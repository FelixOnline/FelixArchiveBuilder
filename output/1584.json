Fewer\nevents are reducing the time spent\nbetween seniors and freshers, making\nit harder to encourage integration.\nMotivating hall seniors to organise\nevents is also harder; organising a\nfilm night isn\u2019t quite the same as a\nboat party.\n\u00a3220,000 is fully affordable for\ncollege.

These funds, used to\ncover the costs of events put on in\nHalls, have been reduced in size. The\nfallout has been particularly noticeable during the past two weeks.\nWe\u2019ve spoke to a lot of Hall Seniors,\nSub Wardens, Wardens and Freshers themselves to see their side of the\nstory. We have also been in contact\nwith the College to hear their reasoning behind the changes too. It seems\nthat College, for the most part, are\nwell meaning, or at least, this is how\nthey have come across to Felix in\nemails and telephone calls.\nHowever, facts and figures don\u2019t lie.\nWe\u2019ve taken the funds allocated per\nHall this year, and then compared\nthem to last year, and the change\nseems startling. Although the College reasons that these cuts are to\nput money back into the pockets of\nnew students, we have yet to receive\nfigures that confirms this. Some preliminary models have suggested that\nthis may be the case, but at the time of\nprint, we have heard nothing to back\nthis up despite several emails asking\nfor the figures to be sent to us.\nIt comes down to transparency\nagain, a buzzword thrown around\nby staff, students and sabbaticals\nalike. This new move, to transfer\nthe financial responsibility to Hall\nCommittees and let the students see\nhow their money is being controlled,\nis fantastic. The sad part of the story\nis that Halls have been given only half\n(or even less) of the money they have\nhad in previous years, and the knock\non effect this has had during this fortnight has been particularly tangible.\nFelix has tried to put both sides of\nthis story across; we\u2019ve published a\nstatement from Debra Humphris, the\nVice Provost of Education who was\non the Residence Experience Review\npanel and a driving force behind\nthe change. We also gathered many\ndifferent quotes from those who have\nbeen affected by the change in funds.\nFor the most part, it seems like a lot\nof the issues have stemmed from an\nissue in communication between the\nCollege and students, and hopefully\nour coverage can clear up some of\nthe misconceptions surrounding the\nwhole issue.\nWe\u2019ve also covered the first nonalcoholic event of the year that the\nUnion have organised, known as\nDri. We had sabbaticals and college\nstaff alike visiting the office to \u201chave\na look\u201d at the article, and then, moments before we are to go to print, the\nUnion released a blog post on their\nwebsite about the event, in an apparent attempt to \u201cbeat us to it.\u201d\nThe blog, allegedly written by Chris\nKaye, Deputy President (Welfare),\nstated that \u201cWhilst the Union ran, organised and delivered tens of events\nin the last two weeks that have almost\nentirely been a sell-out, beaten budget\nand been received well by our mem-bers, our fine newspaper has decided\nto report on this event only.\u201d\nWe chose to report on this event\nbecause it was the only event that was\nactually newsworthy. The Union runs\nFreshers\u2019 events every year, and every\nyear they are a success. Every year\nfreshers\u2019 turn up, buy alcohol, social-ise, and then leave. This year was no\ndifferent. The Dri night was the first\ntime the Union tried something new,\nand credit to them, but we are here to\nhold them to account as much as to\nherald their praises, which I think our\nrather semi-serious, tongue-in-cheek\narticle manages to do.\nAs the union showed on Thursday\nevening, they have their own channels to communicate to students\noutside of Felix, and we would suggest\nthat if they want to use us that they\nsend us pictures and articles in time\nfor the deadline.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nSKETT\u2019S BOX OF SHAME\nApologies for the many mistakes in\nissue 1583.

Imagine\nthat 37,000 people a year die in this\ncountry because of it. There is no\nspecific cure. What treatment there\nis can take weeks to come into effect\nand can often cause problems of its\nown. Every year, 100,000 people in\nthe UK (and their families) don\u2019t have\nto imagine this terrible scenario. The\ncondition, sepsis, is very real and very\ndeadly.\nSometimes referred to as\nsepticaemia, sepsis is a severe\ncondition that results in more than\n100,000 people in the UK being\nhospitalised annually. Commonly\nknown as blood poisoning, it occurs\nwhen microbes (usually bacteria)\ninvade the bloodstream, causing\ninflammation and organ damage.\nIt can quickly develop into septic\nshock, in which blood pressure drops\nto a dangerously low level. 60% of\npatients are likely to die.\nThe most effective way to treat\nsevere sepsis is using antibiotics\nspecifically targeted against the\nbacteria in the blood. Unfortunately,\nit can take several days to determine\nthe best drugs to use, and, with the\npatient\u2019s condition deteriorating\nrapidly, treatment must begin\nimmediately with less effective\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics.\nNow imagine that sepsis had a\nseemingly miraculous cure. This too,\nis now becoming reality. This year,\nscientists from Wyss Institute for\nBiologically Inspired Engineering,\nBoston and Harvard Medical School\nhave collaborated to produce \u2018the\nbio-spleen\u2019. Their design is simple; to\nemploy magnets to remove the sepsis\ncausing bacteria from the blood in\njust a few hours.\nTheir inspiration came from\nwithin the body itself. The device\nacts as an artificial spleen, which can\nautomatically remove toxins and\npathogens from the blood without\nidentifying the infection first.\nThe artificial spleen\u2019s design is as\nelegant as its concept. It works by\nattaching the device to the veins of\nthe infected individual and taking\nthe blood out of the body, much\nlike a dialysis machine, then extra-corporeally mixing the blood of the\ninfected individual with magnetic\nnanobeads coated with an engineered\nhuman opsonin-mannose-binding\nlectin (MBL).\nMBL recognizes carbohydrate\npatterns found on the surface of a\nlarge number of pathogenic micro-organisms, including bacteria,\nviruses, protozoa and fungi. When\nthe offending toxins and pathogens\nhave been captured they are removed\nfrom the blood by magnets, the\n\u2018clean\u2019 blood is then returned to the\npatient\u2019s body.\nIn the group\u2019s experiments,\nrats were infected with E.coli and\nStaphylococcus aureus. After the\nblood cleansing treatment, more\nthan 90% of the bacteria had been\nremoved. Furthermore, bacterial\ninfiltration to the organs was also\nsignificantly reduced. The team has\npostulated that patient survival rates\nmay improve in the event of a septic\nshock after a treatment of only 5\nhours.\nSo far the biospleen has only been\ntested in animal models and in vitro\nsamples of human blood. So what can\nwe expect from the device in a clinical\nscenario?\nThe scientists are clearly optimistic.\nIn human blood models, the team\ncontrolled for various factors such\nThe artificial 'biospleen' is designed to treat sepsis by filtering out pathogens using magnets. Photo: Wyss Institute\nArtificial spleen could treat blood poisoning\nIndira Mallik on how to clean blood using magnets\nas multiple infections, and found\nthe removal rates were consistently\nabove 90% after a single pass through\nthe device. Sepsis develops so rapidly\nand is so devastating because of the\nhuge pathogen loads involved. The\nbiospleen acts to reduce that.\nSome patients may balk at the idea\nof being hooked up to a machine\nfor 5 hours but currently there is no\nspecific drug treatment since Xigris,\nthe only targeted drug developed for\nsepsis, was taken off the market in\n2011.\nWith further development, the\nbiospleen could well provide a more\neffective treatment in the future.\nWe are entering an era in medical\nscience where antibiotic use,\nespecially that of broad spectrum\nantibiotics is to be cautioned against\nbecause of a rise in antibiotic\nresistance. Broad spectrum\nantibiotics also have the nasty habit\nof producing severe side effects in\nalready very unwell individuals.\nMany sepsis patients could\nbenefit from such a device but it\ncould prove life saving for those\nespecially at risk those suffering\nfrom antibiotic-resistant infection,\nthe immunosuppressed such as\ntransplant patients, and babies\nsuffering from fungal infections.\nMost importantly, from the patient\u2019s\nperspective, the treatment is quick\nand relieves the patient from staying\nin intensive care units for days and\nsuffering long term organ damage\nthat may lead to dependence on\ndialysis machines.\nThe biospleen may take some time\nto become available to the general\npublic as in vivo trials still need to\ncarried out. But one thing is certain:\nthe chance of treatment won\u2019t be\na day too soon for the millions of\npatients that contract sepsis each\nyear.\nDOI 10.1038/nm.3640\nSepsis kills\n37,000\npeople each\nyear in the\nUK alone\nAfter the\ntreatment,\nmore than\n90% of the\nbacteria\nhad been\nremoved\n\n"

Critics are singling out the\nperformances, Carell\u2019s in particular,\nand the film is looking to be a\nfrontrunner in this year\u2019s awards\nrace.\nWhiplash: Accenture Gala\nAlready a big winner at Sundance\nearlier this year, both with the critics\nand the public (they don\u2019t always see\neye to eye), as well as enjoying some\nexcellent publicity at Telluride and\nToronto, this indie hit tells the story\nof a gifted young jazz drummer (Miles\nTeller) and his ruthless mentor (J. K.\nSimmons) who pushes his student\nto achieve greatness. Get ready for a\nwholly original music drama.\nMen, Women & Children:\nVirgin Atlantic Gala\nCritically-acclaimed director Jason\nReitman returns with Men, Women\n& Children this year, focusing on\nthe challenges of raising a family\nin today\u2019s world run by technology.\nRegardless of age or gender, there\nare problems that affect us all, as\nReitman explores the difficulties\nof keeping it all together, starring\nan ensemble cast of Adam Sandler,\nJennifer Garner, Judy Greer and\nmore.\nWild: May Fair Hotel Gala\nReese Witherspoon is hoping for\na comeback, given how a string of\nunremarkable roles have taken over\nher career post-Oscar-win. Directed\nby Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, Wild finds\nWitherspoon as a reckless, destructive\naddict going on a self-healing solo\nhike across the Pacific Crest Trail.\nThe film itself is receiving mixed\nreviews, but Witherspoon is winning\npraise for her performance.\nTestament of Youth:\nCentrepiece Gala\nBased on Vera Brittain\u2019s first\ninstallment of her memoir, Testament\nof Youth is being brought to the\nbig screen. It will cover the period\nof 1900-1925 in Brittain\u2019s life, in\nwhich she describes the impact of\nthe First World War on women.\nSwedish actress Alicia Vikander\n(Anna Karenina, A Royal Affair, The\nFifth Estate) stars as Brittain, with\nBrit talent Kit Harington playing her\nfianc\u00e9, Roland Leighton.\nRosewater: Debate Gala\nJon Stewart, perhaps best known\nfor his work in the United States\nas a talk-show host, makes his\ndirectorial debut portraying the\nstory of Maziar Bahari (Gael Garcia\nBernal), an Iranian Canadian\njournalist, who was incarcerated by\nthe Iranian government for 188 days.\nIt promises to be a well-crafted, tense\npolitical drama with some powerful\nperformances from the cast.\nMommy: Dare Gala\nXavier Dolan is somewhat of a\ncritical darling, given how successful\nhis films have been in the festival\ncircuit. His films are certainly not\nfor mainstream audiences, dealing\nwith complex, controversial issues.\nHis latest feature film, Mommy, is his\nbest-reviewed work yet, dealing with\na widowed mother trying to raise her\nviolent son alone, when a neighbour\nenters her life to help out.\nA Little Chaos: Love Gala\nDirector Alan Rickman also stars in\nthis period piece, playing King Louis\nXIV, who hires a gardener in the form\nof Sabine De Barra (Kate Winslet) to\ntransform his garden at the Palace of\nVersailles. There is initial resistance\nfrom the strict garden chief (Matthias\nSchoenaerts), but with her fresh new\ninnovative ideas she starts to charm\nall those around her.\nWild Tales: Laugh Gala\nBrought to you by producer Pedro\nAlmodovar, this comedy offering\nseems to live up to its name of\nbeing outrageously hilarious. As six\nseparate wildly funny tales come\ntogether for the final climax, critics at\nCannes were clearly pleased enough\nwith the result. It is a dark comedy for\nsure, with its humour focusing on the\ntroubles of modern life.\nThe Salvation: Thrill Gala\nSet in the Wild West where the\nrules are there are no rules; the\ncharismatic Mads Mikkelsen is off\non a quest for vengeance (aren\u2019t they\nalways?), tracking down the murderer\nof his family. Things don\u2019t end just\nwith hunting down that one man\nhowever, as there are more betrayals\nin store for him, setting up a tough,\nbloody mission with a rising body\ncount.\nWinter Sleep: Journey Gala\nThis three-hour long (196 minutes to\nbe more precise) epic was a crowd-divider when it debuted at Cannes\nearlier this year, although that did\nnot stop it from walking away with\nthe festival\u2019s top honour, the Palme\nd\u2019Or. Love it or hate it, this Turkish\nepic is one for the more inquisitive\ncinema-goers, to see if you can\nappreciate it in any way or not.\nvisual effects but more impressively,\nnever loses track of the very human\nnarrative at its centre.\nShowing18:30Tuesday21stand21:00\nThursday23rd\nThe Fault in Our Stars\nDirector: Josh Boone\nScreenplay: Scott Neustadter,\nMichael H.Weber,John Green (novel)\nCast: Chris Pratt,Zoe Saldana,Dave\nBautista,Vin Diesel,Bradley Cooper\nAdapted from the best-selling Young\nAdult novel of the same name,The\nFaultinOurStarstells the love story\nof two teenagers who meet at a\ncancer support group.\nWhen Hazel Lancaster's (Shailene\nWoodley) thyroid cancer suddenly\nworsens,she is forced by her mother\nto attend a support group for teens\nwith cancer.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 23\n17.10.2014\nFELIX\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTop 5 Memberships\nThere are a good number of\nreasons why you may want\nto join one or more of the\nplethora of membership schemes\noffered across the capital. Do you\nwant to show off to everyone how\ncultured you are? Maybe you simply\ncan\u2019t stand to queue. Perhaps you\nrelish going to members-only areas.\nHopefully though, the number one\nreason is that you love soaking up\nany exhibition that comes flying onto\nyour radar. And so I\u2019ve compiled a\nlist of my memberships, answering\nquestions like \u201cIs it worth the\nmoney?\u201d ; \u201cwhat benefits do I get?\u201d ;\nand most importantly \u201cwhat is the\nmembers\u2019 bar like?\u201d\n5Royal Museums\nGreenwich\nThis is not one that a lot of people\nwould have considered but this\ngives you access to a collection of\nunderappreciated museums. You\u2019ll\nget free access to the Cutty Sark, the\nRoyal Observatory, The Meridian\nCourtyard and to any and all special\nexhibitions held at these locations.\nMembership is \u00a335 for students and\nalso grants you access to lectures,\ntours and other events, a lovely\nmembers room and a quarterly\nnewsletter. If you are particularly\ninterested in astronomy, you can join\nthe Flamsteed Astronomy Society for\nan extra \u00a328 for lectures from leading\nastronomers and viewing sessions,\nincluding the opportunity to use\nthe 28-inch telescope and the solar\ntelescope.\nThe Tate\nThis a big membership, giving\nentry to all the Tate Galleries\u2019 special\nexhibitions and, other than the art\nfund, is the membership that gives\nyou access to the most exhibitions.\nWith the membership you will also\nget access to members rooms at the\nTate Britain and Tate Modern, the\nlatter having a rooftop terrace with\ncommanding views over the City and\nSt Paul\u2019s. So why isn\u2019t this higher up\nthe list then? Well it really is quite\nexpensive, as membership starts\nat \u00a369 for individual membership,\nwith no discount for students and\naside from the expected free entry to\nexhibitions and the magazine, there\nreally are no more member benefits.\nHence, it entirely boils down to the\nquestion, \u201cWill I visit an exhibition\nat the Tate five or more times a year?\u201d\nIf yes, then become a member, you\u2019ll\nsave money. If no, then don\u2019t bother,\nthey don\u2019t offer enough additional\nbenefits to make it worth paying over\nthe odds for access.\nThe British Museum\nOnly \u00a342 a year for membership;\nyou have no doubt visited and\nthoroughly enjoyed the British\nMuseum before. In my opinion, they\nput together some of the very best\nspecial exhibitions that exist in the\ncapital. Membership allows you free\naccess to all exhibitions and there\nare also late night members\u2019 hours,\na fantastic way to see the standing\ncollections without the throngs of\ntourists congesting every nook and\ncranny of the museum. In addition,\nyou\u2019ll get invites to lectures, films,\nand guided talks. As with all the\nmemberships, you\u2019ll receive a\nmagazine thrice a year, and this one\nis actually a good read and really\nadds something to the membership.\nAll in all, if you frequent the British\nMuseum then this is certainly a\nmembership worth buying.\nNational Art Pass\nAn absolute steal at \u00a329 (\u00a321.75\nif you pay by direct debit) for the\nyear and if you were to buy only\none membership I\u2019d suggest this\nas it gives you such broad benefits.\nThis includes free access to over\n200 museums, galleries and historic\nhouses in the UK including Apsley\nHouse, 2 Willow Road and the Fan\nMuseum (not as good as it sounds).\nYou also get 50%off exhibitions at a\nlot of places including all the Tates\n(except St. Ives), all the Exhibition\nRoad museums, the British Museum,\nthe National Gallery, the National\nPortrait Gallery and a number of\nOne of the best arts deals in London, with only \u00a345 a year giving you access to the multitude\nof exhibitions across the year. Photo: Creative Commons\nJack Leese looks the capital\u2019s best art memberships\nothers. This \u2018jack of all trades, master\nof none\u2019 membership is a very useful\none to have and I would advise getting\nit despite the lack of some of the perks\nof other memberships.\nThe Royal Academy of\nArts\nMembership aside, it\u2019s an absolute\ngem of a gallery. Unusually, there is\nno standing collection but instead\na high turnover of excellent feature\nshows. Every summer they hold their\nSummer Exhibition, as they have\ndone since 1769 without fail, and it is\nusually my favourite exhibition with\nover a thousand pieces of art hung,\ngiving a fantastic cross-section of the\nart world of the moment. Becoming a\nfriend of the R.A. is only \u00a345 if you\u2019re\nunder 25, and \u00a397 if you happen to\nbe older. Given that the exhibitions\nusually cost around \u00a315, that\u2019s only\nthree visits a year to cover your costs.\nYou will also get invited to members-only previews of all the exhibitions,\nlate opening hours, and access to\nThe Keeper\u2019s House with its several\nlounges, coffee room, excellent\ncocktail bar and private garden, as\nwell as lecture theatres if you fancy\nattending one of their free lectures.\nYou will also receive the quarterly\nR.A. magazine, one of the better\nmagazines which doesn\u2019t solely focus\non it\u2019s own exhibitions. Additionally,\nthis membership allows entry for a\nguest without having to pay extra for\na guest card. What I\u2019m trying to say is\nthat if you decide to take the plunge\nand become a member of a gallery,\nthe R.A. is definitely the one you\nshould join above all others.\n\"Do you\nwant to\nshow off to\neveryone\nhow\ncultured\nyou are?\"\n\"The\nNational\nArt Pass is\nan absolute\nsteal at \u00a329\nper year...\nit gives\nyou broad\nbenefits\"\nFreshers\u2019Fortnight has finally\nfinished.The floor of the union\nhas regained its sticky residue\nof spilled pints that was so\nthoroughly scrubbed away over\nthe summer; red lanyards lie\nscattered and abandoned around\ncampus like so many red poppies\non the 12th of November; your\nliver will never be the same\nagain.\nSo as people begin to piece\nthemselves back together after\ntwo weeks of madness,we\nthought that it was the perfect\ntime to put out a bumper art\nsection,detailing all the cultural\nactivites that London has to offer.\nWe start off with our Artist's\nGuidetoLondon,a compendium\nof all the best places to visit in\nLondon,curated by your trusty\neditors.Whether you have a\nthing for classical sculpture,\nor are already salivating at\nthe thought of this season's\nnew contemporary dance\nprogramme,you will find\nsomething to suit.\nAs well as covering the main\ngalleries and venues,we answer\nan age old question: Private\nGalleries:Whataretheyallabout?,\nhelping you make sense of all\nthe spaces popping up around\nLondon.Don't worry if you're not\nan oligarch art collector; all you\nneed to do to fit in at these places\nis buy a black turtleneck from\nH&M and talk about how the\nwork\u2018just speaks to you\u2019.\nIt can be difficult to afford to\ngo to all the exhibitions you want\nto on a student's budget.Luckily,\nJack Leese has investigated which\ngalleries offer the best student\nmemberships,and reports\nback with his Top5Memberships,\nhelping you get the most out of\nyour student loan (why spend all\nthat dough at the union when\nyou could be seeing the hottest\nKlee exhibit!?)\nFinally,wehaveacoupleof\narticlesfromtheImperialFine\nArtsSocietyLeoSoc,andImperial\nArchitecturalSociety,whichonly\nstartedupthisyear.Hopefully\ntheseshouldgiveyouanideaof\nwhethertheseplacesareforyou.\nAlso,manyapologiestothose\n\u2013andweknowthisismostof\nyou\u2013whopickupFelixforthesole\npurposeofseeingtheCentrefold.\nDuetoadearthofeligibledongs\nthisweek,wehavereplacedthe\nCentrefold.Butdon\u2019tdespair;after\nall,whatcouldbesexierthanart?\nEditorial:\nThe End of\nFreshers\u2019\nFRED FYLES & KAMIL\nMcCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\n\n"

In\nan editorial posted on the paper\u2019s\nwebsite, Editor in Chief Jess Buckley\nexpressed her disappointment with\nthe Leicester union\u2019s decision to hold\nback publication by 72 hours whilst\nthe executive committee determined\nif a story on the front page violated a\nnumber of rules.\nUnlike at Imperial, media groups\nat Leicester are required to have\ntheir output approved by the Union\nprior to publication or broadcast\nfollowing the introduction of a\n\u201cMedia Constitution\u201d . The article in\nquestion related to criticisms of the\nongoing elections at the university,\nasking whether \u201cthere is a lack of\nengagement\u201d. According to the\nRipple, the union accused the paper\nof writing a number of inaccuracies\nand violating the constitution.\nUpon probing as to what exactly\nthe offending text was, no concrete\nanswer was provided. The issue\nwas then ultimately authorised\nfor publication with no changes 72\nhours after being first sent in for\nauthorisation.\nAccording to rules at the union,\na media publication or broadcast\ncan only be pulled if it contains\ncontent which is illegal, libellous, or\nunconstitutional. Where a student\npaper is not its own distinct legal\nentity (both Felix and the Ripple fall\ninto this category), legal challenges\nagainst the first two points would fall\nto the union\u2019s trustees and not the\npaper; whereas constitutional matters\nare a purely internal affair. The\nrequirement for authorisation could\nbe seen as an attempt for the Union to\n\u2018cover its own back\u2019.\nStudents have reacted angrily to\nthe attempt to censure the paper.\nOn the Ripple\u2019s website, one reader\ncomplained against the \u201cdraconian\u201d\nnature of union authorisation for\narticles; arguing \u201cno wonder The Tab\nis so popular\u201d.\nA group have students have now\nstarted a campaign for a referendum\nto prevent the union from banning\npublication.\nPHIL KENT\nImperial Professors\nwin awards\nTwo Imperial College academics\nhave recently been awarded\nhonours by their professional\nbodies, recognising outstanding\nachievement in their fields. Honorary\nFellowship of the Institute of Physics\n(IoP) has been awarded to Professor\nSir Peter Knight, an Emeritus Professor in Physics, while Professor Chris\nToumazou has been awarded with the\nFaraday Medal.\nSir Peter\u2019s award has been made in\nrecognition of his contributions to\nPhysics throughout his career. His\nresearch has focused on quantum\nphysics; specifically optics and information science.\nThe Fellowship was also made in\nrecognition of both his work with\nthe IoP, and also a number of other\nresponsibilities he has held. These\nresponsibilities include being Head\nof the Physics Department, Deputy\nRector, and playing a key role in setting up a number of research centres\nwithin the College.\nHonorary Fellowship is the highest\nhonour that the Institute of Physics\ncan award to its members.\nMeanwhile, Prof. Toumazou\u2019s\nFaraday Medal was awarded for this\nresearch into semiconductor DNA\nsequencing. This work is significant\nas it allows for the medical profession\nto eventually move away from treating illnesses in the traditional sense\nto targeted treatment and prevention.\nAdditionally, there is the potential\nfor semiconductor DNA sequencing\nto save costs, being much cheaper\nthan conventional equipment.\nProf. Toumazou, who works in the\nDepartment of Electrical and Electronic Engineering department, has\nalso been involved in the creation of\na \u2018while you wait\u2019 DNA testing retail\nshop, where \u2018customers\u2019 can have\ntheir genes analysed in 30 minutes.\nThis has not been Prof. Toumazou\u2019s\nfirst award in recent years. In 2013, he\nwas presented with a Regius Professorship on the occasion of the Queen\u2019s\nJubilee. At 33, he became Imperial\u2019s\nyoungest professor.\nProf. Toumazou was also named\nEuropean Inventor of the Year in\nJune, as reported by Felix at the end of\nthat month.\nPHIL KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\n\"One reader\nargued...\n'No wonder\nthe tab\nis so\npopular.'\"\n\"This has\nnot been\nProf.\nToumazou's\nfirst award\nin recent\nyears\"\nDEPUTY EDITOR\nThe Boston Consulting Group is an equal opportunity employer.

It is unclear as\nyet whether the budget has held, but\nthe costs seem so far to have been true\nto predictions.\nIn terms of the work left, George\nassures us that they have reached \u201cthe\nfinal push\u201d.

There will also be an ongoing\nmaintenance plan, to ensure that the\nfacility does not deteriorate.\nWhen interviewed in January, Yas\nEdwards (then the DPCS) stated that\nthe redevelopment should allow\ndrama and music groups to make\nregular use of the space.\nIt is unclear how this will be\nadministrated, with large portions\nof the term already booked out for\nDramSoc, MTSoc and Imperial\nCinema events.\nA video released a fortnight ago\npurported to show Islamic State\nbeheading British hostage Alan\nHenning.\nseasons with the Los Angeles Lakers.\nHe was a record six-time winner of\nthe NBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player\naward and was chosen in the NBA\nAll-Star nineteen times, another\nrecord.\nPhoto: Associated Press\n\n"

As part of the Residential Experience the panel were keen to make the\nway the funding worked more transpar-ent. The fund should be uniform per\nstudent, so students know how much\nthey spend and what it is spent on for\nhall activities.\nThe move of amenities funds from college to the union is rather positive: hall\ncommittees now control the money and\nthe funds, with the support of the Hall\nWarden. Whilst the funds are collected\nby the College, they are transferred\nstraight into a pot that the union then\ndistributes across halls. Students are\ninvolved in the decision making when\nspending the money.\nThe motivation was to leave money\nin students\u2019 pockets, and we are always mindful of students who have a\nhousehold with an income of less than\n\u00a320,000 and for whom coming to a\nuniversity in the most expensive area of\nthe country is a challenge.\nThe panel originally decided that\na flat figure of \u00a31.00 per student per\nweek would be acceptable, but Marissa\nLewis and David Goldsmith said around\n\u00a31.50 would be better. Given that the\naccommodation costs had already been\npublished, the Provost\u2019s Board accepted\nthis change and agreed that the funds to\nmake up the difference, \u00a342,500 would\nbe found from the Education Office as a\none off.\nThere will now be a review in January\neach year involving students, the Union\nand the College to define what the fund\nshould be the following year.\nHall committees now have full control\nof the money and they need to ensure\nthat they use the money for events that\nappeal to as many residents as possible.\nWorking with the wardens the Hall\nCommittees manage their funds across\nthe year. Given that much of the fund is\nused on the Welcome Week, it would be\nreally helpful if hall committees could\nhelp shape the welcome for the next\nintake. Using the Union\u2019s online services\nto manage the fund, this provides greater\ntransparency, which has been received\npositively.\nAnother outcome of the review was the\nencouragement of greater transparency\nabout rents and work on this is being\ntaken forward by the Chief Financial Officer and Vice Provost (Education). Rent\nincreases year on year are influenced by\ninflation and costs including bills for\nenergy, cleaning, depreciation.\nBefore now, there was no student input\nin the rent costs, we want to change this.\nProfessor Debra Humphris, Vice Provost (Education)\n\u201cHall seniors\nwere only\ntold about\nthe cuts\ntwo weeks\nbefore...\u201d\nDebra Humphris, the Vice Provost (Education) has overall responsibility for educational strategy and the\nquality of the educational provision and across the College. She presented recommendations for changes as\na result of the Residential Experience Review, which resulted in the inital proposal to assign \u00a31 per student\nper week.

If\nthe stage is known then appropriate\nsurgical procedures can be performed\nminimising the risk and potential\nimpact on fertility. A more accurate\nmethod for diagnosing ovarian\ntumours before surgery would\ntherefore help doctors prioritise\npatients for treatment based on the\nseverity of their condition, improving\nthe overall efficiency and flow of care.\nExisting models can help doctors\ndiscriminate between benign and\nmalignant tumours but a lack of\naccuracy and the ability to further\nsub-classify tumours into their\ndifferent classes doesn\u2019t exist.\nThis is all about to change, with\nresearch from an international team\nled by Imperial College London and\nKU Leauven, Belgium. With their\ncombined efforts a new test, called\nADNEX, has been developed that\nis able to discern between not only\nbenign and malignant tumours, but\nalso reliably distinguish between\nmore specific stages of benign,\ninvasive and metastatic ovarian\ntumours.\nProfessor Tom Bourne, from the\nDepartment of Surgery and Cancer at\nImperial College London, said \u201cAt the\nmoment, the way we assess women\nwith ovarian cysts for the presence\nof cancer and select treatment lacks\naccuracy. This new approach to\nclassifying ovarian tumours can help\ndoctors make the right management\ndecisions, which will improve the\noutcome for women with cancer.\u201d\nThe ADNEX test is based on details\nof patients such as tumour marker\nblood tests and features that can\nbe determined on an ultrasound\nscan, giving not only an accurate\nidentification of the type of tumour\nbut also gives the confidence of\ndiagnosis as a percentage.\nThe research looks sound, having\nused an extensive data set from 3,506\npatients from over 10 EU countries\nbetween 1999 and 2007 the team\nhas determined which information\navailable before an operation could be\nused to predict the diagnosis and then\ntested the model on a further 2,403\npatients between 2009 and 2012.\nIncredibly, doctors can even\nenter the patient\u2019s details into a\nsmartphone app \u2013 giving a futuristic\nefficiency to the medical procedure.\nThe test is available online from\niotagroup.org.\nThe results from this extensive\nGood news for authors of\nphysics textbooks! As we\u2019ve\nlong believed, the decay of\nradioactive isotopes doesn\u2019t fluctuate\ndepending on the time of year.\nSo why is this news? In 2012, a paper\nwas published by a group at Purdue\nUniversity that seemed to show the\nrate of decay of Chlorine-36 varied\nperiodically over the course of the\nyear.\nBased on the times when the decay\nwas fastest, the authors speculated\nthat neutrinos emitted from the Sun\ncould be causing this variation if\nthe earth is closer to the sun, more\nneutrinos will hit the chlorine nuclei\nand this will cause more decays and\nmore radiation to be emitted.\nNeutrinos are produced when\nradioactive nuclei decay to release\nbeta particles. On the face of it then,\nit seems reasonable that they could\nbe used to provoke a nucleus to decay\nand emit radiation.\nThe trouble with this theory is that\nneutrinos are notoriously unwilling\nto react with anything at all. Just\ndetecting their presence requires\nhuge underground caverns filled\nwith detectors, and even then, only\na tiny handful of the trillions that\npass through each minute will ever be\npicked up.\nA team of physicists in Germany\nhave used a different equipment\nset up to see if they could replicate\nthese apparent fluctuations. Their\nresults, published in the journal\nAstroparticle Physics showed that the\ndifferences between measurements\nare an order of magnitude smaller\nthan those seen in the previous\nresearch. What\u2019s more, the variation\nwas completely random, showing no\nrelationship with the time of year\nand casting further doubt on the solar\nneutrino theory. The same group\nhas also produced similar results\nfor Strontium-90 which showed no\nseasonal variation in its rate of decay.\nWhile this new research may not\nseem quite as exciting as a ground-breaking, textbook-rewriting\nnew discovery, it is a rather nice\ndemonstration of the scientific\nprocess, and does confirm that what\nwe think we know about radioactivity\ndoes still seem to be accurate.\nDOI 10.1016/j.astropartphys\nstudy, published this week in the\nBritish Medical Journal, signify a\nhuge medical advancement in the way\ndoctors treat ovarian cancer patients\nand will hopefully give more reliable\ndiagnoses and further reduce the risks\nassociated with such diseases.\nDOI 10.1136/bmj.g5920\n\"Correct\nmedical\nassessment\nof women\nwith\novarian\ncancer is\nessential\"\n\"Decay of\nradioactive\nisotomes\ndoesn't\nfluctuate\ndepending\non the time\nof year\"\nGiving old research a new lease of life Photo: Discover magazine\n\n"

If the bar\u2019s slammed, make\nsure you\u2019re already ready to order by\nthe time they get round to you.\nThat goes for you groups as well \u2013\neither order one by one, or have the\nfull group order ready to go when\nasked. If you\u2019re still looking over your\nshoulder trying to get your friend\u2019s\ndrink order when we get to you,\nwe\u2019ll probably move on to the next\ncustomer.\nIt also helps us a lot more if you\u2019ve\ndone a bit of research on the type\nof drinks sold at the establishment\nyou\u2019re patronising, and act/order\naccordingly. If the bar only does craft\ncocktails and you go in there asking\nfor a pint, you\u2019re just looking for\ntrouble.

It\u2019s also the\nbest way to get on our good side.\nWhere possible, tip in cash as it\u2019s\nthe easiest for us to take home there\nand then; if you\u2019re tipping on card,\nremember card fees are a money-suck\nso adjust your amounts accordingly.\n\"IT'S MY BIRTHDAY\", \"I\nKNOW THE OWNER\" AND\nOTHER FREEBIE-BAIT\nEXCUSES\nThese phrases seem to be commonly\nfollowed by the phrase \u201chook me up,\nwill ya?\u201d Without fail, those two are\nmy favorite things to hear every shift.\nEvery.

I hope\nthose of you who caught our Foodie InSight with\nour curry-pro Michelle last week enjoyed it; we'll be\nlooking to do that every other week or every month\nfrom now on.\nIf you're still too chicken (hah!) to start having a\ngo at making your own,the Felix editors can highly\nrecommend the offerings at the new Fusion 54\noutlet on the Sherfield walkway.They tend to sell\nout very quickly,so I'd make sure you get your hands\non their wares the minute lunch starts! Portions are\ndecently sized,and they do fill you up nicely for the\nmoney-curry or otherwise.And of course,they taste\nabsolutely great.Incidentally this editorial was\nFuel-ed (hah!) by F54\u2019s chicken korma,which I\u2019m\neating at my desk as I type.\nThis week's Food column very nearly didn't happen,\nas writing about cocktails/alcohol in a student paper\nis generally a toughie.I did say in my last editorial to\nlook out for something along the lines of cocktailing,\nbut as an editor I'm constantly conscious about\nwhat kind of message I'm sending out with the\npages I curate.We were hoping to go with a feature\non making your own craft cocktails on low budgets\n(and still making sure they taste good),but we're still\nstuck in the process of trying to get it down without\nseeming like we\u2019re encouraging binge drinking.After\nall,including the recent BoatGate,we've already\nhad enough controversies to contend with here at\nImperial.\nThat said,we're not keen on being nanny-ish or\nimposing our own values on our readers.So while\nwe\u2019ve sent that student budget craft-cocktail feature\nback to the drawing board (to find out how best\nto not alienate our readers),we've brought back\nServerella,our resident service industry expert snark,\nto teach you how to bar hop like a (skint) pro.\nI'm really excited for next week's issue,as we've\ngot a few different things lined up from our writers.\nThese include a detailed breakdown on making the\nperfect macaroni cheese (mac n\u2019cheese to me,blame\nmy partially American vocabulary) as well as a list of\nkitchen hacks.They look really promising,and I hope\nyou're looking forward to the issue as much as I am.\nAs always,do get in touch if you've got a great little\nplace/thing you'd like to recommend,comments on\nanything we've written so far,or an idea for a feature\nyou'd like to see.Better still if you can write it; though\nif you're too shy you could pitch the idea and maybe it\nmight be picked up by one of our writing team\u2013who\nknows? Keep on eating,living and laughing,guys!\n\n"

All\nequipped with as many dollars as\nwe could afford we headed to a well\nknown currency district to exchange,\nan event that changed our lives\nforever. Having arrived in Argentina\nmerely as members of both the lower\nand middle classes of the West we\nwere not ready for the pressures\nthat came with being a billionaire.\nBillionaire, I kid you not. Having\ngoogled what to do when you win the\nlottery we went to our first restaurant\nand ordered copious amounts of\nmeat and red wine in an attempt to\nspend our money. The booze and beef\narrived, however the bill never did. It,\nlike everything else, was free.\nThe first game came round like\nShuz in a drive through. Fast.

When we\nwere initially confronted with this\nunfamiliar and frankly complicated\nname our Spanish speaker Ciro\nthankfully stepped in and told us to\ncall him Nathan.\nThe remaining members of the tour\nflew in on the 6th day to bring our\nnumbers up to the dizzying heights of\n18. Keen to get straight into the flow\nof things they hit the bar, resulting\nin the destruction of a hairdresser\u2019s\ntoilet, the taking of a shower in some\nsewage and huge amounts of foliage\ndestruction in conjunction with the\nshouting of \u201cWales\u201d and \u201cweakness\u201d.\nWe were so glad they had settled in\nso well.\nGame two saw us lose,\nunfortunately.

Nico Rosberg recovered to finish\nin second place and Valteri Bottas\nutilised the Mercedes engine in the\nback of his Williams to pick up the\nfinal podium position.\nWhilst the race was not one of the\nmost exciting in terms of on-track\naction, there were huge levels of\ncontroversy surrounding a move to\nRussia \u2013 especially in the wake of a\nperceived Russian involvement in the\nUkraine conflict. On the backdrop\nof the Ukrainian government\nannouncing an intention for the\ncountry to join the European Union,\nanti-government and pro-Russian\ngroups protested in the streets in\nmany major towns and cities across\nthe south and east of Ukraine. These\ndemonstrations quickly turned\nviolent with insurgents taking over\nkey strategic positions including\nlocal government offices and border\ncontrol. It has been suggested that\nRussia supplied weaponry and special\nforces ground troops to support those\nwho wanted to rejoin the country.\nVladimir Putin also made it his goal\nto recapture the southern region of\nCrimea which he achieved during the\nheight of the conflict. In an attempt\nto restore order, Ukrainian troops\nhave been sent to the east of the\ncountry but the turmoil is ongoing.\nTo hold a highly regarded world\nsporting event against the backdrop\nof war seems, at least at first glance,\nto be a poor decision. Perhaps this\nis why the race was held in Sochihundreds of miles away from the\nrealities of war and against the\nbackdrop of what Russia aspires to\nbe, in Putin\u2019s favourite city. It is\ncertainly feasible that the race was\na ploy to persuade the rest of the\nworld that Russia could continue\nto host world class events and a\ndemonstration of the wealth that\nthe country still has despite various\nrestrictions applied by the United\nNations.\nFormula 1 is no stranger to\ncontroversy over the destinations it\nvisits. The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix\nwas postponed and subsequently\ncancelled after turmoil in the country\nwhilst the 2012 edition went ahead\ndespite campaigns by groups of\nactivists against the extreme force\nand torture techniques used by the\nBahrain authorities on its people.\nMany of the destinations visited\non the Formula 1 calender are\nplaces where large portions of the\npopulation are incredibly poor and\nthe lavish nature of the Formula 1\ncoupled with the colossal fees paid for\nthe privilege of hosting a race mean\nthat protests occur at many events\nwith the level of public dissatisfaction\nhaving increased in the wake of the\nglobal recession.\nThe sport has always sought to\nshy away from the politics of the\nhost country in the hope that the\nevent can transcend the differences\nbetween people but a race is always\nused as an opportunity to publicise\nthe location. No more so than in\nRussia with coverage of Vladimir\nPutin\u2019s movements included in\nthe television streaming whilst the\nrace was still happening. Significant\ntime was given to shots of Putin and\nBernie Ecclestone in conversation\nsitting in a sparsely populated\ngrandstand. Granted, having one\nof the most powerful world leaders\nturning up at a sporting event means\na great deal in terms of exposure for\nthe sport but they are very rarely\nshown mid race.\nA major part of the success of\nFormula 1 has been the sports ability\nto reach out to the world and attract\na diverse global audience. For a sport\nwith nine teams based in England and\nthe other two still within Europe, it\nseems incredible that people in far off\ncountries would turn out for an event\nof this nature. To extend this to a\npopulation of over 140 million people\nwhilst reaping economic benefits for\nboth parties can only be perceived\nas an excellent idea. However,\nunintentionally or not, the sport has\nbecome a prominent political outlet\nfor the countries it visits and this is\nunacceptable.\nThe event was significantly\novershadowed by the presence of\nVladimir Putin and the coverage that\nhe received during the race. The real\nquestion after this weekend of motor\nsport is Should politics be purged\nfrom Formula 1?\nHENRY LAMBLEY\nWORLD SPORT REPORTER\nImperial College Fencers Lunging to the top\nImperial College has qualified four\nfencers for the individual and\nteam events of the prestigious\n2014 Commonwealth Fencing\nChampionships in Largs, Scotland\nthis November. This event is held\nevery four years; fencing is not part\nof the Commonwealth Games but the\nmedals will be the same as the ones\ngiven in the Commonwealth Games!\nImperial\u2019s fencers are Maiyuran\nRatneswaran (English number\nthree in sabre); Zoe Robinson\n(English number one in sabre);\nGlen Ostacchini, who graduated\nearlier this year but qualified\nwhile still an Imperial student and\ncurrently ranked number one in\nWales in foil; and Jamie Simpson,\nwho will be representing Northern\nIreland in epee \u2013 ranked second in\nNorthern Ireland. Both Maiyuran\nand Jamie have previously competed\nin the Junior Commonwealth\nChampionships, Jamie in the\n2012 Championships in St. Helier,\nJersey and Maiyuran in the 2009\nChampionships in Penang, Malaysia\nwhere he carved up the opposition\nto gain an individual silver and team\ngold. Maiyuran also competed in\nthe 2010 Commonwealth Fencing\nChampionships in Melbourne\nAustralia, where he again slashed his\nway to the podium winning the team\nevent and finishing second in the\nindividual event.\nIt isn\u2019t just fantastic individual\nresults that Imperial can be proud of\nthough \u2013 last year, Imperial Fencing\ngained the most BUCS points of\nany University. Imperial Men\u2019s\n1st team won both the 2013/14\nPremiership South and the 2014\nBUCS Championships remaining\nundefeated, while the Women\u2019s\n1st team won the 2013 BUCS\nChampionships. Imperial also has\nthe most fencing teams of any UK\nUniversity so there are opportunities\nfor anyone to represent the College.\nThe Club isn\u2019t just for the competitive\nthough \u2013 everyone is welcome! If\nyou have been fencing for years,\nhave never picked up a sword before\nor even if you are still sitting on the\nfence, then come along to one of\nour training sessions or sign up to\none of our novice courses that run\nthroughout the year.\nROSS MASKE\nICU SNOWSPORTS\nPhoto: Reuters\n\n"

    "content": "14 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\nTelevision Editors Guila Gabrielli & John Park\nTelevision\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17.10.2014\nCartoon Corner: How The Legend\nof Korra became legendary\nPhoto: CC\nTom Rivlin marvels at Avatar\u2019s baby brother\n\"The fight\nscenes were\nelevated to\nindescribable\nlevels of\nawesome.\"\n\"Book\nThree\nrepresents\nthe first\ntime Korra\nhas been\nas good as\nAvatar.\"\nThe Legend of Korra is a rare\nbreed \u2013 a sequel show to Avatar:\nThe Last Airbender (broadcast in\nthe UK as Avatar: The Legend of Aang\nbecause \u2018bender\u2019 means something\nelse over here). Avatar is my favourite\nshow of all time, so I could easily\nspend the next 1000 words gushing\nover how amazing it is. Instead, let\u2019s\ntalk a bit about Korra, whose final\nseason is airing right now.\nBut first, context Avatar was an\nanimated show that ran for three\nseasons on Nickelodeon from 2005-2008. During its run it gained a small\nbut dedicated fan following, my\nteenage self among them (good times).\nAfter its run the original fandom\nremained, but grew in number thanks\nto word of mouth, Tumblr, streaming\non Netflix etc. There may have been a\nmovie at some point. Let\u2019s move on.\nKorra is set 70 years after the events\nof the first show. It features all new\ncharacters, a new setting and a new\nvillain, whilst retaining the art style\n\u2013 with improved animation quality\n\u2013 continuity and world building. In\nparticular the main character, Korra,\nwas written and designed to be the\nexact opposite of the previous main\ncharacter, Aang.\nWhereas Aang was peace-loving,\nspiritual and carefree, Korra\nis boisterous, aggressive, and\nheadstrong. Where Avatar flew its\ncharacters to various places inspired\nby ancient Asian architecture\n(Chinese, Korean, Tibetan, Japanese\nand more), Korra initially takes\nplace in one city inspired by a blend\nof 1920s Hong Kong, Shanghai and\nManhattan.\nMost importantly though, whereas\neach season of Avatar (called a\n\u2018book\u2019) lasted 20 episodes and had a\nsomewhat loose structure with plenty\nof room for \u2018filler\u2019 episodes (allowing\nfor more character moments, world\nbuilding and thematic stuff), Korra\u2019s\nseasons look more like a mini-series\neach, with around 13 tightly-written,\nhighly structured episodes flowing\nalmost continuously. This led to a\nmuch larger focus on plot and various\nnarrative twists and turns. The whole\nthing seems to be an exercise in\nmaking your sequel as different to the\noriginal as possible.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Korra\u2019s first\n\u2018book\u2019, which came out in 2012, was\nvery successful; people liked the new\ndirection in which the creators were\ntaking their world. The fight scenes \u2013\na high point of Avatar \u2013 were elevated\nto indescribable levels of awesome\nand the new setting simply looked\nreally cool.\nThere were, however, inevitably\ngoing to be criticisms. There was\nless time for character development\n(necessitated by the small number\nof episodes, of course). There\nwas an annoying subplot about a\nlove triangle (or would that be a\nquadrangle?), and some people found\nthe characters annoying.\nMany people also thought the\nending was rushed, and resolved all\nof the loose ends too neatly. This was\nprobably because the creators didn\u2019t\nexpect the show to be renewed and\nfelt they had to wrap it all up.\nOverall, was it a \u2018worthy successor\u2019\nto Avatar? Most thought so, to a\ndegree. Was it as good? Most thought\nnot. But how could it be? How could\nthey make a near-perfect show twice\nin a row when they took so many risks\nand changed so much?\nThankfully, the show did get\nrenewed. Amazingly, Nickelodeon\nordered three more seasons at once\n\u2013 40 more episodes in total (for\nreference, each episode is estimated\nto cost about a million dollars to\nproduce). Suddenly, the creators\nhad to create three new stories from\nscratch after perfectly resolving it\nall at the end of the first Korra story.\nAnd that\u2019s where things started to go\nwrong.\nWhilst I wouldn\u2019t go as far as calling\nBook Two of Korra, which came out in\n2013, \u2018bad\u2019, by the exceedingly high\nstandards set by Avatar (and indeed by\nKorra\u2019s previous season) it certainly\nwasn\u2019t very impressive. In any other\ncontext it would be dismissed as a\ngeneric Saturday morning cartoon,\nreally. The plot was all over the place,\nthe villain was very one-dimensional,\nhis evil scheme was confusing,\nand the characters seemed to have\nregressed and forgotten all of their\nprevious character development.\nThe animation quality was also\nreduced, since the studio which\nworked on all of the previous episodes\nof the franchise couldn\u2019t do it at such\nshort notice. Save for two exceedingly\ngood episodes which told an \u2018origin\nstory\u2019 for a lot of the show\u2019s lore\nand myths, a lot of fans were very\ndisappointed with it all.\nThankfully, there\u2019s almost a happy\nending here. This summer, Book\nThree was released online. Not only\nwas it a massive improvement on\nBook Two, many fans seem to think\nthat Book Three represents the first\ntime Korra has been as good as Avatar.\nA new team of villains were\nintroduced who were menacing,\nbadass and yet somehow still quite\nhuman. This new team pushed our\nheroes to their limit, and seeing the\nprotagonists struggle to face them was\nan immensely satisfying experience.\nThere was no annoying romance\nsubplot like in the previous\ntwo seasons and the characters\nremembered their character\ndevelopment whilst staying true to\nwhat makes them unique, plus the\nanimation and action scenes were\neasily some of the best the entire\nfranchise has seen.\nIt was also pleasing to see that not\neverything was neatly resolved at the\nend and, in a great finale, the last shot\nmakes it clear that things are open\nended, and there\u2019s still a lot of loose\nplot threads. In short, Book Three is\nwhere the show finally lived up to its\nname and became legendary.\nWhat\u2019s next for Korra? In a surprise\nmove a month ago, the creators\nannounced that the final book would\nbegin on the 3rd of October, so it\u2019s\nout now! That does, sadly, mean that\nKorra, and probably the whole Avatar\nfranchise, will be ending this year.\nAfter the drama it took to get Korra\nreleased I doubt that Nickelodeon will\ngo for a third show in this franchise\n\u2013 though in-universe comics will\nprobably continue to be published.\nThis time next year both shows will\nprobably be on Netflix, so one will be\nable to watch all 113 episodes back-to-back. In some ways I envy those\npeople, not having to go through the\ndrama and the waiting. Then again,\nit\u2019s been a pleasure to experience it\npiece by piece as part of a wonderful\nfandom. But I haven\u2019t lost hope. I still\nbelieve that somehow a new Avatar\nshow will come to save the franchise.\n\n"

This\nevent (open to the public, yay!) sees\nclothing stores in the major shopping\nareas of the city open until late, serve\nup cocktails, host DJ sets and even\noffer discounts. Of course, these\nefforts are in an attempt to entice\nshoppers to spend their money, but\nas part of the evening\u2019s events, I was\nlucky enough to attend a Q&A session\nwith British-Turkish fashion designer\nErdem.\nThe talk, chaired by British Vogue\nDeputy Editor Emily Sheffield, gave a\nfashion-industry outsider the chance\nto learn about what the industry is\nreally like, and just how high pressure\nit can be.\nSet in the Everyman Cinema on\nthe Lower Ground floor of Selfridges,\nthe session felt intimate and relaxed,\nbut the glasses of champagne served\nup were there to remind you that\nthis was an exclusive affair. After a\nvideo of Erdem\u2019s Spring/Summer\n2015 collection was shown, the man\nhimself finally came in and sat down\nwith Emily Sheffield.\nEmily began by asking Erdem\nwhere he got his inspiration for the\nsummer collection. The collection, a\ncombination of loose, flowing dresses,\nwas inspired by botany and Erdem\u2019s\nvisits to Kew Gardens. He explained\nthat when he plans a collection, he\nthinks of a narrative and draws out a\nstory whilst asking himself \u201cwhere is\nthe woman I\u2019m dressing going?\u201d\nIn every runway show, only a\nhandful of looks from the collection\nare actually shown to the audience,\nand the decisions of what to show\non the runway take place right up\nuntil the last minute. These decisions\nhave to take into account many\nconsiderations; such as making\nsure the runway show is cohesive\nwhilst also showcasing pieces that\nwill appeal to buyer\u2019s for large\ndepartment stores.\nAs if the creative process\ncouldn\u2019t be more complicated, the\nconstruction of the garments has its\nown set of challenges. Materials and\ntextiles are sourced from Italy and\nFrance, and these usually close shop\nfor the month of August, making\nSeptember a very busy month for the\ndesign team. When it comes to the\nfashion week runway show, models\noften fly in a night or two before, so\nfitting them into their runway outfits\nis a last minute job. Erdem pointed\nout that for his Summer 2015 show,\nthe last model fitting took place at\n2am on the morning of the show!\nAlthough last minute changes and\ntight deadlines are de rigueur in the\nfashion world, one can\u2019t help but\nwonder how a designer can unwind\nand take a break from the stress!\nFor Erdem, a big glass of wine right\nbefore the show works wonders for\nhis nerves.\nErdem highlights that the buyers,\nthose that decide what pieces to\nretail in stores, are a big part of\nFashion Week. They are the ones that\nwill ultimately drive business and\nexposure for designers. The buying\nprocess is mathematical, and buyer\u2019s\ntake into consideration many factors:\nhow wearable the pieces are, how\nmuch was sold last season and if the\ncollection fits their target customer.\nHe notes that buyer\u2019s decisions differ\nacross the world, because after all, a\nwoman living in LA shops differently\nto a Parisian shopping at Collette!\nWhen asked to define the woman\nhe designs for, he responds with \u201cshe\ndoesn\u2019t follow trends!\u201d He designs for\na woman who owns what she wears,\nan individual and intelligent woman.\n\u201c The woman I design for marches\nto her own drum\u201d he said. With an\nimpressive 160 stockists worldwide,\nErdem\u2019s brand is growing rapidly.\nHis first flagship store will soon be\nopening on Mayfair\u2019s South Audley\nstreet. As a successful designer with\ngrowing traction, Erdem belongs\nto the burgeoning group of young\nLondon designers in their 20\u2019s and\n30\u2019s, taking the fashion world by\nstorm. He says that ten years ago,\nfewer international buyer\u2019s attended\nLondon Fashion Week, but now\nthat\u2019s changed.\n\n"

Photo: Imperial College\nCollege has slashed the Amenity\nfunds available to Halls of\nResidence by a quarter of\na million pounds, sparking fury\namongst Hall Wardens and Seniors.\nThe amount allocated to all halls\nthis year was just over \u00a3150,000,\ndown from approximately \u00a3373,000\nin previous years. From this\n\u00a3150,000, around \u00a342,000 comes\nfrom the Education Office, whilst\nthe rest has been derived from the\nrents students are paying to live in\nhalls, approximately \u00a31 per week per\nstudent.\nThe reasoning behind the cuts\naccording to Imperial College was to\n\u201cput money back into the pockets of\nstudents\u201d and that rent prices will not\nhave risen as highly as a result.\nHowever, at time of print, the\nexact rent figures have still not been\nreleased to Felix so we cannot verify\nif this is the case.\nIt has been suggested by those\naffected that the money has gone\n\u201cback into the pockets of commercial\nservices\u201d, although this is not certain.\nThe cuts have lead to a reduction\nof \u00a3220,000 in the funds available to\nall the Halls to cover for events and\npastoral care provisions.\nThe decrease in Amenities Funds\nhas resulted in a knock on effect for\nboth the Freshers\u2019 Events and the\nprovisions for Hall Seniors, who\nmoved in a week before the new\nintake in September. There was less\nfunding available for Hall Senior\ntraining, and nor was there allegedly\nenough money available for welfare\nprovisions which are usually paid for\nusing this fund.\nHall seniors have also come forward\nto say that because events can no\nlonger be as heavily subsidised,\nticket prices have to increase as a\nresult and may deter students with\nless disposable income in getting\ninvolved.\nOne senior said \u201cEssentially a\n50%cut in your budget has exactly\nthe effect you'd imagine. Either we\nhalve the number of your events or\nreduce the quality of them.\u201d\n\u201cThis Freshers\u2019 Fortnight we've\nhad to strike a balance between the\ntwo; we\u2019ve reduced the budgets for\nparty nights and had to host more\n\u2018film nights\u2019 in the common room\nto replace events we can no longer\nafford to run.\u201d\nAnother Hall Senior says \u201cWe've\nmanaged to keep our calendar for\nFreshers\u2019 Fortnight intact but it\nwill come with a reduction in future\nevents; nights like Halloween are\nhighly unlikely to have parties now.\u201d\nIt is not just events that are\nsuffering from the cuts. One Hall\nSenior told us how they usually could\nafford to produce and print a help\nmanual for students using the funds,\nbut this had to be cut because of the\nlack of funds. \u201cIt is the Freshers that\nare missing out.\u201d\nOne Assistant Warden told us, \u201cWe\nhave had to cut back events such\nas trips to London Eye or London\nTours. Such trips are more expensive,\nbut aren\u2019t alcohol related so aren\u2019t\nparticularly exclusionary. Not all\nevents halls do are actually about\nalcohol, although it seems that\nCollege has this impression that\nalcohol is all that halls spend their\nmoney on.\u201d\n\u201cThese cuts mean not being able to\nput on the events we usually provide,\nwhich arguably detracts from the\nstudent experience.\u201d\n\u201cCampus services should not exist\nto make money out of students.\u201d\nThe Warden Discretionary Fund\nhas also been cut down to \u00a3200 per\nHall. This cost was previously used\nfor pastoral costs, such as \u201cwelfare\ncards\u201d, that provide essential welfare\ncontacts on them and before now\nwere given to all students. This year\nthe College no longer supplied these,\nso some Halls had to use the Warden\nDiscretionary fund to pay for these\ninstead in.\nHall senior motivation has also\ndropped as a result. Said one source,\n\u201cThere were no funding for team\nbuilding and training during the\nweek before the students moved in,\nand it has lead to a drop in morale.\u201d\n\u201cThe litmus test will be to see who\nstill wants to be a Hall Senior next\nyear.\u201d\nIn some Halls, Wardens themselves\nhave been reportedly known to cover\nthe costs of such provisions, although\nthis is beyond their remit and\nresponsibility.\nThe decision to cut the funding was\nmade as a response to the Residential\nExperience Review, undertaken\nearlier this year. The Review,\nconducted by senior members of staff\nin College, along with the then Union\nPresident David Goldsmith and\nDeputy President (Welfare) Marissa\nLewis, also scrutinised the Wardening\nsystem, residential staffing and the\nCollege services.\nThe Residential Experience Review\nthen produced recommendations for\nchanges, which were then discussed\nwith various other college staff\nmembers and the Sabbatical team.\nRecommendations for the fund\nincluded that it be reduced to a flat\nrate of \u00a31 per student per week,\nand that: \u201cIt should not be used to\nsubsidise high cost trips or events,\nbut should focus on activities that\u2026\nshould include a high proportion\nof activities without alcohol.\u201d The\nthen Union President and Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) successfully\nappealed for this to be increased to\n\u00a31.50 to the panel conducting the\nReview.\nThe Amenities fund was in previous\nyears taken from the rent paid by\nstudents, at a rate determined by\nHalls based the rent they paid the\nhalls they lived in and the type of\nroom they had.\nHowever, Senior College sources\nwere unable to pinpoint exactly how\nmoney was allocated per Hall before\nnow. Said one source,:\u201cKnowledge of\nhow the funds worked had been lost\nat some point.\u201d\nIt was because of this uncertainty,\nand in a bid to aid transparency, that\nthe decision was made to put the cost\nof the fund at a flat rate of \u00a31.50 per\nperson per week.\nThe reduction in funds has\nbeen coupled with some benefits.\nFinancial control of the funds has\nbeen transferred to elected Hall\nCommittees, who are then able to\nclaim back VAT on any expenditure.\nThe financial system that the Union\nruns, eActivities, has also been\nheralded as easier to use compared\nto the previous College-based system\nthe amenities fund was previousily\nmanaged by.\nDeputy President (Welfare) Chris\nKaye said: \u201cReviewing this is a top\npriority and the Union looks forward\nto working constructively with\nCollege on this issue.\u201d\n\n"

To most\npeople, they\u2019d probably just pitch in a\nconsiderate, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything\nwill be all right!\u201d before slowly\nbacking away.\nUnfortunately, despite the best\nintentions, that is not very helpful.\nIt\u2019s like saying \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll stop\nhurting soon,\u2019 to someone with a cut\non their arm.\nRemember that even if we can deal\nwith the blues every now and then,\nthis is not the same for people who\nsometimes cannot control what they\nfeel.\nSo that\u2019s why I decided to write this\narticle to help the good-intentioned\nhelp their friends when they need it\nmost.\nIn all the peer support training I\u2019ve\nbeen to, we learn that the best way to\nhelp is to listen and understand what\nthey feel. It\u2019s not a matter of trying\nto solve problems because sometimes\nthey can feel too big to be solved\nor they might not know what the\nproblem is. So to listen and letting\nthem know that you\u2019re there to listen\nis already a huge relief.\nThere remains a daunting task of\nhow to talk, or even approach, friends\ngoing through a phase however. So\nhere are some tips I\u2019ve gathered from\nmy peer support training, hoping\nthat they will be useful to some kind\nsouls out there.\nTry not to judge\nEmphasis on try. We\u2019re human\nbeings after all and we often judge\nthings surrounding us. But when\nyour friend is going through a phase,\nactively judging them for what they\nare then, rather than what they\ngenerally are, can really make things\nworse. It\u2019s already bad enough to\ninvoluntarily go through phases or\nthink in ways that disrupts their daily\nlife.\nInstead, try to make them feel that\nyou want to understand them for\nwhat they are without judging them.\nBy doing this, you will make them\nmore open to you and therefore\nmore willing to accept your help.\nOtherwise, they will just shut you off,\nthinking that you will hurt them with\nyour judgements.\nAsk open questions\nWhen your friend is going through\na tough time in his or her head\nand you ask questions that can be\nanswered with a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019, you\u2019ll\nmost likely get just that, leaving you\nhanging in awkward silence. Being\nconversational and following the\nrules of social etiquette won\u2019t be high\non their list of priorities so you\u2019ll\noften have to allow room for them\nto talk by asking broad questions.\nAn example would be \u201cYou didn\u2019t\nseem to enjoy yourself at the dinner.\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nAlso these questions will help\nyour friend articulate their jumbled\nthoughts, which you can help\norganise by asking more questions.\nBut at the same time, avoid\n'why' questions\nThis one sounds silly, but a scenario\nwould demonstrate this best. Say,\nyou\u2019re having a bad day. Your\nfavourite football team fell out of the\nleague, your group meeting ended up\nin a shouting contest and you\u2019ve just\nlost five games of Starcraft in a row.\nThen your flatmate came in, noticed\nyour gloomy expression and asked,\n\u201cWhy so gloomy, man?\u201d When you\nanswered, he decided to play detective\nwith another question, \u201cWhy do you\neven let them bother you?\u201d\nQuestions starting with \u2018why\u2019\nalways have a judgement attached to\nthem.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat that?\u201d \u201c Why do\nyou hate her so much?\u201d \u201cWhy are you\nalways so sensitive?\u201d\nWhen faced with questions that\nimply that they\u2019re not normal or\naccepted, people with disorders\nwould tend to withdraw from the\nconversation since they feel that they\nwon\u2019t be understood.\nSo what do we ask? Instead of using\n\u2018why\u2019, try rephrasing the question in\na different way that still show that\nyou want to understand how they\nfeel. For example, instead of \u201cWhy do\nyou hate her so much?\u2019, say \u2018What is\nit that you don\u2019t like about her?\u2019. In\nthe same way, \u2018Why are you always\nso sensitive?\u2019 can be phrased as \u2018What\nmakes you feel this way?\u2019\nSummarise things for them\nTrust me, there is nothing more\nreassuring for someone who often\nfeels isolated by their condition than\nto be given an accurate summary of\nwhat they are feeling. It\u2019s the best way\nto show your friend that you truly\nunderstand them and hearing an echo\nof the feelings they\u2019ve articulated is\nan amazing relief.\nSome people might be reluctant to\nsummarise because they are scared\nthey will get it wrong and make\nthings worse. But that\u2019s not true. If\nyou are mistaken about anything,\nyou will likely be corrected and end\nup with up with a more complete\nunderstanding of your friend\u2019s\nsituation.\nEveryone is different\nA tip you hear all the time, but\nworth mentioning. When someone\nwho is suffering from depression\nor anxiety said they want to be left\nalone, it can either mean they want\nto be avoided until the phase blows\nover or it can equally be a subtle cry\nfor help. This differs from person to\nperson, condition to condition, so do\nadjust to what your friends are like.\nTry to find out what they truly want\nwith open questions about how they\nfeel and also show that you are willing\nto talk. But bear in mind that if all\nyour efforts are brushed away, it\u2019s not\nyour fault. They might just prefer to\nbe left alone.\nTo sum up, I want to point out\nthat I\u2019m aware I used the word\n\u2018phases\u2019 a lot throughout this\narticle. And that\u2019s to make it very\nclear that a mental illness is not what\ndefines the person suffering from\nit. It\u2019s a state, it\u2019s an interference, a\ndisruption to daily life. So please bear\nwith people who go through it from\ntime to time. They will be incredibly\ngrateful for your efforts amidst\nthe world full of stigma on mental\nillnesses. And I hope that you will\nfind some tips here useful!\nOh and of course, these tips can also\nuseful and can be applied to anyone!\nEMILY CRAMPHORN\n68,044 Pledge to end the stigma of mental illness\nOctober is a month marked by\nprominent health awareness\ncampaigns from Breast\nCancer Awareness to Stoptober.\nHowever, October is also marked\nby a less prominent but equally\nimportant campaign to raise\nawareness for mental health.\nMental illness affects one in four\npeople nevertheless those who suffer\nface stigma and discrimination.\nMany people have negative and\npreconceived beliefs about mental\nillness.

Before\nthis eventful occurrence, I was an\nApprentice virgin (I know, shocking),\nbut here is what my extensive\nwatching of the show has taught me.\nWhereas most reality TV relies\non archetypal characters to stir up\ndrama, this programme is more of\na social experiment What happens\nwhen you make twenty identical,\nmoney-driven, Lord Sugar wannabes\ninteract?\nAfter waking the contestants\nup at 05 00 to reach Imperial\nCollege London \u2013 obviously not\nunderstanding that early rises\ngo against the official student\nphilosophy \u2013 Lord Sugar sets them\na task inspired by our institution\u2019s\nscientific reputation To design\na fashionable item of wearable\ntechnology. Fashion at Imperial?\nWell, I guess we do wear clothes.\nAt this point the contestants, very\noriginally divided into boys and\ngirls, run off in a panic to create this\nincredible garment.\nAnd thus ended the College\u2019s fifteen\nminutes of fame, as the planning\nis not done here but in a swanky\noffice that you are made to believe\nis on the top floor of some amazing\nCity skyscraper, but is probably\nin a basement in Haggerston with\npanoramas of London sellotaped to\nthe windows.\nIt is in this office that the teams\ncome up their items essentially a\ngrey sweater and an M&S jacket,\nwith lights and buttons. This may\nseem easy to us technologically-gifted nerds, but considering that\nthe women are unaware of the\nimportance of exposing solar panels\nto the actual sun, the results are\nimpressive.\nOn their side, the men create a\nslightly creepy Big Brother sweater\nwith a hidden camera to sneakily\nrecord friends and family in\ncompromising positions and flashy\nChristmas tree inspired decorations.\nNone of the possible buyers seem\ninterested in the products (despite the\nwomen\u2019s extensive market research\nbased on a sample size of one) and one\nof the men actually admits he would\nnever wear his own creation in public.\nSo let me set the scene; I\u2019m sitting\non my couch, with a few friends\nand a healthy supply of wine at\nmy side.\nAs the weeks have progressed we\u2019ve\nall become more and more addicted\nto the pastel-coloured, innuendo-ridden spectacle that is Great British\nBake Off.\nAnd here it is; the grand finale!\nHowever, despite the high degree\nof anticipation in the air, as the last\nepisode progresses all I can think is\nThen Lord Sugar is forced to pick\nsomeone to fire, something that\nevidently still fills him with immense\npleasure after all these years. He picks\nWanker 1 and Wanker 2 (no, I don\u2019t\nremember their names).\nAll in all some pretty unsatisfying\nwatching but, hey, did you see how\nshiny we looked on TV?\n\u201cmeh...\u201d\nThis year, Paul and Mary decided to\ntest the finalists on their core baking\nskills.\nFirst off was a Danish pastry\nchallenge which saw the contestants\nexperiment with various flavour\ncombinations including raspberry\nand chocolate, pear and chocolate,\nand apple and lemon.\nNo, we weren\u2019t that inspired either.\nThe only exception was Manchesterbased Spaniard Luis, who tried to\nraise the bar with his cheese and\napple pastries. And despite Paul\u2019s\njudgemental gaze, I would have\nhappily given them a bite.\nThe technical bake was an even\nless exciting combination of three\nbaking staples. Despite the time\npressure (three bakes in three hours)\nand the ever-looming threat of a\nsoggy bottom, there is really nothing\nthat can make watching a scone rise\nriveting; even without getting raisins,\nthe most disgusting food known to\nman, involved.\nThe showstopper challenge was\nsupposed to be a grand and festive\npi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e, a massive edible\ncentrepiece of choux pastries, biscuits,\nmacaroons and cakes.\nThis grandiose concept somehow\ninspired two contestants to go back to\ntheir roots and pay homage to their\nhometowns.\nContestant Nancy \u2013 who evidently\ndidn\u2019t think her birthplace, Hull, was\nsufficiently exciting \u2013 followed the\nFrench theme and opted to fashion a\nsugar sculpture of the Moulin Rouge.\nThis made her creation essentially\nan edible brothel; which wouldn\u2019t\nhave been my first choice.\nAs all good things must come to an\nend, the winner had to be announced.\nBeloved builder Richard was the\nfavourite, having achieved star-baker\nstatus on a record five occasions.\nHowever you can\u2019t win Bake Off\nwith a runny jam, and by the end of\nthe episode his chances seemed pretty\nlow. So maybe Luis? Thanks to his\nextraordinary graphic design skills,\nshown from day one, most people\nexpected him to pull this one of.\nAnd they were all wrong! Because \u2013\nspoiler alert \u2013 it was Nancy, Queen of\nthe Backcombed Barnet, who actually\ntook home the prize.\nAdmittedly we were all a bit\ndisappointed, especially as the\nhusband of the winner joked \u201cI had\nno doubt she would win, she always\ngets what she wants\u201d. Great, a real\nunderdog. I guess we will patiently\nhave to wait for 2015 to satisfy our\nnew cake cravings\u2026\n\n"

Known for playing\nslightly unhinged, potentially\ndangerous women on the verge\nof having a complete meltdown,\nGreen is spot-on in any role that\nrequires her to be dark and disturbed.\nWhether portrayed as a villain or a\nvictim, the fundamental common\ntheme that runs through most, if not\nall, her characters, is that you should\nprepare yourself for a captivating\nturn.\nHere, Green plays a mother who\nmysteriously disappears without a\ntrace. Her daughter Kat (Shailene\nWoodley) takes centre stage in trying\nto piece together just what the hell\nhappened. She reflects on the past,\none that includes many instances of\nher mother\u2019s erratic behaviour.\nBrock (Christopher Meloni) and\nEve (Green) Connor were supposed\nto live out the perfect little suburban\nAmerican dream. And to give them\nsome credit, their early years were\nblessed with happy memories. This\nis until Eve realises the repetitive,\nfrustrating nature of her existence\nas a bored housewife who is only\nconcerned with keeping the house\ntidy. With very little sex in the\nmarriage, Brock turns to magazines\nand Eve turns to her daughter\u2019s\nboyfriend.\nYes, Kat, having reached that\ncertain age, starts seeing her\nneighbour Phil (Shiloh Fernandez)\nthe-boy-next-door-type who also\ntakes an interest in her. Their\nintensely sexual relationship catches\nthe envy and bitter disdain of Eve\nwho stares as Eva Green does best;\nwith her no-nonsense, piercing gaze\nthat sends chills down spines. This\nis the turning point for Eve. She\nstarts dressing more provocatively,\nspeaking more resentfully towards\nher husband and daughter and she\nbegins to drink more, much to the\nshock and annoyance of her family\nmembers.\nIt is in the midst of this madness\nKat has her growing-up to do. White\nBird in a Blizzard is a coming-of-age\nstory of Kat. A police investigation\ngets underway, although it is difficult\nto pin-point exactly what happened.\nWas Eve taken against her will or\nhas she done her absolute best to get\naway from her monotonous life?\nAfter some digging, there is very\nlittle evidence to support whatever\ntheory anyone might have about\nit, so gradually, Eve becomes a\nforgotten figure. The only thing that\ncomes from the police intervening is\nDetective Scieziesciez (Thomas Jane)\nwho lets himself be seduced by Kat\nthen proceeds to satisfy her voracious\nsexual appetite.\nWoodley is conquering all sorts\nof genres to add to her impressive\nresume; she can tick the box titled\n\u2018twisted little indie\u2019, proving she\nreally can do pretty much anything\nthat is required of her. Despite there\nbeing an age gap of only 12 years\nbetween them, Green and Woodley\nhave a fascinating chemistry. They\ncan be seen as competitors when it\ncomes to their search for love and\nsex, and when Green exerts her\nmaternal pressures and powers on\nher pubescent daughter, the tension\nbetween the two escalates even more.\nGreen, as mentioned before, is\na force to be reckoned with. Her\nperformance is most effective when\nshe is using her English accent, as\nher American one has a hint of\nan awkward twinge in there, but\nit does not stop her from giving\nyet another emotionally draining,\ncompletely gripping, unpredictable\nturn. Eve\u2019s slow descent into madness\nis undeniably entertaining because\nGreen does it so well, but at the same\ntime heart-breaking, because the\ntwo sufferers, Brock and Kat, must\ndeal with the consequences of such\nbehaviour.\nThe story moves on with Kat going\non to college, making new friends and\na new boyfriend, but the past comes\nback to haunt her when she returns\nhome. Now the loose ends must be\ntied up and the questions answered.\nAnd with not too many realistic\nsuspects involved, it does not become\na tricky game of whodunnit. Kat is\nalmost too blind to see something\nthat is quite apparent from what is\nleft behind. But the way the final\nscene unfolds sends the feeling\nthat the film is trying too hard to\nbe unpredictable. There is such a\nsudden change in the way some of\nthe characters are portrayed that the\nfinal twist becomes too implausible.\nIt rushes through its ending with the\njaw-drop finale, not quite thinking\nthrough the fact that the characters\nwe have known throughout the film\u2019s\nrunning time do not quite match up\nwith what we see in the ending. There\nare ways to do a smart, unexpected\nending, the way White Bird in a\nBlizzard goes about achieving that is\nnot quite the most effective.\nTeenagers are big business. Due\nto the success of franchises\nlike Harry Potter, Twilight\nand the Hunger Games, production\ncompanies are desperate to find the\nnext big hit to empty teens\u2019 wallets,\nand to be the ones that do it first.\nThis has led to a spate of second-rate\nfilms that haven\u2019t quite made the cut.\nLook at the Golden Compass, Mortal\nInstruments, I Am Number Four or\nStormbreaker. All of these took books\nwith large fan bases, enjoyable plots,\ntwists, turns, and lots of sequels, and\nin making them into a film, managed\nto take away what made them good\nin the first place. It\u2019s easy to make a\nfilm. What is much more difficult\nis to make the franchise, and that is\nwhere these films fail. Not a single\none in that list did well enough to get\na sequel.\nThe Maze Runner, based on the\nbestseller by James Dashner, is the\nlatest of these attempts. And finally,\nfor what is the first time since\nperhaps the Hunger Games, it has\nsucceeded.\nImagine you wake up in a strange\nplace, surrounded by people you\ndon\u2019t know and you can\u2019t remember\nanything, not even your own name.\nThen you might have an idea how\nour protagonist feels at the start of\nthe Maze Runner. So what do you do\nsurrounded by all this? The film title\nmay give you a bit of a hint. You run.\nThe film starts some pretty speedy\nexposition after this. The strange\nplace our characters are in is called\nthe Glade. It looks like a fairly idyllic\nplace, apart from the fact that it is\nsurrounded by immensely tall walls.\nThe people are known as Gladers, and\nthey live by three rules. Everyone\ndoes their part. Never hurt another\nGlader. Never go outside the Glade.\nThe reason for the last rule? The\nGlade is surrounded by a maze which\nchanges layout every night. Every\nday Runners go out into the Maze to\nmap it and try and find a way out. But\nonly the strongest and fastest of the\nGladers can to do this, as at sundown\nthe doors to the Maze shut, and\nno-one has ever survived a night in\nthe maze before. There are monsters\nin the Maze, known as Grievers. But\nof course, no-one has even seen a\nGriever either.\nThe leader of the Glade, Alby,\ntakes our main character under his\nwing, and after a convenient blow\nto the head, he remembers his name\nas Thomas. But almost as soon\nas Thomas starts to feel at home,\nthings start going wrong. A Glader is\nattacked by the Grievers during the\nday, sending him into a craze where\nhe tries to kill Thomas.\nAt this point the plot, which had\nbeen very exposition heavy, starts\nto pick up pace. Mazes are explored,\nmonsters are battled, and lots of\npeople fight about lots of things.\nOne of the major things that can\nmake these type of films sink or swim\nis the acting from the understandably\nyoung cast. The Hunger Games has an\nAcademy Award winning actress in\nthe lead role. The Mortal Instruments\n\u2013 not so much. Many teen franchises\ntry to counter this by having well\nrespected actors in the adult roles\n(think Kate Winslet in Divergent or\npretty much any of the Professors\nin Harry Potter). However as almost\nall the characters in the Maze Runner\nare young males, this film cannot use\nthis to distract from potentially poor\nperfromances.\nThankfully the Maze Runner\nmanages to avoid this problem. In\nthe main role is Dylan O\u2019Brien, in\nhis first major film role since he rose\nto fame in TV\u2019s Teen Wolf. He is very\ngood at managing to balance between\nscared and confused teen to bold and\nconfident Runner with ease.\nThe best performances of the films\nhowever, belong to Thomas BrodieSangster and Will Poulter as Newt\nand Gally. Though they could easily\ncome across as the generic \u2018Good\nGuy\u2019 and \u2018Bad Guy\u2019 respectively, they\nbring heart to their roles, especially\nPoulter in the climax of the film,\nproving what he has only hinted at\nbefore \u2013 he has the ability to go far in\nthe acting career.\nThe look of the film is another\npoint in its favour; though the\nGreivers are a little silly in concept,\nthey still manage to be the correct\nlevel of scary. The bright greens and\nblues of the Glade are juxtoposed with\nthe dank greys of the Maze, helping\nto creat very different moods in each\nspace.\nOverall, though it suffers from a\nslow start, the Maze Runner builds\nand builds to a fantastic conclusion,\nmanaging to surprise from what\ncould easily be predicatable.\nIt\u2019s helped by some excellent\nperformances from the core cast.\nIt\u2019s great to finally see the\nbeginning of what could be the next\nbig franchise. All there is to do is\nwait, and hope that the sequel is just\nas good.\nDirector: Wes Ball\nScreenplay: Noah Oppenheim,\nGrant Pierce Myers\nCast: Dylan O\u2019Brien, Kaya\nScoldelario, Will Poulter\nDirector: Gregg Araki\nScreenplay: Gregg Araki\nCast: Shailene Woodley, Eva\nGreen, Christopher Meloni,\nShiloh Fernandez\nEllen Mathieson gets lost in Maze Runner\nRun, baby, run\n\n"

Habib\nstarts us off \u2013 the atmosphere is easy\nas Habib\u2019s confidence and boisterous\nlaugh puts us all at ease.\nA seasoned black belt, he\u2019s been\nteaching Krav for seven years now and\nfighting even longer than that.\nKrav is nothing like most oriental\nmartial arts because they were all\ndeveloped in the middle ages. Since\nKrav is still being developed today,\nit is effective for modern combat,\nactually adapting techniques for\nuse in modern-day situations. It\nresembles most closely the Keysi\nfighting style, which Christian Bale\ndemonstrates in Nolan\u2019s adaptations\nof Batman.\n\u201cI suppose the most similar would\nbe Mixed Marshal Arts, but that\u2019s all\nunarmed combat. In Krav, we defend\nagainst all sorts of weapons \u2013 knives,\nguns, batons, etc., and also against\nmultiple armed opponents.\u201d\nWe warm up before moving onto\nwhat the spirit of Krav is all about\n\u2013 moving into the opponent and\ngetting up close for the counterattack.\nWe only get about fifteen minutes of\nthis \u2018traditional\u2019 martial arts training,\nhowever, because Krav is all about\nreal life situations and how to get\nthrough a fight and survive.\nHabib sets up a deadly obstacle\ncourse where the obstacles are\nopponents attacking with knives,\nbatons, grapples, and kicks \u2013 none\nof which we were taught at the\nbeginning. Leaving only half a\nsecond between opponents means\nthat getting trained this way hones\nyour survival instinct and the core\nprinciple of getting inside your\nopponent\u2019s guard to take him down\nwith the counterattack. This, it\nturns out, succeeds very well when\ndefending yourself against all of these\nsituations.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have twenty years\nto learn every single move and\ncountermove,\u201d Habib reminds us.\n\u201cMost fights are going to be even\nshorter than this; five seconds is too\nlong and in real life you\u2019re looking\nat two.\u201d\nOver the remaining ninety or so\nminutes Habib sets up a fake social\nsituation, where half of us are the\naway victors at a football match and\nthe other half are the angry home\nsupporters.\nUnbeknownst to us, our rivals are\narmed and so after mingling a bit\none of them suddenly pulls a gun on\nme. My pitiful reaction of trying to\nslap his hand away and stammering\n\u201cwoah, woah, Jesus Christ\u201d doesn\u2019t\nreally do much to save me in that\nsituation.\nHabib then explains that these are\nthe situations that you find yourself\nin in real life \u2013 these are where your\nfights are going to be, not honourable\nkarate tournaments or an initiation\ninvolving a convenient matchup\nagainst another Wing Chun expert\nbalancing on tables.\nWe learn to read a little body\nlanguage and also perform basic\nchecks to see if anyone is hiding any\nweapons somewhere. The role-play\ngets a little more intense and this\ntime there is name-calling and\ngeneral provocation before any\nweapons were drawn.\nUnfortunately for my new attacker,\nwho also pulls a gun on me, he failed\nto notice that this time I had been\narmed with a knife and that I am\nsurrounded by \u2018friends\u2019 this time.\nThe result is my companions\ndragging the gun out of his hand and\nhim to the floor whilst I stab him in\nthe neck, all within one second of the\nwhole incident taking place.\nHabib demonstrates a knife block on an 'attacker'.

Photo: Creative Commons\nWrite for Clubs & Societies\nAre you a club or society president? Have you started doing something new this year? Do you want the chance to show off a new skill? Do you really like writing experience pieces?\nIf the answer to any of those questions is\u201cyes\u201d,then you're in luck! We are looking for regular and occasional writers about anything Club & Society related-this could be event\nreviews,trip reports,big (or little) wins or even shameless plugs about a new activity.All you need is access to a computer and something to write about.\nIf interested,drop us a line at felix@imperial.ac.ukwith the subject line\u201cC&S Article\u201d.\nHabib is happy to take questions\nthroughout and demonstrates a\nvariety of finger and wrist breaks,\ndisarms, and elbow and knee strikes\nhe promises to teach us next time.\nKrav is a viciously pragmatic\nmartial art and Habib channels this\nby touching on the philosophical\naspects of hurting others as well as\ntrying to save people you care about,\nas well as the importance of common\nsense.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a hero; you can walk away\nand nobody will judge you for it.\u201d\nAny martial arts fan or anyone\nwho is up for learning a bit of street\ndefence should definitely drop by to\na session, and witness the unique and\ndeadly Krav Maga fighting style for\nthemselves.\n\"Don't be a\nhero; you\ncan walk\naway\"\n\n"

The off-season had seen\nfantastic recruitment, particularly\nin the pitching department and this\nteam represented the best chance yet\nthat the Falcons had of securing that\nvaunted Fall Cup Shield which they\nlast won in 2010.\nThings were looking a little shaky in\nthe warm up drills, but thankfully the\nFalcons found their groove for the\nfirst game against Southampton. The\nteam as a whole was the beneficiary\nof some erratic pitching from our\nopponents, and patient battings led\nto 8 walks and 1 free base due to a\nhit batter. This allowed the Falcons\nto pile on the runs with a total of 16\nscoring on 7 hits thanks to Ashley,\nZack, Yuki, Patrick, Vincent, Ben and\nMin. Chris did well to hit a strong\nline drive to right field that was\nsomewhat magically scooped up by\nSouthampton\u2019s right fielder inches\nfrom the ground.\nOn the defensive side, the Falcons\nwere impeccable with a perfect 1.00\nfielding percentage. Pitchers Yuki\nFujita and Zack Wang combined\nto shutout the Mustangs and gain\nthe win for the Falcons in the first\ngame. With a +16 run differential, the\nFalcons were now at the top of the\ntable for the first time in 4 years.\nThe next game against the UCLU\nCapitals was a much closer affair as\nFalcon bats went strangely silent\nwith only 4 hits the entire game.\nNevertheless, the Falcon\u2019s fielding\nand pitching pulled through again\nwith another fantastic performance\nby Zack Wang on the mound striking\nout 3 batters and allowing only 2\nruns in the first 4 innings before\ncloser Eduardo came in to finish the\nlast inning with 3 easy outs despite 2\ninconsequential walks. The Falcons\nagain showed their mettle on the\nfield with yet another 1.00 showing\non the field, securing the win 8-2\ndespite mustering less hits than their\nopponents.\nThe third game started off a very\ntight affair, With the Falcons first\nup to bat, leadoff Ashley and second\nbatter Eduardo both grounded out\nto the left side of the field. Third\nbaseman Patrick stepped up and was\nlucky to get on base from an error by\nthe Thieves\u2019 first baseman. A stolen\nbase later, he was in scoring position\nand left-fielder Yuki smashed in a\ndouble to bring him home before\nZack grounded out to first base. With\nthe score at 1-0, pitcher Eduardo,\ngave a fantastic showing on the\nmound, gaining a 1-2-3 inning with\n2 strikeouts to bring the Falcons\nback to bat. Things started off well\nfor the Falcons with first baseman\nBen hitting a triple to get in scoring\nposition. Catcher Vincent Li then\ngrounded out to the pitcher, giving\nthe Thieves their first out. Then,\nin a squeeze play right out of the\nhighlight reel, Second baseman Rhys\nJones laid down a perfect bunt to\nscore Ben and made it to first. The\nscore was now 2-0 with the Falcons\nin the lead. However, right field\nJacques would then strike out to give\nthe Thieves their second out. Leadoff\nAshley stepped up to the plate again\nand started off a 2-out rally with a\nbig double behind centre field which\nwas followed by hits from second,\nthird and fourth batters which\nbrought in a further 4 runs before\nZack grounded out to first to end the\ninning. The Falcons were now 6-0\nahead and looking very strong on the\nfield. Nottingham\u2019s biggest batter\nthen stepped up in a big way with a\nsolo home run over the centerfield\nfence before Eduardo closed out an\notherwise uneventful inning against\nthe remaining batters. In the top of\nthe third, the Falcons continued to\npile on the runs with Ben, Vincent,\nChris and Ashley all coming round\nto score, bringing the Falcons to an\nunassailable 10-1 lead. The game\nwould end in two more innings with\nthe Falcons closer Zack closing out\nthe game for the save despite giving\nup 2 runs to bring the score to 11-3.\nThe final round robin game for the\nFalcons came on Sunday against last\nyear\u2019s Spring Cup champions, the\nUEA Blue Sox.\nThe chilly weather was getting to\neveryone and it was evident in the\nerratic pitching of starter Zack as\nwell as a series of uncharacteristic\nfielding errors from everyone that\nallowed UEA to score 2 runs in the\nfirst inning. Nevertheless, the Falcons\ncame back strongly to knock 7 in for\na mercy rule inning in the bottom\nof the first that was helped along\nhugely by a UEA pitcher that could\nonly manage 6 strikes for the inning\nand singles from Eduardo, Stephane\nand Ashley. The top of the second\nhowever, showed that the Falcons\nthemselves weren\u2019t immune to the\nweather as UEA knocked them right\nback for a mercy rule inning with\nZack struggling to find the strike\nzone. The Falcons then came back\nagain with a second straight mercy\nrule inning of their own, helped along\nby singles from Patrick and Min and\na massive two run line-drive homer to\nleft field from Yuki.\nThe Falcons were now up 14-9 and\nwith Zack finally finding the strike\nzone in the top of the third, they\nmanaged to get out of the inning with\nonly 3 runs scored.\nAs the bottom of the third came\nround, the Falcons were 10 minutes\nfrom securing the win on time,\nhaving batted second.\nPatient batting from all batters saw\nthe inning drag past the 10 minute\nmark as the Falcons scored one off\na wild pitch, bringing the Falcons\ninto their first final in 4 years with a\nperfect unbeaten record in the round\nrobin.\nNerves must have got to the Falcons\nin their first big game however,\nand they gave up 6 runs in the top\nASHLEY NG DING WEN\nICBC CHAIR\nSnowSports or No Sports: The Gnarliest club on campus\nFor centuries, humans have\npondered the possibility of having\nfun in Winter. We have now found\nthe answer strapping a plank of wood\nto your feet and trying to traverse\ndown a snowy hill, also known as\nSkiing and Snowboarding\u2026. and\nyour Snowsports club with the help\nof Oliver Wynam is here to help you\nexperience what many are calling the\ngreatest thing since sliced bread.\nOn Wednesday 8th of October\nICSC ventured to Milton Keynes\nto partake in the first ritual of the\nyear. Upon arriving in the ghost\ntown that is Milton Keynes ICSC\nand the London SnowOp were ready\nto rip up the slope! We were blessed\nby the gods and there was no one\nelse that evening (Yeah, we rented\nout the whole slope to ourselves). It\nwas a night filled with high speed\nand acrobatics with a slope style\nand slalom course set up just for us.\nUnfortunately the night came to an\nend but no one had to fear because we\nwill have many more awesome events\norganised this year.\nThe committee have been working\naway to plan a busy season for all you\nlovely people. To name just a few\nthings planned for you this year we\nhave BUDS (massive competition in\nEdinburgh), Kings Race series, BUISC\n(indoor inter-uni competition),\nregular racing and freestyle training\nsessions, our incredible trips in the\nChristmas and Easter Holidays and\nof course more socials than you can\nshake a ski at.\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned vet or a\nnovice curious to discover the joys of\nsnow sports and the intricacies of the\nquasi-religious subculture of snow\nworship that goes with it, we have\nsomething for you. Starting with the\nbeginners, we run lessons at Hemel\nHempstead snow dome during term\ntime before the Christmas and Easter\nholidays to get you up to speed with\nthe basics before the trip and we offer\nan excellent beginners package on\nthe trip. For those of you who have\nskied or boarded before we have\nregular racing and freestyle sessions\nthroughout the year, which are a great\nopportunity to hone your skills. Both\nracing and freestyle sessions are open\nto everyone who has any previous\nexperience on the snow (i.e. can get\ndown a slope by themselves safely), so\ndon\u2019t think you aren\u2019t good enough,\nit\u2019s a great opportunity to improve.\nThis year we are pleased to\nannounce our new partnership with\nthe management consultancy firm\nOliver Wyman. If you are interested\nin possibly pursuing a career in\nthis sector, take a look at their\nfantastic opportunities either in the\nsponsorship section of ICSC\u2019s website\nor at oliverwyman.com/careers.\nTogether we are working towards\nmaking this year one of the best in\nPhoto: ICU Snowsports\nof the first with a series of hugely\nuncharacteristic errors. From then\non, UEA never looked back as dismal\nhitting from the Falcons saw them\nonly getting on the scoreboard in the\nbottom of the third off a line-drive\nsingle from Patrick coupled with 2\nstolen bases and a wild pitch. The\nBlue Sox continued to pile on the runs\nas starter Yuki had trouble finding\nthe zone and soon the score had\nbecome 11-1 . With things looking\ngrim for the Falcons, a two out rally\nstarted again in the bottom of the\nfourth with Ashley getting on base off\na single to the opposite field before\nstealing two bases and coming home\noff a passed ball. Patrick drew the\nwalk to get on base and subsequently\ncame home on a wild pitch after two\nstolen bases.\nYuki then drew another walk and\ncame home on another wild pitch\nbefore Jacques struck out to end the\nFalcon\u2019s hopes of victory.\nDespite the dismal final, lots\nof positives were taken from the\ncompetition, with huge improvement\nfrom last year\u2019s new players, Rhys,\nStephane and Min.\nAnd as the Falcons celebrate their\nfirst trophy position in 4 years, the\nsights are set firmly on the National\nUniversity Softball Championships\non the 18th of October where the\nFalcons will be aiming to expand\ntheir trophy collection.\nICSC\u2019s history so now is definitely the\ntime to get involved.\nCheck us out on Facebook or sign\nup to the mailing list on our website\nfor more info about what is clearly\nthe best society at Imperial.\nROSS MASKE\nICU SNOWSPORTS\n\n"

Debra Humphris, Vice\nProvost (Education), launched the\nday with a short speech commenting\non the \u201ccontinued evolution of our\nsports facilities\u201d and the revealing of\na plaque honouring Teddington and\na piece of the hallowed Teddington\ngrass.\nThe planes are as close as at\nHarlington, indicating quite how far\nWest the new sports ground is.\nHowever, it took only 30 minutes\nby minibus to reach the new centre,\na large sprawling complex that backs\nonto the swathe of sports grounds.\nAlex Savell, Deputy President\n(Finance and Services), has already\nscoped the ground and thinks at least\ntwo polo pitches could fit on the site,\nsuch is the expanse.\nTeddington was also honoured by\nthe renaming of one of the bars (there\nwere three open and operational\non Wednesday) as the Teddington\nBar.

Even the Medics\nPresident, Dariush HassanzadehBaboli, managed to dig out a rugby\nshirt for a cameo seconds appearance,\nclaiming he might even play at\nVarsity.\nIC Cheerleaders were also in\nattendance as were representatives\nfrom ICU Dance who gave\ndemonstrations to College and Union\nstaff.\nThe day was rounded off by\na compelling speech from Tom\nWheeler, Union President, and Abi\nde Bruin, Deputy President (Clubs\nand Societies), extolling the virtues of\nthe new sports ground.\nTom Wheeler said, \u201cIt was fantastic\nto see sports teams using the new\nfacilities at Hestion and performance\nteams using the new space in the\ntheatre that is also on the site.\n\u201cIt is important we don\u2019t forget the\nhistory and tradition of Teddington\nand the siginificance of it\u2019s loss. We\nare looking forward to celebrating\nTeddington this weekend at the\nTeddington Alumnus Day, as are\nexcited for the future of sport at\nHeston.\u201d\n\u201cThe future of College bursaries in your hands\u201d\nTOM WHEELER\nUNION PRESIDENT\nIagree this is weird, what is\nsomeone from the Union doing\nwriting an article in Felix about\na College decision? But please keep\nreading because this really matters.\nIf you are a Home Undergraduate\nstudent and receive an Imperial\nCollege Bursary (i.e.: your household\u2019s\nincome is <\u00a360k), then I really want\nto know what you think of the\nbursary support package that College\nprovides. Remember, that this is\nonly talking about the bursary that\nCollege provides, and not the Student\nFinance one.\nAs a disclaimer, I\u2019d like to reiterate\nthat unfortunately for the majority\nof students who might be reading\nthis, that this precise discussion\nonly affects Home Undergraduate\nstudents with a household income of\n<\u00a360k. Also, please don\u2019t think that\nwe don\u2019t know that there are serious\nfinancial support issues affecting\na large number of the rest of our\nmembers; however, this funding\npackage is only targeted at Home\nUndergraduate students. Remember\nthat if you are ever in need of help\nand advice then you should ask the\nUnion\u2019s Advice Centre to find out if\nthere is money available to help you.\nI sit on a working group in College\nthat focuses on ensuring that\neveryone who is capable to study\nat Imperial, can. Imperial College\nprovides a bursary package that is\nquite a bit bigger than pretty much\nevery other University that I have\nmanaged to look into. It should, as\nSouth Kensington is (unsurprisingly)\nreally expensive, but how expensive?\nImperial College is proposing\nchanges to the distribution of the\namount given in bursaries for the\n2016/17 first years so that every\nstudent who is offered a place to study\nat Imperial can afford it. They are\nnot looking at reducing the amount it\nspends on bursaries, but distributing\nit as fairly as possible. The most\nchallenging thing that I\u2019m trying\nto figure out when looking through\nsome of the options proposed is what\nis fair? Here are some (exaggerated,\nand generally rhetorical) questions\nto show you what I\u2019m getting at (and\nby the way, I don\u2019t have an opinion/\nanswer to these).\nHow much money does a student\nneed? Is it fair to assume that\nstudents from a \u00a340k household\nare financially supported by their\nfamilies? Is it fair to assume that the\nnumber of dependents in a household\nis irrelevant when distributing\nstudent funding? Is it fair that\nstudents from a \u00a324k household\nreceive nearly twice as much as a\n\u00a340k household? Does every \u00a340k\nhousehold have the \u00a32k a year to\nbring a student up to a \u2018living wage\u2019?\nYou get the idea.\nCollege has proposed some\noptions ranging from \u201ckeep the same\nmodel\u201d through to \u201cgive everyone\nthe same amount\u201d. I have had a lot\nof conversations and meetings in\nthe last 5 days with the Sabb team,\nas well as staff and students in the\nUnion about the different options\nthat College has proposed, however\nnothing is as representative of what\nstudents want as an actual discussion\nwith students. Therefore, I\u2019m inviting\nyou all to come and find out what\noptions are proposed, ask questions,\nand give your opinion. We are\nholding a meeting in Blackett Lecture\nTheatre 1, this Thursday at 1pm. If\nyou want to get in touch, please email\nme at union.president@ic.ac.uk.\nPhoto: Oli Benton Photo: Oli Benton\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 7\n17.10.2014\nFELIX\nNews Editors Aemun Reza & Kunal Wagle\nNews\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Union held its first ever\nalcohol free club night \u2013 \u201cDri\u201d\non Monday 13th. Unlucky for\nsome; most likely the bar manager\u2019s\nprofit margins, and anyone who\nturned up.\nA full complement of security staff\nwere on hand to deal with the rowdy\nnon-crowd of non-drinkers, and with\nlime soda priced at 20p to lubricate\nthe masses, the chance of breaking\neven was always going to be slim.\nAn anonymous Union source said\n\u201cWe literally had to turn people away,\nand people kept asking if this was a\nregular thing\u201d.\nOn offer throughout the evening\nwere several giant games, a selection\nof mocktails and the kitchen was also\nopen an hour later.\nHowever, when customers found\nout they couldn\u2019t buy alcohol, \u201cthey\nliterally turned around and walked\nout.\u201d\nThe budget for this year\u2019s event was\n\u00a33000 less than a normal Monday\nnight when alcohol is available,\nalthough the Union never intended\nfor the event to make a profit in the\nfirst place. It is reassuring that the\nUnion aims high when organising\nevents however; Alex Savell, Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services), said\nthat the event was ran as \u201c not for\nprofit; we ran it as a service.\u201d\nAround one hundred people are\nthought to have attended the evening\nin total.\nThe highlight of the evening was\neasily DJ Sue, who, in fairness, spun\nout some absolute classics across\nFiveSixEight. Despite her smooth\ngrooves at one point it was \u201cliterally\nthe bar staff and the DJ.\u201d\nWith Metric empty apart from\nthose who had just served time on\nthe Union Council and FiveSixEight\npopulated by those few who live in\nBeit and can\u2019t cook for themselves,\nthe atmosphere allegedly \u201cleft a lot to\nbe desired.\u201d\nChris Kaye spoke to Felix about\nthe event afterwards. As one of\nhis manifesto pledges to provide\nevents for non-drinkers, Chris was\na key driving force behind Dri. \u201cI\npersonally think this night was not\nunsuccessful. We were able to provide\nan event that was suitable for not just\nnon-drinkers, but those students that\nare under 18s, which, due to licencing\nrestrictions, couldn\u2019t previously enter\nthe Union bars.\nIt is difficult to get people into\nMetric at the best of times, especially\nwithout liquid lubrication.\u201d\nLesson learnt: never go in Dri\nOliver Benton covers the first non-alcoholic Union event of the year\nAn artist's impression of how the night panned out Photo: Thomas Lim\nRCSU Ballin\u2019... in moderation\nOFFICIAL FELIX BALLER\nJASPER MENKUS\nIn my ancestral Tennessee, we have\na saying: \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t\nfix it\u201d. Certainly this appears to be\nthe approach the RCSU has adopted\nin regards to their entertainments\nover the last few years. The recipe\ngoes something like this 1) Take a\ndark room in Central London. 2)\nAdd some loud music. 3) Fill with\nscientists soaked in inexpensive (or\nfree) alcohol. Shake and serve over ice\nwith a garnish of mint leaves.\nThe mixture is simple but effective\n\u2013 in some cases cripplingly so.\nDetails do change Monday\u2019s DJ was\nprobably the worst in recent memory\n(seriously, who mixes Don\u2019t Stop\nBelievin\u2019 with Who Let the Dogs\nOut? Who does that? Who? Who?).\nOpal is a pretty uninspiring venue,\nbeing essentially like Metric but with\nnicer seats. But on the whole, the\nformula is a tried-and-tested crowd\npleaser despite a nasty suit-ruining\ndownpour, so many students turned\nup that at times Opal\u2019s dancefloor\nthreatened to burst at the seams. The\nnumber of no-shows and nappers in\nTuesday morning\u2019s lectures testified\nto an enjoyable night, and the most\ncommon complaint was, \u201cI can\u2019t\nbelieve they rickrolled us!\u201d, after Rick\nAstley\u2019s one-hit wonder filled the\nsound system shortly after midnight.\nDecrying student drinking as\n\u2018dangerous\u2019, or \u2018irresponsible\u2019 appears\nto be something of a national pastime\nthese days. I think the critics don\u2019t\nrealise how healthy it is to have the\noccasional raucous night with old\nfriends and new faces alike. RCSU\nWelfare Officer Akash Jyoti later\nmentioned that RCSU\u2019s balls would\nbe good for student welfare on the\nwhole (although this is far from being\nofficial RCSU policy).\nIt\u2019s true that this was one of\nRCSU\u2019s less extravagant events\n(what, no vodka luge? No chocolate\nfountain? Outrage!), and to those\nof us outside the RCSU committee,\n\u2018business as usual\u2019 may seem a\nlittle disappointing. But it\u2019s worth\nremembering that events like\nthis never happen by themselves\norganising an event that is a) well-attended and b) where everyone goes\nhome happy is a major feat in itself.\nCongratulations are due to RCSU\nPresident Serena Yuen and her team\n\u2013 we look forward to many more such\nevents over the next year.\nPhoto: Benjamin Lester\n\n"
