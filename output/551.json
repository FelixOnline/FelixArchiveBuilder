    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nPAUL COLLINS' BEAT - Paul\nCollins' Beat\nThe group used to be called The Beat,\nbut they have changed their name to Paul\nCollins' Beat to avoid confusion with The\nBeat (of Tears Of A Clown fame).\nOf the twelve songs on the record, none really stands out above any of the\nothers, although none of them provoke\nthoughts such as \" What a load of\nrubbish\". The music itself is fairly good\nfrom the point of view of musicianship\nand melodic is m, but at the same time is\npredictable, boring and flat. When I say it\nis predictable, boring and flat, I mean it is\njust like all of the other Elvis Costello/Joe\nJackson rip-offs that the whole world and\nhis dog seem to be doing recently. In fact,\ntn at is the best description of the band \u2014\nt ney are in the Costello/Jackson mould,\nwith the same sort of songs (about girls,\nwork, Rock'n 'Roll (Maan), girls, etc). The trouble, however, is that they have none\nof the originality or visual impact of their\npeers.\nAn objective critique of the album; the\nsongs are well written and well played and\nthe band perform well within the limitations\nof ' Rock and Roll'. Subjective critique: the\nsongs are written about the same old subjects, ie, girls, rock 'mythology', etc. The\nband play well, but threaten nothing and\nappear to lack a certain 'something'. Paul\nCollins' Beat are probably lauded as ' New Wave' in the USA, which they are \u2014 with\nrespect to the Eagles.\nTo sum up: this is a mildly pleasant, easy\ni is ten ing album which is a little like aural\nwallpaper. None of the songs are mentioned\nby name, due to their anonymity.\nHYPNOTISED - The Undertones\nThe return of the Undertones with their\nsecond eagerly awaited (by me and John Peel, at least) second album. It's good to\nreport that this album is as good as their\nbe but last year. Since the release of the\nclassic Teenage Kicks EP in autumn 1978,\nthe Undertones have hardly put a foot\nwrong.\nThere are fifteen songs on the album,\nall of which deserve the bored teenager\nseal of approval. Particularly outstanding\nare Hard Luck, Hypnotised, Whizz Kids,\nUnder The Broadwalk, Tearproof,\nWhat's With Terry and last, but almost\nfirst, Wednesday Week, the single My\nPerfect Cousin is also included. The songs all deal with the joys and pain of\nteenage life: girls, insecurity, friends, etc.\nFeargal Sharkey's vocals are a well nigh\nDerfect foil to the rest of the band, the\nslight quaver in his voice gives an added\ndimension to the meaning of the songs.\nThe first track, More Songs About\nChocolate And Girls is in many ways the\nBABY'S GOT A GUN - The Only\nOnes\nThe Only Ones are destined to be one of\nthose really great bands that never attain\nsuccess on a large scale. They have\nalready reached cult status with a small\nminority of rock worshippers, as their\nability to pack out the Lyceum with devout and enthusiastic followers has\nshown.\nWith Baby's Got A Gun, their third\nalbum to date, they remain as inaccessible\nto the huge audience of pop radio stations as they did at the beginning of\ntheir career. Their music is such that it\nneeds to be heard several times before it\nhooks, and their is no single that can be\ntaken from the album which would receive enough airplay to really catch-on;\nthe best hope would be \"Why Don't You\nKill Yourself?\", which just might ignite\nsome spark of curiosity in a slumbering\nDJ who needs to fill an awkward two and\na half minute gap in his programme.\nPerret's voice is as hypnotic as ever, a strange but seductive quality from a larynx that does its best to imitate the\nquality of sound emitted from a concrete\nmixer, but backed by a band with as\nmuch experience behind them as musical\nmuscle, the voice blends in with the\noverall sound and becomes as much a_ part of the Only Ones as the distinctive\nstructure of the songs. The album does\nnot have quite the same ex i cite ment as\ntheir last long player, Even Serpents\nShine, but this is made up for by the\nextra polish that has gone into the latest\ndisc, but as Serpents must have been one\nof the best albums to be released last\nyear it would be difficult to better.\nThere is something quite irresistible about the pull that the highly original style\nof music can exert on the listener, the\nmelodies are so seductive that it would be\neasy to forget the power behind the\nsongs, laid down by Alan Mair, on bass,\nand Mike Kelly( ex Spooky Tooth) on drums so strongly and efficiently that the\nrhythm and lead guitar work are just icing\n6 n the cake.\nTwo tracks are outstanding, both appear on the first side. Why Don't You\nKill Yourself? is particularly noteworthy,\nboth for its immediate, effective and very\nstrong melody, and the vicious, but witty\nlyrics that help draw attention to a very\nstrong song, if there is another single on\nthe album it is this one. The other track\nworthy of particular mention is Deadly\nNightshade, which manages to produce a great feeling of melancholy and depression\nwhilst gently rocking the listener. Both these\nsongs, like the whole album can stand the\ntest of repeated playing, without saturating,\nand when the volume is turned up the\nband really show their muscle.\nWhen it comes down to it, you may as well\nstop Pretending, forget about Getting Happy, this is the best album to emerge so\nfar this decade.\nSHAKIN' STREET -Shakin' Street\nShakin' Street's second album and I'd like\nto start off with a moan. Yet another band appear to depend on a female singer\nto sell their records; Fa bienne Shine appears all clad in leather, inviting all\nsorts of S and M fantasies. Groups should sell records on the contents of the\nmusic not the contents of their singer's bra. Who would give Blondie house room, were it not for Ms Harry's pretty\nface?\nThe record, however, is not what I had\nfeared, in fact it is reasonably good. Produced by Sandy Pearlman of Clash\nand Blue Oyster Cult fame, the record\nowes some of it spunky sound to Pearlman' s experience with the Clash. Ross the Boss (Dictator's guitarist) plays\non the album as lead guitarist.\nOn the first side No Compromise, Solid\nAs A Rock and No Time To Loose stand\nout, by nature of thier speed and attack\nalthough the stupid applause and cheering\nmixed in ont he beginning and various\nstages of Solid As A Rock are irritating.\nOn the other side Generation X and So\nFine are quite good. The songs themselves\ndeal with the ever popular themes of\nrevolution, authority, wild youth, etc; another album to drive your parent crazy\n(sic). Fabienne Shine's voice isn'to u it e in\nthe Siouxsie Sue class, but compares favourably with the Nolans.\nThe group still have much to do before\nthey become memorable. In Zigzag of\nSept1977, Tony Parsons said, in his\nreview of the Mont de Marsan punk festival: and the crew with the\nmoney thigh ed singer,S hak in' Street, churn out a kind of Punk Hit Parade Pastiche that bores me shit less.\" Well,\nthey've improved on that,\nbest, acting as an introduction to the rest\nof the songs, advising you to \" Settle down, cancel all engagements\" to listen to\n\" Teenage Dreams that are worth a mention\" and\" Dumb entertainment\". Great. How is it, though, that the Undertones, with all their songs about\nteenage'kicks, etc, succeed where many\nother bands fail? For me, the answer is\ntheir almost painful normality; they look\nlike people that you see out in the real\nworld, and they come out and say what\nthey mean directly, rather than coming\nover all mystic and serious (and boring)\n\u2014 they're a fun band.\nAlong with the Ramones, the Specials,\nthe Jame, Burning Spear, Selectors and\nLinton K we si Johnson, the Undertones\nare one of the few groups /individuals I trust. This record is great. Search and\nenjoy.\nPaul Collins' Beat, Hypnotised and Shakin'\nStreet reviewed by Simone Jerome. Baby's Got A Gun reviewed by Chris Watts.\n\n"

However, such merriment had to be delayed due to the inconvenience\nof these Bally-old chap pies wanting to play\nus at cricket.\nSalter won the toss, and elected to bat;\nthis was to prove a teens ie we en sie bit\ncareless.

Prices quoted are often for off-peak season travel only, and an example\nis given of a return flight to Athens advertised at \u00a3119, but which did not\ninclude UK or Greek airport taxes or fuel\nsurcharges, increasing the real cost of the\nflight to \u00a3148.50.\nSt Seal Travel* offer flights to a wide\nvariety of European destinations at highly\ncompetitive prices( eg, peak Athens return \u00a3124).\nUS IT* deal with student charter flights\n(eg, Athens return in July \u00a3109), but to be\neligible you must have a valid International\nStudent Identity Card and be aged between\nsixteen and thirty.\nFor holidays which include accommodations( either in hostels or camping)\nthe National Student article recommends\nthe BST* products; however, these are\nonly available to France, Italy and Greece.\nIn general, the advice given to people\nwanting to book a flight abroad is simple\n\u2014 always read the small print (especially\nwith regard to surcharges) and book through your local student travel office \u2014\nit's their job to give you the best deal\navailable.\nMalcolm Brain\n* Services available from London Student\nTravel( IC office along the walkway,s her field Building).\nruns, despite Sen's arduous half-of-the-match innings of one.\nBeing all out within approximately an\nhour and a half, for 51, our confidence was\nfurther boosted by the promise of marmite\nand cucumber sandwiches for tea.\nThis inspired, Ratm an and Sen bowled\nsome spirited rubbish and Balliol were soon\n52 for 1.\nTea was taken and a ten 9-ball over beer\nmatch arranged. The teams reversed their\nbatting orders, and everyone was to bowl.\nSupersub Redmond replaced Head-band\nChad band( injured tripping over his hair)\nand scored a lusty sixteen.

Unfortunately, IC fell\nfour short of the Balliol total of 75 with\nHew kin next-man-in, waiting to score a second match-winning duck.\nThe Balliol bar overflowed with jugs\noverflowing with beer, but Salter insisted on\nremoving the team at nine o 'clock, leaving\nHew kin and Chad band to return with the\nSunday (Prince Panthers) XI.5 "

    "content": "IC LEAD EXPEDITION TO THE SOLOMAN ISLANDS\ni Next Sunday, 7:15 World About Us BBC2\nThe ideas behind this project were hatched in mid\n1978 and shortly after the group was formed.\nAfter much thought the basic aims were set out:\nto travel to the Solomon Islands and document, in\n\u2022 one particular area, the construction methods for\nthe almost ubiquitous dugout canoe, and to try\nand find and record the construction details and\nlegends behind the much rarer and larger war\ncanoes, ' tomo kos', previously used for\nhead hunting. The feasibility of the project soon became\napparent. Travel is none too cheap and\nphilanthropists with money to spare were few\nand far between. So, typewriters were dusted\noff and the two-fingered race for sponsorship\nbegan. Regular meetings between London, Oxford, Sidmouth, Brighton and Cambridge\nproduced much by the way of equipment lists,\na lot of which was already being collected, but\nlittle of the vital cash, and as we had calculated\non a budget of \u00a36,000 things began to get a little disturbing.\nOur luck changed when we acquired the\napproval and support of the Imperial College\nExploration Board. Other organisations then\nfollowed with their support or at least\nshowing some interest. We were then fortunate\nenough to receive one of the Mick Burke awards, six were given out of 400 applicants,\nbut our troubles were not over. The point of\nno return came in March 1979 when, in order\nto qualify for the cheapest air fares possible\ntickets had to be purchased. By this time we\nhad raised enough to buy the tickets but with\nlittle to spare. However, we took the plunge\nknowing that if it transpired that we couldn't depart in June due to lack of funds, we\nwouldn't get anything back on the rickets!\nHaving begged and borrowed the necessary\nremaining cash, thrown out all but the bear\nmini u mum of clothing from our packs, completed the customs formalities for all our\nrather heavy camera gear, we finally set off for\nthe Pacific.\nWe were still apprehensive when we reached\nthe capital Honiara, as we hadn't got the\nrequired government research permit, due to\nbureaucratic delays on their part, and thus\ncould have been refused entry, but we passed\nthrough customs unscathed and were welcomed\nby someone unknown to any of us. It\nwas pure luck that anyone met us at all; a letter to our initial contact, who was then on\nleave, had been intercepted by this person. We\nwere very grateful for the ride into town and\nfor the initial help we were given. Luckily, we\nsorted out most things and obtained our official\ndocuments in the following few days.\nWe left the mission hostel where we stayed\nfor a week and joined the colourful, noisy, and\ncheerful throng of islanders who travelled with\nus up to the Western Province. An old\nbattered boat, bought from the Japenese\ncomplete with permanent list, served as our\nmeans of transport. During our twenty-four\nhour journey we went through our first Pacific\nstorm in which we got a little wet. Turns were\ntaken to sleep in the cabin that we had\nobtained primarily to store our equipment, and\nthere we discovered the delights of having\ncoach roaches crawl over your legs and face\njust as you doze off. The place was infested.\nThose of us who stayed there for more than\nhalf an hour had to sleep with the light on.\nWe finally arrived in Munda one of the larger\nsettlements in the area, which, as well as having\na jetty, boasts a one mile airstrip built by\nAmericans during the war. Here we established\nour base with the help of contacts in the\nforestry department.\nOur two female members of the expedition\nclaimed their first accidents within four days of\nour arrival. One, while testing the cool lagoon\nwaters, swam through a sea urchin colony,\nwhich left her with about forty spine tips in her\nright hand and wrist. The other developed a serious allergic reaction against tuna fish,\nwhich at that time we were eating a lot.\nHaving recovered from these two setbacks,\nwe quickly acc lim at is ed to the heat and\nhumidity as we walked to the surrounding\nvillages to speak to the elders and anyone else\nwho had any knowledge of canoes and associated custom stories, and in some cases\nwe spoke to old men who had actually taken\npart in head hunting raids, the last of which\nwas about 1910. We mostly spoke in Pidgin\nEnglish, which we picked up fairly rapidly.and\nused interpreters from the villages when\nnecessary. As we talked, so the stories and\nlegends built around tomo kos were divulged to\nus, our information on construction techniques\ngrew and our list of possible contacts in other\nvillages expanded.\nTo reach the f uther places, long and often\nhazardous trips were made in large dugouts\nfitted with outboard motors. Constantly aware\nof the shark infested waters of the Pacific, we\nwere driven by skillful islanders who knew the\nseas well, which often threatened to swamp the\ndugouts. On one such journey we had to turn\nback having already travelled forty-five minutes\nbecause of heavy seas. On reaching the village\nwe obtained another slightly larger canoe and\nset out again. By this time it was late in the\nevening, but we had to press on and navigate\nby moonlight in very heavy swell as we took\nwith us a young boy who earlier had a fish\nhook cut his eye open, and we were heading in\nthe direction of the nearest dressing station.\nSadly, in such a place little can be done for this\ntype of accident. Although we reached the\nstation, we discovered later that he didn't reach proper medical aid until four days later,\nfar too late to save his eye.\nWe would spend up to one week in any one\nvillage and return to our 'base' every two or\nthree weeks. We often split up and went off in\ntwo groups varying the combination of\nexpedition members each time. On arrival at a village we explained our purpose in Pidgin and\nwere almost always given accommodation in\none of the village huts. We tried, successfully,\nto become part of the village in which we\nstayed, instead of being just of novelty value to\nthe islanders, by living with families and eating\ntheir staple foods of cabbage, sweet potato,\nyam and taro which they delighted in showing\nus how to prepare. We also attended their\nfeasts, a wedding, a baptism and were shown\nthe construction of a bamboo band.\nLife wasn't all roses; sanitation was often a problem . . . especially always followed us\naround and we were mercilessly bitten by\ns and flies, mosquitoes and in some areas bed\nbugs, the bites of which went septic very fast,\nas did any form of wound.\nSlowly we added to our record of both the\ndugouts and tomo kos meeting in our tracks\none of the last men able to build a war canoe.\nAltogether we met with great success and it\nwas with some sadness that we waited for the\nboat to return to Hani ara and thence homewards.\nIan Barber Bill Hamilton\nI.C.
