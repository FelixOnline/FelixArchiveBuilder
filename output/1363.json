    "content": "femm 8\nFriday 10th November 2006\nGuitars, giving and some chari-Ts\nIgnore the poor pun in the title, The Yellow Bird Project is a project that\nhas inspirational artists and bands designing T-shirts. The profits from\nthe selling of the shirts goes to various charities. Matty Hoban speaks\nto one of the founders and sheds some light how such an interesting\npremise came about and what the future of the project will entail.\nT\nhis may sound petty\nand cheap but I know\nI\u2019m not the only person\nwho gets annoyed by\nthe charity representatives who harass you\non the street. I am a\ncharitable person, and\nI have done quite a bit of volunteering for\nvarious causes including Amnesty International. It actually depresses me that I\nhave to say no to a charity due to having\nbarely any money, and they make me feel\nbad for it. It is exploitation. So any time I\nsee an inventive and genuine charitable\ncause I get enthusiastic about it. One such\ncause that has come to my attention recently is called the Yellow Bird Project, a\nMontreal-based community.\nThe premise is simple; bands and the\nproject design T-shirts together, sell them\nand give the proceeds to charities of the\nartists\u2019 choice. It is a brilliant way of promoting a great musical community and\ncontributing to something good whilst\ngiving the fans a cool-looking T-shirt. The\nartists involved are predominantly from\nacross the Atlantic (not as many from\nMontreal\u2019s impressive scene as yet) and\ninclude: Hayden (a Canadian singer-song-writer); Stars (gorgeous Canadian indie-pop); Clap Your Hands Say Yeah (ubiqui-tous indie-rockers); Devendra Banhart\n(folk king who was the first to get involved\nin the project); Wolfmother (Australian\npsychedelic-rock); King Creosote (mak-ers of Scottish folk-inspired bliss); Joseph\nArthur (singer-songwriter from Ohio);\nMy Brightest Diamond (Michigan-based\nsometime Sufjan Stevens collaborator);\nand Rilo Kiley is soon to collaborate. With\na wide array of artists, there should be a\nlot of appeal.\nFemm managed to get in touch with one\nof the founders, Casey Cohen, and learn\na bit more about the project. With such a\nunique project, I was interested in what inspired him to do it. \u201cMusic is what inspired\nme initially. I have always been profoundly\ninfluenced by music. It motivates me to get\nin touch with myself. When we identify with\nsomething that we are passionate about, it\nhelps us lead a more authentic life. Then we\nstart thinking about how important it is to\nhelp others. So in some way I believe that\nmusic can be a catalyst for helping others.\nSo many people are inspired by music, and I\nwanted to find a way to harness that inspira-tion, and push it in a charitable direction.\u201d\nI\u2019m sure many of you who are reading are\ngenuinely interested in music and share his\nvision and feel the need to do something but\nmight find it difficult to get in touch with\nartists or organize something but Casey assured us that, \u201cSometimes these bands are\nbusy on tour or recording, and it can be difficult to correspond with them. But invariably\nwe get through to them, and they\u2019re always\nreally encouraging and supportive.\u201d Starting the project like this means finding artists who would share the vision and Casey\nsays, \u201cI approached a group of my favourite\nartists, who I thought would be willing to do\nthis in the first place. They tend to be the\nmore introspective poet types, who have the\ncapacity to reach out to people on a more\nhumane level.\u201d\nWhether you like the music or don\u2019t, as you\nare entitled, I\u2019m sure you can agree with the\ncauses, which vary from The Teenage Cancer Trust \u2013 Wolfmother\u2019s charity of choice \u2013\nto Art for Change, a charity promoting social\nprogression and justice through art, a cause\nto which Clap Your Hands Say Yeah want\nto donate. Casey informs me that, \u201cMost of\nthese bands have chosen charities which\nare really personal to them, and I think that\nthat is something else that gives this project\nspecial meaning.\u201d With this message of\ncharity, it becomes obvious that they aren\u2019t\nworking through the big, brash\nand ultimately superficial statement\nthat Live8, amongst\nothers, does. Sure, they\nwere promoting the very\ngood cause \u2013 the end to poverty \u2013 but seeing huge Nokia\nads and big, corporate rock\nstars who make far too much\nmoney stumble onstage after a\ncoke binge and talk about dying\nchildren, this didn\u2019t sit well with\nme. With this project, a message of community gets carried\nthrough and as Casey says, \u201cIt\nis not just about fundraising, it\u2019s\nalso about facilitating a community of artists, and spreading the word\nabout their music.\u201d It is a cohesive and\nprogressive vision.\nThis vision starts small and he [Casey] is\nthe first to acknowledge this, \u201cI\u2019m not trying\nto change the world, I\u2019m just trying to make\na difference in people\u2019s lives in the same\nkind of way that these artists do. When I\nspoke to the director of Le Chainon, the local Montreal women\u2019s shelter, she told me\nthat they were short on food reserves,\nand that with 1000 dollars they will\nbe able to help serve nutritious\nmeals to their guests. So I know that\u2019s we\u2019re\nmaking a difference in people\u2019s lives, and\nmusic is the catalyst which enables us to do\nthat.\u201d The huge actions of ending poverty\nshould start small, without the bureaucracy,\nand gain momentum by giving people something to believe in as opposed to hearing\nRazorlight\u2019s latest single and going home\nunaffected.\nI asked Casey about the future of the\nproject and I was informed of the short-term plans like, \u201cRilo Kiley\u2019s T-shirt will\nbe ready in a week or so. Other artists who\nhave confirmed are Jose Gonzalez, Raine\nMaida (from Our Lady Peace) and Chantal\nKreviasuk, and Holly Throsby. We\u2019re also\ngoing after another group of bands, so people should continue to visit our site for updates.\u201d The website is www.littlebirdproject.\ncom and you can find out about the charities\nto which the bands have selected and you\ncan purchase the T-shirts for \u00a315 including\nshipping. When asked about longer term\nplans such as shows to promote the project,\nhe said, \u201cThis is something that we have\nbeen thinking about and maybe at some\npoint down the line we will try to put on\na benefit concert. At the moment we have\nour hands full, but we\u2019ll see what happens.\nI guess it would seem like the next logical\nstep though.\u201d I look forward to when they\ncan group all the artists together and put\non a great show.\nOn a more personal level, I asked what\nhis favourite artist was, out of all of those\non the project. He replied that, \u201cI love all\nof them, and I go through so many phases,\u201d but he conceded that, \u201cI would probably say my favourite has to be Stars. At\nleast they rank highest in my iTunes top\n25, I know that much.\u201d I think I\u2019d agree\nwith him, they make wonderful and addictive music and the T-shirt they designed\nhas a cool design of someone sleeping\nwith their headphones on with stars radiating from the headphones. Let\u2019s hope the\nYellow Bird Project makes as much of an\nimpact on people as the music, because\nthat\u2019s what it all comes down to, passion\nabout music.\nClockwise from top-left; Stars, King Creosote, Wolfmother and Clap Your Hands\n\n"

    "content": "\u201cI just cannot betray their interests\u201d\nWhy did Southampton leave the\nNUS?\nSouthampton left the NUS in 2002\nbecause it was considered very\nbad value for money. Southampton\ncould not see any clear reason to\nspend the affiliation fee and after\ninvestigation we found out that we\ncould do everything the NUS supposedly does for us in-house . The\n\u2018National Voice\u2019 that we had never\nlistened to us and was far too radical to represent our students.\nHow much have you saved on\naffiliation fees and how have you\nput the money to better use?\nSince we left, we have saved over\n\u00a3200,000.\nWe have built a state of the art\nradio station, our AU budget has\ndramatically increased, we have\ndoubled our own Welfare and Education campaigns budgets (so we\ncan run Ed/Wel campaigns our\nstudents want to see and ask for,\nnot some NUS forced campaign),\nwe have doubled our own external\ncampaigns budget, we have refurbished our nightclub and bars and\nwe are about to start on a capital\nproject to refurbish our shop.\nWe have hired more members of\nstaff \u2013 a postgraduate coordinator\nwhich has greatly improved our\nrepresentation, and a course-rep\ncoordinator which means we have\na very effective rep system set up\nnow. These are things that make a\ndifference to student\u2019s day to day\nlives on campus. They care about\ngetting a degree, having a good\ntime, and getting a job.\nThis is what Southampton University Students Union aims at doing,\nand we do it very well, far far better\nthan we ever could in the NUS.\nWhy were you asked to leave the\nbalcony at the NUS conference?\nFunnily enough I went to NUS conference to sit on the balcony and\nlearn about their democracy and\nhow they do things.\nI became increasingly disillusioned and frustrated with their\nwhole process and this was climaxed by being thrown off the\nbalcony. It was during the \u201cban\nCoca-Cola\u201d motion \u2013 someone on\nthe balcony from a radical group\ngot upset and started screaming at\nthe chair of conference. As a consequence the NUS President decided\nto throw the 100+ people off the\nbalcony because they couldn\u2019t deal\nwith one person. This is the way the\nNUS manages and handles things\n\u2013 abysmally.\nWhat was going on at the\nconference?\nNUS Conference was the single biggest joke I have ever seen in my entire life. I saw their National Exec\nexplain how they were in \u00a3500,000\nof debt and get off scot-free. Nobody holds them to account. If I ran\nSouthampton into a relative \u00a350,000\nof debt I would be grilled and most\nlikely sacked!\nI saw the NUS waste time on\nuseless \u2018No Platform\u2019 policy and I\nsaw them prioritise the Coca-Cola\ndebate over the AUT debate. As a\nresult, it left them in such a mess\nlast year and thousands of students\nwere disrupted.\nSeveral Unions were so upset\nwith the NUS\u2019 stance on the AUT\nstrike and their lack of democracy\nthat they threatened to disaffiliate.\nThat was very nearly the end of the\nNUS and their so-called effective\n\u2018National Voice\u2019.\nSouthampton President Ben Rogers talks to Stephen Brown about why the welfare of Southampton\nstudents is best served keeping their union out of the NUS and why Imperial students should vote No\nDo Southampton students have\nproblems getting discounts?\nVery rarely. Businesses care about\nstudent trade, not about the NUS\nlogo. Any club or business that our\nstudent have a problem with normally one letter or phone call from\nthe Union President explaining the\nsituation about the NUS and the\nproblem is solved.\nYou may have more money, but\nsurely this leaves your Union isolated with no external influence?\n\u2018No external influence\u2019 not at all\n\u2013 we are having an influence right\nnow! Southampton wants a National Union, but it has tried for so long\nto change things from the inside.\nBut nobody listens. If you are not\nin a faction you are marginalised. If\nyou do not have the support of Labour Students and the other main\nfactions your motion will not get\nthrough. The only way the National\nUnion will change is if student unions start to leave. Why do you think\nthey swarm campuses whenever a\nreferendum appears? They need\nthe money to survive. Withdrawing\nthis money forces them to listen.\nSouthampton has \u2018been on its own\u2019\nfor 4 years and just last year alone\nour President met with the head\nof the AUT, Sally Hunt and was on\nBBC Breakfast News putting our\nstudents views across during the\nstrike. There are many ways to get\na national voice you just need to be\nproactive about it and be proactive\nwhen working with other Unions.\nWhat is your opinion on the NUS\nattitude to top-up fees?\nI think that recent articles have severely damaged the NUS\u2019s stance\non tuition fees. The government\nI\nf I had been around during the\nlast referendum, I would probably have voted \u201cno\u201d. Back\nthen there were serious concerns about the structure and\nfinances of the NUS, along with unansweredquestionsregardingICU\u2019s\nability to pay the affiliation fee. Since\nthen the financial and political climates within both the NUS and ICU\nhave changed, which is why I have\nchanged my mind and now support\nthe \u201cyes\u201d campaign. In spite of these\nchanges, I am still seeing many of\nthe old arguments against the NUS\nresurfacing even though most of\nthem no longer apply to this debate.\nSo, even if your mind is set, please\nallow me to guide you through some\nof the myths that I personally believe\nno longer apply to this debate.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford the affiliation\nfee\u201d: We currently pay \u00a379,000 each\nyear to affiliate to ULU. When we\nleave ULU next year, we could, in\ntheory, use this money to pay for\nthe \u00a352,000 NUS affiliation fee, leaving plenty of money spare. The key\npoint is that, unlike last time, clubs\nfunding and beer prices would be\ncompletely unaffected if we affiliate\nto the NUS.\n\u201cIf we join then I won\u2019t be able to\nbuyKitKatsfromtheUnionshop\u201d:\nThe ICU Executive has categorically ruled out affiliating to NUSSL (the\nNUS buying consortium that imposes these restrictions) so we will still\nbe able to sell Kit Kats, Pepsi, Real\nAle and anything else that takes our\nfancy.\n\u201cThe NUS is in debt\u201d: Thanks to\nmajor restructuring in recent years,\nNUS finances are now sound and\nthe organisation is no longer in debt.\nDun and Bradsheet, who specialise\nin risk assessment, named the NUS\n\u201cone of the most financially viable organisations in the sector\u201d last year.\n\u201cThe NUS is dominated by political factions\u201d: The majority of NUS\nstudents and officers, including the\ncurrent President and several Executive committee members, do not\novertly support any political party\nand stood for election as \u201cIndependents\u201d. Furthermore, although there\nare political elements within the\nNUS just as there are within Imperial\u2019s student body, the consensus\nwithin NUS is that there has been\na shift towards the centre-ground\nwithin recent years.\n\u201cNUS conference is dominated\nby discussions on foreign policy\u201d:\nThanks to recent changes, the vast\nmajority of time at conference is allocated to issues that affect students\nas students. The reforms introduced\nlast year require 75% of conference\ndebating time to be devoted to students\u2019 unions, welfare, education\nand the NUS itself. The remaining\ntime is used to discuss other issues\nthat students wish to raise (e.g. Climate Change, Make Poverty History,\nthe fair-trade movement and so on).\nFor the record, none of the motions\npassed at the last conference mentions \u201cPalestine\u201d, \u201cIraq\u201d, or \u201cGeorge\nW Bush\u201d.\n\u201cWe could work with other independent unions as an alternative to joining the NUS\u201d: 98% of\nstudents in Higher Education are\nrepresented by the NUS. Those in\nEngland that aren\u2019t affiliated are\nSouthampton, Sunderland, Northampton, the Open University and\nus. The notion that we could form an\nalliance with these disparate institutions to somehow provide a counterbalance against the rest of the country is frankly ridiculous.\n\u201cThe NUS top up fees policy is\ndifferent from ours\u201d: This is simply\nnot true (for details, see my \u201cLive!\u201d\narticle). Anyway, we are and always\nwould be free to disagree with the\nNUS, and from time to time some affiliated unions do.\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing this because\nnow believes that the NUS have\nbeen scaring students off higher\neducation by not promoting the\nbenefits they bring to the poorest\nstudents. The NUS has been scare-mongering by presenting a doom\nand gloom picture about student\ndebt.\nEven on its National Demo, where\nwe had a chance to unite, the message was, again, confused and con-flated with many banners saying\ndifferent things. Some were shouting for a totally free education,\nsome were shouting for not lifting\nthe cap on top up fees, some were\nshouting against top-up fees as a\nwhole, some were shouting about\nthe war and how they should fund\neducation with this money instead \u2013\nwhere is the united message?! This\nkaleidoscope of opinion just blurred\nany sort of united messages the\nNUS wanted to give. Hardly worth\npaying \u00a350,000 for!\nWhat about the rumour that several Unions threatened to disaf-filiate during the lecturers strike\nbecause of the stance the NUS\nwas taking?\nThe NUS was originally supporting the lecturers in their pay claim.\nHowever the NUS never discussed\nwhat its stance should be at conference (too busy talking about no\nplatform policy and Coca-Cola) and\nseveral Unions were outraged. Led\nby Exeter Students\u2019 Union a breakaway group was almost formed.\nAround 30 students unions were\nso disillusioned they threatened to\nwithdraw their affiliation fees until\nthe NUS discussed its stance. This\nis the sort of \u2018collective action\u2019 and\n\u2018national voice\u2019 that Imperial can\nbuy for only \u00a352,000 a year!\nDescribe your typical NUS delegate and National Exec member.\nFrom what I have seen the typical NUS delegate follows a very\npredictable set of steps. Step one,\nforget about all the people you rep-resent. Step two, join a faction that\ninterests you. Factions are groups\nof \u2018buddies\u2019 that have similar interests and all gang up and club\ntogether and make war with other\ngroups of buddies with interests\nsometimes that differ at only a microscopic level.\nStep three is tow the party line\nand vote how your buddies vote,\nor you\u2019ll be kicked out of the buddy\ncircle. And that is where representation and democracy fails within\nthe NUS. A candidate can come\nforward with really good ideas and\nwho really could change things\u2026\nbut they will never get voted in if\nthey don\u2019t have the support of the\nbuddies. And you get support of\nbuddies by towing their line and\nsaying things they want to hear\u2026\nand then, again, this is where representation fails.\nIf you are in it for yourself, NUS\nis great because you have so many\nnew friends to make. You have loads\nof opportunity to run for all these\nexciting positions. Everyone claps\nand cheers you when you decide\nto re-affiliate, as was the case with\nEdinburgh. If I was in it for myself,\nI would take Southampton back in\ntoday\u2026 but when I remember the\nstudents I represent, and the state\nthat the NUS is in, I can\u2019t do it, I just\ncannot betray their interests in this\nway.\nI urge all Imperial students to\nvote no! You will always be able to\nfind like-minded unions, like Southhampton, to work with.\nEight common myths about the NUS exposed\nyou\u2019re a career politician vying for\na job in NUS\u201d: I am supporting the\n\u201cyes\u201d campaign because I don\u2019t believe that it is in our interests to be\nthe most isolated student union in\nLondon. When we leave ULU next\nyear we will lose our links with the\nfew student unions that we regularly interact with (e.g. LSE, UCL,\nKings, etc). This isolation will harm\nour Union and reduce its ability to do\nits job, representing the views of its\nmembers. I have no intention of running for an NUS position (this year\u2019s\ndeadline has passed anyway!). Besides, I have had enough of student\npolitics so I am off to find a proper\njob.\nSo I say let\u2019s give them a chance: I\naccept that the NUS has its faults \u2013\nall organisations do (including ICU).\nHowever, on balance I think that the\nbenefits of affiliating to the NUS easily outweigh the advantages of staying outside. If we join and find that\nthe NUS really is not for us, then we\ncan always hold another referendum in a couple of years. At the end\nof the day I see that NUS as a group\nof students, not too dissimilar from\nus, who work tirelessly to ensure\nthat the voice of students is heard\nso that the lives of those we claim to\nrepresent can be improved.\n\u201cOn balance I\nthink that the\nbenefits of\naffiliating to\nthe NUS easily\noutweigh the\nbenefits of\nstaying outside\u201d\nJohn Collins\n10 felix Friday 10 November 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "H\naving been dropped\nby their label and\nlosing bassist Didz\nHammond to Dirty\nPretty Things,\nThe Cooper Temple Clause have\nhad a difficult time\nthroughout the last couple of years. Prior\nto their gig at London\u2019s KOKO, we interviewed Kieran Mahon of the \u2018Clause and\nfound out about their new album, touring,\nand what they think about being a \u2018trendy\u2019\nband.\nAre you looking forward to this gig and\nthe tour?\nYeah well the London shows are normally\nthe pinnacle of the tour and this has come\nquite early. We\u2019ve only been on tour for\na week, so its going to be quite scary, we\nhaven\u2019t done as many shows as we\u2019d like\nin preparation. The last three shows have\nbeen really good so we\u2019re looking forward\nto hopefully taking that sort of energy to\na bigger crowd that we haven\u2019t played\nto like this for ages. We\u2019re officially from\nReading, but we\u2019ve always had a good rapport with London. We basically got spotted playing at the Bull and Gate at Kentfemm 6\nFriday 10th November 2006\nTwo schools of Brit-rock collide\nThe stalwarts of the \u2018Brit-rock\u2019\nscene, The Cooper Temple Clause\nare back with new material. They\nrecently played at KOKO with\nsupport from Battle, an up-and-coming band from the new school\nof indie-rock. Jenny Gibson\nandTom Whitson catches up with\nthe former and Sam Lombard has\na word with Battle.\nish town so we\u2019ve always appreciated what\nLondon\u2019s done for us and the scene that it\u2019s\nalways had.\nAre you playing some of you the new stuff\nfrom your forthcoming album?\nIt\u2019s about fifty-fifty. Obviously people have\nheard Damage that we released as a free\ndownload a few weeks ago and Homo Sapiens which is on YouTube and our MySpace\npage, so hopefully they\u2019re be aware of those\nones. And the rest of them they don\u2019t know,\nbut they still go down well. People don\u2019t really\nhave a clue what\u2019s going on but we play new\nold new old so people don\u2019t get alienated\nThe new video from Homo Sapiens is\ngreat-was that your concept?\nNo it was a treatment that was sent in. We\nliked this one and it was quite fitting with\nthe theme of the lyrics, which is about using power and looking into how man has\ncorrupted various positions with the power\nthat he has been in, so we wanted to show\nin the video us killing corrupt dictators and\npoliticians. That\u2019s the side that didn\u2019t come\nout too clearly and the producers were more\ninto the random killings. We were looking at\nfilms like Sin City as a reference point with a\ncomic book style with the white blood splat-tering. Looking back at our videos they\u2019re\nquite eclectic and a bit weird, which is exactly the way we\u2019d want it. If there\u2019s anything\nthat we don\u2019t want it\u2019s to be predictable and\nformulaic. There\u2019s talk of the next video of\nmaybe continuing on from Homo Sapiens.\nAt the end we get dragged away and we may\nget dragged into the new one, but I can\u2019t reveal any more on that I\u2019m afraid.\nThe lyrics are very ambiguous and not\nvery definitive do you want to keep it so people can make up their own conclusions.\nI am not the main lyricist, but I think\nwhat\u2019s great is that we\u2019ve always wanted it\nto be open to interpretation, and Make This\nYour Own is all about that. It\u2019s about reading into the lyrics and applying them to your\nown life and seeing how you can take solace\nin them. That\u2019s the great power and comfort of music. When you\u2019re feeling down or\nhappy you might get something out of it. It\u2019s\nall a bit clich\u00e9d, but from the experience of\nour fan-base being so supportive we\u2019ve seen\nhow important it is really that our fan-base\nare the ones that we give it to and we\u2019re\nhanding it back to them. When you\u2019ve been\nin a position where you\u2019ve been abandoned\nby your record label and been to places that\nare quite dark and depressing, the one thing\nthat gets you through it is the support.\nBattle are supporting you tonight? Did you\nchoose them yourselves?\nYeah we had a few options. We wanted someone that we thought would attract people\nbut also that our fan-base would like. I\u2019m not\nsure if we have the right balance, I need to\nsee them a couple more times to make up\nmy mind. They\u2019re really nice guys and we\u2019re\ngetting on well which is the most important thing. And they\u2019re a support band that\ndoesn\u2019t take up too much time sound check-ing, or have too much stuff on stage like we\nhave. Its working out well, so hopefully tonight will be good.\nWhat sort of things to do you get up to on\nthe tour bus?\nWell it\u2019s a very claustrophobic, coffin-like at-mosphere. There\u2019re 5 of us in the band and 5\nof the crew. We usually just drink lots of red\nwine and beer, and watch some DVDs. We\u2019ve\nbeen watching Brass Eye lately, which is\nbrilliant, and Jam. I also like Arrested Development, so we watch a lot of that; Family\nGuy, South Park. Essentially it is like a big\ndormitory environment I suppose. If possible we don\u2019t stay on the bus, we go out, but\non long journeys you have to keep yourself\nbusy. You have to bagsy the best bunk so\nthe first person there gets the best bunk.\nOn one bus we did have a double room at\nthe back and our tour manager just took\nit straight away, so selfish. It did have an\noffice so he could do his work in.\nPeople are always under the illusion\nthat the Cooper Temple Clause is quite\na trendy image band, how do you view\nthat?\nWell I think we\u2019ve always felt a bit alienated from the trends that go on and we\u2019ve\nalways remained outside them because\nwe don\u2019t live in London and obviously\nwe\u2019ve always had our own sound that isn\u2019t\nbased on any bands that are around at\nthe moment. We\u2019ve probably got most appreciation for bands that less people have\nheard of like dEUS, Mogwai, Sigur Ros,\nmore instrumental a lot of the time, post\nrock experimental bands. But that\u2019s not to\nsay we just listen to that. There\u2019s a lot of\nmainstream stuff we listen to.\nWhat do you think of Dirty Pretty\nThings? Did you approve of bassist\nDidz\u2019s move?\nI think they\u2019re very musical. Of course it\nwas hard to approve of it at the time, because you feel a little bit hurt, but we\u2019ve\ncertainly kept up communication. He\u2019s\ncoming tonight and it\u2019s all amicable. He\nfelt that he had to move on and he was\nliving in a different place, with different\nfriends. Quite gradually you just realise\nyou can\u2019t be in the same group any more,\nbut I don\u2019t hold anything against them. I\nlike Dirty Pretty Things, I still need to see\nthem live. I\u2019ve seen them on TV and in videos but I still want to see them live. They\nremind me of some good parts of Elvis\nCostello and the Clash and that\u2019s a really\ngood thing.\nThe Cooper Temple Clause\u2019s new album\nMake This Your Own is out in January.\nHaving listened to their new material\nduring their headlining set at KOKO\u2019s, it\nis bound to be a well received follow on to\n2003\u2019s fantastic Kick Up the Fire and Let\nthe Flames Break Loose.\nBen of The Cooper Temple Clause (top right); The many, moody faces of TCTC (above)\nALL PHOTOS TOM WHITSON\n\n"

    "content": "Tumelty: \u201cI\u2019d like to speak for you\u201d\nGemma Tumelty is the NUS National President and the first from a post-1992 university. She was previously a\nsabbatical officer at Liverpool John Moores University and graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Applied Psychology\nI\n\u2019ve been president of NUS\nsince July 2006, and already\nsince then, I\u2019ve spoken as\nthe voice of students over 100\ntimes. I\u2019ve got the right to\nspeak on behalf of UK students because I lead the National Union of\nStudents UK, a democratic organisation where policy is decided at\nour Annual Conference, the largest democratic conference of it\u2019s\nkind. The NUS President speaks\non behalf of the largest democratic\nstudent movement in the world.\nI\u2019ve spoken to Ministers, to Government officials and to numerous\nbroadcast and print media. When\nI\u2019m asked to speak, what I say reflects and represents the \u2018voice of\nUK students\u2019, the sad thing is, when\nI\u2019m thinking of what to say, I never\nthink about Imperial\u2019s words, what\nImperial students want, what Imperial students need. I\u2019ve no way\nto hear your voice, you don\u2019t talk to\nme, you are not my member. You\ncan change that, you can speak to\nme, so that I can speak for you\u2026.\nHow? Just vote yes to NUS.\nI want to say how much I am\nlooking forward to the upcoming\naffiliation referendum at Imperial.\nIt will give this generation of Imperial students a chance missed\nby the generations before \u2013 to sign\nboth themselves and their union\nup to the wide range of benefits\nthat NUS offers. It has been 5 years\nsince students at Imperial last had\nthe chance to decide on their membership to the National Union, and\na lot has changed in those 5 years,\nboth in the education sector, but\nmore importantly inside NUS.\nThe last few years in NUS have\nbeen spent making the work of the\nNational Union more relevant to\nthe needs of our members (students\u2019 unions) and our member\u2019s\nmember\u2019s (students) \u2013 just like\nyou. NUS is widely recognised\nas the leading educational pressure group representing students\nthroughout the UK.\nWe talk weekly to the government\non behalf of students, we talk daily\nto the media on behalf of students,\nand we talk hourly to a wide range\nof national bodies and organisations such as Universities UK on\nbehalf of students. We are the recognised national voice of students\nacross the UK, and right now, not\nonly are Imperial College Union\nnot part of that national voice, the\nconcerns and views of Imperial\nStudents are not considered. This\nis your chance to change that!\nNUS campaigns and represents\non all issues that affect students\nas students, but we also do much\nmuch more. I recommend that\nthose of you who want to know\nmore look at our two websites\nwww.officeronline.co.uk and www.\nnusonline.co.uk. Here are the\nhighlights:\nWe campaign\n\u2022 We carry our campaign work on\na variety of student issues including fairer funding systems, better\nstudent housing and healthcare.\n\u2022 We have active liberations cam-paigns: LGBT, Black Students\u2019,\nWomens and Students\u2019 with\nDisabilities.\n\u2022 We provide official representation to government and national\nbodies.\n\u2022 NUS representatives sit on governmental committees and provide\nevidence which is used to shape\npolicies and inform legislation.\n\u2022 We produce research on student\nissues for publication, to raise public awareness of issues affecting\nstudents today.\nWe strengthen local union\nactivity\n\u2022 We have a Development Projects\nUnit, allowing your student activities to benefit from training, to\nnetwork and share ideas through\nStadia.\n\u2022 We provide research and infor-mation, support and advice for\nyour union officers on virtually any\narea of education and student life,\nfrom housing to franchise courses,\nstudent funding to women\u2019s issues.\nThere are also special projects on\naccommodation costs and student\nhealth.\nWe Make Commercial Sense\n\u2022 We produce the NUS Extra card,\nwhich gives students a range of\nhigh street discounts from clothing to music and computers. The\nExtra card will bring in an additional \u00a31,000,000 to students\u2019 unions across the country, with 40 per\ncent of the profits of the Extra card\nbeing channelled directly back into\nlocal students unions to be spent\nas each local union deems best.\nThe list goes on\u2026. but I\u2019ll leave\nit there. I believe that students at\nImperial will benefit enormously\nfrom joining with hundreds of other unions to campaign for those\nthings that affect us all. As we set\nup and develop the London Student Assembly to ensure the voice\nof London students is articulated\ndirectly to the GLA, as we continue to meet with TfL to enhance\nand sharpen the discount package\nfor London students and as we\ncontinue to lobby locally and nationally on behalf of students, I\u2019d\nbe delighted to be able to speak out\nfor you too. Not only that, but as\nNUS President I know more than\nanyone, that my organisation can\nnever reach its full potential until we can truly claim to speak for\nevery student, in every college and\nuniversity. I hope you will use your\nvote in this referendum to bring\nthat vision closer to reality.\nI\nwrote in Felix recently about\nmy concerns with NUS, and\nmy belief that come the referendum the vote should be\nNO! Firstly, it would be terribly arrogant of me to assume to\nknow much about Imperial College Union at all \u2013 I have been\nhere for all of six weeks and in that\ntime have had little opportunity to\ndelve into ICU. So, you might ask,\nhow can I have to audacity to state\nI know what\u2019s best for the union\nregarding NUS?\nThe answer to this is simple\n\u2013 I have plenty of NUS experience,\nand spent a year as the sabbatical\npresident of Durham Students\u2019\nUnion (DSU). It is NUS that is\nbroken, not Imperial. However,\nI would not recommend mouldy\nfood, a derelict property, the music\nof James Blunt or NUS to anyone,\nsimply because all of these things\nare a detrimental item to acquire\nregardless of your current status.\nOne of the concerns raised has\nbeen that we would have no representation should we not join.\nThis argument doesn\u2019t hold water for two reasons. Firstly, it is\nindeed possible to have a voice as\na single union. While the Higher\nEducation Act 2004 was being discussed Durham got several BBC\ninterviews, including national\nnews at six, they interviewed us\nin our Union, we got spots on local radio and they did a follow up\npeace on TV with us after the bill\nwas enacted.\nIt\u2019s worth emphasising that we\nwere just one union \u2013 all of this\nwas arranged without NUS. It\u2019s\nalso interesting to see people\ndescribe Imperial students as\napathetical as several have done\nto me \u2013 exactly the same charge\nwas constantly laid on Durham\nstudents. We can still have a voice\n\u2013 all it takes is work from the ICU\nsabbs, and I see no evidence that\nthey are not capable of this.\nWe need not work on our own\n\u2013 there are many unions who I\u2019m\nsure would be happy to work with\nus on targeted campaigns. We are,\nof course, still able to work with\nour friends at other colleges in\nLondon on relevant issues \u2013 good\nunions will work with other unions\nbecause they agree on a key prin-cipal, not because they happen to\nbe a member of NUS.\nWhen the topic of our voice on\nthe national arena is raised we\nalso need to look at a second point\n\u2013 is NUS the voice we want? Last\ntime I wrote I talked about the\ndysfunction of NUS\u2019 annual National Conference (NC). I don\u2019t\nwant to pretend there is nothing\nmore to NUS, but it\u2019s critical to\nrealise that NUS policy is decided by NC, and effectively by NC\nalone. The regional conferences\n(of which there are three a year)\nare a better opportunity to talk\nto NUS exec members (known as\nthe NEC), but they have no policy-setting power. This means that\nNUS principles for the year are\ndecided by the farce of National\nConference.\nIt is for this reason that the only\nline NUS will take on the student\nfunding issue is that of no-fees and\nfull grants. When I attended one of\nthe Mass Lobbies of Parliament I\nwas inside Parliament, speaking\nto MPs and trying to convince\nthem that the bill on the table was\nbroken and needed fixing. Some\non the NEC were helping, but others seemed much more interesting in protesting outside. When\none of the NEC sat down in the\nroad outside Parliament and in-so-doing infuriated the (otherwise\nhighly supportive) members of the\npublic it made me want to cry.\nThe atmosphere of NUS conference means that one of two\nmotions get passed \u2013 the so-obvi-ous-it-hurts motion, e.g. \u201cTo work\npositively to improve the student\nexperience in halls of residence\u201d,\nsomething you\u2019d hope NUS would\ndo even if they had no policy on\nit, or the rousing rhetoric \u201cContinue campaigning for\u2026grants\ncovering living cost [&] an end to\nall methods of charging for their\neducation\u201d\nNeither of these two types of motion are terribly helpful. One does\nwhat they\u2019d do anyway, and the\nother is understandably popular,\nbut avoids having a proper debate\nabout what we will and what we\nwon\u2019t accept as a funding proposal\nfor students. One cannot usefully\nengage with politicians or other\nopinion-formers without a well\nthought out policy. While at Durham NUS were great at providing\nme with placards and posters, but\nvery poor at providing me with anything to actively engage with the\ndecision makers.\nOne of the biggest troubles with\nNUS is that the constituent unions\nare all so different \u2013 a Further Education union receiving next-to-no money and with no facilities is\nin an entirely different world from\na large HE union. They will often\nhave very different policy views,\nwhich is partly why when NUS\nmake policy it\u2019s so bland or populist \u2013 it\u2019s about the only way you\ncan get an agreement.\nI don\u2019t think this is a voice that\nwill actively speak for Imperial.\nWe shouldn\u2019t join NUS because\nthere\u2019s nothing better of comparable scale. It\u2019s a terrible reason; one\nthat is logically deficient. However\nmuch we might desire it, we cannot fix NUS by joining it. We can,\nhowever, spend the \u00a350k+ a year\non projects in welfare, campaigning and facilities and get the very\nbest for students at Imperial.\nMy experience of the NUS and its campaigning\nTom Page\n\u201cWe can still\nhave a voice \u2013 all\nit takes is work\nfrom the ICU\nsabbs\u201d\n\u201cYou can change\nthat, you can\nspeak to me, so\nthat I can speak\nfor you. How?\nJust vote yes to\nNUS\u201d\nGemma Tumelty\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t\njoin NUS\nbecause there\u2019s\nnothing better\nof comparable\nscale.\u201d\n11\nfelix\nFriday 10 November 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Hugh Mansfield\ncolumns\nfemm\n3 Friday 10th November 2006\nM\nodern music is dreadful.\nThey don't make it like they\nused to. This is just noise.\nYou can't even make out the\nwords. Bring back rationing\nand/or hanging. And so on, ad nauseam.\nAccusations of dumbing down or suchlike in music have been around every bit as\nlong as music itself has been - no sooner did\nPope Gregory come up with plainsong than\ncongregations started muttering that it was\na poor successor to monotone chanting and\ncould'st thou turn it down, some of us are\ntrying to fast here. Not that this afflicts only\nthe one medium - for one thing, apparently\ntelevision has been going downhill ever\nsince its inception, which would suggest\nthat such classics as The Black and White\nMinstrel Show or It's That Man Again stand\nhead and shoulders above the dross peddled\nout decades down the line such as Cracker\nor The West Wing rather than being a sheer\nembarassment even to contemplate.\nIt's only natural for people to calim that\nthings were better in their youth because,\noften, that's true for the individual. But increasingly common is a trend for youngsters\n(such as our esteemed music editor himself)\nto come out with the same old sorely-mis-guided nonsense.\nThe simple truth is that the music that\nlasts is that which is most popular at the\ntime and, unsurprisingly, is most likely to\nremain popular in the present day. Consequently, all that is remembered of any bygone era is that which was popular, which is\nwhy Citizen Kane is still watched to this day,\nwhereas How Green Was My Valley isn't.\nAs a result, we end up comparing the entirety of modern music, which is fresh in the\nmemory (for better or for worse), with the\nenduring classics of any given era, rather\nthan comparing like with like and considering the dregs of each every bit as much as\nthe cream.\nConversely, those who dislike the popular works of the present every bit as much\nas those of the past (such as, say, me) find\nthe enduring works to be unbearable\nsuggesting that, in fact, modern music is\nfar better than that of any previous era.\nThis, too, misses the point - the weird\nand unconventional works of an era are,\nby and large, forgotten or worse still, unrecognised even at the time. This makes\ntracking them down very difficult indeed\nand stumbling across them is essentially\nimpossible.\nIn an age where getting hold of certain\nreleases is a lost cause even within the\nweek of their release, even despite the\nease of modern distribution and the wonders of internet piracy, what hope is there\nof finding an obscure work of genius released decades before? Or even of knowing about it, given the lack of the modern\npaper-trail that comes with all-but the\nmost low-key of self-released works?\nThe tragedy is that while the works of\nBuddy Holly or Abba are likely to endure\nfair longer than those of the Tornados\nor Leiutenant Pigeon, even those are\namongst the lucky ones still to be remem-bered. Those who claim there is in some\nway a deterioration in popular culture\nmiss out the crucial factor - that there is\na range of choice to modern media that is\nincreasingly no longer available to older\nworks as time goes by, so no matter how\ngood it may seem to some, it is nonetheless dreadfully limited and those who lose\nout in such situations are most certainly\nnot them. How terribly selfish.\nJames Millen\nI\nf there is one thing that strikes the\nfear of God into me it is the hyphenated word \u2018singer-songwriter\u2019. I would\nrather fill my brain cavity with whole\npickled monkey testicles via my nose\nthan have to listen to Damian Rice, Katie\nMelua, Jack Johnson, K T Tunstall, James\nBlunt, Joss Stone, Jamie Cullum etc. I\u2019m\nnot even sure if all of them write their own\nsongs. When these people decide they want\nto go solo they seem to lose all imagination,\nall vision and a big chunk of the enthusiasm\nthat was necessary for them to get where\nthey are.\nHowever, a band can also be a very stifling\nplace creatively. Often there is an individual\nwho has the real talent, which is diluted by\nhis or her band mates wanting their share of\nthe action. Like any team there have to be\ncompromises, and in many cases this leads\nto the total implosion of the group. Another\nconsequence of this is that it tends to lead to\na band having a \u2018sound\u2019. In the vast majority of cases you can tell the band solely by\ntheir music (vocals are often distinctive, so\nignore them for now), which is not always a\nbad thing. By album six however it\u2019s pretty\ntrying, and boring! Bands are in a market,\nthey are providing a service, they have a responsibility to be interesting to listen to.\nSo the thrust of this article is that all\nsinger-songwriters are crap, and all bands\nare crap. Give up now, and take embroidery\nclasses.\nActually the thrust of this article is that\nthere are many one-man bands out there\nwho have kept the torch of innovation burn-ing, and with a bit of effort maybe you could\nbe one of them. I was prompted to write this\nidea down (which has been rattling around\nin my head for a while) after seeing the Alt\nMusic Soc\u2019s first Kids Will Be Skeletons club\nnight at the union. The first band on was in\nfact one man (Black Static Transmission,\nwww.myspace.com/blackstatictransmis-sion), but you would never have guessed it\nif you were blindfolded. He built up an exciting wall of post-rock noise with just a guitar\n(um, and a universe of effects pedals) and a\nlooping device.\nA current favourite of mine is Jeremy\nWarmsley (www.myspace.com/jeremy-warmsley) who has just released his saintly\nalbum The Art of Friction. He writes using\na guitar and a laptop, to create wonderfully\nfractured, inventive indie music. Often it\u2019s\nbursting with energy, and I love the way he\nmashes instruments to bits with his computing machine. Another bedroom genius is\neveryone\u2019s favourite diminutive inde-disco\nmop head Tom Vek (www.tomvek.tv for a\nchange). Similarly to Mr Warmsley he composes using a bass guitar and a computer,\nbut cuts a funkier sound. In some places his\ndebut We Have Sound is scratchily retro, in\nothers dirtily modern.\nThere are a host of laptop wizards, but\nthat\u2019s not really the point I\u2019m trying to make,\nI\u2019m talking about the people who strictly are\nsinger-songwriters (touring with session\nmusicians doesn\u2019t count) but not shit. One\nof the most unique voices in music belongs\nto Martin Grech (www.myspace.com/mar-tingrechofficial), who on his MySpace\npage is described as \u201cAlternative/Industrial/Progressive\u201d. On his first album\nOpen Heart Zoo he showcased his amazing screaming falsetto amid itchy alternative rock, and, ahem, epic soundscapes.\nHis live shows were getting progressively\nmore frantic and heavy, so by his second\nalbum Unholy he was producing dark industrial metal, with so much space that\nit was truly a special and unique album.\nDoesn\u2019t sound your cup of tea? Well he also\nfrequently peppers his fans with haunting\none-man-and-a-guitar EPs.\nSo there is some listening fodder for you.\nDo you play the guitar but are not skilled\nenough to get your ideas out of your head?\nTry using a computer to help you, think\noutside the box. A technophobe? Then\nthere are actually a few good traditional\nsinger-songwriters out there (Liam Frost,\nDevendra Banhart, David Ford, Tom\nMcRae). Maybe in a few years people will\nbe getting excited about your music, and\nyou wont have to split your earning five\nways!\nopinion\nDevendra Banhart looking whimsical, prizes for guessing what he is entranced by\n\n"

    "content": "Why vote No? Do it for your club!\nM\nany people have\ncommented on the\nNUS referendum\nso far, covering\neverything from\ndiscounts to representation. This\ntime round I want to cover the\nthings most people care about\n\u2013 clubs & societies. I know that this\nextra money that we are saving\nfrom ULU could do a lot of good for\nclubs. Last year I was ACC Chair,\nresponsible for ensuring that all of\nImperial\u2019s sports clubs were running smoothly. I also organised the\nodd ACC Barnight, which seem to\nhave gained a certain notoriety.\nThis is why I feel so strongly about\nwhy Imperial students should vote\nNo! to joining the NUS.\nFar too many people dismiss us\nas \u201capathetic.\u201d Quite the opposite\nis true in fact. Imperial College\nhas one of the highest club participation rates in the country. They\nare all run by dedicated volunteers\nand members turn out regularly.\nThis is evidence of a student body\nwho relishes getting involved, not\none that lets the world drift past\nthem. Just because you don\u2019t give\na toss for union politics (lets face\nit, who does?) it dosen\u2019t make you\napathetic.\nThe NUS will tell you that they\ncan make your clubs better (in fact,\nthey did on Live! last week at live.\ncgcu.net/editions/nus/1318). For\nsports clubs, they might tell you\nthat the NUS is the only student\nFormer ACC Chair Eric Lai argues that IC\u2019s clubs and societies have a lot to gain from voting No next week\norganisation involved with the 2012\nOlympics, so we\u2019d better affiliate to\nget involved. Lets not forget that\nBritish University Sports Association, which we affiliate to, have\nbeen involved from the start.\nFinally, they\u2019ll say how much\nbetter our student media could be\nwith the support they can provide\n\u2013 they\u2019ve even launched their own\nstudent media awards. All this for\nonly \u00a352,000!\nBut this is an argument for the\nNO campaign, so there must be a\ncatch. According to the Association\nof Managers in Students\u2019 Unions:\nper head, Imperial College Union\nis one of the best funded unions in\nthe country. We have more clubs\nand societies than any other un-ion, and our sports clubs are active\nand successful. But there is always\nroom for improvement, \u00a352,000\ncould give our clubs that extra bit\nof funding that could make all the\ndifference.\nSport Imperial are also involved\nwith the 2012 Olympics and have\nbeen so from the beginning. This\nyear the College and the Union\nhave set up a Sports Federation,\nbringing in a new staff member\ndedicated to sport and using College\u2019s resources to strengthen our\nsports clubs. We have the resources of a juggernaut with half a billion\npounds of turnover per year at our\ndisposal for sport. The NUS has a\nturnover of less than \u00a34m \u2013 less, in\nfact, than ICU itself.\nI\nt\u2019s funny to think that a little\nless than two years ago I was\nin the middle of a bitter battle with the NUS to \u2018save\u2019 Edinburgh from becoming one\nof its faceless members, and now\nI\u2019m writing an article in support of\na YES vote. I feel a little bad to be\nhonest, a bit like I\u2019m somehow betraying someone or something, but\nwhat really drives me is the knowl-edge, as a sabbatical, that joining\nNUS is the right thing to do.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m not\nsaying that NUS is a perfect or-ganisation. There are still faults\nwithin the juggernaut that is the\nNational Union. Decision-making\ncan still be dominated by factions,\nprocedures and processes are still\nbizarrely complex, organisation is\nstill unfeasibly poor, and communication is still not up to scratch.\nThese are all the things that I, as\nthe head of a NO campaign cannily entitled \u2018Students Against the\nNUS at Edinburgh (SANE!), campaigned on.\nBut what I wasn\u2019t really thinking\nabout (or rather, what I was shying away from at the time) was the\nfact that you can\u2019t reform something from the outside. You have\nto get into something to criticise\nit. There\u2019s absolutely no point in\nstanding on the sidelines shouting about how rubbish something\nis unless you\u2019re prepared to roll up\nyour sleeves and get involved. Yes\nNUS can be (at times) inefficient\nand a touch shady. No that doesn\u2019t\nmean we should dump it and move\non. NUS is reforming itself. We can\nonly influence that, and make sure\nit happens, if we are there. If Imperial joins now, you can all play\na massive role in reforming our\nnational union. That, of all things,\nshould be a draw.\nWhen I was running the NO camp\nin Edinburgh we spent a lot of time\ntalking about beer and discounts. I\nam convinced that the things that\nreally mattered to students during\nthe referendum were beer and dis-counts. If we joined, would they get\ncheaper beer? Would they be able\nto get student rate in clubs back\nhome? Would they get the blessed\nNUS discount card? But if you ask\nme now, none of those things really\nmatter.\nWhat does matter is what we are\ndoing as a student movement. The\ngovernment has scrapped grants\nand introduced loans, fees and\nvariable fees. This is a hard time\nfor higher education and we must\nall work together to fight for what\nis right. It\u2019s old, it\u2019s clich\u00e9d, but it\u2019s\ntrue: together we are stronger than\nThe NUS student media awards\nare all very well, but Imperial\u2019s student media is doing quite well by\nitself. Over the summer Stoic TV,\nour student TV station, won best\nbroadcaster at the National Student Television Awards. Felix has\nbeen short-listed in five categories\nat the Guardian Student Media\nAwards (and won two top awards),\nand IC Radio is in the running in\ntwo categories at the Student Radio Awards. There are plenty of\nawards open to all students, without the NUS having some of their\nown.\nNow for the money bit! Affiliation\nwill cost \u00a352,000 and we have 250\nclubs. That\u2019s an average of \u00a3208 per\nclub. It\u2019s also roughly the budget\nfor the whole RCC, the whole medics union or the following put to-gether: Arts & Ents Board, Media\nGroup, SCC, RSM, City & Guilds\nCollege Union and the Royal College of Science Union. Perhaps we\ncould give Cheese Society some\nmoney for Cheese in the process.\nOther options include employing\nadditional staff to reduce the workload of our volunteers, so they can\nspend more time running activities\nand less time doing paperwork.\nThe NUS Extra card also comes\nwith strings. I was recently at University of Westminster which has\n25000 students and after a month\nthey have only sold 2000. Extra\nstaff had to be hired and new laptops had to be purchased to admin-Eric Lai\nTim Goodwin\n\u201cAffiliation will\ncost \u00a352,000 and\nwe have 250\nclubs. That\u2019s an\naverage of \u00a3208\nper club\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me\nwrong; I\u2019m not\nsaying that NUS\nis a perfect\norganisation\u201d\nister the scheme and we will probably have to do the same. Imperial\nstudents can get discounts at a lot\nof places including HMV, Odeon,\nVUE, Cineworld, and McDonalds.\nNUS are campaigning to get these\ncompanies to give exclusive discounts to NUS extra card holders.\nDo you really want to spend \u00a352,000\non a organisation that actively\ncampaigns against the interest of\nALL students?\nSince I started talking about their\ncampaigns, let\u2019s not forget about\nthe lecturers strike. The strike af-fectedthousandsofstudentsacross\nthe country, many have struggled\nto find jobs due to results or exams\nbeing late. Who was it that supported the strike? The NUS. They\nwould rather stick to their dogma\nthan act on behalf of thousands of\nstudents who faced the prospect\nof not being awarded their degree,\nendangering many conditional job\noffers. Were they aware that students were suffering?\nOne member of their executive\nwas. An emergency motion was tabled at the start of their conference\nbasically saying \u201cthis is important,\nlets talk about this first\u201d. The Conference voted against this, taking\nless than 30 minutes to reach their\ndecision. Do we really want to join\nthis bunch?\nLeaving ULU is no reason to\nwaste \u00a352,000, vote NO! to have\nmoremoneyavailableforyourclubs\nand societies this NO!vember.\nPresident of Edinburgh University Students Association and former NUSceptic Tim Goodwin explains\nwhy his opinion changed, and why he now recommends that Imperial students vote Yes next week\nNow I\u2019m a believer \u2013 I\u2019d vote Yes!\nwhen we are apart. If we all come\ntogether to fight for our rights then\nwe stand a much better chance of\nwinning. If we remain fractured we\nwill get nowhere. That is how the\ngovernment has trodden on us for\nso long.

    "content": "I, Gamer\nW\nar, then. You\u2019d\nbe forgiven for\nthinking that\nFelix Games\nis choosing\nthemes by virtue of how easy it\nis to write comedic headlines for\nthem, but with Company of Heroes still holding its own in the\nUK charts, and Call of Duty 3\ncoming to consoles over the next\nfew weeks, war is on the mind of\nthe UK gamer once more.\nA lot of the time, realism in\ngames is a secondary issue. Does\na headcrab splat convincingly\nwhen hit with a crowbar in HalfLife 2? Have they really modelled\nthe walking mech suits correctly\nin Battlefield 2142? Designers often claim that \u2018if reality was that\nmuch fun, people wouldn\u2019t play\ngames,\u2019 but certain kinds of reality are very close to a gamer\u2019s\nheart.\nThankfully, I\u2019ve not experienced\nreal war yet. And unless some scifi prophecies start ringing true,\nit\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll ever have to take\nup arms for my country \u2013 or in-deed, my planet \u2013 in my lifetime.\nSo maybe when creating a game\nthat\u2019s as visceral and hard-hitting\nas Call of Duty 3, it\u2019s acceptable to\ngo for the easy shocks, to rewrite\nthe path of history with a few Hollywood set-pieces?\nOr maybe it\u2019s here that reality\nbecomes more important than\never. Because just as we struggle\nto record the experiences of war\nveterans before the last of them\npass away, we also have a duty\nto communicate them to new\ngenerations in an accurate way.\nWar shouldn\u2019t be a skip and a hop\nthrough the exciting parts, with\nthe trials and tribulations missed\nout. If we\u2019re not telling the story\nproperly, then we may as well\nnot tell it at all. There\u2019s a reason\nwhy people play Call of Duty over\nUnreal Tournament \u2013 they want\nreality.\nAnd it\u2019s this perhaps, more\nthan war, that is this week\u2019s fo-cus. With the release of Medieval\n2, real-time strategy and history\ntextbooks collide more beautifully than ever before.\nMaybe it\u2019s sad in some cases\nthat we\u2019re striving to put reality\nin games so that we don\u2019t have to\ngo out and live life for ourselves?\nIt\u2019s possible that that\u2019s what contributes most to the stereotype of\nthe reclusive gamer. But at the\nsame time, it\u2019s also so that we\ncan show to others what more\nterrible things are, without them\nhaving to go through the horror\nitself. Is that a good thing? Get in\ntouch.\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\nBoom, boom, boring boom\nWar games follow war games, but what is it good for, anyway, asks Michael Cook\nSilence, at first. The lapping of the\nsea against metal. Your first con-notation, as Gamer, is that of the\nseaside. The gentle summer. Without warning, we fade in to a seaside that definitely is not Brighton\npromenade.\nMaybe it was Half-Life fading in\npeople\u2019s memories, or maybe it was\nsimply the first-person shooter well\non its way to becoming the most\npopular genre in gaming. Whatever the reason, the Omaha Beach\nLandings in Medal Of Honor: Allied\nAssault became a defining moment\nfor videogaming this decade.\nWhilst watching a scientist get\nmauled by a team of scripted soldiers was one thing, having the\ntechnique used to tell a story of real\nsoldiers, real divisions, real events,\nwas something else entirely. Storyled gaming, in that moment, took a\nhuge leap forward.\nSkip a few generations of gaming\non, and World War Two seems to be\nstumbling somewhat. Call of Duty\ndoes D-Day, and\u2026 it\u2019s a bit like\nMedal of Honor. Call of Duty 2 does\nD-Day, and it\u2019s also a bit like Medal\nof Honor. But with more cliffs. Is\nWar still hell? Or has it just become\nmildly irritating?\nWorld War Two has a lot of stories on offer, and most development\ncompanies are good at finding new\nones to revisit. Call of Duty might\nreturn to the beaches of France,\nbut at least it had the decency to\nchange venue. Company of Heroes\nnot only gives us a different viewpoint \u2013 this time from a real-time\nstrategy context \u2013 but it also struggles to give a different feel to shooting members of the same army over\nand over again. Call of Duty 2 takes\nyou through Africa with the Desert\nTime to expand your sim-ple tastes\nThe add-on culture lives on with The Sims. But can it really go on for much longer?\nYou know what I like about cheese?\nI mean, there are plenty of things\nI like about cheese, don\u2019t get me\nwrong. The main thing I like about\nit is that when I\u2019ve bought some\ncheese, I know that the cheese is\ngoing to be there should I come and\nneed some. And I\u2019m vaguely aware\nthat I could make my own cheese\nusing a few simple ingredients,\nsome time, and some skill.\nTo leave the cheese metaphor\nat the roadside (I think we can all\nagree that it\u2019s done its bit), there\nare no expansion packs for cheddar.\nIf I want a different experience, or\nsomething new, or just more of the\nsame, then I go out and buy some\nmore cheese. No matter what I do,\nit\u2019s still the same dairy product.\nMaybe the availability of new\ngames is what\u2019s making us so bitter about the stream of expansion\npacks to The Sims and its sequel.\nOnce upon a time, expansion packs\nwere almost a necessity, they were\nexpected to come as the developers\nhad finished the hard task of coding\nand someone out there could actually sit down and design something\nfun and challenging. Art once again imitating life\nRats or drops you in the middle of\nthe defence of Russia. Pacific Assault in the Medal Of Honor series took us to the other side of the\nworld, breathing life into battles not\nseen or fought by gamers before.\nIt\u2019s interesting to look at Half-Life\n\u2013 often seen as the classic example\nof first-person gaming used to tell\nan emotive story \u2013 and consider\nwhy it and its successor had such\nan impact. What are the memorable segments of Half-Life 2? Is it the\ngun battles that were fought in the\nWater Hazard chapter? Is it fending\noff the army of headcrabs at the bottom of Ravenholm\u2019s mineshaft? Or\nare these experiences secondary to\nthe power of meeting Dog for the\nfirst time, to stepping out of the station at City 17 in the introductory se-quence, to seeing Alyx and Barney\nchat with each other and respond\nconvincingly? What you find is that,\nwhilst the fight sequences and the\nhigh-octane action was enjoyable,\nwe also remember the quiet moments as being just as important in\nterms of telling a story.\nAnd telling a story is what war\ngaming is about. Band of Brothers did nothing particularly new in\nterms of special effects when it was\naired on the BBC. But what it offered in comparison to Saving Private Ryan or A Bridge Too Far was\na feel of the evolution of a unit. The\nfallen soldiers didn\u2019t respawn at\nthe start of the next battle \u2013 something that crippled the immersion\nof Brothers In Arms. Nor were the\nnames just placeholders for real\nQuick! It\u2019s Generic Soldier 4 - and he\u2019s in trouble! Are we losing an emotive connection with our games?\npersonalities \u2013 you were witnessing\nreal men, the stories of people who\nwere still alive today to tell their\ntale.\nMaybe World War 2 is a theme\nthat can\u2019t be overdone. IL Sturmovik, Battlefield 1942, Medal Of Honor 2 \u2013 these games range from massively multiplayer, through to air\nsimulation. They cover topics from\nthe defence of Russia to the French\nresistance. Perhaps there is a variety available that can be exploited\nindefinitely. But unless developers\nsuch as Treyarch learn that explosions and accents alone don\u2019t make\na compelling experience, war gaming will remain just a game. Soon,\nthere won\u2019t be anyone left to point\nout the difference between reality,\nand our experience of it.\nBut then people decided that\nthey\u2019d rather have more. More\ngraphics advances, more sophisticated artificial intelligence, shorter\nproduction cycles, higher production values. Less controls, more\ncontrol. More to master, less to\nlearn. As the demands rose, the\nneed to constantly rejuvenate not\nonly the level design, but also the\ntechnology surrounding the game,\nbecame immense. Expansion\npacks were delayed by six months\nand turned into sequels, and soon\nthe practice of creating standalone\nmission packs became the reserve\nof epic role-playing games and\ngames which were cut short in the\nfirst place to meet release dates.\nUntil The Sims, of course.\nLivin\u2019 Large, House Party, Hot\nDate, Unleashed \u2013 at first, the\npacks seemed sensible. Then ob-scure. And then it was quite clear\nwho they were pandering to. Maxis\nhad found their target market like\na particularly obvious piece of Red\nLeicester in a vat of Stilton. Girls\nplayed the Sims. A lot of girls.\nAnd we\u2019re not generalising here;\nit\u2019s true to say that The Sims and\nThe Sims 2 has become a game\nlargely played by girl gamers. And\nas noted in Felix Science this is-sue, gaming demographics are a\ntricky business. It turned out that\nSims players didn\u2019t just want to\nbuy expansion packs for the hell of\nit. They also enjoyed the way it let\nthem play.\nExpansion Packs for games such\nas The Sims \u2013 a game without missions to speak of in the first place\n\u2013 means adding new items, occu-pations, abilities and things to see.\nIt\u2019s about expanding the game uni-verse, and giving the player more\nthings to tinker with. To most gam-ers, it seems like money-grabbing.\nBut to the community of The Sims\n\u2013 and as communities go, it\u2019s one of\nthe largest and most dedicated on\nthe net, churning out hundreds of\nuser-created bits and bobs each day\n\u2013 the expansion pack gives them\na way of customising their playing\nenvironment, and filling the toybox\nwith new things.\nYour average player won\u2019t like it.\nBut the way The Sims uses expansion packs is unique and brilliant.\nAt the end of the day, not even the\nmost suggestible gamer will play a\ngame that isn\u2019t fun. So the question\nis this \u2013 can 16.8 million gamers be\nthat wrong?\n32 felix Friday 10 November 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMatthew Keyes\n\n"

    "content": "First it was Nature, then New Scientist, and Scientific American, but\nso far so normal for a Science news\nstory. But when The Guardian, The\nNew York Times, and The Economist start running features on the\nsame subject, it\u2019s time to sit up and\ntake notice. But what is this big\nnews? What is iGEM? Felix delves\ninto the new field of synthetic biology to bring you perhaps the most\nexciting news this century.\niGEM (international Genetically\nEngineered Machine) is an annual\ncompetition for undergraduate scientists originally set up in order to\naddress a simple question. Can simple biological systems can be built\nfrom standard interchangeable\nparts and operated in living cells,\nor is biology is too complicated to\nbe engineered in this way?\nResearch of this kind falls under\nthe new \u2018synthetic biology\u2019 banner.\nWaclaw Szybalski of the University\nof Wisconsin believes this work represents the beginning of a new era\nin engineering and biology: \u201cThe\nwork on restriction nucleases not\nonly permits us to easily construct\nrecombinant DNA molecules and\nto analyse individual genes but also\nhas led us to a new era of synthetic\nbiology where not only existing\ngenes are described and analysed\nbut also new genes arrangements\ncan be constructed and evaluated.\u201d\nThis cutting edge area of research\nis a combination of engineering and\nbiology. Scientists unite to break\ndown biological systems into their\nconstituent parts and then engineer\nnew systems from them, much like\nthe components of a circuit are constructed within electronics. This allows the power of the cell to be harnessed and engineered to produce\nwide ranging results.\nDr. Kesling at the University of\nCalifornia is devising a way to syn-thesise artemisinin (an antimalarial\ndrug) cheaply. Currently this drug\nis extracted from a type of wormwood mainly found in china and\nproducing the chemical by standard\nchemistry is highly impractical due\nto the number of complicated steps\ninvolved, making the chemical ex-pensive. Armed with a $42.6 million\ngrant from the Bill and Melinda\nGates foundation, a partnership\nbetween Amyris Biotechnologies,\nthe Institute for OneWorld Health,\nand the University of California;\nKeasling is developing a method to\nuse cells as a \u2018factory\u2019 to produce\nartemisinic acid, which can then be\nconverted to artemisinin. The goals\nof synthetic biology are far reach-ing, including building biological\nsystems that process information,\nmanipulate chemicals, fabricate\nmaterials, produce energy, provide\nfood, maintain and enhance human\nhealth and the environment.\nOne such project is making cellu-Honey, I shrunk the technology\nlosic ethanol, used to produce carbon neutral fuels. At present this\nis produced by fermenting sugar\nand starch, but the process is inefficient due to yeast not being unable\nto digest the 100 per cent of mate-rial. However some species of fungi\nand bacteria can do this job and it is\nhoped by identifying the genes that\nenable them to do this job and reassembling them into a new pathway\nit will be possible to produce systems able to digest the whole plant.\nFor some synthetic biologists the\nproof of their field is not an artificial metabolic pathway but an artificial organism. This is precisely\nwhat the man who first sequenced\na whole organism\u2019s genome is planning to do. He believes he will be\nable to \u201csynthesise a working bacterial genome from scratch in two\nyears.\u201d Dr. Venter and Hamilton\nSmith are first creating a stripped\ndown bacterial genome at the Venter institute in Rockville. He has\nbeen scouring the oceans for bacterial genes, his current collection\nclocking in at 6 million.\nOf course this kind of science\ndoesn\u2019t come without it\u2019s risks. Currently the highest risk is a biohack-er or political terrorist using the\nmetabolic pathways to their own\nends. Another would be accidental\nescape of the organisms. \u201cNew organisms can\u2019t pass the exam of evolution any way. If they were released\nthey wouldn\u2019t survive in the natural\nworld,\u201d Vincent Rouilly reports. As\none of the seniors working on the\niGEM project he naturally defends\nthe developing and exciting field.\nThere is no risk-free technology, but\nsynthetic biology has an extra twist\n\u2013 the risks can breed. Currently the\nrisks are very low due to the lack of\nsurvivability of the pathways and\norganisms created in the lab. Naturally, as understanding grows, then\nso will the danger.\nScientists are\naware of\nthe risks\ninvolved and are promoting public\ndebate over the issues to prevent\nearly legislation.\nAs the field grows synthetic biology becomes more able to produce\nchemicals and organisms which\nwere previously hard to create or\nfind.

    "content": "reviews\nreleases\nOctopus Project/Black Moth Super\nRainbow\nThe House of Apples and Eyeballs\nHHHHI\nfemm\n5 Friday 10th November 2006\nTwo names separated by a slash tend to indicate that the record is a split; for the less\nsavvy among you, this is when broke bands\nget together and do a record together, cos\nit costs half as much. Like, duh. Anyway,\nthis isn\u2019t one of those. This is monster of a\ncollaboration.\nOur heroes; Texas-born many-piece The\nOctopus Project have been pitting man (gui-tar and live drums) against machine (fucked\nup synths and samples) since 2002\u2019s slightly\nmechanical Identity Parade, with the fol-low-up, 2004\u2019s One Ten Hundred Thousand\nMillion, seeing them finally get to grips on\nthe whole digital/analog thing. Black Moth\nSuper Rainbow are a somewhat elusive\ncollective from Pennsylvania, who\u2019ve been\nknocking out Boards Of Canada-inspired\nweirdness with their own unique psychedelic twist for a couple of years. This fantastically titled record is the baby of both\nbands, and (thankfully) takes each band\u2019s\nstrengths and combines them into some\nkind of ninety-foot-high nuclear-powered su-perband. No, I\u2019m not high. From Black Moth\nSuper Rainbow, we get crackling synths and\npretty melodies; The Octopus Project provide the perfect foil in the form of gorgeous\nlive drums and swathes of alternately beautiful and destructive guitar work.\nThe opener is signature Octopus styl-ing, all big chromatic synths and ferocious\ndrumming. What\u2019s new is the sense of re-straint; left to their own devices, TOP would\nprobably have mangled the thing beyond all\nrecognition under a metric ton of guitars (cf.\nMusic Is Happiness from One Ten Thousand..), BMSR bring an assload of synths to\nthe party to keep some melody in there.\nMarshmellow Window sounds like the\nBoC we all miss; wistful, tape-decayed analog burbles and snappy, distorted drum\nthumps. El Milq throws four seconds of\ngrinding noise at you, before morphing into\njazzy, cymbal-heavy drumming and delicate\nguitar work that could have come right off\nDo Make Say Think\u2019s excellent & Yet & Yet.\nLinking these tracks together are short yet\nfully-formed little experiments, bringing to\nmind the link pieces on BoC\u2019s seminal Music Has The Right To Children. Sometimes,\nhowever, these are deeply tedious, like the\npointless warble of Helium Tea, or the nonsensical noise of Copying Soup Onto Sexy\nBirdy (although that\u2019s an excellent song\ntitle).\nMy favourite track on here, if simply for\nthe sunshine-filled joyfulness of it, is Psychic Swelling. Coming on like The Go! Team\nin dayglo, the track rides the drummer\u2019s\nthumping, 60s soul-aping breakbeat and a\ndirty, unfiltered bassline, which the BMSR\ndudes throw a cheekily cute little melody\nover the top that ends up being thunder-ously backed up by a shedload of classic Octopus guitar noise.\nIt\u2019s rare that you get collaborations that\nplay upon the strengths of both sets of artists involved, and even rarer that the resulting collaboration sounds better than the\nrecords each individual group has put out,\nthe usual result being that the record sounds\nlike it was written by committee. With this\nwork, though, it\u2019s hard to tell where one\nband starts and the other begins, and certainly going to back to each individual band\u2019s\nwork it becomes clear how close they were\naesthetically to begin with. That\u2019s probably\nwhy this record succeeds, and does so in excess of anything I was expecting. Along with\nthe Clark record I\u2019ve been spinning for the\nlast month, this is going on my \u201ckeeps from\n2006\u201d list.\nAndy Sykes\nIsis\nIn The Absence of Truth\n(Ipecac Recordings)\nHHHHH\nEmerging from the Boston scene in the late\nnineties, Isis took a slightly different path\nfrom most of their contempories, infusing\ndoom-metal influences into hardcore punk\nto make a new brand of music, widely referred to as \u2018post-metal\u2019, although I like to\nthink of them simply as representing a more\naggressive offshoot of post-punk. Whatever\nyou want to call them, I\u2019m afraid this album\nhasn\u2019t made it any easier, but what can be\nagreed on is that this is Isis\u2019 first serious\nstab at making an impact on the main-stream, erm, alternative scene.\nAh, a sell-out album you say! Well no, actu-ally. For sure, \u2018true\u2019 metal fans may feel that\nthis album is a bit of a let-down, and there\u2019s\nno denying that the crushing distortion and\ngrowled lyrics experienced on their past\nreleases has given way to more reverb and\nsullen crooning. Not the greatest voice in the\nworld, (and I wish they had used more of the\nfemale singing that gave Oceanic such an\nepic feel) but it fits the rhythm-heavy mixing\nand the effectively deliberate drowned-out\nfeel. The keyboard usage has gone up, but\nthat industrial sound on their early material has morphed into oft spaced-out, modern progressive rock; complete with more\npretentious sounding song titles and jazzy\ninterludes. The gravitas is still there; this is\nby no means a happy record, but still a more\naccessible one. Much in the same way with\nthe last Opeth record, this may be Isis-light,\nbut it\u2019s still Isis nonetheless.\nSo then, this is unashamedly an alt-rock\nalbum, with catchy riffs galore, and the long\nshoe-gazing instrumentals given their own\ntracks on the CD. The concept album idea\nused in earlier albums seems to have gone\nmore or less out the window. But like everything else they\u2019ve released, this is still a\nbeautiful record (and in an acceptable form\nto more casual rock fans). Of course, it\u2019s also\na brazen grab for Tool\u2019s fan base, whom incidentally they are opening for in the good old\nUS of A. And somehow, they have managed\nto beat Tool\u2019s 10,000 Days with an album\nthat mixes angst and maturity in perfect\nmeasure.\nAlex McKitrick\nIf Cassie is guilty of one thing it is making irresistibly catchy urban pop. Me&U seduced\nus with its minimal yet dangerous production and now the repetitive horn loop on\nLong Way 2 Go was sent from pop heaven\nto drive us out of our already overloaded\nminds.\nLong Way 2 Go doesn\u2019t hint at further vocal ability or deep and meaningful lyrics\nbut careers have been made on less. Janet\nJackson, for instance, isn\u2019t considered an\namazing chanteuse and gets away with\nspeak-singing/moaning on her records, but\nshe indisputably deserves every hit she\u2019s\nhad.\nSimilarly, Cassie\u2019s music isn\u2019t about to\nchange anyone\u2019s life anytime soon but then\nagain we really shouldn\u2019t expect that from a\nfemale model who has just turned 20.\nOne person who also deserves a mention\nis her talented collaborator/beat-maker,\nRyan Leslie, who is responsible for inspired\nproduction on both singles and most of the\nmaterial on her self-titled debut album. We\nneed to appreciate the producers that still\nCassie\nLong Way 2 Go\n(Bad Boy)\nHHHHI\nsingle review\nalbum reviews\nDuring my time at Imperial I have met\nsome people with exceptional music\ntastes. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of being subjected to the old Alt Music Soc\u2019s scorn in\nmy first year (the Alt Music Soc is now\nvery accepting and friendly, thank god\nthat\u2019s changed), I\u2019ve experienced Matty\u2019s hairy music editor love, as well as\nthat of his predecessors. I\u2019ve got naked\nat Panic! @ the Roxy, and tried my best\nto look cool at Trash, I\u2019ve seen Bloc Party\nin fancy dress on Halloween and I\u2019ve been\ndisturbed by Liars wearing nightdresses,\nbear gloves and lycra. But something I\nam always picked up on is my brutal ignorance of \u2018old\u2019 music.\nNow to me \u2018old\u2019 pretty much means before 1995, the oldest band I listen to are\nRadiohead. People have almost killed me\nin the past for not listening to Nirvana,\nHendrix, Dylan, anything from the 80s,\nMotown, The Beatles, Classic Rock, Prog\n(the first time round), Glam, Led Zepplin,\nThe Who, Ska etc. It\u2019s just one of my many\ncharming idiosyncracies.\nBut now that it\u2019s been six years since\nI first obsessively followed a band, and\nthree whole years since I started uni, I\nfeel that I actually can look back on some\nbands with nostalgia and inspire some of\nyou who are more open minded than me\nto look them up.\nI am going to start with my favourite\nindie-pop band of all time, with their best\nalbum. I am talking about Easyworld, and\ntheir debut This is where I stand. Two boys\nand a girl, one giant ego, one high pitched\nvoice, one EP and two albums, a trail of\nfairy-wing wearing teenage girls crying\nat the split, this is their legacy. Granted,\nsongwriter and front man Dav Ford now\nhas a solo career, but Easyworld are definitely dead.\nThe band stuck to their winning formula\nof guitar/keyboard, bass and drums for\ntheir debut. The album begins with Dav\ngrowling and sighing, before breaking\ninto one of the goddamn happiest songs\nI\u2019ve ever heard Try not to think. We\u2019re\ntalking upper register three part harmonies of loud, cheerful power chords, and\nlyrics like \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I just,\nloooooove everything about you\u201d. It was\nbeing 16 for me.\nBut Easyworld\u2019s music was decidedly\nbittersweet. Who can forget the almighty\ncry of \u201cYou make me want to drink bleeeeaaaaaccchh!\u201d at the beginning of Bleach,\nwhich also contains one of my all time favourite phrases, \u201cChoke on happy, drown\nin joy\u201d. In fact the whole album is less\nabout love, more about women making\nDav feel so depressed and belittled he just\nwants to lay down and give up.\nThe whole album is brilliant. It\u2019s loud,\nupbeat, lyrically vicious and just so young!\nI love it, you\u2019ll love it. It has so many clas-sics, Junkies and Whores brings me to the\nverge of tears every time I hear it, and You\n& Me oozes fuck-you cool. It\u2019s a shame the\nband self destructed under not wanting to\nplay Bleach (so damn selfish - Ed) every\nnight. Oh well, such is life. Check it out,\nand if you know me I definitely won\u2019t make\nyou a copy.\nJames Millen\nbring the heat at a time when even Pharrell is shooting blanks.\nMaybe Cassie does get a bit more credit\nthan she should for the doing not very\nmuch at all but if the music is this good\nshe must be doing something right.\nJemil Salami\nEasyworld\nThis Is Where I Stand\n(BMG/Jive)\nclassic album\n\n"

    "content": "Dawn of a gaming revolution\nWhilst you might hear plenty about\ngaming\u2019s conquering of the mass\nmarket and its final acceptance by\nthe majority \u2013 indeed, you may even\nhear it from Felix\u2019s own games section \u2013 it isn\u2019t quite that simple. Yes,\nplenty of people play games, but\nare plenty of people gaming? Felix\ntalks to Owain Bennallack, editorial\ndirector of gaming website PocketGamer.co.uk, about gaming and its\nacceptance in society. Are we all actually playing along?\nWhat do you think of the Game\nOn exhibition as a kind of turning\npoint in gaming\u2019s acceptance?\nI haven\u2019t actually been to the latest Game On, but I think it\u2019s a good\nidea. I went to the original one back\nin the Barbican, and it\u2019s interesting to see an art institution behind\nsomething like that. I think people\nhave been talking about games in\na cultural sense for some time, but\nit was definitely an interesting moment \u2013 perhaps turning point is a bit\nstrong, but important nevertheless.\nDo you think that the exhibition is\nmore about the past then, or the\nfuture?\nWhenIwalkaroundtheScienceMuseum, I think about the future. What\nit does is it illuminates the present,\nin the same way that science fiction\ndoes. Even though you\u2019re looking at\nsomething like Defender, and then\nGhost Recon, you\u2019re being made\naware that this medium that was\nseen as quite quirky and hidden is\nactually following a timeline of its\nown, and there\u2019s no reason it\u2019s not\ngoing to keep progressing.\nYou\u2019re a fan of Guitar Hero?\nDefinitely a fan of the idea, I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019m any good at it though!\nWhat do you think gives it, and\ngames like it, such an appeal?\nWell I think it\u2019s interesting in general when you marry a real world\nMike Cook\nFelix talks to Owain Bennallack from Pocket Gamer about a whole new gaming world\nartefact to gameplay. It can never\nbe underestimated how much people are turned off by joysticks and\nkeyboards. If you talk to a non-gam-er and ask them if they want to play\na game, they might say no. But if\nyou ask them if they want to dance\non a dancemat, or shake maracas,\nor hold a guitar and play it, they\u2019ll\nsay: \u201cYeah, of course, because I\nknow how to play a guitar.\u201d They\ndon\u2019t want to go and learn how to do\nsomething, they just want to have\nfun. Everyone gets music, and everyone can instantly relate to something like Guitar Hero.\nThe controller on the Nintendo\nWii is something quite simplified\ntoo. Is that a sign that there\u2019s\nsome realisation of this?\nYou really can\u2019t go simple enough.\nThe Wii controller is, to an extent,\na barrier of its own. But it\u2019s more\nintrinsically fun too, because you\u2019re\nfollowing around with its actions\nsomewhat. I mean, bemused girls\n\u2013 bemused gamers \u2013 are going to\nwant to play a backhand on the Wii\ntennis games, and they won\u2019t be\nable to because of the way it works.\nIt\u2019s still a step forward.\nThe girl gamer demographic definitely seems like the biggest target\nfor companies to grab.\nThe problem the industry has in\ngeneral is that people get into gaming when they\u2019re young males, and\nit becomes a flatter consumption as\nthose gamers get older. So to keep\nthe market expanding, you\u2019ve got\nto look for new demographics. But I\nthink there\u2019s something inherently\nmasculine about the existing game\nmechanics \u2013 learn to beat this, overcome this challenge, be rewarded\nwith something that helps you get\non. There will be gamers that disagree with that, but I think it\u2019s an inherently masculine mindset.\nBut in many ways, this is an old\nissue. There are stats now that Nintendogs has sold in Germany and in\nthe UK, around 50% of those many,\nmany copies to women.\nThere was a time when you could\ntell you were in a highbrow discussion if someone mentioned the\nword \u2018demographic\u2019 and \u2018gaming\u2019\nin the same context. Gaming was\nits own demographic \u2013 there wasn\u2019t\nso much a supply and demand\nrelationship as there was a parasitic one. Gamers waited for the\ngames, and then when they arrived\nthe gamers would play them and\nwait for more games. Nowadays\nit seems \u2013 for financial reasons or\nother \u2013 that demographics is one of\nthe bigger puzzles in gaming.\nAs part of the Science Museum\u2019s\nongoing events schedule, Nicolas\nRodriguez from Kuju Studios gave\na talk last week entitled \u201cDancemats And Joysticks \u2013 Who\u2019s Playing Now?\u201d In it, he charted the rise\nand development of game control\nmechanisms, and talked about the\nbarriers that were now set up to\nnew gamers. \u201cIn the past, gaming\nwas simple,\u201d he explains, flicking\nup a simple button-and-paddle system onto a projector, \u201cyou move the\npaddle, you press the button and\naliens die.\u201d\nThe important thing, Rodriguez\nsays, is that we understand what\nwe\u2019re doing. \u201cThere\u2019s a one-to-one\nrelationship between what we do\nwith a controller and what happens\non the screen. That\u2019s why games\nlike Guitar Hero work. You tell people they have to play the guitar, give\nthem a peripheral and\u2026\u201d he mimes\na few power chords on a well-mod-elled air guitar, \u201c\u2026they know what\nto do.\u201d\nCrucially, he explains, the reason\nthat the games industry doesn\u2019t see\nthe problem is because they grew\nup with the problem. Keyboards\nand joysticks aren\u2019t just techniques\nthat the industry has got used to,\nit\u2019s something that is genuinely\nthought of as the best solution.\nSteel Battalion\u2019s release in both the\nEasternandWesternmarketscame\nwith the largest controller known to\ngamers at the time, with around\n40 buttons and two joysticks. But\nas Rodriguez explains, part of the\ngame becomes the control system\nitself. And mastering it is not something many gamers want to do.\n\u201cWhat I want to ask is: has the\ncontroller become a barrier to innovation and new gamers?\u201d\nIt seems like a distinct possibil-ity. The key problem \u2013 picked up\nby many others in the industry \u2013 is\nthat gaming got too obsessed with\nitself, and with its romantic notion\nof sweaty teenagers in their bed-rooms. Far from being something\nthey shied away from, they embraced it. There was a thrill in the\nhard-core, the complicated. Joysticks became glorified, and t-shirts\nnow bear the long strings of button\ncombinations from famous game\ncheat codes.\nBut as time goes on, it comes\naround to bite gaming in the rear.\nThe key is to get people who\naren\u2019t gaming into this market\nIs that a misnomer then? Is there\nonly one type of \u2018gamer\u2019, or are\nwe looking at different kinds of\nplayers?\nAlready you can see the market\nfragmenting for traditional games\n\u2013 people who play FPSs don\u2019t necessarily want to go out and play\nplatform games. In the past, two\npeople with an Atari 2600 would\nhave played similar games. But as\ngames diversify, Quake fans are\nnow a world away from Singstar\nfans. They\u2019re different audiences,\nand they all want different things\nfrom a game. The main issue is to\nget people who can think in new\nways to make games.\nFelix Science has a pair of tickets\nfor the Game On exhibition to give\naway. To win them, be the first\nperson to email science.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk with the answer\nto the following incredibly tough\nquestion:\nWhich games website does Owain\nBennallack currently edit?\nIs it finally game over for the fat controller?\nToo inaccessible? The infamous Steel Battalion controller\nEx-Felix editor Owain Bennallack from 1994-5 (right) and now (above)\nA biog\nOne of just three Europeans\nplaced in a recent top 50 Most\nInfluential Games Journalists\nsurvey by Next Generation,\nOwain Bennallack started his\ncareer at Future Publishing.\nHe soon moved on to a stint\nas deputy editor of videogame\nculture giant Edge, before specialising in the games development side of the industry.\nOwain edited the European\ndeveloper magazine, Develop,\nfrom its inception in 2001 until\nFebruary 2006, leaving to set\nup publishing company Steel\nMedia. Now running PocketGamer.co.uk, a site dedicated\nto handheld and mobile gam-ing, he also chairs the Develop\nIn Brighton Conference advisory board, and still finds time\nfor consultancy projects with\nseveral leading developers and\ngames publications.\nOwain\u2019s first experience of\njournalism however was here\nat IC, where he cut his teeth on\nFelix. Spurning the fourth year\nof his Computer Science de-gree, he was Felix editor 1994-5, which in those days also\nmeant running and in-house\nprinting press business, with\nfull-time staff. He considers the\nwhole experience \u2018absolutely\nvaluable\u2019 and points out that his\nimmediate IC media contemporaries include BBC TV presenter Declan Curry and New\nScientist features editor David\nCohen, plus a host of others\nwho now work as freelance or\nstaff editors and journalists.\nMike Cook\n5\nfelix\nFriday 10 November 2006\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nwhich is still a newcomer at only a\nfew decades old. But as you do that,\nthe market changes. Is the aim to\nbring new gamers into old hobbies,\nor to create a different kind of gam-er? Rodriguez thinks that the solution comes in getting people to try\nthe medium out. \u201cPeople move on.\nThey might start on Nintendogs,\nbut they\u2019re going to end up playing\nTrauma Centre and other games.\u201d\nRodriguez sums up the division\nquite neatly, against the backdrop of\na painting of a street, with children\nskipping and playing ball games.\n\u201cSome of us don\u2019t want to game,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cSome of us just want to\nplay.\u201d\nWith the next generation of gaming on our doorstep, those people\nmay have more opportunities than\never. But it\u2019s still a topic of discus-sion, and one that the Science Museum and Game On hope to consider over the coming weeks, as they\ndiscuss the psychology, the brand\nnames and the challenges of modern gaming.\n\n"

Already, some vice-chancellors and rectors, including\nImperial\u2019s very own Richard Sykes,\nare lobbying for this cap to be raised\n\u2013 or even lifted altogether.\nThis term, NUS mobilised over\n10,000 students from across the\nUK for a national demonstration\nand rally in central London. This\nis not the centre-piece of our battle\nto prevent the lifting of the cap, it\nis merely the beginning. Over the\nnext three years we will be building\nthe research, evidence and arguments we will need to win, building in our campaigning action with\na focussed, strategic and targeted\nlobbying campaign that will see\nthe inboxes and mailboxes of every\nPeer and Member of Parliament\nfull in the run up to the crucial parliamentary vote in 2009.\nImperial students need to be\nclear: a full market in Higher\nEducation will damage access to\nImperial College more than most\nplaces. Your rector has already\nmade it clear that he will charge as\nmuch as he can to generate more\nincome. NUS argues that Imperial\nneeds additional funding to remain\na world class scientific institution;\nNUS does not argue with variable\nfunding for institutions, but we do\noppose variable fees for students.\nThere are other challenges facing the education sector. Over the\nnext two years I will be sitting on\nthe Universities UK delivery partnership steering group, bringing\ntogether stakeholders from across\nthe education sector, to fundamentally reform and reshape the Higher Education admissions system.\nJust another national body NUS\nattends; but with it, the chance to\nimplement a post-qualification application system that will radically\nlevel the playing field to ensure\nthat every applicant to university is\ntreated fairly.\nWe have also been playing a leading role in the reform of the degree classification system, quality\nassurance mechanisms and have\nboard seats on the Quality Assurance Agency, Higher Education\nAcademy and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator.\nAll of this work nationally, has a\ndirect impact on students locally.\nOnly by being members of NUS can\nyou shape it.\nSome in this referendum campaign will argue that ICU doesn\u2019t\nneed NUS, that its parent body is\nprestigious enough to guarantee\nF\nrom the very first day at\nUniversity I was disap-pointed. Not because I\nhad joined a University\nrenowned for its poor\nmale: female ratio and its fake\nethos of \u201cWork hard, work harder\u201d\nbut for the fact that we were not\npart of the NUS.\nAt the time I did not know of the\nhistory behind IC\u2019s link with the\nNUS or realised it was something\nwe had to pay to join. For me and\nmy post sixth form mind, NUS\nmeant one thing and one thing\nonly\u2026discounts!\nI believe that it is this very point\nthat our students, especially our\nnew freshers, associate the NUS\nto. For many years I have felt\nthe bitter rejection of my Imperial College swipe card at the tills\nand the situation is only getting\nworse! Only last week at Subway\nsandwiches, the very staple diet\nof many a student, began to enforce discounted prices on those\nbearing the NUS card only. How\ndare they prevent me from enjoying a toasted BMT at a cut price!\nYet, if we are not members of the\nclub we cannot reap the benefits.\nYes, HMV and Virgin have begun\nto tackle this problem by creating their own student cards but\nI would rather carry one single\ncard than a card for every single\nstore I go to.\nI hate to think of the amount we\ncould have saved throughout our\nstudent lifetime, if we had access\nto the card sooner? This fact is\nnow becoming more important for\nour new cohort of students as they\npay tuition fees currently at nearly four times the amount set a few\nyears ago. Imagine the situation\nfor medical students or those continuing with their studies\u2026over\nfive years of financial pain.\nThe card is just one aspect of\nthe NUS, what about their repre-sentation? Let me now refer to\nTom Page\u2019s article in Felix on the\n3rd of November. His experience\nat the National NUS conferences\npaints the organisation as farce\nwith members there for their own\npolitical gains. This maybe true,\nbut surely with a force such as\nImperial College attending these\nconferences as well as a new look\nNUS system in place, things can\nonly get better.\nI strongly believe that Imperial\nneeds to be part of a support network and cannot afford to stand\nalone after we leave ULU. The\nNUS will also aid our relationship\nwith the British Medical Association (BMA), as the NUS provides\nstrong representation for medical\nstudents within the BMA. Last\nyear it seemed that the BMA were\nnot supporting London medical\nschools in the recent job application scheme. More direct links\nto the organisation will create a\nstronger voice for Imperial and\nLondon at a national level.\nYes the NUS will cost, but it costs\nless than ULU which we\u2019re leaving and frankly we get more for\nour money. The NUS has its faults\nlike any organisation but Imperial\nbeing part of the group will only\nstrengthen it and more impor-tantly, strengthen us. So vote for\nrepresentation, vote for savings\nand vote for a stronger Imperial!\nVote Yes on November 14th.\nWes Streeting\n\u201cImperial\nstudents need to\nbe clear: a full\nmarket in Higher\nEducation will\ndamage access\nto Imperial\nCollege more\nthan most\nplaces\u201d\nNo marketisation, says NUS\nthat the voice of Imperial\u2019s students\nwill be heard anyway. As a former\npresident of Cambridge University\nStudents\u2019 Union I can tell you from\nexperience that from the press\n(where it matters less), to the education sector and government decision makers (where it matters\nmore), NUS is the only body with\nthe collective clout to make a difference and affect policy change. NUS\nis the only show in town.\nSome in this referendum campaign will argue that ICU doesn\u2019t\nneed NUS, that its membership\nof the Aldwych Group (students\u2019\nunions of the Russell Group) can\nguarantee you a national voice\nwithout the need for NUS affilia-tion. As a former chair of the Aldwych Group I can tell you from experience that as a body for bringing\nsimilar students\u2019 unions together\nto share common experiences it\u2019s\na useful forum, but in the media\nand within the education sector, it\nbarely makes an impact. NUS is\nthe only body with representation\nin the right places to make a difference and affect policy change. NUS\nis the only show in town.\nIn the faces of the challenges\nahead, you need a strong national\ncampaigning voice to represent\nyou on the issues that matter. We\nwant you to play your part at the\nforefront of the largest student\nmovement in the world. Vote YES\nto the NUS.\nI\n\u2019ll get my own personal opinion on the referendum off my\nchest first. I urge you all to go\nout and vote NO! next week.\nI think that affiliating would\nbe a huge mistake and a poor use\nof the limited resourses we have.\nWhat both sides of this debate seem\nto agree on is that the NUS needs\nreform. The only quibbling seems\nto be over our ability to drive this\nchange. The starry-eyed Yes! camp\nseem to think that the addition of\n12,000 of us will result in massive\nchanges. Naturally, my colleagues\nand I from The A-NUS Coalition are\nsomewhat more sceptical about the\ninfluence that Imperial will have in\nsuch an inefficient monolith.\nHowever, no-one has said what\nthey mean by reform. I have a funny feeling that some might class it\nas renaming the influential Labour\nStudents faction as \u201cNew\u201d Labour\nStudents. The more I have studied\nthe NUS the more horrified I have\nbecome with how useless an organisation it is in its current form but\nI do recognise that it has potential.\nWho wouldn\u2019t want a strong national student body that was effective in\nrepresenting us? I don\u2019t want you to\nthink that A-NUS are pessimistic,\nso im going to lay out my main concerns with the NUS and what could\nbe done to address them.\nThe main problem with the NUS\nis that it is dominated by factional\ninterests. This is what happens\nwhen you put a load of people who\nare politically inclined in one room.\nThey seem to feel the need to gang\nup along religious or party political\nlines (you get the odd independent,\nbut they always have to attract support from one of the large groups,\nthe so-called \u201cIndependent\u201d President only won because of the support she secured from Labour\nStudents). In the age of online vot-ing, why do we need to have NUS\nOfficers elected by only those who\nattend conference? To me, the NUS\nmethod will only result in officers\nand policies even further alienated\nfrom the people they purport to rep-resent. Why not open voting on senior officers to all students? Surely\nthis is far more democratic than\nletting a handful of self-interested\npoliticians pick \u201ctheir\u201d person?\nNow that we don\u2019t have lackeys\npropped up by some incredibly fashionable left-wing pressure group in\ncharge we can consider problem\nnumber two The NUS represents\nfar too large a cross section of stu-dents. Most affiliates are sixth-form\nor FE colleges. Do they not get pissed off with them banging on about\ntop-up fees all the time? I, somewhat flippantly, asked a member of\nthe Yes! campaign what exactly Imperial College had in common with\na lot of the other NUS members, his\nreply was \u201cwe are all exempt from\ncouncil tax\u201d (one of the historical\nachievements of the NUS, sad thing\nis they have done so little since they\nare still parading it as an example\nof a triumph). Whilst he is spot on,\nthis is hardly a massive overlap.\nPerhaps he could have followed up\nwith \u201coh, and we all use pens and\npencils?\u201d The current grouping is\njust too large for it to be an effective lobbying group for us. The NUS\nmust spit into independent HE and\nFE bodies.\nAnother elephant in the room\nis that the NUS has not come to\nterms with devolution in the UK.\nAs a proud Scotsman it pains me\nto say that it needs to tell the Scots\nto go home. There is no more need\nfor delegates from Scottish unions\nto attend National Conference than\nthere is for delegates from a foreign country now that education\npolicy is now the responsibility of\nthe parliament in Edinburgh. A student in London needs to speak to\nWestminster, a student in Glasgow\ndoes not. End of story. I suspect the\nonly reason that my countryman\nare allowed to stay is because senior NUS officers love to grandstand\nto students in disaffiliation referendums that they \u201crepresent 5 million\nstudents.\u201d This is just another example of the NUS being more about\npolitical ego-stroking than ordinary\nstudents. As a staunch (British)\nunionist it is funny saying this but\nNUS Scotland should break away\ncompletely.\nNow the creative destruction of\nthe NUS is complete. We have 4\nseparate bodies, two north of the\nborder with these parts enjoying far\ngreater influence than the whole.\nThe NUS will only be effective if it\nhas the respect of students and po-liticans. At the moment I suspect\nthat both groups consider it to be\na laughing stock. So vote NO! and\nsend them homewards to think\nagain. If they grow up I might consider voting Yes in the future, but\nonly if the new HE-England NUS\ndosen\u2019t have the cheek to charge for\nuse of its discount card. Vote NO!\nSelf-destruct, then we\u2019ll join the NUS\n\u201cIf they grow up\nI might consider\nvoting Yes in the\nfuture, but only\nif the new HEEngland NUS\ndoesn\u2019t have the\ncheek to charge\nfor use of its\ndiscount card\u201d\nVote Yes to\nNUS, says\nShiv Chopra\n12 felix Friday 10 November 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nStephen Brown\n\n"

    "content": "King\u2019s dethroned on their own soil\nWith the season starting to shape\nup having come off the back of two\nconvincing wins, it was in Berryfrikkin-far-lands, to face King\u2019s 6ths\nthat Mooknellay\u2019s entourage would\ndiscover the impact our celebrity\nstatus would have on the division,\nand perhaps answer the eternal\nquestion \u201cWhere the fuck are we?\u201d\nThe game started crisply as\nKing\u2019s were eager to impose their\nauthority. To be fair, it was KCL\nwho were quicker to close down in\nmidfield and were prepared to be\nmore physical in their approach,\ngetting so tight on occasions there\nwas barely a layer of latex separating any two players. This effectively\nlimited our opportunities with the\nnearest coming via a measured ball\nfrom a corner which Jo headed just\nwide of the upright. Much of the\nplay revolved around our defense\nwith goalkeeper Mike Pursey and\ndefenders Jo, Ricky, Peter and Tony\nshowing discipline and resolve to\nnullify the mounting pressure.\nThe game eventually descended\ninto a bit of a scrap with the only\nhighlight of the first half being the\narrival of a cat pouncing from the\nshrubs by the end of the pitch to\nsavagely maul a bird. With the desire to redeem a disappointing 45\nminutes we took this as an omen\nof things to come for we too have\nbeen known to prey on fine birds\nand we too are familiar with pussies concealed within dense bush\n(with the exception of Fuge, whose\nantics last Christmas revealed he\nprefers to be ridden by a Brazilian),\nand we too belong at the top of the\nfood chain with the small exception\nof the referee.\nWhether it was down to a lack\nof fitness surfacing in the opposition or the discipline and quality\nwithin our own team I cannot say,\nbut such was the dramatic change\nin the second half that saying it was\n\u201ca game of two halves\u201d would be\nabout as big an understatement as\nsaying the phrase \u201ca game of two\nhalves\u201d is a clich\u00e9. Philipp \u201ca pun is\ntoo obvious\u201d Mania, who managed\nto cover more moss than Tampax,\nbegan combining well with James\nPlatt and Andriy \u201cShev\u201d Gelman,\nsecuring midfield supremacy. Our\npassing began caressing every\ncrevasse of the pitch as our play\npossessed the appeal often seen\non Page 3 with moves guaranteed\nto raise more cocks than a chicken\nfarmer and harden more nipples\nthan frostbite.\nThe deadlock was broken not long\nafter the restart when some neat attacking play down the centre drew\nout the keeper allowing Damien\nPhelan to drive a loose ball low into\nthe undefended net.\nThe momentum began to snowball as chances began appearing\nthick and fast. The next opportunity\narrived in the form of a cross from\nthe left flank by Shev leading to a\nscramble on the King\u2019s goal line before Nam lumbered along carrying\nthe grace of Borat in an antiques\nstore to bundle the ball across the\nline. Persistent moans, however,\nlead to suspicions that the ball from\nShev had actually curled out of play\nand that the keeper had two hands\non the ball before it was forced into\nthe goal.\nThe referee (a King\u2019s player), under heavy influence from the King\u2019s\ncaptain who appeared to have integrated his natural log to the ref in\nhis search for Brownian motion,\neventually conceded to demands\nand gave a goal kick.\nHowever, our revenge was swift\nwhen goal machine Shev was\nplayed in to fire a first time shot\npast the keeper for 2-0.\nAt this point King\u2019s looked as\nlikely to score as a non-6ths player\nwith the line \u201cGirl, you must have\nyeast, because I\u2019ve got a fire in my\npants and it\u2019s definitely giving rise\nto something!\u201d With King\u2019s showing about as much endurance as a\nBeckham haircut, it wasn\u2019t long before a short corner worked its way\nto the late arriving Philipp, to pull\noff a Zidane turn before producing a Lampard-esque chip from an\nimpossible angle which clipped the\nunderside of the bar and fell behind\nthe line for 3-0.\nKing\u2019s were given respite when\nPlatt\u2019s manoeuvre towards the\nball, which can only be described\nas \u2018beat the gypsy\u2019, induced cries\nof handball resulting in a penalty.\nUnfortunately for King\u2019s, Pursey\nmanaged to produce an outstanding save to deny their captain any\nconsolation and hold out for our\nthird successive clean sheet.\nShev was once again at the helm of\nour most prominent attacks when a\nneatly dinked ball in his direction allowed him to gently lift the ball over\nthe on rushing keeper capping off a\nmove which would have Kazakhstanis across the land exclaiming Wah\nWah Wee Wah! To conclude the goal\nrout, Hamish delivered a cleverly\nweighted through ball to the feet of\nAndriy who calmly slotted the ball\naround the advancing keeper, completing a hat-trick so fine, a 10 Gigapixel camera would\u2019ve had trouble\nmaintaining focus. Several further\nopportunities came our way with\nDamien hitting the bar on one oc-casion, meaning the 5-0 score line\nwas more a compliment to their defensive efforts.\nThe game ended abruptly when\nHamish\u2019s challenge for the ball was\nmet with another contesting fore-The IC 6ths probably waiting to devour some dim-witted blond with their extra manly ways\nAdLib by Tevong You\nWWW.TEVONG.CO.UK\nhead, which despite his eagerness\nto give head, lead to the Mook being\nescorted from the pitch suffering a\nbruised brow. Taking further meaning from the cat incident, our minds\nbegan scrolling through the pages\nof To Kill A Mocking Bird, prompting us to offer a sympathetic handshake and words of understanding\nwhilst bearing no hidden agendas\ntowards the generous post match\nplate of sandwiches we gratuitously\nwoofed down.\nTo summarize, our general ability to endure 45 minutes of foreplay\nand go on to last the full 90, plus\nour intricate knowledge of 11 different positions, means satisfaction is\nrarely denied, on and off the playing\nfield.\nNam Nguyen\nMen\u2019s Football\nKCL 6ths 0 \u2013 5 IC 6ths\npage 37\nCROSSWORD\nSUDOKU\nport\nS\n\n"

    "content": "In pursuit of the perfect boiled egg\nCooking + science + bald, domed foreheaded, self-confessed culinary alchemist = molecular gastronomy\nI have to begin this review with a\nwarning \u2013 watching In Pursuit Of\nPerfection could seriously titillate\nyour taste buds. This new eight-part cookery series features the\n\u2018flavour-of-the-month\u2019 chef Heston\nBlumenthal demonstrating how to\n\u2018perfect\u2019 everyday dishes, such as\npizza, spag bol, and fish and chips.\nThe secret \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 is\nscience. Blumenthal is a self-styled\n\u2018culinary alchemist\u2019 who practises\nthe art of \u2018molecular gastronomy\u2019.\nThis hi-tech approach to cooking is\nall about understanding how to pre-Edward Wawrzynczak pare and combine ingredients to\noptimise the way food looks, smells\nand tastes. Hold on, I can hear you\nask, isn\u2019t this what cooking has always been about? Well, yes \u2013 even\nBlumenthal admits that what he\ndoes is old-fashioned cooking with\na bit of science thrown in.\nAs the proprietor of The Fat\nDuck, which has been awarded\nthree Michelin stars and was voted\n\u2018best restaurant in the world\u2019 in\n2005, Blumenthal is famous for innovative dishes that bring together\nunexpected combinations such as\nsnail porridge and bacon-and-egg\nice cream. So you can figure out\nthat he is a seriously smart cook\nand not a man to trifle with.\nAnd, as you might expect, this\nprofessor of kitchen science has\nhis own laboratory with all kinds\nof experimental apparatus that\nwould not be amiss in the typical\nuniversity chemistry department.\nIndeed, he looks comfortingly bof-fin-like with his domed forehead,\nsafety goggles and thermal gloves.\nThe white uniform he wears is, of\ncourse, common to both kitchen\nand lab.\nIn pursuit of the perfect banger,\nBlumenthal and his team experimented to find the right combination of meat, casings, filler, spices,\nseasonings, flavourings, and preparation conditions. If I simply mention that you need to use pork thigh\nto retain moisture, oak-smoked\nback fat for the authentic barbecued taste, and water flavoured\nwith oven-toasted bread, you will\ngather that this is no ordinary cookery programme.\nIn fact, this programme is so extraordinary that it is difficult to\nfigure out who it is aimed at. The\nlab-concocted recipes are quite\nimpractical \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 for\nthe average cook. And the details\ndo not appear on the BBC website\nso that you will fail to reach sausage\nheaven, even if you are a dedicated\nchef, unless you buy the inevitable\nrecipe book.\nSeeing Blumenthal standing by\na gas chromatograph and sniffing\naromas \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m getting candyfloss,\nmolasses, even a slight \u2018figgy\u2019 note,\nalso a note of overripe banana\u201d\n\u2013 reminded me of those pompous,\nso-called expert pundits of the wine\nworld.

    "content": "Despite the name,\nit is actually quite\na nice little venue\nwhich is the size of\na living room. It is\na bit of a walk down\nsome back roads\naway from the\nmain Shoreditch\narea. They do however put on nice\nelectronic drone/noise shows on there with\nthe promoters called De Sonis, you have to\nget there early since the capacity is 50.\nLivin\u2019 it up in the east side\nfeature femm 10\nFriday 10th November 2006\nIt is full of art students, bad haircuts and\ntight-fitting garments. So naturally it is a hive\nfor numerous musos and brilliant, small gigs,\nFemm takes you on a magical journey through\nLondon\u2019s East End. We cover Shoreditch,\nBrick Lane and Hoxton; the epicentre of\nthe avant garde. Matty Hoban leads the\nexploration and confusion at the newly\ninvented \u2018New Rave\u2019 scene, which doesn\u2019t\nreally exist. There are also thousands of noise-rock shows and art galleries to choose from.\nE\nast London is synonymous with vibrance, diversity and contemporary\nculture. Where South\nKensington is cultured\nin a traditional and stuffy\nsense of the word. You\nwon\u2019t find many small\ngigs with exciting new music in the Royal\nBorough that often. I heartily suggest you\nget to know the other side of the Capital as\nsoon as possible. Here\u2019s a short guide of\nplaces where exciting things are happening at certain venues. This guide is done\nby postcode to break everything down.\nEC1\n333\n333 Old Street\nEC1V 9LE\nIt is essentially a nightclub for the art\nschool crowd who like their artful dance-noise. One of the places to have spawned\nthe so-called \u2018New Rave\u2019 scene as it has\nnights that play noise, avant garde mixed\nwithelectroandwhateveriscoolthatweek.\nIt\u2019s all a bit of fun really, just don\u2019t take it\nall too seriously. Go to www.333mother.\ncom for more information.\nEC2\nThe Old Blue Last\n39 Great Eastern Road,\nEC2A 3ES\nJust round the\nway from Old\nStreet station,\nthis dark pub\nhas a delightfully shabby\nupstairs which\nhosts many a\nfine show. Bands\nsuch as Foals\nwho are too electro for school have been playing their re-cently. Promoters such as Unluck Recs\nhave been putting on gigs with a slant towards noise recently. The Arctic Monkeys\nalso played here many a moon ago. The\nvenue has gained note for its cheap hire\ncost, so cheaper gigs, which can only be a\ngood thing.\nPlastic People\n147-149 Curtain Rd\nEC2A 3QE\nOnce home to the club night And Did We\nMention Our Disco but now that night no\nlonger exists. It has become a bit of a centre for the combination of repetitive dance\nrhythms and electro combined with guitars.\nGuitar music which you can dance to is not\na new thing but it was done especially well\nthere. You can have a look at what else they\nhave on at www.plasticpeople.co.uk.\nE1\n93 Feet East\n150 Brick Lane\nE1 6QL\nOn Brick Lane\nalong with a multitude of beigels, you\nwill find this venue.\nIt has a plethora\nof great music and\nhas a lovely outdoor\nbit on the cobbled\nstreets that Brick\nLane is renowned\nfor. It is a quite a big\ncomplex of rooms with a nice atmosphere as\ncan be seen on the website, www.93feeteast.\nco.uk, and you can take the virtual tour. The\nmusic is varied and can range from all varieties of the experimental.\nVibe Bar\nThe Old Truman Brewery, 91 Brick Lane\nE1 6QL\nAgain on the cobbled road that is Brick Lane\nyou can find in an old brewery yard, the entrance to the Vibe Bar. This venue has a\nmain room which has some sort of a stage\nand does look a bit yuppie. There is also a\nback room with some drapes and curtains.\nIt is an unusual venue in that it bears the\nappearance of somewhere to go listen to\n\u2018ambient\u2019 house, yet there have been some\nvery alternative shows put on there. Worth\na visit when there\u2019s a gig on, such as every\nthird Tuesday in the week when A Badge of\nFriendship bring their free shows of alternative and noise-rock.\nSpitz\n109 Commercial St\nOld Spitalfields Market\nE1 6BG\nA venue, bistro and\ngallery, Spitz can\nbe found to put on\nJazz acts to anti-folk in the upcoming Herman Dune\nshow. Probably a\nvenue that reflects\nthe cosmopolitan\nnature of the East\nEnd very well. Admittedly, I haven\u2019t been to many gigs at Spitz\nbut when I have been, I have enjoyed them\nimmensely and I found the atmosphere\nquite relaxing. Low are to play there early\nnext year, but it is already sold out, so it is\npretty pointless me telling you.\nGramaphone\n60-62 Commercial St\nE1 6LT\nI only recently discovered this bar with\nan underground venue. It again has a bar\nwhich looks like it is frequented by yuppies\nand bar prices reflecting their clientele. The\nvenue is quite nice and intimate but there\naren\u2019t many shows at their of note but when\nthere is, check it out.\nE2\nFleapit\n49 Columbia Road\nE2 7RG\nCatch\n22 Kingsland Road\nE2 8DA\nIt has a bit of a brown and bland exterior\nbut fear not as this boozer has been known\nto put on some very good shows. The nearest tubes are Old Street and Shoreditch. It\ncan be quite hard to find out what is going\non so just going there can be one of the\neasiest ways. However, if you have a snoop\naround enough you\u2019ll find that a lot of angular indie and alt-rock gigs can be found\nat Catch or Catch 22 as I (and a few other\nmisguided people) call it. It is part of the\nEast london show experience in my opinion as I do love guitar music.\nN1\nHoxton Bar and Grill\n2-4 Hoxton Square\nN1 6NU\nA pretty grim\nvenue if I\u2019m going to be honest.\nThis venue was\nnewly used by\nPlum Promotions who used to\nput on shows at\nthe Water Rats\nand put some\non at Betsey\nTrotwood. There will be the occasionally\ngood band playing but often it is ear-fod-der. This venue is for bands that are a bit\ngritty and could potentially be something\nbut still are stuck in the toilet circuit. So if\nyou want to see them whilst they\u2019re still\nsmall and then show off about it later, go\nto the Hoxton Bar and Grill.\nHoxton Bar and Grill\n2-4 Hoxton Square\nN1 6NU\nThe Macbeth has a lot of noise-rock and\nangular indie-rock shows organised by\nthe likes of Chaos Vs. Cosmos (the members of the band Collapse). It is also very\ngood for the odd free Sunday avant-garde\ngig with various arty ventures going on. I\nwish I went here more.\nBrick Lane where you can pick up some tasty, late night bagels\n\n"

    "content": "IPOs: when companies go public\nIf a company needs to raise cash,\nit does so by either borrowing (in\nthe form of loans or bonds) or selling portions of the company to in-vestors. These portions, known as\nshares (or equity), give the bearer\nownership of a part of the company\u2019s assets and profits.\nA company wishing to issue\nshares for the first time must do\nso in an Initial Public Offering or\nIPO. This is the act of floating, and\nmakes privately owned companies\n(for example, a company owned by\none individual) into publicly owned\ncompanies (companies owned by\ntheir shareholders). Shares in private companies cannot be obtained\nwithout the consent of the owners,\nwhereas shares in public companies can be bought by any member\nof the public and are traded openly\non a stock exchange.\nThere are several different ways\nin which an IPO may be carried\nout. In a placing, the most common\nmethod of flotation, the bank advising the company, will contact institutional investors (for example, the\nmanagers of pension funds who\nhave a significant amount of cash\nthey wish to invest for the good of\ntheir clients). The bank will offer\nto sell a portion of the company\u2019s\nshares to such an investor for a\nprice determined by the bank.\nAn offer for sale is a more expensive method, due to the publicity\nrequired, and is generally used for\nvery large companies. However,\nunder recent rules, this method\nmay be combined with a flotation\nby placing. Firstly, a company sets\nout its operations, including an offer price per share, in a detailed\nprospectus. In a conventional offer,\ninvestors wishing to buy shares at\nthe offer price then apply to do so\nbefore the deadline. After the dead-line, the shares are allocated and\nthe company receives its cash. If\nthe offer is oversubscribed, each\ninvestor may be given fewer shares\nthan applied for or shares may be\nallocated by ballot. In a tender offer,\nno price is given; rather, the investors will give a price themselves.\nAfter the deadline, the investor\nwith the highest price will be given\nshares first, and so on until all the\nshares have been allocated.\nThe price offered per share in a\nplacing or conventional offer for\nsale is set by the advising bank.\nUsually, this is marginally lower\nthan the price it believes it can ob-tain. This causes a rise in the price\nof the shares when they begin trad-ing, reflecting well upon the com-pany. If every penny were squeezed\nfrom the shares in the IPO, the\nshare price may fall when trading\nbegins, making the company look\nbad and possibly being worse in the\nlong run.\nThe amount of capital raised by a\ncompany depends on two factors:\nthe prospects of the company and\nthe state of the market. The latter\nis difficult to control; for example,\nthe Bank of England may increase\ninterest rates, making the market\nnervous and less willing to buy\nshares in the company, harming\nits flotation. To protect against this\nuncertainty, companies will have\ntheir shares underwritten. Underwriting is the process by which\nan investment bank (acting as the\nunderwriter) will, for a fee, agree\nto carry the risk of any shares that\nare not sold (i.e. if the offer is un-dersubscribed). In the event of this,\nthe bank will buy back any unsold\nshares so that the company can\nbe sure that all their shares are\nsold and the floatation is a success.\nWhen issues are successful and\nthere are sufficient investors to buy\nthe stock, the underwriters stand\nto make a substantial fee; however,\na poorly received offer can cost underwriters millions of pounds.\nClever tactics may also be used\nto help flotations. Greenshoes help\nkeep share prices up after trading\nbegins. Known as an over-allotment\n4 felix Friday 10 November 2006\nBUSINESS business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe trading floor, where billions of pounds switch hands instantly\noption, this is best described with\nan example.\nThe underwriters for company\nA sell 1 million shares in an IPO,\nplus an additional amount, say\n100,000, that the underwriter short\nsells (selling shares that you don\u2019t\nown). When shares begin trading, if\nthe price falls, the underwriter will\nbuy 100,000 shares from the market\nto cover the short selling. The act\nof buying shares pushes the price\nback up, and leaves the underwriter with a profit (as they bought back\nfrom the market at less than the\nprice they sold at). If however the\nprice rises, the underwriter is left\nwith 100,000 short sold shares that\nthey must cover. Instead of making a loss by buying these from the\nmarket, the underwriter exercises\nthe greenshoe, which allows them\nto buy 100,000 shares from company A at issue price (the price they\nwere shorted for). Greenshoes are\nso named because such an option\nwas first granted to underwriters\nby the Green Shoe Company.\nSome of the most publicised\nIPOs include Google, who floated\nin August 2004, with an offering of\n$1.7 billion, ICBC (Industrial and\nCommercial Bank of China), who\nsuccessfully completed the world\u2019s\nlargest ever float of $21.8 billion in\nOctober this year, and the 1987 issue of British Petroleum, that was\nso poorly received by the market\nit cost its underwriters millions of\npounds to buy back its undersub-scribed shares.\nLast Thursday Imperial Entrepreneurs (IE) followed their hugely\nsuccessful launch event with an\neven hotter one to mark the start\nof their Spark A Company (SAC)\nprogram.\nJames Murray Wells, founder and\nmanaging director of Glassesdirect.\nco.uk, was the featured speaker, an\noutstanding choice to launch SAC\nas this program hopes to inspire\nstudents to do exactly what he did \u2013\ngetting his venture going and making a success of it. At 23, James has\ngrown Glassesdirect from starting\nwith \u00a31000 to a business expected\nto turnover over \u00a33m this year in\njust two years. Undercutting his\nhigh street rivals by up to ten times,\nGlassesdirect has sent shockwaves\nthrough the optical industry, a market worth over \u00a32.4 billion a year in\nthe UK. In 2005 he won the UK Shell\nLiveWIRE Young Entrepreneur of\nthe Year award, Credit Suisse Entrepreneur of the Year award, and\nEnterprising Young Brit 2005 and\nattracted press coverage in publications including the FT, The Sunday\nTimes, and The Daily Telegraph.\nIn addition, of the top 50 entrepreneurs of 2005 as rated by startups.\nco.uk, he beat Sir Richard Branson,\nSir Alan Sugar, and Stelios Haji-Ioannou, to come 1st place.\nJames told students how he remembers having had a few brilliant\nbusiness ideas before, which he let\npass him by. However when he had\nhis latest eureka moment he decided to finally do something about it\nand take that idea all the way to create a concrete business. He started\nresearching the glasses sales mod-el, questioning it, wondering why a\npair of glasses should cost around\n\u00a3150 when they contain \u201cless metal\nthan a spoon\u201d. Soon he realized that\nthe high cost did not come from the\nraw materials or suppliers but from\nthe high street shops who inflated\ndistributor prices to make big prof-its. After researching the feasibility of his idea he recruited 8 other\nuniversity students and turned his\nparent\u2019s home into his office during the early stages of the start up.\nHe nostalgically remembers cables\nrunning from bedroom to bedroom,\nup and down the stairs, and his\nmum making \u201cbacon sandwiches in\nthe kitchen\u201d for his new employees.\nSales began to come in almost im-mediately, and the business began\nto grow. He is now planning an international expansion to take place\nsometime next year. He also told of\nhow in addition to all the well known\nobstacles of setting up your own\nbusiness straight out of university,\nhe has been experiencing mounting pressure from big high street\nretailers who try to push him out\nof business. His exhibits included\nlegal notices from lawyers, letters\nand faxes from suppliers unwilling\nto deal with him, and even disturbing (yet quite funny) recorded telephone conversations with insider\n\u2018double agents\u2019.\nThe event was followed by a\nsumptuous reception at the trendy\nMed Kitchen on Gloucester Road.\nIt provided a fun and flamboyant\nnetworking opportunity where ideas and business cards were fiercely\nexchanged. Members from all main\nentrepreneurship societies were\nthere: Cambridge Entrepreneurs,\nOxford entrepreneurs, LSE entre-preneurs, and Imperial Entrepreneurs came together and discussed\nentrepreneurial interests while\nenjoying chilled white wine and\nMediterranean-food starters. John\nWilson from Folio Partners said, \u201cIt\nwas great to see so many students\nbursting with ideas and enthusiasm\nto run businesses.\u201d\nSpark A Company lights up\nJames Wells (glassesdirect) and Alex Backshall, IE creative officer\nCraig Lukins & Emily Tam\nBusiness Correspondents\nIt\u2019s unlikely that in your entrepreneurial lectures at Tanaka you\u2019ve\never heard starting a company likened to firing a Bazooka, but Charlie\nOsmond\u2019s opening salvo of \u201cReady,\nFire, Aim?\u201d will long go down in\nthe memories of those that were\npresent at the spectacular launch\nof the Imperial Entrepreneurs society on the 19th of October.\nTogether with Alex Tew, founder\nof Milliondollarhomepage.com, and\nMichael Smith of Firebox.com, the\ntrio set the scene for an engaging\nnight of anecdotes and fly-on-the-wall accounts of starting up. Smith\nentertained the audience with how\na drunken night of chess inspired\nFirebox\u2019s first ever product, the\nshot-glass chess set, and how the\nsite embarrassingly almost went\nout of business when their original name, Hotbox, was found to be\nthe domain of a popular adult site!\nAlex Tew, creator of milliondol-larhomepage, surprised many of\nthe audience by playing down he\nwas a one-hit wonder and explaining that before setting up the mil-liondollarhomepage, his entrepreneurial drive started at the age of\n12 selling comics and at 17 setting\nup the largest community of beat-boxers in the world on humanbeat-box.com. Alex also dropped hints of\nhis next venture, which plays on his\noriginal theme of the pixelated phenomenon but enables the user to\nshare money generated by the site.\nAll three speakers were keen to\nstress that while luck had played a\npart, had they not taken the plunge\nwhile still being a student they\nwould have undoubtedly ended up\nbeing stuck on the career hamster-wheel and many times worse off\nfinancially.\nThe buzz and energy of the\nevening spilled over into the lavish afterparty in the Tanaka bar,\nallowing many Imperial Entrepreneurs members to network and\nbounce ideas with invited entrepreneurs and investors over copious\namounts of Cobra beer and snacks.\nThe guestlist spanned many well\nknown companies, including the\nBBC, MTV networks, Vodafone,\nand the Sunday Times. The night\nprovided a genuine opportunity for\nImperial students to look beyond\nthe gloss and hype that surrounds\nhow entrepreneurship is presented\nand get inside the personalities\nof the entrepreneurs at the event.\nThe event was described by Simon\nStockley, head of the MBA programme at the Tanaka Business\nSchool, as \u201cthe best student event\nI\u2019ve ever been to\u201d, and by IE member Frank Mayne as \u201cthe epitome\nof cool!\u201d\nEntrepreneurs\u2019 launch party\nMichael Smith from firebox.com\nSumon Sadhu\nBusiness Correspondent\n\n"

    "content": "This week sees the release of Creative Assembly\u2019s latest swords-and-sieges-and-squalor opus, Medieval\n2: Total War. For someone like me,\nwho has lost entire weekends to its\npredecessors (and I still think of the\nPope as someone to assassinate\nrather than the leader of one of the\nworld\u2019s most influential religions),\nthis is one of the events of the year,\nand I\u2019ll probably spend half of the\ncoming month believing fervently\nthat I am the King of England. Despite being Scottish. Part of this is\ndown to the fact that the Total War\ngames have the immersive qualities of an Olympic swimming pool,\nsurrounding you with period detail\nthat nonetheless retains a humorous touch. The rest is down to the\nTotal War games being so much fun\nto play, and unique at that.\nCreative Assembly\u2019s mastery of\nthe empire-building-and-battling\ngenre is so complete that it could\nbe called a monopoly. For many\ncompanies, this would be an invitation for them to rest on their Rome:\nTotal War branded laurels, but CA\nsoldier on with improvements and\nperfections to their existing formu-la. Granted, Medieval 2 will not be\nthe quantum leap that Rome was,\nbut even at the shallowest level,\nM2:TW is a different beast. Graphically stunning, you could almost\nbelieve that you were actually witnessing medieval battles if it wasn\u2019t\nfor the whole \u2018floating in the sky\nChivalry, shanks and shoulder pads\nThere never was a good war. Unless you use elephants, explains Andrew Dunn\nWar has never been so much fun!\nTasteless or intelligent design? Tony Plana loves the smell of satire in the morning\nOut now\n\u201cKupo? Kupopo!\u201d\nfor good measure \u2013 and to me, this\njust isn\u2019t good enough. It has both\ntank rushes and shoulder pads!\nCould it be any less appealing?\nSimilarly, other strategy games\nare failing to push the envelope in\nmany ways. Some developers try\nto nose ahead of the pack with cinematic spectacle, tanks and people\nswearing, some just slap together\nyet another sub-Tolkien fantasy\nsetting and hope like mad that the\npunters will buy it. Others genuinely try to innovate, whether it be\nSupreme Commander\u2019s modelling\nof war on an unprecedented, epic\nscale (albeit with a disappointingly\ngeneric sci-fi coating) or the Total\nWar games\u2019 marriage of real-time\nin-depth tactics and ruling the minutiae of a country.\nWhether the strategy genre can\nevolve and keep us interested remains to be seen. All I know is that\nfor the coming month, you can steer\nclear unless you\u2019re willing to call\nme \u2018sire\u2019 and send me emissaries\ndetailing the level of public order\nin Rouen. The rest of you peasants\ncan go hang.\nwith a mouse cursor\u2019 thing; leaving\neye candy aside, the game is implementing such things as religion and\ntrade in a more complex (yet acces-sible) way than ever before. But\neven the most ardent fanboy would\nbe hard pressed to claim that these\nare monumental advances. No-one\nis going to wax lyrical about being\nable to rig Papal elections in the\nsame way that they did when Shogun: Total War first introduced us\nto the wonders of tactical battling\non a grand scale, or when Command & Conquer let us loose on\nthe tank rush (which was actually\nfashionable once upon a time, a bit\nlike shoulder pads and the British\nEmpire). Is the strategy genre as a\nwhole losing its progressive edge?\nCommand & Conquer is a good\nexample. Back in \u201997, when men\nwere men and I was still in primary school, I loved the C&C games.\nDearly. Whether detailing strange\ncartoony sci-fi terrorism or strange\ncartoony sci-fi Soviets, I couldn\u2019t get\nenough of them. But with the announcement of the so-called \u2018third\u2019\nin the series, I find that my anticipation has upped sticks and moved to\nthe Cotswolds for its retirement. No\nmatter what I read of C&C 3, I can\u2019t\nget excited about it. Mention this to\npeople and they treat me like I\u2019m\nsome mad heretic. It\u2019s a game that\nseems to be riding entirely on the\nsuccess of its predecessors with a\nbit more bump-mapping thrown in\nTotal War, yesterday. Not pictured - our intrepid writer, cackling\nArt imitates life, as they say. A century ago, the idea of rushing two\nlarge bodies of men towards each\nother was still thought of as a pretty neat idea, and easily the most\nintelligent way to fight a war. Now,\nthe missiles we\u2019re firing at enemy\nnations are only marginally less\nintelligent than the ones pressing\nthe big red button to launch it. And\nfor gaming, too, the war genre has\nevolved a lot in its short life.\nIf you\u2019re reading this, chances are\nthe only wars you\u2019ve lived through\nwere either cold, or at best luke-warm. War isn\u2019t something we\ninstinctively relate with the real\nworld very much. But it\u2019s also likely \u2013 if you\u2019ve been gaming for any\nlength of time \u2013 that you\u2019ll have\nplayed Command And Conquer :\nRed Alert. Of course, humourously\nleather-bound Soviets and\nslightly over-enthusiastic\nfemale commandos are\na slightly skewed\nportrayal of war-fare. But Red\nAlert wasn\u2019t exactly alone in\npainting a surreal\nview of fictional\n\u2013 and non-fictional\n\u2013 warfare.\nCannon Fodder\n\u2013 War Has Never Been So Much\nFun! \u2013 in terms of setting the stylistic tone for a game, you can\u2019t get\nmuch better than that. Cannon Fodder is generally recognised as being\nahead of its time in that regard, as\nwell as few other fields, such as its\nrelationship with the press. \u201cMake\nsure you do not buy this shameful\ngame\u201d was the Daily Star\u2019s reaction to the game, after the British\nLegion complained it had used the\nCorn Poppy on the game box. Maybe this wouldn\u2019t have been so contentious a move if the game itself\nhadn\u2019t largely based itself around\nmaking a joke of war and modern\nwarfare in general. Between that\nand Wolfenstein 3D\u2019s historically-ambiguous Robo-Hitler (I\u2019m told\nthat the jury is still out as to whether or not Adolf was in possession of\na mecha-suit), it\u2019s a wonder anyone took anything seriously\nin the early nineties.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all gram-matically-incorrect\nGerman and cute\nsoldiers bleeding to\ndeath. When Platoon\nwas released in the\nlate eighties, only a\ndecade after the Vietnam War had come to\na close, the game that\nfollowed shortly after attempted to\nbring some of the feel of the film\nto gaming too. Hard though it was\nto convey political opinion with a\npalette of 16 colours and just about\nenough memory to remember what\nlevel the player was on, Platoon was\none of a number of war games that\ndidn\u2019t suffer from the caricature\nage of videogaming. There was no\nneed to dumb down the message,\nor dilute the experience any further\nthan the technology already had.\nAnd though we highlighted Cannon Fodder earlier as being an example of light-hearted war gaming,\nthat\u2019s a highly unfair view of the\ngame. Cannon Fodder, despite being demonised for \u2018glorifying\u2019 war,\nactually aimed to satirise the view\nof war perpetrated by Vietnam and\nthe Gulf. Tiny pixellated recruits\nqueued up to be enlisted next to\na hill where hundreds of graves\nmarked the fates of the last crop. It\nwas unnervingly violent, certainly,\nbut never intended to mock.\nIt\u2019s possible \u2013 if cynical \u2013 to say\nthat war gaming got stale as its\npopularity grew. But whatever the\ncause for change, the past is rich\nwith counterexamples. There was\nthe cartoon-like side of the death\nand destruction, but there was also\na lot of seriousness, and plenty of\ndesigners who had something to\ncommunicate to gamers. What is it\ngood for? If what war games have\nbecomeisanythingtogoby,perhaps\nvery little. But both Cannon Fodder\nand Wolfenstein represent a kind of\nplayful enthusiasm for the genre\nthat may have been lost in the endless drive for realism and grittiness.\nMaybe the lesson to learn from the\npast of gaming, much like the past\nof war itself, is that a load of explosions doesn\u2019t get you anywhere\nuseful at all. Nowadays, bombarded\nwith a numbing stream of cod-Pri-vate-Ryan sanitised \u2018war horror\u2019,\nwe can\u2019t help but be numbed by it.\nIn an age of blood and gore, maybe\nwe need a few robo-suits.\nWar - your results may vary\nEither by complete coincidence,\nor shrewd marketing, Call of\nDuty 3 (below) is released on the\nXbox 360 just a day before Remembrance Day. As our feature\non the opposite page suggests, it\u2019s\nstill the same old explosions and\ngunfire \u2013 but by the same token,\nit\u2019s still a visceral, exciting experience that\u2019s not to be missed. Releases on other platforms follow in\nthe coming weeks.\nIf you\u2019re finding that a little bit\ntoo frantic, however, you may wish\nto distance yourself from the action a little with Medieval 2: Total\nWar, a triumphant \u2013 graphically,\nif nothing else \u2013 return to familiar\nterritory for developers Creative\nAssembly.

The figures\nappear to have leaked to numerous non-sabbaticals. Mr Matthews,\nwhen asked if the figures had been\nmade available in the past, stated\nthat he believed so, but did not\nknow in what committee or what\npaper they had been made avail-able. Ashley Brown, Live! editor,\nattempted to locate these figures in\nUnion minutes and papers, which\nare available online, but was unable\nto do so.\nThe figures are divided into two\nparts. The first set of figures concerns the affiliation fee the Union\nwill have to pay if the student body\nvotes to join the NUS in the upcoming referendum. This number is\nbased on the money the Union receives from the College to provide\nits services (called the subvention)\nand the number of students who\nare members of the Union, and is\ncapped at \u00a352,000.\nThe second part of the figures\nconcerns the fee the Union must\npay ULU as part of the withdrawl\nagreement. Although the College\nis to be awarded its own degree-awarding powers separate from the\nUniversity of London (UL), it will\nstill have students on degrees affiliated with UL, and therefore must\ncontinue to pay a fee to ULU to use\nthe services they provide.\nThe figures reveal that the first\nyear cost of the NUS affiliation fee\nis predicted to be \u00a335,000, and that\nthe fee paid to ULU will be \u00a378,000.\nAs College pays this fee directly to\nULU, that will leave the Union needing to find \u00a335,000 to cover the NUS\nfee. Whether or not the College will\nstep in to help carry this financial\nburden is not clear yet, and John\nCollins, the Union President, has\nbeen meeting with College officials,\nincluding the Rector, Sir Richard\nSykes, and the Deputy Rector, Sir\nLeszek Borysiewicz to discuss this\npossibility.\nThe second year\u2019s figures show\nthe ULU fee dropping to \u00a345,000\nfrom \u00a378,000, while the NUS figure\nincreases to around \u00a342,000 from\n\u00a335,000. These figures do not include additional costs, such as the\nreplacement of services that were\nonce provided by ULU, predicted\nby Mr Collins on questioning by Felix to be \u201caround \u00a310-15k\u201d. It also\ndoes not include the likely income\nfrom sales of the NUS Extra card.\n\u00a34 of every \u00a310 card sold is return\nto the participating Union. To cover\nthe above cost, the NUS Extra card\nwould have to be bought by more\nthan a quarter of the student body,\nsomething that seems unlikely given IC student apathy and the negative feeling that the Extra card has\ngenerated among many students\u2019\nunions, with the NUS actively attempting to block students without\nthe Extra card from receiving the\nExtra discount.\nMr Collins stressed that the eventual departure from ULU would\npay for the NUS affiliation fee, and\ncover the loss made in the hypothetical first two years of NUS af-filiation. As the ULU affiliation fee\ndecreases over time, the NUS affiliation will increase to the cap of\n\u00a352,000, likely to be reached within\nthree years. Assuming all students\nat the College currently on UL degrees will have completed these\nwithin five years, Felix\u2019s back-of-an-envelope calculations suggest that\nafter three years, the Union begins\nto break even, compared to simply\npaying for the ULU affiliation fee.\nMr Collins also promised that\nNUS affiliation would bring savings\nin the training of Union officers of\n\u201ca few thousand pounds,\u201d further\noff-setting the initial expense.\nMr Collins did point out that the\nUnion has a sizeable cash reserve\n(estimated at around \u00a31m), as well\nas numerous other contigency\nfunds it can draw upon to pay the\nfee. However, this cash reserve is\ncurrently set aside to cover the cost\nof the Union redevelopment, which\nis estimated to have cost \u00a31.25m so\nfar. Mr Collins said that the College\nshould be footing the bill when it ar-rives, but the money has not been\nprovided yet.\nThis reporter would like to remind its readers that Felix is bound\nby the Union constitution\u2019s regulations on referenda, and therefore\nis not permitted to hold an official\nopinion on the NUS referendum.\nThis reporter would also like to\nremind readers that the Union\u2019s\nconstitution requires that you think\nbefore you vote.\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\nEx-editor wins\nGuardian award\nRupert Neate (pictured), last year\u2019s Felix editor, walked away\nwith the top prize at the Guardian Student Media Awards 2006,\nbeing named Journalist of the Year.

    "content": "In pursuit of the perfect boiled egg\nCooking + science + bald, domed foreheaded, self-confessed culinary alchemist = molecular gastronomy\nI have to begin this review with a\nwarning \u2013 watching In Pursuit Of\nPerfection could seriously titillate\nyour taste buds. This new eight-part cookery series features the\n\u2018flavour-of-the-month\u2019 chef Heston\nBlumenthal demonstrating how to\n\u2018perfect\u2019 everyday dishes, such as\npizza, spag bol, and fish and chips.\nThe secret \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 is\nscience. Blumenthal is a self-styled\n\u2018culinary alchemist\u2019 who practises\nthe art of \u2018molecular gastronomy\u2019.\nThis hi-tech approach to cooking is\nall about understanding how to pre-Edward Wawrzynczak pare and combine ingredients to\noptimise the way food looks, smells\nand tastes. Hold on, I can hear you\nask, isn\u2019t this what cooking has always been about? Well, yes \u2013 even\nBlumenthal admits that what he\ndoes is old-fashioned cooking with\na bit of science thrown in.\nAs the proprietor of The Fat\nDuck, which has been awarded\nthree Michelin stars and was voted\n\u2018best restaurant in the world\u2019 in\n2005, Blumenthal is famous for innovative dishes that bring together\nunexpected combinations such as\nsnail porridge and bacon-and-egg\nice cream. So you can figure out\nthat he is a seriously smart cook\nand not a man to trifle with.\nAnd, as you might expect, this\nprofessor of kitchen science has\nhis own laboratory with all kinds\nof experimental apparatus that\nwould not be amiss in the typical\nuniversity chemistry department.\nIndeed, he looks comfortingly bof-fin-like with his domed forehead,\nsafety goggles and thermal gloves.\nThe white uniform he wears is, of\ncourse, common to both kitchen\nand lab.\nIn pursuit of the perfect banger,\nBlumenthal and his team experimented to find the right combination of meat, casings, filler, spices,\nseasonings, flavourings, and preparation conditions. If I simply mention that you need to use pork thigh\nto retain moisture, oak-smoked\nback fat for the authentic barbecued taste, and water flavoured\nwith oven-toasted bread, you will\ngather that this is no ordinary cookery programme.\nIn fact, this programme is so extraordinary that it is difficult to\nfigure out who it is aimed at. The\nlab-concocted recipes are quite\nimpractical \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 for\nthe average cook. And the details\ndo not appear on the BBC website\nso that you will fail to reach sausage\nheaven, even if you are a dedicated\nchef, unless you buy the inevitable\nrecipe book.\nSeeing Blumenthal standing by\na gas chromatograph and sniffing\naromas \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m getting candyfloss,\nmolasses, even a slight \u2018figgy\u2019 note,\nalso a note of overripe banana\u201d\n\u2013 reminded me of those pompous,\nso-called expert pundits of the wine\nworld. The posturing was made\neven more amusing by the fact that\nmuch earnest investigation failed\nto displace Golden Syrup as the essential ingredient of treacle tart.\nOn balance, the first programme\nof the series was well made and\nwas suitably light and entertaining fare. But, despite the novelty of\nthe science angle, it failed to avoid\nthe clich\u00e9d and outworn format of\nthe genre. So if the cooking is a little tedious to watch, the recipes a\nstretch to execute, and the science\na bit of a gimmick, why should you\nwatch the series?\nThe answer is straightforward.\nAnything that takes the trial-and-error out of cooking, and makes you\nbetter at it, is worth knowing about.\nAnd Blumenthal knows his stuff.\nIn Pursuit Of Perfection offers up\nenough useful tips to make it worth\nfollowing. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried\nsome of the recipes in my laboratory \u2013 er, kitchen \u2013 and the results\nwere excellent.\nEddie Wawrzynczak as Blumenthal\u2019s sous-chef back in the day when\nthey worked together in London\u2019s The Whopping Sausage\nA Michelin star cross\u2019d food lover.

I can\nassure you that in reality I am hunky, 7\u20196\u201d\nPortuguese body-boarder. But this is ir-relevant. I also said in Felix last week that\nI was going to put in a feature of the independent music media in this issue of Femm.\nI\u2019m sorry to inform you that said article will\nnot feature until December since I ran out\nof space in this issue. I hope you can wait\nuntil then.\nI have noticed lately that this new genre\ncalled \u2018New-Rave\u2019 seems to be on everybody\u2019s lips (or just NME\u2019s). It does make\nme guffaw that having a guitar band use\nacid house sirens (The Klaxons) is the basis for an amalgamation of shit indie and\neven shitter rave. Hard electro is the only\nway to go, and that rhymes so it must be\ntrue. But in fitting with the mention of this\nnew genre I decided to unearth the part of\nLondon where a lot of this hyperbole came\nfrom ie, Shoreditch and Hoxton. Sure\nenough, Trash is on New Oxford St but a\nlot of the scenesters have emerged from\nthe east. I actually like a lot of what is happening in East London at the minute with\nvarious alternative and avant garde shows\nhappening. I know the idea of Imperial scientists embracing those good-for-nothing\narty types is repugnant, and truth be told\na lot of those artists are tedius (just watch\nNathan Barley), but only good can come\nout of it. Otherwise they\u2019ll keep inventing\ngenres and drive us all insane.\nThere is another Kids Will Be Skeletons\ngig night on Thursday 16th November\nwith Yuchi from Brighton headlining and\ntwo brilliant London bands (Silent Front\nand The Sailplanes) supporting. \u00a32 to get\nin and a lot of fun and giggles to be had.\nCome on down and pester me, or hug me,\nI like hugs. Have a good read.\nbitrate\nS\no, you\u2019re hoping to get that shiny\nnew 15,000 GB mp3 player that fits\ninto your wallet for Christmas, but\nalas, all your music is still stuck on\nthe archaic format of a CD, or even\nworse the prehistoric vinyl record. What\u2019s\nmore you don\u2019t want to use the crappy ripping software that comes with either itunes\nor God forbid, Windows Media Player to\nconvert your favourite tunes to computer\nformat.\nFirst things first, this beautiful article will\nnot only teach all you crazy kids how to rip\na nice mp3 and what all those weird options\nmean (using some decent free encoders) but\nwe\u2019ll also show a few clever ways of getting\nrid of that pesky DRM protection you get on\niTunes mp3s that you\u2019ve bought from their\nonline store so you don\u2019t have to use one of\nthose stinking iPods to listen to it, and you\ncan even send them to your mates if you feel\nlike running some sort of charity.\nHooray, let\u2019s start with the illegalness. Remember kids, downloading music is illegal\nand it destroys everyone involved in the music industry especially the directors of the\nbig record companies who might only earn a\n\u00a334m salary this year because of it, so if you\ntry any of this, you are going straight to hell\nfor eternity. Sweet.\nMP3 encoding can be confusing for the\nnewcomer, although since we\u2019re at Imperial\nCollege, I\u2019m sure most of you know everything there is to know and could probably\nprogram your own encoder with your eyes\nshut, but I\u2019m writing this article for the\nbenefit of those who can\u2019t do that (yep, geologists and the dudes at Wye). Who would\nlike to be a bit more adventurous than use\nthe built in ripping software in their media\nplayer, and enjoy the host of new options\navailable to you when using a good compression software. So before you start, go download EAC (Exact Audio Copier) and LAME\nencoder (all links at the end of the article),\nI assume you all know how to install some\nsoftware so we won\u2019t go through that part,\njust install EAC and unzip the LAME encoder into its directory (or anywhere else you\nwon\u2019t delete it). Now open up EAC and go to\nEAC then Compression Options and select\nthe External Compression tab. Now select\n\u2018use external program for compression\u2019 box,\nselect LAME from the dropdown menu then\nbelow that, find where you\u2019ve unzipped the\nLAME encoder .exe file to. For the bitrate\nselect 192 or above (unless you want horrendous quality tracks), you can also select variable bit rate which basically increases the\nbit rate in certain, more complex parts of a\nsong, and reduces it in simpler parts making\nfor a smaller file size.\nIf the instructions for installation were too\nbrief I apologise, but there is a configuration\nwizard and help files you can use if you need\nmore info, so onto the actual stuff in the pro-gram. If you look in the compression options\nthere\u2019s a host of useful things, most of them\npretty self-explanatory so just check them\nout, one nice option is you can select your\nown format for file naming of the mp3\u2019s and\nyou can even save the uncompressed .wav\nfiles if you want to fill your hardrive up with\nmaximum quality music. Once you\u2019ve decided all your options, just put your CD in\nthe drive and rip away. You can even use the\nFreeDB option to automatically detect your\nalbum and name all the songs correctly.\nAnother handy function of the program is\nbeing able to compress stored .wav files into\nmp3 so if you\u2019ve decided to record some vinyl onto your pc using an audio cable or are\nstealing music from MySpace by recording\nit, you can make it into a nice, small mp3 and\nnot some hideous 60Mb .wav file. Once it\u2019s\nripped and compressed, bask in the sound of\nsuperior, un-Apple/Microsoft tainted mp3s.\nFor those of you who prefer to buy your\nmp3s directly from iTunes Music Store and\nbypass those stupid CDs, you may have noticed that some of their files have that annoying Digital Rights Management protection on them, meaning you can\u2019t play your\nmp3s on anything other than an iPod, or a\ncouple of computers with iTunes installed.\nThat\u2019s a bit annoying so our next section is\nhow to remove it, resulting in lovely playable\nmp3s (although instead of doing this I\u2019d suggest you just buy your mp3s from e-Music or\nsome other store that does not claim ownership of the items you\u2019ve paid for). We\u2019re\ngoing to ignore the ultra-time-consuming\nmethod of real-time recording of the mp3\nas a .wav then re-encoding it, that\u2019s just silly\nunless you only want to do a single song.\nThe first method is the simplest, but also\nresults in a small (although sometimes in-audible) loss in sound quality. Just burn your\nalbum of mp3s as an Audio CD then simply\nrip it back to mp3. This will remove any DRM\nfrom the files leaving you with proper mp3s,\nbut is unfortunately somewhat wasteful of\nCDs (unless you use a re-writable CD), time\nconsuming, and as mentioned, re-encoding\nan mp3 results in a loss of quality (imagine\nmaking a photocopy of a photocopy and re-Gregory Mead\nfemm 2\nFriday 10th November 2006\nMatty Hoban\npeating that thousands of times, the final\nimage would be totally horrendous).\nOf course, if you want to go all out and\nunlock your mp3s completely without any\nloss in sound quality then you can, by using\nsome clever script that does it all automatically for you! There are two lossless DRM\nremoval programs available, the first (and\nbest) is JHymn which is a free protection\nremoval program, that even keeps the\nmetadata of the tracks (song name, track\nnumber, album etc.) in the resulting mp3.\nUnfortunately this only works with iTunes\n3, 4 and 5 so if you\u2019re using iTunes 6 you\nneed to use the second removal tool avail-able, QTFairUse 6. The only drawback\nwith this one is that it\u2019s a Python script,\nso you need to know some stuff about that\nto actually use it, also it doesn\u2019t keep the\nmetadata from the tracks, so you\u2019d need to\ngo through all the mp3\u2019s re-naming them,\nbut then, who cares?

    "content": "feature\nfemm\n7 Friday 10th November 2006\nartists\nin\nfocus\nB\nattle, KOKO, and an all access pass - a good setup,\nfor a very good night. For\nthose of you who aren\u2019t in\nthe know, Battle are a four-piece band from London,\nand KOKO is a reasonably\nsized venue in Camden.\nBattle opened with Beautiful Dynasty, a\nb-side from one of their four single releas-es. They appeared onstage in a lazy manner and gradually added their input to the\ndrummer\u2019s (Oliver Davies) enthusiastic\nbeat. Looking around, only half of the crowd\nlooked as if they had heard anything of Battle before. Not that it mattered; since by\nthe second song I was fairly convinced that\nevery single person in the venue was almost\naddicted to the sound.\nAlthough the vocals could have been more\naudible they sounded sharp, and the band\nlooked as if they were enjoying the set just\nas much as everyone else. After the set we\nwandered backstage to find the band.\nSitting in the green room casually talking\nto the Cooper Temple Clause (the next performers and, indeed, the headlining act), and\nthe lead singer from Bloc Party (just there\nto see the gig), was nowhere near as surreal\nas I felt it should have been. Half of Battle\nwander in and collapse on the couch. Having had to cancel the previous night\u2019s gig in\nNottingham due to illness, they stay only for\na brief chat then head off to get some rest,\nleaving us with guarantees that the band\u2019s\nother half will reappear at some point.\nAfter drinking a fairly substantial amount\nof Cooper Temple Clause\u2019s vodka, we find\nJames and Tim (lead guitar and bass gui-tar). After congratulating them on a fantastic set we got down to an interview.\nSo about 8 months ago now I picked up\nyour single Tendency out of our papers\u2019 review box and thought it was pretty damn\ngood. But I haven\u2019t been able to find much\nmore of your stuff. What\u2019s out there? Is\nthere anything on the way we can look\nforward to?\nReally? That\u2019ll be \u2018cause most of them are\nlimited releases, but there\u2019s a mini album\ncoming out on Monday (23rd) - 7 tracks for\nyou.\nWhat about a full album?\nIt\u2019ll be out next year, were not quite sure\nwhen yet. Basically what happened was we\nhad an album all ready to go but we\u2019ve been\nwriting quite a lot of new songs and some of\nthe songs we\u2019d recorded were getting quite\nold.\nI mean you\u2019ve got your whole life to make\nyour first album, that\u2019s what they say. It\u2019s a\nbit scary so we said we\u2019d build up a fan base\nand write some wicked songs. So we took\nsome of the tracks off the album to make\nthis mini album and we\u2019ve got some new\nsongs on there as well.\nThe actual LP is now down and ready\nfor finishing touches to about 7 tracks, but\nwe\u2019ve been writing a load of new stuff that\nwe're really happy with.\nYeah, that new track you played tonight\nwas immense; I think I was the third one?\nWe were a bit nervous about that one \u2018cause\nwe\u2019d literally just finished it.\nWell if it helps we thought it was up there\nwith Tendency (second released single).\nYou\u2019ve done a fair bit of touring over the\nlast few months, best gig of the summer?\nErm\u2026 It was the little shows, the funny little ones. We did one in Aberdeen in a trendy\npub it was really small and there were a load\nof sofas at the back with people just drinking wine. But there was just something\nabout the sound and the way we played and\nconnected.\nI mean tonight\u2019s gig was good but, well I\nonly get nervous now when we play London\ncause all your friends and family are there\nand everyone\u2019s expecting so much of you.\nI count about 9/10 months now you\u2019ve\nbeen Battle, is that right?\nNah, I think it\u2019s been longer than that. I\nmean we released our 1st single in September last year (Demons). I guess we changed\nour name just before we were signed.\nWhat were you called to begin with?\nWell we were called Killing Moon, but basically it was a shit name so we were like,\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change it!\u201d So we did and I\u2019m\nglad we did. We moved forward away from\nthat one.\nSo does the name Battle mean anything in\nparticular for the four of you?\nYeah it does actually, it does. Its sort of the\nidea of struggling against the odds, I don\u2019t\njust mean in terms of your career as the\nband, that'd be self indulgent. But you know\nall good art is born out of some sense of\ndissatisfaction. I mean if you\u2019re happy and\nyou\u2019re sorted and you\u2019re already rich, that\u2019s\nwhen bands get shit and when your art gets\nshit. So it\u2019s sort of the idea of struggling and\nbattling against the odds to achieve your\ndreams. We all think we're in a good band,\nbut we\u2019ll never be the band we want to be.\nSo, a year\u2019s time maybe your own headline tour, what venue in London would you\nlike to be playing at?\nIn a year\u2019s time? That\u2019s a hard question. I\nmean, I don\u2019t want to be one of these bands\nthat shoots to the top, and so far we haven\u2019t,\nit\u2019s been a steady build. All we've got is our\nsongs and in our heads we\u2019ve done so much.\nBut really we only have two singles released,\nI think when we get the album out it\u2019ll put\neverything in context and we\u2019ll build from\nthere. But to answer the question, I\u2019d love to\nplay the Astoria. We don\u2019t want to shoot off\nand do huge venues yet and the Astoria still\nhas that intimacy. We\u2019ve played a few bigger\ngigs and it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nSo the next few months what\u2019s in store for\nbattle?\nWell, we\u2019ve got the rest of this tour which is\nquitelong,thenafewdaysinIrelandandthen\nwe\u2019re doing the Warehouse Project in the old\nBoddington\u2019s Brewery (Manchester)\nTo complete our commentary I thought it\nsuitable to review Battle\u2019s latest release to\nencourage you to go check them out. This\nEP features 7 tracks, their longest release\nto date, the majority of which are taken\nfrom previously released 7-inches and\nsingles. Not that there's anything wrong\nwith that, as the tracks form a great mini\nalbum serving its purpose of introducing\nBattle to the world.\nSpeaking of it's length, NME described\nthe EP like premature ejaculation, over\nfrustratingly quickly. It's hard to disagree\nwith this statement due to the sheer quality of the tracks on the EP - it's clear right\nfrom track one that Battle write great\nsongs.\nHard as it is to choose from the 7 tracks\nmy personal favourite is Tendency.\nThere's something about the way Jason\nBavanandan sings the clearly heartfelt\nlyrics. Something that frequently shines\nthrough on the EP is this raw emotion\nthat inspires Battle's music - a rarity in the\nmodern world of manufactured bands.\nTom Whitson\nDo you have a timescale for getting back\ninto the studio and getting some of the\nnewer songs recorded?\nI think we\u2019re planning to finish the album\nin January, so this month and next month\nwe\u2019re going to do a fair few demos then\ntake a bit of a break over December and\nknock it out fairly fast in January.\nSo how did Battle come about, how did\nyou all meet?\nWell Jamie (guitar) and Jason (vocals)\nwere at school together. We went to uni\ntogether specifically to form a band. It\nsounds very fanciful, and it was very fan-ciful, but after a bit we met Tim (bass) and\nmore recently, about a year and a half ago,\nwe met Oliver (drums). I don\u2019t know why\nbut it\u2019s always the drummer that\u2019s hard to\nfind.\nOne final question and then I\u2019ll let you\nget to the aftershow. What\u2019s your favourite drink?\nFavourite drink? Orange juice! Or water,\nI love water.\nThat\u2019s not particularly rock-\u2019n\u2019-roll, no\nalcohol?\nJason and I are basically tee-total you see.\nGot drunk too much at uni, embarrassed\nmyself one to many times.\nI wish these guys the best of luck, because\nI really would like to see them a year from\nnow with their own headline spot somewhere like the Astoria.\nBattle\nBack to Earth\n(Transgressive)\nHHHHI\nEP review\nALL\nPHOTOS\nTOM\nWHITSON\nThe lead singer from Battle before slamming his guitar into his bits (left) and then screaming from said collision (right)\n\n"

    "content": "live\nThe Raconteurs have done a lot\nto impress the music world in\nthe year they've been together.\nTheir debut album Broken Boy\nSoldiers hit the top ten, reaching\nnumber two in the UK and gathering plenty of critical acclaim\nalong the way. They've played a\nstring of massive gigs and festivals including a mind blowing set\nat The Leeds Festival. Tonight's\nshow was to be no exception,\ncontinuing their fantastic year.\nAfter a great warm up from\nNorwegian folk/retro-rock support act Bigbang, The Raconteurs hit the pitch black stage\nwith their Wild West entrance\nsong. With only one album behind them I wonder how they will\npossibly be able to fill an entire\nhour and a half set, they'd have\nto play Broken Boy Soldiers in its\nentirety - not that that would be a\nbad thing, it's a fantastic album.\nRaconteurs\nThe Brixton Academy\nfemm 4\nFriday 10th November 2006\nAfter their prolonged feedback laden en-trance, they begin with Intimate Secretary\na brilliant song that gets a huge and well deserved response from the sold out Brixton\nAcademy. The show continues in much the\nsame way, with the crowd clearly loving the\nsheer showmanship that the band displays.\nPlaying through the majority of the tracks\non their debut album flawlessly, even the\ncomplex vocal harmonies are perfect, they\nseem to mesmerize the entire crowd for the\nnext hour.\nAs they play it's clear to see that they\nare true musicians toying with their songs\nthroughout the set, deconstructing them\nand adding new depths to the album tracks.\nThey even take on a cover of Sonny Bono's\nBang Bang to great effect. Again they toy\nwith the track breaking it down and adding\nto it, almost doubling its length. For a finale\nBlue Veins was a fantastic choice; it's slow\ntwisting intro builds to a fantastic crescendo\nthat is even more magical live than on CD.\nAs the crowd slowly filed out of the building\nyou could tell they were more than satisfied\nby tonight's performance, and who wouldn't\nbe? A fantastic band of talented musicians\nplaying what can only be described as a\nmagical set.\nThomas Whitson\nThe Raconteurs thrill in Brixton\nFemm enjoys indie super-groups, grating and some disco panicking\nThe Grates\nKing\u2019s College London SU\nThe Grates, a three-piece band\nfrom Brisbane, Australia, are\nknown for their simple, catchy\nand energetic songs. Pop, cer-tainly, but good pop, and positive\ncomparisons have been made to\nboth be your own PET and Yeah\nYeah Yeahs. With that in mind,\nthis gig was no disappointment.\nIt wasn\u2019t sold out, and despite\nbeing at the barrier there was\nplenty of space. Fans (many of\nthem from Australia) were really only to be found in the first\nrow or two of people; this gave\nthe gig a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m so relaxed out\nhere I\u2019m actually meditating\u201d\nPatience, lead singer \u2013 although\nI think it would have been more\nfun had the room been filled with\nfans, which would have had more\nthe atmosphere of a party, that I\nthink would have better suited\nThe Grates.\nThat said, they soon won people over. I felt that their choice\nof first song, Trampoline, was a\ngood one. It set the tone for the\nrest of the set \u2013 Pae, relaxed may-be, but still doing her trademark\ndancing and jumping around\nthe stage (while singing \u2013 with\nbreathlessness thankfully, and\nperhaps surprisingly, absent).\nAlana, the drummer, seemingly\nenjoying every minute of the\nsong\u2019s catchy drumming.\nEven The Grates do have some\nsongs in which dancing as Pae\ndoes would be clearly inappropri-ate. However, she obviously still\nwanted to do something. In the\ncase of Rock Boys, she twirled\nthis baton thing with a ribbon on\nthe end (anyone in Juggling Soc\ncare to tell me what it is?), to good effect, I\nthought. For much of I Am Siam she knelt\ndown at the front of the stage and sang to the\npeople in the first row. For Howl, she passed\nthe mic to the crowd and let them take over\nthe howling at the end. For me, it is this is\nwhat makes The Grates really special live.\nThey have a real connection with the crowd,\neven with one that doesn\u2019t particularly know\nthem, and make people enjoy themselves.\nFinishing on InsideOutside, it was obvious that they weren\u2019t going to leave without\nplaying first and most famous single, 19 20\n20 (although they have been known to skip\nan encore in favour of a drink with fans) \u2013 so\nthe wait for the encore was brief. Playing\nPanic! At The Disco\nThe Brixton Academy\nPanic! At the Disco entered my musical\nworld sometime this summer, and after having listened to their album countless times\nwithout the initial excitement wearing off,\nI was happy to find tickets at a reasonable\nprice on Ebay. The main hall was completely\nfull as soon as we got in, which was surprising as most people generally snob the support band. It turned out that there was a\ngood reason for this not being the case this\ntime, as The Sounds, a female fronted eight-ies-style pop-rock outfit, were definitely worthy of a support slot for Panic! and provided\nentertainment beyond their catchy, dance-oriented brand of rcok. The lead singer, who\nseemed to have had a good few drinks before the show, put in a great deal of energy\ninto the set, which led to her standing on top\nof the drum set licking her hand and hitting\nher arse with it during the last song!\nAfter their 25 minute set, the general excitement grew amongst the groups of 12-15\nyear old girls (which I must admit seemed to\nmake up most of the crowd) resulting in loud\nscreeching throughout the hall. The lights\nwent off before Panic! came on to start the\nset with a double opener consisting of It\u2019s\nTime to Dance and London Beckoned Songs\nAbout Money by Machines. Both tracks\nwere clearly crowd favourites which got everyone jumping about. This was followed by\nThe Only Difference Between Martyrdom\nand Suicide is Press Coverage, another\none of their ridiculously long-titled tracks\nwhich followed the previous two in terms\nof intensity. The effort the band put into\nthe show and the energy they transmitted\nwere fantastic and there is nothing to criticise about in that respect. The burlesque\nset design and dancers they had arranged\nseemed to go down very well with the au-dience, with the highlight being two very\ngood looking dancers coming on stage to\nstart an in-promptu dance routine with\nthe lead singer.\nThe tracks came at a very quick pace,\nwith introductions and spoken moments\nbeing very rare throughout the whole gig.\nHowever Lying is the Most Fun a Girl\nCan Have Without Taking Her Clothes\nOff was described as a song about \u2018angry\nsex\u2019, which got an already excited crowd\ngoing crazy.\nMost of their best tracks seemed to\ncome at the beginning of the show, and I\nwas quite surprised at the lack of greater\nenthusiasm when their no.1 single I Write\nWins Not Tragedies was played. This was\nprobably because of the excessive radio airing that it has received in the last\nmonths. In any case it was played back to\nback with But It\u2019s Better When We Do, due\nto the matching chello intro and outro re-spectively, which worked nicely.\nHaving just released one album so far,\nPanic! quickly started running out of\nsongs, and resorted to playing two covers\nto add length to their set. These were Karma Police (Radiohead) and a Smashing\nPumpkins track. The crowd seemed reasonably pleased with the choice of tracks,\nbut they did not bring out the same reaction in them as panic\u2019s own songs.\nThe set finished with There\u2019s a good reason\u2026 which was not the best of songs to\nend a show with, and it was obvious that\nan encore was to follow. This worked well\ndue to the inclusion of a new track, which\nonly the most hardcore of fans knew but\nwent down well with everyone else too.\nThe final track Thank God for Esteban\nwas another dance song which meant\ntheir one-hour set finished on a high note.\nOverall the evening was fun and the effort and energy the band put into it made\nit worth the money spent on the tickets. I\nwould definitely see them again next time\nround!\nLuca Laraia\njust two songs in the encore (Seems enough\nto me - Ed), the crowd (even the majority\nwho weren\u2019t fans) became excited with it\u2019s\ndistinctive guitar introduction was played,\nalong with Pae\u2019s distinctive 19, \u201320, 20 bunny\nhops.\nNotlongaftertheywentoff-stage,theysoon\nappeared, mingling amongst the remaining\ncrowd. What was great was that it really was\nmingling \u2013 a few autographs and photos, ob-viously, but mostly just chatting with fans.\nThis is something that really couldn\u2019t have\nhappened at, well, most gigs, actually, and I\nthink it really added something to an already\ngrate, sorry, great evening.\nDominic Conquest\nAh the famous problem of who is going to solo first, solution: no solos\nThe Grates (top); The Bishops (bottom)\nTOM WHITSON\nROBIN ANDREWS\n\n"

We all sat in a circle\nwith sweets and tea (and red wine\nin some cases) and discussed the\nplan of events for the weekend.\nNext morning, cold and sleepy, the\nteams prepared for a day of mixed\nhockey playing, and of course,\ndrinking. After a couple of hours\non the pitch, we made our way to a\nsleepy little pub for our curry and\nskittles lunch. At this point Shiv\ndecided she didn\u2019t like the blue bus\nvery much; showing her disgust by\nscraping it against a wall. (Note,\nlicking your fingers and wiping the\nscratch does not bring the paint\nback!)\nThe highlight of the afternoon\nwas when Jack\u2019s parents asked him\nwhere his bar name, \u201cDaterape\u201d,\ncame from. After a brief stop at\nsome shops to purchase our white\nT-shirts for the evening and to decorate them in style, we were ready to\nhit the town!\nIt may be a long time before Wells\nforget Imperial College Hockey\nclub. Funny stories include: Shiv\nhurling with extreme precision into\na glass, scandal as two nameless individuals took a friendly stroll down\na back alley, a certain male fresher\ngetting far too drunk and rolling in\nvarious hedges on the way home,\nan elegant female fresher taking a\nwee stop behind a fence and Roxy\ndemanding a kebab \u201ceven if it is\nmade of horse!\u201d.\nUnsurprisingly, hockey the next\nday was a little less than balanced.\nThere were many cries of \u201cI\u2019m going to throw up!\u201d and one poor fool\nfell in the mud on the way to the\nhockey pitch! This gave the opposition a slight advantage and both IC\nteams lost, unfortunately. However,\nwe all happily clambered back into\nour buses for the journey back and\npromptly fell into drunken, but contented sleep!\nFresh blood helps ensure Rugby 1st XV victory\nIt wasn\u2019t a normal start for the 1st\nXV this week, with a reshuffle of the\nteam that included seven new faces\non the starting team sheet, and the\nshock news that we would have to\ntake public transport to a game for\nthe first time since my arrival at uni-versity. And this meant that there\nwere no excuses for being late! As\nusual, few people arrived on time to\nmeet at the union; some even forgot\nto read their emails and had a quick\ndash to South Kensington tube to\nmeet up. But get there we did and\nwe were on our way to play GKT,\na side that has been in the league\nwith us for some time now.\nUpon arrival, the team had to\ntravel through some shrubbery before finally emerging at the sports\nground and the changing room.\nEveryone was in a some what subdued mood after the disappointing\nperformance last week, and so we\nwere ready to prove to ourselves\nhow good we can be. The warm up\nwent smoothly. We were all fired up\nfor the game and then we realised\nthat there was a mile trek to get to\nthe actual pitch!\nFrom the kick off, IC scored a\nquick try through Mike, who simply glided and then ran away from\nthe GKT defence, but this wasn\u2019t\nthe last time GKT would see Mike,\nas he went on to score a further\ntwo more tries in the half and thus\nimpressing his lady friend that accompanied him to the match. GKT\ndid however manage to get one try\nin the first half, with a simple catch\nand drive from the lineout, something which they are well known for\ndoing, but before the end of the half\nIC got a further try through Nathan\nto make the score at half time 22 \u2013 8\nto IC.\nThe second half started just the\nsame as it did in the first, except\nFlannan wasn\u2019t on the pitch, but\nwas instead having a little sulk on\nthe side line for being taken off to\ngive the fresher James Pettit a run.\nThroughout the half, IC continued\nwith their mouvement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\nwhilst GKT were unable to stop the\nsmooth, fast flowing, slick movement from both the forwards and\nbacks. But GKT continued with\ntheir own catch and drive, getting\na further two tries before the IC\nforwards figured out how to stop\nthem.\nIC were playing to a great stand-ard, with great co-operation be-tweentheforwardsandbackswhich\nresulted in a further three tries in\nthe half, with old man Andjit getting two and James Pettit getting\nthe other, leading to a final score\nof 25-39 to IC. There were some\ngreat performances from Dan \u2018not\nso little\u2019 Godfrey who managed to\ntake two guys out with his massive\ntackles, and also from \u2018Man of the\nMatch\u2019 Remi who was quick and\ndecisive over the field. In fact it was\ngenerally a massive improvement\nfrom last week, with even the forwards getting their act together.\nThe return journey turned out to\nbe a rather enjoyable one for both\nsides, as we got the same train\nback, but one must feel a little sorry\nfor the members of the poor general public who foolishly decided to\nget onto our carriage. GKT started\noff the festivities with \u2018sing fresher\nsing\u2019 to which their freshers obliged\nby serenading everyone to classics\nline Angel.

In this most\nunlikely of settings a day-long skirmish was taking place, one of several trips organised for members of\nICAirsoft on a termly basis.\nFor those unfamiliar with the intense world of Airsoft, it can be best\nthought of as paintballing\u2019s more\nserious sibling, with the paintballs\nreplaced by plastic ball bearings\nfired from replica firearms. A woodland skirmish basically consists of\ntwo teams in full camouflage gear\nrunning about a field/forest shooting at each other. In order to lend\na more tactical edge to the conflict,\nojectives are set for each team, forcing them to work together to crush\nthe opposition.\nA total of 6 of IC\u2019s finest were\nbrave enough to take on the world\n(and the 6a.m. wake up call in order\nto get there on time!). Even nonstop rain wasn\u2019t enough to put a\nstop to the proceedings, and by the\nend of the day everyone had enjoyed\na thorough soaking, along with several interesting mission scenarios.\nThese included an assault on a vehicle convoy and a mission to retrieve\nthe ingredients to make Snakebite,\nan activity more usually associated\nwith drunken Sports Nights at the\nUnion, which took on a whole new\ndimension whilst under enemy fire!\nEveryone performed well on the\nday, including several new members of the club, with this intrepid\nreporter (erstwhile ICAirsoft Treasurer) getting the chance to indulge\nin some lone-wolf Rambo-style\nshenanigans!\nDespite a slightly chaotic feel to\nthe proceedings, and the decidedly inclement weather, everyone\ninvolved had an enjoyable Sunday\nin the combat zone, and already the\nCommittee are working on plans\nfor the next excursion for ICAirsoft,\nwhich should be at the end of the\nChristmas term.\nFor more information, contact IC\nAirsoft at icairsoft@gmail.com\nKind of like pool, but with fingers\nPakSoc organise a carrom tournament; the game itself is likely to have begun in India, and is centuries old\nPast experience has shown that\nAsian societies at Imperial have a\nstrange tendency to largely host\nevents that are lacking a cultural fo-cus.

On the surface it may seem\nsimple but as Emerson, Felix\u2019s pho-tographer, will tell you, there is a\nlot more skill and mental rigour in-volved, as was also witnessed in the\nfinal matches of the tournament.\nThe winner of the tournament won\n30 pounds in cash with the second\nand third positions getting boxes of\nchocolates and a PakSoc pat on the\nback!

    "content": "Clamp down on student behaviour\nStudents at many universities have\nbeen forced to sign contracts to ensure good behaviour.\nIn Nottingham the two universi-ties, Nottingham and Nottingham\nTrent, have problems with the way\ntheir students get along with their\nneighbours. Drunkenness, vomiting and half eaten food litter appear\nto be the main irritants.\nA spokesman for Nottingham\nTrent university said: \u201cTo enhance\nthe relationship between student\nand community, we actively support\nthe \u201cSshh\u201d campaign \u2013 an initiative\ndesigned to educate students of the\nimportance of remaining respectful\nof the local communities and residents of Nottingham.\n\u201cThe campaign aims to deal with\nissues such as noise and litter but\nto also encourage students to feel\npart of the community rather than\nseparate from it.\u201d\nWhilst being educated, the students are also required to sign a\ncontract just as students arriving at\nChester and Oxford University do.\nOne in six students drop out of\nstudy at some point during their\ncourse. Most drop outs come from\nnew universities, established after\n1992. The cost to the taxpayer is estimated at around \u00a350 million.\nA spokesman for Chester University said: \u201cIt is our belief that a fair\nbalance should be struck between\nthe responsibilities of a university\nto provide a quality standard edu-cation, with well-qualified lecturers and first-class facilities, and\nreciprocal duties of students to participate actively in their studies by\nattending lectures, undertaking required preparation and submitting\nwork on time.\n\u201cThe document is designed to\nprotect the legitimate needs of our\nconscientious students, and to safeguard its resources from potentially\nvexatious claims.\u201d\nMeanwhile Dr Gillian Howie, a\nsenior lecturer at the University of\nLiverpool said: \u201cTwo league tables\ngiving a measure of university performance are retention and qualifying grades. There is an easily demonstrable relationship between\nattendance and grades.\n\u201cWe have to infantilise the young\nadult to ensure that they attend to\nsecure their grades.\n\u201cIn the main, these contracts try\nto make explicit the fact that learning is not something that can be\nbought and that it requires application on the part of the student.\u201d\nThere are voices of discontent on\nthe subject. Some believe university should be a liberating experience\nfrom the rigid rules set at school.\nOne of the most rewarding educational experiences of university\nis commonly said to be the way students must learn to balance their\nsocial life and their study to suc-ceed. The introduction of contracts\ncould water-down this experience\npotentially leading to less well-rounded graduates who are more\ndependent upon rules others set for\nthem to follow.\nThis is potentially bad for top employers who generally prefer applicants who have a certain level of\nindependence and take initiatives\nfor themselves.\nMarcel Berlins, a visiting professor of journalism at City University\nin London said: \u201cMost objection-ably, they remove from students\nthe right to exercise any discretion,\nto work out for themselves what\u2019s\nbest for them, to be responsible by\ntheir own volition and not because\nthey have been forced into it,\u201d\nWes Streeting, NUS vice-presi-dent for education was quick to\nmake a link with top up fees, he\nsaid: \u201cThis is a clear knee-jerk reaction to the introduction of top-up\nfees, which may result in more students making complaints as they\nseek to ensure they get full value\nfor their \u00a33,000.\n\u201cOur greatest worry is that\ncontracts could mean that students have no course to redress\nshould they have a substandard\nexperience.\n\u201cThe term \u2018contract\u2019 implies responsibilities on both sides. Unfortunately, while the contracts\nwe have seen outlined a number\nof requirements for students, they\nhave remained vague on what is\nrequired of universities in terms of\nstandards.\u201d\nThis contrasted with Dr. Howie,\nwho commented: \u201cDuring the last\n10 years universities have been\nsubjected to extraordinary measures to prove and evidence quality\nin teaching and research.\n\u201cDespite the fact that the length\nof the working week exceeds that\nwhich is recommended by Europe\nand stress suffered by academic\nstaff is amongst the highest in the\ncountry, we have remained committed and believe that education is\nkey to a vibrant economy and even\nmore importantly, to a flourishing\nway of life. \u201c\nDavid Ellis\nNews Editor\nA drunk student relaxes in the park after a stressful day of exams\nStudy shows grades do not\nreflect achievements\nAnewsurveyhasshowntheamount\nof time students from different universities have study to obtain the\nsame grades varies dramatically.\nOn average students from newer\nuniversities have to spend far less\ntime at their studies than at older\ninstitutions.\nScientists at Cambridge work 45\nhours a week on course related activities to obtain a top class degree,\ncompared to the 19 hours a week\nrequired to gain a first or 2:1 at University of Central Lancashire.\nThe study, performed by the\nHigher Education Policy Institute\n(HEPI) also revealed that whilst\nstudy-timevariedbetweensubjects,\nan even greater variation came in\nthe differences between courses.\nOn average students claim to\nspend 25.7 hours per week study-ing, but medicine and dentistry students work up to ten hours a week\nmore than the average, while mass\ncommunication students study five\nhours less than the average.\nThe study also focused on younger students. 15,000 first and second\nyear students were involved in the\nstudy, which also asked questions\nabout the work trends of third and\nfourth year students.\nThere are concerns that the degree grades are not a fair representation of the achievements of students on their courses. This could\ncause skewed intake to employers\nwhen students seek graduate jobs\nafter leaving university. Many in-stitutions, particularly those connected with the finance sector, use\ngrades as a screening method.\nHard-working students applying from scientific backgrounds at\nolder institutions, such as Imperial,\nmight be screened out, whilst less\nhard-working students from newer\nuniversities might get through the\ninitial screening procedures.\nThe finance sector employers\nrarely entirely disregard students\nwith lower grades. Normally employers warn applicants severely\nabout the limited chance they have\nof getting a job if they did not gain\nat least a 2:1 at university. There\nare real cases of applicants gaining competitive positions, such as\nat Investment Banks, without the\nrequired grades. Such applicants\noften have to resort to having some\nsort of exceptional experience that\nsells their talents and relegating\ntheir degree grades to the bottom\nof their CV just to get an interview.\nBahram Bekhradnia, of HEPI,\nsaid: \u201cIf students are putting 32\nhours a week into engineering and\n21 hours a week into business stud-ies, is a degree telling you the same\nthing about the universities and the\nexperience the students have had?\nYou can get a 2:1 with different\namounts of effort.\u201d\nDrummond Bone, of the vicechancellors\u2019 group Universities UK,\nsaid: \u201cThere is no national curriculum in higher education, and so we\nshould not be surprised that different courses at different institutions\ninvolve different use of facilities,\ncontact hours and so on.\u201d\nThe authors also noted that 60.9\nper cent of students of physical sciences at Plymouth University receive a 2:1 or first-class degree for\nworking 20 hours a week.\nNational decline in\nfemale applicants\nOut of the 48,138 UK applicants who\napplied for full-time study at university by 15th October, there were\n365 fewer women.\nThe trend is only an early indica-tion; the deadline for application is\n15th January. Some feel the trend is\nworrying since increases in student\nnumbers in recent years have been\nmainly due to an increasing number\nof female students, who now constitute around 55% of the UK total.\nThe early deadlines are for Oxbridge applicants whose numbers\nrose by 4.3%, apparently showing\nan \u201cimmunity\u201d to top up fee devel-opments. The figures also show a\n3.6% rise in foreign applicants with\napplicants from Poland up 28.5%.\nThe chief executive of UCAS, Anthony McClaran, said: \u201cOn balance,\nthese first figures for 2007 entry are\nencouraging.\u201d\nHigher Education Minister, Bill\nRammell said: \u201cThese figures show\nthe underlying trend in applica-tions, after the small reduction last\nyear and following a larger than\nusual increase the year before, continues to be upward.\n\u201cThe critics of the new fees sys-tem, who claimed applications\nwould plummet, are being proved\nwrong.\u201d\nThe \u201csmall reduction\u201d he referred\nto was the fall of the 2006 induction\nby 15,000 students. This put his\nclaims about the new fee system\ninto question.\nApplicants to England from\nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were down 9%, 2.1% and 4.3%.\nGemma Tumelty, President of\nNUS said that the government had\nportrayed the fall applications as \u201ca\nglitch\u201d, and added: \u201cWe genuinely\nhope they are right. We do not wish\nto see any more students missing\nout on the benefits a degree education can bring,\n\u201cThey may be able to pass off this\nyear\u2019s drop in applications as a one-off, but two years in a row would be\na clear and undeniable reflection of\nthe negative impact that top-up fees\nare having on participation rates.\u201d\nGraduates at Central Lancashire\nFemale students are already\nscarce at Imperial College\nAn appeal\nFelix is planning to look at the\neffects British foreign policy is\nhaving on students at college.\nIf you are an Imperial College\nstudent who is also a Palastinian, Israeli, Iraqi, Iranian of Afgahni national, and would value\nthe chance to take part in the\ninvestigation, then we would\nlike to hear from you.\nFeel free to send an email\nto David Ellis at news.felix@\nic.ac.uk.

I\u2019m\ngoing to dedicate the rest of this\ncolumn to a vitriolic rant, enjoy.\nAs you will read in our review of\nthis weekend\u2019s entertainment at\nFabric, last weekend was somewhat of a let-down for your poor\nnightlife editor, as my excursion\nto Fabric was cut rather short.\nWell, not \u2018short\u2019 exactly, since I\ndid spend a significant portion of\nFriday evening standing in the\nfrost-bound wasteland that is\nFarringdon. Although tantalising-ly close to the entrance after an\nhour and a half in the queue, we\nhad to say enough is enough and\nmake our sorry way home after\nbeing warned of at least another\n45 minutes waiting, which would\nhave pushed the total queuing\ntime up to the whopping two and\na quarter hours!\nAll in all, I didn\u2019t mind too much,\nsince I was kept entertained by\nmy lovely friends in the queue\n(on another note: I\u2019ve been told I\nhave to apologise for claiming my\nhouse\u2019s strobe light as my own\nin last week\u2019s issue, since only a\nquarter of the feeble black box is\nowned by me) and, of course, it\nwas sort of my fault for arriving\nso late in the first place, if thirty\nminutes after the club opens\ncould be considered \u2018late\u2019. What\ndid annoy me however is the\ncircumstances surrounding this\ngargantuan queue.\nFabric had decided not to sell\nadvance tickets for this event, so\nonly members of their paid subscription scheme Fabric First\ncould be guaranteed quick and\neasy entry. Sure, this rewards loyalty and that\u2019s good to an extent,\nbut they certainly didn\u2019t need any\nof that to attract people to this\nnight. What the scheme really\ndoes is alienate people who have\ncome for the music rather than\nthe club itself, which is surely a\nbetter reason for going.\nAfter having stood in the same\nspot in the regular queue for 40\nminutes, my friends and I were\nasked by a person in the Fabric\nFirst queue \u201cis this a drum and\nbass night?\u201d, which sums up my\nsentiments quite concisely.\nI love you really though, Fabric!\nIt\u2019s party\ntime once\nagain!\nAlex Baldwin\nNightlife Editor\nThe Belgians invade Fabric\nBelgium\u2019s finest export descend upon Fabric and they\u2019ve brought some friends too\nHooray, so we\u2019re back at Fabric\nagain, only this time it\u2019s a Friday\nnight, and I can drink to my heart\u2019s\ncontent. These guys have really\nbeen treating us recently, with Adventures In The Beetroot Field the\nweek before, which if you read the\nreview last week you\u2019ll know was\namazing, followed so closely by the\nmighty Radio Soulwax Weekender,\nwhich your dedicated reviewers\nmanaged to get over to and check\nout last Friday, and yes \u2013 it was super sweet.\nOn arrival, I must say that this\nwas definitely by far the most popular event I\u2019d ever seen happening at\nFabric, the main queue stretched\nall the way back to Farringdon\ntube station (which is a very long\nway indeed) with some dedicated\nfans waiting for up to 2 hours just\nto get in. Our beloved Alex unfortunately was one of them, but he decided to give up after an hour and a\nhalf when some guy from the huge\ncrowd of Fabric First members\nbeing allowed to join the queue in\nfront of everyone else asked if it\nwas a DnB night.\nThis event was definitely as popular as the Radio Soulwax event at\nCanvas a few months previously\nand, despite the huge queues, I\nmust say it was seriously better\norganised, since once entering\nthe club you could actually move\naround, and they didn\u2019t oversell it\nby 50% resulting in loads of people\nwho had already bought tickets not\nactually getting in (at least the people who went home disappointed on\nFriday hadn\u2019t also wasted \u00a325).\nAnyway, enough about that and\non with the actual club review. We\nmanaged to get in just before midnight which unfortunately meant\nwe missed a few acts including the\nhilarious Uffie doing a live set with\nher French DJ boyfriend Feadz.\nBased upon what she delivered the\nlast time I saw her playing live (and\nher horrendous new tracks Hot\nChick and In Charge) I wasn\u2019t too\nupset at missing her. Despite this,\nwe were lucky enough to catch the\nend of the Our Disco DJs\u2019 set which,\nby the looks of how packed the room\nwas for them, must have been pretty awesome. What we heard of it\ncertainly confirmed this, since they\npretty much played all my favourite\ntracks in a row (I can\u2019t wait for December 1st when they return). They\nwere a perfect support for Soulwax,\nsetting an awesome atmosphere in\nthe main room.\nNow, since I\u2019d seen Soulwax\nNiteversions at the Reading Festival last year I knew what to ex-pect: they were performing their\nNiteversions remix album live, but\nhaving seen them before made no\ndifference, the sound and lighting\nat Fabric were much better than\nReading, as was the atmosphere.\nThey were set up on stage in front\nof their trademark pink and white\nstripy background, with big spot\nlamps behind them, shining out to\nthe crowd. Room One was totally\npacked out with gyrating masses\nof people dancing to the guitar-led\nelectro and I must say it was pretty\ndamn fun. They performed all the\ntracks from the album, mixed together in the correct order which\nwas nice, since you knew what to\nexpect (I don\u2019t like surprises) and\nthe only thing that was a bit strange\nabout their set is that they didn\u2019t include any of the female vocals like\nthey did at Reading, which made\ntracks like E-Talking and NY Excuse sound a bit weird. Oh well,\nthey were great and they are still\ngreat.\nWe decided to hang around in\nRoom One some more, to catch\nMUSTAPHA 3000 aka Erol Alkan\nplay one of his sets. It was nice and\npretty similar to the one he played\nat the Escape Festival in Wales,\nmuch more electro in style than his\nTrash sets (predictably) although\nthere were a few remixes of some\nindie type tracks in there. At least\nI think so, although to be honest I\ndon\u2019t remember a single track he\nplayed, but we stayed around until\n2am so it can\u2019t have been that bad!\nWhen 2am finally came, it was\ntime for Vitalic, delivering his futuristic style of uber-electro. This\nwas going to be good! We arrived\njust in time for the start of his set;\nthe room was completely packed\nto maximum capacity, although we\nmanaged to push forwards into the\nmiddle, it was a bit of a squeeze.\nHe was standing on stage with\nonly his face visible, lit up with blue\nUV lights reflecting off his shiny\nbald head behind a big translucent\nscreen with crazy moving images\nprojected onto it.

Recently, a number of nations\nhave approved an addition to the\ntreaty, the Kyoto Protocol, which\nhas more powerful (and legally\nbinding) measures.

According to the\nEnergy Saving Trust (EST), 10% of\nthe UK\u2019s electricity bills (about \u00a3300\nmillion a year, or \u00a337 per household)\nis used by TVs, VCRs, and DVD\nplayers left on standby. This doesn\u2019t\ntake into account all the other culprits including mobile chargers,\nlaptop cables, stereos, and washing machines along with many oth-ers. Extra energy usage results in\nincreased carbon emissions, a gas\nthat has been shown to contribute\nto the greenhouse effect and consequently a global climate change.\nThe EST estimates that DVDs and\nVCRs produce more than a million\ntons of CO2 annually . While manufacturers can considerably reduce\nthe standby power of an appliance,\nfew do so despite a new voluntary\nEU initiative.\nSo what can we do about it? Any\nsteps individuals take will add to\nthe solution rather than the prob-lem, as well as saving on household\nenergy bills. For example, if every\nstandby button on TV sets and videos in the UK were switched off we\nwould save the power equivalent to\nthe annual output of a large power\nstation. And, if every household\nchanged just two ordinary light\nbulbs for energy efficient ones it\nwould save enough electricity each\nyear to power all the street lighting\nin the UK. The steps are small but\nthe impact could be huge. Other\ntips from the EST include:\n1. Turning your thermostat down\nby 1\u00baC could cut your heating bills\nby up to 10 per cent and save you\naround \u00a340 per year.\n2. If you\u2019re not filling up the washing machine, tumble dryer or dish-washer, use the half-load or economy programme\n3. Only boil as much water as you\nneed (but remember to cover the\nelements if you\u2019re using an electric\nkettle).\n4. Always turn off the lights when\nyou leave a room.\nImperial College\u2019s Environmental Society is currently planning\nits second Green Week; this year\u2019s\ntheme is Energy and the measures\nboth the college, its staff and students can take to reduce their energy usage including promoting the\n\u2018Power of Off\u2019. If you\u2019re interested\nin getting involved, in any area be\nit publicity, planning, design or just\nbeing an extra pair of hands during\nthe week email ic.esoc@gmail.com\nand we\u2019ll welcome you onboard!\nStreet lighting: changing two bulbs in every house to energy efficient bulbs could power this for a year\n\n"

    "content": "IC team beats Cambridge, MIT, Harvard, and Tokyo to second place in the prestigious iGEM competition\nPicture the scene. It\u2019s summer 2006.\nUndergraduates, exams successfully navigated, head off to roam the\nworld, free from the toil of university for three long months. But look\nclosely; there are still signs of life\nin the Bioengineering Department.\nHidden away in a small corner of\nthe building, a team of undergraduates and postgraduates are working\non a new research project in collaboration with Professors Richard\nKitney and Paul Freemont. Their\nbrief is a demanding one. In just ten\nweeks they have to show that simple biological systems can be built\nfrom standard, interchangeable\nparts and operated in living cells.\nThe results were presented at the\niGEM (international Genetically\nEngineered Machine) competition\nin Boston last weekend. On the eve\nof their flight to Boston, the team\ntook time out to talk to me about\ntheir work intensive summer.\nSo, why did eight undergraduates\ndecide to forego the pleasures of\nthe summer break to work on Imperial\u2019s iGEM entry? \u201cI don\u2019t think\nany of us had any idea how much\nwork was involved,\u201d admits Farah Vohra, a biomedical engineering student. \u201cBut the competition\nsimply sounded interesting,\u201d adds\nChristin Sander, also a student in\nbiomedical engineering.\nWithin a few short weeks, the\nteam had decided that they would\nattempt to build the world\u2019s first\nmolecular oscillator. Even to have\nreached such a decision so quickly\nwas impressive. \u201cGetting familiar\nwith the ideas was a huge hurdle,\u201d\nsays Farah. John Chattaway, a biology student agrees: \u201cwe spent the\nfirst week just finding out about\nsynthetic biology!\u201d This is an obvious problem for the team. In the\nUS, where the study of synthetic\nbiology began five years ago, many\nstudents are taught synthetic biological principles in their lectures.\nUS colleges choose their iGEM\nteams early in the year, giving\nthese teams a running start when\nthe competition begins. Will Imperial adopt a similar approach to this\nin future years? \u201cThat would be a\ngood idea. A very good idea,\u201d says\nFarah.\nBut back to the oscillator. I ask\nthe team to explain the potential\napplications of their system. \u201cIf we\ntreat the oscillator as a clock we can\ncontrol other things in the system;\nmake sure things happen at periodic times,\u201d Farah tells me. This\nconjures up images of a biological\ncomputer in my mind. Jiongjun Bai,\nan electronic engineering student,\nagrees:\u201cthiscouldrevolutioniseour\nway of thinking about materials. So\nin future we won\u2019t need transistors\nor semi-conductors; everything can\nbe built from biological materials.\u201d\nNot all of the iGEM teams have\nchosen this line of inquiry. \u201cMIT\nhave made some smelly bacteria,\u201d\nsays Farah. I\u2019m not sure quite what\nto make of this, but the examples\nare coming too thick and fast to\nraise questions: \u201cand Cambridge\nhave made some bacteria that\nfight. The culture changes colour\nImperial College wipes the floor\nas one population becomes dominant,\u201d Farah continues. \u201cIt\u2019s like a\nwar game,\u201d adds Jiongjun, \u201cthere\nare lots of innovative ideas. We are\nat the competition to impress.\u201d\nBut this is no ordinary compe-tition, I suggest. There is a surprising level of openness, with all\nteams providing regular progress\nupdates on the Internet. \u201cIt\u2019s all\non our wiki,\u201d Farah explains, \u201cso\nother teams can look at it and use\nit to help with their own research.\u201d\n\u201cYes, the competition promotes\nopenness,\u201d adds Christin, \u201cso everyone knows what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s\nnot a strict competition.\u201d\nA key feature of Synthetic Biology is its strong cross-discipline\napproach. The undergraduates on\nthe iGEM team are drawn from\nelectrical engineering, biomedical\nengineering, biology and biochem-istry. I wonder if it was easy to work\ntogether. \u201cIt\u2019s been an experience,\u201d\nsays Farah diplomatically. They all\nagree with this. Christin explains\nwhy this approach is important:\n\u201cthe concepts people bring with\nthem are different. And the way to\napproach a problem; that\u2019s different too. But that\u2019s the point. To try\nto gain the advantages of the different fields.\u201d I probe deeper into the\ncontrast between the engineering\nand biological approach. \u201cWe found\nthat the engineers were thinking\n\u2018OK, this is what I want to build\u2019, but\nthe biologists were working at the\nDNA level, thinking \u2018OK, but what\nhave we actually got, and what can\nwe do with it?\u2019 They had limitations\nin mind whereas the engineers\nGet involved\nprobably didn\u2019t,\u201d says Christin.\nThese contrasting perspectives\nare evident during the interview;\nthere are a number of disagreements about the answers to my\nquestions, reflecting the different\nacademic backgrounds on show.\nBut it always remains very friendly,\nan amazing accomplishment considering the team have been working together intensively for several\nweeks. I ask if the experience has\nbeen worthwhile. \u201cWe learnt a lot,\u201d\nsays Christin, \u201cnot just about synthetic biology, but about general\nresearch.\u201d My own undergrad summers were spent earning much-needed cash to pay for University.\nDid the experience gained make up\nfor this loss of earnings? \u201cOh, we did\nget paid,\u201d John corrects me. \u201cYes,\nbut it wasn\u2019t proportional to the\ninput though,\u201d comments Farah.\nTruly, then, these undergrads have\nlearnt some valuable lessons about\nthe nature of scientific research.\nAs Felix was going to press, we\nheard that the Imperial iGEM\nteam had been named the overall first runner-up at the competition in Boston, beating many other\nwell established teams along the\nway. They also won first prize in\nthe Best Documentation and Best\nMeasurement and Part Characterisation Categories. This is a fantastic achievement for the team, considering that this is the first year\nthey have taken part in the contest..\nNinth university in the world? After\nthis week\u2019s iGEM competition, the\nother eight had better start watching their backs.\nThe victorious Imperial team: weighed down with certificates and trophies after entering the world\u2019s first molecular oscillator into the iGEM competition\nLooking for something to do\nthis summer? Want to get involved with the fastest growing\nnew science since the dot-com\nrevolution? Imperial College is\nnow recruiting team members\nfor its entry to the 2007 iGEM\ncompetition. Students from\nall disciplines will work on the\nproject over the summer before jetting off to present their\nwork at the annual Jamboree\nat MIT in November.\niGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) is a\ncompetition set up to explore\nwhat it is that makes things\nalive \u2013 whether or not we can\njust break life up into a series\nof constituent components.\nInvolving all disciplines\nfrom biology to engineering,\nit involves trying to \u2018engineer\u2019\nbiological devices by using\nstandardized parts called \u201cBioBricks\u201d. New Biobricks are\nreleased every year as the science advances, so each year\nstudents are working on the\ncutting edge.\nVisit http://parts2.mit.edu/\nwiki/index.php/Imperial_Col-lege_2006 to read more about\nthis year\u2019s entry or send an\nemail to igem.imperial2007@\ngmail.com for more information about this year\u2019s entry.\n7\nfelix\nFriday 10 November 2006\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nColin Barras\n\n"
