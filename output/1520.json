    "content": "FILM\nFELIX Friday 01 JUNE 2012 23\nbut never forgotten\n3. Dumb Blonde Comedies: Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), The Seven Year Itch (1955)\nReplacing Betty Grable in what would arguably become one of the most famous roles of her career, Monroe\nwas required not only to act, but to sing and dance in Gentlement Prefer Blondes, playing a gold-digging show-girl. \u2018Diamonds Are a Girl\u2019s Best Friend\u2019\u2019s original performer was none other than Monroe (i.e. NOT Nicole\nKidman) and the film was a success both critically and commercially witht critics praising Monroe\u2019s diversity\nof talent. She followed this up with How to Marry a Millionaire, a light-weight comedy about three women\n(Monroe, Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall) looking for rich men for them to settle down with. Her hugely popular\ndumb blonde persona was further used with The Seven Year Itch, the film responsible for creating one of\nMonroe\u2019s most iconic movie shots, the skirt-blowing scene. And with this series of repeated successes she\nwas named one of the top ten money making stars.\n4. Transition to Drama:\nBus Stop (1956)\nIn 1955 she was accepted to\nstudy at the Actors Studio under Lee Strasberg who agreed\nto have her as a student. He\nlater commented that of all\nthe actors he had trained,\nonly two have truly stood out\nfrom the rest. The first was\nMarlon Brando, the second\nbeing Monroe. Her dedication\nto method acting and desire\nto turn to more dramatic roles\nlanded her a role in Bus Stop,\nas a saloon singer who falls\nfor a cowboy. The film won\nrave reviews for Monroe, with\ncritics pleasantly surprised to\nsee the actress perform so\nwell in such an unexpected\ngenre. Although her performance was campaigned for\nan Oscar nomination, she\nfailed to receive one. She\nwas however, nominated for a\nGolden Globe.\n5. Declining Health: The Prince and the Showgirl (1957)\nThroughout her career, Monroe was known for her shyness and stage\nfright, which caused frequent delays to productions. Following personal struggles that stemmed from divorces and miscarriages, she\nstarted relying heavily on alcohol and barbiturates, a combination\nwhich started spiralling out of control even on film sets. During the\nfilming of The Prince and the Showgirl, her co-star and director Sir\nLaurence Olivier clashed with Monroe, and the English acting royalty\nfound himself infuriated with the actress. She did however, win over\nthe critics and audience particularly of Europe with this performance,\nwinning a David di Donatello award (the Italian equivalent of the Oscars) as well as a nomination for a BAFTA.\n6. Some Like it Hot (1959)\nPaired up again with director Billy Wilder, he knew better than anyone else of Monroe\u2019s erratic behaviour\nhaving worked with her on The Seven Year Itch. During the production of Some Like it Hot, he noted how unpredictable she had become, turning up to the set hours late, and often not at all, and her severe forgetfulness\nthat on one occasion required him to take over 50 shots for a simple scene. She failed to get along with her\nco-star Tony Curtis and her behaviour grew hostile. Her uncooperative attitude has since become something\nof a legendary folklore in the film industry, with some grossly exaggerated anecdotes, but what remains clear\nis that this was not an easy process. The film nevertheless, was a resounding sucess. Monroe herself was\npraised for her seductive performance, winning her only Golden Globe of her career.\n7. Last Completed Film: The Misfits (1961)\nMonroe\u2019s health declined even further in 1960, during which the production for The Misfits had started. She\nwas frequently unable to perform, and ended up hospitalised for ten days. Monroe was not the only cast\nmember with struggling health. Montgomery Clift, a notorious alcohol and drug user, was in terrible shape,\nand Clark Gable also became unwell, passing away before the film\u2019s release, one of many factors that contributed to her deterioration in psychological well-being. She was fired from the set of her next movie, Something\u2019s Got to Give due to her inability to meet her schedule, only to be re-hired eventually. But the production\nwas permenantly ceased when Monroe was found dead at her home aged 36, 5 August 1962. Around 30\nminutes of footage remains of Monroe in her uncompleted film.\n\n"

    "content": "music.felix@gmail.com\nMusic Editors: \u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nRoss Gray Mark England\nMUSIC\nFELIX Friday 01 june 2012 21\nAlex Ramadan\nSimon Hunter\nO\nne lazy summer eve-ning, I proposed to my\nfriends that we check\nout a jazz bar just down\nthe street from our place,\nbut which we had never been to in two\nyears of living there. Le QuecumBar is\na 1930s inspired gypsy jazz bar which\nhosts some of the best known players\nof the style first performed by the now\nlegendary Jean \u201cDjango\u201d Reinhardt.\nDjango (whose nickname means \u201cI\nawake\u201d in Romani) was born in Belgium in 1910 to Romanian parents, before moving to Paris where he learned\nthe banjo, and later the guitar, becoming absorbed in the music of the time.\nHis virtuous, often said \u201chot\u201d, guitar\nplaying laid the cornerstones for a style\nwhich now reminds of silent movies\nin fast forward or smoky alleys in the\ndeep Parisian night, drowned in gaiety\nand inebriation.\nA friend I met during my second year\nat college had once told me about this\nplace. He played in the IC Big Band\nand would often come to the QuecumBar\u2019s Tuesday jam sessions to burn\nthe night away. Gypsy jazz has always\nseemed to me a very wholesome style,\nnot unlike Jamaican dub or even drum\n& bass. Stylistically it does not need\ngreat scope to do what it does. To the\nnovice ear, all the songs might sound\nthe same, perhaps somewhat like Disney\u2019s Aristocats throwing a double\nbirthday party. It is a fiery music that\nburns very brightly. The atmosphere is\nimmediate. I imagine it might go very\nwell in the summer with a coffee and\na croissant around 6am before an after-party up Mont Martre. Though to understand why you might want a coffee\nbefore closing a night out you will have\nto listen for yourself.\nAs we walked in just shy of 8 o\u2019clock,\nthere was one lady in long feline spectacles sitting by the window and three\nmusicians warming up in a corner. We\nwere greeted by a waiter in piano key\nsuspenders offering dinner or drinks. In\nthe spirit of procrastination we opted\nfor liquid dinner of the gourmet kind.\nBelgian blonde Leffe for my friend,\nCzech Budvar for myself (that golden\npilsner our humble Union has so woefully forgotten in favour of the AmeriA night at Le QuecumBar\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto finds a passage to 1930s Paris down Battersea High Street\n\u201cSomewhat like\nDisney\u2019s Aristocats\nthrowing a double\nbirthday party\u201d\ncan dribble). The only other people in\nthe place, a couple sat for dinner, were\npresented with the evening\u2019s menu on\na billboard over a metre high which \u2013\nwhen stood on the floor \u2013 was entirely\nvisible from behind the table.\nAfter ordering, the three musicians\nmade their way to the stage in front of\nus. Crammed atop it were four red velvet chairs that could just about fit three\npeople. Behind them were plants of all\nforms, all a deep green; a botanical salad analogous to the societal metaphor.\nThe wall behind them was the yellow of\na century gone by, lined with the golden\nframes of photographs which bore witness to the scores of gypsy zealots who\nhad passed through this place. Among\nthem, innumerable portraits of Django\nand a street sign that read \u201cSt. Germain\ndes Pr\u00e8s\u201d. By the stage was a disused\nfireplace inside which sat a bouquet\nof dry flowers, the sort that flourish in\ndroughts. Candles lined all corners of\nthe room, while chandeliers and fans\nhung brazen from the ceiling.\nAs the music begun, a second guitarist joined the group, perching his leg\nup on the stage for want of room to sit.\nEarlier I had overheard him speaking\nwith the feline dame, saying he was\nHungarian in somewhat broken English. It seemed somehow charming that\nhe had come here to play a century old\nstyle of Romani-French music. As he\nplayed along, the female violinists exchanged solos before handing over the\nhonours to the men\u2019s curiously shaped\nguitars. The music resembled courteous\nsmall talk caught in a four-way flirt.\nA slow shadow swept over my left\nshoulder. Three seasoned ladies made\ntheir way to the dining table closest\nto the stage. The eldest marked a frail\nfigure beneath a hefty black coat. When\nshe reached the table and removed her\ncovering, the golden lights from the\nceiling reflected on the purple sequins\nof her dress. She wore a silver necklace\nand a spectacular turquoise ring. There\nwas a look of rejuvenation in her eyes.\nPerhaps this music had been her passion in younger years. If it is so nostalgic to someone of our time, I can only\nimagine how it might feel to someone\nwho lived it during its prime.\nSoon thereafter, more people started\nto arrive and the air filled with commotion as the jam went on. Like the ladies\nbefore, now a massive upright bass\ncrept past my left shoulder and joined\nthe song midway, suddenly giving it\nnew character. The smell of delicious\nstew flew from the kitchen. The waiter\ncame back, \u201canother Leffe, sir?\u201d and\nmore musicians approached the stage.\nAfter a couple of drinks, while\nsearching for the gents\u2019 I discovered a\nbeer garden at the back. The walls were\nworn and decorated with murals of art\nnouveau. A straw hat that hung on one\nof the walls had been converted into a\nbird house. Later when I left I would\nnotice a banner outside announcing an\n\u201cexotic oasis and tropical patio\u201d. This\nmust be the place.\nThe ambience was intoxicating, as\nperhaps our dinner too. I felt an impulse\nto write down what was happening on\nthe nearest piece of paper, as the beer\nmight later betray my memory. While\nI wrote through another drink, half the\nmusicians had been replaced by twice\nas many more. It seemed I had underestimated the gussed up stage.Athird guitarist found a way to capitalize on the\nfourth chair, while an accordion player\nwhose instrument read \u201cVictoria\u201d sat at\nthe front. One of the lady violinists was\nnow replaced by a lad in his late teens\nwith unkempt hair, wearing denim on\ndenim and Nikes that looked like Vans.\nThe bassist, whose curled goatee must\nhave been longer than my beer glass,\nwaved his hand in circles at a friend offering to relay the rhythm section.\nThe musicianship on display that\nnight was as much an exhibition of\nvirtuosity as an exercise in endurance.\nWhen one guitarist dropped his pick,\nhis absence was immediately noticeable through the thicket of the six-strong sound that reverberated from the\nhollow bodied instruments. Everyone\nplayed in unison at a dizzying speed. At\ntimes the violins were strummed like\nmandolins, making way to a frenzy of\nsix-stringed resonance.\nAfter a few songs, the bassist put\nhis piece down, revealing an armful of\ntattoos as he clutched his music book.\nWhen the band resumed, they did so\nwith a more solemn sound, marking the\ndeparture of the booming absentee. After a moment of silence, the first guitarist swung a sentimental tone reducing\nthe tempo to a fraction. For a moment\nit felt like listening to the morning radio through the kitchen doorway and\nas the beer ebbed through my corpus\nI remembered this place was an island\nin time. Decked in the d\u00e9cor of the era,\ninfused with the sound of nostalgia. An\nexotic oasis as promised from the out-side, right in the heart of Battersea.\nOne jam ended beautifully with the\ntwo remaining violinists caught in a\nsoft duet which enthralled the others to\na rest. A burst of applause prefaced the\nburning pace of the next song. Howls\ncame from the crowd and fists stomped\non the tables. The smell of coffee at ten\npast ten. The room was on fire!\nThe music hardly stopped the whole\nnight. If anything, they just seemed\nto play faster and faster as the hours\nwent on, squared off against the night\nas if refusing sleep. The bearded bassist slapped his strings, nearly snapping\nthem off. The others formed gangs,\nthree guitars ripping through one riff,\ntwo violinists another, one lone accordion standing its ground. When the\nflurry was over, the newest guitarist in\nthe group, the fourth that night, panted.\nBreaking the pace, the group got\nstarted on \u2018Blue Drag\u2019. This shot my\nheart back a few strides. This was one\nof the first songs I had heard of Django.\nI remembered the mornings digging\nthrough my father\u2019s jazz collection during breakfast, memories now infused\nwith the taste of toast and coffee.\nI left the place having written on the\nback of seven flyers, each advertising a seemingly unique performance\non nearly every night of the week. On\nthe 10th and 11th of June, the Moscow Drug Club would blend \u201c1930s\nBerlin cabaret, hot club de France,\nNew Orleans funeral parade & gypsy\ncampfire songs\u201d. Among numerous\nParisian cabaret performances would\npass the Kalotaszeg Trio from the Carpathian forests of Transilvania on the\n14th. Come the 18th, The Boomtown\nSwingalings would be bringing the\n\u201csweet sounds of swing\u201d to life down\nthe Battersea joint. Finally, on the 24th,\nPaprika, a Balkan super-group \u201cflying\nthe folk flag for a largely anonymous\ncode of music\u201d would grace the stage\nafter having passed through Glastonbury festival, Edinburgh Fringe and\nRoyal Albert Hall.\nDinner is served from 6 until 10 and\njudging by the amount of couples in the\naudience, it seems like a perfect place\nto surprise your better half. Cover costs\naround \u00a310 depending on the evening,\nthough of course the jam nights on\nTuesdays are free and open to anyone\nwith the spirit of Django.\n42-44 Battersea High Street, SW11\n3HX\n\u201cThe music\nresembled courteous\nsmall talk caught in\na four-way flirt.\u201d\nBohemian levels are currently through the roof\n\n"

So why is it\nthat when presented with the opportunity\nto congregate amidst a sea of tuxedos\nand ball gowns over a three course meal\nat Imperial, there are many opting out of\nending the year over dinner at Imperial? Or\neven more pressingly, why aren\u2019t students\naccepting what the Union has changed for\nthem specifically?\nThis year\u2019s formal dinner is due to be\nheld in the Senior Common Room at a cost\nof \u00a340, while entertainment tickets cost\n\u00a335 to see the likes of Ms Dynamite and\nelectro swing outfits perform.\nThough the change to a festival format\nin 2011 was the result of a decline in the\nsale of formal dinner tickets year-on-year,\nthis year\u2019s formal dinner tickets mark a decrease in cost. Whereas in 2010 a formal\ndinner ticket would set one back by \u00a385\n(rising to \u00a390), this year saw joint tickets\nrise from \u00a370 to \u00a375.\nFollowing last year\u2019s change in format\nfrom its prior formal beginnings, a common concern was that the Summer Ball,\nabove all, \u201cshould be about having a special evening with our friends\u201d as summarized by one individual. One commenter\nfrom our Summer Ball survey last year remarked that \u201cto celebrate the end of our\ntime at Imperial, we don\u2019t really want big-name bands.\u201d\nGroups of students have suggested holding their version of a formal dinner else-where, whether privately at home or at a\nrestaurant, though with some openly admitting that the price of their own events\n\u201ccould match that of the formal dinner\nitself\u201d, there must be further reasoning\nbehind why the formal dinner is not an\ninstant-buy prospect. A range of reasons\ncould immediately be raised, from the pric-ing, however reduced, to the location.\nFeedback was the reasoning behind\nensuring that the festival format was removed for this year. The Union have openly\nchanged the format, yet the formal dinner\nhas reverted to pre-2011 enthusiasm.\nWhile some consider the Summer Ball to\nbe \u201can integral part of the university experience\u201d, as the deadline approaches\nfor the formal dinner tickets, we will see\nwhether Imperial will recall its past desire\nfor a formal dinner, and whether students\nwill buy into a format that they actively had\na part in organising.\nThe Summer Ball you\nasked for\nDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019ve put a new facade on Mech Eng so it now looks as good as this...\nIt\u2019s just College\ndoesn\u2019t seem to\nhave any strategy\nregarding\nplanning and\ninvesting in\nfuture Silwood\nstaff and\nstudents\n\u201c\nIt\u2019s jus\nIt\u2019s jus\ndoesn\u2019\ndoesn\u2019\n\u201d\nF\nollowing last week\u2019s Felix\nstory about Silwood Park, I\nfelt it was important to write\nabout what it\u2019s actually like\nhere at Silwood, which,\nuniquely for a London based univer-sity, is outside of London. Having been\na student here and South Kensington I\nhave found that they are very different.\nWith 160 students, 60 academic staff,\nand over 100 hectares of parkland,\nthere\u2019s lots more space than at a London\ncampus. I am writing this outside in the\nsun, surrounded by flowering rhodo-dendrons, and in the distance there is a\nlab group having their meeting by our\nlily pond, it is really beautiful. In 2009,\nCampus Dean Mick Crawley said to Reporter that it is \u201csuch a luxury to be able\nto do my fieldwork within a few yards\nof the laboratory\u201d. We also have a small\nfriendly community, where you can actually get to know almost everyone\u2019s\nname, both staff and student.\nThere are, however, some downsides\nto being here; sadly I don\u2019t believe that\nthe campus\u2019s uniqueness makes up for\nthe lack of investment in our social\nand recreational facilities. We do have\na shiny new teaching building, but our\nhalls are only just adequate. We have a\ndingy squash court, weedy tennis court,\nand a tiny gym, which to be honest feels\nlike you are exercising in a nuclear bun-ker. The refectory, bar and social room\nbuildings were built for temporary use\nabout 60 years ago; they\u2019ve done well\nto still be standing but frequently leak\nand are freezing in winter. Added to\nthat, they are not big enough to hold all\nof our students at once.\nWhy don\u2019t we come up to the Union\nand go to GSA events at South Kensington? It can be a four hour round trip\nby train, and the last one leaving Waterloo is fairly early compared with when\nan average night out finishes; as we all\nknow, train and tube fares are not cheap.\nWe do have our Union minibus at Silwood, but we give priority to supermarket trips (the nearest is a 30 minute walk\naway), and activities, which inevitably\nclash with events. Recently we\u2019ve borrowed a second minibus, which has\nbeen great, but we\u2019re not sure if we\u2019ll\nstill have it next year.\nAnother issue here is welfare. In a\nsmall community people form close\nbonds and it can be very supportive.\nOn the other hand it can be fairly gos-sipy, news gets around between staff\nand students, so if you want some time\nout it\u2019s not easy. I\u2019ve had quite a few\npeople asking me this year whom they\ncan talk to about issues affecting their\nwork and mental health. In most cases\nI\u2019ve directed them to someone who can\nhelp, but the fact that they ask, shows\nme that the relevant services just don\u2019t\nseem available.\nThings have not been helped by the\nresignation of several staff members\nand hearing that more are considering\ntheir positions. Regarding the Applied\nEcology courses discontinuing due to\nstaff leaving, as I said I am sad that\nthese courses are going, though it is\nencouraging that they will continue at\nanother institution. They have been at\nSilwood Park in some form for over 50\nyears, whilst the remaining ones started\nwithin the last eight: we are passing a\nmilestone here in Silwood history.\nOverall, I feel there has been a bit of\na negative atmosphere across campus.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, we do have some\nfun here, from our annual music festival\nSilfest to our comedy \u2018homage\u2019 to the\nstaff at the Silwood Revue, we can be\nimaginative in entertaining ourselves\nover the year. It\u2019s just College doesn\u2019t\nseem to have any strategy regarding\nplanning and investing in future Silwood staff and students. Why hasn\u2019t\nthis been complained about more? I\nthink because staff are often reluctant\nto stick their necks out, as, understand-ably, they think that their jobs may be in\njeopardy if they do. Students, on Biology related courses, are used to working and living in the field and making\ndo with basic facilities.\nPart of me wonders, probably naively,\nwhy should we have to be lobbying for\nthings to improve? Shouldn\u2019t College\nalready be ensuring that we have the\nbest possible experience? Either way,\nit seems College is finally realising that\nthings need to be improved, perhaps\naware that fees here are increasing by\n78% and students will expect more\nbang for their buck. This week I attended the first meeting of the Silwood\nAction Group, a College Working Party\nlooking into the student experience at\nSilwood. This didn\u2019t really focus on the\nlongterm picture for Silwood, as I was\nanticipating, but I\u2019m hopeful that this\ndiscussion is the start of a transition,\nor more appropriately, an \u2018evolution\u2019\nof Silwood Park. There\u2019s a new MRes\ncourse starting here in October, lecturer\npositions replacing the leaving staff\nare being advertised soon, the Reactor\nCentre is beginning a decommissioning\nphase and there are exciting proposals for research to return to the Manor\nHouse, which has been empty for the\nlast three years.\nI originally started at Imperial back in\n2003, in that time South Kensington has\nimproved so much, particularly in facilities and support. I am really hoping that\nthis can happen at Silwood and I look\nforward to the campus in years to come.\nDon\u2019t just\nwrite your\nopinions\ndown on\nyour exam\npaper, email\nthem to us\n(probably not\nwhile you\u2019re\nin an exam\nthough, just\na thought)\ncomment.\nfelix@impe-rial.ac.uk\n\n"

However,\nsome experts think this is \u2018too little, too late\u2019, and\nthat the company may have to resort to more extreme measures, for example licensing their proprietary operating system to other phone manufactur-ers. Only time will tell whether or not RIM can pull\nthemselves back into the land of profit.\nThe Kana: a mouse for all\nFELIX\nFriday 01 june 2012\n15\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\nTECHNOLOGY\nThe Pirate Bay blocked by ISPs\nAt the end of last month, leading UK Internet Service Providers were ordered by UK courts to prevent their customers from accessing the popular\ntorrent site The Pirate Bay. Virgin Media began\ntheir block just two days later, whereas BT have\nasked for \u201ca few more weeks to consider its position\u201d. This is something of a landmark occasion\nfor anti-piracy campaigning in the UK, as it is likely\nany similar bans will pass through the courts with\nsome ease after this first occurrence. However,\nThe Pirate Bay themselves couldn\u2019t care less. The\nday following the ban, they claimed to have had\n12 million visitors more than their previous record.\nAlong with advice on how to bypass the ban, they\nare quoted as saying \u201cWe should write a thank you\nnote to the BPI\u201d with regards to the extra traffic.\nThe problem with all this is almost all users of the\nsite will easily bypass the ban, supporters of a\ncompletely open internet will be riled by the deci-sion, and the copyright holders have \u2013 in effect\n\u2013 gained nothing.\ncursor/gun/whatever did it too, with no skips\nor jumps.\nMy only minor (and it is minor) gripe with\nthe Kana is that the side buttons are almost a\nlittle too easy to press. Sometimes when I put\nmy hand back on the mouse, I would accidentally hit the button on the right-hand side. Certainly not the biggest deal in the world, but it\ncould be a nuisance if that button were mapped\nto something important.\nOther than that, I find it very difficult to\nfault this mouse. It has great performance, and\nticks the boxes of both comfort and aesthetic\nappeal. The software adds rather than detracts\nto the package as well, allowing unlimited\nprofiles, easy button mapping, and even a heat\nmap of how much you press each button over\nsome time period. Oh, and did I mention the\nscroll wheel is illuminated on each side (which\ncan have different brightness settings based on\nthe active profile)? How cool is that!\nIf you\u2019re looking for a reliable, high-per-formance gaming mouse for around \u00a340, the\nSteelSeries Kana may well be for you.\nall manner of coiling and use, and promises to\nbe tangle-free.\nSo the mouse looks good, and feels good,\nbut how does it perform? I used it as my\nmouse for a week, for general use as well as\ngaming \u2013 including Call of Duty, where a slip\nof the mouse can be the difference between\nlife and death. Regardless of the surface I was\nplaying on \u2013 be it my multi-coloured mouse\nmat or the seat of the sofa \u2013 the Kana didn\u2019t\nmiss a beat. The sensor within is evidently of\nvery high quality. Whatever my hand did, my\nThe SteelSeries Kana is a gaming mouse\npromising a good specification but at a reasonable price. Armed with a high resolution\nsensor (3200dpi), two side buttons, two onboard profiles and a resilient, braided cable, it\ncertainly looks good on paper. I\u2019ve been using\nit for the past week, so let\u2019s take a look at how\nit is in practice.\nFirst impressions were good \u2013 the Kana is\ncertainly a striking mouse. Whichever colour\nyou choose (it\u2019s available in white/black and\nblack/orange), the contrast looks great. However, the colour doesn\u2019t really impact how\ngood the mouse is, but thankfully SteelSeries\nhasn\u2019t sacrificed in that department to deliver\non prettiness.\nThe Kana is an ambidextrous mouse \u2013 completely symmetrical. While this took a while\nto get used to (I usually use an ergonomic\nmouse), once over that bump the mouse is\ncomfortable, and you could definitely use\nit for hours of continuous play. This design\nmeans there\u2019s a large button on each side of\nthe mouse, which can be mapped in-game or\nusing the SteelSeries Engine software.\nThe rest of the buttons are as you\u2019d expect,\nwith the addition of a profile toggling button\n\u2013 which allows you to switch between two\non-board sensitivity settings on the fly. This\nall connects to your computer with a braided,\ndurable cord, which feels like it will survive\nChris Bowers\nWho can resist an orange glowing scrollwheel?\nA company has produced a new USB device,\ndubbed Leap, that creates an interaction space\nof 8 cubic feet in which hand gestures up to\nan accuracy of 0.01 millimeters can be recog-nised. The company, Leap Motion, uses technology which proves cheaper than the current\nstate of the art: Microsoft\u2019s Kinect sensor.\nThe technology, predicted to work with either a higher resolution camera or by using infrared Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR),\nis about \u2018two-hundred times more accurate\nthan existing products and technologies on the\nmarket\u2019, reports the manufacturer.\nThe Leap device is expected to ship next year\nfor roughly $70, and the technical details behind its operation are kept secret by Leap Motion, who only cite a \u2018patented mathematical\napproach\u2019 in their methods. The methods used\nin improving the device will start to emerge\nin the public domain as developers eventually\nget their hands on the Leap, and the company\nlooks set to take the direction of Microsoft\nwith their Kinect sensor, opening it up for the\nmasses to use to improve their wide variety of\napplications - from research to leisure.\nLeap\u2019s use case extends to a plethora of\ntechnological applications, including virtual\ngesture based keyboards in mobile devices and\nfuturistic, accurate navigation in desktops. The\ndevice gives rise to questions about the future\nof touch and gesture based navigation in current technology and has the potential to usher\nin an era of Minority Report style computer\ncontrol.\nKana reasonably priced gaming mouse perform?

    "content": "FEATURE\nFELIX Friday 01 JUNE 2012 9\nnterfering at Hogwarts\nsses the Government\u2019s latest assault on academic freedom, through the Research Councils\nhave impact if the pathways are right\u201d.\nMake of that what you will.\nWhat the future holds\nThe councils today look much\nlike you\u2019d expect after 30 years of\n\u201cchange\u201d. In the EPSRC, for instance,\nhalf of the council is made up of \u201cindustry representatives,\u201d as the box\n(right) shows.\nTwo weeks ago, nine Nobel laureates\nsent an angry letter to the Telegraph\ncalling, stating that, \u201cthe EPSRC is\nfailing to maintain Britain\u2019s global\nresearch standing,\u201d and (appealing to\nthe Telegraph\u2019s natural readership)\naccused it of \u201csquandering British taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\u201cThrough manipulating the processes of peer review to meet policy objectives and establishing favouritism\nschemes, where substantial funding\npackages are given to a few selected\nindividuals identified by its own ad-ministration, the EPSRC is no longer\nallocating funds on a fair and transparent basis,\u201d said the letter.\nIn other words, allowing businesspeople and Government ministers to\ndecide what to fund leads to \u201cfavouritism\u201d and unfair distribution of fund-ing. Should it come as any surprise that\nbusiness-people want to fund particular areas (their own areas) at the expense of others? Should it come as any\nsurprise that the Government\u2019s agenda\ndoesn\u2019t coincide with what is best for\nthe country?\nIn September 2011, twenty-five\nhigh-profile mathematicians sent a\nletter to the Prime Minister complaining that the \u201cEPSRC\u2019s model is one of\ncentral planning and micro-managing\nresearch. Civil servants in an unaccountable quango are picking winners,\ndeciding which science to fund based\non their perception of strategic priori-ties. They call it Shaping Capability.\u201d\nThe letter argued that the Council\u2019s\nrefusal to consult actual scientists was\n\u201clikely to cause irreversible damage\u201d\nto science in Britain.\nProfessor Richard Thomas of Imperial has also spoken out against the\nCouncil. \u201cEPSRC often measures the\nquality of an area of mathematical re-search, or of an individual researcher,\nby the amount of EPSRC funding it\nhas received,\u201d he said, in a letter to\nthe EPSRC. \u201cThere is a real risk of unfairly directing funding to those have\nreceived EPSRC funding in the past.\u201d\nAh yes, this is what the EPSRC calls\n\u201cdeveloping leaders\u201d.\nReferring to Mathematics in particu-lar, he laments that people who \u201chave\nno training in mathematics whatsoever,\nare being forced to decide the level of\nfunding to areas of mathematics whose\nnames they can hardly understand.\u201d\nA general picture is emerging here\nof a Government wanting to exercise\nmore control over universities, and to\nlet businesses profit while the country\nsuffers.\nIn true neo-liberal style, the idea that\nuniversities (those pillars of civilisa-tion) are sacred and should be exempt\nfrom the flawed and hostile world of\nshort-termist money-making appears\nto have not occurred to our dear Government. Indeed, the desire to prove\nthat Britain is \u201copen for business\u201d\nthreatens all academia, the one area\nin which the UK really does lead the\nworld.\nIt is only appropriate, then, given the\nsignificance of this matter, to end with\na remarkably apt quotation:\n\u201cEvery headmaster and headmistress\nof Hogwarts has brought something\nnew to the weighty task of governing\nthis historic school, and that is as it\nshould be, for without progress there\nwill be stagnation and decay. There\nagain, progress for progress\u2019s sake\nmust be discouraged... A balance, then,\nbetween old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition\nand innovation because some changes\nwill be for the better, while others will\ncome, in the fullness of time, to be recognised as errors of judgement,\u201d said\nProfessor Umbridge.\n\u201cMeanwhile, some old habits will be\nretained, and rightly so, whereas oth-ers, outmoded and outworn, must be\nabandoned. Let us move forward, then,\ninto a new era of openness, effectiveness and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved,\nperfecting what needs to be perfected,\nand pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited.\u201d\n\u201cThere was some important stuff\nhidden in the waffle,\u201d said Hermione\ngrimly. \u201c\u2018Progress for progress\u2019s sake\nmust be discouraged...pruning wherever we find practises that ought to be\nprohibited.\u2019 It means the Ministry\u2019s interfering at Hogwarts!\u201d \u2013 Harry Potter\nand the Order of the Phoenix\nA fully referenced version of this article is available at rustylight.blogspot.\ncom\nNext week, I\u2019ll be discussing the career\nadvice offered at Universities across\nthe UK, and exploring why so many\nstudents claim to be unhappy with it.\n\u201cIndustry representatives\u201d on the EPSRC:\nPaul Golby, former director of E.ON\nAndrew Blake, MD of Microsoft Research\nJack Boyer, a general \u201centrepreneur\u201d\nJulia King, former Rolls Royce executive\nPierre-Louis Viollet, a Vice-President of EDF\nDavid Watson, a director of IBM\nJeremy Watson, a director of Arup\nTony Wood, a head of Pfizer\nJoin Felix.\nAt the very least, you\u2019ll get a place to kip at lunchtime\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

The\nwhole lot of you, in fact, and\nthe way in which you all spread\nyour ideas using social media.\nBasically, over the past couple of years\nsocial media has quickly evolved from\na novel way of keeping in touch into a\nway for people to share their passions,\nproblems and grievances \u2013 and in doing so I\u2019m of the firm belief that it\u2019s\nbecome a useless, vapid place. People\nseem to think they are making a difference when they click the \u2018Like\u2019 button\n\u2013 but they are, unfortunately, kidding\nthemselves.\nYou may remember that earlier this\nyear Felix was accused of sexism \u2013 a\nclaim that was correct, in many ways.\nSocial media was partly responsible for\nthe resulting scandal, but what you must\nreally ask yourself is this: what\u2019s really changed? Hangman got a revamp,\nbut it\u2019ll be back to its old tricks soon\nenough. That\u2019s because the content in\nHangman is basically decided by the\nperson who writes for it. If Hangman is\nsexist or racist or whatever other \u201c-ist\u201d\nyou\u2019d like to pick, it\u2019s probably because\nthe person who wrote it was too. The\nauthor for that article may have got a\nwrap on the knuckles, but who\u2019s to say\nthat the writer who comes along next\nwon\u2019t be just the same? Maybe not this\nyear, especially when the memory is\nstill fresh, but next year or the year after\nwhen everyone\u2019s moved on there\u2019s not\nreally anything that can change to stop\nit happening again. It\u2019s a problem with\nsociety itself that people have these\nsorts of opinions, and it\u2019s going to take\na lot more than a few angry people on\nTwitter to change the opinions of a na-tion.\nThere\u2019s another problem. Given that\n(following from last week\u2019s sexism survey results) it was only a disgruntled\nminority that kicked up a fuss, and the\nmajority of Imperialites don\u2019t really\nfeel affected by sexism, was it even\ncorrect to have paid attention to these\nopinions? At the time, I remember asking various people what they thought,\nSocial media never achieves anything\nand opinion was divided. Some thought\nthat it was indeed trivializing rape, and\nothers thought it was all a big fuss over\nnothing. I\u2019m not going to be so dumb\nas to pass judgment on which camp I\nthink was right, but I think it\u2019s fair to\nsay that what I saw was a lack of con-sensus. Why, then, was this event a big\ndeal \u2013 big enough to make it into a national newspaper?\nI believe that it\u2019s basically because\neveryone is listening to social media\ntoo much. Governments and companies and even individuals seem to take\nTwitter very seriously \u2013 way too seriously given the percentage and particular demographic of the population\nit represents. Whenever someone reads\nsome negative criticism on social media more often than not they seem to\nfreak out a little bit, and normally end\nup making a far overblown response.\nThe problem here is with the social\nmedium itself \u2013 Twitter and Facebook\nare so quick and instant that a couple\nof hours without an official response is\nlike a lifetime. Compare this with good\nold fashioned snail mail: the speed of\nreply gives a lot more time to actually\nthink before blurting something out\ninto the public domain.\nFundamentally, social media is faddy.\nPeople are always looking for what\u2019s\nnew and what\u2019s original, and they want\nyou to give it to them so that they don\u2019t\nhave to find it themselves. The problem with this is that it\u2019s hard to keep\npeople interested for longer then about\nfive minutes \u2013 longer than that and\nthey\u2019ve moved on to the next big thing.\nYou may remember the huge outpouring of emotion about the American bill\nSOPA, which would curtail Internet\nfreedom. Wikipedia, Reddit, and perhaps even Google if I remember cor-rectly, all got behind the \u2018Stop SOPA\u2019\ncampaign by making their webpages\nblack or dark or whatever for just over\na day. With that much exposure the\nmessage was got out to quite a number\nof people, and at the time there was a\nfair amount of public outcry about it \u2013\nso much so that it\u2019s discussion in Congress was postponed until \u2018consensus\u2019\ncould be reached. Do you remember\nhow that story ended? Unless you\u2019re\nwell into your technology news, you\nprobably don\u2019t. It turns out that whilst\nSOPA may not be such an imminent\nthreat, there are still plenty of other tabled bills that are just like SOPA under\na different name, but worse (go look up\nCISPA if you\u2019re interested).\nSo why aren\u2019t we hearing about these\non social media? Because it\u2019s old news!\nInternet freedom is, like, so last month,\nguys. The thing is, social networks have\ngone from being a useful method of\ncommunication to being more like a\ngame. No, game is too strong a word\n\u2013 popularity contest. People post links,\nstatuses and tweets as a way of bulking\nup their own self-esteem and they use\nhow many \u2018likes\u2019 or \u2018retweets\u2019 they get\nas a measure of acceptance amongst\npeers. In many ways this is a perfectly\nnatural thing to do \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\nit\u2019d be controversial to say that seeking\nacceptance is a big part of human nature\n\u2013 but what it means is that all people are\ninterested in is scoring Internet points,\nnot actually making a difference.\nThe common defense is that social\nmedia makes people aware of an issueWe\u2019ve pre-emptively deployed police to Felix Online\u2019s cyberoffices to\ncontrol the surge of comments that this article will inevitably create\nAll people are\ninterested in is\nscoring Internet\npoints, not\nactually making a\ndifference\n\u201d\naking a\naking a\n\u201c\nAll peo\nAll peo\ninteres\ninteres\nthis argument was banded about quite a\nbit when the campaign against Kony hit\nthe stage. But so what? More people are\naware, great. Now they can make even\nmore people aware! Wicked. But then\nall we end up with is a lot of people who\nare very aware. Awareness is only useful if it translates into meaningful ac-tion. Because social media is so casual\nand so quick, people don\u2019t get involved\nand people don\u2019t get active in whatever\ncause they\u2019re promoting this week, they\njust get aware. Which, I might point out,\nis entirely useless. The example which I\nthink is the climax of this was the fad of\nchanging profile pictures to children\u2019s\nTV and film characters in the name of\n\u2018stopping child abuse\u2019. For a while this\nwas a huge thing and a lot of users got\ninvolved with it, but it had next to zero\nactual effect in the real world and the\nfallout from it was minimal.\nSo here\u2019s a tip: next time you a find a\ncause that you care about, and you want\nto tell all your friends on Faceplace\nabout it, don\u2019t. Instead, consider actually doing something about it. Write\nto your MP, donate some money to a\ncharity, you know, things that actually\ngenerate change in places other than\ncyberspace.\nSimon\nWorthington\nCat got your tongue?\nWrote up some notes on Monday, took a past paper on Tuesday, I was\nrevising on Wednesday, and on Thursday and Friday and Saturday and\nthen wrote for Comment to complain about it on Sunday.\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 01 June 2012\n\n"

    "content": "For anyone considering a career in biological or medical research, the old catchphrase\n\u201cNever work with children or animals\u201d often\ncomes into play. Biological data never quite\ndoes what you want it to. Sometimes a scientist\u2019s intuition, or even looking graphs of your\ndata, tells you that the trend you\u2019re looking\nfor does exist. But now the question is, how\ncan one get the statistics to prove it to the rest\nof the scientific world?\nThis dilemma has troubled many a biology student over the course of time. There\nis nothing worse than the feeling of despair,\nafter spending many weeks in the lab, or out\nin the field in the heat, rain or cold, to come\nto analysing your data and to discover that\nthe result is...nothing. But with biological or\nmedical data, this is often invariably the case.\nThere are many reasons for this. Firstly,\nanimals, plants and people are affected by a\nmultitude of complex factors that all interact\nwith each other. Even if you have an idea of\nthe main factors that may be affecting your\nresults, and you measure these, it is impossible to measure every single factor, and account for every single bias. But statistics is\na wide field, and there are some interesting\nstatistical tests out there which can be very\nuseful to biologists.\nQuantile regression is a test that can be\nused when you have unequal variation in your\ndata. Biological data often has unequal varia-tion. This is because if many factors are affecting the variables you are measuring, this\nmeans that there is often more than one rate\nof change between one measured variable\nand another, due to some of the unmeasured\nfactors. Biological data is also often subject\nto limiting factors, where the minimum and\nmaximum responses measured may be under\nquite different constraints. Quantile regression analysis allows you to estimate multiple\nrates of change in your data, and using this\nyou can often find results that other regression methods may have missed out on.\nAnother problem biologists often face is\nthat of outliers that mess up their results. Why\ncouldn\u2019t that one fish/fruit fly/mouse behave\nlike the others? Does it make sense to ignore\nit, or is that bad science?\nRobust regression is a method especially\ndeveloped to deal with influential outliers. If\nDon\u2019t regress into despair\nFELIX\nFriday 01 june 2012\n12\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nOn the second anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a new report\nsuggests that existing scientific models were\ninadequate to deal with the disaster. The team,\nbased at the University of California, Santa Barbara, have published the first comprehensive\nstudy of what happened at the Deepwater oil\nspill in 2010.\nReleasing an estimated 206 million gallons of\noil at unprecedented depths, the spill was the\nlargest accidental marine spill in the history of\nthe petroleum industry.\nChemical dispersants, which are often used in\nshallow-water and surface spills, were applied\nto the spill to clean up and contain the oil.\n\u201cThat model works well for pipeline breaks\nand tanker ruptures,\u201d explains co-author Sean\nAnderson, an associate professor at California\nState University Channel Islands, \u201cbut it is inadequate for this novel type of deep blowout.\u201d\nThe study found that the majority of the oil is\nretained at depth, rapidly emulsified and dispersed by the resulting action of the pressurised\noil jetting from the wellbore.\n\u201cWe have generally hailed the use of (chemi-cal) dispersants as helpful, but really are basing\nthis on the fact we seemed to have kept oil from\ngetting to the surface,\u201d argues co-author Gary\nCherr, director of University of California, Davis\u2019s\nBodega Marine Lab.\n\u201cThe truth is much of this oil probably was\nstaying at depth, independent of the amount of\nsurfactants we dumped into the ocean. And we\ndumped a lot of dispersants into the ocean\u2014all\ntold, approximately one-third of the global supply.\u201d\nWhile the team have identified that the bulk\nof the impact would have been in the mid-water\nand deep ocean, very little is known about the\nmarine ecology at such depths. As a result of\nthese findings, the study calls for further investigation into the long-term effects of deep-water\noil spills.\nFlora Malein\nShedding light on the Deepwater\nHorizon oil spill\nyou\u2019re getting really fancy, you can even statistically prove that something is an outlier,\nby using tests such as the cook\u2019s D statistic.\nRobust regression does not ignore that one\nannoying ant/shrub/patient in your data, but it\ntakes into account the fact that it is an outlier\nand down-weights it accordingly, often helping you to get more useful results.\nSo before your lack of results gets you\ndown and makes you wonder why you didn\u2019t\ngo for that career in the City, remember that it\nsometimes takes just a little bit more patience\nto pull out your breakthrough scientific find-ings.\nMaya Kaushik\nIt\u2019s been nearly sixty years since Marilyn\nMonroe and Jane Russell told of the gentleman\u2019s penchant for blondes, but it has\nrecently come to light that mother nature\nherself may feel the same way: blonde hair\nevolved twice.\nNow, I\u2019m sure you were all aware that the\nprincipal evolution of blonde hair occurred\nin northern Europe about 11,000 years ago\nas a result of a mutation of the hair colour\ngene MC1R, right? Though you may not\nhave known of the prevalence of naturally\nfair hair in Melanesia, a group of islands in\nthe Pacific Ocean, north-east of Australia,\nwhere it is thought that around 10% of the\nnatives display the trait (thus making the\nanswer to the question posed in the title approximately one million). Despite possessing the darkest skin pigmentation of any\nnon-African population, the Melanesians\naccount for the greatest incidence of the\nblonde barnet outside of Europe.\nIt had long been the consensus of opinion\nthat this unusual follicular occurrence was\ndue to the seed-spreading of European colo-nisers, yet research undertaken by Kenny et\nal. (2012) confirms that its evolution is the\nresult of a mutation independent to that of\nthe aforementioned MC1R gene:\nAfter comparing the genomes of blonde\nand dark-haired Melanesians, Kenny and\nhis colleagues ascertained that the presence\nof the former is instead caused by a mutation of the TRYP1 gene, which is in turn\nresponsible for an enzyme that denotes hair\ncolour in various mammals. However, the\ngene in question has no bearing on pigmentation among European populations, meaning that the two varieties of blonde hair\nare completely unrelated in terms of their\ngenetic basis. Further evidence is provided\nby the high likelihood that this particular\nmutation of the TRYP1 gene is exclusive to\nthe Pacific Islands.\nSo how did this unusual physical characteristic reach such abundance throughout\nHow many blondes in Melanesia?\nthe various isolated populations that constitute Melanesia?\nThis is surely the question that Kenny\nwill now be asking himself, especially as\nthe blonde mutation is proven to be reces-sive, meaning that it must be inherited from\nboth parents in order to acquire the golden\nlocks in question.\nPerhaps said hair colour constitutes some\nsort of advantage when it comes to attracting mates, the same way it does in Europe\n(as well as a certain film from the \u201850s).\nOr maybe the mutation does not account\nfor all cases of blonde hair among Melanesians: some such instances may be related\nto the relative age, gender or sun exposure\nof individuals.\nIn what will be considered by many the\ngreatest anticlimax since the rapture of 21st\nMay 2011, I\u2019m going to put forward the\ntheory that the high frequency of blonde\nhair in Melanesia was the result of simple\nchance.\nDOI:10.1126/science.1217849\nRobert Treasure\nThe BP oil rig ablaze\nRegression analysis.

Ken Loach)\nJohn Park\nDirector Rupert Sanders\nScreenwriters Evan Daugherty, John\nLee Hancock, Hossein Amini\nCast Charlize Theron, Kristen\nStewart, Chris Hemsworth, Sam\nClaflin\nSnow White and the\nHuntsman\nWhen it comes to beauty, it is easy to\nwonder just what Charlize Theron has\nto worry about. She asks her magic\nmirror the age-old question; \u201cWho is\nfairest of them all?\u201d The mirror, which\nturns into a magical gooey creature, in\nits infinite wisdom and omniscience,\nanswers that it is Queen Ravenna\n(Theron) who is the most beautiful in\nthe land. Not so surprising and hardly\ndifficult to believe, given how gob-smackingly stunning she looks here.\nShe also puts on a devilishly sexy English accent, which all the more boosts\nher appeal. But hold on, the mirror is\nnot finished. There is someone destined\nto surpass her. And this is none other\nthan her stepdaughter, Snow White\n(Stewart). If you pit one against the\nother, it is obvious that both in terms\nof talent and beauty, Theron thoroughly\noutclasses the helpless young princess.\nSo don\u2019t begrudge yourself for secretly\nsiding with the Queen throughout.\nBut it turns out the Queen is an evil\ntyrant whose insecurity has driven to\ndo insane things. Her country is a war-torn mess of a dump, and in order to\npreserve her beauty, she sucks \u201cyouth\u201d\nout of many innocent young women.\nWhen she hears her eternal beauty will\nbe maintained if she consumes Snow\u2019s\nheart, you know she will stop at nothing to achieve exactly that. So imagine\nher shrieking anger when Snow manages to escape. The guard in charge,\nher brother, deservedly gets a massive\nslap, and in comes the scruffy but angry\nand aggressive huntsman (Hemsworth).\nAnd he is the unexpected hero of this\ntale as he finds it in his heart to help\ninstead of hack the young girl. He goes\ndirectly against the Queen\u2019s explicit or-ders, and decides to join Snow in her\nquest to overthrow and reintroduce the\nrightful heir to the throne, i.e. the young\nprincess herself.\nCausing a slight kink in this potential love-line is William (Claflin), the\nPrince Charming-type character who\nwas a close childhood friend of the\nprincess. When Ravenna murdered her\nnew husband the King and took over his\nkingdom, William managed to escape\nwith his father the Duke, who now tries\nto lead a resistance against the Queen,\nwhereas the young princess couldn\u2019t\nflee. Learning of her survival years\nlater, he vows to find her and never let\nher go. He makes a rash decision to join\nthe enemy\u2019s Snow White search party\nin the hopes of finding his first and possibly only love of his life.\nAlready, there are plenty of characters to develop and juggle. And for the\nmost part, all the leads are given proper\nattention to, with actors more than\nmerely looking the part. Oscar-winning\nTheron steals the show whenever her\ndeliciously over-the-top, mentally unstable and dangerous Queen appears.\nShe represents anything and everything related to death and decay, and\nher darkly majestic presence is truly a\nmajor casting highlight, which would\nexplain why Theron has taken centre\nstage in much of the film\u2019s advertising.\nThe film also provides a brief glimpse\ninto her past and the abuse she witnessed as a child, which partly explains\nher constant wrath and fiery impulses.\nAlthough this undermines the evil stature of her character, the vulnerability\nTheron brings out in someone who was\nnever expected to arouse an ounce of\nsympathy is an impressive feat, and introduces an interesting angle on a fascinating villain.\nHer only realistic nemesis and one\nwho can put an end to the wicked\nQueen\u2019s curse is Stewart. What she\nmay lack superficially in looks, she\nmakes up for by carrying innocence\nand general goodness. It is told early\non that Snow possesses rare beauty\u2026in\nher heart, and that this will eventually\nvanquish evil. It sounds all too cheesy\nand childish, and the grown-up Stewart doesn\u2019t exactly look like the poster\nchild of untainted purity, but it\u2019s her\nblossoming confidence and representation of \u201clife\u201d she carries that translates\nwell on the screen. The nervous, twitching looks Stewart cannot shake off in\nany film she stars in do serve her well\nhere, as with these she can convincingly look weak and worried.\nOf the two men, coming out on top\nis Hemsworth, who trades in his usual\nweapon of choice, a Norse hammer, for\nsome axes, assisting the princess with\nhis macho charisma. He does also get\na crucial scene of sentimentality that\nthe actor handles with touching poise.\nSharing a little less screen time is Claflin, last seen in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides as the priest who\nlost more and more clothing as the film\nprogressed. Here he\u2019s given as little to\nwork with as he did in Rob Marshall\u2019s\nmediocre Pirates entry, and the single\nmemorable aspect about his character\nis his considerable archery skills. Other\nthan that he has a small role to play in\nthe end, and his interaction with his\nchildhood sweetheart goes disappointingly unaddressed.\nStaying loyal to the tale of Snow\nWhite, the audience gets the meet the\ndwarves as well as the infamous poisoned apple. The dwarves are the most\nunderdeveloped group of the lot, and\nwe just have to settle for watching them\nas mild comic relief. But given the predominantly British talent involved (Ray\nWinstone, Toby Jones, Nick Frost, Eddie Marsan etc), it must be said there\nwas a lot more potential to make something more out of these guys than to use\nthem for a few comic scenes involving\nthe sewer.\nFocusing back and forth between the\nQueen\u2019s castle where she is plotting her\nnext move against her stepdaughter and\nSnow White\u2019s justice journey, first-time\ndirector Sanders finds a simple yet effective way of weaving all the strands\ntogether. He throws in a whole load\nof extended shots of beautiful scenery\ncapturing all sorts of landscapes and\ndifferent weathers. It\u2019s nothing inventive or particularly original, but they\nserve their purpose, offering smooth\ntransitions between scenes.\nThe action remains small-scale\nthroughout, and despite the disappointing final showdown with the Queen, the\nrest of the pulse-racing action is filmed\nwith focus and energy. Whenever you\nfeel the narrative is slowing down\nslightly, Sanders brings back the healthy\npace with bursts of energy stemming\nfrom the well-choreographed, compact\naction. It is long overall, with scenes\nthat could have worked just as well, if\nnot better in a shorter time period, but\nalong with all the cute furry animals\nalso making an appearance, this two-hour long spectacle is well worth sitting through, if not only for Theron\u2019s\nmagnificently ferocious turn.\nTheron a roll! Sorry, that caption attempt was a bit Grimm...\n\u201cFor the most part,\nthe leads are given\nproper attention\u201d\n\u201cThis two-hour long\nspectacle is worth\nsitting through\u201d\nFILM\nFELIX Friday 01 JUNE 2012 25\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\n\n"

    "content": "In Brief\nCentral Library for 24 hour\nopening over Summer\nFor the first time in Imperial College history, the\nCentral Library will continue its 24-hour opening\ntimes throughout the summer holidays. Imperial\nCollege has decided to keep its library door open\nto students who wish to use the library, starting\nfrom 30 June through until 30 September.\nIn previous years, the 24-hour opening policy\nwould usually cease by the end of June. The new\nopening hours this year means that students will\nbe able to use the library as they please, with the\nlibrary only closing at 11pm on a Friday night until 10am on Saturday morning. The Library Caf\u00e9\nwill also remain open in accordance to the summer opening hours but will be closed on Sundays\nthroughout the holidays.\nThe main body of students intended to make\nuse of the extended opening hours will be postgraduates who will be on campus over the holi-days. Other targets include Master students,\nMBA students from the Business School and anyone who would potentially want to use the library\nover the summer.\nPostgraduate student Sajjad Jaffer was wary\nof the new hours, telling Felix of his belief that\n\u201cthere aren\u2019t many moments when you have to\ngo to the library that late at night as a postgraduate\u201d. He also added that \u201ceverything is online\nanyway like journals and books. You can use the\nVPN network to connect your home computer to\nthe Imperial Network so you don\u2019t need to go to\nthe Library to get anything done\u201d.\nDirector of Library Services, Deborah Shorley,\ntold Felix instead of the benefits that she believes the scheme will bring, saying that library\nstaff were \u201cparticularly conscious because of\nthe Olympics and the disruption it would cause\nacross town.\n\u201cStudents such as postgraduates will find it\nhard to find a quiet place to work and so we are\ngoing to offer them a haven to work in regardless\nof the chaos that is happening outside.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cwhat students want is a place\nto sit, a place to work and a place with a computer space. They don\u2019t want complicated reference\nsupport all the time. We believe it will be cost effective and since this is a pilot we cannot be sure\nif it is really used or not until we try it \u2013 if it isn\u2019t\nthen we won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\nShe also said that some postgraduates do not\nuse their offices to work: \u201cwe\u2019ve learnt that students want to work in different ways and our aim\nis to give students as many different ways as we\ncan by offering options such as different spaces\nin the library and quicker access to resources.\u201d\nShe concluded: \u201cWhen presented to the Student\u2019s Union, the response was overwhelmingly\npositive. The Union has nominated us for the\n\u201cOutstanding Library Team\u201d award for the Times\nHigher Education Leadership and Management\nAwards and we are very proud of this and how\nmuch they appreciate our library hours.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to be nominated by the students.\nThat is very important to us because we only exist as a service; we think this is another step to\ngiving students more of what they want.\u201d\nAemun Reza\nNEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 01 June 2012\n4\nAs excitement mounts for this year\u2019s sporting\nsummer, and as career opportunities become\never more uncertain given the unsteady financial climate, a group of Imperial graduates\nhave been given the best of both worlds, with\nthe chance to work at the London 2012 Olympics this summer as part of a one off graduate\nprogramme introduced by BP.\nClaire Madden, due to graduate in chemical\nengineering this year, is one of six Imperial\ngraduates who will be taking advantage of the\nprogramme.\nBP\u2019s incoming graduate recruits have been\ngiven the chance, following an interview pro-cess, to work with the London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) before starting their\ncareers in September. During short-term sec-ondments, the recruits will take responsibilities\nin areas such as transport and main operations.\nClaire admitted to Felix that the Olympics\nhad seemed an attractive prospect before she\nwas aware of the programme: \u201cI wanted to go\nto the Olympics anyway, either to try and get\ntickets or try to get involved, so the fact that\nthis opportunity became available is something\nthat I was very keen to get involved with\u201d.\nBased in the transport sector at the media\nhub in Bloomsbury, Claire will be tasked with\nensuring the media are sent exactly where they\nneed to go. Claire also holds the position of\nteam leader, and will ensure that everyone on\nher team knows what needs to be done for the\nday, making sure everyone is happy.\nClaire explained how the new programme\nwas set apart from \u2018normal\u2019 progression into a\ngraduate scheme: \u201cAt university when you\u2019re,\nfor example, working in teams and doing\nprojects you do develop certain skills but you\nnever get placed in such a fast paced situation\nwhere you have to act immediately to make\nsure things work. There\u2019s a lot riding on the\nsuccess of the London 2012 Olympics but it\u2019s\ngood to know that we\u2019re being trusted with\ncertain responsibilities that many of our peers\nwould not get in their first role.\u201d\nAs to whether she was excited to be leading\nthe way as much as this programme allows,\nClaire said that \u201ca lot of the graduates who had\njust started in the last couple of years wished\nthat they could have been on the programme\nas well.\u201d\nThe graduates are currently being trained by\nBP before they start their roles in the summer,\nand will undertake further training by the London 2012 Organising Committee.\n\u201cHaving this experience behind us will give\nus the confidence to know that we can manage\npeople and we\u2019ve been given the chance to do\nthat on a massive scale.\u201d\n\u201cthe recruits will take responsibilities in a variety\nof areas\u201d\n\u201cthis experience ... will\ngive us the confidence to\nknow that we can manage people\u201d\nMatthew Colvin\nImperial graduates jump at\nchance to help at London 2012\nNew BP graduate scheme gives students an Olympic chance\nBP graduates at the Olympic Stadium, including Claire Madden, but not including Kelly Holmes\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX Friday 01 june 2012 13\nSugar and the brain\nS\ncientists have warned students preparing for exams\nthat eating sugary desserts\nmakes you stupid.\nScientists have known\nfor a long time that sugar makes you\nfat. But now a group of neuroscientists in California believe that a sugary\ndiet also slackens the brain, harms the\nmind\u2019s ability to absorb knowledge\nand disturbs memory.\nThe scientists believe that eating fish\nand flaxseed oils can minimise this\ndamage, which is caused by a high\nfructose diet.\nFructose is a simple sugar naturally\nfound in fruit. However, the type of\nfructose found in fruit is not harmful\nbecause of the high level of antioxidants also found in fruit.\nBy contrast, the fructose found in\npreservatives and sweeteners like High\nFructose Corn Syrup is often injected\ninto food and drink with no nutrients\nor antioxidants, such as fizzy drinks,\ncondiments and other processed foods.\nMany blame the introduction of\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup onto the\nfood market on President Richard Nixon, whose war on poverty led him to\nseek cheaper, sweeter and more easily\ntransportable sugar than normal table\nsugar.\nAlthough a high fructose diet is well-known for its harmful effects on the\nbody, leading to diabetes and obesity,\nthe Californian study is one of the first\nto suggest that it may also harm learning and brain function.\nFour groups of rodents were fed a\nstandard rat feed for one week prior to\nthe experiment, which was conducted\nat the University of California and\npublished in The Journal of Physiology in May.\nThe rodents were also trained to\nnavigate a complex maze that only had\none exit. The rats were able to locate\nand remember the exit using a series\nof visual cues or signposts scattered\nthroughout the labyrinth.\nAn ordinary rat will learn to locate\nthe exit, travelling directly there, after\nfour or five attempts.\nAfter this initial training phase, the\nresearchers continued to feed one\ngroup of rodents the normal rat feed.\nAnother group received the rat feed\nbut also received fish and flaxseed oils,\nwhich are a source of omega-3-fatty\nacids.\nThe final two groups of rodents were\ngiven a high fructose diet. One of\nthese groups received additional ome-ga-3-fatty acids along with their new\nfructose-enhanced feed.\nSix weeks later, all four groups were\nreturned to the maze. The rats that\nwere fed a high fructose diet fared the\nworst, taking the longest to find their\nway out of the maze. By contrast, those\nwho ate the normal rat feed that had\nbeen supplemented with omega-3-fat-ty acids navigated the maze faster than\nany other group.\nAfter the challenge, the scientists\nFructose, a sweetener used widely in processed food and drink, can also be found in fruits and High Fructose Corn Syrup. Antioxidants in fruits prevent their fructose from being harmful\ntopnews.in\ndissected the rats\u2019 brains to look at\nthe effects of the different diets on the\nbrain cells.\nThey found that the brains of the\nrats that were fed a high fructose diet\ndisplayed signs of insulin resistance, a\nwell-known culprit of obesity and dia-betes. Again, this resistance was greatest in rats that didn\u2019t receive the fish\nand flaxseed oils.\nThe neuroscientists who worked on\nthe Californian rat study advise students gearing up for exams to skimp on\ndessert to improve their brain\u2019s ability\nZara Shubber looks at scientists\u2019 warnings that high fructose diets may be detrimental to memory\nD-Fructose (above). High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a mixture of glucose and fructose as monosaccharides\nto absorb knowledge.\nBut, if the temptation to eat sugar\nproves too powerful, they also recommend eating more omega-3 in order to\nboost the brain\u2019s function.\nGomez-Pinilla, the lead researcher,\nrecommends taking a gram per day of\nomega-3 by eating fish, flaxseed oil or\nfish oil supplements.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saving money in the bank.\nYou want to build a reserve for your\nbrain to tap when it requires extra fuel\nto fight off future diseases,\u201d he said.\n\n"

Many mourned\nher sudden and tragic death, but her legacy and influences are still felt\neven to this day. In her short but undeniably remarkable career, Monroe\nachieved a wide range of repetoire and is often hailed as one of the top stars and\nactresses of the Hollywood Golden Age. In honour of the actress\u2019 birthday, as well\nas the 50th anniversary of her mysterious death, Felix Film looks over the highlights of a distinguished career of a truly unique and great all-round entertainer.\n1. Career Beginnings: The Asphalt Jungle (1950), All About Eve (1950)\nAfter an initial period of struggle that included a couple of successful screen-tests, modellings, small parts,\na poorly reviewed film and an eventual termination of contract from Columbia, Monroe found her breakthrough in The Asphalt Jungle, an MGM-financed drama in which she played a girlfriend of an old criminal.\nHer performance caught the eye of Joseph Mankiewicz, a highly influential, talented director, producer and\nwriter who hired Monroe for a small comedic role in his Oscar-winning masterpiece All About Eve as a slightly\ndim-witted aspiring actress. Monroe\u2019s profound acting influence and aspiration came from the works of Lana\nTurner and Jean Harlow whose films she extensively researched and studied.\n2. Sex Symbol: Niagara (1953)\nFollowing her initial success she signed a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. After a few moderately\nsuccessful films and a potential sex scandal during which a nude photo from her past was circulated, she\nstarted receiving substantial supporting roles starring against huge names such as Barbara Stanwyck, Cary\nGrant and Ginger Rogers. The most eye-catching, talked-about role in this period however, was her performance in Niagara, in which she played a seductive femme-fatale plotting to murder her husband. Monroe\u2019s\novertly sexual portrayal of her character attracted some criticism and outrage from the conservative audience at the time, although the press and interest surrounding the platinum-blonde, effortlessly sexy actress\nkept the spotlight on her.\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 01 june 2012 19\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nI\nlike the Green Party. I voted for\nthem in May, on all three bal-lots, and I would vote for them\nagain if there were a General\nElection tomorrow. But, as with\nmost friends, they often disappoint me.\nWhile I was severely depressed by their\npledge to offer homeopathic \u201cmedicine\u201d on the NHS, and their plans to\nimplement a health service for pets, the\nrecent news about their opposition to\ngenetically modified crops has been the\nmost disappointing thing of all.\nOn Sunday, Jenny Jones, the Green\nMayoral candidate, appeared at Take\nthe Flour Back, a protest against experiments with genetically modified wheat.\nI say \u201cprotest\u201d, but really it was vandal-ism. The \u201cprotesters\u201d attempted (and\nfailed) to \u201cdecontaminate\u201d the countryside by destroying the scientists\u2019 plants.\nAnd the Green Party, fools that they are,\nmentioned the event on their website.\nI\u2019m all in favour of vandalism as a\nform of protest, but the protest must be\nlegitimate \u2013 and destroying scientists\u2019\nwork is about as illegitimate as it gets.\nIt reeks of the Catholic Church against\nGalileo, or Evangelical Christians\u2019 hatred of Evolution. The Take the Flour\nBack logo is a loaf of bread with the\nhead and legs of a cow. The whole affair is scare-mongering with no basis in\nfact, and a depressing sight for anyone\nwho previously thought of Jenny Jones\nas the most science-friendly London\ncandidate.\nBut official Green Party policy on\nthe matter is entirely in favour of the\nexperiment. \u201cWhile the Green party\nis more sceptical about the way GM\ncrops and gene patenting has been applied by multinational corporations like\nMonsanto, we are not opposed to GM\nresearch itself,\u201d according to Green\nParty press officer Scott Redding. So\nthat\u2019s nice.\nJenny Jones, on the other hand, is a\nfool. Genetic modification of crops is,\nalong with the worldwide emancipation\nGreens and GM: a scientist\u2019s dilemma\nof women, the only solution to famine\nand constant poverty in the developing\nworld. Opposing it amounts to a kind of\npre-emptive murder, a bourgeois luxury\nthat only those with no chance of starvation could endorse.\nThat said, the protesters do have\nsomething that vaguely resembles a\npoint. The research is publicly funded,\nbut the resulting strain will be sold to\nan agro-chemicals company, and few\nthings are worse for social justice than\nlarge, powerful companies. There are,\nafter all, no profits in helping penniless\nEast Africans.\nIt follows that protesting against\ngrowing the crops is ridiculous, and\ninstead the group should campaign to\nprevent the sale of the crop to a corpo-ration. Of course, this is a very difficult\nthing to protest against, but such is life;\ndestroying research is a cardinal sin,\nand for scientists like myself (the Green\nParty\u2019s natural voter base) it is a huge\nturn-off.\nI have even heard a large number of\nscientists and students claim that they\nwill never vote Green again, which,\nthough understandable, is actually quite\na curious position. I suspect that had\nKen Livingstone attended the event,\nwe wouldn\u2019t hear the same people\nthoroughly denounce the entire Labour\nparty.\nSome scientists and students said they\nwould vote Liberal Democrat. That is\nremarkable, because (as I explain in\nthis week\u2019s Feature) no UK Government has ever done more to diminish\nacademic independence than the current one. Compared with the increase of\ntuition fees, the privatisation of parts of\nthe NHS, and the aggressively pro-busi-ness position of the Research Councils\nsince the 2010 review, the Green Party\u2019s\nopposition to GM seems minuscule.\nOthers said they would vote Labour.\nThat is also remarkable, because no UK\nGovernment has done more to promote\nprivatisation in science and academia\nthan that of Tony Blair, the same man\nwho surged ahead with the Private Finance Initiative and introduced tuition\nfees in the first place. Also remember\nthat, when asked, all Labour MPs refuse\nto answer the question of whether they\nwill reduce tuition fees once in office.\nSo they won\u2019t.\nSmall, left-wing parties are held to\nimpossibly high standards: one mistake\nand people will dismiss them instantly.\nOne student told me he\u2019d never vote for\nthe Respect Party because George Galloway was an apologist for totalitarian-ism, but he was happy to vote for Labour\nor the Liberal Democrats. I pointed out\nthat Labour\u2019s David Miliband had engaged in business deals with Gaddaffi\nin full knowledge of his use of torture\nand suppression of democracy. I told\nhim that the Lib Dem Vince Cable had\nspent years working for Shell, a company with a dreadful record of human\nrights abuses in Nigeria.\nBy this point he had stopped listen-ing, but I like to think I won the argu-ment. If, as all these students and scientists suggest, we can dismiss a whole\nparty on the behaviour of just one of its\nmembers, then is there any party worth\nvoting for?\nThe fact is, with all three main parties\nfirmly in the right-authoritarian quarter\nof the political compass, the Greens offer the only genuine option for bringing any kind of socialism to Britain,\nshort of a revolution. For a left-wing\nperson to vote Lib Dem or Labour at\nthis point in history (to use a horrible\nclich\u00e9) amounts to cutting off your nose\nto spite your face. Until people stop dismissing the Greens off-hand because of\nsingle-issue qualms, I can see no way\nout of this neoliberal mess. Yes, they\u2019re\nnot perfect, but of four evils the Green\nParty is the least by a long, long way.\nYes, they\u2019re not\nperfect, but of\nfour evils the\nGreen Party is\nthe least by a\nlong, long way\n\u201c\nYes, th\nYes, th\nperfect\nperfect\n\u201d\ny a\ny a\nway\nway\nStephen Smith\nDon\u2019t blame the genetic modification for Brain\u2019s insanity\nEXAMS. Just in case you had forgotten\nY\nou know when Facebook\nhas that dumb \u201cwhat\u2019s\non your mind\u201d thing\non the status box, well\nthere\u2019s been one thing on\nmy mind all term. Exams. Trouble is,\nonce you get old (I\u2019m a 4th Year\u2026) you\njust stop being phased by the whole not-being-able-to-answer-entire-sections-of-exams thing. Maybe I\u2019ve become au\nfait with how exams at university work,\nor maybe all us final years are just burnt\nout and don\u2019t care anymore, oddly at\nthe most crucial stage of our degree. To\nbe honest with you, final years have had\nso many exams for so long that we\u2019re\njust bored of them now.\nI like to think it\u2019s the former. I honestly feel sorry for this year\u2019s freshers,\nand next year\u2019s lot too. They needed a\ncouple of A*s, not As. Even if you do\nsay \u2018meh, exams were harder in my\nday\u2019 you still have to appreciate the error margin they have. 10% is not much\nto work with: one mistake and you\u2019re\nlike a screw on a construction site \u2013 totally screwed (I have exams alright, I\ncouldn\u2019t be bothered to think of a better simile). Kids nowadays (uhoh, I am\nold) are so used to needing 90% on an\nexam that the adjustment to suddenly\nnot being able to know absolutely everything perfectly and never be phased\nin an exam is just incredibly extreme.\nSuddenly entire parts seem like they\ncan\u2019t possibly have been on the sylla-bus.\nSo here comes the advice paragraph.\nRelax, a bit. Half of the battle is staying\ncalm under the pressure. If you let the\nvolume of content and short amount of\ntime get to you, you\u2019ll spend 2 hours in\na panic trying to look over 20 things;\nyou could have spent that time properly looking over 10 different bits and\nit would have made a real difference\nto what you know, and makes you feel\nconfident you\u2019re making \u2013 admittedly\nslow \u2013 progress. Essentially, what I\u2019m\nsaying is look that exam right in the eye\nand say the following: fuck you, I\u2019m a\ntotal badass. Quick note though, don\u2019t\nsay that if the exam is a viva; trust me,\nthey won\u2019t appreciate it. Anyway, I\u2019m\noff to revise, calmly. Good luck with\nexams and projects everyone!\nTim Arbabzadah\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE\nFELIX\nFriday 01 JUNE 2012\n8\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nPrivatisation: the Ministry in\nIn the first of a series of articles on the privatisation of our Universities, Stephen Smith discus\nin mathematics (the means by which\npostdoctoral researchers obtain funding\nfor their projects) are available only to\nstatisticians.\nThat is to say, all of pure and applied\nmathematics will be excluded. Current\nand future PhD students in Algebra,\nAnalysis, Geometry, Mathematical\nPhysics, Logic, and all of non-statisti-cal mathematics will have to find other\nways to fund their research.\n\u201cThis will force many of the UK\u2019s\nbest PhD students to leave the country to get their first academic job, and\nwill prevent us from attracting the best\nforeign postdoctoral researchers,\u201d according to Cambridge mathematician\nBurt Totaro, \u201cIf EPSRC continues this\npolicy, British mathematics will face\nmediocrity in a decade.\u201d\nThis is not a question of austerity\nand cuts. As I noted above, the EPSRC\nbudget has fallen only 3.7% since 2007,\nbut mathematics research grant funding\nfell by 54% over the same period. It is\nan attitude problem brought on by the\nperception that pure and applied mathematics don\u2019t have sufficient economic\n\u201cimpact\u201d. In other words, businesses\naren\u2019t interested.\nAnd it\u2019s true, businesses aren\u2019t interested in mathematics, because the research tends to be quite far ahead of its\ntime: a theory developed now may not\nbe used in physics or engineering for\nanother 10 years. Businesses, however,\nare by nature only interested in short-term gains: try to convince your shareholders that their falling share prices\nwill pick up again in a decade and they\nwill laugh in your face. And then sack\nyou. It should come as no surprise that\nfew companies want to invest in math-ematics.\nAnd here is the problem: the EPSRC\nequates the value of a subject with business interest in it. Governments love\nthis, of course, because the economy\nwill boom while they\u2019re in office, and\ncrash after they\u2019ve gone. But for the\nUK it is self-evidently disastrous. So\nhow did this \u201cbusiness-impact\u201d position come about, and what can we do\nabout it?\nA brief history of funding\nThe famous Haldane principle states\nthat decisions over how to allocate research funding should be decided by a\ncouncil of researchers. This supposedly\nkeeps academia free from government\ninfluence, or any outside interference.\nThe principle has generally been in use\nsince 1918, but a few decades ago Margaret Thatcher decided to shake things\nO\nur universities are being\nprivatised, or so many\non the Left would have\nus believe. But how true\nis it? And is it necessarily a bad thing? In a series of features\nover the next few weeks, I will be investigating several areas of privatisation at\nImperial and at universities across the\nUK, areas where corporations are filling\na role that used to be public.\nI\u2019ll look at the Careers Services at\nour Universities, to try to find out why\nmany students are dissatisfied with the\nvariety they offer. I\u2019ll discuss Corporate\nPartnership schemes, to see whether\nacademic-industry collaboration really\ncan be a good thing.\nBut this week I\u2019ll look at every academic\u2019s nightmare: the Research Councils.\nA case study: the EPSRC\nFar to the west of here, in beautiful\nSwindon, you will find the head offices\nof the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). They\nare the organisation which decides how\nto distribute the government\u2019s \u00a3740\nmillion Engineering and Physical Sciences budget.\nThe EPSRC is remarkable mainly for\nits inability to use words: it conveys no\nmeaning whatsoever in whole pages of\ntext. The three \u201chigh priorities\u201d, for in-stance, are \u201cDelivering Impact. Shaping\nCapability. Developing Leaders.\u201d Like\nall partisan political writing, the language here is intended to deceive. \u201cDelivering Impact\u201d in fact means \u201cFunding only those areas which businesses\nwant us to\u201d. \u201cDeveloping Leaders\u201d is\na euphemism for \u201cFunding only those\nresearchers whom we have funded in\nthe past\u201d. I confess, after weeks of re-search, to have no idea what is meant by\n\u201cShaping Capability\u201d.\nBut in spite of (or, perhaps, because\nof) its management-speak, the EPSRC\nhas done a good job of convincing the\nGovernment to give it money. Indeed,\nits budget has fallen only 3.7% in real\nterms since 2007/2008, compared with\ntotal research council cuts of 25.2%.\nRegrettably, having money is only half\nthe battle, and the EPSRC\u2019s new funding plan threatens to stall entire areas of\nresearch.\nMathematics, for instance. The Queen\nof the Sciences, according to mathematicians (the slave of the sciences according to everyone else), is currently\na victim of the new \u201cDelivery Plan\u201d.\nSince July 2011, EPSRC fellowships\nup a bit.\nIn the 1980s, Research Councils came\nunder the influence of a government\npolicy to \u201cstrengthen the links\u201d between science and business. In his book\nCaptive State, George Monbiot explains that, \u201cBritain [...] was renowned\nfor generating scientific breakthroughs,\nbut these seldom translated into economic success, as our discoveries were\ncommercialised elsewhere.\u201d Thatcher\u2019s\nGovernment thought this a wasted op-portunity, and so decided to let businesses influence research.\nIn practice, this policy change resulted in \u201cbusiness leaders\u201d being promoted to Research Councils to \u201censure that\nthe needs of firms are fully taken into\naccount in decisions on the direction,\nnature and content of publicly funded\nscience and technology.\u201d\nIn effect, large businesses would suggest an area of research that would benefit them, and the Research Councils\nwould fund it. As is now glaringly ob-vious, this policy simply led to companies getting the Government to pay for\nresearch which they would otherwise\nhave paid for themselves.\nThis was the first significant undermining of the Haldane principle, the\nsecond came with the arrival of our current government.\nIn December 2010, the Department\nfor Business, Innovation and Skills (it\u2019s\ntelling, isn\u2019t it, that business and science funding are dealt with by the same\nGovernment department) published\na document called the \u201cAllocation of\nScience and Research Funding\u201d which\nsubtly reworded the Haldane Principle.\n\u201cThe Haldane Principle means that\ndecisions on individual research proposals are best taken by researchers\nthemselves,\u201d but Governments can set\n\u201ckey national strategic priorities,\u201d and\n\u201cask Research Councils to consider\nhow best they can contribute to these\npriorities.\u201d\nIn other words, Governments cannot choose which individual proposals\nto fund, but they can ask the Councils\nnot to fund anything in Pure or Applied\nMathematics.\nLooking at the EPSRC in particular,\nthe document states: \u201cDuring 2011-15\nEPSRC will deliver increased impact\nby engaging more strongly with business,\u201d and it will \u201cact to improve further\nthe quality of PhDs it funds [...] so that\nthe skills base generated is most valuable to industry. \u201d It\u2019s worth reading\nthat again: \u201c[...] so that the skills base\ngenerated is most valuable to industry.\u201d\nThe document\u2019s section on the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences\nResearch Council (BBSRC) is even\nmore imposing on academic freedom:\n\u201cBBSRC will prioritise actions to aid\neconomic recovery, drive growth, and\ninfluence public policy,\u201d \u201cBBSRC will\nfocus on extracting economic benefit,\u201d\n\u201cBBSRC will provide [...] high-quality\nPhD training to boost business critical\nR&D.\u201d\nBack at the EPSRC, a very sinister\nvideo for the 2011/2012 Delivery Plan\nstates, \u201cWhile our Strategic Plan set\nout how we will accelerate the pace\nof change, our Delivery Plan sets out\na transformative agenda.\u201d So far, so\nremarkably uninformative. But listen\nbetween the insufferable jargon and the\nreal agenda becomes apparent.\nThe Delivery Plan is \u201cbuilt around a\nSponsor model of Research Management in which funding is viewed as a\nstrategic investment and not as a transfer of funds without obligation.\u201d The\nEPSRC must remain \u201ccommitted to\ngenerating the fundamental knowledge\nand the skilled people essential to Business, Government and other research\norganisations.\u201d \u201cA world class research\nbase is valuable only insofar as it generates economic and social value.\u201d \u201cAnything that is excellent will have impact\nif the pathways are right\u201d.\nYes, \u201canything that is excellent will\nDavid Delpy, CEO of the EPSRC and Gordon Brown. One of these men has been accused of of \u201ccentral planning and micro management,\u201d and \u201csquandering British taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d Can you guess which? (Clue: not\nGordon)\n\n"

By then the Ento team\npredict that the taboo would have\nbeen softened to the point snacking\non fried woodlice at the cinema would\nbe seen as normal and not freakish.\nSo are we likely to see insect delis or\nfast food beetle burgers anytime soon?\nProbably not as soon as Ento predicts.\nWestern bug-eating taboo is likely to\nprevail a little longer, though it will inevitably crumble under combined pressure from Ento-like schemes and rising\nfood demand. Who knows? Maybe\nin five years time future Felix readers will be reading about how best to\ngrill tarantula meat or stew scorpions.\nSuch huge shifts in Western gastronomy will by no means come eas-ily.

It\u2019s just unacceptable! If\nyou feel that life at Imperial has become monotonic (and at the moment\nyour mind thinks of functions) then\nyou need a getaway. Today we\u2019ll present you with an alternative choice.\nUmami is ideally located in the\nmiddle of Cromwell Road and serves\na combination of Thai, Malaysian,\nVietnamese and Singaporean food. It\nhas opened very recently (in March\n2012) so if you didn\u2019t have the chance\nto visit it yet, you should do so soon.\nThe award-winning chef Darren Kutty,\nformerly Head Chef at both the Ramada\nHyde Park and The Washington Hotel\nin Mayfair, promises to treat you well.\nThe menu includes meals in two\nsizes, to taste or to share, and an adequate variety of food to choose from;\na selection of salads, soups, noodles\nand curries together with grilled and\npan or wok-fried dishes like Ped\nMakham (pan seared duck with tamarind and mange tout) and Ikan Bakar\n(grilled red snapper in banana leaf\nserved with sweet tamarind and chilli).\nAs Food Editors, and computing\nstudents whose exams have already\nfinished (hang in there, everybody!)\nwe had the chance to pay a visit at\nUmami for lunch last week. We began\nour course with homemade vegetable\nspring rolls, leaf-marinated chicken,\nking prawns on scallops and a duck\nsalad with lettuce and green mango.\nFor the main, we had green curry\nGrasshopper steak, anyone? If that\ndoesn\u2019t tickle your fancy, how about\nan ant lollipop? Though these ideas\nmay sound revolting, entomophagy,\nthe consumption of insects, may well\nbecome more popular in the Western world as fish stocks dwindle and\nrising population reduces the space\navailable for traditional meat farming.\nInsect cuisine is already popular in many parts of the world, including South America, Oceania,\nmost of Africa and parts of Asia.\nBut why should we adopt their cui-sine? What\u2019s wrong with traditional\nmeat and fish-based dishes, already\nstable, plentiful sources of protein?\nThe problem is that neither meat nor\nfish will be able to support a growing planet. By most estimates, world\npopulation will increase to nine billion\nby 2050, putting an already stressed\nEarth under more pressure to provide\n\u2013 at the current time livestock occupies nearly two-thirds of all farmland.\nUnless intensive farming is extensively practiced (an abhorrent idea), the\namount of land available for rearing\nlivestock will have to be scaled back.\nAnd as for fish? The situation isn\u2019t\nmuch better, with rampant overfishing\nhaving caused numerous fish populations to crash. Even if strict catch quotas\nare enacted and actually abided by it will\ntake years for stocks to recover to their\nformer levels, during which time the\nworld will scream out for meat. Worse\nstill, if we want fish stocks to stay stable\nthere\u2019s no way we can fish as brutally\nefficiently as we have done in the past.\nThe oceans will not be our saviours.\nCue insects. They are a far better\nmeat source, both environmentally and\nnutritionally, than any animal regularly\neaten in the Western world. Simple\nfacts speak volumes \u2013 compared to\ncattle, insects can produce nine times\nmore protein for the same amount of\nfeed, are quite happy eating the stuff\nwe don\u2019t want to, are rich in vitamins\nand minerals, and can be cultivated at\na much higher density when compared\nto conventional livestock. Unfortunately the matter isn\u2019t nearly so simple;\nif someone shoved a plate of fried pill\nbugs under your nose and told you that\nthey\u2019re \u201chigh in protein,\u201d would you eat\nit? Western taboo is the major barrier\npreventing insects from featuring prominently in restaurants and supermarkets.\nPed Makham: mange tout!\nchicken with peas, aubergine and baby\ncorn, and soy-sauce sea bass. It could\nhave just been this particular selection of dishes we made, but every taste\nwas excitingly combined to form a\ndelicious meal. For trivia-lovers, according to the Japanese, umami is one\nof the five basic tastes and we would\nlike to think that we mastered it last\nweek! All dishes were fresh and very\ntasty. The portions are just right, giving visitors the chance to try many different combinations.\nRealising that not everyone has the\ntime \u2013 or the money \u2013 to indulge in a\nlong, leisurely lunch, Umami has introduced an Express Lunch Menu; a\nthree-course feast which is priced at\nan incredible \u00a39.95 per person. Starters comprise a choice of tom yam soup,\nchicken toast or Thai beef salad, followed by a trio of equally tempting\nmain courses: Malay chicken curry\nwith potatoes served with steamed\nrice, Indonesian coconut and tamarind\nfish stew with steamed rice, or wok-fried tofu and seasonal vegetables with\nbasil leaf served with rice or noodles.\nUmami 100 Cromwell Road, SW7\n4ER. Open for lunch Monday to Friday from 12pm to 3pm and for dinner Monday to Sunday from 5pm\nto 10:30pm. For reservations, call\n02073412320.\nCromwell Road\u2019s Umami offers a unique and peaceful atmosphere\nHas the time come to adopt insect cuisine?\nEeeewww... I hate radish! Insect cuisine ala gourmet!\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nMichael Krestas\nLaurence Pope\nonechickennugget.com cargocollective.com/ento\n\u201cNeither meat nor fish\nwill be able to support\na growing planet\u201d\n\n"
