Double EXHIBITIONS\n1. Science in South Kensington\nOn a recent visit to the Lyon Playfair\nLibrary you may have noticed the exhibition \"Science in South Kensington\"\nwhich is running on Level 1. The exhibition commemorates the first association of Imperial College with South\nKensington, when three departments of\nthe Royal School of Mines moved into\nthe newly built Science schools in Exhibition Road during the autumn term,\n1872. Eventually the building housed all\nthe departments of the School of Mines\nand the Royal College of Science. When\nImperial College was founded in 1907\nthe Governors were granted the continued use of the building which became called the \"Huxley Building\" in\n1932 in recognition of T.H. Huxley's outstanding services to the constituent\ncolleges: a memorial plaque was affixed\nin 1933. When the Mathematics and\nMeteorology departments at present\nhoused within it are moved to the new\nbuilding in 1974, the name will move\nwith them and the building will again be\nused for government purposes.\nThe exhibition traces the history of\nthe School of Mines and other constituent colleges of Imperial College from\ntheir foundation until the beginning of\nthe first World War, using items taken\nusually from the Imperial College At\",\nchives. The exhibition lis arranged by the\nCollege Archivist, Mrs. J. Pingree, who\nhas also compiled an excellent companion catalogue. It is open until November 4, and is worth visiting if only\nto find out what COULD be done in\nthe Hux.\n(Article adapted from foreword to Exhibition catalogue with additional material from our own reporter).\n2. Andrzej Kuhn's Paintings\nThere is at present, in the Consort\nGallery (alias the Ante-Room, College\nBlock) an exhibition of some 36 paintings by Andrzej Kuhn. Although the\nimages themselves are somewhat reminiscent of Children's Hour, or some fairytale one remembers from childhood, the\ncollection is colourful, bold and refresh-ing. Like so many other painters, we see\ncertain \"pet\" themes in most of Kuhn's works. Particularly evident are longships\nsimilar if not identical to those of olden\ndays in Norway. Also present in great\nnumbers are huge, bright yellow, suns.\nThere is barely a dull colour to be seen\nanywhere and the whole colour content\nof the paintings falls into three cate gor ies: blocks clearly defined, patterns usually based on ia chequered design, or,\nfinally, blended in a way Which is like\na macroscopic view of the blending\nshown by the French impressionists.\nThe shape of the figures portrayed is\nalso an interesting and important factor in the overall expression one gains\nfrom an individual painting.\nI'm sorry to say that there were no\nmore viewers during the time I was in\nthe gallery, since this relatively small exhibition really is worth a visit if ever\nyou have five minutes to spare as you\npass through College Block \u2014 it is even\nwell worth a detour.\n\n"

In this, the last of their\nB% IIIjl V WW rill II2f two articles, they explain in detail how to prepare your CurricuHow to compose your Curriculum\nVitae\nPersonal Specification\nList all your past history and ex-peri en ce. Your education, past em-ploy ment, sport, hobbies, voluntary\nwork, and anything else you can think\nof. You probably have experience in\nmore fields than you realise. If you\nare a retiring member of one of the\nservices you will certainly have experience which will be useful in many\ntypes of civilian employment. If you\nhave been a salesman your experience will be important in many jobs\nwhich do not directly involve selling.\nYour list will serve two purposes:\na. It forms the raw material of\nyour Curriculum Vitae.\nb. It will give a lead to your abi li ties, and may help you in deciding just what type of new\nvocation you want.\nJob Specification\nHaving listed your own experience\nyou now need to determine exactly\nwhat type of experience is necessary\nfor the type of job for which you are\nlooking. So make out another list detailing qualifications, experience and\nspecial skills which you consider\nnecessary for the job.\nIf you compare this job specification list with your own specification,\nyou are now ready to compile your\nCurriculum Vitae.\nCompiling your Curriculum Vitae\nSelect from your personal specification the details which are most important for the type of job you are\nseeking. In other words match your\nperso anl specification to the job\nspecification, stressing the experience which is most relevant. The result should give you the details which\nshould be incorporated in your Curriculum Vitae.\nLaying our your Curriculum Vitae\nYour Curriculum Vitae should be\npresented in tabular form under clear\nheadings. This enables the interviewer to refer to any particular part\nquickly and easily.\nEvery copy of your Curriculum\nVitae must look as though it has been\nindividually typed. Curriculum Vitae\nwhich have been photo-copied or\nstencil duplicated may give the impression that you apply for a large\nnumber of jobs, without taking too\nmuch trouble. The best way to produce your Curriculum Vitae is to have\nit expertly typed and printed by offset litho, this will give the appearance\nof each page having been separately\ntyped. (Details of our service for doing this are enclosed).\nAt the top of your Curriculum Vitae\nyou should clearly set out your Name,\nAddress and Telephone number, (re-member it may become detached\nfrom the covering letter of app lica tion), and your age, marital status\nand number fo children. (Don't list\nchildrens names, etc., it's of no interest at this stage).\nAlways leave at least one and a half inches in the left hand column,\npapers are frequently filed and holes\nmay be punched in some important\npart of the information. Now list the\nrest of the information under the following headings:\nEducation. List schools attended\nwith dates and examinations passed.\nHigher Technical Education. List\nUniversities and degrees. Also any\nprofessional or technical qualifications which are relevant to the type\nof job for which you are applying.\nWrite your qualifications in full\u2014do\nnot give a list of \"letters\".\nMilitary Service. Give dates and\nRegiment, but do not go into too much\ndetail unless it is specifically connected with the type of job for which you\nare looking. Never use service term in ology.\nCareer. List the post you have held\nwith the dates. Your most recent experience is almost certainly the most\nimportant, and you may wish to go\ninto into brief details. Otherwise simply list the Firm, the position held and\nthe time involved. You may emphasise\nthe position which you feel has the\nmost bearing on the type of job for\nwhich you are applying, but no one\nwill be particularly interested in how\nmuch you earned as an office boy 15\nyears ago. If your income has shown\na good steady increase in your last\ntwo or three positions, indicate this;\nparticularly if the money offered for\nthe job you are applying for will continue this progression.\nMiscellaneous. Finally indicate any\nother points which you consider relevant. These may include languages,\ntravel experience, sport, committee\nmemberships, etc.\nYou now have a completed Curriculum Vitae. Read it through and cut\nout anything which is not essential.\nIf possible try and fit it onto one page.\nObviously, however, the more experience you have the more space you\nwill require to set it out. The important thing to bear in mind is that the\nprospective employer has a lot of\napplications to read, and if you\nramble on and bore him you don't stand a changes. A Curriculum Vitae\nwhich conjures up a picture of you,\ninteresting enough to invite you for\nan interview, and taking as little time\nas possible to read, is ideal from the\nreaders point of view. As a rule let's say that a single page Curriculum\nVitae is probably better than two\npages, but two pages are better than\nthree!\nYour Curriculum Vitae is your advertisement of you. If it interests the\nprospective employer sufficiently to\ninvite you along for an interview,\nthen it has succeeded. The details\nwill be discussed at the interview.\nMethod of Approach\nYou now have prepared your letter\nof application and your Curriculum\nVitae. The letter of application states\nwhy you are applying for the job, and\nrefers to the Curriculum Vitae for\nmore detail. The Curriculum Vitae\nshould sufficiently whet the readers\nappetite for him to invite you along\nfor an interview. The interview is the\ntime for more detailed examination\nof you and of the job for which you\nare applying.\nSeeking a new job is hard work.\nIt also demands a reappraisal of yourself and your future expectations. If\nyou follow the foregoing advice you\nwill find that the composition of your\nCurriculum Vitae is valuable not only\nin presenting yourself to a potential\nemployer, but also in clarifying your\nown ideas about yourself.\nJob hunting is essentially a marketing operation. Your plan of action\nshould be as follows:\n1. Evaluate the product, i.e. your-self.\n2. Evaluate the market, i.e. the\nposition you are looking for.\n3. Prepare your approach to the\nmarket. These will include:\nReplying to advertisements.\nDirect approach by letter to\nselected companies.\nPersonal introductions.\nAsk your friends for advice.\nEmployment agencies and\nConsultants. You cannot have\nyour name on too many\npeoples books.\nPersonal Approach\nHowever you make your approach\nthe more personal you make it the\nbetter it will be. People are flattered\nif you bother to find out their name.\nIt impresses them and it proves that\nyou have gone to some trouble. Before you write to any firm, phone up\nfind out who will be reading your\napplication, and then address it to\nhim personally.\nFollow Up\nFew people bother to follow up\ntheir application. They send them off\nand then leave it to the prospective\nemployer to contact them, either inviting them along for an interview, or\nelse sending a letter which begins\n\"We regret to inform you\". Originality\nand determination are useful qu ali ties, and if you phone up your prospective employer a few days after\nsending him your application, he is\nsure to be impressed. He may have\nhad so many applications that he is\nfinding it difficult to decide on a list\nfor interview, and your telephone call\nmay help him to make a decision. At\nany rate this way you must establish\na more personal contact, and your\nname will become more meaningful in\nhis mind than the other applicants\nwho are simply names on the top of\npieces of paper.\nReferences\nThere is little point in naming referees in your Curriculum Vitae. You\nwill almost certainly be required to\ngive a business reference and a character reference when you are finally\noffered the job, but not before. The\ndays of Testimonials starting \"To\nwhom it may concern . . . . \" are\nover, and today's references are more\npersonal and specific.\nIt is as well to have a list of suitable people prepared, who you know\nwill give you a reasonable recommendation, and it is good manners to\nwarn these people that you may be\nusing their names, (and thank them\nafterwards). Relatives are not usually\nacceptable as they are expected to\nbe biased (one way or the other).\nComing Events\nMONDAY 30th9.30 Consort Gallery, College Block: Paintings by Andrzej Kuhn\n-17.30 (until 10 Nov.).\n9.30- Huxley Building Centenary Commemorative Exhibition (until\n-21.30 3 Nov.).

However,\nthe time to lay the foundations for this monumental\npurchase is undoubtedly the\npresent. There is no need, at\nthis stage, to decide positively upon the method of\nrepayment of your future\nmortgage advance but it is\nas well to give some thought\nto the source from whom you\nhope to obtain the funds and\nalso the vehicle by which you\nintend to repay them.\nFirst, select your building\nsociety. Different societies\nhave different views on the\namount of money they will\nadvance to individuals and\nthe term over which they\nwill lend it. Membership of\na particular society will not\nguarantee a mortgage of any\nparticular size when you require it, but it will mean\nthat the society that you select will give you preference as\nan existing member, an advantage which can be invaluable, particularly when\nfunds are in short supply. A point to be borne in mind is\nthat whilst some societies will\npay a slightly higher rate of\ninterest on investments, they\nmight not be quite so generous when assessing the\namount of a mortgage advance in the future.\nMost societies offer similar\nforms of savings accounts,\nranging from the simple Investment Account, in which\na minimal sum may be deposited and added to or subtracted from at will to regular\nmonthly savings accounts\npaying a slightly higher rate\nof interest; government-link-ed S.A.Y.E. savings schemes\nover a term of five years and\nthe longer term insurance\nlinked bonds. Before deciding finally upon the type of\naccount which you wish to\nuse you would be well advised to discuss your future\nplans with someone conversant with the mortgage\nscene. The N.U.S. has its own\ninsurance advisory service\nwith a mortgage department\nwho are able to help with\nthis aspect.\nThere are two methods by\nwhich a mortgage may be repaid:\u2014\nA. The level monthly repayment method.\nEach month a sum is repaid to the building society\ncomprising interest and repayment of capital. Life\nassurance protection is not\nincluded in such an arrangement but it is very\nwise, in fact necessary, to\neffect a mortgage protection policy for the amount\nand term of the loan so\nthat in the event of the\ndeath of the borrower before the end of the selected period, the sum assured under this policy will\nrepay the outstanding\namount of the loan.\nB. The endowment method.\nAn endowment assurance\npolicy is one where a sum\nis payable at the end of\nan agreed period or on\ndeath of the assured.\nWith this method an endowment policy is effected\nfor an amount equal to the\nmortgage advance and for\nan identical term. The\npolicy is usually on the\nborrowers life and is assigned to the building soc-ie ty. However, no actual\nrepayment of capital is\nmade to the society during\nthe term of the mortgage.\nThe loan is repaid at the\nend of the selected period\nfrom the benefits payable\nwhen the endowment policy matures. In the event\nof the death of the borrower before the end of\nthe selected period, the\nsum assured repays the\nloan in full.\nThere will be two payments in this1 case, one\nconsisting of interest only\nto the building society and\nthe other, being the premium on the policy, to the insurance company concern-ed.\nAgain, at this stage, it\nwould be wise to take advice\nin order to make the necessary preparations.\nBuying a house\nFirst, find your house.\nMore often than not, you\nwill have been through many\nviewings before finding one\nto suit your taste and your\npocket. Negotiate a price\nwith the vendor (the seller).\nIf an estate agent has arranged the introduction he\nwould usually have to put\nyour offer to the vendor in\norder to confirm that it is\nacceptable to him. There is,\nhowever, nothing to stop you\nfrom negotiating direct with\nthe seller.\nAt this stage a \"holding\"\nor \"preliminary\" deposit is\noften required by an agent.\nThe sum is usually nominal\nand is often no more than\n\u00a325 or \u00a350. It does not form\npart of any legal transaction\nand is used merely to discourage frivolous enquiries.\nWhere possible payment\nshould be made through your\nsolicitor, although an agent\nwill often insist on the deposit being paid direct to\nhim. It is not usual for the\nfull deposit of 10 per cent to\nbe paid now. If there is no\nestate agent involved then\nyou should not hand over a deposit without first consulting your solicitor.\nIn all cases where a deposit is paid a receipt must\nbe obtained and it should always confirm that the deposit is paid \"subject to con-tract\". This means that you\ncan withdraw from the transaction and recover your deposit at any time before\ncontracts are exchanged.\nUnless these crucial words\nare included you could possibly lose your deposit\nshould you decide in the\nearly stages not to proceed\nas a result of a poor survey\nreport or difficulty in obtaining a mortgage.\nThe mortgage\nThis is the stage at which\nyour foundation planning\nwill come into its own as the\nobtaining of a mortgage can\nprove difficult if your circumstances or the type of\nproperty are in any way \"out\nof the ordinary\". Discuss the\nmatter again with your ad-visor.\nYou should also now take\nsteps to appoint a solicitor if\nyou do not already have one.\nIn this connection it is often\nfinancially advantageous to\nuse the same solicitor as the\nbuilding society through\nwhom you are obtaining your\nmortgage. The solicitor will\nwish to take instructions regarding the address of the\nproperty to be purchased, the\nname of the vendor and the\npurchase price.\nA survey\nHaving made your offer to\nbuy and perhaps paid a preliminary deposit you would\nbe wise to consider the question of a professional survey.\nIf you are buying the property with the aid of a mort-gage, the building society\nwill have the property surveyed at your expense. However this survey is merely a valuation of the property for\nthe benefit of the building\nsociety and you will not see\nthe report; neither will you\nbe able to take any action\nagainst the surveyor at a later date if anything goes\nwrong. Many people consider\nthat the fact that a building\nsociety is prepared to make\nan advance is sufficient re-assurance. However if you instruct your own surveyor you\nwill receive his report and\nit is his duty to give you an\naccurate survey. If he does\nnot he can be held responsible for compensation at\nsome time in the future. His\nreport will be detailed and\nwill contain details of the\nstructural condition of the\nproperty as a whole and not\nmerely with a view to setting\na value upon it.\nThe cost of a private survey depends upon the value\nof the property and you\nwould oe wise to make enquiries from the surveyor before instructing him to pro-cee d. If you have any difficulty\nselecting a surveyor to make\na report then you should\nhave a word with your soli-c it or. The legal aspect\nAt this early stage in the\npurchase your solicitors will\nrequest the vendor's solicitors to prepare and submit\na draft contract. This will\nconfirm the agreement to\nsell and to buy and also\ngives details of the vendor's legal right to dispose of the\nproperty.\nThe contract will cover\nmany aspects and should refer to a plan of the property.\nThis is to ensure that you are\npurchasing the house that\nyou wish to buy!\nThe vendor's land certificate or title deeds are produced to prove his right to\nsell and if the property is\nleasehold the lease will also\nhave to be inspected.\nThe time factor at this\nstage varies quite considerable depending upon the various formalities which have\nto be undertaken. However,\nwhilst awaiting receipt of a draft contract, your solicitor\nwill carry out certain local\nsearches on your behalf. The\nobject of these is to find out\nas much as possible about\nthe house that you are buying and the surrounding area\nand questions are asked of\nthe local authority. There are\nnumerous questions to be\nasked concerning such things\nas road widening, new roads\nand redevelopment plans but\nthe intention is to ensure\nthat there are no hidden\nsnags affecting your pur-chase. Your solicitor should\nnot permit you to enter any\ncommitment to buy without\nthe local authorities' answers\nbeing satisfactorily received.\nAt the same time various\n\"preliminary enquiries\" are\nalso made of the vendor's solicitor. The purpose of\nthese enquiries is to ascertain the rate able value of the\nproperty; who owns fences\nand walls, whether there are\nany disputes about bound-aries, whether planning permissions and building permissions have been obtained,\nthe earliest date on which\ncompletion may be arranged\nand numerous other ques-t ions. You should be kept informed of any relevant points\nraised by these enquiries.\nAll the previously mentioned searches and enquiries\nwill take some time to com-ple te, but generally speaking,\na minimum period of two\nweeks will probably elapse\nbefore everything is satisfactorily answered.\nWhen you have received\nconfirmation from your\nbuilding society that an advance will be made your\nsolicitor should then be in\na position to prepare a contract for signature. At this\npoint a completion date will\nbe decided upon and finally\ncontracts will be formally ex-changed.\nExchange of contracts\nContracts are formally exchanged when the copy which\nyou have signed is exchanged for the copy signed by\nthe vendor. The remainder of\nthe 10 per cent deposit is enclosed with your copy of the\ncontract. Your portion of the\ncontract has to be offered\nfirst; the vendor's is only returned in receipt of yours.\nYou may find it difficult\nat this stage to raise the remainder of the 10 per cent\ndeposit, particularly if you\nare depending upon the sale\nof an existing property to\nraise funds or if you are borrowing from a building society and providing less than\n10 per cent of the total your-self. If you have difficulties,\nyour solicitor or bankers will\nprobably be able to help.\nOnce contracts have been\nexchanged you are bound to\npurchase the property and\nyour deposit is not normally\nrecoverable unless there are\nvery exceptional c irc um stances.\nInsurance of the property\nOnce contracts are exchanged the property becomes your responsibility\nfrom the insurance point of\nview even though you will\nnot have moved in. The\nbuilding society granting\nyour mortgage will arrange\nthe insurance at your ex-pens e, normally debiting your\naccount. You should however,\nensure that the cover is for\nthe full market value of the\nproperty.\nFinal arrangements\nFollowing exchange of contracts and before completion\nyour solicitor will have to\nmake final searches to see if\nthere are any outstanding\nmatters affecting the pro-per ty. He will need to know\nif there is any mortgage on\nthe property which no arrangements have been made\nto repay. Final enquiries are\nalso made of the vendor's solicitors concerning such\nthings as the whereabouts of\nthe keys to the property.\nCompletion\nCompletion is normally\none month after the exchange of contracts but this\ncan be varied by agreement\nbetween yourself and the\nvendor. His solicitor will insert the actual date for completion into the contract.\nFinally the form of conveyance is passed to the ven-dor's solicitors for their\nagreement. This is the form\nthat the vendor will sign to\ntransfer the property to you.\nYour solicitor will submit his\nreport on title to the building society and arrange to obtain the mortgage cheque\nfrom them. He will also arrange for you to sign the\nmortgage deed and will advise you on any last minute\nqueries which you may have.\nCompletion takes place\nwhen the purchase price is\nhanded over in exchange for\nthe title deeds.\nThe conveyance has then\nto be submitted to the Inland\nRevenue for stamping and,\nin the case of registered\nland, to the land registry in\norder to ensure that your\nclaim to the property is cer-rect ly stated.\nConclusion\nThe whys and wherefores\nof buying a house are many\nand varied and each of the.\nabove processes will vary\nfrom one property to an-other. However, it is hoped\nthat these notes will make it\neasier for you to follow the\nvarious transactions, at the\nsame time demonstrating\nthat there is more to buying\na house than merely handing\nover the cash.\nNeed an in-depth approach\nto your subject ?\nThen pay a visit fo\n/.

If she\nwishes to have the Teasmaid\nwake her at 6.30 and then\nsay a prayer with husband\nEric, that is her prerogative,\nbut when she frantically tries\nto impose her illiberal,\nsmall-minded views on the\nrest of us it is tantamount to\nthe worst form of religious\npersecution.\nWhy is it that Mrs. Whitehouse and the rest of the\nWomens' Institute mob concentrate on the Beeb and\nnot towards the predominant\nbanality which the IBA puts\nout? Why, because IBA depends on advertising which\ndepends on large audiences\nwhich depends on status quo\nviewing and means very few\nprogrammes outside the\nmainstream of Hughie Green\nand the Golden Shit.\nSurely it is because the\nBeeb is occasionally forward thinking that the\nWhitehouses of Surbiton,\nfacing backwards with their\nmiddle-class heads buried in\nthe sand or in the latest\n'Playboy', object so vehemently. Hopefully her latest\noutbursts of Communist-inspired plots will lose her the\nill - conceived credibility\nwhich she has held in certain sections of the society.\nNot content to count the\nnipples displayed on the bed\nshe now lifts the covers and\nsearches for the reds under-neath.\nYours sincerely\nMARTIN DOUGHTY\nMooney milk\nshock increase\nSir.\u2014On Thursday a half-pint carton of milk (plus\ncup) cost 4p from College\nBlock Buttery.

I find\nit rather surprising that there\nhas been absolutely no mention at all in Felix so far this\nterm about the price rises\nthat have swept the cost of\nany Mooney meal upwards.\nJust about every item on\nthe Mooney menu has gone\nup ip or in some cases 1 p. There are no longer any\nprice lists on view in the\nunion lower refectory or the\nCollege Block buttery, thus\nstudents have not the opportunity to compare prices\nwith last year's and decide\nwhat to buy from an economic point of view. Why do\nwe sometimes get charged\ndifferent amounts for the\nsame meal on different\ndays? A comprehensive article on the Mooney refectory service, including facts\nabout his handling of fresh-ers' dinners, and answering\nthe questions I 've raised\nwith a complete run down of\nthe food prices is called for.\nSince no such service was\nforthcoming from 'I.C.s very\nown newspaper\", I have taken it upon my sel t as editor\nof one of the C.

I hope\nthis article will inspire the\nstaff of Felix to provide similar articles of interest to all\nstudents of the I.C. in the\nnot-too-distant future and\nnot to ignore vital issues\nsuch as wide-spread inflation\nin the College Refectories.\nYours sincerely,\nRON APPLEBY\n(Broadsheet Editor).\nIinstead\nScrap Heap\nSir\u2014If certain people are to\nbe believed, students are\nmore aware than anyone else\nof environmental pollution,\nbut the male of the species\nstill shows a remarkable\nability to foul his own nest.\nI refer to the car park behind Linstead Hall, which is\nsteadily accumulating a fine\nselection of used car parts,\ngeneral rubbish, oil cans\n(empty, or full of old engine\noil) and, inevitably, dumped\nmotor-cars.\nMy room commands a view of this deplorable mess,\nand so, to avoid offending my\neyes, as well as others,\ncould the people who use\nthe place as an open-air\nworkshop please remove\ntheir own pollution when fin-is he d?I am well aware that\nnot all of the rubbish is the\nwork of hall residents, but\npeople can search their own\nsouls on that score.

The opinion poll that we published last week showed\nthat as early as the Friday before the election many had the intention\nof registering an abstention, and the amount of literature put around\nthe college by the constituent college Unions over the weekend\nclinched the matter. On Monday morning, when balloting opened,\nleading executive members were still more than doubtful that this propaganda would have any positive effect other than people staying\naway from the polls: but on Tuesday evening, when it was learnt that\nthe magic threshold figure of one thousand had been reached, and\nthe poll was valid, no-one had any further doubts.\nFor those of you who\nhave been dazed by the\nevents of recent weeks\nand/or have missed our\narticles and Union meet-in gs, and of course for\nthe Martians who will be\nreading \"Felix\" in centuries' time and wondering\nwhat the heck we were all\nup to in 1972, it would\nseem worthwhile to reproduce here a potted guide\nto election procedure and\nhow it has operated over\nthe last few weeks.\nEvery Spring, the President, Secretary and Deputy\neditorial\ncomment President (and for that\nmatter the Editor of\n\"Felix\") for the coming\nacademic year are elected\nby college-wide ballot.\nThese elections are conducted in the same way as\na Parliamentary election,\nthough on a necessarily\nsmaller scale.

Was\nthis another Union meeting? \u2014 couldn't be, not a paper\ndart in sight. What was this gathering of people, clothed\nin garb so rarely seen. Could it be a rehearsal for\nCommemoration Day? No . . . it was the real thing. A few seconds before, as the procession of college dignitaries crawled forward the Albert Hall was transformed\ninto Westminster Abbey \u2014 the choir singing and the\npeople standing.\nThus it came to pass\nthat MCB stood at the\nrostrum. Was it the\nminutes of the last Union\nmeeting he was reading?\nA list of parking allocations? No. It was just the\nintroduction to the ceremony. The half full (or\nhalf empty, if you're a pessimist) Albert Hall was\ntense with excitement,\nnecks craning, ears intent\non the softest whisper and\neyes straining to witness\nthe strange rites to be performed that afternoon.\nLord Penney in his last\nrector i al address was mercifully short but, alas, the\npresentation of associate-ships which followed\nproved not to be so. What\ncan be said of those 50\nminutes? Sweet music\nstraining from the stage,\nthe fragrance of the flowers and as each cloaked\nfigure advanced across the\nstage the loudspeakers\nboomed a name.\nThe results of three academic years are acknowledged by a bow from the\nchairman of the board of\ngovernors.

However, it is precisely the lack\nof this information that invariably leads to the vast\nmajority of the electorate\nregarding each impending\nelection with total in comprehension. This election was worse.\nNot only was there a great\nincrease in the lack of\ncomprehension of the election procedure, since a third of the electorate had\nonly three weeks' experience of the college and the\nunion, and thus no knowledge of the elections, but\nof those that were \"in the\nknow\", few could bring\nthemselves to enthusiastically endorse the candidature of either Rob Armitage or Adrian Smith.\nThe election was necessitated by Chris Sheppard,\nPresident-Elect from this\nspring's elections, deciding\nto withdraw from his exa.minations and failing to\nobtain the permission of\na Union General Meeting\nto take up the post of\nPresident whilst not being\n\"of good academic stand-ing\". So nomination\npapers were duly posted\non the first day of term,\nand the names of Adrian\nSmith and Rob Armitage\nduly appeared thereon.\nRob Armitage was Chairman of Rag last year, and\nis External Affairs Officer\nthis: yet despite this connection with the Union, he\nappears to be little known\noutside the Union Office,\nwhere he is a popular fi-gu re. Adrian Smith has,\nlike Rob, a firm grasp of\nstudent politics, but is a self-declared lefty, which\nis little asset in a college\nas staunchly Liberal as\nImperial.\nMany, it would seem,\nlooked at the election lineup and despaired. The\nexecutives of the constituent colleges went further.\nThey put it in writing.\nThey had their statement\nread out at a \"Meeting of\nImperial College Students\" (alias the in quo rate Hustings Union General\nMeeting of two weeks'\nago) and then proceeded\nto instruct their members,\nby means of concentrated\npropaganda distribution, to\nabstain from the election.\nThat is, not just to stay\naway from the polls, but\nto go and vote and write\n\"Abstention\" across the\nballot paper. They declared that neither candidate was fit to be President, and that this was the\nonly way to show it.\nIt worked. The CCU's have shown how powerful\nthey can be. But where has\nit left Imperial College\nUnion? It will now be\nnecessary to hold another\nelection in about four\nweeks' time. It is imperative that we do end up\nwith a President this time\naround. A continuation of\nhis fiasco amuses only the\nmost puerile members of\nthe Union. It will thus be\nnecessary that at least one\ncandidate stands who it\nwill be generally agreed is\ncapable of doing the job\nproperly.\nOne would think that\nthe constituent College\nUnions would now feel\nobliged to put up a candidate who they consider\nworthy of the post. Whether or not they do will\nremain to be seen. Rumours of who might stand\nare rife. I do not propose\nto soil these pages or\n\"Felix's\" name by indulging in printing their names\nhere. It is however safe\nto say that they do not\ninclude the names of any\nwho might induce a landslide victory, or indeed\nany whose candidature\ncould be openly welcomed\nby the broad mass of students at Imperial. There\nare, indeed, very few\nnames that spring to mind\nwho would fit into this\ncategory. It is perhaps because some of them would\nnot wish, at this stage at\nleast, to take a sabbatical\nyear. What is not generally known is that the\nPresident does not HAVE to take this. It would undoubtedly be in the best\ninterests of the Union and\nits members to have a non-sabbatical president if\nthis would induce a capable and popular person to\ntake on the job. The role\nof the President would revert to being the figurehead of the Union: we\ncan manage for the rest of\nthe year Without the extra\nwork that he or she would\ntake on if sabbatical . . .\nwell, just.\nWhat happens for the\nnext four weeks, then, until a new president, sabbatical or not, is elected? Ian\nMackenzie has now finished his term as \"Acting\nPresident\" \u2014 Council will\npresumably take up its option on appointing a further one at its meeting on\nMonday next. Until the\nnext elections are over, the\nfeeling in the Union Office will remain one of\nunease. If the next election is a fiasco, Imperial\nCollege Union will lose\nmuch of its credibility.\nThis must not be allowed\nto happen. But we may\nhave to do more than keep\nour fingers crossed.\nNEXT TIME\nYOU'RE IN...\nThe 57th Imperial College Commemoration Day\nceremony was held last Thursday in the Royal\nAlbert Hall to commemorate the visit to the college\nof Mr. Piers Corbyn now President of the Real\nEstate Fund of America.\nMr. Corbyn, described by the then Rector, Lord\nPenney as \"a man who brought sanity to Imperial\nCollege\", was greeted on his arrival by a rendering\nof his favourite pieces, Handel's\" A cacophony of\nWhite Noise\", Mozart's \"The 120 Decibel Suite\",\nand Debussy's \"Midnight in Moscow\" played simultaneously on the bells of Queen's Tower. Asked if he\nremembered the Tower with great nostalgia he declined to answer, apparently entranced by the melodic sound but later found to be stone deaf.\nThe afternoon began with the student orator, the\nlate Mr. M. Black, the Grand Master of the Worshipful company of Blackhead Squeezers, telling the\nstory of \"a man and his St. Bruno\". Just as an\nanonymous assassin in the rear balcony uncovered a sawn-off shotgun and was about to pick his spot the\norator abandoned his speech and began picking his\nspots, muttering \"it's finger licking good\"( believed\nto be a reference to take-away Kentucky chicken).\nThe highlight of the proceedings then followed\nwhen several hundred eminent members of the KIuKlux-Klan enshrouded in their bizarre and ethereal\nceremonial costume slowly marched across the stage\ndemonstrating against the immigration of Ugandan\nAsians. A splendid and moving occasion reached a climax as each and every marcher shook hands\nwith the beloved orator.\nAlthough those named Aaron-Adams seemed a little nonchalant in their approach, those further\ndown the alphabet showed progressively greater affection for the orator as their handshakes lingered\nlong in deep esteem.\n\"It's finger licking good\", said the orator.\n...TRY THE\nFAMILY BUCKET\nTHE GREAT\nTARTAN RACE\nOnce again the brewers\nof Younger's Tartan beer\nare promoting their Charity Race between Edinburgh and London. Next\nyear's event will start on\n31st March and end by\n4th April, 1973, to avoid\nclashing with exams (!?)\nThe challenge is to\ntransport an empty, note\nempty, 501b. beer cask by\nfair means or foul between\nMeadowbank Sports Stadium, Edinburgh and the\nRoyal Scot Hotel, King's Cross Road, London (near\nthe main line termini).\nThe race was such a success last year (although IC\nteams were conspicuous\nby their absence), that a wider range of categories\nhas been devised. These\nare:\n(a) Fastest team between\nEdinburgh and London;\n(b) Team collecting most\ncash for their nominated\ncharity between the two\ncities;\n(c) Team making the most\nunconventional journey between Edinburgh and\nLondon.\nIf the challenge were not\nenough, the winning teams\nin each class will receive\n\u00a3250, and ten dozen cans\nof you-know-what ale will\nbe given to each member.\nThe sponsors will then\ncontribute \u00a3250 to each\nwinning team's nominated\ncharity.\nThere will also be two\nteams of runners-up, per\nclass, each individual receiving \"Beer for a Year\",\nand spot prizes for individual journeys. The sponsors will also pay each\nteam member of each\nselected team \u00a330 for ex-pens es.

C.1st XV played\nCity of London Poly, and annihilated them by 75\u20143.\nCLP were not in the same class as IC or anywhere\nnear it, and the general feeling in the IC dressing\nroom after the game was one of disgust. It must be\nnoted that IC played with 14 men for nearly all of\nthe game, as McDonough left the field with a knee\ninjury but it made no difference, as can be seen from\nthe result. The general opinion of the 1st XV is that\nif better Wednesday fixtures cannot be found then\nwe might as well train by ourselves in Hyde Park,\nbecause that's all this game was \u2014 a glorified training\nsession. One can only sym pathis e with a team so\nhopelessly outclassed. An improved Wednesday fixture\nlist would be obtained perhaps if funds were available\nfor travel to play such university sides as Southampton,\nBristol, Birmingham, etc., which are all within easy\nreach with the present Motorway system, but this is\nonly speculation. Hopefully the other London colleges\nwill provide better opposition than did City Poly.\nTeam: \u2014 D. Rimmer, J. Hunt, J. Rose, R. Stern,\nJ. McDonough (captain), A. James, C. Flanagan, B.

I spoke too soon about the\nI.C.l st XV's unbeaten record. The 1st team did in\nfact lose to Old Surbitonians last Saturday by 19 points\nto 0. After the easy win on Wednesday (see abo vie\\ IC were far too complacent: there was too low a work\nrate from the forwards and far too many tackles were*\nmissed in the backs and it was on the whole a very-disappointing performance by the first team. Old\nSurbitonians were a well drilled side and very fit and\nmobile, and fully deserved their victory. It might be\nnoted that James turned up with ONE boot (typical)\u2014\nthe only thing worth laughing about in the whole after-noon.\nTeam: D. Rimmer, D. Osborne, T. Bradbury, R. Stern, J. Hunt, A. James, C. Flanagan, B. Bradley,\nD. Robinson, K. Horsman, C. Humphries, A. Smith,\nJ. Partridge, R. Matthews (capt.), A. Walton.\nHowever, a far better performance was put up by\nIC on Wednesday when we played King's College away\nfrom home and defeated them by 55-3. The game was\nreasonably tight for the first half hour and in fact the\nscore at one stage was 4-3. However, the big IC pack\nbegan to dominate the game and the ball flowed freely\nto the King's line on numerous occasions. Yet again\nMatthews managed to poach 3 tries out of the 10\nscored altogether. The fluent handling (sometimes)\nof the IC backs led to both wings, Jim Hunt and John\nMcDonough, bagging a pair of tries each. A good\nall round performance by IC then, and this must t augur well for their defence of the Gutteridge Cup \u2014\nprovided the dangers of complacency are recognised.\nTeam: D. Rimmer, J.

During the past week they suffered defeats at St. Cath's, Cambridge, 1\u20142, and at U.C.,1 \u20147.\nOn Saturday, October 21, the l st XI travelled to\nCambridge with some confidence after a good game at\nWANTED\nThis man has disappeared with a pair of\nknees belonging to\n\" FELIX' V front page\nand other miscellaneous photographs. If\nfound please knock into\nlast Sunday afternoon\nand return to Press\nRoom.\nGuys on the previous Wednesday. However, from the\nstart St. Cath's took control; their inside-left, unmarked\nin the. centre of the D, scored after a mix-up in the\nright of the defence.\nIn the rest of the first half, the game flowed from\nend to end, even the opposition goalkeeper was called\ninto action on a number of occasions with a lot of\ngood work done by the wingers, Gaukroger and Richman.\nAt the start of the second half St. Cath's again came\nstrong with continual pressure for the opening minutes,\nbut the game again became' fairly even with I.C. equal-ising from a short corner, Dave Richman being the\nexecutioner.\nA draw seemed the likely result until, in the last\nminute, bad judgement by Boulton in the I.C. goal\nallowed a very weak shot to creep in past the post.\nWednesday, October 25, saw the death of I.C.s3 \u20143\u20144 system. U.C., with a couple of tricky stock\nplayers \u2014 and also ones that could stop the ball \u2014\ncompletely over-run I.C. with three goals in ten minutes\nand four by half-time.\nThe second-half was the same one-way action with\nU.C. adding three more. However, on one of the few\noccasions he received the ball, Dave Rickman managed to round all the U.C. defence except for a full\nback who used his legs on the line. John Astley converted the penalty flick.\nAt least one I.C. team won last week, namely the\nmixed XI who visited QEC and struggled to a3 \u20141\nwin. The goals all came from the Feline family \u2014 two\nfor Mr. and one for Mrs.\nLadies' Hockey\nWednesday, 18th October saw a home match for I.C. Ladies (?) l st( and only) XI against Westfield College.\nWe managed to field eleven players after persuading\nour umpire to play (we have a desperate shortage of\nplayers particularly forwards so if anyone is interested,\nplease contact the captain, Janet Manfield: Int. phone\nnumber 2508).\nSince we for once, had a full term, it came as a great\ndisappointment when only eight opposition members\nturned up. Undeterred and in need of practice, we lent\nthem a player and played nine-a side with an umpire\nfor fifteen minutes until the three Westfield lost sheep\narrived. When the match resumed, it was decided to\nplay the remaining fifteen minutes of the first half and\na thirty-minute second half on the grounds that most\nof us wouldn't have lasted a full half an hour each way.\nThe exact moments when the goals came cannot be\nremembered but I.C. scored three and let Westfield have\none so that they wouldn't. feel too badly about being\nbeaten.\nRESULT: I.C.3. WESTFIELD 1.\nTEAM: Janet Peacock, Margaret Cunningham (also\nthe umpire), Lynne Beynon, Hilary Rowson, Geraldine\nBowden, Mary Hill, Anne Purvis, Shirley Fairweather,\nJane Purvis, Janet Manfield (captain), Jane Gywn.\nWednesday, 25th October was another match at\nHarlington, this time against King's College. Faced\nwith our usual lack of players, we fielded only ten;\nKing's even less fortunate, had only nine. The only difficulty about this game was that we, as usual, had no\numpire. Margaret Cunningham umpired and played for\nus in the first half and a member of King's team umpired the second half. As a result, there were many\nminor infringements of the rules (apologies for things\nlike delayed tackles and deliberate fouls were made\nafterwards) but I.C. still swept on to a decisive 6-2\nvictory, Lynne Beynon (Centre Forward) scoring four\nexceptionally good goals and Margaret Cunningham\n(Right Inner) accounting for the other two.\nRESULT: I.C.6. KINGS 2.\nTEAM: Janet Peacock, Margaret Cunningham,\nLynne Beynon, Geraldine Bowden, Mary Hill, Anne\nPurvis, Maureen King, Jane Purvis, Janet Manfield\n(Captain), Jacqui Buzzard.\nTiddlywinks\nOn Sunday, 22nd October, a band of intrepid win kers comprising 6 members of Maths 3 and 3 human beings,\nset forth on the road for Folkestone. Armed with\nsquid gers we attacked a social club, where the opposition trembled at the sight of l.C. Winks Club. We\nplayed up to our normal brilliant standard, amassing\na total of 1\\ points to their 55J, thus retaining our\nunbeaten beaten record.\nOne game in the final round caused a sensation\u2014\nnever before in the history of winks have both players\ngone for the pot. These tactics bamboozled our opponents and produced an incredibly fast game which ended\nin a discussion about Helen's assets, while all the others\nwere still playing pot-s quo p. After demolishing sandwiches and beer, we headed\nstraight up the A20 to Southside Bar, only to be foiled\nby a faulty water pump in one of the cars. If anyone\nsees five lonely souls still wandering round the South\nCircular Road, please direct them to Huxley basement\nwhere a tense world awaits their return with bated\nbreath and problem sheets.\nThanks to Glyn and Mike for transport.\nTeam: \u2014 Helen Isaac, Bob Douglas, Chris Cartledge, Tony Bush, Mike Ixer, Glyn Jones, Neil Gray,\nJohn James and Derrick Lowe.\nPedal Cars\nSunday, October 22, saw the Jaguar Grand Prix held\nbetween the V12 E types at the Jaguar works in Coventry. (No. they are NOT serious, Ed.) The race was\na quick five hour sprint round a simple and pleasantly\nflat track. Four I.C. entries consisted of our usual two\nGuilds' cars and two from Mines.\nNo. 14, \"Little Bo\", ran as consistently as ever to\ntake first place on handicap. No. 15, \"Big Bo\" came a creditable sixth despite b razing the crankshaft together\ntwice. I 've no idea what happened to the Mines cars\nbut they seemed quite happy messing around in the\nbackground.\nGuilds' teams consisted of:\nLittle Bo\nStewart Moult\nPhil Smyth\nKeith Reynish\nPete Wilkins\nJohn Coxon\nAndy Stevens\nBig Bo\nDave John\nDave Willey\nSteve Wright\nPete Cramb\nIan Jennions\nPaul Cotter\nThanks to everyone for coming along.\n(Ed's note: Apologies to Mines for this report being\nbiased: please send us a report next time yourselves \u2014\nand that goes for everyone else too!)\nsmall\nads*** A RED FOLDER was removed from outside the buttery in college block on\nWednesday last at lunch-time.

Not\nhaving seen the first programme (or, for that\nmatter, any TV at all for two months at least) my\nonly knowledge of the programme was what I had heard from people who had seen it (who had\nvery mixed opinions) and the information that I had been sent. The general impression I had got\nwas that it was rather long and at times very\nboring.\nWell, two and a quarter hours is a long time.\nBut it seems to pass very quickly, sitting in the\nstudio. The programme is of the magazine var-ie ty, combining films, plays, poetry and art held\ntogether in the studio by Joe Melia with this\naudience of 100 or so who are meant to discuss\nthe art forms shown on the programme. The\nonly discussion, in fact, was about some \"Con-c ep tu al Art\" by Stuart Brisley, who, we kept being assured, was not a looney . . . despite the\nfact that his concept of conceptual is m was to\nrise from a bath filled with black paint and\nanimals' lights as Dracula from the grave, and\nthen proceed to chuck the lights on the carpet in\nfront of him. I'm afraid it conveyed nothing to\nme, other than that Mr. Brisley lacked the integrity that he was meant to possess. It seems that\nhe's been sitting in this bath of muck for months\nnow, and rising at frequent intervals for the\nbenefit of the multitudes.\nBoth the film (of \"The Two Gallants\", by James\nJoyce) and the play (\"Juvenalia\" by E.A. Whitehead) seemed incoherent, and the former I found very difficult to grasp the meaning of. This\nwas doubtless partly due to the obscured view\nthat I had and the distraction of moving cameras\nand booms and things.\nHowever, I enjoyed the play: it surprised me\nhow well it worked in such a setting. Maybe I should explain: the audience is arranged in\nclover-leaf formation around a small area in\nwhich all the \"action\" takes place; all the time\nthat you are watching something on film on your\ntelly set, things are being moved into this area\nfor the next live bit. Thus one gains on the live\nhappenings by being in the studio, but loses out\non the filmed parts\u2014it's very difficult to concentrate. I really did enjoy, most of all, the other sec-t ions: Charles Causley's poems, \"Cantores in\nEcclesia\" singing Vaughan Williams' settings\nof Shakespeare songs, and the Cannonball Adderley Quintet, a really tremendous jazz group.\nIt is certainly an experience, and if you feel\nloquacious, there's no reason why you shouldn't be heard and seen on millions of TV sets across\nthe country. \"Felix\" has been assured of a regular\nsupply of tickets to the Saturday night performances, and if you would like to go, please contact the Editor. The supply is VERY LIMITED\u2014\nfirst comers only! In future weeks the Ballet\nRambert, Julian Bream and John Williams,\nGladys Knight and the Pips, the Netherland Wind\nEnsemble and Roxy Music will all be appearing:\nthere will be a varied diet of plays including\n\"After Liverpool\" by James Saunders and the\nfinal one of the E.A. Whitehead trilogy, and\nmany original forms of visual art. The full details\nare not available until nearer the time; if\ncome along to the \"Felix\" office, we'l all the details.\nFinally, the BBC is to be applauded for putting\non an arts programme in the middle of Saturday\nevening instead of the usual midnight midweek\nslot reserved for interesting programmes. I hope\nthat it will get the ratings that it deserves.\nyou\ngive you\nRecords\nJOHN CALE: \"The Academy in Peril\" (WEA-Reprise)\nLast week someone remarked to me that more\npeople would read my reviews if I reviewed\nsomething with more mass appeal, so here I go\nfolks. \"Top of the Pops Volume DXXXXIV\" is\na superb collection of spiff n if i cent ly delivered\ntunes so much like the originals that you'll wish\nyou never bought a single in your life. It contains\nXerox-copy versions of. . . .\"\nRight! Now after my little sell-out to the snivelling masses I can continue with this classic of\nobscurity that makes \"Lumpy Gravy\" (see issue\n315) seem a veritable \"Top of the Pops Volume (cont.) P. DXXXXIV).\nJohn Cale was, like Lou Reed, one of the\nfounder members of the Velvet Underground,\nand left after the second album. Since then his\noutput of music has been varied, to say the least;\nhe produced an album by the frightful Iggy and\nthe Stooges, and two Nico albums. He made\na solo album of pop songs with avant garde\nlyrics, \"Vintage Violence\", and a duet album\nwith that master of the avant garde, Terry Riley\n(\"Church of Anthrax\"), and now this one, which\nis completely different to any of his previously\nrecorded work.\n\"Academy in Peril\" is Cale playing his roots;\nthere are three sweeping orchestral pieces, and\nthree essays into pian is m which I find at the\nmoment totally uncommunicative. This paying\nof classical dues takes up over half the album,\nand it's the remaining four tracks which interest\nme particularly. \"The Philosopher\" which opens\nthe album, is very difficult to describe\u2014over a \"backing track\" of bass drum and percussive\nacoustic guitar a trumpet and a violin fade in,\nand out; occasionally there's a rumble on the\nkettle drums. It reminds one of \"Children of the\nRevolution\" by T. Rex\u2014is that a recommendation or otherwise?\u2014and I like it. \"Legs Larry\nat the Television Centre\" features that famous\nex-Bonzo Dog Band drummer commenting on\nJohn Cale playing a cello solo, like a queer T.V. producer \"Tch Tch Silly Cat smudged his makeup now. Mind your boom love, mind your boom!\"\nIt's a bit of a laugh.\n\"Intro/Days of Steam\" is another piece that\nit's almost impossible to describe, you just have\nto listen to it, but \"King Harry\" really is worth\na mention. It begins with the sound of thunder.\nThen a xylophone strikes up a phrase and continues it till the end. The only other instrument\nis a trumpet, but Cale cackles into the microphone a sort of gloating lament for Henry VIII,\nalthough it isn't historically completely accurate.\nHowever it's guaranteed to spook you.\nWhen this album was played on a \"What's New\" radio programme the reviewer made passing mention of the music and proceeded immediately to the cover. This is indeed remarkable\nand was designed by Andy Warhol. It shows\nvarious views of Cale through what look like\ncolour slides, and may draw your attention to\nthe album as you thumb through the selections\nin a record shop. If you do find it, bring it from\nits obscurity and enjoy. It's well worth a listen.\nSomething with lots of mass appeal next week\nfolks.\nPaperbacks\nThe Preserving Machine and Other Stories\nPhilip K. Dick (Pan, 35p).I must admit that normally I would not put\nmyself in the group of readers that read masses\nof science fiction. Sometimes I find SF interest-ing: but most of the time it seems to be just a boring variation on a theme.\nIt reminds me greatly of a revamped cops and\nrobbers amongst the stars where the hero is\ngenerally humanoid and the villain is the shapeless alien. Although in some of his stories Mr.\nDick falls into some of these traps, he generally\nhas the knack to give his story a realistic zing\nto it. Where he cannot do this then his plot is\nso viable in a scientific (physics, etc.) sense as\nto grip the reader the same way that science\ngrips some of us.\nFrom the outside the book doesn't attract\nmuch attention: in fact, the jacket is quite boring\nin relation to other recently reviewed books. The\nfirst story, some ten pages long, is an excellent\nbeginning: it is clever, frightening and reaches\nits climax sufficiently soon for it to attract one\nfurther into the book.\nThe stories range from the testing of alien\ntoys exported to earth (tested to see if there is\nany secret psychological weapon cleverly hidden\nto injure, or subvert children) to the job of standby President of the United States, which surely\nmust be about the greatest non-job around.\nIf you fancy a change from the recent spate of\nMafia and Hi-jacking novels, then the \"Preserv-ing Machine\" would make an obvious choice.\nThe \"Sunday Times\" thought that Mr. Dick's characters were highly credible: I would go further and say that they were highly human . . .\nor Martian . . . or Venusian . . . or, well, read the\nstories and see for yourself.\nClassics\n-Of October's classical release perhaps the\nmost exciting has been the Phillips' issue of\nChopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, No.\nSAL 6500 309 \u2014 soloist Claudio Arrau. Mr.\nArrau's playing makes compulsive listening and I can recommend this record to anyone who wishes\nto add to their collection a first class performance\nof this work.\nChopin's music is open to two extremes of\ninterpretation \u2014 that of the exaggerated, soul\nful, romantic style or that of the rather crisp\nmatter of fact approach. Claudio Arrau seems to\nstrike a path in between the two and the result of\nhis interpretation, together with the London Philharmonic Orchestra's very sound ac com pani ment, is beautiful to listen to.\nThe second movement especially shows Mr.\nArrau at his best. Here his keyboard sensitivity\ntruly expresses the lyrical beauty of the Larghetto.\nThe other piece on the record is the less well-known Krakowaik, written one year before the\nconcerto in 1828 and the contrast between the\ntwo musical styles is very noticeable. Again the\nplaying is of the highest standard revealing the\nKrakowiak's rather elaborate and effervescent\ncharacter.\n\n"
