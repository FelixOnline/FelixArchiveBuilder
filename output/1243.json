    "content": "i1& ti lO MUSIC REVIEWS FELIX Albums & Singles\nJust Jack\nParadise Those of you who like The Streets\nand Faithless may like this album.\nJack Allsopp, a north Londoner,\nalong with his six compatriots,\nhas made a pretty good debut\nalbum. It starts off positive with\nthe song Let's Get Really Honest,\nusing a sample from I'm Not In\nLove (1995). My initial thought\nwas \"The Beatles, no... The\nAvalanches, no... Air\". It was\nnone of them but it was good.\nThe following tune Paradise really sets the theme for the album\nRhianna\nGet On Get On is the mature, polished,\nslick and sassy debut from\nLeeds-born Rhianna. Opening\nwith the soulful single Oh Baby,\nshe gets down, dirty and truly\nfunky with this stunner of a track, which sweats optimism\nand avoids unwanted lyrical\nfussing, every word adding\nanother element of cadence. The\nwith Jack Allsopp, like Mike\nSkinner, \"speaking poetry\", some\nmay say MC-ing, but I think not.\nA very upbeat tune, the album\nsounds promising so far. The next\ntune is deeper, darker, with more\npunch, Jack sounding like Maxi\nJazz and saying his lyrics to a nice bit of music. The middle of\nthe album remains deep, meticulous, easily fading into the back-ground, a slow burner of an\nalbum, and Sammy D features on\nEye To Eye. Contradictions is next\nup, apace i er tune, funky guitar,\nbut now with similarities to Ian\nBrown with the lack of effort in\nthe vocals.\nThe lack of effort in the vocals\nwas just for a single tune though\nas Snapshot memories progresses sounding more like Air, with\nthe tune playing with a lot of electric synthesisers and samples.\n7r/ p/e Tone Eyes is faster, being\ndrum and bass, melodic but\ngloomy, not as upbeat as earlier.\nsecond single Word Love echoes\nall the great soul sisters of note,\ne.g. Beverley Knight and Aretha\nFranklin with its high-pitched\nvocals and seventies backing\nrhythm. \"Sometimes the word\nlove/ Just ain't good enough/To\ndescribe this I feel for you\".\nLikewise, Damn is a jazzy, sassy,\nuptempo, soulful delight, about\nnewly found single dom( go\nRhianna!) with a hint of RnB\nand the Stevie Wonder cover, /\nLove Every Little Thing About\nYou does justice to the original.\nAnother highlight, is the jazz-funk pop-masterpiece of Moon is\nBlue, which brings the vibe\ndown with a suitably understated sexiness and cut-to-pieces\nbeat. Unfortunately, the album\ndoes have its duff tracks, in the\nshape of the overtly socially-conscious Runaway, and the disgustingly soppy Romeo and\nJuliet. (As you've learnt before,\n3/5\nThe album rounds off with a slower tune Ain't Too Sad, nothing\nthat will have you singing praises\nbut a thoughtful song non the\nless. Although a well thought\nalbum with stimulating areas, an\nalbum that none the less sounds\nlike it bears heavily on other creative influences that are the original pioneers of this sound.\nToby B REVIEWERS REQUIRED\nNo experience necessary. We\nreview gigs, albums and singles\nof as many different types of\nmusic as we can get our hands\non. You also get to keep whatever you review.\nCome to Felix in Beit Quad on\nThursdays at 1.30pm or email\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk and we'll\nsee if you can do better than us!\n4/5\nthis writer has a thing against\nsoppy pieces of music, having\nnot needed them in a long, long\ntime. She is, as we speak, perfectly single. No supplementary\nreasons needed to explain why\nshe enjoys drinking and bitching\nabout being single with best\nmate).\nIt's hard to believe Rhianna is\nonly nineteen, having produced\nsuch an accomplished debut\nalbum. I sincerely hope that she\nkeeps up the good work, for producing one of the best pop\nalbums of the year, and that she\nhas the efficacy to turn it into an\nentertaining live show - she is\nperforming on tour with Beverley\nKnight in December.\nThis album deserves to do\nwell on a mainstream level and\nis a stylish effort deserving of\nmass recognition. Go and buy it\nnow!\nSajini\nSingles\nMcAlmont and Butler - Bring It\nBack\nThe maestro has his turn, with\nthe acoustic squiggles, maraca\nshakes and gospel intro. This provides the perfect backdrop for\nDavid McAlmont's breathy, stunning and rich vocals to take the\nsimple, yet effective lyrics to the\nhighest peaks showing the band\nas velvety, romantic, loving, pure\nsoul in the days of electronica\nand alternative. Who cares if it\nsounds old fashioned in most of\nthe songs? I don't. Likeable to\nanyone and everyone, accessible,\nwell-crafted, melodic and fun,\nthis is how pop should be.\n5/5\nSajini\nBig-Brovaz - Nu Flow\nThis is the South London\ngarage/rn b group's first single. It's an encouraging debut which has\na circus feel to it while still maintaining the urban beats. Lyrically\nthey're talking about how they're\ngonna take over the music indus-try, introduce themselves and\ndissing the hater z. Usual subject\nmatter. Nonetheless catchy.\n4/5\nOscar\nCompetition Time!\nAlabama 3 have donated a; copy of their new album\nfor you lucky readers.\nAll you have to do is:\nanswer this very simple'\nquestion and email your\nanswer to\nmusic. felix@ic. ac. uk\nby Thursday 17th October\nWhich artist recorded the:\nlegendary Sweet Home\nAlabama?\na) Lynyrd Skynyrd\nb) Alabama 3\nGood Luck!\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material\nprovided by man's senses) is man's only means of perceiving reality,\nhis only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic\nmeans of survival.\n3. Man \u2014 every man \u2014 is an end in himself, not the means to the ends\nof others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to\nothers nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational\nself-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of\nhis life.\n4. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a system where men deal with one another, not as victims and\nexecutioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free,\nvoluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may\nobtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no\nman may initiate the use of physical force against others. The\ngovernment acts only as a policeman that protects man's rights; it uses\nphysical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its\nuse, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of full\ncapitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for\nthe same reasons as the separation of state and church.\nNovelist-Philosopher Ayn Rand\nThe United Kingdom Objectivist Association, P.O.

    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS11 Albums & Singles\nThe Music\nThe Music5/5* l1 The Music certainly chose a name to live up to - a name that\nsuggests complete control of\nmelody, harmony, rhythm and\ntimbre - and live up to it they\nhave. If an alien came to earth\ntoday, walked up to me and said\n'explain music', I'd just give it\nthis album. Dirty, rolling guitar\nriffs, bouncy drum beats and a gruff yet interestingly charming\nlead vocal make these four\nLeeds boys into something\namazing. Add in rock, jazz and\nindie influences (can you say\ns ke bop-a doodle?) and it's just... mind blowing. The Music got together on the\npremise that there was 'now t else to do', and started touring\njust over a year ago when they\nfinished school. They've been on\nthe road almost constantly\nsince. They've supported The\nCharlatans, New Order, The\nDoves and Oasis - pretty hard\nacts to warm up for - and have\nbeen loved at every single gig.\nSo what have they got that all\nthose other new bands don't? Energy. Life. A passion for\nmusic. Every single member of\nThe Music is completely\nobsessed with what they're\ndoing - making music to entertain and help people. Making\npeople happy! Oh, and they\nhave a really pretty sleeve for\ntheir album. Circles! Rainbow!\nWoo! The People and Take The\nLong Road And Walk It were\nboth previously released as EPs,\nand they're probably the best\ntracks on the album. Both are\nbouncy, fun, yet really rocky\ntracks with old-school noises\nand delicate harmonies sprinkled throughout. Think distortion and lots of it. Think bouncing around like a crazed lunatic.\nThink tart ra zine and sugar rush.\nThink guitar music you can\ndance to, and think how cool\nthat is!\nDisco and The Dance, both\nlive favourites, have come out\nreally well on record. They still\ncontain most of the energy of the\nlive performance although to\nreally appreciate The Music\nyou'll have to go out of your way\nto see them live. Which should-n't be a problem, considering\nhow much they tour.\nBut enough of me rambling\non! Quick, go out and buy this\nalbum, then have a party and\nturn it on and turn it up. Watch\npeople dance. And dance your-self. And then go to bed and\nconsider it a job well done. After\nall, you probably have lectures\ntomorrow morning.\nJess\nThe Crescent 3/5\nThe Crescent The Crescent are another product of Liverpool, but are they\nworthy of all the attention?\nAdmittedly, it's unfortunate for\nThe Crescent that they, along\nwith The Music and The Coral\nhave been met with so much\nhype and expectation.\nAs seen many a time before,\nthe consequence of hype is that\na band very rarely delivers; people expect too much and are\nusually disappointed. This\nreviewer decided to ignore it all,\nand listen to The Crescent for\ntheir own merits.\nWith so many bands now a days, you hear a bit of everything in the Crescent. Maybe,\nit's just the accents, but I can\nhear many acclaimed Scousers\namong them; The Beatles, the\nLa's and Cast.\nThe Beatles connection goes a little further, as the band insisted that they used studio 2 at the\nAbbey Road recording studios in\nwhich The Beatles played.\nAnother heavy influence is\nthat from North-West neighbours Oasis; as it could be said\nThe Crescent have produced the\nalbum that Oasis should have\ndone after What's the Story\nMorning Glory.\nThe strong point of this album\nis that The Crescent don't pretend to be anything they're not,\nand that is a good raw melodic\nrock band. The songs on this\nalbum are well crafted and\nsometimes hippy-ish, like the\nopening track On the Run which\nsets the style and pace for the\nentire album.\nThe highlight, or low light, take\nit as you please, is the sound-alike of Paul Weller and the\nLevellers, especially on top summertime sing-along, Streets of\nTide.\nIt's best not to expect the\ngreatest things from The\nCrescent just at the moment,\nbut what you can expect is\nmusic that you can turn up really loud and annoy the neighbours with.\nSajini\nSingles\nJJ72 - Formulae\nYay! JJ72 return from the\ndepths of the recording studio\nwith more twin k ly guitar ed, falsetto-vo called madness. Or\nnot madness, as it were, but in\nfact a very well-structured\npiece of music. The haunting\ntones of Mark Greaney and his\nechoing guitars make JJ72\nwhat they are - an indie-pop\nband to be revered and loved.\nYes, boys and girls, they're still\ncool!\nFormulae is no exception\nand plus as well* it has good\nlyrics that you can really, you\nknow, relate to. In a cool, emo\nhip kind of way.\nThey're not goth, you know.\n5/5\nFrou Frou - Must Be Dreaming\nTwo-piece Frou Frou first\ncame to the attention of the\npublic this summer with their\ndelicate dance hit Breathe In,\nand Must Be Dreaming is just\nmore of the same. At first it\nsounds a little like Craig David\nis about to burst into song\n(leaving you cringing just in\ncase), but as soon as Imogene\nstarts to sing this song is com\np let ely amazing. It positively\noozes sexy, breathy vocals and\nintricate guitar and drum work.\nTake a listen before you rush\nout and buy it though, as it may\nnot be everyone's cup of tea.\n3/5\nJess\nFeeder - Come Back Around\nBands are a bit like people, you\nknow. Some you hate, some\nyou love. Some always seem to\nbe the life and soul of the party,\nwhile others are just... there.\nFeeder are the quiet kid with\nthe guitar in their bedroom\nwho gets a bit hyper and\nobnoxious when they get drunk\n(continued on page 12)\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

I may not really be your\narchetypal club ber but then that didn't seem\nto matter here, as everyone was welcome.\nSystem is a pretty new night - I went to the\nfifth one of the series - but it's fast establishing\nitself as one of the capital's most exciting club\nevents. Apparently, according to 'my mate'\n(who knows lots more than me), the music\nwas 'hard house / techno, without being committed as much to true innovation as real tech-no'. I can't really say a lot more than that;\n(although the resident DJ pulled off some truly\nexhilarating shit) except to say that I had an\namazing time, and danced my legs off.\nTrue, the night was a little on the slow side\n- but we'll put that down it's youth and the fact\nthat I went in Freshers' Week.

This was the\nroom to go to chill, with its very comfy sofas\nmaking the perfect place for a drink and con-versa tion. I checked out the R'n' B room, and it was a let down - it just had blok es lining the edge of\nthe dancefloor and very few people actually\ndancing. Luckily the UK Garage room was\nmuch better. Andy Lewis played some decent\ntunes like Sticky's Boo and the remix of Shoala\nAma's Imagine. Thankfully the main R'n' B room definitely picked up later with a set from\ntwice Mobo winner, Steve Sutherland.\nThe clientele was disappointing. It seemed,\noddly, teenage, and everyone had an attitude.\nYes, the girls were looking good, but they all\nseemed very bitchy. The music made up for it\nthough. An okay night out.

    "content": "FELIX SOCIETIES Q9^'{ f^g Downhill Racing Following a successful trip last year, the I.C. Cycling club planned to revisit the French Alps\nthis summer for some serious downhill mountain biking. Last year we found that the 'Portes\nDu Soleil' region was ideal for what we were\nlooking for; plentiful chairlifts giving access to\nup to 900 vertical metre runs of extreme\ndownhill courses and trails!\nUpon our arrival at Geneva Airport the eight\nof us were greeted by worse weather than\nback home: pissing rain! This didn't put us off\nthough and after unpacking and assembling\nour bikes on Sunday morning a few of us went\nout riding. The next day the rain was replaced\nwith sun and rather than ride the local course\nwe elected to go into Switzerland using the\nnetwork of ski lifts. An excellent days riding\nwas had, taking in fast rocky fire roads, some\nhuge courses and technical back trails. On the\nWednesday we went from Morzine over to Les\nGets in the next valley to session the World\nCup course. More rain had turned the course\ninto a quagmire in places which meant that\nmany spent more time on their asses than on\ntheir bikes!\nThursday was an eventful day which didn't go to plan right from the start. We had intended to go back to Switzerland but as we were\ngetting close we saw that the weather in that\nvalley was bad. We headed back to Morzine to\nride the local 'Avalanche Cup' course and\nfound the weather back there to be fine and\nsunny! This course was a favourite with plenty of braking bumps, insanely steep sections,\nmuddy root y wooded bits and huge ski jumps!\nOn my second run of the afternoon I made all\nthe difficult sections of the course but crashed\non a fast section at the bottom, going over the\nbars. Pretty soon my arm seized up so I went\nback to the chalet. Later on myself and Rob\ndecided we should go to the doctor to get our\ninjuries checked out, very kindly the owner of\nthe chalet next door offered a lift. We were\nslightly concerned when we discovered she\nwas on first name terms with the doctors! We\nboth received the news we didn't want to hear,\nme that I'd cracked my arm and Rob the s caff oid in his hand. That was undoubtedly the\nunluckiest day of the holiday!\nFor the remaining week or so of the holiday\nthe guys who hadn't broken themselves or\ntheir bikes continued to get loads of riding in\nwhile also taking advantage of the cool local\nnightlife, with plenty of clubs to choose from.\nEven though there were less people around as\nthere would be during the ski season there\nwas always one packed club. The music was\nan oddity, within one night varying from RATM\nto crazy German-folk-music-style dance and\nreggae, but with very similar sets from club to\nclub. Excellent entertainment though, especially after sharing a few 'giraffes' (5 pints of\nbeer in a tall container with a tap) in the\nBuddha bar. We were such valued customers\nwe received a couple of rounds of flaming\nsam bu cas on the house!\nOverall the 2002 trip was a great success,\nwith everyone agreeing that the riding the\nhuge courses improved their skills and technique greatly. Although the weather could\nhave been better we definitely improved our\nMonopoly and Risk tactics, also fitting in a game of tequila/Jack Daniels Uno! We will be\nback next year...\nStephen Wallis\nr\\i \u2022 r\\n i Public Service Announcement Insurance for Clubs and Societies Activities\nYou may have heard some talk within your societies of the need to get something called an \"Activities Card\" from the Union. This especially\nused to apply to sporting and recreational clubs. The Union used to offer a level of personal accident insurance through this scheme, which is\nvery useful if you get injured playing sport or taking part in other club activity organised by the Union.\nThe problem with this system was that it was hard to enforce, hard to administer, and generally more headaches than the other alternatives. So\nfor the sake of less hassle, and more time to actually do the stuff that you want to do with your clubs and societies, we've gotten rid of that idea!\nSo are you insured now?\nYes!\nProvided:\n\u2022You are a registered member of any club or society within the Union, which means you must have filled in a membership form for the club\nwho's activities you are participating in.\n\u2022You fill in an accident form (available in the Union Offices, Beit Quad) as soon as possible following your accident.\n\u2022The activity you are taking part in is organised by a club or society of Imperial College Union, for which the proper documentation has been\nfilled in, eg. Trip Registration Forms - check with the organiser if there is any doubt!\nThe Union has centrally organised accident cover for all of our members, provided they are participating in our activities. This cost has been\npaid for centrally, and will not be passed on to members, or clubs and societies.\nSam Sharpe\nStudent Activities Assistant\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "COLUMN FELIX By Students, For Students\nIn 1999, Imperial College entered\ninto a strategic alliance with four\nof the best science and technological institutes from across Europe\nto form the IDEA' league. The\nleague consists of Imperial\nCollege, Delft University of\nTechnology, ETH Zurich and\nRWTH Aachen. This is symptomatic of the globalisation of education and over the coming years\nyou are likely to see more\nalliances formed not only in\nEurope but across the world.\nThe Students' Unions of the\nrespective Universities have also\nformed a strategic partnership to\nensure the views of students are\nheard within the IDEA league. We\nhad our first conference in May.\nOne of the key issues that was\ndebated at the conference was\nthe Bologna Declaration. The declaration was signed by Ministers\nof Education from 32 European\ncountries including the United\nKingdom and in itself is quite a complex and intricate document.\nIn essence the declaration is a commitment between the countries to reform the structures of\ntheir higher education systems in\na convergent way. It aims to create a comparable and increasingly converged system of graduate\nand post-graduate\neducation across\nEurope, in order to\nmaximize transfer-ability and mobility within Europe.\nOne of the key objectives is the\nadoption of a system of easily\nreadable and comparable\ndegrees. This will essentially be\nbased on two main cycles, undergraduate and graduate. It will also\nlook towards establishing a system of credits that can be used\nbetween the countries signing up\nto the Bologna Declaration. This\nwill allow for the free movement\nof students across Europe.\nIn principle this sounds great\nbut the practicalities can have a great impact on students here.\nThe proposed model for adoption\nis a three year undergraduate programme (e.g. BEng), followed by\na two year masters (e.g. MSc)\nand a three year post-graduate\nstudies (PhD). As\nyou can imagine\nthis clashes with\nour four year\nundergraduate\nmasters degree and the one year\nmasters programme. One immediate impact would be funding.\nCurrently the government is\ncommitted to funding the first\ndegree for students. If you wish to\nundertake a second degree you\nare obliged to pay a fee that\nvaries from institution to in st it u tion. Luckily, an integrated masters degree is regarded as you first\ndegree and as such funded by the\ngovernment. If Imperial followed\nthe Bologna process split it\ndegree into the 3:2 format, students would have to find ways of\nfunding the extra years and add to\nexisting pressures on student\nfinances.\nIt would also have implication\non quality assurance - such as\nhaving to fill out a two year masters degree. These issues and\nmore besides will have affect the\nfuture of higher education institutions in this country.\nImperial College will have to\nengage in a debate on whether we\nwill be following the principles of\nthe declaration or go our own\nway.\nThis is likely to start over the\nnext few months and it is important that the students participate\nto ensure that best decisions are\ntaken for all concerned.\nSen Ganesh\nPresident\nEurope\nHello, chums. What a good wheeze it was to\nget up early today instead of staying up late. I may actually have succeeded in getting my\nbody clock back to some level of normality by,\nget this, enforcing a wake up time of 6am!I am\npretty impressed with that, since the night\nbefore last I only went to bed a4 am. So in one\nfell swoop (and losing only minimal amounts of\nsleep) I have put myself back on track with the\nrest of the world: up with the lark, etc.\nInterestingly, I have to admit that it wasn't as\nunpleasant as I thought it would be. Very much\nin the same way as I had a coconut freeze at\nWagamamas last night, did I discover that my\naversion was in fact entirely mental as opposed\nto physical.\nMy point? Well, this is actually a life changing thing for me (not the coconut, incidentally),\nsince I had made the decision that I was never\ngoing to get a nine to five job because I could-n't bear the concept of a) getting up early, and\nb) rush hour traffic.\nSo how has this all changed? Well, I actually\nthink I wouldn't mind getting up so early now:\nit actually feels quite nice to be up and about\nand know that the whole day lies ahead of you,\nas opposed to getting up in time for lunch, and\nthen having to work all afternoon and evening,\npacking in some drinks when you've got the\ntime, and then back to the old grind for a couple of hours until dawn! Sorry, I think I'm rant-ing, but frankly I'm not used to feeling this\nawake.\nAnd secondly I was talking to a friend the\nother day about his job, and he works in the\nopposite direction to rush hour, so he occasionally bumps into crowds going the other way at\nrailway stations and stuff, but for the most part\nhis entire journey is stress free.\nBasically what I'm saying is that I'm going to\npack it all in and become an investment banker.\nI never wanted to be a lumberjack anyway. No,\nbut seriously, I wouldn't give up Felix just yet:\nafter all you don't get free accommodation in\nSouth Ken even if you do work at Accenture,\nbut my mother, and you, my dear dear friends,\nmay be glad to hear that I'm not going to be a slacker all my life. Having said this, my father\nrecently found the telephone number of a woman who runs a turtle sanctuary in Malaysia\n(I'm determined to look after turtles for at least\na couple of months out of my whole life. No, I don't know why), so maybe this temporary\ninsanity is indeed only temporary, and I will\nwake up tomorrow morning (probably after having fiddled with my computer till 4am) or afternoon having decided that yes indeed I do still\nwant to be a professional slacker and to be honest I don't know many better than I). Which brings me to what I wanted to talk\nabout this week, which is jobs. Depressing as it\nis, final year students should now be thinking\nabout what they are going to do with the rest of\ntheir lives, and yes, that does sadly include me.\nSo go on, get out there, guys.\nSorry that was a bit weak, but I'm really not\nused to being up this early.\nPS. Felix is now using a new printing com-p any, just so you know.\nwill\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

The annoyances section deals with simple problems\nwhile also allowing you to filter those that are\nnot applicable to your edition of Windows,\nsuch as turning off CD-ROM auto run and stopping annoying programs that open automatically every start up. The troubleshooting section deals with more complex problems such\nas trying to get DOS games working and\nupgrading the mother (ship) board (sorry,\ncouldn't resist).\nThe other side to this site is the humour sec-tion, some of which is really very funny and\nmost of which is anti-Windows, they are sent in\nby site users so join in if you wish. One my\nfavourites is a take-off of The Raven by Edgar\nAllen Poe, entitled 'Abort, Retry, Ignore?' it is\nvery cleverly done and amusing too.

For those\nof you have no idea (though I imagine most of\nyou do) what I'm talking about Dilbert is a comic strip that was launched in 1989.\nDilbert is an over zealous engineer with a passion for random gadgets and gizmos and a total inability to interact socially. His closest\ncompanion is Dogbert. Dogbert is an individual of the canine variety with the ability to\ntalk, he is very cynical and sarcastic and\ndoesn't mind sharing it. These are the two\nmain characters there is also his boss, a master at being the world's least liked human\nbeing and his co workers who seem to suffer\nfrom a severe case of clinical stupidity.\nIt is a misplaced belief that you have to be\na computer geek to understand Dilbert and\nhis work mates, whereas in fact anyone who\nhas ever had to deal with anyone else ever is\nlikely to find something that they can associate with.\nAnyway, this website has many of his cartoon strips with the option of having a comic\nstrip emailed daily to you. There are games, e cards, Dilbert character cursors/ wallpaper/\nscreen savers as well as introductory information on the characters, news and history.\nI enjoyed spending time browsing through\nthe archive of comic strips that goes back one\nmonth. The subscription page for daily Dilbert\nis a little daunting ly large considering it is just\nfor a cartoon but you don't have to fill most of\nit in.

    "content": "FELIX OPINION05 And Alex Said...\nFresh! Aaah! Wake up in the\nmorning in those crisp, clean\nsheets, open the window and\nbreathe in a lung ful of fresh\ncountry air. Brush your teeth\nwith that minty toothpaste, full\nof freshness. Freshen up with a nice shower. Refresh yourself\nwith a glass of orange juice and\nsome toast. Fresh! Yes! Fresh is\nclean and sweet-smelling and\nfull of energy and lovely.\nSomething of a mystery, then,\nwhy new university students are\ncalled \"Freshers\". If there were a group of people less clean and\nsweet-smelling than students, I really wouldn't want them near\nme while I was trying to eat.\nBy now most fresher s should\nhave realised why they don't show you round halls of residence on university open days.\nGoing to university is great, but\nfor all that new-found independence, you've got to sacrifice a few things. Things like basic\nhygiene, for instance. Decent\ncooking, for another. Furniture\nmanufactured since 1978.\nAt home, you can leave crockery near the sink and, in a few\nhours, it's gone. If you want a cup of coffee,\nget a mug out\nof the cup-board. Grab a spoon from the\ndrawer. Make it. Simple. Nice.\nAt university, if you want a cup\nof coffee, run your mug under the\ntap and scrape the congealed\nstuff from the spoon. Put the\ndirty, wet spoon in the coffee jar\nand then the sugar jar, and then\nwonder why all your coffee granules have turned into one huge,\njar-sized mass, and why your\nFilth!\nsugar has brown lumps in it.\nYou can just about put up with\nthat for your year in halls. But in\nyour second year it gets worse.\nIn your own flat, at least now you\nknow whose hair that is in the\nshower, but if you leave it there\nfor 24 hours, it doesn't magically\ngo away - somebody has got to\nclean it up.\nProbably you.\nStudents\noften go into\ntheir second\nyear and forget that cleaning is\nsomething that needs to be done\nmore than once every six weeks.\nWhen it gets to this stage, you\ncan forget about cleaning the\nbathroom with a cloth - you'll\nneed a chisel.\nIt's a lot simpler to just clean\nup more regularly. But try telling\nthat to your fellow students. You\ncould draw up a rota, but you\nknow even before you write it\nthat they will read it as avidly as\nthe latest update to your\nBarclaycard Terms and\nConditions, and with about as\nmuch enthusiasm as, well,\ncleaning the toilet. And if you're\nlucky, it will be kept to just as\naccurately as a typical bus\ntimetable, i.e. with absolutely no\ncorrelation whatsoever between\nwho's supposed to be doing the\ncleaning, and who's there with a scrubbing brush.\nNo, the only sensible solution\nis just to live with it. Brace your-self, lower your standards and\nget on with it. Sit down in your\nrickety wooden chair, open wide\nand swallow a mouthful of whatever is parasite of the day. It's good for the immune system.\nAlex Warren\nT You could say my degree\nisn't relevant for a career\nin Investment Banking,\nor you could find\nout the truth.\nGRADUATE PRESENTATION\nInvestment Banking\nIf you think having a top Economics or Finance degree is\nthe only way into JPMorgan, think again.

    "content": "1 2 MUSIC REVIEWS FELIX Interview of the Week\nTOP LOADER So why do you think people hate\nyou all so much?\nI think that really we're an easy\ntarget basically aren't we. The\npeople that do hate us are them\n(points to copy of NME in front of\nus) but they'll slag anyone off\nreally. I mean they'll slag\nRadiohead off next week and they\ngave them the cover this week.\nOverall I think that they don't like\nthe fact that we have a lot of fun.\nThat and the Dancing in the\nmoonlight thing. It's a shame\nreally cos to us that's what life's about-About not taking things too\nseriously. At the end of the day we\ndo the same job as every other\nband-there's nothing we do really\nany different from day to day, only\nwe have more of a laugh with it\nprobably.\nDoes it not bother you though?\nYou can't let it. You just have to\nget on with it. Everyone's entitled\nto their opinion so there's nothing\nyou can do to change their op in ion. If they started shooting us\nthen....you know sticks and\nstones etc.\nAre there any bands that you've\never really hated?\nNot really because I understand\nthe fact that everyone's trying to\nmake music first and foremost\nand to therefore make a living and\neveryone's entitled to do that. I mean obviously the pop thing's annoying but again it's just marketing people. I think as soon as\nthe industry machine takes over\ntoo much and it becomes too\napparent that you're not listening\nto someone's music any more but\nthat you're listening to a corpora-tion's idea of what music is, then\nmusic becomes shallow and soulless but we get accused of that\nand I think that's the only thing\nthat upsets us, because we do\nhave a lot of integrity and we\nbelieve in the music and likewise\nwe do make throwaway pop from\ntime to time.\nDoes it not bother you though\nthat your most popular song is\nbasically a cover and not your\nown?\nNo not at all. I mean the\nBeatles did Roll Over Beethoven,\nthe stones played loads of covers\ntoo. We've not done a faithful version of the song we've bought it\nup to date and made it more\ninteresting.\nWhy did you play at the\njubilee. Are you pro-monarchy?\nThe jubilee thing was probably\nshown to the whole of the commonwealth and probably a billion\nFelix spoke to\nJulian from\nToploader\nabout life in\nBritain's most\nhated band.\nSajini\nWijetilleka\nviewers so we wanted to do it on\nthat basis. And it was a really\ngreat day. We do things which\naren't perhaps cool but by doing\nthat day we had one of the days\nof our lives and it's something I 'll\nnever forget. It wasn't about the\ncause. I don't want to decapitate\nthe monarchy but I think if some\nold bint's been head of state of\nthis country for god knows how\nlong, if she can't have a party and\nmake a big deal out of it then it\nseems a shame.\nWhat would make Toploader split\nup?\nIf someone fucked someone\nelse's girlfriend or wife then that\nmight do it. We get on pretty well.\nWe fight when we're in the creative process but I think that's healthy. When we go on tour it's very rare that we have arguments.\nDo you ever see older bands like\nGuns 'n Roses and the Stones\nand think that it's about time\nthat they actually call it a day?\nWell I used to but I can understand now why they carry on\ndoing it. The thought of going\nback to all our old jobs is not that\nappealing. So yeah, I can completely understand why, say, The\nCure are still going on.\nSajini\nSingles\n(continued from page 11)\nStill, it's hard to totally loathe\nthem - after all don't we all get\na bit annoying from time to\ntime when we're drunk?\nOf course, you want to know\nabout the record, I probably\ndigress s too much. Sorry chum\n- there isn't much to say. It's a single taken from the Comfort\nIn Sound LP. It's a scientifically-proven 3:12 long. The song-writing, arrangement and production are up to the usual high\nFeeder standard. And yes: you\nwill find your feet at appin' just\na little bit. But as a band, it\nseems Feeder really have nothing to say anymore. So neither!\ndo I.3/5 Suede - Positivity\nJess]\nIt's hard to tell if anyone still\nremembers Suede, the Third\nBand of Britpop. They weren't as catchy as Blur, or as noisy as\nOasis. But you always suspected that if anyone really cared\nabout their songs, it was\nSuede. On the basis of this\nrecord, that's still the case.\nOne of the most appealing\nthings about them was Brett\nAnderson's vocals; at once\nsneering and fragile, humble,\neven. That's true here, in couplets like \"Your smile is your\ncredit card / Your currency is\nyour love.\" Ambivalent lyrics,\ndelicately sung - suggesting a man balancing between the\ngood life he's won but trying to\nhold on to some youthful vitriol\nat the same time.\nIt's not a sentiment that most\nof the kids will get, and neither\nwill they appreciate this song: a leisurely autumn stroll around a leafy North London park, rather j than the edgy Soho strut of\nolder Suede classics like\nFilmstar. But why should the|\nkids have all the fun?\n4/5\nJoe Parker\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

Imperial\ngoes mountain mad.\nPage 9\nUnions Vote on Strike The Association of University Teachers is one of\nseveral unions to announce a strike ballot, due\nto take place by the end of the month.\nBallot papers were due to be sent out yesterday to AUT members to decide whether to\nwalk out over the current level 'London\nallowance' - the extra money awarded to staff\nfor increased living costs in the capital. At the\nmoment, staff receive an allowance of \u00a32134\nevery year but this has remained frozen since\n1992. The AUT are campaigning for an\nallowance of over \u00a34000, and have decided to\nbegin industrial action due to the \"in trans i gence of employers\" in negotiations. The\nunions note that the average salary of Vice\nChancellors is \u00a316000 greater in London than\noutside, and feel that less senior staff are being\ntreated unfairly.\nThe University of London [Students'] Union\nhas been campaigning for an increase to the\nstudent London allowance for some time, and\ndecided to back the action by university staff at\nThe generic 'ballot picture'\nthe ULU Council meeting held last week. The\nImperial College student delegation to the\nmeeting voted against support of a staff strike,\nthough two of the IC delegates voted in favour.\nDespite the vote, Sen Ganesh, President of\nImperial College Union said he was \"deeply\nconcerned about the situation\", stating that\nstrike action would have a significant impact\non Union services if staff were to join in the\nstrike action.\nAt the end of 2001, Imperial College raised\nthe starting salaries of new lecturers by\n\u00a38000, which has been seized by staff unions\nas an indication of the recruitment crisis in\nLondon and further evidence of the need to\nimprove pay. Staff employed after 1992 were\nrecently offered an allowance increase of just\nunder 3% but this was unanimously rejected\nby the trade unions.\nThe strike ballots close at the end of October,\nand, if approved, industrial action will take\nplace on Thursday 14th November.\nThe result of the ballot, and headway made\nby staff as a result of any action, will be carefully watched by student unions and may pave\nthe way to improvements in allowances awarded to students living in London.

After this it was (very) freely adapted\nand extended to give the five books that\nmake up the trilogy: The Hitchhiker's Guide\nto the Galaxy; The Restaurant at the End of\nthe Universe; Life, the Universe and\nEverything; So Long and Thanks for All the\nFish; Mostly Harmless. Some of it has also\nbeen made into a television show some time\nago.\nNow I would claim that these are the best\nset of books ever written, I 've read them\nmany times, I 've listened to the radio show\nand although I have yet to see the TV show I would claim to be one of his greatest fans\n(never thought I'd say that about anyone). As\nsuch I very highly recommend that any sad\nindividual out there who has still to be introduced to the wonders of the world of Douglas\nAdams buys these books. I say 'buy' because\nyou can never read these too many times, a worthwhile investment if you enjoy reading,\nand even (or maybe especially) if you don't. The series begins with Arthur Dent, a hangover and a big yellow bulldozer. Arthur's hangover means it takes him a little time to\nremember that the big yellow bulldozer is\nthere to knock his house down. This is\nbecause the council wish to build a bypass\nand neglected to tell Arthur. Well, they say\nthe plans have been there for months but\nthis doesn't exactly go down well.\n'\"You haven't exactly gone out of your way\nto call attention to them had you? I mean like\nactually telling anyone or anything.'\n'But the plans were on display.'\n'On display? I eventually had to go down to\nthe cellar to find them.'\n'That's the display department.'\n'With a torch.'\n'Ah, well the lights had probably gone.'\n'So had the stairs.'\n'But, look, you found the notice didn't you.'\n'Yes,' said Arthur, 'yes, I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet\nin a disused lavatory with a sign on the door\nsaying Beware of The Leopard.'\"\nHaving started the day losing his house\nArthur doesn't think it can get much worse\nbut soon discovers that his best friend,\ninconspicuously named Ford Prefect, is actually from another planet and not only is his\nhouse being demolished for a bypass but\ntoday is also the day that the Earth will be\ndemolished for a hyperspace bypass. All in\nall it is a pretty bad Thursday.\nHowever, Arthur is actually quite lucky\n(although he might not believe it) because\nFord manages to hitch a lift with the space\nship that is about to destroy Earth thanks to\nsome helpful domestic workers. From there\nthey are thrown out by the not-very-friendly\nowners of the vehicle with which they\nhitched a lift and picked up by the most\nadvanced, intelligent ship ever invented -The Heart of Gold. Here they meet the only\nother surviving member of the human race\nTricia McMillan, or Trillian, and Zaphod\nBeeblebrox, President of the Galaxy. From\nhere on in the trilogy follows the adventures\nand misadventures of these four as they\nhitchhike around the universe and through\ntime in a desperate bid to stay alive. The\nunlucky foursome stumbles from one disaster\nto another involving various alien life forms\nnone of which seem to be very friendly.\nNow, as yet, I haven't mentioned the best,\nmost popular character - Marvin the\nParanoid Android. A robot with an intellect\nbeyond the comprehension of us mere mortals he is also the most depressed individual\nthe Universe has ever seen. He is forced to\ndo menial tasks and makes sure that everyone is clear that he hates doing them. With\na pain in all the diodes down his left-hand\nside he moans, grumbles, w hinges and complains his way through the entire series.\nDouglas Adams in fact tried to write him out\nat one point but there was such uproar from\nMarvin fans that he was quickly resurrected\nin the next book.\nDouglas Adams is also responsible for the\ncreation of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective\nAgency and The Long Dark Teatime of the\nSoul. He has also written in conjunction with\nMark Carwardine (Last Chance To See), John\nLloyd (The Deeper Meaning of Lift) and Terry\nJones (Starship Titanic). I have read Starship\nTitanic and would definitely recommend it\nand the Dirk Gently books are also well\nworth a read, but The Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy remains my firm favourite. So go! BUY\nBUY BUY! (Doesn't that word look weird\nwhen you repeat it?)\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is\navailable at all good bookshops.\nJenny\nbooks.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"
