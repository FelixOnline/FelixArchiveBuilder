    "content": "WALHABOUTlOOKSii\nby Mobile Optics tac.\nWimbledon and Ascot, grass pollen counts,\ncounty shows and church fe tes, are the\nuniversal constants of an English summer. And\neven if it pours with rain and strawberries cost\na pound a pun net, one summer tradition\nremains unaffected by the weather: the Royal\nAcademy Summer Exhibition which this year\nis supported by IBM United Kingdom Ltd, the\nfirst time in its 215 year history that the\nSummer Exhibition has been backed by\nindustry.\nThe ritual of selection\nJThe toil of months, experience of years\nBefore the dreaded Council now appears'\nSo run the first lines of a pamphlet written by a disappointed painter in 1875.\nIREVIEWSI\nThe exhibition is open to artists of any age\nor nationality, professional or amateur. Most\nmedia are accepted and drawings and\npaintings must be framed and submitted,\nunpacked, in categories (architectural,\nminiatures, prints, etc) on specified days. All\nmust be original and must not previously have\nbeen exhibited in London. This year 5,405\nartists brought their works of art to Burlington\nHouse, to be sent before the 'Selection and\nHanging Committee. Just over 1\n0\n% of the\nworks survived the selection process and the\n1983 exhibition includes an amazing 1,483\nworks, by over 500 artists.\nThe artist members of the Royal Academy\nCouncil who comprise the Committee\nrepresent every facet of aesthetic opinion\u2014a sure recipe for an exhibition inducing visual\nindigestion, one might suppose. Landscapes,\nportraits, pop art and abstraction are all on\nshow, but by exercising care and imagination\nover the hanging, a sense of unity has been\ncreated from wall to wall and gallery to gallery,\nmaking the exhibition both lively and\nenjoyable.\n\u2022Cushion Concerts?' Mahler looks dubious at the Royal Academy\nRoyal Academicians and Amateurs\nStamina is required\u2014unless you visit early on\na weekday morning. The pictures pack the\ngallery walls and the galleries are packed with\nmembers of the public. Large ladies in twin sets and pearls, arty students in rag-trimmed\nJapanese fashions, and smart-blaze red gentlemen who went to the private view for\nserious buyers are there, discussing,\ncriticising, or quietly enjoying themselves.\nWorks by artists of very variable talent hang\nside by side. One of the pleasures of the\nSummer Exhibition is coming upon aspects of\nperfection quite unexpectedly, standing out of\na wall of pedestrian pictures. There are works\nby well known 'names'\u2014an abstract version of\npig-in-the-middle by Victor Pasmore, one of\nPeter Blake's famous 'assemblages', a wonderful bronze sculpture Ijy Joan Miro (an\nHonorary Academician), and drawings by\nLinda Kitson, the Falkland artist. There are\nalso delightful discoveries to be made\u2014the\npeaches and cream skin of William Thomson's nudes, the secret thoughts of Mel Caiman's worried little man, a rose-tinted pointillist e teapot by Lucy Smith, and the fine detail of\nClaire Dalby's postage-stamp-sized wood\nengravings.\nNearly all the works are for sale to the\npublic, at prices varying from \u00a325 to \u00a315,000. if\nmy grant was sufficiently elastic, I should find it\nhard to resist Kaname Konno's 'Goddess of\nthe Sky'. She emerges in luscious curves from\na cabo ch on shape of polished bronze, oozing\nJapanese sensuality to the very tips of her\nexquisite fingers.\nMusic at the Royal Academy\nBetween 2:00 and 4:00pm on Saturdays and\nSundays till July 17, concerts are held by\nstudents of the Royal Academy of Music and\nthe RCM in the courtyard of Burlington\nHouse. In addition, four Youth & Music\nCushion Concerts will be given at the RA,\ntaking place weekly from June 30. The price of\nthe concert ticket includes a private view of\nthe Summer Exhibition, from 6:30pm until you\ngrab a cushion and sit down to listen to the\nmusic at 7:30pm. For further details contact\nthe New Youth & Music Shop at 78 Neal\nStreet, Covent Garden (379 6722).\nWhere? When? \u00a3?\nThe Royal Academy Summer Exhibition is at\nBurlington House, Piccadilly, until August 28\n(closed June 14 and 15). it is open daily,\n10:00am to 6:00pm. The admission is \u00a31 for\nstudents (otherwise \u00a32), except on Mondays\nwhen admission is 50p for everyone, thanks\nto IBM.\nFools and\nTransvestites\nThe Perfect Fool (Hoist) and'The Island of\nTulipatan: A double bill by Imperial\nOpera\nIn The Oxford Dictionary of Music Scholes\ndismissed The Perfect Fool in only seven\nwords: 'Composition of an original and\npersonal character' and despite its rapturous\nreception at its first performance in 1923 it has\nbeen largely ignored since\u2014certainly as a staged opera.\nPerhaps the reason for this is the difficulty of\nknowing at what level to pitch the humour of\nthe piece. Imperial Opera, according to their\nprogramme, believe 'that a spirit of high\ncomedy should be maintained throughout'. If\nthis was indeed their aim, then I feel they failed\nin it; there just isn't enough natural humour in\nthe libretto to do this. In the first twenty\nminutes or so, for example, there is very little\ndialogue at all\u2014certainly not enough to make\ncomedy from.\nNo, Hoist's reputation rests on his abilities\nas a composer, not a humour is t, and it is the\nmusic which makes The Perfect Fool what it is.\nHappily, the singing was strong and confident,\nboth by the soloists and the chorus, and the\norchestra coped admirably with Hoist's technically demanding score under the baton\nof Michael Withers.\nWhere there is opportunity for comedy, the\ncast certainly made the most of it, especially\nwhen the jokes are in the music. Particularly\neffective were Richard Cartmale and Ellis C Pike disputing whether the music should\ndegenerate into a parody of Verdi or Wagner,\nand Deborah Miles-Johnson's facial expressions over her disenchantment with the wizard.\nAnd so to The Island of Tulipatan, a broadly farcical tale of transvestism which\ndoesn't even merit a mention in the Dictionary\nof Music at all.\nHardly surprising, really, since the opera is\ncomplete rubbish\u2014a mishmash of badly\norchestrated tunes accompanying an apology\nfor a plot which makes Gilbert and Sullivan\nappear sophisticated. Nevertheless the opera's shortcomings were more than made up for by\nthe professionalism of the company and Tess\nAlps's crisp production.\nAll five principals gave superb perform-ances, especially Tim Johnson as the grand\nSeneschal (whatever that may be) and Virginia\nKing as his pretentious wife, squeezing laughs\nfrom the most pathetic jokes imaginable. Their\nacting was set off well against the singularly\nslick chorus work. Special mention here must\ngo to Roger Middlebrook who, although only a member of the chorus, was making the most of\nthe opportunities denied him in the title role of\nThe Perfect Fool.\nFinally, congratulations to the company\nwho, in four fully staged light operas, still seem\ndetermined to stay away from the amateur\noperatic's staple diet of Gilbert and Sullivan.\nOne can only wonder what long neglected\nshow they will dig up for their next production.\nWhatever it is, I shall recommend it.\nMartin S Taylor\n\n"

    "content": "EXE C NEWS\nAnnual Report: Silwood Park Committee\nThis academic year has proved to be a very successful one for the Silwood\nPark Committee. Attendances at committee meetings have trebled and\ninvolvement in activities, notably overseas students, has increased generally.\nAs should be obvious the Committee is entirely self-sufficient in providing\nfacilities, and has the capability and necessity of introducing any new activity\nindependently of South Kensington. This is for the benefit of the 100 students\nresident, and the 350 students that visit here from South Ken each year.\nThe total grant received by ICUSPC for 1982/3 was \u00a32,560, with extra\nrevenue from the table football and snooker light machines. Though this was\nan increase on the previous year, it did not go as far, owing to notably the\ninitiation of an Overseas Student Society, which is a new concept at Silwood.\nThis has rapidly increased the involvement of these students from a few, to\nthe majority resident here. It has been the previous scepticism, and hence\ninactivity of these students, which has allowed us to survive on a relatively\nsmall budget in the past.\nUnion Business\n(a) Constitution: There have been major changes this year to update the\norganisation of the Committee for the expected increased in numbers of\nstudents at Silwood and their increased activity. The major change is the\nintroduction of a new Exec Subcommittee for day to day matters.\n(b) Accommodation: The notable success this year, was the removal of any\nresidence subsidy to the refectory. This was important, as most of the\nresidents eat there only as much as the staff, and yet they were the only people\nsub sidi sing it. The result of this was that the effective rent increase was in line\nwith the % grant increase.\nMuch progress has been made in trying to make the standard of the\naccommodation equal, however this has been hindered by attempts from the\nCollege to perfect the new blocks, only for their ceremonial opening at the\nGoverners meeting here in June. A demonstration may be organised against\nthis on the day.\nA great amount of cooperation has been achieved on the Residence\nCommittee to clarify students right and priority to rooms, and the paying of\ndebts etc. This has resulted from a case where a debt in excess of \u00a32,000 was\nallowed to be built up, by the warden, while the College policy will cause this\ndebt to increase the rents, if it is not paid off by the student. A motion passed\nby the Committee objects to this policy.\nStudents involvement in assessing the cost of their residences, and how the\ncost can be kept down, have also been successful.\n(c) Union Equipment: Silwood Park has successfully obtained a Land Rover\nfrom the Exploration Board at IC to cover the recent lack of transport\nfacilities here for students. Though this vehicle was not in wtf nder ful condition on purchase, it is now in good working order and a great asset to\nthe Committee. The students here would prefer a minibus, as the cost of\nrunning a Land Rover and the difficulty in driving it long distances are great. It\nis hoped that the Land Rover would maintain a good resale value if a minibus\nbecame available. A Windsurfer has also been purchased this year.\nSports\nThis area of activities has been very prolific this year even if the array of talent\nis limited. External competitions have been played in football, cricket,\nsnooker, and volleyball. Of these perhaps the snooker has given us greatest\nlocal acclaim. Our football team has a good record against other IC teams.\nOther high participation sports include, tennis, squash, badminton, aerobics,\nkarate, windsurfing. Rugby is starting in the near future.\nGeneral Activities\nAgain the Nat Hist Society has been successful, with a weekend to the Lizard\n(Cornwall) and a weekend to Kent to see most of the British Orchids. Next\nyear it plans to spend a week in Spain.\nThe Film Society has also been an important part of alternative\nentertainment at Silwood and it hopes to incorporate a video section for less\npopular films next year.\nEntertainments of the social nature have also been greatly increased this\nyear, with the notable additions of the first Silwood Park Beer Festival, a Fringe Theatre Musical (the first live theatrical production in living memory\nat Silwood) and numerous parties. A boat trip is planned for later this\nsummer.\nThis has been a great year for ICUSPC, with a greater understanding\nbetween students and staff. With a promise that things can only get better\nfrom the newly elected chairman, activities can only increase, especially\namongst the overseas students. We only hope that ICU will maintain an\ninterest in us.\nI would especially like to thank Chris Endacott, Jeremy Holland, Rosy\nHailes, Mark Hankins, Andy Adams and Prof Way for their help at Silwood\nand Stephen Goulder and Andy Grimshaw without whose interest in Silwood\nthis year would not have been a success.\nAndy Sheppard\nAnnual Report: Recreational Clubs Committee Chairman\nRCC has had a good year, with many of the younger clubs becoming\nestablished and the older clubs carrying on their traditionally high levels of\nactivity. We have continued to cater for a wide variety of activities from the\nlow cost indoor clubs to the higher cost outdoor and flying clubs.\nThe running of RCC has gone as smoothly as ever this year and particular\nthanks for this must go to Frank Potter and Karl Skinner. Frank, as Senior\nTreasurer has always provided gentle advice and support in addition to the\ntask that he shares with Karl, that of finance. This has involved Karl in much\nboring but highly necessary work which he has always done when needed and\nwithout complaint. I would recommend to all branches of ICU that they\nconsider adopting the RCC computer accounting system. This gives a weekly\nreport of individual club finances, eliminates the need for most book-keeping\nby junior treasurers and renders the audit preparation relatively painless.\nTransport is a major item of expense and frustration for many clubs. The\ncentralisation from RCC and ACC to ICU has not provided entirely happy\nresults, although the system has at last been supported by a specific transport\ngrant from ICU.\nThis year I have attempted to give the low-cost high membership clubs a better deal, with Snooker and Wargames Clubs particularly benefitting from\nthis policy. Gliding Club, Balloon Club and other of the higher cost clubs\nhave been traditional targets for attack by some sections of ICU. Part of the\njustification for students unions must be that they provide facilities for\nactivities that would otherwise by prohibitively expensive on a student's income. The number of internationally and nationally known ex-university\nfigures in some of these activities reflects the validity of this argument and I trust that ICU will continue to support these areas.\nI have become firmly of the opinion that the priority expenditure of ICU\nshould be in support of its clubs, whether they be major sub-committee or\nCCU based, provided that they are democratically run and accountable to\ntheir members and ultimately to ICU as the provider of finance. Some clubs,\nparticularly within the CCUs have no real membership, no subscriptions and\nare accountable to nobody but the relevant CCU committee who are in turn\nnot accountable to ICU. It is manifestly wrong and unfair that these bodies\nshould be parasitic on the democratic components of ICU and the CCUs.\nA final word of thanks to all those that have helped me this year: Frank,\nKarl, Mick, Kathey and Chris from RCC, Jen, Jo, Pat, Steve, John and\nChristine from ICU and Ian, Johnathan, Mike and Matthew from the other\nmajor sub-committees. Also my best wishes to all of next year's officers for a successful term of office.\nColin Butter\nSOCIAL COLOURS\nACC\n1 Matthews, Cycling\nT Bell, Pedal GB 83\nD Molesworth, Squash\nJeff Walker, Rugby Tour\nPaul Jarra, Judo Trainer\nJeff Walker, Judo Trainer\nChris Mallaband, ACC Exec, FELIX\nBarry Franklin, ACC Exec\nSarah Pearson, ACC Exec\nMadelaine Spottiswoode, ACC Exec\nDr Dave Chadwick, HST\nWelfare\nN Pyne, many activities\nD G Potter, help this year\nAS Gujral, Nightline\nPub Board\nHugh Southey, AP\nMark Simms, STOIC\nTony Atkins, Phoenix\nNeil Sykes, IC Radio\nNeil Collins, IC Radio\nChristopher Martin, IC Radio\nDavid Walker, IC Radio\nAdrian James, FELIX\nPaul Philippou, FELIX\nLee Paddon, FELIX\nTim Noyce, FELIX\nNick Bedding, FELIX\nDavid Rowe, Phoenix\nPeter Rodgers, Handbook\nSCAB\nAndrew Wood, Orchestra\nMike Withers, Op Soc\nA Moore, Music\nDr DM Edwards, IC Wind Band\nMark Priestly, Dramsoc\nEnts\nD Chaplin, Ents films\nP Belford, Ents Secretary\nG Livett, Ents films\nA Owens, Ents\nS Porter, Ents Treasurer\nA Fasey, Ents disco\nRCC\nDB Ludd, Chess & General\nSarah Jane Smith, Wine Soc\nRichard Williams, Dancing\nSimon Carter, Dancing\nNR Daud, Dancing\nSean Davis, Snooker\nNick Gaskill, Snooker\nPaul Holt, Snooker\nChris Jennings, Snooker\nRichard Barron, Scout & Guide\nJenny Crompton, Scout & Guide\nMichael Harris, Wargames\nKarl Skinner, RCC Vice-Chairman\nBill Pennington, Audio Soc\nSteve Lane, Caving\nMike Bull RCC Hon Sec\nFELIXI I June TO, 19831 IPage7\n\n"

    "content": "Avoiding a Following the C ND issue of FELIX( number 644, May 13) Consoc, quite rightly,\ninsisted on their right of reply and their\nchairman John Pattison arranged for\nFELIX to interview Lady Olga Maitland.\nLady Olga Maitland (Mrs Hay in private\nlife) is married with three children. From\nbeing a face of the 60s, she became the 'Fleet\nStreet hackett e' of the 70s, writing the gossip\ncolumn for the Sunday Express, and is now\nbest known as the founder and voice of the\n'Women for Defence' movement.\nFELIX visited her at home in London Nl\nto discuss her views on unilateral disarmament and civil defence, and to find out more\nabout the 'Women for Defence' movement.\nWe spoke for over an hour, so what follows\nis necessarily a summary of the interview\nWomen for Defence\nFELIX: What prompted you to start the\n'Women for Defence' movement?\nLady Olga Maitland: At the end of last year I began to think more and more about peace\nmovements, and I had a feeling that at\nGreenham Common in particular there'sm of e to it than 20 or 30 lesbian women\nwearing woolly hats.\nYou cannot criticise any movement unless\nyou take the trouble of finding out. So in\nJanuary I spent two days at Greenham\nCommon. I sat round their camp fire and\njust listened. And what was more obvious\nthan anything else what that, first, they were\nmiddle class and educated, and secondly,\nthat they came from all over the country,\ndrawn by this great, almost suffragette\nmovement. And I came to realise that\nwomen together had strength, so that's how\nthe 'women' element got started.\nI totally sym pathis e with their fears\u2014\neveryone should be frightened of a nuclear\nholocaust. But where we are on a totally\ndifferent track is that they have been fed\nwith deliberate misinformation. They are\nalso amazingly and depressingly ignorant.\nThey made statements like 'Cruise is a first\nstrike missile'. Sweeping, emotional\u2014which\nI can understand\u2014but wrong.\nI came back to London and felt that the\nonly way was to form a group, to go out and\nreassure the women of this nation about the\nfacts of the defence issue\u2014why we need to\nbe sensibly and responsibly defended. This\nwas the original intention of 'Women for\nDefence'.\nFrom our first meeting to the launch, on\nthe Tuesday of Holy Week, was only five\nweeks. I knew people would respond so fast\nthat I made a pledge\u2014that on Easter Sunday\nwe would have red tulips on war memorials\nall over the country, laid in memory of those\nwho died in the last war to give us the\nfreedom which we enjoy today. It was\nwonderful, it was moving, but those flowers\nwere laid, from the Channel Islands to\nCaithness, East Anglia, Wales, everywhere.\nWe went on to get a petition signed,\nurging the Russians to positively and\nurgently negotiate for multilateral nuclear\ndisarmament. It was presented at the\nRussian Embassy and rejected as 'litter',\nwhich became rather a by-word!\nAlthough Conservative in conception, we\nhave had support right across the board.\nPage 4 IH HH HH HM IMH Defence of your nation is a national not a party political problem...I felt the petition\nrepresented a growing voice of the silent\npeople of this country. I have no doubt that\nwhat we're doing is absolutely right. The\nresponse we've had is\u2014'I'm so glad that at\nlong last somebody is standing up and\nspeaking about the real feelings of the\npeople of this country. And the noisy\nminority of these so-called peace movements\nare not the true voice of Britain.\nFELIX: How come this 'true voice' hasn't spoken up sooner?\nOM: The thing is, it's very easy to be a rebel. Also, people in this country tend to\ntake the view: 'We vote with our feet; we\n/\nMelanie Steel who conducted the interview\nfor FELIX\ncare about our country, we entrust our\ngovernments with the responsibility of\ndefence.' Till now both Labour and\nConservative have been quite consistent in\ntheir attitudes towards our defence\nresponsibility. The great divide has come\ntoday, in this election, and we will see on\nelection day who is right, how strongly the\npeople feel about one-sided disarmament.\nFELIX: The way you come across in the\nmedia, it seems you have far fewer members\nthan rival groups, such as CND.\nOM: And we have not been going for\ntwenty-five years, we do not have twenty-six\npaid organisers, and we do not have the\nmillions of pounds that the CND have at\ntheir disposal. We survive totally on five\nweeks of existence; we survive on making a plea for donations of '\u00a3 1 for peace'. We went\nnationwide within five days; that is the\nstrength of our movement. We are asking\nthe private person individually to rise up in\nthis country to support us, and that is what\nthey're doing.\nFELIX: What are your views on the CND?\nOM: I personally have talked and debated\nwith the CND, on TV and elsewhere, and\nthe fact is that the leading elements in the\nCND are in sympathy with Moscow; they\nare in sympathy with ultra-left-wing leaders\nand pro-Communist supporters. For them it\nis no horror to be living under a regime that\nis totalitarian, ie a Communist regime.\nBecause they don't feel any fear about it,\nthey see nothing odd in becoming a one-sided disarmed country; they don't see the\nneed to protect ourselves. Now the majority\nof people in this country do actually care\nvery much about our freedom. We care\nabout the way we live, that's what we're\nprotecting. I think sometimes people forget\nwhy we are defending ourselves.\nFELIX: How far are we prepared to go in\ndefending ourselves?\nOM: I think we have to make it absolutely\ncredible that we have them (nuclear\nweapons). We have to have what I describe\nas the minimum nuclear deterrent, unlike\nthe Russians who have the maximum plus.\nFELIX: What if the Russians see the nuclear\nweapons we have not as a deterrent but as a threat, and attack for that reason?\nOM: They outnumber us in every field of\nweaponry there is, and will continue to do\nso. The threat is on the other side.\nThe Russians are top of the class when it\ncomes to masterminding propaganda. It is\nappalling to find that people in this country\nare falling to their in si duo us ness, believing\nthat the poor Russians are threatened. How\nhave they ever been threatened? NATO has\nalways been a defensive alliance, not an\naggressive one. NATO has never taken over\none single country. Since the war, Russia has\nbacked the communist take-over of twenty-eight countries. I'm not saying that the\nfollowers of CND are Communist, but they\nare being manipulated by people who know\nwhat they are doing. They are frightening\npeople, saying 'You don't want your baby\nblown up, do you? Well how can you justify\nhaving nuclear weapons?' It would be more\nrealistic to say 'You don't want your baby\nblown up do you; you want your child to\ngrow up in a free world don't you? So how\nare you going to make sure that will\nhappen?'\nFELIX: Do you think that having nuclear\nweapons is the best way of achieving this?\nOM: I think it is the only way. The Russians\nwill not invade if we show our determination\nto defend ourselves. They only invade\ncountries which are weak and vulnerable.\nFELIX: Are you not concerned that with so\nmany nuclear weapons around the world,\nsomething could go wrong with one of the\nearly warning systems?\nOM: This is a very natural fear. There is a positive agreement, a hotline between\nMoscow and NATO and Washington, that\nthere can be no accidental letting off of\nnuclear weapons. If there is a NATO or\nWarsaw exercise, the first thing each side\ndoes is inform the other of what they are\ndoing.\nHolocaust?\nFELIX: Do you trust the Russians on this?\nOM: Well, it's worked for the last 38 years.\nIt's a proven method.\nFELIX: Even if you trust the Russians to\nplay fair\nOM: \u2014I don't trust the Russians...oh, yes,\non the early warning system.\nFELIX: ...as countries outside NATO acquire their own nuclear weapons, do you\ntrust them also to play fair?\nOM: We have to go in for a similar sort of\nagreement. Countries like Iraq, Iran,\nArgentina, Libya, are all planning to have\ntheir own nuclear weaponry. The evil of\nnuclear weapons is that they exist and will\nnot go away. I have no control over the\nLibyans but I feel sure that there will be\narms control talks with them, just as much\nas there are with Russia.\nFELIX: What are your views on the\nEuropean countries that refuse to have\nnuclear weapons?\nOM: I think they are trying to have their\ncake and eat it, relying on NATO protecting\nthem.\nFinland is in a slightly different position,\nhaving a frontier with Russia and not being\nas strong as Germany. I am certain that if\nFinland had tanks rolling over her frontier\nwe would rise in her defense.\nFELIX: What would we do? Would we use\nnuclear weapons?\nOM: We would meet weapon for weapon. A nuclear weapon would be an ultimate last\nditch resort.\nFELIX: The Russians have far more tanks\nthan we do. How many tanks would you\nplan sending in?\nOM: It's an interesting point. They have\nmore and better tanks with greater firing\npower. So there will be breaking point when\nNATO would have to decide, can they cope\nwith conventional weapons. If it becomes\napparent that they can't, then they must\ndeploy retaliatory weapons. But that is a last\nresort, Russia would have to invade first.\nNATO will always be a defensive alliance,\nand would never attack another country.\nFELIX: But under the right circumstances,\nNATO would be prepared to use the first\nnuclear weapon?\nOM: If it was necessary. It has to be a credible weapon. There's no point having it\nunless you're prepared to use it. But I think\nwe have a much better chance of ensuring\nthat a war doesn't even begin if we show that\nwe have a credible minimum deterrent.\nFELIX: What is your attitude to Switzerland, where, instead of spending money on\nnuclear weapons, they spend it on realistic\ncivil defence?\nOM: It is a much smaller population and\nthat in itself makes it a lot easier. But the\n1983 mmm mmm mmm am mmm real fact is that they are protecting\nthemselves under the umbrella of NATO\u2014I think it's a cheating way of going about\nthings.\nFELIX: Is it cheating to have an effective\ncivil defence plan?\nOM: No, no. It's responsible if you can do it.\nIt is naive to stick your head in the sand. The\nSwiss have a small population with new\nhouses being built, therefore it's much easier\nto have underground shelters, etc. This is\nwhy I support a civil defence plan in this\ncountry; it's common sense.\nFELIX: Do you think the civil defence plan\nin this country is an effective one?\nOM: I'm afraid I don't see how it can ever be\ntruly effective. There is no ultimate defence\nagainst a nuclear bomb attack.\nLady Olga Maitland putting the case for a credible nuclear deterrent\n\"FELIX: So why should we have plans for\ncivil defence?\nOM: Because not everyone would be killed.\nOf course 'Protect and Survive' (the official\nHome Office pamphlet) is unrealistic in the\nsense that it is impossible to survive if\nyou're in the middle of it, but people on the\nperimeter could survive if they take\nprecautions. The principle of the document\nmust be right; people must be told what they\ncan do in the event of attack.\nI think one has a duty to think...how\ndreadful a holocaust is and what the\nappalling effects would be. But the\nimportant thing is to make sure that such an\nevent will never, ever happen, and that's why\nwe must have a deterrent.\nFELIX: One last question\u2014you have\ncriticised the CND for appealing to people's emotions. To some extent isn't your\nmovement also relying on people's emotions\nby saying 'your parents and grandparents\ndied in previous world wars for your\nfreedoms'?\nOM: Are we not all appealing to each\nother's emotions? I am saying that we are\nappealing to the right ones. We look at\nhistory; we look at the present, and at what\nwe want in the future: people died in the past\nfor the freedom we enjoy today. I want to\ncontinue the freedom we have today; you\nmay not but I do, and the majority of people\nin this country want it too.\nPersonal Speculations\nThis interview, the correspondence on the\nFELIX letters page over the last few weeks\nand the articles in the CND issue have\ntogether raised most of the issues of the\nnuclear debate. The arguments both for and\nagainst unilateral disarmament have been\npersuasively put.\nField Marshal Lord Carver, former Chief\nof Defence Staff, said in a House of Lords\ndebate (Dec 1979): 'I believe that the\nretaliation would totally destroy this\ncountry and almost all the inhabitants in it,'\nand the authors of London After The Bomb\nclearly show that the government's planned\ncivil defence measures are neither practical\nnor effective.\nCND says that without nuclear weapons\nthe threat of nuclear attack on Britain would\nnot exist. They suggest that, as a potential\nvictim, Russia will see our weapons as a threat rather than a deterrent and, at a time\nof tension, will resort to attack as the best\nform of defence.\nYet Lady Olga Maitland argues, apparently just as logically, that Russia will not\nattack a country that is prepared to defend\nitself. She also presents C ND as a communist-infiltrated tool of the Russians,\ninducing moral disarray in the basically\npatriotic nation.\nBoth views could be valid. Which is\n'right'? Will the un commited make their\ndecision based on an orator's eloquence?\nWhat are the facts, as opposed to the biased\nopinions, of the debate?\nI do not believe that the facts of such an1 emotive and politically tangled issue can\nevery be put clearly to the 'man in the street'.\nHowever, I do believe that there are some\nfundamental questions, answers to which\nmight help us make up our minds:\nWhat is the Russian threat\u2014are we scared\nof nuclear explosions or of a communist\ntake-over?\nIf we are afraid of the curtailment of our\n'freedom' are we prepared to destroy this\ncountry to preserve it? (NB Lady Olga's answer to this one is: 'Those who prefer to\nbe red\u2014go off to Russia, and take a one-way\nticket'...which rather misses the point.)\nRobert Kelsey quoted Bertrand Russell,\nsaying 'Remember your humanity and\nforget the rest.' But, as well as being capable\nof higher thought and love, man is an\naggressive animal. Even multilateral nuclear\ndisarmament would not change human\nnature and nuclear arsenals could rapidly be\nrestocked with equally horrific biological\nweapons. Would we then be any better off\nthan we are now?\nAre we concerned with the future of our\nplanet ('Green' politics), our our quality of\nlife from day to day (traditional party\npolitics)?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Page5 "

This is the\nresult of many years' abuse of the\nfacilities which culminated this\nyear.\nThe main complaints this year\nwere damage to the library table\nand the state of the floors which,\naccording to Prof Way, the\nDirector of Silwood Park, will\ntake months to rectify. The\nlibrary table was badly stained\nby red wine and hot water and\nthis was after RCS Presidentelect Eric Derbyshire had been\ntold not to use the library for\nanything but a cloakroom.\nDamage was also caused to\nthe front lawn when one of the\ncoaches drove across it. This has\nparticularly annoyed the reside nc ts since the lawn is held in\ngreat esteem at Silwood.\nThis was in addition to\nallegations that the place was\nnot cleaned properly. It was\nbecause of this that the Silwood\nresidents complained to the\nwarden and as a consequence\nProf Way informed former RCS\nPresident Karl Schmidt that\nRCS would have to find an\nalternative venue for the Ball.\nLast Friday Mr Schmidt met\nProf Way to discuss the matter\nbut was unable to persuade him\nto change his mind. This was\nbecause Silwood residents did\nnot want RCS to use their\nfacilities any more, and while\nProf Way sym pathis ed with\nRCS, he said that his residents\nmust come first.\nPoof in\nBoots?\nNick Gardner, IC's resident\neccentric, has entrusted FELIX\nwith a Czechoslovakian riding\noutfit for use by the FELIX\nEditor on formal occasions.\nMr Gardner explained that he\nhas long been disappointed that\nthe FELIX Editor has no official\ndress and he feels that the riding\noutfit fills this long-felt want\nadmirably.\nThe outfit is too small for the\ncurrent Editor, Martin S Taylor\n('too big for his boots' as the\nstaff were quick to point out) so\nit is here shown being modelled\nby Union President Stephen\nGoulder in his capacity as\nPresident of the FELIX Club.\nChas\nto Sue?\nCharles Fuller, RCS Honorary\nSecretary and acting President, is\nconsidering suing ICU Deputy\nPresident John McCallion and\nFELIX Editor Martin S Taylor\nover allegedly libellous comments\nmade in the Deputy President's annual report and the FELIX\nEditorial.\nIn an exclusive interview on\nWednesday afternoon Mr Fuller\ntold FELIX that he had not yet\nseen his solicitor but was waiting\nto see what was written about\nthe matter in today's edition.\nHis concern stems from a paragraph on transport in the\nDeputy President's report in\nwhich Mr McCallion alleges that\na Union van was used for\nmascot ry purposes when Mr\nFuller was well aware that this is\nprohibited under Union rules.\nMr Taylor in his editorial\nsupported Mr McCallio'n, and\ndescribed Mr Fuller's attitude as\n'incredibly petty'.\nEditorial comment-page 3.\nNo.6481I Friday, June 10,19831\nChas Fuller\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Free!

    "content": "The Red Rag\nLast week I described Chas\nFuller's attitude as incredibly\npetty when he threatened a no\nconfidence motion in the Exec.\nBecause of-my comment he has\nnow started talking of taking\nlegal action against me.\nI suppose one should feel\nsorry for someone whose personal pride is so great that he\nreacts so violently to criticism,\nbut I really find it quite impossible to take Chas seriously any\nmore, and I know most of the\nsenior Union officials do too.\nSo here you are Chas: I do not\nretract anything I wrote last\nweek\u2014indeed, I feel that you are\nbeing more petty than ever in\nyour threats of legal action\n(which I believe to. be quite\nempty). Nevertheless, if you still\nfeel as strongly as you did on\nWednesday then go ahead and\nsue me. I look forward to\nreceiving your writ with anticipation: Next Week's FELIX\nAs expected, this week's FELIX\nhas turned out rather smaller\nthan usual and many of the\nregular features have been cut;\nnot that many of you are going\nto be reading it, of course, with\nnational news being a little more\nEDITORIAL\nimportant than the future of the\nSilwood Ball.\nNext week, though, I hope to\nproduce a bumper issue with all\nthe regular features and several\npages of special articles for the\nsummer. In particular, there will\nbe a double-spread of Pinocchio\npuzzles (his final bow), a lighthearted news quiz on the goings-on throughout the year, an\narticle by Stephen Goulder on\nRCS, an article by RCS on\nStephen Goulder, a sporting\nreview of the year from sports\neditor Chris Mallaband and an\nun sporting review of the year\nBelow the Belt which will\ncontain all the incriminating\nstories and photographs we\nhaven't dared to print sooner.\nCopy deadline was 5:30pm yesterday (I warned you last\nweek) but since there is quite a bit of controversial material in\nthis issue I 've extended the\ndeadline for letters until Monday\n9:30am. Naturally I would appreciate\nas much help as possible from\nstaff members past and present\nin putting it all together, and\nvast quantities of unskilled\nlabour will be needed to help\ncollate next Wednesday evening.\nPublication date is next\nThursday morning. Don't miss\nit!\nACC\nThe ACC elections are on\nTuesday evening at 6:30pm in\nthe Lower Refectory and it is\nessential that all captains, both\nnew and old, turn up.\nCar Rally\nPinocchio and I have done the\nbulk of the work on setting lots\nof witty and entertaining clues\nfor you to solve, so I hope there\nwill be a good number of teams\nentering.\nSeveral people have told me\nthey would like to enter, but\nhave no car; others have a car\nbut cannot get a team together,\nso if either of these predicaments\napply to you, be not deterred but\ncome and give your names to me\nas soon as possible and I 'll\nmatch up earles s teams with\nteam less cars.\nThe rally starts at 9:30am on\nSunday June 19 and goes on\nuntil about 1:00pm.
