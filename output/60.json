For there, right ahead of you, gentlemen, is the Holy of Ho lies, the home of all homes from home,the Bar. The Bar... the meeting place of the cream of college society, the home of good hitter and good song,the land of the high stool and the shining tankard. And of course Ted and Tom.\nTed Smith, the head barman,has been here for twenty six years. In that time you can well imagine that he\nhas seen many changes both in the College and the students. There was a time when women were not all o wed in the Union Buildings except for the Upper Entrance Hall. Infringements of this rule were severely dealt with by the President( happy days). Apart from these more material changes, various oust om s have\narisen and died out. Years ago, for instance, the wearing of beards was frowned upon j and there o a me a time when one ohara o ter absolutely refused to remove his pride arid joy.The story goes that he suffered the if ate of many pioneers against the use of blade and\nbrush,namely,he had half his beards horn off by his more hairless fellow. students. Another custom\nwhich is still with us, was ably demonstrated to tb Field Marshall Smuts when he visited the I.C. Bar; the Field Marshall asked Ted, about the Bull Chain wh i oh hangs on the wall near the_ dartboard. As Ted puts it~V* he Bar was o row ded at the time and before you could say' another bitter, please' Field Marshall Smuts was adorned with the aforementioned obj eot and\" had to pay the penalty of' drinks all round'.Ted remembers other famous people who have partaken in the Bar; the night he served Xawrenoe of Arabia with a mild and bitter; H.G. Well s,an old R.C.S. student,popped in for a drink one\nevening; the Earl of Athlone, Chancellor of London\nUniversity, has admired the shining array of tankards w hio hare kept' in the Bar j Freddie Brown,the English Cricket Captain, on oe came to aMines Carnival and by\nall accounts thoroughly enjoyed himself. Ted himself has the distinction of being a member\nof the Chaps Club, the Links Club, the22 Club and the the Comus Club. His interests^ ange from s ooo er, readings hove halfpenny and students to tapping a barrel of beer in the right and proper manner.His mate.Tom\nHarvey has been a tI.C. for nearly two years. Tom\nis a quiet sort of oha p, and when asked about his1 interests he said he preferred to remain anonymous.\nNELSON'S COLUMN Alltogether, sing Ring the bell Guilds men, ring the bell, ring Perhaps the President will condescend to sing, Up in the belfry two yellow bells Of the presence of Miners tells.

UNION MEETING The Union meeting held on Tuesday23 rd. February had two visitors. One was Mr. Douglas Mayer (Gen.\nSec. of W.U. S.) and the other was Beaver( of L.S.E. Mr. Meyer was present to outline the work of the\nWorld University Service. Ha spoke very eloquently ana afterwards the Union decided to support this organisation. The Council's proposals for hops\nwere then stated( These proposals are as given in FELIX Ho. 5 8 ) . Mr. Champney then proposed that the Council's polio y be rejected. He spoke at some\nlength on the implications of the proposals but his motion was defeated. It was then further proposed that the Maximum price^ for a single ticket for a hop run by aol ub should be 1/9,and\nthis was carried. It' was reported that Jim Anderson( President, R.C.S.) had attended the IT .U.S. conference on\nGrants. This decided to set up grants committees for four groups of colleges, one j> fw hi oh was\nUniversity colleges.. At present there are2 members\non this committee: One from U.C. and one\nBirk be ok. N.U.S. have ruled that I.C., although! a non-member,can s it on the committee and if it does so it will be without obligation to join H.U.S. or abide by its decision on other topics. The conference decided not to proceed with tha\ngrants conference at L.S.E. sino e the H.U.S. i a the only body representing students, that is r the Government. There seemed to be\nindications that I.C. might be asked to s it on'\ne and the Union was asked if it waa\nI.C.s ending a representative in tis e event of eleet ion to the grants committee. ion agreed. A proposal was made for setting up our own grants and welfare oom mitte e. This was rejected, the President adding that the\nCouncil would implement the work of our represent-at ives to the grants committee, and if necessary, would set up a ocr an oil subcommittee to deal with the matter. Mr. S. Rukenann then described the work of the British Youth Festival Committee w hio his hoping to organise a festival in Great Britain after the lines of the one held in Bu oha rest last year. He\nproposed that the Union should el eot2 delegates to represent I.C.U., at the assembly of youth to\nbe held in London in May. His proposal was put to the_ V Q te and carried120 to80. Mr. Higson asked If it was true that the Union oo ul d vote itself money, in which ease the Union could pay fines incurred on last November 5th.. The President\" answered that council administers finance and would certainly not pay any fines incurred by rag activities. Mr. Haskew attempted to Justify the claim t for ree om pens e from Union Funds by stating that sino e he was fined so\nheavily, London Transport had drop pet* the intention of sue ing the Union for damage done to\nao ert a in underground train. This argument was\ndismissed. One speaker said that most people s'ide a of arag was-'not to break up underground trains, and these sentiments wen? eo hoed by the Un ll oh.

The/ result was quite promising, the1 st,2 nd and3 rd VII Is won, the4 th losing by 4fc length s,k The 2nd VII Is rowed off first from Hammersmith[\nBridge to Putney Bridge, the I.C. crew winning after two clashes and are start at the milepost. \u2022 The 4 th VII Is started next, when the Reading stroke broke his stretcher and the crews had to\nreturn to the boat ha use. When the repair had been completed the tide had turned and the remaining races were rowed in the other direction. In the1 st VII Is' row both crews were cold to begin with and consequently rather scrappy. However the I.C. crew soon settled down and beat the Reading crew by three lengths. The third VIII beat Reading by\n2/3 length after a closer a oe. On the previous Saturday the bth VIII, a fresher crew went to South hampton water to meet Southham\npt on University2 nd VIII. They were beaten after a fairly good row by two l lengths over a two mile c course. However, in view of the relative experience of the crews the result is quite pleasing and\nbodes well for the summer season. The crew was: M,D. G. Garner ( bow), D. B.R. Hill, J.A.Far rant, D.M.

Conditions\nat Harlington were about per f eot and the sp eot at or s,/ including two oo a oh loads of Vets., saw a fast and\nexciting game. iI. C. kicked off into the breeze, but play o a me back'\nto midfield, and the bustling tactics of the \u2014 ~\nopposing forwards led to some defensive dithers* v before the team settled down. The R.V. C. banks were\nmu oh h arras ed by Chester and Robinson and failed to\nmake use of the wind. to gain ground. Consequently\nwe generally held a territorial advantage and made\nseveral incursions into our opponents 25. Following one of these Lewis missed with a reasonably straight forward penalty kick, but before half-time he\nsucceeded with. a fine one from far out on the left. This waa the only so q re at the interval. The\nVets, resumed with a strong atta ok and only Just\nlost the rao e for a rolling ball behing our goal, line, but they were eventually driven back by some\nlong down-field kio ks from Holman and Lewis. I.C. were now getting a large share of the ball and they\nset up a series of atta ok s. Spooner, on the Right\nwing, twi oe o a me near scoring, and a passing\nmovement by the forwards broke down an the goal line itself. The Vets, forwards were obviously tiring under the im act of the I.C. eight, ably marshalled BADMINTON\nWith the U.L. Men'a Championship Cup\n- 'Haroombe Cup' residing in the Union, the\nclub started the season with high hopes.\nIn spite of se me stronger opposition than last year, the men's first team have\nagain reached the final of the league with the following wins : -v.U.

Ten minutes from the end they were penal is ed under their own posts and Lewis made no mistake with the kick. In the closing minutes play again re ao he d the Vets, line and Hy kin eluded the defence on the blindside to score wide on +he left. Lewis converted with an excellent kick. CHESS\nSo far, touch wood, the Chess Club had a very r. oa season. In the University of London League, i vision1, we have won all matches we played; if this record can be kept up during the next three( james we will recapture the Cup, absent from the Old Lounge f.,r the last3 yes rs. In division2, our score so far is won: 2;\ndrawn: 1; lost:1, and we have a good, chance of winning that division as well.

The wins\nover Q.M. C. and Goldsmiths were deserved,\nbut the loss against L.S.E. was the fault of the men who have not in general been as effective at this form of doubles.\nAlthough only about, six ladies a tI.C. play, they have turned out a team on all occasions and have done quite well. So many of the senior members Of tha\nclub left the College la at year that tha\nyears second team are practically all new to match play. As a result they have met with little success and have so far not recorded a victory. However we trust that the\nexperience they gain this year will stand\nthem in good value and that they will not\nbe discouraged.\nThis season four of the team have\nrepresented the University on many occasions, a larger number than for several years. Congratulations to Tony Walker on his ele c tion, a sU.L.

Credit is particularly due to Messrs, Paokham, Moulder, and\nRotgans, all new to the team, who successfully held their higher graded opponents to draws. Of\nthe other contests, that of Jim Maopheraon, the\no lub. seo ret ary was particularly notable for the\nefficient way in wh i oh he disposed of his opponent\nwith two neat ankle throws. Oxford produced a bla ok belt to meet Ken Wooldridge ( lot Kyn) who\nwas thrown convincingly by two stomach throws,. .\nAfter the match, Mr. nara mura, the chief instructor at the Budokwal ( the leading o lub lit England) demonstrated a few of his more potent\nthrows, in ol udin ga spectacular Uohi-mata which\nwill remain in the memories of the aud leno e( and\nparticularly Ken Wooidridge who waa t ne guinea pig)\nfor many moons. _ .\u00bb\nImperial College3 Cambridge University0 On Saturday, 2 0 th February I.C.J.

    "content": "4 FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nDear Sir, Writing as one with experience of the\ndifficulties of producing FELIX, I offer you\nmy heartiest congratulations on the product ion of the supplement to your last issue. Many editors before you have been faced with the problem of important news arriving just after FELIX goes \"to press, but none has\nsolved it in so determined a manner as yours elf. Apart from the maroon and silver appear- '\nan oe of a few purple passages, the whole thing was, in my opinion, excellently done, and will serve as a model of industry, organisation and\njournalism to those Editora,-unborn and un-begot, who will be faced with similar problems\nin years to come.\nyours sino e rely, A.H. Bray\nDear Sir, Do you really think that20 Guildsmen\ncould successfully attack a party of 200 R.C.S? Do you really think that a dozen or more\npairs of R.C.S. trousers were seen hanging in Hyde Park?\nDo you really think that the R.C.S. men would\n* throw a Guildsman over the Serpentine bridge on to\nthe ice?\nMay I suggest, air, that you remove the oat\nfrom the front page of FELIX and substitute a spanner? ' j Yours faithfully, Pro Bono R.C.S. Sir, We feel that the misstatement of fact given\nin the last issue of Felix must not go unquestioned. We would like to point out to you - to\nsave any further unnecessary misunderstanding -that, of the nine R.C.S. men concerned in \"pinch-ing the spanner\" only ONE - repeat ONE - accepts\nthe \" hospitality of the Guilds lecture courses\".\nTwo further of these, admittedly, were waiting on\nbicycles on the opposite side of the road from\nGuilds. We feel that the ONE who was \"unsuspected\" was\noffset in advantage by the fact that two R.C.S. ties were worn and tn at an R.C.S. union official was also present.\nFurthermore, the necessary information which\nformed t ne basis of the raid was obtained last session, by accident, by two people who were not\nin Guilds by invitation. We remain, etc, A. Goodinga\nM. Gadsden\nS.C. S.( Physics Department)\nDear Sir, Much abuse has been poured, by the College in general, and Felix in particular on the heads of\nthe poor spineless creatures of Guilds who stood\nby and watched the \" dastardly deed\" committed.\nNo doubt this conjures up a picture of\nscruffy little brown-bag gers, their sports coats slashed with yellow, standing paralysed with fright while th,e gallant Jasper vainly defended\nour honour single handed against R.C. S.hor da. Naturally this scene leads people to question the effectiveness of the college selection board.\nI am, however, one of the abused and I take\nthis opportunity to present the facts of the matter\nthe first, I am led to believe, that you have\nreceived. A few members of the College and five or six R.C.S. infiltrators were viewing the notice boards in the Guilds entrance hall when the bearer\nof the Spanner appeared. He was Immediately set upon and surrounded by the R.C.S. and by the time\nthe noise attracted attention t ne Spanner was no\nlonger visible. Tne victim was hustled out of\nthe door in a matter of fifteen seconds, and cont ra ry to common report, t ne only cry uttered was\n\"Help l\"as the victim went tn rough tha door.\nNeither Guild a nor the Spanner were mentioned.\nThere was, in fact, nothing to prevent the\ncurious spectator from assuming tn at an intruder from another College was being evicted. The moral of this incident is that if one\nsees anything unusual taking pla oe one should\nimmediately investigate as there is no telling what\nR.C.S.( falsetto) will get up to next.\nYoura faithfully, \"Rubber Spine\"\nDear Sir, Scottish Country Dancing\nI should like to draw the attention of your\nreaders to the Scottish Country Dancing classes which are held on alternate Fridays, in the New\nLounge. Increased support from I.C. members of both\nsexes would be very welcome - the shortage of men\nbeing particularly serious. Previous experience is not essential, the\nmain object of the classes being to provide an\nevening's entertainment, without aspiring to per-fec tion. I might point out that there is no sub scrip tion'.\nDetails of dates and times can be seen on the\nDancing Club Notice Board.\nD.M. Macpherson\nDear Sir, May I use your columns to express my d is appointment at the quality of the lunch hour\nlectures? This excellent idea of holding these General\nStudies lectures is being undermined by their poor\ndelivery; for while the lecturers are undoubtedly\nexperts in their own fields, their ability to\ndeliver an interesting lecture in the time avail able is limited. In order to use the time to the best advantage, could not the ridiculous dual-chairman\nsystem be abolished - if it is desired to give a few students experience in introducing speakers,\nthen I am sure that any student selected for the\ntalk would be quite able to say the required words\nof introduction and thanks without the necessity of being chaperoned by a college lecturer.. Then\nby- making the introduction at a few minutes to\n1-30 the lecturer could be given a full55 minutes\nto 2-25, when the vote of/ thanks could be brief and to the point or even entirely absent, as the\nspontaneous applause of the audience is far better thanks than any formal set of words. At a recent\nlecture, by the time the vi Bit or was allowed to\nspeak it was l35 \u00bb and they were cut short at 2-20\nto allow two votes of thanks - the 10 minutes thu a was wasted depriving the audience of a short film and preventing the lecturer from rounding off the\ntalk. The practice of allowing15 minutes for questions at the end of a lecture barely twice\nthat long is a waste of time - those able to ask\nquestions probably have had3 ome previous acquaintance with the subject, while those with no prior knowledge would not have heard enough in half an\nhour for them to be able to frame an intelligent question. Finally, it would probably help' several of the lecturers if they were given the\nopportunity of spreading their lecture by giving them two periods in one week.\nYours sincerely, o fi.J. Foster Dear Sir,. With respect to the brief discussion on grants\nin the last Union meeting, we would like to make\nthe following points dear.1) The Government when firing the present\nState Scholarship rates made it quite clear that thi a level was considered the basic minimum amount\nf required for the students' self sufficiency.2) The Government recommended the L.E.A's to\npay grants at this 'State' level. The majority of L.E.A's have refused to do this.3) By the Government's own cost of living index, the cost of living has risen26)1 since then.\n4) In1947 the Government said that the mini mum number of students this country needed to\nMAINTAIN its present academic standing was 100,000\nW1950. The number of student a at present is less than 75\u00bb000 - a deficiency due in great part to these insufficient grants. We therefore feel that the Union Council i a pursuing a blind policy in suggesting that all it a actions should be concerned only with cases of individual hardship. It should as far as possible lead a campaign on a National Level for higher grants, this being in both the students' and the\nnational interests, as is recognised already by the\nGovernment.\nYours a in oe rely, John Cox\nSteve Farrow\nJack Moreland\nhear\" Sir,I was Intrigv by the discussion on\nHop pr loe e at the Union meet in\u00bb-, and to spot a loop-hole. It i a possible for a Club to escape\nthe l/9 dela use, which specifically refers to in formal han ee o, by o ailing Its da noo 'Seal-formal'\nmeaning lou n fie aul ts.I don'treme m Ver any formality In the conduct of Carnivals. Do they oo r.ei xn& Gr tha rule tooT Ob happy day'.\nYours e to., Op Iial st. "

Soccer Final on Saturday30 th February. During the mata h they found difficulty in protecting him from the Battersea supporters and deposited their precious animal in a safe place. Derek Power\nand Brian Smith, playing for the U.L. U. Hockey Team, saw the animal resting behind a wall in the Rookery and gave him a ride in their oar. In the evening, Beaver was on view at the I.C. Hop and reappeared at the Union meeting on Tuesday. It retired into the unknown u it il Saturday morning. On Friday a telegram was sent to L.S.E. saying,\" Amphibious broad tailed rodent has Imperial feelings after period of wanderlust. Hopes to eat pancakes at home.\"\nAa a result, about40 L.S.E. people( men and women) visited I.C. after milling around the Union. BLEAVER? BLEAVER?

The stage was a master pie oe of decoration, and the bar was particularly attractive.( Until2 a.m.'.) John Morgan and his Music took the stand until the cabaret. Tniff\"commenced, after numerous apologies for the delay, with a delightful rendering of 3 Chinese songs by a GENUINE Chinese ld dy. This was followed by a song by two Guilds men, pv of easing to come from\" Virgins' Retreat\". The final; turn in a very short cabaret invited the gathering \"Come on a my house\" but we don't know if anyone\nwent. The closing of the bar put more un partnered men at the devil's disposal. This un balance of the sexes resulted in an all male demonstration ef th a Samba , and an eight some real by six men and the decorations at the door. It waa\nthen discovered that all the drinking equipment\nhad not been removed*- a soda syphon was available. This changed hand a rapidly but eventually came into the hands of a white helmeted character. Those in a position to do so were then able to enjoy the unusual spectacle of a much braided admiral defending himself with an umbrella from th a deluge of soda water.

Although the band was composed in a manner different to that of the traditional, Hew Orleans lineup, their playing of this number approached that of Bunk Johnson.

THREE UNION MEETINGS The Guilds and R.C.S. thought along the same\nlines for once. In both the respective Union Meet in gs, Presidents and members a like expressed sorrow at the unfortunate turn of events in the Rag. Collections were made to defray expenses, the Engineers collecting \u00a310, the Scientists \u00a37. All other business was relegated to secondary status. The Mines Union had no worries on this point. They supported buying an old traction engine as a mascot, capable of facing smaller insignia without a qualm should such occasions arise.

After a\\ stand-up-and-grab tea the speaker, Mr. MoClure, gave his introductory talk, wh i oh outlined the topic and set us talking during the seo on d hour. At 6.30 p.m. we\nretired to the bar and followed this with dinner In. the fields tait ion refectory. The dinner, which included roast chicken, provided a good\nbess is on which to talk in the group discussions wh i oh followed. In these the parties had split Into three groups each with& chairman, who made\nnotes of what was said for the summing-up on\nSunday. One group remained in the Library unt il midnight, by wh i oh time certain others had\nvisited the \"Cannon\" and had played at least one game of snooker in the games room. When\nwe retired at 1.30 some were still playing. \u2022The following morning most of us enjoyed walks\n, in or about Windsor Great Park, but some stal warts waited outside the local until it opened.\nLunch, in ol u ding roast pork was followed by an\nhour to sleep it off. Those who did not wish\nto rest took part in some more strenuous act'ivities such as playing Chess, reading magazines\nor toying with the radiogram. At three o 'clock\nthe groups assembled to report their findings and the speaker summed up. At four o 'clock\nTea. followed, and at five o 'clock we left. Touchstone proved to be an enjoyable weekend in pleasant surroundings ( all at all in charge of 10/-, too!).

M. will introduce the to pio\" Criminal Resp on sibi lt y\"ON DE BAGGING More de bagging s per person per hour took place in I.C. last* week than ever before. Our statistician has worked out that the rate was somewhere\nnear0.001, which in words means that one person\nout of every thousand was de bagged every hour of\nthe working day for one week. This is t ne highest rate ever attained in this community, and is only\n.exceeded by one other group in the country s tha\nunder six months. What was remarkable about these incidents was\nthat they seemed to be accepted as a matter of cou r se.T his change in attitude, turning into ama a a movement what were till now essentially individual affairs, resulted in them being dismissed almost\ncasually in FELIX( the Rag Supplement to). It records, we noted, i)' Wholesale de bagging;' ii)' L Lampposts decorated with trousers;' iii)' A Guilds man lost his trousers...;' iv)' Seeing a suitable pair,.. re equipped hi aS f tlf.' v) The R.C.S. President losing his pair^ It does not record;.' vi) One lost when an R.C.S. member was found la the attacking Guilds crowd, vii) Two Guilds pairs held as hostages while Miners were taking the Guilds paint from banister*. All this on two days. What happened on the Fri day before was additional. I should think I.C. will get tired unless it is so already of this particular sport pretty soon. It is a bit frustrating, really; and not at all pleasant for the\nvictim. I hasten to add that I do not presume to speak from personal experience. I know atleast one person who did not go to his R.C. S.lab. on Tuesday afternoon because he\nhad his best flannels on. If the garments in ques tion are bags in the real sense, it matters not.\nBut it is a bit cruel when one is sporting ones Burberry or Austin Reed apparel.( You' ll notice the subtle way in which I work in the advertising,' A model for commercial TV.)\nI was just about to embark, after my fashion, on a masterly analysis of the expressions of people dressed impeccably from the waist up and the\nankles down. But it does not come out very well in considered remarks, losing its spontaneity. I am irresistibly reminded of a story I read in an old FELIX, however. Chelsea attacked the Union one cold evening three years ago, expecting to po'lish up the place. They ran instead into:, \"ines\ni' res ner s coming out from their dinner. After a nec tic half hour, the liners had ten trousers and\nnine Chelsea men in tn eir possession.

Ea oh man runs one lap of2 J miles long). Apart from the London Colleges, teams have been entered from Cambridge, Oxford, and from other provincial Universities. They will compete for the Rode rio Hill Trophy, a cup presented for the event by the Rector of I.C. Among those who hope to be running will be D. Macmillan, Australian Champion and Olympic1,500 metres finalist, J.Dl s ley, National Champion and Olympic Steeplechase medallist, R.H. Dunk ley and T. Keegan, both members of World Record relay teams. Last year's winners were L.S.E. and the new lap record of13 min.9 sec. was set up by\nR.H. Dunk ley. This year keen competition is expected for both teams and individual honours. The start and finish( which is the changeover point) take spla oe on the doorstep of I.C.
