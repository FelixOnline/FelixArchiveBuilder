    "content": "THE FACTS The laws of different regions have some things in common: robbery and murder,\nfor example are practically always forbidden. This is because people are practically\nunanimous about certain rights, which are called human rights be case we possess\nthem in virtue of our humanity, independently of the law. As well as necessarily\nembodying many less fundamental rights, laws unfortunately often fail to protect\nhuman rights and even threaten or deny them. An example of a denial in national law is\nthe apartheid laws of South Africa; an example of a failure to protect in international\nlaw is the United Kingdom's suspension of its obligation to respect some of the most\nimportant rights in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including\nthe right to freedom of expression. There are also countless cases in which governments and their agents abuse human rights in breach of their own laws.\nThe rights most worth citing in practice are legal ones, since those in power are\nusually constrained by nothing else short of violence, and discussion of more theoretical rights tends to be prolonged. But human rights can be worth citing even when\nthey are not legally binding, firstly as a step to their incorporation into law and\nsecondly because of governments' occasional sensitivity to public opinion.\nThe task of enforcing and improving the laws related to human rights, which is\nneglected or opposed by most governments, is undertaken by different organisations\nat the global and local scales. The most important defender of fundamental rights on a global scale is Amnesty International, founded by a British lawyer, Peter Beneson, and\nothers, as a result of their observation that governments accused of abuses of human\nrights often took the trouble to issue denials, thereby showing themselves sensitive to\npublic opinion. The organisation was founded to implement the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights and the principal activity of its individual members is to send, three\ntimes a month, tens of thousands of letters from 150 countries reminding a government of its duties towards a non-violent citizen imprisoned for his opinions. The\nsuccess of this method, which is due partly to the large numbers and partly to its being\napplied only to the most indisputable violations, is the main example in the world of\neffective non-legal defence of human rights.\nOn the national scale other organisations try to respect for human rights in\nthe ordinary law. The main one in Britain is the National Council for Civil Liberties,\nwhich also provides individual legal help to the victims of unjust or misapplied laws and\nreports illegal acts by the police. Like each of the national sections of Amnesty\nInternational, the N CCL has a head office and its members may also be members of a local, group.\nCharles Penman\nSOCIALIST SOCIETY\nTHE 'DISAPPEARED PRISONERS'\nThe 'disappeared prisoner' is the name we\ngive to members of our families who have\nbeen taken from our homes, in front of our\neyes, or in their work places, colleges and\nuniversities, with eye witnesses or strong\nproof of their detention. The people who\ndetained them were members of the military\nintelligence services. They are being held in\nsecret and all our efforts, such as writs of\nha be as corpus, affidavits of kidnapping, and\nletters and interviews with government\nofficials, have been flung back in our faces\nwith the following answer: 'The person has\nnever been detained.' There are variations\nsuch as: 'He has left the country.' or 'He has\ngone into hiding.' 'He has been kidnapped by\na band of extremists' and so forth.\nThis is of the many appeals by the families\nof the 'disappeared' in Chile. But this is not\nsoley a Chilean form of repression. Hitler\ninvented the method 'Nacht und Nebel',\n('night and fog') in 1941 as a means of denying\nmartyrs to the French Resistance. Detainees\nwere transported to Germany secretly,\nvanishing without trace. There is as yet no\ncomprehensive record of political 'disappear-ances' in modern times although sufficient\nevidence exists to indicate that this means of\nrepression is widely used.\nBut no global survey or legal analysis of the\nproblem, though clearly of value, could\nconvey the tormented hope of those who\nwait, the parents and friends desperately\ntrying to find out about their loved ones.\nTheir experience of loss is real and\nimmediate and is aggravated by uncertainty.\nOn the one hand, there are the mass graves\nthat are occasionally unearthed, and on the\nother hc in d, the hope that is derived from\nreports that a 'disappeared' prisoner has\nbeen seen or heard in custody.\nThe term 'disappeared' is in quotation\nmarks because these prisoners have not, in\nthe usual sense of that word, simply\nvanished. Someone knows where they are,\nwhether they are still in secret custody or in\nnameless graves. Someone knows whether\nthey have been or are being tortured,\nwhether they died under torture. And there is\nsomeone, in authority, who is responsible!\nPage 10\nADOPTED PRISONER\nFIRMIN AWADON OF BENIN\nThe Amnesty International group's adopted\nprisoner is Firmin Awadon a student at the\nUniversity of Benin, a one-party state in West\nAfrica. In 1979 the government ordered all\nstudents to work on state farms during the\nholidays when they were needed by their\nfamilies to work on their own farms.\nConsequently there was a strike by the\nstudents that summer which resulted in\nindiscriminate arrests at the university.''\nAwadon was held for 8 months without any\nexplanation and he has still not been\ncharged. From time to time he has been told \u2022\nthat he is innocent of any crime and is about\nto be released. The civil prison of Contonou\nwhere he is held is overcrowded and sewage\nis buried in the courtyard although according\nto Awadon money is provided for it to be\ntaken away. Consequently many prisoners\ndie from preventable illnesses, there being\nhardly any medical treatment and no food\nexcept what visitors bring in.\nThe arrested students have often demanded as political prisoners, not to be kept\namong violent criminals in the civil prison.\nAfter one of their protests they were beaten\nup in the courtyard. Awadon still suffers from\nthe head injuries which he received.\nFirmin Awadon is adopted by three groups\nof Amnesty International, the other two\nbeing in West Germany and Italy. Our\nactivities have consisted of many letters to\nhis government, some to the prison g over nor, a visit to the Beninese embassy in Paris\nand aid, such as clothes, books and money to\n. him. A letter from the foreign minister inviting\nAmnesty International to talks in Benin this\nyear suggested that the authorities were\nembarrassed by the large quan it ties of mail\nfrom Amnesty group members and others;\nand by the bad name which the press gave\nthem.\nSince last summer there have been hints of\nan improvement in Awadon's treatment and\nprospects for release and he has been able to\ncommunicate almost openly with us. We\nhave just learned that he has been admitted\nto hospital for treatment of his head injury.\nWe invite students to help him on 8 and 9\nDecember by writing letters and signing a petition.\n\"Okay, okay\u2014have your say, and I 'll re-pack your things for the Hunting Lodge.'\nAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL\nAmnesty International seeks the release of\npeople imprisoned for their beliefs, who have\nnot used or advocated violence. It also campaigns for fair trials and against inhuman\npunishments.\nIt is financed by individuals' and groups'\nsubscriptions and is independent of all governments and political parties. Individual\nmembers may belong to one of their\ncountry's local groups, some of which adopt\na prisoner and work for his release.\nThe Imperial College group's adopted\nprisoner is Firmin Awadon of Benin, who has\nbeen detained without charge for four years\nbecause he was thought to have protested at\nhis government'sim po site wi of farm labour\non students during the vacation. This year\nthe group cycled to the nearest Beninese\nembassy (in Paris) to raise the matter with\nthe cultural attac he. It continually demands\nhis release from the Benin authorities and\nseeks publicity of the facts to shame the\ngovernment.\nThe group also takes part in the 'urgent\naction' scheme for prisoners facing torture or\nimminent execution and in special actions\nsuch as the current campaign against\nrepression and torture by the military\nauthorities in Uruguay.\nThe group has a noticeboard outside the\nJunior Common Room and meets in the\nBrown Committee Room of the Union at\n5:30pm every Tuesday. It is showing a film\n'AI: Prisoners of Conscience' at 12:45 on 5\nDecember in ME342, and collecting money\non 8 Dec.\nADOPTED PRISONER\nANATOLY SHCHARANSKY\nIn spite of fashionable (and healthy) criticism\nof the 'Western System', there are many\naspects of our lives that we take for granted.\nIt is assumed that hard work and excellence\nin any creative field will be rewarded, whether\nit be by professional prestige, or by financial\nr enumeration. Discrimination by colour,\nrace or religion is deplored by the vast\nmajority of people. For such discrimination\nto be a policy of the State is unthinkable.\nPerhaps most important of all is the\nassumption that it is always possible to leave\na country where one is unhappy. Imagine\nthen living in a country where people of a particular race are labelled from birth as\nbeing a 'danger to the state', and as being a legitimate target for persecution. Imagine\nliving in a country where intellectual\nachievement is avoided, for fear of being\ndrawn attention to, or being made party to\n'State secrets'.\nAnatoly Shcharansky is a mathematician,\nchessmaster and computer scientist who has\nhad the misfortune of being born a Jew in the\nSoviet Union. On graduating from the\nInstitute of Physics in 1972, he refused to\nwork in his profession, so as to avoid\n'classified' work. He applied for a visa to\nIsrael in 1973 and was refused, on the pretext\nthat he had 'access to classified material'.\nOver a subsequent period of four years he\nserved 12 prison sentences, all without\ncharges. His wife Avital left for Israel on 5\nJuly 1974, the day her visa expired. In May\n1976 he became a founder member of the\nCommittee for the Implementation of the\nHelsinki Agreement knowing full well the\nrisks of speaking up for human rights in the\nSoviet Union.\nAfter a period of KGB h arras s ment, and\nslander in the national media, Shcharansky\nwas arrested on 15 March 1977. Even Soviet\nlaw stipulates that a prisoner may not be held\nfor more than 9 months without trial.\nShcharansky was held incommunicado for 16\nmonths. At the end of the that time, a trial\nwas held in a closed court. Leonid\nShcharansky, Jew, scientist, 'traitor of the\nmotherland', 'Anti-Soviet Agitator', and'Spy'\nwas sentenced to three years in prison\nfollowed by ten years in labour camp-'strict\nregime. He is still serving that sentence,\nhaving been transferred to Christopol\nPrison to Perm Camp in March 1980. In his\ninternment he has been beaten up, put on\nstarvation diets and spent time in solitary\nconfinement, in hair-raising conditions. In\nJanuary 1979 Shcharansky lay down during\nthe day (due to sickness) thus breaking a prison rule. He was placed in a punishment\ncell and was deprived of the right to family\nvisits. By April 1980 he was reported to have\nweighed 61\n/2 stone, and to look like a prisoner\nof Auschwitz. In the meantime his family's property was confiscated, and his father\ndied. In 1982 he was held in the notorious\n'Kartser' punishment cell for 75 days. This is\nconsidered to be such a severe tribulation\nthat the maximum period of confinement\nallowed by Soviet law is 15 days. The guards\nobserved this law by letting him out\nfor three hours every fortnight.\nFrom September 1982 till January 1983\nShcharansky went on hunger strike. In the\nface of growing international concern, the\nSoviet government realised that he could not\nbe allowed to die. In the effort to help him\nregain his appetite, the prison guards tied him\nup, beat him nearly uns conscious, forcefully\npried his mouth open, and pushed food down\nhis throat. This process caused wounds and\nlacerations, which would not heal in his\ncondition, causing him unbearable pain. '\nWe, in the free world, must do what little\nwe can do to help him, and other victims of\noppression behind the iron curtain. His wife\nAvital has spoken on his behalf all over the\nworld. She has had audiences with our Prime\nMinister and with foreign ministers from\nmany countries, in June 1982 she received\nthe British All Party Parliamentary Award\nfor Soviet Jewry.\nAnatoly Shcharansky will be the subject of\nthe SCC Human Rights motion on Tuesday\nat the UGM. On Wednesday, Vivian Bendall\nwill be talking to the Conservative Society at\n1:00pm, Huxley 340. We shall try to collect a petition on his behalf. You will be able to see\nus, and answer questions at our stall on\nThursday.\nNCCL\nMost people living in Britain consider this\ncountry to be one where people are relatively\nfree, the police are humane and the laws are\nfair. Most people would be amazed to hear\nthat Human Rights is an active concern here.\nThe watchdog for human rights is the\nNational Council for Civil Liberties. Amnesty\nInternational will only intervene in cases\nwhere someone has been imprisoned for his\nviews alone, without using or advocating\nviolence. NCCL campaigns include Data\nProtection, Equal Pay, Capital Punishment,\nRubber and Plastic Bullets, Illegal acts by the\nPolice and Gay Rights. There is also a vast\namount of NCCL literature on all aspects of\nHuman Rights, which is all very reasonably\npriced.\nNCCL has a small full time staff in London\nand a network of local groups throughout the\ncountry. Subscriptions and donations fund\nall NCCL operations. Membership is \u00a37.00\nfor students, and members receive the\nnewspaper Rights quarterly. NCCL is the\nonly permanent and independent organisation in Britain working to protect and extend\nyour civil liberties. It urgently requires the\nhelp and support of everyone who can give it.\nFor more details write to NCCL, 21 Tabard\nStreet, London SE1 4LA. FELIX Friday, 2 December, 1983\nI Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Continuing\nInjustices\nDear Pallab\nI would like to draw people's attention to the continuing\ninjustices, first exposed by\nFELIX on 4 November.\nIf people read further than\nthe sensational headline\n'Violence at Union Party', they\nwill know I refer to the ban\nimposed on the Latin American\nSociety (LAS) from the holding\nof events on Union premises.\nIn informing LAS of the ban,\nICU Deputy President Miss\nChristine Teller attempts to\njustify her immediate action to\nthe incident: T can only assume\nthat nobody from the society\nstepped in to try to prevent or\nstop it.'\nShe is correct only in her\nchoice of words, in that\nanybody not pre ser it at the time\n'can only assume'.\nAs FELIX made clear, LAS\nmembers did restrain the\nperson concerned (with little\nhelp fr m the security guards)\nand in fact did call the police.\nEven though LAS have been\ntold it is 'responsible for the\nconduct of people at the event',\nthe person concerned had\nalready left the party. It is\nhighly unreasonable if not\nridiculous to hold LAS responsible for any activities in\nthe ladies toilets!\nDespite the publicity\nafforded in FELIX, as far as I know, little has changed. That\nis except the justification of the\nban. Now Miss Teller 'can only\nassume' that the atmosphere at\nthe party must have been\nconducive to violent behaviour.\nI have no need to resort to\nassumptions. I can state as fact\nthat the party atmosphere was\none of the friendliest I have\nexperienced.\nThe unfairness of the ban is\nplain to see, crippling a society\nof which the culprit is not even a member. He is an IC student so\nthe ban is wholly ineffective in\nthat it does nothing to stop the\nrecurrence of such incidents by\nindividuals.\nIt is about time Miss Teller\ndisplayed some integrity in\ndealing with such problems.\nSurely there is a fairer, more\neffective action than the finding\nof a scapegoat.\nYours, in solidarity with the\nLatin American Society,\nJohn Sattaur\nPhysics 3\nRanting\nOn\nDear Pallab\nThis year FELIX is playing a large part in the public ising of\nHuman Rights Week. I hope that\nyou will acknowledge your\nresponsibility to help prevent this\noccasion being hijacked for\npolitical purposes. There always\nplenty of left-wing societies\nprepared to rant on about South\nAfrica, Chile, South Africa\nIt is unfortunate that an ugly,\nanti-American feeling currently\nprevalent amongst extreme left\nactivists, is becoming more and\nmore trendy and acceptable.\nThese people carefully overlook\nthe fact that by far the worst\nviolations of human rights occur\nbehind the iron curtain. It is\nparticularly notable that C ND have staked their dubious claim\nto represent Human Rights\ncauses. If this type of thing is\nallowed to go on, perhaps Sci Fi\nSoc will have a campaign. Will\nthey betray their home planet in\nthe same way as CND betray the\nfree world? Finally, I must warn\nyou to beware of seemingly\ninnocuous societies such as Veg\nSoc, which are actually fronts for\nCommunists, animal lovers,\ncorrupt Union officials, etc, none\nof whom care about human\nrights at all.\nYours sincerely\nJonathan Gerson\nRag Week\nBlues\nDear FELIX\nWould someone please tell\nme when Rag Week starts? I know it's on as I 've seen posters\nsaying which day but very few\nsaying where or when.\nAlso, whilst on the subject of\nthe lack of communication, I have only seen one person\nadvertising any event, the RCS\nSmoking Concert ticket seller,\nbut up until then I thought that\na Smoking Concert was where\npeople played tunes like the\nStuyvesant Blues.\nSurely it wouldn't take much\neffort to organise groups of\npeople within each C CU to\nadvertise and whip up support\nfor the Rag Week events. You\ncould use the existing structure\nof year reps, print accurate\ndetails in FELIX, etc.\nC 'mon, this College has great\npotential, harness it.\nYours d is grunted ly Dave Pearce\nMining 1\nBlatantly\nStilted\nDear Pallab\nI notice that the pornography\nissue is a regular theme on your\nletters page. Each time I read a letter I get more and more\nangry. 'Whilst not being the\nmost precise user of the English\nlanguage myself, even I can spot\nthe blatant abuse of it when\nused in letters concerning\npornography; and even in\nFELIX's reporting of it.\nI refer of course to the phrase\n'Mines Block Vote'. The term\n'block vote' refers to the voting\npower of a number of\nindividuals as used by a single\nrepresentative on their behalf.\nIf the voting at aUG M was\ndone only by the CCUs on\nbehalf of their members, then\nMr Crownshaw's vote would be\na 'block vote'; it is not and the\nvotes of RSMU individuals seen\nat U GM is not either. It has\nbeen the case that individuals of\nthe RSMU have been willing to\nturn up to cast their individual\nvote at UGMs. It has been the\neffect of defeating the anti-pornography motions, countless times, which has led\nsupporters of these motions to\nseek a derogatory term of\nreference to account for these\nprevious defeats. The use of the\nterm has been in an effort to\ndiminish the validity of the\nopinions of those who oppose\nanti-pornographers. Where will\nthese stop in their blatantly\nstilted propaganda and\nopinions.\nFor the sake of brevity I will\navoid discussing at length the\nsudden change in attitudes that\nhas occured: previous U GM votes did not represent the view\nof the majority (on at least 5\ntimes): the last U GM vote was\nrepresentative?\nYours in sea rh of honest\nS Bishop (for Adrian James)\nSlug (for whoever)\nPresident C& GU 82/3 (because\nI wish it to be known that not all\nC& GU Presidents suffer from\nhair loss or wear pink dresses)\nMoscow\nMouthpiece\nDear Sir\nI wish to draw your attention\nto the fact that certain teachers\nmay be allowing their political\npersuasions to interfere with the\nmarks they give to students.\nI am currently seconded from\nthe RAF to do a computing\ncourse at this College.

    "content": "Faulty Fremantle\nThe details of the Fremantle story are still not clear. The Union are ref j sing to comment so all we have is Andy Walker's side of the story. He claims that\nMichael Arthur told Gaynor to get rid of him because he was doing too good\na job of trying to improve conditions at the Fremantle.\nMuch as I would like to believe Andy Walker's story his account doesn't really hold water. Undoubtedly the friction between himself and Michael\nArthur had a large part to play in his departure. However he was probably\nasked to leave over an incident which we will probably never find out about.\nAndy Walker's allegations against Michael Arthur may just be sour grapes\nbut nevertheless dp bear some examination.\nAs Warden of the Fremantle, Andy Walker certainly has been banging his\nhead against a brick wall when dealing with Michael Arthur. For all his faults\nas Warden, Andy Walker has genuinely been concerned about the condition\nof the Fremantle to the extent of calling in surveyors behind Michael Arthur's back and leaking stories to FELIX.\nPart of Michael Arthur's job is to obtain and fill as many new residences as\npossible and he will react strongly against any moves to have any of the\nrooms closed on the grounds that they are uninhabitable. Michael Arthur\nmay be arrogant and may run head tenancies like the Gestapo but he does\nhave a problem in that he has two contradictory jobs. On the one hand he has\nto act as the College landlord, which entails filling rooms, collecting money\nand, in extreme cases, evicting people. On the other hand, he is in charge of\nthe Union's Welfare Service, attempting to improve conditions for students\nand help them with any legal problems they may have (including hassles with\nlandlords).\nIn light of the constant problems students have had with Michael Arthur,\nnot only this year but ever since jie became a College employee, the Union\nshould think about dividing the two jobs completely. There is quite clearly a conflict of interests. Let College employ someone to deal with the running of\nstudent residences while the Union employ someone (preferably not Michael\nArthur) to deal with student welfare independent of College.\nFELIX\nThere will not be a FELIX next Friday. There will be a special Christmas\nissue on the following Wednesday. Any help in collating on Monday evening\n(8:00pm) will be much appreciated. From now on there will be a new policy in\npublishing articles and adverts. Priority will be given to those clubs which\nsupply people to collate (usually done 9:00pm Thursday evenings).\nIf you have got a FELIX then count yourself lucky.

    "content": "By\nJuvenal\nIt was a quiet morning in Cheapskate, with\nthe Baron still absent since he was being\nwined and dined by the neighbouring rulers.\nThe citizens were hard at toil for over an\nhour. The large kettles in Surefield were\nbeing filled in preparation for the morning's drinking. And in the citizens office, the\nPresident-Gormless Layon\u2014was having difficulty with her knitting.\n'Damn, I 've dropped another stitch,' she\nwailed. 'If only The Witch was here. Pristine is\nso much better at knitting than I am, she's doing everything else for me, I'm sure she'd do my knitting too.'\nIt was at the very moment that this thought\nran through Gormless' mind that the\nBitch\u2014whoops\u2014Witch of Southside rode in\non her broomstick. She rested against a large, locked cupboard that took up so much\nof the room ' n the cramped office and mused,\nas she did every morning, why it was that she\ndid not get a citizen's permit to park like all\nthe other of the citizens re pre se natives. 'Don't leave it there, darling,' cried Mrs\nJolly Hockey-Sticks, 'it'll stop us get ing at the\ndrinks.'\n'Don't mention such potions,' wailed The\nWitch, as she rested her head upon her large,\nnewly purchased desk.\n'Why ever not,' replied Mrs Sticks,\noffended by the snap ish reply she had\nreceived.\n'I was drinking with the citizens last night,'\nsaid the Witch as she slowly rubbed her\naching forehead.\n'You should stick to sherry, dear, you\nnever get a hangover after drinking that,' said\nMrs Hockey Sticks who was an expert on\nsuch matters.\nBut the mention of sherry not only affect\nthe Bitch. Sawnoff Levis also paled at its\nmention. He had so looked forward to\nworking under two women, even if one of\nthem was gorm less and the other looked like\na horse. But their perpetual desire for the\nFELIX]\nlucrative pickings of their jobs, for the\nBaron's feasts where they foolishly agreed to\nso many of John Secretary's wishes, and,\nmost of all, their desire for the evil brew,\nsherry, perter bed him.\n'If it was Guinness, I might think\ndifferently,' he mumbled, 'but what all those\ngroat s that have been spent, wasted'. Indeed,\nonly recently had Mrs Sticks purchased a new stock while pretending it was for the\nparty at which all the citizens representatives\nwere entertained.\nBut the citizens Office was not the only part\nof the Baron's kingdom that was troubled. In\na room, discreetly tucked away on a remote\npart of the land, Dong Lark, the Baron's Secretary of Estates, was having difficulty\ncompleting his crossword when his identical\ntwin and deputy, Headbang Cameroon Lark,\nappeared at the door being a fearful\nexpression.\n'Expenditure of energy, four letters long,'\nmumbled Dong staring, perplexed at the\npuzzle.\n'Work,' replied Headbang pleased with the\nspeed of his thought.\n'Never heard of the word,' snapped Dong.\nHeadbang frowned, confused by his\nmaster's reply. He coughed, cleared his\nthroat, closed his eyes and prepared to\ndeliver the bad news.\n'Something has come up,' he said\nnervously.\n'Then put some scaffolding around it,'\nreplied Dong still concentrating on his\npuzzle.\n'It is about the Citizens' Electrical\nBuilding , said Headbang anxiously.\n'What of it?' asked Dong raising his head\nfrom the page for the first time.\n'It is crumbling\u2014it's very foundations are\nweakening by the hour and it will soon\ncollapse completely,' wailed Headbang.\n'How did you find this out?' screamed\nDong furious that his peaceful morning's effort on the crossword has been so\ndisturbed with such trivial news.\n'Two of my menials were sent to carry out\nurgent repairs to the Baron's castle. Lady\nMarigold has complained that the new paving\nstones were the wrong colour. But they went\nto the Electrical Building instead and while\ndrinking there some plaster fell on their\nheads. The whole place is crumbling,' wailed\nHeadbang.\nThis sort of thing wouldn't happen if you\ndidn't keep sending menials out will-n illy. We\nmust always be selective about what we do.\nOtherwise we'd be mending things all over\nthe place.'\n'It wasn't my fault,' said Headbang, sulking,\n'I didn't know that they couldn't follow my\ninstructions. What are we going to do?'\n'Do?' replied Dong, surprised by the\nquestion. 'We'll do what we always do:\nnothing.'\n\u2022 \u2022 Hi Friday, 2 December, 1983 WOMB\nBEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS\nThe Sherfield Mole\n\u2022 Wallowing in a trough\n(or the Council Sherry Party)\nEach year the members of Council engage\nCollege Administration in a lively contest on\nhome ground in the Union Upper Lounge. I had arrived early to have a glimpse of the\nAdmin side in training. Team manager\n'Honest' John Smith fielded a surprise team\nwhose leading members were Fred\nHollingshead (fly-half), John Davidson\n(hooker), Hermitage and Tavener (full\nbacks) and Lloyd-Davies (full-up). John\nSmith refused to divulge any details\nconcerning his mystery \u00a325,000 new signing\nto fill the difficult position of Services\nManager.\nWhile the training continued I mingled in\nthe directors box with Lady Flowers and\nCollege Archivist Mrs Pingree. The shrill\ndoyen of level 4 provided me with expert\nknowledge of this fine sport.\nHowever, our attention was distracted by\nMrs Hardy-Smith intoning Jolly Hockey\nSticks, the traditional starting signal with a quick break a pass went from Hermitage to\nHollingshead, Lloyd-Davies overlapped\nbrilliantly and went for the line. He placed his\nglass on the table with panache and after\nbeing refilled converted with a quick twitch of\nhis wrist. Thus after only two minutes Admin\nled by two sherries to nil. The rest of the first\nhalf was mostly positional play with Tavener\ndominating till he could no longer continue\nafter his personal total exceeded twenty-six.\nHe was carried off the field by stretcher with\nno discern able signs of agony. The IC\nfight back was led by play coach Gaynor\nLewis and half-wit Ian Bull. Though I do feel\nthat the tactic of a joint scrum didn't pay off.\nAt half time both teams were sponged\ndown with avocado dip and much ed celery.\nThe second half with both teams beginning to\nfall over and talk to tables. Only Lloyd-Davies\ncontinued bringing his fine liver into play. But\nit was not needed as Admin romped home 12\ncases to 4. Mrs Hardy-Smith secreting the 24\ncases left over in the Union sherry cabinet.\nI have since heard that ICU are thinking of\nreplacing their te ram manager. Miss Lewis\nwas too plastered to comment.\nPage 5\n\n"

    "content": "Allom Cup Regatta\nThe Allom Cup Regatta for UL colleges was\nheld last Saturday on the Thames at\nChiswick. The major success of the day was\nthe Women's Novice Four who won their first\never event. Having spent all last year training\nand racing enthusiastically, they finally put\neverything together when it mattered and\ncruised to victory in every round.\nThe men's first novice eight won one race\nbut were beaten in the second round. The\nsecond eight had difficulties when one\noarsmen fell off his seat and lost in their first\nrace.\nNovice Sculler Andy Wright and the pair\nSteinlechner and Bowden lost to members of\nthe ULBC squad.\nVesta Winter Regatta\nBack at Putney the first VIII was competing\nin Elite B VIII's at Vesta Winter Regatta over\na1,000m course. In the first round IC beat\nVesta RC by 1 '/4 lengths despite having lost '/2\nlength on the start due to the some dustbins\ns tearing by the cox Harrison.\nIn the final against Thames RC the cox did\nit again nearly losing the race by taking the\nMiddlesex bend far too wide. Fortunately\nstroke man Downing had other ideas and the\neight sprinted in to win by 3 feet\u2014a bit too\nclose for comfort.\nSecretary's Report:\nThe Bowling Club A team again proved the\nstaying power of IC when they made their\nannual trip to Birmingham for the gruelling\n12-hour marathon. After 22 games, they were\npleasantly surprised to find that they had\nbeaten two teams from traditional rivals\nBrunei. Individiual accolades go to Yoga\nShan for placing well in a very strong field\nfrom all over England. The highlight of the\nrip, however, was during the return leg, when\nour captain, Mark Stanley, scored well; the\nexhausted opposition putting up only token\nresist en ce. On Wednesday 23 November a rather\ndepleted team travelled to Shooters Hill for\nthe third London Colleges League Race.\nAfter the first two races IC was first in the first\ndivison and fourth in the second division.\nDue to some missing runners, the remainder\nhad to fight to maintain these positions. It\nwas a cold day and the course very hilly,\nwhich seemed to suit Jon Lea because he\nfinished 13th out of about 170 runners.\nHowever, the other pitiful souls either tired\nfrom weekend races or fighting injury ran less\nwell. Still, it seems lady luck is on our side\n] because our closest rivals were missing a team\nmember, so rumour has it. Next term there\nare two more LCL races which we would like\nto win so we could do with some support.\nThe next race is tomorrow at Leeds, where\nlast year we won some beer for travelling so\nfar. If you fancy running its not too late to\nsign up\u2014see the not icc board at the bottom of\nthe stairs in the Union Building.\nIC 2nd XV vs Saracens 1st C) XV\nWon 6-0\nFifteen corpses eventually showed up on\nSaturday morning (after having an average\nfour hours sleep) and followed Mark Hudson\non to the pitch; his bleached locks the only\nobject which could be focused on through\nbloodshot eyes. IC seemed to shake off their\nhangovers in the first ten minutes and had\nstormed ahead by the end of the first quarter\nwith two lok ng( but straight) penalties by M Hudson. IC dominated the rest of the first\nhalf but failed to improve the points tally due\nin the main to a novel interpretation of the\nlaws by the referee.\n\"\u00bbIn the second half it was the same old story\nof club sides forwards dominating due to\nsuperior strength and size. In the last 20\nminutes Saracens had a succession of five\nyard penalties but ferocious tackling by IC\nprevented them from scoring. Then to the\nrelief of everyone the final whistle signalled\nanother win for Hudson's heroes all of whom\nproceeded to die in the changing rooms.\nIC 1st XV17 Saracens 10\nDave McGee's men looked tired and\ndishevelled. Battle-weary and exhausted,\nhardly able to summon an ounce of strength\nto over-worked muscles. Yes, the Carnival\nhad certainly taken it out of the team when we\nmet on Saturday morning!\nDespite muscular opposition to physical\nexertion (known as the Mark Hipsey\nSyndrome), we set about our task with much\nfire, determination and many Medisport pep\npills. The first setback came when the ref\nawarded them a penalty, the first of many\n(ahem) interesting decisions. Undaunted, our\nreply was swift, when a bouncing ball was\nquickly snaffled up by Mark (Baby Face)\nHassle to score in the corner. The 'Sarrys'\nquickly replied with a try and penalty to take\nthe lead.\nA penalty (yes, we WERE given one) pulled\nus within one point and it stayed this way\nuntil the last ten minutes, when Mark (not\nRotten Row again! Hipsey linked with a fine\nrun from 'Daddy' Davies, to score in the\ncorner. The game was sealed in the last few\nminutes when Paul (Greased Lightning)\nSeccombe left us (and the ref) to cheer him on\nas he kicked up the line and fell over onto the\nball.\nCharlie (Why does everyone pick on me?)\nDe Rohan was the victim of a vicious and\nunprovoked attack, but all in all it was a fine\nrevenge for last week'st on king at Blackheat\nDust Bowl.\nJust when you thought it was safe to go\nback onto the rugby pitch, there came a more\nterrifying and hideous danger\u2014ICRFC.\nIC v Borough Road 67-64\n| After annihilating Hackney College 97-21 in\na friendly match we ventured out to Isleworth\nto take on the most consistent team in the\nleague who hadn't lost in God knows how\nlong.\nThey opened the soc ring but soon realised\nI we were not going to submit easily. It took\nseven minutes for us to push ahead, and from\nthen on we never looked back.\nAnother Scott Brodrick American special\nright on half time gave us a six point lead, and\nthe first five minutes of the second half saw\npossibly the best basketball an Imperial\nCollege team has ever produced when we\nsteamrollered to a16 point lead.\nThe game looked sealed but it was from it.\nBorough Road ground down our lead until it\nlooked as if we had blown it when they were\none point behind, with possession and 50\nseconds to play. But a tight defense and a calm basket from the Iceman Ken Jarret\nbrought about our historic victory.\nCredit must be given to our coach 'H' who\nheld the team together when the pressure was\non.\nWater\nSki 1\n1\n1\n' On Sunday 7 December we will be launching\nour new boat onto the Thames at Bayswater.\nThanks are extended to the Canoe Club for\ntheir generous loan and help with modi fic a tion.

    "content": "ff SP il OF II ERIAL COLLEGE UI\nFREMANTLE THE FULL STORY Andrew Walker, Warden of the Fremantle Hotel head tenancy,\nhas resigned in mysterious circumstances. It seems that he was\nasked to resign by Union President Gaynor Lewis after she had\nreceived complaints involving Mr Walker. However Miss Lewis\nclaims that no pressure was brought on Mr Walker to resign.\nMichael Arthur\nDetails of the incidents have\nnot been released, however\nsources close to Mr Walker claim\nhe has been forced out because of\nhis criticism of the failure of\nStudent Services Officer Mr\nMichael Arthur to ensure that\nmajor repairs were carried out on\nthe Hotel. It is also claimed that\nMichael Arthur had adopted a blas e attitude to the problems at\nthe Fremantle and has been\nprepared to let unfit rooms at an\nexorbitant rent.\nHowever, Mr Arthur denies\nthat he has been instrumental in\nforcing Mr Walker's resignation,\nor that Mr Walker has been\nsacked for his performance as a Warden.\nThe Fremantle Hotel was\nacquired shortly before the start\nof the 1982/3 session. Mr WaUcer\nwas invited to take on the\nWardenship at very short notice\nby Michael Arthur since there\nwas no time to use the normal\nprocedure for appointments.\nRight from the start there were\nproblems with water leaking into\nmany rooms through the roof.\nSome repairs were carried out,\nbut these proved to be\ninadequate. In addition there\nwere problems in running the\nAndrew Walker\nhotel caused by personal friction\nbetween Mr Walker and the then\nsub warden Gary Turner. Mr\nTurner, an employee of the\nStudent Services Office, was also\nappointed by Michael Arthur at\nvery short notice, despite not\nbeing a student. Mr Turner\nquickly developed a strong\ndislike for Mr Walker and was\nfrequently to be found in the\nFremantle Bar boasting to\nFremantle residents that he was\nin charge and that he did not take\nany notice of Mr Walker. This\ncontributed to the situation\nwhere Mr Walker commanded\nlittle respect amongst the\nresidents and had trouble\nmaintaining discipline, particularly in the bar which was\nfrequently kept open by Mr\nTurner until the small hours of\nthe morning. Mr Walker's position was further undermined\nby the fact that a frequent\nparticipant in these late night\ndrinking sessions was Michael\nArthur himself.\nAt the end of the spring term\nlast session it became apparent\nthat either Mr Walker or Mr\nTurner would have to leave the\nFremantle. Michael Arthur\n(Continued on Page 3.)\nBomb Scare!\nReeves Saves The Day\nIn an incredible attempt to stop\ncomplaints from Mews residents,\nGeoffrey Reeves, College Security\nOfficer, placed a bomb in Princes\nGate Mews on Monday morning.\nSuspicion was first aroused\nwhen a parcel arrived at the\nSouthside messengers' desk\naddressed to Tizard Hall\u2014and\nthe parcel had no name on it! The\nstunned messenger, Patrick Ng,\nwas the first to see the parcel. He\ncalled in housekeeper Kate\nMcPherson who started to open\nthe box. And the first thing she saw\ninside was electrical wiring!\nThe horrified housekeeper\ncalled in Chief Security Officer\nReeves who rushed to the scene\nwith a long stick and his favourite\nwalk ie talk ie. Patrick Ng ran\nthrough the bar shouting 'It's a bomb, it's a bomb,' but no one\nbelieved him! Eventually the\nwhole of Southside was.\nevacuated and the Bomb Squad\nsummoned as Mr Reeves\nprodded the bomb with his stick.\nHis suspicions were aroused\nwhen he peered into the box\ninside the parcel. He decided it\nmust be removed from College\npremises and so, showing great\ncourage and disregard for\npersonal safety, he carried it\ndown the steps into the Mews.\nWhen it was suggested that he\nhad acted very bravely, he smiled\nmodestly and said it was only\npart of his job.\nThe Mews residents were not\nevacuated. Mr Reeves said that\nthe walls of Mews buildings\nwould contain the blast.\nThe Bomb Squad arrived and\napproached the bomb in the\nsealed off area. They were about\nto make it safe when a Tizard\nHall resident returning for lunch\nenquired about the guitar echo\nunit kit which he was expecting\nby mail order. He was shocked to\ndiscover the Bomb Squad\ninvestigating his mail. One quick\nexplanation later the kit was\ndelivered to its rightful owner.\nStudents returned to their\nlukewarm lunches, the Bomb\nSquad were sent home and\nGeoffrey Reeves rode off into the\nsunset.\n'The Bomb' and (Inset) Hero Geoffrey Reeves\nNo. 660 II Felix, 2 December, 19831 Free!\n\n"

The heroic Sports Editor,\nmeanwhile, was persuading his mate, John,\nwho hadn't played for seven years, to turn\nout.\nWith IC deep in the shit, the cavalry arrived\nand promptly lost their first two games! Their\nsecond game, however, inspired the team to\ngreat heights of brilliance, as they came\nwithin an ace of beating UC's first team's best\npair.\nAt this stage, IC were 4-2 down, but an\ninspired team clawed their way back into the\ngame, winning all their last three games\ndespite being miles behind in all three.\nAfterwards, a jubilant team celebrated in\n'the Sun', which ended up with Phil trying to\nlie down on the tracks, and later puking on\nthe tube, and John (no, not me!) causing great\nembarrassment to a girl called Yvonne who\nturned out to be from Tizard staircase 4!\nWhat a small world.

They hadn't reckoned on the underhand nature of our\nclub however. Careful team selection meant\nthat three first team players were eligible to\nplay, as well as one other second team er. The\nlook on the once confident St Georges faces\n. as shuttles flew past (and into) their ears with\nawesome power, was a joy to behold, as was\nthe curry we had afterwards.\nAs a matter of fact, our normal third team\nwould have thrashed them, so it wasn't really\nworth the fuss.\nThe Chess Club have chickened out of then\nchallenge darts match against us. As I have\nalready branded them as Horlicks Drinkers, I shall have to go really over the top and\ndenounce them as listeners to Peter Powell! If\nthat doesn't provoke them, nothing will.\nNo badminton tonight, next Monday or next\nFriday. Still, never mind, there's always the\nClub meal, Thurs 8th Dec.

Both teams fielded members of the\nnational squad (Gordon 'Ton' Bowser is still\nawaiting selection), so obviously there was\ngoing to be some first class shooting on\ndisplay.\nGeoff Kolbe (IC) opened with 197, other\nmembers of ICRPC weren't quite up to this\n\u2022 standard, but Tom Figgs and Gordon (Club\nCaptain, contact via Elec Eng letter-racks)\nboth shot 194. Other scores for IC were A Hamilton 192.5, S Harrison 191, and club\nalcoholic G Jones 183 (not counted).\nMatthew Guille (kings) showed himself up by\nshooting 197 after telling everyone he would\nget 200. The rest were below the standard we\nnormally expect from Kings (ie crap).\nForthcoming attractions: club handicap\nknockout\u2014Steve will buy a pint for the\nperson who knocks Huggs out in the first\nround.

Barry Tuzio and Bob Dhillon had\nan excellent game leaving keeper, Paul\nSimpson, with little to do.\nThe midfield quartet of 'Biggies' Brady,\n'Chopper' Wadsowrth, 'Skin' Johnson and\nDavid Hardy held a very strong RSM\nmidfield by sheer industry and commitment.\nFive minutes into the second half, IC\nreturned some of the RSM pressure leading to\na Steve Rimmer corner being slammed home\nby the om in present Tony Wilkinson. In the\nfinal stages of the game Steve Rimmer and\nJim Downing gave the RSM defence a lot of\ntrouble and both were lucky not to score.\nAt the end of the day, clich es aside, both\nsides are to be congratulated on an excellent\ngame of football with the 1-1 score line reflecting a well-balanced match.\n'Roving Raconteur' David Hardy\n{Friday, 2 December, 19831 \\FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Frcmantlc Feud\nContinued from front page\nevidently decided that Mr Walker\nshould stay on and persuaded Mr\nTurner to take the appointment\nas Manager of the head tenancies\nat 6 and 8 Earl's Court Square.\n(The problems being encountered at this head tenancy were\nhighlighted in FELIX three\nweeks ago.)\nDuring the long vacation the\nSummer Letting Scheme at the\nFremantle was run by Andrew\nBarron along with some\nassistants. He and Mr Walker\nwere both concerned with the\ncondition of the Fremantle,\nparticularly the leaking roof. The\nfire precautions were also of\nconcern and Mr Barron called in\nthe Fire Inspectors who criticised\nthe condition of many fire\nextinguishers and other\nequipment. Mr Barron was given\na stern dressing down by Michael\nArthur for going behind his back\nin this way. Apparently no\nimprovements have been made in\nfire equipment and several light\nfittings on the corridor on the top\nfloor have had water leaking into\nthem and have shorted causing\nsmoke and scorch marks on the\nceiling.\nThe body in College\nresponsible for assessing the state\nof buildings, including head\ntenancies, is the Estates\ndepartment. They surveyed the\nbuilding before it was taken on\ninitially and failed to discover\nany serious problems despite the\nfact that the roof was clearly\nfaulty at the time.\nIt seems that Mr Walker is not\njustified in blaming Michael\nArthur for the lack of progress in\nthe repairs since this is Estates'\nresp on sib lit y. It appears that Mr\nWalker has developed a strong\ndislike of Michael Arthur and\nthis may be colouring his\njudgement on the issue.\nMr Walker an tag on is ed Mr\nArthur earlier this term when he\ngave FELIX details of the\nstructural problems at the\nFremantle and blamed Mr\nArthur, rather than Estates, for\nthe situation. Mr Walker's allegations of an un justifiably high rent increase have more\nfoundation. Fremantle rents\nwent up nearly 10% this year\ncompared to only 4% in halls of\nresidences. It seems that this is\nonly partly due to the increase\npaid to the landlords, the rest\nbeing due to revised estimates of\nsummer letting s income and the\nincreased number of rooms being\nused by the Warden and\nSubwardens. Rents in the\nFremantle are now quite high\ncompared with other head\ntenancies.\nIt appears whilst Mr Walker\nhas been concerned with the lack\nof progress in repairs to the\nFremantle he has not been very\nsuccessful as a Warden. He is not\npopular amongst this year's new\nresidents (who know nothing\nabout last year's animosity),\nmost of whom have hardly met\nhim and were apathetic towards\nhis performance when interviewed by FELIX. It seems he\nhas few supporters either\namongst the residents or the\nsub wardens at the Fremantle and\nplays little part in the Hotel's social life. His attempts to whip\nup support for him to stay on as\nWarden have met with little\nAbsolute Power\nTeller Told Off\nChristine Teller, Union Deputy\nPresident, criticised Union\nDisciplinary procedure last night\nfor not allowing her sufficient\npower to discipline students as-she feels fit.\nWhen a meeting of the appeals\ncommittee yesterday unanimously overturned her ruling against\nthe Latin-American Society\nearlier this term Miss Teller\nremained adamant that she had\ndone the right thing. Both in\nfining the society \u00a350 and later\nbanning them from the use of the\nUnion rooms it was ruled that\nMiss Teller had exceeded her\nbrief as Deputy President.\nReaders of FELIX will know\nabout the incident resulting in the\nappeal, and how a student\nuninvolved in the LAS disrupted\na party earlier this term.\nResponsibility for disciplining\nthis student has now been passed\nto the Exec. Christine Teller took\nthe decision of the appeals\ncommittee very badly and\nrefused to deal with LAS\nincidents alone in the future.\nExec Split!\nIC Union Hon Sec Sean Davis is\nabsolutely fed up with the large\nnumber of conferences, parties\nand boos e ups enjoyed by the\nsabbaticals and their friends at\nthe Union's expense.\nA motion at next week'sU GM is aimed at stopping the latest\nfreebie organised by Council. As\nthree representatives prepare to\ngo to Blackpool for a free\nweekend at the NUS Conference,\none of them, RCS President Eric\nDarbyshire will be joining Sean\nDavis in his opposition to the\ntrip. While addressing itself to the\nNUS conference in particular, the\nmotion is concerned with a much\nwider issue asking for the whole\nprocess of sending people to and\nspending money on these\nconferences to be reviewed.\nThe Union spends in total\nabout \u00a32,000 each year on\nsending people on conferences.\nThe Union representatives are\nnormally sabbaticals and their\nvalue to the Union is\nquestionable. The prime example\nof this is the INCOST Conference\nin Finland planned for next year.\nINCOST is an International\nConference of Students of\nTechnology, inviting representatives from student unions all\nover the world to a week of\nparties and tourist visits in a foreign country. Last year's conference in Delft had only ten\ndelegates in total, two of them\nbeing from IC, the only British\ncollege prepared to spend \u00a3800\non such an event. As expected\nStephen Goulder had a thoroughly good time but the\nonly reply from Jim Boucher (the\nother IC delegate) when asked\nwhat benefit the Union got from\nthe conference was a laconic\n'none'.\nBare Faced Cheek\nBalloon Dancers at the RCS Smoking Concert\nThe RCS Smoking Concert\nturned out to be an extraordinary\nassembly of impress a rios and\nraving lunatics.\nThe winners of the much\ncoveted Smoking Concert Oscar,\ndesigned in the shape of a full\nwhisky bottle, were the newly\nformed rock group the LTmp\nMembers, who in their debut\nconcert performed a number of\nclassic songs with revised lyrics.\nThe numbers including 'Take a Walk around Southside',\n'Leprosy Blues' and 'Bald Thing'\n(previously recorded under the\ntitle 'Wild Thing') in which Mike\nStuart, Guilds President,\nappeared in his blue dress.\nGuilds Carnival last Friday\nturned out to be a lively finale to\nRag Week, as expected. The\npopular combination of bands,\ndiscos and films was a great\ncrowd-puller and the event was\neasily the best attended of the\nweek.\nCarnival looks like making a profit this year; it was estimated\nthat the event had paid for itself\nby two o 'clock Saturday\nmorning.\nThe One Million and One Down\nDarts competition in Southside\nBar between two teams from\nRCS departments ended just in\ntime for first lecture on Monday\nmorning after 63 hours. The\nwinning team was from Maths\nand Physics, with their\nopponents from Chemistry and\nLife Sciences giving up an hour\nearlier after realising they were\ntoo far behind to win.\nFELIX Friday, 2 December, 19831 [Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "'Pack of Lies' by Hugh Whitemore, at the\nLyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue.\nBased on a true incident, Pack of Lies is\nthe story of Bob and Barbara Jackson, a middle-aged couple leading a contented, if\nun ambitious life in Ruislip. Until one day\nwithout warning, a gentleman from Whitehall\ncalls, the enigmatic Stewart. He informs\nthem that their neighbours may be harbouring a spy, and that he needs their front\nbedroom for surveillance purposes\u2014just for\na few days. Reluctantly, the Jacksons\nagree\u2014a decision that will cost them their\nhappiness and ultimately, it is suggested,\ncaused the untimely death of Barbara.\nFor the neighbours, are not just anyone,\nbut are Peter and Helen, the Jacksons'\nclosest friends, outwardly a warm-hearted,\ngenerous Canadian couple. And when\nStewart's girl-agents move in, and the 'few\ndays' stretch into weeks, and then months\nBarbara comes under increasing strain,\nequating her betrayal of her friends, with\ntheir betrayal of the country.\nJudi Dench as Barbara, changes from a comfortably settled housewife, into a ner-vous, twitching wreck. Hurt at being\ndeceived by those whom she trusted, she\nbecomes increasingly withdrawn. She clams\nup with Stewart (Richard Vernon), the\nSecret Service man, who soothes with\nreassuring, but such manipulative courtesy;\nand becomes tense with her husband\n(Michael Willilams) w tio stands impotently\nby, smiling hollowly, obviously trying to 'put a brave face on things'. Only sometimes does'\nthe pain show, as when having a terrifying\nrow with her daughter, she screams 'I 'll never\nbe able to trust you again!'\nFor Stewart, with his out-of-place references to 'family silver', and Thelma and Sally,\nhis coolly competent agents (pla'ye d very\nmuch in the glam 60s Avengers style by\nElizabeth Bell and Penny Ryder), it's just\nanother mopping-up job. They're not too-concerned about the well-being of the\nJackson family, they just want a successful\ntask, smoothly accomplished, overlooking\nthe personal effects that their operations\nmight have.\nPack of Lies is a fine, sensitively judged\nnew play by Hugh Whitemore\u2014a worthy\nsuccessor to his successful Steuie.\nFELixBHinHHHHHI\nTheatre\n'The Unknown Soldier and His Wife' by\nPeter Ustinov, produced by Dramsoc.\nA gentle satire on the ways of war and men\nThe Unknown Solider and His Wife tells the\ntale of that unlucky combatant, whose death\nis used to glorify whichever bloody war has\njust been fought. In this play, the whole\nbusiness is made even more ludicrous, for\nnot only does the 'unknown' soldier have a wife (with the in con vi ent habit of appearing,\nnoticeably pregnant, at her husband's funeral), but also he gets killed by his own\nside.\nWe trace his story through the ages: a luckless legionary in Roman times, later\ngetting entangled in the French revolution,\nfinally emerging as a nameless citizen into a cold, totalitarian state of the future.\nThe Unknown Soldier is rather misplaced\nin his military life. He prefers speaking\npoetry to his wife (played with warm sincerity\nby Corinne Lander), to singing bawdy ballads\nwith his comrades. Here, David Simmons\ngives a fine portrayal of the dreamy sensitivity\nof this philosophical figure, who should never\nhave gone to war. He picks flowers instead of\nspying; he chats to the enemy instead of\nkilling them. Understandably this does not go\ndown well with Sergeant who then proceeds\nto flog him to death. Exit Unknown Soldier.\nBut not for long, for where there's a war,\nthere's an unknown soldier.\nThere is a wonderful wealth of chan cat ure in the play: the randy, but sanctimonious\nArchbishop always prepared to bend his\nreligious scruples to suit either himself or the\npower-hun grey General; the arrogant, know-all Rebel (determined ly at odds with\neveryone else; the (or rather,'ze') crackpot\nInventor devising ever more efficient methods of extermination.\nDramsoc have tried hard for this pro duc tion, with some good cameo performances.\nUnfortunately, some humour is lost in\nmistiming of lines. Also, at times, the stage\nhas a tendency to look cluttered, with some\nawkward exits and entrances. Of costumes\nand scenery, I know now1 \u00bb as they were not\nready for the preview performance I saw.\nOn the whole, though, The Unknown\nSoldier is well worth seeing, full of finger-poking Ustinovian fun. It will make you think\ntoo, but not so much that you cannot laugh.\nThe Unknown Soldier and His Wife takes\nplace from Wednesday 7 December to\nSaturday 10 December at 7:30pm in the\nUnion Concert Hall. Tickets are \u00a31.50,\navailable on door, or from IC Union Office.\nClaire Moss\nMayDays by David Edgar, at the\nBarbican Theatre.\nMayDays is the first production by an up\nand coming playwright to be performed by\nthe RSC for twenty-two years, and as such it\nhas been lavishly produced for the Barbican\nwith no expense spared on sets and effects.\nThe play moves from 1956 to the present\nday, telling the story of the development of\nCommunism and the Soviet State, and how\nAmerica and the Western World saw it,\nthrough the words and deeds of the politically\nstrong student youth of the time. Martin\nGlass (played by Antony Sher) is the central\ncharacter, developing from a curious public-schoolboy to a middle aged, middle class\nfather of three for whom the idea of revolution has long turned stale.\nI get the feeling that it is precisely for this\ntype of man that the play was written. Such\nfervent student activity has become an exception these days and I would readily class\nthis as a play through which the middle aged\n(now decidedly better off) can reminisce in\nthe plush surroundings of the Barbican thea-tre.\nThe play is ambitiously produced. However, the large number of scene changes,\nthough swift, still drag the play out and, along\nwith the continuous dramatic music, the production would have been more suited as a 'film or television play. Unfortunately I arrived\nlate and had to watch the first act on a tiny\ntelevision screen in which all the actors shone\nlike the Angel Gabriel. Once inside the thea-tre, I was surprised to find how swamped the\nactors were by the stage and how isolated\nand distant the individual sets could appear.\nMany props do not a stage set make, and the\nplay could easily have been produced with\nfew or no props at all.\nMayDays is hardly an evening's light en-tert a in ment, and only the politically well-versed will pick up everything first time\naround. Never mind, there is always plenty to\nlook at. I wish the play every success in\nLondon and hope it will eventually move to\nStratford Upon Avon.\nJohn Burgess\nPeter Ustinou as the Archbishop in the\noriginal production of 'The Unknown\nSoldier and his Wife'.\n{Friday, 2 December, 19831 I Page 7\n\n"
