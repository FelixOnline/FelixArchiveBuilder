    "content": "ISPORTI\nQ Sailing\nAfter a somewhat colourful party the night before, and along excursion through the\nstreets of Reading looking for\nthe river Thames, the team, in\nhigh spirits and a clear state of\nmind, finally managed to locate\nReading University Sailing Club.\nEven more problems were\nencountered by the Imperial team when trying to determine\nthe wind direction at the start of\nthe first race, leaving Reading to\nmake a fine start and keep First\nand Second places until the final\nmark. At this point, the superior\nskills of the Imperial team mastered the wind flow around\nthe two ga so meters on the river\nbank and they stormed past to\ntake the race, finishing first,\nthird and fourth.\nWith cries of \" My extension\nhas fallen off\" during the second\nleg of the final race, Dave made\na dynamic dash for the bank to\ntry and get someone to help him\nfix it. Unfortunately the Reading\nladies were not too sympathetic\nand left Dave to his own devices\n(and a screwdriver). This left\nPeter and Graham without a team mate for the rest of the\nrace. Peter made gallant efforts\nto try and slow the Reading\nboats while Graham decided\nthat the ga so meters were really\ntoo much to handle and waited\non the river bank to join in again\non the second lap. Unfortunately\nReading, still being harrassed by\nPeter \" all of them overtook me\" Howarth noticed that Graham had actually sailed one lap less\nthan they had, and left Imperial\nto concede the match.\nSquash\nls ts3U C Xls ts23r ds27, St MH2 nds2'/24 th s2 UC2 nds35 th s5Ch XH2 nds0 Overall, another satisfactory set\nof results, with more opponents\ncrumbling beneath the might of\nthe Firsts. What would have\nbeen the Firsts last match of the\nterm vs St G Hls ts has been\ncancelled, the opposition having\nwithdrawn their side from Division 1 (before it was too\nlate); our reputation continues\nto grow by the hour.\nOn the noticeboard are posted\ndetails of Squash Club jerseys,\nwhich will be ordered during\nnext week. Here also can be\nfound latest details of Squash\nClub's grand tour to Germany\nPage 22 HM HH H1 during the Easter Vac. This tour\nwill go ahead but numbers need\nto be determined now to plan\nfixtures and finances, ie please\ndecide if you're interested as\nsoon as possible. Ten Pin Bowling\nLast Saturday, the masses set off\nfor Portsmouth to do battle with\nthe local polytechnic. Again, the\npopularity of local pubs and\nfish' n' chip shops proved too\nmuch for some people, as a little\nlubrication was sought before\nthe game.\nHowever, as things got going,\nit was obvious that, as usual, the\nA team would overcome the\nopposition thanks to 500+ series\nby Michael and Andy holding\ntheir end up with a502 series but \u2022\neverybody else bowling below\naverage. In the C team, they\nwere t run ced with only Mark' Wonder boy' Stanley bowling better than usual and Chris Wells (Club Captain, contact via\nChem Eng letter-racks!) putting\nin a reasonable score. As usual,\nwe couldn't raise a full ladies'\nteam so, if there are any ladies\nout there who have Wednesday\nafternoons free, come to a fun-packed bowling session, complete with novelty, prizes and\nthrills.\nJudo\nI CV BC Firsts. Add to this the\nfact that Wimbledon YMCA was mercilessly ground to dust\ntwo Saturdays ago, and there\nyou have the most improbable\nset of events since both Sylvana\nand I passed our finals last year.\n(When I were a lad...) Statistical\ntheory dictates that one of these\ndays we're going to get the great\ngrand addy of all thrashings, I suppose.\n^Badminton\nA very close knockout cup match was played on Saturday.\nIC only came out eventual winners due to their consuming\nmore Jaffa cakes per person and\nin addition \u2014 mini swiss roles!!\nAnyway, about the match.\nWe won, everyone played well, no-one played badly and\neveryone was very happy.\nSo the team marches towards\nimmortality, spurred on by\nthe thought of Jaffa cakes at\nthe end of the rainbow.\nACC Don't forget the Christmas ACC meeting. Father Christmas won't be present but Ian will be\ndoing his best Rudolph imp res sion. Venue is lower refectory\nand time is 1830h TONIGHT.' Why on earth are you running around when there's champagne here to drink?'\nTwas brill ig and the slit hy to ve did gy re and gym ble in the wa be... Which is as good a way to start\nas any. But to business: it was\nthe dark and stormy night of\nTuesday November 30, when\nabout ten members of LH MC Judo Club arrived at Imperial\nCollege to do battle for the shiny\ntrophy in the Union Office. Undaunted by the fearsome opposition, the IC team set upon\nthem and pasted them all over .\nthe mat, leaving a nice job for\nthe cleaning ladies in the\nmorning...To summarise IC won\n5-0.\nVolleyball\nFirst the good news: since I last\nset pen to paper in this, the\nintellectuals' 'Sporting Life', IC Volleyball Club has risen to\ndizzy heights, and we are all on\nthe brink of a communal vertigo\nepidemic (no, no herpes is an\nentirely different disease!). Over\nthe last few weeks Goldsmiths\nCollege, Central London Poly\nand Hatfield Poly have crumbled\nbefore the invincible stalwarts of\n\u2022 \u2022 H BH HH HH December\nFootball\nFELIX Score\nTwo\nThe FELIX staff showed what\nan adaptable lot they are on\nSunday in Hyde Park, taking to\nfootball like a duck to orange\nsauce.\nFrom the moment the first\nwhistle blew FELIX made an\nincisive break with a run down\nthe centre and a goal by Peter\nRodgers. So 1-0 up after thirty\nseconds. Ents were obviously\nbaffled by the form FELIX were\nproducing and they took time to\nsettle down.\nNot content on a10 advantage FELIX pushed forward relentlessly \u2014 at times leaving their defence exposed Steve\nGoulder proved what a good\ndiplomat he is by not committing\nhimself at all. However, even\nwith this defensive problem. FELIX went into half-time with\ntwo goals to their credit.\nRecharged by the half-time\nchampagne and team talk, FELIX took to the field with a new determination. Things didn't go quite as well in the\nsecond half when a game of\ncontainment was seen to be\nplayed. Ents played hard and\none of FELIX' s valuable defenders, Pallab, was 'no bb led' by\nthe Ents desperate attackers.\nFELIX, were obviously getting\ntired and in the last few minutes\nthey threw all they had into\ndefence and somehow survived\nrelatively unscathed to reflect on\nmissed opportunities and mistakes made.\nTo sum up then. A good,\nclosely fought game with perhaps\nEnts' being the better team, but\non the day it was FELIX' s two\ngoals that counted. Perhaps FELIX were just lacking the\nextra 'magic' that their absent\n'number one' could provide.\n14, 19821 IFELIX\n\n"

The long-awaited motions on the National\nUnion of Students and the consistency of toilet paper were not heard\nbefore quorum was called, and will probably be resubmitted next year.\nThe President's report was\naccepted after much discussion;\nit included a recommendation to\naccept proposals that the Bar\nSub-committee only should see\ndetailed bar accounts and a report on the Students Services'\ncontroversial 'Accommodation\nLadder' which introduces a rigid\npecking order for the allocation\nof postgraduate places in Hall \u2014\ncries of 'Sexist' from the back of\nthe Hall were not taken seriously.\nThe report on the Southside\nMove was accepted after College\nSecretary John Smith had\nanswered questions from the\nfloor (see page 3).\nSeveral procedural motions\nlater, standing orders (the rules\ngoverning the conduct of UGMs)\nwere suspended so that an\nemergency motion on Stephen\nGoulder could be heard without\nthe Chairman's permission.

The\nmotion was passed unopposed,\nand if it is passed at a second\nU GM it will be put before the\nGoverning Body.\nMr Pyne then proposed a byelaw change to remove departmental representatives from\nCouncil, as their poor attendance\nrecord had made several recent\nCouncil meetings in quo rate, and\ntheir job did not make it necessary for them to attend Council.\nPeter Burt, the Life Sciences'\nDep Rep, opposed the motion\non the grounds that Dep Reps\nare the only 'non-hacks' on\nCouncil, that their attendance\nrecord was little worse than that\nof other Council members and\nthat it would be easier to lower\nthe Council quorum than to\nremove the Dep Reps.

    "content": "REVIEWS Chaucer In\nMonochrome\nThe Canterbury Pilgrims by Dyson\nImperial College Choir\nThe concert was taken up by a single work,\nThe Canterbury Pilgrims by the English\ncomposer and teacher Dr Dyson. It is a setting\nfor chorus, three soloists and orchestra of a substantial part of the Prologue to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the text partially modernised from the fourteenth century original.\nThe Prologue, after some scene-setting,\nportrays a collection of pilgrims on their way to\nthe shrine of St Thomas a Becket at\nCanterbury. Chaucer is not over-kind to his\npilgrims, for instance the monk is an extravagant hedonist, the doctor avaricious\nand the prioress preoccupied with courtly\nniceties.\nThis side of Chaucer's poetry is largely lost\nin the setting, the portraits are in monochrome\u2014we simply have mysterious music for\nthe astro logi st doctor and the MGM angels\nchorus for the prioress who feeds her pets on\nchoicest fare.\nAnother problem with the setting is that\nthere is just too much text, the word-sheet\nalone was twelve pages long. The effect of this\nis that the audience has to spend the entire\n\u2022 concert staring at the words lest they lose their\nplace.\nThe musical idiom is very much that of\nearlier Vaughan Williams, several of the\npassages are very reminiscent of the Sea\nSymphony. However, Dyson lacks the\ncourage of his conviction and at the top of a crescendo, rather than opening out into the\nstrong broad melodies characteristic of that\nwork, he lets the opportunity slip b v. The\nsame applies to his attempts to build tension;\njust as the music begins to excite he\nintroduces some inconsequential figure and\neverything collapses. The piece would require\nconsiderably more than Eric Brown's slightly\nflaccid conducting even to begin to come to\nlife.\nIn spite of the drawbacks of the composition,\nthe members of the choir were evidently\nenjoying ti.\u00b0m selves. The solidity of their\nopening ph rises, after the un impressively chaotic orchestral introduction clearly established the choir as the better-disciplined\nbody. On the whole, intonation and diction\nwere good and they made the most of any\nopportunity for exuberant display. Apart from\na couple of weak entries, the only noticeable\nlack of confidence occurred during the fuga l start to the Clerke of Oxen ford, not by\ncoincidence the furthest that the vocal parts\nstrayed from conventional harmonic writing.\nIt was in the more contrapuntal sections that\nthe poor balance was particularly evident. This\nwas partly the fault of the conductor who\ncould have done much more to bring out the\ndifferent lines. The real problem, however, was\nin the stodgy and unimaginative orchestration.\nFine though the brass playing was (the\nwoodwind too) it was wearisome to listen to\nthe whole overpowering section at almost\nevery possible forte. The woodwind writing\nwas clich ed as well, with far too many pastoral\noboes and twittering flutes.\nThe use of quality soloists in a piece such as\nthis is, of course, mandatory, and in this case\ntheir contribution was suitably professional.\nHowever it did not seem that the work aroused their interest and it was .only the\nsoprano Elizabeth Ritchie, who, in the Wife of\nBath, showed any enthusiasm.\nThe choice of so pedestrian a work is a little\nsurprising. Many of the choir have at most\nthree years of membership. Surely, given the\nvast repertory of excellent choral music that\nexists to be explored, it is a shame to waste a whole term on, this piece. Experimentation is\nan excellent principle, but unless it be in small\ndoses, it does not always advance a composer's cause.\nTim Pigden\nFeast of Music\nOverture to the Magic Flute, Mozart\nClarinet Concerto No 1, Weber\nThe Planet Suite, Hoist\nImperial College Symphony Orchestra\nThe audience at the Imperial College Symphony Orchestra concert on Friday were\ntreated to a feast of music of a very high\nstandard. Under the direction of Richard Dickins, the orchestra has developed over the\npast few years from a group of individual\nmusicians to a team Emlyn Hughes would be\nproud of.\nMozart' s overture to the Magic Flute\nopened the concert which apart from the\noccasional scrappy string playing was full of\ndelightful contrasts. At times I felt the\norchestra were seated too far apart to be able\nto keep together, but overall the music was as\nlight and energetic as Mozart demands.\nThe clarinet is a very popular instrument\nwith beginners, few of whom can even hope to\nachieve the technical brilliance of David Fuest\nin Weber's Clarinet Concert No. 1. This very\ndemanding piece was effortlessly played with\nsome very moving passages in the slow\nmovement, and technical brilliance towards\nthe end. A small orchestra here accompanied\nvery sympathetically, particularly in the string\nsection, and achieved a very pleasing result.\nFor an amateur orchestra to attempt such a difficult work as the Planet Suite by Hoist, is\nalways a gamble, but in this case it certainly\npaid off. Mars, the Bringer of War was\npowerfully played, with some excellent fortissimo s and a strong rhythm throughout.\nThe orchestra now achieved good cohesion\nand balance, previously lacking, helped by a dynamic percussion section.\nVenus, the Bringer of Peace was a complete\ncontrast, but not, I think, as Hoist intended.\nThe intonation was rather poor in places, and\nthe players were again just not together.\nHowever the work improved from then on,\nwith Mercury being light and bright with some\nlovely oboe solos.\nIC SO obviously has no problems at all in\nplaying loud movements, and Jupiter was as\nexciting as I 've ever heard it. The central\ntheme was warmly played by the brass,\nwhereas the strings excelled with some\nbeautiful passages in the closing themes of\nSaturn. Uranus the magician was not really\nmagical enough, but the closing movement,\nNeptune, was excellent with a good performance from the choir; but is closing the door\nthe proper way to achieve a diminuendo?\nPenny Kinns\nSlick and Amazing\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern\nImperial College Dramatic Society\n\"What are you playing at?\"\n\"Words...words, they're all we have to go on.\"\nThus spoke Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\u2014\nor was it the other way round? Even the characters themselves suffer from perpetual confusion\nas to which is which. In any case, the lines sum up\nTom Stoppard's approach to writing plays. His\nplays are full of sharp wit, plays on words, and\ntwisted logic. He has a marvellous way of\nmaking the lines flow smoothly from character\nto character, at times so slickly that one loses\nthe sense in amazement at the fluidity of the\nlanguage.\nThe play concerns two minor characters\nfrom Hamlet, and is a somewhat bizarre and\nsurreal exploration of what they are doing when\nnot directly involved in the action of that play.\nTotally bewildered as to who they are, where\nthey come from, where they are going and why,\nthey drift along in perpetual confusion, their\nactions determined by events in that other play.\nThis probably sounds very arty and boring, but\nStoppard makes the (non-)action sparkle with\nhumour and wit. His avowed intention was to\nwrite a comedy, and he succeeded admirably.\nThe humour is very much clever humour, rather than sidesplitting slapstick.\nThe play rests very heavily on the performance of the two main characters. Fortunately, both Jon Gulliver and Dave Simmons rose admirably to the task, giving very\nconvincing and well thought out performances.\nThey were matched by David Roberts, who\nplayed the leader of the troupe of travelling\nplayers. Together, the three of them carried\nalmost the entire two hours\u2014not an easy task\nat all. They were helped by the players, who\ndelivered a brilliantly funny slapstick dress\nrehearsal of a play they were to perform for\nHamlet and the King, and who, although they\nhad little to say, consist ant ly provided convincing background action. There were also\noccasional contributions from members of the\ncourt; most of the scenes, unfortunately, came\nover as somewhat wooden.\nThe set design for the ship scene was simple\nand effective. However, this struck a distinctly\nodd note in comparison to the sets of Acts I and\nII, which used simply a bare stage to represent a clearing, a palace, and a harbour, with no props\nor back cloth for any of them.\nStill, all things considered, this was a well\nacted and well produced version of a difficult\nplay, and was a very enjoyable and thought\nprovoking evening.\nFinally, may I point out, in reply to Eric's letter\n(elsewhere in this issue) that the point of\nreviewing West End theatre is so that people\ncan make up their minds whether to go and see\nthe plays for themselves. By the time you read\nthis (and I am writing not half an hour after\nseeing the play) the run will have finished, and\nif you missed it you are too late. What I can\nsay, though, is that our home talent is worth\nconsidering; go and see the next production.\nDave Jago\nPage 20 December 14, 1982 FELIX\n\n"

Gastropod hasn't quite\ngot round to reviewing this pinnacle of culinary excellence\nyet, probably because so many\nIC students have been banned\non account of their in d ul gence with the relish tray. The last time ex-Editor Steve Marshall ate there he took great delight in\nsitting near the door so that on completion of his meal, before\nhe had received the bill, he and his friends could leap up from\ntheir table and be out of the door\nand halfway back to College\nbefore the waiters could realise\nthat Steve had left payment for\nthe meal lying on the table.\nBut it's the waiters themselves\nthat cause most amusement, and\nwho have led to the eating-house\nnicknamed 'Strokes' by more\nthan a few. I realise there are\ncertain men in this world who speak in an affected manner,\nwho embellish their speech with\ncamp gestures and who wear\nconstrictive ly tight trousers\u2014\nbut why do they all gather for\nemployment in South Ken sing ton in a restaurant which caters\nfor a more or less normal clientele? How much will the\npublic put up with before they\nstop eating there? Already one\n(heterosexual) friend is distinctly\nwary of the place since the time\nin the company of a male friend\nhe was great ed with' Good evening, I like the new boy-friend.'\nBut the most alarming incident\noccurred on an occasion when\nthe IC Orchestra committee were eating there just before a rehearsal. Tim Jones, the chairman, was passing round\nsome holiday photographs while\nthey were waiting for the meal,\nand as he did so, the company\nbecame aware that one of the\nwaiters was taking a more than\npassing interest in the proceedings, and was evidently studying the pictures quite carefully.\nEventually he seized a picture\nof Tim from somebody, and began to study it. Tim had recently grown a splendid beard\nvery quickly, and so the photo-graphic version was not a particularly good likeness of the\nhirsute young man before him, but eventually the waiter noticed\nthe resemblance and compared\nthe two critically while the rest\nof the committee waited in expectant silence. Finally he\naddressed Tim directly 'This is\nyou, isn't it?' Tim managed a nod.\n'Much more sexy without the\nbeard!' And he minced back to\nthe kitchen leaving Tim and friends with a mixture of amusement and speechless astonishment.\nSINCE GUILDS Gen Com have\nforced Frank Rowsell to stop\npillorying Nick Pyne in Guildsheet, I suppose it falls to me to\ntell of his return from a particularly extravagant party last\nweek. He was stopped by an\nofficer of the law as he cycled his\ninebriated way home and was\nasked if he realised how dangerous it is to cross a red traffic\nlight. Luckily for Nick he had the presence of mind not to let\non that in his condition he\nhadn't seen the light at all, and\nprobably wouldn't recognise one\nif he ran into it; he was let off\nwith a caution.\nTo some extent it was his own fault, for he was riding a tandem\non his own; anything so eccentric is bound to be queried by a bored police patrol in the early\nhours of the morning. A friend\nwho can ride a mono cycle has\ngiven up using it in the town\nwhere he lives because every\npoliceman he passes stops him and then tries to think of a law\nhe's breaking.\nBut to return to inebriated\ntandem is ts,I have often wondered what the law would do if it\ncaught up with two people on a tandem, the front one( the 'captain') stone cold sober, and the back one (the 'stoker', who has considerable influence on steering and balance) paralytic.\nIt's certainly dangerous, but what law could they prosecute\nunder?

Orders can be placed with\nthe Refectory Office, ground floor, Sherfield\nbut cash or cheque on collection, please.

The\ngreatest Hocks come from the Rheingau,\nmade exclusively from the Riesling grape. In\nthe Moselle, this aristocratic vine also yields\nexquisite though lighter wines. In the more\nsoutherly regions\u2014Rheinhessen and Rheinpfalz\u2014the Hocks are mellower and quicker to\nmature; the predominant grape there is\nSylvaner, together with a more recent cross,\ncalled the Scheurebe. Two reasonably priced\nHocks are the Rudesheimer Rosengarten 1979\n(\u00a32.80) and the Schloss bock e lheim er Felsenberg 1977 (\u00a33.75). The Hocks from\nthe 1976 vintage are: Gersenheimer Schlossgarten (\u00a33.75), Kreuznacher St Martin (\u00a35),\nWinkeler Hasenprung Auslese (\u00a36.75) and\nJohannisberger Holle Auslese (\u00a37).\nMany of the clarets on the list are rather\nyoung. All the major regions are represented.\nMost of the 1978 and 1979 wines should be\nkept for several more years, although the Ch\nLa Tour St. Bonnet 1979 (3.45) and the Ch. de\nPez 1979 (\u00a35.50) are quite superb already. Of\nthe somewhat older wines Ch. Medoce 1972\n(\u00a32.80) and Ch. Mortheil 1975 (\u00a32.85) are\npriced very modestly, One has to pay more for\nthe bigger wines of the 1973 vintage which\nstand at about \u00a37.00 a bottle on the list.\nShould none of these xl are ts be attractive then\nthere is a small selection from Burgundy, some\nexcellent Beaujolais and you could always\nexperiment with one of the full bodied, high\nalcohol wines from California\u2014we have it all!\nHave a happy Christmas.\nP Grootenhuis\nChairman, IC Wine Committee\nCordon Bleugh!\nAs a special Christmas treat for those of our readers who\nfancy themselves as aspiring chefs, FELIX asked that renowned master of the culinary arts Victor Mooney to submit a few of his favourite recipes\n8B86 QQ999 II\nShrimp and Raspberry Cocktail\nLine glasses with fresh young turnip-tops.

Most people release the\negg very close to the ground, but it's a remarkable\nfact that if it is dropped from a height of more than\nsix feet it will align itself so that its strong long axis\nis exactly vertical, which means that if it lands on a surface which is smooth but not too hard it won't even crack. Ideal surfaces are grass, smooth\ncarpets (such as the carpet tiles in most halls of\nresidence) and that loose-weave rush matting you\nsometimes see in trendy homes. Don't try it on\nlino, concrete, parquet\nAnother puzzle: this one is for contortionists and\nhas no easy solution. Place a matchbox on end on\nthe floor. Now, without using any walls or\nfurniture to steady yourself, and without letting\nany part of your body except your feet touch the\nfloor, pick up the matchbox in your teeth.\nAnother similar problem is to climb underneath a table without touching the floor.\n'Kneesy, Earsy, Nosey', a children's game which\nStan Laurel repeatedly confused Oliver Hardy\nwith in the film The Devil's Brother. Hold your\nnose with your right hand and your right ear with\nyour left hand.

Slap\nknees again, then back to the starting position.\nRepeat, over and over again, rhythmically and as\nquickly as possible.\nMake a tower with seven dominoes as shown,\nthen challenge someone to remove the lowest\nhorizontal domino without touching any of them\nand without letting the tower fall. It isn't easy, but\nwith practice you can flick an eighth domino\nupright and it will flick the required domino clear\nof the tower while inertia keeps the rest of them in\nposition.\n\u00a7\n3*\ni Next time you wear a suit or dinner jacket, put a reel of white thread in the inside pocket and, with\na needle, thread the end of it through the fabric of\nthe jacket leaving a few inches lying on one lapel.\nWhen a helpful friend tries to remove what looks\nlike a scrap of cotton from your clothing he'll be\nembarrassed to discover he's pulled out a length\nof thread several feet long.\nDrawings by Richard Archer\n\n"

    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nOpera Macabre\nLe Grand Macabre by Gyorgy Ligeti,\nEnglish National Opera at the London\nColiseum. British premiere.\nThe opera which 'shocked and scandal is ed Europe' when it was first performed in 1978 \u2014\nLe Grand Macabre - has finally hit London. Its\ncreator, the mischievous Mr Ligeti, has struck\nback.\nGyorgy Ligeti is best known for his\nAtmospheres, Requiem and Lux Aeterna,\nthose atmospheric pieces which were used to\nsuch superb effect in Stanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey, but he is also the originator\nof much more besides, music which, to say the\nleast, is bizarre. The performances of some of\nhis more eccentric pieces have entered the\nannals of history. There was that infamous\nconcert in a newly-opened hall where the\nplatform was filled with metronomes, and\nwhere musicians came on, wound them all up,\nand then left, leaving the audience to watch\ndozens of metronomes tick away until they\nstopped. That concert caused the architect of\nthe hall to feel insulted and nearly resulted in a writ. There was that choral piece devoid of\nlanguage which required the female singers to\nshriek at the top of their voices for prolonged\nperiods. (An interesting man is Mr Ligeti\u2014full\nof imagination). And there was that orchestral\npiece where a tray laid out for a high tea was\npompously crashed onto the floor at an\nappropriate point in the score, and which\nreduced the audience to hysterics. Yes, English National Opera has mounted one of\nhis works and Mr Ligeti is back in town (or he\nwas a week ago Thursday).\nProduced by Elijah Mosh in sky and conducted by Elgar Howarth, the ENO production is crazy, comic and bizarre. The\nstage is dominated by an enormous life-size\nsection of a piece of M4 slip way, with the top of\na double decker bus on the one side and a technologically tumble-down dwelling on the\nCaptain Lindley enjoying breakfast at the foot of the Queens Tower\n(Actually, a scene from Act 2 of Le Grand Macabre.)\nother. The plot is absurd. A drunk city gent,\nPiet the Pot (Roderic Keating) comes across a pair of lovers, Miranda (Penelope Mackay) and\nAmando (Jean Rigby), looking for a place\nwhere they can make love. Nek rot zar( Geoffrey Chard) enters as the driver of a hearse claiming to be the figure of Death and\ncharged with the task of putting an end to the\nworld. He forces Piet to help him in his\nmission. In scene two, Astradamors (Dennis\nWicks) is engaged in masochistic love play\nwith his big-bottomed wife Mescalina (Ann\nHoward). Mescalina implores Venus (Marilyn\nHill Smith) to give her a lover more potent than\nDennis Wicks as Astradamors and Ann Howard as Mescalina.\nher husband, and Nekrotzar, entering with\nPiet, responds to her appeal and kills her with\nhis violent lovemaking. The second act\nfeatures the palace of Prince GoGo, the end\nof the world and much else besides (which, for\nreasons of space, I am unable to describe).\nIf you think the plot is crazy, you ought to\nlisten to the music. To describe it is beyond my\npower but it is definitely the music which\nbreathes life to the characters and the plot. Le\nGrand Macabre is Ligeti' s eccentric trag i comical depiction of the last judgement\u2014\nthe end of time. It is freely adapted from Michel\nde Ghelderode's(18981962) La Balade due\nGrand Macabre, a Belgian dramatist. In\nLigeti's own words his work represents a 'very\ncolourful, comic strip like musical and dramatic action...the characters and situations\n(are) direct, terse, non psychological and startling \u2014 the very opposite of \" literary\" opera'. Le Grand Macabre is influenced by\nHieronymus Bosch and Lewis Carroll's Alice\nin Wonderland, and although it is almost\nsurrealist in its absurdity it is not surrealist as\nsuch because the action and thought behind\nthe opera is not divorced of reason or reality.\nAccording to Ligeti 'Le Grand Macabre is our\npresent-day world, depicted on another level\nof reality, on the level of absurd reality.' The\nabsurdity is death itself. In reality there is no\nexperience of death \u2014 nothing has been experienced but what has been lived. Death is\nan illusion that never quite convinces us, but\nfear is provided by the inexorable march of\ntime. 'Death and the whole dark future is of no\nsignificance to us, there is only a here and\nnow.'\nLigeti's opera is totally unique and cannot be\ncompared with anything else. The ENO production is one surprise from beginning to\nend, and it holds one's attention magnificently\nall the way through. The designs and accompanying action are extraordinary but\nwhat makes the opera really go is the music. It\nis difficult to criticise anything and trying to\ncriticise such a bizarre and unique work as this\nis rather silly!\nRecommended.\nNick Bedding\nFELIX II December 14, 19821 IPagel9\n\n"

But there\nwere quite a lot, I can tell you.\nThe other thing which may\nstrike you as a bit odd is the\nrather obvious space-filling\nadvertisements at the centre of\nthe newspaper, they are there\nbecause at the last minute we\ndecided it would be a pity to\nprint on the back of the Lindleydoll insert, since in places the\nprinting would show through,\nand also because we didn't want\nyou to have to spoil FELIX by\ncutting it up. Late on Sunday\nnight, then, I decided to include\nanother page in FELIX, and we\nthus needed two more pages of\ncopy\u2014quickly!\nOdds and Sods\nOne of the functions of the\nEditorial is that it's available as\na kind of dustbin for all the\nbe under twenty years of age.\nFuller details and entry forms\nare available from\nThe Engineering Council\nCanberra House\n10-16 Maltravers Street\nLondon WC2R 3ER In similar vein, Scholl are\norganising a competition to find\ntheir Student Athlete of the\nYear.

These are\navailable from the Guilds office.\nSerious Bits\nThere are lots of serious bits I was going to write, but on\nreflection it seems better just to\ngive a sentence or two outlining\nthe topics I feel strongly about,\nand then expand on them next\nterm when you're more likely to\ntake them to heart.\nSouthside security: It seems\nbonkers to me that the halls of\nresidence are locked at 1900h, yet open at 0500h; anyone who\nhas a mind to could, say, wander\nin and kidnap a vice president,\nor worse.\nThe new refectory: how\nthoughtful to provide unbreakable plastic plates for us clumsy\nstudents; but don't do what I did\nand bring the whole place into\nconfusion by asking for a drink\nof water with your meal.\nHarlington gravel: can it be\ntrue that College and the Union\nhave actually organised something to their mutual benefit\nwithout violent disagreement?\nAlso in next terms FELICE S we will be considering the post\nof Deputy President, and whether Christine Teller will run for\nit\nNext Term\n[Plans for next term's FELICE S' are well under way. One of the\nmain ideas I want to introduce is I an occasional feature article of\ngeneral interest\u2014not specifically\nrelated to any political or\nreligious viewpoint. I ment in ed this a few weeks back, and since\nthen we've been offered an\nouting with IC Balloon Club, a free parachute jump, and several\nother goodies. Special commendation for the two girls who\noffered to write a feature on a health and beauty parlour if we\ncould negotiate a free session for\nthem; it's looking hopeful for\nthat, too. We are also going to\nhave a FELIX investigation into\nboar pheromones, the only 'sex\naid' to be taken seriously in the\nlast twenty years.\nAnother idea I 've considered\nis to use FELIX to coordinate a campus-wide census with the\nhelp of, say, the Welfare depart-ment. Would you a) be interested and b) be prepared to cooperate with a serious, anonymous,\nproperly organised census into\nstudents' opinions and activities\nconcerning sex, sexism, drugs,\npolice harassment etc., and if so,\nwhat do you think should be\nincluded in the 'etc.'?\nAlso coming next term is a numerically sequential cartoon\nstrip entitled The Horns of\nUncertainty. The etymological\naspects of this will not become\nclear until the series begins to\nunfold, but as a foretaste, the\nzeroth installment is printed on\nthis page.\nImpossible Without\nleaving someone out of the\ncredits, but thanks are due to\nHugh Southey, Mark Smith,\nWalkabout-Cooksee, Gastropod, Adrian James, Andy Wood\n(for jeo pardi singa promising\ncareer with British Rail by\nsharing a railway compartment\nwith twenty six pounds of\nbladder wrack) David Britton,\nJon Barnett (or was it John\nBarnet?)

    "content": "THE FELIX FESTIVE FOOD GUIDE\nWalkabout Cooksee\nturns her attention from visual to culinary arts with\nthe emphasis on participation\nWalkabout-Looksee for this Christmas issue\nof FELIX will take you as far as a well stocked\nkitchen and drinks cabinet. As well as being\nhooked on my regular dose of visual art I am\nvery greedy (!) and revel in all the traditional\nChristmas fuss that surrounds holiday feasting\nand boozing. For any despairing culture\nvultures \u2014 take heart \u2014 I shall review the\nTreasures of Ancient Nigeria at the Royal\nAcademy in the first FELIX of next term: it's on until January 23, and highly recommended.\nTrie-APT \u00ab Ft A VL UNc) Mulled Wine\nPunches, pos sets, mulls, toddies and grog s \u2014all are good winter warmers on dark,\ncold days, just the thing after a long, numbing\nmotorbike journey, a morning tobogganing or\nas a morale booster on a gloomy, overcast\nday. They' re also ideal for Christmas parties\u2014they're great fun to make and give all\nyour guests at least one shared experience (!)\nto help break the social ice.\nIn Anglo-Saxon and early English times a 'wassail' was a mulled, spiced drink made with\nold ale and served at feasts. The word comes\nfrom the Norse 'ves he ill * meaning 'good\nhealth'. Punch, made with spirits, was introduced from India in the 17th Century.\nMaking punch was a high-society ritual,\ncarried out with much pomp and c irc um stance, and by Victorian times had become\nstrongly associated with Christmas.\nMulls are basically sugared and spiced\nwines, ales or ciders, usually diluted with water\nand then laced with fortified wine, spirit or\nliqueur. Here' s my recipe for the FELIX Glugg': it's a red wine mull, spiced and sugared\nto taste...my taste\u2014so try it and then adapt it\nas you will. FELIX Glugg will fill about a dozen\n1\n/t pint goblets.\nStud an orange with six cloves and bake it in\na moderate oven for half an hour. Boil a pint of\nwater with two tablespoonsful of castor sugar,\na small stick of cinnamon and a little grated\nnutmeg. Bubble this gently for about fifteen\nminutes, till all the sugar has dissolved. In\nanother pan gently heat one bottle of any fairly\nrobust, inexpensive red wine; supermarket\nfull-bodied Spanish will do very nicely. After all,\nthe mull derives its character from the spices\netc, so it seems a pity to 'waste' a fine wine on\nit. Get the wine to not-quite-simmering point,\nbut don't let it boil or you'll evaporate all the\nalcohol! Remove it from the heat and add the\nspiced boiling water and the baked orange. Stir\nin a wineglass of an orange liqueur (Cointreau,\nGrand Marnier or Curacao) and the same\nquantity of brandy (again, supermarket home-brand is fine). Ladle it into punch cups (small\nchina or glass mugs) and serve at once.\nMince Pies\nThere are several rather nice things about\nmulled wine, not least of which is that it's a perfect accompaniment to mince pies\u2014which\nis a very good excuse for making, and then\nconsuming, lots of mince pies! Most families\nhave a cherished recipe for mincemeat, a well\nguarded secret handed from grandmother to\ngranddaughter...which is sexist, and grossly\nunfair to each new generation of Christmaschefs! I therefore submit my own recipe for\nmincemeat. It will fill up to three dozen mince\npies depending, obviously, on how big the\ndepressions in your baking tray are and how\nfull you like your pies.\nStart with\n4oz seeded raisins\n4oz currants\n2oz sultanas\n2oz candied peel\nand 1 large, peeled and cored apple.\nChop or mince these to produce a rough- or\nsmooth-textured mixture, as you prefer. In a bowl, mix the fruit with\n4oz shredded suet\n4oz soft, brown sugar\n2oz ground almonds\nand 2 tablespoon sul of marmalade.\nGrate the rind off a lemon and squeeze the\njuice from it. Add these to the mixture, and\nalso 1 teaspoon of mixed spice, a pinch of\nnutmeg and two tablespoonsful of brandy. Mix\nwell till all is evenly amalgamated. Then cover\nthe bowl, or put the mincemeat in sealed jars,\ntill you want to use it. It keeps well for several\nweeks in a cool place, and because of the\nalcohol matures and improves!\nOhib OF Trie hl lte ST\nTHHCjS /r So i rr Xnfc\nWalkabout-Pastrycook\nNo one else's pastry is ever as good: 'pastry\nlike Mum makes it' reigns supreme. But it's difficult to reproduce if you can't remember\nexactly how Mum does make it. I like pastry\nvery light and very short\u2014which means that it\nmelts in the mouth, but crumbles in the hand.\nIt needs to be made in a relaxed frame of mind\nwith a light hand...both of which can be\nachieved with practice. If you're in a desperate\nhurry, or desperate for Mum's pastry, Waitrose sells frozen shortcrust pastry (which\nI have not tried, so cannot vouch for) or, if you\nask her nicely and don't reverse the charges,\nMum might explain how she does it. However,\n\\NCim>it Nr s for fellow-enthusiasts, here's a WalkaboutPastrycook's version, which will make up to\ntwo dozen mince pies, depending again on the\nsize of the pies.\n8oz fine, plain flour\n4oz soft butter\n2 teaspoonfuls of icing sugar\n1 large egg yolk or 1 very small egg\nMix the flour and sugar in a bowl. Add the\nsoft butter and rub it into the flour lightly with\nyour fingertips. When the mixture is like soft\nbread crumbs add the egg and use the blade of\na knife to mix till it begins to cling together.\nThen press it into a ball and knead it just\nenough to free the pasty from cracks. The less\nthe pastry is handled the lighter it will be, and\nthis also applies to rolling it out. Use the rolling\npin gently: roll the pastry out thinly (3-4mm) on\na lightly floured board and cut it into rounds\nusing different sized cutters (the lid should be\nsmaller than the base!). Put the bases in a well\nbuttered pie tray and spoon mincemeat into\nthem. Depending on how generous you are\nthere will be more or less left over for the next\nbatch...or for nibbling as you cook! Place the\nlids on' the filled bases and brush the top of\neach pie with a little milk if you like your pastry\nshiny. Bake near the top of a hot oven (Gas 7,\n425F) for about fifteen minutes, until golden\nbrown. Let them cool in the baking tray for a few minutes and then transfer to a cooling\nrack. Eat them hot or cold, but dust them with\nicing sugar first.\nHappy drinking, 'bon ap petit', and Merry\nChristmas.\nPagel4l December 14, 1982Ei FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Gandhi\nGandhi (A) produced and directed by\nRichard Attenborough is now showing\nonly at the Odeon, Leicester Square.\nFighting for notice in among the ET hype,\nthis film may have escaped your notice.\nTwenty years from conception to completion,\nthis is an epic in the grand tradition, except in\none major respect: the great man himself is\nportrayed by a complete unknown; beset by\nColumbia on one side, who wanted a star, and\nthe Indian government who wanted an Indian\nto play the central role, Richard Attenborough\ntrusted his own judgement and gave Ben\nKingsley the role. The choice proved inspired;\nMr Kingsley is half Indian and bears a striking\nlikeness, due in part to the strenuous efforts of\nthe make-up department, to Gandhi. This was\na difficult role to be handed as your first major\nacting role; no praise is high enough for his\nperformance, he comes through with flying\ncolours and is utterly convincing.\nIn making this film, casting has not been the\nonly tightrope Attenborough has had to walk.\nHow do you make a film such as this entertaining, and a commercial success for\nColumbia, and yet avoid offending the Indians\nby portraying a man, virtually deified by the\nIndians themselves, as anything less than\nsuperhuman?\nThe political problems involved with making\na film of this size and scope, filmed on location,\nwith apparently no tricks in the crowd scenes\n(they really had a million extras at the filming of\nthe funeral), means that the film tends to be\n'safe'; neither Hindu nor Muslim is blamed for\nthe schisms of the independence years. Even\nNehru emerges with a pristine image, a man\napparently much admired by Attenborough,\nwho constantly encouraged him during production difficulties, perhaps to try to\nsalvage a rather tarnished image?\nThere are also some interesting history\nlessons to be learnt, some of questionable\naccuracy. I'm afraid the old Raj doesn't come\noff very well either, seeming to consist of either\nsadistic, callous butchers, or inept corrupt\npoliticians. The rosy picture created by our\nhistory books of a few isolated revolts followed\nby a skilful agreement between Mountbatten\nand the Indians leading to swift and secure\nindependence, is rather swept aside. Instead,\nGandhi is brought centre stage, the other\ncharacters reduced to mere puppets responding to his guidance.\nThis film seeks to portray Gandhi as by far\nthe most important figure in Indian politics of\nthe time; my knowledge of Indian history is not\nprofound enough to be able to judge. All that\napart, it is still a sumptuous ly splendid film, and\ngets us near as any film can to the man. Since,\nprobably it is his personal example and his\nwriting rather than what he did in the life of his\nnation that gave him his influence, it works\nwell. He was in many ways the conscience of\nthe Indian people.\nThe film is without doubt, an uplifting\nexperience. This man's belief was unshakable,\nhis energy endless and he pursued truth in his\npublic and private life with utmost tenacity. It is\nthe story of the small man, the humble man;\narmed only with tolerance and kindness he\ntook on the power of the empire. It makes you\nbelieve in the power of the individual. He is\nportrayed as a good man, not a divine being.\nHe pioneered the technique of passive\nresistance and probably used it more effectively than any man since, due to his\nunreserved condemnation of violent acts on\nhis behalf. He proved that all Christian tyrants\nhave a weak spot. They must prove they have\nmoral ascendancy over the 'pack of savages'\nIREVIEWSI\nthey rule. Disprove that, and you have robbed\nthem of their right to rule. Prove you are their\nmoral superior and they will walk out of your\ncountry with their head hung low.\nIf the choice of the central role was curious\nthe choice of supporting cast shows an eye for\nthe box office. The Raj is represented by those\nmost British of actors Edward Fox and John\nGielgud, both doing their best to look confused\nand angry as the little man runs rings round\nthem, while Candice Bergen and Ian\nCharleson (of Chariots of Fire fame) play his\n'disciples'.\nCuriously, Gandhi's death to a fanatic's bullet is repeated; shown once at the beginning\nET. ET, The Extra-Terrestrial. Produced and\ndirected by Steven Spielberg, showing\njust about bloody everywhere.\nAs I stare at this blank piece of paper, I try to\nthink of something original, witty and incisive\nto say of a film about which more verb age has\nbeen expanded than on probably any other\nfilm in history. So what is so special about two\nthousand meters or so of celluloid that appear\nto have had an impact as profound as\nWatergate or Vietnam on American society,\nand as much media coverage? Why, before\nthe film left the States had it become the box\noffice number one of all time? Why, despite\npirate videos and marketing cock-ups of awe-inspiring quality, do UIP executives look to this\nfilm to set their whole operation in this country\nback on its feet and keep them in gin and tonic\nfor the next decade? Perhaps the answer was\nin the faces I saw leaving the cinema through\nmy own somewhat glazed eyes, of press-hacks\nsmiling sheepish grins on tear-stained faces,\npeople who hadn't shed tears at a film since\nthey wept in Bambi when they were ten years\nold.\nWithout doubt, Spielberg has made the\nultimate tear jerk er. It is a story of love. Unlike\nGone With The Wind, it is pure love, untainted\nby lust and jealousy, as only a kids film can be.\nIt is, after all, a kids' film, a point emphasised\nby the kids-eye-view filming angle employed\nthroughout.\nThe morals are simple: all children are good\nor at worst misguided, grown-ups either don't understand or are plain evil. But good, in the\nend, will always triumph over evil.\nThe extra-terrestrial is abandoned when his\nfellow travellers to earth beat a hasty retreat,\nwhere they receive a distinctly unfavourable\nreception from the powers that be; perhaps\nthey couldn't play the trombone very well or\njust couldn't be bothered with all the red tape.\nHe takes refuge in a back yard in that familiar\nSpielberg stamping ground of middle class\nand once at the end, although from different\nviewpoints, just in case after three hours of fast\nand furious action you had forgotten. This\nfeels strange; you feel as if you've been in one\nof those notorious Hollywood flashbacks, and\nthe star is just about to say \"so you see, doc,\nthat's how I ended up with all these bullet\nholes\". But this is a small point in this work\nwhich does justice to a man without office or\ntitle, wealth or greed, without whom the\nhistory troubled subcontinent might have been\nvery different; where even today a certain\nrather ruthless politician (although she is no\nrelation) can use his name to justify acts the\nMahatma would have condemned.\nsurburb i a. Elliott, a kid hung up about his\nparents' marital problems and life in general,\nfinds and befriends ET, and that's all you get\nfrom me.\nThere is no pretence at 'serious' science\nfiction as in Close Encounters; indeed there\nare a few pot shots taken at the sacred cow of\n'scientific' science fiction in this film; this is\nsimply a film about the emotions of a small\nrather mixed up kid, and a 'thing'. Walt Disney\nwould have used a dog or a fluffy white rabbit,\nbut we've moved on; the eighties want aliens.\nWith this film, the state of the art in models\nhas taken a further quantum leap. From now\non, models will have to be criticised for acting\nability and chara teri station and it is hard to\nbelieve that ET isn't some midget in a wrinkly\ncostume. As for the human cast, there is little\nto fault; they are somewhat swamped by the\nmodels and the special effects, but they all\nmanage to come over well, especially Henry\nThomas as Elliott; in one scene he has to be\ngrief stricken and seconds later 'act' grief\nstricken, not an easy trick to do convincingly.\nDespite the fact that criticising the holy\nSpielberg is the sort of thing they would probably, in less enlightened times, hack off\nvarious limbs for, may I make ali tte point\n(please) ? In this and the last film he was\ninvolved in, Poltergeist, Spielberg has made a double ending. You almost feel he has gone\naway to the cutting room, happy that the film is\n\"in the can\", and then panics when he has\nedited it down to an hour and decides he'd better go out and shoot some more.\nYou are left there, hanging, after the first\nclimax waiting for the credits to roll and the\ntheme music to swell as gradually it dawns on\nyou that there is more to come. Still, the extra\nbit is worth the readjustment as Spielberg\ntightens the screw another turn, and drains\nyou of your last drop of emotion. By no means\na great film, but a piece of pure entertainment\nwhich I'm sure will drag even the diehards\nkicking and screaming from their TV and easy\nchair into the cold winter evenings.\nLee Paddon\nFELIXI IDecember 14, 1982 Page\n\n"

Bye y 'all.\nVcg Soc\nFor those of you who don't want to reform\nChristmas, lettuce reassure you that this is no\nmore our intention than to take a bag full of\nraisins and turn her into a Sultana...But talking\nabout our fourth coming party (Easter was the.\nsecond coming), we are thinking of changing\nsome names and phrases: Our pantomime\n'Aladdin and the 40 Thieves' will be replaced\nwith 'Alfalfa and the faulty chefs'; a 'cold meat\nsalad' shall be called 'chilly con carne'; mousetraps shall be known as 'Rats-atu er', and both 'fast food' and prunes shall be\nreferred to as 'cel eri'. So come to our party,\nwhere you can look forward to a splendid meal\nwith relish (or tomato sauce if the relish isn'tOK). If you want a whole meal, you'd better\nturn up early in case there isn't mushroom.\nYou can come perhaps to pass an evening\npleasantly chatting (...do I detect a split P there\nor was it perhaps a split infinitive?...).\n\"Hey, Paddy, will ya pasta food across?\"\n\" Eh, Pierre, parsley vegetables/\n\" OK, here's a pizza something or other...\" Renew old friendships\n\"I'm sure I soya at the Freshers' Fair \"\n\"Yes, it's bean along time \"\nGregariously engage (ie green gage) in\nintelligent conversation....\n\"That swede thinks Coleslow is the capital\nof Cnorway \"\nof...\".... isn't Bugs Bunny an interesting car roter.\"... or even gossip.\n\"Hey, Shaemus, can you see, is that Annie\nand Pieter?\"\n\" No,I don't tink it's Onion Pie tere at all, at\nall.\" And extend invitations...you'll have to\ncome auber, Jean.\"\nSo make a date (or fig or plum) for the\nrenaming party. Even Avocado. For the\ncarnivorous, come and meat people. For the\nrest, turn green (vegetarian) at the sight of\nthem, and rabbit or shout it for days. I bet you\ncan hardly wheat! (Cor, that one was corny!).\nWell, there's food for thought, even if\nwritten in apple-ingly bad taste. But I'm sure\nyou g hurt the gist of it. So donut forget...rice to\nthe occasion...no? oh all right then, peas\nyourself.

Soc Soc\nThanks to everyone who helped to make\nhuman rights week a success. It's hard to\nmake much impact at a place like IC, but every\nlittle helps.\nNext week we're having our Christmas\nParty on Tuesday December 14 at 8:00pm in\nthe Bot/Zoo Common Room (25p to get in).\nEveryone's welcome to come along, whether\nit's to discuss Trotsky' s part in the St\nPetersburg Soviet or just for the booze.

    "content": "College Slams\nStudent Suspicion\non Southside Move\nImperial College will not survive\nafter the recession unless sports\nfacilities and student accommodation are dramatically extended,\naccording to College Secretary\nJohn Smith. Mr Smith, the most\nsenior administrator at IC, was\naddressing last Tuesday's Union\nGeneral Meeting on the subject of\nthe projected Southside move.\nNow that plans to build a post-experience centre have been\nshelved, he said, the only pressure on space in the Beit\nbuilding (where the Union is at\npresent) comes from the Life\nScience departments, which are\nthe least well-housed in College.\nHowever, there are no immediate\nplans to move existing Union facilities from Beit, but only to\nextend them by using the vast\nemp y area under the Southside\nHalls of Residence. In return,\nCollege might ask for some of\nthe rooms in Beit for the Biology\ndepartment in a few years' time.\nMr Smith hopes that in the\nlong term Life Sciences will have\na new building on the site of the\nold RCS block, which will be\ndemolished once the new chemistry department is finished\u2014this\nis unlikely to happen before\n1988. He then sees all of the Beit\nbuilding and Princes Gardens as\nbeing given over entirely to\nstudent accommodation, Union and recreation. The best stud ents, he claimed, are discouraged from coming to London by problems of accommodation\nand poor sports facilities.\nMr Smith expressed his disappointment at the Union's initial suspicion \u2014 he has, he\nsaid, no motives other than to\nfill the expensive, heated spaces\non the lower levels of Southside.\nHe told the U GM that no action\nwill be taken without fair negotiation, but that neither he\nnor the students could commit\ntheir successors to a particular\ncourse of action.\nCollege Secretary John Smith\naddressing students about the\nSouthside move at last Tuesday's UGM.\nWhen Mr Smith had finished\nanswering questions from the\nfloor, a resolution to delegate\nnegotiations for 'the installation\nof increased sports and recreational facilities and shop space in\nSouthside in consultation with\nthe major sub-committee chair-men,' was passed unopposed.\nChelsea\nSit-in\nStudents at Chelsea College are\nstaging a sit-in this week as a protest against the proposed\nmerger of their college with Kings\nand QEC. At a Union General\nMeeting on Thursday, a motion\nwas unanimously passed that the\nregistry, the Principal's office ami\nthe Administration Block should\nbe occupied from Monday until\nWednesday afternoon. The\nprotesters will then move to the\nSenate House in Malet Street,\nwhere the Senate of the University\nof London will be meeting to\ndiscuss the merger.\nThe Chelsea students are\nconcerned that both their own\ncollege council and the Senate\nwill approve the merger in\nprinciple while draft proposals\nare still vague. If this happens, it\nis almost inevitable that the\nmerger will go ahead, with the\nstudent body having virtually no\nsay in the arran gm ents. Student representation on\nboth the Senate and Chelsea\nCollege Council is minimal, and\noccupation is seen as the only\nway of attracting the publicity\nand support of the larger colleges.\nFREE!! YOUR VERY OWN CAPTAIN LINDLEY\nSEAFARERS' BAROMETER\nInstructions\nHang your barometer on the mast,\nthe outside wall of your cabin, or\nanywhere it is exposed to the\nelements. Inspect it every morning,\nand determine the weather using the\nfollowing table:\nBarometer Dry - Fine Weather\nBarometer Wet - Rain\nBarometer Stiff - Frost\nBarometer Waving About - Wind\nCannot See Barometer - Fog\nWith care and proper treatment there\nis no reason why your Captain Lindley\nSeafarer's Barometer should not last\nyou a lifetime!\nFELIX December14,1982 "

    "content": "ASTOUND VOIJft\nwith this selection of tricks,\ngames and\njokes by\nAn ideal puzzle to try on your pals at the building\nsite, on a demolition ground, or anywhere there\nare five bricks you can use. The puzzle is simply to\npick up five bricks using one hand. The diagram\nshows how to do it.\nThe next time someone asks vo u to share an\napple with them, here's an amusing way of cutting\nit in half. The first cut is made vertically half way\ninto the top of the apple; the second cut is made\nsimilarly upward from the bottom but perpendicular to the first. Finally, the two cuts are joined\nby cuts made into the side of the apple from\ndiametrically opposite points on its 'equator'. It's impossible to describe, so see the diagram for\nwhat each half looks like.\nIn the bar, take an ordinary baby's rubber teat and\nbefore anyone can ask why you have such a thing\nwith you, bet someone they can't pour the entire\ncontents of a bottle of tonic water into the teat.\nWhen they give up, tie the teat to the neck of the\nbottle with a bit of string, block the hole with a matchstick, turn the whole lot upside down and\nshake it. The fizz from the tonic water will inflate\nthe teat to such a size as will comfortably\naccommodate all the liquid. Now ask yourself if it\nwas worth it\nOutdoors? Try locking your friend to a lamp post\nor a tree (parking meters are too thin). If you wrap\nyour legs round a tree as shown in the picture and\nthen sit down, your.own body weight makes it\nvery difficult (and if you're unfit, impossible) to\nstand up without being helped. Other entertaining\nacrobatics include climbing to a standing position\non top of a parking meter. Or you could try\nwalking along the narrow sloping ledge two feet\nfrom the ground on the Prince Consort Road side\nof the Union Building.\n\n"
