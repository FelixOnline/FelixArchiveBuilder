    "content": "2\nFELIX HEBRIDEAN EXPEDITION\nBOTANISTS, VISIT ORANSAY\nDaring August this year, a party of\nseven members of the Zoology Department\ntook part in an expedition to the Isle of\nOransay, one of the most westerly islands\nof the Inner Hebrides. It was led by\nBob Sturrook who, with the rest, had just\ncompleted his second year in the Zoology\nDept., and included two girls. The trip was run to gain experience\nin planning, camping and working under\nexpedition conditions and to see how the\nthe members survived each other's company\nover a reasonable period of time. Armed\nwith this knowledge, the planning of an\nexpedition to Ghana in1958, to follow\nthe one this year, should be greatly\nfacilitated.\nOn August 1st. six Members joined the\nseventh on the island to start the camp.\nThey had failed to meet three days earlier because of a failure on British Railways\nwhich resulted in the main party being\nunable to catch their boat. Yfliilst\nrefusing to accept responsibility,\nBritish Railways generously footed the\nbill for extra expenses incurred during a three day \"Tour of the Scottish Islands\"\nas the party made its way by an alter nat ve route to its destination.\nFor the next three weeks no major setbacks interfered with the camp and life progressed smoothly. Problems, including\nan investigation of littoral insects, a survey of the distribution of crane flies, an examination of the liver fluke*) f the\nisland and general biological collecting,\nwere carried out with reasonable success.\nA revealing insight into island life was\nobtained one night during a \"Ceilidh1\n'\n(pronounced cale y as in tray) on a neighbouring island - the effects of\nwhich were visible for several days j After this, gales from various directions combined with heavy rain showers\nbegan to play havoc with the camp. All the tents were damaged and running repairs\nhad to be made continuously under all conditions of gale, visibility and rain.\nEventually four of the a even tents\ncollapsed under the strain. Two of these\nwere of a design reputed by the makers to\nhave been tested in a South Georgia\nwinter - some comment on our English\nsummer! Throughout this period the\nmorale of the camp remained high,\nalthough we lost one member for external\nuncontrollable personal reasons (female).\nWith the subsidence of the gales the\nexpedition ran quietly to an end. On\nAugust 30th. camp was struck and members\nregretfully left the islands for their\nhomes. The kindness of the islanders\nimpressed itself an everyone and their\nhospitality will be long remembered.\nThe whole venture was undoubtedly\nsuccessful and provided all the\nexperience hoped far. A detailed report\nwill be given to the R.C.S. Natural\nHistory Society sometime in November,\ntogether with a film made during the\ntrip. R.F. S. COMMEMORATION DAY THURSDAY OCT.24 TH. ROYAL ALBERT HALL3 rm. SPECIAL VISITOR SIR ALEXANDER FLECK K.B.E., F.RS.. STUDENTS AND THEIR FRIENDS ADMITTED WITHOUT TICKET AT THE MAIN DOOR R.C.A. WASHED\nAttempts have recently been made to\nimprove the facilities of the Huxley\nBuilding. They necessitated the draining\nof the central heating system. The heating\nengineers eventually did arrive to refill the system, all going well until lunchtime\nwhen the job was only half-fin i a he d. True\nto the tradition of British Workmen, everything stopped for tea; that is, except the\nwater supply to the radiators which was\nleft running. The Inevitable happened.\nSlowly but unceasingly the water crept\nhigher and higher; one by one the radiators\nstarted to leak. It was found later that\nall the air. release vents had been left open, and several laboratories were flooded as a result.\nThe 'piece de resistance', however, was\nthe culmination of the whole episode. The\ncold water (hot never goes th rotu di these\nradiators) at last reached the top of the\nheating system and issued forth from an\nupper-o to rey window aa a long, penetrating\njet; so penetrating, in fact, that a row\nof motor- bicycles parked outside the\nneighbouring Royal College of Art reo eiv ed an unasked for, but nevertheless 'al gh ly effective, shower bath.\nTO WORK IN THE\nANTARCTIC\nEvery year a large number of those\nleaving I.C. go abroad in search of a change of scenery, or money, usually\nboth. But very few have travelled aa\nfar away as C.M. Smith (ex-Cham. Dept.)\nintends to go. He will spend the next\ntwo and a half years at a F.I.D.S. base\nin the Argentine Islands, Graham Land,\nAntarctica. As a change from organic\nchemistry he will be doing meteorological work, some of it in connection\nwith the International Geophysical Year.\nMartin, who is well known in the\nCollege for his mountaineering and\nphotographic activities, sails sc on on\nthe \"John Biscoe\", and after a short\nstay in Port Stanley he will be landed\nat the base, which he will share with\neleven other scientists, the penguins\nand'the seals. His 3p are time is to be\nspent doing photography and. bird-ringing.\nWe rather think that he will find\nlife a little bit quieter down there\nthan it is in I.C. NOT FOR ENGINEERS They've thrown us together, those Chemists up there\nAnd I hope you will see that it's really unfair \u2014\nYou're merely a number, whilst I have a name;\nOur status in life is hardly the same.\nAll thermodynamics can't make us combine\nFor I'm Kangarooin and you are 1-9.\nPEANUTS.\n\n"

Their latest embarrassment\nis the\"pirated\" article that appeared in the MANCHESTER GUARDIAN recently, describing the plans for the new Prince's Gardens\nHostel,\nThe College, it transpires, has suggested that the hostel be designed in such\na way that during the long vac. it con be\nconverted into hotel ac como dati on of a standard that would be attractive to American tourists. This is an excellent idea.\nAlthough new to this country, it is very\ncommon in Scandinavia, where such hotels\nare exceedingly popular.\nThe advantages of the scheme are ob-vio us. We congratulate the Planning Office\nand trust that they will carry it out without skimping on materials and workmanship.\nWe have too many examples of false economy\naround us already. Only the best will stand\nup to student wear and tear, and only the\nbest will appeal to our visitors from abroad.\nooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo Commemoration Day i a shortly upon us\nagain. To all those who have never attend-ed, especially fresher s, we say see for\nyourself what goes on. It is a side of\nCollege life that is all too rarely g limps ed.

Let us hope that we are\nto be spared this fate, if last\nSaturday's hop was an example of the\nbest the E.C. can do.\nWhat is this ridiculous nonsense of\nhaving Ladies' Invitation and Ladies'\nExouse-me dances? These appeared to be\nequally unpopular both with the men and\nthe ladies present. May we express cur\nsurprise and disgust at having a 'change\npartners' dance at 10.45 pm. This sort\nof thing will totally change the\ntraditional character of I.C. hops.\nWe cannot have band leaders taking\ncharge of our dances and running them as\nthough this were an East End Working\nMen's Club! The M.C. should definitely\nbe a responsible member of this College,\nand not a band leader.\nLastly, we must protest about the\nextreme difficulty of obtaining drinks.\nThe organisers of the dance should have\nbeen prepared f or the large number of\npeople requiring drinks.\nThe E.C. should set a better example\non how to run a hop, especially after\ntheir criticism of several Clubs last\nyear over the organisation of their\ndances.\nYours, in disgust,\nP.S.

GYMNASIUM FOR NEXT YEAR SHODDY WORKMANSHIP, BAD PLANNING INCONVENIENCE ATHLETIC CLUBS Why isn't the gymnasium finished yet?\nOnce again we, the members of the Union,\nare suffering from the incompetence of the\npowers that he to plan anything in such a way that i* is completed on time, or even\nwithin months of ths specified date.\nA week before the beginning of this\nterm, workmen moved in to carryout work\nthat was ordered to be done last WAT.\nIfore time seems to be spent drinking tea\nthan doing the work that the tax-payer is paying for. The whole business of the gymnasium\nIs one of blunders: this may sound a strong word to use, but its suitability is demonstrated by the following facts:\n1, The gym was designed in sue ha way\nthat it is two feet too short for Badminton. Consequently the Badminton Club\nwill suffer for a good many years by baring to play on outside courts.\n2. The radiators sera fitted into recesses in the walls so that they would\nbe out of the way, leaving the w jk ll s flat so that ball games could be played in safety.

    "content": "FELIX3 GHANA' S ECOLOGY STUDIED The following is an a e oo unt of\ntha I.C. Xoologloal Expedition to Ghana\nwhich took place this ram mer, sponsored\nby the Exploration BoardiGhana is a young o on n try and is almost- Impatient in its desire to\nsolve Its many problems, especially\nthe agricultural ones. The object of\nour expedition was ecologies! exploration with an economic inclination\nand touched on the most fundamental\ntropical problem, which is soil con-serva tion. The usual method of farming,\naway from the coastal plain, is by\nclearing the mature forest and planting\ncrops in the forest soil. The sun immediately begins to dry the humus and\nthe soli nutrients, now no longer held\nby an extensive root system, are etched\naway by the rain, and the area Is al lowed to degenerate to a secondary bush\nvegetation.\nThe focal point of the investigations of the three entomologists, two\nbotanists and the soil scientists was\nthe factors affecting the formation\nand destruction of humus, although each\nmember also studied isolated subjects.\nTwo main areas were studied. One was a strip trans ect in the Bobiri forest\nReserve extending from a stream through\na swamp, into thick forest on a slight\nhill; the other was once a swamp by a river but has been drained and deforested and now supports an ann uel crop of\nr loe. Rice has only reo ent ly been introduced there and the area can probably\nbe compared dire otl y with the other swamp\nwhich is still forested.\nDuring the eight weeks several\ntripe were made by one or all of the\nmembers, and Wiawso, Cape Coast, Achimota university in Ghana, Kano in Nigeria, and Agades on the fringe of the\nSahara were all visited. A truck and\ndriver were supplied by the department\nof Agriculture in Komasi (the capital\nof Ashanti) to make the trips in Ghana\npossible. Kumasi is only 20 miles from\nthe Bobiri Reserve, and as it is the\nheadquarters of the Opposition Party,\nwe got a good idea of the background to\nthe deportations, riots and court oases\nwhich have occurred recently.\nThe expedition we ur led by Hick\nJago who, together with Janet Petersen\nand Joyce Farmer organised the cook\nand two steward boys who performed our\nchores, We lived in two mosquito-proof\nbungalows, fortunately equipped with a refrigerator which was constantly maintained by Chris Green. This machine is of vital importance when the temperature is constantly around 80 degrees\nFahreneit and the relative humidity\nis100*. On October 1st we should be in Freetown, Sierra Leone, where we are\nassured of a pleasant stay, as it is the home town of Hilton Jarrett, the\nsoils oie nti st. At the moment (Sept.\n27th) we are only one day from Takoradi Harbour, In a freeling temperature of 76 F, on our way to a British a inter and a lot of work awaiting us.\nSTUDENT HOSTELS GOVERNMENT REPORT REVIEWED The University Grants Committee has\nrecently produced the report of its subcommittee cm Halls of Reslaonce. This\n50-page document published by Her Majesty' i HuMmtxy Office, is very good value for three shillings.\nIt discusses the whole problem of\nensuring that every student derive* tha\nfull benefits of a university life. It strongly advocated the provision of more\nHalls of Residence as the means of doing\nthis. Only when all students spend a period in residence (the report recommends\nat least two years and preferably mare)\nwill the bru w n bagging9 to 5 mentality\nbe eradicated.\nThe vital educational role of hostel\nlife should be of great interest to\nImperial College, for whose students ten\nof so new hostel units, each containing\nabout 90 residents, are to be build in Prince* Gardens during the next few (?)\nyears.\nThe booklet discusses a student\nwho, having just left school, continues\nto live at hone whilst attending college.\nTo him are denied \"the stimulus of fresh\nscenes, the exhilaration of independence,\nthe sense that a new adventurous phase of\nlife is pending\"'. Digs may have the\nadvantage of being much doses- to oo lle ge, but are a very poor second to living in a hostel. They are liable to be ex pensi ve, and acme are squalid and difficult to work In. As the report says, \"digs\ndo nothing to help a student to interpret the w niv or s it y world\". It goes\non to emphasise the \" civil ising and\nhuman ising\" influence of a hostel. Half\nof a student's university education is obtained in his college department, the\nother half, equally important, by mixing\nwith his fellow students. Only a resident\no an appreciate the second half fully. He\no an obtain a thorough interchange of ideas\nwith his fellows and can benefit from an\nunderstanding of the co-operation and\nteamwork wh i oh spring from living in a student community.\nThe report recommends a mixture of\nall \"years\" and postgraduates in hostels,\nand emphasises tha importance of a sprinkling of staff, as well, in order to improve staff-student relationships. Members of staff should act as \"moral tutors*\nto the students.\nA hostel depends a great deal, says\nthe report, on the pre a on ali ty of its\nwarden. Bis must he resilient! And host\nThe sub-oom mitte c thinks that the post\nof warden should be held in university\nstatus: that the onetime possession of\na warden a hip should count favourably whan\nSfppedataents to professor e hips are Being\nmade. This produces one Implication\nwh i oh will have to be watched carefully\nat X.C. Hitherto ear wardens and sab-wardens have been asm with.a genuine aad\nactive interest in student affairs: they\nhave taken on the job more as a be any than for money. Hew it seen a possible\nthat an aafc it ioe a academician may seek a warden ship for purely professional ends,\nand it is unlikely that he would make a satisfactory and tolerant warden. It ia\nto he hoped that there will always be ea J V fic dent staff to take on ward on shias far\nthe fun and great interest i to an provide rather than possible promotion later.\nThe report also attempts to discuss\nthe possible impact of a large residential\npopulation! in various halls, each holding\nabout 100, en college life in general.\nBare it is impossible to general is e on\nthe complementary functions of halls and\nunions: 80 much depends on the distance\nthat the halls are fro a the college\ncentre, the existence of an active union\netc., and this is different for every\nuniversity in the country. The report\nspeaks of athletic clubs run by each hall: students not actually in residence would\nbe considered as 'associate members* of\na hall for this purpose, with the right\nto use lounges and fl-t rH wg rooms in the\nhall. This, no doubt, is a reasonable\nidea for a oo lle ge or university \u2022where\nthe halls are scattered and remote from\nthe Union or social center. But at I.C., with a large and active Union, which\ndivides naturally into the three constituent oo lle ge unions when the situation\nor numbers demand, it seems unlikely that\nany of the halls in Princes Gardens will feel any need to organise their own\nmajor activities. The I.C. Governing Body\nreport, 1955-56, emphasised that the\nPrinces Gardens project was designed to\nencourage the corporate feeling of the\noo lle ge as a whole, and all residents\nwould use the same refectories and lounges.\nNevertheless each hall will need acme\nsort of administering committee, like the\npresent hostel's Resident's Committee\nwh i oh, happily, contains a considerably\ngreater student representation than the\nU.G,C'& report appears to think right a and proper.\nThis sub-committee's report has been\nbased on evidence received from many universities and colleges. The university\nGrants Committee visited I.C. in November,\n1955, and it is very satisfactory to recall that the Union Council's mem or and u a to\nthe ooo Bit tee was devoted entirely to\na request for more halls of residence,\nfor reasons similar to those described\nin acme sections of this report. The\npurchase of Princes Gardens followed a few months later. This Council was\nsubjected to the perennial and totally irrelevant criticism that it contained\ntoo many sporting and ball-games types.\nThey certainly seem to have hit the ball good and hard on this occasion.\nTHE GARDEN HOSTEL\n\n"

Ths standard of the trialist s was good hut there were few players of\nfirst team standard. College football\nis faster and more robust than the\nfootball played at most schools, and\nwhen the freshmen become accustomed to\nthe change than more will qualify for places in the top teams. It is therefore better that these players are\nse leo ted for lower teams at first, but\nthis will not mean that their claims\nto better football will be forgotten.\nAbout 110 students have indicated\ntheir wish to play football for the\nCollege. It is impossible for ths club\nto include everybody at first, but\nselection of tho teams will be as fair as possible, entirely on ability, and\nthe competition for places should prove\na great incentive to everyone.\nRUGBY\nThe Club'i. trials, wh i oh were hold\nat Harlington on Wednesday and Saturday,\nwere very successful and attracted well\nover 100 players. This year's First Eleven should be as strong as ever and\nthe lower teams, apart from a certain\nshortage of full-backs and fly-halves,\nshould also do well.\nTeams for Saturdays are normally\nposted on the Rugby Club notice board on\nTuesday lunch tl mes. Flayers are asked\nto look at this notice board, w hio his just outside the Bar, early in the week\nand not leave it until Friday afternoon.\nIf available for the match, players\nshould put a tick beside their names\nand if not available, a cross. It is essential that players whose names\nappear on the reserve list should also\ntick off as no Club o an function without reserves. Fast experience has shown\nthat almost every reserve who ticks off\ngets a game; any reserve who ticks off\ntwo weeks in succession will be picked\nfor a side in the third week.\nPlayers who went to the U.L. trials and who now want to play for I.C. should\nsign the list they will find on the\nnotice board.\nRugby fixtures ( first team):\nSat.Oct. 12 th.\nWed.0ct.16 th.

CROSSCOUNTRY\nSo far this season ths Crosscountry\nClub has had no competitive fixtures,\nbut two trials have been held. If the\nfresher s fulfil the promise they have\nshown in the trials, we o an perhaps hops\nfor another season as successful ss the\nls st, when we won the university Championship and were seo on d in the Hyde Park\nRoad Relay.\nTwo very useful additions to our\nmembership are R.C. Landbeck (ex-South-amp ton) and J. F. Jaeger (ex-Cambridge),\nand also fresher s A. Brown, A. Brash and\nK. Ludlam showed considerable promise.\nHowever, of greater importance, is the\nfact that the Club has gained a fairly large number of fresher s of moderate\nability who will form the packing\nstrength of the Club in the future.\nCrosscountry fixtures ( first team):\nSat.Oct.12th.

Following this\npleasant event, the more serious\nside of the sport has got into full swing with six Fresher crews being\nboated and tanked on Saturday.\nThe Morphy and Lowry crews have\nalready started their training for November 6th. Morphy Day. These poor\npeople have to row at 8.00 am. for the\nhonour of their constituent College on\nthree mornings a week.\n\"Greater love hath no man''\nRIDING CLUB\nDuring the recent vac. three members\nof the Club spent an eventful 16 days\ntrekking through Yorkshire, both high and\nlow, reo ei ving quite incredible hospitality\nat many of the farms visited. Visits wore\nmade to both racehorse and show jumping trainers, while the tour ended with a visit to the York Music Festival and a rids back\nto Burnley.\nThe only discomforts experienced were\ndue to non-waterproof tents (on two oc-cas ions), and ones or twice the nobis\nanimals mistook human feet for stones \u2014\nand trod on thorn.\nIt Is hoped to rids In a similar trek\non the continent next summer, probably in Swltssrlsnd.\nSAILING\n*Fom\u00bbl* \"wi\u00bba trophy\nOn 5 th. and 6 th. October racing at\nthe Welsh Harp was for open competition\nand entries arrived from nine Clubs\nscattered over the Thames area, in addition to the College, University, and\nlocal Clubs.\n\"Fumble* (Janet Stevens and Mike\nCollyer) got the winning gun in the\npractice race, and went on to win the\nWelsh Harp Sailing Association's Autumn\nTrophy from a fleet of 52 starters.\n(Note: The Trophy was won in1955 by\nsister ship \"fa mul us\", also I.C.^. \"Faust\", sailed by fresher Graham\nTaylor, received a consolation prize for\na good performance in very light airs,\nand we hope the Club may benefit from\nGraham's talent.\nFor the information of those who\ndo not already know, the names of the\nI.C. Sailing Club's boats are:\nFumble, Famulus, Faust, Furious, Felix\n( all National Firefly class).\nATHLETIC CLUB\nThough I. C.A.C. functions mainly in the summer term, it is hoped that members\n(and would-be members) will take an active\ninterest in the Club In the winter terms.\nWeight-lifting and circuit training fac-ili ties will be provided as soon as the\nI.C. and U.

One fixture takes place this term.\nThis is the University's third Winter\nfield Events and Relays Competion. Last\nyear we lost the\"TJalve Trophy\" for field events to Middlesex Hospital and were\nsecond in the relays. We particularly\nrequest F.E. men to reserve Wed. 13th Nov. to add their support to the I.C. team. By strengthening our F.E. section,\nespecially in the Jumping events,we can\ngo a long way towards achieving our aim\nof regaining our title of University\nchampions-which was lo at to University\nCollege last year.\nThe attention of all members,old\nor new,of any standard,and whether interested in the Winter meeting or not,is\ndrawn to the Atfeletio Club lot ioe Board\n(situated outside the Bar) where a notice concerning all is exhibited.\nPublishes by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College Union, London.

    "content": "FELIX7 VIEWPOINT\nOB September 29th, there appeared\nin. Reynolds News an article by a Dr.\nBrian Welbeck assailing our educational\nsystem and the products thereof, with\nparticular emphasis on the scientific and technological aspects, bringing up\nsome points quite commonly met with.\nDr. Welbeok asserted that present-day sixth-former s suffer from a surfeit\nof sports and s cde noes. They are not\nbeing taught to think far themselves,\nbut merely have the contents of other\nmen's minds poured t into their own.\n\"Everything that might Broaden the\nscholar's mind and encourage tv ft n to browse in wide pastures of culture,\nliterature and philosophy has he em drastically pruned. Latin and\n\u00a9reek and the wealth of human culture\nthat they open up are supp p sed to be\ndead subjects? It appears to us necessary to point out, once and for all, that literature and philosophy, Latin\nand Greek just do not constitutes everything that might broaden a scholar's mind. Does this insistence on teaching\nthe culture of the past, while young\nminds are being actively stimulated\nby the scientific achievements that\nare taking place now (the Russian\nearth i satellite provides a topical\nexample) betray some rather out-of-touch i wishful thinking? We shall return\nto this point.\n\"One can be a good technician\nwhile remaining something less than\nhuman, while being virtually uneducated\" writes Dr..Welbeck. Agreed.\nOne can. And who has not heard of\nthe lawyer, schooled in Greek and Latin,\nwho spends his time doing nothing but\nlooking up precedents.\n\"... a civilization is judged,\nnot by its machines of war, but by its creative artists, its l tier a ture, its philosophy and its poets\" Well, there\nhas been nothing new at the R.A. Summer\nExhibition for donkeys' years. How many\ngiants of literature and poetry are\nthere nowadays? Dr. Welbeck seems to realise that the Latin-Greek culture\nis dying a slow death \u2014 he does not\nrealise that it is being inevitably\nsuperseded by a new culture, with\nmathematics the living language; a culture appealing to the youth, of today because it signifies progress. He\ndoes not admit that Science is creative.\nReadi the newspapers, Dr. Welbeck. The\nonly creative people nowadays are Scient is ts and Technologists. When our civ-i liz ation is judged according to its works, the discoveries of the former\nand the more tangible monuments of the\nlatter will stamp this age as the re-na is s ance. Dr. Welbeck goes on: \"\nWe honour\nthe Romans not because they were skilled engineers but because they laid th\nfoundations of Civil Law? Do the\na e nee fu eta deserve no honour? \"Comparing\nour a alva s with, the kidd le Ages which\nproduced the Cathedrals, we must blush\nto think that the best we o an show are\nmonstrous office blocks and the intercontinental ball is tie missile\" One need\nnot quote examples to show that Dr.\nWelbeok is here comp e ring the best of\none world with the worst of another. A scientific education would have taught\nhim objectivity, while one might hear i a Bind that in those same Middle Ages\nGalileo Galilei was. persecuted and\nimprisoned for supporting the view that\nthe planets revolved round the sun.\n\"The 19th century ... produced MEN\n... men who were not afraid to think\nwidely, to challenge accepted citadels\nof thought...\" Were not the atomic\ntheory and the quantum theory evolved\nby such men? Asa. are not today's citadels being challenged by Scientists?\nDr. Welbeok has already stated his\npreference for the Civil Law of the\nRomans and the architecture of the Middle Ages.\nuna final quotation: \"Today we turn\nout, by the score, conveyor-built pimply-faced little scientists and chemists who\nthink that the whole world is Bounded by\na test-tube! Welbeck has no weapon save\nridicule with which to attack us. Heaven\nhelp him. His article, like too many\nothers, conjures up a picture, of a man\nrunning round in circles, sensing that\nhe has lost something but ignorant of what he seeks and how to find it. unable\nto face the future, he takes refuge\nbehind a door that is very nearly closed.\nDemocritus II.
