Till death do us part...\" These arc the\nwords which usually accompany one of the\nbiggest decisions in a person's life. For most\nundergraduates at Imperial, it's a choice that\nstill seems a long way off. But look carefully,\nand you may find a few who have already tied\nthe knot for potentially a lifetime.\nSo who are these\nbrave, and quite possibly\nfoolish, souls? And just\nwhy did they do it? Well,\nit seems for all the right\nand proper reasons. Girl\nmeets boy, girl and boy\nfall in love, girl marries\nboy. But do boy and girl\nlive happily ever after?\nPerhaps.

For a start, young children\nare only bundles of joy\nwhen they're not\ncrying their heads off\nfor no reason at all, food, or the latest GI\nBarbie doll (like\nAction Man, but PC).\nForget about a child\nwhile studying unless\nyou like being woken\nup at 4am regularly,\nand don't mind occasionally handing in\ncoursework that's been chewed by baby\nteeth.

In fact, it was yes, maybe\nand no, which tells us that love is a confusing\nanimal if nothing else. The yes camp seemed\nto be the romantics. The cautious maybes said\nthat it was fine as long as both parties knew\nexactly what they were letting themselves in\nfor. The no camp were the realists, who\nargued that dd wait: people are still\ngrowing and developing, quite possibly in\ndifferent directions. By the time you graduate,\nyour partner may have become someone you\njust can't get on with.\nI 'IV It's not my place to\nsay; I have no experience in the matter.

    "content": "News\nFracas In Library\nBY DAVE COHEN\nViolence erupted in the\nDepartment of Mathematics\nLibrary, last Thursday after two\nstudents became involved in a brawl.\nJust after 12:30pm, on\nThursday 24th November, Bilal\nAl-ali, a Mathematics\nPostgraduate, was sitting in the\nlibrary working when he was\napproached by Seye Ontiri, an\nex-Imperial student now\nstudying at Southbank\nUniversity. After a short scuffle a fight broke out between the two\nmen, during which Mr Al-ali\nsuffered a cut to the brow. Ayse\nSantliturk, Assistant Librarian,\ncalled College security who soon\nbroke up the fight. \"I didn't know [Mr Al-ali] until that day,\nhe was just a quiet, normal\nstudent,\" said Mrs Santliturk.\nWitnesses said that despite an\nattempt by Mr Al-ali to move the\nfight outside the library, Mr Ontiri seemed resolute in\nsettling the matter immediately.\nAdrian Clark, Librarian, said:\n\"Obviously [Ontiri] didn't care\nthat it could be in a public\nplace.\"\nAlthough the motives\nbehind the fight are unclear at\npresent, College security have\ninformed FELIX that the\nmatter has been referred to the\nSouthbank University authorities and investigations are in\nprogress. Staff in the\nMathematics Department said\nthat the matter was being taken\nvery seriously in light of the\nletter by Mr Ontiri, published in\nlast week's FELIX. The letter\nwas written, in defense of the\nWing Chun Kung Fu club, as a reply to a previous anonymous\nletter ( FELIX1 O1O) which\ncriticised the claims and motives\nof the club, as had been outlined\nin recent advertisements in\nFELIX.\nFees Freeze\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nGillian Shephard, the Education\nSecretary, disclosed in her\nbudget statement on Tuesday\nthat the level of tuition fees will\nbe frozen this year.\nIn a statement that\nconfirmed the Government's commitment to replacing\nstudent grants with loans, Mrs\nShephard also announced that\nthere will be a freeze on\nuniversity places for at least the\nnext three years. The planned\nstudent numbers have been\nreduced by 2,000 for 1995-96 and\nby 7,000 for 1996-97 compared\nwith the figures announced in\nlast year's budget. Grants will be\nreduced by 8% next year, further\nto this year's10% cut. The\nmaximum student loan will rise\naccordingly.\nOther measures being\nintroduced by the Department of\nEducation include reductions in\ngrants for mature students who\nhave no dependants. In addition,\nstudents who study in London\nand live away from home, but\nwho could conveniently live with\ntheir parents while at college will\nbe faced with smaller loans. The\nexact figures for these measures\nhave yet to be announced.\nOverall funding for the\nDepartment of Education rose by\n1% in real terms. \"In a unified\nbudget which has demonstrated\nthe Government's determination\nto maintain strict control over\npublic expenditure, we have once\nagain given priority to\neducation,\" said Mrs Shephard.\nIn reply, David Blunkett,\nthe Shadow Education Secretary,\nsaid that the budget had \"failed\nschools and colleges and is bad\nnews for pupils and students\".\nHe described the operation of\nthe Student Loan Company as\n'completely sham boli c' and\ncalled for a review of the whole\nsystem of student support. \"In\nthe meantime,\" he said.\n\"Students face increasing\nhardship with inadequate and\nineffective arrangements for\nmaintenance.\"\n1 '\ni: Today sees the culmination of Imperial College's Welfare Week, writes Pau\nDias, which was chosen to coincide with yesterday's World Aids Day. The\nweek featured a host of exciting events and informative stalls, including\nIC Day Nursery stall pictured above.\n(Beit Brawl continues from page one)\nFollowing a review of Friday\nnights proceedings, Showsec\nInternational, the company\nwhose employees were used at\nthe beginning of the term, will\nonce again be in evidence at\nUnion events. Lucy Chothia,\nICU President, has defended\nthese measures, saying that they\nare necessary since three of the\ninjured stewards will not be\navailable to work for some time.\nCriticism of college security\ncentres on questions over one\nofficer's state at the time of the\nincident, and continuing\nuncertainty over how many\nofficers were in the Quad at the\ntime. Terry Briley, Deputy Head\nof Security, insisted that two\nofficers were on duty that\nevening. However, this has\nconfused many of those present,\nwho claim that only one officer\nwas seen. Mr Briley appeared\nshocked upon hearing\nallegations of drinking by one of\nhis officers, and emphasised that\nhe had not received any\ncomplaints of this nature.\nWith confusion also\nsurrounding whether college\nsecurity called the police when\nrequested by the Union stewards,\nthe lack of involvement by\nsecurity officers during the\nmelee has been criticised. Whilst\nMr Briley insists that his officers\nattended the injured, the reasons\nwhy they were not further\ninvolved at the time of the\nassault has not yet been fully\nexplained.\nIf the police were contacted,\nas Mr Briley insists, soon after\nthe violence started, then it is the\npolice whose actions warrant\nquestioning. They did not appear\nuntil around 3am, after the three\nassailants had finally left Prince\nConsort Road. If the lack of\npolice presence was due to their\nslow reaction, then college\nsecurity cannot face any\ncriticism in this respect.\nAs part of the ongoing\nsecurity review, the one camera\nwhich is directed at the entrance\nto the Union building is being\ndeemed inadequate for security\npurposes. College Security has\nagreed with ICU that this will be\nrecorded, unlike at present, and\nthat further cameras, possibly\ninfra red, will be erected in the\nQuad. When these alterations\nwill take place has not been\ndecided, though Lucy Chothia\nhopes that it will be fitted in the\nnear future.\nFollowing strong suspicion\nthat one of the three persons\ninvolved is a first year Civil\nEngineer, two of the Union\nstewards have been studying\nstudent photographs. This has\nnot yielded any results so far,\nand Mr Briley, obviously\ncommitted to finding the\nculprits, has appealed to students\nwith any information to come\nforward. He emphasised that full\nconfidentiality would be\npreserved.\nmm FELIX02 D GC94 "

Mee, MBE, TD, BSc(Econ)\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION MEMBERSHIP AND OPTING OUT\nSince the time of its establishment, it has been the practice to regard all registered students of Imperial College as members of the Imperial College Union. The same arrangement has applied to the constituent College Unions. There has been no subscription or fee charged to students or their sponsors to secure membership. The College has funded ICU and the CCUs to enable the provision of a range of services and facilities for students sporting, cultural, recreational etc and students have been free to use or not use these services and facilities as they individually decided. However, under the provisions of the Education Act1994 the College is specifically obliged to make provision for students to opt out of membership\nof Student Unions. Moreover the College is charged with ensuring that any student who\nexercises the right to opt out should not be \" unfairly disadvantaged\" with regard to accessing services and facilities available to the rest of the student body.\nIn order to comply with this requirement, the College has agreed with ICU that ICU will act as the College \"agent\" in the provision of facilities and services for all our registered students. The College will continue to fund ICU and the CCUs on the traditional basis so that the normal provision of services and facilities is available to all registered students irrespective of whether they have formally opted out of Union membership or not. The only practical effect therefore of opting out will be that such\nstudents cannot stand for elected office or take part in Union elections. For this purpose the College needs to know and to keep a record of students who have opted out. Thus all registered students who wish to exercise their rights under\nthe Education Act1994 of formally opting out of ICU and CCU membership for the session199495 are required to come to the Registry( Room 343 on level3 of the S her field Building) by Monday 9 January1995( the beginning of the Spring Term) to record their decision./ J PE Mee\nRegistrar30 November 1994\n\n"

    "content": "Standby\n^ real eve\nTim Burton' s the nightmare before Christmas is a film which\nyou get the feeling has been a long\ntime coming. Indeed Burton's original concept for a stop-motion\nanimation has grown from the\nstatus of a part-time labour of love\nto something approaching a full\nlength obsession. But thanks to the\nsuccess that he has crafted with the\nBatman series, Beetlejuice and\nEdward Scissorhands, Burton has\nbeen humour ed and in return he\nhas once again proved that his\nversion of gothic quirk in ess can\nmake money.\nThe fact that his name has as\nmuch prominence in the title as the\nnominal subject seems to suggest\nthat this film is the closest we have\ngot to the Burton psyche thus far.\n(Of course it could just be a cash-in\nopportunity.) To use the Branaghism\nof the moment; this is Burton's won\npersonal monster, and maybe that's why it's such a peculiar film in both\nword and deed.\nThe action starts in Halloweentown on the night of Halloween.\nYep, the ghouls are in full throttle\nand leading the fiery charge is their\nKing, Jack Skellington. It's in these\nfirst five or so minutes that the full\nglory of the stop-motion method of\nanimation is displayed. In a similar\nway to the opening swooping\ncamera shots on 'Batman returns',\nBurton sells his vision for all it's worth.\nHowever the longer the film\ngoes on, the more the mode of\nanimation becomes a burden\nespecially when stretched to seventy\nminutes. Equally the plot, relying as\nit does on the stage hall mode of\nimparting information through\nsongs and the limitations inherent\nin the use of puppets rather than\npeople, doesn't emote. Yes the\nconcept is very clever and the\nanimation is excellent but I got the\nimpression that Burton was doing\nexactly what he wanted to do. To\nthat degree this is a film designed\nto cater for b movie cult is ts and\ntechno ph re aks. The rest of us will\nfind it interesting, funny in parts,\ntechnically superb but then we'll go\nback and cry over Edward\nScissorhands.\nIn miracle on 34th street, one of the first of this season's festive films, Kriss Kringle (Richard\nAffenborough) tries to prove to a group of non-believers in New York\nCity that he is the real Santa Claus.\nThe story revolves around two\nrival department stores of which\none employs Kriss as their in-store\nSanta. He proves to be so\nridiculously successful that the rival\nstore attempts to 'blacken the good\nname' of Santa. By now the film has\nalready run on for far too long and\nwe have yet to even reach the\nclimatic and farcical court scene.\nWhat needs to be clearly\nindicated is that this is a film that is\nsolely aimed at children and is likely\nto be only enjoyed by those under\nthe age of 10. Anyone above this\nage ought to have acquired enough\ntaste to know when something is far\ntoo nauseatingly sentimental and\nmelodramatic for its own good. In\nparticular the child [Mara Wilson,\nthe brat in 'Mrs. doubtfire') is too\ncynical and irritatingly knowledge-able, and played in such a sickeningly cute manner with such a complete lack of ability that even\nSanta wouldn't touch her with a barge-pole (metaphorically speak-ing).\nAs with all films of this kind it is\ncompletely predictable and given\nthe film's length, it soon gets\nboring. In fact the film is exactly the\nsort of slush you expect John\nHughes to churn out ie. high on\ncuteness and kids, low on plot\ndevelopment, scripting and\nappalling stereotypical adult\ncharacter is at ions. In fact it's hard to\nfind anything positive to say about\nthe film, except maybe that it will\nteach Attenborough to stay behind\nthe camera considering the disaster\nwhich was his accent in 'Jurassic\nPark'.\nIn short, this is just another\nstandardised Hollywood 'feel-good'\nmovie for the Christmas period\nwhich is just as dull, predictable and\nunfunny as the rest. The blurb says\n\"discover the miracle\" but the only\nmiracle you'll discover is the strange\nand sudden reduction of cash from\nyour pocket.\nFor once there'll be no\nbeating around this one, trial by\njury is a rank film which by the end\nhas become plain nasty in tone.\nJoanne Whalley-Kilmer takes\nthe millstone of playing Valerie, a single mother who does jury service\non a godfather murder trial because\nshe believes in duty, paying taxes,\nthe american way and apple pie for\ndinner. Of course the mobster\ndecides to put pressure on her by\nthreatening her young son, and her\ndear ol' dad. Too frightened to go\nto the police Valerie decides to\nhang the jury so the mobster,\nhilariously called Rusty, goes free,\neven though in the meantime he\nhas managed to rape her.\nWhat more could happen\nscream a frantically spelled bound\naudience? Now that Valerie has\nendured all this she can easily avoid\nbeing killed by the mobster's double cross before wandering out\nto his secret hide out, where she\nshows him some leg and sticks an\nice pick in his neck. It's a film bad\nenough to make you wish for\n'Natural born killers'. Well almost\u00a9\nno roar\nQuantity is a poor substitute for\nquality in food. At \u00a34.50 for lunch,\nthe Paper Tiger provides superb\nquantity for money, with a ten-course Chinese buffet allowing\nyou to eat as much as you want.\nBut how much will you want to eat?\nThe clear vegetable broth is\nprobably the best dish on offer. It\nis hot and digestible but lacks\nflavour, with only a few vegetables\nswimming in the tureen.\nGrease came next, served\nwith spring rolls and chicken\nwings. The spring rolls were hot\nand crispy but totally lacking in\nfilling and saturated in cooking oil.\nThe chicken wings would have\nbeen more at home in Kentucky\nFried Chicken, having a strange\noriental/american coating.\nWith soup and starter over\nand a gallon of water to clean our\npalates, the stainless steel\ncontainers holding the main\ncourses beckoned. Rice and\nnoodles sat overcooked and\nstodgy waiting to meet their\naccompaniments. With a choice of\nfour main dishes, three containing\nmeat, the options for vegetarians\nwere limited - an uninspiring\ncombination of stir-fried\nvegetables, which had turned into\nstir-stewed vegetables as they sat\nin the container. The beef in black\nbean sauce, sweet and sour pork\nand chicken curry fared no better\nunder the pressures of the buffet\ntable.\nStir-fried dishes are meant to\nbe cooked quickly, served quickly\nand eaten quickly, not left in a pot\nto survive a whole lunchtime. The\ncourses were brimming with the\nflavouring enhancer MSG, but\nthere was very little flavour to\nenhance. The meat and\nvegetables were overcooked; the\nsauces were glutinous, clinging to\nthe mouth because of heavy-handed corn flour use. The latter a desperate attempt to add body to\nthe emaciated flavours.\nAnd that was the end of the\nten courses as advertised on the\nboard outside. With rice, noodles\nand wanton considered courses in\ntheir own right, the evidence of\nvalue for money suddenly became\nless convincing.\nThe food at the Paper Tiger is\nat best comparable to a dod gy Chinese take away. If you are in\nthat kind of mood and are very\nhungry, then it's worth a visit. But\nas value for money goes, there are\nfar better offers available. \u00a9\nThe Paper Tiger, 74 Exhibition\nRoad, SW7\n02DEC94 FELIX "

    "content": "BackChat\nIn the Palm of\nhis Hand\nAfter Trinity College, Cambridge, David Potter came to Imperial to do\niii it K IlillllM\nli ill ll \u00ae\nThe wilds of Edgeware Road could be\nconsidered a strange place to find a high-tec\nBritish computer company, but that's where\nyou'll find Psion. Actually anywhere could be\nconsidered a strange place to find a British\ncomputer company, a fact that David Potter,\nthe chairman of Psion, is all too aware of.\nThe City, he explains, are always asking him\n'when are you going to die?' - \"that's the\ncompany not me\" he adds with a grin. But\ntwenty years on from their one-man start,\nPsion show no sign that they are about to die.\nDavid Potter was born in South Africa\nbut moved to what was then Rhodesia. From\nthere his first taste of British life was the\nrarefied atmosphere of Trinity College,\nCambridge. Did he experience a culture\nshock? \"I kind of suffered the opposite\nexperience of Van Gogh and Gauguin\", he\nstarts. Maybe he sees my eyes start to open\nwide with disbelief at this easy mention of\ntwo post impressionist painters as he quickly\nadds, \"coming from sun and\nbright colours and light to\nOctober ... where the sky was real\nlow, like it is today and black\nand murky.\" It doesn't take you\nlong to realise that David is well\neducated. Indeed during our\ninterview he also mentions\nMozart, the classical physicists of\nthe nineteenth century and a broad chunk of western political\nhistory.\nAfter Cambridge, David\ncame to Imperial to do a Ph.d in\nplasma physics. It was then that he begin to\nuse computers to study complex non-linear\nproblems. \"At that time\", he says, \"they were\nbig mainframes which cost millions of\npounds ... and they were treated like oracles\nwith priesthoods around them\". In contrast,\nPsion, with their Series 3, are now producing\nsome of the smallest computers around. It's a measure both of technical change and the\ndrive to portable, personal technology, the\nlatter being something which is obviously\nclose to David's heart.\nDuring his time at IC, David didn't waste time but got involved in what has been\nthe springboard to many brilliant careers.\nWell actually, if the truth be told David was a bit of a FELIX hack and he even rose to the\ngrand position of editor in 1967. So after his\nexperience at two of Britain's premier\nuniversities what did he think about the\n'Imperial apathy problem'?\n\"Well I think that undergraduates talk\nlike that\" he starts, \"but I don't think that\ngraduate students do and I don't think that\nthe staff does. But the undergraduates do, but\nthey also talk like that at Cambridge and at\nOxford and at Birmingham and everywhere.\"\nIt's the start of a long and passionate speech\non the narrowness of the British education\nsystem and how that produces \"a tendency to\nhide any kind of intellectualism with the\npretence to be gross; the hooray henry s of\nthis world. IC had beer drinking and all the\nrest of it, which is fun, there's nothing wrong\nwith that but when it becomes an anti-intellectualism and a cynicism this is\nunhealthy\".\nAfter Imperial David spent some time\nover in America at UCLA before coming\nback to Britain in 1975. He started up Psion\nusing capital he had gained by investing in\nthe post '74 crash stock market. Within a year\nhe was operating at a profit.\nIn those early days Psion distributed\nand marketed other people's software in the\n'home microcomputer market'. They then\nstarted writing their own software, so\nsuccessfully that by the start of the 1983\nPsion was \"probably the largest home\nsoftware producer in Britain\". It's at this\npoint that David goes over to his 'historical\ncabinet' and gets out a cassette. \"This flight\nsimulator sold about million and a half units\"\nhe says, and I recognise the small tape which\npropelled my teenage imagination to believe\nthat I was a hero of the skies.\nAfter the crash of Sinclair in the\nmiddle '80s Psion turned their attention first\nto the electronic organiser and\nthen the palm top computer\nmarket. So what does David think\nabout the increasing drive for\npersonal connective ness, whether\nby mobile phone or portable\ncomputer?\nHe has a radical proposal. \"I actually want to start a new\nbusiness\" he begins \"which is\nhospitals for young infants. We\noffer ten days after birth they can\ncome in and we'll implant a cellular phone in their head.\" I finally realise that he is gently winding me\nup and David laughs at my interruption, \"it's what God missed out on\" he protests.\nWe end up talking about the impact of\ntechnology on society and the man-machine\nrelationship. David's view is that \"the\nrelationship of the human individual to the\nmachine can not be socially destructive\", but\nI'm not so sure. Of course the pragmatic view\nis that whatever your view no-one can control\nthe broad progress of technology anyway.\nDavid ends by saying, \"I think the\nfuture's fun. I do find the changing world\ninteresting and fun and I think it's a much\nbetter world than when I was a kid\". He's probably right too. Q02D GC94 FELIX MM\n\n"

What\nwas it they were saying about\neducation?\nSitting on the bus, I was\ntroubled for a second or two by\nthe state of schooling and the\nMinistry of Education's knee-jerk\nsolutions. League tables are great\nif all you're comparing is boys\nkicking leather. Trying to quantify\nthe quality of education though,\ndoes make me shudder. Just think\nback to Dead Poets Society and\nthe plotting of a poem's merits on\nx and y axes.\nMy muses were interrupted\nby the exuberant conversation of\nsome schoolboys. Oh, alright,\ntheirs was the only chat my\nstraining ears could pick up.\n\"There ain't no point\", began one\n(and in a distant stadium, some\ngrey haired old men smiled\nknowingly), \"in buying just the one\nlottery ticket.\"\nWhat?! Had these children\nof the microchip era cracked the\nsystem and was I going to\neavesdrop the secret?\n\"'Cos the odds of winning\nare 14,000,000 to one aren't they?\" Well, 13,983,816 to one to\nbe precise; no, I said I'd prefer\n'Big Boy...'\n\"So you may as well spend\nan extra pound and get 'em down\nto 7,000,000 to one.\"\nOh dear. I didn't have the\nheart to shatter their illusions but\nhas anyone got the number for\nHM inspectors?\nRahul\nTHE DOCKER' S FIST People moan a lot. I cannot exempt\nmyself from this by any means, in\nfact I would say that complaint and\nbitterness are two things at twenty\none that I have actually got to grips\nwith. My flat-mate was moaning\nabout the fact that we have no\ndishwasher or microwave in our\nkitchen, an argument which while\nessentially flawless, is totally\nmeaningless as we are about as\nlikely to go out and buy mobile\nphones as go out and buy a dishwasher.\nThis however set me thinking\nabout my position in life, an\napproach often termed as the half\nempty glass theory. I look at people\nwith the view that they want\nsomething, but they haven't asked\nfor it yet. This, I know, is probably\nall paranoid dysfunction, but I actually do look at things that way.\nSo when I came to think about the\nthings that I like, off the top of my\nhead I couldn't think of any.\nThere is a Robert Altman film\ncalled Bill Durham, in which Kevin\nCostner delivers an insipid little\nsoliloquy about what he believes\nin. \"\nI believe that one man shot\nKennedy\", etc. A banal diatribe\nindeed, and one which Altman\nwrote on a whim when his original\nscene was all wrong; he has\nsubsequently tried to have it\nremoved from the film, but of\ncourse, the studio loved it and\namericans the world over have\nbeen quoting it to their unnecessary friends and womenfolk ever\nsince it hit a cinema screen. My\npoint is that people find it difficult\nto enthuse about anything without\nsounding crass and ironic.\nI have attempted to list my\ntop twenty things, which at great\nrisk to my own credibility, are by no\nmeans ironic, and an honest\nattempt at not being such a miserable bastard.\nGlyph\n1.

I too\nwas unsure about the sincerity of\nMarcus Alexanders comments (18th Nov). My first thoughts were that\nhe did have his \"tongue placed\nfirmly in his cheek\". However after\nreading the letter and comments\nthrough a few times I decided that\nhe was sincere, although I was not\nquite sure about the \"round of\napplause for special Branch\" part.\nPlease put the record straight Mr\nAlexander.\nThe point about the\ncriminal is ation of \"Peaceful\nDemonstration\" is interesting. If Mr\nRamsden had any grip on reality he\nwould know that a member of\ndemonstrations are far from\npeaceful. Is it any wonder that the\ngovernment seem to criminal is e demonstration after the anti\nCriminal Justice Bill demonstration\nfiasco some weeks ago? (of which\nthe editor was a part) The fact is\nthat most people in Britain are law\nabiding citizens who do have\nrespect for authority and I reject\nthe idea that my previous letter\nwas a 'piece of self abasing\nauthority worship' - I have always\nmade up my own mind on such\nmatters and I do not blindly follow\nauthority. Has it not occurred to\neither Mr Ramsden or the editor\nthat as people grow increasingly\ntired of these demonstrations, then\nthe causes for which they stand\nbecome more and more opposed\nby the population and those who\ngovern. A demonstration is no way\nto gain public support. There are\nways and means of protesting\nabout problem in a proper manner\nand I believe that they are far more\nlikely to have an effect than\nmarching through the streets of\nLondon. Marcus Alexander is\ncorrect when he says that we must\nwork with the system if things are\nto change. I would be the first to\nadmit that Britain is far from\nperfect, but I wonder how many\ntimes the protesters have written to\nM.P.s or have been to lobby them\nat Parliament. You do not have to\nbuy a suit.\nIt may also be worth considering\nthat not all people in Britain are\nlong haired middle class students.\nRichard M. Phillips\nGeol. Ill\nFirstly, thanks for carrying the torch\nRichard - we'll make the letters\npage a place of debate yet! Luckily,\nto this end I still disagree with the\nthrust of your argument...\nI think discussion about whether\nit is useful to one's cause demonstrate in a public place is a red\nherring. A personal decision, it\nshould have been left as such. The\nquestion is should a mass statement\nin the form of a protest be made\nillegal? Again, the argument about\nthe perceived violent inclinations of\nprotest members is irrelevant. We\nhave adequate laws dealing with\nviolence, public disorder, theft and\nvandalism and those laws should be\napplied to each particular case\nrather than something be banned\nfor the supposed reason that such\nactivities may stem from it. A wide\nvariety of activities may lead to\nthese crimes - football matches,\ncarnivals and bank transactions for\nexample, but for the sake of society\nand common sense they are not\nbanned outright.\nThe real strength in protest is\nthat it is solidifies ones feeling of\ninvolvement. To our generation, the\ndisenfranchised nature of politics is\nacute. Since early childhood one\nparty has governed and this lack of\nchange has, I would argue, been to\nthe detriment of those of all political\npersuasions.

His lively mind and\ncontinued reading make him an academic\nwho gets noticed.\nThe event combines the best of old and\nnew, with traditional carols, mulled wine,\nminced pies and an elderly clergyman, in\nconjunction with dance music, video clips\nand various computer-generated offerings.\nBuilding on last year's \"Virgin on the\nSpectacular\", it would never happen without\nthe cooperation of students, clubs and departments from IC & RCA, the generosity of various media companies and church officials\nwho allow us to turn the place upside-down.\n\"Virgin on the Unbelievable\" is at 6pm on Tuesday 13th December in Holy Trinity\nChurch next to the Union Building, Beit\nQuad.

Their\nwounds range from whiplash to\nhead injuries requiring stitches.\nThe incident originated in\nthe theft of a jacket and wallet\nbelonging to Neil Stewart, a postdoctoral researcher,\nfollowing which both the police\nand college security were\ninformed. Three males,\nsuspected by onlookers of being\ninvolved in the offense, were\nseen in the Beit Quad, after the\nUnion building had been\ncleared.\nFollowing their drunken\nbehaviour being noticed by the\nstewards, it has been claimed\nthat a college technician accused\nthe three males of the theft. It\nappears that they subsequently\nattacked him.\nThis resulted in the Union\nstewards, all six of whom were in\nthe Quad at the time, attempting\nto break up the fight and it was\nthen that they received their\ninjuries. Following the attack on\nFiona Grandison, from which\nshe suffered whiplash, one\nsteward suffered a broken bone\nin his hand while attempting to\nsubdue the assailants.\n(Continued on page 2)\nAshdown a Technophile\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAM Paddy Ashdown, Leader of the\nLiberal Democrats, gave the\nannual Save British Science\nlecture last Thursday. To the\nmeeting in Imperial College's Great Hall, Mr Ashdown\nreaffirmed his commitment to\nthe funding of education and\nresearch. In his speech he said\nthat financing education was the\nLiberal Democrat's first priority;\nbut when questioned later he\nadmitted that the party's main\nemphasis is still constitutional\nchange.\nPaddy Ashdown mainly\nspoke of the need to link\nindustry and education so that\nBritain could compete in world\nmarkets. However, he also felt\nQ news one&two&three \u2022 editorial&credits three \u2022 incoming five \u2022\nclued Up six \u2022 the s files seven \u2022 funny talk eight \u2022 back chat: David\nPotter nine \u2022 double feature: Love and Marriage ten&eleven \u2022 xtra\ncurricular twelve&thirteen \u2022 standby fourteen&fifteen&sixteen \u2022 seven day guide eighteen&nineteen \u2022 sport twenty B that Universities should not,\n\"spend their time doing 'useful'\nshort-term applied research for\nindustry\". He said this ought to\nbe industry's responsibility, so\nthat academic institutions could\nconcentrate on what he\ndescribed as, \"'blue-sky'\nresearch, which provides new\nideas for tomorrow\". He spoke of\ncopying the German system\nwhere the Government\ncontributes to the salaries of\nscientists in small firms for up to\nfive years.\nHe was also asked his views\non student finance, and in\nparticular on graduate tax.\nProposals being considered by\nthe Liberal Democrats could\nmean that graduates would pay a higher rate of income tax after\ntheir degrees were completed.\nMr Ashdown said that it was\nimpractical to give grants to all\nstudents at 1979 levels as this\nwould cost over \u00a37 billion.\nIn what seemed an attempt\nto impress his audience with his\nscience credentials the leader of\nthe Liberal Democrats described\nhimself as a 'complete technology freak!' who enjoyed\nplaying around on the Internet.\n\"The wonderful quality of the\nInternet is that it is completely\nout of control,\" he continued.\nRecognising the need to\nprepare students for college and\nUniversity, he noted that\nscientists often find themselves\n\"locked into a narrow career\npath\" by doing only one type of\nsubject. To counterbalance this,\nhe said that the Liberal\nDemocrats would like to broaden\nA levels into something more\nlike the International\nBaccalaureate. This would\ncompel those who concentrate on\nthe arts to broaden their\nhorizons as it would have a compulsory maths and science\nelement.\n\n"

(Wales beat Italy by the way, for all\nthose Italians who thought that Wales was\njust a great footballing nation!). We also went\nto see Dafydd Iwan and his band play in\nGray's Inn Road - probably the most famous\nWelsh singer of all time. It was a chance to\npractice our vocal chords (no stereotyping\nplease!) and to have a couple of Felinfoel\nDouble Dragons.

    "content": "a motherland's stature\nThe English Nation Opera's production of Khovanshchina is\nthe hit the new management have\nbeen looking for since their\nappointment more than a year\nago. Mussorgsky's epic 'The\nKhovansky Affair' is a loose\ntranslation set in the turbulent\nreign of Peter the Great. The Tsar\nhimself never appears, due to a law in force at the time of writing\nwhich forbade the depiction on\nstage of members of the Romanov\ndynasty. The characters are a mixture of reactionary religious\nzealots, Westernised reformers and\nmegalomaniac aristocrats. There's a lot of lamenting the fate of\nMother Russia and at the end\neveryone is worse off.\nPrince Ivan Khovansky (Willard\nWhite) towers head and shoulders\nabove a fine cast. Act III, the\nstrongest both musically and in\nFrancesco Zambello's imaginative\nproduction, begins with him\nstripped to his jockstrap in a swimming pool. This might not\nhave worked with an artist of\nlesser stature, but here it\ncompletes a portrait of a noble\nleader undone by his own vanity.\nEarlier, Khovansky's Act I entry\nprovides the first memorable\nmoment of the evening when\nAlison Chitty's stage set of\nmovable gantries splits open to\nreveal White surrounded by\nrearing metal horses and swirling\nblack flags.\nThe dark colours of\nShostakovich's orchestration\n(Mussorgsky's score was left\nunfinished) don't always captivate\nthe ear as they do on Abbado's awesome DG recording. But this is\nprobably more a tribute to what is\nhappening on stage than a criticism of music director Sian\nEdwards. The final scene is in all\nrespects the stunning culmination\nthat it should be. \u00a9\nwooden stock'94 So Woodstock II was a celebration\nof music and an attempt to\nrecreate a supposedly loving and\npeaceful atmosphere within the\nconfines of the money-obsessed\n'90s, eh? Yeah, right. If you\nbelieve that then you should stop\nreading right now because your\nwinning lottery number has just\ncome through...\nNo, Woodstock II was about\nmoney, from its well-publicised\nmythical intentions through to\nWoodstock '94, \"the single most\nextensive and technologically\nadvanced live event of all time\". In\nother words it was as decadent as\nthey come.\nMaybe there could be some\nkind of exoneration if the music\nwas any good but if this is the past\nand the future together then I'm glad I live in the now.\nSo what do you get for your\ntwenty quid (which of course will\nbe going straight into the\nanthropological, peace-lovin'\nclaws of the record company\nexecutives)? Well, there's the very\nf FELIX 02D GC94 good (Live with the aptly-titled,\n'Selling the Drama'), the extremely\nbad (Nine Inch Nails, Candlebox,\nSalt-N Pepa), and the downright\nugly (The Neville Brothers\nmurdering 'Come Together',\nMetallica, Joe Cocker).\nInterspersed between these\n'highlights' we are 'treated' to\nsome competent but ultimately\nuninspiring numbers courtesy of\nGreen Day, the Cranberries, Red\nHot Chili Peppers, Rollins Band\nand the like.\nAnd don't forget those token\ngestures - Bob Dylan, Traffic and\nPeter Gabriel - supposedly trying\nto bring some old-timers' nostalgic\ncredibility to the proceedings and\ninstead just sound as flaccid and\nlimp as many of their physical\nparts undoubtedly are.\nAnd there you have it. (Or if\nyou're sensible you don't have it.)\nIn answer to the question,\nWoodstock or Woodenstock? I think Crud-Stock would be much\nmore appropriate. Roll on 2019... I don't think. (3)\nMost readers of this page\nknow what New Order sound like\n- synthesised stuff sung by a blok e with a melancholic voice. However\nI would imagine most of you\ncouldn't name any of their songs\nexcept 'Blue monday' or 'True\nfaith'. This is therefore a greatest\nhits album full of songs which\nweren't hits - or were too long ago\nfor baby first years like me to\nremember. Obviously the album is\nlong overdue.\nI found this very hard to\nreview. The vinyl copy I was given\n(thanks to Charles for letting me\nborrow his record player) was a double album. You could say I'd be happy with just one of the discs.\nHalf the songs (the hits) are\nbrilliant and would get a(10) from\nme, an example being 'World in\nmotion'. The other half, the more\nmoody, low tempo stuff I just\nfound boring and rated it only (5).\nNew Order are the sort of\nband who have been around long\nenough to be an institution, but at\nthe end of the day all they'll be\nremembered for is the n different\nremixes of 'Blue monday'. (7)\nFollowing in the footsteps of\nseveral other singer-songwriters\ncomes Sarah McLachlan with her\nnew album, fumbling towards\necstasy. The work consists of\nthirteen all-too-similar ballads, all\ncentred around Sarah and her\npiano.\nThe style is similar to the likes\nof Tori Amos and Annie Lennox,\nand in some cases reminiscent of\nthe Cranberries. Unfortunately\nthough the music lacks the\nconviction of these contemporaries and you end up feeling\ncheated having been tempted with\nhints of what might have been.\nThe lyrics are introspective,\nand mostly examine relationships\nand self-worth. They are dull, and\nsink to all time low in the abysmal\n\"your love is better than ice\ncream\".\nI was unable to listen to this\nalbum all the way through, despite\nseveral attempts. It really is quite\nterrible. All the emotion becomes\nlost in a sea of banality, and it\nended up just boring me sh*t less. Go buy something decent instead\nlike the new Manic Street\nPreachers' album. (1) \u00a9\n\n"

Speaking to FELIX, Nicholas Black, the Estates\nManager, said that residents of\nthe block of flats directly\nopposite the Rector's residence\non Imperial College Road have\nreported disturbances and\ndamage to cars late at night: \"I had a very strong letter of\ncomplaint of the Chair of the\nResidents Association about\n'badge damage' to cars ...and\ngeneral horsing around.\"\nIn response, there has been a suggestion that the gates should\nbe locked, between 11pm and\n6am nightly, for a trial period.\nMr Black added that he had told\nthe Association that such a closure would inconvenience\ncertain students returning from\nCollege and the Union late at\nnight. For students in Evelyn\nGardens in particular, IC road is\na popular short cut. This, says\nMr Black, has led to allegations\nfrom residents that Imperial\nstudents were almost certainly\ncausing the damage. He believes\nthat certain other members of\nthe public are as likely to be\nresponsible as students.\nMr Black admitted that he\nsym pathis ed with the residents,\nand felt that other solutions,\nsuch as cameras or guards, would\nbe too expensive. 'This is a trade-off; I 've got disgruntled students\nversus disgruntled neighbours!'\nhe said in a statement to Lucy\nChothia, ICU President. T know\nwhere my priorities are, but it is\nvery difficult to make a case with\nan irate, damaged car owner'.\nHowever, he does not think that\nit would inconvenience many\nstudents, and has said that he\nwelcomes alternative suggestions. Also proposed has been\nthe closure of the Prince Consort\nRoad gates.\nMs Chothia said that she\nhad received details of the\nsuggested closures and had since\nreplied to the Estates Division.\n\"This is going to be a big\ninconvenience for all\nstudents...[the Estates Division]\ndon't agree with that,\" she said.\n\"There's very little reason for\ndoing it other than complaints\nfrom the local residents...I'd be\nvery interested to hear from any\nstudents with stronger views so I can represent them in college.\"\nNews In Brief\nBY PAUL DIAS\nMore Rag Mag Bans\nThis year's Imperial College Rag\nMag has been banned in a further four London colleges\nsince UL U outlawed it last week\n(see News, FELIX 1013). The\nmagazine, which features\nbizarrely modified male\ngenitalia, has now also been\nshunned by Goldsmiths Union,\nRoyal Holloway College Union,\nLondon School of Economics\nUnion and King's College Union.\nIn a further Rag Mag-related\ndevelopment, the London\nmedical schools St Guy's and St\nThomas's, and St George's have\nrequested as many copies as they\ncan get their hands on.\nExpeditions Calendar\nThe first ever calendar produced\nby the Imperial College\nExplorations Board will go on\nsale on Monday. The calendar\nfeatures spectacular colour\nphotographs of a selection of IC\nexpeditions from around the\nglobe. The pictures range from\ndramatic snow-lined peaks and\nslippery pot-holes to a transparent-winged butterfly and\nan 'unidentified fungus'. The\nImperial College Expeditions\nCalendar 1995 costs \u00a33.95 and\ncan be picked up in the Union\nBookstore on the walkway.\nNo Hockey Fine\nThe Imperial College Hockey\nClub will not be charged \u00a3115 for\nthe tampon-related damage\ncaused to ceiling tiles in Da\nVinci's bar (see News, FELIX1 O13). The Hockey Club\nthemselves painted over the\nbrown marks on the tiles, and it\nwas decided that these repairs\nwere sufficient, precluding the\nneed to buy new ones.\nJordan Fanzine Launched\nThis week saw the launch of a new American-music fanzine,\nproduced by Jon Jordan, who is a virtually permanent fixture in\nFELIX TOWERS. The\nfanzine, called 'And The Living\nIs Easy', features interviews with\nPavement, Yo La Tengo and\nLotion, along with reviews of\ngigs and albums. Jon says he has\nplans to produce four issues a year, and material for the late\nJanuary edition is already\npouring in. Jordan claims his\nfanzine is a \"bargain at only a pound!!!\", and is available now\nin the Union Newsagent on the\nwalkway.\n\u00a9JiforiaL\nFunding of Science\nShould Mr Ashdown be\ncommitted to funding science\nand 'blue sky' research? The\nobvious answer would be 'yes' -this is Imperial after all and\nbesides everyone always answers\nyes when asked (inverted\nOliver's) if they want some more.\nBut wouldn't it be fair to say\nthat science is, in fact, one of the\nmost financially backed of all\nfields of endeavour? Try getting\nextra money for a new art gallery,\nmusic or for the rebuilding of the\nBritish Film industry. It has\nbecome impossible for these\ninstitutions to walk about town\nwith anything other than a begging bowl. I suppose that it\ncould be argued that the National\nLottery has been set up to get the\nmoney to plough back into them,\nbut doesn't this highlight even\nmore clearly the arts precarious\nand irrelevant position?\nImagine if an MP from the\nDepartment of Trade and\nIndustry were seriously to\naddress the House of Commons\nas follows: \" My honourable\nfriend in the Treasury has\ninformed me that purse strings\nmust be pulled yet tighter this\nyear. Therefore we have decided\nto cut heavily on our\ncommitment to research and\ndevelopment work. Instead, we\nshall be introducing an annual\nhorse-racing event, widely\nadvertised and hosted by a top\ncelebrity has-been. The proceeds\nwill go to the funding of heart,\nlung and nuclear weapons\nresearch as well as our top\nscientific institutions. Therefore,\nI cannot confirm our fiscal\ncommitment to science this year,\nbut my good friend Peter Snow\nhas rigged up an excellent\npredictive forecast graph which\nyou will notice dropping down\nfrom the screen behind Madame\nSpeaker...\"\nThe truth is that science is\nnow in the same position as\nhealth, unemployment and law\nCredits\nEditor\nPrinter\nBusiness Manager\nAdvertising Manager\nEditorial Team\nOwain Bennallack\nAndy Thompson\nTim Bavister\nHelen Randall\nArt & Literature\nCinema\nClubs, Societies & Union\nColumns\nFeatures\nLayout and Design\nJon Jordan\nWei Lee\nPiers Daniell\nMarcus Alexander\nKate Cox\nPaul Dias\nand order.

    "content": "Feature\nHave Bass, Will Travel\nFELIX talks to comedian Jim Tavare, who heads the bill at 'the Bust-a Gut Club' next Friday.\nThis is the touching and totally untrue story\nof one man and his double bass. The parents\npleaded with him to reconsider (\"...look son,\nit'll never work; you're from a good home and\nshe's... well, she's just a lump of wood, not\neven an evergreen, for god's sake...\"); society\nlooked on in disapproval - but they didn't care. They had each other, and that was\nenough. They eloped to the mythical land of\nAmerica, and had many adventures, including\njamming with Nirvana, but eventually grew\nhome-sick. So Auntie Beeb waved her magic\ncommissioning rod and gave them a series on\nBBC2, with royalties, spin-offs and maybe\neven a spot on the Danny Baker Show.\nThe double bass is 'Bassie'; the man's name is Tavare. As in the late Jim Tavare. As\nin: Jim 'how much later can he be for this\nbloody interview?' Tavare. When I finally\ntrack him down, he gives me a cheery \"hello\nmate, where y 'been?\", which I interpret as an\napology (like I have a choice, right?).\nWe're off and running. Jim wants to talk\nabout his TV show:'Jim Tavare's Picture\nPostcards' (on BBC2 this January, kiddies).\nSo is this another 'alternative comedian\nmakes it big, re-hashes his stand-up act for\nTV thing? Perish the thought. Jim's written\nnew material especially for TV, and the\nprogrammes - 10 minute shorts shot on film,\nand almost completely without words - will be\nvery different from most comedy on the box.\nSounds interesting...\nWhen Jim and Bassie grace the Union's Ents Lounge on the 9th, expect a more\ntraditional night's comedy. (Well, as\ntraditional as a comic in full classical\nmusician's gear and carrying a double-bass\ncan get). Why a double-bass? Simple really:\nTavare used to be the bass-player in a rock\na billy band, and when he got into comedy, he\nused the bass as a prop - it's since become his\ntrademark. Unfortunately, the original 'Bassie'\nis long gone, while a recent incarnation was\nstolen after a gig at Derby. Posters appeared\nall over town ('Have You Seen This DoubleBass?') and thankfully, the culprit was caught.\nTavare has been asked to attend an identity\nparade of musical instruments to see if he can\nrecognise his 'Bassie'.\nBut you shouldn't have too much\ntrouble recognising Jim next Friday. He'll be\nthe one making you laugh, gj g Pint glasses from 50pT Shirts from \u00a31\nLong- sleeved T Shirts \u00a35\nRag Mags 50p Find out what all the fuss is about!\nIn the JCR 12-2pm Tuesday 6th, Thursday 8th& Friday 9th December\nFELIX\n\n"

The program\ngained him the highest level of access to the\nuniversity computer within minutes and,\nearned itself the notoriety of being the w^ original computer virus.\nSince then, viruses have swept the Wired\nworld like a plague. In 1986 two software\nsalesmen wrote the data-destroying Brain\nvirus, believed to have infected over 100,000\nmachines. In 1988 a21 year-old student\nreleased a self-replicating program onto the\nInternet. As it copied itself wildly, it shut\ndown thousands of machines and sent the j network thrashing. The program passed into\nhacker folklore as The Internet Worm.\nFred Cohen believed that the program he\nwrote was alive. Stephen Hawking, along with\nmany H \u00b0Llfe scientists, agrees that\ncomputer viruses fulfil all the criteria of\nbiological life.\nsimple rules give rise to complex, lifelike\nbehaviour.\nThe phenomenon of useful un programmed actions arising from a small set of programmed\nrules is known as emergent behaviour.[\nRodney Brooks, Genghis' creator, is\nconvinced that there are no for see able obstacles to the development of robots of human\nlevel intelligence through the action of\nemergent behaviour. ^^____^^j~^ J^^e< ti\nmm mmm mm mB^ mmm' mm mgm m \u00bbm>: \u2022\n\u2022 - sift:\nI \u2022 L.,H ML\nui jus mu it c if fl lire approach is that by simulating ct^\nand understanding complete animal-like systems at a simple level, we can T^n^ huil d up gradually to the human...We hope to reach human intelligence from I below instead of piecemeal through high-level competences as in Standard Al\"\nStewart Wifson/: art/ft cia? creature] creator speaking on how fl Hlf e's bottom-.\nup approach challenges traditional top-down Artificial /-'\n7\u00a3\nGenghis'\nprogeny have been pro\n[posed as an alternative to traditional monolithic j[ machines for use in space: in construction work on[\n[the moon and terraforming Mars.\nI And the military applications of a robot like j^ Genghis have not escaped notice by the US defence j[ department, which funds much fl \u00b0Llferesearch.
