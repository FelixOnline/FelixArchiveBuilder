Their previous inept\nperformances had failed to produce any\ngoals!\nThe game started with IC playing\nwith the wind and the team found\nthemselves in the unaccustomed\nposition of attacking the opposing\nteam. The prize first goal came\nafter only a few minutes when J. Shuttleworth headed on a long free\nkick for S. Marten to score. It wasn't long before J. Shuttleworth scored\nthe second and the third goal followed\nwhen S. Marten split the opposing\ndefence with a pass for J. Rowley to\nscore. It was then just a question\nof how many IC would score before\nhalf time. However due to their usual\nstandard of finishing only one more was scored when J. Shuttleworth scored\nfrom a through ball by S. Sims.\nThe second half was a much closer\nfought battle and produced the best\ngoal of the game when J. Rowley\nrose beautifully to P.O' Kelly's cross to head the ball into the top\ncorner of the net. The IC defence held\nfirm throughout the game and only\nsuffered one anxious moment when\ngoalkeeper S. Veats challenged the\nopposition's five foot striker and\nwon the ball convincingly, at the\nexpense of a lost tooth.\nThe sixth and final goal came following a good run by K. Reeve. He sent\nover a swirling cross which confused\nP.O 'Kelly so much that he was unable\nto get out of the way and the ball flew into\nthe net off his head.\nTeam: S. Veats, P. Walker, P. Lakin\n(Capt), K. Reeve, B. Caffin, S. Sims,\nS. Marten, D. Brannan, J. Shuttleworth,\nJ. Rowley, P.O 'Kelley.\n\"Piscatorial\nSociety\n\"What on earth is Piscatorial Society?\" This is the question most of you\nwho read the title of this article will ask yourself. In the Concise Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, \" piscatorial\" is\ndefined as\" addicted to fishing\", and\nthat is exactly for whom this club is intended. If you are the type of person\nwho would enjoy their Sundays as a day\non a river bank somewhere in the middle\nof nowhere, or perhaps on a beach, or\nin a boat, then this is the club for you.\nPiscatorial Society does exist, and\nwill provide subsidy for travel for\nmembers, and help with affiliation to\nfishing clubs. However, at the moment,\nit lacks any interest in its running,\nindeed, it has no members whatsoever.\nIt seems hard to believe that within\nImperial College there are no people who\nhave sufficient interest to help in the\nrunning of this club. So, if you think\nthat you would like to take an active\ninterest in this club please contact,\nMalcolm Clarke, Elec Eng 3, or Keogh Hall\n164, int 3636.\nRCS\nWelcome to 1979 and here are a few\ndates for your diary.\nMonday 8th to Monday 15th Papers for HJ T up.

PH0T0S0C\nImperial College Photographic Society\nare preparing a slide show for the Rector\nto give at the I.C. Open Day in the summer.\nTo this end a competition is being held. Entries are invited, from anyone - we are\nlooking for 35mm colour slides( or others\nin a2\" x2\" mount) on any subject related\nto Imperial College buildings, lectures(f),Rag, sport, Union Meetings, Concerts, club activities, or anything else that you can\nthink of. Slides don't need to have been\ntaken in197879 any year may be of\ninterest.\nThere is a prize of \u00a310 for the best\nslide (the judge will be announced later),\n& the closing date is Tuesday 27th February 1979. Entries can be handed in\nat the I.C.P hot soc Shop (see '\"What'sOn\" for times and places), or at any\nsociety meeting. Alternatively, if you\ndare risk sending slides through the\ninternal mail, they can be sent to Tim Ellison via the Chem Eng2 letter rack.\nAll slides should be individually marked\nwith the name and dept of the owner and\npreferably some description of the subject.\nIt is planned that the slide show will be\nkept permanently by college for members\nof staff to take to schools etc. Because of this, it is a condition of entry that college\nwill be allowed to keep the slides used in\nthe show. However, entrants will be given\ncopies of any of their slides so used (they\nshould be as good as the originals). AH slides not used in the show will be returned\nto their owners.

Whilst I accept this as a most stylish seasonal method of\ndisposal of plastic cups, I regret\nthat the Committee cannot recommend the award of the Aldous\nHuxley Memorial Scholarship\nsince, to constitute a valid entry\nthis session, the integer number\n(greater than one) of cups used\nmust be BOTH(1) a perfect number, i.e.a number equal to the sum of its\ndivisors, including one, but\nexcluding the number itself. For example the first two perfect\nnumbers are 6 and 28.\nAND(2) an odd number, i.e. not\ndivisible by 2.\nSuch valid entries will receive the\nconsideration of the Committee,\nbut all other plastic cups and\nwaste should, of course, be\nplaced as usual in the receptacles provided for this purpose.\nYours faithfully,\nDr. F.H. Berkshire\nSenior Tutor, Mathematics.\nDear Sir, - In my original letter\nthere was, of course, no intention of implying that Prof.Garton\nor Sir Hugh Ford were present\nmembers of ASTM S. Instead the\nintention was to offer proof that a student section of the College Branch of A.S c W./A.S. T.M.S. had existed over a long period.\nBriefly; from its formation in1918 until the 19 3 0 ' s the\nA.S! c.W. membership was exclusively graduates or\nequivalent. Then in the late\n1930's student membership\nbecame possible, whilst only in\nthe 1940's did technical staff\nbecome entitled to join. Later developments from 1968, with\nthe formation of A.S.T.M. S., have made possible other\nsections of membership.\nThe activities of the\nStudent Section of I.C. Branch\nof A.S c. W./A.S. T.M.S. have\nmainly been traditional and\noften clearly separate from the\nmainstream activities of the\nother groups forming the Branch.( One notable exception of this\nwas the mass joining by Chemistiy\nUndergraduates in the 1960's when they elected their representatives with the intention\nof negotiating with their Head of Department on various student\nThe Hum Dram we can beat It\nWe got where we are by thinking differently.\nBy being individuals. By employing people who can\nbend their minds away from the straight and narrow.\nThe unusual problem is just grist to our mill.\nThe unusual answer is a natural phenomenon.\nThe usual genius is what we'd like.\nThe unusually intelligent is what we'll settle for!\nIf you want to be in industry, but stay\nyourself, try Unilever.\nLook us up at your Appointments Service and find\nout when our visits take place, or write to:\nDr. D.H. Jones, U.K. National Personnel Dept.,\nUnilever Limited, Kildare House, London, EC4 P4D Y.U matters !)\nMy impression is that the\nactivities of the student section\nin the late 1930's were well received; since , for example, a suggestion that the then Rector\nbe approached to join seems to\nhave resulted in Sir Henry Tizard\nbeing listed in 1938 as a member\nof the Branch. Also claimed as\nmembers at that time are 3 College\nProfessors and no less than 4\nresearch assistants in 'Heat\nTransmission, City& Guilds', including a 'Hugh Ford' with a private address. Naturally if that is in error it will be noted.\nRegarding Prof. Garton, the\nMinutes of a General Meeting\nheld at5.15 p.m. on May 29th.,1936, in the Small Physics Theatre, list a' W.R. S Garton' as\nbeing elected 'Secretary' of\nthe Student Section.\nMay I explain why at this\npoint in time the archival material in my possession is being\nexamined. It is simply because\n1978 is the 60th year of the\nCollege Branch and we are\nhoping to celebrate this fact in\nthe new year. I hope to contact\nany individual who was a member\nat any time before 1948 with the\npossibility of inviting some of\nthem to come as guests. Further\nsince there is a proposition to\nwrite a definitive history of\nthe College Branch then relevant information about the\nearly parts of its history is being s aught now before\nmemories fade.\nFinally it is hoped to do\nsomething to restart a student\nsection of the College Branch in the Spring Term with a number of open meetings\nand some other activity.\nYours sincerely,\nHarry Fairbrother,\nPresident I CAST MAS ACDG\nrequire male or\nfemale models\nfor their Spring\npublicity.\nContact our\nadvertising\nmanager: Colin\nPalmer CCD2.\n\n"

A total\nsum of \u00a350,000 from the College's Central\nEquipment Fund was made available\nto the Refectory Committee over the next\ntwo years to finance the replacement of\nmajor items of equipment.\nRefectory prices are reviewed termly and\nthe next review will be in March. The use\nof the regulator, linking prices to inflation,\nis to continue.\nO/S Fee Increases on the Way Contrary to reports recently in the press, the government has not shelved its\ncontroversial plans on overseas students.\nThis was made clear by Shirley Williams, Secretary of State for Education and\nScience, when she spoke to the annual\nconference of the World University Service\njust before Christmas. She told delegates,\nincluding those from Imperial, that at\npresent overseas students were being\nsub sidi sed on their tuition fees to the tune\nof well over \u00a3100 million a year, and that\nthis subsidy was quite indiscriminate and\napplied equally to the poor and the rich. She suggested that this \u00a3100 m should be\nused \" positively\" to help \" selected groups\" of overseas students, mainly\nstudents from developing countries on\ncourses said to benefit those countries.\nThis would inevitably lead to large\nincreases in fees for large numbers of\nself-supporting overseas students not\nespecially\" selected\", who would probably be charged the full \" economic cost\" of their courses, which Mrs. Williams est i mated to be \u00a32,450 for a university undergraduate in1977, and \u00a31,140 for a student\nin non-advanced further education.\nMary Attenborough challenged several of\nthe points raised by Mrs. Williams, and\nexplained that it was not realistic to\ndivide the total cost of an institution by\nthe number of students, and so arrive\nat a cost per student, and therefore\ndisputed the \" subsidy\" figure of \u00a3100m. She claimed that education should be.\nprovided on need and academic merit,\nnot on ability to pay, and argued for the\nending of discrimination in fee levels.\nMaiy went on to attack Mrs. Williams\nover the recent change in the definition\nof \"ordinary residence\" as aqua li fic ation for receiving an LEA grant, which\nshe regarded as callous. This point was\nechoed by Fiona Mctaggart, NUS Vice President (Education).\nMrs. Williams' s speech and subsequent\nreplies to questions were greeted with\ndismay and sce pt is m by an unsympathetic\naudience of those dedicated to improving\nthe educational opportunities available\nto those from third world countries.\nA full report of the WUS(UK) Conference\nwill appear in a later FELIX.

January ff t lli1.00 pm.( CONTIKI)\nAn altogether different experience.\nIf you're 18-30 and want to see Europe in '79, why not\ntravel on a Contiki tour, where you can find yourself staying in\na13 th century villa in Florence , a chateau set amongst\nvineyards in France, a fortress on the Rhine or a tavern a on\nMykonos?\nThese unique stopovers are in line with Contiki' s slogan:\n\" Not just a tour but an altogether different experience.\" Contiki Travel was founded 18 years ago and now claims\nto be Britain' s biggest tour operator for the under 35 age\ngroup. As well as the Special Stopovers already mentioned\nthe new Contiki concept for 1979 features camping tour\naccommodation in permanent \" canvas villages\" framed tents\nset up in more than 12 major European cities, such as\nParis, Vienna, Barcelona, Venice, Munich, Rome, Copenhagen,\nOslo, Stockholm and Berlin. On some nights there are even bungalows and cabins. In\nCorfu there ate straw huts. Contiki campers have one unusual\nstopover in Holland: it is at the Groot Hu is at Noordgouwe, about\n50 kilometres south of Rotterdam in the Dutch countryside.\nThe Florentine villa stopover residence, the Torre dl Gattaia\nwas once owned by the Pitti family and has an olive grove and\nswimming pool. The 15th century Chateau D'Ag nac, built for a king of\nLanguedoc, is a short drive from the Mediterranean.\nContiki coaches carry a courier, driver and \" super cook\". Each passenger contributes to a food kitty which covers the\ncost of three meals a day (except for occasional eating out\nto sample local dishes). An example from the range of Contiki tours from London\nin 1979 is a\" Central European\" six weeks and 13 countries.\nThe price includes touring, city sightseeing, excursions, a seat at a Spanish bullfight, a canal cruise in Venice, a visit to the salt mines at Berchtesgaden, a boat cruise on the Rhine, tour of Amsterdam canals, and four days on the Greek island of Corfu, with water skiing included too!\nThe Contiki1979 brochure also has details of hotel tours\nin Europe, overland journeys between Kathmandu and London, ski tours in Austria and hotel accommodation in London as well as a range of other facilities at Contiki' s office in the West End. Incidentally, 2 out of 5 Contiki passengers are travelling\nalone but obviously in a group of young people you soon make '\nfriends.\nSo if you fancy a taste of living like a lord, French, Italian\nor Gernian style, go Contiki in '79 - it's ah altogether different\nexperience!\n\n"

Dr. Malcolm Coe, leader of numerous expeditions to arid regions, (arranged by\nIC Exploration Board).\nLPS AND THE RENT ACT\nLondon Property Services of Hamlet Gardens fame, have long\nbeen notorious for their blatant evasion of the Rent Acts by\ngiving their tenants a so-called licence which purports to deprive\nthem of their status as protected tenants.\nIt operates on the basis of a non-exclusive possession clause. Exclusive possession means that the tenants have a right to\nenjoy the accommodation that they occupy to the exclusion of everybody else (including control over access by the\nlandlord and his agents). If a group of people take on a place\nbetween them, all signing the same agreement at the same time,\nthen they are usually joint tenants who, although they don't have exclusive possession as against each other, do have exclusive possession as a group.\nThe L.P.S. agreement tries to get round this by giving\nseparate agreements to each tenant and reserving the right for\nthe landlord to replace any occ u pier with someone else as and when\nhe chooses. This breaks up the Joint tenant unit (if it is accepted\nas being valid) and so appears to get round the Rent Acts. Two recent Court of Appeal decisions upheld agreements of this\nsort as achieving their expressed intentions and it had begun\nto look as though this was going to become an established\nloophole.\nThe most recent case, however, this time specifically on\nan L.P.S. agreement was decided by the Court of Appeal in\nfavour of the tenants, thus giving them full Rent Act protection\nand bringing them within the jurisdiction of the Rent Officer.\nTheoretically, this means that all L.P.S. tenants (except those\nin the college flats) can now apply to the Rent Officer for a substantial rent reduction. The only snag, however, is that\nthe Court of Appeal case was decided not just on the basis of\nthe agreement but also on the attendant circumstances. So\none can't say for sure that all L.P.S. tenants would be viewed\nby the courts in the same way. The report of the case has not\nyet found its way into print so it is difficult to tell whether or\nnot the circumstances in that case were substantially different\nfrom the usual L.P.S. set up. Nevertheless, because LJP.S. follow a uniform letting procedure, it seems likely that other\nL.P.S. tenants should be helped by this latest decision. If\nnothing else, it does indicate that the wind of change may be\nblowing through the Court of Appeal which is good news for\nall licence es. Because the position with regard to L.P.S. is not cut and\ndried it is likely that you will find Rent Officers reluctant\nto register a fair rent as they don't like getting involved in\nanything which is at all contentious. Despite this, if any of\nyou L.P.S. tenants feel like having a go at getting a fair rent,\nperhaps you would like to come up to the Welfare Centre\n(third floor Union Building) for a chat about it.\nMichael Arthur\nWelfare Adviser\n\n"

Take petrol rationing for example.\nAs I write I have just returned from aV/2 hour wait in sub-zero temperatures at my local petrol station for a4 gallons\nper customer petrol ration, and I am wondering whether next\nweek there will be any petrol at all. So desperate are some people\nthat, on hearing that the cash register had jammed and the garage\nwas now unable to give customers any change, a young teacher\nin the queue told me that she didn't care what it cost her so\nlong as she could fill her tank.\nSoon she may no longer need to worry about getting to work.\nIn some parts of the country schools are already closed because\nthere is no fuel to heat the classrooms. IC also depends on oil deliveries to keep its large draught y buildings heated and the\nfirst area to suffer will be the lecture theatres.\nIf lecture s are cancelled we can all spend more time in the\nlabs. Well perhaps - or perhaps not, because the technicians\nare still operating a work to rule and some equipment cannot be\nused. There is no sign of a speedy end to that dispute so it\nlooks like you will have extra spare time on your hands.\nA good thing too for those who do their own shopping\nbecause soon it may not be so easy to buy food. Having survived the bread shortage we are now faced with the possibility of shortages of everything and anything. Fresh vegetables were\nthe first to go, when those which were not frozen into the ground\nwere unable to leave the farms after the worst snow-fall for 15\nyears. Housewives immediately turned to frozen vegetables\n(several packs have suddenly appeared in my mother's freezer)\nand cleared the freezer centres faster than restocking could take\nplace. Now, with the beginning of the lorry drivers' dispute, all food supplies are threatened and supermarket shelves are speedily\nemptied as people stock up as if for a long siege.\nMilk deliveries may not last long. I am thawing out a pint of\nmilk which has just been delivered frozen solid in its bottle.\nThat it is there at all I believe I ha\\e to thank the Guinness brewery,\nwho made their tankers available to the Milk Marketing Board to\ntransport milk from the farms. Unfortunately they do not seem to\nhave mixed up the two liquids and I looked in vain for a brown\nfrothy beverage on my doorstep.\nI am surprised that there have not been any power cuts so far\nthis winter, except of course for those caused by the snow bringing\ndown the supply lines s Some years ago we used to suffer voltage\nreductions and cuts whenever the weather turned slightly colder\nthan usual r When the whole of France woke up one morning without\nelectricity, I expected warnings of the imminent occurrence of the\nBritish version, but we have until now (keep your fingers crossed)\nbeen spared this affliction. Before readers become too complacent,\nhowever, do I not recall that the electricity supply workers\nare due for another round of pay talks shortly?\nSo as Is it by the gas fire in the candle light, unable to leave\nhome except on foot as there is no petrol for the cars and buses\nand the trains cannot run because it is. too cold, and I wonder\nwhere the next meal is coming from, while attempting to think\nof some good reasons to persuade the Editor that FELIX really\ndoes need a foreign correspondent, preferably in a warm strike-free country, I' try to find something cheerful to say to welcome\nyou back for another term. At least FELIX is still being printed,\nfor with \" The Times\" suspended and the provincial journalists\non strike, there may soon be few newspapers left to tell you\nabout the next round of disruptions to normal life.

The device, which\ncosts over \u00a38000 including VAT, will replace\nthe purely mechanical var it y per used at\nthe moment.\nThe phototypesetter sets copy into columns electronically and prints using an optical system onto photographic paper. It has\nthe advantages that it is simple to use, it\nproduces justified text automatically and\nthe size of type can be varied from 5Vi to 36\npoint from the keyboard.\nProduction of FELIX will be made easier\nas a result because the finished text will be\navailable earlier, thus allowing more time\nfor pasting up. In addition, the Handbook,\nAlternative Prospectus and Phoenix will also be set by the Union with a subsequent\nimprovement in their quality and flexibility of production.\nThe typesetter is being paid for partly by\nCollege, whose contribution is \u00a34259, with\nthe remainder coming from the Union over\nseveral years. The Union down payment this\nyear is \u00a32000.\nSIR BRIAN RECEIVES PEERAGE Sir Brian Flowers, Rector of Imperial\nCollege, became a life peer in the New\nYear Honours.\nThe Rector is one of six new life peers.\nThe others are Hugh Scanlon, leader of\nthe Engineering Workers Union from 1968-78, Sir Bernard Miles, founder of the\nMermaid Theatre, Sir Walter Pern-, Vice Chancellor of the Open Ui ivers it y, Sir\nJohn Richardson, President of the General\nMedical Council and Admiral Sir Peter\nHill Norton. Sir Brian returns from India this week\nand has not yet announced how he is to\nbe addressed in the future. He received\nhis Knighthood in 1969 and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1961.\nAmong his many honours, he received\nthe title of Chevalier de la Legion\nd 'Honneur in 1974. This French title\nwas originated by Napoleon. In the 17th century the French title' Chevalier' was equivalent to the English Knight.\nASTMS BACK\nThe Imperial College branch of ASTM S ended their industrial action at midday\nyesterday, Thursday 11th January. At a branch meeting, representatives of the\nUnion who had been negotiating with the\nCollege stated that they had obtained a satisfactory solution. Action by the\nmembers of ASTM S therefore came to an end\nA settlement was nearly reached earlier\nin the week when an agreement over the\nholidays was arrived at, but unfortunately\nthe matter of Pam Martins' reinstatement\nremained unsolved. At 12:20pm yesterday,\nin a meeting between representatives of the\nUnion, College Personnel Section and the\nMetallurgy and Materials Science Department, ASTM S officials presented a statement on the Pam Martins ' issue which was\nsigned by Dr. Lloyd Thomas on behalf of\nthe department. This was then reported to\nthe branch meeting at 1:15pm. As a result of the agreement, ASTM S members will receive an extra five days\nholiday per year with three extra days\ncarried over into 1979 from 1978.\n\n"

Which leads me to\nElection Fever\nThis is the term when IC becomes strewn with posters saying\n\"Vote For Me Because \" and \"Best Man for the Job\" etc.\nYes, election time will soon be on us with the buying of large\nrounds in the bar, the inevitable hunt for second ers and all that\nit entails.

Toggle, AC, DC, Bar\nBASED ON A WELL KNOWN CARBON FILM Reg Voltage looked across at his wife Zener and wondered\nif there was any chance left for him to transformer. Their\nshelf life was so full of high tension these days and neither\nhad the capacity any more to maintain a bistable state.\nSuddenly there was a centre tap on the window and when\nReg looked out he saw along tailed pair of eyes belonging\nto Ivor Gauss, his wife's ex-lover. In Gauss' hand was an\nelectron gun and as Reg watched he inserted a cartridge, took\nshu re aim and pulled the trigger. The single shot reverberated\nand Reg dropped rapidly to the deck, his life cut dead short\nat its most positive peak.\nIvor leaped in just as Zener grabbed the ph ono to dil the\nbinary code and call the fuzz. He quickly took hold of her\nand taped her loudspeaker to avoid any audio-breakthrough\nand, having established a low noise state, he stopped to ponder.\nHe had to rectify the situation in some way and smooth things\nover; he was afraid that the din would have upset the next-door neighbour L.C. Bridge and lead to interference.\nHe listened - no noise, not even hums or rumbles - all was\nwell. Walking to the nearby cabinet he removed a bottle,\nfilled the mixer and oscillated it vigorously as if his life\ndepended on i t.He poured out the potential juice through a filter, added a small current and watt he could in the time base available. Then he decided to visit his transistor and brother\nacross the channel while allowing things to coulomb off and\nso executed a quick thermal runaway.\nZener by this time had broken the tape and, although very\nshocked, knew she had to contact her friend Meg Ohm and\ntell her all that had happened. Ivor, she realised, was\nterribly unstable and had to be caught and de fluxed before\nhe caused any more gunn effects. She picked up the ph ono and di led Meg; she heard the decibel ringing but it seemed a decade before it was answered and she could discharge her\nload to Meg, who immediately said,' I.C.' and being very\nlogical insisted on calling the fuzz on the 625 line.\nFeeling all wire wound up Zener eased her tension by\nhaving a smoke of pot but nanoseconds later the law arrived\nat the voltage threshold to collector. Meg was with them\nand they all shifted into the force vehicle which was a fast\nfour pole motor; with the driver using full choke they sped away\ndown the bypass to try and short circuit the kilo volt Ivor.\nWhile driving along Detector Schmitt asked Zener to ver of yall the facts and to be as unbiased as possible so he could\nrelay the data to other units and switch the entire force output\non to the problem.\nReports quickly avalanche d in as to Ivor Gauss' position -He had been detected near a gate into a field effect by the\nAFC shore and it was not long before the motor reached\nthe spot and they could all see Ivor running away very fast.\nDespite a loose bootstrap he ran on until he reached a uni junction where he was momentarily quiescent before dashing\noff down a low resistance path that led to the Darlington Pair. When he got to the end, he stopped and just stood, caught\nin the modulated light beam of the motor's lamps. The atmospheric s were electrolytic and pulses quickened as Detector\nSchmitt ordered him to drop his electron gun and have the\nsensitivity to respond to higher power levels, but instead Gauss just made bipolar digital signals and gave a saw toothy grin. He had obviously realised that push or pull he had no means of\nescape, and as they watched him it was suddenly very\napparent that he was going to commit sinus oid; before anyone\ncould be galvani sed into action he gave a half wave and emitting\nan over modulated screech come howl jumped straight off\nDarlington Pair into the waves of the A.F.C. The effect of all this high frequency drama on Zener was\nthat she broke down but Schmitt quickly took control and\nassured her that the reaction was quite normal, and that all had worked out for the best. This brought her down to earth\nbefore long and Schmitt asked if she and Meg would dyne with\nhim at the ' Auxiliary In' the next day so they could engage\nin some cross talk about other things less harmful to the\nmemory systems. The reply was positive and that very day\na firm friendship was fused that was to produce a phase change\nin all their lives by degrees, and Zener could see that despite\nrecent flux in events, she would solder on regardless.\nThe Very End\n\n"

    "content": "Page 8\nNew Year\nMutterings\nI hope you all had a very happy holiday and are now looking\nforward to studying hard this term.\nI'd like to congratulate the Rector on obtaining a Life Peerage\nwhich was announced in the New Year's Honours List. I would\nalso like to congratulate all those others from Imperial mentioned\nin the New Year'S Honours List whose names are too numerous\nfor me to remember.\nIn my last article at the end of last term I mentioned that\nShirley Williams would be making a major announcement on the\nsubject of overseas students at the World University Service\nConference held in late December. The announcement made was\nnot particularly mind shattering. She continued the line that\n\" the full economic cost\" of overseas students was in the region\nof \u00a32.000 each and thai therefore there was a hidden subsidy\ngiven'by the Government in the region of \u00a3100 million to overseas\nstudents. She felt that this amount could be better used sub sid ising those overseas students, in particular economic need, e.g. from underdeveloped countries. The implication, however, was that\nfor the average overseas student, the future long-term review may\nwell mean that they will end up paying \" the full economic cost\" in fees.\nThere is some consolation, however, that next year there will only be inflation increases in tuition fee levels. As the policy\nof Imperial College Union is to oppose any increases in fee levels\nwe will, of course, be arguing against Governing Body accepting\nany increase in tuition fees at their meeting at the end of this\nterm, it will also be an opportune time to again oppose the\ndiscriminatory fee levels charged to overseas students.\nRefectories\nThe Governing Body meeting held on the last day of last\nterm decided against the Refectory Committee's recommendation\nof a2% round the board increase on refectory prices. This was of\ncourse after considerable opposition from Imperial College Union. This seems to make unnecessary our boycott of the refectories\nwhich was to take place early in the Spring term. It will be up to\nthe Union meeting held on the 23rd January as to whether they wish\nto continue with the boycott or not. There remains the problem of the\nincrease in refectory prices which came about at the beginning of\nDecember of 1.9% due to the Financial Times index increase by\nthat amount. This increase comes about as a result of the \" regulator\" which aims to make sure price increases on food stuffs are\nkept up-to-date within the refectories. However, the student\nrepresentatives on the Refectory Committee realised that as the\ncost of food only accounts for half the total cost of refectory meals\nthe increase should in fact have been only 0.95% in order to account\nfor food price increases. We will therefore be raising this discrepancy in the future as well as continuing the campaign to ensure that\nthe quality of the food is improved.\nOrdinary Residence\nThere is a light on the horizon for those students who have been\nrefused grants due to the new definition of \"ordinary residence\" used by the authorities. Michael Arthur, the Union Welfare Adviser, has prepared a legal paper on the definition which has now had the\nsupport of Counsel's opinion. The Union will now be looking towards\nencouraging individuals to take some local education authorities\nto court over their refusal to give grants. If this action is unsuccessful, however, the College is likely to take a sympathetic view of\nthe problems of these students who are suddenly faced with the\nnecessity to pay their own fees as well as find their own maintenance for three years. It seems likely that the College will set up\na Hardship fund to deal with this very special case. U. G.M. Next U GM will be on Tuesday, 23rd January, at 1.00 in the Great\nHall, where amongst other exciting items on the agenda, will be\nthe election of a Chairperson for Union meetings.\nNew Year Resolutions\nMy major New Year resolutions are firstly, to finish writing\nFELIX articles in excess of three-quarters of an hour before\nthe copy deadline, and not to drink excessively more than\ntwice a week. I don't hold out much chance of success in\neither case!\nMary Attenborough\nPresident I.C.U. IC ENTS PRESENT\nA&M ROAD SHOW\nwith\nTHE SECRET SHRINK\nNICKY SHY\nplus Disco\nat 8:00pm only 50p Union Concert Hall RECLAIM THE NIGHT!\nAt the NUS National Conference (Dec 78), a motion was\noverwhelmingly passed, entitled \" Sexual Violence, Rape, and\nReclaim the Night\", and this called for a national \" Reclaim the Night\" demonstration in London, which is due to be held\nnext Saturday, 20th January, at 6.30pm in Leicester Square.\nThe aim of aRe claim the Night demonstration is to show\nthat women can walk alone at night without the protection of\nmen, and thus such a demonstration is for women only. As the\nwhole point of the demonstration is centred around a woman's right to walk alone, men being present would negate its reasons\nand effect.\nIt is part of the NUS campaign for Women's Safety, and I would\nurge all women from IC to attend.\nAt Universities, polytechnics and colleges throughout the\ncountry, a mass movement has grown up to eliminate sexism from\nentertainments, as part of an overall awareness that sexism tends\nto prevent women from playing a full and equal role in society.\nIt is, of course, quite natural that such a movement should\noriginate and quickly spread among such educational establishments,\nwhose occupants are perhaps best able to recognise sexism for the\ngreat social evil that it is. It is gratifying that young intelligent\npeople are willing to think beyond traditions and habits, and try\nto change society for the better.\nHowever, regret t fully, there is still one bastion of male morons\nwho regard tradition as sacred, and still stubbornly refuse to open\ntheir eyes to the harsh reality of life as it really is - because\nthey're not the ones who suffer. Perhaps one day, IC Union will reach out for its much needed social conscience. Meanwhile, as\nExternal Affairs Officer, it is very difficult to explain to\ncolleagues elsewhere exactly why Imperial College has just\nabout the most disgustingly sexist Students Union in the\ncountry - and is proud of it.
