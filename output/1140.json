    "content": "22 Books/Arts 15 March 1999\nSHADOW DANCER\nby Tom Bradby\nlUI VI lii\"\nIdon't read many airport thrillers. I hadn't read one for quite sometime when I was offered the chance to review this one, and now I remember why they are unsatisfying. This genre is great for avoiding eye contact with\nother passengers on long tube jour-ney s, but to expect more than several\ndays of ridiculous violence and gratuitous sex is optimistic. Character development and natural plot progression go out of the window, make a dirty\nmess on the pavement and disappear\nout of sight down the gutter to make way for shocks and sensationalism. One constantly feels like one is reading an adaptation of a very poor Channel Five\nTV movie, want on nudity and all.\nCharacters are thinned down to easily recognised stereotypes so the writer\ndoesn't have to bother describing them fully. These protagonists have hunk y names like 'Jack Ryan' or 'Bruce Wayne'.\nThey are put in an 'exciting' situation. A chain Of events inevitably leads to some spectacular end-piece where the forces\nof righteousness overcome the evil-doers by a hair's breadth - not the kind\nof plot lines discussed on The Late\nShow. Action is king, art is nothing. Oh yes, the book. It lives up to all\nthe above, but has some redeeming features. Colette Is the attractive sister\nof Gerry McVeigh, leader of the IRA\nBelfast brigade and total n utter. Her other brother, imaginatively named Paddy, is also a high ranking Republican.\nThey hang around with a crowd of Sean s, Kierans, Murphy s and other stereotypical Irish types planting bombs and kneecapping shopkeepers. Unlucky\nColette gets caught one day trying to bomb Waterloo station and becomes a 'tout' in return for not being jailed. Her\nMI5 controller, the hunk y David Ryan\n(no relation of Tom Clancy's Jack) falls\nfor her and she falls for him. They foil\na series of plots as the book draws to its ridiculous denouement. Bradby deserves credit for his easy\nreading style. He is clear and informative, as befits his job, ITN Northern Irela nd correspondent. His journalistic pedigree also shows in his ability to give a sense of context. The action takes place in London and Belfast. He clearly owns an A to I of both cities,\njudging by the way that he describes\nevery detail of even the most trivial\nwanderings of his characters. He captures the mood of the province well and highlights the incredible disparity\nbetween life in Ulster and life in England. The detail shows he has done good research - pity he hasn'td one so well when thinking up plots and char-act ers. The whole book has a sense of deja vu. All the policemen act like Tosh\nLyons from The Bill and all the terrorists\nare thuggish maniacs. The ubiquitous gripping emotional dilemma is 'will\nColette take responsibility for her two kids or die fighting for the cause?' To be honest, I didn't really mind either way,\nand as I read the last page before I started the book, I already knew the answer. The main problem with the narrative is that one can spot where the fiction ends and the facts begin. The street\nnames are real but the people walking along them are false. The methods of execution are genuine but the victims\nseem unreal. Still, one wouldn't want to\nbe disturbed by such superficial enter-tai ning tat.\nI have to admit that I did want to know what happened next at almost\nevery stage of the book. It had a grip-ping roller coaster plot, which had me engrossed. However, as soon as I fin-is he d the book I didn't feel in any way\nmoved by the tragedy. In fact, the book had no deeper effect on me than acquainting me with some street names\nin Belfast.\nlain\nPublished by Corgi, \u00a35.99\nNASH ENSEMBLE - FOCUS ON THE MUSIC OF\nHARRISON BIRTWISTLE\nPureed Room, South Bank Centre\nT he composer Harrison Birtwistle\ncame to major public attention with\nthe performance of his piece Panic,\nfor saxophone, drummer and orchestra,\nat the Last Night of the 1995 BBC Proms.\nAside from the inevitable outcry ( some people complained before they'd even heard the piece), this event established\nhim as a kind of British Patron Saint of Contemporary Music, a deserved position for a composer who has been a leading musical figure for over 30 years.\nThe Nash Ensemble's concert prog ram me opened with a performance of Birtwistle's1969 arrangements of motets\nby two medieval composers: Ockeghem' s Ut Heremita Solus and Hoquetus David by Guillaume de Machaut. The\ncombination of medieval melodic lines\nand modern orchestration was striking.\nThe clashes of instrumental colour and transposition of octave ranges created a quirky and original sound world, without\never obscuring the original musical mate-rial.\nThis was followed by Debussy's Trois\npoem es de Stephane Mallarme, settings\nof poems by the writer better known as\nthe inspiration behind the composer's Prelude de I 'Apres-midi d 'un faune. The\noriginal music( for voice and piano) was\narranged by composer Colin Matthews for an ensemble of two flutes, two clar-in ets, piano and string quartet - the same instrumentation used by Ravel.\nThe result, sung by soprano Claron\nMcFadden, was delightful.\nThe first half concluded with another\nBirtwistle piece from1969, his Cantata,\nincorporating fragments of Ancient Greek texts translated into English. The\nmusicians' parts comprise a number of options from which they pick-and-choose\nwhat to play at any given moment. The\nresult is a spontaneous and exciting atmosphere that is maintained through a musical landscape, ranging from the mysterious and delicate to the furious\nand overwhelming. Claron McFadden' s performance was once again astonish-ing.\nThe second half opened with The\nSoldier's Tale Suite - five extracts from Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale, arranged\nby the composer for violin, clarinet and piano (the original is for narrator, actors,\ndancer and seven musicians). It tells the\nstory of a soldier who makes a deal with\nthe devil, selling his violin for great riches\n- but he turns out to have sold his happiness with his violin. The piece received\na passionate performance by violinist\nLeo Phillips, clarinettist Richard Hosford\nand pianist Ian Brown. It was followed by\nBirtwistle's Duets for Storab, a set of s flute duets inspired by Scottish folk music\n(more in form than in style); the music\nproved interesting, but in the end, left\nme a little cold.\nThe concert finished with one of Birtwistle's most recent works, The\nWoman and the Hare for recite r, sopra n and ensemble. The libretto is by\nBirtwistle's friend, the poet David\nHarsent, who was asked by the com poser to provide a text that was \"both\ndelicate and yet violent\", for a woman's voice. The same description could be applied to the music, which is by turns\ngentle, intriguing, terrifying and ultimately quite chilling - a truly amazing aural experience, which only served to confirm something I 've believed ever\nsince seeing his opera Punch and Judy over the Summer,- that Harrison Birtwistle\nis quite simply one of the most brilliant\nand compelling composers writing today.\nJoe\n\n"

    "content": "10 Columns 15 March 1999\nClayponds' Village Hall\nG' lay ponds has, over the years,\nbeen good to me, Not because \u2022 I have lived there - I 've only visited a couple of times but rather for\nthe fact that it has given me many a col-um non account of its propensity to\nproduce bizarre statements and actions\nfrom College. Those of you who have been here longer than is healthy will\nrecall the spate of burglaries, caused in\npart by locks less secure than a choco late chastity belt, and the wholly unnecessary re carpeting exercise, which cost\na fortune and was opposed by almost all the residents. Now the long-run-ning saga of the Village Hall has re sur faced. It would seem that this is now a possibility, but only with an enormous condition a rent rise. This, as you might imagine, has gone down like a lead balloon, and raises a number of important issues.\nFirst and foremost, this would establish a precedent for accommodation improvements to be funded by\nincreases in rent. This could have very\ndamaging implications, particularly for\nthe South Ken estate, where consider able work is needed. If this move is\nallowed lo succeed, it would give the\nCollege the ability to block all expenditure on upgrades to hall social fac ili ties. It seems a fair\nbet that people in\nresidences such as\nGarden Hall would never stand for\nhigher rents given the current standards they are\n' enjoying.' Many would consider that\nthe College is failing\nto deliver the level\nof service that its res-idents( i.e. customers) could reasonably expect. Upping the not inconsiderable rent would simply add insult to injury. In this case, it may only be 90p per week, but what if it were to\nreach \u00a32, \u00a35, \u00a310 in other cases? Then there is the question of limiting the rise\nto Clay ponds. The College may claim that only the boys and girls in Faling will\nbenefit from the building, but is this\ntheir usual policy? Was the tv ely n Gard ens refurbishment funded entirely by\nits residents? I don't know, but since they are not each paying \u00a3500 per\nweek, I suspect not. Did Catering fund the entire cost of the JCR/QT redevelopment? No, the Union's income from the STA rent was slashed in order to\nmeet some of the cost. You could, at\na squeeze, justify the JCR bit of the pro-j ect, but their money has effectively\nbeen used to fund a rival catering out-Voice of Reason\n\"Given that Residences spend over\n\u00a318,000 annually on\nthe Clayponds' gar-dens, a few extra\nthousand for the village hall seems perfectly possible.\"\nlet, which is supposed to be an inde-pendent, self financing enterprise. Methinks that IC is being less than\nevenhanded in their dealings. If you assume the role of Devil's advocate to\naccept for a minute that\nresidents\nshould pay\nfor such improvements, it is\nsurely right\nthat the costs\nare borne College wide. As the\nhousing stock is\nupgraded, this would mean that\nmost people would eventually benefit\nfrom any rent increases, paying for other pe o ple's benefits one year, only to be the\nrecipient in subsequent years. Though seemingly practical, this is not without difficulty; if students\ngave the impression that they were prep a red to tolerate rent rises that were ring fenced for\nimprovements, I fear\nthat that trust would soon be abused, the\nprojects becoming more tenuously linked to the stated\naim. Then wc come to the cost. As our\ndear old friend Ian\nCaldwell suggests, it\nshould not cost more than \u00a375,000.\nMany residents think this is a tad high,\nwhich may be explained by a couple of\nfactors. It may be due to a slightly over-ambitious vision for the facility; as I have said before, Ian and his design team did a cracking job with the JCR.\nThis, on the other hand, probably requires a slightly\nmore spartan design. The cost may\nalso be due in part\nto the anticipated use of College Approved Cowboys, highly skilled in taking the public sector for a ride. Such problems tend to be\nmanifested more acutely in the small\nworks ra the t than BMS-size und cr tak Simon Baker\n\"...New Labour would\nnot allow their media\nimage to be sullied by\nsuch tawdry matters\nas economics...\"\nin gs. Price aside, it's not a king's ran-som,a mounting to roughly the Rector's accommodation, hospitality and car\nhire budget last year.\nMoreover, it\nwould not\nneed to be found in one year's budget. The money would be borrowed, requiring only\ninterest,\nrepayment and maintenance to be charge in any\none year.\nGiven that\nResidences spend over \u00a318,000\nannually on the Clayp on ds' gard ens, a few extra thousand for the village hall seems perfectly possible. In\nfact, if you plo nk ed the building on a flowerbed, you might break even...\nSeriously, this is, in the grand scheme of things,\na trivial matter. It\nhas tied up committees for ages, wasted the time of\nhighly salaried members of College staff, the total\ncost of which probably starts to\napproach the project cost. Seventyfive grand won't even buy you a flowerbed these days, and since the\nprovision of student social facilities sits at the core of the College's responsibilities, it is time that the damn thing was built and pe ople got on with more important issues,\nsuch as how the Ile ll is the enormous Beit Hall redevelopment going to pay\nfor itself, despite the\ndoubtlessly flawless\nprojections of its\nmain protagonist, the Conference Office, so ably led by\nthe ind ub ita bly pro-fess ional, but ever so\nslightly litigious Annette De Lima. If\nwe slip upon that\none, I shall be re donning the old hard\nhat to avoid the fallout.\nVI ti\n\"...it is time that the\ndamn thing was built\nand people got on with\nmore important issues,\nsuch as how the enormous Beit Hall redevelopment is going to pay\nfor itself...\"\nBudget and Beer\n\"he budget dust has settled and, despite outward appearances to\nthe contrary, Gordon Brown has\ndone a smash and grab raid, albeit\nwith unprecedented subtlety. As a homeowner with a penchant for the\nodd Marlboro Light, I feel decidedly miffed, but looking beyond the trauma inflicted on my own wallet, the initial\nfeeling that we were in for a bonanza has now completely subsided. The new10 p tax band sounds good in principle,\nbut is little more than a gimmick. More over it replaces the20 p rate on a band\nthat was twice as wide. The proposed cut off the basic rate next year, by\nwhich time many of you will be earn-ing, is to be welcomed. However, if\nBrown was serious about helping the\nlost paid workers, he would have increased allowances by a significant\npercentage, there by taking more pe ople out of the tax system altogether.\nThe problem is that this doesn't give\nsuch snappy headlines, and since New Labour would not allow their media image to be sullied by such tawdry\nmatters as economics, it had to bite the\ndust. The opportunity to reform the\nunacceptable Child Benefit system was\nnot taken, which is unfortunate. Such\na universal benefit,\nindeed any universal handout, is\nindefensible. It is\nhigh time that it\nshould be means tested or replaced\nwith a more suit-able payment. However, Gord on Brown deserves much praise for one of his actions, namely\nthe freezing of\nalcohol excise duty. In the best\ntraditions of Pebble Mill, that links\nnicely to my next subject. Southside\nBar, about which I have been un for giv ably quiet of late, is currently stag-ing the annual Hog's Breath Beer\nFestival, lor those of you who insist on confining yourselves to wish y was hy lager, now is the time to repent for\nyour sins. As always, the range is\nsuperb, though there are probably more of the unusual beers down there\nat the moment. If you want to try something very out of the ordinary, get yours elf a pint of Air over Tong ham, marvellous taste but a tad strong at\n9 % . The posters suggest half-pints only,\nbut you decide. I would mention how ever, that when Is upped said bitter, I left my laptop on a train at East Croyd on. Tread carefully, my children. "

What I didn't realise at the time was that the\nCollege Careers Service already has an extensive programme that deals with almost everything I had in mind, how refreshing.

The idea has\nbeen knocking around for a few years,\nbut never acted upon, now that the space is available though, there' s nothing in our way and we' ve already received \u00a32000 from the careers service\nevery year for the project. The idea is\nto provide a Union run facility where you can register and receive information on part lime/ temporary jobs through- '\nout London. Our current plan will\nallow you to register through the internet or the office and when a job comes in that fits your specifications you will be emailed about the details\nand various information will be disp laye d about the College.

Dress\ncode - none.\nLast Friday Joel, Stephen (my mate from\nthe IC IVs football team) and I met up to\nreview what we thought would just be\nan ordinary night of clubbing at the\nHanover Grand. Naturally, we had to\nhave a few drinks before the club and\ndecided to try the 'lovely' bars of Soho.\nThis was a bad move as we had to keep\nrestraining Joel from entering various\n'establishments' - after all we had to\nreview a club and he could always come\nback later. . So on to the club.\nThe theme of the night in the Hanover\nwas 'High Noon' and it was no surprise\nthat many of the people in there were\ndressed in various cowboy outfits. The\nclub itself was quite packed, many from\nIC - since if you had a flyer you could\nhave got in for free before 11:30pm or\nfor only a fiver after, and I had given\naway two hundred of them.\nWithin minutes of getting on the dance-floor, I was grabbed by a woman who\nkept telling me her name was Louise. I thought \"Result\"! Having only been In\nthe club ten minutes I was being pulled\n- things were looking up. It was only after\nthe 'Louise' in question dragged me\naway to a quiet spot and said her name\nwas not Louise and that she was, in fact,\nafter some contraband narcotics. (I'm sure you can work out which ones rhyme\nwith Louise) that I knew that I hadn't pulled. On top of that I clearly looked like\na drug dealer. Perhaps I should have\nsold her a couple of Strepsils (I had a sore\nthroat that night).\nThe music was great, a range of house\nmusic varying from cheese y to the\nharder side all expertly mixed by Frankie\nFoncett, DJ Marble and Justin Ballard.\nAlso the packed dancefloor and decor all\nadded to the atmosphere. There were\ntwo rooms running, the main floor with\nall the house music and the downstairs\nroom with old classics and more funky\nsounds.\nThis night, as a few others, including\nPropaganda (voted London's best club\nnight out in 'Timeout'), are run by John\nand Krista (their company is called\nEnigma). When I asked John why he\ncharged so little for entry into club when\neveryone else charged a fortune, he\ntold me that he didn't believe that people should pay silly prices to get Into a club, especially students. Of course,\nthey make their money at the bar (\u00a33.50\nstarting prices) but then it's up to you if\nyou buy a drink. It's an attitude that\nshould be applauded - when so many\npromoters are charging a fortune this\nSingles\nSingle of the Week\nFlashback\n'Start Da Move'\nSuperb euro-house track coming out of\nItaly on the Slamm label, the 12\" has\nthree mixes, with the A side giving you\na very uplifting, progressive euro-track.\nFull of pianos, strings and breakdowns.\nThe other side has a couple of house\nmixes. It's a great dance track with a very\ncatchy tune.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nT Power\nWho Gives a Funk'\nFunky single, but too boring and far too\nbland. There are two different singles on\nthe 12\" and the second is simply a funk\ntrack with a hard bass line. Both tunes\ngo on forever and you get bored waiting\nfor the track to kick in - sadly, it never\ndoes.\nWeed\n'If Only U Could See'\nExcellent single with a host of remixes\ngiving lots of variety. A couple of mixes\ngive a very vocal, uplifting and chilled version which is great for easy listening.\nThere is also a dub mix which gives a superb progressive angle and the album\nversion gives aD&B interpretation.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBrooke Russell\n'So Sweet'\nA great R&B track. This features add i tonal vocals from Mr Gentleman and is a funky\nuplift ng track. The radio mix is the best,\nbut for so em thing more slow and a bit\ndeep check out the Headrush mix. Wonderful vocals, great tune, top single.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFreestylers\n'B Boy Stance'\nNot a bad hip-hop/funk track but too\nboring and all the mixes sound the same.\nThe vocals are clear and the tune is really\ncatchy. But there are seven mixes, and\nonce you've heard the first track, you've\nheard the CD. If there was more variety\nthere it would be great.\nAphexTwIn\nWlndowllcker'\nMore superb mu sci al madness from the\nTwin. There are a few mixes on this great\nsingle. The first is a chilled out, slow beat\nversion - a slow melodic song that makes\ngreat listening. The other two mixes are\nsimply weird. They have weird names\n(one is a maths formula!!) and are a collection of random sounds. Not as good\nas some of his earlier work, it's still a good single. Check out the sleeve of the\n12\".\nHollls P Munroe\n'I'm Lonely'\nAn excellent slow, deep house tune\nwhich was completed in 3 hours and was\nco-written by Terence Trent D 'Arby\n(remember him? No, didn't think so),\nsampling his \"And I need to be with\nsomeone tonight\". There are a few\nmixes on the CD version. The first two\nsound exactly the same, whilst the last is\na very fast, progressive version. Out this\nmonth.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 j& M guy charges sweet fuck all and you still\nhave a great night. Fallen Angels was\ngood - not mind blowing, but very\nimpressive nonetheless. The music is\ngreat, and there is a good, warm friendly\natmosphere in the club (it's a mixed\nnight). It's not going to cost an arm and\na leg to get in, and you don't have to\ndrink. Indeed, for the entry price it's a fantastic night out. Enigma will be playing at HG again soon and I 'll have more\ntickets for free entry, so if you're interested then pop into Felix for details on\nthis and other Enigma nights.\nGurm\nGurm\n\n"

    "content": "15 March 1999 Arts 23\nSULPHUR 16 - RANDOM DANCE COMPANY\nQueen Elizabeth Hall\nT he Random Dance Company has\nbeen part of the contemporary dance scene for quite a while, creating some of the most exciting and daring works around. They combine traditional modern moves with electronically animated Images. The artistic\ndirector and choreographer, Wayne McGregor, has assembled a company of 8 dancers including himself. Apart\nfrom being on the cutting edge of dance,\nhe is also a respected choreographer in\ntheatre and film - he has worked on A Little Night Music, Anthony and Cleopatra\nat the National, Cleansed at the Royal\nCourt and the film version of the play\nBent. His latest piece is a70 minute long mix of his usual ingredients; tremendously innovative dance moves blended with computer-animated images, which tend to be projected on the back of the stage while the dancers are performing. At the beginning, the artists come on dressed entirely in red(one of the dancers is also the costume designer).\nMost of the moves are done lying on the floor. The electronic music that opens the\nshow is very intense and becomes quite\ndifficult to bear after a short while. But\nthis is part of McGregor' s world. The dancing is very slow at first, but gradually\nas the piece unfolds, the show gets more\ninteresting. The music develops variety,\nalternating between ambient, more frantic sounds and classical string music. The\ncomputer animations appear later on. At\nfirst, the artists simply play with the electronic screens, then they project animated dancers on the performers, creating an inspired duo between reality\nand virtual it y. At this point, the show really strikes the audience. The various\nideas include a dancer covered in black\nwith others in white with flashing neon lights. The end sequence is beautiful\nwith all of the elements of the show effectively coming to their natural\nheights.\nBy the time the dancers have finished performing, you get the feeling of\nhaving experienced something extraordinary. This is definitely groundbreaking art, incorporating the more established\naspects of dance with the ultra-modern\ntechniques of computers. This does raise\nthe questions of how well these kinds of crossovers actually work and whether they can still be considered as art. I think\nthe answers arc to be found in works like\nSulphur 16. The mixture of different\nmedia is perfect and the result is awes ome. The energy that comes across\nfrom the close collaboration between these artists is inspiring for people who are looking for new directions in art.\nThese are 'in your face1 ways of stating\nthat anything is possible as long as the\ninitial ideas and actual work are good. Sulphur 16 is without a doubt brilliant\nstuff. The company will be back in Lond on later this month(28 th March), so\ndon't miss them. D. ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE\nEnglish National Opera, London Coliseum\nRecently, I reviewed the stunning production of Parsifal at the ENO. Orpheus and Eurydice is another\nopera running there simultaneously. It\nwas written in the 18th century by the\ncomposer Gluck. The show Is a revival of a very successful 1997 production. The\noriginal director, Martha Clarke has revamped it slightly with the help of another director, but overall she has stayed faithful to her first staging. The story of Orpheus and Eurydice is very\nfamous an old myth that is always\nbeing retold. The opera begins with\nOrpheus in hell. The spirits dance around him and he feels that he has lost\nhis wife Eurydice forever. Amor appears,\nin the form of a woman, and tries to comfort Orpheus. He is then cursed; if\nhe wishes to keep his wife, he must\nnever look at Eurydicc straight in the eyes. Of course, Orpheus does so and she dies instantly. Amor returns to save the situation, somehow resuscitating her, and the couple lives happily. The spirits also stop being tormented in heil and apparently\n. become free. At this point, a little girl walks around the stage throwing red petals everywhere.\nThe story is definitely not the reason to go to this\nopera. I even had a fight with a friend about whether this\nversion was faithful to the original myth or not. The singing\nis wonderful. The role of Orpheus is sung by a counter-tenor, which is in my opinion the most beautiful\nvoice in opera. The two women were also very\ngood but somehow the Polish artist, Arlur Ste. fan owicz, managed to outshine his co-stars,\nj jk The music is simply delicious, poetic and i:;;:!i Glui k's ideas arc; lovely, with\na choir singing throughout k the opera, sometimes backing up Stcfanowicz\nin the most beautiful\nI way. The spirits are'' played by eight dancers.\nIhe < h oreo graph y is very\nmodern with no particular style. In fact,\nthe dancing was more about movement and giving the opera a physical touch.\nIt was very effective and the use of the set was quite amazing. The decor represented hell with lots of rocks scattered all over the stage in no obvious\nlayout. The dancers used these rocks to\nshow the different moods of the hero.\nAt one point, they were naked, adding a strong dimension of bareness and sadness to the second act. The directing\nand design are both in tune with the per-former s. This is light entertainment, very\nbrief (only one and a half hours without\nan interval) and accessible to music-lovers and newcomers alike. The ENO has once more shown its ability to put\non brilliant productions that draw\ncrowds. This is definitely worth seeing.\nD. "

On a fair day in early 1999 a tra-d it ional auction of indentured personnel was held within the grounds of this noble establishment that we know as Imperial College Union. At the said\nauction Mr Ince was purchased for the substantial sum of twenty pounds ster-ling( approximately32 euro); an amount raised jointly by Mess rs Paul\nHickman, la in Campbell, Jonathan Dixon and Nicholas Towers. To their grave disappointment Mr Ince never put in an appearance to\ncarry out the services thus purchased. No small degree of distress was experienced by his temporary masters as a result of this failure. We would like to hereby request that the said gentleman, Mr Chris Ince, be requested to contribute an amount of money to the organisation known as Imperial College Union RAG, as a penalty for his\ndisgraceful oversight. The said amount is to be determined by Imperial College Union RAG,.but should be no less\nthan the sum paid in the original trans-action.

At this meet the traditional\nprocess of questioning the candidates for the various posts was been carried\nout cordially, up to the point that our ICU President Elect, Natasha Newton, opened her mouth. She asked a candidate about the contents of a private\nconversation they had with her, where the candidate was asking her in confidence various questions concerning their candidacy. Ms Newton was ask-ing whether this did not weaken the candidate's position. OK so what' s so wrong with this?\nWell the audience immediately sensed the wrong in the natur e of the question, Ms Newton had deliberately scraped up the contents of a private\nconversation that the candidate( also\na friend of mine) had stupidly assumed was to be held in confidence. To their\ncredit both the crowd and the chair\nmade their feelings known. At worst our new President Elect\nwas playing cheap politics for cheap gain, at best her immaturity was showing. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I'd advise her to grow up, maybe an adviser would be useful. Standing for candidacy in Hustings is\nnot easy at the best of times and our President, of all people, should support\ncandidates with good advice and not\nundermine them thereafter.\nyours sincerely\nDeepak Ray\n5th yr. medic SingSoc Spectacular\nDear IC,\nI write to congratulate the Singaporean Society on their production \"ON Made in Singapore\", held in the Great Hall on the 6 th.

    "content": "26 Sport 15 March 1999\nRIFLE CLUB\nUniversity of London v The World\nAt 6.30amon Saturday UL U should have\nleft for Sutton Coldfield, but unfortunately one member of the team didn't get up in time (Sorryl). Arriving late to the sight of snowflakes the size of dinner\nplates, the team quickly established themselves and, fighting their Friday\nnight excesses, got down to some serious shooting. With so many IC members on the team (6 out of 10) the outcome was almost inevitable, with London beating Edinburgh by a comfortable1 point(1158 to1157), with no other teams coming close. Notable performances came from London Captain Rachael\nAmbrose(193) and Gareth Hllller (195).\nPhilip Golds (192) and Dan Booker(191)\nwere the other notable IC scores. Rachael and Gareth both went on to the\nfriendly England-Scotland international\nwith Rachael getting a maximum100 In\none of her shoots.\nOther notable events include beating Southampton at a Mini-Bus rocking\ncompetition and a declaration of shenanigans against Edinburgh who engraved themselves as the1997 winners eventhough London won that\nyear.\nULTIMATE FRISBEE\nBrunei Falcons 15\nIC 9\nThis was IC's first away match of the\nsouth-east outdoor league. After winning our first 3 matches fairly convincingly we were confident of delivering\nanother ass-kicking. Things started going a bit pear-shaped when our 4 most experienced players were forced to miss the match due to illness or work load (or perhaps back problems and laziness).\nWe were ready to clock up another\nmomentous IC victory. That was until the\nthreatening black skies chose this point\nto piss all over us. It was quite evident\nwhen Brunei started to score In to the wind, as well as with the wind, that this\nwas not going to be another 'easy' win. We came up with the novel idea of tactics, or even possibly a strategy, as away of overcoming our3 point deficit.\nWe returned to the battle ground with\na feeling that we could win. How care-less, Brunei rapidly knocked up a5 point\nlead, to which IC had no reply. The last\npoint of the match went to Brunei as\nwell. There was little chance for a flowing team performance, but 'Short Bald\nGuy' did score over half our points. We were out played in harsh conditions,\nbut there will be revenge.\nNETBALL\nIC 9\nKing's48 At the start of the match we were all in\na positive mood, hoping that playing at\nhome would give us a badly needed advantage over a team that had already\nbeaten us twice this season.\nThe 1 st quarter was promising with\ngood defence from Alex, Kirstie and Dorothy keeping the ball out of the IC\ngoal third. Vikki and Paula worked with\nmuch determination in the centre third\nto feed the ball to the shooters. The return of Sarah after a wrist injury to partner Sally meant that we had our first full\nteam in along time.\nSome dynamic changes to the IC\nteam in the last quarter caused a dramatic increase in pace; with 5 minutes\nleft to go, the shooters finally managed to find the net, doubling IC's goal tally.\nHowever, we are pleased to report\nthat since the last King's match, Abbie has sorted herself out,putting in a decent performance without any blatant dissent to the umpire. Previously\nshe managed to piss off the King's captain ( who umpired) over her failure to\nreturn to her line in an acceptable time.\nNever mind girls - an easy three\npoints for us against ICSM next week( yeah, right!)\nHOCKEY\nICII 3\nRoyal Holloway II 3\nIn this UL league 6-pointer the points\nended up shared. After a tense 15 minutes we found ourselves 2 - 0 down to\n2 soft goals. The2 nd goal, though, gave our team impetus to play like a team inspired with smooth one-touch\nhockey and great movement off the ball. Our first goal came when Geography Teacher negotiated a pass\nthrough the terrain, taking the play up\na level to Multi-Storey who slotted the\nball into the bottom right corner. Comments from the goalscorer are reported\nas containing phrases such as \"the greatest goal at Harlington\" but this has not\nbeen confirmed. We went in at half-time 2-1 down and with an inspiring speech by JeanClaude, we went out to win. Holloway\nquickly found themselves tango' d, although not very efficiently. Holloway\nthen, against the run of play, scored an illegal goal, which was blatantly lifted in\nthe D. With 15 minutes togo, a successful navigation from Geography Teacher found the back of the goal.\nMany opportunities were present during\nthe match for IC and several times the ball was cleared off their goal line. Game summary? Our brilliance versus their\nluck.\n\n"

The track-listing is good, with tracks ranging from\nslow and funky, to the faster garage\nsound. Tracks include \"Feeling Fine\",\n\"Groove in Me\", \"Ultimate Love\" and \"Body\"\nto name a few.

People often think of techno as\nbeing highly one-dimensional and stereo-typical. But, as usual, they are sadly mis-taken, and this is most definitely shown up\non this record.

And the\nbest of these is easily Creeper ll's 'Spoke,'-a bouncy, confident piece of s of tish techno that would get any crowd going to\nthe limit.\nSome of these tracks were played by\nthe DJs at Escape From Samsara recently,\nand if that isn'ta compliment then I don't know what is. Although ClusterFuck is not\neven half as trance y as what you'd expect\nfrom the Escape From Samsara people, it\nis still packed full of enough twists and turns to keep any lover of dance music\ninterested in listening, or dancing, to it all\nnight long.\nThis is for those of you who love a bit\nof British techno, but also it's one in the\neye-of those who think techno is dull,\nmindless, and going nowhere.

    "content": "12 Film 15 March 1999\nThe Thin Red Line * * *\nStarring : Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, James Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson\nDirector: Terrence Malick\nHe's behind you. BANC. Oh, he was on your side. Sorry.\nDespite being one of the most\nacclaimed directors of his gene r ation, director Terrence Malick\nhasn't made a movie in the last twenty\nyears. And, to be honest, it shows. What\nhe presents us with here reeks of seventies anti-Nam anger, coupled with the kind of long-drawn-out, meandering style that was popular when the entire\naudience was out of their head on psychedelic drugs.\nOn paper, it might sound dangerously close to Saving Private Ryan territory\n- a 'realistic' (yet all-star) vision of what it\nwas really like for the average squad die in\nthe Second World War, delivered from a very American perspective. However, whilst Ryan still displayed certain elements\nof your bog-standard Sunday afternoon\nwar movie. The Thin Red Line has far\nmore in common with Platoon, FullMetal\nJacket and Apocalypse Now - this, of course, is no bad thing. Yet whilst the latter were fired by their directors personal\nvisions (and indeed experience), to create\na truly seminal, life-altering picture of war,\nThe Thin Red Line is devoid of any driving\npassion. It bumbles along, without plot or\nmotivation, and finally reaches a point\nwhere it simply stops. For no apparent reas on. Apart from the fact that, having\nmeandered along for three hours, any\nmore would seem excessive.\nLike Private Ryan, it provides non stop streams of grisly images (although\nnone to match the Omaha landings in\nSpielberg's movie), and resolutely refuses\nto let you pick out the good guys and the\nbad guys - and from that point of v ie w it\nsucceeds. You're forced to understand\n( once again) that this isn'ta battle\nbetween good and evil (or at least not\nwhen viewed from this level). But we've\nbeen there before. Other directors have\nmade the same point, and made it far bet-ter. Moreover, they've made it without the\nneed to throw in a mega star every few\nminutes to wake the audience up (there's no other reason for the sudden appearances of Travolta, Cusack and Clooney).\nThey've also done it without resorting to\nthe kind of\" meaningful\" voice-overs that\nsound like they've been written by a bunch of stoned English students.\nHarsh all this may sound, but the\npoint is that if a great director (Badlands\nand Days of Heaven attest to that) keep\nus waiting for twenty years, and then his\nmovie is hailed as \"the most important\nfilm of the nineties\", you're going to have\nvery high expectations. As it stands, it's a decent movie, fuelled with some cracking\nperformances and brilliant cinematography - but by refusing to justify its running\ntime or provide us with anything new, it\nmust ultimately, be judged a disappointment.

We had made it to the final\nlast year only to lose to LSE by as le nder four goal margin, so as you can imagine passions were running high. Credit must goto Q MW whose fans\nturned up with drums, trumpets and even played Take That as their players\nentered the arena. However, they did lack a certain something talent!\nPeople should not be fooled by the hefty score line; this was a close game at 1 -1 until about fifteen minutes\nto go when Amo broke the hearts of Q MW with a wonder strike.\nDespite taking an early lead Impe rial looked very nervous in the first half.\nThis may have something to do with the abuse each player received from Chris\nSo berg in the player profiles In the prog ram.I would like to take this opportunity to return the favour, you fat\nNorwegian turd!\nThe first goal came from Dirty Warren who latched on to a perfect\nthrough ball from Jamie and slotted it\nhome. However, after we scored, our play seemed to deteriorate and ten mins before the break Q MW was level.\nWe came into the changing room with our heads down but thanks to a stern talking to by Jamie, everyone's attitudes changed in the second half and things started to click. Our defense tightened up to its usual \"crab's arse\"\nself. QM W's main striker was kept\nunder control by Chris and so-so who played on despite having his face mauled earlier in the game. They had no more play down the left either as\nthis was religiously guarded by Brother\nPhil.\nOur sexy midfield started playing\nsome sexy football but despite efforts\nfrom Alex, Till and Dave we couldn't break through. Then came the turning the point of the game, with about fifteen minutes to go and a couple of minutes after Eric\nhad brilliantly saved along distance\nshot, Amo picked up the ball on the right, cut inside and tried his luck form thirty yards.\nThe instant the ball left his foot\nscreaming for mercy, everyone knew it\nwould end up in the top corner.\nThe only word that can be used to describe the celebration is carnage. Fans broke through the stewards and streamed on to the pitch, Yellow Subm ari ne could be heard in all neighboring countries and Magic downed a bottle of whisky to earn the \"Fan of the match\" award. Q MW had no reply to this and every\ntime we had the ball we looked like\nscoring. Dirty Warren finished off a squeaky clean performance with two more excellent goals to get his hat-trick, and big Dave silenced the crowd with the fifth.\nA huge thankyou must go to all of you that came to support us. You spurred us on and I hope we did you proud. regain BUSA trophy\nWe arrived bright and early on Saturday\nmorning, and immediately drew Loughborough in the semis. Fencing e pee were\nRob Neurnberg, Ed Rysdale and Karaoke\nDave Davidge. Rob fenced very well winning\nall his fights, with Dave and Ed won two out\nof three each. Sabre came next, with\nThorsten destroying all his opponents and\nour captain, Dave Hughes, winning two out\nof three, and making up for a lacklustre performance from Mo Mansoori. So Karaoke\nDave, Ed and Henry Morton had to fence\nand win two fights to make sure we were\nthrough - they did and we were. After lunch\nwe lined up against Oxford (1998 champi-ons). Lpee (their strongest weapon) was first\nagain and Rob was unfortunate not to win\nall three. Both Ed and Karaoke Dave did well\nto get a fight each. So to the sabre, and again\nwe won4 out of 9 (Mo taking two fights and\nDave and Thorsten winning one each),\nwhich took us into the final weapon (foil)\nneeding to win six. There was probably\nhope in the hearts of Oxford, but this was\nsoon vanquished by wonderful fighting\nfrom our fol lists. They all won without problems to take the BUSA team trophy back into\nIC posse sion after a one year absence.\nSCOREBOARD\nFOOTBALL\nWednesday10 th March ULU League\nUCL 1 2 - 4 ICI\nICII 9-1 IC III\nIC IV 2-1 UCL III\nRoyal Hoi. 15-0 IC Ladies\nLSE IV 1-2 IC IV\nICSM 6 - 0 RHUL\n(ICSM promoted to UL U Premier Ige)\nICVI 1 4 - 1 Heythrop\nSaturday 6th March ULU Cup Final\nIC 5-1 Q MW RUGBY\nICI 2 8 - 1 4 ICSM I( The report never turned up.

Imperial entered every event with\ntwo or three (always willing) athletes in\nmost.\nMarie, Mike and Dave contested the\nPole Vault and Michele and Anne completed ICs first 1-2 in the women's ham-mer. Khaled and Marie won the individual\nhigh jumps with Khaled eventually clearing 1.95m for his first victory of the day.\nOn the track Angus set a P.B. in a surprise 5K win, while Julia took the 100 and Katherine the 400 in 60.2. Imperial were\nnow well ahead of their nearest rivals.\nJames and Julia won the 400m hurdles\nevents in 59.1 and77.1 respectively.\nSouhad finished 2nd and3 rd in the triple\nand long jumps, while Nadia came 2nd in\nthe 800m. Marvin and Hedley finally turned\nup with Marv collecting precious points in\nthe 110 hurdles, long and triple jump.\nVicki Frew completed her IC adoption\nand in the absence of serious competition\nwon the1500 and3000 m. The only\nremaining sprint final was the men's200m but hopes of the day's first 1-2-3 had to\nwait, as Ed Johnson, competing in his\nfourth event, came second, clocking the\nsame time as the winner.\nThe steeplechase saw a tactical battle\nas the Imperial pack hung back and let the\nearly leader get wet. The team coped well\nto finish as the first four runners.\nThe day finished with Imperial winning all four relays after Holloway dropped their\nbaton in the rush for revenge in the 4 x100m. The final table was;\nI. Imperial 414\n2. Holloway 294\n3. Queen Mary / Westfield 117\n4. St Georges 66\nKhaled and Marie finished as the days\nmost successful individuals. Khaled\nclocked three wins, a4 th and a5 th, while\nMarie won three events and finished second in three others. There were many\nother unsung heroes including Boaz,\nAndreas, Ed Lee, Anna and Giles who threw, jumped, hurdled and ran whenever\nasked. The trophy was collected and everyone retired for some well earned\ndrinks. With the majority of team here next\nyear, Mike and Khaled shouldn't have to\ntry too hard to retain the trophy.\nHOCKEY\nLeague Champions!\nIC Firsts rose from a quiet decade and stormed to UL Cup victory last year.\nThis time around, the team's experience\nand maturity showed, and outright domination was quickly achieved in the BUSA\nqualifiers. Then, came Xmas, down to\nbusiness: the London League and Cup.\nOutstanding performances include the92 trouncing of UC LMS, 7-1 at St. Barts\nand 6-1 to finish off Q MW. After 6 of the\n7 games in the league, we had done enough. Imperial are League Champ ions for the first time in many, many years!\nWith a solid defence featuring the\ngreatest skipper since the war, MrT; a legendary midfield, including one of the greatest players IC has ever seen; and a forward line that has scored in\nexcess of 72 goals thus far, (excluding\nthose by the midfield and defence), the\nIC bandwagon has once more moved on its way to the UL Cup Final.\nReaching the Final was achieved\nwith three convincing wins over St.\nGeorge s,Q MW and UCL scoring16 goals along the way. This display of\nchampagne hockey has meant that we play Royal Holloway in the final, again.\nWe'll report next week with news of the\nIC 1st teams double... without a doubt.\n\n"

    "content": "24 IC Radio 15 March 1999\no DJ's Sianide & Desire have been presenting a hardcore and hard house dance show for the last 18 months. Over this period,\nthey have developed a reputation for being on the cutting edge of dance music and presenting an excellent quality show. This\nweek they tell us about the new releases on the scene . . .\nAt present, the hardcore scene see j| rs lo becoming on very nicely, with plenty of new tunes and remixes from the like! of Ham, Storm, BANG!, Hixxy, ct cetera. Sony's support of many of the finest producers led to the release of the 'Nuffin But Noise1\ncompilation, opening up this style of music to a wider audience. With the quality\nof tunes going from strength to strength, hardcore should survive for years to come. Also, thanks to Kaos and Energy for coming down last Thursday evening for the inter-view.\nCover Up - Case I A stupidly catchy tune by an artist whose name cannot be mentioned. Absolutely\nbrilliant breakdowns but is a little on the slow side compared to some of the other\ntunes being released at the moment. This has to be my tune of the week as it has\nbeen produced beautifully and just flows from beginning to end. Top marks to the geezer who made this one. I lard house is still a very pro mim ut us icon the scene, being played out\nat a large amount of clubs around Bh do n.Af Sw labels are producing some excellent quality material currently, almost to the point where you can buy a record off\nthe label without even hearing it! Below are some reviews of my favourite tracks\nthis week... Tekno Kings - The Spirit [Shock Records]\nA typical Shock Records release: good bass line, pumping beats and excellent break-downs. The flip side remix is quite a bit faster, with harsher synths and a more intense\nfeel about It. It seems as if Shock is going from strength to strength at the moment with releases being on an almost fortnightly basis.\nDreadland (Sy + Unknown Remix)\n[Quosh Records]\nBuilds even further on the remix of Tiny Tot's Discoland by adding a wicked\ndrum & bass section with a seriously\ndeep bass line, perfect for scratch at tacks. The original vocals have been kept but the majority of the instrumentation has been changed. All in all\na top remix.\nDJ Sy DJ Seduction\nDigital Masters - Terminator\n[Shock Records]\nYet another release from Shock\nRecords, this really is a quality tun c. Samples are dropped in from the film\n'Terminator' at such a rate not to go over the top. The Schwarzenegger mix is the best of the two, but it's a tough decision to make, as both of them are wicked tunes. The dark bass\nline and the+150 bpm beat makes this\ntrack yet another classic.\nBecks - Dynamite (The remix) [Stage One] Hard Beat 5 EP-Vaiious artists [Nucleuz]\nThis is one of my favourite tunes at the moment, probably due to the excellent vocals,\ncleverly panned melody and the general energy which it seems to possess. This\none is guaranteed to get people moving and get those hands in the air. Watch\nout for the Stage One album \"WOW! What a Rush\" which features this tune and loads\nof other great remixes by artists such as Triple J. DJ Seduction - Leaving the world behind (Ham remix) [Impact Records]\nI considered the original version of this tune released on Hardcore Heaven recordings (Seductions sub-label) to be as good as Sedders gets, but when you get Ham doing a remix, you know it is going to be good. The lush breakdowns have remained\nsimilar to the original but the rest of the tune has had a proper Next Generation\nworkout and the result is brilliant. Another Impact classic.\nHam, Demo + Justin Time - Here I Am ( Ham remix) [Stage One] When I first heard this song I was pretty critical as DJ Brisk did a really good remix\na couple of years ago. Once the vocals kicked in I thought to myself \"This really\nis different\". The whole thing has been reworked and the vocals have been subtly vo coded, which really makes this tune stand out from the previous remixes. Ham seems to be the man for remixes at the moment, let's hope we hear even more like this in the future.\nThree excellent cuts here from a label that you can rely on. My personal favourite\nis by The 49ers and is a track called / got the music. The sounds used are of a ve\nold skool nature backed by a good strong beat with nice, flowing vocals over the\nbreakdown. The other two tracks are of a slightly downtempo style with some cheeky samples dropped in to say the least! My advice - buy it. Now. Code 42 Higher- [United Ravers Recordings]\nA release from Europe on a label which has now got an unbeatable reputation on the trance scene. It was no surprise to find that this was an excellently produced tun c, with a slightly slower remix to accompany the main track. Wicked vocals,\npounding beats and deep acid b lines, need I say anymore. At over 1 SObpm, this\nmusic is not for the light-hearted.\nLock on to Sianide and Desire every Thursday night\nbetween 10 and 11 p.m. on IC Radio - 999 am. Spin UK!\n\n"

'\"\nAlbums\nTHE AFGHAN WHIGS\nThe 'Whigs - don't mess with them\nor their mother'll 'ave ya.\nT his band have been going for\n11 years now and have released\nnumerous albums. They were the first non-northwestern band signed to the Sub-pop label - the label that\nwould first launch Nirvana into the lime-light. Times change and the band are now with Columbia, this being their\ndebut for the label. So it seems strange\nthat a label of Columbia' s size only\nthinks about pushing the record now, considering it was released in October of last year. Apparently this has something to do with the band touring here\nsoon or something along these lines.\nThe album has been touted as being the Whigs' most mature record yet, and whilst I'm not familiar enough with their\nearlier material to comment on this, it is\nfair to say that there is a maturity to the sound. Perhaps some of this is due to the fact that the band have enlisted the support of The Royal Orleans Revue.\nThis means that the sound is supplemented to the point of sounding full, but\nnever to the point of being overwhelm ing. This record is a lot more than your\nbasic rock album strings, pianos and female backing vocals are all used In\nways that have impact and yet remain\nsubtle. The songs themselves are well\nwritten, managing to appear as songs rather than a nice collection of phrases,\nsomething many bands are guilty of.\nGreg Dulli, the lead singer, has\nstated that 'guilt takes a backseat to lust\non this album.' He should know, as after\nall he has sole credit for almost all the songs. Although he maybe slightly misstating things as on the song Neglekted,\nhe states 'You can fuck my body, baby.\nBut ple eze( sic), don't fuck my mind'. Otherwise it's true, lust completely dominates things. Not a surprise when you read interviews with Dulli. The tone of the record is on the whole mellow, but\nthere are times when the music and vocals decide to soar.\nThe album never really goes at\nthings full pace. Some times the pace is\npicked up a little, as on the track John\nThe Baptist which manages to sound like a theme from a seventies cop movie.\nThe album isn't perfect, for a start it's a little short - there's eleven tracks, of which one is an instrumental and another is twenty seconds of some woman supposedly in the act with Dulli.\nOtherwise the only other complaint is\nthat the style of most songs is not that\nvaried. Other than these complaints there's nothing majorly wrong and the packaging' s quite good as well. 0\nJamie\nLIZ HORSMAN\nHeavy High\nLiz Horsman - not quite got round\nto chucking out all her old Felixes.\nAt the grand old age of Forty\nodd, pop/rock music is a poly-mes m eric beast, diverse and eclectic as ever, bul simultaneously repetitive and self-indulgent. What goes around does indeed come around: Janis Joplin; singing, guitars,\nbass, drums, very good indeed, fi zH or s man; singing, guitars, bass, drums,\nnot much cop really. Same structure,\ndifferent product. Consider an American Gl casting an impress i ble gaze: filmed by Spellberg, crass and labour ed; filmed by Malick, subtle emo tion of immeasurable depth. Same structure, different product.\nBooks and covers, books and covers,\nI fall for it every time. Great case and lay-out, not so great contents. When will I learn? Mind you, as a German answering\nFred once said, 'If existence isn't an aesthetic phenomenon then what else is it?'\nAnd Liz, you would of got away with it,\nif it wasn't for those pesky kids telling you. to open your mouth and play your gui-tar.\nThat's not to say the entire album is\ndrivel. The upbeat numbers may sound like a poor Sheryl Crow( yes, that bad)\nbut the slower numbers do attract your\nattention, but in the words of George Lucas, 'Emotionally involving the audie n ce is easy. Anybody can do it blind-folded, get a kitten and have some guy\nwring its neck.' Viz. pop-rock music; mournful singing, piano and a splash of strings may engage on a superficial level,\nbut they don't necessarily effect a deep-rooted emotional response; on the surface all is well, but deep down obvious\nand empty semantics prevail.

The results were announced at a bar night, which also\ncelebrated the birthday of their mascot,\nTheta.\nAround a hun dred and forty votes\nwere cast in each election, representing around five percent of the electorate. This\ncompares to a turnout of about fifteen\npercent in the recent Sabbatical elections. This did mean, however, that the counting took less than an hour to complete. Will Bently, currently the RCSU's Vice President (Finance), was elected as President, collecting sixty-three votes after\none reallocation and defeating James\nFarrar, the other candidate and Editor of Broadsheet. Mr Bently said that he was \"happy to have won\", and hoped to By Gareth Morgan\nhelp the RCSU\nimprove next year.\nCurrent Welfare\nofficer Jason McKee and President\nSimon Torn both comfortably defeated RON to\nwin the otherwise uncontested posts\nof Vice President\nClubs and Entertainments) and Vice\nPresident (Finance)\nrespectively.\nDepartmental Photo: Rachael The Returning Officer Representative ele c hits rush-hour t ions also took place.

Surprise guests at the bar night were City and Guilds mascots, Spanner and Bolt, along for the occasion (and free\nbeer). The highlight of the evening was the life-sized Theta cake, made for the occasion by Simon Torn and Jo Churchill.\nSports Hall Delay\nThe plans for the news ports hall,\nrefurbished tennis courts and redevelopment of Beit\nQuad may all be in jeopardy this week. The applications for the redevelop mc nts, currently going through Westminster and Chelsea County Council, have hit set backs caused by the actions of a few students. David Hel lard, President of Imperial College Union explained \"all major developments in South Kensington have togo through the local council. For an application to be approved it has to have the backing of the local residents. Normally this is not a problem, but when our students continually terror is e them, they are hardly likely to back proposals that will bring more students into the area.\"\nThe cause of the problem appears to be two incidences in the last two weeks in Southside halls, where students have reportedly been throwing bottles, marmite jars and various other\nglass objects off the hall balconies causing damage, distress and extreme danger to nearby residences. One Senior College Official stated that\nBy the Newsteam\nevery year we have to spend tens of thousands of pounds just putting right the physical\ndamage caused by reckless students,\nnot to mention the money and time spent on reconciling local residences and the council.\" In one of the incidences a peanut butter jar smashed through a garage window, damaging an antique Ferrari.\nHellard added, \"for some reason stud ents find this funny. The individuals\ninvolved happened to be from other\nuniversities and we are currently trying\nto track them down. Under the terms of the Southside license, though, stud ents are responsible for their guests'\nactions and from now on College will\ndiscipline on this basis. College are not\nhappy and will comedown on any similar incidents like at on of bricks, what ever they give as punishment, I 'll make sure they double it.\"\nHe finished by saying \" the actions\nof these students could have ended all\nhopes of a new sports centre, something that is desperately needed and would improve the day to day life of hundreds of students.\" New Unis In Doubt\nSir Ronald Oxburgh,\nRector of Imperial\nCollege, has\ndeclined an invitation from London First,\nthe campaign group, to join learning in\nLondon', a consortium of universities in\nthe capital. Imperial however remains a member of the 'Russell group', an Ivy\nLeague of older universities, an elite set of\ninstitutions that pride themselves on the\nemphasis they place on research. As Sir\nRonald Oxburgh explained in the Evening\nStandard, the universities in this group all\nshare a belief in the importance of academic standards, in \"quality not quantity\".\nUniversity College London, another mem ber of this group, has similarly refused to\njoin the consortium. While Imperial, University College London and the London\nSchool of Economics took three of the top\nfive places in The Times Good University\nGuide, all of London's nine new universities appear in the bottom third of the table, with the Universities of East London,\nNorth London and London Guildhall University all appearing in the bottom ten.\nThe Rector expressed his belief that\nthe creation of the new universities during 1992 in a bid to abolish what he described as the \"binary divide\" between\npolytechnics and universities was \"largely\ndriven financially\", because the unit costs\nof education in the older universities were\nsignificantly greater\nBy Sunil Rao than in the poly tech nics. With a few exceptions, many institutions that were\nonce highly regarded polytechnics are\nnow second-rate universities.\nThe refusal of Imperial to join \"Learn-ing in London\" comes after Thames Valley\nUniversity, famous for its courses in kite-flying, rock music and curry making, was\npublicly named as Britain's first failing University. The former Polytechnic of West\nLondon, originally the Ealing School of\nArt, was damned in a November report\nfrom the Quality Assurance Agency, the\nhigher education watchdog, forcing the\nresignation of vice-chancellor, Dr Mike Fitzgerald. A report published by the Government-funded Higher Education Statistics Agency last August also revealed that\nover 15 per cent of students from Thames\nValley remained unemployed six months\nafter graduation, second only to Coventry.\nAccording to Peter Williams, director\nof institutional review at the Quality Assurance Agency, the new universities should\nacknowledge that degrees must continue\nto be constructive, while balancing the\ndesire to increase student numbers.\n\"Higher education must stay higher. If students come out with a degree which\nnobody believes in, it is not going to do them any favours\".\nBust-A Gut\nOn Friday 5 March, the Bust-a gut comedy club in dB's was filled to capacity with many people being turned away at the door. As usual, Mark Home( Union Ents Manager), introduced\nIhe night announcing the unfortunate\nnews that the scheduled headline act,\nSteve Best, had stood us up! Noone minded as he was to be replaced by the award-winning comedian Chris Addison.\nThe highlight of Mark's introduction was a brilliant put-down to the heckles from\nDave Hellard \"The best thing you've said\nall year!\" - for once Dave was speech less.\nThe evening then continued with\nthe first of the scheduled acts of the night, Lee Canterbury. Within moments of him rising onto the stage, it became apparent that, in a word, he was a complete B rum mien utter! He involved the audience right from the start, by unus u ally heckling them, before they had much of a chance to start on him. As a result,\nhe enticed the crowd into an above average number of heckles. At first he hand led these with great skill, but then seemed to lose heart, as he just couldn't keep up! Despite this, his material was By Oliver & Greg\nof a high standard,\nand kept the crowd\nentertained.\nAfter the interval, with another nos how from the Open Mic contestant, the\nevening moved on to the headline act\nChris Addison. Those of us who remember his performance from last year were\nmore than pleasantly surprised that his\nroutine had improved significantly! He\nbegan with a popular display of hatred\ntowards lesser Universities than our own,\nand also referring (somewhat controversially) to medics as being arrogant! He\nhandled all of the heckles he received\nsuperbly well, although mid way through,\nhis act became baffled by a students\ntaste in hats, which was quickly confiscated by Chris. After his act concluded,\nthe shouts of\" encore\" and enthusiastic\napplause convinced him to return to the\nstage with a few more minutes of\nhumour. And just for you Chris - he was\nescorted from the stage by 80 strippers!\n(I guess you had to be there).\nThe next comedy night will take place\non19 March, with headline act Dave\nGorman, and support from Robin Ince.\nWe hope this will be as enjoyable as all\nthe others have been this term.\n\n"

    "content": "15\nMarch\n1999\nKEEP THE CAT FREE WBt EST 1949\nThe Students' Newspaper at Imperial College Goldsmiths' Gain Tuition Victory\nBy Andrew Ofori\nStudent power has struck a mammoth blow\nin the ongoing campaign against tuition\nfees. Students at Goldsmiths' College were\nrewarded with college support on fees\nafter staging a175 hour occupation of their\nWhitehead Building, in a potent response\nto students being threatened with expulsion for failure to pay tuition fees.\nUnion negotiations with the college\ncame to an abrupt end when eight stu-dents, who had not paid their fees,\nreceived letters terminating their regis tra tion. According to the Union \"It became clear college were prepared to Intimidate\nstudents\", and a rally consisting of 250 students was the first manifestation of their\ndiscontent. The Union subsequently called\nan Emergency General Meeting where the occupation was decided upon. The\nWhitehead Building was taken over on26 February, coincidentally the NUS 'Day of\nAction' against tuition fees. In what was\ndescribed by one Union member as a \"mil-it ary operation\", the protesters organised\nvarious administrative roles such as security and a food committee, and turned the\nacademic and finance building into temporary accommodation with a dedicated\nsleeping area.\nAs the conflict escalated to occupation\nthe college informed protestors it had no\nintention of withdrawing its letters of ter-mi nation. But the campaign was fortified\nby support from a number of celebrities\nsuch as Labour's Ken Livlgstone, comedians Jeremy Hardy and Mark Thomas, and\nRob Newman, who went so far as to give\na free show inside the building. ICU support came in a letter from Dave Hellard, in\nwhich he stated: \"With the NUS currently\ndormant and the threat of differential fees\never real, it is down to the individual Student Unions to show how damaging tuition fees have been and that the Government not the students need to bridge\nthe funding gap.\" Goldsmiths' Union were\nappreciative of the President's backing\ncommenting, \"When you've got support\nfrom Imperial you know you're doing well...it really was heart-warming\".\nThe groundswell of support culminated in the submit tal of an early-day\nmotion in the Commons supporting the\nobjective of the occupation, \"Ultimately\nthis was a confrontation with the Government\" said Goldsmiths' Union General Secretary Sophie Bolt, as she highlighted the\nsignificance of the motion.\nProtestors accepted a High court order\nto end the occupation last Friday, after the\ncollege backed down over the expulsions:\n\"No student will be excluded from college\nbecause of his or her inability to pay fees,\nprovided this can be shown to be the\ncase.\" Ben Pimlott, Warden of the College\nstated: \"The College frequently calls on the\nGovernment to increase funding for further\nand higher education.\"\n\"I therefore fully support calls to ensure\nthat students, as well as the sector in general, receive an adequate share of the\nnation's resources, in line with the Government's education pledge to prior it is e education at every level.\"\nMembers of the Union hierarchy at\nGoldsmiths' are jubilant, and feel their\nactions were fully justified, although the\ncampaign has had its detractors, with some\nstudents unhappy with the disruption to\ntheir courses; one psychology student commented \"Many of us have tried talking to\nthe student leaders and to those involved\nin the occupation, but we are ignored or\nshouted down\". Sophie Bolt, however,\nfeels the resentment stems from the\nactions of the College during occupation,\nreferring to their complete withdrawal of\nlectures in the building when the protestors made every effort to facilitate them\nand the imposition of a blood-relatives\nonly policy for visitors to Halls.\nAccording to London Student (24 February) IC students could soon have their\nown tuition battle to fight, with the possible introduction of Top-up' fees in addition\nto the annual \u00a31000 tuition fees. They are\ndesigned to cover the extra costs incurred\nby attending one of the country's elite uni-vers i ties. The claims were refuted by College Secretary Tony Mitcheson, who stated,\n\"The College has no plans to introduce differential fees\".\n\"Best Week Ever For IC Sport\nAn amazing series of victories for IC's Football, Hockey, Rugby, Athletics and Fencing\nsquads should see our trophy cabinet collapsing under the shear weight of cups,\nawards, league titles and shields which\nhave been awarded in the last seven days\nalone. ICU President Dave Hellard simply\ndescribed the results as \"fantastic\".\nThe most prestigious win came from\nIC's fencers, who regained the BUSA\nNational Championship they last won two\nyears ago. Fully justifying their reputation\nas the country's top student squad (thanks\nto a liberal dose of individual champions\nand national squad members), they rapidly\nsaw off both Loughborough and Oxford.\nDespite a couple of brief scares, the final\nresult was never really in doubt, especially\nwhen the total superiority of our foil team\n(Ed Rysdale, Dave Davidgeand Henry Morton) became apparent.

You know the type - the ones who can't write\ndown the right answer just because it's right; the ones who insist on arguing\ntheir political or religious beliefs at three\nin the morning; the ones who do Aero.\nWell, fes fen is a brilliant example of what\nthis outlook can do to you. Four years ago, a bunch of young Danish directors (including Vinterberg)\ngot together and drew up a set of filmmaking rules, which they called Dog me95. Under these rules, they may only use\nnatural lighting, and must film exclusively\non camcorders. They called these rules a \"vow of chastity\" and insisted that only\nthus could they ensure that their art\nremained pure and true. Of course, everyone else thought they were completely\nb army. So does it work? Well, sort of.\nBecause, despite all their talk of purity, it\nstill comes across like a series of gim icy( and sea-sick) camera positions. On the\nother hand, it adds an impressively realistic slant (through faux-documentary\nDanish cinema. All In the best possible taste.\ngrain in ess and fly-on-the-wall camera work), and gives the movie an Injection\nof pace and urgency into a subject area\nwhich intrinsically lacks these two elements - Mike Leigh-esque family drama.\nYou see, Festen translates as The Celebration, and it's this party - the 60th birthday of an aristocrat - which provides the\nfocus for the movie. We meet the guests\nas they prepare for dinner, and watch by\nas, over the course of the next few hours,\nthey run the gamut of human emotion, via frantic, sex, massive arguments and even suicide. A happy tale it certainly\nisn't, but by leaving his movie free of any\nmoral ising or sentiment, Vinterberg has\nconstructed a hard-hitting and vibrant\ndrama. Dog me remains a strange concept\nwhich I certainly wouldn't recommend to aspiring film-makers, but it has, at least,\nproved that it can work.

Let's RAWK!\nOr not as the case may be.\nOnce upon a time I would have\nunreservedly given this full marks but\ntimes change. Alas, Pist.on haven't cot-toned on to this and whilst it's a decent\nalbum it'll never win any prizes in the originality stakes. If you've ever listened\nto any of the Metal Hammer free CDs you don't need to buy Sell Out because you'll have heard it all before.\nIt's soo ooo formulaic: chugging power chords on the fast songs, monstrous strumming on the slow ones and all this is kept in line by thunderous drums and a bass you can't quite hear.\nDon't get me wrong, the way the album is put together is without fault and the songs aren't necessarily bad, it's just that\nthey're not memorable. Every song runs\ninto every other one and if you're not\ncareful you can lose track of where you are; I missed two tracks while listening to\nthis because I wasn't paying enough attention.\nOne thing I did notice though was that Rest sounds disturbingly like those pre-pubescent Anti pode an rockers Silverchair and the rest of the album is\nwatered-down Metallica. I hate Metallica:\nJames Hetfield reminds me of that longtime Sooty sufferer Matthew Corbett.\nBut it's a bit harsh to say I hated Sell Out\nI still have a soft spot for all this soft Hard\nRock (to coin a musical phrase). I'm rather pleased that it's not all 'Kill your\ndog/ Burn your settee/ Rah, chug ga, chug ga' and more of a pleasant 'Let's have tea/ Go for cake/ Hoover the living\nroom, yeah' vibe which is in part due to\nthose non-threatening vocals.\nThe most disappointing aspect of the whole album is the nagging suspicion that Pist.on just aren't trying. I list e ned to a track of theirs that I had lying\naround called Down And Out and it's exactly the same. It's three years old. You' d have thought that in that amount of time their music would have found a little direction, but it seems to have fu st stagnated and they're quite happy to\nleave it that way. Perhaps if I'd taken time\nto listen to the lyrics I'd have got more out of it but I really wasn't that interested.\nAnd I didn't mention the immense hilarity of their name once. Aren'tIa good boy?

However, as dance music compilations go. Warp Back to Earth has much more to offer than your average offer-ing. For a start, there's two CDs, each\nwith its own style and each with its own merits.\nAs a package the album, consists of work by the Peter-Thomas-Sound-Orchester. The first CD contains remixes of PTSO tracks by a whole host of artists,\nincluding a number of wonderful moments courtesy of mix maestros Coldcut, pop-pioneers Saint Ettiene and the super-chilled Stereolab. The second CD is pure PTSO, and there is no overlap of tracks between the discs.\nThe sound of PTSO is quite unique. I suppose the most appropriate description would be one of a mix between ambient and classical. Many of the PTSO\ntunes lack a beat, and this does on occ a sion sound odd, but the PTSO disc does make a perfect CD to put on if you want to goto sleep.\nThe first CD containing the remixes\nis lends itself to a much more interactive\nlistening session. The sounds are atmospheric, sometimes eerie and always\ninvolving. The piano part on the Coldcut\nremix of Peter in Space is a be aut if u sound that works effectively alongside loud, bellowing electronic effects. This\ntune also includes a strings part that is\nbrought into the tune every so often\nand add seven more to warp the list e ner to worlds uncharted. Another album highlight comes from the Japanese Yoshinori Sun a hara who brings a high quality sound to the album with\nPTvsYS.\nDefinitely not an album to bring you down to earth.

Monumental is the only\nway to describe this trance y tribal fest.\nQuite a good start to any review, I'd say. And now I'm afraid that I'm going to\nbe unable to describe exactly what it\nwas like (especially considering my me a gre writing talents!). But there is a reason\nfor my apprehension. You see to really\nappreciate what Escape From Samsara Is\nall about you have to go along yourself\nand see what all the fuss is about.\nAnd seeing is part of the believing with Escape From Samsara. This is just as\nmuch a visual and spiritual experience as\nit is an aural one. The night is the whole package, but with a difference. Yes, the familiar list of features spring to mind: brilliant LJV decorations, weird dancers on stilts, fabulous venue, jugglers, happy\nbeautiful people, no attitude, funky music, top DJs, balloon drops, freebies at\nthe end( bananas in this place), nice\npromoters, etc. But Escape From Samsara\nhas that little bit extra, that something you can't quite put your finger on. I think it has got to do with the vibe of the\nnight, but don't quote me on this one. See, they've got me talking all New Age now that'show good the night is. Go and try it yourself.\nOnce again, I 'll say it - this is the best\nnight you can go to in London. There is\nabsolutely no contest. Escape from your\neveryday student worries by escaping to Samsara. I know I will (every Friday if\npossible).\nMagical, Mythical, Monumental Roobarb\nShifting Gears Competition\nThanks to the lovely little people at Hard\nHands label, we have the chance to\ngive away 2 tickets to their wonderful Shifting Gears night at the spectacular\nMass nightclub in Brixton. The tickets are\nworth \u00a312 each and are for the Friday\n19th of March outing. All you have to do is to answer this fairly easy question: What way the name of the collaboration\nbetween Leftfleld and John Lyden of the Sex Pistols?\nA bit of a blast from the past I know, but\nto get your hands on this prize just c mail me, Giles Morrison, with the right\nanswer of course, on either:\nGmorr25993@aol.com\ngl les. morrison@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "15 March 1999 Sport & Diversions 27\nFOOTBALL - WINNEY. WINNEY. WIN. WIN - CAN NOTHING STOP IC?\nUCL 1 2\nICI 4\nWell, the cup was won on Saturday and on Wednesday we put ourselves top of the league needing one more win from three games to do the double. The game was won in the first half\nthanks to goals from Amo, Till and Jamie.\nAmo's goal came from an excellent\nmove involving Warren, Till and Alex.\nUnlike previous games, we got stronger\nafter we scored proving to UCL that we are the best in London. It was another\nclass move that led to the second, Warren and Jamie created a half chance for\nTill who smashed it into the top corner.\n\"Dirty\" Warren made the third goal. He received the ball inside the box within\nsecond she was on the deck and a penalty was awarded. Jamie tried his\nhardest to miss but the keeper was fooled by the \"slow' ball.\nThe second half was a scrappy affair\nas UCL finally made a game of it with\nsome forward surges, but in spells we still\nproduced some class football. It was during one of these spells when MarcosWalker-ka-ka scored a nice goal after a slick move.\nICII 9\nit III 1\nThis was a difficult match for both sides\nas the It's were battling to hold on to the top of the league, whereas the Ill's were fighting to stay out of the relegation\nzone. It was immediately clear why IC It's are on top of the league when the ill skipper curled in one of his free-kicks (1-0).\nThis was followed by a sweet free-kick\nfrom John Donovan which was finished\nby \"mighty maestro\" Martin Archibald (2-0). A chip from Julian sent A mahon his\nway, who finished brilliantly (3-0). A John Donovan free-kick set up No.4 which was headed in by 10 ft Tony (4-0). The\n1st half was rounded off by the man in\nform when A mah held off3 players,\nturned and scored from the edge of the\n18 yard box (5-0).\nA replica of the3 rd goal saw10 ft Tony head-in another well executed John\nD free-kick (6-0). The2 nd half was going the same way as the first when defender\nPeter Campbell had the ball in his sights\nand DUCKED61, what.a disgrace. This\ninsult enraged the It's and Jules ripped\nanother swinging free-kick (7-1).\nWhilst Pete Campbell picked himself\nup from the floor. A mah scored his hattrick after he beautifully controlled a high\nball and left the third team's defence behind(81). This one-sided game was finished by\nDarren \" how many chances\" Carpenter\nwhen he finally stopped kicking mud and fumbled the ball into the net (9-1).\nThis was an awkward match, played\nin a good spirit with very little foul play.\nA final mention goes to Lee Jackson who had a blinding game for the third team.\nLSEIV 1\nIC IV 2\nWednesday's game was important for\ntwo reasons. Firstly we needed to continue our quality winning streak, and seco nd ly we needed to prove we were the best fourth team in London. Dave \"the Suit\" Wishart turned up drunk as a lord, and Stu \"Arrested\" Cook and Adam \"Five in his belly\" Gibson both\nhad 5 pints before kick off.\nLSE IV's are the only team who can match us for spirit, but even that wasn't enough today. Nim a \"the man\" Jalali was superb and Stephen \"should've scored\" Dewar pulled through. Although we were one-nil down at halftime, we knew we could turn it around. In the2 nd half\nwe were quite simply first class. Ricki\nequalise d with a goal he lashed into the back of the net, and from then on we showed the true passion of the fourths.\nThe back four played exceptionally well,\nNick \"Rollerblades\" Chapman, Richard\n\"Skinny\" Taylor and Elliot \"Warren\" News ome all playing out of their skins, leaving Stu with nothing to do in the 2nd half.\nIt was left to Gur m to score the winner and what a goal it was!\nWhat a game, what a performance,\nwhat a result. We truly are the best\nfourth team in London. Jurassic Park!\nICVI 14\nHeythrop College 1\nThe sixth'steam last home game of the season resulted in our record win, a141 thrashing of Division Six's so called\" God squad\", who had themselves picked up a shock point against pace-set-ter sR SM II only last Wednesday. The first goal came early, with a confident piece of finishing from midfield\ngeneral Alex, followed by a further three\non the half, punctuated by a lone reply\nfrom the visitors. And we hadn't even\nstarted playing yet.\nAfter the skipper's inspiring half-time\ntalk, we just about shaded the second half 10-0, man-of-the-match Mike encouraging us to go with the flow! After stern\nresistance from the Heythrop defence,\nthe first goal eventually came, and it\ncaused an avalanche. With memories of'98 undiminished, the French partnership in midfield took hold of the game. Super-sub Raby came on to his cus to mary good effect, scoring one of the three\nhat-tricks of the day, the others from\ntop-scorer \"the Doc\" and stressed out\n\"Stan.\" Even \"Wild Thing\" grabbed a brace! The game was also notable for\nthe comeback of the \"Polish Pillar\" in\ndefence, and the discovery of the cap-tain-to-be Nikolich as a dead-ball specialist. This result assures the sixths of a top-half finish, above arch rivals Kings VI\nand is the culmination of a great term,\nincluding recent victories 5-0 over Gold smiths, 8-1 against Georges and a42 humdinger over the aforementioned Berrylands boys. All together now, \"From\nthe pubs of South Kensington...\"\nNEXT WEEK: SEASON REVIEWS\nOK guys, next week is the last issue of the term and marks the end of these a on for rugby, hockey, football and some of the other sports.

    "content": "s Science 15 March 1999\nThe Great Education Debate\nYou're probably paying a lot for your education, but are you getting your money's worth? Is your degree course preparing you to go out Into the great wide world of work? Will you have the skills that employers want? Do you even know\nwhat those skills are? Hilary Cadman looks into why current teaching methods aren't the best way forward...\nT he workplace today is constantly\nchanging and employers, in sci-en ce and in other fields, value adaptable people with a wide range of skills, like initiative, problem solving, communication, creativity, self-confidence, flexibility and teamwork. Unfortunately, schools and universities have done little to respond to\nthese needs, particularly in science.\nTraditional science\neducation generally concentrates on single\nanswer questions and on facts, which must\nbe learnt and regurgitated when exams come round( and can then be forgotten). Lectures are still the main method of teaching at university\nlevel, but what do you learn from them are you expected to participate, to engage your brain, to contribute? More likely it is just a matter of attempting to\nstay awake and note down everything\nthe lecturer says or writes on the board.\nthe system enc our ages students to\nbecome more like\nwalking textbooks\nthan useful scientists\" A final year project may well provide the only opportunity for a science student to\nuse initiative and be creative. Overall, the\nsystem encourages students to become more like walking textbooks than useful\nscientists.\nCan science be\ntaught in away that\ndevelops the skills\nemployers want? A quick look at the Internet suggests that it can\nand surely over a million web sites cant be\nwrong. Okay, not\nmany of them are\nabout science, but\nmost do imply that particular education methods, applied to any topic, will\nencourage the type of skills needed in\nthe modern work environment. In true\nscientific manner, I was sceptical of these\nclaims, for example, the suggestion that\ncreating an 'accepting atmosphere1 in\nthe classroom leads students to be more\ncreative sounds fine in theory, but how is it achieved in practice? Would students\nKoblka Srltharan (left) and Gemma Hancock( right) with the 'Cloudburst' device.\nPicture by kind permission ofthe ll ford Recorder newspaper\nactually notice if their lecturer suddenly slipped from 'critical' to 'accepting' mode somehow I doubt it. Since the Web could offer no concrete solutions, I decided to look elsewhere for ideas on how to improve science teaching.\nL ast year, news coverage of the 'Young Engineers of Britain1\ncaught\nmy eye, when a couple of14 year\nolds from my home town won the award\nfor their age group. Impressed by their\nachievement and thinking they must\nhave some acquired some useful skills in\ndevising their entry, I went along to Bancrofts school to meet the girls, Gemma Hancock and Kobika Sritharan, and their\nteacher, Steven Woolley. Gemma and Kobika won the award for a small device\nthey named 'Cloudburst', which is\npegged on the washing line to detect\nrain and indicate when clothes are dry.\nImpressively articulate, the girls explained\nhow their idea originated from an introductory course in electronics, when they\nwere asked to think of an application for\na circuit completed by water.\nChallenged to make the device they\nhad suggested, the girls did so, working mainly in their spare time in the school's Engineering club. Steven Woolley' emphasised how the students had worked independently on the project,\nbringing their own ideas and enthusiasm\nto solving problems. With no prompting the girls formulated a questionnaire and asked people to test\nthe device, produced a booklet explaining how the idea developed and estimated the cost. Steven Woolley acted more as fac il it at or than teacher offering encourage ment, giving guidance on computer software\nand sourcing materials\nimparting knowledge. This type of project, where students\ndevise and solve a problem themselves,\nappears to be conducive to learning.\nNow on their fifth prototype and bursting with ideas for further improvements,\nthe girls have acquired various skills in\nproducing and presenting their in ven tion, including practical expertise, design,\ncomputing, teamwork, problem-solving,\nself-confidence and communication. Awards filling a table in the school's Engineering club room testify to the fact\n\"an 'accepting\natmosphere' in the\nclassroom leads stu\ndents to be more\ncreative\"\nrather than\nHello, anyone awake at the back?\nthat Gemma and Kobika's success is not\nan isolated event. In the lower sixth,\npupils are encouraged to enter a scheme\nwhich links teams of four students with\nan engineering company. Assisted by a mentor from industry the team works\nover a period of5 months on solving a real problem identified by the company.\nParticipation in the project provides students with valuable skills, and gives them\nan advantage when competing for bur-s aries and scholarships at university level.\nAs a selective, fee-paying school Bancrofts obviously has\nexcellent facilities, but\nSteven Woolley believes that students\nat less well-endowed\ninstitutions could benefit equally from this\nsort of activity. Currently he is en coura g ing pupils from state\nschools in Essex to\ncompete in the ' Micro mouse' competitions, where contestants produce a small\ndevice able to follow a white line, or\nnegotiate amaze. The downside is that\nthese schemes are not part of the general curriculum, students undertake them\nin their free time, if they have an enthusiastic teacher and sufficient motivation.\nSurely such activities, which equip\nstudents with a multitude of sought-after\nskills, could be incorporated into science\neducation in schools and universities to\nproduce a more relevant teaching prog ram me.

    "content": "15 March 1999 Sport 25\nLADIES HOCKEY\nIsts happy with win; 2nds with defeat\nIC Ladies I.. UCL...!\nWe came, we conquered. Big style.\nWe expected to win of course, but\nnot thanks to such quality goals by\nthe Hummingbird. Throughout the first\nhalf we kicked ass and were never out of their half. The passing was flu-ent, the co-ordination was fine, and we were obviously the superior side. The first goal came after a serious amount of pressure. Hummingbird captured the ball and after fiddling around a bit eventually decided to flick the ball into the corner in that cool\ncollected manner. Hurrah! The second goal came thick and fast when Hummingbird decided again to score after\ngiving the keeper the ball. Unfortunately the goalie couldn't keep her\nlegs closed and she was well and truly\nnutmeg ed. Half time came and went copious amounts of oranges were consumed and the warriors continued to teach UCLa tough lesson. As the warriors tired, the game became more open, but Hummingbird thought she would finish matters by scoring another 'quality' goal.S he meant to\nbobble it in really.\nThroughout the match everyone played superbly( because we're fab)\nand we were most pleased to come away with such an emphatic victory.\nThey were pissed off, but we didn't care. So what if we weighed more than them! IC Ladies II..\nUCL\nThe ladies 2 nd learn finished the season in style, with Warwick scoring our\nsecond goal of the season. Admittedly, the opposition scored seven, but we don't let these minor details\ndisturb us. We had the largest turnout ever, with16 women( none of whom could play hockey). But to the resounding cheers of the men's Ists, we sur-passed all previous games by getting the ball out of our half. The forward line finally shone and gave their goalie\nsome grief - we were unlucky not to score more. UC? IC. I see. We're all right.\nHOCKEY - DISCO SQUAD VICTORIOUS AGAIN\nDisco Squad 6\nSt. Georges II 0\nWith the final of the U LUC up looming, this match was never going be more than a warm-up for the big day. It was played out on the same pitch that will\nsee us crush the St Mary's scum into\ndust, scattering them in Filtrum's ring-wind. Only fate knows where this torrid breeze of final judgement will take\nour vanquished foes, but such is the destiny awaiting those foolish enough to challenge the Disco Squad. On to the match. Cocky pre-match\nbanter involved score lines well into\ndouble figures, and although our domination of the match did not quite reach those heights, wc still kicked ass grand io so style. The first half saw five strikes hit the back of the St\nGeorge's net, a hat-trick and two goals\ncoming from The Sundance Kid and Fabio respectively. This midway score line was even more remarkable considering that Fulltum defected to St\nGeorge's for the entire half. Our first\ngoal was scored by The Sundance Kid. Slipping round the opposition like\nsome trout on speed, he skinned four\ndefenders before sliding the ball from a tight angle inside the near post, past\nthe sprawling St George's keeper. The\nfourth goal was Fabio's second, and it\nwas a beau t.He flicked the ball with\na reverse-stick from the top of the D, over the keeper and into the top left\nhand corner of the George's goal. It\nwas inspired. The second half was a pretty\nrelaxed affair, what with the50 score\nand all. Viagra the keeper kindly got\na brew going, and our defence settled\ndown for a nice cup pa. Meanwhile, Fabio got carded for dismembering one of the opposition, and Indian Carpet Catalogue scored. Fabio's pleas\nthat he didn't realise that such behaviour has been illegal since'97 fell on deaf ears. Joker gave him a big grin\nand sent him off. The goal was a cush ty little number, finished with a reverse stick flick over the keeper's legs into the back of the net. Nice. And so the Disco Boys continue their triumphant run. Although some of us maybe starting to feel some nerves about the upcoming showdown, we know in our heart-of-hearts\nthat there is only going to be one wi nner on Saturday. The one and only,\nthe disco boys! We're going all the\nway! Nice...\n'A \"Touch of Ciass'\ni vnv w.su Jc^ aGo k/ summer bal hii*_ Lonsborough <\nJ( pom/ Me^an cfr a< Pafa.ce\n\n"
