    "content": "2 FELIX VAC QUIRK An article on Vacation Work\nrecently appeared in our o on temporary THE TIMES. The opinions expressed\nwere, surprisingly enough, not those\nof students, hut of professors and\ntutors.\nIt is most revealing to find that\nwe do not apparently need the money we\nearn - we save up\"for a car, or a radio, or even a dinner jacket* according to a Yorkshire professor, who\nadded that most of us come \"from work-ing-class families where a lusty youngster was exp sots d to contribute something\nto the home . . . where in many oases\nbrothers and sisters had been doing so\nsince they were 15\". From Scotland we\nare told that we work \"for the prestige\"\nfrom Oxford \"undergraduates like tall stories to tell.\" Everyone agreed\nthat fina no e did not usually enter\ninto the matter but \" if you hunted,\naround you might find a hard case or\ntwo, especially among the older stu-dents.\"\nHow very naive! The maximum grant\nof a student ia of the order of \u00a3270\np.a. It is rather absurd to think\nthat this alone can suffice to maintain a student for a year, without recourse to earning.\n\"Some dons heartily disapprove (of\nvac. work).... arguing that if undergraduates stopped using the vacation\nfor serious study there must be a fall in standards\" and \"with a three year\ncourse...the heavy spade-work must be\ndone in vacation or not at all.\" On\nthe other hand one of our own tutors,\npresumably referring to approved vac.\nwork \"had a further idea: 'most of\nthe younger tutors here don't like to\nsee their students going off to work\nat all; there is a general feeling\nthat this is the time far that broader\neducation everybody says the technologist should havel\"\nAt last the power a that-be have\nseen a little light, and have come\nround to the inevitable - that in general I.C. is producing relatively\nnarrow-minded graduates. Agreed, the\nvac. is an excellent time to broaden\nour minds but working will not prevent this as long as the Job is considered as a means to an end, and not\nan end in itself. Many I.C. students\ntravel to Canada and Europe through\nMr. Newby's Offloe - this can surely\nhave no narrowing influence. Most\njobs, either directly or indirectly,\nafford the opportunity of increased\npersonal contact and travel, two\nessential prerequisites of a broad\nmind.\nFinally: \"The Association of\nuniversity Teachers decided cautiously\n(in 1956) that undergraduates should\nbe allowed to work, but not for too\nlong.\" So it looks as if we shall be\nfree . . . to peddle bathing beauty\ncontests, when we might be brushing\nup our Plato.\"\nR. F.K. DOWN THE WYE AND UP THE CREEK This Easter a party of about\ntwenty students,mainly from I.C. and\nBedford College, embarked on the 100\nmile canoe trip down the Wye from\nGlezbury to Tintern\", all but two\nfinished the course. Despite bitterly cold nights, leaking canoes and\nvery wet water, there were no regrets\nand true to their training the I.C. men found a camping site within a few minutes walk of a pub every evening.\nLIBRARIAN APPOINTED Mr. A.G.

C., he is a qualified librarian and\na man of very wide interests, one of\nhis hobbies being the dismemberment of\nold taxi-cabs.\nEUROPEAN UNION DEBATED\nThe Union Debate Was held on\nMarch 11th with John Chadwiok in the\nchair. The motion was an elongated\nversion of \"That this House is in favour of Britain's participation in a European Economic Union.\" Mr.\nJohn Briggs-Daviea, M.P. spoke in favour, dwelling, chiefly On the\nnecessity of using the European\na ark et if our industries are to survive.\nHe was ap posed by Mr. Martin Madden\nM.F. who feared that Britain might lose\nmuch of her independence under such a scheme. Of the seconding speakers Mr.\nRobert Finch impressed particularly\nby his obvious sincerity and good\ncommand of the problem.\nThe floor speeches showed that\nmoat I.C. men have not really the\nsped si 1 sod-knowledge for this kind\nof motion and only Mr. David Stevens,\nspeaking against the motion, and emphasizing the direct threat to Britain's livelihood from the rapidly developing German industries, suggested that\nthere was anything left to say after\nthe paper speeches were over. The\nHouse divided, and the motion was\ncarried by a small majority.\nP.K.

    "content": "FELIX5 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nCULTURE\nDear Sir, II hope your editorial of last ~\ntenn falls on fertile ground, together with Tony Hodgson's inspired\n3u u porting viewpoint in the following\ni33 ue. for too long now, the problem\nof producing cultured and responsible\nstudents has been hedged around by\nsuch questions as: Do the narrow-minded scientist? need better Union\nfacilities? Or bigger halls of residence? Or more General Studies\nlecture3? Of course we need these things,\nbut let us keep our sense of proportion.\nAn average student spends le3s than a quarter of his time in Union act iv i ties. Living in a purely internal\nhall at an all-science college like\nI.C, is hardly going to help students\nadjust to society in general. And\nGeneral Studies lectures still bear\nfor most, however deplorably, the\nstigma of being either, 'potted' or\ntri rj: upon them.\nMost of a student'3 active life( for good or ill) is spent in study.\nObviously, it is academically that the\nstudent must be reached by the arm of\n'culture'. How can this be done? Kow\ncan we acquire a3 ense of vocation, a feeling of responsibility - things\nw n ich storm from a real and fundamental S respect for our subjects? Not by the\npresent method of ten lectures a week,\nthen go home and read it up.' Or fr cm the idea that science is a set of facts\nalone, which must be temporarily absorbed and then unburdened in the next\nexaminations.\nWhat is required, first and fore-most, is decent teaching, not lectures\nby cast-off researchers copied hurriedly out of text-books. We nav- enough\nspecialist research workers on the\nstaff. Why not a few specialist\nteachers? They could give all but the\nmost advanced courses, and they would\nbo chosen for their enthusiasm and\nhumanity. Human inspiration is the\nstuff of life, science included. No\namount of impersonal talk can replace\nthe influence of the natural teacher,\nparticularly in the early years at\nCollege.\nIn this way proper unity could\nbe given to the present sets of dis-jointed, unrelated courses. And in\nthis way, methods of thought may be\nstressed, instead of facts alone\nbeing rammed down our throats.\nAs support for such lecture-room improvements, there should be a much enlarged tutorial system, and\nperhaps also junior colloquia for\nvigorous discussions amongst under-graduates. All the staff, professors\nincluded, should give tutorials, while\na student should have more than one\ntutor, and more tutorials than the\npresent quota of one shared hour every\nweek or two. Only through constant\npersonal contacts can students get an\nimpression of the real nature of scientific thought and research, and only by\nfirst-class teaching can they develop\nany sort cf maturity.\nIt is from this maturity in our\ndaily thought and work, the closest end\nstrongest influence on us, that real\nculture can spring.\nLet us set this present state of\naffairs in order first, and worry about\nour recreation later. We'll even tackle\nthis much the better as a result.\nYours etc.,\n\u2022 B.M. Segal (physics Hi) Note: >\n(in the writer's experience his remarks\napply particularly little to the\nMathematics Department. )\nPLASTIC SANDWICHES\nDear Sir,\nI am amazed and appalled at the\ngross stupidity of whoever is responsible for installing the plastic-coated counter in the Sandwich Bar.\nSurely a purely passing observation\nof the conditions in that pigsty would\nshow that the money frittered away on\na powder-blue Formica top could be much\nbetter spent.\nWhy is there no room to eat in\ncomfort? Why do we have those bulky\nmoth-eaten sofas, Union rejects? Why\nare there no plates, no glasses for\nmilk, no milk boiler? Furthermore,\nthe cafeteria atmosphere induced detracts considerably from the usefulness of the room for other functions.\nDo not imagine that we are ungrateful for having money spent on U3,\nbut we are not impressed by pretty\ncolours and fancy woodwork.\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\nSandwich.\n'<ot Lord Sandwich.\nUNSUPPORTED\nDear Sir,\nOnce again the I.C. Dramatic\nSociety has given us an entertaining\nplay, well anted and produced with\nconsiderable skill, and providing a very pleasant evening's entertainment.\nBut once again, on Tuesday evening,\nthe House was less than a quarter full, which is extremely poor reward for the\nhard work put in by both the actors\nand production staff: not only is a full house essential to create the\nbest atmosphere for a comedy, but it also helps the actors to become more\nconfident in their parts.\nIf more members of I.C. would\ntake the opportunity to 3ee one of\nthese productions, they would be\nassured of full value for their money\nand would help to make the effort of\nthe Sooiety more worth while, and they\nmight even be tempted to go again in the future.\nYours faithfully,\nP.J. Crabtree.\nEditor's notes\nThis agonising plea for bigger\naudiences for the Dra-a. Soc. has become a biannual institution at I.C. It is about time that the Society\nstepped moaning and asked itself why\nit happens to them and not to the\nMusical Society, for example.\nNow, the Musical Society's activities are a part of daily College life for many people. The lunch\ntime concerts, record recitals and\nlectures keep people, including non-performers, interested and sympathetic.\nThe Dramatic Society on the other hand\nproduces its two plays a year in\na manner reminiscent of a chicken laying an egg, only an occasional gallery\nparty relieving the intervening tedium._\nThere are many more things that\nthe Dram, Soc. could do to attract\ninterest and support. A well known\nauthor, actor or producer, for ex-ample, would be a great draw for a lecture or demonstration of his art.\nAgain before the performance of a play\nthe author might be induced to come\nand talk about it. Long-playing\nrecords of plays by Shakespeare and\nothers, new techniques in writing and\nperforming plays - all these afford\nscope for original and enterprising\nideas, and it is about time that\nadvantage was taken of them.\nSENIOR COMMON ROOM\nIDear Sir,\n^ Hon much longer are the members\nof the Union going to stagnate in their\napathetic stupor and allow a gross miscarriage of bureaucracy to continue in\nthe building designed for their own\nconvenience? I refer to the fatuous\nsituation that is now present in the\nSenior Common Room. How much longer\nare we to let a small group of coffee\ndrinking, cheaply fed, inhospitable\nSenior Cotnnon Poom members monopolize\na room whose importance in the Union\nbuilding needs no explanation?\nNegotiations recommended by the\nUnion last year appear to have reached\na deadlock through the inflexibility\nof the Senior Common Room in their\nendeavour to segregate themselves from\nthe student body even though there are,\nas we all know, more lounges for the\nstaff members only than for the two\nthousand or so students.\nIt recently happened that a group\nof students was unable to watch the televised F.A. Cup semi-final replay, in\nthe Reading Room. Naturally assuming\nthat the staff are human, and reciprocate the tolerance shown by students\nto them, they went into the S. C.R. to\nwatch there. However this so provoked\nand enraged a member of the S. C.R. as\nto demand if all were Union members\nand to go so far, quite beyond his\nrights which appeared incidental, as\nto ask far Union cards.\nAssuming that originally the\nhope was to encourage free contact\nwith student and staff, as was Hall\nDinner, then it has failed miserably.\nOnly if we see the S. C.R. as a convenient coffee lounge near cheap food\nfor S. C.R. members, a facility which\nis not available to the students who\nare without doubt of prime importance\nin that building, is it a success.\nIf the members of staff who use\nthe Union building want to be apart\nfrom the students let them go elsewhere;\nthe Dining Hall is pleasant enough,\nthe students give the place atmosphere ,\nwhich impresses visitors, but we are\nnot az oc, we are not a showpiece, we\nare a living organism that must be\noperated efficiently and so o an not afford luxuries such as the S. C.R. By all mean3 let us have members of\nstaff to dine, wine, lunch and munch\nbut not to slink off and drink in isolation.\nYours, Benediotus Benedioat.\nNUCLEAR DISARMAMENT\nDear Sir,\nAt last iI. C. has its own Committee far Nuclear Disarmairent - a matter\nwhich is surely the particular concern\nof I.C. students since 30 many of us\nwill eventually help to produce nuclear\narms. The committee has the support\nof people with widely differing religious and political views.\nA meeting is to be organized for\nthe evening of the 8th May when several\nprominent speakers will propose the\ncase. On the 20th May, a delegation\nwill be sent to the National Peace\nLobby at the House of Commons where it is hoped a large contingent will represent I.C. If you are dissatisfied with the\npresent trends in Nuclear Policy, you\nare invited to get in touch with any\nof the signatories below, and lend us\nyour support.\nYours sincerely,\nD. Finney (Sec. ) S. Lenssen\nL. Allen J. Lucioli\nJ.D. Cole Judy Lemon\nE Jarraan J. Piatt\nA. Hodgson P. Porgesp\n\n"

    "content": "4 FELIX EDITOR :\nPETER LEVIN\nCIRculction\nI500\nIS MARRIAGE REALLY NECESSARY? Earlier this year Professor Ubbelohde of the Chemical Engineering Department,\nwho is a member of the Council of R.C.A. and a collector of paintings and ob jets d 'art, read to the Royal Society of Arts a paper on \"The Marriage of Art and Science.\"\nUnlike most would-be mind-broaden ers he made out a convincing case for such a union.\nDescribing artistic urge as a creative human reaction to experience, he pointed out\nthat while technological progress had greatly amplified the range of human experience,\nthe reaction of art was towards un intelligibility and the abstract. Art thus provided no fundamental safeguard against the pressing claims of applied science,\nwhich consequently became more and .lore starkly functional.\nEvery work of man has a social influence. A building replaced the \"natural\ninheritance of skyline, light and horizon, wind and weather, by a man-made artefact,\nwhich generated new aesthetic experiences\", and there could be no question that such\nexperiences 3hould be made generally ^leasing and elevating. Moreover, the inside\nlayout could impose on its users a sense of frustration and hurry, or a sense of\nefficient living. Responsibility for the forming of \"pleasing patterns or dull\ntrivialities in tue space-time curves of individuals in a building\" was not to be\nevaded by any \"servile flight into 3t ark functionalism.\"\nThe crux of t. iis argument is clear. The applied scientist will not fulfil the social requirements of his construction without some access to artistic creation\nwhile an artist will miss much contemporary opportunity without some access to\napplied science. These are the educational demands on the union between art and\nscience and these are the reasons why General Studies and Touchstone are a vital\npart of our education at I.C. FOOD IS NO SUBSTITUTE Taking with a pinch of salt press releases from the College that unctuously\nrefer to the General Studies lectures as a \"bridge between different domains of\nlearning and interest,\" we should be grateful that one of our professors seems to\nunderstand the reason for their importance. Unfortunately, on being asked \"nhat\nthe Imperial College is doing to enable a rather homogeneous collection of scientists\nto become acquainted with the Arts,\" Professor Ubbelohde could only plead that it was \"difficult for me to reply oo gently to that question, apart from quoting St.\nPaul about the leaven in the lump.\" It emerged, however, that he is promoting a dining club to cement the marriage between the artists of the R.C.A. and the scientists of I.C. This is quite a bright idea and we may hope that something will come\nof it. But we cannot all discharge our responsibilities by joining a dining club.\nI.CY. HOLIDAY The newly formed cycling group of\nthe I.C.Y. H.A. made a six day tour of\nthe Lake District during the Easter\nVacation,meeting at the Crossthwaite\nHostel, wh i oh was both readily accessible and a suitable starting point.\nOn the first day some rain occurred\nat Bowness, but by the time that\nEsthwaite Water was reached, sufficient sun 3hone to make a very\npicturesque scene.\nThe next day Walna Scar and Hardknott passes were climbed, the former\nproving rather more difficult than was\nexpected, and a joint I.C./ Bedford\nparty on a walking holiday was joined\nat Eskdale Y. H. Two of the more energetic cyclists decided, amidst much scorn\nto go 'over the tops' to Buttermere;\nunperturbed, they made this journey\nover Wasdale Head and Elacksail Pass,\narriving in pouring rain at the Buttermere Hostel,where they were met by the\nothers who had gone the longer and less\nmountainous way. Rain continued all the next day, which rather spoilt the\nlong and interesting climb up Honister.\nA clay pigeon shoot provoked much\ninterest in the afternoon and several\nmembers attempted to take se me photo-graphs.\nAfter staying the night in Keswick,\na Southwards course was set, amidst\npicture postcard scenery, for Grassmere.\nAttempts to find the Hostel nearby\nended with lost trails in a thick wood\nnear Langdale; this penultimate night\nwa3 spent with the hiking party. On\nthe last stage over Kirkstone to\nPOINTS FROM COUNCIL Apart from the reports from representatives on coi mitte es, the agenda\nof the last Council meeting wa3 quite\nshort. There were two announcements -John Bell has taken over the Chairmanship of S. C.C., Tony Hodgson having\nretired for health reasons, and the\nproposed Easter conference was cancel-led, due to the examination com r. iit-ment s at this season of Continental\nUniversities.\nThe question of carnival damage\nwas raided as a result of \u00a330 worth\ninflicted upon the front of the stage\nduring the R.C.S. Carnival. It will\nbe recalled that the Eastern staircase\nwas damaged by the headlong descent of\nthe bath used in the Guilds Carnival\ncabaret. It wa3 felt that organisers\nshould pay, as a matter of principle,\nfor damage caused at or resulting\nfrom such functions.\nNEW - CHEM. ENG. SOC. TIE - NEW\nON SALE IN BOOK STALL\nSILK & RAYON IhJ-, SILK \u00a31.\nUllswater and ?en ri th, the only untoward incident occurred when one\nmember decided to argue with the\ndusty road; fortunately, he sustained\nlittle serious damage. After spending\nthe night at Garsdale Head Hostel,\nvoted the best of the trip, the party\nsplit and went its several ways.\nOH WOE! At the end of last term the\nDramatic Society Easter production\nof \"Misery Me\" by Dennis Cannan was\nseen by those members of the College,\napparently few in number, who were\ninterested enough to investigate the\nwork of a College Society other than\ntheir own. Finance can be no excuse\n- one can attend for as little as l/6d. Although this was not the Society's main production for the year, those\nwho did not go missed a pleasant even-ing'3 entertainment even if it was\nnot of the high standard which the\nDramatic Society can^and do spas-modi call y, reach.\nIf one member of the cast was\naccidentally omitted from the programme until the last minute t is\nmay have been due to his in audibility which made him lose character at times.\nUnsuspected talent was revealed by\nJanet Stevens who gave a very sincere\nand sensitive interpretation of the\nleading role; this i3 especially\ncreditable for, although in her\nthird year, it i3 the first time Janet\nhas set foot on a3t age as an actress.\nJake Spence gave the confident and\ngenuine performance which we have\ncome to expect of him; while Derek\nBayliss, a new-comer, gave ample\nproof of his previous acting experience and will be a great asset\nto the Society in the future. Sheila\nBurbage obviously enjoyed her part\nalthough it did not greatly tax her\nability.\nIt was most unfortunate that the\nproducer also chose to act.\nThe set was good, i fret her insecure in moments of great crisis;\nindeed the strength of one actor\nproved too much for it. It was well-designed, creating an illusion of space\nand demonstrated technical ingenuity\nif lack of artistic imagination. In\nspite of the fact that three people\nwere in charge of publicity there was\nnot overmuch advertising, nor was it much in advance of the first night -although one is given to understand\nthat this was not entirely their\nfault. Let us hope that this alone\nwas the reason for lack of support\nfrom the College as no actor can perform well without the sym pa the tio cooperation of an adequate audience.\nNOT GOODENOUGH?\nSir,\nTouched by an example of manners\nbad even by the standards of Imperial\nCollege, displayed in the recent examination of membership cards, I wish\nto question the present system of involuntary membership of t he Union.\nSince I first came to the Imperial\nCollege I have paid about \u00a320 in tl ni on subscriptions. These have en ab:1 me\nto mix socially with people I have no\nwish to know, and have assisted a few\nstudents to hold Union offices and, as\nthe number of bogus accents 3how s, to\nbecome conscious of their social and\nmoral inferiority.\nI su-^e3t that we either adopt the\nOxbridge system of selective member-ship, or or ovid e the alternative of an\nUpper and a Lower (Riijht or Left, if that is preferred) Union. Naturally,\nbut unfortunately, the Upper Union\nsubscription would nave to be considerably the higher.\nThe latter system would enable\nthe more civilised section of the\npresent Union to avoid being annoyed\nby the more brutal.\nYours faithfully,\nK.F. Goodenough.\n\n"

Union o hose Speaker's Corner for it3 meeting at lunchtime\non Wednesday, and the auspicious\ngathering of some 200 scientists was\nrapidly reinforced by interested members of the public. After the meeting Jezebel went off to Grosvenor\nSquare to meet Clementine and Bo,and\nat 2.45 the three vehicles set off for\nPiconAilly via Oxford Street and Regent Street, Clem going ahead at a great rate, having not too much steam\nand wishing to get as far as possible\nwhile it lasted. Jezebel and Bo fol lowed with a corte ge of fancily dressed attendants handing out Carnival\nleaflets.\n\"On the afternoon of 29th. April,\nI was proceeding along Regent Street\nwhen I perceived a Bl..dy Great Steam\nRoller a'u rtl in gm my direction.\"\nIt was at this point that Fate, in the\nshape of a big blue Inspector of Police,\ntook a hand. Clem was ordered down a side street and the drivers told that\nthey would be charged for using a vehicle \"wholly for the purpose of advertising.\" Clem was carrying a small\nposter on her boiler door.\nChad and Graham King, Presidentelect of Mines, went to Savile Row\nPolice Station and were told that\nClem would be reported. Apparently\nfancy-dress processions for advertising purposes are illegal \u2014 only\nsandwich-board men thirty yards apart\nmay be employed.\nMeanwhile a large crowd of students had assembled around Eros, with\nmany members of the public looking on.\nAt the stroke of three Jezebel appeared and triumphant clanging acknowledged\nthe cheers of the throng as she circled\nEros and sailed away in the direction\nof Hyde Park Corner.\nBo now arrived, and a loud and enthusiastic Boomalaka rent the air. There were few policemen to be seen,\nbut they seemed quite interested and\ncarefully perused the leaflets handed\nto them.\nBack at the Union a Black Maria\nwas waiting. The occupants showed\ngreat interest in the vehicular display and urged it to depart with max-WIN A PROFESSOR Do you realise that for the meagre sura of One Pound from each student it would be possible to hold an Imperial College Sweepstake, the prize being one\nyear's individual tuition from the professor of the winner's choice? This is, of course, rather far-fetched. Even so, it seems that measures nearly as extreme may be needed before long. Judging from letters received by FELIX, discussions heard around College and remarks made by members of staff, there are\nsome who feel very strongly that the education offered by thi3 College is not\nall it should be. Dr. Hopkins of the Physics department asserts that \"there\nare many teachers who would find that, could they be compelled to listen to\ntheir own lectures, they would not understand them.\" Dr. Weale even goes so\nfar as to suggest in the Phoenix that lectures might be scrapped completely.\nSo far, of course, it is the vociferous minority that has had its say.\nBut what is your opinion? In an effort to gain a more representative selection of views, you are urged to fill in the questionnaire inside. You need\nnot give a straight Yes or No, and relevant comments are welcome. Your name\nis not needed. Just leave the completed questionnaire in one of the collecting boxes or in the Union Office, not later than May 14th.i mum haste. A few minutes later an\nInspector arrived \u2014 he had heard\nabout the procession on his radio and\nhad come along to join in the fun,\nsuspecting that those outside were\nfrom another college and trying to\ngain admission. He too was handed\na leaflet: there ought to be quite\na sprinkling of the gendarme rie at\nBedford on Saturday.\nPYJAMA PARTY\nIn the evening a seventy-strong\npy jama party, in luxuriant night\nattire, began their gay publicity\nstunt from S. Kensington; to the\naccompaniment of hot rhythm and\nhectic jiving ( station masters and reporters getting hep ) the\nparty deviously reached Blackfriars,\nand thence proceeded to Fleet Street.\nHere the law appeared gaily\nwhistling, attracting passionate\nblown kisses from passing nightshirts.\nOn to Trafalgar Square, humming patriotic airs, and provoking considerable\npublic interest. Here the skiffle\ngroup provided mu sio for jiving in a wonderful setting of floodlit fountains \u2014 onlookers joining in.\nBut the law at last politely but\nfirmly intervened, informing the party\nthat they were contravening the \"Sess-ional law\", as Parliament was then\nsitting. The procession was forcibly\ndispersed by 'A' Division but had soon\nre-formed, and disappeared into the\ndepths of Green Park Station. The revellers returned,as they went,to the\nsound of strumming guitars.\nSPORTS DAY Coach tickets ( 2/-) from Bookstall\nBuffet\nMAY I4th.\nBar\nWHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT In spite of grumbling when money\nis short, I suppose all of us realize\nto a great extent how lucky we are to\nbe students in this country. We also\nhave some idea of the hardships and\ndifficulties that many overseas students\nface in their quest for learning, but\nvery rarely do we have the chance to\nhelp these people, to supply money for\ndrugs, medicine, book3, equipment.\nTomorrow, however, the opportunity\ndoes arise, for the World University\nService, with the help of most London\nColleges, including I.e., is holding\na Carnival in the grounds of Bedford\nCollege, Regent's Park. All that is required is for you to come and enjoy\nyourself. There will be a Barbecue\nTea, Jiving, Jazz Band and Skiffle\nGroup Contests, West Indian Steel Bands,\nJudo and fencing Displays, and a Beer\nDrinking competition, as well as a host\nof other amusements. Chad will also be\npresent sitting in a special chair suspended above a tank of water, so if you have a secret longing to dunk the\nPresident, here is a splendid opportunity. The Carnival is from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., and is followed by a dance\nat I.C., in aid of W.U. S. "

    "content": "TOUCHSTONE\nFELIX FREEDOM AND SECURITY The guest speaker on this occasion\nwaa Maurice Cranston, a frequent contributor to the MANCHESTER GUARDIAH and\nap rise winning biographer. The inclusion of two guests from L.S.E. was\na further guarantee of an interesting\nweekend \u2014 if such a guarantee he need-ed.\nMr. Cranston discussed three basic\nproblems - political, social and economic. Mill pointed out in the 19th Century that in addition freedom from\nState intervention, one needed freedom\nfrom social conformation and from the\npressure of public opinion up to the\npoint where one is interfering with the\nfreedom of others. Thirdly economic\nfreedom was required, for in Victorian\nThe last Carnival of the year,\n\u2022Kimono My House\" by R.C.S., was rather\ndisappointing. It started promisingly\nenough and went with a swing until the\ncabaret. The ensuing chaos was mainly\ndue to the presence of drunken insurgents\nfrom the Rugger Club, presumably still celebrating their victory over Kings,\nand the positioning of the bar on the\nstage did not help matters. The cabaret\nwas potentially quite promising but,\ndue to obvious lack of rehearsal, did\nnot come over at all well. It opened\nwith an epic of the Wild Hast: Wynot\nBurp in \"That's Rioe in them thar hills\" the story of how a one rickshaw town,\ntransformed into a bad city overnight\nby a rich strike nearby, was cleaned\nup by the hard hitting sheriff Wynot\nBurp.\nThe next turn was a Chinese\ndefective story entitled \"The Case of\nthe missing Chopstick\", wh i oh went\ncompletely astray, and was mercilessly\nbar racked by an impatient audience.\nAfter an u necessarily long inter-val, due to the microphones being\nbroken by drunks, the band started\nplaying until the early hours of the\nmorning; but the music they produced\nwas very disjointed, with long gaps\nbetween the numbers totally spoiling\nthe atmosphere; as one girl put it \"Just as you get in the mood, the\nby band stops.\" The I.C. Jazs\nBand, wh i oh had been playing upstairs,\ntook over at about five o 'clock,con-tin u ing in til all the weary bodies\nhad retired to bed.\nH.P. K. GUILDSMANS EYE VIEW\nCarnival cabarets are never bless e with good behaviour, and regular interjections from the revellers are usual.\nHowever R.C.3., in addition, had to\nsuffer attacks from their rear flanks.\nAt times it seemed that everything\nwould end in disorder, at one stage\nthe lighting gallery was be sei ged by\ntwo drunken rug ger players, however,\nthe programme was in the main completed\nand thanks are due to the bar staff\nfar rt/rr ting an ugly situation.\nDaring a back-stage fracas, a group of\ndrunks assailed the bar stocks,\nhelping themselves to beer and other\ndrinks, including a half bottle of\nwhisky. It is no wonder that the\nbar made a loss when suo h behaviour\nwas taking place. The shams is even\nworse when one considers that a member of Union Council was standing\ntalking to the nia ore ants. Footnote: The whisky was paid for\nlater when the thief had sobered up,\nother than that, none of the other\ndrinks were paid for.\nJ. K.T. gnp/i* nA domestic servants and others\nwere in Marx's words 'wags slaves'.\nThe only answer was socialism with\nthe degree of security and economic\nfreedom balanced against a loss of\npolitical freedom. More controversial was the teaching of Rousseau\nwho considered that the freedom to de\nwhat one should do mas all-important.\nThe speaker further pointed out it is probably an Anglo-Saxon illusion that\nall people want freedom.\nOn the sub j eot of democracy' Mr\nCranston questioned whether the\n\"Peoples' Democracies\" or the Western\ndemocracies are a good approximation\nto true government by the people.\nDemocracy cannot be government by the\nmajority as this tends to neglect\nminority interests, whether the minority be religious, social or economic.\nHe believed that the essence of democracy lay in the interplay of ideas in\nfree discussion. However, when this\npoint was considered along with censorship and other questions in the later\ndiscussion, many believed that the\nfreedom tc change the government occasionally is, after all, the best\nsafeguard of democracy.\nHOSTEL RENTS GO UP\nNext session will see an increase\nin the rent of most rooms in the Old,\nNew and Garden Hostels. An extra \u00a31\na term is to be charged, raising the\nrent of a room in the New Hostel, for\nexample, from \u00a319.10.0 to \u00a320.10.0\nfor the Autumn and Spring Terms, and\nfrom \u00a318.0.0 to \u00a319.0.0 for the\nSummer Term. Vacation rents and charges\nfor visitors will also go up, but there\nwill be no change in the rents of the\nshared rooms in the Garden Hostel.\nThe reason for the increased\ncharges is the oost of the recent re-decoration of the Hostels, and the fact\nthat much of the bed linen will shortly\nneed replacing, to say nothing of some\nwell-known beds.\nc Is \u00a3\nVh if N \u2022 7\nON1 qH r7301030 CONCERT\nHALL\nWBWTS C0IM CONGRATULATIONS on their recent\nmarriages to John Hobson, of\nGuilds Entertainments Cttee.,\nand Peter Jarman, short story\nwriter.\nNELSON hears that the authorities at Les Angeles City College\nand at Michigan State University,\nboth co-educational establish-ment s, have stopped girl students\nfrom attending classes in shorts.\nThey said it was \"too distract-ing.\" Lecturers should learn to\no on tro l themselves.\nA suggestion for Hr.m boney.

Changes have also been made in the\nVictorian statuary adorning the centre\nflower bed.

Many of the newcomers were of\nquite high stand r rd, making team selection a difficult task.\nThe season opened successfully\nfor the l st XI who beat \"Hye College by\nnine wickets, on a difficult r>ito h. One of the most pleasing features was\nthe fielding of the I.C. ter jn, which\nwas a vast improvement over last year.\nThe trip to Wye was an outstanding\nsuccess, due in part to the fact that\nthe team were accompanied by the I.

This was the downfall of\nmany crews, including the I.C.2 nd VIII, who were only a few seconds\n3lower than I.C.l st VIII at Hammersmith but ended up some 50 places lower.\nThe I.C.l st VIII did very well\nto move up from l6 th to 12th place.\nThey caught the crew in front near\nChiswick Syot but that crew would not\nmove over to allow the I.C. boat to\npass (as is the rule in rowing) and the\nI.C. boat was forced to go wide out\nof the stream, thus losing valuable\nseconds.\nDue mainly to increased opposition the only other I.C. crew to better\nits position was the 6th VIII, composed of fresher s with some previous\nrowing experience, who moved up about\n30 place J from l& Vth.\nHowever, all the I.C. crews enjoyed\ntheir Head Night Dinner.

    "content": "FELIX7 The Musical Society sprang into\nthe public ear towards the end of\nlast tern with two presentations -a performance of Bach's Mass in B Minor by the College Choir, followed\na week later by Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Mikado.1\n'\nBoth the Mass and the Savoy Opera\ndrew full houses, the latter for four\nnights running, enhancing the already\nconsiderable reputation of the Society.\nTo quote THE TIMES;\n\"It is the aim of the conductors\nof most university choirs that\nevery student-member should sing\nBach'sB Minor Mass during his or\nher university career. Many of\nthose taking part in the performance\nby the Imperial College Choir on\nWednesday evening must have been\nsinging this work for the first time,\nand it is greatly to the credit of\ntheir conductor, Dr. Eric Brown,\nthat they sang with sureness and\nconviction. Responding well to a clear and steady beat, with perfect\nintonation throughout, they produced some exciting moments, but\nwere not yet able to sustain this\nexcitement.\"\nThe singing in \"The Mikado\" too\nwas of a high standard, and under the\nexpert direction of Mr. Prank Kennard\nthe hardworking oas t gave a very\nspirited performance. Stafford Dean,\nas the Mikado, and Michael Amos, as\nKo-Ko, were outstanding \u2022 However, a little more care could have been taken\nwith the props. The backed.o th was\nthat used for the Guilds carnival, and\nshowed it, while reflection from the\nsell ota po holding Katisha's fan together was no less obvious.\nThese su coe s s ful productions of\nthe Musical Society underline once\nagain the strong musical tradition of\n+he Colletre. Incidentally, it is a fact that performers queue up to give\nlunch-hour c once ts at I.C., appreciating the \"civilised audience and atmosphere,\" before going on to broadcasts.\nI.C. occupies an accepted niche in\nLondon's musical world and it is obviously vital to maintain our musical\nfacilities. It is to be hoped that\nduring the expansion of the College\nand after, these facilities will be\ncarefully safeguarded.\nHOCKEY CLUB IN HOLLAND Prom the day we arrived in Groningen\nthis tour had the promise of success.\nWe arrived during a snowstorm but the\nweather quickly changed, giving us fine\nsunny days for the rest of the tour,\nenabling us to complete all our fix-ture s. However, these were of minor import-ance, sines the main purpose of the\ntour was to meet Dutch students, to\nlearn their ways, sad to teach them a few Old English customs. We were\nfortunate in that there were no language dl ff leni ties, our hosts being\neager to practise their English\nIn Groningen our hosts were the members of Forward Hookey Club, a student\nsociety of the Univ. of Groningen. The\nhighlight of our stay was a feast, in eel eb ration of Forward winning the\nForth Netherlands Hookey Tournament.\nAs at all other feasts, our team displayed great ability in the art of\nalcoholic im bibi tion. Two matches were played in Groningen.\nThe first, against Groningen Catholic\nStudents, was drawn 1 - 1; our goal,\nthe first of the tour, was appropriately\nscored by the Captain, H.G. King. The\nsecond match, against Forward, was also\na draw 1 - 1 (so or erR. Lee).

We won our seo tion, but we\nretired to let the runners-up play in the final, wh i oh they won. Our thanks\nare due to the Dutch Universities\nAthletio Association for allowing us\nto play and for entertaining us after-wards.\nAnd so to Delft, famous for Delft\nBlue China and for Engineers (6000 of\nthem), which is a typical University\ntown and is an ideal touring centre.\nHere we played our hardest gam s when\nwe drew 2 - 2 with Delft Studentum.\nThe Delft side contained one of their\ntwo internationals, and were favourites\nto win the Netherlands Club Championship. However, thanks to fine goals\nby Lee and Holmes and a splendid effort\nby the defence, we managed to maintain\nour unbeaten record.\nOur last game waa against Delft\nSanetus Yirglllus, in which the team\nrounded off a fine tour by winning\n6 - 1 .\nTour record:\nP81414L OF15 A5. From Delft we visited the Hague , and\nlater Amsterdam, where, with spokesman Bhatnagar persuading the proprietor\nto allow us a cheap rate, we toured the\nfamous canals by barge, seeing many\nplaces of repute.

King and Rees for\ntheir hard work in organisation.\nThis waa a fitting end to a most\nsuccessful season, in wh i oh the Club\nhas lost only 17 matches out of 55.\nWe have regularly turned out three\nteams, and with a little more support\nit should be possible to form a4 th. team.\nRecord for season:\nP WDL FAl st.
