    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday May 22nd19872 Gay one\nDear Dave,\nHaying:, read the last issue of\nFELIX, with its letters on the subject\nof gays by Andrew Thomis and Hugh\nMacKenzie, I would like to add my\nown comments on this issue.\nIt is a great pity that Mr Thomis\nwas unable to read the closing\nstatement of Hugh MacKenzie\"s letter\nbefore he decided to base his\nargument purely on the act of sex.\nAs Mr MacKenzie so correctly-stated, the issue should hinge on\n\"What is the right relationship\nbetween sex and love?\".\nI fail to see what is so \"unappealing\naesthetically' about two people, of\nany gender, \"making love\" but I do.\nhowever, find this of two people\n\"having sex\".\nIt should be realised that the most\nprecious gift anyone can give is that\nof their love. Bodies can be bought\nor sold but love can only be received\nor offered, and it is this\nincorruptibility which should be the\nbasis of our actions.\nIf we have, in the words of Mr\nThomis, \" A desire to extend an\nemotional relationship physically\" we\nshould be able to do so without\nvilli fi cation no matter what the sex or\nrace of our partner. To go on,\nhowever, as Mr Thomis does, to say\nthat the act of sex is the \"desire to\ndemonstrate your affection\" is very\nwrong for love does not need\ndemonstrating where it exists already.\nTherefore I see no need for Andrew\nBannister to say how much blood\nthere is about when he does it\n(FELIX, March 18th) just as I have\nno wish to hear about who does it with\nwho around College. It should be\naccepted that if two people love each\nother this is a beautiful thing. Still\nmore importantly we should see that\nyou can have love without sex and,\nperhaps unfortunately, you can have\nsex without love.\nYours sincerely,\nAlistair Goodall (Geology I) Gay two\nDear Dave,\nIn his letter to FELIX (Letters 15th May) the one thing that Andrew\nThomis seems to lose sight of is that\nwe are talking about fellow human\nbeings. This includes many of my\nfriends and probably many of his. The\nleast Mr Thomis can do is to face up\nto his prejudices rather than couching\nthem in mock, soci a logical and\nanthropological language.\nYours,\nChas Jackson\nGay three\nDear Dave.\nLast week's FELIX published two\nletters from people who had\nsomething to say about the issue of\nhomosexuality, which between them\nmanaged to raise some rather\ninteresting points. They were printed\nunder the respective headings of\n'Imperial Gay not Okay' and\n'Confusion and Corruption', and I will deal with them in that order.\nThe first came from Andrew\nThomis. who after some background\npreamble made the point that the\nfamily unit in all great societies has\nbeen a fact, and is a necessary cultural\nnorm. Sure. I agree with that, and\nwith Mr Thomis' assertion that such\na unit is needed for the development\nof our children, although I might be\na little less rigid than he is about the\ndefinition of a family unit.\nThis point, we were told, implied\nthat certain types of sexual behaviour\nare abhorrent; namely rape,\nin discriminant sexual intercourse,\nand\u2014wait for it\u2014homosexuality.\nWell, I must agree that I find rape\nhorrifying and inexcusable, and if I thought that Mr Thomis was\nsuggesting I wanted to make it\nacceptable I would be furious.. .but he\nisn't, is he?\nIndiscriminate sexual intercourse,\nin my view, doesn't do anyone any\ngood, mostly because I suspect that\nit leads to emotional damage, but also\nin these troubled times it can be\ndangerous.\nWhich brings us to homosexuality.\nMr Thomis describes this as a socially\nuseless, even damaging activity, and\none which is aesthetically\nunappealing. Well, I obviously have\nto leave that last bit to personal\nopinion, although I might add that if\nyou think about it, just about any\nconceivable sexual act, heterosexual\nor otherwise, if viewed in the cold\nlight of day is pretty bloody\nunappealing anyway. But socially\nuseless and damaging? I can't agree.\nAny act of physical love emphasising the i ove '\u2014should be a fulfilling and heart-warming\nexperience, which apart from\nbringing the two people involved\ncloser together, will also help them\nto relate better to those around them:\nAnyone who is glowing happily this\nmorning will know what I mean. As\na cynical addition, I might say that\nhomosexual acts create no battered or\nabandoned babies, and do not add to\nthe world population problem.\nAs a final rejoinder to Mr Thomis,\nI suggest that before he makes\nremarks about pointless hedonism and\na desire to be penetrated yourself, he\nshould make sure he knows what he\nis talking about! I don't go round\nmaking ignorant remarks about the\nhedonism of man penetrating woman,\nso give me the same consideration.\nAnd now. taking a deep breath, I turn\nto the second letter, written by Hugh\nMcKenzie. who asks what is the right\nrelationship between sex and love? If\nyou ask that sort of question in a lecture, the prof coughs and says:\n\"I'm glad you asked me that...\"\nIn other words. I'm not sure. I don't think there can be just one right\nrelationship, but I believe that love is\nthe most important aspect, without\nwhich sex in itself is more or less\nworthless, a mere scratching of a physical itch. If sex is part of a loving\nrelationship, it can help to bring a couple closer together in a very\nwonderful way. I reckon that's about\nall I'm qualified to say on that subject.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Bannister, Gay and\nLesbian Welfare Officer\nGay four\nDear Dave,\nUnfortunately I feel obliged to add\na section of comment to the debate\nabout the Gay and Lesbian Welfare\nOfficer. Since my election, I have\nbeen informed by many people that\nthey expect me to fold the Gay Society\nand remove the G/L Welfare Officer\nfrom Council.\nI am sorry if my saying that I have\nabsolutely no intention of doing any\nsuch thing disappoints those people\nand friends who elected me, but\nunfortunately they disappoint me with\ntheir short sighted and narrow minded\nattitude; it was this kind of attitude\nthat necessitated the establishment of\nthese institutions to protect gay\npeople's rights.\nMore concerning is the fact that\nsome people have confided in me the\ninformation that others threaten\nphysical violence towards the high\nprofile members of this society.\nAlthough I stand by the ideals of\nmajority rule I will not stand for\nvictim is ation, violence or oppression.\nIn general people who demonstrate\nhatred or violence are merely showing\nthe symptoms of fear or paranoia.\nThere is no reason to fear gay people;\nthey are extremely unlikely to want\nto harm or h arras s anyone. In fact all\nthose I have met are exceedingly\nfriendly and reasonable. At the same\ntime I can assure the reader that they\nare far more worried about AIDS than\nyou ever will be.\nIt is all very well everyone\ndiscussing the rights and wrongs of\nthe matter of homosexuality through\nthe FELIX letters page. But how\nmany of these wise and wonderful\npeople have ever sat down face to face\nwith a gay person and discussed it\nwith him or her?\nAnyone ignorant enough to go out\n'queer bashing' obviously does not\nrealise that they are not at all likely\nto change the sexuality of a gay\nperson by the means of fear. For if\nthis was true, AIDS would have\nachieved this ages ago. All it would\ndo, would be to push them into\noppression and hiding and then no one\nwould know where they stood. There\nwould be far more success to be\ngained by beating me up, as it might\nscare me enough to stop me\nsupporting the rights of these\nintimidated individuals. Then again it\nmight make me all the more\ndetermined!\nThis whole issue does not just relate\nto gay people, but to all of the world's minorities who live in fear. As a note\nfor anyone who judges anyone on\nreligious grounds I would just like to\nsay, \"who are you to judge someone\nelse's servant? To his own master he\nstands or falls\" (Romans 14:4).\nFinally I must point out that it has\ncome to my attention that certain\npersons have been calling me a heteros exist. I have been trying to\nattain a clear definition of what this\nterm means and have found it to be\nimpossible. If as it appears, it means\nthat I prefer relationships with\nwomen, then too damned right I do!\nYours,\nIan Howgate\nManagers in\nclover\nDear Sir,\nShould student managers be paid\n\u00a3100 per hour? (per week, I think\u2014\nEd). This is currently the case in some\nImperial College\naccommodation...and the student\nresidents foot the bill.\nIn one particular head tenancy, the\nmanager and his wife enjoy a flat\nwhich would cost students over \u00a370\nper week (over \u00a33,600 pa) and have\nthis and their electricity and gas paid\nby the other residents. An apparent\nabuse of this latter privilege has meant\nthat the student manager's latest\nelectricity bill at approximately \u00a3270\nfor 15 weeks exceeded the sum of\ncosts attributable to all other 22\nresidents. In return the manager's duties occupy about 3\u20144 hours a month.\nI do not criticise this particular\nmanager, or others, for taking\nadvantage of the free accommodation\noffered\u2014who would not do so in their\nplace?\u2014and indeed in this case the\nmanager fulfils those duties expected\nof him adequately. It does, however,\nappear very irresponsible that the\ncurrent arrangements concerning\nmanagers' residence fees should stand\nas they are, especially when their\nincome is 3 or 4 times that of the\nstudents paying! As for students\npaying the manager's electricity, etc,\ndoubling their bills in some of the\nabove cases, clearly this would be\nhard to justify. The fact that students\ncontinued on page 4\n\n"

However,, opposition to the\nmerger was expressed by Professor\nSavers. Head of the Department of\nComputing and Dean of City &\nGuilds College. He said that the\nmerger would make Imperial a more\naverage institution, jeo pardi se its\nexisting links with the medical world\nand could lead to financial\nembarrassment for the College.\nProfessor Sayers added that he would\nprefer a form of association rather\nthan a merger with SMHMS, in such\na way that academic benefits could be\ngained without taking the risks\ninherent in amalgamation.\nRise and shine\nStudents in some departments may be\nfaced with lectures at 8.30am next\nOctober.

It is envisaged that\n8.30am to 9.30am lectures may be\nrequired to provide additional\nflexibility. These measures are being\nconsidered as a revision of a College\nPlan which was approved in 1985 for\na three year period.\nGross diplomacy; a letter from the President\nRe: Annual Report\u2014Iranian Students\nDear Dave,\nI have been approached by an\nIranian student who complained\nabout the comment in my annual\nreport regarding Iranian students\nfacing ' 'similar pressures'' to those\nexperienced by some Iraqi students at\nthe College. In retrospect I realise\nthat this may have been seen as an\nunfair generalisation and I am sorry\nif I have caused any offence to those\nconcerned. I shall attempt to explain\nsome of the background to my\ncomment.\nThroughout the year I have tried to\nsupport those Iraqi students at\nCollege who have been subject to any\nkind of interference from their\nGovernment with their activity and\nstudy in this country. My involvement\nwas in line with current IC Union\npolicy and at the request of a number\nof the students concerned. As I know\nlittle about the issues or organisations\ninvolved at the start of the year I checked through national media,\nAmnesty International, NUS and\nother student union documentation on\nthe subject, being aware of the fact\nthat the political issues at stake could\nbe extremely complex. During the\ncourse of my investigations I came\nacross much documentation and\nevidence relating to problems faced\nby some Iranian students. These may\nhave been based on a different\nnational situation but appeared to\nfollow a similar pattern. It therefore\ncame as no surprise to me to be\napproached by some Iranian students\nwho, having heard of my involvement\nwith Iraqi student issues, informed me\nthat they, too, had experienced\nproblems. My remarks in the annual\nreport were intended to acknowledge\nthis rather than singling out one\ngroup and ignoring others. This may\nhave been naive and misleading of\nme, in which case again I apologise.\nHowever I am unwilling to believe\nthat I was misled by the Iranian\nstudents who spoke to me; and as long\nas any students of this Union have a genuine problem I will continue to\nsupport them.\nI hope this sheds some light on the\nmatter which,I appreciate, is a delicate one. Incidentally I was happy\nto think that somebody actually got as\nfar as page 4 of my Annual Report in\nthe first place!\nYours,\nChristine Taig\nNo7.

Their\nspread so worried the British Musicians\nUnion that, in 1982, it threatened to\noutlaw computers and drum machines\nfrom recording sessions. When the\nMoog synthesis er was introduced in\n1965, Phil Spector was producing soul\nrecords using full orchestras and\nchoirs\u2014it was the only way he had to\nproduce the lush background sounds that\nhe wanted for songs like You've Lost\nThat Loving Feeling, by the Rightchous\nBrothers. Just ten years later soul groups\nwere using a single Moog, and its\nrelatives like the Oberheims, Arps and\nKorgs to supply the very same type of\neffects. String and brass synthesizers\nwere designed specially for the new\nmarket. Where Spector needed an\norchestra of over 30 performers, the new\ngroups required one or two electronic\nkeyboards.\nIt was the development of the cheap\ntransistor that allowed the production of\nthe synthesizer, and the microchip its\nproliferation. Electric keyboards from\nfirms like Casio are now replacing\nelectric organs in the expanding home\nmarket. The sounds of one-fingered\nversions of Vive Espana to Bosa Nova\nry th ms played on cabinet-sized organs\nare giving way to pre-programmed\nsongs backed by sophisticated drum\nmachines no larger than a briefcase. But\nattempts to design synthesizers have\nbeen made throughout the 20th century;\ntheir efforts always thwarted by the lack\nof technology capable of taking their\nideas.\nThe first attempts at producing music\nusing electricity, in the closing stages of'\nthe 19th century, were mere toys\ncompared with the vision of Thaddeus\nCahill, a keen inventor and musician\nfrom America. Elisha Gray, more\nfamous with his battle over the invention\nof the telephone with Alexander Graham\nBell, had designed a machine he called\nthe \"musical telegraph\". He had found\nhis nephew playing with a strange\nelectrical circuit involving a metal reed\nvibrating against a metal bathtub in the\nsummer of 1874. Inspired by this, he\ndesigned a set of parallel circuits to\nproduce an instrument that played over\nan octave's range. However, Gray\ndropped the project to continue his\nresearch into the telephone system. It\nwas taken up by German, Ernst Loranz,\nwho, in 1885, devised a way of\ncontrolling the sound envelope\u2014the way\na note begins and ends.\nAlong with the 'Singing Arc' of\nWilliam Duddell, an English physicist,\nthese instruments were mere drawing\nroom curiosities. Cahill's Telharmonium\nproject was a far more serious attempt,\nprevented from success by the lack of\nsuitable technology at the time. His idea\nwas to broadcast the sound from his\ninstrument over the telephone lines to\nlisteners wearing headsets far away, or\nto loudspeakers hidden disc reedy behind\nas pid is tr as in hotel foyers.\nThe method he used to generate the\nindividual notes in the machine was to\nthe noise put out by\nthe motors could\nhave easily drowned\nthe music.\nhave a'r he otome'( a type of primitive\nalternator) for each note. It consisted of\na brush rubbing against a cog ged wheel;\nthe intermittent contact would produce\nan oscillating electrical signal, in this\ncase a pure sine wave. Thus the note\nproduced by an individual r he otome would have similar tonal qualities to\nthose played on the higher keys of a flute. Cahil was a keen student of tonal\nphysics and realised that this sound\nwould be too thin and reedy, and so for\neach note he used five r he otomes, corresponding to the fundamental and\nthe various harmonics. These harmonics\ncould be taken out if desired, but if left\nin gave an effect akin to a real musical\nms'tru ment. His original specification\ncalled for 408 individual r he otomes, but\nhe only ever used 144 in the last, and\nlargest instrument. After demonstrating\na small prototype version to prospective\nbackers, he was put in touch with\nvarious investors by George\nWestinghouse of the now multi-national\nelectrics company. With this financial\nsupport he built his second\nTelharmonium\u2014an instrument that\nweighed 200 tons and used up to 15\nkilowatts of power. At the turn of the\ncentury there were no vacuum tubes, no\nway of amplifying a signal to any great\ndegree. This meant that each r he otome required an eleven inch shaft of steel,\neach note about 6 feet, and a whole\noctave, 30 feet. In order to supply the\nrequired six or seven octaves the\nmachine had to be massive. It was\nfortunate that the output of the\nTelharmonium was transmitted; the\nnoise put out by the motors themselves\ncould have easily drowned the music\nIn 1906 the machine was upgraded to\nits final form and moved to New York.\nHowever the telephone transmissions\nbrought complaints about interference\nwith the network, and imperfections in\nthe machine itself caused the business\nto fall apart in 1911, despite widespread\ninterest.\nIn 1920, Russian scientist Leon\nTheremin developed his own\ninstrument, using the newly invented\ntechnology of the wireless. It had no\nmoving parts, and so may be described\nas the first totally electronic musical\ninstrument. The Theremin, as it was\nlater christened, was played by moving\nthe hands around two aerials protruding\nfrom its cabinet\u2014one controlling pitch\nand the other loudness. This way of\ncontrolling the instrument was its major\ndownfall; it meant that it was only ever\ncapable of producing rising and falling\nglissandi effects. While impressive at\nfirst, they quickly bored composers.\nUntil the invention of the modern\nsynthesizer, the Theremin found a niche\nin movie sound effects\u2014used quite\nprominently in the science fiction classic The Day the Earth Stood Still. Despite\nits short-lived popularity, the Theremin\nappeared once again forty years later,\nwhen Robert Moog, inventor of the\nMoog synthesis er, financed himself\nwhilst getting his physics doctorate by\nselling a transistor is ed version of the\nTheremin at 50 dollars apiece. One of\nthose instruments then featured on the\nBeach Boys' Good Vibrations, and it is\nstill being used by avant-garde\nperformer Youssef Yancy.\nThe Theremin spawned renewed\ninterest in electronic music, and related\ninstruments quickly appeared. The\n1930s brought a new emphasis. Up to\nthis point the new technology was\ndesigned to produce brand new sounds,\nbut now electric organs and electric\npianos were beginning to be\ndeveloped\u2014instruments that would\nmimic their acoustic counterpoints,\nusing similar tone-generation principles.\nThefirstelectric organ, designed by\nLaurens Hammond in 1929, used the\nsame tone wheel idea as Cahill's Telharmonium. But Hammond had the\nbenefit of the newly invented thermionic\nvalve and the associated amplifier\ncircuits. Modern organs now have\ntotally electronic oscillators, but\nHammond paved the way for the organs\nthat would be used by jazz and rock\ncombos around the world. The\nHammond itself, despite being in\nessence a very primitive device, lived\non right into the seventies, forming a great deal of the sound of groups like\nProcul Harum and Van der Graaf\nGenerator.\nThe other instruments to be developed\nat this time were existing ones that were\nto be electrically amplified rather than\nimitated. The piano was the first to be\ngiven the treatment, developed by\nclassical piano makers, Bechstein and\nSon in the late 20s. Individual pickups\nover each string converted the vibrations\ninto electrical impulses to be fed through\nvalve amplifiers. Similarly the electric\nguitar was introduced by the Electro\nString Company using Adolph\nRickenbacker's designs during the early\n30s. Ironically, it took the further\ndevelopment of synthesizers for\ncomposers to realise that these\ninstruments could easily be treated to\nproduce new sounds. The modern fuzz-box was made only after rock musicians\nof the 60s found that their valve amps\ndistorted the output from their electric\nguitars by a process known as 'clipping',\nproducing a much rawer-edged sound.\nThe fuzz-box produces the same effect\nwithout seriously damaging an\namplifier, coupled with the fact that the\nnewer transistor is ed versions do not\ndistort in quite the same way. Other\neffects such as Wah-Wah and Distortion\nMultipliers were soon to follow.\nThe first true synthesizer was\nproduced by RCA in 1955, and named\nafter its designers, Harry Olson and\nHerbert Belar. The machine took up the\nbetter part of the studio it was housed\nin\u2014like the computers of the day, any\nambitious synthesizer had to be that big\nto house the required number of valves.\nThe tone generators were\nelectromechanical, like the\nTelharmonium and the Hammond before\nit, this time an arrangement of tuning-fork oscillators, conforming to the\ntwelve note scale. Hammond himself\nhad tried to introduce an instrument\u2014\nthe Novachord\u2014in 1939 which featured\nover one hundred valves, and\nunprecedented sound-shaping controls.\nThe machine, however, was plagued by\ntechnical difficulties surrounding the\ncomplexity of the instrument; difficulties\nthat had been ironed out by the mid-50s. Olson and Belar had for seen that the\nlargest use for a synthesizer would be\nin the popular music market, and\ndesigned it to imitate existing\ninstruments rather than to produce\nentirely new sound. As such it had more\nin common with the modern home-organ, but it was a premonition of the\nstring and brass synthesizers that were\nto appear twenty years later. Despite\ntheir original intention for the machine,\npopular music artists were never able to\nuse it. The majority of its use came from\nexperimental composers and researchers\ninto using computers in music.\nIt was the invention of the transistor\nthat opened the door to mass-produced\nsynthesizers for the popular market.\nbarking dogs, choirs\nand scraped paving l stones could all be\nplayed like a piano.\nWorking independently, Donald Buchla\nand Robert Moog were developing very\nsimilar systems, introduced finally in the\nmid-60s. The new approach to music-synthesis was a voltage controlled\nsystem, which defined pitch, tone,\nmodulation and the envelope\ncharacteristics of a sound. It meant that\noscillators could affect other oscillators\nto produce entirely new waveforms, and\nin turn control other features of a sound.\nEven the tone generators were now an\nelectrical circuit\u2014the transistor circuit\nthat appears on many a problem sheet.\nThe Moog design quickly became the\nmost popular, despite Buchla's use of a sequencer, not least due to the fact that\nthe Moog had a traditional keyboard\nwhile the Buchla had a touch-sensitive\nplate. The original Moog design was a modular studio system, too fragile to go\non the road with bands. This was soon\nremedied by the introduction of the\nMini-Moog, a smaller and far more\nrobust version. Other companies soon\nbegan to introduce their own models\nbased on the voltage controlled system,\nlike Oberheim, Korg, Roland and EMS.\nThe EMS VCS3 was the first that many\nmusicians ever toyed with as it was far\ncheaper than many of its counterparts,\nand also quite unreliable. These early\nsynthesizers were all monophonic\u2014only\none key would play at a time. This fact\ncaused a lot of ridicule for synthesizer\nplayers from'their more highly trained\ncontemporaries playing guitars and\npianos. Bands like Queen and Boston\nproudly displayed \"no sy the sizer s used\"\non their record sleeves in the hope that\nvirtuoso playing meant better music.\nQueen eventually succumbed to the lure\nof the artificial in 1979 by featuring an\nOberheim quite heavily.\nBy this time polyphonic keyboards\nhad been introduced by Moog and\nOberheim, as sy the sizer s moved in to\ntake over the electric organ market.\nSimple computers were soon\nincorporated into the instruments with\nthe introduction of Sequential Circuits'\nbest seller, the Prophet 5. This keyboard t could remember patches that a player\nhad programmed in before and call up\nthe settings automatically. This idea\nbecame the basis of Casio's range of\nhome synthesizers, sophisticated toys\nthat could remember tunes as well as\nsounds and replay them to pre-programme backing tracks.\nHome-computers quickly saw the\nimpact that built-in sound generators\ncould have in their machines and soon\nintroduced the VIC-20 and the Sinclair\nSpectrum. They were vastly inferior to\ntheir true synthesizer parents, but\nshowed how useful computers could be\nin music-production. The\nCommodore-64 featured a far more\nsophisticated sound-system, but the truly\nprofessional system, such as those used\non the Apple, required separate\nkeyboards and synthesizer units.\nEven Moog's design was not ideal; a new wave of digital machines was being\nintroduced, the first being the Synclavier\n(1975). The advent of the integrated\ncircuit had made it possible to make\nsynthesizers that worked on frequency\nmodulation rather than the old style\namplitude modulation, as in the Moogs\nand Oberheims. The digit is ation of\nwaveforms made it possible, at least in\ntheory, to shape them on a microcomputer to produce custom-built\nsounds of great complexity. As\ncomputer speed increased, so more\ndetail could be packed into a waveform.\nThe result was the Fairlight Computer\nMusical Instrument, unveiled in 1979.\nIt made it possible to design complete\nsounds on a computer screen and then\nplay them over a six octave range, it also\nhad the feature of recording sounds\nthrough a microphone and analysing\nthem into their components so that\nbarking'dogs, choirs and scraped paving\nstones could all be played like a piano.\nThe sampler had arrived.\nSuch was the complexity of the\nmachine that unless a musician was\nwilling to spend months training on the\ninstrument, as artists like Peter Gabriel\nand Larry Fast had, special technicians\nhad to be drafted in to program them\u2014\ncreating a whole new breed of\ninstrument technician, mid-way between\na session musician and a roadie.\nNumerous samplers followed, ranging\nfrom \u00a3700 'toys' like the Casio SK-1\nwith its tiny noises through to\nSynchaviers costing over \u00a330,000.\nWith these new machines there seems\nto be little room for development, apart\nfrom the addition of more memory to\nproduce clearer sound\u2014the only goal\nleft now is to make them easier to use,\nand cheaper.\nBut in less than a century, progress\nhas moved at such a rate that one\nelectronic instrument can almost replace\nall others. Whether this is good for the\nmusic industry, or merely setting upon\nthe road of endless records using\nidentical bland sounds of massed choirs\nand orchestras, still remains to be seen.\n\n"

Visitors to ICU Office\nshouldn't be surprised to see various\nof us singing operatic excerpts,\nskating round the floor on bits of\ncardboard and generally showing\ndistinct signs of craziness. I wonder\nif it's possible to last more than a year\nin any job without cracking up\ncompletely?\nMeanwhile, the endless round of\nCollege and Union committees\nbecomes considerably more lively as\ncaution and diplomacy are thrown to\nthe wind. The best example of this so\nfar was Dave Colley at last Friday's Governor's meeting, normally the\nmost formal of occasions. Dave,\nhaving a go at the College Secretary\nover parking permits, was enjoying\nhimself so much that Jackie and I were rolling up our sleeves and\npreparing to restrain him, should he\nhave attempted physical violence.\nBut now, on a more serious note\nFreedom of Speech\nThe College has drafted a set of\nguidelines in response to the Eduction\n(No 2) Act 1986 (Section 43\u2014\nFreedom of Speech in Universities,\nPolytechnics and Colleges). The basis\nof this is that the Union cannot refuse\nto hold a speaker meeting on its\npremises (so long as it is a legitimate\nclub activity) on grounds of policy or\nbeliefs or objectives of the speaker or\nhis/her organisation. If it's felt that\nsuch a meeting will cause trouble, the\nmatter can be referred to the College\nSecretary for a binding decision.\nThis document is unlikely to affect\nIC Union in its current state as our\n'political' activity is almost non-existent. The Act has already had real\nmeaning though for colleges like the\nLondon School of Economics. There,\nthe Union was forced to allow\nmeetings of extreme right-wing\ngroups to take place on its premises\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nWould all clubs and societies who\nstill haven't given me the info of\nyour next year committee, Please do\nso ASAP or there may be problems\nwith your Freshers' Fair stall and\nvarious other little goodies for next\nyear!\nThank you,\nKathy Tait, Union Receptionist\neven though a clear majority at a UGM objected to their premises being\nused for these purposes.\nI am not debating the rights and\nwrongs of 'No Platform' policies\nhere. However it is worth noting that\nthe Education Act\u2014which effectively\nreduces the power of colleges to\ndetermine what happens on their\npremises\u2014coincides with the\nintroduction of the Public Order Bill,\nwhich gives the police power to veto\nany demonstration or gathering in a public place. It is also interesting that,\nat a time when the government is\nreducing funding to colleges and\nexpecting them to become more\nfinancially autonomous,\nadministrative and political\nrestrictions such as this are\nmultiplying. I for one see this as gross\nhypocrisy.\nAIDS\nI apologise for the apparent\ninactivity on the AIDS information\ncampaign. I am currently waiting for\nthe Health Education Unit to send me\n8000 booklets which I ordered several\nweeks ago. If this is a measure of the\nurgency which the 'official' national\nbodies accord to such a campaign then\nI am more grateful than ever that the\nTerence Higgins Trust exists, to\nsupply confidential help and advice to\nanyone worried about AIDS. I am\nvery glad that IC Rag have decided\nto support the Trust throughout the\n1987/88 session.\nThe Terence Higgins Trust helpline\ncan be reached on 833 2971 (7\u201410pm weekdays, 3\u201410pm weekends).

When we rang to\nenquire about the price, we were told\nit would cost \u00a315 for a3 course meal\nand as much wine/lager as we wanted\nuntil 12 midnight. When we rang\nagain to book, this price was\nconfirmed.\nWhen we arrived, we found that the\nprice had gone up! They wanted us\nto pay \u00a320.00 per head, or \u00a312.00 per\nhead for the meal only with no alcohol\nincluded. Also, the most expensive\ncombination of starter, main course\nand sweet came to only \u00a311 and they\nwanted full payment in advance. We\ndecided that since it would be quite\nhard to drink \u00a39 worth of alcohol each\n(assuming that lager was sold at\n'normal' prices rather than \u00a32 per\npint!), we should leave. Clearly, we\nhad been deceived about the price just\nto get us there. The whole thing spoilt\nthe major social event of the Club and\nupset a lot of people.\nWe would like to suggest to other\nIC students that they avoid Crazy\nLarry's unless they are prepared to\npart with a small fortune.\nYours sincerely,\nSteve Kilmurray, Physics II\nBernard Le Due, Chem Eng IV\nJason Grey, Aero 111\nElsbeth Goldie, Life Sci III\nRolf Tietema (Instructor)\nJudith Day, Chem Eng IV\nDave the meat\nDear Sir,\nAt the hustings UGM (7th May),\nthe Deputy President's report stated\nthat Norman's might start selling halal\nmeat.\nIt seems to me that the Union is\nforgetting to cater for the majority;\nwe are not all Muslims or vegetarians!\nTo the best of my knowledge the\nmajority of students at College are\nnormal omnivores.\nSince March there have been no\nnormal meat meals available at\nNorman's during lunchtime. When\nare we going to see a change?

I am involved in two Major\nSubcommittees, and in both there has\nbeen an element of farce surrounding\nthem.\nFirstly, on Publications Board the\nthirteen, read it, thirteen colours\nawarded by FELIX are a joke. If you\nhave thirteen outstanding and\nun believe ably worthwhile\ncontributors, and the regular staff too,\nwhy hasn't FELIX been absolutely\nbrilliant every week? Not to say that\nany one of those awarded did not\ndeserve colours\u2014one cannot know\u2014\nbut those who would know and have\na fair chance to debate them were this\nyear denied this opportunity. The Pub\nBoard Chairman, Chris Martin,\ndecided to break with the usual\ntradition of a meeting between\nhimself, the FELIX Editor, the\nSTOIC Chairman and the IC Radio\nStation Manager, and instead merely\nasked for 'objections' which would\nhave been difficult to justify unless\neach individual case was discussed\nwhich, as I have said, was not. The\ncolours Committee, who awarded the\ncolours, naturally knew nothing about\nindividual contributions to clubs, and\ntherefore could do little but accept\nthem all.\nSecondly, the Social and Cultural\nClubs Committees (No, Dave, the\nSocial Clubs Committee\u2014Ed) . With\namazing incompetence the SCC\nChairman, Richard Eccleston, for the\nsecond year running, managed to\ncompletely mess up the awards for all\nthe clubs involved. Last year, the\ninvitations for nominations were sent\nout the day before they were due in,\nwith the result that many clubs missed\nout. This year, not even one day was\ngiven\u2014no notification whatsoever\nwas given to any clubs on SCC. Then\nhow did the actual colours awarded\nget decided? At one point it was\nthought that the 'nominations' were\none per club, but the apparent truth\nis that names from the attendance of\nSCC meetings were used! I need not\ncomment further on how plain silly\nthis is.\nWith the present arrangement of\ncolours awards, it is time that those\nclub committee chairmen who have\nmessed up (and I only have\nexperience of these two\u2014there may\nbe more!) took their responsibilities\nseriously. There are many people\nwithin Pub Board who now feel their\nSERVICING & REPAIRS\nat\nRICKY' S GARAGE75% discount on labour for IC\nstudents and staff\n(Personal service guaranteed!\n19 QUEENS GATE PLACE\nMEWS SOUTH KENSINGTON\nLONDON S.W.7 Tel: 01 581 1589\ncolours devalued, and many more on\nSCC who, on receipt of last week's FELIX felt shocked and surprised to\nfind their names missing, or in print\non the list!\nIt would be nice if everything ran\nsmoothly, wouldn't it?\nDave Burbage, Doc III\nAccommodation\nBarring any major hiccups at the very\nlast minute, the College appears to\nhave 200 more places in residence in\ntheir grasp at last. This is probably\nthe most significant thing that College\nhas done so far this year, at least as\nfar as students are concerned. If only\na portion of the 200 places are\navailable for allocation at the start of\nnext session it should help to avoid\nthe now familiar chaos in the Student\nAccommodation Office, when too\nmany incoming students are squeezed\ninto too few rooms. In the light of the\nCollege recruitment drive aimed at\noverseas students it is difficult to be\nenthusiastic in the long term, though.\nWhen more fee-paying students are\nattracted to bring in more money,\nmore needs to be spent on\naccommodation. There remains a serious lack of College-maintained\nresidences at Imperial, and though the\nnew premises in Evelyn Gardens are\na great step forward the search for\nnew accommodation must still be\nnumber one priority.\nYet more on Gay news\nAs expected, we have a page of letters\ndevoted to the gay/lesbian issue this\nweek. I was quite amazed to read in\nIan's letter tha he has been\napproached by students who fully\nexpect him to try and close down an\nIC Gay Society and dispense with any\nrepresentation for the gay/lesbian\ncommunity. Though several readers\nmay be getting bored with the\ncontinued priority I am giving to this\nissue, I would suggest to anyone who\nwishes to see the support for gays and\nlesbians come to an end that they\nwrite in and express an opinion as\nquickly as possible; this issue is here\nto stay, and there are enough people\nwho think as I do to prevent it being\nignored.\nCredits\nMany thanks, as so often, to Chris\nEdwards, Kamala Sen, Judith\nHackney, Pippa Salmon, Chris\nMartin, Francis Miers, Dave\nWilliams, Dave Burns, Pete Higgs,\nPete Wilson, Chas Jackson, Christine\nTaig, Al Birch, Steve Gutteridge,\nSunny Bains, Sundiatu Dixon-Fyle,\nLiz Holford, Rachel Black, Neil\nMotteram, Steve Kilmurray, Steve\nShackell and Rose Atkins.\nDavid Jones\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on\nbehalf of Imperial College Union Publications\nBoard and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nCollege sign agreement with RCA for 60 year lease in Evelyn Gardens\n2 0 0 places in Evelyn\nfor Imperial College\nImperial College looks certain to gain 200 places in student\naccommodation for the next academic session. Last Friday the\nCollege exchanged contracts with representatives from the\nRoyal College of Art, the previous leaseholders of the Evelyn\nGardens property. This effectively final is es the deal, though\nthe College is still waiting for the Charities Commission to give\nformal consent for the project.\nNegotiations over the property have\nbeen going on for some time. Two\nweeks ago College administrators\nwere hopeful that they had clinched\nthe ten Evelyn Gardens houses, but\nthis later appeared to be in doubt\nwhen another party put in a higher\nbid. After further discussions, IC\nreached a final agreement to buy the\nlease for \u00a34.8 million, which is to be\npaid in installments, and have been\ngiven planning permission for\nconversion work.\nImperial College will now have\ncontrol of the 200 place residence for\njust over 61 years, after which the\nlease, originally taken for 70 years in\nSeptember 1987 by the RCA, comes\nto an end. This means that the lease\nwill expire at about the same time as\nthe rest of the College's residences in\nEvelyn Gardens.\nIt is expected that the new houses\nwill enable the College to maintain the\nguaranteed places in residence to all\nfirst year undergraduates and first\nyear overseas postgraduates, at least\nfor the immediate future. For the last\ntwo years, these guarantees have\nlooked in considerable jeopardy,\nwhen residence places came to be\nallocated at the end of the summer\nvacation. In an interview with FELIX\nearlier this week the Rector, Professor\nEric Ash, said that the 200 places\nwould be \"an enormous help\" in\npreserving the guarantees of College\nplaces in residence, and described the\nproject as \"one of the most cheerful\nthings of recent times\". Union\nPresident Christine Taig has\nexpressed her support for the Evelyn\nGardens project throughout the\ndiscussion period, despite the\ninevitable increase in student rents. At\nlast Tuesday's ICU Annual General\nMeeting she confirmed that the\nproject was likely to go ahead,\nexplaining that money was better\nspent on cheaper accommodation for\nas many students as possible, as in\nEvelyn Gardens, rather than on a new\n\"luxury hall\" on the Northside of\nPrince's Gardens, as has been\nproposed.\nThe most immediate effect of the\nnew residence in Evenlyn Gardens\nwill be a significant rent increase in\nall other College Halls and Houses.\nThough the exact level of the\nincreases will vary significantly\ndepending on interest rates, which\nmay be affected by the result of the\nGeneral election, there are provisional\nfigures for increases as from next\nautumn. On average College rents\nwill have to increase by \u00a33.50 from\nOctober, with further increases of\n\u00a32.50 and \u00a3 1.83 in October 1988 and\nOctober 1989. The distribution of\nthese increases is still to be decided\nby the Student Residence Committee.\nIt is expected that the rent increases\nin student houses will have to be more\nthan those in the more expensive halls\nof residence in order to prevent the\nhall becoming too expensive for most\nstudents.\nCollege Assistant Secretary\nMichael Arthur said that some of the\n200 places should be ready for\nstudents by October, but thought it\nunlikely that the new residence would\nbe in full use at the start of term,\nbearing in mind recent delays in\nconversion work carried out over the\nsummer.\nOf the 200 new places, there are\nlikely to be 75 in single rooms, 74 in\ndouble rooms, and a further 74 in\ntriple rooms. In addition there will be\nbetween 27 and 32 places in student\nflats.\nTemporarily shelved: an artist's impression of Northside Hall\nFreel Friday May22 nd,1987 No. 7 7 2\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday May 22nd1987 Deep in the dungeon of Beit castle,\nIan Whygate and Alan Ego were\npractising their handshakes. In a few\nweeks' time they would be taking\nover as head citizens of Cheapskate,\nand since all the powerful people in\nthe Surefield fortress were members\nof the Band of Bricklayers, Whygate\nand Ego had decided that they should\nbecome members too. Everyone in\nSurefield was a bricklayer, except for\nArthur Michael, whose wrist was\nnever stiff enough for him to be able\nto shake hands properly. Whygate and\nEgo had spent most of the morning\ncongratulating each other on being\nelected to head citizen and deputy\nhead citizen. Whygate thought he had\nbeen very clever again. He had spent\na whole year talking as loud as\npossible, for as long as possible, on\nas many committees as possible; in\nthe end all the citizens had promised\nto vote for him on condition that he\nkept quiet from now on. Ego thought\nthat Whygate had been very clever,\ntoo, but he had fixed his election in\na much more subtle way. Ego had\nstood very close to the list of\ncandidates for deputy head citizen,\nand whenever another citizen tried to\nwrite their name up he had trodden\non their toes. Funnily enough, he had\nbeen the only candidate applying for\nthe job when Gutters had come to\ncollect all the names.\nWhen he had finished practising\nhandshakes, Ego finished his twelfth\npint and hurried across Cheapskate to\nthe rent collector's office. As well as\nwanting to be a bricklayer, Ego was\nalready a member of the 'Minions',\na secret society founded by\nCheapskate rent collector Lesley\nGrievous Bodily Harm, who had\nrecently changed her name to L Capone in order to save ink. The\nother Minions, Kettle, Custard and\nHamster were already there, and were\ntaking it in turns to fill L Capone's glass for her. As usual, L Capone was\ntalking about Arthur Michael and\nHardlyworthit, the Cheapskate house\nbuilder. \"Something has got to be\ndone, boys\", she was saying. \" All the ceilings in Hardlyworthit's houses\nkeep falling on the citizens' heads,\nand every time it happens\nHardlyworthit and Arthur Michael\njust sit back and giggle.

Arthur\nMichael was feeling very pleased with\nhimself. While Ms Plague and\nMummylonglegs, the citizens'\nleaders, were not looking he had gone\nout to buy a new rubber dinghy for\nhis favourite group of citizens, the\npaddlers. The paddlers had wanted\nthe citizens' treasury committee to\nbuy them a new rubber dinghy, but\nhad asked for so much money that\nthey had been told that they had to\nwait for a year. The paddlers, who\nwere very keen to have a new dinghy,\nhad asked Arthur Michael to buy one\nfor them without telling the rest of the\ncitizens. Arthur Michael had bought\na new dinghy very cheaply, and now\nhe was trying to persuade Ms Plague\nand Mummylonglegs to give him the\nmoney back. He couldn't understand\nwhy they weren't pleased that he had\nsaved them so much money.\nSuddenly, Arthur Michael's phone\nrang. He was horrified to hear John\nSecretary asking him to come up to\nhis office; Arthur Michael had been\nterrified of John Secretary ever since\nthe Cheapskate Board of Gnomes had\ndecided to throw 100 people out of\nCheapskate. He was afraid that John\nSecretary was going to take the\nopportunity to sack him at last. In\nfact, when Arthur Michael got to his\noffice, John Secretary was deep in\nconversation with Derek Dash. Derek\nand John Secretary were planning a devious scheme to make all the\ncitizens get up earlier; Derek wanted\nclasses at Cheapskate school to start\nat 8.30 instead of 9.30. Suddenly\nthere was a shout in the corridor\noutside. Derek looked outside to see\nhis wife, Mad Dash, running past the\noffice, waving her citizen's \"awfully\nnice person\" tie about her head.\n\"Quick\", shouted Derek to Arthur\nMichael, \"go and ring Ms Plague.\nShe'll keep her quiet for a few\nhours\"...\nWill Arthur Michael lose his job?\nWill anyone notice?\nWill Whygatejoin the bricklayers ?\nWhere will L Capone strike next?\nFind out (perhaps) in another\ninstallment of the \"Baron of\nCheapskate\".\n\n"

This ail-American\nrestaurant has been one of the more\npopular student haunts in recent\nyears, due largely to its enormous\nportions and value-for-money prices.\nIts proximity to both Evelyn Gardens\nand the College central make it an\nexcellent venue for group meals.\nIt does have its disadvantages,\nhowever. If you choose to visit\nbetween 7.30pm and 10.30pm there\nis invariably a queue for tables, and\nat peak times this can mean a wait of\nup to % hour\u2014some students make\nvaluable use of this time at the bar,\nwhere you can eat as many crisps with\nspicy dips as you like. The best time\nto go is about 7.00pm when you can\nbe instantly seated, stuffed full and\nout before the crowds arrive.\nDrinks tend towards the expensive\nbut the food works out at about \u00a35 a head. The best value is undoubtedly\nthe 'Slab of Ribs' at \u00a34.95 which\nincludes a side salad, potatoes\n(chipped, au gratin or baked) along\nwith a foot long slab of barbequed\nribs. Other items on the menu include\nChicken Enchilada, Mexican Chilis,\nenormous salads, steaks and tacos.\nShould you still have room left for\nafter s, then there's blueberry ice\ncream, cheesecake, or even chocolate\nfudge cake served hot with cream.\nThe service is quick and friendly\nwith the working policy of get 'em in,\nfill 'em up and then get rid of 'em\npronto. They also do take-aways if\nyou don't fancy waiting at peak times.\nThroroughly recommended.\nJudith Hackney\nSTUDENTS! Ever wished you could type?\nWell now you can - easily.\nSight & Sound offer fully comprehensive\ntraining - fast - in typing, audio, shorthand,\nword/data processing, book-keeping and\ncomputer studies.

The Dehli\nBrasserie, 134 Cromwell Road (just\npast Sainsbury's), is in a class of its\nown if you are looking for Indian\ncuisine in the local area. The\nrestaurant has only been open for just\nover a year, but in that time it has\nbuilt up quite a considerable clientele\nof Imperial College students. Though\nthe range of dishes is a little more\nlimited than at some other restaurants\nin the area, I have not found any of\nthe food it serves prepared as well\nanywhere else. You will not find any\nspectacular variations from 'normal'\nTandoori cooking on the menu, but\nDehli Brasserie\nyou will almost certainly find that\nthey do the more familiar dishes as\nwell as any other restaurant you can\nname.\nThe service is just about the\nfriendliest you are likely to come\nacross, which makes the Dehli\nBrasserie an excellent choice for more\nintimate eating out. The waiters\nalways present all the ladies with a carnation when you leave the\nrestaurant.\nThough it is fractionally more\npricey than better known local Indian\nrestaurants, such as the Kwality, the\nDehli is still excellent value and I thoroughly recommend it for any\noccasion.\nRESTAURANTS\nKowloon\nThe laid-back cafe atmosphere of the\nKowloon makes it an ideal place to\npick up something to eat before hitting\nthe clubs and cinemas in and around\nLeicester Square. The last order is at\n12 midnight so you can even crawl\nthere when they chuck you out of the\npub. The best idea, I find, is to skip\nthe set-meals and head for the soup's page. Feeling hungry? Go for a noodle soup\u2014there's a selection of\nabout 8 but I would definitely\nrecommend the Won Ton Noodle\nSoup (the restaurant's speciality) at\n\u00a31.80. If you're still feeling\nhungry\u2014just the soup can be\nsufficient if you're eating very late\u2014\nturn back a page in the menu and\nyou'll find the noodle and rice dishes.\nThese range from about \u00a32.80 to\n\u00a33.60, ask for an extra bowl as one\nrice or noodle dish will feed 2 people,\nI would recommend the Chicken and\nChinese Mushroom Rice/Noodle or\nthe Braised Brisket Rice (this can be\na bit heavy-going).\nIf you find you self wandering\naround this area of London during the\nday pop into the Kowloon for tea and\ncakes. The tea is obviously Chinese\ntea and the cakes are made downstairs\nin the bakery and are very unusual,\nI would recommend the Lotus Paste,\nMelon Paste or the funny little\nCoconut Ball (thingy s) at about 40p each, they're great fun and you can\nspend as long as you like taking in the\natmosphere of Soho on a Sunday (or\nany) afternoon.\nRose Atkins\nMUSIC\nTesla/Little Angels\nWith all the hype, Telsa were\nguaranteed a good turn out. Neil\nMurray, Atomik Tommy, M Buttz\nand Spike, even Barry Norman was\nspotted outside by yours truly.\nTo be sure of getting in I had to\narrive early enough to get wet in the\nqueue and to catch the support band,\nThe Little Angels. However, they\nwere to spoil the whole show; nothing\ncould follow them. They completely\nblew Tesla off stage!\nThey are a Scarborough five piece\nwith a mean line in catchy riffs that\ndon't just make your feet tap, they\ncome straight out and shake your\nwhole damn leg.\nTheir sound is somewhere between\nVan Halen and Bon Jovi, but their\ntrue strength comes in the way Jim\nand Bruce Dickson (no relation)\nintegrate keyboards and guitar like I though only Deep Purple could.\nWith songs that are clean, gut tzi e and presented by the most\ninstantaneous and (dare I say it)\nperfect bands I 've ever seen, there is\nonly one direction for this band!\nAfter all that, Tesla were a let\ndown. Although their songs are\nstrong and presented in a manner that\nwould make The Scorpions very\nflattered, it lacked the spark that\nmakes a gig something special.\nDespite having an uneasy vocalist\nand a PAW on guitar, the\nmusicianship was faultless and at\ntimes inspiring, the best moments\ncoming where they cranked it down\nfor tracks such as We're no good\ntogether and Modern Day Cowboy.\nOn the whole, Tesla were a band\nwhose music grows on you and\nperhaps given, a few listens, I might\nhave enjoyed the show as much as the\nrest of the crowd.\nDavid Williams\n\n"

Having\nborrowed a boat which was too small\nfor the crew in the cox ed event, they\nrowed well to finish only lA alen th behind the Leander crew, these two\nbeing well in front of the rest of the\nElite fours. In the Elite cox less fours,\nIC was confronted by a high class\nfield of club and university crews and\nby the Notts County Rowing\nAssociation four, who were silver\nmedalists in last year's world\nchampionships.\nIn a close fought race, the IC crew\ncame from well down in the last 500\nmetres to finish second to the Notts\nCounty crew. The only win at\nNottingham on Saturday came in the\nElite Double sculls where the IC crew\nsurprised themselves and their coach,\nwinning by some two lengths from\nLeander Club.\nOn Sunday both IC fours raced in\nthe Elite cox less event and both made\nthe final. Here, the 'heavyweight'\nfour had a very close race with Notts\nCounty, which they were unlucky to\nlose to by only lA a length. The\n'lightweight' four finished in third\nplace, also beating all the university\nand club crews. In the single sculls,\nboth Tony Reynolds and Vince Roper\nshrugged off their problems' of the day\nbefore and won senior C and senior\nB sculls respectively. The IC double\nscull, racing 'lightweight' on Sunday,\nhad a few problems at the start with\na computer which said they didn't exist despite their presence in the\nprogramme. They did, however, go\non to win their second event of the\nweekend convincingly. Another\nmember of Imperial College Boat\nClub, Nick Burfitt raced with the GB\nnational squad at Mannheim Regatta\non both Saturday and Sunday. His\ncrew finished third on both days, in\ncox less fours, only some 2 seconds\nbehind the West German world\nchampions from 1985.\nboring enough to be In dso c Boring Frenchies visit\nEarly last term 26 students from IC\nwere entertained by students of the\nEcole Superieur de Physique et\nChemie in Paris. At the end of term\n31 French students sont arrives at IC.\nIn Paris we were received at the\nBritish Council. Drink, and\nconversation in English, French and\nFranglais abounded. The first two\nraison s d'e tre for the visit had been\nfulfilled. The following day we saw\nthe ESPCI, listened to industrial talks\nand then were bustled into cars for an\nexhibition of student driving a la\nmode francais. We were driven to\nthree French companies (Air Liquide,\nProcter and Gamble (France) and\nRoussel (UCLAF). I visited Air\nLiquide. The technology was\nimpressive, as was the champagne\nand caviar at the reception afterwards.\nThis reception proved to be the start\nof the blur between education and the\nsocial ising which followed.\nLessons in dancing and\nhairdressing at the Folie Bergere was\nnext, then the old boys reception, then\nthe Magnetic Terrace Jazz club and\nfinally a game of 'hunt the hangover'\nin the clouds around the Eiffel Tower.\nA reception at the Institut Francais,\nfollowed by a jazz party in the union\nopened our response. The next day,\nvisits to the Chemical and Electrical\nEngineering departments, a talk by\nDow Chemicals and visits to Air\nProducts and British Gas showed the\nFrench students that Britain does still\nhave some vigour and high tech. That\nevening the social ising began again.\nA car very meal at the Strand Palace\nHotel. A bloat rather than a slur r. The\nnext day the French students were\nsent off on a prize quiz of London's landmarks. This allowed me to make\na quick trip to Sainsbury's to stock-up for the inevitable party. Professor\nAsh provided an excellent informal\nreception at his house which we\nfollowed with trips to Les Miserables\nor Breaking the Code. Fortunately,\nthe theatrical themes were not\nrecreated at The Inevitable Party,\nmuch.\nNow the crucial point. All this was\nachieved at a cost of \u00a336 per ticket\nto France, thanks to generous support\nof industry for this educational and\nsocial exchange of ideas. We are\nparticularly grateful to ICI, IBM,\nProcter and Gamble (France),\nInternational Point, Dow Chemicals,\nKodak, The Old Centralians, The\nAnciens el eves of the ESPCI, and the\nESPCI for financial support totalling\nmore than \u00a34500, and the Rector and\nthe Chemical and Electrical\nEngineering departments for material\nsupport.\nAnyone interested ' in helping\norganise the same thing next year\nshould contact RJ Murray through\nthe Chemical Engineering letter\nracks.\n\n"
