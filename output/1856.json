Currently, polls show former\nPresident Trump and Vice President Harris in key swing states deadlocked with\nno more than a percentage point separating the candidates.\nThe world will certainly be watching,\nwhich in turn means the markets will\nbe watching. Much of the economic discourse in America revolves around who\nwould be better for the market. In the UK,\nour own economic interests may also be\nshaped by the outcome. How might this\nelection influence the US markets, and\nwhat ripple effects could we expect here\nin the UK?\nS&P 500 Historical Performance\nTypically, speculation around US\nstock market volatility leading up to\nthe election is overblown, apart from\nmarket crashes in 2000 and 2008. When\nconsidering the 100 days before and after\nan election, the US markets are calmer\nthan non-election years. Despite this\nrelative stability, questions remain about\nwhether the party in power has a short-term impact on market performance.\nRecent analysis by U.S. Bank investment\nstrategists examined 75 years of market\ndata for the three months following past\nelections. Their findings reveal certain\nscenarios where the market impact has\nbeen statistically significant, depending\non which party takes office.\nPositive Market Outcomes\nWithin the positive market outcomes\n\u2013 two situations were observed. Either\nDemocrats control the Presidency, with\nfull Republican control of Congress, or\nDemocrats control the Presidency and\nthere is split control of Congress.\nWhen comparing the\n3-month returns\nof the\nresults above to non-election years, the\nS&P 500 (a markert index tracking the\nperformance of the largest American\ncompanies)outperformed by about 1.7%.\nNegative Market Outcome\nThe underperformance scenario was\nfound to be correlated with Republican\ncontrol of Presidency with full\nDemocratic control of Congress. These\nresults may complicate any bloviating by\neither party that the market views their\npolicies better than their opponent\u2019s,\nbut one thing is clear, split control is\nsomething at least the S&P 500 values.\nUK Implications\nSimilar to the US, you can expect UK\nmarkets to be rather muted in the short-term following the election next week.\nDespite this, each candidate\u2019s platform\nmay have tangible long-term effects on\nBritish market conditions.\nTrump Policy Proposals\nEconomically, there are\na few of Donald Trump\u2019s\npolicies that could have\nimplications here too.\nTariffs are a large part of\nTrump\u2019s economic platform,\nwith a proposed increase from\n5% to 10% for the UK and the\nrest of Europe. This may\ncause some trade relation\nissues between the two\ncountries and could\nhave tangible\neffect on UK\naccess to\nUS markets.\nOutside of tariffs, Trump has also\nstated he plans to deregulate the oil and\ngas industry. Deregulation in the oil and\ngas industry may be attractive to UK\ninvestors within the energy sector and\nUK companies with offices in the US\nconcerned about energy prices. Lastly,\nhe plans to reduce trade barriers for US\nagriculture. This could cause the UK to\nalter its food and agricultural standards,\nandthosefarmersthatstilloperateunder\nstrict EU rules might have to change their\npractices.\nHarris Policy Proposals\nWhen considering Kamala Harris\u2019s\neffect on the UK economically, the\nHarris administration\nwould likely\nc o n t i n u e\nthe policies set forth by the Biden\nadministration. No meaningful\nalterations to trade policy are a part of\nher platform and she has no intention\nof deregulation in significant sectors\nlike oil and gas or agriculture. This\nmay be preferable to some in the UK as\nexporters can expect business as usual\nand those within the clean energy and\nsustainability sector can expect added\ninvestment interest and US government\nsubsidies in the space.\nUltimately, speculation is just that \u2013\nspeculation. Without a party gaining full\ncontrol of Congress and the Presidency,\nyou can expect changes to come slowly\noutside of the few levers a president can\npull to change the executive branch\u2019s\nposturing on key issues. November 5th\nis quickly approaching and in just over a\nweek, we will have the 47th\npresident and\nthe 119th\nUS Congress.\nHedging elections outcomes: market implications and historical trends\nInterested in writing for the Comments section of Felix?

For example, the United\nNations Environment Programme recently released their Emissions Gap Report 2024. Emissions Gap Reports are\npublished ahead of each COP and assess\nthe gap between pledged greenhouse gas\nemissions reductions and the limits to\nkeep warming to, in this case, 2.0, 1.8, and\n1.5 degrees. Grantham Institute Research\nDirector Professor Joeri Rogelj was a lead\nauthor on the report and Dr Robin Lamboll was among its contributing authors.\nThis report, the fifteenth released,\ncalls for \"a quantum leap in ambition\"\non Nationally Determined Contributions\n(NDCs), which are non-binding emissions targets set by each country. NDCs\nare submitted every five years starting\nin 2020 but can be updated at any time.\nThis cycle lines up with the global stock-take which is intended at informing the\nnext round of climate action plans. The\nfirst\u2013ever stocktake concluded earlier\nthis year. The new round NDCs should be\nsubmitted well in advance of COP30, so\nwe expect some nations to do so before\nCOP29.\nGlobal greenhouse gas emissions were\n57.1 GtCO2\ne last year. UNEP reports a massive 24 GtCO2\ne gap between our annual\nemissions in 2030 including current policies and their 1.5-compatible emissions\npathway. This gap falls to 19 GtCO2\ne when\nincluding all NDCs. Net zero targets, it\nseems, could make a big difference. Assuming all NDCs and net zero targets are\nmet, the world may keep to 2 degrees,\nbut unfortunately policy is so far behind\nmeeting net zero targets: it is as if there\naren't even concepts of a plan, with a 36 Gt\ngap for 2.0 degrees and a 48 Gt gap for 1.5.\nThe Climate Change Committee in\nthe UK has also weighed in on our NDCs.\nThey recommend the UK's NDC to commit to reduce territorial emissions by\n81% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.\nWe've already achieved a roughly 50%\nreduction since 1990 and our current\n2030 NDC puts us almost in line with\n1.5 degree modelled domestic pathways.\nTaking into account the UK's fair share\nof emissions paints a more worrying picture with a requirement for much faster\nreductions ideally to net negative emissions by 2030 and much more climate\nfinance, according to Climate Action\nTracker. This is no surprise given the UK's\nhistorical emissions.\nClimate finance is such a no-brainer,\nit would be funny how little action we're\ntaking if the upcoming devastation wer-en't so frightening. Ignoring the impacts\nof heatwaves, sea level rise, tropical cy-clones, and tipping points (as well as\ndamages to human health and ecosystems - all of which are significant), a 2024\npaper in Nature found that the world is\nmost likely already committed to a permanent income reduction of 19% worldwide by 2049; the impacts are worse in\nSouth Asia and Africa with an approximately 22% income reduction. Globally,\nthis is a cost of roughly $38 trillion /year\nin 2005 international dollars (\u00a349 trillion\n/year). The cost of mitigation in line with\n2.0 degrees ($6 trillion /year) is roughly\nsix times lower than the damages.\nThe state of finance for adaptation is\neven worse. Adaptation is just not sexy\nenough, with less clear short-term incentives for private finance. This is further\ncomplicated by adaptation plans being\nextremely local, despite this usually being a benefit. This leaves most of our\nattention on mitigation, even though\nadaptation pays back four times in risk\nand GDP degradation avoided ($1.7 trillion of investment producing $7.1 trillion\ntotal benefits across five key target are-as). By 2030, UNEP estimates there will\nbe a $140-300 billion annual adaptation\ndemand which is far larger than current\ninvestment.\nAnother report, the World Meteorological Organisation's Greenhouse Gas\nBulletin No. 20 was published on Tuesday, again with a view to inform COP29.\nThe annual publication analyses global\nconcentrations of long-lived greenhouse\ngases after any natural effects and brings\nthe unsurprising news that GHG concentrations continue to rapidly increase and\nhave hit record highs.\nThe Climate COP, for which COP29 will\nbe in November, sits alongside two other\nconventions: the Biodiversity COP and\nthe Desertification COP. Both aim to meet\nevery two years. The Biodiversity COP16\nfinishes today in Colombia and Desertification COP16 will take place in Saudi\nArabia in December.\nIf this feels like a lot of work for a little\nprogress, you're right. But it's important to\nframe this in the context of the role of the\nUN. The United Nations Framework ConventiononClimateChangewasafantastic\nachievement for last century, but as Paul\nDickinson put it, the UN is not meant to\nget you to heaven, but to stop you going to\nhell. With the beyond catastrophic warming scenarios of 4+ degrees now much less\nlikely, there has been some success.\nThe reality is that the people have the\npower. Collective, grassroots, communi-ty-led action has an incredible potential\nto drive us beyond what's easy to the justice we really need. Climate action is a\nstory of opportunity and hope and that's\na story we've got to tell.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001b\u001a\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001a\u0013\u0013\u0013\u001a\u0012\u0016\u0011\u0011\u001a\u0010\u000f\u000e\u001a\u0016\u0012 \u000f\u0015\u001b\u001a \u001a \u001a\n\u0016\u0015\b \u0007 \u0015\u0006\u001a\u0014 \u0005\n\u001a\u0004\u000e\u0004\u0015 \u0003\nENVIRONMENT\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u0019\u0018\u001e\u0017\u0016\u001f\u0015\u001c\u0017\u001a\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001d\u0016\u001c\u0019\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001e\u0018\u0019\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001a\u001a\u0015\u001e\u0014\u001a\u0019\u0013\u0012\u0011\u0019\u0010\u001c\u0011\u001e\u001b\u000f\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001b\u001e\u0016\u0019\u000e \u0019 \u0019\u000e \u000e \b\u0019\u0007\u0006\u0017\u0005\n\n"

Placed adjacent to Starbucks,\nthe outlet does not fail to provide\nstudents with a new cuisine and a little\nmore variety, as students choose their\ningredients Chipotle-style. Felix send its\nFood & Travel team to try their options\nand to give their review.\nThe Ingredients\nYou start by choosing a burrito, or\nthe contents of the burrito without the\ntortilla in a coriander lime rice bowl,\nand a protein. The current options are\nchicken, pork and an unknown plant-based protein named Spicy Oumph.\nIn the second step, you can choose the\nfollowing fillings: shredded lettuce,\npickled jalapenos, refried beans, pico de\ngallo, shredded cheese, shredded vegan\ncheese, sour cream and guacamole. The\nfinal step is choosing one three sauces:\nmild salsa, the spicier chipotle salsa\nor lime crema. Free tortilla chips are\nprovided on the bar in front of the outlet.\nFillings or toppings\nThe portions were deemed reasonable\nfor the cheap price of four and a half\npounds, hence the small portions of\neach filling was understandable, yet\nnoticeably conserved.\nThemildsalsaisverysweet;thepicode\ngallo serves as the better tomato filling.\nThe pickled Jalapenos add an appreciated\nsourness and spiciness that may not be\nfor everyone, but does elevate the taste\nof the dish. And the spicy theme does\nnot end there. Suprisingly, the refried\nbean sauce also provides a little spice. In\naddition, one member of the team noted\nthat the beans were thick, and stuck to\ntheir throat.\nThe guacamole was unfortunately a\ndissapointment. Unlike at Chipotle or\nother burrito-outlets, the guacamole is\nnot a premium and is included in the\nprice, hence it would have been difficult\nfor the La Cantina to provide a good\nquality of an usually pricy topping. The\nguacamole leaves a silky aftertaste that\nsticks onto the tongue. It works decently\nwhen mixed with other ingredients\nwhich cover its texture. Otherwise, the\ncoriander lime rice was well cooked and\nthe tortilla was deemed excellent.\nThe tortilla chips were the highlight,\ngiving away a beautiful crunch, followed\nby a subtle corny taste without the typical\nsalty aftertaste. As a snack, the nachos\nare worth it, since they offer the same\nfillings and sauces, yet without one of the\nthree provided proteins.\nProtein, protein, protein\nThe biggest concerns with fast food\nis protein, as it is costly to provide, often\nskimped upon, and varies highly on the\nsource. The amount of pork and chicken\nwas lower than expected, while the\namount of Spicy Oumph was enough for\nthose who chose it.\nThe team guessed the vegan\nalternative to be seitan, as some pieces\nwere chewy, and the others melted apart\neasily, however they are soya based kebab\nstrips from the company Oumph!.\nMore veggies, fewer sauces\nLa Cantina provides ample sauces\nand all the fundamental ingredients of a\nburrito,yetalargerselectionofvegetables\nand beans could be an improvement. The\nsauces overpowered the taste of other\ningredients and the orange sauce was not\na favourite for its ranch-like cheesy taste.\nOur suggestion is to choose on sauce per\nbowl or burrito, even the staff asks if you\nwant multiple sauces, but not for the\nloaded Nachos.\nLa Cantina\u2019s\nOumph!\nFOOD&TRAVEL\nFoodEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nFelix send their team\nto review La Cantina\nas one of the newest\nadditions to the JCR.\nAn order of one chicken, one pork and one vegan protein rice bowel and a vegetarian buritto with free tortilla chips Charlotte Probstel\nSquash &\nPumpkins\nFoodEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nFoodforHealth\nH\nalloween ended last night, and\nyet there is few reason to ignore\npumpkins and squashes during\nthe late cooling Autumn season.\nNutrients & Benefits\nThe orange flesh is rich with\nbeta-carotene, a form of vitamin A\nfound in plants.

The now ritual \u201cblue or red\u201d\ndichotomy has come to be dreaded more\nthan the old \u201ctrick or treat\u201d, although\nboth traditions are in a tie when it comes\nto their ability to turn grown adults into\nchildren.\nWithDonaldTrumpandKamalaHarris\nin a polling deadlock, the Comments\nteam has put together a selection of\npieces weighing the changes, probing\nthe implications and investigating the\nactors of the world\u2019s most dangerous\ngame of heads-or-tails.\nAll eyes are on the US, as the\nrepercussions of this election will affect\nall spheres. Some estimate the sum of\nbets at an eye-watering $2 billion. Sadly,\nthe editor reckons the only foolproof bet\nis the one against a peaceful transition.\nWith great momentum, come even greater expectations\nEditor\u2019s note\nK\namalaHarris\u2019scelebratednomination\nas the Democratic candidate in\nthe 2024 US presidential elections\nin August gave her popularity a boost\nbig enough for it to hover marginally\nabove Donald Trump\u2019s in the national\npolls. In the last two months, her ratings\ndecreased slightly, while prospective\nvotes for Trump were slowly gaining in\nnumbers. The numbers do not explain\nwhy Harris is losing support, despite her\nwell-received welcome to the presidential\nstage \u2013 yet it may be time to consider the\nposition Harris was placed in and the\nexpectations she was supposed to meet.\nThe catastrophic presidential debate\non June 27 highlighted Joe Biden\u2019s old\nage and lack of fitness, both mentally\nand physically. At the age of 82, this is\nno surprise. At the time of his election,\nBiden was the oldest President to ever\nenter office; Trump was in second place\nat age 70. Three weeks later on July 21st\n,\nafter weeks of public scrutiny and a large\nonline movement pushing him to resign\nfrom the elections, Biden announced his\nwithdrawal, opening the space for his\nVice President.\nHarris entered the scene\nwith \u201cmomentum\u201d,\nas the\nheadlines read. In a time of chaos within\nthe Democratic party, she quickly began\nher presidential campaign, touring states\nand raising significant funds and online\nsupport.AsthenewfaceoftheDemocratic\nparty, the policies of which align with\nthose of the Biden administration, Harris\nwas placed on a liberal media-supported\nvirtual pedestal as a blue saviour rivalling\na red egoist.\nIn all agreement, Harris is an\nimpressive woman \u2013 a well-educated\nlawyer who went from prosecutor to\ndistrict attorney, attorney general, and\nfinally US Senator within 13 years, often\nas the first female or person of colour\n\u2013 and it is because she is a woman that\nher background, current efforts, attitude\nand policies are under heavier scrutiny.\nIt is because she is not a white male\nthat there is an air of uncertainty to her\ncapabilities.\nYet, within a few months, she\nraised over one billion\nUSD, debated\nelegantly against a bigoted man who\nfocused more on debilitating her image\nthan on the wellbeing of his supporters,\nand spent the few opportunities to\npresent herself in the spotlight giving\ninspiring speeches and interviews. The\nexpectations imposed on her, despite\nher intelligent nature and positive stance\non human rights such as healthcare and\nreproductive rights, were not met in the\nminds of the people. What happens when\nyour expectations are high, and you meet\na human? You get disappointed. It\u2019s like\nevery Bumble date you will ever go on.\nClearly, this is not Harris\u2019s first\ntime in the spotlight. She has had her\nopportunities the last four years to\npresent herself, where she\nwas given a rather\nunfavourable rating as Vice President.\nHowever, once a candidate, her\nfavourability ratings improved,\ncontrastingly to the steady unfavourable\nrating of her red opponent. Studying\nHarris, and not her administration nor\nthe claims made by others, as well as\nthe high-pressure environment she was\nplaced in the last four months, was the test\nthat proved she can present a strong front\nwhen challenged by obstacles coming\nfrom every corner.\nEditor\nDesigner\n\u201cWith great momentum, come even greater expectations\u201d\n\u201cCelebrity endorsement trends\u201d\n\u201cA masterclass in marketing\u201d\n\u201cThe second messiah, or how Trumpism weaponised religion\u201d\n\u201cHarris and the leftist vote\u201d\n\u201cHedging elections outcomes: market implications and historical trends\u201d\nGUILLAUME FELIX\nJULIETTE FLATAU\nEMILY JACOBI\nHIMA FAZEEL\nRUBY LYDFORD\nTARUN NAIR\nANUBHA SUKHADA BAL\nMITCHELL ERDLE\nBrought\nto you by\n\n"

Senton was previously the president of UWE Bristol\nand plans to align Imperial College with his new \u201cregressive thinking\u201d approach. NegaFelix had the opportunity\nof meeting with Senton in the Felix office to discuss his\npolicies, accompanied by his campaign manager Jimmy\n\u201cThe Vice\u201d Valentino, known painter and decorator, who\npreviously worked with Senton\u2019s seconder, Emmanuel\nFrederick.\nNegaFelix first questioned Senton on his proposition that \u201cfish and eggs be considered part of the vegan\ndiet\u201d. He told us that this radical idea came from having his first lunch at Plantworks. \u201cThe lack of options\nwas shocking, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI propose we give them\nsomething that tastes good. Avocado maki is shit.\u201d Our\nVegan Affairs Correspondent, Blex Aull, asked for clarification on how this policy would be tackling the animal\nrights issues at the core of veganism. Senton assured us\nall his policymaking follows an organic approach, and\nhe and his team took time to interview multiple fish. A\nnewlywed yellowfin couple from Ocean Catch declared,\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mind if we\u2019re sashimi grade tuna, it\u2019s classy\nand expensive.\u201d Some young, male salmon even extended this sentiment to smoked salmon, as they too were\npartial to a cigarette. One particular Pollock told us that\n\u201csushi is fine, but crabsticks are offensive, discriminato-ry, and group together certain fish cultures just with segregation in mind. I\u2019m not an imitation crab, I\u2019m a proud\npollock.\u201d Senton assured us that all fake crab sticks\nwould be banned from the campus to respect this wish.\nNegaFelix is still waiting for Plantworks and VeganSoc\nto give a statement on how they will deal with this sudden increase in omega-3 fatty acids.\nDespite backlash, Senton remains steadfast on his decision to introduce VAR into College examinations. The\nVAR rooms for the examinations taking place in The\nGreat Hall would operate from the Silwood Park campus in Berkshire. Previously with VAR test-runs there\nhas been a commotion that the exam invigilators may\nhave had connections to UAE officials, but Valentino\ntold Negafelix \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear nothin\u2019 about no UAE of-ficials, capisce?\u201d One student argued that their answers\ndid not have any \u201cclear and obvious errors\u201d, so it should\nnot have gone to VAR at all, as it \u201cinterfered with the\nnatural flow of the course\u201d. IC Union Deputy President\n(Education), Paylor Tomfret, put out a statement to Senton this week: \u201cWhy are they still drawing the lines in\nSilwood? It should be semi-automated like at LSE.\u201d\nMr Senton then drew fire at Imperial\u2019s smoke\u2013free\npolicy. \u201cI think it\u2019s cultural discrimination that we are\nattacking smokers\u2019 rights. I would not only bring back\ncasual smoking on campus but triple it by building a\ncoal power station in the Beit Quad to choke the local\natmosphere. Subsequently, I would turn the Union Bar\ninto an executive smoking lounge. Non-smokers can\nstay in FiveSixEight with all the other virgins.\u201d Outside\nof this, Senton has numerous policies involving equali-ty, even touching on the hotly debated case of\npublic bathrooms.

This has only grown\nsince 2016, with as much as 85%\nof white Evangelical Protestants\nregistered as Republican voters in 2023,\naccording to a Pew Research poll.\nDonald Trump\u2019s Republicans,\nunlike the old guard, have succeeded\nin courting the pious vote by using\nreligion as a bugle call to galvanise\ntheir supporters. This fusion of far-right politics with fundamentalist\nChristianity has given rise to Christian\nnationalists like House Re Marjorie\nTaylor Greene, who vehemently believe\nChristian traditions are under attack\nby external antireligious forces, and\nreligion and politics are one and the\nsame. For them, Trump is a messianic\nleader, and keeping the Democrats out\nof Congress and the White House is\ndoing battle with evil. The January 6\ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat, where the former president\nincited supporters to charge the Capitol\nand prevent the certification of the\n2020 electoral votes, demonstrated\nthe lengths they are willing to go to\nfor this end: many rioters held posters\ndeclaring that Trump was divinely\nanointed to be president, even likening\nhim to Jesus.\nThere are economic factors at play\nas well: US counties in the lowest\nquartile for median household income\nare overwhelming concentrated in\nthe Bible and the Rust Belts, regions\nwith a high prevalence of Evangelist\nProtestants. This gives an insight \u2013\none championed by JD Vance in his\ncontroversial autobiography Hillbilly\nElegy \u2013 into the working-class white\nvoter, who feels politically neglected\nand left in the dust of a reportedly\nstrong economy under the Biden\nadministration. It also explains why\nreligious voters are willing to look the\nother way for a candidate who, at least\nostensibly, cares about their plight.\nThe ramifications of a second Trump\nterm on key religion-adjacent issues are\napparent just from what the party has\nmanaged to do so far. Their biggest\nachievement so far has naturally been\nthe overturning of Roe v. Wade in\n2022 by the conservative majority of\nthe Supreme Court, allowing states to\nlegislate on abortion as they see fit. As\na result, abortion is currently banned\nin 14 states, and despite a nation-wide\npro-choice campaign, South Dakota is\nthe only one of these which will have\nthe issue on the ballot next month.\nWith a Senate majority looking likely\nand close races for the presidency\nand the House, Republicans have the\nchance to seize control of the executive\nand legislative branches. If they do, all\neyes will be on them to see what kind of\ndirection they will take the country in.\nThe second messiah, or how Trumpism weaponised religion\nA\ns a leftist, there have always been\nample reasons not to support the\nDemocrats, but I understand that\nfor many left-wing and liberal Americans, the need to begrudgingly mark\nthat blue box has gotten more urgent\n\u2013 perhaps than ever before \u2013 this time\nround, at least in swing states. However, in this election, the problems in the\nDemocratic party are much more ap-parent, with their stance on Palestine in\nparticular pushing away the leftist and\nnon-white electorates.\nThere is, obviously, a more qualified\ncandidate between Trump and Harris,\nhowever she seems to be ignoring the\nleftist voter bloc almost entirely, in an\nattempt to pinch some swing voters.\nThis is evidenced by her convoluted\nstanceonguncontrol(declaringthatshe\nis a gun owner and will not relinquish\nrights to ownership), and her insistence\non maintaining financial support\nfor Israel while again confusingly\ndeclaring that Palestinians are in need\nof humanitarian aid. Additionally,\nHarris has accepted endorsements\nfrom prominent neoconservatives\nlike Liz Cheney. The question\nfor Harris now is whether she has\ncorrectly gauged which group is\nmore important for her success, or if\nthis choice will cost her the election.\nIn the past, the leftist voters do\nnot appear to have been a group\ninfluential enough to cost the\nDemocrats an election \u2013 in 2016, the\nissue was Trump\u2019s populist mandate,\nas well as poor turnout combined with\nthe failures of the electoral college\nsystem. This time, however, it is not\nso concrete. With news of Palestine\nprotests in American universities\nmaking headlines, alongside third-party candidates gaining support, it is\nnot clear whether ignoring one edge\nof the Democratic spectrum is viable\nfor Harris. Leftist voters, alongside\nArab American\nvoters are, justifiably,\nbecoming increasingly\nmore unwilling to Vote\nBlue No Matter Who,\nand it remains to be\nseen if enough will\nstill vote tactically\nto assure a\nHarris victory.\nHarris and the leftist vote\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial Editorial | 3\nISSUE #1856\nEDITORIAL\nDear Felix,\nIt is surprising the limited treatment UK student finance\nactually receives relative to its obvious importance. Seldom does the subject appear to merit explicit discussion\nexcept as a means toward the furtherance of polemics,\na case in point being your recent editorial in Felix #1855.\nContextually, the plethora of coverage as well as ongoing\nmainstream media focus \u2013 including quality newspaper\ncommentary \u2013 tends to frame the UK student loan system\nin similar terms; redolent of high indebtedness, mounting\ninterest and, by implication, something which is somehow\nunfair and unsportsmanlike. However, as the Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman pointed out many moons prior,\n\u201cThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself \u2013 and\nyou are the easiest person to deceive.\u201d For one thing, the\nstudent loan, though most probably equated to in many\npeople\u2019s minds, differs significantly from its US equivalent;\nit is neither predatory, nor exploitative, much less perennial because it is income-contingent. Graduates therefore\nhave to earn, depending on the plan they are on, somewhere in the mid \u00a320,000 range before triggering repay-ment, this means relatively few will be contributing much\nin their early years of employment. Those that do earn\nabove the average salary will likely contribute a relatively modest amount with only the truly high earners (17%\naccording to a 2023 IFS study) paying anything proportionate to the cost of the loan provided. Furthermore, the\n\u2018loan\u2019 itself lapses after 30 (recently increased to 40) years.\nBecause of these considerations a recent article in the\nTimes Higher Education by this author (16th Sept 2024)\nemphasises a better way to conceive of UK HE student\nfinance is to view it as a tax rather than loan. Martin Lewis, the well-known financial journalist, has been arguing\nalong similar lines on his MoneySavingExpert platform for\nmany years now in an attempt to demystify the financial\ncommitment and costs involved. In the wake of this, the\nquestion that really needs to be addressed is whether a\nstudent should contemplate attempting to pay back the\nloan in full, to which the answer is it\u2019s complicated and depends on one\u2019s earnings as well as the plan involved (al-though the YouTube channel Damien Talks Money gives\nan excellent and up-to-date summary of how to approach\nan answer without lapsing into hard core financial advice).\nThe deterrent effect of language in student finance not\nonly skews its mainstream conceptualisation prejudicing\nthe discussion thereafter, it also comes with another very\nunfortunate recently highlighted side effect (identified by\nthe 2022 Muslim Census Survey which echoes previous\nfindings from Challender & Mason\u2019s 2017 peer reviewed\narticle); it inadvertently discourages potential students\nfrom debt-averse backgrounds \u2013 comprising working and\nmiddle class British people who are not financial savvy\nas well as many practicing Muslims who refuse to deal\nwith loans that incur interest which they believe is prohibited to them. In the latter case, this amounts to around\n120,000 potential undergraduates over the past 10 years,\nincluding 6,000 per year who avoid university education\naltogether, together with another 6,000 per year who refuse the maintenance loan exposing them to considerable hardship thereafter. Admittedly, it appears the majority of suitably trained Muslim jurists conversant with UK\nstudent finance (the British Board of Scholars & Imams,\nBritish Fatwa Council etc and, somewhat ironically, the US\nbased scholar and academic Yasir Qadhi being good ex-amples) reject the notion it is synonymous with the term\nriba or \u201ceconomic exploitation\u201d (usually equated to \u201cusury\u201d) which is explicitly repudiated in the Qur\u2019an; however,\nsuch awareness has clearly not reached everyone in the\ncommunity and doing so will be challenging in the face of\nprevailing orthodoxy and programming absent significant\neffort otherwise. One way to address the situation would\nbe for universities to change the information provided to\nprospective students from their present offerings which\nmostly echo the loan-cum-debt presentation of student finance on institutional webpages, for example. Despite the\nobvious attraction of potentially recruiting more students\ninto the university system, many from a widening participation background, how challenging do readers think this\ntask is given the orthodoxy and programming prevalent in\nthe UK HE sector?\nLetter to the Editor\nI\nspent this past weekend in Paris with a few friends.\nAs is expected of tourists, we visited a few museums (d\u2019Orsay, de l\u2019Orangerie, Louvre) and I was intrigued by the other visitors and the artwork on display.\nIt is not unusual to see the exhibitions dominated by\nthe white artists that embody Western art and culture,\nas these museums represent Europe, and are a product\nof the colonialist wealth these countries were built on.\nMore importantly, very few of my fellow visitors were\nmembers of the Black community. A rough estimate\nbased on the Louvre visitors demographic in 2022,\nyields that, of the 7.8 million visitors that year, about\n300 \u2013 700 thousand were Black. Not even one in eight\nat most.\nSurrounded by the opulence of these buildings, I\nfound myself grateful to have the opportunity to visit\nthese museums and see these famous works of art. And\nin light of the numbers above, I\u2019m reminded that free\naccess to this cultural and artistic treasury is a privilege\nthat the Black community has long been denied.\nIt is in this spirit of recuperation and equality, right at\nthe end of this year\u2019s Black History Month, that I\u2019d like\nto encourage the reader to think of their inherent representative role within their family, their peers, and their\ncommunities. Studying here and working for oneself,\nfor one\u2019s family and friends, provides the opportunity to\ninspire others and claim the education, and the artistic\nand scientific liberation we are owed.\nOver time, my father has shown me that the racism\nwe experience, the injustices and violence we have endured for generations, cannot and should not hold up\nto the will to live a better, fairer life. If today I have the\nopportunity to study at Imperial College it is because\nof his and my family\u2019s sacrifices. In this extremely privileged position, I in turn will do my absolute best to inspire more Black people to take the positions, the roles,\nand the jobs they deserve and have been forced to give\nup because of the consequences of bigoted and inhuman ideals, and horrendous economic exploitation.\nAs I metaphorically walk through centuries of art and\nscience, I am still saddened not to see enough Black\nacademics, engineers, doctors, artists, and political\nrepresentatives around us. I encourage you, the reader,\nto recognise the newly acquired power you hold over\nyour own future and our community.\nA reflection on Black History Month\nRolando Charles\nPhotography Editor\n\n"

Ultimately, I\u2019m very privileged to be part of those\nrooms and I want to make the most\nof them while I am in them.

Emina said, \u201cI don\u2019t have\nproper insight on what it is to be a postgrad\nat Imperial because I had the luxury of being here for my undergrad so I was still well\nconnected with the Union, previous friends\nthat were doing their integrated\nMasters so I still had a community to return to,\u201d but\nseeing how new starters\nat Imperial struggled\nto \u201cexpand[ing] too\nmuch outside of\nthe initial group of\nfriends that they\nmet in the initial\nweek just because they didn\u2019t have time to.\n\u201cMy course specifically was very Autumn Term\u2013\nheavy and I think that really hindered how people made\nconnections early on and especially for a year that really\njust overwhelms you. You don\u2019t really have much capacity outside of doing the work, getting the deadlines and\nall of that so personally I think it depends a lot on from\ntaught course but I think overall taught courses can be\nquite intensive for new students at the university and\nsome can find it difficult to actually take advantage of\nall the services [available].\n\u201cMy experience as a post-grad is definitely what made\nme go for the role and I think it\u2019s given me a special type\nof insight into the difficulties that post-grads face despite possibly not having gone through all of them myself but being quite close to those who have.\u201d\nOne of Imperial College Union\u2019s core aims this year is\ncommunication, especially towards research postgrads,\na demographic that historically hasn\u2019t engaged with the\nUnion.

The rocket, named after dark\nrain-bearing cloud, faced its fair share of\nweather-related obstacles at this year\u2019s\nEuropean Rocketry Challenge (EuRoC).\nCreated in 2020 by the Portuguese\nSpace Agency, the competition brought\ntogether 25 teams from some of Europe\u2019s\ntop technical universities to compete\nin rocket launching. ICLR entered with\ntheir fully student-developed, 3km liquid\nbi-propellent rocket, Nimbus 24. This\nwas ICLR\u2019s fourth time attending the\ncompetition, and their first launch with\ntheir new engine, THANOS-R.\n\u201cThroughout the year we have\ndone loads of testing. Last year we did\nsomething like 20 static fires, all at our\nSilwood campus.\u201d\nThe team achieved flight readiness on\n11th October, the first day scheduled for\nlaunches of the competition. At 4:57pm,\nNimbus 24\u2019s Thanos-R engine ignited for\nthe 20th time this year and the rocket\nsoared to 2.6km altitude, making ICLR\nthe closest team to the 3km target of the\ncategory across the entire competition.\nDespite initially being told by officials\nto abandon all hopes of launching due to\npoor weather conditions, as if scripted by\nfate, an opening in the sky provided them\nwith the perfect window to launch.\nAndrei reflects on this moment: \u201cOur\nteam, when they saw the rocket launch,\nscreamed so loud that we got given\na safety penalty. It was our first fully\nstudent developed rocket, and everyone\nwas really happy. We can\u2019t really blame\nEuRoC - rules are rules\u201d.\nTheteamenteredthecompetitionwith\na fully student-developed, 3km liquid bi-propellant rocket. Nimbus 24 featured an\naluminumairframewithmass-optimised\naluminum alloy structures, composite\nbodywork, a 3U deployable payload and\nthe highest thrust student rocket engine\nseen in the UK. Weighing in at 55kg dry\nand measuring 4.5m long, the top speed\nof Nimbus during the launch was 257\nm/s (963 kph), attaining a maximum\nacceleration of 7.8g.\nICLR came second in three categories\nin the competition: payload, team,\nand flight award. The team award has\nbeen a challenge for ICLR in previous\ncompetitions, but this year they made\nsignificant progress, amassing a total of\n191 out of 200 points. The team claim\nthey would\u2019ve potentially even won\nthe flight award, if it wasn\u2019t for their\naforementioned safety penalty picked up\nfor celebrating their launch.\nMembers of the team expressed their\nthanks to the Aeronautics department,\nMechanical Engineering department and\ntechnical supervisor Dr Aaron Knoll.\n\u201cNone of this would be possible\nwithoutthem.Weare,asoftoday,theonly\nteam in the UK that has its own test site\n(Silwood Park). We thank the Aero and\nMechanical engineering departments\nfor granting us this space. We\u2019d also like\nto thank Dr. Aaron Knoll; he ensures we\nabide by the college rules while being a\nmassive supporter of what we do.\u201d\nFollowing their success at EuRoC 24,\nthe team set their ambitions to two main\nprojects. The first is to build and test a\nnew bi-propellent rocket, in preparation\nfor next year\u2019s competition, and the\nsecond is to build a self-landing rocket\nusing thrust gimbling, much like SpaceX.\nReflecting upon their time in ICLR,\nlaunch team member Soham gave the\nfollowingadviceforthosewithambitions\nof getting involved with rocketry.\n\u201cShow up and show an interest - I see\nthis as a push and pull kind of thing - you\nknow you only get out as much as you\nput in. We\u2019re happy to teach and mentor\nanyone and accommodate people\nproposing their own projects too.\nWhen I first came to Imperial, I didn\u2019t\nknow anything about rocketry, I wasn\u2019t\nparticularly interested in space or rockets\n- I just wanted to do something cool for\nthe year.

The young, trendy socialite\nlooks like he could even seem happy to run for the job,\nunlike his predecessors. Not only that, but we start to\nsee the emergence of a new form of power posing \u2013 the\nwistful look. This poster screams optimism, but in subtle tones. It marks the shift of the Democrat party from\n\u201cgun-toting, freedom-loving, stetson-wearing\u201d policies\nto the more \u201cEast-Coast liberal\u201d approach that we have\ncome to associate with the party today. It is little wonder\nthat his opponent Richard Nixon, famously known for\nhaving a face for radio, lost the campaign.\nRonald Reagan\nThis is Ronald Reagan. You may remember him for such\nfilms as Bedtime for Bonzo and Knute Rockne, All American. For those who do not, you may remember him as\nthe messiah of American conservative politics, whose\nbook of revelations is still referenced by Republicans to\nthis day. Despite having one of the most successful campaigns of any president, this poster is truly a travesty to\nman. The flag looks like it was terribly rendered in MS\npaint and someone turned off the gravity: the stripes\ncrop terribly around his head, and, as a pastiche to his\nfilm days, he looks like he is bursting through the poster\nin a nod to Jack Nicholson in The Shining. His looming\npresence over the White House is undoubtedly what\ngave Roland Emerich the idea to make the iconic flying\nsaucer scene in Independence Day. The poster itself is\none of the worst conjured. However, what captures the\naverage voter is the now familiarly plagiarised slogans,\n\u2018Let\u2019s make America great again..\u2019\nBarack Obama\nThis poster needs no notes, it is the perfect poster \u2013\nit is so\nperfect it even has\nits own Wikipedia article.\nDesigned by artist Shepard Fairey in\nhis classic two-tone style, this poster captures\neverything that Obama and the Democratic party wanted it to convey: the wistful look, the catchy slogan, and\nthe serious politician. This is the image the Democrat\nparty wanted to conjure in one sublime image. But what\ndon\u2019t you see on this poster? You do not see words like\n\u201cFor President\u201d, \u201cVote\u201d, and you don\u2019t even see Obama\u2019s\nown name! But that is part of why this poster is brilliant.\nIt shouts: \u201cThis man is bringing hope, change, and progress\u201d, without spelling it out. Not only that, but this is\na poster that does not treat the public like idiots. You\nknow you can vote, you know who this man is, and you\nknow for what he stands. What else is there to be said?\nKamala Harris\nShepard Fairey is back, but this time the impact that\nObama had with his poster is now absent. The combination of Harris\u2019 wistful look and odd, arguably uncanny,\nsmile does not convey seriousness in the way that Obama did. It feels more as though she has seen someone\nthat she vaguely recognises at a party and is offering ac-knowledgement. Not only that, but the slogan this time\naround, \u201cForward\u201d, is trivial. With a word like \u201cForward\u201d\nyou make the viewer ask themselves, \u201cForward from\nwhat?\u201d Biden\u2019s term in office was lack-lustre at best, and\nthis creates the perception that Harris will simply be\nBiden 2.0, which is really not the case in other areas of\nher marketing, and it certainly will not be a selling point\nfor the American voter. All this poster does is remind\nyou of the Obama poster and you think to yourself, \u201cDo\nyou remember the Obama years? They were decent\u201d,\nrather than making the viewer say to themselves, \u201cI bet\nthe Harris years will be good.\u201d\nKennedy JFK Memorial Library\nObama Shepard Fairey\nObama and Harris Shepard Fairey\nTaft The Library of Congress\nReagan Ronald Reagan Memorial Library\nWashington Crossing the Delaware MMA New York City\n\n"

Students\u2019 can expect increases in the minimum wage, and a\npossible rise in bus fares.\nThis budget, monumental in being the first one delivered by Labour in 14 years and the first delivered by a\nfemale chancellor.\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves has\nplaced a strong emphasis on restoring economic stabili-ty. Reeves has accused the Conservative Party of leaving\nthe country with \u201cbroken\u201d public services; but has strikingly failed to mention any specific financial plans for\nuniversities.\nMinimum wage increase\nReeves has announced that the minimum wages will\nrise this year, with the minimum for 18-20 year olds increasing by 16% to \u00a310 an hour. Moreover, the chancellor has gone beyond the guidance of the Low Pay Commision in increasing National Living Wages by 6.7%.\nThis entails a \u00a312.21 an hour minimum for all workers\naged 21 and over from April 2025. In addition, it has\nbeen asserted that a single adult rate will be gradually implemented, meaning that pay will become equal\nfor all over\u201318s during this government. With inflation\nrates predicted to fall to 2.0%, this budget can be seen\nas primarily an attempt to battle the cost of living cri-sis. Students have faced the brunt of the cost of living\ncrisis, with a survey by the Higher Education Policy\nInstitute finding a record 56% of UK undergraduates\nwork part time; three quarters of them did so in order\nto meet living costs.\nNational Insurance rises\nThe chancellor confirmed a 1.2% increase in employer\nNational Insurance (NI), taking the total to 15%, which\nplaces additional costs on UK universities for staff pay . A\n1% rise in NI contributions would collectively cost higher education institutions approximately \u00a3130 million.\nThis announcement comes during a funding crisis in the\nhigher education sector, and may result in further cuts\nand redundancies. This follows a call from universities to\nraise fees for students by \u00a33,000 a year due to inflation.\nStudents faced disruption to their degrees following\nstrikes by the University and College Union in 2022 and\n2023. Following negotiations in 2024, the Joint Trade\nUnion (JTU), which represents the three trade unions\noperating at Imperial, agreed to a minimum 4% wage\nincrease in May this year.\nBusiness leaders have indicated that recruitment\nnumbers may go down in the short term as their NI\ncontributions increase. This may indicate some issues\nwith graduate jobs, with graduate recruitment slowing\npost\u2013COVID and Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of\nthe Institute of Student Employers (ISE), warning that\ndemands for jobs were already at \u201crecord\u2013high\u201d levels.\n\u201cThe graduate jobs market is tough. There are a lot of\nstudents chasing a small number of vacancies,\u201d Isherwood said, following a recent report by the ISE (see Felix\n#1855).\nTaxes are now at a record high, although reporting\nby the Financial Times indicates this is the norm across\nWestern countries, due to high inflation and poor economic prospects post\u2013COVID.\nBeer, vapes, and other vices\nAdditionally, the chancellor pledged \u201ca penny off the\npints at the pubs,\u201d by cutting duty on draught alcohol.\nDuty rates on non-draught alcohol will increase according to RPI next February. A new flat rate tax on vaping\nhas been introduced, starting in October 2026 as well as\nannouncing an increase in tobacco duty \u201cto maintain\nthe incentive to give up smoking.\u201d This follows a ban on\ndisposable vapes set to be enforced from June 2025.\nA commitment to research\nBeginning her speech by committing to \u201cinvest, invest,\ninvest\u201d, Reeves has pledged to invest \u00a36.1 billion in research and development. In particular, she has vowed to\nfund sectors in science such as engineering, biotechnol-ogy, and medical sciences.\nThis follows a speech at the 2024 Labour Party Conference where the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology expressed that science and\ntechnology are \u201cthe most sustainable route to wealth\ncreation, opportunity generation, secure employment\nand economic growth\u201d.\nTransport fare hikes\nThebusfarecaphasbeenincreasedfrom\u00a32to\u00a33.Whilst\nit is unclear if this will affect London, Mayor of London\nSadiq Khan has confirmed a 4.6% increase in Tube prices in accordance with the fare hike in National Rail.\nNewsWriter\nSALEENA LIVERA\nNewsWriter\nISA DUCHOVNY\nEditor-in-Chief\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\n\n"

Elections are not simply about displays of hard power such as seen in mani-festos, debates, and the occasional caucus, but also displays of soft power: campaign adverts, jingles, slogans,\nand artful posters. Election posters, or the occasional\ncartoon, have been pivotal in displaying candidates to\nthe general populace. In the time of Washington and\nAdams, most of the public would not have even been\nable to put a candidate\u2019s name to a face, or generally\nhave been able to read for what they stand for at all. A\nposter, however, with subtle (or in America\u2019s case, not so\nsubtle) imagery can effectively convey a message more\nclearly to the less literate than any promotional pamphlet could ever hope to achieve. Therefore, this article\ndisplays and eloquently walks through a selection of\npromotional material candidates have stuck on the local community walls over the years. In true Arts section\nstyle, we are bound to candour.\nWilliam Henry Harrison\nWilliam Henry Harrison was, by any mark, the short-est-lived president in US history, dying exactly one\nmonth after taking the oath. However, his poster\nspeaks volumes, long outliving the man. Firstly, it is\nevident to see that he is a man of high military stat-ure: as the last President elect to have initially been a\nBritish subject, his poster reflects the \u201cAmerican Triumph\u201d, although now it looks more like he is about to\nlead a fateful crossing of the Alps. What the observant\nviewer may also notice is the bundle of military items\nat the bottom of the poster, reminiscent of the fasces: a\nsymbol of unity and community at the time, although\nit became defunct after the 1930s due to connotations\nwith fascist imagery. It is very clear what Harrison\nwould have done as President if his immune system was\nnot tired of batting pneumonia: continue to promote\nfreedom to all the \u201cAmerican way\u201d \u2013 with large scale\nmilitary conquest.\nAbraham Lincoln\nOne theme one can notice with a lot of presidential campaign posters is the dual portrait of both president and\nvice-predential hopefuls. While it may seem obvious\nnowadays, it is important to know that a frequent number of presidents before had been military men who had\nfought for the States. Their career had been solidified\nquite easily and the art required to promote them (full\nmilitary dress, heroic posing) was fairly easy to capture.\nIn the case of lawyer and desk jockey Abraham Lincoln,\ncapturing his patriotic tendencies was trickier. Instead,\nhis campaign poster attempts to speak to another American ideal: equality before God. Both the president and\nvice-president are on a level footing with each other,\noffering the idea that both men are equals. This is consolidated with details of both a book of the law, and the\nbook of God, cementing the idea that these men intend\nto abide, represent, and solidify the law of both the human and the divine.\nEugene V. Debs\nPeople oftentimes forget that before 1919, America did\nin fact have a socialist party. This poster retains the\nclassic dual portrait that many candidates had before\nthem. However, this time, the classic American images of God, the constitution, and even the olive branch\nof peace are now absent. Instead, this poster reveals a\ngreat deal about what was on the American political\nagenda at the time: railway expansion, industrialisa-tion, the now prevalent economic divide between the\nworking and middle classes, and also the cultural divide between America\u2019s rural communities in the territories and the industrial heartlands of the east coast.\nWhile Debs was very unsuccessful in his campaign\n(perhaps because Hanford had stolen all his hair), this\nposter does give us a better glimpse into the cultural\nupheaval America was experiencing at the time. The\nage of reconstruction was over, and the age of progress\nemulated by the gilded age, had begun.\nHail to the prints!\nCULTURE\nArtsEditorEmeritus\nGILBERT JACKSON\nAn election season special looking at campaign\nposters through the years\nHeadline: Flag by Jasper Johns jasperjohns.org\nWilliam Henry Harrison The Library of Congress\nLincoln and Hamlin The Library of Congress\nDebs and Hanford The Library of Congress\n\n"

This year, many celebrities have taken to social media to proudly\nshare their vote and encourage their followers to participate.\nA notable endorsement came from\nsinger Taylor Swift on Instagram,\nwho expressed her support for Vice\nPresident Kamala Harris after the second\npresidential debate. Swift made a post\nencouraging her 283 million followers\nto register to vote, which led to 340,000\nvisits to Vote.gov (the Federal voting\nregistration website) within 24 hours.\nHer endorsement disproportionately\nincreased electoral engagement among\nyoung voters \u2013 an underrepresented\ngroup. By bringing pop culture into this\nelection, Swift helped the Democratic\nParty reach a younger audience,\namplifying its message to the masses.\nHer support also encouraged other\ncelebrities to voice their political\nviews.\nThe Democrats\nare not alone in\nleveraging these\ne n d o r s e m e n t s .\nFormerRepublican\npresident Donald\nTrump has\ngarnered support\nfrom high-profile\nfigures\nl i k e\nthat\no f\nbillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who\nhas voiced his agenda through social\nmedia and attendance at Trump\u2019s rallies.\nHis $75 billion donation to American PAC\n(the Trump-supporting political action\ncampaign he started) highlights how\ncelebrities are not just expressing voter\nsupport but are also directly involved in\ncampaigns. This financial backing blurs\nthe lines regarding the extent of celebrity\ninvolvement in modern elections,\npotentially skewing the democratic\nprocess. Moreover, this reliance prompts\nquestions about the authenticity of\npolitical messages and the celebrities\u2019\ntrue motivations.\nThe impact of celebrity endorsements\nonthiselectionisundeniable.BothTrump\nand Harris know that there are one of the\nbest ways to garner support for their party\ninacountryasdiverseastheUS.Thevocal\nand financial backing not only amplify\ncampaign messages but also mobilise\nvoter turnout, disproportionately\namong certain demographics. The\nintersection of celebrity\nculture and politics\nhighlights the evolving\nnature of modern\nelections, where\nthe influence of\ncelebrity figures\ncan undermine\nthe democratic\nprocess.\nA Masterclass in marketing\nI\nam a great fan of the Oscars and the\nGrammys. I love to predict the winners,\ncritique the campaigns, analyse the\nodds, and then watch the long-awaited\nceremony and exclaim an ill-mannered\nsentiment at the television proclaiming\nthe Academy is rigged. If Kamala Harris\nwere campaigning for Best Picture, or\nAlbum of the Year right now, I would\ncertainly say that she has this secured, and\nthat the Academy is greatly in her favour.\nThis is not the case: she is in the running\nfor the next president of the United States.\nThis is not voted on by the Academy, or\nanyacademy,butbytheAmericancitizens\nwho are registered to vote.\nHarris\u2019 and Trump\u2019s marketing feel\nrepresentative of what liberalism and\nconservatism are at their definitions:\nshe is focusing on the shiny new (online)\nworld of the pop culture stratosphere;\nhe is living in the history of traditional\npresidential campaigns.\nHarris\u2019s campaign includes the tropes\nof modern marketing, starting with\nendorsements from a wide array of public\nfigures (Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Taylor Swift).\nThis is an ideal publicity tactic. It reaches\nout to fanbases; Harris\u2019s image aligning\nwith these singers and actors that we see\nevery day. However, it could be argued it\ncreates this narrative according to which\nHarris\u2019 campaign is for these public\nfigures. It feels as though one is in school,\nand the popular classmate has got all\ntheir popular friends to endorse them.\nAlthough I might like them, are they\nappealing to me? Is Billie Eilish\u2019s situation\naligned with my own?\nWhile Trump compromises on many\nof my own values, he is attempting to\nspeak to the everyman, the all-American.\nThere is, however, the notable use of\nElon Musk. Yet even he is acting as\na great logic-based philanthropic\nbillionaire, donating $1 million a\nday to a registered voter in key swing\nstates until the presidential election.\nHe speaks to the average man.\nTrump\u2019s campaign lives in the classic\nRepublican ideology of the American\ndream, appealing to every class and\nevery man, while actually supporting and\nbenefiting bureaucrats, as well as those\nalready in power. And I don\u2019t think Harris\nis doing this. Harris is focused on songs,\nand music, and Beyonce, and Meryl Streep\non a zoom call. Donald Trump got shot\nfor - in his mind and the future voters of\nthe Republican party\u2019s minds - America.\nDonald Trump was photographed, fist in\nair, getting shot for the people of America\n\u2013 and it looks good on paper.\nTrump\u2019s marketing is conversative \u2013\nyes. It calls back to classic photography,\nto Ronald Reagan\u2019s readapted iconic\n\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d, even to the\ncountless assassination attempts of the\ntime. It is rooted in the way things are\nand have been. It is not modern, it is not\nappealing to the pop-culture side of young\npeople, but it works.\nHarris seizes modern marketing by\nthe throat: using TikTok, memes (namely\nthe \u201ccoconut tree\u201d and \u201cbrat summer\u201d).\nShe engages a young audience. CIRCLE\nestimates that only half of the youth (18-29) voted in 2020, an 11-point increase\nfrom 2016, yet still opportunistically low.\nShe is intelligent to focus here. But is the\nmarketing really targeting this? I would\nvote for Kamala Harris, as I believe most\nyoungpeoplewould,butwillyoungpeople\nvote for Kamala Harris? If it were a pop-up\non their screen on TikTok on November\n5th, sure. But registering and going down\nto the voting booth is a different thing.\nTrump\u2019s marketing is pressing. He gets\npeople riled up so that he knows that\nthey\u2019re going down to the voting booth,\nbecausetheytrulybelievethatthatDonald\nTrump will make America great. Harris\nis making Reels and tweeting \u201cKamala =\nbrat\u201d. Is that going to make someone go\ndown to the voting booth? No, it\u2019s going\nto achieve publicity \u2013 to commendable\nheights previously unseen \u2013 and a repost\nof a six-second clip.\n\n"

At seven o\u2019clock, the show began with some\nmusic playing on the pipe organ, followed by speeches\nand awards. After an hour, the film eventually began.\nEscape\u2019s opening scene was thrilling, with my friends\ncommenting that \u201cthis is where the entire budget went\nto.\u201d It introduces our protagonist Im Kyu-nam, played by\nLeeJe-hoon,aNorthKoreansoliderstationedattheDMZ.\nEvery night, he works on his plan to escape, drawing\na map and hiding his tools in different places along his\nroute.Closetothedatehehaschosen,heisforcedtoleave\nearly due to the oncoming rainy weather, which would\nwash away the locations of landmines. Had he found\nsuccess, the movie would have ended after ten minutes:\ninstead, the audience follows Kyu-nam through a series\nof roadbloacks, narrow escapes, and tear-jerking scenes\nofcharacterswecometolove,beforethemovieendswith\nKyu-nam shot in the back, inches away from freedom.\nHow he got there is up to you to find out.\nThe director of the film, Lee Jong-pil, gave a short\nspeech before the movie. He mentioned that \u201cevery film\nhas a deeper meaning\u201d and while this does apply to Escape, he was keen to point out that he wanted to make the\nfilm fun and entertaining. As such, he dusted the film\nwith irony, slipped in modern-day references, humiliated totalitarian dictatorships, and even added a romantic\nRussian queer love story for our antagonist Major Lee\nHyun-sang, played by Koo Kyo-hwan (Peninsula, D.P.) a\ncharacter more loved than despised by the audience.\nOverall, the film is a must-watch thanks to its cine-matography, its score celebrating classical composers\nsuch as Strauss and Chopin, the film editing, and the costumes for the upper-class of the North Korean regime.\nLEAFF opens with Escape\nFILM&TV\nThe opening gala of the London East Asia Film\nFestival invited icons, celebrated directors, and\ncurious students to view the Korean action-thriller.\nFilmWriter\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nSandra Ng on the red carpet Charlotte Probstel Lim Ji-yeon winning Best Actor at LEAFF (top), photographed on\nthe red carpet (bottom) Charlotte Probstel\n\n"

The\nmain difference is that the match\nis broken up into roughly 60 plays, with\nshort breaks in between, which adds to\nthe sport\u2019s intensity. The gameplay in\nAmerican football also quite complicated\nand should not be underestimated.\nIt\u2019s all about gaining distance, short\nand often; you have to move forwards\n10 yards within four plays and then, if\nsuccessful, you get another four plays\nto make another 10 yards. You keep\ngoing until you either get the ball in\nthe opponents\u2019 end zone and score a\ntouchdown or, if you are unsuccessful,\nthe other team takes over possession and\nthey repeat the process, with the goal of\ngetting to your endzone.\nIt\u2019s a very technical sport heavily tied\nto many strategies, but that\u2019s something\nwe can teach most members who have\nnever played before. I like to describe it\nas a game of chess - with real people as\nthe pieces - making it the perfect sport\nfor an Imperial student! We have both an\noffensive and defensive playbook which\nhas all our strategies in. We learn them\nduring \u201cChalk Talk\u201d classroom sessions\non Thursdays and implement them at\ntraining on Tuesdays (at Harlington) and\nSaturdays (at Lillie Rec) so that everyone\nis on the same page on gameday. Chalk\nTalk sessions are crucial, especially\nfor quarterbacks, as they teach the\nquarterback exactly where each receiver\nwill be running. This preparation allows\nfor more precise throws to receivers,\nincreasing the chances of a successful\nplay.\nOur social secretary, Angelos\nAngelidis, who has been a big driver in\nrecruiting, adds: \u201cThis year we\u2019re doing\nmoresocialsandwe\u2019redoingthembigger.\nWe\u2019re also partnering up with our sister\nsociety, Imperial Titans Cheerleading,\nmore this year; Joint family mentoring\nscheme, Thorpe Park trips and, of course,\nour formal dinners are all in our plan. We\nattend every sports night, have regular\nUnlimited Wings socials all over London,\nand plan fun activities such as mini golf,\nbowling and more throughout the year.\nOf course, we also host regular watch\nparties at bars all over London to watch\nsome good old football on Sundays.\u201d\nSadly, there\u2019s a large amount of\nmisinformation about the game \u2013 which\nis a shame as it\u2019s such a beautifully\nintense and intellectual sport. I always\ntell people there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s the most\npopular sport in America \u2013 it\u2019s only a\nmatter of time before it\u2019s one of the most\npopular sports globally, especially with\nits introduction to the 2028 Olympics.\nIthasbeenakeyfocusofthecommittee,\nsince the start of fresher\u2019s week, to show\nthe university and onboarding freshers\nthat, among all the typical european\nsports practiced at Imperial, we exist, and\nto try and challenge people\u2019s perceptions\nof the sport. Based on our recruitment, I\nthink we have achieved this. If you want\nto try out one of the fastest growing\nsports in the UK, send us a message on\nInstagram @ImmortalsAFC.\nUpcoming events:\n10th November\nHome game against City in\nHarlington (the start of our regular\nseason and pursuit for promotion).\n9th February\nUnion\u2019s Sunday Super Bowl viewing, one\nof the best Union nights of the year and\none not to miss for both avid fans and\nstrangers to the sport, so keep an eye out\nfor tickets closer to the time.\nSPORT\nThe Imperial Immortals\nAmerican Football Club\nImperialImmortalsPresident\nDAVID BATES\nDavid Bates, President of Imperial\u2019s American Football Club, Imperial\nImmortals, shares the thrill and strategy behind American football.\nImperial Immortals 23/24 Team David Bates\nAmerican football is\nnot just a game; it\u2019s a\nbeautifully intense and\nstrategic sport that\u2019s\ngrowing rapidly in\npopularity.\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial Sport | 31\nISSUE #1856\nO\nn Monday evening, the richest,\nmost successful, and largest club\nin football history, Real Madrid,\nboycotted one of the sport\u2019s biggest\nnights \u2013 the Ballon D\u2019Or award show.\nAwarded annually by France Football\nsince 1956, the Ballon D\u2019or, or also called\nthe Golden Ball, recognises the world\u2019s\nbest football player based on votes from\ninternational journalists. With a trophy\nof a golden football, the ceremony has\nevolved into the emblem of individual\nbrilliance in the team sport of football,\ndetermining the best player of that year\noutright.\nHistorically dominated by legends\nLionel Messi (8 wins) and Cristiano\nRonaldo (5 wins), the award signifies not\nonly personal achievement but also a\nplayer\u2019s influence on the game and their\nwider character and ethic \u2013 a hot topic in\nthe realm of exceedingly large contracts\nand disputable player characters.\nPerhapsthefactthatRealMadridholds\na record 36 La Liga titles and stupendous\n15 Champions League trophies was\nnot enough for the old previously\ngovernment-funded club. All year, fans\nexpected that one Real Madrid player\nwould take home the title \u2013 be it Jude\nBellingham, Kylian Mbappe, or Vinicius\nJr \u2013 only to be dissappointed, despite\nthe major recent speculations. Instead,\nit was the spanish midfielder Rodrigo,\nwho had won the Premier League,\nUEFA Super Cup, UEFA Club World Cup,\nand the European Championship with\nManchestor City in the previous season.\nI admit, I am not a Manchester City\nfanatical. One may even say I hold a\nparticular dislike for them. However,\nthere is no denying that Rodrigo, known\nas Rodri, is the best holding midfielder\nin the world. He epitomises the ideal\nnumber 6, playing a pivotal role in\nManchester City\u2019s Champions League\ntriumph. He is what every club look for\nin a defensive midfielder\nDuring the 2023\u201324 Premier League\nseason, Manchester City remained\nunbeaten in every match Rodri played,\nachieving a remarkable record of 27\nwins and 7 draws. In stark contrast, they\nmanaged just one win and suffered three\nlosses in his absence. Furthermore, Spain\nenjoyed a perfect Euro 2024 campaign,\nwinning all seven of their matches.\nNeedless to say, when Manchester City\nwere informed Rodri was going to receive\nthe 2024 Ballon D\u2019Or award, they passed\nthe message onto Real Madrid. We exist\nin a modern football world where a\ncertain \u201cThere we go!\u201d spoils all hype.\nVinicius Jr would not be winning it.\nWhat happened next? Absence. From\nthe ceremony at which Real Madrid was\nawarded best club and best coach \u2013\nCarlo Ancelotti won over Xabi Alonso,\nLeverkusens\u2019 coach who went unbeaten\nfor a domestic double \u2013 followed outrage.\nLeft, right, and centre, Madrid and Brazil\nplayers rushed to social media to insist\nthistravesty.Surprisingly,CarloAncelotti\neven thanked Vinicius in his own post.\nKylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham\nwho placed 6th and 3rd respectively,\ndid not comment, supposedly due to\n\u201csocial media problems.\u201d It seems the\ntwo of them experienced basic human\nembarrassment.\nVinicius Jr is a brilliant player. At 24,\nhe is one of the best wingers in the world.\nAny team would be itching to have him\nafter his iconic performances last season.\nBut he only scored 35 goals. The ever-mocked Darwin Nunez scored 31. Mo\nSalah? 39. Cole Palmer? 42. Rodri scored\n21 \u2013 impressive for a defensive player.\nFor an award given for individual\nbrilliance, it is arrogant, and frankly\nembarrassing, to expect an award\nbecause of the club you are in and the\ntrophies you have won. The standard is\nperhaps not what it used to be with the\nlikes of Messi and Ronaldo, but Rodri is\nthe rightful winner of this year\u2019s award.\nA following 4-0 loss against FC\nBarcelona in the El Clasico match and\nLamine Yamal (FC Barcelona) winning\nthe Golden Boy at the ceremony, did\nanything but help Real Madrid\u2019s spirit.\nSoon after, fans left hate messages on\nunrelated Filipino-American songwriter\nOlivia Rodrigo\u2019s Instagram.\nBillionaire backed boys\nboycott Ballon D\u2019or\nSportWriter\nLILA HARRISON\nLila explains the recent Los Merengues\u2019 controversial Eton mess.\nRodri (top) took home the Ballon D\u2019Or award this year, and Vinicius Jr (bottom left) and Jude\nBellingham (bottom right) placed 2nd and 3rd in the standings respectively.

    "content": "1 November 2024 Imperial's Student Newspaper\nback,\u201d and \u201cassessment and feedback has\nbeen kind of plan B just for the time being\nis because, realistically, I need to wait for\nthe reps to take on the roles, otherwise I\ncan\u2019t really feedback from all ends of the\nCollege about what\u2019s actually needing attention.\u201d\nHer aim is to introduce \u201ca mitigating\ncircumstances policy that would allow\nevidence-free extensions. It\u2019s based off\nsomething that other universities are doing where essentially, we\u2019re giving back\nstudents some autonomy around deadlines especially for courses that have a\nlot of assessments. It would be capped at\nthree a year\u201d, to prevent misuse without\nbeing an issue. \u201cStaff have had things to\nsay but I think we\u2019re on the path of seeing\nsomething like this hopefully taken on by\nthe end of the year. And in terms of unifying mit-circs, that\u2019s very difficult just\nwith the IT side that the university uses.\nIt\u2019s not so much a policy thing, more of a\nwhat can actually be implemented with\nthe systems that we have. That means\nthat we have to wait a little bit longer but\nwhat we\u2019re doing now is to try and create\npolicies so that that can inform the tech.\u201d\nI wonder what an unconventional\ncareer path is. To Emina, it\u2019s all the jobs\nyou dream of doing, \u201cI think the first example that comes to mind is a physicist\nwho then decided to be an orchestra con-ductor. He did a full MSci and now just\nconducts orchestras.\u201d She continues, \u201cit\u2019s\nsomething that you wouldn\u2019t possibly\nthink of going into in your first year.\u201d I\nask if journalism is also considered. \u201cIt\u2019s\njust broadening those horizons as early\nas possible,\u201d Emina continues after I ask\nabout why it was a manifesto promise. \u201cI\nobviously see what\u2019s happening in the job\nmarket and I think we\u2019re not seeing that\nmany people actually happy with their\njobs nowadays. I think that comes from\npeople having to choose their careers at\nthe age of 16 and thinking that they are\nlocked into that all the way and I don\u2019t\nthink that\u2019s fair. It came from wanting to\ngive people the opportunity to fully explore themselves which is what university is for it\u2019s not to just hammer away at\nwork and like narrow yourself down into\na specific stream.\u201d\nCollege launches\nImperial Global USA in\nSan Francisco\nNew Innovation Hub to \u201csupport science and tech\npartneships\u201d is Imperial\u2019s first UK-US venture\nEditor-in-Chief\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nI\nmperial College\u2019s first physical presence in the US launched on Wednesday 30th\nOctober in San Francisco.\nThe US hub will \u201csupport new science\nand techonology partnerships\u201d as part\nof Imperial\u2019s core strategy goal of Convergent Science.\nThe aim of the US Hub is to foster relations between \u201cinnovators partnering\non both sides of the Atlantic\u201d in order to\ntarget global challenges.\nImperial Global USA will be led by\nan External Advisory Board, chaired\nby alum Wendy Tan White, who is now\nCEO of software and AI robotics company Intrinsic.\nImperial aims for 100 new science\nand technology partnerships by 2025\nthrough the Global USA hub.\nProfessor Hugh Brady, President of\nImperial College London said: \u201cOpening a physical presence in San Francisco\nis going to supercharge our capabilities\nto support world-leading British science\nand tech to collaborate with American\npartners. Our new hub will be a front\ndoor in the heart of the Bay Area to help\nspin-outs, academics and innovators\ncreate the kind of partnerships that will\nlead to world-changing scientific discoveries.\u201d\nThe news follows the Labour government\u2019s first budget, where it announced\na commitment to funding research and\ndevelopment in order to boost the economy and growth. Peter Kyle, UK Science\nand Tech Secretary said: \u201c Imperial is\nthe first UK university to set up a science\nand tech base in the US and its new hub\nin San Francisco represents a hugely exciting opportunity to bring together the\ngreat minds of UK and US research in\ndriving forward discoveries that benefit\nboth our nations and beyond.\n\u201cBy building on existing successful partnerships, like advancing AI in\nhealthcare and scaling up clean energy\nsolutions, this hub can play a key part in\naccelerating new technologies that will\nfuel economic growth and deliver re-al-world solutions to global challenges\nfor years to come.\u201d\nThe opening of the USA hub follows\nthe development of the WestTech Corridor, based around the existing campuses in London, as part of the current\nstrategy Science for Humanity. Last year\nthe College launched the Pears Cumbria\nSchool of Medicine in partnership with\nthe University of Cumbria. The Global\nUSA hub is the second of four regional\nhubs, with the first opening in Singapore earlier this year.\nLeft: President Hugh Brady speaking at the Imperial Global USA Launch.

The competition was open to many\nuniversities from the south of England\nincluding Oxford and Cambridge.\nTypically, each team contains four\nplayers to give the teams a wide berth\nof subject knowledge, however many\nteams were a few players short; Bristol\nteam B for example only had two\nplayers. Despite this, they still gave a\nstellar performance.\nFor fans of University Challenge, ACF\nFall had an identical game structure.\nTeams fought to buzz in quickly in\nmany initial \u201ctoss-up\u201d questions in\norder to earn points \u2013 and three bonus\nquestions \u2013 for their team. Each game\nlasted around 40 minutes and featured\n20 toss-ups. The tournament was also\nheld in many other places on the same\nday, such as Durham (for all of the\nnorthern universities) and even many\nplaces in the US, for example MIT.\nAfter a long, full day of quizzing,\nImperial came out the other end with an\nalright presentation with Oxford\u2019s first\nteamsecuringthevictory.\u201cEveryonehad\ngreat performances,\u201d Bethany, the Chair\nof Imperial\u2019s Quiz Society, commented.\n\u201cThere were certainly some stand-out\nbuzzers had by all. I think the key thing\nis that everyone enjoyed it.\u201d\nBethany is a third-year student at\nImperial and has been a member of\nQuiz Society since her first year after she\nattended their stall at the Freshers\u2019 Fair.\nIn the years following, she has attended\nseveral tournaments as a contestant\nand been a moderator for many more.\nAn advocate for new recruits, Bethany\nwas one of the people managing this\nyear\u2019s Fresher\u2019s Fair hoping to attract\nmore people in the same way she joined.\nCompetitions like ACF Fall feature\na wide range of subjects that can\nbe asked ranging from STEM topics\nto European history and literature,\n\u201cthere\u2019s something for everyone.\u201d\nSome questions that always stump\ncontestants are the ones about classical\nmusic; if that\u2019s something you have a\npenchant for, then consider joining\nthe society. The tournament took up\nthe whole day with a lot of that time\ndedicated to travelling.\nThe next novice tournament,\nhowever, is being held at Imperial\nCollege London\u2019s campus itself at the\nendofNovemberwithapplicationsopen\nuntil the week before. Quiz Society hold\nweekly buzzer practice sessions every\nMonday at 6pm in the City & Guilds\nBuilding and they\u2019re always looking for\nfresh faces who are interested.\nImperial\u2019s winning University\nChallenge teams all had their start in\nthe quiz society and some still manage\nparts of it like Justin Lee, a de facto\ncampus celebrity following his many\nappearances on the programme.
