    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday October 24th19862 Sharp At The Cards\nDear Dave,\nColin Palmer's article on Blackjack\nin FELIX 750 seems especially\nwritten to confirm his former\nreputation as IC's biggest\nbulls hitter. He tells us 'Blackjack is\nTHE GAME for students of science\nand technology', yet 'hunches play\nan important part' and even 'a little\nbit of ESP is a bonus'. ESP?!? Isn't that a bit much, even coming from\nyou, Colin?\nTo summarise, gambling is fun,\nbut you must do your homework\nfirst; there certainly isn't enough in\nColin's article to turn you into a winner. Read Tulcea's book \"A Book on Casino Blackjack\" (by far\nthe best available on the subject);\nlook up the article on computer\nsimulation in the June '85 issue of\nPersonal Computer World; go to\nthe Wellsoc lecture on Casino\nGambling planned for next term; or\nwrite to me, if you like.\nUri Palmer then goes on to imply\nthat he wins consistently when he\nplays, so it's rather s uprising that he\ngives no figures on how much he has\nor hasn't won. To remedy this, let\nme quote the research of CI Tulcea,\na maths professor from Yale, who\nasserts that the best players can win,\non average, 1.5% of their minimum\nbet per hand, but to insure against a run of bad luck they need to gamble\nwith a capital of at least 400 units.\nThis means that, if you are playing\nfor \u00a31 stakes (the minimum in\nBritain), you must have at least \u00a3400\nyou don't mind gambling with, and\nyour expected profit will be about\n\u00a31.50 per hour if you are one of the\nbest players in the world.\nIt's a pity Colin gives the impression\nthat winning is easy, because he is\nright when he says casino\nrestaurants are excellent (they\nsub sid is e the food from the\ngambling to make sure you don't leave because you're hungry) and\nthere are other perks he didn't mention like free soft drinks -though I doubt if Colin knows what\na soft drink is.\nBut if you're pinning your faith\non ESP, you'll find bending forks a lot easier.\nMartin S Taylor\nDepartment of Computing\nImperial College\nBonus\nOn The\nCards\nDear Sir,\nMay I use your columns to clear up\nan apparent misapprehension\nconcerning the new library\nborrower cards? We have\ndiscovered that many pe op e think\nthat the allocation of 4 book loans\nfrom the Haldane Library forms\npart of their entitlement from the\nLyon Playfair Library. This is not\nso, but is a bonus in addition to them.\nWe have an excellent stock for\nfiction and non-fiction, records,\ntapes, music scores, newspapers,\njournals and maps (mostly for loan)\nwhich includes the Union Library.

It is excellently\nproduced, expertly designed, and\nunashamedly bland in its billing of\nIC as a Utopian centre of\neducation. A few months ago a collection of students, myself\nincluded, was invited to contribute\ntheir Opinions ofthe College. It was\nquickly apparent that the company\ncommissioned to prepare the\nbrochure were not interested in any\nviewpoint which fell short of\nadulation. Fair enough, perhaps;\none would not expect a College\npublication, which had been\ntarget ted from the outset at\nindustry and parents of prospective\nstudents to present a balanced\nviewpoint. Nevertheless, the\nubiquitous flattery of the College is\nnot only laughable, but rather a little distasteful to anyone who\nknows IC well. If only the brochure\nhad addressed itself to some of the\nproblems faced by IC, it would\nhave made a far more respectable\nreview of an academic year.\nRosemary\nOn behalf of David Rowe, Hugh\nSouthey and myself, I would like to\nextend a special thankyou to\nRosemary Hosking for her\nimmense contribution to the\nFELIX office over the last two\nyears.\nCredits\nSpecial thanks to the Careers\nOffice for excessive tolerance.

    "content": "Isitbetter\nto join the Army before or after you graduate? You're probably aware that a young man\nwith a university education can do very well\nfor himself in the Army.\nBut it may have escaped your notice that\nyou can join and benefit before you graduate.\n\u00a317,000 while you study.\nIf you expect to graduate before you're\n25, you can apply for an Undergraduate Cadetship now.\nThis involves attending the Regular Commissions Board which is a three-day selection\nprocess for Officer training.\nIf you pass, you'll go to Sandhurst for three\nweeks' training before taking up your studies\nat university.\nApart from joining your university's Officer\nTraining Corps and spending part of your\nsummer vacation with a regiment, you'll live\njust like other students.\nYou'll pull in a salary of \u00a35,362 in the first\nyear, \u00a36,008 in the second year and \u00a36,658 in\nthe third.\nAfter graduation, you'll return to Sand\nhurst for a7 month Course following wh i<h your commission will be confirmed.\nIn other words, you'll be a Lieutenant with\na starting salary of at least \u00a310,428.\nFive years later, as a mature, self-confident\nyoung man, you can decide to continue your\nArmy career or to make your mark in civilian life.\nThe Army Bursary scheme.\nIf five years seems too long, you can try\nfor an Undergraduate Bursary.\nWith a Bursary, you commit yourself to\nonly three years as a Short Service Commissioned Officer.\nYou won't be subjected to any kind of\nmilitary discipline while at university. But\nyou'll find the Officer Training Corps a useful\npreparation for Army life.\nNaturally, this less committed approach\nwill bring you less financial reward as a student.\nEven so, we'll pay you \u00a3 9 0 0 a year while\nyou're at university to supplement your LEA\ngrant.\nWith a degree under your belt, you'll earn\nat least \u00a310,428 a year and pocket a gratuity of\n\u00a34,440, tax free, if you leave after three years'\nCommissioned Service.\nIf you expect to graduate this year. Assuming you're under 25 with the\nqualities we demand of our young Officers,\nthere is another option open to you: a Short\nService Commission for three years.\nYou'll kick off earning \u00a310,428. And if you\ndecide to leave after three years' Commissioned\nService, we'll hand you \u00a34,440, tax free.\nWhether you're a student or a graduate,\nthe next step is to write telling us about your\neducational qualifications and ambitions and\nwhy you think you'd make a good Officer.\nBrig.

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday October 24th198611 Life After Imperial\nOr: What do\nwe do now\nYour last year and you haven'ta clue what to do next? Awful, isn't it;\nperhaps if you forget about it, it\nwon't happen? Perhaps if you just\nsend off thousands of application\nforms, someone will give you some\nsort of a job which you might enjoy?\nNo, better just ignore the problem'.\nNo, I know, go and see the Careers\nAdvisors, they'll tell you what to do.\nUnfortunately, we can't tell you\nwhat to do, we can help you towards\nthe decision, point you in the right\ndirection to get you started, test out\nwhether you're being realistic but,\nultimately the decision is yours.\nYou're on your own on this one! So\nwhere do you start? Well you could\nstick a pin into every third page of\nthe Graduate Recruitment\nprogramme booklet or you could\ntry to be a bit more systematic about\nit, first of all, you could think about\nit yourself, try to compile a list of\nyour characteristics, traits, your\nvalues, what you want out of life and\nyour skills, what you're good at, not\nforgetting of course those things\nthat interest you and that you enjoy.\nThen, when you look at job\ndescriptions, you can compare them\nwith your personal profile and see\nwhich ones match and hey presto,\nyou know what you want to do next.\nHow did I get here?\nTrouble is, it's not so easy to\nidentify all these things about\nyourself and so here are some tips as\nto how you might go about it. Look\nat your life so far. Why did you\ncome to Imperial, why. are you\nreading Mathematics or Biology or\nwhatever? What have you enjoyed\nof the experience, why, what have\nyou hated? Was there anything in\nyour holiday jobs that you found\nfun or that you discovered you were\nparticularly good at?\nHow about leisure interests, any\nclues there? If you can't do it this\nway round try looking at the jobs\nfirst. Read as many job descriptions\nand adverts as you can and when\nyou spot one that takes your fancy,\ntry and analyse what it is that\nattracts you and then you can look\nfor other occupations containing\nthese factors. Perhaps you've seen\nor talked to people whose jobs seem\ninteresting. What was it about that\njob? Your Careers Advisor can help\nyou with this task or analysing your\nskills and needs by asking questions\nand checking out whether you really\nmean it when you say, for example ,\nthat all you care about is becoming a millionaire by the time you're 30!\nThere are brief descriptions in the\nback of the Directory, ROGET but\nfor more detailed descriptions,\nconsult the series of booklets\npublished by the Association of\nGraduate Careers Advisory\nServices, all available free of charge\nfrom the Careers Library.\nFiendishly\nIngenious\nIf you find all this totally\nimpossible and your Careers\nAdvisor can't help you get started\non the trail then they may\nrecommend that you complete\nGradscope Questionaire which is a fiendishly ingenious little toy. You\nanswer 50 questions and the\ncomputer programme comes up\nwith the top ten jobs, but alas you've\nstill got to answer the questions\nwhat are you good at, what do you\nenjoy, what do you want to do next.\nHave you enjoyed yourself' so\nmuch as a student that you're\nthinking of going on to take a further qualification? There are\nmany reasons for continuing your\nstudies but merely having enjoyed\nyour undergraduate years may not\nbe an adequate motive. Being a postgraduate may turn out to be\nvery different from being an\nundergraduate. Are the elements of\nyour undergraduate life that you\nhave enjoyed still present at\npostgraduate level?\nAnother pretty pathetic reason\nfor taking a further course is\nbecause you can't think of anything\nelse to do or because this career\nchoice business is just too difficult.\nWhat's going to make it easier to\nthink of something else, or to decide\nafter another year or three at\nCollege? If you just continue to\nstudy and take no active steps\ntoward the dreaded future, you'll\nfind yourself in exactly the same\ndithering situation only slightly\nolder!\nBut mind, the worst reason of all\nis falling prey to flattery. You may\nfeel that you're not susceptible but\ncome June, when your degree\nresults are out and notable\nprofessors ask if you'd like to do a PhD with them, it's easy to be\noverwhelmed by the ideas, without\nthinking out the reality. Should this\nhappen to you, beware false pride.\nBeware, the professors have reasons\nof their own for wanting PhD\nstudents and before jumping on to a three year project, weigh up the pros\nand cons and analyse whether it's really the right move for you.\nBefore you get the impression\nthat I am totally against\npostgraduate studies, here are some\nmore positive reasons for this course\nof action. You may simply not feel\nfinished with studying, the more you\nwant to learn. Perhaps there's a part\nof your undergraduate course that\nyou have found particularly\ninteresting and would like to study\nin depth. Many a masters course\ncaters for this need, eg Astrophysics.\nThe most obvious reason is\nvocational. Your chosen career may\nrequire a PhD or a further\nqualification eg research in the\nPharmaceutical industry or\nteaching. You may feel that it will be\neasier to get a job in your chosen\nfield if you possess a further\nqualification eg Geophysics or\nPetroleum Engineering. You may\nwish to change direction and\nanother course can often help eg\nInformation Technology. Another\nword of caution is required here. It's easy to be misled into believing a course is more vocational than it\nreally is. Admission tutors are sure\nto tell you how useful their courses\nare and so make sure you ask what\npercentage of their previous\nscholars are in employe ment and\nwhat they are doing. You might also\ncheck out the value of your chosen\ncourse with some of the employer at\nthe Careers Fair or discuss it with a disinterested person like a Careers\nAdvisor.\nHaving made the decision to\nprolong your student days, the\nobvious next step is to decide where\nyou want to study. The Careers\noffice, Sherfield 309 keeps a reference copy of, 'Graduate\nStudies' which lists all the PhD and\nMasters and many of the Diploma\ncourses available in the UK. We can\nalso point you in the right direction\nfor information on studying abroad.\nThe Lyon Playfair library has many\nprospectuses and also keeps a copy\nof the 'Directory of Research' in\nBritish Universities and Polytechnics which contains detailed\ntitles of PhD projects which have\nbeen carried out recently. Of course,\nyou'll need to check whether you\ncan get the money for your studies\nand whether you need any pre-course experience. To be safe, you\nshould think about applying for\nPhDs and Master's around\nChristmas but for many vocational\ncourses like teaching, you should be\napplying now. If you think that\nthere's the slightest chance of\nwanting to continue your studies,\nthen apply. If you get an offer of a place, you can always turn it down,\notherwise you may find yourself\nhaving to wait a year because you\ndecide too late.\n\"Weigh up the pros and cons\nand analyse whether it's really the right move for\nyou\"\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday October 24th198617I There can be few bands with\nrelatively little chart success that\ncould hope to fill the Royal Albert\nHall with an authentic capacity\naudience, but Everything But The\nGirl managed this on 14th October.\nThe concert was split into two\nparts: during the first half Tracey\nThorn and Ben Watt were\naccompanied by their usual band\nand a jazz group, some of whom had\nplayed on their first album 'Eden'.\nThis collection of intense, highly\npersonal songs is regarded as a classic of lonely bed sitter land and\nhere they managed to reproduce its\njazz sound perfectly, especially with\n'Each and Everyone'. There were\ndisappointingly few songs from the\nalbum 'Love Not Money' but this\nwas compensated for by a number\nof B sides and cover versions\nincluding 'Night and Day'.\nThe second half consisted mainly\nof songs from 'Baby The Stars Shine\nBright' but backing was no longer\nprovided by sax a phone, etc. but by a large contingent from the London\nPhilharmonic Orchestra! The\nsweeping strings and the clarity and\nstrength of Thorn and Watt's voices\ncomplemented one another\nperfectly, most notably in the cover\nversion of 'Always On My Mind'.\nEverything But The Girl did not\nmake the mistake of simply scaling\nup their light and sound system to\nperform in the massive hall; they\nproduced a whole new show in\norder to make the maximum use of\nthe acoustics. They started the\nwhole show with a simple duet\nperformance of 'Come On Home'\nand finished off with the same\nnumber but dramatically accompanied by the wh dle of the\norchestra.\nThis was a show of variety,\nimagination and supreme\nConfidence. Thorn and Watt have\ngreat stage presence and show all the\nsigns of true professionalism.\nHowever they never fall into the\ntrap of taking themselves too\nseriously, as witnessed by the Thorn\nquip about using 'everything but the\nkitchen sink'.\nEverything But The Girl are a band who have progressed a long\nway in the last few years, their\nversatility in musical styles and\nsharp, truthful lyrics make them an\ninteresting band to watch out for in\nthe future. Uz Hol for dI doubt if any of you have noticed,\nbut so far this term, only one of the\nbooks reviewed has been by a women (Mary Renault's 'Fire From\nHeaven'). But this week it's all\nchange and FELIX proudly\npresents two rather good books\nfrom outstanding women writers.\nMy Antonia, by Willa Cather, is a tale of pioneer ning Americans who\nleft home, kin and kindred, to sail to\nthe land of opportunity. Antonia is\na Bohemian girl, the only one of her\nfamily to speak English. Her\nmother, ambitious for her son,\nbrought the family from Europe-her\nfather, pining and homesick, dies\nsoon after in suspicious circumstances. The spirit of the\npra rie, covered in red grass and\nrattlesnakes, the winds and\nblizzards, small-town gossip, comes\nto life. Their is even a sense of\nhomecoming as her chronicler\nreturns from twenty years at\nuniversity, law school and the Big\nCity to find Antonia, surrounded by\nFar from the horrors of Gaston\nLeroux's1911 novel and Universal\nPictures' 1925 movie, Andrew\nLloyd Webber's latest show, 'The\nPhantom Of The Opera' (Her\nMajesty's Theatre, Haymarket) is a tame though entertaining spectacle.\nIt is set in the Paris Opera House\nand concerns a disfigured\nphantom's attempt at gaining the\naffections of a young Soprano,\nChristine (Sarah Brightman). The\nplot is complicated by rehearsals for\n'Don Juan Triumphant' and Tl\nMito' taking place at the opera\nhouse. In pursuit of Christine's love\nthe phantom (a distinguished\nperformance from Michael\nCrawford) interrupts rehearsals and\nperforms varied but unexciting\nmis demean ours: for example,\nsliding down through the theatre on\nthe infamous chandelier.\nBrightman and Steve Barton, as\nher aristocratic lover Raoul\nVicomte de Chagny, perform\ncredible demonstrations of song and\ndance but The Phantom Of The\nOpera's best assets are the special\neffects. The stage is initially clad in\nheavy velvet curtains and collapsed\nback cloths but transforms\nconvincingly into a graveyard, an\nunderground labyrinth and a misty\nlake. There are mystifying illusions\nand many tricks under the\nfloorboards, the best of which are\nthe sprouting candlesticks (these\nwere greeted by rapturous applause\nfrom the audience). For the\nmechanically-minded the show's programme gives a guide to the sub-stage machinery including counterweights, crab winches and\ngraphite d oak fillets!\nThe show certainly entertains and\nis worth queuing for a though it is\nnearly fully booked until next year\nand all those thousands of people\ncan't be wrong, can they?\nJohn Hockridge\nher farm, barns, orchard and\n(twelve!) children, but still with all\nthose shared memories. This book\nmay even help you understand the\nmelting pot of America-published\nby Virgo, it costs \u00a33.50.\nMurder in the English\nDepartment, by Valerie Miner, is\ntotally different-brash, modern and\nwith none of the gentle, reflective\nnature of My Antonia.\nA professor is killed whilst\nattempting to rape a student, and\nsuspicion falls on one of his colleges,\nNan Weaver, a feminist, who has\nbeen organising an anti-sexual\nh arras ment campaign. It all ends\nhappily ever after, though I suspect\nin real life that it wouldn't, but at\nleast some interesting ethical\ndiscussions come out of this book,\nwhich is lively, tightly written and\nwith quite good character sketching.\nIt's published by The Womens\nPress, costing \u00a33.75, and it's also\navailable in the Haldane Library. In\ncase any of you need to know, the\nCollege women's tutor is Susan\nDawson, phone 7015, and the\nUnion Womens Officer is Wendy\nRenshaw. \u201e , _. ,\nSarah Kirk\nVenessa Redgrave as Mrs. Alving in\nIbsen's \"Ghosts\" at the Old Vic.\nThis production of Ibsen's Ghosts at\nthe Young Vic is a meticulous and\nperfect presentation of life's circles:\nThe present and future are merely\npoints on a circumference that will\neventually be repeated.\nWritten just over one hundred\nyears ago, Ghosts deals with incest,\nmother-son relationships, morality\nand immortality with a sharp\nrealism that is matched by super by performances throughout. The\naction centres around two\ncontrasting characters; Mrs Alving\n(Vanessa Redgrave) who represents\nliberalism and change, and Pastor\nManders (Tom Wilkinson) whose\n'moral majority' type of attitude is a little too reminiscent of many public\nfigures today. His reactionary\nstatements against anything that\nremotely threatens the family unit to\nthe status of men over women are\nstill naive and dangerous; 'It isn'ta wife's place to judge her husband'.\nGhosts appear to Mrs Alving in\ndeja vu experiences as she realises\nthat her son, Oswald is following in\nhis father's steps, despite never\nhaving known him. Efforts made to\nescape his evil patriarchal fate fail as\nthe 'sins of the father are visited on\nthe children'.\nThe Sun rises as the son dies.\nDavid Thacker's Ghosts is too good\nto be missed.\nSimon Lewis\n\n"

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday October24 th198612 The Choice\nAn in depth study of\nwhat to look for in the\nperfect employer\n\"How do I choose which employer\nto apply to? They all seem much the\nsame. I 'll apply to the seven largest,\nmost famous employers with the\nmost vacancies and that will\nprobably do.\"\nIt might work but, if you have\nspent any time at all choosing what\noccupation you wish to follow, it\nseems a pity to mess up your future\nhappiness by failing to carry out\nadequate research on your\nprospective employer. There are five\nDirectories of Employers of\ngraduates. 'Register of Graduate\nEmployment and Training'( ROGET); 'Graduate Employment\nand Training' (GET); 'Graduate\nOpportunities' (GO); 'Directory of\nOpportunities' ( DOG) and\n'Directory of Opportunities in New\nTechnology' (DONT). These are a good source for your preliminary\nlist of possible employers. Besides\noutlining the vacancies that they\nmay have, they tell you about the\ncompany's size, its location, its\nrecent graduates brought along to\nCompany presentations. A company is unlikely to bring along\npeople who think it's a foul\ncompany in which to work! So how\ncan you find out which company is\nfor you? Firstly you must know\nwhat you want from an employer;\nWhat sort of environment would\nyou enjoy?, what promotion\nprospects or training would suit you\nbest?, do you want a very open,\nfriendly style of management or\nwould you prefer a more\nconservative formal firm? The\nCareers Fair is a good place to start.\nYou might ask them why they think\nyou should work for them rather\nthan for X and Co although don't sound too arrogant when doing so!\nAnother valuable way of finding out\nabout different employers is at the\nOld Students' Association and\nCareers evening.\nOnce you have narrowed the field\nof employers you can save everyone\nan awful lot of time by checking\nwhether the companies actually\nhave vacancies in the areas for\nwhich you are applying. Every year,\na well known computing company\nis inundated with applications for\ncomputer programming jobs. They\ndo have between 400 and 500\nvacancies but not for computer\nprogrammers.\npattern of employment and even a little of its philosophy. Many\nemployers produce special\nGraduate brochures which provide\nprofiles of recent graduate entrants\nof the 'Day in the life of...' variety.\nThere are many videos for those\nwho prefer watching and listening to\nreading. These can be viewed in the\nCareers Video Room, key from\nSherfield Room 309. Although all\nthese sources will tell you something\nof the companies, they are produced\nand written by the employers\nthemselves and therefore are\nunlikely to paint the companies in\nanything other than glowing terms.\nThe same thing can be said of the\nIf the company is visiting the\ncampus during the Graduate\nRecruitment programme then you\ncan obtain the application forms\nfrom the Careers library. Otherwise\nyou will have to apply directly to the\ncompany.\nAnd finally, think about 'fall back\npositions'. Please consider the\nwisdom of only applying to the big,\nglamourous, well-known comp an ies. Every year on the Imperial\nGraduate Recruitment Programme,\nperfectly respectable companies\nhave to cancel their visits through\nlack of applications. Think what it\nwould do to your chances of success\nif you applied to such a company.\nApplications\nBooks have been written on this\ntopic and so it is not particularly\neasy to condense in.. a ple of\nhundred words or so. A good\napplication is absolutely crucial in\nseeking any job\u2014wu^ut it, you\nhave no chance of an interview, let\nalone the job! The reason why most\napplications fail is because they are\nbadly presented (illegible writing,\ncoffee-stains etc), ill thought-out\nand poorly expressed. One\nemployer reported he had rejected\n90% on those grounds. Perhaps\nmore typically an employer with\nabout 15 jobs might receive 700\napplications and these would be\nreduced to about 150 for the first\ninterview. Thus it really is\nsignificant to get an interview.\nWhat then is the 'secret'? Actually\nthere is no secret at all; just plain\ncommon sense. So here then are a few tips.\n1 Think carefully about what kind\nof job you want, identify possible\nemployers then read up about them\nand their vacancies.\n2 Follow the instructions on the\nform carefully. If they say 'attach a photograph and write in black ink'\nthen you cannot expect too much if\nyou do not send a photograph and\nwrite in blue ink (as a depressing\nnumber of applicants did for one\nemployer last year).\n3 Work out in advance your answers\nto the questions on the form.\n4 Draft and edit your answers to fit\nthe spaces provided.\n5 Answer all the questions. If one is\nnot really applicable to you, explain\nwhy that is so and do not leave the\nspace blank.\n6 Keep it all simple; keep a copy.\n7 Try and view your application\nfrom the employers' point of view.\nWould you be impressed by the\nanswers? It is not likely that you\nwould be if there were broad\nunsupported generalisations eg \"I can communicate well and get on\nwith people\"\u2014is the evidence\nelsewhere on your form?\n8 If you want more help/advice see\nany of the Career Advisors. If also\nafter a few applications you haven't been invited to an interview, come\nand see us again.\nInterviews\nWhen called to interview, the\nunspoken message from the\nemployer is that they like the look of\nyou on paper and so wish to meet\nyou to confirm that view. The\nmessage from the invitation to the\nsecond interview is that \"having\nchecked you out, we'd now like to\ngive you the proper interview from\nwhich we may make you an offer\".\nThus the first interview, often\nheld in the College and certainly for\nthose employers listed in the GR Programme is relatively short.\nMuch will consist of points in your\napplication\u2014'tell me more about\nthat', 'why did you do this?',\n'describe your project?'. In some\ncases there may be a little technical\ncontent. The interview is also a chance for you to ask questions\u2014so\nhave some prepared! In fact be\nprepared all round\u2014dress suitably,\narrive in good time, be friendly and\npositive, look at your interviewer, be\nprepared to smile, be honest\u2014if you\ndon't know the answer to the\nquestion, say so and don't waffle!\nThe second interview is normally\non the employers' premises. This\ngives a special chance for you to\nevaluate the employer (after all it is a two way process)-does the place\nseem a good one in which to work?,\nare the employees friendly?, how are\nrecent graduates getting on?, etc.\nThe employers may have a variety of\ntests for you to do\u2014some use\npsycho metric tests, some use group\ndiscussions\u2014here the important\nthing is not so much whether you get\nthe right answers to the problems\nbut how you deal with other people,\nhow you react under stress. Finally\nthere will be the interview itself, very\noften before a board. Of course you\nwill be nervous but the confidence\nthat comes from a good preparation\ncan help a lot.\nOnce again the Careers Service\ncan be part of that preparation. We\nare easy to find, easy to consult and\nwe are running a comprehensive\nprogramme of talks and seminars;\nwe also have much literature. So if\nyou want any help, do come and see\nus.\n\n"

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday October 24th198624 Annual\nReport\nRape In Hamlet\nA40 year old nurse was attacked in\na College residence in Hamlet\nGardens at 7.15 last Sunday\nmorning. She was walking to work\nalong Ravenscourt Park when she\nwas grabbed from behind, dragged\ninto the basement of one of the\nblocks and raped.\nPolice arrived within an hour and\nreturned twice to question residents\nfurther. A forensic expert examined\nthe basement for fingerprints. A witness, who was taking\nphotographs nearby, was able to\ngive a full description of the man: he\nis coloured, about 6ft tall, of slim\nbuild, has short black hair and was\nwearing a grey jogging suit with a hood. Anyone who saw the man\nbefore or after the attack should\ncontact Detective Inspector Phillip\nShepard at Hammersmith Police\nStation (Tel 741 6071).\nFollowing a meeting between the\ncollege surveyor, Mr Peter\nHallworth, and the landlord's representative, the landlord,\nStrollmoor, has agreed to improve\nsecurity in the Hamlet Garden\nresidences. Doors will now be fitted\nin those blocks where the main\nentrance is open, and all main doors\nwill have locks and spring returns.\nEntryphones are to be installed in all\nthe blocks, which will take about a month, and the entry phone in the\nblock where the attack took place\nwill be repaired by the end of the\nweek. Lights in the stairwells will\nalso be checked more frequently.\nStudent Services Officer Don\nFerguson remarked that any\nsecurity system relies on students\nbeing sensible, for instance outside\ndoors should be kept locked at all\ntimes when not in use. There are no\nopen stairways in other residences,\nhe said, but people must always be\ncareful.\nThe Rector, Prof. Eric Ash, is very\nconcerned about the incident, but he\ndoes not feel that Estates have been\nlax about security and repairs. \"It's very easy to be wise after the event,\"\nhe commented, adding that it was\ncertainly worth looking at security\narrangements in the other\nresidences. Improvements could be\nmade, but there will always be some\nrisks, he concluded.\nCommunity\nChest\nOver 120 students in fancy dress\nparticipated in Human Monopoly\nfor Imperial College Charity Rag on\nSaturday. Due to a great effort by\neveryone who took part, \u00a32304.97\nwas raised for Mencap. Individual\ntotals will be available soon, as will\nthe name of the winner.\nGhostbusters, Martini men with\ntreacle filled glasses, transvestites\nand people with inflatable\n'accessories' went round London,\narmed only with an A to Z,a set of\nclues and a Travelcard. Some very\nstrange items were acquired,\nincluding parking tickets, pairs of\nunderpants, a wrenched crook-lock,\nmatches from the Savoy and even a BBC film\u2014all obtained legally of\ncourse. Everyone who participated\nenjoyed Monopoly, in spite of the\nweather, and all were worn out at\nthe end of the day.\nThe evening concert was also a resounding success, with over 1200\npeople turning up at Hammersmith\nTown Hall. Although slightly\noutnumbered by sixteen coach-loads of Loughborough students,\nIC was well represented and\nincurred the wrath of everyone else\nby making a virtual clean sweep of\nall the raffle prizes.\nRag Chairman Man Tai Tseung\ntold FELIX that he would like to\nthank Emma the Sagittarian guinea\npig, Martin, Carl, Robert, Robin,\nJonathan and Mehesh, and also\neveryone who took part.\nThe Imperial College Annual\nReport for 1986/6 was published\nyesterday. The report was released\nto coincide with the Commemoration Day ceremony. As was\nexpected, the publication is an\nextreme departure from the\nstatistic\u2014filled reports of recent\nyears. The new report has been\nprinted to a very high quality and\nincludes articles on the\nadministration, academic research\nand undergraduate activities at IC,\nas well as a brief statistical section.\nThe Annual Report has been\nre styled to raise the profile of\nImperial College, and in particular\nto promote links with industry.\nULU Bash\nSeveral hundred people converged\non the UL U building in Malet Street\nlast friday for the UL U Intro AllNighter: \"Unstoppable\", sponsored\nby Time Out and the National\nWestminster Bank.\nFor \u00a310.00 students were treated to\nfood, live bands with Terry and\nJerry, The Potato 5, The Sacred\nHearts and Sandie Shaw, as well as\nseveral cabaret acts, most notably\nJenny Lecoat. After the bands, films\nwere shown until 8.00am next\nmorning including the Rocky\nHorror Picture Show and Taxi\nDriver.\nCompetition\nWinner\nA. Bedford of Chem Eng 1 won the\nBouncers competition in the\nOctober 3rd edition of FELIX. She\ncorrectly identified the performers in\nthe show as: Bruce Springsteen,\nShalamar, David Bowie, Whitney\nHouston, Talking Heads, The\nCommadores, Micheal Jackson and\nHarold Faltermeyer,\nShe wins two tickets to the\nHippodrome, an autographed\nposter and a copy of the Bouncers\nRap.\nNORMAN'S.~t hz ff&Lfll/pl*ct to\nUnhn \u00a3ar\n+l pung e$ ar\n* /ff W Alt $ Snacks <wd coffee* Music, Videos, &it tr hu j)! md\nOp&i every du j M; fri: 5-3) - Up* Sun 7 -l03bf x* It Students9\nUnion\n\n"

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday October 24th19864 The 17 Per Cent Solution\nUNDERGRADUATES.\nPart 1 of a feature on\nWomen at Imperial\nCollege. Below, \"from the\nleft, are Sandra Dawson\n(Women's Senior Tutor),\nWendy Renshaw (UG\nWomen's Officer), Mrs.\nAsh, Jane Bowie (WIST),\nThe Boss, Sam\nChittenden (PG\nWomen's Officer).\nMy name is Wendy Redshaw. I am\nthe undergraduate Woman's Officer. It is my job to take care of\nthe women in Imperial College\nespecially the first years who may be\nfinding the traumas of moving into\nLondon, starting at college, being in\na male dominated environment etc.\njust a bit too much to cope with. I am a very approachable person and\nyou are welcome to come and see me\nabout anything at all; if you want to\ndiscuss your course, your career,\nwhat to wear to college,\ncontraception, life, the universe,\nwhatever...and if I can't help you\npersonally then I 'll put you in touch\nwith someone who can. You will\nprobably catch me dashing around\nthe maths department at lecture\ntimes, or at QT (Snack bar) or\nNormans (Union Snack bar) at\nlunch times (you can't miss me as\nI 've got white-blonde hair!)\nAlternatively you can write to me\n(don't forget to put your name and\ndepartment, though, if you need a reply), Wendy Redshaw, Maths 3.\nPOSTGRADUATES\nSandra Dawson; Welfare and\nSocial needs\nAs College Tutor for Women I am\nparticularly concerned with the\nwelfare and social needs of women\nstudents at Imperial College. I think\nI have two main resp on sibi lites. Firstly on a personal level it is often\nhelpful for students to have\nsomeone in college who is outside\nthe immediate sphere of their\nacademic and social life of whom\nthey can seek help and advice. In\nthis role I am always ready to see\nstudents who think it maybe helpful\nto talk to me about issues or\nproblems which arise in their life at\nImperial College.\nSecondly and more broadly I am\nconcerned at the collective and\nsocial level to contribute to the\ndevelopment of a more stimulating\nand enriching social environment\nwithin the college in which all\nstudents with widely different\ninterests and needs can flourish.\nWhy then you may say 'College\nTutor for Women?' Why put the\nemphasis on women? The reason is\nthat members of minority groups -and less than 20% of students at\nImperial are women - sometimes\nfind it difficult to create enough\nmomentum and get enough support\nand resources to secure new\ndevelopments. This can be\nespecially difficult if there are strong\npressures within an established\nculture to behave in particular ways,\nwhich members of minority groups\nmay not want to follow. I want to\nhelp develop more diversity and\nbalance in the ways students can\nlive. Traditionally at least, some\naspects of social life at Imperial\nCollege have not generally been\nhighly rated by the outside world-the image has been one of\ncompulsive masculinity. I would\nlike to support changes in both the\nimage and reality of life at Imperial\nso that no sixth former \u2014 whether\nmale or female - is 'put off from\ncoming to Imperial by this\nreputation. On the contrary one of\nmy objectives is to support moves\nwhich will make the social and\ncultural life at Imperial College a positive attraction rather than a 'necessary evil' which is accepted\nbecause of the benefits of a good\nImperial degree. I would like to help\nto create an environment in\ndepartments, in refectories, in bars,\nin residences and in the unions, in\nwhich all women students will feel as\nmuch at ease as their male\ncounterparts.\nOne consequence of greater\ndiversity and balance of different\ninterests will I hope, be a feeling of\ngreater freedom for women students\nto do and say things 'as women'\nwithout fear of immediately\nattracting, what I am told now,\nseems to be an all too common\nhostile reaction from other students.\nI'm writing to all new women\nstudents inviting them to meet with\nme in groups so that they can let me\nknow the sorts of things they would\nlike to see developing within the\nCollege. I hope students with more\nexperience of Imperial College will\nalso come to see me with any ideas\nand suggestions which they think I may be able to help.\nIf undergraduate women feel\nthemselves isolated at IC, the\nproblem is greatly magnified for\npost grads. In many departments PG Women\nare in tiny minorities and have little\ncontact amongst themselves. They\nmay find it hard to get involved in\nsocial and union activities for lack of\npeople to go along with. Unlike\nUG's, many PG's work almost\nentirely on their own and often have\nno female academics available to\ndiscuss problems with and to act as\nrole models for those who had\nthought to stay on in academia. For\na lot of PG women, college becomes\nmore or less a place simply to study\nin.\nThis is a great loss as there is\nmuch to be gained from contact\nwith others like ourselves. Simply\nhaving other women to share\nproblems, ideas and experiences\nwith can make all the difference.\nWomen who are new to London or\nto Britain can find willing guides to\nlife in the Metropolis. Those whose\nextra-mural activities might\notherwise be confined to the family\ncan find some alternatives. We also\nhope to break down some of the\nbarriers between different women in\nthe college (ie staff, PG's, and UG's) to the mutual benefit of us all.\nAs postgraduate women's officer,\nI see my job as basically 3-fold.\nFirstly along with Sandra, being\nsome one to come to with any\nproblems to do with being a postgraduate women. These may\ninclude tutor problems, harassment\nor plain isolation. Secondly,\norganising events where women can\nmeet each other socially. Those in\nthe pipeline include a welcoming\nevent for new PG women and a series of outings and open houses.\n(Anyone wanting to volunteer to be\ndescended upon for a small\ngathering greatly appreciated.)\nFinally, and more generally,\nworking along with my colleagues\nshown here and with your help (I hope) to make IC a more pela sant environment for women to be in,\nthereby improving the numbers\napplying to come here and staying\nthe course and so making this a better place for everyone.\nHope to see you at WIST and our\nvarious events,\nLove Sam\nAny feedback please to Elec Eng PG\nor int 5155\n\n"

However, the money is\navailable strictly in proportion to\nthe number of extra students taken\non. Prof Ash welcomed the\nGovernment's emphasis on applied\nscience and technology, provided\npure science does not suffer as a result.\nThe Rector announced that two\nIC lecturers have been elected to the\nRoyal College.

Preliminary studies have\nshown that most staff and students\nwould be in favour of such a merger,\nand the Governing Bodies of both\nestablishments feel that it would\nbring great academic advantages, he\nadded.

    "content": "Feature, FELIX, Friday October 24th198613 Things To Remembe\nSome Things to Remember\nGeneral Employment Prospects\nSince the low in 1981/82\nemployment prospects have been\nrising steadily. 'Although full\nUnemployment Rates are one\nobvious indicator of this (and\nImperial is always at or near the\nbottom of that league table), every\nother measure tells the same story.\nThus there are more jobs on offer,\nmore employers asking to visit,\nmore employers having jobs\navailable at Summer Fairs. While all\nthese signs are particularly evident\nhere, the same optimistic reports are\nbeing made all around the country.\nAs might be expected, demand is\nstrongest in such areas as electronics\nand computer science. There has\nalso been a good recovery in\nrecruitment levels in manufacturing.\nFinance (banking, accountancy,\ninsurance, commodities) and\nretailing are two other areas that\nneed a special mention. Most of the\nemployers here are making special\nefforts to attract science and\nengineering graduates.\nAll this does NOT mean that the\n1987 graduates can sit back and wait\nfor attractive job offers. The market\ndoes not operate that way! As an\nexample about 300, electronics\ngraduates were unemployed at the\nstart of the year. It is still vital to\nremember you must be realistic: if\nyou have taken five years for a pass\ndegree do not insist on looking for aR&D job as one graduate (from\nelsewhere in London) did a few\nyears ago.\nTaking a Year Off\nA year off taken before University is\nwelcomed almost universally. Quite\na number think seriously instead\nabout having some time off after\ngraduation and before starting\n(serious!) work. This too can be a very rewarding and productive\nexperience. As usual, however, there\nare some qualifications to be made.\nIf for example you are aged about 21\nor 22 then there is no problem, from\nan age consideration, regarding\nyour eventual career prospects. If,\nhowever, you are 24 or 25 it may be\nless straightforward and it could be\nworthwhile to seek careers advice\nfirst. It is also good that at any age\nyou should have some sort of plan\nfor the year and one which you can\narticulate\u2014perhaps to a future\nemployer. You should be able to\ntalk about what your aims were,\nwhat you gained from the\nexperience, etc. You should also\nthink ahead. For example it might\nbe fun going jacka roo ing in\nAustralia for 12 months but you will\nhardly be well placed to apply for\njobs back in the UK. For just such\nsimple reasons as this, 12 months off\nhave often become 15 or more.\nRemember the vacancy lists in\nSeptember are probably shorter\nthan at another time of the year.\nNevertheless, given some thought\nand planning, some time off after\ngraduation can be fun, productive\nand for many, a time of great\npersonal development.\nTemporary Work\nWhile the great majority of\ngraduates want permanent work,\neach year there are those who, for a variety of reasons, seek temporary\nwork. In thinking of the longer term\ncareer prospects, virtually all\nprevious work experience is useful,\neven valuable. Here in London\ntemporary work is not hard to find.\nI can cover many possibilities, from\npart-time work in MacDonalds to\nchallenging admin strat ive jobs. Job\nCentres can be a good source of such\nwork and there are a number of\nspecialist agencies. Catch 22 is one\nsuch firm (It's harder to get a job\nwithout experience and you can't get experience without a job).\nAlthough your work might be far\nremoved from your ultimate\nambition, it does give valuable\ninsights into people and the nature\nof work. It can also be a useful way\nof funding that year off.\nSummer Fairs\nIt has always been wrong to think of\nrecruitment as being a January to\nMarch phenomenon associated with\nthe Graduate Recruitment Programme, otherwise known as\nthe milk-round. In fact recruitment\nis increasingly becoming an all-the-year round event. Nevertheless\noutside the GRP the next busy peak\nis during the Summer Fairs. This is\nthe time in June and July, starting\nimmediately after finals, when there\nare about 10 Fairs throughout the\ncountry. Of these, London is by far\nthe biggest. This year almost 200\nemployers attended during its three\ndays with a wide variety of jobs on\noffer. Thus these events are\nparticularly useful for those who\nhave not wanted to think about jobs\nprior to graduation.\nTested and Measured for Success\nDatron Instruments is setting the pace in the design of high\ntechnology test instruments - these currently include Digital\nMultimeters.

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday October 24th198621 Firsts\nWin\nFour Out\nof Four\nIC 1st XI continued their fine start\nto the season by making it 4 wins in 4\ngames, and the second league\nvictory. In the main it was a fine\ndisplay of passing football but, as\nthe score line suggests, defensive\nlapses in concentration could prove\ncostly, particularly against better\nteams.\nIC got off to the worst possible\nstart by allowing KQC to take the\nlead in the first minute. It took IC 30\nminutes or so to take control, and\neven then chances were squandered;\nit seemed like it would be \"one of\nthose days\". Five minutes before\nhalf time, however, Nigel Collier\nequalise d with a powerful left-foot\nvolley, after he had cleverly made\nspace for himself on the edge of the\nKQC penalty area.\nThe second half started well as\nskipper Alessandro Lunghi lashed\nhome a loose ball from 12 yards to\nput IC in front. Nigel Collier\nincreased the lead as he ran onto\nDave Lynne's through ball and\nchipped past the KQC goalkeeper.\nIC now began to put on a show for\nthe watching fans as passing\nmovements bewildered the K QC midfield and defence, as chance\nafter chance came and went. K QC pulled one back 3 minutes from time\nfrom a breakaway, but Alessandro\nLunghi restored the two goal\nmargin when a cross-cum-shot\ncurled into the top corner.\nIC Fight Back\nHockey; IC 2nd XI 4, LSE 2nd XI 4\nAfter waiting for the firsts to thrash\nLSE, it soon became our turn to\ncompete. However our match was\nnot to be so one-sided due to our\nlack of ability to control them when\nnecessary. The game started badly\nwhen we conceded an early goal.\nWhenever they broke through, they\nseemed to do so with a1 or 2 player\noverlap, which made things really\ndifficult for the backs, who played\ncourageously to say the least.\nHowever LSE were pushing players\nforward most of the time, which\nmade them susceptible to attack\nfrom our fantastic forwards. Both\nwingers, Mike Foxcroft and\nDuncan Fitter, played brilliantly,\ntaking the ball down the wings and\nplaying it in front ofthe goal several\ntimes.\nOur first goal, however, was\nscored from a penalty flick, by Gary\nKnairesborough. Somehow he sent\nthe goalkeeper the wrong way and\ntricked it into the goal.\nWhen half time came we were 4-2\ndown but we were more determined\nthan ever to win. We had controlled\nthe game so far and yet we were\nlosing.\nIn the second half they only came\nclose to scoring once, and even this\nwas dealt with by the backs and\noutside halves. Dave Whitton, who\nplayed right half, and attacked as\nwell as he defended, set Mike up\nseveral times who, in turn, managed\nto beat his opponent nearly every\ntime and got the vital cross in. With\n5 minutes to go we equalise d with\nthe score at 4-4. Andy Lewis and\nGary had scored 2 goals each by\nnow, partly due to excellent support\nfrom Mark Powell.\nThe number of times we missed\nthe goal in that last five minutes was\nunbelievable; the ball would not go\nin. Losing Gary when he got a stick\nin his eye didn't help much either.\nEverybody had done their part by\nthe end, with the scores level at 4-4.1\nam sure the 2nds will do very well\nthis year, both in the U. A.U. and the\nMiddlesex league.\nResounding Win\nICSC does it again\u20142 weeks in\nsuccession the intrepid sailors\nconquer the opposition with a resounding win.\nIt was down to Sam (Sam who?-Ed), our captain, to demonstrate the\nkey tactics and from then on in it\nwas plain sailing in the match\nagainst Portishead on Saturday.\nHowever, in the afternoon, the\nwind got up to a gusty force 4 and\none of the crew, who shall remain\nnameless, found herself in the drink.\nOn top of it all Gareth found himself\nmid-water without a main sheet\nblock. 2-boat team racing then\nensued while hasty repairs were\nquickly carried out in the 3rd race.\nThis was again successful with\nour new helms Adam and Richard\nquickly learning the finer arts of\nteam racing. Adam and David\nvaliantly covered the rear allowing\nDan and Richard (Surnames!-Ed)\nthrough to first position.\nAfter a crew change, the final race\nincreased the winning margin; Ape\nand Rebecca were first at the start\nand at the finish, with team-mates\nGareth and Jeremy close behind.\nA good day's sailing was had by\nall, with some decent wind for the\nfirst time this term. Hopefully ICSC\nwill do as well at the National Foot\nTrophy next weekend.\nIC Dominate\nRugby; IC 1st XV 22, LSE\n1st XV 10;\nThis was the most important game\nof the season so far, being the first\nmatch of the U AU competition. IC\ngot off to a slow start with LSE\ncamping in the IC half for the first\n10 minutes or so, but the IC defence\nsoaked up all the pressure that the\nopposition could throw (!!-Ed), and\nwent up the pitch to score. The pack\ntook a while to get together\nproperly, but once they did they\ndominated the forward play,\nwinning some good second-phase\npossessions. The match ended in a convincing IC win, which made up\nsomewhat for the matchbox sized\nchanging rooms! This match augers\nwell for the next U AU fixture\nagainst Kent.\nFlying Start\nIC Hockey club have got off to a flying start this year. In their\nopening matches the 1st's slotted\nfive past a hopelessly outclassed UC side, whilst the 2nds had a comfortable 4-1 win.\nThe initial round of the U AU competition saw the club pitted\nagainst the LSE, who were reputed\nto be very strong this year.\nHowever, the l st's notched up\nanother five goals, and the Ladies\nwere just good enough to pip their\nopponents by one goal. The seconds\ndisplayed great character to come\nback from a two goal deficit to level\nthe scores at 4-4 in a keenly\ncontested match.\nAmongst all this success let's not\nforget the stout hearted\nperformance of the 3rd XI. This\ncrack team of high class hatchet men\nhas played with vigour and\nenthusiasm despite losing both their\nmatches this season. They have now\nbeen forced to spend endless hours\nin the bar planning new strategies\nand tactics to defeat their\nforthcoming opponents.\nThe - 1st XI have a testing week\nahead, with an indoor fixture on\nTuesday, a visit from Kent\nUniversity on Wednesday and a Middlesex Cup draw on Thursday.\nIt's early days yet but the team looks\nvery sound and should enjoy some\ndegree of success during the year.\nAnyone who is keen to play\nhockey can contact the club via the\nhockey noticeboard situated just\noutside the Union Bar.\nColemanballs\nThis week we started our league\ntable at Tolworth and we have eight\nteams at the moment. Best\nperformances went to Paul Gaines\n(190). and Richard Ingram (191).\nThe wooden spoon went to our new\ntreasurer Mark Thompson with a handicap score of 125, and once\nagain Trisha Bradley won the draw.\nIf you would like to bowl with us,\neven if you don't want to take part in\nthe league, we meet on Wednesdays\nat 2.20pm outside Aero/Chem Eng\nfoyer.\nNB This week we are having one\nof our 'fun days' where numerous\nprizes will be given away.\nApologies to Cycling Club\nand to Cross Country, and\nto all those who submitted\nresults slips. We hope to\nhave a proper results table\nas from next week; please\nremember to include the\ndate.\n\n"

It is a scheme\nwhich encourages its members to\nthink about the problems of the\npoor, the Third World, Developing\nCountries, the \"South\" or whatever\nterm you use to describe the other\npart of an unequal world. Members\nof the scheme pay 1% of their\nincome (about \u00a3t1 term,\nequivalent to about h<m a pint a week in IC units) by bankers order.\nThis regular form of payment is\nused to make it a commitment, not\nan impulsive gesture which occurs\nwhen a collecting box and your\nconscience coincide.\nHalf of this money is paid to a group of Charities of your choice;\ngenerally these will be involved in a range of long-term projects, not\nemergency aid. The remainder is\nspent on information for members\nwhich includes a number of special\ncampaigns and a quarterly\nmagazine.\nIf you feel the Third World\ndeserves more thought and\ncommitment than listening to BandAid or emptying your pockets\noutside Sainsbury's demands, think\nabout it.

    "content": "Sabbaticals FELIX, Friday October 24th19868 Christine: Safety First\nEarly last Sunday morning a woman was attacked and raped in\nthe basement of one of the blocks of\nflats leased by College in Hamlet\nGardens. It is appalling that it takes\nan incident like this to bring to light\nthe lack of security -measures in\nthese student flats. Main doors from\nthe street are unlockable and in\nsome cases missing altogether, and\nthe dark un lit passages and\nstairwells are perfect places for\nintruders to lurk. By the time you\nread this, something should have\nbeen done about these defects; if\nnot, perhaps Hamlet Gardens\nresidents should demand alternative\naccommodation until they feel safe\ngoing to the telephone or to visit\nfriends in their own block.\nMeanwhile there is little we can\ndo to help the situation apart from\noffering commonsense advice to all\nwomen; be alert at all times and\nremember that rape alarms are now\navailable from the Union Office and\nthe Warden's flat in Hamlet\nGardens (121). It makes sense to\ncarry one all the time. Don't feel silly\nasking somebody to go with you\neven to the telephone, stick together,\nand once locking main doors are\nfitted, make sure they stay shut.\nIf you're ever stuck at College and\nworried about getting home, don't hesitate to call Jackie or myself\n(internal 3512 or 3511 respectively),\nthe least we can do is find you a floor\nto sleep on here. If you have to travel\nalone, avoid dark streets and empty\ntrain carriages, sit near the guard or\nconductor and walk near the road to\navoid dark doorways. It is all\ncommonsense really, it's just\nsickening that we do have to be so\nalert and suspicious all the time. Do\ncome and see me if you think we can\ndo anything else or if you just want\nto talk this over.\nWhilst on the subject of security,\nI 've put \" ALARM\" labels on the\nred buttons in the cubicles in the\nUnion Building women's toilets.\nPlease try to avoid setting the alarm\noff accidently or for no real reason,\nthe more false alarms there are, the\nless people will react in a real\nemergency. The same applies to\npersonal alarms, of course. If you're\never in the Union Bar and hear a loud siren, get up those stairs fast as\nit means someone has pressed the\nalarm in the womens toilets or the\nUnion office and needs help.\nU GM The next Union General Meeting is\non Tuesday, November 4 at 1.00pm in the Great' Hall, Sherfield\nbuilding. There will be a speaker,\nDerek Edwards, the Human Rights\nEducation Officer of Amnesty\nInternational. There will also be a collection for Amnesty. Routine\nbusiness will be kept as brief as\npossible to give the speaker a fair\nchance! If anyone does want to\nsubmit a motion to the U GM, give it\nto Dave Colley (Hon. Sec.) or Hugh\nSouthey ( U GM Chair) by\nThursday, October 30.\nChristine\nFed up of Sweating_ then come &-the\nStulerts' Virionthe Hatty'?l*<& drink l snack*it w dk bar and( w fot b*rf* videos * \u00bb music *\u2022 *\nA small tapestry (approximately 10 inch by 12 inch) has been stolen from\nthe Exhibition on level 2 of the Sherfield Building. This tapestry was the\nwork of Valerie Kirk, whose name should be on the back.\nIf anyone has any information about the tapestry, please contact Dr\nHargreaves (3046) or Mr Reeves, College Security Officer (3371).\n( i Insurance\nTop Up\nTake\nCover!\nHello one and all, it's me again and\nmy small rant. The main thing that\ncome to my attention is \"Insurance\nTop Up\". All students who live in\nCollege Accommodation, including\nHead Tenancies, are covered for\nup to a limit of \u00a31,500 worth of\npersonal effects. There is however, a ii mit on certain items such as\ncollections, art pieces and gold items\nof \u00a3150 per item. If you possess\ngoods that total more than \u00a31,500\nthen come and see me in my office. I then ring up the brokers and ask\nthem to quote me a premium, which\nI then tell you. If you accept this,\nyou then write out a cheque for this\namount, made payable to\nAlexander Stonehouse, and when SWv>ta\u00bb<\nthey receive the cheque, the cover is\nstarted.\nAlso, while I'm on the technical\nside of life: 1) Will all drivers of\nUnion vans please use the parking\nplaces marked \"College Vans\nOnly\", as these are our new,\nspecially reserved, spots. They are\nsituated near the guards barrier by\nthe post office, please don't park\nanywhere else. 2) Will all those who\nhave parking permits around the\nSouthside and Linstead area please\nbring their parking permit in to me,\nso I can change them for the correct\npermits, which I have just received.\nNow that's all the dull\nadministrative bit over, it leaves me\nvery little to say, except that in the\nlast issue of FELIX I received a bit\nof as lagging off for upholding the\npublicity rules. The rules are there to\nbe upheld, and if a society breaks the\nrules I will take the persons or\nsociety to the publicity tribunal\nregardless of political persuasion.\nThis, I hope, clarifies anything that\nMr. Ranson said, and I hope that\nopenness of mind will be at the fore\nin future cases.\nOne last note I would like to\nmake; I'm really pleased with the\nchange of atmosphere this year and\neverybody seems to be out to\nsocial is e as well as work. The Union\nbuilding is very well attended both\nduring the day and at night. For this\nwe must thank the increased services\nof Kevin and Norman and their\ncrews of hard working people, and\nalso the efforts of Ents. Remember\nthat events and services are here for\nyou, so do make the most of them.\nD.I. Colley\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday October 24th19867 Benefit Update Welfare Advisor Lesley\nGillingham talks about\nmoney.\nBenefit update 1986/7: The New\nSystem\nHousing Benefit:\nHousing Benefit was set up in 1983\nto enable people on low incomes to\nget help to pay rent and rates. Until\nSeptember 1st1986, practically all\nstudents paying a normal London\nrent were eligible to apply for help\nunder this system, irrespective of\nwhere they lived, unless at the\nparental home.\nOn September 1st the regulations\nconcerning student claims for\nHousing Benefit were changed.\nThere are three major changes to the\nregulations:\na No student living in College owned\naccommodation (Halls and Houses)\ncan claim Housing Benefit in term-time or the two short vacations,\nb The student income will now be\nbased on the full grant taken over 38\nweeks, giving a total weekly income\nof \u00a359.10 for Undergraduate\nstudents. Postgraduates should\ndivide their annual income by 52\nweeks.\nc There will be no reassessment over\nthe short vacation, whatever you\nreceive will be the same for the\nwhole academic year.\nSimple Calculations:\n1. Work out your 'Needs Allowance':\nSingle Person \u00a348.10pw Couple \u00a370.85pw Single Parent \u00a370.85 pw\nEach Dependent Child \u00a314.60pw2. Work out your gross weekly\nincome:\nThe Undergraduate student grant\nworks out at \u00a359.10pw, of which\n\u00a317.10 is disregarded for rent (but\nnot rates) purposes, leaving \u00a341.40.\n3. Work out your weekly rent and\nrates:\nIf your rent includes any amounts\nfor gas or electricity payments,\nmoney will be deducted from your\nrent for these. Maximum deductions\nare approximately \u00a37.00pw in total\nfor heating, lighting, cooking and\nhot water.\nYour rent will then be divided\ninto rent and rates. Rates are usually\ntaken to be 30% of your total rent,\nunless specified.\nTo get the 'eligible' rent figure\nyou must deduct \u00a317.70 from your\nweekly rent. No deductions are\nmade for rate purposes.\n4. Calculate your rebate:\nIf your income is equal to the needs\nallowance:\nRent equals 60% of 'eligible' weekly\nrent,\nRates equals 60% of weekly rates.\nIf your income is less than the needs\nallowance:\nRent equals 60% of 'eligible' weekly\nrent plus 25% of the difference\nbetween income and the Needs\nAllowance,\nRates equals 60% of the weekly rates\nplus 8% of the difference between\nincome and the Needs Allowance\nIf your income is more than the Needs\nAllowance:\nRent equals 60% of the 'eligible\nweekly rent' minus 29% of the\ndifference between income and the\nNeeds Allowance,\nRates equals 60% of the 'eligible'\nweekly rates minus 20% of the\ndifference between income and the\nNeeds Allowance.\nSupplementary Benefit and\nUnemployment Benefit\nOn the 1st September 1986 the\nregulations concerning student\nclaims for supplementary Benefit\nand Unemployment Benefit were\nalso amended.\nSupplementary Benefit\nStudents can no longer claim\nSupplementary Benefit in the two\nshort vacations. They can still claim\nin the longer summer vacations.\nUnemployment Benefit\nAs the 'period of study' is now\nconsidered to be 38 weeks, students\nare no longer 'available for work' in\nthe two short vacations. However, if\nyou fulfill the eligibility requirements you will still be able to\n'sign on' over the summer.\nRemember if you do have any\nquestions or experience difficulties\nwith benefits, call into Student\nServices and see Lesley, the Welfare\nAdviser, or call into the Union on\nWednesday afternoons.\nGlaxo\nCareers with GlaxoBritain's leading\nPharmaceutical Company\nIn order that we maintain this position throughout the World in 1987 we will be seeking\nto recruit up to 7 0 well-qualified graduates and postgraduates (science and arts\ndisciplines) to work in the following key areas of our business:\nResearch and Development (Glaxo Group Research)\nOrganic, Synthetic Chemistry Analytical Chemistry Microbial Biochemistry Chemotherapy Toxicology Neuro pharmacology Cardiovascular Pharmacology Drug Metabolism Regulatory Affairs Information Services Technical Services/Production (Glaxochem)\nAnalytical Chemistry Microbiology Development Chemistry Commercial (Glaxo Pharmaceuticals)\nSales and Marketing Materials Management Finance If you would like to find out more then come and have an informal chat at the Industrial\nSociety Careers Fair in the Sherfield Building on 2 8 October 1986.\n\n"
