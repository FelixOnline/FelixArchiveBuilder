This resulted with the game\nstarting 10 minutes before the\nforwards arrived.\nThis lead on to stage two of\nhis dastardly plot: tire out the\nopposition by getting his players\nto hit the ball in random fashion\nall over the field and leave the\nopposition to fetch it.\nOn to stage 3: The opposition\nwere already disheartened by\ntheir inability to penetrate seven\nmen and were rocked further back\ncn their heels as a further four\nplayers arrived. .However, after\nsome initial tottering, Medhurst\nregained their balance and began\nto play like the league leaders they\nwere.\nThey attacked with gusto,\nusing the breadth of the field, but\nthe IC defence played well and all\ntheir scoring chances were thwarted by demon play from Charlie\nBrown in goal.\nBetween these bouts of pressure the forwards were not only\nadmiring the abilities of the deA C COM MOD ATION FOR1 PERSON5 mins Ravenscourt Park tube,\nshare double room in spacious\nflat for four, breakfast inc., \u00a39 per week. Contact D Hopkins\nMech Eng2. fence, but were actively engaged\nin trying to score goals. They, in\nturn, were aided in this endeavour\nby tenacious and visionary play\nfrom midfield, which provided a constant stream of balls to the\nfront.\nThe forwards tried hard but\nwere often foiled by a lack of cool-headed ness in front of goal. However one attack did produce a score. Mike Isles' snapshot sent\nthe ball sauntering towards their\ngoal. The goalkeeper, flummoxed\nby the insouciant attitude of the\nball, could only let it rebound of\nhis pads to where Trevor Tutu,\nacting with alacrity far beyond any\nhe had shown previously, deposited it in the back of the net.\nThis one goal advantage was\npreserved to give IC its sixth consecutive win taking us to the top\nof the league - a suitable reflection on the new attitude and spirit\nof the side.\nMixed Hockey\nEarly birds forget the worms &\nguzzle Guinness\nIC Mixed XI0 Guinness 2\nIn our usual well-organised\nway we arrived at the opposition\nground at about 1.15pm only\nto find that the place was deserted and that the match\nwas not due to start until\n3.00pm. Guinness were 'unfortunately'\nunable to find enough women\nfor their team and so played\n7 men and4 women. They\nwere also unable to supply\nan umpire, so our bronchi tic captain, Chas Hardy, was volunteered the job. He continually cursed the fact\nthat he was doing more\nrunning about than the players\nthemselves.\nMissed chances\nThe game was fairly even\nwith quite a lot of end-to-end\nplay. Both teams had quite a few scoring chances. Defensive\nerrors from IC enabled Guinness\nto put home two of these. In contrast IC were unable to\nscore even from a range of10 yards.\nThe match was enjoyed by\nall and the serious part of\nthe afternoon came when free\nGuinness and Harp Lager was\nsupplied (in fair quantity)\nafter the game.\nOur team of alcoholics were:-Roger Hutson, John Huckle,\nKim Houlden, Chris Forsyth,\nChris Parker, Rosalind\nBaker, Janet Coxage, Jim\nMarshall', Debra Bean, Pete\nSlowell and Diana Mounsey.\nK.P. Houlden\nBoat Club Coxes needed\nfor repeat\nsuccess story\nWell, here it is, the first\nBoat Club report! Though\nlittle publicised, Imperial\nCollege Boat Club is one of\nthe College's most successful clubs with a long string of\nvictories at all levels to its\nname. Last year we won 20\nevents in VD I's, IV' s and sculls. We put two crews in for Henley Royal Regatta ( in July), and set a new IC record by losing only to the\neventual victors, Harvard ( in the Thames Cup competition).\nWe are currently running two\nVI Us and a lightweight IV. The selection for 1st and 2nd VIIIs\nhas not yet been made and\nif any oarsmen, who haven't come down yet, would like to\non a Wednesday or Saturday\nafternoon they will be more\nthan welcome. Any cox es, or\npeople who would like to learn how to cox, are also much sought after.\nThe lightweight IV is going\nfor International selection in the famous carbon-fibre four,\nhaving already beaten crews of\ncurrent British Internationals.\nWe hope to have another\nsuccessful year and bring\nglory to IC's name once more\nso why not join in?\nPS Women are always\nwelcome, my address is Water-polo Riding Club\nIC 'otters' clinch title\nLAST& FIRST\nIC 10 Otter 2\nThe 1C Water-polo team\nclinched the Middlesex League\nFirst Division Championship\nlast Friday night with a draw to gain the first division title, but gave their home\n'crowd' something to' shout\nwhen their goals tally ran into double figures. The IC team was only promoted to the\nfirst division last year.\nOtter score first\nAs the first quarter got\nunderway there was no\nindication from IC of the\ngoal-scoring spree to follow.\nIndeed, it was the Otter team\nwho scored their two goals\nfirst, although Rory did pull one back before the second\nqua j ter. in the second quarter IC pulled level with a penalty\ntaken by Peter McCartney.\nThen goals from Paul Hindle, Michael McCartney and Cliff Spooner setI C on the road\nto victory. Otter continued to\nplay their fair share of\nattacking water-polo, but Ian\nBales, in goal for IC, was equal Jo any sh of they could\nproduce.\nHat-trick\nIt was in the third quarter,\nhowever, that IC really showed\ntheir superiority. The referee,\nperhaps feeling a little sorry\nfor Otter, twice sent out IC players. In both cases IC replied, while being a man\ndown, with goals from Cliff and Rory. Sh^.tl va f rer Wards Cliff completed his hat-trick.\nFor the final quarter Dave\nLowther was brought into\naction, because Cliff was judged to have inflicted\nenough punishment on the\nopposition. Nevertheless, IC\nextended their lead with\nanother from Michael. To their credit Otter fought\nto the very end and forced Ian\nto produce some dynamic\ngoal keeping. Finally Andy\nSmith marked his return to the\nteam by rounding off the score\nfor IC. Riding Club has competed\nin two University of London League matches this term.\nBoth matches took place at Park Farm Stables in Northwood\nand consisted of a simple dressage test BH S No.6 for\nthe knowledgable followed by a show jumping course.\nThe first of these, (October\n27th) was against Northwood\nRiding Club and Royal Vetinary College First. Here, despite a lot of hard\nwork by Nicki e on the Vicar, Imperial came third.\nA fortnight later and IC were in Northwood again, competing against Kings College and Wye College. This time we did a little\nbetter, bearing both of them;\nthe jumping was the major\nfactor in this decision! The result- for these two matches were:-Wednesday 27th October\n1.

    "content": "2 - FELIX, NOVEMBER f9 th1976 PG Affairs Comer\nThesis going cheap...only \u00a3170 ICWA\nI just knew that I should not have\nmentioned sentence shuffling in my\nprevious literary masterpiece. No sooner\nhad the words been lovingly coerced\nfrom this relic of a typewriter, than the\neditor and his subordinates ruthlessly\nmutilated this onslaught. Just to be on the safe side this is paragraph one.\nAnd so to para two. Doubtless everyone has been harassing Mr Dewey to ask him where the world famous PG piece was last week; (strangely no \u2014 Ed)\nwell you can let him up now. My typewriter is back from its five thousand\nmistake service,s oI can tell you what's \"been happening. A very reduced PG committee met a couple of weeks ago, despite its size, useful discussion ensued helped along by a drop of sherry.\nOne amazing fact which I was able\nto bring to the notice of the committee\nwas a rough figure for the cost of\nproducing a thesis for PhD work. This comes to around \u00a3170, although considerable fluctuations can be expected\ndepending on size and content. I rang\nthe NER C, at their request, to give them\nthis figure and took the opportunity to\nask their views on this matter.\nFaceless excuse\nThe faceless voice at the other end\ntold me that the official view was that\na proportion of the cost was secreted\nin the maintain ance grant each year\nand the student was supposed to save\nthis up. When asked if he believed this\nthe voice sounded less than convinced. I went on to suggest that the amount\nought to be reclaim able in the same way\nas travel expenditure. The voice noted\nthis with the telephonic equivalent of\ninterest, and went off to refer the matter\nto his committee. I intend to make\nsimilar suggestions to the S RC and\nDES. Meanwhile I shall be looking into\nother ways of a levi a ting this burden\nwithin College. Social evening going cheap\nThe other important matter arising\nfrom the meeting was that a social event should be held on the evening of\nthe 25th of November, that's a Thursday.\nIt will take the form of a cheese and\nwine evening costing only 75pa ticket\nand starting at 6.45pm. The venue is as not yet fixed, but watch for posters for further details. Tickets should be\navailable soon from our departmental\ncontacts. It is hoped to provide a disco and a bar.\nMy Public Service bit\nOne disturbing thing about IC is just\nhow easy it is for someone to walk in and steal things. Obviously we don't want security checks on all entrances\nso it's up to us to watch out and be\nsensible. The thefts involve masses of\npersonal belongings and money belonging\nto students as well as office and lab\nequipment. Several simple things can be done to reduce these thefts; 1) Never\nleave cheque books, cash, or credit\ncards in your office, except in locked\ndrawers or cupboards; 2) Whenever\npossible lock all labs and offices when\nthey are unattended even if only for a few minutes; 3) Lock away all small\npieces of valuable equipment when not\nin use (cameras, calculators, etc). When\nin use ensure that calculators are in locked bench frames. 4) Question anyone\nthat you are not familiar with who is\nwandering in or near your lab or office\narea.\nI hops that we can thus reduce the cost and inconvenience of thefts both\nto the college and individuals.\nAnd thus in fact ends the article. UL UP G Committee will be discussing the effects of the proposed fee increases\non London PG s and I shall be reporting\non this soon. In t fie meantime don't forget to watch out for more details of\nthe great PG Party.\nRick Parker\nPG Affairs Officer\nSince there has been a lack of\nsupport and a number of complaints\nabout the difficulty of the treasure hunt\nI 'll give a further (and final) hint that\nthe capital in question is not escu does... I will allow a further weeks grace\nfor answers. Anybody who has sent in an answer and now feels it may be\nincorrect, can send in a second attempt.\nHowever, the second answer will be\ncounted (even if the first answer had\nbeen right j L The second clue is: Men and Women showing reverence to\nsuperiors or the English Archers at\nAgin Court perhaps.\nThe answers to both clues( and 20p) to reach room 98 Beit Hall by Thurs\n(25th) by lunchtime.\nI feel I should point out that the first\nthree clues are to help find the treasure\nfor which the \"treasure hunt\" clue will be the fourth and final one. Good luck to\nall who enter.\nCongratualtions to all our newly\nelected committee:-Madeleine Scott \u2014 Hon. Sec. PadU ne Day \u2014 Treasurer\nEileen McAuliffe Life Sciences Rep.\nArlene Frances \u2014 Mines Rep\nAt present the only contested post is\nof Mr ICWA and elections for him will take place later today.\nDespite rumours to the contrary there\nis definately going to be a Easter Ball' and it should be quite a bit cheaper than\nany other Balls!!! ICWA will also be having a Christmas luncheon on Tue s14 th Dec which should be quite a festive\nevent; but more details later.\nIsobel Donnelly\nIC RADIO\nWanted: One medium wave transmitter on loan for tests until our own transmitters\nare built. An opportunity to use your transmitter legally \u2014 no questions asked. Contact IC Radio via the Union office or\ninternal 2429.\nHow much is YOUR company losing?\nHugh Barrett looks at the NUS service companies\nAn important point to bear in mind\nwhen discussing NUS Services is that\nthey are our services who, through NUS\nconference, are accountable to us.\nTravel\nNUS Travel (NUST) have had cont\nside r able difficulties over the last few\nyears, essentially due to a lack of\ncapital. Last year _they lost almost\n\u00a3300,000 (on a \u00a36.5M turnover) and are\nset to lose over \u00a3100,000 this year.\nDrastic economies and other measures\nhave had to be introduced to combat\nthese losses, viz35 redundancies and\nthe introduction of a new top man ag ment team. These measures will hopeful y produce a break even situation in two\nyears time, and an opportunity to pay\noff the accumulated deficit over the\nfollowing years.\nNUS will not pay any of its income\nfrom subscriptions to any service company, so cash, to tide NU ST over\nthis period, has been injected from an outside concern , the Australian NU ST. Endsleigh Insurance is in a much\nhealthier financial position; estimated\nprofits this year will be around \u00a3150,000.\nThe bulk of this stems from the great\nsuccess of the 6-month car insurance\nscheme. This accounts for 45% of End sleigh's income. End sleigh are helping\nNUS in their financial difficulties by\npurchasing their tax losses. So, instead\nof paying corporation tax to the Government, Endsleigh are putting money into\nN UST.A rather cute accounting fiddle\nI think!\nPrinting\nEndsleigh Printing (Photomech and\nUniprint) are also in financial trouble\nfor basic aly the same reasons as travel.\nThey have a projected combined loss of\n\u00a372,000. Steps are being taken to\nremedy this and I think that they are\nsu cee ding. A cloud on the horizon, however, is\na decision by the National Graphical Association( who form a closed shop'at\nPhoto me ch) to only accept business if\nthe artwork has been done by NGA members. Since a lot of Photomech's trade is with students and their unions,\nwho normally do their own artwork, the\ncompany could be badly affected.\nThere is, though, good news from\nNUS Marketing, a new company, which\nis expanding rapidly. This year it has already notched up sales of \u00a3200,000.\nA financial breakdown (!) is not yet\navail i ble, but I suspect that initial cost\nof setting up the company, will balance\nthis year's 'profits'.\nThe discount card has been a massive\ns uc ses s. By the way if you cannot\nobtain a discount at a store which is\nlisted in the discount handbook, and\nyou have a discount card, you should\nwrite direct to NUS who will refund the\namount of discount you have lost and\ntake the matter up with the store\ninvolved.\nOn a happier line, John Menzies\nhave joined the scheme and are now\noffering a70% discount to students.\nFollowing last week's open External\nAffairs meeting, we have submitted\namendments to NUS motions on Welfare,\nHousing, NUS Constitution, NUS Services, Grants and Cuts and South Africa. These motions, if prioritized, will be composite d and, hopefully, returned to the Union in\ntime for them to be discussed at the\nUGM on December 2nd. Here we will be\nable to mandate our delegates to NUS Conference.\n\n"

The only dissident is Thames. The aim of the directive -is to\nreduce overseas numbers from\n25% to 10% by 1982 - that is, from 8,400 to 3,400.\nContrary to the directive,\nP NL has increased its overseas intake by 50, PCL by 4 6 ,\nand there have been comparable\nincreases at City and South\nBank.\nDefending the defiance,\nProfessor Yarwood of PCL said he regarded the education\nof overseas students as a substantial contribution to the\noverseas aid programme.\n(McGarel)\nLeeds Union Purge\nTwo members of the\nUniversity Union Executive Committee at Leeds were\nthrown out of office this month.\nA motion of no confidence\nwas passed against Alison Young, the House Secretary,\nLiz Colvin, the Education\nSecretary.\nPresident Brian Smith,\nprosecuting, siad that the\ntwo secretaries had 'neglected\nall their responsibilities': defending, Ms Young said that\nthey had been ill, and suggested\nthat the motion was in\nretaliation for an earlier\nmotion by herself.\n(Leeds Student)\nLeeds Rag in shreds\nWith less' than a fortnight\nto go before Rag Week, Leeds'\nrag organization has been\nsplit at the seams by the\nresignation of three senior rag\nofficers in protest at the\nchairman's incompetence.\n(Leeds Student)\nSheffield 'Sinking Ship'\nOver the past week, eight\nExecutive Committee members\nhav.e resigned in disillusion ment, at Sheffield Union.( Dart) Andrew Evans\nxe.?& THUR5T3AY,\n(US*?\nKi.60 on. lie I3^9 Af?

It was a game\nfull of incident and excitement\nand one which, saw some\nspirited rugby from both sides. LSE were delighted to score\ntwo tries within fifteen minutes.\nThe first came from their right\nwinger, who beat the defence\nwith some elusive running\nand the second followed good\nsupport work that created an\noverlap on the left. Both were\nconverted.\nIC strike back\nIc rallied and were rewarded\nby a beautifully struck\npenalty from Cotter. Two minutes later the forwards\nworked the ball back from a maul and Gibbs unselfishly\nput Gregory in for a try.\nThe game at this stage was\nopen and fluid, with some\ncommendable tackling and covering.\nLater on a spate of good\nline-out play enabled Robins and Turely to take the ball to\nwithin a yard of the line. The ensuing ruc k was fast and\nferocious. The LSE back row\ntried to kill the ball, but the\nhalf-backs were able to\nhandle quickly and enabled\nGilbert dive over for his first\nscore of the season.\nInstead of consolidating\ntheir position, IC lost con-cent ration, something which\nhas caused problems in the\npast, and the 1 lead was snatched away from them as\nLSE scored a try on the\nstroke of half time.\nAfter the interval Robins \u2014\ntroubled by an ankle injury \u2014\nwas forced to leave the field. This, and some extraordinary\ndecisions \u2014 or rather lack of\nthem \u2014 concerning infringements at both ruc k and maul,\nintroduced a degree- of frustration into the game. Several\npunches were thrown and much\nof the play was bad-tempered\nduring this period.\nMarching Orders\nMatters came to a head,\nhowever, when the IC2 nd row\nSteve Asp den, was seen raking\nan LSE player at arc uk. His instant dismissal to the\ndressing room made him the\nfirst Imperial College l st XV player to be sent off in five\nyears.\nThe final thirty minutes\nwere an enormous test of\ncharacter for the team. The forwards drove themselves and fought for every ball, contesting both sc rummage and line-out, with conviction. Having\nwithstood intense pressure, IC broke out of defence and from\na badly mis-cued 25 yard\ndrop out Heath chipped ahead,\nGibbs gathered the ball and\nGregory fought through a tackle and squeezed over in the corner for a tremendous\ntry.\nThis was truly the turning\npoint of the game, it encouraged\nthe pack to battle on, and\nCotter kicked another penalty\nbefore further pressure on the\nLSE line produced a try for\nWest on the left wing. The final whistle was blown\nimmediately after the conversion attempt faded past the\nleft hand upright,\nEarned reputation\nIn winning by 22\u201412 IC have provided themselves with\nthe platform needed for the\nfixtures to come against some\nof the best club sides in London.

    "content": "Rag WeekF E LIX, NOVEMBER19 th19765 Friday - Guilds Carnival\nAlways one of the highlights of IC Rag Week is the Guilds\nAll Night Carnival, this year scheduled for Friday, 26th November.\nLast year's extravaganza featured the whimsical talents of\nthe drunken Viv Stanshall, Rodger Ruskin Spear and Andy\n'Thunderclap' Newman.\nThis year the Guilds Ents Committee have chosen a line-up\nof artists that give the event a more rock oriented feel. Headlining the bill will be top Welsh band Sassafras. After gigging\nup and down the country at clubs, colleges and supporting\nmajor rock acts at top venues, the band have now earned a strong, healthy following. The present line-up is Terry Bennett,\nRicky John Holt, Dai Shell, Ralph Evans and Bob 'Congo'\nJones.\nThey have maintained their base in Cardiff where they\nbegan with Dai and Ralph \u2014 a long-standing guitar playing\npartnership \u2014 who teamed up with bass player Ricky John and\nformer Love Sculpture drummer Congo Jones. They worked\nfor a year, split up, and then reformed in ' 7 3 , adding Bennett\nto their line-up.\nAlthough basically a hard-hitting rock band, Sassafras have\nbeen influenced by the West Coast sound, and distinct references to the country bands like the Burritos and Eagles can be\nheard in their music. Certainly a band that you shouldn't miss.\nSupporting Sassafras will be folk singer Alan White and\nrock band the Foster Brothers. I must admit I know little of the\ntalents of Mr. White. However, I can tell you that the Foster\nBrothers are a raunchy goodtime band, that have been playing\nthe London pub circuit for a long time under the name of\nBlitz. They are now concentrating more on Colleges and small\nhalls.\nThere will also be a disco on throughout the evening.\nAs a contrast to the live music, two films will be shown\nduring the evening. They are the brilliant 'Loot', and the much\nacclaimed Take the Money and Run', both of which should\nprove excellent entertainment.\nTo round things off, food will be provided throughout the\nevening and most important of all the Union Bar and Lounge\nwill be serving drink until 3 a.m.! All this and more can be enjoyed at the very reasonable\nprice of \u00a3 1 . 9 0 in advance (from C&G Union Office) or \u00a3 2 . 2 0\non the door. Everyone is welcome to join in the festivities, so\nwhy not go along and enjoy yourselves.\nTomorrow - Ralph McTell\nBorn in December 1944 (Saggitarious with Saggitarious\nRising), Ralph Mc Tell was brought up in post war London by his\nmother,, He had a grammar school education prior to spending\nfive months in the Army. He then bought his release and went to\nCollege, where he scraped a few ' O' levels, an ' A' level in Art, and purchased his first guitar. This was followed by jobs such as\ngardening, construction site work and as a waiter.\nThen came a period of playing his guitar on the streets of\nEurope. In Paris1965 he met his future wife, Nanna, who\ncollected money whilst Ralph played the queues.\nIn 1966,after his return to England, he played his first prof ess ional gigs, (while also a part-time porter). About this time\nRalph started song writing. In November of that year he wrote\nhis classic 'Streets of London'. He began regular work in folk\nclubs during 1968 and soon emerged as a hero on the College circuit. From there he progressed to tour first America, and then\nEurope, selling out all the way. In 1974 he became the first one-man performer to fill the Royal Albert Hall to capacity in 14 years.\nRalph Mc Tell's fourth Album for Warner Brothers Right Side\nUp has just been released. The tracks include 'Weather the\nStorm', his new single, as well as two beautiful songs from a couple of his contemporaries, John Martyn's 'May You Never',\nand Tom Waites 'San Diego Serenade'.\nRalph is playing a few selected concert appearances before\nChristmas to promote the album. These include Imperial College on the 20th November, tickets for which are available from the\nIC Ents Committee Office at lunch times. Prices are \u00a31.60 (\u00a31.50\nto IC students) in advance, and \u00a31.70 on the door.\nThis promises to be one of the greatest concerts of the term.\nBill Heckley\nEnts Chairman\nThursday - Smoking\nConcert\nLock up your daughters, 'cause this Thursday sees the\nannual RCS Smoking Concert. In blunt terms it is 'a smutty\nversion of what a college revue should be' (John White) i.e.3 hours of filth, obscenity and bawdy wit(?). In fact it is so good\nthat even Miners and Guildspersons pay 50p to get in.\nSo much for the promo; I can't tell you much more 'cause\nthe bulk of the sketches are written the night before, a fact\nthat greatly enhances the literary content of the show.\nAs you will have gathered from the graphic pictures in the\nRCS Handbook(?), Smoking Concert is the students' chance to\nget their own back on the lecturers, throw mud at the\nExecutive (all 4 of them?\u2014Ed) and relieve thier sexual\nfrustrations.\nIf you are in RCS then act in your year sketch, it's great\nfun and a free barrel goes to the winners. If you are in Mines\nor Guilds then come and watch you own execs., in their guest\nsketches. (Quite honestly \u2014 I think you'll \u2014 Mines and Guilds\nthat is \u2014 be more turned on by the stripper or drag artist . . .\ndepending on your fancy of course!)\nSteve Braund\nConcerts Preview\n\n"

    "content": "4 - FELIX, NOVEMBER19 th1976 Ins and outs of the WELFARE\nRent Act\nThe Rent Act is often cited as the\nreason for the shortage of accommodation\nin London. It was introduced to give more\nrights to the tenant, but does it help you?\nThere are different classes under the\nAct, such as resident and non-resident\nlandlords. Firstly, I will consider the\ncase where you have a resident landlord.\nAs they are resident they take advantage\nof a special dispensation in the Act which removes your right to security of\ntenure unless the accommodation is a purpose built block of flats when the exemption does not necessarily apply. A lodger or tenant with a resident landlord\nhas the right to have a rent fixed by a Rent Tribunal unless you have food\nprovided and this forms a substantial\npart of the rent.\nIf you have a non-resident landlord it\nis probable that you have a_ regulated\ntenancy. However there are, of course,\nexemptions such as Halls of Residence. Regulated tenants have security of\ntenure and the rents are subject to Rent\nregulation, whether the property be\nfurnished or unfurnished. As a tenant you\nhave security of tenure even when your\ntenancy expires; you do not have to leave unless the courts grant an order\nof possession against you. Unfortunately the Act is slightly vague\nso each case has to be taken' on its own\nmerits; if you have any problems with\nyour accommodation please contact the\nWelfare Centre, 3rd Floor, of the Union Building. Sxetutiue\nWelcome once again to the literary\ncentre-point of FELIX!! Before I delve\n\u2022into a couple of matters of current\ninterest, let me say me efforts are' ampere d( pun) by factual inna curacies in FELIX. Last week's issue contained\nthree which I should like to correct:\n(i) The College' Refectory Committee\ndid not decide to recommend that\nrefectory prices remain at their present\nlevel after Christmas. Wh^t they did decide was that they would not make a recommendation until further discussion by IC Union\nWelfare officer\nJohn Morgan\nSuicide discussion evening\nNigntline and the Union Welfare are\ncombining to organise a discussion on\nSuicide. Suicide is a subject normally\ntalked about in embarrassed, hushed\nwhispers. It is a problem of our present\nsociety and understanding it .goes a long\nway to its cure.\nThere is going to be an open meeting\ntitled ' Suicide, to do or not to do.' on Wednesday December 1st at 19.00 hours\nin Mech Eng220. The discussion will be led by Jean Burt, the joint General\nSecretary of the Samaritans.\nIt is hoped that the evening will remove many of the myths surrounding\nsuicide. It is also hoped that you will become aware of the problem and how\nyou can assist. Legal Service\nThe legal service on Wednesday\nafternoons provided by law students\nfrom the London. School of Economics will next be on1 st December in the\nWelfare Centre (located on the third floor\nof the Union Building. If you have any\nurgent legal queries please contact the\nWelfare Centre any Junchtime between\n12.30 and 13.30 hours .as it is possible to consult a solicitor on your behalf.\nhad taken place on the Committee, and\nthe result of that discussion will be\nforwarded to the Governors in December,\n(ii) In the overseas- students article it\nsays that the proposals were welcomed\nby- me. Quite true, not only were they\nwelcomed by me, they were suggested by\nme after a paper given to me by Pete Teague (President ICU'7576). PRES\nCUTTINGS\nby IC Union\nPresident\nNick Brayshaw\n(iii) In the misinformed tome from Steve\nWilliams concerning the Discount Card scheme he says \" we will be unable to\nsell our cards to the students from our\ncollege because they will just go to\nImperial\". What a load of bull, because\nwe agreed quite explicit y that we would\nonly sell the cards to members of ICU and no other colleges. Here now is your chance to earn\nsome money:\nCashier in the Refectory. The Union\nRefectory is in need of another cashier in order to reduce the queues which\ndevelop each lunchtime. The going\nrate is about \u00a31 /hour and the job would\nbe a couple of hours each lunchtime,\nie nearly \u00a310 per week. Anyone interested\n(and honest), then come and see Nick Brayshaw in the Union. Refectory Questionnaire. Last week I mentioned that the Union is to conduct a survey on \"what the customer wants\", in order, to get a good response we intend paying people to stand in the\nref ect s and ask people to answer the\nquestions, ie do a bit of market research.\nRates \u00a3 l/ hour, free pen and clipboard\nsupplied \u2014 see Nick Bray shaw. No more news, but see next week's article for the next star bargains.\nORANGE\nMOLE\nby IC Union\nDeputy President\nDerrick Everett\nThere have recently been\na number of incidents where\nstudents have conducted\nthemselves 1na less than\ncommendable fashion. Increased\nrowdiness in Stan's bar is a matter on which many people\nhave commented, and seems\nmostly to involve individuals\nbanned from the Union bar.\nFurther to this, let me\nremind you that being on the\nUnion roof, without permission\nfrom myself, is a disciplinary offence, and drinking parties\non the roof are most definitely\nnot on.\nNoticeboards\nUnion Building\nSocieties noticeboards are\nplaced:-(i) Outside Ents room\n(ii) outside Bar\n(iii) by telephones\nGeneral not ice boards:\n(i)3 in lower -lou h ge( orange\nmaterial)\n(ii) outside Union Office\n(iii) by and opposite photo-booth - (mostly earmarked for\naccommodation, lifts, jobs etc)\nOfficial noticeboards:\n(i) Executive, Council and External Affairs Committee\nnoticeboards; all in lower\nlounge.

Not SO bright ff lH Ii Procession on despite squabbles\nEx R CSU President Steve\nBrightman escaped unhurt\nwhen his car crashed into the\nMechanical Engineering building last Friday night.\nThe accident happened at\naround 11.30pm, when Mr\nBrightman's yellow Dolomite\nSprint was travelling from the\nSherfield Building towards\nMechanical Engineering. The car failed to negotiate the\nright hand bend at Mech Eng. It struck the ker b, turned on its side and then ploughed\ninto three windows on level\none of the engineering\nbuilding.\nThere was no fire, and the\noccupants of the car, Mr\nBrightman and Dave Nicks on, emerged uninjured but shaken\nfrom the battered vehicle. Estimates vary greatly as\nto the cost of the damage to\nthe car and building. Mines President Paul Kurowski this week refused to streak\naround the Albert Hall to raise Rag funds. He said it lowers the.\nlowers the image of RSM. Perhaps some others, who could raise\nthe standard should accompany him.\nRCS Rag totals up\nRCS Union this week\nsurpassed their last year's total for money collected for\nRag. They did so whilst selling Rag Mags to those on Wednesday's NUS/ TUC 'Fight the\nCuts' march.\nR CSU have now collected \u00a31,583 for Rag this year, \u00a380\ngreater than last year's total.\n\u00a3100 of the total came from\nRag Mag sales on Wednesday.\nThe march was the biggest\nindustrial demonstration in London in recent times. Over\n40,000 people attended,\nincluding some 35 or so from\nIC Union. Demonstrators\nreacted quite well to the Rag Mag sellers, although ex-IC\nPresident Trevor Phillips jested 'Why don't you come\ninto line with the rest of us'.\nMascots\nThe University College mascot Phineas was returned\nby Guilds to UC at the C& GU bar night on Sunday.\nThe mascot was transferred\nat about 10pm, although UC students arrived at the Union\nbar by 8pm. They joined, but\nwere unsuccessful, in the\nGuilds bar night festivities. Rag off?\n-No way!\nThis year's Rag Procession is to go ahead as announced\nin last week's FELIX. This was agreed, after much intra-CCU squab ling and petty recriminations, at a Carnival\nCommittee meeting on Wednesday evening.\nThe Procession will be waved off by the Rector and\nLady Flowers tomorrow morning.\nAlthough an affirmative\ndecision was reached, at one\nstage a section of the meeting\nalmost swung opinion to the\ncontrary.\nLack of arrangements\nLed by Chris Morrel, R CSU President, this conclave complained bitterly about the\narrangements made for the\nProcession and the fact that\nonly two twenty-foot lorries\nwere available to carry four\nfloats on the Procession. 'With only two lorries we're\ngoing to be the laughing stock\nof Kensington,' Miss Morrel\nclaimed. John Kearns, last\nyear's Rag Chairman, answered\nher by pointing out that Queen\nElizabeth College, only had\nthree lorries on their (very\nsuccessful) Rag Procession last year.\nThe R CSU disappointment\nwas heightened since they\nhave gone to great lengths to\nobtain float that led the\nLord Mayor's Procession last\nSaturday. This features a large robin, a moment o to Sir Robin Gil let the new Lord Mayor.\nR CSU later urged everyone\nto get as many vehicles and people as possible dressed up and out on the Procession. The meeting began' degen-e rating, due to lack of\npositive chairing by Martin\nJud kin s, the Rag Chairman.\nIt took a rallying call of\n'Let's do the best with what\nwe've got' by John White,\nICU Hon Sec, to restore order\nto the meeting and sympathy\nto this year's Procession arrangements.\nRag Felix\nMore wrangling ensued over\nthe question of a special Rag edition of FELIX.

    "content": "FELIX, NOVEMBER19 th19769 JUST FYNGYR LYKYN'\nGOOD\nAfter four excellent studio LPs, with\nonly a couple of dud tracks between\nthem, it was on the cards that a I ive\nalbum, in the vein of a' Best of, would\nbe recorded, trying to capture them in their ture state, (sorry) a Southern Rock\nBoogie Band. What an absolute* gem it is too.\nIt speeds along at a terrific rate,\nopening with a rocking plug for their\nrecording company, 'Workin for MCA',\nthen straight \u2022 into, 'I Ain't the One',\nslowing in pace only for such tasteful\nnumbers as 'Tuesday's Gone', 'Sweet\nHome Alabama' and 'Needle and the\nSpoon'.\nThe climax to the album is the very\nlast track, the brilliant, 'Free Bird',\nwhich starts off with the tinkling guitar\nfrom Allen Collins, and the gravel voiced\nvocals of Ronnie Van Zan t, who is eventually swamped under by the\nblistering guitar work of the three lead\nguitarists, namely Collins, Garry\nRossington and Steve Gains. The last of\nthese makes his recording debut on this\nalbum.\nOut of the fourteen tracks on this double album, there are only three which weren't previously available on record,\nie 'T tor Texas', a 'Skydnerdysed'\nversion of the country classic by Jimmie\nRodgers,'Travellin'Man' and 'Crossroads',\nall are destined to be Skynyrd Favourites. The thing that makes Lynyrd Skynyrd\nso good, for me, is their unpretentious\napproach to rock; they give a rock\nhungry audience exactly what it wants,\nraunchy, hard hitting numbers, that\nmake you wan'na move your feet, and sing along. This album gives you\nexactly that. I 've seen them live three\ntimes, and this is the closest recording\nto how Skynyrd really are \u2014 mean and\nbasic. I thought of writing 'It you've not\nbeen turned on tb Lynyrd Skynyrd yet,\nthis is the album to do it. It doesn't make the previous LPs obsolete because\nthere are so many excellent tracks not\ngiven a look in on this one. 'One more\nfrom the Road', should be in every\nSkynyrd fans' record collection, as I am\nsure it will be'. But I thought better ot\nit. Still the LP's terrific.\nHorslips at Imperial College Great Hall\nI was thinking of walking out half-way\nthrough Hors lips' set; but then I got bored and fell asleep. I awoke to find\nthe band engrossed in some delightful\nIrish (folk) jigs. Both the band and the capacity\naudience came to enjoy themselves, and\nneither left disappointed. Well that just\ngoes to show how subjective a review\ncan be.\nOne can't fault Hors lips technically, but I found them at times rather self, indulgent, particularly during 'The First\nMovement ot the Gaelic Symphony?\nNevertheless, when they did start playing\ntheir folk/ rock jigs they became terrific\ncrowd inspire rs. The band are fairly talented, especial ly\ntheir violinist and keyboard player.\nThese two give the and a very traditional\nIrish identity, which raises them above\nother bands in the foot-shuffling rock\nidiom.\nDespite an energetic performance\nall-round I can remember seeing better\nHors lips \"concerts a tIC. Still, they\nwere right for a good hop at the end.\nClive Dewey\nRalph McTell in concert\nSaturday 8pml i iei if Hm\nTickets from Ents Office\nNIGHTLINE 581-2468\nINTERNAL 2468\n6pm9 am Every Day\nSomeone to talk to...\n...and information\nWANT TO WIN TWO TICKETS TO THE IC ENTS'\nThe questions\n1.

    "content": "8 - FELIX, NOVEMBER19 th1976 Lord Mayor's Show report\nand a good time was had by all\n4.30am Saturday morning loomed early (for a change) and so I set about joining two or three other hardy individuals in the dark\nand freezing cold of Mines quad to polish up our (loaned) file-engine for the Lord Mayer's Show. At6.30, the engine gleaming\nlike a new pin, so the crew returned to Southside for breakfast.\nMy thanks to Tina Pearson and Sandra for so ably doing the\neggs and bacon, and also to Mssrs Hall, Reditt, Dodge, Q ill ett, Cox, Mattback for helping polish the engine and for working so\nhard helping generally with getting the show on the road. \u2022\nAbout 7.00 we left for. London Wall; it dawned as we raced\npast Buckingham Palace klaxon screaming, bell ringing, and all shouting \" Fire\". But we didn't get a stately two-fingers from\nany of the windows.\n10 minutes after we arrived at London Wall, soaking wet and\nfreezing cold, up rode Guilds in ' Bo, looking similarly the worse\nfor wear. In fact ' Bo nearly got flattened by a tank transporter\nbut fortunately the army driver missed. About 9.00 the rest of the floats arrived and were closely followed by the RCS contingent, led by Chris Morrell arid A de Sudworth. By10.30 we were ready for the off, and away we went\n(restraining Chris from attacking the Vikings on an adjacent\nfloat:' He' s got a lovely,chopper!!'\nI have never seen so many people in my life, everybody cheering and waving. It was an amazing sight, especially with all the\nkids there.\nJ ez( Mark II) and Bo both got excellent receptions due to the\nstudents trying to get the crowd involved in the show rather than\njust standing watching.^ _\nAs we come up to St Paul's, Bo' suffered a blow-out (leaving\na three-quarter inch hole in a tyre, which will cost about \u00a350 to\nrepair) and was unable to continue in the procession.\nJust after that Nick Gil let (son of the\nnew Lord Mayor and our own RCS TV star) managed to get\ninterviewed by the BBC. The interviewer nearly broke his neck\nclimbing on the engine, but thats another story.\nAfter lunch at King's College we finished the second half of\nthe procession (we all had 'stately-wavers elbow' by this time)\nand then piled back to college. As you may have seen, were you in Southside at the time, RCS decided to give a fire-fighting display and connected the engine\nup to a fire-hydrant, putting 100,000 gallons^a minute on to the\nHawthorn tree (This answers all the people who are wondering\nwhere the leaves went).\nAgain I feel special thanks must be due to RCS Motor Qlub\nfor arranging the loan and J ez( Mk II) from Dennis Motors \"and to\nNick Gil let for keeping my head above water with respect to a lot of what goes on in the Lord Mayor's Show.\nSteve Braund\n. . . pss sst.... want\nto travel to Europe\nand save up to 50%\noff normal rail fares?\ngo\nTRANS AL PINO EUROPA RAIL That's right - you save up to 50% off normal rail; fares\nwhen you get your tickets from Transalpino.
