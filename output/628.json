    "content": "ICLUBS & SOCIETIES!\nRSM\nI hope everyone enjoyed their day down in\nCardiff and it was good to see that we taught\nthem a bit about singing songs and boat races\n(to the extent they had to start cheating!).\nThanks very much to everyone who helped\nout at the Open Day. The students who\nattended all seemed to think it was well\nworthwhile.\nNames are now being taken for the Mines\nBall (Dec 17). Tickets are \u00a328 (for a double)\nand although that might sound expensive it\nincludes a four course meal, cabaret, disco and\nbars. We will accept post-dated cheques (till\nnext term) so get your name down to the\nUnion Office now.\nI suppose there are not many of you out there\nwho are aware that the RS M possesses a motorised mascot, but let me assure you that\nClementine, a1926 Morris Commercial, is\nvery much alive.\nC lem is at present being rebuilt, having been\nrolled (yes, rolled!) some years ago. At that\ntime, C lem was stripped, chucked into boxes,\nand distributed all over College for restoration\nwork.\nUnfortunately, nobody bothered to record\nwhere all the pieces went, and we have been\nleft with the frustration of a jigsaw, with\nnumerous unaccountable missing pieces.\nPlease, if anybody knows where any of the\npieces are, or any bits of scrap which may be\nuseful, let me know, or drop a line into the\nRS M Union Office.\nFinally if anybody is interested in helping out\nwith the rebuilding of C lem just get in touch.\nThe club meets every Wednesday in the RS M Union Office at 1:00pm. Much ta.\nJohn Eagleson\nC&G Last Friday Guilds Carnival was a great\nsuccess with everyone having a great, fantastic\nmarvellous, space r, etc, time. Thanks to all\nthose who arranged it and helped to make it\none of the best ever.\nThe C& GU/ Operation Drake float went\ndown well at the Lord Mayors Show last\nSaturday, despite the fact that all the\nGuildsfolk were still suffering from Carnival's excesses.\nEnough of the past\u2014now to the forthcoming\nGuilds spectaculars.\nThis Saturday (November 20) we have Silly\nSports outside Harrods. This is one of the\nmost enjoyable Rag events of the year and is\nwhere Guildsfolk impress (?) the Harrods\ncustomers with their amazing acrobatic and\nidiotic skills and then ask for/demand large\nsums of money for charity. Meet in the Guilds\nOffice at 9:00am this Saturday.\nAnd finally for those of you who suffer from\nthe midweek blues we have on Wednesday\nNovember 24: Morohv Day, on which we take\non RCS and Mines in a battle for the Morphy\nOar. Traditional ammunition consisting ot\nbulls blood, rotting eels, guts, etc. Traditional\narmour in pink (mmm-nice) bin-liners. All cavalry, artillery and foot soldiers meet in the\nGuilds Office at 12:30pm from where we will\nmarch down to Putney towpath and let battle\ncommence (after the rowing races). Cream\nteas will be served in Harrods for all survivors\nand those agile enough to escape Harrods'\nsecurity guards.\nSee you at the above events.\nJules\nBookshop News\nThank you all for supporting our exhibition of\nbooks from Russia.

One of my sex\npili came away in her long nailed hand.\nShuddering with pain I lashed out with my\nflagella, striking the woman across the head\nand chest. She staggered backwards and I pressed in on the offensive, firing both R and F plasmids at her now bleeding wounds.\n\" No!\" she gasped, \"You'll only make it\nworse for yourself. Run while you still have the\nchance!\"\nFor then it was that I heard the ominous\nthrobbing noise coming from behind me. With\na bias random walk I turned around and faced\nmy foe. Ah, yes!

Right, on with the\ncolumn.\nSome of you may have noticed the temporary disappearance of the Southside TV Lounge set last week. This was for modi fic a tion, or rather re indoctrination, as your friendly cathode ray tube was beginning to\nhave ideas of its own. At one point the set\nrefused to automatically switch to STOIC transmissions when commanded. A retraining\ncourse was obviously necessary, and after a few hours under the scalpel of Oberengineeringfuhrer Nick W Graham-Taylor, the Philips\nGil returned to an existence as free from\noriginal thought as the J CR set.\nIf any of you, whilst passing your free time\nwatching STOIC's hybrid waveforms notice\nany slight variation from technical perfection\ngives us a bell on internal 2637 and we'll send\nthe boys round.\nOn a lighter note, we wish Martin S Taylor\nthe best of luck with his fight against the\ntyrannical cos pir( aha!

    "content": "3 PORT\n^ Hockey\nISPORTI\nFirsts\nIC vs Goldsmiths I41 This was a crucial first round of\nthe U LUC up played against a team determined to show IC how lucky we were to draw with\nthem last season 1-1. Played on a smooth H arlington A pitch Imperial failed to stamp any\nauthority on the game during the\nfirst half-hour allowing ' Goldy s' a free run of the pitch culminating in a nicely finished\ngoal. A goal down, Imperial\nstarted to show a little more\naggression and soon fought back\nto draw level before half time.\nIn the second half Imperial\nstarted to control the game with\n9 0 % of the play and soon converted some fluent moves\ninto three more goals from Geoff, Andy and Paul ensuring\nImperial a sound win and a second round place in the Cup. Team: Bell, Ayres, Franklin,\nRiley, Parker, Bawal, Jones,\nPaul, Andy, Walter, Garmes.\nIC vs Gowan 1-0\nGo wan,a team from a division\nabove our own, were a skilful\nside. Weakened, starting with\nten men, Imperial applied good\nopening pressure with Andy Garmes doing some good running out wide on the left wing\nswinging in some good balls for\nBell to neatly miss leaving a scoreless sheet at half time. The\nsecond half saw a very close\nbattle, especially in midfield with\nboth sides creating good chances\nbut failing to convert them to\ngoals. However, with about ten\nminutes to go Garmes slotted a Bansal cross into the net leaving\nImperial to survive a final ten\nminute onslaught before progressing to the second round of\nthe Middlesex Cup. Team: Sean, Barry, Geoff,\nSteve, Chris, Jones, Andy, Paul,\nAndy G, Mangat and Walter.\nIC vs Brunei 4-0\nYet another sound victory in the\ndivision against a useful but\ndisjointed Brunei side. Imperial\ncreated all the chances in the\nfirst half but the forwards failed\nto convert these to goals and by\n| half time it was still a scoreless\nmatch.\nHowever, in the second half\nImperial played some of their\nbest hockey with Andy and Chris holding the defence together well and Captain Geoff\ncontrolling the midfield distributing the ball out to right wing\nMangat who put some nice deep\nfirst time crosses through the\nBrunei defence resulting in a hattrick for Bell and a rare Steve\nParker goal \u2014 much to the\ndelight of his girlfriend. (It's funny how he seems to move\nupfield whenever she's around?)\nIf Imperial can keep scoring like\nthis\u2014and keep a tight defence\u2014\nhow can we lose?\nSeconds\nIC vs Mill Hill 0-1\nWith IC all ill, Against a team like Mill Hill, We were never going to win.\nThe pitch was so bad,\nAgain Purdy got mad,\nAnd Slatter let their goal in. Between his legs went the ball,\nSuch a surprise to us all.\nOh Rolf, what a terrible sin!\nCharles missed a sitter,\nAnd Dave did not better.\nWhen he tried kicking it in.\nNo Hope couldn't score,\nHe missed the target for sure,\nAnd so all four chances were\nblown.\nLadies\nIC vs Chelsea College II 2-0\nLocality: Somewhere south of\nthe Thames in a whorehouse\nVisitor: Ivor Cock Condition of surface to be\nnegotiated: Somewhat lumpy and soggy, probably due to\nconstant use.\nProblems: Possibility of embarrassment due to lack of\nexperience in certain positions.\nExperience: Majority of participants admitted to exp erie n ce in most areas, but weren't too happy with changing\npositions, since some required\nmore tactical man oe uv ring than\nothers. Group organiser, Sara,,\ndid suggest that once you've\ndone one you've done them all, but in games of this nature she\nhas been known to get around a bit.\nGame: Sticky situations did\narise, but these were not insurmountable. Moving it from side\nto side appeared to have better\nresults than placing it straight\ndown the middle.\nJo angled one in straight through the legs of a participant,\nwhereas Karen was a bit less\ndaring and centred one perfectly.\nThus the game progressed until\nboth parties retired to the\nshowers.\nRugby\nSeconds\nIC vs Rosslyn Park Vths 36-6\nThe day after Carnival saw IC\nmake a slow and ponderous start\nagainst Roslyn Park 5th s. It took\nforty minutes before the IC players decided that perhaps\nthey didn't get that drunk the\nprevious evening and locomotion\nwas indeed still possible. From then onIC rarely left their opponents half and starved the\nopposition of nearly all possess ion. Strong work from the\nforwards ensured plenty ball for\na good attacking baseline, although at times the handling\nleft something to be desired. A good move in the three-quarter\nline and strong running from\nPhil Clarke gave Roger Flynn a touchdown in the corner for the\nlast try of the game. Tries were\nalso scored by Roger (2), Paul,\nJohn, Charles, Andy, Micky and\nJim to give a final score of 36-6.\nTen Pin Bowling\nIC vs Portsmouth Poly 2-8\nAt long last, there was actually\nsome excitement for the Bowling\nClub last week when the coach\nbroke down and the driver wandered off to a nea by hostelry\nto discuss the state of the world\nwith the landlord. While he was\naway two officers of the law\nturned up and despite Ian Ridgley's efforts to open the\ndoor they managed to get in.\nCaptain Chris Wells smiled nicely and managed to persuade\nthe police not to take us all in as\nlong as Mark Sample agreed to\ndonate a pint of blood to the\nPolice Christmas Ball fund. The\ndriver eventually turned up and\ncarefully avoided breathing in\nthe general direction of the PCs and a replacement coach got us\nhome only n hours late.\nBack to the grind on Sunday\nas the IC team lost to Portsmouth\nPoly but we pushed them much\nharder than usual, our A team in\nparticular managed to tread all\nover the opposition. Megastar of\nthe day was Dave Gee with a series of 616.\nRifle & Pistol\nAnother exciting week down on\nthe range with radically improved\nscores registered by Steve and\nMark, both, hitting hot 99s. Asked to comment on his performance Steve Harrison( Club Captain, contact via q Elec\nEng letter-racks) admitted that a new leg geometry is adding stability to his position. Crisis\nstruck when rock a ff ici on a do Gary Smith discovered that his\nPhil Collins gig coincided with\nthe annual club din-dins. Regrettably Mr Collins was unable to\nagree to a change of date hence\nthe dinner will now be held on\nFriday December 3 (all members\nplease note).\nClub outing to the Army ranges at Bisley takes place on\nSunday. Those attending will\nneed warm costumes, money for\nlunch, rail card, etc. We meet\n9 : 0 0 am under the departure board at Waterloo Station.\nSquash\nl sts2 nds3 rds4 th s vs K CH1 vs St MH2 vs BSO 1\nvs St GH250500514 Page121 I November 19,19821\nLadies vs St GH205 Sorry to say that the Thirds\nand Fourths are slipping behind\nin the points table. The Firsts\nhammered K CH and are undoubtedly one of the most powerful sides out of all the\nLondon colleges. The Seconds\nalso have a walkover (5-0) to\ntheir credit after the rearranged\nmatch against Westfield 1 was\nagain cancelled.\nI hope everyone' shada chance to look at our glorious\nmulti coloured ladder, bought and erected at fabulous expense.\nThankyou ACC Exec!

He retained most of\nhis faculties to the end, in spite of four previous\nrumours of his demise. Since all old newspapers are periodically destroyed in order\nthat the lies conveyed within their pages are\nnot perpetuated, it is not known when these\nrumours were. It is known, however, that the\nPresident was over 50 when the first rumour\nstarted, and that if we say that these rumours\noccurred when the President was A,B,C and\nD years old, where A,B,C, and D are not\nnecessarily all different, then AxB x CxD=47,029,248, and A+ B+C+D is an odd\nnumber. It is of purely academic interest, of\ncourse, but how old was the President when\nthese rumours occurred?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. \u00a35 from\nMend-a Bike for a randomly selected entry.\nLast Week's Solution\nFirst let me scotch a malicious rumour; I neither\nam, nor ever have been, Martin S Taylor, SMart in Taylor, Taylor MartinS, nor any\ncombination of the above.

    "content": "[OPINION I Exposing\nthe Nazi-Zionist\nConnection\n\u2014 A Jewish Viewpoint\nAre the Israelis the new Nazis? This is the clear question behind last\nweek's article 'The Palestinian Holocaust'p Use of the phrases\n'holocaust', 'genocide' and 'concentration camps in the Second World\nWar' combine to create the impression that driven by 'the Zionist aim\nto create an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine' the Israelis are\nmercilessly butchering the Palestinian people.\nMenachem Begin has used the article are trying to imply that\nHolocaust to justify some of his\nactions over the years, much to\nthe horror of those Jews and\nnon-Jews who wish to see the\nmemory of that unimaginable\nperiod preserved as accurately as\npossible, as a warning for future\ngenerations. Right wing revisionist historians, in a far more\nextreme manner, have taken a cavalier attitude to the facts of\nthe Holocaust, maintaining that\nHitler did not know about the\nmurder of the Jews and that in\nany case six million Jews were\nnot really killed. This vile\nnonsense is publicised by the\nNational Front and other similar\ngroups.\nNow, alas, it would appear\nthat the Holocaust is to be\nabused for political purposes yet\nagain, in the way in which last\nweek's article cynically overstates what could have been a perfectly legitimate case.\nThe Israelis are not running a 'concentration camp' in Southern\nLebanon. Even if the Israelis\nwere torturing every Palestinian\nin this camp (and there is not a shred of evidence to support\nsuch a ridiculous claim) it is hard\nto imagine that they are gassing\nPalestinians, turning their bodies\ninto candles or performing atrocious medical experiments\non them, to mention but a few of\nthe more notable crimes committed by the Nazis.\nThe 'genocide at Sabra and\nChetila' was a terrible blot on\nthe record of all involved and an\nappalling human tragedy. But\n'genocide' means the destruction\nof an entire people which it was\nnot. Again the word 'holocaust'\nis totally unreasonable in the\ncontext, vastly overstating in its\nimplications, the actual events in\nLebanon (bad as they were).\nIt seems to the Jewish Society\nthat the use of these emotive\nexpressions and the tone of the\nZionism is Nazism, an intensely\noffensive accusation to Jews,\nand to anybody with an awareness of the past forty years of\nhistory.\nPeace Now\nThe sad part of this article is that\nmuch valid (and much invalid)\ncriticism of Israel has appeared\nrecently in the Western Press\n(and in the Israeli press) and\nthese points alone would be\nquite sufficient to establish that\nthe Palestinians have suffered\nrecently in Lebanon and will\ncontinue to suffer as refugees\nuntil some resolution to the\nconflict in the Middle East is\nfound.\nThe article mentioned with\npraise the Peace Now movement\nin Israel who have (and continue)\nto speak openly for Palestinian\nrights and an eventual solution\nbased on the partition of Israel/Palestine. However, Peace Now are also Zionists and\neven the most moderate Peace\nNow members would find it\nhard to sit down and talk with\nan extremist who claims that\nZionists are no better than\nNazis.\nThe other side of the lack of\nobjectivity of the article was the\nwhitewashing of the PLO' s attitude towards Israel over the\nyears. Under the subtitle ' PLO peacemakers' we were told that\n\"the PLO...has always sought\ntowards finding a peaceful\nsolution to the conflict.\" When\nYasser Arafat spoke to the\nUnited Nations it is true that he\nheld an olive branch in one\nhand. He held a submachine gun\nin the other.\nMore importantly, the covenant of the PLO calls explicitly\nfor the destruction of the State\nof Israel and replacing it by a \"secular, democratic\" Palestine.\nTo achieve this it calls for\n\" armed struggle\" and the\nexpulsion of the Zionist settlers\n(ie Israeli Jews from, presumably,\n1897). This is not a peaceful,\ndiplomatic approach.\nIt would have been argued that\nterrorism has been necessary for\nthe Palestinians to make their\nI, rut\nMUST\ntiers\nTO\nOF\nmi Y. AtJAFflT\nvoice heard; however, last\nweek's article attempts to deny\nany but peaceful actions to the\nPLO, once again indulging in a completely pointless hiding of\nthe truth.\nMutual\nRecognition\nThe official policy of Imperial\nCollege Jewish Society, along\nwith the Union of Jewish Students to which it is affiliated,\nis mutual recognition of Jewish\nand Palestinian rights, and that\nany future settlement should be\non the basis of this fundamentally\nimportant recognition. At the\nformation of the IC Friends of\nPalestine Society the suggestion\nwas made by the Jewish Society\nthat it may be possible to find\ncommon ground based on one\npolicy, towards putting forward\na joint motion on Israel/Palestine\ntheory in the Union (an event\nwhich in a small way would\nmake history!). This was due to\nthe very reasonable speeches\ngiven by some members of the\nPalestine Society\u2014implicitly\nrecognising the right of Israel to\nexist and calling essentially for a Palestinian State on the West\nBank and Gaza (yes, this is also\nPeace Now policy). We chose to\nset aside as atypical a disturbing\nspeech of solidarity by a member\nof the Islamic Society, calling for\nthe Jews to pack up their bags\nand leave Israel \" in peace\",\nbefore they are thrown out\n\"harshly\", by force.\nWe are now publicly repeating\nthis offer to the Friends of\nPalestine Society with that\nwarning that if the extremism so\nblatantly shown in last weeks\narticle is the true mark of the\nsociety any communication will\nhave to cease. Comparison of\nthe Nazi Holocaust to the recent\nevents in Lebanon is just as\noffensive to Jews as the ranting s of the lunatic right wing on the\nsame subject. If there is to be a dialogue between Jews and\nPalestinians (and between Israel\nand the PLO in the long term)\nthis must be on the basis of\nmutual understanding of the\nfeelings of each side. Consequently, it would be very\nwelcome if the leaders of the\nFriends of Palestine Society\nwould be prepared to publicly\ndisassociate themselves from the\ndisgraceful comparisons in their\n(anonymous!) article, and we\nchallenge them to do so.\nD Rickman\npp IC J Soc\nPage61 INovember 19, 19821 I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Council\nCouncil is the main decision-making body of IC Union, second only to the Union General Meeting in its authority.\nIt only meets three or four times\na term and yet last Monday over\nhalf its members failed to show\nup. I was not there either, even\nthough it is part of my job to\nattend. Why this surge of apathy\nby those who are elected representatives of the student body?\nAnswer: only two notes were\nsent out to advise us of the\nmeeting, one by Mary Freeman\nlast July, and one which I received four hours before the\nstart of the meeting.\nSecurity\nMany people are concerned about the amount of theft from\nthe Union Gym and other parts\nof the Union Building, and Christine Teller has written to\nask me to ask you not to leave\nclothing or other valuables EDITORIAL\nunattended.( Why Christine Teller, incidentally? Has she\nforgotten that she isn't Deputy\nPresident any more?) Anything\nsuspicious should be reported to\nthe Union Office or Mr Reeves\nin Security immediately. You should also carry your Union card at all times; while the thefts\ncontinue, Union officers will be\ncarrying out spot checks, and\nanyone without a Unioncard is\nliable to be thrown out of the\nbuilding.\nFELIX Dinner\nThis is on December3, a fortnight today. The cost is \u00a38.50\nfor an n course meal, everyone is\nwelcome and the guest speaker is\nSue Arnold of the Observer.\nNames to the FELIX Office by\nTuesday lunchtime, please. Postdated cheques will be accepted.\nCopy Deadline\nWhen Mary Freeman resigned I produced a one page FELIX in\nthree hours and everyone was\nfull of praise. Each week I produce a sixteen page FELIX in forty-eight hours (three days,\nallowing me eight hours sleep)\nand everyone is incredulous that\nI need so much time. Copy deadline is 1730h Monday, and\nanything received after that time\nmay not go in. I also reserve the\nright to cut letters and small ads\nwhich are excessively silly, long\nor anonymous.\nFELIX Staff\nThanks to all the people who\nresponded to last week's carrot.\nStaff problems are sorting\nthemselves out, although we\ncould still do with more helpers,\nparticularly on Wednesday\nevening.\nImpossible Without\nNick Bedding and Nick Hill for\nreviews, Dave Parry for photo-graph y, Adrian James, John\nVedy, Howard Bell, Viv Draper\nfor news (four of them\u2014a new\nrecord!), Pinocchio and Walk about Look see for their\nrespective columns, Bow-tie for\nRoyf, Roy f for buying us drinks,\nChris Mall a band for sports,\nHugh Southey for What's On,\nCaroline Foers for Clubs and\nSocieties, Petra Barry, Nick\nPyne, Mark Smith, Andy Wood\nand Diane Love for pasting-up,\nall the STOIC hacks who collate,\nMaz, Peter and any errors or\nomissions.\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 ' _ fB HH^^^^^ Ol ^ ^ T\"i iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii i1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111l1 DC LV/ W^_I_I_ M I_I 1 1\n1 1 1 t11t11111 JL 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nJ1I Irl li iiii \u2022 \u2022 Ill l tIll \u2022 l\\%\\ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nll ll ll ll1 ll ll ll lli ill lil lil ll \u2022\nI'M GLAD TO see that J Martin\nTaylor hasn't totally retired from the political scene at IC after his presidential election\ndefeat in March last year. Second and third years will remember that last year IC was\noverrun with Martin Taylors( four, actually) two of whom, to\nthe best of my knowledge, have\nleft, one is FELIX Editor, and\none, J Martin Taylor, is now\ndoing a postgraduate course in Nuclear Fuels where he and his\noffice mates spend much time\nexplaining to visitors that no, this is not the Martin Taylor this\nis someone else. God knows what confusion would have\nreigned if he'd succeeded in his\npresidential campaign.\nDuring his career as a super-hack, Martin acquired a reputation as a maker of long boring\nspeeches and this, together with\nhis commendable determination\nto represent the views of non-hacks, made him many enemies\non Council. This is a great pity,\nas he is a warm and sympathetic\nperson with a generous sense of\nhumour which he frequently turns against himself, his much-mocked northern accent and his\nfrequent social gaffes. His classic\nquote concerned David Owen:\n\" He was even more boring than\nIam!\" It takes a brave man to\nmake a joke like that.\nMore recently, at an outing of\nMartin Taylors, he demonstrated\nhis aptitude for bewildering his\ncompanions when he studied a restaurant menu for a few minutes before asking the FELIX Editor in all seriousness\n\" What is a sausage?\"\nFinally, to dinner with Enoch\nPowell during his visit to College\na few weeks back. Mr Powell\nhad his meal at the Rector's house in the company of Lord Flowers, Stephen Gould er, several other important dignitaries and, as it happened, Martin Taylor. The conversation\nturned to Mr Powell's love of philology, and his ability to\nspeak twelve languages fluently.\nAn impressive pause was broken\nby a distinctive Lancashire tone\nuttering in pl on king voice \"I 've\ngot a nO Level in French,\" which effectively silenced further\nconversation-for the next ten\nminutes.\nTHE DIFFICULTIES of making\nlight conversation with important people are considerable, though. It is said that Lord' Rab' Butler, when Master of Trinity\nCollege, always used to bandage\nup his hand before meeting undergraduates in order to provide an immediate topic of conversation. No such excuse\nwas needed by gangling FELIX Business Manager Peter Rodgers\nwhen faced with Lord Flowers\non a social occasion. He looked\nhis straight in the eye and in his\naggressive Ulster accent snapped\n\" Are you the Rector, then?\"\nLord Flowers, unflappable as\never, remarked blandly \" Iam sometimes\" which must be one\nof the few recorded attempts at\nrector i al humour.\nALL THIS NONSENSE about\nchain letters (which the Editor\nand News Editor have started\ncalling ' ChainMail') reminds me\nof one my father was sent several\nyears ago. After all the usual\nguff about sending copies to four\nfriends, moving names around\nand adding your own name to\nthe foot of the list, it continued\n\" Now bundle up your wife and\nsend her to the address at the top\nof the list; within three weeks\nyou will receive 1,024 women\nfrom all different parts of the\ncountry.\"\nROY FRANCIS\nINTERNATIONAL FEMALE IMPERSONATOR\nSINGER - COMEDIAN - IMPRESSIONIST\nAVAILABLEFOR CABARET, etc.\nFrom the newspaper The Stage.\nFELIX November 19, 1982 PwgeS\n\n"

    "content": "ISPORTI\nFootball\nSeconds\nIC vs UC II 3-2\nSunday evening in the bath\nseems a good time to look back\non a day when IC 2 overcame\nthe auld enemy as well as the\nadministrative cock-ups of their\nown club. A day when, the VIIs\nwent to play at Merton, when\nthey should have been at Harlington, no referees were ar-ranged, the opposition were left\nat the Union as no-one knew\nthey were coming on our coach,\nand Steve Jomo Rimmer proved\nsmall folk can beat defenders in\nthe air but only when the ball's two feet off the ground!\nAfter a hectic start, the IC\ndefence were put under a lot of\npressure and Burns, Bern s, Powell and Tony( last name\nunknown) did well to hold out\nthe IC attack of Coussens, Rigby\nand Rimmer woke up soon after\nand Rimmer it was who made\nthe net bulge for IC's first. H T10.UC could have been finished\noff within two minutes of the\nstart but alas, they regained their\ncomposure and a minor, ahem,\nmistake left Mike Hardy picking\nthe ball out of the net instead of\nfrom between his feet.\nAfter a period of to ing and\nfro ing Dave Hardy, who had\nbeen combing well in midfield\nwith Gaskill and Buckley, just\ndashed off on his own and\nscored, so much for a patient\nbuild-up. UC, however, came\nback again and bucked it up at\n2-2.\nAnd then, with only a few\nminutes remaining, Berns floated the ball back into the box and\nthe Gnome stooped low (why\ndidn't he just kick it) to head\nhome the winner and send BB J into a two minute celebratory\ndance routine, after which, Andy\nthe snooker player turned referee blew for full-time.\nVolleyball\nThis season is beginning to\nresemble a repeat of last year,\nwith I CV BC first team winning\nits first three SEE TECH League\nmatches in straight sets. So far\nWatford, SouthBank and\nMiddlesex Polys have fallen\nvictim to Pete Walker's spikes,\nChristo's sneaky short balls, and\nMans generally dirty tricks.\nWith Hairy Christo d poul ou setting the cultural tone of the\nteam, newcomers like Mike James must be wondering whether the IC prospectus told\nthe whole truth. Only the\ncaptain (author of this fiction),\nin his dashing cherry pickers and\nmoustache, shows modest pro-mise, though well disguised,\nbeneath mumbled obscenities.\nOf 'Falling Francois' Grey the\nless said the better.\nOn to the second team then.\nAs yet un blooded, led by the\nabove mentioned Francois, they\nwill shortly be playing the\nGerman School, the French Lycee, and possibly the Wimbledon YMCA. Plenty of promise\namongst the newcomers, with a bit of luck and some coordination they should do well.\nMustn't forget to mention the\nladies, either, who will soon be\nplaying various friendly matches\nfor the experience. Anybody interested (preferably female)\nplease contact Nada el-Yassir\nLS2, or just come around to a ladies training evening (Tues-days 1730-1900h at the Volleyball Court, behind Biochemistry).\nWe also train Wednesday and\nSaturday afternoons (1330 till\nabout 1700h). Team: P Dias-Lalcaca (capt),\nP Walker, N El-Yassir, A Green,\nF Grey, A Knap, C Christou, M Lam, H Christodoulou, M James,\nS Lauria (baggage attendant!).\n|0I Sailing\nScore (Liverpool Street 7:00am): IC vs C&G Carnival 4-2\nPeter, obviously being too hung\nover, didn't even master the BR\nt annoy at Ipswich\u2014perhaps\nNova could give him some\nlessons.\nDespite cry s of 'Water', 'Mast\nabeam', and 'I 've got to get my\nleg over' from the UEA ladies,\nwe scored a win against them.\nTheir mens team, however,\nwould not s uc combe to our\ncharms (where was Peter?) and\nwe were convincingly defeated in\nboth races against them in spite\nof the supreme efforts of Dawdler\nDalton and Back-of-the-Fleet\nBennett, the latter being unable\nto resist his annual dip in Oulton\nBroads.\nThe second round was arranged at the When yIn n, followed by a lightening drive\nback to Norwich to catch the last\ntrain.\nThis posed two questions: why\ndo UEA have mattresses in the\nback of their vans? And where\nwas Peter when we needed him\nmost?\nTeam: Julian Bennett, Graham\nDalton, Graham Kennedy, Nora\nMyers, JameS Redman, Richard\nTostevin, Peter Howarth (a polo gies).\nAt the Harp: Sailing continues\nthroughout the winter every\nWednesday afternoon with food\nand cheap beer in the evenings.\nPeter will be there.\nJudo\nWell here it is, what you've all\nbeen waiting for, the first judo\narticle of the academic year. OK, so I exaggerate, but here's the\nimportant bit.\nGradings: Congratulations to\nKeith and Terry who both\npicked up points at their first\nDan grading s. Keith got 10 and\nTerry 17.\nAlso congratulations to me\nand Andy P.I graded to 6th Kyu\nand Andy to 8th. Forthcoming events: IC have\nin their possession a nice shiny\ntrophy, which unfortunately\nLondon Medical College want.\nSo to be fair we have to fight\nthem for it. This will take place\non November 30 at IC.\nOur team consists of Martin,\nTerry, Tim, Keith and Mark.\nBye for now.\nFencing\nOur second match of the season\nagainst UCL and it could scarcely have been more different\nfrom the first. In fact, it was so\nvery different that it was almost\na mirror image, with instead of\nthe ladies and novices teams\nwinning, only the ladies team\nlost (the novices did not fence).\nIndeed, this match saw an\naltogether changed outlook\nfrom the male teams. The sabre urs won 8-1, the foil teams\nA and B won 5-4 each, and the\ne pee( the greatest change of all,\nfrom losing 1-8) won 6-3.\nThus, it was an altogether\nmore pleasing match (bar the\nladies, poor dears), one which\nleaves us looking forward to the\nnext.\nBasketball\nIC vs Ealing College 75-106\nFor the opening match of the\nseason the court was packed by a capacity crowd. Both of them\nwere visibly excited by the\ni prospect of this match between\ntwo giants of the London Colleges Basketball League.\nThe match tipped off at 7:30\nand by 7:37 IC's fate was sealed\nas Ealing amassed an early 20\npoint lead. (Mainly as the IC\nteam was having forty winks\nrecovering from a two hour\nwarm-up!).\nWhen awake the team fought\nlike tigers, matching Ealing basket for basket, losing teeth in\nthe process (Tamman was the\nunfortunate victim).\nGenerally a mediocre team\nperformance and George's contribution of a mere thirty\npoints did little to help our\nsituation!\nTeam: Brian, Nick, George,\nAlan, Tamman, Andy, Ian, Ken,\nJohn and Tim.\nBoat\nLast Saturday three fours from\nImperial College took part in the.\nHead of the River Fours Race.\nAlthough starting in the new\nentries at the back of the field all\ncrews rowed exceptionally well\nto finish well up in the order.\nThe two cox less fours (IC I and\nII) were within four seconds of\neach other finishing 28th and\n24th respectively out of about\n330 crews. In doing this they\nbeat two crews from UL and\ncame within five seconds of the\nfastest National Lightweight\nfour. The cox ed four IC3 finished45 th, only fifteen\nseconds behind our cox less boats, and beating equivalent\ncollege opposition convincingly.\nThe crews were: T Anderson,\nP Allen, P McConnell, B Downing (IC I);J Thorp, W Bradbury,\nJO 'Brien, P Edwards (IC II); J Griffiths, G Harding, E Mendez,\nM Greaves (IC III).\nFELIX\u00a3 I November 19, 19821\nMixed\nIC vs UC18 The mixed First team rumbled\ninto action last Wednesday. The\nclub captain decided it was time\nto make a guest appearance. In\nretrospect this turned out to be\nnot such a good idea!\nIan and Jo played as well as\ncan be expected without Jaffa\ncakes. Dominic and Jane played\nvery well but to no avail. Dominic seemed to be arguing\nwith himself for a lot of the time.\nThe club captain wishes he\nhadn't played!\nIPage13\n\n"

This means that my grandmother dies 1,000 times\neach day! If I were to try to\navoid the cracks, this would mean walking like a1920s film,\nor leaping around as if practising\nfor the Olympic triple jump record. In all honesty, could\nsomething not be done, like chopping me off at the knees\n(preferably the top half!).\nYours\nRoom114 Diwali\nCelebrations\nDear Sir\nLast Saturday (Nov 13) was\nthe day of the annual Diwali Celebrations held by the India\nSociety in the J CR. This is by far\nthe biggest single function held\nby the society each year and\nattracts large contingents of Indian/ Asian students of varied\nbackgrounds from all over London. Such a crowd of diverse\nethnic origins would I presume\ndictate a function to be varied to\nsuit most people if not all.\nAlas the function was nothing\nof the kind. The main part consisted of' Punjabi' songs\npunctuated by a few ' Hindi' songs. This session lasted for at\nleast an hour and a half. Having being throughly bored by now\nwe were subjected to yet another\npiece of Punjabi culture: Bhangra\ndancing. Then followed the\nPage 4\nDisco and would you believe it,\nyes, Punjabi songs had almost\nhalf the share. As a non-Punjabi\nmyself and I am sure speaking\nfor hundreds more, I was thoroughly bored and frustrated\nand felt out of place at this\nfunction.\nI would like to ask the President why was such a Punjabi-biased show allowed to\ncarry on when he himself assured us that \" Punjabi biased\nfunctions would not take place if\nhe were elected, as has happened\nin the past,\" at his election speech! India Society is a society\nto cater for the needs of all its\nmembers, who I assure you are\nnot all Punjabis. I cannot see the\npoint of paying \u00a31.50 for the\nenjoyment of one section of the\ncrowd when half of them were\nbored sick and wondering why\nwere they here! Diwali is\ncelebrated all over India, not\nonly in the Punjab. The President requires a lesson in geography as it seems he cannot see\nfurther than the Punjab! I feel he\nhas a lot of explaining to do to\nhis fellow members.\nYours faithfully\nA Chakravarty\nME PG Civ Eng\nDear FELIX\nWhen I applied to IC to study\ncivil engineering, I did so on the\nunderstanding that the facilities\nfor this course were some of the\nfinest in the country. However,\nthe department cannot claim to\npro v die for all the needs of its\nstudents where it does not install\na coffee-machine, the lack of\nwhich causes great hardship, stress and exercise to over worked civil engineers as we\nrush to the J CR and back.\nWhy is it that inferior disciplines, such as Me chEng and\nPhysics, should have their own\ncoffee-machines? More to the\npoint, is it fair that we pay 16p for coffee in the buttery, whilst\nphysicists pay a mere 9p?I tend\nto the conclusion that someone\nhas a protection racket on here; I mean, who would pay good money for a cup of bitumen from\nMr Mooney when he could enjoy\na decent drink at a fairer price?\nApart from the prestige gained by the department, students would feel far more\ninclined to attend lectures on\ntime. It would also encourage\ncontact between the years.\nYours\nMAGnus Ci vEng1 Courtesy in\nFELIX\nDear Martin\nUpon gaily tripping Into the\nFELIX Office oi ;\nyI was\nconfronted by the v vo e ful( alas\nand a lack) sight of an unfolded\nFELIX. Whilst gathering together the assorted sheets and\nfolding them in the wrong order.\nI attempted a little trivial light\nconversation with a rather un savoury gentleman with a beard, sitting on one of your\ntables drinking coffee.\nI opened with an innocent\nsnippet about the state of FELIX, thrown casually to the\nwind, and he replied with the\nsubtle charm and eloquent repartee of a Liverpool docker\nwith a crowbar through his head.\nSomewhat taken aback, and\nfearing he might' do something\nhasty like tear me limb from\nlimb and feed me to the folding\nmachine, I wished him good-day\nand sallied hence to my place of\nresidence.\nIt is now my painful duty to\nexact satisfaction for this affront, for which I demand either that you nail the offending\ngentleman's naughty bits to the\nrafters, or that you print this\nletter and give me a free cup of\nFELIX coffee, whichever costs\nyou less time, money or step\nladders.\nYours pompously\nAndy Robinson\nDo Cl PS: I always thought they were\ncalled evangelists, not Catholics.\nDear Martin\nI was sitting in the FELIX Office last week drinking tea\nwhen some obnoxious weed poked his head through the door\ndemanding a FELIX. As the\nfolding machine had recently\ndied, said publication was unfolded which seemed to\naggrieve said party greatly. When I informed the gentleman of his democratic right to\nask the Editor to resign if he felt\nhe could do the job better he\nflew into a frenzy, holding forth\nwith all the force of a wood elf.\nReally Martin,I must question\nyour policy of letting plebs past\nthe hallowed portals of the\nFELIX Office if this is all they're\ngoing to do.\nYours\nThe hairy fat slob\nBodies\nDear Sir or Madam\nIam writing in thorough disgust after my recent perusal\nof Jon Barnett's little white book\nin which I was shocked to find\nno warning to unsuspecting fresher s of the certain activities\nof particular bodies that exhibit\na certain duality and hence can\nbe found interfering with themselves in specific laboratories in\nthe infamous den of iniquity, the\nBlackett Laboratory. Being a second year physicist I was not\noverly shocked but* the thought\nof the aforementioned particular\nbodies exhibiting this behaviour\nin places open to unsuspecting\nand innocent first year students\nbrings me to ask for the expulsion from the College of all\nbodies using their wave-particle\nproperties in such an unseemly\nmanner.\nD Ganger\nPhysics 2\nPaul Griffin\nNews (again)\nDear Martin\nIn reply (if one is needed!) to\nGlyn Garside's accusations of\nanti-socialist reporting in last\nweek's news: the reason for his\nattack seems to be that I do not\nbias the news towards his way of\nthinking.* Iam therefore a Reactionary Capitalist, and because I do not go in for the\nego-trip of plastering my name\nunder every news item that I write (eight last week) Iam cowering behind the agony mit y of the Fascist Press!\nFor a member of the Debating\nSociety, Mr Garside is remarkably unfamiliar with the English\nlanguage.

In point of fact I agreed with much of Sir Ashley's speech; presumably if I had let\nmy opinions show through the\nnews article Mr Garside would\nnot have complained.\nI would point out that while\nwe did edit our his numerous\nspelling and grammatical errors,\nMr Gar side might remember that it is better to keep silent and\nto be thought stupid, than to\nwrite illiterate letters to FELIX and remove all doubt.\nYours arrogantly\nAdrian James\n\u2022 For want of a better word\n\u2022 HH HH H FELIX\nNovember 19, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nCHELSEA TO BE\nPENSIONED OFF?\nProfessor Randolph Quirk, Vice-Chancellor of the University of London\nhas been attending a series of meetings at Chelsea this week with the\naim of writing a draft proposal of intent to merge the college in\naccordance with the SARC Report. This is a plan to concentrate the\nscience departments of the University on five sites: Imperial, University\nCollege, Kings/QEC, Queen Mary College and the recently merged\nBedford/Royal Holloway College.\nIn a Union General Meeting\nyesterday, Chelsea students\nvoted unanimously to oppose all\nmergers and cuts, but they have\nbeen told that if they do not\nmerge, their grant allocation\nfrom the University of London\nwill be cut further still. Already,\nthey have been forced to close\ntheir two non-scientific departments (Humanities and Social\nStudies) and they have been\ninstructed to cut academic staff\nby a third before next year.\nThe proposed merger follows\nonly months after Kings and\nQE C merged\u2014this time last\nyear, moves were afoot to join\nQE C with Imperial\u2014and is the\nthird such scheme since the\nS ARC reports. Chelsea is in\nmuch the same position as\nBedford College, which had to\nclose its internationally recognised classics department and\nform a split-site college with\nRoyal Holloway thirty miles\naway in Egham.\nChelsea Students Union representatives have said that\neven if they are forced to merge,\nthey will refuse to operate a split site system like that\noperating at QE C, where students travel from Notting Hill to\nthe Strand four times per week\nby bus. Although they have been\nassured that academic standards\nwill not fall, they are skeptical as\ntheir staff/student ratio is being\ncut.\nFollowing Wednesday's demonstration in the Kings Road in\nsupport of the NUS grants\ncampaign, during which a road\nwas blocked, Chelsea Union\nExecutive is confident that it has\nenough activists to make their\nopposition heard.\nChain\nLetters\nHit IC\nAn outbreak of chain letters is\nsweeping through Imperial\nCollege. As many as five hundred\nstudents are believed to have\ntaken part; some claim to have\nmade up to \u00a31,000 but most may\nexpect to lose out on the deal.\nThe letters, which are believed\nto have originated in Dorset and\ncome into the College through\nthe Geology Department, promise a return of up to \u00a3164,000\nfor a short-term loan of \u00a340 and\noperate within a system known\nas the 'Gold Circle'. The procedure is as follows: you buy a list of twelve names from a friend for \u00a320. You then (in the\npresence of your trusted friend)\npost \u00a320 to the person whose\nname and address is at the top of\nthe list, and copy the list out\ntwice, moving each name up one\nplace on the 'ladder'; removing\nthe name at the top and putting\nyour name at number twelve,\nyou then sell your lists to two\npeople for \u00a320 each, recovering\nthe money that you have spent.\nThe theory is that after a further twelve stages of the\noperation, there will be 21 2\nlists\nwith your name at the top, and\nfrom each of these you will\nreceive \u00a320\u2014a total of \u00a380,780.\nThe system breaks down\nbecause the money has to come\nfrom somewhere. After twenty\nsteps, about a million people\nhave lists, and have to sell them\non what is now a saturated\nmarket. A further step merely\ndoubles the number of people\ntrying to sell the lists. The 'Gold\nCircle' system has certainly been\nthrough that many steps already,\nand a letter has been received\nfrom the University of London\nUnion advising people not to\nbuy the letters.\nThe covering letter provided\nwith the chain letter is remarkably insidious, in that it enc our continued on back page\nA Load\nOf Bull\nAt last Thursday'sU GM the\nRCS were proudly able to\npresent 'Velish', the fearsome\nhead of an Aberdeen Angus bull.\nThis fine specimen was, as\nreported last week, the mascot\nremoved from the School of\nSlavonic and East European\nStudies (SSEES) with no greater\nopposition than the cries of a marauding tea lady.\nIn return for the return of\ntheir mascot, the SSEES have\nagreed to provide sufficient\nenthusiastic volunteers to be\nable to raise a minimum of \u00a350\nfor the RCS Rag collection on\nSaturday.\nTwo RCSU Officials with the stuffed bull's head.

This year, however, they\nhad to have a float with the\nOperation Drake Fellowship\nbecause of' dying student\nparticipation'. In fact Guilds\nwere the only student float left in\nthe show, since Barts and City\nwere cast out completely, which\npeeved two City students who\nappeared at the start.\nThe spirit of the occasion was\nconsistently high, with Boomalakas for the Lord Mayor, the\ncameras, the little girl on her\ndaddy's shoulders who wasn't smiling\nCentipede\nAssalted\nSocial activities in Selkirk Hall\nwill suffer as a consequence of\nvandalism carried out in the\nearly hours of Saturday morning.\nA large quantity of salt was\npoured into the Centipede video\ngame and one of the telephones,\nand costs of repair have been\nconsiderable. The profit sharing\nscheme which Selkirk has with\nthe owners of the games machines enables social events to be\nsub sidi sed. The cost of repairs\nhas had to come from Selkirk's share of the profit and Warden\nHenry Hutchinson has pointed\nout that the entire Hall will be\nhit by the action of a few\nirresponsible people.\nWhere Were\nThey?\nOnly two of the College's twelve\ndepartmental representatives\nturned up to Monday's Council\nmeeting, which was declared\nin quo rate from the start. This\nwill probably assist the move to\nremove Dep Reps from Council.\nOf the Council's forty-odd\nmembers, less than half turned\nup, and John Passmore objected\nto the meeting being opened\nwithout a quorum\u2014much to the ,\nanno ny ance of those who had\nturned up in the hope of getting\nthrough a great deal of Union\nbusiness. The meeting was\nadjourned, and Council Chairman Nick Pyne has sent out\nmemos informing councillors of\nfm xi miM mm km mk mm The car they did it in\nVive Le Beaujolais!\nDriving a Rover 2300S loaned by\nBL three members of the City &\nGuilds College Motor Club raced\nacross France to a very creditable\ntwelfth place overall on the\nBeaujoiais Rally earlier this week.\nThe Beaujolais Rally which\ncelebrates the release of the\nBeaujolais Nouveau wine is\nprimarily a distance event where\nthe car covering the shortest\nmileage between a vineyard in\nVillefranche (near Lyons) and\nBrighton wins. However, an\nimportant condition is that all\ncompetitors must catch the\n8:00am ferry from Boulogne to\nDover or be excluded. This means that an average of at least\n45mph must be maintained.\nThe crew, Chris Millard, John\nVedy and Martin Kift, set off\nalong with 124 other competitors\nfrom the vineyard on Sunday\ncomplete with ten cases of\nBeaujolais Nouveau. Because\nthey knew that their route would\nentail driving down slower\ntwisty country lanes as they\nskirted Paris, a high speed stint\nup the A6 autoroute to Ausceme\nwas essential. Unfortunately this\nwas nearly thwarted by dense\ntraffic on the autoroute and time\nwas wasted queueing at tollgates\nhowever as they steamed further\nnorth the road cleared and a steady ll O mph was maintained\nto the fuel stop at Sens.\nAfter refuelling and a change\nof driver and navigator the\nRover continued to make good\ntime partially due to a total\ndisregard of French road traffic\nlaws and eventually easily made\nthe ferry, beating all the Porches\nand Ferraris.\nThe British stint was supposed\nto be fairly leisurely, but delays\nat customs put the schedule back\nand again a high speed sprint\nwas necessary\u2014the car arriving\nat the finish with only two\nminutes to spare.\nThe crew, who hope to raise\nmoney for the mentally handicapped by selling the wine\nbrought back, also came second\nin the charity class.\npolicy that Council members\nwho miss two successive meetings without sending apologies\nare deemed to have resigned.\nThe meeting has been rearranged for next Monday.\nTelephones\nExchanged\nMany telephone calls on the\ncollege switchboard were cut off\nyesterday afternoon. This is\nbecause Kensington exchange is\npreparing to transfer to a new\ncomputer system next Thursday,\nand the problems are likely to\ncontinue until then.\nAsbestos Tiles\nASTM S Union members have\nrefused to work in part of the\nMines Building in the belief that\ndamaged asbestos tiles may\nconstitute a health risk.\nThe suspended ceiling-tiles in\nsome rooms of the Geology\ndepartment have suffered from\nleaking water-pipes, and some\nare now ef flores c ing( that is,\nshedding asbestos dust). Non academic staff have become\nincreasingly concerned, and after a television documentary\non asbestos-related diseases in\nindustry, their Union withdrew\ntheir services from the affected\nareas. They stressed that this was\nnot a strike and that they would\ncontinue to work in other parts\nof the building. Their action will\nhave its greatest effect on industrial research work, which\nis a major source of revenue to\nthe College.\nProfessor Knil l, Head of\nDepartment and Dean of the\nRoyal School of Mines, told\nFELIX that there is no question\nof a dispute between the department and the ASTM S; on the\ncontrary, the department is\ndoing everything in its power to\nresolve the matter. The Estates\nDepartment, he said, has taken a most responsible attitude to the\naffair, and that expenditure has\nbeen authorised for the work to\nbe carried out.\nDoctor Hargreaves, the College Safety Director, said that\nindependent surveys have been\ncarried out and levels of asbestos\ndust in the air were found to be\nwell below the permitted level.\nThe Mines Building was erected\nwell before the restrictions on\nthe use of asbestos were implemented in 1969, but there is no\nquestion of danger from undamaged tiles, and many tiles\nwith a similar appearance have\nno asbestos content at all.\nSunday Times attacks Tebbit\nHugo Young, the political editor\nof the Sunday Times, attacked\nthe Conservative Party for being\nable to consider Norman Tebbit\nas a potential leader.\n\u2022\nTalking to West London Catholic Students at More House on Sunday, Mr Young\nsaid that only five years ago Mr Tebbit would not have been\ntaken seriously, yet he was the\nstar of this year's party confer-en ce. He described Mr Tebbit as\nan unpleasantly ra sci st and anti-union politician who expresses\nviews which the rank and file of\nhis party has held shamefaced ly for many years. But now that\nBritish politics is tending towards extremes, he claimed\nthat the Conservative Party had\ndiscarded all social conscience.\nI November 19, 19821 IPage3\n\n"

    "content": "Heaven 0\nArmaments 1\nMajor Barbara by Bernard Shaw.\nDirected by Peter Gill. The Cottesloe,\nNational Theatre.\nMajor Barbara is one of three plays by\nwhich Shaw converted the theatre into a forum of ideas and debate, where audiences\ncame to be provoked and to be forced to\nthink. The theme in the play is poverty, and\nwhat could or should be done about it. The\nargument is fought between Undershaft, the\nworld's greatest armaments manufacturer\n(played by Brewster Mason), and his daughter\nBarbara, a major in the Salvation Army (played\nby Penelope Wilton). The play was written in\n1905, at a time when Britain was at the summit\nof her Imperial power and was the world's second biggest armaments exporter, and also,\nat a time when it was claimed that one person\nin ten 'lived below the standard of the London\ncab-horse'. Major Barbara appears today to\nhave lost none of its relevance. A frighteningly\nlarge proportion of Britain's population lives on\nor below the officially designated poverty line,\nand this at a time when the Government is\nspending more on defence than any other\ncountry in Europe, and is still selling upwards\nof \u00a3700m worth of armaments a year in\nsecrecy to various governments throughout\nthe world.\nThe play holds interest at the very outset.\nShaw was a vociferous atheist, and an equally\nvociferous socialist. Would he come down on\nthe side of the Salvation Army and the\nKingdom of Heaven, or on the side of the seller\nof arms (called The Prince of Darkness by his\nfamily)?\nUndershaft wins, but not easily and not\nclearly. The argument is conducted as the\nUndershaft family is led around the factory,\nand Shaw argues equally eloquently and\ncleverly for each side. Undershaft claims that\npoverty is a crime, and the high wages and\norganised welfare arrangements with which he\nsaves his workers from the degradation of\npoverty contrast favourably with his\ndaughter's modest charitable rations to the\ndown-and-outs in the Salvation Army's hostel.\nBut Undershaft's philosophy extends further.\nHe firmly upholds the armour er's faith: 'to give\narms to all men who offer an honest price for\nthem, without respect of persons or\nprinciples'. He abhors politicians and others\nwho classify, label and even condemn large\nsections of the world's populace. Who has a right to pass judgements of this kind, and on\nwhat basis?\nThe argument, as may be expected, covers\na great many other issues. However, the usual\nShavian silliness pervades the play like a lingering farmyard smell: the rapacious lady of\nthe family, played by Sian Phillips, is a Lady\nBritomart; the great Undershaft enterprise\nmust always be inherited by a foundling;\nBarbara' s sweetheart (played by Nicholas Jones) who takes on the enterprise at the end\nof the play, is a Professor of Greek; and the\nembarrassing member of the family, Charles\nLomax (played by mark Tandy), wallows in\ninsouciant verbal laziness and exclaims \" Oh, I say!\" all the time. All very silly.\nThis is a good production of Major Barbara,\nbut I fear the pace is rather fast towards the\nend and it becomes a job to keep up. The play\nis certainly much better than Jonathan Lyon's recent production of Shaw's Arms and the\nMan at the Lyric Theatre, and The Dark Lady\nof the Sonnets and The Admirable Bashville at\nthe Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park last\nsummer. The NT production is recommended\nfor lovers of Shaw and anyone who likes a good argument.\nNick Bedding\nWorth Missing\nA Meal For?\nDiary of a Hunger Strike by Peter Sheridan, directed by Pam Brighton, Hull\nTruck Theatre Company at the Round\nHouse.\nAs the title suggests this play examines the\ncomplicated issues of the recent H Block\nhunger strike. The production was not too\nbiased towards the IRA cause (though some\nwould say it was biased merely because the\nsubject was presented at all). The approach\nwas that of a diary, with both warder and\ninmate expressing their emotions and opinions. The arguments from both sides of\nthe Northern Ireland dispute were offered, so\nwhilst there was nothing new in them, at least\nit provided an education for the apparently all-American audience which surrounded me.\nThe most important point which appeared in\nthe play was the lack of interest in N Ireland\nshown by the British. This was shown by the\nnaivety of the Tory peer played by James Wy n( which reflected that of the newly-elected Mrs\nWALKABOUTlOOKStt\nby Mobile Optics Inc.\nThatcher, who thought she could solve the\nproblems of the Province in a few months).\nSecondly, the protestant prison warder( Christopher Whitehouse) who recognised\nthat the British consider Ulstermen to be Irish\nwhilst Irishmen regard them as 'Brits'. Finally,\nthis British lack of interest is illustrated by the\nreplacement warder (Alan Buckingham) who\nis English right down to the London accent and\ntalks only of Spurs Football Club while the rest\nof the prison is experiencing the tension of the\nimminent death of a hunger striker.\nThe moral of this review is 'don't sweep\nNorthern Ireland under your carpet'. Get over\nto the Round House before December 4.\nI Nick Hill\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSeBSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSaBSi\nChristmas is coming, the goose is getting fat,\nKindly put a penny in the old man's hat;\nIf you haven'ta penny, a ha'penny will do,\nIf you haven't got a ha'penny then got bless\nyou.\nEchoing the spirit of tr ad anon above, though not the scansion, Walkabout took me\nalong Brompton Road towards Knightsbridge:\nChristmas is coming, chestnuts are being\nroasted on the pavement, the windows at\nHarrods are full of be-ribbon ed, be-bauble d Christmas trees and the facade is festively\noutlined by a seemingly-endless string of light\nbulbs. Before you get thoroughly bored with\nthe concept of Christmas 1982, and before\nyour grant runs out completely, visit Harrods\nand enjoy the ultimate commercial Xmas.\nIn 1849 Henry Charles Har rod,a tea\nmerchant, took over a small grocery shop in\nMiddle Queen's Building (now Brompton Road): he had a turnover of \u00a320 a week and\nemployed two assistants. Following the Great\nExhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park, Knightsbridge\ngrew from an area infamous for its highway\nrobberies, to a fashionable district. Harrod's business prospered, expanded, and has never\nlooked back.\nThe first escalator in a London store was\ninstalled in Harrods, in 1898. In July 1981, a new bank of escalators was opened on the\nwest side of the store. They are faced in\nRoman travertine marble and incorporate a waterfall from the first to the ground floor!\nCurrently, work is in progress on the\nescalators on the cast side: you can ride up on\ncopper-coloured tradition, and down on silver-grey modernity.\nCarvings from Arctic Canada\nThe ' Art Reflections' gallery, next to the\nGeorgian Restaurant on the fourth floor, offers\na short ex cusio n into the visual arts. The\ngallery contains a small and changing exhibition of Limited Edition re product in s and\nob jets d 'art, and also a collection of original\nEskimo (Inuit) sculpture.\nThe Eskimo carvers work mostly in\nsoapstone, which comes in softly-mottled\nshades of green and grey. The little i figures \u2014 hunters, birds and beasts \u2014 are smoothly polished, and their clear, streamlined\nshapes have a class simplicity and beauty. The\nsculptor's aim is to release the spirit contained\nin each piece of stone; and between them,\nsculptor and spirit produce the likeness of a seal, bear, or whatever. The beauty of the\npiece appears to be incidental, as there is no\nword 'beautiful' in the Inuit language.\nHarrods Limited\n\"Harrods must be a showpiece which attracts\nvisitors from both home and overseas, not\nonly as a trading store, but as a supremely\ndifferent place of interest...(the) wide range of\nhigh quality merchandise must always be seen\nto be good value for money, taking into\naccount the atmosphere and style of Harrods*\nMr Mooney eat your heart out!\niS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS SSS fg i \u00a9\nstatement of policy, which explains the store's objectives and its raison d'e tre.

Darth Vader will make a personal appearance in the Toy Fair, on the\nthird floor, on November20, and Father Christmas will arrive there on November 27\nand stay till Christmas Eve.\nIn the Food Halls, on the ground floor,\nHarrods are presenting a range of Christmas\ngift boxes, brimming with fine food and wine.\nThe 'Supreme' (the hamper of a lift e time, \u00a31,000!) is stuffed with every conceivable\nChristmas goody, from a gallon of Glenfiddich\nwhisky, through multi coloured So bran ie cocktail cigarettes, to a storage jar of Harrods\nBrandy Butter.

    "content": "To NUS or not to NUS is a perennial question\nin many students' unions, and ICU is no\nexception. Five years ago we voted to stay out;\nnow, in view of the NUS grants campaign,\nmany students feel that it may be time to\nreconsider the decision. PHIL NATHAN puts\nthe case for re affiliation NUS: The Case\nFor Reaffiliation\nFive years ago, Imperial College students decided in a campus-wide\nreferendum to withdraw from the National Union of Students (NUS)\nThe decision was made on a margin of about fifty votes out of 1,500\nvotes cast. Many people still believe that the students' union should still\nbe in the NUS, and at the next Union General Meeting on December 7,\na motion will be heard, calling for the referendum required for\nre affiliation. Why should you vote for a referendum, and then,\nultimately for re-affiliation? How can NUS help us?\n(1) Representation to\nGovernment\nThe main work of the NUS is in\nthe annual grant claims made to\ngovernment. Last year the grants\ncampaign brought in for university students a4% grant increase.\nIn other words, it netted on\nbehalf of Imperial students more\nthan \u00a3200,000. The Department\nof Education and Science recognises only one representative student body, the NUS, and this is the organisation the\nDES consults when it is considering any aspect of student\nwelfare, be it housing, prescription charges or parental grant\ncontributions. NUS is the\norganisation that Members of\nParliament consult before\nmaking up their minds on many\ndifferent things that effect our\nlives. It is the strength of NUS with its 1.2m members which\ngives us a4% grant increase; no\nin div diu al students union could\nmanage this on its own. 1.2m student voters united in a grants'\nclaim form an extremely powerful lobbying body. The NUS negotiates for our grants, we\nshould join and support it.\nThe NUS has fought effectively\nagainst the introduction of\nstudent loans and has been the\nmajor force in opposing them\nfor many years; it has managed\nto organise surveys in other\nparts of the world where the\nloans system does operate and\nhas gone back to government\nwith concrete evidence that\nshows loans have a higher rate of\ndefault, cause an expensive\nsystem of administration, and\nPhil Nathan\nprevent poorer students from\nentering further education. Only\na national body like NUS can do\nthings like this. In opposing\nstudent loans, it has been worth\nits weight in gold. The recent\ndefeat of the new, government\nproposed crippling grant regulations, was due largely to the\nskilful lobbying and representation of the student case, to'\nmembers of parliament, carried\nout by NUS. The amount of\nmisery and financial strain that\nthe NUS has saved us in helping\nto defeat these government plans\nis not possible to measure but in\nfinancial terms it must be far\ngreater than the 9% of our\nstudent grant required for\naffiliation.\n(2) Services to Students\nThe student rail card came about\nafter NUS negotiations with\nBritish Rail and over the years\nthis has saved individual students\npounds and pounds. The International Student Identification\nCard( ISIC), giving discount\ntravel for all over Europe and\nfurther, along with many other\nadvantages, was brought about\nthrough the work of the NUS. Those of us who insure with\nEndsleigh, are involved with a company that was set up by\nNUS. It supplies cheaper insurance and better insurance schemes, designed specifically\nfor students.\nThere are many, many other\nways in which the NUS helps\nstudents, the national discount\nscheme, legal protection, welfare\nservices, national competitions,\na national student newspaper\nand much more.\n(3) Helping Our Students Union\nDo you think our student union\nworks effectively and efficiently?\nIn the past year more than 2,000\nunion officers have attended\nNUS training courses. The NUS development and training department has recently devised a special accounting system for\nstudent unions which is now\nused in more than 350 unions. In\naddition sabbatical regional\nofficers are on hand to give\nadvice and assistance in negotiations with College (refectory\nboycotts!!) and local author i ties, to all the unions affiliated to\nNUS. They are also equipped to\ngive expert help and advice on\nthe financial control, administration and development of\nstudent unions.\nThe evidence for supporting\nNUS and joining it is over-w hel ming; yet what were the\nreasons put forward for d is affiliation five years ago.\nA. It was said that NUS was\nineffectual and badly organised.\nHow do those in favour of NUS membership counter this? The\nanswer is quite simple and can\nbe provided by three MPs:\n\"NUS is highly professional\nand argues the case of students\nextremely well. \" - Sir William van Straubenzee, Tory MP and\nformer Junior Education Minister.\n\"NUS is one of the country's most effective educational pressure groups.\" - Shirley Williams,\nSDP Leader, Former Secretary\nof State for Education.\n\"The work of NUS is essential\nin campaigns against education\ncuts.\" \u2014 Neil Kinnock, Labour\nShadow Education Minister.\nNUS is not perfect, but it is\norganised well and though it\nmay be difficult for some to\naccept, NUS is a well co ordinated and effective student\norganisation.\nB. Lefties: this is no kind of\nreason for anything; however it\nwas said that the organisation\nwas dominated by 'trots' and\n'com mies'. All NUS Executive\nmembers are democratically elected at NUS conference\u2014they\nhave included Socialist, Conservative, Communist, Liberal and Labour students. The dominant grouping for the last five\nyears was the 'left alliance', a coalition including Liberal and\nLabour students, but now the\nLabour Students hold sway. Of course political colour makes\nlittle difference since elected\nmembers are all committed to\nstudent welfare and that's what\ncounts. Few would argue that\ntheir efforts have not been of\ngreat benefit to students.\nC. Finance: The most foolish\nand short-sighted reason \u2014\n'Look, we can save 9% of our\nstudent grant,' it was said, 'the\nmoney is just being wasted'; but\nNUS repays over and over again\nthe affiliation money in grant\nclaims, welfare services, discount\nschemes, etc. Because NUS is\nnot seen to hand a lump sum\nof money back to the Union\nwhich pays the affiliation fee,\n'blind' people said it was a waste\nof money.\nD. Undemocratic: Five years\nago it was the case that not all\ndelegates to the national conference were democratically elected. At the last conference a motion calling for all delegates\nto be elected in cross-campus\nballots was passed by the\nrequired two-thirds majority,\nand when it is passed again at\nthe coming conference, all delegates will be democratically\nelected.\nAt the present moment in time\nImperial College students live\noff the backs of other students in\nthis country; gaining many\nadvantages of NUS without\ncontributing anything and having no say in the way student\nviews are put to Government or\nanyone else. A vote for a referendum on December 7 will\nallow democratic discussion\nabout NUS, will allow all students to have a say; and\nre affiliation will bring us back\ninto the community of students;\nwill give us more NUS benefits\nand will improve the running of\nour student union. Our era of\nparasitism will be over.\nVote for a Referendum on Dec 7\nPhilip Nathan\nBiochem 3\nIC Liberals\nFELIX1 November 19, 1982 Page7\n\n"
