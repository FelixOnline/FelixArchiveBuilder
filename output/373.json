This one inevitably\nhas to be less exuberant, less en-thus i a stic, less energetic than the first\nterm, for now is the time that many\nstudents realise that their academic\nwork is the fundamental reason why\nthey are at TC in the first place. Now is\nthe time to be devouring that back-log\nof problem sheets and final ising that\nproject before writing it up. It'sapa in, I know, but it is a necessary torture\nwhich we all have to go through.\nBut whilst many are resolved to pin their proverbial shoulder to the grindstone there are others with their minds\non other things such as the contribution\nthey feel they are capable of making to\nthe Union year possibly as a member of\nthe Union hierarchy.\nTowards the end of this term some\nhardy souls will vie for the four Union posts which are elected by means of a college-wide ballot. The posts are the\nPresident, Deputy President, Hon.\nSecretary and the Editor of FELIX. All except the DP are sabbatical which means that the post becomes a full-time job for a year with no academic\nwork. Each post is open to any full\nmember of ICU with the exception that\nno sabbatical officer can stand for\nanother sabbatical.\nNow is the time to consider the\npossibility of standing not only for these\nposts but for each and every post that\nexists in this Union. Do not be put off by those whose minds\nare already made up and who wish to\npublicise that fact.\nRegarding the alleged attitude of the\nNUS to the IRA, does it not strike\nanyone at all odd that whilst vehemently\ndenying that the NUS supported the IRA, Mr. John Randall the President, did not\ntake any initiative whatsoever to condemn the recent IRA bombings? The\nopportunity for him to do so was there\nbut he did not take it. Again one must\nexpress one's curiosity at the fact that\nmuch of the NUS policy on the Irish\nsituation coincides with the aims of the\nIRA.' But before all the IC lefties jump up\nand throw their arid eloquence at me,\nlet me just say that I'm not condemning\nJohn Randall \u2014 I'm just not taking the\nopportunity to support him.\nBeit Hall,\nJan 6th,1975. Dear Sir,\nIn this year of high inflation\nit is nice to know there is something else free besides\nfresh air.\ni We used to pay for FELIX, yet now he is free and more\nhandsome. Having known FELIX all his life, and followed him\nthrough many changes, I wish to\ncongratulate you on his 25th anniversary colourful edition.\nI am still in possession of many\nold editions of FELIX. \u2022 After I was de mobbed from\nthe army at Christmas 1945, I came to Be it Hall in January\n1946, as a porter. I was\nintroduced to the cleaning\nstaff, and six months later\nmarried one of them.\nPARKING\nThere are still people who\nhave not collected their parking\npermits. If these are not\ncollected before the end of\nJanuary they will be forfeit ted and the places reallocated.\ni My wife started at Old Be it in 1926, and is still working at\nBe it Hall with me. We have been\nvery happy working with the\nstudents, and shall miss them\nvery much when we retire in the not-too-distant future. We\nhave seen great changes in student dress, appearance,\nmoods etc., but all through the\nyears we have found them most\ncourteous and respectful to us.\niI have a mention in your\narticle by Dave Salisbury '25\nYears of Residence', John Owen\nwould clean shoes for 6d. and\nsponge and press suits for\nl/6d. The name is not John\nOwen but John Roden and 3d.a pair was charged for shoes,\n2/6d. charged for pressed\ndinner suits. i Miss Sherwood who we\nworked with many years was a wonderful lady and a great\nasset to the smooth running of\nBe it Hall. She was much\nconcerned with the welfare of\nthe students, especially the\ngirls.\ni Long live FELIX. Yours sincerely,\nJ. Roden.\nFELIX \u00a9\nMichael J. L.

    "content": "THE VOLUNTARY LEVY\nThe original agreement by which the\nso - called\" voluntary levy\" was setup, has been discovered to be worded in such away, that rather than35 pence\nper week being paid to a particular fund by each occupant of Hall or House, as distinct from arent payment,\n35 pence of the rent paid is diverted to a fund for new building. That is to\nsay, the weekly rent bill for a room in Southside is NOT \u00a3 4 . 4 0 , plus a levy of35 p., but it is \u00a3 4 . 7 5 , 3 5 p. of which goes\ninto a fund. Thus, it is clear that there is nothing\" voluntary\" about the levy. Given this, there are at present, no grounds for the wit holding of any part of this term's rent, and students who\nhave not yet paid, are advised to do so. Under the mandate of the UGM of9 th. Jan,I am now proceeding to terminate the\nagreement, so that no part of the rent bill is diverted to the purpose of building. "

    "content": "a Eco aps Jack Llewellyn Planxty: Cold Blow and the Rainy\nNight (Polydor).\nTHIS HAS to be one of the best\ncollections of Irish folk tunes around at\nthe moment. Each reel, polka, air and jig have an enormous depth of character: the\nlyrics seem to step right out of the\npages of the last century and the music\nhas the magical charm of a leprechaun,\nlittle hat a n'all.I have become totally\nengrossed with this record ever since I first played it, for each track has such a sparkling ring of olde world e exuberance\nthat it becomes difficult to close one's mind to the melodies long after the stereo\nhas been switched off.\nSome of the best qu ts include Johnny\nCope (a song & horn pipe). Cold Blow\n&c( the title track) and The Little\nDrummer; but undoubtedly the best of all is the last track The Green Fields of\nCanada which as an emigration song, is\nunusual in as much that the emigre\nappears to believe that he has done the\nright thing. It is slow, introspective and\nlyrically moving with the guitar playing\na haunting melody supported by beautiful,\nalmost in di gene ou sly Irish harmony.\nFleetwood Mac: Heroes Are Hard To\nFind (Reprise).\nTHIS IS Fleetwood Mac's first album\nsince they decided to settle in Los Angeles permanently and although the\nadvertising blurb says that it '...is more\ncomplex in its concept than anything\nthey've done before', I fail to see how\nFM can be categorised as anything other\nthan conventional.\nHowever, there are definite signs that\nthe band has set its sights on a broader\nscope as regards presentation. Several\nof the tracks try to break away from the\ntold intro-verse'Chorus-verse-chorus-end\ntriteness and even drummer Mick Fleet wood showed us that he' s capable of more\nthan the usual thump-diddy-thump on\ntracks such as Sad Loser and Safe\nHarbour.\nMelodically, the Mac have always\nbeen pretty strong and side two must\nrate as a triumph in anybody's books:\nShe's Changing Me, Silver Heels and\nespecially Prove Your Love shine through\nas the highlights of the album.\nBOOKS\nRichard Adams: Watership Down\n(Penguin).\nTHIS* IS a beautiful book, destined to\nbecome a classic. Its story is beautifully\ntold bringing the wonder of the English Countryside with its plants and animals\nto life with such vividness that you can\nalmost smell the grass.\nTaken on its simplest level the book\nis a fairy story concerning a group of\nrobb its who decide to leave their warren\nReturn to Forever featuring Chick\nCorea: Where Have I Known You\nBefore (Polydor).\n\u2022WE STARTED Return to Forever\nwith the Idea of bringing good music to a lot of people', says Chick Corea. And he's damn right. After several years of\nhard graft, ironing out the inevitable\nproblems of technique in elitist seclusion, this group have naturally fused into a jazz combo of the highest quality. Having\nsatisfied their art-for-art's sake ambitions\nand established their credentials in\ncontemporary terms they kick off their\nonslaught into the world of jazz with a new premise: to communicate with their\naudiences rather than have them analyse\nthe music. Drummer Lenny White achieves some\nastounding entries \u2014 practically ghosting\nout of nowhere with a firm grip on the\ntempo whilst the almost legendary bassist Stanley Clarke continues substantiating\nhis position as Melody Maker. Jazz bassist of 1974. The newest member of\nthe group, Al DiMeola, emphasises his competence on the guitar and the big C himself shows just what keyboard\nvirtuosity is all about.\nRarified improvisational fusion?\nBullsh. This is a new slant on jazz. It's good.\nBarclay James Harvest: Barclay\nJames Harvest Live (Polydor).\nBARCLAY JAMES HARVEST must be\none of the few groups around who are\ncapable of reproducing the excellence of\na studio recording on a live recording, for\ntry though I might, I could detect very\nfew 'bum' notes and hardly any mismatch of instrumental tone-balance.\nRecording engineers can only do so much,\nso it is a tribute to BJ H's professionalism\nthat this double-album is so acoustically\nsuperb.\nSeveral of the tracks (including The\nGreat 1974 Mining Disaster, Negative\nEarth, Paper Wings, For No One and\nCrazy City) are taken from their last\nalbum 'Everyone is Everybody Else'.\nHowever, if you prefer songs which are\nextended, ex tempor is ed and developed to\nthe full as opposed to the clipped,\ncommercial 3'A minute spiel then this\nalbum is definitely worth checking out.\nRichard War ing and undertake the hazardous journey to\nfound a new colony. The adventures they\nhave on the way, their success, their\nsearch for does, and the eventual outcome\nall follow naturally and be liev ably. On a higher level allegorical interpretations are possible. As an example,\nthe way 'our heroes' act towards other\nrabbits they encounter mirrors human\nbehaviour and ideals. Wj 1\n1 those who behave\nin the most commendable manner win in\nthe end? You' ll have to read the book to\nfind out.\nGraham Central Station: Graham\nCentral Station (Warner Bros).\nTHIS RECORD leaves me completely\nin two minds. After listening to the first\nside iron-willed determination was\nrequired in order to prevent the formation\nof a localised concentration of plastic somewhere in the region of Prince's Gardens. Nevertheless, side two was ar elevation indeed: 'Tis Your Kind of\nMusic has a synthesis er introduction,\nplayed by the band's leader, Larry\nGraham, which shows a depth of maturity\nin the concept of 'funk'; and the final\ntrack, Today, provides one Her shall Happiness with the opportunity to\ndemonstrate his confident expertise on\nthe clarinet. These two tracks stand head\nand shoulders above the others, which\nmight easily be construed as space-filling. Storming the Southern States at the\npresent time is all very well, but an\nalbum such as this, which is to be\nreleased prior to their British and\nEuropean tour, should really have\nadvertised the band's undoubted talents\n(after all, their roots are in Sly and the\nFamily Stone and Billy Preston's band)\non a broader spectrum and not present\nsuch banality as side one.\nOsibisa: The Best of Osibisa (MCA).\nClearly designed as a sampler for\nlisteners new to Os ibis a rather than a collector's item, The Best of Osibisa is\na collection of nine tracks from those\nOs ibis a albums produced in 1971-72. The\ninimitable sound that is Os ibis a shines\nthrough effortlessly with this highly\nrepresentative selection. However, 'criss-cross rhythms that\nexplode with happiness' can become\napproximately painful after a while -the group never seem able to slow up at\nall. Most tracks incorporate a tempo\nwhich seems to be ob liga tori ly fast-moving and one feels that their repertoire\ncould do with just a small jab of\nmelancholy at times.\nUndoubtedly the best track is\n'Beautiful Seven' which uses thunderstorm sound effects at the beginning plus\na superbly reverberating flute which is\na stunning combination.\nA good buy for those uninitiated to\nOs ibis a. All through the book nature is displayed\nwith great accuracy, almost reverence.\nThe style is in places almost documentary;\nI gained the impression I was reading a true history. Even the concept of rabbits\ncommunicating as though by speech\nseemed quite in place.\nI say again: This is a beautifully\nwritten and intensely moving story which\nis held together right to the last word by\na powerful imagination that seen forbids\ndisbelief.\nContinued on page 7\n\n"

    "content": "mix PiG AFFAIRS CORNER Tom Abraham\nTIME AND again, in conversations with postgraduates from a number of departments, I have been confronted with tales of\ncomplete disillusionment with their projects and supervisors.\nNo postgraduate can openly complain about his project, because\nof his total dependance on the supervisor for the degree. The\nsystem is such that no matter\nwhat, the i nd iv i dual postgraduate\nis bound to lose. In spite of\nthis, I feel that the postgraduate\ngroup should openly confront\nthis issue. In doing so, I want\nto make it clear that we do not\nseek a confrontation with the\nacademic staff. All we wish to\ndo is to discuss ways and\nmeans of improving the existing system.\nIt has been suggested to me\nthat a charter on postgraduate\nresearch work should be drawn\nup and presented to the college authorities. Presumably among\nthe points that could be put\nforward are:\n1. The total responsibility\nshould rest with the supervisor\nfor providing the student with\na research subject.\n2. A certain amount of preliminary research should have\nalready been carried out to\ncertify the feasibility of work\non that topic.\n3. The supervisor should keep\nin touch and be aware of the\nstate of the student's research.\n4. Possibly greater help\nshould come from the technical\nstaff in setting up the necessary\napparatus.\nAny such charter should be\nbinding on both student and\nsupervisor. The points raised\nhere are mainly for discussion. The best way to tackle the\nissue would be for the initial\ndiscussion to be carried out at\ndepartmental groups level,\nwith the IC postgraduate group\ndiscussing it at a general\nmeeting sometime in the middle\nof the term \u2014 hopefully the final\ndraft of the charter can be\nformulated at this meeting.\nImperial College\nFolk Song Club\nWednesday, Jan.15 th TROT TO Medieval and traditional\ndance music on hammer\ndulcimer, fiddle, rebec\nand guitar.\nUnion Lower Refectory\n7.30pm The question of whether the\nPG Affairs Officer (who is also chairman of the IC Postgraduate\nGroup) should be a member of\nthe Union exec or not, is\nfinally coming up at the U GM.A number of postgraduates\nhave complained to me about the\nlack of adequate representation\nwithin the Union, and some\nhave been in favour of a 'go\nit alone' policy. I am totally\nopposed to this since I feel\nthat we stand to gain a lot by\nworking within the framework\nprovided by ICU. However, the\nfull benefits cannot and will not be felt unless postgraduates\nare willing to take a more active\npart in Union affairs. Although\nlast year's Union executive\ntended to ignore postgraduates\nthis year's exec have been\nmore favourably disposed. some-Julia have\nNow to write about\nthing more interesting!\nDunning and the girls\nbeen complaining about the way\nthe fellows (namely the under-grads) treat them. Is y mpa this e with their feelings and what's more, shall suggest a solution\nto their problems. The solution\ncomes in the form of post grads. They are more mature, more\nintelligent, more tolerant, more\nunderstanding, more a ffe c tion ate, more perceptive, more loving\nand altogether more desirable\ncreatures than undergrads.\nThere are 1600 of them at IC,\nand although half of them are\nmarried or living with girl-friends, it still leaves BOO of\nthem to choose from. So girls,\nignore the undergraduate rabble,\nand start associating with real\nmen.\nFinally, the Christmas lunch\nwas very well attended. My\napologies to those who were\nturned away at the door. Our\nmain event this term will be\nthe Postgraduate dinner. This would be the first time we've\nhad one, and depending on how\nsuccessful it is, we could make\nit into an annual affair. I would\nlike to end by thanking all those who helped make the\nChristmas lunch such a success, especially John Porter, Paul Newton, Phil Ryipon and\nRichard Upton, not forgetting\nM CP, Glen Tic, Frankie boy\nand all the other level\nseven ites.\nILogal College of Science Bnion\nrequest the pleasure of your company,\nat it's regular function:\n' Tuesday Night Out' Commencing on January 14th, trips to skating rinks, bowls, cinemas,\nplays, concerts, etc. will be arranged.\nSpecific information to be found on\nposters and scatter sheets.

Darts, boat races, sing song.\nT.M.& STUDENT LIFE\nA student's life is good, but there Is just one drawback -having to study. There are many possibilities open to us and\nalso requirements which we have to fulfill. The main question is\nhow to make full use of our own potential as students: How to\nfind the best parties, the cheapest bars; to manage with the\ngrant; and obviously how to\nsucceed in exams with the\nleast work possible. So, what does all this have\nto do with Transcendental\nMeditation (TM)? From the\nexperience of over 300 students\nwho learnt the technique of TM in the last 3-4 years in IC and\nfrom the experience of over\n8,000 students who have learnt\nTM from all over England, it\nseems that there are many\nbenefits for students. And the\nproof is that more and more\nstudents are learning it, most of\nthem because of a 'meditating'\nfriend. What are the benefits?\nMainly they fit into three\ncategories: the mind, health\nand social life.\nFor the mind, it's found that\nafter practising TM for 15-20\nminutes twice a day, thinking\nability and organisation of\nmemory improve considerably.\nThis means that one can learn\nthings easily and in a short\ntime. Students claim that as a result of practising TM, learning\nbecomes such an automatic and\nspontaneous thing \u2014 they can concentrate without any real\neffort. (The technique is\neffortless and doesn't demand\nany concentration). These\nclaims agree with the scientific research done on students\nwhich indicates: increased\nintelligence growth rate,\nincreased learning ability, improved academic performance\netc.\n.The second type of benefit\nis in- the, field of health. IC\nmed it at or s' say that they are\nmore relaxed, less ill and feel\nfresh and alert throughout the\nday. This enables them to enjoy\nthe bar, parties, or just sitting quietly indoors and listening to\nmusic or watching TV. The last category into which the benefits fall is social relationships. Meditators find\nthat they feel better about\nthemselves and therefore their\nattitude towards others improves.\nNot only do they find improvements in their relationships\nwith their own college friends\nbut also with members of the\nopposite sex (ask the girls who\ncome to the TM Soc parties).\nCelia and Rosalind, two\nbeautiful girls who teach TM in the college, tell us from their\nexperience that TM cj in be\nlearnt by everyone. Celia told\nme: 'Anyone who can think\ncan meditate' and according to\nher, the benefits are immediate\nand don't require years of\npractice.\nFor further information just\ndrop in on one of the introductory\ntalks. The next one Is on\nTuesday, January 14th, at\n1p.m. In Elec. Eng. Room 406.\n\n"

The extent of this commando styled mission may be\njudged by the fact that it took\nthem three weeks to plan, prepare and carry out the\noperation, the principals involved being their locksmith'\nand 'heavy movement' depart-ment s. They had to go through\nsome locked doors and a locked\nsteel cabinet before being able\nto remove the sought after\nmascot. They achieved this\nentry without breaking any of\nthe locks.

The advert in question was\nprinted as part of a full page\nwhich called for the Army' s withdrawal from Northern\nIreland. The advert was a spoof\nof a genuine army recruitment\nad printed in the October 29th edition, using the same layout.\nSelections include: as an\n'Army Officer' you will have a good chance of becoming dead\na lot sooner .you can always blame any mistakes\n\u2014 on the workers, and shoot\nthem.\nA conservative member of the\ncollege, Robert Ingram , is reported to have sent copies to\nmembers of the Government and\nShaddow Cabinet as well as the DPP.

This is due during\nJanuary. When the report comes\nit will be considered together\nwith any strengthening schemes\nwhich may be necessary. Until then, College is not prepared,\nbecause of the risk, to allow any students to occupy the\nbuilding. I Trevor considers we must\nwait for the report. When this\nbecomes available Council and\naUG M will be consulted on\nwhat the Union attitude should\nbe.\nVoluntary Levy\nTHE UNION has issued a leaflet informing hall residents\nof the voluntary levy of 35p per week included in hall fees.\nThe object of this levy is to\nraise money for the Student\nAdditional Residence Fund. Despite it being Union policy to\nhave a levy, Council agreed\nthat students should be free to\ndecide individually whether they\nwish to pay this levy.\nUnion has asked on a number\nof occasions that the levy be\nitem is ed separately on bills. This was agreed by College but\napparent administrative diff i cul ties have arisen which the\nUnion is trying to resolve.\nIt has been claimed by some\nstudents that the levy is entirely useless and an unnecessary financial burden, as\nat present rates of inflation\nthe fund cannot be built up\nquickly enough ever to finance\nthe building of a new hall, viz. the failure of the Northside\nproject.\nUnion suggests that residents\nreserve payment until at the\nearliest, Monday, January 13th. It is believed the levy will have\nbeen discussed at last nights\nU GM. "

There is no charge to ICU members, although a deposit may sometimes be required against damage, etc.' If you book a room, PLEASE read the form carefully before\nsigning it. In some cases you may be asked to return later,\nwhen you' ll be told whether or not the booking is accepted.\nIf a deposit is required, you must pay it at least 24 hours\nbefore the event. A cheque would be required even earlier.\nFailure to pay the deposit in time will result in the\ncancellation of the booking.\nLastly, if you want to have a party, or any noise y event,\ngoing on late, you will be wasting your time applying for any\nday but Friday or Saturday. The best party room in College\nis the Quiet Room, Level 0, College Block. This room is sound proofed and can be booked through the Day Bookings\nOffice in College Block. UNION TELE RETURNS.\nWelcome news for those who like a good pint with their\nviewing, is the open img of the new TV Room in the Union\nbuilding. The room, on the third floor, next to the Snooker\nRoom, is to be refurnished as soon as possible.

He' s related to what yer might call the Legal Beagle\nfam'ly - them that sticks their wet noses into every th m wat\ndon't concern 'em. Now this daw g is real mean, and when I say\nTruth\nmean, I mean mean. 1 ruth is, once pon a time he cut a pretty cute little figure for the\nfolks round here, kinda way of\nlife fer us Is 'pose, but he\nsorta lost his green an' wrinkled appeal and now he\nlooks just plain mangy. Why\nhe was even nick-named Lucky fer a time on account a once\nyer had that hound on yer tail, yer luck was in. Gals at IF\nrecall when yer could live in\nnear op pcl en ce when Discretion\nwas about but now that daw g don't give nut tin' away, he\nain't nut tin' but bad luck.\nCourse, he ain't mean ta\never wan, just those that he\ndon't fancy (which is plain\nnear ever wan I reckon), that's why he' s called Discretion, see? He can just as easy bite\nthe hand wat feeds him as the\none he don't like the smell of.\nPursonally, I put the blame on\nhis ol' master LEA. Yer know,\ntime was when Lea loved that\ndaw g like he was his own, give him awl the best cuts\nand saw that that critter was right prop url y fed, ev' n patted\nhim in pub li k( and that did Lea's image no end o' good\n'cos thar ain't nut tin' folks\nlike so much as an an mal lover) but tragedy is that now\nLea ain't got no time fer that\ndaw g \u2014 too busy count in' his pennies Is 'pose, ol' god gold\nhas takin hold, yer might say, an' thrown hurl in' ster l in\"\nright outta the win der, leavin'\nyer poor oP Discretion with\njust the left-overs. Why that\ndaw g is so hungry he chews\ngreat holes in folks' pockets. '\nCourse, as ever, it's us hilly fillies here at IF wat are\nsuffer in' the most, on account a that hound is seek in' fer to get\nback at us. He' s an-eye in' up\nall our ankles just so's he can\nbite ' em. That da wg's meanness\nain't gonna end fer a long time\nt 'come.\nHaving grabbed your eyeBalls\nby the scruff of the iris and\nbrought them this far how about\nFIONA CASS1DY. a second-year Mineswoman, came into\nthe limelight towards the end\nof last term when, against\nvery strong opposition, she\nwas crowned as the IC Carnival Queen for this session.\nWe wish her every future\nsuccess.\nAlbert's Plum(S. Ken. Stn.)\nCut Price 5 5 p3 course meal to\nIC Students\n(Discotheque till 3 a. in.) straightening your mouth and\nconsidering the very real\nproblems posed by the\nDiscretionary Award System?\nAll grants of this nature are\ngrossly unjust because as there\nis no national policy stipulating\nthat LEA's should make such an\naward available in such and\nsuch a case, there can be no\nhard and fast rules regarding\nthe award itself. Of course as it is left to the whim of the LEA, who under the present squeeze\nis rather obliged to follow the\nGovernment's example in cutting\neducational expenditure, one\nmay imagine that discretionary\nawards are the first to be\naffected.\nMany LEA's flatly refuse to\noffer discretionary awards to\ngirls at IF and it seems that as\nthis trend is catching on more\nand more potential applicants\nare looking elsewhere. At present\nthere are 200 girls at IF as\ncompared with 250 last year.\nWhilst one may argue that weare not entitled to an award as\nsubstantial as the university\ngrant, one must point out that\nthe vast majority of girls at IF\nfulfill university entrance\nrequirements.\nIt is undoubtedly true that\nbecause of its situation, because\nof the duration and the high\nstandard of the course and a number of other combining\nfactors, the Institut Francais is one of the most expensive\ncourses of its type. However,\nby withdrawing or cutting back\non financial aid to the students\nhere, the LEA's are jeo pardi sing the very existence of the\nInstitut Francais, and consequently the quality of the\nfuture bi-lingual and multilingual secretary.\nIn a country currently riddled\nwith economic crises and\nincreasingly dependent on strong diplomatic and economic\nrelations with abroad, it is\nessential that the LEA's cease to regard us as lia b iIi ties and look on us as the investments that we are, for\ninternational communication,\nwhich we at IF are dealing in,\nis at the very basis of our\ncountry's future survival.\n\n"

Prior to the course, another\npilot went solo, but as he\nalready possessed a PPL( private pilots licence) for\npowered aircraft, one could hardly class him as a novice.\nThanks are due to the instructors\nwho gave their time to run the\ncourse.\nMeanwhile, the so called pundits, took the Skylark\n(No. 296) on an expedition to\nScotland to hill and wave soar.\nDespite the fact that Christmas\nday was spent peering into the\nmir k with high winds and heavy\nrain lashing the clubhouse,\nsome flying was done by all during the week. The Bishop Hill at Portmoak provided\nseveral hours of hill soaring,\nand the northerly winds on\nBoxing day enabled some wave\nflying to be undertaken.\nThanks are due to our hosts at\nPortmoak aerodrome who not\nonly allowed us to fly 296, but\nal wo their Swallow and Pir at.

CANOE CLUB OCTOBER18 th saw the Canoe Club set out on its first major\ntrip of the term, the annual trip to the river Wye at Symonds Yat.\nWe arrived at midnight, 2 hours ahead of schedule, and tried to\nfind the grassiest bit of mud to pitch the tents on. Saturday\nmorning, well before sunrise we arose and, after several hours of\nhesitation, took to the water.\nWe then paddled upstream to\nthe roaring waters of Symonds\nYat rapid (Grade I). Most of the\nday was spent introducing new\nmembers to the underwater view\nof the rapid. During Saturday\nnight the river rose a foot or so\nand on Sunday the rate of\ncapsize had greatly increased.\nAn overall capsize rate of 75%\nwas achieved.\nOn Saturday the9 th November, eleven canoes and ten people\npiled into a van and drove to\nBedford for the Bedford Handicap\nLong Distance Race. We arrived\nearly enough to give ourselves\ntwo hours to find the start.\nThis turned out to be the most\ndifficult part of the race, but\nwe eventually located a group\nof wet looking canoeists\nlistening to the course briefing.\nThe race was started with the\nslowest boats (under-16 girls)\noff first and the fastest (Senior\nK2) leaving almost half an hour\nlater. We all set off in our\nrespective classes, through the\nnew cut, to the-first wie r where\ntwo of the team had a quick\nswim. Much refreshed they\ncarried on and a couple of wi ers later found a scouts' canoe\nblocking a lock shut e, forcing\nmost people to portage. The\nrace ended after two more wi ers and a few more miles. Bob Joce won and Tim Perry came\nthird in senior class3 and\nDiana came second in Ladies slalom. The rest of the results\nare not yet available .\nA week later we set off on\nour annual trip to the river Exe for the Exe Descent race.\nAvoiding the many (four) pil eup s on the way, we arrived at\nour lodgings and all of us\npiled into one bed. On Saturday\nmorning we set off to inspect\nthe course and pubs. Four people actually went canoeing,\ntwo of them having a pleasant\ndip while experimenting with\nrapids. The evening was spent\nin the pub and afterwards in our\ncommunal bed. On Sunday\nmorning we wandered through a ploughed field to the start of\nthe race which was just above\nTiverton. Ten wi ers, many\nrapids and nineteen miles later\nwe found the finish. All the IC paddlers finished well up some\nfinishing rather wetter than\nothers. Bob Joce managed 7th, Tim Perry 10th and Dave\nRosenthal 17th out of a record\nnumber of entries. The rest of\nthe team finished in the top\nhalf of the field. J. Hubbard\n( Ex. Chem. Eng.) won the\nsenior K2 class again. The\nUL U paddlers did not do so\nwell and smashed one of their\ntwo boats in half.\nThe next important competition that IC paddlers are\ninvolved in is the British Universities Down River Race on the Dee. We wish them the\nbest of luck.\nWe still session in have a coaching\nthe pool every\nTuesday 6.30 - 8.00p.m. All are we l com*., "

    "content": "FELIX\nCandi\nRobert Phillips (Ed.): Aspects of\nAlice (Penguin).\nIF I were taking bets on it, I'd reckon\nthat you had read Alice's Adventures in\nWonderland and Through the Looking\nGlass at some time in the past. You may\nhave read them recently, but most probably\nyou remember them from some time ago.\nAnyway, you' ll know what I'm talking\nabout, for no other books have had such a pervasive influence on the English idiom\nor played as great a part in convincing\noutsiders that the English are nuts. If you\nhaven't read them recently, get hold of a copy and do it now, preferably after\nthumbing through a copy of 'Aspects of\nAlice'. After all, did you on your first\nreading appreciate the pun when Alice is\nintroduced to a leg of mutton? She immediately asks the Red Queen if she shall cut her a slice. 'Certainly not', answers the Red\nQueen, 'it isn't etiquette to cut anyone\nyou've been introduced to'.\n\u2022 Aspects of Alice points out this and\nmany more references to Victorian upbringing and childhood, gives in full the\nforgotten poems which Lewis Carroll\nparodied, and throws a deal of light onto\nCharles L. Dodgson. It really is worth its\nweight in gold; not just for the spread and\nscope of the essays, the information\npresented and the carefully annotated\nnotes, but for its intrinsic value as first\nclass criticism. The opinions of the various authors\ncould not differ more widely, and range\nfrom whether the Alice books were really\nwritten by Mark Twain to analogies with\nthe acid-taking experience. And in between we find J.B. Priestley' s caustic remarks on Humpty Dumpty. Walter de la\nMare's careful and thought-provoking\nreview, and stacks of conjectures from\nFreudian hang-ups, p hallie and pigs to\nDon Quixote.\nPersonally I found myself most in\nagreement with R.L. Green in his sensible assessment of what Lewis Carroll was\ntrying to do. As he says, extremely\ncareful allegory is not the work of the\nsubconscious mind, and although I would\nbe the first to agree that there is much of\nC.L. Dodgson' s life in Carroll, most of the\nattempts (and there have been so many)\nto relate Alice to anything are difficult to\nswallow the day after, however convincing\nthey appear on the first reading.\nWhole Earth Epilog (Penguin)\nIF YOU have seen the Last Whole\nEarth Catalog, then you've seen the\nEpilog. The same format, another folk y story that I couldn't be bothered to read\nand a few rudi es to shock the sort of\npeople who like to give educational\nChristmas presents. As someone is quoted\nas asking: 'Are you guys the symptom or\ncure? Put it another way, there war,\nnothing wrong with dinosaurs, was there?'.\nHaving said that, I must confess that\nthere is a deal of useful information in the\nEpilog (like the Catalog), and that I enjoy\njust leafing through. Lots of ideas, which\nare what count, but still inevitably\nAmerican stuff, so hard for us to get hold\nof without paying astronomical freight\ncharges.\nI hope that we aren't going to see an\nEpilog year (Too much, man), but it would\nbe great to have an European version.\nIs Bath working on it?\nOne last injunction: don't be put off b v the cover, get yourself a copy and keep\nit within reach because this is a book\nthat you' ll want to keep dipping into for a long time to come.\n0\nOP\nS AT11 th LEO SAYER\n1.20 i cad vI.50 on door\nrues KthBt^fesT l MITE Sffaadv 60pondo orO^\"S ATf8 th LlNDISFARNE\nI.20 ic adv I.40 on door\nTICKETS AVAILABLE FROM UNION OFFICE EVERY WEEKDAY LUNCHTIME.\nIC STUDENT DISCOUNT ONLY GIVEN ON PRODUCTION OF REGISTRATION CARD\n(2 TICKETS ONLY)\nDISCO EVERY FRIDAY ONLY lOp\nin union lower refectory 8-11-30pm FILMS THUR9 th Hie mechanic eve lk nie vel THUR16 thr rip le echo Hie don is dead\nALL FILMS SHOWN IN MECK ENG. 220 AT 6-30pi "
