    "content": "2 - FELIX,16 th DECEMBER,1976 PG AFFAIRS CORNER\nletters to the editor Parkers PG\nIndia Soc. reply\nDear Sir, \u2014 With reference to Mr\nRamendra Gu ha's letter printed\non 3rd Dec'76, I feel his accusations about India Society\nare completely baseless. He has only managed to display his ignorance.\nHe accuses the Society for\nputting up posters, 'here and\nthere; but they are few and far\nbetween'. He doesn't know that\nthis is exactly what union rules\nrequire us to do. Furthermore\nthis is an establishment for\nvery intelligent people, so I believe reading one poster with\nsuffice nt information should\nwell suffice his requirements. I cannot see why Mr Guha wants\nto see, say, 16 similar posters\nstuck on a wall saying the\nsame thing. In a big place like IC no less than 50 posters\nwere put up for India Soc's film show and the fresher s' party.\nFor the same function,\nindividual letters were sent\nout by our sec ra try to all the\nmembers \u2014 Mr Guha is one. If\n121 other members received it, I fail to see how Mr Guha was missed on three occasions. He also says 'after all it\ncosts nothing' (to send put\nindividual letters to club members). This is absolutely\nridiculous.. We have spent about\n\u00a335.00 alone on publicity so far, most of it on paper. In\naddition a lot of personal\neffort goes- into making these\nposters and addressing to ALL MEMBERS. In my 8 years work with\nvarious social organisations,\nI 've come across many people\nlike Mr Guha who like to s it back and criticize. I have\nappealed on various occasions for a second publicity officer.\nIf Mr Guha feels he can do a better job,I have one waiting\nfor him. I always welcome\nent hua stic members who like\nto see a better society. I can be contacted via Mech Eng letter rack or fn person at Room\n806 Mech Eng( internal 3619).\nNIP SHAH Chairman India Soc\n9 December 1976\nPG common room\nDear Sir, \u2014 In answer to Mr\nGuha, ( FELIX3 rd Dec) and\nfor the interest of other PG s reading the magazine, the IC postgraduate group is at present\ninvestigating the possibility of\nobtaining a common-room for\nPG s. The first step is to find\nout if such a room is wanted by\nthe majority of PG s at IC. So\nif anyone is interested, could\nthey please contact either\nmyself (on Int 2263) or their own\ndepartmental reps as soon as possible and make their views known.\nYours faithfully\nKATE DUC IEI CUP GG Secretary\nExec. Nutterings\nDear Sir, \u2014 I appreciate that in certain circumstances it is not\nwithin your pri vele ge to fundamentally alter articles. However,\nI feel that publishing two\nparagraphs written by different\nmembers of the Executive, both\nentitled ' NUS Referendum\n(last week's issue,) when they\nare in direct opposition is\nperhaps indiscreet.\nIn point of fact it is interesting that 2 sabbaticals obviously\ndo not consult each other before\nputting pen to paper.\nI. would be grateful if someone would inform me when I will be able to exercise my\ndemocratic rights.\nYours sincerely, DAVE DODGE,R CSU Malicious attack\non Mary A Dear Sir, \u2014 The motion which\nwas to be proposed by P Ide at the last U GM was a flagrant\nattack on the right of all ICU members to take an active part\nin running their union.\nI um amazed that the Union\nExecutive distributed copies of\nthis motion around the College, appalled that Mary Attenborough\nwas \u2014 the subject of the\nmotion \u2014 was not informed\nbeforehand that the motion had\nbeen proposed.\nThe inclusion of this motion,\nwhether it is seen as a malicious\nattack on one member of 1CU or as a sick joke, is clearly not\nconducive to serious Union\ndebate.\nIt is not coincident i al that\nthe motion attacked a woman\nstudent of IC; and the motion's implication is clear: that\nwomen are not expected to put\nforward arguments as clearly\nand forcefully as Mary Attenborough does., From this P Ida has drawn\nthe conclusion that women who\ndo stand up for their beliefs, Chinese Society\nDear Sir, \u2014 I would like to\ndraw the attention of Chinese Society members to the recent\nunexpected cancellation of\nCambridge trip previously\nscheduled for I1t hDec. It was\nthen claimed to be the consequence of 'poor response' from\nthe members.\nLet's face the facts, there\nwere no posters, and only a few line written down somewhere in the corner of the\nprevious society circular; that's all. Though we were offered a few names to contact, these\npeople \u2014 who were supposed to\nbe responsible for selling tickets \u2014 did not even know\nthey had been picked for the\njob.\nI would also like to remind\nyou that whilst other Chinese Societies in the University\nwere zealously preparing for\nLUC SC S( London University\nChinese Society Cultural\nSection) versus Mancherster\nUniversity CU game (held on\nU th Dec in Mancherster) we\ndid nothing. Is it true that as a founder member of LUC SC S, we\nhave actually d is affiliated from\nLUC SC S? So far this year\nnothing has been said about\nLUC SC S. With, no collaboration with,\nLUC SCSi s Chinese Society\nhonestly doing enough for its\nmembers under the favourite\nconditions \u2014 such as vast support from members & substantial finance at IC. Surely\nI am not the only one who feels\nthis way. Happy Xmas.\nC.K. CHEN Physics PG. must be in some way deficient\nas women. Such attitudes\nmust change if the college is to\nencourage more women to take\nup courses at IC. Yours sincerely,\nDEIR DRE LIVINGSTONE Maths 1\n1 3th December 1976\npad ling sI just realised that this\nillustrious publication is coming\nout on Thursday next week on\naccount of all these undergrads\nflaking out and running off home\nto mum's Christmas puddings.\nSo, if I am to wish anyone a happy Christmas, it will have to\nbe done very rapidly before I go\noff to paddle at Blackpool. Another NUS conference is\nwith us, and with their overdraft\nlooking almost as bad as mine,\nat \u00a391,000, it should be a very\ninteresting one.\nThe PG Cheese and Wine\nparty came and went. Turn out\nwas a little disappointing at\naround 60 people, but those that\ndid manage to resist the\ntemptation to go to 'Tommy' or\nSmoking Concert seemed to\nenjoy the evening. I must thank\nJamie for the good vibes, and Pat and Andy for running the bar. Suggestions for future\nsocials would be greatly\nappreciated. Two departments\nhave already taken advantage\nof our offers of financial aid to promote events at departmental level. Council, in its: benign generosity, gave \u00a3120 to\nto Mines Union to promote PG activities \u2014 any offers to spend\nit for them should be flung in the direction of the RSMU\noffice.\nFees protests\nYou will all know by now\nthat fees for PG s are to rise\nnext year to \u00a3750 (\u00a3850 for\noverseas PG s). The Friday\nbefore last I helped to deliver\naround 1,400 letters from this\ncollege protesting against these\n.proposals. They were laid in\nYhe hallway of Mrs Shirley\nWilliams' house at 8.00am on a very cold morning. We were\nlater able to see Mrs Williams\nover coffee and discuss our grievances.She was sympathetic\nbut conceded very little. I'd like to thank all those who signed letters, and I hope you will all be prepared to put pen\nto ink again next year. I would\nparticularly like to hear from\nany PG s who anticipate real\ndifficulties when the new fees\nare enforced.\nThe Pearson report on PG Education in IC is st nl on the\ntable tor discussion: I hope that\n!he PG Group will be setting\npa small study group to look\nito it in the New Year, departmental discussion of the\nreport should also be taking\nplace in all departments \u2014 make\nsure that PG opinions are\nexpressed.\nWen it's time to wander up\nthe Golden Mile. My bucket and\nspade are all ready but I must\nremember to get a packet of\nlittle flags to put on the sand\ncastle s.I'm taking a big spade\nfor the 'bury Charles Clarke' competition.

Danny Lau, our newest star, bowled 595\nincluding a232 in one game;\ntruly outstanding play.\nThe 2nds and 3rds whilst\ntook their first game but did not\nmaintain their quality in the\nrest of the match. This, together\nwith the lack of ladies, cost\nImperial the match. The result\n2\u20148 could easily have been reversed. Lou sia Chan, the\nonly lady, bowled very well for\nthe 3rds with a388 series, since\nwe were unable to field a Ladies Team. In repetition to last year it\nseems that a lack of ladies and\ninconsistent bowling by the\nj nen has cost the club many\npoints this term. With only one\nleague match left to bowl\n(against Brunei again), a good\nturnout and a determined effort\nto win may lead us to a much\nbetter result.\nSimon Spurrier\n(Captain)\nThe Captain of Imperial\nCollege Orienteering Cl nb, David Rosen, is on the short\nlist of probables for the team\nfor the World Orienteering\nChampionships to be held in\n1978.\nI ANAL VEY One cold and frosty morning\n(last Saturday 11th Dec) IC ladies Boat Club arrived en\nmasse at UL Boathouse in\nChiswick. After waiting Yi hour\nfor our opponents the UL Winter IV' s began. First to\nrace were our novice ' A' team\nwho won their heat by 2\nlengths to get through to their\nsemifinal. Our college' B' crew\nwere next to boat but unfortunately went out to Queen Mary\nCollege. After a quick changeover of\nboats the College' A' crew\njust lost to University College's who were then disqualified as\nthey weren'tall novice! So,\nboth our novice crews were\nthrough to the semifinals, and\nthe college ' A' crew to the\nfinals. Our novice ' A' crew\nbeat Barts II easily, and the\nnovice ' B' crew narrowly lost\nto QM C. After a break for lunch, during\nwhich we tried to hide our nerves\nthe novices rowed first and\ntook the lead from the start to\nbeat QM C by 3 lengths. Unfortunately the college final did not\ngo so well with the college' A' crew beating QM C but lagging\nbehind UC by 2 lengths at the\nfinish.

    "content": "FELIX, DECEMBER16 th19769 IC Dramsoc: \" The Flies\" by Jean-Paul\nSartre (directed by Sallyann Kronbergs).\nThe choice of this play for Dramsoc to\nperform is suspect, for 'The Flies' is nothing less than a vehicle for the author's existentialist theories which tend to throw\nargument and reason to the four winds in favour of total commit t ment to personally\ncontrived ethics. Presenting one's own ideas through the medium of a play is, of\ncourse, perfectly legitimate, but where as at an open debate on the subject one can heckle and oppose to one's heart's content,\na play requires poi it e silence to be observed.\nThe facile plot is that young Orestes has returned home after a fifteen year\na bse no e; defying religion and morality\n\u2014 as represented by Zeus, \u2014 he proceeds\nto assassinate the usurping monarch ( his father's murder) and his consorting mother;\nall without feeling a trace of remorse.\nIncredible? Just a bit. Written in 1943\nwhen France was overrun by Germany, it fashionably embodied the partisan spirit\nof French resistance and it was inevitably\nsuppressed by the occupying forces.\nOnly a glimmer of extent i al is m Historically inaccurate, the play is strategically made uncomplicated so that the\nexistentialism of Orestes, a straightforward\nethics revisionist, can shine brightly\nthrough. I only saw a glimmer of it.\nAs Orestes, Andy Middleton had a difficult and demanding task. All credit to\nhim for managing so well. His voice carried,\nbut physically he appeared too stiff and too\nstatic. In the scene where he has just\nkilled Aegisthens and asks Electra where\nhis mother's room is \u2014 so that he can kill her as well \u2014 he sounded like someone out\nfor a drink, asking where the next pub was. As Orestes' tutor, Manu Duggal seemed\nagain unconvincing as our anti-hero's aging mentor. Eric Stove ll, as Zeus, gave\nDramsoc has talent &\ndirection - all it needs\nis the right play\na forceful interpretation of the play's chief\nmoralist who ends up outwitted by cleverly\npresented existentialist tactics. This man's talent is beyond doubt: his lines delivered\nin various bold cadences emphasised his part as king of the gods and echoed his masterful presence on stage.\nJulia's becoming Wardrobe Electra, Orestes sister, was played by\nIF newcomer Julia Neale. She was a pleasure to watch and brought some badly\nneeded life to the play. Her costume in Act I was highly becoming (not to mention her\ncostume in Acts II and III!), so much so that at one point I almost want to climb in\nthere with her. Her varied delivery, expressions and reactions make her a must for future productions.\nAs Clytemnestra, Sarah James seemed\na little strained at times. During her first\nmeeting with Orestes, whom she did not recognise as her son, the irony of her\nquestions about his mother was not seized at all. And when mother and daughter\n(Clytemnestra and> Electra) argued in Act I,I felt no tension, no anxiety. This was no generation-gap acrimony; it was almost a polite bun fight. Superb vignettes\nPeter Ed had a very commanding presence\nas the usurper King Aegis the us. On the\nwhole an excellent performance from him\napart from one or two fluffs of lines. He\" died\" extremely competently. Special\nmention must be made of Robert Buck, who\nat first played an idiot and later played 2nd soldier. Frankly I think his character is at ions were absolutely superb vignettes. H is\nstance and animation brought vigour and\nvitality to an often grey continuum of\nmonotone.\nThe scenery was generally of a very high\nstandard. I felt that the stage in Act I would\nhave benefitted from some steps and / or a bench because in all only two characters\nactually s at down during the whole play. The columns on the mountain terrace looked\nsuperb \u2014 <a pity that they swayed when\npeople ascended the steps between them.\nThe costumes were, as usual, first class.( I'm tempted to say more about Electra' s, but I'd only be branded a lecher.)\nNo lazy mannerisms\nOnce again then, the choice of play\nmust come under fire and, inevitably, its director, Sallyann Kronbergs. It stands as testimony to the direction that not one player folded his arms, put his hands on his\nhips, put a palm to his head but instead\nlargely stood upright with his arms dangling\nlike useless, face id appendages. The pity\nof it all is' that with the likes of stove ll, Neale, Ed; Buck and others, the raw\ntalent js there. It just needs the right play.\nJ. L. Imperial College Choir, conducted by\nEric Brown.\n(Friday 10th December)\nThe task of the critic is always two-fold.\nFirstly he has a duty to inform his readers;\nthis must always be his prime function\nsince he is an employee of the newspaper\nand not of the performers. Secondly^ if the\nperformers are amongst his readers, then\nhe may try to give them helpful criticism. The events that a critic is asked to report\non also fall into two categories: those\nwhich occur only once, and those which\nare repeated and which, of course, the\nreaders will have a chance to see. In the\nlatter case the critic should fashion his review in such a way that the reader may\nmake an informed decision. Last Friday's concert is a particularly\ntricky case since I am not in a position to\nadvise readers to go to the concert; neither\nanI well-enough qualified to provide any\nconstructive criticism of the performance.\nBy its very nature the Choir .absorbs all the musical talent in the College, leaving a humble admirer who j. ust likes to hear a good sound. To those of you who feel like\nturning to the cross-country report at this\npoint may I advise you to go to the next\nconcert on 18th March and hear the Choir yourself. They are excellently trained by\nEric Brown and make a splendid noise. The\nSpecial Orchestra and Soloists are also' a great pleasure to listen to.\nThe concert opened, not with the choir,\norchestra or soloists, but with a number of\npistol shots to test the acoustics of the Emotional Kodaly livens up\nChoir's acoustic battle\nhall, with the audience as guinea pigs\nproviding the necessary acoustical surface\nfor the experiment. No doubt something will now begin to be done about the appalling acoustics of the Great Hall, which makes\nyou feel as though you need to have your\nears syringed.\nBattling against the hall the choir had\nchosen a pretty doll selection of pieces. Some years ago an Icon critic made the choir perform some livelier music. Last year they did so but thr s year's programme\nseems to have taken them back to the old\ndays. That is not to say that dull music is\nbad per se, merely that too much dull music\nis a bad thing.\nThe programme began with a particularly\nunmemorable piece from Haydn's The Seasons, appropriately Winter, which left me yearning for a rousing spring. The highlight\nof the evening was Kodaly' s Psalmus\nHungaricus with a fine tenor soloist in\nAlan Woodrow. The setting is of Psalm55, which provides admirable material, from.the\npsalmist's despair under his oppression to the joy in the thought of God's power to\nsave him. All the emotions were well put\nover by the choir.\nThe second half contained what I suppose\nwould have been described as Rossini' s answer to the Verdi Requiem had it not been\nwritten first. The work is the Stabat Mater,\na very operatic setting of a religious work.\nAs an Opera the action might have brightened things up, however there were a few\nthrills in the work, particularly in the\nclosing fugue, which unfortunately contained an uncontrolled si bill ant.

The necessity for this was ensured by sweeping absurdities covering the staff of FELIX, IC Union, and FELIX Editor, but then what else is this\npaper for I ask myself (well you weren't going to ask me were you? No! quite).\nLaughter is the best medicine, especially if it is at someone else, so why not put\nit in print and cheer up the whole college\n(except for a minority who don't know\nhow to laugh, can't read, or find them-selves mentioned somewhere in this drivel). Perhaps the editor ought to slip along to No.10 and give Jima hand to\nmake a nonsense of less sporting\nactivities.

    "content": "FOUNDED TODAY NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nNo.1 of a limited,edition of 1 Clive says Thursday (16th) but we think Friday's more likely Costly! Poor brewery supplies force Bar to switch to reliable ale source\nWatneys take over Union Bar\nSouth face climb\nreduced to closing\n-time stroll\nEarlier this week, news\nreached us that a strong team\nof Imperial climbers have finally\novercome one of the last of the\ngreat problems of the locality.\nLate last Tuesday evening, a small dedicated band of\nmountaineers reduced this\ndifficult route (the traverse of\nof the South Face of Beit\nBuilding, eastwards from the\nUnion Arch) to a mere closing time stroll.\nOne of their more prominent\nmembers has kindly provided the\nfollowing details of the expedition: \"The climb began by scaling\nthe wrought iron gate and transferring to the mason ary of the\narchway, from where we dropped\ndown to the narrow sill outside\nthe 'Guard Box'. Moving\ncautious ly to our right we\nstepped across to the Varitype\nLedge.\n\"The next stage was a careful shuffle along the Printing\nRoom sill to the difficult Rose\nWindow, which has proved a thorn in the side of previous\nattempts. However, high spirits\nwithin the team carried us\neasily across to the smallest\nledge of the traverse, after\nwhich comes the previously\n'Impossible Corner'.\n\"This was turned after a few close shaves when members\nof the ' expedition lost their\nfooting. Using a hitherto untried\ntechnique, our leader finally\ngained the'relative safety of the\nof the next eastward ledge.\n\"The team followed his\nexample and the final stage\npast the Botany Entrance proved\na mere formality.\"\nOur staff expert on climbing\nmatters, Ms Virginia Creeper,\nhas raised grave doubts as to\nthe new method used to crack\nthe \" Impossible Corner\". She\nsuspects illicit use of a bar\nstool.\nRumours have been circulating college during the past\nweek that, following a visit by the Watney's representative,\na different brewery will be supplying the Union Bar in the\nNew Year. At present it has not been possible to track down\neither confirmation or a firm denial but certainly there has\nbeen a strong reaction from some members of the Union\nclosely involved with bar activities.\nStop Press\nSAMBotage\nRecently, in a stunningly\nswift attack, our Political correspond ant was seriously\nwounded in a most sensitive\narea. After recent exposure in\nthe popular press, the king of the\nLSO had suffered continual\nh arras s ment and had decided to\nfade from the public eye.\nHowever this terrorist action is bound to produce-some countermeasures from his close associates while he is\nincapacitated.\nSecurity Forces do have one\nlead in this very strange affair\nand have issued the following\nwarning. Avoid all suspicious persons wearing blonde wigs\nand showing a good set of\nteeth. When confronted you are\nadvised to remain seated and\nnot be confused by the pidgin.\nStunned reactions\nAny move to change to a different brewery would come as no surprise to those people\nconversant with recent failures\non the part of the present\nsuppliers. During the past few\nweeks the draught lemonade tap\nhas been removed after Schweppes proved inefficient in\nsupplying sufficient stocks to keep pace with sales. They are not alone in failing to\nmeet promised delivery dates,\nScottish and Newcastle Breweries have also consistently failed\nto produce the goods on time.\nHaving heard the rumour that\nWatney-Mann were being called upon to supply us, our correspondent went out to gauge\nreaction. No one would confirm\nor deny the rumours but many\nwell known regulars were quite\nvocal about the matter. Paul Ku row ski, Chris Morrell and\nAdrian Sudworth could manage\nlittle more than a stunned,\n\"What!\", whilst Steve Dearing\nof City and Guilds was somewhat\nmore forthcoming: \"It's****** what!\" Nick Brayshaw was not available to comment but\nMr John White seemed unconcerned, pausing only to comment\nthat \"It doesn't make any\ndifference to me\". The official(?)\nICU line appears to come from\nDerrick Everett (Bar Committee\nChairman), who would only say that the choice of beers \"is up\nto Brendan (Bar Manager)\" and\nhe thought the changes were\n\"a malicious rumour\".\nGuinness unaffected\nFurther investigations, including staff interviews, served\nonly to clarify the rumours. It\nwould appear the Watney's are\nbeing asked to supply real ale( going under the trade name of\n\" Fine dAle\"), but that supplies\nof present extras, such as cider\nand Guinness (draught and\no ott led), should remain un affected.\nThe bar manager, Mr Brendan\nClements, a confirmed Guinness drinker, appeared unperturbed by\nthe whole affair. \"Til work for\nany one who pays me\" he said in answer to our reporter's questions. Perhaps Mr Clements\nis unaware of the detrimental\neffect on trade that this change\ncould have. Many people have\nexpressed support for the idea\nof a boycott of the bar if these\nmeasures come into force and\n'Squaddie' Patterson, Hon Sec of R SMU, was certainly not\nalone when he said,\"/'// go\nand drink elsewhere.\"\nNothing but harm So it would seem that the\ngeneral consensus of opinion\namongst students is that the\nproposed change to Watneys will do nothing but harm to the\nconviviality of the Union Bar. \"No beer is better than\nWatneys!\" could well be a battle cry heard in the near\nfuture. Perhaps college ought\nto rethink the whole matter in view of the fact that the Union\nBar supports the refectories to\na great extent and an organised\nboycott of the bar could have\nserious consequences to the\nfinancial stability of this side\nof college affairs.\nr inside-c tn-et i( fa tp at/ oo-n.

    "content": "NUS conference report by Paul Ekpenyong\nENDSLEIGH SOLD\n'The doom merchants were wrong, we'll be here in 1977',\nstated Chris Morgan, NUS Treasurer in summing-up on the NUS Services debate. Mr Morgan, who suffered two motions of censure,\nwas able to make this claim following the' passage of an amendment to the main resolution calling for the sale of End sleigh Insurance (Brokers) Ltd. End sleigh Insurance was a depreciating burden which, as with the service companies that\nhad folded, was severely under\ncapitalised, the conference was\ntold. An injection of capital\ninto End sleigh of the eider of\n\u00a3300,000 was required if the\ninsurance service for students\nand the jobs of End sleigh staff\nwere to be safeguarded.'\nInvestigating Committee\nThe main resolution incorporating an amendment calling for a committee to investigate\nthe collapse of the travel and printing companies was passed with only a handful of votes\nagainst. The election of members\nof this committee took place on the last morning of the conference and the results are to be\ncirculated to constituent\norganisations of NUS at a later\ndate. Eight candidates stood for\nthe five vacancies on the\ncommittee and of these Andrew\nPott and S Baylis are almost\ncertain to be elected. LST.Bs\nThe final resolution passed also instructs the NUS Exec. 'to assist in the setting up of\nviable local student travel\nbure ux( LSTBs)' by local student unions and local student area organisations.\nNationalise\nTwo major amendments to\nthe main resolution, the first\nsponsored by Trotskyist s groups\nand the second by the Federation,\nof Conservative Students ( FCS) were heavily defeated Both\ncalled for the no confide nc ing of all the present NUS Executive members of the Services Board. The Trotskyists amendment\nalso called for the national is ation of the service companies.\nSpeaking against the amen-d ment, a delegate from Bolton\nCollege of Education described\nit as 'utopian rhetoric' and condemned nationalisation as 'anti-services which cater for\nthe diverse interests of all\nstudents'.\nPrior to the debate of the\nmotion on NUS Services, the\nconference had considered and\nrejected an emergency report on\nNUS Services. The Executive was severely criticised and\nangry delegates demanded to\nknow why no information had\nbeen given to the membership\nduring the critical period before\nit was decided to liq ui date NUS Travel, Uniprint and Photomec.\nCensure\nReplying, Charles Clarke admitted that members (of NUS*)\nfelt they were kept in ignorance\nof events but it was very\ndifficult to get across complex\nfinancial information to the\nmembership. It had been\nnecessary to liquidate the\nailing companies without\nnotifying the membership because as soon as it is realised that a company could\nno longer trade it had to cease trading immediately, he said. Although, diss at if i ed delegates failed to carry a motion\nof no confidence, in Mr Clarke, Chris Morgan, Dave Aaronovitch\n( VP Services) dnd Ms Penny\nCooper ( VP Education) - the\nexecutive members on the NUS Services Board \u2014 they did pass\na motion of censure on all four\nby a substantial majority.\nPARKER'S PRIORITISATION\nMOVES FAIL\nA move by the Federation of\n'Conservative Students to have\nelements of the grants campaign\nprior it is ed failed by a majority\nof 2 to 1 on a card vote. The move was supported unanimously\nby the IC delegation.\nThe move-embodied in an amendment to the main resolution \u2014 was attacked as divisive and seeking to hide acceptance\nof cuts in public expenditure,by\nSue Slipman, NUS National\nSecretary.\nSpeaking in favour of the\namendment, Gary Grant (Birm-ingham University) claimed that\nthere was\" no coherent\npolitical argument against\nprior it is at ion\".As an example\nof .the ineffectiveness of the\npresent broadly based campaign,\ninter collating students were in\ndire need and if the NUS did not pull its finger out there\nwould be no inter collating students, he claimed. Rick Parker, IC Union PG Affairs Officer, summing up, accused the NUS Executive of\n'absolute compromised paranoia'.\nThe broad front campaign he\nsaid, \"is getting bloody thin\".\nA Trotskyist amendment\nadvocating 'super militancy' was\nthrown out. The final resolution\nadopted continues previous\npolicy on grants and cuts and endorses the NUS claim for a35% increase in the main rate\nof grant for 1977/78. The claim is \u00a3915 for students staying at\nhome, \u00a31,185 as the main rate\nand \u00a31,290 for students in London. The corresponding\nclaims for postgraduates are \u00a31,525, \u00a31,975 and \u00a32,150.\nINDIA SOCIETY DISCO\nLower Refectory\nFriday17 th DEC7.30 pm 'Adm. 15p Continued from front page.\nCrisis avoided\n'Unco-opera ii ve However, it became apparent\nat the meeting that the major\ncause of the crisis was the\nresignation of staff due to\ndisagreements with editorial\npolicy. Mr Dewey had been 'uncooperative with staff\non occasions to an extent considered far exceeding the\nbounds of his office as editor.\nMr Suss had attempted to\nreason with Mr Dewey several\ntimes and feeling he was getting no-where, drew up the\npetition as a last resort. Mr\nEkpenyong claimed that\n'discontent went as far as\nthe administration in College\nBlock'.\nDavid Fox all( Phoenix editor)\nan independent observer at the\nmeeting blamed both sides. 'There has been a lot of misunderstanding and bad faith'\nhe said, 'Both sides have\nbecome very polarised over the\nmatter.'\nNick Brayshaw ( ICU Pre sident/ who just arrived at this\npoint, thought the measures\ntaken by Mr Suss were 'a bit\nextreme'. He suggested ii at rather than dragging up history,\nthe persons involved in the\ndispute get together to formulate\na list of points concerning\ndefinite grievances to be\nbrought to aUG M. He proposed\nthat a censure motion would\nbe more in order after both\nsides have attempted to settle\ntheir differences.\nJohn White ( ICU Sec) pointed\nout that there will be aUG M in the first week of term to\ndiscuss travel and the FELIX Question could be raised at that meeting. As he had not\nyet received the petition, he\nhad not enough time to call aUG M for the next day.\nMr Suss then said that he would be prepared to move\ncensure rather than no-confid,ence if Mr Dewey would only\nconsent to a change in attitude.\nThis was agreed to, and an adj our ment was called for\nwhile the parties discussed in\nprivate the nature of the motion\nto the U GM. The motion will take die\nfollowing form:-1. An agreement on what went\nwrong in FELIX.2. Discussion of position of\nFELIX within the Union.\n3. A call for an independant\nFinancial Controller without\nwhose consent no money can be spent.\n4. A request that all parties\nshow a change of attitude and\nhave more good will.5. To move a motion of censure\non Mr Dewey.\nIt was also agreed that the i Executive be mandated to\nappoint an interim Financial Controller.\nThe Editor wishes it to be\nknown that Mr Crabbe has been\ngiven a completely free hand to\nwrite this story.\nAt an emergency meeting of the ICU Publications Board, held\non Monday evening the circumstances leading to the recent petition\nfor an EG M were considered. After some considerable discussion it was agreed by all parties that the proposed motion of. no\nconfidence in Mr Dewey was not justified but that there was a real\nproblem within FELIX. The meeting agreed that the financial\nposition was serious and that a financial controller should be appointed by the Union Executive immediately. No money is to be\nspent without the consent of the controller. All parties agreed to a substantial shift in attitude and to p nt the paper first before\npersonal disagreements. A motion on these points is to be presented at the next U GM along with a motion of censure on Mr\nDewey for allowing the situation to develop.\nAny party who has any views on the future of FELIX and its role in ICU should contact the Pub. Board Working Party, via myself in the Union Office, who are currently considering FELIX. The next meeting is at the beginning of next term.\nJOHN ALLEN, Chairman,\nICU Publications Board.\nGovt's Benefit Turnround\nStudents are likely to\ncontinue to be able to draw\nsupplementary benefit in the\nShort Vac s: commenting on the\ncase put by Mrs Audrey Wise, MP, on the students' behalf,\nMinister Orme \u2022 of the DHS S called it 'devastating', and\npromised to review the principle\nas well as the anomalies of the\nSocial Security (Miscellaneous\nProvisions) Bill as it affects\nstudent claims on the DHS S. Mrs Wise, left wing Labour\nMP for Coventry, South-West,\nbased her argument on the\nSupplementary Benefits Commission report of last month\nwhich revealed the extent of\ndads' default in grant payment.\nThe NUS met with education\nminister Gordon .Oakes on\nTuesday to discuss the clauses within the Bill which will\naffect students. According, to\nSue Slipman, NUS National\nSecretary, they were told that\nthe Government are now prepared\nto reconsider the clause stating\nthat all full-time students shall not be entitled to claim supplementary benefit during the short\nvacations.\nEven if the Bill does become\nlaw, it does not come into\naffect until Christmas 1 9 7 7 .\nWANT TO GO TO FRANCE/\nGERMANY?\nLift offered in comfortable\ncar on 23rd DECEMBER1976 CThurs) on the following route:\nCalais \u2014 Lille \u2014 Namur \u2014\nCologne \u2014 Frankfurt \u2014 Munich.\nCosts to be shared.

Somewhere in this FELIX, hopefully\nbelow this article, you will find a list of\nColleges and Universities with whom< IC\nUnion has a Reciprocal Membership\nAgreement. This agreement is such that\nwe can use their facilities and vice versa whenever either be in the locality,\nif you see what I mean.\nAnyway, what it boils down to is that\nif you look through the list and discover the Wolfgang J. Flywheel College of\nPhysical Education for young ladies which just happens to back onto your\ncountry retreat \u2014 the rf you can use this\nagreement and go and have as will in\ntheir bar or join their Hatha Rugby Club. All you have to do is say \" You' re Chalky White of the Daily Mirror and I claim my \u00a3 5 \" , no, ho, no I mean \" I'm a Reciprocal Member of your Union and I would like to use your facilities\".

    "content": "Dear\nI am writing to you both as a constituent and as a student, presently studying for a degree at Imperial College. I would like to bring to your attention the situation faced by\nmany students in view of the low main rate of grant and by the\ninjustices of the present parental contribution system.\nThe main rate of grant in London is at present \u00a3955 for Under-graduates and \u00a31380 for Postgraduates. This amount is equivalent to about \u00a328 per week in term time and is supposed to cover all expenses in one of the most expensive areas of the country Central London.\nThe situation for students who do not receive the full parental contribution to make up their grant to the notional level is even worse. Many have to run up large overdrafts during their time of study and hope to pay them off when they get a job at\nthe end of their education. The number of students who do not receive a full grant for this reason has been estimated by the Department of Education and\nScience at73% of all students. This figure is based on a recent survey of students at institut i a as of Higher Education throughout\nBritain. I would like to ask you as my representative at Westminster to press the Goverment, at this time of the triennial review of\ngrants, to take ? ome action which will ease the financial burdens which are imposed on students by the present grant system.\nYours sincerely, "
