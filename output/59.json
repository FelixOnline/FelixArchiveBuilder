    "content": "FELIX.4 PROFILE TONY GILL\nTony, the President of the City and Guilds Union, o amet oI.C. in1951 at the tender age of21, and is at present completing the third year of the Mechanical Engineering course. before coming to I.e., Tony spent ten years at a private school, where, as he says, he s at and passed no examinations. He then became apprenticed to a firm of boiler and diesel engine manufacturers at the age\nof 15. During the next six years he took hi aM at ric. and Inter. B. Sc. by correspondence, night school and private study. In his first year a tI.C. Tony joined the Boat club to row but decided the following year that co xing was more in his line. His Presidential duties forced him to abandon rowing after Mor p ny Day; he now exerts himself with the occasional game of squash and other rackets. Tony was married last summer and appears as President of Guilds by kind permission of Mrs. Gill. He seems to thrive on his double life as\nhusband and President. As President Tony haB proved an excellent leader, and his round common\nsense and appraisal of situations have proved very valuable in Union affairs in general. Tony' s friendly good humour enlivens many a meeting, though some of his Al Read like imitations and his delight in spinning coins in any\navailable hollow vessel prove infuriating to some.\nHis birthday, April1 st, may throw some light on\nthis. Tony' s musical and literary tastes are catholic though generally middlebrow. He likes food, drink, most of the vices in moderation and wearing the Guilds President's coat. He dislikes pompous it y, untidiness and wearing a wet Guilds Presidential coat. BUSTER'S COLUMN The Rug ger Club held a hop last Saturday, and with the help of Brian Spooner and his band turned it into one of the more successful of this year' shops. The prizes were\ngood, the rumbas were terrific and on the whole an evening of good clean fun was had by all. It was most invigorating to see two hefty rug ger types laying into each other during one of the elimination dances. \"Oh Jolly Rug ger Shirts\".'.******** An attempt to start up Speedway Racing in the Guilds' entrance hall was foiled when the irate owner arrived to claim his\" Bantam\".******** N.B. Burt ol Cleaners of210 High Street, Ken sig ton, are willing to allow a10)2 discount to students of I.C. for the cleaning of personal attire. It will be necessary for students to produce their Union cards in order to obtain this discount.******** \"THAMES\", The U.L. poetry anthology, is now out. It can be had from the Editor of Phoenix, price, l/Sd. Half the contributions are from Kings, there are none\nfrom I.C. Most of the poems are conventional in style, there being only a couple that may be called modem and\none pseudo poetic.******** There are Scottish Nationalists in the Guilds. That fact came to light at the Engineering Society Symposium\non HydroElectric schemes. A member of staff, in making\nreference to a Scottish HydroElectric scheme happened\nto mention something about rabid Scottish Nationalists'5 whereupon a Scottish member of the audience shouted \"Shame\", indicating that he did not think a mere S assen ach should call a Scottish Nationalist rabid. When later the speaker was questioned about the consequences of flooding in such a scheme, he indicated that he thought it would be a good tid ng if a few Scottish Nationalists were\ndrowned in the process. This was too s much for the Scottish element in the audience, and he got up and\nhotly denounced the lack of interest shown by the English in Scottish Home affairs.******** ENGINEERING SOCIETY DINNER Dr. Will is Jackson is this year's president of the City and Guilds Engineering Society. In his presidential address, on Thursday11 Feb.\nhe spoke on \"The Increasing Engineering Import ance of some Rare metal a\" but in his preface he\ncommented on certain of his impressions on reentering industry. \u2022\n\"\n. These included the very real threat of German competition and the very many openings available to the graduate in industry. He emphasized the opportunities in the production engineering field which graduates usually neglect in preference to research, des ign and development. During his address, Dr. Will is Jackson discussed transistors as competitors to thermionic valves, followed by some thoughts on the economics of power reactors and concluded with a brief mention of the use of titanium in aircraft structures. The address was followed by the annual dinner in the Ayrton Hall. Dr. W.H. Gl an ville,in proposing the toast to the Society, opened by\nsaying that the present English students were not so \" scruffy\" as in his day. He remarked on the membership of the S meat cn ian Society which by its constitution, consisted of48 engineers and 12 gentlemen. A feature of this society, which endeared it to many of those present, was\nthe toast\" success to waterworks, public or private... contribute to comfort... and\nhappiness of mankind\". Paul Cross( Student Chairman of the Society) in his reply gave an account of the societies activities. This session there has been an\nincrease of30$ in attendance at meetings. He\nwas of the opinion that this could be mu oh better if brown bag gers and those who undertook\" other nocturnal activities\" came along. Neville Wilson( Sec. of the So oie ty) proposed the toast to the guests which was replied by A. Alb u i(M.P. for Edmonton). He complained of his taxi driver not knowing of City and Guilds When pressed for an explanation, the driver state, that he was usually on night duty but Mr.. Alb ui said that that would have been no exo use in his day. In conclusion, he was glad to see the present improvement from the lew prestige which science and engineering degrees used to give. Afterwards the Guilds president led the singing, first in the Ayrton Hall but later removed to the lawn in front of the Imperial Institute due to coercion from Queen le with her hand resting on a bottle1 NO.B.B, SOCIAL LI FE IN I.C. isn't WHAT IT USED TO BE,\nBUSTER'S COLUMN(. con td.)

    "content": "FELIX ICE YACHTING ON THE WELSH When the Harp froze over to a depth of several inches, sailing appeared to be\nimpossible. However a few hardened members\nof the sailing club sie zed the opportunity of realising a lifelong ambition to build a nice yacht. No plans or photographs were available but after long and careful consideration the or aft was finally built in2 f hours. It proved almost a complete failure: the helmsman being powerless to control its gyrations. By the time siu table modifications had been made the wind dropped and\nhigh speeds were not possible although control was improved. It was found possible to travel at almost twice the speed of the wind. Just as the thaw was setting in, a North Wist e rly squall made it possible to sail up\nand down the Harp and one length was comp let ed in2 minutes at an average speed of just under30 m.p.h. A challenge was sent to Oxford University Y. C. for them to bring their ice yacht down for a match. They had to refuse because they had not discovered a means of steering it\" in a predetermined manner\".\nI.C. W.S.C. The Women's Boat Club is now officially apart of I.C. W.S.C. They are in touch with the U.L. Boat house about obtaining ac como dati on and equipment, and hope by next term to have a crew worthy of I.C. They are certainly willing to work; hard, and we wish them\nthe best of luck. In the U.L. netball rally held at Furze down Training College on Feb. 1 3 th, a rather depleted I.C. team, playing together for the first time this term, started well by beating West fl el d College. Their other three opponents, Royal Holloway College, Royal Free Hospital Medical School and Goldsmith's pr uvea too much for them However, out it was\nfelt on the whole that the I.C. team did not disgrace them.\nJ.I. Find later( President) RUG GER Last Saturday the first team beat London Transport by the handsome margin of30 points to nil. Given a good supply of the ball, particularly from loose scrum s, the backs combined well and allowed the wings to show their paces. Spooner scored four times and Palmer one, al ls\nfrom Holman passes. Hy kin also scored one try. Lewis and He a rnk ioke dwell, sharing two\npenalty goals and three conversions. The second XV were overwhelmed by a fit team\nfrom St. John's College, Cambridge, by 36-0,\nafter holding their opponents to50 at halftime. The 'A' XV, for whom Doncaster played well at standoff half, beat Napier80 and the Extra' A' lost90 to Staines. In the evening the Club rana successful\" Hop at the Union. All members of the Club showed great willingness to help in the work which this entailed before, during and after the event. It was rather disappointing that Bell's stalwarts did not have occasion to chuck anyone out, but otherwise a good time was had by all, especially Dan.\nBOXING To the Editor of Felix. Dear Sir,I am writing this letter to appeal for support for the I.C. Boxing Club, whose numbers\nhave now reached the lowest ebb.\nIn the past this college has had very strong\nand good boxing teams, and in the last few years\nit has constantly been winners or runners-up in the U. A.U. Boxing Championships, and many of our\nmembers have boxed for the University.\nI should like to think that students of this college are- not lacking in the courage un doubt ably necessary to box; although from the support\nreceived this seems to be the reason. It is not\nmy wish to force the Boxing Club upon you if you\nii ave no interest whatsoever in it, but I do\nappeal to those who have even a slight inclination for bo-c ing to get in touch vd th ne soon.\nThank you very much,\nFred Carr.Captain Boxing Club.\nNATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY ANNUAL D IN NE;A printer's error made this a unique occasion in the history of I.C. for it was announced that the NATIONAL History Society would hold its Annual Dinner in the Upper Dining Hall on 1 1 th February,1954. The distinguished guest was\nProf. G.E. Blackman who in his lecture on \" Selective Ph y to toxicity\"( weed killers) quickly dispelled any doubt that may have remained as to the biological nature of the gathering. John Levy Proposed the toast of the Society coupled with the name of the President Owen\nJew is s. In the President's reply(15 mins.55 sees.) he thanked all his henchmen ( and TECHNICAL TRENDS \u2014 Wo2. women) and commented on how excellently the aims of the society had been upheld in the past year. John Felton VicePresident of the Society gave the toast to the guests and the dist ingui sf ted guest replied. As st. Prof. Hewer in prop rosing the toast to the ladies remarked on the admirable selection of young lady students by\nthe interviewing Profs. He also urged I. C.W.

FILM REVIEW OIL TOWN US.A A new type of film appeared in London last week at- the Gaumont private theatre inWard our Street, arranged by the Billy Graham\nLondon Crusade. It is an attempt to tell the story of the evangelistic campaign in Houston Texas, and to explain its effect on the lives of a hardheaded oil king Lance Manning, and\nhis daughter Chris. Through the witness of Jim and Kay Tyler, on whose ranch Manning has struck oil, Chris is introduced to spiritual things and is converted. Disaster causes Manning to see that his little kingdom of oil holds nothing but emptiness, and through the Texas City ship explosions he to oia faced with reality. He finds the answer in the closing scenes of the film, in one of Graham's evangelistic meetings. Actual scenes are shown of the crowd of60,000 who attended the meetings, and also of the devastation caused by the Texas City explosions. These have been skilfully incorporated into the film sequence, and on the whole the production is excellent, though in a few other places it lacks continuity. The cast is composed of Christians from all walks of life, including some well known Hollywood personalities. Manning is well played by Paul Power, a Presbyterian minister, whose only fault is that he sometimes does not appear quite angry enough and deadly enough to fit the Manning type. The best performance is given by Colleen Townsend as Chris. a thoroughly natural, unaffected personality easier to play than that of Manning. The film gives an interesting insight into Billy Graham's message and methods. He speaks to the simple but universal needs of the people, presenting Christ as God's answer to s in, sorrow and death the traditional message of Christianity. His presentation is forceful, though not emotional, and shows a refreshing lack of the sensationalism which characterised American evangelism of the1930' s. To sum\" up, Oil town is a movie with a message\nand forms a useful introduction to Graham's coming o a mpa ign. T.W. Slinger land. PHOENIX REVIEW I remember standing in the quad a year ago\nand being told by P.L. Jones that all critics, from Herbert Read down to the Editor of FELIX( myself, at the time) were parasites. This outburst was caused by the appearance of a FELIX containing my impressions of an R.C.S. Carnival. Thus you may imagine my joy on finding that, in the PHOENIX under review, Mr Jones has joined ae\namong the fleas and tapeworms, and has criticised the recent Art exhibition. As he assures us in his article, he sees the world with the\" privileged eye\" of the Artist so he is fully competent for his unpleasant task, and his host, Art, will agree that he has done her a service. English science fiction was born in PHOENIX\n(The Time Machine), so u.C. Kale takes a considerable risk in bringing it up again. However, he\noffers us acute little story set in the usual period( late1960' s, after the3 rd World War), but I felt that n is theme was too large to be developed in a few pages. It will make a good basis for his first science novel. Admirers of the work of\" A.R.3.\" will be surprised that the latest manifestation of his genius( rarely seen nowadays) is serious in nature. It takes the form of an autobiographical fragment, strung very poetically together, the principal effect being produced by excessive use of the word\n\"and\". However, as most readers will skim through it looking for the plot, we need consider it no\nmore.\nMr de Reuck makes his usual brilliant job of the Dramatic Criticism. One point: he mentions the absence of the traditional bouquet from the Mines. This was because there was no traditional \"Mines\nNight\" on that occasion: what occurred was quite unofficial. Mr. Blackmore, admirable in many ways as Editor, made a mistake when, he allowed A. Peacock to be\nthe official PHOENIX historian of Social Activities. It would be a shame if Mr. Peacock's uninformed view of the work of college amateurs in art and music should pass to posterity as a Ken era l opinion. With the A ck land Essay, a i the important Commemoration Day speech of Dr. Logan this edition of PHOENIX is worth the bob they want for it A.rb. "

    "content": "FELIX i' LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nDear Sir, To coin a phrase, rags have been dragged out of the bag, but only to have the traditional type of \"argument for\" ground out. These, rather than justifying the practice, seek to smirch nonparticipant s and this is very unfortunate. For while it will only further alienate objectors it may cause the\" floating voters\" to doubt the courtesy of rag gers. Moreover, to suggest that rags provide mental relaxation must be qualified, for, to use an analogy, the palate does not need rest to maintain it in trim, but variety so that it may be always active. So it is with them5 nd and the rag provides a vehicle for keen intellectual activity, as all who have been privileged to witness arag committee at work villa f firm. The forming of strategy, the whipping up of enthusiasm, the organising of an appearance of randomness in the proceedings demand selfless devotion of the highest order. Spanish students have demonstrated for the return of Gibraltar. Egyptian students have demonstrated for the return of the Canal Zone.\nVarious student groups in Europe have reached the stage of habitually demonstrating for peace. In other fields, workers demonstrate for higher wages. Demonstration is a much used, if not overworked, technique and it has acquired a bad( name. Why? Because it is used to achieve an object, to propagate a policy, and no matter how\npraiseworthy this policy is it is impossible to escape the feeling that it is being promulgated in an unfair, almost nefarious, manner.\nIn an elegantly simple fashion the British student has overcome this difficulty. Here it is possible to have the excitement and der ring dc of a demonstration without the odium of an axe to be ground. The system could have originated only in these islands, for only here is the necessary spirit and imagination found for people to be enthusiastic and demonstrative about nothing. This is the rag, which, though developed in the universities, has permeated to all walks of life in its appeal, so that the ordinary man refers affectionately to a periodical which successfully deals excitedly with very little as a \"Rag\". The connection is clear. Such is the.\nsuccess of the rag that it is unlikely that it will be superseded, though reports of super rags from across the Atlantic and of Red rags from Moscow may cause uneasiness in this respect. Antiquarians may rest assured th st Britain will continue with her traditional. form.\nC. Rank.\nBear Six, If sex that your correspond antin his' sobering\nthought' of the last issue of FELIX, somewhat missed tha\nheat. He suggests that all work be made oo a pula ary in Universities, which would mean that the academic side of\ntho ivers rt j life would have ta be run on similar lines to a school. The 'weak winded' , far whom the scheme is suggested,\nwould be bullied into doing tha work, would become more\nharassed whan faced with sere than they feel capable of, and\nwhan call ad upon \"to maintain a position as a self-supporting\nci liz an\" will suffer greater shock in having to fend for himself. Surely the main causes of depression at Universities are those for which cure is by no means ao simple; viz. that\nthe student is almost certain to be in a state of nervous\ntension (p rasu ahn g he has some desire to glean benefit from\nhas course) just before an exam; that he is doing nothing\nconstructive that shows tangible result still the results of the exams axe through; and that he baa plenty of time on his hands if he is of the reserved and brown-bagging type. If be\nis given to J worrying, all these factors help him to do so,\nand it may ao happen that he becomes so wrapped in morbid\no on aide rations of himself that he finds the weight of his cares unbearable and is tempted to commit suicide. Short of psycho-analysing every student to pick out potential worry ers, the present trend to lay on more part-time activities and to use stronger persuasions to get Freshers to take part seems\nta be the best policy to pursue. The real cure seems to rest\noutside University control in the hands of the parents and\nelse friends of the student in question.\nRobert Fillmore.\nDeer Sir, May I express my sincere hope that Council's plans for the Union extensions, shortly to be published in FELIX, provide SOUNDPROOF\nac como dati on for the Bridge Club. Rarely neve I entered the old lounge\nwithout hearing unceasing running commentaries\nor post-mortem s on bridge gamer. Does it occur to the offenders that not everybody is interested in bridge? Yours faithfully, NOB - pi.a 'jer.\nw.u. s. The World University Service,( the new name\nof International Student Service formed in1920) is a fellowship of over thirty national committees coordinated by an international secretariat in Geneva. It is in a sense a very loose body, for it has no specific members and no subscriptions. And yet, voluntary contributions and funds raised and spent since its inception several million pounds to assist students and leo tur ers throughout the world. Its operations range over36 countries including G.B., all outside theIr on Curtain Yugoslavia is one. The work done is of many\nkinds. Abroad, it has helped to establish student sanatoria and hostels, provided drugs, food and clothing to student a in need, and provided textbooks, stationery, lab. equipment etc. Assistance to refugee student a in the form of shelter, food, advice in restarting studies etc. also comes under its services provided abroad. In Britain, it has given and is giving financial aid to many students who meet sodden financial difficulties or illnesses. Advice is also given regarding scholarships, grants, visas for study purposes and soon. It team\ntried to develop the interest of British studs art a in University life abroad, and tries to satisfy the curious in this respect. In some in stan oe a*va o ation scholarships or travel bursa ries can be>\nawarded from s pe oi al earmarked funds. W.U. S. also organise soon fe reno ea designed to bring together members of different section soft a a University community together for discussion at*\nmatters of general interest. w.U. S. does not aim to compete vita st wd a a at and teacher organisations of are present at iv* oha rao ter. It is simply an association concerned with serving the University oo sanaa it j student a and leo tur ers throughout the wor la.( Ab stra ot from W.U. S. Tear Book,1953). W.U. S. will oom eup ford is ou as i ono a far* the Union meeting on Tuesday. N.U.S. Some members of I.C. have o on fused W.U. S. with N.U.S. whereas others, although realising the difference, have thought that I.C. belongs to N.U.S. To clarify this matter FELIX presents the following review of N.U.S. in relation to I.C. The National Union of Students was formed in1922 with the objects of1) representing students of this country, both nationally and internationally, and to maintain their cooperation with students of other countries2) promoting educational and social interests of students in entire independence of all political and religious pro pog and a. I.C. were affiliated in December of1922 but d is affiliated in November of1926, after N.U.S. aad asked the Union to increase the affiliation fee from \u00a330 to \u00a360. The I.C. subcommittee looking Into the matter considered that N.U.S. rendered no service to I.C. The Union re affiliated in the year prior to the war but by1939 differences had again occured. A motion by the I.C. General Committee deplored the political tone of the II.U.S.\" Student News\"\nand I.C. refused to take part in aN.U.S. delegation to the primeminister about the deferment of students. Consequently, I.C.d is affiliated in1940. During this time, the constituent college unions had the right to participate in N.U.S. The only one to do so was R.C.S. which eventually left after finding that the major part of their union meetings was spent in electing delegates to various committees of N.U.S. for the purpose of discussing fatuous motion s.I.C. did have indirect representation on N.U.S. due to its affiliation with the University of London Union. This dual representation ceased sometime later. In1948, re affiliation was proposed. This was defeated on the grounds that N.U.S. did nothing but throw abuse and threats at its own country and that its political leanings were undesirable. At present the main advantages claimed by N.U.S. are its vacation work services and its cheap foreign travel arrangements. The former is of no consequence a tI.C. where an excellent vac. work so heme exists: anyone desiring to take advantage of the latter can do\ndual member.\nso by jain in gN.U.S. as an in divi UN iFR/ ERS\nDAY TY ARTS BALL26 th.

    "content": "3\nEVERY\nFORTNIGHT\nNO. 59 IMPERIAL COLLEGE19 FEBRUARY1954 OH,( SIR) JASPER! Last Friday Guilds were to have held a Union Meeting to dispose of2 old cars which had taken up permanent residence in the yard behind Guilds. These derelict vehicles had been forsaken by their owners, due to the probable fin canci al loss resulting from their removal. Guilds Union Committee proposed to sell these valuable scrap heaps by auction at1.15 p.m., with resulting good quiet fun for all. Now the R.C.S. Union had also planned some\ngood fun in secret for the same occasion. When a Guilds Union meeting is held it is the habit of the President to bring the Spanner to the meeting. On this occasion the VicePresident, brave Jasper Aspinall, was to bring it instead. At1.13 p.m. he had obtained the spanner and was carrying it across the Guild sEnt rano e Hall. Then the R.C.S. struck I Certain of their number, who accept the hospitality of Guilds Lecture Courses, and were\nthus unsuspected, pounced on valiant Jasper and persuaded him and the Spanner to ao company them\noutside.\nThe Spanner was there taken over by a cyclist6 ft. 8 4 ins.tall, who strangely was another R.C.S. man. This was the first time that the trophy had left Guilds' possession for seventeen years, and naturally they were annoyed. The giant cyclist was apprehended( minus Spanner), de bagged outside the R.C.S. Main Building, and then folded in two so that he could fit into the boot of a car. The car plus Guilds then proceeded to I.C. Union, where the President of R.C.S. was found unattended and pressed to join the party. Then with two hostages a parley was held in front of the R.C.S., whose doors were barricaded. The bargain of two animate objects, One President and one de bagged, in exchange for one inanimate object, the Spanner, was refused with jeers by the R.C.S. from the shelter of their building. No other course was left but for the Meeting to adjourn to the Serpentine, so that some\nform of aquatic entertainment oo ul d take place. The de bagged one realising that he was\nhopelessly outnumbered consented with good\ngrace to break the ice, and sank to 'pant level',4 ft. for him. Our reports become at rifle confused at this point, but we know for certain that the President of R.C.S. and the President of Guilds( wearing the Guilds coat) joined the bathing party in the Serpentine. THE DASTARDLY DEED\nAfterwards these two gentlemen, honour satisfied, returned in the oar for so ms dry clothes. The de bagged one, whose legs now seemed\nlonger than ever, was made to lead the general procession bao k to College, which he took in continued good psr t.A Black Maria greeted the return down\nExhibition Road with amazement; and probably as a result of natural curiosity four large police men followed the procession towards the Guilds' Entrance. The Guilds men by no* regarded the de bagged one with affection as being a prized relic, so he was rushed into the Mines to save the Police from em baras s ment. Two further byproducts resulted during the afternoon, a very unpleasant smell permeated the upper floors of Guilds and those Guilds men who\nwork in the R.C.S.(1 st Chem. Eng.) endured a passage of arms in the R.C.S. Entrance Hall before they could continue work.\nAs a result of this the R.C. S.table is now\nminus a few legs, and the Guilds men went to tea in pairs....

Circulation: II50 The events on Friday last were a pleasant\nchange from the hum-drum course that this term had\npreviously followed. And these events were especially\nwelcome because they were entirely concerned with\nourselves and gave no trouble (or almost no trouble)\nto the Public. This, indeed, was a change from our\nrags of late. After all this commendation of the 'pinching\nof the Spanner' , it is with regret that we must\ndeplore the way certain people behaved in the\nproceedings. There were the Guildsmenin the entrance\nof Guilds who didn't lift a finger to prevent the\nremoval of their vice-president and the Spanner. What\nspineless creatures must be entering I.C. if there\nare those around us who can muster no spark of\npartisanship for their college.\nA similar reticence to defend the honour of their college was shown by the members of E.C. S around\nthe Union - we know that quite a few were in the main\nE.C. S. building but there were still a goodly number\nin the vicinity of the Union office who offered no\nresistance, whatsoever, to the kidnapping of their President. 3ven when the Guildsmens' victims were\ntaken round to E.C. S., the hordes inside still made no\neffort to effect the release of Jim Anderson. It is to his credit that he told his colleagues that he would\nrather go for a swim than for them to surrender the\nspanner. But by this time the spanner must have been\nwell and truly hidden ( for the organisation so efficient in acquiring the Spanner would surely have arranged for a suitable deposit ary) and there would have been no\ndanger of losing it if they had come out and given\nbattle for their President.\nLet us have more rags of this kino, nut in future affairs we hope to see a greater show of loyalty to our respective unions.\n\" PERSONAL\" ADVERTISEMENTS FOR SALE: One centre shafted putter made by Lumley s.

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CLUB 'Wednesday evening last week saw a great number of people gat ne red trying to get a seat in the Gym for an evening w nio h promised some-thing different. It was the first venture of the newly formed International Relations Club? and they had decided to present an evening of music and dancing from India. All apprehensions regarding the number of people turning up turned to joy when they saw the Gym overflowing with people. It would have been a pity had the oas t of40 been greeted by an audience of the sane size. The evening itself provided unusual variety. Colourful dances alternated with savage singing almost shouting of folksongs, strange instruments making stranger but unmistakably musical sounds, and, once, a ratner lengthy film about the Indian dances. This perhaps was t ne only item which might be termed boring; for while the majority did not appreciate what was going on,\nthey certainly found the other items interesting. An exhibition of Indian drawings, handicrafts and photographs in the Upper Dining Hall provided the curious with much to discuss, as did the dresses of the many Indian girls who turned up\neither as artists or as audience or bot n. The Club hopes to organise similar functions in the future. It you hear tom-toms in the Union one evening) or see a boomerang going round, you' ll know what is up. VIEWPOINT There are good books in the Union library. Some of them are rather large or their nature may\nbe such as to make them more conveniently read in the library. And since it is more enjoyable to read and s it, the library is equipped vy it h com-for table chairs. The trouble is that the o hairs are always occupied: the chairs are there to be\nused but surely not by people furiously pushing slide rules or plotting graphs. There are plenty of rooms in I.C. set aside for working. If these are not available, it would be thought that Guilds library, provided with tables, would be preferred to the Union library where' to s it in arm chairs necessitates having one's papers on the\nfloor. In a place like I.C., there is not much\nopportunity for escaping from our studies with their threat of exams to come. The Union library would seem to offer such an escape and to browse through books in the restful and quiet atmosphere, usually typical of libraries, would give a welcome respite from the buffering s of the wisdom of our lecturers on the mind. But we in I.O/, cannot escape'. The restful silence has given way to the squeak and rattle of the slide rule and the scratching s of the scribe. The pleasant atmosphere hs s been replaced by one\ncharged with hostility from, the resentful gaze of the workers on the intruders \"who only want to look at books\". The enjoyment of searching through books has made way for an uneasy flicking of pages, conscious of being watched by eyes looking out from minds that know no peace but that of a finished laboratory report. The introduction of a Union rule banning the pursuit of academic studies, in the Union library is to be deplored. There are more than enough regulations in I.C. where one would think that the benefits of our university education would enable people to appreciate the codes of good\nconduct and act accordingly. Is it not too much to expect the workers in the library to appreciate the intended function of the Union library and that they may find a i more suitable arena for their combat with the ever increasing amount of work to be done? Perhaps they do not know where the Guilds library ends and\nthe Union library begins. A notice at the frontier between technology and fi o tion would make it clear. After all, the use of violence detracts considerably from the chances of attaining the restful and quiet atmosphere, typical of a library. FU SI LIER. R.C.S. UNION MEETING The R.C.S. Union Meeting held on Monday\nFebruary8 th proved to be a much quieter affair than has been the custom of late. No interplanetary rockets were demonstrated! although a bombshell was exploded by Malcolm Campbell, who\nclaimed to be able to explain the fact that Fanny, the shapely Union mascot, had had a baby. He\npointed out that this was no concern of. the Mayor of Maidenhead. The possibility of holding a Formal Dance at Sil wood Par x during May was discussed and approved warmly by the Union, it being felt that eu oha Dance would be a worthwhile experiment and, if successful, an excellent annual feature, as the equivalent of the Engineers Ball or Mines Ball. It might be particularly attractive at a time when\nthe gym. is in its:' alfresco\" condition. An all night dance at a country house wa3 highly favoured by the Union, even when it was realised tn at the moon would be almost full on this proposed date. On a more serious note, the Union was addressed by a representative of the \"florid University Service, who briefly outlined the work of his organisation and appealed for support.. This has been forthcoming from R.C. S.int ne past but has tended to lapse recently. Mr. John Harding endorsed n is remarks, and said that support for W.U. S. was soon to be organised on an I.C. basi?s in cet ne Service was doing admirable work.\nPer ti aps the most interesting topic which arose during t ne Meeting was the state of the college offices( usual).

    "content": "FELIX RAG SUFFICIENT PRICE: ONE HALFPENNY Supplement to FELIX No,59. Friday,19 th February1954 \u00ab\nFELIX gratefully acknowledges receipt of several accounts of last Tuesday's incidents. One or more reports were received from each of the Colleges of I.C. and the following account has been compiled from these. There was a brief meeting of the I I.C.S. Union at Tuesday lunchtime. Afterwards, about200 of R.C. S,,wearing black armbands, assembled outside to follow an' object' painted in C.&G. colours but draped in black, The procession moved off up Exhibition Road and slowly passed Guilds, singing\" We have got the Spanner, It is in our hands.,\" to the tune of' Onward Christian Soldiers'. This was the first that Guilds knew of the proceedings. In a matter of minutes, the Guilds Union Committee had rounded up support and set off after the procession. It had almost reached The Gore when a party of about20 Guilds men attacked the corte ge, During the ensuing brawl, the Guilds men discovered that the' object' was not the Spanner, so took the R.C.S. President in preference to a bolt of square cross section. The R.C.S. abandoned their President, regarding this as a suitable diversion to enable them to reach the bridge over the Serpentine. The gathering were then addressed by' The Rev. Robin Cray1, After aloud' Kong ela', he threw the bolt into the water. Before this occurred, a solitary( and previously unsuspected) Guilds man, in the midst of the R.C.S. made a dive at the bolt but was inevitably overpowered. It seemed as if he might follow the bolt but was saved by the arrival of the main body of Guilds, who had been watching their vanguard de bag the R.C.S. President. Wholesale de bagging then took place. The police arrived on his bicycle and to avoid further trouble, Guilds marched away, leaving a lamppost decorated with a dozen or more pairs of i i.C.S, trousers, During the skirmish, one Guilds man lost his trousers, but seeing a suitable pair on an IRC.3. man, re equipped himself, When Guilds arrived outside their College, it was discovered that Derek Power had gained possession of the bol t.He was greeted, with loud cheers which turned to hisses as the R.C.S. marched by,4 s soon as R.C.S. had gone, the Guilds President dismissed his forces with are sounding' Doom a lack a1. Jim Anderson had now rejoined R.C.S. and led them into Ayrton Hall but wise council prevailed and they left without doing any damage. They returned, to the main R.C.S. buildings and dispersed. Whilst the Guilds men had been busy with R.C.S. downstairs, the Dines had gained access to the roof of Guilds and began to toll the knell of a lost Spanner, On hearing this, Tony Gill and some of his henchmen asic ended to the roof and brought the firehose s to play on the Diners, The water just wouldn't rise high enough to wet them but was sufficient to drive them away from the bells, and the Diners retreated ever the roof to their own building,( At night, the Diners returned to the Guild's belfry. Their equipment was simple, their technique effective,/. hen they loft a little while later, the proud bells of The City and Guilds College were lowered intone, They were painted in the colours of The Royal School of Dines.) With the Dines engaging the attentions of the Guilds President, some Guilds men manually transferred one of the derelict cars from the back of C,&G,t otheR. C.S. doorstep. Their efforts were discouraged by similar unruly elements in the R.C.S. who turned the hose pipes on those outside. The crowd receded but two Guilds men remained behind the door. As soon as the nozzle of the hose reappeared, it was seized from the side and directed inside, By then the proceedings had become out of hand. An eyewitness says:\" The scene was terrible. A number of students were working like maniacs with hose pipes, trying to keep C.& G.out of the building, Hoses were fired through broken windows and the main entrance. Dire extinguishers were being freely used. It was spectacular to see the dust of many years being washed off the highest parts of the walls. Nobody was trying to stop the carnage,\" This witness, on returning to his laboratory, found that hoses had been directed through the open window and it took the rest of the afternoon to cleanup although no apparatus was lost. One of the lecturers in the basement was less fortunate and found his book sandpapers floating about the floor. Three Guilds men who were caught hosing down a professor have been sent down for one week. Later, police( noone knows who called them) visited R.C.S. and took statements from students and academic staff;a newspaper reported tried to get a statement from one of the non academic staff in the basement but was evicted. The police took a very serious view of the afternoon's occurrences and will act more drastically in the event of further disturbances around the college. Professor R,H, Read( the Pro Rector) has informed the Presidents of the College unions that the damage must bo made good from student funds. In future, any students misbehaving in a similar way to this will be liable to severe disciplinary action, not excluding immediate suspension. "
