In here you\u2019ll\nfind a comprehensive report with\npictures and player profiles for the\nJPR Williams Cup. I wish I could\ndo one for every team, but as you\ncan see, this thing is already 16\npages long!\nThanks must go to everyone at\nSport Imperial for making this as\neasy as possible, especially Nick\nGore and Leena Bharadia for their\nhelp with securing an interview\nwith JPR Williams himself.\nI must also thank all the people\nwho actually wrote the match\nreports; if it weren\u2019t for them, we\nwould have just had a pull-out\nwith pictures which, thinking about\nit, would have been a lot easier.\nThanks also to the photographers\nwho got the pics!\nConsider this a little memento of\nthe day and there will be one next\nyear. Hopefully with all the teams\ncontributing to the pull-out.\nEnjoy!\nJov\nJ\nohn Peter Rhys Williams, known\nuniversally as JPR Williams, the\nman after whom the Varsity\nmatch is after, played rugby union\nfor Wales between 1969 and 1981.\nHe was also, apparently, a competent\ntennis player, but gave it up for the\nthen-amateur game of rugby union in\norder to pursue a career in medicine.\nHe quickly attracted attention and was\nconsequently first capped by Wales in\n1969, aged 19. He went on to earn 55\ncaps for Wales and 8 for the British\nLions.\nHe had many high points in his ca-reer, being a key player in a Welsh side\nthat won Grand Slams in 1971, 1976,\nand 1978, but is particularly remembered for his record against England; in\n10 tests between Wales and England he\nscored five tries and was never on the\nlosing side. He was also outstanding\nfor the Lions, winning the 1971 series\nagainst New Zealand with a long-range\ndrop-goal and playing a major role in\nthe 1974 \u2018invincible\u2019 series against\nSouth Africa.\nWhilst pursuing his medical career,\nJPR Williams studied at St. Mary\u2019s,\nnow one of the hospitals in the Imperial College Medical School. It is because\nof his great achievements, both at college and international rugby, that the\nVarsity Match is named after him.\nFelix Sport asked the man himself\na few questions on his thoughts on\nthe match, the day itself and sport in\ngeneral.\n1) How does it feel to have the\nmain rugby event named after\nyou?\nI am honoured to have the varsity\nmatch named after me. It reminds me\nof my medical school days. It\u2019s hard to\nbelieve that it is 40 years since I first\nplayed for St. Mary\u2019s. I still have a\nphoto in my \u201cbar\u201d of Professor Poulter,\nme and the rest of the winning Sevens\nteam \u2026 with hair and sideboards each!\n2) In your opinion, how has the\nwhole Varsity event developed?\nThere is a good healthy rivalry between\nthe medics and the college students\nand it surely must be only a question\nof time before the college gains its first\nwin!\n3) What changes can you see happening in the future?\nI hope the fixture continues to grow\nand that the students show their support in time-honoured fashion.\n4) How does it feel to have your\nname sung with praise every time\nyou come to the event?\nVery nice to be remembered after\nspending all of twelve years at Mary\u2019s.\nDidn\u2019t actually take me all that time to\nqualify: I was also houseman for six\nmonths, anatomy demonstrator for a\nyear, and a senior registrar for 3 years!\n5) How has the spirit of sport\nchanged from your time at\nImperial?\nThe highest compliment is that the\nspirit hasn\u2019t changed, but that the language has deteriorated (especially from\nthe girls!).\n6) Is there enough emphasis on\nsports in college, and schools in\ngeneral?\nProbably not enough emphasis on\nteam sports theses days. My old school\nstill does well; my nephew Huw went\nstraight from Brynteg into the Medics\nside a few years ago. I am doing my best\nto nurture the Imperial/Mary\u2019s team\nethos. Veteran squash doubles pairing\nof Williams/Crofton is still undefeated\nin Cardiff!\nHockey 4\nImperial College wins three out of the four\nhockey fixtures whilst drawing the Mens\n2nds match. The Mens 1sts match finishes\nwith a thrilling round of sudden death after\nthe score stood at 2-2 after normal time.\nFootball 6\nImperial College Mens 1sts thrashes the\nMedicals, putting five past them. The 2nds\nfixture is tighter but IC proves the stronger\nof the two teams.\nBasketball 7\nNetball 10\nImperial Medicals come out on top in every\none of the four Netball fixtures. The 1sts and\n2nds matches go right to the wire but the\nIC 3rds and 4ths struggle to put up quite as\nmuch of a fight\nThe Medicals came out on top in each of the\nNetball fixtures, but the basketball results\nwere an entirely different story. IC thrashes\nthe Medicals almost by 100 points in the\nwomens\u2019 fixture.\nLacrosse 7\nImperial College sends the Medicals flying\ninto the dust, winning 15-3.\nRugby 12\nOnly the women\u2019s report, where they beat\nthe Medicals 15 - 7. The Medicals beat both\nImperial sides, with the 3rd team utterly\ndefeating Imperial 43 - 0\nWater Polo 12\nImperial Medicals drowned out by the\nunstoppable Imperial College team resulting\nin a 10-1 thrashing.\nContents\nJPR Cup 8\nImperial Medicals narrowly win the big one,\nthe JPR Williams Cup, in extra time after\nbeing stunned by an impressive Imperial\nCollege 1sts team.\nPhotos 13\nA selection of photos from the day, including\ngames held at Ethos, Harlington, and\nRichmond.

    "content": "10 felix Friday 14 March 2008\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics\nGenocide and how we should react\nA cutting-edge discussion held by the Political Philosophy Society on Genocide and Genocide Intervention\nClockwise from the top-left\nDr. Nigel Eltringham\nA lecturer in Anthropology,\nDr. Eltringham has studied the\nRwandan genocide intensively.\nHis research was published in\n2004 in the book \u201cAccounting for\nHorror: Post-Genocide Debates\nin Rwanda\u201d. He teaches human\nrights at a post- and undergraduate level and is currently\nconducting research on the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal\nfor Rwanda\nHratche Koundarjian\nMr. Koundarjian is the Coordinator of the \u2018All-Party\nParliamentary Group (APPG) for\nGenocide Prevention. The group\ncounts prominent MPs such as\nthe Rt. Hon. Clare Short MP as\nmembers and has cross-party\nsupport.\nMr. John Gorski\nMr. Gorski has served with Royal\nEngineers and with NGOs in\ncountries affected by genocide.\nHe has first-hand experience in\nthe Balkan region, specifically\nthe Kosovo conflict\nDr. James Smith\nAs co-founder and CEO of\nthe Aegis Trust, Dr. Smith has\nworked with a wide range of\ngovernmental, non-governmen-tal, educational, and academic\ninstitutions around the world.\nAegis Trust is closely linked with\nthe UK Holocaust Centre and\ndoes work in Rwanda, documen-tating the genocide\nIn the 20th century, Raphael Lemkin\ncoined the term \u2018Genocide\u2019. He was a\nPolish-Jewish lawyer writing in 1943.\nHis concept of this \u2018Crime of Barbarity\u2019,\nas he originally put it, originated with\nthe Simele massacres in Iraq in 1933.\nWhen the horrific crimes perpetrated\nagainst the Jews came to be known, the\npost-war world, and specifically the\nnewly-founded U.N., recognized Raphael Lemkin\u2019s \u2018Crime of Barbarity\u2019 for\nthe first time as a crime, separate and\nintrinsically different from murder.\nSince the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of\nGenocide came into existence in 1948,\ngenocide has plagued humanity, in the\nBalkans, South-East Asia, and most\nfamously in Rwanda. Still, in the 21st\ncentury we find ourselves unable to effectively confront the all-too-real genocide in Sudan. On Thursday, March\n6, Imperial\u2019s Political Philosophy Society addressed the issue of genocide,\nand asked its esteemed panelists:\nWhat is genocide?\nWhen does civil war become\ngenocide?\nWho has the right to intervene?\nWhen should one intervene?\nHow should one intervene?\nAs stated earlier, genocide is a crime\naccording to international law \u2013 this\nmuch is true and was not the focus of\nevaluation by the panel. However, Dr.\nSmith did flag certain issues that make\neven the purely legal definition of genocide less clear and helpful than one\nmight believe. To prove that genocide\nis occurring, and therefore take appropriate action, it must be shown that\nthere is a direct intent to destroy a particular ethnic, racial, or religious group.\nWhile this is good to ensure that a differentiation is made between war and\ngenocide, it creates difficulty because\nof the burden of proof it requires. Mr.\nKoundarjian made the comment that\nKadhim Shubber \u201cyou know genocide when you see\nit\u201d but it is not similarly true that you\nknow intent when you see it. In the\ncase of Darfur, it must be proven that\nthe government forces are intending\nto destroy the African tribes in Darfur. This is easy when bullets are used,\nbut, much more difficult, the aggressor\nonly creates the conditions for destruc-tion, such as starvation. Both speakers\nadmitted that there will always be arguments (some valid) against the label\n\u2018genocide\u2019. Indeed, there may be a situation where genocidal acts occur but\nthe situation itself can not be labeled\ngenocide; recent events in Kenya are\nan example of this. It is when a pattern\nof activities, of genocidal acts, become\nobvious that we can begin to use the\nword genocide. A repeating pattern of\ngenocidal activities is enough to prove\nintent, asserted Mr. Koundarjian.\nWhile the question of intent attempts\nto separate war and genocide, in the\ncase of civil war the line is extremely\nblurred and it is difficult for international observers to make a judgement\non the situation. One can begin to differentiate the two by examining the\nroot cause of genocide. Dr. Smith said\nthat genocide does not happen over-night, which should be obvious to all of\nus. It begins with stereotyping and prejudice and follows Gregory Stanton\u2019s 8\nStages of Genocide. Dr. Eltringham\nagreed with Dr. Smith but took a much\nmore human rights-centred viewpoint.\nGenocide, according to him, occurs\nafter a long process of human rights\ndegradation. In fact, human rights act\nas a warning system for genocide and\na signal in a conflict that includes civil\nwar. In complex crises such as civil war,\ncivilians become caught in the cross-fire. If we understand the ideology and\nmotivations driving the civil war, it is\npossible to compare this with the prejudice and human rights degradation\nthat is characteristic of genocide and\nmake a judgment of similarity or dis-similarity. Unfortunately, civil war and\ngenocidal acts have become more and\nmore linked in the modern day, most\nprominently in Yugoslavia and Kosovo.\nIn many cases genocidal acts are used\nas a weapon in civil war.\nThe bulk of interesting discussion, I\n\u201cyou know\ngenocide when\nyou see it\u201d\nThe Panel\nFrom left to right, Dr. Smith, Mr. Koundarjian, Chairman Ammar Waraich, Mr. Gorski, and Dr. Eltringham. The discussion was the last in a week of genocide-related seminars\n\n"

Importantly, the foreign nationals\nto be targeted first are those categories\nbelieved to be most likely to commit\nimmigration offenses, which include\nstudents. Due to the large proportion\nof Imperial students that are not from\nEurope, some of next years freshers\nwill have to carry a government ID\ncard with a college ID card.\nA National Identity Register will be\ncreated, at an estimated cost believed\nto be \u00a35.5 billion. The government\nhave stated that contrary to fears, the\nnew cards will only \u00a330 per person.\nThe government has planned that by\n2012, 90 per cent of foreign nationals\nin the UK will have an ID card.Finger-prints and a digital facial image will be\nheld on the National Identity Register\nand the ID card.

At first\nstudents will be encouraged to voluntarily sign up to the scheme but from\n2011/2012 all UK passport applicants\nwill be signed up to the National Identity Register. British citizens will have\nthe choice to have a passport, ID card\nor both.\nThe private sector will not be able to\naccess your information without your\nconsent, however police, security, intelligence agencies and HM Revenue\nand Customs may access your details\nwithout your consent, including where\nand when you used your card.\nCriticsoftheschemehavequestioned\nthe governments ability to handle sen-Kadhim Shubber\nRector tops UK\nVice-Chancellor\npay chart for 06/07\nsitive information.

We will be able to better protect ourselves and our families against\nidentity fraud, as well as protecting our\ncommunities against crime, illegal immigration and terrorism.\u201d\nThe Editor accepts no responsibility for this horrific stitch-up\nNo-confidence motion called\nagainst CGCU President\nA motion proposed by members of the\nCity and Guilds College Union on the\n19th of February calls for a vote of non-confidence in CGCU President Tristan\nSherliker. The fifteen supporters of\nthe paper (including two CGCU vice-presidents, the Honorary Secretary,\nand two Departmental Representatives) believe that Tristan Sherliker has\nnot lived up to his responsibilities as\nPresident.\nThe motion cites a wide range of duties left unattended, including his failure to submit the CGCU Autumn term\nreport to the Union Council by their\nrequired deadline, despite having had\nten weeks\u2019 notice.\nAmongst other criticisms, the proposed motion accuses Sherliker of \u2018sporadic\u2019 attendance at CGCU Executive\nCouncil meetings and of being difficult\nto contact via phone or e-mail. The\nmotion also quotes the CGCU constitution\u2019s calls for \u201cgeneral meetings [to\nbe convened] in each of the Autumn,\nSpring and Summer terms\u201d and states\nthat \u201cThe Management Committee\nshall meet once every two weeks in\nterm-time\u201d. This is contrasted with the\nclaim that Sherliker has called no general meetings this academic year, and\nthat only two Management Committee meetings have taken place over the\nsame period.\nAn emergency meeting of the Executive Council has been scheduled for\nWednesday the 19th of March to decide on the no-confidence motion.\nGilead Amit\nThe Times Higher Education (THE)\nGrant-Thornton Vice-Chancellors\u2019 pay\nsurvey for 2006-7 has been released,\nrevealing the annual salaries of more\nthan 150 UK university vice-chancel-lors (V-Cs), or equivalent positions.\nImperial Rector Sir Richard Sykes tops\nthe list with a salary of \u00a3348,000 over\n2006-7, a 6.7% increase from the year\nbefore. Sir Richard is one of only two\nV-Cs to have an annual salary of over\n\u00a3300,000, with Professor Laura Tyson\nof the London Business School being\nthe second.\nAn IC spokesperson made it very\nclear that \u201csalaries for all of Imperial\u2019s senior staff, including the Rector [take] into account the demands of\nthe job and the successes achieved.\u201d Of\nall the V-Cs mentioned in the GrantThornton survey, Sir Richard is the\nonly one in the top five to receive no\nmoney from his university towards his\npension fund, and thus \u201cthe value of\nhis remuneration is less than stated in\nreal terms.\u201d Even with his pension contribution simply added to his annual\nsalary, however, Nottingham V-C Sir\nColin Campbell only gets \u00a36,000 more\nper year than Sir Richard Sykes.\nAccording to the THE academic pay\nsurvey for the last academic year, released simultaneously, the average salary for IC staff is just under \u00a344,000,\nwith the aforementioned London\nBusiness school paying an average of\n\u00a3132,769 over the same time period.\nFull academic pay tables should already be available online from the THE\nwebsite.\nGilead Amit\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFriday 14 March 2008 felix\nPolitics\nRaphael Lemkin spent much of\nhis life trying to get \u2018Genocide\u2019,\na term he coined from the greek\n\u2018genos\u2019 (family, tribe, or race)\nand the latin \u2018cide\u2019 (killing), rec-ognised. His first attempt to gain\nrecognition for the subject was\nin 1933 when he presented an\nessay on the \u2018Crime of Barbarity\u2019 to the League of Nations. It\nwas not however until 1948 that\nhis \u2018Crime of Barbarity\u2019 was formally recognised in international law. He died of a heart attack\nin 1959, in New York. Sadly, and\nperhaps unfairly, his funeral was\nonly attended by seven people.\nRaphael Lemkin\nfeel, at the event was contained within\nthe three questions regarding interven-tion. The different speakers interpreted the right of intervention, and who\nhas it, differently. The question is by no\nmeans trivial and concerns the tension\nbetween the sovereignty of independent nations and humanity\u2019s obligation\nto protect humans from abuse, vio-lence, and genocide. In 1999 and 2000,\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nencapsulated the problem by asking:\n\u201c\u2026 if humanitarian intervention is,\nindeed, an unacceptable assault on\nsovereignty, how should we respond to\na Rwanda, to a Srebrenica \u2013 to gross\nand systematic violations of human\nrights that affect every precept of our\ncommon humanity?\u201d\nDr.Smithplacedtherightofintervention in the hands of the U.N. Security\nCouncil, stating that any international\nintervention must be authorized by\nthe U.N. The other speakers disagreed\nwith Dr. Smith\u2019s assertion. Mr. Gorski\nargued that any group of nations has\nthe right to intervene if the motivation\nis to protect citizens; however, he conceded that it was ambiguous and was\nunable to address how large a group of\nnations must be before they have the\nright to intervene. Dr. Eltringham contradicted Dr. Smith\u2019s statements most\nstrongly. The U.N. in fact does not\nhave the right, under the U.N. charter,\nto intervene in cases of genocide. The\nU.N. is mandated to maintain international peace and security, he reminded\nus. Therefore, internal issues (one of\nwhich may be genocide) are not within\nthe authority of the U.N. or the Security Council. Instead, Dr. Eltringham\nargued, we must intervene through\nthe monitoring of human rights, specifically via the voluntary International\nCovention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Racial Discrimination. Signatories to the convention have agreed\nto monitoring, therefore the Convention\u2019s Committee have the authority to\nintervene. \u201cRespect human rights and\nyou avoid genocide\u201d, he declared. However, Dr. Eltringham failed to explain\nwho has the right to intervene in the\ncase of non-signatories or when direct\nmilitary action is required.\nAlthough all signatories to the U.N.\nConvention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide\nhave a duty to prevent genocide, the\nprevailing political wind is more likely\nto determine who has the \u2018right\u2019 to in-tervene. Mr. Koundarjian\u2019s argument\nGreg Stanton\u2019s 8-Stages of Genocide\nIn 1996, Gregory H. Stanton,\nPresident of Genocide Watch,\ndescribed the eight stages of\ngenocide and preventative measures that should be taken at each\nstage.\n1. Classification\n\u2013 All cultures have categories to\ndivide people into \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019.\nBipolar societies that lack mixed\ngroups are most likely to experience genocide, e.g. Rwanda.\nPrevention\n\u2013 Insititutions that transcend ethnic and racial divisions are the\nmost effective defense at this\nstage. The Church is an example\nof an insitution that could play\nthis role.\n2. Symbolization\n\u2013 Derogatory words and symbols are given to the classifica-tions, for example \u2018Gypsies\u2019.\nPrevention\n\u2013 Hate speech and symbols can\nbe legally banned. Without widespread cultural support, how-ever, the banning of hate speech\ncan be ineffective. However, with\nsupport the denial of symbolization can be extremely effective.\n3. Dehumanization\n\u2013 The humanity of a group is\ndenied in order to overcome the\nnormal human revulsion against\nmurder. Hate propaganda begins to appear in popular media.\nComparisions with vermin and\ninsects are made.\nPrevention\n\u2013 Leaders should condemn the\nuse of hate speech. Hate propaganda should be banned from\nmedia and hate crimes should be\npromptly punished.\n4. Organization\n\u2013 Genocide is always organized\nusing militias to provide denial of\nstate responsiblity. Organization\ncan be informal or decentralized.\nPrevention\n\u2013 On the international stage, membership of these militias should be\nillegal. Arms embargoes should\nbe applied against the nation and\ntravel bans should be put on their\nleaders.\n5. Polarization\n\u2013 The groups are driven apart.\nLaws may forbid marriage or social interaction. Extremists target\nmoderates and silence the political\ncentre.\nPrevention\n\u2013 Security and assistance should\nbe provided to moderates and human rights groups. The assets of\nextremists should be seized and\nextremist governments should face\nsanctions.\n6. Preparation\n\u2013 Victims are identified and physically seperated out from the rest of\nsociety. They are confined to fam-ine-struck regions, sent to camps,\nor forced into ghettos.\nPrevention\n\u2013 A Genocide Emergency must be\ndeclared and international armed\nintervention should be prepared.\nHeavy assistance should be provided to the victim group and at\nthe very least humanitarian aid\nshould be prepared for the inevitable tide of refugees.\n7. Extermination\n\u2013 The mass killing, legally called\ngenocide, is an extermination to\nthe killers because their victims\nare not believed to be fully hu-man. Sometimes the genocide\nresults in revenge killings, creating a downward sprial of genocide on both sides.\nPrevention\n\u2013 Only rapid armed intervention\ncan stop genocide at this point.\nReal safe areas and refugee escape corridors should be established with heavily armed international protection. If the U.N.\nis paralyzed, regional alliances\nmust act. The international re-sponsiblity to protect transcends\nthe individual nation\u2019s narrow\ninterests.\n8. Denial\n\u2013 This is the surest indicator of\nfurther genocidal massacres. The\nperpetuators hide the evidence\nin whatever way possible. They\nblock investigations and continue to govern with force until they\nare driven from power.\nPrevention\n\u2013 Certainly, by this stage, all that\ncan be done is to prosecute the\nperpetrators. The International\nCriminal Court is appropriate for\nthis function. The political will to\narrest and prosecute must exist.\nhttp://www.genocidewatch.\norg/8stages.htm\n\u201cRespect human\nrights and you\navoid genocide\u201d\nseemed the most pragmatic of all the\nspeakers. He emphasized the need for\ninternationalinstitutions,notnecessar-ily the U.N., to take the lead rather than\nindividual states. NATO\u2019s intervention\nin Kosovo was ideal, considering the\npolitical disagreement at the time between veto-holding Security Council\nmembers such as Russia and the U.S.;\nif we followed Dr. Smith\u2019s emphasis on\nthe U.N., or Dr. Eltringham\u2019s focus on\nhuman rights, it is unlikely that effective action would have occurred.\nThe question of timing of intervention produced a varied response. Mr.\nKoundarjian looked to political neces-sitation to inform his answer. Without\nsubstantial political clout and media\nsupport, any intervention will be hampered in its efforts. In order to garner\nboth political and media support, any\nmilitary intervention must be timed to\nbalance the need to prevent death and\nthe need to portray an intervention\nas urgent. He pointed to the military\nintervention in Kosovo as a model of\ngood timing. On the other hand, political intervention must occur as early\nas possible. A political solution is difficult to achieve once the violence has\nstarted, he stated. The longer the violence has been ongoing, the more difficult a political solution becomes, as\nwe have seen in Palestine. Again there\nwas significant disagreement between\nMr. Koundarjian and Dr. Eltringham.\nDr. Eltringham rejected the idea of intervention as something that happens\nwhen the threat of violence arises.\nIntervention, through the\nmoni- toring of\nhuman rights, should be constant and\nlong-term. Although the continuous\nmonitoring of human rights does not\nfit in well with a culture of bold media\nheadlines and short political sound-bites, it is a system that prevents escalation and genocide. Ultimately, he\nadmitted, the success stories are rarely\npublicized. The system is long-term\nand \u2018boring\u2019, it\u2019s not interesting to the\nmedia and politicians who \u201conly want\nto react to horror stories\u201d.\nThe steps that we as a society take\nto prevent genocide must reflect the\ncomplexity and multi-faceted nature\nof the issue. Each speaker admitted\nthat regardless of how we organise a\nmilitary intervention, it must always\nbe the last resort. A military intervention is a sign of failure rather than suc-cess; it shows us that we have failed to\nprevent human rights abuses and that\nwe have failed to tackle discrimination\nand prejudice between peoples. The\nmilitary is only needed when violence\nis imminent or already begun and by\nthis stage we have to ask ourselves,\nas an international community, why\ndidn\u2019t we act sooner? Dr. Smith said\nthat: \u201cVictims of genocide fall outside\nthe Universe of moral obligation\u201d. They\nhave been separated from the rest of\nsociety, attacked within popular cul-ture, and dehumanised. In order to\nprevent further cases of genocide we\nneed to have the courage to stand up\nand identify prejudice and condemn it.\nIn the UK, the treatment of travellers\nfulfill the first three stages of genocide.\nThey are already socially excluded\n(admittedly by choice) and one has to\nlook no further than the Daily Mail for\nhate propaganda. The origins of genocide are so small, that it is difficult to\nbelieve that they need to be addressed.\nHowever, the well-documented path\nto the Holocaust shows us that\nfrom small origins, humanity can move quickly to\ncommitting terrible\nviolence.\n\u201cthe media and\npoliticians only\nwant to react to\nhorror stories\u201d\n\n"

Rosie Grayburn\nvisits the gemlike Wallace Collection in Manchester Square for her weekly dose of gallery enlightenment\nS\no you\u2019re walking down Oxford Street and you suddenly\nhave a revelation: \u201cRight! I\nhave had enough of spending not a lot of money on\nclothes made by children: I am going\nto get out of here!\u201d So you take a left\nafter Selfridges and find yourself in\nManchester Square. On the other side\nof the square sits a huge, regency town\nhouse. You know the sort: they appear\nin period dramas and contain ladies\nsipping Darjeeling in pristine white\ndresses. This is the Wallace Collection\nand it is very cool.\nHereford House was owned by the\n1st four Marquises of Hereford and was\none of their main townhouses in London. The Wallace Collection presents\nthe art, furniture and artefacts collected over 4 generations of this family. I\nthink Marquises are far more decadent\nthan Earls. If Earl Grey was a stuffy\nold man like Twinings portray him,\nthen the Marquis of Hereford was his\nyounger, more exciting distant cousin\nwho travelled the globe and courted\nlots of exotic females. This is certainly\nthe impression I get from their collection here. Visiting the Wallace Collection is not like visiting any ordinary\ngallery in London \u2013 it is a mini palace!\nIn the downstairs rooms, extravagant\nmusical clocks overlook every expensive fireplace and chime on the hour to\nthe tune of a 17th Century smash hit.\nEat your heart out, Chris Moyles at\nBreakfast: these guys had Mozart\u2019s latest hit to wake them up in the morning\nwith tinkling ivory and solid gold!\nDownstairs you find the 17th century galleries. I loved the portrait of\nthe Earl of Leicester. He was clearly\nrolling in it, wearing a beautiful orange\nbeaded jacket. Unfortunately, the artist probably didn\u2019t like him very much\nand had spitefully included a huge,\nhairy mole on the side of the Earl\u2019s face\nwith wonderful detail for each hair.\nOther highlights in this gallery are the\nChinese sceptres made in the form of\na sacred fungus and the painting An\nAllegory of True Love. This brightly-coloured piece showed a group of jovial people sitting in the countryside\nhaving a picnic. However, this was no\nordinary picnic. Some of the ladies\npresent had pulled down their dresses\nand were putting off some of the men\nfrom eating by exposing their boobies\nand pinching their own pert nipples. I\ncould definitely see some true love in\nthe men\u2019s eyes but I still don\u2019t understand the title of the piece.\nThe Treasure of the Month was\nhoused in a glass case at the back of\nthe 17th century gallery. It is a Bohemian Welcome Glass, or a willkomm\nhumpen. All glasses should be made\nlike this. It holds about 2 pints and is\nengraved with a kind of user guide. The\ndiagrams on the glass are segmented\ninto categories of revelry and overin-dulgence. Gothic inscriptions around\nthe edge translate as \u2018\u2018Lift me up, drink\nme up, set me down, fill me again and\nbring me a good brother again\u201d which\nrefers to the tradition of passing the\nhumpen to another guest to down.\nSounds like your average night at the\nunion. This allegory also extends to the\n\u2018overindulgence\u2019 section of the glass\nwhere you see a youth vomiting violently on a tree. He obviously had too\nmuch humpen.\nOn leaving the Smoking Room, you\nascend some dark winding stairs that\nare worth hanging around on, at least\nuntil you start to look a bit suspicious.\nSmall paintings line the wall and the\nsubjects are amusing and varied if you\ncare to look, and they remind me of\nscenes you can imagine coming alive\nas if the place were Hogwarts. There\nare assassins waiting for their prey, a\nRoman feast, a circumcision ceremony\nand some cows munching placidly on\nsome tasty grass. These paintings are\nthe calm before the storm as the upstairs galleries showcase room upon\nroom of Dutch Landscapes and well-known masterpieces.\nInto the bright first gallery upstairs\nyou are greeted with the aforementioned Dutch Landscapes. Inside the\nwide country scenes of fields or ocean\nthe little vignettes around the canvasses make you spend more time looking at them than you probably should.\nThere are women gossiping about the\nmen, men perving on the women, the\ndog taking a piss on someone\u2019s property and shepherds making the sexytime\nwithshepherdesses.These(apparently)\nshow everyday life in the 1700s, which\nis the only thing that makes this inter-esting, as the art isn\u2019t particularly fine.\nApart from those \u2018soap opera\u2019 paintings of everyday life, there are multiple\npaintings of mythological scenes like\nthose where Gods lie around in the\nDutch countryside with their animal\nfriends while other lesser Gods suckle\ngoats. Those divine beings are weird.\nI am very, very happy when we finally\nreach the Great Gallery as I find there\nare about three Velazquez paintings in\none corner! Unfortunately they are not\noriginals, even though they are from\nhis studio. This means that he or one\nof his minions made more than one of\nthe paintings when they were found to\nbe popular. I would recommend the\nbooklets that are available in the Great\nGallery as they tell you interesting\nsnippets of info about each painting.\nWith regard to The Lady with a Fan,\nthey mention that she had a scandalously low neckline for Spanish women\nof that time, which meant she was\nprobably French\u2026\nI loved the Portrait of a Flemish Lady.\nShe sports a humongous lace collar\nand she is getting her serious Belgian\nbling on as she carries a massive chain\naround her waist. Unfortunately for\nher, this is probably a chastity belt.\nThere are several Rembrandts in the\nGreat Gallery. I hadn\u2019t seen a Rembrandt in real life before and there is\na serious wow-factor when you really\nlook closely. The detail on the fabrics\nhe paints is remarkable! Another famous face in this gallery is that Laughing Cavalier \u2013 you would immediately\nrecognize it if you saw it. His face is so\nreal \u2013 it could be a photograph -, and\nhe looked as though if I\u2019d cracked one\nof my many witty jokes he would have\nthrown back his head and roared with\nlaughter!\nOn leaving the Great Gallery you\nenter a room of miniature portraits.\nThey\u2019re fascinating in the way they are\nlike ours that we would perhaps keep\nin our wallet of our boyfriends or girl-friends. I guess soldiers commissioned\nthem to be painted of their sweethearts if they were off to war. What I\nfound quite amusing was the variety\nin the styles of portrait\u2026 there were\ntwo styles. Half the portrayed girls had\nbuttons done up to the neck or had demure dresses on. They were the wives\nor the betrothed. The other half had no\ntop on or had a cheeky nipple poking\nout. These were the mistresses. Those\n17th Century soldiers had invented an\nequivalent of dirty magazines to take\nto war!\nI skipped one room full of cityscapes.\nAlthough it was probably historically\ninteresting I wasn\u2019t going to waste my\ntime looking at the renaissance equivalent of a postcard of Piccadilly Circus.\nThe room called \u2018The Boudoir\u2019 was my\nfavourite as all the portraits had really\nunusual facial expressions and there\nwas a really cool writing desk which\nhad secret compartments hidden behind dummy book covers so you could\nstore the portrait of your mistress and\nother things from your wife. Another\ninterestingartefactinthisroomwasthe\nposter advertising a sale of all furniture\nand paintings from the Petit Trianon\nchateau. The Petit Trianon was built in\nthe grounds of Versailles for the King\u2019s\nmistress Madame de Pompadour. It\nwas given to Queen Marie Antoinette\nafter that. You know the story. So all\nher indulgent belongings in this \u2018mini\u2019\npalace were being sold off - Marie Antoinette had no use for them anymore,\nas the guillotine had unfortunately removed her head. Boo.\nHidden away downstairs under the\nrestaurant is a small exhibition room\nwhich is currently playing host to an\nexhibition called \u2018Masterpieces from\nthe Louvre\u2019. It is a grand name for a\nvery tiny exhibition. It\u2019s like calling\nyour pet hamster \u2018King Louis XIV\u2019\nor your hole of a flat \u2018The Mansion\u2019.\nI had imagined at least a \u2018Great Gallery\u2019 sized exhibition space to display\nthese \u2018Masterpieces\u2019, but instead there\nwas one well-known painting and a\nstudio copy of a well known Velazquez\npainting in a room filled with generic\nFrench School outputs. The exhibition\nis a small fraction of a much larger collection in the Louvre which belonged\nto Louis La Caze, an art collector and\na contemporary of Sir Wallace. For the\nWallace collection it is a big deal having this association with such an important organization as the Louvre but\nit really isn\u2019t a big deal for anyone visiting it. Stick to the caf\u00e9 upstairs.\nNow that is a big deal. My tummy\nlikes the Wallace Restaurant. Thankfully someone else paid - it is very\npricey but very, very yummy. It\u2019s popular with fancy-looking ladies who lunch\nand there was a huge waiting list for a\ntable. You couldn\u2019t have expected anything less from the Wallace Collection\nreally \u2013 you sit on grand wrought-iron\nseats and sip delicate tea and munch on\ndainty cakes or exquisite light lunches.\nThe Wallace Collection is a good afternoon\u2019s entertainment sorted, after\nyou\u2019ve done the galleries, caf\u00e9, lovely\nloos and the shop. Next time you\u2019re on\nOxford Street, spare a thought for the\nWallace Collection just tucked away\nbehind the bustling crowds. It\u2019s a real\npiece of heaven away from the chaos\noutside.\nMasterpieces from Le Louvre: The\nCollection of Louis La Caze is on\nuntil 8th May. Admission is free\nthroughout, but expect to pay\nthrough the nose for a postcard\nor a cuppa!\nI was inclined to focus more on the restaurant part of the piece but the Ed wasn\u2019t having it.

    "content": "39\nfelix\nFriday 14 March 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nAlone in the gym? Grab a workout partner!\nHolly Plumley\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nWhen it comes to training in the gym,\nthere are usually two types of people:\nthose who prefer to work out with a\npartner, and those who prefer to go it\nalone.\nHaving a workout partner has a variety of advantages \u2013 it can be hugely\nmotivating, make your training sessions more enjoyable and can keep you\ncommitted to maintaining the number\nof training sessions you do each week.\nThe choice of who you should share\nthis time with depends on a few factors such as training goals. Few workout partners are successful at reaching\ntheir goals if one wants to do cardio\nwhile the other focuses on strength\ntraining. You should have some of the\nsame goals i.e. to complete a marathon,\nto lose weight, to gain strength.\nIf you don\u2019t choose your workout\npartner wisely, you could find your\ngym visits suffering as your partner\nwill become more of a distraction than\nanything else. Here are some examples\nof the types of workout partners there\nare and ones I see daily in the gym:\nThe Spotter\nIf you are someone who is constantly\npushing yourself by trying to go for\nyour one-rep max or just progressively\nby ensuring you are overloading your\nmuscles with each session, a spotter is\nessential.\nA spotter will be there if you start to\nfalter during a lift, and could potentially save you from a very serious in-jury. Knowing that this person is there\nfor you also offers a psychological advantage because most people, when\nthey know they will be backed up by a\ncouple of extra hands, can actually lift\nmore than they thought they could.\nDon\u2019t overestimate how much help\nyou will actually be getting either.\nWhen it comes to getting you out of\na tight situation, a very gentle upward\npull on the bench press for example will\nbe more than enough to give you that\nlittle extra to hoist the weight back up\nto the top of the lift. So, for confidence\nand safety, find a workout partner who\nis a good spotter.\nThe Mentor\nIf you are new to weight lifting just be\nsure that when you choose someone\nto show you the ropes, you are choosing someone who knows what they are\ndoing. While usually a muscle-bound\nbody is the result of good training and\nhard work, some people may not entirely know what they are doing in the\ngym and you don\u2019t want to pick up their\nbad habits. Also make sure they are offering the right support and guidance\nfor your specific training goals.\nThe Socialiser\nThe worst type of workout-partner-ship to have is where one of you really wants to have an intense workout,\nwhile the other would rather spend\nmore time hanging around, looking in\nthe mirror and chatting with the odd\nset thrown in between conversations.\nThis mindset is slightly less common,\nbut every gym usually has at least a few\nSunday February 22nd saw the second\ninstallment of the Imperial College vs\nOxford University chess match. Started in 2006 to end the Oxford Cambridge duopoly, the Valentine\u2019s Cup\nwas meant to be an annual fixture.\nDisappointingly, following our crushing victory in 2006 on foreign soil,\nOxford copped out of a revenge fixture\nlast year claiming they would prefer to\nplay a tournament between themselves\nand therefore had no time to play us.\nThis year, however, they finally roused\nenough courage to accept our offer for\na return match in London.\nBut the landscape has changed in\nthe university chess-playing hierarchy in recent times. Whereas two year\nago we were clear underdogs, this year\nmany of Oxford\u2019s better players have\ngraduated and others couldn\u2019t stomach\nthe journey down to London. Added\nto this, a few weeks before the match\nit was discovered that one of England\u2019s\ntop fifty players, International Master\nSimon Ansell, was doing a one-year\nMasters at Imperial College. With already a quite strong team and Ansell\nleading the way we would start the\nmatch as clear favourites.\nGiven that we had only found out a\nfew weeks earlier, we were sure that\nhaving an International Master on\ntop board would come as a surprise to\nthem. That is, until I CCed their team\ncaptain in an email to our team! With\nall our team names in the address bar,\nthe cat would be out of the bag as soon\nas their team captain would read the\nemail so a swift cover-up operation\nwas called for. Realising my mistake,\nI decided to recall the message. With\nthe culprit email sitting right next to it,\nhowever, recalling it just once would\nonly arouse suspicion. I therefore sent\nout forty recall emails to swamp his inbox and ensure that he would click on\nthe recall one before even realising the\noffending one was there! This did not\nwork. Not one of the anticpated \u201cmessage recall has been successful\u201d notification was received.\nThe match consisted of eight games\npitting our eight best players against\ntheir best eight. With one point for\na win, half for a draw and none for a\nloss, at least four-and-a-half points are\nneeded for a win. Looking at the makeup of the teams it was clear that we had\nthe edge on the top four boards where\nthe stronger players were playing but\nthat on the bottom four it would be\nfairly evenly matched. This was borne\nout early on as I won quickly on board\ntwo and Simon looked to be cruising\non board 1. Three hours in to the five\nhour match, Imperial\u2019s Tom Fuller\nwas crushing his opponent on bottom board and though Simon Ansell\nhad been held to a draw we were two\nup with four to play and looked to be\ncoasting to an easy victory.\nThen, in the space of 15 minutes,\nthings suddenly went to pot. First\nhaving done well to survive a dodgy\nopening IC\u2019s Jason Klimach blundered\na couple of pawns to end up in a lost\nendgame. Then Imperial\u2019s Justin Hadi,\na fomer Oxford undergraduate him-self, fell for a cheap checkmate from a\nposition that looked certain to end in\na draw. And though Tom cleaned up\non board eight, it wasn\u2019t long before\nwe were one point down with just one\ngame left still playing.\nIn the key game our player, Peter Levermore, playing black, had a\nslightly better position and was trying\nto convert it into a win while all the\ntime being careful to avoid the game\nsuddenly evaporating into a draw.

    "content": "3\nVarsity Highlights The ACC\u2019s view\nMy last varsity has just been and\ngone. No longer will I be able to\ncompete alongside my fellow students studying \u201cproper\u201d courses and\nshow the medics how to play sport\n\u2026 still, I get the pleasure of summing up Varsity from an ACC point\nof view. I am sure that the rest of this\npullout will be filled with relevant\nbanter and detail about how we managed to dominate most of the sports\nand how rugby gave it their best shot\nbut sadly came second once more. I\ndon\u2019t have that much more to add, so\nI shall be brief.\nWhilst the rugby match is often\nseen as the main showpiece, with\nthe crowds, the rector, the chants,\nand the big shiny cup you must remember the vast number of sports\nentering in the day\u2019s competitions\nwith each being a battle worth win-ning. This is a huge credit not only\nto the vast range of facililties that we\nhave availible to us, but also to the\nwide range and dedicated sporting\nstudent population we have. To host\nall these fixtures on a Wednesday afternoon takes a tremendous amount\nof organisation. Thanks must go\nout to every captain who has managed to field a team and those who\nwork alongside coaching staff to\nproduce teams we can be proud of.\nAlso to those unsung heros without\nwhom we would be lost at most fixtures who ensure that the pitches/\ncourts are suitable and ready, and to\nthose who coordinate the fixtures to\nmake sure a suitable programme and\ntransport can be found. So a great\nbig thank you to everyone involved.\nThat\u2019s sounding rather a lot like\nan Oscar acceptance speech, isn\u2019t\nit? Without wanting to lessen our\ngratitude I will swiftly get back to the\ntrue meaning of varsity, IC beating\nthe medics in most sports, and the\ngood-humoured rivalry that festers\nbetween our great sporting sides.\nThis rivalry, whilst occasionally seen\nas a negative thing, produces wonderful one-off performances when\nthe club feels it matters; whether\nit is Mr. Nedic striking a catalogue\npose in his undies whilst waiting\nfor replacement shorts on the side-line, the cool and collected head of\nthe hockey captain scoring a winning sudden death p-flick, or just a\nthoroughly annoying gold-trousered\n\u201cphoenix\u201d prancing around the umpires \u2026 nobody can deny the special\natmosphere a varsity day holds and\nthat most definately is something to\nbuild on and celebrate.\nThis just leaves me just to point\nout again how we beat the medics in\nthe majority of sports, and how all of\nthe IC sportsmen should join us in\ncelebrating this great achievement at\nthe ACC Dinner on the 18th March,\nwhere we will be presenting our annual sportsman and team of the year\nawards as well as colours. Ask your\nclub captains for details.\nMary Williamson\nACC Vice-Chair\nVarsity Special\nVarsity \u2013 that annual extravaganza\nof sport, booze, and banter which\nclearly shows us why the separation\nof medic and non-medic clubs is one\nof the strongest aspects of Imperial,\nand so should never be touched! The\nprovision of medic and non-medic\nclubs is a fantastic thing that is\nshared by us all; be in no doubt that\nwe all would pay the price if it were\never to be changed!\nI don\u2019t think there is anyone, even\nthose hiding in the dark corners of\ntheMechanicalEngineeringbuilding\nwho would not agree that this was\nthe best Varsity yet, one which I am\nsure will set the standard for years to\ncome. The JPR Williams match was\nprobably the closest and most exciting yet, with Imperial proving that\nthey fully deserved promotion to\nthe BUSA Premiership, and a young,\nfresh-faced Imperial Medicals side\nscrapping to a nail-biting 22-19 victory which puts them well on their\nway to making it 10 years in a row.\nI am delighted to see that the \u201clove\u201d\nbetween medics and non-medics is\nstill flowing, and that in most sports\nthe competition was tight, providing\nsome excellent viewing. Through\ngrated teeth I must however congratulate Imperial on winning the\noverall Varsity day 13.5-8.5.\nI want to congratulate all those\nteams that took part, in particular\nICSM Netball led by Catherine Atkin, and Imperial Medicals RFC led\nby Ruiaridh Crawford, for the fantastic achievement of winning a full\nhouse in their respective sports. I am\nfully confident that next year we will\nsee a rampant ICSM follow the lead\nof Netball and Rugby to return and\nwin back the overall Varsity compe-tition, proving that quality is much\nbetter than quantity when it comes\nto students!\nFinally on behalf of ICSM I would\njust like to thank all those involved\nin what was another fantastic Varsity day. In particular I would like to\nthank all those in Sport Imperial and\nICU for all the hard work they put in\nto ensure its continued success.\nGuy Martin\nICSMU Clubs &\nSocs Officer\nNetball 4th\nNetball 3rd\nNetball 2nd\nNetball 1st\nSquash Mens 1st\nSquash Mens 2nd\nSquash Womens\nBasketball Mens 1st\nBasketball Womens 1st\nWaterpolo\nHockey Womens 1st\nHockey Womens 2nd\nHockey Mens 1st\nHockey Mens 2nd\nLacrosse Mixed\nFootball Mens 1st\nFootball Mens 2nd\nRugby Womens 7s\nRugby Mens 2nd\nRugby Mens 3rd\nBadminton Mens 1st\nBadminton Mens 2nd\nRugby Mens 1st\n10\n17\n22\n38\n5\n5\n0\n134\n96\n10\n6\n2\n2 (5 on pens)\n0\n15\n5\n3\n18\n3\n0\n8\n8\n19\n15\n34\n24\n42\n0\n0\n3\n55\n8\n1\n2\n1\n2 (4 on pens)\n0\n3\n1\n1\n5\n13\n43\n0\n0\n22\nImperial College\nvs\nImperial Medicals\nOVERALL SCORE\n14.5 8.5\nWaking up last Wednesday morning, I\nfelt the nerves kicking in and I wasn\u2019t\neven competing!\nNo matter how much planning you\u2019ve\ndone or how many contingency plans\nyou\u2019ve made, running the Varsity event\nis as nerve-racking as competing in it.\nI know just how important the Varsity\nis for many students at Imperial and I\nfeel nervous for all of them! I love looking back on the day and picking out my\nfavourite bits.\nLooking back as one of the organis-ers, there wasn\u2019t too much to worry\nabout in the end and there were definitely more highlights than low lights.\nHere are my top five favourite bits of\nthe JPR Williams Rugby match:\n1. A draw at full time for the first\ntime in Varsity history\nWhat a game! I don\u2019t think people\nexpected a draw \u2013 I know I certainly\ndidn\u2019t. Both sides deserve a lot of credit\nfor providing us with an incredibly entertaining match to watch. It was exciting from the first minute and kept\nus on the edge of our seats all the way\ntill the final whistle at full time and of\ncourse into extra time.\nThe Imperial end of the stands went\ncrazy when their side were leading 6\npoints to 3 but then the Medics\u2019 end\nmatched their counterparts\u2019 vocal efforts when the score was equal at half\ntime. The second half was even more\nthrilling with more nail-biting tension\nas Imperial were leading once again\nwith 19 points to 14 when lo and be-hold, the Medics came back and scored\na try resulting in the full time draw of\n19 all. Great stuff!\n2. An Imperial player receiving the\nMan of the Match award for the\nfirst time\nThe results were in at the end of the\nmatch (finally) and yes the Medics won\nfor the sixth time but for the first time,\nJPR Williams awarded Man of the\nMatch honour to an Imperial player\n\u2013 hooker and kicker Alex Johnstone.\nAlex even got the opportunity to say a\nfew words \u2013 not a normal occurrence.\nWell done Alex!\n3. Felix Sports Editor Takes His\nKit Off!\nFelix Sports Editor and Imperial\nprop, Jovan Nedic, publicly removed\nhis shorts (after they split!) and, would\nyou believe, replaced them with a new\npair! He was as speedy as possible but\nwe all saw it! It almost made up for not\nhaving any streakers this year.\n4. Having over 1000 people there\nWith an array of people at the game\nfrom players, students, College, and\nUnion staff, VIPs, guests, parents of\nplayers, coaches, physios and medics,\nmatch officials, Sport Imperial staff,\nlocal residents, and anyone else who\ndecided to come along and watch, I felt\nvery proud to see that everyone seemed\nto be enjoying themselves. Every single\nperson there contributed to the amazing atmosphere on the night and particular acknowledgment must go to the\nvery vocal supporters at both ends of\nthe stand. I am sure both teams appreciated your efforts \u2013 we certainly did!\n5. The Boy in the Golden Trousers\nI don\u2019t know his name but he was\nthere in his splendidly golden, shiny\ntrousers supporting the Medics. He\nhimself was very inoffensive and indeed rather sweet. His trousers on\nthe other hand \u2026 I did actually bump\ninto him the following day and as well\nas looking rather bashful and embarrassed when he recognised me he also\nlooked like he\u2019d had a bit of a rough\nnight. Thanks for the entertainment\nour boy in the golden trousers.\nThere were lots more great moments\nfrom the day and if I could mention\nthem all I would! Thank you to all the\nplayers and spectators for making the\nevent such a pleasure for the Sport Imperial team to organise!\nLeena Bharadia\nSport Imperial\n\n"

    "content": "music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nFriday 14 March 2008 felix\nMusic\nThese next few weeks are shaping up\nto be rather splendid for debut album\nreleases. Foals\u2019 \u2018Antidotes\u2019 has been\nslowly climbing up the ranks of my\nLast.FM recently, and expectations\nare high for Youthmovie\u2019s \u2018Good Nature\u2019 which drops next Monday. If that\nsounds a little too guitar-based to get\nyour ears salivating then fret not as\nMit\u2019s \u2018Coda\u2019 arrives on the 17th with\nsome synthy krautrockesque minimal\nelectronic post punk...\nJust to get this out the way before I\nstart, I love this album. I\u2019ve been trying\nto write this review for ages but keep\ngetting lost in the music every time I\nput it on. This is the second week in a\nrow that Music Felix\u2019s pages have been\nfilled with contributors waxing lyrical\nabout Mit and there\u2019s a reason for itthey\u2019re fucking awesome. I\u2019m sorry to\nput it so bluntly and un-poetic-like but\nthis album really is quite excellent.\nMit make minimal electronic music\nthat sounds dark and brooding but is\nalso really danceable. With only three\nmembers - one singer, one drummer\nand a moog fiddler/programmer/ad-ditional drummer - the tracks have\na certain wide and open feel to them\nwhile managing to stay engaging and\nimpossible to stand still to. Lead singer\nEdi Danartono\u2019s vocals are delivered in\na haunting high pitch and with a sense\nMit poised to take over the universe\nof urgency that seems to drag the rest\nof the music along. Even though the\nsinging is pretty much exclusively in\nGerman, this album is still definitely\naimed at the British music crowd with\nMit playing in London more often than\ntheir hometown of Cologne. The fact\nthat the lyrics are pretty much indecipherable to most of us adds so much\nto the songs. It removes the connotations and emotions that words bring\nAfter the somewhat lacklustre \u2018Hotel\u2019 release in 2005, and the \u2018Greatest\nHits\u2019 compilation from 2006, it seemed\nsafe to contend that the world\u2019s most\nchilled-out DJ had slipped into something of a creative nadir after the glory\ndays of \u2018Play\u2019. However, if the single \u2018Alice\u2019 is to be seen as a credible foretaste\nof the forthcoming album \u2018Last Night\u2019,\nthen we might reconsider.\nAnyone who is even vaguely familiar\nwith Moby\u2019s back catalogue will know\nhe has a soft-spot for collaborations.\n\u2018Alice\u2019 is no different, as it features\nthe rappers Aynzil and the 419 squad\nthrowing some meaningful rhymes in.\nSingles: Moby\nand Gnarles\nBerkley\nMit\nCoda\nHalf Machine Records\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\u2018Mit\u2019 is German for \u2018With\u2019\nwith them, allowing the vocal sounds\nto speak for themselves.\nAlbum opener \u2018Beispiel\u2019 starts with\ndark atmospheric sounds and whirling\nnoises which are scarily reminiscent\nof the soundtrack to David Lynch\u2019s\n\u2018Eraserhead\u2019. A heavy bass drum enters followed by automatic sounding\ndrums. A lot of the album has a very\nmechanical feel to it with repeating\nsamples and beats flowing past each\nother with ease and regularity, which\ncontrasts beautifully with the expressive vocals. This works particularly\nwell on \u2018Gibt Es Denn Keine Anderen\nGrunde\u2019 where distant screams of agony fade in and out as if being tortured\nby some giant clockwork machine. Mit\nhave created an album which you can\nlisten to at home but also on the dance-floor, with each song working perfectly\neither on its own or in the overall context of the album.\nSynth heavy tracks such as \u2018Park\u2019\nhave an immediate attraction, but it\u2019s\nthe songs that seem more unapproachable on first inspection that are Mit\u2019s\nmost accomplished, such as \u2018Genau An\nDiesem Abend\u2019 which builds up slowly\nwith repeated vocals until screaming\nwhat sounds like \u201cI like dancing\u201d. Coda\nis incredibly impressive as a debut album and Mit are definitely a band to\nwatch out for in the next few months.\nJames Houghton\nMoby\nAlice\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nGnarls Barkley\nRun\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nGnarls Barkley are of course the product of the collaboration between Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo Green that became a household name following the\nrelease of the infectious single \u2018Crazy\u2019.\n\u2018Run\u2019 is our first taste of their latest al-bum, entitled \u2018The Odd Couple\u2019, and\nI\u2019d say it is an all right song. It is quite\nupbeat, with Cee-Lo\u2019s familiar soulful\nsinging, and features colourful chants\nfrom a children\u2019s choir, but lacks originality somewhat. Gnarls Barkley continue in the same vein as their previous\nreleases, and don\u2019t seem to be doing\nanything particularly new with \u2018Run\u2019. It\ndoes however have mainstream appeal,\nso it will probably be a success.\nMit Shah\nThe track begins with a heavy industrial bass-line, analogous to the\nnew Nine Inch Nails, which is then\nimmediately supported by some rapping and what could perhaps be called\n\u2018rap-singing\u2019. The heart-felt \u201cThis is the\nwrong road / This is a dark road\u201d chant\nin the chorus sets forth the socio-polit-ical theme of the song in a refreshingly\nnon-clich\u00e9d manner.\nAlthough Moby hasn\u2019t evolved much\nthematically with this song, it is soni-cally a lot more heavy and angst-ridden\nthan his older material (although diehard fans will know that he did play\nin a hardcore-punk band at one time).\nSome fans may not wholeheartedly\nembrace this sudden change in style,\nhowever those who appreciate Moby\nfor the dynamic and genre-defying artist he is will welcome this with open\narms.\nUshnish Banerjee\nAchieving success in music without\nselling out to the generic indie juggernaut must be the holy grail of all young\nmusicians. Maintaining one\u2019s originality is all too hard when the temptation of seemingly-easy success by just\nsqueezing one\u2019s music into the indie\nmould with its ready-made scene and\nan army of fans is open to all up-and-coming four-pieces. Ironically, the ones\nthat do go it alone and try to succeed\nwhile sounding original, often achieve\nthis so-called originality by borrowing\nfrom the past. Nu-rave Klaxons and\nStone Roses\u2019 sound-a-likes Kasabian\ntestify to this. This tends to lead to\nstrangely familiar sounding songs, and\nridiculously convoluted genre names.\nNu-rave is bad enough but the genre\n\u2018post-punk revival\u2019, championed, for\nexample, by Interpol, is outrageously\na revival of post-punk which itself is a\nmore introspective and experimental\nslant on punk rock. So it seems original\nsound is gained only at the expense of\nvandalising genre names and borrowing from the past.\nUntil recently this grave-robbing had\nnot reached so far as the tombs of the\nrock \u2018n\u2019 roll fathers of rock. This past\nyear, though, has seen the re-emer-gence of rock and roll. Typically inven-tively, this \u2018new\u2019 genre has been termed\nrock \u2018n\u2019 roll revival. Lost and Found, Richard Hawley, Kitty Daisy and Lewis,\nand Vincent Vincent and the Villains\n(VVATV) all hark back to the \u2018and the\u2019\nbands of the 50s and the innocent roots\nof rock and roll.\nHappily, this isn\u2019t \u2018nu-rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2019, but\ninstead a tribute to the sound, spirit\nand feel of the early days of rock. These\nbands not only sound like a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\nband, they also go to great lengths to\nlook like one. Lewis, of Kitty Daisy\nand Lewis has a large Elvis-style quiff,\nand VVATV make a point of wearing\nauthentic period attire at their live\nperformances.\nMusic today has become synthesized\nand knowing, to the extent that bands\nregularly employ people to determine\nwhich single should be released first\nin order to rake in maximum returns.\nHaving existed with only limited success since 2003, VVATV cannot be\naccused of such gold-digging. Their\nlyrics, too, are refreshingly innocent,\ntalking of pretty girls and sweet girlfriends and crammed with joyous\n\u201cwhoop\u201ds and \u201cWa Doo\u201ds. The music\nitself is not all that bad either, packed\nwith catchy riffs and sharp turns of\nphrase.\nFormed in 2003, VVATV, formerly\nThe Double Card Bastards, are headed\nby Vincent Vincent (real name: Vincent Cusano) who originally shared his\nfront man duties with Charlie Waller.\nControversially, Waller was also front\nman in rival band Rumble Strips and\nthe tension and pressures created by\nthis situation eventually led to his leaving VVATV. Happily, the split proved\nan inspiration to VVATV who produced their first major release \u2018Johnny\nTwo Bands\u2019 off the back of it. It was\nnot all bad for Waller also, who has\nhad greater success with Rumble Strips\nand tellingly, unlike Vincent Vincent,\nhas his own Wikipedia page.\nIn their infancy, VVATV, intent\non staying true to their rock and roll\nsound, cannot have expected much\nsuccess. Indeed in VVATV\u2019s first release \u2018On My Own\u2019, in 2004, Vincent\nVincent admits \u201cI\u2019m on my own / In\nthis world of rock and roll!\u201d and sings\n\u201cI don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s approval / I\u2019ll\nlive without it happily\u201d. That is until\nlate 2006 when they were signed up\nby EMI \u2013 the first rock and roll band\nto be signed by a major record label in\ntwenty years, thereby confirming its\nresurgence. They have since released\nsingles \u2018On My Own\u2019 and \u2018Pretty Girl\u2019\nand with their album \u2018Gospel Bombs\u2019\nout this Monday they seem destined to\ncomplete an unlikely success story.\n\u2018Gospel Bombs\u2019 comprises exuberant songs overflowing with verve and\nvitality. The songs generally take the\nform of a story. \u2018Pretty Girl\u2019, for exam-ple, tells the tale of a girl Vincent sees\nin the frozen section on aisle four at the\nTesco store, and always means to ask\nfor her number \u201cBut she didn\u2019t see me\nat all\u201d. In \u2018Sins of Love Wah Do\u2019, Vincent\nairs his views on jealousy with comic\ndepictions of Adam and Eve, and Bonnie and Clyde.\nThe opening song, \u2018Beast\u2019, is as high-spiritedastheothersbutdarestosound\nless rock and roll. It features a trumpet\nand flamenco-sounding guitar produced using Pro-Tools software and\nfiercely tells the story of a Beast inside\nof Vincent which causes his relationships to fail. Prior to the disappointingly lethargic final song, the penultimate\nsong, \u2018Telephone\u2019 is absolutely storm-ing, driven by a compelling baseline\nand the lyrics \u201cI\u2019m waiting by my telephone / Waiting for my favourite beat\n/ Now when my telephone rings / You\nknow I just can\u2019t stop tugging my feet!\u201d.\nThese excellent lines are typical of the\ngenerally high quality song-writing on\nthis album.\nThe genre has been done and the\nchord progressions are very similar in\neach song, but Vincent Vincent and\nthe Villains do rock \u2018n\u2019 roll with such\nvim and vigour that this is nonetheless\na very enjoyable record. And with rock\n\u2018n\u2019 roll revival on the up it looks like\nthey might be one of the privileged few\nwho achieve that holy grail of sounding\nfresh and actually succeeding.\nRafe Martyn\nVincent Vincent & The Villains album\nVincent Vincent and the Villains have a long fucking name. They also have an album\nwhich came out last Monday. The awesome and talented Rafe Martyn had a listen\nVincent Vincent & The Villains\nGospel Bombs\nEMI\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nVincent Cusano of VVATV\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFriday 14 March 2008 felix\nPolitics\nDry Wit & Tonic\nWatch out! Change is coming!\nOn Monday, a paper is being submitted to Council to help ensure Felix can report on news important to you\nKadhim Shubber\nOn the front of this newspaper are\ntwo token protests, barely visible to\nthe casual eye. The symbol of Felix,\nthe cat, has been gagged and also the\nword \u2018newspaper\u2019 has been changed\nto \u2018news\u2019paper. On Monday the Union\nCouncil will discuss a paper submitted\nby Tom Roberts, Felix Editor. Unlike\nthe token protests on the front page,\nthis paper will help ensure that Felix\u2019s\neditorial freedom is protected and by\nremoving ambiguity within the rules\ngoverning Union publications, allow\ngreater freedom in reporting news\nthat is of interest to Imperial\u2019s student\nbody.\nIn the Union Constitution, Felix is\ndescribed as an independent student\nnewspaper that is \u2018Editorially Free\u2019.\nHowever, there are two main reasons\nwhy this in practice is not always the\ncase. Staff-Student Protocol and Election Regulations override, rightly or\nwrongly, the editorial freedom of the\nFelix Editor. However, I concede that\nthe Felix Editor should operate under\ncertain rules. Felix does not exist in a\nbubble and there are definitely responsibilities that come with Editorial Freedom. But because these rules are for the\nmost part to be interpreted, editorial\nfreedom in certain cases disappears.\nContent is sometimes decided, albeit\nindirectly, by the Union. Importantly,\nthe interpretations can unfortunately\nbe wholly inconsistent with a free press\nand reporting in the public interest.\nI would not suggest that the Union\nPresident has direct control over the\ncontent of Felix, and I\u2019m certainly not\nsupposing that the Deputy President\n(Finance and Services) controls whether or not Felix is published. However,\nFelix is part of the Union and is financed by the Union. The President,\nas head of the Union, has a responsibility for the Union\u2019s activities. If the\nUnion were to be sued because of a Felix publication, we would ask what the\nPresident knew and what he/she did to\navoid getting into a legal mess.\nAccording to Election Regulations,\nno story may be published on an individual who is standing for election; a\nstory must be about all election candidates or none at all. \u201cA candidate could\ncome into the Felix offices and smash\nup the computers, and we wouldn\u2019t be\nallowed to report on it\u201d, commented\nFelix on 15th February. This restriction on free speech is not justified, as it\nis detrimental to the elections. Student\nvoters should be given information\nthat is relevant to their decision making and certainly the misdeeds of an\nelection candidate is important\nto voters. I agree that publicity shouldn\u2019t be given to a\ncandidate over others;\nhowever, I disagree\nthat this means\nthat the misdeeds of a candidate should\nnot be\nreported.\nThere is\nno doubt\nthat the\nSabbatical Electionsheld\nthis year\nwere suc-cessful.\nTurnout\nand participation\nwere relatively high\nand unlike\nprevious elec-tions, the word\nfarce was nowhere\nto be seen. This was\nof course due to the enthusiasm of the sabbatical\ncandidates but also because\nthere was a determination within\nthe Union that the elections should\npass smoothly. Therefore, in this case,\nthe Union President\u2019s interpretation of\nthe electoral regulations was cautious\nand focused on avoiding controversy;\nit was judged that a smooth election\nwas more important than the publication of certain stories. This is a decision that should be made by the Felix\nEditor; again we see that the room for\ninterpretation within the constitution\nremoves editorial decisions from the\nFelix Editor. It is not the job of Felix to\nensure that the elections pass smoothly and certainly this should not be a\ndeciding factor when choosing stories\nthat are in the students\u2019 interest.\nThe world of the Staff Student Protocolisalegalminefieldbutthisjusthigh-lights the need to remove ambiguity\nand introduce clear but fair guidelines\nfor\nFe- lix. Imperial College Union is an employer,\nand all employers have a duty to protect their staff. However, the Union is\ndifferent to most employers, as it has,\nsupposedly, an editorially independent\nstudent media. This creates pressures\nthat other employers do not experi-ence, such as protecting its staff from\nharassment by fickle students while\nalso respecting the right of the student\nmedia to report factually in the public\ninterest. The Staff Student Protocol is\nsupposed to tackle this complicated\nissue, but it fails to do so adequately.\nThe balance cannot exist presently.\nAn over-cautious sabbatical team will\nalways choose to enforce the SSP in a\ndraconian manner and therefore degrade the freedom of the student me-dia; a more lenient sabbatical team,\nwhich we may have next year, will be\nmore willing to let some stories be\npublished. The variability is\ndamaging to the credibility\nof Felix as a student news-paper. The motion proposed by Tom Roberts\nintends to remove\nthis variable interpretation to SSP\nandthereforeen-sure that SSP is\nused fairly, re-sponsibly, and\nconsistently.\nWith these\nthings in\nmind, cast\nyour mind\nback to the\nFelix issue\nwith the blank\nfront page.\nThe issue published on Friday\n15th of February contained\nthree stories that\nwere interpreted by\nthe Union President\nStephen Brown as violating Election Regulations\nand Staff-Student protocol.\nThe interpretation that he made\nwas a cautious one and certainly Mr\nBrown would not deny this. He then\nadvised the Felix Editor that the publication of the articles would probably\nresult in the impounding of Felix (this\nmeans that the issue of Felix would be\nconfiscated and distribution would\nbe stopped). Why didn\u2019t Tom Roberts\nignore the Union President? Student\nnews website Live! published 2 of the\n3 stories in question, in an article and\non a discussion board, in defiance of\nthe Union\u2019s advice. Firstly, Felix and\nLive! use different mediums. Whilst\nan article on Live! can easily be re-moved, the issue of Felix would have\nbeen impounded, and around 40 pages\nof content, of students\u2019 effort, would\nhave gone to waste. Secondly, there are\nmore appropriate ways to make your\nvoice heard, without wasting your contributors\u2019 effort, namely the aforementioned paper to the council.\nLet me make myself clear: It is not\nthe relationship between the Union\nand Felix that is abhorrent. There is\nnothing intrinsically damaging about\nthe President advising the Felix Editor\non the likely consequences of a publi-cation. It is the interpretative nature of\nthe rules governing Union publications\nthat is damaging and it is this that the\npaper successfully tackles. It re-words\nthe rules so that it is clear what Felix\ncan or can\u2019t publish, what will or won\u2019t\nget Felix impounded and ensures that\nthe Felix Editor must only live by these\nrules, not also by the interpretations of\na cautious Union President or a zealous election candidate.\nThe failings of Union departments\nand election candidates are in the student interest and should be reported\nupon. There is a problem with the regulations regarding the student media;\nthey are subject to the interpretation\nof people with interests other than the\nreporting of news. As a result the students of Imperial are deprived of information that is important to them. This\ncannot continue if we are to maintain\nthe credibility of Felix as a \u2018newspaper\u2019. It is not wrong that the Union has\ntoken involvement with Felix or that\nthere are regulations; it is wrong that\nthe Union has the power to choose the\ninterpretation of these regulations.\n\u201cFelix shall be\neditorially free\nto operate and\nreport on events\nas the Editor\nsees fit\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "6 felix Friday 14 March 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nDear Felix,\nIn Response to \u2018Insert Witty Name\u2019s\u2019\nAngry Geek Idol article, in the hope\nthe editor loves divisive arguments as\nmuch as any other newspaper editor\ndoes...\nI will leave aside the fact that anybody\ncould have known what type of person\nthe writer was from the piece without\nthoughtlessly revealing that they were\n\u2018at a show\u2019 because of the artistry of\nsuch a stunningly clever title, matched\nwith an equally clever pseudonym.\nVarsity is an occasion for celebra-tion, no matter the outcome, because\nit promotes competition. I know the\nliberal thinking is that competition is\nbad and that stupid fat kids shouldn\u2019t\n\u2018lose\u2019 at games because it might damage their self esteem, obviously there\nwas no axe to grind on that topic! But\nit turns out competition is good (ask\nany biologist, it will make them happy\nas they are hopelessly derided the rest\nof the time); without competition Sylvia Plath would never have been born\nso that \u2018arty\u2019 non sportsmen could cry\nover her poetry before she offed her-self, sadly she did somehow managed\nto reproduce her\u2019s (and Ted Hughes\u2019)\ngenetic material (twice) before committing suicide. Competition is why\nthe human race evolved and continues\nto, so in order to spur human development I will personally campaign for\na Shakespeare recital at Varsity next\nyear.\nFurther to the above, releasing all\nthat pent up aggression in a rule based\narena stops people committing other\natrocities such as brawling, or writing\nbitchy snipey letters to newspapers.\nThis helps people be accepting of all\npeople, whether they are people who\nget some fresh air and hack a football around for a while, or sit with the\nmothballs leafing through a poetry anthology so they can steal a few obscure\nmetaphors.\nThe Farcity of Varsity: A retort\nA. Fan\nL\nast week was that time of\nthe year again when the\nnewly elected Felix editor\nis announced. Understandably this is a busy time for\nthe paper and I will assume that was\nthe reason for a lapse in editorial dis-cretion; a view I explain below.\nFirstly, to spend 2 and a half columns\nof a 4 column article complaining\nabout the behaviour of rugby players\nafter having been told that they were\nfootballers and admitting that you cannot distinguish between the two, stinks\nof incoherent argument.\nIf conditions really were as bad as described (balaclava-clad \u2018rugby players\u2019\nholding people \u2018hostage\u2019) then please\nhave a word with the bouncers. They\nare there purely because it is fully expected that a Student Union may get\nrowdy once in a while \u2013 that none of\nthe professionals (neither the bouncers\nnor the SAS) deemed it necessary to\nget involved speaks volumes.\nHowever, surely the most heinous\naccusation is that sport takes precedence over all else at the university.\nFilling the Union bar once a year is no\ngreat inconvenience, especially when\nthere are at least 10 (15+) bars, pubs or\nclubs within a mile of the union; otherwise Leicester Square is a 90p bus-ride\naway.\nI suggest that rather than trivially\ncriticising what you recognise as the\nroaring success of Sport Imperial, you\nembrace it and work with it to see how\nyou can develop the Art Imperial you\nso bitterly wish you had. Lobby the new\nsession of Union representatives for\nArt activities to be a valid Wednesday\nafternoon pastime. If you can demonstrate reasonable numbers in support\nof this I find it hard to see how they can\nrefuse.\nDrinking to excess is something that\nthe majority of students do on a reasonably regular basis, normally with a\ngroup of friends. The connection with\nsport is that these tend to be a group\nof your closest friends (almost describable as a team); and more often than\nnot they are the friends that you genuinely will keep in touch with after uni.\nIf you don\u2019t drink/don\u2019t want to drink\nthen you are not forced to and from\nexperience other team members are\ninvariably tolerant (even if not under-standing) of this. Asserting otherwise,\nor even failing to clarify this, is the\nsort of ill-researched speculation that\nwill only serve to unfairly drive people\naway from something that it appears\nthe majority of other students enjoy\n(1100 attendants at Varsity is somewhat impressive by Imperial standards\n\u2013 competing even with the Arts Week\nBarn Dance).\nFinally, to the Olympics. An initial\ncost of \u00a32bn does not seem unreasonable when compared with an estimated\nimmediate \u00a33bn in additional tourist income and creation of 75000 new\njobs. Obviously I cannot explain how\nthe Government has managed to treble their spending, but I doubt they intended to do so and incur such public\noutrage. However I would put it to you\nthat equivalent investment in the theatre industry certainly would not reap\nanything like that return and that serious government investment in a sector\nas unpredictable as the film industry\nis incredibly imprudent in a time of financial unpredictability.\nI hope this helps to answer any ques-tions/voice any frustration that others\nmay have had after reading Felix Comments last week and I encourage you\nto note that I am not a member of IC\nRugby and this has not been written\nin consultation with them; it is just the\nthoughts of one of the many fans.\nLetters to Felix\nVarsity promotes\ncompetition\nLove,\nNot-so-angry Sportsman.\nDear Felix Politics,\nI'm writing to express deep disappointment in your coverage of the political\nsituation in Kenya.\nAccording to Felix, as per 7th March\n2008, talks aimed at power sharing in\nKenya have stalled. As per reality, talks\nin fact were successful, when both sides\nsigned a power sharing agreement on\nthe 28th of February. Since then, Mr\nAnnan has left the country leaving remaining mediation duties in the hands\nof Nigerian diplomat Mr Oluyemi\nAdeniji, parliament has reopened and\nfour bills tabled aimed at legal reforms\nand the re-introduction of the post of\nPrime Minister, which Mr Odinga will\nhold. All of this has been covered by\nlocal and international media, and it is\ndifficult to imagine that anyone actually interested in the Kenya situation\ncould have missed it.\nThe story you ran is more late than\ninaccurate, but as journalists you will\nprobably know that one is just as bad\nas the other. In a situation as serious\nas Kenya's your article's misleading\nnature depicts at best an editing team\nthat is out of touch with reality, and at\nworst one which is happy to uphold the\nstereotype of Western journalism, preferring coverage of African problems\nto coverage of African solutions.\nI know a couple of you guys person-ally, and I have great respect for the\nwork you've done turning Felix around\nthis year. But in this situation I feel, as\nmany Kenyans I know at IC, that a correction and an apology is due.\nRegards,\nAnthony Maina\nMisleading and\nmistimed Kenya\narticle\nDear Anthony Maina\nApologies if the article appeared mis-leading. We concede that the article\nwas out-of-date and a caveat should\nhave been included to inform readers\nof the developments in the situation.\nAs Politics Editor I do not wish to reject contributions but I concede a mistake has been made here. We reject the\naccusation that we are interested in\ncovering African problems rather than\nAfrican solutions. Thank you for contributing an article on developments in\nKenya for this week.\nKatya-Yani Vyas (author of said ar-ticle) and Kadhim Shubber (Politics\nEditor)\nDear Felix Politics,\nI am writing to complain about the\nPolitics article in this week's Felix, on\npages 14 and 15, entitled 'The facts\nabout the Lisbon Treaty'.\nThe subtitle describes the article\nas a \"fair and balanced analysis\". This\ncouldn't be further from the truth. The\narticle is unremittingly pro-EU.\nIt is taken as read that European Union is a good thing, and that British\nsovereignty over all areas of legislation,\nnot just those the EU is prepared to\ngive us 'vetos' (which aren't all they are\nmade out to be by referendum-avoid-ing politicians, see http://www.parlia-ment.uk/parliamentary_committees/\neuropean_scrutiny/escpn271107.cfm)\nis unimportant.\nAt one point, the author even criticises Britain for having \"disrespect for\nEurope and our neighbours\", committing the usual pro-EU commentator's\nfallacy of conflating Europe (i.e. the\npeople) with the EU (i.e. the politi-cians). This is done so opponents of\nLisbon Treaty\narticle: Unfair\nand unbalanced\nthe EU power structure can be painted\nas 'little Englanders', i.e. xenophobes\nwho hate the French, the Germans,\nthe Belgians etc etc, rather than opponents of a corrupt, anti-democratic\norganisation.\nThe below link is not my blog, but\nI hope you and perhaps the author of\nthis purportedly unbiased article will\nfind it interesting: http://eureferen-dum.blogspot.com/\nIan Grieve\nPhD Student, Hammersmith\nCampus\nDear Ian Grieve,\nWe disagree completely that the article\nwas not a \u201cfair and balanced analysis\u201d.\nAs an article on the Lisbon Treaty, arguments for and against, and the consequences of the treaty were considered\nobjectively. The article did not make a\njudgement on whether membership of\nthe EU is beneficial but instead discussed the positive or negative impact\nof the Lisbon Treaty.\nThe sentence \u201cdisrespect for Europe\nand our neighbours\u201d is nonsense when\nremoved from the context of the para-graph. It was written in relation to the\nprinciple of common EU law for all\nmembers.\nSincerely,\nJames Goldsack (author of said ar-ticle) and Kadhim Shubber (Politics\nEditor)\nPolitics satire a\nbit too close to\nthe reality\nDear Felix,\nAs I was saying the other day, I think\nthe article in last week\u2019s paper (\"Appar-ently war is awesome...\") was inappropriate and I was offended by the tone\nof the article.\nIt says that several societies have broken up which is not true and it has a\nquote from \"Leroy Weatherfield\" who\ndoes not exist. What I found most offensive is that it tries to make a joke out\nof the fact that soldiers are dying. The\nfact that Prince Harry enjoyed his duty\nin Afghanistan does not show anything\nabout what it is like for ordinary sol-diers, as he wouldn't have been put\nin any dangerous situations. It is also\nquite racist, talking about \"shooting an\nArab\".\nI understand that this column may\nbe supposed to be a satire, however\nthis particular article is not satire (as\nsatire should be ironic and intelligent,\nand the comments in this article are\nmerely coarse!)\nI am disappointed that articles like\nthis can get into Felix.\nIt would be good if you could print\nan apology this week from the Politics\nEditor for not making it clear if, as you\nsaid, this was a satire. It would also be\ngood to say that the article was not at\nall factual. The Stop the War Society\nwould like to say that we are far from\nbreaking up, in fact we are going to a\nnational World Against War demonstration this Saturday! (meeting in Beit\nQuad at 11.20am)\nThanks\nCaroline\nDear Caroline,\nI\u2019m sorry that the satirical article \u201cApparently war is awesome\u201d offended\nyou. Of course the article isn\u2019t factual,\nit\u2019s a satirical piece not a news article.\nComedians often makes light of dark\nsituations, like war, and Samuel Black\u2019s\narticle was hardly ground-breaking in\nthis respect. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be printing an apology; I trust that the readers\nof the politics section are intelligent\nenough to spot satire when they read it.\nKadhim Shubber (Politics Editor)\nThey\u2019ll be cheering Shakespeare\nfrom the stands at next year\u2019s\nVarsity apparently\n\n"

With their\nchic look and a great response from\nthe media, with appearances on Jules\nHolland and heavy radio play, our expectations were high.\nKicking off at around 1 in the morn-ing, The Ting Tings were loud, energetic and got the crowd moving. They\ndid not, however, impress us in the\nslightest. The core problem with The\nTing Tings is that live they sound like\nyour mum shouting at you because\nyou\u2019ve done some stupid shit. Like a\njackhammer that won\u2019t quit, The Ting\nTings made me put their music aside,\nfor my sanity\u2019s sake, and start to focus on other things: When is the last\nbus home ? Is that a man or a woman?\nWhat\u2019s that smell, is it me? Ranting\naside, we have to admit that it wasn\u2019t\nan ideal venue \u2013 the sound quality was\npoor, and none of the rich texture from\ntheir studio-produced tracks was evi-dent. So let\u2019s give credit where credit\u2019s\ndue and look at what the gig could have\nbeen like.\nAs we\u2019ve already told you, The Ting\nTings are just Katie on vocals/guitar\nand Jules on drums/vocals, and together they come up with a big sound that\nThe Editors\u2019 sell-out show at Alexandra Palace\nThe Editors have it all. Getting signed,\nselling truck loads of albums and singles alike, and embarking on tours\nworldwide in a space of roughly 5 years\n- they are the paradigm of the rock and\nroll dream that millions of struggling\nmusicians would die for.\nThe Editors electrified the stage at\nAlexandra Palace in every sense of\nthe word. Being a palace, this majestic venue cannot but exude grandeur,\nbefitting a four piece that are currently\nkings of the castle in the ever-shifting\nprecarious music industry.\nWaiting in the freezing cold for\nwhat seemed like an eternity before\nthe doors opened was definitely not a\nhighlight. And if one was to be truly\nhonest, the two supporting acts, Morbius and Sons & Daughters, were simply not up to scratch. But, here\u2019s where\nit gets good.\nWhen the lights went out, we all\nknew that it was time. Time to treat our\nears to colossal noise and scintillating\nsoundscapes. The Editors showcased\ntheir top-drawer repertoire of songs\nboth from their debut platinum album\n\u2018The Back Room\u2019 as well as equally\nstunning material from their second\nalbum \u2018An End Has A Start\u2019 that shot\nThe Editors\nAlexandra Palace\n5th March, 2008\nTom Smith (of Editors fame) live at Alexandra Palace\nstraight to number one after immediate release last summer.\nThey took to the stage, setting off to\na flying start with the hauntingly ethereal \u2018Camera\u2019, taken from \u2018The Back\nRoom\u2019. Synthesizers filled the entire\ngreat hall along with the entrancing\nthrobbing bassline, hooking the crowd\nwith a devouring sense of brooding ee-riness, which was palpably compounded by the smoke that slowly swarmed\naround the hall. What a way to start the\nball rolling, if it means sending shivers\ndown one\u2019s spine. It truly did. \u201cLook at\nus through the lens of a camera / Does\nit remove all of our pain?\u201d Tom, the\nvocalist asks. Surely you can\u2019t wipe out\nsuffering as easily as a look. Life would\nbe just too simplistic and colourless. \u201cIf\nwe run they\u2019ll look in the back room,\nwhere we hide all of our feelings\u201d.\nBelters with the likes of \u2018All Sparks,\nMunich\u2019, \u2018Blood\u2019 and \u2018An End has a\nStart\u2019 took to crashing effect as all received furiously rapturous reception.\nThe dramatic swooping soundscapes\nwith tremendous guitar workout by\nfrontman Tom\u2019s strong vocal delivery\nreminiscent of Ian Curtis, and pulsating drums had no trouble spawning frantic excitement and a dynamic\nvibe amongst the thousands that were\npresent at this hair-raising perform-ance. With these killer hook-laden\ntunes, fans went mental, shouting,\nsinging and screaming at the top of\ntheir lungs. Heavy chorus crescendoes\nand roaring drums and bass dominated\nthe scene as showstoppers \u2018Fingers in\nthe Factory\u2019 and \u2018Bullets\u2019 boomed from\nall corners. Everyone was on their feet,\njumping to the perennially-repeated\nlines of \u201cKeep with me, keep with me\u201d\nand \u201cYou don\u2019t need this disease\u201d. The\ncrowd could not help but also take\nan irrevocable liking to the compelling guitar refrain in \u2018Escape the Nest\nand Bones\u2019 which crushingly took\nour breaths away. The set was highly\nenergetic and the band conveyed a\nsurprisingly array of different atmos-pheres. A change in ambience made a\nsweet contrast in softer, tender tracks\nlike \u2018Distance\u2019 and toned down \u2018Fall\u2019. \u201cI\nwanted to see this for myself\u201d. You certainly should have been there to have\nbeen spoilt and cocooned in the exqui-site, mesmerising cacophony thanks to\nsuch an electric live set.\nAs it was Russell the bassist\u2019s birthday that night, we all showed our love\nand appreciation by singing \u2018Happy\nBirthday\u2019. What a way to spend your\nbirthday - playing to your beloved fans.\nHe wasn\u2019t complaining one bit.\nIt is the sheer raw power of the music\nand the wave of energy that captivated\nthe thousands of us there under the\nthunder and lightning. The night could\nnot end without an encore. So we had\n\u2018Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors\u2019\nto finally appease our insatiable appetite before they departed the stage to\ndeafening applause.\nThe Editors live is nothing but terrific energy, great passionate music and\ntimeless delivery.\nSusan Yu\nThe Ting Tings standing in front of a wall, by the looks of it\nsustains through most of their songs.\nWith a rich texture most of their songs\namount to a very peppy poppy sound.\nJules is unrelenting on the drums, not\nletting the pace slow for a second. This\nwas obviously great for uplifting the\ncrowd, but with no real slow-down in\nthe pace or change in the hugeness of\nthe sound The Ting Tings leave you\ntired, as it\u2019s all a little bit too much. Katie helped things out with her melodic\nbreaks but we felt that they could\u2019ve\ndone a bit more, even if it was just pop\nrock.\nSo, as you might have gathered, the\nsound didn\u2019t really agree with us, but\nthe beauty of live music is that there\nis more going on than just the sound\nhitting you in the face and in this respect The Ting Tings were pretty cool.\nKatie has been known to stop mid-song to ask fans to stop filming and\nstart watching them, which should be\nsaluted. Sadly we didn\u2019t witness such\nbitchiness but Katie was pumped up,\njumping all over the place mixing it\nup with the crowd. Jules the drummer\nwas like a crazy toy monkey going wild\nevery now and again, considering he\u2019s a\ndrummer he had a pretty big presence\non stage, his mechanical thumping being a visual heartbeat for the songs.\nHowever, although visually entertain-ing, we still can\u2019t say we\u2019re big fans of\nThe Ting Tings.\nWith nothing interesting going on\nmusically, those of us who weren\u2019t\ncompletely inebriated and busy throwing bottles at surrounding people by\nthe stage were close to falling asleep\nby the end. If you missed it, you didn\u2019t\nmiss out.\nChris Birkett & Anthony Lazzaro\n(IC Radio)\nReality Check: The Teenagers\u2019 debut album\nThe Teenagers\nReality Check\nMerok Recordings\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\n\u2018Reality Check\u2019 is the debut album of\nchildishly-named French indetronica\nband \u2018The Teenagers\u2019. Being Parisians\nwho grew up in England, their music\nis an odd mix of British indie rock and\ntwinkling French electro. The album\nworks and flows well but it doesn\u00b9t\nhold to repeated listening. First time\nthrough, the songs spark of novelty\nand variety like the world of sex, drugs\nand alcohol does to the young, exemplified by the band\u2019s varying guitar\ndominance and volume. However, on\nrepeated listening, \u2018The Teenagers\u2019\nlustful nature abandons you at a party\nof wasted skin-loving fifteen-year-olds\nand leaves you with the realisation that\nit was all superficial. Ironically you do\ntake a \u2018Reality Check\u2019 - perhaps not the\none the band was intending though.\nThe singles \u2018Love no\u2019 and \u2018Scarlett Johansson\u2019 tend toward pop, and after a\nfew listens it is hard to distinguish them\nfrom generic indie. \u2018Scarlett Johansson\u2019\ndoes start promisingly with the spoken\n\u201cWe know you were born in 84 / Half\nPolish / Half Danish\u201d layered over pulsing guitars, but after the intro it could\nhave been any of their songs.\n\u2018Homecoming\u2019, \u2018The Streets of Paris\u2019,\nand \u2018Make It better\u2019 do linger in the\nmemory. \u2018Streets of Paris\u2019 has a driving narrative that keeps you hooked to\nthe end and \u2018Make it Better\u2019 has a very\ncatchy electronic bridge. However, the\nbiggest impression they leave is caused\nmore by cheap tricks , for example using the c-word, rather than their music\nbeing something special. No doubt this\nwill all pander to the interpretation of\n\u2018cool\u2019 of their natural fan base, and just\nlike in \u2018Feeling Better\u2019 where the band\nbigs themselves up, a pet hate of mine,\nit all smacks of a publicity stunt.\nI\u00b9m afraid to say \u2018The Teenagers\u2019\ndon\u00b9t manage to shake the prejudice\nthat comes with their band name but\nall that said it is much better than I ex-pected. If you\u00b9d like to see them yourself they are playing Cargo on the 7th\nof April.\nSarah-Emily Mutch\nThe Teenagers: Michael Szpiner, Dorian Dumont and Quentin Delafon\n\n"

    "content": "Rainbow shines as medics fall to Imperial 2nds\nAs the IC football team rolled off the\nbus on a mild February day in West\nLondon, the air was filled with the unmistakable stench of IC Football vic-tory. Not even the most optimistic of\nthe Medic Snouts could have predicted\na lucky draw; essentially they were being marched to their doom much like\nthe Burmese army towards John Rambo and a semi-automatic. The sweet\nanti-British chimes of the Wolfetones\nand continuous simulation of gunfire\nreduced the proverbial Medic package to a floppy 2-incher and a pair of\nmincy balls.\nPete Cunt\u2019s selected team set out\nto ridicule the Medic Seconds. The\npre-match team talk fused the finest\naspects of culture and street justice,\nquoting the \u2018Art of War\u2019 and the essential \u2018How to beat the 4-4-2\u2019. The starting line-up spawned few surprises,\nand after all the preparation we had to\nlive for something or die for nothing.\nIC immediately seized the initiative\nby dominating the centre of midfield\nwith a series of uncompromising chal-lenges, showing no mercy towards The\nNurses souls. The endeavour of the\nmidfield coupled with the energy in\nthe forward line brought by the \u2018White\nLightning\u2019-quick Rainbow and Swain\nresulted in the inevitable. The resistance of the Medic back line swiftly\ncrumpled in a fashion reminiscent of\nthe British Army against the Irish Republican movement; after good wide\nwork by \u201cKassabian the Turk\u201d the ball\ndropped to \u201cThe Frog\u201d who duly delivered a lighting bolt right through the\nupper-90.\nRainbow proved to be a constant\nblade in the side of the Medic\u2019s neck.\nThe IC backline on the contrary were\nrelaxing, enjoying ice-cold brewskies\nand drinking up their superiority over\nthe Medic McLovins. Despite their\ndominance they couldn\u2019t convert opportunities and the pressure to double\nthe advantage grew as the half drew\nto a close. IC\u2019s 2nd XI, however, live\nby the motto \u2018When you\u2019re pushed,\nscoring is as easy as breathing\u2019 much\nlike killing someone, and when a deep\ncorner was whipped into the box \u201cThe\nBearded-Oyster\u201d headed the ball goal-bound for \u201cDewy\u201d to bundle past the\nham-fisted Medics.\nThe champagne was ready to be\npopped until a moment of madness\nfrom the IC keeper. An innocuous\nfree-kick was speculatively driven long\ntowards the box. Blinded by the sun\nand distracted by his huge testicle the\nball bounced over Aubergine (soon to\nbe victim of a filthy pint) and into the\nnet. The team entered half-time somewhat subdued but confident of victory\nagainst the wank obstacle they found\nbefore them. Captain Cunt instructed\nus, \u201ctrue heroes never die, they just\nreload,\u201d and following some refreshments from Master\u2019s mum, the lads\nwere ready to do some more damage.\nThe second half proved to be an exhibition of complete control, the Medics rarely crossed the halfway line, with\n\u201cLobster\u201d keeping their winger firmly\nbetween his pincers. Rainbow continued to throw his weight around up\ntop and was unlucky not to get on the\nend of some fine midfield play from\nShaaz. Cue the introduction of 6th\nteam giants Adrian \u201cBus Fornication\u201d\nDoyle and \u201cThe Sex-Pest\u201d Killer to finally wipe this dog shit from our shoes.\nFlamboyant work from Gui \u2018The Favela Bellshiner\u2019 allowed him to swing a\nball in for Killer to shank to Doyle who\nsniped the ball goalward.\nThe rest of the game was played out\nat a canter with \u2018Pink Taco\u2019 penetrating the Medic rearguard with surging\nmovements. The game fizzled out and\nthe final whistle was met with rapturous screams from the mediocre rats\nthat made up the Smithy and Fitz\nfanclub. Fitz, unimpressed by comparisons of his face to a vagina, requisitioned \u2018swaliberta\u2019 from the rats and\ndestroyed it. After a quick consultation\nit was decided that the medics were\ntoo shit to merit a warm down, and we\nshould go support IC 1st XI.\nAnother year\nsees another\nfootball varsity retained at\na canter. The\nMedics put up\na good fight\nfor 45 minutes of the 1st XI\nclash, but in the second half\nclass told and we turned on\nthe style to score some excellent goals and simulate exquisite gunfire. The 2nd XI clash\nwas treated with comical\ncontempt with leavers from\nthe 3s, 4s, 5s, and 6s playing\nand winning comfortably. A\nnotable performance came\nfrom 4th XI captain and centre back Aubergine who was\nplaying his first ever game as\na goalkeeper. His only contribution was to watch the ball\nbounce over his head and\ninto the goal. \u201cGive the medics a chance,\u201d he thought. J.\nE. Rainbow was sent off within 20 seconds of his 1st XI debut for general skulduggery.\n\u201cIt was worth it and I\u2019ll do it\nagain\u201d he muffled through his\nbalaclava.\nCongratulations to the 1st\nXV rugby too, you actually\nmade it competitive! The 1st\nXI train rolls on to the Cup\nFinal this Saturday looking to\nretain our trophy once more.\nThe trident is ready, the firm\nare armed: the trophy awaits.\nGaro Torrosian\nCaptain\u2019s Corner\nJ. E. Rainbow\nFootball\nVarsity\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 3\nMedicals Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nFootball\nMedics no match for Imperial\u2019s finest\nAfter deciding that the Fagel Medics\nwere below their grade last year the\nfirst team decided to humour the scum\nthis year. Rumours of a silent confidence and a chance to get one over the\nbest team in London were on the lips\nof the Medics.\nReports were circulating that the\nMedic Captain was seen collecting Disability Living Allowance just\nlast week. IC Captain Pat \u2018Chipmunk\nHead\u2019 Farr told his troops to give the\nFagel an early goal \u2013 rumours that\nthis was the result of a payoff from an\nIranian match-fixing syndicate are un-confirmed. Nonetheless the wankers\ntook the lead with a shanked shot off\nTorossian\u2019s scrotum before agonisingly\ntrickling through the lettuce wrists of\n\u201cWhore\u201d.\nDespite this setback the ULU champs\nshowed little urgency and were content to keep possession and poke fun at\nhow bollocks the opposition was. Sami\nTyphallus then began to exert his efficient form of dominance administering\nfatal bouts of Bolivian SuperAids (The\nBad Type). Burkinshark\u2019s first half performance seemed subdued as he spent\nmost of it on the phone to multiple\nAmerican rats. Despite the contempt\ntowards the game the equaliser quickly\ncame, the DLA Medic Captain lost\npossession to \u201cShadow the Hedgehog\u201d\nHowson, who calmly strolled through\nand finished allowing the teams to enter the half level.\nIC\u2019s Skipper delivered a passionate\nteam talk informing the lads that the\nearth needed to be warmed with the\nsweet wine of Medic blood. Aulak,\nwhose blade is sharper than Rambo\u2019s,\nwas ready to dance, and dance he did.\nA four-goal second-half ensued with\nutter dominance being stamped over\nthe face of the opposition. Things got\nembarrassing as \u2018Fanny Batter\u2019 Wilson and \u2018Benny Boy\u2019 Payne pulled the\nstrings through the centre while \u201cEgo\u201d\nMartins ripped the medics to shreds\ndown the flanks. The unstoppable red\nriver flowed and the medics continued\nto leak goals at the rear as the Irvinator\ncompleted his hat-trick either side of a\nTyphallus goal. The IC 1st team really\nstarted to take the piss when \u201cBurkinshark\u201d passed the ball forward.\n4-1 signalled the entrance of Wellington DaSilva for his first team debut\nallowing Haugh a short stint up top. In\nwhat was otherwise a good game for\nthe ref, he harshly red-carded DaSilva\nin less than 10 seconds. Responding to\nremedial banter from a dirty stinking\nMedic snout DaSilva politely informed\nthe individual that he would have to\nJ. E. Rainbow\nFootball\nVarsity\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 5\nMedicals Men\u2019s 1st 1\nsee a proctologist if he kept slabberin\u2019.\nLater questioned about the incident\nDaSilva responded, \u201cI\u2019d do it again\u201d.\nDespite this, Martins placed the icing\non the cake with a well-finished goal.\nAfterwards, the Medic winger who\ncontroversially switched allegiances at\nthe start of the year gave no comment\nabout the game.\nJack \u201cThe Crane\u201d Britton did not\nbreak a sweat all game, and questioned\nthe validity of the competition, re-marking, \u201cMaybe next year it would\nbe better if they played a Fagel IC team\nlike Wye or RSM.\u201d Sport Imperial may\nbe looking into the possibility of this as\na more realistic varsity challenge.\nYet another Imperial goal going in\nThat tackle looks like it\u2019s going to hurt\n6 Varsity Special\n\n"

Still, at least it\u2019s not Phantom of the Opera\nJust another day on the mean streets of Putney We like France. Please resist the urge to be xenophobic.\nValjean and Cosette decide to flee Paris\nto escape the fighting, leaving Marius\nto mourn his lost love whilst Eponine\nattempts to flirt with him. Both Marius\nand Javert join the student rebellion.\nEnd of Act One (phew, I told you it was\nlong).\nAct Two starts with the students\nbuilding a barricade (the classic symbol of Les Mis) against the authori-ties. Cue a bit of a fight. Lots of people die, including some big characters\nand Valjean, who has joined the fight,\nhas to carry a wounded Marius away\nfrom the scene. Marius does not die\n(hooray!) and instead marries Cosette,\nleaving Valjean with nothing more to\nafter the revolution!\nSongs to listen out for\nOne Day More: You may have noticed\nI love big contrapuntal numbers. This\nis one of the best.\nOn My Own: Here\u2019s another song for\nyou to belt out when your flatmates are\nelsewhere.\nEmpty Chairs at Empty Tables: A\nbeautiful yet tragic song that has been\nused as a symbol for the AIDS struggle\namong gay men (listen to the lyrics and\nyou\u2019ll understand).\nI want it now!\nLes Miserables is still on in London\nat the Queens Theatre with day/stu-dent tickets (where you buy them on\nthe day from the box office) starting\nat \u00a317.50. If you don\u2019t fancy spending\nyour Wednesday afternoon off at the\ntheatre, the 10th Anniversary Concert\nDVD is available. There are also two\ndifferent copies of the CD in the library\n(so go get them now!).\nLike it? Try...\nI was going to offer you Urinetown, my\nfavourite musical ever, that parodies\nLes Mis massively, but there\u2019s no way\nfor you to find out about it, so I\u2019ll give\nyou an alternative:\nPhantom of the Opera- OK, I personally hate this show. But it\u2019s another long\nrunning West End \u201cSupermusical\u201d, also\nproduced by Cameron Mackintosh\nand with the same grand bravado as\nLes Miserables.\nFinally: the long and complicated\nplot of Les Miserables explained!\nIn another Musical Theatre Weekly, Lucy Harrold reveals what those crazy French people are really up to\nT\nhe book Les Miserables\nwas written by Victor\nHugo in 1862, gaining its\nreputation as a rather long\nand difficult book. JeanMichel Sch\u00f6nberg and Alan Boublil\u2019s\nadaptation was first performed in Paris\nin 1981 and it bombed. Oh. Cameron\nMackintosh, the producer of shows\nsuch as Cats and Starlight Express\n(generally all the big, British Eighties\nshows) thought Les Mis could work\nin the UK with a bit of tweaking. He\nbrought it to the Battersea Arts Centre\nin 1985 and later to its present home,\nthe Queens Theatre, where it is now\nthe world\u2019s longest running musical.\nPlot\nThis is going to take a while - both the\nbook and the show are notoriously\nlong. As there is a book, again, you can\u2019t\ntell me off for ruining the story. The\nshow starts with Jean Valjean being released on parole from the chain gang,\nhaving been imprisoned for the past\n19 years. Once released he stays with a\nbishop, from whom he steals a pair of\ncandlesticks (real clever, Valjean). He is\nnearly sent back to prison but is saved\nby the bishop, who lies for him. This\nincident will result in Valjean being\nchased throughout his life by Inspector \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d Javert. Cut to eight\nyears later and Jean Valjean is now\na well-respected mayor and factory\nowner who happens upon a troublemaker in his factory - Fantine. She is\nthrown out and resorts to prostitution\nto pay for the upkeep of her daughter\n(Cosette). Cosette is being \u2018looked after\u2019 by the Thernardiers, a rather nasty\ninn-keeper and his wife who dote upon\ntheir own daughter Eponine whilst\nill-treating Cosette. Fantine eventually dies, leaving Cosette in the care of\nValjean.\nNine years later and France has\nchanged due to their one decent leader\ndying (careless?!). A student revolution is about to begin led by Enjolras\nand Marius, a lovesick young man who\nfancies Cosette (who is now rich and\nboring). Unfortunately, Eponine also\nfancies Marius and hence the usual\nmusical theatre love triangle ensues.\ndo with his life, yearning for death.\nEveryone (including the dead people)\npromptly return for a good old singsong and some more marching.\nMain Characters\nJean Valjean: The story is seen through\nthe eyes of this reformed prisoner who\nacts as Cosette\u2019s guardian\nJavert: Jean Valjean\u2019s nemesis and the\npoliceman who arrested Jean Valjean\noriginally.\nFantine: Mother to Cosette - dies pretty early on in the play\nCosette: Daughter of Fantine, adopted\ndaughter of Valjean, lover of Marius\nMarius: The heartthrob of Les Mis,\nfriends with the leader of the student\nrebellion and going out with Cosette\nEponine: Daughter of the Thernardiers, spends most of the play skulking\naround Paris in a large overcoat and\nlusting after Marius.\nThernardiers: Owners of the local\npub where they make Cosette work as\na child in exchange for \u201clooking after\u201d\nher.

In fact, it was sufficiently ludicrous to warrant a piece\nitself \u2013 twice the length it should\u2019ve\nbeen, misdirected and misinformed,\nand through the kind of weather that\nwould make Noah consider getting the\ntwo-by-four out again. I\u2019m writing this\non the return journey (fuck the fourth\nwall) and the train is currently inclined\nat ten degrees, stationary, and I\u2019m being informed of a broken rail ahead\nwhich we\u2019re going to run over anyway.\nThis may not make the Felix presses.\nAnyway, more positive thoughts \u2013\nthe New Scientist. It\u2019s one of my guilty\npleasures, along with drinking litre\nbottles of Lucozade in one go and the\nsong \u201cTalk Dirty To Me\u201d by Poison. Of\ncourse I\u2019m aware that NS is one of the\ntabloids of science journalism, but that\ndoesn\u2019t make it any less bubbly or fun\nto read. You\u2019re more likely to get a plot\nfor a sci-fi novel out of it than you are\ninspiration for any real research, but\nthe journalism always knows how to\ncherry-pick the interesting scientific\nevents, and their features are generally\nworked up with a pleasing Dan Brownesque spin on them. This issue, for in-stance, there\u2019s four pages about their\nfavourite topic ever \u2013 Dark Matter. Is it\nreal? Is it fake? New Scientist yet again\nmanages to answer \u2018yes\u2019 to both questions with some great citations and\nthat really lovely graphic design that\ndecorates all of their pages.\nYes, I probably would adopt it if it\nwas a person.\nThe point is that New Scientist, however crazy or nonsensical it might be,\nmakes me happy to be a scientist. Fuck\n\u2018engineering\u2019, and fuck it good; engineers are just scientists who can\u2019t be\narsed to generalise. If you\u2019re going to\ndesign a bridge, then why not make it\neasier for the poor sod who comes after you to design the next one, right?\nAll right, enough of that. For now.\nI\u2019d imagine even engineers get a kick\nout of this sort of thing, even if it\u2019s not\nfrom this particular publication. As\nyou read each article, getting a taste of\nthose specialisms and subjects that you\nleft behind at A-Level, or second year,\nor graduation, you\u2019re suddenly back in\nFreshers\u2019 Week again, surrounded by\ndozens of people all with roughly the\nsame knowledge as you, but ready to\ntake it in hugely different directions.\nNew Scientist, like Facebook, joins\nthe dots. It makes sense of what you\u2019re\ndoing in context of a larger community\n\u2013 there are people all over the place,\nworking in different laboratories, under different grants and in different\nlanguages. But the more you read, the\nmore you\u2019re struck with that pleasing\nfeeling that they\u2019re all working on the\nsame research project. The abstract for\nthe proposal is just one line long, and\nit says this \u2013 \u201cWe aim to find out what\nto do next.\u201d\nIs that a bit schmaltzy? It sort of\nleaves a bad taste in my mouth, rereading it, but the adrenaline rush of\nsurviving the broken rail dash across\nopen, boggy countryside is too much\nto contain. And it remains that the lecturers that I admire end up doing real\nthings, adding to the pool of knowledge in a tangible way. Some of them,\nI\u2019m sure they\u2019d admit, end up piddling\nin it rather than pouring in a big bottle\nof Stimulation For Mind And Body\u2122,\nbut it\u2019s all based around the same drive\nto do something that\u2019s not been done\nyet. And I guess engineers can join in\nthe group hug at that point, too.\nThe people that I really admire in this\nhellhole \u2013 Felix staff aside, for wholly\nseparate reasons \u2013 are those that get a\nkick out of their 9am lectures. There\nare, to my mind, less than ten people\nthat meet that criteria that I know of.\nWhen I sit down with them for a\ndrink in some Chemical Engineering bomb shelter, or lean back in The\nUsual Seat at Starbucks, or sit down at\nWaterloo for a post-traumatic stress\ncoffee, they don\u2019t talk about University\nlike it\u2019s a job, or an extension of their\nschooldays. While they might not all\nadmit it, they talk about it like it\u2019s a\nfundamental reason for getting up in\nthe morning.\nThe honey trap with exams is to hide\nin your shell and revert back to the feverish A-Level student that you used to\nbe, frantically focusing on the material,\nbemoaning every day you tread into\nthe library and celebrating each exam\nthat finishes with a witty Facebook\nstatus update. That\u2019s one of the most\npainless ways to get through it, I\u2019ll admit \u2013 I myself may be taking my semiautomatic and clip-on beard into the\nstreets when this year\u2019s over and fire a\nfew clips into the air, screaming.\nBut don\u2019t make this what Imperial\nis to you. No matter what degree or\ncourse you\u2019re on, you\u2019ll be forced to\ndo something that approaches \u2018real\nresearch\u2019 by the time your final year is\nup here. At that time, you\u2019ll have gone\nfurther than most people in your field,\nand you\u2019ll be looking at something that\nnot many people ever will.\nWhether that makes the exercise\nseem all the more futile to you, or all\nthe more beautiful, depends somewhat\nupon your state of mind. But I know\nthat most of the people I met in my\nFreshers\u2019 week back in <insert some\nrandom year in here, Tomo, just to\nscrew with everyone\u2019s mind> fell firmly\ninto the latter category back then, even\nif they may not now.\nPick up a copy of New Scientist, or\ntake look around the Bad Science blog.\nFlick through the BBC Science page or\nvolunteer to mentor in local schools.\nFly out to Eastern Europe to ask people\nhow they feel about their fields, or ask\nyour personal tutor how their research\nis going. Don\u2019t let your three or four\nyears of being a scientist pass you by.\nDot-to-dot with New Scientist\nLinnearse\nPresenting the footballer\nG\nood tidings to you all\nonce again. The astute\namong you may have\nnoticed my facelift, the\npicture a fortnight ago\nwas in fact a representation of the delightfully rare Finance Tart group. This\nweek we\u2019ll be looking at an equally\ndespicable group of oxygen thieves \u2013\nthe IC Footballers. Here\u2019s one of their\nsemi-literate ilk trying to communicate with us:\nThe Footballer\nFuckin\u2019 WHHAAAY! What am I doing in a place like this \u2013 everyone\u2019s a\nfucking geek/loser. Except me, my\nmates and a few birds I wank over oc-casionally. So what if I\u2019m only a spotty\nyob with three decent A-levels. I\u2019m\nfucking amazing at football. I get into\nsome serious shit on the pitch. We\u2019re\ntalking antagonising other players here\n\u2013 swearwords, weak pushing, the lot. I\nwouldn\u2019t actually fight anyone though,\nI might get hurt!\nAnyway, I should be in a higher team\nbut my one\u2019s a laugh. We have painfully\nforced banter and lightweight drinking\ngames. Which only about 10% of the\nclub actually take part in. I\u2019m going\nto shout homophobic stuff ironically.\nWhy? Cuz that\u2019s how I roll.\nEy up, there\u2019s some birds in the Union?!?! Oh they\u2019re American. They\u2019re\nnot quite as hot as the girls on my hard\ndrive, but they\u2019ll do. I\u2019m getting laid\ntonight\u2026 I\u2019m trying on my best \u2018game\u2019\nwith this one. Hmmm, she\u2019s not instantly impressed with me. Could it be\nbecause my wit\u2019s slower than the service times at Da Vincis? No she\u2019s definitely wanting some. Yeah, all girls are\nalways up for it at all times, that\u2019s what\nmy diet of Nuts, Maxim and hardcore\npornography has taught me. Gay, it\u2019s\nnot happening tonight \u2013 not because\nI\u2019m so socially retarded that I can\u2019t\neven chat up a below-average-looking\nAmerican bird \u2013 NO, because I\u2019m too\nfucking drunk! Fuck it; let\u2019s just get my\nmates to be rude to those dumb Americans \u2013 if we can\u2019t have them, no-one\nelse can! \u201cYeah, you\u2019re ugly AND stupid\u2026hurr huurr!\u201d. They\u2019ll come back\u2026\nOk I\u2019m not getting any action tonight.\nI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m a real man. A man\u2019s\nman. Real men don\u2019t get laid \u2013 they get\npissed on snakebite, act hyper-macho\nand scrawl graffiti on the Union toilets.\nFuck. Yeah.\nI wonder if I could get a job in the\nCity, that would get me the ladies. No,\nno they only employ people who are\ndickheads and have good degrees. I\u2019m\npretty sure I\u2019ve got the former covered.\nGiven up hope about the latter. God\nI\u2019m desperate. Next round of snakey-B\non me lads!\nSnakey-B! Awesome-a-saurus-rexicals-of-super-win\nIn his spare time, A. Geek enjoys reading New Scientist. You should too\n\n"

No. I\u2019d rather\nbe deaf even though I\u2019m a musician.\nHow can I face not being able to see\nhim [Joe] everyday? I\u2019d have to kill\nmyself.\nJoe: I\u2019d be blind.\nHow can you live without music?\nSaul: Easy. You can watch music videos\nwith speech on TV.\nWhat is your favourite takeaway?\nSaul and Joe agreed: Chicken burger\u2026\nFried chicken\u2026Caribbean takeaway.\nThat\u2019s what we are going to go for.\nThe band deep in concentration, engrossed in their toys, fingers doing the talking. That is a helluva dirty camera lens\nWhat\u2019s your most embarrassing\nmoment in life if you don\u2019t mind\nsharing?\nSaul: I was caught doing it with my\ngirlfriend on the sofa and her parents\ncame back and saw us through the\nwindow.\nJoe: We were playing a gig in Skegness\nand I passed out backstage. I was completely out of it, I was wearing a pair\nof gold Elvis glasses and some drunken\nchavs came and put stuff on my head.\nThe video is now on YouTube. It was\npretty embarrassing.\nWhat superpower would you like\nto have?\nSaul: I would like to turn sideways and\ndisappear. I\u2019m getting there, I\u2019m quite\nthin.\nJoe: Mine\u2019s really boring. I would like\nto fly. I have had loads of dreams where\nI\u2019m flying.\nHave you guys ever played pranks\non teachers?\nSaul: Not really pranks man. I once\nthrew a computer at a teacher. An assault not a prank. I would have liked\nto have played pranks but I couldn\u2019t\nhave got away with it. It was too hard.\nI would have liked to put pins on their\nchairs.\nJoe: I set a classroom table on fire once\nwhilst the teacher was in the room. I\nused Tippex to set it on fire.\nDid you get kicked out of school\nthen? Were you troublemakers?\nSaul kisses the microphone whilst a happy chappie laughs away...\nGig review\nThe Metros\nBarfly Camden\nPecknam boys blasting the night away at Barfly\nBarfly Camden, \u2018tis the place to\n\u2018glimpse the stars of the future.\u2019 Helping to launch careers of many stars\nlike Coldplay, Franz Ferdinand and\nBadly Drawn Boy, it\u2019s no surprise\nthat The Metros have chosen this\nspot, having their eyes set on making it to the big time.\nWhilst the night was still young,\nToddla T, from the same record label (1965 Records) as the boys from\nSouth London, hit the stage with his\nfunky dance/elctronics/house mixing and dexterous DJ manoeuvres.\nAt the strike of 10pm, The Metros\nfinally had their showtime after what\nseemed like an eternity in sound\nchecks. Anticipation and excitement\nin the air. That\u2019s what it was. The\ncrowd was buzzing. A sold-out gig at\nBarfly. What more can you expect?\nThe night could not pass without\ngetting entangled in the mosh pit.\nFun. Fun. Fun. If you didn\u2019t mind being catapulted across the room and\nshoved in all angles with beer spilled\ndown your top or bottom.\nFists were pumping, arms flail-ing, hips rolling, spirits were high as\nfans were bowled over by the brazen,\nfeisty performance. Those that knew\nthe songs pretty well sang along joy-ously, those that didn\u2019t, well, we half-sang and simply cheered like crazy.\nMind you, the five knew their stuff and\nthey sounded terrific. If you like The\nLibertines, I think you\u2019ll take a strong\nliking to this bunch from Pecknan as\nthey are wild and wicked in spirit and\nsound. Saul, the lead singer, boy, did he\nknow how to set the place on fire! Both\nhe and the rest of the band exuberated\nenergy, passion and experience beyond their years. Rocking to and fro on\nstage, kings of the castle. Quite some-thing. Just shows one should use youth\nto one\u2019s advantage, i.e. unleashing the\ntorpedo of energy and dynamism while\nwe can before we get burdened and\ntied down with biggies like marriage\nand children. No; we adolescents are\nthe way forward.\nThe vocal delivery was outright cannon fodder. Frontman Saul rocked the\nnight away, retelling cautionary tales of\nteenage life in London with unabated\nzest. With equal doses of enthusiasm,\nthe bassist and guitarists interjected\nreinforcement with harmonious yells\nand shouts. What a downright eu-Saul: I did get kicked out of school.\nYeah, I was a troublemaker.\nHow did you do in school?\nSaul: GCSEs is as far as I got.\nJoe: I\u2019ve got about seven GCSEs. I did a\ncouple months of sixth form and then\nI didn\u2019t go. Didn\u2019t bother to tell them I\nwas leaving. Then I just hung out with\nhim (Saul).\nWhich track are you most proud\nof?\nphonic racket. Now and again on\nstage, you\u2019d see Saul taking a swig\nof the bottle. Fired up by the liquor,\nthe singing got louder and the crowd\nbecame merrier and merrier. Songs\nfuelled by the school system seemed\nto get the crowd\u2019s acknowledgement\nas quite as few were indeed teens\nout on a school night-\u2019Education is\noverrated, and I\u2019m the monster that\nit created.\u2019 References to Pecknam\nto crime and ASBOS are featured in\ntheir songs- \u2018He got in trouble with\nlaw, put in jail \u2018til 2004,\u2019 I think the\nboys know a thing or two about being kicked out of school and causing\nmayhem, having lived with crime on\ntheir doorsteps most of their lives.\nOne must not forget to mention the\ncatchy scaling bass lines, rhythmic\nguitars and upbeat drumming which\ndid do the rest of the talking. The\nMetros finished on a high with their\nsoon to be released single \u2018Education\nPt2\u2019 with the fans singing along tri-umphantly. Everyone was won over\nby the energy that the guys brought\non stage. Strutting and rocking about\nlike nobody\u2019s business.\nThe Metros are certainly a train\nride well worth catching.\nSusan Yu\nSaul: There\u2019s this song called Ra Ra Rolands on our forthcoming album that\nI\u2019m proud of.\nYour new single is about educa-tion. Tell us more about it?\nSaul: I wrote it when I was 16, when I\ngot kicked out of school. It\u2019s going to\nbe released soon, March 17th. Our album is coming out this summer.\nThank you boys\n\n"

They fended off\n15 other teams from Imperial, Cambridge, Oxford and the LSE in the\nfinal and over 400 other people who\nentered the qualifying rounds, to be\ncrowned the best traders in a game of\nquick thinking, speed and accuracy.\nThe competition consisted of two\nrounds; a qualifying round at each of\nthe universities which took place two\nweeks ago and the final round at the\nMerrill Lynch headquarters in London\nlast week. The platform for the trading simulations was designed and run\nby 7city Learning and Merrill Lynch\nkindly sponsored all the events. Merrill Lynch has a very strong network\nof Imperial alumni and recently won\nthe \u201cHere Is The City\u201d award for Best\nPlace to Work in the Global Financial\nMarkets category. 7city Learning is a\nglobal financial services training company providing leading edge solutions\nfor financial and professional skills\ntraining.\nThe competition attracted overwhelming interest at Imperial and\nmore than 100 students across all departments were selected to enter the\nqualifying round. The first round consisted of a US stock trading simulation\nand the goal was simple: to make as\nmuch money as possible in 40 min-utes. The simulation was based on six\nstocks using historical market price\ndata and players competed in teams of\ntwo, buying and selling from a number\nof banks.\nHemal Mehta and Kok Yeen Cheek\nwon the first event and were each\nawarded an iPod Nano. They managed\nto raise a staggering $67 million, far\noutdoing the next best two who made\na profit of $35 million. Four teams of\ntwo qualified for the final round at\nMerrill Lynch, being given the chance\nto compete for a prize of \u00a32000.\nThe final, which took place last\nWednesday, proved to be an even\nmore exciting event. The four teams of\nImperial were taken down to the venue at Merrill Lynch\u2019s offices in London\nand were put head to head with teams\nfrom Oxford, Cambridge and LSE.\nThe simulation for the final was a\nmore complex version of the qualifying round trading game. This time\nteams could trade between each other\nand there were also news feeds. It was\nbased on a bearish European market\nwith much less liquid stocks, making\nit much more difficult to make profits\nand was shown by the fact that only\nthree out of sixteen teams made any\nprofit at all.\nThis made it an even more impressive accomplishment for Tan and Kwa\nwho managed to make \u00a331.4 million\nover the period of an hour when many\nThe Inter-University Trading Game held in the Tanaka Business School\nThe participants\nCome on lads, we can do it!\nAkash Agrawal\nwww.teach\u00derst.org.uk\nDo something different?\nAccelerate yourcareer?\nPut something back?\nInspire a generation?\nChange lives?\nTake a lead?\nWhatever you do,\nTeach First.\nWillyou\u00c9\nAPPLY NOW TO TEACH SCIENCE,\nMATHS OR COMPUTING\nPLACES FILLING UP FAST SO APPLY ASAP!\nFINAL DEADLINE: FRIDAY 28 MARCH\nVISIT WWW.TEACHFIRST.ORG.UK TO APPLY\nteams made just as big a loss.\nThe game was followed by the prize-giving presentation by Christian Dinesen, head of European Credit Research and the captain of recruitment\nfor Imperial who firstly gave a brief\ntalk about the challenges and risks that\ntraders face on a continual basis. After\ncongratulating them on their tremendous achievement, Mr Dinesen awarded Tan Tsze Han and Kwa Wee Shzong\nwith their well deserved trophies. Imperial also placed first in the competition overall by making more than \u00a37\nmillion in total, before Oxford (\u00a34M),\nCambridge (-\u00a34M) and LSE (-\u00a313.6M)\nWe must all praise the teams for representing Imperial in beating Oxford,\nCambridge and the LSE and hope Tsze\nHan and Wee Shzong have fun spending their winnings!\n\n"

Imperial have been\non superb form, comfortably beating their last two opponents, scoring\nover 49 points in each game, whilst the\nMedicals have had to fight hard to earn\ntheir wins.\nThe crowd began to gather at Richmond Rugby Ground from about 6.30\np.m., easily filling the main stand, as\nwell as the side of the pitch which resulted in a crowd of nearly 1,100! They\nwere expecting a hard fought battle,\nthey were expecting blood and tears\non the pitch, they were expecting the\ngame to go down to the wire. They\nwere not going to be disappointed.\nAfter the formalities were completed\nthe game kicked off under the bright\nlights on a clear, still night in south\nwest London. As ever, the opening\nminutes proved to be a frantic affair as\nboth sides came out fired up; however,\nneither team was able to gain the upper hand. With this fast pace and huge\nrivalry between the two sides, discipline was a bit poor to begin with, with\nboth sides conceding penalties. The\nMedicals were afforded the first opportunity to open the scoring but fly-half Dan Neville\u2019s penalty went wide of\nthe left upright. The IC kicker Alexander Johnstone, who unusually was also\ntheir hooker, was also to miss his first\neffort at goal as the game remained\nscoreless early on.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\n& Jeremy Bartosiak-Jentys\n3.

The Medicals set up a\ncatch and drive from the lineout, five\nmetres from the Imperial try line, yet\nImperial were more than ready for\nthem and pushed them back a good few\nmetres before the ball was distributed\nto the backs who were unable to score.\nImperial, on the other hand, attempted\nto exploit the Medicals\u2019 weaker back\nline, running great attacking lines, but\nthe Medicals predicted this and their\ndefence was superb. With neither side\nbeing able to penetrate the line effec-tively, only errors kept the score board\nticking with a further two penalties,\nleaving the score at half-time 6 \u2013 6.\nThe Medicals, who have always considered themselves to be the superior\nteam, seemed shaken by their first half\nperformance. Imperial were full of\nhope after seeing how much their performance had affected the opposition\nand they knew that the start of the second half was going to be tough. This\nwas indeed the case as the Medicals\ncame out with all guns blazing, thirsty\nfor a try, eager to take the lead and reiterate the fact that they considered\nthemselves to be the better team.\nBoth Medical centres James Sharples and Ben Davies carried well and\nran hard lines at the Imperial defence\nwhich gave wingers Harry Thompson and Kevin Ilo space out wide. The\nMedicals\u2019 pressure was to tell as a quick\nball on the right wing was passed along\nthe line to Huw Williams who entered\nthe line from full-back. Ignoring the\nunmarked Harry Thompson outside\nhim Williams went for the line and was\nable to dive over and touch down despite the close attention of the Imperial\ncover tacklers. Neville was unable to\nadd the conversion from near the left\ntouchline which left the score at 11 \u2013 6\nto the Medicals, but about five minutes\nlater they were awarded with a penalty\nto stretch the lead to 14 \u2013 6.\nImperial, having sat through the\nstorm, came out the other side ready\nto really show what they are capable of.\nIn broken and open play the Imperial\nbacks are deadly, whilst the Medicals\nwere strong in the tight; the aim was\nsimple, keep the ball away from their\nforwards and break up their backs. Imperial scrum half, Freddie Chalk and\nfly-half Jo Brown were on great form,\nboth marshalling the backs and forwards as a unit which eventually led\nto a penalty, which was converted. Imperial kept on pushing, gaps were being created at every opportunity that\nstretched and tested the Medicals\u2019 de-fence; however, it could not withstand\nthe push by Imperial and eventualy\nImperial\u2019s first try was scored by centre\nTom Carroll to level the game again.\nImperial were not going to let this run\nof good form slip and the pressure was\nmaintained on the Medicals\u2019 backs;\nhowever, the line-outs were proving to\nbe a bit of a problem with the Medicals\u2019\nsecond row Rob Anderson consistently\nbeing a nuisance to the Imperial line-out.\nThe Medicals did have chances of\ntheir own and tried to break down the\nwing with Kevin Ilo, only to be stopped\nin spectacular style by Imperial\u2019s captain Andrew Jasudasen and vice-cap-tain Flannan O\u2019Mahney. With three\nminutes to go on the clock, Imperial\nspotted a gap in the Medicals\u2019 defence\nand fly-half Jo Brown chipped the ball\nover for Alex Johnstone to catch and\nscore. Imperial were in the lead 19\n\u2013 14.\nWith minutes to go, all Imperial had\nto do was defend their line as they\nknew that the Medicals were going to\ncome at them, and they did, however\nafter ten minutes the game was still going and the Medicals exploited a gap\non the blind side with Rob Anderson,\nscoring the life-saving try. The full-time whistle blew and the score was\n19 \u2013 19 and for the first time ever, the\ngame went into extra time. Both sides\nhad 20 minutes to make their mark, but\nwith discipline still being a problem between the two sides, and the fact that\nthe players were getting tired, penalties\nwere being awarded all over the pitch.\nIt were the Medicals who were able to\nget one within kicking distance and\ntook the lead at 22 \u2013 19, but no matter\nhow much the Imperial boys kept trying to get to their line, they couldn\u2019t get\nMedicals scrape to victory\na penalty within kicking distance and\nas the full time whistle blew the Medicals were relieved whilst the Imperial\nside were left wondering how they let\nit slip at the last moment.\nJPR Williams himself commented after the game that the Medicals should\nconsider themselves very very lucky to\nhave won the game, which means a lot\nsince the former Wales and British Lions full-back is a Medicals Old Boy. He\ncommended the Imperial players and\nespecially Man of the Match Alexander Johnstone of whom he said: \u201cThis\nboy can score tries, kick conversions\nand penalties, and make big hits, all\nwhilst being a hooker as well!\u201d\nWith both sides now in the Premiership, next year\u2019s encounter promises to\nbe a spectacle not to be missed. The\nMedicals received one hell of a wake-up call from Imperial; these games are\nno longer a walk in the park for them,\nand both sides have to put in everything they have to come out the vic-tors.

    "content": "30 felix Friday 14 March 2008\nOrganic what in my TV?\nRichard Lai talks about how this new screen tech will make a difference to you\nA\npologies for the lack of a\nsection of last week but I\nwas enjoying myself with\ncoursework too much to\ntear myself away from it.\nAnyway, let\u2019s see what is on offer from\nthe world of tech as we head towards\nthe end of term.\nThe games console accessory maker\nNyko has beat Sony to the release of\na rumbling Playstation 3 controller\ndubbed the Zero PS3. Sony can\u2019t be too\nhappy about this as they finally gave in\nto consumer pressure to release the\nDual Shock 3 only to be beaten to the\npost. But in reality, I don\u2019t think Sony\nhave to much to worry about as the\nNyko is a flat-out fugly product so I\nthink very few people will stray from\nthe official controller.\nA western state of Germany has recalled its subsidies to Nokia after its\nfailure to meet the conditions set in\nthe agreement. The money was to help\nfund Nokia\u2019s manufacturing plant to\nconstructed in Germany and was supposed to provide 2,800 jobs to the area,\nhowever, Nokia plans to close the plant\nin the next few months much to the annoyance of the people who have paid\nfor it. They have requested the initial\nmoney back plus interest producing a\nsum of \u20ac59 million which if not paid\nwill be replaced with legal action.\nA bunch of clever hackers have pro-ducedamethodofconvertingstreamed\nBBC iPlayer media into the H.264 format required by the iPhone and iTouch\nas they do not support the widely popularized lite media format Flash. Steve\nJobs explained this as \u201cFlash is not up\nto the standard of the iPhone\u201d roughly\ntranslated as \u201cThe iPhone can\u2019t run\nFlash very well\u201d; where the blame falls\nI think we can decide for ourselves.\nAdmittedly, these hackers seem to\nhave wasted their time as an iPlayer for\nthese devices has been in the works for\na while now.\nAmerica and Germany have drawn\nup an agreement to merge each of their\nbiometric criminal databases in an attempt to catch international criminals\nand terrorists. Once again the two\nstandard sides to the argument emerge,\ninvasion of national privacy against\n\u201cscrew them they\u2019re criminals\u201d. In relation to this, rumours have appeared of\na worldwide database being constructed but nothing firm is available.\nThe Nokia N96 mobile has been confirmed for August. This phone is anticipated by many a UK user as it will\nbe the first mobile to have a TV tuner\nbuilt in. For more depth you can find a\npreview of it in a previous issue of the\ntech section on the Felix web page.\nBattlefield laser guns have come a\nstep closer to reality as Northrop, the\nUS military\u2019s main tech supplier, have\ntested a 15 kilowatt laser and have\nplans for a 100 kilowatt model deemed\npowerful for combat. These weapons\nare originally being intended for use\nas anti-missile and anti-air rather than\nground-to-ground as air targets tend\nto be more vulnerable.\nUnfortunately only one article this\nweek, the final issue of term, but needless to say it\u2019s a good one covering the\nevolving new technology of Organic\nLED displays.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 James Finnerty\nHeadlines we\ncouldn\u2019t fit in\nMacbook Air\nsuffers from\noverheating\nSun/Microsoft\ndata centre\nplanned\nNew eclipse to be\nreleased by Sun\nDigital Radio a\nflop\nWiki creator edits\ncontent for cash\nEurope Xbox 360\nprice drop\nSpace freighter\nsuccess\nSouth Korea\nannounces first\nastronaut\nCamera that looks\nthrough clothing\nJames Finnerty\nTechnology Editor\nOLED \u2013 So impressive it overloads people\u2019s ability to construct a facial expression... honestly\niPod nano sparks\nproblems\nMOD loses 11,000\nID cards\nN\now that the HD video\nformat war is over (well\ndone, Sony!), it is probably time to think about\nnext-gen TV. Currently\nit is predicted that this year LCD TVs\nwill net 50% share of the TV market\n(in which 58% will be full HD), but\nthis does not stop the development of\nany new display technologies. As we\nspeak, the most promising candidate\nappears to be the organic light-emit-ting diode (OLED) display technology.\nHere is a brief introduction of OLED:\nas far back as the 1970s, Eastman Kodak discovered that certain organic\nmaterials glow in response to electrical currents, and a variety of related\ntechnologies emerged from that point\nonwards. In fact, our very own Professor Donal Bradley, Head of the Department of Physics, was one of the inventors of the polymer LEDs (PLEDs) \u2013 a\ntype of OLED technology, and today\nwe are able to apply that to display\napplications. Although the finished\nOLED panel may look similar to an\nLCD, the structure differs: from top\nto bottom we have the cathode, emissive polymer layer, conductive polymer\nlayer and anode, with the entire structure laid on a substrate such as glass or\neven plastic. To operate, a current is\npassed between the electrodes, which\ncauses the electrons in the conductive\nlayer to move down to the anode. This\nleaves holes (absence of electrons) behind which then recombine with the\nelectrons in the emissive layer above,\ncausing a drop in the electron energy\nlevels and thus releasing energy in the\nform of light (through the substrate).\nSuch process is known as electrophos-phorescence, as used in all LEDs.\nComparing this with LCDs, OLEDs\nalready have several advantages: as\nmentioned above, each OLED pixel\ncontrols its own light and can therefore\nproduce true black thus boosting the\ncontrast ratio, but LCDs \u2013 which work\nby blocking light in selective areas \u2013\nrequire a backlight across the panel,\nmeaning they cannot show true black\nas some light is bound to leak through.\nAs well as wasting power and making\nthe panel thicker; another difference\nis that an LCD requires two polarisers\nand a colour filter to operate, thereby\nrestricting the viewing angle as well\nas blocking light and increasing thick-ness, whereas an OLED needs no filtering so it has none of those problems.\nOther advantages of the OLEDs include faster refresh rate, greater colour\nrange, longer lifespan (as promised by\nPanasonic and Toshiba last January)\nand \u2013 perhaps most important of all\n\u2013 the ability to be printed onto flexible\nsubstrates, allowing applications that\nare not possible with LCDs.\nCurrently the biggest problems with\nOLEDs is their manufacturing meth-ods: with Eastman Kodak holding the\npatents other companies are financially\nrestricted for development, so even the\ngiants like Sony and Toshiba will have\nto increase the prices to make up for\nthe initial expenses. More worryingly,\nthe fact that the organic materials can\nbe easily damaged by water makes it\nhard to justify the prices, as well as\nputting doubts into the practicality of\nflexible OLEDs, but we can assume\nthat advanced sealing processes will\nbe used \u2013 after all, we are in the 21st\ncentury.\nAs we speak, the only OLED TV in\nthe market is the Sony XEL-1, costing you about \u00a3950 in Japan or about\n\u00a31270 in the US (we all know that the\nJapanese keep the best to themselves).\nAnd no, it\u2019s not even an HDTV or a\n40\u201d; a mere little 11\u201d baby that gives\nyou 3mm of sexiness and a ridiculous\ncontrast ratio of 1,000,000:1 (most\nLCD TVs in this price range can only\ndo about 10,000:1). It really isn\u2019t the\nsize, mate, but only if you can afford\nit. Fortunately, you can experience the\nOLED goodness in smaller forms without burning holes in your pocket: since\nOLEDs have a much simpler structure\nthan LCDs, they are ideal for making\nsmall displays, so you will find them\nin several new (pricey) digital camer-as, premium mobile phones, or some\nnew portable media players such as the\nCreative Zen stone. If you don\u2019t mind\nmonochrome displays, selected design\nwatches will also have OLED panels \u2013\nyou can spot them straight away with\ntheir distinctively vibrant colours.\nBut this isn\u2019t it; the list of potential\napplications goes on: rollable electronic newspaper that updates itself\ndaily with newspapers, animated artwork (or even TV) on clothes, head-mounted display system for soldiers,\nlight sources--, etc. For now, OLEDs\nmay still be occupying a small part of\nthe TV and monitor market, but as\nnew production processes emerge and\nbreakthroughs breakthrough they will\nbecome more affordable \u2013 I don\u2019t see\nwhy this can\u2019t happen within 5 years\u2019\ntime. It will also be interesting to see if\nOLEDs can exceed LCDs\u2019 performance\nby then \u2013 mind you, it did take about\n30 years for LCDs to occupy more than\nhalf the TV market!\nOLED on your wrist!\n\n"

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n24 felix Friday 14 March 2008\nFilm\nFilm Editor \u2013 Alex Casey\nGeorge Romero: Diarist of the dead\nin satire. Sheepish horde psychology is\nalso at the forefront of this film, doubled by Romero\u2019s usual intricacies on\nthe human nature and its reflection on\nthe social self in the context of despair\nand the unknown.\nMost naturally, the following entrance in the Dead series was called\nDay of the Dead and it took Romero\nanother eight years before releasing it.\nIt was a bit of a change in atmosphere\nfrom the previous two outings, as the\nstory revolved around a military bunker with army men and scientists, encircled by hordes of undead yearning\nfor their flesh.\nThe story revolves mostly around an\nundead,namedBob,whomthemilitary\nhad captured and were trying to edu-cate. The movie dims the line between\nthe two \u201cantagonistic groups\u201d (human\nand undead), questioning whether\nthere are any fundamental differences\nbetween their natures, in a sordid tale\nof morality and army mentality.\nLand of the Dead, which appeared in\n2005, twenty years since Day, seems to\nemphasize variation rather than originality within the series, but it manages\nto literally raise it from the dead. This\nouting is the logical step forward from\nits predecessor, portraying a world of\nsevere disparity, in which a two-lay-ered society survives encapsulated in\nthe remains of Pittsburgh, while the\nundead have taken over the world. A\nspecial salvage vehicle is being used to\nretrieve useful items from outside the\n\u201csafe zone\u201d, in order to keep life running on a day-to-day basis.\nHowever, the more interesting bit of\nthe film develops outside the containment area, where the undead slowly\nbut surely develop a sense of social\ntogetherness, under the leadership of\na pretty commanding \u201cboss\u201d, who ultimately finds a way to penetrate the\ndefence system set up by the humans\nand wreak havoc. Despite Romero\u2019s\ngood intentions and fine execution, it\u2019s\nmuch harder for Land of the Dead to\nstand out, in this oversaturated age of\nzombie films, which have been blandly\nrehashing the same ideas and concepts\nWith his second film in three years, director George A. Romero would seem to be quickening the pace\ngiven his less than prolific previous output. Felix decides to have a retrospective to prove less can be more\nStefan Carpanu\nfor years now \u2013 with the odd successful exceptions, such as the obvious 28\nDays Later.\nFunnily enough, both Land and Day,\nwhich had to bear more criticism than\nthe previous films, were high-budget\nfilms compared to these, having cost\nsixteen million and three and a half\nmillion respectively, as opposed to the\none hundred thousand spent on Night\nand five hundred thousand spent on\nDawn(inflationnotwithstanding).This\nmonth has seen another Dead film roll\nout on the UK screens, entitled Diary\nof the Dead. Shot in a blair witchian/\ncloverfieldian manner in just over\nthree weeks, it represents a return to\nhis roots for Romero. The film tells the\ntale of a group of students who, while\nproducing a horror movie of their own,\ncome across the real deal. It does seem,\nthough, that Romero is trying to remind us of all the things he\u2019s said and\ndone along the years, encompassing\nmost of them in this latest film, thereby\nsacrificing much of its potential original feel. At certain points it seems a lot\nlike he\u2019s parodying himself. Still, there\nare interesting bits and good pieces\nin this Diary, although it\u2019s hard to say\nwhether you\u2019ll really feel it\u2019s worth it. I\nsuppose it comes down to how much\nthe undead mean to you.\nWhatever may be said, though, of\nthese last two or three films in the se-ries, it in no way diminishes the artistic\nand cultural impact of Romero\u2019s earlier work. Ironically, his first two Dead\nfilms, which came to define a serious\nchunk of the horror genre, have not\naged very well, working no longer as\nhorror films in the present day \u2013 the\nsad consequence of technological ad-vances, which affect horror and sci-fi\nfilms more than other genres. Beyond\nthis however, Romero\u2019s legacy stands\nstrong.\nIf its endurance alone isn\u2019t proof\nenough for the relevance of the series,\nthen surely the innumerable remakes,\nspin-offs and parodies show how rich a\nsource it has proven along the decades:\nNight was remade in 1990 and again in\n2006, Dawn was remade in 2004 and\nthe Day remake is currently in the\nworks. Films such as the prolific Return\nof the Living Dead series, Shaun of the\nDead or the more recent Fido parodied\nRomero\u2019s Dead to different degrees of\nsuccess, as did a bunch of many other\nsimilarly-minded flicks.\nMoreover, it seems that Diary of\nthe Dead already has a sequel in the\nworks, proof of the fact that Romero\nnever seems to get old in his zealous\nadventures within the world of the un-dead. As opposed to other horror cult\nfigures (Wes Craven to name one), it is\nremarkable that Romero can still carry\nthe battle with time and society in a\ndignified manner, sacrificing no more\nthan is necessary in terms of quality in\nhis works of horror, even if the \u201cundead\nrevolution\u201d has long gone. It\u2019s amusing\nto think of how someone could ever\ndifferentiate between \u201ca zombie\u201d and\n\u201can undead\u201d, but that is exactly what\nRomero achieved by instilling meaning\nand purpose into an otherwise utterly\ncommercial genre.\nWhile the success garnered beyond\nthe Dead series was little, he shall undoubtedly remain one of the few real\nMasters of Horror \u2013 the kind of horror which is more than gore and guts,\nmore than an amateurish TV Series,\nmore than a money-making machine;\nand yet a little of each of these.\nIt\u2019s actually quite ironic that the first\n\u2018returning dead\u2019 movie I ever saw was\na parody of the genre. When I reached\nthe exciting age of ten, a friend tempted\nme to watch Return of the Living Dead,\nand while I didn\u2019t give in to temptation,\nI gave in to my then over-inflated ego,\nwhich had been rattled in its cage of\nreputability.\nThe sheer horror! For almost half a\ndecade I didn\u2019t want to have anything to\ndo with the living dead (not that I\u2019d be\noverexcited about it at this point in my\nlife). Only once I had stopped thinking\neach night of how far the graveyards\nwere from wherever I happened to be\nspending the hours after dusk did my\ninterest in re-experiencing \u2018the undead\u2019 start reviving itself, and, like any\nrevival, it went deep and cleansed me\nof all my fears \u2013 replacing it with plain,\ngood old passionate despair.\nThis madness all started forty years\nago, in 1968, with the release of George\nA. Romero\u2019s Night of the Living Dead.\nA critique of the American war in Vietnam, the film told the story of a small\ngroup of people who retreat to a cottage over night, as the dead come to life\nin a most bizarre, sinister and unex-plainable event. The fight for survival\nand the tension between the protagonists are portrayed with cinematic flair\nby the then first-timer Romero, but it\nis the underlying connotations and its\nenormous cultural impact which have\ntransformed this film into a milestone\nof the horror genre, not to mention\nhow it had the same effect on many\npeople that RotLD had on me \u2013 a bit\nweird, looking at it from the present.\nThe second film in the series, Dawn\nof the Dead saw the light of day ten\nyears later. Arguably more popular\nthan the first, Dawn criticized the\nsurge of consumerism, as the United\nStates had become a showcase for the\nconsumption-driven society. This time\naround, another group of people barricades itself in a shopping mall, as the\ndead have gone rampant again, in what\nproves to be, above all, a great exercise\nMmm, tastes like chicken\n\n"

We\u2019ve raised\naround \u00a36000 depending on the donations made tonight, and that\u2019s the\nmost important thing. I thought it was\namazing, and I loved every single second of it.

SO we wanted to tie the music in as well. There was\nthe whole ethical thing as well, which\nbrings in the global aspect of it all, and\nthe disco brings the music side.\nFelix: Ethical fashion has been\nhighlighted in exhibitions in\nrecent times, did you feel it was\nimportant to showcase the ethical walk this year?\nAlice: Yeh definitely. Its something\nthat\u2019s been big in the media at the moment and we thought this would be a\ngood opportunity to show people that\nethical didn\u2019t mean boring. . The stuff\nlooked really beautiful, and places like\nAdilli that lent us the clothes do beautiful clothes that are ethically produced.\nI think it was really good place to send\nthat message home.\nFelix: Do you think ethical fashion\nis the future of fashion?\nAlice: I\u2019d like to think so, yeh. I mean\nmore and more places and becoming\nlike that, lots of places have their own\nethical lines and I hope to see that in-creasing. So yeh, hopefully it is the future of fashion.\nFelix: Are there any other messages you want people to take\nfrom the show tonight?\nAlice: A good combination of everyone\nhaving a really awesome night, but we\nwanted to show them what a fashion\nshow can be like; it can be fun and not\njust everyone poncing around.\nOur congratulations go to Alice\nand Josh for such a well-organ-ised and successful evening, They\nnow go back to finishing their\nmedical degrees from Imperial.\nGood luck.\nFashion can be fun; it\u2019s not just poncing around\nDaniel Wan gets wasted on mango-based cocktails, and chats with Fashion Show co-chair, Alice Johnston\n\n"

    "content": "Netball\n1sts team netball battle it out to the bitter end\nMedics just squeeze past IC ladies 2nd\nAfter some intense discussion the day\nbefore about team plans and tactics the\nImperial Netball 1st team finally had\ntheir team sorted out. With the loss of\nour 1st team GS through injury in the\nBUSA Cup match the week before, the\ngirls were nervous about how the new\narrangement would perform. However, after a good warm up the girls in\nblue took to the court for the biggest\nrivalry game of their season against the\nIC Medics.\nThe first whistle blew and the game\nbegan. Throughout the first quarter\nIC showed great control, and although\nthe game was slow the girls were working hard to stay composed and not to\nthrow the ball away. Some excellent\ninterceptions by the defence,and great\nshooting from the attack left the Imperial ladies up by four goals at the end of\nthe first quarter.\nThe second quarter was much like\nthe first with the shooters in both\nteams never missing a shot and the\ncentre court players refusing to make\na mistake which could cost them an in-terception. The defence battled hard at\nboth ends, trying to capitalise on any\ndropped balls or inaccurate passes, but\nthere were few opportunities and by\nthe end of the first half the score was\n17-19 to the Medics.\nWith some small changes to the attack in the third quarter, both teams\npicked up the pace of the game and\nmistakes started to show through lack\nof concentration and over-excitement.\nThe roar of the supporters was deafening and the atmosphere grew and grew\nwithin the sports hall as the Medics\nslowly pulled ahead of the Imperial\ngirls. They continued to work hard and\nmade up to their previous mistakes\nin the game through interceptions;\nhowever, the IC medics defence made\nsome great interceptions and by the\nend of the third quarter the Imperial\nladies were down 25-29, leaving it all\nup to the last quarter.\nThe IC girls showed great deter-mination, continuing to never miss a\nshot and coming very close to inter-ceptions. It was an agonising quarter\nto watch with the girls in blue being\ntwelve goals down at one point in the\nquarter. Through the defence and attack they were able to bring it back to\ntwo and with only 3 minutes to go, with\nthe crowd of supporters cheering both\nteams, the Medics pulled ahead again\nby two goals leaving the final score at\nthe whistle as 38-42.\nOn behalf of the team I would like to\nthank all the supporters that came to\nwatch the game, the umpires and scor-ers, and the IC Medics for a great game.\nI would also like to say how proud I am\nof the team and the way they played\nthroughout the game; although it was\nnot the result some were hoping for, it\nwas a great achievement and I couldn\u2019t\nhave asked any more of you all.\nIt has been an amazing season for us\nand I would like to say that those of you\nthat are leaving us this year (you know\nwho you are) will be greatly missed and\nyour contributions to the club have\nbeen amazing and it will not be the\nsame without you!\nAfter an interesting season which saw\nthe Imperial Netball 2nds firstly lose\ntheir GS to the 1st team which resulted\nin having to take the 3rd team shooter,\nthey then lost their captain who had to\npull out due to work commitments \u2026\nand all this with a team that is made up\nprimarily of freshers!\nAnd so, the annual clash arrived\nand all was set for the IC 2nd team to\nplay the Medics 2nds. After losing by\nonly one goal earlier in the season, we\nknew it would be a tight match. From\nthe outset it was close, with a neck and\nneck score at the end of the first three\nquarters (16-16).\nDuring the fourth quarter the victory\ncould have gone to either team, but unfortunately the Medics pulled away to\na two-goal lead in the last few minutes.\nThe final score was 24-22 to the Imperial Medics.\nA special congratulation should go\nto Anna Haslop (GS) for her consistent and accurate shooting. A mention\nshould also go to Jakie Fok who was\nawarded twat of the match for nearly\ndoing the splits in a spectacular slide,\nthank you to Ethos for over-polishing\nthe floor, made play so much easier!\nSo, after a tightly fought match, we\nJess Marley\nNetball\nVarsity\nImperial 1st 38\nMedicals 1st 42\nCarolyn Sharpe\nNetball\nVarsity\nImperial 2nd 22\nMedicals 2nd 24\nWell\u2026\nwhat a\nseason\nand it\u2019s\nvery\nnearly\nall over!\nThe 1st\nteam\nwon\ntheir\nBUSA league unbeaten and\nhas been promoted \u2013 CONGRATULATIONS GIRLS!\nThe 2s have played well all\nseason and were unlucky in\nBUSA, but still have a chance\nto win their ULU league and\nbe promoted \u2013 Come on,\ngirls! The 3s have had some\ninteresting games and results\nwith a higgledy-piggledy\nteam, but have had lots of\nnetballing fun at the same\ntime.\nAs a club, we\u2019ve had way\ntoo much fun dressed as cats,\nhorrible things for Halloween,\nthe Nativity (legendary), and\ncheerleaders. We\u2019ve even\n\u201corganized\u201d a Valentine\u2019s Pub\nCrawl, which went from the\nUnion Bar to DaVinci\u2019s and\nback again \u2013 whoops! And in\ndoing all this, we\u2019ve created\nfar too much gossip for even\nme to handle!\nThis year\u2019s Varsity was the\nmost intense that I\u2019ve been\ninvolved in. The hype leading\nup to the day was almost un-bearable. The gym has been\npacked every lunchtime since\nChristmas with competitors\nfrom various sports (one in\nparticular, they know who\nthey are!) trying to reach the\npeak of fitness at the right\ntime.\nI got up that morning feeling\nphysically sick, I even struggled to eat \u2013 which is very\nunlike me \u2013 all day. It seems\nstrange that a game with only\npride at stake can affect you in\nthat way. But that is the beauty of Varsity, one day where a\nfew games of sport matter to\n1000s of people who usually\njust don\u2019t give a damn!!\nAlthough the results at Varsity didn\u2019t go our way and left\nus heartbroken (especially\nme!), I just want to say how\nproud I am of every single\nmember of my club for the\npassion they showed on\ncourt and their dignified conduct off court on the day.\nThese last two years as\nNetball Club Captain have\nbeen out of this world (al-most literally some Wednesday nights!), and I want to\nthank everyone who has both\nhelped and supported me in\nthis time \u2013 you know who you\nare!\nAnd I love you all girlies \u2013\neven if you can be a pain in\nthe ass sometimes! x x x\nJess Marley\nCaptain\u2019s Corner\nlook forward to not only seeing you\nagain at Varsity next year, but in the\nBUSA league as well.\nThe wing defender is not letting the medic get her hands on that ball\nI couldn\u2019t find the next shot, so I\u2019m not sure if it actually went in\n10 Varsity Special\n\n"

Other highlights\nof the year include the Men\u2019s\n4th XI being promoted out of\nthe bottom ULU league and\nthe Men\u2019s 3rd XI narrowly\nmissing out on promotion in\nboth ULU and BUSA.\nWe hope to see you all at\nPresidents Day 2008\nJack Cornish\nCaptain\u2019s Corner\nOwen Connick\nHockey\nVarsity\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 2p\nMedicals Men\u2019s 1st 2\nWith all the other IC teams playing\ntheir Varsity games on Wednesday\nthe Mens 1st team felt more than a little left out. Due to national BUSA cup\ncommitments up north in Sheffield it\nwas all we could do to make it back in\ntime for the rugby at Richmond.\nA good dose of Medic abuse therein\nand a very strong run of games in the\nBUSA cup meant that on arrival at\nChiswick, IC were in confident mood.\nThis game was to be played as a dou-ble-header with the victors taking not\nonly the Varsity crown but also the\nULU Challenge cup trophy to boot. In\nfact, IC had three teams representing\nin cup final games.\nThe Mens 2s wrapped up their tie first\ndespite the best efforts of Mrs. Fat-nSlow and her husband umpiring. The\nLadies 1st had a much harder time\nof it but made an excellent showing,\neventually losing out narrowly to GKT\nin their cup final. Any disappointed\nfaces were soon buoyed by Roxy who\nbrought iced sponge cake and smiles\naplenty.\nAnd so back to our game. Usual\nscene, really, IC were incredibly awesome with magical skill, eagle-eyed vi-sion, and masterful composure in pos-session. The medics cheated, fouled,\nand scabbed their way back from 2-0\ndown to draw level at 2-2 just minutes\nbefore the final whistle blew. Moments\nof note include Cornish crying off to\nthe bench because he was knackered,\nPhoetus trying to take off by swinging\nhis stick around above his head helicopter style and nice-boy of nice-boys\nNick Jones getting sin-binned twice in\none match. Watch out, ladies, he likes\nto get down on the turf and swing his\ntackle from behind. Dirty.\nAnd so it went to a penalty shoot-out.\nMost went in, some missed, Joe didn\u2019t\nreally try. Sach livened it up by sauntering up to the spot, waving kisses to\nthe crowd, and then he decided that he\ndidn\u2019t even need to take his flick and\nwalked back. It even went to sudden\ndeath p-flicks. I don\u2019t even know how\nbecause we really were leagues above\nthe Medics but we just sort of played\nthem along for a while; it\u2019s good sport\nyou know. Alex momentarily parted\nhimself from his picnic basket and\nwith all the cheek of a young chimpanzee he pointed to the exact place where\nhe was to fire home his flick. Too easy.\nSo then they missed, Crusty scored,\nand we won.\nWe collected our cup, our women,\nand the medic\u2019s pride and got back on\nthe coach to the half-price curry house.\nIt\u2019s really half price you know.\nHarry Marshall\nHockey\nVarsity\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nMedicals Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nThe seemingly drab scoreline hides\nwhat was probably one of the most\nexciting Varsity matches. There was\na brief delay to the start whilst a ram-bling, crazed man, inexplicably dressed\n(badly) as a golden chicken, was removed from the pitch. Once the poultry was cleared the game could begin\n\u2013 and what a game!\nThe first half was tight. Nugget, having provided some excellent pre-match\nbanter with the aid of a traffic cone, was\ndefending solidly. He was ably assisted\nby Oedipus and Cheeky both playing\nout of position at defensive centre-mid\nyet admirably filling Superpiss\u2019s shoes.\nChances were being created at either\nend with Dyke and Lovechild combing\nparticularly well down the right wing\nfor IC.\nIn goal Biggsy, having just returned\nfrom a broken back after his parachute\ndidn\u2019t open sky-diving (no joke), was\non fire. It was still 0-0 at half-time\nand the crowd was only getting big-ger, more drunken and louder. Keeno\nhad finally arrived to provide extra\nfirepower upfront. Surely a goal must\ncome from somewhere?\nThe second half was even more frenetic as both sides searched for a goal.\nThe Beast started making some frighteningly forward yet effective runs from\nleft-back, linking well with Guff. They\nwere creating chances, as were Dyke\nand Lovechild down the right. HeShe\nand Blob were providing great link\nup play between midfield and attack\nand Blob and Refugee both had great\nchances.\nHowever the medic\u2019s keeper was\nhaving as miraculous a game as Biggsy\nwhose only balls-up was redeemed\nwith the season\u2019s wunder save.\nThere were goalmouth scrambles at\nboth ends with balls dribbling agonis-ingly wide and being swept off the line.\nThe last five minutes were manic with\ntwo crazed sets of supporters screaming every time the ball moved vaguely\nin the direction of the opposition goal.\nHowever, in the end no amount of running from Refugee (and there was a\nlot) could produce a goal and the IC\ndefence remained solid \u2013 even old man\nFeatherlite broke a sweat. Ultimately,\nthe result ensured IC retained the Varsity hockey trophy. Job done!\n4 Varsity Special\nMen\u2019s 2nd teams competing for the ball\n\n"

The last thing you think of is\ngood ol\u2019 London Town! This was the\nexact reaction of the Student Windsurfing Association (SWA) Committee when the idea of Imperial College\nWindsurfers hosting an SWA Event\nwas proposed in December last year.\nHowever, after discussing the logistics\nof such an event, it became apparent that this crazy idea would actually\nwork and on the 29th February 2008,\nthe SWA came to London for the first\never SWA London Event.\nOver 100 student windsurfers from\nuniversities around the country gathered in DB\u2019s on the Friday night and\nhaving battled the Friday night traffic from places as far afield as Cardiff\nand York, most were desperate for a\ndrink.

The event was shaping\nup to be a good one!\nSaturday was the first day of competition and as everyone arrived at Datchet Water, a large reservoir on the outskirts of London with a fantastic view\nover Windsor Castle, they were greeted by an amazing sight... The sun was\nshining and wind was blowing a good\n20 knots making it perfect for running\nthe 3rd round of the SWA Boardwise\nFreestyle Series. This was the toughest\nfleet of the series so far and even the\njudges commented that this was the\nhighest standard they had ever seen in\nSWA competition.

Quarter time score,\n8-8. As the tension grew in the second quarter the Medics pushed ahead,\nleaving the Imperial team wanting it\neven more. The score was 12-17 at half\ntime. Hopefully some half-time oranges would help.\nBut then in an attempt to score a\nmarvellous goal, the Imperial Goal\nShooter, Fee Larner fell valiantly to\nthe floor with cramp leaving the Medics once again proving they know less\nabout medicine than a media student\nat Bradford!\nUnfortunately for Imperial the goals\njust weren\u2019t going in and the Medics\nbegan to greatly increase the goal difference in the third quarter, leaving\nthe scores at 14-28 with 15 minutes\nto play. This made the Imperial team\nmore determined than ever so entering\nthe final quarter, a little red in the face,\nthey began to win their centres back. It\nwas too late though as the Medics had\nalready stormed ahead.\nFinally, the buzzer went, leaving the\nscores at 17-34!

You could feel the excitement as supporters from the other\nteams started to pile in. We wanted\nto get the game started ASAP so that\nall the games could finish earlier and\nthen we could all get to Richmond on\ntime. However, the Medics were having none of it.\nEventually, the game got underway\nwith competitive debuts for Amrita\nRandhawa, Sarah Jane, and Tina Flanagan. In the first quarter, the shooting looked a bit rusty for both teams,\nwhich left the scores 3-3 at the quarter-time whistle. With some outstanding\ninter-play between centre Fee Larner,\nWA Amrita, and GA Charlotte Graham, IC had just pulled ahead by half\ntime \u2013 the score 6-5. The third quarter didn\u2019t quite go to plan with IC only\nscoring one goal. Maybe it was all the\noranges we ate at half time \u2013 left our\nhands a bit juicy! The score was 7-10\nwith 10 minutes to play. Unfortunately,\nthe Medics experience showed in the\nlast quarter to leave it at 10-15. But one\nthing you do have to remember is that\nthe Medics 4s play competitively every\nweek in ULU and we do not \u2013 so not a\nbad result in the end for us!

Next\nup, the 3rds: after a close first\nhalf the medics then broke\naway, with impressive shooting skills and a solid defensive trio leading them to a\nfinal score of 34-17.

They\nhold that Steve Jobs is the true proph-et, sent to prepare us for the future by\nteaching us of the hidden powers of\nthe half-eaten apple and the mysteries\nof the iPhone.\nIt may be hard for true believers to\nsee the similarities, but to all objective\nonlookers there is no real difference.\nSome may interpret the history in one\nway, others may do it differently, but\nboth of the two great belief systems\nhold that a \u201cnerd did appear in the\nwilderness of the 1970s, and brought\nhe forth an operating system that did\namaze the people.\u201d If the feud wasn\u2019t\nso bitter, it would almost be comical\nto see how divisions have arisen over\nnothing.\nI can\u2019t claim to know much about\nLinux. Compared to the followers of\nJobs and Gates, only a few people have\ntrue faith in Linus Torvalds and his\nteachings. In any case, my experience\nhas shown that Linuxians tend to be a\ngood deal less dogmatic in their beliefs.\nDespite, or maybe because of their\nclear minority status, most have come\nto accept the validity of both other belief systems, and just choose to politely\ndisagree.\nOf course, Linux and Apple have a\nstronger bond than either does with\nMicrosoft \u2013 the teachings of Jobs have\nrecently been interpreted to reveal\nthat Linus Torvalds is, in fact, a minor\nprophet in Appellism. Therefore, his\nteachings and operating system are almost universally accepted in the Mackintoshite world. True, it\u2019s seen as a\nsomewhat fundamentalist subdivision,\nbut their comparative pacifism has\ngained them no real enemies. Besides,\nit\u2019s hard to bear grudges against a people whose supreme deity is a penguin.\nThe point I want to make, though,\nis that there are tremendous possibilities for M\u2019ites and W\u2019sians to get along\npeacefully. It just takes a little objectiv-ity. The moment you stop taking the\nteachings of Jobs or of Gates absolutely\nliterally, there is no reason to prevent\nyou tolerating and respecting your fellow technophile. The last few years\nhave seen a worrying rise in Mac-PC\nviolence, and I think it\u2019s important to\nget this matter under control before it\nbecomes something bigger.\nNow that I\u2019m reaching the end of this,\nI\u2019ll be honest with you; I\u2019m more of an\nasystemist than an agnostic. I believe\nthat there is no supreme operating sys-tem; that all are just as good or just as\nbad. Of course, I\u2019m willing to have my\nopinion changed, but given the state of\nthings, it seems unlikely. Some of my\nmore intense friends hold that actually\nbelieving there is a supreme system is\nharmful. They could be right, I don\u2019t\nknow. It\u2019s certainly very comforting to\nthink that the computer you own qualifies you as a chosen one, but don\u2019t mix\nup comfort with truth.\nIn any case, remember that there is\nmore that links you together than divides you; what you believe shouldn\u2019t\ndrive you apart.\nT\nhe Gaza strip, a small\nplot of land lying in the\nsouth-east of Israel, home\nto some 1.5 million Palestinians, has endured a\nlong and turbulent history to say the\nvery least. It has suffered many long-term trends of economic stagnation\nand desperately low social and welfare\nindicators.\nHowever, over the past few months\nthis situation has witnessed a dramatic\njump in its severity, to the extent that it\nhas become a serious humanitarian cri-sis. The root of this recent exponential\ndecline in living conditions stems from\nthe stringent blockade imposed by Israel in response to the 2006 election\nof Hamas and its subsequent de facto\ntakeover, coupled with the ongoing firing of rockets into Israeli territory.\nA recent report produced collabo-ratively by, amongst others, Amnesty\nInternational, Oxfam and Save the\nChildren has highlighted the dire circumstances of the Gazan population\nwith respect to humanitarian access,\npoverty, food aid, unemployment, basic infrastructure and access to basic\nmedical treatment.\nThe unprecedented rise of poverty\nfollowing the blockade is perhaps, at\nfirstglance,themoststartlingindicator.\nThe crippling restriction of goods and\npeople moving out of or into Gaza has\nresulted in the percentage of those dependent on humanitarian aid rise from\n62% in 2006 to its present day value of\n80%. There are over 1.1 million reliant\non food aid. These figures continue to\nclimb and the UN estimates that the\npercentage dependent on aid will, in\na limited time period, rise \u201cabove and\nbeyond\u201d its current level.\nIn the same breath, the economic\ncollapse of Gaza renders any hope of\nrecovery, whilst under these imposed\nrestrictions, woefully unrealistic. 95%\nof industry is suspended and 3,500 of\nthe 3,900 of its factories have closed\nin the last 6 months due to the ban on\nimported raw materials and exports.\nUnemployment is set to rise to 50% in\nthe near future.\nMeanwhile, the ability for humanitarian aid to be delivered to the Gazan\npopulace has been severely hampered.\nSomewhere in the region of 250 trucks\na day carried commercial and humanitarian supplies to Gaza through Sufa\nprior to the blockade. A maximum,\nwhich is rarely met, of 45 trucks now\npass through Sufa.\nConsequently, the Gaza strip is experiencing a serious electricity deficit as\nthe power plant depends on imported\ndiesel. In principle the plant is able to\nproduce 140MW, sufficient, at least, to\nsupply Gaza city. However, this was reduced to 80MW following the destruction of the original transformers by\nIsrael in 2006. In fact, combined with\nthe restrictions on fuel imports, it now\nonly produces 55-65MW. This has\nserious knock-on effects. Principally,\nit has impeded the supply of running\nwater by some 30% and hospitals face\n8-12 hour blackouts each day.\nWhile the report condemns the\nrocket attacks and states that Israel\nmaintains \u201ca right and obligation to\nprotect its citizens\u201d it stresses that the\nintolerable conditions generated by the\nblockade amount to an indiscriminate\non-going collective punishment of the\nmen, women, and children of Gaza. As\nsuch, it claims that the blockade is illegal under international law set out\nin the Fourth Geneva Convention, as\nratified by Israel in 1949.\nWell, what of it? What can we do?\nThe report concludes that, at the very\nLeron Borsten\nWorking to end the siege of Gaza\nleast, the UK and EU must publicly\ncondemn the blockade and its associated breaches of human rights while\nactively working towards an end to\nthe siege of Gaza. With this in mind,\nI would say one thing we students can\ndo is apply political pressure on our\ngovernment to do just that by joining\nother Imperial students on the \u201cWorld\nagainst War\u201d demonstration, one slogan of which is \u201cend the siege of Gaza\u201d,\ntomorrow (Sat 15th of March). We will\nbe meeting in Beit Quad at 11.20am\nand leaving at 11.45 to join the main\ndemonstration. See you there!

Bottom\nat Christmas with a mere 5 points, the\n4s hopes of staying up looked about\nas alive as Jeremy Beadle but a spring\nterm revival, in which they were the\nform team of the league, saw them\nwith their destiny in their own hands\ngoing into the final game.\nUCL had already won the league by\na distance and came to fortress Harlington eager to show their class. IC\nlined up in normal fashion, with the\n4-5-1 formation that had served them\nso well this term, and were further inspired by the sight of team idol and all\nround good guy Flex QC on the adjacent pitch.. Both teams started well\nwith UCL looking dangerous from the\nright but ICs defence holding firm.\nHowever, halfway through the first half\ngoalkeeper Pursey came to the edge of\nhis box to collect a through ball and\nsomehow ended up handling outside\nthe area. The Why Bird claimed a foul\nbut the ref stood by his decision. The\nresulting free kick was swung in, missing everyone in the box to zoom into\nthe far corner.\nUndeservedly behind, IC continued to play their game and scored an\nequaliser as ridiculous as the passage\nof play leading up to it. A long ball was\nflicked back to the keeper by the studs\nof the centre back, who looked as if\nhe was trying to show his teammates\nthe superman move to Soulja Boy. The\nkeeper picked the ball up and a back\npass was given. From the resulting\nfree kick, Jonny Hill, eager for revenge\nagainst the team who coined his \u2018Fatboy\u2019 alias, picked himself up from his\ndefault position on the floor to plough\nhis way thorough 4 of the men in the\nwall, allowing Damian to fire through\nthe gap to equalise.\n1-1 at half time and so far a solid\nperformance from Aubergine and\nhis charges. 10 minutes into the second half IC were presented with a fab\nchance thanks to an error by the UCL\nkeeper. Matty Smith had time to pick\nhis spot and hit a rocket that was deflected onto the inside of the post \u2013 IC\ninches from taking the lead. However,\nthey couldn\u2019t capitalise on their pressure and some poor defending allowed\nUCL in down the left side and their\nstriker fired home off the far post from\nthe narrowest of angles. IC weren\u2019t\npushing it every way, leaving at least 3\nways they could still push, and 5 minutes later it looked like game over as\ncross from the left wasn\u2019t cleared and\nthe ball was slotted in for 3-1.\nCaptain Scott threw caution to the\nwind and changed to a 3-5-2 in search\nof desperately needed goals, giving the\nteam a refresher with 2 substitutions.\nWith 15 minutes to go, Scott threw\nhimself up front leaving IC\u2019s defence\nabout as safe as a hooker in Ipswich,\nand they should really have been\nmade to pay with UCL missing a host\nof chances. Inside the last 10 IC were\nawarded a free kick on the left corner\nof the box. It looked as if no-one was\ngoing to take it, until Chris stepped up\nand dispatched over the wall into the\ntop corner. IC continued to press and\nwith the clock in the final minute a\nlong ball from Pursey found Damian in\na 50-50 with the keeper, which he won\nto lob the ball over his head and into\nthe unguarded net.\nThe final whistle was blown on the\nfeast of football and IC 4s had earned\nthe point needed to pull off the greatest relegation escape in non-league\nfootball.

A series of scrums lead\nto IC regaining the ball only for it to\nbe stolen by Medics then pushed into\ntouch. The line-outs were generally\nwon by medics due to a clear height\nadvantage. The Medics had some good\nrucking and mauling but when it eventually got out to the backs there was\nsome good tackling by Rebecca Harrison and Roxanne Crossley from IC.\nThe first try came from a turnover ball\nby IC passing right through the hands,\nending with Carla scoring and converting a try.

IC had the\nmajority of the chances, the woodwork\ndenying the home team the lead.\nThe medics came close to scoring\nwith a series of long range shots; how-ever, the Imperial keeper made some\nimpressive saves to deny the visitors\na place on the score sheet. The deadlock was broken midway through the\nsecond period, with IC scoring a well-rehearsed goal from the centre forward\nposition.\nFrom this moment the match took a\nmajor turn, the home team stringing\ntogether a series of break away goals.\nImperial\u2019s defence was solid, not allowing the medics to get a grip on the\ngame. Just before half time John Livesey got the medics off the mark with a\nsuperb shot finding the top-corner.\nVera Gielen showed excellent aware-Medicals left dead in the water by IC\nness in the third period, scoring a\nhat trick of goals in quick succession.\nThis was followed by scores from Ian\nWelch-Philips and Richard Thoburn,\ntaking IC into an 8-1 lead with one period remaining.\nThe final period continued with\nmuch of the same, IC having the majority of possession, scoring two more\ngoals, taking the final score to 10-1.\nThe medic team were unlucky not to\nscore more, the final score slightly flattering the IC team.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDavid Paw\nArts Editor\nS\no it\u2019s been a hectic week in\nthe Felix offices. A couple\nof months ago a friend and\nI were discussing student\nmedia, and came to the common conclusion that the arts are regarded with some degree of incredulity\nat Imperial.\nThe mindset is understandable.\nWhen you\u2019re crunching the numbers\nand spending days in the lab without\nseeing sunlight, who has time for the\nfuss of art? I had spoken to Tom, our\neditor, about Phoenix a couple of weeks\nearlier, asking what had happened to\nthe issue that had never been released.\nIncomplete, I was told.\nMy friend and I moved on to this\ntopic. He then expressed interest in\nreprising the title, but only on the condition that I was on board. Of course,\nI agreed enthusiastically, and so the\nwheels were set in motion.\nTwo months of phone calls, emails\nand nights staring at monitors and\nreading and re-reading masses of poems and short stories and we were\ngood to go. Myself and a new team\nhad picked our favourites of the writing that had been sent to us, and approached known favourites to allow\nthem to get some exposure and share\nthe love.\nWe worked on the layout together,\nbickered over covers and decided the\nbest path forward for the title, and the\nexperience was completely liberating\nfrom the creative shackles that such a\nscience-focused environment can im-pose. We all loved working on it, and\nlove the finished product.\nIt doesn\u2019t look like any Phoenix that\nhas come before. We weren\u2019t trying to\nbe controversial or draw criticism. We\nwanted to produce something that was\nfun to read, fun to look at and something that would add some zest and\nzap into the college\u2019s roster of (admit-tedly already impressive) publications.\nWe drew our influences from a wide\nrange of sources - we loved the content\nof The New Yorker, the irreverence of\nNew York Magazine, the manic design\nof Zembla and the clean shapes of\nSurface and i-D. The product is a sort\nof crossroads of these multitudinous\ninfluences but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s too\nincoherent. We won\u2019t put a picture of\nBjork in face paint and feathers on the\ncover. Promise.\nWhathitmethemostwhenresearching the design was the sheer number of\nmagazines available. Even disregarding\nthe number of titles in the mainstream\npress, there are still an incredible\nnumber of smaller titles with dedicated followings. What also struck me\nwas the sheer volume of talented writers out there; even with the number of\ntitles available in print, there are still an\nawful lot of good writers out there who\ngo unrecognised. Phoenix aims to support these writers and provide a creative platform within the college.\nThere\u2019s a lot to be inspired by out\nthere. The first issue of the relaunched,\nreimagined and redesigned 21st century Phoenix will be here on the first\nissue of the new summer term.\nSymphonies for beginners\nWe couldn\u2019t decide whether Fran\u2019s article was about knitting or music. We had a fight. Shit got broken. I don\u2019t know how this picture got here\nT\nhough there are many\npeople that consider\nthemselves aficionados\nof classical music, I am\nnot one of them. And yet,\nICSO\u2019s performance on Friday, conducted by Richard Dickins, convinced\nme you don\u2019t have to have a diploma\non the cor anglais to enjoy an evening\nof classical music.\nA top tip for the uninitiated classical\nenthusiast is to purchase a programme;\nworth it not only for the insightful tidbits of information about the music,\nbut also as a tool to relieve boredom as\nyou reach the end of a particularly long\nmovement (I know I said I\u2019m not the\ntype to use technical terms. For those\nunacquainted, a movement is a section of the music; these are separated\nby silences during which it is vitally\nimportant that you don\u2019t clap. As a\nrule of thumb, always wait until clapping is well underway during classical\nconcerts so you can be sure you aren\u2019t\nclapping in between movements and\nembarrassing yourself).\nThe concert opened with a rendition of Wagner\u2019s Prelude to Tristan &\nIsolde. This piece is quite short, and\nI must admit I knitted throughout (I\nam knitting my boyfriend a snood),\nbut the cello section particularly stood\nout. The programme reliably informs\nme that they are \u2018answering a question\nposed by the short motif\u2019. However, I\ncannot verify this statement. The tension in my knitting remained roughly\nconstant. (It is perfectly acceptable, by\nthe way, to knit or write poetry in classical music concerts, as long as noise is\nkept to a minimum. You should let the\nmusic \u201cwash over you\u201d).\nThe second piece was undoubtedly\nmy favourite: Piano Concerto in G Major (Ravel). The pianist Charles Owen\nwas absolutely amazing. My partner\nsaid he swayed too much, but I think\nsomeone with that talent may sway (al-beit pretentiously) when they play the\npiano and, besides, he was just jealous\nbecause after 7 years of lessons his piano talents only extend to a shaky rendition of The Entertainer. I was captivated by this piece for the whole three\nmovements and had to put down my\nknitting to concentrate. I only wish I\nwere sitting on the other side of the hall\nso that I could see him actually playing.\nThe first movement had a lovely sultry\njazz feel to it, and was my favourite as\nI\u2019m rather partial to a bit of jazz.\nAfter the interval, the audience was\ntreated to a rendition of Mahler\u2019s Symphony no.1 in D major. Despite the\nlength, which may have put some amateur classical music fans off, this performance was quite moving, particularly the third movement featuring a\nsinister motif from Fr\u00e8re Jacques. This\nis praise indeed coming from a person\nwho admits freely to being bored by\nclassical music, particularly the quieter and slower bits. However, the last\nmovement was akin to the last Lord of\nthe Rings film; it ended a few times too\nmany. Despite this, the actual finale\nwas rousing and buoyant.\nOverall, the concert was extremely\ngood. I found that ICSO chose slightly\nmore discordant pieces than Sinfonietta earlier in the week, perhaps making\nthem less easy on the untrained ear, but\nthe quality of the playing was absolutely fabulous. After much consideration,\nI decided to award the best-dressed\nsection award to the second group of\nviolins, after one of them spent the\nbest part of the second half trying to\nuntangle a beautiful earring from her\nviolin. Classical music is always full of\ndrama.\nFrancesca Buckland postpones her knitting to revel in the ICSO\u2019s aural candy\n\n"

    "content": "18 felix Friday 14 March 2008\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nAttention \u2013 For Your Eyes Only\nIndie style in a West End production? Lucy Harrold explores the complex world of The Viewing Room\nTimmy waited tentatively for his bedtime story\nD\naniel Joshua Rubin\u2019s\nclaustrophobic play The\nViewing Room is the first\nWest End outing of writing company Practicum\nTheatre, and has just started at the Arts\nTheatre. The theatre is really close to\nLeicester Square; if you can find Cranbourn Street, you can find it. At the\nmoment it will also be surrounded by\nsmall geeky people trying to procure\nLeonard Roberts\u2019 autograph \u2013 but\nmore on this later. The theatre itself is\nkind of cute, sandwiched next to the\nphotographer\u2019s gallery (which I was really tempted to visit but didn\u2019t have the\ntime). Inside you\u2019ll find a theatre that\ndoesn\u2019t really suit the West End. The\nlobby and bar are modern, and there\nare only two entrances to the theatre\n\u2013 the mezzanine and stalls - making it\ntiny in proportion to the nearby Palace\ntheatre where Les Miserables is play-ing, or the Cambridge theatre where\nChicago is still going strong. Also, in a\ndeparture from most West End thea-tres, you\u2019re allowed to bring your drink\ninto the auditorium, although you\nmight not want to for this play - given\nthe twists in the plot you might end up\nwith your beer in your lap! This added\nto the style of the play, making me feel\nmore like I was attending an off-West\nEnd production that could afford to\ncome to the West End because of its\ncast\u2019s calibre.\nThe set suggests that you\u2019ll be in for a\nnice, twee play about an urban couple -a typical flat not dissimilar to those we\nlive in. There\u2019s a pull-out futon, a little\nkitchen area, the usual. There were also\nvideo screens either side of the main\nstage. These were used to great effect\nproviding continuous coverage of the\nstage in pseudo-Big Brother fashion.\nThe television screens also provided\nall of the sound effects for the play.\nThis seemed like a good idea at first.\nHowever, I was sitting right in front\nof one of the screens and so just got\nblasted with one earful of sound with\nnothing in the other ear. But just as I\nwas finishing reading the programme,\nI looked up to find a huge cage plonked\nin the middle of the stage. Well, that\u2019ll\nteach me to pay attention. The cage is\nthe focal point of both the stage and the\nplay, containing almost a negative mirror image of the outside of the cage.\nInside is a black man accused of a\ncrime he is adamant he did not com-mit. Outside are a white couple who\nhave chosen to have him in their home\nas part of their social service. This social service, the audience learns early\non, is something all people have to\ndo because of an \u201congoing war of our\ntime\u201d.\nThere are different ways people can\ndo their community service, but the\ncouple choose this so that they can stay\nat home. Unfortunately, the audience\ndo not learn this until quite late on in\nthe play, and is one of the few problems in the show. Exposition is seldom\ngiven and, although the play could be\nset in any time period, this leads to\nsome small plot points being lost like\nwhenever the couple leave the house,\nthey are wearing gas masks. It is never\nfully explained why the gas masks are\nneeded. A smog of some sort is mentioned somewhere in the play but only\nas a throwaway remark. I don\u2019t know\nwhether the writer has chosen to leave\nout much of the exposition as a way of\nmoving the plot along, or to let the audience think for themselves.\nThe play, as expected, explores the\nrelationship between the couple and\nthis new prisoner. But it also explores\nthe relationship between an ordinary\ncouple in extraordinary circumstances,\nand the relationship between ordinary\npeople and the government. I can\u2019t tell\nyou too much about the storyline as\nthe play is full of plot twists that you\ncould never guess (the one at the end\nwas a real shock, but also led to a funny\nscenario at curtain call). The audience\nis lulled into a sense of security every\nso often as you think that the three\ncharacters are starting to get on, when\nyou\u2019re suddenly ripped out of that relationship by a new incident. The husband and wife could be seen to represent two mindsets that we often have\nabout new situations. At the start of\nthe play Brian, the husband, is an ideal-ist. He believes that whatever the government says must be correct \u2013 he is\ntaken in by society. On the other hand,\nthe wife (she has no name, which is another comment on the role of women)\nis the dubious one. Of course, these\nopinions change rapidly throughout\nthe story.\nJames Flyn played Brian Walker, the\nhusband; his transition from an enthusiastic and loving husband at the\nbeginning of the play to an almost psychotic all-obeying society drone by the\nend was seamless and rather disturb-ing. He was very adept at pushing the\naudiences\u2019 buttons to make them em-pathise with his situation. Samantha\nWright was equally impressive as \u201cThe\nWife\u201d. She brought a sense of realism\nand also depth to a role that at first\ncould be perceived as the weak link\nin the writing. Although I think this is\none of the writer\u2019s tricks played on the\naudience, her character develops later\nto allow the audience to become supposedly comfortable with Brian and\nthe prisoner. Of course most people\nwill be coming to see this play as they\nhave heard of Leonard Roberts. Roberts played DL Hawkins in the smash\nhit series Heroes (one of my favourite\nprograms) and has also been in shows\nlike Buffy (another one of my favour-ites, noticing a pattern?) and Smallville. I didn\u2019t know what to expect of\nRoberts, as his on-screen persona has\ncarved a niche from portraying strong,\nsilent types. I found from the programme that he has quite an extensive\nUS theatre career, which comforted my\nprevious apprehensions. Roberts took\nwhat could have been quite a flat and\nshallow role and gave it depth and hu-mility. His prisoner, although gruff and\nmean to some, actually had a sense of\nhumour, giving a glimpse of his former\nself before prison.\nThe evening I attended was in aid of\nAmnesty International, as the themes\nof the play are very relevant to the\nwork Amnesty do concerning unjust\nimprisonment in places such as Guantanamo Bay. As part of this, after the\nshow was a short discussion given by\nthe director, the cast and QC Michael\nMansfield, a specialist in miscarriages\nof justice (who I thought looked a bit\nlike Christopher Biggins). The writer\nof the play also happened to be sitting\nat the back of the theatre and piped up\npart way through, moving to the row\nin front of me (!!) to answer some of\nthe questions, although he appeared to\nget a bit disheartened when he wasn\u2019t\nallowed to answer all of the questions.\nThemes from the play were discussed\nby both the panel and audience and left\nme with much to think about.\nThe play brings up themes of punishing the collective for the mistakes\nof an individual (like when you were\nat school and someone did something\nnaughty yet you all had stay in for detention - I\u2019m still bitter about that). It\nalso brought up our role in society and\nour obedience under a surveillance-obsessed society. Without giving away\ntoo much of the plot, the play linked\nvery well to present-day situations of\nprisoners around the world who are\ngiven unfair trials due to the colour of\ntheir skin, and because it is generally\neasier to throw them in prison. Both\nthe play and the later discussion also\nquestioned the role of prison: whether\nit is to punish, store or rehabilitate.\nThe play left you pondering which of\nthese roles the situation in the play\nrepresented. This was really the thinking (wo)man\u2019s play, something rarely\nseen in the West End but which should\nbe encouraged and with concession\ntickets at only \u00a310, I suggest you all\nsee this worthwhile play. It might make\nyou take a look at your thoughts and\nbeliefs about the prison system and our\nsurveillance-blanketed society.\nDon\u2019t think her bloke\u2019ll be best pleased...\n\n"

Leading 21-0\nthe Medicals were forced to work hard\nby a spirited Kings Medical (formerly\nGKT) side who came back strongly in\nthe second half with tries from Matt\nMorgan and Lucas Rehnberg taking\nthe final score to 21-12.\nSunshine and showers greeted the\nsides at London Welsh\u2019s Old Deer Park\nground for the United Hospitals Challenge Cup final, the oldest rugby competition still in existence which was\nfirst contested 134 years ago in 1875.\nInjured skipper Austin Dekker selected a squad with a pleasing mixture\nof youth and experience with centre\nJames Logan, who led the Medicals to\nvictory in 2006, being handed the captain\u2019s armband. Special mention must\nbe reserved for freshers Ed Pickles,\nCraig Nightingale and James Sharples whose excellent performances this\nseason meant they were selected in the\nstarting XV ahead of many Medicals\u2019\nstalwarts.\nPlayingwiththebreezeinthefirsthalf\nthe Medicals started brightly with halfbacks Tom Maynard and Dan Neville\nkeeping the Medicals in GKT territory\nfor much of the opening stanza. Strong\nball carrying by Ben Davies and James\nLogan gave dangerous wings James\nSharples and Harry Thompson space\nout wide, however, the fervid Guy\u2019s\ndefence led by the back row of Rob\nHone, Mark Halls and Matt Morgan\nprevented the Medicals from crossing\nthe line early on. The set-piece was\nalso keenly contested with Ed Pickles,\nRuairidh Crawford and Xander AnJeremy Bartosiak-Jentys\ncock being well matched by their GKT\ncounterparts in the scrum. At the lin-eout Rhys Davies and 2nd row partner\nRoss Ferry had a ding-dong battle with\nMedicals lineout duo Peter O\u2019Neill and\nRob Anderson.\nIt wasn\u2019t until almost halfway\nthrough the opening period that the\ndeadlock was finally broken. A mix-up by GKT centres Pete Robinson and\nAdam Staten gave the Medicals possession in broken play. Making the most\nof the splintered defence James Logan\ngathered the ball and showed tremendous pace to beat GKT left wing James\nCuthbertson on the outside. Keeping\na cool head Logan ran round to touch\ndown under the posts making the conversion a formality for fly-half Dan\nNeville. On 35 minutes Peter Russell\nreplaced Ruairidh Crawford, who had\nplayed 80 minutes against Stevenage\nthe previous day, at hooker.\nAfter Guy\u2019s had passed up a try-scor-ing opportunity of their own through\na straightforward handling error the\nMedicals were to extend their lead just\nprior to the interval. From a well executed lineout the backline put the hard\nwork on the training ground into practice by running a devastating set move.\nWith dummy runners disorientating\nthe GKT defence, Huw Williams was\nable to cut a line from full-back, receive Neville\u2019s perfectly weighted pass\nand run in under the posts untouched.\nNeville duly added the extras.\nLeading 14-0 at half time the Medicals set a game plan to kill off the game\nin the second half by playing for territory and keeping Guy\u2019s on the back foot.\nAnd the opening minutes of the second\nperiod certainly went to plan. Guy\u2019s\nfly-half John Kendel launched a high\nball for Lucas Rehnberg to chase, how-ever, Medicals wing Harry Thompson\nstayed calm under pressure to take the\nball cleanly, break a tackle and offload\nto put openside flanker Craig Nightingale into space on the left wing. The\nfleet-footed fresher managed to out\npace the covering Mark Halls and fullback Mike Forsythe to dive over ten\nmetres from the left touchline. Neville\nmade no mistake with the tricky con-version. Shortly after James Saffin and\nXander Ancock were replaced by the\nlivewire Graham Corin and weighty\nJeremy Bartosiak-Jentys respectively.\nGuy\u2019s driven by the dread of walking away with another runners-up\nmedal fought back valiantly putting\nthe Medicals under sustained pressure\nmid-way through the second half. The\npressure finally told as a clean Guy\u2019s\nlineout was mauled towards the Medicals line. Despite desperate attempts to\nstop the drive GKT were able to cross\nthe whitewash with No.8 Matt Morgan\nable to touch down despite the close\nattention of Peter Russell. Pete Gretton\nwas successful with the conversion to\nnarrow the Medicals lead to 14 points.\nLooking to add an experienced head to\nthe fold Francois Tudor was brought\non to replace Anakan Navaratnam in\nthe Medicals\u2019 back row.\nThe change did little for the Medicals\nfortunes as Guy\u2019s piled on the pressure\nwith the Medicals, playing into the\nwind in the second period, finding it\ndifficult to clear their lines effectively.\nIt was, therefore, of little surprise when\nfrom an attacking scrum on the Medicals\u2019 five metre line Guy\u2019s exploited\nspace on the blind side to put wing Lucas Rehnberg in by the right-hand corner flag. Gretton was unable to add the\nextras from the right touchline.\nThe Medicals, desperate to regain\nsome control, tightened up the game\nby using their big forwards to pick\nand go around the fringes of the ruck,\nthereby retaining possession and running down the clock. Much credit\nmust go to courageous Medicals scrum\nhalf Tom Maynard who continued to\nbellow instructions at his forwards despite playing much of the game with a\nbroken jaw. Everyone at the club would\nlike to wish Tom a speedy recovery. As\nthe final seconds ticked away and the\nreferee brought the contest to an end\nthe Medicals\u2019 could bask in the glory\nof winning the coveted cup for the seventh consecutive year.\nRob Anderson breaking through the GKT line\nThe IC ladies\u2019 1st team played their last\ngame in the ULU Challenge Cup \u2013 the\nfinal \u2013 against GKT on a cold Sunday\nin Chiswick. Initially, IC were able\nto dominate, on a sticky pitch which\nseemed to be alternately flooded and\nbone dry in places, and we spent much\nof the early stages of the game in the\nGKT half.\nIt became clear pretty quickly that\nGKT were going to be quick on the\ncounter-attack, and several moments\nof panic were had by all \u2013 illustrated\nby Womble\u2019s cries of \u2018oh sh*t!\u2019 whenever a GKT player and/or a ball got too\nclose for comfort. MJ saved the day a\nnumber of times, before IC conceded\nJess Poore\nan unfortunate goal from an intercepted free hit \u2013 to the disappointment of\nour support, sharing their attention\nbetween us and the Men\u2019s 2nd team.\nWith some more attacking pressure\nright at the end of the first half, Malbinas got us a penalty corner, and Cumbum stepped up with a strike which,\ninitially blocked, allowed Malbinas to\nnick us a goal.\nThe second half did bring some\nmore scoring opportunities, and a few\nmore penalty corners, but we couldn\u2019t\nconvert, and there was ever-present\ndanger from the GKT counter-attack\nand the enormous number of penalty\ncorners they had. Unfortunately for IC,\nthe threat materialized \u2013 even support\nfrom the IC medics, arriving for their\ncup final and varsity game couldn\u2019t\nprevent the score going to 3-1, with\ntwo goals from GKT. When the final\nwhistle blew, leaving us with one final\npenalty corner to defend, we couldn\u2019t\ndo any more but keep it out and finish\nthe game with a respectable \u2013 if disappointing \u2013 3-1 loss.\nLadies hockey\nmiss out to GKT\nin ULU cup final\nHockey\nULU Cup\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 1\nGKT Women\u2019s 1st 3\nRugby\nUH Cup Final\nImperial Medicals 1st 21\nGKT Men\u2019s 1st 12\nAfter beating the 7s three times this\nseason, the 6s decided to do them a favour and thrash GKT 5s (fellow relegation candidates). After tolling the bell,\nDamian, Fitz, Sim and Turrell came\nforth to play for the cause and destroy\nsome medics.\nAfter a standard shaky first 5 min-utes, we grabbed the game by the\nscruff of the neck and dominated the\nrest of the match. Damian and Hardy\nwere tearing their defence to shreds\nand bringing Ward and Sim into play\nbrilliantly.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before we got our first\nin true old skool 6th team style with\na through ball to Sim who lashed it\npassed the keeper. We didn\u2019t create\nmany more chances in the first half as\nthey were defending quite well, but I\nwas happy to be freezing my ass off in\ngoal as I had nothing at all to do all half.\nSapin, Justin, Field and Tony all playing\nbrilliantly.\nOur second goal came not long after\nhalf time and was a thing of beauty.\nDamian \u201cWelshy\u201d Phelan picked up\nthe ball in midfield and brought it for-ward. After hearing Rob screaming for\nthe ball on the left, played a cross field\npass into the space for Rob to run onto,\nwho put a cross right onto Hardy\u2019s\nhead for him to nod it home. Hardy\nalso got our third when Turrell played\nthe ball to him in the box and he took\nit round the defender before poking it\npast the keeper.\nGKT got back into the game a bit\nmore, but it wasn\u2019t until well into the\nsecond half before they had their first\nshot on target, which I saved brilliantly\nwith my face. Unfortunately though,\nwe were cheated out of our first clean\nsheet of the season by the ref; our own\nDavid Sapin. His excuse was that he\nwas enjoying reffing but hadn\u2019t given\na foul yet. He also didn\u2019t realise that\nFitz\u2019s tackle was in the box and was\ninch perfect.\nNeedless to say, I conceded my third\npenalty of the season. That was the last\neffort on target they had, as we went\nstraight down the other end and scored\na fourth. Sim swivelled in the box and\nlifted it over the keeper out of nothing.\nTwo or three more goals could have\nfollowed, but to spare them the em-barrassment, we (I mean Damian and\nMike) decided to only shoot from at\nleast 20 yards. However, the Sondergaard show continued, climaxing with\nhim lifting the ball over the heads of\ntwo on-rushing GKT players and making them look like idiots.\nAfter the final whistle, Airborne\nRanger rang out across Teddington to\ncap off a good season for the 6s. 5th\nplace in the league and we reached the\ncup semi-final. 2nd best team in the\nclub.

I\ncheck them more often than I go on Facebook or check my emails and they are\ntaking over my life. I can\u2019t seem to sleep\nat night and I just sit and refresh them\nuntil they are updated. How can I get\nover this ridiculous obsession?\nIHeartPerez\nDear IHeartPerez\nYou are now one step along the slow\nroad that leads to a degree. Obsession with the Internet is just part and\nparcel of the whole education system.\nYou need to learn to channel this into\nan obsession with wikipedia, or something with more useful knowledge on it\n(unless you wish to become a \u201cwriter\u201d\n\u2013inverted commas on purpose \u2013 for\nHeat magazine). I think you should\nstart listing your extensive celebrity\nknowledge as one of your skills on your\nCV; you might begin to find yourself in\ndemand for pub quiz teams (especially\nat Imperial, where knowledge of popular culture is lacking significantly).\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy McNeedy\nMy flatmate\u2019s boyfriend lives in another\ncity, but quite often comes to stay for a\nweek or sometimes longer. I like him;\nit\u2019s just that when he\u2019s here, they don\u2019t\nget out of bed the whole time! She tells\nme all they do is have sex; she comes\ndownstairs and complains how tired\nshe is. But what she doesn\u2019t realise is\nthat I can hear every little movement\nfrom her room, and I think I\u2019m probably getting even less sleep than her.

What can I do?\nSleepless\nDear Sleepless\nDespite you clearly just being jealous\nof her situation (as we all are; who\nwouldn\u2019t want a man who can keep going all day), there are a few steps you\ncan take to solve the situation. Firstly,\nbuy some egg boxes and insulate the\nwall between your rooms, or invest in\na good pair of earplugs. Secondly, invite them outside to play croquet (I\u2019ve\nheard it is a brilliant substitute for constant fucking.) Thirdly, find a partner\nand outdo them (for maximum noise,\nand thus effect, you might consider\nputting up a sex swing). If none of these\nwork and you\u2019re still bored and sleep-less, you might want to consider offering to join in. If they are embarrassed\nand say no, they might at least think to\nkeep the noise down in future.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy McNeedy\nMy girlfriend and I have been going out\nfor a while, but recently we got quite\ndrunk together and she admitted to\ncheating on me with another woman.\nShe said she really enjoyed it and might\nlike to try it again.

It\u2019s nearly\nthe demise of this term.\nAbout time too. Don\u2019t\nknow about you, but I\ncertainly need a break.\nA long long break to get my bearings\nright again. Have been running on\nempty of late, my batteries seriously\nneed recharging. Rewind in time to\nroughly a fortnight ago, I braved the\nchilly still-Winterish weather and\ntubed it to Camden to see the boys\nfrom Pecknam, namely The Metros.\nHow I detest the tube. Crushed, elbowed and confined in a hot smelly\ntrain with a bunch of strangers at rush\nhour is far from the sublime bliss that\na chilled-out evening lounging on the\nsofa could offer. The sacrifices I make\nfor this crazy, majorly hard slog of a\njob. Being only a considerably mild victim of travel sickness (thank God), one\ntends to leg it out, as fast as one could,\nfrom the imprisonment that stuffy vehicles of any shape or size brings.\nHaving never done a face-to-face interview before, I was delighted when\nit turned out to be very laidback and\nstraightforward. My previous preconceptions of arrongant so and sos who\nhave landed themselves the honeypot\nwere met with two sound guys who\ntruly enjoyed what they are doing,\nmaking music and playing to their\nhearts\u2019 content. Saul the frontman/lead\nsinger did not lack any charisma, with\na playful twinkle in his eyes the whole\ntime, whilst Joe the bassist was earthy,\ngenerally good-humored and friendly.\nWe chatted about a weird bunch of\nrandom things and, of course, music.\nWhat else? You will find a few interesting snippets about these cheeky\nboys too.\nI went to see the brilliant Editors at\nAlexandra Palace. last week. When\nTom Smith, the vocalist sauntered on\nstage, phwoar, what a vision, I mused.\nDidn\u2019t know he was a looker as well\nas being a superb crowd-pleaser. The\nband effortlessly rode on a wave of incredible energy, culminating in a sensational showcase of quality tunes and\nimmense soundscapes. It\u2019s times like\nthese that I love being a music editor.\n30th March. My birthday. Won\u2019t be\nsweet 18 anymore. Damn. Last year of\nmy teens. Bloody scary, if you ask me.\nTime to leave adolescence and join the\nworld of adulthood. March time also\nmeans that Easter is looming. Chocolate binge sessions. We had early Easter egg tasting sessions in Felix offices\nthis week. Mmm. Thorntons and Lindor, music to my ears. Good chocolate\ncan be heavenly, but one might just feel\nslightly queasy after an overdose. Never got to that stage yet. I can manage\nto live a relatively colourful life without\nchocolate even though it does mean\nthat I\u2019d have to pig out on biscuits in-stead. But, decent music at the end of\nthe day can beat chocolate anytime.\nIf you fancy reviewing some\nmusic or gigs, send us an email\nat music.felix@imperial.ac.uk and\nget yourself on the mailing list.\nFree music giveaway soon, stay\ntuned!\nThe Metros are essentially 5 lads from\nPecknam, South London, who have\njumped on the bandwagon that is\nRock \u2018n\u2019 Roll. The band consists of Saul\n(lead singer), Joe (bassist), Jak (guitar-ist), Charlie (guitarist) and last but not\nleast, Freddie (drummer). Currently\nthey are zooming across the country\non a headline tour, with their debut\nsingle release \u2018Education Pt. 2\u2019 on the\nnear horizon.

See across\nthe page for the review itself.\nWho thought of the name \u2018The\nMetros\u2019?\nSaul: Me and the guitar player Jak, we\nwent through a lot of shit names, like\n\u2018Orange Juice\u2019, \u2018Eastern Block\u2019\u2026but\nanyway, we decided that we couldn\u2019t\nthink of anything and we had to come\nup with a name so we went for \u2018The\nMetros\u2019. Incidentally, there\u2019s another\nband called The Metros. Somebody\nmade the mistake at T in the Park, saying that we sound like a cross between\nearly Beatles and Stereophonics. He\nmeant The Metros from Swansea.\nThat\u2019s not us.\nHow did you guys get together?\nJoe: Me, the bassist and the drummer\nall went to school together.\nSaul: Me and Jak have known each other most of our lives. Our parents are\npublishers. We all kind of know each\nother through Freddie, the drummer.\nHe\u2019s kind of brought us together.\nHow long have you been playing\ntogether?\nSaul: Almost three years all together.\nHow old are you?\nJoe: Us two are 19 and the others are\n18.\nDescribe yourselves in five words.\nSaul: Five boys with guitars/\nmicrophones.\nWho writes the songs?\nSaul: Me and Jak write the songs. That\u2019s\nwhy we are rich and you are poor.\nWhere do you get your\ninspirations?\nSaul: Anywhere really. Mostly from\ngetting signed and earning money\nand being frustrated. Also, from living\nin South London. Old records - Stiff\nRecords inspire me.\nJoe: Basically from playing gigs so we\nthat could get into venues and getting\na few drinks because we were that skint\nback then.\nHow are you guys finding touring\nat the moment?\nSaul: It\u2019s great man.\nJoe: We have a great laugh.\nDo you guys fight?\nSaul and Joe in unison: Yes.\nProper fights?\nSaul: Not fist fights.\nJoe: I almost got into a physical fight\nwith the bassist at the Skins Festival. I\nkicked over his drink by accident and\nhe threw a drink in my face and it sort\nof escalated from there. I slapped him\nin the face and he slapped me even\nharder. Then he pushed me against a\nwall and the drummer was trying to\nbreak us up. And me and Charlie the\nbassist, we were like \u201cFuck this man,\nfucking prick\u201d. So yeah. But apart from\nthat, we are all quite friendly.\nDo you think music improves\nwith age?\nSaul: Yes. A lot of bands, with their first\nalbum, it\u2019s always kind of raw isn\u2019t it?\nAs you get older, you become wiser\nand you start to write better music.\nProper music. Hopefully.\nHow did you get to collaborate\nwith Toddla T?\nSaul: He\u2019s great, a really nice bloke and\nshould be supporting us tonight. He\u2019s\nfrom the same record label as us. He\u2019s\nproduced music for people like Jamie T\nand stuff like that. It\u2019s all good. We are\ngoing to do some more collaboration\nwith him in the future.\nIf you were to play with any band\nalive or dead who would it be?\nSaul: Err\u2026What\u2019s that geezer\u2019s name?\nThe one who sang \u2018I\u2019ve put a spell on\nyou\u2019\u2026Screaming Jay Hawkins. Ian\nDury and The Blockheads too. They\nare like an obvious band. I\u2019d quite like\nto play with The Sex Pistols and The\nClash back in the 1970s. That would\nbe pretty cool man.\nWhat\u2019s the best gig you\u2019ve ever\nplayed?\nSaul:That\u2019sreallydifficult.We\u2019veplayed\nso many gigs. Best venue we\u2019ve played\nat is probably at the Roundhouse.\nThat\u2019s the biggest gig we\u2019ve played at.\nThat\u2019s was fucking awesome.\nJoe: We really enjoyed the little venues\nas well.\nSaul: But when we go on tour, we play\nin shitholes where no one has heard of,\nplaces like Hull. Horrible places. Some\npeople say London is a horrible place\nto play gigs. The crowd can be rather\nnasty.\nJoe: People come on stage and steal\nstuff. They try to pull leads from our\nguitars while we are playing and taking\nthem as souvenirs.\nWho do you think that your music\nis aimed at?\nSaul: Well, I would like to have thought\nthat our music is aimed at cool people.\nWhat is the best thing about being in the music business?\nSaul: You get lots of free food and\ndrinks. Free stuff. And you don\u2019t have\nto get a job.\nJoe: You can enjoy what you are doing\nfor free and you get paid for it.\nDo you get paid a lot?\nSaul: Yeah. We are alright. We\u2019ve signed\na publishing deal for quite a lot of money but we are not sorted for life.\nJoe: We don\u2019t get paid for doing individual gigs anymore.\nFootball or rugby?\nSaul: Neither.\nJoe: I\u2019d go for rugby if I have to. Table\ntennis man, that\u2019s what I\u2019d go for.\nWho gets the most attention from\nthe girls?\nSaul: Probably me I suppose.\nJoe: That\u2019s probably true. Saul\u2019s the\nlead singer so he gets the most atten-tion. Girls like him.\nDo you have girlfriends?\nSaul: We all have girlfriends.\nPubs or nightclubs?\nSaul: Pubs.\nJoe: It depends on what kind of mood\nI\u2019m in.\nWhat\u2019s the best cure for a\nhangover?\nSaul: More booze\u2026Iron Bru man\u2026\nApparently, a pint of beer with a shot of\nexpresso in the beer.

He\nis due to appear and defend himself in court on 20th March\ncharged with non-payment of Council Taxes during his thesis\nwriting-up period\nUCL Union bans military societies\nControversy as UCLU declares war on student military organisations to protest Iraq and Afghan conflicts\nA graduating Imperial PhD student is\nbeing taken to court by his local Council for non-payment of Council Taxes\nduring his thesis writing-up period.\nMatthew Yong, an ex-Aeronautical\nEngineering student, has been summoned by the Camden & Islington Local Justice Area to appear in court on\n20th March, charged with owing six\nmonths worth of Council Tax to the\nsum of \u00a3675.08\nThe majority of PhD students apply for \u201cwriting-up status\u201d at the end\nof their third year, the idea being that\nthey will have finished their research\nand will only need to write their thesis.\nIf they are successful, they are granted\na six-month period during which they\nare not required to pay tuition fees,\nhowever, they have certain student\nprivileges cut and restrictions imposed\nupon them, such as: they are only allowed access to certain areas of College; they no longer receive TfL (Trans-port For London) discounts; and they\nare given limited access to their project\nsupervisors.\nThe amount and severity of reduced\nprivileges differs between universities\nacross the country. Currently, Imperial refuses to award its writing-up\nstudents Council Tax exemption cer-tificates, hence, the case being brought\nagainst Mr Yong by Camden Council.\nMr Yong strongly disputes having\nto pay the six-months worth of Council Tax. He is willing to fight his case\nstating that: \u201cI will not only be vigorously defending my position, but will\nalso seek to reclaim costs for having to\ntake a day off work and commute back\nto London to sort this stressful matter\nout.\u201d Mr Yong claims to \u201cmeet all criteria for being a full time student \u2026 as\noutlined in Statutory Instrument 1992\nNo. 548 The Council Tax (Discount\nDisregards) Order 1992\u201d; namely that\nhe has been attending a course which\nlasted more than one year, for more\nthan 24 weeks per year in which he has\ncompleted more than 21 hours of work\nper week.\nMr Yong made attempts to communicate with Camden Council, however\nthey have not replied to his letters or\nemails. Furthermore, he has the backing of his local Conservative candidate,\nChris Philp, Imperial College Union\nand his PhD project supervisors who\nhave written letters of support to Camden Council stating that he was a full-time student in their views, which have\nalso received no reply.\nDespite these letters, Camden Council is resolute in charging Mr Yong the\nCouncil Tax because, according to a\nstudent certificate they received from\nCollege, he is not in full time educa-tion. When Felix attempted to contact\nCamden Council, a spokesperson said\nthat: \u201cImperial College have issued a\nstudent certificate until the date Mr\nYong's course ended on 4/7/2007 and\nhave confirmed verbally to us that\nhe has not been on a full time course\nsince that date. He cannot, therefore,\nget a student exemption. This has been\nexplained to him [when he visited us\nin person] and as normal practice we\nhave sent him a summons for non-pay-ment of tax since that date. We would\nbe happy to review the position if the\nCollege issued us a further certificate,\nwhich confirmed the writing up of his\nPhD constitutes continuation of his\nfull time course.\u201d\nFelix attempted to contact College,\nhowever they were not available for\ncomment before going to print.\nMr Yong\u2019s case highlights a long-running issue that many students\nstudying a PhD have to consider. Without funding, PhD students effectively\nface unemployment when they start\ntheir writing-up phase, yet depending\non which university they attend, they\nare expected to pay Council Tax even\nthough they are discouraged from\nfinding part-time employment in order to concentrate on completing their\nthesis.\nThe UK\u2019s universities have differing stances on the privileges afforded\nto postgraduates in the writing-up phase. For example, Oxford,\nCambridge, Birmingham, Leeds\nand Edinburgh Universities class\nwriting-up postgraduates as full-time students, whereas Bristol,\nCardiff, Glasgow and Southampton Universities will not guarantee their students Council Tax\nexemption certificates. The NUS\n(National Union of Students) is\nin the process of campaigning\nfor a consistent national ruling\nthat is fairer towards students.\nAlthough the Union and Mr\nYong\u2019s project supervisors\nhave offered their support,\nthere is only so much they can\ndo. The crux of the situation\ncomes down to whether or not\nwriting-up students should be\nclassed as full-time students\nor not. Depending on which\nLondon borough a writing-up\nstudent lives in, they may or\nmay not have to pay Council\nTax. It is futile for Imperial\nCollege Union to negotiate\nwith Councils because there\nare so many in London. Ultimately, the decision as to\nwhether a writing-up student should be given full-time status time lies with\nCollege.\nSabbatical Officers from\nthe Union are meeting with\nCollege staff in May to encourage them to revise\nImperial\u2019s current policy.\nHowever, this may prove to\nbe too little, too late for Mr\nYong who could be coughing up six months worth of\nCouncil Tax come March\n20th.\nIf you are in similar circumstances\nto Mr Yong and need advice, you\ncan contact Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare), Kirsty\nPatterson, by emailing her on\ndpew@imperial.ac.uk\nUCL Union has passed a motion banning student military organisations\nfrom advertising on UCLU premises\nand from recruiting at the UCL Freshers\u2019 Fair, drawing widespread criticism\nfrom both their own university and the\nMinistry of Defence.\nThe events at UCLU follow similar\nmotions at LSE and Goldsmiths passed\nthis year by their respective unions, and\na contrary motion by ICU made last\nmonth pledging to allow the University of London Officer Training Corps\n(ULOTC), University Royal Naval Unit\n(URNU), and the University of London\nAir Squadron (ULAS) to continue to\nadvertise at the IC Freshers\u2019 Fair. ICU\nPresident, Stephen Brown, also voiced\nhis strong opinion on the matter, calling the actions of UCLU \u201can absolute\ndisgrace\u201d.\nThe UCLU motion justifies their\ncourse of action by stating that: \u201cFor\nthe Union to use its resources to encourage students to join the military or\nparticipate in military recruitment activities at this time would give political\nand material support to the war.\u201d\nThe Union\u2019s reasoning has been criticised by media pundits for suggesting\nthat the military is responsible for foreign policy.\nThe student row has been catapulted\ninto the headlines of the media by the\nrecent events surrounding RAF Wittering\u2019s ban on service members wearing uniform in public.\nThe Telegraph quoted MP and\nformer infantry commander Patrick\nMercer as saying: \u201cThese students are\ndeeply misguided.

Whilst student military organisations are part of the national military reserve, students are exempt from\nnormal rules on active duty, only eligible for call-up in event of a \u201cNational\nEmergency.\u201d In addition to this, they\nare free to leave at any time, are not obligated to join the military, and only a\ntiny percentage of the total number go\non to enter the armed forces either as\na full reserve or as a career. Most seem\nto join these organisations for leadership experience, adventure, and for the\nsmall salary and bonuses that are paid\nfor time spent gaining skills and trying\nout expensive activities.\nOpponents of the organisations\npoint out that the reason for the units\nto exist is primarily as a recruitment\ntool for graduates and highly-skilled\npeople who would not otherwise have\nconsidered a career in the military.\nUCLU also alludes to the recruitment\npolicies (that only UK nationals under 30 may join) that conflict with its\nown equal opportunity policy.

Imperial gallantly declined thus\nleading to a scenario none too different\nto last year. So players and friends from\nthe lacrosse club found an atmosphere\nof rivalry spurred between them as the\nMedics and Imperial team warmed up\non opposite ends of the pitch.\nThe match began and it rapidly became apparent that once again, the\nMedics were due to be thoroughly\ndestroyed, but certainly not without\na good fight. Some spectacular saves\nwere made by the Medics goalie and\ncaptain, Chris Baldwin. Fantastic game\nplay by centre Izzie Brown who had to\ntake on the tall challenge of Jon Downing and superb running by John Jones\nand Joe Bacarese-Hamilton.\nUnfortunately, defence and attack\nwas no match for the Imperial team\nwho crushed the Medics, outrunning\nthem with some superb stick work\nfrom Tim Barber, Ian Hunt, and Florence Slater. Their attack managed to\nperturb even the solid defence of the\nLacrosse Club \u2013 Elsa Butrous and Emily Murray. Consistent commitment\nand enthusiasm led to great performance from James Kerr, Max Holland,\nImperial dominate medic lacrosse\nand Kiran Booth. New Imperial goalie,\nKristian Roberts, showed no fear with\nregular attacks from the Medics team.\nA particular highlight of the match\nwas when Ian Hunt of Imperial dislocated the shoulder of key Medic player\nAkira Fukutomi, resulting in the first\nmajor accident of Varsity requiring the\nassistance of the emergency services\nand an ambulance (he survived!).\nImperial finished the match with a\nstorming victory of 15-3. The Medics dragged their feet to the Imperial\nteam to shake hand. No one could have\nsummed up the match and day better\nthan the Lacrosse Club Mixed Captain,\nChristopher Baldwin who finished\nwith, \u201cI\u2019m just glad we\u2019re all in the same\nteam for the club!\u201d.\nAnd so together we all traipsed over\nto the Harlington Bar and proceeded to\nget suitably drunk with ample amounts\nof Port and Gin consumed by all with\ngreat team spirit!\nThis sea-son, the lacrosse club\nhas grown\nbeyond my\nwildest ex-pectations.\nWe set out to\nput lacrosse\non the map and I believe that\nwe have achieved just that.\nWe differ in many respects to\nmost sports \u2013 boys and girls\ntrain, play, and socialise together \u2013 in fact do everything,\nincluding getting naked for a\ncertain page 3 \u2026 Our small\nbut wonderfully hardcore\ngroup of enthusiastic, committed members along with\nthe help of a fantastic committee have transformed our\nimage.

The game kicked off at 8:20pm,\nand the IC team gained the beginning\nof a constant lead after Sof\u00eda\u2019s 1st bas-ket. However, during the first 5 minutes\nof the first quarter there was not much\nscoring, both teams still warming up.\nNonetheless, IC\u2019s team got more into\nthe game and extended its advantage,\nwhich was of more than 20 points by\nthe end of the quarter; the match had\nalready been decided. Throughout the\nremaining quarters the IC team got\nused to the rivals game and was able\nto play accordingly, their confidence\nbuilding throughout.\nDuring the 2nd and 3rd quarter the\nteam was still not playing at its best\nand struggling to get used to zone defence and the game tactics of the oppo-nent. Nevertheless, there was brilliant\nteam effort and dedication as well as\nwillingness to play a good game which\nled to an excellent performance, especially during the fourth quarter, which\ncan be appreciated by looking at the\nfinal result.\nFurthermore, during the fourth\nquarter a pressure defence was played\nvery successfully, allowing for easy ball\nrecoveries at the opponent\u2019s half court\nwhich resulted in comfortable basket\nscoring. Moreover, as the match developed the defence improved greatly and\nthe ball was recovered easily and very\nfrequently, providing scope for fast\nbreaks to take place.\nSof\u00eda Civeira and Dehydys Pimentel\nwere the top scorers with more than\n20 points each. However, the overall\nwin would not have taken place had it\nnot been for every member\u2019s contribution to the extraordinary final score. A\nstrong defence was played throughout\nthe game, and became the key point\nfor such great an advantage at the end.\nFinally, I would like to thank all the\nsupporters for coming along and congratulate all the team players that took\npart in the game for their enthusiasm\nand performance.\nSara Arb\u00f3s i Torrent\nBasketball\nVarsity\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 96\nMedicals Women\u2019s 1st 8\nThe season\nhas been\namazing for\nthe Women\u2019s\n1st.

It would be Pyman\u2019s first win\non the PGA circuit. But it was neither\nthe Englishman nor the Austrian that\nwas causing the buzz in the sidelines.\nIn attendance and following every shot\nwere Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki\nand erstwhile opposition leader Raila\nOdinga, each completely relaxed and\njovial in the other\u2019s company. Bitter rivals only weeks before, the two laughed\nand joked like old high-school buddies.\nIn an address later on that day, they described the chaos caused by last year\u2019s\ndisputed presidential election as \u201ca\nthing of the past\u201d, saying the country\nwas now on a healing process. For the\nfirst time, President Kibaki referred to\nMr. Odinga as Prime Minister-designate. And significantly, Mr Odinga on\nhis part referred to Mr. Kibaki as \u201cYour\nExcellency\u201d.\nTwoweeksearlier,suchascenewould\nhave been well-nigh unimaginable.\nTalks between the Government and\nOpposition sides seemed to be heading nowhere, with hardliners on either\nside refusing to cede ground to allow\na power-sharing agreement. On February 26, chief mediator Kofi Annan\ncalled off the talks, sensing that President Kibaki and Mr. Odinga were not\nbeing fully informed on the progress\nof the talks by the negotiators they\nhad picked to make their respective\ncases. On February 27, Annan sat both\nleaders down face to face, determined\nthat a solution to the political crisis be\nfound. In attendance at Mr. Annan\u2019s request was Tanzanian President Jakaya\nKikwete, sitting AU chairman, but,\nperhaps more significantly, the Head\nof State of a country where power is\ncurrently shared between the Presidency and the office of a Prime Minister. The speed of the result took even\nKenyans by surprise. On February 28,\nin front of an excited press, Kibaki and\nOdinga signed the historic agreement\nthat would see an end to two months\nof turmoil and uncertainty that had\npushed Kenya to the brink. Under the\nagreement, the President would cede\nsome of his authority to pave the way\nfor the creation of the office of a Prime\nMinister, which Mr Odinga would\nhold. Government positions would be\nsplit 50-50 between the two rival sides,\nand the newly-formed coalition would\nset national reconciliation as a primary objective. Celebrations broke out\nthroughout the country as Kenyans\nfinally found meaning in wishing each\nother a Happy New Year.\nRenewed optimism has swept\nthrough the country since. The fear\ncaused by inter-ethnic tension has begun to dissipate, with each tribe feeling secure and sufficiently represented\nin the new coalition government. The\ncountry\u2019s economic indicators brightened up with news of the deal, with the\nNSE index improving, trading volumes\napproaching pre-election levels, and\nStandard & Poor revising its long term\nrating on Kenya to stable from nega-tive. Although the post-election violence is expected to slow down growth\nthis year, the future looks bright again\nfor East Africa\u2019s biggest economy.\nObservers have called the long term\nsustainability of the deal into question,\nand hardliners from each side continue\nto voice their dissatisfaction at the apparently weak reconciliatory stances\nadopted by their respective sides. But\nthe signs look good, and there is faith\nthat this agreement is one which will\nlast. At the official state opening of Parliament, the President\u2019s address was received by spontaneous foot-thumping\nfrom both sides of the House, a stark\ncontrast to the shouting and name-calling that marred the swearing-in\nceremony weeks before. And in a sign\nof their commitment to making the\ndeal a success, after only six minutes\nof debate, Parliament unanimously approved the appointment of the Committee on House Business, in which\nthe President\u2019s Party of National Unity\nand Mr Odinga\u2019s Orange Democratic\nMovement shared seats equally. \u201cWe\nhave brought Kenya out of the crisis\nbecause we want to see a united nation\nthat has been a haven of peace,\u201d said\nMr Odinga. The President echoed this\nsentiment, calling upon MPs to become \u201cambassadors of peace\u201d in their\ncommunities, and to spare no effort in\nensuring that the violence that gripped\nKenya is not allowed to erupt again.\nThere remains a long and potentially\ntreacherous way to go; extensive legal and social reforms will need to be\nimplemented by Parliament in order\nto address the root causes of the post-election strife. Kibaki and Odinga have\nvoiced their desire to see the process\nthrough, but it will be the courage and\nwill of Kenya\u2019s leaders to place their\ncountry\u2019s interests before their own\nthat will ultimately give Kenyans a\ncountry they can believe in, and a Kenya they can be proud of.\nLeft: Kenyatta Centre in Nairobi. After an historic political agreement, Kenyans can look forward to clear and prosperous times again\nIf you didn\u2019t know where Kenya was before you picked up this issue, now you do.\nAlas, it\u2019s the end of another term. What\nwas my political highlight? Probably\nthe backlash at last week\u2019s article \u2018The\nfacts about the Lisbon Treaty\u2019 by a certain Ian Grieve, calling it \u201cunremittingly pro-EU\u201d. I concede - the subheadings\n(\u2018Will the UK lose its veto?\u2019 and \u2018Is it a\nmajor transfer of power to the EU?\u2019 for\ninstance) were geared towards countering Eurosceptic propoganda. But\naren\u2019t Eurosceptics those people with\nscales and lizard breath who go around\nspreading misleading rumours with\nthe aim of winning Daily Mail reader\nvotes? The answer is yes.\nComing a close second, I guess it\nmust be that election in Pakistan back\nin February which handed victory to\nthe PPP, party of the recently-assas-sinated ex-prime minister Benazir\nBhutto, herself accused of flagrant corruption whilst in office. However, with\nno outright majority, and with a leader\nwho holds no seat himself, the violence\ncontinues amidst the political instabil-ity; 24 killed and many more injured in\na twin suicide attack just last Tuesday.\nOn the topic of that much loved system of government, democracy, Spain\nand Malaysia voted last week, both returning their respective leaders to of-fice, both with reduced majorities. Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, leader of ruling\ncoalition Barisan Nasional, resisted\ncalls to resign after seeing a 90% majority at the last election in the South\nEast Asian country crumble to little\nover 60% this time around. It means\nhe cannot make constitutional changes\nwithout support from the opposition.\nIn local news, Alistair Darling,\nChancellor of the Exchequer, gave his\nfirst budget report last Tuesday, hiking\ntaxes on \u2018gas guzzling\u2019 cars and alco-hol, increasing borrowing and scaling\ndown growth forecasts for the next\n2 years. The shock-haired politician\nblamed the world financial crisis for\nhis woes, as the rescuing of troubled\nbank Northern Rock and rising inflation mar his time at number 11.\nIt\u2019s been in Politics pretty much every week for the past year (+6 months),\nbut the Democratic primaries continue\nin the US. Hillary Clinton left the state\nof Mississippi with days to spare before\nthe polls to campaign in Pennsylvania,\nthe next large state to vote, facing a\nnear certain loss. The loss did indeed\ncome as the state in which 70% of registered Democrat voters are of African\norigin emphatically backed Barack\nObama. In a contest increasingly divided along racial lines, Democrats\nfear their nomination contest could\nharm their chances come November\nand the battle against John McCain.\nSo, a political thought to leave you\nwith over the holiday you\u2019ll likely\nspend in the library? Genocide, a word\nbounced around the tabloids more\nthan Ms Britney Spears herself, is but\nanother tool of war. The real crime is\nour cultural identity. So why not let\u2019s\nput on our rainbow glasses, break\nopen a chocolate Easter egg and give\none another a hug? After all, if we\u2019re\nall the same, there\u2019d be nothing to discriminate against, and hence no mass\nkillings.\nLi-Teck Lau\nPolitics Editor\n\n"

    "content": "IC Women\u2019s 1st dominate medics with style\nWednesday, February 26 \u2013 the day of\nmedic-bashing had finally arrived. The\nIC Ladies 1\u2019s were out in force and\nproved too strong an opposition for\nthe ICSM.\nThe day kicked off with Preying\nMantis turning up late, flirting her way\nonto the bus having still not bought\nher Varsity ticket. Moonie obviously\nhad a lot of pent-up aggression, finding fault with the ACC transportation\nin her usual demure manner. Once at\nHarlington, the girls settled down into\nmatch-mode with Scotty-the-big-hottie handing out some inspiring changing room chat.\nOn the pitch, a poultry medic mascot and a row of hideous scarlet cords\nsported by their Men\u2019s 2\u2019s on the sideline were not enough to distract the\nmighty IC Ladies. Some lovely play-making by Token Lezza and Shoko up\nthe right wing led to an early goal from\nMalvinas in her deadly position on the\nP-spot.\nAs ICSM heads dropped to the floor,\nMoonie took advantage with another\nclassic reverse stick shot. To the medics\u2019 credit they had their fair share of\nchances in the first half, but luckily\nMJ was completely on fire in goal. As\nshe had pointed out before the game\n\u2013 she had a dodgy shoulder, not a\nImperial women\u2019s hockey take the early lead\nThis year\u2019s clash saw IC as the underdogs having played the medics twice\nthis year in the league and losing one\nand drawing the other. The only thing\nleft to do was to win what was probably our most important game of the\nseason.\nNot only did 12 players manage to\nmake it to the union at 10 a.m. but we\nalso had a self-appointed team \u2018manager\u2019 (Fi) and our very own cheerleader\n(El). On the bus on our way to Harlington Alice C and El taught us chants\nborrowed from the RSM to use against\nthe medics and we were slowly getting\nready for the match. To start the match\nwe had our longest ever warm up and\nlooked like a team from the outset.\nHowever, as it was the first match of\nthe day, we were lacking support and\nunfortunately the medics had managed\nto bring theirs with them on the early\ncoach.\nICSM won the toss and started the\ngame off. It was clear from the start\nthat they were going to be using dirty\ntactics as Maria was struck on the knee\nand proceeded to roll around on the\nfloor. As we weren\u2019t organised enough\nto stock up on ice, Alissa had to call the\nunion to ask for some to be brought\nout on the later buses. However Maria\ndecided to man-up and continue play-ing, much to Maddie\u2019s delight on the\nsideline. I don\u2019t really remember what\nhappened from then on as I was too\nworried about what would happen,\nwhether I was going to have a heart attack and what I would do when I finally\ngot my hands on the cup. So the following might not be very accurate.\nICSM managed to dominate play in\nthe first half, pressurising us to play\ndown the middle, causing Mala and\ncaptain Amanda to do a lot of run-ning. We had numerous chances, but it\ntook about twenty minutes before we\nopened the score. All the short corner\npractice finally paid off as Mala pushed\nout to Bella who scored with a beautiful strike on the goal. That quickly shut\nup the medics, including their support\nand especially the chicken that was\nrunning up and down the sideline.\nThis not only calmed our nerves but\nproved to everyone that we were going\nto put up a fight. The medics came back\nhard and kept Mary awake, making\nsome awesome saves. Izzy played fantastically with Sheena, working hard to\nclear the ball away from our D, however just before half time we were struggling and unfortunately let the medics\nclaw one back. The half time whistle\nblew shortly after, during a medic at-tack, and was warmly welcomed.\nWe were privileged enough to have\nhalf-time oranges (brought by Mary,\nleaving Amanda to give hers to the Ladies 1s and Fi to give to the Mens 2s).\nAs team manager I muscled in on the\nhalf-time talk, praising all the fantastic play, probably the best I\u2019ve seen all\nseason, but reminded everyone of the\nneed to mark, especially as the medics\nseemed to like their stick tackles, so we\njust had to keep hold of the ball for as\nlong as possible.\nBy this point the IC support had finally showed up, and the Mens 2s did\nus proud, dishing out as much abuse as\nwe had received in the first half.\nIC came out with a fighting spirit\nand it was elegantly shown in the play.\nWe were working as a team, finally being able to use Jess and Carina on the\nwings as we were no longer forced\ndown the middle. This was aided by\nthe chanting, through a traffic cone,\ndirected at the medics, which included\n\u201cwhat are you hiding under your headband\u201d and \u201cwho ate all the pies\u201d. Maybe\nit was this encouraging support that\nled us to push on again. The medics\nclearly didn\u2019t like this, and took to injuring players to take them out of the\ngame. Maria got hit on the hand and\nhad to be taken off as she couldn\u2019t hold\nthe stick.\nThis forced Maddie onto the pitch\nfor the rest of the game, whilst Maria\ntook full advantage of the ice packs\nthat turned up on the later buses.\nHowever we fought on as a team and\nsome inspiring play let Mala feed the\nball to Amanda who took the ball into\nthe D and scored from open play. The\nnerves were all finally settling for IC\nas we now took the lead. After a while\nlonger, maybe 10 minutes, someone\nwas fouled inside the D, and IC were\nawarded a penalty stroke (not entirely\nsure why, but we think it was because\nthe ball was stopped on the line by a\nfoot, and as we all know that\u2019s just\nplain old cheating). Mala stepped up\nto take this, the pressure was on, and\nsome medic was whining about it,\nbut she got told to pipe down. Unfortunately the pressure got to Mala and\nshe missed, nearly giving me the heart\nattack I was worried about. We had to\nhang on for just 10 minutes longer.\nIC were clearly tiring, and with Maria injured, even though she claimed\nshe could go back on if we taped the\nstick to her hand, we no longer had any\nsubs. ICSM capitalised on this, relent-5\nVarsity Special\nFrancine Oddy\nHockey\nVarsity\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 6\nMedicals Women\u2019s 1st 2\nFiona Jamieson\nHockey\nVarsity\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 2\nMedicals Women\u2019s 1st 1\nlessly attacking the D. At one point\nMary confused everyone by hiding the\nball under her foot and when she finally\ndecided to move Izzy had to launch in\nand steal it from the two medics lurking by the goal. However we weren\u2019t\nalways so skillful and one of the medic\nscum struck on goal and it went in. The\nfirst umpire awarded the goal. Mary\nand our entire defence contested the\ndiscussion (it had clearly hit a medic\u2019s\nfoot on the way in) and the second umpire was consulted, who disallowed the\ngoal. That showed the medics that they\ncouldn\u2019t get away with cheating!\nThe final whistle blew with IC victorious yet again!\ndodgy heart. A shortie goal finally got\nthrough, bringing the scoreline to 2-1.\nIn typical spirit IC fought straight\nback, with Kebab and Womble strong\nas ever in defence feeding the ball up\nto T*tWan* where she hastily got a\nshort corner. A cracking strike from\nCBum was on its way when kicked by\na defender. Penalty Flick. Cue Womble,\nand a certain 3-1. After half-time IC\ndidn\u2019t let up, with another goal apiece\nfor Malvinas and Moonie. A deserved\nmedic goal from a pretty great shot\ninto the top corner brought the score\nto 5-2.\nWhat better end to the most awaited\ngame of the season, than for skipper JD\nto score from mid-D into the bottom\ncorner. An unsurprising MOM was the\nlegendary MJ. 6-2 6-2 6-2: try again\nnext year ICSM.\nRoxy Foulser-Piggott going for goal\nArabella Walker levitating, magic!\n\n"

It is an inherent quality\nof relatively intelligent human beings\nto question what is seemingly impossible to control. Some have been wildly\nsuccessful in this quest. Others\u2026 well,\nwho remembers losers? Regardless\nof which side of the fence one may\nstand on, the one thing that people\nhave been trying their darn hardest\nto do is predict the behaviour of these\nweird collectives of human emotion\nand madness of crowds. While decoding the markets is a full-time job for\nsome people, everyone with access to\nanything resembling the news is aware\nthat there are booms and busts in an\neconomy. This was a postulate first\nput forward by the famed economists\nSchumpeter and Kondratieff. It is hard\nto predict exactly when these elements\nof the never-ending economic cycle\nwill happen, but it\u2019s not tremendously\ndifficult to assign rhyme and reason to\ntheir origins once they have happened.\nUnfortunately, like with most things in\nlife, it seems to be much easier to make\npredictions and prognoses after the\nevent. The most important thing to realise and understand is that crises are\nabsolutely cyclical. In 97 there was the\nAsian currencies crisis; in 2000 we had\nthe speculative Nasdaq bubble burst-ing, and now we are faced with what\nis judged by many to be almost the Armageddon of financial disasters.\nThe financial sector is seen as one of\nthe pillars of modern society as we have\ncome to know and live it. The image it\nprojects is one of something truly stable and solid as a rock. Something almost unshakable, if you will. While this\nis the reality for the great majority of\nthe time, the truth of the matter is that\nthere is probably not a single sector\nmore leveraged than the financial one.\nBanks and other financial institutions\nare leveraged on average 20 times; and\nthis is a conservative estimate. Due to\nthis astronomical leverage, any crisis\nwill have quite catastrophic consequences if it happens to hit non-diver-sified institutions or actually affects all\nsectors of an economy.\nThis so-called \u2018subprime crisis\u2019 is an\nespecially worrying one because it is affecting banks quite heavily. It is hitting\nthe heart of the financial system \u2013 the\ninvestment banks. For the first time in\nover 20 years, a bank going bankrupt\nis not just a mere possibility but rather\na very disturbing probability. Obviously the risk of this happening is still\nrelatively low for two main reasons;\n1) governments and global bodies do\nnot want a run for the money should\na bank fall; and 2) because the extreme\nweakening of some banks or lessening\nscope of their service will only lead to a\nhigher level of concentration in an industry that is far from being dilute.\nThe subprime crisis has led to a massive credit crunch that has affected\neveryone, from you and me to some\nof the most powerful organisations on\nthis planet. No one in the real world is\ncompletely immune from it, no matter\nhow deep the bunker in which one may\nbe hiding. The news goes on about it;\nthe papers go on about it; even your\nwrinkly, old, spinster landlady goes\non about it. And with due reason. The\ninability to borrow capital or properly price any mortgage-backed secu-ritiy has put a massive damper on the\neconomy. This dent is far from being\nmended. In a few years, however, the\ncurrent crisis will undoubtedly fade to\nan almost oblivion and in the process\nwill transform the markets, the revenue model of financial firms and, in-evitably, the fates and lives of millions\nof people who were just watching the\nworld go by.\nThis crisis, like most other economic\nones, is not brought about by computers or by obscure forces. It is the byproduct of something very real \u2013 peo-ple. As long as people are the driving\nforce behind markets, they will continue to be difficult to predict. While patterns of behaviour may be found when\nlooking at the past, the here and now\ntends to be infinitely more complex\nthan anything else. The inevitability of\nhuman nature is an empirical truth.\nI hope the very rudimentary explanation of the current crisis below will help\nyou understand it a little bit better.\nThe ability to obtain credit has greatly diminished since August 2007\nAfter the housing bubble in the US\nburst, risky borrowers of capital\n(those spending beyond their means\nand with a poor credit record) became unable to pay it back.\nAs a result, credit risk retainers\nsuch as banks suffered tremendous\nlosses as borrowers defaulted their\npayments. This was due to somewhat irresponsible lending on their\npart and by offering tempting conditions to those that could not afford\npayments.\nLenders also sold off risk to other investors by creating structured products using these risky \u2018subprime\u2019\nmortgages as the underlying asset.\nBanks were big investors in these\nbacked securities\nAs defaults increased, the value of\nthese securities declined, resulting\nin significant losses for investors in\nthese products.\nStock markets suffered due to the\nuncertainty of the exact amount\nlost and investors of all kinds became more weary. Lenders also became more cautious of lending in\nall forms, resulting in a difficulty to\nobtain credit by all parties.\nInability to borrow expensive loans\nled to unwillingness by businesses to invest large sums of money.\nThese dynamics put heavy brakes\non an economy since consumer\nspending and corporate investment\nare key necessities for growth.\nThe shortest route to the subprime and credit crunch enlightenment\nSTART\nFINISH\n\n"
