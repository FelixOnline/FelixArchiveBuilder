I was already a fan of this\nperiod of art, and was semi-familiar\nwith Duchamp and Man Ray, though\nI\u2019d never heard of Picabia. This is the\nkind of exhibition I go to see even if I\u2019m\nnot writing about it. Not only that, this\nwas my first ever press viewing. I got\nto see the exhibition before it was open\nto the public, when it was open only to\njournalists there to review it.\nGoing to a press viewing was certainly good fun, and a chance I\u2019d jump\nat in the future. Not all the labels had\nbeen transferred to the walls, and there\nwas still the odd workman wandering\naround. It\u2019s quite fun to see the exhibition as a work in progress. Also at press\nviewings, the staff are particularly nice\nto you, because they know you\u2019re there\nto judge them, though I was extremely disappointed by a total lack of free\ncoffee/danish/biscuits/goodie bags.\nI think being a member of the press\nshould entitle me to delicious freeness\n\u2013 you\u2019d think they\u2019d make more of an\neffort to bribe me, really.\nNot that they needed to bribe me,\nbecause this exhibition was very good\nindeed. Something that particularly\nimpressed me about this exhibition is\nhow it displays beautifully the development of art during the period. You get\nto experience and understand the transitions from Impression to Fauvism\nand then on to Dadaism and Surrealism and Modernism\u2026 few exhibitions\nof this type could manage this. It\u2019s an\nexcellent lesson on how artists influence each other and how movements\ncome about. Despite this being a great\nsuccess of the exhibition, it wasn\u2019t\nmade its obvious aim and wasn\u2019t discussed directly. I think they\u2019re missing\nout on an opportunity here. The Tate\nhype suggests what they\u2019re going for\nhere is showing the relationships between the lives and works of the three,\nand how they influenced eachother. I\ndon\u2019t come away feeling this has been\nachieved, compared with the Matisse/\nPicasso exhibition of a few years ago,\nwhich worked along the same lines\n(this remains in my mind as the best\nexhibition I have ever experienced, and\nwill be a tough one to beat).\nSo, the exhibition centres on three\nartists: Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968),\nMan Ray (1890-1976) and Francis Picabia (1879-1953). These three friends\nhad significant influence on the progression of modern art, including the\ncreation of the Dada movement. Walking round the exhibition you can easily\nfind the parallels between their work,\nbut there are also obvious differences.\nDuchamp started out as a painter but\nlater moved into more unusual media (like urinals), though for many\nyears he was thought to have given\nup art to play competitive chess (who\nwouldn\u2019t?). Picabia was a painter all his\nlife, while Man Ray dabbled in different media including photography. In\ncase you wondered, which I did, Man\nRay\u2019s real name was Emmanuel Radnitzky. He was doing me a favour there\n\u2013 I don\u2019t think I want to spend the rest\nof this article having to type that out\nover and over again. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to keep track of which is which,\nbut Picabia strikes me as being sinister and somewhat of a smug, dirty old\nman. Duchamp is possibly the most\nwell-known, and comes off as the ringleader of the \u201cgroup\u201d. Man Ray is the\none that consistently appeals to me the\nmost \u2013 his character is more mysteri-ous, but I generally prefer his art to the\nother two.\nFrom the first room, you come to appreciate they were a chummy bunch.\nFor a start, they liked taking photographs of eachother. \u201cFrancis Picabia\nBehind the Wheel of His Car\u201d by Man\nRay is a case in point. The description\nsays \u201cthey shared a love of fast cars and\nthe good life, and often went to the\nsouth of France together\u201d, which is a\nfair first impression to have of them. In\nfact, the labels and descriptions in the\nexhibition frequently amuse me, describing the antics the three got up to. I\nenjoy how their little anecdotal stories\nare worked in, though I\u2019m not sure this\nwas a deliberate aim of the narrative.\n\u201cAdam and Eve\u201d by Picabia in the second room suggests this is going to turn\ninto another sex, drugs and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\narticle. It doesn\u2019t dominate (which is a\nrelief \u2013 I\u2019m bored of writing about it),\nbut sex and nudity come up again and\nagain in this exhibition. I will say this\nabout Picabia: the dude knew how to\ndraw a good scrotum.\nNot all of the art I like. Room three\nhas some beastly stuff in it. \u201cNude\nDescending a Staircase\u201d by Duchamp\nis supposed to have caused scandal\namongst the art-appreciating public of\nthe time, being revolutionary and in-fluential. I think it\u2019s fairly awful myself\n- a flurry of sketchy lines and brown.\n\u201cBride\u201d by Duchamp, next to it, is even\nworse, with more brown mixed with\nunsettling fleshy tones. On the opposite wall, \u201cCut-Out\u201d by Man Ray is\nsomewhat better. I\u2019m a big fan of crisp\nlines and simple shapes. Man Ray is\nwinning me over already.\nI quite like how all three have a tendency to write the titles of the paintings on the paintings, as in \u201cThe Rope\nDancer Accompanies Herself With\nHer Shadows\u201d by Man Ray. He has excellent handwriting, all swirly and ar-tistic. Picabia\u2019s handwriting (see \u201cI See\nAgain in Memory My Dear Udnie\u201d) is\nmuch less nice: the block capitals of an\nover-determined eight year old.\nFountain by Marcel Duchamp 1917.

A recent study, led by Yvon\nLe Maho from the Institut Hubert\nCurien in Strasbourg, tracked 456 individual penguins over a nine year\nperiod and found that even a small increase in temperature, reflecting existing climate change predictions, poses\nan enormous danger and significant\nextinction risk for these charismatic\ncreatures. The results were published\nin the February 11th issue of PNAS.\nMany consider climate change to\nbe the most significant environmental challenge facing mankind at this\nmoment in time. Its effects include\nextreme weather patterns, rising sea\nlevels and in some areas a reduction\nin food resources. Importantly, Earth\u2019s\nwarming patterns are strongest in polar regions, where temperatures have\nrisen five times faster than the global\naverage over the past 50 years. It\u2019s this\nwarming which makes climate change\nas much of a challenge for penguins as\nmankind.\nPenguins are marine predators, positioned at the top of the Antarctic food\nchain. Studying their population dynamics can reflect the evolution of marine supplies such as krill, which nestle\nat the bottom of the food chain. The\nadult penguins swim to and from their\ncolony to collect food for themselves\nand their offspring, with the distance\ntravelled being directly correlated with\nthe temperature of the ocean surface.\nOrganisms at the low trophic levels\n(further down in the food chain) are\nonly able to thrive at a narrow temperature range. The warmer the surface of\nthe water, the less marine life there is\nclose to the colony and hence the further the penguins have to go in order\nto fish. During the summer months,\nthe penguins have been seen to travel\nbetween 300-600 km away from the\ncolony, as the warmer Southern Ocean\nsea surface has hindered the development of marine life forms near the\ncolony.\nCounterintuitively, this warming\ndoesn\u2019t only occur in the summer:\nduring the winter period, the ocean\nsurface temperature has been shown\nto increase by around 0.26\u00b0C, which\nleads to a population collapse of marine organisms then too, explaining\nwhy the King Penguins have been seen\nto travel up to 2000 km away during\nthis period.\nUnsuprisingly, as well as a decrease\nin marine life forms, warmer Southern\nOcean sea surface temperatures are\nalso connected with an abrupt decline\nin the penguin population\u2019s reproductive success. With less food available\nfor consumption and to bring back\nto the young, the little chicks have an\nabridged likelihood of survival. Using the data collected, a mathematical\nmodel was produced, which was used\nto predict a subsequent 9% drop in the\npenguin\u2019s survival two years later. The\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange has predicted that Earth will\nwarm by 0.2\u00b0C per decade for the next\ntwo decades \u2013 the threat to the penguin\npopulation can clearly be inferred.\nThe investigation was carried out on\nthe sub Antarctic species, Aptenodytes\npatagonicus, found on Possession Island in the Crozet Archipelago, located in the southern Indian Ocean. It is\nin this area where around two-thirds\nof the world\u2019s King Penguin population\nreproduce, a staggering two million\nbirds.\nThe penguins were monitored in\ntheir natural environment via electronic tags, which were implanted under their skin. Maho and his colleagues\nwere the first group to carry out this\nmethod of research; past studies used\nnumbered rings attached to each bird\u2019s\nwing.However, this method of tracking was shown to hinder the penguin\u2019s\nswimming ability. Furthermore, penguins fitted with these rings have been\nshown to have a reduction in reproductive success and life expectancy.\nIn contrast, fitting the birds with the\nelectronic tags was shown to have no\nimpact on how they go about their\ndaily life.\nThis key study not only reflects the\neffect of global warming on biodiversity but importantly its additional wider\neffect on marine food chains, which\ncan lead to an imbalance of organisms\nthroughout the trophic levels.\nThe penguin population has limited\noptions, with an increase in the temperature of the ocean sea surface being inevitable. Will they adapt to the\nchanging global environment and sur-vive? Or will they fall as a defenseless\nvictim of climate change?\nKing Penguins. Emperor Penguins may go on marches, but these little\ncritters are swimmers, making epic foraging journeys of up to 2000 km\nClimate change puts king penguins in hot water\nIt\u2019s often said that men don\u2019t ask for\ndirections and women never forget a\nface. Hackneyed though they are, it\u2019s\nstarting to look like these stereotypes\nmight have a biological basis\nPsychologists Agneta Herlitz and\nJenny Rehnman from the Karolinska\nInstitute in Stockholm, Sweden, have\nbeen investigating the accuracy of\nthese age-old anecdotes. According to\ntheir research, women and men have\ndifferent strengths when it comes to\nmemory, with women coming out on\ntop. Their findings were published\nyesterday in Current Directions in Psychological Science.\nBy testing the recall of groups of men\nand women, Dr Herlitz and Dr Rehnman showed that women excel at remembering words, odours and faces,\nwhile men are better at tasks requiring\ngood spatial awareness, like remembering the route out of a maze.\nThe key difference here is women\u2019s\nsuperior verbal processing abilities.\nWhen verbal information is available,\nwomen gain the upper hand. So, while\nmen might be better at finding their\nway back out of a forest, women would\nbe better at finding their way back to\nthe hotel in a foreign city, where more\neasily verbalised information would be\navailable. Although, presumably, this\nwould be less of a problem for women\nanyway, with their ability to ask for\ndirections.\nThis tendency to verbalise information also puts women in the lead when\nit comes to remembering where the\ncar keys are\u2014a task that requires both\nverbal and visuospatial skills. Where\nmen rely on their spatial awareness,\nwomen use words to remember an object\u2019s position. And it\u2019s not just inanimate objects that women are better at\nremembering.\nIt is well know among psychologists\nthat women are better than men at\nrecognising faces. Dr Herlitz and Dr\nRehnman wondered if perhaps women\nrecognised faces by verbalising them\u2014\nmentally filing descriptions of people,\nsuch as \u2018blonde, blue-eyed, and handsome\u2019. Their experiments didn\u2019t answer their question, but they did reveal\nsomething even more intriguing: women remember the faces of other women\nbetter than those of other men.\nTo investigate further, the researchers showed three groups of men and\nwomen a series of androgynous faces.\nThe images were presented to the first\ngroup as \u2018female faces\u2019, to the second\ngroup as \u2018male faces\u2019, and to the third\ngroup as simply \u2018faces\u2019. The women\nremembered the faces best when they\nwere presented as female faces, whereas this information made no difference\nto the men. This indicated that the\nwomen were remembering the female\nfaces better because they were paying\nmore attention to them.\nResearch in young children has\nshown that both girls and boys can categorise female faces better than male\nfaces. This makes sense if you consider\nthat babies tend to see more female\nfaces at an early age, a fact that the\nresearchers suggest could account for\nthis effect in grown women.\nOver time, interactions with other\ngirls would strengthen this ability in\nwomen, while growing boys would\nlose their advantage through interacting predominantly with other boys, or\nso the theory goes.\nComplicated processes like memory\nare determined by environmental fac-Forget-me-nots should be the official flower for Mother's day. Did you remember this year?\ntors as well as gender. These gender-specific memory differences are seen\nall over the world, but the magnitude\nof difference varies according to social\nand cultural factors.\nThese results offer an intriguing insight into the truth behind the anecdotal reports of men\u2019s failure to remember people they\u2019ve met or where they\nleft things. However, the researchers\nstress that more research is required\nbefore we can fully understand the\nbiological and evolutionary origins of\nthese observations.\nIn the meantime, these finding might\nserve as a useful excuse for forgetful\nmen as well as those reluctant to ask\nfor directions, preferring instead to\nrely on their visuospatial processing.\nNow, where did I put those car keys\u2026\nTamsin Osborne\nTotal recall?

Twenty minutes into the journey, the woman\nnext to me asked me what I was\nreading. I showed her the cover. \u201cVanity Fair,\u201d she said, \u201cisn\u2019t that a woman\u2019s\nmagazine?\u201d I replied no, and so she\nasked \u201cso what actually is it then?\u201d\nGo to any good newsstand and more\nthananything,youwillbeoverwhelmed\nby decisions. I didn\u2019t know that enough\npeople in the world existed to warrant\nseveral titles on truck racing, and the\nBorders on Oxford Street is a veritable\nRipley\u2019s Believe It or Not! of discovery.\nSandwiched somewhere between GQ\nand Vogue lies Vanity Fair, though in\nreality its real home would be sat between the titles of The New Yorker and\nHello!\nVanity Fair is a complex beast. Part\nserious journalistic enterprise, part\nstyle bible and part altar of celebrity\nworship, its niche is difficult to pin\ndown. In a word, it is unique. Unique\nnot only for its innovative and revealing journalism, its rich heritage of literary excellence in showcasing works\nfrom new writers and its acerbic, intelligent style, but also for its persona-defining photography and wonderland\nof imagery.\nThe title was launched by Cond\u00e9\nNast in 1913, coinciding with the juggernaut of modernism, the dawning of\nthe jazz age and the public\u2019s first taste\nof the avant-garde. The magazine was\nsoon competing with The New Yorker\nfor the title of the city\u2019s greatest culture journal. Towards the latter end\nof the decade, the magazine achieved\ngreat popularity and attracted the\ngreat and the good, featuring writers as diverse as T.S.Eliot, Gertrude\nStein, Aldous Huxley, Thomas Wolfe\nand P.G.Wodehouse, and included\namongst its regular staff one Dorothy\nParker. Even today, it is known for its\nsensitive and revealing journalism \u2013\nthe identity of \u201cDeep Throat\u201d, a source\nin the Watergate scandal, was revealed\nin a 2005 issue, while the actress Teri\nHatcher used it to admit being subjected to abuse as a child.\nA victim of the Depression, it folded\nin 1936 before its relaunch in 1983. As\nphotography took the reins of portraiture from paintings in the 20th century,\nthis is reflected in the magazine, and in\nthe walls of a single large space in the\nNational Portrait Gallery studded with\nthe great and the good. The first rows\nof photographs to your immediate left\nas you enter chronicle the magazine\u2019s\nfirst incarnation, while the remainder\nchart the modern equivalent.\nThe black and whites in the first\nsection are an inspiring collection.\nLegitimately great, they are littered\nwith such names as Monet, Einstein,\nPicasso, Joyce and Stravinsky. This\nbarely gets beyond the surface. Also\nrecognised are athletes \u2013 Jesse Owens\nstrikes a pose while Babe Ruth cradles\nhis slugger like a newborn. Louis Armstrong wipes the sweat from his cheek\nwhile Virginia Woolf lazily glances into\nMaurice Beck and Helen MacGregor\u2019s\nlens. Many of the early photographers\nwere also recognised in their own right\n\u2013 Edward Steichen\u2019s portrait of Anna\nMay Wong, the first Chinese actress\nto feature in a Hollywood film, is up in\nall its husky, repressed glory while the\nnumber of pictures by renowned portrait photographer Baron de Meyer are\ninnumerable.\nWhen we segue into the modern\nera, it becomes all too familiar. The realisation is instantaneous. It is obvious\nenough when you are there, and anyone\nfamiliar with the magazines\u2019 famous\ncovers will commiserate. Is this exhibition one with something important to\nrecognise, or is it little more than the\nglorification of celebrity culture? Most\nreviewers have already lambasted it for\nthe latter, pointing out that the Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen stark\nnaked astride a pale grey steed is neither a) art nor b) intellectually justifiable by sane parameters.\nAfter all, it\u2019s the obvious thing to do\nisn\u2019t it? Despite the industry accolades,\nthe prestige of working for the title and\nits legitimate content, it\u2019s still pap non-sense, isn\u2019t it?\nWell, yes and no. On the one hand,\nwe have the best of the last hundred-odd years \u2013 the political heavyweights,\nthe artists and tastemakers, writers and\ncritics who have all helped to shape the\nway we think and see the world. On the\nother, we have a hackneyed and superficial collection of glorified would-be\nachievers. Of course, no one would say\nthat of the truly great talents included,\nbut between these, who has heard of\nthe remaining assortment of society\ntypes and artists? There seems to be a\nheady divide between the magazine\u2019s\nfirst run, and its eighties revival. And\nwhile few would dispute the importance of the figures included in the\nformer, almost without exception the\nmajority disparage the modern images,\nglossy and buffed to digital perfection.\nThe period surrounding the 1920s\nand 1930s were an exciting time of\nchange. Bebop and the blues were\ngaining footholds in the clubs and irreversibly reshaping the musical ver-nacular, the United States introduced a\nlittle thing called consumerism and not\nleast of all modernism, with its powerful engine of change and progressive\noutlook, recalibrated the thinking and\nactions of a myriad of disciplines from\ncommerce to philosophy. Vanity Fair\nback then was a reflection of the best of\nthis, as it is now. The communication\nnetworks were relatively infantile and\nthe mass media didn\u2019t exist, and no one\nwould have even considered globalisation a foreseeable reality. The notion of\n\u201ccelebrity\u201d was a comparative scarcity\nand reserved only for those who warranted the limited run of space in the\nmedia at the time.\nThe sheer amount of exchange and\ncommunication between today\u2019s media\nand the public has made the modern\nnotion of celebrity a commodity for\ncommercial consumption. And as the\npublication in the early half of the century helped convey the massive changes in ideology and thought at the time,\nso too does its modern equivalent for\nthe current state of affairs. These are\nvacuous times and where better than\nVanity Fair to reflect on the notion of\ncelebrity and its trappings? After all \u2013\nif the eighties were defined by greed,\nthe nineties by communication and\nthe noughties by celebrity, it\u2019s hardly\ngoing to translate into something\ndeeply meaningful in an era-defining\nmagazine, is it? Granted, many of the\npouts and arrogant, narcissistic group\nportraits (described as \u201c[supernovas]\nof celebrity\u201d) are hardly modest an-nouncements. For those in the public\neye, to garner an Annie Liebovitz portrait in Vanity Fair is to signal that you\nhave arrived, and increasingly, success\nis a benchmark that few are inclined\nto play down. But it isn\u2019t meant to be\ntimid or soft-spoken. Nothing now is\nabout being either, and the magazine\u2019s\nportraiture does a terrifyingly accurate\njob of depicting this.\nThere is a \u201cportrait\u201d of Faye Dunaway constructed and shot by David\nLaChappelle, modern photography\u2019s\ngreatest advocate of maximalism. Seen\nfrom above, she is draped euphorically\nacross a yellow New York taxi as a baying technicolour mob of fans, press and\npaparazzi savage her and feast upon\nher public image, a golden Academy\nAward statuette drifting haphazardly\nin the crowd like a child lost in the\nfront rows of a Black Sabbath concert.\nThe scene is arresting, unashamedly\nattention grabbing and uncaringly self-serving. And if that isn\u2019t a reflection of\nour time, then what is?\nOne of the more deserving celebrities: Dame Helen Mirren by Lord Snowdon, 1995\nHilary Swank by Norman Jean Roy, 1995. A physique even Wonder Woman would be jealous of\n\n"

Not only can it enter the human body via the skin, or through the\ndigestive system, but also via the lungs\n\u2013 unusually for a bacterium, anthrax\ncan create spores, able to survive for\nvery long times outside a host, turning\nback into bacteria when they re-enter.\nIf enough of these spores are inhaled,\npulmonary anthrax, a particularly fatal\nform of the disease, can develop. Coupled with the ease with which airborne\nspores can be dispersed, these characteristics make \"weaponised\" anthrax a\nformidable biological weapon, capable\nof rendering infected areas uninhabitable for decades.\nWhat the bacteria\ndo inside the\nbody is no less\nsordid. As\nthey travel\nfrom the infection site,\nthey emit a\ntoxic three-part\ncocktail of proteins,\none part of which, the protective antigen, is able to help the\nother two parts \u2013 the lethal and oedema factors \u2013 inside cells, where they\ncan wreak havoc.\nNot only does this allow the bacteria to ward off attempts by the body's\nforce of \"cleaner\" phagocyte cells to\ndestroy them, but recent studies have\nalso shown that a combination of the\nlethal factor and the antigen, known\nas lethal toxin (LeTx) is responsible\nfor typical anthrax symptoms such as\nblood-vessel leakages and the build-up\nof fluid surrounding the lungs.\nIt's the details of how LeTx causes\nblood vessels to leak which Robert E.\nBolcome III and other colleagues from\nthe Harvard Medical School set out to\ninvestigate. As reported recently in the\nProceedings of the National Academy\nof Sciences, one of the problems they\nhad to overcome lay in finding a suitable \"model\" \u2013 mammal blood-vessels\nare buried within\nopaque tissues, preventing the effect\nof the toxin on live vessels from being\nmonitored over time. Observations\nVein melter: Anthrax and zebrafish embryos\nMonitoring what anthrax does to zebrafish veins might help improve treatments for the disease in humans\ncan only be made via dissections, preventing successive measurements on\nthe same animal.\nZebrafish embryos, however, are\ntransparent, and so it is possible to\nmonitor the blood flow in\ntheir vessels without resorting to invasive techniques \u2013 it can be done\nremotely, using\nfluorescence mi-croscopy. This\nrelies on injecting\nfluorescent polymer microspheres\na few hundred nanometres wide into the embryos' vessels \u2013\nwhen il-luminated, these\nmicrospheres show up as\nbright spots in images of the embryos,\nspots whose progress can be followed\nover time without killing the fish.\nUsing this technique on two day-Edmund Henley\nScience Editor\nold zebrafish\nembryos, the researchers were\nable to show that\nLeTx caused three\ntypes of reaction\nin the fish, each reaction class being defined by the circulation present\n20 hours after the toxin was injected.\n\"Wild-type\" cases had normal circula-tion, mild cases showed reduced cir-culation, whilst severe cases had no\ncirculation at all.\nMonitoring the\nprogress of embryos over\ntime, the researchers found this reduction in circulation was associated\nwith leaking vessel walls \u2013 almost all\nembryos with poor circulation showed\nmicrospheres escaping the vessels.\nHowever, using acridine orange, a\ndye which allows living and dead cells\nto be distinguished, it was seen that\nthese leakages occurred without\nthe cells which make up the vessel walls dying \u2013 something else\nwas responsible for the leaks.\nThe culprit turned out\nto be particular chemical\npathway, known to be implicated in vessel permeability. By\nblocking this VEGFR pathway,\nthe researchers were able to\nreduce the numbers of embryos in the mild and severe\ncategories.\nThis suggests that the\nVEGFR pathway is worth exploring further \u2013 the scientists conclude that targeting\nthis pathway may increase\nthe effectiveness of anthrax\ntreatments in humans. Furthermore, as vessel leakage\noccurs in a number of\nother diseases, such as\nEbola or haemorrhagic\nfever, they suggest similar studies would be\nworth pursuing in\nthose cases \u2013 understanding the\nrole vessels play\nmay in fact yield a rich\nvein of techniques for tackling these\nafflictions. Enough to make it worth\nturning any number of zebrafish green\naround the gills.\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFriday 7 March 2008 felix\nPolitics\nApparently\nwar is\nawesome...\nT\nhis last week has seen a\nstring of anti-war and pacifist groups disband and\nrenounce their views. It is\nan unprecedented time of\nself-criticism and re-evaluation in the\nhippie community. Among the groups\nthat have broken up are Imperial soci-ties such as Student Respect and Stop\nthe War.\nThe dramatic u-turn has been attributed to the return of Prince Harry\nfrom active-duty in Afghanistan and\nthe media coverage that has accompanied it. The end of the voluntary media\nblackout has meant that the details of\nPrince Harry\u2019s deployment have been\nreleased. There are many pictures of\nhim, looking happy and having a great\ntime, while the Prince himself has\nspoken of the pride he felt serving his\ncountry and his enthusiasm for serving\non the front line. Leroy Weatherfield,\nformer Chairman of the Stop-the-War\nsociety, spoke of his initial confusion\n\u201cAll this time we\u2019ve been saying that\nwar is fundamentally wrong and un-ethical. We thought that life was terrible for our soldiers. We couldn\u2019t see\nany good in war, but Prince Harry has\nopened our eyes. War doesn\u2019t damage\nthe mental health of soldiers. We can\nsee now that war is not only enjoyable\nbut in a time when obesity rates are in-creasing, an invaluable source of outdoor exercise\u201d.\nThe whole affair has been a massive PR coup for the military. Young,\nfresh-faced boys are signing up for the\nkilling fields in droves since news of\nPrince Harry\u2019s deployment broke. \u201cAll\nthe information about war is usually\nnegative. I\u2019ve read about the horrors of\nfighting and the horrible injuries people sustain. Prince Harry has shown us\nthat war is actually great fun and now\nI really want to go to Afghanistan\u201d said\na naive young boy in the recruitment\nlines. Pro-War groups such as War-isSex and Jingoists-hate-Muslims have\nbeen rejoicing in their victory against\n\u2018delusional\u2019 pacifists. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to tell them all this time that war is\ngreat. We\u2019ve invited them to the range\nto see what its like to shoot an Arab,\nbut I guess it would take a Prince to\nmake them see sense\u201d commented Billy O\u2019Reilly, head of the pro-war Braindead-Hick organisation.\nHowever, their celebrations may be\na little premature. Only a minority of\nanti-war groups have lost their faith.\nOthers are angry that Prince Harry\ndidn\u2019t get himself killed. I spoke to an\naged anti-war protestor \u201cHe\u2019s acted\ncompletely irresponsibly. The Prince is\nmeant to be a role-model to children.\nBy coming home alive and well, he\u2019s\nset an extremely bad example. Kids out\nthere are going to think you can go to\nwar, it\u2019ll be great fun and you\u2019ll come\nback a hero. He should have done the\nright thing and shot himself. At the\nvery least he could have stood on a\nlandmine\u201d.\nSamuel Black\nPolitical Know-It-All\nshall contribute actively to the good\nfunctioning of the Union\u201d. Some British MPs objected to this as it appears\nto be an order. However, the new treaty\ncannot force governments to involve\nthemselves but it is an attempt to help\nbring the EU in the right direction,\nwith more integration between member states and the EU institutions.\nWill the Charter of Fundamental\nHuman Rights affect UK law?\nThe Charter of Fundamental Human\nRights was agreed in 2000 as a declaration and as such is not legally bind-ing. The Lisbon Treaty will correct this\nand make the Charter legally binding.\nSome say this will allow the European\nCourt to rewrite national laws in social\nmatters such as strikes, social security\nand working hours. Some European\nCourt judges believe this is how the\nsystem should work and they may have\na good point. It would help maximise\nthe integration between the different\ncountries and as movement of labour\nis free within the EU, why shouldn\u2019t\nother aspects of work or social matters be universal? If this is the case, it\nis certain the European Court will not\nintervene beyond what the member\nstates feel is acceptable as the EU is\nanswerable to the states. Some people\nbelieve that the Charter is only applicable when countries apply EU law.\nThere is a lot of debate over which is\nthe proper interpretation of the Treaty.\nMost social legislation is national so\ngovernments would be safe from prosecution and intervention. As a guar-antee, Britain has negotiated a clause\nwhich says no court can rule that the\n\u201claws, regulations or administrative\nprovisions, practices or action\u201d of the\nUK are inconsistent with the principles\nlaid down in the charter. Many MEPs\nare unhappy with this legally-binding\nclause as it flies in the face of the underlying principle that EU law should\nbe the same for all member countries.\nThis clause introduced by Britain\nshows a certain amount of disrespect\nfor Europe and our neighbours.\nIs it a major transfer of power to\nthe EU?\nIt transfers some power to the EU but\nnot very much; it is certainly not a major transfer. Many see the Treaty as one\nmore step in the EU\u2019s pursuit of \u201cever\ncloser union\u201d and not a particularly\ndramatic one, certainly compared to\nthe Sin- gle European Act or\nMaas- trichtTreaty,two\nground- breaking\nagree- ments. Many\nMEPs feel that the\nTreaty has been\nwatered down\ntoo much and there\nis not enough substance there to lead\nto more integration.\nOpponents will say\nthat many politicians\nsee the Lisbon Treaty\nas a stepping stone to an\nEU Constitution. However,\nthe constitution itself was not as big a\nstep as it was made out to be; the most\nimportant difference between it and\nany other treaty was that it brought\ntogether all the foundational treaties\ninto one document instead of amending them. The new positions created of\nPresident and High Representative are\nstill answerable to the member states.\nThe EU is a very complex organisation and changes that strengthen it do\nnot necessarily weaken the individual\ngovernments.\nWill the UK lose its veto?\nIn some areas, yes. However, this is not\nnecessarily a bad thing. With increasing membership it becomes harder to\nmake decisions if all votes have to be\nunanimous. Many areas will still have\nunanimous voting and therefore the\nUK will keep its veto. By introducing\nmajority voting, the member states are\npooling sovereignty, encouraging co-operation. The most important place\nwhere unanimity has been lost is in\nthe area of Justice and Home Affairs.\nPolice and judicial cooperation of\nmember states will now be decided by a majority vote\nas immigration, asylum and some other policies already are. However, Britain has negotiated the right to pick and\nchoose whether to take part in Justice\nand Home Affairs legislation.\nWill the European Court get new\npowers?\nYes, its mandate will spread into new\nareas. The European Court of Justice will be able to rule on more cases\nconcerning Justice and Home Affairs.\nHowever, for Britain, only those areas\nwe choose to sign up to can be under\nthe European Court\u2019s jurisdiction so\nthis will have only a limited and unimportant effect on this country.\nWill we lose our commissioner?\nOnly some of the time. Currently each\nmember state has one commissioner and it was not\nso long ago that the\nlarger states had two.\nThe Treaty states\nthat each country\nwill lose their commissioner for five\nyears at a time. From\n2014onlytwothirdsof\nall member states will\nhave a commissioner at\nany one time and the seats\nwill be assigned by rotation\nevery 5 years. However, this is\nbased upon there being 27 mem-bers; if more states join the EU, the\nlength of time will change accordingly.\nIs it Macedonia or not?\nA few years ago I was reading an article\nin TIME magazine about the Balkans.\nThey had printed a map of the region\nfollowing the division of Yugoslavia\nand had labelled the country north of\nGreece as Macedonia. I was only fifteen years old but old enough to know\nthe difference and why that name was\nproblematic. I wrote to the magazine\nexplaining the history of the region\nand explaining why the printing of this\nmap was irresponsible.\nThe letter was never published,\nprobably because it was too long (it is\nafter all 2500 years worth of history!),\nand instead I received a little postcard\nthanking me for my feedback. Eight\nyears later, the issue is back in the\nheadlines and for many people I suspect the answer is quite straightforward and simple and they have little\nunderstanding of what the big deal is. I\nunderstand that writing a whole article\nabout the history of a region with such\na long history is somewhat controversial so I have decided to simply give\na quick overview of some facts that\nhighlight the most important facets of\nthe debate.\nWhen Yugoslavia collapsed, it was\ndivided into Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nCroatia, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro and FYROM (Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia). The name of\nthis last was provisionally accepted in\nthe UN with the understanding that it\nwould form the basis for dialogue and\nmutual agreement between FYROM\nand Greece. This at the time led to a\nvery strong conflict with Greece, which\nhas a Northern province known as\nMacedonia. At the same time Greece\nplaced an embargo against FYROM,\nsince it tried to claim the name \u201cRepublic of Macedonia\u201d and to adopt the\nsun of Vergina, the symbol of Philip\u2019s\n(Alexander the Great\u2019s father) dynasty,\nDanai T Balfoussia for its flag. Today, some countries, including the US and the UK, have fully\nrecognized the name Macedonia, while\nothers, including France, Germany,\nSpain and Australia, continue to refer\nto it as FYROM. With FYROM wanting to join the European Union and\nNATO, the issue of the naming has resurfaced officially.\nMatthew Nimetz, the UN Special\nRepresentative, is currently overseeing\nnegotiations between the two countries\nin an effort to reach a mutually acceptable name. The main difference this\ntime around is that over the past eight\nyears FYROM has led a discreet yet\nrelentless campaign, and has gradually\nintroduced the concept of \u201cMacedonia\u201d as an acceptable name. It casually\nappears in maps, such as in February\n22nd\u2019s issue of the Felix, in journals\nand even political conversations implying that there is no issue, that there\nis no debate. The truth, however, still\nremains that the official UN-recognised name of the country is Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and\nthat there is an issue, a very important\none which if not managed delicately\ncan lead to the destabilization of the\nBalkan region.\nWhat is the relationship between\nAlexander the Great\u2019s Macedonia\nand the region?\nAlexander\u2019s Macedonia (4th century\nBC) was vast and encompassed both\nthe province in Northern Greece as\nwell as less than half of what is today\nFYROM. Its capital, Pella, is within the\nborders of modern Greece as shown\nby archaeological digs. Furthermore,\nAlexander\u2019s Macedonia was a Greek\ncity-state, as were Athens and Sparta.\nAlexander spoke Greek and believed in\nthe twelve Gods of Olympus and also\nparticipated in the Olympic Games, an\nhonour allowed only to Greeks. Modern FYROM by contrast is inhabited by\nSlavs who descended into the region in\n600AD and the languages spoken are\nprincipally a Slav dialect closely related\nto Bulgarian, as well as Albanian, Romani, Turkish and Serbian.\nWhy not just name the country\nMacedonia?\nNaming the country Macedonia implies some sort of tie to Alexander\nthe Great and the cultural heritage of\nthe region. The effort on FYROM\u2019s\nbehalf to use the sun of Vergina in its\nflag further supports the legitimacy of\nthis concern. This name is made even\nfurther unacceptable because of the\naverage person\u2019s inability to distinguish the two. For a person who has\nlittle knowledge of the history of the\nregion, an area named Macedonia implies a direct link to the ancient Macedonians. A final and much more grave\nconcern is the well-founded suspicion\nthat recognition of FYROM as simply \u201cMacedonia\u201d will lay the groundwork for a future claim to the Greek\nprovince of Macedonia. This has the\nultimate goal of achieving direct access to the Aegean sea eliminating in\nthis way any dependence on Greece as\nwell as fulfilling the long-established\ndream of \u201cGreat Macedonia\u201d which\ntoday encompasses parts of Greece,\nBulgaria, Albania and Serbia. While\nthis scenario may appear far-fetched,\nthe current situation in neighbouring\ncountries proves the opposite. With\nthe continual re-definition of the Balkan countries\u2019 borders and the recent\nindependence of Kosovo, who is to say\nthat more changes will not ensue?\nI hope this article has been useful\nand I look forward to answering any\nquestions or addressing any issues in\nmore detail to the best of my knowl-edge. I hope people will gradually show\nmore interest in the issue, read around\nit and form an opinion. The subject of\nMacedonia is not simple or straightforward and failure to recognise the\npolitical implications surrounding the\ndebate will have serious repercussions\non the future of the region. History is\ncrucial to a thorough understanding of\npolitics. When the international community intervened in the region and\ncarved out the post-Yugoslavia bor-ders, history was one thing that was not\ntaken into account. The consequences\nof this omission are evident today.\nBlue: FYROM or Macedonia, Purple: Greek province of Macedonia\n\n"

A poor kick from\nCSM saw the first scrum of the game\non the half way line. Historically, the\nCSM have had dominant forwards,\nhowever, a clean pick up from Flannan O\u2019Mahony caught Camborne off\nguard. A short pop to Rob Phillipps set\nhim carving up the defence, followed\nby a chip and chase. The perfectly\nplaced kick slowed just over the line,\nPhillipps following all the way to make\nthe grounding; 5-0 to RSM after 30\nseconds of play. Understandably CSM\ndid not take kindly to this and came\nback strong, running their forwards\nphase after phase into the RSM pack.\nCamborne were kept at bay with big\ntackles (the only type seen in the Bottle Match) from the second rows, Ben\nMoorehouse and Stephen MacAttack.\nKeeping discipline, the RSM waited\nfor the opposition to make mistakes,\nfollowed by precision kicks from the\nRSM fly half to relieve pressure. A\nslow kick from CSM number 10 was\ncharged down by Joe Brown, with their\nfull back unable to retrieve it, Brown\nhacked it through once more, collected\nand scored, putting the RSM into the\nlead by 10 points.\nSpencer Lai\nOn the 23rd February 2008, the mighty\nRSM ladies Hockey team had made it\ndown to the deep wilds of the south-ern, in bred, daffodil growing region\nof Cornwall (yes Susie that\u2019s right!! ..\nit\u2019s the county we were in!) any way I\ndigress..\nThe team woke up at the never before\nseen hour of 6.45 (who knew?!) and\nmade their way downstairs to await the\ncoach, which duly arrived complete\nwith windscreen wipers.\nOn arrival the CSM team appeared\nto be undertaking some interesting\nscare-tactics in the form of stretching\nexercises. Of course we ladies fear not\nfor that kind of caper, since we had already warmed our voices and muscles\nup at the pre bottle match bar night\n(CSM idiots!)\nThe match began with frightening\nbattle cries and a push back by Sangy.\nWe knew the war of the two sides had\nbegun as \u2018banter\u2019 from both sides began\nto ring in our ears. The first half was\nan incredible match of skill from both\nsides, with some excellent passes being\nmade and some awesome runs. Many\na time did we get the ball into their D\nand frightened the goalie. However, at\nhalf time, the score was 0-0. We had\nrattled their sub-standard cages.. in\nfact so much they were actually yelling\nand shouting at each other and not at\nus (we\u2019re just THAT good!).\nAfter a half time speech by Sammy\nand Charlotte and a quick team reshuffle we were ready to rock again.\nUnfortunately, the Chunky Social\nMiscreants scored 2 goals in a row.\nB*atches.\nNot taking any of this rubbish from\nthe Camborners we fought back and\nsoon after the amazing skills of Miss\nSarah, came out in force. The goal\nwas a beauty, pure gold.. the short was\ntaken and crack.. right in the back of\nthe D\u2026 they didn\u2019t know what was\ncoming! Play continued with an amazing goal from Susie-Q who, at the goal\npost, neatly walloped the goal past the\nfeet of the blundering goalie.\nThe game was on! However, CSM\nscored a 3rd goal that was definitely\nover the backboard!!! Crip threw a\nrightful glare of hat at the ump, ripping\noff her helmet (so play had to stop) and\npromptly refusing to put it back on until she\u2019d been heard and the decision\nreversed. She got a green card.\nThe author asks why no-one remembers Sammy doing a Green pint, clearly this needs rectifying! The evils then\nscored a forth goal (cheeting wotsits)\nand time was called; only after Emma\nthumped a girl in the shin for being as\nugly as sin.\nA good game by all we fought hard\nand nearly reached the ultimate goal of\nthat cup! Next year we\u2019ll back, better\nthan before and we will win it, oh yes.\nWe\u2019ll drink champagne, absinthe, beer\nand Cr\u00e8me de Menthe (for sammy)\nfrom that cup and guard it with our\ndrunken lives from the cheating scumbag hags from Cornwall.\nCongratulations to all who played,\ndefinitely one of our best matches of\nthis year, I only hope our supporters\ndidn\u2019t make them cry too much, not!\nThis was always going to be a tough\nmatch as we had players missing and\nplayers on injuries but I still feel we had\na chance. Camborne decided though\nthat they weren\u2019t going to play fair and\nplay only 2 CSM players, the rest being\nringers.\nWe arrived to the ground with plenty\nof time so watched the first half of our\nheroic hockey players for inspiration in\nthe battle that lay before us. We had to\nfind our own changing room of which\nthe only one free was the ladies\u2019 (clear-ly some poor attempt at psychological\nwarfare from Camborne). But we rallied ourselves and marched out as one\nto the pitch to have our warmup. The\nfirst thing that we noticed was how utterly crap the pitch was, it had lines all\nover it like a tractor had been let loose.\nThe second thing we noticed was the\nhigh level of organisation Camborne\nhad, they were a team with only one\ngoal (well actually lots more but I\u2019ll get\nonto that) and that was to win.\nA few minutes before the hockey\nfinished the ref called both captains\nover and I won the toss and decided\nto stay the way we were facing. The\ngame kicked off and it was clear Camborne were stronger than us showing\nslick passing and a strong desire to win\nthe ball back if anything went astray. It\nwasn\u2019t long before they got their first\ngoal and then not long after got their\nsecond. And then as if it couldn\u2019t get\nany worse poor Dave Holder was taken\noff to hospital in an ambulance forcing a substitution and a slight change\nof formation. I cant really remember\nthe order of events after this up to half\ntime but we conceded another headed\ngoal owing to their superior aerial abil-ity, suffered another injury forcing a\nsubstitution and then Nic English was\nbooked. The challenge was most probably a bookable offence but a Camborne player had commited a far more\ncynical foul moments earlier and got\naway unpunished.\nAt half time I did not have many options so all I could say is to get stuck\nin as it was the only way we would get\nback into this, if we didn\u2019t we were going to lose.\nFor the beginning of the second\nhalf this seemed to work in holding\nthe score as it was and not conceding\nfor 10/15 minutes. Rowan Baker (our\nkeeper) pulled off some amazing saves\nand won every one on one. But then\na wonderful through ball completely\nunlocked us allowing them another\none on one which they finished well.\nTo compound the misery we suffered\nan injury to one of our players that was\nsubbed on earlier, we were down to\n10 players for a while as our final sub\nwas not ready (he wasn\u2019t originally going to play). We managed to stabilise\nthings for another short while but they\nwon a free kick about 35/40 yards out,\nthey pitched the ball into the area and\nGerry Vega put the ball gloriously into\nhis own net with a header any attacker\nwould be proud of. After this the game\nlost any momentum still left but there\nwas still time for Camborne to make\nanother through-ball which they finished and we got another booking as\nFootballers schooled by CSM\nStu Walters put in a late tackle that\ntheir player whinged like a little girl\nabout.\nAt the final whistle we congratulated\nCamborne on their win and then had\nto make a swift exit to get to the rugby\nwithout even having time to shower. As\nfor man of the match, we voted Camborne\u2019s number 14 who bossed the\ngame from start to finish in the centre,\nand they voted for Rowan our keeper\nfor a solid performance despite conceding more than he would\u2019ve liked to.\nNext year though, they will be beaten.\nSpencer Lai\nCSM were becoming predictable\nwith cross-field kicks from their fly\nhalf, most of which to no benefit with\nRSMrunningitstraightback.Onekick,\nhowever, bounced into touch inside the\nRoyal\u2019s 22. A quick line out from RSM\nsaw the catcher isolated from the rest\nof the forwards; turn over and CSM\nhad the ball in a dangerous position.\nEnthusiastic, over-committing to the\nsubsequent rucks gave CSM an over-lap, quick ball to their number 8 put\nhim in for a try. A missed conversion\nand the score sheet read 10-5. Attacking runs from centres, Nathan Alliston\nand Adam Foley, and quick rucking\nfrom the back rows, Mark Sanders and\nRichard Simons, gave RSM a strong\nplatform. CSM gave away a penalty\nwhich gave a line-out on the CSM five\nyard line. The ball was collected by\nCSM however superb ripping of the\nball from McLellan gave the ball back\nto RSM. CSM then penalised for playing the ball on the floor put the RSM\nin striking distance of the posts. A\nbeautiful kick from James Stewart and\nthe ball was neatly slotted between the\nThe Return of The Bottle!\nJoseph Franklin\nuprights; 13-5. Despite relentless attempts from the home team, the score\nremained unchanged at half time.\nThe second half started without\nO\u2019Mahony, who was receiving attention from paramedics for a head injury.\nThis allowed one of last year heroes,\nSimon Jones, on the pitch to put his\nstamp on the game. The CSM kept the\nball under their jumpers, keeping it\ntight in their forwards. Tough scrum-maging from the RSM gave the CSM\nscrappy ball, but they held possession,\nforcing penalty after penalty ten yards\nfrom the RSM line. Massive tackles\nensued, with the most unlikely of players guarding the CSM slow ball. The\nball was held up twice over the line,\nbut the tough defence failed, and CSM\ncapitalised, scoring a well deserved try;\n13-10. There was definitely a feeling of\npanic through the RSM camp, how-ever, pressure was relieved whenever\nthe ball went wide, through the RSM\nhands, with Tim Chalk making yards\neach time down the wing.\nEnd to end rugby followed, nevertheless the final whistle was looming\nand CSM were getting desperate. A\nbig push in the scrum from Orlando\nBrown, and instinctive hook from\nThomas Coggrave saw the CSM pack\nturned over for the first time. With a\nscrum inside the CSM half, the RSM\nsmashed the ball up the middle with\nthe demolition ball; Nathan Alliston.\nAfter smashing two of the CSM out\nof the way, a delicate touch put him in\na position with only one man to beat.\nAlliston chooses neither left nor right\nand goes for the central option into\nthe CSM fullback. Unfortunately the\nball slipped and was not grounded, a\nscrum follows and CSM have one final attempt, trying to run it from behind their own line. A knock on in fear\nof the RSM hits and the final whistle\nblows; RSM win 13:10; pitch invasion\nas a consequence and the Bottle is returned to its rightful owner- the RSM.\nLadies just miss out\nNice dress!\nThe RSM rugby team with The Bottle!\nGood old fashioned rivalry, a CSM shirt being burnt\nImperial College\nRoyal School of\nMines\nExeter University\nCamborne School of\nMines\n\n"

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n35\nFriday 7 March 2008 felix\nGames\nTableTops: Citadels\nJames Porter embarks on a royal quest to quell thievery, as an assassin\nC\nitadels is a card game\nset in medieval Europe.\nBustling market towns,\nroyal seats of power and\nfortresses are springing\nup. Every round players select a new\ncharacter (bishop, assassin etc.) to play\nin that round. Characters do things\nlike collect extra gold (especially the\nmerchant) or make you the king. Then\neach player will take a turn \u2013 gathering resources (gold and district cards),\nbuilding parts of their city (e.g. a tavern\nor a castle) and activating their unique\npower. Points are scored according to\nthe number of pieces of gold it costs\nto build the districts in your city, and\nthe game ends when someone has built\ntheir eighth district.\nIn Citadels each player is competing to build up his or her town. This\nis done by spending gold to build dis-tricts, which are taken from your hand\nof cards and placed face up on the table.\nWhen a player has built eight districts\nthe round is completed and the person\nwith the highest combined value of all\ntheir districts wins. Additionally, you\nget a bonus if you have eight districts\nand if you have at least one district of\neach colour. There are five colours representing different types of building.\nBlue is religious, yellow is royal, red is\nmilitary, green is trade. For example, a\nmonastery is blue and costs three gold\nto build. The fifth colour, purple, is a\ncollection of miscellaneous buildings\nwith various special powers. For ex-ample, the University costs six to build,\nbut instead of being worth six points,\nit is worth eight. The different colours\n(except purple) also link to the charac-ters; the merchant will collect income\n(one gold) from each trading (green)\nbuilding, whilst the warlord funds his\ncampaigns from red districts.\nCitadels is a light-hearted and, at\nabout an hour's playing time, has a\nreasonable playing length. It is\nalso flexible, as three to seven\nplayers can play. The number\nof players has a considerable\neffect on the gameplay. Games\noften end up quite close, since\nif someone gets ahead then\ntheir opponents can gang up\nto try and hinder them. This\nis often done by taking the\nassassin character and attempting to make the frontrunner miss his or her go.\nEach round the player with\nthe king token takes the\ncharacter cards and shuffles them. He or she then\nplaces one face down in the\nmiddle of the table, so that\na character is not available\nthat round. Additionally,\nonly the king knows who it\nis. He or she then selects\na character (keeping it se-cret) and passes the other\ncards to his or her left.\nThis is repeated until the\nlast player has a choice of\ntwo characters, placing\nthe last one face down\nin the middle of the ta-ble. In this fashion noone knows exactly who\nany of the other players\nare. Then the king asks\nthe assassin to reveal\nhimself. The player who\ntook the assassin proceeds\nto take his or her go. This involves collecting two gold or drawing district\ncards and then getting the opportunity\nto lay a single district card in their city,\npaying the appropriate amount of gold.\nByte\nZack and Wiki Flash\nhttp://ms2.nintendo-europe.\ncom/zackwiki/enGB/index.\nhtml\nNow, this is a conundrum but\na good one. One of the Wii\u2019s\npremier puzzle games gets\nthe demo treatment in le Flash\nform.\nWhile Tomo vouches that the\nactual game is quality (albeit\ngetting a tad frustrating), all I\nhave is the demo to go by. And\ny\u2019know what? If this snippet is\nany indication then we have\nquite an enticing puzzler in our\nhands. It may be a single level but it\u2019s a pretty interesting\nteaser. Like adventure games\nof yore, point-and-click is the\nway to go although the selectable items are clearly marked\nmeaning that you spent more\ntime pondering and less time\ngroping for random pixels.\nRegardless of how quickly\nyou solve it, it\u2019s a tantalising\ndistraction at the very least.\nAzfarul Islam\nTower of Goo\nhttp://www.experimen-talgameplay.com/game.\nphp?g=17\nSometimes while researching\nthis column we come across\na game concept that seems\nso obvious that we wonder\nwhy we haven\u2019t seen it before.\nTower of Goo, then, is one of\nthese concepts. Part of the\nExperimental Gaming Project,\nwhich pushed five MIT postgraduates to create 30 games\nin 30 weeks, it\u2019s one of the\ngreatest experiments we can\nthink of. Back to the game, in\nwhich you build a tower using\ngoo blobs as girders: creating the sticky equivalent of the\nLeaning Tower of Eiffel. It\u2019s so\nsimple that it works throughout\n\u2013 the art is cute and cartoony,\nbut never distracting; the music is upbeat, but not annoy-ing; and the physics engine\nthat the game is built upon is\nsolid. And all made in a week.\nWe recommend getting the\nunlimited version, as it ups the\ndifficulty enough to keep you\ncoming back.\nSebastian Nordgren\nThey may also activate their unique\nability; for the assassin this is declaring\na character to assassinate. However, the\nassassin does not know for sure (they\nmay have a good idea) who each player\nhas taken, and who is not being played\nthis round. So it is a bit of a guess.\nThen the king calls for the thief. The\nthief takes his turn and also selects a\ncharacter (that cannot be the assassin\nor the assassin\u2019s target) to steal from.\nWhen the character\u2019s turn arrives,\nthey lose all their gold! The thief takes\nany gold they were storing up to build\nwith this turn. That character still gets\nto take their turn (unlike the assassin\u2019s\nunfortunate victim) including getting\nmore gold, but it can be infuriating\n(you can tell I\u2019m talking from experience here).\nThe other characters take their turns\nin order, and if no one answers to a\nparticular character it is because they\nweren\u2019t chosen and play passes to the\nnext character. In the next round the\nnew king (whoever took the king card\nlast time) chooses a new character and\nplay continues as before. The rounds\ncontinue until a player or players complete eight districts, when the gold cost\nof all your districts is counted up\n(adding any bonuses you may\nhave accumulated) and the\nwinner is the player with\nthe highest total (not necessarily the most districts).\nThis is a tactical game\nwhere being able to second\nguess what other people\nare doing will give you\nthe edge. You never want\nto hold too much gold or\ntoo many cards, as people\nwill target you ruthlessly\n(seriously, though, this\nis quite a jolly game!).\nAdditionally, it is good\nto diversify your city.\nHaving many districts\nof one colour will make\nthe corresponding character very valuable to\nyou for collecting gold,\nalthough it will become\neasy for the others to\nguess who you are.\nChoosing expensive\nbuildings is risky because you will have to\nsave up (cue the thief),\nbut cheap buildings\nare easily destroyed by\nthe warlord. It\u2019s your\nchoice; it\u2019s a gamble!\nIf you would like to\nplay Citadels or other\nboard games and card\ngames, there is a regular session on Monday\nevenings run by the Wargames society.\nDon\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t familiar with\na game \u2013 we routinely explain games.\nEmail wargames@imperial.ac.uk for\nmore information.\n\n"

    "content": "6 felix Friday 7 March 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nThe Farcity of Varsity\n[Insert witty name]\nL\nast week was that time of\nthe year again, and no, I\ndon\u2019t mean the leap year, as\nthat made absolutely no difference to my life whatsoever although I do now know someone\nwho is five whole years old at Imperial\n(*snigger*).No,lastWednesdaymarked\nthe grand tradition of Varsity, the day\nwhere I usually bugger off someplace\nthat isn\u2019t campus or Richmond. Unfortunately for me I had to be at the Union\nthat night.\nI know a lot of you like Varsity; I\ncan tell this from such Facebook proclaiming \u201cSo-and-so is excited about\nvarsity!!! Whoop whoop!!! let\u2019s kick\nsome medic ass!!!\u201d No I do not wish to\nkick some medic ass; I, in fact, have no\nproblems with medics.\nLet me set the scene at the Union\nthat cruel, bleak Wednesday evening\nthat I descended from the third floor to\ncelebrate a good first night. Damn goes\nmy anonymity; yes, I was at a show. So\nanyway I managed to get to the Union\nbar with not too much trouble; hell I\neven managed to get a drink (when my\nsix foot friend brought it for me). We\nhad a nice bit of chat before a loud noise\ncould be heard from the doorway; my\ncompanions and I turned to find half\nour friends barricaded by some rather\nloud sports-type chappies (I have been\ninformed they were footballers, not\nrugby players, but how the hell would\nI know?). They were all wearing those\nties and one guy was even sporting a\nbalaclava. So to cut a long story short,\nwe were effectively held hostage in the\nUnion bar because of the sports-type\nchappies. I finally managed to get out\nby smiling nicely at the bouncer guys\nand then shoving my way through the\nside of the sports-types chappies whilst\nglaring evilly at them.\nI know that its meant to be tradition\nand only a bit of fun, but how come\nsport is allowed to set a precedent\nover everything? Varsity took up all\nthree bars plus the outside area, leaving those who didn\u2019t want to join in\nthe \u201cgetting pissed as a newtness\u201d a bit\nstuck. Of course, those there probably\ndidn\u2019t realise that not everybody in the\nworld loves sport as much as them and\nthat\u2019s generally the problem I find with\nsports people. I have no problem with\nsport itself; it\u2019s a good way to get out\naggression, creates companionship\nand is a nice way to spend your time.\nIt\u2019s the sports mentality I have a problem with. Why is there such a connection between sport and drinking, for a\nstart, surely it\u2019s damaging your body\nwhen you should be fighting fit. There\nare so many drinking games and \u201cdirty\npints\u201d associated with sports clubs\nwhich could alienate many people.\nThis can hardly entail having a good\ntime, can it?\nI guess it resorts from being rubbish at Games lessons, one time even\nbeing picked out as being one of the\npoorer kids in the class. The country\nhas grown up with this sports mentality where it comes before anything\nelse. Take the Olympics, for instance;\nthe taxpayers are paying millions of\npounds for it to come to our coun-try... in 4 years time! Everytime there\u2019s\nno news, we\u2019re subjected to another\n\u201cyoung hopeful\u2019s\u201d heart-rending story\nof how they\u2019re going to make it. The\nonly form of patriotism we have is\nthrough sport, I remember my sister\ntelling me at the time of the last world\ncup when I moaned about it that I\u2019d be\ngrateful when we get a day off for win-ning. Sorry sis, it ain\u2019t gonna happen.\nYet the West End\u2019s theatres are in desperate need for funding to stop them\nfalling down, our film industry is going\ndown the drain and the government\nis only concerned with us doing more\nsport, as it\u2019ll stop obesity.\nSport at Imperial seems to be such\na big deal, Wednesday afternoon is\nmeant to be set aside for \u201csporting\nactivities\u201d whereas those wanting to\ndo arty societies have to do it in their\nevenings. There\u2019s Sport Imperial to\nlook after it all. Where\u2019s Art Imperial\nthen for all of us that can\u2019t throw a ball?\nThere\u2019s sports night every Wednesday\nat the Union, where\u2019s Arts night? We\nneed to readdress the Sports-ArtsDrink balance at Imperial, Varsity can\nstay, but can we be more inclusive and\naccept that there are those who don\u2019t\nwant to get bare-faced drunk in the\nname of sport.\n[...]\nClass warfare\nA\nt this present hour, various people are no doubt\ndoing various things, in\nthat curious manner of a\ntruism always being true.\nThe studious will be revising some\ncomplicated lecture, fortifying their\ngrip of the subject matter. The clever\nare sleeping, a fact I am certain of because my communications with a clever chap confirmed this earlier. Perhaps\nhe was lying, but then he is clever, and\nno doubt appreciates the inexplicable\ntruth that people that lie to me are so\nvery often the subject of forensic study\nand questions of a nature similar to,\n\u201cjust how did that widget get so very\ndeep in his intestinal tract?\u201d But such\npeculiarities are better left to philosophers and detectives and we should return to the matter at hand.\nThe sick are no doubt observing the\nsymptoms their illness demands. Another class of people I find the appropriate adjectives too vulgar to employ\nare no doubt spending these moments\npartaking in ravenous and ravaging\nsexual intercourse and perhaps mutually inducing each to shriek in a manner altogether more appropriate for\ndeterring murderers, double-glazing\nsalesmen and others of their dire ilk.\nBut I, my dear peasants, peons, Lords\nand Ladies, am a genius. Thus I, due to\nmy immensely charitable nature, am\nawake at this time, creating this article so you might revel in some small\nscrap of my illustrious talents. There\nis no doubt many a buxom vixen deliriously desirous of my genius in other\nfields, but I choose to deprive her of a\ntremendously wonderful (and being all\ntoo aware of my skills, no doubt short!)\ngame of chess in order to help enlighten your narrow peon minds with my\nwisdom.\nNo doubt all too many of you have\ncome across a most abject stain of the\nreputation of imperial. The beloved\nPrince Albert, who ever watches over\nus, would weep the oceans if he was\nalive today; God (my one, not yours,\nyour one is so utterly awful, I simply\ncannot bear Him/Her/It/Them) rest\nhis soul, he was truly a Prince among\nmen, if you\u2019ll forgive the pun. No\nmember of our college can rest easily while such an aberration against all\nthat is sacrosanct continues to spread\nits vile corruption. Those apathetic to\nthis matter, or, God forbid it, actively\nsupporting it, deserve to be crushed\nbeneath a blasted tank and then repeatedly shot like the filth they are. I\ntalk of course, of tea. More specifically,\nwhat every shop in South Kensington\nthinks passes for tea.\nTea is not some puerile sludge like\ncoffee; tea is not drunk by philistine\nharlots and \u2018men\u2019 (beasts, beasts I say!)\nof despicable characters, possessed\nwith all the morals of a communist trol-lop. The cretinous continentals (and\nall too often our own typically diligent\nworking class sometimes succumbs to\nthis treachery, this defilement of their\nheritage) employed in our London es-tablishments, most frequently spotted\naround our ancient and most prestigious underground and railway stations,\nthink tea is a matter of boiling water,\na tea bag and some milk thrown in for\ngood measure! I gawk in disbelief at\nthe sheer morbid and perverse nature\nof such an idea. Tea is not instant! Nor\ncan it ever be made to be! Placing the\nmilk in with a bag still in the process of\ndiffusing its ambrosia through the hot\nwater serves only to stifle and suffocate\nthe divine essence that had been imbuing itself. No, tea is not primarily a\ndrink; it is primarily a test of patience,\ncare and a firm but tender hand (the\nsort of hand those people having ravenous and ravaging sexual intercourse\nmentioned earlier might use if their\nprocedure involved S&M or such like).\nTea must be brewed; the tea bag\nmust be allowed to infuse itself into\npure water, with nothing to disrupt the\nritual. I myself set the timer for three\nminutes, though it is accepted wisdom\nthat the brewing procedure may take\nanywhere between three and five min-utes. Do less than this and you have\ngnat\u2019s piss. Do more than this and you\nhave allowed it to stew. Present either\nof these results to your influential dinner party guests and you will be ostra-cised from high society and will have\nto seek cheap frills in some dingy tavern with the working class and their\ntyphoid and dysentery. But this is what\nshops in South Kensington continue to\ngive me.\nNever mind that my ancestors\nbuilt an Empire so that I could enjoy\na steady flow of top quality tea. Well,\nthey contributed to the building of the\nEmpire no doubt by growing potatoes\n(for army rations!) and being whipped\nby English tyrants and the like. I suppose also they occasionally joined the\nIRA and got hanged for treason but\non the plus side, this does allow me to\nalter nationality based on whomever is\ncurrently winning in that Six Nations\ncuriosity.\nI think currently I\u2019m Welsh; on the\nbasis of having a Welsh friend, but such\nthings are intrinsically fickle, sport being what it is. And for those reasons\nI am vastly overcharged, not least of\nall because for the price of a so-called\ncup (a cardboard tube is not a cup, a\nporcelain masterpiece dating from the\nGeorgian era is a cup) I could pay fifteen children to mine coal for me for a\nyear. No doubt Chancellor Metternich\nis behind it all, the wanker.\nViscount\nKensington\nThe perfect brew takes 3\u20135 minutes. No more. No less. You dolt\n\u201c\nTea must\nbe brewed; the\ntea bag must\nbe allowed to\ninfuse itself\ninto pure water,\nwith nothing\nto disrupt the\nritual\n\n"

    "content": "The Bottle is back!\nThe Royal School of Mines report on their successful trip down to Camborne\nCharlotte Atteck\nRSM Sports Officer\nAfter seven years, we have finally\nbrought the Sharpley Cup back home\nafter the victory against the evil CSM.\nIt was a cold Saturday morning somewhere in Cornwall, where the RSM\nMen\u2019s hockey team battled the CSM\nafter the ladies\u2019 match. After a good\nrun around the pitch as our warm-up, we were up for this big match.\nThe match began with a right-hand\nside attack from David Holder and the\nfirst ten minutes of the match we were\nconstantly attacking in their \u2018D\u2019. We\nthen quickly saw the skills from our\nmidfielders, Mikey, David Whittleston,\nAndy Bromfield and Nic Jones, from\nthe creative passes and the dominating\ncontrol of the ball. However with a bit\nof luck, CSM managed to score the first\ngoal from a short corner twenty minutes into the game. Shortly they scored\nagainst us, we put our bodies in front\nof the CSM goal and may be our black\nshirts made them scared where Andy\nBromfield found a gap in the CSM defence and he never disappointed any-one. Andy\u2019s goal was important and we\nused it as the platform to score another\ngoal by Yung very shortly into the second half. Later on after the second goal\nfrom RSM, CSM put a lot of pressures\nonto our defences.\nThis is the time when we showed to\nour supporters that RSM has an all-round team. Our defences were amaz-ing, Chaz Murdoch made lots of fine\ntackles on the right-hand side; Matt\nT\nhis year saw the 106th\nBottle Match take place\ndown in Cornwall deep in\nthe land of the inbred and\nthe illiterate. For those\nof you out there who haven\u2019t heard of\nthe Bottle Match it\u2019s the second oldest varsity match in the country played\nbetween the Royal School of Mines\nand the Camborne School of Mines.\nInitially focusing on rugby, it then expanded over the many years to encompass football, hockey, squash and golf\nand is the highlight of the RSM calen-dar. Why, you say? Well, it ticks all the\nboxes of an awesome weekend; sport,\nalcohol and more often than not some\npublic displays of nudity\u2026\nSetting off on Friday midday was a\nmission in itself with the busses showing up two hours late. However, this did\ngive most people the chance to get a\nfew cheeky morning pints down before\nwe even set off so the mood was not all\ntogether compromised. It seemed our\nluck was going form bad to worse as a\ncombination of traffic accidents, broken toilets and broken wipers delayed\nus even further although, as pointed\nout by most people, it wouldn\u2019t be\nRSM if things went according to plan\n(in fact I think most people were surprised we even had a plan..).\nAll in all we managed to roll into\nNewquay for 9.00pm and send the\nsquash players on their way to Falmouth in the hopes of bringing the\noverall score to 1-1 after the golf teams\u2019\nnarrow defeat to CSM earlier on in the\nday. Alas, it wasn\u2019t to be, news returned\nof their unrewarded struggle and it was\noff to Weatherspoons to drown sorrows for all.\nAfter all the games had been played,\noff we went to their union, through\nfences, fields, forests and bogs to reach\nan empty union as CSM were late in\narriving, we were all very understanding as technology has yet to arrive to\nCSM and it was a cloudy day blocking\nthe sun so they had clearly lost track of\ntime. They were there eventually and\nafter we ate something which I was\ntold was curry it was time for the prize\ngiving ceremony and my \u00a327 pound\ndirty pint, both of which turned out to\nbe quite unsettling and seemed to go\non forever. The traditional food fight\nbroke out and then it was time for the\nDJ to play some NOW albums from\nthe early 90\u2019s. I\u2019m told there was dancing and good time had by all; I could\nonly witness the event from a dark corner with my head in my lap most of the\nevening.\nHeading back to London on Sunday\nthe weekend had taken its toll on most\nbar a few eager freshers who were still\nnursing a can or two of Carlsberg, their\nlivers have yet to deteriorate as most\ndo after 3 years at university, bless\u2026.\nAll that is left to say is a HUGE\nTHANK YOU to everyone who came\nalong. Supporters, the weekend would\nnot be the same without you guys\nkeeping the spirit and dare I say it\u2026\nbanter (ref. Sanders, Mark) alive. Players, the passion everyone played with\nthis weekend was immense, it\u2019s clear\nhow much this means to all connected\nto the RSM, you guys were awesome.\nThe 2008 RSM Golf Bottle Match was\ntruly a memorable experience. The\ngolf course was nothing short of spec-tacular, with well-maintained fairways\nand views overlooking the coast and\nocean.\nFrom the start, we knew we faced\nan uphill task as our opponents were\nmore familiar with the golf course and\nmore acclimatised to the windy condi-tions. Also, the greens were considerably faster and more unpredictable than\nthose we were accustomed to back in\nLondon, handing a further advantage\nto the more experienced opposing\nteam.\nAlthough these factors were to our\ndisadvantage, we managed to stay almost on par with the CSM team with\nour first pair, Oliver and Craig, being\nall square and our second pair, Zhi and\nNara, being one down after nine holes.\nWe continued to fight and the first\nmatch ended up in a tie. However, our\nsecond pair lost eventually three down\nwith two to play and thus we conceded\nthe title to our opponents. Despite the\ndefeat, our team enjoyed the match\nand we will look to avenge our defeat\nnext year!\nJames put up a massive performance in\nthe middle with Sam Philip; Sam used\nhis experiences and made some good\ndecisions and Ade our goal keeper\nsaved us from losing to the white and\nblue shirts (CSM).\nHowever, every big match came\nclose. CSM scored after our second\ngoal from a short corner (also with a\nbit of luck) to level with us. But very\nshortly our forwards saw the weakness\nof the CSM defences when they tried\nto control the ball in our half. First\nAndy scored again to put us 3:2 ahead\nthen a great pass from Andy to Steve\nSmith into the CSM \u2018D\u2019 and a fascis-tic partnership from Yung and Steve\npaid off when Yung scored a cracking\ngoal which is his second of the match.\nThis weak point at the CSM defence\nwas created by the excellent performance from Nic Jones which opened up\nlots of space in the CSM half. Nic was\nawarded the Bottle Match Man of the\nMatch with a \u00a320 alcoholic drink at the\nparty.\nWe were fighting until the end because CSM never gave us a break and\nthey scored eight minutes before the\nend of their deaths to make the score\n4:3 to RSM, which is the final score of\nthis year Bottle Match Hockey. The\ncelebration began after the match\nwith lots of alcohol (and of course we\nalso have the choice of non alcoholic\ndrinks) in RSM style and this celebration continues until the after Bottle\nMatch bar night on Thursday.\nFinally I would like to thank all the\nsupporters who came down to Cornwall with the teams, without your support and most importantly the banters\nMen\u2019s hockey Sharpley Cup returns after 7 years\nSpencer Lai we will not have a great match. Also\nthank you to CSM, hard luck try again\nnext year, and thank you to Charlotte\nfor organized this great Bottle Match\nweekend. One last word from me:\nBloody well done RSM Hockey!\nAfter spending 7 hours chilling on\nthe coach to Newquay, the squash\nteam realised that they still had another 45mins taxi to go to Falmouth.\nEven though it was already 10 p.m., the\ntoken squash team was still up for a bit\nof squash banter. Strolling in across the\nsquash courts, we were confident, since\nlast year we managed to beat them 5-0\nin London. But as we stepped in it hit\nus, like the shock of a slap in the face,\nwe were out of our league. The ringers\nin their team were obvious. The team\nhad been at the courts training since\n7pm. To add to our sporting enjoyment a large crowd of CSM supports\nwere positioned in stands behind the\nglass court. They too had been training their beer drinking hands.\nAs someone famous once said\n\u2018squash is boxing with racquets\u2019; the\nlightweights on their team were pretty\nquick to beat us down. We scraped a\nfew points but the first four games\nwere dismissed quickly. I wont go into\nit. The only convincing brawl of the\nevening was our first seed Rob Nagle,\nwho managed to keep decent rallies\ngoing. Unfortunately for Rob their first\nseed was training to be a squash coach,\nfortunately for us he\u2019s not going in to\nmining; Camborne \u2013 Probably the\nworst school of mines in the world.\nGolf and squash\nluck out to CSM\nJon Downing &\nZhi Yang\nCSM robot getting taken down...

Now I know I\nsaid I didn\u2019t care about\nthem, I know I\u2019m being\na hypocrite, but this is\ntoo good to resist. The winners of the\nShockwaves NME Awards 2008 were\nannounced last week to much pomp\nand fanfare, confirming in the process\nthe rumours that the popular alternative music scene has indeed ascended\nup its own arse and disappeared into an\ninfinite loop of self-congratulation and\nself-importance. The situation is similar to the game \u2018Portal\u2019, except instead\nof shooting portals, you shoot arses.\nAnd instead of the premise of the game\nbeing to escape from the test facility, it\nis to give kudos to awful bands and to\nmake me generally depressed. And instead of Weighted Companion Cubes,\nyou have\u2026etc.\nI wasn\u2019t expecting a sudden epiphany\non NME\u2019s part this year \u2013 it was obvious they were going to give awards\nsuch as \u2018Best Album\u2019, \u2018Best Radio Show\u2019\nand \u2018Best Dressed\u2019 to celebrities with\nmediocre albums (Klaxons \u2013 \u2018Myths\nof the Near Future\u2019), mediocre radio\nshows (Zane Lowe) and questionable\ndress senses (Noel Fielding). It\u2019s not like\nI was eagerly awaiting the announcement of the winners so I could engage\nin the ritual berating of the NME and\nthe lamentation of the loss of times\ngone by when it was the real alterna-tive, which of course accompanies the\nevent every year. No, the reason I am\ncondescending to mention the NME\nAwards is because, ironically, of their\nnon-music awards, which serve as a\ntroubling illustration of the mindset of\nthe readership (outside of poor musical taste).\nA prime example is Pete Doherty,\nthe troubled young poet (no less than\nhalf an English Literature degree to his\nname) and frontman of indie group\nBabyshambles, took home the \u2018Hero\nof the Year\u2019 award. All congratulations\nare due to the man who managed to\nnot smoke crack or shoot up heroin for\nan entire year. Perhaps if we all took his\nexample and stopped smoking crack\nand shooting up heroin, we too could\nbe recipients of this prestigious acco-lade. Not to mention get a lot more\ndone.\nFurthermore, the award for \u2018Best Live\nEvent\u2019 went to the corporate-selloutprepubescent-indie-scenester-\u00a3130per-ticket-rapefest(s), the \u2018Carling\nWeekend: Reading and Leeds Festivals\u2019.\nFor those who haven\u2019t attended, there is\nactually an NME-sponsored stage (the\n\u2018NME Stage\u2019) at the festival, so it is not\nmuch of a surprise this got a mention\nbut I\u2019m sure we would all appreciate it\nif they were a bit more subtle and a bit\nless shameless with their advertising.\nI was going to stop but OK one more.\n\u2018Villain of the Year\u2019 went, for the third\nyear running, to George W. Bush. Why?\nI have absolutely no idea. Neither does\nthe NME. Neither does anyone.\nI\u2019m really sorry. I promise the next\ncolumn I write will be about something I like and I won\u2019t mention NME.\nI don\u2019t enjoy being grumpy.

With over six million\nalbums sales in the bag and a music\ncareer spanning 14 years, is it really any wonder that The Cardigans\nhave received numerous accolades\nand a widespread fan-base? Best Of\nis the long anticipated amalgamation of the band\u2019s twenty-one or so\nfinest hits taken from their past six\nstudio albums, comprising huge\nstormers like \u2018Lovefool\u2019 (from the\nalbum \u2018First Band on the Moon\u2019)\nwhich featured in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s\nblockbuster romantic tragedy that\nis Romeo and Juliet.

Nina Persson\u2019s prominent vocals show remarkable versatili-ty, playful and coquettish with a strong\nhint of longing on tracks like \u2018Lovefool\u2019\n(with its saccharine and teasing tone\u201cLove me, love me, say that you\u2019ll love\nme\u201d combined with the dynamic disco\nbeats, making it highly infectious and\nexceedingly memorable) or raw and\nsomewhat dark and edgy on the lines\nof \u2018My Favourite Game\u2019 and \u2018War.\u2019\nThis greatest album is\nsuitably chronologically arranged,\nbeginning with\nearly material\ntaken from\ntheir debut\nalbum Emmerdale.\u2018Rise\n& Shine\u2019 and\n\u2018Sick and\nTired\u2019 are\nboth quin-tessentially\nlight-heart-ed, reminiscent of\nbreezy,\nsunny summer days with\nthe appearance of jangling,\nSmiths-esque guitars, a quick tempo,\nstrong sense of rhythm, epitomizing\nthe pleasantly upbeat feel-good factor\nthat is the hallmark of their music.

The line-up\nfor all the gigs have been impressive\nthis year, but Cut Copy really take to\ntheir own becoming more than just\na support act. They weren\u2019t there to\nwarm up the audience, although that\nwas done without them breaking into\nsweat, they were there to play for their\nfans who seemed to be as interested\nin their glockenspiel-popping beats as\nthey were in the main act.\nHadouken! stormed the stage and in\na mist of flying glowsticks and sounding the alarm bells they launch straight\ninto \u2018Bounce\u2019, making even the pre-pu-bescent teens \u2018bounce their balls.\u2019 The\nstylish Alice Spooner seems to be the\nbackbone of this band, pumping out\nthe synths that make Hadouken! who\nthey are.\nNamed after one of the greatest\nmoves in Saga Megadrive\u2019s Street\nFighter (three older brothers and a\nchildhood of consoles teach a girl\nsomething) these guys can really throw\na punch. Each song is a new explosion\nof energy knocking the audience into a\nfrenzy.\nWith a debut album set for release,\nvocalist James Smith tests the water with a few new tracks that show\nHadouken! will last, and that their indie grime synth metallic mind-blowing\nnoise can create more than the odd\nhit. And then more of the \u2018old\u2019, \u2018Dancing lesson,\u2019 \u2018Liquid Lives\u2019 and of course\nthe legendary \u2018Tuning in\u2019 before the\nbeats of \u2018That Boy That Girl\u2019 called for\nbedtime for all the \u2018Hoxton Heros\u2019 and\n\u2018Indie Cindies\u2019 \u2013 there was school the\nnext day after all.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFriday 7 March 2008 felix\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nW\nelcome art aficio-nados! For that\nis what you all\nare by now, after\nweeks and weeks\nand maybe even years of ensconcing\nyourselves in these enlightening pages!\nUnfortunately, this is the penultimate\nissue of the Lenten (or \u201cspring\u201d) term\nand soon, for one month, you must\nresort to the art sections of other me-dia. I recommend the arts section of\nThe Independent, especially what they\nhave to say on Saturdays. However,\nwith the threat of lectures, labs and\nother laborious chores out the way\nyou will be able to stop reading Felix\nArts and start experiencing some art;\nhopefully the holidays will leave you\nwill some time for respite. Without relaxation and leisure our brains cannot\nfunction properly and efficiently and\nso I urge you to indulge!\nI came across one of the most random and brilliant concepts in art over\nthe last couple of weeks. Situated in\nthe Blyth Centre (Level 5 of Sherfield,\nI\u2019ve told you enough times), was a\nlovely photographic exhibition examining expression. Down one section\nof the gallery was littered haphazardly\na whole pack of playing cards. Such a\nsimple idea yet I was bizarrely cheered\nby it, for its uniqueness, every time I\nwalked by it. It reminded me of an episode of Sex and the City where Carrie\n(SJP) goes on a date with a guy who\ncollects lone playing cards he finds in\nthe street. Ever since watching this, I\nhave been struck by how many single\nplaying cards one encounters on the\nstreets! I have to suppress an urge to\nstart my own collection every time I\nsee one.\nFans of film Empire Records may\nremember AJ gluing coins to the floor\nof the music stores office. Random art,\nthe best kind. Although \u201crandom art\u201d\nis possibly the most vague notion one\ncan come up with!\nA piece I recently fell in love with\nhangs in the Alexia Goethe gallery\non Dover street, a few doors down\nfrom Mahiki for those who read heat\nor frequent the club. Measuring 1m\nby 2m (at least) it is a piece of paper\nonto which a huge polar bear has been\nsketched: in neon pink roller ball. Not\nonly is the colour utterly spectacular,\ncontrasting to the stark white paper,\nbut think of how long it would have\ntaken to sketch; the callous sustained\nto the artist from holding a pen for so\nlong and the sheer amount of roller\nballs he would have gone through!\nAnother gem tucked away amid the\nwinding streets of Soho is Carnaby\nKiss, reviewed by moi in this issue.\nWe have more reviews from Arts\nEditors in the form of Emily Wilson\u2019s\nreview of Duchamp et al. and David\nPaw\u2019s Vanity Fair portraits review. The\nexhibition is sponsored by Burberry,\nalthough quite sensibly one never sees\nan inch of their pattern, synonymous\nwith chavdom, in any of their shop\nwindows anymore let alone in the\nNPG: quite sensibly.\nPoetry in the Periodic\nTable? Charm in chemistry?\nScience and Art. Either, or... Iain Watts discovers the late Primo Levi and his ability to\nsmash this concept and intertwine the two disciplines with beautiful results\nU\nnfortunately, the old idea\nof a divide between the\narts and the sciences is\none which steadfastly\nrefuses to die. For all his\nmedical training, John Keats was still\ndeeply troubled by Science\u2019s tendency\nto \u201cconquer all mysteries by rule and\nline\u201d, reducing Nature\u2019s beauty to, as\nhe saw it \u201cthe dull catalogue of common things.\u201d The American poet Sylvia Plath was harsher: \u201cThe day I went\ninto Physics class\u201d, she writes in her\nautobiographical novel The Bell Jar, \u201cit\nwas death\u201d.\nOn the other side of the fence, the\nNobel Prize-winning physicist Richard\nFeynman used to make his immunity\nto what he scornfully termed \u2018culture\u2019\nsomething of a badge of pride, claiming that the best thing he derived from\nreading the ancient Greek playwright\nAristophanes was learning how to\nmake a good frog noise. The mud-slinging, from both sides, is endless.\nBut, instead of becoming entangled\nin the interminable debate on the ArtsSciences divide, the Two Cultures, and\nall the rest of it, I simply want to tell\nyou about a little book by a writer who\nI think bridges the gulf so effortlessly\nthat, for him, the two worlds merge\nseamlessly into one. The writer is\nPrimo Levi and the book is called The\nPeriodic Table.\nPrimo Levi was born into a Jewish\nfamily in Turin, northern Italy, in 1919.\nHe took a degree in Chemistry at the\nUniversity of Turin, and followed a\ncareer as a professional chemist, predominantly in the paint and varnish\nindustry, before eventually retiring\nin 1975 to concentrate full-time on\nwriting. He published memoirs, short\nstories, novels, essays, and poetry, all\navailable in good English translations.\nThe central experience of Levi\u2019s life,\nwhich informed nearly everything he\nwas to write afterwards, was the year\nhe spent as a prisoner in Auschwitz\nbetween 1944 and 1945. His deeply\nmoving and very personal account of\nhis time there, If This Is a Man, established his reputation as\na writer and eventually became accepted\nas one of the masterpieces of 20th century autobiography.\nThough The Periodic\nTable draws on this\nharrowingexperience\nin several chapters, it\nmostly concentrates\non the rest of his life,\nas a chemist in his native Italy.\nIt is a book which steadfastly resists\ncategorisation. Perhaps I can best describe it simply as a book of stories,\neach one linked in some way to a\nchemical element, or to ideas associated with an element. Many of the twen-ty-one chapters are autobiographical,\noften episodes taken from Levi\u2019s life\nas a chemistry student and later professional chemist; two chapters, \u2018Lead\u2019\nand \u2018Mercury\u2019, are completely fictional,\nand the final chapter takes the form of\na kind of prose-poem, on the story of\nan individual atom of carbon.\nThe ever-familiar periodic table of\nthe elements, Levi boldly proclaims,\nis poetry, \u2018the bridge, the missing link,\nbetween the world of words and the\nworld of things\u2019. It is simultaneously\nthe framework which brings order and\nharmony to matter and the device by\nwhich Levi ties together the stories\nthat make up the book. In some chapters the chemistry itself plays a central\nrole, while in others the reference is\nmore oblique: \u2018Iron\u2019, for example, really\nconcerns Sandro, the fellow chemistry\nstudent, resistance\nfighter, and man-of-iron who introduces\nLevi to the joys of\nrock-climbing in the\nfoothills of the Alps.\nLevi has a rare gift\nfor finding beauty,\neven mysticism,\nwoven through the\neveryday and the\nmundane. Under his\nhands the asbestos\nmine where he works as\nan analyst is a benign incarnation of\nthe tiered Inferno of Dante\u2019s Divine\nComedy, and the University laboratory where he learns his trade becomes\nalmost a religious temple, a \u2018House of\nthe Lord\u2019, where the lone chemist is\nlocked in a primal struggle with Matter, who stands ready to trip him up at\nevery turn, \u2018as solemn and subtle as the\nsphinx\u2019. One of my personal favourite\nchapters, \u2018Chromium\u2019, is actually about\n\u2013 of all things \u2013 a chemical mystery\nconcerning bad batches of an anti-rust\npaint, beautifully interwoven with the\nstory of Levi\u2019s slow spiritual recovery\nand awakening after his return to Italy\nat the end of the War.\nLevi speaks of chemistry in an unusual and wonderful way, as a kind of\nmystical union and struggle between\nthe mind of Primo Levi the Chemist\nand the base elements with which he\nworks, in spirit perhaps not very far\nfrom the transmutations of the alche-mists. His terms of reference are very\nwide, encompassing languages, philos-ophy, and literature, and with barely a\nhint of pretentiousness he slips in references to everything from Aristotelian philosophy to Flaubert\u2019s Madame\nBovary to Ibsen\u2019s Peer Gynt. Clearly\nhe is very well-read, but then I think a\nfairly surprising number of scientists\nare, though they may suffer, perhaps,\nfrom a tendency to keep it quiet.\nUltimately, despite the chemical ti-tles, and the many technical details of\napplied chemistry scattered through\nthe text, the focus of each story is always centred, quite firmly, on human\nbeings. The elements serve as a brilliant extended metaphor for tying together Levi\u2019s scattered examinations\nof such broad topics as work, love, and\nhappiness. This makes the book a rare\nthing: it is both science writing, and \u2013\nyes \u2013 Literature.\nPlease, fellow students, read this\nbook. Even if you are the hard-headed\nsworn and bitter enemy of anything\nbranded \u2018Literary\u2019 or \u2018highbrow\u2019, make\nan exception just for this. Because Primo Levi deserves to be read. By eve-ryone, but especially by scientists, by\nyou. So, beg, borrow, or dare I say it\nbuy a copy, and begin.\nA Carnaby Kiss. Gentle alliteration\ncombined with onomatopoeia; just the\nname of this exhibition sounds like the\ncaress of your loved one\u2019s lips brushing your lips (or otherwise). Now I\nhave been sufficiently cheesy I can get\non with telling you that \u2018Carnaby Kiss\u2019\nis anything but, and the last thing it\nevokes is the sickeningly kitsch effect\nthat St Valentine\u2019s day has on every\nother high street in the land. St. V and\ncapitalism have a lot to answer for.\nAlthough that \u201choliday\u201d has passed\nus by, what this collection of photographs gives us is a celebration of love,\nfriendship, youth, fashion, sexuality,\nfreedom, expression, freedom of expression and freedom of fashion and\nfeeling. And we don\u2019t need any excuse\nto celebrate all those wondrous things\nin an age which is becoming ever more\n\u201c1984\u201d (God help us). And what better\nplace to hold such a collection than in\nCarnabyStreet,W1.Nestledawayfrom\nthe hoards swarming over Oxford and\nRegent Streets, Carnaby is an age-old\nSneaky Kissing in Carnaby Street\ninstitution, particularly trendy in the\nSixties. It remains an absolute delight\nwith its quaint cobbles and boutique\nselection of stores. When (not if) I am\nslightly richer, I will spend my money\nhere instead of at the often character-less designers of Bond Street. Enough\nof this and back to the photographs.\nGregg Stone is the photographer who\nhas worked with many fashion brands\nfor magazines, on campaigns for West\nEnd shows (such as the Pet Shop Boys\nmusical) and, more interestingly, has\nworked on an evening of Burlesque for\nStephen Fry at couture house Hardy\nAmies. His inspiration was the Robert\nDoisineau\u2019s iconic \u201cKiss\u201d, and so he set\nabout capturing kisses in the Carnaby\narea and compiling them all in time for\nValentine\u2019s day.\nDespite the slightly shabby, bland\nand unprofessional appearance of the\nCarnaby, its redeeming qualities are\nthe art on show and the massive red lips\ncouch featured in many of the works.\nHere one sees men and men, women\nand women, men and women, woman\nand mannequin, friends and some\npeople looking as if they have just met.\nWhat is interesting is the sheer range of\nsubjects, backdrops, fashion, emotion\nand finishing effects. The kisses range\nfrom happy, passionate, silly, romantic,\nepic Hollywood and, even, indifferent!\nColour is a key feature in all of them:\nvivid and mirroring the vibe of Carnaby Street perfectly. Some of the photos\nare left untouched, where as some have\nbeen enhanced to resemble something\nmore surreal and psychedelic. The\nnames themselves are enticing: Lips in\nMotion, Fur Coat Kiss, Kiss Me, Love\nCaz Knight\nLife, Gothic Kiss. With only 32 photos\nto look round, I strongly urge everyone\nto go and have a look before the exhibition closes. With so many exquisite\nshops to peruse afterwards, the visit\nis well worth it. The \u201cgallery\u201d is also\nrunning a competition where one can\nwin a romantic weekend for two in\nCarnaby including a stay in a five star\nhotel and dinner at a Michelin Guide\nThai restaurant. The Carnaby is open\n11am-6pm and is located right opposite Soccer Scene (Beak Street end of\nCarnaby Street). Until 16 March.\nRobert Doisneau\u2019s Kiss alongside a modern interpretation\n\n"

That\nis, food that has been altered from the\nway in which nature presented it to\nus, in some kind of factory, as part of\na bulk process. It is believed that all\nprocessed food is bad for our health in\ndifferent degrees, and it is best avoided\nfrom our diet altogether.\nThere are three big problems with\nprocessed food \u2013 what is added, what\nis removed and what is left. In short,\nthe whole thing.\nFood additives are what are added to\nprocessed food. These have been used\nby for centuries. Salt, sugar and vinegar\nwere among the first used to preserve\nfoods. However, in the past 30 years,\nwith the prominence of processed\nfoods, there has been a massive explosion of foods with additives, which is a\nmuch more serious problem.\nAdditives are used in food to keep it\nlasting longer and to make it taste, look\nand smell like something that it is not.\nThey enable food to sit on a supermarket shelf, or in our cupboards, for several months without going bad.\nProcessed foods have been altered\nfrom their natural state for safety reasons and for convenience. The methods used for processing foods include\ncanning, freezing, refrigeration, dehydration and aseptic processing.\nWe tend to think of processed foods\nas bad, but it turns out that many processed foods are not unhealthy. For\nexample, milk would be considered a\nprocessed food because it is pasteurized to kill bacteria and homogenized\nto keep fats from separating. While\nsome people prefer to drink raw milk,\nmost of us should consume the \u201cprocessed\u201d version we find in our grocery\nstores.\nAnother healthy example of food\nprocessing is frozen vegetables. While\nfresh may be best, freezing vegetables\npreserves vitamins and minerals and\nmakes them convenient to cook and\neat all year around. Fruit and vegetable juice is also an example of a healthy\nprocessed food. In fact, some orange\njuice is fortified with calcium to make\nit even more nutritious.\nOf course, there are a lot of processed foods that aren\u2019t good for you.\nMany processed foods are made with\ntrans fats, saturated fats, and large\namounts of sodium and sugar. These\ntypes of foods should be avoided, or at\nleast eaten sparingly. Processed foods\nthat may not be as healthy as fresh\nfoods include:\n\u2022 Canned foods with lots of\nsodium\n\u2022 White breads and pastas made\nwith refined white flour, which are\nnot as healthy as those made with\nwhole grains\n\u2022 Packaged high-calorie snack\nfoods, like chips and cheese snacks\n\u2022 High-fat convenience foods, like\ncans of ravioli\n\u2022 Frozen fish sticks and frozen\ndinners\n\u2022 Packaged cakes and cookies\n\u2022 Boxed meal mixes\n\u2022 Sugary breakfast cereals\n\u2022 Processed meats\nProcessed foods and pre-packaged\nmeals are very convenient and popular.\nIf you do shop for these foods, be sure\nto look for products that are made with\nwhole grains, low in sodium and calo-ries, and free of trans fats. Make sure\nyou pay attention to serving size, too,\nand balance out the processed foods\nyou eat with a delicious fresh salad and\nsome whole grain bread. We should\neat as many raw foods as we can daily.\nAdding fresh fruits and vegetables to\nour meals and snacks is an easy way to\naccomplish this.\nEliminating all processed food is\nprobably not going to happen for most\nof us. But we can make better food\nchoices and supplement our diets with\nmissing components. We can opt for\nthe apple over the apple juice. We can\nchoose a baked potato or salad over\nchips. We can choose whole-grain\nbread over white bread. We can take\nthe time to read food labels. Chances are if you can\u2019t pronounce it, you\nshouldn\u2019t be eating it. We can choose\nprocessed foods with a very short list\nof ingredients; the longer the list, the\nmore processing involved, and the\nmore nutrition lost.\nOur bodies are amazing, capable\nof extraordinary things. They are designed to filter out toxins at a fast rate.\nThey have a highly sophisticated defence system. They have an amazing\nability to recover from serious damage.\nThe key lies in providing our bodies\nwith the necessary building blocks to\naccomplish what they were designed to\ndo-to keep us alive!\nGil Saville\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nThis week, I\u2019m going to talk about how\ninterval training is an effective way to\nincrease your general and sport related\nfitness amongst other things and that\nwe don\u2019t have to do the same things\nwe\u2019ve always done in the gym if they\u2019re\nnot getting us the results we are after.\nYou may never have heard of interval\ntraining before but it\u2019s the objective of\nthis article to add an effective method\nfor you to get into even better shape, so\nlet\u2019s start off with the basics.\nPut simply, Interval training is an\ninterval of hard work followed by an\ninterval of easier work repeated for\nthe desired time. Some of this article\nwill compare interval training to long\nduration steady state cardiovascular\nwork (40 minutes + on a cardiovascular machine). This is not to say steady\nstate cardiovascular work hasn\u2019t got its\nplace, indeed, before you try interval\ntraining I would suggest you have some\ndegree of aerobic fitness developed by\nsteady state work done on a cardio machine (the treadmill, rower, bike etc\u2026)\nInterval training has been around\nfor many years but gained wider popularity around the early 1950\u2019s when\na Czechoslovakian athlete famed for\nhis gruelling interval workouts won a\nnumber of gold medals in the Olympics of 1948 and 1952. So for people\nplaying sports, interval training also\nhas a high carryover as in many sports\nyou don\u2019t move at the same speed all\nthe time sometimes you may sprint\nother times stand still etc. Even for\nlong distance sports like the marathon,\ninterval training has been proved to increase top speed, acceleration and the\nability to sprint finish!\nInterval training utilises the aerobic\nsystem and the anaerobic or alactic\nsystem (depending on the nature of\nthe intervals) to produce energy. In the\nhard interval the anaerobic or alactic\nsystem will be the main system working while when in the easier interval\nthe aerobic system will be working,\nwhat this means is the easier interval\nis needed for recovery so you can continue with the high amount of intensity\nin the hard interval.\nMany studies have been carried out\non interval training \u2013 one study compared three 20 minute interval sessions\na week with three 60-90 minute steady\nstate aerobic sessions a week with both\ngroups improving the same amount, so\nin terms of saving time with interval\ntraining you could get the same results\nnearly 5 times quicker!\nIncreases in fitness, a higher body fat\n% loss and a higher increase in metabolism are just some of the other findings\nfor interval training, one study found\nthat after just two weeks fat oxidation\nhad improved by 36% with interval\ntraining!\nBelow are some examples of how you\ncan start interval training, this is just\na guide and will change depending on\nyour goals and fitness levels.\nRemember this is not to say you\nshould never do steady state aerobic\nwork, only that there are definite advantages to varying the things you do\nand interval training is just another\ntool in your toolbox you can use to\nachieve your fitness goals.\nInterval training\nBen Richens\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nType Easy interval\n(length/intensity*)\nHard interval\n(length/intensity*)\nDuration\nBeginner 90 seconds/60-70% 45 seconds/75-85% 15-20 minutes\nShort distance sport \u2013\nBadminton, etc\u2026\n60 seconds/60-70% 10 seconds/95-100% 10-15 minutes\nMid distance sport \u2013\nHockey, rugby, etc\u2026\n2-3 minutes/60-70% 20-30 seconds/85-95% 15-25 minutes\nLong distance sport\n\u2013 Rowing, marathon\netc\u2026\n2-3 minutes/60-70% 1-2 minutes/80-90% 20-30 minutes\nGood, old fashioned, processed SPAM!\n\n"

I\u2019ll give\nyou some goddamn rage,\nand you can feel like the\nsaviourofthestudentbody,\nencouraging us to voice our opinions\nin some violent verbal outpouring of\nthe worst kind. We\u2019ll even make them\nfunny, as some kind of homage to you.\nSo yeah, there\u2019s loads of stuff I\u2019m\nangry about. I hate having to do compulsory \u201cprofessional skills courses\u201d\nas part of my degree (Imperial: \u201cJump\nthrough this hoop!\u201d Me: \u201cOf course,\nbut owing to the strength of gravity\non our planet and my mass and the\nstrength in my stocky little legs (null), I\ncan only reach a trajectory with maximum height of 3 inches, when the\nwind speed is less than or equal to\u2026\u201d).\nI hate that you\u2019re not allowed to take\nhot drinks into the library, (Security\nguard: \u201cDrink it out here.\u201d Me: \u201cArgh,\nnow I\u2019ve burnt my tongue.\u201d) I hate that\nnot all the candidates I voted for in the\nsabb elections got in. I hate that some\npeople slag Fairtrade off and everyone\nelse has investment banking intern-ships. I hate it when my boyfriend calls\nme \u201cTiny Schizo.\u201d\nSo there it is, a nice little self-con-tained rant about how shit my life is.\nYou\u2019ve got my opinions on practically every issue, just like you wanted.\nHappy?\nMy point is, why promote all this\nanger and discontent? Why should we\nhave a competition in which the sole\npurpose is to wax lyrical about your\nproblems, your opinions? Can\u2019t we all\njust be less selfish and start admitting\nthat it\u2019s rather funny that despite 3\ncompulsory professional skills workshops my CV still only reads: \u201cfemale,\n24yo, GSOH, seeks employer for job\nand maybe more\u2026\u201d, that I\u2019m clearly not\ngoing to get a job in investment banking with a CV like that even if I\u2019d have\nwanted to, and that I\u2019d rather have to\ndrink my coffee in the JCR than have\nsome bastard spill his over my stuff in\nthe library.\nEveryone needs to get some perspective about this; we\u2019re all so spoilt and\noverindulged. (Apart from the Tiny\nSchizo nickname. Wanker.)\nAngry Geek should stick to what he\u2019s\ngood at, writing funny columns about\nsituations we all find ourselves in. And\nthe rest of us will read them and think,\nyeah, you got it right, I can relate to\nthat, and although it pissed me off at\nthe time, your take on it\u2019s quite funny.\nAnd instead of Angry Geek Idol, I\nthink we should have a Hug Day, much\nlike that \u201cHug a [insert name of ethnicity or religion here] Day\u201ds that were so\nwell publicised on Facebook. But this\nwould be for everyone, hippyish as that\nmight sound, from the Finance Tart to\nthe JCR sandwich shop staff. We all\nneed it.\nIf you\u2019ve got issues, or a hard on,\nNeedy McNeedy can help you out in\neither case. Email agony.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk.\nRage against the Geek\nNeedy McNeedy\nI\nam a passionate Union non-voter. I don\u2019t vote for anything\nin the Union, and am extraordinarily happy not voting for the\nUnion.\nThis is because firstly I am incredibly\nlazy, and I don\u2019t think that voting for\nthe Union President will make any particular difference.\nFor a start, it always seems to be the\nsame faces that are running for these\npositions. That bores me.\nNot that it\u2019s a bad thing that the same\npeople are always running. People are\nallowed to have dreams, and I can\u2019t\nfault them for that. I\u2019m just saying\u2026.\nI\u2019d like to have candidates who are like\nme. Candidates who have a sense of\nhumour, and can identify with normal\nstudents.\nThis is where my problem starts.\nMany of the people who stand for the\nUnion positions are not normal stu-dents. I\u2019m not talking about your usual\ngarden variety freaks and geeks. I\u2019m\ntalking about \u201cserial Sabbaticals\u201d. People who have spent most of their university life working directly within the\nstinking bowels of the Union.\nPeople seem to think that somehow\nthis is a good thing. Perhaps the candidate\u2019s experiences working for the Union make them better than common\nfolk. I think that this is the completely\nwrong perspective to take. Candidates\nshould be common folk.\nThe whole purpose of the Student\nUnion is to look after, and cater for the\nneeds of a university\u2019s student body.\nThe Sabbaticals of the Union are there\nto make sure that the views of the student body are represented during all\ntheir dealings with the college. They are\nalso there to make sure that the Union\nitself caters to the tastes and needs of\nits students. They are the crucial link\nbetween the average student and the\nUnion. When this system works prop-erly, everyone is happy.\nHowever, let\u2019s say you have someone who\u2019s worked for the Union for\na year. This person knows exactly the\nright things to say to people during a\ncampaign. He/she has experience of\nwinning elections, which gives them\nan advantage over new candidates.\nHowever, unlike the new candidates,\nthis person has been out of education\nfor a year. They have been sequestered\nin a water-tight bubble away from student life. They deal with so many of the\nUnion\u2019s problems on a day to day basis,\nthat they are essentially isolated from\nnormal students.\nBut of course these people believe\nthey can do better next year, now that\nthey know how everything works.\nThey can get everything done much\nmore efficiently this time \u2018round. Maybe this time they can \u201cactually\u201d make\na difference. This time, maybe they\ncan follow through with some of the\npromises they originally made. Except,\naren\u2019t they missing the point?\nShouldn\u2019t they let someone else take\nthe job, someone who has been in full-time education, someone who can still\nremember what it was like to go to\nlectures? Someone who may be inex-perienced, but still understands what is\nimportant to a student\u2019s life, and what\nis not?\nBy voting \u201cSerial Sabbaticals\u201d in we\nare voting for people who represent\nthe Union, rather than people who\nrepresent the students.\nBecause of this, our Union has grown\ninto an autonomous monster, separate\nfrom College, and separate from stu-dents, catering only to itself. We get\nsituations where we have candidates\nrunning for President who have been\nout of university longer than the majority of students at Imperial have been\nin university. If there was one way in\nwhich I think the Union could be made\na better place is if these people were\nforcibly banned from standing. We already have a rule saying that no Sabbatical can run for the same position\nagain the next year. Why not extend it,\nand have a rule that prevents any previous Sabbatical running for another\nUnion position?\nMaybe if this were the case, we could\nget a different crop of applicants for\nthe Union. Perhaps we\u2019d get students\nwho actually represent students, rather\nthan any one club or society. Perhaps\nthe CV whores would decide that perhaps getting a year long internship in\nindustry would look better on their CV\nthan a year in student politics. But how\nthe hell am I supposed to know, I can\u2019t\ntell the future; I\u2019m just another defective brain.\nJust one rule\u2026\nDefective Brain\nB\neing of Chinese origin but\nhaving grown up in Britain, I had always felt I was\nout of touch with my own\nculture. Therefore, when I\ncame to Imperial I was eager to participate in a Chinese society, under\nthe somewhat naive impression that I\nwould surely be getting involved with\nsomething distinctly Chinese. Flicking through the pages of the freshers\u2019\nhandbook I was admittedly puzzled\nbut also impressed by the presence of\nnot one, but three different societies\npurporting to promote Chinese cul-ture. However, not wanting to miss out\non anything, I signed up to the mailing\nlists of all three.\nSoon, invitations to attend various\nclub nights arrived in my inbox. It\nseemed each of the Chinese societies\nhad hit on the same ingenious idea on\nhow to break the ice.\nStill unclear on the differences between the societies I chose one pretty\nmuch at random to attend. Price-wise,\nit was definitely not a student-friendly\nevent, but as it was being held at one\nof the well-known London clubs I decided it would be worth going along to.\nIt turned out to be ridiculously over-subscribed, and despite having arrived\npretty early I still ended up spending\nthree long hours of my freshers\u2019 week\nqueuing outside a well-known club in\nLondon, only to receive an apology\nand a refund. So my first experience\nwas not exactly a great success, and I\nconfess I was pretty disappointed. But\nI thought it was only fair to give them\na second chance, and so when more\ninvitations in a similar vein appeared I\ndecided to try again.\nI actually ended up attending several\nmore club nights throughout the year,\nsampling what each of the different societies had to offer. And although I did\nmanage to at least get in each time, they\nwere all cripplingly expensive affairs.\nOften they would also be massively\noversold, which meant long queues\nand plenty of standing around, despite\narriving at ridiculously early hours.\nEach time I left with my wallet feeling\nconsiderably lighter but without feeling any closer to either my culture or\nmy fellow clubbers. The societies were\ncertainly providing me with ample opportunity for clubbing, but where were\nthe opportunities to exchange our\nshared backgrounds? Where were the\nopportunities to explore our country\u2019s\nheritage? Where were the opportunities to discuss the issues facing China\ntoday? None of the societies seemed\ninterested in catering to these needs.\nSure, I can understand that for any\noverseas club, a major role is to help\nforeign students settle in at an understandably difficult time in their lives;\nfaced with an unfamiliar culture, a different language, the prospect of possibly living away from home for the\nfirst time and on top of that the considerable pressure of having to achieve\nacademically.\nSo yes, I agree social events are im-portant. And the societies do arrange\nfootball training, basketball sessions,\nand the occasional trips to amusement\nparks as well as club nights. But it was\nthe continued absence of anything really related to Chinese culture that\nrankled me. How can these societies\njustify the \u201cChinese\u201d in their names?\nAre they nothing more than a means\nto gather together people of a certain\nethnic group just so they can go clubbing and play sports together rather\nthan along with the rest of the college?\nI cannot help but feel there is something fundamentally wrong with this\npicture.\nIs there really no hunger for something more substantial? After all, there\nare few things in life more fundamental\nthan our identities; they define who we\nare and our culture is an integral part\nof this identity.\nFor foreign students still adjusting\nto a strange new environment, what\ncan be more comforting than finding\ncommon ground with people whom,\nalthough seemingly very different, ultimately share the same culture? And\nto be able to celebrate and have pride\nin that culture; I believe this to be infinitely more satisfying than any club.\nSo what has caused this rut, this decided lack of passion? I do not know\nthe answer. Is it mere apathy? Is it a\nlack of confidence? Is it a belief that no\none cares? Whatever the reason I feel it\nis important to overcome it. Only then\ncan we gain respect as individuals, as a\nculture, as a nation.\nMy Orientation course\nBamboo Writer\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12 felix Friday 7 March 2008\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 Li-Teck Lau and Kadhim Shubber\nHillary: a very female candidate\nAbioye Oyetunji on why Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign hurts and is detrimental to the feminist cause\nA\nwoman becoming \u201cthe\nmost powerful man in\nthe world\u201d should surely\nbe the climax of female\nempowerment, and the\nfact that this year marked the first realistic possibility of this occurring should\nput the Hillary Rodham Clinton name\nright up there with Joan of Arc and\nBoudicca. Instead, the comparisons I\njust made probably made you snort in\ndisbelief. Rather than proclaiming this\nas a historically important moment in\nthe struggle, the feminist powers-that-be have all but ignored Mrs Clinton\u2019s\nWhite House bid.\nIt\u2019s not that having a female American President wouldn\u2019t be a good thing;\nit\u2019s a position of great, if often overstat-ed, importance and, if she were to be\nsuccessful, just one term could silence\nhordes of disbelievers in sexual equality just as Margaret Thatcher did in the\nseventies.\nWhat diminishes this potentially\nhistoric achievement is the woman\nin question seeming to owe all her\nachievements to, you guessed it, a man.\nIt doesn\u2019t help when the one in question is a smooth-talking, skirt-chasing\nspecimen, who once sexually pleasured\na 22-year old intern with a cigar in the\nOval Office (possibly the most chauvinist act one could possibly imagine).\nUnfortunately, as far as we all can\ntell, the only reason Hillary Clinton\nmanaged to get a shot at being the\n44th President is because she is married to the 42nd. It did not have to\nbe so glaring \u2013 Hillary could possibly\nhave convinced everyone of her independence had she kept Bill in the\nbackground for the entire campaign\nand dissociated herself from his ad-ministration. Instead, he was brought\nto the forefront, sending an unforgivable message: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can\nvote for the wife, it\u2019ll still be Bill running the show\u201d. Mr. Clinton has even\ngone as far as performing tasks usually\nreserved only for the candidate, such\nas bargaining with party bigwigs such\nas Ted Kennedy, implying Mrs Clinton\ndoes not have the negotiating abilities\nto do so (a strange message to send for\na Presidential candidate).\nComparisons to other female world\nleaders paint Mrs. Clinton\u2019s independence issues in a particularly bad light.\nAngela Merkel\u2019s husband is famously\ninvisible; he is known as \u201cthe Phantom\nof the Opera\u201d in the German press.\nJokes abound that Denis Thatcher\nused to attend the \u201cmothers\u2019 teas\u201d\nevents when their son, Mark, was at\nHarrow. Hillary, on the other hand,\nhas not just made it clear her husband\nwill be playing a key, potentially lead,\nrole in her administration, but has tirelessly traded on his name, attempting\nto take credit for his achievements in\nthe White House (except where said\nachievements are no longer popular, in\nwhich case she actually disagreed with\nthem the entire time).\nBut it is not just the prominence of\nher husband that makes her a bad candidate for a female role model. In order\nto play to votes, Mrs. Clinton has committed some horrendous feminist nono\u2019s on the campaign trail.\nPlaying to female stereotypes may\nhelp win votes, but once this election season is over and the dust set-tles, she may have a lot to answer for\nwith Women\u2019s Lib groups who do not\nconsider such behaviour helpful in the\nlong run.\nFirst, and most glaring, was the teary\nmoment before the New Hampshire\nprimary. Certainly there are valid reasons a candidate might shed a tear\nduring their campaign; when giving a\nmoving talk on the death of a family\nmember, while listening to a war casualty\u2019s mother describe his heroics, or\nwhen visiting the cancer ward of a children\u2019s hospital. However, choking up\nbecause you are losing in opinion polls\nshould spell the end of your candidacy\n(and I daresay, if Hillary had been a\nman, it would have). Voters (predomi-nantly female) rallied around her over\nthis moment, and she won the primary.\nIf the first female American President\ngets there on a wave of national pity,\nthe Women\u2019s Lib movement could be\nput back decades.\nWhen the press started to ignore her\nafter losing a long series of primaries,\nMrs Clinton kicked up a strop-fest\nof claims of unfair treatment (even\nthough the press does this to virtually all candidates who seem unlikely\nto win). Graduating from there, Mrs\nClinton\u2019s recent strategy has been to\nHillary Clinton has the chance to be the most powerful individual on Earth, but is it a triumph for female empowerment?\npropagate another stereotype by engaging in severe mood swings; one day\nshe is telling us how proud she is to be\nrunning against Barack Obama, the\nnext she is virulently berating him for\nreasons no one can understand. I have\nno idea how or why this strategy was\nexpected to work politically, but it\u2019s essentially a gift on a golden platter for\nany sexist observers.\nI feel sorry for Hillary because she\nis likely an intelligent and competent\nwoman. My guess is that she is probably a cool-headed and rational think-er, with good decision-making skills.\nHowever, she has chosen to play all this\ndown in her campaign and play political games that only make her seem\ndesperate, badly organised and unsta-ble. However, American voters can rest\nassured, the Clinton campaign insists;\nher man\u2019s supervising.\nNews stories from around the known world\nIn depth political analysis is so 1980\u2019s.\nBack then shoulder pads weren\u2019t ironic.\nAs a fully paid up member of the iPod\ngeneration, I too find it hard to consume news not set out sparsely amid\npretty pictures.\nVenezuela prepares for war\nVenezuela has mobilised troops along\nits border with Columbia, with estimates of several hundred tanks being\nquoted by the Reuters news agency.\n\u201cThe concept of our mobilization is not\nagainst the people of Colombia ... but\nagainst the expansionist ambitions of\nthe (U.S.) empire\u201d Venezuela\u2019s defence\nminister said. Columbia recently sent\nspecialist forces into Ecuador with the\naim of killing communist rebels it sees\nas a threat. Chavez, who is a staunch\nally of President Correa of Ecuador,\nbelieves the move is part of a US lead\ncampaign to destabilise socialist South\nAmerica. Major regional power Brazil\nhas urged restraint in a crisis that could\nplunge the continent into war.\nNo Lisbon Treaty referendum\nThe UK parliament decided in a vote\nof 311 to 248 not to hold a national\nreferendum on whether to ratify the\nEU Lisbon Treaty. The conservative\nparty claims that the latest treaty to\ncome out of Brussels infringes on Britain\u2019s sovereignty and requires a public\nvote. The Liberal Democrats, who\nhave fallen significantly in the opinion\npolls since David Cameron because\nleader of the opposition, appear to\nhave been the biggest casualties how-ever, with 13 MPs defying a 3-line-whip to abstain from voting, seeing\nno less than 3 front bench politicians\nresign. Ratification will now be passed\nonto the House of Lords.\nDon\u2019t forget to pay your gas bill\nThe Russian petroleum company\nGazprom halved its supplies of natural gas over two days last week to the\nUkraine, following a dispute in which\nthe Eastern European country is alleged to owe US$600m to the oil gi-ant. It raised eyebrows of concern in\nWestern Europe, which relies heavily\non energy resources from Russia, some\n80% flowing through Ukrainian pipes.\nThe move comes mere days after\nDmitry Medvedev, chair of the board\nof Gazprom, won Russia\u2019s Presidential\nelections, and is a further worsening\nof relations between formerly united\ncountries since pro-west President\nYushchenko came to power in 2004.\nClinton clings on\nOver in the US, the marathon selection process for Presidential candidates in November\u2019s election to succeed George Bush continues. John\nMcCain finally triumphed in the race\nfor the Republican Party nomination,\nreceiving the incumbent\u2019s blessing on\nWednesday, and Hillary Clinton gained\nground after last week\u2019s series of primaries dubbed \u2018Super Tuesday Part II\u201d.\nMrs Clinton ended a losing streak of\n11 states and avoided possible knock\nout by winning major states Texas and\nOhio. There have since been talks of\nrunning together against Mr McCain\nas both candidates prepare for a contest which may run into late summer.\nLi-Teck Lau\nPolitics Editor\n\n"

Head straight up the stairs\nin front of you, into the first room, if\nyou don\u2019t know what music you\u2019re\nhearing\u2026 That\u2019s a good thing, embrace the fact that you\u2019re finally in a\nclub where the DJs are artists, not just\npeople who know how to fade from\none track to another. Caf\u00e9 1001 has a\ngreat variety of music, live acts and international DJ\u2019s from soul to electro to\nhouse to dub. Stop for a moment and\ntake in your surroundings.\nThe d\u00e9cor is relaxed and the lighting gives you a feeling of sepia-toned\nhappiness; throw your self down onto\nthe cushions or grab a couple of sofas\nand\u2026 chill.\nIt\u2019s time to get down to the basics -drinks. Head on through into the second room, ignore the forty year-old\nman in a babygrow dancing in a circle\nand go straight to the bar. You\u2019ve got a\ngreat variety of drinks, from cocktails\nto cans of beer and they are reasonably priced. Not as cheap as CheapIt really is the club that has everything. Even a policeman pretending to sell crack\n30\nnightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix Friday 7 March 2008\nNightlife\nNightlife Editor \u2013 Francesca O\u2019Hanlon\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the right attitude, no problems\u201d, booms the doorman as I\u2019m ushered inside Caf\u00e9 1001; a unique venue\nthat you\u2019d be foolish to avoid. This is a\ncaf\u00e9/bar/club that says no to queuing\nfor entry, monotonous nights out and\nunimaginative music.\nSituated at the end of Brick Lane,\nthe venue is the perfect place for an\nall-round night out. Burgers, chips, baguettes and even fruit are all available\nat 1001- this is like no other club you\u2019ve\nbeen to before. Revellers congregate\noutside smoking, talking and eating;\nthere\u2019s seating provided in the form\nof picnic tables. You might have made\nsome guesses about the dress code by\nthis point. Curries, Burgers and picnic tables do not mix with expensive\ndresses and brand new loafers. Leave\nall the pretentious West End bullshit\nbehind and dress like an interesting\nhuman being. Think more Crackbitch\nthan Jack Wills. At the very least, dress\nlike a NORMAL human being.\nAt some point, you\u2019re going to have to\ngo inside, so you know\u2026 go inside. No\nneed to phone a friend to get yourself\nHow many times have you stood on a\ndance floor, looked about, and wondered how many people around you\nare actually feeling the music being\nplayed?\nIn my opinion, too many clubs are\nbeing filled with people who are there\nsolely because they want to get pickled\nand not really because of a love of the\nmusic. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a\ngood pickling, but I hate getting onto\na dance floor, where the atmosphere\ncreated by a DJ rocking the crowd is\nlost because people are hearing but not\nfeeling their work.\nHowever, last week at Fabric was dif-ferent. For a club which consistently\nplays host to the best in breaks and\ndrum \u2018n\u2019 bass, even a casual Thursday\nnight was huge. The complete range\nof breakbeat\u2019s finest performed, from\nlegends such as Krafty Kuts, through\nto newskoolers such as Rektchordz, all\nin aid of the 7th annual International\nBreakbeat Awards.\nEven in the international room, displaying breaks from across Europe,\nthe atmosphere was massive. Every\ntime the b-lines dropped, the floor\nwent crazy, the highlight for me was\nhow much DJ Deekline rocked Room\nTwo. Everyone in that room was hanging by his every mix, scratch and drop.\nThis reminded me of what breaks is\nabout, loving the driving bass lines and\npounding beats.\nThe best DJ award went to Stanton\nWarriors and best producer to Plump\nDJs, who also picked up Best Single\nand Best Label.\nAlas, now only 12 months until the\n8th annual championships, which I am\nmost certainly planning to go to. Not\nfor the awards themselves, but for the\natmosphere and DJs that made it an incredible night out.\nJack Massey\nH\noly cow, it\u2019s been a hectic week. Well not really,\nI had one big night and\nthen five days recover-ing, but it was worth it.\nOn Thursday last week, me and Jack\nheaded down to Fabric for the Breakbeat championships. While I could\nchitter on for hours about how good it\nwas, instead, I would like to discuss the\nFabric bouncers. I hate bouncers. They\nare rude, aggressive and just generally\npatronising. Why do they feel it necessary to just screw up a night by being\nabsolute arseholes? For example; Why\ndo they always make you feel so guilty\nabout being drunk? Everyone is drunk,\nit\u2019s a Friday night, even your parents\nare sitting at home watching Have I\nGot News For You with several bottles\nof wine giggling at the topical humour\nthat they explain to you that you will\nnot find funny because you have not\nread nearly enough of The Times/\nGuardian/Independent. Anyway my\npoint was that bouncers are fannies\nand here is a perfectly good example of\ntheir fanniness in action:\nBOUNCER: No you can\u2019t come back\nin you\u2019re drunk.\nCLUBMAN/WOMAN/ME: I\u2019m not\ndrunk, I always throw up in my bra and\nthen put it back on...\nBOUNCER: No you don\u2019t.\nCLUBMAN/WOMAN/ME: Yes I do\nBOUNCER: No you don\u2019t.\nCLUBMAN/WOMAN/ME: Yes I do\nBOUNCER: No you don\u2019t.\nCLUBMAN/WOMAN/ME: Yes I do\nBOUNCER: No you don\u2019t.\nCLUBMAN/WOMAN/ME: Yes I do\nBOUNCER: No you don\u2019t.\nCLUBMAN/WOMAN/ME: Yes I do\nBOUNCER: Then you need to sort\nyour fucking life out.\nAnywho, so after this event, I wasn\u2019t\nexpecting much politeness from the\nFabric bouncers when, at six in the\nmorning, as the club was closing, I ran\nback downstairs for a wee. All the toilets were locked, but instead of laughing at me as I got more and more red in\nthe face trying to hold it in, they ushered me into a little building connected\nto Fabric, (turned out to be the head\nbouncer\u2019s house) let me do my busi-ness, then offered me a cup of tea! I politely declined (too much weeing) and\nthey walked me out, made sure I didn\u2019t\nget into a shitty minicab where I would\nbe offered champagne and then killed,\nand bid me farewell. Although a small\ninteraction, it was a very important\none, because it completely restored my\nfaith in bouncers. Well done big hench-Fabric-men in bomber jackets.\nSo that is it for this week. If you too\nhave a new found love of bouncers, you\ncan write in to tell me, or if you want\nto write a review, that\u2019s also very wel-come. Or in fact for any reason write\nin at nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nAlso if anyone has any funny stories\nof nights out, send them in. Mainly\nfor my enjoyment, but who knows- we\nmay print them too! As always, have a\nmessy week, not so much so that you\nwet yourself but more so than going\nwild and spending an extra 50p on the\nitbox.\nI hate to admit it, but with exams around the corner it might be time\nto start hitting the books rather than hitting the London nightlife.\nBefore all that though, why not have one last week to clear your\nhead (and your bank account). Here\u2019s a week of some varied East\nLondon club nights, sure to satisfy your need for good music and\nbeverages.\nSunday 9th March \u2013 Clockwork Bar \u2013 Islington: 5 squid after 9pm.\nSunday night doesn\u2019t have to be one of rest, why not ramp up\nthe intensity with a night of drum and bass at Clockwork Bar? The\nfortnightly Metalheadz Sunday Sessions is a great way to end your\nweekend with a bang.\nMonday 10th March \u2013 Cargo \u2013 ILUVLIVE: \u00a36 in advance, \u00a38 on the\ndoor. For Monday we have some live music, with the ILUVLIVE UK\nUrban Showcase at Cargo in the East End. Featuring artists such\nas Taio Cruz, Bashy and beatboxing from Faith SFX, it\u2019s something\ndifferent at a cool venue.\nWednesday 12th March \u2013 Dogstar \u2013 Brixton 808 Volt: Free Entryfrom 4pm-2am. It\u2019s halfway through the week now, and time for\nsomething a little different. Dosgstar, in Brixton, is the \u2018first DJ bar\nin London\u2019 and plays a variety of music including Brazilian, Latin Hip\nHop and Baille Funk. Drinks are cheap and with free entry it\u2019s worth\na look instead of your standard Wednesday night.\nSaturday 15th March \u2013 Sosho \u2013 2 Tabernacle St, EC2A\nLasermagnetic: \u00a35 entry-9pm-4am. Last but by no means least,\nSosho on a Saturday showcase Lasermagnetic. A night of cool\nelectronic disco, they mix some great cocktails and you\u2019ll be rubbing\nshoulders with a very international crowd.\nAlistair Owen\nThe best of East London in the\nupcoming week (Look forward to\nsome long bus journeys home)\nskates but less expensive than West\nEnd clubs. A can of Red Stripe is \u00a32.40.\nEither way, it\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun to\nlie back on a sofa, sip your beer and\nwatch some tripped out guy dancing\nby himself.\nThe only fault of the club is the fact\nthat it closes at 12pm. However this\nisn\u2019t really a problem because there\nare many other clubs and pubs in the\nsurrounding area. Regardless of what\nyou\u2019re looking for- clubbing, food, con-versation, techno, live music,a heavy\nnight, a chilled night- Caf\u00e9 1001 has\ngot it. It\u2019s even been in a music video \u2013\ncheck out Bloc Party\u2019s \u2018Prayer\u2019.\nYou\u2019d have to be crazy not to put\nCaf\u00e9 1001 at the top of your to-do list,\nso gather your mates and get down to\nBrick Lane for food, dancing and fun\nthe likes of which you\u2019ll never find in\nthe West End.\nFabric hosts the Breakbeat Awards\nCafe 1001.

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n46 Friday 7 March 2008\nfelix\nSport\nIC Boat Club\u2019s women successfully gain starting\nplaces for next year\u2019s WeHoRR participants\nThe 68th annual Women\u2019s Eights Head\nof the River Race (WEHoRR) took\nplace last Saturday 1st March at 10am\nfrom Mortlake to Putney.\nThe processional rowing race takes\nplace on the outgoing tide with the\nwinner completing the course in the\nfastest time. IC was represented by a\nwomen\u2019s senior eight (S2), a women\u2019s\nnovice eight (Novice Acad), and by\nJenny Forrester in a London composite\nentry (S1). Each crew lines up sequentially and is timed over the 4.25 mile\ndistance. Not only are crews racing for\nvictory but their finishing placement\ndetermines the clubs starting places\nthe following year.\nWeeks of gruelling land and water\nsessions under the iron fist of Coach\nJames Blackley had the novice crew\nprepared in peak physical condition.\nThe novice boat, of which I am seven\nof nine, was assigned number 239 of\n251 due to there being no novice entry last year. Fire raged in the belly of\neach crew member after some inspiring motivational speaking from James\nand senior women\u2019s coach Ross Smitheman before setting off from the IC\nboathouse on Putney embankment.\nAlthough initially impeded by some\nsteering-deficient crews, top Cox Katie Oliver impressively manoeuvred\nus across the river to our designated\nbanking position just short of Barnes\nBridge. At 10 am the Saxon sounded\nand soon the first crew from Thames\nRC came hurtling under the bridge towards Putney. IC\u2019s Jenny Forrester followed in boat two, looking powerful in\nseat four.\nChristina Duffy After watching a hundred or so crews\npass, the Marshal\u2019s herded the rest of\nthe crews up to the starting position.\nWe crawled our way towards Chiswick\nBridge keeping in along the bank as\nthe racing boats continued to pulse towards the finish. As we emerged under\nChiswick Bridge we were met by strong\nwinds, water traffic and shallow waters\nalong the bank causing early concern\nfor crews trying to prevent fin damage\nto their boats.\nTension mounted as boats up ahead\nbegan to spin around for the race\nwind-up. Nervous chatter was hushed\nand crew members stripped down into\ntheir racing gear. It was after 11 am and\nwe had been on the water for 2 hours\nkeeping warm and focused. We took\nthe psychological advantage when\nseveral of our crew members had no\nchoice but to relieve themselves over\nboard; shocking opponent crews before the turn and giving them something to visualise for the next seven\nkilometres.\nWith the boat lighter we spun round\nand set off at full concentration towards the start line at Chiswick Bridge.\nStroke Selina Graham set us off into a\nsteady rhythm before building up the\npressure and increasing the speed to a\nblistering 34 strokes per minute (s/m)\nas we crossed the start line under Chiswick Bridge.\nJust a few strokes into the race the\nblade from Bow\u2019s Kate Wylie came\nloose from the rigger off-setting the\nboat\u2019s balance. We managed to maintain our rating while she swiftly recovered the blade. A few hundred metres\nlater a bang followed by a distressed\ncry of \u2018My seat came off!\u2019 was heard\nfrom seat six Mackenzie Clavin. The\nseat was replaced on the slides impressively fast as the rest of the crew pulled\nharder to maintain speed. Allowing\nno mechanical mishap to stand in our\nway we strengthened and settled into\na steady 32 s/m race-pace rate. Unbeknownst to the rest of the crew further\ndisaster was unravelling as the steering\ncontrols snapped early-on in the race\ncausing difficulty for Cox Katie Oliver\nwho displayed outstanding navigational skills in steering us through the\ncourse in the fastest stream.\nWith technical difficulties behind us\nwe approached and throttled past one-two-three-four-five crews in quick succession leaving them demoralised and\nfeebly paddling in our wake. Motivated\nby their pained expressions we banged\nout the strokes down the Thames towards Hammersmith Bridge. Huge\ncheers from fellow ICBC members\nand family relatives pushed us on away\nfrom the Bridge. Some incredible vocal\nranges were displayed by ICBC\u2019s Adam\nSeward and John Davey.\nHolding our rate we continued steady\nbefore hitting Craven Cottage, an area\nwe had earlier marked as our first push\nfor home. We blistered on, tiring but\nrefusing to slacken off. Our final push\ncame as we passed the ICBC boat\nhouse just a few hundred metres from\nthe finish. With gladiatorial war-cries\nfrom Cox Katie resounding across the\nThames, Selina took the rating up to\n34 s/m for the final push home. With\nevery conceivable muscle aching we\npounded out the closing strokes and\ngrunted our way across the finish; ex-hausted, but elated.\nThe overall Head winner was Osiris\nBC (S2) in a time of 19:32.81. Jenny\nForrester\u2019s composite crew finished\n8th overall, 5th in their category (S1),\nin 19:50.99. IC\u2019s senior women finished\n23rd overall, 7th in their category (S2)\nin a time of 20:14.39. And our novice\ncrew finished 147th overall, 4th in our\ncategory in a time of 22:10.92. This\nmeans a gaining of places by all crews\nfor next years ICBC participants. Well\ndone to everybody involved!\nWith early morning training cancelled on Sunday, post-race festivities\nbegan early with a boathouse crawl\nalong Putney embankment ending up\nin London RC. A great day was had\nby all and we wish the best of luck\nto the men\u2019s crews in anticipation of\nthe Men\u2019s Head of the River Race on\nMarch 15th.\nThis weekend saw a surprising thing\nindeed. Normally creatures of the Union Gym, the members of Imperial\u2019s\nKendo society were instead present in\nEthos. It was \u2018Climb-Fest\u2019 at Ethos, and\ntaking advantage of the situation our\nmembers threw themselves into the\nfray. This event, kindly sponsored by\n\u2018Cotswold outdoor\u2019, featured a climbing competition and also sessions for\nbeginners to tackle the wall under the\nnurturing kindness of specialist in-structors, in our case Ruth and Steve.\nNow lets be honest here, we kendo-ka aren\u2019t normally timid people. We\nusually dress in armour and whack\neach other with big sticks whilst yelling in non-dulcet tones. Such is not\nthe behaviour of people likely to spend\na quiet night in reading a book. However, neither are we prone to going\nvertical. So one or two of our members\nwere a tad nervous.\nActually, we found the session to be\nfun. Not only is there fairly limitless fun\nto be had dangling from a piece of rope,\nbut also the staff and equipment onsite\nat Ethos are top notch. It wasn\u2019t long\nbefore our members were shinning up\nthe walls like there was no tomorrow.\nSo apart from having above-average\nskills with a sword we can now climb,\ntoo. A nifty combination for night time\noccupations of dastardly repute. All\njob requests to be sent via our website.\nSilence assured for a price.\nThis team-building exercise may, in\nsome slight way, have prepared us for\nthe annual University Competition that\ntakes place in two weeks time in Cambridge. At the moment it looks like we\nareup against an assortment of teams\nfrom all over the country. Our old rival UCL is taking part as well as those\nscarfed ne\u2019er-do-wells from Cambridge\nand Oxford, and even some from the\nland of Robert the Bruce. Quite a selec-Kendo club go climbing\nTim Simpson\ntion to test our skills against. We will\nkeep you apprised of our progress.\nNonetheless, even this clash of titans\npales in comparison to the real event of\nthe year: Imperial College Kendo Club\u2019s\n10th Anniversary celebratory competition to be held at the end of May.\nWhich we are sure you are all looking\nforward to of course. So keep your eyes\npeeled for more information.\nThe Kendo team at the foot of the Ethos climbing wall\nThe Women\u2019s boat overtaking the competition\nSo it\u2019s 4am on a Saturday morning, it\u2019s\ncold and dark and the last thing you\nfancy doing is getting up and wearing\nsequins\u2026 right? Well, that was what 60\nof us were doing last Saturday- the Imperial College Dancesport team were\ncompeting in the Southern Universities Competition, the second biggest in\nthe dancing calendar.\nAfter a two hour coach ride, including a (dodgy) breakfast at a service station and half of \u2018Road Trip\u2019 we arrived\nat UWE and jumped straight into the\naction.\nThe morning was dedicated to the\nBallroom side of things and after over\n4 hours of dancing a good set of results\nwas achieved by Imperial. 5 couples\nearned a place in the Intermediate\nsemi-finals, with 5 finalists in Beginners, Novice and Ex-Student. Arman\nSahovic and Anne-Marie Wirth impressively took 4th in the Advanced\nCategory.\nAfter a much deserved break, the\nLatin section kicked off in the after-noon. Again, the dancing went on for\nroughly 4 hours before Imperial had 6\ncouples reaching the finals, with Arman and Nicole Papaioannou coming\n5th in the Advanced final and Chris\nBassett and Chrissy Jackson winning\nthe Intermediate category.\nThe evenings at dance competitions\nare always fun and a lot of competitive\nChristina Jackson energy flies around as every university\ngoes head to head with all the others.\nWith 4 couples reaching the team fi-nals, Imperial once again secured their\n3rd place behind Oxford and Cambridge. Rumour has it that it\u2019s because\nthe Oxford latin girls touch themselves\nmore than ours, but it\u2019s a well known\nfact that Imperial still have the hottest team on the circuit. And by the\nnumber of trophies that travelled back\non the coach with us, Imperial is definitely a force to be reckoned with on\nthe dance floor.\nDance club in Southern\nUniversities competition\nArman and Nicole\n\n"

Under the formula sheet and past\nexam papers, there was a stash a DVD\ncalled \u201cFat Girls 5\u201d and a pink plastic\nreplica of a woman\u2019s, you know, bits. My\nroommate and I lead completely separate lives and don\u2019t really speak. Should\nI confront him about what I saw?\nFannyHowzer\nDear FannyHowzer,\nDefinitely. Fat Girls 5 is the worst in the\nseries of Fat Girls DVDs; you must at\nleast mention the incident so that you\ncan tell him FG5 pales in comparison\nwith FG2 (my personal favourite).

And all this because some Jewish dude died 2000 years (ish) ago, so\nthe name Easter would seem to imply.\nHuh?\nWhat just happened, did I miss\nsomething? So some dude dies and\nonce a year we all celebrate the fact\nthat he\u2019s dead by the consumption of\nvast quantities of cocoa and lard? It\ndoes make you think: What the hell is\nEaster about?\nAll evidence points to it being a good\nexcuse for a holiday especially to break\nup the school year. And for research-ers, a good half-hour away from the office for a knees up.\nIs it the only time of year when you\ncan legitimately express your love for\noversized bunny rabbits?\nOr, was Mel Gibson right in his detailed graphical representation of one\nman\u2019s unrelenting 12-hour torture,\ncomplete with never ending whippage.\nWhatever is closest to the truth, we\ndo know that some dude existed back\nin the day, was nailed to a cross and a\nholiday was set up to commemorate\nthis. How chocolate got involved we\ndon\u2019t know.\nThe dude (here on in referred to as\nJesus) still generates controversy, especially about who he was, and what\nhappened on that cross. Some say he\ndied but somehow just got better, hung\naround for a bit then went to heaven.\nSome say he never died, but minced\noff to some other country, had kids and\nended up in a rocking chair.\nOthers say he was on the cross, but\nhe didn\u2019t die, passed out, and escaped\nfrom his tomb when he regained\nconsciousness.\nConsidering that we\u2019re talking 2000\nyears old, this is one heck of a cold case\nto reopen. But what do you know, some\npeople are gonna try.\nCSI Jerusalem is an attempt by a\nmedical doctor to figure out what hap-pened. Would a human body be able to\nwithstand the kind of abuse portrayed\nby Mister Gibson in his film The Passion of The Christ? Physiologically,\nwhat would actually happen to a person that experienced such abuse? And\ndo the most well known historical accounts of events tally with medical\nfindings?\nSo what of Jesus then, why did he go\nthrough this?

Are we even sure he died\nsometime in the spring of 33 AD? The\nsearch for answers carries on, and\nmaybe CSI Jerusalem can shed some\nlight on all this.

That\nfinal statement is the ultimate double-edged sword though; you usually have\nto rely on other people to survive and\nachieve ultimate victory. Now I know\nsome people aren't great at games, they\nmight lack the necessary hand-eye co-ordination, or they might simply not\nbe able to memorise various important\nstatistics for optimum play, but team\ngames are the best place to nurture\nthe newbies and forge them into the\ndeadly little machines you desire, bless\nthem. No, the people I hate to have on\nmy team are the ones who know nothing about teamplay, somehow believing that somebody else knows every\nstrength and weakness of their playing\nstyle and as such they demand to be\ntreated as an angry beast to be lashed\ninto a fighting state and pointed in the\ndirection of the nearest foe.\nThey are the people who have to be\nnotified when you need help, or if you\nare planning an attack on the enemy\nbase rather than looking at the situation and gauging the consequences\nthemselves. Sometimes they will take\nit upon themselves to ask \u201ccan your 6\nworkers take on that army of doom?\u201d,\nor simply asking \u201cwhat are you doing\nand what should I do?\u201d. Others might\nstart ordering players around like they\nthink they know what everyone is best\nat and exactly what works in a given\ngame. Now, I enjoy micromanagement\nin the games I play as it adds that little\nbit of extra complexity, but I don't want\nto micromanage my allies like some\nfancy bot, nor do I want somebody giving me orders that don't play to my own\nstrengths or current position. I know\nwhat works for me and unless they are\nnew to the game in question, my allies\nknow what works well for them.\nWhy can't some gamers take on the\ninitiative for themselves and actually act on their own opinion at times?\nEach member of a team increases the\noverall workload of thinking and vigi-lance, and as such each member has to\ncontribute their own share to the team.\nA decent player can babysit their own\nliving \u201cbot\u201d, but unless they are made\nof crystalline initiative, saturated with\nvigilance and reinforced by the typing\nskills of the almighty keyboard gods\nthemselves they will simply become a\nbottleneck for the team as a whole.\nThere's the common saying in books\nand films \u201cDon't try to be a hero, it will\nonly get you killed\u201d, but I beg to differ\nin games. More shy gamers should be\nheroic, arriving unannounced with all\nguns blazing for the final push of glory,\nemptying their bases to aid their allies'\nlast stand without being asked to or\neven simply trying to put out fires and\nfunctioning as a standalone by taking\nopportunities against your opponents\nand using your allies as random forces\nto react to and take advantage of. As\nfar as I'm concerned, if you can't become a hero for your team, you might\nas well become an hero.\nI've known players for years who\nare good at games and good in teams,\nplayers who are good at games but bad\nin teams, players who are bad at games\nbut good in teams, and finally players\nwho are just bad in general. And you\nknow what? If I had to choose between\nnewbies who are proactive and will\nalways try to be a thorn in their opponents side and bowl them over with\npure zeal and the n00bs who for all of\ntheir reasonable skills look to others\nfor everything except the most basic\nfunctions, I would choose the team\nplayers.\nSo here is a message to those out\nthere who look to others for leadership\nin games: I don't want to micromanage\nyou, if have to ask something based on\nthe current state of affairs, instead figure it out yourself. If I have to ask you\nto do something urgent you have already failed the first step on the road to\nteamwork, and if you respond to said\nrequest by asking questions like \u201cWhat\nwith? Where? Why?\u201d then you clearly\nhave to go back to 1v1s until you can\nkeep tabs on everything that's going on\nas the multiplayer battlefield is clearly\ntoo complicated. I am not your master,\nI am your ally, an equal to be helped\nand who helps in return, nothing more,\nnothing less.\nIf people can't keep up with the current state of affairs, then at least spare\na thought for those who are actually\nworking to support their teams while\nbanging their heads at your lack of\ndesire to actually play the game. And\nthose who don't pull the weight that\ntheir actual skills would suggest know\nwho you are, and I WILL be facepalm-ing in your direction.\nN\nE\nW\nS\nMetal Gear Solid 4 emergence \u201cPwnage\u201d copyrighted?\nAfter a period of torturous waiting and a rather befuddling trailer\nduring the Tokyo Game Show last year, Metal Gear Solid 4 finally\nemerges from a media blackout.

Ok, maybe\nnot that last part.\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFashion\nFashion Editor \u2013 Sarah Skeete\n31\nFriday 7 March 2008 felix\nWallet versus conscience\nO\nrganic and fairtrade\nfood has undergone a sharp rise in\npopularity in recent\ntimes, and fashion\nis seemingly following suit. Ethical awareness is becoming a large part of fashion marketing.\nLondon Fashion Week held a section\nfor ethical fashion initiative Estethica.\nIt provided the chance for \u2018ethicallyqualified \u2013 companies to showcase how\nmuch they\u2019ve done to keep the production and sale of their clothes morally\nsqueaky clean. So no Malaysian school\nchildren, no monkeys chained to sewing machines and no hamster-fur coats\nhere.\nThese companies are having us believe that being fairtrade and ethical is\nactually as important to them as making money. I splutter in the face if anyone that believes it. It\u2019s just a giant marketing tool and, in some cases, a very\ngood excuse for charging the gullible\nconsumer even more for their clothes\nand accessories. However, maybe I\u2019m\nbeing utterly cynical. I just find it hard\nto imagine the CEO of a major fashion\noutlet, whilst sitting in the back of his\ndiesel-imbibing Bentley, thinking what\nthe next kind of organic hemp he\u2019s going to produce his next line of handbags from. Ulterior motives or not,\nsurely it\u2019s a good thing that more and\nmore companies are becoming ethically conscious.\nBut what actually is ethical clothing?\nIt is fashion that takes into consideration the people behind the production\nand sale of the clothing, and the impacts on the environment of producing\nthese clothes. Obviously, not all clothing outlets source their stock from\nunderground Thai sweatshops, and\nin the modern world we live in, fewer\nand fewer can get away with it due to\ngrowing public concern and, hence,\nmedia scrutiny. However, Eco fashion\ndesigner Tamsin Lejeune, founder of\nthe EFF, the Ethical Fashion Forum,\nclaims there are labourers \u201cworking\nunder sweatshop conditions for less\nthan $1 a day\u201d. This type of exploitation\noccurs in some of the poorest areas of\nthe world, including Asia and South\nAmerica, where society is probably\nless concerned with ecology and ethical teatment of their workforce. Hence,\nless media coverage and investigation;\nthe general public are less taken back\nby the shock-tactic media expos\u00e9 we\nseem to be affected by.\nA company that has made their\nname based on their fairtrade labour\npractises and environmental policies is\nLos Angeles-based American Apparel.\nThe now common high street retailer\nis vertically integrated, meaning that\nthey possess total control over manu-facture, wholesale and retail duties.\nStandards and policies are procedure-wide, so regulation is tight and there\nis little ambiguity between the several\ndifferent firms that would normally be\nused in garment production. In this\nway American Apparel can guarantee\n100% ethical clothing. A sense of consumer trust has grown with American\nApparel\u2019s reputation in both the US\nand the UK. American Apparel can\nafford to charge a little more to cover\nthe costs of having fair trade standards;\ntheir LA-based factory pays an average\nof around $12 an hour, and an $8 mini-mum. This being said, American Apparel\u2019s other marketing pitch is the fact\nthat their clothes are timeless. They\nlast longer than the average sweater,\nand taken out of the cupboard 20 years\nlater, their style will still be relevant.\nI\u2019m part of their target market and in\nall honesty, the latter pitch is the one\nI relate to much more than their eco-ethical marketing when I buy from AA.\nI\u2019m guessing that the majority of people that shop at AA do so because of\nstyle rather than principles.\nA quick survey around Imperial, and\nmost agree. Responses ranged from the\nmore heavy-headed; \u201cif you want to be\nfashionable, you\u2019re not going to care,\u201d\nto the more sympathetic: \u201cthere are\nconcerns but who can afford to think\nabout it?\u201d Overall, ethical and eco\nmorals seemed to have very little bearing in their choice of clothes. Paying an\nextra few quid for the peace of mind\nthat their new top was made without detriment to anyone or anything\nseemed absurd to the average Imperial\nstudent. Most claimed knowledge of\nthe infamous Nike sweatshop scandals\nin the late 1990s, but only one person\nI spoke to said they had stopped buying their products. Many hadn\u2019t really thought about the clothes they\nbuy involving some degree of moral\nmalpractice until I questioned them\nabout it. They simply \u201cweren\u2019t aware\u201d\nand \u201cdidn\u2019t notice\u201d the issues that are\nbrought up by today\u2019s Nazi-efficient\nproduction lines. Is education the key\nto getting the average schmuck to finally turn to ethically produced cloth-ing; finally making a stand against this\n\u2018fast-fashion\u2019 culture and turning the\nhead of every director of every fashion\noutlet in the country? No. Fair trade\nand eco-friendly clothing costs more.\nPeople are more concerned about their\nown personal wealth, and not that of\nDaniel Wan discusses whether you should spend that bit extra on ethical clothes COOL\nLAME\nDespite their glum exteriors, these people are Happy. Happy, I tell you!\nWith London Fashion Week having\njust finished, it\u2019s all about Brits doing\nthings the way we always have, with an\nedginess and quirkiness seen nowhere\nelse. Capturing this perfectly are graphic print tees, such as those from Portobello boutique I Saved Laurence. Neon\nblues and pinks sit well with prints\nof sunglasses, safety pins, Godzilla\nand many others. Think Henry Holland but cuter and less self-important.\nEven American companies like Urban\nOutfitters stock entirely different collections in this country to those in the\nUS. It\u2019s all about layering, having fun\nwith accessories, and the typical Urban\nOutfitters rockstar twist.\nI know you may not believe this, but\nthe hippie look is back, only in a newer,\nsleeker way. Boho\u2019s older, more sophisticated sister, if you will. Think of the\nStella McCartney floral jumpsuit or the\nfestival look we\u2019ll all be championing\ncome June. Glastonbury is, of course,\nthe archetypal festival, with the flip\nflops and summer dresses look abandoned in favour of the more practical\nwellies. Hunter wellies are the classic\nchoice, or for a kookier look funkywel-lingtons.com have all prints and colours imaginable.\nIf vintage is your thing and the\nstealthy 70\u2019s revival currently creeping\nup on us is what you\u2019re aiming for, the\nvintage shops of Kingly Court, Carnaby\nStreet are just the ticket. There\u2019s plenty\nto choose from but one of my personal\nfavourites is Sam Greenberg. For girls,\nif you have the balls, their jumpsuits\nare bang on trend or for something\nslightly less frightening try the 70\u2019s day\ndresses, retro t-shirts and A-line skirts.\nFor the boys, vintage checked shirts,\nplimsolls and casual jackets rule. Their\nmenswear is also stocked at Topshop,\nOxford Circus.\nI should also mention the King\u2019s\nRoad\u2019s best-kept secret, Les N\u00e9r\u00e9ides.\nThis family-run French jewellery boutique has some of the most interesting,\nyet wearable jewellery I have seen, and\nthe shop always smells divine!

I\u2019ve missed yet another issue! Ah, well.\nThis term is drawing to\na close now and one wonders what words of comfort to offer everyone (and myself) as\nwe enter the lull before the storm. The\nstorm of exams of course. Yeah. I said\nit.\nSilly things, exams are. I mean, they\nserve no real purpose beyond annoying the hell outta you, really. Ah, well.\nIf the College must embark on such insipid paths, then so be it.\nEither way, this means that Felix\nGames won\u2019t be as prevalent next\nterm, sorry to say. On the other hand,\nI do urge you to look forward to issues focusing on the breadth of gaming and the likes of Metal Gear. Hopefully, those should make it up for those\nof you who like a dose of regularity to\nyour gaming section.\nThe theme this week is Randoms. It's\na somewhat hard word to ensure that\nthe articles in this issue are as unrelated as possible beyond the fact that they\nhave some to do with gaming.\nThis issue marks the debut of Jen,\nwho takes it upon herself to balance\nmy more modern slant with some\ntrips back to memory lane. For her\nfirst article, she deals with the revered\nBaldur\u2019s Gate series (in comparison, I\nonly played the PS2 action-adventure\nversions, heh). Speaking of which, Alex\nhas me trying to play Planescape: Torment and while I\u2019m not into much into\nRPGs (particularly D\u2019n\u2019D based ones),\nthe plot, world and characters sound\nso interesting I have this itching urge\nto give it a whirl. Until then, I think I\u2019ll\nsatiate my plot desires with some good\nold Terry Pratchett. Incidentally, there\nare a bunch of adventure games based\non his brilliant Discworld series and\nthose are, yet again, a bunch of titles I\nreally want to play.\nAlas... there is but little time with\nthe exams arriving, but hey, frequent\nbreaks are good during studies, right?\nSpeaking of time, it appears that we\nhave lost a gaming stalwart in the form\nof Gary Gygax. For those of you not in\nthe know (I only found about his existence recently... when I read about his\ndeath \u2013 the irony), Mr Gygax is known\nfor being one of the co-creators of the\nDungeons & Dragons gaming saga. May\nhe rest in peace.\nSpeaking of peace, Alex is spewing\nsome righteous flamebait in order to\nbreak it. This week\u2019s peeve: idiotic people in multiplayer games. The kind that\nkeep asking what they should build and\nthen ask you why. They\u2019re the same\nones who are oblivious to the amassing\nenemy hordes in front of their base and\nare usually more of a handicap than\nanything. Huzzah.\nViral Shah offers his advice with his\nreview of the SteelSeries Ikari gaming\nmice while James Porter, of Wargaming\nfame, reveals all about the boardgame\nCitadels in TableTops. Last, but not\nleast, Sebb trains Crysis players in the\nWay of the Ways.\nAnd now, I bid thee farewell till next\ntime! *ninja smoke vanish jutsu!*\nThis\nWeek\nSteelSeries Ikari mouse\nTableTops: Citadels\nPixels: Baldur\u2019s Gate Need a light?\nPixels: By Baldur\u2019s Gate!\nJen Strangeways reminisces about a portal of old where even cakes are armed\nD\nid you ever have one of\nthose moments when\nyou were talking to your\nfriends about something\nyou love, really getting\ninto it, waving your arms around mad-ly, raving about that one thing which\nyou think is just so cool, and then\nwakeingup and realise that they were\nall looking at you with a glazed expression of incomprehension? Just me? Ok,\nwell, that\u2019s how I get about the Baldur\u2019s\nGate series of games.\nThe series consists of the original\nBaldur\u2019s Gate, released in 1998, followed by the Tales of the Sword Coast\nexpansion, Baldur\u2019s Gate II: Shadows\nof Amn, and the Throne of Baal expansion for BGII.\nThe basic premise is a \u2018real time\u2019 RPG\nbased on the Dungeons and Dragons\ngaming system, but don\u2019t let that put\nyou off if you\u2019re not a tabletop gamer.\nYou create and control your own char-acter, guiding them through a beautifully complex, gripping main story arc\nwhilst also having the freedom to pursue other minor paths in and around\nthe main one. On the way, you meet\nvarious NPCs of whom you can choose\nup to five of to join your party and control as you do your own character.\nThe real beauty of this series, and the\nthing which makes it so timeless, is the\ntotal customisability of its gameplay. If\nyou\u2019re a diehard D&D player you can\nturn on all the options to make it seem\na lot more turn-based and true to the\noriginal system.\nExamples: you can choose to view\ndice rolls as characters make attacks,\nhave the game auto-pause after each\nturn, etc. Alternatively, if you like a\nmore fast-paced, realistic game, you\ncan switch everything off, give all your\ncharacters AI scripts, and watch them\ndo your unholy bidding\u2026 I mean, take\ncare of things themselves.\nFrom a roleplaying perspective, the\ninteractions your character has with\nother characters in the game are controlled by you picking your character\u2019s\nresponses from a list. The exact thing\nyou want to say may not appear, but\nyou have the opportunity to be as good\nor as evil as you like. Of course, if you\nplay evil and run around murdering\npeople, there are consequences... This\nis taken further in BGII, where characters in your party will converse both\nwith you and with each other, form relationships (which you have the chance\nto screw up royally \u2013 realism!), and\nleave your party if they disagree with\nthe life choices you\u2019re making. The\nactual gameplay is comprised mainly\nof running around completing minor\nquests \u2013 solving some actually challenging puzzles, usually being betrayed\nby the people who asked for your help,\nand generally destroying anything\nwhich gets in your way.\nVisually, BGII is stunning even now.\nAlthough going back to BGI can be a\nlittle irritating after playing with the\nfar superior graphics and resolution of\nBGII, this is actually solvable via a neat\nlittle free mod available online which\nsimply shifts all the BGI game content\ninto the BGII version of the excellent\nInfinity engine. You view the characters from above, which is nice if you\nfeel like playing God, and the controls\nare similar to many real time strategy\ngames. The required specs are laugh-able, BG will run on your PC (Mac versions are also available). It seems complicated at first glance due to the sheer\namount of control you can exert over\nevents, but it\u2019s actually really intuitive.\nAnd very, very, pretty. I can\u2019t describe\nit. Go buy the game. It\u2019s under a ten-ner for the whole series on Amazon.\nThere\u2019s no excuse.\nAnyone getting a Star Wars vibe from the lower left bit?\n\n"

    "content": "14 felix Friday 7 March 2008\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics\nThe facts about the Lisbon Treaty\nNo straight bananas here, only a balanced and fair analysis on the Lisbon Treaty and how it affects you\nDebate has been raging in the House of\nCommons this week concerning a possible referendum for the EU\u2019s Lisbon\nTreaty, the successor to the EU Constitution. This culminated on Tuesday\nwith Liberal Democrat foreign affairs\nspokesman Edward Davey being ordered out of the House of Commons.\nMr. Davey was angered at the deputy\nspeaker\u2019s decision not to allow a debate\non their idea for a referendum on EU\nmembership, claiming he was \u201cgagged\u201d.\nOther MPs walked out in solidar-ity, showing disregard for the deputy\nspeaker and his \u201coutrageous\u201d decision.\nHaving a referendum on the EU\nTreaty in theory gives the people the\nopportunity to decide for themselves\nwhether to sign up. However, a referendum requires the electorate to\nunderstand the issue and with one as\ncomplex and divisive as this, is it wise\nto allow the general public to decide? If\nthere is to be a referendum, the people\nneed to know what effects the Treaty\nwill have on their lives and the sovereignty of the country. The following\nquestions will hopefully give you an\ninsight into the issues involved in the\nratification of the Lisbon Treaty.\nWhat role will the EU President\nhave?\nThe Treaty will change the role of the\nPresident of the Council of the European Union, only one of many presidential posts. This Council is comprised\nof all member states of the EU. The\npresidency will not be held by a member state as has been the case up till\nnow; instead a single person will hold\nthe position. The President will be a\ntop politician, elected by prime ministers and national presidents, the top\nrepresentatives of each member state\nin the Council of the European Union.\nThe new president will be in power for\na term of 30 months, increased from 6.\nThe President will not have any executive powers and there will continue to\nbe separate presidents of the European\nCommission and European Parliament. The Treaty does not rule out the\nmerging of any of these positions but\nit does not instigate it. Three countries\nwill run councils to discuss legislation\nin areas such as employment, the envi-ronment, communications and trans-port. This maintains the old system\nof state presidencies but in a power-sharing arrangement. The introduc-James Goldsack\ntion of one figure as the President does\nnot change how the EU and member\nstates deal with signing international\ntreaties.\nWill there be an EU foreign minister who will overrule national\nfigures?\nNot as such. The Treaty creates a new\nposition of High Representative of the\nUnion for Foreign Affairs and Security\nPolicy which in practice is an amalgamation of two current positions:\nforeign policy and security chief, currently Javier Solana, and External Relations Commissioner, Benita FerreroWaldner. The new position will have\nthe diplomatic power of the former\nand the financial capabilities of the\nlatter position. The new High Representative will be a powerful position\nand have lots of staff working for the\noffice. As this person will be speaking on behalf of all 27 member states,\nthey will probably be more important\ninternationally than any individual\nnational foreign secretary. However,\nJavier Solana already has a louder voice\nthan most member states. The High\nRepresentative will only be able to implement policy agreed unanimously by\nthe member states so they could often\nbe left without any input into proceed-ings. A declaration, a statement of political intent, has been inserted into the\nTreaty saying the creation of the high\nrepresentative does not \u201caffect the responsibilities of the member states...\nfor the formulation and conduct of\ntheir foreign policy\u201d. Although not legally binding, declarations are taken\ninto account in the European Court of\nJustice.\nWhat position will the EU have in\nthe UN?\nThe Treaty increases the ability to have\na common foreign policy and although\nsome countries would like to see the\nEU have a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, the UN\ncharter specifies that the seats are for\n\u201cstates\u201d only. Therefore the EU, being\nan international organisation, cannot join. Some claim it is only a matter of time before France and the UK\nlose the seats to be replaced by the EU\nbut if this is to occur it will be so far\ndown the line that the details cannot\nbe predicted; for the time being there\nis no indication at all that the EU can\nor will join the UN. The Treaty does\nsay that when all member states adopt\na common foreign policy, those countries on the Security Council will ask\nfor the High Representative to present\nthe EU position. This would only occur if there was unanimous agreement within the EU. Javier Solana has\nalready presented the EU position on\nmany occasions. This does not prevent\nthe member states individually making\ntheir own statements. A declaration in\nthe Treaty states that the EU\u2019s common\nforeign and security policy will not affect a member state\u2019s membership of\nthe UN Security Council.\nDoes it give national governments a bigger say?\nYes. There are procedures in the Treaty\nwhich require national governments\nto be notified of proposed legislation.\nThe governments can then challenge\nthe introduction of this legislation.\nHowever, the EU can overrule national\ngovernments but the introduction of a\nforum for dissent is an improvement\nover previous treaties. The treaty attempts to encourage national governments to involve themselves with European legislation and governance; one\nclause specifies \u201c\u201cNational parliaments\nWith the possiblity of an EU President post being created, will we see Tony Blair in a new position?\nLiberal Democrat MP Ed Davey speaks to his constituents after being thrown out of Parliament\n\n"

No other\ncity in the world can lay\nclaim to its pedigree and\nheritage for all things sartorial \u2013 this is the city, after all, that\nsaw Paul Poiret liberate women from\nthe suffocating restraints of the corset,\nChristian Dior usher in the New Look\nand Coco Chanel revolutionise women\u2019s dress. The city\u2019s governing body\nfor fashion, the Chambre Syndicale,\nchooses very carefully not only whom\nit allows to show for the prestigious\nand biannual couture shows, but also\nits ready-to-wear shows. If London is\na creative hotbed of eccentricity, New\nYork is sleek city chic and Milan the\nhome of unabashed glamour, then\nParis is the place where the future of\nfashion takes shape.\nA glance at the list of shows reveals a\ndepth of talent that even Milan would\nlie, cheat and steal to obtain, and it is\nno coincidence that Paris is the last city\non the schedule \u2013 any other city or series of shows would be swept away in\nits wake. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me is here\n\u2013 and you\u2019d better be on your toes.\nBalenciaga\nEvery season, the industry\u2019s elite make\ntheir way to the Balenciaga show early\nin the morning for fashion\u2019s equivalent of what critic and fashion historian Colin MacDowell once described\nas \u201cthe scrubbing of the chapel steps\u201d.\nThis small but roaring house means\nbusiness, and is back in a big way after\ncreative director Nicholas Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s\nrecent tour de force collections. The\nlast couple of shows, though eventually influential, had been met with a\ntwinge of disappointment. But for fall,\nGhesqui\u00e8re pulled out all the stops.\nJackets that had been moulded,\nsliced and sculpted to form the body-defining pieces that Balenciaga himself\nfavoured were redefined in shiny, slick\nplastics and latex that fused classics\nfrom the archives with Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s\nown sci-fi tastes (who could forget\nthe manic robo-leggings from spring\n2007\u2019s show?). The powerful glare of\nstudio spotlights was transformed into\nbenign, mesmerising shapes by meticulously cut black satin in one piece\nwhile skinny cigarette trousers in muted shades of grey balanced the rich,\ncreamy contrast of colour in gorgeously\ndraped velvet and taffeta tops. But this\nwas a more mature iteration of his previous collections \u2013 powerful enough to\nsteer the choppy course of fashion, but\nwearable enough to be snapped up for\nmore than sheer collectibility.\nChanel\nSome designs are so iconic and classic\nthat they barely need to be altered. The\nPorsche 911 and Fender Strat are two\nsuch designs. The Chanel tweed jacket\nand skirt combination is another. Karl\nLagerfeld provided an effortless meditation on current trends recast in a\nwhitewashed space, complete with\ncarousel and a viewing platform that\nmodels returned to once completing\ntheir short route for further viewing.\nBeautiful trailing coats and peplum\njackets hit the sweet spot while full-length separates were considered in a\nlooser fashion than Marios Schwab\u2019s\nearlier body-conscious incarnation.\nLagerfeld focused heavily on unforced,\neasy interpretations of Chanel classics\nlaid out with heavy fabrics artfully torn\nand roughly hewn \u2013 a certain celluloid\nmale model would approve, no doubt.\nA high-gloss, shiny, wet-look cocktail\ndress retained the archetypal silhouette\nwhile matron-like Nazca print jackets\nadded interest later in the collection to\nlight separates. In an interesting turn,\nLagerfeld also sent out a few looks for\nthe gentleman seeking fashion enlight-enment, Chanel-style \u2013 appreciated if\nonly because Chanel menswear is as\nrare as chicken\u2019s teeth. The show felt\nmore like a token nod to trends than\na hard-hitting, season-defining collection \u2013 but for a house with such a\ntimeless aesthetic, it hardly matters\nwhen much of the defining is already\nin the past.\nYves Saint Laurent\nYSL\u2019s fall show felt like an Ultraviolet\nspinoff colliding headfirst with Asimov\u2019s I, Robot (or should that be I,\nFembot?). Models filed out sinisterly\nidentical in short, abbreviated bobs\nand slit black sunglasses. Like Karl\nLagerfeld, head designer Stefano Pilati\u2019s collection was essentially a fresh\ntake on YSL classics executed with a\nsingular vision and unerring verve. In\nthis case, a slick, updated futureshock\nvision of precision cut, techno-organ-ic and super-slick looks that quietly\nflaunted their (admittedly impressive)\ncredentials. Asymmetrically cut day-dresses with casually loose shoulders\npreceded high waisted, wide-legged\ntrousers that presented a louche take\non classic YSL. Even the simplest staples were reinterpretated with a self-assured aplomb, like a breathtaking\nwhite shirt with dramatically-sculpted\nsleeves, belted above a rising black velvet skirt with gold bordering. Or how\nabout a subtly funnelled brown velvet\nsports jacket with gold hardware?\nPilati played tactically with colour,\nshowing sparing glimpses of cerulean\nand pale yellow in amongst a sea of\npredominantly black and brown. Standouts included a simple belted white\ndress with flecks of black that turned\nout to be feathers, and a sheer flowing\nwhite shirt paired with gloriously loose\ntrousers embellished with a constellation of sequins. At 39 in total, the\ncollection was appropriately succinct,\nconsidering the Homeric timescales\nof other similarly large houses. And as\nYSL owners Gucci (PPQ) will be glad\nto note, Pilati\u2019s rising profile amongst\nthe Paris elite will only be good for\nsales. After years of inconsistency and\na couple of lukewarm receptions, most\npeople suspect they won\u2019t be the only\nones.\nLanvin\nAfter some severe deliberation, I concluded that it was impossible not to\nlove Lanvin. Creative director Alber Elbaz\u2019s designs appeal to the hyperfemi-nine traditionalists with their classic\nsilhouettes and air of refinement, and\nthey appeal to the buyers and women\nwho want extra panache with their\nworking look. Not least, they appeal\nto the critics who laud Elbaz\u2019s highly\npersonalised, bold and innovative collections that have been as consistent\nas their similarly rising sales figures. A\nbeautifully proportioned pencil skirt\nconstructed of ribbon and layered in\nruffles was paired to a dark gunmetal\nsilk blouse while the same pleatlike details reappeared on a gorgeous black\ncocktail dress. There were svelte, darkly sexy one-shouldered dresses in satin\nParis Fashion Week, Fall \u201808 RTW\nA report on the last major Autumn/Winter 2008 catwalk shows, dans le joli Paris by David J Paw\n(Left to right) Chanel; Balenciaga; Lanvin; Junya Watanabe; Chanel\n\n"

As we all know, Felix is an unpredictable beast over the\nSummer months, and so this could\nbe one of the last times you see Angry Geek this year. Nevertheless, I\u2019m\nhappy to go out with a bang. Thanks to\neveryone who contributed this week;\nwell done to Mrs. McLovin\u2019 for taking\nthe prize; and a big thanks to everyone\nwho asked Tomo who I am. Keep asking him. He loves it, especially when\nyou phone him late at night.\nWe may speak again before Summer,\nbut if not \u2013 I shall see you in the warm\ndarkness of Autumn, bitter and cynical as I should be. Enjoy the Summer,\nfolks.\nT\no coin a phrase: SEX!\nNow that I have your\nattention\u2026\nA. Geek is absolutely\nright. Students are rarely\nthinking about the refurbishment of\nthe union, the allocation of budgets to\nclubs and societies, or probably even\nthe lecture they\u2019re now undoubtedly\nsitting in. I\u2019d estimate I spend about\n45% of my thought time \u2013 travelling,\nfalling asleep, showering etc. \u2013 thinking about sex. That figure rises to about\n80% during lectures. And I\u2019m one of\nthe statistical minority of women at IC.\nCan you imagine what all those poor\nsex-starved men are going through on\na daily basis? All too well, I\u2019m afraid.\nHowever, I have to say that lately a\nbare majority of that sexual thought\ntime has been becoming increasingly\nboring, at least from an entertainment\npoint of view. A couple of things keep\ncoming up which are steadily seeming\nmore and more bizarre to me.\nThe first issue on my mind is sexual-ity. During the recent election havoc,\nyou may or may not have noticed that one of the candidates is the former president\nof I.Q (the imperial LGBT\nsociety). This sparked a few\nconversations amongst some\nof the people I\u2019ve spoken\nto which, frankly,\nshockedthehell\nout of me.\nI am openly\nand comfortably\nbisexual. Not, \u201cI\u2019ve\nkissed a few girls when\ndrunk\u201d bisexual, or \u201cI\u2019m an\nemo kid who wants to be\nspecial\u201d bisexual, but really,\ngenuinely, 50/50 bi. Most of\nthe people I know know that\nand are fine with it, yet some of\nthetiradeswhichhavecomefromthose\nsame people could only be described\nas intolerant. It\u2019s ok to be friends with\na weirdo, but you don\u2019t want them in\npower. Often women who discover my\nsexuality for the first time shy away\nfrom me. I\u2019ve said it before, and will\ndoubtless repeat myself ad nauseum\nfor the rest of my life: think about your\npreferred gender. Do you find yourself\nattracted to every (hah) member of\nthat gender? No? So what makes you\nthink just because I like girls means I\nlike you?\nBy and large men are ok with my\nsexuality, although I find it irritating\nthat a small minority seem to equate\nbisexuality in women with \u201cactually\nbeing straight, but just a little bit easy\u201d.\nAnd obviously, there are people who\nmake the assumptions given above, but\nfor the most part, being bi as a girl is\npretty easy. On the other hand, I have\ngay/lesbian and a couple of transsexual\nfriends who really suffer; not from\nopen bigotry and hatred, but from the\nsocial awkwardness and mild disgust\ndisplayed by others on finding out. (In-cidentally, transgenderism of all types\nis not a mental disease which can be\n\u201ccured\u201d any more than any other alternative sexuality is). The thought\nthat these prejudices exist at Imperial\nwas astounding to me. In a community\nfull of in- telligent, reasonable people who\nI have never seen\ndiscriminate based\non race, religion,\nstyle of clothing, culture or anything else\napart from possibly\nchoice of course (if\nyou do chemistry, bi-ology, or materials:\nHAHAHAHA,\nCompSci: You\u2019re\nnot read- ing this, you never\ncame into college today, Medicine: You\nknow what we think.), there are still\npeople who are scared of the thought\nthat someone undesirable to them\nmight potentially \u201clike\u201d them.\nAdmittedly, this is partly down to the\nattitude of a small number of LGBT\npeople. If you\u2019re going to give a huge\nreaction when provoked, get used to\nthe fact there are people out there who\nwill go out of their way to provoke you,\nbut honestly? I think that a lot of this\nsimply comes down to the fact that sex\nremains a ridiculously taboo subject.\nOn SHAG week people were actively\nhiding their faces and scuttling by the\nSherfield Walkway, embarrassed at the\nthought of being given a free chlamydia\ntest kit and condoms. My first thought?\nFucking brilliant! Condoms are ridiculously expensive, and although they are\navailable from the doctors, how many\npeople are both aware of that and unashamed enough about sex to ask? And\nif \u2013 whisper it \u2013 sex is a big, embar-rassing, secret thing for you, then is it\nany surprise you know little enough\nabout it to be worried by someone who\nmaybe doesn\u2019t go about it the same\nway you do?\nAnd worse, if you don\u2019t know and\ndon\u2019t feel you can talk about the social,\nemotional, and psychological aspects\nof sex, it can really damage you and you\ncan damage other people without real-ising. You\u2019re bright, I know you know\nthe mechanics and all the nasty stuff\nyou see on TV about people not wearing t-shirts embroidered with their\nSTD of choice (although I\u2019d buy one for\njokes). If you don\u2019t have the message\nby now to use a condom or get tested,\nwell, it\u2019s your body. But if everyone is\noblivious to the idea that one night\nstands can boost your confidence for\none night, then crush your ego in the\nmorning, or that calling someone \u201cfaggot\u201d (or, indeed, \u201cbreeder\u201d) can really\ncut deeper than other types of insult,\nor that just because you can separate\nemotion from physicality doesn\u2019t mean\nsomeone else can, then it creates a culture of everything negative you\u2019ve ever\nassociated with sex.\nLet me state it clearly for you: Sex is\nnothing to be ashamed of, and essential to be informed about. How, where\nand with whom you do it is a big deal,\nbecause you have to live with it, but\nhaving in the first place, or not if you\ndon\u2019t choose to, is not a big deal at all.\nTalk about it. Ask about it. If you don\u2019t\nunderstand someone\u2019s point of view on\nthe subject, listen to them explain it.\nAnd if you still don\u2019t understand, well,\nit\u2019s just sex. Their opinion differing on\nthat one subject shouldn\u2019t mean you\nfeel awkward around them, any more\nthan you\u2019d feel awkward around someone with different colour skin. You\ncame to IC in pursuit of knowledge\nand parties \u2013 can you think of a better\nway to mix the two?\nA winner\nis you!\nMrs McLovin\nBi the way\n\u201c\nI find it\nirritating that a\nsmall minority\nseem to equate\nbisexuality in\nwomen with\n\u201cactually being\nstraight, but\njust a little bit\neasy\u201d\nThey\u2019re only condoms, kids, they won\u2019t bite\n\n"

    "content": "36 felix Friday 7 March 2008\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames\nAnother Take\n\u201cWell, I might add that \u2013 compared to my old Logitech \u2013 I\nwasn\u2019t blown away by the high\nCPI (I play with low sensitivity).\nLight, smooth-glide and the\ncomfort key are appreciable\nhowever.\u201d\nDerek Chow\nM\nice,\nthey're probably\none of the most overlooked aspects of a\ncomputer. The average user will perhaps understand the\nneed for more GHz or a larger hard-drive but it will never occur to them to\nquestion the rodent which falls out of\nthe computer box. Now for the most\npart your standard mouse is sufficient\nto meet the demands of the majority\nof people so this isn't such a problem.\nBut if you are a gamer (and if you are\nreading this I assume you are) things\nare very different. A decent mouse can\nmean the difference between life and\ndeath, or so I've been repeatedly told.\nYou see until recently I was that average user, fragging away with my good\nold Microsoft Intellimouse, which I\nthought was perfectly adequate.\nIt was only a few weeks ago\nwhen I finally took the\nplunge and purchased a\nSteel Series Ikari optical\nmouse to see whether\nit made any difference to my gaming aptitude.\nYou may be\nwondering \"why\nnot go for a laser mouse\ninstead of\nan opti-cal?\". Steel\nSeries actually recommends the\noptical version\nof the Ikari, rather\nthan the laser, for FPS gaming as it can cope with extremely fast\nmouse movement slightly better. They\nrecommend the laser for MMO/RTS\ngamers who use the mouse with a high\nsensitivity setting but still require a\nhigh degree of accuracy. In actual fact,\nthe overwhelming reason for getting\na laser mouse, and indeed the main\nreason why they were invented, is because they are much better at tracking\non shiny surfaces that normal optical\nmice can't cope with. Suffice to say, if\nyou use a proper mouse mat, either a\nlaser or standard optical mouse will\nserve you fine.\nTo test the Ikari I got stuck into some\nTeam Fortress 2 . This has been a game\nof choice for me recently so I thought it\nwould be the perfect game to test some\nquick-paced, high sensitivity, run,\njump, shoot, repeat gaming along with\nthe occasional slower sniping.\nTheIkari'sdesignimmediatelystands\nout from the instant you first wield the\ndevice. The first thing that struck me\nis that this mouse is huge; its definitely\nnot for people with small hands. Once\nI got used to the size, however, I found\nit very comfortable and a pleasure to\nuse. Steel Series called in a number\nof professional gaming teams, including SK gaming, to co-design the device and subsequently the mouse has\na very finely tuned design. It doesn't\nhave many of the superfluous features\nof other gaming mice such as weights\nor glowing scroll wheels like you get\non Razors, so you're left with just an\nexcellent mouse. By far the mouse's\nbest feature has to be the DPI switching button: storing, in the mouse itself,\ntwo different sensitivities that can be\npreset! The user can switch between\nhigh and low sensitivity with just a single click of a button (albeit with a 3 second delay); enabling him/her to use it\nfor different applications. Try using a\nRazor's high sensitivity for photoshop\nand you'll be battling to keep the cursor tame.\nGaming with this mouse was a lot\nof fun; the glide is smooth as silk and\nthe accurate CPI (counts per inch)\nfor those \u201cHeadshots\u201d had my friends\ncursing me within minutes of starting a TF2 game. They say the gear\ndoesn't make the gamer but this mouse\nsure does help if you use it right (see\nbelow).\nBy this point, you're probably aware\nThe SteelSeries Ikari: razor sharp?\nI really like this mouse. However, if\nyou need it spelling out for you, this is\nthe best gaming mouse I've ever used!\nThere is no comparison with any non-gaming mouse and beats the Razors\nthat my friends own hands down in\nterms ergonomics and ease of use. So if\nyou are one those people gaming with\nthat old default mouse or just someone\nwho feels like an upgrade I cannot recommend this highly enough.\nHow to get the most out of your\ngaming mouse:\n\u2022 If you normally use a regular mouse\nwith inferior CPI, you'll probably notice how zippy your gaming mouse\nmight appear \u2013 this is not the idea, readjust the sensitivity lower so that it\nfeels comfortable again. You want to\nbe using the extra counts per\ninchfor\naccura-cy, not\ndecreasng\nthe number\nof inches you\nhave to move.\n\u2022 Turn off\n\u2018mouse acceleration\u2019 for games;\nwith this kind of\nsetting on, faster\nmovement increases\nwith distance moved\nand this will undermine\nthe accuracy of your\nmouse as well as degenerating your reaction/physi-cal speed).\nViral Shah unsheaths the coveted SteelSeries Ikari and wields it in the name of the PC Alliance\n\u2022 Turn off \u2018mouse smooth\u2019; perhaps preferential (Steel Series have\nit as an option in their software), but\nI feel it dumbs down your mouse's\nhigh sensitivity by rounding off your\nmovements.\nter. To follow The Way of Jean Claude\nVan Damme, you too must kill without\nremorse, engaging each enemy in brutal melee. Try tossing still-flailing opponents at groups of enemies \u2013 instant\nsatisfaction guaranteed! Now get out\nthere and kick some ass.\nThe Way of the Anaesthesiologist\nMaybe you haven't noticed that Crysis\nhas a tactical attachment that fires stun\ndarts. Well, it does, and it is the only\nweapon of choice for the anaesthesi-ologist (I should have chosen a shorter\nname for this one...).\nDispatch your enemies, but only for\nperiods of a minute at a time, when\nthey will awake groggily to find you\nhave already passed. Carrying both\nthe SCAR and the AK is highly recom-mended, allowing you to shoot opiates\nfaster than Heath Ledger (was that too\nsoon?).\nEmbark on the Path of the Crysis\nSebastian Nordgren completes his training and returns with words of wisdom and warning\nI\nliked Crysis, but I never thought\nthe aliens (yes, there are aliens,\nif that was a spoiler you really\nneed to get up to date) were\ntoo swanky and I didn't like\nthat there were no ways around them\nother than by destroying them. I did,\nhowever, love the first half or so of the\ngame, when your only enemies are Koreans who, uncharacteristically for enemy AI, can't see you through bushes,\ntrees, rocks or mountains. This led me\nto experiment with a variety of different ways of playing this section, par-ticularily on the first level. Here are\nsome challenges for those who thought\nthe vanilla Crysis experience wasn't\nenough.\nThe Way of the Ninja\nYou may think that ninjas don't exist anymore. You are mistaken. For\nproof, look behind you. Whoops, too\nslow! Ninjas are stealthy assassins, and\nso must you be to follow The Way of\nthe Ninja. Except minus the assassin\npart, because you're not supposed to\nkill anyone. You're also not supposed\nto be spotted by anyone (because if\nyou were, that wouldn't be very ninja,\nwould it?). Use your nanosuit stealth to\nyour advantage and duck from cover\nto cover, always in the shadows, always\nmere feet away from your unsuspecting enemies. Enemies whom you shall\nleave alone, not out of mercy, no, but\nbecause your Way is one of enlightenment and patience. Venture forth and\nbe like the shadows!\nThe Way of Jean-Claude van\nDamme\nVan Damme, being the greatest action\nhero ever (ever), takes no prisoners.\nHe also has no use for firearms of any\nsort, dispatching his enemies by swiftly\nbreaking their limbs \u2013 if that limb happens to be their neck, so much the bet-The Way of Sam Fisher\nSam Fisher is a stealthy assassin of\nSplinter Cell fame, but unlike the ninja\nwhose powers of stealth extend into\nthe supernatural, Sam is a mere mortal\nwho still wishes to remain undetected.\nTo this end, he only ever dispatches\nenemies using his trusty silenced side-arm, and so must you too to follow The\nWay of Sam Fisher. Acquire two such\npistols, creep from the shadows and\ndeliver a classic 2-1 tap: 2 in the chest,\n1 in the head. Now you too can get\ndouble-crossed by the US government\nand thrown in an African prison, left\nto plot your revenge on your former\nmasters!\nThe Way of Tommy the Turtle\nAfter jumping out of your plane, you\nland in the water just off a small beach.\nOn this beach is a turtle, Tommy. He\nis your new best friend, in fact, he is\nyour only friend. Tommy doesn't care if\nyou kill, maim or dismember your en-emies, but insists on coming with you\nwherever you go. Unfortunately for\nyou (and Tommy), Tommy can't walk\nvery quickly, so it falls to you to carry\nhim with you wherever you go. And\nshould Tommy die from a stray bullet,\nyou should terminate the guilty with\nextreme prejudice, then take his lifeless\ncorpse with you as a testament to the\nbravery of the only creature who ever\ntruly understood you. Bury him on a\nmountain overlooking the island that\nhe knew as home \u2013 a place now fraught\nwith your anguish for failing Tommy.\nThrow yourself off that same moun-tain, for life can never be the same.\nNow, go out into the world of Crysis and experiment \u2013 perhaps you too\nshall discover another Way, in which\ncase we'd be very happy to hear about.\nPerhaps the Way of the Bunny beck-ons? Or the Way of the Snake? But I\nwill not slow down your progress into\nthe self-discovery inherent in the Ways\nby telling you too much too soon. Venture out and find for thyself.\nHe\u2019s so good, we can\u2019t see him\nAww, look at him sleep... noob\n\n"

In contrast to other highly conspicuous and highly touted designers,\nElbaz\u2019s designs never overpower the\nwearer and always allow her \u2013 and not\nthe clothes \u2013 to be the focus of atten-tion, rather than setting up a vapid and\nfrankly neurotic \u201cfashion safari\u201d of key\npieces from famous designers. Thankfully, in amongst the seething mass\nof trends inundating editors and the\npublic, Elbaz remembered the small\noversight that clothes can and should\nbe gorgeous. And the fashion world is\na better place for it.\nJunya Watanabe\nOne of the quieter personalities of Paris\nFashion Week, Watanabe described his\nfall collection in two words: \u201cgeometric\nsculpture\u201d. Sometimes less is more, and\nWatanabe understands this perfectly.\nWith a collection that would give New\nYork drape artist Doo Ri Chung a run\nfor her money, he presented a panorama of shape and form that was true\ntoitsdescriptivenamesake.Geometric,\nprecisely-draped tops fell effortlessly\nacross languorous split skirts dramatically folded into thick bands or left\nloose, and fluid draped jersey dresses\nformed an interesting visual continuity\nwith sharp, tucked and folded jersey\ntops with layers rolling down the back\nin a beautifully executed exploration of\nline, layer and volume. Every piece was\na puzzle of shapes and lines that one\ncould happily lose oneself in.\nTailoring was also represented by\nprecision-cut jackets with dramatic\ncreases and soft folds rippling invitingly across the fabric, or familiar\nshapes with odd details such as the replacement of conventional sleeves with\ncape-like openings. The models were\nalmost as mesmerising as the clothes\nthemselves, faces shrouded in black\ncloth with headpieces resembling said\nsculptures \u2013 the designer\u2019s play on\nwords could refer to the obvious statement of the models, or the referral to\nthe clothes themselves visually representing an aesthetic more conventionally associated with the world of art.\nA painstakingly twisted, teased and\ncontorted full-length top was a complex riot of shapes and proportions like\nsomething from the dark landscape of\na Guillermo del Toro film. The world\nof fashion is changing, and with the\nencroachment of embarrassing celebrity capsule collections (read: cash\ncows) for high street chains and the\namateurish efforts of would-be society\ndesigners, it is reassuring to watch the\nunearthly glare of near-genius wafting\nunmistakeably by. Stunning.\nAlexander McQueen\nThey say that beauty is a commodity\n\u2013 if you don\u2019t appreciate it, someone\nelse will. Some may lament the fact\nthat women will lie, cheat and steal for\nan Alexander McQueen gown but for\nthe fashion faithful, this is a perverse\ncause for celebration rather than consternation \u2013 it is reassuring that things\nso beautiful can exist in the world. It\nmakes the world a more wondrous,\nfuzzy place to be, and though the view\nis undeniably rose-tinted, those inclined more towards the aesthetically\nindulgent escapist reveries of fashion\nwere not the most realistic group of\nfolk to begin with \u2013 think of them as\nlost causes.\nNot that they could care less. When\nAlexander McQueen revealed this collection on Friday, the fashion world\nwas turned upside down and the planets realigned themselves around earth\nand more specifically, around McQueen himself. Variously described\nas arguably his most confident collection and the most stunning since fall\n06\u2019s memorable collection (massive,\nsweeping Edwardian gowns and birds),\nfashion\u2019s great romanticist produced\nan incredible collection of dark fairytale princesses and sweeping colonial\ngrandeur in a dark bloom of blacks\nand an explosion of deep Indian reds.\nLight, feminine ballet-length dresses\nwith ruffled hems or embroidered details were mated with teased, frizzed\nhair or enigmatic shawls that recalled\nall the eccentricity and charm of a fairytale dream.\nExaggerated silhouettes in matte\nblack and tartan expanded into capacious and bunched-up dresses, and\ntartan and heavy monochrome prints\nmanifested themselves in pieces with\nfrothy, ruffled collars and jacket bor-ders. Snowflakes embroidered onto\none black chiffon dress spilled over the\nhem and burst forth in a wonderfully\nfrivolous display, and splendid headdresses adorned the final half of the\ncollection, which ushered in a fitfully\nregal display of pomp embellished with\na newfound softness. The jewellery was\nopulent and the details indulgent, and\nit was obvious no expense had been\nspared in what was an over-the-edge\nand most assured experience. Where\nothers had failed, he has conquered\n\u2013 McQueen\u2019s risky no-compromise\napproach has paid dividends (his company has just gone into profit). What a\nway to celebrate.\nSonia Rykiel\nThe longstanding \u201cqueen of knits\u201d,\nRykiel isn\u2019t the first person you think\nof when someone mentions joie de\nvivre. But after last season\u2019s spirited\nfinale when the models ran out at the\nend laughing and giggling as if \u2013 God\nforbid \u2013 they were real people, Rykiel\nseems to be working the goodwill like\nno one else. In a bizarre show that\nbrought a smile to every face in the\ncrowd, Rykiel showed an ageless series\nof looks that would have had women of\nall ages grinning with delight. Though\nthere was an abundance of colour-fully splashed knits and minidresses in\nshades of ice cream flavours, the season\u2019s focus on austere was referenced\nin black tailoring that was still offset by\nzanily coloured tights and coats. Rykiel\nworked her own brand of fun that was\nneither too urbane (Anna Sui), nor\nkooky (Marni).\nAnother dominant theme was the\ntrapeze silhouette, worked into sweater dresses and oversized coats, eventually progressing to billowing full-length\nevening gowns with zesty art prints.\nBut though the clothes were undeniably gorgeous (and will sell by the shed-load), the focus was all on the models.\nBowler hats and dippy black-rimmed\nspectacles added to the cartoonish exaggeration brought about by the beams\non their faces \u2013 it\u2019s not every day you\nsee Russian superwaif Vlada Roslyakova beaming like she fell off the set of\nBring It On. And was that the first high\nfive ever seen on a runway? Who cares.\nHere\u2019s to next season!\nMaison Martin Margiela\nThere is always an understated excitement crackling restlessly in the air\nbefore a Margiela show. A talismanic\nforce in fashion, the fashion sorority\nalways sternly considers the designer\u2019s commentaries on trends future\nand present. Heavy rock coursed over\nthe hall\u2019s sound system as spotlights\nglanced up and down irascibly before\nthe show. And then the first looks\ncame out. More critique than marketing business tool, Margiela\u2019s show\nfocused on those difficult trends that,\nthough they are hot as of now, it\u2019s almost laughably funny that they came\nalong at the same time.\nFunnel necks were explored on motorcycle jackets, print blouses and\nsweater dresses, resembling gargantuan donuts or less savoury restroom\ncontraptions \u2013 you almost felt bad for\nthe models wearing them. And the\npadded shoulders. Oh, the shoulders.\nRaised, pinched and suspended until\nthey resembled the Hong Kong skyline\nor a vigilante\u2019s cape, they grew, curved,\ncontorted and joined until they had\ncome full circle and mutated back into\nthe funnel neck, as gloriously experimental and over-the-top as only Margiela can do. This didn\u2019t stop countless\neditors, enthusiasts and bloggers pondering their meaning, however. But\ngive him more credit than that \u2013 not\neverything he shows has to be deliberated upon like an oracle\u2019s enigmatic\nmessage. The show was anarchic, bold\nand sexy \u2013 and like everyone else, we\u2019ll\nbe waiting to see the store collections.\n(Left to right) Junya Watanabe;\nAlexander McQueen; Lanvin\n(Left to right) YSL; Lanvin; Maison Martin Margiela\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 7 March 2008 felix\nPolitics\nDry Wit & Tonic\nPower-sharing talks in Kenya stall\nKofi Annan announces that talks in Kenya, aimed at reconciling ethnic groups, have been suspended\nKatya-yani Vyas\nOn Tuesday the 26th of February, talks\ntargeted at ending violence in Kenya\nbroke down after the bitter rivals in\nthe dispute as to who was the victor in\nthe December elections failed to come\nto an agreement on a power sharing\ndeal. Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been leading the\nnegotiations and has announced that\nthe talks have been suspended, a move\nthat will prompt fears of renewed vio-lence. In a diplomatic move to try and\ncompromise, Annan announced that\nhe would communicate with the leaders directly to try and reinvigorate negotiations which have been staggering\nalong for weeks without any success. \u201cI\nhope these people will understand this\nis a move intended to speed up action,\u201d\nAnnan said of his decision. It is unclear\nwhether they will; Kenyan politics and\npublic opinion are extremely volatile.\nThe problems centre around the two\nopposing party leaders, Kibaki, the\npresident, and Odinga, the opposition\nparty leader. The Former has been\naccused by his rival of stealing the\nelection, while the president blames\nOdinga for instigating the ethnic violence that has left over 1,000 people\ndead and forced 300,000 people to flee\ntheir homes after rival gangs, organised largely on ethnic lines, went on\nthe rampage. Negotiators for the two\nhad agreed in principle to create a new\nprime minister\u2019s post for the opposi-tion, but they failed to agree over just\nhow much power such a post would\ncarry. In addition, according to the\nKenyan media, the government has\nback-tracked on pledges to offer the\nopposition some real power.\nThis is disappointing as after the first\nfew days of talks intended to find a solution to the Kenyan election crisis,\nthe impressions emanating from the\nroom where the Kenyan government\nand the opposition have been negotiating were generally quite positive. Officials from the government Party of\nNational Unity (PNU) and the opposition Orange Democratic Movement\n(ODM) were saying that \u201cprogress was\nbeing made\u201d.\nBut agreement was being found on\nstraightforward issues; the items at the\ntop of the agenda drawn up by former\nUN Secretary General Kofi Annan\nwere non-contentious. It was almost\nas if he was trying to get the two sides\ninto the habit of concurring because\nhe knew that the more complicated issues lay ahead, and they would be best\ntackled by two sides who have at least\nbeen able to find common ground\non something.\nCorrespondents have indicated\nthat the parties will not bow to\ninternational pressure, Condoleeza Rice coming in for\ncriticism regarding certain\ncomments that suggested\nthat bilateral relations\nbetween the US and\nKenya could suffer unless progress was made\nin negotiations. The\nKenyan Foreign Minister has countered this,\nciting that Kenya\u2019s international friends were free to support the\nnegotiation process but not to impose\nany kind of threatening solution on\nthe conflict.\nMr Annan, who has been residing\nin Kenya for more than a month in\nan attempt to reach a settlement, is\nexpected to now meet the African\nUnion head, Tanzanian President\nJakaya Kikwete, who is also in the\ncountry to help broker negotiations and discuss what solutions\ncan be reached. In Nairobi, residents have expressed their desire\nfor peace, fearing an even more\nviolent fallout from the political\ntensions. It is widely agreed now that\nthe two leaders will have to become\ndirectly involved in talks rather than\nacting through negotiators to maintain any kind of progress \u201cThe leaders\nhave to assume their responsibilities\nand become directly engaged in these\ntalks,\u201d Mr Annan said.\nBoth sides had agreed last week\nKenyan President Mwai Kibaki\nto create the post of prime minister,\nwhich would be taken by Mr Odinga,\nleading to hopes that a final deal was\nimmi- nent. However,\nthey still needed to finalise\nwhatpowers\nhe would\nhave. As\nwell as how to divide powers between\na prime minister and a president, the\nrivals are also split on sharing cabinet\npositions and the possibility of a new\nelection if the coalition collapses.\nThe opinion in Britain and indeed\nmuch of the West is that the Kenyan\narmy is now the best option to stop\na sectarian bloodbath occurring, one\nworse than the product of the violence\nthat erupted in December. The foreign\noffice minister for Africa, Asia and the\nUN, Mark Malloch-Brown, indicated\na serious risk of renewed bloodshed if\ntalks broke down irrevocably.\nThe violence had died down recently\nas a result of Annan\u2019s brokering\nof negotiations, but he called\na pause to the talks yesterday\nafter several fruitless weeks.\nHowever, western observers\nbelieve that extremists on\nboth sides have used the\nlull to regroup and prepare\nfor another, potentially\nbloodier, bout of violence\nin Kenya.\u201dWe\u2019re going to\nhave to stop the violence,\u201d\nMalloch-Brown said.\n\u201cThe Kenyan military is\nby far the best option.\nThe question is, can the\narmy be brought in, in a\nnon-divisive way?\u201d\nThe army is, unlike the\npolice, still respected by\nthe Kenyan public as a genuinely national and multi-ethnic\ninstitution, but its generals are\nincreasingly reluctant to involve\nthemselves because they want\nto maintain its status and unity.\nAnnan is believed to have now\nissued an ultimatum to Kibaki\nand Odinga, telling them they\nwere facing their last chance to\ncontain the conflict before it\ntore their country apart. \u201dThe\ntalks have not broken down,\u201d\nAnnan told reporters later.\n\u201cBut I am taking steps to make\nsure we accelerate the process and\ngive peace to the people as soon as\npossible.\u201d\nWhat is on the horizon for Kenya, an end to the political struggle\nor an escalation of the violence that\ncould eventually bring the country\nto its knees?\n\u201cThe army is the\nbest option to\nstop a sectarian\nbloodbath\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nFriday 7 March 2008 felix\nArts\nTom Chandler tells us about his... interesting... experiences in Dramsoc, directing Les Liaisons Dangereuses\nConfessions of a student director\nY\nou see, I don\u2019t really know\nhow I got to the position\nI\u2019m in now. At some point\nI must have mentioned\nthat I\u2019d be interested in directing a play, because the next thing\nI knew I was being offered one. From\nthat, somehow, I got here: sitting next\ndoor to a room full of actors undressing for a Felix centrefold.\nPerhaps I should explain. From the\nbeginning. I had begun my final year\nat Imperial, and whilst I had greatly\nenjoyed myself until then, I had never\ntaken advantage of the huge variety of\nclubs and societies the Union has to\noffer. I like going to the theatre (who\ndoesn\u2019t, right?) so I thought to myself,\nif I were to get involved in a society, it\nshould be something I enjoy. So, forgetting that I already had two years of\nthe Imperial grind under my belt, and\nmaking a mental note to stock up on\nbiros for the term while I was about it, I\nrocked up to Fresher\u2019s fair and headed\nto the DramSoc stall. I had been to a\nfew DramSoc performances, and as\nwell as thoroughly enjoying myself,\nthe level of talent and technical quality of peformances had impressed\nme. Their flyer mentioned something\nabout DramSoc Fresher\u2019s workshops\n\u2013 to get newcomers involved, show\nthem around and see what the society\nis about \u2013 so the next weekend I found\nmyself there. And that\u2019s where it all begins to take off.\nI bumped into a friend, who after a\nfew minutes of chit-chat tells me she\u2019s\nstage managing the Fresher\u2019s play and\nwould I like to assist her? \u2018Great!\u2019, I\nthought \u2013 I\u2019m in there already, and it\u2019s\nmy first day! Fatally, I would later let\nslip to this same friend that I might be\ninterested in directing. A few whispers\non the grapevine later and I find myself before a committee of few familiar\nfaces, proposing a play called \u2018Les Liaisons Dangereuses\u2019. You can see how\neverything has kind of snowballed.\nA couple of nail-biting weeks, involving some major prostitution of myself\nin order to put together a production\nteam, I find myself back outside the\nDramSoc \u2018store room\u2019, awaiting the\nnow sightly more familiar committee\u2019s\ndecision. Who knows what happened\non the other side of that door, or which\ngods smiled down on me, for after being summoned back in, I heard the\ngreat news: \u2018Les Liaisons Dangereuses\u2019\nwas to be the next DramSoc play. Less\nthan two weeks, 27 auditions and many\ntough decisions later, the play had a\ncast. Now what on earth was I going to\ndo with them?\nI had a vague idea what would be required of me \u2013 now I just had to conceal quite how vague an idea that was\nfrom the actors. Directing tip number\none: the most important part of gaining respect and maintaining discipline\namong actors \u2013 who, incidentally, are\nan unruly lot \u2013 is to pretend you know\nwhat\u2019s going on. In a sense it\u2019s much\nlike acting, but in real life. Sounding\nconfident and making it look like you\u2019re\nwriting purposeful notes in the margin\nof your script is particularly advantageous to this end. But somehow, while\nI was pretending to know how they\nshould be acting, things started coming together in a way I hadn\u2019t expected.\nI was getting a feel for this.\nIn the rollercoaster ride that is di-recting, this was the calm point on the\nlong ascent when you start trusting\nthat your seat belt will hold and sneak-a-peak at the view. Spoke too soon,\nway too soon.\nThe stomach-twisting plummet back\ndown. Directing unfortunately adheres\nto the rest of life: it\u2019s always the things\nyou least expect.\nLes Liaisons Dangereuses is a passionate piece of work, and as with\nevery good play of this type, there is no\nshortage of time spent in the bedroom\n(not to mention the chaise-longue, or,\ngiven half the chance, the floor)! It\u2019s all\nvery well dealing with passion (some-thing one might have experienced), and\ntrying to make the amore between two\ncharacters look realistic; even directing prostitute encounters is okay, but a\nrape scene? How do you ask someone\nto pretend they\u2019re being violated? How\ndo you get it to look realistic without\nmaking the actors feel uncomfortable?\nDirecting tip number two: I recommend having the lower inside leg as\nPosition A, upper thigh as Position B.\n\u201cNow page 48. Valmont: when you say\n\u2018Lets just get ourselves more comforta-ble, shall we?\u2019 can you move your hand\nbetween Positions A and B...\u201d\nSecond mildly unanticipated struggle\nhas been getting Sami (the aforementioned Valmont) to keep his clothes on\nin some of the scenes. There may be a\nsilver lining to this problem, though,\ncondidering what they are up to next\ndoor [see this week\u2019s centrefold for the\nresults]. He must be in his element in\nthere. Moments before going in he\nwas performing the male equivalent of\nmake-up: his exercise regime. Apparently he\u2019s been at it for 8 weeks. Pressups, sit-ups, skips; hundreds of them\n\u2013 every day!\nI fear that I might be giving the wrong\nimpression. I\u2019m loving this \u2013 directing\nI mean. It hasn\u2019t been easy getting to\nthis stage. There have been times (like\nyesterday, today, and tomorrow I ex-pect) when coursework has piled up to\nsuch an extent that I doubt an ending\nstill exists. But I\u2019ve never been alone.\nI have received lots of suport from the\nDramSoc committee; ranging from tips\non how to keep my troublesome wards\nin line, to the organisation of the most\ncomprehensive and, frankly, beautiful publicity campaign the society has\nseen. (Have to keep them sweet, you\nsee, otherwise they\u2019ll make me write\nanother article!). Look out for post-ers, flyers on the walkway, a projection\non the union building, a stunt or two\naround campus, and the outcome of\nall the white face paint, hairspray and\nclutched material that I\u2019ve seen walking in next door. (Flick to the centre of\nthis publication for the last one.)\nSure, there have been times when I\ndidn\u2019t think we would ever get to where\nwe are now. Times I thought half the\nplay would need prompting; times I\nthought the duel would consist of picking up the swords and someone losing\nan eye. Multiple times when I was convinced that we\u2019d never get through the\nwhole play without someone cracking\nup. But it\u2019s pulled together so much in\nthe last few weeks, I can honestly say I\nam proud to put my name to it.\nMy only regret, in my final year, is\nthat I didn\u2019t sadlle-up into this directing fayre ride sooner.\nLes Liaisons Dangereuses is showing\nat the Union Concert Hall this week,\nfrom Wednesday 12th to Saturday\n15th March.\nTo direct properly one must practice \u2018the disapproving eyebrow\u2019\nStage combat is like real combat, but with less posing and flouncing\nThe essential eye-extraction phase of the rehearsal period.

This date marked a true turning\npoint in which the world\u2019s, and especially North America\u2019s, population began seeing the reality that Man has few,\nif any, limits when it comes to cruelty\nand destruction of the species. The domains affected by terrorism are mani-fold; everything from daily family life\ndynamics to social interactions have\nsuffered severe change. The economy\nis no exception to this. Even in the long\nterm, terrorist acts leave deep scars. In\norder to minimize the impact on the\neconomy (and not only) it is necessary\nto identify the roots of this problem.\nTerrorism is a resorting to violence;\nbe this physical or psychological. It is\nusually orchestrated by a group or an\nindividual in an attempt to reach a certain political or social goal \u2013 usually a\nsynergy of the two. A terrorist is, by\nlogic and definition, one who practices\nterrorism. In our times, however, terrorism has reached monumental pro-portions, with a complex network behind each attack. The individual that\nwe usually consider to be responsible,\nthe bomb carrier, is more often than\nnot a low ranking member of a hierarchical pyramid. It is often difficult\nto understand the justification behind\nthis person\u2019s desire to end his or her life\nin the process. It is part of a so-called\nprocess of brainwashing. These individuals are not the root of the problem,\nbut are merely its operational and logistical parts.\nThe consequences of these heinous\nacts are not limited to the massive\nlosses occurred at the moment of the\nattack. These acts absolutely condition the behaviour of future events,\nincluding the behaviour of people as\nwell as the pace of the economy. The\ntourism sector is often utilised as a\ntarget for attacks, given the enormous\nmediatic projection and audience.\nCountries that are heavily dependant\non this sector and suffer an unfortunate terrorist incident will very often\nsuffer a substantial downturn in revenue that translates into a decay in the\ncountry\u2019s performance. On the other\nhand, movements of capital between\ncountries will be strongly influenced.\nEven though the risk of terrorism constitutes only a small percentage of the\noverall global economic risk, multinational companies are typically and\nunderstandably more inclined to make\ninvestments in countries where terrorism is less likely to happen. Direct\nforeign investment will therefore suffer\na reduction that will not be seen exclusively in short-term time frames. For\ndeveloping countries, this fact will halt\nthe diffusion of technical and economical know-how that is frequently essential to the country\u2019s future growth.\nNot least important are the costs\nthat some economists call the \u201cterrorism tax\u201d. This refers mainly to the costs\nincurred by the increased government\nspending to ensure and preserve a climate of safety, or at least the perception of existence of this state. These\nare measures that reroute and channel\ntime and resources from other activities that are far more productive to an\neconomy and the well-being of a coun-try. Even though these measures may\nforce a downturn in productivity, especially in the long-term, they are necessary to make the occurrence of terrorist attacks less frequent.\nGrave consequences definitely condition the future of not only the pace\nof the economy, but of society in the\nbroader sense of the word. It is therefore necessary to act on two axes; on\none side, actions must be taken to\nminimise the negative effects of past\nGet on, get focused and get ahead!\nFind out more at www.imperial.ac.uk/\ncareers or visit us at level 5 Sherfield\nBuilding.

An appreciation of the commercial context in which your chosen\nindustry operates is also important.\nIf you have read the above list with\ngathering gloom then don\u2019t worry, as\nthere are lots of things which you can\ndo to try and improve your knowledge.\nYour past experience of work through\npart-time or vacation employment will\nhopefully have given you some insight\ninto how a business or organisation op-erates.

This brings forth the question of\nterrorism financing. Large influxes of\ncapital are needed to make possible a\nlarge-scale terrorist operation. It is in\nthis sense that more regulation may\nbe necessary in the domain of offshore\nbanking utilized by terrorist groups\nto finance their activity. For this to\nhappen, it is paramount to have total\nglobal co-operation, which is not an\noverly utopian idea, given that this is\na worldwide problem, never restricted\nto a small region. There are, however,\ninherent and influential interests in\nthe keeping of these offshores. These\nrange from perfectly harmless private\nequity firms and investment funds to\nthe tax-haven\u2019s own interests in keeping money flowing into what is otherwise a relatively poor economy.\nThe long-term impact of terrorism\nis already visible and so are some of\nthe reasons why it is difficult to put an\nend to it. The most evident lies in the\nnon-regulation of some offshore accounts also used by terrorist groups.\nIf this is a global concern, it requires\nglobal efforts. Economies that are\nunwilling to receive international cooperation must by all means be considered accomplices to terrorist attacks to come. One must remember\nthat there is a monumental difference\nbetween a fiscal paradise and a financial paradise; the former has clear tax\nand fiscal advantages, while the latter\nhas motivations that are anything but\ntransparent.\nYou can network with recent graduates from multi-national companies\nand also further develop a range of key\nskills through working alongside fellow students and managers from major\nemployers such as BP, Rolls Royce and\nCRA International on business case\nstudies.

There are some\nbig names in the running including the\nincumbent mayor Ken Livingstone, the\none and only Boris Johnson and Brian\nPaddick, a former senior police of-ficer. In addition, there are many well\nrespected and noteworthy candidates\nfrom outside the three main political\nparties. Si\u00e2n Berry is standing for the\nGreen party and she recently visited\nthe stoic tv studio to tell us about her\nplans for London.\nThe Green party currently has two\nseats on the London Assembly (the\nbody which scrutinises the mayor\u2019s\ndecisions and has the power to change\nthe annual budget). They have already\nhelped to triple the cycling budget,\nmake walking around London easier\nand encouraged the selling of more local food. The greens are certainly not\nnew to London politics and have proven that they are a viable option.\nIf elected, Si\u00e2n Berry would bring\nin cheaper public transport so that it\ncould compete effectively with cars.\nThe money to support cheaper fares\nwould come from the effect of more\npeople using the system and the scrapping of unnecessary projects such as\nthe Thames Gateway Road Bridge. The\ncongestion charge would remain as it\nappears to have been a success; traffic\ngrowth has stopped in contrast with\nSi\u00e2n Berry taking questions in the stoic tv studio\nthe rest of the country, but it can still\nbe improved. She successfully campaigned for the introduction of the\nemissions-related congestion charge,\nwhich needs to be tightened further to\ncover more vehicles. She was critical\nof Brian Paddick, who has suggested\nincreasing the size of the congestion\ncharge zone to cover Greater London.\nInstead a more sophisticated method\nof road charging should be brought in.\nOne of the big issues for students\nin London is affordable housing; as\nmayor she would aim to increase the\nnumber of houses for rent and keep\nhouse prices low. There are thousands\nof empty houses in London and many\nsecond homes which national policy\nshould be tackling with higher taxes.\nThere are also many brown field sites\navailable; however the majority are\ncurrently used for commercial purpos-es. As mayor she would stop this trend\nand build more affordable homes and\nrenovate empty properties. One of the\nmain priorities with existing housing\nwould be to install good insulation in\nall homes to make them more energy\nefficient which would help to reduce\nour energy deficit; a problem the government hopes to solve with nuclear\npower. A power source which generates hazardous waste for which there\nis no method of long term disposal;\nclearly a safer option is needed.\nShe\u2019s sceptical that many people will\nvote for Boris.

If you were\naround during Freshers' Week, you\nmay have stumbled into dB's for Kids\nWill Be Skeletons and All Hands On\nDeck's gig night, where Riot Noise\nheadlined. Many of you will have\nconsumed a ridiculous amount of alcohol by this point (as well as having\nhad your ears raped by that Geldof\ngirl DJing) but those who remained,\nindeed, witnessed ROCK in the mak-ing. Not only did this band manage to\nconvince two ladies (who must have\nbeen freshers straight out of an all girls'\nschool) to let all five members stay in\ntheir halls (sadly the band decided the\ncramped man-gasm ride home at 3am\nwas a better offer), but the gloriously\nlong-haired frontman, Marty, recently\nused Level 10 gift-of-the-gab to get\nbackstage at a Guns'n'Roses gig and\nthen party with the Rose.\nBack in their hometown of Bristol, Riot Noise are slowly becoming a\nmuch \u2013 talked about band in their own\nright. They formed from the remaining\nmembers of Red Top Matches less than\na year ago but they are already beginning a 3-week tour of the States next\nweek. This band, I must admit, have\ntaken a lot of flak. Although my boyfriend thought they're great, I remained\nhighly unconvinced. Considering my\nboo's top bands spanned Motley Crue,\nFaith No More, Husker Du and a hint\nof Weezer; what the hell was I letting\nmy ears (and possibly eyes if it's circa\ndrag-queen Motley Crue era) in for?\nIt was a spiritual awakening of the\nmusical kind. Spiritual, if we replace\nJesus with a fallen Axl Rose and God\nwith Gene Simmons, or Bruce Dickinson (he looks pretty regal). I'm a child\nof the 90's and will always be true to\nthat. My teenage years were dominated by Nu Metal; Slipknot, Linkin Park\n(shudder) and Marliyn Manson. I am\nnot ashamed to say this, no matter how\nmuch I've grown out of it! However, I'm\nalso a peripheral child of the '80's and\nI'm very glad that my generation is one\nof the last to fully appreciate the origins of rock music today; Beastie Boys,\nAC/DC, Queen, KISS, Sex Pistols; they\nall put in their own contributions. Unfortunately I never saw these bands\nin their heyday; reunion gigs are one\nthing, but it's the drugged-up, puking\non stage, Nikki Sixx that I really, really\nwant to see. Some bands have recreated this essence (although without the\ndrugs and body mess) extremely well;\nQOTSA and even, to some extent, The\nDarkness and Mika. Riot Noise excel\nwhere these bands can't producing\nno frills, straight-up hard rock that is\nreminiscent of Sunset Strip in '84. With\nsongs like 'Fight the People' (quite Rage\nAgainst the Machine-y) and 'San Fransisco' with guitar solos from the greatest guitarist I've seen in my 19 years\non Earth, it's hard to fault Riot Noise\ntechnically. Each song is crafted with\nstyle and their work ethic is undoubtedly notable; two practices a week and\nLia Han\nIC Radio\nWhat a charming individual\na tour in America with Tattooed Millionaires (as well as supporting Electric\nSix) \u2013 it's a joyous sight to see the band\nstill letting loose on stage.\nThere is one BUT.

With support from Rita and Pav,\nLily booted the ball over the heads of\nthe defenders. They were outpaced by\nChin, who then proceeded to chip the\ngoalkeeper from the left.\nOn the right, Steph and Emma held\nthe storm of Winchester players back,\nfully frustrating them. Plus, with Kate\nand Yoke as centre backs, Winchester\nhad nuthin\u2019 on IC. Various chances\nwere created at the other end but unfortunately for IC the ball refused to go\nin, including a wonder shot from Chloe\nwhich came off the cross bar.\nChin\u2019s second goal came a little later\non from another through ball from\nLily. Once again Chin outran the defenders with her gazelle-like legs. To\nWinchester\u2019s disbelief, she ran through\ntheir backline and netted the ball, easy\nas pie. The IC team, in a state of con-fusion, took about a minute to realize\nthey were 2-0 up.\nWinchester began to get more aggressive and finally began to break\nthrough the IC defence, using their\nlumpy pitch to their advantage. Many\nof their crosses, however, were unable\nto connect with their strikers. Cheryl,\nin a spirit of generosity, got in the way\nof a cross which took a deflection, gifting Winchester with a goal and a glimmer of hope before half time.\nThe second half started with Winchester clearly out for blood. They\nwere now shooting downhill and bore\ndown on the IC goal in a tide of really\nbig girls. IC fell back to defend with\nChloe and Rita making crucial tackles\nwhich prompted a Winchester striker\nto shout unpleasant things at Rita, who\nwas about to respond in a string of rude\nWomen\u2019s football into semis\nICU baby\u2026 shaking that ass\nLast Saturday two eights left Imperial Boatclub at 5am to race in Bruges,\nBelgium.\nAfter a few setbacks (caused largely\nby the attempt to navigate to a small\nboatclub in a foreign city without any\nform of map and/or directions), both\ncrews and boats managed to arrive in\ntime for a 12:30 race.\nConditions were especially difficult,\nwith a roaring headwind during the\nwarm-up, along with waves breaking\ninto the bows of the boats. For the senior eight, going off 2nd, the start was\nsomewhat shaky. However, a rhythm\nwas soon found and by halfway the\ncrew were almost upon the boat in\nfront.\nAfter overtaking, the speed was\nmaintained to finish powerfully and\nwin the race overall, in a time faster\nthan all other crews. Crucially, the\neight beat opposition that had a few\nweeks previously beaten us by 25 sec-onds, underlining the improvement in\nspeed as a result of recent training.\nIn addition, the novice eight performed well, beating some far more\nexperienced opposition and handling\nthe conditions very well. That the crew\nwere able to compete among senior\ncrews is all the more impressive considering the fact that most of the eight\nrowers had first got in a boat only five\nmonths previously.\nThe obligatory post-race celebrations were quickly begun with vigour.\nIn particular, veteran Nigel Atkins was\nkeen to sample the impressive range of\nbeers on offer, and finished the night\nby sampling the local variety of kebab\n(twice). Other club members were\nsimilarly keen to sample other aspects\nof Belgian culture, and see what the\nBelgians could offer.\nThoughtfully, a long training session was scheduled the next morning\nat 7:30 am to help everyone out with\ntheir hangovers. This involved a \u201816\nkilometre\u2019 outing to the \u2018nearby\u2019 port\nof Ostend, complete with headwind\nand conditions somewhat akin to the\nEnglish Channel. With this productive,\nalbeit painful, row concluded, the club\nloaded boats and began the long drive\nhome.\nThe Head of the River Race, raced\non the Boat Race course and one of the\nmost important races in the rowing\ncalendar, is on the 15th March.\nWith an entry of around 430 crews\nand over 3000 athletes, this is traditionally an event Imperial College\ndominate.\nThe results from Bruges indicate that\nthis should once again be the case if the\nclub maintains its current momentum\nand focus.\nImperial Boat Club\ninvades Belgium\nIain Palmer\nPortuguese words had the referee not\nyelled at them to stop it. Minutes later the same Winchester striker chose\nto pick a fight with Kate, who would\nhave been up for it despite being half\na head shorter. Tension was mounting\nand Winchester players began mowing\nIC players down but as always Emma\nsaved the day, multiple times.\nPav sealed the deal for IC seven minutes before full time. Steph made a\nmultitude of crosses giving the IC forwards plenty of goal scoring opportu-nities. Pav pounced on the ball that refused to go in for shots from everyone\nelse and slipped it into the back of the\nWinchester net effortlessly. The game\nended 3-1 to IC Women\u2019s, meaning we\nwere through.\nBUSA plate semi-finals in some ridiculous middle-of-no-where \u2018away\u2019\nlocation, here we come!\nDance club report on the Southern Universities Dance Competition, see page 46\n\n"

    "content": "news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nFriday 7 March 2008 felix\nNews\nQuest to find Sabbaticals complete\nJennifer Morgan elected as Union President. Felix welcomes the Union\u2019s new Sabbatical Overlords with pies\nLast Friday, the 2008 Union Election\nresults were announced. After week\u2019s\nof campaigning and preparation the\nSabbatical Officer, NUS Delegate and\nStudent Trustee candidates were finally told the outcome of the elections\nand put out of their misery. To give\nnext year\u2019s Sabbaticals Officers an ear-ly, hearty welcome, Felix employed the\nCity & Guilds Hit Squad to pie them.\nThe election results were revealed to\na packed crowd which filled out daVinci\u2019s last Friday night. Returning Officer, Danny McGuinness, announced\nthe majority of the results over the PA\nsystem; however, the Presidential candidates were momentarily left in suspense when the microphone ceased to\nfunction. Eventually, the audience was\ntold that current RCSU (Royal College\nof Science Union) President, Jennifer\nMorgan, would be next year\u2019s Union\nPresident winning with 1011 votes out\nof 2314 in total. Although Miss Morgan beat her nearest competitor, Jon\nMatthews, by almost 200 votes, the\nrace for the Presidency was actually far\ntighter than the final figures suggest.\nMr Matthews was in line to become\nPresident after the first three stages of\nvote counting; however, because of redistributed votes, Miss Morgan clawed\nher way back into a winning position.\nThe Union used the Single Transferable Voting (STV) system in the elections meaning that voters could rank\nthe candidates in order of preference.\nIf a voter\u2019s highest-ranked candidate\nwas knocked out, their vote was redistributed to their second choice and so\non.\nCurrent Social Clubs Committee\n(SCC) Chair, Lily Topham, will be next\nyear\u2019s Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) winning by over 200 votes in\nthe final round. It was widely believed\nthat John James would fare well in this\nstrand after a strong campaign (he\u2019s\nthe one you probably saw carrying a giant \u2018Refreshers\u2019 tube around campus),\nhowever the experienced SCC Chair\ntoppled the competition convincingly\nin the end.\nThe most surprising result was in the\nDeputy President (Education & Welfare) category where Environmental\nSociety stalwart, Hannah Theodorou,\ndefeated her sole competitor Ryan\nDee despite a non-existant campaign\nstrategy.\nUpset was avoided in the Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) cat-egory, where recent Felix centrefold\nstar, Christian Carter, defeated RON\nby 1155 to 596 votes.\nFinally, the next Felix Editor was determined to be Jovan Nedi\u0107. This year\u2019s\nSports Editor narrowly beat Nightlife\nEditor, Greg Mead, by 78 votes.\nFor a full breakdown see the box-out\nof the Sabbatical Election results.\nElsewhere, both candidates running\nfor Student Trustee positions were\nelected, namely Kadhim Shubber and\nJaimie Henry. Kirsty Patterson, Victoria Gibbs, Elizabeth Hyde, Camilla\nRoyle, Ashley Brown, Jon Matthews,\nLuke Taylor and Jennifer Morgan were\nelected as NUS Delegates; however Mr\nMatthews has since relinquished the\nposition.\nOn Wednesday, Felix arranged/\nstaged a lunchtime photo-shoot for\nthe winning candidates. The incoming\nSabbaticals were asked to meet outside\nthe main Union building at 11:45am.\nFelix didn\u2019t intend for the shoot to\nbe a test of the candidates\u2019 punctual-ity; however, with both Miss Topham\nand Miss Theodorou arriving late and\nmissing the photo-shoot, we should\nhave brought a stopwatch.\nEventually, everyone tired of waiting\nand it was decided to have the \u201cgroup\u201d\nphoto taken with just the new President, DPFS and Felix Editor. Right on\ncue, after a few snaps the City & Guilds\n(C&G) Hit Squad burst through the\ngathered crowd of sportsmen and\nwomen, launching paper plates of\nshaving foam into the faces of the incoming Sabbatical Officers.\nThe C&G Hit Squad offers its services once a year during RAG Week. Students could employ the Squad, much\nlike contract killers, to carry out a hit\nby paying them a fee. Unlike contract\nkillers, the fee is given to charity; this\nyear\u2019s RAG Week was raising money\nfor Cancer Research UK, The Newman\nHoliday Trust and Practical Action.\nShortly after the initial hit, Miss\nTopham turned up looking relieved\nthat she\u2019d missed a flan to the face but\nalso concerned that the Hit Squad had\nan unfulfilled contract. Surely enough,\nher time came but she wasn\u2019t going\nto be flanned without a fight, as she\nfended off one Hit Squad member by\nswinging a heavy bag of books at him.\nMiss Theodorou was more willing to\naccept her fate when she finally arrived,\ntaking some foam to the forehead.\nNext year\u2019s Sabbatical Officers will\nhave to tackle a number of crucial is-sues. Now that the second phase of the\nBeit Redevelopment has been given\nthe go ahead, they will be tasked with\nseeing it through to completion and\nensuring hiccups are avoided along\nthe way. Similarly, the Sabbs will need\nto begin to secure funding for the final phase of the redevelopment which\nwill see the rejuvenation of the Union\u2019s\nbars. On a national scale, they\u2019ll be\nresponsible for deciding what the hell\nwe\u2019re going to do with the NUS even\nthough we rejoined over a year ago,\nplus they\u2019ll need to fight for students\u2019\nviews during the Top-up Fee Funding\nReview taking place next year.\nFelix would like to take this opportunity to wish them all the best of luck.\nBreak the Union a leg!\nRector pied: City & Guilds\nHit Squad strikes again\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nAt lunchtime on Tuesday the Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, received\nhis annual pie to the face courtesy of two primates from the C&G\nHit Squad. The Rector, who just happened to be walking down\nthe Sherfield Walkway at around about 12pm when this reporter\nalso just happened to be getting his lunch from the JCR, was\nconfronted by the two assailants who planted a shaving foam flan\ninto his mush.

Harrington\u2019s vocals are very immediate,\nand throw in some poetic lyrics (\u201cShe\nmoved like smoke and sounded like\nice\u201d) and you have the makings of a\ngreat song.\n\u2018The Sweat Descends\u2019 opens with a\nfew notes not sounding too unlike the\nYeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 \u2018Y Control\u2019, but when\nHarrington\u2019s fierce, yelpy vocals once\nagain enter, we know we are getting\nsomething altogether more different.\nIt\u2019s a very energetic song, and never\nfails to keep your interest throughout.\nThese are two very, very impressive songs, and I would urge anyone\nto seek these out \u2013 you won\u2019t be left\ndisappointed.\nMit Shah\nThe Tunics\nCost Of Living\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nAt first, you could be forgiven for confusing this band with so many other\nrock groups we\u2019ve heard over the last\nfew years \u2013 their sound rings so many\nbells. Listen a bit harder, though, and\nyou notice that unlike all the other\nbands with their inane lyrics, these\nguys have tried to provoke thought\nand possibly even emotion with \u2018Cost\nof Living\u2019. The track is also very well\nproduced, so it sounds pretty nice.\nDefinitely worth a listen!\nChris Birkett\nIda Maria\nStella\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\n\u2018Stella\u2019 tells the story of God giving the\nworld away to a 43-year-old prostitute\nfrom Manhattan in return for a night\nwith her, and musically is almost as\ninnovative as the theme. The tune is\ncatchy and the chorus memorable. Ida\nMaria\u2019s vocals, quite hoarse at times,\nare reminiscent of Janis Joplin, whereas the manner in which she sings and\nlyrics themselves resemble the work of\nLou Reed. A lively single, fairly different from usual mainstreem indie but\nstill without that much to brag about.\nIt will, however, attract listeners of various musical styles.\nKate Agathos\nThe SeLF\nSomebody Nobody\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nThe new single from The SeLF captures the feel of The Verve at their an-themic best. As a mid tempo sound-scape seeps from the guitars, singer\nHerman Stephens delivers heartfelt\nlyrics of substance with aplomb. The\nway the song ebbs back and forth from\nverse to chorus in an uncomplicated\nstructure makes the track easy to listen\nto, yet also emphasises the songs towering nature. If The SeLF can produce\nan album\u2019s worth of songs like this, expect them to be leading thousands of\nlighter-holding fans at a festival soon.\nNat Roocroft\nMit unleash German electro-mayhem\nOne Little Plane + Born\nRuffians + Mit\nCamden Barfly\nA couple of Saturdays ago, I was treated to a trio of semi-underground music at \u2018Kill \u2018Em All\u2019, held at The Camden\nBarfly. The venue itself is a nice little\nplace \u2013 although part of a large chain\nof venues with locations all around the\nUK, the Camden branch manages to\nmaintain an individual feel and an intimate atmosphere. I\u2019m not sure if it was\ndue to the trendy Camden folk it has as\nclientele, the general grotty-chic of the\nplace, or the reasonably priced Brothers , but either way it has my approval.\nAnd the nice bag check-in man was\na Ghostface Killah fan, so there were\nthumbs up all round.\nThe first band of the night was an unsigned acoustic singer One Little Plane,\nstage name for singer/songwriter Kathryn Bint. Admittedly, as soon as the\nacoustic guitar is taken from its case\nand a young hippy-esque lady stepped\nup to the microphone, there was a\nsmall but detectable wave of \u2018here we\ngo again\u2019 which made its way around\nthe room, constructively interfering\nin my eyes and throat which promptly\nrolled and scoffed respectively. I was\nsoon eating my scoff however as, far\nfrom the 60\u2019s knock-off clich\u00e9 I was\nexpecting, Kathryn Bint makes lovely\nmusic. Her voice is wispy and ethereal,\nperfectly matched to the nostalgic, poetic lyrics, rich in metaphor and oooh\njust loveliness. Also, I later found out\nthe innocuous backing guitarist was\nKieran Hebden (Four Tet), which was\nrather unexpected.\nBorn Ruffians were next up, a Toronto based indie band, treating us to\nsome tone-saturated guitar twangs and\nlyrics about being a teenager and the\nlike. Admittedly, I\u2019m not a fan of indie\nat the best of times, but their set really was a low point, embodying most\nindie boy clich\u00e9s I could think of. Cardigans, predictable 4:4 timings punctuated by pretentious 18-29s here and\nthere to mix it up a bit, falsetto tones.\nYes, Jeff Buckley made it OK, but Jeff\nBuckley could pull it off. Listening to\na couple of tracks on their Myspace\nafterwords made my opinion soften a\nbit. Although it pains me to admit it,\nthey have some catchy tunes, and the\nlyrics aren\u2019t ALL about being a teenager and getting dumped. Some, such\nas \u2018Foxes Mate For Life\u2019 are quite witty\nand intelligent (it\u2019s because they are in\nlove). Generally, though, I had a very\nnegative impression of this band after\nthey had left the stage. Not my cup of\nDarjeeling.\nThe final set and main event of the\nnight was an absolutely stunning performance by German electro three-piece MIT. It\u2019s hard writing about music you love without sounding over the\nThe music itself was enough to make\ntheir set good, but it was the stage\nperformance of the band, vocalist Edi\nWinarni in particular, which made\nit excellent. Singing in a mixture of\nGerman and English, the combination of his feminine voice and visceral\ndelivery made the performance both\nfundamentally unnerving and breath-taking.\nSadly, after a brief visit to the UK,\nMIT are back in Germany for a while,\nbut if you happen to be in Manchester\nin May you can catch them on the 1st.\nGo see this band if you get the chance.\nSo that was my night at \u2018Kill \u2018Em\nAll\u2019. After the bands finished we went\ndownstairs and got pissed while dancing to filthy electro remixes of 90s RnB\ntunes, courtesy of The Filthy Dukes.\nAlthough it took me well over an hour\nto get home from Camden, I went to\nsleep happily tapping my feet and trying to make my mouth sound like a\nMoog.\nPeter Sinclair\ntop and ridiculous, but this was probably the best set I have seen in I don\u2019t\nknow how long. Comparisons between\nMIT and their electro-Germanic forefathers Kraftwerk seem to be made\nwhenever they are mentioned (which\nhas been regularly recently due to an\nup-coming album), however apart\nfrom being German and being suckers for the Moog, the two bands have\nlittle in common. MIT\u2019s sound seems\nto have evolved from much heavier,\ndarker roots, using the electronic edge\nto make their sound more menacing\nwhile remaining danceable. Like that\nscene in Blade where all the vampires\nare dancing in the club before Blade\ncomes in and slaughters them all.\nThink \u2018The Knife\u2019, but less poppy and\nwithout the chilly Nordic feel.\nEdi Winarni going fucking mental\nMit at the Camden Barfly. Photographs by James Houghton\nThose indie buffs amongst you may\nremember James Rutledge as part of\nthe early naughties band The Dakota\nOak Trio until the tragic death of co-member Dave Tyack \u2013 a tragedy that\nhad a profound impact upon Rutledge\nwho stepped back from music for a few\nyears, only to remerge in his latest reincarnation \u2013 sampling god Pedro.\nYou, Me & Everyone is a truly enigmatic album where track boundaries\nhave no meaning, themes and melodies slide in and out to be repeated\nlater, and a diverse range\nof influences\nare combined\n(in-cluding\nfree jazz,\npsych-edelics,\nAfrican rhythms,\nhip-hop, electronic and classical genres) to create a beautifully crafted musical Tower\nof Babel.\nThis album should come with a\nhealth warning \u2013 it\u2019s a form of psychological graffiti. It is really probably\nbest for those naughty, naughty people\namongst you who may or may not dabble in certain cheeky forms of herbal\ncigarettes to stay sober whilst listening\nto it, or risk succumbing to the mental\naura of mind-bending samples in a way\nthat left The Beta Band\u2019s lone pigeon\nwandering the streets barefoot for\nthree years.\nPerhaps put best in his own words,\nafter spending a prolonged period\nlistening to jazz and primitive noise,\nRutledge quite literally dreamt up\nYou, Me & Everyone one night. \u201cI was\nwalking around the corridors of my\nold secondary school, and I could hear\nthe album being played by this strange\nband of about 100 people. I could hear\ndifferent parts of the music that I\u2019d\nbeen working on repeating and sliding\ninto earshot as I tried\nto find where\nit was\ncoming\nfrom.\nWhen\nI finally\ngot to the\ngym, they\nhad finished playing\nand were all stood\nstaring at me. It\nwas glorious and\nterrifying.\u201d\nGlorious and terrifying indeed. You\njoin the album by stepping over the\nbody of a comatose biker into a party\nthat is already well-established, and\ntentatively open a door into to a room\nwhere a pink rainbow flows into a\nhuddle of tiny penguins. Uber trendies wearing 80\u2019s style futuristic shades\nmingle with kids from the ghetto, shaven headed monks sit on the floor playing xylophones as, all dressed in black\ntie, three members of the London Symphonic squeeze past with their instruments to the next room. When \u2018Spools\u2019\nreverses into your consciousness you\ncan\u2019t quite remember what street you\nlive on, but it doesn\u2019t matter because\nyou\u2019re having a damn good time, but\nthat woosy feeling you\u2019re experiencing\npersists into \u2018Lung\u2019 and you go around\ntelling everyone the guy on the decks\nreally is DJ Shadow. Then, feeling a tad\nbit pale, you\u2019re hit by a blast of syncopated beats and you realise you\u2019re well\non the way to your first ever musical\nwhitie.\nBy \u2018Green apples\u2019 the middle-aged\nman with the pink shades and grey hair\n(who you suspect never escaped the\nsummer of love) is handing you a glass\nof water and telling you to chill out\nand take it easy but unfortunately the\nsimmering flutes, twittering of birds\nand the improvisations of the 5-piece\njazz band jamming in the corner are\nall a bit too much to take for your poor\nconfused brain. In the end, You Me &\nNew album from Pedro out on the 8th of March \u2013 BUY IT\nPedro\nYou, Me and Everyone\nMush Records\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nJames Rutledge AKA Pedro\nEveryone packs up and rolls away in its\nVW Campervan on the back of a golden swan on a never ending acid trip,\nleaving you bleary eyed but satisfied\nthat you\u2019ve had one hell of time.\nSteven Burgess\n\n"

After that,\n\u201cOhh, wasn\u2019t that where the genocide\nhappened\u2026\u201d is the most common, pre-dictable, response; the sole hallmark\nof the country. True, the disaster was\nHitler\u2019s inspiration and the start to the\nbloodiest century of history. But to label the land a \u2018crater\u2019 and consign it to\na dusty memory box alongside Rwanda\nis to do the nation a disservice.\nAnyone who has played Rome: Total\nWar knows how much Armenia kicked\nancient ass (48 armoured-to-the-eyelid\ncataphracts? Hell yes!) For those poor\nsouls/console \u2018gamers,\u2019 who couldn\u2019t\ndifferentiate between a keyboard and\nan orchestra, Armenia is situated to\nthe south of the Steppes, to the east of\nCappadocia, in the Caucasus. Try adding those to your Word dictionary. To\nthe north lies Russia, the pinnacle of\nworld democracy, and Georgia, as stable and open as resting on an open stable door. East is Azerbaijan, who have\nbeen at war with Armenia since the\n1990\u2019s. South is Iran, and west lies Turkey, formerly the heartland of the Ottoman Empire and perpetrator of the\n1895-1917 genocide. And you thought\nyour neighbours were bad. Despite\nthis, the landscape is stunning, with\nmountains topped by snow, crystal\nclear rivers and a temperate climate.\nArmenia is one of the few countries\nwith a larger citizenry outside the borders than in. Although its population is\n3.2 million, most of whom live around\nthe capital Yerevan, around 8 million\nlive abroad, with high concentrations\nin the US, France and Italy. Arising\ncourtesy of Turkey, the diaspora contributes significantly to Armenia\u2019s\neconomy, which is supplemented by\nindustry, mining and oil processing.\nFamous Armenians? System Of A\nDown springs to mind for those mu-sic-lovers out there. Perhaps the most\ngrandiose is Maddox, a.k.a George\nI *heart* Armenia\nOuzounian, author of the popular and\ncontroversial site thebestpageinthe-universe.com. On the British side, we\nhave Natasha Shishmanian, the wife of\nChris Evans, and David Dickinson, Mr\nOrange himself.\nIf you believe the Old Testament,\nwe\u2019re all Armenian; Noah beached his\nocean liner on Mt Ararat (well, if we\nlisten to science, we\u2019re all Kenyan. Pfft.)\nMost of the current population belongs\nto the Armenian Apostolic Church.\nArmenia was, in fact, the first nation\nto declare Christianity as the state religion back in 301 CE. After a long spell\nas a vassal of Persia, Alexander the\nGreat, then the Seleucids, then Persia,\nthen Pontus, then Rome, subsequently\nsubdued it. Like two art students fighting over one remaining liquorice all-sort, Armenia changed hands multiple\ntimes between the Romans and the\nParthians. It was during this time that\na \u2018chivalric code\u2019 appeared amongst the\nmilitary of Armenia, alongside heavily armoured, lanced cavalry that both\nempires desired. Yep, you read that\nright: Armenia practically invented the\nknight in shining armour whilst Celts\nstill wore skirts in Londinium.\nAfter the fall of Rome, Armenia enjoyed a brief empire of its own, later\neven relocating to Cilicia, the bit of\ncoast north of Cyprus. Alas, it was not\nto last. An invasion (surprise, surprise)\nby the Islamic Caliphate led to hundreds more years of seesaw fighting\nbetween the Persians and the Ottomans. After two-thousand odd years of\noccupation, the Armenians had quite\nrightly had enough. The Ottomans,\nconvulsed with economic and political decay and grabbing nationalism,\nfeared a possible independence movement and felt fully justified in pillaging,\ndrowning, raping, looting, hanging and\nshooting all Armenians they found.\nHundreds of thousands were marched\nthrough the Syrian desert; those that\nfell were beaten and left on the rocks\nto die. The Young Turks were also kind\nenough to extend the same sympathetic treatment to the Assyrians and\nGreeks, whose settlements had existed\nin Anatolia for three millennia.\nAfter a short-lived period as a repub-lic, Armenia was incorporated into the\nUSSR. It gained independence in 1991\nand has since been a democracy. A\nmodern peace partner of NATO and a\nmember of the CIS and World Trade\nOrganisation, 78% of Armenians favour joining the EU.\nCurrently, the democracy of Armenia is under threat. This week, eight\npeople died after the army dispersed\na peaceful, \u2018illegal\u2019 protest in Yerevan.\nMany Armenians fear the election was\nrigged and their protests artificially\nburied in a week dominated by news\nof Russian and American elections.\nAll media outlets have been prevented from free broadcasting and public\ngatherings banned under military rule.\nThe worst riots since those against\nSoviet rule have thus gone unnoticed\naround the world.\nStill, with strong annual GDP\ngrowth, increasing Human Development Index, improving relations with\nthe US, EU and Turkey, and a possible\nresolution with Azerbaijan over the\nwar-torn Nagorno-Karabakh province\non the horizon, there is much going\nfor Armenia. Not since times long past\nhas Armenia had the opportunity to\nembrace a free future.\nScorpio\nF\nor more than 3,000 years\nPersia has been a melting pot\nof civilizations and demographic movements between\nAsia and Europe. Successive\ninvasions by the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols and Turks developed the nation\u2019s\nculture through rich and diverse phil-osophical, artistic, scientific and religious influences.\nThough the history of Iran is long\nand complex, its shape is determined\nby the rise and fall of successive dynasties \u2013 with intervals of chaos and\nconfusion. The most recent case of\ncomplexity is dominated by Iran-US\nrelations.\nPolitical relations between Iran and\nthe United States began in the late\n1800s but had little importance until\nthe post-World War II era of petroleum exports from the Persian Gulf.\nDespite the recent concerns and actions of the USA towards Iran\u2019s activities in terms of sanctions against Iran,\nby going back a few decades in time,\none finds the reflection and the cycle\nof history and perhaps the origins of\nthe hatred between U.S. and Iran.\nTo remember why the United States\nis no favourite of Tehran\u2019s, one needs\nto go back at least to 1953 when the\nU.S. and Great Britain overthrew Iran\u2019s\ndemocratically elected Premier Mohammad Mossadeq as part of a plan to\nensure access to Iranian oil.\nIranians also remember Washington\u2019s strong support for Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq after it decided to make war\non Iran in 1980. U.S. support for Iraq\n(which included an implicit condoning\nof Saddam\u2019s use of chemical weapons)\nwas perhaps the crucial factor in staving off an Iranian victory.\nUnder the Shah, the U.S was Iran\u2019s\nforemost economic and military part-ner. In fact, throughout the post-Sec-ond World War era and up to 1979, the\nemergence and existence of a powerful Iran was the core of the US policy\nunder various administrations (both\nRepublican and Democrat) as a vital\nsource of peace and stability in the\nMiddle East and Western Asia.\nAfter 1979, however, commercial\nrelations between Iran and the United\nStates were restricted by U.S. sanc-tions. Sanctions originally imposed in\n1995 by President Clinton (independ-ent of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities) have\nbeen continually renewed by President\nBush, citing the \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat\u201d to U.S. national security\nposed by Iran.\nIn early 2002, during his first State\nof the Union address, U.S. President\nGeorge W. Bush said that Iran, Iraq,\nand North Korea were part of an \u201caxis\nof evil.\u201d \u201cIran aggressively pursues\nthese weapons and exports terror,\nwhile an unelected few repress the Iranian people\u2019s hope for freedom.\u201d\nDespite the US National Intelligence\nEstimate and the most recent reports\nfrom the International Atomic Energy\nAgency confirming Iran does not have\na nuclear weapon program underway,\nthe U.S and Israel are still pursuing\ntheir efforts on declaring another war,\nthis time against Iran.\nOn March 20 2003 the U.S. and\nBritain, along with other countries,\nlaunched a military invasion \u201cto disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruc-tion, end Saddam Hussein\u2019s support\nfor terrorism, and to free the Iraqi\npeople.\u201d\nIf all of the above sounds frighteningly familiar with all the recent\nrhetoric coming from the same cast of\ncharacters regarding Iran, it\u2019s only because it is \u2013 the same tone and twisted\nreasoning and presumptions that were\nused to prop Iraq into the kind of serious threat it was made out to be.\nThe devastation and loss of innocent life suffered in Iraq would surely\nbe surpassed in an attack on Iran. In\naddition to the massive humanitarian\ncost, it would also destroy any developing democratic movements in the\ncountry.\n1,200 delegates from the global antiwar movement agreed to a worldwide\nco-ordinated demonstration calling\nfor all troops to leave Iraq and Afghanistan, and for there to be no attack on\nIran.\nThe 2003 demonstration played a\ncrucial role in halting talk of invading\nIran.\nWe keep marching and protesting\nbecause the policies of mass murder\nand devastation are opposed by the\nvast majority of people. It is why on\nSaturday 15 March, a national demonstration in London has been organised\nas part of the worldwide day of protest\nagainst George Bush\u2019s wars on the fifth\nanniversary of the Iraq invasion.\nIran, the United States and the Conflict\nSafa Shoaee\nMetal legends *cough*, System Of A Down, are actually Armenian. No joke\n\u201c\nAnyone\nwho has played\nRome: Total\nWar knows how\nmuch Armenia\nkicked ancient\nass\n8 felix Friday 7 March 2008\n\n"

This\nwould be a good choice for people who\ndon\u2019t always have much patience with\nart, or budding art-lovers \u2013 in addition,\nof course, to life-long art fanatics like\nme.\nThe Duchamp, Man Ray and\nPicabia exhibition runs from 21st\nFebruary \u2013 26th May 2008 at the\nTate Modern on level 4. Students\nget in for \u00a39\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFriday 7 March 2008 felix\nArts\nMan Ray\u2019s \u201cUntitled (Aerograph)\u201d\nis rather nice. He uses an airbrush to\ncreate a fine haze blurring into itself to\nproduce shape and depth. He describes\nthe technique as \u201ca purely cerebral activity\u201d because it allows the artist to\npaint without ever touching the can-vas. Another point to Man Ray!\nPicabia\u2019s definitely the most sexual\nof the three. \u201cAd libitum; Your Choice;\nAt Will\u201d is clearly sexual in some way,\nwith its bulbous pink shapes, but I\u2019m\nnot sure what exactly it\u2019s supposed to\nrepresent. It\u2019s like he knows what we\u2019re\nthinking and he\u2019s playing with our dirty\nlittle minds.\nRoom four I like very much. Picabia\nwins me back with his \u201cMechanomorphic Drawings\u201d which are just the sort\nof thing I adore at these exhibitions.\nBlack inked line and shapes with letters and words twisting around them.\nThey\u2019re glorified doodles of the kind\nI spend my younger teenage years\nproducing. Picabia\u2019s \u201cDaughter Born\nWithout Mother\u201d, a crisp and technical painting of a machine, is pleasing. I\ncan\u2019t really say why. Perhaps the green\ncolour on the dull, muddy brown back-ground, or the use of paint to create\nshadow, or just the technical precision\nof the line.\nI\u2019m put off Man Ray when I discover\nhis fondness for cross-dressing. He\ncreated the female alter ego Rose Selavy, who carried on working when he\ngot pissed off with the art community\nand went a bit underground. The photographs of him/her are amusing. He\nmakes an oddly good lady. In the same\nroom (five) there is a photo of Duchamp with a star shaved into his head.\nThe caption thingy says \u201cno-one knows\nexactly why Duchamp shaved his hair\nin this way\u201d. Apparently Picabia said:\n\u201cHe had had a special cut and had had\ndone it totally for himself \u2013 and a little\nfor me too. It amused us both\u201d. Right,\nwell, that explains it. Another example\nof the quirky fun these three artists had\ntogether.\nIn room six one of my exhibition\nhighlights is \u201cLa Voliere\u201d by Man Ray.\nHe\u2019s using the airbrush again and he\ndoes it beautifully, contrasting the soft,\nfading colours with the sharp black\nlines of the frame of a mannequin.\nThis definitely wins the award for\n\u2018Piece In The Exhibition That Emily\nWould Sneak Into Her Handbag If She\nThought She Could Get Away With It\u2019.\nMy birthday\u2019s coming up, so perhaps\nsome of you could chip in?\nRoom seven is Tate\u2019s favourite.\nThey\u2019ve been all arty and clever hanging sculpture from the ceiling to create\nshadows on the wall. They do looked\ndamned good. Shadows are not something you usually notice in exhibitions,\nand they can almost be better than the\nart casting them. Duchamp\u2019s famous\nurinal is in this room. In the context of\nthe exhibition, you wonder why it\u2019s so\niconic. Most of Duchamp\u2019s work is very\ndifferent, and arguably much better.\nTate fuels this misconception by using\nit to advertise the exhibition, which is a\nshame. Of course, this is only a replica,\nand there are others like it elsewhere. I\nthink it\u2019s important not to forget that.\nDuchamp\u2019s spinning discs (\u201cRotorliefs\u201d) in room eight are wonderful.\nColourful and hypnotic, producing\nswirling patterns. One features a gold-fish. They seem out of place, like Tate\nbought them from Habitat and are now\ntrying to trick us into believing they\u2019re\nart. They seem far too modern, but\nwere created in 1935. Picabia\u2019s \u201cConversation I\u201d is a creative use of naked\nbodies. They\u2019re splashed with colour\nand dotted about on a black and white\nstriped background, like classical statues falling into a black hole.\nI\u2019m always disappointed by how art\nexhibitions tend to end on a low. Picabia evidently went mental with boobs\nand dingy colours. \u201cMinos\u201d, a jumbled\njuxtaposition of naked forms, wildlife\nand faces, in a lot of brown, is a good\nrepresentation of the kind of art I de-spise. \u201cTransparency\u201d, also by Picabia,\nis an ugly, angry-looking naked woman being molested by a giant pair of\nhands. Ugh. Duchamp\u2019s \u201cL.H.O.O.Q.\u201d\nwill no doubt sell a lot of postcards. It\u2019s\nthe Mona Lisa with a moustache and\ngoatee. I\u2019m not exactly inspired. Apparently if you read the title out the\nFrench way, it sounds like the French\n\u201celle a chaud au cul\u201d = \u201cshe has a hot\narse\u201d. Well, yippee. An artistic triumph\nthere, Duchamp. On the bright side,\nthe wooden chess sets made by Duchamps and Man Ray are lovely. I\u2019d like\nto be able to hold the smooth carved\nwood pieces and possibly steal one as a\nsouvenir (again, one for the handbag).\nThe last room, \u201cEroticism\u201d, is just an\norgy of raw nudity, and I\u2019m not in the\nmood. The exhibition lost me here,\nand I couldn\u2019t be bothered to pay attention anymore. Picabia, dirty-mind-ed old fart that he is, should go away\nnow please.\nOverall the exhibition is excellent.\nThe content, layout and information\nare all of the high standard we expect\nfrom Tate. One small gripe I will add\nis that there is no seating, which pisses\nme off almightily. It\u2019s a fair effort slowly walking round these rooms, and I\nwould have appreciated the occasional\nbreak. It\u2019s nice to be able to sit down\nand admire the art from a distance,\nand maybe do a little people-watching.\nIt\u2019s also particularly annoying having\nto stand up when you\u2019re trying to take\nnotes to write an article! The exhibition benefits from having a wide range\nCinq Femmes 1941-43, Francois Picabia. Dirty bugger. Oil on canvas by the way\n\n"

Partly (well, mostly) because \u00a350 would\nmean that I would be able to just afford\na small lunch for one in a South Kensington caf\u00e9; but also because I greatly\nenjoy Felix; it\u2019s a brilliant rag full of\nwitty, thought-provoking opinion that\nit doesn\u2019t attempt to pass off as fact\n(but more on that later) and because I\ntoo enjoy writing. It\u2019s like listening to\nthe sound of your own voice, but you\ncan hear it again and again and again.\nUnfortunately, the last thing I ever\nwrote was my UCAS personal state-mentapplicationforthephysicsdepart-ment. Whether or not it is indicative of\nthe quality of my personal statement, I\nam now a first year materials student.\nTherefore I\u2019m going to keep my first\n(last?) article on something simple.\nAnti-Zionism in the BBC\nSo... Anti-Zionism in the BBC.\nI know this is Imperial; I assure you\nthat I haven\u2019t just fallen off the back of\nthe SOAS bus, and for the sci-fi society\nI\u2019m not talking about the matrix either,\nbut dear God the sheer anti-Israeli sentiment in this country\u2019s leading news\nsource really, really disturbs me.\nI would also like to declare a certain\nlevel of neutrality. Despite a large nose\nand indominitably curly sideburns, I\nam neither Jewish nor strictly Arabic,\nbut I take a keener than usual interest\nin the events of the Middle East; and\nlike most people in Britain, I have a certain indoctrinated trust for the beeb as\nour media outlet. We (supposedly) pay\nour TV license fee, and in return we\nhave a news source free of \u201cthe man,\u201d\nwith his giant dildo of TV ratings and\ncommercial revenue, anally raping all\nthe innocent journalists who just want\nto tell the truth.\nHowever, the BBC in my personal\nopinion is very anti-Zionist. The real\nclincher for me was an article reporting\non a rocket attack that killed a group of\nIsraeli citizens in the town of Sderot\n\u201crare.\u201d I mean, come on! It\u2019s rare that\nnuns get stabbed to death by drugged\nup tweenagers on the District Line to\nPutney Bridge; but when it happens,\neven the fairly level-headed BBC bray\nabout how this is indicative of the uncontrollable yoof of today.\nOne thing I am not faulting the BBC\non is their reporting of the fairly outrageous treatment that the Israelis are\ngiving the Palestinians. Not every resident of Gaza city is a militant member\nof Hamas, or every street vendor a gun\nrunner. However the BBC give the\nrhetoric spewed out by the right-wing\nnationalist nut job Israeli generals and\npoliticians substantially more column\nspace than the rhetoric spewed out by\nthe right-wing nationalist nut-job Palestinians; painting the image that the\nIsraelis are solely devoted to complete\nconquest of the world, while the Palestinians are the unsung heroes, protecting us from their curly side-burned\nrampage.\nNeither of which are true. Extremists on both sides are trying to extend\ntheir sphere of influence and protect\ntheir own supply lines. The Israelis\nhave more money and resources so\nstrike from the heavens like the hand\nof God, whereas the Palestinians have\nflexibility and clandestine backing so\ncan cause public destruction with no\nwarning.\nI suppose it is possibly this underdog\nnature that gives the Palestinians the\nedge in the British media. But this article isn\u2019t about the British media in gen-eral: I\u2019d expect populist flower-holding\ngirly men like the Independent to display opinion drenched vitriol as frontpage fact. But from the BBC, our BBC,\na lack of balance is deeply upsetting.\nAngry Geek Idol ends here. Take it away Gilead!\nKid A Geek\nA\nlecturer of mine is in the\nhabit of starting each\nhour off with a \u2018quote of\nthe day\u2019, to contribute\nsomething more than\nequations and theory to our general\neducation. Personally, I think this is a\nterrific idea. The reason I bring this up\nis because, at some point last week, he\nread off an extract from Ian McEwan\u2019s\nAtonement. I saw no point in copying\nit down because I\u2019ve acquired this 21st\nCentury confidence that absolutely\nanything worth finding can be found\nthrough a little refined Google search-ing. Not so. I\u2019ve spent most of the last\nArt and Science \u2013 in brief\nhour vainly trying to find this quota-tion, and I\u2019m now forced to mangle it\nfrom memory.\nThe award-winning English novelist\nreferred to modern artists and their\nalmost wilful ignorance of scientific\nadvances. Donne or Shakespeare, he\ninsists, would have raided quantum\ntheory or relativity for metaphors to\nuse in their own work, and rightly so.\nCurrently, however, it seems to be a\nmatter of pride for humanists to know\nnothing about science.\nI don\u2019t have enough experience to be\nable to confirm this view for myself, but\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this\nwere the case. Ever since Keats blamed\nNewton for \u2018unweaving the rainbow\u2019\nby explaining the physics behind it,\nartists have tended to look at science\nas being rather crude and earthy; as\nopposed to the exalted planes of existence on which they dwell. One of my\nfavourite quotations by Richard Feynman, which I carry around in my wallet\nat all times, asks: \u201cwhat men are poets\nwho can speak of Jupiter if he were a\nman, but if he is an immense spinning\nsphere of methane and ammonia must\nbe silent?\u201d But I\u2019m getting distracted.\nWhereas artists do often look down\non science, I find that this cannot compare with the disdain scientists sometimes have for artists. My problem\nwith this state of affairs, though, is that\nwhereas the former can be set down\nto lack of technical understanding, the\nlatter is due to sheer arrogance and a\nmisplaced feeling of superiority. Students of science are immensely lucky\nin that our horizons are as unbounded\nas possible. While a historian or a philosopher can never acquire more than\na passing familiarity with most scienc-es, a physicist or a mathematician can\nhave breathtaking scope in any artistic\nfield. This point was driven home to\nme very forcefully when I discovered\nthat both my history teacher and my\nEnglish teacher at school had taken\nundergraduate degrees in physics.\nIt was this realization, more than almost anything else, that drove me to\napply here. I can\u2019t claim to have any\nhistoric or literary pretensions \u2013 as my\npaltry Felix output demonstrates \u2013 but\nI certainly have a tremendous interest\nin the humanities. While Imperial is\nsomewhat lacking in its ability to cater\nto these interests, I can indulge in them\nto my heart\u2019s content in my spare time.\nWhile I can learn significant quantities\nabout Churchill, say, or Orwell or the\nHistory of Science by occasional read-ing, none of my arts friends can hope\nto learn about basic mechanics or electromagnetism without substantially\nmore effort.\nThis is what I mean about scientists\nhaving a substantial advantage. By\nour very nature we are supposed to\nbe curious people \u2013 eager to find out\nmore, to know more, to discover more\nin all directions. This is why scientists\nthroughout history have acquired a\nreputation for breadth of knowledge\noutside the hard sciences.\nThis is the ideal situation. There are\ndrawbacks, however. Whereas a student who spends years studying history or English is going to end up with\na substantial amount of general knowledge \u2013 whether they like it or not \u2013 by\ndint of reading, of listening, and of regurgitation or analysis, there is no such\nrequirement for a scientist. An MSc is\nperfectly capable of knowing nothing\nmore than the theory and practice of\ntheir particular field. Scientists have\nthe potential to be better-rounded\nthan almost anybody else, yet by the\nsame token they can also be the most\ndeeply ignorant.\nIt is this aspect of Imperial that annoys me the most. The fact that the\nperson behind me in lectures can ask\nwho Oscar Wilde was, or that an overheard conversation about Groucho\nMarx can contain the incredible line:\n\u201cany relation to Karl?\u201d is deeply frus-trating. I really don\u2019t mean to sound\nsnobbish, and I apologise if I come\nacross as such; but we are supposed to\nbe the representatives of our fields.\nMore than any other university in\nthe English-speaking world, we are\nsupposed to be the leading students of\nthe sciences. What sort of image do we\ngive by isolating ourselves in our scientific cocoon, however vast it may be?\nWhat does it say about us that we have\nno thought for the immense riches\neasily within our grasp if we just cared\nenough to try and collect them?\nThis is as upset as you\u2019ll see me get,\nI think, because this really is what irritates me the most. That scientists,\nwho have such tremendous potential\nas polymaths, whose curiosity should\nbe second to none, who have always\nenjoyed a reputation for being particularly cultured, should settle into\nthese stereotypes that are all too easy\nto break.\nGilead Amit\n\n"
