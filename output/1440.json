    "content": "10 felix FRIDAY 16 OCTOBER 2009\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCOMMENT\nJaimie Henry:UncleJaimieisdying.Soareyou.\n\u201cAt the moment, I\nam on placement\nas a mushroom (i.e.\nkept in the dark and\nshat on) at a district\ngeneral hospital\u201d\nI\nt\u2019s true. Admittedly not as acutely\nas the opening gambit makes out,\nbut you, I, the rector, Noel Edmonds \u2013 we\u2019re all dying.\nAs depressing as such a sentence may be, I fear that as time marches on and the fresher\u2019s fortnight draws\nto a gentle close, the harsh reality of age\nwon\u2019t become apparent to you young\nwhippersnappers until it\u2019s too late. It\ndidn\u2019t for me; it crept up on me in the\nsame way I imagine David Cameron\ncreeps up on the souls of the damned\n\u2013 cunningly and with a little too much\nslime for my liking. Woo, go satire.\nButIdigress.Thiswholearticleprobably\nseemsalittleodd,butinanattempttogive\nit some direction I shall take you back to\nlast December, when my ex-girlfriend was\ncontemplating her 20th birthday. Birthdays should be a happy affair, or at least\nthey always have been for me: presents\nand general sycophancy up until one hits\nthe tender age of 15, when this is happily\nreplaced by the slow descent into alcoholism and the ignorance of basic contracep-tion. For the ex, however, this seemed to\nhave been replaced by a wistful look and\na general malaise about the whole thing.\nShe was \u201cno longer a teenager,\u201d and despite my protests that she had been a legal adult for almost two years none of my\ncharm could make her see that I was right\nand she should enjoy the excuse for mega-lash. She said she \u201cfelt old.\u201d Up until this\nevening, I had put this down to the fact\nthat she was an interminably miserable\nold bitch. Now I realise that, shockingly\nfor her, she was right. 20 is old.\nAt the moment, I am on placement as\na mushroom (i.e. kept in the dark and\nshat on) at a district general hospital\nabout half an hour outside London. This\nhas its frustrations as we all desperately\nfight over who gets to stick a patient\nwith a needle, so in an attempt to blow\noff some steam I took a run along the\nriver. Then it hit me; I am old as well.\nMy fat beetroot of a face, desperately\ngasping for air, had become drenched in\na bottle of Evian water \u2013 mockingly telling me to \u201clive young.\u201d I was listening to\n\u201cMack the Knife\u201d; not The Prodigy, not\nN-dubz or whatever his name is \u2013 I was\nlistening to Sinatra and company tell\nme that I should fly to the moon. The\nother day Celine Dion found her way\nonto my Spotify playlist. God save me.\nThe more I do think about it however,\nmy friends and I are all the same. We\nstay in and watch shit movies instead of\ngoing out to the cinema; we don\u2019t go to\nthe fresher\u2019s events because their youthful exuberance is annoying and they\nweren\u2019t as hardcore as we were back\nin the day; and perhaps worst of all we\nhave all started sitting around a dining\ntable drinking copious amounts of reasonably priced red wine. As such, when\none wakes up fully clothed on one\u2019s bed,\nblue lips and contact lenses still in with\nnothing but sore eyes and a somewhat\nfruitless morning glory tucked somewhere it really shouldn\u2019t be, perhaps it\nis time to take action.\nSo to what end has this article been?\nTake it as a warning, children. For you\nshould go out and get hammered and\nattempt to sleep with the girl you\u2019re\nfacebook stalking. You should try eating jalapenos off a Swedish volleyball\nteam. Definitely make spurious business decisions based on the fact that\nyou\u2019re shouting \u201cThe FTSE\u2019s on its arse\nagain!\u201d without actually knowing what\nthe difference between the FTSE and\nyour arse is. For at the end of it all, being\na mushroom has taught me one thing:\ndeath is nothing but a horrifically polite\nnonchalance at the morning medical\nhandover. Now, hopefully \u201cMr Henry...\nerr, up on Ward B4...no, sorry, passed\naway,\u201d might just become \u201cThat rich\nfuckwit drunken sex-maniac pimp Mr\nHenry has finally croaked. Old bastard.\u201d\nGilead Amit gets a kick out of a dry spell...\n\u201cAll those who\nconsider the BNP a\nviable option could\nbe housed and\nbedded in Norfolk\nand quietly cast adrift\nin the North Sea\u201d\nT\ntimes live we in turbulent.\nUncertain standards are,\ncompasses are spinning\nmoral, and even trusted can\u2019t\nbe sentences properly to be\nconstructed. Situation the political in\ncountry this testament unfortunate bears\nto, as noticed I am sure of you have many.\nWhenever the whirlwinds of economic hardship blow across the electoral\nseas, the ship of state veers dangerously\nto the right and metaphors are blown\nabout like chocolate wrappers whipped\nout of the hands of careless pleasure\ncruisers. The past few years have proven\nno exception to that rule. To usurp the\ntelevangelists\u2019 privilege of combining\narrogance with disregard for scripture,\nthese have been years that the low-classed hath eaten.\nThe British National Party has seen a\nsignificant and alarming rise in its membership in recent years, with counts estimating their total number of voters\nto be over 900,000. To put this in its\nproper perspective, all men and women\nof voting age who consider the BNP a\nreasonable alternative to the bipartisan\nnightmare could be comfortably housed\nand bedded in Norfolk and quietly cast\nadrift in the North Sea. Until the good\nfolk of Norfolk agree to open their gates\nto such an influx of potentially violent\nand uneducated immigrants, however,\nthe country at large will have to reconcile itself to hearing the same tiresome\nintolerant and intolerable remarks.\nFortunately the British Naturalist Party seems keen to provide employment\nfor an entire generation of foreigners, as\ntheir policies and actions have provided\nenough material for countless naturalised citizens to embark on profitable\ncareers in stand-up comedy. On a more\nintimate scale, though, the Banque Nationale de Paris succeeds in getting poor\nbastards such as myself into awkward\nsocial situations.\nBellowing out things you don\u2019t believe\nwhile performing demented hand gestures and peculiar facial contractions is\nnot something any sane person would\ndo on a regular basis. It might, for one\nthing, get them mistaken for a politician.\nBut when the above contortions are\ndone for comic effect, the average man\non the street may be permitted a temporary spell of lunacy if he refers to it as\nsarcasm. Those of us with loftier aspirations are permitted even greater sins by\nvirtue of vague references to irony.\nOr at least, so I believed. And that\nwas the reason I permitted myself, on\na number of occasions throughout the\npast year, to loudly proclaim: \u2018Lousy immigrants \u2013 coming over here and taking\nour jobs!\u2019 within earshot of passers-by.\nThe truly ironic (ha ha) aspect of the\nwhole situation (tee hee) is that (oh, let\nme wipe my eyes) I myself (please stop,\nlet me catch my breath) am foreign.\nThe trouble is, of course, that there\nis no convenient way to identify non-citizenship of a given country. There is\nno un-ID card or anti-passport distributed to the billions of us who would\nfind it convenient to prove our lack of\nBritish affiliation. The difficulty is compounded by the unusual and irritating\nEnglish accent I seem to have picked\nup from God-knows-where, and the\npronounced pallor of my skin. In fact,\nif the latest in a series of reports by Dr.\nBernard Lamb is to be trusted (see page\n3), the only reliable distinguishing mark\nwould be the quality of my English. According to Dr. Lamb, a former reader in\nGenetics at Imperial College, those of\nyou whose feet in ancient times walked\nupon England\u2019s mountains green make\non average five times as many errors in\nwritten English as the rest of us. In other\nwords, it takes the combined effort of\nfive foreigners to write as badly as any\none Englishman. You should be proud.\nOr could that be prowed?\nThe lack of respect the English have\nfor their own language is something\nof a mystery. It could be the result of a\nblithe, devil-may-care insouciance or\ntheir keenly developed sense of irony.\nWhatever the reasons, the deteriorating\nlevel of written English among students\nis cause for concern. You may see this\nas flying close to the hot, gaseous winds\nof pedantry, but I beg to differ. There is\nnothing wrong with labor, neighbors, or,\nindeed, with criticizing medieval theater programs. It is as ludicrous to judge\nsomeone on their colour as it is on the\nbasis of their spelling of color, and the\ngrowing prejudice against American\nspelling is indicative of the worst kind\nof narrow-minded parochialism. Language evolves, and that is good. But laziness and ignorance, though inevitable,\nare bad. To paraphrase Dr. Lamb, emaciated seamen are not the same as emasculated seamen, and semen is a different\nkettle of fish altogether. Or a different\nkettle of fish, all together.\nStandards and values are paternalistic\nand disgusting words to use, granted;\nbut let\u2019s face it, standerds and valews are\neven worse.\n\n"

However, ICSMSU\u2019s events\nare Freshers\u2019 Fortnights are notorious for attracting students from years\nthroughout the medical school. ICSMSU described Wednesday\u2019s event as\n\u201cone of the biggest nights of the fortnight with the whole medschool turning out in scrubs and nurses outfits for\na pub crawl through Hammersmith\u201d\non their website.\nThe 3rd year student, who has been\nunnamed, was said not to be officially\nat the event, but had joined in with\nthe night\u2019s proceedings anyway. The\nsituation apparently escalated on the\nstreet outside the Shepherds Bush\nRoad venue when he reportedly became aggressive towards a number of\npeople, which included a police officer.\nRumours circulating College suggest\nthat the officer in question was plain-clothed at the time. It seems a likely\nconcept as the Fire Station bar is merely down the road from the Hammersmith Police Station. Students in the\nimmediate area said there was a \u201cheavy\npolice presence\u201d after events unfolded.\nThe ICSMSU\u2019s statement was cagey\nand ambiguous about the events.\n\u201cThis is a great shame.

Whether it is because it reaffirms boasts of\nbeing here or because it downplays the\ncost of not getting into Oxbridge, we\nall love the Times World University\nRankings. If you are happy to ignore\ninternational recognition in favour of\nthe other mark of quality \u2013 the Times\nis British whereas Shanghai is Chinese\n\u2013 then the rankings usually make for\nself-affirming reading.\nThis year there has been a mixed\nblessing. Imperial has climbed up\nfrom sixth to fifth place but UCL has\njumped ahead to fourth. With our own\nrivalry aside, UCL outperforming MIT\ndemands a second look at the num-bers. The Times uses six measures to\ncompose their overall rankings. Two of\nthese are relevant and objective. One\nis specifically staff/student ratio, as\nopposed to any measure of staff time\nspent on students, which explains Imperial doing reasonably well. The other\nis the claimed cause of that problem,\nthe staff/citation score.\nSadly this is not listed as Imperial\u2019s\nstrong suit. Aside from a few amusing\nnotes, such as Caltech graduates being\nexceptionally disliked by their future\nbosses, the peer and employer reviews\nall offer near full marks.\nThe last two components of the\noverall score clear up the confusion\nnicely. A full third of the marks are directly based on the internationality of\nstaff and students.\nThis as an independent parameter\nis particularly lucky for Imperial given\nhow many of the marks from the other\nmeasures also probably come from this\nsource. Needless to say, Imperial score\nthe highest in the top ten for both.\nThis also essentially clears up the UCL\npuzzle.\nDan Wan\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief\nSinaAtaherian\nSinaAtaherian Business Editor\n1.

    "content": "20 felix FRIDAY 16 OCTOBER 2009\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nQuick-start culture list\nVictoria & Albert Museum\n(V&A):\nThis museum houses a collection of art and design from\naround the world, including\nlife-size architectural casts\nfrom Italy, Chinese textiles\nand Japanese swords. The\nNational Art Library can be\nfound here, but if you prefer\nsome time out from a studious environment the fountains in the central courtyard\nare ideal for more reflective\nmoments. South Kensington\nScience Museum: (above)\nSituated right near the heart\nof Imperial, you cannot fail\nto miss this brilliant and fascinating monolith of heritage\nand groundbreaking technol-ogy. Tours, interactive exhibits and even a \u2018Night at the\nScience Museum\u2019 where you\ncan hang out with friends\nafter-hours (for purely educational purpose only). South\nKensington\nNatural History Museum:\n(right)\nYou cannot have missed this\nbeaut of a building on approaching Imperial from\nSouth Ken tube. This museum is a joy to wander round,\nrenowned for its Dinsosaur\ncollection but also housing\nsections on every area of\nnatural history imaginable:\ninsects, plants, geology, as-tronomy, human biology\u2026\nEntry is free although entry\nto the temporary exhibitions\ncosts 4GBP for students. Expect large groups of school\nchildren at any time.\nSouth Kensington\nTate Britain: (below right)\nA more grown up version\nof its south bank cousin, the\nTate Modern, the Britain is\nanother spectacular building\ninside with endless ceilings\nand cool marble interiors.\nThere is a large amount of\n\u2018older\u2019 art to work through although the temporary hangings often feature modern\nartists. Entry is free for most\nof the museum, although\nsome of the non-permanent\nexhibitions require an entry\nfee. Pimlico\nTate Modern:\nYet another architectural\nachievement that requires no\nentry fee. Expect only modern art here with most floors\nbeing permanent collections\nthat are \u2018re-hung\u2019 once a year.\nFloors 3 and 5 were rehung\nin May and are definitely\nworth a visit (includes Andy\nWarhol).\nSouthwark or Mansion House\nNational Gallery:\nThis giant spans one side of\nTrafalgar square and contains work from some of\nBritain\u2019s greatest painters.\nLike most of the large London museums, entry fee is\nonly required for the temporary exhibitions. The NG\ncaf\u00e9 serves some scrumptious fare to boost the energy\nrequired for making it round\nthis museum in good spirits.\nCharing Cross\nBritish Museum:\nContaining all the products\nof the British Empire\u2019s pillaging efforts over the last\nfour centuries\u2026 Think weird\nmasks, Egyptian mummies\nand a lot more. Again, the\nmuseum is worth visiting to\nmarvel at the marble and its\nconstruction. Catch it before\neverything is returned to\ntheir rightful owners! Don\u2019t\nmiss this one if you want to\nsubmerge yourself in history\nitself.\nRussell Square\nCartoon Museum:\nTwo minutes from the British Museum, this is located\nin a very lovely part of town.\nThe curator of the museum\nproduces brilliant shows, always excellently researched\nand teeming with information for the less informed.\nAs well as their exhibition\nspace, the museum has a well\nstocked shop and is a must\nfor anyone into their comic\nstrips and graphic novels.\nNearby there is also an even\nlarger, better stocked graphic\nnovel shop.\nRussell Square\nPolitical Cartoon Gallery:\nAn easy one to miss, this tiny\ngallery has a shabby, informal\ncharm to it with a mural on\nthe wall downstairs by some\ncartoonists. Here you will see\nthe satirical works of artists\nwho contribute to the comment and editorial sections\nof everything from the FT,\nEconomist, Times, Guardian\net al.\nTottenham Court Road\nCamden Arts Centre:\nNot in Camden, per se, but\na haven for art you wouldn\u2019t\nhear of normally. It has a\nreading room, book shop,\nexcellent caf\u00e9 and a gorgeous\ngarden to relax in set above\nthe hubbub of the main road.\nPerfect for a quite day out\nwith a loved one\nFinchley Road\nProud Gallery:\nDefinitely in Camden, the\nProud gallery kills three\nbirds with one stone: gallery\nspace, music venue and the\none most original unusual\nbars in London. Once a horses stable, the cobbled floor\nand roughly painted white\nwalls still remain which are\nadorned with mainly photographic collections of a musical nature. Past exhibitions\nhave included Blues Greats,\nBob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix\nand the current Woodstock\ncollection.\nCamden Town\nSerpentine Gallery:\nAnother small, simple gallery\nwhich hovers on the edge of\nKensington Gardens. It is always free and quick to walk\naround (bite sized, perfect\nfor a lunch break) and the\nexhibitions have never failed\nto please. Jeff Koons is presently on display and his signature kitsch kiddy-porno\nstyle is easy on both the eyes\nand brain.\nSouth Kensington\nWallace Collection:\nThis out of the way collection is not to be missed \u2013\nhome to some of the most\nostentatious and \u2018frou-frou\u2019\npaintings of the French Rococo and Baroque periods,\nas well as some fine examples of Dutch genre and still-life painting \u2013 it is housed in\na beautiful period building.\nTry to resist touching the\nwallpaper though. The restaurant is excellent and entrance to the gallery is free of\ncharge. Bond Street or Baker\nStreet\nICA:\nLocated in The Mall, home\nto old money and classic\ngrandeur, the Institute of\nContemporary Arts is perhaps an anomaly but is such\na treat to visit. Housing a cin-ema, a theatre, a bar/caf\u00e9 and\na gallery this really is an ideal\nplace to come on any day (or\nnight) of the week for fun.\nThe bands and DJs that play\nhere are always excellent and\nI don\u2019t think there are many\nplaces in London where one\ncan swig whisky, listen to folk\n(or otherwise) within stumbling distance of Buckingham Palace.\nCharing Cross\nSmall and\nQuirky\nThe Big Ones\n\n"

The boat was sent to\nemergency intensive care, placed on an\nIV drip and repaired, but was a source\nof worry for the lightweight sculler.\nThe German saboteur is now on the\nrun after making outrageous claims\nabout GB Coach Steve Trapmore trying to de-rig the GER heavyweight\nmen\u2019s 8+ the night before the final, in\nwhich they later won.\nGerman press has suggested coaches were unwilling to take a chance on\nFreeman-Pask becoming a distraction\nfor IC\u2019s Ole Tietz before the race; it\nis thought Tietz was consumed with\nmaking headlines on the club website\nand receiving more hits than FreemanPask articles had previously recorded.\nFreeman-Pask finished second in the\nfirst two opening rounds (07:13.14,\n07:36.23), behind the Netherlands and\nIraq respectively. Freeman-Pask was\nunable to make a top three position in\nthe semifinal to qualify for the A final,\nbut finished second in the B final. This\ntakes his world ranking from last years\n13th place to 8th.\nIn the opening heat of the men\u2019s\nlightweight 8+ Germany (Tietz) mirrored Freeman-Pask\u2019s opening round\nand took second place. With fewer\ncompetitors than the single sculls\nevent this directly qualified the eight\ninto the A final. With tough competition the Germans struggled to get into\nmedal contention and finished 6th in\n05:43.40; ten seconds behind the Italian winners.\nDespite the GB-GER tensions between Freeman-Pask and Tietz, both\ncountries ended up top of the medals\ntable allowing ill feelings between the\nIC lightweights to dissipate. [Note:\nSince publication of this article POD\nhas been made aware of the fact that although equal on medal count Germany took the FISA team trophy AHEAD\nof Great Britain. The source of this information must remain anonymous for\nlegal reasons, suffice to say dissipation\nof ill feelings may have been a premature statement.]\nImperial boasted two representatives on the GB coaching team: Steve\nTrapmore and Stuart Whitelaw.

    "content": "17\nfelix FRIDAY 16 OCTOBER 2009\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk BUSINESS\nA\nt last the likely post-May\n-elections Chancellor\nof the Exchequer has\nexplained in detail how\nhis government will begin to repay the record deficit. In a\nmuch-anticipated speech at last week\u2019s\nConservative Party Conference in\nManchester, George Osborne unveiled\nsome of the places where the axe will\nhave to fall.\nThis was always going to be a tough\nchoice. The polls have been shouting\nfor months that the voters want, above\nanything else, politicians to be honest and tell them how they plan to fix\nthe country\u2019s finances. Yet when John\nSmith tried this same tactic before the\n1992 general elections, it backfired\nspectacularly. Voters saying they want\nthe truth about cuts are often assumed\nto mean they would like someone else\u2019s\nservices and their own taxes to be cut.\nThe Conservatives have a very comfortable majority. This is due to the\nman who has worked tirelessly for the\nlast two years to make them electa-ble again: Gordon Brown. This was a\nvery risky move on their part. There\nwere many ways of saying almost what\nthey said, but in a useless and thus uncontroversial form.\nThere is a real danger of investors no\nlonger believing that the UK will remain able to respect its obligations for-ever, as has been universally assumed\nin the past. If bondholders refuse to\nallow the Treasury to continue rolling\nover its debt, there could be a serious\nspiralling effect. The lack of confidence can drive up the Government\u2019s\nborrowing costs, in turn making it less\nable to afford to make its repayments,\nfurther reducing confidence. The Tories decided that with their double-digit lead assured, they could gamble\non the electorate\u2019s maturity. The bond\nmarkets responded well.\nThe man until now dubbed by the\nCity \u201cBoy George\u201d for his less-than-impressive aura and clout unleashed\na string of proposed savings. Yet all\nthis amounts to only \u00a37bn a year, so it\nshould be taken only as a sign of things\nto come. Of course, political hindrances still abound; the Tories have had to\npromise not to make cuts to the NHS\u2019s\nhighly wasteful budget.\nThis must nonetheless be compared\nwith the alterative. Despite a desperate\ncabinet pleading with Brown to drop\nhis retarded comparison between \u2018Labour investment\u2019 and \u2018Tory Cuts\u2019, he\nstill introduced a massive array of new\ncommitments at his own party conference last month.\nIn a report published on Monday by\nthe Centre for Economics and Business\nResearch (CEBR), the Bank of England\nbase rate is predicted to remain at its\ncurrent near-all-time-low of 0.5% until 2011. The CEBR cannot see the rate\nreaching 2% until at least 2014. Normally, a report predicting the continuation of a destructive, fallaciously reasoned central planning decision for the\nforeseeable future would be cause for\nconcern. Not this time. For once, the\narbitrary whim of our central planners\nhas fallen on our side.\nThe report is considered a reasonably\nstrong guide to interest rate changes in\nthe near future. It will also predict the\npound weakening against the dollar,\nalthough this is more speculative. The\nauthors assume that the Government\nwill be able to cut \u00a380bn from spending whilst raising \u00a320bn more from\ntaxes. They believe this will be needed\nto save the country from spiralling interest rates on its sovereign bonds, as\ninvestors will lose confidence if nothing is done about the deficit.\nBased on this forecast, in a mixed\nprescription-prediction, typical of\nsuch reports, it advocates its own pro-jections. The authors assert that interest should be kept artificially low in\norder to appease the economy for our\nfailings as mortals to feed it with government spending. One could be forgiven for thinking at first that their logic corrects itself through their double\nblunder. In fact, they are condemning a\nuseful outcome of the recession \u2013 necessarily lower government spending\n\u2013 and then advocating a means of cancelling its benefits in the long run.\nCEBR chief executive Douglas\nMcWilliams has described this as \u201can\nexciting policy mix, with the fiscal\npolicy lever pulled right back while\nthe monetary lever is fast forward.\u201d His\nargument is essentially that after some\ntime investors will once again mistake\nnominal asset price rises for real increases in their value, which \u201cshould\nstimulate economic growth after a lag.\u201d\nIn years to come we will have every\nright to complain about the simultaneous debasement of currency and theft\nof our due interest that is central bank-ing. For now though, we should enjoy\npaying 0% interest on our own money\nthat Gordon Brown graciously chooses\nto loan back to us to cover the cost of\nuniversity. We cannot thank him for\nlower mortgage payments in a few\nyears time, since low interest is practically the sole reason for grossly overpriced housing. But there are plenty\nof other reasons for broke students to\nwant to borrow. They should be happy at the prediction of slightly lower\nrepayments.\nIn 1991 the Annals of Improbable Research began the Ig Nobel awards as a\nparody of the Nobel Prizes, to be given\nto ten achievements that \u201cfirst make\npeople laugh, and then make them\nthink.\u201d Over the years the futility of\ntheir efforts has become increasingly\nclear.\nOn Friday night I was ready to write\nan article about the farcical awarding\nof the Nobel Peace Prize to a man who\nhad only been President for twelve\ndays before the nomination deadline\nand had already escalated the US presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. I decided\nfor a similarly Orwellian decision to\nbe made for the Economics Prize on\nMonday, before wrapping up both issues into a broader attack on the Nobel committee and Scandinavians in\ngeneral.\nThen something strange happened.\nFor the first time in years, sane people\nwon the Economics Prize. The birther/\nNew World Order/Texan secessionist\nwebsites upon whom I rely as my primary news source and consider my intellectual home, were genuinely happy.\nDid this mean a balanced article was in\norder? Certainly not. The Nobies are\nafter all an award of $1.4 million that\noccasionally go to respectable people\nbut usually not. People do worse things\nand get paid more, so why does anyone\nget so offended? The best way to show\ndisapproval for the awards is to see\nthem for what they are, like Olympic\ngold medals for curling.\nLoans in Our Time\nThe Redundancy of Ig Nobel Prizes\nStrong Results for JP Morgan\nJPMorgan has announced third quarter\nprofits of \u00a32.5bn, beating predictions.\nThe results came despite losses on\ncredit cards and consumer loans because of excellent performance in the\ninvestment banking division, particularly in Fixed Income.\nChairman and CEO Jamie Dimon\nwarned that the cost of credit will\nlikely remain high \u201cfor the foreseeable\nfuture.\u201d\nThe bank repaid its $25 billion US\ngovernment rescue in June.\nJPMorgan said it had also benefited\nfrom its purchase of most Washington\nMutual assets, which it acquired in\nSeptember 2008.\nGoldman Sachs is expected to announce profits later in the week, whilst\nBank of America and Citigro up are expected to post losses.\nGood news for Goldman Sachs.\nBrief News\nFewer More Job Losses\nAccording to the latest government\n\u201cstatistics\u201d we should all rejoice because by Gordon\u2019s grace, unemployment is increasing slightly less fast\nthan it was expected to.\nChina invests \u00a34.5 bn in Guinea\nThis is controversial because Captain\nCamara\u2019s government is meant to be\nless legitimate than most others. I suspect he was at least born in Guinea.\nGeorge Osborne\nAmericans spend slightly less\nThe end of the Cash for Clunkers programme has led to a 10.4% drop in\ncar sales. This led retail sales to their\nsharpest fall for 2009, at 1.5%, less than\nexpected, so apparently good news.\nIn other news: Tory Conference, Nobel Prizes & more\nThe Annals Of Improbable Research\naward the Ig Nobel Prizes each year\n\n"

    "content": "15\nfelix FRIDAY 16 OCTOBER 2009\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk POLITICS\nShock over Nobel Peace Prize winner\nThe news surprised many, including\nthe President\u2019s own press secretary,\nwhose first reaction to the news was\na stunned \u201cWow\u201d. And although he\u2019s\nstill been unable to bag that quintessential yet elusive benchmark of lifetime achievement, an honorary degree\nfrom Arizona State University, Barack\nObama can now add a Nobel Peace\nPrize to his already impressive stack\nof extraordinary achievements (which,\nremember folks, already includes a\nGrammy).\nLet\u2019s put this in perspective; only\nthree US presidents before Obama\nhave won a Nobel Peace Prize in the\naward\u2019s history. And of them, two\n(Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow\nWilson) received the award before\nWorld War 2, and the third (Jimmy\nCarter) received the award long after\nhe had left office. So it surely must\nhave taken something pretty damn\nheroic for Obama to carry this prize\na mere 9 months into his presidency,\nright? Well, this is where it gets slightly\nconfusing. Because you see, he hasn\u2019t\ndone terribly much. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (despite saying he \u201cwasn\u2019t\nupset\u201d at Obama\u2019s award) hasn\u2019t suddenly seen the light. Tensions in the\nMiddle East are still arguably as high as\nthey were at the start of Obama\u2019s term.\nThe award comes as Obama ponders\nsending over an additional 20 to 40\nthousand more troops into Afghanistan, which ironically enough would\nmake this year\u2019s Peace Prize laureate a\nwar president.\nSo why did the Nobel Prize Committee settle on him for the award? The\nofficial reasons included his \u201cextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy\u201d, and the fact that he\nhas \u201ccaptured the world\u2019s attention and\ngiven its people hope for a better future\u201d. You\u2019ve got to figure it must have\nbeen a pretty slow year for peacemaking when the guy they give the award\nto gets it because of what he would like\nto do. Except it wasn\u2019t quite, was it?\nLet\u2019s have a look at others shortlisted\nfor this year\u2019s award. There\u2019s Morgan\nTsvangirai, Zimbabwe\u2019s Prime Minister, whose tireless efforts to preserve\nunity and hope in Africa\u2019s most disheartened country (not to mention under the world\u2019s worst boss) must surely\ndeserve some sort of accolade.\nThen there are Chinese dissidents\nsuch as Wei Jingsheng, who spent 17\nyears in a Chinese labour camp for\nencouraging reforms of the Chinese\nCommunist Party (CCP) and democracy and environmental activist Hu\nJia, who was sentenced to 3 and a half\nyears in jail last year for \u201csubversive activities\u201d, the label given to her attempts\nto publicize the plight of the persecuted Falun Gong minority.\nSurely by overlooking the struggles\nof these and other leaders, the Nobel\nPrize committee has committed the\ncrime of denying some of the world\u2019s\nmost oppressed people the publicity and public acknowledgement that\nthey crave, and indeed need. Can it\npossibly be fair to give the award to a\nman who is already the world\u2019s most\nfamous and widely loved leader? For\nno other reason than him wanting to\nachieve what he was expected to in\nthe first place?\nAnd yet there are those who argue\nthat to immediately dismiss this award\nas phony and cynical would be immature and pretentious. They argue that\nhaving surmounted impressive odds\nby becoming America\u2019s first AfricanAmerican president, Obama (and the\nAmerican people) have scored a major victory over the legacy of a scarred\nand painful past, and given the world\nAnthony Maina\nAnthony Maina\nThis year\u2019s surprise winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, President Obama, pledges the $1.4 million prize money to charity\na reason to believe in hope again. The\nplatform itself of Obama\u2019s election victory was the embrace of a multilateral\napproach to leadership that had been\nlong scorned and ridiculed as weak and\nineffectual by the serial democracy-mongers of the Bush administration.\nAnd one should not gloss over the\nfact that Obama took a stand against\nthe Iraq war at a time when it was risky\neven within his own party to do so. He\ncertainly has shown no small amount\nof intent to get the world to start talking again; his generous overtures to the\nArab world have been met with the\nrelief of a world weary of being forced\nto pick sides in George Bush\u2019s unhappy\nand destructive \u201cfor-or-against-us\u201d approach to geopolitics. He has opened\nthe door to talks with Iran over nuclear\naffairs, removing the precondition\nthat Iran first abandon enrichment of\nuranium. North-Korea has also been\ninvited to closer engagement with the\nWest, and Russia has been treated with\na warmth and respect neither imagined nor expected during the Bush administration\u2019s tenure.\nBut eloquent words, determined action and concrete results are quite distinctly different things. Ronald Reagan\nworked tirelessly to create a unified,\nfree and safe world, playing an important role in liberating Eastern Europe\nand articulating his vision of a world\nfree from nuclear weapons. Did he get\na Nobel for all his effort? No.\nWoodrow Wilson picked up a Nobel\nprize for his role in creating the League\nof Nations, a pursuit noble enough in\npurpose but which eventually created\na body now historically infamous for\nbeing ineffectual, dithering, and appeasing a dangerous regime, ultimately\nfailing to prevent the most devastating\nwar of the Modern Age.\nJimmy Carter, whose role in bringing\ntogether bitterly opposed Israeli and\nPalestinian sides culminated in the\ncelebrated Camp David accords, had\nto wait 22 years (and do a whole lot\nmore heavy lifting diplomacy-wise)\nafter leaving office to pick up the coveted award.\nMaybe it was, as some suggest, just\nanother finger in the eye of the Bush\nadministration; a thumbs up to the\nAmerican people for at last electing\nsomebody willing to adopt a style so\nradically different (in tone at least)\nto Mr Bush\u2019s. But this would seem\npetty, and in this writer\u2019s view highly\nunlikely.\nPerhaps the most important impact will come from the Obama administration\u2019s reaction to the award.\nThe president has not been slow to\nacknowledge that he had perhaps not\nyet earned the accolade, expressing\nhis feeling that he \u201c (did not ) deserve\nto be in the company of so many\ntransformative figures that have been\nhonoured by this prize\u201d.\nIn accepting this award, he must\nknow that he has set the bar pretty\nhigh for himself. A significant failure\nin international diplomacy or American foreign military involvement after having accepted this award could\npermanently tarnish a potentially\nmonumental legacy.\nMr Obama is famously inscrutable,\nsometimes leaving even his closest\nallies guessing at his inner motives.\nWhether he accepted the award\nin a fit of vanity or with an eye to a\ngrander design is something perhaps\nonly time will reveal. So too whether\ngiving the award to such an inexperienced president so early in his first\nterm was a prudent choice by the\nNorwegians.\nWant to write for Politics?

After about\nfive years of flooding,\nstorms and trenchfoot,\nthe Pilton faithful were\nrewarded with an absolute corker of a\nfestival, with the best line-up in years,\na couple of new fields and some real,\ngenuine sunshine (obligatory Thursday night monsoon notwithstanding).\nAfter much prevaricating, this year\nalso saw Mr Eavis et al. accept what\neveryone else there has known for\nyears.

Avoiding the crowds,\nwe checked out beatboxer extraordi-naire Beardyman in the Dance VilT\nhis summer I had the delight of attending Latitude\nFestival in Suffolk. Having never been before and\nnot knowing many of the\nartists performing, I approached the\nfestival with an open mind, bringing few expectations with me. As it\nMulticoloured sheep\nA lake\nA stage on the lake\nA forest\nSeveral stages in the forest\nNick Cave\nTasty tasty food\nEd Byrne\nRomanian gypsy music\nNo mud (it was sandy)\nFree yoghurt and cereal for breakfast\nOnly 40\u2019000 people\nFever Ray\nAdam (The Adam and Joe Show)\nNice souvenir cups\nFriendly security staff that ask you\nnicely not to break the rules.\nSean Lock\nThe Sonic Manipulator (google it)\nThom Yorke\nFree apples and pears (Cider Tent)\nJeffery Lewis singing silly songs\nDeck chairs\nJessica Delfino\nGood quality programs\nNo \u2018lets go fucking mental\u2019 chants\nso many music reviewers do) to try and\nconvey just how brilliant this festival\nwas, but I\u2019d rather not waste my time\nor yours with such ridiculously preten-tious, overly flamboyant, unnecessary\nand ultimately meaningless twaddle.\nThis festival was brilliant for so many\nreasons, but overall, it was simply\nthe friendly atmosphere and endless\namounts of brilliant and sometimes bizarre things to see and do, that made it\nsuch a wonderful and refreshing expe-turned out, Latitude Festival was the\nperfect place for this way of think-ing. Not a moment went by when I\nwas bored. The enormous selection\nof music, comedy, theatre, film, literary and poetry performances, plus\na huge number of interesting places\nto eat and drink, could have kept me\nbusy for a week (had I been given the\nopportunity).\nI could fill this review with reams of\nadjectives, metaphors and similes (as\nrience. These days, so many festivals\nfront a warm, fun, friendly atmosphere,\nwhich simply masks an uninviting, sor-did, surly, dark, dismal and somewhat\nmenacing weekend of drugs, violence\nand filth. In sterling contrast, Latitude\nis exactly what it says it is; a pleasant\nand welcoming weekend that provides\ngenuine, unadulterated and wholesome fun. I would recommend this\nfestival to everyone, regardless of their\ntaste in music and arts.\n26 reasons why\nLatitude Festival is\na \u2018must-go\u2019\nlage, before beating a hasty retreat in\nthe face of a small army of neon-ed up\nEast 17 fans out looking for a trip up\nIrony Memory Lane. Veteran DJ Annie Nightingale led the energetic (and\nmaybe a little mashed) masses into the\nwee hours, but by that point I was sat\naround a campfire in the Stone Circle,\nlaughing at hippies and ruing the fact\nthat our rather tasty bottle of single\nmalt had been confiscated by Security\non the way in.\nFriday\u2019s breakfast was interrupted\nby the carelessly-forgotten opening\nset of the festival proper, by the ever-entertaining Bj\u00f6rn Again. I say inter-rupted, as I\u2019ve got an allergy to Abba\nthat brings me out in screaming fits,\nso we went to relax in the Acoustic\ntent which was reassuringly free of\ncrap 70\u2019s disco. N*E*R*D brought us\nout of hiding, though - despite being\ndelayed by 30 minutes due to equipment problems, Pharrell Williams was\ndetermined to give the crowd a full\nset - an ambition which was terminated abruptly when the stage manager pulled the plug to set up for the\nFleet Foxes. Never a band troubled\nby a lack of self-belief, they performed\nthe rest of their song from the front of\nthe crowd anyway, even as the road-ies were dismantling their kit around\nthem. The Specials were the inevitable highlight of the day, though, bashing through all the two-tone classics\nwith an energy that belied their\u2026 let\u2019s\ncall it \u2018experience\u2019, and treating the assembled throngs to an hour of intense\nskanking action.\nA little befuddled from a heavy night\nin the chaos of Arcadia, Saturday\u2019s action really got going around lunchtime,\nwith the Eagles of Death Metal\u2019s comedy cock rock. Not necessarily a band\nI\u2019d pay to see again, but not a bad intro\nto Spinal Tap at least, who emerged\nafter a gap of some twenty years in\nall their tasteful, understated glory.\nDancing midgets in monks\u2019 robes?\nCheck. Open-chord bass lines, turned\nup to 11? Check. Ah\u2026 the good old\ndays were back, for a glorious forty-five\nminutes. Even Jamie Cullum sounded\ngood, guest-appearing on keyboards -there must have been something in the\nair.\nThe mood was promptly ruined by\nDizzee Rascal, who I still don\u2019t quite\nunderstand the point of. Featuring the\nsingle lamest tribute to Michael Jackson of the festival (we knew he\u2019d died\ndue to the sudden influx of paedo-phile jokes on everyone\u2019s phones), Mr\nRascal hammered through just about\nevery song he\u2019s ever recorded in his\nset, culminating in Bonkers - which,\nyou\u2019ll be glad to know, is still rub-bish. Kasabian rescued the day, with a\nswaggering set that finally lifted them\nabove Oasis-tribute-act status, but\nthey were always playing second fiddle\nthe Boss, Bruce Springsteen himself.\nWith more gas than most acts half his\nage, the rapturous crowds absorbed\ntwo and a half hours of his trademark\nblue-collar rock; although the Timmies\nand Hermiones who make up about\nthirty percent of Glastonbury\u2019s crowds\nnowadays didn\u2019t always get the point, a\nmassive crowd cheered every song well\npast the curfew and into \u2018Boss time\u2019,\nthundering to a finish with the crowd\npleasing Glory Days.\nConscious of the increasing fragility of the audience, Sunday kicked off\ngently with a bit of reggae and veteran\nrockers Status Quo, who gathered an\nvast crowd considering their early slot.\nEnter Shikari disappointed, considering the fluency of some of their earlier live work, but Tom Jones got the\nwhole festival crooning along in what\neffectively became the world\u2019s largest\nkaraoke booth. Madness picked up\nthe tempo again immediately, carrying on where the Specials had left off\non Friday: having not played the festival in ten years or more, they brought\nthe full show and played through the\npain induced by a drinking session the\nnight before that immediately became\nfestival lore. The Prodigy\u2019s lacklustre\nattempt to close out the festival did\nthem no justice at all, but Blur did a\nsuperb job in their first big live show\nin a decade, charming the crowds and\nmaking everyone wonder why they\nstopped the first time around.\nEasily the most varied, most intense\nand most important festival of the\nyear, next year is Glastonbury\u2019s 40th\nanniversary and the smart money\u2019s on\nU2 to headline. I\u2019ll see you there.\n\n"

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 16 OCTOBER 2009\nCOMMENT\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nVicky Masding\u2019ssacrificesforfashion\n\u201cI will seek these\nbabies out in a mass\nof bland clothing,\nkeep them captive\nand revel in them.\nMaybe not quite\nthat disturbingly.\u201d\nI\ndo not know about you or you\n(my two readers), but I am currently in love with the embellishment and ornamentation on\nclothes I have seen. No matter\nhow obscene, it seems to have some\nkind of allure. Some beading, I admit\ncan at times be gaudy, obnoxious even,\nin its design; yet like those overly cocky\nguys performing their nightly \u2018gunshow\u2019 in their tight Ts and wife beat-ers, there is still some kind of hidden\ncharm beneath the bravado! \u2018Sometimes\u2019 (with slight withering belief).\nAnd so I am hoping this is a true affection I have found, rather than, as I\nsadly suspect, my overly suggestible\nsoul has been convinced by asos.com\nto buy anything reflective. Conversely,\nI fear this love is no new fling, rather, it\nresembles stalker-esque behavior with\ngrowing similarity; I will seek these\nbabies out in a mass of bland clothing,\nkeep them captive and revel in them.\nMaybe not quite that disturbingly.\nNevertheless, I have chosen to take\nthem on into the Narnia-like realms of\nmy wardrobe and accept whatever fate\nthey shall bring me.\nI currently have a jumper that is so\nheavily beaded on the shoulders it is\ngoing to add some serious tone to my\nupper arm muscles (in relation to their\ncurrent state of course\u2026little bit of a\ndisclaimer there). This purchase was\nmade in Prague while \u201cinter-railing\u201d\n\u2013 a term I have taken to using when\ndescribing my Europe-wide shopping\ntrip.\nBudapest currently takes the No.1\nprize for its hidden backstreet shops.\nOne tiny shop in particular, had no\nother customers, and for about ten\nminutes no shop assistant, so it was\njust me in a room full of clothes; a reality I am in no way uncomfortable with.\nI was however soon joined by a puppy\nsausage dog who was to be my spirit\nguide it seems, throughout the shopping experience. Eventually a young\nwoman did appear, but the overall tone\nof the place didn\u2019t change, she was refreshingly discreet as shop assistants\ngo. The only anomaly in this otherwise\nperfect Alice in Wonderland style situ-ation, was the fact I was soaking wet\u2026I\nshould make it clear this was physical\nevidence of my level of devotion to\nshopping. I left my youth hostel in flip\nflops and a summer dress. It started\nraining. I carried on. All day. So it was\nfar from a fashionable peak for me, in\nfact my fashion mistakes are probably\nfar more note worthy. On one particular occasion, I purchased some vintage\ncowboy boots \u2013 sounds fine, until you\nhear they were knee high white pearlescent leather with cut out design\u2026\nmy face just contorted at the thought. I\ngave them to my mum, she loved them;\nI realize this was unwise.\nSince being back at Imperial I have\nforgotten how to dress. The reason being that I am Hall Senior in Beit, and\nas such I have had to develop a love\nfor ketchup red and sunshine yellow\nt-shirts; a skill I am yet to master. The\nonly consolation being, that they are\nlimited edition and in short supply.\nAs this article has so far been chronicling my life right up to last week, I\nshall update you on my current state.\nHaving woken up at 16:41 (Awwwww\nnoooo, not a good way to start the\nyear) due to staying up in the common room until four with some hard-drinking freshers, I have had the rest of\nthe evening to watch Fringe and ponder my attire for undoubtedly another\nnight of complete waste. I had settled\non joggings and a top (I thought I\nwould keep it vague to avoid mockery)\nwith flip flops. I have since decided\nsocks would be an idea and a half considering the hellish turn the weather\nhas taken (I think it\u2019s a sign from God\nthat I should do some work this year,\nno particular connection \u2013 only that he\ncontrols the heavens or whatever and\nI think I\u2019m practically on parole\u2026forgive my paranoia) Anyway, as if underpinning the essence of my day I have\nrealized my socks are odd, not so odd\nit\u2019s cool, just a little bit odd, so that it is\ngenuinely feeble.\nDominic Cottrell has a passion for psychiatry\n\u201cBut apart from\na brief phase of\nwanting to be a\nmagician or maybe\na sweet maker for\nme it was always\npsychiatry\u201d\nW\nhen I was young,\nI wanted to be\na psychiatrist.\nMy friends went\nthrough phases of\nwanting to be astronauts, soldiers or\nsimply in charge of everything ever.\nBut apart from a brief phase of wanting to be a magician or maybe a sweet\nmaker for me it was always psychia-try. To this day I have no idea why any\nnine year old should want such a thing;\nmaybe watching The Silence of the\nLambs made too much of an impression on me (something I did not talk\nabout during my interview) or maybe\nit was due to an earnest and genuine\ninterest in other people. The point is\nmoot anyway, as I don\u2019t think I want to\nbe a psychiatrist anymore.\nIn the body of knowledge that is\nmedicine, psychiatry sits where the\npineal gland used to: for some, it is the\ninterface between the body and the\nmind; for others it is a curious structure with no real positive purpose. Of\ncourse, neither of these perspectives is\nfair. Psychiatrists, along with psychiatric nurses, social workers and everyone else in the field of mental health,\nperform a vital and by and large under\nappreciated job. I am not an \u201canti-psychiatrist\u201d and this is not a critique of\nthe field of psychiatry as it exists. Such\na thing is beyond the scope of this ar-ticle, and its author. It is an attempt to\nunderstand why psychiatry is not associated with heroic medics as, say, cardiology or emergency medicines are;\nor why psychiatry isn\u2019t considered a\nprogressive success story like genetics\nand immunology.\nOf all the medical specialities, few\nare as contentious in the public mind.\nFor one thing, it\u2019s seen as slightly sinis-ter. I suspect this is partly due to people\u2019s fears of being reduced, actually\nand symbolically, to a series of neuro-chemical and behavioural events. This\nis the sentiment underlying the epithet\n\u201cheadshrinkers\u201d or \u201cshrinks\u201d; by offering drugs to cure depressions, delusions and fears like any other ailment,\nthere is an implication that it is possible to cure the things that make us in-dividual: our irrationalities, quirks and\nflaws; the \u201ckingdom of infinite space\u201d\nbecomes reduced, shrunk. It is worth\nremembering that until only 1974, the\nDSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the guidebook\nof American psychiatry) considered\nhomosexuality to be a valid symptom\nof a diseased mind, not an integral\ncomponent of identity.\nThis brings us to the second reason\nwhy psychiatry is often viewed with\nmistrust: its history has been, on oc-casion, very dark indeed. In its more\nrepressive form, the Soviet Union essentially created a new and conveniently vague form of schizophrenia,\nsluggishly progressing schizophrenia\nto isolate and silence dissidents in state\nrun psychiatric hospitals (Psikhushka)\nand subject them to degrading and\ninhumane treatments. A little before\nthis, an American psychosurgeon\nnamed Walter Freeman had invented a\nnew and more efficient means of lobot-omising patients severing the prefrontal cortex to calm excitable patients by\ninserting a long thin skewer into the\norbital socket. Before developing the\nleucotome and orbitoclast, Freeman\nstarted with an ice-pick. Near the end\nof his career, Freeman was reduced to\ntravelling the country in what he called\n\u2013 I kid you not \u2013 his \u201clobotomobile\u201d,\nsearching for former patients to attest\nto the efficacy of his procedure. We\nlive in more enlightened times and it is\nunfair to judge the subject on the sins\nof the past. However, those looking for\nevidence for atrocities in psychiatry\u2019s\npast have no trouble finding them.\nBut, as I am neither a scientologist,\nnor opposed to the medicalisation of\ncertain behaviours, why am I having\ndoubts about entering the profession? I\nsuspect it\u2019s because I am unsure of how\nto regard many current psychiatric ill-nesses. I am unsure whether ADHD is\nan actual sickness, or a label to sani-tise the notion of unruly children. As\nnewspapers proudly announce the\ndiscovery of the gene \u201cfor\u201d violence,\nintelligence and other things, I grow\never more concerned that medicine\nis taking on too much of a social role:\nthe pharmacopeia replacing the prison\nand neurodeterminism encroaching\nupon self-responsibility. Maybe that\u2019s\nreasonable and appropriate, maybe our\nsociety has evolved. I doubt it.\n\n"

    "content": "Women\nwin again\nThis Wednesday was the official start\nof the season and lucky as we always\nare, we had to go all the way to brighton to play our first match with our\nbrand new squad. Needless to say that\nthis took us most of our day and was\nquite a mission (especially for some of\nus, will not name names\u2026.(Tanya our\nformer captain).\nSo off we were the three of us (new-comers Gigi and Siree, and me) (Tan\nwas gonna join us later)) to start our\nmatch at 1. brighton is quite a strong\nteam and they actually managed to\nbeat us last year. But with the scary\nsituation that we faced last year (nearly\nbeing relegated! when we use to win\nour leagues every year), we knew we\nhad to win this one and get a good\nstart against one of our most serious\ncontenders.\nWe all got started with our matches\npretty fast. Looking at Siree and Gigi\u2019s\nmatch from the court where I was\nplaying, I could see that they were having good rallies but that our girls were\nwinning most of the points. Indeed, Siree finished pretty quickly which is not\nsurprising since when we arrived at the\ncourts the captain from the other team\nexplaining to Siree\u2019s opponent how to\ncount scores in tennis! So here we are\nwith already one win by our new medic\nfresher.\nGigi\u2019s win was soon to follow as she\nwas already one set up when I was still\nstruggling in the middle of my first set.\nI had already play my opponent last\nyear and the first set was fairly tight,\nand after failing to win my set point I\nlost the set( I know\u2026..). My opponent\nJulie got a good start on the second,\nguess I was still annoyed to lose the\nfirst set, but after she was up 2-0 I decided that it was enough and went on\nto win 6 straight games and once the\nsecond set. The match was then decided by a championship tiebreak that\nI won 10-3. So here we were, already\ngarenteed a victory!\nNow let\u2019s come to the funny bit! Tanya was supposed to arrive around 2, so\nlet me explain to you why she turned\nup at the courts at 3ish. See, when you\nget out at flamer\u2019s station (from which\nyou can actually see the huge white impossible to miss tennis club) you can\nleave the station from two sides. Tanya\ntook a chance and picked the wrong\none. This resulted in my phone ringing\nduring most of my match.\nBut she managed and finally got\nhere, all red obviously (probably a mix\nof exhaustion and shame (please let me\ntell you that this is soooo not like Tanya to be a mess). And there she started\nbut sadly was up against a really , really\n, really good player that had no mercy\nfor her, which resulted in tanya losing .\nNext week we are playing Portsmouth at South Park.\nRobert Bush Women\u2019s Tennis\nAndrew Lavery Gaelic Football\nLast weekend, the lads of IC Men\u2019s\nGaelic Football team assembled and\ntook the trip west to St. Mary\u2019s to represent and hopefully regulate a tournament in the curtain raiser to this year\u2019s\ncampaign.\nWith a well attended first training\nsession behind us, IC were comfortably able to field two teams playing 7\u2019s\nfootball as opposed to the usual 15 a\nside.\nThe format for the day was to be a\nblitz against hosts St Mary\u2019s, Brighton\nUniversity and a local entrance from\nRound Towers GFC.\nIn the first of four matches to be\nplayed IC played against a much favoured St Mary\u2019s tea. It is worth pointing out that Mary\u2019s usually compete\ntwo divisions above IC in the top flight\nof the British Gaelic Football Championships. Mary\u2019s were made to work\nhard against an energetic performance\nof IC who had no care for their opponent\u2019s reputation and brought the\ngame to them in a spirited fashion.\nOpening exchanges were tit-for-tat,\nIC even going ahead at one stage before\nMary\u2019s showed their class and ran away\nwith the match in the second half with\na brace of goals.\nOur next match was against a new\nopposition in the form of Brighton\nUniversity.\nThe beach boys made the journey up\nwith the best of intentions but their\nnewness to the game was evident and\nIC\u2019s relative experience came to the\nfore with us comfortably dictating the\npace and possession of the match from\nthe midfield taking some fine scoring\nopportunities along the way.\nIC having entered two teams then\nwere due to play each other. With a\nchanging of teams into IC Blues and IC\nWhites the game was a exhibition affair with team members trying to embarrass each other and generally make\na name for themselves.\nOur final match of the day was\nagainst a very strong team from Round\nTowers - a Senior London team.\nThe two teams IC fielded were audaciously shuffled so we lined out our top\n7 to take on the old hands of the game.\nIn possibly our best performance of\nthe day we took the game to RT and\nlike the first match of the day, IC went\nahead before conceding some goals\nwhich would ultimately decide the outcome of the match.\nAt the day\u2019s end IC finished in 3rd\nand 4th place in the tournament ahead\nof Brighton while RT went on to win.\nAgainst some fine opposition the boys\ndid the blue and white proud and if the\nweekend performance is anything to\ngo by IC will be flying high once again\nthis year at National Championships in\nFebruary.\nSpecial mention to Padhraic Comerford who easily walked away with\nmost improved player of the day, by the\nthird match creating several threatening attacks on his first day playing the\ngame. Strong performances by Michael\nMcGarvey and Sean Dunne in goals\nhelped the team out greatly.\nAnd of course team \u2018bomber\u2019 Stevie G who actually managed to score a\ngoal in the course of the day.

This time it\u2019s\nWindows mobile in the\nspotlight, or should I say\nWindows Phone? Yeah, rubbish name\nI know, but Microsoft wants to transition towards a \u2018Phone\u2019 brand and away\nfrom the Pocket PC days of Windows\nmobile. Windows Phone is still only\nWindows Mobile 6.5 and as such still\nsucks in my opinion. A dated mobile\noperating system that simply hasn\u2019t\nkept with the times. I know there are\ngoing to be a few of you who are still\npassionate about pocket Microsoft,\nbut look at the lengths companies like\nHTC go to just to skin the UI and make\nit user friendly.\nHowever, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom\nfor Windows mobile in Europe at least\nas we got the launch of the HTC HD2.\nThis is an absolute beast of a device\nwith a massive screen, Snapdragon under the hood and a whole lot of HTC\nUI magic up front.\nAmazon announced this week that\nits highly sought after US only Kindle\ne-book reader is going international.\nThe new GSM based Kindle will be\nheading to over 100 countries and\nwill be available in the US for $279. Of\ncourse international pricing has yet to\nbe announced, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we get screwed with the currency conversion and it\u2019s at least \u00a3279\nin the UK. Feature-wise it will be identical to the current generation Kindle,\nso except for the Amazon book store\naccess there\u2019s not that much you can\u2019t\nget in a Sony reader. Amazon haven\u2019t\nannounced that their \u2018academia aimed\u2019\nKindle DX will make an appearance\nout of the US, but to be honest it\u2019s not\ncut out for what Amazon are aiming\nat. Until we can scribble on the screen\nand e-ink displays increase their refresh rate, they\u2019re simply not going to\nbe useful for reading text books or pa-pers. Believe me I\u2019ve tried and it\u2019s not\nworth the hassle.\nGood news for UK iPhone users\nseeking a way to watch TV on their de-vice. BBC\u2019s iPlayer has been available\nfor some time on Apple\u2019s golden child,\nbut those seeking ITV, C4 or Five programs have been out of luck. Into the\nbreach steps TVCatchUp.com, with\nan iPhone optimised site with free live\nstreaming of 11 TV channels including BBC, ITV, C4 and Five channels\nin impressive quality, on WiFi at least.\nThose without an iPhone can still get\nin on the party with over 30 channels\nstreamed live on TVCatchUp.com.\nOK, a free initial signup is required\nand the streaming is supported by ad-vertising, but free live TV streamed\nanywhere in the UK is nothing to be\nsniffed at.\nThe cloud took a bit of a knock this\nweek with T-mobile\u2019s disaster compounded by Apple\u2019s Mobile Me service\nhaving serious problems. Private user\ndata was displayed to the world and\nthe service has been pretty flakey all\nweek. Still where some fail, others tri-umph, with Google pushing out shared\nfolders to it\u2019s Google Docs online office suite. Big news if you happen to\nuse the Google service as you can now\nshare whole folders full of documents,\nspreadsheets, PDFs etc instead of just\nsingle documents. If you happen to be\nworking on a collaborative project you\nmight want to check it out.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nWeekly Wrap Up \u2013 The Best of the Rest\nS\no what\u2019s been happening this\nweek? Well, Rupert Murdock\u2019s been making waves\nthis week with two announce-ments. First up we\u2019ve got Sky Songs\nmusic streaming service, a Spotify\npremium competitor, which is due to\nlaunch Monday next week. For \u00a36.49\nor \u00a37.99 you get unlimited streaming\nof over 4 million tracks as well as 10 or\n15 MP3 downloads respectively. Sky\nare marketing this as the \u2018mainstream\u2019\nusers service, providing music to those\nwho don\u2019t know much about technology or music. Sky also said that its\niPlayer like service, Sky Player, would\nbe coming to the Xbox 360. Sky Player in the living room on the 360 with\nboth live streaming and On-Demand\ncontent sounds like a winner to me,\nalthough I would swop Sky for Netflix\nstreaming any day of the week. There\nwill of course be fees involved and may\nbe bundled in with certain Sky packag-es, but you may end up seeing Premiership football on your Xbox in the near\nfuture. Sky Player for the 360 is being\nlaunched on the 27th October.\nently Apple has put out a bootloader\nupdate that essentially makes the\niPhone 3GS unjailbreakable by current methods. Why it took Apple so\nlong to do this is anyone\u2019s guess, but\nit\u2019s a major setback for the iPhone DevTeam and friends. On the App front,\nDirected Electronics have released an\napp that makes it possible to remotely\nstart, lock or unlock your car from\nanywhere in the world with just your\niPhone.

Whether it be your email, online\nstorage, bookmarks, contact syncing\nor even your backup, pretty much everything is moving to the cloud. There\nare many potential benefits of this kind\nof solution, one of them being that you\nhave access to your data wherever you\ngo. Most of you will have used web\nemail like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail\nor even the Imperial Outlook web access at some stage and therefore can\nattest to this up side. But, inherent in\nthe design and operation of cloud solutions there are problems that could\ncause major issues if you rely solely on\nthese services. One of them is discon-nection; this is probably the most frequent problem with cloud-based solu-tions. For email, an outage of a couple\nof hours might not be too much of an\nissue, but what about services such as\ncloud computing and storage? Well\nthis week has been one of the worst\nweeks for cloud computing of all time\nand it all revolves around user data.\nT-Mobile has been selling the SideKick line of devices for a long time now.\nFor those unfamiliar with the SideKick,\nit\u2019s basically a messaging feature phone\nand a popular one at that. It accesses a\nserver for basically everything it does,\nincluding the basics like looking up\ncontacts. Everything that\u2019s stored on\nthe phone is uploaded to the SideKick\nservers where it is accessed whenever\nyou do something on your phone. It\u2019s\nsafe, secure and convenient. So much\nso that most people using the phones\nwon\u2019t even notice it. Well, that is until a\nproblem arises and that\u2019s exactly what\nhappened this week for T-mobile in\nthe US. To cut but a finer point, some\nidiot screwed up on the server side of\nthings, failing to make a decent backup\nof users data before doing a \u2018routine\u2019\nupgrade on the server. Rumour has it\nthe upgrade was out-sourced to Hitachi and ran into \u2018complications\u2019. The\nnet result was that Danger/T-mobile\nlost all the data of a fair few SideKick\nusers with little to no chance of getting\nit back. Now you would have thought\nthat this just meant that the data that\nSideKick users moved to the server\nwas lost. Although this could potentially be a big deal, it would not be the\nend of the world. However, due to the\nway that the SideKick works, anything\nthat\u2019s not on the server but still on the\nphone is lost when you reboot or turn\noff the phone, essentially like storing it in RAM only. T-mobile issued a\nstatement to all SideKick users urging\nthem to not let the phone lose power,\nreboot or take the battery out. Lack\nof access is one thing, but total loss of\nall your user data is a whole other ball\ngame, especially when it arises that it\u2019s\ndue to the human error of not backing up properly for an upgrade to in-frastructure. Admittedly your average\nuser doesn\u2019t backup their data nearly\nenough. It can be a faff, it\u2019s boring and\nit\u2019s something you don\u2019t think of until\nit\u2019s too late. For a company storing user\ndata on its servers, backup is essential\nand should be thorough and automatic.\nFor Danger to lose all its users\u2019 data\nfrom a paid service is totally inexcusable\nand someone is absolutely certain to be\nmade recently unemployed.\nThere are two key ramifications of\nthis disaster, one being it will \u2018probably\u2019 never happen again. The other\nis that users might think twice about\nrelying on cloud-based solutions even\nfor everyday tasks. You might think\nthat Google or Microsoft or any of the\nbig players are immune to this kind of\nmistake, but let\u2019s not forget that after\na recent purchase it\u2019s Microsoft who\nnow own Danger.\nSo if you\u2019re a keen cloud user, and if\nyou\u2019re reading this you probably use\nat least one cloud solution even if you\ndon\u2019t realize it, you should take note of\nall the SideKick users\u2019 plights and think\nabout backing up. Whether it\u2019s your\nphone contacts, your pictures, your essays or your banking records, don\u2019t just\nrely on the provider to back up your\nstuff, make sure you have at least one\nlocal copy. Backup now and forgo the\npain of lost data.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor in your pocket on a daily basis.

It was hoped\nthat the impact would create a cloud of\ndust from the crater that could be analysed for the presence of water. If water\ndoes exist on the moon it will certainly\nbe easier to make it a pit stop on the\nway to future planets.

I\ndon\u2019t know if it is just that it\nis a new year, and they are all\nbeing extra cautious, or they\nare actually serious. Last Wednesday\nwe played the Medics, and won. Thus\nit was necessary to celebrate in style.\nWe like to do this by standing on the\ntree of woe in the Quad and drinking\nbeer. I like it there, it\u2019s comfortable and\nI can see everyone. However, this action has been banned by the bloody\nFun Police. For those of you who don\u2019t\nknow about the tree of woe, you can\nprobably have a pretty good stab into\nthe dark to decide what it entails. It\nis a tree, where you will be woeful for\nactions you have committed. Many\ndirty pints have been consumed there,\nand many left there, but it\u2019s just a bit\nof harmless fun. However every time\nsomeone stands upon its hallowed po-sition, some Margaret runs over and\ngives you a right bollocking. I\u2019m not\nsure I think this is acceptable.\nWhat is the worst that can happen?\nIs it only me who thinks if you fall over\nand hurt yourself, it is you that is to\nblame? Not the floor, not the fact that\nthere wasn\u2019t a warning sign, not the\nfact that nobody stopped you. It\u2019s your\nfault you twat. To be brutally honest\nif you need a warning sign saying that\nwater coming out of a hot tap is going\nto be hot, then you deserve to burn\nyourself.\nMy idea of fun, before Union antics,\nis to spend my time standing on the\ngoal line of a hockey pitch, waiting for\nsomeone to hit a ball at me.

The end result is the\nbiggest (by percent) student enrolment in the gym, and sporting\nclubs as a whole. For freshers, you\nhave to have an induction to ensure\nthat you don\u2019t get tangled up in a\nweights machine and strangle your-self. Boring as shite, but you have to\ndo it.\nFinally, the real reason that you go\nfor a session is not to buff up, but\nto sit on the bikes and check out\nthe arses of the girls who are on the\nrunning machines.

What\u2019s left is\nan upbeat, pulsing pop record with a\ncatchy (if a bit mundane) hook and sultry Roxy Music-esque vocals. This is a\ndefinite move towards the mainstream\nand it\u2019s a good one. - Tom Hird\nTHE CHEEK\nHUNG UP\nA&M\nIt\u2019s as though they rounded up Daft\nPunk\u2019s guitars, Justice\u2019s child choir,\nMika\u2019s falsetto vocals, and pulled it together with the synthy pop of Phoenix.\nThis song would be fun if you were on\na good night out and the DJ dropped\nit and you danced like a child after too\nmany sweets, It\u2019s a one night stand of a\nsong, really. - Alex Ashford\nWith a name like that I pictured a\nbunch of dirty south rappers, in an obnoxiously luxurious lounge of a night-club, sippin\u2019 on some purple drank.\nBut actually this new side project of\none of the Fratellis seems to be trying\nto prove you can make a decent rock\nand roll record with a skilled orchestra.\nToo many cooks\u2026 Alex Ashford\nCODEINE\nVELVET CLUB\nVANITY KILLS\nISLAND\nRECORDS\nThis embryonic album uses abstract\nelectronic sounds throughout, and\nhave psychedelic themes, which can be\na nice change to the sterile, produced\nmusic around today, Ultimately it\ndoesn\u2019t tap the true power of The Flaming Lips. It\u2019s background music and\ngreatly self-indulgent. - Luke Turner\nSINGLE\nSINGLE\nTHE FLAMING\nLIPS\nEMBRYONIC\nWARNER BROS\nALBUM\nPASSION PIT\nLITTLE SECRETS\nCOLUMBIA\nSINGLE\nSometimes I wonder if I\u2019m losing the\nplot a bit because I hate every whiny\nindie rock boy band CD we get sent,\nthen I hear a song like this, with reggae\nlegend Horace Andy\u2019s deep vocals over\na crawling trip-hop reggae melody, and\nI realize all is not lost. Massive Attack\nare consistently head-and-shoulders\nabove most music. Overall the EP\nis dark and introverted, like a weird\nweekend come down. - Alex Ashford\nMASSIVE\nATTACK\nSPLITTING THE\nATOM\nVIRGIN\nEP\nSimilar in places to other bands like\nBig Pink and MGMT with a similar\nIndie kind of feel, Little Comets are in-fectious, fun and easy going. Adultery\nas a single is upbeat and melodic with\ncatchy lyrics that you\u2019ll eventually find\nyourself singing along to in the street.\nIt\u2019s definitely worth a listen on iTunes/\nSpotify whenever you\u2019ve got a minute,\nand then you\u2019ll probably finding yourself going to buy it. - Ben Cook\nLITTLE COMETS\nADULTERY\nCOLUMBIA\nSINGLE\nExhibiting a much more mellow side\nthe Arctic Monkeys latest taster from\ntheir relatively unemphatically received third album \u2018Humbug\u2019 is certainly a highlight. Musically it is one\nof the less radical progressions of their\nnew sound but this single, whilst probably not residing in their top draw, as\nprevious albums have left it pretty full,\nis still a very worthwhile listen. - Chris\nWalmsley\nARCTIC\nMONKEYS\nCORNERSTONE\nDOMINO\nSINGLE\nZero7\u2019s fourth album, has a relaxing\nyet uplifting chilled sound. However I\nfeel their style is stuck a decade behind\ncurrent musical trends. The album\nlacks continuity with each song sounding as if it\u2019s been selected from a multitude of different artists and ripped to\na single disc. No song, I feel, on this\nalbum will captivate listeners. A disappointing album compared to their previous work. - Craig Glastonbury\nZERO 7\nYEAH GHOST\nATLANTIC\nALBUM\nBiffy used to be an incredibly interesting band. The latest single \u2018The Captain\u2019 is anthemic, evidently displaying\nambitions of arena tours. It seems like\ntheir idea of making a chorus interesting is adding some token horns at its\nend. It\u2019s a shame to see a band that used\nto be exciting, now treading a generic\nline of mediocrity. - Chris Walmsley\nBIFFY CLYRO\nTHE CAPTAIN\n14TH FLOOR\nSINGLE\nAsh embark on ambitious A-Z project\nKadhim Shubber speaks to frontman Tim Wheeler as Ash set out to change the music world\nT\nim Wheeler is a little wor-ried, excited too of course\nbut a little worried that Ash\u2019s\nalphabetic adventures might\nfall flat on their face. He\u2019s just flown in\nfrom New York where he and the band\nhave spent the last year and a half recording for their A-Z single series. A\nmatching tour, hitting 26 venues each\nbeginning with a letter A-Z, begins on\nMonday in Aldershot which he claims\nis partly to tie in with the single series\nand mostly to do with having fun and\n\u201cdoing things that not a lot of people\nhave done before\u201d.\nThe grueling schedule doesn\u2019t faze\nhim, \u201cI\u2019ve taken up kick-boxing so I\u2019m\nfighting fit\u201d he jokes, clearly it\u2019s not\nthe tour that\u2019s worrying him. The band\nare embarking on a project which says\ngoodbye to the album and hello to\nquick-fire singles.\nAsh\u2019s gripes about the album have\nbeen well documented since 2007,\nwhen announcing their intentions after\nthe release of their last album Twilight\nof the Innocents, Tim declared that \u201cI\u2019m\nconstantly disappointed with records I\nbuy\u201d\nThe ill-feeling stems from a desire for\ngreater creative freedom and a reading\nof the musical landscape that could\nprove to be prescient. \u201cThe album was\njust so restrictive, with singles we can\nexperiment more and not be tied down\nto one sound like with an album\u201d.\nAsh are clearly a band who have no\ntime for hanging around, for Tim the\nalbum is simply too slow and distanced\nfrom their fanbase. He theorizes that\nalbums are forced at fans, whereas singles will allow them to become more\nresponsive but also without the creative and financial commitment that a\nalbum requires, allow them to experiment with greater ease.\nIt\u2019s not only albums that have attracted Ash\u2019s ire, the band have also\nshunned the CDs that they\u2019re released on. The A-Z singles are available only by digital download and\n1000 limited 7\u201d vinyls. \u201cCDs have\nbecome really disposable, people just\ndownload them onto their computers and listen to them on their iPods\nanyway so what\u2019s the point?\u201d. They\u2019ve\nalso offered their fans magazine-style\n\u2018subscriptions\u2019 whereby they will automatically receive the singles when\nthey\u2019re released.\nGiven that Ash are so eager to tear\nthe rulebook to shreds it\u2019s interesting\nthat Tim falls squarely into the Lilly\nAllen camp of the current debate on\nmusic piracy. He talks emotively about\nthe vast majority of people who work\nin the music industry on average salaries whose jobs are directly at threat\nbecause of music piracy. To him it\u2019s a\nbread and butter issue, while he understands the pro-piracy arguments it\u2019s a\nsimple case of having to make a living,\n\u201cIf we could afford to give our music\naway for free, then we would\u201d.\nWhether or not their venture turns\nout to be financially successful (I suspect that with their fanbase, it will be)\nAsh have shown both pro and anti piracy advocates a possible vision of the\nfuture; digital downloads, subscrip-tions, greater interactivity with fans\nand ultimately, the death of the album.\nWhat\u2019s all this alphabet business?\nWhat\u2019s the A-Z project?\nAh well, basically Ash are releasing\na single every two weeks, each one\ntitled A, then B etc until they\u2019ve gone\nthrough the alphabet\nNo album then?\nThey don\u2019t make albums anymore!\nReally?\nYeah, in 2007 they released their final album Twilight of the Innocents\nand announced that they would only\never release singles from then on.\nThe first came out on the 12th\nAny explanation?\nTim Wheeler said basically said\nthat the album was dead, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t\nhelped that most people have\nforgotten how to make a decent\nalbum.\u201d\nControversial?\nYeah but he is fit... .....I mean\ntalented!\nThe band\u2019s sound is heavily influenced\nby the left-leaning political punk of\ntwenty years ago, but they are much\nmore convincing when they put the\nfucking placards down for a minute\nand sing about something they\u2019ve actually experienced.

The\nprotest took place a day\nafter President Barack\nObama said he would move\nto end a ban on gay people\nserving openly in the mili-tary. Since coming to office,\nMr Obama has taken steps\ntowards addressing gay rights issues, but protestors were saying he has not\ndone enough, particularly on the issue of same-sex partnerships.

After Ireland ratified the Lisbon Treaty last week, this time voting in\nfavour, the European Union is shifting gears. Irish voters backed the treaty,\nwhich aims to make the EU \u2018more democratic, more transparent and more\nefficient\u2019, by 67% to 33%, a dramatic turnaround from last year\u2019s result. The\nTreaty would also create a new position for the President of the EU, for which\nTony Blair, the UK\u2019s former Prime Minister, is currently a favourite. Following the Irish ratification, Polish President Lech Kaczynski has signed the Lisbon Treaty on October 10th. Mr. Kaczynski, a Eurosceptic, believes that the\ntreaty will be successful but has stressed that the EU should remain a union of\nsovereign states. That leaves only the Czech Republic, where President Vaclav\nKlaus has so far refused to sign the treaty unless his country is granted an opt-out from the EU\u2019s charter of Fundamental Rights.

As she was registered\nas an EU student holding a Polish\npassport, Agnieszka was told to send\nover her current passport for clarification of status.\nThe passport was sent by Royal\nMail\u2019s Special Delivery service, and\nhence could be tracked. Despite the\ndelivery status having confirmed\ndelivery of the parcel containing\nher passport, the SLC claimed they\nhad not yet received it; Agnieszka\nchecked her personalised account on\nthe SLC status and said there was no\nupdate of her application.\nFurther investigation led Agnieszka to the conclusion that she did\nnot have to submit her passport in\nthe first place, making the last few\nmonths of waiting an absolute waste\nof time and delayed her application\neven further. Two weeks into term\nand she still hasn\u2019t received her loan\nfrom the SLC. In fact, internal disor-ganisation has meant that Agnieszka\u2019s means-tested application is still\nin preliminary stages; the paperwork\nto be filled in by her parents has not\neven been sent out by the SLC.\nAgnieszka described herself as\n\u201cheavily dependent\u201d on her loan\nmoney during term time.

So big in-fact, that the state of California had\nprovided large outdoor screens for\nthe public to view the live event. On\nthe 9th October 2009, 12.31pm British time, the spacecraft Lunar Crater\nObservation and Sensing Satellite\n(LCROSS) crash-landed onto the\nMoon at a speed of 5,600mph. NASA\nconfirmed the empty rocket had successfully crashed 100km from the lunar South Pole in the crater Cabeus.\nThis created a new crater 60ft wide\njust a short distance from the proposed location of NASA\u2019s manned\nlunar base, set to be completed by\nNASA hail mission a success despite claims the impact did not\nproduce the spectacular dust plume expected\n200 billion\nlitres of water\nBrigetteAtkins\nBrigetteAtkins Science Editor\nThe volume of water that could\nbe contained in the permenantly\nshadowed area of the moon at the\nlunar South Pole\n2024. It was hoped this \u2018bombing\u2019 of\nthe Moon, which cost $79 million to\ncarry out, would create a six mile high\ncloud of lunar dirt visible from the\nEarth. The plume would be analysed\nby scientists and used to confirm any\npresence of water around the pole -an essential resource if people were to\ntravel back to the Moon.\nHowever despite confirmation from\nNASA that the crash was successful,\nviewers of the event, broadcast live on\nNASA\u2019s website, were left disappointed\nas there appeared to be little evidence\nof any impact whatsoever. In fact the\nonly evidence that the spacecraft had\ncrashed on the moon was from data\nrelayed back to ground control from\nLCROSS\u2019s own infrared camera. Everything leading up to the crash went\nas planned following the launch of\nLCROSS in Florida back in June this\nyear. The early hours of Friday morning saw the craft split into its two separate components. First, a 2.2 tonne\nempty Atlas V Centaur rocket struck\nthe Moon to create a debris cloud. The\nmain LCROSS craft, itself weighing in\nat 700kg, followed moments later. The\nidea being that it would pass through\nthe plume made by the first part of the\nrocket and collect data before hitting\nthe surface of the Moon four minutes\nafter the Centaur rocket.\nThe full extent of the mission\u2019s success is still unknown. Dr Vincent Eke,\nUniversity of Durham was involved in\nchoosing the location for the crash, \u201cIf\nit turns out to be as dull as it looked, I\u2019d\nimagine the soil just didn\u2019t respond as\nwas hoped to being hit. It might mean\nwe don\u2019t get sufficient data, which\nwould be a shame.\u201d Anthony Colaprete,\n$79 million\nThe total cost of sending LCROSS\ninto space so far. For 2009, NASA\nrequested a budget for the year of\n$16.2 billion, a 1.8% increase on last\nyear\u2019s request\n5,600mph\nimpact speed\nThe Centaur rocket component of\nLCROSS hit the moon at twice the\nspeed of a bullet creating a crater 60ft\nwide\nFinally, a quote from someone of the\nother side that we can cling to. Respected Old Testament scholar and\nauthor Professor Ellen van Wolde has\nmade fresh claims that the first sentence of genesis \u201cin the beginning God\ncreated the Heaven and the Earth\u201d is\nin fact a mis-translation of the original\nHebrew text. A \u201cfresh textual analysis\u201d carried out by the woman herself\nhas suggested that the book never intended to suggest that god created the\nworld, instead claiming that the earth\nwas already there when he created humans and animals.\nThe fresh analysis of the original hebrew text was carried out in the context of the bible as a whole and in the\ncontext of other creation stories from\nancient Mesopotamia.\nThe conclusion was that the hebrew\nverb \u201cbara\u201d (used in the first sentence\nof genesis) does not mean \u201cto create\u201d,\nrather \u201cto spatially separate\u201d. And so\naccording to this, the first sentence\nshould now read \u201cin the beginning\nGod separated the Heaven and the\nEarth\u201d. This contradicts Judeo-Christian tradition, according to which it\nis said god created the Earth out of\nnothing.\nAccording to this, the new analysis\nnow shows that the beginning of the\nBible was not the beginning of time,\nbut the beginning of a narration. She\nsays \u201cIt meant to say that God did\ncreate humans and animals, but not\nthe Earth itself\u201d, and that this view\napparently fits in with ancient texts.\nAccording to Prof. van Wolde, the ancient texts state that \u201cthere used to be\nan enormous body of water in which\nmonsters were living, covered in darkness\u201d, and so logically this fits.\nThe evidence appears scant as to the\nmethod she used to redefine the word\n\u201cbara\u201d since it does technically mean\n\u201ccreate\u201d, but, in her words \u201csomething\nappeared wrong\u201d. She said that \u201cGod\ndid not create, he separated: the Earth\nfrom the Heaven, the land from the\nsea, the sea monsters from the birds\nand the swarming at the ground\u201d.\nFurthermore, she added \u201cthere was\nalready water.....there were sea mon-sters. God did create some things,\nbut not the Heaven and Earth\u201d beThe \u2018Creator\u2019 or the \u2018Separator\u2019?\nNathanLey\nNathanLey Science Editor\n\u201cIt meant to say\nthat God did\ncreate humans and\nanimals, but not\nthe Earth itself\u201d\nthe lead investigator in the LCROSS\nmission, claims sufficient data has\nbeen collected to answer the questions\nset out to be solved by the mission.\nThose leading the project even say the\nlack of the much anticipated explosion\ncould prove to be very promising evidence for water at the crash site in its\nown right, if the spacecraft landed in a\nlake or icesheet.\nThis is not the first Moon bombing\nto have taken place. In 1998, NASA\u2019s\nLunar Prospector mission crashed\ninto a nearby crater and confirmed\nthe presence of hydrogen at the South\nPole of the Moon. However, the dust\nproduced from the impact was insufficient to confirm the presence of wa-ter. If ice is found, the craters covering\nthe estimated 12,500sqkm of permanently shadowed lunar terrain could\nhold as much as 200billion litres of\nwater. Such a discovery would give\npotential for greater Moon exploration once the proposed lunar base\nwas completed and could even allow\nfor missions to Mars to be launched\nfrom the Moon.\nThe mission has come under fire by\ncritics declaring it as a \u2018live-fire test exercise for US war strategies\u2019 and questioning the right NASA has to blow\ncraters into the Moon\u2019s surface at will.\nColaprete dismissed these views saying\ncollisions not dissimilar in magnitude\nto that created by the rocket happen to\nthe Moon several times a month and\nthat no explosives were used during\nthe crash. Since the first lunar probe\nin 1959, an estimated 170 tonnes of\nmaterial has been crashed into or\nabandoned on the Moon as a result\nof more than 50 missions to the lunar\nsurface. By comparision, only 400kg of\nlunar material has been brought back\nto Earth.\nWe will have to wait to know the true\nsuccess of the mission as NASA have\nsaid they do not expect to announce\nany results for at least another two\nmonths. One known success of the\nmission was the burial of the ashes of\nplanetary geologist Gene Shoemaker,\nwhich were carried onboard the craft.\nHe is only person ever to be buried on\na celestial body.\nGenesis: the first book of the Bible where the mis-translation is claimed to have\noccured. Professor Ellen van Wolde claims an alternative meaning\nfore conclusively stating that \u201cThe\nusual idea of creating-out-of-nothing,\ncreatio ex nihilo, is a big misunderstanding\u201d Quite a definitive statement\nthere, one which we should take very\nseriously, and use to anger traditional-ists. Finally, a spokesman for the Radboud University said: \u201cThe new interpretation is a complete shake up of the\nstory of the Creation as we know it.\u201d\nWhat this does for the teaching of\ncreationism or the idea of creationism\non a fundamental level, we probably\nwon\u2019t find out and no doubt people\nwill talk about this \u201cfinding\u201d for a bit\nof light debate. However, at the end\nof the day stuff like this comes up all\nthe time and this story will unfortunately carry no weight in the long\nterm despite Prof van wolde claiming that \u201cThe traditional view of God\nthe Creator is untenable now\u201d. Trying\nto get a quick few minutes of fame,\nperchance?\n\n"

Self-proclaimed rock\nchicks should visit Bershka on the first\nfloor, for the Spanish boutique stocks\nonly ubiquitous in-season items. If you\nare a petite girl and always struggle to\nfind jeans that fit, Bershka is definitely\nyour first stop. The store stocked boyfriend jackets a season before the item\nbecame an insatiable buy months ago.\nSequined jackets, leather leggings and\nblock knitted tunics are just a few other items that might catch your eye.\nAnother Spanish boutique, Blanco\nhas their one and only shop on English\nsoil at Westfield. Aim for shoes, bags\nand accessories there. The studded\nstrappy heels popularised by Givenchy,\nBlumarine and Balmain are reinterpreted by Blanco in a \u00a350 version.\nIf throw-away fashion doesn\u2019t cater to your fine taste and you\u2019re more\nof an all things runway girl, head to\nThe Village, where premium labels\nhave all chosen to fly their flag on the\nfirst floor. Bags and leather goods are\nstocked at Louis Vuitton, Dior and\nGucci. Prada and Miu Miu stock a\nnumber of ready to wear items. Needless to say, more high end fashion\nis available in Knightsbridge where\nHarrods and Harvey Nichols reside.\nSloane Street, between the two legendary department stores, is home\nto countless designer boutiques.\nGiuseppe Zanotti is there, together\nwith other fashion magazine regulars\nsuch as Dolce and Gabbana (you read\nit right, not D&G), Fendi and Chanel.\nLast but not least, the Brompton Road\nhouses Armani\u2019s flagship store with\nits own caf\u00e9 and florist. All this exqui-siteness is only down Exhibition Road\nand take a left. While some can afford\nposh goods, some find it an enjoyment\nto simply adore. Dover Street Market\nis the embodiment of all things stylish and posh, without the scariness of\ncommission hungry sale assitants. The\nRei Kawakubo\u2019s shop stocks not only\nRei\u2019s own designs, but also the hottest\nnew comers. Designers such as Mary\nKatranzou, Mark Fast, Gareth Pugh,\nErdem, Christoper Kane and the like.\nNot to mention McQueen, Yves Saint\nLaurent, Hussein Chalayan and Lavin.\nCalling Dover Street Market a shop is\nalmost disrespectful, for it is in fact a\nmuseum that stocks the season\u2019s most\ncreative pieces, with an option to buy.\nIf you need inspiration for new outfits,\ntake the number 14 from outside the\nV&A and check out the shop\u2019s orien-tal, African and vintage sections or ask\ntheir friendly fashionista staff for ad-vice. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\nThere is of course the famous Oxford street. The street that houses the\nMecca of the high street - Topshop\u2019s\nflagship store.

They\nalso stock some less well known foreign high street stores, which specialise in rock chic or party wear, such as\nBikBok from Norway and again, Bershka from Spain.\nHowever, some of you will want\nmore than just your average high street\nand London can cater to your every\nshopping desire. First on our alternative shopping tour of the city is North\nLondon, or more specifically Camden\nMarket. Full of vintage stalls and edgy\nclothing shops, this area attracts the\nurban cool folks. But also found along\nhere are many alternative shops, as\nCamden is the home of Punk. Those\nwhose style reflects their love of the\nlate 1970\u2019s musical revolution, can find\neverything to express themselves at\nCamden Market.\nThose who follow the new Indie music scene should head straight to East,\nor South East London, where a leather\njacket, leggings and brogue shoes are a\nmust. Home of the art school students,\nliberal youths, and possibly the next big\nthing in British music, the clothes on\noffer reflect the mixing pot of thought,\nart and the general air of creative free-dom. Just off brick lane you will find\nthe Sunday Upmarket which houses\nmany independent designers. You can\npick up an individual item for less than\nyou may think. The surrounding area\nYou might have forsaken your suitcase\u2019s space with note pads and booze (more likely\nthe latter), there is no reason why you should wear the same thing day in day out.

The\nKings Road is the quintessential shopping destination for those who like\ntheir shops to be like how they present\nthemselves, classic and immaculate.\nFor those who still want the West\nLondon experience, but with added\ngrime, then Portobello market will\nbe the place to head.

We got\nto the hut before 2am after hearing a\nhideous version of \u2018Wonderwall\u2019 \u2013 just\nimagine it being sung by a crooner\nwith a little synthetic jazz riffs in the\nbackground. We also heard the song\n\u2018Jolene\u2019 by Dolly Parton, a song that\nwould come back to haunt us.\nThe target for the first day\u2019s walk\nwas Cnicht, also known as the Welsh\nMatterhorn. Cnicht lies to the south of\nSnowdon and is quite isolated, which\nmakes for some interesting route plan-ning. Past Beddgelert in the minibus\nwe turned onto the thinnest, steepest\nand most dangerous road I have been\non in a minibus (outside Scotland of\ncourse). Even Rachel was surprised,\nand Chris cried and screamed that he\ndidn\u2019t want to die (this may or may not\nhave happened). After a terrifying 90\ndegree turn around a house where we\ncould easily have ripped half the roof\noff, we arrived at a car park and I began the first walk of the year by taking\nus into a dense Pine plantation with no\npath. Good start. Yvonne kindly suggested after about 5 minutes that it\nlooked impassable and so back down\nto the road we went and eventually\nfound a marked route.\nYr Arddu is typical of that area, a\nrocky rise in the land with no obvious\nsummit but many high rocky outcrops,\nringed by masses of ferns and heath-er. We snaked our way through this\nlost world, from which we could look\nback at Snowdon covered in cloud and\nahead at Cnicht which was clear to the\nsummit. The discovery of some safety\ngoggles lying in a heather clump was\ntruly mysterious. I imagine whoever\nwas strange enough to actually bring\nsafety goggles to the Welsh mountains\nwill be utterly distraught at their loss.\nIf it was anyone reading this, you are a\ntrue Imperial student!\nThe slight descent from Yr Arddu\nand the ascent up to Cnicht\u2019s ridge is\na land of small abandoned slate mines\n, hidden away behind outcrops, their\nformer roads overgrown tracks and\ntheir slate piles dark industrialised\nrock.\nIt was a short and easy scramble\nfrom there to the summit of Cnicht,\nwhich was well below the clouds. This\nwas the first time several of us, including myself, had been up Cnicht. The\nview south gives a completely different picture of Wales than the impression we are used to of Snowdon and\nthe Glyders, where steep sides become\ncliffs and the summits are high above.\nSouth is the country of giant clumps of\nrock where it must be easy to get lost.\nThat\u2019s my excuse anyway.\nThe descent back to the minibus\nwent along another flatter ridge past\nseveral lyns and then a drop down to\nthe valley where we walked through\nthe woods, on a path this time. Lunch\nUsing the best of excuses to get away for the weekend, the Fellwanderers discover that summer still exists.\nthat day was divided in two, and I think\n\u2018second lunch\u2019 is a phrase we should\nuse more often.\nThat evening we discovered why it\nwas the first and last time that I will\never pack for a trip. I had forgotten\nall the utensils and had only brought\nenough toilet roll for about half an\nhour. Nevertheless, we survived\nthrough the night with enough time\nfor me to buy some more in Beddgelert. Stir fry was followed by cake and\n(very well cooked) custard. Everyone\nwas tired, more from the body-shock\nof being thrust straight back into the\nworld of walking rather than it being\na particularly tough day, so we went to\nsleep soon after playing Werewolf.\nSaturday was a day of sudden changes in decision, which because they\nwent so well is a policy I think we\nshould adopt as a club more often. It\nwas also a day of cooked breakfast, but\nonly because we found eggs and beans\nin the hut and got up a bit earlier.\nThe most important decision was\na change of plan to do the Snowdon\nhorseshoe about two minutes before\nthe turning. The weather was still\npatchy with cloud but there was plenty\nof blue and there\u2019s nothing quite like,\nor more rare than, Snowdon on a good\nday. The car park was packed and so\nwe set off the slightly less popular way\nround of doing Y Lliwedd first. Luckily there were few other people on this\nridge and the views all around were\nhazy as we ascended. There was a\nchunk of cloud on top but it was thin\nand the sun had warmed it into a sau-na, a nice change from the Fellwanderers usual experience with cloud. See\nlater trip reports for this experience\ndetailed in full.\nFirst lunch was before our ascent\nto the Snowdon summit and Chris\ncracked out Wales\u2019 only single malt\nwhisky, which was good despite being\nslightly odd in not having an age.\nEmerging onto the final section\nof the ascent, at around 1000m up,\nthere was suddenly only blue above\nus and perfect white clouds stretched\naway below. Our spirit had even risen\nslightly as it collided with the southern\nridge of Snowdon, a wave on a rock.\nWe climbed the last few dozen metres\nelated and had a long sit on top. I had\nnever seen these conditions, known as\na temperature inversion, in the UK be-fore. Having one on the first trip of the\nyear was hopefully a good sign.\nOur descent was via the legendary\nCrib Goch, which never gets boring.\nMost of the group hadn\u2019t done this\nfamous ridge yet and the conditions\nwere perfect. Even the scary bit (the bit\nthat feels like walking over a 900m high\nwobbly brick wall) went well. And for\nonce we actually found the right way\ndown.\nThat night was a night of firsts and\nlasts. It was the first time (I think) that\njacket potatoes have been dinner. And\napart from a few undercooked beasts\nthey went quite well and were certainly\nfilling, though the tuna mayonnaise\ntook on the appearance of liposuction\nfat after too few stirs let the mayonnaise liquid leak out. Shudder. That\nhowever wasn\u2019t the evil food of the\nevening. Peter and I had found cheap\nbasics Christmas Puddings for desert\nwhich were great on their own and in\nno way needed custard. Since I was already eating when the call for custard\nwent out Chris stepped up to volun-teer. God knows what went wrong. Joe\ntook one look at the horrendous custard sucking the life and joy out of his\nonce beautiful pudding and looked as\nthough life no longer held any joy for\nhim. He ran out of the front door to\nbury it in the garden while Chris ladled\nmore of the offensive custard onto the\npuddings of other innocent victims.\nThe clouds had lowered by the time\nwe left the hut on Sunday and so we\ndrove to Llyn Ogwen to do a section\nof the Glyders. By now Jolene had been\nplayed at least 7 times. It was becoming infectious. We spent far more time\nthan we wanted in the \u2018facilities\u2019 at Idwal Cottage as the Christmas pudding,\ncustard and baked beans had engaged\nin a violent and unfortunate chemical\nreaction in some people\u2019s stomachs.\nOur route for that day took us up the\nDevil\u2019s Kitchen, a rock fall up to the\nGlyders. A path that snakes its way up\nthrough the black stones.\nThe weather changes the feel of this\nwalk dramatically and the cloud base\nwas just above us at the top of the\nkitchen. It wasn\u2019t raining and there\nwas no wind. Upon reaching the col\nthe wind picked up a bit, but we were\nall warm from the climb. Now in the\ncloud we took a left turn onto one of\nthe many paths leading up the barren\nrocky slope to the summit of Glyder\nFawr, sticking together as visibility was\ndown to 20m. Following the cairns\nwe reached the small stone circle of a\nsummit shelter and huddled down in\nwhat were actually quite mild conditions for lunch number one.\nWe followed the ridge path towards\nour next peak, Glyder Fach, scrambling up the boulder field that stretches all around. The summit plateau of\nGlyder Fach has one of the famous\nrock formations for walkers in Wales,\nthe Cantilever, a long slab of rock positioned like one end of a see-saw, giving\nthe impression that any extra weight\nwould tip it. It is, of course, a fantastic\nphoto opportunity. The sun kept getting stronger and the cloud was always\nclose to disappearing but never quite\ndid. Our route down connected up\nwith the Miners track and then turned\nin a giant zig-zag down to the col below\nTryfan where we emerged below the\ncloud. A good spot for lunch number\ntwo! We only half-heartedly attempted\nto follow the Heather Trail along the\nsouthern flank of Tryfan and kept losing it. The Heather Trail, following its\nname, it unhelpfully overgrown along\nmost of its length.\nI hope everyone enjoyed the trip. As for\nJolene,thatbloodysongisstillinmyhead.\nWant to join? fellsoc@imperial.ac.uk\nThe legendary ridge of Crib Gogh. Note the lack of fear.\n\n"

    "content": "35\nfelix FRIDAY 16 OCTOBER 2009\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk GAMES\nToday, felix, I\u2019m going to be... Kirby\nSam Geen is a man to be feared. Take a deep breath as he explains his weapon of choice in Smash Brothers\nI\nam an insurgent. I wait amongst\nthe clouds, descending only to\nstrike when the time is right,\nmelting away as the powerful\nenemy brings his forces to bear on\nmy long-abandoned positions. I am\nMuhammad \u201cI\u2019m Hard\u201d Bruce Lee.\nI float like a butterfly and sting like a\ntruckload of masonry. I am Kirby. I am\na dick.\nKirby is a weak thing. Descended\nfrom some form of gas-giant fauna, he\ninflates his stubby little body to float\naway from the torment of his earthbound foes. Then, when the time is\nright, he turns into a giant brick, falling upon unsuspecting victims. He\ngrabs the nearest enemy, flinging them\ninto the sky and slamming them back\ndown to the ground. He swallows his\nfoes, taking on the characteristics and\ntheir lumbering, land-based body\ncannot hope to return to the arena, is\nrather harsh. Admittedly, the first\ntime you float back up as\nthey fall to their\ndoom is\nrather\nfunny. By\nthe fifth time you\u2019ve\ngrabbed them and\nflung them into the air,\nturned into a brick above\ntheir heads, or disrupted a\nmelee with some cheap hit-and-run\nstrike, it ceases being so entertaining.\nFor them, at least. After all, the Goliaths of the world are rarely amused\nwhen the tiny Davids approach, sling\nin hand, and fling them into the sky.\nKirby has no honour, no valour. Kirby\nfights dirty. Beneath the tiny, pink ex-terior, the combined souls of the Vietcong, Mujahideen and Taliban lie, for\nattacks of the prey. When forced into\na stand-up fight, he gets the pummelling he so richly deserves, but only the\nmost unfortunate or foolish of Kirbies\nbecomes embroiled in that trap. The\nsmart ones are already floating up, up,\nand away.\nI guess some people might think\nit\u2019s cheating. Swallowing another\nplayer, walking off the edge,\nand releasing them\njust at the\npoint where\nKirby swallowed them up and stole\ntheir hats.\nAll this matters, because Kirby is\nweak. As you\u2019d expect for what is basically a small inflatable bladder with\nlimbs that are more lumps than ap-pendages, he tends to get kicked about\na lot. For a game that actively penalises\nyou for dying, this can be a problem.\nWhereas the Links and Donkey Kongs\nof the world are attached to the ground\nlike a fortress, Kirby can be kicked into\noblivion with disturbing ease. Instead,\nhis strength lies in never being in\nthe same place for long enough to\nsuffer that punishment. And, as\nyour ground-based competitors are being picked off\nby a \u201cboop-dee-boopyboop\u201d hammer, you\nare floating amongst\nthe clouds, safe.\nYou will find yourself to be an enemy,\nan outsider. The\nother players may not\nappreciate the lack of honour and up-front fighting they find,\nbut this is the price and the beauty of\nguerilla warfare. Where there is weakness there must be discipline, mobility,\nand an insatiable energy that saps your\ncomplacent foes with their powerful\nweaponry and vast, muscular forms,\nthe Lawrence of the Arabia to their\ncrumbling Ottoman forces. Sure, you\ncan steal Link\u2019s sword or Samus\u2019s gre-nades, but this is merely the icing on\nthe cake of pain that you will lovingly\nbake for your fellow combatants.\nAnd besides, there\u2019s nothing cuter\nthan a tiny little pink space marine\nwaddling around a platform, squealing \u201cFalco-PUNCH!\u201d at the top of his\nsqueaky little voice.\n\u201cKirby fights dirty\u201c\nMister Sandman, bring me a dream\nMake it a sweet action puzzler with charm, sophistication and a bringer of good omens, asks A Geek\nI never have lucid dreams. I cannot recall a single instance where I have had\nany control over my dreaming other\nthan being scared shitless every five\nminutes. And I don\u2019t think that counts\nas control. So despite the title, Lucidity is just about on the money for me,\nbeing about a little girl who trots helplessly through a dreamworld, oblivious\nto the spikes, fire and frogs out to kill\nher. It\u2019s up to you to save her!\nLucasArts - they of the missing-in-action adventure genre - are back in\ndevelopment again and it\u2019s excellent\nnews. The news that some people have\ntaken exception to, however, is that\nLucasArts are taking inspiration from\nthe indie games business model in how\nthey develop - shorter development\nlifecycles, experimental gameplay,\ncheap distribution. Some see it as big\nbusiness muscling in on the little guy.\nIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s good games getting made\nfor once. And this is good.\nLucidity is very similar to Braid in\nterms of its philosophy. You have a\nsimple puzzler built around a core mechanic - with Lucidity, Sofi\u2019s ambling\nthrough levels is unstoppable, requiring you to place items in her way to\nkeep her safe - which varies itself as the\ngame goes on. That puzzler is wrapped\nup in a beautiful soundscape, which\nfor Lucidity means a delightful hand-drawn style and a hauntingly ethereal\nsoundtrack that ties in perfectly with\ndifferent - almost like the Amiga classic Sleepwalker. Sofi becomes the focal\npoint, yet you can\u2019t control her.\nPerhaps most surprising of all is that\nthe story is quite affecting and sad. For\nsuch a small effort that lasts for only a\nfew hours (unless you\u2019re obsessed with\ncollecting things or time trials) its plot\nis very well-formed. It\u2019s along the lines\nof a short film, packing a lot of narra-the dreamworld vibe.\nThe gameplay isn\u2019t terrific,but it does\nhave this quite nice retro flavour to it,\nperhaps unintentionally. Being unable\nto scroll the screen, you can\u2019t see the\ngame\u2019s many secret areas, and getting\nSofi up to some of them requires complex combinations of the randomly-generated items list you\u2019ve been given.\nAnd it\u2019s a fixed space, so it feels quite\ntive into an enclosed space but often\ncoming off better for it. Initially, we\u2019re\nonly told that Sofi has fallen asleep and\nneeds guiding through her dreams. But\nas her dreams turn to nightmares, the\npostcards she finds scattered become\nincreasingly more revealing, and open\nup her mental state and history to the\nplayer. It\u2019s not something I expected.\nSo what am I doing talking about a\ngame that\u2019s been reviewed so many\ntimes, that you\u2019ve probably either not\nheard about or already played? It\u2019s because I want to make sure you understand why Lucidity is here. It\u2019s cheap,\nit\u2019s LucasArts developing again, and\nit\u2019s remarkably well-formed. Three\nvery good reasons to favour it over a\nModern Warfare 2 pre-order. Because\nLucasArts needs support as much as\nindie developers do - not to stay alive\nfinancially, but to stay alive creative-ly. It\u2019s worth showing that you want\nmore of Lucidity. Because more of this\nkind of thing is precisely what gaming\nneeds.\nAs the characters all lined up for an imminent \u2018wall of death\u2019, Mario started to regret a team-bonding Slayer concert\n\n"

It is a very dirty\nword. Since the end of\nthe Second World War\npeople have been keen\nto seem opposed to everything this ideology espouses.\nNazism, despite being specifically\nnamed after the German Nationalsozialismus Party, is a very wide-rang-ing term. Academically considered a\nrelative of Fascism, this ideology incorporates the key elements of racism,\ncollectivism, eugenics, anti-Semitism,\nanti-communism, totalitarianism and\nan opposition to economic and political\nliberalism.\nExcept in Germany under Hitler\u2019s\nChancellorship there has never been\none central movement, but rather combinations of the elements listed above.\nWhy am I banging on about Nazism?\nLast week I came face to face with\nthe most barbaric form of Nazism since\n1945.\nChair Nazis, doing the bidding of\ntheir F\u00fchrer, Simon Bird\u2019s publicist.\nShe may not have had the moustache\nof murderous authority but she implemented her Nazi ideology through her\nband of blue-shirts.\nThey may have just been following\norders but that was no excuse after\nWorld War Two and it certainly will\nnot be now. The severity of the crimes\nagainst humanity exceeded anything I\nhave previously witnessed. I hope I will\nnever live to see such times again.\nLast Thursday was Ms. Publicist\u2019s\nKristallnacht, Kom\u00f6die Nacht if you\nwill.\nThe events of Kom\u00f6die Nacht were\npart of a broader plan of oppression and\npersecution.\nBefore the event even kicked off, Ms.\nPublicist commandeered the RCSU\nevent, forcing the Union to advertise\nit as \u201cSimon Bird\u2019s Event\u201d rather than\nRCSU\u2019s. The event was hijacked by a\nwoman crazed by power.\nBefore the night in question, the\nheadline band due to perform prior to\nthe comedy were removed from the\nmarquee under direct instruction of\nMs. Publicist and forcibly expelled into\nDB\u2019s.\nOn Kom\u00f6die Nacht the Chair Nazis rounded up all those standing and\nforced them to be seated. I was one such\nperson and upon dissention I was given\na strict verbal warning. For fear of being\nbrutally beaten I sat back down.\nMs. Publicist had ordered that no one\nshould be standing except against a side\nof the marquee. What was she think-ing? What a ridiculous thing to ask. I\nwas one of the unlucky ones who had\nto sit right at the back so could not see\na single thing that was happening. Myself and my comrades were up in arms\nabout this decision and tried to reason\nwith the blue-shirts to no avail.\nThe iron grip of the F\u00fchrer was too\ntight around their necks.\nThroughout the whole show, whenever any member of the crowd stood\nup, Simon Bird would bark at them,\ncommanding them to be seated. It was\nvery much a recurring theme, repeated\nconstantly from all sides.\nOne member of the crowd (presum-ably) felt so overwhelmed by this, he\nattacked Simon Bird. I like to think he\nshouted \u201cDown with Chair Nazism\u201d\nwhilst throttling him against a structural pillar. (I would like to point out for\nlegal reasons that I do not condone vio-lence, even when utilised in a struggle\nfor freedom against oppression).\nBy the end of the performance, the\nguard looking over my group of the\npersecuted had vanished allowing us to\nresume our much preferred position of\nstanding with no threat of retribution,\nmuch to Ms. Publicist\u2019s despair (I hope).\nThe people I feel most sorry for are\nthose who dedicated their time and energy into making the event a success,\nnamely the RSCU team. It is such a\nshame that insanity and crazed authority had to screw it up.\nGod, I hate Nazis.\nOn a lighter note, it is wonderful to\nsee a politician striving for the right\nthing. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats and with any luck next\nPrime Minister of the UK, has been\ncalling for more expenses to be repaid.\nHe believes that the expenses audit\nshould be widened to force those who\n\u201cflipped\u201d homes or avoided capital\ngains tax to pay the money they stole\nfrom the taxpayer.\nFor a long time now the Liberal Democrats have been the sole voice calling\nfor changes to the expenses system\nto prevent MPs profiting from homes\nfunded by the taxpayer. It is necessary\nto \u201crebuild faith in politics\u201d to ensure\nthat MPs pay for their unscrupulous\nraping of the system.\nIf we cast our minds back, we will remember that the Conservative MPs had\nthe worst record; a duck pond here, a\nmoat cleaning there... I laughed when I\nfound that last one out.\nTory twat.\nEvery MP who in some way screwed\nus over should be held to account. No\none should be able to escape the uprising of the people demanding their\nmoney back.\nThis comes at a time when it has\ncome to light that, contrary to David\nCameron\u2019s promise, not all Conservative MPs have paid back expenses they\nclaimed wrongly or immorally and even\nthat they perhaps never will repay them.\nI will not be voting for these public\nrapists.\nHowever, to be balanced, retrospective rulings are very on very dubious\nlegal and philosophical foundations. I\nam uneasy with such things but there is\na reason this time to perhaps allow retrospective penalties: to restore public\nconfidence.\nIt is obvious that change is now needed throughout the political system in\nthis country and many others across the\nglobe.\nJamesGoldsack Politics Editor\nShadow Universities Secretary David Willetts supports raising tuition fee cap\nTory \u00a37,000 tuition fee proposal\nWalking into felix today, passing\nthrough South Kensington Station, I\nsaw a London Evening Standard Headline that read \u2018Tories to charge students \u00a37000 fees\u2019. Ouch! I picked up a\ncopy and read the article.\nShadow Universities Secretary David Willetts has today announced he\nis to consider raising the annual fee\ncap from the current \u00a33225 to \u00a37000.\nMany University leaders back the\nmove, including our own Rector, Sir\nRoy Anderson.\nStudent Body NUS President Wes\nStreetling said \u201cIt is of serious concern\nthat the Conservatives seem so relaxed\nabout entertaining the notion of more\nthan doubling fees when they have not\ncommitted to a clear policy for students and their families ahead of the\ngeneral election.\u201d\nDavid Willetts went on to to say that\nuniversities would need to prove the\nextra money would be beneficial to\nstudents, but failed to address the issues of increased student debt and student financing.\nA Government university fee review\nis due within weeks, with calls from the\nconservatives to make it a cross-party\ndebate.\nWith more than 141,000 UCAS applicants left without places after clearing this year, are these plans just a way\nof decreasing applications, rather than\nincreasing the number of quality places available to students? Is the raise to\nbenefit those who will have to pay?\nPhil Murray\nPhil Murray Politics Editor\np\nC\nJames\nJames\nSupporters of President Obama\u2019s reforms march through the streets of Boston\n\u201cCritical milestone\u201d reached for US Health Bill\nObama\u2019s Healthcare Reform Bill has\nthis past week been passed by a Senate\nFinance Committee.\nSince Entering the White House in\nJanuary, Obama has made this reform\nbill his top domestic priority, pledging\nto get this bill passed by the end of the\nyear. And it looks like he might actually do it.\nThe US, unlike the UK or any other\ndeveloped country for that matter,\ndoes not have a universal free healthcare system for its citizens. No NHS,\nmeaning individuals have to fund their\nown healthcare costs, in most cases,\nthrough insurance. This system basically says \u2018No insurance, no hope\u2019. The\nhealthcare costs are rising, and with\nunemployment also rising, more and\nmore Americans every day are unable\nto cover medical costs.\nIn August 2008, the US Census\nBureau estimated that 46.3 million\nAmericans, of a total population of\n300 million (15%), did not have any\nhealth insurance, and millions more\nwere under-insured. This is before\nthe worst of the US economic problems \u2013 it wasn\u2019t until September 2008\nthat Lehman Brothers Bank Collapsed. The numbers would only have\nrisen since then.\nObama\u2019s plan was to help those with\ninsurance keep insurance, those without insurance get insurance, and to\nslow the growth of healthcare costs.\nWhat surprises me most is that there\nhas been a lot of opposition to these\nproposals. How ethically-challenged\nwould someone (mostly Republican\nSenators) have to be to not throw their\nPhil Murray\nPhil Murray Politics Editor full support behind plans to help end\npoverty in one of the most developed\ncountries in the world is beyond me.\nMost arguments come under the\nlame variety of \u2018It\u2019s the immigrants\nfault\u2019, and fail to look at the poor, jobless or just plain unlucky Americans.\nThis being passed shows at least one\nRepublican Senator, Olympia Snowe,\ncoming to her senses, and has broken\naway from the rest of her party by voting with the Democrats on the committee to pass the bill.\nSenator Snowe said \u201dWhen history\ncalls, history calls\u201d, but admits \u201cthere\nare many, many miles to go\u201d. Now that\nit has passed the finance committee, it\nmust go in front of a Senate healthcare\ncommittee, and finally the full Senate\nbefore being passed. There is no guarantee of its final fate.\nPresident Obama called the passing\nof the bill a \u201ccritical milestone\u201d. \u201cWe\nare closer than ever before to passing\nhealthcare reform but we are not there\nyet,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is not the time to\npat ourselves on the back... It is time to\ndig in further and get this done.\u201d\n\n"

Here at\nfelix we can never ever approve of such reckless drinking behaviour. Or can we?\nI\nndia was weird and wacky; a\nplace so alien the Vulcan culture would probably come\nacross as more humanlike.\nThat is at least for the third-world section of India - which is almost everywhere but the vicinity of\nfive-star Taj hotels or the mansions\nof the bourgeois. Reality unravels in\nIndia as fact and fiction become in-distinguishable. In the words of the\nrickshaw drivers, touts and shopkeepers that occupy so much of the tourist landscape, western sensibility is\ntossed out of the window. To paraphrase Salman Rushdie: cows, flies\nand people mingle in a brotherhood of\nshit. I am not joking or exaggerating;\nI have never seen so much cow dung,\nboth fresh and dry with bee hive holes\nmade by flies, lying everywhere from\nthe packed roads to right beside the\nholy bathing ghats, all tolerated and\ncelebrated by the people. India held\nmany fond memories for me: it was\nthe first time I immersed myself truly\nin a third world culture and mingled\nwith its wonderful but wacky people,\nthe first time I hopped in and out of\na moving train, and above all my first\nexperience with a hallucinogenic.\nI have to admit, at 20, I am very\nmuch a virgin to drugs. The closest mind altering substances I have\nconsumed are tobacco and alcohol,\nwith perhaps the most hard-core being absinthe. I have not even tried\nmarijuana. It was not with pride that\nI abstained from drugs - perhaps it\nwas a lack of opportunity or maybe\nI just did not have the guts to grab\nat one when chance presented itself.\nNevertheless, that lack of experience\nfuelled my curiosity when I had the\nchance to try India\u2019s famous, or rath-er, infamous, bhang lassi.\nLassi is a popular Indian yoghurt\ndrink, sour in taste and thick in tex-ture. Bhang is a pasty derivative of\ncannabis that is allegedly a lot more\npotent than the average marijuana\njoint. The first time I heard of the\nterm \u2018bhang lassi\u2019 was in a travel video\na friend showed me before I went to\nIndia. Go check it out \u2013 put in \u2018bhang\nlassi\u2019 on youtube. India is a land of\nmysticism and naturally, it offers its\nvery own brand of magic drink.\nThe term bhang lassi surfaced on\nmy mind again during my third week\nin India. I was in Pushkar, one of\nthe major tourist spots in Rajasthan,\nwestern India. It has a reputation as\na shopper\u2019s paradise \u2013 Indian fabrics\nand handicrafts from all around India could be found right at Pushkar\nthanks to its history as a trade cen-tre. Indeed, the whole of Pushkar\nis a bazaar of scarves, clothes, traditional clothes, woodwork, stones,\ncamel bone carvings, etc, with the\noccassional food shop or guesthouse\nputting a gap in the millipede of\nshops. Pushkar is also one of the most\nsacred Hindu cities in India because\nit hosts the sole Brahma temple in the\nworld. Brahma the Creator is one of\nthe trio of main gods in the Hindu\ncanon (the other two being Shiva the\nDestroyer and Vishnu the Protector) and according to legend, he was\ncursed by his wife to only ever have\none place of worship when she found\nout he married another woman (so\nmuch for infidelity). The Brahma\ntemple is accompanied by 52 holy\nbathing ghats surrounding the lake in\nthe middle of Pushkar. Both shopping\nand site to the only Brahma temple in\nthe world made Pushkar an immensely popular tourist location.\nOne more lesser known thing about\nPushkar is that it is also the place for\npeople to experiment with bhang\nlassi. In other places, bhang lassi is\noffered discreetly, usually under the\nbanner \u2018special\u2019 lassi.\nSo me and two of my travelling\ncompanions decided to give it a shot,\nthe latter two after extensive persuasion on by a very curious me.\nOne afternoon, we checked out a\nsmall lassi shop at the corner of the\nroad. It was a simple establishment: a\nfew chairs and tables beneath a shoddy fan and a stall in front of the shop\nwhere the shopkeeper-cum-lassi-man\nmakes his lassi and sells a variety of\ncigarettes and lighters and bidi, the\ndirt-cheap joint made of leftover\ntobacco. His wife was mending to\nthe tables. Save them, the shop was\nempty.\nI asked him about bhang Lassi. He\nstarted to laugh. He spoke in Hindi\nand made gestures that I assumed to\nbe referring to getting high. In ret-rospect, I figured he was trying to\nwarn us. He went off and returned\na moment later with a green paste\nwrapped in white napkin resembling\ncheese. We sat down as the lassi-man\nwhipped out a pot of lassi and started\npreparing the magic concoction.\nThe issue that worried me most\nat that time was not the trepidation\nof trying a hallucinogen for the first\ntime in my relatively drug-free life.\nIt is legal at the place I am in, so no\nanxieties about getting busted. It was\nnot the mind-blowing effects I was\nafraid of; I think with the tales of getting high I heard from my friends, I\nwas keen on going on a trip, even if\nit\u2019s a bhang lassi trip. It was the fact\nthat the lassi-man stirred the greenish paste into the milk white lassi\nwith his bare fingers. Fingers where\nonly a moment ago I caught going up\nhis nose, dislodging boggies. But then\nthat\u2019s India. There are much worse\nthings one could do with one\u2019s hands.\nIn India, there are no tissue papers\nin toilets. Only a bucket of water. I\ntried hard not to think what else the\nlassi-man\u2019s hands touched before he\nstirred my bhang lassi.\nSo there I was seated on the table\nwith two of my travel companions,\neagerly waiting for the legendary\nlassi, praying to Brahma, Shiva and\nVishnu I do not get a nasty traveller\u2019s\ndiarrhoea from the lassi-man\u2019s finger.\nFive minutes later, a thick greenish\ndrink was placed on the table. There\nwere some unstirred paste sticking\nto the side and the lid of the cup.\nThe whole thing looked sickly (being\ngreen and milky does not help). Both\nmy friends were eyeing it reluctantly.\nNaturally, I offered them the first go\nat it. They both say no.\nI became the guinea pig. I took\nthe first swig. More of a cautious sip\nactually. Mmm! It actually tasted\ngood. It was sweet, unlike the usual\nlassi which is sour. And it had a sweet\nherbal taste to it. Good stuff, I told\nmy mates. Then they both took a sip\neach. And they told me it was all they\nwould take.\nSwallow this whole, I dare you This sure looks innocent doesn\u2019t it? Bit like the smoothie?\n\n"

In previous years, first year students have\napplied through their local education\nauthority, which worked in conjunction with the SLC to send off loan\npayments.\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF DAN WAN SPEAKS TO THREE IMPERIAL STUDENTS CAUGHT UP IN THE LOAN DELAYS\nAgnieszka Pinchinat, Peter Evans\nand Mary Harrington are three of a\nreported 116,000 students across the\ncountry that have still not received the\nfirst installment of their loans. Felix\ncaught up with each of them this week\nto explore how the SLC\u2019s failings are\nactually affecting their lives as they\nstart a new year at Imperial.\nThey have each been affected to different degrees; a contributing factor\nbeing the year of study they are each in.\nPeter seems the worst-off, being a second year student discovering the lack\nof cushion that College provides you\nwith in your Fresher year. Agnieszka\nis benefiting from being a Fresher and\nliving in halls, but sees trouble ahead\nas the financial uncertainty is added to\nP\neter is a returning Materials Engineer going into\nhis second year at Imperial. As well as stepping up\nto an increased workload, Peter\u2019s\ndealing with living out for the first\ntime. Living in private accommodation with friends means the security\nand ease of living in Halls of Residences are lost; utility bills, monthly\nrent and actually securing a habitable and affordable place are just a\nfew of many trials the majority of\n2nd years like Peter must endure.\nHowever, unlike most of his peers,\nPeter will find this shift in living arrangements much harder, owing to\nthe fact he still hasn\u2019t received his\nstudent loan.\nAs required he applied for the\nloan during the summer break, and\nwas due to receive the first term\u2019s\nworth of money on the 4th of October; a day before the academic\nyear at Imperial started. Already\nsettled into his new Chiswick flat,\nthe loan did not arrive come the\n4th of October. This has now left\nhim in a very difficult situation in\nwhich he is left desperately short of\nmoney. To make matters worse one\nof his housemates has been forced\nto move out, leaving the remaining\nresidents to plug the gap in rent that\nhas been created. Peter despairs at\nthe situation.\n\u201cI\u2019m truly screwed. I could just\nabout get away with paying my own\nrent for the next month, but won\u2019t\nbe able to pay the extra rent on time\nwithout my student loan. I have\nabout \u00a370 left for the foreseeable\nfuture.\u201d\nIt is a particular bitter situation\nfor Peter due to the fact his financial problems would not have arisen\nhad he his loan on time. He describes the money a financial \u201csafety\nnet\u201d he could rely on for emergency\ncircumstances like the one he has\nfound himself in.\nDuring our meeting, Peter once\nagain contacted the SLC to get any\nsort of timescale in which he can expect his payments to come through.\nAfter a solid 20 minutes on hold, the\nconversation with the operator lasted only a couple more. The answers\nto Peter\u2019s enquiries were obviously\nquick and well-rehearsed. His loan\napplication would be processed\nin \u201cthree to four week\u2019s time\u201d and\nwas told that applications lodged a\nmonth before his were currently being looked through.\nDespite a reported two month\nbacklog of applications, Peter\u2019s\nthree to four week delay seems fa-vourable. However, this doesn\u2019t\nmake any difference to an individual like Peter who is also reluctant\nto ask his parents for even more\nmoney than he already has.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask my Dad\nfor some more money to help me\ncover this rent, but I\u2019m ashamed to\ndo so.\u201d Despite his personal pride, it\nisn\u2019t happy days for Peter and most\nlikely plenty of other students in\nsimilar or worse situations.\nOn a last note of half-despair\nhalf-comedy, Peter mulls over what\nhe\u2019s going to be doing for the next\nfew weeks.\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m going to live out of\ntins every night, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\nW\nhen asked about her\nstudent loans, she\nreplies cheerfully,\nwith a distinct hint\nof irony.\n\u201cIt\u2019s messy!\u201d Mary exclaims. It\u2019s\ngood to see her in good spirits despite her the position the SLC has\neffectively put her in. As she sits behind the Student Activities Centre\nreception desk, she beings to explain\nthat entire situation, and the fact she\nhas been faultless at every step of the\nprocess.\nHer application hit a stumbling\nblock as soon as it started back in\nJune; well before the deadline the\nSLC set before applications become\n\u2018late.\u2019 Though the SLC prefer the\nstudents to register for their loan\nonline, Mary\u2019s mother isn\u2019t comfortable using computers for something\nso important and hence ordered the\npaper forms to be sent to her home.\nThe paper forms did not arrive before the SLC \u2018late application\u2019 deadline despite Mary\u2019s persistence on\nthe phone.\n\u201cI tried ringing 40 times in one day,\nthen another 97 times the next day.\nEvery time I was put on hold. I was\nin tears at this point.\u201d\nThe application was not only delayed past the deadline, but she\nwould not receive any level of funding when the academic year started.\nThe SLC had promised every student\nthey would receive the basic level of\nfunding as soon as their term started,\nand would receive extra loan money\nat a further date. However, this\npromise was on the condition that\nthe application had been submitted\nbefore the \u2018late application deadline\u2019.\nFurther confusion has since oc-curred. She received an email from\nthe SLC asking her to supply additional information about her family\nfinances in order to complete the ap-plication. She immediately replied in\na phone call, but was told on the con-trary. Her application was complete\nand the loan instalments were ready\nto be released.\nBoth her Local Education Authority (LEA) and the SLC now have separate applications under her name,\nbut neither are seemingly collaborating to solve her situation.\nMary isn\u2019t visibly anxious about\nher lack of money, but describes it\nas \u201cworrying.\u201d She gives off the impression that she just needs to get on\nwith things, and deal with her situation as it comes. She\u2019s happy to be\nworking part-time for the Union as\na receptionist, and the pay gets her\nby week-to-week, but nothing more.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m really lucky in the way\nthat I live cheaply. I cycle everywhere\nfor one thing. I can live off the \u00a330 a\nweek for now, but any if real expenses are needed I will begin to struggle.\nI\u2019m currently bobbing up and down\nat the bottom of my overdraft as it is.\u201d\nMary mentions she has missed out\non things in the last few months that\nshe\u2019d really like to have been involved\nwith. She decided to work over the\nperiod her girlfriends travelled to\nDublin for a holiday. She was especially feeling the effects of not having\nany money when term started.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t go to many of the Freshers\u2019 events I would have liked to go\nto. I\u2019m not going to go there to drink\nlemonade,\u201d she says as a cheeky grin\nsurfaces on her face.\nTalking about other sources of\nmoney quickly buries her smile. \u201cMy\nmum can pay my rent for now, she\u2019s\nmoved some money around to cover\nit, but I don\u2019t like asking for it.\u201d\nMary has seemingly no choice but\nto ask her mother for extra money,\nbut she realises that with six other\nchildren, her mum can only do so\nmuch for her. \u201cI take pride in being\nfinancially independent. I was the\none who chose to come to London to\na six year course. I can\u2019t expect my\nmum to support me.\u201d\nMary is looking forward to finally\ngetting her loan, although she still\nhasn\u2019t any idea when it will come\nthrough.\nAs she gets backs to sorting out\ndatabases for the hundreds of clubs\nand societies at Imperial, she has one\nlast thought.\n\u201cI have a list of things I\u2019ll get once\nmy loan comes through; a haircut\nand a couple of pairs of socks to\nname a few on it!\u201d\nthe new social and academic pressures\nshe is experiencing during her new life\nat university. Mary, on the other hand\nis a fourth year Medic, and very much\nused to living independently. She manages to contain the stresses that having\nno money creates with her experience\nshe\u2019s gained at her time at university.\nAll three of the students we spoke\nto are yet to receive any funding from\nthe SLC, and even the most prudent\nwould be struggling. There is little\nthey can actively do to solve the solve\ntheir problems in one fell-swoop. They\ncontinue to play the frustratingly slow\nwaiting game whilst it is not just their\nbank balance which is reducing: mo-rale, personal pride and quality of life\ntoo.\n\n"

Part of\nthat preparation is our Ten Long Years\nfeature, which charts the last decade of\ngaming. It\u2019s been an eventful ten years,\nand probably the decade that turned all\nof us into the gamers we are today. We\nkick off this week with the year 2000,\nalong with the chance to win some\nstuff.\nI played Halo: ODST for the first\ntime this week, and it\u2019s not bad at all.\nI\u2019ve been more impressed by the spinoff games than the core Halo series,\nweirdly enough - Halo Wars seemed\nperfectly pitched as an entry-level\nRTS, with some really clever alterations for the console, and ODST is a\nsimilarly simple, wholesome game.\nIt\u2019s not spectacular, there\u2019s not much\nto get excited about, but some aspects\nof it show some flair and creativity.\nWhich makes sense, since the franchise is being handed to all sorts of developers now, but it\u2019s clearly not being\nmilked off carelessly. And that\u2019s always\nnice to see.\nI had a discussion, as we prepared the\nTen Long Years feature, about whether\nthe Halo series was any good at all.\nSomeone said it\u2019s very generic sci-fi,\nand that seems about right. But it really comes together in its design, which\nis something that\u2019s easy to overlook\nwith a game. The weight of everything\nin the Halo universe is just so, and that\nmeans that when you start interacting\nwith it, something very generic can become much more because you\u2019re in it\nand it\u2019s as you imagined it.\nThat\u2019s what weight\u2019s about in games,\nI guess. It\u2019s nothing to do with actual\nrealism - CoD4\u2019s weapons are weighty,\nand I\u2019ve never seen a real gun that\nwasn\u2019t being held by a bemused member of the Met. Instead, it\u2019s to do with\nhow we think they should feel, how we\nimagine them feeling every time we\nwatch Die Hard or Black Hawk Down.\nSo when we get in the game and discover a match between our imagination and what we\u2019re being shown, it\ngives us a little bit of extra satisfaction.\nAnd that\u2019s what Halo is all about -being part of a generic world. ODST is\ndull at times, but really it\u2019s only if you\u2019re\nwatching. The videos and screenshots\ncan\u2019t convey what it really feels like to\nplay, and it feels like there\u2019s a battle going on that\u2019s larger than you can see. So\nwhen it comes down to it, I think Halo\nprobably is deserving of its place in the\nlast ten years of gaming. But maybe not\nfor the reasons that everyone thinks.\nGames Zero\nFun? What is\nthis, CBBC?\nC\nhrist alive, writing the\nnews is hard. So much\nbollocks happens in this\nindustry, it\u2019s hard to\nwork out what\u2019s important from what\u2019s just aimless, pointless\nnonsense spewed out by Gamespot\u2019s\nlowest of the low. The cocks over there\ngenuinely seem to consider press releases big news. Subscribing to their\nRSS must be like sitting next to a tramp\non a four-hour coach trip - every few\nminutes, you get a warble of drivel, and\nthen everything smells of piss a bit.\nAnyway, games, right? Right. I played\nLucidity today, you can find my general opinion on the whole affair to the\nright of these words. You may need to\ntravel over other words to find it, but\nit\u2019s worth it because Lucidity is fucking marvellous. Hell yes it is. How did\nyou spend your week? Playing fucking\nprop hunt on Team Fortress 2? You\nwasted your life. How does that feel,\neh? The knowledge that you could\u2019ve\nbeen playing a beautiful, well-balanced\npiece of art - yes art, you fuckers, I\u2019m\nKieron Gillen\u2019s bitch - and instead you\nwere off having fun. \u2018Fun\u2019. Woop-di-do,\nlook at you. If games were about fun,\nthen we\u2019d all be playing Crash Bandicoot and snorting sherbert dip-dabs.\nActually don\u2019t do that, you get a\nnosebleed.\nAnyway, assuming you\u2019re too cretinous to actually play such a magnificent\ngame, the least you can do is go and\nmake generally approving noises in\nthe direction of LucasArts, whose back\ncatalog on Steam continues to amaze\nme.\nNext week - Mirror\u2019s Edge, and why\nfailing constantly is part of growing up\nand becoming a man you whiny fucks.\nMichaelCook\nMichaelCook\nGames Hero\nTen Long Years - 2000\nI\nt\u2019s the Year 2000. Approximately\nno-one is using Steam, the Internet is still a confusing realm of\ndrugs and nerds as far as the media are concerned, and you\u2019re still in\nsecondary school (actually, the thought\nthat some of you may have been in primary school has just occurred to me - I\ndon\u2019t like that thought).\nBut what a year for games! Good lord.\nSo as this decade winds down in an\norgy of good games releases, we\u2019re going to flick back one year per week with\nsome thoughts on the best and worst\nthe year had to offer. We also want\nyour thoughts each week, so if you\u2019ve\ngot some memories of what you were\nplaying in 2001 (penis jokes notwith-standing) drop us an email at games.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk. This week, we\u2019ll\nbe giving away a free game from Good\nOld Games to one lucky entrant, so\nmake sure you\u2019ve sent something over\nby midday on Monday 19th October.\n2000 can only ever mean one thing to\nme - The Sims. Not because I played\nit a hell of a lot, but because it was so\nvastly different to all that had gone\nbefore. Yes, I did the delete-the-swim-ming-pool-exit thing that everyone\nsays they did like they\u2019re some kind of\ninventive genius,\nbut that wasn\u2019t\nthe main thing.\nYou could\nbuild elaborate\nhouses. You\ncould make\nyour friends\nkiss each other\nin ways you\nwould later\nfind extremely uncomfortable to\nwatch.\nThe\nnice thing\nabout\nThe Sims\nis that\nit\u2019s a real\ngame. You\nknow, a\ngenu-ine,\nbona fide, would-you-like-to-have-fun\nkind of game. There\u2019s honestly very\nlittle challenge, even if you play by\nthe almost nonexistent rulebook, and\nit\u2019s a good way to start off a decade in\ngames that was all about drawing in\nthe outsider. The Sims was where that\nall began.\nIt was also the year of Perfect Dark,\nthe slick first-person shooter that had\na brief spell of domination on the N64.\nOne reader reminisces; \u201cPerfect is\nright, this game was sublime. If you\ndidn\u2019t play it at the time then you probably won\u2019t enjoy it now but back then\neverything about it was incredible; the\ngraphics, the guns, the gadgets, the\nAI, the voiceacting, even the plot was\npretty damn good! In a shoot-em-up!\nWhat they managed to achieve and\nsqueeze out of my dear little black box\nis frankly incredible. Goldeneye was an\nimpossibly tough act to follow for Rare,\nbut hot diggity f**k, they only went and\ndid it anyway.\u201d\nIt was also the year of the PlayStation2 launch, the beginning of one of\nthe most infamous reigns in console\nhistory that would last for years (and\nis still arguably continuing today).\nMany will have fond memories of the\none bastard they knew that bought\none at launch (if it was you - you\u2019re a\nbastard, you bastard) and probably\nhaving a bash at Tekken Tag Tournament, staring in disbelief at visuals that\nwould soon become dated and blocky.\nSign of the times, et cetera.\nAs one behemoth arises, another falls\n- Looking Glass Studios collapsed\nthis year, despite releasing the sublime\nThief 2, a game which many cherish to\nthis day. As if that wasn\u2019t enough for\nPC Gamers, this was also the year of\nboth Deus Ex and Diablo 2, making a\ntrio of games that still stand up today\nas great pieces of entertainment.\n\u201cBefore this I had been playing a\nfairly awful chat-based browser type\nDiablo thing called \u2018Vagabonds Quest\u2019\nin which you pick a character, level it\nup by fighting fellow chatters and buy\nmore gear. It was thrilling to me.\n\u201cThen I got my paws on Diablo II and\nmy mind was blown. It was exactly the\nsort of game I\u2019d always wanted to play,\nWitharoundtenweeksoffelixleftthisdecade,andtenyearsofgaming\ntolookbackon,joinusaswereminisce(andwinafreegame,too)\nand good lord did I put some hours\ninto it.\u201d\nFor those of you who\u2019ve not had a\nchance to play it - this game that\u2019s now\nvery long in the tooth indeed is still\nplayed by tens of thousands of people\nevery day, on Blizzard\u2019s online server\nnetwork. It\u2019s a stunningly enduring\ngame, whose sequel will have to work\nvery hard to impress and outlast it.\nAnother key release in this year,\nquite quietly across the pond in North\nAmerica, was the demure point-and-click adventure game The Longest\nJourney. Heralded by many to be the\nfinest game of its kind, TLJ was destined to remain a cult classic from its\nrelease, a brave stab at truly story-led\nadventuring in a decade that was to\nbegin to shift its mainstream ways towards action, guns and more action.\nIts sequel, Dreamfall, captivated a\nsmall audience in much the same way,\nand the team that worked on both, led\nby the inspirationally creative Ragnar\nTornqist, is to launch an MMO next\nyear with a similar feel. It\u2019s certainly a\ndevelopment team that were precise in\nevery release they made.\nNext week - 2001, Final Fantasies,\ngruff noir detectics and Uri Geller.\nDon\u2019t forget - send your thoughts in\nto games.felix@imperial.ac.uk for a\nchance to win a game from GoG.com!\nSee you next year.\nAngryGeek\nAngryGeek\n\n"

    "content": "31\nfelix FRIDAY 16 OCTOBER 2009\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk TRAVEL\nI eyed the remaining bhang lassi. It\nwas still almost touching the brim. It\nwas me who suggested we try that after all, so the responsibility to finish it\nrested upon me. I held my breath and\ngulped it down.\nAnd then we sat there for a while\nwaiting for the high to kick in. One\nminute passed. Still sane. Two min-utes. I cracked a joke. No one laughed\nbut me. Three minutes. I looked at my\nmates. They looked back at me. No\none was high. After a while we decided that it was a farce, bhang lassi was\nover-hyped. We left the shop 50 rupees poorer without any form of high.\nEmbarrassingly, I have to admit,\neven more so due to the fact that I am\na biologist, I overlooked something\nfundamental about consuming consumables of any kind \u2013 it takes time\nto go through the extensive human\ngut tract. I had forgotten the fact that\nusually weed is inhaled and cocaine\nis snorted, hence the almost instant\nkick. I drank a cup of marijuana lassi.\nIt takes time to get through my stomach and reach my small intestines,\nbefore being absorbed into my bloodstream by the numerous villi on the\nwall of the intestine.\nIt is then transported all the way\nback up to my brain and nervous sys-tem. It\u2019s a bit of a big round the way\ntrip.\nSo there I was wondering around\nPushkar with a ticking chemical time\nbomb in my body.\nIt wasn\u2019t until when I was visiting\nthe Brahma temple and having myself blessed at one of the nearby holy\nbathing ghats that bhang lassi came\nknocking onto my senses. And it\nwasn\u2019t just a gentle knock.\nIt started with my eyelids getting\nnumb. At that time a young \u2018priest\u2019\napprentice clad in jeans and T-shirt\nwas bringing me around the Brahma\ntemple, hastily explaining the important sights in the place. The pot of\ngold in form of USD tips at the end\nof the \u2018tour\u2019 is something he blatantly\nlooked forward to.\nTo conclude the tour, I was given\na pink flower and brought to one of\nthe nearby holy bathing pools. It was\nthe usual route for tourists \u2013 visit the\nBrahma temple, say your prayers and\nprostate before the statue of Brahma,\nthen bring an offering in form of flower to one of the holy pool nearby, then\nstruggle with US Dollar-demanding\npriests who moments ago seem like\nthe friendliest man on earth. I was at\nthe stone steps of the holy pools when\nthe bhang lassi effects got stronger\nand \u2013 to quote Keats \u2013 a drowsy\nnumbness pains my sense.\nWhat followed was the bhang lassi\neffect in full blast. And it chose the\nbest time to kick in. The dodgy priest\nwas in the midst of giving me a blessing in English and making me recite\nit. But things got fuzzy and blurry.\nFrom what I hear from my mates, it\nseems that I started laughing as the\npriest was chanting away.\nAfter the \u2018blessing\u2019 and a pissed\npriest, I was stumbling. But the entire time I was still laughing. I walked\nwith my mates for a few streets until it was too much for me to bear. I\ntold them to go ahead without me \u2013\nI needed to get back to the hostel. I\nassured them I could do it myself.\nMale ego still reigns amidst drugged\nstupor.\nWhich proved to be a silly mistake.\nNow the bhang effect got beyond tickling my funny bones. It was knocking me out. I could no longer distinguish faces, my swagger resembled a\ndrunken crab and reality started to\ncrumble. I managed to find my way\nthough and even took a few snapshots\nof passing camels.\nWhen I arrived at my hostel, I collapsed on the couch at the reception.\nI was too groggy to move further. I\nwas there for a while, drifting in and\nout of consciousness and could barely\nhear the staff laughing at my drunken\nstate. Then one of them took my by\nmy arms and brought me up to my\nroom.\nOnce I was on my bed things got\nweird. And surreal. Memories of the\nlast few hours replayed themselves in\nmy head, and it all felt like a dream.\nUntil I woke up sweaty and incapacitated on my hostel bed. I felt like I\nhad woken up in a dream.\nAs usual, India had a knack of rubbing things in my face. Of all times to\nchoose, the hostel had electricity cut\nfor the few hours when my mind was\nwedged somewhere between real and\nsurreal. So, I awoke alone in a dark\nroom with the door slightly ajar, revealing a dark hallway with noises\ncoming from it. It would have been\nokay normally. But when your mind\nis playing tricks on you, it was creepy\nshit.\nI spent the remainder of the night\nlapsing into a living dream, only\nwaking up again when my friends\ndropped by my room to visit. One\ntook my temperature (I thought it was\nextremely surreal he brought a thermometer on this trip\u2026) and the other\ncame in and said \u201che\u2019s really fucked\u201d.\nI missed dinner and slept all the way\ntill the morning.\nThe next morning, I woke up after\n12 hours on the bed. I was expecting\na bad hangover after such a delirious\nexperience the night before. I blinked\na few times. Eyelids not numb any-more. Stood up and took a few steps\naround my bed. Coordination seems\nokay. I am back to normal. I sat on my\nbed and took a few relieved breaths.\nChecked my belongings: passport still\nin pocket, wallet still stuffed with rupees and DSLR still intact. That was\npretty good seeing how unhinged I\nwas yesterday.\nGrabbing my Lonely Planet India\nfrom my backpack, I flipped through\nthe index to search about bhang las-si. Towards the end of the 1043 page\ntome, there is a section about general\nsafety. In that section there is a small\nhighlighted text box at the corner:\n\u201ccaution about bhang\u2026a highly potent derivative of cannabis\u2026 endeavour at your own risk\u2026some travellers\nfind themselves experiencing bouts of\ndelirium and become bedridden for\nas long as three days\u2026\u201d\nI guess I was pretty lucky to be\nfucked up for only one night.\nOr would you trust that hand?\nWould you trust that hand?\n\n"

    "content": "13\nfelix FRIDAY 16 OCTOBER 2009\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk SCIENCE\nIs Darwin\u2019s theory just that, a theory?\nIs evolution just a theory? \u201cIf you don\u2019t\nknow the answer to that question I do\nnot want to talk to you.\u201d says Professor\nLande, an evolutionary biologist at Imperial College London. His attitude reflects views of many bwiologists tired\nof having to re-affirm the very basis of\ntheir field of study every time they talk\nto non-experts. Although evolutionary\ntheory has been the overarching paradigm uniting all fields of biology since\nDarwin, there are still those who not\nonly do not accept it but claim that it\nis not true.\nThis year has seen unprecedented\ncelebrations of the 200th anniversary\nof Charles Darwin\u2019s birth and 150th\nanniversary of the publication of his\nrevolutionary book \u201cOn the Origin\nof Species\u201d. Newsstands were packed\nwith magazines carrying cover stories\nabout Darwin and his theory of evolution by natural selection; museums\nand universities organised exhibitions\nand events dedicated to the great\nman, the founder of modern biology.\nTo an innocent bystander a lot of it\ncould have appeared to be a sort of\ndefensive response by the scientific\ncommunity and their spokespeople,\nthe science writers, to a growing public unawareness of what Darwinian\nevolution is and hence to growing acceptance of alternative, non-scientific\ntheories of origin and evolution of life\non Earth. Perhaps the scariest variant\nof this, at least to a scientist\u2019s rational\nmind, is the Intelligent Design, an attempt to justify scientifically literal\ncreationist understanding of the Bible\nand its say about how and when life\non Earth started. Theory of evolution\nwas often featured in the media a few\nyears before the anniversary, but it\nwas usually in relation to Intelligent\nDesign.\nBut the fundamental difference between Darwin\u2019s theory and creationism is that Darwin did not actually illuminate how life started. Darwin only\nexplained how, once started, life could\nhave evolved over millions of years. He\ncalled this mechanism of evolution and\ndiversification of species the natural se-lection. And biologists today still relate\nto Darwin\u2019s theory as they work within\nthe understanding that evolution did\nindeed happen in much the same way\nSmart Second Skin: the intelligent dress that releases scents to match your mood\nMicoTatalovic\nMicoTatalovic Science Reporter\n\u201cDarwin did not\nactually shed light\nonto the origin of\nspecies.\u201d\nas Darwin envisaged. Albert Phillimore, an evolutionary biologist from\nImperial College London says \u201cDarwin\u2019s insights into evolution through\nnatural selection are fundamental to\nmy work... Famously, however, Darwin did not actually shed light onto the\norigin of species. We still don\u2019t actually\nknow exactly how important natural\nselection as a driver of the speciation\nprocess.\u201d\nOthers still work to prove or disprove\nsome of controversial and uncertain\npredictions from Darwin\u2019s theory. Vincent Savolaien, another biologist from\nImperial College London explains how\nDarwin relates to his work: \u201cDarwin\nwrote about the origin of species without geographic isolation - a controversial topic called \u2018sympatric speciation\u2019.\nIt has been debated for two centuries,\nand I published the most convincing\ncase of sympatric speciation so far,\nlooking at two species of palm trees on\na remote oceanic island.\u201d\nBut although both of these biologists acknowledge that Darwin didn\u2019t\nexplain how life originated, and that\nthere are still facets of his theory that\nThe evolution of man from the point of view of Games editor, Mike Cook.......\noh burn!\nneed testing, they agree on one thing:\nevolution is not just a theory, it\u2019s a fact.\nThey are less shy then professor Lande\nto explain why this is so. Phillimore\nsays that \u201cEvolution is to all intents\nand purposes a fact. Minor nuances\nof the evolutionary process may be\nrevised as we learn more but Darwin\u2019s\ninsights into the role of natural selection in driving evolution will not. Jerry\nCoyne excellent book entitled \u2018Why\nEvolution is True\u2019 marshals all of the\noverwhelming body of evidence for\nevolution.\u201d Savolaien agree with him\nstating that \u201cmany facts prove evolution happens, such as the evolution\nof diseases and emergence of new\nviruses\u201d.\nTim Coulson, a biologist at Imperial\nCollege London, knows evolution is a\nfact because he watches it happen. \u201cI\ncan watch evolution occurring in bacteria in my lab: over a period of weeks\nthey adapt to changes in culture me-dium. Similarly, I can show that natural selection - the theory for explaining\nadaptation - has occurred.\u201d\nBut he is wary of suggesting that we\nknow exactly how it happens over millions of years: \u201cExtrapolating to longer\ntime periods can be harder, for example understanding how species diverge\nover millions of years, because we can\u2019t\nwatch what happens in a human life-time. However, we can make hypotheses about what has happened and\nthen find evidence that supports those\neither using fossil or DNA sequence\nevidence.\u201d\nNevertheless, Coulson denies absolute certainty to our knowledge of\nevolution, but he wouldn\u2019t expect it\nto be wrong any more than he would\nexpect an apple not to fall off the tree.\nHe says: \u201cEvolution is an active science with many unsolved questions\nand indeed new questions to be dis-covered, but the evidence for evolution even over long timescales is as\nrobust as, for example, for planetary\nmotion, gravity and the expansion of\nthe universe.\u201d\nSo it appears that biologists at Imperial College are pretty sure that evolution is a fact. They watch it happen on\ndaily basis and most are happy to share\nthat information with the rest of us.\nOthers, like Professor Lande, are more\nreserved about talking to people on\nwhether evolution is a fact or a theory.\nBut can we really blame him? Would\nany physicists be willing to talk to us\nif we approached them with a question\n\u201cIs gravity just a theory?\u201d So, I go back\nto Professor Lande and explain that I\nknow the answer to the controversial\nquestion, but would like to hear his\nopinion on it. Unconvinced, he promises to grant me another interview that\nwill start with him asking me a question and only proceed if I answer this\nto his satisfaction: \u201cIs evolution just a\ntheory?\u201d\nMicoTatalovic\nMicoTatalovic Science Reporter\nYou are driving to work in the morning and a gentle scent of citrus fruits\nis keeping you alert. There\u2019s a fly in\nthe car, but before its buzzing starts\nto annoy you the tiny sensor on your\ncuff button detects and zaps it with a\ntargeted amount of insecticide. You\nget into the office and you smell great\n\u2013 that new perfume you downloaded\nfrom the web is really doing it for you.\nBut after a stressful meeting the tiny\nbiosensors in you clothes are detecting that you need to relax so a calming\nlavender aroma instantly fills your personal scent bubble.\nThis may sound like science fiction,\nbut a handful of enthusiasts have been\nworking quietly on this nascent tech-nology. One of them is Jenny Tillotson,\na researcher and a designer at the University of the Arts in London, UK.\nTillotson produced the world\u2019s first\ninteractive scent outfit as part of her\nPhD in emerging textile technologies.\nShe called her prototype dress Smart\nSecond Skin: \u2018smart\u2019 because it senses\nthe wearer\u2019s mood; \u2018second skin\u2019 because it interacts with the wearer and\ntheir environment, extending the skin\nas our interface with the environment.\nSmart Second Skin combines emerging lab-on-chip technology with\nminiature bio-sensors. Lab-on-chip\nallows the storage and handling of\ntiny amounts of fluids on small chips.\nThese chips can be programmed to release specific scents at specific times.\n\u201cJust as people store different genres\nof music on their iPods, this method\noffers a new sensory system to collect and store a selection of fragrances\nclose to the body: a modern iPod of\nthe fragrance industry embedded in\nfashion\u201d Tillotson says but adds, \u201cI\nam more interested in health aspects\nlinked to Aromachology, the science of\nfragrance, rather than just a gimmicky\nscent delivery system that substitutes\nthe perfume bottle.\u201d\nTillotson\u2019s newest gadget is the but-ton-sized eScent. It contains bio-sen-sors that monitor changes in the blood\npressure, respiration and skin\u2019s electric\npotential. When they detect a change\nthey send signals to the lab-on-chip\ndevices, which then change the type or\nintensity of fragrance released. eScent\ndetects mood changes such as stress or\nanxiety build-up and controls them by\nreleasing appropriate scents to soothe\nthe wearer.\nThere is ample data to show that\nthere is a \u201cdirect link between the sense\nof smell and human health and wellbeing\u201d says Tillotson. \u201c75% of the emotions that we generate on a daily basis\nare affected by smell. Certain odours\ncan also relieve side effects from chem-otherapy, or significantly benefit people who suffer from insomnia, muscle\nstiffness, bronchitis, poor concentra-tion, indigestion, and high-blood pres-sure. So eScent could help maintain a\ngood mood by releasing, for example,\nlavender or rose scent to increase relaxation or jasmine and citrus scent\nto avoid depression, when the system\nsenses that person is getting stressed\nor anxious\u201d. Tillotson is currently planning an exhibition for the Institute of\nPsychiatry in London, UK, as \u201cThey\nfelt that many of their patients would\nbenefit from stress-reducing clothes.\u201d\nAnother application of this interactive scent delivery system is eMos, a\nminiature gadget which senses the\nsound frequency of a flying mosquito\napproaching the skin and then triggers\nthe emission of a small amount of insect repellent. This targeted, localised\nrelease of insect repellent avoids the\nneed to apply large quantities of the\nchemicals onto our skin. It also reduces environmental effect of such chemi-cals. Tillotson says eScent and eMos\nwill be on the market within the next\nfive years.\nJoseph Kaye, an IT researcher from\nCornell University, is sceptical about\nmost existing applications of computerised scent technology. \u201cA lot of the current technology is a solution looking for\na problem,\u201d he says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t figured\nout exactly the right applications for it\nyet. I think there are astonishing things\nwe could do with the technology but I\ndon\u2019t think we have a good handle on\nwhat those actually are yet.\u201d\nKaye designed \u201cDollars & Scents\u201d\ndevice that proved popular with the\nfinancial workers who would smell\na mint if the market was up that day,\nor lemon if the market had gone sour.\nHis \u201cHoney I\u2019m Home\u201d transmits scent\nto the loved one, subtly letting them\nknow you are thinking about them,\nwithout interrupting their work with a\nphone call. This idea of using scent for\nconveying intimacy at a distance could\nbe the way forward. Tillotson is creating a personalised scent bubble that\ncould convey romantic and even sexual\ninformation to others.\n\u201cOne area that looks promising is\nTillotson\u2019s work,\u201d says Kaye. \u201cThis is for\na simple reason, that people do wear\nscents so there is a real potential there\nif that can be incorporated more into\neveryday life.\u201d\nSmart Second Skin interacts with the\nwearer to produce scents appropriate\nto their mood and environment\n\n"

It was\na new start-up called FindInvestGrow, or FIG, which\noffers a completely unique\nand exciting service. If this article is\nbeginning to sound like the ones we\nget paid to write, mostly for big City\nrecruiters, it is not \u2013 they really are this\nawesome. The best thing about them\nis that they seem to do everything exactly how you would think it should\nbe done. Investors make money from\npeople pitching ideas to them, so it is\nstrange that they make themselves so\ninaccessible. FIG allows entrepreneurs\nto develop their business plan online\nusing a unique step-by-step method.\nIf there are specific weaknesses, they\nhelp resolve them. The process swiftly\nidentifies those ideas that deserve no\nmore of their pursuer\u2019s time. It also\nallows good concepts to develop further through supporting events such\nas workshops, until they are ready to\nbe pitched to investors. These are people hand-picked by FIG to understand\nwhere student start-ups are coming\nfrom and not screw them over.\nAt first the company seemed to have\nquestion marks hanging over them.\nWalking along Princes\u2019 Gardens to\nmeet them at the new Eastside restaurant on a brisk Monday morning, I had\na sense that this would or would not\ngo well. I was certainly not surprised to\nmeet a pair of highly impressive figures\nwith a clear and strong vision of where\nthey were and where they wanted their\nbusinesses to go. But I was also prepared for an offer of a free London flat\nas long as I first sent the key deposit to\nits Nigerian clergyman owner.\nMy suspicions about the company\nwere based on them sounding so good.\nSince a certain US presidential campaign in 2008 I\u2019m not too surprised\nto see big things not well covered by\nmainstream media, but this seemed\nexceptional even for them. So I asked\nabout it, earning the decisive answer\n\u201cbecause we\u2019ve only been doing this\nfor three weeks.\u201d We can be fairly sure\nof seeing and hearing a lot more about\nthem in the coming months.\nFIG offers a broad mix of services to\nsupport would-be student entrepreneurs with great ideas and potential,\nbut not much else. They have partnerships with everyone from patent lawyers to design specialists, selected to\nreduce the risk of new start-ups losing\nout to unscrupulous suppliers for want\nof experience. They seem to have really thought this through.\nI suggested we meet at Eastside\nthinking the place was an example of\nuniversities taking students more seriously and trying to nurture creativ-ity. It turned out to be an appropriate\nvenue for a different reason. James\nKing, FIG\u2019s founder, was surprised at\nhow expensive everything was. \u201cStudents are not the people to be milking,\u201d he complained. This understanding of student poverty combined with\nan underdeveloped sense of the value\nof money was further shown when\nA new start-up is exciting entrepreneurs on campuses across the country. Business Editor Sina Ataherian\ninterviews its founder James King, and its biggest success story: SpineStrength\u2019s Doug Higgins\nWe often hear that recessions are a\ngreat time to start a business. FIG was\nmore realistic about this, suggesting it\nmay be a mixed bag.\n\u201cHard times force you to do things\ndifferently, so investors are going to\nbe more open-minded, and it will be\neasier to talk to them,\u201d Mr King noted.\nOn the other hand, many companies\nand individuals have less money to in-vest. This should not be accepted as a\nblanket excuse, however, \u201cwe actually\nturned down someone who wanted to\nbe a FIGurehead for that reason.\nAnother FIGurehead pointed out\nsomething he had said, which was un-acceptable. Remember these people\nare all high net worth individuals. If\nthey tell you they are doing badly, they\nprobably still have at least \u00a310 million\nin the bank. Or even \u00a31 million; its way\nmore than you need.\u201d\nSo the lesson is to use the recession\nto your advantage. You can often claim\ndiscounts because of it, but you should\nnot afford the same opportunity to\nothers.\nOne of Mr King\u2019s friends got \u00a3700\nWimbledon tickets for \u00a3250 using\nthe \u2018times are tough\u2019 argument. At\nthe same time, he has seen many\ninvestors try to gain larger equity for their investment using the\nsame line, but climb down against\ndetermined negotiation from the\nentrepreneur.\ninterview and found many more people with an interest in starting their\nown business than we expected. Three\nissues repeatedly came up: whether\nthis is a good time to get started, how\nan idea can be developed and protected at the same time, and what to\ndo and avoid in order to maximise the\nchance of success.\nA great idea is the most important\nthing that FIG looks for. Other than\nthis, Mr King recommends thorough\nresearch, \u201cyou\u2019re all students; you\nshould know how to research. If someone comes and says \u2018I think this [piece\nof gym equipment] will support the\nback because I think it will,\u2019 that\u2019s different from \u2018I\u2019ve done all this research\nand it points to...\u2019 Know your market\nand your product.\u201d\nHe would not name the most comical evaders of this rule, but said, \u201cI\u2019ve\nhad seven people phone up and say\nthey want to start up look-alike agencies because \u2018my friends all think I\nlook like a celebrity.\u2019 I just tell them ok,\ngoogle \u2018celebrity look-alike agency\u2019.\u201d\nAnother thing to avoid is phoning up\nto pitch an idea. The website makes the\nprocess extremely clear and straight-forward, \u201cbut they still phone up and\nwell, I\u2019ll listen to what they have to say\nbut that tells me immediately that they\nhave not looked at the website.\u201d\nAnother piece of advice was \u201cI am\nso pleased when people tell me they\nwould like to set up a business but are\ngoing to wait until they have a good\nidea...don\u2019t just say \u2018I\u2019m going to do my\nown thing, and I\u2019ll think about what it\nis later.\u201d And if you have no good ideas\nyet? \u201cClubs and societies are a good\nplace. I know here Imperial entrepreneurs is quality but also...sports clubs,\nethnic societies...anywhere good ideas\nhe talked about expensive campus\nsocieties.\nThis is also how he views his busi-ness. Clearly there are substantial costs\ninvolved in starting a new venture\nand seeing it through its early growth\nphase before it becomes profitable.\nFIG believes that these should, as far as\npossible, be taken on by the investors.\nAs Mr. King put it, \u201cso who would you\ncharge - the rich investor whose got all\nthe money or the student who is just\ntrying to keep the idea going?\u201d\nFIG went live this September and\nis already supporting seven promising student-led enterprises (it was six\nwhen I first wrote this sentence and\nmay be more before this paper gets\nout).\nThe most successful so far is\nSpineStrength, founded by Doug Higgins, a former rugby captain here at\nImperial.\nHis product is an ingenious piece of\nOpportunities in Recession\ngym equipment that allows development of neck and lower back muscles,\nwhich are needed during scrummag-ing. He came up with the idea as a\nmechanical engineering student, when\nhe injured himself and found nothing\nin the gym to help his rehabilitation.\nWhat started as an undergraduate design project has now been taken on by\ngyms and sports coaches across the\ncountry as way to allow athletes to reduce training-related injuries.\nFIG is growing fast. Mr King has an\nopen mind about whether they will\ncover student enterprise abroad before other types of start-up at home.\nGiven the intricate understanding of\nthe company of the unique challenges\nfaced by student entrepreneurs, this\nseems likely. Less than a month after\nbeginning to get the word out, they\nhave already been approached by companies from across Europe, the USA\nand the Middle East.\nFIG clearly has huge potential, but\nthis does not always translate to tangible results. Doug Higgins has come to\nknow their value as well as their limitations better than anyone. \u201cWithout\nFIG I would not have raised the money.\nNo question about it; just would not\nhave happened. James got me talking\nto all the people I needed to talk to\nand now here we are.\u201d I suspect he may\nwell have got the money anyway, but\nit sounds like FIG made the process\nmuch smoother.\nfelix went around campus before the\nAdvice from the Top\nPitfalls of Patents\nIssues surrounding intellectual property also cause some aspiring entrepreneurs to delay starting their company.\nIt is important to remember that ideas\ncannot go anywhere if they are never\nshared with anyone. \u201cIdeas are two a\npenny. It\u2019s not the idea that is worth\nmoney, it\u2019s all the thinking around\nit,\u201d advises Mr King. It is important\nto discuss concepts with experienced\nprofessionals, likely consumers, and\nothers who can help before basing a\nbusiness on them.\nThere is also a warning about IP law\nfirms. FIG works with IP21 because\nthey have provided them with a consistent service and because the firm\ncaps its own fees. Many law firms will\nnot, since it is easy to enter open-end-ed contracts were they continually ask\nfor more money.\nare discussed.\u201d\nI ended the interview by asking Doug\nhow he would advocate FIG to entrepreneurial friends back at Imperial.\n\u201cLook at their success. I think you just\nhave to look at what they have done.\nThat is their biggest selling point.\u201d\nThe company has already acquired\noffice space in Marylebone to offer\nfor free to its entrepreneurs. They also\nplan to roll out other benefits such as\nfree gym membership cards by Christmas. They may be expected to set up\na foundation for that, to benefit from\ncharitable status. But yet again Mr\nKing showed his excellent eye for business opportunities by pointing out\n\u201cthere are benefits to running this as\npart of our company, like sponsorship\nand other partnership opportunities.\u201d\nHe may well be able to profit from giving people things for free.\nFIG is growing fast in part because\nthey are open to different ways of\nimproving. Unlike any venture capital firms that you are likely to come\nacross, they welcome suggestions from\nall quarters. As their target clients, students are encouraged to contact them\ndirectly if they have any ideas about\nhow they can continue to develop and\nimprove as a company.\nAs former Imperial students, both\nDoug Higgins\u2019 and James King\u2019s stories should inspire anyone here who\nhas good ideas floating around their\nmind alongside doubts as to whether they can really put in all the hard\nwork. There is no down side to getting\nstarted. Since FIG\u2019s business model is\ngeared towards sharing the profits of\nsuccess rather than providing expensive services to likely failures, they will\ngive an honest, impartial and objective\naccount of how good your idea is. You\nnever know; Doug was probably not\nalways sure that he would be running a\nmillion pound company today.\n\n"

Due to its size it does\nnot hold a permanent collec-tion, but has regular exhibitions of contemporary artists\n(also known as YBA\u2019s) such\nas the controversial Chapman brothers and the experimental Marc Quinn.\nPiccadilly or Green Park\nSmaller Greats\nNational Portrait Gallery:\nSlightly dwarfed by the National Gallery, the National\nPortrait Gallery features\nworks only of people (you\nwon\u2019t find any landscapes\nhere). There is a permanent\ncollection upstairs which\nis free and the ground floor\nhosts a temporary exhibition\nwhich is almost always in the\nTop 20 London exhibitions.\nCharing Cross\nWellcome Collection:\nHenry Wellcome, medic, ex-plorer, philanthropist, has\nhis collection of weird and\nwonderful discoveries accumulated during his years\ntraveling the world exhibited here. Includes chastity\nbelts, human tattoos (yes,\ntorn clean off their person)\nand Hieronymous Bosch\u2019s famous painting The Garden of\nEarthly Delights. Downstairs\nare always several fantastic\nexhibitions, usually with scientific or medical leanings,\ngiven Wellcome\u2019s status as a\ndoctor. Adjoined is a small\nWaterstone\u2019s and a Peyton\nand Byrne caf\u00e9 which must\nsurely serve the best cakes in\nLondon. Euston\nRoyal Academy of Arts:\nThe height of academic artistic excellence was to be\nfound at this establishment\nunder Sir Joshua Reynolds in\nthe eighteenth-century (a bit\nlike Imperial\u2019s scientists). Today, this privately-led institution holds regular retrospective exhibitions of the greats,\nincluding Van Gogh and J.\nW. Waterhouse among oth-ers. The highlight of the year\nfor fans of this establishment\nis the Summer Exhibition,\nwhich takes place in its larger\ngalleries and showcases talent selected from over 10,000\napplicants \u2013 from amateurs\nto Royal Academicians, such\nas Tracey Emin. Entrance\nto exhibits normally costs\naround 7GBP concession.\nGreen Park or Piccadilly\nCourtauld Gallery:\nThis relatively small gallery is\nby no means minor in its col-lection. It is home to a permanent group of artworks by\nsome of the most influential\nartists of the nineteenth and\ntwentieth centuries, including Edouard Manet, Paul\nGauguin and Matisse. There\nare also regular temporary\nexhibitions, with a number of\ntalks and educational discus-sions, as the gallery is partnered with the Courtauld\nInstitute \u2013 a prestigious and\nexclusive establishment at\nwhich to study the history of\nart. Somerset House is a fantastic building, with many of\nits own events, including a\nbeautiful outdoor ice rink for\nthe winter.

It came to our\nattention, following the first edition of\nfelix this year, that an individual was\nindignant at the lack of an arts sec-tion. We apologise for this oversight\nand hope that from this issue onwards,\nwe can provide you with an extensive\ncoverage of events that London (and\nbeyond) have to offer. The city you\nnow find yourselves a resident of can\nLatterday Saints, myths and Rankers\nT\nhis article is about por-traits, manifested in their\nphysical form, and also\nabout identity, those \u2018portraits\u2019 that communicate\nbeyond their frame.\nThis time of the year situates a\nlargely charged atmosphere for those\nbeginning a new academic annum \u2013 at\nuniversity, college or school. We are\nenrolled within a structure that nurtures our pursuit of personal great-ness. I am sure you, as I, have had that\nintroductory conversation that will either enthrall or petrify you as to what\npossibilities lie ahead. How we record\nsuch a period of \u2018self-exploration\u2019 is\ncommonplace among the Facebook\nphoto albums and dormitory walls of\nany educational establishment\u2019s residential quarters. Yet in the past, when\ndisposable, instantly accessible images\nwere few and far between, the \u2018portrait\u2019\n,\nif not as abundant, was as readily cherished as those thousands of \u2018portraits\u2019\nwe have of ourselves and our friends\ntoday.\nThe two exhibitions which I posit\nunder review, are Francis Al\u00ffs\u2019 collection of Fabiola portraits at the National\nPortrait Gallery and Rankin\u2019s Rankin\nLive and Retrospective exhibition\nwhich took place at the Truman Brewery in Shoreditch. A personal encounter with the artist Rankin has led to my\ngrappling with how to frame and portray the exhibition critically.\nHowever, after debating inflection\nin my tone towards this article, I will\ncome to expose these observed nuances and site them within the contemporary criticisms of art.\nIn today\u2019s society, those who are most\nfastidiously reproduced in \u2018portraits\u2019 of\nthemselves, are those we name \u2018celebrities\u2019. In fact, the origin of the word\ncomes from the Latin \u2018celebritas\u2019, from\n\u2018celeber\u2019, meaning frequented or hon-oured. The example of Francis Al\u00ffs\u2019\ncollection of Fabiola portraits, currently on show at the National Portrait\ngallery serves to elaborate this point in\na historical sense. Al\u00ffs, in search of a\ncollection across the world, found Fabiola in a repeated singular image from\nantique shops to flea markets. This\nLatter-day Saint has been \u2018honoured\u2019\npainstakingly by hundreds of amateur\nartists who wished to possess her portrait for their own.\nTurning to an alternative facet of ce-lebrity: that of the immortalisation of\nan individual through their portrait,\nwhich incidentally allows us as voyeurs\nto dissect and criticize openly and at\nlength, without the depicted present\nphysically to defend themselves.\nRankin\u2019s portraits do just this. They\nsexualize, fetishize and glorify each sitter in the manner of the contemporary\n\u2018glamourising\u2019 of individuals through\nposes, setting and above all infamy.\nThis voyeurism was exploited in the\nset-up of the exhibition \u2013 a partition wall\nwas all that separated the public from\nthe artist and his \u201cRankers\u201d \u2013 individuals who had made an application to be\nshot and contribute their portrait to the\nwalls of the exhibition. The positioning\nof this small studio was fascinating to\nobserve as a microcosm of the production of Rankin\u2019s work. It was possibly the\nfeature that I appreciated most about the\nexhibition \u2013 lifting it above and beyond\nthe static of the white cube.\nThe reek of celebrity was in the air\n\u2013 that intense pressure and tension\nthat surrounds the protagonist himself\n\u2013 a vaporous mist of myth emanating\nthrough the vacuous individuals that\ndrift about him, looking disdainfully at\nthe \u2018public\u2019, yet jealously guarding their\nair space with him. I cannot help expressing the environment in this way,\nas an onlooker, a mere anthropologist,\nit was a fantastic challenge trying to see\nthe artworks objectively through the\ngloss of celebrity. From models such as\nKate Moss to any actor half worth their\nsalt, Rankin has photographed many\nrecognised faces. Beautifully too, with\ncharacter and elegance. One cannot escape his talent as a photographer, even\nif he whips up ideas about himself as a\nperson and an artist \u201cmyth\u201d \u2013 through\nunabashed proclamations about his\n\u2018personal\u2019 relationship with Heidi\nKlum, for example \u2013 a fashion model\nheavily celebrated in the United States.\nAccording to the exhibition catalogue,\n\u201cpeople who believe that he is \u2018notoriously arrogant\u2019 \u2026 all adds to the myth\u201d.\nEven through all this transcribed \u2018hype\u2019\nand puffery, his demands as an artist\nare there. All of his photographs speak\nof his own desires and pleasures: from\nphysical depictions of the underside of\nwomen\u2019s breasts seen from below, to\nthe more metaphorical, emotional desperation of young models within the\nfashion industry \u2013 all unabashedly laid\nbare as Rankin sees it.\nRosie Milton attempts to portray the capricious world of the celebrity photographer Rankin\nRankin\u2019s photography includes both celebrities such as Blondie (top right) and mere mortals (above)\nseem bewildering in the amalgamation\nof its points of cultural focus. We hope\nthat this list should not only provide\nyou with a more comprehensive guide\n(from those who know it as students),\nbut also keep you busy until the next\nissue of felix, with even more on arts,\ntheatre, dance, books, comedy. In\nshort, anything cultural and happen-ing. Studying at Imperial can be challenging so keeping a healthy balance of\nwork and leisure is essential for a sane\nmind (this coming from someone who\nhas been through Imperial and come\nout smiling with a degree!).\nFashionably\nArtistically late\n\n"

Technology is better and more\naffordable. Chile, Argentina and Spain\nare improving every year, as are the\nlesser-known parts of Italy. Even\nFrance has had to up its game as a result of wthe reliability of the Antipodes, and the threat of diminishing EU\nsubsidies.\nThe supermarkets take advantage\nof this competition in quality, and, as\nyou can see below, put some seriously\ngood value offerings on the shelves.\nTake this with you the next time you\nare stocking up.\n(NB. Lots of these are marked Asda.\nThey aren\u2019t made by Asda, they just\nput their name on it. The producers\u2019\nnames are on the bottle.)\nASDA allowed felix to \u2018test\u2019 their wine stocks, a slurring David Stewart makes the most of this opportunity\nSome think\ninternship.\nWe think\nlong term.\nThinking New Perspectives.\nCredit Suisse is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate in its employment decisions on the basis of any protected category.

With us, there\u2019s more to it than that.\nYou\u2019ll join a real team, getting a close-up view of how we work. You\u2019ll gain a deep understanding of global\nfinance and learn why it\u2019s still such a rewarding and highly exciting career. And with many of our interns joining\nus in full-time roles afterwards, you might as well make yourself at home.\nTake a closer look at www.credit-suisse.com/careers\nAsda Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon 2009, 13%, \u00a33.11\nParty wine, but no more than that, so don\u2019t expect excitement. Like drinking a blackberry yoghurt.\nVillaseta Nero D\u2019Avola Syrah 2008, 13%, \u00a34.97\nLovely plummy Sicilian. A bit of chocolatey spice adds some interest. Would be great with, and in,\na good thick bolognese for pasta.\nAsda Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo 2008, 12.5%, \u00a33.31\nThis is a less serious wine, but fantastic for drinking on its own. Sweet baked fruit, but it retains\nsome juiciness and just a touch of tannin in the mouth to remind you it\u2019s there.\nAsda Portuguese Red NV, 13%, \u00a33.38\nThis is the bargain of the bargains. Made from a mix of grapes I\u2019ve never heard of. There\u2019s a touch\nof air-freshener and animal on the nose (in a good way). Dense sweet dark fruit keeps it lingering\nin the mouth. Moreish.\nReds\nAsda Valencia Medium White NV, 11.5%, \u00a32.98\nWell, I wouldn\u2019t pay any more for it, but it is drinkable. A bit\nof sweetness helps it slip down with the floral Macabao grape\nadding a little perfume. A good party wine\u2013 Best chilled.\nKen Forrester Cape Breeze Chenin Blanc 2009, 13%, \u00a34.98\nSouth Africa makes a lot of Chenin. Not all is good. This is good\nand dry with a nice thick body to it, and shows off the grape in its\nless extravagantly fragrant mode. A nice alternative to a typical\nAussie Chardonnary.\nAsda Argentian Torrontes 2009, 13.3%, \u00a34.24\nIt\u2019s okay to drink this grape, nowadays\u2013 the powers that be have\nbeen giving it the thumbs up. It\u2019s very aromatic, like pot-pourri\n(dried rose petals, lavender). Don\u2019t let this put you off, as it has\ngood rounded acidity. A brilliant match for Thai food.\nWhites\nAsda Extra Special Vintage Cava 2005, 11.5%, \u00a36.98\nMade using the same method as Champagne, this is worth about\nthree times its price in Champagne terms. Lemon and lemon rind\non the nose. A dense professional-tasting mousse (foaminess).\nDry and persistent with some grapey notes.\nFizzy Stuff\nMarcus was going hardcore this time and snorting the wine\n\n"

Could you give\nus a brief overview of the last\nyear?\nWell as you said we were team of\nthe year. It was the first time the club\nachieved an award like that. The first\nand second teams are in same division\n(BUCS 2A South Eastern Region) and\nwe did the double on them, winning 9-1\n& 8-2. This year we\u2019re in first division,\nafter going unbeaten and winning both\nthe league and cup. We hope to push\nfor promotion into premier league.\nThe seconds hope to gain promotion\ninto 1st division this year. The women,\nhave been in BUCS 1A division, for a\nwhile, pushing for promotion. Hopefully this year they will succeed.\nIs there anything the club wants\nto improve on last year and can\nyou incorporate that into what\nyou aim to achieve this year?\nWe didn\u2019t get much recognition into\nfelix. That\u2019s our fault. We want to get\nmore articles into the felixSport pages\nthis year. The problem is that the team\nis very divided from the social. We\nwant to get more interaction and produce more value for the social players\nGive me a background on how\nthe tennis club work. For instance what days do the social\nplayers train, likewise with the\ncompetitive team? Is there any\ninteraction?\nThe competitive team train on Tuesdays. This year we have Phil Jakeman,\nfulltime Biochemistry student, part\ntime RTP qualified coach. This is the\nsame qualification Toni Nadal, Rafael\u2019s\ncoach. Our home matches take place\non Wednesday in Hyde Park. And\nSundays we train at the Queen\u2019s Club.\nThey have fantastic facilities.\nThe social team have an extra training session on Wednesday (1 - 4). They\nalso train on Sundays (10 - 2). A new\nintroduction to these sessions is that\nwe have coaching for the social play-ers. Members of the competitive team\nwill be on hand to coach our social\nplayers. To increase the value for these\nplayers we have provided brand new\nrackets and balls if a player doesn\u2019t\nhaven any and we have introduced an\nonline booking system for the courts.\nThis is at South Park, which has brand\nnew, resurfaced courts. It\u2019s about 20\nminutes from the South Kensington\ncampus. If you\u2019re a social member you\npay \u00a329 and competitive team members pay \u00a335 per year. Its great value\nbecause to get time on the South Park\ncourts you have to pay around \u00a310 an\nhour.\nWhat are your other prospects for\nthe year?\nTo fight for promotion into the premier league we need some more play-ers. We lost a number of key players\nlast year. We really need to recruit. So\nfor those of you that played a lot before\nuniversity but opted for a change and\nplayed a different sport at Imperial like\nfootball or rugby, and are in the senior years, come and trial with us! Drop\nme a mail at lawn.tennis@ic.ac.uk.\nThen you can come to Queen\u2019s to trial.\nStandard wise, the first team has a host\nof county level players though in the\npast we have had some international\nstandard players.\nFor the social side of the club we now\nhave an events officer, Pierre Monty.\nHe has cocktail evenings, casino nights\nand entry to private members clubs\nall lined up this year. He is also going\nto try to get tickets for the BlackRock\nMasters at the Royal Albert Hall.\nI know you\u2019re always looking for\nnew players. However, specifically for the first team are you\nlooking to make your 2nd players\nstep up or are you pursuing completely\nnew\nquality\nplay-ers?\nThere\nare one\nor two\nin the\nseconds who\nI think can\nmake the transition into the\nfirsts. Overall they are at\na very good\nstandard. The\nonly difference is\nin the mental aspect of the game.\nSaying that we\ndo need some\nnew blood for\nthe firsts. The ladies will definitely\nneed some new\nplayers.\nYou mentioned about\nnew events and your new\nsocial secretary. Are you planning any overseas tours this\nyear, like some of the other\nsports clubs at Imperial?\nWe are hoping to go on our\nfirst tour for four years. This\nwill be different because we\nwill actually play matches\nthis time. We aim to go\nto Croatia and play at\nthe famous Split club,\nwhere Goran Ivanisevic\nand Mario Ancic play.\nThey have amazing clay\ncourts and we hope\nto set up a mini Davis\nCup where we will go\nto croatia one year and\nthey will come to us the\nnext to play at Queen\u2019s.\nTaking a wider look at\ntennis, where do you see\nyourselves fitting in the\nwhole ACC, union and\nSport Imperial. What is your\nopinion of these bodies?\nComparing to London Metropolitan and other universities\nit is evident that we don\u2019t get as much\nattention as the big sports like football\nand rugby. If we had a little bit more\nmoney for coaching etc., we could have\ndeveloped a bit more. Also, on a media\npoint of view, there is not much attention given to the fact that we play in\nfantastic facilities like Queen\u2019s. Though\nrecently after speaking with Samantha\nBell, the new Sports Development Officer at Sport Imperial she seems enthusiastic of the club\u2019s plans this year,\nwhich is encouraging.\nTwenty minutes with Robert Bush...\nMustapher Botchway of felixSport interviews this year\u2019s president of the\nTennis Club and 1st team stalwart, last year\u2019s team of the year.\n\n"

We met at\n9am on Saturday morning and many were looking worse for\nwear from the previous night. Physics\nexams and others had recently finished\nand a combination of this and an ICSE\nsocial had led to some hangovers in the\nbus. Despite repeated advertising of\nthe time of departure, by quarter past 9\nwe were still waiting for two, Alex and\nMarita, and bets began to be placed on\nwho was to be the last.\nPhonecalls to the pair meant the race\nwas on as Marita was getting cash out\nin Sherfield and Alex was on his way\nfrom South Ken station. In what was to\nbecome characteristic lateness it was\nAlex who turned up latest with Nathaniel beginning to drive away as he\narrived, just to annoy him. All aboard\nwe headed to our next stop, Reading,\nto pick up Samir who wasn\u2019t going to\nmiss his train... At some stage along\nthe M4 he called. He\u2019d missed the train\nand the next one wouldn\u2019t get him in\nto Reading station until almost an hour\nlater than we\u2019d planned.\nWith the delays in our departure and\nthe increasing volume of the demands\nfor a breakfast stop the obvious solution was a McDonalds visit to waste\nhalf an hour. We reached the outskirts\nof Reading and then stopped at the\nfirst available McDonalds where the\ngreasy food hangover cure was a popular choice with some notable porridge-loving exceptions.\nDriving on into Reading was where\nthe navigating became more interest-ing; in the interests of finding a McDonalds we had deviated from our\nGoogle Map and were now reliant\non Reading\u2019s signposts to lead us to\na seemingly easy target, the station.\nHowever, we had counted on neither\nthe massive leaf growth, nor Reading\ncouncil\u2019s ingenious habit of placing\ntraffic lights directly in front of the\ndirection signs indicating where you\nwere going at any particular junction.\nMore by fluke than skill we pulled\ninto the station waiting area as Samir\u2019s\ntrain pulled into the station. A man\nwith a parrot on his shoulder then\nproceeded to amuse us whilst Samir\ngot lost trying to find the bus. Some\nmore interesting navigation later and\nwe were back on the M4 headed for\nBristol.\nEverything was going well until the\nlow foliage issue cropped up again in\nthe centre of Bristol. At a critical junction our sign was obscured by a tree\nand despite going round the roundabout twice we failed to make the right\nchoice. The result: a half hour long\ndetour up a random road in Bristol, an\neducating experience. As we were now\neffectively 2 hours late we had to call\nand rearrange our factory tour time,\nbut at least we were back on track and\nracing along at the veritable light speed\nof 62mph.\nEventually we arrived in Cheddar and everyone got out outside the\nCheese Factory for some lunch before our tour, well at least they stood\naround the box of food like sad puppies\nwondering where their bowls were,\nwhilst I paid. As I explained that there\nwas more of a \u201cself-service\u201d ethos to\nthis trip \u2013 food in box, you eat food \u2013\neveryone began to tuck in.\nThe tour of the cheese factory that\nfollowed was exciting to all lovers of\ncheese \u2013 especially Alex (next year\u2019s\nPresident) who wanted to go back\nto halls with concrete evidence for a\ncorridor mate that leaving milk to go\noff indefinitely would NOT produce\ncheese, and indeed it doesn\u2019t. A video\nshowed us the entire process, from un-pasteurised milk arriving in a lorry to\nthe finished product aging in a cave,\nwhilst a man could be seen actually doing some of it through a glass viewing\nwindow. In fact, the cheese maker occasionally came out to speak to visitors\nand we were lucky enough to ask him\na few questions about how the cheese\nwas made, all of which were answered\nin a delightful Somerset accent.\nIn fact, it is worth noting that this\ngentleman named Ande, who has\nwon world\u2019s best cheddar award for\na number of years, can no longer eat\ncheese! He now suffers from diabetes\nand has had a massive heart attack\nand can no longer consume any of\nthe superb cheese he spends his life\nproducing!\nAfter viewing the factory we finished our tour with the tasting, where\nevery variety of Cheddar they produce\nin the factory could be sampled, including the interesting Cheddar with\nyeast, tasting like marmite. They also\ninformed us that if we went to see the\ncaves we would be able to see their\ncheese being aged there in large cages.\nI can confirm that cave aged cheese\ndoes has a significantly different taste\nto normal cheddar and would recommend that it\u2019s well worth a try.\nIt was promised that everyone would\nhave an opportunity to buy from the\nshop, the following day, but as the\nweather was wonderfully warm we\nworried the cheese might spoil. With a\nstrict agreement to meet back outside\nthe factory at 4:30 everyone wandered\noff to enjoy the town, leaving Nathaniel\nand me behind as food box sitters. We\nwould like to thank Hugh who bought\nus both drinks to make the wait more\nenjoyable.\nAt 4:30 everyone was back in the\nbus except, somewhat predictably,\nSamir, John and Alex. 15 minutes later\nthey deigned to make an appearance\nprotesting that they\u2019d had no idea the\ncorrect time was 4:30. Sarcastic comments to the effect that everyone else\nhad managed to arrive promptly fell on\ndeaf ears, and with everyone collected\nwe drove to the Youth Hostel, whose\nentrance was perilously narrow.\nNikita and I hid our eyes as Nathaniel carefully manoeuvred the bus round\na corner I was convinced it would not\nfit around. Cheese Soc simply doesn\u2019t\nhave the money to pay the \u00a3400 fee for\nwriting off a minibus and there was a\ndeserved round of applause as he expertly parked us. During check-in it\ntranspired that the rooms we had been\nallocated were not those we\u2019d been\ntold about over the phone, but despite\nthat confusion we managed to get the\nboys and girls in separate rooms and\nunpacking.\nThough it was still early we decided\nthat making a premature start to dinner would be a good way to maximise\nthe obvious evening activity of cider\nsampling. The assistance of many\nwonderful cheese graters and John\nproduced an interesting yet tasty Macaroni cheese, prepared with 5 different\ncheeses.\nNext stop was predictably the pub\nwhere people had previously found a\nCider Festival was being held and at \u00a31\nfor half a pint of almost any cider you\ncould name, what better way to spend\na balmy summers evening? We discovered that the pub had a late licence yet\nsome still managed to stay until closing\ntime.\nThe next morning our appointment\nto visit the caves was at 10am and considering the amount some people had\ndrunk the previous night, the cooked\nbreakfast was welcomed by most. After\nconsiderable hassling almost everyone\narrived for breakfast with one excep-tion, John, who was in as sorry a state\nas Toby had been the previous day.\nEventually we arrived to get our cave\ntickets and the enthusiastic exhibit\nman radioed round all of his colleagues\nso that we could split up and still see all\nof the exhibits. First stop was the much\nrevered cave of the Cheddar Man, with\nthe 100,000 year old skeleton displayed\nat the entrance. However, the displays\nof stalactites and stalagmites we saw\ninside were not quite as impressive as\nthe amount of time it took Raphael to\ngo round the caves. Helene theorised\nthat he was listening to the audio guide\nto every exhibit in both French and\nEnglish but whatever the reasons for\nit most people had retired to Cheddars smallest tea house by the time he\nemerged.\nAfter some truly delightful scones\nand tea, a cultural experience for our\nforeign students, we progressed to the\nMuseum of Prehistory where the most\nnoteworthy exhibit was undoubtedly\nthe giant rotating defleshed skull de-signed, we hope, to show how the previously cannibalistic people living in\nthe caves left the skulls of their dead.\nOnce again Raphael was last out of the\nmuseum; perhaps we just don\u2019t have\nthe same interest in cannibalism as he\ndoes...\nThe last stop before lunch was Cox\u2019s\nCave, described as frightening and in\nits own way it was; though mostly in\nthe \u201chow could they make a cave tour\nthis tacky\u201d way. As you entered the\ncave complex there was mood lighting\nand, bizarrely, opera which is presumably pitched so that with enough repetitions the stalactites will all fall off the\nceiling to spear a school child. However, this was not the \u201creally scary\u201d\npart, marked with a special sign. Here\nthings went downhill, fast, first there\nwere the wild animals with red eyes,\nand then the disappearing goblins with\nglowing eyes. However, the final chamber housed a woman suspended in the\nair, with a plastic dragon and strobe\nlighting. We emerged having laughed a\ngreat deal and were all ready for lunch.\nThe remainder of the day was free\nand whilst some attempted the gorge\nwalk with its beautiful views across\nthe reservoir and fields, others opted\nfor more leisurely pursuits such as icecream eating and cider vat collection.\nWhen we were reunited for the trip\nhome everyone had a souvenir of some\ndescription, whether it was handmade\nsweets, 5 gallons of cider or our beloved Cheddar.\nHappily the trip home was less interesting than the trip there and for\nsome particularly (oh poor Beth) it\nwas marred only by Alex and John\u2019s\nintent discussion of the relative merits of different classes of starship and\nwhich races could potentially breed.\nOr something. Your reaction to the validity of a 4 hour conversation in this\nvein may tell you something about the\nsuitability of Imperial for someone of\nyour temperament.\nWith many thanks to the M4 bus\nlane, we made it back almost on\ntime and wonderfully on budget for\nfuel. The first Cheese Soc tour was a\ngreat success and I hope you\u2019ll join us\nnext year for our next tours, where a\ntrip to Switzerland has already been\nproposed.\nEmail: cheeses@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Cheese Society Takes a Trip Round Their Spiritual Home\nCheeseSoc\u2019s first trip, here, an example of just a slice of what they get up to.\nYour Club or Society Here.\nDescription of your awesome trip or event here.\nThere are 346 clubs and societies at Imperial.

Aside from\nhis achievements in the field of biol-ogy, Dr. Lamb has been carrying out\nanalyses of undergraduate writing for\nmore than thirty years, at Imperial as\nwell as across the country.\nThough science students may have\nthought they\u2019d left their writing days\nbehind them, communication skills are\nan integral part of any modern science\ndegree. Essays, lab reports and projects\nintrude into even the most theoretical\nof subjects, and an inability to write\nproficiently can have unfortunate\nconsequences for a graduate\u2019s career\nprospects.\n\u201cHome students should be very concerned about their verbal proficiency\nas it affects performance in course\nwork, exams and job applications. I\nsaw a letter last week from an on-line\nrecruitment agency stating that one\nthird of job applicants from home\ngraduates, even from top universities,\nwere rejected immediately because of\npoor English in their CVs and covering\nletters, showing lack of attention to de-tail, poor communication skills and a\nbad attitude\u201d explained Dr. Lamb.\nHis findings reveal a large number\nof students who still confuse omit with\nemit, infect with affect or even inject,\nemaciate with emasculate, impotence\nwith importance and formerly with\nformally. He makes the point that for\nstudents working in the sciences, confusing lead with led is as egregious as\nconfusing sodium nitrite with sodium\nnitrate.\nThe improved syntax displayed by\ninternational students suggests that\nstudents in the UK prioritise their verbal communication over the way they\nwrite. Home students are clearly more\nat ease in spoken English, but seem to\nassume this will translate to a similar\nfluency in writing. Unfortunately this\nis not the case, and many students\nneed to make more of an effort to improve the way they write.\n\u201cThose academic staff who are capable of doing so should correct errors\nof English as well as of science,\u201d Dr.\nLamb suggests. Advice from above will\ndoubtless prove useful, but in the final\nanalysis students will need to take matters into their own hands. As an obvious solution, students can make more\ncautious use of spellcheckers and have\na dictionary on hand when they write.\n\u201cMy own English was not very good\nat university,\u201d Dr. Lamb admitted.\n\u201cWhen I was lecturing at IC in 1970, I\nhad a female Sri Lankan research student who kindly pointed out my errors.\nTo be told by a foreign student that my\nEnglish was poor was humiliating but\nextremely useful. I started learning\nrules of spelling, word origins, using\na dictionary more often, and playing\nScrabble with her so that she could\ncorrect my spelling. Although I lost the\nfirst 80 games, we both ended up in the\nfinals of the National Scrabble Championships, and I am now a mediocre\nspeller rather than a bad one. One can\nimprove!\u201d\n\u201cFor obvious reasons\u201d Dr. Lamb\nrecommends two volumes specifically geared for university students:\nThe Queen\u2019s English Society\u2019s Practical Guide to Punctuation (by B. C.\nLamb, \u00a33 including postage, available\nGilead Amit\nGilead Amit Deputy Editor\nRaz Jabary reports back as 11 Imperial students complete the El Salvador Project 2009 with great success\nT\nhis summer break a group\nof 11 Civil Engineering students spent their time in El\nSalvador constructing houses for poor communities.\nThe team consisted of six first years,\ntwo second years and three third years\nand carried out the project over the period 3rd July - 15th August.\nThe El Salvador Project has a voluntary basis and is currently in its eighth\nyear of operation. It was set up by Imperial professors and students as a result of the devastating series of earthquakes and landslides that struck the\ncountry in 2001.\nThe students spent the weekdays\nover a six week period in the community of Colima, during which they built\ntwo earthquake resistant block houses\nand a retaining wall to benefit two fam-ilies. Special trips were organised for in\nthe weekends by the NGO of REDES\n(the Salvadorian Reconstruction &\nDevelopment organisation), with the\naim of getting the students in touch\nwith the country\u2019s history, culture and\ntraditions. These included visits to\nMayan ruins and the Museum of the\nRevolution.\nThis year\u2019s project was held in the\nsmall town of Colima, located in the\nCuscatlan Governorate which has\nthree of the poorest regions in the\ncountry. It is about an hour and a half\ndrive away from the capital San Salvador. A village in the early eighties, Colima gradually grew out to a small town\nduring the Salvadorian civil war (1980-1992) with many people seeking refuge\nthere from the fighting. The horrors\nof this war and the associated financial crisis are still fresh in the minds\nof the people of Colima. As a gesture\nof respect the community offered its\nchurch to the Imperial students as a\nhome for the duration of their stay.\nOn site work included the making of\nconcrete and mortar, the placement of\nblocks and pipelines, the tying of reinforcement bars to allow for strength of\nthe structure in tension and the levelling of the floor. In addition to the students hired skilled workers and some\nable family members aided the construction efforts.\nTeam work was optimum and no\nmajor problems or difficulties were encountered by the language barrier, for\nin addition to having three translators\nEl Salvador Project 2009: Civil Engineers do good\non the team many members had successfully grasped a basic knowledge of\nSpanish.\nThe El Salvador Project has a board\nof alumni members who oversee the\nrunning of its activities. It receives its\nfunds from sponsorship money, in addition to a personal contribution from\neach of the team members. Earlier\nthis year felix reported on the success\nof the JP Morgan competition in New\nYork, where on April 17th the El Salvador Project won $25,000 to finance its\nwork. The team is currently competing\nonline in the \u2018Give-it-Away\u2019 competition for a further astounding $65,000\nagainst other projects from around the\nglobe; dependent on the number of\nvotes it gets by May 2010.\nFurther help to the team was provided by the organisation of ADESCO,\nwhich is made up of men and women\ncommitted to the coordination of the\naid work in the community of Colima.\nIdeas for the improvement of the\nproject\u2019s effectiveness include future\nSpanish classes for all members and\nthe allocation of funds and personnel\nto multiple communities rather than\none over a summer term.\nRecapping on this year\u2019s project,\nteam member and potential future\nteam leader Andres remarks: \u201cIt has\nexceeded all expectations by a massive\nmargin.\nIt combined valuable engineering experience as well as an insight of/on the\ncountry\u2019s culture, politics and tradi-tions. We all gained friends within the\ngroup which we probably would not\nhave met otherwise and were hosted\nincredibly well by the local NGO REDES and of course by the population of\nColima\u201d.\nCommenting on the selection process for next year\u2019s team which will soon\ncommence, Andres says: \u201cWithout a\ndoubt I would recommend future Civil\nEngineering students to enrol in this\nproject and embrace everything it has\nto offer\u201d.\nMum always wondered why some of her daughters grew up to be 6ft and English. She loved them all the same thought\nfrom him) and How to Write about\nBiology by Pechenik and Lamb (Long-man, 1996, still in print and in the IC\nLibrary).\nImperial students have historically\nbeen among the most employable of\nUK graduates, and have gone on to careers in a wide range of sectors. Especially in these difficult economic times,\nit would be a shame to make anything\nbut the best possible impression on\nprospective employers.\nSpelling and grammar may seem\nlike petty issues, but a lack of attention in writing can change meaning,\ncause confusion and give a clear impression that the writer is lacking in\nprofessionalism.\nEditor\u2019s note:\nHere at felix we do our best to keep\nsuch errors to a minimum, thanks to a\ntalented team of writers, a handful of\ndedicated copy editors and a great deal\nof wishful thinking. Should you notice syntactical mistakes in this issue,\nhowever, maybe a temporary career in\nproofreading beckons. The felix offices\nare in the West Wing of Beit Quad, and\ncopy editors are welcome all of Wednesday and Thursday every week.\n\n"

    "content": "27\nfelix FRIDAY 16 OCTOBER 2009\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk MUSIC\nL\nead singer Jack Steadman on\nstage is possibly one of the\nmost intriguing musical sights\non offer this side of the Milleninium. He takes that clich\u00e9d image of\na shy, semi-autistic musician who finds\nconfidence in his music, and turns it\non its head. Between songs he swaggers around the stage, guitar hanging\ncasually off his shoulders but during\nthe songs, it all disappears and he truly\nbecomes a sight to behold.\nA manic smile remains firmly glued\nto his face as his voice slides and\nbreaks. When his right hand leaves\nthe guitar, it slowly rises up to his face\nbefore his barely contained excitement\ncomes crashing down with his hand\nonto the strings. He frequently forgets\nto return to the microphone in between gleefully riffing on his guitar in\nfront of the drummer and visibly aches\nto escape the microphone at the end of\nevery sentence.\nHis disagreement with the microphone could be interpreted as a phobia but it comes off as simple, sheer\necstasy.\nAside from the sheer awesomeness\nof Jack Steadman and Bombay Bicycle Club\u2019s material in general (slight\nauthor bias), there are a few things\nthat detract from the experience.\nSteadman\u2019s strangeness does at times\nBombay Bicycle Club @ Heaven\nmeans that he misses or fudges lines,\ndepending on how into the rhythm of\nthe music you are, this is either completely missed or ruins the song. More\nimportantly however, 80% of BBC\nfans are 5ft 2, 12 year old indie kids\nwho like to \u201cmosh\u201d. Definitely a bit ir-ritating, and I definitiely didn\u2019t jump\nin with them\u2026\n- Kadhim Shubber\nT\nhe plural still resides tonight\nbut we are only treated to\na singular affair as a lone\nJohn Darnielle briskly walks\nonto the stage. He gives a meek Thai\ngreeting as thanks for the ovation he\nreceives. Suited and gangly, with subdued confidence, his humble stage\npresence is warming as he directly engages the crowd.\nEvidently an incredibly gifted songwriter his literate lyrics have earned\na cult following, the large auditorium\nnestled by the Thames is mostly full. He\ncomments on how it is strange to play\nsuch a venue, where the crowd is silent.\nA stark contrast to the usual small bars\nhe would normally frequents on tours\nin smaller cities. Becoming more comfortable addressing the audience, he\nshares a secret to his rapid strumming,\nturns out it was more down to polishing his trumpet than playing his guitar.\nStarting on the piano for the first\nfew songs, comparisons to such as\nthe more serious side of Ben Folds\nwould not be unfounded but the majority of the set is performed with\njust an acoustic guitar. With the lack\nof a backing band, or any further accompaniment whatsoever, there was a\ndistinct lack in musical variation aside\nMountain Goats @ Southbank\nBombay Bicycle Club\nHeaven, Under the Arches\n8th October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nfrom dynamics and as a result the hour\nand a half set began to feel like it was\ntreating water more than it was swim-ming. Lyrically his songs fit together\nencompassing several series, and are\ninteresting in their own right, yet a lot\nwas detracted tonight as musical similarities prevailed as the set continued.\n- Christopher Walmsley\nLive\nThe Mountain Goats\nThe Southbank Centre\n10th October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nI\nbet you\u2019ve already heard DJ\nShadow; he\u2019s a stern favourite of\nadvertising execs and BBC sound\neditors. As soon as you\u2019re familiar with his stuff, he\u2019ll haunt you like a\nghost. Next time you see Jeremy Clarkson rev a brand new Italian sports car\nor O2 brag about their latest deals in\na cutting edge ad, don\u2019t be surprised if\nyou hear the glitched drums or ethereal synths of DJ Shadow\u2019s 1996 debut\nalbum. It\u2019s famed for being the first album to consist entirely of samples; it\u2019s\neven in the Guinness book of world\nrecords.\nSampling, for the uninitiated, is essentially cutting up chunks of other\npeople\u2019s recordings and transfiguring\nthem into your own musical ideas, and\nto a lot of people that sounds like cheat-ing, the Verve, for instance, have to pay\n100% of their royalties for Bitter Sweet\nSymphony to Mick and Keith because\nof some strings that are sampled from a\ncover of a Rolling Stones song.\nHowever this album stands as indubitable proof that sampling is just\nas valid as regular writing styles, no\nmatter what money hungry, coked\nup, rock stars think. Shadow mixes\nsamples from an unholy range of\nsources including: Mettallica, A Tribe\nCalled Quest, Bjork, the Blade Runner\nSoundtrack and countless numbers of\nobscure bargain bin records to create\na sound which is completely alien to\nall its sources. Expertly cut up hip hop\nbeats accompany a schizophrenic or-gan, doom metal drones add darkness\nto Rick James funk resulting in amazingly intricate soundscapes that are so\nremoved from regular music they can,\nin fact, soundtrack virtually anything.\nAlbums that you should know\nShadows warped taste combined\nwith his virtuosic DJ skill made this\nalbum the benchmark for experimental music in the mid 90\u2019s notably influencing the likes of Radiohead, J Dilla\nand Danger Mouse. Unfortunately\nShadow never regained this kind of\nform with the exception perhaps of\nthe UNKLE collaboration \u2018Psyence\nFiction\u2019. Notable in his demise was\n2006\u2019s \u2018the Outsider\u2019 which featured\nan ill-advised foray into crunk and a\nKasabian collaboration.

No thanks.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my\ninvention, but I\u2019m\nsad that it is used by\nterrorists... I would\nprefer to have\ninvented a ... lawn\nmower\u201d\nA\ns yet another academic\nyear starts it is another\nopportunity for employers to recruit. The month\nof October sees the annual ritual known as the milk-round,\nthe trekking of company HR teams\nfrom university to university, attending\nall manner of careers fairs, to interest\nand sign up talented final year students\nto their graduate programmes.\nA feature of Imperial career fairs is\nthe high concentration of arms compa-nies, which rightfully raises some ethical concerns among the student body.\nPerhaps owing to Imperial\u2019s focus on\nscience and engineering degrees, and\nour high-up-the-league-table status,\narms companies seem to find a perfect recruiting ground here in South\nKensington.\nWhen final year students come to\nchoose which employers to work for,\nafter years of hard graft at Imperial,\nnumerous factors are obviously considered like starting salary, job location\nand employer reputation. The importance of each of these factors will of\ncourse vary from student to student,\nbut I would say that the ethical values\nof the companies we apply to, especially with respect to arms companies, is\njust as important.\nI have called them \u201carms companies\u201d up until now, but they prefer to\ncall themselves the \u201cDefence Industry\u201d.\nAt last year\u2019s IC Union Careers Fair in\n2008 for example, we had BAE systems\nand Selex Galileo exhibiting, and other\n\u201cDefence Industry\u201d big names including Lockheed Martin UK, DSTL,\nMarshall Aerospace, ITT and\nRaytheon Systems to name\nbut a few. On their\nwebsites and\nbrochures,\ntheir \u2018About\nUs\u2019 blurbs talk\nabout \u201cadvanced\nelectronics\u201d, \u201cintegrated security solutions\u201d and \u201cland, sea\nand air defence technologies\u201d, but behind\nall the euphemisms it\ndoesn\u2019t take an Imperial student to figure\nout that these are alternative ways of saying\n\u201cwe make weapons.\u201d\nThe word \u2018arm\u2019 is\nshort for \u2018armaments\u2019,\nthe weapons used in\nmilitary warfare. These\ninclude large military\nhardware like jet fight-ers, missiles, tanks, land\nvehicles and battleships,\nas well as small low-tech\nequipment like pistols, rifles, grenade\nlaunchers, munitions and landmines,\nand all the accompanying technologies\nthat come with it. Few people will tell\nyou that there is a shortage of weapons\nin the world, in fact the general consensus is that the world has too many\nweapons, fuelling various conflicts and\nwars in the world.\nA shocking statistic comes from\nthe United Nations Security Council\n(UNSC), the highest inter-govern-mental body charged\nwith maintaining\ninternational peace.\nArms companies\nin the permanent five\ncountries of the\nUNSC: China,\nFrance, Russia,\nthe UK and USA\ntogether manufacture 75%\nof the world\u2019s weapons. These weapons are either sold to the country\u2019s\nown government (domestic market)\nor exported to foreign allies (foreign\nmarket). Who are the top recipients?\nDeveloping countries with the money\nto buy them of course, including rising economic superpowers like India,\nex-Soviet states like Poland or oil-rich\nMiddle-Eastern states like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE.\nEstimates put the global amount of\nmoney spent procuring, or buying,\narms from private companies at 1 trillion dollars a year, as these developed\ncountries dedicate large chunks of\ntheir military budgets to beefing up\ntheir own armed forces. It\u2019s no secret\nthat corruption, and political manipu-lation, is common place in this weapons supply chain. In December 2006\nBAE systems was about to be investigated on criminal\ncharges relating to bribery in the sale\nof Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to\nSaudi Arabia in a \u00a36bn contract,\nuntil they successfully lobbied\nthe then-British Prime\nMinister Tony Blair\nto intervene\nand halt\nthe en-quiry.\nRecently in\nOctober 2009 BAE corruption again resurfaced in the news as\nthey risked being taken to court, this\ntime to answer allegations of paying\nbribes to win contracts in Tanzania,\nRomania and Czech Republic. In fact\nthe international arms trade has been\nlabelled by Transparency International\nas one of the three most corrupt businesses in the world.\nI believe we should not be doing\nthings in life just because it earns us\na good monthly salary. This is the attitude of low-skilled occupations like\nmigrant labourers, factory workers or\neven prostitutes because they have little or no other choice on how to earn\ntheir livelihood. As an Imperial gradu-ate, despite the fewer graduate vacancies available in the current economic\nrecession, we are gifted with choice,\nvariety and options in what job we do\nin life.\nAs Imperial students we learn technical knowledge and skills that most\nof the general population don\u2019t have\nthe ability to learn. Surely there are\nmore useful ways of using our technical knowledge than designing\nthings which kill peo-ple, or worse injure or maim them. If ever\nyou are in any\ndoubt\nof the\npower\nof modern\nconventional\nweaponry, you can\njust walk down Exhibition Road and\nsee for yourself. Opposite the Science\nMuseum on the east side of Exhibition\nRoad lies the V&A museum, where\nnext to the Exhibition Road entrance\nis a section of wall damaged by bombs\ndropped on London by Nazi Germany\nduring the Blitz in World War II.\nThe damaged section has been intentionally left there and text inscribed\nnext to it as the picture above shows.\nThis wall in London is the closest thing\nyou can get to a gutted apartment\nblock in Lebanon or a bullet-ridden\nschool classroom in Sierra Leone. Run\nyour hand over the deep dents in the\nwall, feel the hardness of that stone and\nimagine what that could have done to\nhuman flesh. A boyish obsession with\ntanks, guns and all-things military is\nunderstandable while fragging enemies in Halo 3, Call of Duty or Counter\nStrike: Source, but transferring it over\nto real life is quite frankly ridiculous.\nAircrafts and bombs are examples\nof larger military hardware, but small\narms can cause just as much damage\nand human suffering because they are\npresent in greater quantities. Post-colonial Africa is a continent characterised by civil war, and with few weapons factories of its own, it\u2019s no surprise\nthat 95% of ammunitions and arms\nused in African conflicts come from\noutside Africa. It begins with legal\nsale of arms to African states, much\nof which occurred during the Cold\nWar in the 1970s and 1980s when the\nUS and USSR backed dictators of their\nchoosing. Through the black market,\nthousands, if not millions, of Glock\npistols, AK-47 Kalashnikov rifles and\nother handheld weapons fell, and continue to fall, into the hands of war lords\nand armed gangs.\nAmnesty International estimates\nthere are 600 millions guns in circulation worldwide. While private arms\ncompanies, particularly those in the\npermanent five UNSC countries, are\nhappy to manufacture and sell to any\nbuyer they can find, it\u2019s the humans\nin poor war-trodden countries\nthat pay the price in\nbloodshed and\nlives lost.\nWhilst\nnot ig-nor-ing oth- er\ncausal fac- tors\nof conflict like\npolitical disa- greement,\nreligious schism or access to resources,\nit is clear that easy availability to such\nweapons is a major cause of sparking\nand elongating conflicts. Numerous\ninternational treaties exist which attempt to control the development,\nmanufacture, stockpiling and use of\nweapons. But the global defence industry is a powerful one with a long\nhistory of lobbying politicians, and for\nmost people who work in it the impact\nof their products matters little, as long\nas the sale makes a profit.\nBy now you might be thinking I\u2019m\nsome ardent pacifist, completely\nagainst war in any situation whatsoev-er. Well I\u2019m not, because self-preserva-tion or self-defence is often necessary\n- like in the Nazi bombing of London\nin the 1940s - and for this reason, advanced weapons and the companies\nthat manufacture them are vital. What\nI am arguing is that the lack of ethical behaviour of companies like BAE\nsystems and Selex Galileo, and the\nultimate use of most weapons in the\nworld today, should be of major concern to us Imperial students who they\nseek to recruit. Those of us applying\nto the graduate schemes of companies\nin the \u201cDefence Industry\u201d should think\nagain. There are enough weapons in\nthe world today, but a million other\nways for Imperial students to use our\nknowledge of science and engineering.\nMikhail Kalashnikov, the 89 year old\nRussian inventor of the infamous AK47 rifle, said in an interview in 2002,\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my invention, but I\u2019m sad\nthat it is used by terrorists... I would\nprefer to have invented a machine that\npeople could use and that would help\nfarmers with their work - for example a\nlawnmower\u201d. Echoes of this quote lie in\nAlbert Einstein\u2019s remark on his role in\nthe development of the nuclear bomb,\nwhere he said, \u201cIf only I had known, I\nwould have become a watchmaker.\u201d\n\n"

What\u2019s left is\nan upbeat, pulsing pop record with a\ncatchy (if a bit mundane) hook and sultry Roxy Music-esque vocals. This is a\ndefinite move towards the mainstream\nand it\u2019s a good one. - Tom Hird\nTHE CHEEK\nHUNG UP\nA&M\nIt\u2019s as though they rounded up Daft\nPunk\u2019s guitars, Justice\u2019s child choir,\nMika\u2019s falsetto vocals, and pulled it together with the synthy pop of Phoenix.\nThis song would be fun if you were on\na good night out and the DJ dropped\nit and you danced like a child after too\nmany sweets, It\u2019s a one night stand of a\nsong, really. - Alex Ashford\nIf you like music with lots of sweeping guitars and some tinkling pianos\nand heartfelt vocals, but Radiohead\nare a bit depressing/weird for you, you\nmight like this. The lyrics are a bit\nrubbish but I think this sort of music\nis for boys who will hear it on Radio 1\nin their car and aren\u2019t likely to listen to\nthe lyrics anyway. - Alex Ashford\nCODEINE\nVELVET CLUB\nVANITY KILLS\nISLAND\nRECORDS\nThis embryonic album uses abstract\nelectronic sounds throughout, and\nhave psychedelic themes, which can be\na nice change to the sterile, produced\nmusic around today, Ultimately it\ndoesn\u2019t tap the true power of The Flaming Lips. It\u2019s background music and\ngreatly self-indulgent. - Luke Turner\nSINGLE\nSINGLE\nTHE FLAMING\nLIPS\nEMBRYONIC\nWARNER BROS\nALBUM\nPASSION PIT\nLITTLE SECRETS\nCOLUMBIA\nSINGLE\nSometimes I wonder if I\u2019m losing the\nplot a bit because I hate every whiny\nindie rock boy band CD we get sent,\nthen I hear a song like this, with reggae\nlegend Horace Andy\u2019s deep vocals over\na crawling trip-hop reggae melody, and\nI realize all is not lost. Massive Attack\nare consistently head-and-shoulders\nabove most music. Overall the EP\nis dark and introverted, like a weird\nweekend come down. - Alex Ashford\nMASSIVE\nATTACK\nSPLITTING THE\nATOM\nVIRGIN\nEP\nSimilar in places to other bands like\nBig Pink and MGMT with a similar\nIndie kind of feel, Little Comets are in-fectious, fun and easy going. Adultery\nas a single is upbeat and melodic with\ncatchy lyrics that you\u2019ll eventually find\nyourself singing along to in the street.\nIt\u2019s definitely worth a listen on iTunes/\nSpotify whenever you\u2019ve got a minute,\nand then you\u2019ll probably finding yourself going to buy it. - Ben Cook\nLITTLE COMETS\nADULTERY\nCOLUMBIA\nSINGLE\nExhibiting a much more mellow side\nthe Arctic Monkeys latest taster from\ntheir relatively unemphatically received third album \u2018Humbug\u2019 is certainly a highlight. Musically it is one\nof the less radical progressions of their\nnew sound but this single, whilst probably not residing in their top draw, as\nprevious albums have left it pretty full,\nis still a very worthwhile listen. - Chris\nWalmsley\nARCTIC\nMONKEYS\nCORNERSTONE\nDOMINO\nSINGLE\nZero7\u2019s fourth album, has a relaxing\nyet uplifting chilled sound. However I\nfeel their style is stuck a decade behind\ncurrent musical trends. The album\nlacks continuity with each song sounding as if it\u2019s been selected from a multitude of different artists and ripped to\na single disc. No song, I feel, on this\nalbum will captivate listeners. A disappointing album compared to their previous work. - Craig Glastonbury\nZERO 7\nYEAH GHOST\nATLANTIC\nALBUM\nBiffy used to be an incredibly interesting band. The latest single \u2018The Captain\u2019 is anthemic, evidently displaying\nambitions of arena tours. It seems like\ntheir idea of making a chorus interesting is adding some token horns at its\nend. It\u2019s a shame to see a band that used\nto be exciting, now treading a generic\nline of mediocrity. - Chris Walmsley\nBIFFY CLYRO\nTHE CAPTAIN\n14TH FLOOR\nSINGLE\nAsh embark on ambitious A-Z project\nKadhim Shubber speaks to frontman Tim Wheeler as Ash set out to change the music world\nT\nim Wheeler is a little wor-ried, excited too of course\nbut a little worried that Ash\u2019s\nalphabetic adventures might\nfall flat on their face. He\u2019s just flown in\nfrom New York where he and the band\nhave spent the last year and a half recording for their A-Z single series. A\nmatching tour, hitting 26 venues each\nbeginning with a letter A-Z, begins on\nMonday in Aldershot which he claims\nis partly to tie in with the single series\nand mostly to do with having fun and\n\u201cdoing things that not a lot of people\nhave done before\u201d.\nThe grueling schedule doesn\u2019t faze\nhim, \u201cI\u2019ve taken up kick-boxing so I\u2019m\nfighting fit\u201d he jokes, clearly it\u2019s not\nthe tour that\u2019s worrying him. The band\nare embarking on a project which says\ngoodbye to the album and hello to\nquick-fire singles.\nAsh\u2019s gripes about the album have\nbeen well documented since 2007,\nwhen announcing their intentions after\nthe release of their last album Twilight\nof the Innocents, Tim declared that \u201cI\u2019m\nconstantly disappointed with records I\nbuy\u201d\nThe ill-feeling stems from a desire for\ngreater creative freedom and a reading\nof the musical landscape that could\nprove to be prescient. \u201cThe album was\njust so restrictive, with singles we can\nexperiment more and not be tied down\nto one sound like with an album\u201d.\nAsh are clearly a band who have no\ntime for hanging around, for Tim the\nalbum is simply too slow and distanced\nfrom their fanbase. He theorizes that\nalbums are forced at fans, whereas singles will allow them to become more\nresponsive but also without the creative and financial commitment that a\nalbum requires, allow them to experiment with greater ease.\nIt\u2019s not only albums that have attracted Ash\u2019s ire, the band have also\nshunned the CDs that they\u2019re released on. The A-Z singles are available only by digital download and\n1000 limited 7\u201d vinyls. \u201cCDs have\nbecome really disposable, people just\ndownload them onto their computers and listen to them on their iPods\nanyway so what\u2019s the point?\u201d. They\u2019ve\nalso offered their fans magazine-style\n\u2018subscriptions\u2019 whereby they will automatically receive the singles when\nthey\u2019re released.\nGiven that Ash are so eager to tear\nthe rulebook to shreds it\u2019s interesting\nthat Tim falls squarely into the Lilly\nAllen camp of the current debate on\nmusic piracy. He talks emotively about\nthe vast majority of people who work\nin the music industry on average salaries whose jobs are directly at threat\nbecause of music piracy. To him it\u2019s a\nbread and butter issue, while he understands the pro-piracy arguments it\u2019s a\nsimple case of having to make a living,\n\u201cIf we could afford to give our music\naway for free, then we would\u201d.\nWhether or not their venture turns\nout to be financially successful (I suspect that with their fanbase, it will be)\nAsh have shown both pro and anti piracy advocates a possible vision of the\nfuture; digital downloads, subscrip-tions, greater interactivity with fans\nand ultimately, the death of the album.\nWhat\u2019s all this alphabet business?\nWhat\u2019s the A-Z project?\nAh well, basically Ash are releasing\na single every two weeks, each one\ntitled A, then B etc until they\u2019ve gone\nthrough the alphabet\nNo album then?\nThey don\u2019t make albums anymore!\nReally?\nYeah, in 2007 they released their final album Twilight of the Innocents\nand announced that they would only\never release singles from then on.\nThe first came out on the 12th\nAny explanation?\nTim Wheeler said basically said\nthat the album was dead, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t\nhelped that most people have\nforgotten how to make a decent\nalbum.\u201d\nControversial?\nYeah but he is fit... .....I mean\ntalented!\nThe band\u2019s sound is heavily influenced\nby the left-leaning political punk of\ntwenty years ago, but they are much\nmore convincing when they put the\nfucking placards down for a minute\nand sing about something they\u2019ve actually experienced. The good stuff is\nreally quite good: it\u2019s just that the bad\nbits are dreadful. - Duncan Casey\nFIGHTING\nFICTION\nA LESSER OF\nTWO EVILS\nEP\nOMFGZ watch out for the monkey!!!! Oh... right it\u2019s a t-shirt, I knew that...\n\n"

Hold the fan-fares. It\u2019s been a few weeks\ninto term now, I\u2019ve remembered how to hold a pen and\nmake vague gestures with it\non paper, and I can now hold a conversation with someone for longer than\nthree minutes. I\u2019m a student again.\nPhew.\nFor a dangerously long period over\nthe summer, I began to live a bit like\nthose people do on television some-times. You know, on the news? When\nthey interview people on the street?\nThose people. With their ironed\nclothes and their opinion on Gordon\nBrown, and the like. One day I went\nand bought a copy of Guardian and actually read the stories rather than just\nlooking at the pictures. Fortunately,\nthat all passed and I\u2019m back to sitting\nin my underwear writing out equations\nand growing my disgusting, filthy hair.\nGod. Student life, eh.\nAnyway, as I say, I\u2019m settled down\nnow and boy isn\u2019t it great to be back.\nIsn\u2019t it, though? I mean, I bet you\u2019ve\nreally missed people like me, the c**ts\nwho write for felix because we\u2019re under the impression we have an opinion\nworth communicating. Last week\u2019s\nscintillating discussion about how the\nBritish like to discuss the weather, say,\nor the detailed explanation of why it\u2019s\ncrucial that we... the cameras... surveillance society. Oh, it\u2019s all so fresh and\nnew, I bet it\u2019s hard to pick a favourite.\nMuch easier to just regurgitate the\nopinion in the Union as if it\u2019s your own.\nAfter all, that\u2019s what felix is here for.\nChrist, I hate this place. More specifically \u2013 I hate you. You really are utterly\npathetic. I mean all of you.\nThe sex bomb that commented last\nweek with the spectacularly obvious\nadvice of \u201cLooking for women? Try\nplaces that women go to.\u201d is just the\ntip of the lopsided and melting idiot\niceberg. I watched the students collect\nagain in groups after a long summer\nspent thinking up things to say about\nhow they spent their summer, and this\ngreat thing happens \u2013 the women become performers. So you get this group\nof students, right, and it\u2019s the usual\nlot \u2013 there\u2019s the indie-style guy who\u2019s\nof some kind of Asian descent, there\u2019s\nthe shorter English chap who\u2019s balding\nslightly and so ugly that mirrors actually peel off their silvery backing when\nhe approaches them, and then the\nthird guy is generally plucked straight\nout of a Microsoft advert. Right. And\nthey\u2019ve got a female friend. So they\nmeet her, and they spectate. It\u2019s an informal group conversation, but after\nten seconds the blokes have arranged\nin a semicircle around her and they\u2019re\nnodding sagely like she\u2019s conducting a\nroundtable discussion about how great\nit is to have breasts.\nAnd you know what? They\u2019re all\nthinking the same thing. They\u2019re all\nthinking, like good old Mister Lowe\nevidently does, that their dick is the\nstraightest. That they\u2019re out there.\nLowe might think that you need to get\nout of Imperial to do it, but the effect\nis much the same \u2013 you all think you\u2019re\nShaft.\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you\npeople. Honest to God. The freshers\nhave an excuse, they\u2019ve still not realised that all of their ideas are about as\ngood as Arsejuice Cola, but we\u2019re talking students in their third or fourth\nyears here, students who still think\nthey have dress sense, that they\u2019re\nthe only ones with the perfect career\nplanned out, and that the anecdote\nthey tell about that guy they knew in\nsecondary school who did the thing at\nthat place where Miley Cyrus likes to\ngo is remotely interesting.\nIt\u2019s not interesting. You are not inter-esting. Neither are you cool, or alterna-tive, or valuable as a human being in\nany way. The sooner you realise that,\nthe sooner we can all get back to our\ndepressing, math-filled lives. Coming\nto Imperial to find yourself is like hosting an AA meeting in a bar. It\u2019s coun-ter-productive, you\u2019ll look like a moron\nand it\u2019ll all end with you drinking your\nproblems away.\nNot that that\u2019s a bad thing necessar-ily. I\u2019m just saying, skip out the bit that\nrequires effort.\nWelcome back, all. Missed you.\nRyhs Davies: As Mad as Bicycles!\n\u201cWeird people have\nmore fun. They\ndo weird stuff,\nmeet other weird\npeople and ... do\neven weirder stuff\ntogether\u201d\nS\nalutations and good (insert\ntime of day here) to you all.\nFirstly, congratulations are\nin order. Belated, admittedly I slept in...for a week.\nTo second years and above, well done\non passing your exams and returning\nto the warm, fuzzy breast of the College. To all you lovely freshers (yes,\nthat means you), you have my felici-tations in the felix on your entry into\none of the greatest universities in the\nuniverse. So yes, welcome to Imperial!\nI thought I\u2019d start the year off with a\nbang. Literally. You have three seconds\nbefore it explodes. Three, two, one...\noh, and good luck.\nOk, who actually just put down their\nfelix? Own up. Ok, less bang, more\nwhimper. But this brings me on quite\nnicely to my actual point. I, myself, am\na second year, wizened by experience,\nphysically crippled by excessive book\nborrowing \u2013 well, a little. This time,\nlast year, I was a fresh-faced fresher. To\nthe retrospective shame of the Admissions Office, I knew next to nothing.\nBut this, I did know; I had a plan.\nIn my school-days, I was regarded as\nsmart, affable but generally a bit of a\noddball. I don\u2019t know why. It may have\nhad something to do with what I did\nwith the squirrels (in my defence, they\nnever found the bodies). But I decided\nthat I would change this perception\npeople had of me upon coming to Imperial. I could start anew! I would still\nbe friendly, of course, but I would be\nquiet. I would take a back seat. I would\nblend seamlessly into the crowd. I\nwould become as boring as the word\nbrown \u2013 which is possibly the most\ndull word in the English language.\nThis was my plan and I stuck to it like\njam to the ceiling. But I soon realised\nthat the problem with being boring is...\nit is incredibly boring! Apart from the\noccasional flash mob, crowds don\u2019t do\nmuch \u2013 they just occupy space \u2013 and\nas an individual in said crowd, you are\na nothing. So, a dilemma arose; plain is\nboring, exciting is weird. What was a\nfresher to do?\nIn truth, it was ridiculously simple.\nWe only get so much time on this big\nblue marble so it\u2019s important that we\nmake the most of it. If you do something weird, at least you\u2019re doing\nsomething. If you\u2019re doing nothing to\npreserve your image, in the end, you\u2019re\nstill just doing nothing. And doing\nsomething beats doing nothing every\ntime. So I gave up my intricately devised scheme and decided to be my-self. Yes, cheesy, I know, but everybody\nelse was taken. I did what I naturally do\n(I can\u2019t go into the particulars for fear\nof incrimination), and, in the course\nof things, I attained a more, ah, interesting perception. Thus, I stumbled\nupon my second epiphany of Freshers\u2019\nWeek.\nWeird people have more fun. They\ndo weird stuff, meet other weird people and (with any luck) do even weirder\nstuff together. As I reasoned earlier,\ndoing something beats doing nothing.\nWell, doing something weird counts\nfor double! I\u2019m not one for giving ad-vice, but you should definitely try\nsomething weird every now and then.\nYou\u2019ll live longer, thus you\u2019ll have more\ntime for doing weird things.\nI have a feeling I\u2019m preaching to the\nconverted, even if they don\u2019t know it\nyet. Science students are always a little different \u2013 making numbers dance\nagainst their will, quoting Monty Python verbatim, gently spooning the\nLaws of Nature \u2013 and Imperial is no\ndifferent. Cumulatively, that\u2019s more\nthan a hundred metric crazies of weird.\nWith so much insanity bubbling under\nthe surface, it makes for a pretty interesting place.\nWhatever you do, make sure you do\nsomething. If you\u2019ve been to the Freshers\u2019 Fair, you know you\u2019re spoilt for\nchoice. Doing something makes you\ninteresting (or weird, amoral, criminal\n\u2013 delete as appropriate), and makes\nImperial interesting. Which not only\nkeeps me entertained in the short term\nbut also helps draw in more interesting\npeople for the future.\n\n"
