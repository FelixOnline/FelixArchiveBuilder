It's all getting tedious and the whole subject must be\nboring everyone else as much as it is boring me.\nSurely he has better ways to spend his time\nthan getting worked up over the state of a College newspaper. He can feel so strongly\nabout something and yet all he can do about it is\nwrite a letter. He hasn't tried talking to me about\nhis grievances and if he bothered to spend a bit\nmore time in Felix than the 30 seconds it takes to\nhand in his letter, he might find out why the\nmagazine is the way that it is.\nMaybe then his arguments would carry a bit\nmore weight and I could have a bit more respect\nfor them. As it is, he is terribly uninformed and\ndoesn't seem to understand quite what the\nposition of Editor means. I was elected to edit\nFelix, just as Andy, Dave and Charlie were\nelected to run the Union. We all were chosen\nbecause the students believed that we could do\nthe job. The content and style of Felix is my\ndecision just as the shape of the Union is the\ndecision of Andy, Dave and Charlie.

It has been very rewarding.\nI would like to end by wishing Owain and the\nrest of the Felix team all the best for next year.\nThe last issue of Felix this year Will be out on\nthe last day of term.\nThe deadline for letters for the last issue is Monday, 5pm "

    "content": "10 Clubs and Societies\nNo Sea Too Rough...\n...on the Imperial College Underwater Club Easter Tour 1994 To The Lizard,\nCornwall. Report by Jason Grey. (Edited by Douglas Donaldson)\nOnce again the Easter break saw us packing a minibus full of dive kit and whizzing down to\nthe Eastern tip of the Lizard Peninsula. The sun\nshone strongly and was accompanied by the\nabsence of the curse of all dive trips-strong or\ngale force winds. Yes, our Lord was smiling on\nus and showing us how good this trip was going\ntobe..Not!\nSo, nous somme s reveille s Sunday and\nlooked out of our caravan windows to a wet and\nwindy day. The good Lord in his infinite\nwisdom had toyed with us and, just like Jim\nMorrison who quickly whipped the towel from\nhimself briefly exposing his most private of\nparts in front of an excited audience, God had\nmade it plain to us that he was toying with us\nand that was all we were likely to see of the sun.\nTradition has it that all novices shall be\nde flowered in Porthoustock, a sheltered bay\nwhere they experience a gentle introduction to\nthe reality of British diving. It is a suitable site to\nget scuba virgins in the water and progress\nthrough their training.\nHaving arrived at the site and learned of\nworsening weather later in the day, the old hands\nignored that strongest of impulse to drive to the\nnearest pub and hold the landlord's wife and\nchildren hostage until he agreed to open up and\nserve us and selflessly sacrificed ourselves by\nagreeing to dive. Why? I can't honestly recall\nnow, but it has to have something to do with\ntaking a novice in the water for the first time and\nseeing their eyes light up with excitement as you\ndive some sludgy piece of kelp. It seems to take\nabout 20 dives for a novice to realise when s/ he\nis diving to something that is utterly and\ncompletely uninteresting. Eventually they too\nwill look at the site and quickly make a mental\nvote for the pub!\nMy novice, John, and I dived last. It was so\nunpleasant in the surge and swell that we left the\nbay with its rocks and kelp and the odd\ninteresting feature for the barren desert of sand.\nAlthough this appeared to be a master stroke, it\ndid not explain the sudden deterioration in\nunderwater viz. (visibility for the diving\nun blessed) we experienced. All became apparent\nwhen we dragged ourselves on all fours up to the\nshingle bank at the shore line. We looked up to\nsee a JCB digging up massive rocks, leaving a sizeable slick. Nice work by the locals in ruining\nan already dubious dive site.\nThe next morning revealed another horrible\nday. The first of three dives was a reef south of\nFalmouth involving gullies and rocks with high\nkelp. This dive gave the novices more to see in\nterms of flora, fauna and interactive nature\ndiving which roughly translated means spotting\nsomething interesting and playing with it. John\nand I came across several dogfish (related to the\nshark, but much smaller).\nMeanwhile those lucky sports divers went off\nto dive the Volnay, a wrecked ammunition ship\n\u2022 ... ' ' > r* off Maenporth. We dived this wreck again on\nthe following day for training purposes and, after\na brief exploration we started our ascent,\npractising the sharing air drill that is such an\nimportant skill to the diver. This accomplished,\nwe surfaced for the boat trip home. At one point\nwe were running with the wind and sea at our\nback and, as the channel narrowed, the wave in\nfront of us towered up above us until the wall of\nwater was at least 30 feet from crest to trough.\nTimes like that really focus your mind on to just\nhow powerful water can be.\nWednesday morning, with the winds very\nmuch stronger than they had been, we hurried\noff early to Falmouth. As we waited on the\nslip way, two of our party had a discussion:\n\"Wonder where the van is?\"\n\"Oh probably in a ditch somewhere!\"\nThe prophet of doom was actually right. We\ngot a message that the van had in fact ended up\nin a ditch on Goonhilly Downs but, thankfully,\nall were safe. I kept looking at the prophet of\ndoom to make sure his dive knife was not a large\nscythe. \"Hi, my name's Reaper, but you can call\nme Grim.\" Nope, no horsemen around.\nThose of us with enough kit dived the\nPeterson in Falmouth Bay. We managed to find\nthe end of the wreck where the chains are\nheaped in a big pile. We had no problem in\nspotting the massive co nger eels that inhabit this\npile of chain. They are big, about 10 inches\ndiameter and probably a length of six feet or so.\nThey demand respect and they got it. We\nreturned to the campsite after a fairly interesting\nday for all concerned; some stayed in Falmouth\nto sample the local beer fest for a while.\nOn Friday we planned to dive the Stanwood\nin Falmouth Harbour. But our DM took one of\nour motto's to heart: \"Plan the dive and f**k the\nplan\" and decided to dive the Peterson out in the\nbay. Conditions in the bay were not at all like\nthey were supposed to be and after chugging\naround on the surface, trying to work up the\ncourage to dive, sense prevailed and we beat a retreat for the harbour. So, we packed up early\nthat Friday.\nThe evening saw the official award ceremony\nand meal. Here are some of the highlights.\nJohn Cleese award for \"statin' the bleed in' obvious\": Dave Taylor for shouting \"wave\"\nevery time he spotted a wave.\nQuote of the trip (anon): \"Probably in a ditch\nsomewhere.\"\nOn a more serious note, we should feel very\nproud of our club. Never have we had such\nconsistently bad conditions; we have dived and\nboated through rougher weather, but not for so\nlong. It was cold and miserable, but still we\nachieved a lot. It is obvious that we are growing\nin experience and skill. When I acted dead for\nthe rescue drill and recovery to the boat, I was\ndamned impressed with the standard of rescue\nand care that I got. Let us continue to practice a skill which will hopefully only ever be practised.\nSome people who read this may well wonder\nwhy we dive. At the surface all is bedlam. The\nsea is rough, the boat is pitching and rolling, the\nwind is biting cold and struggling into heavy kit\ntakes a huge effort. Yet underwater there is\npeace and tranquillity. The near weightlessness\nis calming and what may be just a pile of scrap\nmetal on land takes on a very different\nperspective underwater.\nWe more than earned our motto \"No Sea Too\nRough...\" during this week. If we can dive\nthrough that, then most other dive able conditions\nwill prove to be easy for us, but still it is\nimportant to respect the power of the sea.\nTo find out what the societies are up to this week, turn to page 13\n\n"

    "content": "2 News\nResearch Councils to Seek Quality\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nThe higher education funding councils last week called for more quality and less quantity from university\nresearchers.\nThe councils warned they will\nno longer consider the number of\nresearch papers published by staff\nwhen awarding funding to a university department. Instead, grants will\nbe allocated according to the quality\nof a department's research.\nThe practice of assessing performance by a publication count has\nput university staff under immense\npressure to publish their work as\noften as possible. According to\nBahram Bekhradnia, Director of\nPolicy for the English Funding\nCouncil, this has forced researchers\ninto \"premature publication, trivial\narticles and breaking up a publication into a number of parts\".\nThe next assessment of\nuniversity departments in 1996 will\nrely on panels of academics and\nindustrialists to judge the quality of\nresearch. A selection of staff mem-be rs' best publications will be submitted to the panels, with unpublished work such as industrial\npatents also taken into account. This\nmove is in response to criticism that\npure research is currently favoured\nby funding bodies over work with\ncommercial applications.\nThere is concern, however, that\nthe ruling will cause the gap in\nfunding between leading institutions\nand other universities to widen\nfurther, effectively forcing some\nuniversities to drop research\nactivities entirely.\nDemand for University Courses Slows\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe rate of increase of university\napplications has dropped this year,\ncontrary to projections.\nFigures released by the\nUniversities and Colleges\nAdmissions Service (UCAS)\nrevealed that 378,150 candidates\nhave applied for degree courses this\nsummer. This compares to a figure\nof 377,767 applications at the same\ntime last year. The rise amounts to\njust 0.1%, well below the 3%\ngrowth predicted by experts.\nStudent numbers have nearly\ndoubled since 1988, during six\nyears of rapid growth in\napplications.\nThese figures are said to prove\nthat the Government has already\nachieved its targets for University\nexpansion. Ministers are now concentrating on increasing recruitment\nby colleges of further education.\nThe Service has attributed this\nyear's levelling off of the expansion\nto the upturn in the economy\nencouraging more school-leave rs to\napply for jobs rather than go to\nUniversity.\nPotential students are also likely\nto be put off by the Government's decision to cut maintenance grants\nby 10% annually for the next three\nyears. UCAS accepted the\ndetrimental effect of this reduction,\nbut said that the \"saturation point\"\nin demand for University courses\nmay have been reached.\nThis is the first year in which the\nnew UCAS applications system has\nbeen in operation, using the same\nsystem for applications to both 'old'\nand 'new' universities. Previously\nthey had been dealt with separately\nby UCCA and PCAS.\nThe figures also show the wide\ncultural distribution of applicants.\nOverseas applicants numbered\n35,567, making up 9.4% of the\ntotal. Of these, 16,686 were from\nother countries in the European\nUnion.\nThe most popular course was\nteacher training, with a total of\n162,459 applications. The other\nfavourites among young people\nwere business and management\nwith 140,892 applications, law with\n111,983 applications, computer\nstudies with 66,883, medicine with\n59,817 and english with 58,554\napplications.\nFREE DELIVERY\nOPEN: 11.30am TILL 1.00am \u2022 7 DAYS A WEEK\nIN LESS THAN 30 MINUTES.

    "content": "20 Opinion\nNo Storage Will He Ever Shut Up?\nDear Beccy,\nRecently there have been quite a few\ncomplaints concerning accommodation.\nUnfortunately, I have to add another. The\nCollege boasts that 40% or so of its students are\nfrom overseas. Still, the Accommodation Office\nhas failed to reserve any room for summer\nstorage. Do they think that parents come with\ntheir car from the Continent and Singapore to\npick up the belongings of their offspring at the\nend of term? I think it is the responsibility of the\nCollege to provide storage facilities over the\nsummer for overseas students. It is enough\nworry to find accommodation for the next\nacademic year without having to find storage\nroom for the end of term during exam time. I am\nsure that most people would be willing to pay a moderate amount to have their things stored and\nso there might even be a profit in there for the\nAccommodation Office.\nI would also like to repeat that short-term\naccommodation at prices lower than \u00a320 should\nbe provided for those poor souls who have to\ntake res its in September. Ripping off the tourists\nis one thing, ripping off one's own students is\nanother one completely.\nI hope that the people responsible give some\nthought to what they would expect if their kids\nwere in such a situation.\nYours,\nKristine J Vaaler\nDear Beccy,\nI honestly didn't intend to write this letter,\nbut finally realised I could not let your editorial\nin 1001 go unchallenged. Short of a ten page\narticle on the Wonderful World of Macabre in\nthis issue (joke, Beccy, not a real suggestion),\nthere will be no more. As you yourself said, we\nrun the risk of going round in circles. You have,\nas I have come to expect, completely missed the\npoint of my letter in a hurried attempt to go on\nthe defensive. Taking the Crossword\nCompetition as an example, I clearly agreed that\nit deserved a mention and you obviously don't need to be an 'avid crossword er' to read it. The\nquestion is one of balance as I thought I had\nmade abundantly clear. It is ludicrous to have\nFelix so weighed down with reviews and\nfeatures at the expense of news.\nAs it happens, the features last week were\npretty good, but Felix as a whole was let down\nby the usual glut of reviews and a very long-winded article on a Peruvian Nursery (it's ironic\nhow many trees must have been lost to print that\narticle from Third World First). Again, it\ndeserved space but not as much as it got. There\nis a bit more to editing than checking spelling. It\nwas also nice to see a news article on the\nexpulsion of Ronnie Wong on 16th May. Next\nyou'll be telling us that we won the Second\nWorld War. Old news is no news.\nThe reason why it has taken this long for me\nto write is that I foolishly thought that, given the\ncomplaints and mumbling s over the year, things\nwere bound to get better. Ah, the naivety of\nyouth. If I had known that Felix would continue\ndown your chosen path all year, pen would have\nfound paper a lot sooner. Finally, as mentioned\nby my good friend Hamish last week in his\nspoof letter, I did indeed mean 'Fenland\nMountain Rescue Service'. 'Finland (sic)\nMountain Rescue Service' is not yet in common\nusage. I wonder if less charitable people than\nmyself will bring 'couldn't organise an\nanniversary issue of Felix' into College\nlanguage.\nYours sincerely,\nSimon Baker.\nInternational Nite '94 Videotapes\nCopies of the video recordings of the 1994 International Nite are\navailable from the Union Office. Interested parties are to see\nCharles Leary, Deputy President (Clubs & Socs).\nCheques for \u00a38 must be made payable to 'ICU OSC.\nIf he wasn't in the US,\nJack would probably\nbe watching the foot ie in DaVinci's!

Josephine Barstow, clenched in\nvoice and posture, is the Kostelnicka, the\ntortured matriarch who convinces herself it is for\nthe best to drown her foster-daughter Jenufa's illegitimate baby.

Perhaps due to her approach\n(reduced strings, harsh brass) or to the latest\ninvestigations into Janacek's original intentions,\nthere was none of the occasional suggestions of\nPuccini and Strauss that can be heard on Sir\nCharles Mackerras's Decca recording. Only the\nAct I arrival of Jano (rattling through the\ndaffodils) disappoints with insufficient heady\nsweetness from the pit. Strange that one of the\nmost ecstatic entries in opera should be not for a triumphant lover or a victorious warrior, but for\na young boy who has learnt to read.\nElsewhere the flow is sure, with flashes of\nwarmth from the first horn and chilly gusts from\nthe flutes.

Upon reflection, this\nprobably wasn't over an attempted parody of\n'Why Don't You?', unlike the eclectic Julian\nCope whose tyrannical prancing would not have\nbeen amiss in that most uplifting of children's broadcasts. His appearance on the main stage,\nbulging unashamedly through an understated\nlittle yellow jockstrap had a few Christians on\ntheir knees in apocalyptic al expectation as well\nthey might.

This is a story about the\ninteraction between the three people, apparently\nwith nothing in common who immediately\nbecome friends after a single meal at a sporting\nclub.\nThe title of the film Le Parfum D 'Yvonne,\nIII ; \\ ;\n!\nIII ; \\ ;\n!\n1\n1\nSnow White\nVoices: Adriana Caselotti, Harry Stockwell,\nLucille Laverne\nDirector: David Hand\nWalt Disney's classic film Snow White And The\nSeven Dwarfs has returned to bless our screens\nonce more for the summer holidays. It has been\ncleaned up using the latest computer techniques\nand it is now looking almost as good as new.\nIf you are unfamiliar with this fairy tale by\nthe brothers Grimm, it is about Snow White\nwho is despised by the Queen, her evil\nstepmother, since she desires to be the fairest of\nthem all.\nAfter escaping into the forest, she stumbles\nupon the dwarfs' home. She hides here from the\nQueen, takes care of the dwarfs and looks after\ntheir neglected home. However, she is still not\nsafe from her mother's tyranny.\nThis film is definitely a must to see. I know\nit's for kids but this film certainly has Walt\nDisney's magic.\nMagpie\nOpens nationwide on 22nd July\nYvonne's Perfume, is a bit of a mystery. What is\nit that attracts two people to each other? With\nVictor it's Yvonne's sensuality and her beauty.\nThe film has a very sparse plot, as the people\nlive from day to day, the script flows from\nminute to minute. All their lives have hidden\nsecrets: is Victor a coward for not wanting to\nfight for his country or is he just delaying an\ninevitability; why is Doctor Meinthe's nickname\nQueen Astrid? Does it really matter?\nThe cinematography for Le Parfum\nBad Girls\nStarring: Madeleine Stowe, Andie MacDowell,\nDrew Barrymore, Mary Stuart Masterson\nDirector: Jonathan Kaplan\nBad Girls! Bad Movie! Which illustrates\nbeautifully Rule One of film naming: Never,\nnever put an adjective like 'bad' in the title of a film that isn't at least half way to being decent.\nThe cast is good, Madeleine Stowe, Andie\nMacDowell, Drew Barrymore and even a favourite of mine, Mary Stuart Masterson. The\nidea is at least novel as far as Westerns are\nconcerned, namely four female heroes/heroines,\nbut in much the same way as Mario Van\nPeeble's Posse (FELiX 981) it just doesn't come\nclose to all the potential.\nNow maybe I wasn't expecting much and I certainly didn't enter it in a good mood, i.e. two\nminutes after the film had started, as an old fat\nAmerican had used the age old excuse of\nignorance for cue jumping for the popcorn; but\neither way I was sorely disappointed.\nThe story was just too boring with what you\nassumed were amusing little side-plot becoming\nthe main crux of the film.\nD 'Yvonne is beautifully set, the background\nshots of the area have an appealing attraction.\nThis is an excellent film, erotic and sensual, with\nvery strong characters and this is what makes the\nfilm so appealing. All the characters have\naspirations of being something that they are not,\nthough the laid back isolated lives they live\nprevent them following their dreams.\nMagpie\nOpens on 2nd September at the Lumiere,\nChelsea Cinema and Renoir.\nSurprisingly director Jon Kaplan's other\nfilms include The Accused, Project X and\nrecently Unlawful Entry. The Accused was\nstorming and while Unlawful Entry did well at\nthe box office, it wasn't technically good. After\nthis excuse for an effort we can only assume that\npoor Jon is now definitely on the decline.\nThe trouble was that it's all too damn clich ed. He just doesn't create the feel of a western, the\ngrit, the suspense, the realism. It's as if he'd seen a western once and thought that it'd be a fun idea to give one a try, with abysmal\nconsequences.\nNever mind Jon, at least you got the chance\nto direct Maddy Stowe again (something that a lot of hot-blooded males would give each others\nright eyes for).\nThe hook line for the film is: 'The only way\nthey stand a chance, is to stand together.' This is\nobviously so that no one actress has to take the\nblame.\nHowever, it's not all gloom on the Western\nfront, at least Maverick comes out soon!\n(Bonnie &) Clyde\nOpens Nationwide 29th July.\nNext Week: Look out for a review of Robocop 3\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nof the jointly run Physics with Performance\nStudies course, which is now coming to the end\nof its first year. Dickins believes that there are\nalso opportunities for collaboration in\nperformance, perhaps in works that are too big\nfor either institution to tackle on its own. \"A piece that is dear to my heart is Schoenberg's Gurrelieder, which is scored for enormous\nforces. It's everything that people don't expect\nof Schoenberg; it's his very early style, like all\nthe best bits of Wagner put together. That would\nbe exactly the piece for a collaboration with the\nRoyal College or another university.\"\nA previous series of joint concerts in the\nsummer of 1992 remains for Dickins a high\npoint of his time with ICSO. \"We did a series of\nVerdi Requiems, two in this country, one at the\nRoyal College and one in Cambridge. This was\nin collaboration with a Hungarian choral society\nwho were quite magnificent. We then went over\nto Hungary and did another performance of the\nVerdi in the Liszt Academy in Budapest. It was\njam-packed. There were people standing and\nthey went berserk at the end of the performance,\nas I think we did; there were an awful lot of\ntears, it had been a very stressful time but it was\nthe most magical, wonderful performance and\nthat was a very big highlight.\" Sponsorship for\nthe Hungarian tour was generously provided by\nthe accountants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu but,\neven so, the difficulties of funding and\norganisation were staggering. \"I hope we will\nlook at the idea of foreign tours again,\" says\nDickins, \"but finance is the problem.\"\nThe Physics with Performance Studies course,\nrun jointly by Imperial College and the Royal\nCollege of Music, offers top level training in\nboth physics and music for people who don't want to be pigeonholed by their choice of\ndegree. \"For many students whose interests are\nnot solely within the arts but span both the arts\nand the sciences, it's an opportunity to extend\ntheir work in both these areas,\" says Dr Janet\nRitterman, director of the RCM.\nThe first two students to take the course are\nreaching the end of their first year. James\nMarchese, a clarinettist and a former pupil at the\nRCM Junior Department, took maths, physics\nand chemistry A levels. He was originally going\nto come to Imperial College to do physics until\nRichard Dickins, who teaches at the Junior\nDepartment, mentioned the new course to him.\n\"He said: 'We've got this course running, how\nabout it?' It was just perfect because I wanted to\ncontinue my music to the highest level.\"\nEd Bale, a violinist, studied maths, physics\nand music at A level and spent a year at the\nGuildhall before coming to IC. \"I decided I wanted to do something else apart from music. I was used to having music as something extra to\nother things I was doing; I can't do music all the\ntime. Last year, if you didn't practise for six\nhours a day then you weren't very busy. I'm much busier now, which I enjoy.\"\nIn theory, the four-year structure of the new\ncourse will allow students to reach the same\nSome years ago Neville Blyth, a former\nacademic who has been heavily involved in\nmusic at Imperial College, bequeathed a six-figure sum to the College, to be put towards the\ncost of a music building. Given the number of\nmusicians now on the campus, Dickins stresses\n\"the need for music practice rooms, for a smaller\nrecital hall and a rehearsal hall for the choir, who\nare at the moment extremely poorly housed in a lecture theatre in Mechanical Engineering which\njust isn't big enough and doesn't have the right\nacoustic.\" The money has been invested and is\ngrowing and hopefully the necessary balance\nwill eventually be found.\nEven with new premises, the Great Hall\nwould have to remain the venue for ICSO\nconcerts. The orchestra has for a while been\nable to tackle large-scale symphonic works and\nthere are distinct threads running through the\nrepertoire since the early 80s. There is much\nRussian music - Tchaikovsky, Rimsky\nKorsakov, Rachmaninov, Shostakovich and\nProkofiev have all been played. Dickins outlines\nthe philosophy behind these choices: \"Our\nrepertoire is a reflection of what I think the\norchestra is going to achieve best. There's little\ndoubt in my mind that the big late 19th and early\n20th century Russian pieces work particularly\nwell with an orchestra like ICSO; they're\ndemanding but not too demanding, they're\ncolourful, they're emotional.\" And there are also\nthe first five Mahler symphonies. \"A bit of a passion, yes. The first piece of his I conducted\nwas the First Symphony many years ago here at\nlevel as their single-honours counterparts on the\nnormal three-year physics BSc. This was a crucial factor for James. \"You could still do a physics PhD or an MSc afterwards,\" he points\nout, \"or you could do a postgraduate course at\nthe RCM, or you could go into any field that a physics graduate goes into.\"\nEven with the extra year and reduced\nlaboratory work, the course is demanding.\n\"We've done all the lectures that the normal\nundergraduate physicists have done,\" says Ed,\n\"and then there's the practice on top of that\".\nThe music component also includes the study of\ntechniques such as harmony and counterpoint. In\ncommon with RCM first years, Ed and James\nhave already had to produce pastiche pieces - a piano sonata movement in the style of Haydn\nand a two-part invention in the style of Bach.\nBoth find that being able to play the piano\ncomes in useful here, although a second\ninstrument is not required for the course\nThe organisational difficulties of coordinating the timetables of the two institutions\nmean that the course is not likely to take on\nlarge numbers of students. But out of 30\nhopefuls, only one has been offered a place next\nOctober. \"They get rid of most of the applicants\nthrough the RCM auditions, that's the toughest\nbit,\" says James. No concessions are made and\ninstrumentalists must be of the same standard as\nthose accepted for the normal BMus course.\nImperial.\" That was in the spring of 1983; three\nyears later, in a joint venture, ICSO and IC\nChoir performed the gargantuan Second. \"They\nthought that I was completely off my head\nchoosing this piece, but it was a marvellous\nconcert and it seemed that people of this age,\nexploring music like that, have something very\nspecial to give to it and the performance was\nmuch greater than the sum of the constituent\nparts.\" Having reached Five, does he plan to do\nSix? \"It's very much on the cards, yes. I think\nit'll take me a couple of years to recover from\nFive, but yes.\" The other Mahler symphony\nDickins is keen to conduct is the unfinished\nTenth, in the Deryck Cooke performing version.\nThis work has gained increasing acceptance over\nthe last fifteen years, due in no small part to the\nadvocacy of Simon Rattle. (\"To play for him\nwas and is I'm sure still, a most extraordinary\nexperience,\" says Dickins, as he recalls playing\nthe clarinet in the Hampshire Youth Orchestra\nunder the direction of the 19 year old Rattle. \"He\nwas great then and he's only got better.\") Much\nless morbid and apocalyptic than its predecessor,\nMahler's Tenth is a forward-looking yet\napproachable work, firmly rooted in the 20th century. \"I think it's a magnificent piece and\nwould love to do it,\" enthuses Dickins, \"but that\nprobably would kill us all!\"\nMany thanks to Anne Barrett, Eric Brown,\nRichard Dickins, Chris Purvis, Ainslee Rutledge,\nSarah Too and James White for their help in the\npreparation of this article.\nPhysics with Performance Studies students\nJames Marchese (left) and Ed Bale\nBreaking out of the pigeonholes\nSome of this summer's films are reviewed on pages 14 & 15\n\n"

    "content": "14 Reviews\nThumbelina and the smoothing talking Mr Beetle strut their stuff\nThumbelina\nVoices: Jodi Benson, Carol Channing,\nJohn Hurt\nDirectors: Don Bluth, Gary Goldman\nThe thing about going to see an animated film is\nthat the auditorium is almost always packed with\nscreaming kiddies throwing popcorn at each\nother and constantly talking. This film is no\nexception. Thumbelina is an interpretation of the\noriginal Hans Christian Anderson tale by Don\nBluth (the man who gave us An American Tale).\nThe story tells of the adventures of a tiny girl\nwho is desperate for a blok e of about her size so\nthat she can live with happily ever after in true\nfairy tale style. Surprisingly enough there aren't many dish y two inch tall men around and\nThumbelina begins to get very worried that she\nwill spend the rest of her life on the shelf. Then\narrives Cornelius a fairy prince that happens to\nbe just the right size for Thumbelina. They\nrather predictably fall in love but, of course, the\nstory does not end here.\nThumbelina goes on to be abducted by Mrs\nDelores Toad and her Singers de Espana. The\nflamenco frog attempts to exploit Thumbelina's singing talents claiming that she will make\nThumbelina a 'star'. She almost succeeds until\nshe attempts to marry off Thumbelina to one of\nher sons. Thumbelina escapes with the aid of a passing swallow who tells her that she should\nalways follow her heart. Thumbelina then gets\nchatted up by a smooth talking beetle, escapes\nmarriage to a mole and eventually is rescued by\nPrince Cornelius.\nThe whole film has a truly continental style\nwith accents from all over the place cropping up.\nThe most confusing is probably that of the frogs,\nwho can't seem to decide whether they are\nSpanish or Caribbean. The beetle obviously hails\nfrom Manhattan and the swallow sounds\ndistinctly French. The best section of animation\nis in the first five minutes with a breath-taking\n3D flight of a swallow through the city streets.\nThe rest is a little mediocre with bland songs and\nconfusing characters. The whole thing just drags\non and the songs are too repetitive. Come back\nWalt Disney, all is forgiven.\nLynn B! Opens nationwide on 29th July.\n| 111\nThe Beverly Hillbillies\nStarring: Lily Tomlin, Erica Eleniak, Jim Varney\nDirector: Penelope Spheeris\nIn the strange world of Hollywood, a sure thing\nis the commodity every studio is searching for.\nAnd old TV shows are just about one of the\nsurest things you can get, especially ones of the\ncarat of The Beverly Hillbillies. One of the most\npopular shows in American history, Twentieth\nCentury Fox must have felt very happy with the\nwhole project. The massive success of The\nAddams Family, Dennis, Teenage Mutant Ninja\nTurtles, the Star Trek movies and the upcoming\nFlintstones must be an even more bitter blow to\nTwentieth Century Fox than the lukewarm\nreception at the US box office.\nThe reasons for the flop of The Beverly\nHillbillies are glaringly apparent from the\nopening credits. The theme song, one of the\nshows most familiar features, is reproduced as\nclose to the original as anything can be without\nactually being it. The viewer feels immediately\nuncomfortable; the original singer would have\nbeen fine, even a modern cover version would\nhave been acceptable. But this ham-fist ed attempt to trick the audience is doomed to\nbackfire. My heart sank when I realised that the\nperformances were also going to consist of\nnothing more than highly paid mimicry.\nThe story, while remaining that of the TV\nseries, is somehow made less believable or\nlikeable by the money thrown at its re-telling.\nThe film attempts to make the first 25 minutes\ntell a story that the original told in the opening\ntitles - a major error of judgement. However,\nwhen the story does take off, it is puerile and\nunworthy of mention; suffice to say that Jed\nwants to get wed and all manner of tricksters\nwant their hands on his new found wealth.\nThe comic talents of Jim Varney are wasted\non clumsy parody and even the great Lily\nTomlin only just manages to rise above the\ninsignificance of her role. Erica Eleniak once\nagain proves her talents to be over-rated.\nThe thing that made The Beverly Hillbillies\nfunny in the Sixties and funny today was the\nsense that the naivety they displayed could have\nbeen genuine. They were funny because the\nplace they had moved to was as weird as they\nwere. It was a satire not just of excessive\nrural is m but of the same excess in urbanism that\nthe more bizarre aspects of LA life represents.\nObviously those responsible for this creation\nmissed the second part of the joke. The typical\ncountry person in this movie gets a laugh by\nfarting and burping.\nThe whole agenda of the movie seems to be\nthat the Clampetts will be able to better themselves in the big city; we end with Ellie May\npushed into a skin tight dress. Call me an old\ntraditionalist, but the Sixties way, where the\nClampetts stayed in their mansion and Ellie May\nstill looked after her animals, is the vision of\nthem I want to be left with.\nTony Grew\nNo confirmed release date.\nAll these films are to be released over the summer holiday\n\n"

Not only did their\nalbum 'Painless' get the first full marks of year,\nbut they prompted the comment: \"'Painless' is\nas close to perfect sublimity as I 've met.\" Pretty\nmeaningless, huh. Pavement, on the other hand,\nwere a band out to prove their sanity. The\nalbum, 'Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain', saw them\nadding joists rather than knocking off the edges\nof their previous work. Nevertheless, the loaded\nir revel an cy contained within the line, \"I care, I care, I really don't care, did you see the\ndrummer's hair?\" went a long way to fixing\nthem as the band for self-effacing slackers.\nBaby Chaos managed three singles during\nthis time. Producing tracks with the edge of\n'Buzz' shows that being on a major record label\nis not the dubious proposition often claimed.\nProductive in the extreme were Madder Rose. I remember buying their first single this time last\nyear yet, since then, two albums have been\nreleased. 'Panic On', the second of their\nofferings, shows them developing a style of their\nown with 'Car Song' being the most\nimmediately intense track. Frank Black's 'Teenager Of The Year' has only been out for\nthree weeks, but already it is firmly established\nas a masterful joke. 'The Vanishing Spies' is just\none track from any number that could have been\nchosen.\nSubmarine pretended to be an American\nband but were firmly British. 'Lynn Marie',\ndespite being a cover from Ultra Vivid Scene,\nremoved my heart with its sparseness. As for the\nSmashing Pumpkins, they were as fully yank ie as could be without being John Wayne. 'Siamese\nDream' is probably the album of the year, if\nsuch exists, and 'Sweet Sweet' is a little vignette\nhidden between the more muscular monsters.\nOK, so my Juliana Hatfield fixation is pretty\nserious but 'Become What You Are' has the\nultimate second side and '/ Got No Idols',\ndespite its grammatical failings, is a cry which\nwe would do well to heed. Who or what\nMichael Penn is I don't know, but 'Coal', from\nthe compilation 'Rare On Air Vol. V, is a small\nslice of what real story telling is about.\nThe Cowboy Junkies produced what has\nbeen seen as a lacklustre album with 'Crescent\nMoon, Pale Sun' but 'Ring On The SUV stands\nwith anything they have done before. Margo\nTimmins still has the voice of an angel, period.\nKurt's dead, 'All Apologies' seems fitting, even\nif it is from their MTV unplugged set. And to\nend side a, there is Lotion. 'Full Isaac' is\npacked with the lyrical quirks which make great\nalbums; 'The Love Theme from Santo Gold' is\nfrom an imaginary TV programme.\nSide b tickles into being with a track from the\nTindersticks' eponymous album, 'Her'. All\nSpanish guitars, it promotes a rare angry mood,\nredolent with domestic violence. Heading back\ninto the past, Uzi reissued their 'Sleep Asylum'\nep. Fast, automatic and wearing its age lightly,\n'Ha Ha Ha' is hewn from a psycho sky scrape. God, strange, post-modern and post\nindustrial, buzz into rebirth on 'Lazarus' from\n'The Anatomy of Addition'. And we bring you\nLush before we even bring the review. Whether\ntheir new album, 'Split', embodies their latent\npromise is a matter still to be decided. But the\ntrack 'Blackout' roars in from the horizon like a Harley D with a Ghetto Blaster strapped across\nthe petrol tank, pumping out the soundtrack from\nyour lost teen years. Hole's 'Rockstar', from\n'Live Through This', is the playful, scared litany\nof a conforming non-conformist, whilst 'Little\nMiss Information plays on words sprung from\nGrant Hart and his intelligent Nova Mob.\nThe Lemonheads 'Rest Assured' in their\n'Come On and Feel...' album - \"It's not what\nyou do to me, it's what you do without\" - too\ntrue. Primal Scream skated close to parody with\n'Rocks' but maybe I'm just too serious a young\nman. The 'No Alternatives' compilation proved\nto be a gold mine and buried in the middle was\n'Joe'd Out' from Barbara Manning. Intense\nfolk pop inspiring repetitive use of the word\ngorgeous. Penultimately come the Red House\nPainters. 'Sundays and Holidays' (an inspiring\nmulti layered acoustic strum past a mental\nhospital) from the single 'Shock Me' is beyond\nreproach before we slip, once again, into the lake\nof cool which is Yo La Tengo. Enjoy and inhale.\nThe publishers and editorial team of Felix\naccept no responsibility for the production or\ndistribution of this music cassette.\nTiNMCI is available at your nearest outlet\n\n"

    "content": "18 Reviews\nFor me, the concept of a10\" mini-album has\nalways smacked of falling between any number\nof stools; half an album without the care or a stretched single without the ideas. And so I feel\ndisappointed about this. Their last single, 'Get\nEnough', was everything that 7\" of vinyl should\nbe: sharp enough to kiss, short enough to\ninfatuate. 'Lately' just isn't in that league.\n'Can't Even Fake It' and the pouting naivety of\n'I Guess I'm Just A Little Too Sensitive' take\naway the odd breath but side one is passing too\nslow to go.\nIt could be Dominique Durand's vocals. The\ncurled French corners of her pronouncements\ncan become more forced than naturally required,\nalthough, with concentration, this should\nbecome a precious niche in a land of drawl.\nWhatever, 'Lately' does let us see Ivy in their\nproper environment; short of the mainstream,\nlonger on quiet silence. (6) Tintin\nTimeshard\nCrystal Oscillations\nThis is the first major release for this\nLiverpudlian threesome who have enjoyed\nplenty of underground success on the free\nfestival circuit for the past five or so years. In\nkeeping with their organic sound, they perform\ngenuinely live, with little reliance on taped\nbackings and if that doesn't sound impressive\njust have a listen to it. The music is built around\nlayers of keyboards, constantly evolving and\nnever getting repetitive or boring. This is\ndefinitely not a recording to chill out to, you\nhave to listen carefully to it.\nThe album contains all the festival feel of\nHawkwind, mixed with the other worldliness of\nthe Orb but with a style that is all the band's own. It has been critically acclaimed by major\nmusic press and fanzines alike and with good\nreason. It is a gem. (9) Ridley Dash\nVarious\nFire is Good\nSomewhat akin to a sawn-off shot gun, 'Fire is\nGood' raids the back catalogue of Fire Records,\nunearthing a ragged selection of masterful,\nmoth eaten and the merely unknown.\nGetting current operators into the open, the\nfirst three tracks run as standard, being from\nThrum, The Gigolo Aunts and the Nightblooms.\nFrom then on, however, the choices are\nwildcard s. Television Personalities' 'A Sense Of\nBelonging' is well within the the CND driven\n80s agitation of Billy Bragg and his ilk. And\ndoesn't it sound dated. Then bedfellows\nEugenius and Teenage Fanclub are sandwiched\naround the rough charms of Leatherface. Yet\nthey are charms; 'Not Superstitious' shouts and\nstamps but it hides a melody in the midst of the\nphlegm. The mid span is characterised by\ninteresting bands doing outlandish things.\nAnastasia Screamed, Urge Overkill and the Blue\nAeroplanes all get close to someone's heart, but\nit's not mine. Midway Still are always solid\nperformers and 'I Won't Try' sees them washed\nand dressed in clean denim.\nOf course, the whole compilation has been\nbuilding to a peak, reached with the Spacemen 3\nand their gut scraping 'Revolution'. It invades\nThe Gigolo Aunts: On Fire\nyour body, avoids your mind and makes fire\ngood. Closely followed by an under two minute\nburst from Gumball, this is the record's vein of\ndeep gold. Towards the end we have to endure\nthe unwieldy shapes of Silver Chapter, Atlantic\nand, one of my many failings, Pulp. But without\ntoo much pain we can emerge into the open with\nthe Spacemen still ringing in your extremes. (6)\nTintin\n'Fire is Good' is only available on mail order,\nprice \u00a36 from Fire Mail Order, 21a Maury Road,\nLondon, N16 7BR. Cheques payable to 'Fire\nRecords'. Price includes p&p. There is a credit\ncard number too: 081 806 9922.\nFamily Cat\nMagic Happens\nAt first sight, The Family Cat seem the\narchetypal student band: a cute and cuddly\nname, a strictly 'guitar pop only' musical policy,\ngroovy T shirts and a 'Withnail and I' reference\nin one of their songs. But, since their inception\nin the late eighties, they've been all but ignored\nby the music press and left to skulk in indie\nghetto land, whilst the likes of Shed Seven and\nthe Lemonheads receive praise but disappoint.\nWhile this LP isn't unlikely to change any of\nthat, it is anything but disappointing. Sure\nenough, great pop tunes check in with\nmonotonous regularity but behind the catchy\nhooks lurks something darker. Guitars refuse to\nchime, jangle or crunch, but instead seem to cast\na thundercloud over the proceedings: the vocals\nis relentlessly deep and seductive and the\nmelodies have a frustrating familiarity which\nnever quite makes itself obvious. This is not\ngoing to set anybody's world alight but if guitar-pop is your cup of tea and you fancy something\nwith a little more bite, you could do much worse\nthan this. (7) Guy\n...you don't need a lover, you need a sparring partner...\n\n"

    "content": "News 3\nNo Confidence In ICU President Reach For\nThe Skies\nICU President Andrew Wensley\nBY THE NEWS TEAM The future of Andrew Wensley as\nImperial College Union (ICU)\nPresident is uncertain following a motion of censure submitted for\ntoday's Annual General Meeting\n(AGM).\nThe motion, submitted by Rhian\nPicton, Royal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU) President, details a number of his past inadequacies.\nThe allegations include: deliberate\nmisleading of a Union General\nMeeting (UGM); negligence in the\nexecution of his duties in not bringing a satisfactory constitution to\nUGM for apr oval; in a bil ty to perform his duties to a satisfactory\nstandard.\nA letter leaked to Felix has indicated the reasons for the submission\nof the motion. The letter, from\nCollege Registrar Peter Mee to Mr\nWensley, recommends that the\nwhole process of setting the new\nconst it ui on restarts at the \"begin-ning of the next session\". Mr Mee\nhighlights in his letter the fact that\nthe constitution has not yet been\npassed by even one U GM and\npresumes \"that the possibility of\ngetting it through two UGMs before\nI need the papers to go out to the\nGoverning Body on 24 June no\nlonger exists.\"\nThe motion itself was submitted\nafter the deadline for motions (10th June). This means that the decision\nto present the motion to the AGM is\nSummer\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nThe cancellation of the Imperial\nCollege Summer Ball has cost over\n\u00a31,000.\nThe ambitious event, organised\nby the City & Guilds College Union\n(C& GCU) aimed to attract up to\n1,000 students to Silwood Park this\nweekend. Paul Griffith, C& GCU\nPresident, told Felix: \"There's a lot\nof disappointment on everyone's part. \"\nThe main source of problems\nwas the sheer size of the event. A project of this magnitude had never\nbeen attempted by C& CGU before\nand it is thought that the current\nExecutive Committee had problems\nsecuring sufficient funding in time.\nThe decision to cancel the event\nwas made on Friday 3rd June, the\nat the discretion of the UGM Chair.\nFollowing discussions with Mr\nWensley, the UGM Chair Paul\nThomas decided to reject the\nmotion. It is now thought that the\nmatter will be brought up under\nAny Other Business.\nDetailing her reasons for submitting the proposal, Rhian Picton told\nFelix: \"Something needs to go on\nrecord.\" She also slammed the pre s ident, saying: \"There is some serious misrepresentation going on.\"\nMiss Picton was worried that ICU\nwas \"operating under an ille a gal const it ion\" as it has not yet been\npassed at two UGMs. She also\nstated: \"it is my duty to inform my\nCancelled:\nsame day as the Ball was first\nadvertised in Felix. Some posters\nadvertising the ball have not yet\nbeen taken down.\nThe lateness of advertising the\nevent is one of the criticisms being\nfired at the C& GCU. Despite this\nMr Griffith assured that the cancellation of the Ball was not due to\npoor ticket sales: \"Someone came\ninto the office today [Wednesday,\ndue to be the last day of ticket sales]\nasking if they could have 20\ntickets.\"\nThe Ball was to be a joint venture between C& GCU and the Halls\nof Residence and it had originally\nbeen hoped that the Halls would\ncontribute money 'up front' which\nwould have been used to pay off\ndeposits on some of the events.\nSome Halls were however not\nstudents what is going on.\"\nAlthough Miss Picton has the\nsupport of the four Constituent\nCollege Unions she emphasised that\nthese were her own views and not\nthose of RCSU.\nIn his defence, Mr Wensley told\nFelix: \"Although the President is\nresponsible...there has to be the\npolitical will\" to get anything done.\nWhen asked if he would resign following this motion he abruptly\nreplied \"no\". He also said that he\nfelt that the motion was \"a petty\nway \" of dealing with the matter.\nToday's AGM will be held at\nl pm in the Union Lounge.\nOfficial!\nprepared to take the risk of losing\nsuch a large amount of money.\nAccording to Mr Griffith, C& CGU\nstill have the \"goodwill of Silwood\nand the contractors\", and it is hoped\nthat the event will go ahead next\nyear, now that a lot of the preliminary organisation has already been\ncarried out.\nDismissing claims that C& GCU\nhad been too ambitious Paul\nGriffith told Felix: \"Unless you\nhave something unique you aren't going to sell the event. Imperial\nneeds this event and we're going to\ngo ahead and do it.\"\nIf the Ball goes ahead next year\nC& GCU will be approaching\ncompanies about the possibility of\nsponsorship. The decision to run the\nBall lies with next year'sC& GCU\nExecutive Committee.\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nMarcus Krackowizer, a tetra ple gic Aeronautics student at Imperial\nCollege, has won a Flying\nScholarship for Disabled People\nfrom the International Air Tattoo\n(IAT). The scholarship gives Mr\nKrackowizer the chance to spend\nsix weeks learning to fly this summer in Atlanta, America.\nIAT was set up in 1983 to honour disabled World War II flying\nace Sir Douglas Bader. 95 disabled\npeople have so far learnt to fly with\nof the scheme.\nMr Krackowizer, who earlier\nthis year completed the London\nMarathon in his wheelchair, will be\npresented with his Scholarship by\nKing Hussein of Jordan, one of the\nscheme's sponsors, later this\nmonth.\nCensored\nTomorrow's issue of Cub, the\nnewspaper of Queen Mary and\nWestfield College Union (QMWU)\nwill contain censored articles.\nThe staff of Cub had finished\npreparing the current issue early\nthis week, due to come out today.\nThey then delivered the disk files to\nthe printers, based in South\nLondon. Just over two hours later,\nthe President of QMWU, Fayaz\nSaeed, is said to have arrived at the\nprinters with a disk containing\nnumerous changes to the issue. He\nallegedly demanded access to the\noriginal files, to make changes\nincluding blanking out two news\narticles (one of which concerned\nhis handling of the QMWU constitution), removal of an opinion article on his performance as president\nand removal of three letters from\nstudents. Any action of this type\nwould be illegal under the constitution of QMWU.\nAnother news story that is said\nto have been blanked out concerned\nprevious trouble during the issue's production. The issue's files had\nbeen deliberately erased by an\nunknown party when it was three\nquarters of the way to completion.\nTwo days later, the templates on\nwhich issues are based were also\nerased.\nThe deadline for articles for the last issue is 5pm on Friday\n\n"

    "content": "a Feature\nScientific\nInstruments\nPatrick Wood selects highlights from\n45 years of music at IC and talks to\nMusician in Residence Richard\nDickins about the latest developments.\nIt was in 1949 that post-war musical activity\nbegan in earnest at Imperial College. That was\nthe year that David Tombs, a senior lecturer\nfrom the Electrical Engineering Department,\ninaugurated the lunchtime concert series which\nis still in existence today.\nThe following year, Mr Tombs founded\nImperial College Choir. For their third concert,\non 5th December 1950, the Choir were joined by\nthe newly-formed, 25-strong Imperial College\nOrchestra for a performance of Handel's Acis\nand Galatea, with soloists from the Royal\nCollege of Music. The concert also included\nitems for voice and piano: \"The accompanist\nwas Eric Brown,\" reported Felix the following\nweek, \"who cannot be too highly praised.\" A few years later, Professor Brown was to become\ndirector of the Choir and has been the guiding\nlight for choral music at IC ever since. After a performance of the Verdi Requiem in the Great\nHall last term, Felix reported that \"Professor\nBrown remains a choir-trainer of the highest\norder\".\nFor four concerts during the mid-fifties, IC\nChoir was under the directorship of Imogen\nHoist, daughter of Gustav and musical assistant\nto Benjamin Britten from 1952. For her first\nconcert in December 1955, the Choir gave the\nLondon premiere of Britten's Hymn to St Peter,\na six-minute anthem with organ accompaniment\nre scored in this case, with the composer's permission, for strings and piano. A Times critic\nwas present and wrote that the work \"contains\nthe sort of felicities one would expect, although\nthe choir did not appear to find it very easy\".\nSome now illustrious singers made\nappearances early on in their careers as soloists\nwith the Choir. \"The choice of soloists has\nalways been a game of spotting the winners,\"\nsays Professor Brown. \"Appropriately for a student society, our soloists have almost always\nbeen chosen from the ranks of young\nprofessionals with their way and name still to\nmake. A good number of our hunches have\nproved to be winners of real calibre.\" Gwyneth\nJones, John Shirley-Quirk, Roger Norrington,\nPhilip Langridge, Thomas Allen, Anthony Rolfe\nJohnson, John Tomlinson, David WilsonJohnson, Anne-Marie Owens and James Galway\n(playing the flute part in the Pastorale by Bliss\nin 1959) have all appeared with IC Choir. And in\nMarch 1958, one of the soloists in Bach'sB Minor Mass was a young mezzo named\nJanet Baker. (It would\nhave been satisfying to\nreport that a Felix\ncolumnist had singled\nher out as a talent to\nwatch. Alternatively, it\nwould have made a better story had someone written something\nlike: \"A Miss Janet\nBaker seemed to this\ncritic to be completely\ndevoid of almost all the\nnecessary musical\nattributes. Don't give\nup the day job, love.\"\nBut alas there is no\nmention of the event.)\nThere have also\nbeen more than a few\nadventurous choices of\nrepertoire. Looking through the list of the\nChoir's performances, painstakingly compiled\nby the current secretary, James White, one finds\namong the Mozart C Minor Masses, Haydn\nCreations and Faure Requiems, works such as\nBizet's Te Deum, Puccini's Messa di Gloria,\nVaughan Williams' Sea Symphony, Choral\nDances from Britten's Gloriana, Verdi's Stabat\nMater, Honegger's Cantate de Noel and, in\nMarch 1968, the London premiere of Mahler's early cantata Das Klagende Lied, in the comp-os er's revised version without the opening section.\nInstrumental music has been well served by\nthe lunchtime concert series. Highlights include\npiano recitals by Julius Katchen and Denis\nMatthews, appearances by flautist William\nBennett, clarinettist Thea King, trumpeter\nCrispian Steele-Perkins and, in 1951, a guitar\nrecital by Julian Bream. Orchestral concerts\nwere much more sporadic, due to fluctuations in\nthe number of players, until the appointment of\nICSO's present conductor, Richard Dickins, in\n1979. Beginning as he meant to go on, in his\nfirst concert Dickins ambitiously conducted\nwhat was then a rare performance of Barber's demanding Cello Concerto. The soloist was\nRaphael Wallfisch, whose father, the late concert\npianist Peter Wallfisch, had taken part in a recital at IC back in 1968.\nRichard Dickins rehearses the Imperial College Chamber Orchestra before\ntheir concert in the Grosvenor Chapel in Mayfair last week.\nFrom just 35 players in 1979, ICSO has\ngrown into a body of almost 100 musicians\ncapable of playing works as complex and\ndifficult as the Fifth Symphony by Mahler,\nwhich they performed so successfully last term.\nDickins is unequivocal about the rewards of\nconducting ICSO: \"The big excitement is\nworking with people of such intellectual ability.\nWe've done enormously demanding pieces, The\nRite of Spring, this enormous Mahler Five we've\njust done - we've done all the previous ones as\nwell - pieces which are enormously taxing. But\npeople are so keen, so enthusiastic and\nintellectually able to get round the demands.\"\nDickins' association with ICSO led to his\nappointment as Imperial College's musician in\nresidence six years ago. Since then he has been\ninvolved in setting up the Eric Ash music\nscholarships, named after IC's previous rector,\nwho was closely involved in securing their\nfunding. These awards give musicians at\nImperial College the opportunity to study with\nprofessors at the Royal College of Music. \"We\nfind this is an enormous incentive to people\nthinking of coming to South Kensington,\" says\nDickins. \"It's done wonders for the standard of\nplaying in the orchestra.\"\nFurther links between Imperial College and\nthe RCM have since been established in the form\nThe Underwater Club Easter Tour is reported on page 10\n\n"
