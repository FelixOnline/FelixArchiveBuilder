    "content": "LETTERS\nDear Colin\nI would like to make public my\ngrievances regarding the conduct\nof some of the staff behind Stan's Bar, Southside. Apart from being\nunhelpful, unfriendly and arrogant,\nthings of which many people are\naware, they are also offensive and\nfoul-tongued. This I found to my\ncost on Saturday night last when I asked for some change for the\nvideogame in Stan's Bar. The immediate reaction from one of the\nbarmen was: \" Fk off, this isn'taf king bank\".\nThis was not an isolated incident.\nWhen another customer asked for\na packet of peanuts he received an\nequally witty reply. (\"Piss off, this\nisn't afk in e sweet-shop.\")\nOther people were given typically\ngruff and unpleasant seri ve. Surprisingly, when a customer\nwho had been waiting for about\nfive minutes for service, muttered\n\" St\" under his breath, he was told\nto mind his language by the other\nbarman.\nIs it necessary to employ such\nunpleasant people as bar-staff? Just\nbecause we are students I do not\nunderstand why we should be\ntreated quite so deplorably.\nI am looking forward to a reply\nfrom whoever is responsible for\nemploying the bar-staff at Stan's. Yours etc,\nNick Taube\nPhysics One\nDear Colin\n' How nice to be in England, now that summer's here!' With all\nthe warm weather hitting London\nlately, may I comment to your columns how good I feel. Isn't it\nlovely to walk across the Union\nQuad and feel the soft springy\nstone bet wen one's toes. The way\nthe calm luxuriant flagstones reflect\ntheir heat is pure ec stacy. Oh boy!\nAmI glad that our predecessors saw\nfit to pave over all that hard unyielding green grass! What forethought! Rue the day when we\nhave to revert to nature.\nSean O 'Boyle\nEDITORIAL\nExam Answers\n1. Since all three applicants raised their\nhands, there are two possibilities: two\nblack and a white or three black. If\ntherefore, there were a white mark on any\nforehead, two students would see one\nblack and one white and would instantly\ndeduce that the third mark must be black.\nSince this instant solution did not\noccur, each of the three students saw two\nblack marks. Therefore all were black,\nincluding the mark of the successful\napplicant.\n2. O.K. so you came up with an easy\nsolution - there are several. Pour four of\nthe half-full barrels together to make two\nmore full ones. Now there are nine full\nbarrels, three' half-full barrels, and nine\nempty barrels. All can be divided by three.\n3. The landlady has a nine year old\ndaughter and two-year-old twins.\n4. One of the terms is (xx) therefore the\nanswer is zero.\n5. Pick a garment out of the \" Rag sweatshirts and Horrids T shirt box\". You then know which label should be fixed to\nthat box. As all the labels were initially\nincorrect then the other two labels can be\nsimply exchanged.\n6. The reporter should ask either man, \"If I were to ask you if this is the way I should\ngo, would you say yes?\"\n7. \"Switch bikes\"\n8. A is 2, B is 1, C is 9, D is 7, E is 8.\n9. He added his own camel making the\ndivision easy. 18/2 is 9, 18/3 is 6,18/9 is 2.\nSince the total is 17, the wise man was then\nable to take back his own camel and ride\non.\n10. House numbers.\nBarclays\nAt the moment there is no Union policy\ncovering the placing of Barclays adverts in\nUnion publications. However, I have\nprinted an article from the Anti-Apartheid\nGroup at IC on page 9. Let's have some\nletters on this and other subjects for next\nweek's FELIX. Review\nWith a bit of luck, if you're still around\nnext week you ll be able to pick up a FELIX containing a review of the year....\nThis week I have included a complete\ndo-it-yourself exam package complete\nwith certificate. I let you judge which grade\nyou should be awarded. At least you'll\nleave Imperial with one paper qualification!\nThanks\nTo Tim, Maz and Ian also to the\nhardworking Marie-Therese Weech who\nseems to be able to contentedly fall asleep\nin the FELIX office during the day! Even\nwhen we're panicking to beat deadlines\nand trying to induce people to write\narticles.\nColin Palmer\nFELIX Editor\nA WARNING\nThe current, disgracefully irresponsible behaviour of residents in Southside is likely to\nlead to a serious breakdown of relations with\nMews residents.\nThe hurling of objects out of Hall windows is\nboth dangerous and annoying, and if these\nobjects are bottles then the action becomes\npotentially homicidal.\nWhether or not the current spate of bottles\nemerges from Southside, the Halls only draw\nsuspicion on themselves by the continued shower\nof weighted paper darts, carrier bags filled with\nwater, cans, etc, on the mews side of the Halls.\nI view the allegations of bottle throwing even\nmore seriously and any students or guests of\nstudent residents can expect no help from me if they were to be asked to leave College, and indeed, I would support the College line on this\nissue.\nIf this practice, and that of abusing persons in\nthe Mews, continues, a private detective is going\nto be hired with the aim of amassing evidence\nand prosecuting individuals. It is therefore very\nimportant that those responsible persons who\nlive in Halls clamp down on the lunatic fringe\nand prevent this happening.\nCHRIS FOX\nPresident\nIC Photoshop\nEND OF YEAR SALE\nTUESDAY 10th JUNE\n12:30 - 1:30\nOLD DARKROOM\nBeit Quad\nColour Film\nKodacolour II\nKodacolour 400\nKodacolour II\nKodacolour II\nKodacolour 400\nKodacolour 400\nEktachrome 200\nEktachrome 200\nKodachrome 25\nKodachrome 64\nC11020(100 ASA Instamatic)\nCG-UO-20 (400 ASA Instamatic)\nC13524C13536 CG-135-24\nCG-135-36\nED-135-36\nEL-135-36\nKM-135-36\nKR-135-36\n(200 ASA Slide)\n(400 ASA Slide)\n(Process Paid)\n(Process Paid)\n\u00a3L20\n\u00a31.35\n\u00a31.30\n\u00a31-70\n\u00a31.60\n\u00a32.10\n\u00a32.90\n\u00a33.40\n\u00a33.90\n\u00a33.90\nFELIX ie published by the Editor, on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board.

    "content": "ACCOMMODATION FOR NEXT YEAR As the examinations draw to an end, thoughts\ninevitably turn to next session and the thorny\nproblem of finding accommodation.\nIdeally, it would be nice to get fixed up with\nsomething this term so that you don't have to\nworry about it over the vacation. Unfortunately\nthis is not a very easy thing to achieve as most\nlandlords are not interested in giving firm\npromises for the future which leaves the rather\nunattractive alternative of finding a place now\nand paying for U over the summer.\nIf you do want to book something now for\nnext term without having to pay for it over the\nsummer, the best place to inquire is the UL Accommodation Office at 8 Princes Gardens.\nThe Welfare Centre has a few beds its available which can be booked in advance and\nwe are hoping to get some more in the near\nfuture.\nAgencies, newspapers and notice b bards are\nnot much use for this purpose as they tend to\ndeal with current vacancies rather than future\nones.\nIf you don't manage to find anything this\nterm, then it is probably best to forget all\nabout it until September when it is financially\nviable to take on a current vacancy even if you\ndon't actually need it until the beginning of\nterm.\nThe accommodation market is highly com petit ve at that time of the year since there\nis an enormous influx of students. This means\nthat the earlier you start looking in September,\nthe better.\nMost people would probably prefer to live in\na flat than in a beds it and one of the snags that\nflat hunters tend to come across in September\nis that landlords are. reluctant to let a flat\nunless they can interview all the prospective\nshare rs before granting a tenancy. Since it is\nquite frequent for one or more members, of a group looking for a flat, to be away on holiday\nor on a field trip at this time of year, difficulty\ncan arise and so it is a point worth bearing in\nmind when you are planning your strategy for\nfinding a flat.\nIf you are going to find it difficult to come\ndown to London early on in September to start\nlooking, you can always ring the Welfare\nCentre for addresses and then try and fix an\nappointment with the landlady for a time when\nit is convenient to see the place.\nWhen you do start looking at places, one of\nthe problems that arises is if you are offered a place which does not come up to your expectations and you have to decide whether\nor not to take it or risk ending up in something\nworse.\nIf you don't have any experience of living in\nthe private rented sector, it might be an idea to\ntry and look at some places this term, eg those\noccupied by friends or you could even have a look at places that arc being offered by the\nvarious accommodation sources at present.\nThis will give you an idea of the standards and\nprices to expect \u2014 bearing in mind that there\nis likely to be some increase in prices by the\nbeginning of the next term.\nIf you are thinking of coming to look for\naccommodation in September, there should be\nsome temporary ac com mod at in available in the\nHalls and then in the Union Crash Pad. Details\nof these schemes are not yet available, but\nsoon should be, so keep an eye on FELIX or\ncheck with the Union Office before coming\ndown to look.\nIn September, possible sources of accommodation will be:\nUniversity of London Accommodation\nCentre (8 Princes Gardens)\nThis office is mainly concerned with finding\naccommodation for fresher s during this period\nand so they won't have much to offer non-fresher s. The best time to use them is now\nwhen they will have details of places that you\ncan book in advance.\nWelfare Centre (3rd floor, Union Building)\nFlat Agencies\nThese usually charge one to two weeks rent\nfor finding you a place. They also tend to deal\nwith the more expensive accommodation. A list of agencies which have been recommended\nby various people can be obtained from the\nWelfare Centre.\nNewspapers\nThese do provide a source of accommodation\nbut the evening papers are very widely read\nand people queue in Fleet Street to get the\nfirst edition. As a result places advertised go\nvery quickly and so, although worth trying, this\napproach is often more frustrating than\nproductive. Local papers \u2014 eg, the Kensington\nand Chelsea Post are read by fewer people,\nbut contain correspondingly fewer accommodation advertisements.\nNoticeboards\nA lot of sweet shops, etc, have noticeboards\nwith accommodation vacancies. They tend to\nbe past history by the time you get to look at\nthem but some have dates scribbled on them\nwhich you can use to select the most recent\nAll in all, accommodation hunting can be\npretty hard work but per server ance is usually\nrewarded. If you find yourself in a position\nwhere you have to take something which\ndoesn't suit you, don't despair. As long as the\narrangement with the landlord doesn't tie you\nto staying on there for a long time, you can sit\nit out until the rush dies down and then start\nlooking again.\nIf you have any worries about finding\naccommodation, you can always come up to\nthe Welfare Centre for a chat about it.\nVACATION MONEY\nIf you can't get a job during the vacation\n(incidentally the Welfare Centre has a list of\nvacation jobs) it is worth remembering that you\ncan claim supplementary benefit, which starts\nat \u00a316.35 per week if you are living at home\nand goes up if you are paying rent. You can\nalso claim unemployment benefit if you have\nsufficient National Insurance contrib u ions and\nthe new contribution conditions that have been\nimposed on students do not apply during the\nsummer.\nLUGGAGE STORE\nFor those of you who are going to find it\ndifficult to take all your stuff away with you at\nthe end of the term, there will be a luggage\nstore in the Union Building. For further details\ncontact the Welfare Centre.\nMichael Arthur\nDon't Bank with\nApartheid\nsays the Anti Apartheid Group at IC following last\nweek's Barclays advert\nThe views expressed in this article are not\nnecessarily those of FELIX or the Editor of FELIX\n- Editorial comment page 10\nBarclays And South Africa\nBarclays has traditionally been attacked for its\nsupport for South Africa on government projects.\nThe latest major such venture is its\ninvestment in Sasol the South African State Oil\nCorporation, in which Barclays National has a \u00a310million holding.\nThe South African government has frantically\nbeen investing in oil from coal production in\norder to cushion itself against any future oil\nembargo. Barclays not only assisted in\nproviding the financing of this project but also\nhandled the selling of shares in Sasol on the\nJohannesburg stock exchange.\nThe call for an oil embargo is an essential\nstep in bringing down the apartheid regime. It\nshould also be remembered that fuel is vital for.\nthe South African 'defence' forces continually\nused to repress any opposition movement\nagainst apartheid. Barclays should be exposed\nfor fuelling apartheid.\nBarclays Bank Ltd has a60% share of its\nsubsidiary Barclays National in South Africa. It\nis therefore capable of stopping this support\nfor the regime ..in South Africa.\nThe other argument against Barclays is that\nit is the biggest bank in South Africa.\nAlthough it claims a progressive image and\ndoubtless could substantiate its claim to abide\nby the EEC' s Code of Conduct its actual\nemployment statistics expose clearly the lie\nthat it can in any way be challenging the\napartheid system.\nIn South Africa there are employed 2,480\nnon-white clerical staff as against 13,000 whites.\nHardly an example of equality of opportunity in\na country with exactly reversed population\nproportions!\nSir Anthony Tuke, Chairman of Barclays, at\ntheir recent AGM justified little being done to\nchallenge apartheid by saying that the bank\nhad to work within the law. That also means\nthat the bank is subject to racist employment\nlaws and one can only doubt whether the bank\nseriously concerns itself with this problem\nwhen as it readily admits its chief concern is-to\nprotect its investments and profit margins, not\nto worry about 'political issues'. Apartheid yields big profits by racist exploitation and\nrepression of the majority of the population. In\nsuch a situation passive acceptance of 'the law'\nis no different from active support for\napartheid.\nWhy Pick On Barclays In Particular? *\n1. It is one of three British based banks involved in the Sasol financing (the others are\nStandard Chartered and Hill Samuel) and of\nthose is the largest shareholder.\n2. Barclays National, the South African subsidiary, is the largest bank in South Africa\nand therefore operates under racist employment\npolicies and in many ways acts to prop up the\napartheid system.\nWhat Can You Do?\n1. Don't bank with Barclays.\n2. Write a letter to the Union Exec/Council\ncalling for no more adverts to be placed by\nBarclays in Union publications.\n3. Support IC Anti Apartheid Group.( Co ordination Kevin Courtney, Physics 3).\nAnti-Apartheid Group\n9\n\n"

    "content": "OUT IN THE COLD! Phi! Thurman\nPhil Thurman\nRESIDENTS SAFE\nAFTER BEIT FIRE\nAt 4:10am, last Saturday morning, Beit residents and their guests were\nwoken by a fire alarm. This time it was for real \u2014 flames leapt from Beit\nroof.\n\u00a35000 worth of damage as extractor plant is destroyed by an\nelectrical fault.\nTwo police officers, who were on\nEmbassy patrol, spotted smoke\nrising from the roof. The police\nwent into the Beit messengers office and spoke to the security\nofficer, Mr Wilson. The group climbed up to the Botany roof.\nThey saw flames coming from a shed and the police immediately\nradioed for the fire brigade.\nMr Wilson went back to set off\nthe alarm and to evacuate both\nhostels. He went to each floor and\nleft the residents to spread the\nword. One or two students banged\non the doors of the 'heavy' sleepers\nand the hall was completely evacuated in a few minutes.\nThe fire brigade came five\nminutes after the radio call. Fireman\nwith breathing apparatus checked\nthe South wing of Botany while\nothers used CO2 to put out the fire\non the roof.\nBeit residents, some wearing\ntheir night clothes, sheltered from\nthe rain by standing in the entrance\nto Chem Eng. After about forty\nminutes they were able to return to\ntheir rooms.\nLoans to replace grants\nConcern is being caused by the investigation of the Commons Select\nCommittee on Education into the possibility of introducing a system of\nloans to students to replace the present grant system.\nThe possibility of introducing\nsuch a system has been discussed\nat intervals ever since the present\ngovernment came to power. It is\nknown to be favoured by a number\nof senior ministers including Sir\nKeith Joseph.\nThe Committee last week took\nevidence from the secretary of the\nCommittee of London Clearing Banks, who offered the opinion\nthat the major banks would be\ninterested in any scheme that\noffered \" a reasonably commercial\nrate of interest\", provided that\nrepayment was made over a reasonable period of time, and that\ncertain safeguards were given.\nMost of the evidence given to\nthe committee so far no in ts to the\nintroduction of a mixed system of\ngrants supplemented by loans. This\nis the system used by most of the\nEuropean and American countries\nwho use loan schemes.\nAccording to evidence from\nProfessor Cedric Sandford, who\nhas for some time campaigned for\na loan system, a third of students\nat Bath and Exeter expressed a preference for loans in preference\nto grants.\nThe National Union of Students\nhas already raised the question\nwith the Department of Education\nand has made clear its objections.\nThe NUS is expected to submit\nevidence to the Committee in the\nnext few weeks arguing against the\nconcept of student loans.\nVice-President Elect for Education,\nAndy Pearman, explained: \"Loans\ndon't do anything to extend access\nto education, in fact they restrict it.\nThose who benefit most from grants\nare those from working class backgrounds; they would be deterred\nfrom entering higher education by\nthe fact that they might not be able\nto repay the loans taken out.\"\nRed Cross Week\nMay 4th \u2014 10th Thanks to all in College who\nhelped by collecting or donating\nduring this week. A total of\n\u00a34,450 was raised by Kensington\nand Chelsea Centre, which\nincludes the College Detachment\nand Members Group, for London\nBranch funds. This is an increase\non previous years' totals.\nICWA\nThe elections for next year'sIC WA Committee were held on Tuesday\n13th May and resulted in the\nfollowing people being elected:\nPresident - Sandra O' Sullivan( Physics 2)\nHon Sec - Sheila Cox( Geology 1)\nDeputy President - Jill Hanson( Met and Mat Sci 2)\nEnts Officers - Jenny Egdall (Civ\nEng 1) and Eleanor Linton (Life Sci 1)\nPublicity Officer -' Ann Edmunds\n\" - (Life Sci 1)\nCity and Guilds Rep - Anna Binton\n( CCD1) Unfortunately Sandra, as seen in\nFELIX, has stated that she is not\nprepared to actually do anything\nfor I CW A. The rest of the committee\nis very keen however, and together\nwe have decided to hold a meeting\non Tuesday 17th June at 12:00 in\nthe I CW A Lounge to discuss the\nPresident Elect's proposals for\nI CW A and plans that the incoming\ncommittee as a whole have for\nnext session. Your ideas will be\nmost welcome. Good Luck with\nany exams.\nM Clark and the ICWA Committee\n(1979-80 and 1980-81).\nLondon Student\nThe future of the newspaper London Student is under threat as a result\nof financial pressures on its publishers, the University of London Union.\nEach copy of the paper costs\nabout 7.5p to produce. Advertising\nrevenue is not large enough to\ncover staff, printing and running\ncosts.\nUnless College unions enter a subscription scheme currently being launched for next year, it is\nunlikely that UL U will be able to\ncontinue to finance the deficit and\nthe paper will fold.\nThe scheme asks colleges to pay\n2.5 per copy and distribute the\npaper free to members.2,000 copies have already been ordered,\nand several college unions have\nalso given verbal commitments to\njoin- the scheme. However, completed order forms are needed before the end of this term if the\npaper's future is to be secured.\nLondon Student is the only London-wide paper written and run\nby students. Twenty thousand copies are distributed each week in\nterm time to colleges, polytechnics\nand further and higher education\ncolleges, many of which are isolated\non the fringes of greater London.\nDeborah Perkin, Vice President\n( Services) at UL U, said in a document sent to college unions\nthat if London Student ceased to\nexist it would be \" a sad day for\nLondon students, and a tragedy for\nLondon student unions\".\n3\n\n"

    "content": "SPYING Several junior trainee officers, hoping to\nbecome successful agents of the CIA, listen to their lecturer outlining the basics\nof intelligence gathering. \" You can learn\nmore about a country's military potential\nby a careful study of the many specialised\njournals devoted to defense subjects than\na clandestine agent could discover in\nyears.\"\nReading more than20,000 pieces of\nliterature every month, is one of the tasks\nof the CIA at their headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Most intelligence comes from\" alternative means\" rather than spying. Soviet intelligence officers are avid\nreaders of Western publications of all\nkinds. About eighty percent of most countries' intelligence requirements can\nbe met from such white (open or overt)\nsources. A great deal can be learned from\nreading and assessing newspapers.\nThe remaining twenty percent of\nintelligence material can be learned only\nby black (undercover or covert) methods,\nand this almost invariably means by espionage. This material falls into four\nmain categories: plans, processes, politics\nand pieces.\nPlans include not only the drawing board type of plans that were once the \u2022\nnumber one item on the shopping list, but\nalso plans in the sense of \"intentions\".\nProcesses include much of the material\ncurrently given a high priority, such as\ntechnological developments and industrial\nsecrets.\nPolitics covers all internal and external\npolitical activity, from the jockeying for\npower and position within a government\nto that government's relations with other\ncountries.\nPieces is a term derived from an analogy with jigsaw puzzles. In a jigsaw\npuzzle it may be impossible to see the\nwhole picture if some pieces are missing,\nso pieces are any items of information still\nneeded to assess or understand other information already in hand.\nOne of the three main routes into espionage work is from a university. In\nthe United States the intelligence agencies\nhave their friends on the campus, often\nkey professors who have connections with the secret world. As in the USA, the\nBritish universities, in particular Oxford and Cambridge, provide many recruits to\nthe British SIS.\nThe screening process for the CIA is\ntough and it is an exceptional year when\nmore than100 college graduates are\nrecruited into the agency. It has been\nestimated that out of 1,000 potential recruits all from the top quarter of their\nclasses, about800 are screened out i mediate ly because of an unfavourable background or some lack in their educational standards. The remaining 200,\nwho go through s ecu iri ty checks and personality assessment, are eventually\nreduced to about 90. Of the 110 who are\neliminated at this stage, about70 are\nfailed because of personal defects, such\nas drinking, talking too much, or homos ex u ali ty, and about40 dropped from consideration for serious security reasons.\nIf you've read today's National papers you H have heard of\nAndrew Boyle and his\nbook that unmasked\nAnthony Blunt. How do students become\nspies? This article gives a brief outline.\nPhoto: A small tape\nrecorder that fits into\na cigarette packet.\nJust one of the tools of\na spy.\nOf the 90 who will be offered employment,\nprobably about 10 will finally decide not\nto take up the offer. The remaining 80 will\nbe enrolled in the junior officer training\nprogram.\nAlthough intelligence work is supposed\nto be exciting, the British recruit will find\nthat after initial training that although the\nwork sounds exciting, in fact a great deal\nof it is tedious, boring and bureau r crat ic. Harry Gold, the American Communist who as a go-between for Klaus Fuchs,\ntold his FBI interrogators when he was\ncaught:\" There is difficulty in raising money for trips. The weary hours of\nwaiting on street corners in strange towns where I had no business to be. The\nkilling of time in cheap movies and the\nlies I had to tell at home and to my friends to explain my supposed where-about s.

    "content": "MUHAMMAD IN THE BIBLE?\nAs Christians we feel that we must make a public reply to\nthe pamphlet entitled \"Muhammad In The Bible\" that has\nbeen circulated in IC over the past few months. While not\nwanting to enter into a technical textual and Historical\ndebate just for the sake of it, nonetheless, it is very\nimportant to examine the question of whether the New\nTestament text is reliable. This article briefly does this and\nalso examines the in con csis ten cie s that appear to exist in\nthe author's method of argument. By way of reminder the\nmessage presented by the author of the pamphlet is that the\n\"Spirit of truth\" (or \"Comforter\") which Jesus talks about in\nJohn chapters 14 and 16 does not refer to the unseen Holy\nSpirit of God but the man Muhammad.\nIn making our reply may we begin by\nconsidering two statements made by the author.\nThe first refers to the author of John's Gospel\n(the fourth book in the New Testament) as\n\" John \u2014 an unknown writer in the second\ncentury of the Christian era\". The second states\nthat \"some hasty editor was not satisfied with\nthe expression \" Spirit of truth\", or did not\nunderstand it, and assumed that this must be\nthe same as the Holy Spirit . . . Such words are\nfound nowhere else and are obviously an\naddition to the text.\" These and other hypothetical arguments (we use the term\nhypothetical in the strict sense of the word) are\nused to question the accuracy of the record of\nJesus' words, from which point the author goes\non to suggest what Jesus really said. So he\nappears to rely on the reader of his article\nunquestioningly accepting the commonly held,\nbut incorrect, view that the New Testament\ndocuments have been proved unreliable. Many\nbelieve that they were written a couple of\ncenturies after the time of Christ and have been\ntranslated and copied out so many times since\nthen that vast numbers of words and sentences\nmust have altered, been missed out or even\nadded. But when facts are faced such views do\nnot stand up. Let's for example examine the\nGospel of John which is certainly not the earliest\npiece of Christian writing in the New Testament\n(see reference 1).\nThe earliest fragment of the Gospel now in\nexistence is dated at about AD125 and it is\ngenerally accepted that the Gospel itself was\nwritten between AD70\u201490 ie 40\u201460 years after\nthe crucifixion of Jesus. There is also strong\ntextual and traditional evidence that the author\nwas John the disciple of Jesus, not an unknown\nwriter and certainly not a second century writer.\nThe other three Gospels are also eyewitness\naccounts of the life of Christ. As one would\nexpect the quantity of New Testament manuscripts increases as we move into the\nsecond, third and fourth centuries AD. By this\ntime we have literally hundreds of copies in a dozen languages: the 5th century codex\nAlexandr in us and the 4th century codex\nSiniaticus (complete New Testament texts) both\nreside in London in the British Museum with\nmany other and earlier New Testament manuscripts.\nAlso in existence is a complete set of the Four\nGospels each in papyrus book form and dated\nbefore AD200. Admittedly, there are variations\nbetween manuscripts, about 157 in the four New\nTestament Gospels. The vast majority are very\nminor and of the kind seen in Matthew chapter\n3 verse 11 and Luke chapter 3 verse 16 where\nJohn the Baptist is said to have baptised \"with\nwater\" while some manuscripts read \" in water\".\nWhat should be recognised is that not a single\npoint of Christian belief hangs on a disputed\nreading.\nThe sort of time scales mentioned above may\nstill seem rather long, but Christian manuscript\ntradition is in fact much stronger for the New\nTestament Gospels than for any other ancient\nbook. The text of Caesar's book \"Gallic Wars\"\nfor example is based on a single ninth century\nmanuscript, ie a900 year gap separates the\noriginal work from the earliest copy now\navailable. One final point to mention here,\nbefore leaving the matter of New Testament\nreliability, is the way archaeology has shed a great deal of light on the Gospels and the book\nof the Acts of the Apostles. Again and again\narchaeology has vindicated their reliability.\nLet's go back to John's Gospel for an example.\nIn chapter 19 verse 13 we are told that Jesus\nwas tried before Pilate at a place called The\nPavement (Gabbatha in Hebrew). Nobody knew\nanything about such a pavement and it looked\nlike John was adding dramatic atmosphere to\nthe simple tale of Christ's trial until French\narchaeologist Pere Vincent dug it up in the\n1930s. It measured fifty yards square and can be\nseen in the city today. For a much deeper study\nof the reliability of the New Testament see\nreferences 1, 2 and 3.\nHaving very briefly outlined the fact that the\nGospels are early and reliable (something that\neven critical scholars now accept in the light of\nso much evidence) we now turn to examine the\nauthor's method of argument a little closer. On reading the pamphlet carefully it becomes clear\nthat his arguments are based on assumed\nerrors in the text for which he admits himself\nthere is no positive textual evidence available\n(paragraph 4 sentence 6). However, for a moment let us assume that the New Testament\nis unreliable and see what the implications are.\nUsing a scientific analogy the author is saving\nthat he has got a bad set of data but he can\ncorrect it (without having external evidence to\ngive his corrections any degree of authority),\nand the corrected data fits in with his theory\nand so proves it to be true. But the New\nTestament is reliable and the authors textual\ntheory goes very much against the great weight\nof \" experimental\" evidence derived from\nscholarly objective Biblical research. Indeed if\nJohn chapters 14 and 16 are read in context\nwith both the Old and New Testaments there\ncan be no mistaking the message that the Holy\nSpirit of God was to and did begin a new type\nof work among men.\nIn conclusion may we say that God's message\nto man in the Bible and supremely through the\nlife, death by crucifixion and resurrection of\nJesus Christ is very clear. That message speaks\nfirst of the enormous DIGNITY of man's creation in the image of God( Genesis lv26, Psalm 8v4,5). It also speaks of the total\nDEPRAVITY of human nature (Romans 3v23) caused by man's rebellion against his Creator\nand the reality of this Sin and resulting -separation from God ending in death (Romans\n6v23). Finally it speaks of the DESTINY of man\nwhich is the fearful prospect of death and God's judgement (Hebrews 9v27,28). It is at this point\nthat God's message of hope through Jesus Christ\ncomes in: God himself in Christ has dealt with\nman's Sin and made a way for man to return to\nHim. At this point Christians rightly tend to\nemploy certain pictures to explain the work that\nChrist accomplished by dying on a Roman Gallows (eg paying the ransom required that\nman might be set free). Whether or not you find\nthe pictures helpful the reality is that Christ\nbore the consequences of our sins (1 Peter 2v24) and to prove his victory over Sin and Death he\nrose from death never to die again (1 Corinthians\n15v3,8). God freely offers forgiveness through\nChrist and new life through the in dwelling of his\nHoly Spirit for those who acknowledge their\nneed (1 John lv8 \u201410).\nThe personal claims of Jesus Christ are\nenormous and his claims on us as individuals are\nequally enormous. No doubt many people in the\npast and today try to avoid these claims by\nrunning away from the facts, but the truth is\nthat about 2000 years ago a Jewish carpenter\nfrom a small town in the Middle East made\nthese claims and substantiated them by his\nvictory over the grave.\nReferences1.
