    "content": "12 NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY28 TH FEBRUARY Opting made\nsimple\nThe Single Transferable Vote (STV) used in\nImperial College Union elections is a more\nsophisticated, and some would say more\ncomplicated system, to the nationally used\nfirst past the post policy. STV allows students to specify not just their first choice of\ncandidate, but also their second, third and\nfourth. In the interests of 'transparency' and\nin order to allow you to best use your vote,\nbelow is a short description of how it all\nworks.\nFilling out the ballot paper is clearly where\nit all starts, and the number of votes you get\ndepends on the number of candidates. With\na maximum of four choices in this year's elections you get to list your preference\nfrom 1 to 4, with your most favoured person\ngetting a1, the next a2 etc. If you only\nhave eyes for one candidate then you do not\nneed to pick a2,3 or 4, your vote is still\nvalid. In this instance you should still however use a1, rather than a tick or a cross.\nWhen all the tens of thousands of ballot\npapers are collected initially only the 1s are\nconsidered and each candidate's first preference vote is counted. To win an ICU sabbatical election in the first round, a candidate\nneeds to receive more than 50% of the valid\nvotes. If one of the candidates has achieved\nthis wonderful ideal, he is declared the winner and the count is finished.\nIf however, as is more likely, none of the\npossibles has managed to inspire such a level of support the second round of counting kicks in. The candidate with the least\nnumber of votes is now eliminated and his\npapers re-examined to consider his voters\nsecond preferences. All the 2s are now distributed to the remaining candidates and the\ntotals re calculated. This process continues until one candidate\nreaches the magical 50% figure. While this\nmay seem a protracted system, counting is\nunlikely to take as long as one recent election in one of the UK's near neighbours\nwhere over seven days of counting was\nneeded to elect one particular member of\nParliament.\nJust in case the above still sounds complicated here's an example of what might hap-pen:\nImagine in an ideal world where the Spice\nGirls suddenly grew brains and were all\nstudying at Imperial College. Being ambitious types they all decide to run for Imperial\nCollege Union President, opposed of course\nby the ubiquitous New Election.\nSuppose having examined their\npolicies in detail you reckon that the\ntwo Mels are on the ball but the rest\nare rather lacking in the ideas\ndepartment you might decide to\nvote like this:\nMel C1 Mel B2 New Election 3\nEmma 4\nVictoria 5\nGeri 6\nAll the votes are counted, with the highest\nturnout ever for an ICU election, and each\ncandidate polls as follows:\nEmma 3,000\nMel B1,500 New Election 800\nMel C700 Geri 600\nVictoria 400\nSpoilt Papers 100\nA total of 7,100 people vote, but unfortunately 100 didn't read this advice and failed\nto fill in their ballot paper properly. This\ntherefore leaves quota, or number votes \u00bb\nneeded for success, at 3,501 or [(7,100 -100) / 2 ]+ 1. Clearly Emma falls just short of\nthe target so now Victoria's first preference\nvote is examined and her 2s are counted. Of\nthe 400 papers, 300 have given Emma a2,50 have given Geri a2 and another fifty only\nhad eyes for Victoria. This leaves the\nrecounted votes like this:\nEmma 3,300\nMel B1,500 New Election 800\nMel C700 Geri 650\nSpoilt Papers 100\nNon Transferable 50\nThe new quota is now 3,301 or [(7,100 - 100\n- 50) / 2 ]+ 1, which Emma just misses. Next\nfor the chop is Geri and her 600 1st preference and the 50 votes she got from Victoria\nare now examined for their respective 2s and 3s. These are then added to the previous figures and the totals are now as fol-lows:\nEmma 3,600\nMel B1,500 MeIC 1,000\nNew Election 800\nSpoilt Papers 100\nNon Transferable 100\nEmma has jumped her final hurdle and is\nduly elected as the President of Imperial\nCollege Union, to tumultuous applause.\n\"If you don't vote your\ntesticles will fall off. It's a proven medical fact.\"\nWell, maybe not, but this is you big\nchance to have a say in how the Union\nis run. It's easy. You don't have to sit on\nany boring committees, and it only takes\na minute to do.\nWhatever you do, the Union does\naffect you. So please take the time to\nvote.\nHow2\nvote?\nTo Vote you will need an ICU membership card. If you don't yet have\none, get it from the Union office (1st floor, Beit Quad).\nVoting takes place in\ndepartments and the\nUnion on Mon 3rd and\nTues 4th March.\nFor details of the voting system,\nsee the article on the left.\nCandidates all shite? Vote New\nElection.\nNominations will be\nre-opened, and other\ncandidates may\nstand.\nRemember, you can vote New\nElection for any post. Only\nthat position will have\nanother election.\n\n"

Born in Cardiff in 1926, Bryan\nColes attended Cardiff High School\nand achieved a first in Metallurgy\nfrom the University of Wales in\n1947. He came to the Department of\nPhysics at Imperial in 1950 as a lecturer in Metal Physics and a year\nlater gained his D. Phil, from Jesus\nCollege, Oxford.\nOn leave from London in\nPittsburgh, Professor Coles was the\nInternational Co-operation\nAdministration Fellow at the\nCarnegie Institute for two years from\n1954. Three years later, he was\nappointed Senior Lecturer in Physics\nat Imperial and then a Reader in\nPhysics in 1962. Professor Coles\nspent the summers of 1962 and 1969\nas a Visiting Professor at the\nUniversity of California in San\nDiego. In October of 1966 he was\nappointed to the Chair of Solid State\nPhysics at Imperial. Closely associated with both the planning and furnishing of the new Physics building,\nthe Blackett Laboratory, Professor\nColes took a keen interest in the\ndevelopment of the College. Before\nbeing appointed Dean of the Royal\nCollege of Science from 1984-1986,\nhe spent the end of 1983 as Hill\nVisiting Professor at the University\nof Minnesota. From 1986-1991,\nProfessor Coles was Pro-Rector of\nImperial College and was then elected to be a Fellow of the Royal\nSociety, where he Chaired the\nScientific Information Committee\nfrom 1993.\nAs Nevill Mott has said, Professor\nColes had devoted his career to the\nexperimental investigation of metallic alloys and their interpretation in\nthe language of quantum mechanics.\nNot only this, but also his work in the\nfield of spin glasses has resulted in\nworld-wide renown. Professor Coles\nprovided inspired leadership in all\nhis work and warm hospitality to the\nmany eminent people who visited\nhim, and to the students taught by\nhim over his years at Imperial.

He served on the\nAdvisory Panel on Study\nInstitutions, NATO Science\nDivision, and was a member of the\nBritish National Committee on\nPhysics. During 1955, Professor\nColes married Merivan Robinson of\nSt. Paul, Minnesota and leaves two\nsons. In his private life, Professor\nColes pursued interests in natural\nhistory, mediaeval architecture and\nopera. Having retired at the beginning of the academic term 1991, he\ncontinued to take an active interest in\nboth his work and the College itself,\nbeing Staff Orator from 1991-1993.\nHis death is a considerable loss to\nboth the College and the scientific\nworld, and he will be sorely missed\nby all who knew him.\nDramsoc\nripped- off?\nNEWS TEAM Recent attempts to publicise\nDramsoc's upcoming production of\nChristopher Marlowe's Edward II\nhave run into difficulties after over\nforty posters were ripped off the\nSherfield walkway notice boards.\nSpeaking to Felix Mike Wyer,\nDramsoc's publicity officer,\ndescribed how an evening's work\nwas mysteriously censored\novernight.\nWith less than half a dozen posters\nremaining from the original fifty,\nspeculation is rife as to why bizarre\nand possibly malicious attack\noccurred. Since the play deals with\nsex, violence, and gay relationships\nit has been suggested that homophobic tendencies may have taken\noffence. Dramsoc sources have\ndenied allegation that they may have\nincited animosity from other\nImperial College Union clubs or\nsocieties, and insist that they will be\nprotesting to the Union.\nSuggestions that this week's high\nwinds may be responsible for the\nposters disappearance have been discounted by Dramsoc members.\nNews in Brief\nUNION BAR WRECKED\nThe Royal School of Mines won the\n\"bottle match\" against the\nCambourne School of Mines last\nSaturday.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY28 TH FEBRUARY COLLEGE HIERARCHY 13\nWould the real Mike\nWhat was your background before coming to\nImperial College?\nWell, I was brought up in Watford. At school I guess I was a scientist. I suppose the place to go\nwas IC. But you wouldn't, nobody ever did, it was\ntoo close to home.\nWhen I was in the lower sixth, my Chemistry\nmaster mentioned that he had received a bursar y from Shell to go to university, so I thought well\nthis sounds good and I wrote to all the big companies I had ever heard of saying I'm a bright kid, I want to go to university, will you pay me, and BP\nput me through university doing Economics and\nChemistry. I ended up in Scotland, University of\nStirling. Stirling spelt with an ' i'.I was employed by BP until four years ago,\nthat's twenty-two years, which was a ball. It was a lot of fun, but I guess I got a middle age crisis or\nsomething. The last ten years were nearly all overseas and I reached a point where I'd had enough. It\nwas at that stage I thought well hang on, I don't want to be at Head Office in London, you know\nbig offices, so that was when I started looking\nabout leaving BP. Then I got a phone call asking\nwhether I would be interested in coming to IC and\nso it all sort of worked out and I ended up here after\nall, I'm delighted to say.\nAnd what did you do within BP, was finance\nyour area?\nWell, when I graduated from the University of\nStirling, I was smart enough, I'm glad to say, to\nrealise that if I ever did want to leave BP aCV with\nUniversity of Stirling on is not that great. It seemed\nsmart to get an additional\nqualification, so I qualified as an accountant\nwhile I was in BP and then\nspent the next twenty\nyears desperately trying\nnot to be an accountant.\nSo you had obviously\nhad enough after t wen ty-two years, but did you generally enjoy your\ntime up until then?\nOh yes, it's a big fun place. If you're an accountant doing things with lots of money is always nice.\nI mean whether you're spending it or borrowing it,\nif its got lots of zeros on the end, it's quite pleas-ant.\nInterestingly, people have asked if it was difficult to come here after working for a multi-nation-al oil company and the answer's no, not at all. The\nculture is actually, strange to say, not that d is simi lar, IC is quite like BP in some ways, in that its\nnumerate, I mean it's engineering y based, it's international, clearly, and it has, what's the word, a confidence i.e. arrogance to the place because IC's good at what it does as is BP.\nHansen please\nforward...\nMike Hansen is Director of Finance at\nImperial College. Glorified accountant\nor essential to the College's future?\n\"...doing things with money is\nalways nice...spending it or\nborrowing it, if it's got lots\nof zeros on the end, it's quite\npleasant.\"\nWhat do actually do as the Director of Finance?\nWhat do I do? Finance is a broad set, it goes\nfrom the making sure staff salaries are paid monthly through to making sure the electricity bills are\npaid otherwise the lights go out. Then there's the\nglamorous bit, dealing with the Executive\nCommittee of the Governing Body and and the\nBoarding Committee. It's a very varied job, in\nsimple terms it's probably anything to do with\nmoney.\nDo you social is e with the\npeople you work with?\nThe place does suffer\nfrom the fact that it is in the\ncentre of London and many\nof the staff commute. 1\nprobably social is e more than I have done with my\nwork colleagues in former places I 've worked but\nI don't spend all my time hanging out with the people I work with. One has different circles of friends\nin different places.\nDo you worry about waste in your department?\nDo you attempt to cut the cost of running\nFinance?\nNot particularly Finance. Obviously we try and\ncut the cost of everything, whatever it is and it's always, a trade off between cutting costs and keeping the services going. There are some things\nwhich are really easy wins, like buying your electricity cheaper. It would be\ndifficult for me to do my job\nif my colleagues didn't think I was at least doing\nmy bit on the efficiency\nfront. I have a completely\nclear conscience on that\nfront.\nYour job is cost-cutting\nand being efficient?\nWell, no, it's getting good value for money on\nthe things I'm involved with whatever that happens to be and obviously, because I look at the\nnumbers more than most, I'm able to do that.\nDo you feel that the administrative staff really\nre agr d themselves as being here for the students\nand because of the students, or do they resent\nhaving to deal with the 'great unwashed'?\nNo, I have got a completely clear conscience on\nthe attitude of my employees. What you don't see\nis the amount of crap they take from certain stu-dents, you don't see the verbal abuse, you don't see\nthe stuff being thrown at them which happens.\nWhat probably annoys me more than anything\nabout this place is an inference that for some reason because people are not directly academically\nstep\n\u201e j Dr Matiui\n1 Dr Rodney Ea\nill Ian Caldwell\nI Lynda Davies\n._) Vernon McC\n\"Last year, we ended up, 90\nof us, at the top of Queen's Tower for a few beers.\"\nrelated, they are somehow less concerned about the\nwell-being of College. It's interesting, when\nUniversity Challenge was on and we were win-ning, it was a real buzz, people at the operational\nlevel were really proud in the pub to say I work at\nImperial College.\nIf someone thinks they\nare not getting a reasonable service then they\nshould complain, if they\ndon't get satisfaction they\nshould come and see me in\nRoom 442 or email me at m. hansen@ic.ac.uk.\nFundamentally, I expect my people, and they know\nit and accept it, to provide a reasonable service. If\nit wasn't for the students and staff we wouldn't be\nhere, the only reason we're here is to make the\nwhole thing work.\nBeing on the Bookstore committee, why did you\ngive Waterstones the tender?\nI don't think it's fair to give my personal opinion because it was a committee decision. What I'm happy to say is that I have no doubt that our main\nconcern was to get the best bookshop. Whether it\nwas the right decision or not, some people believe\nthe Union could have done better because of their\ncommit t ment. I don't know but I'm absolutely sure\nthat it was done in a completely fair and open-minded way and that the union was well- represented. It was difficult, if they'd done a really bum\njob it would have been easy but they didn't, they\ndid a really good presentation. There was a difference of views, people had different standpoints but\nat the end of the day, I don't think that anybody\nwould say that they didn't fully agree with the\ndecision. I 'll be very d is a pointed if we don't end\nup with a very good bookshop,\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\nIt depends on the day I suppose. I do social running once a week with the City Hash House\nHarriers, I was pounding around Bayswater last\nnight. We've run from the Southside bar on two or\nthree o cass ions this year.\nHave you ever run in the Marathon?\nNo, it's a drinking club with a running problem,\nreal athletes need n't apply! We're not very serious.\nWe start from the pub, run the circle back, and\nspend a few hours drinking. Last year we ended up,\nninety of us, at the top of the Queen's Tower for a few beers.\nInterview: Maria, Photo: Robin\n\n"

Damon Hill is determined to\nremain competitive, and Olivier\nPanis could yet win more races in an\nimproved Ligier owned by Alain\nProst. There are also a couple of new\nboys, Jackie Stewart's new tartan\nteam with Rubens Barrichello still\nremain an unknown quantity but are\nlikely to provide a few surprises.\nSomethings however will not\nchange, just as the marshals thought\nthe gravel traps were looking tops,\nPedro Diniz and Ukyo Katayama in\nnice new cars will still be there\ndestroy all that raking and write off a a couple of hundred thousand\npounds worth of car each race.\nIn the floodlit one day series down\nunder, England and New Zealand are\ndoing something strange.

In fact this was\nmerely members of the IC pistol\nsquad trying to make the seven\nO 'Clock start time for the British\nUniversity Pistol Championships.\nThe IC rifle and pistol club was\nthere this year and had high hopes to\nplace well. Captain Rickee delivered\nus to Bisley just in time to begin the\nmorning's shooting of small bore target pistol. We fell immediately\nbehind, but were no de moral is ed as\n.22 is for girls anyway.\nThe afternoon saw some superb\nshooting of full bore revolvers by all\nteams involved. After a day dogged\nby jamming guns and other technical\nproblems, it was a credit to IC that all\nthree teams still managed to finish in\nsecond place, yet again hammering\nour arch-rivals Cambridge (we're not\nafraid of them. Grrrrrrrrrr).\nAfter this sterling performance\nand the night's revelries that fol-lowed, one would have thought that a Sunday lie in was in order. Instead,\nhowever, we all congregated in Hyde\npark (along with about twenty-five\nthousand others) for a sportsman's association march and rally to protest\nagainst the new gun legislation.\nThis was thoroughly groovy hap-pen ing, only slightly marred by the\nextreme ugliness of the Oxford pistol\nteam, the winners of the BUPC.\nThe nest event in our calender is\nthe Courtman Shield on Saturday\nMarch the eighth. This is an intercollegiate rifle competition.\nShooters go on the pull\nA dozen shooters went to Hawley in\nKent to try their hands at clay pigeon\nshooting. After a brief introduction,\nthe motley crew settled down to a twenty-five bird sporting layout (for\nthe uninitiated: bird = clay pigeon;\nsporting layout = one way of positioning the clay pigeon launchers and\ntiming of the \"birds\" being flung up\nin the air) followed by some skeet\nshooting ( = another way of positioning the launchers - this time they\ncome from the left and right simultaneously). The guns were as assorted\nas the shooters, ranging from a Russian hammer gun bought in a pub\nfor \u00a350 to Lawrence's \u00a320 000\nPurdey purchased for him at birth by\nhis father. The scores were variable\nbut the best of the day was by David\nthe Hairdresser (special rates for stu-dents) closely followed by David\nChilds, to a rather low score from\nStavros.\nMarcos Dakalakalakalakalakas\nsuffered injuries to his trigger finger\nwhen he fell out of his pram while\ncrying about French culture. Tea was\ntaken in Dartford followed by beer in\nSouthside where everyone was\nimpressed by Lee's impression of a second-hand beer dispensing\nmachine in an impromptu game of\n\"Whose Line is it Anyway.\" involving tomfoolery with b elisha beacons.\nThe Courtman Shield match has\nbeen moved to the eighth of March to\nallow the City and Guilds dream\nteam to shoot for Great Britain, so\nmake a note in your diary. More clay\npigeon shooting will take place\naround Easter and everyone (even\nnon-members) are welcome. See the\nnotices in the range when they go up.\n\n"

He thought that MSC and club treasurers\nwould have an easier job \"if they have previous examples\" of Budget\nand 5 Year Plan submissions.\nHe claimed that we should ensure that \"College knows the student\npopulous wasn't happy with\" losing the Bookstore, although he\nemphasised that it was \"just one part of one of the Union's trading\narms.\" He said that the loss could raise interest from the students\nand that \"we have learnt a number of lessons\" from the experience.\nIn defence of the current sabbaticals, he admitted that \"it was a very difficult situation for the Union to be in\" and that \"whatever happened the s a bbs would be blamed.\"\nOn the future of ICU Bookstore, Duncan made the point that \"there\nwill be more space for stationery, regalia and things like that\". Finally\nhe said that they would have to \"think quite hard\" about their options\nwith the Bookstore.\nRobert Clarice\nRobert stated that he had \"an ideal perspective\" due to his experience in Industry. He also would like to see stronger communication,\nespecially with academic staff, saying that \"academic staff do tend to\nlisten, far more than people give them credit for\".\nHe pointed out that \"its the average club treasurer who has to draw\nup the 5 Year Plan\" and thus they should be given more help, particularly details of previous years' finances. He also suggested that the\ntraining given to \"people like club treasurers is not significant\nenough\".\nStill on the topic of training, he felt that it could be expanded to\nteach MSC treasurers \"how they can train their clubs to improve the\ninput of 5Y Ps, budgets and costings.\" Robert stressed it was important for there to be \"a general filtering down of information from the\ntop,\" such as providing justification when 5Y Ps are cut.\nCommenting on the loss of the Bookstore, Robert said that he felt\n\"its a bit of a disgrace that we lost it\". But as the contracts were\nsigned all that could be done \"is ensure that this type of thing never\nhappens again\". He recommended that there should be \"some deep\nthought\" into what the Union will use the current Bookstore site for.\nWith regard to tenders, he claimed the Union has \"got to be strident\nand actively chasing them\".\nHe thought that the Union should seek to raise its profile \"so that\npeople understand why we needed the bookstore\" and the importance of financial independence.\nHe proposed that ICU ought to make use of its \"direct 1-1 contact\nwith many members of staff\" and warned that there was a risk that\n\"Waterstones will stock a very limited range of high profile books.\"\nJohn Savery\nJohn started by drawing attention to his experience in SCAB, as Chair\nand Treasurer. He claimed that in the last year \"things have improved\nsignificantly\" in SCAB. He said that \"the next big thing\" would be the\nmove of medical schools to the South Ken campus. He mentioned\nthat it was \"a bit worrying\" that the new halls have not yet received\nplanning permission, and that when Biology moves out of Beit Quad\n\"there isn't going to be any building time\" to expand ICU. Stressing\nthat \"the first year is going to be really hard work\" due to the\nincreased demand on space and services.\nOn the subject of communication, John stated that \" MSC chairs\nget a hell of a lot of flak\" and highlighted the need to \"work together\nas a team.\"\nTo help clubs prepare 5Y Ps and budgets, he recommended that\nDP(F&S) should give more information on the previous year's sub mis sion, in particular why it was cut. He thought that \"we need to be a lot more open in what we say and do.\"\nSpeaking about the Bookstore he said that no matter what is done\n\"it's not going to win us it back.\" But we should \"make students\nrealise\" what services ICU provides and how they can influence\nthem.\nICU must advertise itself more, he claimed. If people had been better informed about the Bookstore \"there would have been a lot\nmore... gut feeling about it\".\nAs to the future of the Bookstore, he said that we could \"ask the\nstudent what they want ... on their campus\", making the point that\n\"nobody's asked that question yet.\"\nPresident\nOmar Kheir\nAsked initially why he is standing for President, Omar emphasised the\nfact that he has \"been here a long time\", and of his experience \"from\nthe whole thing.\" He was unable however to suggest two things\nwhich he would do during his year in the post saying, \"I can't tell you\nwhat I'm going to do. I couldn't honestly make any promises.\"\nWith the recent loss of the Union bookstore, Omar was pessimistic\nabout College's assurance to refund lost profits commenting, \" if they\nwant to do something else they will and there's not much we can do\nabout it.\" He also suggested that \"people are making a lot of fuss\nover an issue I don't feel too strongly about\" and that he doesn't see\nit as a \"horrible loss.\"\nFollowing his joke manifesto, Omar refuted suggestions that he is\nnot a serious candidate insisting that he had been trying to \"make an\nimpact\" and that \"there are some subtle digs in my manifesto.\" He\ndid admit though that there were irregularities with his nomination\npapers and that his proposer did not actually sign them, as required by\nthe ICU Constitution.\nOn the issue of future education funding, Omar emphasised his\npersonal preference for a form of graduate tax, and said that unless\nhe is advised otherwise by IC students this would be his public line as\nPresident.\nCommenting on why people should vote for him, Omar suggested\nthat since he is a \"people person\", he expects support \"simply\nbecause they know me or they've been recommended to vote for\nme.\"\nSam Baker\nPointing to her role as Academic Affairs Officer with the RCS and her\nposition as Dance Club President, Sam suggested that she was a suitable candidate as she had \"seen things from different angles.\"\nQuestioned as to what she would do as President she responded that\n\"you can't move mountains\", but that if elected she would do her\nbest to \"represent all of the students at IC\".\nOn the issue of the loss of the Union bookstore she felt that\n\"there's nothing we can really do about that, we can just work on\nwhat we do have.\" Sam suggested that she would attempt to keep\nCollege to their commitment to make up lost profits by \"liaising with\nCollege.\"\nAsked about her limited experience, Sam admitted that \"perhaps\ncompared to Omar yes I 've got a lot more limited range of experiences.\" She insisted however that her experience of Academic Affairs\nwould do \"nothing but help me\".\nSam conceded that on the issue of future student funding, \"I don't have a firm idea at all\" but insisted that \"I don't believe as President I should have.\" She emphasised that she would represent all IC stu-dents, but had difficulty saying how she would obtain a \"consensus of\nopinion\" on this matter.\nPeople should vote for her because \"I can do the job, I'm willing to\ndo it\", she said, adding that \"I'm not just going for the people who\nknow me, think I'm a great person, if they like what they see and\nbelieve I can do the job then they should vote for me.\"\n\n"

    "content": "6 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY28 TH FEBRUARY Are Imperial College students\nThis sound-The differences between the various\nHalls of Residence of Imperial\nCollege were recently brought to my\nattention. A resident of Fisher Hall\ncommented to me that on a recent\nvisit to Holbein Hall he had been\namazed at the difference between the\nstandards of repair. He gushed on\nabout the mirrors, the pastel shaded\nwalls and the up-lighting, then said:\n\"God, they must be paying a fortune.'\ned like a challenge to me, so after a bit of wrangling I managed to get hold of all the rents for the\nhalls (see table below).\nLike me you'll probably have noticed that\nHolbein and Fisher Halls have the same prices, as\ndo the halls in Prince's Gardens. But why should\nthis be so? Why is Garden Hall cheaper than the\nrest of Prince's Gardens? Time for a quick call to\nthe Accommodation Office. Sadly this was not too\nuseful. Sharine Brown, the Residences Manager\ngave the new prices for halls next year. Those costing \u00a347.53 are going up to \u00a349.00 and the halls\ncosting \u00a358.31 will go up to \u00a360.06, except Fisher\nwhich has been reduced to \u00a353.13, but apart from\nthat, nothing, nada, zip, zilch.\nI was referred to Piers Williams on the grounds\nthat she didn't \"know enough about (the subject)\"\nand \"only wanted to deal with facts\". Piers\nexplained that this year the accommodation levels\nwere being set by himself and the Union\nAccommodation Officer. They had\nduly traipsed round all the halls and\nset the levels accordingly.\nFisher Hall was apparently refurbished 7 years ago and Holbein, 3.\nThese cosmetic renovations have justified an increase in rent. Speaking as\nsomeone who didn't get a choice into\nwhich hall I went into, I find it a little unfair that. Why should I be\nforced to pay \u00a310 pw more than other\nresidents in Evelyn Gardens for no\nnoticeable difference? The rooms are\ngenerally accepted to be smaller and,\nto quote a visiting friend, \"crap\".\nFrankly speaking, the whole building\nis in a state of disrepair. I cannot\nactually recall having seen a wall\nwith paint not d is coloured and peeling off.\nIf Fisher is better than Southwell\nand Willis Jackson then I don't mind\npaying more but I REALLY object to\npaying as much as Prince's Gardens.\nWhat does Evelyn Gardens have\ncompared to Southside? A shop? A Pizza place? A student bar?\nProximity to college? Connections to\nthe college Computer network? No.\nThe only link to College is the single\ntelephone line up to the main cam-pus, but since the internal phones\ndon't work with the ACC discount\nphone cards it is of no use.\nSuitably riled, my partner and I Simon Wistow and his cohorts of\nmackintosh-clad investigators\nturn their skills to Imperial's housing problem...\nWelcome to my home\nHALL Prince's Gardens\nBeil (old hostel)\nBeit (new hostel)\nFalmouth Keogh\nSelkirk\nTizard\nWeeks\nGarden\nLinstead (catered)\n\u00a347.53\n\u00a358,3! \u2022\nt.5S3i' \u00a358.31\n\u00a358.31\n\u00a358.31\n\u00a347.53\n\u00a358.31 + ':\n\u00a333.32\n\u00a340.8 i meals\nBcnsard Suntey \u00a347.53 \u00a333.32\nFisher S.310.81 Holbein \u00a358.31 \u00a340.81\nSouthwell \u00a347.53 \u00a333.32\nWillisJackson \u00a347.53 \u00a333.32\ni'V Montpelier (upgraded)\nMontpelier (non-upgraded)\n0 : ' ' H Tjse\n\u00a347.53\n\u00a356.49 \u00a339.55\n\u00a3\u2022:-::: vt:&' House \u00a336.33\n; \u2022 '\nRoom A Room B Room C Ensuite\n1\n1 beds it: r. beds it Wilson House\nPre-elin ical room\nClinical room\nClinical room\ner day; Washing m1. ill w. nd c n,.ip pu\"(i 'acquired' a copy of the Confidential\nStrategy for the Future Development\nand Management of Student\nResidences. We began to skim read\nthrough it looking for juicy titbits to\nhighlight\nInterestingly enough, the Powers\nthat be seem to be aware of the problems, concerning Imperial's bed stock, as well they should. To quote the\nreport, Imperial College is aware that the rents are\nhigh \"relative to competitors, both London based\nand provincial\". They also accept that IC halls\noffer \"questionable value for money in certain residences where there is a severe maintenance back-log.\"\nBack in 1993, however, an exhaustive plan to\n\"overcome perceived competitive weaknesses in\nthe physical condition of the residences and excessive variations in standards of maintenance\nbetween residences and increase value for money\"\nwas drawn up.\nThis resolved to \"establish minimum acceptable\nand targeted standards for all student accommodation in terms of furnishings, equipment, decorative\norder, cleanliness and all round value for money,\nand ensure that all existing residence meet the minimum standard by the end of 1993/4 and targeted\nstandards by 1995/6\". Included in this is a \"rolling\nprogramme of re decoration three year internal\ncycle, five years external\". Hmm, has this hap-pen ed? First impressions say not.\nOn a more serious note, Fisher Hall\n(together with other halls in Evelyn\nGardens) is under Leasehold for the\nnext 50 years. Although the report\nresolved to begin negotiation with the\nrelevant landlord for outright pur-chase, the report also highlights the\nCollege's relative lack of funds and\ninability to raise finance at acceptable\nrates. This may explain the discrepancy between the 'three year plan' and\nreality. Worryingly, they seem to be\noverly concerned that the poor condition of halls reduces their chances of\n\"profitable disposal\". In other words,\nthey seem to give priority to getting\nhalls in a condition fit to sell, rather\nthan fit to live in. Furthermore, sections discussing the possibility of halls\nbeing forced to close if they could not\nmeet Health and Safety standards (and\nforming suitable contingency plans)\ndoes nothing to inspire confidence in\nhousing standards.\nThrough further acquisitive act iv i ties, we found ourselves in possession\nof the NUS Accommodation Costs\nSurvey 1996/97, which covers private\nsector and university rents at all universities in the UK. The main findings\nwere as follows:\n\u2022The average weekly costs across all\ntypes of institutional accommodation\nin 1996/97 was \u00a348.37.\nTRIPLE\n\u00a323J0 f \u00a323.8(1\nFELIX FRIDAY28 TH FEBRUARY NEWS 7\npaying too much for their rent?\nPHOTO: SIMON The inviting interior of Fisher Hall's showers. Students share their daily ablutions with flakes of\npaint, mould and mushrooms.\n\u2022The average weekly rent for private accommodation in 1996/97 was \u00a340.12.\n\u2022The average cost of institutional accommodation\nincreased by 4.7% between 1995/96 and 1996/97\n(actually Imperial only increased by 2.6%, hurrah).\n\u2022Average, non-institutional rents increased by\n3.8% between 1995/96 and 1996/97.\n\u2022A student living in institutional accommodation in\nreceipt of a full grant and student loan did, on aver-age, spend 63% of their weekly income on rent.\n\u2022A student living in the private rented sector did,\non average spend 52% of his her weekly income on\nrent.\nMy conclusion is mixed. Imperial College is\naware of the problems they face with their bed-stock. Union input into accommodation charges\nmay help matters. Given the exclusivity (read cost)\nof our Kensington location and the crippling lack\nof funds, things could be worse. On a more subjective note, however, there is a need to address the\nimbalance of rents charged within Imperial's halls.\nPerhaps some money should be spent on the residences that need sprucing up.

    "content": "14 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY28 TH FEBRUARY Lord Grade, cigar smoking supremo\nand the TV moguls TV mogul, once\nhad a dream. It was at the time that\nJesus of Nazareth had been made,\nand Lew was trying to sell it to the\nAmerican networks. One night he\nhad a vision seeing a large '25'. This,\nhe thought, must be the price of the\nfilm. Can't be 25 or 25,000, so it\nmust be 25,000,000. He duly got $25\nmillion, twice what they were initially prepared to pay for it. I also had a dream in which a large '18'\nappeared. This means nothing, I thought, besides an indication that I must be working too hard. Days\nlater, while wandering through the\nSCR, as you do, all be came clear. As\nyou know, dear reader, my hearing is\nphenomenally good, so I couldn't help but overhear a conversation\nabout '18'. As with Lord Grade, it\nmeant 18 million. It's the Sherfield\nbudget for 1996/97.\nAs you can imagine my ears pricked\nup considerably at this stage. I caught\nthe word 'Estates', this time from\nanother part of the SCR. My head\nturned. Apparently, they expect to\nspend about \u00a38 million in the coming\nyear. Fair enough. Big department,\nlot of expenses, but also with a lot of\nincome from the Halls of Residence.\nA lot indeed, about \u00a3695,000 from\nApril to September or minus\n\u00a3215,000 after expenses, according\nto my indiscreet fellow diners. Still,\nnever mind, the planned expansion of\nconferencing will bring in the dr ach mas. Oh dear. It's the students that\nbankroll Estates, not conferencing\nwhich is a loss-maker, due to the\nalready slapdash control of costs\ngoing for a Burton as IC kindly offer\nto employ every stu- Ci yy-if\\ y\\ dent who's not on\nholiday to look after\nthe guests and clean the\nrooms. In other\nwords, the mor\nwe build, the\nmore we lose. M Realising this, jj l it seems that J H conferencing, f the great white !\nhope of IC\nand Campus 1\nRenaissance, \\ ~\nis as safe a bet \u2022 ,\nas a seaside r* donkey in the \\\nGrand National.\nThey also men\ntio ned that Clayponds \\\nspends almost five times\nmore on gardening\nthan security con- Vol CC Of tracts, which I'm sure will delight the residents.\nWalking by the BMS, someone\nshouted over the noise of concrete\nmixers that the communal areas,\nwhich were cut from 800 to 600 sq m have been further 'redesigned' to\nconsist of a coffee machine, possibly\non the fourth floor. You seem upset,\ndoctor?\nI think I then heard Finance's name\nmentioned. I can't be certain, but I'm sure someone said \u00a32.3 million. That\nRn l/ar seems rather a lot of\nmoney spent for a department that is\nsupposed to be careful\nth the cash, Ih ought. Still, it's a ig university, lot\nof departments\netc. Hmm.\nNottingham University is\nabout 60-70%\nthe size of us.\nhey have less\nlan 10 people\nin their finance\noperation, whereas our\n)hone book lists\njust over 100. Now\nar be it from me to\nmake crude comparisons,\nbut this looks a tad\nR CCl SO llc x ccs sive. Perhaps\nNottingham contract work out and if so, why don't we, since I doubt it could cost more\nthan the current setup. Some careless\nsoul on another table remarked that\nto ensure that proper checks are kept\non spending, we spend nearly\nff just\n\u00a3150,000 on internal audits. So rigorous are these checks, my own department has taken to cleaning the inside\nof windows that haven't had their\noutside cleaned for 30 years and ferrying students up to St Mary's in\ntaxis so the poor dears can attend lectures scheduled with no consultation\nbetween the two. God help us if we\ndidn't have an audit.\nRegistry's getting \u00a32 million said\nsomeone on the walkway who\nshould have known better. This\nseems rather excessive for a department that issues certificates and\nexam timetables. It's not short of\nstaff, as I have said before, but for\nthat to explain a budget of more than\na couple of hundred thousand, they\nwould need more people than could\nphysically squeeze onto level 3.1 just\ncan't think where all that money\ngoes- answers on a postcard.\nIn short, you learn a lot from pinning\nback the ears round here. It's all very\nwell College constantly pleading\npoverty, but when details like this\ncome to the fore, it is very difficult to\nhave any sympathy. Academic\ndepartments are having to make genuine cuts, but Sherfield ploughs its\nmerry furrow, stuck in the 1970s, oblivious to the real world. IC has an\nexcellent Management School and a central management unaware of its\nteachings - Discuss.\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nA programme depicting sexual abuse\nwas broadcast on ITV this week. \"No\nChild of Mine\" - commissioned by\nMeridian Broadcasting - depicting\nthe gradual fall of a kind but weak\nman into a pimp and abuser, with the\nghouls of our nightmares reconciled\nwith the family next door. Comments\nwere mainly along the usual lines,\nthat such things ought not to be\nshown on our screens.\nOne may ask: who makes these\ncomments? Who is kindly deciding\nwhat the public ought and ought not\nto watch? Mainly it is journalists and\nback bench MPs, plus occasionally\ncouncillors and various pressure\ngroups. These groups of people certainly don't spring out at me a being\nrepresentative of the public as a whole: in fact each job requires\nsomeone with a big mouth and a willingness to use it.\nA perfect example of this is\nWestminster City Council's decision\na few months ago to ban JG Ballard's 'Crash', a film depicting fantasies\nabout car crash victims, from screens\nwithin its area. The British Board for\nFilm Classification had already given\nit an 18 Certificate, but Westminster\nused its legal right to ban it anyway,\npreventing a large number of West\nEnd cinemas from showing it. I can\nbe more precise about who made this\ndecision - it was a bunch of council-lor s, most of whom admitted not having seen the film (\"but that is not the\npoint\" said one councillor) and were\ntaking a wonderful opportunity to get\nthemselves onto news programmes\nand newspaper pages with long\ntirades against the tide of filth and\ntheir brave defence of decency.\nWhen listening to their speeches, I couldn't help be reminded of how\nsimilar it sounded to dictatorial governments defending their right to\ncensor news reports and opposing\nviews. Both arguments stated that the\nState had to act for the common good\nin defiance of certain members of the\npublic. Of course the good councillors aren't despots, but their censoring of a film that they hadn't seen,\nbased on their own opinions, which\nwere not in the least representative of\nthe public's is dangerous and bad.\nIt is perfectly possible for a film to\nbe shown only on cinema, or for\nmore cuts to be made in a video version of a particular film. Natural\nBorn Killers, a film of similar ill-repute, was shown on cinema, with\ncuts, and its release on video has\nbeen suspended indefinitely. The\nBBFC is publicly accountable for its\nactions, and this is the best compromise we can have between decency\nand undue censorship.\nThe media are another part of the\nproblem: they are always willing to\nexaggerate and fan the flames when\nsomething comes out on television.\nIn nearly every report on such pro-gram mes, you will find a quote by\nMary Whitehouse. All they have\nreally done is phoned her up, saying\nthere's a new revolting programme\nout and what does she think about it?\nTheir tendency to give column inches to the people mentioned above just\nbiases the argument and creates a bigger news story out it, since plenty\nof people are always ready to jump\non the bandwagon and publicise\nthemselves before an election.\nIn any democracy freedom of\nchoice of the individual is of paramount importance, with the authorities giving adults suitable guidance\nand allowing them to see what they\nwish. Britain has some of the strictest\ncodes on television and video ratings,\nand they are unlikely to change given\nthe influence of the censorship lobby\non these issues.\nCouncils should be wary of using\npowers of censorship - the opinions\nof aw hinging few should not be\nassumed to be those of the public at\nlarge.\n\n"

Fears that the\nwork wouldn't meet the strict timing\ntargets have been assuaged by re jigging of the work.\nFrom the Queen's Lawn, the Biomedical Science building is a cluster\nof concrete pillars and steel poles.\nBehind the scaffold facade, the site's170 workers are currently laying the\nsteel supports for the final two stories\nand completing the internal walls on\nthe lower levels. Concrete laying was\nhindered by the weather and has subsequently overrun its schedule.\nThe next stage, the steel superstructure for the top two floors, has\nhad to start without the concrete\nbeing finished.

The atrium, which will\nhave a clear roof, will have a glass\ndivider between the first and second\nfloors to prevent noise rising from the\npublic lower floors to the research\nlevels above.

Centre pages.\nSomething for the\nWeekend says Take\nme to your leader'\nNew Election favourite after Kheir withdraws\nNEWS TEAM The result of next week's Imperial\nCollege Union Sabbatical Elections\nhangs in the balance today, following the shock withdrawal of one of\nthe two Presidential candidates.\nOmar Kheir, considered by many as\nthe favourite for the job, confirmed\nhis withdrawal from the elections\nyesterday leaving Samantha Baker\nstanding agian st 'New Election'.\nMr Kheir's withdrawal follows a series of rumours concerning his\nhealth and the pressures of his work\nas a postgraduate in the Electrical\nEngineering Department. Mr Kheir\nmet Eric Allsop, the current ICU\nPresident, early yesterday morning\nto com firm his withdrawal from the\nsabbatical race.\nAt the time of going to press, Mr\nKheir was unavailable for comment,\nbut Mr Allsop later outlined some of\nthe factors contributing to his dec i sion. The former candidate has been\nill for the last two weeks, and was\nonly able to attend the College\nbriefly to write his name on the nomination papers. This may explain the\nlack of a campus-wide poster campaign promoting Mr Kheir, as is traditional for ICU sabbatical can di dates.\nIn addition, Mr Kheir's Electrical\nEngineering research team is reported to be facing a critical publication\ndeadline for their work, in direct\ncompetition with other groups. Mr\nKheir is believed to have been under\nsevere pressure from his supervisor,\nwith a suggestion that his PhD might\nbe in jeopardy were he to devote too\nmuch time to his Presidential cam-pa ign. As returning officer for the elections, Mr Allsop expressed regret\nconcerning Omar's decision. He\nclaimed to be \"saddened by the lack\nof competition\" in the race for the\npost of Union President, which now\nsees Royal College of Science Academic Affairs Officer Samantha\nBaker as the single, uncontested can-did ate. Speaking to Felix, Miss\nBaker admitted \"I still have to convince students that I'm the best can-did a te...I will continue campaigning\nas before.\"\nFollowing this week's farcical\nhustings, and the lacklustre campaigning by some candidates, many\nstudents voting in Monday and\nTuesday's election may choose to\nreturn 'New Election' for the position of President. Were this the case,\nnominations for President would be\nreopened, allowing new and potentially better candidates to stand.\nAlthough unusual, such a result\nseems increasingly likely as medical\nstudents at St Mary's Hospital Medical may choose to 'block vote' for a new election; It is believed that the\nmedics had originally planned to\nvote for Mr Kheir, who now openly\nsupports the re-opening of nominations. Many students at the South\nKensington campus have similarly\nexpressed their disaffection towards\nthe candidates standing for all four\nposts.\nWere the ICU Presidential elections to be re-held, a number of\nprospective candidates have hinted\nthat they might stand. Robin Riley,\nICU's Publications Board Chairman,\nis alleged to have signed a statement\nconfirming his intention to run for\nthe post. Another likely candidate\nmay be Royal College of Science\nUnion President, Mo Dulloo. \"At the\nmoment I can't say anything\" said\nMr Dulloo, but went on to say \"Once\na new election's certain, it will be an\ninteresting contest with Robin.\"\nA precedent for a new presidential\nelection to be run was set in 1974\nwhen the race was run four times.\nAnger at hustings debacle\nNEWS TEAM The low turnout for both of this\nweek's sabbatical election hustings,\non Tuesday in South Kensington and\non Wednesday in St Mary's, with\nfew impartial observers attending\nhas once again demonstrated the\nlack of student interest in Union\naffairs.\nJeremy Thomson, standing unopposed for the position of Felix Editor, refused to be drawn regarding\nhis plans for Felix next year, but\nhighlighted his background as Arts\nEditor. He faced particular hostility\nfrom St Mary's over his ignorance\nregarding topical medical issues.\nNext up were the two candidates\nstanding for Deputy President\n(Clubs&Societies), Sarah Thomas\nand Smita Chaturvedi, who confirmed that they came from similar\nhockey backgrounds, and who managed to give similar answers to many\nof the questions. Ms Thomas' proposer got the biggest cheer of the\nnight from the medics when she\nresponded to a frontal fl anning with\n\"Let's face it, it's not the first time\nthat I 've had cream on my tits and it\nwon't be the last.\"\nThe post of Deputy President\n(Finance&Services) had three can di dates, Rob Clark, John Savery and\nDuncan Tindall, whose manifestos\nand answers had strikingly few differences between them. One notable\nincident was Mr Clark's downing of\neight pints in quick succession.\nThe two candidates for ICU President, Sam Baker and Omar Kheir,\nproved the most controversial with\ngeneral incredulity at their flippant\napproach to the South Kensington\nhustings and their ignorance of serious issues.\nAt first event Sam proposed turning ICU into a brothel with Omar\nretorting with his wish to see a playpen in Beit Quad. After the second hustings Piers Williams, current\nDP(F&S) and co-or d in at or of the\nNew Election campaign, commented\nto Felix that he would have said\nmore on behalf of New Election but\nfelt that it wasn't needed as \"all the\nother candidates seemed to be doing\nmy job for me.\"\n\n"

    "content": "18 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY28 TH FEBRUARY Skiers have a( snow) ball\nOn Saturday evening, two football\nfans (Nick and Gilles) joined three\nother eager skiers (Cait, Ruffina and\nDan) after the Man Utd-Chelsea\ngame for a race at Hillingdon ski c en tre. This was the final stage of the\nHuskis race series, and the evening\nstarted with individual racing.\nGilles (Ginardelli's fellow countryman) had a quiet start as it was his\nfirst race since his accident. An\nexcellent second run placed him\ntenth in his age group.\nAfter a storming first run provisionally placed her first in her group,\nRuffina had a bit of bad luck in the\nsecond and fell due to going into her\ninside edge. This also scuppered her\nchances of a high placing in the individual tables.\nThis wasn't to be the last of our\nbad luck. Cait, our star racer and\nfavourite in the overall girls event,\nclipped a gate in her first run, spinning her through 180 degrees and\ndestroying her chances. She however\nproved she was the best in her second\nrun as she finished it in 13.49 sees,\nsome 0.55 ahead of the next com pet i tor. Nick finished two good runs with\na total time of 29.04, putting him second in his age group and ninth over-all. Finally Dan had a good run with\ntwo of his best runs this season - his\naggregate time of 29.26 placing him\nthird in his group and fifth overall.\nThese results put IC in second\nplace, behind Holloway. In the final\nevent of the day, our true potential\nfinally showed by winning the dual\nteam slalom. Even though we had a tough draw we beat Holloway in the\nquarter-finals, leaving us Hillingdon\nin the semis. With a bit of luck and\ngood planning we pressured one of\ntheir racers to miss a gate and qualified for the final.\nIn the final we triumphed gloriously due to the collective effort of the\nteam, with some outstanding starting\nand racing by Gilles and from Cait\nwho withstood the pressure of having\nthe second best racer of the day on\nher tail.\nThe only thing left to say is that we\ntruly kicked some butt!\nDream win for Arabian knights\nBy Saiful Alam\nThe long awaited OSC 5-a side football tournament finally took place on\nSunday 16th February. The event\nwas sponsored by Sport and Leisure\n(aka - IC Sports Centre).\nOnly eight societies turned up with\nsquads on the day, but the favourites\nwere all there. Some of the others\nblamed the weekends' 'open-hous-es', parties and fiestas for their play-ers' absences.\nTwo groups of four teams were\ndrawn, and the top two from each\nwere allowed to go on to play for the\nhonours. The four others were fighting it out for pride.\nAlthough there was some tension\nduring the games - there were no\nmajor outbursts, as anticipated by the\norganisers. In general, the games\nwere played in good spirit.\nIt was a 'funny old tournament'.\nThe Bangladeshi All Stars beat the\nTurkish Delights in the third place\nplay-off even though the Turks\nthrashed the Bangladeshis in the\nqualifiers. Similarly, the High-flying\nHellenics were unbeaten all day, but\nthey were outplayed by the Arabian\nKnights when it mattered most - in\nthe finals.\nOn behalf of the OSC I would like\nto thank Sport and Leisure for their\nsupport, Alex Neilsen for organising\nthe event, and all the participants\nwho made this event a success. There\nare plans for this making this tournament an annual event from here on.\nFinally, congratulations to the Arabic\nSociety team - \"maas ha allah\". BUSA de-booster for fourths\nA defeat in BUSA spells the end of a glorious run, but the fourths need to\npick themselves up from this defeat\nand concentrate on the league.\nIt all went pear-shaped in the first\nfew minutes when our keeper misjudged a routine shot, and then\nanother defensive mistake put IC two\ndown after only ten minutes.\nIn truth there was no way back\nfrom here against a strong Anglian\nside, but brave, or in hindsight fool-ish, substitutions gave IC a sniff. In\nthe second half we got it back to 2-1\nand then 3-2, with the supremely\ngifted Morgan expertly finishing\nfrom a Nak pass, and a brilliant solo\ngoal from Pete.\nPushing men forward in the final\nminutes and defensive errors meant\nthat UEA secured the win. We were\nby no means disgraced, but if the\nmistakes by the captain and keeper\nhad been cut-out it could have been\noh so different.\nICFC TV 4 - 2 UEA TV\nRugby ref ruc k up\nWell, we have some good news and\nsome bad news. Good news - we\nwon. Bad news - we lost! The refer-ee! Where was he? This lack of an\nofficial referee resulted in us forfeiting the game and so we have now\nbeen knocked out of BUSA. True to\nthe spirit of IC rugby we played anyway and the 32-12 score line in our\nfavour was not enough to secure an\nofficial victory. All our efforts, and\nthose of star full-back Chris went to\nwaste. The bastard referee.\nUncontested scrum s obviously\nworked in our favour as the more\npowerful forwards dominated in\nruc ks and mauls and the backs ran\nrings round their opposite numbers.\nPeachy's passing simply defied logic\n(Julian \"captain concrete\" Harrison)\nagain. Manny muller ed, Peachy prattled on and Rob rampaged. Mart's play was much improved after his\nredemption at Church (or was it in\nthe toilet?), but his second row com-patria te James Weekes, well, need\nwe say more [actually it would have\nhelped! Sp.

Dave turned up - cheers.\nKolbne showed his \"eau de\" with\nserious runs and big pants. Yomi\ndemonstrated his spacial is t scrum-half abilities. Bollocks! He tells me\nthat he scored a try but it was slightly dubious. Nim \"No Stud(s)\" failed\nutterly in his attempts to get on the\npitch because Manny and I[ Rob\n\"Fluffy, shaving foam on his head\"]\nwere just too good (well, fat).\n\"Thanks\" go to Trefor for very quiet\nsupport. Mo says Jasper is \"well-fit.\"\nAll in all we had a great season,\nbut finally I feel that I must sum up.\nGive us aC; give us aU; give us an\nN; give us aT. And what have you\ngot... the referee.\nWind-sock win shock for firsts\nFor once, IC first footballers arrived\non time, and with a full team. After\nUCL's last pasting by us we expected them not to show, only to be disappointed when they turned up an\nhour late. Conditions left a lot to be\ndesired with winds of at least one\nhundred km/h but IC played solidly\nin defence with some crunching\nfouls from Psycho. It was nil-nil at\nhalf time, when we were delighted to\nsee our short strider/defender/keeper\n/boxer in the lovely red jacket, Tony.\nThis put the fear of God into UCL,\nforcing them to score a superb own\ngoal. This was followed by a shotgun\nright foot from Dave, making up for\nhis earlier one-on-one cock-up with\nthe notorious UCL keeper. In\nremarkable conditions (Dicks play-ing, Jules and Tony on the pitch at\nfull time, Chris Parsons in one piece\nand flashbacks of the '87 storms).\nSo, another win for the firsts - no\nthanks to Donal who was shit.\nICFC I20 UCL I Fourths seconds away from\nblowing seconds away\nWith a free date in their busy s ched ule, IC II kindly agreed to play us,\nthe fourths, in a friendly. The match\nwas delayed while the less proud\nmembers of the fourths clam me red to get their autographs. When it got\nunderway, it was clear that it was\ngoing to be the proverbial game of\ntwo halves, since the wind was so\nstrong. Goal kicks barely reached the\nhalf-way line against the wind and\nwith it reached the other penalty box.\nBut it was not so; after winning the\ntoss the underdog fourths raced into a deserved three-nil half-time lead.\nMorgan scored with a\"f*c king glorious\" opening goal, again with a classy finish and completed his hattrick on the stroke of half-time.\nThe story read quite differently\nafter the restart, with the seconds\nshowing a bit of the class that we had\ndone well to stifle this long. We held\nout until fifteen minutes before the\nend when a clever short corner totally outwitted our defence and their\ncaptain planted a glorious header in\nthe back of our net. Minutes later our\n'keeper was to blame - a punt upfield\nlanded in the box and bounced right\nover the advancing Stu and into the\nnet. As the end of the match drew\nnearer the seconds became more and\nmore desperate as they looked to be\ncompletely humbled. It was not to\nbe, though, as in the dying seconds\ntheir little striker nipped in to head in\nthe equalise r. In the end the wind was\nthe winner, Brian.\nICFC II 3 - 3 ICFC IV\n\n"

In the\nfirst day's singles tournament Alex,\nJon and Vay all reached the last six-teen, but back problems forced Alex\nto pull out and posed a worry for the\nteam event.. Vay narrowly lost his\nmatch, but Jon kept Imperial's flag\ncruised through their first group\nstage; winning against Trinity\nCollege Carmarthen (8 - 0), Hull (7 -1) and Southampton (7-1). In the\nnext phase they again found the\ngoing easy with wins over Hull (7-1,\nagain) and highly fancied UEA(62). By the next day Alex had recovered sufficiently to win a vital match\nto beat hosts Warwick 6 - 3 in the\nflying with two more wins before\nlosing in the semi-final to the eventual champion from UEA. In the Bteam singles competition, Phil and\nAsif both progressed to the last six-teen, at which point Phil beat Asif,\nand with two further wins reached\nthe final. Some fine all-round play\nfrom Phil Davies overwhelmed his\nWarwick opponent to be crowned\nNational Champion.\nIn the B team event, wins over\nBristol (7 - 3) and Southampton (6 -4) were not quite enough after a loss\nagainst Queen's Belfast (2 - 8) to\nallow IC to progress to the last four,\ncutting short a promising campaign\nfor the team of Phil Davies, Russel\nTowers, Tim Dann, Kevin Camadoo\nand Asif Kassam. For the A team the\nloss of Alex for the first day's competition was overcome as they\nquarter-final. Next, Queen's provided a sterner test, but 2 - 0 wins by\nSimon and Vay and a final frame win\nby Alex put Imperial into their first\never final. Here, against Bristol they\nbegan well with a win by Vay over\ntheir No. 1 and a20 win by Simon.\nThis left Imperial almost home and\nneeding one more match for victory.\nThis turned into a race between\nSpike and Jon to be first to win their\nmatch, with Jon eventually pipping\nSpike to clinch the title for Imperial.\nThus, Imperial's A team of Simon\nBaugh, Alex Robinson, Jon Fulcher,\nVay Ly and Spike Milligan were\ncrowned National Team Champions\nfor the first time. The A team win,\ncombined with Phil'sB team singles triumph made Imperial the most\nsuccessful University team at the\nChampionships.\nFluffy fledglings fly far\nLast weekend the IC Novice Squad\nraced at the Hammersmith Double\nHeader. The course was from\nChiswich to Hammersmith, and\ndespite some rough and windy conditions all our crews performed very\nwell, the men's novice A crew won\ntheir category by a minute and a half\nand obtained an impressive second\nplace overall. This was backed up by\nthe men'sB crew who came second\nin their category, and seventh in the\nwhole race. The women's novice\neight also raced and won their cate-gory, beating a Thames Tradesman\ncrew and finishing fifteenth overall.\nA very impressive set of results for\nthe novices.\nRunners and riders rule relay\nIn an unprecedented amalgamation\nof the cross-country and cycling\nclubs, Gaffer (Demetrius) and\nTazman (Tarik) took part in the infamous Evans Ghoulie Grind du athlon on Sunday. Waking up at five in the\nmorning and forsaking their usual\nfine, hale and hearty breakfasts, the\ntwo athletes headed for Guildford in\ntheir souped-up yellow Fiesta, finding their way to the race by means of\ntailing a car with bikes on the back of\nit.\nWhen the race began, Gaffer shot\noff to an early start, going on to tackle the three mile cross-country run\nand only lost a few places. With an\nalmost instantaneous change-over,\nTazman hurtled down the first decent\nof the twelve and a half mile bike\nride. However, soon the going got\ntough with the 1:7 climbs which give\nthe race its name. After a storming\nand lung-busting ride, it was Gaffer's turn again to run the remaining two\nand a half miles of this gut-wrench-ing event. After a well deserved\nbreakfast, the results came through\nand positioned the \"IC Crew\" as the\n2nd relay team. With this encouraging performance the team aim to take\nthe event by the balls next year.\nHull of a bad time for rugby lads\nAfter a marathon five hour journey\nwe reached Hull, which put the team\noff, except maybe Alasdair who\nfound the Humber Bridge \"exciting.\"\nAfter 45 minutes of traipsing through\nthe most dismal town in the North,\nwe eventually found the pitch thanks\nto Tom's unerring direction sense.\nThe pitch was as muddy and undulating as the rest of Humberside.\nFrom the kick-off our forwards\nshowed their power and we camped\nin their territory until half-time, by\nwhich point we were leading 8 - 5\nthanks to a try from Alasdair and a penalty from Paul. We were unlucky\nnot be further ahead, with a try d is al lowed.\nAfter finding that Northerners\ncould not afford oranges or water at\nhalf-time [Oi watch it, Sports Ed.],\nwe turned around to face what had\nsuddenly become a very strong head-wind. Disheartened that even the elements were against us, we started to\nlose our poise. Humberside took\nadvantage and not even our strong\nrunning could save the match, denying us a place in the quarter-finals.\nRetiring to the changing rooms (\nwhich incidentally were un lit), we\nwere intrigued by the fact that in\nHull, the women's rugby team use\nthe men's showers. Unimpressed\nwith the Hull RFC facilities we\nrejoined our storming coach drivers\nfor the journey back to the Union.\nWe apologise to Capital Coaches for\nwhat Gudmund did to the toilet.\nICRFC in vs Humberside RFC m RESULTS MEN'S FOOTBALL\nIC I20LSE I IC IV 6 - 1 UMD S II\nIC IV 4 - 2 LSE V IC V50 BIR BECK( walkover)\nWOMEN'S HOCKEY\nIC II 2 - 2\nMEN'S HOCKEY\nIC I03Q MW I IC III 1 - 3 Royal Holloway\nRS Mv s CAMBOURNE SM Football 2 - 0\nMen's Hockey 1-1\nWomen's hockey 0 - 3\nRugby 1 8 - 5\nSquash 2 - 3\nFull report next week...\n\n"

Felix & IC Radio put the\nquestions to them, so here are the\nresults...\nTo hear the full interviews, tune into IC Radio on 999AM this\nevening at 6pm. By Mark Baker and Chris Earls\nFelix Editor\nJeremy Thomson\nQuestioned initially as to why he is standing for Felix Editor, Jeremy\nsuggested that he is \"the best person to do it, from the experience\npoint of view.\" He stressed that he has been involved with Felix\nthroughout his three years at IC and therefore knows \"all the background to it.\" In addition to his experience Jeremy emphasised that\nwith so many major issues due to be discussed in the coming year he\nis \"someone who isn't afraid to mince their words.\"\nDiscussing this year's News pages and how he wishes to change\nthem, Jeremy accepted that there may have be too much London\nnews saying \"It's very important that any news that's not in IC is\ndirectly relevant to students.\" He went on to say that while news of\nIC research may be important it must be realised that Felix \"is not a College newspaper it's the student's newspaper.\"\nAs to the expression of political views in Felix, Jeremy insisted that\nalthough he has his own opinions, \"it's not up to me to make Felix\nmy political mouthpiece.\" He further expressed his wish to reunite\nthe current two sections of Felix into a single A4 publication, insisting\n\"We can get a lot more done, in the time, effort and money avail-able.\"\nWith his extensive experience on the production and writing side of\nFelix, Jeremy was asked whether he felt that there are any areas\nwhere he needs training. He responded by conceding that most of the\nfinance side would be new to him and that \"I don't have much experience in advertising.\"\nDP (Clubs & Societies)\nSarah Thomas\nApart from her experience in City & Guilds and ICU hockey, Sarah\nadmitted that she has not been involved in other clubs and societies\nbut suggested that this was hot a problem. She highlighted her dual\nperspective both from an individual club member and from the organisation level as C&G President. With this and her current role as ICU\nCouncil Chair in mind she denied suggestions that she might be\nregarded as a hack, but pointed out that her experience has enabled\nher to \"pick out the way things have been done wrongly in the past\".\nWith communication featuring in both manifestoes Sarah suggested\nthat she would like to see joint events between medics and those on\nthe South Kensington campus to alleviate the current \"animosity\".\nShe emphasised the Mary's involvement in the rugby club tours but\nhad difficulty suggesting what other type of joint events she en vis aged. She denied that \"ov cia p ping\" clubs and societies should be\nforced to merged but that people should be encouraged to communicate and \"let them make their decisions.\"\nAs Council Chair Sarah suggested that it was difficult for her to say\nwhat she would have done differently to the current sabbatical team\nwith regard to the bookstore tender but did say that \"in retrospect\nmaybe it should have been publicised a little more beforehand.\". She\nsaid that \"however much protesting we do it's not going to change,\nwe have to accept the fact that we can't get it back.\"\nEncouraging students to vote for her, Sarah said that her experience would enable her to \"change the things that don't work and continue the things that do.\"\nSmita Chaturvedi\nWith her limited experience in hockey and ACC, Samita denied that\nshe did not have enough experience to do the job, and suggested that\nwhatever she did not know at the start she would be able to pick up\nat the start of her sabbatical year. Samita accepted that the only direct\nexperience she has of clubs, other than hockey, is of the Indian\nSociety and being involved with \"a few of the sports societies\". She\ndenied suggestions that she might favour sports clubs saying that\n\"because they [arts societies] are so small I'd like to bring them out\nand promote them.\"\nWith regard to communication Samita suggested that joint social\nevents would be a way to break down the existing rivalry between\nSouth Kensington and medical students. Samita agreed with her rival\ncandidate that any mergers should not be forced saying \"I really do\nthink it's their decision\". She did however admit that this might be to\nthe detriment of the overall student body commenting that \"Yeah\nmaybe it will be a bit of a disadvantage\", but denied that her position\nwas due to electoral expedience.\nWith regard to the recent loss of the academic bookstore, Samita\nfelt unable to offer an opinion on how the tender should have been\nhandled differently. \"I wasn't there, I'm not on Council or anything\"\nshe said before adding that \"as far as I can see I wouldn't have\nchanged much.\"\nQuestioned as to why students should vote for her she replied that\n\"I'm very enthusiastic to do the job, I 've got the energy and determination to do it well and would like to do it well.\"\nDP (Finance & Services)\nDuncan Tindall\nDuncan revealed that he decided to stand a few weeks before papers\nwent up because \"it just seemed the right thing to do\". He picked out\ncommunication as being an important issue, stating that as soon as\nsabbaticals are elected, the 50 students on council \"are the only people that they see\". He suggested that the new Clubs and Societies\n\n"

For example France and Germany,\nwhose economies are thriving. There is no\nreason why Britain should not do the same.\nThe royals are paid monstrous amounts to\nact as upstanding citizens and yet this model\nfamily is awash with adultery, divorce and\ntreachery. In short, if they wish to lead the\nsordid lives of their 'normal' subjects then\nthey should be willing to receive the complementary pay cuts that their loyal subjects;\nnurses, doctors, teachers, university lecturers\nand all manner of public servants are continually having to endure. There is an alarming\ndecline in funding for our Great Nation's education, NHS and military and yet insane\namounts of money are being given to one\nfamily so they can gal avant across the globe,\nski holidays, and Caribbean trips, thousands\nto lavish on designer clothing, not to mention\nthe huge number of servants that they\nemploy. It is absolutely ludicrous that illiteracy levels in Britain are among the highest in\nthe developed world, that the queues on NHS\nwaiting lists are insurmountable, that class\nsizes are ridiculously large and yet it is possible that \u00a360 million in a royal\nyacht. Will you benefit from a royal yacht?\nSome pro-royalists may argue that the\nRoyal family brings in tourist revenue, yet\ntoday this is a la;.. .\u2022\u2022.-/. London\nthrives on it's unique culture and cosmopolitan atmosphere.\nIn addition, the monarchy perpetuates the\nsurvival of the notorious British class system\nwhich impedes the competitive viability of\nBritain as well as violating all humanitarian\ncodes of conduct. In fact the monarchy is a symbol of upper class tyranny. One may\nargue that the monarchy is a diplomatic aid\nand a symbol of neutrality but the following\nstatements made by the monarchy in recent\nyears profess otherwise.\nIn reaction to the ban on handguns due to\nthe horrific Dunblane affair one member of\nthe monarchy, who shall remain unnamed,\ninsisted that any actions to ban them were\ninappropriate, his reasoning, \"If someone\nwith a cricket bat went into a primary school\nand murdered children one would not suddenly seek to ban cricket bats.\" In Dunblane\n16 children, all under six, and their school\nteacher were murdered.\nOn a diplomatic visit to Hong-Kong this\nsame member decided to offer derogatory\ncomments about the population and its \"slit ty eyes\", among other things.\nOverall, the monarchy is impeding the\nBritish economy, their only positive contribution is in the sale of newspapers, where we\nare informed daily of the sexual deviance s of\nour su cee ding King.\nIn conclusion, the concept of an inherited\nhead of state, along with its entourage of various dukes, lords and squires is archaic and\nreprehensible. Britain should bravely enter\nthe age of the millenium and abolish the\nmonarchy.\nIfto S if c lift\n1\n%\nI66%32% Ib56%42%40%3iS FELIX FRIDAY28 TH FEBRUARY MONARCHY 9\nru fe over us?\na prime minister, fast use5 in r] er name by th> 6o\\>e rno r'6ene raf of Xustrafta. Is it rig fy t tr]at\n0rime TDinister, or is it an important 6a fan cene c ces saro for t( je way our country is run?\nCan you imagine it: The People's Republic\nof Britain? Oliver Cromwell called it the\nCommonwealth of England. There is little\ndoubt that there is a lot wrong with the whole\nhereditary principle: the vast majority of the\ncountry, including a substantial number of\nleft-wing Tory MPs believe in constitutional\nreform of the Lords, but the mainstream\npolitical parties all want the Queen to stay.\nWhy?\nBritain's constitution consists of a variety\nof documents, including the Magna Carta,\nThe 1688 Bill of Rights, and common law\nand statute law. Claire Rayner said on the\ninfamous and inarticulate Carlton debate that\nBritain needs a written constitution and elected House of Lords and no more monarchy. I can imagine nothing more boring and clinical\nthan an off-the-shelf constitution and a President. We have an institution that has\nserved us for over a thousand years, it is\nfamous throughout the world (when someone\nsays \"The Queen' they nearly always mean\nthe British Queen) and brings in untold\ninvestment in the form of tourism and trade\nfairs on the Royal Yacht (estimated to be billions of pounds a year). The cost of this\nBritish icon is minute in comparison with the\nfinancial benefits we receive. .\nThe monarch is a symbol of continuity, rising above politics. Her immense experience\nof constitutional affairs allows her to advise\nher Prime Ministers at their weekly meetings,\nsomething which ex-Prime Ministers of aj\u00a7l political parties said ths dated;..,\nMonarchs . \u2022\n.\n\u2022 sens B live i'I their political neutrality, and their role\nas head of state takes much of the pressure\noff the serving Prime Minister. Many\nobservers say that the role and glamour of our\nmonarch should be reduced to that of\nScandinavian countries (a bicycling monarchy), but it is worth remembering that our\nQueen represents a country with a population\ngreater than that of the monarchies of\nNorway, Sweden, Finland, Holland,\nDenmark and Belgium combined - why\nshouldn't they be more glamorous?\nThe Way Forward Group consists of the\nQueen, her immediate family, plus a few constitutional experts. They are always looking\nfor ways to prepare the monarchy for the 21st century, including primogeniture (the firstborn child inheriting rather than the first-born\nson), reducing the Civil List, reducing freebies and glamorous trips, paying tax, doing\nmore charity work, improving Britain's image abroad (who would a foreign country\nrather have - Her Majesty or John Major?).\nMany of these changes have been implemented, and more are in the pipeline.\nMany people argue that the behaviour of\nthe Royal Family has; shown that they are not\nfit to govern us. Th&Jjress love nothing more\nthan a story that q j jpl p nes royals and sex.\nThe behaviour of past royals was appalling in\ncomparison with the present and of elected\npoliticians, and the public is not exactly\n'Ihebatlleisnotalioutthel d behaviour of\n.i particular member (do note the Queen's jj jer nui our has always been impeccable) but\nlie institution as a whole.
