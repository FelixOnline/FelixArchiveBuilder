    "content": "Industrial\nI begin this week by gnashing my teeth about\nthe disappearance of posters from along the\nwalkway; this happened between 9:30 and\n12:30 of a morning which is exceeding na ff. We\nhave heard that other societies lose theirs\nmore regularly\u2014perhaps there is a Blu-Tack\nfetishists around!\nMonday's talk was another monster event\u2014many thanks to the chosen(?) few who\ncame along and a big WHY NOT? to those\nwho didn't.Our next opus is the visit to Fords at\nDagenham \u2014 pci ket lines permitting. All t rippers meet at Beit Arch at 12:45pm. Finally, many thanks to our new deputy\nofficers who make the committee's job easier!\nWins Tsun\nA division of Simon Lau's Martial Arts Academcy of Wing Tsun Kung Fu was formed\nrecently at Imperial College. Wing Tsun is an\nart which does not emphasise a clash of force\nwith force, but on the clever use of one's force\nso as to overcome the force of one's opponent, with fast and deadly moves.\nWe are having our first social event on\nSaturday, December 12 at 6:30pm at IC. We\nhave lined up a programme with variety,\nconsisting of a demonstration of the art by\nMaster Lau and students. (Master Lau is the\nrepresentative who sits on the technical committee of British Kung Fu Council.) The\nprogramme also includes a raffle, party games,\nmusic, food and drinks.\nIn the meantime if you want to find out more\nabout the art or party, please feel free to\ncontact the following persons: Benny Notartanni Phys 3, Wing Lai Phys 3, Sandeep\nCiv Eng 3, or come along to our session at the\nUnion Gym on Wednesday or Saturday between 3:00 and 6:00 and 11:00 and 2:00\nrespectively.\nSnooker\nIn one of the most rivetting, exciting matches\n'the snooker lounge has seen for years, the C team beat the A team. Things started well for\nTripp's boys (A team) when Calvert beat\nHurford, but when Lawrence potted everything in sight to beat a stunned Thomason to\nmake it 1-1, it became obvious that things\nweren't going the way Tripp planned. The next\nmatch was a real nail-biter, culminating in\nAndy \"It was a bit embarrassing, really\" Krussewki slamming in the pink and black\nagainst President White who registered his\ndisgust by trying to make a whole in the floor\nwith his cue. It was now 2-1 to the C team, so it\nwas left ot N. Gaskill Esq. to save his side from\na fate worse than death. He was up against C team Capt Jennings, who had just got back\nfrom the loo in time. In a match of nervous\ntension filled s no oo ker, Gaskill edged ahead\nand when he potted the pink the immortal\nwords were uttered \"I have won, haven'tI?\" But no! He was wrong! A miscalculation from a maths student! And in a few shots time he was\nheard to describe the events as \"the worst day\nin my life\" as Jennnings potted the black to\nensure victory for his team. An irate trip then\nproceeded to crucify Paul \"I think that went as\nexpected\" Holt, to make the final score 3-2.\nAmid all this mayhem, the B team stormed\nto the top of the league by taking out L SEA team 3-2. The foundations were laid by Ward\nand an excellent show of controlled aggression\nby Simpkin, leaving the captain to finish it off\n(just) in the final frame.\nJ RESULTS Wednesday, November11 Football IC I vs Chelsea College I51(H)I CIV vs Goldsmiths Ml 7-3(A) IC Y vs Royal Holloway III 2-2(A) Rugby IC II vs Rocha mp tc I5-(i( A) Rugby\nSeconds\nOn Wednesday the second XV went via\nLondon Transport into deepest Roehampton\nfor a match against Roehampton Institute.\nThe team was, as always, beset by many\nproblems, but most of these were sorted out\nin the somewhat unusual changing rooms, as\na certain second row moaned his way to\nprop!\nThe game itself was dictated mainly by\nIbrward play, as the width of the pitch left a great deal to be desired lor the backs, and\nhence some heavy ruc king and mauling took\nplace, leading to the occasional case of over\nenthusiasm. The new found kicking ability of\nM Winsor, aided by the less than expansive\npitch, put us 6-3 up at hall-time, i.e. two\npenalties to one.\nThe game continued in much the same\nvein in the second hall with much good\nforward play, 'fli c other points of the match\ncame from another penalty, and a fortunate\nbreakaway try from N. Brummell, which was\nalso converted, leaving the final score at 15-0\nto Imperial.\nOnce again it was good to see the team\nspirit and enthusiasm overcoming the\nconsiderable reorganisation problems, especially in the pack on this forwards' day.\nTeam: A. Math, R. Frith, M. Winsor, .V. Brumtnel, R. Flynn, Al. Simmons, J. Paixdo, S. Bell, C. Cole, T. Can, C. Henderson, A. Ralph, J. Austin, II'. Aston, J. Weir.\nBowling\nA lull team turned up for the first match of\nthe season at Heathrow Bowl against Brunei\nUniversity. Bowling started at 12:00 noon\nand continued throughout the afternoon\nuntil 3:00-3:30p m.OurA team had the\nclosest ol all the matches narrowly losing the\nfirst game by Hi pins, losing the second game\nbut winning the third, thanks mainly to the\npersonal effort by Andy Mc Mullen who\nscored 200+ and good team backing from the\nrest ol the A players.\nB,('. and the ladies teams were convincingly-beaten although the B team clinched one\nfinal game in their match. The overall score\nwas 2-14.\nFootball\nFirsts\nDear Mummy STOP Found Daddy?

Rigby notched an accurately placed\nsecond soon alter.\nA counter-attack led to a line solo goal by\nDave Hardy and the first half scoring was\ncompleted by Rich Dolan when his long\nrange drive went through a crowd ol players.\nGoldsmiths restarted frantically and scored\nfollowing a corner, but the defence stood up\nwell to further pressure, with Dave Kindred outstanding.\nAndy McMahon's goal after a free kick\nstopped any slight chance of Goldsmiths\nrecovery and the job was finished with a well-taken goal by Rich Heath.\nTeam: Slater. Maddy, Kindred, David, Heath,\nMcMahon, Hardy, Dolan, Gladman, Ri^by,\nMe. Yieliolas.\nX Country\nOn Wednesday, November 11, the second\nrace in the University of London League took\npl act at Uxbridge. The course was over 2.3\nmiles of quite firm ground (except for the\noccasional deep ditch and muddy puddle),\nthe men doing two laps and the women one.\nWith the ladies team out in full force (all\nthree of us!), Sarah Pearson and Carolyn Walton battled it out at the finish to come\nseventeenth and eighteenth (Carolyn should\nhave pipped Sarah to the post, but confusion\nas to where the finish actually was reversed\nthe result).\nA few moments later Nicola Baker came\nin, a good thirtieth. Tasso Asteriades came\neighth in the mens race and other creditable\nperformances came from Jonathan Frost,\nSteve Taylor, Russel, Mike Jones. Thanks to\neveryone who turned up making a great team\nspirit, and to Steve Rim mer, who gave up his\nspare time to make a guest appearance. We\nall missed the presence of our captain, Pete,\nhowever, who was having treatment on his\ninjured knee at the time. Lets hope he'll be\nracing again soon.\nPage 10 FELIX, November 20, 1981\n\n"

Last Saturday, I was asked by Steve Higgins( who is arranging the event)\nwhether I could provide the\nmoney so that the beer could be obtained that afternoon.\nVery foolishly, I offered two\ncheques out of my own account for \u00a3 5 6 0 .

Wells film on Monday as part of the RCS Centenary celebrations.\nThe Man Who Could Work Miracles is\nabout what happens when the Giver of Power\nis tempted into giving an earthling the power of\nunlimited miracle working. This, of course,\nleads to disaster o us consequences, with\ninfinite power corrupting infinitely with one or\ntwo interesting chronologically out of joint\nsituations on the way.\nThe film was made in 1937 and (like Things\nto Come) was scripted by H.G. Wells himself.\nAlexander Korda directed this classic which is\nbest remembered for the cinematic effects\n(which are by no means too old hat for more\nsophisticated audiences of today) and Ralph\nRichardson's marvellous portrayal of Colonel\nWinstanly.\nThe Man who Could Work Miracles will be\nshown on Monday, November 23 at 6:30pm in\nMech Eng 220.\nYacht\nLast weekend's sailing was one of the most\neventful yet. Eleven sailors and two captains\nmanned two yachts, Quinta and Churchill,\nboth berthed at Lymington. The weather\nforecast predicted fair winds so we were\ndetermined to get out of the Solent.\nSaturday saw us drifting slowly from Lymington to Studland Bay (near Poole) via\nthe Needles. Quinta did some nifty spinnaker\nwork and made fair progress but Churchill's skipper took things more geriatric ally. At Studland, Quinta's captain showed he was a land luv ver by steaming his yacht aground. The\nevening's entertainment was mainly alcoholic\nbut there were also some jolly japes with\ndinghies and buckets of water.\nSunday brought near perfect sailing weather\nso at 6:40am we set off to go round the Isle of\nWight before returning to Lymington. Quinta's captain, tempting fate, kept close to the island\nall the way and sure enough they went\naground while doing 71\n/2 knots with spinnaker\nup. Both yachts got back to base at about\n3:30pm. So if you like the idea of yachting\u2014offshore\nor on shore (we have skippers which cater for\nall tastes) why not come to meeting, 12:30pm Thursdays in Botany Common Room (under\nBeit Arch).\nSF Soc\nHere we are again. Oh God. What have I got\nto talk about this week. Ah yes. Barrington J. Bayley is coming to talk to us, on Thrusday,\nNovember26 at 1 : 0 0 pm in the Green Committee Room. Nice blok e, Barry. First\ntime I met him he bought an NME2. Written\nsome good stuff, too. I like \"Soul of a Robot\"\nbest, but others prefer \"Full of Chronopolis\".\nStill, anyone who can reply to \" Hi,I' m Phillip\"\nwith \" Hi,I' m pissed\" can't be bad.\nRe '200T Ents Quote: \"sorry 'bout the\nsound, but overseas bugger ed the amp.\" The\nmind boggles.\nYou might like to know what the people who\nwere at last week's meeting chose as films for\nnext term.

Items to be considered will\nbe the forthcoming visit of Stuart Mole, party\ncandidate for Chelmsford and political assistant to David Steel; and the production\nand articles for the next edition of 'Forward'. If\nyou have a complaint about ICU, government\ncuts, party politics, or can compile a crossword, draw cartoons and basically have a lot of talent, then come along. Forward is a voice independent of the sabbaticals, so let's have your views. By the way, next year\nsometime we hope to be holding a meeting in\ncon jun c it on with SDP Soc at which David\nSteel will be speaking.\nAnti-Apartheid\nIn South Africa the white minority (one in four\nor less) deprive black people of basic human\nand democratic rights\u2014the right to freedom of\nspeech and movement; the right to education,\nhousing and health; the right to vote. The\nsystem of Apartheid( meaning \"separate\ndevelopment\") is supposedly designed to\nenable various cultural and ethnic groups to\nremain distinct and self-governing. In reality it\nis the means by which the whites divide and\nrule. The blacks' shanty towns are bulldozed\nto the ground, and the blacks themselves are\nforced into infertile \"homelands\" whether they\nwant to go \"home\" or not.\nSouth Africa's economy l are gly depends\nupon the exploitation of mineral resources\n(such as gold, diamonds and uranium from\nNamibia) and to achieve this as economically\nas possible the white South Africans depend\non the exploitation of cheap, black, frequently\nmigrant labour. Thus it is in the government's interest to perpetuate institutional is ed racism,\nwhatever they may say about their good intentions.\nImperial College Anti-Apartheid Group was\nre-formed last Friday. On Friday, November\n20 (lunchtime today) there will be a speaker\nmeeting in the Union Building. Next week\nthere'll be a display in the Junior Common Room for two days or more. In the near future\nwe'll be concerned with the unresolved issue of\nSouth African government sponsored students on nuclear technology courses at\nImperial College.\nAstrosoc\nAfter a brief respite last week, Astrosoc has\nnow bounced back with a very full programme\nof events for the last few eek s of term. First\nand foremost, there is the EG M on Monday,\nNovember 23 at 5:30pm in LT2, when this\nyear's committee will be elected. You still have\nuntil Friday evening to put your name forward\nas a candidate (don't forget the proposer and\ntwo second ers as well) and even if you don't want to be a committee member, please come\nand take part in the voting.\nThe following day we resume our regular\nlecture programme with Prof Kibble of the\nTheoretical Physics Group speaking on\nsomething cosmological (coffee and biscuits\nafterwards). Then on the Wednesday, we have\nthe first of what we hope will be regular\nobserving meetings. This will be at 2:00pm in\nthe \"Wave-guide\" in Physics (Level 1). We\nhope to start work on 6\" and 8\" refractor s, to\nenable serious observing to start before the\nend of this term, and also to discuss the\nsubject matter of a proposed three-lecture\n\"course\" on practical observing techniques.\nSo at last Astros oc has provided an alternative to lectures for those members\ninterested in watching the sky (or should I say\nthe clouds, in this climate?!), but don't let that\nstop you coming to lectures as well if you want!\nEnts\nThis is the first of a series from the new\nimproved Ents. In our roles of providing films,\ndiscos and bands we're off to a cracking start\nwith One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\n(concluding Rag Week). As usual with our\nThursday films, it is in Me ch Eng 220 at 6:30pm( only 50p!). Also book a date in your diary for\nthe Ents \" Almost Christmas Party\" with\n\"Bumble and the Beez\", disco and bar on\nDecember 4 in the J CR.

    "content": "Mines Open\nDay\nCareful inspection of the Small Ads column in\nFELIX would have forewarned diligent readers\nof the advent of our second annual open day\nlast Monday.\nHow does one measure the \"success\" of\nsuch an event; attendance, interest, number of\nexhibitors, standard of exhibition, organisation\nor whether interviewees claim that the day\nturned them onto a course at RS M.I claim that\nthe \"success\" is a combination of all of these\nand that individuals should take their own\nopinion:\n477 'junior students' attended representing\n88 schools with 39 teachers in attendance. We actually invited 465 schools and got replies\nfrom about 120. The deficit of 345 is worth\nnoting\u2014especially in the present economic\nclimate. Maybe school principals place more\nimportance on ll'/2 P on postage than a potential degree with subsequent career.\nInterest value is directly proportional to the\ninterest of the person being exhibited to. In our\ninvitation we offered five places to each school\nwith the intent of precluding 6th form outings.\nOne school brought 16 students, all of whom\nhe claimed were interested. Exhibition staff are\nthe best to judge the actual interest and I quote: \"I was surprised to note that rather\nthan having eight people gazing into space and\none person paying attention your Open Day\nwas the reverse of this.\" (Min Proc stand);\n8:30pm I arrive at the congregational area\nbeside Chemistry amid much activity; John\nVedy, Motor Club Captain, tells me that\nthey have a full complement of twelve cars\n(all their rally licence allows) and that the\nweather looks set for a good night's driving. I meet some of the marshall s, who keep track\nall the competitors' cars and time them\nthrough the various sections of the route.\nThey keep in touch with each other by a licenced radio amateur in each of the ten\nmarshall's cars (not CB). The competitors\ncars are scrutinised to make sure that they're\nfit for the hard driving they'll receive and one\nby one they make for the start in the heart of\nKent, in fact Toys Hill, the highest point of the\ncounty. I join the rally organiser, and we\nmake our way there as well.\n10:45pm the quiet of a National Trust car\npark is disturbed by 22 cars preparing for the\ntrip.\n11:15pm I leave in the course opening car,\nwhich goes round the route ahead of all the\ncompetitors, checking the road, and putting\npassage control (PC) boards by the side of\nthe road, each with a symbol on it which the\ncompetitors have to note down to prove that\nthey did traverse the correct route. We meet\nthe first (stationary) marshall's car, and give\nthem their instructions.\n11:25pm The alternator in our Escort\nappears to pack up\u2014leaving the headlights,\nradio and engine to run down the battery. The\ncar stalls a couple of times and muscle power \"\ngets it going again, but no one knows how\nlong the battery will last.\n12:00am Half-way through the first section\n(of two) and we're getting rather paranoid\nabout our battery, which seems to be nearing\nits limit. The leading competitor's car is only\n\"There does seem to be a genuine interest\nfrom the majority of people attending.\" (BP\nstand) And one from a student: \"I wish I had\nbeen able to see this exhibition before I chose\nmy A Levels\"\u2014therein lies a problem.\nWe had 34 exhibitions overall, of which 16\nwere supplied by companies. All the\nexhibitions high quality and interest value and\nall reflected the diligence of the exhibitor to\nportray their field to its best. One representative from a mining company did, however,\nthink that his company should buck its ideas\nup a bit\u2014I had to agree!\nExperience from last year showed that you\nhave to split students in to groups and guide\nthem around. A Laissez-faire system does not\nwork at all. We used coordinators on each\nfloor and is the muster room and this appeared\nto work reasonably well although, at the peak\nhour (11:00-12:00) we did have a little bit of\ntrouble coordinating effectively. Guides showed their group around his/her respective\ndepartment and then returned the group to\nthe muster room\u2014This system appeared to\nwork well.\nAs for whether our Open Day will convince\nprospective students to come to the RS M to\ndo a course is not, I believe, a matter of\nsignificance. If we have managed to impart\ninformation to careers teachers\u2014who are\nremarkably ill informed about Mineral Resources Engineering \u2014 then we have succeeded.\nFinally, 1 must thank the people who worked\nextremely well to make the day work. It would\nbe unfair to name a few as it might belittle\nthose who did a small but vital function at the\nright time.\nCM. Sleap\nOpen Day Committee Chairman\nseven minutes behind us (too close for\ncomfort\u2014there's meant to be about a half-hour gap).\n1 2 : 1 5 am For no apparent reason the\nalternator starts working again, and we heave\nsighs of relief.\n12:30am We hear over the radio that two of\nthe cars seem to have got lost\u2014some of the\nnavigation clues can be quite cryptic.\n12:55 We plant aPC board on one of the\ntwo long legs of a triangle\u2014any rally cars\nwho try to save time by cutting off that\nsection will miss it and lose points.\n01:35 The two errant cars have found the\nroute again, but a navigator in another car is\nrather the worse for wear, and so they retire\nbefore he throws up his supper. We have\nmade up some time and are well ahead of the\nlead car.\n01:45am Arrive at half-way point\u2014a chance\nto have a rest and some thermos coffee.\n02:15am Off again, to more high-speed\ndriving through narrow country lanes, giving\ninstructions to the marshall s along the route,\nand feeling the effect of lack of sleep as the\ndriver and navigator survive on caffeine\ntablets.\n03:55am We 'plant' the last PC board and race\nfor the finish at an even higher speed than our\nusual hair-raising pace.\n4:10am The first competitors arrive at the\nfinish and the task of adding up all the marks\nbegins. It seems that there had been no\naccidents and no-one got totally lost on the\nrally.\n04:45 The provisional results are announced, the winners being Kift and Gaylor.\n05:10 Head back to College and a very\nwelcome bed, reached just as dawn broke.\nJasper\nCentenary Ball\nTickets\nI am still quite willing to accept\ncheques for the \"Ball of the\nCentury\"\u2014but time is running\nout.\nIf you want to go, you need a ticket. These will be distributed\nnext week. If anyone has not yet\nreceived a receipt, please let me\nknow immediately in case your\ncheque has not reached me.\nCheques may be sent to me\nthrough the internal mail. Alternatively, I will be in the RCSU\nOffice (above Southside Shop)\non Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday lunchtime. After Wednesday (Nov 25) lunchtime, no\nmore tickets will be sold.\nYes, you've got it\u2014this is an\nultimatum.\nAndrew North\nHon Secretary\nRCS Union\nPS: No Riff Raff.\nIt must be quite a comedown for musicians\nwho've played Hammersmith Odeon and been\ninvolved in the first satellite broadcast of a rock concert to play to a crowd not reaching\nthree figures.\nThe reason for the poor crowd was\ninsufficient publicity which resulted from a misunderstanding between Ents and IC Rag\nCommittee.\nHowever the concert did not lose money,\nbut this should not ease the conscience of\nthose who couldn't be bothered to attend. It\nonly cost \u00a31.\nAs for the music, the band played a loud, if\nrestrained, mixture of 'heavy' rock with liberal\ninclusion of tapes and various other effects.\nThey sounded best when playing progressive\nchord sequences and although their hearts are\nin the right place lyrically (singing about\nunequal distribution of wealth\u2014Third World\nBriefcases) it was difficult to hear the vocals\nclearly. Best numbers included Dancing Days\nand Clone on the Phone which along with\n'cleaning up' of other material could form the\nbasis of an impressive debut album.\nDriving force in the band is Zal Cleminson\n(guitar, vocals and writer of all the songs) who\nfounded the band with Barriemore Barlow\n(drums). Other members are Charlie Tumahi\n(bass) and Ron Leaky (keyboards).\nSupport was Jon Benns whose songs about\nsubjects close to IC students' hears went down\nwell.\nFinally, although Tandoori Cassette's show\nallowed little improvisation( opening and\nclosing with a tape) it was highly insensitive\nand ignorant of someone to play a record over\naPA without giving the band the opportunity\nto earn an encore.\nGuilds Motor Rally\nAn outsider's view\nPage 6 FELIX, November 20, 1981\n\n"

At the time of writing I'm not sure whether it'll be\ni ate Friday or Monday morning\u2014I apologise\nfor any delay, but it is due to circumstances\nbeyond my control. I can assure you that my\ndisappointment will be greater than yours.\nRoyal College of Science Centenary\nOh well, I cannot remain silent. It would be a wild exaggeration to assert that the events so\nfar have been a great success. Some of the\nblame must be aimed at the RCS Union, who\n(despite having a fortnight's worth of events\nhanded to them on a plate) have not generated\nthe necessary enthusiasm for the celebration.\nBut apart from this it is you, the students of\nImperial College, who are losing out. The\nevents have been publicised in FELIX and with\nposters\u2014do you really need the importance of\nthe event rammed down your throats?\nYou are fortunate to be at this College whilst\nRCS is in its centenary year. We have a chance to commemorate a hundred years of\nachievement and look forward to the future.\nAs an institution of higher education the RCS has a long tradition of excellence, and it is this\nwhich should be maintained and applauded\u2014\nfor it is this which has lead to the current\nstandards in the College and to the great\nopportunities offered to the students. We owe\na debt of gratitude to those whose hard work\nhas made all this possible.\nTo my mind it is a great pity that most of the\npresent student population cannot appreciate\nthe true significance s of these celebrations. I shall enjoy each event regardless and invite\nyou to join me.\nExecutive Names\nThe appeal for nicknames for the Executive\nhas received an overwhelming response. The\nresults are (in reverse order, of course):\nNick Morton: Who?, It'll be done by Xmas,\nAction Man.\nBarney McCabe: Grumpy, Lazy, The Goat.\nMarco Ledwold: Yes Barney, Yes Nick, Yes\nJen.\nDave Thompson: The Slob (all 52 entries).\nAndy Rushton: Mr Nice Guy, The Walking\nLampost.\nRoss Baxter: No entries (but he's working\non it).\nSeveral suggestions were made as to what I should be called\u2014but I didn't approve of that\nsort of language in print, so stop it!\nGuilds Hit Squad\nIt has become quite apparent that the Guilds\nHit Squad is getting a bit out of hand. Raising\nmoney by having a lot of fun is OK, but there\nare limits. It's no use raising money if, in the\nprocess, you start to become a real pain in the\narse. There's a time and place for every tnt ng. Most people, including lecturers, can take a joke, but disturbing busy people at the wrong\ntime and creating a lot of mess can only cause\na lot of bad feeling amongst the teaching and\ntechnical staff.\nSo stop acting like a bunch of moronic thugs\nand use a little bit of common sense.

An American correspondent who (in a subtle\nparody of my own nom-de-guerre) signs\nhimself 'Charlequin' wrote as follows:\nDear Scaramouche\nI don't know if you have such things in your\ncountry, but here one is often confronted with\nmultiple choice exams. Each question of these\ntests has seven possible answers, labelled AG and one is supposed to check off the right one.\nStudents have since the inception of these\nexams devoted much effort to finding the\n\"pattern\" to the correct answers and recently\na friend of mine succeeded.\nThe test which my friend successfully\nanalysed was in two parts\u2014the first consisting\nof 41 questions on English history, and the\nsecond of 101 questions on American history.\nShe has a good knowledge of English history\nand could determine, or reduce to two possibilities all but three of these questions as\nfollows:\n1. C15.B29.E2. C16.C30.A or F3.D17. G31.A or E4.B18.B or G32.B or D5.A or C19. G33.C6.D20. unknown 34. E7.E or G21.B or F35. F8.E22.E36. G9.F or G23. unknown 37. A10. A or E24.C or F38.F11.D25.

Then she recognized the pattern, and quickly\nfilled in the remaining answers.\nWhat is the pattern?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office, please. \u00a35 (donated by Mend-a Bike) and two tickets to IC Orchestra's concert next Wednesday for the correct\nsolution drawn on Wednesday at 1:00pm.

    "content": "Letters r to the\nW Editor\n\u2022taw\n1\n1 <^^s. Dear Mark\nour intemperate editorial comments on the Chaplaincy and the Rag Mag were based on wrong information in four major areas.\n1. The Chaplaincy is not\nagainst aRag Mag only against jokes which are violent, racist, and derogatory to sick and handicapped people. Chaplaincy members arc at present collecting jokes\nfor next years Rag Mag, so\nthat the charities the Union supports can benefit from the\nsale of a less offensive Mag.2. The large turnout at the\nU GM was not exclusively from the religious groups in College \u2014 would that we we had so many. You don't have to be a Chaplaincy member to object to the ' humour' of some of this year's Mag.3. The Chaplaincy did not\nbreak the Union Council ruling that the Mag was not\nto be circulated. Xo copy of\nthe Rag Mag was sent to\nLe pra or any other charity.4. Members of the Chaplaincy are interested in raising money for charity. As well as\ntheir individual participation in Rag events. West London Chaplaincy members in conjunction with the Catholic Chaplaincy have raised around \u00a3 4 , 0 0 0 per year lor\nthe last eight years for charities ranging from the homeless in\nLondon to providing technical education for orphans in Kenya. We are always glad you write about us in FELIX, Perhaps next time you would like to check with me(I amin my office most afternoons, int\n4 2 2 1 ) so that your future articles have a basis in fact as\nwell as in your lively i mag in a tion.\nTours sincerely\nDavid Ash forth Chaplain Whilst I agree with you that following the U GM the issue ol the\nRag Mag is closed (editorial\nNovember131981), I cannot allow to go unchallenged the\nrather unpleasant remarks that you made about the Chaplaincy. I will attempt to\nsupply facts to deal with your comments in the order in which they were made. En masse voting \u2014 whilst it\nis true that the Chaplaincy and other religious societies\nhad a major part in the success of the S CC amendment, it was also supported by other societies and, I believe, a large number of\nstudents unconnected with any particular society. Nobody seems to have been too much concerned about en masse voting by RS Mon pro South Africa issues in the past.\nThe suggestion that Chaplaincy members are more concerned with moral issues\nthan the welfare ol others and the support of charities is\nquite untrue. We live in the\nreal world and, together with the Catholic Chaplaincy and students from other colleges,\nwe annually raise more than \u00a3 3 , 0 0 0 lorou r adopted charity. In addition we have, in the past, supported two Third World students although we\nhave not been able to do so\nthis year.\nTwo letters were sent, to\nLe pra and the Disabled Students Association, in order to establish the fact that 'jokes', such as the ones in the\nRag Mag, do harm sufferers\ndespite the fact that they may only be sold to students. \"Fhe\nreply from Le pra, read out in the U GM, adequately proved this point. To my knowledge the letters were sent prior to\nthe Council motion on the\nbasis of one' review copy' received by the Chaplains from the Deputy President. In any case, I seriously doubt whether Council has the right\nto stop anyone writing a letter\nto whoever they wish, so\n' disobeyed' is an inappropriate word to use. You don't appear to be so strident about all the people who will have\nHogged their copies to friends\nfor a vast profit.\nThis firing s me to ' sell righteous prat s'. The College Chaplain actually sent the\nletters \u2014 now I've heard people be a bit disparaging about him. but this takes the\nbiscuit. As with the rest of us,\nyou, sir, are entitled to your opinion, but I'm sure that\nwhen FELIX readers have\nread this letter they might begin to wonder who the prat\nreally is. As for damage, I believe that because of the\nU GM this has been very limited, but I deny that any has been caused by the Chaplaincy.} ours ele\nSteve Readings Chaplaincy Chairman Dear Mark\n\u00a7 would like to correct\nyour editorial in last\nweek's FELIX concerning the Chaplaincy. Firstly, we're no*, self righteous prat s! Secondly, we did not disobey the Council motion, as the Rag Mag was not sold\nto several charities, but a few\nrelevant \" jokes\" sent. Nor has\nit caused much of the damage we were trying to prevent, as\nit was sent to the administrators of the charities and not\nthose afflicted. If you were so\ndamn concerned about obeying the Council motion you wouldn't have printed the advert loran I CRag Mag, priced at \u00a325. DoI smell a hypocrite? Thirdly, many of us do put\nin time to collect money for\ncharity; last year the Chaplaincy raised about \u00a34,000,\napproximately one third of\nwhat Rag raised last year.\nAnd fourth1 y, we will gladly contribute jokes for the\nRag Mag. Next time, get a proper reporter to investigate the facts!\n) ours sincerely\nGraeme Shaw Dear Mark\n' it h reference to last\nweek's editorial:1. You implied that it was\nonly the religious societies who, by their vote, prevented the Rag Mag being sold. In fact, Guilds Gen Com m had already taken the initiative by\nrefusing to sell it.\n2. You said that those who voted to ban it should try to\nrecoup the money. As Michael Foot has recently been trying to enforce, members of a group should abide by the\ncollective decisions of that group, and therefore everyone\nshould try to recoup the money.3. You implied that members of religious so cie ites are\nnot bothered about collecting money lor charity. Last year\nthe Chaplaincies, with a membership of about200 students, raised \u00a3 3 , 0 0 0 for charity. ICU, with a membership twenty times greater, managed \u00a312.000.\n4. Two years ago, following the outcry against an offensive Rag Mag, aUG M voted that it must not be sold\nto the general public. The producers of this Rag Mag chose to ignore that indication of student opinion, and are\ntherefore largely to blame for\nthe situation we are in.5. I 'he Chaplaincy did not\nsell the Rag Mag to external bodies: a review copy was\npassed on to the charities. I suggest that Rag Mags sold\nonly lo IC students would find\ntheir way outside College in a similar manner and in far\ngreater numbers. F he Rag Mags were sent to people\nalready helping the victims concerned; had the Rag Mag been sold in College, not only might it have reached the\nvictims themselves, but it\nwould alms ot certainly have\nprejudiced people against helping and befriending them.) inns sincerely\nMartin E. Bradley BE3 Not a Editor is: And behold it tame to pass\nthat the Editor did receive an heap of contradictory letters,\nand there was a great conf u sion. For lo, il is written that\nthou can st not rely upon the\nChaplaincy to get their story\nstraight and( despite the pretence of innocence) the v have all admitted that indeed it was the v who performed the\nfoul deed.\nPage 4 FEUX, November 20, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nShort Sharp\nWillie at IC\nMr William Whitelaw, the Home Secretary for State,\naddressed the Conservative Society on Tuesday,\nNovember 17. The title of the lecture was \"My role as\nHome Secretary\".\nApproximately350 students turned up in Me chEng220 to\nhear Mr Whitelaw speak. Of the subjects talked about were\nrace relations, the role of the law and, of course, Ireland. In all the speech, although well received, was quite uncontroversial and afterwards a somewhat furtive question\ntim e took place.\nAlso present were four uniformed policemen plus some\nplaine d clothes police for the Home Secretary' s protection. It is\nalso believed that an unofficial Guilds hit squad were going to\ntl an Mr Whitelaw and this would seem to explain the presence\nQ1 Guilds representatives at the door to prevent this happening. In general, Mr Whitelaw was reaffirming the Government's economic policy. Of many of the questions asked were such inquiries as to MrI an Paisley's recent activities as well as the\nretirement of Lord Den ning. Another issue which was raised\nconcerned the emergence of the SDP, on this issue Mr Whitelaw simply stated that \" the Social Democrats have no policy\". Mr Whitelaw delivered a well received speech\n. and he answered the questions quite comprehensively, to the considerable satisfaction of the\naudience, who by their applause at the end of\nthe talk indicated their gratefulness of Mr White law's acceptance of their invitation to come to IC. Left: Mr While/aw addresses the meeting. (Photo\nJane Williams)\nRCS Centenary\nKicks Off\nThe centenary celebrations of the Royal College of\nScience were started on Monday by Lord Todd, OM FRS,\nPresident of the Society of Chemical Industry.\nIn a fascinating lecture entitled\" Chemistry past and present\", he outlined some of the important steps in the\ndevelopment of chemistry over the past 100 years. As someone\nwho had been involved in Chemistry and the Chemical Industry for over 50 years, he presented a personal view of the\nsubject with a care and insight which betrayed deep concern and excitement for its future.\nThe Rector chaired the meeting and a vote of thanks was\nproposed by Dr Blow, Dean of RCS. On Monday evening an exhibition commemorating the\ncentenary was opened in the Consort Gallery. The exhibition, organised by Mrs J. Ping ree the College Archivist, contains\nhistorical material from the various departments of RCS and gives a good opportunity to see some glimpses of the College's past. It will remain open until the end of term. Tuesday lunchtime was marked by a lecture by A.H. Watkins, Chairman of the national H.G. Wells Society who spoke on\" H.G. Wells the early years\". He outlined the\nchildhood and early manhood of Wells, including his time at\nthe Royal College of Science, to a disappointingly small audience in Physics LT1.A lunchtime concert by Concertante of London, a wind octet, was held on\nWednesday. It was well attended and obviously enjoyed by all those\npresent.\nThe centenary events continue next week.\nRight: Lord Todd in full\nswing during the first RCS\nCentenary lecture.

    "content": "Getting together\nwith QEC\nThe possibility ola collaboration between IC and QE C is being looked into by officials of both colleges in order to determine whether this can be achieved efficiently or indeed at all. QE C has approximately1,200 students and its campus is\nbasically divided into two buildings, the older of the two houses\nhalls of residences, a library and the admins t ration section and the departments of microbiology and nutrition whereas the other building encompasses the physics, maths and chemistry departments. The UGC budget for QE C for the session 1 9 8 1 / 2 for expenditure is /,2.74m( compared to an expenditure budget of \u00a323.91 m for IC). However QE C have been under considerable\nfinancial strain recently, considerably more so than IC. Although nothing solid has taken place concerning the issue\none of the possibilities being discussed ;is that of moving life\nsciences across to the QE C campus. When Nick Morton was questioned about the\" merger\" of\ntwo student unions( with somewhat different views) he stated\nthat the QE C students are\" very proN US\" and\" quite left\nwing\" he so stated that he would\" hate to have an antagonistic\nl actor up the road\". Nick went on to state that at such time as\nQE C becomes part of IC there would be a very strong cause for\nare le ren dum.As for the history of this possibility of merger it appears that\nafter the S winner ton Dyer Report suggested a closer collaboration between QE Can dIC, IC let it be known that\nthey were open to approaches, it was at this stage that an approach was made by Q EC.As for his own Dart in the discussions, Nick stated that\nfollowing the report of the working party the Rector would then\nconsult the ICU President and it is hoped that the voice of the\nSU would be given considerable weight.\nIn any event, a decision whether or not to collaborate will be\ntaken by the governing body by about December. Fare's Fair Fellah\nRCS win\nraft race\nDespite a near-capsize and the air resistance of Dave Thompson' s shorts, RCS won Sunday's raft race in a thrilling split hair finish. Guilds came second in a strong field of two, and claims that Mines won with an\" invisible raft\" were discounted due to lack of photographic evidence.\nThe teams set out from Princes G dns at 10:45am, and the advantage of the ultra lightweight cardboard and plastic craft of RCS became apparent as they took the lead. As Guilds also had to\nassemble their three-part raft\nbefore launching, RCS landed with a three minute lead.\nDue to a last minute course\nchange to avoid non-existent\nMines' divers, both sides landed behind bars ( in the\nfenced-ol fli do area) and had to pass the rafts over the railings. RCS arrived back at\nSouthside in a time of fifteen\nminutes, with Guilds walking in five minutes later alter having their exec chat to a passing policeman. Controversy still rages over\nthe unr alt like structure of the\nRCS craft; it has been officially\ndescribed as a' pointed c oracle'. In Memorlam:\nMonty\nIn the early hours ol Sunday, November15, Monty the Montpelier Street cat suffered\na fatal accident on a road in the vicinity of the Hall. The cat was known to IC students by many other names which it is not necessary to repeat here. The history of this feline friend\ncovers affections by such bodies as the R CSU as well as\nthe FELIX Editor. He provided companionship to weary students after a hard day at the College and will be\nmissed by all. The name Monty was given to the cat by Dr Don Mon ro who brought him down from Weeks Hall to\nMontpelier Street.\nDave We tze l, the GLC trans-port spokesman, addressed the Labour Club on Tuesday. Naturally, Labour's plan for\nLondon Transport was his\ntheme. As is now apparent, Dave confirmed that present\npolicy is to improve services\nand reduce lares. A Utopian situation, he said, would be a comprehensive, free public transport system. Agreeing that this is a socialist ideal, Dave dismissed the allegations\nthat County Hall housed extremists by saying he had n't\" ready anything in Marx about the GLC\". Overall, London Transport fares have been reduced by a third. Mr We tze l claimed that the former Conservative GLC administration had planned to increase fares by a quarter. Quoting figures, Dave said that levying the\ncontroversial supplementary rate would mean Londoners paying an average of \u00a3 1 . 3 0\nper week for reduced fares.\nHe accused Mrs Thatcher of\" crying her crocodile tears\",\nsaying that the Government could lessen this amount by restoring the grant it wit held from the GLC. Dave didn't comment on the possible outcomes of the current action against the GLC as regards levying supplementary rates. However, he personally would rather take a\"moral stand\" against the law than fail to\ncarryout Labour's manifesto.\nMr We t/.el consequently accused Environment Secret ary Michael He sel tinc of trying to stifle local councillors. Mr He sel tinc was alleged to be hoping to shift\nthe burden of rates from commercial taxpayers to individuals. This, Dave said,\nwas \" totally unacceptable to\nus... and to Londoners\". Twenty\nquid\nrebate\nA meeting of the Student Residents Committee last Wednesday week concluded. that a rent rebate for Montpelier Street residents should be awarded. The value ol this\nrebate was put at \u00a3 2 0 .\nThe Montpelier Si. Hall committee had earlier suggested that a figure of \u00a324\nwould be a suitable amount. Present at the meeting were\nrepresentatives of the Student\nUnion, including Nie kM ot ton\n( ICU President).\nThe general feeling amongst\nresidents is that although a rebate recognises that con ditions at the start of term were not satisfactory, the value of \u00a320 is a somewhat meagre figure. It is highly unlikely that any further action will betaken. The rebate, which will be deducted from next term's rent,\nrepresents a loss in revenue of about \u00a31,700 to the College. r \u2014=mmM i%== C0LLteE=\nCONDUCTOR Ricnani Dfcklns\nBRAHMS\nAcademic Festival\nOverture BEETHOVEN\nTrip!*\nConcerto\nRfMSKiK0RSXK0V\nSHe Waz a cie at SpmoriWgJnedW\n2 5 th Nov\nIntheGreatHall\nFEUX, November 20, 1981 Page 3\n\n"
