The first part of the\ncompetition was run as a league, in\nwhich the first team finished second,\nclose behind Guys Hospital, while the\nsecond team dropped out of sight. The\ntop four teams then went through to the\nsemi-finals. Unfortunately for IC one of\nour first team helms then had to go\nhome, and his second team replacement\nwas not of the same calibre, as IC\nnarrowly lost to University College,\nwhom they'd beaten earlier. Guy's Hospital eventually thrashed IC in the\nfinal, but didn't enter into the spirit of the\ncompetition, and it was left to IC and UC to celebrate in the normal fashion.\nWater Polo\nAny women out there?

    "content": "Union Scuffle\nIn the early hours of Thursday morning a scuffle erupted in the union bar. The\nincident was serious enough for one of\nthe concerned parties to be appearing\nbefore a union disciplinary hearing in the\nnear future.\nAccording to a union source the\natmosphere at the end of Wednesday\nevening had become rather fraught. The\nbar staff were hassled by a clientele that\nbecame increasingly difficult.\nA spokesperson from the R SMU stated\nthat 'we were all out of there by 11pm' and that they knew absolutely nothing\nabout the incident.\nPaper Money\nThe newspaper of Kings College, Casey L, is be lei ved to be suffering financial\ndifficulties. A King's College student told\nFelix that the paper had used up all its\n\u00a36000 grant and hadn't managed to raise\nthe \u00a34000 from advertising that it\nexpected to.\nIn response, Ms Turner, editor of Casey\nL, said that \u00a32000 was left over from a \u00a38000 grant, which would last at least\nuntil the 24th April, when she said that\nshe would leave. She said that the paper\ncame out usually once every two weeks.\nShe added that they 'were doing\ndisastrously ' but were now doing fine.\nAccess Closed\nApplications for the access fund are now\nclosed. The expected last minute flood\ndoubled the total number of applicants\nfrom 220 on Thursday to 560 by 5pm on\nFriday.\nMr Cullen, the person in charge of the\naccess fund , thanked Felix for helping to\npublicise the fund's existence. Mr Cullen\nfelt that the most effective way of\ncommunicating with students was through\nFelix and that articles in Felix had\ndirectly contributed to the last minute\nsurge in applications.\nMr Cullen said that he had 'made good\nprogress' with with the enormous pile of\napplications. Successful applicants will\nreceive their money by the end of term.\n2\nLibyan Link\nImperial College has made a 'substantial'\noffer for the thirteen year leasehold of\nthe ex-Libyan Embassy on Exhibition\nRoad. The college is now awaiting\nplanning permission to convert the\nbuilding for academic use.\nAlthough the remaining leasehold is\ncomparatively short, the prime position of\nthe building has kept the value of the\nleasehold high.\nThe University of London holds the\nfreehold and this has been a major\nconsideration in the decision to make an\noffer. When the thirteen year lease\nexpires, IC will probably be able to\nextend it further.\nWhat A Mug\nA beer mug was thrown from Tizard Hall\non Monday night, narrowly missing a local resident. According to John Hassard,\nTizard's warden he could have been\nkilled had the glass hit him.\nThe student who threw the glass, who\ndidn't come from Tizard Hall, is due to\nface a disciplinary hearing within the\nnext week. The most severe punishment\nthe student might suffer is expulsion from\ncollege.\nThe resident called the police after the\nincident and has written to Sir Eric Ash and the mayor of Kensington and\nChelsea. Dr Hassard said that the incident\ncan only strain relations with the mews\nresidents which was poor at the best of\ntimes. He said that it might threaten\nplanning permission for an extension to\nthe gym and he was also concerned\nabout damage to the overall reputation of\nthe college.\nTheft Corner\nComputers worth \u00a33500 were stolen from\nthe Huxley building this week. The room\nin which they were kept was well\nsecured except for a bit which could only\nhave been known about by somebody\nknowing the room well. The security\nproblem has now been solved.\nSome vending machines have been\nbroken into, the amounts taken being 'not\nworth the bother' according to Geoff\nReeves, IC's chief security officer. He\nsuspects that people sleeping rough or\nhard up have been responsible and added\nthat there had been more thefts from cars\nin the last three months than in the last\nthree years.\nA Jaguar car parked behind the\nChemistry building had its wing mirrors\nripped off this week. Security officers said\nthat this was probably due to 'kids taking\nit out on a car or two.'\nHAIRDRESSERS15 A HARRINGTON ROAD, SOUTH KENSINGTON0718238968 We have a fantastic offer for all you students, a cut wash and blow dry by our top stylist\n(which normally costs around \u00a321)\nFor only \u00a311 Men \u00a312 Women Check us out !\nSTRESS\nRELAXATION\nSESSIONS\nTue 26 Feb\n&\nThur 28 Feb\nGiving up smoking\nseminar\nFriday 1 March\nNo charge\u2014sign up in the\nUnion Office a.s. a. p.UR OP: Undergraduate\nResearch Opportunities\nProgramme\nAre you thinking of doing paid URO P work with a member of IC faculty\nduring the summer vacation 1991?\nIf you are, please try to settle details as\nsoon as possible so that the member of\nfaculty can, if necessary, apply for\nfunds.\nFor further details of the UROP scheme, see\nthe UROP 1990-1991 Directory available (free)\nfrom the UROP office, Room 313C, Level 3,\nMechanical Engineering Building.\n\n"

With the\nenvironmental society suddenly becoming\nan inclusive, not an exclusive\norganisation everyone was jumping on\nthe 'environmentally aware consumer'\nbandwagon; organic food, low energy\nlightbulbs, biodegradable bin liners. Roisin\nOrosz of Ark points out that 'people read\nand believe what they see at Sainsbury's, whilst government publications are still\nignored.'\nInstantly the press branded industry the\n'bad guys'. Pressure groups inherited the\nhalo and were assumed righteous. It was\ntheir role not to see ICI's point of view.\nICI justify their work as trying to increase\npeople's standard of living.

This is the debut single of The\nStarlings who originally come from New\nZealand. There are five tracks\u2014starting\nwith a cover of The Byrds classic Wasn't Born to Follow, with added dance beat how very original. The title track Letter\nfrom Heaven was inspired by the story of\na convicted drug smuggler who is hung\nbefore his mother receives his last letter.\nHence the title: Letter from Heaven. The\nwords (there aren't many of them) are\nsung over bluesy riffs, ending with 'Look\ninto the eyes of death and never feel\nyour baby's breath' (apparently a quotation from an episode of The\nWaltonsW).\nTwo of the three songs on the B side\nseem to reveal an obsession about razor\nblades. Razor Girl\u2014'She cut 666 into my skin' and 'Helloween Candy\u2014there's razor\nblades in the Helloween Candy' (??) aren't really worth a mention. (Please note that\nHelloween is not a spelling mistake.) The\nfinal track, My Sympathy, has a definite\nVelvet Underground feel to it.

    "content": "The Adventures of\nFord\nFairlane\nAndrew Dice Clay is an American\ncomedian who specialises in the\nnew breed of hate comedy.\nTo launch him as a movie star in a mainstream comedy/action film, such as\nthis, may seem to be something of a bad\nmove. And indeed it is.\nFord Fairlane is an American comic\nstrip detective (is it just me, or does this\nsound familiar?) who specialises in Rock\n'n' Roll. He gets involved in a plot which is either so (a) complex or (b) badly\nwritten, that I didn't understand a word\nof it. However, it does involve a brainless\nbim bette,3 CD's, a record producer who\npisses in the punch, Jimi Hendrix's guitar,\na penis called Stanley, the lead singer of\na heavy metal band, an explosive\nmicrowave and a koala. Ford does very\nlittle actual detective work, preferring to\nprofane, punch and pucker his way\nthrough the film, while his red-headed\nbombshell of a secretary solves the case\n(and gets thrown out of the window).\nDespite the above, the film is not as\ngood as it sounds. There is potential both\nin the script, despite the ridiculously\nsentimental ending, and in Clay's performance, but they are both badly let\ndown by gross directorial mishandling.\nThe director, Renny Harlin, is best known for his work in action movies, and it\nshows. The crashes and fights are superb,\nbut many of the best lines lost.\nThere is some potential for a cult\nfollowing here, but otherwise a potentially good movie seems\ncon demme d to sink without trace.\nPendragon.\nFlesh Gordon 2\nFlesh Gordon Meets the Cosmic Cheerleaders\nEmperor Wang managed to survive\nthe cataclysmic explosion on the\nplanet Porno and has now\nreappeared on the Ice Planet with the\nFrigid Queen. Further research and\nextensive tests with the sex ray have\nnow produced the Impotance Ray, which he uses on a nearby planet. Here the\nCheerleaders of Cosmic High, faced with\nan unsatisfied sex drive go in search of\nthe most virile member of the human\nrace\u2014Flesh Gordon.\nThey kidnap Flesh from Dale's loving\nclutches, forcing Dale and our old friend\nFlexi Jerkoff to per sue Flesh in a spaceship powered by the energy of\ncopulating chickens, facing the dangers of\nan as steroid belt and the chickens\nrunning out of steam, they finally meet\nup with Flesh and the Cosmic\nCheerleaders in the land of the Turd People.\nEscaping to the Ice Planet they have to\nstop Wang from bathing the Earth in\nim pot ance radiation so strong that Flesh\nis in danger from it, though it would be\ntoo late for him as his organ would have\nbeen transplanted.\nI think that sums up the plot, which on\npaper is funny and, indeed, the film has a few good funny lines to offer. While the\nacting is abysmal, the are models\namusing and in several cases very crude.\nUnfortunatly, it has totally lost the spirit\nthat the first film had and is nothing\nmore than a cheap sequel. If you like\nseeing big tits on the big screen this is\nyour film, otherwise don't go and see it!\nKiller Bob.\n\u2014 Film Men at Work\nOh dear. A movie written and\ndirected by Emilio Estevez, and\n\u2014\nstarring himself and his brother,\nCharlie Sheen. Who are they playing?\nGarbage men. What do they do? Find a dead body. What do they do with it?\nCarry it around with them, along with a mad Vietnam vet and a kidnapped Pizza\nman. Meanwhile Carl (Mr Sheen) is\nmaking the dead man's campaign\nmanager fall in love with him, by using\nhis knowledge of her, gleaned from\nwatching her in her apartment, by means\nof a pair of binoculars. Uh-huh.\nThis film should have been really bad.\nIt nearly makes it, but the principals have\nenough feckless charm to sustain the\nthing, at least for an undemanding\nadolescent audience. In its favour, it\ninitially avoids going straight for the\nwham bang action approach, instead\nopting for something that is a fairly close\nimitation of character development. But\nnot that close.\nThe twists are obvious, the jokes\nsimplistic ally funny, and the climax, well,\nsilly. There are worrying homophobic\nundertones in the treatment of the\npolicemen, and the Vietnam vet, although\ngetting all the best lines, is not exactly\nsympathetically handled. Admittedly, I did\nlaugh occasionally. But not that much.\nNot great.\nPendragon.\n\n"

    "content": "Real Funding\nDear Andy,\nBaa! There is supposed to be a committee structure in ICU that exists to\nensure that when a decision is made, it\nreflects the views of the student populous.\nStudents at IC are represented by the\nsabbaticals and elected representatives,\nboth social and academic. Yet these\npeople have so little to say at the\nrelevant meetings.\nI write with particular reference to the\nCouncil meeting of February 11 1991.\nAnyone who attends one of these, and\nany student is so entitled, will have\nnoticed that few people bother to take\npart in important discussions.\nFor example, \u00a34,000 was passed from\nUFCs (University Funding Council) budget,\nwithout a full UFC being called. The\nChairman (Benjamin Turner) is a member\nof Council, but allowed this to happen.\nReal Driving\nThere was a definite conflict of interests,\nbut the various representatives of the\npopulous appeared unconcerned. There\nwas more debate concerning a new\nsociety forming, and then there was\nabout \u00a34,000 being released for market\nresearch, with the potential for a much\nhigher expenditure (from where?) should\nthe authorised company suggest it.\nAlthough would this pass (!) through the\ncommittee structure I am concerned that\nthousands more could be 'rubber-stamped'\nin a similar way.\nIt is disappointing that so few members\nof Council (the Union's sovereign body)\nqueried the rush release of funds so that\nthe President could confirm his plans to\nthe company immediately after the\nmeeting.\nRD Eyers, Publications Board Chair.\nDear Andy,\nLet's get straight to the point, no\nreligion, no sex, just driving.\nWhat is a Petromizer? We'll believe the\nclaims made when we see them\u2014and\nlook forward to hearing from Dr John\nSpeight.\nIn response to the cars and the\nenvironment article in FELIX891 there\nare a few points we would like to make,\nbut first one question.\n1. Who wants a Porsche anyway\u2014all\nPorsches sold today have catalytic\nconverters fitted as standard, you name\nus one Real Man who'd drive a car with a cat\u2014much better to buy a car without\none to avoid the boring job of cutting the\nthing out of the exhaust and fitting a bit\nof drain pipe in its place?\n2. 120 kph? Are you in town? If you\nget bored at this speed take some advice\nfrom a Real Man and either a) drive\nfaster or b) throw the car sideways for\nthe sheer hell of it.\n3. If one in four drivers are not\nconcentrating on driving may we\nhypothesize that SHE is probably\nadjusting her make-up in the rear view\nmirror (what else could it possibly be for\ngirls?) Before you jump to the typewriter\nto say that women have less accidents\nthan men\u2014of course they don't and the\nreason for this is blatantly obvious to all.\nWomen don't drive as fast as men. It's a sure bet that if they could they'd have a lot more accidents.\n4. You might find it alarming to find\nthat a car is made every second but rest\nassured that most of these will not be\nReal Cars. For example a Fiesta is not a Real Car, a Lancia Delta Integrate S4 is!\nA Real Car must have:\na) A male driver\nb) No catalytic converter\nc) Run on leaded petrol\nd)4 wheel drive\ne)At least 250 bhp\nA Real Car does not have enough room\nfor sex\u2014if it does then the engine isn't big enough. As for picking your nose may\nwe remind women drivers\u2014two hands on\nthe steering wheel unless changing gear.\n5. Electric vehicles! Are you joking?\nBy definition electric vehicles cannot be\nexciting to drive. Maximum torque at\nzero revs make for a boring power curve.\nWheel spin becomes impossible. We don't want wheel spin to tear away from traffic\nlights like boy-racers, it is merely a necessity to soften the gear change from\nfirst to second.\nAs far as the environment goes (and\nthat's not far is it?) electric vehicles\nsimply shift the source of pollution from\nthe exhaust pipe to the chimney of the\npower station.\n6. The Lotus Carlton gives us the Horn.\n176 mph. Where and why? Everywhere\nand why not?\nMay we now pose our solutions to\nBritain's motoring problems.\n1. Ban all women from driving. This\nwill reduce the number of cars on the\nroads by at least 5 0 % and emissions by a similar amount.\n2. Remove all speed limits and the\ndriver's liability for personal injury to\nothers. This will further reduce the\nresidual congestion\u2014traffic speeds will\nincrease dramatically and the residual\npedestrians will be faster at crossing the\nroads.\n3. Issue all Real Men with Lotus\nCarltons, preferably with a Nitro kit as\n176 is a bit slow, oh and a cow catcher would be a bit useful.\nYours sideways,\nSome Real Men.\nLETTERS\nWhat's On\nAN UP-TO-THE-MINUTE GUIDE TO EVENTS\nIN AND AROUND IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nKeep Fit 3 . 3 0 pm Southside Gym.\nIntermediate Rock 'n' Roll 6.00pm JCR.\nSwimming 6.30pm Sports Centre.

    "content": "Short Time\nShort Time is about a cop on the\nedge...oops, sorry, a cop with a short time left both on the beat and\nin his life. Said cop is one Burt Simpson\n(either a desperate publicity bid or a gaffe\nof vast and degenerate proportions) and\nall his life he has lived for the future,\nplanning for his kid's Harvard education\nand his own long-term financial security.\nAfter a mix-up at the doctor's( doesn't it\nalways happen to you, boys 'n' girls?)\nBurt is told, to his dismay, that he has\nonly a few weeks to live and, even\nworse, that his life insurance only pays\nup if he gets wasted in action. So bearing\nin mind 111* Dougie's future Burt sets out\nto kill himself, provoking much bemuse ment from his mild-mannered\npartner, played by Mat Frewer in a frantic effort to escape type-casting as a robot video jockey (and thus missing out\non a lucrative contract with MTV). If I wanted to damn this movie I need say\nnothing more now than there follows a series of touching tableaux as Burt\nconfronts his true feelings, as well as his\nbumbling attempts to commit suicide on\nthe beat, invariably (and naturally) ending\nin commendations for heroism. However\nthis would be unfair, since it would\nignore the startling similarities between\nthis and the other parent-kiddy-love film\nout this week (see elsewhere this issue).\nFirst of all we are treated to another\nbizarre Sesame Street crossover since\nBurt's partner is named Ernie and, being\nplayed by Frewer, he bears more than a slight resemblance to the Great Yellow\nOne both in character and looks. I cannot\nbring myself to believe this is accidental.\nSecondly, in both, we are treated to\nacting performances which scrape the\nedge of saccharine sentimentality without\nactually taking the plunge and thirdly, do\nwe end up root in' for the hero pop kids ?\nYep, I think so; by the end of the movie\nBurt has so efficiently turned his life\naround that I was praying he didn't destroy the 12 certificate by actually\nsnuffing it. Or does he ?\nShort Time is alternately fairly moving,\nif you're easily moved, fairly exciting, if\nyou're easily excited, and amusing, even\nif you're a miserable sod (Would the real\nAlan Bailey please stand up?). A film\ngreater than the sum of its parts.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nThe Crop\nThe Crop, winner of three Critic's Prizes at the Brighton Film\nConference for Best Foreign Film,\nBest New Director and Best Supporting\nActor opens in Britain on February 15th. It is a masterfully sombre reworking of\nthe great Yugoslav director Varschek's Hard Winter (Die Unglucklischewinter);\nthe director has made his debut with a compassionate and moving portrayal of a simple potato farmer before the outbreak\nof hostilities in the First World War.\nPerter Weinstag (better known as Ralph\nMalph in Happy Days) commands the\nscreen with a presence reminiscent of the\nearly work of Fritz Lang as he fights to\nraise-his people from the earth to a land\nhe calls Glucklichuberalles (the land of\nlove). Unfortunately for Perter, the\nwoman he loves, Falia (played by Glenda\nJackson) is pregnant with the bastard son\nof the Burgermeister (Vincent Price). The\nroots of Perter's faith are tested in a moving scene inter cut with Falia's seduction, which swirls with barely\nrestrained eroticism. Perter is forced to\nlead the villagers on a quest across the\nSiberian steppe in search of his vision, in\na trek that brings hardship and pain to\nthose he loves. In a dramatic avalanche\nsequence Falia is crippled in the third\nmonth of her pregnancy; a potato blight\nthreatens the very stability of the village.\n(Die Kroppe)\nWith stout direction from Jon Pertwee,\nproving himself more than simply a fine\nactor, this film leaves the viewer's mind\nfull of complex resonances which persist\nlong after the film has ended. When Falia\ngives birth to the two headed fish (in a dream sequence handled with a minimum of taste) after eating a bad potato, the\nvillagers ostracize her, calling her 'The\nBad One' and the viewer is left full of\nguilt but also anger.\nThe film is a stark metaphor for our\ntimes, from its metaphysical use of the\npotato as a symbol for fornication to the\nprolonged (sometimes several minutes)\nshots of empty fields. Pertwee's crisp\ndirection gives a challenging and\nsometimes frankly disturbing insight into\none man's love for his root vegetable.\nThe Crop is also rich in incidental detail;\ntry and spot Clive Dunn in a rare cameo\nrole as Stalin, or the moment briefly\nglimpsed where Tarkin tries to sell Perter\na hard core porn video. Unfortunately the\nfilm is marred by the clownish buffoonery\nof Una Stubbs, appearing as the naive\nand voluptuous daughter of Dienstag\n(Lionel Blair), although the sequence in\nwhich she is dragged away by the\nmerciless agents of the secret police\n(Frank Muir and Arthur Marshall) is\nstrikingly effective.\nAlthough shot in black and white, and\ndistracting at times with the poor Italian\ntranslation of the Serbo-Croat dialogue,\nThe Crop is an unmissable treat for\nstudents of the tuber, and a treasure for\ngenerations to come.\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine\nAnd Friend.\n4\n\n"

    "content": "Real Opinion\nDear Andy,\nAt the risk of boring everyone to death,\nI'd like to continue the great IC Abortion\nDebate. So far we've heard from Pro-Life,\nChristians, a prat and a Greek goddess.\nAs I fit none of these categories I hope to\noffer an original point of view.\nAbortion enthusiasts at Imperial appear\nto agree on the need for a time limit, and\nthankfully no one has yet advocated the\ngood old NUS stance of abortion on\ndemand up to birth. Athena suggested\nthis limit should be 'the time at which the\nbaby can safely be removed and survive',\nbut this is arbitrary and impractical. It\ndepends on the health of the mother, on\nthe equipment available, on how many\nnursing unions are on strike that week,\non lots of things. The only way to tell if a baby will survive is to deliver it by\nCaesarian section, hook it up to a mega-expensive incubator, pump it full of\ndrugs, and wait and see. I doubt this\nwould be a satisfactory situation, either to\nthe mother who wants rid of the child, or\nthe taxpayer who is splashing out on\nthousands of incubators. To avoid this\nyou could err on the side of caution, and\nset a lower limit at which the child\ndefinitely couldn't survive, but I don't think this would satisfy Athena.\nThe suggestion I favour is the one I think Jason Pike was aiming at in FELIX888. If we could identify a time' t' at\nwhich life begins we could use that as\nour limit. Before the\negg/foetus/embryo/child is just a blob,\nand you can do what you want with it;\ndestroy it, experiment on it, play football\nwith it, the choice is entirely that of the\nwoman concerned. But after t this sack of\nchemicals, DNA and what have you is by\ndefinition alive, and must enjoy the\nsimple right not to be killed just because\nit isn't wanted.\nSo it's off to the Biology Department to\ndefine't'. When does life begin? At fertilisation? At implantation in the\nwomb? Or when the brain starts to\nfunction in a particular way? Or not until\nbirth? Even later, when the child first\nrealises it is alive? Forty? Maybe Bishop\nBerkely was right, and nobody is ever\nalive because they are all just figments of\nyour imagination.\nArmed only with a biology ' 0 ' Level, I would tentatively suggest that life begins\nat conception, for the usual reasons\n(identifiable individual, unique DNA, etc).\nIf someone out there knows better, please\nsay.\nAs far as I can tell, abortion is the\nkilling of a human being, which certainly\nshouldn't be encouraged. There are, of\ncourse, times when killing people is okay.\nFor instance, shooting an armed terrorist\nor psychopath is usually a pretty wise\nmove. Killing a foetus is necessary if\ncontinuing with the pregnancy will injure\nthe mother. But what of pregnancies\narising from rape or incest? And what\nabout pregnancies 'in ju rous to the mental\nhealth of the mother'? I dare not pass\njudgement on these cases, for fear of\nprovoking the wrath of Athena and other\nfeminists; but I don't think it should be\nsolely up to the woman involved whether\nto kill her child. We are talking about\n180,000 avoidable deaths a year: there\nmust be some national consensus on\nwhen this is and isn't acceptable. I hope\nthat one day people will stop regarding\nabortion as another means of family\nplanning, and will recognise it as a specialised and rather gruesome form of\ninfanticide. Maybe then the social\npressures which today force women to\nhave abortions will be removed. If the\nanguish and despair many pregnant\nwomen suffer is replaced with concern\nfor the welfare of their child, that would\ndo more than any amount of legislation\nto reduce the senseless slaughter this\ncountry currently condones.\nYours,\nUltan McCarthy.\nSimple Truth LETTERS\nWhat'sOn AN UP-TO-THE-MINUTE GUIDE TO EVENTS\nIN AND AROUND IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nBike Club 1 2 . 4 5 pm Southside Lounge.\nCycling Training l.

    "content": "Ken Livingstone Speaks\nKen Livingstone, Labour MP, attended the\nLabour party Anti-War meeting on\nTuesday. Professor Steven Rose, a recognised expert on chemical warfare\nand formerly at the biochemistry\ndepartment of Imperial College opened\nthe meeting.\nProfessor Rose examined the role of\nbiological and chemical weapons are\nplaying in the Gulf Conflict. He said that\nwestern governments had not compete ly removed their stockpile of chemical\nweapons, all of which are illegal under\ninternational laws. He added that western\ngovernments had failed to condemn\nPresident Hussein's chemical attacks on\nthe Kurdish population.\nCommenting on the possible threat of\nbiological weapons being used by Iraq he\nsaid that they 'don't make military sense'\nand that a biological attack would 'have a beginning but absolutely no end.'\nProfessor Rose described the war as an\n'unmitigated disaster environmentally' and\nadded that the United Nations resolution\nwas 'a fig leaf of respectability to cover\nup the nakedness pf US imperialism'.\nHe went on to say ' a continued western\npresence in the Gulf after the war would\nbe a constant expense to us and an\nirritation to Arab nationalism.'\nKen Livingstone said that the reason for\nthe relatively small size of th6 peace\nmovement in Britain as compared to the\nUS could be blamed upon the uniquely\nconservative British press. He added that\nthere was nothing like economic decline\nto precipitate the smashing of a third\nworld regime, and that we only had to\nlook back at the Falklands to see the\nreadiness to beat the war drum.\n'Massive economic forces' were behind\nthis war as the result of the 'Open door'\npolicies drawn up by the US at the turn\nof the century which stated that all\nobstacles to the expansion of the US\neconomy should be removed. This policy,\nMend-a Bake\nPETER THOMAS\nBICYCLE\nREPAIRS\nSALES\nAND ACCESSORIES\n4-6 Effle Road\nFulham, London SW6\n071-371 5867\nTD\naccording to Mr Livingstone, 'laid down\nthe pattern of US foreign policy' for the\nbest part of this century.\nThe present economic system meant\nthat 'the whole world supports the US'\neither directly or indirectly because of the\nneed to trade in dollars. The present\nproblems were signs of 'resistance' that\nare emerging, said Mr Livingstone.\nQuoting statistics, Mr Livingstone said\nthat 2 2 % of the world's population was\nnow in economic decline in real terms, as\ncompared to only 3 % in the 1960s and\n70s. Mr Livingstone went on to say that\n'eventually the Arab nations will be\nreunited, and it would be better to have\nthem as friends' and 'the Arabs will have\nto solve their own problems in their own way\u2014we can't solve them for them'.\nMr Livingstone was asked how he could\n'reconcile his views in the Middle East\nwith his support for Sinn Fein' to which\nhe replied that Sinn Fein had received\nthe overwhelming support of the Irish\npeople in the only free election that had\noccurred in Ireland this century. When challenged that Sinn Feinn supports the\nkilling of innocent people, Mr Livingstone\nreplied that he did not, but that every\nBritish government did.\nMr Livingstone was asked to what\nextent he thought that the Americans had\nplanned the war before the Iraqi invasion\nof Kuwait. He replied that he did not\nthink that it was premeditated because\nthe whole affair had the 'ingredients of a cock-up' and was an unexpected\nopportunity for the West to reassert its\ninfluence in the World.\nWhen asked why Neil Kinnock and the\nLabour front bench seemed to be toeing\nthe Tory line on the war he answered\nthat he could not comment because 'Neil\nhasn't spoken to me since 1986' but that\nhe had fared better than Tony Benn to\nwhom Neil Kinnock hadn't spoken since\nSabbatical\nElections\nThe election papers for the four\nsabbatical posts of Imperial College Union\nare going up this Monday. The posts open\nare President, Deputy President,\nHonorary Secretary and FELIX Editor.\nCandidates must have a proposer and a full list of second ers by Friday 1st March,\nwhen the papers come down. Hustings\nare on the 7th March and Elections on\nthe 11th and 12th. All prospective\ncandidates should come to the FELIX Office as soon as possible to discuss and\narrange their publicity requirements.\n1984.\nKen Livingstone finished by saying that\n'I'm not a fan of fundamentalism but I recognise its force as representing a ground swell of change amongst the\nordinary Arab people'.\nHe described Britain as 'the most\nbackward of all Western democracies\u2014a real backwater'. The only way to improve\nthe situation was to cut the ties with a heritage of a declining empire.\nHe described the 'special relationship'\nbetween Britain and the US as the ' PM licking the President's arse and getting a21 gun salute'.\nNational\nTheatre\nTrip\nThe National Theatre opens its doors to\nstudents on Wednesday 20th February.\nThe trip will involve a backstage tour\nof the three theatres and will leave Beit\nQuad at 5.00pm.

    "content": "Rufus Isaacs and Fizz Marsh report on Saki-Winki and Bearded Sakis from Kurupukari on the Essequibo.\nU Expedition Guyana '90\nThe Guyana '90 Expedition was born two\nyears ago when a poster appeared on the\nLife Sciences noticeboard saying, 'Anyone\nwant to go to Brazil?'. It was an\nopportunity far too good to miss,\nalthough the Brazilians were less than\nkeen to have seven biologists witnessing\nthe treatment of their forests. So we\nplumped for Guyana, a tiny country, also\nin the Amazonian Basin, north of Brazil,\nwhich is 8 0 % rainforest. Guyana'90 was\nan ecological conservation minded\nexpedition to study the flora and fauna of\nthe tropical forests. No one seemed to\nhave studied the forest there since David\nAttenborough in 1957, and earnest\norganisation for the trip began.\nFirst stop was an overnight stay in\nTrinidad, our introduction to the laid back\nCarribean life, rum punch, calypso,\nmosquitos and mind-numbing heat. Next\nmorning, a quick flight took us over the\ncoast of South America. Trees stretched\neverywhere beneath us, except where the\nsnaking brown rivers cut through the\ndense green carpet; a breathtaking first\nglimpse of what was to become our\nhome.\nWe took a taxi from the airport into\nthe capital (and only) city, Georgetown,\nwhere 8 0 % of the Guyanese people live.\nHe took us into the hubbub of\nGeorgtown's market square. Here, full of\nexcitement and a naive wonder at the\nforeign surroundings, we watched in\nstunned disbelief as a defenceless old man\nwas robbed of his bag by a teenage thief\nwho leaped just out of his reach, laughing\nwith the crowd who stood by. Water\nStreet, we found out later, was not a place to go shopping alone. Going out\nanywhere alone or at night was a bad\nidea, as 'whit ies' were sitting ducks for\nthe bandits. During a pleasant evening\nstroll in the tropical air on the first night,\nfour of us were robbed by a couple of\nbroken bottle waving yo bs. While we\nwere in Georgetown we saw very few\nEuropeans on the streets.\nPart of the reason for the tense\natmosphere is the very unstable political\nsituation, as most of the population are of\nEast Indian descent, but governed by\nWest Indians, unsympathetic to their\nneeds. The Peoples National Party\ngovernment have been accused of ballot\nrigging in the past, and the people are\ndemanding free and fair elections this\ntime. Riots and racial friction are\nincreasing as the elections, due any time,\napproach.\nThe city itself, once a corner of the\nCommonwealth, still retains much of the\npast; the statue of Queen Vic, the grand\nbuildings of the High Court and St\nGeorges Cathedral and rattling Morris\nMinors. Almost every building in Guyana\nis wooden and on stilts, as the land is\nmostly beneath sea level and prone to\nflooding. In the city centre, impressive\nSt\nFELIX\nelaborate whitewashed houses several\nstories high line the broad Parisian-style\nstreets with grassy central walkways,\nshaded by scarlet flowering flame trees.\nThe rich suburban areas along the sea\nwall contrast strikingly with the poorer\nquarters where muddy pothole d roads\nthread through the rundown shacks and\nchildren play around stagnant drains and\ndecaying rubbish heaps.\nHaving expected to be at our study site\nwithin a week, the problems we had\norganising food, equipment, permission\nand transport delayed departure a second\nweek. The smiling Guyanese officials\nwanted to help, but their inbred love of\nred tape and bureaucracy was a constant\nobstacle to progress. In between daily\nmeetings we were invited to teach at\nlocal schools. At primary schools, we\nshouted to be heard above the clam our of\nhundreds of chattering children, drawing\na tree with monkeys, snakes and parrots\nto illustrate our talk on very basic\nrainforest ecology.\nDeparture day dawned on the 17th October and we headed for our\ndestination, Kurupukari, 200 miles south\nof Georgetown on the Essequibo River,\nwhere, we were real i ably informed a pontoon would carry us across the river.\nWe travelled in a Toyota Landcruiser\ndriven by the mad Rastafarian, Mr\nBaptiste, who insisted on stopping for\nseveral beers before breakfast and\nlaughed and swore riotous ly for the entire\njourney. The equipment was packed into\na Mercedes U nimo g lorry with huge\nwheels, looking like it could get\nanywhere through anything. Our driver,\nElvis, held the land speed record for the\njourney, and he was warning us how bad\nthe journey was. None of us believed\nhim.\nThe 200 miles to Kurupukari took a tortuous nine hours. Houses turned to\nfields and as the tarmac ended and the\nforest began a feeling of great excitement\ngripped us all. This was what we had\ncome to see. The cruiser went in front\nwhile the U nimo g lumbered behind,\nsqueezing between the trees which hugged the narrow road and poked their\nbranches through the windows. The most\nserious obstacles were the swamps. Both\nvehicles got stuck and we had to wade in\nthe mud to clear logs and attach the\nwinch before they could be freed.\nEventually a shell-shocked team fell\nfrom the vehicles into a small clearing at\nthe edge of the Essequibo at Kurupukari.\nThere was no village and no pontoon\n(dismay!). The site was occupied by the\nCanadian Youth Challenge International\ngroup (YCI), who told us that the pontoon\nhad been broken for two years, but there\nwas an Amerindian settlement across the\nriver.\nWell, we chatted to the YCI gang, then\nwent for our first blissful swim. We were\nassured that the Pirhana only came out at\nnight, but something bit a hole in a swimming c ozzie! We staggered around\ntrying to cook dinner in an exhausted\nst up our, and in the end strung up our\nhamm ocs for our first night beneath the\nstars.\nThe following day, we had our first\nencounter with the Amerindians. Jonas, a short, dark triangular torso ed man with\nwiry dark hair and a solemn expression\npaddled some of us across the river to\nsearch for a study site. Alighting by some\nbeautiful rapids, our guide led us up a small grassy hill through lime trees and\ncoconut palms to the village. This\ncomprised of several wooden palm-thatched huts on stilts, seemingly\noccupied by only a few chickens. We were met by Captain Andrez, the 68 year\nold boss of the village. A bright eyed,\nround faced, loquacious man who\nwelcomed us eagerly. He took us to the\nsmall wooden stilted school building, built\nby Operation Raliegh in 1988, unused\ndim and the air relatively cool. It was\nincredibly silent, the atmosphere soothing\nand secure, the ancient grey trunk ed trees were the epi to my of complete\nserenity. The only sounds were the\nwhistling and calling of the birds above,\nthe periodic squawk of macaws, the\nbuzzing of wasps and the helicopter whir\nof the Hermit humming birds that darted\naround, sometimes only inches from our\nfaces.\nWe saw several species of monkeys,\noften disturbing their feeding and seeing\na rustling branch in the canopy. With\nmuch patience, their bright orange, long\nhaired bodies could be viewed as they\nmoved slowly and carefully between\ntrees. The extremely rare Black Spider\nMonkeys were even more timid. Although\ninitially inquisitive, they seemed to\nevaporate into the leaves once disturbed.\nIn contrast, Capuchins were obstreperous\ncreatures, screeching and swinging from\ntree to tree throwing debris down to\nsince the government had not provided a teacher. After a couple of hours looking\nat possible campsites in the forest, we\ndecided to stay in the schoolhouse and\nwalk in to the forest every day to work.\nDawn started each day with the distant\nroaring of the Howler Monkeys shouting\nacross the mist shrouded tree-tops. The\nmammal trappers would go off before\nbreakfast to check their traps. Things\nweren't always easy; mammals were\nelusive and not inclined to be trapped.\nThis was all rather conducive to nervous\nbreakdown but fortunately Jacuzzis in the\nrapids and the delight of wandering\nthrough the virgin forest in our spare\ntime kept us sane.\nHuge buttressed trees, towered\nmajestically straight up into the dense\ncanopy. Thick woody vines spiralled\naround branches and trunks. Here and\nthere a tree had toppled over slightly, still\nheld up by other trees and creepers, but\nletting shafts of sunlight sparkle through\nthe green. Otherwise the light was quite\nchase us away. We also caught sight of\nlarge troupes of Squirrel Monkeys, or\nSaki-Winki, and Bearded Sakis.\nThe Amerindians were very hospitable;\nAugustine, the master fisherman would\nbring us fish each morning from the\nprevious night's moonlit hunt. Other\nvillagers brought us sweet bananas,\nrefreshing coconuts, berries and fresh\nlemons and limes. We ate like kings and\nonly resorted to eating rodents\noccasionally! Even the children, who\nwere initially terrified of our strange\nwhite skin, soon greeted us shyly,\noffering rats and insects which they had\ncaught, to help us with our studies. They\nalso let us in on their tree secrets, sniffing\nbark and snapping twigs to identify them,\nsometimes offering gems of stories about\nthe medicinal or food uses of the plants.\nWe became especially close to Captain\nAnd rez \u2014 known as Captain because of his\nunquestionable knowledge of the river.\nHe passed us very early every morning\non his way to the fields beyond the\nschool, where crops of cassava, yams,\npeas and sugar cane were tended by the\nvillagers. He would often visit us for\nbreakfast on Sunday (his only day off) or\nin the evenings when he could be\npersuaded to take a shot of rum, which made him even more talkative than\nusual. A very religious man, of high\nmorals, the Captain had an opinion about\neverything, from the trivial e.g. a woman with a first toe longer than the others will\nmake a bossy wife, to the deeply\nphilosophical, 'No matter how hard they\nlook, scientists will never find God'. He\ntalked endlessly on history, politics, war,\nscience, farming, conservation, love and\nreligion with astounding knowledge,\nconsidering he didn't even have a radio\nand poses sed no books. He would\ninvariably end up on the subject of the\nnew road from Brazil which was planned\nto run past Kurupukari cutting through\nthe forest to the coast, and was reputedly\nprogressing rapidly at a rate of 10km a week, much to the Captain's obvious\ndismay. He loathed Brazilians and was\nappalled at the prospect of the road and\nthe havoc it would bring to his peaceful\nvillage.\nAfter three weeks at Kurupukari, we\nmet with a team from the Ministry of\nAgriculture and Wildlife, who were\nsurveying the Black Caimen population\n(very big alligators with sharp teeth\nwhich we weren't scared of at all!). They\nwarned us that the imminent November\nrains could leave us stranded beyond the\nimpassable swamps. The Captain\nconfidently predicted from the colour of\nthe moon's halo that the rains would\ncome late, if at all this year. In fact,\nspending Christmas with the Amerindians\nwas quite inviting, but after much debate\nwe decided for safety's sake to pack up\nand wade,through the swamps to drier\nforest. After getting settled into life at this\nidyllic site it was hard to leave, after the\nlast swim and final farewells we\nclambered back onto the Landcruisers\nand headed for the next camp.\nv Site 2, at a place called Mim u, was set\nin a white sandy clearing, by an ice-cold\nmagenta coloured creek. The land was\nowned by Demerrara Woods Timber Co.,\nwho operate small-scale selective felling.\nA team of their foresters who lived in a palm-thatched hut by the creek, helped us\nbuild shelters from wood and tarpaulin,\nusing the ubiquitous, razor sharp\ncutlasses\u2014one for hammocks, the other\nas a kitchen/communal room. We were\nsoon back into the routine of work, with\nhelp from the Guyanese wildlife team.\nMonkeys were arguably more abundant\nhere and we definitely saw more snakes\n(no fatalities though). Our nearby creek\nwas found to be the night time haunt of a young Spectacled Caimen which we\ndisturbed one evening. Fresh footprints\non the road each morning prompted\nnight-time searches for Jaguars, but they\nsensibly kept out of sight. Signs of tapir,\ndeer, anteater, agouti and labb a were also\nseen on our travels.\nBeing next to the jungle track, we were\noften visited by passing travellers,\nparticularly 'pork knockers'. These\nwandering gold and gem prospectors,\ngetting their interesting name from their\nsurvival on bush pig meat which they\ntende rise by bashing with hammers. They\nlive a rough life, always on the scrounge\nfor food and tobacco and always ready to\nstrike a deal. Notorious for their sticky\nfingers they set the camp on edge when\nthey arrived and often left in the dead of\nnight, sometimes with more than they\ncame with the price of their raw gold was\ntoo good to pass up and we each bought\na pennyweight\u2014enough for one ring.\nAbout a week into our stay at Miku, we\nsaw the first traffic from Brazil pass by,\nindicating that the new road had been\ncompleted. It was disturbing to imagine\nthe changes to Kurupukari where we had\nbeen so recently.\nAfter another ten days, the November\nrains began, in infrequent showers, but\nbecoming daily more fast and furious.\nOur last few evenings were spent\nfrantically digging gutters to divert the\ntorrents. On the last night, the weight of\nwater collected in the roof and split a massive hole in the tarpaulin, convincing\nus that it was time to leave.\nWith both vehicles piled high with\nbodies and equipment, we slipped our\nway back towards Georgetown, sorry to\nleave our beautiful home, but looking\nforward to a hot shower and cold beer.\nAfter seven weeks in the forest, the\nunfamiliar sights of buildings and crowds\nof people turned Georgetown into a Manhattan in our eyes. Mirrors, running\nwater, toilets, walls, ceilings, doors and\nstairs, beds, pavements and traffic all\nseemed bizarre. The culture shock was\neased a little by a night in an air-conditioned hotel with a superb meal, but\nit still took some time to adjust.\nGeorgetown seemed like a different city\nnow that we had Guyanese friends to\ntake us around. We went raving at\nreggae street parties and clubs, squeezing\nin with wild dancing locals. Shopping for\nsouvenirs at markets, we now paid\nGuyanese prices, often half what we\npreviously paid.\nMark Johnson, who masterminded\nGuyana '90 is already organising\nexpeditions for 1992 to Guyana and\nTrinidad. We strongly advise anyone who\nis interested and doesn't mind snakes,\ncrocodiles, pir hana or nasty skin invading\nparasites (didn't tell you about that one)\nto jump at the chance of being involved.\nDIARY DATE: The Guyana'90 will be\ntelling their story with slides on the\nevening of Feb 21, in Beit W2/3.

    "content": "Roland Flowerdew uncovers a barking vicar, a potato inspector\nand a man who thinks he's Robin Hood.\nEccentrics\n'Are you eccentric? If you think you are,\nor know someone who may be, contact\nDr David Weeks at the Royal Edinburgh\nHospital.' This message was on cards\ndisplayed around Edinburgh, when Dr\nWeeks decided to investigate eccentrics\nand eccentricity in 1984.\nHis ultimate aim was, and still is, to\nlook at the thought processes of\nschizophrenics, whose brains seem to\nfunction in a sort of secret code,\nintelligible to no-one but themselves.\nInstead of jumping in at the deep end, Dr\nWeeks tackled the lesser, but equally\ninteresting, problem of eccentrics.\nWhat makes an eccentric eccentric? An eighteenth century Scots laird suddenly\ndecided to take to his bed. A couple of\nyears later, he heard that Bonnie Prince\nCharlie had landed in Scotland,\nwhereupon he jumped to his feet\ndeclaring 'I 'll arise the noo'. He was later\nfound in bed between two nubile serving\nwomen, who, he said, were simply to\nkeep him warm. There is the case of the Englishman\nwho decided to corner the rice market in\nSan Francisco. To further this end, he\nbought up the entire rice stocks of the\ncity, with the intent to sell it at a profit\nlater. Unfortunately, several clippers\ncarrying rice sailed into the harbour, so\nthe bottom fell out of the market.\nSuffering from shock, he declared himself\nemperor of the United States of America.\nThe cards displayed around Edinburgh\ngenerated newspaper, then radio and\ntelevision interest in eccentricity, which enabled a large number of people to hear\nabout the investigation. This technique is\nknown as multi-media sampling.\nSimultaneously, Dr Weeks used the 'snow-ball' method, where friends are asked to\nask other friends if they know any\neccentrics. The other friends ask their\nfriends and so on, until a whole chain is\nbuilt up. Over two years, these two\nmethods asked an estimated 30 million\npeople in Britain whether they were, or\nknew any eccentrics. This sampling figure\nis only exceeded by the national census\nin scope.\nSome have questioned the validity of\nthese selection methods, saying that they\nare unscientific and open to abuse. This is\npartly true; however, Dr Weeks needed\nto locate eccentrics, rather than conduct\nan opinion poll. The fact that his sample\nsize was so large means that it is unlikely\nto be unrepresentative of the whole\npopulation.\nFollowing up the returns from this\nsurvey, Dr Weeks and his team came\nacross the following:\n\u2022 The man who invented the 'Balloon\nWire Strategic Defence Initiative'; a plan\nto surround Edinburgh with balloons\narmed with lasers connected to vibration\nsensors. His idea was that, in the event of\na nuclear strike, the lasers would neutral is e the radioactivity. However, the\nI same person has come up with other,\nmore practical, inventions.\n\u2022 The militarist, with 30 model tanks\nacross his living-room floor. He had taken\nto his bed to read books on military\nhistory. During the interview, he pulled\nout a hand grenade and asked\n'Frightened, de a rie?' \u2022 The vicar of a church in Berkshire, who\nbarks during sermons to liven things up.\n\u2022 The old lady who said 'I'm trying to\nbecome a cultivated enigma.'\n\u2022 Another old lady, who added another\nBeatitude to those given in the Sermon\non the Mount: 'Blessed are the cracked,\nfor they shall let in the light.'\n\u2022 The potato inspector, who eats nothing\nbut potatoes, and goes on potato holidays\nto Peru.\n\u2022 The man who works for the Ministry of\nDefence. However, in his spare time he\nidentifies with Robin Hood, to such an\nextent that he walks around complete\nwith bow and arrow, and dressed in\nLincoln green.\nWhat distinguishes these people from\nthe 'man-in-the-street'? The study found\nthat eccentrics are enormously creative,\nand many have vivid dreams. Although\nthey know that the rest of the world\nconsiders them peculiar, they have the\nself-confidence to ignore others. This non-conform is m means that they are\nremarkably free from stress, which in\nFEATURES\nturn means that they are incredibly\nhealthy: the average eccentric visits his\ndoctor twenty times less frequently than\nhis 'normal' compatriot.\nEccentrics usually start becoming\neccentric fairly early in life, from about\nseven years old and upwards. Frequently\ntheir parents are or were fairly strong\ndisciplinarians, but this may be because of\nthe behaviour of their children. There is\noften a history of eccentricity in the\nfamilies of eccentrics.\nEccentrics are also extremely curious\nand highly motivated. Although some of\ntheir ideas may be 'wacky', many could\nbe put to good use, but only if people\nstop dismissing them as being stupid.\nEccentrics feel invisible to the rest of the\nworld - for much of the time they enjoy\nthis, because it allows them to get on\nwith their lives without much interference. However, people tend to\noverlook them as contributors to the\nbenefit of mankind. This they find\nirritating, because one of the main\nmotivations for an eccentric is to improve\nthe lot of others. They often feel that\nthey are ahead of their time and that the\nrest of the world is out of step with them.\nMost eccentrics are male, but the\nnumber of female eccentrics is increasing,\nprobably because of the increasing\nindependence of women. It seems that\nfemale eccentrics tend to become so later\nin life than the males: Dr Weeks found\nthat they tended to get married and raise\nchildren, then they 'get rid' of their\nhusbands and restart their lives with an\namazing burst of creativity.\nDr Weeks considers that society needs\neccentrics. Their ability to cast off\npreconceptions and ignore conventions\nmeans that they can produce radical\nideas which can be put to good use. He\nalso draws parallels between the high\noccurrence of eccentrics in Britain and\nBritish creativity. Over half the world's new commercially-adopted ideas and\ninventions come from Britain. He says\n'Eccentricity is essential if society is to\nhave a sufficient variability within itself to\nadapt successfully to changing conditions.'\nIZIT\n+\nHIPJOINTS\nFree before 9.45pm then \u00a32.50 or \u00a31 (Ents card)\nBAR TIL lam\nDISCO TIL 1.50am "
