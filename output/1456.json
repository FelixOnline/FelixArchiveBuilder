    "content": "DEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(FINANCE & SERVICES)\nThe DPFS is responsible for the day-to-day financial administration of\nthe Union. This person will spend a lot of time dealing with budgetary queries from clubs, the Faculty Unions and event organisers. You\nwould also collate and solicit student feedback about the Union\u2019s bars,\ncatering and shop to gauge how students would like to see things run.\nOne major part of this role is coordinating the Summer Ball (the preparations for Summer Ball 2008 actually started in November 2007)\nwhich is a great opportunity to unleash your creativity to make sure\nthousands of students have a brilliant time at our end of year bash. This\nmeans being involved in the process of selecting which bands will play,\nwhether you want fire-breathing entertainers or clowns wandering\nround and how many chocolate fountains there should be.\nI\n\u2019m a fourth year maths student, and have had\na great time here so far being involved in the\nCollege community. I\u2019ve been on the RCSU\nand Imperial College Hockey Club execs and\nalso been treasurer of both the MathSoc and RSM\nHockey Club, experiencing union finances and organising events too.\nThe most important consideration for the incoming\nDPFS this year has to be the aftermath of Phase 3-the\nredevelopment of the Union bars, somewhere I spend\na lot of my time. I\u2019m not going to promise expensive\nnewtechnology,howeverIdohavesomemoney-mak-ing ideas to subsidise student activities, and will also\nconcentrate on the steady improvement of the basics\nthat come up every year in these manifestos with your\ninput and feedback:\n1. Catering and Bars.\n\u2022 Provide a genuine and profitable alternative to the\nEastside Bar for eating, with table service and good\nfood.\n\u2022 Train and retain more student staff for an improved service at the new (and bigger) bars.\n2. Events.\n\u2022 Raise the profile of Metric, (the new dB\u2019s) with\nmore live performances like comedy and bands.\n\u2022 Organise good events with our neighbours at the\nRCA, RCM and American-Exchange Programmes.\n3. Increase revenue.\n\u2022 Develop and raise the profile of the conference\nrooms built in Phase 2 as a cheaper alternative to the\nCollege service during summertime.\n\u2022 Improve profitability of the union shops, for ex-ample, by encouraging clubs and societies to purchase\nclothing, including sports kits, and other paraphernalia through it. [250 WORDS]\nAndrew Bromfield\nI\nn my 3 years at Imperial I have been the treasurer for RAG, felix Business Manager as well\nas Senior Entertainments Officer for the Union - all jobs that require financial responsi-bilities. Many of the Union\u2019s commercial services\nareas need improving to match the standard set\nby the Phase 3 redevelopment. Utilising my experience in managing events, parties, clubs, festivals\nand Union nights (including the ACC Bar-Nights),\nI\u2019ll ensure the students of Imperial College can be\nproud of, and enjoy, their Union. I will:\nIntroduce U-Pay: A cashless payment system for\nUnion trading, using current college cards; an easy\nway to pay for everything at the Union shop, news-agent, bar or club. Think of it like an oyster card.\nImprove Bars: I will even work shifts behind the bar\nto better understand the job, developing further\nmeans improvement.\nReinvent the Catering service: I will bring back table service and ensure more effort is put into making fresh, tasty food, concentrating on quality.\nCommercialise Phase 3:\nThis extra revenue will be used to subsidise Union\nactivity during the academic year.\nSummer Ball back to the students! I aim to push\nback the Summer Ball, making it more accessible to\nthose with exams, and create a Ball Committee to\nhelp bring a student focus.\nImprove Entertainments: I will encourage more student based activities and emphasis on Student DJs.\nListen to your Ideas: I will hold a monthly Services\nForum to gather YOUR input and comments about\nUnion services.\nRavi Pall\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION)\nThe DPE is responsible for coordinating and training the representation network, which includes all\nof the academic reps, and holding regular academic forums to gather student opinion about issues\nrelated to their course. They will sit on a number\nof college committees including those relating to\nboth undergraduate and postgraduate education,\ne-portfolios, careers and the student experience.\nTheir purpose for attending is to represent student views with the aim of making the academic\nexperienceatImperialoneofthebestintheworld.\nC\noursework feedback is still a long way\nfrom where it must be. I will continue to\nwork on this issue and persuade College\nto take this issue more seriously, guaranteeing more, quicker, constructive feedback.\nCan\u2019t get on a computer to work because someone is gaming or watching iPlayer, but don\u2019t feel you\ncan ask them to leave? I will work to make sure that\nin busy times, computers are only used for people\nto get on with the work they need to do.\nI will work to improve the quality of lecture notes.\nHandwritten, badly-photocopied notes will be a\nthing of the past.\nFor a long time we have said that the degree classification system in this country doesn\u2019t work. Is a\n2:1 from Imperial College equivalent to a 2:1 from\nsome other universities? We know it isn\u2019t, but the\njob market disagrees. I will spend a lot of my time\ntalking with companies, convincing them that\nsomeone with a 2:2 from Imperial has the ability to\nsucceed in the workplace\nSOLE has no soul! By the end of my sabbatical\nyear, SOLE will work. You will see bigger, faster\nchanges based on your opinions.\nFinally, I will work with College to bring back the\ndiversity in the number of Humanities options.\nBenjamin Stubbens\nH\ni, my name is Meera Ganeshadevan\n(GAN-NA-SHA-DAVE-AN) and you\nmay know me as the extremely little,\nloud Sri Lankan. I come from North\nWest London and study Chemistry and Management. I am tremendously friendly and believe this\nis a quality needed as your DPE, as your views can\nbe resonated through me. As a student not only\nbelonging to the Chemistry Department but the\nManagement Department also, I feel as though\nI have seen how different departments deal with\nthe problems faced about our educational needs\nand wants.\nI do not have a lot of experience in the education sector as such, but who has? Being a student\nand knowing the needs and wants of the fellow\nstudent body I feel is enough experience for me\nto be an exceptional DPE.If I am elected as DPE\nI aim to integrate the departments at Imperial\nmore to increase communication. I also will attempt to enforce a READING WEEK midterm as\na break is required whether it be a week or just a\nfew days, in which all departments are closed. I\nalso want to promote the credibility of a 2.2 from\nImperial to both students and employers. A big\npart of our education at Imperial is SOLE evaluated however I believe SOLE is not used enough\nby the student body and I would like to reevaluate\nhow this could be improved upon\u2026..would you\ndo SOLE for better incentives?

This admirably focused on the position of women\nin science, posing the rhetorical ques-tion, \u201cDoes science have a gender?\u201d In\nso male dominated a field as science,\nthe position of women is rightly of\nconcern with a minority voice which\ncan be easily drowned out. It is something to be proud of that in our coun-try, in our university, we believe in the\nequality of women with men. But if\nthe cry for women\u2019s rights must at\ntimes fight to be heard even here,\nin the Democratic Republic of\nCongo it reaches barely a\nstrangled whisper\nin the midst of\nthe deadliest\nconflict since\nWorld War Two,\nwhich engulfs a shattered and forgotten nation.\nIn the grip of a vicious civil war, the\nstatistics on the region can be overwhelming \u2013 5 million have lost their\nlives since 1998 and many millions\nmore have been displaced in a conflict\nwhich is still ongoing. But one of the\ngreatest tragedies in the country has\nbeen the intense, almost scientific assault on the rights of\nwomen and\ngirls. Rape has\nbecome, quite\nsimply, a weapon of war; to date\nover half a mil- lion\nrapes have been perpetrated.\nToday there will be 40 committed\nin the South Kivu, in the east of the\ncountry, alone: rapes which are carried\nout in the most unimaginable of ways.\nWomen and children are left defenceless as men flee their villages from attacking rebel forces that enact a brutal\n\u2018revenge\u2019 on the people for the Congolese Army\u2019s increasing clamp down.\nLeft to the mercy of madmen, women and girls as young as nine can expect rape, often gang rape, from which\nmany will simply not survive.\nThose who do, live less than enviable\nlives. Survivors are sometimes kept as\nsex slaves and young boys as child soldiers or slave labour in the country\u2019s\nlucrative diamond and uranium mines.\nThere have been 2,000 reported (not to\nspeak of the many more unreported)\ncases of women being kept as domestic and sex slaves for up to two years.\nWith utter disregard and disgust for\nwomen, rebel forces have\nbecome increasingly\nviolent with their\nreprisals, resulting\nin a horrific recent\ntrend and deliberate form of ethnic\ncleansing when the\nrebels find a pregnant\nwoman. Taking bets\non the sex of the foe-tus, they slice the\nwoman open, killing mother and\nchild, thus deciding\nthe winner.\nThis is, without doubt,\nthe world\u2019s forgotten war.\nThe UN has called for\npeace keeping troops\nbut has found countries unwilling to\ncontribute. The distance from one side\nof the country to the other\nis greater than the distance\nfrom London to Moscow and\nyet the country has just\n20,000 UN troops leaving\nthe task of patrolling one\nof the worst hit regions,\nSouth Kivu, the equivalent to a single police officer patrolling\nParis and Brussels combined.\nThe failure of the poorly trained UN\nforce is undeniable, with many of the\ntroops being accused of rape them-selves. And yet when Ban Ki Moon\ncalled on Europe to send its own\nforces, we looked away. Without pro-fessional, unbiased troops protecting\ntheir villages, the Congolese women\nsimply don\u2019t stand a chance.\nAlongside the belief that women and\nmen are equals marches the belief in\nequality of all human beings, every-where. Trouble in the Middle East has\nbeen enough to bring whole armies\nRoryFenton\nRoryFenton\npouring in and the undivided attention of the world, as well as many column inches in this paper. The last time\ndeath on this scale appeared in the\nworld we were engaged in a war that\ncame close to being the end of us.\nBut this is not in the East or in our\nbackyard and we arrive at the acid\ntest of our belief in equality; will the\nhorrors committed against women\ngo unchecked, wherever they are\ncommitted?\nWalk for Women, a march in memory of the suffragettes Mud March of\nThe UN in Congo\nOver 20,000 uniformed UN\npersonnel are stationed in\nCongo.\nCurrent annual budget of\n$1.35m.\nThe UN remains in Congo\ndue to the legacy of the war\n(1998-2003) which killed at\nleast 4m people .\nThis\nweek\nLord Ashford admits\nnon-dom status\nLord Ashford, the Deputy-Chair of the Conservative party, has admitted\nthat he is non-demiciled\nfor tax purposes in the\nUK. This means that he\ndoes not pay taxes on\nmoney he earns over-seas- the majority of his\nincome. When he was\nmade a Lord in 2000\nhe said he would \u201ctake\nup residence in the UK\u201d. Labour claims that he promised to\npay full UK tax. Lord Mandelson had called for a probe to be\ntaken into his actions, but these calls were rebuffed as the\nrelevant comission doesn\u2019t have retrospective powers. Lord\nAshford is the single largest Tory donor.\nTelevised leaders\ndebates agreed on\nThe BBC has conducted a survey of 49\ncouncils which has\nsuggested possible job\ncuts of 10%. The councils questioned employ\n256,000 people. Possible areas for cuts include nurseries, road\nworkers and libraries.\nWhile undoubtedly\nsavings need to be made in budgets everywhere, Labour have\nsaid that efficiency improvements need to be made but services don\u2019t need to be cut. This is in contrast with the views of\nthe councils questioned, 70% of whom believe they need to\ncut between 5 and 20% of their workforce. If all councils cut\n10% of workers 180,000 would lose their jobs.\n25,000 council jobs\nare threatened\nGordon Brown, David\nCameron and Nick Clegg\nhave now agreed the details for the first ever televised debates between\nthe leaders of the major\nparties.

These were even\nmore popular than they\u2019ve been in\nprevious years due to the intense publicity build-up. On Tuesday there was\na fabulous concert by the Sinfonietta\nin the Main Entrance, and the evening\nsaw the opening of a joint exhibition\nof Leosoc and Photosoc (and, in fact,\nKnitsock contributed too) which ran\nfor the rest of the week, which was\nhighly praised by the gallery\u2019s curator.\nWednesday, traditionally left free\nfor those who don\u2019t get their kicks on\nthe playing field to enjoy a whole afternoon of getting stuck into artistic\npursuits, was the fullest day. Not only\nwas there a double concert by Windband and Classical Guitars at lunchtime but also three simultaneous\nworkshops to choose from - Dramsoc, Belly dancing or singing with Imperial\u2019s popular a Capella male voice\nchoir, The Techtonics. To round off,\na barn Dance was held in the Union\nConcert hall.\nThursday was reserved for the spectacular showcase featuring acts of all\ntypes but especially clubs who showed\noff an extra twist to their traditional\nrepertoire like the string ensemble\u2019s\nvideo game-inspired music. Although\nthe Showcase was definitely a success,\nit was deemed disappointing by organisers that fewer than 1000 people,\nfrom the entire university, turned out\nfor the biggest arts\u2019 event of the year.\nFinally, with the week roaring to a\nclose, another joint lunchtime concert of the string ensemble (who had\nappeared naked in that morning\u2019s fe-lix) and Musical Theatre Society. The\nevening ended with jamming and a\nmusic Tech night in dBs and an Indie\ndisco.\nThroughout the week, there was also\na developing collage for all students to\ncontribute to in the Sherfield building,\nand busking and flash-performances\nthroughout campus. Contributors were\nno doubt pleased, not only to raise the\nprofile of their enthusiasms and indeed\ntalents, and also to begin the end of\nterm concert season in style. The coming weeks will see numerous concerts,\nshows and even more workshops for anyone whose interest has been re-ignited.\nPlans for Artsfest 2011 can now begin in earnest; the Showcase is already\nbooked and elections for the committee\nstart next week. Everyone who wants to\nform the next incarnation of the annual\nevent is encouraged to stand and the\noutgoing committee is to be congratulated on their prominent success.\nPolitics\np\np\np\nFilm\n\n"

    "content": "SABBATICAL ELECTIONS 2010\nPRESIDENT\nThe Union President is ultimately responsible for the direction of\nthe Union, all Union activity and its finances. Tasks vary from simple\nthings such as having a broken vending machine replaced to managing a multimillion pound project such as refurbishing the Union\u2019s\nbars. The President sits on numerous committees within College as\nwell as the Union and meets regularly with the Rector and other senior College staff to provide student input in decision making processes and to raise any immediate concerns that the student body\nmight have. The President also works closely with the Union\u2019s General Manager who is in charge of the Union\u2019s permanent staff.\nI\nwant to be President because I think that our\nUnion is great but can be so much better. Too\noften, the Union is seen as the building and\nthe bar; instead, we should think and talk of\nthe Union as the students. Too often the Union is\npassive, waiting for students to come to it and find\nout what it can do. I want the Union to become\nmore active in engaging itself with every student.\nInvolvement in some way should be the default, not\nthe exception.\nThe practical steps I propose to change this are\nthe following. Firstly, the year representation network should be entirely overhauled leading to train-ing, handbooks and support. Secondly, I will organise centralised publicity for clubs and societies in a\nprinted \u2018what\u2019s on\u2019 in every department, ensuring\nthat every student is aware of events. Thirdly, I will\ninvolve students more in the operation of Metric by\nmaking it easy for societies, sports clubs, and departments to organise club nights. Fourthly I want\nto encourage innovation so that anyone can bring\ntheir ideas to us, such as how we can make our own\nBiodiesel for the minibuses.\nI believe I have the experience and dedication to\nbe President as I have been involved on all sides,\nfrom clubs to representation \u2026 to occasionally\npropping up the bar.\nWhoever you vote for, remember to vote. The\nUnion is nothing but the students, but the students\nare more important than a building. Please visit\nalexkendall4president.blogspot.org.\nAlexander Kendall\nI\nwas inspired to run this year after being part\nof the Phase 3 working groups and Equal Opportunities Officer of the union. Through\nboth these roles, I\u2019ve had a chance to improve\nthe union, proposing changes for affiliate members\nfrom RCM and RCA as well as ensuring money is\nwell spent from the Representation and Welfare\nbudget. Next year, it is imperative the student experience is improved to match the fantastic facilities Phase 3 will offer us. Live music is a priority of\nmine. After all, what makes or breaks a venue more\nthan the acts which perform there? Our bar service\nmust be up to scratch. Whilst service has improved,\nbrand new bars mean customers expect better. We\nalso need to up our game when it comes to food.\nAlthough table service hasn\u2019t been implemented\nthis year, I still feel there are ways to improve the\nsystem as it is. My work with Equal Opportunities\nhas shown me that although our Welfare and Education Sabbatical officers work hard, many students\nhave no knowledge of the services available to them.\nThis is something I have strived to change this year,\npointing out the services available to those around\nme, but there\u2019s much more to be done. Within rep-resentation, great strides have been taken this year\nto properly assess representation from undergrad\nto postgrad and next year it\u2019s crucial that the holes\nare plugged and the student voice heard by the\ncollege, the most important function of a student\nunion.\nChristopher Darby\nA\ns a society founder, treasurer and active participant of numerous events at\nthe Union, in three years I have gained\na solid understanding of its internal operations and developed a wide range of contacts\nacross Imperial and various London universities.\nNow with your help I want to SPARK up the Union\nand make it a fun place to be:\nSUPPORT communication between the Union\nand clubs & societies with monthly progress meet-ings. As a president, I aim to improve club officers\ntraining by encouraging inter-club and inter-uni-versity communication in order to create a more\ninteractive community at Imperial.\nPROMOTE our new nightclub Metric. I plan to\ncollaborate with other student unions in order to\ninvite more London students to the renovated venues and raise its profile to that of LSE Crush and\nKings\u00b4 Phase.\nARRANGE regular live music events at the Union by working alongside the entertainments team.\nThis includes not just Friday night DJs, but live\njazz, blues and alternative rock performances.\nREFORM the mailing system for clubs & socie-ties. My plan is to create a single and centralised\ncalendar for all student organised events. This will\nkeep our mailing subscriptions to only clubs which\nwe truly commit to, whilst allowing us to check-up\non the variety of events taking place around college.\nKEEP UP the renovation of the new nightclub\nand bar during Phase III. My main priority would\nbe to ensure that the work is completed strictly on\ntime for Fresher\u2019s Week 2010.\nSerge Vasylechko\nH\naving been a hall senior in Beit since September, I have had plenty of opportunities\nto observe the activity at the Union and\ndifferent states of it, as well as having the\ngreat chance to interact with freshers in order to find\nout what their opinion of the Union as a whole is.\nFurthermore, having lived in three different kinds\nof halls, I have noticed the different influence of the\nUnion on each one, depending on location, size and\nstructure. Hence I believe that welfare is a particularly important aspect that must be available to eve-ryone, and especially freshers, regardless of where\nthey live.\nFinally, I have gained knowledge of internal operations by being a member of the Aikido club committee and through friends who are deeply involved with\nUnion affairs at the moment.\nBased on this, my primary objectives, if elected as\npresident, are:\nUNION BUILDING- Extensively oversee and lead\nthe union redevelopment project to a conclusion before the beginning of next academic year\nNEW VENUES- Create a strong image for the new\nbar and nightclub from day one, namely liaising with\nthe media and performing arts clubs and inviting\nlive acts to perform regularly at Metric (former dBs)\nwhile keeping the prices to a minimum\nWELFARE/COMMUNICATION -Improve communication between students and the Union by introducing a continuous evaluation system similar to\nSOLE, where the committee members of Clubs &\nSocieties and the wardening teams in Halls would\nensure that feedback is provided promptly.\nStanislav Tarasov\n\n"

    "content": "11\nfelix FRIDAY 05 MARCH 2010\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk POLITICS\nWhat will it mean if the UK votes in a hung parliament at the general election?\nThe polls are narrowing. The lead the\nTories have over Labour has now diminished to the point where a hung\nparliament has become increasingly\nlikely. In order for the Tories to obtain\nan overall majority, they require one of\nthe largest swings in British electoral\nhistory, and since the new-year the\nchances of this have started to slip.\nIf there is a hung parliament it could\nbe more than problematic. Only a cursory glance at how well the three major\nparties get along should show the problems there would be if they had to co-operate. Labour and the Conservatives\nwould not be able to work together to\nhelp fix the economy, their policies are\njust too different. The country would\ngrind to a standstill as no votes could\nbe passed in the House. This could be\ndisastrous at a time when the nation\u2019s\nfincances are so delicate.\nA hung parliament would leave the\nLib Dems as the so called \u2018king makers\u2019. It would be up to them to decide\nwho they wanted to work with, and\nas a result, choose who would be the\nnext Prime Minister. However, the Lib\nDems have said that they are not inter-JamesLees\nJamesLees Politics Editor\nested in taking this role, and that the\nparty with the clearest mandate should\nform the government.\nHowever, as is far too often the case\nwith the Lib Dems this is an impractical idea. If no party takes an overall\nmajority, and no coalition is formed\nthen the incumbent government re-mains. Gordon Brown would remain\nthe Prime Minister without being voted in by a majority of the public.\nOf course if the Lib Dems decided,\npost election, to form a coalition government then they would be acting\nagainst a policy they had been voted in\nfor. They are unlikely to do this, so the\nchance of a hung parliament remains\nhigh. To avoid a hung parliament any\nparty needs to win at least 326 seats,\nthe most in any election, due to boundary changes. For this to occur the Tories must gain 116 seats, and for Labour to lose their majority they would\nhave to lose 14 seats. Anything inbetween these figures would result in a\nhung parliament. For the Lib Dems to\nwin a majority would require a miracle.\nWhether you like the Conservatives\nor not, I find it difficult to believe that\nmany people still have faith in the Labour party and the dangers of a hung\nparliament should be obvious to see.\nWhat\u2019s a hung\nparliament?\nHappens when no party has\nan overall majority of seats in\nthe house of commons.\nHas not happened in the UK\nsince 1974.\nAnother general election was\nheld the same year in order\nfor a significant majority to be\nobtained.\nCommon in countries with\nproportional representation\nsuch as Germany and Italy.\nMore people didn\u2019t vote at all\nthan voted for Labour in the\nlast general election.\n\n"

The would-never-be comedian, who may as well as\nhave a parental advisory carved onto his\nforehead cautioning extreme dullness,\nuttered his funniest expression yet.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cThe battle the Duke of Wellington\nwon against Napoleon \u2013 that was Waterloo, not Trafalgar.\u201d\n\u201cDid I\u2026what?\u201d\nAwkward silence.

It\u2019s easy to substitute both with radically cheaper options.\nVisit Rangitoto Island, just off the coast\nof the city, and climb up to the summit\nof the dormant volcano to absorb a much\nmore gobsmacking panorama, free of\ncharge (ignoring the cost of the ferry, that\nis).

They represent\nstudents\u2019 welfare needs to College and external\norganisations, and sit on a number of College\ncommittees relating to welfare, accommodation,\nequal opportunities and the student experience.\nThey are also responsible for the activities of the\nUnion\u2019s Community Action Group and IC RAG.\nNOT SUBMITTED\nAlexander Norman\nI\n\u2019m Mike Richards, an east-ender and struggling physicist. I have no experience in the\nunion hierarchy I am a proper student. I find\nit difficult to get up for 9am lectures probably\nbecause I\u2019ve enjoyed far too much snakebite at the\nbar the night before. Every year people campaign\nto have a democratic union and this is the only way\nit can happen, by having someone who can shake\nup the establishment and bring our views to the\nuniversity.\nPrevious candidates have made grandiose pledges that whilst noble are simply un-implementable\nwithin the union. It is because of this I make these\nbasic pledges which will improve the welfare of the\nuniversity:\n\u2022Imperial always does poorly in student satisfaction poles. This won\u2019t change easily but a week of\nrefreshers events at the beginning of the 2nd term\nlike every other university wouldn\u2019t go a miss.\n\u2022Improve the buddy system something which\nmost fresher\u2019s in SOLE said they were unhappy\nwith.\n\u2022RAG & CAGt do fantastic jobs but we don\u2019t often hear about it. I want to give these groups more\npublicity and bigger projects.\n\u2022The disability advice service is an underused resource I want to get more people aware of it and\nusing it.\n\u2022The welfare service does a great role but people\ndon\u2019t know it\u2019s here. A regular article in Felix reminding people of what\u2019s available will solve this.\nSimple policies for proper students.\nMichael Richards\nI\n\u2019ve proved I can relate to students, older and\nyounger, through my position as a Hall sen-ior, from chilling with freshers, arranging and\npublicizing their events, to attending serious\ncommittee meetings with wardens. I feel it\u2019s time\nto take my experience to the next level.\nI\u2019m not going into this role with preset goals, I\nthink it\u2019s important to find out what your issues\nare first and form my work around them. Through\na solid welfare structure I will hopefully iron out\nproblems before they occur.\nLose the stigma! The DP (Welfare) job is a position with emphasis on contact with students and\nyet students find it hard to come forward. I plan\non reinventing the view people have of the Union\u2019s\nWelfare, so that it\u2019s not \u2018laaame\u2019 to come forward\nwith your problems.\nMore features in Felix! The more welfare issues\nare publicized campus wide; the more people feel\nencouraged to come forward, especially students\nwho live at home or international students who can\nfeel isolated from College life. I\u2019m going to up my\ncurrent involvement with felix and I will encourage\nactive debate on issues, like the proposed smoking\nban on campus.\nFace-to-face! Build relations with hall wardens\nand arrange meetings with freshers, so people are\nmore aware of where they can get help straight off\nthe bat.\nI combine a laid back attitude, which allows people to approach me with their issues without hesi-tation, with the gung-ho finesse to be pro-active in\nfinding them a solution.\nVictoria Masding\nRON FOR ALL POSITIONS\nWell, here we are. I\u2019ve been waiting for you. I\u2019m Tin-man RON (Re-open the Nominations) and I\u2019m running for every position at these elections. Why would a lowly\ntin-man run for every single election post you might ask? After all , I have no brain\nand my limbs can easily be ripped off my body. IT\u2019S BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THESE PAGES ARE A F*CKING JOKE. Seriously. If you think the same,\nwhich I hope you do, vote for tin-man RON.\nI maybe made out of tin foil but I\u2019d definitely do a better job than most of them.\nPresident? You\u2019ve got four bloody candidates and they\u2019re all useless as each oth-er. Seriously, we\u2019d rather just have Obama, and even he definitely no, he definitely\ncan\u2019t either.\nEducation? Welfare? I don\u2019t even know what those are. I came to Imperial College for a gashfest, not a degree!\nFinance & Services? The Union\u2019s fine. What\u2019s not to like about piss-beer, lots of\ndrunk men and the overriding smell of boredom?\nI can guarantee you that every single candidate going for DP (Clubs & Socs) are\nlying.

Broken nose.\nPool of blood. Brilliant start.\nJason made an early appearance and the\nRSM reshuffled but soon felt the wrath of\nCSMs left winger who slotted in after about\nten minutes. It was two soon after, when a deflected shot from outside the area beat our\ngoalkeeper Joe. CSM\u2019s dominance continued\nwhen it became 3-0 following a penalty\nafter Stuart hacked down their striker\nwho was certain to score.\nDespite strong support from\nthe RSM crowd and Howard, it\nwas soon 4 and the flood gates\nwere opened. They were good\nand despite Matt and Stuart\nputting in the yards in the\nmiddle of the pitch we were\npretty powerless. The tackling ranged from industrial to\nagricultural but the referee had left his cards\nat home.\nThen shortly before half time we made it\ninto their half. Jason\u2019s shot hit the bar and it\nbounced downwards but no goal was given.\nI\u2019ve heard reports that it was in (Bogdan) but\nthere was no russian linesman when we needed one most. Still I couldn\u2019t really see and I\nwouldn\u2019t like to speculate.\nAnyway at halftime it was 4-0 and we were\nstaring down the barrel.\nJon bravely returned with his beak in bits\nand Christian went for a tinny and a smoke.\nStuart turned to me in the middle and said\n\u201cRight Matt, let\u2019s see who can get a yellow card\nfirst.\u201d\nIt became apparent however that this would\nonly be possible should GBH or perhaps some\nminor stab wound be implemented.\nAnyway I digress.\nAn early highlight of the second half was a\nmidfield tussle tripping over the ref but then\nmore misery continued through further CSM\nscoring.\nJoe gave away his 3rd penalty of the season\nand it was five. Six and seven arrived shortly\nafter.\nWe didn\u2019t really have a sniff to be honest and\nthey were a very good side.\nAfter a decent season RSM sit 3rd in the\nleague table, whereby promotion is still\nimpossible\nA\nfter an 8 hour\nbus journey\nwe finally arrived in Penryn\nCollege for the\nfirst ever netball bottle match\n(and indeed our first game\never). We had been told that\nthe game was indoors, CSM\u2019s\nidea of this was an outdoor\ncourt inside what can only be\ndescribed as a tent.\nNeedless to say it was freez-ing. Despite this we started\nwarming up, trying hard to\nignore the 50 CSM players\non the other side of the court\n(the majority of whom were\nfairly large to be polite, wearing skirts not visible to the\nhuman eye).\nThe game started with RSM\ntaking the first centre. Solid\ndefence kept the ball out of\nCSM\u2019s attacking third for the\nmajority of the quarter and\nafter some unlucky shots and\ndetermination RSM scored\nthe first goal.\nAfter breaking the deadlock\nwe gained in confidence. McNugget moved to Goal Attack\nand shots started firing in\nwith CSM yet to even get past\ntheir attacking third line.\nBy this point in the match\nit was clear CSM were not\nas hard to banter and abuse\nas the RSM team, with their\nCentre being reduced to tears\nby the end of the second\nquarter.\nThe rest of the match continued with RSM dominat-ing. Despite some shocking\numpiring, RSM produced an\nuncatchable lead. Interceptions came all over the court\nand the goals started mounting up. CSM seemed to have\nforgotten the basic rules of\nnetball and sent the largest\ngirls ever to grace a netball\ncourt charging around the\npitch in an attempt to win the\nball. Skillful play from Rach\nas Centre and some solid defence meant that even with\ndodgy umpires CSM couldn\u2019t\ncatch up.\nThe game ended 15-4 to\nRSM making the RSM team\nundefeated Bottle Match\nwinners!\nAs agreed we were playing\nfor what was originally the\nLadies Rugby trophy which\nCSM have managed to cheat\naway from us for the last 2\nyears.\nAfter our captain collected\nthe trophy and we started\ncelebrating something pretty\nawful happened. The CSM\nteam jumped up onto the\nbenches and started doing a\nsong and dance.\nThe look of confusion and\nhorror on every RSMers face\nwas a picture. They obviously\nthought we had enjoyed it\nas at the presentation in the\nevening we got a special repeat performance.\nWell done to the RSM team\nfor a thoroughly deserved\nwin! Maybe CSM will be able\nto put up a better fight next\nyear but this is highly doubt-ful.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nScience Editors\nScience Editors Nathan Ley & Brigette Atkins\nNathan Ley & Brigette Atkins\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nfelix FRIDAY 05 MARCH 2010\nJames Goldsack\nJames Goldsack\nFusion energy production has got a\nstep closer according to new research\nrecently published. The controlled fusion of atoms has long been considered a possible revolutionary energy\nsource. However, doubts have been\nraised about the use of high energy\nlasers to obtain this due to the plasma\nthey create. The fear is that this plasma\ncould interrupt the fusion. An article\npublished in Science has shown that\nplasma is far less of a problem than\nexpected.\nThe report is based upon initial experiments from the National Ignition\nFacility in the US, using all 192 of its laser beams. The experiments also broke\nthe record for the highest energy from\na laser by a factor of 20. The facility at\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory took 12 years to construct and was\nonly completed in May 2009. In contrast to current nuclear power \u2013 fission\n\u2013 the facility\u2019s goal is the creation of a\ncontrolled thermonuclear explosion by\nharnessing the power of the largest laser ever built.\nProving that a fusion reaction in the\nlab can release more energy than is\nrequired for ignition could usher in a\nnew era of large-scale energy produc-tion. NIF uses a technique called inertial confinement fusion where the\ntarget is a centimetre-scale cylinder of\ngold called a hohlraum. This contains\na pellet of fuel made from deuterium.\nThe plasma that lasers will create in\nthe hohlraum was one potential hurdle\nto the success of the process. The fear\nwas that the plasma would interrupt\nthe absorption of energy by the target\nand disturb the uniform funnelling of\nthis energy, compressing and igniting\nthe target.\nSiegfried Glenzer led a team to test\nthis theory. \u201cWe hit it with 669 kilo-joules \u2013 20 times more than any previous laser facility\u201d. The experiments\nprovided proof that the plasma did not\ndisrupt the process, with about 95% of\nincident laser light being absorbed by\nthe hohlraum. Furthermore, Dr Glenzer\u2019s team discovered that the plasma\ncan be carefully manipulated to increase the uniformity of the compression \u2013 a key component for achieving\nignition.\n\u201cFor the first time ever in the 50-year\njourney of laser fusion, these laser-plasma interactions have been shown\nto be less of a problem than predicted,\nnot more,\u201d said Mike Dunne, director of the UK\u2019s Central Laser Facility\nand leader of the European laser fusion effort, HiPER. \u201cI can\u2019t overstate\nhow dramatic a step that is,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMany people a year ago were saying\nthe project would be dead by now.\u201d\nSince the publication in Science, the\npulse energy has been increased to one\nmegajoule onto the target, a further increase of 50%. The latest calculations\nshow that about 1.2 megajoules of energy will be enough to cause ignition\nand NIF has the capability to run up to\n1.8 megajoules.\nDr Glenzer said that experiments using slightly larger hohlraums with fuel\npellets, including a mix of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium as well as tri-tium, should commence before May\nbefore increasing the power gradually\nto 1.2 megajoules. \u201cThe bottom line is\nthat we can extrapolate those data to\nthe experiments we are planning this\nyear and the results show that we will\nbe able to drive the capsule towards ignition,\u201d said Dr Glenzer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to\nhappen this year.\u201d\nIs this a vision\nof the future?\nScience Editor\nA step closer for nuclear fusion\nJames Goldsack\nJames Goldsack\nScientists have now decided that\na strong cup of coffee could save\na life, after finding out that it can\nprotect the heart. This is the finding from US medical giant Kaiser\nPermanente\u2019s Division of Research\nin California, and it has found that\ncoffee in all doses can protect from\nheart disease. The study followed 130,054 men and women between the ages of 18 and 90 and found that those who drunk four\nor more cups of coffee per day had an 18% lower risk of hospi-talisation for heart rhythm disturbances. This however isn\u2019t good\nenough to prove cause and effect, even though it may offer some\nreassurance to people. A similar study from the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid in Spain showed similar results in that drinking\nthree cups of coffee a day could reduce the risk of women dying\nfrom heart disease by a quarter.\nAustin Sendek, a student at the University of California\nhas started a campaign to create a new prefix for describing quantities with a magnitude in the range of 1027\n. His online petition to call to allocate a prefix of \u2018hella\u2019 to\nthis figure already has the signatures of 20,000 scientists\nand members of the public. If introduced, it would be\nthe first new prefix brought in to use since 1991 when\nzetta and yotta became the official prefixes for 1021\nand\n1024\nrespectively. Professor Mills of the University of\nReading has promised to raise the petition at the next\nmeeting of the Consultative Committee for Units but in\na letter to Sendek said \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be received with\nsmiles - but I doubt it will go further.\u201d The main reason\nthe name is likely to be rejected is that prefixes such as\nzetta and yotta, brought in nearly 20 years ago, are still\nnot in common use and a new prefix at this stage will\nonly add to further confusion. Also, most prefixes stem\nfrom a Latin or Greek origin \u2013 rather than North Californian slang for \u2018a-lot-of.\u2019\nIf a new report from Imperial College and the\nUniversity of Surrey is\nto be believed, when\nit comes to achieving a\ncarbon-free UK, relying\non \u2018clean\u2019 electricity is not\nthe answer. According to\nthe report, the quest for clean electricity is likely to face\n\u2018critical challenges\u2019 as we see a switch from the use of fossil\nfuels to electricity in areas such as transport. The demand\nfor electricity has the potential to double over the coming\nyears meaning a significant increase in the number of low-emission power stations being built. A \u2018combined heat and\npower\u2019 approach has the potential to reduce electricity demand by 13% and cut fossil fuel consumption by 5%, the\nreport estimates.\nA new \u2018skinput\u2019 device is being developed by Carnegie Mellon University in\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania and researchers in Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Redmond, Washington.\nIt involves a combination of a microchip sized pico-projector (which creates\nthe changing display) and a sensor that\n192 lasers bombarded a small pellet of deuterium fuel with an energy twenty\ntimes that of any previous experiment.\nIn\nbrief\nThe naming of 1027 Waste heat solution Coffee protects heart\nA record-breaking experiment at the National Ignition Facility\nrestores faith in nuclear fusion through inertial confinement\nA video showing how \u2018skinput\u2019 can recognise a telephone number input\ncan tell which part of your body your\narm is tapping. This is based on the idea\nthat different skin locations are acoustically distinct due to bone density and\na filtering effect from soft tissues and\njoints. Software is then used to match\nsound frequencies (the complex longitudinal waveforms) to specific locations\non the skin. Different interactive capabilities can be bound to different loca-tions, and so you have a fully fledged\nsensor.\nThe idea behind this device is the apparent desire for people not to have to\ncarry around extra surfaces with them,\nespecially for inputs. The skinput device takes this idea and harnesses the\nintrinsic benefit of our own obligation\nto carry arms around with us. This being said, the prototype requires the user\nto wear an armband. However the hope\nis that the system could use wireless\nbluetooth technology to transmit the\ncommands to many types of devices\nsuch as phones, Ipods, and even PC\u2019s.\nAccuracies as high as 95.5% were\nable to be achieved at five different\nskin locations, which would supposedly be enough for several smartphone\napplications.\nThis would, however, need to be\nimproved to be able to feasibly go to\nmarket.\nTwenty volunteers tested the system\nand reported that it was easy to navigate\nthrough icons on the forearm and by\ntapping fingers to execute commands.\n\n"

    "content": "33\nfelix FRIDAY 05 MARCH 2010\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk TECHNOLOGY\nKeep your phone,\nsave some dosh\nJail time for Google\nexecs over Italian\nautistic abuse video\nWould you indict a postal worker for\ndelivering hate mail? Or jail an eyewitness to a crime for not having stopped\nit in the first place? To use the precedent set by a recent court ruling in\nItaly, you should.\nIn a shocking case of judicial incom-petence, three Google employees who\nwere involved in the identification and\nremoval of a particularly offensive video from Google Video have been sentenced to up to six months in jail for\ntheir \u2018crime\u2019. It\u2019s a puzzling story that\nbegan innocuously enough in 2006,\nwhen a video showing an autistic boy\nbeing bullied by his classmates was\nuploaded to Google Video, the Google\nequivalent of YouTube until Google\nbought and merged the two services.\nThe video was quickly removed after\nuser complaints (including one from\nthe Italian Interior Ministry), but has\nmanaged to morph slowly into yet another battle between Google and a national government.\nThe incident only serves as a reminder that few of the legal questions posed\nover the ownership and monitoring of\nmaterial on websites like Google Video, Facebook, etc., have actually been\nanswered. On September 8th 2006,\nthe video depicting the bullying was\nuploaded on Google Video, but was\nremoved within 24 hours; a rapid response considering the volume of content that Google Video has to monitor\ndaily. Google went one step further\nhowever, helping the Italian government identify those who recorded\nand uploaded the video. Ironically, the\nperpetrators of the attack weren\u2019t even\nsentenced to jail time, getting off with\n10 months community service. Then\nunexpectedly, in February 2009, four\nsenior Google executives were charged\nfor breaching the Italian privacy code.\nBizarrely, they had nothing to do with\nthe issue of the video until well after it\nwas removed. Among those charged\nwere Google\u2019s Chief Legal Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, people whose\njob titles suggest that they are in no\nway involved with actually managing\nGoogle Video. As Google\u2019s own legal\ncounsel bluntly put it, \u201cTo be clear,\nnone of the four Googlers charged had\nanything to do with this video.\u201d\nGoogle was initially hopeful that the\njudge would dismiss the case, seeing\nas those charged were being dragged\nunwillingly into a conflict they never\nshowed any interest in. The ruling\ncame as a surprise, and derives from a\ntechnicality in the Italian penal code,\nnamely the difference between an \u2018internet service provider\u2019 and an \u2018internet content provider\u2019. EU legislation\nstates that \u2018service providers\u2019 aren\u2019t\nrequired to monitor all content hosted\non, or moving through, their servers,\nbut are obliged to remove objectionable content once notified, and aid\ninvestigators if desired. According to\nthese laws, Google is very much in the\nclear. According to the Italian judicial\nsystem, however, Google is defined as\na \u2018content provider\u2019 and is therefore\nresponsible for monitoring all content\nbefore it is posted for public access,\nleading directly to the rather simplistic\nruling against Google. Yet that raises\nan obvious question; what content is\nGoogle actually providing? Google\nhas never marketed itself as a content\nprovider, at most a content host and\nlargely a content index; it doesn\u2019t assume ownership of any of the material\non its servers.\nThe precedent that such a ruling sets\nis truly worrying on consideration of\nits broader consequences. To begin\nwith, it implies that content hosts such\nas Google and Facebook would have\nto monitor every piece of information\nuploaded on to their servers, throwing\nup an entirely new set of privacy questions in the bargain. To do this would\nalso be financially prohibitive, meaning that the free services that we take\nfor granted would either need to start\ncharging, or shut down completely.\nEven then, with the Google employees\nbeing charged with violating the autistic boy\u2019s privacy rights, it would mean\nthat the hosts are responsible for tracking down the people in videos and ensuring that they are fine with the video\nbeing available for public viewing. This\nissue would be much worse for website\nhosting providers and cloud computing services, considering the wealth\nand diversity of the information hosted by them. It sounds ridiculous, and\nthat\u2019s because it is; no company should\nor would be able to maintain such a\nsystem.\nThankfully, the ruling isn\u2019t final and\nGoogle is appealing the verdict. How\nfar they will get in the Italian judicial\nsystem is another question, but it\u2019s going to be a while before the issue is finally settled. In the case that the ruling\nis upheld, however, the implications\nof the judgement are manifold. It will\nprobably cause Google and many other similar service providers to rethink\ntheir presence in Italy, and possibly\neven in the EU. Off the back of Google\u2019s\nspat with China, it\u2019s quite obvious that\nthe biggest issue when it comes to the\nspread of technology across the globe\nis the question of the moral policing of\nthe internet and who is responsible for\nit. With governments looking firmly\ntowards the hosts and the service pro-viders, it\u2019s not an issue that\u2019s going to\nbe resolved any time soon.\nFerozSalam\nFerozSalam Technology Reporter\nO\nK, listen carefully guys,\nwe\u2019re going to try and save\nyou some good money in\nfelix this week. For many of\nus, our mobile phones are a vital part\nof our lives. However, we often pay well\nover the odds for them. For instance,\ndid you know the cheapest iPhone 3GS\ncontact comes to \u00a3729 (not to mention\nextra call charges) over the 18 month\ncontract period? Did you know that\nper megabyte, sending a text message\nat 10p costs you almost eight times as\nmuch as it costs NASA to receive images of outer space from the Hubble\nSpace Telescope?\nMany of you will be able to save in\nthe region of \u00a3180 per year by switching to a SIM-only tariff. You must have\ncompleted the original length of your\ncontract on your phone, but then all\nit takes is a quick phone call to your\nnetwork.\nSIM-only tariffs\nTraditionally, mobile phone contracts have always bundled a \u201cfree\u201d\nphone together with a monthly allowance of minutes, texts and maybe Internet access. However, a bit of deeper\nanalysis shows that there really is no\nsuch thing as a free phone; typically\nyou\u2019ll pay a surcharge of about \u00a315\nper month on your bill for that \u201cfree\u201d\nit\u2019s just a case of looking around your\nnetwork\u2019s website, calling them up and\nasking to switch over. It\u2019s worth shopping around the other networks for\ngreat deals too.\nMost people find they can get the\nsame or better airtime allowance for\n\u00a315 less per month (giving a total of\nsaving of \u00a3180/year).\nApple iPhone 3G users\nIf you purchased an iPhone 3G\nclose to launch in around June 2008,\nyour 18-month contract will have just\ncome to an end over the last couple\nof months. O2 are offering a range of\nSIM-only iPhone tariffs with rolling\none-month and 12-month options.\nIf you are on the standard iPhone tar-iffs, you will currently be getting 600\nminutes, 500 texts and unlimited web\nbrowsing and WiFi for \u00a335 per month.\nHowever, by switching to \u2018Simplicity\n25 for iPhone\u2019 for example, you will\nget 600 minutes, unlimited texts and\nunlimited web browsing for \u00a325 per\nmonth; more texts and \u00a310 cheaper!\nFor the heaviest of phone users, there\nis also an \u2018Unlimited for iPhone\u2019 tariff\navailable with unlimited everything for\n\u00a350 per month. The best thing about\nthe both SIM-only iPhone tariffs is that\nyou can have a one-month rolling con-tract, allowing you to upgrade to the\nnew iPhone 4G in June without issue.\niPhone users can also shop around\nfor SIM-only tariffs on other networks\ntoo, but be aware that you\u2019ll need a\ndecent free Internet allowance and\nsome features such as Visual Voicemail\nmight stop working.\nHow to switch tariff or switch\nnetwork\nFinally, a couple of words on switching your phone tariff or network. If\nyou are staying on the same network\nbut want to switch tariff, you can call\nthe customer services of your mobile\nnetwork and ask to be switched over\nto your new tariff. Your phone number\nwon\u2019t change, you won\u2019t need a new\nSIM card; all that changes is your\nphone bill.\nIf you want to change network then\nthere are a few extra steps. Firstly,\nyou\u2019ll need to have an unlocked mobile\nphone. The best way of checking this\nis to insert a SIM card from a different network and seeing whether your\nphone will accept it. Secondly, you\u2019ll\nneed to ask your current network for\na PAC, a port authorisation code. This\nallows you to take your phone number\nto your new network. By law, they\u2019ll\nhave to provide you the code within\ntwo days of your request. Provide this\nPAC to your new network and your\nnumber should be transferred within\ntwo working days.\nHopefully this will be helpful! With\nmobile prices climbing, the cost of living already high and the odd beer here\nand there making a dent in your bank\naccount, every little bit saved helps.\nKen Lo takes a look at SIM-only tariffs, saving\nyou a decent chunk of change on your phone bill\n\u201c...per megabyte,\na text costs you 8\ntimes as much as\nit costs NASA to\nreceive images of\nouter space from\nHubble\u201d\nphone.\nSo if you\u2019ve just signed an 18-month\n\u00a335 per month phone contract: roughly \u00a315 per month of that goes on the\nsurcharge for the free phone, meaning\nthat \u201cfree\u201d phone really costs you \u00a3270.\nAfter the initial 18 months, you\u2019ve paid\noff that phone in full, so why should\nkeep paying the \u00a315 per month surcharge for the phone? In a straw poll,\nI\u2019ve found that the vast majority of\npeople keep paying the surcharge after\nthe initial length of their contract, in\nessence throwing \u00a315 per month down\nthe drain, or into the network\u2019s cof-fers, for no reason. Therefore, if you\u2019ve\ncompleted the original term of your\ncontract, you should consider switching to a SIM-only tariff.\nOn a SIM-only tariff, you only pay\nfor the airtime, or inclusive minutes;\nyou don\u2019t pay the phone surcharge because the tariff doesn\u2019t come with one.\nAll of the major mobile networks have\nSIM-only tariffs available, so usually\n\n"

The\nUnion wanted to ensure that Phase 3\nwas student-led from the very begin-ning. They made this very clear; from\ndiscussion groups to name suggesting,\nthey were keen to give this final stage\nof redevelopments in Beit Quad over\nto the people that will be using it.\nStudent apathy has long been a problem at Imperial. People either care too\nmuch or too little, and that\u2019s a major\nproblem. As a result, instead of celebrating the fact the students have both\nhands firmly on the Phase 3 steering\nwheel, there is a sense of a \u2018don\u2019t say we\ndidn\u2019t ask\u2019 attitude seeping from the\nUnion offices.\nIt was all going as well as the Union\ncould hope for, until last week\u2019s last\nminute decision to not use the winning\nname of the new bar. Despite putting\nthe name \u2018Library\u2019 on the shortlist,\nfears in the Union offices grew as\nquickly as its lead did in the polls. If\nthey didn\u2019t think it was suitable, they\nshouldn\u2019t have placed it on the shortlist\nof four from the start.\nThe name \u2018Consort\u2019 made a late surge\nthe night before voting closed and ended up as the most popular name, albeit\nby only three votes. However, come\nWednesday when the names were due\nto be announced in Friday\u2019s felix, indecision brought to light plenty of issues\nthat just need to be mentioned.\nThe final solution President Ashley\nBrown and Deputy President (Finance\n& Services) Daniel Hill ended up with\nwas to scrap the least popular name on\nthe poll, \u2018Crown & Shield\u2019, and re-open\nthe poll with another suggested name\nto replace it. No specific time-scale was\ngiven on when and how the new name\nwill make it to the poll, and indeed\nwhen the poll will actually become\nlive. There are mutterings it will be in\nthe Summer Term, and this is the term\nmost College students have exams or\nend-of-degree research projects to be\ncompleting. The students suggested\na total of 150 names for both bar and\nnightclub, and who says they\u2019re going\nto have any more time or inspiration\nin the Summer term to come up with\nanything that beats what was judged\nthe best and most suitable four names\noriginally shortlisted.\nThe Union claim to be listening to\nthe student body by holding off on a\nnew name for the bar. What they\u2019ve\nread is the 50-odd blog replies on\ntheir website where the online polls\nwere located. With around 900 votes\ncast across both polls and about 50\npeople complaining, that\u2019s around 6%\ndissatisfaction.\nThe people who don\u2019t mind the\nnames, or, dare I say it, like the names,\nhave voted and voiced their opinion.\nYet apparently the 131 people who\nwanted Consort as the new bar name\nhave been ignored, alongside the 127\npeople who wanted Quad, and the further 126 people who preferred Library.\nBelow is a sample of the complaints\nthat can be seen online. I\u2019ve been slow-clapping at my laptop for a good two\nhours now just reading some of the\ncomments.\n\u201cConsort (again, unimaginative, esp\nwith Prince Consort Road right around\nthe corner..I\u2019d like to know whether the\nperson who suggested such a name\nknew the meaning of it?)\u201d\nBuddy, I think the idea of \u2018Consort\u2019\nstemmed very clearly from the fact\nBeit Quad lies on Prince Consort\nRoad. Ain\u2019t those Manchester United\nlads so bloody unoriginal naming their\nstadium Old Trafford?! It\u2019s not like it\u2019s\nin a place called Trafford or nuffink!\nThe students picked the original 150\nnames, and the only discrepancy of the\nprocess has been how the shortlist was\nmade. The committee who took down\nthe 150 names to two short lists of five\nand four for the nightclub and bar respectively wasn\u2019t entirely student-led.\nIt had one student, three student-sab-baticals and three members of staff\npresent.\nThere should have been more ordinary students invited to the meet-ing, but of course any combination of\nnames picked from the original 150\nnames would have angered some-one. This process was never going to\nplease everybody and the Union have\nfolded under the slightest of pressures\nof about 50 people\u2019s displeasure at the\nboth the bar and nightclub names.\nThere are plenty of people calling the\nname \u2018Metric\u2019 \u201cembarrassing\u201d on the\nUnion website also, but this name apparently still remains \u2018usable\u2019.\nWhenever the Union do decide to\nre-open the poll with new suggestions\nfor the bar, they better tread carefully.\nAt the same time, however, they need\nto be bullish enough to make a final\ndecision. They have been guilty of doing neither this time around. Although,\ndon\u2019t you just see the same thing unfolding all over again, but this time\nwith even fewer people in favour and\nagainst the new shortlist?\nWhat a mess the Union finds itself in.\nThe Union has been run without any\nmajor hiccups so far this year, but after\nthis fiasco, it looks like it\u2019s starting to\nchoke.\nAlexKendall defendstheUnionrefurbishment\nI\nn last week\u2019s edition of felix,\nColin Hill outlined his opposition to the Beit redevelopment.\nHe believes the \u00a32.4m would\nbe better spent elsewhere and\nthat da Vinci\u2019s and dB\u2019s are fine as they\nare. In his defence, putting some of\nthis money back into Clubs and Societies seems like a good idea. After all\nthey are definitely facing budget cuts\nnext year and most Clubs have a good\nattendance.\nHowever, I think a good indicator of\nfuture renovations are those that have\nalready occurred. As anyone involved\nin Clubs and Societies will hopefully tell you, the new SAC has been\na God-send. It has more computers,\nmore space, a good layout and feels\nlike somewhere where Presidents and\nTreasurers of the various clubs and\nCSBs can sort out their paperwork. The\nstaff offices and SAC are now together.\nPreviously the offices were closed-plan\nand the SAC was in the basement. The\nrenewal makes clubs better, far more\nthan spreading the money the SAC redevelopment cost around the various\nclubs would have done.\nSo is spending any money on a new\nclub and bar really unnecessary? In\nwriting this I think you can guess that\nI do not think so. Colin (can I call you\nColin? I\u2019m going to assume so since\nyou haven\u2019t replied to my email) makes\nthe point that Cheapskates (a pretty\nrank club in central London) gets\nplenty of attendance even though the\ndecor is minimal because of the cheap\ndrinks. I agree that it is the people not\nthe place that makes a night out good,\nbut I don\u2019t think that is a good reason\nfor letting the Union\u2019s interior decoration rot even further.\nAnd then of course there is the example of the Reynolds, which up until\nits renovation was making losses of up\nto \u00a39000 per year. For the first time last\nyear it broke even. This is the perfect\nexample showing how renovation improves the desirability of a place to go\ndrinking.\nWe are, after all, trying to attract\nmore people than those who want to\nget completely drunk on cheap drinks.\nThere should be a place for everyone,\nfrom hardcore drinkers to those who\njust want to be social. That is why the\nUnion Bar is popular; it is a comfortable environment with an atmosphere\nof its own. The massive tables in da\nVinci\u2019s and the rather strange black\nand white paint do little to make it\nattractive for small social gatherings.\nAnd dB\u2019s with its bizarre floor colour-ings, tiny distant bar and fluorescent\nlighting when used as a da Vinci\u2019s overflow room gives possibly the worst\nwelcome I have ever seen. Regardless\nof who I sit in there with it does not\nfeel relaxing but more like a hospital\nreception. The seating is completely\nwrong for a club and there aren\u2019t even\nlights at the back.\nIf you have even the smallest vision\nof what the bar and club could be like,\nthink of it as not just remodelling with\na new paint job, but the attempt to\ncreate a new atmosphere where people want to drink or relax or dance.\nIt is a credit to the people who have\nput these plans together that it can\nbe paid for with no overt cut to Clubs\nand Societies funding. Phases 1 and 2\nhave worked extremely well and so will\nPhase 3.\nPeople do come first, but place\ncomes second. Paying for people is\nprobably illegal, and pretty sleazy; paying for place is something we can do.\n\u201cThere should be a\nplace for everyone,\nfrom hardcore\ndrinkers to those\nwho just want to\nbe social.\u201d\nWrite for Comment!

Soon after the RSM stepped their game up\nand kept possession of the ball.\nThe team camped on Camborne\u2019s 22 for a 10 minute spell but\nwere unable to penetrate their defence and found themselves going\nbackwards in the scrums.\nAt this stage the match remained\nscoreless. A break from one of the\nCamborne players set up an easy\npenalty which they kicked to provide the local miners a three point\nlead.\nShowing no intimidation, the\nRSM got straight back into the\ngame and came close to the oppositions try line, but unfortunately\nthe RSM had been struggling with\ntheir lineouts all day and a loose\nball off a lineout found its way into\nthe hands of a Camborne miner\nwho broke away.\nFreddie Chalke chased him\ndown for the tackle but the offload\nfound its way onto the Camborne\nwinger who scored.\nA failed conversion left the visitors trailing 8 \u2013 0. The second\nhalf was marked with very heavy\nrainfall which made the slow pitch\neven worse.\nUnfortunately the weather suited\nCamborne who from the go decided that rugby was a game better played with just 8 men and kept\nthe ball in the tight.\nThe RSM tried again and again\nto break the Camborne backline\nwith some deep runs from centres\nRob Dowden and Fraser James but\nthe conditions of the pitch made it\nhard to gather any pace.\nEventually tired from 75 minutes\nof exhausting rugby the RSM midfield missed a tackle and their 12\nbroke away.\nFullback Max Joachim and wing\nBlake closed him down but the\nCamborne player managed to kick\nthe ball ahead and in the resulting footrace one of the Camborne\nplayers got there first to ground\nthe ball for their second try.\nA disappointing game of rugby\nin more than unsuitable conditions\nfor a game of this magnitude.\nCongratulations have to go to\nCamborne who rarely do see the\nbottle and commiserations to all\nthe RSM rugby players for a hard\nfought match and giving it everything they had.\nA special mention goes\nto Ali Philpott who is\nthe living proof that\nperseverance does\nget you places.\nNormality will be\nrestored next year,\nhowever.\nBorja Sordo De Le\nPenha\nMen\u2019s - RSM 1 - 5 CSM\nE\nveryone in the squad was wide\nawake and more than fired up,\nready to avenge the loss of our tro-phy, the Sharpley cup, to CSM last\nyear.\nThe match started well, with an unusually\nfit RSM squad continually harassing the Cambourne team, our defences strong marking\nand forcing them to make mistakes and lose\npossession. Likewise, we started strongly in\nmidfield, with several attacking breaks. Ten\nminutes in this was rewarded when Nick\nJones on the right wing found himself with the\nball in space and was able to slot the ball in\nbehind the net.\nCSM, however, countered strongly, and the\ngame remained fairly even for the rest of the\nhalf. The RSM suffered a major setback when\na short-corner goal was disallowed and an immediate CSM counter-attack blew through\nthe team before we were fully ready. The newly determined CSM team pressed their advantage home and despite some valiant efforts\nthe RSM were unable to stem the tide in the\nsecond half. The end score of 5-1, however,\ndoes not reflect the spirit shown by those on\nthe pitch, who played with the highest intensity right to the final whistle. Both our most\nexperienced players, and those who had never\nplayed hockey before this year put in brilliant\ngames and, although we came away disappointed with the score, the RSM team should\nstill be proud of their performance.\nWomen\u2019s - RSM 0 - 3 CSM\nE\nvery member of the team was feeling slightly nauseous as we arrived\nat the pitch; we had never got such\na good team together and were feeling positive yet terrified - Sammy\nthrowing up on the journey to the pitch due to\nsome odd illness that makes you cry. Thankfully due to the kindness of the opposition\u2019s\ncaptain we moved push back to 9.15.\nDuring the match brilliant saves were made\nby Sammy and her fellow defenders, with pure\ndedication from the midfielders and forwards.\nUnfortunately, despite holding extremely\nwell and being the better side in the first half,\nour fitness and the unfortunate choice of referees by CSM meant we conceded 3 goals in\nthe second half. But regardless of the score the\ngame was thrilling to watch I\u2019m sure and an\nhonour to play in. No bitterness is held over\nthe loss as we know we all played the best we\nhave ever done. It is just a feeling of disappointment we are left with toward the Camborne players, who continued to be dishonest\ntowards the spirit of the Bottle Match and insist on playing Falmouth and Exeter players.\nMark Porter & Kirsty Poore\n\n"

And most depressingly,\nthink of all the little-known bands who\nwont get to do live sessions because\nthey aren\u2019t popular enough for Radio 1.\nThe money the BBC will save is going to go towards funding more TV\nprograms, but who watches TV anyway when there\u2019s iplayer?\nInstead of cutting an interesting, ex-perimental, really, really, good radio\nstation with shows presented by musical pioneers for people who really like\nmusic, why not get rid of* that hideous\nmisogynistic fungus on the toe of hu-manity, Chris Moyles? Yes, he is popu-lar, but so are Coca-Cola and Kinder\nBuenos, the truth is that people would\nbe healthier without them. Whoever\nthe big cheese of BBC radio is could really do something good for the nation\u2019s\npeople by getting rid of Chris Moyles.\nWe may not be able to end world pov-erty, conflicts in war zones, or the mass\ndestruction of our natural environ-ment, but someone somewhere can get\nrid of Chris Moyles. I can only imagine the reason he hasn\u2019t is some sort of\nsadistic weirdo like that guy from the\nfilm Seven.\nWhile we\u2019re there, get rid of Fearne\n\u201cI\u2019m punk like Avril Lavigne\u201d Cotton,\nand Vernon \u201csort of guy you\u2019d find at\nWalkabout\u201d Kay.

If that doesn\u2019t\nsound like your thing, you won\u2019t like\nthis band. I like the hand clapping and\nharmonizing vocals. The more I listen to this the better it gets.\n-Alex Ashford\nM\naybe burlesque rock,\nmaybe gypsy garage,\nbut definitely fuzza-billy. Eighteen Nightmares at the Lux kick\nout a sound that would be surf rock\ncome poltergeist, that has some unfinished business with rocking out, clear-ly, and they\u2019ve only just released their\nEP, \u2018Fuzz Candy\u2019.\nBeing based in London, the foursome have a sound of what their name\nbest describes, a fuzzing nightmare,\nwith surfer rhythms and tight progres-sions. Having been played since 2007,\nthese boys have just had their album\nlaunch at The Notting Hill Arts Club,\nand are undoubtably at the tip of the\niceberg when it comes to spreading\ntheir sounds far and wide.\nThis music is difficult to capture in\nwords but suits the image of a surfing\nskeleton. It\u2019s classic rock with fuzz, 60\u2019s\ngarage without a leash, a blend of the\ndark side to all things good, with that\nburlesque charm, a surfing nightmare\nand for that reason we love it.\nThe young London based quartet\nrides out this music, with frontman\nShimmie keeping his calm and any\neyes transfixed as the vocals yell and\nwarn of sounds to come in burlesque\nmanner. As the fuzzabilly takes over\nand raw bass thunders from Const\u2019s\nMost listened to this week by\nFelix Music members on last.fm\n1. Radiohead\n2. Muse\n3. Florence + The Machine\n4. RHCP\n5. Bloc Party\n6. The Killers\n7. The Beatles\n8. David Bowie\n9. Coldplay\n10. Foo Fighters\nWhy do we still have this again? - Alex Ashford\ndriving, crunching basslines forceful\nin every way giving the sound its fuzz.\nThe rhythm brings the drive back a\nstep to the surfer beats of 60s garage\nfrom Allen, giving a defining sound\nto Eighteen Nightmares at the Lux.\nKeeping the surf-rock alive through\nthe dynamic drumming, the guitar-ing bridges the perfect gap between\nthe powerful fuzz and the rockabilly-ness of the drumming. With vibrato\nsounds and rumbling rhythms coming\nfrom Greg\u2019s guitar, sometimes echoed in both parts, the spring reverb\nand tremolo picking accompanied by\nscreeching solos with jangling riffs,\nkeeps the sound fresh. This arrangement gets a dosing of deathly organ-sounding keyboard for the eerieness,\nparticularly in \u2018Ketchup Stains\u2019, where\ndeathly laughs ring out before careering into the chorus.\nEighteen Nightmares at the Lux released their chilling EP, \u2018Fuzz Candy\u2019\nin February. Featuring said \u2018Ketchup\nStains\u2019, it also has the wild dog that is\n\u2018Your Disaster\u2019 and vibrato guitaring\nfrom \u2018Chick, Chase, Kick\u2019. The EP feels\nas though it is just dipping your toe\ninto Eighteen Nightmares, as though\nit doesn\u2019t give you enough, that\u2019s the\nidea of an EP I guess, leave you wanting more, which it does well.\nHaving blasted apart the Notting\nHill Arts Club with new and old mu-sic, with help from the energy crazed\ncrowd, Eighteen Nightmares at the\nLux is not playground music, it\u2019s a\nsurge of power, of fuzz and damn-right frightening. - Luke Turner\n\n"

We were\nfeeling confident after some great\nperformances the previous weekend,\nwhere we beat high quality opposition\nin a warm-up tournament.\nThe first game of the day was against\nChichester, a game we expected to win.\nAfter a bit of a slow start, we eventually\ngot our heads in the game and capitalised on their mistakes, going on to win\n11-3.\nOur second game was against the\nteam who broke our hearts during\nthe indoor season, the Surrey Scorpions. They put on a very effective zone\ndefence which forced us into making\nsilly mistakes and shut down our of-fence. After bringing the score back\nto 5-5 after a mammoth point, Surrey\nscored twice in quick succession to win\n7-5. This put us in a difficult position,\nneeding to win our next five matches\nto secure a maximum of 3rd place and\na place in Division 1 Nationals.\nAfter our disappointment of losing\nto Surrey, we came out hard and completely shut down one of the stronger\nsecond teams, Sussex 2, beating them\n13-2. There was still plenty of scope for\nimprovement, but we were confident\ngoing into Sunday that we would be\nable to rediscover our form from the\nprevious weeks.\nSunday started well, with dD1 winning against Kent 13-4. Straight off that\nwin, we beat UCL 11-8 in what was a\nmuch tighter game. They managed to\nget some speculative long throws out\nto their star player which put us under\npressure, but we managed to neutral-ise that threat and pulled away with the\nwin.\nThat win set up a rematch against\nSurrey. This time dD1 were on form;\nour offence was clinical and our defence pressurised them into making\nmistakes, enabling us to win 15-5, and\nsetting up a decider against Sussex 1\nfor Division 1 qualification.\nIt was a very close game and Sussex\nmanaged to pull away to 8-5 up after\nsome great long throws. Nevertheless,\ndD1 kept their heads to bring the score\nback to 9-9, setting up a sudden death\npoint, which Sussex scored despite the\nbest efforts of the seven dD players on\nthe pitch.\nDespite being bitterly disappointed\nto not achieving the fairytale finish of\nqualifying for Division 1 Nationals, we\nplayed our best Ultimate in our last\ngame, so we take heart from that. dD2\nwere hoping to put in a good performance against some more experienced\nopposition, and won their first game\nagainst Surrey 2 before being unlucky\nnot to beat some of the first teams on\noffer.\nAll in all, it was a successful weekend\nfor Imperial College Ultimate with everyone putting in good performances.\nIC discDoctors narrowly miss out on first division spot\n\n"

The film is\nclaustrophobically directed by Kathryn Bigelow, both James\nCameron\u2019s ex-wife and his main rival for the Best Director\naward. Bigelow manages to maintain nail-biting tension,\nwhile giving a captivating look at the individuals within\nthe team. The film is shot in an up-close and personal\nstyle, which adds to the cagey atmosphere that is sustained\nthroughout. The style contrasts massively to large-scale\nand expansive Avatar. It seems fitting that The Hurt Locker\nshould be taking on Avatar for this year\u2019s big Oscar prizes.\nReviewed by Stefan Zeeman\nNominated for: Best Picture, Direction (Kathryn\nBigelow), Original Screenplay (Mark Boal), Actor in a\nLeading Role (Jeremy Renner), Cinematography, Editing,\nMusic Score, Sound Mixing, Sound EditingInglourious Basterds\nSteven Spielberg somehow managed to make a film about\nMossad boring. On the other hand Quentin Tarantino\u2019s film\nabout a crack squad of Jewish soldiers drawn into a plot to\nmurder Hitler is a brilliant revenge fantasy. The star of the\nshow is Christoph Waltz whose incredible performance as\nthe \u2018Jew Hunter\u2019 Hans Landa elevates the film to very high\nstandard.

Determined to\nshow the naive girl the error of her logic, Ryan takes her on\none of his cross country firing expeditions, but as she starts\nto realize the disheartening realities of her profession, he\nbegins to see the downfalls to his way of life.\nReview taken from www.imdb.com\nNominated for: Best Picture, Direction (Quentin\nTarrantino), Actor in a Supporting Role (Christolph\nWaltz, Original Screenplay (Quentin Tarrantino)\nWhat the Bookies say\nBest Picture:\nThe Hurt Locker 2 - 1\nAvatar 10 - 4\nInglourious Basterds 15 - 1\nBest Director:\nKathyrn Bigelow 6 - 5\nJames Cameron 4 - 1\nQuentin Tarantino 29 - 1\nBest Actor:\nJeff Bridges 6 - 5\nGeorge Clooney 13 - 1\nColin Firth 19 - 1\nBest Actress:\nSandra Bullock 5 - 3\nMeryl Streep 3 - 1\nCarey Mulligan 12 - 1\nBest Supporting Actor:\nChristoph Waltz 1.03 - 1.\nWoody Harrelson 15 - 1\nChristopher Plummer 29 - 1\nBest Supporting Actress\nMo\u2019Nique 1.05 - 1\nAnna Kendrick 17 - 1\nMaggie Gyllenhaal 21 - 1\nBest Animated Film\nUp 1.05 - 1\nFantastic Mr. Fox 12 - 1\nCoraline 26 - 1\nSacha Baron Cohen was originally considered to host the ceremony but was apparently\ntoo much of a \u2018wild-card\u2019 and so was quite wisely dropped.

But the girls were eager to get\ngoing, and after a few rushed toilet\nbreaks in the petrol station across the\nroad, we changed in the bus and began\nour warm-up.\nWe quickly discovered that we were\na bit of a novelty at the tournament\n\u2013 having only two Irish players \u2013 and\nthe Brighton captain even went on to\nsay that it was \u201cso NICE\u201d that we had\ntaught the other girls how to play.\nWhen our first match finally kicked\noff two hours late and on a pitch small\nenough to rival a 5-aside football pitch,\nthe girls were ready for it. Brighton was\na tough team, all experienced players,\nbut our girls didn\u2019t give them an inch.\nThe opening few minutes saw Carla\nthe Angry Argentinean slot a ball easily between the posts \u2013 a great opener\nfor the tournament. Brighton weren\u2019t\nhappy. As their condescending captain\nscreamed bloody murder at them all\nthrough the game they fought hard,\nbut just not hard enough. Every 50-50 ball was well contested and every\ntackle was hard. With brilliant play all\nover the pitch from IC, Brighton was\ncracking.\nThe 2nd half was much the same.\nBrighton\u2019s captain, in fairness to her,\ngot a couple of nice points but these\nwere well overshadowed by a well-placed goal from Cath Parkinson. With\n2minutes to go the score was 1-01 (4)\nto 0-02 to IC. Unfortunately as the\npressure mounted a few silly mistakes\non our part resulted in 2 easy free-kicks that went straight over the bar,\nleaving the game at 4 points apiece.\nBrighton was lucky to get away with a\ndraw \u2013 and they knew it.\nThe next game didn\u2019t go so well. The\ngirls fought hard but unfortunately\nour inexperience on the pitch started\nto show. With some lovely team play\nand passing and some great runs down\nthe line from the girls, Imperial left no\ndoubt to the amount of work they\u2019d put\nin over the previous 5 months. A beautifully taken long-range point under\npressure saw Hilda Dooley put IC on\nthe scoreboard, but this was no match\nfor Stirling\u2019s tally.\nA special mention to Jade Yap who\nplayed her first match of the year, and\ndespite being the tiniest player on the\npitch and marking someone at least\ntwice her size, managed to get away\nsome good passes.\nThe rest of the matches followed\nwith more of the same. With Mia\n\u2018Gobby\u2019 Gorman making some spectacular saves and clearances, the girls\nbattled to keep the scoreline down, and\neven managed to put a few scores on\nthe board with two points from Carla\nagainst defending champions Solford,\nand Chloe McKeon capitalizing on a\nwell placed pass against Chester.\nSo, after (briefly) lamenting our loss,\nwe headed back to our hotel and got\nready to go out for a night in the North.\nFrom a couple of casual drinks in\nSpoons with 50 year old women in hair\nextensions and ridiculous mini-dresses\nto getting in on the Tiger-Tiger guest\nlist for wearing our GAC training jack-ets, it was definitely a night to remember and despite the early start and trek\nback home, it was a great weekend.\nWell done to all the girls that played\n\u2013 you did yourselves proud!\nFancy trying Gaelic out?\nWe are still training!\nContact Katie: kc208@ic.ac.uk\nLast Wednesday the IC fencing club\nhad another day of matches to try and\nprolong what has already been a very\ngood season for the club. Three encounters were scheduled in Ethos : the\nMen\u2019s 1sts vs Durham University, the\nWomen\u2019s 1sts vs Birmingham University and the Men\u2019s 2nds vs Hertfordshire University.\nBoth 1st teams were vying for a\nsemi-final spot in the BUCS Championships, synonymous with a ticket to\nSheffield alongside the best of British university sport. Spread over four\ndays, with 6000 athletes competing in\ntwenty-six sports, the Championships\nare a very alluring target for any team,\nand the fencing club\u2019s main objective this season. Victory was therefore\nimperative.\nThe seconds were fencing the semifinal of the south-eastern conference\ncup, a win meaning a place in the final\nand a chance of more silverware (not\nto mention extending their 8-match\nunbeaten run).\nDurham turned up on time, despite\nthe long journey they had to make, and\npretty soon the teams were underway,\nbeginning with foil. The Imperial captain was still suffering from a bout of\nstomach flu, and was replaced by Chris\nGilliam. The foilists posted an easy\nwin, displaying some very solid fencing\nand giving the sabreurs a lead which\nthey extended to the point that the fi-anl weapon, epee, only needed to score\ntwo hits (in a match to 45!) to wrap up\nproceedings.\nThe girls made similarly short work\nof Birmingham, with Hannah Bryars\ndisplaying impressive sabre skills despite being a resolute foilist. The final\nscore was a very large 135-58 win to\nImperial.\nThe 2nds had a much tighter match\nagainst Hertfordshire, showing great\ndetermination and grit to win by a\nmeager seven hits, 115-108. This puts\nthem into the final of the cup against\nSurrey.\nWednesday\u2019s successes mean that\nboth the Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s 1st teams\nwill be part of the Imperial contingent\ntravelling up to Sheffield next week to\ntry a nd grab the highest honours University sport has to offer. Both teams\nare in with a very good chance of win-ning...How far can the fencing club go?\n\n"

And you\nwould not be wrong. It\u2019s not that I am\nyet to master the art of the English lan-guage. Oh no. I even got an A at GCSE\nso that puts me well above the majority\nof the scummy inbreds of greater London. It\u2019s mainly a fact of life- the fact\nthat I have no time and want to be in\none of two places. Firstly the lab. I like\nmy lab, I can hit a bit of metal in the\nlab, often for no real reason. Secondly,\nand by far my more preferred abode, I\nwant to be in the bar. The Union Bar\nis always by some distance my first\nchoice.\nSo, ensuring that this section, which\nnobody is really interested in anyway,\nhas no errors is very low on my list of\npriorities. In fact I think it\u2019s just fallen\noff of the bottom. Let me check... yes\nit has.

And not the big\nchunks either. In the headline: \u2018Earth\nday negligibly shorter\u2019 there is one\nword of the four that I would tend to\nfocus on. That\u2019ll be the word \u2018negligibly\u2019. In it\u2019s very nature it points towards\ninconsequentiality and therefore me\nnot giving a shit.\nPresumably some people were more\ninterested than I, and presumably\nthese people are not just mental, but a\nbit lonely. If you are one of these deluded individuals then I wish you the best\nof luck with all the moral and social\nstruggles that life seems to be placing\nupon you. Help can be found for you,\nbut just don\u2019t ask me.\nHaving said all that, I have just ranted for two columns about it...\nSophie Lambrakis 12 Points\nNew\nFuller\nIndividual\nList\nYES!!!\nWordpath 1,456\nHow to play:\nMake a path from the origin word to the destination\nword by taking steps between words using one of the\nthree following methods:\nLetter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.\ne.g. WORD -> WARD\nAnagram: Rearrange the letters.\ne.g. WARD -> DRAW\nWordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter\nword from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.\ne.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)\nNo consecutive steps may be made by the same method.\ne.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would\nbe invalid.\nPoints are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path\nbetween the two words.

Up achieves this feat perhaps more completely than any other Pixar film. The growing relationship between the two leads keeps older viewers\nhooked and that leaves you with a warm feeling after the\ncredits.\nAs Russell\u2019s enthusiasm for exploration reminds Carl of\nhis childhood ambitions, director Pete Docter makes us recall the fantasies that were our own comforts when we were\nyoung. Rarely do films marketed towards children have this\nkind of emotional depth, and I haven\u2019t even mentioned the\nsubtle allusions to Russell\u2019s relationship with his father.\nReviewed by Eliot Barford (abridged)\nNominated for: Best Picture, Original Screenplay,\nAnimated Feature, Music Score, Sound Editing\nPrecious\nClareece Precious Jones is an overweight, illiterate sixteen-year old girl living in poverty in Harlem, pregnant for the\nsecond time by her father. She lives with her abusive mother\nand has just been suspended from school. But this is not a\nfilm that tries to shove a gratuitously gritty abuse story in\nyour face, it never dares you to confront the harsh realism\nof it all in that frustratingly arrogant way that some films do.\nNewcomer Gabourey Sidibe in the starring role gives a powerful and impressively balanced performance, never overdoing it. It is a tremendous presentation of a difficult story that\nshowcases some truly impressive talent.\nReviewed by Jade Hoffman (abridged)\nNominated for: Best Picture, Direction (Lee Daniels),\nAdapted Screenplay (Geoffery Fletcher), Actress in a\nLeading Role (Gabourey Sidibe), , Editing, Actress in a\nsupporting role (Mo\u2019Nique)\nDistrict 9\nThe Surprise hit of the summer and rightly so. District 9\ngives a much needed shot of adrenaline into the frail sci-fi\ngenre. The story of mistreatment of alien refugees with its\nreal life allusions to Zimbabweans in South Africa is perfectly accompanied by awe-inspiring special effects and\nedge-of-your-seat action. The film\u2019s protagonist Vickus is\none of the most subtle anti-heroes ever written, immoral\nand selfish yet you still find yourself cheering him on as va-pourises his ex-colleagues. Unfortunately Sci-fi has never\npeformed well at the Oscars, 2001: A Space Odyssey was\nonly nominated for a technical award.\nReviewed by Ed Knock\nNominated for: Best Picture,, Adapted Screenplay (Neill\nBlomkamp), Film Editing, Visual Effects\nThe Blind Side\nIn this simplified, somewhat shallow rags-to-riches biopic\nbased on the NFL football player Michael Oher\u2019s life, a\nstrong-willed, well-off, upper-class woman) adopts a homeless black teen, helping him rebuild his troubled life. With\nslow but steady academic progress, she also sees his potential in becoming a sports champion.\nThere are warm, fuzzy moments thanks to the strong,\nlikeable performances from the cast, Bullock shows plenty\nof strength and sentiment. A sweet, moving tale, but its\nplacement in the list of nominees is questionable especially\nwhen so many more deserving films were left out.\nReviewed by John Park\nNominated for: Best Picture, Actress in a leading role\n(Sandra Bullock)\nAn Education\nThe film tells one of those coming-of-age tales about living life to the full, lying to the parents and, invariably, about making mistakes. But An Education.\nhas a slightly more refined taste than the usual oversweetened popcorn we are\nserved. There\u2019s no denying that An Education is an extremely well made movie.\nReviewed by Zuzanna Blaszczak (abridged)\nNominated for: Best Picture, Actress in a Leading Role (Carey Mulligan),\nAdapted Screenplay (Nick Hornby)\nA Serious Man\nA Serious Man tells the story of Larry Gopnik, a Jewish physics professor who\nconstantly tries to do the right thing and be a good man despite the fact that\nhis life seems to be falling apart around him. The Coen\u2019s sharp script, and their\nlack of concession in portraying a relentlessly honest life, means this film has a\nresonance that will leave you thinking for longer than most films will.\nReviewed by Tim Davies (abridged)\nNominated for: Best Picture, Original Screenplay (Coen Brothers)\nBest Drama - Avatar\nBest Comedy - The Hangover\nBest Actor - Jeff Bridges\nBest Actress - Sandra Bullock\nBest Supporting ActorChristoph Waltz\nBest Supporting Actress - Meryl\nStreep\nBest Director - James Cameron\nBest Screenplay - Up in the Air\nBest Musical Score - Michael\nGlacchino (Up)\nBest Foreign Language FilmThe White Ribbon (Germany)\nGolden Globes Winners\nBest Film - The Hurt Locker\nBest Actor - Colin Firth\nBest Actress - Carey Mulligan\nBest Supporting ActorChristoph Waltz\nBest Supporting ActressMo\u2019Nique\nBest Director - Kathryn Bigelow\nBest Original Screenplay - Mark\nBoal (The Hurt Locker)\nBest Adapted Screenplay - Jason\nReitman (Up in the Air)\nBest Foreign Language Film - A\nProphet (France)\nBest British Film - Fish Tank\nBAFTA Winners\n\n"

Surfing along\nhappily not giving away any personal data, it\u2019s hard to imagine how you\ncould be recognisable amongst the vast\nsea of people browsing online. In fact,\nyour computer gives away a wealth of\ninformation about you to every single\nwebsite you visit. For web developers,\nthis data can be invaluable in making\ninteresting, dynamic websites, but it\ncan also be used to build up a picture of\nwho you are and where you come from.\nThe first major source of this information is your browser. The actual\ndata available varies from browser to\nbrowser, but most of them transmit\nyour operating system, the resolution of your screen and what fonts\nand plug-ins you have installed. This\nmight not seem like much, but in fact\nit\u2019s enough to differentiate a single\nperson from more than half a million\nothers. Panopticlick (http://panopti-click.eff.org/), an experiment started\nby the Electronic Frontier Foundation,\naims to see just how much information\nyou give away as you surf. Information\nabout your browser is collected and\ncompared to others they\u2019ve already\nseen, and how traceable you are online\nis calculated. To the shock of many, it is\noften the case that a user is completely\nunique amongst the 640,000 or so en-tries, being identifiable from browser\ninformation alone.\nAll this would not be so bad, were it\nnot for the fact that websites can also\ntell where you live. An IP address is a\nunique number assigned to you when\nyou connect to the Internet through\nyour ISP. Web servers use your IP address to route \u2018packets\u2019 or data from a\nwebsite to you, but websites can also\ndetect and use your IP address to find\nout information about you. Using a\nlook-up service, your IP address can\ntell a website your approximate loca-tion, accurate to the town or village\nyou live in. In special cases like univer-sities, this can be even more accurate.\nFor instance, anyone using a college\nconnection broadcasts that they are\nconnected at Imperial College London. Location information can also be\ngained using a relatively new technology called the \u2018Geolocation API\u2019. Websites can request location data from\nthe browser, which provides the exact\nposition of the user right down to the\nactual street address they currently\ninhabit. Although this information is\nonly meant to be sent if the user gives\ntheir consent, with more and more lo-cation-aware browsing, one day it may\nbe sent automatically.\nEven though a lot of information is\nprovided to websites, up until now it\nhas been impossible to actually differentiate between individual users of one\ncomputer who browse a site. After all,\nthe computer looks and runs the same\nno matter who is using it. The solution\nto this came from a company called\nScout Analytics, who have used \u2018typing\ncadence\u2019 to tell the difference between\nindividuals online. When you type,\nyou have a characteristic rhythm and\npace, characterised by the time taken\nto move between keys and how long\nyou hold a key down for. Scout Analytics have developed a method to collect\nthese timings and have reported the\nability to detect individual users just\nby the way they type in their username\nand password. The algorithm has already been successfully used in a trial\nto stop multiple users accessing expensive online services for which only a\nsingle license has been purchased.\nFor those of us who are now considering hanging up their keyboards for\ngood, there are a few things that can\nincrease your level of anonymity on-line. The Panopticlick experiment has\nshown that fonts and plug-ins are one\nof the biggest differentiators between\nbrowsers, so not installing custom\nfonts or plug-ins will help you be less\nunique. Another more drastic option is\nto disable JavaScript in your browser,\nwhich is how websites get most of their\ninformation about you. Although it is\nan easy way to reveal less about your-self, most modern websites use JavaScript in abundance and so you may find\nmany things stop working properly\nwhen you make the change. Your final\nchance is to browse through a proxy,\nan online server that routes your entire\nInternet traffic through itself to hide\nyour actual IP address from websites,\nor make use of a privacy network called\nTOR, of which more information on\nwhich can be found at www.proxy.org\nor www.torproject.org respectively.\nT\nhis week we\u2019ve got a veritable feast of articles for\nyou. From money-saving\ntips from Ken Lo, to legal\nabsurdity from Italy by\nFeroz Salam and why you\u2019re not anonymous whilst surfing by Simon Worthington. Of course, we\u2019ve also got the\nWeekly Wrap-up with some gorgeous\ncars, a Lord and an Apple.\nBut this week saw something I fundamentally disagree with: cutbacks\nat the BBC in preparation for a Tory\ngovernment.\nOK, cutbacks because of budget deficits are one thing, unavoidable in times\nof poor profits and economic instabil-ity. But that\u2019s just the thing, we\u2019re talking about the BBC. It isn\u2019t a company\nhellbent on making profits, or one\nthat needs a steady consumer income\nto support itself. It has the TV licence\nfee to avoid that very problem, to provide content that would otherwise be\nunfeasible if it had to make a profit. So\nwhy is it that the BBC is making cuts to\nits online presence and two of its digital radio stations, 6 Music and Asian\nNetwork?\nIt all revolves around the highly likely\noutcome of the General Election going\nin a Conservative direction. It\u2019s not a\nsecret that the Conservatives would\nlike to restructure and change the way\nthe BBC operates. Given their posi-tion, the BBC is making pre-emptive\nchanges before it\u2019s pushed. 25% of the\nfunding to the BBC website, one of the\nmost visited sites in Britain and arguably one of the best sources of good\nquality online journalism, is being cut\nmeaning that whole sections are going\nto be lost. BBC 6 Music and Asian Network are also to be cut, with the BBC\ndiverting the extra \u00a3600 million into its\nexisting programming.\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nMarch already? Blimey, this\nyear\u2019s going quick. Speaking of\nquick, this week had not one,\nnot two, but three eco-sports\ncars featuring in the news. First\nup, we had Tesla announcing a\npartnership to make a special\nedition TAG Heuer Roadster,\nmaking yet another entry into\nthe \u2018cars you wish you had the\nmoney for\u2019\nlist.\nPorsche made its first entry\ninto the hybrid performance\ncar space this week with its 918\nSpyder hybrid concept. It\u2019s not\noften you associate the terms\n\u2018mpg\u2019 and \u2018gorgeous\u2019, but, as\nyou can see for yourself, this\n3.4L V8 combined electric\n500bhp, 78mpg beauty has\nit all. If you want to see more\nof what could be Porsche\u2019s\ngreatest piece of design, the\n0-62 in 3.2 second beast can\nbe glimpsed at the Geneva\nMotor Show this year.\nThe\nthird eco-sports car to hit the\nnews this week was from the\nonce-British Lotus. The 414E\nHybrid concept bolts a 1.2L\nthree-cylinder engine with\ntwo independent electric motors for the rear wheels giving\nthe plug-in mean-machine a\n300-mile combined range. The\ncombustion engine can run on\nalcohol-based fuels or regular\npetrol, whilst an external audio\nsystem makes sure everyone\ncan hear you coming and not\nsilently creeping up on them\nwith battery alone.\nLast but not the least on the\n\u2018hybrid\u2019 front, this week we had\nan entry from Sanyo. Differing\nfrom the Porsche and Lotus by\none important factor, that being the \u2018traditional\u2019 engine part\nof the equation is you; the SL\nEneloop hybrid bike charges as\nyou pedal along the flat, freewheeling downhill and when\nyou brake to power an electric motor to haul your ass up\nthat massive hill. Yours for the\ncommute for $1800. Think I\u2019ll\nstick to the Tube, thanks.\nWe\u2019re meant to be in \u2018election fever\u2019 right now according to the media. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m\nfeeling it, but if you just can\u2019t\nget enough of the Conservative Party, as the saying goes,\nthere\u2019s an App\nfor that. Yes\nthat\u2019s right,\nDavid has his\nown iPhone\nApp. Follow\nthe Conservative polices, up-to-the-minute\nnews and canvas your mates\ninto voting Tory with the \u2018Call\na Friend\u2019 feature. Nice.\nIn other smartphone news,\nBlackberry users can finally get\nthe sweet, sweet nectar that is\nthe BBC iPlayer on their pocket pal of choice. Bold 2 and\nStorm 2 wielders can download the app and stream over\nWiFi on any network or 3G on\nVodafone and 3.\nSir Clive Sinclair, the in-venter of the \u2018pocket\u2019 calcula-tor, the Sinclair ZX80 which\nessentially created home computing and the C5, an electric\ncar thing that, well, didn\u2019t take\noff, dropped a bomb this week\nadmitting that he doesn\u2019t use a\ncomputer. Yes that\u2019s right, he\nhas his emails read to him. OK\nSir Clive, if that\u2019s the way you\nwant to go.\nIt couldn\u2019t be a week in the\ntech industry without some\nstory to come out of Apple.\nIf it\u2019s not about child labour,\nit\u2019s about Apple\u2019s in-house\ndesigned ARM chip, the A4.\nApparently, contrary to what\nwas first thought, the blazing\nA4 isn\u2019t a dual-core Cortex A9\nchip, but a current generation\nsingle-core A8 chip similar to\nthe iPhone 3GS\u2019s, with several\ncomponents removed to save\npower. Seems like less really\nis more in this\ncase.\nSamuel\nSamuel\nGibbs\nGibbs\nTechnology\nEditor\nBBC Radio\nBye-Bye\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nThe BBC has put forward two separate arguments for these cuts. The\nfirst being that they need to focus on\nquality rather than trying to cover eve-rything. Now, I agree, quality is para-mount. But if the BBC aren\u2019t going to\ntry and cover a good variety of things,\nespecially the less popular but equally-deserving sections of the news, then\nwho is? The point of a public broadcaster is that it can cover things that\naren\u2019t economically-viable.\nThe BBC website is a prime example\nof a non-commercially viable resource\nthat provide a fantastic public serv-ice. This argument also rolls into the\ncuts made to digital radio. Whilst 6\nMusic and Asian Network don\u2019t have\nenormous followings (about 600k and\n350k respectively), they are listened to\nand are valued. If it were a commercial radio station those listener numbers would be a failure of course, but\nthat\u2019s the point, it\u2019s not. Stations like\n6 Music and Asian Network provide\na service to society and are one of the\nonly advantages DAB radio has to attract consumers into jumping on the\ndigital radio band wagon. Why should\nthe public suffer just because commercial alternatives aren\u2019t doing well in\nthe economic downturn? Surely now\nis not the time for cuts but the time to\nbolster those public broadcast services\nthat the commercial sector just can\u2019t\nprovide?\nOf course the cuts hit the news this\nweek, from the mainstream media to\nthe technology press, causing an public outcry of support for 6 Music. Although 6 Music and Asian Network\nare set to close by the end of 2011, the\nBBC has admitted that they might rethink the closures given enough sup-port. Time for more Facebook/Twitter\ngrassroot campaigns, perhaps?\ny y\nmoney for\u2019\nr\nlist.\nbe\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb glimpsed at the Geneva\nMo\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM tor Show this year.\nThe\ny\nin this\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nEDITOR\nThe Felix Editor is responsible for producing a weekly issue of the student newspaper. There are 30 per year ranging from 32 to more than 40\npages per issue. The Felix Editor is in charge of the overall direction of the\nnewspaper and for informing the student body on the issues that matter\nto them, as well as providing plenty of crosswords and puzzles for completion in lectures, of course! Each week you will have to source and write\nnews articles and features as well as supervise the other editors to ensure\ntheir sections are properly laid-out and edited. You will be responsible for\nthe newspaper\u2019s finances as well as leading your band of writers. There will\nbe sleepless nights, but it\u2019s a chance to flex your creative muscles and reign\nover a publication read by thousands every week.\nI\nlove felix. I\u2019ve worked under three separate\neditors, and my involvement has been the\nmost important part of my student life. The\nopportunities and experiences I\u2019ve received\nshould be open to everyone and I plan on making\nevery effort to encourage all students to write, edit\nand get involved.\nI will:\nmake it easier to get involved by:\n- Holding open meetings so that you can meet the\nsection Editors in person. By face-to-face interaction you\u2019ll hopefully feel more comfortable about\ncontributing to the paper.\n- Setting a stall in the JCR to further break down\nthe wall between students and felix. You\u2019ll be able\nto speak to me directly to find out how you can get\ninvolved. There are loads of ways that you can contribute and I hope to make students aware of all of\nthese opportunities.\nhave more student-focused content:\n- The Editor should investigate issues affecting\nstudents, as well as shine a spotlight on student\nactivities. By reporting events on campus in an\nobjective manner, hopefully students will realise\nImperial is exploding at the seams with extremely\ntalented people.\n- I\u2019ll ensure that the website is regularly updated. I\nknow the hard work required of felix Editors, but if\nelected I\u2019ll only have one shot at the job. It\u2019s important enough for me to give it everything I\u2019ve got and\nmore. I have no intention of letting the newspaper,\nor more importantly you the student, down.\nKadhim Shubber\nnom nom nom nom nom [sic]\nEsther Kang\nF\nirst of all, I would like to thank the current\nSabbatical Committee for bringing us a\nwonderful year. Also I would like to thank\nMartin Luther King, Priest Valentio and\nEason Chan for showing us love in this world.\nWe need love, and love binds us together. I often get asked of one question: \u201cHow do you feel\nabout London?\u201d My answer is, GREAT. This is such\na lovely city; everyone is very nice, and respectful\ntowards the every culture background. I believe\nthere are treasures behind every culture, and Imperial College should be the place where every\nculture joins together, so we can learn, appreciate\nand treasure the values behind different culture.\nTherefore, once I am elected, I will not only fight\nfor the rights for students, but also I will fight for a\nbetter culture communication environment in Imperial College. I have a dream, that students from\ndifferent culture background can really join hearts\ntogether, just like brothers and sisters.\nCount on me, for my determination and experi-ence. I was the year representative in first year. During my term, I act actively and responsibly, helped\nstudents solving issues, and represented students\u2019\nvoice to the department committee. My job was ap-preciated: I not only received those lovely appreciation emails at the end of my term, but also got\nelected to be the year representative again this year.\nTrust me, and vote me for Student Trustee.\nAt last, I want to say, I believe in Brother Chun.\nBig love.\nHoi Yeung\nI\n, Rhodri (although nominally a David!), believe\nthat Student Representation remains imperative in ensuring that our university\u2019s money\nproperly in our fee-paying eyes. Thus it requires\nsomeone who is pro-active, experienced and committed to seeing things through. I believe I have this\ndetermination and the ability to fight for the student\ncommunity: I have held Debating secretary, Law\ntreasurer, ICMUN publicity officer and Conservative external liaison officer in societies this year as\nwell as working with the ICIC. You may also have\nseen me around flyering for the charity Teach First\n(where I have a bag of sweets) postering for Herbert\nSmith LLP as campus manager whilst also volunteering with Pimlico and the Social mobility Foundation. This have given me a large range of experiences\nwhich will allow me to effectively represent what you\nwant most out of Imperial which includes good facilities and minimal monetary wastage.\nThus I pledge, should I be deemed worthy of elec-tion, to:\n1) Send out an email every 6 weeks updating you\nas to what is happening financially so you can email\nme saying what you agree and disagree with to allow\nme to effectively represent you.\n2) To fight for more funding of the humanities and\nto cease the cuts to the language department as this\nis a vital part of Imperial life.\n3) To reduce any wastage of funds on bureaucracy\nand non-essentials.\nDavid Oliver\nSTUDENT TRUSTEE ELECTIONS 2010\nFour positions available\n\n"

High quality, dreamily light cheesecake, oozing with creamy, caramelised and strawberry overtones.\nThere\u2019s something about Jak\u2019s Cafe\nH\naving finished an extremely satisfying meal\nat Jak\u2019s, I asked for a restaurant card. Oddly, the\nfirst thing that struck\nme was its slightly plush feel. But aside\nfrom my fingers being impressed by\nthe quality of this piece of card, my\neyes were drawn to the slogan of the\nrestaurant on its reverse which bore\nthe words \u2018Home Cooked Organic\nFood\u2019. I then mulled over the tastes,\nsmells, sights and sounds that I experienced during my pleasurable two hour\ndining experience, and concluded that\nJak\u2019s is much, much more than those\nfour simple words printed on a piece\nof black cardboard. At the time I didn\u2019t\nenvy the man who had to describe this\neatery on an area smaller than a credit\ncard, and as I write this article, I still\ndon\u2019t.\nThe food at Jak\u2019s was all about\nfresh, high quality ingredients, simply\ncooked in a caring manner, with no\nfuss. Added to this were homely, cosy\nsurroundings, with friendly, smiling\nstaff and a touch of South-Ken chic-ness and a hint of Mediterranean flair.\nAt face value, this eatery doesn\u2019t strike\nyou as anything special. But sit down\nand immerse yourself in its laid-back\nambience and it\u2019ll soon strike you that\nyou\u2019ve found a restaurant with that element of \u2018je ne sais quoi\u2019.\nSomehow, dining at Jak\u2019s makes you\nfeel in control. Ok, at other restaurants,\nyou are the one ultimately responsible\nfor your choices. Yet that caf\u00e9 touch of\nhaving the main dishes and salads on\ndisplay in their full glory does give an\nadded sense of reassurance. Available\nare a range of simply cooked fish, meat\nand vegetarian dishes, and a selection\nof around ten different salads. I decided to elect two classic dishes; beef\nlasagne and fish pie. The first was of a\nhighly accomplished standard; whose\nsoft pasta sheets, sandwiching layers of\nrich bolognaise-bechamel sauce, completed with a pleasingly crispy topping,\nwas as good as at any mid-ranged Italian eatery I\u2019ve been to. The latter didn\u2019t\nquite match the standards set by the\nformer, but its flavour combination of\nparsley and salmon were matched accordingly with the partnership of vel-This restaurant\u2019s slogan left Chris Sim pondering its true meaning when he visited this organic Chelsea-based eatery\nvet-like smoothness of pureed potato\nand the crunch of fresh pea. Acting as\na counterweight to these rich dishes\nwere the salads. Their tabbouleh salad\nwith its uplifting tones of mint and\nparsley and cleansing hints of lemon\njuice and their slightly Asian-esque\nsesame infused spinach salad provided\nthis lighter touch.\nJak\u2019s also places you behind the wheel\nwhen creating your own custom juices.\nUpon approaching the juice bar, one\nwill find a bewildering array of organic\nfruits available for blending. I was feeling slightly lazy at the time so I asked\nfor a recommendation, and within\nminutes a freshly blended concoction\nof orange, apple and carrot arrived in\na glass, complete with that delectable\nfreshly whizzed froth.\nAnother likeable aspect about this\nrestaurant is that it really does save\nthe best until last, provided that you\nmake the right choices. Their banana\nbread didn\u2019t quite live up to expec-tations, but more inspirational was\ntheir lemon tart. No, don\u2019t think of it\nas a tarte au citron, it\u2019s streets ahead\nof that. It is comprised of a light and\nrefreshing filling, whose zestiness\nwas not overpowering, all encased\nin a crumbly pastry casing. But even\nthis was about to be overshadowed\nby Jak\u2019s strawberry cheesecake, which\ndeserves all the plaudits it can get. Elegantly composed of a vanilla-infused\nfeather-light cream cheese filling, a\nbeautifully rich biscuit base oozing\nwith caramelised tones and topped\noff with a thin layer of strawberry-infused syrupy lining, this creation\nwas truly dessert making of the highest calibre. Somehow, despite the\nflavours possessing a deep richness,\nthis dessert was light on the stomach,\nmeaning that despite sensations indicating that my tummy was approaching maximum capacity, I was obliged\nto indulge in even more.\nPrice and portions-wise, Jak\u2019s is\ncomparable to some mid-ranged Italian chain restaurants such as Carluccio\u2019s or Strada, with mains priced\naround \u00a39-\u00a310, juices around \u00a33 and\ndessert around \u00a34. But the unique organic concept of Jak\u2019s, its chic yet cosy\nfeel and not to mention its home-like\nfood puts this restaurant miles above\nsuch chain eateries. So, to conclude,\nthere really is something about Jak\u2019s\nthat makes it well worth an indulgent\nvisit.\nParty like it is 1509 at the Medieval Banquet @ Ivory House\nHolly Cumbers took a step back in time and experienced more than just tastes from the Medieval era\nI\nf you want a unique night out\nthen I would definitely recommend the Medieval Banquet.\nThe location for this restaurant\ncouldn\u2019t be better. Being situated by the Tower of London, it truly fits\nin with the medieval theme and provides a perfect place for a stroll after\nthe banquet. However I was slightly\ndisappointed by the interior d\u00e9cor- I\nwas expecting candles and sawdust\non the floor (I may have high expectations there!). The whole price of the\nevening is \u00a345 per person but this includes free wine and beer during the\nmeal, a four course banquet and plenty\nof medieval entertainment. When you\nfirst arrive you are instantly haggled\nfor \u00a35 pounds to dress up in medieval\ncostume, but it is definitely worth the\nmoney and it just makes the experience more realistic.\nAlthough there is free wine and\nbeer- don\u2019t expect anything fancy, you\njust get your standard John Smith\u2019s\nwhich tastes like cheap wine (the usual student drink!). In order to get a refill you have to scream \u2018wench!\u2019 at the\ntop of your voice which was actually\nsurprisingly amusing. Throughout\nthe night Henry VIII demands the\naudience to raise their glasses and\nshout \u2018wassail!\u2019 (a medieval term for\ncheers).\nDespite this banquet offering a vegetarian option, I was disappointed by\nthe overall quality of food throughout\nthe meal. For the first course the meat\neaters got a selection of meat (ham,\nbeef and chicken) served with salad.\nI was told that the meat was quite\ntough, but apart from that it was fairly\ntasty. The vegetarian option however\nwasn\u2019t as nice; the vegetarian p\u00e2t\u00e9 was\ndressed with too much salt with other\nherbs, giving it a weird taste. In fact,\nI actually struggled to eat it due to its\nodd flavour.\nThe second course was slightly bet-ter. Meat eaters and vegetarians were\noffered the same vegetable soup (you\nhad to drink this out of the bowl, in\ntrue medieval fashion). The soup was\nserved with home-made croutons\nand warm bread (which I thought\nwas the best thing about this course).\nHowever, I thought the soup was a bit\nbland, it could have really possessed a\ngreater depth of flavour.\nThe third course was by far the\nbest course. Meat eaters were offered a joint of chicken served alongside vegetables. This was served in a\ncauldron, which was a novelty. I was\ntold that the chicken was gorgeous\nand those whom I was with enjoyed it\nto the point that they requested sec-onds. Vegetarians were given an onion and goats cheese tart- which was\nalso gorgeous (unfortunately I didn\u2019t\nhave the option of seconds!) it was\njust the right mixture of onions and\ngoats cheese and you weren\u2019t overwhelmed with pastry. However the\nvegetables tasted and looked as if they\nhad come straight from a tin!\nThe dessert was another let down\n(however you probably won\u2019t mind as\nthe chances of being too full by this\ntime are high). The last course seems\nmuch more appetising on their web-site; a \u2018rich fruit filled flan\u2019 should be\ntranslated to a \u2018slice of cold apple pie\u2019. I\nthought this was disgusting and again,\nit was more than a struggle to eat.\nI wouldn\u2019t go to this restaurant for\nthe food, but for the entertainment- it\ndefinitely made up for the meal. You\nare greeted by Anne Boleyn, Henry\nVIII and various musicians. All accompany your eating with their beautiful voices. Between courses you\nare treated to juggling, jousting and\ndancing. At one point I found myself thinking that this was one of the\nweirdest dining experiences I have\never had, for I really felt as if I had\nbeen transported back in time.\nFood: 8.0\nValue: 7.0\nService: 8.5\nAmbience: 9.0\nOverall: 8.0/10\n\n"

Familiar names such as\nex-CGCU President Mark MearingSmith appear alongside fresh blood.\n2nd year Chris Darby looks to become one of the youngest Presidents\nthe Union has had in recent years\nunless Biologist Alex Kendall can use\nhis position as a Union favourite to\nhis advantage and pip Darby to the\npost.\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies) is being contested between six\ncandidates and the list has drawn\nsome surprised reactions. The shock\nnomination of Adam Gill has been\nsaid to be dismissed as another hoax,\nafter Gill\u2019s \u2018joke\u2019 campaigns in previous elections. Question marks are\nalso hovering above Heather Jones\u2019\nhead as she\u2019s reported to not be in the\ncountry during the elections. Whether a campaign team will assemble on\nher behalf is yet to be seen.\nFelix Editor looks to be run uncontested by 3rd year Physicist Kadhim\nShubber despite last year\u2019s race for\nthis position tallying record voting\nnumbers for an Imperial College\nUnion election. Kang is expected to\nbe running a dead campaign. Shubber himself partly contributed to the\nthree-way race between himself, Zoe\nDobell and Dan Wan.\nManifestos for all the candidates\nare featured in the Sabbatical Election 2010 pullout in this issue of felix.\nAny student at Imperial College will\nbe eligible to\nvote from the\n9th of March\n2010 on im-perialcol-legeunion.\norg/vote.\nThis\nyear\u2019s Union Elections have been scaled down from\nprevious years\u2019, due to the tightening\nof budgets that the Union has come\nunder this past year. Candidates\nwere previously allowed \u00a3200 on\ntheir campaign, but are now limited\nto \u00a3150. Most of the money goes towards campaign paraphernalia such\nas sweets and pens which are given\nout to voters during the duration of\ncampaigning. Subsequently, the campaigning period before the voting\nwindow opens has been shortened by\nseveral days to around a week.\nHustings have also changed this\nyear. In previous\nyears,\na\nquestion\nand answer\nsession has been held in the JCR at\nlunchtimes during the campaigning\nperiod. This year it will take place\nin the Southside Social Space where\nvoters will be able to ask questions\none-on-one with candidates. The\ntraditional Hustings took place in da\nVinci\u2019s on Thursday this week, whilst\nthe Southside Social Space hustings\nwill take place on Tuesday the 9th of\nMarch.\nDespite the cutbacks this election\nhas seen, the sheer number of candidates means\nAs a record number of candidates stand for next year\u2019s sabbatical positions, Dan Wan\nreports on how the Union\u2019s biggest elections

In this kind of\nprimitive country, roads vanished into\nfields, then it was planned that we had\nto walk 8oo metres to reach the accom-modation. What was not planned was\nthat the car, with the keys of the hut in\nit, was an hour behind us. Indeed, the\nstrategy was based on the postulate\nthat \u201ccars are always arrive before minibuses\u201d. Walking on the path toward the\nshack, I wondered if English logic was\nevolved enough to understand that this\nassumption was now refuted by the\nexperiment itself. I was developing a\nnew \u201ccar-minibus\u201d paradigm when we\narrived at the hut and Jim\u2019s vomiting\nstopped my thoughts. It was actually a\nbeautiful red-pink vomit (after analysis\nit turned out that the red was due to\nthe ketchup of his burger).\nJim was very ill and half of us stayed\nwith him wrapped up in his sleeping\nand survival bags outside the hut, while\nthe others went back to the minibus to\nlook after the remaining kits and get\nwarm (cowards!). After a long astronomical contemplation punctuated by\nJim-is-still-alive checks, the others finally arrived. We more or less jumped\nstraight into our beds. The night was\nquiet apart from some unfortunate\nnoises from Jim.\nSaturday 7am; a wonderful unexpected English blue sky said \u201cgood\nmorning\u201d to us through the window\nfrom beyond a peaceful stream edged\nwith naked trees. Maybe it was the ba-nana, maybe I\u2019m getting used to this revolting concoction, but I found Alex\u2019s\nporridge not too bad.\nOnce this had cemented in our stom-achs, we ventured outside towards our\nchallenges, cruelly and remorselessly\nleaving the carrion of Jim as prey for\njackals in the hut. After one hour walk-ing, I saw Alex lengthily embrace Thea.\nAfter being ill the previous few days,\nshe decided to go back and kick the\njackals if they dared approach Jim. After going up a bit more I turned around\nto catch my breath and saw the tiny\nThea far away. Going back on the path,\nwith my face in the shade, \u201cI thought\nsuch is the hard rule of the Lake District, only the strongest can attain the\ntop\u201d.\nPast cairn after cairn, under the rising sun, we slowly reached the ridge.\nWalking now in the sparkling snow,\nthe view became more and more\nbreath-taking; it was an infinite grey-shading of mountains with lakes shining in the distance. We had our first\nlunch at the Old Man of Coniston\n(803 m.). Then on an undulating path,\nlots of \u201camazings\u201d, \u201cawesomes\u201d and\n\u201cOh my Gods!\u201d were exclaimed and\nlots of pictures were taken to update\nfacebook profiles and desktop backgrounds (even in the mountain, we are\nstill geeks). After the second lunch, we\nfound a nice slope to practice the now\ntraditional Fellwanderers sport that is\ntobogganing with survival bags. Different techniques were adopted: prone,\nsupine, head first, inside the bag head\nfirst, bob-sleigh style, two inside the\nbag, but most of the time we ended by\nspinning and being snow-covered. The\nthird lunch was taken at Wetherlan\npeak (762 m.).\nOn the way down to the town of\nConiston, I went into a cave and slew\na dragon, but nobody saw me. Then\nthe group split: Joe, Flavien and Rafal\nreturned straight to the hut to come to\nthe aid of Jim and Thea, because they\nlearned by text message that they were\nnow under vulture attack. The less\nbrave others, including me, went to a\npub in Coniston.\nAs my lips hurt and I had forgotten\nmy Labello stick, I looked for something similar in the shop and the only\nthing that I found was a little pot of\nVaseline. When I read on it \u201clip therapy\u201d, a flash of lightning went through\nmy mind and life had a new meaning.\nIndeed, in France we only use Labello\nstick for the lips, and for the bulk of\nFrench people, Vaseline is only used as\na sex-lubricant. So now I understand\nwhy this girl in the library was working\nwith a Vaseline pot beside her pencil\ncase. Proud of my new state of knowl-edge, I bought the pot without shame.\nAfter tea, coffee, chips or beer, it was\ntime to go home. Nothing happened in\nthe last hiking hour apart from these\nbloody anglophones mocking me because I put a \u201cs\u201d at the end of the plural\nof sheep.\nBack at the accommodation, Jim was\nstill not in fine shape but since Thea,\nFlavien, Joe and Rafal had killed all the\njackals and vultures, they had started\nmaking dinner. The hut was worth the\n800m hike , it was fitted for the kings\nthat we actually are: there was a big\nkitchen stocked with dishes, the bedroom upstairs was an aerial shambles\nof woody bunk beds where Mariko was\nin her natural environment, a business-class drying room and a vast common\nroom with a huge stove, a banquet\ntable and armchairs for everyone! An\nincongruous erotic journal was found\nby Nathaniel; the hot girls in it were\nperfect to light the fire. This bad joke\ndone, we had an excellent sweet and\nsour dinner as a celebration of Chinese\nnew year and several kinds of cake for\ndessert. Then the evening was a calm\nsea of conversations and book reading,\nsometime disrupted by an apparently\nbetter Thea, reading aloud some epic\nquotations from the log book. Lastly,\nmore and more people fell asleep on\nthe armchairs with the increasing temperature from the coal stove...\nSunday 7 am: bananas are definitely\nthe solution to making porridge ed-ible. It was snowing and yesterday\u2019s\nlandscape had turned white. Jim and\nThea were definitely better. But a nice\nsurprise was waiting for us when we\narrived at the minibus: the back-left\ntyre was flat. No shit, with the stochastic path of the day before! As a long\nfuneral procession, we followed Joe\ndriving the minibus back to a proper\nroad where Nathaniel changed the tyre\nin double-quickish time with his great\nskill as a Fellwanderers ex-president. It\nwas instructive because I learned that\nthe English actually need the theme\nmusic of Indiana Jones to change a\ntyre. Afterwards, we drove a few miles\n(what a stupid unit) by car or minibus\nto start a new hike. This time it was\nRafal who wasn\u2019t well enough to hike\nand who stayed in the minibus. Thankfully, today was too cold for vultures\nand jackals, but wolves and polar bears\ncould take over.\nSo we started a long, long, long ascent in the white. After checking for\na 3rd time that Simon was all-right\nand his family as well, I told him: \u201cWe\nare like two-dimensional men walking through a sheet of paper\u201d. He an-swered, \u201cYes, or it is like inside a ping-pong ball!\u201d We now had snow almost\nup to our knees.\nFinally after this 500m trek uphill, we\nhad a quick cold first lunch in the Peak\nof Blisco (705m). During the descent,\nThea, from the deep maze of her mind,\nasserted \u201cActually, down is the opposite of up!\u201d Alex and Patrick couldn\u2019t\ncatch this very profound thought, and\nsuperficial spirits that they are, immediately made fun of her.\nThe rest of the hike was enlivened by\nSimon juggling snowballs, the brave\ntwo Jim and Joe trying to ride their\nsurvival bags over The Slope of Death,\nAlex and Patrick playing baseball with\nicicles, the snowballs at the Battle of\nOxendale Beck River Bridge where\nmuch blood flowed, and an unavoidable sheep hunt.\nNathaniel, Joe and Jim went to pick\nup the car, the minibus, and Rafal who\nhad survived the bears, wolves and the\ncold. We waited lazily in a pub around a\nmassive wooden table, laughing about\nthis epic weekend. Because yes, it was\nactually done. When the minibus arrived we went back, without major in-cident, to London: such was our fate.\nImperial\u2019s ISoc prepare for Islamic Awareness Week 2010\nD\no you confuse your hi-jaabs and halals? Might\nyou mistake salat for a\nhealthy green side dish?\nBill, a film enthusiast\ndefinitely did. He had learned a lot\nabout Muslims from blockbuster hits.\n\u201cBefore uni I got all my knowledge\nabout Islam from movies and I also\ngained insight from reliable news networks like Fox\u201d, recalled Bill. \u201cHowever, my mind was blown when I went to\nIslamic Awareness Week 2009. Now I\nrealise that Muslims in real life are different to how they seem on the silver\nscreen- more like Fasting but not Furious LOL!\u201d\nThankfully, most Imperial students\ndo not think within the narrow confines that Bill did, nor do they share his\nquestionable sense of humour. In fact,\nit is the student body\u2019s open mindedness and capacity for intelligent\nthought that makes it possible for us\nto run Islamic Awareness Week (IAW)\nonce again for 2010.\nOutside of a university campus it\u2019s\nrare to find so many pensive Muslims\nfrom a range of different backgrounds\nin one place, so it\u2019s really worth coming\ndown to the SAF during lunch to check\nout the exhibitions they have prepared\nto get a small idea of the diversity we\nhave here on campus. This year\u2019s IAW\npromises to be a rich experience, taking you on a spiritual and cultural journey through centuries of Islam in just\none week.\nIC ISoc will also provide approachable Muslims on foot with a broad\nknowledge of Islam, spanning well beyond that of Sheikh Google and Imam\nWikipedia.\nThey will be available for stimulating\nchats, and to answer any of your burning questions from beliefs to beard\nmaintenance.\nSo come along next week to exhibitions (12-4pm in SAF), talks, Q&A\nsessions, gameshows and a PANTO\nto broaden your horizons, and also for\nbanterous laughs.\n\u2018We are like two-di-mensional men walking through a sheet\nof paper.\u2019\n\u2018Outside of a University\ncampus, it\u2019s rare to find so\nmany pensive Muslims\u2019\nJules Morand gets into the countryside with a bunch of lads, a tub of Vaseline and classic philosophy\n\n"

The highlight of their\nset was a band member leaping around\nmaniacally with a tambourine.\nConclusion: they were a typical\nsupport band and it was nice to\nbask in that.\nThe crowd still was not moved by the\nturbulence of the Big Pink and it was\na horrible experience to stand between\ncondemnations of \u201cshit\u2026get off!\u201d when\nyou just want the slamming sounds to\ncoldly pierce into you and hack you to\na crumpled mess on the floor.\nHowever it was lovely to find that\nthe standard act of going mental ensued once Bombay Bicycle Club were\nadopted for cheek-pinching and \u201cLook\nhow you\u2019ve grown!\u201d The grin stretched\nacross Steadman\u2019s face was the sweetest thing as the audience refused to\nstop endearingly screaming the chorus of \u2018Always\nBeen Like This\u2019 - definitely a\nmoment that the band were less likely\nto forget than the crowd.\nAt last, The Maccabees. They had\nmuch to live up to after BBC and\ndid not disappoint. After pounding\nthrough the main body of their set,\n\u201clegendary\u201d Orange Juice\u2019s Edwyn Collins became a sixth member. Although,\nI have to say I have no idea who he was,\nI was simply waiting for the beaute of\n\u2018Love You Better\u2019 and trying to make\nthe most of Orlando\u2019s pretty face before I could fight my way out of the\nmurderous asphyxiation.\n- Lily Le\nBrixton Academy\n20th February\nDetroit Social Club have kept me up at\nnight, sweating a cold sweat because\nI\u2019ve come to realise that most indie\nrock bands that I\u2019ve liked for the last\nten years sound exactly the same and\nreally aren\u2019t that good.\nTheir sparsely attended gig at Cargo, as part of the Shockwaves NME\nAwards Tour was the catalyst for this\nepiphany. The band, all 6 of them, put\non a show which mainly resulted in me\nnoticing that I\u2019d been standing on my\nfeet in the same spot for a long time\nand that my feet were starting to hurt.\nAt times they captivated and struck\na perfect balance between rhythmic\nprog rock and music that normal people like to hear. When their more experimental side shone through I actually started to enjoy myself; 3 beers and\nsome indie littered with bongo drums\nsure make for a good time.\nBut ultimately it never felt particularly fresh. They didn\u2019t take me somewhere that I hadn\u2019t been already, and\nif they had been mind-blowingly fun\nI might have forgiven them, but apart\nfrom the one guy who danced around\nlike a 4-year old (that\u2019s a compliment\nby the way) there wasn\u2019t much excitement going spare.\nWhich is what opened my eyes. Detroit Social Club aren\u2019t much better or\nworse than most indie rock bands that\nare hanging around today but unfortunately they haven\u2019t noticed that the\ngenre is old, tired and not interested\nin doing anything but watching Coronation Street and having a cuppa. But\nthen again, it was an NME Awards gig,\nwhich probably should have lowered\nmy expectations. - Kadhim Shubber\n\u2605\u2605\nDETROIT SOCIAL CLUB\nCargo\n18th February\n\u2605\u2605\nTHE NME AWARDS\nOnly dicks like the NME. Bigger dicks\ngo to the Awards Tour, the Awards, and\nrip open the special edition box to read\nabout The Maccabees in Sainsbury\u2019s\nbefore realising it\u2019s a pile of nonsensical\nrubbish, and that they would prefer to\nsave their eyes for microscopes.\nDespite the plethora of fantastic performances such as Kasabian with Noel\nFielding and the Biff with Marina, the\nrest of the ceremony felt contrived and\nmaterialistic. Although it is about celebrating the hard work of artists and\ngood music, the general air seemed\nmore to be along the lines of \u201cLook at\nthese pretty people who make sounds\nand look at us who fooled you into liking them. We\u2019re rich now, thanks.\u201d\nPlus, due to my absurdly poor music taste, I have to admit the fact that\nJarvis Cocker, Paul Weller and The\nSpecials were in one room at the same\ntime didn\u2019t phase me at all. Soz mate.\nI apologise if you were hoping for a\nreview more like \u201cOMG I saw Lily Allen in real life and she has MASSIVE\nknockers\u201d. I\u2019m sure if you watch it on\nthe telly you can see everyone\u2019s bits\nthanks to the presence of the endless\nnumbers of skin tight trouser pieces\nanyway. - Lily Le\nBrixton Academy\n24th February\nWINNER\nBEST &\nWORST\nDRESSED\nLady Gaga\nWINNER\nBEST\nNEW\nBAND\nBombay\nBicycle Club\nWINNER\nGOD-LIKE\nGENIUS\nAWARD\nPaul Weller\ns\nL\nI was excited about this gig, MEGA\nexcited. Girls\u2019 debut album was something that I ignored for a long while,\nand then disliked when I first listened\nto it, but then finally fell in love with\nharder than a victim of Stockholm Syndrome. For the entire month of January\nI literally just sang the line \u201cLaurrraaaa,\nbaby I\u2019m right hereeeee\u201d from their\nsong \u201cLaura\u201d in my head over and over\nall day, every day. By now you should\nhave gotten the general idea; I was\nMEGA excited.\nIt was packed out at Scala when I\narrived and after pushing my way to\na reasonable distance from the stage,\nand trying my best not to stand in front\nof some short angry girls I waited patiently for Girls to come out.\nAnd then he randomly and silently\nappeared. Lead singer Christopher\nOwens, with all his girly hair and a\nshadowing baseball cap crept onto the\nstage to sort out his guitar and most\npeople didn\u2019t even notice; the ones that\ndid just assumed that he was a roadie.\nHis unassuming demeanor threaded into the rest of the gig. The band\nopened with the afore-mentioned single \u201cLaura\u201d, a choice which felt like getting it out of the way so as not to keep\nthe audience waiting for it.\nBut as the gig went on, the word\n\u2018unassuming\u2019 began to be replaced\nwith \u2018unimpressive\u2019. The emotion was\nall there, don\u2019t get me wrong. Vocally\nOwens sounded like a wounded wolf\nand the simple power of the lyrics hit\nhome but honestly I kept thinking that\nthey sound a hell of a lot better on\nrecord.\nSo when towards the end of the\ngig, the other half of Girls, Chet \u201cJR\u201d\nWhite, started joking that they should\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nGIRLS\nScala\n23rd February\nOTHER WINNERS\nBEST LIVE BAND\nBombay Bicycle Club\nOTH\nBES\nBom\nBEST TRACK\nBig Pink - Dominos\nBEST ALBUM\nKasabian - West\nRyder Pauper Lunatic\nHOTTEST WOMAN\nKaren O\nHOTTEST MAN\nMatt Belamy\nBEST SOLO ARTIST\nJamie T\nThis is Jamie\nT. What a lad.\nWaaaayyy lads\nout on the\nlash!\nIn conclusion: all music awards are pointless, they always try to\nappeal to the masses but this is not what music is about\nhave been nominated for an award instead of The Big Pink (prompting some\nof the audience to start shouting obscenities in agreement - \u201cFuck Yeah!\u201d\nas always, a classic) I thought that even\nthough The Big Pink aren\u2019t amazing,\nthey are fucking good live. Which I\nprobably wouldn\u2019t say of Girls.\nBut then again, Girls\u2019 songs are designed for bedroom listening whenever you\u2019re feeling a bit self-pitying and\nwant to dream about suntans and bottles of wine on the beach. It\u2019s not the\nkind of music that\u2019ll inspire you to rock\nout (although those ever-present 16-year old indie prats that you find at all\ngigs trying to mosh certaintly tried to\nrock out; they failed). So if Girls want\nto play a gig at my house then \u201cFuck\nYeah!\u201d, but otherwise, I probably won\u2019t\ngo see them again. - Kadhim Shubber\n\n"

The more serious side of this\nrole involves ensuring that health and safety requirements are met\nacross all Union activities so that the organisation is compliant with the\nrelevant laws and College policies. The biggest date on the DPCS\u2019 calendar comes right at the start of term with the Freshers\u2019 Fair. The DPCS\nis responsible for organising the day, where each club is located and for\nimplementing a contingency plan should the skies open!\nE\nasy, my name\u2019s Adam, I\u2019m a final year\nphysics student and if it wasn\u2019t for the\nclubs and societies here at Imperial I\nprobably would have left by now. Over\nthe past three years, I, like most of you have realised that the two hallmarks of life as an imperial student is a shit load of work combined with a\n\u201cbelow-average-student-social-life.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s why I feel clubs and societies here are\nmore important than any other university, it allows\nus to meet people with similar interests and gives\nus an excuse to drink once/twice a week.\nIn my first year I was a member of the football\nclub and last year I was elected as Sponsorship Secretary, this enabled me to see the difficulties clubs\nfaced in terms of financing and how important\nbudgeting is. This year I have been an active member of STOIC and ICRADIO.\nMy current position as Welfare Campaigns Officer has offered some insight into the inner workings\nof the union, but I feel I have remained sufficiently\ndetached so as to still provide a fresh approach.\nAs DPCS I hope to:\n- Ensure all students are aware of the massive selection of clubs and societies on offer.\n- Be a friendly and approachable face to maintain\na healthy relationship between the union and all\nclubs/societies.\n- Examine the possibility of holding a Refreshers\nFair in the Spring Term; offering a chance for clubs\nto recruit new members, this would be particularly\nuseful for summer clubs/societies.\nAdam Gill\nH\ni, my name is Emma Beresford and\nI\u2019m running for DPCS. As a third year\nChemistry and Management student\nI have experienced several aspects of\nstudent life within both the RCS and C&G depart-ments. I am a highly active member of the hockey\nclub having been on the executive committee for\ntwo years as well as taking part in many other clubs\nand societies, IC radio and Snowsports to name\na few. After reading Jenny\u2019s blogs from this year\nI think it\u2019s really important for the DPCS to get a\nfully rounded view and experience of all the clubs\navailable at Imperial, taking time out to visit and\ntake part in events. In the next few weeks I\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ll see me at a lot more society meetings trying to find out exactly what you want from your\nDPCS\u2026 so beware\nWith such a vast range of clubs and societies\navailable to students at Imperial I think everyone\nwould agree that some of the smaller clubs are often forgotten even though they add so much diversity to the college. My aim as DPCS is to get people\ninvolved in as many clubs as possible while working\nclosely with Sport Imperial and the Sports Partnership, starting with the infamous Fresher\u2019s Fair and\ncontinuing throughout the year targeting all college\nmembers not just Fresher\u2019s. Clubs and Societies are\na fantastic way to meet people outside your direct\nfriend group and expand your interests, as a sociable and friendly person I hope [250 WORDS]\nEmma Beresford\nI\nam Heather, a 3rd Year Physicist. I am currently on my Year Abroad in Heidelberg and\nI want to be your next DPCS. I have been\ninvolved in the Union with a wide range of\nclubs from competitive sports like the Boat Club\nto Cheese Soc and the Fellwanderers, as well as\nSinfonietta, ICSE and the Choir. I have been a\nPresident, Secretary and Librarian of clubs and\nthese responsibilities have taught me how the\nUnion really works and, importantly, what can be\ndone to improve it.\nI want to create a Freshers webpage listing all\nclub events held in the first few weeks so no-one\nneed miss essential meet-and-greets, a shared inventory page to pool club resources and to hold\nmany more interclub events. I want to improve\nmusic at the Union by inviting clubs to run specific nights and improve the Arts at Imperial whilst\nsupporting our hard-working Sports clubs with\nthe equipment they need. Finally I want to create\na Buddy System for struggling clubs, whereby they\nwould be partnered with good clubs providing\nadvice and practical help to get them functional\nagain.\nPlease vote for me, putting an experienced, energetic and enthusiastic student in charge of your\nclubs next year. If you want to hear more of my\nplans, learn more about me or share your own ideas please visit my website at www.voteforheather.\nco.uk. Get involved, VOTE for Heather!\nHeather Jones\nT\nhe Imperial clubs & societies need change!\nThough most clubs are generally doing\nquite well, endless complaints from members of nearly all clubs & societies is a desperate sign that improvement is needed in many\nareas.\nI could blabber on at you all day about how I would\ngo about changing this and promise you the world.\nBut unfortunately, anything of the sort would just be\nempty promises. I will save you the effort of reading\nmore promising lies and instead, here are some facts:\nI am in my second year, doing biotechnology with\nmanagement, living in Beit at the moment and going\nfor the position of deputy president clubs & societies\n(DPCS).\nI suppose listing any experience you have had that\nrelates to your position is a necessary part of every\nmanifesto, so here goes: I have attended at least 30\ndifferent clubs and societies at Imperial, of which I\nhave attended at least 5 regularly at some point in\ntime. I have helped out some stalls at freshers fair in\nOctober (supervising freshers fair will be the hardest\ntask for every DPCS). I am currently founding a new\nmartial arts club at Imperial and have captained and\nfounded various teams in past schools.\nBut all these manifestos are only words and don\u2019t\nreally tell you who we really are. I suggest trying to\ntalk to us to find out a bit more about us before you\nmake your decision.\nAnd always remember: Live life to the fullest!\nPaavo Schafer\nH\ni. I\u2019m Joey and I am running for the position of DPCS. I believe with my experience\nand passion for efficiency and organisation,\nI make an ideal candidate. I am currently\nEvents Officer for BiochemSoc and have developed\nnumerous skills in the process- skills that I hope to\ntake into the Union.\nPlease check out my manifesto:\nEFFICIENCY: There is a lot of room for efficiency\nin the way that the Union is run. An example is the\nroom booking system- many experience difficulties in\nthis area.\nEXTRA TRAINING: for department societies is\nneeded making a conscious effort to support smaller\ngroups. Training in acquiring sponsorship will be the\nfocus.\n5 YEAR PLAN: I will strive to get to know the clubs\nof ICU by attending as many meetings and events\nas possible and help to draw up a 5 year plan for\ndevelopment.\nFRESHER\u2019S FAIR: My first main duty will be organising the Fresher\u2019s Fair. As Events Officer of BiochemSoc, I have had to develop my organisational skills. I\nalso have experience working in events as a part-time\njob.\nCOMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY: is\nsomething we lack at ICU. Regular meetings between\nclubs in the RCSU, for example, will be encouraged.\nORGANISATION: A centralised online calendar of\nevents going on in clubs & societies will be looked at.\nSUPPORT: for clubs that put the effort in. Some societies clearly put more effort into the club than others\nand this will be adequately supported.\nJoey Ra\n\n"

One\nhundred aftershocks were reported, eight of which were greater than 6.0\nand seiches were observed as far away as Louisiana. The death toll has\nreached over 800 and is expected to grow. 1.5 million people are displaced\nfrom their homes. Dawn to dusk curfews have been put in place and in\nConception, one of the worst hit cities, army troops clashed with looters.\nDiscontent with the government\u2019s handling of the situation seems to be\ngrowing, especially amongst those worst hit. In particular, food supplies\nseem to be erratic or non-existent in many places.

The German law was based\non a European Union directive that is now likely to be revised. Six other members have already refused to implement the directive. 35,000\nplaintiffs issued the complaint against the legislation, which the high\ncourt deemed to be incompatible with Germany\u2019s constitution and ordered the deletion of any current records. The court called the law a\n\u201cgrave intrusion\u201d into privacy that did not find a correct balance between safety and privacy. The ruling left room open for the law to be\nmore specifically defined both in purpose and scope.\nGermany\nS\npanish police arrested three men who are accused of spreading a virus to 13 million PCs that stole credit card numbers\nfrom its victims.\nMariposa, which means butterfly in Spanish, botnet is one of\nthe largest in existence and evaded antivirus software because its designers would change its software every 48 hours, making fingerprinting difficult for the antivirus firms. The virus targeted vulnerabilities\nin Microsoft Internet Explorer, MSN instant messenger, and installed\nitself onto USB keys attached to afflicted computers. Once installed\non a victims\u2019 machine, Mariposa would run as a keylogger, sending victims\u2019 keystrokes to the hackers. One of the three suspects was apparently found to have the personal information of 800,000 individuals.\nIn addition to stealing personal information, the attackers also rented\naccess to the infected machines to other hackers, often for use in denial\nof service attacks. Individuals, large corporations, and governments\nhave all been infected by Mariposa. Forty different banks have been\naffected.

    "content": "8 felix FRIDAY 05 MARCH 2010\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor\nBusiness Editor Sina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhat has happened to Class Warfare?\nBalancing recent articles in this section, Philip Avraam argues for expanding government intervention\nT\nhe issue of \u2018class war\u2019\nbriefly arose in our nation\u2019s politics a few weeks\nago after Gordon Brown\ncommented in December\nthat Conservative Party policy had\nbeen \u201cdreamed up on the playing fields\nof Eton\u201d. As usual, the real issues of\nclass and class conflict were carefully\navoided, in favour of a slagging match\nbetween politicians about who went\nto which elite public school. The only\nnoteworthy point to come out of the\nwhole fiasco, only because of what it\nshows about the people involved, was\nthe complete denial even of the existence of social classes by some Conservative Party spokespeople \u2013 most\nnotably, Kenneth Clarke (shadow business secretary) on the BBC\u2019s Question\nTime that week, a point on which he\nstood in splendid isolation among\nthose on the panel.\nMeanwhile, in the real world, the\nlast few weeks and months have seen\nan increase in industrial action across\nEurope. Workers have been told by\ntheir superiors that they must accept\npay-cuts and layoffs as part of the\n\u201cnecessary savings\u201d that companies\nand governments are seeking to make,\nso that they can get safely through the\nrecession. At the same time, an annual survey of boardroom pay run by\nthe Guardian revealed in September\nthat executive salaries had actually increased by more than twice the rate of\ninflation in the UK last year (2008/9),\nmore than three times the the rate of\nthe average worker, although bonus\npayments had seen a reduction.\nTo cite examples of the disproportionate impact of the recession on the\npoor is misleading because the phenomenon is universal. \u201cUnemployment hurts normal workers who do\nnot have the golden parachutes the\nfolks at the top have\u201d, commented Harvard economist Richard Freeman, referring to the US economy.\nThis recent wave of wage cuts and\nlayoffs for the poorest, must be placed\nin its proper historical context \u2013 that\nof a 30 year long assault on workers\u2019\nincomes, and sky-rocketing inequal-ity. A study from the National Equality\nPanel published in January is the most\nrecent to reveal this trend. Income inequality has been rising ever since the\nlate-1970\u2019s, with an accelerated rate of\nincrease during the 1980s. Real-term\nwage growth for lower-income workers has stagnated, and has occasionally\ndeclined over the period \u2013 despite the\n(rather tepid, by post-war standards)\neconomic growth. Put another way,\nthe extra income resulting from the\neconomic growth of the past 30 years\nhas gone almost entirely to those in the\nhighest income brackets.\nWhat has happened in the last 30\nyears? With the election of Thatcher in\nthe UK in 1979 and Reagan in the US\ndawned the era of a new economic ideology which has been operative all the\nway up to the present, loosely known as\nneo-liberalism (or sometimes, neo-lib-eral globalisation), which Nobel Prize\nwinning economist Joseph Stiglitz\nhas characterised as \u201cthat grab-bag of\nideas based on the fundamentalist notion that markets are self-correcting,\nallocate resources efficiently, and serve\nthe public well. [\u2026] [It favours] privati-zation, liberalization, and independent\ncentral banks focused single-mindedly\non inflation\u201d.\nThese policies have been enthusiastically supported by most western governments and their extremely happy\ncorporate sponsors, and have been\ncited by many leading economists as\nthe reason for rising inequality, as well\nas the increased depth and frequency\nof financial crises over this period.\nWhen governments, with enthusiastic support and sponsorship from\nbig business, implement policies that\nfavour the interests of business elites\nover those of the ordinary worker,\nthere can be no mistaking this as anything other than a thirty year long class\nassault, against which there has been\nlittle retaliation.\nGiven this sombre reality, why\ndoesn\u2019t the government implement\npolicies to ensure that those \u201cfolks at\nthe top\u201d with their \u201cgolden parachutes\u201d\nbare a larger share of the burden? The\nanswer was explained by economist\nMichael Porter of Harvard Business\nSchool at a London conference of 250\nglobal investors this month where, in\nreference to the 50p income tax rate\ndue in April for those earning more\nthan \u00a3150,000, he told the FT, \u201cIf it\ngoes any higher than that, and if that\nis perceived as being a long-term pol-icy, then I think that\u2019s going to create\nsome real problems in the long run\u201d, to\nwhich chief economist at the Institute\nof Directors added, \u201c... we need to get\nthe tax burden down to attract foreign\ninvestors. [\u2026] If other countries are\ncheaper, they win\u201d.\nWhat this shows is that in our liber-alised global economy, governments\nare extremely restricted in what they\ncan do, because of the increased power\nof international capital. A government\nwith ambitions to implement a redis-tributive tax which might benefit the\npoor, for example, can be, and often\nhas been, disciplined by international\ncapital through devices such as the\nthreat of capital flight and subsequent\nspeculation on currency. A 2006 article in the Washington Post estimated\nthat although France\u2019s \u2018wealth tax\u2019 has\nraised $2.6bn a year for the govern-ment, it has cost the country more\nthan $125bn since 1998 as a result of\ncapital flight. Capital flight and currency speculation have been cited as\nmajor contributors to the Asian crisis\nof the 1990s and various recent crises\nin Latin American countries around\nthe turn of the century.\nThe increased power of international\ncorporations within a deregulated global system has led to a tendency for\ngovernments to compete against each\nother to create the most favourable\ninvestment conditions possible in an\nattempt to lure in big business \u2013 meaning a drive towards lower taxes for the\nrich, and lower wages for the poor, an\ninternational tendency which radical\neconomist Robin Hahnel calls a \u201crace\nto the bottom\u201d.\nThings weren\u2019t always like this. From\nthe end of WWII until the 1970s the\nBretton-Woods international regulatory system restricted capital flight\nand currency speculation (among other regulatory arrangements), giving\ngovernments a certain space in which\nthey could implement social-demo-cratic policies, leading to the creation\nof things like the modern welfare-state, which has benefited so many.\nThis period, often referred to as the\n\u2018golden age\u2019 of capitalism, also saw, at\nthe same time, much higher rates of\ntaxation for the rich, and much higher\neconomic growth than has been seen\nin the last 30 years. High-levels of taxation and economic growth are not at\nall mutually exclusive, as we would be\nforgiven for believing if we listened\nonly to the economists representing\nthe 250 largest global investors at the\nLondon conference this month. Furthermore, the growth seen during\nthis period was relatively egalitarian\n\u2013 the income inequality gap reduced\nsubstantially.\nThe central problem of our time,\nthen, for those of us who still value\ndemocracy, is the centralisation of\neconomic power in the hands of\nunelected, largely unregulated private corporations, and their ability to sometimes undermine, and\nother times sponsor the policies\nof governments by their decisions\nabout where and when to invest or\nde-vest. It is the responsibility of\nthe powerful to negotiate a new international regulatory framework\nwhich restricts the power of private\ncapital, and goes some way towards\nreturning power to democratically\nelected bodies. Workers need not\nand should not accept the dictates\nof an international system in which\nthey have little democratic represen-tation. They have good reason to be\nangry, they have good reason to protest and good reason to strike.\nfelix writers are regularly beaten up by editor Dan Wan (third from left) and his\ngoons. Kadhim Shubber has promised to end the practice if elected Editor.\nThe Gini Coefficient is a standard measure of variance in incomes. The scale is from zero (everyone earns the same) to 1\n(one person earns everything). This graph for the UK is typical of the developed world over the timeframe shown.\n\u201cwage cuts and\nlayoffs must be\nplaced in proper\nhistorical context\n\u2013 a 30 year long\nassault on worker\u2019s\nincomes\u201d\n\u201cA drive towards\nlower taxes for the\nrich, lower wages\nfor the poor\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "7\nfelix FRIDAY 05 MARCH 2010\nI\ndiscovered the online analogy\nfor human suffering that is ChatRoulette this week. For those\nwho haven\u2019t been scarred for life\nby the experience \u2013 you know\nwhat the Daily Mail claims the Internet is like? ChatRoulette is like that. It\nstarts off pretty well \u2013 you log in and\nit displays a cheery welcome message\nand two little mini-screens. One is\n\u2018You\u2019 and the other is \u2018Stranger\u2019, a word\nthat has never been so appropriate\nin so many simultaneous yet distinct\nways. There\u2019s a friendly \u201cStart\u201d button,\nwhich immediately triggers a Pavlovian\nresponse you inherited from a childhood spent playing Super Mario Bros.\nso you click it. ChatRoulette then randomly selects someone else connected\nto their site, and displays their webcam\nfeed in the box.\n\u201cRandom\u201d, \u201cDisplay\u201d and \u201cWebcam\u201d\nare the key three words here, although\nthe key three words shortly become\n\u201cWanking\u201d, \u201cHairy\u201d and \u201cFreudian\u201d.\nBoth parties have a \u2018Skip\u2019 button which\nautoconnects them to another user,\nbut the man dressed as spiderman attempting to have sex with a melon\nis a bit too busy to press any buttons\nother than his own perverted ones, and\nfrankly the act of you pressing skip is\npretty futile unless you want to rejig\nthe scene and see a man dressed as a\nmelon having sex with a spiderman\ndoll, or something equally surreal.\nIt really does let the full horror of the\nInternet out, resulting in something a\nbit like Schrodinger\u2019s cat placed inside\nPandora\u2019s box; the next webcam both\ndoes and doesn\u2019t include a man indulging his genitalia, but the act of observing is seriously fucking discouraged.\nAnd I really do mean discouraged \u2013\nthe most distasteful cameras involved\nfaked suicide scenes piped into the\nwebcam feed from a movie file and\nset to loop. Then you skip to the next\ncamera and find a mother and father\nsitting down with their six year-old\nson, browsing the site, and you despair\nfor the human race.\nBut thinking about it awhile, I think\nit may have its uses. See, I reckon it\u2019s\na good way to weed out the weaker\ncandidates for the sabbatical positions\nthis year. What you do is, you sit every\nImperial student down in front of a we-bcam, and get the would-be President\nto skip through each and every one of\nthe cretinous, bellowing arseholes that\ninhabit the majority of this institu-tion. If, after the first three thousand\nor so, the candidate still gives a venti\nskimmed-milk toss about the welfare\nof the student body, then they deserve\nthe position, right then and there. My\nguess is you\u2019d be without a Union team\nfor a good half-decade, but it\u2019d still be\na worthy selection process.\nOr better still, use ChatRoulette as\na \u2018replacement\u2019 for the Union team.\nThink about it \u2013 need someone to\nmake a policy decision about the future\nof Imperial\u2019s ten thousand gurning formula chuffers? Log onto ChatRoulette\nand bing! Instant Union President. You\nmight think that the guy who\u2019s blacked\nup and is in the process of making\na smoothie in the nude whilst singing Sheena Easton songs might not\nhave much to say on the topic of the\nNUS, but I managed a perfectly cogent\nconversation with him. It just mostly\ninvolved questions about my sexual\npreferences, and there\u2019s nothing wrong\nwith that. I\u2019m sure Ashley Brown opens\nmost Union meetings with a quick enquiry about whether anyone\u2019s ever\ncopulated with their own siblings.\nThe way I see it is, the elections as\nthey exist today are functionally equivalent to ChatRoulette anyway. You log\nonto a website, click through a bunch\nof gurning faces that you\u2019ll never see\never again, and choose to give your\ntime to the one who disgusts you least.\nWhy not just save everyone the misery\nof pretending to care at Hustings and\njust take the next logical step?\nRhysDaviesisliving life in the fast lane\nI\nf God had wanted us to walk, he\nwould have given us legs. Given\nthe evidence, I guess he actually\ndoes.\nI say this because I\u2019m quite a\nfan of walking. It gets you from A to B,\nand even C if you\u2019re lucky. It\u2019s sometimes faster than public transport and\nis always cheaper. I am often pleasantly\nsurprised at where I end up when I just\nsit back and let my legs get on with it.\nThe scienticians say that it\u2019s good for\nyou too, so all is well.\nNow, I\u2019ve been walking for as long\nas I can remember, and quite possible longer. It\u2019s a fine way to travel\nand has always come naturally to me.\nTrundling along at four kilometres\nan hour was just fine for me. Ok, so I\nwore out my trainers a few times, and\nno-one could stand near me in an un-ventilated room, and sometimes I got\nblisters that could block out the sun,\nbut it was a small price to pay for my\nperambulations.\nBut recently, I\u2019ve discovered something better. It\u2019s like walking on fast-forward. It\u2019s walking-X, walking2.0. It\u2019s\nthe greatest innovation in the forward\ngait since the odour-eater.\nI\u2019ve discovered running.\nWith no previous experience, I was\nrelieved to find that the method was\nremarkably similar to walking: put one\nfoot in front of the other and repeat\nuntil you hit something. Admittedly,\nit\u2019s faster \u2013 quite a bit faster. The bone-rattling, bladder-busting break-neck\nspeeds of twelve kilometres an hour!\nI\u2019m surprised that this extreme sport\ndoesn\u2019t come with a safety helmet \u2013\nsomeone might get hurt.\nRunning holds many advantages\nover its tamer cousin, walking. For one,\nas I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s faster. This means you\nget places quicker. Which is rather useful when you\u2019re pressed for time and\nother abstract commodities. You can\neven rival the lightning-fast might of\nthe London Underground. Take that,\nBoris Johnson! Furthermore, you often work up a sweat doing so. And, as\nmany leading scienticians tell me, this\nis part of a phenomenon known as \u201cexercise\u201d which, for some strange reason,\nis good for you. In fact, they tell me\nthat the more you exercise, the better\nyou get at it. This means you can run\neven faster. Wahey! This means, given\nenough time, you can eventually run\nfaster than the speed of light. I\u2019m quite\nsure that\u2019s how Physics works.\nHowever, running does have its\ndownsides. You sweat, like I just said.\nThis has the unfortunate consequence\nof making your whole body smell like\na bull elephant\u2019s armpit. Most people\ndon\u2019t find this terribly endearing and\nyou probably want to avoid those that\ndo \u2013 zoo keepers and other undesira-bles. Also, just like more people are injured in rugby (and other real sports)\nthan in football, running takes a\nheavier toll on the body than the more\naugust walking. My father has been\nrunning for much longer than I have\nsince he is, so it happens, quite a bit\nolder than myself. After, I assume, centuries of chasing after schoolchildren\n(It\u2019s all right \u2013 he\u2019s a PE teacher), his\nknees have turned to dust. When the\nsurgeons replaced them, it was akin to\npouring sand out of your plimsoll after\na day at the beach. If God had wanted\nus to run, he wouldn\u2019t have invented\narthritis.\nBut ending my days in a wheelchair\nwouldn\u2019t be so bad. Stephen Hawking uses a wheelchair, as does Professor Xavier, and they both seem like\npretty groovy fellows. Who knows? By\nthe time my legs finally clap out, we\nmay have perfected robotic leg tech-nology; I could run even faster \u2013 and\nfire rockets at the same time! I must\nstart making ties within the MechEng\ndepartment.\nPeople started running as a means of\nescaping furry things with large teeth\n\u2013 like leopards. They kept on running\nwhen they realised the heady thrill of\novertaking other people. They\u2019re still\nrunning now, to that elusive bus in\nthe morning rush-hour, or from a very\npersistent leopard. And I predict people will be running for a long time to\ncome \u2013 so long as we still have buses\nand leopards.\nI\u2019ve heard it said that Life isn\u2019t a hundred metre sprint, and, unless you\u2019re\nUsain Bolt, that\u2019s probably true. So\nwalk, take your time, stop to smell the\nroses. Just one word of warning:\nWatch out for when I smoke you in\nmy running shoes!\nAngry Geek shows his all on ChatRoulette\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it said\nthat Life isn\u2019t a\nhundred metre\nsprint, and, unless\nyou\u2019re Usain Bolt,\nthat\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cIt really does let\nthe full horror\nof the Internet\nout, resulting in\nSchrodinger\u2019s\ncat placed inside\nPandora\u2019s box\u201d\n700-900 words with a mugshot. What are you waiting for? comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"
