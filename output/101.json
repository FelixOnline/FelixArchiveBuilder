    "content": "FELIX NO PLACE LIKE HOME SIM'S COLUMN BACK TO THE BU IL PINGS When the return of the Union to\nit sold home was postponed until January 14th it was thought that even\nat the slow rate of progress being\nachieved, there should be ample time\nfor the ground floor and the rest of\nthe eastern half of the building to\nbe finished. However, there seems to\nbe no end to this tragic story, and\nsome time during the Christmas vaca-tion the heating arrangements for the\ncloakroom and ground floor entrance\nhall were completely re-organised\n(surely this could have been done any\ntime in the L'^ st two years?) Thi3 involved knocking holes through eighteen\ninch walls and in the floor, and set\nback the cloakroom by several weeks.\nSo much for set-back number one.\nSet-back number two came when, although\nthe Union had made a precise and det ailed list of notice-board requirements no less than eighteen months ago,\nit was discovered in the Planning Office\nthat none had been ordered. Hence the\npresent temporary arrangements, hastily completed just before the start of the\nterm.\nExperience with t ne Refectories,\nConcert Hall and Bar has shown that\nthe only way to produce any marked:\nprogress in the work is to insist on\na certain deadline and move in whether\nthe workmen have finished or not. Even\nthen a great deal seems to be left unt il the very last minute. For instance\nduring the vacations two cork floors had to be laid and the floors to the\nConcert Hall and table-tennis room had\nto be sanded and treated for two or\nthree days. It was arranged that this should be done between January the 2nd and the 10th. Despite frequent appeals\nby tii e college this work did not begin\nuntil the 10th and was not finished unt il the 17th. The hand-rails to the\ncentral staircase make another sad\nstory. Tne holes into which these are\nfitted were originally made in the\nwrong positions so th jy had to be filled up and chi'yoe d out in the right ones.\n'T 'HE BAR ( continued.) the rost rid n( one of the stools) and called on the Student Orator, Andy, to read the Ode\n( reproduced on another page)\nspecially written for the\noccasion, by the I.C. bar d....ex student, R. P.L instead was invited to draw the\nfirst pint( qualification being his management of a tea and bath bun stall in Hyde\nPark during the General Strike of1926). With the formalities over,\nthe bar soon assumed the\nr roper aspect of a meeting place for thoughtful discussion, mirth and sport. The only thing needed to complete the evening was Ted ts hind the bar>\n\"but, as this could not be, every u o dy signed a petition wishing him a\" \u2022 p \u00b0ed y return. Other inexplicable and mysterious\nevents have occurred in the top-floor\nrefectory. The rough concrete floor was\nfitted with metal clips to receive\nwooden battens along w hio has trip floor can be laid. Then a vast number\nof wood blocks were delivered. There\nfollowed a period of inactivity( during\nwhich all enquiries received evasive\nanswers), and then the clips for holding wood battens were covered with a thick layer of cement on which wood\nblocks can be laid. This layer of\ncement is at present drying out (a process which takes about two weeks)\ns \u00bb the opening of this refectory is still longer delayed.\nAlmost every day something new\ncrops up. The ventilation of the\nkitchens, ser very and wash-up was\ncompleted during the vacation. At\nfirst its effect was to produce a howling draught (head-high) past\nthe unfortunate people working behind the counter and in the wash-up. These two draughts met somewhere near the hot-plate in the\nkitchen. Hence cold food was combined with indignant refectory staff suffering from headaches and pain3 in,the back. However, assurances have\nbeen made that these are mere teething\ntroubles with the new system and that\nall will soon be well. A serious\nsuggestion that wind eddies round the\nAlbert Hall are responsible for dire c ting a draught into the ser very skyl ig ht has been laughed to scorn.\nBar conversation has lately been\nmore concerned with the internal decorations of rooms that are finished\nrather than the general slowness.\nEveryone has his own ideas on this sort of thing: a few hasty personal\nimpressions are that the concert hall and dining hall are good, the lower\nrefectory is awful, the arm less chairs\nin' the lounge are cheap and uncomfortable and the Bar is excellent. The\nopinions and ideas of the buildings'\nusers are invaluable and interesting.\nSo what do you think? A.K.IN MY LADY' S CHAMBER There is some talk of the numerous\nsecretarial colleges in the vicinity being oom bin ed and given a status equivalent to ourselves - shall we live to see the day when there will be a Royal College of Sees.?\nTalking of inhibitions carnivals are what you make 'em! And\nthere were far too many people who\narrived at the last one as if it were\na supper-dance - the decor's pretty lurid, let's match it with the costume.\nAnd costume need not be involved or\ntime-absorbing - never has an \" alice band\" looked so redundant as on the\nhead of well, guess?\nThe wind whispers that our debating chairman of the Social Clubs\nCommittee is becoming musical - heard\nto say \" letS. C.C. stand the loss, the Musical Society must have an\naudience ...\"\nWhy, oh why, can't people get\nthings right? The Conservative H.P. in last term's debate on the Middle\nEastern policy called us the Imp e rial Institute; our rival, \"The\nTimes\", repeated this insult in a critique of \"Loftur\"; Brian Oggithe Imperial scribe - wrote to the\nRadio Times to correct them on a quiz game in which they had mentioned Jezebel - and the printed letter referred to the Guilds' mascot as Bob.\nThe blue Fiat belonging to Andy Levine\nwas featured in the January issue of\nMotor-Sport - and attributed to a damned art student; Why, in this year\nof learning, 1956, can't they get\nthings write?\nWe are told that sin\"e the New\nSenior Common Room came into use,\nonly black coffee is sold in the\nUpper Dining Hall. While this is admirable after Carnivals and\nother orgies, on normal(?) days j a little milk would be appreciated.\n. Reliable rumour has it that on Feb. 1 5 th. Lulu and the Zulu are to perform a\"Fa naga lo\"in aid of the Mines; black coffee would then be appreciated. At the time of going to press, we\nhave heard that the writer of the letter on Page ? , has been invited to\nprove his drinking ability in the Bar\non Wednesday (30th.).'. Ve hope that\nthey will soon be out of hospital.\nHere's to a sordid New Year - may\nall your dirty, rotten plans materialise\n- and may the column be within earshot\n(as the lights are not likely to be on).\nEditor's note:\" Nelson\" has\nrecently changed his identity, and, being an engineer, de sig ned his own column( q.T..).

This occasion when the audience enlivens the Dramatic Society' s performance in their own fashion, is howe vera long established tradition. Defending the production were Dirty Dick and his Icelanders. Attacking these exhibitionists were about 100\nminers and their supporters aided by guitar, tape recorder and loudspeaker. There was a ge'n tle man w no at Intervals displayed cards be a ring instructions such as 'Boo',\n'Cheer' and 'Free Noises' which were enthusiastically obeyed\nby the audience. Sundry wits at the back of the hall regularly Interrupted the characters with sage advice and perspicacious comment. Sound effects which the Dram.

Instead of entering into more\ndetail it is enough to say that this theatrical battle. ended in an honourable victory for both sides and all who took part spent a most enjoyable evening. PY TH A GOR ANALYSIS. As stated with the clues the Py th ago ram must be solved twice. The first solution was in the numbering of the clues. The jump from6 to10 indica ted that the sept i mal system instead of the decimal system of numbers was used.\nHence the highest number\npossible was 7 - 1 , i.e.2400(6666 in these pti mal system)\nand the lowest V3\n, I.e.343(1000). Once this solution was ob-tai ned the final solution was\ns Imple.\nConsider clues1,3, and 4,\nJ( ac) , a, a Taking clues3, and 4, we\ncan draw up a table showing values for ac and ab c based on values of a; bearing in mind the following points:1. a^l, since no power of1 reaches4 figures.2. ab+ca>l( ab+ca1, if b&c l).3. ac is a product of a.4.343t a*t, a \u00bbb,c<2400 \u2022a ac ab+c2109,10,11366,7. fulfil the necessary conditions.

So a2,b=3, and c6 It Is possible to arrive at\nthe above solution without arriving at the first, but of course the numbers will not fS it the square across and down.\nEXCELLENT PRODUCTION\nOne of the big events at the. ems.\nof last term was the pro duo iT ion by I.C.

For two groups of opposite N values the attraction in or eases continuously with the number of units.\nIf two such, groups gravitate towards\none a not hexf there will be a tendency\nto split up' into neutralized couples.\nWhan such a oo up le is formed, a be-oom es small for both units and the repulsion of each for any other units\ntends to become very large. The couple\nwill therefore seek a spot away from\nothers. .\nVarious other properties o an be\ndeduced from the above equations but\nwhat practical steps must be taken for the optimum results?\n4\u00ab. It is generally considered by\nthose who view this problem without\nthe necessary scientific detachment\nthat such a dynamic system should be\nneutral is ed into stable couples as\nquickly as possible. This can be\nquestioned, but we will assume this as a working hypothesis.\nWe must therefore achieve the\nfollowing results: \u2014\nI.f a a e 'acre \" i ol \u00a3>ru\u00bb 5 eve* nlm\nA. Any unit in a group must be\nforced into isolation. A group must therefore be\nattacked by several men at once\nthus leaving no condensation nucleus.\nB. The isolated unit must be\nbrought into contact with one of\nthe opposite charge.\nThis is normally done by\nthe request for a dance. Other\nmethods are known.\nC. The unit oust be neutral is ed and removed as soon as pos-sib le. For optimum results, the two\nunits must get close together far as\nlong as practicable.\n5. I will end with a plea for a more\nscientific approach to the a e problems:\nI have heard that some units attend in order to enjoy themselves. This should\nbe strongly di so our aged. G,A.y. "

After observations at vast expense over a long period of time,it\nhas been observed that groups of people at dances obey laws which can\nbe explained by postulating certain\nforces between persons (termed units in this report). In order to do this a value known as the \"Charge\" or \"Freedom number\" is allotted to any\none unit. This measures the amount\nof freedom any unit has and it also\nindicates the sex.\n2. The charge has the values\nO cs * + l for a female, and\n0 > \u00bb 5 - l for a male unite. g. for an unattached female\nthis has the value of +l, and for a girl who agrees to leave the dance\nearly the value would be close to zero.\nThe loss of charge depends very\nmuch on the time of proximity to a unit of the opposite charge. It will therefore depend on the number of\ndances the unit has had. This may be\ndiscussed in a later report.\n3. The attraction between any unit\nand a group can be given by the ex-press ion: F=AN2s2 ETf5\nwhere\nA,B= the distance between the\ntwo bodies (metres)\nthe charge or freed cn number\nthe total charge of ine\ngroup\nconstants.\nThe first part of the expression\nshows the effect of the need for companionship between (say) 2 girls or a girl and a man.\nThe second term measures the\ninnate repulsion between 2 girls and\nthe attraction between two members of\nopposite sexes.\nThus it can be shown that al though there is a strong attraction between unit of the opposite charge\nthere is also an attraction between\nsimilarly charged unit3.

AND THE P.O. BAR BEER\nBear31*. Despite strong opposition\nfrom local education authorities, many I.C. students must\nfind it a financial necessity to work for some, if not all, of the time during the va o ation p In this connection, it has be come a habit with many students to work at the General PostOffice as temporary postmen\nduring the pre Christmas period of the Christmas va o ation. In 1 9 5 5 , t ne Michaelmas term\"\nended on the16 Deoember.maki ng PostOffice work Just possible. This year. however, term did not end until the20 December when, with only4 \u00a3 days of their rush remaining, the Pest Office are not prepared to ft n^ age staff. Ho other college of any s it* finds it necessary toei ten fl their Michaelmas term until the \u00a30 December;the average coming\ndown date for the whole of the University is the13 December.\nSurely it is possible to shorten the long summer vacation by one week in order that the term may end atleast ten days before Christmas. Perhaps th os \u00ab\ndeciding term dates for I.C. will do something about it in future years, whan they find their s ard s and parcels arriving after chr iata a a. Tours faithfully, Anthony J. Wright. Dear Sir, While rejecting the absurd letter of Mr Charles in the last issue of Felix as rid i cul Wo us non sence, the union author \u2122\ni ties might just as well turn the new bar over to the community hymn singers unless some- Jfc\nthing is done about the stand w ard of beer served there. The\nbrand of beer at present dis'pensed, though no doubt very^ delectable to some palates, v seems to lack the flav eur that most habitual tipplers prefer. While there has been a certain improvement in the murky fluid we received last year, the only Jk\ngenerally acceptable solution \u2122\nis to return the present brand to the river whence it came,\nand change to a selection of' J. the be stales of the Country \u2014 if\nY** ng* rs,F l*w*r s and W* tn*y*.'I may add that my only interest in these beers is gas trono ml cal and not financial.^ Yours in thirsty anticipation,0.

JOHN WALKER\nMembers of the College will have\nheard with great regret of tho j death\nof Mr. John Walker, Deputy Registrar of City and Guilds College, who died in the Royal Sussex Hospital, Brighton,\non the 9th Deoember.\nMr. Walker, affectionately known\nas \"Johnnie Walker\" by generations of Guildsmen, was born in1895 and, apart\nfrom his ser vio e in the Royal Flying Corps during the first World War, he\nserved the College continuously since\n1910. He was appointed Assistant Reg is t rar in1927 and Deputy Registrar\nin1946. Johnnie Walker devoted his whole\nlife to the work of the College and\nhis unfailing good humour and willing ness to help won for him many friends,\nboth students and staff. He was ex1tremely popular with every generation\nof students; on numerous ooo as ions he\npresented the Engineers Field Cup, and\nhe was a member of the Links Club. In his spare time he was a keen gardener\nand musician,and for some years was a member of the Handel Society.\nMr. Walker had an extraordinary\nmemory for the names and records of\nOld Centralians and had for many years\nbeen of great as si3ta no e to the Old Centralians Association in an honorary\no a pao it y. His death is a great loss to the Imperial College and to Old Central ian s in all parts of the World.\nCOMPORT AND CONVENIENCE\nDear Sir, Whilst the union buildings are now inevitably in a rather chaotic state, seemingly surprisingly little imagination has been used in furnishing the Snack Bar and the Ayrton Hall lounge. In contrast the Ayrton Hall lounge now resembles a desert fringed by a most uncomfortable oasis. The large armchairs and settees which have been placed in the former, restrict the number and comfort of eaters and hinder the mobile staff. Since the\"' Union lounge can hardly be expected to provide sufficient accommodation for students, and in the short lunch hour many R.C.S. students stay up at the Ayrton Hall end, surely it would be more\nsensible to leave the larger furniture there and place the present chairs in the Snack\nBar thus providing comfort without restricting space? Yours sincerely, Rosemary Melville.
