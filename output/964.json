    "content": "'eat ure30 April 1993 Felix 964\nEasy like Sunday morning...\nAlex Taverner, a second year chemist at IC ran this year's London\nMarathon. Hoping to raise \u00a31,200for TUSK FORCE, he retells the story\nof his exertions below\nIt's the Big Day. Oh shit, why am\nI doing this? This is possibly the\nsecond most stupid thing that I have\never done - the first was turning up\nfor the Liverpool Marathon last\nyear. Oh well, it's too late to back\nout now and besides, I'm running\nfor charity this year. I finally get up,\nOh God, it's dark hundred hours.\nI got to the start early and froze\nin the cold and wind - who says that\nBlackheath is pleasant on a Sunday\nmorning? At 0730hrs? The number\nof keen faces around me is\nappalling; Are they stupid? Are they\nsuicidal? The Elite race started and\nwe waited around for ours, absent\nmindedly adjusting shoes, running\nnumbers and frozen appendages.\nThe whistle blows, and we all\nrespond by not moving for two\nminutes whilst those in front of us\nstart running... .three minutes later\nwe cross the start line.\nThere are water stops each mile;\na bit of quick mental arithmetic 26.2\ntimes 250ml= about 6.5 litres to\ndrink. How much are we going to\nsweat?\nThe first half goes easily; at the\nhalf way point I see the clock at 1\nhour 24 minutes. Subtract 3 minutes\nfor the start, multiply by one and\na bit, equals about 2 hours 50\nminutes. Brilliant! Mile 16 comes\nand goes, and then so do my legs.\nCramps set in for the duration and\nby Mile 18, I'm on time for 3 hours\n10 minutes. The cramps get really\nbad by Mile 20 and I have already\nseen lots of people dropping out\nbecause of them; the winds around\nthe Isle of Dogs did not help. I wave\nto Mike (him with camera) a few\ntimes then get back to the matter in\nhand and promptly trip over a drinks bottle. A few more people\nwave as I go by and I grin to them.\nI 'll be back...\nThe Embankment, Trafalgar\nSquare, The Mall - almost home!\nI see the fountain outside\nBuckingham Palace and nobody's going to stop me now! Top gear -it takes six minutes to complete the\nfinal mile and my legs are giving\nway; they're shagged. It's time for\ntea, medals and hospital is ation. After recovering, I took an hour\ncompletely failing to find the\ngorgeous young lady who came to\nsee me finish this race (it later\ntranspired that I kept looking the\nwrong way when I went past her\nover Westminster Bridge!). The\nrace over, I stay to cheer home a few more hundred mad, impetuous\nfools and go home. Oh well, 3\nhours 27 minutes hard work and it's all over for another year. The true\nhorror comes later when I tend to\nmy feet and find out that I have\nripped the muscles in my legs to\nbugger y. Anything in a good cause\n(well, nearly...)!\nThanks to all those who helped\nme train, sponsored me and came\nto see me run.\nSpecial thanks: Cathy, Mat., Jonty,\nMike, Emma, Alison, Phil(i), Rachel, Jane and the Felix crew.\nSTOP-PRESS: Just wait until the\nBerlin Marathon later on this\nyear.....\nOur hero striding through the pain barrier.\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "N ews\n30 April 1993 Felix 964\nFree radical\nby Declan Curry\nThe prize for this week's Felix\ncompetition has been sponsored by\nWilliam Waldegrave, the Science\nMinister. In a call for better\nunderstanding of science, Mr Waldegrave told reporters in\nBrighton that he would give a bottle\nof vintage champagne to anyone\nwho can tell him what the Higgs\nboson is, and why they want to find\nit.\nEntries must be on one side of a single sheet of A4 paper, and must\nbe posted to William Waldegrave,\nChancellor of the Duchy of\nLancaster, Office of Public Service\nand Science, Cabinet Office, 70\nWhitehall, London, SW1A. Entries\nmay also be left with Rose or Jonty\nat the Felix office, for faxing to Mr\nWaldegrave. The closing date for\nentries is 1 June 1993. The\nchampagne will be provided out of\nMr Waldegrave's pocket.\nAn interview with Professor Tom\nKibble, a former Head of Physics\nat Imperial and one of the\ndiscoverers of the wretched particle\nis on page 9 of this week's Felix.\nA Waldegrave-friendly answer\nform will be printed in next week's Felix. Order NOW at your local\nUnion office.\nWhile stocks last.\nJobs flop\nby Declan Curry\nUnemployment among Imperial\nCollege graduates is rising more\nrapidly than at other colleges,\naccording to figures just released.\nDespite this rise, the figures show\nthat unemployment among\nImperial's graduates is still much\nlower than for the country as a whole.\nOfficial figures issued jointly by\nthe Government Statistical Service\nand the Department for Education\nshow that, nationally, 13.2% of\n1991 graduates were still\nunemployed at the end of December\nof that year. At the same point in\n1990, only 8.8% of 1990 graduates\nwere believed unemployed.\nMeanwhile, Imperial College\nPlanning Unit figures show that\n5.8% of 1991 Imperial graduates\nwere 'seeking employment' at the\nend of December 1991. Only 3.3 %\nof Imperial's Class of 1990 were\njobless by Christmas of 1990. This\nyear-on-year percentage change of\n75% for Imperial graduates is\nconsiderably higher than the\nnational 1991/90 percentage change\nof 51%.\nFluttering millions Heads Screwed\nby Declan Curry\nHealth Secretary Virginia\nBottomley, facing another storm\nover the Tomlinson Report, has\nopened a mobile cardiac laboratory\nat St Mary's Hospital.\nThe heart unit, the first such\nfacility within the National Health\nService, will be used to carry out\nheart tests at local hospitals. Mrs\nBottomley said the unit will help the\nNHS in London 'meet the challenge\nof providing a more accessible\nservice for patients.'\nMeanwhile, doctors have claimed\nthat \u00a3170 million extra money\npromised by Mrs Bottomley for\nLondon patient care is a 'myth'.\nMedical journal 'Pulse' reports that\nmoney for implementing the\nTomlinson plans for London health\ncare is being diverted from other\nparts of the country. Mrs Bottomley\nsaid in February that the \u00a3170\nmillion would be 'additional\nexpenditure on capital projects\nwhich will bring London's primary\ncare services up to an appropriate\nstandard.'\nDr Peter Scholar, a Camden GP\nand member of group charged with\nintroducing the Tomlinson Report,\ntold IC Radio that after meeting\nDepartment of Health officials he\nhad 'no idea where the money was\ncoming from'. Dr John Chisholm,\nGP negotiator at the British Medical\nAssociation, said that the medical\nprofession had been dealt a 'three\ncard trick'.\nby Andrew Tseng, News Editor\nProfessor H Worthington has been\nappointed Head of the Department\nof Geology, succeeding Professor\nR Selley. His term of office extends\nfrom 1 July 1993 to 31 August\n1998.\nOther senior staff announcements\nsee both Professor W Wakeham and\nProfessor I Aleksander, having\ntheir appointments extended to 31\nAugust 1996. Professor Wakeham\nis currently the Head of the\nDepartments of Chemical\nEngineering and Chemical\nTechnology whilst Professor\nAleksander is the Head of the\nDepartment of Electrical and\nElectronic Engineering.\nThe Science and Engineering\nResearch Council (SERC) says it\nhas been 'screwed to the wall' by\n'tight' Government funding. The\nclaim was made after the Council\nrefused funding to Professor Sir\nGeoffrey Wilkinson, the Nobel\nprize winner still working at\nImperial's Chemistry Department.\nProfessor Wilkinson applied for\n\u00a330,000 to pay for a post-doctorate\nresearcher, chemicals and\nequipment. Sir Geoffrey, who won\nthe Nobel Prize in 1973, says he\nsent the rejection slip to his MP. The SERC says that it can only\nafford one third of chemistry\nprojects submitted for funding.\nBlatch to the drawing board\nby Declan Curry\nAn Imperial Governor was part of\nan academic ambush which last\nweek forced a headlong\nGovernment retreat on its latest\nschools Bill.\nLord Adrian, a Crown-appointed\nmember of Imperial's Governing\nBody, told Education Minister\nBaroness Emily Blatch that\nGovernment plans to extend the\npowers of Education Secretary,\nJohn Patten, were 'beyond the\nscope' of the new Education Bill.\nThe Imperial Governer added that\nhe was 'unsure' of the Education\nSecretary's motives.\nThis attack, and a threatened\nConservative revolt forced the\nMinister to rescind her proposals to\nextend the Education Secretary's executive powers over education in\nEngland and Wales. The\nclimb down took place in the House\nof Lords, during the Committee\nstage of the 1992 Education White\nPaper.\nAlthough the Bill re-organises\nprimary and secondary education,\nuniversity chiefs became embroiled\nin a row with the government after\nJohn Patten, the Education\nSecretary, introduced a new clause\nto the Act last February. Known as\n'Clause One', the new wording\ninstructed the Education Secretary\n'to exercise his powers' over\npublicly funded bodies which 'carry\nresponsibility for education in\nEngland and Wales'.\nAcademics were outraged at what\nmany saw as a secretive\nGovernment attempt to restrict\nacademic freedom, and to dictate\nwhat they could teach. University\nvice chancellors said that they were\n'puzzled and concerned' by the new\nclause, and demanded the 'specific\nexclusion' of higher education\ninstitutions from the new schools\nbill.\nThe Government front bench\nclashed with senior Conservative\nand Liberal Democrat peers, who\nsaid that the new law would 'leave\nuniversities vulnerable to\ninterference by the Government'.\nRebel peers were joined by\nacademics in the Upper Chamber,\nwho expressed concern about\nacademic freedom. Academic\nfreedom was last discussed in the\nHouse of Lords last year, when the\npeers defeated Government plans to\nallow the Education Secretary to\nimpose conditions on university\ngrants, and to link university\nfunding to the use of academic time.\nOne peer, Lord Simon of Glaisdale,\nsaid that Clause One was the\nGovernment's fourth attempt since\n1988 to undermine academic\nfreedom.\nBaroness Blatch told the peers\nthat she was withdrawing the clause\nin order to meet university fears.\nEarlier, the Baroness had insisted\nthat the plans did not give the\nEducation Secretary new powers\nover universities.\nPage 2\n\n"

No problem\nI thought, get up, cycle across\nLondon, point and shoot, what's so\nhard about that? Nothing really,\napart from the start of the marathon\nis 9.00am, the other side of\nLondon, the other side of the river,\nin zone five; it might as well be the\nother side of the world.\nI set my alarm for 6.30am,I ignore it and go back to sleep.\n7.15am, oh shit, I'm late already\nand I'm not even up yet -I get up,\nI grab my camera, lenses, film,\nmore film and a bag to put it in and\nset off across London on my bike.\nI get to college and wait for Jonty,\nits 8.00am. Having said he would\nlike to come he could have the\ndecency to turn up. 8.15am; No\nsign of Jonty, I cannot hang around\nany longer, leaving a message for\nhim, I set off across London.\nCrossing the river at Blackfriars,\nI manage to pick up the marathon\nroute marked by a blue line at the\nfar side of Tower Bridge. At least\nnow I know I am going in the right\ndirection. I get to the Cutty Sark at\n9.00; its packed already, everybody\nin London seams to have decided\nthat this was a good place to watch\nas well. I look around for a decent\nA marathon on wheels is not as easy as it sounds..\nvantage point to no avail, the\nofficial marathon press have all the\nbest spots, and with out a 'Marathon\nMedia' pass I have no chance. Oh\nwell impromptu press scrum time;\nGet out of the way you Fat\nAmerican Tourist. I struggle to a get a decent position; too late Liz\nMcColgan runs past in the lead and\nall I can see is the back of some\ngranny's head. I move to the side\nand get a decent view. 10.00am,A cheer goes up, its the lead men -1\npoint my camera, aim, and fire off\na few shots, nothing amazing and\nnot what I came here for, but its a start. I wait; 10.18, some guy runs\nup and kisses his girlfriend, it must\nbe the start of the fun runners, I catch a glimpse of Alex as he runs\npast - I give him a cheer, at least\nnow I know where about s he is\nrunning - he's on for a good time.\nI dive on to my bike and start\nheading back to Tower Bridge, no\neasy ride this time, 35,000 other\npeople all want to use the road at\nthe same time and I don't appear in\nOld, fat Eamonn Martin, the eventual winner in second place during the race.\ntheir plans, I move on to the back\nstreets, diving in and out of river\nside walks and doing more U turns\nthan a Tory Government, as I reach\ndead end after dead end. I get to\nTower Bridge just in time to see\nAlex run past - no time for a photo\ncall here, its photogenic but packed\nsolid. I move down a side road to\ncatch the later stages of the course,\n100 metres for me, 7 miles for the\ncompetitors. The women's leaders\nhad just run through and Liz was in\n3rd serves you right for being so\ncocky think I.1 move round to get a decent\nvantage point at one of the less\npopular viewing points, I am\nshooting across ab. end and I get a decent angle on the lead men as they\nrun through, I run off 5 shots in two\nseconds thanks to the motor drive\nand focus prediction on my camera.\nThat's more like it I think, now to\nget some shots of Alex. Crossing\nunder the track using a Hotel car-park, I fast talk my way past a marshall to acquire a new vantage\npoint. Now I can see any on coming\nrunners and there's not a fat\nAmerican tourist in sight. I wait,\nmore runners, I recognise some of\nthe faces who where ahead of Alex\nat the Cutty Sark. Alex is late, he\nhas slowed down by about 15\nminutes. I catch sight of him in the\ncorner of my eye as he comes into\nview; keeping him in the centre of\nthe shot all the time I fire as many\nphotos as I can.\nOnce back on my bike, I head\nalong Embankment, up to\nWestminster bridge again, the\nfinish, more waiting, more runners;\nAlex is late, very late, I assume I have missed him when the first of\nthe chicken suits passes me, I head\nhome.\nPage 11\n\n"

Most of them are to be\nfound lurking in newsagents posing\nas magazines with free CDs stuck\non them. This one is different.\nFirstly they're honest, let's face\nit, here we have aCD with a free\nmagazine. Logically it is therefore\nfound in record shops and goes for\naround ate nner. Secondly, they're a different\nshape. The magazine, all 192 pages\nof it, is CD size, with the CD lodged in the back cover. Nice for\nstoring with your other bits of\nplastic. If you're a fan of record\nsleeves/case inserts, this is the\nultimate.\nThen we have the music. Lots of\nit compares with your average CDmagazine. (This volume 17 tracks,\nalmost 80 minutes of music). Also,\nall up-to-date, otherwise\nunavoidable versions of songs of\nestablished, up and coming and\nobscure indie/new wave bands\n(Gallon Drunk, Unmen, Senseless\nThings, Bjork...).\nAltogether a well thought out,\nbargain priced package but...Well\nwhen you buy a compilation you\nmight expect to hear the tunes you\nhear in your favourite clubs, or in\nthe charts (indie or otherwise) not\nrandom album tracks. Some people\nmight view this as a drawback\nhowever, I didn't mind, after all every song is new the first time you\nhear it and these will soon be\nbuzzing around in your head as the\ntrendier one did mere days before.\nWell happy and impressed.\nFOB.\nI won't warn you again about reading these pointless\nbits of text.

Though this sounds too\nreactionary, in my heart of hearts,\nit will no doubt rank alongside\nLove's 'Forever Changes', Nick\nDrake's 'Five Leaves Left' and\nVan's 'Astral Weeks'\u2014no obvious\nsingle material, but timeless and\nclassic\u2014perfect for 4am misery.\nCD's are inappropriate and do not\ndo justice to David Gray, but vinyl\nmay capture that rawness lingering\nin the air tonight.\nRespect is due as he has\nsupported an eclectic variety of\nartists such as the Balanescu\nQuartet, Miranda Sex Garden and\nnow, dc Basehead.\nSpiritually cool vibes and funky\nmotifs with unbelievable lightness\npervade this set, lead Michael\nprancing around on stage\nexclaiming o bsc en it ites and at times\nimprovising.

    "content": "Felix 964\n'eat ure30 April 1993\nRipples in the universal pond\nJonty Beavan talks to Professor Tom Kibble about this year's Schrodinger\nLecture, which takes place on Thursday\nEvery year a thankless task is doled\nout to a senior physics academic at\nImperial College, every year\nsomeone has to persuade the\ngreatest names in Physics and\nMathematics to come and blind the\nunwashed masses of South\nKensington with the brilliant glare\nof their scientific insight. Fast\nbecoming a ritual here, the 1993\nSchrodinger Lecture will take place\nnext Thursday 6th May in the Great\nHall and will be presented by\nProfessor Micheal Berry.\nBut what of this year's master planner? Professor Tom\nKibble, ex head of the Department\nof Physics here and the forgotten\nhalf of the Higgs-Kibble Boson (An\nelementary particle that it is hoped\nwill unify all the forces of nature),\nhas that role. Before allowing him\nto unashamedly plug Micheal\nBerry's lecture in the hallowed\npages of Felix, I asked Professor\nKibble about the background to an\nevent that has become a part of life\nhere.\nThe Schrodinger lectures started\nafter a conference held at Imperial\nsix years ago to celebrate the\ncentenary of Erwin Schrodinger's birth, the gen tie man responsible for\nforcing the confusion of quantum\nmechanics upon the world. Such a success was the event, that the\norganisers had the rare difficulty of\nhaving a lot of money and not\nknowing what to do with it. It was\ndecided that a lecture should be\norganised one year later with a prestigious speaker, again the\nlecture received sponsorship and\nallowed another speech to be held\nthe following year. Thursday's lecture is no exception and is\nsponsored by Taylor and Francis\nLimited, thus insuring that we are\nnot lost for a lecture next year.\nAlthough Schrodinger's work has\nhad far reaching consequences on\nscience in this century, promoting\nthese labours was not the aim of the\ncommittee that arranged the\nlectures. Instead the principle was\nto generate interest in science by\ndirecting the discussion at an\nundergraduate audience.\nSchrodinger himself was renowned\nas a clear and charismatic speaker\nwhen covering technical subjects,\nhaving several books of his popular\nlectures published in his lifetime.\nAnd so, under the flag of\npopularising science many of the\nworld's most famous and influential\nscientists have entered Imperial\nCollege to speech with our\nundergraduates.\nSteven Hawking came in 1989 to\nput forward his opinions on\nimaginary time. Mandelbrot spent\nsome time here in 1991 talking\nabout fractals. His lecture proved\nto be so popular that the Great Hall\nin the Sherfield building could not\ncope and the event was moved to\nWestminster City Hall. Although\nmathematical sciences are always\ngoing to a guiding force behind the\nlectures, this is not always the case:\nIn 1990 Leslie Orgel chewed the fat\nabout the origins of life.\nMicheal Berry the guest of\nhonour on Thursday, is a Royal\nSociety award professor at Bristol\nUniversity. His numerous academic\nachievements include the Royal\nMedal, the Paul Dirac Medal and\nthe Julius Edgar Lilienfield prize.\nSCHROD IN GER LECTURES1988931 st1988 Dr J Georg Bednorz\n'High Temperature Superconductivity\u2014Discovery and\nDevelopment'\n2nd1989 Professor Stephen Hawking, CBE FRS\n'Imaginary Time'\n3rd1990 Dr Leslie Orgel, FRS\n'Molecular Replication and the Origins of Life'\n4th1991 Professor BB Mandelbrot\n'Chaos and the Fractal Geometry of Nature'\n5th1992 Professor FJ Dyson, FRS\n'Quantum Past\u2014The Limitations of the Quantum\nTheory'\n6th1993 Professor MV Berry, FRS\n'Some Geometric Phases'\nAlthough an eminent intellectual he\nis renowned as an orator and his\nconstantly giving lectures around\nthe country. Best known for his\nwork on what is called 'Catastrophe\nTheory' and adaption of the ideas,\nlike Chaos, which produced the\nfamous Mandelbrot set, to Optics\nand theoretical physics. When he\napplied catastrophe theory is to the\nworld of Quantum Mechanics\nwhich rules the smallest aspects of\nmatter, Micheal Berry discovered\nan effect which he named the 'Berry\nPhase' and this will be the main\npoint of the discussion on Thursday.\nProfessor Kibble describes the\nconcept as 'a very intriguing idea'\nwith far reaching uses. A simple\nway of visual ising the principle is\nfound in a common bicycle wheel.\nImagine a wheel is held horizontally\nand a mark put on any point along\nits rim. If the wheel is then moved\nthe path of the motion and the\ncorresponding movement of the\nmark on the rim of the wheel can\nbe related in what Professor Kibble\ndescribed as a very interesting\nway'. Standing alone this example\nwould be of little interest to\nPhysicists, but the methods used can\nbe applied to the intricacies of\nQuantum Mechanics, a source of\nfascination and research funding to\nall involved with science.\nEnthusiastically recommending\nthe lecture Professor Kibble warned\nthat the venue may fill up quickly.\nIndeed while we were talking he\nreceived a phone call in which the\npossibility of moving the event to\na larger site was discussed. For\nthose of you interested in going\ntickets can be obtained from Mr Vandridge Ames room 333, level\n3 of the Sherfield Building. Give or\n| take the crush of people the lecture\nwill start at 5.30 pm on Thursday\nin the Great Hall, Level 2 of the\nSherfield Building.\nPage 9\n\n"

Now before\nyou embarrass yourself and say\n'Who?' look up their name in the\nannals of rock/pop history. You\nwould do well to look under the\ncategory of Ska. The selector were\nthe Kings and Queens of the Ska hill\nin the late 70's and throughout the\n80's. Along with other ska legends\nsuch as The Specials, Madness and\nThe Beat they were responsible for\nthe entire ska movement and the\nrise of 2 Tone records. Their hits\ninclude 'On My Radio' missing\nWords 'Too Much Pressure' and\nthey play a strict ska sound that is\nas poignant today as it ever was.\nCertain to get you all to your feet\nso that you'll be dancing so much\nyou had better bring a spare pair of\nshoes as you are likely to wear one\npair out.\nThe dance music representatives\nat this epic celebration of musk is\nin the form of Ariel. Described in\nthe press as bringing together the\nrough sounds of techno and hip hop\nwith undiluted hard hitting guitar\nriffs and bliss ed out vocals into a convincing overall sound. But\nanyone who has seen them or saw\ntheir recent appearance on 'The\nWord' rec end y will know this is just\nmusic jour no bullshit for excellent\nband. They are the latest signings\nto De-construction records and their\nnew EP 'Let It Slide' is being hotly\ntouted in Clubs of all type all over\nthe country.\nBringing up the rear are seasoned\nIndi-pop band The Hearthrobs. One\nof Gary Crowleys favourites at the\nmoment they are unlike the run of\nthe mill Indi-guitar bands they are\ngood! Described in the press as\n'The Pixies with lots of 'F factor'\n(Shagability to you dumbo)' they\nare a band to keep an eye on. The\nnew single 'Worser' is causing a stir\nin the Indi-pop world and is one of\nthe best tracks of this genre so far\nthis year.\nTo top it off is the openers for this\nmammoth music masterpiece\ncalling themselves Gods Zoo. They\nare nothing to do with The Cult\nmuch more in the vein of Living\nColour or a Funk metal kind of\nband. Currendy playing the London\ncircuit these talented musicians\nproduce a remarkable blend of\nfunky almost reggae ish backline\nwith blistering guitars and vocals\noverlaid . A very good young band\non the circuit but not for long as\nMTV and the star status associated\nwith it looms ominously on the\nhorizon.\nSo hopefully you will agree this\nis a musical event for all tastes.

Contingency plans\ntook us to Alicante on the Costa\nBlanca, and from there, in 'Bullet'\nthe hire car, we sped to Calpe, Rob\nat the wheel.\nGCSE Spanish phrases ('I do not\neat school dinners because they are\nhorrible') and Jans humble Espanol\n('Seven beers please') managed to\nbook us into a campsite for one\nnight.\nPilgrims to the volcanic rock\nfaces; disciples to Cliff Craggs,\nauthor of 'Costa Blanca Climbs'\n(our bible for the next ten days). We\nfirst scaled the p end n de Ilfach by\nthe South face taking the 'Via\nValencianos' route. Five pitches\n(820ft) and 6 hours later we'd made\nit to the sum mut, five hours after\nthe tourists who'd walked 'via the\npath'. Julian, determined to win the\nmost hideous shorts competition,\ncaught malaria while he cooked\nbolognaise that evening and doubled\nhis success for the most bitten legs.\nBivvying on gravel for a second\nnight prompted us to hire cheap\naccommodation for a week, found\nwith ease at this time of year.\nAlthough the caretaker wouldn't permit prassi M ng attempts from the\nbalcony or the eyesore of the inside\nof Rob's sleeping bag draped over\nthe verandah he made no comment\non the fact that Julian wore his\naward-winning shorts in the pool\narea, overlooked by other residents.\nWe climbed extensively, at gas\nmark 5, shorter routes at Toix East\nand West over the next few days\nwhich had original names such as\n\"The Green Route' and 'Another\nGreen Route'. All the routes in the\nIhe Guide were well protected with\nx> lts placed every couple of metres\n',an essential part of a Spaniards\nrack- is a 'Black 'n' Decker rock\ndrill) and the rock gave good\nfriction. The only risk which\npresented itself was falling on one\nof Rob's' tea towel' extend ers. Sarah renewed her status as an aid\nclimber on one horrendous slab.\nOn a second multi pitch route up\nthe Pendn de Ilfach by the NW face, Martin came face to beak with\na nesting sea gul, who, finding his\nsun hat offensive, dive bombed him.\nWe climbed in the Mascarat Gorge\nthe following day, despite creating\nour own mountains of egg-fried rice\nmade interesting by the odd\nmolecule of meat, and the group\nsplit the day after, one party\nclimbing at the Dalle D 'Ola and the\nother at Sella, an hours drive away\nalong hairpin bend roads.\nOne group of three spent a day\nascending the 1200ft Puig\nCampana. Sunbaked and thirsty,\nAndy delirious after expecting a 'relaxing day' (quote Rob) to\nrecover from Extreme climbing the\nday before, we descended after ten\npitches by at rec hero us route to\narrive (thanks only to the glow from\nsome luminous yellow Ron Hills)\nat the pick-up (\u2014a bar) at 9.30pm. While some took a day off to buy\nup the rock boot factory shop in\nAlicante (and finding it shut\nresorting to the golden beaches),\nthree others braved a790ft,7 pitch\nroute ('Via UPSA') up the South\nside of the Barranco Del Mascarat.\nAgain, at rec hero us descent route:\n'Traverse the narrow ridge...' (a knife edge)'.. .follow the terrace...'\n(what terrace?) '...climb the 15ft wall (Diff) onto the open hillside...'\n(Open? NOT! Lots of s cree and\nscrub) '...Turn L and descend E into a gully...' (Smooth rock at\n45\u00b0!) '...then across the railway\nline...' (Slide under passing train)\n'.. .to eventually reach...' (drop 15ft onto...) '...the road. Do not be\ntempted to turn L too early as there\nare cliffs below.' It seems Cliff\nCraggs didn't make it.\nSella was the place to be. It\nboasted a huge range of climbs for\nall abilities, all bolted on a selection\nof crags, free camping amongst the\nalmond groves and settlements of\nlong hair Spanish climbers, and no\ndod gy descent routes. We spent the\nend of the tour here. Martin claimed\ntitles for both the hardest lead and\nthe greatest lob (although Sarah's was more dynamic) but failed\ndismally at the ongoing shorts\ncontest despite wearing two pairs at\nthe same time. Ian gained, hands\ndown, the most patient belayer\naward for staying awake (just) as\nRob remained on a microscopic\nledge for 1 'A hours (an\nunder estimation, no kidding!) as he\nwaited for the next ice age to erode\nnew holds.\nSarah Wingrove.\nOn the 27th March sixteen mad\nfools voluntarily entered a Union\ntransit van and embarked upon a two-day journey to the Isle of Skye,\nwhich included a deadly doner\nkebab in Dumbarton at the end of\nthe first day.\nThe wind picked up as we\napproached Glen Bittle campsite\nand as the gate closed behind us, the\nrain started.\nThe first day saw an absurd\nattempt to reach Waterstein Head in\nforce nine winds and cannonball\nrain which unfortunately had to be\naborted.\nOn Tuesday an intrepid party set\nout on a17 mile walk in similar\nconditions to the previous day's efforts, taking in one Munro (a peak\nover 3,000 ft or 914m in height) and\novercoming the terrors of the Bad\nStep: a dod gy traverse of a steep\nrock face with the Atlantic Ocean\nbeckoning below.\nA second party attempted Bla\nBheinn (928m) but were beaten\nback by the sli ghd y less than\nfavourable conditions.\nAfter a brief stop in Portree,\nwhere several members were seen\nto consume large quantities of\ndoughnuts, we proceeded on\nWednesday to the Old Man of\nStorr, which resulted in an\nunwarranted ly vicious snowball\nfight. It was at this point that one\nof the authors endured an\nuncomfortably high heart rate while\nascending a snow laden gully. This\ndiscomfort was offset by a remarkably favourable change in\nthe weather, with sunshine and blue\nskies.\nBy the following morning two\nsuicidal maniacs had decided to\nattempt an ascent of Sgurr a Mhadaidh (918m) and Sgur a Greadaidh (973m), finally being\nstopped by sheet ice some 20m short of the second summit.\nMeanwhile, those who had\nPage 12\nClubs & Societies\nFelix 964 30 April 1993\nCircus\nBalls, knives and people are flying\nthrough the air. Clowns delight,\ntumblers leap and all kinds of act\nbewitch and enchant the eye. The\naudience is enjoying some of the\nbest circus acts in the country,\nbrought together on the\nun prepossessing stage inside a decorated warehouse in darkest\nIslington. This is a night out with\na difference. Cabaret night is the\n'shop window' for Circus Space\nand if you feel inspired by the\ndashing young men (and women) on\nthe flying trapeze you can return\nduring the week to learn for\nyourself. In the autumn of 1989 a group of enthusiastic circus\nperformers set out to provide a site\nin London where they could\npractice and create new circus acts.\nThey found a suitable derelict\nbuilding and, undeterred by the\nj evidence of twelve years occupation\n| by pigeons, set about making it in\nto a usable space for training. They\nI approached Gillian Harwood of\nUnited Workspaces, responsible for\nthe property, and she agreed to let\nthem use the building for a few\nmonths until a tenant could be\n.found. The recession removed any\nrealistic chance of this happening\nand Circus Space began to develop.\nYears later the pigeons are a distant\nmemory. The building has been\nthoroughly renovated, including the\nW& mm\ninstallation of heating and toilets, all\nthe result of many hours of\nvolunteer labour. They pay a princely rent as formal tenants and\nenjoy the support of the London\nArts Board. The informal teaching\nhas become a well organised system\nof regular classes and occasional\nworkshops for all levels of skill.\nThe aim is still fundamentally the\nsame: the development of good\ncircus in Britain. They offer quality\nteaching, both to professional\nperformers and as a leisure activity\nfor enthusiastic amateurs. In\nparticular they are proud to be able\nto provide aerial skills training. This\nwas one of the main reasons for\nfounding the Space, as it requires\nspecialised trapeze equipment\nwhich is not available elsewhere.\nAlso they have a resource of expert\ngymnastic skill. I frequently attend\none of the popular juggling classes,\nwhere I practice along side the best\nwithout feeling out of place. It is an\nexcellent way to push myself to\nlearn new tricks, in an environment\nwhere I can get the help to master\nthem. It is also a fun way to meet\nother jugglers and enjoy an evening\nof something quite different. If you\nare interested in Circus Space,\neither to train there or to see one of\ntheir cabaret shows you can pick up\na flyer in the Union Office with\nmore details. I recommend that you\nat least go along and see what is\nhappening there if you have an\ninterest in circus arts. Note that\nthere are no animals there, Circus\nSpace is for human circus acts only.\nDunbarton\nretained some sanity walked over\nMacleod's tables: two flat-topped\npeaks on the North-West of the\nisland.\nIt should be noted that by this\npoint some 14 of the 16 members\nof the party had contracted the\ndreaded lu rgy and were suitably\nrestrained in their activities. The\nunion van was also suffering from\nseveral mechanical maladies.\nFriday dawned bright and clear,\nseveral hours after which a party\nascended Bruach na Frith (958m) before descending to the Sligachan\nHotel for liquid refreshment.\nThe remainder of the party\nascended the ridge of Sgurr nan\nGobhar and Sgurr na Banachdich\n(965m) which resulted in superb\nviews of the entire Cuillin ridge and\na 'fascinating' scramble along a snowy ridge to the neighbouring\npeak of Sgurr Dearg before a breakneck descent of the s cree slope\ndown to the camp-site.\nSaturday dawned wet and windy\nwith increasing numbers of the\nparty incapacitated with the lu rgy. One party walked down Glen\nSligachan and over a col towards\nTorrin, whilst the other party sat in\na cafe and, later, a pub (briefly)\nbefore meeting the others and\nreturning to the campsite. The\nprospect of a Tuna Mornay drove\nthe entire party to the pub in the\nevening wherein suitable quantities\nof alcohol and food were consumed\nand this article was written.\nShould you feel an affinity for\nsuch acts of insanity, please contact\nRoss Richards (Aero II) for details\nof our forthcoming summer tour.\nPaul Davison\nRichard Harpin\nAre you eligible to\nregister under the\nNHS at the Health\nCentre?\nAll eligible students and other members of Imperial\nCollege are invited and urged to register at the\nHealth Centre under the NHS, if they are not already\nregistered with another GP. Registrations at the\nCollege Health Centre bring in funds which are\ndevoted to improving services (not to staff income), which is all related to fixed scales!).

We refer of course to\nthose most outspoken devotees of\nThor, Wodin (Odin) and Loki\ncollectively known as Wodinites\nand the members of the proposed\nWodinSoc.\nLet us consider the issues raised\nin earlier letters; the question of law\nand order could well be answered\nby many more individuals dying\ngloriously in battle and going to\nValhalla, thus finding an avenue to\nchannel their aggressions, but\nwhere does that leave us in\nNorthern Ireland? It's enough of a bloodbath already without involving\na load of bloody great battle-axes.\nWodinism singularly fails to\nrecognise the economic\ncomplexities of modern Europe, or\ntake account of the needs of\ntwentieth century man. How can the\ntried and tr use ted methods of rape,\npillage and dismemberment work in\nsociety today? These ideas really\nseem more suited to another place\nand another time, and the possibility\nof a European roasted-boar\nbought season tickets yet.

As for laying\nthe spoils of war at the feet of the\nKing instead of paying taxes, well,\nall systems have good points, but\nwe just can't picture Prince Charles\nin a bear skin and horned helmet.\nThe incessant desires of the\nWodinites to seek out new lands to\nconquer, terror is e and die\ngloriously in, seems to understate\nthe concept of a coherent European\nwhole and the entire principle of\nreligious and racial tolerance is\nswept under the moose-hide rug.\nThe Wodinites claim that\nmodern-day Scandinavian countries\nsuch as Sweden and Norway cannot\nbe described according to the\nclassical model of idealistic\nWodinite states. But what about the\nstrong-arm tactics used during the\nEuropean football championships to\ncontrol football hooligans?\nThis said, we will personally\ncontribute to the air-fare back to,\nScandinavia of any Wodinite who\nis sufficiently dissatisfied with\nBritish beliefs and customs that they\nwish to leave.

I was interested to read of no\nless than eight bad fruits, produced\nby the tree of western civilisation\nas an indication that Islam is the\nright way.\nThe root of this fruit being\n'freedom and benefit' giving rise to\nselfishness. Let us look at the other\ntree for a moment. When one\nspeaks of freedom, one must be\ncareful not to associate it with Islam\nfor the two never shall meet. You\nneed only look at the deadened eyes\nof women in chador s who are\npermitted no identity, respect\u2014and\nany beauty that they do have is\ncarefully hidden.

To look at\nIslam, is to me to see a flower\nplucked, where rigid legalism has\nreplaced freedom, where 'fatwas'\nhave replaced mercy.\nThere is hope, one of the 44\nIslamic Republics have replaced the\nShah's symbol of sword-wielding\nlion with the symbol of a tulip.

Police have been ordered\nto crack down on bike crime in\nLondon from the first of May. Until\nthen, cyclists who are caught\ndisobeying the law will be warned\nand possibly officially cautioned.\nAny bike rider apprehended after\ncause an alarm to be triggered.\nAccording to security sources, 'any\nother smoking substance' will also\nset off alarms. Mr Graham Cox,\nImperial's Fire Officer, said that\nwhen a new system is installed in\nbuildings already occupied, some\n'teething problems' will occur. Mr Cox added that each detector could\nbe 'interrogated' to find the source\nof the alarm, and that a number of\nfire warnings had been activated\nthat were not caused by pipe or\ncigar smoke.\nThe Warden of Weeks Hall, Dr\nSimon Walker, said that there had\nbeen about half a dozen alerts since\nstudents returned after the Easter\nbreak. The disturbances could be\nirritating, but the system was new,\nsensitive and sophisticated and had\nbeen installed for the protection of\nresidents. Dr Walker told Felix that\nthere had been one accusation of\ncannabis use, but that those\nconcerned had denied it and he had\nno evidence to disbelieve their\nclaims.\n1st May will be forced to make a court appearance, and could face a fine.\nPC Coleman said that the purpose\nof the campaign was to increase\nawareness among cyclists that\ntraffic laws applied to them, as well\nas other road users. The drive will\nbe backed up by leaflets and posters\nemphasising the safety aspects of\nobeying traffic laws. PC Coleman\nsaid it was important that Imperial\nstudents were aware of the risks of\nflouting the rules of the road as so\nmany students ride bikes through\nWestminster.\nThe National Union of Journalists has launched a campaign to save a former Felix Editor. The Bill Goodwin Campaign Fund plans to help Mr\nGoodwin take his case to the European Commission of Human Rights.\nThe case will be heard on 7 September.\nMr Goodwin faced a possible 12 year jail sentence in a case heard in\nNovember 1989. Workingfor The Engineer, he received classified financial\ninformation about a well known company, which for legal reasons we\ncannot name. Mr Goodwin contacted a senior executive of the company,\nwho obtained an injunction banning the publication of the story. The High\nCourt ordered Mr Goodwin to reveal his source. He refused, and was\nfound guilty of contempt of court. Mr Goodwin, escaping with a \u00a35000\nfine, told Felix he had not been jailed 'because of the publicity'.

Bashmet's beautiful and\nvaried tonal palette went from rich\nlyricism in the Walton concerto\n(conductor Valery Gergiev could\nhave been more idiomatic here) to\nthe intense final statement of\nShostakovich. His awesome viola\nsonata made its full impact despite\none or two slow tempi.\nThe LSO start their summer\nseason on the5 th May with\nBruckner's Fourth Symphony under\nSir Georg Solti.\nPlinthos\n\u2022 The Barbican Hall. Box Office\n071-628 4151.\nThe Queen of Spades The construction of Tchaikovsky's last symphony is the work of a skillful dramatist, and few who\nknow the Pathetique will be\nsurprised at the masterful theatrical\npacing of the composer's setting of\nPushkin's 'The Queen of Spades',\nrevived by the ENO during April.\nTchaikovsky identified closely\nwith the central character,\nHermann, a tormented outsider who\nis torn between his love for the rich\nnoblewoman Lisa and the obsession\nGroundHog Pay The film is set in small-town USA\nwhere Phil (Bill Murray), a self-centred and arrogant reporter, finds\nhimself covering 'Ground Hog\nDay'. Anyway Phil, his producer\nRita (Andie McDowell) and the\ncameraman try to leave town the\nsame day, but are held up by a snow\nstorm (actually something\nbeginning with 'b' but I can't spell\nit), so they return to town to stay\nthe night. When Phil arises the next\nmorning, to his horror he finds\nhimself reliving Ground Hog Day.\nwith gambling which eventually\ndestroys him. David Pountney's production is psychological rather\nthan naturalistic; billowing, opaque\ndrapes suggest the mists of insanity\ninvading Hermann's mind. The set,\na raised semicircular colonnade,\nremains unchanged throughout the\nopera, which involves the relocation\nof Lisa's suicide from the banks of\nthe river to the Countess's bedroom, with some loss of\natmosphere.\nMusic Director designate Sian\nEdwards draws a beautifully\nblended sound from the orchestra,\npreferring to hint at rather than\nspotlight instrumental textures. The\nsubtle accompaniment to Peter\nSidhom's excellent singing makes\nenthralling listening of Tomsky's Act I aria. In Act II, no less\ncompelling is the old Countess as\nshe recalls her youth as the Venus\nof Moscow, toast of Parisian high\nsociety; a true pianissimo from\nPatricia Payne and the merest glint\nof muted brass in the orchestra.\nGraeme Matheson-Bruce\ncaptures the complexity of\nHermann, but is a little\nunderpowered. Janice Cairns is an\naccurate, strong-voiced Lisa.\nPatrick Wood.\n\u2022 Last performance tonight at the\nColiseum, St Martin's Lane, at\n7.15pm. Tickets from \u00a36 on the\ndoor.\nNEXT WEEK: Preview of the\nENO '93/'94 season.\nReviewers\nWanted\nIn truth Phil must relive Ground\nHog Day until he gets the day just\nright.\nThis is an enjoyable film which\nis in essence about how Bill Murray\nmust pull Andie McDowell in order\nto end a particularly nasty day (by\nvirtue of the fact that he must relive\nit so often). In order to do so, Phil\nmust turn himself into Rita's ideal\nman (charming, intelligent, caring,\nplays a musical instrument, humble\nand other stuff). Though the\nreformation of Phil is a bit annoying\n(and predictable), Phil's abuse of\nhis own particular brand of\ni mortality makes up for this.\nOn the whole it's worth seeing.\nIsmail.\nBoof^ Rogue Warrior\nby Richard Marcin ko This autobiography is like no other\nthat I have ever read; it seems like\nan adventure thriller of the military,\nbut is in actual life written by an\nAmerican ex-Navy Captain. This\nman was responsible for the\nconception, establishment and\ntraining of one of the world's top\nC RW( Counter Revelutionary\nWarfare) teams, SEAL Team Six.\nThe book starts by reciting a mishap\nat 19000 feet, when his parachute\nfails to open during a HAHO (High\nAltitude High Opening) deployment\non exercise. It improves.\nThe book continues to recite his\nlife from early on in his life when\nhe drops out from college (which he\ncalls Voluntary Disenrolement),\nthrough his joining the navy and his\ntraining through various special\nwarfare sections and his climb\nthrough the ranks. It transfers all the\nexcitement of the situation at hand,\nbe it in Vietnam in the '70s to\ntesting the security at top Military\nestablishments throughout America\nand abroad.\nThis man is a true maverick; a brilliant leader and warrior in the\nfield of u north a do x Special Warfare\ntechniques. He is arrogant,\negocentric, obnoxious, violent,\nbrilliant. To some he is the ultimate\nexample of a bad officer - he drinks\nwith his men, he swears at\nAdmirals, he shits on senior\nofficers, but to others he is the\nperfect warrior. He somewhat\nextreme training methods are\nfrowned upon by the paper pushing\n\"Dip Dunk\" staff officers but he\ngets results which the much higher\nup C NO( Commander of Navy\nOperations) appreciates.\nI found the book truly compelling\nand if it were not for me already\nbeing in the military, it would make\nme feel like volunteering\nimmediately. A brilliant author. If\nthis book is well publicised I can\nforesee it becoming a best seller.\nExcellent. 10/10.

Working\nthrough out ex-Yugoslavia, Balkan\nvision TV has achieved new heights\nof horror, original depths of\ndespair, a tech nicol our panorama of\nthe worst in the human condition.\nParents, make sure your children\nare locked up in bed when this\nraunchy shocker howls across\nLogie Baird's brain child, because\nwe are not sure if they could cope\nwith this X rated production.\nAs B VTV enters every home of\nthe civilised world, Mr and Mrs\nNuclear Family react. He grits his\nteeth and resolves that if he were\nthere it would all be different; 'we\nwould show them what for', he\nmutters. She sheds tears of silent\nhorror at the mutilation, thanking\nGod that it is not her children that\nare caught in the killing fields. And\nin the village and the town, a cry\nrises up, 'we do not want this to\nhappen', they shout, 'do\nsomething', they echo; the people\nare speaking.\nIn the halls of power, deep\nsouthern indecision is rife, grey\ncompromise does not answer the\nquestions. They know that a people\nthat held the Nazis at bay for four\nyears can not be easily persuaded\nto go home and sup cocoa with their\nrivals. They know that each action\nhas a reaction, and the body bags\nwill soon fill with election-losing\nBritish soldiers instead of unknown\npeasants from a foreign land.\nThere is no conspiracy, just plain\nuncertainty, no right and plenty of\nwrongs. The great Satan and Moral\nGuardian of the planet can see no\nachievable objective; there will be\nFelix 964\nno action, just delay. But all the\ntime the West is being dragged in\ndeeper and deeper, more troops,\nmore aid, more sanctions. Until the\nfateful time that our soldiers are\nkilled or maimed, then with a backlash of wounded pride, we will\njoin the war that few want and\nfewer understand.\nSometimes the most cynical\nalternative seems to be the best:\nDon't let anybody in or out of the\nformer Yugoslavia, block off the\nborders, and leave them to it. When\nthe embattled parties come to a natural peace or there is no one left\nto fight, resume the usual\ndiplomatic ties and relations. But\nwho could stand by and let humans\nbarbecue each other? Does anyone\npossess the calculating inhumanity\nto do this? Who will look across the\nblackened battle ground, as the\nsmoke clears, see the piles of\nethnically cleansed bodies and say\nOpinion\n30 April 1993\nit was all for the best?\nThere is no answer, all I can say\nis, as a pretender to the media that\nwill bring every bloodstain and\nbroken limb in your living room, I am glad I don't have to decide.\nCredits\nNews: Andrew Tseng, News\nEditor, Declan Curry, SteffT .\nFeature: Mike Chamberlain, Alex\nTavener, Phil Henry.

Clues to the\ncreator of this cruel gossip would\nbe greatly appreciated.\nIn Felix 963, I did predict, with\nodds of 5/2, that an outsider to the\nIslam affair would write, and indeed\nthey have. Mr/ Mrs/ Miss/ Ms whatever your name is, and friend,\nfailed to recognise this and insisted\non adding the prefix 'so-called' to\nmy name. Why, I don't know.\nLack of space in bygone Felices,\nall be it my fault, prevented from\nclearing up the misunderstanding\nabout my views on Dep Reps. They\ndo a bloody good job, and I never\nsaid otherwise. What I said or\nmeant to say was that I thought the\nlevel of responsibility was small in\ncomparison to that of IC President.\nHence the line '...major\nresponsibility NOT..' was used in\nCat's Eyes in Felix 959. My opinion could be wrong, however,\nand any cretin could quite easily get\nelected, Dep Rep or not a Dep Rep,\nand do the job with little ease.\nApologies to anyone who was\noffended by the Malcolm X article\nsome time last term.

The 'Make London\nSafe' plan, as highlighted in most\npapers earlier this week, is\nimpractical, costly and not the best\nsolution to an ever increasing\nproblem.\nUnion Stewards Someone sent me a rather odd\nriddle or joke or whatever you want\nto call it; it goes something like this:\n'Q \u2014 Why do Union Stewards were\ntheir radios in their back pockets ?\nA \u2014 So they have both hands free\nfor talking.' Hmmm.\nSpace Filler\nStar Trek\nWe're Famous Felix is famous (sort of). We got a mention in the diary column of the\nGuardian earlier this week, because\nwe have an interview with\nProfessor Somebody, who lets lose\na few clues as to what a Haggis\nboson is.

    "content": "'eat ure30 April 1993 Felix 964\nLSD - Tripping the tests of time\nTwo weeks ago Hyde Park was the scene of a strange, colourful and\nflamboyant anniversary. Phillip Henry describes the scene and Jonty\nBeavan fills us in on the history of the chemical background to the party\nOn the 18th of April, at speakers'\ncorner in Hyde Park, there was a celebration of the 50th anniversary\nof LSD. Approximately a thousand\npeople attended along with a considerable number of police.\nThe event that they were\ncelebrating took place on 16th April\n1943. A young and brilliant!\ngraduate of the University of\nZurich, complained of dizziness and\nleft work at the Sandoz laboratories\nin Switzerland early. Upon\nreturning home experienced what\nhe later recorded in his diary as,\n' An uninterrupted stream of\nfantastic pictures, extraordinary\nshapes with intense kaleidoscopic|\nplay of colours'.\nUnable to pin down what had\ncaused this unusual experience, he j came to the conclusion that it must I have been contact with a substance\nthat he had been working on. The\nchemical was a derivative of wheat\ner got he had discovered five years1 earlier in 1938. The scientist, Dr\nAlbert Hoffman, had named the\ncompound LSD-25.\nAmazed by the intensity of the\neffects and that the rigorous\nlaboratory conditions meant only a tiny amount could possibly have\nbeen ingested, Dr Hoffman\nresolved to investigate further. On\nApril 19th1943 he took 0.25\nmilligrams of LSD-25 dissolved in\na glass of water as a self\nexperiment.\nAfter being overcome with\nextreme confusion Dr Hoffman\nreturned home by bicycle\naccompanied by his laboratory\nassistant. During this journey the\nnow well recorded symptoms ofi\nLSD became obvious. Overcome\nby fear and a belief that he had lost\nhis mind Albert Hoffman spent the\nremaining time under the influence\nof the drug believing that a demon\nhad invaded his body and his\nneighbour was a 'malevolent,\ninsidious witch, with a coloured ]\nmask'. By the time a doctor had\narrived, Dr Hoffman had returned\nto relative coherence, but remained\nanxious that he could have poisoned\nhimself. As dilated pupils were the\nonly evidence of ill health that the\nDoctor could find, Hoffman was\nsent to bed to recover.\nApart from condemnation of\nirresponsible research techniques,\nWhy are banners like this one banned? The bearers of this one aren't sure.\nHoffman's colleagues were amazed\nat such minute amounts having such\nenormous results. Research on the\nmysterious substance continued and\nattempts were made to apply the\npeculiar effects for medical use.\nTreatment of mentally ill patients\nwith what was described as a' py s cho active drug' appeared to\nhave a positive effect. Terminally\nill cancer patients who could no\nlonger respond to pain relieving\ndrugs were completely relieved of\nsuffering after ingesting LSD.\nAt the same time as this research\nwas continuing, another side of\nLSD was coming to the fore. The\nlate 1950s and early 1960s saw LSD\nbecoming the plaything of a generation interested only in\nchallenging the existing order. Art,\nbooks and most famously of all, the\nhippy movement were inspired and\nmotivated by the drug.\nUncontrolled experimentation on\nthe scale that took place during the\n1960s was to have consequences,\nMental Hospitals were filled with\nwards of 'Acid Casualties' who had\noverindulged on the chemical. It\nwas not long before LSD became\na controlled substance.\nHyde Park two weeks ago\nbecame the centre of activity for the\nremnants and rejects from the 'Love\nGeneration'. The rumour that Dr\nHoffman would appear and speak\nto the crowd proved false but the\nproceedings went fairly quietly.\nBesides the usual bunch of\neccentrics who accumulate\nregularly around this area such as\nevangelists, black militants and\ngeneral loudmouths, there was, on\nthis particular occasion, a soap box\nfor advocates of the legal is ation of\nthe drug. However, the large\nmajority simply came to associate\nwith people of a similar disposition\njust for a chat and a good time.\nRather than being a large mass of\nbodies the crowd were separated\ninto smaller groups which\ncongregated around epicentre s of\nactivity. These were dealers, groups\nindulging in tribal dancing to home-made, extemporaneous beat or\nsmiling hippies who, judging by the\nvarious smells that were wafting\nacross the park, were openly\nsmoking pot. The whole\natmosphere was party-like, friendly\nand open, with a surfeit of shiny,\nhappy people.\nWhen the inevitable arrest did\ntake place the situation changed to\none of anger and a concentration of\npolice formed around the accused\nto stop the gathering crowd of\nseveral hundred rescuing him.\nRather surprisingly no violence\nerupted but, instead, there were a few irate words exchanged. When\nthe police presence dissipated the\ncelebratory atmosphere returned.\nA rumour circulated that there\nwould be a rave after the carnival\nbut despite questioning random\nindividuals, nobody seemed to\nknow exactly where it was. One\nperson was eager in pointing out\nthat it was not an illegal rave\nbecause there would be no dancing\n- officially. This is a convenient\nlegal loophole that would have\nallowed the event to take place\nwithout any police interference.\nSale of the substance was discreet\neven if the users were not; one\nparticular speaker was loudly\nextolling the virtues of the drug and\ninforming us of his more unusual\nrevelations which included all\nt rippers partying on the planet\nVenus thus explaining why\nscientists have yet to penetrate the\natmosphere with radar. The\nlistening police looked on with\nbemused expressions and exhibited\na fairly relaxed attitude to the\nharmless ramblings of this strange\nman. Despite this, the speaker\nwarned that at dusk he would have\nto run home since the 'Thought\nSquad Division' were after him...\nThe crowds started to disappear\nfrom half past five onwards and\neverybody seemed to have enjoyed\nthemselves, but in San Francisco\nthe atmosphere was reportedly far\nmore intense with larger numbers\nof people attending and activities\nplanned to take the crowd late into\nthe night.\n\n"
