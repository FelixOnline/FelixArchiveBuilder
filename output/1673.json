    "content": "ISSUE 1673\nFELIX\n33\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDystopian sci-fi is absolutely necessary\nComment Editor Charles Titmuss argues that dystopian futures are vital, even in our modern age, as they allow us\nto prepare for a possibly-terrible future.\nTELEVISION\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Editor\nI\nn an article published\nlast week, the current\nTV Editor proposed\nthat the dystopian\nfutures shown in contemporary sci-fi are no longer\nnecessary, for a wide range\nof reasons. I disagree: the\npurpose of this article is\nto highlight instead the\nvalue of these forms of\nentertainment, especially\nin the present day.\nSci-fi as a genre is successful when it anticipates\nthe social impact of technological developments\non humanity. The article\nlast week made the point\nthat currently, TV shows\nsuch as Black Mirror\nare too close to reality to\nbe valuable in that role.\nOn the contrary, the fact\nthat these programmes\ncan predict the potential\nhorrors of the near future\nso accurately perfectly\ndescribes their necessity.\nIf a piece of media allows\nfor the discussion about\na future technology or its\nuse, then that is an incredibly valuable function.\nThe author also seems\nto propose that reality\nis already much worse\nthan posited within Black\nMirror, or any dystopian\nsci-fi, particularly with\nrespect to misinformation,\nor to quote someone\nfamous: \u201cFake News\u201d.\nI would disagree again\nwith the specific points\nthe article makes, in that I\nbelieve economic inequality and lack of opportunity,\ncoupled with an effective\nelection strategy that\nactually targeted young\npeople as opposed to neglecting them, contributed\nto the large rise in political\nengagement.\nFake news has always\nbeen a problem, ever\nsince the ability to identify\nwith and spread ideas was\ninvented. The problem\nis not with technology, it\nis with people\u2019s need to\nself-validate their ideas,\na point which the article\nmakes. Social media does\ngive increased access to\nother communities that\nshare similar views, but\nwhen I was researching\nthe impact of social\nmedia and the internet\non terrorism in the UK, I\ncame across information\nthat suggested that it was\nthe physical social group\nthat truly drove their\nwarped views forward. I\nam not saying that this can\nnecessarily be applied to\nother ideological groups,\nbut certainly I think that\nby attributing these issues\nsolely to social media, we\nmiss a significant portion\nof the problem.\nThe article goes on to\nreference classic dysto-pias, such as the Matrix\nthat individualism is an\nirrelevant philosophy.\nChoices mean nothing\nin the face of a powerful\nstate, caste, or organisation using technology\nto engineer the perfect\nsocietal succession. This\nis best represented in 1984\nor Brave New World, one\nexploring the impact of\nterror and surveillance to\nkeep people in order, the\nother relying on genetically engineered castes and\nthe happiness drug soma.\nThese two novels\nunderline the narrative\nand philosophical value\nof dystopian sci-fi. It\nallows the author to place\ncharacters in a context\ncompletely alien to us and\nexamine their reactions. It\nforces us to compare our\ncurrent values with those\nof another hypothetical\nsocial order, that is not\ninterested in the good of\nthe individual. That is the\ntrue horror of dystopian\nsci-fi: it forces us to come\nto terms with the answers\nto awful questions, such as\n1984\u2019s what is love when\ncompared to pain, or Brave\nNew World\u2019s unsettling\nvision of a society where\nhappiness is universal,\nbut freedom is extinct. In\nthe end we must love Big\nBrother, or swallow our\nsoma tablet.\nI think the article\u2019s point\nabout optimism when it\ncomes to technology is\nwell founded: it is important not to be too pessimistic about technology, as\nsome of the advances have\nthe potential to improve\nour lives. I, however, am a\npessimist and believe that\nas much as something has\nthe potential to improve,\nit also has the potential to\ndestroy. Whenever technology advances a large\namount, an economic revolution occurs, changing\nthe established order. This\nin turn renders some jobs\nextinct. This occurred\nduring the industrial revolution with the extinction\nof the European cottage\nindustry, and is occurring\nnow with the increased\nautomation of the work-place. The net result is\ngreater wealth for those\nthat own the machines\nand the methods of their\nmanufacture, and destitution and poverty for those\nwhose livelihoods are\ndestroyed. A question that\nno one currently has an\nanswer to is how exactly\nsociety and capitalism\nwill function when 80%,\n90%, or even 95% of\nindividuals don\u2019t have a\njob due to AI? Is democracy a feasible system of\ngovernment in the face of\nan elite that possesses all\nof the wealth as opposed\nto merely most of it? Is\nthere a point in maintaining a large population of\nessentially useless mouths\nfor those that possess this\nvast wealth?\nTo conclude, there\nare big questions to be\nanswered about our future,\nthe role that technology\nwill play, and how our\nsociety will adapt to it. If\nwe believe that the values\nwe currently hold dear\nare important to pass on\nto future generations,\ndystopias must be a part\nof the current media\nenvironment so that we\ncan properly anticipate the\nchallenges that the future\nwill bring. Dystopias do\nnot provide answers to\nthese questions, but they\nmake us realise no matter\nhow bad things are, they\ncan always get worse.\nWe must fight to keep the\nworld the way we want it\nto be.\n1984 can be found\nat your local library or\ndownloaded illegally from\nbigbrotherstotallylegiti-matebooks.com\n\u201cAs much as\ntechnology has\nthe potential\nto improve, it\nalso has the\npotential to\ndestroy\u201d\nor, my personal favourite,\n1984. Exploring the differences between these two\ndystopias results in the\nconsideration that there\nare two kinds of dystopia:\nthe first type are mostly\nself-satisfying stories,\nwith examples including\nThe Hunger Games, or the\nfilm Elysium. They give\ninto the illusion an individual\u2019s choices are important\nin the face of a seemingly\nall-powerful state or AI\nthat inexplicably has a\nfundamental weakness. A\ntrue dystopia, for me at\nleast, is the absolute horror\nof the Western World:\nYeah I know this is a book, not a TV show // Wikimedia\nCan\u2019t believe Orwell wrote a book about that Apple commercial // Wikimedia\n\n"

More importantly, can we afford\nnot to?\nTECH\nXiuchen Xu\nTech Writer\nG\nene drive technology allows\nhumans to introduce genetical\nmodifications to species\nthat are always passed on\nto the next generation,\nwhich allows a characteristic to become prevalent\nin a species over very few\ngenerations. The technology is powerful enough to\nwipe out whole species,\nand has applications in\neliminating invasive\nspecies, and controlling\nvector-borne diseases. The\ntechnology is showing\npromise, and it has attracted huge investments.\nBill Gates, for example,\nhas invested a total of $75\nmillion in Target Malaria,\na consortium led by\nImperial College aiming\nto control the spread of\nmalaria. Gene drives are\nto be used for this purpose,\nspecifically one to make\nfemale mosquitoes sterile\nto eliminate the mosquito\npopulation.\nGene drives have been\nmade possible by the\ndevelopment of CRISPR/\nCas9, a powerful and\nprecise genetic engineering tool. So how does a\ngene drive work? A gene\ndrive contains a guide\nRNA which directs it to\nthe right place along the\nchromosome, then Cas9\ncuts the gene and the cell\nrepairs the damage by\ncopying the gene drive\ninto the cut site. This\nmeans the gene drive is\npresent in both copies of\na gene (both will have\nthe gene drive allele).\nwith the gene drive in\nboth copies of the gene.\nA desired characteristic\ncan be encoded within the\ngene drive to be passed on.\nGene drives can help\nsolve a range of problems.\nAs discussed earlier, they\ncould stop a range of\ndiseases such as malaria,\ndengue, and Lyme by\naltering insects. In the case\nof mosquitoes, the possible\nalterations include making\nmosquitoes resistant to the\nmalaria parasite, making\nmosquitoes sterile, and\nmaking them less interested in humans as prey.\nGene drives could also\nhelp eliminate invasive\nspecies (such as carps,\nwhose adaptability allows\nthem to wreak havoc in\necosystems all around\nthe world). Whole populations can be eliminated\nif the gene drive encodes\nfor gender (for example\nmaking all offspring\nmale). Gene drives could\nalso be used in weeds\nto reverse resistance to\npesticides, which can help\nincrease crop yields.\nIndeed, gene drives\ncould save lives and\nimprove ecosystems, but\nshould this powerful piece\nof technology really be\ndeployed? Gene drives\nhave already been successfully created within\nlaboratories, but their\neffect if released into the\nwild is yet unknown.\nThe effect of releasing\ngene drives into ecosystems is not yet known,\nbut they would likely\nseriously affect population\ndynamics. There is also\nthe fear of an accidental\nrelease, which is why\nmost labs take precau-tions. The risk is always\nthere, however, and the\nfallout could be disas-trous. Furthermore, there\nis the existence of gene\nflow, which means that\nspecies may breed with\nneighbouring species. If\ngene flow happens then\nthe gene drive may not\nbe confined to only one\nspecies, the spread to\nother species will lead to\nunwanted consequences,\nand a more complicated\nsituation. For the case of\ninvasive species, the gene\ndrive may spread away\nfrom the intended area,\nmeaning that the whole\nspecies may be wiped out,\ninstead of just the areas\nwhere they are invasive\nand don\u2019t belong. Lastly,\nthere is the fear of the use\nof gene drives for bioter-rorism, as gene drive technology isn\u2019t hard to use\n(although it takes a long\ntime to identify specific\ngenes and how to alter it to\nacquire the wanted char-acteristic). For example,\nterrorists could possibly\nadd a toxin-making gene\nto mosquitoes, which\nwould cause devastating\ndamage on a large scale.\nOverall, there is a large\namount of uncertainty\nGene drives are a powerful tool that could wipe out entire species if not used correctly // SynBioWatch\nGene drive technology could rid humanity of malaria // Wikimedia\nover what would happen if\na gene drive were released\ninto an environment. Gene\ndrives have the potential\nto save millions of lives,\nbut it could also have devastating consequences, so\nis it unethical to use gene\ndrives, or is it unethical to\nnot use them?\nThe use of gene drives\nis a complex subject,\nand the regulation of\nthis technology requires\ndiscussions on an international scale. In 2016 there\nwas a United Nations\nbiodiversity meeting\ndiscussing a gene drive\nmoratorium which was\nultimately rejected. Gene\ndrives can change the\nworld on an international\nscale, so in the future it\nis inevitable there will be\ndisagreements on the use\nof different gene drives.\nIn the meantime, scientists\nare continuing their work\nin this field, currently an\nobstacle that has emerged\nand needs to be overcome\nis the evolution of gene\ndrive-resistant organisms.\nA lot of exciting research\nis happening, much of it in\nfact taking place over here\nat Imperial.\n\u201cGene drives\ncould help\nstop a range of\ndiseases, such\nas malaria or\nLyme\u2019s\u201d\nAs a result, the gene is\ncertain to be passed on to\nthe offspring. The gene\ndrive will then repeat the\nsame mechanism when\npassed down, resulting\nin homozygous offspring\n$999 and Pixel Pen will\nretail for $99.

Everyone\neagerly awaited the an-nouncement, particularly\nthe unveiling of the company\u2019s second flagship\nsmartphone, the Pixel 2.\nHowever, in true Google\nfashion, there were a few\nsurprises in the announcement too. As always, Felix\nTech gives you a round-up\nof what went down in\nSan Francisco. From the\noutset, Google made it\nclear the focus was on\nArtificial Intelligence and\nMachine Learning \u2013 the\nidea of integrating clever\nsoftware with great\nhardware.\nGoogle Home Mini\nGoogle started off\nproceedings with the announcement of the Google\nHome range. Amongst\nthe newcomers was the\nGoogle Home Mini. You\nguessed it, a mini version\nof its original bigger\nbrother the Google Home.\nPowered by an even\nsmarter version of Google\nAssistant, the Google\nHome Mini is designed\nto either blend in or stand\nout depending on your\npreference. The design is\nbased on a small pebble,\nmade from a fabric top\nand a plastic bottom, and\ncomes in three colours;\ncoral, charcoal and chalk.\nThe device is designed to\nslot neatly in any space, no\nmatter how big or small.\nThe magic appears in the\nform of four LED lights\nunder the fabric \u2013 they\nlight up to show the device\nis listening or thinking. As\nwith all things Google Assistant, the Google Home\nMini can be controlled\nby tapping or with your\nvoice.\nMuch like its big\nbrother, the Google Home\nMini can do a huge range\nof things, from answering\nrandom questions like\n\u201cHow many teeth do\npuppies have?\u201d, giving\nyou updates on weather,\ntraffic and sports results\nto personalised schedules,\nreminders and news. The\ndevice also works with\nChromecast \u2013 allowing\nyou to stream shows\ndirectly to your TV or\nmusic to your favourite\nspeakers. The Google\nHome Mini comes in at\nan attractive price point of\n\u00a349, making it accessible\nto many more people!\nGoogle Home Max\nGoogle Home Max is\nGoogle\u2019s first foray into\nthe big speaker market.\nThe speaker is the biggest\nin their current range and\nincludes built-in machine\nlearning and Google\nAssistant functionality.\nGoogle boasts the Max has\na 20 times more powerful\nsound than the original\nGoogle Home. The use\nof machine learning has\nallowed the development\nof Smart Sound \u2013 the\nspeaker adjusts its sound\noutput automatically to the\nsurroundings it is placed\nin using machine learning.\nThis can include different\nphysical environments\nall the way to different\ncontexts. For example,\nthe speaker will play more\nquietly in the mornings\n(for those who aren\u2019t\nmorning people) but play\nmore loudly when there\nis a lot of background\nnoise (like the dishwasher\nrunning). The design is\na simple one, with two\ncolours; chalk or charcoal\nand comes with a helpful\nmagnetised foot stand\n\u2013 allowing for either horizontal or vertical use. At\nthe moment, Google Home\nMax will only be available\nin the US in December for\n$399, but more countries\nare expected to be reached\nin 2018.\nGoogle PixelBook\nThe next step in\nGoogle\u2019s Chromebook\nseries \u2013 a high performance version. The\ndesign looks very similar\nto Lenovo\u2019s Yoga line, at\n10mm thick and 1kg in\nweight, with multiple form\nfactors including a laptop\nand a tablet. The PixelBook boasts Core i5 or i7\nprocessors, up to 16GB\nof RAM and a QuadHD\nLCD display. Of course,\nit has Google Assistant\nbuilt in (with a dedicated\nbutton) and an additional\naccessory for tablet use \u2013\nthe PixelBook Pen. Prices\nfor the PixelBook start at\nof course tap to access\nGoogle Assistant when\npaired to your phone. The\nidea is that you can keep\nyour phone in your pocket\nas the headphones can\nplay music, send texts,\ngive walking directions\nfrom Google Maps, alert\nto new notifications and\nread messages.

Nearly.\nOn Tuesday evening we\nwere all gearing up to do\na 48\u2019er, which seemed like\na good idea for all of 30\nminutes. Then I realised\nthat we still only had one\ncomputer, and that, to paraphrase Meatloaf, while\nI\u2019d do anything for student\njournalism, I won\u2019t pull\nan all-nighter \u2013 we\u2019ll save\nthat for another time.\nThis week Felix has\ngone survey-mad, doing\nsome analysis on both the\nStaff Survey \u2013 which was\nsent out to all staff working\nat Imperial \u2013 and the Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES),\nwhich went out to research\npostgrads. Both were\nlargely similar, asking\npeople about what they\nthought of the College and\ntheir colleagues, whether\nthey had everything they\nneeded to do a good job,\nwhether they were happy\n\u2013 the usual.\nBut they both threw up\nsome interesting results:\nthe staff survey showed a\nhuge range in results, with\nsome staff clearly very\ncontent about how things\nare going, and others\nfurious about what\u2019s going\non on-campus. There\nmainly seemed to be a\ndisconnect between the\nFaculty/College leaders,\nand the general staff,\nwhich I think can come as\na surprise to quite a few\npeople. I think when a\nlot of students at Imperial\ngrumble about how their\ncooked breakfasts have\nbeen taken away, or that\nthe College is being run\nas a business (no judge-ment, I love to complain),\nthey\u2019re picturing Imperial\nas a vast monolithic\nentity, combining all staff\ntogether into one big mass.\nBut the survey shows\nthat for a lot of staff,\nour concerns are their\nconcerns too. A lot of\nthem feel powerless to\nenact change; many feel\nisolated within their own\ndepartment, and yearn for\ncollaboration; and I don\u2019t\nthink anyone on campus\nreally understand what\n\u2018Imperial Expectations\u2019\nare. Sometimes it turns out\nyou\u2019re on the same side\nafter all.\nMoving on to the\nPRES, I think that what\nthis can show is the issue\nof relying too heavily on\ndata. Based on the raw\nnumbers, it looks like\nImperial are doing really\nwell \u2013 and I\u2019m sure they\nare! Pat yourselves on the\nback! \u2013 but speaking to\nmy postgraduate friends\npaints a decidedly different picture. .\nLooking at the data\nalone doesn\u2019t show us\nthe people behind the\nnumbers. It can\u2019t tell you\nabout the friends I have\nwho felt forced to carry\non their research when\ntheir funding ran out, who\nbounced around from\nplace to place, sleeping\non couches and in hostels,\ntrying desperately to\nbalance the demands of\ntheir PhD with the mental\npressure of being essentially homeless. You can\nonly get that by speaking\nto people.\nSimone Weil wrote that\n\u201cthe love of our neighbor\nin all its fullness simply\nmeans being able to say,\n\u2018What are you going\nthrough?\u2019\u201d Now, I\u2019m no\nSimone Weil, but I want\nFelix to have the same\nviewpoint (although\nmaybe without the early\ndeath): we\u2019re here for you,\nto represent your voice and\nyour views, to challenge\nCollege and the Union on\nyour behalf. But for this\nto happen, you\u2019ll have to\nlet us know about it. Until\nthen, I\u2019ll be here, chained\nto the West Basement\u2019s\none working computer.\nImperial improves in PRES results, but continuing\nproblems with PhD funding are highlighted\nNEWS\nThe Postgraduate\nResearch Experience\nSurvey results were\nbetter than 2015\u2019s,\nbut reflect issues\nwith supervision and\nfunding.\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nI\nmperial College\nUnion responded\nto the Postgraduate\nResearch Experience Survey (PRES)\nthis week. The results\nindicate an improvement\non 2015\u2019s results, but\nissues with supervision\nand funding continue.\nImperial reported an\nincrease in average scores\nacross all question sectors\nsince the last PRES, with\nseven of ten sectors being\nabove or equal to the national average. However,\nsome sectors highlighted\nissues research postgraduates face: supervision,\nin particular, scored the\nfurthest below the UK\naverage, with 83% of\nImperial students satisfied,\ncompared to 86% nation-ally. The Dyson School\nof Design Engineering,\nCentre for Environmental\nPolicy (CEP), and the\nImperial College Business\nSchool (ICBS) all scored\nsignificantly below the\nImperial average for su-pervision, which includes\nskills and knowledge of\nsupervisors, as well as the\namount of contact students\nhave with them.\nImperial College\nUnion identified this as a\nparticular issue, noting:\n\u201cMany students report that\nthey do not have regular\nmeetings with their super-visor. Furthermore, some\nsupervisors do not respond\nto emails.\u201d\nOne student Felix spoke\nto, who is in their final\nyear of a PhD, said: \u201cMy\nsupervisor is really bad\nAnother student\nFelix spoke to, who has\njust finished their PhD,\nconfirmed that financial\npressures caused a large\npsychological burden:\n\u201cWhile Imperial is having\na push away from three-year funding, funding\nwas still a huge issue for\nme.

There\nis very little dialogue and\nno music during any of the\nscenes creating a deeply\neerie and unnerving at-mosphere. Middle-Eastern\nfilm is relatively uncharted\nwaters for most people in\nthe West, and thus this fascinating critique of Iranian\nsociety was undoubtedly\none of most memorable\nand thought-provoking\nfilms from the series.\n\u201cThe sparse\ndialogue and\nlack of music\ncreate an\nunnerving\natmosphere in\nRetouch\u201d\nher husband die, she saw\nthe opportunity to escape\nthe domineering marriage\nand resolutely took it and\nthen went to her job as\nusual (which consisted\nof altering the images of\nWestern female celebrities\nin magazines so that their\nshoulders do not show).\nfollows a mid-twenties\nprofessional couple\nwho are at point in their\nrelationship of no bound-aries.

The girlfriend\u2019s\ncharacter is centred around\nthe concept of gender-role\nreversal in modern\nrelationships (see the\nabysmal Amy Schumer\u2019s\nTrainwreck if you need\nan explanation), where a\nwoman adopts traditionally male attributes. Generally, this role-reversal is\nassociated with a feminist\nmessage and promotes the\nimportance of strength and\nindependence in women;\nhowever the female\ncharacter in Slap Happy is\nportrayed as homophobic,\nobnoxious, and physically\nviolent. The male actor\nhad a very pale baby\nface which was boringly\nunresponsive throughout.\nOne scene involves the\ngirlfriend describing some\nvery obscene fantasies\nto her lover during sex,\nbut all this created was\nthe feeling that the writer\ntried to throw in as many\n\u2018shock-factor\u2019 lines as\npossible.

The child\u2019s acting is\nbrilliant throughout; her\ndeeply descriptive expressions profoundly illustrate\nhow emotionally taxing\nparental conflict can be.\nThe film was, however, a\nlittle bit too short and ends\nrather abruptly leaving\nthe viewer wanting a bit\nmore development of both\ncharacters and story.\nand Heath Ledger\u2019s affair\nin Brokeback Mountain.\nThey eventually share a\n\u201cComing to\nterms with\nyour sexuality\nin modern-day India, a\ncountry where\nhomosexuality\nis still illegal,\nis illustrated in\nGoddess\u201d\nkiss at a family wedding,\nwhich Tara\u2019s mother finds\nout about.

This\nfilm focuses on a typical\nloyalist family in the heart\nof Glasgow and begins\nwith the father (an Orangeman) preparing for a\nstandard day of marching\nby putting on his sash,\nsinging \u201cGod-Save the\nQueen\u201d, and talking about\nimmigrants in a derogatory way. On the surface he\nis the archetypical strong\nProtestant Glaswegian\nman; however his fetish\ninvolves dressing up like a\nbaby whilst his wife feeds\nhim milk from a bottle and\ncradles him in her arms,\nillustrating his profound\nvulnerabilities and obscure\nsexual comforts.

But with\nthe movement of its\npeople comes the movement of a culture, of a\nheritage, of a language, of\nwords \u2013 words that were\nso beautifully showcased\nin Sea Migrations at the\nRoyal Festival Hall, which\nfeatured poetry readings\nby four contemporary\nBritish-Somali women\npoets.\nA collaboration\nbetween the London Literature Festival and Somali\nWeek Festival, the event\nsaw readings of poetry and\nshort stories that tackled\nissues of identity, of the\nnature of home, loyalty,\nlove, and family. Despite\ntheir different backgrounds and mediums,\nseveral themes recurred\nthroughout the evening:\nwhere is home and what\nmakes a home? How does\none reconcile loyalties to\ndifferent lands, the culture\nthat one is born in and the\nculture that one is nurtured\nin? How does one embrace\nfamily when one has to\ntraverse language and\nculture to reach it? And\nhow does one hold on to\none\u2019s heritage, when every\nday is a step further away\nfrom home?\nThe event takes its\nname from another of\nAsha\u2019s poems, The\nSea-Migrations, which\nlaments the enormous\noutflow of Somalis from\ntheir motherland and\nthe underdevelopment\nof a great land with a\ngreat culture. \u201cIf people\nabandon their homes and\ndecamp by boat,\u201d she asks,\n\u201cwho\u2019ll stay behind in our\ncountry?\u201d Indeed, all four\nwriters of the evening\nwrote of home and\nidentity, of the difficulty of\nstraddling loyalty to two\nlands, and the dilemma\nof having been forced to\nleave due to violence yet\nfeeling a responsibility\nto and identity of their\nhomeland.\nHanna Ali, the second\nwriter to take the stage,\nand a PhD student at\nSOAS, describes her experience as a child refugee\nin her short story The Story\nof Us, sparing no detail\nwhen explaining how her\nmother watched her uncle\ndie. In another story, she\ndescribes how the bloated\nbellies \u201creminds us that\none can be empty and full\nat the same time\u201d. These\nconflicting states, the\nemptiness and fullness,\nthe desire for stability\nand the attachment to\none\u2019s homeland, seems\nto recur in the writing of\nthe diaspora. Despite the\nviolence she describes,\nHanna writes that her\ncountry \u201crefused to let\nher forget that she fled,\nescaping all the problems\u201d,\nwords that ring with an\nalmost accusatory tone.\nIt is difficult to reconcile two vastly different\nidentities, a balancing act\nthat manifests itself in\nmore than just conflicting\nloyalties. Having grown\nup in the UK, Hanna\ndecided to study English\nin college, a decision that\nher mother could not com-prehend. Hanna writes\nthat her parents\u2019 love was\nlike \u201cthe silence between\nwhispers\u201d, acknowledging\nthe quiet love behind\nher mother\u2019s cold, stoic\nexterior. \u201cNobody taught\nher to be soft\u201d, she writes.\nHer upbringing in a\ndifferent environment\nfrom her mother inevitably drew an even larger\ngulf between her mother\nand herself. Here, the sea\nimagery of the event title\nbears even more signif-icance. When thinking\nabout home, Hanna\ndescribes the \u201cwomen at\nthe bottom of the sea\u201d,\nreferring not only to the\nlives lost on migratory\njourneys, but also, I think,\nbits of one\u2019s culture and\nheritage that are left\nbehind, lost to the swells\nas one adopts a new land.\nIf there was one thing\nthat would give away\none\u2019s heritage, it would be\nlanguage, the most visible\nmarker of one\u2019s identity.\nWhile Asha writes in\nSomali and read her poems\nin Somali with the English\ntranslations read by Clare\nPollard, all the other three\nwomen wrote and read in\nEnglish. Hanna\u2019s short\nstories have been translated into Somali by a third\nparty, and she laments in\none of her poems that she\n\u201cspeaks to Somalia in a\nbroken tongue\u201d. Another\npoet of the evening, Farah\nGabdon, wrote that \u201cthere\nis more English in me than\nI can stand\u201d.\nIndeed, language is\nthe most obvious, even\nif sometimes unrepre-sentative, manifestation\nof one\u2019s identity. The\nperceived loss of their\nmother tongue is seen as\na marker for the gradual\nerosion of their ties with\ntheir homeland.\nOn that account,\nperhaps one way to bring\ntwo cultures together,\nthen, is the integration\nof languages. Farah and\nHanna wrote about their\nexperiences of war in\nEnglish, bringing Somali\nexperiences to a wider\naudience. Interestingly,\nAsha writes many of her\npoems in the gabay form,\na traditional Somali oral\ntradition that alliterates\nwith a certain letter each\ntime. Yet she also deals\nwith contemporary issues,\nmaking traditional forms\nrelevant to the modern\nworld. Her poems make\nuse of pastoral imagery,\ndescribing the beauty of\nSomali land, and referring\nto images of camels,\nflowers, trees and birds.\nPerhaps this is an attempt\nto recreate her home in\na foreign country in the\nform of words, and to\nshare it with others.\nIt was fascinating to\nhear the English translations of Asha\u2019s poetry\nread before the original, as\nthat meant that I was able\nto better appreciate the\nmusicality of the Somali\nwith some idea of what\nit was about. The words\nrolled off Asha\u2019s tongue\nlike the waves of the sea.\nThere is magic in hearing\npoetry in a foreign tongue:\nit is like a song \u2013 musical\nnotes without comprehensible lyrics but still rich in\nemotion.\nWith the increased\nmovement of people,\nwhether forced or volun-tary, it becomes ever more\nimportant to create bridges\nbetween the native and\nthe immigrant, between\nmotherland and adopted\nhomeland, between\ncultural identities. Events\nsuch as this hold an\neven greater significance\nagainst the current sociopolitical backdrop of\nBrexit and xenophobia.\nThe writers have shown us\nthat nationality and race\nare constructs, false lines\nthat are easily knocked\nover and impossible to fit\nwithin. Their words transcend boundaries, gener-ations, conflict, and even\nlanguage itself, forming\nthe bridge between identi-ties, peoples, and cultures.\nAsha Lul Mohamud Yusuf and Clare Pollard at the Southbank Centre // Kate Stanworth\n\n"

Huerco S. has fused\nGas\u2019 idiosyncrasies with\nmore conventional techno\nto create warm looping\ntextures with glitchy clicks\nand soft hisses. He has a\nunique talent for making\nmusic that, despite not\nbeing designed for clubs,\ncaptures a distanced,\nglazed view of the club\nfeeling. Like most 90s\nambient, it is music for\nthe chill-out room, for the\ncomedown.\nFollowing a brief\ninterval, Voigt appeared\non stage. Like a delicate\nrustling of leaves, he\nslowly unveiled his synths\nand rumbles; these grew\nwith the introduction of\nhypnotic melodies which\ngradually became more\nchaotic and harder to\nfollow, all the while a\nfairy-light forest projecting behind him. The noise\ncontinued to develop until\nit swallowed the room.\nSuddenly, the thud of a\nheartbeat leapt into the\nundergrowth. This basic\nmodel is at the core of\nall of Gas\u2019 music, and\nAfter about an hour the\njourney was over. Voigt\nleft the stage immediately\ndespite what appeared to\nbe a stagehand advising\nhim to stand in the spotlight for applause. He may\nnow be playing internationally regarded concert\nhalls, but he is still the\nking of Cologne underground at heart. Shunning\nindividual recognition,\nhiding behind a variety of\nmonikers, and producing\notherworldly music. This\nis ambient music at its\nbest. A sonic cathedral,\nwithin which you can\u2019t\nhelp but worship.\nSt. John Sessions: Laurel Halo and Lee Gamble\nH\nyperdub is odd.\nIt\u2019s always been\nodd. But it has\nknitted itself so\ntightly into the fabric of\nLondon\u2019s musical culture\nthat when two of its artists\nplay experimental sets in\nan 18th century church, it\nsomehow feels perfectly\nnatural.\nI arrived at the St. John\nChurch in Hackney to\nfind a substantial crowd\nalready present, framed in\nmoonlight emanating from\na majestic stained glass\nwindow. It was the perfect\nsetting for Laurel Halo\u2019s\ntranscendental blend of\npop, techno, and jazz. Halo\nappeared on stage with\npercussionist and sound\nartist Eli Keszler in tow,\nplacing herself behind an\nelectronics-lathered table\nwhile Keszler took to a\nsmall drum kit.\nThe set consisted\nmostly of songs from her\nsuperb 2017 release Dust\n\u2013 although the album cuts\nhad been bent almost un-recognisably out of shape.\nHalo sculpted electronic\nlandscapes with punchy\nprogrammed drums,\nbottomless bass-lines and\nsublime synths. Keszler\nprovided an erratic yet\nconscientious jazz percus-sion, utilising thin sticks\nand brushes to produce\ngentle textures, clashing\nwith Halo\u2019s overwhelming\nnoisy flourishes in all the\nright ways. On album cuts\n\u2018From Sun to Solar\u2019 and\n\u2018Jelly\u2019, voice manipulation software transformed\nHalo\u2019s poetic speak-sing-ing into shimmering\nundulations around the\ncavernous room.\nDescribing Halo\u2019s\ncurrent output is not so\nstraightforward. Although\nthe blissed-out reverb\nand dub techno basslines\nfrom previous releases are\nundoubtedly present, categorising what was played\nacross the hour-long set is\nnigh on impossible. Laurel\nHalo has proved herself to\nbe a truly unique talent in\nelectronic music; she is\nher own genre.\nThe stark contrast\nbetween Halo\u2019s near-per-fect performance and the\nfollowing set from Lee\nGamble was mildly upset-ting. The London-based\nproducer\u2019s Diversions\nThat\u2019s What I Call UK\nBass\u201d. Gamble\u2019s dark,\nCaribbean-inspired cuts,\nfor which he\u2019s loved, were\nrefreshing in a time where\ndancehall and Reggaeton\nhad been saturated with\nmusicians with both eyes\non that \u2018One Dance\u2019 cash.\nHowever, the ambient and\nDnB pieces he spewed\n(between puffs of his vape)\non this evening were less\nimpressive, and seemed to\nmisjudge the venue\u2019s vibe.\nThe consistent quality\nof Hyperdub releases\nis a result of the label\u2019s\nboldness to explore\nunknown quarters of\nelectronic music, without\nregard for the existence\nof an obvious audience.\nThough they may not\nhit the mark on every\noccasion, if they continue\nto put on events as audacious as this, their impressive reputation will only\ncontinue to thrive.\nMUSIC\nJosh Lawrence\nMusic Writer\nMUSIC\nJosh Lawrence\nMusic Writer\nNarkopop was Gas\u2019first new album in 17 years // Kompakt\n\u201cThe sculpted\nwood of the\nconcert hall\nreverberates\nwith thick,\nearthy noise\u201d\nof synths, Voigt aimed to\n\u201cbring the German forest\nto the disco\u201d.

The\ninfluence of Latin and\nWest African rhythms is\napparent through most\nof her songs, leading to\nthe not-quite-normal 4/4\nfeel, and melody lines\npicking up seemingly\nfrom out of the blue. A\nfocus on intricate vocal\nmelodies derives from her\nlove for Saharan music,\nwith singers like Oumou\nSangare inspiring her\nvocalisations. It\u2019s amazing\nhow natural it comes to\nher as well; her guitar\nplaying \u2013 which can get a\nlittle messy \u2013 rhythmically\nflows naturally against\nthe constantly-changing\ndirections of her songs,\nmatching her powerful\nand fluid voice.\nIn this album, the guitar\nis used less as the focus of\nharmony, more providing\nsmall cross-rhythms and\nshort melodic riffs behind\nthe close, thick vocal parts.\nThe guitar playing is very\nbass heavy, giving context\nto her harmonies and\nsimple rhythms to mess\naround on top of. These\nharmonies, which are the\nmost impressive aspect\nof the album, are done\nquite tastefully; to get a\nvenerable sound alongside her more personal\nlyrics on a song such as\n\u2018Homebody\u2019, she\u2019ll leave\nher voice exposed for the\nwhole line - just as she\u2019s\nabout to ease out of it, the\nother vocal lines creep in,\nas if to reassure herself.\nOther times she\u2019ll build up\nthe harmonies enough that\nher lead part only slightly\nrides above, dipping in and\nout of the many layers in\nan almost overwhelming\nflood of voices, as heard\nat the end of \u2018Crossfire/So\ninto you\u2019.\nMy only issue with\nthis album is that Hiatus\nKaiyote\u2019s Choose your\nWeapon, from which most\nof the covers come, is a lot\nmore complete and holds\nmany more interesting\ndetails musically than this\none. And to be fair, the\nwhole album could appear\na bit self-conceited; it\npretty much replicates\nher existing work, but\nnow with three fewer\npeople. However, Needle\nPaw is more for herself\nand her fans, giving us\nan introspective take on\nher already established\ncompositions. I can\nimagine that this is how\nshe hears her songs in her\nhead, millions of beautiful\nvoices piled on top of each\nother, constantly changing\ntheir direction. And even\nin a stripped back form,\nthe songs hold power\nunder her unaccompanied,\nmasterful control.\nSo overall I\u2019m happy\nwith what she\u2019s come out\nwith, and can\u2019t wait for\nNai Palm to drop even\nmore fire.\nM\nura Masa\u2019s\ns e l f - t i t l e d\ndebut album\nis a refreshing display of what our\ngeneration has to offer.\nThe Guernsey-born DJ\nstarted making tunes from\nhis bedroom and came\nonto the radar when he\nreleased his song \u2018Lotus\nEater\u2019 on Soundcloud in\n2014. Although he has\nonly just turned 21 he has\nsince collaborated with the\nlikes of Stormzy, A$AP\nRocky, Charli XCX, and\nthe lead singer of the\nGorillaz, Damon Albarn,\njust to name a few.\nThe album starts out\nwith a sample taken from\na tube stop announcement\nand then jumps to the\nfirst song \u2018Messy Love.\u2019\nThroughout the album,\nyou\u2019re met with several\ndifferent styles and genres,\nso it is difficult to categorise his music. Mura Masa\ndoes not shy away from\nusing unconventional\ninstruments like the steel\ndrum, harp, or flute, which\nmakes the music pretty\ncool. Instead of adhering to\na single genre, Mura Masa\nuses a blend of genres to\ncreate a distinct electronic\nsound, setting him apart\nfrom the competition; he\nis one of the first artists\nfrom our generation, and\nhe doesn\u2019t adhere to old\nconventions. Fellow audiophiles will agree that we\naren\u2019t limited to our record\ncollections anymore but\ncan listen to anything we\nwant, and I believe this is\nmanifested in his style.\nI also want to touch on\nthe fact that Mura Masa\nhas some sick album art.\nI respect a man with a\ngood Instagram, and Mura\nMasa\u2019s is peng.\n\u20181 Night\u2019 describes\nCharli XCX\u2019s one night\nstand with a boy, with\nwhom she doesn\u2019t want\nto have a relationship.\nAsking if their relationship\ncould go back to where it\nwas before they had sex,\nshe sings \u201cIt was only one\nnight / But I wanna go\nback to where we were\u201d.\nIn contrast to \u2018What if I\ngo?\u2019, where Bonzai sings\nquite literally the opposite.\nMura Masa\u2019s collaboration with famous rapper\nA$AP Rocky, \u2018Love$ick\u2019,\nis the most popular song\non the album. A$AP\u2019s\naccompanying rap creates\na balanced match for\nLove$ick\u2019s Caribbean-influenced style, together\nwith Mura Masa\u2019s signature bass drops, which will\nhave your hips shaking in\nno time.\nOverall, the album is a\ntribute to what it means\nto be young these days.\nA glaring shout to pursue\nhappiness through sex,\nfriendship, and just not\ncaring too much about\nthings.

    "content": "FRIDAY, 27TH\nOCTOBER, 2017 FELIX\nTRAVEL\n34\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTime to get your hops up: Felix\u2019s guide to Hop-on Hopoff bus tours\nWhen family or friends come to visit, fitting sightseeing into our busy schedules might be challenging. Bus tours to\nthe rescue!\nTRAVEL\nElina Michaelidou\nTravel Writer\nWhat is a Hop-on\nHop-off bus tour?\nA Hop-on Hop-off bus\ntour is a city sightseeing\ntour, usually on a dou-ble-decker bus with the\nupper level left open. The\ntour involves a free audio\nguide in different languag-es, with the number and\nvariety of the languages\ndepending on the city that\nthe tour bus operates in. In\nlarge cities, the buses are\nfrequent during the high\nseason and may have more\nthan one route. What\u2019s\nspecial about them is that\nyou can hop on and off at\nvarious stops whenever\nyou want throughout your\nticket validity. 24h tickets\nare the most common,\nwith 48h tickets also available in some cities.\nWhen should I take a\nHop-on Hop-off bus\ntour?\nSuch tours are incredibly useful when you have\na limited amount of time\nto spend in a place you\u2019re\nvisiting. The tour usually\nlasts for one hour, but\nI\u2019ve recently been on one\nthat lasted for two hours,\nso you should check the\ntime with the bus driver\nor other people working\nfor the company. You can\nfind tour operating times\nand ticket prices on the\ncompany\u2019s website or spot\nthem in advertisements\nacross the city you\u2019re\nvisiting.\nThese tours are also\na promising choice if\nyou want to visit many\ndifferent attractions that\nare far apart. There are\ncases when the public\ntransport is not reliable or\nwhere you simply want to\nlearn something whilst on\nthe go, which you can do\nby listening to the audio\nguide on the tour bus.\nWhat are the advantages and disadvan-tages?\nAdvantages of Hop-on\nHop-off bus tours include\nvisiting the major sights of\na city in a short amount of\ntime, while also hearing a\nfew historical facts about\nthem; connecting with the\nmajor city attractions; and\nhaving the choice of many\ndifferent audio guide lan-guages.\nHowever, there are a\nfew disadvantages. Firstly,\nweather conditions, such\nas bright sunlight, rain,\nand strong winds, can\nspoil your tour, especially\nwhen the bus is moving.\nMost buses don\u2019t have a\nroof on the top floor, so\nwhen it\u2019s hot make sure to\nbring a hat and wear lots of\nsun cream; and when it\u2019s\nrainy, make sure to bring\na waterproof jacket. I personally don\u2019t recommend\nsitting on the lower level\nas the view can be limited.\nSecondly, the bus tours\nare generally not suitable\nfor taking good photos.\nFinally, such tours can be\nexpensive. However, some\nof them include discounts\nfor other attractions when\nyou show your bus ticket\nat the door or apply for a\nprovided discount voucher\nonline, so check this in\nadvance. Ed: In London,\nday tickets cost around\n\u00a330 per person, though\nthey usually also include\na Thames cruise, walking\ntours, and whatnot.\nWhen to book?\nTickets can be bought\nanytime from the bus\ndriver. However, advance\nbooking is recommended,\nespecially during the high\nseason and for popular\ndestinations. Online\nbookings may also offer\na discount. But for some\ncities/companies, online\nbooking may not be avail-able, so buying tickets\nfrom the driver may be the\nonly option.\nHow do I take better\nphotos?\nAs mentioned earlier,\nbus tours aren\u2019t good\nfor taking photos. When\nyou\u2019re trying to take a\nphoto, the bus will be\nmoving, and when it stops,\ninevitably either a car or a\ntree will be blocking the\nview. So here are some\ntips:\nFirstly, put your camera\ninto standby mode, so\nyou can act quickly when\nneeded. Secondly, aim to\ntake photos when the bus\nisn\u2019t moving, e.g. at traffic\nlights, before making a\nturn, or at stops. Most\nbuses stop at popular\ntourist attractions or even\nviewing points, though\nthis is subject to the city\nand their regulations.\nTake advantage of all\nthose stops and take a few\nphotos if there\u2019s anything\nspecial out there.\nMoreover, choose your\nseat wisely. On a full bus,\nthis may not be an option,\nbut if you take the bus\nfrom its starting point,\nyou may have a few more\nchoices. For instance,\nsitting in the front row\ngives you a full view of\nwhat\u2019s ahead. The only\ndisadvantages are that the\nfront window usually isn\u2019t\nclean, and you can also\nsee your reflection when\ntaking photos.\nFinally, keep your\ncamera still, like on\nthe edge of the bus.\nWARNING: Only do this\nif your camera has a strap\nthat you can wrap around\nyour wrist/neck/shoulder,\nand remember to hold it\ntightly!\nEd: For more travel\nstories and tips, visit\nElina\u2019s blog at https://\nempnefsysandtravel.com/.\nThe upper deck usually offers the best views, especially if you\u2019re lucky to get a\u2018window\u2019\nseat // Pixabay\nAn example of a\u2018good\u2019photo taken on a Hop-on Hop-off bus in Bournemouth // Elina\nMichaelidou\n\n"

The\nbrutal dictator\nGeneral Fyles is\nno more! His evil\nreign has finally come to\nan end, after a prolonged\ninternal struggle, led by\nthe brave Colonel Alan\nPerfect and ably supported by Major Charles\nTitmuss. We have retaken\nthe Comment section and\nrestored it to Freedom,\nLiberty, and Truth! The\nmanagement wish to\nreassure those that live\nunder the new duumvirate\nthat business will continue\nas usual provided their\nLoyalty remains unques-tioned. Traitors to the\nCause, and those that write\nbetter Comment articles\nneglected child of Felix,\nthe Comment section is\nset in the unloved middle\nof the newspaper, only\noccasionally seeing the\nlight of day as people\ndesperately search for the\ncentrefold. Despite this\nignominious situation, the\nComment section remains\na crucial and vibrant part\nof the newspaper, rather\nlike some forms of non-le-thal bacteria. It is the most\ncritical part of a student\nnewspaper, as it creates a\nspace for measured debate\nand the careful expression\nof opinion by students and\nstaffaboutarangeoftopics\nthat they are interested in,\nengaging with the rest of\nImperial on sometimes\nhighly sensitive subjects.\nA good example from\nlast year was the article\nwritten on Tie Clubs in\nFelix issue 1661 that\nprovoked significant\ndebate all over the univer-sity. We are both looking\nforward (at least I am) to\ncreating and editing more\narticles that split opinion\nto the same degree. This\nleads perfectly into the\nnext excellent thing\nabout the Felix Comment\nsection: people read the\narticles that you create,\nand will be interested in\nyour perspective. You can\nhave an impact on the way\nthat your peers \u2013 some\nof whom will no doubt\nbecome very successful\nindividuals \u2013 view an\nissue that you care about,\nand raise awareness of\nthat issue, all as a result\nof the research that you\nhave done and the article\nyou have created. It is\nnot necessary to possess\nany particular skill as a\nwordsmith, or I would\ndefinitely not be writing!\nIf you have an idea for an\narticle, simply come down\nto the Felix basement and\ntalk it over with either one\nof us. Don\u2019t worry about\nthe fact it\u2019s in a basement:\nthink Steve Jobs and not\n50 Shades of Grey.\nI have been warned\nabout the sensitive\nhandling required for\ncertain subjects, but I am\nnearly always on side of\nfreedom of expression. If\na view is controversial it\nis not productive to sweep\nsaid view under the carpet.\nIt is far more useful if that\nview is expressed in an articulate fashion, so that it\ncan then be considered and\nunderstood in context, and\nA\nll hail Major\nCharlie Titmuss\nand Colonel\nAlan Perfect,\nthe new supreme leaders\nof the Comment section!\nFred Fyles has been finally\noverthrown! I would like\nto thank my mum, my\nfriends, the FA, and especially Muammar Gaddafi,\nwho was a great source\nof inspiration in this coup\nd\u2019\u00e9tat.\nThis year we want\nthe Comment section to\nbecome the most high-pro-file part of Felix. We know\nit has been sometimes\nneglected, but we can\nrestore it to the place it\ndeserves: as an outlet for\nany Imperial student to\nvoice their opinions on\nissues they care about.\nWe are well aware that\nyour opinions as a student\nmatter, and we will use all\nour strengths to make sure\nthey are properly heard.\nA format we want to\nemphasise this year in\nthe section is the \u201chead\nto head\u201d page, which will\nlook exactly as this article\nlooks next to Charlie\u2019s on\nthe left. You might be one\nof those people that loves\nan internet discussion,\nand is able to craft some\nbeautifully long, properly\nsourced arguments on\na reply to an obscure\nFacebook thread. This\nformat is then definitely\nfor you. Get the person you\ndisagree with to write an\narticle, write one yourself,\nand we will display it as a\nhead to head debate here\nin Felix for all students to\nsee. You will be amazed\nby the response you get.\nFelix is ultimately about\nraising the issues you care\nabout. You don\u2019t have to\nbe Union President for\nyour voice to be heard. We\nhave had some amazing\ncomment pieces come to\nus during these past years,\nfrom articles steering\nimportant debates about\nmental health to passionate discussions about how\nterrible ales are if you\u2019re\nEuropean. If anything\nbothers you about the university experience, why\nquit at just raising it with\nyour Year Rep? Here, at\nthe Comment section, we\nwill make sure your initi-atives, frustrations, ideas,\nand rants can be properly\nheard. Hell, we will even\nhelp you out to make sure\nyou word them right.\nBe the change you want\nto be. Have a positive\nimpact.

The\ntwo combined to startling\neffect to create Daniel\nPlainview in There Will\nbe Blood, as Day-Lewis\nredefined acting. Ten years\non, and the three-time\nAcademy Award winner\nreturns to the silver screen\nafter five year hiatus;\nyet over the summer we\nlearned that this would not\nbe a lengthy re-emergence.\nDay-Lewis had said after\nhis last film that he would\nbe taking a break, and it\nDay-Lewis was a ferocious and committed actor,\ncapable of completely\ntransforming himself and\nbecoming an entirely different man, or sometimes\nanimal, all together. The\nstories about just how\nintense his methods were,\nand how intimidating that\ncould be for other actors,\nare well documented. He\nhas held the title of the\nbest actor in the world ever\nsince he burst onto the\nscene to win the Academy\nAward for My Left Foot in\n1989, and confirmed this\ntitle with stunning performances in an eclectic mix\nof films, from The Last\nof the Mohicans to In the\nName of the Father, The\nAge of Innocence to The\nBoxer, Gangs of New York\nto Lincoln.\nIn the time since he last\nworked, he has continued\nto be considered the best,\nas it was thought he would\nreturn. So he will, but just\nfor one final hurrah. In that\ntime, a number of others\nhave emerged to try and\nsteal the crown. If they\nhave careers half as good\nas Day-Lewis that will\nbe a great achievement.\nWhile it is tempting to\nlinger and pay tribute to\nthe great performances of\nnow may be considered\nthe greatest actor in the\nworld. The King is dead,\nlong live the King.\nNote: This is essentially\na list of the best actors of\nthe present day. Screen\nlegends such as Al Pacino\nand Robert De Niro will\nnot as such be considered for this list in spite\nof continuing to work.\nHonourable mentions:\nMichael Fassbender,\nBenicio Del Toro, Javier\nBardem, Mads Mikkelsen,\nJean-Louis Trintignant,\nGael Garcia Bernal, Viggo\nMortensen, Denzel Washington, Kang Ho Song,\nTom Hardy, Ryan Gosling,\nOscar Isaac, Ed Norton,\nColin Farrell, Steve Carell,\nMatthew McConaughey,\nSean Penn, Michael\nShannon, Issey Ogata,\nRalph Fiennes, Mark\nRuffalo, Josh Brolin, Mark\nRuffalo, Ethan Hawke.\n3) Christian Bale\nBest Performances:\nAmerican Psycho, The\nFighter, American Hustle, The Machinist, The\nBig Short\nThough Christian Bale\nwas born in Wales, he\nconsiders himself English.\nLooking at his filmog-raphy, he may as well\nconsider himself whatever\nnationality he wants to\nbe. First coming to public\n\u201cDaniel DayLewis and\nPaul Thomas\nAnderson\ncombined to\nstartling effect\nin There Will Be\nBlood\u201d\nappears that he has only\nreturned to join forces\nwith the man who brought\nout his career-high role,\nand that this will be the\nvery last time we see him\nin a film.\n\u201cIf any of the\nactors working\ntoday have\ncareers half as\ngood as DayLewis, that\nwill be a great\nachievement\u201d\nsuch a phenomenal artist,\nlet us look forward to the\nfuture, and consider who\nattention at the age of 13\nas the lead in Spielberg\u2019s\nEmpire of the Sun, in a\ntremendously demanding\nrole of one so young, Bale\nlater garnered acclaim\nfor what is now a cult\nperformance in American\nPsycho. From then on\nBale has managed to mix\ncommercial recognition\nwith critical acclaim,\nplaying Batman in the\nDark Knight trilogy and\nstarring in Terminator\nSalvation, whilst still\nmanaging to work with interesting filmmakers such\nas Terrence Malick, Jane\nCampion, Zhang Yimou,\nDavid O. Russell, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott,\nTodd Haynes, Hayao\nMiyazaki, Werner Herzog,\nand Michael Mann, as well\nas garnering an Academy\nAward win from three\nnominations. Bale is as\nrenowned for the intensity\nhe applies to his preparation for a film as the acting\non camera itself, famously\n2) Tony Leung ChiuWai\nBest Performances:\nIn the Mood for Love,\nChungking Express,\nHappy Together, Infernal Affairs\nHailing from Hong\nKong, Tony Leung is one\nof the greatest actors in\nAsian film history. Often\nreferred to in the media\nas the Orient\u2019s answer\nto Clark Gable, Leung is\nevery bit as handsome and\ncharismatic, but the key is\nthat he is a far better actor\nthan Gable ever was. He\nhas roots in television, and\nmade the step up to film\nwith Hou Hsiao-Hsien\u2019s\nA City of Sadness, which\nwon the Golden Lion at\nVenice. He gained international recognition for this\nfilm, and has remarkably\ngone on to star in two\nadditional Golden Lion\nwinners.\nPerhaps Hong Kong\u2019s\ntwo greatest cinematic\nsons are Wong Kar Wai\nand John Woo; the former\nknown for his delicate,\nlyrical romantic dramas,\nand the latter successful\nworldwide for his raucous\nbrand of eye-popping\naction. The fact that Tony\nLeung is the favourite lead\nfor both of these men is a\ntestament to his versatility.\nEven as Wong himself\nlosing 30kg to become\nskeletal in The Machinist\nand The Fighter, while\ngaining the same amount\nof mass for his muscular\nportrayal of Bruce Wayne\nand his podgy lead in\nAmerican Hustle.Amaster\nof accents and genres,\nperhaps the only role he\nhas yet to completely\nconvincingly master is the\nromantic lead.\ndecided to step into the\nmartial arts film realm,\nso well-trodden before,\nwith The Grandmaster, he\nrelied on two things: his\nunique eye for beautiful\nimagery and Tony Leung.\nAble to say as much in a\nglance as a gunshot, Leung\nis a truly wonderful actor\nappreciated everywhere\nby lovers of cinema.\nSpotted performing in\nthe street with his brother\nand sisters, Joaquin\nPhoenix appeared on\ntelevision as a child before\ncoming to prominence\nwith a small but memorable role in Ron Howard\u2019s\n1989 comedy Parenthood,\nat the age of 14. It would\nbe another six years\nbefore Phoenix returned\nto the big screen, during\noverdose. This experience\ncertainly seems to have\nshaped him, providing\nhim with a brooding\ndarkness and trouble in\nhis eyes. Where others\npretend, he is the real\ndeal \u2013 his bark has a bite.\nHe stormed back into the\npublic eye with a haunting\nturn as a problematic high\nschool student in Gus\nvan Sant\u2019s To Die For,\ngoing on to work with\nthe likes of Oliver Stone,\nJames Gray, and Philip\nKaufman, before earning\nhis first Academy Award\nnomination for Sir Ridley\nScott\u2019s Best Picture-winning Gladiator. This made\nhim and the late River\nPhoenix the first and so\nfar only brothers ever to\nbe nominated for Oscars\nin acting, as well as\nbecoming the first Puerto\nRican (he was born in San\nJuan then raised in the\nUS), alongside Benicio\nDel Toro in the same\nyear, to be nominated for\nan Academy Award. He\nwould go on to turn in\nintriguing performances\nunder the tutelage of interesting filmmakers such as\nThomas Vinterberg, James\nMangold, Terry George,\nand M. Night Shyamalan,\nwith a particular highlight\nbeing his incredible imper-sonation, both acting and\nsinging, of Johnny Cash\nin a performance that saw\nhim lift the Golden Globe\nand come oh-so-close to\nthe Oscar.\nEver the eccentric,\nPhoenix then announced\nhis retirement from acting\nto pursue a career in rap\nmusic, which spawned\nperhaps the most notorious late night show\nappearance of all time on\nDavid Letterman. This\nturned out to be a hoax, as\nPhoenix grew out a huge\nbeard and acted like an\nasshole, all in the name\nof performance art. Or he\njust grew out a huge beard\nand acted like an asshole,\ndepending on how you see\nit. He returned with one\nof the most devastating-ly-committed performances of the century in Paul\nThomas Anderson\u2019s The\nMaster, which saw him\nin pole position to win the\nOscar until he slated the\nwhole notion of awards\nseason in an interview.\nSince his comeback he has\nonly gone from strength\nto strength, working again\nwith Anderson, Gray,\nand van Sant, as well as\nthe likes of Spike Jonze,\nWoody Allen, Lynne\nRamsay, Jacques Audiard,\nand Garth Davis, embarking on a run comparable\nto that experience by the\nlikes of Jack Nicholson,\nAl Pacino, or Robert\n1) Joaquin Phoenix\nBest Performances: The Master, Her, Inherent Vice, Walk the Line, You\nWere Never Really Here, Gladiator\nDe Niro in the \u201870s. A\nromantic loner who falls\nin love with his operating\nsystem in a near future\nLA; a devious pimp exploiting an innocent Polish\nimmigrant in 1920s New\nYork; a stoner PI sucked\ninto a hazy mystery in\nthe 1960s hippie era; and\na troubled army veteran\nturned gun-for-hire on\na mission to rescue a\nyoung girl from a child\nprostitution ring \u2013 these\nare just some of the meaty\nroles he has transformed\nfor with such astonishing\nconsistency. This man is a\nchameleon capable of nigh\non anything. Romantic\nlead, stoner, alcoholic,\nsinger, dancer, professor,\nEmperor of Rome; he can\ndo it all. The diversity of\nPhoenix\u2019s filmography\nis remarkable. The only\nthing that is the invariable\nthroughout is the undying\ncommitment and fierce\nintensity with which he\nmanipulates himself to\nbecome these characters.\nHail to the chief // Granada/Miramax\nCoach is looking a bit gaunt // Paramount\nSmouldering Tony Leung // Universal\n\u201cWhere others\npretend,\nJoaquin\nPhoenix is the\nreal deal \u2013 his\nbark has bite\u201d\nwhich time he witnessed\nthe tragic passing of older\nbrother River on the street\noutside Johnny Depp\u2019s\nViper Room nightclub,\nfollowing a speedball\n\n"

These changes mark\na shift in Czech voting\ntendencies, mirroring\nthose found all across\nEurope.\nThe landslide victory of\nANO, a centrist-populist\nparty led by Czechia\u2019s\nsecond richest manAndrej\nBabi\u0161, was predicted\nby all polling agencies.\nHowever, prognoses about\nthe remaining parties\ncompletely failed, grossly\nunderestimating the\nappeal of the Pirate Party\nand the anti-immigration,\nanti-Islamic, Eurosceptic\n\u201cFreedom and Direct\nDemocracy\u201d (SPD) which\nfinished third and fourth\nrespectively. They also\nfailed to predict the poor\nresults of the left-wing\n\u010cSSD and Communist\nparty (KS\u010cM) who each\ngot a meager 7% \u2013 their\npoorest result yet. The\nreason for these inaccura-cies? Although the authors\nof the polls claim we need\nto take standard error into\naccount, the main factor\nwas most likely the indecisiveness of many voters.\nThis uncertainty reflects\ndistrust and displeasure\nwith the traditional\nparties, and so many of the\nwavering voters laid their\nhopes in the new, anti-es-tablishment parties such as\nPirates and SPD.\nAlthough ANO established itself as the winner\nin all regions, a closer\nlook reveals nuances:\nthe party gained most of\ntheir new votes where\n\u010cSSD suffered the largest\nlosses \u2013 thus it seems\nthat ANO pulled its votes\nfrom Social Democrats,\nalthough the two parties\nhave led the government\ntogether for the past four\nyears. The country has\nprospered under their\ngovernance, maintaining\na surplus budget for two\nconsecutive years and\ndecreasing the unemployment rate to the lowest\nin the EU. One can argue\nthat both parties have\na share in this success:\nhowever, ANO took the\ncredit. Why is that the\ncase? The persona of the\nANO\u2019s Andrej Babi\u0161 plays\na major role, being cited as\nthe second most influential\nfactor in the election of the\nparty.\nBut who is Babi\u0161? The\nSlovak-born agricultural\nand media tycoon entered\nin the Communist party.\nHowever, much like\nDonald Trump and Silvio\nBerlusconi to whom he is\nlikened, the voters don\u2019t\nseem to mind his wealth.\nThey also gladly turn a\nblind eye to many accusations against him \u2013 such\nas the \u2018Stork Nest Case\u2019\nin which Babi\u0161 received\nEU subsidies intended for\nsmall enterprises for his\nrecreation centre and farm,\nwhich is part of the large\nconglomerate Agrofert.\nHe also allegedly cooperated with Communist\nsecret police during the\ntotalitarian regime. Babi\u0161\nrejects all these accusations as political attempts\nto destroy him.\nNow that ANO is\nin power, what can we\nexpect? Babi\u0161 is not a\nman of ideology, and that\nmakes him unpredictable.\nHowever, one can get an\nidea from his book where\nhe outlines his vision\nof Czech Republic in\n18 years: let\u2019s dissolve\nmunicipal councils,\nregional assemblies, and\nthe Senate, and streamline the system, he says;\nlet\u2019s run the state like a\ncompany. Such changes\nwould concentrate power\ninto the hands of a few,\nnamely the MPs and the\nmayors, and raise concern\nabout the preservation of\ndemocracy. The abolition\nof the Senate would also\nenable changes to the\nconstitution without mod-eration. Another concept\nthat Babi\u0161 would like to\nintroduce is direct democracy \u2013 an idea appealing to\nthe Pirates and SPD. Superficially, there is nothing\nas democratic as giving\nthe power to the people.\nHowever, one must be\nwary of the consequences\n\u2013 after all, many voters\ntend to decide emotionally\nrather than rationally, and\nsome decisions require\nexpertise in the subject.\nAs an example, direct\ndemocracy was one of the\nfactors explaining why\nwomen in Switzerland\nwere only granted suffrage\nin 1971. One of the first\nreferendums would inevitably be about \u201cCzexit\u201d, as\nthe anti-European mood\nis rising among Czechs.\nWhat would follow is\nunimaginable.\nWhere do the others\ncome in? The gamut of political views in the lower\nchamber is colourful\nand reaching agreement\nwill be difficult. None of\nthe parties is willing to\nform a coalition with the\nANO, with the exception\nof the SDP, but they are\njust as dismissive of a\nminority government.\nIt\u2019s only clear that there\nare many changes ahead:\npower within the parties is\nshifting as they deal with\ntheir defeats, and half of\nMPs have been replaced.\nThe lower chamber has\ndiversified as many\npoliticians under 30s and\nwomen were elected, but\nhas also become more\npolarized.\nCzech Republic took\na step in the populist,\nright-wing, anti-European\ndirection, much like its\nneighbours Germany,\nAustria, and Poland.\nWhere this road will lead\nis difficult to tell at the\nmoment \u2013 hopefully not\naway from democracy.\n\u201cThe persona\nof the ANO\u2019s\nAndrej Babi\u0161\nplayed a major\nrole in their\nsuccess in the\nCzech election\u201d\nthe political scene in 2011,\nwhen he founded his party,\nwhich he states was to\nexpress a dissatisfaction\nwith the corrupted state.\nAlthough he describes\nhimself as a self-made\nman, he largely benefited\nfrom his parents\u2019 positions\n\u201cDamn, Felix, back at it again with the sick graphs\u201d // Felix\nAndrej Babis is holding the cards // Wikimedia\n\n"

Tickets from\n\u00a310\nTHE LADY FROM THE\nSEA\nThe Lady from the Sea: An adaptation worth its salt?\nWe travel to the Caribbean by way of the Donmar Warehouse for a refreshing take on one of Ibsen\u2019s later works.\nD\nirected by\nK w a m e\nKwei-Armah\n\u2013 the British\nactor-cum-playwright and\nsoon to be artistic director\nof the Young Vic \u2013 The\nLady from the Sea tells a\nstory of marital oppression\nand lost love. Calypso\nmusic plays and algae\ngrows from the walls as\nKwei-Armah relocates the\nplay from 19th Century\nNorway to a tourist haven\nin the Caribbean. Here we\nfind Ellida, the lighthouse\nkeeper\u2019s daughter; though\nher situation is anything\nbut idyllic.\nEllida (Nikki Amuka-Bird) is the second\nwife of doctor Wangel\n(Finbar Lynch), serving\nas stepmother to his two\ndaughters. Her mental\nstate appears to be dete-riorating, and her daily\nmorning swims in the\nlagoon are becoming\nsomething of a compul-sion. Wangel writes to the\nformer tutor of his oldest\ndaughter and childhood\nfriend of his wife, in the\nhope that a visit from\na familiar figure will\nbring back the woman he\nmarried. We learn Ellida is\nhaunted by a teenage fling\nwith a seaman to whom\nshe became \u2018engaged\u2019\nbefore he was forced to\nflee. His power remains\nover her, forging a gap\nbetween her and the doctor\nuntil he returns to fetch his\nmermaid bride.\nAmuka-Bird gives an\nevocative performance\nof the glassy-eyed Ellida.\nShe appears serene yet\nstifled, creating the\nperfect level of distance\nbetween her and the other\ncharacters, most notably\nher husband. Although\nthe tale is centred around\nher struggles, she does\nnot dominate the stage,\nallowing the other players\nto hold their own. Lynch\ncomplements this with his\nportrayal of the devoted\ndoctor. He cossets his\nwife and seeks a cure for\nher detachment like one\nwould a clinical indisposi-tion, when we can all see\nthat the only medicine she\nrequires is freedom. Ellida\nis shackled by her wedding\nrings, to both Wangel\nand her absent mariner,\nand thus is left mercurial.\nThe audience is forced\nto consider marriage as a\nform of oppression and\nduty, a way for men to\nkeep their women at bay.\nSubplots are allowed\nto develop yet remain\nself-effacing, bringing in\nelements of tragicomedy\nas the tutor confuses the\n\u2018woman waiting\u2019 for him\ndescribed in the doctor\u2019s\nletter with his ex-pupil,\nand proposes to her. We\nlaugh at the clich\u00e9 love-veiled-with-hate romance\nbetween the younger\ndaughter Hilde \u2013 reem-ployed by Ibsen four years\nlater in The Master Builder\n\u2013 and a travelling tortured\nartiste. Ellie Bamber does\nan excellent job as the\npouting teenager, cruelly\nmocking the man she is\nclearly mad for (think Cher\nand Josh in Clueless). We\nenjoy to despise her target,\nthe struggling sculptor\nLyngstad (Jonny Holden),\nas his slapstick self-assur-ance provides a breath of\nfresh air from the melancholy of the main plot.\nWriter Elinor Cook\u2019s\nsophisticated revamp of\nthe text \u2013 originally written\nby Henrik Ibsen in 1888 \u2013\nto the 1950s works almost\nseamlessly. This is helped\nlargely by Ibsen\u2019s progressive humanism and use of\nstrong female characters\nwhich drove the play\nahead of its time. Cook\nand Kwei-Armah keep\na good balance between\nbourgeois realism and the\nsea shanty mythology of\nthe original fable. It must\nbe said, however, that what\nseemed like a constant\nrotation of two people on\nstage at once, combined\nwith sometimes-forced\nconversations and\nreceived pronunciation,\ndid leave me feeling like\nI was watching an episode\nof Made In Chelsea.\nThe location shift to the\nCaribbean post-colonisa-tion does bring rise to a\ndiscussion unintended by\nthe original Norwegian\ntext.

That could only\nmean one thing: it must\nbe the start of another year\nand another cross-country\nseason filled with mud,\nsweat, and beers. And\ncake.\nThe first challenge\nfacing the squad of 70 was\nnavigating the London\nUnderground to reach\ncross-country Mecca:\nParliament Hill. After\nsome confusion getting\nthe correct Tube line and\nOyster card top-up-related\ndelays, the team made\nit back above ground at\nBelsize Park and completed the remainder of\nthe journey on foot. They\narrived in good time\nbefore the starting gun,\nleaving the freshers and\nnew members plenty of\ntime to ogle at the size of\nthe challenging hill that\nfaced them from the start\nline. After some brief\nwarming-up, an obligatory\npre-race team photo taken\nby a rival team captain,\nand plenty of toilet stops,\nthe squad headed for the\nstart line at the base of the\nmammoth Mount Parly\nHill.\nThe race organiser\u2019s\ninstructions were barely\naudible after chants of\n\u201cI-C-X-C\u201d broke out\namongst the Imperial\nranks, and another slightly\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s time\nfor a big pull-quote. We love\nthese things,\nbut don\u2019t\nforget to make\nthem short!\u201d\n\u201cAfter the\nvaliant athletes\nhad regained\ntheir breath,\nthe cake\nbingeing soon\nbegan\u201d\nmore explicit ode started\nup amongst the team\nof King\u2019s College. Yet\nwithout much further ado\nthe race was underway\nwith a short blast on a\nwhistle, and the shouts and\nsongs of the athletes gave\nway to the rapid thuds of\n260 pairs of athletic legs\nascending the rather steep\nslope. Having donned the\nnotorious home-made\n\u201cKing of the Hill\u201d T-shirt,\nICXC-fresher Robbie\nHolland took on the tradition of racing to the top of\nthe hill, and impressively\nmade it up in 2nd place!\nHe later went on to remark\nthat the athlete who\nbeat him to the summit\nmanaged to maintain the\nridiculous pace whilst Rob\nhimself struggled around\nthe remaining 8km at a\nconsiderably slower speed\nthan the initial surge.\nOnce at the peak, the\nrace leaders struggled to\nfollow the questionable\nsignage but after a short\ndiversion around some\nminor foliage they were\nback on track, zooming\ndown the grassy tracks,\nacross the barren heathland and through muddy\nditches. Corner-cutting\nwas rife, but as any experienced racer knows: if a\nmarshal doesn\u2019t see it; it\ndidn\u2019t happen. The course\nwas a newly refined\nversion of the route from\nprevious years, with the\ngirls completing 2 gruelling laps of the park and\nthe boys undertaking an\neven more gruelling 3.\nIn the Men\u2019s race of\n146, star performer Chris\nOlley led the way home in\njust under 29 minutes, and\nwas reasonably closely\nfollowed by Chris Thomas\nin 5th place, and club\nfavourite Harry Scriven in\n9th place. Oliver Newton\nplaced 18th and Daniel\nAyers had no problems\ncompeting against his\nalma matter King\u2019s, finishing in 25th and rounding\noff Imperial\u2019s A team. This\nplaced the team in 2nd\nplace in the league and just\n3 points behind Brunel in\n1st, but more importantly\n14 points ahead of arch-ri-vals UCL (who currently\nsit in the bronze medal\nposition). In the Women\u2019s\nrace of 113, Sarah Johnson\nbreezed to 2nd place in\n22:24, followed by Kate\nOlding in 5th, Women\u2019s\nCaptain Anna in 9th and\nhighest-ranking fresher\nGeorgia Curry in 10th.\nUnsurprisingly, with all 4\nteam members in the top\n10, the Women\u2019s A team\nnow sit top of the league,\nrest of the squad to a\nsprint finish and regained\ntheir breath, the cake\nbingeing soon began. The\nfirst baking session of the\nseason was of a very high\ncalibre, with top quality\nbaked goods brought from\nall corners of the club\nfrom freshers to finalists.\nFor the post race socials\nthe squad\u2019s thoughts initially remained with food;\nheading to the local GBK\nto the joy of the manager\n(who made the team pose\nthrough an Instagram\nframe without offering\nsponsorship). After filling\ntheir stomachs to satis-faction, thoughts quickly\nturned to sourcing refreshing beverages, with the\nteam meeting at Acton\u2019s\nfinest bowling alley for a\ncouple of games of skittles\nand more than a couple of\nthe aforementioned beers\nto celebrate a thoroughly\nsuccessful start to the\ncross-country season.\nThe next race in the\nLUCA XC League is on 1st\nNovember, meeting in Beit\nQuad at 1pm.

Politicians take to the stage to discuss the current\nstateoftheparty,setouttheirambitionsforthefollowingyear,andphysically\ndemonstrate that they understand the UK stretches beyond its capitals.\nPOLITICS\nRatan Gor\nPolitics Writer\nP-45s, writing on the\nwall, and coughing \u2013\nthe Tory conference\novershadowed by the\nPM\u2019s speech\nManchester hosted the\nConservatives and their\ndelegates this year. The\nquestion on everyone\u2019s\nmind was whether the\nPrime Minister would\nremain leader for much\nlonger, and who from her\ninner circle was itching\nto replace her after an\nembarrassing general\nelection campaign. The\nwho, it turns out, was\nBoris Johnson. The\nformer London Mayor\nand current Foreign Secretary has been gunning\nfor the top job and now\nsmells blood after Mrs.\nMay\u2019s disastrous General\nElection result, which\nsaw the Tories go from\na majority to a minority\ngovernment. Mrs. May\nhas been haemorrhaging\nsupport since, and Boris\nsmelled blood.\nIn other news, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond,\nmade a speech during\nthe conference defending\ncapitalism and free-mar-ket economics, accusing\nLabour of leading people\n\u201cdown a dangerous path\u201d\nthrough their left-leaning\npolicies.\nThe Home Secretary,\nAmber Rudd, discussed\nbanning acid sales after a\nworrying spike in attacks\nresulting in devastating\ninjuries in recent months.\nShe also brought to the\nforefront the discussion on\ntech company regulation\nand granting authorities\naccess to messages on platforms such as WhatsApp\nthat currently have end-to-end encryption, arguing\nthat such platforms were\n\u201chelping criminals\u201d.\nThe most memorable\naddress, however, was that\nof the Prime Minister\u2019s.\nShe was plagued by a\ntickly cough throughout\nher speech, detracting\nfrom the importance of\nthe messages she was\nattempting to convey. If\nher upper-respiratory tract\nwoes weren\u2019t bad enough,\na prankster managed to\nhand her a P45 \u2013 a form\ntelling an employee that\nthey are fired \u2013 stating it\nwas from Boris. If those\nweren\u2019t enough, the sign\nbehind the PM started\nfalling apart during the\nspeech: the writing on \u2013\nor falling off \u2013 the wall\nperhaps symbolised Ms.\nMay\u2019s current cabinet \u2013\nfractured and in need of\nrepair.\nFinally, to add insult to\ninjury, Boris and much of\nthe cabinet actually had to\nbe cajoled at the end of the\nspeech to join in with the\nclosing standing ovation.\n\u201cWe have become a\ngovernment-in-waiting\u201d \u2013 Labour\u2019s call to\narms for another election\nLabour graced the\nseaside town of Brighton\nfor their rendezvous this\nyear. The atmosphere\nbetween Labour MPs\nseemed amicable, with\nthe mutinous MPs who\nlast year would\u2019ve wanted\nnothing more than to see\nCorbyn replaced with a\ncleanly shaven Blair 2.0\nappearing placated after\nhis better-than-expected\nperformance in the\nGeneral Election.\nMuch was discussed\nat the conference. There\nwere some typical left-wing speeches about\ncapping interest rates on\ncredit cards, nationalising\nindustries such as rail,\nwater, and energy, raising\nthe minimum wage to\nthe highest in Europe,\nand taxing corporations\nfurther.\nHowever, much beyond\nthis was discussed.\nEverything from the\napocalyptic hurricanes\nplaguing the Atlantic\nand the role climate\nchange was playing in\nsuch devastating events,\nto automation of jobs in\nthe future and how the\ncountry should prepare for\nsuch disruption.\nThe overwhelming\ntheme, however, was\nJeremy Corbyn. \u201cOh\nJe-re-my Cor-byn\u201d was\nchanted at every opportunity like a case of\nherd-induced Tourette\u2019s.\nIt appeared as though\nLabour were rallying the\ntroops for another election,\nbut this may, however,\nbe premature and in vain,\nconsidering the realistically slim chance of the\nTories collapsing and\nceding their power.\nHe (or his PR team)\ncertainly can satiate the\nyouth, however. He was\nasked whether he wanted\nto take off his jacket at a\nfringe event to which he\nretorted, \u201cthe man\u2019s not\nhot\u201d \u2013 referencing the\nlatest phenomenon to grip\nsocial media: \u2018the ting\ngoes\u2019 memes. Although\nthe line was perhaps his\nmost awkwardly deliv-ered, and was as cringe-worthy as seeing your\ndad dance at New Year\u2019s,\nit was nonetheless lapped\nup by his young backers.\nAt the start of his closing\nspeech, he mentions how\nthe atmosphere of the\ncrowd was infectious and\nthat they should all make\nsure \u201cthe whole country\nis infected with the same\nthing\u201d (puzzled emoji).\nEvery meme he touches\nturns viral so perhaps he is\nonto something.\nLiberal Democrats\nlimber up to regain\ntheir position\nThe Lib Dems took a\ntrip to the seaside as they\nopened the conference\nseason in Bournemouth.\nSir Vince Cable, the\nformer business secretary\nand newly appointed\nparty leader, is attempting\nto reclaim the position\nof the third largest party\nafter being punished for\ngoing into coalition with\nthe Conservatives back in\n2010 and breaking crucial\nmanifesto promises, such\nas the infamous tuition\nfee increase backtrack.\nThe humbling experience\nresulted in their 57 strong\nMPs all but disappearing,\nleaving only 8 standing\ntoday.\nThey are now in rebuilding and rebranding\nmode, wanting to become\nthe party of \u201cno Brexit is\nbetter than a bad Brexit\u201d,\nand once again lure the\nyouth, as well as appealing to the snubbed 48%\nwho voted to stay in the\nEU. During the confer-ence, delegates agreed to\ncommit to a referendum\non the final Brexit deal,\nwith the option to stay in\nthe EU.\nAlso, on the agenda\nwere discussions about\nradical tax reform to tax\nwealth rather than work,\ncreating disincentives for\nsecond homes, tax penalties on properties acquired\nfor investment purposes\nby overseas residents, and\nThis was the only copyright-free image we could get from the Tory conference... // Wikimedia\nchanges to, you guessed it,\ntuition fees. Although, on\nthe final point they stopped\nshort of committing to\nanything specific, leaving\nit as the open statement\n\u201crethink the student debt\nburden\u201d because \u201cthe\nworry about debt does\ncause students and their\nfamilies real concern\u201d.\nThe Lib Dems have\nalways put forward\nconvincing arguments\nand policies that appeal\nto both the left and right.\nHowever, from the con-ference, it appears that\ntheir current task is to\nconvince delegates and\npotential members that\nthey can deliver on these\nas opposed to offering\nfalse pledges.\nThe SNP take to Glasgow\nThe Scottish National\nParty, fronted by their\nleader Nicola Sturgeon,\nheld their conference in\nGlasgow.\nThe General Election\nfor the SNP was a big\nsetback: they lost twen-ty-one parliamentary\nseats, but remain in power\nin Scotland alongside the\nScottish Greens.\nKey points from the\nconference included\npledging to create a state-owned energy company\nin Scotland that offers the\ncheapest power \u2013 \u201crenewable of course\u201d \u2013 to home-owners, and a \u00a320,000\nbursary to professionals\nto go towards retraining as\na teacher \u2013 due to current\nshortages. Scottish Labour\nhas said that such policies\nhad been \u201cphotocopied\u201d\nfrom their own proposals.\nThe SNP also said that\nthey would pay residency\nfees for EU citizens\ncurrently working in the\nScottish public sector,\nand so protect 20,000 EU\nnationals currently with\njobs in hospitals, schools,\nuniversities, and public\nagencies.\nThey also voted for\na motion calling for a\nban on under-18s being\nrecruited by the UK armed\nforces in roles requiring\ncombat training. Speakers\nat the conference said that\nthe military was purposely\ntargeting youth from\nlow-income backgrounds\nthrough social media\nadvertising. They argued\nthat enlisting those under\neighteen increased their\nrisk of death in battle,\npost-traumatic stress\ndisorder, and alcohol\nabuse. Critics of this,\nhowever, argue that the\nmotion ignores issues\nregarding pay, equipment,\nand housing, and would\ndeny opportunities to\nsome youngsters.\nPlaid Cymru set out\ntheir vision for Wales\nPlaid Cymru, the party\nfrom Wales, held their\nconference in Caernarfon\nlast week.\nLeader Leanne Wood,\nand her party, promised\na \u201crail revolution\u201d,\noffering new routes across\nthe country as well as\nproviding education and\nre-training to the over\n290,000 workers in Wales\nthreatened by increasing\nautomation and technology disruptions. On Brexit,\nPlaid stated that people\nmust have the opportunity\nto reject the disastrous\nsituation of a no-deal\nscenario, either through a\npublic vote or via a parliamentary democracy on the\nmatter.\nGreens set out their\npolicies to protect the\nenvironment\nThe Green party, jointly\nheaded by Caroline Lucas\nand Jonathan Bartley,\narrived in Harrogate,\nNorth Yorkshire for their\nconference. In the General\nelection, their vote share\nwas reduced, but they\nretained their Brighton\nPavilion parliamentary\nseat.\nDuring the conference,\nthey stated that they had\n\u201csuffered\u201d because of a\ntwo-party system, but\nthat their environmentally\nconsiderate ideas and\npolicies were now part of\nthe mainstream and that\ntheir aim was to be \u201cthe\nmost influential\u201d party in\n21st\nCentury politics.\nIssues and policies\ndiscussed related to: electoral reforms regarding\nthe need for a proportional voting system as\nopposed to a two-party\none; offshore wind energy\nprices dropping below that\nof nuclear \u2013 necessitating\nthe need for Hinkley Point\nC to be reconsidered; a\nfour-day working week;\nthe Grenfell Tower\ntragedy; and what Brexit\nwould mean for the\nenvironment. On the last\npoint, Jonathan Bartley\nstated that the \u201cGreen\nBrexit\u201d the Conservatives\nhad been proposing was\nan oxymoron, stating that\n\u201calmost by definition the\nConservatives seem to be\nanti-environment\u201d, and\ntheir recent decisions on\nfracking and fossil-fuel\nsubsidies did not align\nwith a green vision.\n\u00a7\nConferences offer\ninteresting insights and\nopportunities to compare\npositions of the different\nparties and its members on\nkey issues, allowing us to\nthink about who we might\nvote for, the next time the\noccasion should arise \u2013 the\nfabric of a democracy.\nThe Absolute Boy looking at home during the conference // Wikimedia\nNot now mate, I\u2019m the one with the microphone // Wikimedia\n\n"

But, of course, in\nIC Radio the main service\nwe provide is the ability to\npresent shows. If you\u2019re\npresenting a show you\u2019re\ndoing it to entertain, relay\ninformation, or get people\ninterested in a particular\ngenre of music.\nA: You say you\u2019re not\nartistic, but you\u2019re\nvery into DJ\u2019ing,\nwhich is definitely an\nart-form.\nS: Yeah, I DJ on IC Radio.\nMy show is called Record\nSurgery because I think\nthere\u2019s something quite\nbeautiful about DJ\u2019ing\nwith vinyl. But personally,\nI wouldn\u2019t call DJ\u2019ing an\nart form, because it\u2019s so\nsimple now. The basic\nidea of DJ\u2019ing is to match\nBPMs \u2013 the speed of songs\n\u2013 in order to mix one song\ninto the other and new\nsoftware makes that super\neasy. I\u2019ll probably piss of\nthe whole of Music Tech\nSociety by saying that. I\nwill admit that the difference between a good and\nbad DJ is song selection,\nand you\u2019ll find people who\nwax lyrical about how you\nshould take the listener\non a journey. Sometimes\nyou hear that well done,\nbut ninety-five percent\nof the time people fail at\nthat. People think \u201cI\u2019m a\nDJ, I need to play bangers\nall the time\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m a\ntech-house DJ and I need\nto play boring shit for two\nhours straight\u201d. There\u2019s\nan old DJ Marky jungle\nmix that\u2019s really good at\ntaking you on that journey\nthrough the historical progression of that genre. At\nImperial, I like the variety\nof the music Debesh\nMandal plays on his show\n[The Big Daddy Hour] and\nI admire the fact that he\nuses vinyl.\nA: Through running\nthe society and hanging out in the West\nBasement you definitely spend a lot of\ntime with artsy peo-ple, even if you don\u2019t\nconsider yourself one.\nDo you think Imperial\nstudents perform well\nat balancing their academic lives in science\nand their artistic side?\nS: One thing that I notice\nis even though we have a\nlot of work, as Imperial\nstudents we all have quite\nhigh ambitions. Most of\nus, if we try to do some-thing, we try to do it really\nwell. For example, Joseph\nO\u2019Connell, the photographer for Felix, has been a\nprofessional since before\nuniversity and some of the\nDramSoc people are really\ngood despite studying, say,\nMaterials. Nothing I have\nlearnt studying Chemical\nEngineering has ever\nhelped me with Radio:\nthere\u2019s no plumbing in\nRadio.\nI find it interesting that\ndespite being such a technical university there\u2019s so\nmany artsy types. I see it\nparticularly in those who\nstudy Physics and Maths\n\u2013 maybe because they\u2019re\nsuch pure sciences \u2013 that\nthey\u2019re just attracted to\nlearning in all forms. I was\nreading a Feynman quote\nwhere he said, \u201cPhysics\nis a bit like sex: sure, it\nmay give some practical\nresults, but that\u2019s not why\nwe do it\u201d. No engineer\nwould ever be that poetic.\nA: Is your interest in\nradio and DJ\u2019ing purely a hobby for you, or\ndo you see either of\nthem as a future ca-reer? And if the latter,\nwhy are you studying\nChemical Engineering\nat all?\nS: I flirted with the idea of\nstudying Sound Engineering at university; I was\nreally into music production before I came to uni-versity. I read a lot about\nthe basic maths of sound,\nso I knew about Fourier\nseries, for example, before\nI came to university. But I\nwanted to learn more about\nwhy the world works. You\ncan learn about radio, or\nhistory, or politics in your\nown time and understand\nit. But engineering and\nmaths are too complicated to simply pick up a\ntextbook and understand.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever go\ninto radio or media as a\njob, but I plan on continuing with radio as a hobby\nonce I leave university.\nOne of my heroes is Ben\nGoldacre: he\u2019s a physician\nbut he\u2019s also a journalist,\nand wrote the books Bad\nScience and Bad Pharma.\nIf I could plan out my life,\nI\u2019d do the same: have a\ntechnical job, but also let\nthe world know what your\nwork entails by going on\nradio, or writing articles.\nI think science communication is important, but I\nfind the science itself too\ninteresting to focus solely\non the communication.\nA: What sort of job\nare you looking to go\ninto?\nS: My criteria for a future\ncareer is that it must have\nsome positive impact\non the world. I wouldn\u2019t\nwant to go into research\nas I find it too abstract, but\nworking in something like\nrenewable energy would\nfulfil that goal.\nA: At, for example,\nthe University of\nWestminster there\u2019s\na full-time Radio Production course. At\nImperial, we have no\nundergraduates who\nstudy radio. Do you\nthink the quality of IC\nRadio\u2019s output suffers\nas a result?\nS: I think if we had a\nradio or general media\ncourse we could do a lot\nmore. But, despite that,\nall media at Imperial is\nreally active. Definitely on\nIn the second instalment of the series, IC Radio Station Manager Sebastian Gonzato sat down with Arts Editor\n(and former IC Radio Station Manager) Adam Gellatly, to discuss the role radio has to play in the arts at Imperial.\nSeb didn\u2019t choose the thug life, the thug life chose him // Felix\nthe tech side we\u2019re really\ngood, compared to other\nuniversities. I did a year\nabroad in Switzerland last\nyear \u2013 the radio studio\nthere was not as good as\nIC Radio\u2019s and they had a\nlot more technical issues.\nBut in Switzerland they\nhad students studying\njournalism for whom radio\nwas a career path and not\na hobby, so they spent a\nlot more time in the studio\n[compared to Imperial\nstudents].\nA:Ifyouhadtochoose\nto be a part of only IC\nRadio or your station\nin Switzerland which\nwould you pick?\nS: IC Radio for sure. I\u2019ve\ndeveloped an irrational\nattachment to this station,\nwhich is probably a bit\nunhealthy. But I\u2019d love if\nwe had a sofa or a fridge\nin the studio here like they\ndid in Switzerland.\nA: Compared to other arts and media societies at Imperial, it\nseems like IC Radio\nreaches a much smaller audience. If radio\nis about entertaining\nbut your audience is\nvery small, why are\npeople attracted to\nthe club?\nS: For a start, it\u2019s entertaining for you, the host.\nI\u2019ve done shows with only\nthree listeners and it\u2019s\nbeen fun to just play tunes.\nYou also learn a lot. If you\nlisten back to yourself\nyou find you have a lot of\nverbal ticks. And you also\nlearn to plan what you\u2019re\ngoing to say and how\nto finish a point without\ntailing off.\nA: Last year it seemed\nlike IC Radio was split\ninto three distinct\ngroups: the traditional group who produce their own shows\nweekly, the Science\nCommunication students who do radio\nas part of the course,\nand those in Music\nTech who are slowly taking over as the\nlargest demographic.\nDo you think IC Radio\n\u2013 and radio as an art\n\u2013 has lost its identity\nand ability to survive\non its own merits?\nS: The big thing that\u2019s\nchanged since 1975\n[when IC Radio was\nfounded] and now is that\nno one listens to the radio\nanymore, whereas DJ\u2019ing\nis now huge. But I think\nradio is very good in\nallowing people to train\ntheir presenting and play\ntheir music. Music will\nstill exist, mics will still\nexist, recording will still\nexist, even if radio as a\nmedium for entertainment\nand disseminating information won\u2019t.\nThe full and unedited\nversion of this interview\ncan be found online, at the\nICRadioPodcast Mixcloud\npage\nAll the Little Lights: A Story That Needs Telling\nARTS\nVaishnavi\nGnanananthan\nArts Writer\nWhere? Arcola Theatre\nWhen? Until 4th\nNovember\nHow Much? \u00a317; \u00a314 concession\nALL THE LITTLE\nLIGHTS\nJ\nane Upton\u2019s All the\nLittle Lights looks\nat the world of child\nsexual exploitation\nfrom the perspective of\nthe young girls who are\nmost often its victims.\nIt allows you to see\nthe seemingly obvious\nfactors at play in their\nlives \u2013 poverty, isolation,\npeer pressure \u2013 that make\nthem vulnerable to abuse.\nWhen stories such as the\nRochdale case shock us\nand make us wonder how\nthis can happen, All the\nLittle Lights offers some\ninsight into how the lines\nbetween harmless fun\nand danger appear to blur\nfor the children involved.\nThis is important to help\nus understand how this\nhappens: how children,\neven those with families\nthat seem to care about\nthem, can fall through the\ncracks in the system and in\nsociety.\nThree young girls,\nJoanne, Lisa, and Amy,\nare the only characters\nin the play, an important\nchoice, as we see the story\nonly from their perspec-tive. At the centre of the\nplay is Joanne, who is\nthrowing an impromptu\nbirthday party for her\nfriend Lisa in a tent by the\nrailway. Their relationship\nclearly complicated, as\nLisa is in foster care and\nhas been missing from\nJoanne\u2019s life, so much so\nthat Joanne has used desperate means to find Lisa,\nposting a missing persons\nad on Facebook. This is\none of the first hints that\nsomething is wrong, that\nthere is something hidden\nin the shared past between\nLisa and Joanne.\n12-year-old Amy seems\nto be Lisa\u2019s replacement in\nJoanne\u2019s life and their relationship is also complex.\nAmy clearly idolizes\nJoanne, whilst Joanne\u2019s\nattitude to Amy is callous\nand often cruel. We learn\nthat Joanne has introduced\nAmy to \u2018TJ\u2019, the local\nchippy, which seems\ninnocuous until we learn\nthat TJ wants pictures of\nAmy\u2019s breasts \u2013 the first\nhint at what is going on.\nLisa is clearly terrified of\nTJ, indicating the role he\nhas played in the lives of\nLisa and Joanne; we gradually learn more about\ntheir experiences and what\nLisa has escaped from.\nThe story and its characters are based on abuse\nsurvivors that Upton\nmet through charity Safe\nand Sound, who works\nto protect children from\nsexual exploitation.\nJoanne, in particular, is\nbased on the story of a\nvictim that Upton met\nwho had recruited other,\nyounger, children into\nexploitation. Joanne is an\ninteresting character \u2013 it\u2019s\neasy to villainise her, easy\nto see her as part of the\nproblem, as guilty as \u2018TJ\u2019\nand the others involved.\nHowever, there is a clear\nundercurrent of desperation and adolescent\nconfusion and, as the play\nprogresses, her own fear\nand her motivations for\nwhat she has done become\nclearer and it is obvious\nthat she is as much a\nvictim as the other girls.\nThe quality of the performance unfortunately\nlets down the subject\nmatter and Upton\u2019s\nwriting. Tessie Orange-Turner is powerful\nas Joanne, but the performances from Sarah Hoare\n(Lisa) and Esther-Grace\nButton (Amy) are incon-sistent. Button\u2019s attempts\nat capturing 12-year-old\nAmy often feel forced, and\nthere are many moments\nof over exaggeration.\nHoare\u2019s performance\nas Lisa improves as the\nplay progresses, and the\ndynamic between Lisa\nand Joanne intensifies,\nbut many aspects of her\nperformance fall flat.\nThis is only emphasized\nby the staging of the play in\nthe intimate setting of the\nArcola\u2019s Studio 2, which\nleaves the actors bare to\nthe audience: the action\nfeels too close and the\nperformers are hampered\nby the lack of stage space.\nHowever, some aspects of\nthe staging work very well:\nan elevated area serves as\nthe railway lines and is the\nsetting of several of the\nmost powerful moments in\nthe performance. The girls\nplay a version of \u2018chicken\u2019\non the railway lines,\ndaring each other to stay\non as a train approaches.\nStark lighting enhances\nthe moment and captures\nthe courage and the sheer\ndesperation the girls are\nfeeling.\nStrong emotion characterizes all of the best\nmoments of the play.When\nLisa talks of the people\nliving in distant houses -the \u2018little lights\u2019 they can\nsee in the distance - Joanne\nbegs Lisa to run away with\nher, to keep walking up\nthe tracks to the station to\ntake a train and escape the\nplace they\u2019ve found themselves in; there\u2019s so much\ndesperation encapsulated\nhere that you can\u2019t help\nbut be moved.\nAll the Little Lights is a\nplay worth seeing for the\nsubject matter alone and\n\u2013 despite some of the limitations of the performance\n\u2013 it shines a much-needed\nspotlight on an important\nissue.\nAll the Little Lights at the Arcola // Robert Day\n\n"

La Belle Sauvage\nis the much-anticipated\nfirst volume of The Book\nof Dust, which Pullman\ndiscussed with BBC\nbroadcaster and fellow\nauthor Cerys Matthews\nat a launch event at the\nSouthbank Centre. The\nevening began with a discussion between the two,\nfollowed by a reading of\nan extract by Pullman, and\nthe discussion was then\nopened to the audience.\nIn this new volume, the\ntheory of dust from His\nDark Materials makes\na reappearance after 17\nyears, in a world where\ndark matter and consciousness intertwine. The\nauthor or, as he prefers,\nstoryteller, combined\nfamous theories of\nphysics, complex politics,\nand religion in a world\nof witches, daemons, and\narmoured polar bears.\nThis exciting new\ntrilogy is the unexpected\nprequel to His Dark\nMaterials. The original\nwas famously known for\nits beloved heroine, Lyra\nBelacqua, who makes\na comeback in the new\nseries as a baby. This\nlatest novel has a more elementary \u2013 or as Philip dedience\u2019s singing echoed\nin the hall. The viewers\u2019\nawe was palpable when\nPhilip read an extract of\nLa Belle Sauvage. Discussions ranged from Philip\u2019s\n\u201cwaywardish\u201d university\ndays to his journeys to the\nArctic within the pages\nof books of the Bodleian\nLibrary, at Oxford University. We find how his\nroots in Oxford inspired\na range of settings for His\nDark Materials and La\nBelle Sauvage as well as\nthe influence of the more\nexotic scenes from books\nhe\u2019s read.\nThe most intriguing part\nof Pullman\u2019s discussion\nwas the use of rhythm in\nhis sentences and how he\nneeds silence in order to\nfocus on the rhythms of\nfollowing sentences. In\naddition, he also touched\non children\u2019s style of\nlearning and reading \u2013 he\nbelieves imagination\nbegins when children\nare read stories by their\nparents or guardians,\nwhich encourages the\nseeking of adventures and\nideas within books. He\nexpressed disappointment\nat the current educational\nsystem, which ranks\nchildren and forces youngsters to form opinions and\nexpress them aloud to the\nteacher \u2013 opinions and\nanalysis of poems should\nremain within the heart\nof the child, he said, so\nthey can look back and\nremember the naturality\nwas the darker tone due\nto the growing cynicism\nof the author? Does it\nreflect on the growing\ncynicism of adults in the\nmodern world? When\nasked this, he replied that\nadults don\u2019t become more\ncynical, only more aware,\nbut amongst the darkness\nof it all there is always\nhope \u2013 interspersed in the\ndarkness of the book, just\nlike in our reality.\nAudience\u2019s questions\nalso sparked riveting\ndiscussions where two\nin particular caught the\nauthor off guard, which he\nseemed to appreciate: one\nspectator questioned how\nthe integration of the sex-ualisation of young people\nthrough social media and\nwider access to porn on\nthe internet would work\nin the world of magic\nborn from the innocence\nof children; another asked\nabout the integration of\ndisability, particularly\ndeaf people, and how they\nwould communicate with\ntheir daemons. Though\nthe answer to both of these\nquestions was \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d, he commented\non how his books were\nwritten in an age where\n\u201cThe latest\nnovel is\ntangled\nwith the\nissues of the\nenvironment\nand inequality\u201d\nscribed it, \u201cwatery\u201d \u2013 feel\nwhich is tangled with the\nissues of the environment\nand inequality in a fiercer\ntone than before.\nThe fact that it was\nhis birthday made the\nevening\u2019s atmosphere\nmore magical as the au-the internet did not exist.\nAs for disability, perhaps\ndaemons could use sign\nlanguage for communica-tion.\nIf you\u2019re as big as a fan\nas I am it would be good\nto know that Pullman\ndisclosed his daemon to\nus as a \u201cshabby, knock-kneed, feathers missing,\ndust-covered, old raven\u201d.\nHis second book of The\nBook of Dust is written,\n\u201cPullman\nsaid that\nknowledge\nand the\nseeking of it is\nwhat makes us\nhuman\u201d\nof their own opinion. His\nstand on the \u201coriginal\nsin\u201d, which is mentioned\nin his previous trilogy,\nis that it is \u201calmost blasphemous\u201d to call it a sin,\nbecause knowledge and\nthe seeking of it is what\nmakes us human. A round\nof applause followed with\nbouts of cheering.\nThe evening\u2019s discussion touched on a wide\nrange of topics and themes;\n\u201cAmongst the\ndarkness of La\nBelle Sauvage\nthere is always\nhope, just like\nin our own\nreality\u201d\nbut has yet to be edited.\nIn the meantime, La Belle\nSauvage will keep us all\noccupied.\nPart of London Literature Festival at the\nSouthbank Centre\nPhilip Pullman makes his triumphant return to the world he created in His Dark Materials // Caspar Stevens/Pengion/Michael Leckie\nAli Smith\u2019s Autumn is more than just a post-Brexit\nmanifesto\nThe innovative and poetic portrayal of a country in turmoil and the lessons learnt is deserving of its Man Booker\nPrize nomination\nBOOKS\nAlice Peberdy\nBooks Editor\nHamish Hamilton. 272 pp.\nAUTUMN\nby Ali Smith\nB\nooks which lack\nspeech marks\nalways scare me.\nIt can seem like\nthey\u2019re trying too hard\njust to break a rule and\nlook contemporary. But I\nshould never have doubted\nAli Smith, in whose new\nbook, Autumn, it feels\nentirely appropriate. It\nfreed the author to skip\nbetween characters and\nto entwine her own voice\nwith the text. No visual\nbreaks signal a change in\nthe dialogue and the fictional people seep into our\nreality. It feels like they\nwould fit in.\nElisabeth is a lecturer in\nhistory of art, although her\njob isn\u2019t entirely stable.\nShe is on a mission to\nrenew her passport. Daniel\nis her \u201cartsy art\u201d friend\nfrom childhood with a\ncentury\u2019s worth of wisdom\nto impart. He is holed up\nin a care home, always\nasleep and allegedly close\nto death. Jumps through\ntime allow glimpses into\ntheir relationship and\nbeautifully ordinary lives.\nNothing they do seems\nimpossible, although they\nhave some pretty wacky\ndreams. It is a joy to come\nacross the usual opener\nof their conversations,\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you reading?\u201d,\nbecause what follows is\nalways filled with quiet\ntenderness.\nFrom their first meeting\nwhen Elisabeth is eight,\nDaniel provides many\nlessons. He\u2019s a patient\nteacher, and very clearly\npart of the novel for a\nreason. To begin with it\nfelt a little too obvious:\neach time he appeared\nit was very obviously\nsignposted that you should\nstart thinking. Daniel is\nteaching Elisabeth, and\nDaniel is teaching you.\nAre you following? Once\nI accepted this, and once\nI got my head around\nsome of the statements, I\nwas drawn into the finer\nelements of his character.\nThe mystery of his past\nand his pitiful future\nwere enough to keep me\nengaged when he appeared\non the page.\nAutumn is a \u201cnovel\nof ideas\u201d, and every\nsentence, spoken by\nDaniel or not, seems to\nlead you into some deeper\nmeaning. Towards the end,\nan entire chapter abandons\nthe fictional characters to\nturn its focus to two scandalous real-life women:\nPauline Boty and Christine\nKeeler. I had previously\nheard of neither and the\nnovel has given me a lot\nof homework. Keeler\nrocketed into the public\nsphere through her affair\nwith British politician\nJohn Profumo and was the\nsubject of one of Boty\u2019s\npop-art paintings. Their\nchapter revolves around\nthe tragedy and beauty of\ntheir lives, but felt a little\nisolated from the rest of\nthe novel, both in its style\nand in the fact it was the\nonly segment focussed\nupon the year 1962.\nHowever, this section\nwas the definitive culmination of many strong\nhints towards the theme\nof feminism. It finally\nstruck me that all the main\ncharacters \u2013 at least the\nconscious ones \u2013 were\nwomen. They are clever,\nwitty, and, most impor-tantly, expressive. By the\nend of the novel, they each\nhave a passion which they\njoyously work for.\nThis was not the main\ntopic that I expected from\nthis novel. \u201cPost-Brexit\u201d\nis a phrase that appears\nin almost every article\nthat there is on the book.\nIts presence was obvious,\nbut the message was\nnot what I expected.\nInstead of focussing on a\npolitical standing, Smith\ntook Brexit, along with\nthe Profumo affair, and\ndecided to explore how\na country copes with the\nlies it is fed. The turmoil\npresented is juxtaposed\nwith discussions of art,\nliterature, ballet, and other\ncultural exploits. Expression is portrayed as the\ncarrier truth and a symbol\nof hope.\nSmith illustrates\nthis sentiment with the\nseason for which the\nnovel is named. At the\nvery end of the novel\nit is November and the\nseason is changing: leaves\nare dying, the weather is\ngloomy. \u201cAll the souls are\nout marauding. But there\nare roses, there are still\nroses.\u201d Despite the decay,\nthere is persistence and\nhope.\nAt times it seemed\nbest to give in to Smith\u2019s\ntorrent of educational\nthought and accept that I\nwouldn\u2019t follow. Instead\nof stopping, going back\na page, and fretting over\nevery minute detail,\nmaximum enjoyment can\nbe drawn from sitting back\nand enjoying the flow\nfrom each word to the\nnext, sentence to sentence.\nThe nuances can wait until\nanother time, another read.\nThe language is simple but\nstrange. Experimental paragraphs mostly containing\nseemingly random strings\nof words break the rules of\nplot and progression.\nIt truly feels like one\nlong poem, a form remarkably sustained throughout\nthe entire journey.\nThe most remarkable\nthing about the novel is\nthat Smith wrote it in such\na short period of time. The\nrelease date was just four\nmonths after the fateful\nvote. The topic remains a\nsore subject in Britain and\nmany of the situations portrayed feel all too familiar.\nIt is as the novel itself\nsays \u201can old story so new\nthat it\u2019s still in the middle\nof happening, writing\nitself right now with no\nknowledge of where or\nhow it\u2019ll end.\u201d The story\nis just a snapshot of events\nwhich continue beyond its\nend. As time goes on, this\nbook will always remain\nin 2016 and take anyone\nwho cares to read it back\nto that time.\nI can\u2019t say Autumn\nchanged my life, but it\ncertainly made me think.\nAnd the seasons, they go round and round // Hamish Hamilton/Wikimedia\n\n"

Starring:\nKristin Scott Thomas;\nTimothy Spall; Patricia\nClarkson; Emily Mortimer.\n71 minutes\nTHE PARTY\nI\nf you\u2019d just been\npromoted to Shadow\nMinister for Health,\nwouldn\u2019t you feel that\na small party might be in\norder? Just a small get\ntogether with your nearest\nand dearest surely couldn\u2019t\nhurt. Well, after watching\nThe Party, it turns out you\nmay want to reconsider.\nA sharp and deeply\nfunny chamber piece, this\nblack comedy is brought\nto life by its stellar cast.\nHeading up is Janet\n(Kristin Scott Thomas)\nas the recently promoted\nShadow Minister, thrilled\nto scale these political\nheights. Co-hosting the\nparty is her husband Bill\n(Timothy Spall), a man\nwho gave up his career to\nhelp propel her to the top.\nJoining them is Janet\u2019s\ncynical childhood friend\nApril (Patricia Clarkson),\nwho\u2019s brought along\nher estranged partner,\nthe \u2018spiritual\u2019 life-coach\nGottfried (played by\nBruno Ganz \u2013 Hitler from\nthe Downfall memes).\nRounding off the cast are\nCherry Jones and Emily\nMortimer as mothers\nto be Martha and Jinny,\nand Cillian Murphy as a\nbanker married to Janet\u2019s\nspin doctor, a man thoroughly tired of all these\nchampagne socialists.\nabout long term relation-ships, and maintaining\nhappiness through change.\nBoth written and directed\nby Sally Potter, who\nover the years has won\nshedloads of awards for\nfilms including Orlando\nand The Tango Lesson,\nThe Party is filled with\ntension from the get-go,\npitching characters against\neach other and bringing\nout unanimously brilliant\nperformances from every\nmember of the cast. The\nmost striking directorial\nchoice however, is using\nblack and white cine-matography, giving a kind\nof eerie timelessness and\ninevitability to the plot.\nFor all its strengths, the\nfilm isn\u2019t perfect. Most\nnoticeably, at time the\nscript can be a bit clunky,\nespecially in the early\nscenes. As Bill, Timothy\nSpall affects a spaced-out\nmanner, which is sort of\nexplained but never really\njustified, and all the characters can have a propensity to dip into caricature\nat the big moments. Yet\nthe good vastly outweighs\nthe bad.\nNot only is it laugh-out-loud funny, but sweet and\nthoughtful. The monochrome filming keeps you\nfar enough away to see the\nhumour, whilst keeping it\nvivid enough to feel every\nemotional blow. Staging\nthe party almost entirely\nin two rooms keeps the\ntension ratcheted up, and\nthere\u2019s no flab at all. And\nbest of all, a cute fox\nnamed Cherry makes an\nappearance.\nAll in all, The Party is\na fantastic little picture, a\nblack comedy filled with\nsharp twists and delightful\nlines. With insights into\nrelationships, friendships\nand politics, and ranging\nfrom riotous to shocking,\nthis film is definitely worth\na watch.\nCome and write for Felix!\nFelix is looking for fresh blood! Whether you\u2019re a writer, illustrator, photographer, grammar boff, or a computer wiz, we want to hear from you! Email felix@ic.ac.uk if you\u2019re\ninterested in getting involved\n\u201cThe Party\nis filled with\ntension from\nthe get-go,\npitching\ncharacters\nagainst each\nother\u201d\nAs the cynic, April gets\nthe best lines of the bunch,\nbrushing off Martha as \u201ca\nfirst-class lesbian but a\nsecond-rate thinker\u201d. The\nclashes between her and\nthe maddeningly-eccentric\nGottfried are the funniest\nin the film, and burst out in\nalmost every scene.

The\nvast majority also knew\nwhat was expected of\nthem in their role. Safety\nwas singled out as an area\nImperial did particularly\nwell in, with the majority\nfeeling their department\nensured they were safe in\nthe workplace.\nThe majority of staff\nfelt proud to work for the\nCollege, and 80% felt a\nsense of personal accom-plishment.\nHowever, while the data\nseem to show that people\nwere generally satisfied\nwith their departments,\nthey revealed that few\nstaff thought that there\nwas enough collaboration.\nOnly 34% of staff agreed\nthat there was \u2018effective\ncollaboration between\nDepartments that work\nwithin my Faculty\u2019. Of the\nfour main Faculties, the\nFaculty of Natural Sciences scored the worst on this\nquestion, with only 30%\nof staff seeing evidence of\neffective collaboration.\nWithin departments,\nthere was evidence of\nincreased collaboration,\nwith 56% agreeing there\nwas effective collaboration between teams within\na department. However,\nsome sectors scored\npoorly, with the Departments of Aeronautical\nEngineering, Civil Engineering, and the Centre for\nEnvironmental Policy all\nreporting scores of under\n50%.\nDepartmental Breakdown\nA number of departments did particularly\npoorly in the survey: the\nDepartment of Aeronautics, in particular, stood\nout for its low scores, with\n53 out of 58 questions\ngarnering a below-average\nresponse. Aeronautics\nstaff were among those to\nhave the worst opinion of\ntheir own Departments,\ntheir Faculty, and senior\nleadership as a whole.\nFewer than half the staff\nsurveyed felt that they had\nenough resources to do\ntheir job, while only 29%\nfelt that their contributions\nto the College were valued\nand recognised.\nThe Department of\nComputing also scored\npoorly, with 50 questions below the Imperial\naverage. It was the department with the least positive opinions of College\nsenior leadership, and\nstaff were among those\nleast likely to feel valued\nat College: only 37% felt\nthat their pay was fair, and\nunder half thought that\ntheir contributions were\nvalued. A number of staff\nfelt Imperial did not care\nabout their welfare, with\nonly 31% agreeing that the\nCollege cared about their\nhealth and wellbeing.\nThe results obtained\nfrom Imperial College\nUnion staff, half of whom\ncompleted the survey,\nseemed to reveal a sense of\nfeeling under-recognised,\nwith only 39% feeling\nthat their work was recognised as a contribution\nto College. Union staff\nalso had among the lowest\nopinions of the College\nwe are an independent-ly-led organisation distinct from College, with\nour own strategic plan,\nmanagement structure\nand Board of Trustees,\u201d\nwhich \u201cexplains why\nthey are less likely to\nconsider themselves to be\ncontributing to College\u2019s\nstrategy.\u201d\nThe representative reported that the Union runs\ntheir own staff satisfaction\nsurvey every year, which\nfound that 96% felt they\nunderstood the Union\u2019s\nvalues, and 93% felt proud\nto work for ICU. They also\npointed out that \u201cregarding\nquestions that are applicable to both College and\nICU staff members, we are\nproud of our results [and]\nour scores are consistently\nat least 10% higher than\nCollege overall in some\nareas\nOther departments\nthat did not feel a strong\nsense of belonging to\nthe College included the\nDepartments of Medicine\nand Life Sciences, with a\nminority of staff feeling\na sense of belonging. In\nboth these departments,\nless than half the staff felt\nthey had enough resources\nto complete their work,\nand they scored poorly\nin their opinions of their\nrespective Faculties.\nWomen working in the\nLife Science Department,\nin particular, were less satisfied with College leadership and line management,\nand were less clear about\ntheir department\u2019s goals.\nFor some departments,\nthe survey reflected well\n\u2013 the Grantham Institute,\nImperial\u2019s research hub\nfor climate change and\nthe environment, scored\nparticularly highly across\na number of questions.\nThe Dyson School for\nDesign Engineering and\nthe Department of Earth\nScience Engineering also\ntended to score highly.\nAll departments have\nnow completed \u2018Action\nPlans\u2019 to address the\nresults of the survey.\nAmong the lowest scoring\ndepartments, there is an\nemphasis on increasing\ncommunication within\ndepartments and with\nCollege leadership. The\nDepartments of Aeronautical Engineering and\nMedicine both suggest\nincreasing staff input\non their Management\nCommittees, while the\nDepartment of Computing\nstates it will \u201cprovide\nforums for discussion on a\ntermly basis\u201d. Harassment\nand bullying will also be\naddressed, with an emphasis on \u201cActive Bystander\u201d\ntraining and encouraging\nstaff to feel confident in\nexpressing concerns.\nA College\nrepresentative told Felix:\n\u201cthe College level results\nand action plan are being\ndiscussed this Friday at\nProvost\u2019s Board \u2013 one of\nthe College\u2019s most senior\nmanagement boards \u2013 with\nupdates to the community\nthrough Staff Briefing\nlater this term.\u201d\nHowever, among the\ndepartments scoring\nlowest in the survey, there\nseemed to be a general\nfeeling that things would\nstay the same. Overall,\n53% of staff felt that action\nwould be taken following\nthe survey; however, in the\nDepartment of Aeronautics and the Union, only\na third of staff surveyed\nfelt confident that things\nwould change, and fewer\nthan half those surveyed\nin the Departments of\nMedicine and Computing\nhad faith that action would\nbe taken.\nBullying, Harassment,\nand Equality\nOne of the most sensitive questions in the survey\nasked respondents whether\nthey had experienced bullying or harassment during\nthe last twelve months at\nImperial. Overall, only\n81% of staff were able to\ndeny they had experienced\nany such harassment or\nbullying, which places\nImperial 15th out of 18 in\na benchmark comparison\nwith other universities\nsurveyed.\nThis is an increase on\nthe last two iterations of\nthe survey: in 2014, when\nasked about harassment\nor bullying, 86% of staff\nwere able to confirm they\nhad experienced neither\nwithin the last three years.\nSeveral departments\nscored concerningly high\non the question: in the Department of Aeronautical\nEngineering, the Centre\nfor Environmental Policy,\nand the Dyson School of\nDesign Engineering, 14%\nof staff said that they had\nbeen bullied or harassed\nwithin the last year. For\nthe Department of Earth\nScience and Engineering,\nand College\u2019s ICT de-partment, the proportion\nwas 13%. In the majority\nof cases, the bullying or\nharassment appears to\nhave been carried out by a\ncolleague, the individual\u2019s\nline manager, or another\nmanager within their de-partment.\nCollege policy states\n\u201charassment, bullying,\nand/or victimisation is\nunacceptable,\u201d and says\n\u201cline managers have an\nobligation to tackle harassment\u201d.\nAnother possibly controversial question asked\nrespondents whether\nthey believed \u2018career\nprogression is fair within\nImperial (regardless\nof ethnic background,\ngender, religion, sexual\norientation, disability or\nage)\u2019. In total, 58% of\nstaff agreed that career\nprogression was fair, but\nsome departments reported lower scores: less than\nhalf of ICT staff, and 52%\nof staff in the Department\nof Bioengineering, ESE,\nand Dyson School, felt\nprogression was fair.\nWomen were less likely\nthan men to feel career\nprogression was fair, and\nwere less likely to know\nwhat career progression\nopportunities were availa-ble. Imperial College was\nalso a founder member of\ntheAthena SWAN Charter,\nwhich was established to\n\u201cencourage and recognise\ncommitment to advancing\nthe careers of women in\nSTEM employment\u201d. On\ntheir website, Imperial\nmake it clear that, as a\npublic body, they have a\nlegal duty to ensure they\ntake appropriate action to\n\u201cadvance quality of opportunity\u201d for all staff.\nThe numbers reflect\na decline since the last\nsurvey, which asked\nwhether staff feel they\nhad the opportunity for\nprogression regardless\nof age, gender etc. In the\nlast iteration, 85% of staff\nagreed that they had fair\nopportunities for career\nprogression, against a UK\naverage of 63%.\nComparison\nA College representative emphasised that while\n\u201cThe Staff Survey is an\nimportant tool to hear the\nviews of colleagues across\nourcampuses\u201d,thatit\u201calso\nallows us to benchmark\nourselves against similar\ninstitutions.\u201d Imperial\ndid well compared to UK\nuniversity benchmark\nmeasurements, with 14\nquestions five percentage\npoints or more above the\nbenchmark, and only one\nquestion below. However,\na number of scores have\ndecreased since the last\nsurvey: out of the 20 questions that could be compared to the 2014 survey,\nonly one had increased,\nand ten had lower scores.\nIn a statement, a\nCollege representative\nsaid: \u201cThe talents of Imperial\u2019s staff community are\nour greatest strength, and\ncentral to the College\u2019s\nmission. We know that\nif we are to continue to\nattract and retain the very\nbest staff, we must provide\na supportive working\nenvironment. The College\nStrategy makes clear how\nwe do that.\u201cWhile we\u2019re\npleased to see that 87%\nof staff are proud to work\nat Imperial, and to have\noutperformed the sector\ngenerally, it\u2019s clear that\nthere is more still to do,\nand we are determined to\ncontinue to improve.\u201d\n\u201cIn the\nDepartment of\nAeronautics,\nonly a third of\nstaff thought\naction would\nbe taken after\nthe survey\u201d\nsenior leadership.\nIn a statement to Felix,\na Union representative\nstated that while the Union\nparticipates in the survey,\n\u201cit is important to note that\nStaff survey reveals poor opinion of College leaders\nCont.\nA\ncomplaint with\nthe Union was\nraised related\nto last week\u2019s\nAutumn Elections, when\nit was discovered a mailing list had been used\nto promote one of the\ncandidates.\nAn email was sent\nout from the Chemical\nEngineering Society\u2019s\nOpinion split over Union\u2019s election invstigation\nmailing list, by a member\nof their executive, shortly\nafter 6pm on the evening\nof Thursday 17th October\n\u2013 roughly 18 hours before\nvoting closed. The email\nasked recipients to vote\nfor one of the students\nrunning for the Faculty of\nEngineering (Undergrad-uate) Ordinary Member\nof Council. It was sent\nto 1228 members of\nChemEng Soc, of whom\nit is estimated 8-900 were\neligible to vote for the\nposition. It was not sent\nwith the knowledge of\nthe candidate in question,\nor the Chairman of ChemEngSoc, Kieran Naylor.\nThe position was one of\nthe most highly-contested\nin the elections, with 16\ncandidates running for\nfour positions at the time\nvoting closed. In total,\nover 900 people voted for\nthis particular position,\nwith the candidate in\nquestion topping the polls,\nmore than 50 votes ahead\nof their nearest rival.\nA complaint was raised\nover the weekend of the\n21st/22nd by a Union\nCouncil member who\nwas alerted to the email.\nThe complaint was raised\nafter the close of voting;\nthe Union\u2019s regulations\nfor the Autumn Elections\nstate that \u201call complaints\nmust be received within\ntwo hours of the close of\nthe voting period.\u201d\nA Union spokesperson\ntold Felix: \u201cDemocracy\nis one of our fundamental values, and we\nimmediately investigated\nwhether this rule breach\nwould require further\naction to ensure our\ndemocratic integrity\u201d.\nThey stated that the Union\ndecided that \u201cas previous\nsimilar incidents have not\nrequired disqualifications\nor caused election to be\ncancelled, it was not proportionate for us to rerun\nthis election.\u201d\nThe Union\u2019s response\nseems to have divided\nthose students heavi-ly-involved with student\nrepresentation: Naylor\ndescribed the investigation the Union conducted\nas \u201cappropriate\u201d, saying\nthat \u201cin general, I believe\nthat this issue has been\nblown way out of proportion through poor\ncommunication.\u201d\nHowever, one student\ntold Felix that \u201cas a fellow\ncandidate\u201d, they were\n\u201cdisgusted that the Union\nwill not be pursuing an investigation or disciplinary\naction\u201d. Another student\nsaid \u201cThe Union failing to\ntake a harder line on this\ndemonstrates they only\ncare about democracy\nwhen it\u2019s convenient for\nthem.\u201d\nNaylor told Felix\n\u201cThe ChemEng Soc, and\nmyself, believe that the\nintegrity of the elections\nmust be upheld by all\nparties. We should always\nendeavor to make sure\nall candidates have an\nequal platform regardless\nof access to mailing lists,\nsocial media platforms or\nother mass media.\u201d\nHe went on to describe\nthe candidate as \u201cincredibly well-respected,\npopular, and well-liked\u201d,\nand expressed his confidence that they would\nhave won the election\nwith or without the use\nof the mailing list, stating\nthat \u2013 while Chemical Engineering is one of the departments with the highest\nturnouts \u2013 he believed that\nthe majority of students\nwho would have received\nthe email voted before it\nwas sent.\nThe Union stated that\nthey \u201cwill follow this up\nwith the individual con-cerned, who has offered\ntheir apologies, to emphasise that this behaviour\nmust not be repeated.\u201d\nNEWS\nThe Union\u2019s decision\nafter a complaint was\nraised over a mailing\nlist has divided\nopinion of student\nrepresentatives.\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n"

So\nyou combine these 3 materials and you could get\ncompletely new or novel\nfeatures.\u201d\nSo how does one go\nabout creating a material\nfrom scratch? \u201cTo me\nit\u2019s like you are in a very\nsunny place, like a sunny\nSpain or sunny Malaga,\nand you look up at the sky\nand there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d\nsays Santos. \u201cI got the idea\nand then the theory and\n\u201cAs well as\nmaking more\ndurable\nscreens, the\nmaterial could\nallow smart\ndevices to\nbecome solar\npowered\u201d\n\u201cWhen\nmight this\nmaterial reach\nsmartphones?\nElton Santos\nreckons it\u2019s not\ntoo far away\u201d\nthen did simulations. After\nseveral months those simulations worked well so\nthen I suggested to a few\ncolleagues in Berkeley\nand Stanford to try to\nmake it and they did \u2013 that\nsimple!\u201d\n\u201cOne of the applications that people got\nvery excited about was\nessentially to try to replace\nsome of the components\nyou have in the iPhone,\nfor instance,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cIn several of the iPhones\nthey use different kinds of\nglass, kinds of sapphire\nglasses, or other kinds of\npolymers. Those polymers\nor those glasses are expensive and very fragile\nbut if you replaced some\nof those components, and\nthen include the material,\nyou could get so many\nfeatures and one of those\nis unbreakable screens.\u201d\nAs well as making\nmore durable screens, the\nnew material could allow\nsmartphones and smart\ndevices to become solar\npowered and therefore\nrechargeable on the go.\n\u201cWe thought let\u2019s create\na material that harvests\nenergy and solar electricity and then you can\njust charge your battery\nwhile you just drink your\nbeer in Piccadilly,\u201d says\nSantos. \u201cYou can catalyse\nthe electric current in the\nbattery so you connect\nthe screen to the battery.\nI know prototypes in the\nmarket with different materials that are doing that.\nSo it\u2019s not far away from\nreality at the moment.\u201d\nHowever one potential\nproblem with a widespread use of graphene and\ngraphene-based materials\nis possible effects on our\nhealth. Only discovered\nin 2004, the toxicity of\ngraphene is still under\ninvestigation.\n\u201cPotentially it could\nbe harmful,\u201d explains\ngraphene expert Professor\nOwen Guy, Director of\nthe Centre for Nanohealth\nat Swansea University\u2019s\nCollege of Engineering.\n\u201cTypes of graphene which\nare particulate could potentially get into the body\nmore easily, and there is\nthe possibility there could\nbe toxic as with carbon nanotubes but I think there\u2019s\nprobably not enough data\nor enough studies on that\nyet.\u201d\nIn terms of environmental impacts, using\ngraphene on a large scale\nshould be safe. \u201cYou know\ngraphene\u2019s organic,\u201d notes\nSantos, \u201cit\u2019s a carbon\nmaterial, so I would say\nessentially it\u2019s environmentally friendly.\u201d\nWhilst the new material\nhas huge potential, it still\nneeds tweaking before it\ncan be put into use as it\nlacks an essential feature\nknown as the band gap.\nThe band gap is needed\nto give electronics like\nsmartphones an on-off\nswitching function.\n\u201cGraphene is what they\ncall a 0 band gap semiconductor,\u201d explains Guy. \u201cIn\na normal semiconductor\nyou have what they call\na band gap between the\nvalence band, the band\nwhich contains electrons,\nand the conductor band,\nthe empty band. In order\nto get conduction you\nhave to have either a hole\nor electrons and they\nhave to be able to flow.\nIn pure pristine graphene\nthere is no gap between\nthe valence band and the\nconduction band but when\nyou modify it in some way\nthen you can introduce a\nband gap.\u201d\nSantos and his team are\nalready working on potential solutions. \u201cThe idea\nnow is trying to replace\ngraphene with other materials,\u201d he says, \u201cmaterials\nthat are still flat and still\n2D but with a band gap. So\nthere are several materials\nnow that we are looking\ninto like the transition\nmetal dichalcogenides.\u201d\nSo when might this new\nmaterial reach our smart-phones? Santos reckons\nits application isn\u2019t too\nfar away. \u201cIf you think\nin terms of time frame it\ncan easily take between\nfive to seven years,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cI think that it will\nnot take too long to use\nthis kind of prototype,\nthis new material that we\ndiscovered.\u201d\nWhen you go full Naomi Campbell // Flickr/Cory Doctorow\nNo more asking around for an iPhone charger // Flickr/Soluci\u00f3n Individual\n\n"

Some of the topics\ncovered include how many\nsurveys the student has\nof one to ten, and whether\nthey had suffered any\nrepetitive strain injury\nthrough filling out too\nmany surveys.\nHowever, there are also\nmore esoteric questions,\nsuch as \u201cCan a survey feel\npain?\u201d, \u201cDo answer boxes\nhave souls?\u201d, and \u201cIf a\nsurvey is in the forest, and\nnobody fills it in, has democracy been deepened?\u201d\nThe survey, which\nwent live last Wednesday, seems to have been\nwell-received: one student\nFelix spoke to said \u201cI was\nso outraged over being\ntold I was too wankered to\nuse the ski-slope at ACC\nnight this week, I was\nready to mail anthrax to\nthe Union reception.

Self-help books can provide us with invaluable advice about maintaining a balance.\nCOMMENT\nConnor Qiu\nComment Writer\nA\nt the world\u2019s\ntop academic\ninstitutions,\nthe pressure to\nachieve can be all-con-suming. Often I find\nmyself walking amongst\nhigh-flyers, questioning\nwhat drives this culture\nof self-sustaining com-petition. An innate drive\nemanates from these stu-dents, one that cannot be\ncontained. For those that\ncompare less favourably\nacademically, there is a\nfeeling of inadequacy that\nperpetually lurks in the\nback of the mind, casting\na shadow over what they\ndo. One imagines the\ntop of the class to be the\ncomplete opposite, but,\nsadly, candid accounts\nof student experiences\nsuggest otherwise.\nThe modern world has\nredefined what it means to\nbe a student. A good job\nmeans good food, decent\nhousing, and, perhaps,\nsome disposable income.\nGetting one requires\nmeticulous planning, but\njob security and longevity\nis no longer a certainty.\nSceptics will argue\nfind someone who would\ndisagree. According to a\nstudy carried out by New\nYork University in 2015,\nchronic stress that starts\nfrom secondary school\nand persists well into\nuniversity years is not\na rare finding amongst\nhigh-achieving students.\nIn a world that has\nbecome so interconnected\nvia technology, having\nthe confidence to be our\nown person is difficult.\nThe effect of social media\nand clickbait news is\nomnipresent. Perceptions\nare moulded and formed\nas quickly as information\nis transmitted from one\nscreen to another \u2013 at the\nspeed of light. The concept\nof self and knowing\noneself has never been\nmore challenging than\nbefore, but self-help books\ncater for all spectrums of\nsituations and problems.\nTherein lies their magic.\nSelf-help books intend\nto help their readership\nlive better lives by offering\npractical solutions and\nadvice to a wide variety of\nhuman problems from the\nprofessional to the very\npersonal. I discovered this\ngenre out of curiosity in a\nchance encounter whilst\nbrowsing an independent\nbookstore, and have been\nan avid reader of their\nbe comforting in difficult\ntimes, their spirit to be\nan indispensable guiding\nlight and their optimism\nto be the very definition of\npositive energy.\nI believe self-help books\ncan play a fundamental\nrole in re-establishing the\nprinciples that make self,\nself. There are tips galore\nabout how to live our lives\n\u2013 outlets like BuzzFeed\nare a favourite present-day\nsource \u2013 but there is\nsomething irreplaceable\nabout the semi-academic\nrigour of a good self-help\nbook. They bring a deeper\nand more substantial\nperspective, one that\nallows reflection upon\ncurrent life practices, in a\nmanner which is decidedly\nnon-judgemental.\nOf course, there will be\nthose who are sceptical.\nDetractors might claim\nthat self-help book content\nis all common sense and\nnothing special; some\nwill claim that real world\nexperience is the only way\nto learn, and that loading\nup on theory will never be\nthe solution. Whilst there\nis something to be said\nfor all the numerous coun-ter-arguments, they all\nreveal a level of cynicism\nthat cannot be healthy.\nBut there are many self-help books \u2013 where should\none start? Of course, the\nbest-sellersandthe\u2018classic\ntexts\u2019 come highly recom-mended, but the truth is\nthe starting point is not\nof huge significance. Two\ncontemporary volumes\nthat are easily accessible\nand offer actionable steps\nare Designing your Life\nby Bill Burnett and Dave\nEvans, and How to Have\na Good Day by Caroline\nWebb. These books will\nintroduce some of the most\npertinent and relevant\nself-help thought leadership \u2013 the recognised\ncutting-edge thinking in\nthe field of study. Expect\nanswers to your failing war\nwith procrastination and to\nyour currently unknown\nlife purpose. From here,\nyou might choose to\nengage in further study\nwith more academic texts,\nand maybe even go on to\ndevelop a passion for the\ngenre. When acquainted\nwith the literature, there\nwill be similar themes\nthat emerge, and some\nwill appear to \u2018repeat\u2019\nthe same principles. The\nreason for this is clear:\nthere are a few principles\nthat work, but they can be\nrather challenging, nigh\nimpossible, to execute\nHelp yourself to some reading... // Flickr/Thanakrit Gu\n\u201cThe modern\nworld has\nredefined what\nit means to be\na student\u201d\nFinishing the night in Heaven: inclusive,\ninappropriate, or irresponsible?\nIs ICSMSU\u2019s decision to return to an LGBT+ venue as the after-party for its freshers\u2019 pub crawl\nwell intentioned or inherently problematic?\nCOMMENT\nAnonymous\nComment Writer\nT\nhe question, \u201cIs\nit ever acceptable for straight\npeople in large\ngroups to congregate in\nan LGBT+ space?\u201d is a\ncontentious issue, and \u2013 in\nrecent media \u2013 a divisive\none. I\u2019d like to make\nmy position perfectly\nclear: there is something\nincredibly special about\ngay venues; something\nwhich, I believe, should\nbe respected and protected\nby all.\nThis may be mistaken\nas \u2018heterophobia\u2019 by disgruntled straight people\nwho are not used to being\nroutinely discriminated\nagainst for their sexuality\nor gender identity. But\nit is failure to recognise\nthis privilege which\nleads to ignorance about\nthe reason these venues\nexist: they provide a\nhaven for LGBT+ people\nto surround ourselves\nwith like-minded people\nand express ourselves,\naway from the oppressive\nsociety where we feel we\ncan\u2019t. They are places\nwhere heteronormativity\nis not the norm, and we are\nno longer the minority.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong,\nequality for LGBT+\npeople has come a long\nway since the brave days\nof the Stonewall riots. The\nidea that LGBT+ people\ncan go anywhere without\nfear of discrimination\nmeans that there are fewer\nand fewer LGBT+ spaces\nremaining. This lack\nmakes it even more important to respect them for\nwhat they are: gay spaces\n\u2013 for gay people.\nOf course, this is not\nto say straight people\nshould be refused entry\nto all gay venues, or that\nstraight people should\nnot accompany their gay\nfriends to such venues.\nIt does, however, require\nstraight people to reflect\nvenues in the country \u2013 a\nfact which, incidentally,\nis not mentioned on the\nICSMSU-generated event\npage. If the whole medical\nstudent body were re-spectful, clued-up allies it\nwould be possible to argue\nthat this influx would not\nthreaten the safe space.\nHowever, given that our\nown Union venues are\nunable to provide a similar\nhaven of safety for LGBT+\nstudents \u2013 something\nevidenced by the ordeal\nfaced by a non-binary\nstudent in the Reynolds\nbar last year, who was\nnearly forcibly-removed\nfrom the women\u2019s bath-room,despite union venues\nclaiming a zero-tolerance\nnumbers \u2013 the quantity of\ndrunk medics will so far\noutnumber any LGBT+\npeople, that the respect\nfor why the venue exists\nwould be lost. ICSM\nseems only to be furthering the fetishisation of\nLGBT+ issues, something\nwhich is seen year on year\nby the masses of straight\npeople donning glitter\nand celebrating Pride with\nvery little appreciation for\nwhat it really means.\nLGBT+ spaces are\nfantastic and should be\ncelebrated, but they are\nalso not a zoo or a novelty\nfor freshers to marvel\nat \u2013 and they should not\nbe used to purport an\nideal of progressiveness\nwithout real change or\nsupport. It is admirable\nthat ICSMSU would want\nto pledge their support for\nLGBT+ people and issues\nby supporting Heaven as\na venue; however it does\nbeg the question if their\nefforts might be better\nspent evaluating their own\ncommunity.\nThe LGBT+ medicine\nproject last year raised\nthe fact that there was no\nformal teaching about\nLGBT+ issues in the\nentirety of the 6 years of\nthe medicine curriculum \u2013\nmany early years teaching\nwas actively outdated.\nFurthermore, there is currently no LGBT+ officer\nin the ICSMSU commit-tee, nor are there events\nfor LGBT freshers or even\nolder years \u2013 just saying.\nIt may be uncomfortable to hear, but inclusivity\nand supportiveness does\nnot give you the right\nto monopolise the safe\nspaces of a minority group.\nAlthough we like to think\nwe live in a society with\ntrue equality, we are not\nthere yet \u2013 and we cannot\nbe complacent.\nWe would have gone to Heaven to take photos, but that wouldn\u2019t have been very respectful // Creative Commons\n\u201cWe need to\nrespect LGBT+\nclubs like\nHeaven for\nwhat they are:\ngay spaces, for\ngay people\u201d\nstance to discrimination in\nall its forms \u2013 it is difficult\nto argue this is the case..\nFurthermore, it seems\n\u2013 if only in terms of sheer\non their presence in these\nspaces. Just because one is\nallowed to do something\ndoes not mean morally\nit is the right thing to do,\nand by bringing large\ngroups of straight people\nto LGBT+ venues, the\npurpose of such venues\nis lost. It undermines\nthis respect for LGBT+\npatrons who frequent them\nsimply to feel safe and be\nthemselves.\nIt is this point which\nbrings me to ICSMSU\u2019s\nchoice to return to Heaven,\nthe popular gay nightclub,\nas its venue for their\nannual fresher\u2019s pub crawl.\nHeaven is a cracking\nvenue, and is thought to\nbe one of the largest gay\n\u201cInclusivity\nand being\nsupportive\ndoes not give\nyou the right\nto monopolise\nthe safe spaces\nof a minority\ngroup\u201d\nstudent resilience and determination has decreased\ncompared to previous\ngenerations. Whatever\nthe reason, today levels\nof stress and anxiety are\nhigh, and it is difficult to\n\u201cSuch books\nbring a deeper\nperspective,\none that allows\nreflection on\nlife\u201d\nflawlessly. It is important\nto emphasise that the real\nvalue of these books is\nunlocked by appreciating\ntheir interdisciplinary\nnuances and working out\nhow they apply to you.\nNonetheless, reading a\nself-help book provides an\nopportunity for a fair and\nkind evaluation of oneself.\nIt allows us to improve in\nour own mind\u2019s eye, to\nbe kind to ourselves. By\nbecoming more assured in\noneself and living off the\ncan-do-anything \u2018growth\nmindset\u2019 high that these\nbooks imbue, self-help\nbooks and the modern-day\nstudent are a perfect com-bination. Perhaps reading\nthem should be made a\nmandatory course require-ment.\n\u201cSelf-help\nbooks offer\npractical\nsolutions to a\nwide range of\nproblems\u201d\nvolumes ever since. In\nsubsequent years, after my\ndiscovery of this uniquely\npersonal genre, I have\nfound their contents to\n\n"
