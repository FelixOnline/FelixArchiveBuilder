    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 27 January 2005\nFILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\n23\nSince the success of Spiderman in\n2002, comic book characters have\nbeen waiting in line for the chance\nto leave their pages to seek out\nfiner things on the big screen, but\nfinally it\u2019s a chick\u2019s turn to kick ass!\nElektra is back, and this time she\u2019s\ngoing solo.\nWe last saw Elektra at the end\nof Daredevil (2003) where she dies\nin the arms of blind lawyer Matt\nMurdock. Having lived a tragic life,\nElektra (Jennifer Garner) is resurrected by a martial arts master who\nleads the side of good against the\nevil forces of \u2018The Hand\u2019.\nHaunted by her past and enraged\nby the brutal murder of her mother,\nnot even her sensei\u2019s strict training\nand discipline can quench Elektra\u2019s\nraging thirst for vengeance. Given\nthe ability to see shadows of the\nfuture, she is more powerful than\never. She becomes an assassin for\nshe has no reason to live, only to\nkill.\nHer latest targets are in the form\nof a 13 year old girl, Abby (Kirsten\nProut) and her father Mark (Goran\nVisnjic). However, what she sees in\nAbby reminds her of herself and the\ntwo form a bond. Having not done\nthe job she was sent to do, Elektra\ndedicates herself to protecting her\nnew friends from other trained kill-ers, some of which possess evil\nsupernatural powers.\nGarner does a brilliant job as the\nbeautiful yet deadly killer. She looks\nthe part and is a dedicated actress\nwho carries the film. Let\u2019s face it,\nthere have been countless films\nwhere children have grown up to\navenge the death of a loved one, but\nfor some reason (possibly the outfit)\nElektra stands out for me.\nStrangely, I grew quite fond of\n\u2018The Hand\u2019 and their deadly array\nof assassins, one of whom spread\ndisease and death through touch\nwhilst one of the others bore tattoos which came to life. Novel ideas\nindeed. They worked well in the film.\nUnfortunately, they were not utilised\nenough in terms of screen time,\nmuch to my disappointment.\nElektra is pleasing to the eye in\nmore ways than just one \u2013 not just\nGarner, but the film as a whole. The\nlush forest green settings in the\nmajority of the film are a refreshing\nchange from the cold rooftops of\nNew York City.\nThe action scenes are relatively\nshort and fewer in number than\nexpected. However, those that are\nincluded are satisfying to watch and\nwell choreographed.\nAlthough Elektra possesses these\npositive things, I feel the movie\nlacked flow since her shadowed past\nkept disrupting the rest of the film\nin the form of annoying flashbacks.\nNecessary as they are, I see no\njustification to include that many.\nAnother contributing factor to letting the film down was the brief\nyet confusing love story between\nElektra and Mark. I never really\ncaught on to the point or relevance.\nI left the cinema in a sense of bewil-derment, as I am sure you will too if\nyou watch this.\nHowever, don\u2019t think for a second\nI\u2019m discouraging you from going to\nsee it. On the contrary, go, and check\nit out for yourself.\nIt\u2019s a rare treat for the ladies to see\na female kick ass, and the lads will\nlove it since Garner looks amazing.\nJust don\u2019t expect non-stop action. I\nrecommend you don\u2019t all go running\nto the cinema in excitement. Just\nwalk. Stephen P Smith\nElektra-fyingly good?\nFrom the creators of X-Men and Spiderman comes the newest comic book adaptation.\nHow does it fare?\nElektra\nDirector: Rob Bowan\nStarring: Jennifer Garner, Goran\nVisnjic, Kristen Prout, Terence Stamp\nLength: 97 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nHHHII\nOne lass you don\u2019t wanna mess with\nA very long French film\nManech (Gaspard Ulliel) is not dead.\nManech is not dead, for if he was,\nMathilde (Audrey Tautou) would\nknow.\nBased on the novel by Sebastien\nJaprisot, director Jean-Pierre\nJeunet\u2019s A Very Long Engagement\nbrings out a realistic portrait of warfare set at the close of World War I.\nThe movie starts off with five French\nsoldiers who are sentenced to death\ndue to self-mutilation and are condemned to march out into no man\u2019s\nland.\nIt\u2019s 1920 and the war has ended.\nFor three years, Mathilde\u2019s beloved\nfianc\u00e9 Manech has been missing.\nShe refuses to accept the fact that\nManech died in early 1917 and still\nclings on to a thread of hope, with\nthe instinct that he is still alive. So\nshe begins an investigation, through\nletters, tracking down official documents and putting ads in newspa-pers. This starts her on a journey,\ntrying to find an answer to the mystery of her lost love by digging up\npieces of information that may lead\nto nothing more that a heartbreak.\nThe viewers are put through the\nviciousness of the war, heroism of\nordinary men, enduring passion,\nintuition and persistence of the\nhuman heart. The first hour of the\nmovie leaves you with a little confusion because of the many names of\nthose involved. Gradually though, a\npicture begins to emerge.\nAudrey Tatou continues to amaze\nthe viewers throughout the movie\nwith her sincerity and natural\nscreen presence. Her sadness is\nsometimes heartbreaking. However,\nthis movie is not only romantic\nbut violent. You find yourself being\ndrawn into the war scenes with each\nbomb blast, due to the vibrations of\nthe sound.\nThere are some very graphic\nscenes which include the image of a\nman covered with guts of a comrade\nand spitting some of them out of his\nmouth. Jeunet also adds, with perfect comic timing, the minor arguments between the postman and\nMathilde\u2019s uncle Sylvain.\nProductiondesignerAlineBonetto,\ncinematographer Bruno Delbonnel\nand costume designer Madeline\nFontaine effortlessly make everything feel fully formed and completely realized, especially the two major\nlandscapes, the trench (wasteland\nfull of blood and mud) and the peaceful country farm (full of warmth and\ncomfort of home). The colours of the\nimages in the movie are manipulated and are sometimes given an\nearthy look. What Jeunet really succeeds is in his amazing visionary of\nthe bittersweet but picture perfect\nrealistic finale that couldn\u2019t have\nended any better, with the voiceover narration relating the onscreen\naction flawlessly.\nAs beautiful, grand and entertaining as A Very Long Engagement\nwas, it was unnecessarily long. The\nmovie could have been cut down\nwith some tales, which hardly had\nanything to do with the mystery, left\nunsaid.\nVidula Vinayagamoorthy\nA Very Long Engagement\nDirector: Jean-Pierre Jeunet\nStarring: Audrey Tautou.

So I\u2019m not\nsurprised by the results.\u201d\nUsing information from 110\nautomatic monitoring points\nspread throughout the UK,\nexperts determined that\nSouth Kensington had the\nsecond highest level of nitrogen dioxide out of the areas\ntested. London\u2019s Marylebone\nRoad was highest with 108\nmicrograms per cubic metre.\nThe average from all UK stations was 32 micrograms.\nNitrogen dioxide reacts\ninstantaneously with water to\nform nitric acid. This means\nit is toxic to various animals\nas well as to humans, causing\nirritation in the eyes, throat,\nand on the skin.\nIn the long term, nitrogen dioxide exposure may\nalso increase an individual\u2019s\nsusceptibility to respiratory\ninfection and cause alterations in the lungs.

It is just a shame\nthat the second party is right\nwing, allowing Tony Blair to\npush further and further to\nthe right and steal the Tories\u2019\nthunder.\nIf the Liberal Democrats\nmanage to do what they think\nis possible and become the\nsecond party at this year\u2019s\nelection, they may manage\nto shame Blair into actually\nbehaving like the leader of\na Labour party. But while\nthe Tories are in opposition,\nthey must do everything\nthey can to win back seats,\nand in their wisdom they are\nswinging even further to the\nright. Whether this will appeal\nto many voters is question-able, but they are doing their\nbest.\nThis week, they caused an\nenormous storm by pulling\ninto debate the issue their\nsupporters feel so strongly\nabout: immigration.\nMichael Howard, Tory\nleader and the son of immi-grants, put a full page ad in\nThe Sunday Telegraph which\npromised that, if elected, the\nTories would impose a quota\non asylum seekers and introduce a points system for economic migrants. Cue much\nwailing and gnashing of teeth\nby the left wing papers.\nThe Mirror accuses the\nConservatives of desperation and reminds us that \u201cthe\nTories have a history of playing the \u2018race card\u2019.\u201d Howard\u2019s\npredecessor, William Hague,\ntook a similar lurch to the\nright shortly before the Tories\nwere thrashed at the polls\nfour years ago.\nThe Guardian reports\nTrevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for\nRacial Equality, accused\nthe Conservatives of planning their campaign around\n\u201cill-informed propaganda of\nsome of the more demented\nanti-immigration groups.\u201d\nBut The Mail, one of the\ncountry\u2019s most powerful\npapers, is in support of the\nmove: \u201cOur hospitality has\nbeen abused. Many asylum\napplicants are economic\nmigrants in disguise, playing the system to stay as\nlong as possible. Others just\nenter and work here illegally.\nMichael Howard, himself the\nproud son of Jewish immi-grants, deserves much credit\nfor courageously refusing to\naccept the orthodoxy of our\nsmug liberal elite who want\nto suppress real debate on\nthis issue.\u201d\nThe paper recommends\nrepealing the Human Rights\nAct, which, it said, has caused\ndamage by giving \u201ca green\nlight to asylum seekers\u201d.\nThe Independent has one of\nthe most thoughtful articles\non the topic, asking: \u201cWhy not\nuse this excellent model on\nour stretched public services\ntoo? Put a limit on how many\ninjured people will be admitted into hospitals.\u201d\nUnder Tory plans, The\nIndependent points out,\nKelly Holmes would never\nhave competed for Britain\nin the Olympics since her\nfather came to Britain in the\n1960s without the crucial job\nskills required for admission.\n\u201cThere are those who prefer\nto see the positive contribution played by new arrivals.\nBritain, they argue, would\nbe a much poorer place both\nculturally and economically\nshould Mr Howard\u2019s vision\nhave prevailed over the last\nthree generations. The losses\nwould be felt in the transport\nand health services, the arts,\nsport and, crucially, commerce.\u201d\nThe paper points out that \u2013\nunlike the stereotype of immigrants working in unskilled\njobs \u2013 three quarters have\nmanagerial or skilled professions and are sought out by\nthe Government.\nThis debate is not going to\ngo away. No matter how distasteful some of us may find\nit, it is important to many\nvoters and needs to be dis-cussed.

    "content": "A manual for saving the world\nAndya Primanda finds out how can we use the demise of historical civilisations to prevent our doom\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nHere is a book foretelling doom.\nIt warns us of a possible impending disaster, in which society would\nbreak down, governments would\nfall, and people would be pushed to\nthe limit and start killing and even\neating each other. In fact, all those\nevents had been the fate of some\nsocieties before ours, and we might\nbe on our way there.\nWritten in the analytical history style of his earlier work Guns,\nGerms and Steel, Jared Diamond\ngives an account of the successes\nand failures of several societies in\nfacing environmental crises that\nthreatened their means of surviving\nin Collapse. Easter Islanders, the\nMayan civilization, the Anasazi and\nthe Greenland Norse colony succumbed to those crises, while the\npeople of Tikopia, New Guinea high-landers, and Tokugawa-era Japan\nmanaged to make the right decisions\nand survived. Also highlighted are\nthe Malthusian tragedy that materialized in Rwanda in 1994, where\ntensions caused by overpopulation\nexploded into genocide; the contrast\nbetween deforested Haiti and green\nDominican Republic, neighbours on\nthe Caribbean island of Hispaniola\nwith differing governmental attitudes towards the environment;\nand the environmental problems of\nChina and Australia.\nHuman societies, past and\npresent, always have a major impact\non their environment. Some parts of\nthe world are more environmentally\nfragile than the others, and if the\npressure caused by human activities on any such region is too large,\nits life-sustaining ability would\nbreak down, as would the society that depends on it. Diamond\u2019s\nexamples show that some societies\nfailed to anticipate environmental\ncrises and continued with whatever\nthey had been doing for years, oblivious to the destruction they would\nbring until the consequences turned\nup. Sometimes the insulation of\nelites from problems encountered\nby commoners can end up in bad\ndecisions; like Easter Island chiefs\nthat kept on erecting statues and\nMayan kings bent on attacking each\nother, oblivious that their subjects\nwere suffering from environmental\nbreakdown. Today we have much\nmore impact on nature than those\npast societies, because of our larger\nnumbers and more intensive use\nof land and resources. Should we\nstart asking ourselves whether we\nmight be following their footsteps to\ndestruction?\nHowever, the book is not all about\nfailures. Several societies, like the\nTikopians and New Guinea high-landers, adopted a bottom-up\napproach, with individuals actively\ndoing things to ensure that they\ncould sustain the quality of their\nenvironment. Tokugawa, Japan and\nthe Dominican Republic used a different approach: top-down management where a centralized authority dictates effective environmental\nprotection measurements.\nSome might think that the collapsed societies just had the misfortune of being at the wrong place;\ntheir environments just unsuitable\nto support civilization. The case of\nsocieties that lived on Greenland\nwould dispel this argument. The\nGreenland Norse chose to live\nas farmers inkeeping with their\nEuropean identity, and perished\nbecause their choice was unsuitable in Greenland; while the Inuit\nmastered the appropriate survival\ntechniques and survived until today.\nThe environment might put pressure on the society, but the people\ncan decide what to do about it.\nEnvironmental activists sometimes point their fingers at big\nbusinesses as the main perpetrators of environmental destruction.\nDiamond offers his own experience of involvement with several\nbig extractive companies, and while\nsome are outright destructive, there\nare also big businesses that adopted\nrigorous conservation practices.\nThe companies realise that investing and practising conservation is\nprofitable in the long-term interest\nof their business: they would avoid\nthe potential costs of cleaning up\nafter accidents and have a more\nrespectable corporate image. The\npublic can influence businesses to\nbe more environmentally friendly\nby knowing where to exert their\npressure \u2013 campaigning against\nbuying the products of companies\nknown to harm the environment, for\nexample.\nCollapse reminds us to take the\nenvironmental and population\nproblems seriously if we want to\nbe survivors. Some reappraisal of\ncore values would also be necessary,\nbecause some societies made environmentally destructive decisions\nfor the sake of those values. Also,\nwith a globalized world, countries\nare becoming increasingly interde-pendent, and a collapse anywhere\nin the world would affect everyone.\nDiamond summarized twelve main\nenvironmental problems that we\nmust tackle if we want to survive:\ndestruction of natural habitats;\noverfishing; biodiversity loss; soil\nerosion; depletion of fossil fuels;\ndepletion of freshwater; exhaustion\nof global photosynthetic capacity;\ntoxic chemicals; alien species; global warming; population growth;\nand overconsumption (Imperial students from various disciplines might\nwant to pick one most familiar to\nthem and start doing something).\nIt is a Herculean task indeed, but\nJared Diamond describes his own\nstance as that of a \u2018cautious optimist\u2019, where he maintains hope that\nwe could pull ourselves through.\nThe reasons for his hope are that\nthese problems are not insoluble,\nand we can learn from the success\nand failure stories of earlier civiliza-tions. There is still hope to save the\nworld, and this book could be considered a manual of how to do so.\nCollapse: How societies\nchoose to fail or survive\nby Jared Diamond\n(Allen Lane, Hardcover)\nHHHHI\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 27 Januray 2005 21\n\n"

The Beagles are\nnot a College or Union club,\nand this is not a Union event,\nalthough many students usually attend.\nThe Union is not pro-hunt-ing, or anti-hunting for that\nmatter. Whichever view the\nUnion took on issues such as\nhunting, some of our members would disagree, and\nit wouldn\u2019t be fair to make\nsome students feel that they\ncouldn\u2019t support union events\nor use the services and representation that their union\noffers because they disagreed\nwith its political views. So we\nstay out of politics unless it\u2019s\nsomething student-related\nlike tuition fees.\nChoir visit\nThat weekend, 19-20\nFebruary, Imperial College\nChoir will be visiting Wye for\ntheir annual \u2018weekend away\u2019,\na chance to escape from\nLondon and concentrate on\nrehearsing, with some time\nfor socialising on Saturday\nnight.\nAny London-based students who would like to come\nshould contact Choir social\nsecretary Katherine Sloyan;\nany Wye-based student who\nwishes to join the choir\nfor their rehearsals that\nweekend, let me know (any\nSilwoodians, contact one of\nus and we\u2019ll see what we can\ndo\u2026). Any Wye-based students who want to meet some\nreal live South Kensington\nstudents on Saturday night,\nlook out for more details.\nOld boys\nThe weekend of 11 March\nwill provide a chance for\ncontinuing students to see\nsome old friends again, and\na chance for new students to\nmeet some former students\nand hear some amazing (and\nsometimes not-quite-believ-able) stories about \u201cthe old\ndays\u201d. It\u2019s Wye\u2019s famous \u2018old\nboys weekend\u2019.\nAs a result, the Easter\nDinner and Ball have been\nmoved forward a week, to\nFriday 4 March 2005. This has\nthe added advantage of the\nSwanley Hall at Withersdane\nbeing available for the ball,\nso hopefully our guest DJ\ncan finally use his whole light\nshow.\nSo, it may be cold and dark\nright now, but this term has\nplenty to look forward to.

So it was\nwith a sense of purpose that\nthe community of Silwood\nmobilised itself to contribute\nto the global relief operation.\nA combination of second\nhand book sale and international food night raised a\ncombined total in excess of\n\u00a3380 which has been given to\nthe UNICEF tsunami appeal,\na fantastic achievement to\nthose organising it bearing in\nmind there are only around 80\nstudents permanently living\non site.\nFor the international food\nnight, the global community\nwas well represented with\nover eighteen nations contributing to the feast, from the\nwell known and always appreciated Chinese, Indian and\nItalian to the less commonly\nfound Iranian, Caribbean and\nLuxemburgish (Petit Beurre,\nif you were wondering). It was\na firm demonstration that\nthe community at Silwood\nand the Imperial world as a\nwhole is a global metropo-lis. The home countries were\nwell represented too \u2013 there\nwere contributions from all\nfour parts of the UK, with\ntraditional Scottish Bonnie\nPrince Charlie Chicken and\nClapshot and Welsh Rarebit\n(fancy cheese on toast to the\nEnglish).\nAll was consumed in the\nsocial room, conveniently\nnext to the bar where the food\nwas washed down and spices\ncooled by drinks from our new\nfirst time father Dave the barman (congratulations Dave\nand Michelle). Huge congratulations have to be given to all\nthe chefs, in particular Bish,\nSaskia, Roshan, Niki and\nRob.

Tonight, the\nmenu had a Brazilian twist \u2013 namely\nan exclusive DJ Marky four hour\nset. Marky\u2019s epic sets have taken\non legendary status in his home city\nof Sao Paolo, but this was to be the\nUK\u2019s first taste of an extended session with the Brazilian deck-wizard.\nSet times have become a bone\nof contention in the drum & bass\nscene of late, with Andy C and the\nrest of the D\u2019n\u2019B premier league\nrequesting longer slots to showcase\ntheir music. However, club promoters remain reluctant, preferring to\nopt for safety in numbers, ie packing all the big names on one lineup to attract the maximum number\nof paying customers. This evening,\nMarky and friends had taken matters into their own hands.\nOur touchdown was slightly later\nthan anticipated, and it was immediately evident that it was going\nto be a busy night. The guestlist\nqueue was bursting at its seams,\nwhilst the regular line had wrapped\nitself around the full length of West\nCentral St. Once inside, drinks were\npurchased and a quick scan towards\nthe DJ booth revealed a familiar\nfigure at the controls \u2013 the Marky\nshowcase was already in effect.\nAs we hit the floor, we were greeted by the sublime sounds of MC\nConrad\u2019s Golden Girl, a tune that is\ndeservedly causing a storm on the\nscene at present. Soulful and heavy\nin equal measure, this was to epitomize Marky\u2019s four hour onslaught.\nDynamite MC was in full swing, running the show in his inimitable style.\nFresh from his recently released\nsolo album, the Reprazent front man\nhad raps to burn. Unfortunately we\nhad missed out on Giles Peterson\u2019s\nperformance, but the reports were\nhealthy. Meanwhile, Marky was\ncoming seriously correct with his\ntune selection. The longer set made\nfor a deep and diverse assortment\n\u2013 early highlights included a slice of\nCalibre\u2019s beautiful Hypnotize, a dollop of Die\u2019s funked out Jitta Bug and\na very rare outing for Roni\u2019s 1998\nanthem Breakbeat Tera.\nEven though his set was long fin-ished, Giles P could evidently not\nbear to tear himself away. Hanging\naround to share jokes with Dynamite\nand Marky whilst getting down with\nthe sounds, it was clear that the\nnight\u2019s title \u2018DJ Marky and friends\u2019\nwas not just a cynical marketing\nploy. The nice atmosphere was not\nrestricted to the DJ booth, and the\ntight laser displays illuminated\nsmiles and good feeling all around.\nAway from the main room, Bugz\nin the Attic were hosting the lounge\nand their broken beats provided a\nfitting respite from the high tempos elsewhere. Recently crowned\n\u2018Worldwide Winners of 2004\u2019 on Giles\nPeterson\u2019s Radio 1 show, one might\nhave expected this room to have\npacked out. In truth, however, it\nseemed the majority of the masses\nhad come for the man from Brazil.\nWhen Marky first burst onto the\nDJ circuit in this country, it was his\nwild scratching and cutting techniques that really caught people\u2019s\nattention. Back in the main room, we\nwere given an excellent reminder of\nwhat the fuss was about. Playing a\nrecord composed of nothing but a\ncontinuous tone, the Brazilian wonder proceeded to chop it to shreds\non the cross-fader, using the pitch\ncontrol to match it to the tune playing in the background. Dynamite\ncould do nothing but look on in awe\nas the entire crowd erupted.\nAs the set rolled on, things were\ngetting progressively nasty tune-wise. Needless to say, the heinous\nsub-section of Logistics\u2019 Together\nbust up the place and left the audience pleading for the rewind. Marky\nseemed to be relishing the extra\ntime, allowing him to build up a\nstructured performance through\nthe night.\nPerhaps the success of this event\nwill sway promoters towards longer\nset times on a regular basis. If not, it\nmight be time to start saving for that\nplane ticket to Sao Paolo.\nAnthony Roberts &\nJoseph Bull\nDJ Marky and friends\nDJ Marky (centre) and friends Dynamite MC (left) and Giles Peterson (right)\nDJ Marky and friends\nThe End\nHHHHI\nFile under:\nJazzy drum & bass, Liquid funk\nIf you like this, try:\nMovement @ Bar Rumba, Swerve\n@ The End\nThe wild crowd, DJ Marky and Dynamite MC show their appreciation for one another\n\n"

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEW\nMost of you have probably heard\nMixmaster Mike\u2019s work before, even\nif you have no idea who he is. As\nthe long term collaborator with the\nBeastie Boys, his DJing provided\nthe addictive beats for widespread\nhits such as Intergalactic, and the\nrecent screeching rhythm for the\nBeastie\u2019s latest album To The Five\nBoroughs. Also a stand-alone DJ,\nhere he presents his latest solo\nwork, Bangzilla.\nThe whole album is a nostalgic\nthrowback in two respects. First\nit takes the eighties approach to\nhip-hop (think earlier acts like\nM.A.R.R.S.), throwing together\nquickfire samples to create a jumpy\nbeat. And secondly, the album is\ncentred on a sci-fi theme, sampling\nold movies and news stories to create his unique warped audio comic\nstrip. Elements of B-movies, Star\nTrek and various tales of spacemen\nare all present, though unfortunately there\u2019s no Dr. Who.\nBeginning with Trigger Man, a\nchorus of violins and dodgy trumpets\nstraight out of any fifties sci-fi movie\nbreaks down into a moody beat complete with \u2018red alert\u2019 alarms, a rumbling bass line and Mike\u2019s traditional\nmanic scratching. From then on, the\nsamples come thick and fast. The\nmain mixes give a blend of trippy\nbeats and attention-grabbing bursts\nof quick screeching; they pierce the\nairwaves and demand your atten-tion, similar to the beat Mike used\nin the recent Beastie Boys hit, ChCheck It Out. You\u2019re always kept\non your toes due to the changing\nrhythms and samples, such as the\nsudden breakout into foreign pop on\nMarvel, or the conclusion to MJ-12\nStrike, when swirling violins provide\na backdrop to a shootout.\nThe strengths of the album, how-ever, also provide its weaknesses.\nAs it is essentially a quick fire sample album, there are several dulling moments where the continuing\nscratching and sample-changing\nstart to grate. In some places the\nalbum needs a bit more substance,\nperhaps requiring a leaf out of DJ\nShadow\u2019s book with an attempt\nat using the samples to create a\nmelody; or inviting in his old pals\nto provide some lyrics to go along\nwith the mix. It\u2019s a weakness that\nrarely occurs though, and you\u2019re left\nwith a mostly solid hip-hop album,\ndemanding constant attention until\nthe very last beat with its addictive\npace and unique sound structure.\nFinally, it\u2019s refreshing to see that\nin the age of sixth form poetry and\na polarised music industry, we can\nstill get an album that doesn\u2019t take\nitself too seriously. I mean \u2013 why\nelse would you call it Bangzilla?\nMatthew Hartfield\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 27 January 2005\n16\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBlunt in Brick Lane\nHe\u2019s supported Elton John as his first full band gig, fought in Kosovo,\nand dedicated songs about sex and drugs to his gran\nLIVE REVIEW\nMy brother said: \u201cYou\u2019ll know you\u2019re\nthere when someone approaches\nyou offering curry\u201d. It\u2019s almost a\npackage deal: curry and live music\non Brick Lane. But it wasn\u2019t the\ncurry that did it for me \u2013 singer-songwriter James Blunt is an awesome new talent and a really nice\nguy too.\nWe were there to interview James\nand to confirm he is every bit as\ngood live as his debut album Back\nTo Bedlam. On his sell-out band\nresidency at 93 Feet East (running\non three consecutive Wednesdays),\nJames modestly told us he has a\n\u2018big family\u2019, but it\u2019s not true. The\nvenue was packed, both with the\npublic school types he grew up with\nat Harrow School, and the usual diehard fans who scorn anyone who\ndare utter a word during the set\n(including me passing comment at\nJames\u2019s incredible voice!)\nDespite his enthusiasm for the\nsupport act, Luane Parle was little more than a Shania Twain tribute band; just not my cup of tea.\nBut it wasn\u2019t long until James, with\nhis drummer going mental in the\nbackground, let rip with new song\nDancing Days before introducing\nhimself and offering his services\nfor Bar Mitvahs and threesomes.\nThe set then started properly with\nbrilliant album opener and current\nsingle High.\nSadly the dodgy acoustics combined with much chat at the back\n(no, it wasn\u2019t me this time) let\nJames down during No Bravery, a\nsong written during and about his\ntime serving in Kosovo. (We asked\nto see the bullet-ridden guitar but it\nsuffered an unfortunate motorbike\naccident in front of the EMI bosses.)\nHowever, there was no stopping the\ncrowd joining in with So Long Jimmy\nand I got all excited with second new\nsong I Really Want You \u2013 I can barely wait for his new album. Saving\nthe best until last, James finished\nup with You\u2019re Beautiful, a truly\npretty song about an ex-girlfriend,\nfollowed by Wisemen, my personal\nfavourite. Then, all too soon, it was\nhome time.\nHe\u2019s been compared to Damien\nRice, Van Morrison, and Counting\nCrows; that\u2019s some list, but James\nBlunt deserves the association. His\nrather unconventional route into\nthe music industry is reflected in\nsome top-class lyrics which, combined with acoustic brilliance and an\namazing voice, leave me begging for\nmore. Watch out for Wisemen to be\nreleased on 7 March, but if, like me,\nyou can\u2019t wait, go out and get the\nalbum \u2013 it won\u2019t leave your stereo\nin a hurry.\nTo hear the interview, download\nthe 17 January NSUAOSATOC show\nfrom www.icradio.com.\nLucy Smith\nJames Blunt\n93 Feet East\nHHHHI\nJames Blunt: heartmeltingly good-looking. Damn him\nDoves\u2019 new\nsingle gets\na thorough\ngoing over;\nAmbulance\nLtd get\ntrashed\nSINGLE REVIEWS\nThose expecting another Pounding\nso to speak, be disappointed. Doves\nhave obviously realised that dance\nmusic is dead and now want to do\ntheir part in reminding people why\nit died.\nThe early nineties semi-Italian\nhouse piano is a nice touch but\nonly serves to irritate after a while.\nLuckily they try to over-shadow\nsuch an obvious mistake by putting\nin fuzz-laden guitars all over the\nplace alongside an up-tempo rock\nbeat. Of course, lead singer Jimi\ntries his hardest to cover it up with\nhis trademark Manc mope and at\ntimes the track feels compelling and\neven worthy of dancing to. But as\nyou begin to forgive the elements\nof mediocrity and lack of any significant idea to latch onto, a wimpy\nguitar solo makes an appearance.\nAnd when I mean wimpy, I mean\ntaken from the You Can Play Blues\nGuitar Too 3 handbook wimpy. Must\ntry harder! Matty Hoban\nYeah but why? Just why? There\u2019s\nno need. Ambulance Ltd are indie\nmade boring to the extreme. These\npale-faced bedwetters are afraid to\nmake their song Stay Where You\nAre do anything. I can\u2019t believe that\nsomeone would fund the release of\nthis. I mean, it\u2019s not offensive, it\u2019s\nnot really unpleasant, but it\u2019s not\nsomething that should have been\nreleased as a single. It consists of\none long verse.\nAmbulance Ltd will probably\nnext be seen supporting Embrace\nin your local pub when the world\nrealises what a mistake their latest\ncomeback was. Stay Where You Are\nis like one of those instrumental\nfiller tracks on albums by genius\npost-metal bands like Oceansize, or\nrecent Radiohead albums, that you\ncherish because the previous song\nmade your brain leak out of your\near. The previous song I listened\nto was the Fierce Girl single. And\nI still think this track is awful. Go\nfigure. James Millen\nDoves\nBlack And White Town\n(Heavenly)\nHHHII\nMix Master Mike\nBangzilla\n(Immortal)\nHHHHI\nThe Beastie Boys: I know it\u2019s not Mike, but they look so damn cool\nCh-ch-ch-check it out\nMixmaster Mike found fame as The Beastie Boys\u2019 resident DJ; on this,\nhis solo outing, he heads back to old school hiphop\nAmbulance Ltd\nStay Where You Are\n(Tvt)\nIIIII\n\n"

    "content": "Summer ball 2005\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 27 January 2005\n6\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nAn Irishman, a Scotsman and a Jamaican...\nI am glad to say that in this country the vast majority of people are\nhappy to live in a multi-ethnic com-munity. However, as always, there\nis a minority of people who believe\nthat this is wrong somehow and\nwe should all be the same. In some\nextreme cases, people believe we\nshould all look the same, talk the\nsame and think the same.\nIn the last couple of years there\nhas been a significant rise in support for far right political groups\nsuch as the BNP and the National\nFront. This is clearly very concerning for the future of our country and\nthe survival of our multi-cultural\ncommunities.\nThese groups, in some instances,\ncan target students in all sorts of\nways. For example, they may decide\nto come on to campus and try to\nrecruit members or just to stir up\nracial hatred.\nAside from this, you as a student\nmay experience racial abuse either\nat College, outside College or at\nwork, and it is important to know\nwhat you can do if this happens. It is\nalso good for you to know the types\nof racial abuse that can affect you in\nall walks of life.\nRacial discrimination\nIn the UK, the main law dealing\nwith racial discrimination is the\nRace Relations Act 1976, which\nwas recently amended by the Race\nRelations (Amendment) Act 2000.\nEuropean Union law (which the\nUK has also agreed to) includes a\nRace Directive which makes discrimination on grounds of racial or\nethnic origin unlawful in: employ-ment, training, education, access\nto social security and health care,\nsocial advantages, access to goods\nand services, and housing.\nWhat is racism?\nIt\u2019s not about white against black,\nor black against white. It\u2019s about\norigins, roots, religion, and not being\naccepted for who you are.\nA racist is someone who picks\non someone or treats them badly\nbecause they view them as different\nand unequal. Often, racists focus on\npeople who are visibly different, for\nexample, black or Asian people.\nRacism can also include prejudice against ethnic, cultural and\nnational differences. Irish travel-lers, Romanian asylum seekers,\ngypsies and eastern Europeans all\nexperience serious discrimination\nand racism. They are white but may\ndress in a distinct way, speak a different language or act differently in\na racist\u2019s eyes.\nSometimes, people who don\u2019t consider themselves prejudiced will\nmake fun of someone\u2019s accent or\nbirthplace. Although it is easy to\ngo along with a joke at someone\nelse\u2019s expense, this can make them\nfeel hurt and isolated. If you have\nto make someone feel small to get\na laugh, maybe you just aren\u2019t that\nfunny...\nAt College or at work\nIf you feel that you may be being\nracially abused or unfairly prejudiced against at College or at work,\nthere are a couple of options you\ncan take.\nFirstly, you can take it up with\nsomeone in your department, and\nthen, if you feel that you are not being\nlistened to, it may be an idea to seek\nfurther advice from the Information\n& Advice Centre, who can advocate\nfor you in such disputes. We are\nindependent of the College so would\nbe able to deal with the situation in\na more impartial way. You can also\nuse the Centre if you feel the same\nthing is happening to you at work.\nExtreme prejudice\nRacist attacks and violence are serious criminal offences and must be\nreported to the police. The Crime\nand Disorder Act 1998 created new\n\u2018racially aggravated offences\u2019, such\nas harassment, assault, grievous\nbodily harm, and criminal damag-es, which carry significantly higher\npenalties.\nIt is also a criminal offence under\nthe Public Order Act 1986 to use\nthreatening, abusive or insulting\nlanguage or behaviour in order to\nstir up racial hatred. This includes\ndistributing racist leaflets. All suspected criminal offences and any\nracist incidents should be reported\nto the police. The Information and\nAdvice Centre can also help you in\nthis situation and give you advice for\nreporting extreme case of prejudice\nto the police.\nDon\u2019t let your concern turn into\ncrisis. Make the Information and\nAdvice Centre your one stop shop\nfor all your welfare issues.\nTelephone: 020 7594 8067. Email:\nadvice@ic.ac.uk.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nSummer ball\nEveryone wants a great Collegewide summer ball. We need to make\nit appealing yet completely financially viable and accessible to as\nmany students as possible in terms\nof location, ticketing issues, and of\ncourse date.\nUnfortunately, departmental exam\ntimings vary so greatly, from the\nbeginning of term right until the\nend, so we\u2019re aiming for a date as\nclose to the end of the summer term\nas possible to avoid exams for as\nmany students as we can.\nWe are looking at various\noptions, such as holding the ball in\nCollege as we did two years ago,\ngoing for an external venue like last\nyear, or maybe combining it with\nthe Union\u2019s end of term carnival.\nOr maybe something completely\nnew...\nSo if you\u2019re interested in the challenge and fancy getting involved\nin making this year\u2019s summer ball\na success, or you just have some\nbright ideas and suggestions, get in\ntouch at dpfs@ic.ac.uk.\nClub and society events at\nthe Union\nWe\u2019re looking into new initiatives for\nents and want to work more closely\nwith clubs and societies. This initiative is a collaboration between the\nUnion and its members that allows\nyou to get involved in organizing\nents nights.\nContact your club officers if you\nhave an idea for a collaborative\nevent and then get in touch with\nme at dpfs@ic.ac.uk. We\u2019re making\nplans for the summer term now.\nOnline survey prize winners\nFrom all those of you who fully completed the online survey last term,\nhere are the winners:\nPlaystation: Altaf Daya.\nSTA Travel Voucher: Sapna\nNundloll.\nMeal for two at Moti Mahal:\nNicholas Oswald.\nCrate of beer (or soft drinks if\ndesired): Manish Hassani, Gareth\nClews and Tamara Elliot.\nWinners will be notified of how to\ncollect their prizes.\nMixed messages\nApologies for missing last week\u2019s\ncolumn. The observant amongst\nyou will have noticed that Union\nCouncil was a little lacking in its\nclarity of messages over the annual\nrent review. That meeting finished\nat 11.30pm the night before the rent\nreview meeting (and Felix\u2019s print\ndeadline). Sam Rorke, my Deputy\nPresident (Education & Welfare),\nand I spent much of the small hours\nand late morning preparing for the\nrent review meeting that afternoon\nand I just didn\u2019t get a chance to get\nmy column done.\nRent review\nFirstly I think with hindsight Sam\nand I could have tried to put the\nissues to Council in a less confusing\nway. We found ourselves having to\npiece together what the consensus\nof their opinion was. Confusingly\nCouncil had, as reported by Felix,\nvoted for option B (rents should\nvary according to ability to pay)\nbut then voted against the overall\noption. We thought this was partly\ndue to a misunderstanding of the\nsimilarity of options A and C (and\nthe correspondingly split vote).\nWe therefore decided that there\nwasn\u2019t enough strong support from\nCouncil for us to ask College to\nvary rents according to ability to\npay. We felt that a small majority of\nCouncil wanted all students to pay\nthe going rate for their room and\nbe empowered to make their own\nchoice about what type of room they\nwant and hence how much they\nare prepared to pay. Accordingly,\nsupport for students who can\u2019t afford\nhigher cost rooms should continue\nto come out of hardship and related funds, which should be better\npromoted.\nWhere we felt there was a strong\nsteer from Council was on addressing the unfairness that, at present,\nidentical rooms in halls that have\nbeen refurbished to a similar standard are sometimes charged at different rates. We were able to address\nthis at the Rector\u2019s Committee\non Student Residences and it was\nagreed that there should be some\nprice harmonisation.

Well done for noticing\nScummy! The team arrived\na massive two hours early for\nthe 11.30 kick-off.\nThings seemed to go from\nbad to worse when we realised our worst fears had\ncome true; it was the return\nof the Tank! Luckily small\nthings like unconsciousness,\nand not so small things,\nlike Tank, were not going to\nstand in the way of Wye making a crashing start to the\ngame.\nWye hit Kings with a multitude of tries in the first 15\nminutes, with notable running (like a pony) from fly\nhalf Gobby and outside centre\nBendy leaving the opposition\ntrailing in their wake.\nWe gave them a chance\nafter half time when a few\ntries slipped through the\ndefence, but then Wye powered forward again after\nwe took to heart some apt\nadvice from the opposition\u2019s\nscrum half: \u201cForward, run\nforward!\u201d\nIn the latter part of the second half, Wye again showed\nsuperlative skill with some\ngood backs moves orchestrated by Gobby and more\ngreat running from the\nwingers.\nSpecial mentions go to\nfreshers Kayleigh and Becky\nfor awesome effort in their\ndebut game. These two will\nbe forces to be reckoned with\nin the future.\nFlanker Pikey was moved to\noutside centre following some\ninjuries in the backs. She did\nan excellent job, though it\ntook a few minutes before she\nrealised that the back line\ndoesn\u2019t play in the scrum!\nThe scrum deserves a huge\nmention for massive effort\nand spectacular power in the\nface of what was not an inconsiderable weight difference.\nGood work for achieving\nwhat appeared to be impossible and turning over several\nscrums!\nThe forwards, especially\njumper Spaz, also deserve\npraise for their ever-impres-sive lineouts. Proper job!\nPlayers of the match went\nto Bendy for her massive hits\nand great ball handling, and\nto Death for her \u201cdeadly and\nsinister tackling\u201d.\nThe last special mention\ngoes to fresher Alice, who did\na truly terrible job as photographer and forgot she had\nthe camera. (This can only\nbe blamed on the enthralling quality of the game!) She\nis officially fired from this\ncapacity and next match\nwill be on the pitch. No\nexcuses about injury will be\naccepted.\nNext week we take on GKT\nin the cup, and Wye will be out\nto marmalize!\nRUGBY\nAnother victory for outstanding Wye\nBy Morten Olesen\nTickets have finally gone\non sale across the South\nKensington and Charing\nCross campuses for the\nupcoming Varsity Day.\nStudents as well as staff are\nstrongly encouraged to get\ntheir tickets as soon as pos-sible, as interest will reach\nrecord heights this year.\nThe event will take place\non Wednesday 16 February at\nthe Imperial College sports\nground at Harlington with\nthe main evening rugby game\nbeing played at the Richmond\nAthletic Association Ground.\nNamed the JPR Williams\nCup after former Wales full\nback and St Mary\u2019s old boy\nJohn Peter Rhys Williams, the\nmain evening rugby game, or\nVarsity Match, has become a\ngreat success since it started\ntwo years ago. The last two\nyears have seen closely\ncontested matches, with\nthe Imperial Medicals beating the IC side. The match\nbetween the two sides this\nyear may well become the\ntightest match in the short\nhistory of the Cup.\nAs reported in Felix last\nterm, the event has been\nexpanded this year to include\nthree men\u2019s rugby matches,\ntwo men\u2019s football matches,\ntwo men\u2019s hockey matches, a\nwomen\u2019s seven-a-side rugby\nmatch and a women\u2019s hockey\nmatch, making it an all-day\nevent. All matches apart from\nthe first XV rugby will take\nplace at Imperial\u2019s sports\nground at Harlington, near\nHeathrow, from lunchtime\nonwards.\nThe timetable for kick-off/\npush-back is as follows:\nRugby 2nds and 3rds: 2.15pm\nFootball 1sts and 2nds: 2pm\nHockey Game 1: 1pm\nHockey Game 2: 2.30pm\nHockey Game 3: 4pm\nRugby Women\u2019s 7s: 3pm\nThe results of the Varsity\nDay competitions will be\nannounced at a presentation\nat Harlington by the Imperial\nCollege Union President and\nthe Imperial Medicals Union\nPresident before the crowd\nare taken to Richmond for\nthe JPR Williams Varsity Cup\nMatch.\nThree types of ticket are\navailable:\nA \u00a310 advance ticket gives\naccess to ALL games at\nHarlington as well as the\ngame in Richmond. Included\nis coach transport from Beit\nQuad to Harlington, from\nthere to Richmond, and then\nback from Richmond to South\nKensington to finish the night\noff at the Union in South\nKensington.\nA \u00a36 advance ticket for the\nJPR Williams Cup Match\nin Richmond.

The team was\nweakened by two key forwards being pulled up to the\nThirds and one more pulling\nout to injury.\nDespite being strengthened\nby four brand new players\nturning up on the day, the\nFilthy Fourths still only had\n13 players and were forced to\nplay uncontested scrums as\nthey had only one front row\nplayer.\nLSE were immediately\non the back foot as new boy\nand later man of the match,\nJonathan Woodrow, carved\nhis way through the defence\nfor his first of two tries.\nThe opposition immediately\nresponded with a period of\npressure, scoring three quick\ntries using their pacey backs.\nImperial countered with\nanother try, this time from\nTerry Scarrott, turning on the\nengine to motor past their\nhelpless defence. A classic\npiece of wing play from a lad\nwho, prior to the game, had\nnever even held a rugby ball!\nDespite the efforts of the\nImperial side and another\nweaving run and try from Jon\nWoodrow, LSE, a well-organ-ised team who have played\ntogether much longer, scored\na further two and converted\none.\nAfter the interval, Imperial\nendeavoured to re-address\nthe balance with several periods of sustained pressure.\nImperial had a play on the\nLSE five metre line turned\nover and kicked away, denying a much needed oppor-tunity. LSE used this rapid\ngain in possession by winning\nthe lineout and, after some\nhard forward work, forcing\nanother try.\nSet pieces were quite poor\nfor the whole game, with\nImperial only winning one\nline-out; however, one smart\nset play led to Imperial\u2019s\nfourth try.\nAt an Imperial scrum on\nthe LSE 22 metre line, a sudden change of tactics led\nChav Dave to swiftly pick up\nthe ball at number eight and\npop round the blind side to\nmake use of the vast space\nthat the unaware LSE had\nleft. The ball was then given\nto number nine, Neil Harris,\nwho made a powerful run to\nfinish on his debut.\nThe final Imperial try was\nscored by the other debutant-David Hunter, who fought\nthrough two tacklers with\nsheer determination to touchdown and complete the clean\nsweep of tries for the fourth\nteam new boys.\nDespite the loss, the game\nstrengthened the team unit\nand the tries made by the\nfour new players provided\ninspiration for Imperial students interested in taking up\nthe sport. Anybody interested\nshould contact the club or\nmeet at the Union on Monday\nat 6pm for training. Who\nknows, maybe you could contribute to the fourth team\u2019s\nfirst win?\nRUGBY\nRugby Fourths make their debut\nAction at a lineout during last year\u2019s JPR Williams Cup Varsity Match\nPHOTO: IAN GILLETT\n\n"

    "content": "After the excitement of my last trip\nto the opera (that would be the time\nwhen we went to hear Bryn Terfel\u2019s\nWotan and ended up seeing him\nmime to Donald MacIntyre\u2019s rendition of the role from the orchestra pit), this was somewhat more\nsedate.\nAs always, we went to the Royal\nOpera House, (I know, I should probably try to get some variety, but I\ncan\u2019t help it, I am a creature of habit\nand the routine we have for our evenings at the opera works so well),\nthis time to enjoy some Puccini.\nThe royal opera is currently in the\nmiddle of a run of performances\nof the composer\u2019s legendary work,\nTurandot.\nFor those of you less familiar with\nthe works of Puccini, here\u2019s a brief\nsynopsis of the action; for those of\nyou who are more aware of Puccini\u2019s\nplots I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recognise his\ngeneral disregard for watertight\nstorylines.\nTurandot is the cruel daughter\nof the Chinese Emperor who has\ndecreed that she will only marry\nthe man who can solve her three\nriddles. Any man who takes up the\nchallenge and fails is to be behead-ed. The story begins in a crowd\nbefore the execution of one unfortunate failure; among the crowd\nare Calaf, Timur and Liu. Timur,\nthe blind and very fragile deposed\nking of an undisclosed kingdom, has\nbeen travelling in search of a new\nlife guided by Liu, a faithful former\nslave of the royal household who\nsecretly loves Calaf, the king\u2019s son\nwhom they had presumed dead.\nIn what is possibly one of the\nmost stupendous coincidences in all\nopera, Calaf and Timur are reunited\nwithin the first ten minutes of the\nscore. Following the touching reun-ion,Turandotmakesherfirstappear-ance to confirm that the execution is\nto take place, Calaf is reviled by\nher lack of mercy and compassion,\nbut then he sees her from afar and\ninstantly falls in love with her. Calaf\nnow must have Turandot, and so\ntakes up the challenge of the riddles\nwith a complete disregard for what\nimpact his possible failure could\nhave on his already very ill father.\nLiu\u2019s pleadings, which take the form\nof a spectacularly touching aria, fall\non deaf ears.\nAs can be expected, the riddles\nare no match for our hero\u2019s superior\nintellect. Preceding the unveiling of\nthe riddles, Turandot has her turn\nto sing her heart out as she explains\nwhy she is so cruel. Following her\nriddle\u2019s defeat by Calaf, she tries to\nbeg her father to let her renege on\nher promise to marry the man that\nsolves the riddles, but the emperor\ntells her to stop whining. Calaf, in\nhis eternal stupidity, offers Turandot\na deal: he will gladly be executed if\nshe can find out his name by dawn.\nTurandot uses her power to force\nher subjects to search high and low\nfor the stranger\u2019s name; Calaf sits\ngloating that at dawn he will win\nthe woman of his dreams in the\ninfamous Nessun Dorma aria. The\nreverie is broken up as townspeople and imperial guards try everything to force him to give up his\nname, including threatening Timur\nand Liu. This is where Calaf really\nproves his worthlessness; Liu sings\nanother beautiful aria explaining to\nTurandot how she is prepared to die\nfor her love if it will give him happi-ness, she then kills herself. Timur\nis distraught; Calaf only gives her\nsacrifice a few moments of his time\nbefore he continues his wooing of\nthe woman of no redeeming quali-ties, Turandot. Evidently there will\nbe another crisis before following on\nto a relatively happy ending where\nlove has conquered even Turandot\u2019s\nimpressive ego issues.\nUnlike the Ring cycle, this is a\nmuch more traditional production,\nwhere the scenery and the costumes as well as the action have\nbeen designed to fit with the period in which the opera is supposed\nto take place. The production is\nalready 20 years old, having being\npremiered at the Los Angeles opera\nin 1984. Unlike the production of\nSaint-Saens\u2019 Samson et Dalila from\napproximately the same period that\ngraced the stage at Covent Garden\nlast year, this production has aged\nreally rather well. While Samson et\nDalila looked dated, Turandot still\nlooked creative and visually strik-ing.\nOverall, the opera was enjoyable\n\u2013 the music is wonderfully melodic\nand there are so many wonderful\narias in the score that you would\nreally have to try hard to massacre it. There are essentially two\ncasts \u2013 for the principal roles of\nCalaf, Liu and Turandot there are\ntwo singers each. I had the pleasure of seeing Vladimir Galouzine,\nAndrea Gruber and Hei-Kyung\nHong as Calaf, Turandot and Liu.\nAs an ensemble they were good,\nhowever, the real star of the show\nwas Hei-Kyung Hong. She was spec-tacular, both technically and theatri-cally. Galouzine unfortunately had no dynamic range, his only dynamic\nbeing forte, and Gruber managed to\navoid conveying any of Turandot\u2019s\npotentially redeeming qualities; her\nvoice was harsh, and during her\naria where she explains why she\nhas enforced the \u2018solve them or die\u2019\npolicy with respect to the riddles,\nshe failed utterly to convince that\nher character had any humanity or\nthat indeed her reasons for her decision had any grounds at all.\nMy only complaint about the pro-ductionitselfisaboutthestagedirec-tions given to Turandot. Whenever\nshe was to make an important point,\nshe was made to raise her arms and\nspread them and then to stick her\nhead forward; the effect was rather\ncomical. Instead of looking authoritative she just looked like a vulture,\nand the constant repetition did not\nhelp make any point whatsoever.\nI realise that some of my comments have tended towards the neg-ative, but let me reassure you that\nan evening spent at Covent Garden\nat a performance of Turandot will\nnot be a wasted one. Despite his\nuni-dynamical style, Galouzine does\ndo a good job with Nessun Dorma,\nand Hong is stupendous. One can\nonly hope that Cellia Rose does a\ncomparable job in the role of Liu\nas she takes over for the last three\nperformances.\nOne final remark: whatever the\nfailings of Puccini\u2019s plots, they\nnever fail to move you. Liu\u2019s tragically unappreciated sacrifice is\nheart rendering, Cio-Cio-San\u2019s broken heart in Madama Butterfly will\nshatter yours in a thousand pieces\nand Mimi\u2019s final moments are dripping in pathos. Of Puccini\u2019s seven\nfull-length opera\u2019s, here I\u2019m defining that as being more than one\nAct in duration, only one ends hap-pily, La Fanciulla Del West, and\nthe rest will have you in tears. In\na rather Puccini-laden season at\nthe Royal Opera, there are many\nopportunities to go and get thoroughly depressed. Up-coming\nworks include Madama Butterlfy\nand La Boheme. La Boheme should\nbe spectacular, with the role of Mimi\nbeing shared by Angela Gheorghiu\nand Liping Zhang, two sopranos\nwith very different styles but with\nequally stunning voices and stage\npresences.\nFor details of all upcoming Puccini\noperas at the Royal Opera House, as\nwell as works by many other com-posers, go to their website www.roh.\norg.uk.

Email science.felix@ic.ac.uk with your\ncomments and comedy\nHandsupanyonewhobelieves\nthat women are physiologically different from men. Do\nyou believe that women are\ndependent while men are\nmore independent; women\nthink with their hearts rather\nthan their heads? What about\nthe role of a woman? Is it natural for a woman to want to\nmarry and have children, to\nwant the protection of a part-ner, while men yearn to make\ntheir mark on the outside\nworld? And of course, do men\ngain a higher status in life\ndue to their work being more\nimportant than that done by a\nwoman? What do these supposed differences mean for\nwomen in science?\nI should point out that I\npersonally do not believe that\nyou can so easily divide men\nand women based solely upon\ntheir sex and would fervently\nargue with anyone who would\nsuggest that women are less\nsuited to science careers than\nmen. My intention is to make\nyou think about whether you\nbelieve differences between\nthe sexes are playing a role in\nthe fate of women in science.\nAs a woman, I believe I am\nequally capable as my male\nco-workers and I must confess that I have never been\naware of any form of sexism\nholding me back from following my chosen career. But\nyou need only look around the\noffices of the academic staff\nat Imperial College to realise\nthe difference in the numbers\nof men and women in top science positions.\nRecent comments by\nthe President of Harvard\nUniversity, Lawrence\nSummers, have opened up\na huge debate on the differences between men and\nwomen in science, and his\nsubsequent apologies have\ndone little to quell the anger.\nAccording to Mr. Summers,\nwomen have less \u201cinnate\nability\u201d at science and maths\nthan men, and he believes\nthis is supported by research.\nAmong my co-workers, these\nremarks caused much anger,\nfrom both men and women,\nand had it been our Rector\nwho had expressed this\nopinion, it is possible that a\nlynch mob would have been\ndispatched rapidly from my\nbuilding.\nMr. Summers later admitted he \u201cwas wrong to have\nspoken in a way that has\nresulted in an unintended\nsignal of discouragement to\ntalented girls and women.\u201d\nWhether or not he meant to\nimply that men are better\nthan women at science, and\neven if his comments were\nmisinterpreted, a man in his\nposition should know better\nthan to make any suggestion\nconcerning differences in\nability between the sexes.\nMr. Summers made another point that has not been\npounced upon with such pas-sion. He suggested that lack\nof senior female academics\nis partly due to child-mind-ing duties and the difficulty\nfor many women to work\nthe 80 hour weeks required\nfor advancement. While this\ncomment may not bepopu-lar among many who believe\nthey do not fit this stereo-type, it is hard to deny that\nthere is not a bias towards\nwomen being the ones who\ngive up their jobs to have chil-dren. While there are always\nexceptions, I am sure that\nthere are still many people\nout there who believe that\nworking mums are somehow\nletting their children down\nand these women will often\nfeel a huge amount of guilt\nat not being there for their\nkids. The key years for professional advancement tend\nto be between 25 and 40, and\na large chunk of this period\ncan be missed if women\nhave to put their careers on\nhold for the sake of their\nfamilies.\nSo is there sexism in sci-ence? I cannot believe that\nthe difference in numbers of\nmen and women in top jobs\ncan be attributed in any way to\ngenetic differences between\nthe sexes. But perhaps there\nare still old-fashioned attitudes towards women and\nenvironmental influences\nthat impact their advancement in science careers.

The\nproject was funded through\nan Engineering Leadership\nAward from the Royal\nAcademy of Engineering and\nsupported by Bovis Lend\nLease. However, I wasn\u2019t\nlooking especially at flagship\n\u2018green\u2019 projects, but rather\nthe mainstream of construction activity.\nThis article is intended as a\nbrief overview of some of my\nexperiences and findings. I\u2019m\ncurrently working on a more\nformal write up of my travels\nand discoveries. If you would\nlike a copy, just email me at\njames.devine@ic.ac.uk.\nDubai was the first stop\non my tour. The construction industry in Dubai has\nbeen in a state of continuous boom since the 1980s. I\u2019d\nnever seen so many tower\ncranes at the same time\nbefore; it was as if the entire\ncity was being constructed\nright in front of your eyes!\nThere wasn\u2019t much evidence\nof sustainability in any of the\nprojects I had the opportunity\nto look at. Although it won a\nmention, along with energy\nefficiency, there was little evidence that it was actually a\nreal priority.\nNext stop was a flying visit\nto Hong Kong. I arrived on\na Friday afternoon in the\nmiddle of a Signal 8, which\nis apparently a fairly severe\nmonsoon. By the time I got\nto my hotel, everyone had\nbeen sent home from work\nand it was raining bucket-loads. Undaunted, I jumped\ninto a taxi and headed over to\nthe other side of Hong Kong\nisland. The taxi driver insisted I pay a danger money pre-mium, because his insurance\ndidn\u2019t extend to driving in a\nSignal 8. I paid up and within\n25 minutes we had arrived\nat Repulse Bay. Fortunately\nthe construction project, a\nhousing estate, had achieved\npractical completion a couple of weeks before, so I had\nsomewhere dry to weather\nthe rest of the storm.\nThe estate had been refitted and refurbished as part\nof a project to turn it into an\nexclusive housing complex.\nSome innovative techniques\nand practices had been used\nin the project, including some\nvery tight logistics to minimise inconvenience to sitting\ntenants. Although it hadn\u2019t\nbeen one of the specific aims\nof the project, refurbishment\nrather than demolition is\noften cited as being better\non ecological and sustainable\ngrounds.\nIt was a wet 48 hours in\nHong Kong, which included\nme accidentally setting my\nwatch two hours two fast on\nSunday morning, then madly\nrushing to the airport, when\nI could have had some more\nsleep! I caught a flight to\nTaipei, the capital of Taiwan.\nI picked it up somewhere that\nTaiwan receives 20,000 visitors from the UK each year,\nwith an averagestay lasting\nonly two days! I managed\nto negotiate my way to the\nhotel, which was surprisingly\nnice given how little I had\npaid for it.\nThe choice of visiting\nTaiwan was something of a\nwildcard, but I found a surprising body of work being\nundertaken by Bovis Lend\nLease. I took an afternoon\nout of the Taipei office to go\nfor a walk down the road and\nsee Taipei 101, the world\u2019s\ntallest building. Although not\ndirectly involved in building\nthe skyscraper, Bovis Lend\nlease had done planning and\nmanagement work on the\nshopping mall at the base of\nthe tower. I took a side trip\nto visit Tainan, in the south\nof Taiwan, where a $300m\nglass factory was being constructed for the American\nglass manufacturer Corning.\nIt was the largest single construction project I\u2019ve ever\nseen, with hundreds steel\nbeams, many over 1.5m deep,\nall working 24 hours a day to\nmeet the client\u2019s ambitious\nrequirements. Cement lorries were rolling in continuously throughout my two day\nstay. As for sustainability, I\ndidn\u2019t find it to be a particularly important issue. Prime\nfocus was instead placed on\nworker safety and meeting\nthe program deadlines.\nAfter visiting Taiwan, I flew\non to Japan and spent some\ntime working in the office\nthere. As luck would have\nit, they were engaged in the\nprocess of modelling leakage from underground petrol\ntanks for a client, so I was\nable to put my maths skills to\nuse and help out! I took some\ntime out from the project to\nvisit a few \u2018typical\u2019 Japanese\nconstruction projects, which\nwere a real culture shock\ncompared with a typical UK\nsite. Of \u2018standard\u2019 construction work ware, only a hard\nhat was needed \u2013 no steel toe-cap boots or high-vis jacket\nas would be mandatory in the\nUK. All the site workers wore\ntheir company overalls.\nI found the Japanese reputation for quality, diligence\nand efficiency to be well\nfounded. A large number of\nefficiencies were to be found\nin the construction processes\nI observed, and although they\nwere implemented for economic or legislative reasons,\nmost carried an environmental benefit which was not necessarily measured.\nSydney, Australia, was my\nnext stop, and also the headquarters of Bovis Lend Lease\nworldwide. Before spending\nsome time in the \u2018big house\u2019\nas they called it, I took a side\ntrip to Brisbane, Queensland.\nInitially, the trip had just\nbeen a way of filling time and\nvisiting more construction\nprojects before head office\ncould find me a temporary\nspace. However, Queensland\nhad many of the most \u2018sustainable\u2019 projects I encountered and a substantially different regional approach to\nthe subject. The most striking element of this difference\nwas a personal commitment,\non behalf of the engineers,\nmanagers and construction\nworkers, to maximise things\nlike recycling and minimising\nmaterial waste on site.\nReturning to Sydney, I had\nthe chance to study several\nshowcase environmental\nprojects. These are projects\nin which sustainability is key\nto the design philosophy, a\ndecision usually made at the\nexpense of minimising project\ncosts, despite the fact that\nthis does not always have to\nbe the case.\nOneparticularprojectIstudied was St. Patrick\u2019s, a housing estate conceived as being\nconstructed in harmony with\nthe sensitive local environment and local community.\nAnother project was the head\noffice building itself. \u201830 The\nBond\u2019, to use its official title,\nhas achieved class-leading\nscores using the Australian\n\u2018Green Star\u2019 ratings tool. The\nholistic approach applies not\nonly to the engineering choices which have been made\nin construction, but also to\nthe creation of a bio-diverse\nplanted roof and the adoption\nof an engagement plan with\nthe local community. There\nare also some outlandish and\ninteresting features, mostly\nrevolving around the use of\nmaterials for fit-out. These\nare so called \u2018low embodied\nenergy materials\u2019 or \u2018rapidly renewable\u2019, and included\noffice interior cork walls and\ngoat\u2019s hair carpets!\nThe final stop on my tour\nwas Los Angeles. In LA, I\nspent some time with the\n\u2018Fire Bond Program\u2019, which\naims to build new fire stations\nfor the city of Los Angeles, all\nof which will be environmentally certified through the\nUS LEAD program. It was\nan interesting office to work\nin, with a number of uniform\n\u2018Fire Chiefs\u2019 from the LA Fire\nDepartment.\nOn site visits, I was really\nstruck by the extensive use\nof timber as a building mate-rial. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t\nsourced from rapidly renewable or managed forests, but\nas such represents a substantial opportunity for improve-ment. There were also clear\nsigns that suppliers and subcontractors were being challenged by the inclusion of an\nenvironmental metric in their\nperformance assessment.\nWith the correct incentives,\ncontractors were finding\ninnovative ways to raise the\nrecycled content of the finished building, such as raising the proportion of fly ash\nin concrete, whilst balancing\nthe effect this would have on\nits structural properties.\nTo give an exceedingly brief\nsummary of the whole trip:\nIn sustainable construction, a\nhuge difference can be made\nthrough strong personal commitment to sustainability and\na willingness to challenge\nand ask questions of others\ninvolved in the process.\nOn site at Jacksons Landing, a housing development in Sydney, Australia\nThe Hoover Dam, on the border between Arizona and Nevada, USA\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 27 January 2005\n12\n\n"

    "content": "Is it right for parents to have an embryo selected as a donor for their terminally ill living child?\nIgnacio Quinones looks at a question that has enormous consequences for who we are\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 27 January 2005\n4\nHow far would you go to save\nyour brother\u2019s life? If he was\nsitting in the room next to\nyours, quietly enduring one\nof many painful blood trans-fusions, waiting for a dona-tion, would you not open the\ndoor to help him? Now imagine that you owed your existence to him. That somebody\nelse had you born so that a\npart of you would provide a\ncure for your brother\u2019s ill-ness. Imagine that you could\nactually have been a different\nperson altogether, but instead\nyou were \u2018planned\u2019 to be a\ncertain way. Could this be a\nstep too far?\nThere\u2019s an ongoing heated\ndebate about the use of controversial genetic screening\ntechniques by couples wanting to save the life of a terminally ill child by creating\na \u2018designer\u2019 sibling to act as\na stem cell donor. You may\nhave heard about the Hashmi\nfamily from Leeds, whose\nfive-year-old son Zain has had\nover 100 blood transfusions\ndue to a potentially fatal blood\ndisorder, Beta Thalassaemia.\nThis condition could be treated by a stem cell transplant,\nbut the failure to find a suitable donor with a compatible\nblood group forced the family\nto consider alternatives. The\npossibility of conceiving a new\nbaby, who could then act as a\ndonor for their ill son, arose.\nThe new infant would be\nconceived by In-Vitro fertilisation (IVF) followed by\nPreimplantation Genetic\nDiagnosis (PGD) to ensure\ncompatibility with Zain\u2019s\nblood type. PGD evaluates\nthe genetic characteristics of\nthree-day-old embryos before\nthey are implanted in the\nmother\u2019s womb. In this case,\nthe embryos would only be\nselected should they prove to\nbe a match for their future\nbrother. Any other embryos\nwould be discarded.\nPGD is not a new tech-nique; it has been used since\nthe 1980s in over 2500 different situations worldwide. It\nis used by families that risk\nthe conception of a child\nwith a serious genetic condi-tion, such as Cystic Fibrosis\nor Beta Thalassaemia. The\ntechnique was deemed to\nbe controversial as it led to\nthe discarding of embryos,\nan act considered as murder\nby groups that believe that\na human life is formed upon\nconception. These opposing\nvoices were quietened down,\nhowever, by the conclusion\nthat the born child would benefit directly from the use of\nsuch a technique, which has\nbeen in use in the UK since\nthe early 1990s.\nHowever, in the case of the\nHashmi family, it is not the\nunborn child that benefits\nfrom this application of PGD.\nWhen embryos are selected,\nthose being discarded might\nbe healthy embryos that\nunfortunately do not match\nthe blood type of their sibling\nand are therefore denied the\nchance to live. This was the\nprice to pay in exchange for\nsaving little Zain\u2019s life. The\ndebate rages on, as there is\ncontroversy regarding whether this is too high a price to\npay.\nThe court\u2019s decision to have\nthe operation funded by the\nNHS has forced this highly\ntopical issue into the public\neye. This type of operation\ncan be required by as much\nas two dozen couples each\nyear, at a cost of \u00a320,000 for\nthe four rounds of procedures\nthat are often required. From\na purely economical point of\nview, the NHS might profit\nfrom such procedures if we\nwere to compare them with\nthe price of lifetime treatment\nfor a patient suffering from\nThalassaemia, which nears\nthe \u00a31m mark. But money is\nnot the main issue here.\nEthically speaking, the welfare of the unborn child is the\nmain issue that causes con-cern. If the child was born but\nunexpectedlyfailedtoproduce\na suitable cure for its brother,\nhow would that be regarded\nby the parents? Would the\nchild be conceived simply as a\nmeans to save a life, or would\nit be fully accepted as part of\nthe family? It can be argued\nthat the reason for having\na child by all couples is not\nalways perfectly selfless, and\nindeed some couples\u2019 motivation to have a child naturally\nmay be deemed as unethical\n(having a child to save a mar-riage, for example). But then\nagain, not all couples ask for\npublic funds for such causes.\nAnother source of concern is\nthe fear that this could be the\nbeginning of a \u2018slippery slope\u2019,\nthe road that leads to eugen-ics. The genetic improvement\nof humans and the generation\nof super-human \u201cdesigner\nbabies\u201d is still very far from\nbeing technically feasible,\nbut for certain sectors of the\npublic, genetic screening of\nembryos is the thin edge of a\nvery large wedge. Regulatory\nbodies such as the Human\nFertilisation and Embryology\nAuthority serve to prevent\nsuch events by monitoring\nPGD on a case by case basis,\nbut there has certainly been a\nrelaxation in the laws.\nWhen considering all these\nfactors we must take into\naccount what is achieved by\nthe technique. In this case,\nunless a suitable donor is\nfound, the only alternative is\nfor Zain to lead a life of hospitals and endless blood transfu-sions. A \u2018saviour sibling\u2019 could\nbe born instead, to provide\nhim with healthy stem cells\nand give him a chance at \u2018real\u2019\nlife. We cannot know if the\nfamily will welcome the child\nin its own right or whether\nhe will be treated as a con-venience. In the same way,\nonly time will tell whether\nthis is the road to eugenics\nand \u201cdesigner babies\u201d. At the\nmoment, a little boy needs aid\nand it is within our capacity to\nhelp him.\n\u201cThere is an ongoing\nheated debate\nabout the use of\ncontroversial genetic\nscreening techniques\u201d\nAm I my brother\u2019s designer sibling?\nChild of our time: is it right for an embryo to be selected\non the basis of its usefulness in saving the life of a sibling?\nPerfect antidotes: placebos and nocebos\nBy Giovanna Larice\nBiochemistry department\nSeveral studies have shown\nthat placebos, Latin for \u201cI\nshall please\u201d, may actually do\nmore than that and improve\nhealth.\nThe placebo effect, an\nobservable or felt improvement of health not ascribable\nto an active drug, has been\nknown for some time now.\nLong term medical research\nhas suggested that some\nsick people feel better after\ntaking a \u2018dummy pill\u2019 simply\nbecause they think it is real\nmedicine.\nUntil now, the placebo\neffect has been assumed\nto be psychological, with\npatients simply believing that\nthey are feeling better, yet\nrecent studies have unveiled\na direct biochemical basis\nto the phenomenon. A real\nchemical response may actually be occurring in patients.\nExperimental results released\nthis year on Parkinson\u2019s disease showed that the neurons\nof patients receiving a simple\nsalt solution at the University\nof Turin in Italy responded in\nthe same way as when they\nhad received an active drug\nthat had earlier eased their\nsymptoms.\nEvidence for a biochemical\nbasis of the placebo effect has\nalso been observed in patients\nsuffering from depression.\nDoctors have known for years\nthat many depressed patients\nreport improvements in their\nmood after being given placebos (such as sugar pills)\nbut only of late have placebos been associated with a\nchange in brain function. This\nsuggests that placebos may\nrepresent an active treatment\ncondition. Research conducted by the psychiatrist Andrew\nF. Leuchter and published\nin the American Journal of\nPsychiatry in January 2002\nwas the first to show that\npatients with severe depression show alterations in brain\nfunctioning improvement irrespective of whether the drug\nis placebo or active.\nAccording to Mr Leuchter,\nthe hope associated with the\npotential for a treatment\u2019s\neffectiveness and the conviction of taking a real drug, along\nwith positive interactions with\nthe health providers, may\nall contribute to the placebo\neffect by having a significant\nbiochemical effect. Sensory\nexperience and thoughts are\nknown to affect neurochem-istry, which in turn is able to\naffect other biochemical systems such as the immune sys-tem. It follows that a person\u2019s\nmood may psychosomatically\naffect their wellbeing or ability\nto recover from illness.\nA tantalizingquestion is then\nraised: do patients who benefit\nfrom taking antidepressants\ndo so thanks to the pill itself\nor simply to the act of taking\na pill?\nAll the same, many medical ethicists, such as Howard\nBrody of Michingan State\nUniversity, believe that administering a placebo to a patient\nin the old-fashioned way is\ndeceptive, unethical, and\nin most cases should not be\ndone. Mr Brody takes it one\nstep further and claims that\nthe placebo effect need not\ndepend on making use of a\nplacebo at all and can instead\nsimply be achieved by positive\nfeelings created in the health\ncare environment.\nOther researchers suggest\nthat the mysterious placebo\neffect can be used in conjunction with other medicines and\nharnessed to improve drug\nefficacy - for example, by presenting drugs to patients in\nan optimistic and encouraging light. Ethical problems\nmay arise however, if doctors\nfail to elucidate all possible\nside effects in an attempt to\nmanipulate a patient\u2019s view on\nthe drug.\nThe placebo\u2019s wicked double\nis the altogether less notorious\nnocebo, Latin for \u201cI will harm\u201d.\nThis is a harmless treatment\nthat induces harmful effects\nin a patient due to negative\nexpectations or the psychological condition of the patient.\nThe term nocebo became\npopular in the 1990s, when\nscientists wanted to understand the factors that lead to\nnegative effects in treatments,\nsuch as non-specific medication side effects. Unlike its\nvirtuous twin, a nocebo isn\u2019t\ngenerally a medication, but\nan influence (such as a belief,\ncertain cultural factors, or a\nmindset). Furthermore, noce-bos are far less well-docu-mented in scientific literature,\nas ethical concerns prevent\nthem from being regularly\nused in research and in medical practice.\nNonetheless, some studies have been carried out to\nsupport the nocebo theory. In\nthe Framingham study for the\n20-year incidence of myocardial infarction and coronary\ndeath, data showed that, independently of commonly recognised factors that may lead to\ncoronary death, women who\nbelieved they were more likely\nto experience a heart attack\nwere actually 3.7 times more\nlikely to do so than women\nthat had no such belief.\nAre common expressions\nsuch as \u2018scared to death\u2019 and\n\u2018worried sick\u2019 that have long\nbeen part of our vocabulary\njust mere exaggerations, or do\nthey represent an underlying\nrealisation of the significance\nof mind over matter?\nModern scientists should be\nless ignorant of the fascinating\npower our psyches can have\nover our health and wellbeing,\nand should learn to merge the\nbody and mind in order to harness these amazing phenomena to our advantage.\n\u201cDo patients who\nbenefit from taking\nantidepressants do so\nthanks to the pill itself\nor simply the act of\ntaking a pill?\u201d\nPlacebo: awful band, but recent research trials have\nshown their biochemical effectiveness in medicine\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

He was unhurt. The\ndriver of the taxi blamed Mr\nHoucke for the collision and\nattempted to place him under\na citizen\u2019s arrest. Police were\ncalled to the scene, where\nthey questioned the two men\nbut took no further action.\nMr Houcke told Felix: \u201cI was\nwalking across the pedestrian crossing. He was probably\ndoing well over 30mph.\u201d\nA short distance away,\nExhibition Road is set to\nbe the site of a pilot \u2018traffic calming\u2019 scheme, in\nwhich all markings would be\nremoved and no-one would\nhave automatic right of way.\nPedestrians would be able to\ncross the road anywhere, and\na 20mph speed limit could\nbe introduced. The scheme\nwould be part of a \u00a325m redevelopment of the area.\nThe idea has been used successfully in Holland and is\nalso being trialled in Seend,\nWiltshire. Its supporters\nclaim that it encourages drivers to slow down and take\nmore notice of pedestrians.\nWiltshire County Council\nsays that accidents in Seend\nhave fallen by a third and the\naverage driving speed has\ndropped by 5% since roads\u2019\ncentral white lines were\nremoved.\nHowever, the scheme has\nreceived widespread criti-cism. Edmund King, executive director of the RAC, said:\n\u201cAlthough this might make\ndrivers more careful, it could\nalso encourage the aggressive motorist to behave more\nrecklessly. We would certainly\nquestion whether this type of\nexperiment should be implemented on a wider scale.\u201d\nMr Houcke, following his\nencounter with the taxi, said\nof the \u2018naked road\u2019 scheme:\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought it\nwould work, considering people cross the road so frequently and drivers go so fast.\u201d\nSam Rorke, Deputy\nPresident (Education and\nWelfare) of Imperial College\nUnion, told Felix: \u201cWe [the\nUnion] are excited to see if it\nworks, but concerned about\npossible safety implications\nfor students, given the large\nnumber needing to cross\nExhibition Road. Personally\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of dangerous\ndrivers in the area\u201d.\nA decision on the future of\nExhibition Road will be made\nin the next few months.\nMechanical engineering student Dan Houcke answers questions from police after being\nhit by a taxi on Prince Consort Road on Tuesday. Proposals to remove all traffic lights,\nkerbs, crossings and signs from nearby Exhibition Road are being considered by\nKensington and Chelsea Council, with a decision expected in the next few months\n\n"

Say goodbye to\nlast year\u2019s tedium (more commonly known as Roosta, Kasabian and\nKeane) and say hello to London\u2019s\nhottest live act, the brilliant General\nKhaki.\nFormed from the ashes of General\nTommy Mack\u2019s previous outfit, The\nShakes, General Khaki are a force to\nbe reckoned with, offering the most\noriginal and compelling take on\ngarage rock since the White Stripes.\nWith influences ranging from the\nClash to Captain Beefheart and the\nBeach Boys, General Khaki deliver\ntheir most captivating introductory message with immense wit at\nbreakneck speed.\nTheir live demo, comprising seven\nminutes of pure sonic assault,\nstarts with the General\u2019s self-promoting opening shot Give Us\nThe Bullets And We\u2019ll Shoot The\nGuns, a garage-punk frenzy delivered with seriousness and army-march style drums timed to precision by Daniel Mack. Endearing to\nthe end, the ironic yet ska-tinged\nAnimal displays the Khakis\u2019 more\nflippant slower side, with kooky lyrics to put a smile on both the listener\nand Lance Bombardier Kat Stevens\u2019\nface.\nGood Guys And Bad Guys is the\nband on top form: catchy, dance-able and taking a well-deserved potshot at Dubya and his futile war on\nIslam: \u201cYou can tell a bad guy with a\nbeard and a moustache, he likes to\nride a camel and he likes to smoke\nhash.\u201d The EP is rounded off with\nthe fantastic Stone Roses inspired\nSwagger, the track to epitomise\nwhat rock and roll should be \u2013 irrev-erent, sexy, brooding and command-ing, whilst letting the listener have\nan excellent time.\n\u201cShow us your swagger\u201d and\nGeneral Khaki will show you the\nway. Take the draft at www.gener-alkhaki.com. Sajini Wijetilleka\nSINGLE REVIEWS\nAt the end of the day, truly great\nmusic can either be put down to its\ncontext or its timelessness. Music\nthat may not stand the test of time\nmay be great purely because it\nsaved everyone\u2019s life from Travis\nand inspired a generation to back\naway from the acoustic guitar. Right\nnow, we\u2019re truly in the middle of an\namplified music scene with everyone picking up guitars and shouting the immortal lines of Art Brut:\n\u201cLook at us! We formed a band!\u201d\nBut wonderful bands such as the\nFutureheads also follow the tiresome likes of The Others. So which\ncategory do Stoke-on-Trent\u2019s Agent\nBlue fall under? If this single is anything to go by then they could soon\nbe up there with the best of them.\nSinger Nick Andrews does a nice\nJoe Strummer via Sam Herlihy\n(Hope Of The States) impression\nwhen he spits condemnation upon\nour generation: \u201cWhat will you tell\nyour children\u2019s children when they\nask where have their homes gone? /\nWill you tell them you lit the fires?\u201d\nThe music never feels stagnant\nand resembles Bloc Party in its\ndriving and climactic guitar\ndualism. It may feel predictable at\nturns but that\u2019s only because you\u2019re\nhearing what you want to hear:\ninspired music by individuals with a\nmessage. Matty Hoban\nI picked up this record because it\nsaid \u201cHorny Pony\u201d on the front. I\u2019m\nyet to work out why; I think it may be\ntheir PR company. With a name like\nFierce Girl, I was expecting shonky\nCamden indie whores with too much\neye makeup and little or no knowledge of how a guitar works, except\nthat when you do this it makes a\nreally loud noise. In short, I was\nexpecting it to be awesome.\nBut oh dear no. It\u2019s actually two\nchavs singing about other chavs,\nand being general obnoxious chav\nbastards over crap chavvy dance\nbeats. I bravely put on my investigative journalist hat and Googled\nthem. When asked in an interview as\nto what was currently floating their\nboat, they listed \u201cTanya Turner, The\nCock, Marlboro Lights, Peaches,\nLucy Liu, Burberry, Bad Girls, Vin\nDiesel, Horsemeat Disco, any kind\nof beer, White Van Men, Aaliyah, but\nmost of all... Kat Slater.\u201d They are\neven worse than suggested by the\nNME, who (thinking that this was\na compliment) described them as\na mix between Fischerspooner and\nThe Streets. Unholy.\nI looked at the video and it was the\ntwo skinheads who make up Fierce\nGirl waving their hands aggressively\nat the screen for three minutes and\n33 seconds. This is the soundtrack to\nyou getting knifed. And I\u2019m guessing\nthat that is not a pleasant occur-rence, but then again neither is this\nrecord. James Millen\nI love rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\nGeneral Khaki, featuring Tommy Mack of our very own (sadly departed) The Shakes,\nbring us their new demo\nGeneral Khaki\nGood Guys And Bad Guys\nAgent Blue\nChildren\u2019s Children\nMCA\nHHHHI\nFierce Girl\nWhat Makes A Girl Fierce?\nRed Flag\nIIIII\n\n"

    "content": "Patching together key events in\nthe life of legendary musician Ray\nCharles and peppered with standout\nsongs, this is a tear-jerking, toe-tap-ping biopic that serves as testament\nto the man\u2019s passion and resilience.\nSeven-year-old Ray (Foxx) loses\nhis sight two years after watching his little brother drown, but his\nmother Aretha refuses to coddle\nhim. Through a somewhat \u2018tough\nlove\u2019 approach to parenting, she\nforces her son to learn to stand on\nhis own two feet and becomes the\nembodiment of strength throughout\nhis life.\nThe film carries on to tell us about\nRay\u2019s rise to fame and how other\nthings in his life almost destroyed\nwhat he loved the most \u2013 his music.\nAs an adult he is exploited by nearly everybody he meets, but nearly\neverybody recognizes that he has\nreal talent. In spite of his blindness,\nhe seems to be able to function\nalmost as if he can see. He cleverly\ngets around many problems of the\nblind by using his hearing and his\nmemory. He insists that he be paid\nonly in one dollar bills to avoid the\ndanger of being short-changed. But\nhe gets along and eventually has\ncontracts; first with Atlantic Records\nand then with ABC-Paramount.\nEvidently his major handicap is not\nhis blindness, but a taste for women\nand heroin.\nDemons sprout from guilt about\nhis brother\u2019s death, or at least that\u2019s\nthe way Hackford draws it. Unsubtle\nscenes include Ray knocking desperately on a bathroom door where\nothers are getting high, and suddenly he\u2019s wading ankle-deep in water.\nLater, when going cold turkey, the\nmemory becomes a horrific hallucination with water turning to blood.\nIt may be slightly clumsy but it\u2019s\ndone so well. Stylistically this film\nis amazing \u2013 there\u2019s something very\nold school about it, and some of the\nscenes are beautifully shot. But the\nmajor selling point here is Jamie\nFoxx.\nRay Charles has some pretty\ndistinct mannerisms. Foxx takes\nCharles\u2019 manner, his personal-ity, his flaws, his shrewdness, he\ntakes it all. You constantly forget\nyou are watching him; it is like they\nactually managed to turn back the\nclock to Charles\u2019 youth. Foxx really\nis magnetic. The insanely rich and\ndetailed production design doesn\u2019t\nhurt, either.\nThis film pulls no punches of vanity or reverence for the blues-gospel\nking. It is gratifying to know that\nMr Charles himself screened the\nfilm and enjoyed it greatly. He\u2019s a\nman whose god was music and who\nfiltered God\u2019s music through his\nmorally ambiguous life and made\nit something special, to which generations have connected. Music is\nwhat Ray Charles is all about, and\nthe music that he made, the impact\nthat he made, despite all the obstacles (self-imposed or not), stand the\ntest of time. Any pain he might have\nfelt or caused was what made that\nmusic, and we have to take the good\nwith the bad to get anything so spe-cial.\nIt\u2019s a fantastic performance, and\nthe music selections they choose\nto follow his rises and falls is a\ngreat spread of his work. I don\u2019t\nmean to detract from any of the\nother performances in the film \u2013\nthe women who play his mother\n(Sharon Warren) and his wife (Kerry\nWashington) and his major mistress\n(Regina King) are all singularly talented and deserve recognition.\nIt\u2019s hard to go wrong with a film\nthat shows Southern discrimina-tion, sex and drugs, and glues it\ntogether with the soulful music of\nRay Charles. The film is at its best\nshowing the roots of the character.\nBut the music is fine and is what will\nplease audiences. This is an amazing and touching film \u2013 one in which\nyou can actually say the actor truly\nmade it great. Haj Alttahir\nJamie Foxx could win an Oscar\nA man who thought harder and went further than anyone thought possible impresses on a\nglobal scale\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 27 January 2005\n22\nRay\nDirector: Taylor Hackford\nStarring: Jamie Foxx,\nKerry Washington, Regina King,\nSharon Warren\nLength: 152 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHHH\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe extraordinary life story of Ray Charles\nA hot piece of action?\nLadder 49 is the film industry\u2019s\nlatest attempt to encapsulate the\nbravery and heroism of American\nfirefighters post 9/11. The story follows the career of Baltimore firefighter Jack Morrison (Phoenix)\nseen through reflections of his life\nas he lies trapped in a blazing twenty storey building.\nThe film deserves credit for many\ngood points \u2013 Disney have certainly\nmade an excellent job of keeping it\nfocused on the human side of what\nbeing in a firefighting team entails\nrather than allowing themselves to\nget carried away with clich\u00e9d, over-the-top displays of heroics against\nburning backdrops. Both Phoenix\nand Travolta deliver powerful and\nmoving performances and the casting of Phoenix \u2013 not your stereotypically rugged \u2018hero\u2019 \u2013 adds depth\nand realism to the role. Travolta\ngives a flawless performance as the\nfirefighting team\u2019s captain, and the\nacting of the supporting cast cannot\nbe faulted either.\nThe movie progresses nicely as\nwe see Phoenix start off as a fresh-faced young rookie. Both the plot\nand the characters are given plenty\nof time to develop, as you gradually\nacquaint yourself with the members\nof Ladder 49.\nAnother plus is the interesting\nmix of emotions and genres experienced whilst watching the movie.\nSome scenes detailing the sense of\ncamaraderie amongst the Ladder\n49 team will have you laughing\nout loud in your seat, whilst other\nscenes will have the more sensitive\nmembers of the audience reaching\nfor tissues.\nThere was something about this\nfilm, however, that failed to leave\nthe mark of a true classic. Perhaps\nit was the fact that, although some\nscenes were charged with raw emo-tion, they sometimes bordered on\nbecoming clich\u00e9d. More than that,\nhowever, is the undeniable fact that\nfirefighting heroics are best suited\nto the small screen and are really\nnot the material of Hollywood block-busters. The scenario of a fire can\nonly lead to one logical conclusion\nfrom a firefighter\u2019s point of view\n\u2013 saving the people inside the building and getting themselves out: a\nsimple premise that doesn\u2019t leave\nthe audience guessing. The team\neither make it or they don\u2019t.\nGiven the difficulty of finding an\ninteresting plot set amongst accidental fires, Disney has done a surprisingly good job of coming up with\na storyline that is suitably plausible\nand engaging. Not surprisingly, this\nfilm grossed some $73m in the US\nwhere it whetted the public\u2019s appetite for fire fighting heroics.\nOverall, it is difficult to find too\nmuch to fault in this movie. Some\nscenes are memorable and some\nsoundbites will stay with you after\nit has ended, but it also needs to be\nsaid that you would not be missing\nanything if you were to wait for the\nDVD release. Marya Ziauddin\nLadder 49\nDirector: Jay Russell\nStarring: Joaquin Phoenix,\nJohn Travolta, Robert Patrick,\nJacinda Barrett\nLength: 98 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nHHIII\n\u201cYou constantly forget you are watching\nFoxx; it is like they\nactually managed to\nturn back the clock\u201d\nShit. That was a good curry\nListings: page 13\n\u201cYou would not be\nmissing anything if\nyou were to wait for\nthe DVD release\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 27 January 2005\nNIGHTLIFE clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\n19\nCLUB REVIEW\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know,\nHed Kandi it is one of the fastest\ngrowing house labels. If you go to\nany Hed Kandi event, you can see\nwhy \u2013 it\u2019s special. There are other\nwords I could use, but most couldn\u2019t\nbe printed, so let\u2019s just say it was\ngood.\nIt\u2019s not just about the music, it\u2019s\nthe whole atmosphere of every\nevent, be it at El Divinos in Ibiza or\nBed in Sheffield. You are provided\nwith a live act, dancers, entertain-ers, an amazing environment... and\nthis is before the crowd comes in\nand it really goes off.\nEach time is an extremely pleasurable experience leaving you fulfilled in every way. It\u2019s on a par with\nthe first time you discover mastur-bation. Come on girls, don\u2019t act like\nyou don\u2019t do it as well.\nThis was the first time for me\nto go to Pacha, and having been a\nregular at most Hed Kandi events\nhere and abroad, I had high expectations and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\nThe dance floor was rammed by\n10.30 and although it was meant to\nhave been a quiet night for clubbing\nafter the expense of Christmas, it\ndidn\u2019t show. People were queuing\naround the side of the building at\n9pm, an hour before the event even\nstarted.\nFor such a popular event, the door\nstaff were surprisingly welcoming\nand unstressed. One guy told me\nthis was a piece of piss compared\nto the launch of their new album\nbefore Christmas.\nOnce inside, the club looked like\nthe sexiest person on earth had just\nexploded, covering the place in pure\nand utter gorgeous fabulousness.\nOne thing to understand about any\nHed Kandi event is that it\u2019s like\nbeing at a fashion show. It is essential to look good and when you get\ninside you can see why everyone is\nso damn sexy.\nI can understand this may be a bit\ndaunting, as some Imperial students\nare unfamiliar with the world outside their bedroom, calculator and\nrecent issue of Star Trek Weekly.\nIf you own a Hed Kandi album,\nyou will have an idea of the type of\nmusic you will be letting yourself\nin for at an event like this. Pacha\nis spread over two rooms \u2013 the\nmain room was all about deep disco\nhouse, and upstairs was dark, sexy\nand dirty. OK, Hed Kandi lacks a\nlittle in terms of perfect mixing and\ntiming, but the crowd doesn\u2019t care.\nThey sing along at any opportunity\nthey can and as soon as Pav, the per-cussionist, and Laura on sax come\non, you forget all about some of the\nnot-great mixing.\nThis is another thing with Hed\nKandi \u2013 you don\u2019t just get a DJ, you\nget a bit of live action as well. I\u2019ve\nnever seen people get so excited\nover the sight of a slightly bearded\nfat man thrashing about and a girl\nand her horn. It was so good that\nat one point the DJ stopped and\nthe crowd leapt and cheered to the\nsounds of a sax and a set of bongos.\nI think the phrase I heard most\nthroughout the evening was \u201cthis is\nfucking fantastic\u201d.\nI won\u2019t spoil it too much for those\nintending on going to the next Hed\nKandi event, but I can say you had\nbetter dust off your disco rags as\nit\u2019s about going to a sexy venue,\nbeing sexy and dancing to the best\nsexy music.

The San Jose,\nCalifornia, company reported\nnet income of $205.4 million,\nup from $142.5 million, in the\ncomparable period last year.\nThe result matched the company\u2019s forecast. Excluding\nthe amortization of intangibles and some stock option\nexpenses, however, eBay\nsaid it would have reported\nincome of 33 cents per share;\njust shy of the 34 cents per\nshare expected by Wall Street\nanalysts.\nRevenue climbed 44% to\n$935.8 million from $648.4 mil-lion, surpassing the company\u2019s prediction of $915 mil-lion.\nFor the year 2005, eBay said\nit expects revenue of $4.25\nto $4.35 billion and earnings\nper share excluding certain\nexpenses of $1.48 to $1.52.\nAnalysts had been expecting annual revenue of $4.37\nbillion and earnings of $1.61,\naccording to Thomson First\nCall.\n\u201cThis was a surprisingly\nsoft report for eBay during a strong quarter\u201d, said\nMark Mahaney, an analyst\nat American Technology\nResearch. Adjusting for the\nimpact of foreign exchange,\nthe company\u2019s revenue grew\n39%, significantly slower than\nthe 48% growth rate in the\nthird quarter, Mahaney said.\nThe company\u2019s internation-al-business growth rate also\nappeared to lag most expec-tations.\nEBay shares plunged 12%,\nto $90.92 in after-hours trad-ing, after falling $3.32 in 4\npm Nasdaq composite trad-ing. However, EBay shares\nsoared 80% last year, briefly\ngiving the ten-year-old company a market value of more\nthan $75 billion.\nDespite the concerns about\nslowing growth, eBay has\nbeen benefitting from the\ngrowing popularity of internet\nshopping. Consumers spent\n$15.8 billion on the web during\nthe November and December\nholiday season, up 29% from\nthe previous year, according\nto comScore Networks Inc., a\nmarket-research firm. EBay,\nwhich began promoting itself\na few years ago through\nholiday television and print\nadvertising, has become an\nincreasingly important web\ndestination for consumers\nshopping for holiday gifts.\n\u201cOnline is becoming a key\ncomponent of holiday shopping,\u201d said Rajiv Dutta,\neBay\u2019s CFO. The company\nhas been adding and promoting features to help holiday\nshoppers, such as its \u201cBuy\nit now\u201d feature that allows\nusers to buy an item for a set\nprice, without waiting for the\nclose of an auction.\nEBay executives remain\nconfident enough to increase\ninvestment plans for this\nyear to more than $300 million from an original $200\nmillion. Dutta said much of\nthe additional money would\nbe directed at eBay\u2019s PayPal\npayment-processing unit and\nits relatively new China oper-ation. Dutta also said eBay\nwill accelerate its expansion\nof PayPal internationally by\nintroducing the service in\nmore countries, and invest\n$100 million in China, the\nworld\u2019s fastest growing econ-omy. \u201cWe see even greater\nopportunity in China today\nthan we did six months ago,\u201d\nsaid Chief Executive Officer\nMeg Whitman.\nEBay also declared a 2-for-1\nstock split to shareholders of\nrecord on 31 January.\nRevenue from eBay\u2019s US\nauctions business, its biggest\nunit, rose 24% to $362.7 mil-lion. Revenue from the international auctions business\nrose 64% to $344.3 million.\nRevenue from PayPal rose\n53% to $200.2 million.\nFor 2004, eBay reported net\nincome of $778.2 million, or\n$1.14 a share, compared with\nnet income of $441.8 million,\nor 67 cents, a year earlier.\nRevenue climbed 51% to $3.27\nbillion, from $2.17 billion;\nslightly higher than the company\u2019s previous forecast of\n$3.25 billion.\nMotorola\nMotorola Inc., the US tele-com-equipment maker, said\nits share of the global market\nfor mobile phones surged in\nthe fourth quarter because\nof a large rollout of handsets\nloaded with new features.\nThe company said its net\nincome soared 34% to $654\nmillion from $489 million a\nyear earlier.\nChairman and CEO Ed\nZander, who took over the top\nposition at Motorola a year\nago, said the new models\nhelped increase the company\u2019s global handset market\nshare to 16.6%, compared\nwith 13.7% a year earlier and\n13.4% in the third quarter.\nNokia, of Finnish origins,\nhas the largest share with\n31.4% as of the third quar-ter, according to IDC, a technology research firm. Nokia\nwill report its fourth-quarter\nearnings later this month\nwhich should go some way in\nrevealing how well the introduction of its 7260 and 6670\nhave gone.\nMotorola apparently has\nregained the number two\nranking after conceding that\nspot earlier in 2004 to South\nKorea\u2019s Samsung Electronics\nCo. Samsung has stumbled\nrecently, with reportings from\nlast week indicating that its\nnet profit in the fourth quarter fell 2% as margins tight-ened.\nMotorola reported revenue\nof $8.84 billion in the quar-ter, a 27% increase from a\nyear earlier. The company\u2019s\noverall performance, which\nexceeded market expecta-tions, was driven by strong\nsales in the handset division,\nwhich accounts for about 40%\nof its total revenue. Motorola\nshipped 31.8 million handsets\nin the quarter, a 42% increase\nfrom the fourth quarter a year\nearlier.\nThe fourth quarter is critical because holiday sales can\nmake or break the whole year\nand can determine momentum going into the new year.\nA year ago, Motorola stumbled badly in the quarter,\nwhen several key handsets\ndidn\u2019t reach the market.\nYahoo\nYahoo, the Californian\ninternet company, reported\na fourth-quarter profit nearly\nquintupled from a year earlier\nas it continued to benefit from\na surge in online advertising.\nThefirmclaimednetincome\nrising to $373 million (25 cents\nper share) from $75 million (5\ncents per share) a year ear-lier. Revenues rose 62% to an\nastounding $1.1 billion from\n$664 million. Not including\nprofits from the sale of shares\nin Google Inc by Yahoo during the quarter, Yahoo\u2019s profit\nwould have been $187 million (13 cents per share). That\nexceeded the earnings of 11\ncents per share expected by\nmany senior analysts. Also,\nexcluding commissions paid\nto marketing partners, Yahoo\nreported revenues of $75 million above the company\u2019s projection of $710 million. Yahoo\u2019s\nChairman and CEO, Terry\nSemel, called 2004 \u201cthe year\nin which we witnessed the\nbeginning of a tipping point in\nadvertising,\u201d with more mainstream advertisers increasing their marketing online.\nAdvertising-related revenue rose 67% from a year\nearlier and accounted for 85%\nof Yahoo\u2019s revenue, the same\nas the previous quarter when\ncompared with like-for-like\nsales. Semel also said both of\nYahoo\u2019s major ad categories\n\u2013 search-related advertising\nand brand advertising such as\nbanner ads \u2013 grew strongly.\nYahoo has profited from\na broader rebirth in online\nadvertising driven partly by\nsearch-related ads. US online\nadvertising revenue, for both\nYahoo and its rivals, totalled\nmore than $6.8 billion in the\nfirst three quarters of 2004;\nnearlyequallingthe$7.3billion\nspent in all of 2003, according\nto trade group the Interactive\nAdvertising Bureau. Online\nad revenue last year could\nexceed the $8 billion in 2000,\nthe biggest year before the\nrecent slump. Yahoo\u2019s gains\nin search-related advertising\nare \u201cvolume-driven\u201d; revenue\nper search was flat from the\nprevious quarter, but the\nnumber of search queries\nconducted on Yahoo and its\naffiliate sites increased in the\n\u201cdouble digits\u201d from a year\nearlier. Yahoo attributed the\nper-search pricing trends to a\nseasonal surge in retail-relat-ed advertising, which generally requires lower rates.\nNon-advertising revenue at\nYahoo rose 40%, although it\nstill remained a small share\nof the total. Yahoo\u2019s fees for\nits premium offerings, such\nas broadband services bundled with high-speed internet\naccess, climbed 52% to $129\nmillion. Yahoo claims a client\nbase of 8.4 million fee-paying\ncustomers at the end of the\nquarter, compared with 7.6\nmillion in the third quarter.\nRevenue from listings, such\nas help-wanted ads, also rose\n15% to $38 million. Yahoo\u2019s\ninternational revenue, outside of its US home, surged to\n$303 million. At 28% of sales,\nthat revenue represented the\nsame portion of sales as in\nthe third quarter.\nNokia 7260: stiff competition for Motorola Inc\n\n"

Complaints to\nBUSA and cock-ups with fax\nmachines resulted in us having to rematch at the neutral\nground of UCL. In order to\npatch up the King\u2019s-IC rela-tion, a men\u2019s friendly was\norganised for the same time.\nThings did not get off to the\nbest of starts when we turned\nup at Shenley and none of the\ngroundsmen knew that we\nwerecoming.Luckilytheyhad\none pitch already set up and\nso the girls could play their\nBUSA match. Unfortunately,\nthe boys had to make do with\na football pitch.\nThe King\u2019s mixed team had\nthrashed us last term and we\nhad no idea of the standard\nof their ladies\u2019 team, so no\nexcuses were accepted for\nabsence. The umpire seemed\nslightly confused by our decision to play boundaries but\nno restraining lines, but it\nsuited all the oldies in our\nteam just fine. Imperial won\nthe toss (or hide the whistle\nas it seems to have become...)\nand we opted to shoot uphill\nfor the first half. I have to\nsay that personally I have\nnever, ever been more nervous at the start of a Lacrosse\nmatch \u2013 we are in with a\nstrong chance of winning the\nleague and everybody wanted\nrevenge for King\u2019s previous\nwhinging and general skul-duggery.\nJeanette won the first draw\nand the ball was swiftly taken\ndown to King\u2019s end (for some\nbizarre reason their goalie\nwasn\u2019t yet on the pitch) but\nsome good defending from\nthem sent it back up the other\nway. Imperial were solid with\nAnnie at Point and Sabrina at\nCover, yet swift with Hannah\nC and Mary defending on the\nwing (like a battering ram on\ngreased weasel shit).\nIt was initially a bit sticky\naround midfield, but Caroline\nwent on one of her trademark\nmad dashes and shot a peach\nof a goal. That seemed to spur\nthe rest of Imperial\u2019s goals-coring machine into action\nand two more goals quickly\nfollowed. After some substitutions (eating my own weight\nin mince pies over Christmas\nmay not have been the best\nidea) the goals kept coming.\nThe boys, by this point, had\ngone off to have a men\u2019s training session and mini match.\nIt was quite amusing watching the fear in their eyes as\nthe King\u2019s men \u2018kitted up\u2019 in\nhelmets and pads... but back\nto the ladies\u2019 game.\nA momentary lack in concentration from the defence\nallowed King\u2019s to sneak\none in, which was a bit of\na shame; their side of the\numpire\u2019s card was so lovely\nand clear.\nHalf time came and it was\n8-1 to Imperial. Doing our\nbest not to get too excited\nand with only minimal\nsquealing, we regrouped to\ndiscuss tactics. Wise words\nwere spoken (\u201cif we can get\neight goals in one half so can\nthey\u201d, \u201cplay as if it is 0-0\u201d,\n\u201cwe\u2019ve really pissed them\noff now\u201d) but couldn\u2019t dispel the glee that we were all\nfeeling. Consequently, when\nwe got back on the pitch we\nwere not together and Kings\nquickly scored. This was not\npart of the plan. Nor was\nthem scoring another goal,\nquite controversially \u2013 even\nsome King\u2019s players thought\nit didn\u2019t go in, a couple of\nminutes later.\nIt brought us back to earth\nwith a bump and our play\npicked up again. Caroline,\nMary, Jeanette our goalscorers were numerous... and Ms\nHannah Readman was on fire\nwith a couple of really sneaky\nunderarm shots. Being in\ndefence for Imperial was\nslightly boring in the second\npart of this half \u2013 all of the\nplay was at the other end.\nWatching one of the King\u2019s\nplayers making a run and\nshooting at her own goal was\nquite amusing though.\nKing\u2019s last goal of the match\nwas again controversial: one\nof their players steamed down\nthe pitch \u2018through\u2019 Hannah C\nto score. The umpire allowed\nthe goal to stand even though\nthe scorer had smacked\nHannah in the face as she\nshot, causing Hannah to bite\nthrough her lip. Thank goodness for gumshields.\nThe match ended 17-4 to\nus \u2013 they should have settled\nfor a walkover after all. We\nwere just finishing the usual\njolly hockey sticks hurrahing and hand shaking when\nTim came over and told us\nthat one of the King\u2019s boys\nhad broken his collar bone, so\nwould Annie mind (as most\nsenior medic) coming and\ntaking a look at him. Whoops.\nStill, I think that generally a\nfine day was had by all.\nYoung, cold and in with a chance of winning the league: Imperial\u2019s women\u2019s lacrosse team\nThanks and apologies to Alex Khalifa, who pointed out the mistake in last week\u2019s Quick Crossword.\nThe answers were meant to be \u2018Theorems\u2019 and \u2018Tramp\u2019, but they didn\u2019t intersect properly. Sorry!\nLACROSSE\n\n"

No, really. Take off both\nshoes (and socks), then jump\n(yes, jump) onto the ball.\nNow, try and stay on. Keep\nyour feet moving, your eyes\nfixed on a reference point on\nthe wall, and a very strong\nbelief in whichever God you\nbelieve in.\nThis can be mastered relatively quickly, hence the need\nto make life more difficult. A\nrunning mount (where you\ntake a run up, leap and pray),\na static jump (where you bend\nyour knees, jump and pray)\nand handstands (don\u2019t ever\nstop praying) are all possible.\nAs mentioned before, this\nis actually much easier than\nit looks.\nHere are our step-by-step\ninstructions:\nFirstly, take your shoes\noff. Place your shoes near\nthe window where they are\nunlikely to offend people.\nPlacing them out of the window is necessary in a small\nnumber of cases.\nPlace your left foot on the\ntop of the ball, and step onto\nit [see picture 1, right]. As\nyou step, the ball will rotate\nslightly \u2013 put your other foot\non it to stop it rotating too\nfar. At this stage, it helps to\nhave a friend who stands\nbehind you ready to break\nyour fall [see picture 2]. They\nshould stand behind rather\nthan in front, as you can catch\nyourself when you fall for-wards.\nKeep your feet moving! This\nmakes it easier to stay on\nbalance \u2013 do tiny little steps\neach time [see picture 3]. If\nyou feel yourself going off bal-ance, jump off \u2013 you\u2019re going\ndown anyway, so you might\nas well avoid landing on your\narse. Keep your eyes fixed on\na spot on the wall as it will\nhelp you keep your balance.\nOf course, anything you\ncan do on terra firma can\nbe done on a ball (although\nsome things may require\nhasty adaptation and a superhuman sense of balance). We\nsuggest juggling three balls\nto start showing off properly\n[see picture 4]. Once you can\ndo that, try keeping your feet\nstill. Then try jumping. Then\ntry only one leg. When you\u2019re\nout of Casualty, tell us how\nwonderful you are by emailing juggling@ic.ac.uk. We\nmeet every Tuesday evening\nand have all sorts of weird\nand wonderful toys to play\nwith, not just the usual balls,\nclubs and the like. Please\ncome along \u2013 email us for\ndetails.\n\u25cf Next week:\nEPISODE TWO:\nNUNCHUCKS\nJUGGLING CLUB\nTen things I can do that you can\u2019t\nEPISODE ONE: The big red ball\n1. Put your foot on the ball, and step onto it, 2. Position a friend behind you, to prevent accidents such as this,\n3. Take little steps and keep your balance, 4. Show off!\n1 2\n3 4\nBy Anup Sinha\nIn the last two weeks, we\nhave had more convincing\nwins for the two Imperial\nChess teams: 6\u00bd\u20131\u00bd against\nWest London and 8-0 against\nWillesden & Brent in the\nMiddlesex League, and 5\u00bd\n\u2013\u00bd against SOAS and City\nin the ULU League. Having\nlost only one match this sea-son, both the Imperial teams\nremain hot favourites to win\ntheir respective leagues.\nWe pitted our wits against\nDr Jonathan Mestel, of the\nmaths department, in the\nannual grandmaster challenge on Monday.\nOn Wednesday 2 February,\nwe will arrange a blitz tournament where each player has\n10 minutes on the clock. The\ntournament is free to enter\nfor club members, with a\nprize of \u00a310 to be won. Email\nchess@ic.ac.uk if you are\ninterested.\nAgainst SOAS and City,\nFelix Balthasar, Robin Nandi,\nYiannis Phinikettos and\nBeinan Liu performed well\nto win both the matches they\nplayed.\nIn the Middlesex League,\nWest London had fielded\nstrong players in their team.\nBut Richard Thursby, Slava\nBurenkov, Moritz Reuter,\nPeter Levermore and Kanwal\nBhatia proved to be too strong\nfor their opponents. Anup\nSinha beat his opponent in\nan interesting and tense fin-ish. Willesden & Brent could\nnot provide any resistance\nagainst the Imperial team.\nA few of the Chess\nCommittee\u2019s responsibilities\ninclude:\n1. Organising all matches\n\u2013 we are now firm favourites\nfor the first ever season to\nwin both the leagues simul-taneously.\n2. The Grandmaster\nChallenge, as mentioned\nabove.\n3. A tournament against\nOxford and Cambridge is in\nthe process of being organ-ised. Cambridge have agreed\nto play us in a few weeks\u2019\ntime.\n4. Organising the chess trip\nto Greece in the summer.\n5. Other mini tournaments.\nThe latest addition will be\nthe game where you play\nexchange chess. Do you know\nwhat I\u2019m talking about? This\nis a fun game of chess, which\nrequires deep and quick thinking plus team work... you play\nin pairs! If you want to find\nout more, why not take part\nin the tournament for free\nand win prizes? Just email\nchess@ic.ac.uk.\n6. Many more events: just\nbecome a member of the club\nand find out about them.

I do not\nwish to enter into a tit for tat corre-spondence, but I feel it is only right\nto correct the false impression given\nby the letter.\nI understand that the facts of the\ncase are these:\nTwo people (members of the pub-lic) separately rang for an ambulance before Sherfield Control were\ncontacted.\nSherfield Control was informed at\n16.15 and immediately responded.\nThe individual concerned had been\nhaving an epileptic fit. By the time\nthe officers arrived, the fit was over\nand the student was back on his feet.\n(None of our officers were present\nwhen the fit was taking place).\nThe correct treatment in these\ncases (endorsed by the Ambulance\nService) is for any obstructions to\nbe cleared around the patient and\nfor no intervention to be made until\nthe fit is over.\nTwo ambulances, called by members of the public, arrived at 16.20\nand 16.25 and the student was taken\nto ChelseaandWestminsterHospital\nfor a check up.\nThe Security Guards who respond\nin the event of an emergency call\nare all fully trained in First Aid. 29 of\nthem have also been trained in the\nuse of a Defibrillator.\nIt is totally incorrect and irresponsible of the letter writer to imply\notherwise. I cannot, obviously, comment on the capability of the medical students around.\nAs I say, I do not want to create\na mountain out of a mole hill here,\nbut I do think it is important that\nSecurity have the support and confidence of the Students Union.\nRegards\nDiana Pinn\nAssistant Director of Estates\n(Services & Administration)\n\u2018Atheism\u2019 posters\nDear Editor,\nI would like to voice my total support\nfor whoever it was that responded to\nthe atheism posters last week.\nThe \u2018Life\u2019 group at Imperial, a\nChristian club, had put up posters\nsaying \u201cAtheism: the fashionable\nworld view that can\u2019t deliver\u201d.\nIn due time, posters in the same\nstyle but saying \u201cFreethinking: the\nsensible world view that delivers\u201d\nappeared. (Apologies if the words\naren\u2019t exactly right.)\nThis simple lampoon is the first\nact I\u2019ve seen which bucks a trend\nthat\u2019s passed unnoticed for a while\nnow.\nThe clubs \u2013 especially the numerous Christian ones \u2013 blanket poster\nthe campus advertising their events,\nhoping that they can make some of\nthe students pray/prey.\nLast term, I saw one student\nat Imperial preaching outside\nBoots on Kensington High Street.\nUnbelievable.\nImperial is a science university,\nand such open displaying of religious activities gives us a farcical\nappearance. For posters at Imperial\nto suggest atheism is a bad idea is\nabsolutely crazy.\nYours,\nName and department supplied\nExam anguish and term dates\nDear Sir,\nIn response to Tim Weinert-Aplin\u2019s\nletter I feel I must express my support for the action of Sam Rorke, as\nmy Deputy President (Education &\nWelfare).\nThe Union does not have a \u201cbumbling inability to see into the future\u201d.\nSam was correct to point out that\nterm dates are set (provisionally)\nten years in advance and confirmed\ntwo years in advance. Last year,\nafter a particularly late start of session (which caused problems with\nthe autumn term starting at the\nsame time as the ULU/BUSA sports\nseason and ending too close to\nChristmas) I checked the term dates\nfor the next nine years and made\nsure that they were all reasonable \u2013\na couple of changes were made and\nthese went through Senate without\nanyone noticing. I couldn\u2019t do anything about this year\u2019s term dates as\nthey had already been confirmed.\nI should point out, however, that\nsometimes the calendar just causes\nproblems. The main issue is Easter\nwhich is the only Christian holiday,\nthat is based on a lunar date calcula-tion. I can\u2019t remember the exact formula off-hand but it\u2019s basically the\nSunday following the Paschal Full\nMoon (put \u201cEaster date calculation\u201d\nin Google if you are interested). This\nmeans that the date of Easter moves\naround, with a maximum variance\nof 33 days! Sometimes Easter is\n\u201cearly\u201d and sometimes it is \u201clate\u201d\nin our, solar based, calendar. This\nmeans that the Academic Registrar\nhas a very difficult task trying to\nbalance the length of the Christmas\nholiday with that of the Easter one.\nSometimes one or both is going to\nhave to be curtailed. The next major\nupset will be 2008/2009.\nAs to exams around Christmas,\nthat\u2019s really left to departments\n(and so the student view should be\na on a per department basis). My\nold department always took the view\n(endorsed by the staff student com-mittee) that it was much better to\nhave exams before Christmas so as\nnot to ruin the holiday. Other departments (again with the students\u2019\nagreement) have decided that it\u2019s\nbetter to give the students a longer\nchance to revise. There is no right or\nwrong answer as to how much revision time is needed and the views\nof students on a particular course\ncan change from year to year. Sam\nshould not be imposing one view\nor another on departments. That is\nwhy departmental and course student reps are so important.\n\u201cThe Union\u201d is not just the sabbat-icals. Dep Reps are union officers\ntoo and it is primarily their responsibility to sort problems in individual departments. Ultimately Sam\u2019s\n(and my) responsibility is to help\nthem represent their students not to\nassume we know what students on\neach course want. Dep Reps should\nactively look at timetables and get\nproblems sorted (I always did when\nI was ISE Dep Rep). We don\u2019t get\ndetails of departmental timetabling\nany earlier than they do \u2013 and we\ncannot understand the consequences for the students as well as they\ncan themselves.\nI\u2019m sorry Tim didn\u2019t get a personal\nreply from Sam but all the sabbaticals do get a lot of email and Sam\u2019s\ninbox was very full of disaffected\nAero students \u2013 it is not too surprising that one or two didn\u2019t get a reply.\nThe important thing is that Sam was\nable to help the departmental reps\nwhen it was clear that the students,\nin that department, were not happy\nwith that department\u2019s exam dates.\nKind regards,\nMustafa Arif\nPresident\nImperial College Union\nThe dodgy dollar\nDear Sir,\nNumaan Chaudhry missed out one\nimportant reason why the dollar will\nnot collapse as it should. Petroleum\nis traded in dollars and that accounts\nfor 40% of the world\u2019s trade so therefore there will always be a demand\nfor the dollar regardless of the US\u2019s\nown balance of payments deficit.\nOnly one country has ever tried to\ntrade oil in another currency (the\nEuro), Iraq, and look what happened\nthere.\nYours faithfully,\nNicholas Royall\nMaterials Dept staff member\nLetters to the Editor\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk by 10pm Monday. This is the page where you can make your voice heard on just about\nany topic. Letters may be edited for length but not for spelling or grammar, and are printed at the Editor\u2019s discretion\nThe silly season has come and gone.\nCome February, only the bull-head-edly determined few can adhere to\ntheir ridiculously ambitious New\nYear\u2019s resolutions. The mere mortals among us should take it upon\nourselves to commit one act of altruism this year; and what better than\nan act which some of us, as future\ndoctors, are intrinsically linked to\n\u2013 the donation of blood?\nThe number of people needing\nblood and its components is rising\nat an ever-increasing rate. One in\nfive surgical procedures requires\nfive units of blood to be transfused.\nWith older people requiring more\nsurgery, and the short shelf-life (five\nweeks) of blood components making\nit difficult to stockpile, more donations are required.\nBlood is an essential commodity,\nused to treat those with blood component defects, immune deficiencies and cancers of the blood on a\nregular basis, along with road traffic\naccident and shock victims. Thus,\nsomebody you know, perhaps your-self, may unexpectedly be needing\nwhole or partial blood donations.\nWe all expect blood to be there for\nus, but barely a fraction of those who\ncan give actually do. Five per cent of\nthe UK population are regular blood\ndonors, donating the three million\nunits currently used on an annual\nbasis. However, current demograph-ics, with an ageing population, indicate the number of people available\nto donate, aged 17-70, is decreasing\nby 17% each year.\nConclusively, it is up to healthy\npeople, preferably from the younger\nage groups, to take just two hours\nout of their schedules this year,\nto donate the vital pint that could\nsave another\u2019s life. The West End\nDonor Centre, located on Margaret\nSt, London W1 (nearest tube\nOxford Circus), is open from 8am to\n7.30pm on weekdays. Call 08457\n711 711 now to pre-book your next\nappointment.\nMake a difference this year. Visit\nwww.blood.co.uk for further details.\nMake a difference in two hours\nSajini Wijetilleka encourages you to give blood and help save lives\nNew look website launched today\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nThe online student newspaper for Imperial College\n\n"
