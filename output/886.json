    "content": "NEWS\nCollege Day: Referendum Result Students rejected the proposed change to\nthe College Day in yesterday's referendum. Out of the 517 who voted, in\nthe Student's Union poll on Monday and\nTuesday this week, 457 said that they\nwere against changes and only 59 agreed\nwith the proposal. There was one spoilt\npaper.\nIt has been proposed by a Working Party, chaired by Professor Alan Swanson, that the College Day be\nextended from 9.00am to 6.00pm. This is\nto cope with timetabling problems,\nparticularly in the final years.\nVarious questions have arisen from the\nproposal, particularly those of increased\ncost to the College. A longer day would\nlead to increased overheads, such as\npower consumption and staff wages.\nThere is no financial advisor on the\nWorking Party, and no-one is prepared to\nconfirm where the extra finance will\nemerge from.\nThe possibility of staff such as cleaners\nand security having to arrive in College\nearlier has also been considered. Mr\nReeves, Chief Security Officer, seemed\nconfident of the staff's ability to cover a longer day. Security provide cover for all\n24 hours and messengers already work\n9.00am to 6.00pm, covering 7.00am to\n9.00am on overtime. Departments are\nopened at 7.00am regardless, as are the\ncar parks and so would be affected by an\nearlier start. However, his deputy, Mr Briley, thought that the day 'would affect\nLinstead Hall Christmas Bash\n7.30pm Saturday 8th December\n2 Bands, Disco, Bar Extension...\nAdmission:\nLinstead Free\nEx - Linsteadians 50p Guests \u00a31.00\nSTRICTLY NO ADMISSION AFTER 10PM working arrangements' and that it was 'a matter we're keeping clear of at present.'\nThe Party hope to be able to alter\ncleaning schedules so that the cleaners\nwill not have to arrive any earlier. This\nwill avoid the possibility of them having\nto travel before the first tubes, or\ndisturbing early starters. The Rector, Sir\nEric Ash, and Mr Angus Fraser, College\nDirector, were both unavailable for\ncomment.\nIf the proposals are implemented by the\nCollege, then the clubs and societies of\nthe Student's Union will have problems\nwith running meetings. Many students\nwill not be able to attend meetings if\ntheir department is running along an\nopposing timetable to that of the clubs.\nSmall Ads\n\u2022 Help!

    "content": "Wednesday 5th December\nIssue Number 886\nAndy Butcher (right) celebrates his win in the Felix editor elections in the Union Bar last night.\nNon Sabbatical Felix Editor Elected In the election for the Non-Sabbatical\nFelix Editor Andy Butcher was returned\nthe winner against New Election. When asked how it felt he said that it 'Hasn't sunk in yet' and he would get used to the\nidea in time.\nThe election was called after nobody\nstood for the post of Sabbatical Editor at\nthe beginning of the term. That election\nwas run due to the failure of the elected\ncandidate in last years vote for all the\nsabbatical posts.\nDespite the poll being run in\nconjunction with the Union's referendum\non the College Day there was a poor turn\nout all round. Out of the 517 who voted\non the College Day only 450 voted in the\nelection. Andy Butcher gained 300 votes\nwith New Election taking 78 votes. There\nwere also 72 spoilt papers.\nThe result means that from next term\nFelix will have a full Editor controlling\nthe paper as opposed to it being run by\nthe Union Print Unit Production Manager,\nChris Stapleton. In this way FELIX regains\ncomplete editorial freedom. Chris\nStapleton commented that 'It's a good job\nthat we don't have to have another\nelection. From January FELIX will be\nable to have un - restricted comment\nfrom it's boss on the Union as well as\nCollege, something that I haven't been\nallowed to do.'\nThe newly elected editor will receive\nan e qui ve lent of two terms rent in\nSouthside for doing the job, which is\nequivalent to the honoraria that aCC U president receives. For this he will take\nover the complete running of Felix,\nalthough this will involve much lias on with the Print Unit Manager, over the\nproduction of the magazine.\n\n"
