    "content": "reviews\nby\nAdrian\nBourne\noo50 The McLaren domination of last\nSunday's San Marino Grand Prix was\nquite remarkable in what is really a transitional year for the team and\nFormula One. Ayrton Senna's win (as\npredicted last week) puts real pressure\non Alain Prost as they head for Monte\nCarlo on May 15th. Between them\nProst and Senna have won the last five\nMonaco Grand Prix and it should be\na fascinating struggle. More next\nweek on that.\nThe two most important races this\nweekend are rounds of the SportsPrototypes World Championship\n(SPWC) and F3000 International\nChampionship.\nFor the SPWC teams Sunday's Autosport 1000 teams at Silverstone\n(on the A43 between Brackley and\nTowcester in Northamptonshire)\nrepresents the last chance to get in\nsome serious racing miles before the\nLe Mans 24 hour classic next month.\nThe series so far has turned out to\nbe a battle between the Tom\nWalcinshaw Racing Jaguar XJR-9's and the sole Sauber-Mercedes C9.\nThe leading Jaguar of American\nGrand Prix driver Eddie Cheever and\nformer British GP driver Martin\nBrundle has won the last two rounds\nof the championship at Monza, Italy\nand Jarama, Spain but trails in the\nchampionship, 25 points behind\nSauber drivers Jean-Louis Schlezzer\nand Mauro Baldi who won the first\nround at Jerez, Spain and finished\nsecond in the other two races. Also\nappearing at Le Mans, but not\nSilverstone, will be the factory\nPorsche team, with last year's winning trio of drivers: Derek Bell,\nHans Stuck and Al Holbert. Jaguar\nhave spared no expense to end\nPorsche's domination, entering five\ncars for Le Mans. One of Jaguar's fifteen drivers for the race (three per\ncar) will be 1986 British Formula\nThree Champion Andy Wallace. On\nSunday Andy will be driving his Ratt\nRT22 in the second round of the\nF3000 International series at\nVallelunga, Italy. The first round at\nJerez saw debut victory for both\nJohnny Herbert and the Reynard\nchassis. Second through to fifth were\nLola T88/50S, designed in\nHuntingdon by IC graduate Mark\nWilliams. 28 year old Mark\ncompleted his degree in Mechanical\nEngineering in 1980 and, having been\ninterested in motor racing design\nsince the age of ten, decided to look\nfor a job in the field. The College\ncareers service were less than\nsupportive, advising Mark to 'get a proper job instead'. He obliged by\ngoing to work for a firm of consulting\nengineers but successfully applied for\na job at Lola Cars in 1983. After\nworking on cars for the American\n'Indycar' series Mark took over\nresponsibility for F3000 in 1985,\ndesigning the T950, which was a bit\ntoo slow to win any races. The\nT86/50 and T87/50 won races in 1986\nand 1987 but both times the\nchampionship was lost to arch rivals\nMarch. This year appears to be better\nnews for Mark and Lola as the\nMarches were considerably off the\npace at Jerez. Lola should have the\nstrength in depth to beat Reynard over\nthe season and my favourites for the\ntitle are the French GBDA team, who\nare planning to enter Formula One\nnext year, and will want to progress\nwith style. Next week: Monaco GP\npreview and the start of the build up\nto the world's biggest sporting event.\nAdrian\nGrainger\nIt is the last Saturday of the football\nseason when things used to be usually\nbe decided. But with these play-off\nnightmares, some teams have three\nweeks to sweat it out.\nChelsea v Charlton\nStamford Bdg (Fulham Bdy tube)\nThis is it. The crunch battle to end all\nbattles. The fixtures computer must\nbe laughing its little chips off. The\nstate of the teams is simple. A draw\nor win for Charlton equals safety. A win only for Chelsea gives them\nsecurity. Any opposite results puts the\nother team in the play-off position\nwith third, fourth and fifth teams of\nDivision Two. Chelsea were\ndemolished at West Ham last week\nand looked a poor and desperate side.\nCharlton drew with Spurs to equal\nChelsea's41 point total, thanks to an\nequal ising penalty and mostly feel\nconfident. This should be a classic but\nmight end up as a war. A neutral\nwould love the amo sphere, so be there\nor be square. I predict a draw and\ndisaster for Chelsea.\nCrystal Palace v Manchester City\nSelhurst Park (Selhurst BR)\nThis is a crucial game for the home\nteam. Palace have had a great year but\ncould still miss out on even a playoff place. They lost to Leeds last week\nbut also beat Blackburn to keep up a challenge. They must win here and\nhope that Blackburn don't win their\nlast game. If they finish fifth, they\ncould be playing Charlton in the play-offs, a home, I mean away game, well\nactually it is the same! Man City are\na good young side and I will tip them\nto win this league next year. Players\nlike Lake, Redmond and Stewart are\nstars of the future and hold the key\nfor light blue success. Palace should\nwin this, but it will be close.\nMillwall v Blackburn\nThe Den (New Cross tube)\nCongratulations to the Lions on\nachieving a place in the top flight for\nthe very first time. They have won the\ntitle as well, so this all looks well for\nthe future among the big boys. The\nvictory at Hull last week was\nwitnessed by many thousands of\nMillwall fans and they should turn out\nin force to greet their favourites.\nBlackburn, as I have said, are in a tussle, with Crystal Palace, so\nMillwall could do their London\nneighbours a favour here. Archibald\nwas absent last week and they could\nonly draw at home with lowly\nReading. I predict a home win and the\npossible end of the Blackburn dream.\nBrentford v York\nA Division Three game of no real\npromotion or relegation relevance.\nLeyton Orient v Wolves\nBrisbane Road (Leyton tube)\nYet another make or break match in\nthis lower division matching. Orient\nmust win to confirm a place in the\nplay-offs and the real chance of a deserved Division Three place next\nyear. Frank Clark must be hoping for\nthe best possible performance.\nWolves are champions. They have\ncompleted the first leg of their climb\nback to the top flight which I think\nthey will attain eventually. Steve Bull\nhas scored over 50 goals for them this\nyear and his successes cannot be\npraised highly enough. Wolves fans\nhave dubious reputations but they\ndeserve the success that the team has\nprovided. I will go for a hard-fought\ndraw.\nAll games are on May 7 (Saturday)\nwith 3pm kick-offs.\nGame of the Day: Chelsea v Charlton (go along to this one if you\ncan afford the time).\nONE WEEK TO THE\nCUP FINAL!!\nBye for now,\nAdrian Grainger\nThe\nz<3* Royal School of\nH< SM\nMines Journal\n1988\nThe RS MJ(1988 edition) will be\nprinted in June this year.

It is\nentirely due to these six tireless\nindividuals that we were able to bring\nout our flysheet yesterday morning.\nCheers!\nSecrets, secrets\nI would have liked to have brought\nyou up-to-date on much more\ninformation regarding the Union\nSnack Bar and Bar Staff in this issue.\nMany important decisions have been\ntaken since our flysheet was brought\nout yesterday but the Union Executive\nhave decided not to release any\ninformation until later this morning.\nI fully understand the need to inform\nthose directly concerned before the\npress. For this reason I will probably\nbe bringing out another flysheet next\nweek if there are anymore\ndevelopments.\nKeys\nI am becoming increasingly\nconcerned by the number of people\nin this College who have collections\nof master keys from all over the\ncampus.

I'd be quite interested to know where you get\nyour information from. It's quite obvious from your letter\nthat you could not have attended any of the CU meetings\nthat I 've been to. Like an 'extreme left-wing party', with\n'pressure to conform'! Maybe you refer to the 'statement\nof faith' that voting members are asked to sign. Most\nevangelical Christians should have no problem agreeing\nwith it, and it ensures continuity over the years. Without\nit may be like giving over an art gallery to be run by a group of Philistines; its content would soon cease to reflect\nits name.\nI have used the term 'evangelical Christian'\npurposefully; I agree with your point that 'Christian\nUnion' is a misleading name. This is being looked into,\nand will hopefully result in its amendment. I don't quite\nsee how this lends itself to such a bitter attack on the CU\nbody as a whole though.\nThere's an open door at all CU meetings and Bible\nstudies, all are welcome, only voting membership is\nrestricted as above. Should you attend such a Bible study,\nyou will discover that discussions are free and open.\nThere's certainly no pressure to believe anything. People\nshare their views of scripture, basing their thoughts on\nthe word of God, not on feelings of tradition. You see,\nas evangelical Christians, we believe that the Bible records\nthe word of God, and so we look to it, through God's spirit, for written guidance and authority. Tradition relies\nupon handing down the key and important aspects of\nChristianity from generation to generation. Both of these\nbeliefs have potential pitfalls. The former\nmisinterpretation, the latter\u2014a small deviation from the\ncorrect path some time ago can result in a large deviation\nnow. Evangelically, misinterpretation can be reduced in\nthe light of what the Bible says as a whole. This provides\na firm foundation from which we can understand more\nof the character of God, and learn how to live lives\npleasing to him.\nYou inferred that quotation from the epistles wasn't good\nenough, and that Christ's own words were ignored in\nprevious replies. Isn't this somewhat naive? Have you ever\nread the epistles? Evidently not very thoroughly as you\nconsider them only to give advice about Jewish laws on\ndiet and circumcision. I agree that these things are written\nabout, but along with many other important issues. The\nCorenthians, for example, needed correcting because they\ntook the freedom aspect of Christianity too far, in that\nthey were causing other, easily-led people to\nmisunderstand the true nature and purposes of God. This\nis that God, through his Son, wants to know everyone\npersonally; helping them, by his Spirit, to live lives\npleasing to Him, and consequently helpful to others here\non earth. Jesus said that 'I am the way, the truth and the\nlifer No one comes to the Father except through me'. He\nalso says (in Matt 7:21 ;23) that not everyone who says\nto Him 'Lord, Lord' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven.\nHe says this about those who do things which look Holy\nand Righteous on the outside, but inside are dead-unknown to God. The Pharasees, for example, were wrong\nin that they thought they would keep the Mosaic Law, and\nforget about their friendship with God, and in this way\nattain salvation.

    "content": "Is depression getting you down?\nSummer Term is\nupon us and for\nmost the dreaded\nexams are once\nagain a reality.\nMany students get\nthe 'blues' now\nagain about their\ncourse, lack of\nrevision, personal\nlife or financial\nworries. We feel\nmiserable, head-achy, irritable,\nconstantly tired and\nmay not even want\nto get out of bed.\nUsually these\nmoods pass, but in\nsome the phase gets\nworse. That's when\nthere's a danger of\nsinking into\ndepression.\nThe word 'depression', used by most\nin its loosest form to mean run down\nand sad, really means a series of very\nintense feelings ranging from being\ndown-hearted to utter hopelessness\nand despair.\nA severe depression can be\ndangerous. Once a person passes the\npoint of caring what happens to them,\nthey become apathetic and disregard\nall advice. The depression can disrupt\nthe sufferer's life leaving them unable\nto study, attend lectures or even leave\ntheir rooms. They can be full of self-pity, agitated, unkempt and, in\nextreme cases, talk of suicide.\nDepression only becomes an illness\nwhen it goes on for an extended time\nand begins to swamp all other\nfeelings. In Britain, depressive illness\noccurs in several million people at\nleast once during their lives. It can\noccur in anyone at any age but\nstudents are particularly susceptible\nto the pressures of academic life and\nliving on a student grant. Female\nstudents are more likely to seek\nmedical advice for depression,\nwhereas research has shown that men\ntend to 'hide' their symptoms behind\nillness, anti-social behaviour and\nalcohol.\nThere are two types of depression:\nreactive (non-biological) and\nendo gene o us( biological) depressions.\nReactive depression is an\noverwhelming reaction to external\nconditions which is the prevalent form\nat this time of year. Endogeneous\ndepression results from biochemical\nchanges within the brain and is\nusually independent of environmental\nfactors.\nThere are many symptoms of\ndepression. They range from sleep\ndisturbances, appetite loss or\nincreased eating, mood changes\nthroughout each day, lack of sex\ndrive, lack of concentration, loss of\nenergy, loss of interest in anything\nimportant, low self-esteem, morbid\nthoughts and hypochondria.\nMany of us have certainly felt all\nof these symptoms at some time but\ncould you recognise whether your\ndepression is just mild and short-lived\nor becoming a depressive illness?\nThe depression is only an illness\nwhen the symptoms start to control\nyour life. If you recognise all the\nsymptoms in yourself, try to think\nback to when you first began to feel\nthem. Then find a friend who you can\ntrust and who you know will listen to\nyou. Tell them everything.\nThis may help you to sort out your\nproblems by giving a different\nperspective to the situation. If you feel\nthere is nobody who will listen\nsympathetically, then give Nightline\na ring. Not only do they provide\ninformation on all aspects of being a student in London, but they have\npeople who are prepared to listen and\ngive good advice. Alternatively there\nis the Student Counsellor, Don\nAdlington, who is available during\noffice hours. You can also try to\nalleviate your symptoms in several\nways: make plans for fun, buy\nyourself a treat or listen to some\nmusic, exercise\u2014physical exertion\nmakes both your body and mind feel\nbetter and learn to relax. These may\nseem reckless when you've got exams\nnext week but you'll find you'll get\nso much more achieved if you can\npull yourself out of the depression\nNOW.\nMany depressions disappear\nspontaneously, but if none of the self-help actions work then you should go\nstraight to your doctor. Don't be\nafraid that he will brush you off just\nbecause your illness isn'tp nys ical. Every doctor sees at least one person\na day with depression or anxiety. Just\nremember that depression isn't mental\nillness.\nWhen you see your doctor,\ndescribe all your symptoms and the\npossible causes. He will probably give\nyou a brief physical examination to\nput your mind at rest about any\nphysical symptoms. He will then\neither refer you to a clinical\npy s cho logi st or prescribe antidepressant medication. Sometimes\neven both.\nIf he believes that you are just overanxious about your exams rather than\ndepressed, he may prescribe\ntr an quli ll is ers. If you are feeling down and it is\nreally going to effect your exam\nperformance, talk to someone now.\nThe important decisions you should\nbe taking will be depressed decisions\nand not the normal decisions you\nwould make. If you don't confront\nyour life and you let the symptoms\ntake over then you can wreck your\ndegree, your future career and,\nultimately, your life.\nii it iii iii imi iii imi/\\ You can 'phone NIGHTLINE, or call in, all\nthrough the night and talk about anything,\nupsetting or otherwise, in complete confidence.\nNIGHTLINE open 6pm to 8am5812468 or call at 9, Princes Gardens, SW7\nFELIX Friday 6th May 1988 9\n\n"

    "content": "UNDER lB L THE MICRORJSCOPE\nby Steve Black\nWhy cats have\nnine lives\nOne of the problems with scientists\nis that they tend to study only those\nproblems that are easy to study. So\nthey tend to neglect things like old-wives-tales as unworthy of their\nconsideration. 'Cats have nine lives'\nis rejected as a scientific proposition\nbecause it doesn't even seem to make\nlogical sense. But, every now and\nthen some brave soul sets out to\ninvestigate the truth behind such folk-knowledge. Two New York vets have\njust applied science to our folk\nknowledge about cats.\nNew York is a good place to study\ncat's relative number of lives since\nthere are a large number of multi-storey apartment complexes and\ntherefore a wide range of distances for\ncats to fall. Conveniently people also\nfall from these windows so\ncomparisons of the mortality rate can\nbe made.\nIf you look at plots of injuries and\ndeaths versus distance of fall then the\ndifferences between people and cats\nbecome really obvious. People never\nsurvived falls when they fell more\nthan seven stories onto concrete. But\nonly about one in nine cats falling less\nthan 15 stories actually died (note the\ninteresting ratio). Strangely, the\nnumber of injuries and deaths peaks\nat about 6 stories for cats: those\nfalling more than 6 floors had fewer\ninjuries.\nSome of these facts have obvious\nexplanations. People reach a terminal\nvelocity of about 120 miles per hour\nafter falling about 6 or 7 stories. Few\nsurvive an impact with concrete at\nthat speed. Cats have a higher surface\narea to mass ratio and therefore reach\na terminal velocity of only 60mph after about six stories. Cats also land\nbetter than people: they are able to\ntwist rapidly into a position with all\nfour legs facing the ground. People\ntend to flail about aimlessly and while\nthey may land on their feet they will\ndo so un tidily: this does nothing for\ntheir chances of survival. Human\nbabies a parent ly tend to land on their\nheads (though how the authors of the\nstudy managed to find examples of\nbabies dropping out of tall buildings\nis beyond me). Cats dissipate the\nenergy impact over all four limbs and\nthis does wonders for their\nsur viv ability. There even appears to be a sensible\nexplanation for the mysterious peak\nin the feline morality rate at drops of\n7 stories. Apparently cats relax once\nthey have stopped accelerating (they\nreach terminal velocity at about six\nor seven floors). When they relax,\ntheir muscles are not so tense and they\ntend to hold their legs out\nhorizontally. This increases their air\nresistance, slows them down and also\nprovides a better impact position:\nrelaxed bent limbs dissipate the\nenergy better than rigid straight ones\n(this is what parachutists are taught).\nSo cats falling more than seven floors\nare more likely to survive.\nSo there you have it: not all old\nwives tales are nonsense. Cats are\nmore likely to survive falls than\npeople. Folk wisdom even got the\nratio right: cats are about nine times\nmore likely to survive than we are.\nThe only thing science has failed to\ncome up with is an explanation of why\nso many cats and people throw\nthemselves from high buildings in\nNew York.\nBetter than\nscience fiction\nScience fiction only rarely produces\nreally believable alien monsters. Even\nwhen it does, few of the creatures are\nas unusual as the strange beastie s that\ninhabit Earth's extremities (deep sea\nfish, for example). But even our\npresent-day ecosystems contain\nnothing unusual when compared to\nsome ancient assemblages of wacky\ncreatures.\nUnfortunately for paleontologists\n(fossil hunters to you and me) few\nancient creatures had the decency to\ndie under the sort of conditions that\nturned the interesting bits of their\nbodies into stone. So the fossil record\nis do minted by the hard bits of things\nthat take a long time to rot: shells,\nskeletons, teeth, finger nail clippings\nand so on. Usually the poor\npaleontologist has to reconstruct the\nrest of the creature using his\nimagination, though sometimes\nsimilar living creatures may be\naround to give him a clue. If the entire\ngroup of creatures has been extinct for\n300 million years then any such\nreconstruction is likely to be\nunreliable to say the least.\nOccasionally (we're talking very\nvery infrequently here\u2014say once\nevery 100 million years) something\nhappens that preserves a detailed\nrecord of a whole bunch of associated\ncreatures soft parts and all. One of the\nmost outstanding examples of this\noccurred about 520m years ago last\nNovember. A large undersea\nlandslide consisting of very fine-grained mud, buried a whole\necosystem almost instantaneously.\nThe fossilised remains of this\nlandslide is now called the Burgess\nShale and is located in British\nColumbia.\nThe fine grained nature of the mud\npreserved soft body parts in minute\ndetail. Some of the creatures can even\nbe cut open to reveal what they had\nfor lunch. X ray pictures of the shale\ncan also reveal subtle internal\nstructures.\nWhen the shale was first discovered\npaleontologists tried to fit the\ncreatures they could see into the\nknown categories of Cambrian (this\nis the geological epoch that lasted\nfrom about 600m to 500m years ago)\nfossils. However, recent detailed\nwork has shown that the shale\ncontains some very weird creatures\nthat have never been seen anywhere\nelse. In fact the creatures in the shale\nfit into about 18 broad categories\n(ph yi a to experts). 10 of these ph yi a are found nowhere else (all living\ncreatures fit into about 35 ph yi a). Some of the creatures are very very\nunusual and make the imaginations of\nscience fiction writers seem feeble by\ncomparison. One beastie, called for\nobvious reasons Hallucigenia, walked\non seven pairs of rigid stilts, had\nseven feeding tentacles on its back\neach with a forked tip, had a heavy\neyeless head and a gut that opened\nupwards. One assemblage of fossils\nshows a group of them scavenging a dead body. Another monster is called\nAnomalocaris. It was over one metre\nlong (though they were probably still\non Imperial units in those days) and\nshaped like a ray. It had long rippling\nflaps underneath a harder shell.\nApparently it drifted along the sea\nfloor grabbing unsuspecting bottom\ndwellers in its two jointed appendages\nand popping them into its circular\nmouth set on the bottom of its head.\nSeveral lucky trilobites have been\nfound that survived an encounter with\nAnomalocaris with nothing more than\na scar.\nThe Burgess shale appears to be\nunusual only in the quality of the\nfossils: many of the traditional hard-shell Cambrian creatures are also\nfound there. It's just that everywhere\nelse the soft bits rotted before the\ncreatures were fossilised. So life in\nthe Cambrian was a great deal more\nvaried than we could have imagined.\nThere also seems to be no particular\nreason why some of the creatures\nsurvived while others died out. Indeed\nit looks as if the process of evolution\nthrows up a lot of pretty bizarre\nexperiments most of which will,\npurely by chance, fail. If things had\nonly been slightly different then, then\nthe world would be completely\ndifferent now. So if we ever do\ndiscover life on another planet, it may\nwell have fourteen legs, seven\ntentacles and no eyes: it certainly\nwon't be what we expect.\n6 Friday 6th May 1988 FELIX\n\n"

In this column I hope to preview concerts at the major\ninstitutions of music in London\u2014The\nSouth Bank Centre and the Barbican.\nI hope to point out a 'gig of the\nweek'(!), generally provide for\nclassical music fans and, I hope,\nencourage others to give classical\nmusic a chance.\nThere is no preview in the column\nthis week, but I hope to include\npreviews in future columns.\nREVIEW\nThe Wasps Overture\n\u2014Vaughan Williams\nConcerto for 'Cello & Orchestra\n\u2014Dvorak\nSymphony No 4\u2014Tchaikovsky\nRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra at the\nCambridge Corn Exchange,\nConductor Charles Groves, Cello\nPaul Tortellier.\nThe names of Paul Tortellier and the\nRPO combined to ensure the concert\nwas a sell out\u2014and the tickets were\nexpensive. Although he is now 74\nyears old, the French master is surely\nthe top cellist in the world, following\nthe death of Pierre Fourniet a couple\nof years ago.\nBefore we heard The Man, we first\nwere presented with a short piece\nwritten by one of England's greatest\ncomposers, Ralph Vaughan-Williams\n(who once studied further down\nPrince Consort Road at the RCM).\nThe Wasps was written as incidental\nmusic to a Cambridge University\nproduction of Areslophanes' play of\nthe same name. Although I'm not a great fan of English pastorale music,\nI was pleasantly surprised and the\nimitation of a wasp by the strings\nwas interesting.\nDvorak's cello concerto in B minor\nis arguably the greatest work for solo\ncello every written. Unusually, the\nfirst movement's two main themes are\nintroduced before the solo in stu ment is heard. The second of these, the\n'prairie theme' was played with great\nsensitivity by the French horn player\nwhose slight error in a top note would\nnot have been noticed by those who\nhad not heard the piece before.\nThen Tortellier entered with a repeat of the first theme, his\narrogance in performance well suited\nthe music. Tortellier's dazzling\nfinger work makes watching him play,\na real experience. And during long,\norchestral sections the way in which\nhe pushes away his cello, legs crossed\nand both hand resting on the floor\nmakes one wonder whether he will\nmake the next entrance on time!\nTortellier's playing wasn't all good.\nI felt his tuning was very heavy in\nplaces and he seemed to slide\nhaphazardly into some of the notes.\nHowever, there was a lovely moment\nwhen the cello plays against solo\nviolin and flute. Barry Griffiths\n(leader), Tortellier and the flautist\nplayed as if they were the only ones\nthere.\nAfter the concerto both Graves and\nTortellier took four curtain calls,\nreinforcing the suspicion that these\nconcerts are merely ego trips for the\nbig names concerned.\nAfter the interval, Tchaikovski's fourth, with its characteristic chords\nand fast, repeated passages for the\nwhole orchestra brought a fitting end\nto a very enjoyable concert.\n12 Friday 6th May 1988 FELIX\n\n"

It looked bad:\nUAU 0 were allegedly stronger than\neither Scotland or London, as they\nsuggested by beating Wales and the\nScots, and London were in danger of\nhaving another lacklustre tournament.\nFortunately, London met Wales next,\nand trounced them 15-2, 15-5 to boost\nconfidence for the battle to come.\nUAU II were obviously not expecting\nmuch, On court, they behaved as if\nthey had a right to a place in the final,\nwhich cost them dear. Five minutes\ninto the first set, London were 10-1\nup, and finished at 15-3. UAU were\namazed, and had to show all their\nstrength to block out the firepower of\nWalter Sextro and captain Steve\nPickett and take the second set 15-11.\nIn the third, several players picked a good time to play their best\nvolleyball. On back court, Vincent\nLebeault scurried about and retrieved\nimpossible spikes, whilst the setters,\nLuca Grassano and Julian Puczyniec\nblocked (and set) superbly. After two\nmatch points, London finally took the\ngame 15-13, and a place in the semi-final. Unfortunately, here Northern\nIreland were too strong, and won 2-0\nwhich was somewhat anti climatic. The sweetener was the chance for\nrevenge over Scotland, beaten by\nUAU I in the other semi-final, which\nLondon gladly took (2-0) for a well-deserved bronze medal.\nFinal placings:\nGold: UAU I Silver: Northern Ireland\nBronze: London\n4th: Scotland\n5th: UAU II\n6th: Cambridge\n7th: Oxford\n8th: Wales\nACING\nPaul Shanley\nAs predicted last week, Doyoun was\nthe'winner of Saturday's2000 Guineas at Newmarket.

I will restrict my\ncomments to Paris because my\npersonal experience of eating in\nFrance does not extend into the\nProvinces. There will be the\nopportunity in future editions of\nFELIX to extend what I have to say\nhere. Any useful info can be passed\nto me on int 4320 or 4412.\nOn a student budget I would give\npriority to exploring the world of\nfromageries and char cute ries. Fromageries\nIt is important to remember that some\nof the dedicated fromageries buy their\ncheese from the farmers and age it in\ntheir own cellars on straw. I would\nrecommend that you search out the\nones that specialise in raw milk\n(un pasteurised) cheese (from age au\nlait cr u). The cheeses that I tried\ncovered much of the spectrum:\nCamembert\u20147he favourite cheese in\nFrance. You will find a raw milk\ncheese Camembert very creamy.\nBrie\u2014Even though it might be a familiar cheese, it must be tried in\nFrance.\nMunster.\nLivarot.\nBouton-de-Chevre\u2014Small diskettes of\ngoat cheese.\nVieux Lille\u2014A strong pungent cheese.\nThis was my favourite. I liked it so\nmuch that I brought back a couple of\npounds of the stuff. I would often end\nthe day by having some on bread,\naccompanied by a cognac.\nThe adventurous amongst you\nmight want to go through a' de gustation'. This is a sampling of\nthe cheeses from every branch of the\nFrench cheese spectrum. It can be a single sampling accompanied by an\nexplanation of the background of\nevery cheese encountered or it can be\nan elaborate multi-course meal\nconsisting only of cheeses. One starts\nwith the light ones and finishes in a finale of blues.\nThe de gustation at Andrust\nFromagerie (41 Rue d 'Amsterdam,\nMetro-Liege) was brought to my\nattention. It might prove a little pricey\nas this establishment is one of Paris's top fromageries.\nCharcuteries\nYou should be able to find one quite\neasily. Here, you will find the\nopportunity to make a selection from\na range of hams, pates and sausages.\nMany char cute ries will provide tables\nwhere you can sit down to enjoy your\nselection with some bread and house\nwine.\nI found that I was quite lost when\nasking for things. Any knowledge of\nFrench food terminology will prove\na saviour. I am giving a very short\nlist of terms in the hope that the\nchar cute rie you visit will have the\nproducts that I mention.\nBoudin noir\u2014Pork blood sausages.\nJambon d 'Auvegre\u2014Raw, salt-cured\nsmoked ham.\nJambon de Bayonne\u2014Raw, salt-cured\nham.\nLard\u2014Bacon.\nSaucisson sec\u2014Air dried sausages.\nThe Chedeville at 12 rue du\nMarche-Saint-Honors (Paris 1, Metro\nTuillerie) has a reputation for stocking\na very wide selection of prepared\nmeat. You might like to go to this one\nif you are in the area.\nYou will have done yourself a great\nfavour if you manage to explore this\nsmall niche in the French gastronomic\ndomain, in between seeing the Louvre\nand the Musee d 'Orsay.\nBye for now,\nYishu.\nPS. Don't forget to bring me some\nVieux Lille.\nSpecial tip: You must must try\n'Pain Poilane au Levain naturel'. This\nis a very special sourdough bread,\nfirst made by the Paris baker Lionel\nPoilane. This should be able to be\npurchased at most boulanger ies.14 Friday 6th May 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "n Second International Week: Letter\na report from Grenoble from\nUnio\nHon Sex\nResidence Insurance\nI have begun to send notes directly to\npeople when a cheque arrives or the\nInsurers require further information.\nThis seems to work more quickly and\nmore efficiently than putting a note\nin FELIX. I am currently engaged in\nan analysis of claims from August\n1986 onwards, in the hope of\nthrowing up figures in relation to\nknown security problems and other\npossible problems yet to be identified.\nIf such areas can be acted upon,\nhopefully the effect will be to prevent\nsharp rises in the premium or the\nsuccess on each claim.\nClub Insurance\nThis is an area which I wish to\ntransfer onto the computer,\nparticularly inventories. This will\nenable easier updates of club\ninventories at the end of each year,\nbefore the renewal premium is\ndecided. All club captains and chairs\ncan look forward to a request nearer\nthe end of term for updates to their\ninventories.\nCancer video\nAs promised last term, there will be\na video on cervical cancer in the\nUnion Lower Lounge today. I have\nbooked the room from 12-2.00pm and\nwill be able to show the video more\nthan once as it is only around fifteen\nminutes long. I also have information\nsheets from WHIC (Womens Health\nInformation Centre). This event is\nopen to women only.\nNext year's Women's Officer will\nbe Gill Knowles (Mech Eng III).\nLinzi Wishart,\nWomen's Officer.\nAt the end of last term I represented\nImperial College and the United\nKingdom at the Second International\nWeek held at the Institut National\nPolytechnique de Grenoble (INP-G) in France from 20-27 March.\nI had a marvellous time in Grenoble\nmeeting students of technology from\n12 other European countries. During\nthe week the 30 or so of us spent\ntogether we were able to exchange\nviews and attitudes on the cultures and\neducational systems in our countries\nwhich in itself greatly furthered one\nof the intentions of the week\u2014to\npromote Europe amongst Europeans.\nAs well as touring laboratories in\nthe prestigious INP-G we visited\nsome local industries in the thriving\nscience park and a Renault factory\nnear Lyons. We participated in a debate with leading representatives of\nGrenobles industry about the\nEuropean scientist/engineer of the\nfuture. We spent a day skiing in\nPrapoutel\u2014well some of us trying\nwhilst for most of the others skiing\nwas very much a way of life. We\nsampled (numerous) wines in\nBeajoulais and were treated to a traditional regional meal of veal'sins test in es! But whether of the\ncocktail or dinner variety, parties\nwere in abundance throughout the\nweek. It culminated with INP-FIZZ,\na 'gala' comprising fashion show,\nmagic show, comedian, bands and\ndiscos attended by over 2000 people\nwhere we were addressed by the\ndirector of the INP-G and the mayor\nof Grenoble.\nSo having gathered that the week\nwas intended to be fun (and at the\nexpense of local Grenoble industry)\nthe reasons for being there were very\nimportant. The First International\nWeek was held in Stockholm in May\n1987 to bring together students of\nMathematics and Physics throughout\nEurope. In March 1988 Grenoble\nwent further than this and invited\nstudents from the most prestigious\nscience institutions in Europe and of\nany subject discipline to discuss how\nwe as students and eventually\nprofessionals can contribute to\nachieving the 1992 goal of a 'free'\nEurope. And so after two days of\nheated boardroom type discussions\nBEST, the Board of European\nStudents of Technology was born. (A multitude of acronyms were\nconsidered but each one discarded\nbecause it insinuated an unpleasantly\nin some or other language).\nBEST is currently known as the\nEAU, the European Association of\nUniversities, and is recognised by the\nFrench government as a non-political,\nnon-profit making entity. It is run by\nstudents (those who have participated\nin the International Week) for students\nof technological universities in\nEurope. The founder members of\nBEST have compiled a set of aims:\n1) To make available information\nabout participating universities to\ninterested parties.\n2) To mediate between participating\nuniversities and establish recognised\nexchange schemes.\n3) To mediate with industry to\nencourage the long and short term\nemployment of European students and\nengineers.\nAbove all, to support student\ninitiatives concerning European\noriented affairs where possible.\nBEST is still very much in the\nplanning stage and will be discussed\nfurther at the next International Week\nto be held in Eindhoven, Holland in\nNovember.\nOn leaving for Grenoble I did not\nreally consider what participating in\nInternational Week would entail apart\nfrom being just a free holiday. I am\nnow aware that I and the students of\nImperial College have an enormous\nresponsibility. If it has been decided\nin Europe that Imperial is an\ninstitution worthy of recognition, its\nstudents must be worthy of Europe.\nWe are all aware that this is an\ninstitution where apathy prevails and\nthe fact that the response for people\nto participate in the International\nWeek was abysmal exemplified it.\nThe UK represents one of the largest\npopulations in Europe. It would be a pity if the UK as represented by IC\ncould not help to advance the cause\nof BEST and a 'free' Europe merely\nbecause of the apathy of the students.\nA booklet on IW '88, the events of\nthe week, the creation of BEST and\nthe educational systems of the\ncountries represented will be available\nin limited numbers in the summer.\nAnyone genuinely interested in\nfurthering the cause of BEST and\nattending the next IW should contact\nme via the pigeonholes.\nEna Jawa (Chem Eng 3).\nSt Mary's Election fever comes to town! After\nthe non-event of the IC elections here,\ninterest is really keen with regards to\nour immediate representatives. This\ncan be explained with the fact that in\nthe past our SU has been our sole\nrepresentatives, this choice of\ncandidate is usually very considered.\nInitial returns indicate the\nlikelihood of a very high poll. In the\nregion of 400 hundred people will\nvote on each alternative. With total\nstudent numbers of approximately\n600, this turn out is respectable. The\nelectorate have five chances to vote\nat varying times this week (3rd to 5th May).\nThere has been much debate in the\ncorridors and recreation areas as to\nthe correct candidate. Obviously each\ncamp has their own band of loyal\nfollowers who will stick to the end,\ncome what may. The encouraging\nsign is the debate rife among the\n'thinking population'.\nIn all contested posts the standards\nare high, so any result will not\nadversely affect life here at St Mary's or our relationship with IC. The two\nbig jobs, President and Secretary\n(Vice President) are contested in a two way battle for each. This\nincreases the chance of a considered\nvote, though there is little to choose\nso absent ions may be high.\nThe system is initially first past the\npost though in a three-way fight, if\nthe result of the third placed candidate\nwould have affected the final result,\na re-run will be ordered with the last\nplaced candidate ineligible to stand.\nThis is a similar system to the 'level\nof preference' used in many other\nstudent elections.\nFor the candidates themselves, the\ntime has been rather stressful. The\nprogramme included a hustings with\nfree beer and wine available to those\nwho turned up! Thus the meeting\ndeteriorated as more alcohol was\nconsumed. Heckling grew in decibels\nas the meeting proceeded, the chief\nculprit being the individual serving\nthe free beer, who had liberally\nhelped himself. Natural justice was\ndone as later he was observed being\nviolently ill in the toilets. Poor guy!\nAccommodation for October\nNothing to pay throughout the\nsummer. Deposit given now secures\naccommodation for Oct 88.\nFully-furnished flats in South Ken,\nFulham and Putney. Flats for 3,4,5,\n6 and 8 share rs. Prices from \u00a336 per\nperson.

One such place of similar\ntranquil splendour is Gairloch, about\n100 miles from Fort William on the\nNorth West coast of Scotland,\ndestination of this year's ICYHA\nEaster camping trip.\nFor those feeling energetically\ndisposed, the Torridon Mountains,\nthe oldest and arguably some of the\nmost impressive in the British Isles,\nwere close at hand. We satisfied\nourselves with ascents of Ben Eighe\n(972m) and Ben Alligin (922m) \u2014they\nmay not be quite the loftiest of\nmountains, but any lack of height is\nsimply compensated for in the drama\nof the surrounding scenery.\nUnfortunately, in both cases our\narrival at the summit coincided with\nthat of a blizzard, so any planned\nridge-walking was thwarted.\nFor those of a more sedentary\ndisposition, there were low-level\ncoastal walks by Loch Ewe and Loch\nTorridon, providing admirable\nopportunities to spend an indolent\nhour or two lazing on one of the many\ndeserted sandy beaches, admiring the\nview, contemplating problem sheets\nundone, or keeping watch for that\nelusive sea otter (which, as a matter\nof interest, we never saw).\nThe total cost of the trip was \u00a3 7 0\nper person (including all food) and\nrepresented excellent value for a week\nspent in one of the more isolated\ncorners of Britain\u2014a pleasant change\nfrom the clam our of London.\nBALLOON\nSummer take off\nWe are looking for anybody who will\nbe around London during the summer\n(including all you post grads) and\nwould be interested in finding out\nmore about balloons and helping to\ncrew on some of our ballooning\nweekends all around the country. We\nalso desperately need a few more IC\nvan drivers. You need to be over 21,\nhave a clean license for eighteen\nmonths and also need to take a( simple) IC van test which we can\nhelp to arrange.\nEver fancied flying? Now may be\nyour chance! If you would like to\nknow more about what we do as a club then read on. Better still, come\nto one of our regular Thursday\nlunchtime meetings at 1pm in\nSouthside Upper Lounge (just ask\naround for the balloonists!). We will\nalso be meeting (socially) Thursday\nevenings as well at 7pm( same place\nor in the Bar). You can also contact\nme via the RCC pigeonholes (in the\nUnion Office).\nAs a club, we had planned two trips\nover Easter. In the end we only went\non one trip (the second was cancelled\ndue to rain, wind and low cloud) to\nGreat Missenden, to what is called the\n'April fool's Balloon Meet'. The\nCANOE\nWhite Water Wetting\nAfter the initial problems of not\nhaving anyone to drive the minibus,\nand a disappointing lack of numbers,\nwe set off for North Wales at about\n9 o 'clock on Friday, the last day of\nterm, for what was to be four days\nof excellent canoeing.\nSaturday morning was wasted as\nfour of the group were prevented\nfrom paddling the Aberglaslyn Gorge\nnear Beddgelert by the local water\nbailiff, (access to good white water\nis quite a problem in England and\nWales).\nInstead we drove to Capel Curig\nand all six of us paddled the River\nLlugwy which was a bit more suitable\nfor the less competent (or is it more\nsensible), of us.\nOn Sunday the prospect of the Fairy\nGlen on the River Conwy reduced the\ngroup of madmen to three.\nFortunately three regular paddlers of\nthis grade V stretch, (grading s of\nrivers range from I \u2014flat water, to\nVI\u2014nigh-on impossible) were setting\noff at the same time and helped show\nour three down. The river was rough\nenough to send Nigel (our Chairman)\non the first swim of his paddling\ncareer.\nDue to a lack of water in the area\nwe moved down to Bala where the\nRiver Tryweryn international white\nwater centre is sited.\nMonday was spent here\u2014the dam\ncontrolled river providing non-stop\ngrade III and IV water where many\ntop canoeing competitions are held.\nOn Monday night we explored Bala\nTown itself (well cafe and pub\nbasically) and on Tuesday we paddled\nthe River Winion near Dolgellau.\nThis time we didn't get kicked off the\nriver until we had finished paddling.\nA quick lunch stop and then on to\nthe River Eden where the water (so\nI'm told) was disappointingly low,\nwhich saw an end to our canoeing\nactivities.\nIf the recent article in FELIX put\nyou off the Canoe Club, take heart,\nwe try hard not to kill off our\nmembers.\nIn the near future a more placid\nweekend to Symonds Yat on the River\nWye is planned. So, if you're\ninterested in that, have anything to\noffer us, or think we have anything\nto offer you, come along on Tuesday\nnights, 6.30 in the Beit Quadrangle\nfor a session in the swimming pool,\nor 8.30 in Southside Lounge for a drink and a chat.\nweather forecasts for the Easter\nweekend had not looked good\n(depression and an approaching cold\nfront) but undaunted we loaded up the\nballoon Thursday evening hoping for\nat least one flight in the morning. We\nalso had to buy an OS map which our\nretrieve crew were missing and which\nwas essential if they weren't to get\nlost when chasing the balloon around\nBuckinghamshire!\nFriday morning we got up at 5am and drove down to Missenden for the\npilot's briefing at 6.30am( we\nballoonists are suckers for\npunishment\u2014it was a beautiful\nsunrise, if that's any consolation?).\nThe morning flight was amazing,\nthe balloons bobbing in the gorgeous\nsunshine around us\u2014could the\nweatherman have been wrong\n(again)? Friday evening was a little\nbreezy for our liking. We decided to\nremain safely on the ground and\nwatched as many others burnt holes\nin their balloons attempting to take\noff.\nOn Saturday the weather was\nperfect again and we had two superb\nflights. Then on Sunday morning we\nhad our fourth fly able slot to finish\noff a great weekend.\nHappy landings,\nJan Vonka (Chairman).\nFELIX Friday 6th May 1988 13\n\n"

The\nreport was prepared by six members\nof the Committee who have specific\nknowledge of the Stores.\nAlthough the Committee agreed\nthat the present system was\nunsatisfactory and not fulfilling its\ncustomers' needs, it disputed the\nCollege's conclusion that the Stores\nshould be shut. The report identified\nseveral common shortfalls in the\nservice and proposed solutions to the\nproblems. These problems include the\nlarge number of items 'temporarily\nout of stock', low turnover of some\nlines of stock, inadequacy of Stores\ncatalogues and wasteful organisation\nof space and staff.\nThe report recommended the\nappointment of a College Purchasing\nOfficer, who would be able to remove\nobsolete stock and consult\nDepartments and administrative\nsections in order to investigate their\nneeds. Ordering and stock control\ncould be run on a new microcomputer\nsystem, eventually leading to\nelectronic mailing of customers\norders. It was also proposed that the\ncounter opening hours be extended\nand the Catalogue include more\ndetailed descriptions.\nThe Committee justified the\nexpense of these measures by pointing\nout that there had been very little\ninvestment in the Stores over several\nyears, although there had been losses\nof staff and space over the same\nperiod. The report concluded that\nthese initial expenses would be\noutweighed by. an increase in\nefficiency, which would provide the\nmost cost-effective service for the\nadministration and Departments of the\nCollege.\nAppointment\nDr Raanan Gillan, Director of the\nCollege Health Centre, has been\nap poir id a Visiting Professor of\n'ling's'ue en Elizabeth a id Chelsea\ni KQC >ile ge, London.

Also\nunwilling to share a platform with Mr\nCastalyn were the Zambian,\nZimbabwean and other African\nembassies contacted. The Labour\nParty couldn't provide a speaker due\nto a problem with communications at\ntheir headquarters and the District\nElections which occurred on the day\nof the debate.\nTherefore the Debating Society\nasked Sydney Harbour-Bridge to be\nthe main opposing speaker which he\nwas willing to do until he received a phone call from national AntiApartheid last Friday evening. A meeting of IC Union Executive on\nWednesday decided that it would\ndelay Union participation until the\nCouncil meeting on May 16\u2014after the\nday of the debate. An attempt was\nmade to continue with a general\ndiscussion on the freedom of speech\nwhich the Debating Society\ncommittee thought was at stake. A picket of College Anti-Apartheid\nmembers asked people not to go into\nMech Eng 220 where the debate was\nbeing held. The President of the\nDebating Society, Lynda Matthews\nspent forty minutes asking them to go\ninto the debate to explain their point\nof view, as they would not have to\nshare a platform with a representative\nfrom the South African Embassy.\nHowever, they said that they were\ntotally against participating.\nMark Gialanze, Vice Chairman of\nthe Debating Society said 'the role of\nthe Debating Society is at stake.\nShould we or should we not promote\ndiscussion.' The Society hopes to hold\na debate next term when they can find\nsomeone willing to oppose a speaker\nfrom the South African Embassy.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

    "content": "Examinations, Anxiety and Commonsense\nWritten, formal\nexaminations have\na hallowed place in\nacademic life, and\nwhile, from time to\ntime,\neducation a lists have\nespoused alternative\nmethods, they are\nwidely accepted as\nthe fairest and most\nefficient means of\nassessing students'\nknowledge and\nunderstanding.\nby Don Adlington:\nStudent\nCouncellor\nThe written examination is not,\nhowever, by any means a precise\ninstrument. It is certainly possible, for\nexample, on individual papers, to\ncome up with a 'fluke' result, that is\na result markedly better than the\nstudent's actual ability would have led\none to expect. It is also\nunquestionably possible to come up\nwith results that are worse than either\nthe student or his teachers anticipated,\nand which do not fairly reflect the\nstudent's ability.\nThe risk of systematically\nunder performing in a set of\nexaminations is linked to two\nseparate, but closely related, factors:\n(a) an inadequate technique for\nplaying the examination game, and (b) an inadequate recognition that a formal examination, like any other\ntesting situation, can generate levels\nof anxiety which in themselves may\nhave an adverse effect on intellectual\nfunctioning.\nPlaying the examination game\nExaminations are to some extent an\nabstraction from reality, an artificial\nconstruct. They are a sort of game in\nwhich the participants are invited to\ndemonstrate what they know, in\nwriting, on a blank piece of paper, in\na set time. An important component\nof the game is that the examiner is\nforbidden to give credit on any other\nevidence than that presented in the\nscript. It is an astonishing fact that\ndespite this elementary point, some\nstudents insist on, abandoning\ncommon sense to the extent,\napparently, of playing another game\naltogether. A common manifestation\nof this is the student who spends an\nhour and three quarters (out of three\nhours) writing, re-writing, polishing\nand perfecting one answer out of four\nor five required.\nAnother common departure from\nthe rules consists in writing out the\nanswer without properly reading the\nquestions. There are two, equally\ndevastating variants to this: (a) not\nselecting the questions which opt i mise the candidate's chances of scoring\nhigh over-all, and (b) misreading\nindividual questions and subsequently\nwriting an answer to a question which\nin effect is not there.\nSome basic and well recognised\ncomponents of a good examination\ntechnique are as follows:\n1. Read the question paper\n| carefully, preferably twice. Errors of\nperception are high correlated with\nheightened anxiety.\n2. Select the questions you are\ngoing to answer, put them in order,\nand write out a simple timetable,\nallowing the same time to all\nquestions (assuming the same\nmaximum marks for each). Allow\nfifteen minutes for the planning and\nfive minutes at the end for finishing\noff. Some people find it helps to make\nquick notes on each question at this\nstage.\n3. Be disciplined in adhering to the\ntimetable. Recognise that the first few\nmarks accruing to a question can be\nobtained far more easily than the last\nfew\u2014and it is the total mark which\ncounts. If you get stuck in the middle\nof a question leave it and deal with\nthe next one. You can always return\nto the unfinished answer later, and\nindeed the very act of disengaging\nfrom the difficulty may allow a resolution to surface which your mind\nis actually focussed on something\nelse.\n4. Answer the easiest question first,\nso that you can proceed to the others\non a psychological 'high'.\n5. Don't be afraid to make rough\nnotes in your answer book. When you\nare answering one question, ideas\nrelating to other questions you are\ngoing to answer may come into your\nhead\u2014jot them down. Similarly on\nentering the examination room, and\npossibly before reading the paper at\nall, you may wish to write down very\nquickly salient points which you have\nmemorised in your final preparation.\nIt is, of course, essential to rule out\nrough work very clearly, so that the\nexaminer knows that it does not form\npart of your answer.\n6. If you run out of time, tell the\nexaminer so, and say which points\nyou would have gone on to discuss if\nyou had more time.\nDealing with anxiety\nA degree of anxiety, accompanied by\nrecognised physiological symptoms,\nis a normal reaction to testing and\nstressful situations. Everyone is\naffected to some extent and should be\naware of it. You tell yourself that you\nare anxious, that it is natural, and that\nyou can handle it. In doing that, you\nminimise the risk that the anxiety may\nescalate to a point where it becomes\ndisabling. Again there seem to be\nsome common sense ways of handling\nthis problem.\nArrive early\u2014far better be biting\nyour nails outside the examination\nroom, than sitting in a traffic jam in\nEarl's Court. Once you are in the\nexamination room, sit down and relax\nfor a minute or two before doing\nanything.\nTo a certain extent anxiety is\ncontagious. If you feel that this is a hazard for you, then 'keep yourself\nto yourself before admission to the\nexamination room. It may also be\nworthwhile resisting the impulse to\ncompare notes with all your friends\nimmediately after an exam.\nIt is also a good idea in the\nexamination itself, not to let yourself\nbe thrown if your neighbours appear\nto be writing with more facility than\nyou are. They may, for all you know,\nbe writing rubbish, and in any case,\ninordinately long answers do not\nnecessarily bring the best results.\nThe most common symptoms of\nanxiety getting out of hand, is an\noverwhelming sense of panic, a temporary breakdown of our rational\nand ordered response to a demanding\nsituation. In an examination this may,\nfor example, take the form of\n'blanking out'\u2014completely forgetting\neverything. The remedy for this is to\nswitch off, close your eyes, and do\nnothing for a while.\nThis is far better than yielding too\neasily to the powerful impulse to\nresolve the tension by giving up\naltogether. When you feel that the\nanxiety attack has abated, try getting\nyour mind working again by using a 'scribble technique'. Just write\ndown\u2014any words\u2014which lead to\nother words, until you feel that your\nfaculty of recall is available to you\nagain.\nA final point. If you have a history\nof becoming particularly anxious at\nexam times, or if for contingent\nreasons you think that you may do so\nthis time, it would be sensible to talk\nto someone about it well be for hand. Tell your personal tutor or your\nsenior tutor, talk to a doctor or nurse\nat the Health Centre, or come to see\nme. Just a small amount of practical\nhelp may make a substantial\ndifference in the event.\nSome material in this article is derived\nfrom a lecture given by Dr Robert\nSharp of the Institute of Behavioural\nTherapy.\n8 Friday 6th May 1988 FELIX\n\n"
