    "content": "Superhuman\nMeredith Thomas ventures into the weird land\nof the cyborgs at the Wellcome Collection\nhat do dildos,\nwheelchairs and\nsteroids have in\ncommon? There\nare probably\nonly two places in London you will\n\ufb01nd these three things in conjunc-tion. One of them is not suitable for\na family newspaper, the second is the\nWellcome Collection. In the latter\ncase their justi\ufb01cation for sharing a\nroom is their function as devices with\nwhich humans have tried to improve,\nrepair or augment their bodies. This is\na theme that should excite scientists\nand artists and equal measure.\nCannily placed in the middle of an\nOlympic summer, Superhuman explores the theme of human enhance-ment. Despite the timing, the show\nexpands the premise to wider contexts\nthan simply sport. The curators have\npulled together an unapologetically\nidiosyncratic show with a rambling\nscope, sitting somewhere between\ngallery, museum and Coney Island\nfreak show. This will be familiar to anyone who has visited the venue before.\nHowever the 100 artefacts, including\nartworks, videos and archaeological\ncuriosities, de\ufb01nitely make for an impressive collection.\nTypically of the Collection, you are\nnot permitted to simply browse and\nenjoy. The curators seek to poke your\nconscience and provoke your imagination with every step. The \ufb01rst question\nthe curators ask is what we mean by\nenhancement. We probably all agree\nthat medical innovations designed to\nrepair or replace function lost through\nillness or injury count. This would include prosthetic legs and pacemakers\nbut are we willing to count sex toys,\nhigh heels and recreational drugs?\nHow con\ufb01dent do we feel about a future where transhumanist dreams of\nimplants and robotic limbs start to\nlook a lot less far-fetched?\nThe result is an inclusive and slightly\nsubversive exhibition. The very \ufb01rst\nthing you see as you enter the space is\na tiny 2000-year-old stature of Icarus.\nThis one tiny \ufb01gure is a concise allegory for the timelessness of mans\u2019 imperative to enhance and the inherent\npitfalls that result. What follows is a\njourney past Egyptian false toes, gothic devices for assisting thalidomide\nvictims and photographic histories of\ndrug scandals from the early days of\nthe Tour de France.\nWhat really hit home from the exhibition is that the instinct to add an\naugment is so very old. Previously aesthetic enhancement has been a dominant theme. Jewellery, make-up and\nclothing are very familiar examples of\nthis desire to arti\ufb01cially change one\u2019s\nimage.\nThe second thrust historically has\nbeen medicinal and restorative. However thought has been limited to simply replacing lost functionality. These\ne\ufb00orts have often been abysmal, clumsy failures.\nThere are more speculative and\nre\ufb02ective exhibits too. There are examples of comic book heroes with\nsuperhuman abilities and interviews\nwith futurists fretting about the social\nimpact of cybernetics.\nThe show has undoubtedly bene\ufb01ted\nfrom the interest in Paralympic sport\nover the summer. One the interesting\nthemes that emerges is the changing\nattitudes to disability prompted by\ntechnical advance.\nOne of the exhibits, a rare screening\nof Matthew Barney\u2019s \ufb01lm Cremaster\nreveals athlete and model Aimee Mullins (pictured top) in all her unconventional beauty.\nIn case you are unaware of Mullins,\nsu\ufb03ce to say she is gorgeous from the\nknees up. Her extraordinary athletic\nprowess and a widely viewed TED\ntalk, discussing her disability, have\nmade her an in\ufb02uential proponent of\nthis change in attitude.\nShe now has designers \ufb01ghting for\nthe chance to create prosthetic legs for\nher and \ufb01lm makers like Barney queuing up. His piece shows her wearing a\nrange of unconventional prosthetics\naimed at challenging ideas of body\nimage. These include animal inspired\nworks and jelly\ufb01sh tentacles.\nThings are certainly changing, with\ntechnology o\ufb00ering real potential to\nARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\n22\nThe Tanks @ Tate Modern \u2013 Don\u2019t miss out on making your way to the experimental performance space currently found in the stark and industrial galleries of the\nTate Modern.

Does it, however, follow that\nmerely because we have the technol-ogy, we should use it?\nAt the end of the show the we are\nled into the realm of the the hardcore\ntranshumanist. We are introduced to\nthe concept of enhancements directly\nintegrated with the body, not to replace missing function but to add new\nabilities.\nThere are strange videos of patients\novercome by cybernetic infections\nand the wheelchair of dead artist Donald Rodney roams freely around the\ngallery, tracking lonely trajectories.\nThese artworks speak of our fears and\ndiscomfort surrounding the idea of\nchanging and adding to our own bod-ies. We recognise tattoos and piercings as fairly normal, are bionic devices a natural extension of these ancient\npractices?\nDreams of a new bionic dawn remain largely in the realm of science\n\ufb01ction, due to cost, legality, ethical\nconcerns or the harsh reality of what is\npossible. Occasionally however, these\nrealms do drift closer to reality. Out\nthere on the fringes is where things\nget a little weird. Black-and-white morality starts to give way to some rather\nuncomfortable shades of grey.\nYou have one week left to catch Superhuman at the Wellcome Collection.

In the Saudi\nversion of the catalogue, women\nhave been airbrushed out of pictures,\nincluding a woman standing in\nher pyjamas and an Ikea designer.\nMembers of the Swedish government\nin particular were very critical of the\nmultinational group, stating that\ncompanies should not abandon their\nvalues abroad. Saudi Arabia has been\nin the spotlight for women\u2019s rights\n(or lack thereof), as women do not\nyet have the right to vote, and it is\nthe only country in the world where\nwomen are not allowed to drive.\nSynchronised Toilet Flush\nCitizens of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe,\nhave been asked to participate in a\nsynchronised toilet flush. The aim is\nto prevent blockage of sewage pipes\nby keeping them wet. This has been\ndifficult due to a prolonged drought\nand water shortages. Authorities\nhave warned that residents who fail\nto flush their toilet at the designated\ntime and date will risk being fined.\nThe first flush took place at 17:30\nGMT, 24th September 2012. Two\nsynchronised toilet flushes have been\nscheduled every week from now on.\nTrain Wreck\nThe Department for Transport has\ngone back on its decision of giving\nFirstGroup the west coast mainline\ncontract. When the contract was\nawarded during the summer, it was\nmetwithcriesofprotestfromRichard\nBranson and Virgin, the west coast\u2019s\ncurrent operator. Branson claimed\nFirstGroup\u2019s bid was unreasonably\nhigh and service quality would\ndeteriorateorleadtoasimilarcrisisas\nthat of the east coast mainline, which\nwas subsequently nationalised. The\ndecision was finally scrapped last\nweek by the government, explained\nby flaws in the bidding process and\ncalculation mistakes. The blame\nhas been placed on civil servants,\nincluding three who have been\nsuspended. The government is now\nfaced with two difficult challenges.\nThe bidding process has been shown\nto be complicated and flawed, it will\nmost likely need to be abandoned or\nreformed. In addition, Virgin Trains\u2019\ncontract ends on 9th December; the\nroute will have to be nationalised or\nan agreement will have to be reached\nwith Virgin until a new bidding\nprocess can go through. The blunder\nhas cost taxpayers \u00a340million and is\nestimated to cost another \u00a375million\nfor every year the new contract is\ndelayed. FirstGroup has stated it is\nconsidering legal action.\nMarie-Laure Hicks\nMiliband\u2019s Makeover\nAfter his party address and mastering of the skill of repetition (\u201cOne Nation\u201d - 46 times), the\nLabour leader is hoping to boost his election chances. Matthew Proctor looks into them.\nd Miliband is on a high: his\nparty has a 14 point lead over\nCameron\u2019s Conservative\nparty (YouGov/The Sun)\nwho are themselves su\ufb00ering from\nsomewhat of a crisis of identity as\nCameron struggles to \ufb01nd policies\nthat will impress his right-wing\nbackbenchers but will still keep\nhis Lib Dem colleagues satis\ufb01ed in\ngovernment.\nThe Conservatives are struggling\nthen, but, is it possible for Miliband to\nwin the next election? His election to\nleader of the party brought widespread\ncriticism from some in the party who\nbelieved that his brother, David, was\nthe more con\ufb01dent character and was\ntherefore more suited to the job. To\nsome, David represented a new-era\nTony Blair who would take the Labour\nParty back to 1997 levels of support.\nHowever, the votes of the unions for\nEd Miliband eventually meant that he\nwas voted in.\nMiliband is still thought of as a bit\nof an awkward character who can\u2019t\nreally be seen to be a true leader.\nIt was therefore important that he\nmade a strong impression at his party\nconference last week. He had to make\nsure of three things:\nA New Image\nEd took to the stage without notes,\nechoing what Cameron has done time\nand time again, and began to speak\ncon\ufb01dently, casually joking along.\nHe had strong presence on the stage,\nmoving around and making himself\nseen. Comparing this speech to his\n2010 inaugural speech as Leader\nof the Opposition, the changes are\nprofound: from a bumbling man\nbehind a podium to an assured man\ncommanding his audience. This was a\nnew Ed Miliband, a true leader. That\u2019s\nthe \ufb01rst point ticked o\ufb00.\nA party with real policies?\nUnfortunately, his speech was rather\nlacking in this department. Miliband\nmainly talked about his own life and\nhis upbringing \u2014 making sure to\nexplicitly mention, multiple times,\nthat he went to a comprehensive\nschool and that he was born in a\nNational Health Service hospital.\nThis kind of spiel of course excited\nthe strong left-wing crowd, but it did\nlittle to allay voters\u2019 fears that the\nLabour party were simply a party to\ncriticise the Coalition\u2019s policies while\ncontinuing without a clear policy\nplan themselves. Miliband also piped\non once again about \u201cdealing with\nthe banks\u201d but failed to say how he\nplanned on doing so.\nA party of the people?\nMiliband talked of a \u201cOne Nation\u201d\nLabour. This harks back to Disraeli,\na Conservative politician and Prime\nMinister from 1874 to 1880. It was\na bold move from Miliband. \u201cHe\n(Disraeli) was a Tory\u2026 but don\u2019t\nlet that put you o\ufb00!\u201d he joked. He\npraised Disraeli\u2019s vision of a country\ncoming together to defeat fascism\n\u2014 Miliband presented his vision of\na Britain coming together today to\nrebuild the country after high levels\nof unemployment, a widening gap\nbetween rich and poor, and a general\nview that meritocracy has gone out of\nthe window. It was a clever hijacking of\na traditional Tory ideal and an attempt\nfrom Miliband to claw back the voters\nhe\u2019d lost at the 2010 election \u2014 the\nmiddle-class, centre-ground men and\nwomen who had lost faith in Labour\nduring the economic collapse in 2008.\nMiliband wanted to \ufb01nish the idea of\nNew Labour without going back to\n\u201cold Labour.\u201d\nSo that\u2019s two out of three overall. Not\na bad show from the Labour leader. In\nfact, YouGov polls showed that after\nthe conference, con\ufb01dence in whether\nEd could become PM rose by 6 points.\nHowever, there\u2019s still a widespread\nview that, currently, Cameron is\nbetter o\ufb00 as PM. We\u2019ll have to wait\nand see how the Conservative party\nconference turns out before we can\nclearly say how well Ed Miliband has\ndone. However, with Cameron \ufb01nding\nit hard to keep his backbenchers\nhappy and Osborne losing grip on\nthe economy, it\u2019s hard to see how\nCameron can turn the polls around to\na clear Tory victory in 2015.\nIf they aren\u2019t victorious, it seems\nincreasingly likely that Cameron will\nbe ousted. Will this mean a return\nto the House of Commons for Boris\nJohnson? Probably not, with more\nright-wing characters such as Michael\nGove and Liam Fox impressing\nbackbenchers and Boris in the\nmayoral o\ufb03ce until 2016. Boris fans\nwill likely be disappointed come the\nnext Parliament.\nAbortion debate resurfaces\nOne of the central features of David\nCameron\u2019s reinvention of the Conservative party going in to the 2010 election\nwas the pull to the centre; dressed in\nthe vocabulary of the Big Society and\nGreen Conservatism, they sought to\nshed the old-fashioned, right-wing im-age. \u2018Backbench\u2019 MPs may have been\nunhappy, but the promise of government and a Tory majority kept them at\nbay.\nHowever, that majority resolutely\nfailed to materialise, and so began\nthe struggle between Cameron and\nhis backbenchers that seems to have\nde\ufb01ned the Conservative\u2019s period in\ncoalition. Indeed, one of the \ufb01rst things\nCameron did after becoming Prime\nMinister was to hammer through a\nvote allowing cabinet MPs to sit on\nmeetings of the 1922 Committee, a\ngroup of backbenchers that has the\npower to unseat a Tory leader.\nIn this way we can interpret the\nTories\u2019continualjerkstotherightasthe\ninevitable result of continual in\ufb01ghting,\nwithCameronswervingbetweendirect\ncon\ufb02ict with his backbenchers, such\nas the unprecedented rebellion over\nLord\u2019s reform, and attempts to placate\nthem such as continual discussion\nabout an EU referendum and the\nrecent Cabinet reshu\ufb04e.\nThe recent furore over\nJeremy Hunt\u2019s declaration\nof support for a reduction in\nthe 24-week abortion time\nlimit is a good example of\nthe continual push and pull\nbetween the centre and the\nright. Hunt\u2019s position,\nunchanged since\nthe 2008 vote,\nwhich kept the time-limit at 24 weeks,\nappeals strongly to the more hardline\nvoices in the back benches.\nAs Health Secretary, Hunt\u2019s role\nrequires evidence based decisions\nand, simply put, the evidence is\nentirely against him; survival rates\nbelow 24 weeks have not improved\nsubstantially, and both the British\nMedical Association and the\nRoyal College of Obstetricians and\nGynaecologists advise holding the limit\nat 24. Yet, by virtue of his position,\nhis rea\ufb03rmation takes on more\nweight than the similar remarks\nmade by Theresa May and\nEqualities Minister Maria Miller\nlast week.\nBut David Cameron has stated\nquite plainly that the Tories\nhave no plans to\ntable another\nvote on the issue\nof abortion. So why all the noise?\nLooking at the events with the context\nof in\ufb01ghting, it seems that Number 10\nsought to reassure hardline Tories with\na reminder that the Cabinet still sits\nto the right, in order to dampen the\npotential rebellion over the upcoming\ndebate on gay marriage.\nLooking at the speeches from the\nConservative Party Conference this\nweek, the language of the \u2018centre\u2019\nseems to have disappeared entirely.\nDespite Cameron\u2019s appeal that \u201cThe\nConservative party is for everyone\u201d\nand refusal to stop talking about the\ninvisible Big Society, his aides insist\nthat the common ground in politics\nsits with them, well right of centre.\nNumber 10, it seems, sides with the\nbackbenchers, but it\u2019s taken two and\na half years of pulling on their part\nfor Cameron to let slip the mask of\ncentrism.\n\u201cWhy, Ed, why?\u201d\nNick made a \u201cOne Nation\u201d\nspeech back in March.\nNot that anyone noticed.\nPolitics Editor Tal Cohen/AFP/Getty Images\n\n"

I hope it\u2019s interesting and that you enjoy the pretty in-fographics. We\u2019ve tried to strip out the\nboring waffling from us and just give\nyou the facts and figures.\nLeague tables are a tough one re-ally. It\u2019s impossible to really measure\nhow good a university is. It\u2019s definitely\nnot an exact science at all. The main\nproblem is that a lot of it can be subjec-tive, and some parts can be swayed by\npeople massaging the truth like their\nworking on a pleasure cruise. By this I\nmean both the academic assessment\nand the NSS. The NSS is, of course,\nthe most subjective, and the most\nopen to people attempting to cheat\ntheir university into a higher slot. I don\u2019t\nblame people for that. Wanting to have\na high value degree and excellent job\nprospects because of it isn\u2019t exactly a\ncrime.\nIt really does boil down to what you\nsay it actually is that makes an institution good. It could be the teaching standards, the satisfaction of the\nstudents, the quality of the research.\nThere are many different factors that\nall contribute towards making a university a good university. In my humble\nopinion, sometimes a name of an institution proceeds it, and they can always\ncount on being thought of as excellent.\nI\u2019m not convinced that, at this point in\ntime, the wider public are as intently\naware of who Imperial are.\nWhen discussing league tables it really is impossible to not talk about The\nGuardian really. They have become\nnotorious (sort of, well, amongst me\nat least) for the use of their strange,\nstupid, and downright absurd \u201cValue\nAdded Bullshit\u201d (actually called \u201cValue\nAdded Score\u201d, but that gets the gist of\nit across). What happens with this is\nthat it takes your entry tariff (your IB,\nA levels, whatever you needed to get\nin) and then looks at the degree you\nachieve from your university. It then\nsays that if you get very low grades\nat A Level and come out with a high\ngrade at university, then the university\nis excellent at teaching. This is, to put it\nmildly, a bit of an odd perspective. The\nquestion that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re shouting\ninto your sandwich is \u201ccouldn\u2019t that\njust mean that the course is really piss\neasy?\u201d. The answer, that I\u2019m hastily\nwriting on a Thursday night with too\nmuch caffeine and too little sleep, is\nyes. I really think that it does mean that\nthe degree is not as challenging. If you\ncome in with high grades and don\u2019t get\na first, to me, that indicated that the\ncourse is pretty tough going.\nImperial is very high in most of the\ntables. This indicates that we are, in-deed, a truly great university (with a\ntruly great newspaper...). In my mind,\nconsidering we are consistently within,\nat least, the top 30 in the world, I find it\nodd to think that I could have been accidentally allowed to waltz in through\nthe doors. It\u2019s a surreal feeling looking\nat those tables and figures and thinking \u201chey, I am at one of the best universities in the world\u201d. Well, according\nto what we found, you are. Now pat\nyourself on the back. Now stop patting yourself on the back as people are\nwatching you and you look slightly odd.\nHowever, my only perception of a\ndegree is actually this one that I have\ndone. How can I know what a degree\nis like elsewhere? How can I say that\nchemistry (which is what I \u201cstudied\u201d)\nis not better at, say, Bristol, or even (I\nshudder at the thought) UCL? The\nreason I close with this statement is to\ngive you a word of caution to pass on to\neveryone that will listen. Don\u2019t blindly\ntake ranking tables to be absolute fact\nand undeniable truth.

However the show\nwas anything but demure: shorts were\nsuper-short, colours were brassy me-tallics and rich brights.\nMilan is home to the iconic Italian\nbrands: Gucci, Fendi, Prada, Versace,\nand Dolce and Gabbana. Each collection walked to the beat of a completely\nunique drum: at Prada we were in Japan, at Dolce in Sicily, and at Versace\nit was a vampy Italian incarnation of\nCoachella. Then, Fendi showed graph-ic, fur-trimmed 60s silhouettes, and at\nGucci there were bright colour-block-ing and 70s shapes.\nHowever, the high point of fashion\nmonth was certainly Paris. Gareth\nPugh was startlingly beautiful and romantic yet severe, with blood-stained\neye-makeup \u2013 to me it screamed Lilith-chic. Vampires and fang-bangers\neverywhere: Pugh is where it\u2019s at.\nBalenciaga was thrilling and sexy,\nwith \ufb02ashes of skin in plentiful supply:\nGhesqui\u00e8re showed plunging sweetheart necklines, bare midri\ufb00s under\nsuits, and skirts cut shockingly high\non the thigh. There were handbags at\ndawn at the Saint Laurent show. When\nHedi Slimane didn\u2019t o\ufb00er New York\nTimes Fashion Editor Cathy Horyn a\nseat at his \ufb01rst collection at the house,\nshe proceeded to review his show as\nlacklustre (it was). Haider Ackermann\ncontinues to be a Paris highlight.\nSo, what\u2019s the parting message?\nWhat should you be stocking up on\nfor next season, and what trends are\ngoing to look so old that you won\u2019t\neven be able to deal with it? The simple conclusion to fashion week is that\neach editor, stylist, buyer and consumer draws their own conclusion. There\nare some trends that surface as THE\ntrends for the season, but some fade\ninto the ether. Block colours, monochrome and beautifully cut trousers\nwill be a highlight, but the fact is that\nwhat trickles down into the hands of\nthe ordinary consumer is dictated\nlargely by the major editors and buy-ers. And also what the people at Zara\nand Topshop think that you might\nlike.\nFASHION\nA bluffer\u2019s guide to\nfashion month\nIf one more person asks me what \u2018actually happens\u2019\nduring fashion week I will stub you with my Manolo\n17\nFashion Editors: Alex Ramadan,\nSaskia Verhagen, Alice Yang\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\nSaskia Verhagen Fashion Editor\nFor those unfamiliar, fashion month\nis a bi-annual occasion made up of\nfashion weeks in the four fashion\ncapitals, where the fashion community (editors, buyers, bloggers and\ncelebrities alike) collects to view the\nmajor designers\u2019 collections for the\nfollowing season. This September saw\nthe presentations for spring/summer\n2013, beginning in New York.\nThe major trend-setting collections to watch in New York are Marc\nJacobs and Alexander Wang \u2013 the new\nschool. Wang went with a predictably\nmonochrome palette, as well as his\nsignature streamlined sporty silhouette \u2013 nothing new to report there,\nbar some cutout detailing and (the\nhighlight of NYFW) his devastat-ingly chic 3-year-old niece, Aila,\nin the front row, complete with\nblack alligator print halter dress,\nmini Chanel 2.55, Ray Ban Wayfarers and tiny Nikes.\nJacobs\u2019 show served as\na prelude to his o\ufb00ering at\nLouis Vuitton. Starting at home\nat his own label, he showed thick\nstripes in a Factory Girl-inspired\nshow, with \ufb02ared shapes and\nsimple styling \u2013 hair backcombed\nat the crown and tied into a low\nponytail, with thick black eye-liner. Later, at his show for Louis\nVuitton in Paris, he showed an\namped-up version: more sixties shapes but this time, bold\nchecks both in chic monochrome and in 60s brights:\navocado green and lemon\nyellow. The Damier print\nhandbags also found themselves reincarnated in the\nnew colours.\nLifetime members of New York,\nand stars of red carpet glamour, Oscar de la Renta and Ralph Lauren\ndid not disappoint. The \ufb01rst half of\nLauren\u2019s show might have appeared\nlike a Spanish costume drama, complete with fringed piano shawls,\nmatador jackets and \ufb02amenco ruf\ufb02es. However the Latin theme came\ninto its own for eveningwear: Karlie\n\u201cOh girl that\nPrada fox stole is\nfrom like, before I\nwas born. Not chic.\u201d\nKloss waved her fan-shaped clutch\nbag wearing a crisp white shirt and\n\ufb02oor-length black sequinned crochet\nskirt, topped with a black felt boater,\nfollowed by \ufb02uttering white organza\nru\ufb04es, and a red \ufb01shtail dress with a\n\ufb02ouncing black bolero jacket.\nOscar\u2019s show had more variety \u2013\nfrom perfectly cut black gowns and\na Cruella DeVil monochrome sheath\ndress to the full-blown embellished\nglory of a turquoise blue feathered\nballgown and a strapless fuschia number embroidered with green pompoms \u2013 a sure bet for the red carpet.\nAnna Wintour graces very few\nshows at London Fashion Week \u2013\ndespite being London-born, she only\nbegan attending LFW a couple of seasons ago. Now\nthough, London is\nhome to some exciting designers \u2013 Erdem,\nChristopher Kane, and\nChristopher Bailey\nfor Burberry Prorsum. Other British\nlabels, including\nStella McCartney,\nAlexander McQueen and Gareth Pugh have\nsince decamped\nto Paris, considered a more prestigious place to show.\nKane and Erdem\nshared a common\npallete of sweet pas-tels, though Erdem\npunctuated his with\n\ufb02ashes of \ufb02uorescent\nbrights and Kane\nwith touches of\npunk \u2013 ga\ufb00er tape,\n\ufb01ligree rubber, and\nleather. The pieces\nwere trim and ladylike, yet\nmodern in fabric and cut.\nAt Burberry, Bailey seems\nto be moving the brand out of\nClockwise from top: Gareth Pugh, Balenciaga, Haider Ackermann\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\nMasterpiece of the Mundane\nMuch has been said derisively of the\nGerman sense of humour, but my\nfavourite book review of all time,\ntranslated for me by a friend, was of\nJonathan Franzen\u2019s 2010 work and appeared in a the German newspaper\nS\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. The closing passage of it read, simply: \u201cIt\u2019d probably\nbe unbearably boring if it wasn\u2019t such\na masterpiece\u201d.\nThis critical assessment is arguably\ntrue for all brilliant books (and \ufb01lms,\nand albums, and art) however with\nFreedom it feels particularly salient.\nThe story itself rotates around the life\nand dysfunctions of a normal-enough\nmiddle-class family: dysfunctions\nwhich have been well-worn by soap-operas and agony aunts but, when explored in Freedom, become painfully\nreal and thoroughly absorbing.\nThe sheer length and depth of the\nbook is physically daunting. At several\npoints throughout the story I could\nfeel the plot reaching a point that\nanother author could\u2019ve comfortably\nbegan wrapping up, however with an\noutput of just under one book a dec-ade, Franzen isn\u2019t in any hurry to \ufb01nish. By employing several interesting\nwriting techniques \u2014 for example by\nnot only shifting the imagined story\nteller, but also the imagined audience\nof the story being told \u2014 and by focusing on only 4 characters, Freedom\nmanages to\navoid reading\nlike it\u2019s well\nover half the\nlength of War\n& Peace, despite\nactually being so.\nUnfortunately,\nhowever, Franzen\nis a complete\nbell-end. If a book\nis about a white,\nmiddle-class liberal\nAmerican of mixed\nJewish/Scandinavian heritage from\nMinnesota and is\nwritten by a white,\nmiddle-class liberal\nAmerican of mixed\nJewish/Scandinavian\nheritage from Minnesota, and that guy is a\nbell-end, then his book\nis very likely to be full\nof complete bell-ends.\nUnfortunately Franzen\nis so good at writing that\na) you don\u2019t want to put\nthe book down because\nreading his writing is too\ndamn enjoyable and b) the\ncharacters are so robustly\nproduced and their character so expertly conveyed\nthrough fantastic story telling that every last little irritating despicable part of their\nThe much anticipated latest novel in\nIain M. Banks epic space opera series.\nAs with all of Banks\u2019 work you can\nexpect this to be an intelligent and\nhighly engaging read. All the Culture\nnovels are standalone so this is a great\noppertunity to get into the series.\nOrange prize winner Zadie Smith returns to writing with another highly\nacclaimed novel. NW tells the powerful story of four people from an\nimpoverished North West London\nhousing block development. A must\nread that deserves all of its accolades.\nDespite Hamilton being best known\nfor his trilogies and long series, his\nlatest o\ufb00ering is a standalone novel.\nThis is the perfect opportunity get\nacquainted with this brilliant author\nbefore he visits the College for the\nPicocon SF convention in February.\nScalzi\u2019s latest novel parodies the tenancy in Star Trek of redshirted security o\ufb03cers dying with alarming regularity while main characters remain\nunscathed. While not yet published\nin the UK you can get a US import\nfrom Forbidden Planet.\nWhile Rowling\u2019s \ufb01rst novel for adults\nhas received mixed reviews, it\u2019s still\nworth a look. While certainly not a\nhighbrow masterpiece much of the\n\ufb02air that made Harry Potter such a\nphenomenon is still on show.

The \ufb01nal result is that the reader\nis stuck reading a book full of people\nthey hate.\nAnd so the book proceeds for at\nleast 550 of it\u2019s 600 pages. Remarkably, considering its core of four\ncharacters and a plot focusing on\nthe collapse of the marriage between two of them, it feels like it\ncomprehensively and cynically\ndeals with every single talis-manic problem liberal America\nprides itself on having a voice\non: Family, Tradition, Mental\nHealth, Environmentalism,\nWomen\u2019s Rights, Commercialism and The Iraq War. The\ncentral theme that holds all\nthese together though is freedom \u2014 perhaps unsurprising\ngiven the name of the book\n\u2014 and the novel explorers\nits meanings and conse-quences, for good and ill.\nBy subtly combining\nenough food for thought\non broad moral dilemmas,\nexpertly satirising recent\nperiods of western history and society but all\nthe while keeping it to\nwithin the con\ufb01nes of\nan entirely relatable and\nmoving personal family\nstory, Franzen weaves\na masterpiece from the\ntruly mundane.\nMatt Allinson Writer\n\n"

Where\nwere they?\nAs one of the only foreign students to arrive in September to an\nagricultural university in the south\nof France, I thought it quite likely\nthat most of my acquaintances\nwould be from France. However, I could count the people of\nFrench origin who would stop\nand say hello on one hand. After 10 months there, I feel that\nis somewhat shocking.\nThat is not to say that I did\nnot make friends there; there\nwere some very lovely people from all over the world.\nEvery weekend I spent my\ntime with a group of foreigners speaking in pigeon\nFrench.

A true immersion in another culture is something different\nto travelling here and there.\nErasmus is a truly European ex-perience, where Bulgarians date\nBrits, Poles swoon with Swedes,\nand Germans canoodle with Spaniards. As well as much loving, there\nis, of course, much heartbreak and\nSTI-spreading. As summed up by\nUmberto Eco, Erasmus is a \u201csexual\nrevolution,\u201d where people are becoming European. His example involved a Catalan man and a Flemish\ngirl shacking up. Of course, he is\nromanticising, for there are risks\nof culture clashes and messy, long\ndistance mishaps. However, you\ncannot help but be impressed by\nthe German guy becoming fluent\nin Polish for his newfound love or\nat the French man proposing to his\nEnglish rose. For the record, both\nare true stories.\nDon\u2019t forget: we are truly lucky\nto live in the Europe we have to-day; we have had peace for seventy\nyears, and it has been more than\ntwo decades since the fall of the\nBerlin Wall. Don\u2019t forget we are free\nto study where we want, when we\nwant, intellect and money providing (Erasmus helps with the latter,\nbut not the former).\nDo not be limited by Erasmus. It\ndoesn\u2019t take that much effort to up\nsticks, go pick grapes in the Bordeaux region, au-pair in Prague,\nor intern in Vienna. Where there\nis a will, there is a way.

Although a\ngood premise and a best-selling novel,\nthe \ufb01lm itself is distinctly over-full\nand does appear to have been put\ntogether a little hastily \u2013 or not edited well enough to reduce the book\nto \ufb01lm length. That said, this modern\nclassic tale is generally well acted and\nwell scripted.\nBack in the Nineties, young teen\nCharlie (Logan Lerman \u2013 Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief) is a quiet,\nsensitive, emotional type, and is just\nstarting out at a new high school in\nPittsburgh, USA. Here, his stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller \u2013 We Need to\nTalk About Kevin) and stepsister Sam\n(Emma Watson \u2013 do you really need\ntelling?) take him under their wing\nand attempt to guide him through the\nearly twists of adolescence and the\n\ufb01rst few semesters of high school. As\nthe school year progresses, Charlie\n\ufb01nds himself the half-reluctant, half-delighted centre of attention within\nthe friendship group. However, the\nmystery surrounding both Sam (who\nis supposedly more hip and music-savvy than her mainstream peers, but\nfails to recognise Bowie\u2019s Heroes on\nthe radio) and Patrick (bitchy as hell,\nbut appears to be hiding something\nsigni\ufb01cant) leaves na\u00efve Charlie con-fused, upset and emotional. Is this really any better than his old, lonely life?\nStill trying to cast o\ufb00 Hermione\u2019s\nHogwarts robes, Watson does a good\njob in a role that is a little compli-cated. One false move and it could\nhave been horri\ufb01c, but thankfully\nWatson\u2019s convincing American accent and quirky acting style proved\nvery e\ufb00ective here. Lerman, too, is\nsolid in his role as the nervous, lonely\nCharlie \u2013 despite being relatively unknown alongside Watson. After his\nsigni\ufb01cant success in the role of Kevin\nin Lynne Ramsay\u2019s We Need to Talk\nAbout Kevin, expectations were rising surrounding Miller\u2019s performance\nin this, his latest venture. Sadly, although he does his best, one could\nsay he is ridiculously miscast as the\n\u2018gay best friend\u2019 \u2013 a weak role, poorly\nscripted and apparently mostly used\nto bulk the story out.\nThroughout the \ufb01lm there is an underlying thread of child abuse, suicide\nand su\ufb00ering (we see Charlie in a lab-coated therapists o\ufb03ce on a few occa-sions, seemingly to deal with past de-mons), supposedly to emphasise the\nkey points of the tale. Unfortunately,\nthe drama fails to support this theme,\nand the brief moments of excitement\nare more Eastenders than \ufb01ve-star\n\ufb01lm. The drama, too, seems like it is\nonly actually dramatic to the teenagers throwing the tantrums.\nAll things said, it is an enjoyable and\nsteady \ufb01lm, but the idea that \u2018less is\nmore\u2019 may have been a good notion to\nfollow here.\nLucy Wiles Film Editor\nEthan Hawte Hawke gets sweaty, wet, tense, and hard\nIt\u2019s a shame characters in horror \ufb01lms\nleave things until too late to put the\npieces together. They spend an agonising part of the running time going\nthrough all sorts of danger and jump\nscares but refuse to admit that there\u2019s\nsomething wrong with the house\nthey\u2019re living in. It\u2019s not entirely clear\njust what Ellison Oswalt (Hawke) is\ntrying to achieve when he moves into\nthe house where an entire family was\nhanged in their garden. Sure, he\u2019s a\ntrue-crime writer but did he really\nneed to drag his family into the scene\nof the crime? He of course keeps this\nlittle secret to himself, with his wife\nTracy (Juliet Rylance) and two children completely unaware of what\nthey are in for.\nFollowing the pattern most struggling writers do in \ufb01lms, he looks to\nScotch for his inspiration. Knocking\nback a bottle every evening without\nthe much feared consequences of a\nhangover, he sets up his own investigation \u201cwall\u201d where photographs,\nmaps, print-outs and articles are\nput up and tied together with bits of\nstring. It makes very little sense to us,\nbut Ellison seems to be pretty content\nand know what he\u2019s doing. But it\u2019s not\nuntil a miraculous discovery of home\nvideos that really kicks o\ufb00 his novel-writing process.\nSo what exactly have been recorded\nin these family home videos? Initially they appear harmless, of various\nhappy looking families. But in a series\nof bizarre twists, the videos go on to\nrecord some horri\ufb01c murders. Well\ncrafted and meticulously planned\nand executed, the families helplessly\nfall victim to some grizzly, nasty mas-sacres. But what do these seemingly\ndi\ufb00erent victims have in common?\nAs he embarks on his investigative\njournalism, often aided by a wannabe\nhelpful but slightly dim police o\ufb03cer\n(the excellent James Ransone who\nprovides priceless o\ufb00beat comedy),\nhe discovers links that aren\u2019t too fascinating or complex, and it frustrates\nus to see how long he spends to connect the dots. For a man who has supposedly written popular crime novels\nin the past, he\u2019s not too sharp when it\ncomes to actually doing his job.\nIn the meantime he hears odd nois-es, loud thuds, opened doors which\nwere surely locked, electronic equipment that was surely switched o\ufb00,\nand this carries on for several nights,\nas Ellison is incapable of taking a hint.\nPlus there\u2019s the obligatory young\ndaughter who sees things no one else\ndoes. Young girls in horror \ufb01lms traditionally turn out to be more crucial\nthan they seem. Cryptic dialogue,\nspoken in a soft, high-pitched voice\nof an assured child showing very little\nemotion, drawing random pictures\non the house wall; these are all textbook methods of throwing together a\nbunch of overused ideas.\nBut why does this \ufb01lm actually\nwork? Despite its unnecessarily\nlengthy running time, it\u2019s Hawke\u2019s\nJohn Park Film Editor\nDirector: Stephen Chbosky\nScreenwriter: Stephen Chbosky\nStarring: Logan Lerman, Emma\nWatson, Ezra Miller\nRon and Harry got hotter......\ngripping central performance that\nholds everything together from start\nto \ufb01nish. Forget the mystery, forget\nthe horror, and forget the clich\u00e9d\nscares. What Sinister has done so well\nbetter than any other horror \ufb01lm is\nthat it has truly found a capable lead,\na rarity in horror \ufb01lms that normally\nchoose to go for the young ones with\nlooks rather than talent. He inhabits\nhis role with commitment and compelling energy that helps to sell the\nstory, no matter just how ridiculous\neverything builds up to.\nThe familiar ideas do sometimes\nwork \u2013 but the overused cycle the\n\ufb01lm gets itself stuck in is a tiresome\none. It starts o\ufb00 with an intriguing\npremise: The Ring-like story a character stumbling across a horri\ufb01c\nfootage that marks you for all sorts of\nterror and violent demise. But from\nthat point on it never builds up to\nanything truly substantial. The ending is a shocking one, not the kind\ncommonly seen in \ufb01lms that decide\nto play it safe, but with Sinister, it\ndoes redeem some points with a daring \ufb01nale.\nDirector: Scott Derrickson\nScreenwriters: Scott Derrickson, C.\nRobert Cargill\nStarring: Ethan Hawke\nPut... the lanyard... down\n\n"

    "content": "What\u2019s for breakfast?\nYou don\u2019t need me to rehash that old\nclich\u00e9 about breakfast being the most\nimportant meal of the day, seeing as it\u2019s\nbeen nattered on enough. Some of you\nwho skip breakfast might even want\nto stab my eyeballs for even bringing\nit up. However, for the majority of you\nwho skimp on it because you rolled\nout of bed with precious little time to\nspare, this one\u2019s for you. A major plus\nis that these things won\u2019t give you a\nsevere sugar crash afterwards. Thank\nus for the improved concentration in\nlectures later.\nMost of these things can be partially\nmade the night before, and then eaten\non the walk to lectures with minimal\nutensil use (or even in the lecture theatre if you can get away with it \u2013 be\ndiscreet though, and if it says it\u2019s not\nallowed in your lecture theatre then\ndon\u2019t do it). Trust me, I\u2019ve tried!\nDressed-up Yogurt: I\u2019m a sucker for\n\ufb02avoured yogurts from time to time;\nbut this is de\ufb01nitely far better for you\nas you have more control over cost and\nthe stu\ufb00 that goes into it. Grab a small\ntub of plain yogurt (normal or Greek,\nfull-fat or low fat, we don\u2019t discrimi-nate) and slap on a couple of teaspoons\nof your favourite jam \u2013 use honey to\nsweeten. Add a handful of your favourite chopped nuts or fruit (anything\nworks) and you\u2019re good to go!\nI\u2019ve managed to whip these up in\nabout a minute when severely rushed.\nMy favourite combo both in colour\nand \ufb02avour: strawberry jam and pista-chios. To save even more time, you can\npre-chop your nuts and fruit \u2013 or you\ncould even make a serving of this the\nnight before and then grab it on your\nway out the door!\nFruit Quesadilla: Yeah, this one may\na bit of a weird-sounding idea \u2013 especially since Granny Smith apples\nreplace the meat. But cheddar cubes\nhave been known to coexist with apple chunks in salad, so it\u2019s not that\nfar-fetched. You can make part of this\nahead by prepping a \ufb02our tortilla \u2013\nscatter some grated cheddar over it\nand pre-slice your apples thinly (use\nlemon juice to stop them browning.)\nIn the morning, scatter your apple slices on the cheese-laden tortilla and top\nwith another tortilla. Blast in the microwave on high for a few minutes so\nthe cheese melts, then cut into wedges.\nArriba!\nPeanut Butter Wa\ufb04e: Forget the\nsyrup-laden wa\ufb04es you know \u2013 apart\nfrom the sugar spike/low, they\u2019re just\ntoo sticky and messy to eat on the\ngo. Spread a warm bran/whole-grain\nwa\ufb04e with peanut butter (chunky or\nsmooth, your call) and top with some\ndried fruit/extra nuts. This ensures\nthat you get your energy in a slow and\nsteady release, thanks to the peanut\nbutter. You also get a protein and \ufb01bre\nboost in this meal!\nPop Toast: We haven\u2019t gone mad trying to re-invent the wheel \u2013 these are\nbetter than Pop Tarts because you get\nso much \ufb02exibility (apart from the sugar overload of the latter, tsk tsk). For a\nbasic jam Pop Toast, butter two slices\nof bread lightly, and then top with jam\nleaving a half-inch border around the\nedges. Cut the crusts o\ufb00 and seal the\n\u201ctart\u201d by pressing the edges together\nwith a fork \u2013 just like how you would a\npie crust. Slide it into the toaster (you\nget to control how \u201cwell done\u201d you like\nit) and that\u2019s brekkie done! You could\ntry other combinations including thin-ly-sliced fruit, peanut butter, Nutella\n(for you chocoholics) \u2013 or even cream\ncheese and ham slices if you want it\nsavoury.\n(Loosely adapted from Not Without\nSalt)\nCarol Ann Cheah Food Editor\nFOOD\nDelicious \u201cgreen\u201c dishes!\nYes, the food at SAF restaurant is\ngreen, and by green I mean good to\nthe environment. Most of the dishes\nare raw, which means that they are\nprepared at temperatures below 48\u00b0C.\nYou would never believe that raw\nfood can be so exciting! We had a two\ncourse meal which included starter\nand main course.\nThis is the \ufb01rst starter, called Dolmades with Tzazyki.\nVery nice presentation but I was not\nimpressed with the taste. Very di\ufb00erent from the traditional Dolmades,\nwhich are stu\ufb00ed with rice and vegeta-bles. Instead, these are \ufb01lled with cauli\ufb02ower rice, pine nuts, cumin, lemon\njuice, and dill. They were served with\na vegan yoghurt and cucumber dip.\nWhat I did not like was the cumin,\nas I believe it overpowered the other\ngreat, fresh ingredients.\nThe second starter is the Pesto au\nPoivre. Now this was amazing! On the\nleft is the cashew cheese with the layer\nof the basil pesto, in the centre is the\nrocket salad and on the right some\nraw \ufb02axseed crackers. I cannot describe how delicious the cashew\ncheese was.

You\nsee, the last time I went I\nhad the worst date of my\nlife. Not one to judge someone for their job title, I took\nan Exotic Credit Trader at\nBarclays Capital to dinner\nfor what should have been\na stonking night out. But it\nall went wrong at the wine.\nFaced with not so much a wine list but what can better be described as a leather bound encyclopaedia of vintages, I asked my companion if she had a preference \u2013 she said she did not. \u201cRed or white?\u201d I asked. She said red. I ordered a\nbottle of Sancerre Rouge, described in the book as \u201cshowing a great finesse, the\ntannins soft and elegant.\u201d Classy, I hoped she\u2019d think. I hoped wrong. I tasted\nthe wine, it was fine. She tasted the wine, pulled a face and blurted \u201cEurgh, I\ncan\u2019t possibly drink that, it\u2019s not full-bodied enough.\u201d Stunned, not quite sure\nhow to react or what to do, I watched as she ordered her own glass of wine.\nVulgarity may be no substitute for wit, but all I could do was curse. I pretended\nto need the loo, got up, walked past the bar to pay for my wine and escaped\nfrom the restaurant.\nLast Friday, I went back with my girlfriend. And, wow, what a night! The food\nis fantastic \u2013 we had Colston Bassett Stilton ravioli (rich and warm), Hebridean\nhandpicked crab (fresh and light), Rabbit and Scottish girolles pie (creamy and\ntender) and Sirloin steak on the bone with b\u00e9arnaise sauce (proper steak, just\nhow it should be). But the greatest triumph, the truest charm of the place, was\nfirst a foot stomping piano player who assaulted the keys with tunes such as\nDon\u2019t Get Around Much Anymore and then a New Orleans style quartet blasting out numbers like When You\u2019re Smiling. The place was alive, oozing, buzz-ing, teeming with atmosphere. Restaurants like this are what makes living in a\nbig city worth all the hassle; the overcrowding, the overpriced rent. Who cares\nif it was raining outside, if the District line was partially suspended?\nTop food, top music, top company. And the wine? We drank a roaring full-bodied Sangiovese di Romagna.\nThe food review\n15 Eccleston Street\nLondon\nSW1W 9LX\nIf nothing else,\na sexy red\nCharles Betts\npink peppercorn crust on top went so\nwell together.\nAnd the main! This was a real mon-ster. I had the SAF Pad Thai and I am\nvery glad I chose it. The \ufb01rst thing that\nmade me very excited was the enoki\nmushrooms on the side of the plate\nbecause they really are expensive and\nI haven\u2019t had the chance to try them\nbefore. I was not disappointed. That\nhuge mountain is made from Julienne\nstrips of carrot, mangetout and cour-gette. It also has mung beans and spicy\ncashews, which added a great crunchy\ntexture. The chillies and the lime on\nthe side was a nice touch, ensuring\nthat both the people who like citrus\n\ufb02avours or spicy food will enjoy this\ndish to the maximum. And I should\nnot forget the Nori sheet, which made\nme believe I was eating \ufb01sh.\nI\u2019m going rogue and pouring\nLOADS of milk on the cereal\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nndon is ranked in tables\n5\nNews Editor: Aemun Reza\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\nImperial\u2019s academic sta\ufb00 are making changes to improve the NSS score but it\ntakes a few years for the cohort that is bene\ufb01ting from this to \ufb01ll out the survey in their \ufb01nal year. So we won\u2019t see immediate results but know that the\nacademic sta\ufb00 are working hard to give you a world class education, while\ntrying to improve your satisfaction.\nHowever there still is large potential for improvement and more needs to\nbe done to increase student\u2019s satisfaction, for example 86% ranked us 67th\nbut 89% would rank us 25th for satisfaction due to it being so densely populated at the top of the table. A signi\ufb01cant number of Imperial College Union\u2019s\n2011 NSS response recommendations have not been acted on and it is up to\nthe College to decide if they want to put more resources behind accomplishing these, which will result in a signi\ufb01cant rise of student satisfaction.\nThe Union is taking this seriously because unless your teacher or parent\ntells you to apply for Imperial, you are going to generally go by the league\ntables when you are 17 or 18 years old.\nSome league tables are misleading for talented prospective students, for\nexample the Guardian doesn\u2019t take into account research as a metric and\nheavily relies upon the NSS results, while using the the value added score,\nwhich is a useless metric since it measures how much a student has improved\nfrom their entry standards to their \ufb01nal graduating honours, which of course\nis an idiotic way to analyze a university where everyone gets at least three A\u2019s\nat A-level.\nThe disparity between international and national rankings is based on\nwhat they wish to assess. So international rankings focus on hard reliable\nfacts, while national rankings use unreliable student satisfaction results.\nSubject Tables Responses\nDoug Hunt\nDeputy President (Education)\nThe Guardian\nIn the overall table, Imperial College London ranks 13th. In terms of the NSS feedback score,\nImperial is 3rd from the bottom (with the bottom institution not actually having figures\nfor the NSS response). However, the entry tariff, which is the UCAS points required to be\noffered a place, is the third highest at Imperial, with only Cambridge and Oxford above.\nBelow, the infographic shows the rankings in the different subjects.\nEarth and marine sciences: 1st\nMaterials and mineral engineering: 3rd\nMechanical Engineering: 4th\nCivil Engineering: 12th\nChemical Engineering: 4th\nMedicine: 11th\nPhysics: 12th\nChemistry: 26th\nBiosciences: 11th\nEEE: 6th\nComputer Science: 4th Mathematics: 10th\nThe Complete University Guide\nWhile league tables can be met with mixed emotions, we must keep in\nmind that they in\ufb02uence perceptions of the College and inform the decisions of prospective sta\ufb00 and students. It is therefore a welcome boost that\nImperial has kept its position as the eighth best university in the world\naccording to the THE, in good company alongside three other UK universities in the top twenty. We cannot rest on our laurels but we can be\nproud that we are \ufb01rmly embedded among the world\u2019s leading univer-sities, unshaken by competition from Asia where massive investment in\nhigher education and research is paying dividends.\nFrom the Union\nFrom the College\nSir Keith O\u2019Nions\nPresident & Rector\nCompiled and written by Tim Arbabzadah and Aemun Reza\nIllustrations by Lizzy Griffiths\nIn this table, Imperial currently ranks 4th overall. In this table, Cambridge is first, with LSE\nbeing second and Oxford being 3rd. From 2010-2012, Imperial was 3rd overall, and so has\nfallen by one spot. In all of the subject tables, shown below, Imperial ranks very highly. In\nterms of graduate prospects, Imperial actually is 1st, with Cambridge coming in 2nd.\nAeronautical Engineering: 4th\nBiosciences: 3rd\nChemical Engineering: 2nd\nChemistry: 6th\nCivil Engineering: 2nd\nEEE: 4th\nGeology 2nd\nMaterials: 3rd\nMathematics: 3rd\nMechanical\nEngineering:\n4th\nMedicine: 5th\nPhysics: 5th Computer Science: 3rd\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\n28\nOn the road, to nowhere\nJohn Park Film Editor\nDirector: Walter Salles\nScreenwriters: Jacques Kerouac\n(novel), Jose Rivera\nStarring: Garrett Hedlund, Sam Riley,\nKristen Stewart, Viggo Mortensen,\nAmy Adams, Kirsten Dunst, Elizabeth\nMoss, Steve Buscemi, Alice Braga,\nTerrence Howard\nHere is a repetitive bore of a movie\nin which the three main characters\n(Hedlund, Riley and Stewart) spend\nfar too much time chasing three\nthings: alcohol, drugs and sex. Yes,\nthey\u2019re either getting drunk, getting\nhigh, or getting laid. One of them\nfancies himself as a bit of a deep-thinking writer, and he serves as the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s narrator. We see things in Sal\nParadise\u2019s (Riley) point of view, who\nrecords every single wild experience\nhe shares with various people in his\nlife.\nPlans to adapt Jack Kerouac\u2019s classic novel of the same name have been\naround for decades, and here it \ufb01nally\nis, in year 2012, with a fresh, goodlooking large ensemble that tries to\nbring out the complexities in each\ncharacter. And the talented cast does\ntruly give it their all but what this\nends up looking like is a series of arty\nshort \ufb01lms strung together with no\nreal clear sense of purpose or direc-tion. Plus it goes on for far too long,\nand without a real story to tell, even\na standard two-hour \ufb01lm feels like an\nunbearable chore.\nSal has lost his father, and whilst\nliving with a writer\u2019s block, pondering the meaning of life, meets Dean\nMoriarty (Hedlund), a suave, enigmatic youngster who he is captivated\nby. His energy, his spirit, his attitude,\njust everything about him clicks for\nsome reason, and Moriarty immediately becomes his inspiration to venture out into the world, live his life,\nand the two hit it o\ufb00 becoming best of\nfriends. The two of them travel a lot,\nand we get many shots of them driving across empty roads in America,\ncomfortably drifting along to their\nnext destination, wherever that may\nbe.\nOf course, a fair share of women\nenter the picture: Stewart is the dim,\nhorny young girlfriend of Dean, a\nshallow role the actress has played\nmany, many times in the past in the\nvampire franchise that made her a\nglobal sensation whereas Dunst tunes\nin for a \ufb01ne supporting turn as the\none woman who genuinely tries to\nmake something out of the irresponsible and reckless Dean. Braga\u2019s Terry,\na cotton picker who Sal has a brief but\npassionate a\ufb00air with, is never fully\nexplored, neither is Adams\u2019 eccentric Jane, who makes a brief cameo\nappearance but not adding anything\nsubstantial to what the \ufb01lm is trying\nto say. Four potentially interesting\ncharacters, played by four talented\nactresses, all put to no good use as the\n\ufb01lm is far too busy trying to tackle\nthe budding, complex relationship\nbetween the two men.\nBut the \ufb01lm also has trouble diving into the male leads. Dean is de\ufb01ned by the mad way with which he\nchooses to live his life. So we see a\nlot of monotonous, tedious scenes of\nDean hitting rock bottom. He drinks\na lot of spirits, smokes a lot of weed,\nand screws a lot of women. Being with\nSal ups his mood even more, and his\ndrunken antics get worse. Exactly\nwhat Sal is so captivated by is anyone\u2019s guess, and the \ufb01lm fails to truly\naddress the bond that keeps these two\ntogether.\nCredit has to go however, to the two\nactors with an enormous burden of\nbringing to life the two aimless drifters who are di\ufb03cult to \ufb01gure out.\nRiley, driving the narrative forward\nwith his narration, conveys a lot of\nfeelings during his time of growth\nand change, always keeping us updated with what is going on, when, why,\nwhere and how. Although the real\nrevelation and breakout star here has\nto be Hedlund, who brings out such\nnatural, classic alpha-male macho\ncharisma so readily to his role, and\nthe untamed ways he goes about his\nlife is captured with much dedication\nand power. But his impressive range\ndoesn\u2019t end there, as he also brings\nout the more grounded, tender side\nof his character, a calmer alternative\nthat is rarely shown. It\u2019s obvious he\nhas trouble following him wherever\nhe goes, and he does have several moments of rather depressing revelation,\nintermittent reality checks, that tell\nhim no good can come out of any of\nthis. This is where the more sensitive expression of Hedlund\u2019s superb\nshowing stirs up a lot of sympathy\nand emotions which are otherwise\nvery lacking in the \ufb01lm\u2019s dry duration.\nBasically, it all comes down to the\ntwo kids needing to grow up and\nface the harsh truths of life. And no\nprizes for guessing who comes out as\nthe eventual winner, and who needs\nto come grovelling back after his futile attempts to lead the more \u201cfun\u201d\nyears don\u2019t quite work out. And due to\nbarely developed characters and a super\ufb01cial look at their relationships, it\nis di\ufb03cult to feel anything for anyone\nin the end.

And every morning, no\nmatter how gentle my intentions as I\nleft home, I\u2019d arrive at the lab a sweaty\nmess, after half an hour of silly commuter racing on my rattling, pannier-laden bike.\nBy the spring, I wanted to enter a\ntriathlon. Come summer, another\nrunning injury and several conferences had meant I\u2019d missed out on both\nBUCS triathlon events. Still, the itch\nneeded scratching so I looked at the\ncalendar and picked a race, \ufb01nally opting for the \u2018Olympic\u2019 distance: 1500m\nlake swim, 40km bike on country\nroads, and 10km run around a park.\nIt turned out to be the Triathlon England National Championships. Was I\neven allowed? Hmm ... nothing about\nany qualifying times... I\u2019d just have to\ngo and do it, and hope to be swept\nalong by the super-\ufb01t crowd sometime\nin the process.\nBlessed are those who race with a\nclub. I look forward to the camaraderie and minibus transport of the\nTriIC 2012/13 racing season. Getting to this race was a lonely faff: up\nat 3am to drink coffee, eat porridge,\nget my borrowed bike and a heap of\nkit into the car, and drive to Milton\nKeynes in the dark. I was so convinced I\u2019d forgotten something that\nI asked a stranger to check over my\nkit.\nThe race begins with a mass of\ncompetitors treading water in the\nlake, going off in several batches or\n\u2018waves\u2019 separated by 10 minutes.\nEveryone knows you can slipstream\non a bike, but I was surprised to\nlearn you can do the same swimming\n--- something I only realised after\nan annoying training session where\nsomeone kept swimming up behind\nme and tickling my feet, then slowing down as soon as he overtook.\nIn open water there\u2019s another reason\nto \u2018\ufb01nd a good pair of feet\u2019 and follow\nthem: it helps you navigate when your\ngoggles have fogged up. Alas, it\u2019s dif\ufb01cult to do in opaque water, and possibly cheating, so I mostly splashed my\nown way round, at a conservative pace\nsince\u2013even for a girl who loves a swim\nwith the swans in Hyde Park\u2013hyperventilating in the middle of a big deep\nlake sounds scary. Volunteer marshals\ndragged us up the slippery exit ramp\nas we \ufb01nished swimming. No matter:\nI had already traded my dignity for a\nwetsuit.\nNext task: removing said wetsuit.\nAfter a dispiriting session in my parents\u2019 garden with a tube of KY jelly\nand a hosepipe, I found the perfect\nlubricant (it\u2019s called BodyGlide), so\nthis was a breeze. I even remembered\nwhere my bike was parked. Swim hat\no\ufb00, goggles o\ufb00, helmet on, shoes on,\nslurp some sugary goo, grab the bike,\nget going, stop to tie forgotten shoe-lace, get going again, out onto the road\nwhere I am allowed to jump onto the\nbike and I\u2019m free, chest heaving, pedalling out into the countryside and\ntrying to get a bottle of sugary drink\ndown ASAP because I know if I leave\nit to just before the run, it won\u2019t stay\ndown.\nWith most of the drink spilt down\nmy front and legs, I gave up on it and\nput my head down. In this, as in most\ntriathlons, riding in someone else\u2019s\nslipstream was illegal. There\u2019s an exclusion zone of a few metres around\neach cyclist; you can overtake as long\nas you don\u2019t spend more than 15 seconds in that imaginary box. Despite\nvarious tactical quandaries, it turned\nout the bike was my strongest leg: the\nsun came out and I was able to overtake some people.\nA veteran triathlete had advised me\npreviously that \u2018the run is just about\nholding it together\u2019. With jelly legs\nand stomach cramps, all I could do\nwas put one foot in front of the other and hope that meant I was going\nforwards. It was horrible, but I liked\nit. By lap 2 of 3 it was hot and a man\nwith a hosepipe appeared and started\nsprinkling us. Ladies of ambiguous\nleg-letter overtook me and smiled\nsweetly. Later I heard footsteps behind me winding up for a sprint \ufb01nish\nso I hoofed it o\ufb00 up the \ufb01nal straight,\nbut it turned out to be a ghost.\nI did the whole race without seeing a\nwatch, bike computer, or clock - even\nthe one at the \ufb01nish line was broken\n- but expected to \ufb01nish in anything\nbetween 2:30 and 3 hours. Imagine\nmy delight, therefore, to \ufb01nd I snuck\nround in 2:28:57! Clearly, champagne\nand Doritos are the way forward in endurance sports nutrition.\nWe clapped in the last \ufb01nisher, who\nwon a \u2018\ufb01rst prize\u2019 and got the biggest\ncheer of the day (since separate prizes\nare given in each \ufb01ve-year age-band)\nwhen it occurred to me to ask about\nshowers. \u201cMost people just jump back\nin the lake\u201d, they said\u2013 silly me!\u2013and I\ndived back in to rinse o\ufb00 the sweat and\nlemonade. I think I\u2019m hooked.\nImperial Wolverines dodge victory\nThe Imperial Wolverines had a fantastic start to their season with both\nteams taking home medals after a sus-pense-riddled day in Hat\ufb01eld.\nThe morning started o\ufb00 in standard\nfashion, with the Wolverines discovering the endless delays away from Hyde\nPark due to the Royal Parks half mara-thon, culminating in an hour-long\ndetour taking them on a stressful tour\nof Central London. However, the ev-er-reliable driver Alan Soltani maxed\nout the minibus\u2019s solid top speed of\n62mph in his desire to get to the venue\non time, driven on by a strengthening\nurge to go to the toilet (despite repeated refusals to just stop at a petrol sta-tion) and to prove he could drive for\nlonger than 5 minutes without stalling\n(which he de\ufb01nitely couldn\u2019t).\nThus the Wolverines turned up\nfashionably late, arriving in Hat\ufb01eld in\nshirts and ties with just 20 minutes till\nthe \ufb01rst matches kicked o\ufb00. The team\nwas looking pretty \ufb02y, apart from Justin \u2018The Defendant\u2019 Ioanna, thinking\nthat matching a shirt and tie with jogging bottoms and trainers was a good\nlook. Blunder.\nBoth teams struggled to warm up\nin time, with the 2nd team unfortunately losing all three of their group\nmatches placing them into the playo\ufb00\nstages, while the 1st team won the \ufb01rst\nand the \ufb01nal matches and just lost the\nsecond group match against eventual\nwinners The Meteors.\nThe 1sts then played a relatively easy\nQuarter Final game before coming up\nagainst their rivals Reepham Raiders\nin the Semis in a best-of-7 match. This\nwas always going to be close, but the\nWolverines came out on top, thanks\nto some hard hits from Jan \u2018Janimal\u2019\nKosco. Meanwhile, the 2nd team were\ncruising through the \u2018best of the rest\u2019\nmatches, and despite several calls of\nquestionable re\ufb03ng from the opposi-tion, made it to the playo\ufb00 \ufb01nal.\nAfter witnessing a beautiful double\ncatch from Zain Abbas and Justin Ioanna during the 2nd team\u2019s demolition of Bedfordshire Mixed Bulls II to\nwin the playo\ufb00 medal, it was the turn\nof the 1sts to face The Meteors once\nagain in an attempt to do the double\nfor the Wolverines, and win only their\nsecond-ever tournament in club his-tory. The only time the 1sts have ever\nplayed The Meteors twice in one day\nwas at East Anglia, where the Wolverines won their \ufb01rst ever gold medal.\nWere The Meteors about to win their\n\ufb01rst ever gold in the same fashion and\nbeat us for the second time?\nUnfortunately it was not to be for\nthe Wolverines. Despite solid performances across the team, the expertise\nof the Imperial Alumnus Adam Cutmore as well as the fastest-recorded\nthrower in the UK proved too much\nfor the 1sts, losing 4-2 to take home\nsilver.\nMan of the tournament for the 2nds\nwas Will Robinson for his superb\ncatching and countering, whereas\nfor the 1sts it was a tie between Alan\nSoltani for his club record-breaking\n4 catches in one game and Steve\nNdumbe for some strong throwing.\nCongratulations must also be given to\nJan Kosco and Nuno \u2018Too Easy\u2019 Cunha\nfor their excellent debuts for the 1sts\nand 2nds respectively, and to Tom\nPeake for his incredible leadership as\n1st VI Captain for the \ufb01rst time (even\nAlan \u2018The Dictator\u2019 Soltani listened to\nhim (most of the time\u2026)). Overall, it\nwas a solid start to the season for the\nWolverines, who are hoping to build\non this performance with the help of\nsome amazing fresher talent. Here\u2019s to\na successful year!

    "content": "A DayZ by any other name...\nRoss Webster is looking for friendlies in Cherno\nombie games have taken\nall shapes and sizes over\nthe years, from Wiibased Evil Dead-style\ngames within the Resident Evil universe (Umbrella Chronicles) to frantic rooftop gun\ufb01ghts in\nthe Left 4 Dead series. They all bring\nin the element of isolation into the\nmix, surrounded by crumbling cities\nand smoking ruins, but they just manage to miss that feeling of desperation\n- you die, and then you respawn or re-load, not that far back.\nEnter DayZ (pronounced day-zed, or\nday-zee depending on your horoscope\nand the phases of Jupiter\u2019s moons) \u2013\na zombie survival simulator. Firstly,\na little bit of background. DayZ is a\nmod for Armed Assault 2 (ArmA 2),\na military combat simulator. The base\ngame, developed by Bohemia Interactive, is massive \u2013 hundreds of realistically modelled weapons and vehicles,\nalong with bullet physics and wind directions \u2013 and has been quite popular\nwithin the mil-sim community, since\nits release back in 2009. One of Bohemia\u2019s developers started making DayZ\nfor fun, and it quickly went viral, pushing the lacklustre Steam sales of ArmA\n2 to the top of the charts for months\n(quite a feat for a 3-year old niche\ngame) during spring/summer 2012.\nSo, the game. You (and up to 39 other\nplayers, depending on the server size)\nare stranded in 225km2 of pseudo-Russian countryside. You can go anywhere and do anything. There are stories of kidnappings, urban legends and\nlarge clan-battles in the larger cities.\nAs a fresh-spawn, you start with some\nodds and ends, including a torch, a\nbandage and a box of painkilers (earli-er versions of the mod had you spawn\nwith a pistol) and that\u2019s it. You have to\nscavenge the rest of your equipment,\nbut the problem is that the best loot\nis found in the more once-populated\nareas of Chernarus. Or other player\u2019s\nbodies. The closer you get to a built-up area, the more zombies spawn\naround you. \u201cFine\u201d you might say, \u201cI\u2019ll\njust shoot them all and if I run out of\nammo, I\u2019ll just run away\u201d. Good luck\nwith that, little Timmy. The predators of Chernarus are not your jovial,\nslow-moving zombies; they are the 28\nXs Later (where X is a unit of time)\nstyle of zombie that will run at you,\nzig-zagging like a ziggy-zaggy thing.\nZombies are attracted by noise, so by\nthe time you\u2019ve killed your groupies,\nthe next lot is on the horizon, running\nstraight for you. When you die, you\nrespawn along the south, or southeast coastline, back with the original\nstarting equipment. Death is mean-ingful. This isn\u2019t a game you can win.\nThe aim is to live as long as possible.\nThe base game is buggy, with zombies being able to walk and melee\nthrough concrete walls. Lying down\non the ground can break your legs,\nand lag issues can cause you to go \ufb02ying. As such, a standalone version of\nDayZ, has started development, which\nwill hopefully remove the majority of\nengine problems and other game-play\nissues such as people alt-F4-ing in\nthe middle of a \ufb01re\ufb01ght, as to not die.\nDouchenozzles.\nSome people don\u2019t like the countryside \u2013 maybe it\u2019s the parachuting\ncows, or the rocks that look like peo-ple. Maybe they have allergies. Those\npeople have been working on more\nmaps for DayZ, and have brought us\nthe bottle-necked-by-bridges island\nof Lingor, and the city of Fallujah.\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 instead of rolling hills\nand 30-minute runs between villages,\nthe whole map is a massive city, with\nloot and zombie spawns all over the\nplace (it\u2019s not too kind on your computer though, if you like things looking pretty).\nNow, in all the lives I\u2019ve had, it\u2019s not\nbeen the bugs that have killed me the\nmost, nor the zombies. It\u2019s everyone\nelse trying to survive, who thinks that\nit\u2019s a good idea to shoot an unarmed\nfreshly-spawned player. But then,\nthat\u2019s simple humanity for you - kill all\nyour competitors, no matter the chal-lenge. I\u2019m not bitter at all.\nBeing a survival game, its not just\nbullets and teeth that can mess up\nyour murder-streak (your HUD shows\nzombie kills, PC kills a.k.a. murders,\ntemperature, number of zombies on\nthe server, etc) but you also have to\nworry about hunger (assuaged by cans\nof beans or pasta), thirst, bone break-ages, blood loss and a bad case of the\nsni\ufb04es (no, really. Let your temperature drop too low for too long, and\nyou\u2019ll catch an nasty infection).\nTeam-work is the name of the game\n\u2013 your limited inventory allows for\nlittle hoarding, so making camp sites\nwith tents, and spreading the work\nload over multiple servers can make\nyour life easier, especially when it\ncomes to \ufb01nding parts to repair your\nhelicopters and ATVs. Trusting your\ngroup to shoot the hostile PCs and\nzombies, rather than yourself is quite\na hurdle (especially with no easy way\nto recognise a player), and is one of\nthe reasons I love DayZ. It\u2019s actually a\ngame where I fear dying.\nI truly love the slow approach that\nyou can take to the game running and\ngunning results in premature deathu-lation and the patient, slow and steady\nroute gets you the best loot and gives\nyou the best chances. Keeping quiet\nand out of the way is often the wisest\ntactic.\nThe bean wars have been long and\npainful, but remember that your enemies may take our brains, but they\u2019ll\nnever take our FREEDOM!\nZ\nGAMES\nNext Week\u2019s Felix\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER 29\nGames Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDayZ Diaries\nDay Two\nDear Diary,\nSomething\u2019s wrong with the world.\nI dragged the body into the woods, to leave it for the wildlife. The adrenaline had worn o\ufb00 from our earlier altercation, and I\u2019d made my peace with\nhis crumpled remains, when I heard some rustling behind me.\nI turned around with my axe out and saw nothing apart from \ufb01re\ufb02ies,\nbouncing around in the distance, and heard nothing apart from the roar of\nthe sea and the crickets in the night. It was getting cold, and I looked to \ufb01nd\nsomewhere that was dry and didn\u2019t smell of death.\nI kept on walking \u2013 west, I think \u2013 but I let my mind wander. Never again.\nI didn\u2019t hear them until it was too late \u2013 the men standing around me, with\nchem-lights clipped to their bags, and axes in their hands. A few seconds\nlater and it all went black. I awoke, tied to a tree and aware of the heat on\nmy face, and the glow through my eyelids. Fire. I didn\u2019t notice at \ufb01rst, over\nthe crackling of the logs, but there was a murmuring. It was as if you asked\nsomeone to speak as quiet as humanly possible, but without resorting to\nwhispering, and the noise was everywhere. I was surrounded. I couldn\u2019t\nmake out what they were saying. If it was a man-made language, I had never\nheard it before. I pray I never hear it again.\nA bespectacled man with a heavily scarred face and a pair of round reading glasses crouched down in front of me and pulled out a knife \u2013 an old\nmilitary-issue knife, I believe. Maybe this is the remainder of our armed\nforces? He was chanting, until he pointed the knife at my throat, and moved\nan index \ufb01nger up to his lips, like I was being let in on a 5-year old\u2019s big\nsecret I shouldn\u2019t be telling anyone. I\u2019m pretty sure his parents wouldn\u2019t\nbe happy.\nConsidering the slit throat of the woman on the next tree over, I nodded.\nTwo arms from behind me removed the bonds, and lifted me from the tree,\ntowards the \ufb01re. I was brought towards a makeshift altar \u2013 the hood of a\ncar, bent over a pile of logs. Candles had been lit and were placed at the ends\nof the table, where the spread of molten candle wax had dried with streaks\nof red. I was forced down to my knees, and my head was held down onto\nthe cold, rusty surface. I could feel my pulse quickening, and the adrenaline pumping again, drowning out the chanting and the spitting \ufb01re. The\nlibrarian-turned-serial killer moved to the opposite side of the altar and\nheld the knife to my neck, the cold metal of Death\u2019s scythe wavering millimetres away from the darkness.\nThe chief gave a guttural scream and my vision \ufb01lled with blood, as the\ncrimson sprayed over the altar, covering the candles.\nHis body slumped onto the table, and I felt the grip on my shoulders\nloosen and fall away. More shouts and screams \ufb01lled the air, as bodies fell to\nthe ground. From the darkness, 4 men came out, alert and in military uni-form. The one in front, with a blue-painted face and aviator glasses came\nup to me, lowered his weapon and said \u201cCome with me if you want to live.\u201d\nHis sentiments were echoed by his cohort, with calls of \u201cLOL\u201d, \u201cepic\u201d and\n\u201cYou better not be another crazy axe murderer.\u201d\nI smiled, and grabbed my new friend by the hand. It looks like Death has\nother plans for me.\nNext Week\u2019s Felix\nWe\u2019re reviewing FTL, discussing the role of girls within gaming culture, and may-be, maybe we\u2019ll throw in a review of Borderlands 2. Because we like you. Some\nof you, at least.\nMeanwhile, I hope you\u2019re all clocking up your hours in the Planetside 2 Beta,\nand getting ready to play Dishonored. I\u2019ll be sitting here eating Maoam.\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\necause that\u2019s what feminism\u2019s all about, right?\nRight? Wrong, but from\nthe incredulous looks,\ncomments and questions\nwe got at Freshers\u2019 Fair, it seems like a\nlot of you really believe that the goals\nof feminism are to overthrow and subjugate men and introduce a gynocratic\nfempire. Consider your entrance to Imperial and this article your welcome to\nreality. You\u2019re in the real world now, and\nyou\u2019re here to learn. So, get learning:\nWhat actually is feminism, then?\nThe belief that men and women should\nhave equal rights and should not be\njudged based on their gender. Nothing\nmore, nothing less. It\u2019s not about female\nsupremacism or misandry: it\u2019s about\nequality.\nBut men and woman are equal! Sexism doesn\u2019t exist any more.\nNo, they aren\u2019t: a quick look at Imperial\u2019s gender ratio will show you that\nwomen are still encouraged away from\n\u201chard\u201d subjects. In business and politics women are underpaid and under-represented, with each becoming more\nmale-dominated further up the ladder.\nTheir appearance, weight and personal\nlives are obsessed over (see this paper\u2019s\ncomments on Louise Mensch last year),\nand they are frequently victims of har-assment, sexual assault, and rape.\nMen are oppressed too: look at how\nfew men get custody in divorce cases!\nAlso, men can be raped and abused as\nwell.\nWe know, and we care about these is-sues. Yes, really. Feminists believe in\nMandatory castrations for all!\nKeir Little\n32\nThe Feminist Society and why it might not be what you think it is\nequality for all genders: our society tells\nus that women, not men, should care for\nchildren, and thus women get custody\n(although in fact, when men bother to\n\ufb01ght for custody, the majority get it).\nFeminists want this to change. As for\nmale rape and abuse? Of course, we\nwant those to end too, but they have a\nsmall incidence compared to similar\nabuse against women, which is why\nyou\u2019ll hear us talking about them less.\nI\u2019m an equalist/humanist because\nI care about all issues, so I\u2019m not a\nfeminist.\nYes, you are. \u201cFeminism,\u201d although\nabout equality, gets its name from the\nfact that women are currently the oppressed gender, and when the movement started, were truly second-class\ncitizens, unable to vote, buy property or\nget an o\ufb03cial education. So, what about\nracism, homophobia, transphobia and\nother forms of bigotry? Those are issues we care about as well, and in many\ncases, there\u2019s a big overlap with them\nand feminism: this is something we call\nintersectionality.\nI heard feminists believe X.\nThere is no singular de\ufb01ning philosophy\nor belief in feminism, save for gender\nequality.

When I wanted rock & roll, I got\nbaroque. Admire conventional wisdom as sacrosanct and do not touch. Unfortunately, it took years for me to gain any sort of interest in classical music,\nand when I did, it was decidedly towards the anarchic end of the spectrum.\nDespite the polite waltzes and majestic sonatas of centuries past, the shape of\nmodern composition takes an altogether more tumultuous form.\nThis convention is what deteriorates the so-called \u201cserious music, domesticated under the barbarous name of classical so as to enable one to turn away\nfrom it again in comfort,\u201d as Theodor Adorno put it in his essay, On the Fetish\nCharacter of Music and the Regression of Listening. In fact, not only the audience but even the composers grew tired of the servile rectitude of the simplis-tic, predictable, and almost patronizing plays of harmony. One Arnold Schoenberg, all but single-handedly banished conventionality in music with his\ntwelve-tone technique, dubbed serialism, decidedly defenestrating tonality\naltogether. His cacophonic approach was equally revered and reviled by the\nnew and old respectively. Regardless, it came at a time when music was more\nhackneyed than ever. Opening our ears to atonality was a way of breaking free\nfrom convention and exploring new ground in an agoraphobic art.\nBefore this explosion into unknown territory, some composers had already\nbegun to unravel the creases in the partiture. Hungarian B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k is said to\nhave been the first to use a method akin to serialism in 1908, before Schoenberg concretized it in 1921. Two years before, Richard Strauss sonified perversions on biblical characters, which culminated in necrophilia, in his opera\nSalom\u00e9 based on the play by Oscar Wilde. His most famous work, Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, was inspired by the Nietzsche\u2019s opus, which claimed that \u201cGod\nis dead.\u201d Later, Igor Stravinsky would incite a riot in the concert hall with his\norchestral ballet The Rite of Spring. Truly, the times of genteel eloquence and\npompous balladry were now reserved for the ignorantly arrogant.\nAfter the collapse of Europe in the wake of WWII, when harmonic excess\nand euphoric beauty was no longer fit to entice the hearts of a broken con-tinent, a new resurgence in dissonance took form. Krzysztof Penderecki\u2019s\nThrenody to the Victims of Hiroshima is perhaps one of the most chilling and\nillustrative documents of the zeitgeist. The violins open with a single chord,\nmerging a million crying voices into one agonized shrill, shivering in terror.\nThe cacophony quickly falls apart as the glissandos turn to staccatos like collapsing footsteps, eventually giving way to a void of silence. These elements\npermeate the entire piece, painting a terrifying vision of man\u2019s greatest discovery turned into its greatest misfortune. The pristine face of the orchestra\nturned into an ominous and macabre portrait of the depths of mankind. The\nlistener was plunged beneath the safe space between whole notes and half-tones, into a flood of dissonance and conflicting harmonics. Yet this was not\nmerely a chaotic mass. The dissonance induces a calculated state of terror. It\nwas mankind recoiling at the mere thought of itself. Something stranger than\ntaboo, something seemingly unnatural, but so innate.\nThis tendency towards abstraction from our imperfect nature was further\nelevated by Iannis Xenakis. Xenakis used his training as an architect to make\nup for his lack of musical background. After fleeing his natal Greece, following\nthe ruination wrought the fascists (where the then student\u2019s visage was severely disfigured while fighting in the resistance), he found a place in Parisian\nbrutalist-extraordinaire Le Corbusier\u2019s architecture studio. Not long thereafter he met composer Olivier Messiaen (who famously scored bird songs for\norchestra) who spurred the anxious expat to use the tools at his disposal to\npursue his musical passion, even when a classical education had been missing.\nXenakis used his knowledge of structural engineering and stochastic processes - such as those found in nature, from bird flight to cellular organization - to\nextract music from the rigid foundations of mathematics. His most famous\npiece, Metastasis was composed using the same formulas as those used in designing the emblematic Phillips Pavilion for the 1958 World Expo in Brussels.\nThe New Yorker\u2019s Alex Ross recently recounted these tremors of the XX\nCentury in his book The Rest is Noise. The Southbank Centre are curating a\nfestival from January to June of next year inspired by the Pulitzer Prize finalist.\nIt features concerts from many of the above, as well as more manageable and\ncertainly more beautiful works by Debussy, Mahler, Prokofiev, Satie and\ncountless others. If you ever felt a curiosity but never dared confront the vastness of the repertoire, this may help to make some sense of it all.\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\n24\nMS Paint Comp!\nCan you name the album covers that we\u2019ve reproduced with the accuracy of that Spanish woman who tried to fix the painting of Jesus?\nSend us your answers to the 12 album covers drawn above to music.\nfelix@gmail.com.

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\n14\nRCSU on top\nPlabon Saha says: seriously, we stole everyone\u2019s shit\nFresher\u2019s Fair 2012 saw an\nunprecedented rise in mas-cotry and the RCSU-CGCU\nrivalry was re-ignited with a\nburning vengeance. After the\ncapture of the ICSMU\u2019s Phoenix head\nlast year the RCSU went a step further\nas it is currently holding onto City and\nGuild Union\u2019s Bolt and Spanner and the\nICSMU\u2019s Phoenix feet. However, it pains\nme to say that our beloved mascot Theta\nwas violated as well and one of its four\nparts is currently in the hands of the dirty\nengineers in CGCU.\nAfter numerous failed attempts by the\nengineers to steal Theta during fresh-ers fair they \ufb01nally struck gold (or steel)\nwhen I was taking Theta apart. Michele\nTonutti, the CGCU Events O\ufb03cer ran\no\ufb00 with a pole while someone else ran o\ufb00\nwith the bulb. By the time the bulb had\nbeen recovered, Michele was safely away\nto the CGCU o\ufb03ce, which was only a\n\ufb02ight of stairs away. The irony of the situation is that Theta was being taken apart\njust so it can be safely put away.\nFurther e\ufb00orts were made by other committee members to \ufb01nd a way to make\nTheta whole and once we realized that\nour e\ufb00ort was going in vain, the committee decided to exact revenge on the\nCGCU by stealing their mascot. Despite\nCGCU members\u2019 watchful eye, RCSU\nEvents O\ufb03cer Ali Ibrahim was able to\nswipe the 35kg Bolt and bolted for the\ndoor where he met resistance in the form\nofMicheleTonutti.Butatthispointasix-way tussle broke out near the Mech Eng\nentrance to Dalby Court as other RCSU\ncommittee members rushed to Ali\u2019s\nhelp. They helped to pin Michele down\non the \ufb02oor and Ali was able to safely\n\ufb02ee with the bolt. Michele was later seen\ndistraught alongside Bolt bearer Yuchen\nWang.\nFurthermore on Wednesday night,\nCGCU\u2019s hope of salvaging any form\nof pride vanished as their Spanner was\ncaptured. With the Spanner bearer\nMelanie Singh intoxicated, I was able to\nconvince her to let me borrow her college card, which gave me a sure-\ufb01re way\ninto the CGCU o\ufb03ce. While on a mission to retrieve Theta, I found the Spanner carelessly lying on the \ufb02oor. Unable\nto \ufb01nd Theta\u2019s missing part I decided to\nmake-do with the Spanner, which leaves\nCGCU mascotless. In other news, during Fresher\u2019s Fair the Medics also lost a\npart of their mascot to RCSU. During\nmid-day Ali and I made our way to SAF\nfor reconnaissance as we tried to locate\nPhoenix. At this point we were spotted\nby some medics and were escorted out of\nthe area. However, I was cunningly lying\nin wait and went back half an hour later\nto \ufb01nd the feet of the Phoenix carelessly\nlying under one of the desks. I made a\nquick grab for it and made a run for it\nbefore the medics could realise what\nhit them. The ransom demands for the\nPhoenix are the \ufb01rst four terms of the\nmascot negotiations where \u201cCGCU\u201d is to\nbe replaced by \u201cICSMSU\u201d\n.\nRCSUPresidentJamesTsimwantstouse\nthis chance to issue a warning to all the\nfaculty unions that the RCSU\u2019s love for\nTheta is eternal and the lengths we\u2019ll go\nto protect it is immeasurable. As evident\nby the mascotless CGCU\u2019s hopeless situ-ation, anyone who tries to violate Theta\nshould know that the RCSU will show no\nmercy. We will look for you, we will \ufb01nd\nyou, and we WILL HAVE REVENGE.\nF\nUndercover reporting allows for the\nscythe of truth to cut through wrongdoings like a wieldy knife through\nbutter. Corruption can be unmasked!\nBureaucracy criticized! All with a single tap of the keyboard, preferably followed by several more. But how could\none possibly decide what deserving\ntargets to strike? The answer, in this\ncase, was determined by the fact that\nthere was nothing better to do on\nTuesday night. The \ufb01ckle \ufb01nger of fate\nfell upon the RCSU Autumn Ball, held\nat Soho\u2019s Gem Bar.\nWhat deadly secrets would the\nevent be hiding? None, it turns out.\nFor the uninitiated out there, all\nstudents of the natural sciences belong to the Royal College of Science\nUnion, or RCSU. The Autumn Ball\nmarked one of the ongoing festivities\nof its \u2018Freshers\u2019 Fortnight\u2019, which concluded with its \u2018Buddies Bar Night\u2019 on\nThursday. But anyway, to business.\nWas it worth it?\nThe RCSU has undoubtedly had\nsomewhat of a legacy in the past year\nor two, racking up events with astronomical bar tabs. Could the new\ncommittee compete? With three free\ndrinks on o\ufb00er for a \u00a312 ticket, it certainly allowed for easy mingling to\n\ufb01nd out just what people thought of\nthe event themselves. Luckily I\u2019d been\nto a networking event earlier in the\nevening \u2013 ironically, of course. Armed\nwith a repertoire of buzzwords and\ncatchphrases that would make Roy\nWalker balk, my newly acquired skills\nin jargon and my own sheer natural\ncharisma saw me through.\nI avoided asking certain individuals about what they studied or what\nyear they were in, but instead went\nfar more profound, o\ufb00ering such\nscintillating brainteasers designed to\nstimulate and evoke a deep response.\n\u201cWhat do YOU hope to gain from tonight\u2019s event?\u201d \u201cWhat do YOU think\nabout the economy?\u201d The questions\n\ufb02owed and the answers ranged from\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d to \u201cI can\u2019t hear\nyou,\u201d due to the music. (Top marks for\nremembering to have music, RCSU\nfolks! I literally cannot fault the fact\nthat there was music in a club envi-ronment.)\nWhile some events in the past have\nbeen a bit crowded, the choice of venue this time was de\ufb01nitively spacious.\nIn the words of Another compatriot\nremarked that it was \u201cpretty big.\u201d\nAnd yet\u2026 and yet the opening\nstrains of R Kelly\u2019s seminal classic\n\u2018Bump n\u2019 Grind\u2019 were cruelly snatched\naway by a far less musically interesting composition. Seeking solace away\nfrom this crushing disappointment, I\nventured outside.\nThe RCSU\u2019s perennial \ufb01re engine Jezebel turned up to o\ufb00er rides\naround the Soho backstreets to interested parties, and then drove o\ufb00 by\nmidnight, presumably because it was\npast its bedtime.\n\u201cIt was great riding it and all but I\nthought we were going to head down\nOxford Street at 60mph,\u201d complained\na second year Biochemistry student,\ndemonstrating a clear lack of knowledge about speed limits.\nEvents took a sour turn when my\nfreshly pressed chinos su\ufb00ered the\nmisfortune of coming into contact\nwith what could, in retrospect, have\nbeen a pile of salt, judging by the hideous white mark I found on them on\nthe bus back. How a pile of salt wound\nits way into such an establishment\nwill undoubtedly remain a mystery,\nbut I implore the committee to investigate ways to prevent this kind of\nmishap from happening again.\nI could say that the event was lifea\ufb03rming, but unfortunately I\u2019m not\nstudying for a degree in hyperbole. It\nwas the one below life-a\ufb03rming. Two\nthumbs up.\nOne night, in Gem bar\nFelix sends undercover reporter MC H\u00e4mmer on a night out...\nPlabon grabbing his spanner, as always...\nThe RCSU is issuing the following\nransom demands to CGCU:\n1. The CGCU President will come to the\nnext RCSU Bar Night and do a Fresher\u2019s\nYard.\n2. An E-mail must be sent out to the\nFaculty by the President where the sole\npurpose of the e-mail is to accept RCSU\u2019s\nsuperiority.\n3. \u00a3200 must be donated to RCSU Rag.\n4. The CGCU will buy a keg for the next\nRCSU Bar Night.\n5. The missing part of Theta will be safely\nreturned.\n6. The President and the Spanner and\nBolt Bearers must go through a form of\npublic shaming at the next RCSU Bar\nNight where they must stand at the entrance in ragged clothes and hang their\nheads in shame while wearing signs\naround their necks claiming RCSU\u2019s\nsuperiority.\nA quick panoramic view of the venue\n\n"

However, the criticism\nwasn\u2019t about the subjective conceptual hang-ups or reasonable di\ufb00erences\nof opinion that the right and left usually bandy back and forth.\nIn his \u201cConscience of a Liberal\u201d\nblog, Paul Krugman put the match to\nthe powder keg, asserting that Ferguson\u2019s premeditated aim was to mislead\nreaders. In typical fashion Krugman\nused a concise and incisive example\nto make his point. After dealing with\nFerguson, Krugman set his red pen\nupon Newsweek itself, saying:\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about ideology or\neven economic analysis here \u2014 just a\nplain misrepresentation of the facts,\nwith an August publication letting itself be used to misinform readers. The\nTimes would require an abject correction if something like that slipped\nthrough. Will Newsweek?\u201d\nFor Ferguson, fact checks sprang\nup like cold sores with most major\nnews organizations delivering salty\nimpugnments of his article almost\nline by line. Matthew O\u2019Brien\u2019s piece\nin The Atlantic lays out a play-by-play\nof the article with accompanying commentary from a fact check carried out\nby the news team.\nFerguson set out to deliver a blistering condemnation of Obama. With\na little directed oversight, truncation and manipulation he was able\nto \ufb01t a square peg into a round hole.\nHis accusations against the President\nwere so egregious that hyperbole was\nbound to be afoot. Any public o\ufb03cial\nguilty of such incompetence would\nlikely be impeached, castrated and\ncruci\ufb01ed in a public square. With a\ncareer chock-full of adulation and\nfawning students, Ferguson likely believed that his piece would be a feather\nin his mortarboard. On the contrary,\nit has ended up undermining his cred-ibility. It was a takedown piece turned\non its head. Through his tendentious,\nmisrepresentative attempt at a coup\nde grace, Ferguson ended up snook-ering himself. A humbling experience for a man used to getting patted\non the back. How could he put such\na cultivated reputation on the line?\nThis can\u2019t be an easy blow for a profes-sor; the veracity of his highfalutin de-meanour now in question every time\nhe enters the classroom.\nEnough about Ferguson \u2013 despite\nhis questionable lack of judgment,\nhe is still one the most thought pro-Joseph Kaupp\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\n30\nN\nFerguson, Newsweek and the\nHuffington-postisation of the News\nAny public\nofficial guilty\nof such\nincompetence\nwould likely\nbe impeached,\ncastrated and\ncrucified in a\npublic square\nvoking historians kicking about. His\nbook, Civilization, is a testament to\nthat fact. So, how about Newsweek\nthen? Are they desperate enough to\npublish such a cheesecloth piece of\nwork? Are they cavalier enough to\nlet such a dubious article \ufb01nd its way\non to the cover without a scrupulous\nfact check? The Daily Beast has put\nup a short video clip with Justine\nRosenthal, Executive Editor of Newsweek, discussing the piece. The clip\nis quick to point out the commercial\nsuccess of Ferguson\u2019s article. It boasts\nof making it to the top of Drudge Report as well as accruing 10,000 likes\non Facebook.\nWhile Krugman is justi\ufb01ed in most\nof his accusations, he is wrong in\nclaiming that Newsweek was somehow\na pawn in Ferguson\u2019s game. Newsweek\nisn\u2019t new to the rodeo. They knew\nthe storm that was coming. Not only\ndid they know it \u2013 they orchestrated\nit from the moment they called up\nFerguson and asked him \u201cwhat is the\nnext big thing that you want to say?\u201d\nNewsweek is primarily a business, run\nby businessmen. (The news business\nand the newsmen fall somewhere\nfurther down the hierarchy.) The cost\nand the bene\ufb01ts for \u201cHit the Road,\nBarack\u201d were undoubtedly weighed.\nThis article, along with others, such as\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s \u2018Oh Sh*t\u2019 Moment,\u201d signal\na shift in Newsweek\u2019s strategy toward\nthe \u2018Hu\ufb03ngtonpostization\u2019 of the\nnews. Although the prospective cost\nof Ferguson\u2019s article was Newsweek\u2019s\ndamaged credibility, this was apparently outweighed by its prospective\nbene\ufb01t \u2013 accessing a new market seg-ment. Perhaps they are looking at the\n\ufb02oundering business model of their\nindustry and wondering how to stay\na\ufb02oat in a time of disruptive change.\nNewsweek has to attract and lock-in an audience that wouldn\u2019t dream\nof visiting its website (it will, after\nall, become just a website). Perhaps\nthis move will strain their relationship with the well informed, but \u2013 as\nNewsweek knows \u2013 the well informed\nare a small minority who know how to\naccess their news on the Internet \u2013 for\nfree. Newsweek is going for a volume\nplay. And that naturally entails casting a wider net, which, in turn, entails\ndumbed-down, sexy and incendiary\ncontent. Newsweek is after a new au-dience: one that enjoys the trappings\nof intellectual life but \ufb01nds its sustenance in the broth of entertainment.\nRegarding the debate between Ferguson and Krugman, Ms. Rosenthal\nstates: \u201cI\u2019m not sure there is a clear\ndelineation of what is right and wrong\nhere.\u201d There probably is, but for now\nkeep an eye out for a KardashianKayne cover story.\nline by line. Matthew O Briens piece he is still one the most thought pro Americas Oh Sh t Moment, signal Kayne cover story.\nIn a 2009 panel discussion Ferguson contended that the Obama administration was both Keynesian and monetarist \u2013 an\nincoherent mix (or so we\u2019re told, we\u2019re not really qualified\neconomists over here I\u2019m afraid). Krugman extended his argument to both China and the EU and claimed that Ferguson\u2019s\nview was \u201cresurrecting 75-year old fallacies\u201d and containing\nmany basic errors. Oh and he also called him a \u201cposeur\u201d who\nrelies on \u201csnide comments and surface cleverness to convey the\nimpression of wisdom\u201d. Ouch.\nKrugman 1\u20130 Ferguson.\nPrevious Bouts\n\n"

The criteria are, with the weighting used in brackets: academic reputation (40%\n\u2013 the highest), employer reputation (10%), ratio of staff to students (20%), which is there to assess\nteaching, citations per faculty (20%), amount of international students and staff (10%).\nBrief overview of how the table is compiled\nThefirstthingtonoteisthatthistableisnotthesameastheWorldUniversityRankingsbytheTimesHigher\nEducationSupplement.Thetableiscompiledbytensofthousandsofacademicsbeingcontactedandasked\ntofillouttheTimesHigherEducationAcademicReputationSurvey.ThesurveyusedUnitedNationsdatato\ndistribute it, and was available in nine languages.

The\nman, who was on the phone at the\ntime, asked if the student knew the\narea. The man was described by the\nstudent as middle-aged with white/\ndark hair, is in his 40s, and was well\ndressed. The man reportedly also\nspoke in an American accent and told\nthe student that his car was impounded on Cromwell Road. The student\npointed him in the right direction,\nbut the American man insisted that\nthey take minicab to the car pound,\nand paid the driver \u00a315 upfront. The\nAmerican man regaled the student\nwith information to implicitly suggest\nthat he was to be trusted; one such\npiece of information was that he was\nin the US Marine Corps.\nThe American man then wanted\nthe student to pay for the car to be\nreleased, claiming that his credit card\nwas not working. The student was\npromised that he would receive an\niPod or double the amount of money\nasked. The student said that at this\npoint \u201cI tried to hide my surprise at\nthe rapidly deteriorating situation,\nand said I didn\u2019t want to pro\ufb01t, I just\nwanted to help him.\u201d The student\nwithdrew \u00a370 to\ngive to the man,\nsaying that \u201cby this\nstage... the loss of\n\u00a370 was probably\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nBabar Ahmad has been extradited to\nthe United States after the High Court\nrefused to review his case.

He had\nbeen arrested due to allegations that\nhe was involved in terrorist activity\nthrough a website hosted in America.\nBabar Ahmad\u2019s brother-in-law Fahad Ahmad read a statement on his\nbehalf, in which he said, \u201cToday I have\nlost my 8 year and 2 month battle\nagainst extradition to the US.

    "content": "COMMENT\nAre extradition treaties justified?\nNavid Nabijou\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\nEleanor Angwin\nLast week, Babar Ahmad, a British Muslim who worked at Imperial College, was extradited to the United States to face terrorism charges (see News for full story). So\nare these extradition justified? IC Debating Society weighs up the arguments:\nYES NO\nThe head-to head\nhough they are certainly not per-fect, our current extradition treaties\nare absolutely necessary in order to\ncapture and convict terrorists in\nan increasingly globalised world.\nAgainst any harms brought about by this legisla-tion, this crucial bene\ufb01t must be weighed.\nModern terrorism is a truly global enterprise.\nIts backers have diverse origins and motives, and\nare spread all over the world. Its targets, too, can\nbe found in any country on Earth. The rhetoric\nof terrorist organisations appeals increasingly to\nreligious and political convictions, rather than\nnationalistic ones; a result of this is that the pool\nof potential recruits is indi\ufb00erent to national\nborders, far too dispersed to be explained in the\nsimplistic terms of political geography (as America and its allies discovered, tragically, in Afghanistan). This globalism means, for instance,\nthat an Egyptian man who trained in Pakistan\ncan travel to a European capital and detonate a\nbomb that was assembled in Yemen. And this in-ternationalising trend is continuing relentlessly,\naided by the spread of the World Wide Web and\nthe increasing interconnectedness of modern\nsociety.\nAs such, no terrorist act is con\ufb01ned within a single border. Even the simplest plot depends upon\nthe joint e\ufb00orts of a number of people spread\nacross several di\ufb00erent countries. When someone is implicated in terrorist activity, therefore, it\noften happens that the evidence required to prosecute is only to be found in another country.\nBut therein lies a problem. Law enforcement\nagencies are typically wary of passing evidence\non to other countries (usually citing national security concerns). Now, this is a truly regrettable\nstate of a\ufb00airs, and steps should certainly be taken to encourage greater openness and transparency from these agencies. However, with public\nnervousness already high and governments loath\nto appear soft on security, it seems unlikely that\nthings will change any time soon.\nGiven these restrictions, then, we must be\npragmatic and seek the best possible compro-mise. We \ufb01nd ourselves with three options. One:\nsimply let the suspect walk free. Two: detain the\nsuspect inde\ufb01nitely without charge, arguing that\nthey are too dangerous to be released, but that\nthere is at present insu\ufb03cient evidence to prosecute them. Three: extradite the suspect to the\ncountry in possession of the evidence and allow\nthem to stand trial.\nThe \ufb01rst option \u2013 allowing them to walk\n\u2013 would inevitably result in more deaths. Of\ncourse, not all those accused are guilty, but a signi\ufb01cant proportion of them are: if released, they\nwould almost certainly resume terrorist activity;\nleading to further acts of violence.\nThe second alternative \u2013 detaining the suspect inde\ufb01nitely \u2013 is in many ways even worse.\nScores of innocent people would lose their lib-erty, and many citizens would be left to live in\na state of constant fear, at the mercy of the capricious whims of the police and judiciary. The\nconsequent erosion of public trust would be\ncatastrophic.\nNow consider extradition. The suspect stands\ntrial, in a country whose judicial system a\ufb00ords\nthem all the same rights and protections as our\nown. They have every chance to defend themselves against the allegations. This last point is\nimportant: the suspects are only extradited to\ncountries with strong legal systems, which ensures that they receive a fair trial.\nThe use of extradition is admittedly the result\nof a compromise, but considering the other options available, to reject it is to embrace a host of\nfar more odious measures. For that reason, the\ntreaties are justi\ufb01ed.\nxtraditing criminals is both damaging to overall world justice and an\nexample of snide and sneaky backdoor politics.\nWhen someone commits a\ncrime, there are always victims and there will\nalways be consequences. Whether it is as-sault, where the victim has been physically\nharmed, or theft, where the victim\u2019s livelihood takes the hit, breaking the law always\nleads to someone being emotionally damaged\nby the perpetrator of the criminal act. Decisions based upon emotions that you have felt\ntend to be biased. For example, if someone\nhad killed your brother, you would want them\nto be sent to prison for the maximum amount\nof time, or worse. In your eyes, that would be\nthe only way to ease your pain: knowing that\nthe killer was brought to justice. However,\nthat decision may be a bit harsh, especially if\nthe death of your brother had happened by\naccident. That\u2019s why we have judges and ju-rors, people who are impartial and not emotionally biased towards either the victim or\nthe criminal. We trust in them to make the\nright decision.\nNow think about this on a larger scale.\nWhen 9/11 happened, there were thousands\nof victims who died in that crash, leaving behind grieving families. Not only that, it was a\nmassive attack on the American way of life,\nmeaning that every American felt the pain of\n9/11. When a whole country is left emotionally damaged from a crime, who becomes the\njudge, supposed to hand down impartial sentences proportional to the crime? The President. He, however, can\u2019t be impartial, because\nhe is elected by the people who are feeling the\npain. This means that he has to pander to the\nwants of the public, and so justice becomes\nperverted into the vengeance of the mob.\nSo now we have a whole country of irrational\nactors. Anything even related to 9/11 is an attack on America, but not only that; the allies of\nthat irrational country are bound to supporting their actions. Governments apply pressure\nto the courts, forcing through decisions that\nensure criminals are extradited to the country\nwhere they will face the biggest charge. This\nisn\u2019t justice proportional to the crime; it\u2019s allowing the victims to decide the sentence.\nWhat makes things worse is that the country\na suspect is extradited to depends massively\non that country\u2019s economic and politcal standing in the world. According to the US-UK extradition treaty of 2003, the US can extradite\nUK citizens for offences against US law, even\nthough the offence was committed in the UK\nby a UK citizen. There only needs to be reasonable suspicion that the person committed\nthe crime in order for them to be shipped off\nto America, where they won\u2019t face a free trial\nand will not have access to legal aid from the\nUK. There is no comparable measure for extraditing US citizens to the UK. This glaring\njudicial imbalance is a direct result of the economic imbalance between the two countries.\nAlthough we tend not to extradite criminals\nto countries where they could face the death\npenalty, what if there was \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that a UK citizen breached Uganda\u2019s\nAnti-Homosexuality bill? In this case they\nwouldn\u2019t be extradited, because the UK doesn\u2019t\nreceive as many benefits by allying itself with\nUganda as it does from the US.\nIf extradition continues the way it is, the\nUK government will always be treading on\neggshells, trying to appease whichever superpower is giving them the most money. Justice,\nmy arse.\nE\nT\nTo reject extradition\nis to embrace a host\nof far more odious\nmeasures.\nExtraditing criminals ...\nis an example of snide\nand sneaky backdoor\npolitics.\n\n"

    "content": "From stem cells to sex cells\nStemcellresearchreceivesanothervitalboost.Fiona Hartleyreports\napanese researchers have\ncreated viable eggs in\nmice from skin stem cells\nwhich produced healthy\nfertile o\ufb00spring that successfully had their own progeny. This\nbreakthrough could hopefully lead to\ntreatments for human infertility in the\ndistant future.\nStem cells give rise to all specialised cells in the body, and are also\nself-renewing to produce more stem\ncells. Stem cells in humans come in\ntwo basic forms: embryonic stem\n(ES) cells and adult stem cells. ES\ncells were ethically controversial because of the embryonic destruction\nrequired to harvest them. In 2006,\nShinya Yamanaka succeeded in reprogramming adult stem cells to an ES\ncell-like state. These cells were named\ninduced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.\nYamanaka won the Nobel Prize for\nPhysiology or Medicine for this work\njust this week.\nMitinori Saitou and his team from\nKyoto University, the authors of this\nstudy, have previously made functional sperm cells from adult cells in\nmice, which were used to successfully\nfertilise eggs. Their new study, published in Science last week, shows that\na modi\ufb01ed version of the system they\nused to make sperm can also make\neggs that, importantly, give rise to\nhealthy progeny.\nThe group applied a mix of signalling molecules to turn ES cells and iPS\ncells (derived from skin stem cells)\ninto primordial germ cells (PGCs), the\nprecursor cells to sperm in males and\noocytes (eggs) in females. The PGCs\nwere then added to embryonic ovary\ntissue, making \u201creconstituted\u201d ovaries.\nThis mixture was transplanted into female mice, where immature oocytes\ndeveloped. The immature oocytes\nwere removed, and allowed to mature\nin vitro. The team then fertilised the\nmature oocytes with mouse sperm.\nThe resultant embryos were transplanted into surrogate female moth-ers, and these embryos developed into\nfertile mice.\nSaitou and colleagues are now investigating whether PGCs can be made\nfrom adult human stem cells. This may\nprove di\ufb03cult because of di\ufb00erences\nbetween mouse and human cells, but\nthe ultimate hope is that one day this\ntechnique could be used to make eggs\nto help infertile couples have children.\nScientists have cautioned that a lot of\nwork remains before this goal is remotely achievable though, including\nethical considerations about using human ovary tissue to culture the cells.\nThe immediate impact of the study\nwill be to provide a robust system for\nfurther investigation of mammalian\nfemale germ-line development, the\npoor understanding of which is one\nof the reasons why the research does\nnot yet have any current clinical rel-evance.\nJ\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\n16\nnationalgeographic.com\nThe Battle of Ideas is a weekend long\nfestival of talks and debates hosted by\nthe Institute of Ideas, an independent think tank.

This strand\nof talks will aim to dissect the ethical\nquestions surrounding emerging sci-ences; biotechnology, and embryology\nfor example.

The attitudes of the\npublic and the in\ufb02uence of the media will be examined in this context,\nhighlighting the ever-pressing issue of\ngood and bad practice in science com-munication. Student discounts are\navailable; for more information visit.\nhttp://www.battleofideas.org.uk/\nBattles of Science and Ethics\nJamie-Li RickmanScience Writer\nDeadly snake venom better pain-killer than morphine\nNick Kennedy Science Writer\nFew of us associate the black mamba,\none of the world\u2019s most venomous\nsnakes, with pain relief.\nBut \ufb01ndings recently published in\nNature show that black mamba venom may be a more e\ufb00ective pain-killer\nthan morphine.\nThe black mamba, Dendroaspis pol-ylepis, is feared throughout southern\nand eastern Africa for its extreme\nspeed, length, aggression and lethal\ntoxicity.\nHowever, the French scientists involved found that its venom not only\nserved to abolish pain in mice, but did\nnot cause any side-e\ufb00ects. Morphine,\ncommonly used in anaesthesia to reduce pain, has myriad side-e\ufb00ects, the\nmost dangerous of which is respiratory failure.\nSnake venom can be so deadly because it attacks key ion-pathways\nacross neuronal membranes. We rely\non this transport of ions to communicate vital information around our\nbrain and body. If these pathways are\nprevented from working as normal,\nour entire neuronal super-organism\nbreaks down \u2013 signals cannot be\npassed around the body. But some signals communicate unpleasant sensa-tions, like pain.\nBlack mamba venom contains pain-killing proteins called mambalgins.\nThese mambalgins block the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in the\ncell membrane. ASICs are principal\nplayers in the pain pathway.\nBut a perplexing question remains:\nwhy does venom of such legendary\ntoxicity contain pain-killing proteins?\nThis is a question nobody seems able\nto answer.\nThe black mamba is not the only\nvenomous snake with a potential bene\ufb01t to medicine. There are already\nthree drugs on the market based on\nsnake venom proteins. Epti\ufb01batide\nand tiro\ufb01ban are derived from anticoagulant proteins found in the venom\nof the southeastern pygmy rattlesnake\nand African saw-scaled viper, respec-tively. Both drugs are used to treat\nsu\ufb00erers of angina or heart attacks.\nContortrostatin, a component found\nin copperhead venom, is being used to\nattack breast cancer cells and to prevent cancer from spreading.\nIn fact a plethora of highly toxic animals \u2013 and of course plants \u2013 exhibit\nthis \u2018poison paradox\u2019.\nCone snails are predatory sea snails.\nThey hunt and immobilize prey using\na radular tooth and a poison gland\ncontaining neurotoxins. In 2004 the\nFood and Drug Administration approved the pain-killer Ziconotide, derived from snail cone toxin, for use as\na non-addictive pain-killer substitute\nfor morphine.\nThe venom of the Israeli yellow scorpion contains a protein that binds to\ncancerous cells found in gliomas, a\ntype of brain cancer. When combined\nwith a radioactive solution, this protein can target and destroy glioma\ncells \u2013 and ultimately the cancer. As\nresearch progresses the number of\nthese highly useful animal and plant-derived compounds will only increase\nin number.\nSo it seems there is a charitable \ufb02ip\nside to these venomous creatures that\nare making up for countless lost lives.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature11494\nI\u2019M TIRED OF THESE MOTHERFUCKING SNAKES IN THIS\nMOTHERFUCKING ARTICLE\nnews.wisc.edu\nThe recent successes will help aid\nresearch into germ-line development.\nMeanwhile, the mouse thinks: \u201chmmm,\ndefinitely smells like an arse\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "BUSINESS Business Editor: Deepka Rana\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\n18\nDr. Magdalena Bak-Maier\nProductivity solutions\nDr. Magdalena Bak-Maier responds to students\u2019 queries\nersonally, I do not\nthink that procrastination is entirely\nbad. While we delay\nthe work, we may \ufb01nd\nout a shortcut or a better way to \ufb01nish\nthe work in short time. As Aaron Burr\nwisely said, \u201cNever do today what you\ncan do tomorrow. Something may occur to make you regret your premature\naction.\n\u201d Do I really waste something\nwhile I decided to put o\ufb00 the work?\nCould I be productive as well when I\nam waiting for an idea to come up? \u2013\nGuang Yang, EEE undergraduate.\nProcrastination is not bad in itself.\nIn fact our brains procrastinate for a\nreason: this may be to gather infor-mation, generate ideas or simply because of other priorities. Some people\nappear to be procrastinating because\nthey are not doing any explicit or visible work, and yet, their brain is actually gathering relevant information\nand working things out. If during\nthe \u2018procrastination\u2019 phase ideas are\ncreated, links are made, information\nis gathered however unconsciously,\nresulting in a sense of readiness and\npreparedness and ample time to execute the work, then that\u2019s good. The\nissue here seems to be about using\nprocrastination as a strategy to delay action/decision to avoid doing\nsomething that may turn out to be\nless than ideal. Procrastination where\nnothing is done out of fear of doing\nsomething wrong, is equal to avoid-ance. Such procrastination will leave\nthe person having to face last minute\npressures, work under unnecessary\nstress and often delivers less than\nperfect result. This is not productive.\nMany procrastinators mistakenly believe that they do their best work under pressure of the last minute. More\noften than not, they lack any benchmark around work which they did not\nhave to rush. In my experience, when\nthey try to tackle a project in a more\nplanned way, they are amazed at the\nquality of the results and realise the\npower of e\ufb00ective procrastination.\nOnly by increasing self awareness and\nlearning about oneself can one make\nbest choices when to procrastinate\nand how to do so productively.\nHow di\ufb03cult is it to discern between a\nperson who is just having trouble staying on point, from a person who may\nbe su\ufb00ering a lack of productivity because they have chosen the wrong career for themselves and are unhappy?\nIn the latter case, does your coaching\nstrategy shift from productivity development to career advice? \u2013 Clinton\nCahall, Physics postgraduate.\nTo discern whether one has trouble\nstaying on point because one is not\nmotivated or whether there\u2019s some\nother reason for lack of results one\nhas to be really honest with oneself.\nThis is probably the hardest thing\nto do in my experience and yet also\na sign of true strength. Sometimes\ntalking to a learning professional or\na coach can help, as con\ufb01dence features strongly in this equation. For\nexample, a person lacking con\ufb01dence\nmay self-sabotage without being\naware of this. This is done to ensure\nthat their original thinking that they\ncan\u2019t do it turns out to be right. How\nunfortunate you may think. According to Daniel Pink, author of Drive,\nthere are three characteristics that\nensure motivation, or as Daniel calls\nit, drive. Drive makes people work\nhard for a result. To have drive one\nneeds to have autonomy to make independent decisions (Example: If I\nam studying economics it\u2019s because\nI really want to and not because my\nparents thought it was a good idea),\nbeing able to see/notice one\u2019s skills\nand mastery grow (Exp: As I have a\npassion for the subject, studies become a pleasure because I am really\ninterested in what I discover and learn\nand I become more knowledgeable)\nand having some certainty that the effort contributes to something larger;\na greater purpose (Exp: My studies in\nmaterial design will help create recyclable fabrics that adjust to people\u2019s\nmood and are inexpensive). If you\ncan say yes to all three conditions and\nyet still feel not \u2018on point\u2019, then it is\npossible you may lack speci\ufb01c skills\nor knowledge to help you realise re-sults. I often \ufb01nd that we all lack speci\ufb01c skills and that\u2019s what\u2019s di\ufb03cult to\nface as it requires extra work. Coaching as a developmental intervention\ndoes not give advice. A coach helps\nyou \ufb01nd your own answers by working things out for yourself in a similar\nstyle to the exercises in my book Get\nProductive. Sometimes, our thinking\ncan get very muddled, and decisions\ncan be made for the wrong reasons.\nWe all make mistakes but to persist in\none is silly. Working with a coach or a\nmentor can help unravel the underlying causes for how come something\nis the way it is and help you take action to improve it. So be honest with\nyourself and then talk to other people\nwhose opinion you value and respect\nand get to clarifying your thinking. It\nmay also be worth to explore the other attractors that are making you not\nappear or be \u2018on point\u2019. They may well\nhold the answer to your question.\nP\nCONGRATS!\nClinton Cahall has won a signed\ncopy of Dr. Bak-Maier\u2019s Get\nProductive!\nGood service vs. good marketing\nWhat should you do if you stumble\nupon a great idea for a product with\nhigh demand in a certain market seg-ment? Many \ufb01rst-time entrepreneurs\nhave found themselves in this situation\nbefore, and most of them do not manage\nto turn their idea into a successful busi-ness. While there are many things that\ncan go wrong in the process (within or\nbeyond your control), a very common\nmistake you could make is thinking that\nthe quality of your product will undoubtedly lead you to success. Unfortunately, a\ngood product will not be enough if you\ndon\u2019t have a good business model backing it up.\nAmongst the many people that have\nmadethesamemistakeinthepastisbud-ding entrepreneur Andrew Strube. As he\ndescribes on his website, Andrew moved\ninto a house inundated with stink bugs\nin 2009. He tried to \ufb01nd a solution for it\nbut he couldn\u2019t \ufb01nd any product in the\nmarket that worked e\ufb00ectively against\nthe bugs, so after running out of options\nhedesignedandinventedtheworld\u2019s\ufb01rst\nindoor stink bug light trap. He had come\nup with a good product that worked perfectly and ful\ufb01lled a need that was unsatis\ufb01ed until then. He patented his product\nand started taking orders online, what\ncould go wrong?\nDuring the \ufb01rst two months Andrew\ntook in almost $100,000 in sales. However, sales have been \ufb02at ever since. Even\nthough the start looked promising, his\ncompany did not have a good growing\nbusiness model. As soon as the product\nwas out in the market, corporate competitors developed their own, and they\nhave now taken the entire market share\nwith what is an inferior product, but better delivered. As a lone entrepreneur,\nAndrew had limited ability to compete,\nbut with a solid business model he could\nhave found investors or corporations\nwilling to invest or partner with him.\nThis happens to be a constant for any\nbusiness, and is one of the reasons why\nbranding is so important for a company:\nif your product is not good, you need to\nknow how to sell it; but even if you have\nthe best product in the market, you still\nneed to know how to sell it! We\u2019ll illustrate this with a couple of very clear ex-amples.\nMcDonald\u2019s, Burger King and big corporate fast food chains sell a product of\nvery little quality. In fact, probably most\nof the freshers that have just arrived to\nImperial clueless about how to fry an\negg will be able to produce a better hamburger in a few months\u2019 time than the\none you get with your Big Mac. However,\nI can assure you that they won\u2019t make as\nmuch money if they decide to start selling them. Fast food corporations priori-tise their food making and delivering system over the quality of their product, and\nthat is a business model that has proven\nto be successful for them. It allows them\nto scale up their business fairly easily and\nbuild a strong brand so that the company\ncan grow far beyond the size of small and\nmedium enterprises.\nLet\u2019s now look at Rolex, a company\nwhose aim is to make the best looking,\nmost precise watches in the world. They\nhavebeenproducingthebestwatchesfor\nover a hundred years, but the quality of\ntheir product itself would not have been\nenough to for the company to reach their\ncurrent dimensions. They follow a solid\nbusiness model that has made Rolex\nwatches a status symbol rather than just\nprecise watches. Their branding allows\nthem to sell their product as a luxurious\ngood, obtaining high margin pro\ufb01ts for\nit.\nAs you can see, these are both examples of extremely successful companies,\nand what they have in common is not\nthat they provide a good product or ser-vice, but the fact that they are driven by\na good business model that allows them\nto create a solid brand. That being said,\nwe should not underestimate the importance of delivering a good product, but\nwithout a proper business plan you will\nnot be able to grow your business to its\nfull potential.\nSo let\u2019s go back to the key question:\nWhat should you do if you have a great\nidea you want to turn into a business?\nFirst of all you should identify your market segment (who your potential customers are) and the value you deliver to\nthe customer. That\u2019s what makes your\nproduct good: the fact that it ful\ufb01lls an\nexisting need and the fact that it works\nthewayitshould.Youshouldthinkabout\nhow you will deliver your product: the\nchannels through which your customers\nwant to be reached and the relations you\nwant to develop with your customers.\nThink about the resources you need and\nwhether you can partner up with someone else that can provide them to you. By\nsolving all these issues you are e\ufb00ectively\nelaborating your own business plan.\nFinally, you will have to create a brand\nthat people can identify, and this is the\ntricky bit. There is plenty of material online and on textbooks on how to build\na successful brand, but you will have to\nmake sure that this brand is consistent\nwith your business model. You will want\nto focus on di\ufb00erent areas depending on\nthe strengths and weaknesses of your\nservice, as well as the nature of your target market segment. Finding the appropriate balance between a good product\nand its successful marketing will enable\nyour company to reach its full potential.\nMaximo is a representative of Imperial\nEntrepreneurs.

Many of the\ntouring party still bore visible signs of\nthe night before but everyone made it\nonto the plane with a quick trip to the\nmost expensive Wetherspoons in England for a spot of hair of the dog. Upon\ntouch down in Porto, the \ufb01rst hurdle\nof the tour presented itself. No one on\nthe tour spoke Portuguese so contacting the coach driver that was to take\nus to our hostel proved tricky. Eventually through much running around\nand arm waving, the tour found themselves on a bus into central Porto.\nThe accommodation in Porto was\nunlike any other previous tourers had\nexperienced: clean, friendly and actually like the pictures online.\nThe \ufb01rst full day of tour saw our \ufb01rst\ntwo matches against scratch teams\nfrom Sport Club do Porto and The\nPorto Lawn Tennis and Cricket Club.\nThis was when we found out the true\nmeaning of Portuguese time as our\nopposition arrived a full 2 hours after the scheduled push back. This had\ntwo e\ufb00ects on the party. Firstly, it gave\nthem the chance to sleep o\ufb00 the \ufb01rst\nhangover of tour. Secondly, it exposed\nsome of the fairer skinned hockey players to their \ufb01rst round of lobsterfying,\nBergamasco most notably leading the\ncharge after he fell asleep in the sun.\nRather worryingly, when the opposition did arrive they proudly announced\nthat they had several ex international\nplayers. This did not \ufb01ll us with con\ufb01dence as we were barely able to walk\nlet alone run in our current state. The\ntwo games were hotly contested as the\nheat on the pitch rose to match that\nof the surroundings, with many of the\nPortuguese frustrated with the strictness of the umpiring and the IC players\nfrustrated at the local\u2019s use of their size\nadvantage to try to bully IC o\ufb00 the ball.\nEventually the games ended in a 1-1\ndraw (BT) and a 3-1 loss (2s Captain)\nwith the heat eventually proving too\nmuch for IC to handle.\nThe next day presented the opportunity for a spot of culture as we walked\nthe city on a free tour. If you ask any\nlecturer they will tell you that keeping\n30 students entertained for a hour is\nhard work but our lovely guides kept us\nenthralled for over 3 hours as we took\nin all the culture we could, from J. K.\nRowling to the rather odd sexual exploits of some of Porto\u2019s most famous\nresidents. The tour ended up by the\nriver where we ate the local speciality\nFrancesinha which is sure to clog even\nthe \ufb01ttest arteries with cholesterol.\nAfter lunch a quick pop across the\nriver found us in the heart of Porto\u2019s\nfamous Port district. Despite what\nmany members may have hoped, it is\nthe forti\ufb01ed wine that takes its name\nfrom the City rather than the other\nway around. Taylors was generally\nagreed to be our favourite producer\nand so we paid a visit to their Lodge\nand Wine Cellar where all sorts of\nintelligent questions were asked and\nmany di\ufb00erent ports sampled. Unfortunately no one could quite a\ufb00ord the\nScion which came in at \u00a32500 a bottle\nand we never found out the answer to\nthe question \u201cHow many grapes does\nit take to make a bottle of port?\u201d\nThat evening we found ourselves\nenjoying cocktails served in buckets,\nfor only \u20ac5, by the river side. Measures don\u2019t seem to apply in Portugal\nwith the rather simpler equation of\nhalf a bottle of spirit per drink seeming to be the rule of thumb. This continued into the early hours with those\nhardy souls still awake watching the\nsunrise over Porto from the bridge\nDom Luis, wiith one member of the\ntrip attempting to get intimate with a\nslow moving train.\nA rather sleepy 4-hour coach journey saw us arrive in the capital, Lisbon, which also heralded the return\nof more familiar tour accommodation with the rather less habitable Tagus Homes. Without warning and in\nmuddled English the tour group was\nsplit into two groups with six brave\nsouls being led o\ufb00 to a di\ufb00erent building 500 yards down the road. These\nsix had to put up with the creepy Maria who reminded one and all of a female Sweeney Todd and so the door\nto the dorm remained locked at all\ntimes. The other tour party had the\nmain hostel booked out but with only\n4 toilets between 25 the morning rush\nproved di\ufb03cult at times.\nMore culture was to follow as the\ngroup soon discovered that it generally seemed to be a pretty e\ufb00ective\nhangover cure. However some of the\ngroup was a bit shocked to \ufb01nd that\nSintra is pretty much just one big hill.\nA gruelling walk up to the top most\ncastle was dodged by some as they\nchose to get the bus, which despite\nbeing overprices left many wishing\nthey had forked out.\nThe remaining members of the tour\ndecided to visit the botanical gardens\nand its neighbouring zoo. This resulted in the small child in each resurfacing as they ran from enclosure to enclosure to see, and sometimes attempt\nto imitate, every animal.\nBefore our third match we visited\nthe world famous aquarium in Lisbon,\nthe Ocean\u00e1rio de Lisboa. The darkened corridors proved the perfect\nsurroundings for pre game naps and\nthe \ufb01sh confusing to those who were\nyet to reach the hungover stage.\nOur third game was a men\u2019s match\nvs the Lisbon Casuals at the Olympic\npark. Their name lulled us into a false\nsense of security before we saw their\nhighly professional warm up and a\nquick investigation found that several\nof the opposition played for Portugal\nin their respective age groups. A hard\nfought match ensued with IC eventually going down 3-0 with a stunning\ndefensive e\ufb00ort by all in the sweltering heat. Special mention must go to\nSkid Mark, Trinh-Duc and Fresher\nRob for their performances.\nThe fourth game took place the\nnext day at the same venue against\nthe Lisbon Casuals mixed team. The\nmixed game ended 4-4 (Poore Choice,\nStumpy, 3>2, Brown Love) which re\ufb02ected the evenness and good spirit\nthe match was played in.\nA \ufb01nal long journey deposited us in\nAlbufeira in the heart of the Algarve.\nUnfortunately our match in the south\nwas cancelled at short notice but with\nthe temperature another 4-5 degrees\nhotter than in Lisbon it may have\nbeen a blessing in disguise. Much of\nthe rest of the trip was a bit of a haze\nwith the Strip stripping away all inhibitions and the tourers diving into the\n\u201cculture\u201d and mixing with the diverse\nrange of \u201clocals\u201d.\nThe highlight of Albu\ufb01era had to be\nthe boat trip on our last full day. On\nboard a 40 foot yacht sailing down the\ncoast, lunch on a secluded beach and,\nas ever, glorious sunshine. Many felt\nso relaxed that they decided a spot\nof exercise would do them good and\nchose to swim back to the yacht despite the rather arctic temperature of\nthe water. All but Bergamasco and Token managed the 400 yard swim back\nas they had to be to be rescued by the\nlanding boat that was keeping close\ntabs on \u201cthe crazy English people\u201d.\nIt was a great tour and although we\nreturned home winless it\u2019s the taking\npart that counts.

    "content": "SPORT\n39\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\nIC Rowers take on World U23s in Trakai\nThe Under-23 World Championships\nwere held in Trakai, Lithuania between 11th- 15th July. This year medic\nTim Richards and biochemist Wilf\nKimberley donned the triple hooped\nvests to represent their country and\ndefend Imperial\u2019s honour which they\ndid in style.\nThe road to Trakai was by no means\neasy for Richards, who was rowing\nthe lightweight quad. In spite of injuries to other athletes who may have\nstrengthened the crew, the foursome\nof Tim, Rupert Price (Cambridge\nUni), Kieren Brown (Edinburgh Uni)\nand Alex Robertson (Leander) \ufb01nished a respectable 9th overall in an\nevent where the standard was at an\nall time high. The crew placed a disappointing 5th in a tough opening heat,\nwith last year\u2019s bronze medallists\nSwitzerland only a second in front,\nforcing them in to the repechage. In\nspite of giving their all in the rep, the\nquad missed out on qualifying for the\nA-\ufb01nal by less than three seconds behind the Netherlands. Forced into the\nB-\ufb01nal, the crew battled it out to \ufb01nish just the wrong side of the Brazilians whom they had narrowly beaten\nthe day before in the repechage.\nMeanwhile, Kimberley was put in\nto the lightweight pair, in what was\na previously unthinkable partnership\nwith Matt Bedford from arch-rival\nboat club University of London. However, the two managed to put their\ndi\ufb00erences aside and the partnership\nworked remarkably well with wins at\nMetropolitan Regatta and the Hollandbeker Regatta in Amsterdam, before \ufb01nishing the domestic season at\nHenley with a nail-biting half-length\ndefeat by the Greek U23 heavyweight\npair.\nThe Regatta started strongly for\nthe guys, winning their heat with no\ngreat di\ufb03culty to progress directly to\nthe semi \ufb01nal two days later. Despite\na sub-par race they \ufb01nished second,\nbeing overtaken by the French crew\nwhom they had beaten two days pre-viously, but this still meant progression to the A \ufb01nal. A World Championship \ufb01nal is a rather nerve-racking\nsituation to be in, and it can cause\none to do some rather silly things as\nWilf found out way back in his junior\ndays when, getting into his boat raring\nto go, he completely forgot his oars.\nHowever this time it was his crew-mate in the wrong, and the pair were\nswiftly awarded a yellow card on the\nstart line due to Bedford wearing the\nall-in-one he was meant to change out\nof after weighing in two hours before\nthe race. The pair had a strong race\nbut narrowly missed out on a podium\n\ufb01nish to come in 4th over all after being rowed through in the second half\nof the race.\nWith the new season now well un-derway, the two IC rowers will now\njoin forces for the pair\u2019s head of the\nriver. With a strong intake and several\nreturners for ICBC, it looks like this\nyear\u2019s going be a good one.\nBen Smith Sports Writer\nThis year\u2019s summer weather wasn\u2019t the\ngreatest for polo and for the \ufb01rst time\nin a number of years the weather forecast looked extremely grim when we\nheaded o\ufb00 to Royal Leamington Spa\nfor the Schools and Universities Polo\nNationals. On the upside the Jubilee\nweekend fell perfectly to give us a full\nfour days of play and a chance to get\nthrough even with the looming rain.\nWe pitched our tents at midnight on\nFriday under the headlights of the union minibus and started a few relaxing\ndrinks and cigars as the rain began to\ncome down.\nBleary eyed but awake we got down\nto business, which for the Lower\nIntermediate (LI) teams primarily\nmeant a hair-of-the-dog as we waited\nthrough the two days of lower level\nplay before our matches began. Fortunately, we had a Novice team with\nteam captain Mo and his mixed university team in Novice 1a. We clearly\nhad the best shirts so let the rag tag\nbunch of friends from across the nation sport our red, white and blue as\nwe introduced them to our pony providers Greenpoint for the \ufb01rst time.\nMatching polo pony to rider is not just\na skill it\u2019s an art form, and with two\nunknown players and with only a sentence or two regarding their ability it\nwas anybody\u2019s guess what would suit.\nThough they took to the \ufb01eld with\nmore enthusiasm than I\u2019ve seen in a\nlong time, only Mo looked settled on\nhis pony and the slightly more expressive gait of one of the other ponies left\none player unable to keep his seat and\nhe hit the (fortunately) soft ground\nwith only a muddy patch to show. The\n\ufb01rst match, or chukka, never really got\no\ufb00 the ground for the boys and they\ncame away with a loss and less than\nsparkling whites.\nThe rest of us busied ourselves with\nthe usual drinking, merriment and\noccasionally helping out the organisers until a damp evening came about\nand the polo concluded to give way to\nBBQs, even more drinking and general revelry. A much appreciated gazebo was assembled to keep the worst\nof the weather o\ufb00. It was at this stage\nthat one player admitted to remembering the BBQ, cricket set, minibus,\npolo gear, tent and space blanket\u2026\nbut not his sleeping bag. As such he\nspent his second night shivering under some silver tin foil, beer jacket not\nquite covering the distressingly un-summery conditions.\nWith the novices up to play again\nthe next day things looked set for\nchange. For anyone that hasn\u2019t seen\npolo it\u2019s possibly the fastest, most intense sport out there. For those unbe-lievers; when you\u2019re going 25mph on\nthe back of a ball of muscle \ufb01ve times\nyour size with a 52 inch wooden mallet it\u2019s hard to name something more\nintense. Add to that the other players\ntrying to get their stick in the way of\nyours, and adrenaline isn\u2019t going to\nbe lacking. Periods of play last just 7\nminutes, but that\u2019s more than enough\nto get your blood racing. On their new\nmounts the novices, who were hurtling around at breakneck speed, had\nobviously managed to \ufb01nd their feet a\nbit more and progress was swift, the\nvictories started to come and we began to look forwards to the LI matches\nto come.\nBy this stage though the rain was\nstarting to come down, and the pitches were starting to su\ufb00er. A football or\nrugby pitch gets cut up a bit after a wet\nmatch, but half a dozen or so ponies\ncharging around can really churn up\na wet \ufb01eld so mutterings of cancellations were starting to circulate. Huge\nthanks go to O\ufb00church Bury polo\nclub for letting us carry on, in the polo\nworld your \ufb01elds are your livelihood\nand they took a huge risk and a great\nexpense in order to let us carry on.\nThe slippery grass took its toll on one\nmember of the team that afternoon;\nwith Jon tearing a ligament before\neven getting on a horse as he was running to judge a tiebreak while working\nfor the organiser.\nThis sent us scurrying to \ufb01nd a substitute for our LI team, not only that\nbut it needed to be someone our pony\nprovider knew and could mount.\nEventually a suitable alternative was\ndiscovered in the form of Nick, even\nif he was a Cambridge student. Donating him an ICU shirt that instantly\nmade him look better; we mounted\nup and yelled a few frantic words at\neach other before the carnage com-menced. The big pitch for the higher\nlevel matches had seen relatively light\nplay so far and despite a fair number\nof dodgy bounces and a warning to\nbe careful about turning too fast to\navoid slipping, the pace of the matches\nquickly got up. Communication was\nan issue to begin with and between\ntrying to \ufb01nd a shape as a team and\ngetting to grips with the ground and\nthe ponies, we unfortunately didn\u2019t\nfare too well and lost.\nThe last, rival IC team fared better\nwith their \ufb01rst two matches coming in\nas victories and putting them into the\ntwo chukka \ufb01nal. We struggled our\nway to a frustrating defeat as the team\n\ufb01nally started to coalesce into a functioning unit. The tide of the match\nturned just too late for us to capitalise\nand secure a victory, leaving us \ufb01ghting to avoid the wooden spoon. Meanwhile the novice pitch was forced into\nswitching to the larger in\ufb02atable arena\npolo balls as the pitch had become a\nquagmire and the small hard ball traditionally used for grass polo simply\nsunk into the mud on every hit. This\nwasn\u2019t slowing the novice team down\nthough and their big hits looked fan-tastic.\nIt wasn\u2019t all fun and games though;\nthe odious duty of partying the night\naway was left. Many of the \ufb01nal day\nmatches are decided upon which team\ndoes better at avoiding the hangover,\nor very occasionally, on who ends up\nwith least company. Fortunately, no\none that was to be riding in the morning misbehaved too much and after\nmerrily toasting the Jubilee we were\nall just about safe to get on horses in\nthe morning. A goal from a penalty hit\nat 60 yards was still not quite enough\nto save us from the dreaded wooden\nspoon, though the Novices \ufb01nished\ntheir weekend strong. The \ufb01nal Imperial team fought a close \ufb01nal where at\nthe end of the \ufb01rst half things didn\u2019t\nlook great, but grit and determination\nset in and they pulled ahead in the dying stages to take the victory.\nWith the winter season just begin-ning, our training for the February\nwinter nationals has had a little head\nstart with the wet weather and a few\nof us are raring to get back in the saddle now. As such there is an exhibition\nmatch to top o\ufb00 the summer season\non October 20th alongside the Beginner taster session. If you think you\u2019d\nlike to try one of the fastest, most\nexciting sports around why not come\nalong and have a go\u2026 and get a bit of a\nshow thrown into the bargain!\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nSorcha Cotter, Margot Pikovsky\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIC Polo \u201cwets\u201d appetite\nAlex Savell Riding and Polo chair\nImage courtesy of edphillipsimages.com\n\n"

A period of consultation is now expected to begin. Beaumont said that he was going to be talking to people about it and explaining\nthe changes.\nIt is expected that the \ufb01nal docu-ment, with any changes made to the\ncurrent one available, will be made\npublic twelve days before Council\nmeets to vote on it.\nLast year, the Union President at the\ntime, Scott Heath, proposed changes\nto the Consitution, which is e\ufb00ectively\nthe set of guidelines that decides how\nthe Union is structured and governed.\nThe changes proposed this time\naround are di\ufb00erent do not include\nthe Deputy President (Finance & Services) no longer being a position.\nThe Representation & Welfare\nBoard (RWB) would be split into two\nin the changes. These would be the\nEducation & Representation Board,\nwhere o\ufb03cers who are dealing with\nrepresentation would sit, and the\nCommunities & Welfare Board, where\nwelfare o\ufb03cers would sit.\nThe composition of Executive Committee has also been proposed to\nbe changed. This would include the\nPresident as the Chair (as before), the\nDeputy Presidents, the Constituent\nUnion Presidents, and four members\nof Council; this would be instead of\nthe members of the CSB and FWB.\nThe Executive Committee, which currently deals with the day-to-day running of the Union and not the policy\ndirection, would remain in that role.\nIt would, however, be able to approve\nexpenditure of up to \u00a3100,000 and not\n\u00a3500,000 as before. This was justi\ufb01ed\nwith the reason being that only one or\ntwo events ever get to that much.\nIn the new Constitution, Court will\nno longer exist with its roles shifted to\nsub-committee of the Trustee Board.\nThe changes propose that the Trustee Board is changed in makeup. The\nnew Board would be the President,\nCouncil Chair, all of the Deputy Presidents (Education, Welfare, Finance &\nServices, and Clubs & Societies), and\ntwo elected Student Trustees.

We will never\nabandon our struggle for justice and\nthe truth will eventually emerge of\nwhat will be forever remembered as\na shameful chapter in the history of\nBritain\u201d.\nShadow Justice Minister, and Tooting MP, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cThe way\ncriminal cases work in America\nmeans that defendants facing a trial\nare advised to plea bargain. It is a big\nrisk pleading \u2018Not Guilty\u2019. My understanding is that the consequences of\nthis include the threat of life in solitary\ncon\ufb01nement without parole, should\nthey lose a trial. If those are the stakes\nwhich pleading \u2018Not Guilty\u2019 involve\nthen it is no wonder that over 97 per\ncent of defendants accept a plea bargain \u2013 regardless of how con\ufb01dent or\ndetermined they are to stand trial\u201d\nA British Businessman and anti-extradition campaigner Karl Watkin\ntried to call for a private prosecution\nin the UK. The Director of Public\nProsecutions (DPP), Kier Starmer QC,\nrejected his proposal. Mr Starmer released a statement that said Mr Watkin\u2019s documents were \u201cvery short, lack\nany meaningful detail and do not provide any real support for a prosecution\u201d.\nMr Watkins responded stating,\n\u201cThe public will decry this decision\nas it supports a trial thousands of\nmiles from where the alleged crime\nwas committed simply because in the\nDPP\u2019s opinion, the evidence is too\nweak to prosecute in the UK. If that\u2019s\nnot outsourcing our criminal justice\nsystem, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\nAhmad will now face trial in the United States\nstage... the loss of \u00a370 was probably\nthe best outcome I could hope for\u201d.\nThe student informed the driver of\nthe minicab asking to not be left with\nthe con man.\nHaving left the student in the mini-cab with all of his belongings, the\ncon man returned to say that he now\nrequired \u00a3200. The student avoided\nwithdrawing this money by telling\nthe con man that he had reached his\noverdraft limit. The American man\nthen attempted to take the mini cab\nto a \u201crelative\u2019s house\u201d, but the driver\ndid not take him. The driver then left,\nand the student told the con man\nthat he could not help any more. The\ndriver then picked the student up\nfurther down the road and took the\nstudent to Kensington police station.\nIn the police station, the crime\ntook 4 hours to report.\nThe crime has also been reported\nto the Imperial College Police O\ufb03cer\nand the Imperial College Head of Security.\nThe student said: \u201cI was lucky to\nlose only \u00a370. Had it not been for the\ndecency of the cab driver, it may have\nended up much worse\u201d.\n... continued from the front page\nStudent asked for \u00a3200\nBUCS changes could affect sports teams\nChanges to the league that Imperial College London\u2019s sports teams play in could\nrequire some reorganisation.\nThe teams are currently split into ImperialCollege(whichisallofthesubjects\nfrom the university) and Medics (which,\nas hinted in the name, is Medicine).\nHowever, it was brought up in Council\non Monday 8 October by the President\nof the Imperial College School of Medicine Students\u2019 Union President, Shiv\nVorha, that the league is going to force\nImperial to change. This change could\nmean that teams will lose positions in\nleagues, or be put into di\ufb00erent leagues.\nIt was decided at Council that it would\nbe more pertinent for the sports teams\nto discuss the issue.\nwould all be appointed. They would\nbe the Lay Trustees, College Governor, Life Member, and two appointed\nStudent Trustees. The Student Trustees would be appointed by being put\nforward by the Appointments and Remunerations Committee, rati\ufb01ed by\nCouncil, and approved by the Trustee\nBoard. Any Trustee could be removed\nby a 2/3rd vote of Council.\nThe Trustee Board would no longer\nhave 4 Student Trustees voted by the\nentire student body, and the Court\nChair would no longer have a place.\nAnother change is that the RSM\nwould become a Constituent Union,\nalong with all of the other current Faculty Unions (RCSU, CGCU ICSMSU).\nIn Council, this point did cause some\ncontention about how it would e\ufb00ect\nrepresentation.\nThe position of a Sabbatical O\ufb03cer\nfor Postgraduates is put forward as\nwell. The paper says that Beaumont\u2019s\nopinion is that the Graduate Schools\nAssociation (GSA) President being\nthe Sabbatical O\ufb03cer would work\nbest. Also the Faculty Unions (e.g.\nRCSU) would no longer be representing Postgraduates, with the GSA taking that role.\nA change proposed in elections was\nthat the Returning O\ufb03cer would be an\nexternal person.\nPaul Beaumont will be writing a Comment article for next week\u2019s Felix to explain the changes.

She reluctantly goes,\nnaturally assuming that the service she\nneeds to provide would be sexual in na-ture. Turns out the old gentleman has\nvery little interest in actually sleeping\nwith her. What follows is a dull, plodding\nseries of conversations between the two,\ncovering a range of topics that are clearly\nsupposed to have some sort of a deeper\nmeaning. The two brilliant actors are given plenty of room to breathe, as director\nAbbas Kiarostami has no problem standing back and letting the leads do all the\ntalking, but the criminally abrupt ending that provides absolutely no sense of\nclosure will surely leave everyone dumb-struck without fail.\nCrazy Eyes\nThere is nothing wrong with exploring\nthe dark and twisted sides of wealth,\nwomen and alcoholism, but when handled distastefully, as it is with Adam\nSherman\u2019s latest feature, it can turn\ninto nasty, unpleasant viewing. A rich\nyoung man (Lukas Haas) with a long list\nof problems turns to heavy drinking for\ncomfort and solace. He has a string of\neccentric lovers but the one he is truly\ninterested in doesn\u2019t return his feelings.\nHis obsession is creepy, her money-grabbing, quirky behaviour is frustrat-ing, and the \ufb01lm fails to truly hone in\non either of their true nature. Lacking\na single character worth giving a damn\nabout and bombarded with meaning-less, pretentious narration, there are\nfar too few redeeming factors on offer\nhere.\nGrassroots\nTwo jobless best friends decide to take\non the supposedly corrupt incumbent\ncouncil member in Seattle. Their method\nis to heavily campaign the use of the\ncity\u2019s electric monorail for a cleaner, less\ngrid-locked neighbourhood. That strat-egy, along with the running man\u2019s genu-ine, earnest albeit quirky desire to improve the area does gain a lot of support.\nFor the campaign manager (American\nPie\u2019s Jason Biggs), who started this with\na half-hearted belief, it becomes an important project that could really become\nsomething legitimate. The \ufb01lm is simple,\nlight on details and the brisk pacing does\nnot help with the \ufb01lm\u2019s political aspects\nwanting to be taken more seriously, but\nthe ensemble of various talents does\nbring out the occasional outrageous\nlaughs.\nAntiviral\nIn a distant future where celebrity culture has grown wildly out of control,\nmembers of the public pay to receive\ninjections of diseases that were once\ncarried by the big shot superstars them-selves. It\u2019s an odd concept difficult to\nfully accept, which is a part of the reason\nwhy this social satire never fully works.\nDespite a strong, unsettling performance from Caleb Landry Jones, as one\nof the employees of a mass pharmaceutical \ufb01rm that provides such eccentric services who purposefully acquires the latest \u201cdisease\u201d only to discover its deadly\nconsequences, there always exists that\nfeeling of disbelief that undermines the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s narrative drive. Still, the ideas behind the story, as well as its reflection on\nmodern day\u2019s \ufb01xation on fame provide\nsome food for thought for the audience.\nIn the House (Dans la Maison)\nFrench director Francois Ozon\u2019s latest\noffering is a warm blend of intriguing\ndrama as well as downright hysterical\ncomedy that handsomely unveils the\nmany hidden layers in his characters and\nplot points with his controlled pace. A\nfrustrated high-school literature teacher\n\ufb01nally \ufb01nds a young student who shows\ntalent in the subject. The only hiccup is,\nall the boy wants to write about is his obsession with his friend\u2019s mother. It\u2019s fas-cinating, disturbing, amusing all in one\nbig swoop, which is why he lets his pupil\ncarry on with this task. But as time goes\nby the situation gets slightly out of hand,\nand the two \ufb01nd themselves in precarious positions. Sounds dead serious, but\noften it\u2019s not, which is one of the \ufb01lm\u2019s\ngreatest strengths.\n\n"

In what\ncan only be described as probably\nthe most eventful lunchtime of the\nterm so far, Imperial played host to\nthe inaugural Imperial College London Rock Paper Scissors Championship (or RPS, as it\u2019s called by almost\nnobody). Felix brings you an on the\nground report of the lunchtime\u2019s\nevents.\nStudents and sta\ufb00 from all departments assembled beneath the Queen\u2019s\nTower to participate in the momentous event. The Imperial College London Rock Paper Scissors Championship was o\ufb03cially declared open by\nDenis Wright, Dean of Students, and\nJane Neary, Director of Commercial\nServices, as they gave participants an\nexemplary demonstration of how to\nplay the game.\nAfter an energetic warm-up, participants battled against each other val-iantly, showing impressive dedication\nand commitment to the sport. Brutally, however, \ufb01fty percent of players\nwere wiped out of the competition\nwith each round, whilst the remaining\ncontestants progressed up the \u2018steps\nof glory\u2019 towards the Queen\u2019s Tower.\nAfter just four rounds, the Ladies\u2019\nImperial College London Rock Paper\nScissors Champion, Sonali Campion\nof Imperial Hub, and Men\u2019s Imperial\nCollege London Rock Paper Scissors\nChampion, Alan Soltani from the\nPhysics department, emerged from\nthe participants. Sonali and Alan then\nwent head-to-head in a battle to become the \ufb01rst ever Imperial College\nLondon Rock Paper Scissors Champion of Champions.\nIn a tense \ufb01nal, the skill level was\nupped to \u2018expert\u2019 level \u2013 the winner\nwas crowned after not the best-of-one, not the best-of-three, but the\nbest-of-FIVE matches of Rock Paper\nScissors\u2019. Sonali and Alan took their\nstance on the third step up.\nMatch one. A point to Alan! The\ncrowd cheers! (Well, one of Alan\u2019s\nfriends cheers.) The next match yields\na draw. And the next, another draw.\nAnd then... SONALLIIIII! The Imperial Hub cohort goes wild and chant\n\u201cSo-na-li, So-na-li!\u201d.\nSilence descends across the crowd\nin preparation for match number \ufb01ve.\nAlan just clinches it and takes us into\na nail biting sixth match. Draw. The\ntension is prolonged and the handful\nof remaining spectators still watching\nfell silent. Another draw. (OK, when\nwill this end?) And then, out of no-where, match nine... goes to... ALAN!\nHe is triumphant! He basks in the\nglory! Alan Soltani from the Physics\ndepartment is the \ufb01rst ever Imperial\nCollege London Rock Paper Scissors\nChampion! The Imperial Hub team\nrush to comfort Sonali, who seemed\nsurprisingly unemotional.\nFelix managed to get an exclusive\ninterview with Alan just after he\u2019d\nreceived his new title. We asked him\nhow it felt to be the \ufb01rst Imperial\nCollege London Rock Paper Scissors\nChampion. Elated and slightly overwhelmed he said: \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing\nfeeling. The \ufb01nal was really tense and\nfor a minute I thought I\u2019d lost. But\nI pulled through after some great\ncoaching and with mental strength.\u201d\nAs a friend called to him telling him\nthey were late for their next lecture\n(or something like that) he was heard\nsaying \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you now, I\u2019m a\nceleb.\u201d\nWe later spoke to Sonali who told us\n\u201cI\u2019m still in shock! It started o\ufb00 fairly\nrelaxed but as I climbed the steps it\ngot more and more intense.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cI was disappointed to\nmiss out on the overall title... but Alan\nwas a worthy winner.\u201d\nBoth Sonali and Alan have secured\ntheir place in the National Rock Paper\nScissors Championship this Saturday.\nSonali has been swatting up on tips\nand also practicing with friends in the\nhope that this time she might claim\nthe top prize. Encouragingly, she is\nyet to be beaten by anyone except her\nboyfriend. (Awkward?)\nThe event really was a great success\nand Sport Imperial should be thanked\nfor arranging the tournament. Neil\nMosley, Head of Sport Imperial, told\nus: \u201cSport Imperial has always been\ndevoted to enhance students and sta\ufb00\nexperience at Imperial. We hope this\nevent gives people, especially new\nstudents, a di\ufb00erent way to meet new\npeople. This is our \ufb01rst Imperial Rock\nPaper Scissors Championship and,\ngiven everyone\u2019s involvement and\nresponse today, we think it could become a new tradition at Imperial!\u201d Felix couldn\u2019t agree more, and we can\u2019t\nwait for the return of the Imperial\nCollege London Rock Paper Scissors\nChampionship next year.\n(Oh, and in case you were wondering (which you probably weren\u2019t), I\ncame last after losing four consecutive times, which is actually just as\nprobable as winning four times in a\nrow. Therefore technically I am a winner too, right?

    "content": "Bestival: It\u2019s in the name\nMonday morning at Bestival provided\none of those typically British end-of-summermoments.As50,000hung-over\nfestival goers packed up, or, in many cas-es, abandoned, their tents and gazebos,\na distinct air of conclusion could be felt\nin the rainy skies of Robin Hill Country\nPark on the Isle of Wight. The preceding\nfour days could not have been in starker\ncontrast, with intense sunshine ensuring unfortunate burns and tan lines all\nround, accompanying a barmy weekend\nof wide-ranged music and comedy.\nNot many people will argue with me\nwhen I say that there were some extraordinary performances at Bestival this\nyear, not least from the 62-year-old soul\nlegend Stevie Wonder, who produced\nsuch a hit-packed two hour set that it\nleft many in a daze, including covers of\nJohn Lennon\u2019s \u2018Imagine\u2019 and the Beatles\u2019\n\u2018She Loves You\u2019\n. This was, in fact, a trend\nat Bestival this year as the older generation of performers generated the loudest cheers, with the exception of Gary\nNuman, who decided the crowd would\nprefer to hear him reel o\ufb00 his new brand\nof heavy metal at the expense of his clas-sics. Saturday\u2019s headliners New Order,\nwith 56 year old Bernard Sumner at the\nhelm, captured the imagination with an\nimmaculate delivery of their hits, combined with several Joy Division songs\nincluding the show-stopping \u2018Love Will\nTear Us Apart\u2019\n, played to a backdrop of\nIan Curtis with the words \u201cforever Joy\nDivision\u201d displayed across the screen.\nSister Sledge (of \u2018We Are Family\u2019 fame)\nand ever-present funk group Earth\nWind & Fire also raised the proverbial\nroof despite a sizeable age gap with the\nBestival audience. That is not to say that\nthe current generation of indie bands\ndelivered lacklustre performances. Two\nDoor Cinema Club were as good a\nwarmupforNewOrderasanyonecould\nhave hoped for, working the main stage\ncrowd into a frenzy with a combination\nof new songs from recently released\nalbum Beacon, and well-known crowd\npleasers from Tourist History. Friendly\nFires also proved to be a massive hit\nlate on Sunday evening for those brave\nenough to stand through lead singer Ed\nMacfarlane\u2019s ridiculous dancing, as they\nraced through their unique brand of in-dietronica. Bestival organisers however\ndid not prove to be the most popular of\n\ufb01gures on Friday evening as an awkward\nclash between post-punk band, The\nHorrors, and minimalist three-piece,\nthe XX, presented itself to the Bestival crowd. The contrast between these\ntwo performances could not have been\ngreater, as the main stage crowd were\nrewarded with the XX\u2019s only UK festival performance this summer, sending\nshivers down the spine of those watch-ing. The Horrors however, blitzed their\nway through a 45 minute set, under a\ncloud of smoke created by their overly-exuberant spli\ufb00-smoking fans. Friday\nevening had already provided us with a\nclash between Mercury hopefuls Alt-J\nand psychedelic quartet Django Django. Alt-J, spurred on by an expectant\ncrowd, overcame early nerves to show\nexactly why their album, An Awesome\nWave, reached a peak position of 19 in\nthe charts earlier this year. Friday night,\nhowever, was dominated by one woman\nand her band; Florence Welch owned\nthe night with her humongous stage\npresence and extraordinary voice. From\nwhat I recall, she did not miss a single\nnote, even on her recent number one\n\u2018Spectrum\u2019 which the crowd tried (and\nfailed) to sing along to.\nAlthough wildlife was the o\ufb03cial\ntheme of Bestival 2012 (and impeccably\nobserved by the majority), curator Rob\nDa Bank had clearly placed an emphasis on dance and electronic music in his\nlineup to go with the usual indie and\nrock acts. Friday evening in the Big Top\nwas a prime example of this, as a rousing\nDJ set from Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe was\nfollowed by London DJ SBTRKT and\nconcluded by Belgian duo 2manydjs, by\nwhich time the crowd had been pounded from all sides by irrepressible bass\nfor 3 hours. Saturday evening followed\na similar trend as a rousing rendition\nof \u2018Pon De Floor\u2019 by Major Lazer was\nfollowed by many peoples\u2019 highlight of\nthe weekend, as Justice taught a lesson\nin how to work a crowd into an absolute\nfrenzy, accompanied by a quite incredible stage setup and lighting. By the time\nthey reached their encore, the crowd\nwas so large many stood outside the tent\nto catch a glance of the duo.\nI like to think of Bestival as a quirky\nfestival. It likes to do things a bit di\ufb00erently to other festivals, as shown by the\nannual fancy dress theme. You\u2019re surrounded by people who have a common passion for a certain kind of music\n(not always the case at R&L). The one\nthing Reading does have in its favour,\nhowever, is location- who ever thought\nit would be a good idea to host a festival on an island? I would recommend\nBestival to anyone who goes to a festival\nfor the music and is not put o\ufb00 by the\nqueues.\nThis photo makes me hate the fact\nit is not summer anymore...\nAlex Hooftman\nMUSIC\nFrench Radio: Pourqoui pas?\nIt seems as though the older you get,\nthe less time there is for doing fun\nthings, like having sex or keeping up\nwith the best new music. (Or maybe\nthat\u2019s just because you have a frigid\nboyfriend from Imperial and you \ufb01nally have better things to do with\nyour time than read the slightly ridiculous and shit NME). Although the\ngetting-more-sex issue hasn\u2019t been\nresolved, a great solution to the latter\nis the Laura Leishman Project, a show\non French radio station Le Mouv.\n\u201cLe French music? Le merde!\u201d I\nhear you cry. Much of the time this\nis the case. Many students studying\nFrench and trying to improve aural\nskills will come across the inability to\n\ufb01nd a good French radio show which\nplays good music. There probably are\nvery few others apart from LPP which\nticks both these boxes.\nHosted by the lively Laura Leishman, she does a right job of engaging\nthe listener and making them passionate about the music she plays.\nEven her voice is a pleasure to listen\nto. Being of Swiss origin and \ufb02uent\nin English, the e\ufb00ect on her accent\nmakes it easier to connect to her as\na DJ, rather than feeling distanced by\nthe posh tones of a typical Frenchfrom-France accent.\nFor those who don\u2019t speak French,\nthe playlists in themselves are usually\nworth tuning in for \u2013 that is for fans\nof electronic music and hip hop (both\nAnglophonic and Francophonic). Being French, obviously the station has\nthe best access to artists from the\nFrench electro scene, who feature\nstrongly in the tracklists. Longer exclusive mixes are also a bonus and\ncan usually be easily found on internet searches.\nFor French speakers, regular interviews are a chance to get a good\ninsight into French musicians when\nEnglish interviews may restrict their\nexpression. English-speaking artists\nare interviewed and have their responses translated. Reviews on new\nmusic by guests are also featured,\nsimilar to the format on British radio shows and public interaction is\nsometimes encouraged through the\nmedium of suggesting songs for silly\nthemes at the end of the night. Despite this, the best part of the show\nis its lack of gimmicks and cringey\nphone-ins from listeners.\nIf all this takes your fancy, and your\nImperial man is still not being man\nenough for your evenings, you can\nlisten to LLP live between 9pm and\n11pm Monday-Friday by streaming\nfrom Le Mouv website or re-listen at\nanytime.\nLily Le\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter,\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n25\nFRIDAY 12 OCTOBER\nAMS\u2019 album of the week\nTameImpalareleasedtheirdebutalbum,Innerspeaker, in 2010. A 60s throwback made of fuzzy guitar and\nbig psychedelic hooks, it was filled with catchy pop\nsongs and hum-along melodies. Their new album is a\nmuchmorecomplicatedaffair.Lonerismistheclassic\nsophomore album. It\u2019s a band maturing, diversifying,\nexperimenting, but ultimately, running out of hits.\nThere is definitely a lot to like here. The opener Be\nAboveItisareallyniceintro,withspokenwordhiddenunderwavesoffuzz.There\u2019s\na really nice bass line carrying the track along in Apocalypse Dreams and there\u2019s a\ngreat synth part in it as well. In fact, the whole song is great until around 3 minutes\nwhen it goes a bit Pink Floyd. Why Won\u2019t They Talk To Me is probably my favourite\nonthealbum.Thedynamicchangesfeelnaturalandthebubblingsynthintheback-ground is really pretty. Feels Like We Only Go Backwards is lovely too. The laughter\nin the background of Keep on Lying is a personal highlight, it\u2019s a shame about the\nending to the song. The last track is an absolute treat as well; a Tame Impala song I\ncan\u2019t think of a lazy 60s comparison for. A piano and vocal affair followed by over 2\nminutes of flange effects. It might not be that much of a treat.\nThe problem with the album is that it consistently overruns. The intro is great,\nbut it should be just that, an intro, not a full length song. Long songs need to go\nsomewhere and that doesn\u2019t seem to be something Tame Impala excel at. There\nare several 5 or 6 minute tracks here and they all either go nowhere and become\nreally dull (Music To Walk Home By and Keep on Lying) or go somewhere that reallydoesn\u2019twork(ApocalypseDreamsandNothingThatHasHappened\u2026).SheJust\nWon\u2019t Believe Me is really shit as well. It sounds like a proper song and then just\nstops. I don\u2019t see the point, it doesn\u2019t sound good, it\u2019s not clever. It\u2019s trying too hard\nat it\u2019s most bizarre.\nThis album is not bad, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly good either. Instead, I\u2019m\ngoingtopatronisinglycallit\u201cpromising\u201d.There\u2019senoughherethatIthinktheyhave\na great album in them, it\u2019s just not quite there yet.\nTame Impala - Lonerism\nMusic Writer\nMusic Writer\n\n"

After many panicked calls, I\nhopped on the next \ufb02ight, having\nspent the day getting to know Gatwick.

All I can say is: at\nthe interview, be passionate and knowledgeable about your employer and your\nemployment. It will sell a portion of your case for you.\nMy experience in Norwich at The Sainsbury Laboratory has been eye-open-ing, educational, and enjoyable. Thus far I have spent 8 months developing my\nown project looking into expression of the protein receptor FLS2 and its function in the plant immune response. While the learning curve was steep initially \u2013\nwhat you actually do in practice is far different from the theory you get taught \u2013\nit allows you to better appreciate what goes into the discoveries that you study.\nI have further been introduced to the way science is truly global, arguably a\ndouble edged sword. Brilliant because you can meet and interact with people\nthat you would never meet otherwise, but there is also the moving from place\nto place regularly, meaning you will have to start the process of making friends\nrepeatedly; not an easy challenge for some.\nYou can, of course, find different methods of keeping your mind preoccupied\n\u2013 sports for example are a valuable outlet that allow you to relax after a long\nday.
