They say that we ignore\nthe arts, religion and the humanities. Dr. Ju lian Huxley wrote an article in the \"Daily Mail\"\nclaiming that Christian beliefs are no longer\ntenable and that the time has come for a new\nreligion, worshiping fact. In this, the leading\nCollege, an examination of out Social Clubs,\nGeneral Studies and Touchstone should allay the\nthe doubts of the journalists. As for Dr.Huxley,\nthe more T'% ni. the field of Science and\nTechno1\no gy che more I marvel a; the Wondrous\nV'i ko of God. Some people attribute these wonders to \"natural evolution\" - Who planned the\nevolution ? If a survey were carried out, I wager that the general public would be surprised\nto find that Science and Technology is a comparative stronghold of Christianity. Let us not\nbe complacent, however, there is room for considerable strengthening.\nThe plans for the future of National Service,\nannounced by Mr.Macleod during the Easter Vacation, will have caused some despondency amongst\nI.C. man who had hoped for a system of selective\nrecruitment which would exempt holders of Ithe\ndegrees they hope to obtain. Whilst the plans\nani ounce d are undoubtedly fair, in that those\nwho came straight to University from school\nshould not gain an advantage over those who did\ntheir National Service first, they seem to have\npolitical rather than practical expediency.\nAfter spending a large sum of money training\na scientist or engineer, is it not foolish\nto spend as much again giving him military\ntraining ? After National Service his job\nwould exempt him from conscription during a war, or he would be abroad anyway. Of course,\npractically 100 $ of the World's population\ndoes not want a war. If only they had control\nover their leaders I An agitation of the undergraduate population\nof the three Colleges, akin to gaseous molecular\nexcitement (the analogy is chosen advisedly! ),\nreminds us of the approach of the Summer Examinations. Sales of 'bus tickets to Harlington,\n'Hop' tickets, refectory lunches, and \"Felix\"\nwill\"'drop; those of coffee, cigarettes, aspirin\nand textbooks will rise. This usually happens\nand any doctor will tell you that it is just\nthe reverse of what should happen to increase\nthe average amount of examination success.\n*SPEK\"} A NIGHT IN THE COUNTRY*\nAT\n(near Vtf^m 'va\nFr tfa j r1aj11^)\\ Q OObuKtt^OOa.m.Bar YM 2-OOai*- 8a xx J Hfc 5-OOa.m.& \u00bb(fc.r included.) CcScVies{<um. Union QdJESpw\ndecision. This was borne out\nby the reception with which the announcement was\nreceived at the preceding Union General Meeting.\nIt was announced that about 70 students,\nwould now be accommodated in the Concert Hall for\nthe Queen Mother's visit, instead of the previously announced number of 35. Invitations\nhave now been sent out - mainly to officials\nof clubs and officers of the Union.\nA lengthy discussion took place on whether\na grand or an upright piano should be purchased.\nOne Council member said that he was at a mining\ncamp in Canada where they had both a grand and\nan upright; he said that the treatment which\nthe pianos had received at the ca^ap was probably\nsimilar to that likely to be received at I.C., and then went on to discuss how each piano stood\nup to its rough handling. A decision was postponed until further investigation had taken\nplace.\nThe much-discussed question of the furniture\nin the Union Lounge was raised, and it was declared that the present furniture \u00bb<s to be distributed to various points in the Union and that\nsolid, durable furniture was to be purchased -the Union is responsible for its upkeep^\nThe words\"Ladies\" and \"Gentlemen\" were to\nbe put on appropriate doors, as, in the past,\nabsence of these had led to unfortunate incidents.\nAT. Y. set is to be hired by the Union.\nAlso a second billiard table is to be purchased.\nThe Entertainments' Committee expressed concern at the way Club Hops were being run -they had been instituted originally with the\nintention of providing hops of a higher standard than the ordinary ones and of lessening\nthe burden of the Entertainments' Committee,\nbut neither pi these aims were being fulfilled; many club of r xc i als approached them the day\nbefore, wit i the result that in the end, it was the Committee who organised the hop.\nNo definite decision was taken.\nIt was agreed that U.L. U. Clubs should\nnot, in future, be allowed to hold dinners\nin the Dining Ball, as the demand by College\nClubs and Societies was so great.\nThe undoubted Highlight of the meeting, was\nwhen a police officer called to see Mr. Kitchener;\nthis is reported in kel sons Solum this issue.\nCHOIR CONCERT\nI.C. Choir scored at. undoubted success\nwith the i \u00a3 Spring concert performed before a packed af^ie nce4.A. last term. The first\nfc \\lf Of .v^e cono ert was made up of short\nworks, deg in r_j^ with the overture \"Alcina\" by\nHandel and \"i yr a's Fantasia No. 2. The choirs\nsinging of \"Hosanna to the Son of David\" by\nWeelmes, \"Christus Pactue est pro l. obis\"by\nAneria.ar.d Purcell's \"Jenova quam Multe sunt\nEostes Mei\" made *t clear the choir had worked\nhard and improve^ greatly. Balance ar.dex or ee \u2014\nsion were particularly good. Rhianon James arid\nKenneth Sandford then sang two arias by Mozart.\nAfter tK ft interval was the major work,\nMozart's Requiem, which was competently performed by the choir and the four soloists:\nRhianon James(Soprano), Johanna Peters (Contralto),\nJohn Stoddart (Tenor), and Kenneth Sandford (9as s Baritor.e). Instrumental ac com panem er.t provided\nby Christooher Shaw at the oia no and the\nJacques Strir^ Orchestra, was above reproach.\nWe congratulate Dr. Eric Brown on a very\nfine performance and look forward to many more,\nTHOSE VULGAR HOOLIGANS, the Rigger Club have\nstarted to wreck the New Union fit ment s already.\nAt the end of last term the quite charming gentlemen members of the Boat Club, who had been extra\ncareful when washing behind their ears that day,\nwere sitting pea cafu.1 ly in the Union Lounge\nreading their Bibles or listening to the Third\nProgramme when in rushed those badly brought-up\nfellows. The b ter besotted louts kicked in the\ntop of the Union1\ns radio and then proceeded to\nfill it with beer.\nA STRONG ARM OF THE LAW broke into the last\nCouncil Meeting and demanded an interview\nwith our President. A plaque Inscribed\n\"Emergency Exit\" is being fitted to the\nback door of the Council Room which ppen s into the area behind the building.\nActually 'Honest Stan1\nhad no cause for\nworry.

    "content": "SPORT\nRUG GER CLUB IN CORNWALL April 1st.All Fools' Day - and first nan\nto play one of the traditional jokes ins none\nother then the College jester, Brian Oggi, who\nis also I.e. Bugger Secretary. His victims\nwere high spirited rug ger players, for whom\nha produced what our correspondent described\nas an aged and rattling bone shaker to convey\nthem on their week-long invasion of Cornwall.\nThis world-weary wagon managed to reach the\nDorchester Aims, Hook, but shortly afterwards\nfilled its own interior with choking fumes,\nand with the emission of a great column of\nsteam from its radiator and a puddle of oil from its under-ball y, shuddered to a stands till in the middle of Salisbury Plain. The\ndriver was undaunted by this apparent disaster\nand, after a40 minute rest, he gently cajoled\nhis charge for a further mile or so where tha\ncontents of a cow-trough were poured into the\nradiator. The first half gallon shot straight\nout in the form of superheated steam, but soon\nwe were off again and reached Falmouth at mid-night} though not before visiting the famous\nJamaica Inn, where the co-operative and willing\nnature of young Cornish womanhood first came\nto the notice of the Vice-Captain and his as-soci at es.; The first match, against Falmouth, was\nplayed in misty and difficult conditions, and\nto the undisguised delight of I.C. supporters,\nwas won by 9 points to nil. The whole team\nplayed with great spirit and determination and\nthoroughly deserved a notable victory. Stone\nkicked two penalty goals and began a movement\nwhich provided Berryman with a try on the left.\nThose who remembered our defeat two years ago\nled an uproarious celebration, which continued\nlate into, the night at a Falmouth supporters'\nclub dance.\nIt was at this dance that the President was\ncoerced into giving his own rendering of\n\"Singing The Blues\", and was only persuaded to\nstop when told by the House Manager that tha\nnoise might attract the police.\nAt this function, a frolicsome filly of\nFalmouth with, it was rumoured, the scalps of\nmany previous visiting captains under her belt,\nmade passionate advances on the I.C. skipper,\nD.M. Thomaa. This stolid example of self-effacing\nBritish manhood at first seemed hooked - even\nto the extent of buying and drinking lemonade!\nHowever later in the week he produced an effective hand-off, and completed the tour bat-te red, beer y and bruised, but unconquered.\nIa describing the newt match, against Penzance, your correspondent quotes from the\nWestern Morning News': \"The match between\nPenzance and Imperial College, which tha\nformer won 19-3, was one of the most attractive\nseen on the ground for a oma time. The Collage\ntreated a very good impression by their open\nrugby and sound tackling, and well deserved tarn\ns wm tion they received as they left the field. ma visitors ware most unlucky, for after only\nthree minutes they lost their right-centre.\nB. Hearn, with a fractured collar-bone. Although\nopposed by \u2022 side which contained seven county\nplayers the College vent into their task wits\na will. They were 14 points down at the interval,\nbut conceded only one further try In the \u2022\nclosing minutes the College reaped a deserved\nreward for their pluck when Stone scored a brilliant try which was not converted.\" It may a a ea invidious to praise Individuals after am cha splendid team display, but eighteen year old\nA. Seed, I.C.2 nd XT scrum-half, rose to the\noccasion and played a fine game under pretty\ntough conditions.\nSo to Penryn, where revenge was sought for\na narrow and unlucky defeat two years ago. Alas,\ntwo hard matches had left their mark, and with\none' or two unavoidable team-changes, I.C. had\nlost their sparkle and went down i naclo a e fight 6-0. One member of the party attributed\ndefeat to the decision to play Stone, with \u2022\nbroken toe, in preference to the A IVf lp*4 amf who, although) not quite match fit, at least\nboasted an entire skeleton beneath his ample\ncovering.\nThe extraordinary proceedings that followed\nthe Penryn game cannot ba recorded here. They\ni included a masterly commando raid, whose aim\nwas to gain entry into a late-drinking establishment perched on top of a steep hill. The\nobjects of this venture were successfully accomplished without loss of life, despite loose\nboulders and stinging nettles, and Thomas\nbecame Keeper of the Privy Key. Tou can hear\nfurther details in the bar.\nThus ended a fine tour with a great spirit. The writer's only regret is that B. Stone's carefully laid plan to get Oggi paralytic and\nthen cut his hair off could never be implemented.\nSQUASH CLUB Once again it is possible to say\nthat the club looks back on a good\nseason. With potentially one of the\nbest teams for a number of years.\nThe few falling s must be attributed to poor form rather than lack of\nskill. A notable example of this was\nIn the U.L.3 \u00bba \u00bbsl de tournament when\nthe 1 st team lost to King's. A little more concentration and decisiveness would have resulted In a victory over\nless. skillful, but more enthusiastic opponents. Later in the season this defeat was avenged when King's were'\nbeaten by 4 ties to 1.\nPerhaps the most enjoyable and\nInstructive match of the season was\nagainst Whitehouse. This time in all eases the skill of the opposition far excelled the skill of the I.C. team\nand the latter had to counterattack by\nvirtue of their Superior fitness, by\nplaying as robusta game as was possible This almost paid dividends against the\nolder opposition. The second team h ft s been un for tu nate in all sorts of ways; injuries, power failures, last minute can cell at \u00bb\nIons etc., but nevertheless has still managed to emerge with about a90% record of wln sL Pull colours have been awarded to\nP.D. Stevens and half colours to 0.\nHodgson and H. Mills. WHITKLY CUP TOURNAMENT.\nJohn Br al thwaite played John Hart\nin the final of White ly Cup for the\nthird successive year but carried off the trophy for the first time by winn-ing in the fifth game. Tha match,\nthough not of the highest technical standard, was full of the tension; that i sea parc ted In a final, tension, that was passed from the players to the crowd in the gallery. U th let ics season opens The term's activities began with the I.C. trials held on Wednesday,\n84th. April and then a match against Westminster on Saturday, 27th, which\nwe won in no uncertain fashion by\n90 pts SI pts. despite th* fact that th* team was 'weakened, by\nmembers attending the U.L. trials. Westminster men won two of th a fourteen events.\nk full report of Sports day\n(May 1 st) sad the U.L. Champs, will be given in the next Issue. One event\nheld last term still has to be re,ported, this being the Intercollegiate3 mile a, won narrowly by R.C.S. from\nGuilds and Mines. The points were\n27-30-71. The individual winner,\nJohn Evans, set up a new College Record\nof 14 mins. 12 sees. - an excellent performance on a muddy track. This event forms part of Sports Day.\nEASTER HOCKEY FESTIVAL As in past years, the hockey\nfestival organised by N.F.L. at\nTeddington was a great success. I.C., had three stiff matches against Teddington on Friday, N. P.L. on\nSaturday and Old Kingston lans on Monday. The Friday match was a shambles,\nI.C. being beaten 5-1. Saturday, howe ver, proved to be a better day, and\nI.C. fought a33. draw with N. P.L. Monday's match was a damp uninspired affair,' I. C.losing20. to Old Kingston lans. General impressions af the\nfestival were good, the bar open all day. a good snooker table, plenty of\nbeer and, sandwiches.\nA very successful festival all round.\nCROSSCOUNTRY The Club finished off a successful season with members taking part in three events;\nOn Wednesday, March 27th the\nInter college3 mile Championships\nwas held, in which most members participated. In the evening the Club held Its annual'Bar Race' In which members\nrun from the Club not l ce board Into the\nBar, 'swallow' a pint of bitter and\n'run' back. - The winner was the Club\nPresident, John Evan3 In a time of\n19.1 S9cs; Bill Lampkln was second\nIn 19.'5 sees and Chris Grav lna third in19.6 sees.\nCn Saturday, March 30th the Club\nentered four members In the gruelling Wlgmore Harriers15 mile Road Race held over s hilly lap course round Hampatead\nHeath. One member, however, had second\nthoughts on the subject and decided not\nto run. As a result there were only3 I.C. men among the 132 at art9 ra. After7 i miles Mike Sanderson had\nto drop out with bleeding feet. Howe ver, John Collins rana' blinder' passing th ro'th*10 mile point In 3\nml ns. under the hour to finish21 st in a time of 87 mins. 41 sees.

    "content": "FELIX elf\nCONFERENCE, LIVERPOOL ASPECTS OF UNIVERSITY LIFE DISCUSSED\nThe hosts of the third inter var s lt les Informal conference were Liverpool University, and the delegates from 27\nUniversities and Colleges,63 people\nIn all were aci^ay si dated at Derby Hall shall of reald endo In the suburbs of\nLiverpool. A very full agenda had been prepared for discussion.\u00bb the back grp und of this meeting being not tot formally pass\nmotions or recommendations but rather to promote the Interchange of experience in the running of Student Unions\nan il their subsidiary bodies. A discussion of the Union buildings,. catering facilities, bar, and finance so io f^H? ng^ fc\n^ H\"1**^ She university brought to light some 1 \u2122*/f?l\" \"\u00ab\u00ab. \" ^ deplored and It the University brought to light of the difficulties that beset many\nunions in their struggle for financial stability. Interesting comments were\nmade with respect to Union bars and\nthere was a surprising number of universities where the male-female\nratio is lower than a tI.C., that were endeavour ing to create men only' bars or solve the problem of women\nin their union bars. Entertainments, Indeed a major\nfunction of any union, promoted a lively j exchange and It became apparent\nthat many unions treat their functions as another source of finance. The\nsystem of running hops Is fairly stan dard although diversity In the quality of club hops was noticeable. Some\nunions do not allow clubs to run hops\nwhereas at others the clubs vie with each other to give better dances with out any profit Incentive. University women seemed reluctant' to go to union hops\nor perhaps it was that outside girls were more eager.\nSome apprehension was felt about\nthe cultural activities that were\nbeing sponsored by the university authorities and unions felt that they\nwould like to encourage an active* n\"ter^ st in out of college efforts. A discussion on the purpose of university education led somewhat long winded ly to the conclusion that the\nl hr or mal conference was not the place to attempt such a topic considering th a time available. Staff student relationships In some of the unions are encouraged;others are in opposition to the point of phobia. A lot of inter a st was shown in our hall di nner system and although many unions\norganised tea parties etc. they were\nsomewhat ineffectual. Expansion Is very fashionable and\nconcerns all unions, the problem of\na growing student body and already1 Inadequate facilities is forcing all manner of emergency measures on the\nunions. The standard of architecture of\nwas\nfelt that a much higher standard should\nshould be aimed at, and that planning at the earliest possible stages should take place between responsible student\nbodies and the planning staff. The\nprovision! of student Halls of Residence\nwith increasing numbers Is a common\nfalling In all universities though it seems that the newer universities have a disproportionate number of\ntheir students In halls compared with the well established universities. The regulations regarding students living In lodgings and flats was most\nIllustrative of the reluctance of some university authorities to allow the students any self determination. Such phrases , In connection with the question of flats were heard;\nover 21; over 23; 3 rd. year; postgraduates only; fathers' written per mls s) Ion; which only Indicates the diversity of university administration. Other questions such as debates,\nelections voting system, freshmen receptions brought the lively discussion that comes of conviction In ones\nmethods. -The amount of .co as a ent! that we have\nfound useful Is doubtless less than'\nthe unions that are not so well run\nand stable as Imperial College but the\ncontribution ws can make Is Indeed\nvery large and the Informal conference\nIs the ideal opportunity. I.C.ON THE TELLY On April 12th. the Rector and certain\nmembers of various engineering departments appeared\nin a B.B.C. television programme. This programme\noutlined some of the steps being taken to increase\nthe output of scientists and technologists for\nindustry and was complementary to this year's Reith Lectures in which Sir Edward Appleton\nspoke of Industry's growing demands for highly\n'brained personnel.\nShots of practical work In progress, filmed\nsoma weeks before, included a close up of the\nVice-President of Guilds and some unusually\nattentive aero students (obviously camera\nconscious) diligently talc ing lecture notes. The\nSector spoke of the expansion programme at tha\ncollage and outlined the work already seder\nway. The Important position la supplying the\nneeds of industry held by Imperial Collage,\nsow recognised by the government, was\nemphasised.\nHEAD OF THE RIVER The Thames Head of River Race showed that this year there are many crews\nof equal capabilities.

DRAMATIC SOCIETY'S EASTER PRODUCTION\nOn March 25th.,26 th., and 27th.,I. CD .3.\npresented, as their second major production in the new Union Building, a farcical comedy by\nTalbot Rothwell, \"Queen Elisabeth Slept Here\".\nThis tells of the misfortunes that befall a young\ncouple who -buy a tumbledown country cottage and\nhave to brave the hardships of a rural existence:\nas with most farces, the story is of secondary\nimportance, and the author uses it merely as a framework for a series of comic situations.\nWhile there is much in the play which will appeal\nto most people with a suitably-developed sense\nof humour, there is also much which can be described only as \"corny\".\nThe standard of acting was on the whole very\nhigh, though, perhaps not surprisingly with so\nmany characters, there was a certain amount of\nmiscasting. The pace of the production was also\ngood, and the producer, Graham Matthews, must be\ncongratulated on his handling of the large and\ncomparatively inexperienced cast.\nThe actors were well supported by tha\ntechnical departments, and In particular the\nmany and varied sound-effects helped to create\na suitably rustic' atmosphere. Altogether\nan enjoyable evening's entertainment, though\nnothing more.\nCRICKET TRIALS\nCr lok et trials were held in H arlington as usual. In view of the large attendance at Is hoped that I.C.s hs ll be able to run 3 teams this summer.\nThe first team opened the season\nwith an away fixture at Wye against Wye Sol leg e. The team Included three fresh sr s In Hare, Hackett, and Kapur,\nIn addition to the recognised talent In Kitchener, Sheppard, Bhatt i and\nWhlddon. I.C. batted first and were\nall out for54 runs.

Kitchener started the season as usual with a single, and whl d don with a duck.\nWye College batted Just as badly at\nthe start. They were 6 wickets down\nfor19 runs at one stage but managed\nto win without further loss. Bhatt i bowled well taking4 wickets for23 runs In 10 overs.\nThe evening opened partly at George's and partly at the hop in. the college union.

VICKERS LTD. HAD\nDONATED 2150,000 FOR THE ERECTION OF AHALL OF RESIDENCE. THIS DONATION\nWILL ENABLE THE COLLEGE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF\nTHE PRINCES GARDENS SITE.\nThe new Hall will be known as the\nWeeks Hall will be built at the east\nend of the northside of the Gardens.\nIt will accommodate seventy students and we understand that it is hoped to\nbe opened im the autumn of 1959.\nThe drawing of the 'proposed i design' which appeared in several newspapers had been pirated By the\npr^sss. The architects spent several weeks trying to find where it had\ncome from. This drawing gave only an indication of the probable architectural style of the buildings of\nthe Princes Gardens project. No plans have yet been officially released. However, some time ago the Planning Department disclosed that the architects, Messers. Richard Sheppard\nand Partners, were taking some inspiration from the design of the ex-cell ent new student accommodation\nwhich is being erected in Paris; thun It appears that the published drawing may not be far removed from .\nthe actual design. It is rumoured that money left over from the Vickers' donation( if: any) will be sunk in the swimming\npool that has be ed proposed.\nVickers have also announced that they propose to award 15 scholarships for engineering at Imperial College with residence in Weeks Hall. WINNER OF BEARD\nCOMPETrrtON\nCHAIR OF NUCLEAR POWER f THE WINNER ROBIN SUTTON\nON MONDAY, THE 25TH. OF MARCH, onlookers in the Union Lounge gazed with envious eye at the\ncollection of facial fungi assembled there.\nEven more envious, however, were the expressions\nwhen a full bottle of the best Scotch potato\nfermentation appeared on the scene, together,\nhowever, with an enormous shaving brush inscribed with a Felix-type cat. The Board of\nJudges took their seats while the Editor en ounce d the names of the competitors, whose beards ranged\nfrom a diminutive chin embellishment to a thick,\ncave-man-like growth.\nThe competition was divided into four cate gor ies, together with an over-all winner. After\nmuch deliberation and intensive examination of\neach hairy prot ruber ance, the Board declared\nRobin Sutton to ba the winner. Amid great ova-tion, he received the two prizes. They both\ncame in useful - while whetting his whistle with\nwhisky, me warded off would-be drinkers with his\nwooden weapon - the Brush.\nWhen half a bottle had been con some d, he very\ngenerously passed the bottle to the judges and\nthe Editor no comment i After further consultation, the judges made\ntha following awards:\nThe THICKEST heard: Robin Sutton\nThe JUnHEST board: Colin Drake\nThe MOST AESTHETIC beard: Alan Thomas\nThe beard WITH THE HOST\nSEX-APPEAL: Brian Ellis\nThe last dec l sls n was made by the female portion of the Board only - Wendy Pipe ant Elisabeth\nKrink, m ho called in Susan Coombs to make a casting vote, as they ware undecided.\nB* this time, tarn contents of the bottle of\nlla vor sad disappeared, mostly down the throats\nOf th. male members of the Board; tads probably a eo eo at a for t ne miserable express!**\nen the face of Robin Sutton in the photograph.\nRENDEZVOUS Again this years Guild soar nl val was\na/ scene of uninhibited Sport. Right from the start the well planned organ-is ation went astray. At8.45 pm. a, policeman 4 the back of the Albert Hall scratched the back of his head\nin amazement as he watched J a dozen\nstriped shirted students belting around\nthe corner with a small trolley on\nwhich a piano rested in unstable eq ull tb rum There being no clause in the Law dealing with being drunk in cha- ge of a plano, he had .no alter nat ive but to let them pass. It was\njust as well he did, otherwise there would have been no dancing.\nThree.bands entertained those\ncouples who had not already found\nentertainment of their own; and the\nbar did some lively trade until2 am, the effects of which were to be seen\nthroughout the evening.'\nThe cabaret, as usual, went its own\nsweet way, despite the rehearsals and\nChad's prompting. Two minutes before the certain was due to go up, the leading( or one and only) lady was being held from her hands halfway up the\nwings In order to d top the hiccoughs\nwhile other members of the cast were\ncompletely horizontal being made up.\nThe b'g worry was that John Hart, Guilds Fr esl dent, would be carried away by his performance In the first act and cc n trove ne all standards of\ndecency. \u00abiu lte what went on or came\noff behind the kiosk, nobody knows,\nbut we w are nss p red that the feminine screams were genuine.\nOur correspondent regretted that his report was totally inadequate,\nas he couldn't remember more than\nhalf the evening, and h's was the\nonly one to be written. This would\nnot have been the case had the Evenln g Standard reporter done her job, but\nunfortunately she was last seen leaving the Union horizontal, being. sup-ported by two members of the cabaret, who by this time could only just stand.\nShe was laid carefully down on the -.\nfloor of a cab, and the driver told' FleetS tee et'.'

Hostel,\nDear Sir,\nWithout professing to go into detail\n(not being qualified enough to do so), as to\nwhich of the tie knots is better, one cannot\nIgnore completely the fact that this particular\naspect of a man's dress has not received tha\nsame attention within the scholastic walls of\nour College, as outside. Though one cannot wait\nfor the day when \"every man, young or old, will have a personal tie knot ( and, incidentally,\nhair style) suitable to his age, face and chara c ter\" is it too much to hope and desire that the\ntia knot, the object of which is to draw attention\nto the face, \"the seat of man's character\", and\nnot entirely to conceal the collar stud, will have our more immediate attention ?\nTours etc.,\nJJ\u00bb.Puri.\nSear Sir, Since woman are ao esp ted into f sts \u00a9e ii eg* on equal basis with man, why are they 'barred\nfrom tha bar'? This unwritten it t mj soft s', casts a sordid shadow over I.C. bar and is apt\nto a at an outsider's Imagination working a ler* the wrong lines. I as sure that \u2022 sale's privacy will not be endangered in any way because women are invited in by other males for\na drink. The atmosphere and general aspect of\nthe bar will definitely be l mo roved by their\npresence and, whatever is said against the idea)\nit works perfectly well In pu be. Tours sincerely,\nR. Rocchini\nC.&G. Potsdam,\nNew York,\nDear Sir,\nI wonder if you could help me with a little problem I have. When I was at CAG in'51-54,\nI was familiar with a ditty which was something\nabout \"We're going to see the Hamburg Zoo\". This\nis completely unknown on this side, and I would\nlike to introduce it, but find I have almost fox)\ngotten it. Perhaps you and your colleagues could\nfurnish me with the (authentic) words and tune;\nthe solo parts are especially important.\nI trust \"Felix\" is still in the best of he a j l and full of fleas - I mean activity.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n* Regards,\nAlan Phillips.\nEditor's Note: Please send all verses to \"Felix\"\nwho will pass them on to Mr. Phillips.\nDear Sir,\nI am rather puzzled by the variations in position of SCIEKTIA on the open book of the\nI.C. crest. A quick, survey of the Union shows\nthree distinct schools of thought :- the\nSCI-ENTIA S. of T.; the SCIE-NTIA S. of T. the\nSCIEN-TIA S. of T. The followers of the first have the least\nsupport, their only emblem being the large crest\nin the bar. The other two both have more followers. SCIE-NTIA appears on the stage back cloth,\nthe new embossed chairs, the pel met in the committee room, on the bust of Sir Otto Beit in the\narchway and on some of the pots. The other pots\nbelong to the SCIEN-TIA S. of T., with the small\ncrest behind the bar, the crest over the Union\nentrance, the blazer badge and the note pao er headings. The large quantities of printed notepaper and blazer badges sway the count towards\nthe latter, but is sheer weight of numbers\nenough for this to be accepted as correct?\nIn these clays of standardisation and mass-production much individuality is being lost and\nevery effort should be made to preserve character,\nbut surely in this case the variations are merely\nodd and not of an individual character, standardisation would therefore be an advantage.\nBy the way, which is correct?\nTours etc,\nJ.C. Wright\n(Editor's Note. Our Heraldic correspondent writes\nthat,having considered fully the merits and\ndemerits of each of the above vers i or. s, and after\nhaving consulted suitable authorities, the\nlast version is-perhaps less incorrect than the\nl st. and 2t.d. versions.)\nKEEP OFF THE GRASS'\nThe College resumed activity this term to\nfind that the unsightly mess of the quadrangle\nhad beer, removed and in its place a pleasant\nformal garden laid out. There will not b \u00ab, it seems, any \"Keep off the Grass\" notices, presumably since they would not remain in situ for\nlong-, but all are asked to cooperate in keeping\nthe garden in its present condition by adhering\nstrictly to the paths.\nOur tame botanist reports that the trees\nplanted in the 'quad' include a Silver Birch\n(Betula); a flowering Cherry (which masquerades\nunder the name of Prunus Cereasus); four Hornbeams (Carpinus). (Our Racing Correspondent\nassures that no similarity is intended to\nthe horse which arrived 4th.in the Derby SUA.\nwon him 4id last week). An Indian Bean Tree\n(Catalpa) will grace the lawn on the Zoology side,\nand maybe provide Mr. Mooney with a slight\naddition to his n anus. In future years, hostel\nresidents will bless the foresight of their\npredecessors as they ascend the boughs of the\nRed Oak, who a e boughs will perhaps gracefully\nbrush against the windows of the third floor of\nthe new hostel.\nPrinces Gardens nave also been opened \"to\nmembers of the College. \u00ab\nHo rules have beer, made Tor the use of those\noW rdens, and none should be necessary.
