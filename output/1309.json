He asserts that without\nradical changes to the way it is\nfunded, motivated and practised,\ncivilisation itself is under threat.\nBraben lays out his thesis effectively in the introduction, drawing\nthe reader to commit to the book\nand his ideas. He explains that\nwhile science and technology are\nthe basis of civilisation, they are\ntaken for granted \u2013 the source of the\nadvances that have transformed our\nworld is rarely considered. Now this\nsource \u2013 truly innovative research \u2013\nis threatened by widespread obsessions with safety, control and pre-dictability. \u201cHumanity has reached\na crucial point in its development.\u201d\nDespite the early promise of the\nintroduction, the opening chapters\nare sadly rather awkward. Braben\ntakes too long developing his definition of \u2018dissent\u2019, the tendency to find\nthe status quo unbearable and hope\nfor and plan future improvements.\nHe sees this as the unique and\ndefining character of the human\nanimal, the key to its success.\nThe \u2018back of an envelope\u2019 account\nof human history, from the evolution of Homo erectus to the industrial revolution, is also hard going.\nDespite acknowledging that better\nhistories of humanity are in no short\nsupply (Jared Diamond\u2019s excellent\nGuns, Germs, Steel is one that is\nrecommended), Braben proceeds\nnonetheless.\nI have to admit that the ardour\nof your intrepid reviewer wavered\nsomewhat after the opening chap-ters. Fortunately things soon get\nback on track; Braben is far more\nauthoritative and interesting when\nwriting on the problems posed by\nthe success of science, the failings\nof science policy and his proposed\nsolutions.\nHistorically, researchers generally worked alone or in very small\ngroups, and were self-directed.\nAt the turn of the 20th century,\nthis began to change, industrialists grouped together researchers\nto create new opportunities, and\ngovernments soon also developed\nresearch infrastructures to sustain\ntheir industrial societies.\nThe result was sustained success \u2013 industrial development and\neconomic growth continued apace.\nEconomists dub the period covering\nthe fifties, sixties and early seventies as \u2018the golden age\u2019 of economic\ngrowth, and technology advanced\nrapidly during this time. However,\nsubsequently, science became a victim of its own success.\nThe number of working scientists\nincreased greatly, and this presented the authorities with the twin\nproblems of which research to fund,\nand how to fund it. Braben pins the\ncause of the crisis facing research\nand humanity on the policies used\nto allocate funding in an ever more\ncrowded profession. Governments\nand industry alike have sought to\nmaximise the effectiveness of their\nresources, allocating on the basis of\nprojected return from their investment in research.\nUnfortunately research is an\ninherently unpredictable business.\nFew of the most important and\ninfluential scientific breakthroughs\ncould ever have been forecast by\nany committee. An investment in\nresearch is like no other.\nBraben\u2019s theory is that we should\nstop second-guessing research and\ndo away with bureaucratic obsessions with safety and control: \u201cThe\ngeese that lay the golden eggs are\nincreasingly being farmed and\nfocused, it is no wonder that our\nmagical geese have become egg-bound in recent times.\u201d He claims\nthat a drastic overhaul of the way\nthat research is funded and managed will fix this problem. More\nnovel products of research will drive\neconomic growth and safeguard\nhumanity.\nBraben has a powerful example of\nhis ideas in action, in BP\u2019s Venture\nResearch Unit, of which he was\nfounder and chairman. During the\n1980s, the oil giant ploughed millions of pounds into this initiative.\nThe intention was to identify scientists with the sort of innovative\nideas that would not usually get\nfunded. The usual lengthy goal-motivated, peer-reviewed proposals\nwere scrapped. The novelty of the\nscience was paramount and face-to-face discussion with applicants was\nused. Despite successful and unim-agined new findings by almost all\nthe recipients of Venture Research\nfunding, a change of management\nat BP in 1989 led to the closure of\nthe Unit.\nThe book can be characterised\nas one side of a discussion on the\nfuture of science. The continued\nexpansion of professional science\nhas led to the development of\nbizarre bureaucracies to allocate\nresources. Researchers find themselves having to play the game to\nthese rules and this will necessarily\nimpact the nature of the research\ncarried out. Braben\u2019s book does a\nworthy job of highlighting these\nissues, and how they have arisen,\nbut the solutions he suggests are\nnot the only ones. There is undeniably a situation to be dealt with,\nbut many possible interpretations\nand solutions. Braben\u2019s reasoning\nand his Venture Research Initiative\nillustrates a possible route, but others surely exist.\nThis book is a stimulating read.\nHopefully it will kindle wider discussion of the way that research is\nmanaged and how more of those\nelusive golden eggs can be found to\nthe gain of humanity.\nPioneering Research:\nA Risk Worth Taking\nby Donald Braben\n(John Wiley & Sons Inc)\nHHHHI\n\u201cScience became a\nvictim of its own\nsuccess\u201d\n\u201cCivilisation itself is\nunder threat\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 9 December 2004\n10\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nTransport is a hot topic in London.\nMost people live too far from work\nto walk. Public transport can be\nexpensive for students and unpleasant for everybody. Driving is out\nof the question for the majority of\nLondoners due to clogged streets,\nlack of parking and the high cost.\nThe morning news consists of a\ncatalogue of catastrophe on road\nand rail. It is little wonder that the\nmayoral elections are dominated by\ntransport issues.\nBut there is a way out of this\nlocomotive rat race: cycling. Many\ncyclists talk as if their chosen mode\nof transport is the solution to the\nworld\u2019s problems \u2013 and it is easy to\nsee why.\nCycling is cheap. You can get a\nbrand new bike and associated gear\nfor under \u00a3200 from Halfords or\nDecathlon, and even less if you buy\nsecond hand. Alternatively you could\nget something a bit more luxurious\nfor around \u00a3400 from a local bike\nshop \u2013 still far cheaper than your\naverage Travelcard, but it will last\na good few years. And you won\u2019t be\npaying to stand stationary in a tunnel for half an hour with your face in\nsomeone else\u2019s armpit.\nCycling is fast. Transport for\nLondon figures suggest that cycling\nis the fastest mode of transport in\ncentral London. You can travel four\nmiles in just 20 minutes, compared\nto half an hour by tube or an hour\nby bus. And cycling is door-to-door\n\u2013 chances are most of your commute is spent walking to and from\nstations.\nCycling gets you fit. The obesity\nepidemic is in full swing, and you\ncan be sure that sitting on a bus eating crisps is doing nothing for your\nphysique. Regular cycling halves\nyour chances of suffering from heart\ndisease. The Government recommends that adults get 30 minutes of\nmoderate exercise five times each\nweek. Cycling to College will give\nyou all that and more, without wasting precious time and money in the\nlocal gym.\nCycling is fun. While initially the\nprospect of getting on a bike is\ndaunting, it rapidly becomes easier and more rewarding. There\u2019s\nnothing more satisfying than arriving at your destination having\ngot there under your own steam.\nYou\u2019ve cut through the traffic, flown\npast the bus queues and bypassed\nthe crowded stations, using your\nnatural strength, skill and dexterity\nto get from A to B. You can make\nit an exhilarating everyday extreme\nsport or a scenic ride through\nparks and along waterways \u2013 your\nchoice.\nAnd finally, of course, cycling is\nenvironmentallyandsociallyrespon-sible. It is unlikely you\u2019ll end up killing anyone with your bike, unlike\ncars which result in the deaths of\n3500 people in the UK each year.\nEvery other mode of transport bar\nwalking uses energy derived from\nfossil fuels. Those who aren\u2019t convinced by global warming (both of\nyou) will nonetheless have experienced the unpleasant side-effects\nof walking along London\u2019s choked\nstreets. Biofuels are here today: two\nslices of toast and a coffee goes in,\nand out comes enough energy to get\nyou to College (and a little bit of, er,\nexhaust). Imagine London\u2019s streets\nwithout the noise and smell and\ndanger of motor vehicles. You can\nmake it happen.\nWhat\u2019s the down side? There\u2019s\nalways a down side. People are put\noff by bad weather: in fact, London is\nthe driest part of the UK and only a\ntiny fraction of your journeys will be\nwet. You can choose to take the day\noff and get back on the tube (you\u2019ll\nremember why you started cycling)\nor just get some waterproofs and\ncarry on regardless.\nSome people are worried they\u2019ll\nget to College reeking of sweat and\nfumes. You might be lucky and have\nodourless sweat \u2013 just wear clean\nclothes every day, use a deodorant,\nand your popularity will be main-tained. Alternatively take a shower\nat College instead of at home. A\nmap of College showers is being\nprepared \u2013 every department has\none or two tucked away somewhere.\nSee these pages for news in the\ncoming weeks, or ask your head of\ndepartment.\nDanger from cars and buses is\nalso quite off-putting for novices. A\nprerequisite is that you are a competent cyclist when on traffic-free\nroutes. Take it easy for the first few\nweeks and you\u2019ll build up experience of how to deal with London\u2019s\ntraffic. Kensington and Chelsea\nlocal authority offer free cycle safety\ncourses \u2013 email road.safety@rbkc.\ngov.uk. You could prepare yourself\nfor the open road with Cyclecraft by\nJohn Franklin (ISBN: 0117020516),\na book which is widely regarded as\nthe authority on cycle safety. My\npersonal top tips are: don\u2019t ride in\nthe gutter, ignore cycle lanes, be\naware of what is going on around\nyou, use lights, and observe the\nHighway Code.\nThe last hurdle is parking and\nsecurity. Cycle parking at Imperial\nhas taken a nosedive over summer.\nThe handy parking outside your\ndepartment has gone, replaced by\nmotorcycle and car parking. You\nmust now use a swipe-carded cage\nup some stairs under the Big Blue\nFaculty building.\nThe racks are tough to use, but\nwith some creativity and practice\nthey are almost as secure as street\nparking, and they are undercover.\nYou must register with Security\nbefore your swipe card will work.\nElsewhere in London, the Mayor\nhas handed cyclists a small army of\nexcellent cycle racks, so you can do\nyour shopping or go to the cinema\nin confidence. The parking in High\nStreet Kensington actually won a\ndesign award last year.\nA cycling group is being set up\nat Imperial, which will campaign\nfor better facilities and generally\nsupport cyclists. The first stage is\na mailing list, http://mailman.ic.ac.\nuk/mailman/listinfo/bike-users. Old,\nnew and future cyclists are encouraged to subscribe, ask advice and\noffer wisdom.\nYour student years are the best\ntime to start cycling, when body\nand bank balance are likely to be\nless than healthy. When you disappear to your career in merchant\nbanking, you might end up chugging\naround in a BMW or sweating it\nout on the tube. But chances are\nyou\u2019ll find it hard to kick the cycling\nhabit.\nWhy cycling is the answer\nBen Jefferys explains why travelling by good old-fashioned push-bike is beneficial to both\nyou and the environment\n\u201cMany cyclists talk as if their chosen mode of transport is the solution to the world\u2019s problems \u2013 and it is easy to see why\u201d\nBy Vikas Kaura\nI should not be writing this in a state\nof anger, however, I will.\nWhy is it that Londoners (well,\nthose on the tubes) are so socially\ninept? Is it so hard for a 20-year-old\nto give up his seat to an older gentleman with a walking stick? Well\nI guess so, as this is what I have\njust observed and it is not a one-off\ncase. I use the tube every day and,\nday in and day out, I see the same\nthing \u2013 the elderly get pushed to the\nback at the platform and crushed in\nthe middle on the trains rather than\nhaving seats vacated for them.\nWhat is it about London that\nmakes people think less than certain \u2018lower\u2019 species of animals?\nBack in Newcastle I am sure,\nalthough we sound very uncivilised,\nwe conform to a much better moral\nstandards than our London counterparts do. Even though trains are\nless frequent, I know the majority of\nGeordies would give up their seat or\neven just wait at the platform for the\nnext train if we were to see 70-year-olds struggling to get on.\nIs it too much to ask of people to\nstand for 15 minutes of their life or\nput their plans on hold for a minute\nor two by catching the next tube?\nIs it such a hinderance on your life\nto allow an older person in a fragile\nstate to have a comfortable journey\nat your expense? Well it seems so!\nAlthough, rather than painting a\ncompletely negative picture, I did\nalso see a rarity: on the same train, a\nyoung lady swiftly vacated her seat,\nallowing an old lady to sit down. The\nold lady was so happy and thankful.\nI presumed that the girl was either\na \u2018northerner\u2019 or from abroad. It\nis a sad situation when people are\nrendered to think along these lines,\nbut can you blame me after observing the normal London tube users\u2019\nbehaviour?\nTo conclude, I would urge everyone to try to smile on the tube\n\u2013 it makes your journey a lot better,\ntrust me. Break this vicious circle of\ndefensive body language and mis-ery. Just think, how you would feel\nwhen you are in your seventies and\nfragile, yet a youth of 20 cannot show\nyou some moral decency.\nLondon transport etiquette\n\n"

The Budget report\nwas very political indeed this\nyear, which hints that Labour\nwill be using the economy as\nthe centre of their general\nelection campaign.\nThe pre-budget report was\nwidely described as being\nunexciting, focusing as it did\non causes that nobody could\nmoan about. The Telegraph\ndid, admittedly, have a go, but\nit was a bit half-hearted: \u201cIf\nthis is the man who is likely\nto personify Labour\u2019s next\nincarnation in power, it is vital\nto know what he proposes to\ndo with the national wealth\nwhose growth he believes is\nhis achievement. Yesterday,\nhe gave a clear and ringing\nanswer to that question: he\nintends to spend it.\u201d\nThe most important ideas\nthat the Chancellor put forward were all based on the\nfamily: to increase paid maternity leave to nine months, to\nextend nursery places and\nthe Sure Start scheme, and to\ngive single parents an extra\n\u00a340 per week if they go back to\nwork. All very voter-friendly.\nThe Sun described the\nChancellor as \u201cspraying \u00a350\nnotes at babies, mums and\ndads\u201d \u2013 nothing to complain\nabout there, you would think.\nThe proposals are also, how-ever, really rather expensive.\nThis surprised a lot of people\nwho were expected some sort\nof mention of the fact that the\neconomy appears to be down-turning, and that Brown\nmight not meet his famous\nbut strict self-imposed Golden\nRule \u2013 that spending matches\ninvestment over the electoral\ncycle. But those commentators had obviously forgotten\nthat this is an election year\nand therefore all facts which\nare not 100% positive and\nspinnable for the Government\nare brushed under the carpet.\nIn addition, it was pointed out\nthat the fact that this is an\nelection year means that this\nis a very short parliamentary\nsession and therefore many\nof these bills have no chance\nof becoming law before the\nHouse is closed for the elec-tion. Basically, he could say\nwhatever he wanted.\nThe Financial Times also\nwarned that the chances of\ntax rises after the election\nare high, and The Observer\npointed out that Brown is\nnearly always right, unlike\nhis \u201cself-righteous and nearly\npermanently wrong critics\u201d.\nThe proposals were very\npopular, however, and very\nBrownite in their focus on\nfamily policies and away from\nthe law, order and terrorism cocktail that had been\nthe Queen\u2019s Speech a week\nbefore. This excited a lot of\ncommentators into thinking\nthat this was Brown\u2019s manifesto and he was going to set\nout his stall for the leadership\nof the Labour party.\nPerhaps they are being a\nbit premature, but it does\nappear that Brown will have\nto do something soon, seeing\nas Blair has declared that he\nwould like to serve throughout\nthe entire (four year) term.\nSo it may be that we see some\naction from Brown before the\nelection, if he believes that it\nmay be his only chance.\nBrown and the budget\nHow the national press reacted to the Chancellor\u2019s pre-budget report\nThe Sun described the Chancellor as \u201cspraying \u00a350 notes at babies, mums and dads\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "By Andy Brown\nSilwood Park Correspondent\nIt may have come to your\nattention that most of the\nrecent articles which have\nbeen submitted to Felix from\nSilwood have revolved around\nthe consumption of alcohol.\nThis is indeed the case for\nmost universities. However,\none thing that must surely\nbe unique to us is rabbits.\nMillions of them, everywhere.\nWye has its sheep, London\nhas red buses and Silwood\nhas more rabbits than a fox\ncould dream of. Beaten down\nevery year by outbreaks of\nmyxomatosis, they are always\nkeen to show their resilience\nand bounce back by doing\nwhat rabbits do best. As well\nas our fluffy friends, it has\nrecently come to my attention that the woods of Silwood\nPark are inhabited by another\nwell known mammal: the beer\nmonkey. I would like to share\nwith you my knowledge of this\ncreature.\nIt all started with the \u2018beerienteering\u2019, one of the freshers\nevents we run here. Freshers\nare given rather hastily drawn\nmaps of hidden beer in the\n50 hectares of land we have\nhere. They\u2019re then sent on\ntheir way to find over 100 cans\nof beer before merrily returning to the bar many hours\nlater wet, covered in mud, and\nattached to various fragments\nof vegetation. This was swiftly\nfollowed by the Silwood Beer\nFestival. Both these events\nwere based around the consumption of alcohol, and during both, various members of\nthe Silwood community were\nvisited by the Silwood beer\nmonkey.\nI believed the legend behind\nthe beer monkey was well\nknown, but I have been proven wrong by the blank looks\nspread across the faces of\nthose in the Silwood bar when\nI put forward this theory.\nEver wondered why, when\nyou get home from a big night\nout, you have literally no\nmoney left over? The answer\nis the beer monkey. It is highly\nunlikely that you calculated\nexactly how to spend your\nmoney whilst at the bar in\nthat club or that your kebab\ncost exactly what you had\nleft after you left the club.\nThe fact is that the beer monkey stole your loose change.\nHe can follow you home and\ncan choose to strike at the\nmoment your guard is let\ndown, from your neighbour\u2019s\nbush or from behind the lamp\npost next to you. He will never\nharm you, he will just leave\nyou perplexed as to how you\nmanaged to spend all of your\nmoney despite a vague recollection of visiting a cash\nmachine at some point during\nthe night.\nAlong with the beer monkey is the more commonly\nknown and experienced \u2018beer\ngoggles\u2019, a mind-altered state\nexperienced by both male and\nfemales, leaving you wonder-ing: \u201cOh no, did I?\u201d\nThere is also the \u2018beer jacket\u2019, that warm invisible coat\nthat guards you from the cold\non your walk home after a\nnight out drinking, and the\n\u2018beer scooter\u2019 which safely\ntransports you from club to\nhome. This is why you cant\nremember how you got home\nthe night before and is why\nwhen asked the following\nmorning \u201cwhere did you go to\nlast night?\u201d rather than admitting \u201cer, I cant remember\u201d, \u201cI\ngot the beer scooter home\u201d is\na more than adequate expla-nation, ensuring that you got\nhome safely and had a good\nnight out.\nBeerienteering and the Silwood\nbeer monkey\nSilwood students after some \u2018beerienteering\u2019.

Such is the\nsituation with Four Day Hombre.\nDuring the A&R frenzy following\nthe release of their Radio 1 approved\ndebut single The First Word Is The\nHardest, there were many comparisons made: Elbow, Muse, Haven,\nMogwai, Jeff Buckley, The Smiths...\nthe list goes on indefinitely. As you\ncan already see from that variety,\nthis old pigeon-holing business isn\u2019t\nas easy as it\u2019s cracked up to be.\nLead track on this three song EP\n,\nMr M, starts with piano and delicate\nsemi-falsetto vocals, creating some\ndark atmospherics before the addition of some nifty slide-guitar. It\nbuilds gradually, creating an amount\nof tension before the chorus. Then\nenter spine-tingling harmonies of\nthe man-screaming type. The song\nends in a cacophony of noise before\nthe brilliant addition of the lead\nguitar\u2019s lead being pulled out and\nthrown on the floor. So it goes indie\nintro, Muse-style chorus theatrics,\nand ends in white noise. See the\nproblem?\nDrink starts slowly, and sounds a\nlot like Elbow. But then it explodes\ninto a big, bold, and loud chorus.\nThey manage to avoid the old post-rock \u2018quiet bit, loud bit\u2019 formula by\nbringing it back down for the end-ing.\nThe Boy With The Mended Heart\nbegins with snare drums and upbeat\npiano, again with very atmospheric,\ndelicate yet sky-scraping vocals. It\ndrops down to just piano and vocals\nin a truly spine-tingling way to\nfinish.\nA brilliant release from a band\ntrying to make it on their own (see\ninterview, below), may Four Day\nHombre continue to confuse music\njournalists for years to come.\nJames Millen\nAlternative Music Society President\nFour Day Hombre: talented and sadly overlooked\nLife is cheese\nFelix managed to catch up with Simon Wainwright, pin him to a chair\nand ask him about Radio 1 airplay, their new self-run label, and cheese\nINTERVIEW\nFour Day Hombre isn\u2019t these lads\u2019\nfirst band. They\u2019ve had years of\nbeing involved in bands \u201cof varying\nstyles and success \u2013 from clubland\nand beyond\u201d, explains Simon.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said for cutting your teeth and learning your\ntrade in the working men\u2019s clubs\nof Lancashire and Yorkshire...gives\nyou a certain, erm, outlook. A certain appreciation.\u201d\nThe core members met at\nLancaster University, \u201cdoing various other musical activities\u201d. Not\nhaving any real music qualifications,\nthey formed a band \u201cbecause we\ndesperately wanted to make great\nmusic... it was the only avenue we\ncould explore. Ash (drums) was an\nold mate of Ed\u2019s (keyboards) and he\ninitially came down to just lay down\nsome loops. The rest, as they say, is\nhistory\u201d.\nAfter spending a year or so out\nin the unsigned wilderness, Four\nDay Hombre emerged from their\nbasement studio with a incredible,\nself-produced single. Simon talks\nfrankly about the aftermath: \u201cWhen\nwe first got all the airplay on Radio 1\nwith The First Word Is The Hardest\nour phone just went mad with every\nA&R man, or A&R man\u2019s monkey,\ncalling us up and saying they loved\nus and could they have a full demo\nand were we playing London and\nwould we like to meet up... It was\nincredible and for a while it felt like\nwe ruled the world and all glory\nwould be ours... in a narcissistic kind\nof way.\u201d\nIn the end, though, the band turned\ndown the offers, worried about how\nthe future would pan out if they\ndid: \u201cIn the end we weren\u2019t offered\na lot \u2013 we didn\u2019t really fit any particular niche and couldn\u2019t be associated with any bandwagon.\u201d Simon\nexplains that they were seen as a\nlong shot by most of the labels, and\n\u201cmajor labels won\u2019t back long shots\nat the moment \u2013 the stakes are so\nhigh, the chances of success so slim\nand the budgets so offensively large\nthat unless you\u2019re a sure-fire seller\nor a photocopy of the latest big thing\nthen you don\u2019t really stand much of a\nchance.\u201d It was a case of \u201cnot wanting to give up our creative freedom\n\u2013 we were very independent, even\nthen.\u201d\nSetting up a record label was an\nalmost logical step from there: \u201cOver\nthe last year we\u2019ve released two\nsingles and had numerous record\ncontracts in our hands, and we\u2019ve\nbecome painfully aware that if you\nwant anything doing properly then\ndo it yourself.\u201d Since they\u2019d already\ncollected lots of creative people and\nwere \u201cdoing everything in-house\nanyway \u2013 all the artwork, the web\nstuff, the marketing\u201d they decided\nit was time to do it. \u201cWe thought we\nmight as well just make it official,\nput on our waterwings and jump\nin at the deep end. We\u2019re all strong\nswimmers.\u201d\nThough the label was set up primarily as a way of releasing their\nown records, there are plans to sign\nmore bands. Simon sees it as a\nfuture direction for the label, not\nfor at least two years: \u201cIf we\u2019re in a\nposition to get other bands recording at that point then we\u2019ll definitely\ndo it.\u201d\nHe has a few sage words of advice\nfor young bands trying to get their\nmusic heard: \u201cTry again. Fail again.\nFail better. Keep playing, at all times\njust keep playing.\u201d He has high\nhopes for the exposure potential of\nthe web: \u201cGet something on the\ninternet. For better or worse, it is\nthe future.\u201d\nFour Day Hombre relied mainly\nupon their own recording and producing skills, as Simon explains.\n\u201cTake the plunge and invest in some\nrecording gear, no matter how basic.\nIt allowed us to develop our sound\nand take away the pressure of one-day recording sessions.\u201d Wise words\nindeed.\nLastly, asked to compare his\nmusic to a Tesco Value product,\nSimon chooses \u201ccheese of a notable strength\u201d before finishing with\nthe prophetic \u201clife is cheese; ask\nanyone.\u201d\nSartre, eat your heart out.\nJames Millen\nFour Day Hombre\nSimon Wainright, vocals/guitarist\nQuote: \u201cTry again.

This is basically musical language for \u201cWe\u2019ve\nrun out of ideas and now we\u2019re going\nto nick stuff from our more successful albums\u201d.\nHowever, the Chemicals have not\ngone back to big beat but the inspiration behind that genre. They\u2019ve\ngone back to their hip-hop roots,\neven employing A Tribe Called\nQuest\u2019s Q-Tip (anyone remember\nCan I Kick It?). The big bass is still\nthere but there is a distinct lack of\ndrive in this track.\nThe repetition of the line, \u201cDon\u2019t\nhold back!\u201d in the track does not\ntranslateintothemusic,whereevery\npart of this record feels predictable,\nso much so that the climax doesn\u2019t\nfeel that climactic. Everything just\nhappens and does not demand atten-tion, nor is there the experimentation with sounds as with previous\nefforts (including the fantastic Star\nGuitar). All in all, this new single\nfrom the Chemical Brothers is as\naverage as this review.\nMatthew Hoban\nNo, no, no, no, no! If faced with\nthe prospect of having my testicles\nremoved by starved badgers or listening to this song more than once,\nthen I\u2019m afraid the life of a eunuch\nawaits me. They have really taken\nthe whole punk boy band thing to\na new level, a level where they just\nbecome a boy band.\nIf you wanted to know what N*Sync\nwould sound like if they didn\u2019t shave\nfor a couple of days and were beaten\nwith sacks full of coal as children,\nthen by all means indulge yourself\nwith this. Think of me as your sacrificial lamb; I listen to this perversely\ngrotesque excuse for music so you\ndon\u2019t have to. In fact, I deserve a cult\nwho worship me, judging from how\ntruly awful Good Charlotte are.\nIf they insist on making this kind\nof faeces-smeared life-draining\n\u2019music\u2019 then they should now be\ncalled Bad Charlotte. Bad. So they\njust wanna live, well then they\nshould give people a reason not to\nkill them. Come on boys, good men\nhave died for less in fishing and\ncooking accidents.\nMatthew Hoban\nChemical Brothers\nGalvanise\nVirgin Records\nHHHII\nGood Charlotte\nI Just Wanna Live\nEpic Records\nIIIII\n\n"

    "content": "2. The Last Samurai\nIt was an absolute travesty that this\nmovie didn\u2019t win any Oscars. Cruise\nshould have got recognition for his\nbest performance to date. Instead of\nthe usual showman, he was a more\npensive character with a lot of inner\ntorment.\nThe movie wonderfully recreated\nthe patterns and textures of the\nJapanesepast;itsproductiondesign,\nsets and costumes were astonish-ing. The battle scenes were stirring\nand elegantly mounted. They were\nless about who wins and more about\nwhat could be proven by dying.\nBeautifully designed, intelligently\nwritten, acted with conviction, this\nwas an uncommonly thoughtful\nepic. Much more than just an action\nflick.\nThe best of 2004\nAlan Ng, Film Editor, presents his top five films of the year\n3. Bad Santa\nBad Santa was a demented, twisted,\nunreasonably funny work of comic\nkamikaze style.\nSanta is a depressed, alcoholic\nsafecracker. The kid is not one of\nyour cute movie kids, but an intense\nand needy stalker. The elf is an\nangry dwarf who has been working\nwith Santa for eight years, cracking\nthe safe in a different department\nstore every Christmas.\nThe elf is fed up. Santa gets drunk\non the job, he\u2019s bonking customers\nin the Plus Sizes dressing room, and\nwhether the children throw up on\nSanta or he throws up on them is a\ntoss-up, no pun intended.\nThis movie will offend your mother\u2019s virtue, with so many four letter\nwords. It\u2019s quite possible the most\npolitically incorrect movie I\u2019ve seen\nin a long time.\nWhilst it was never going to win\nany Oscars, or smash any records\nat the box office, this was sickeningly funny.\n4. Infernal Affairs\nThe movie that inspired me to write\nabout movies \u2013 I just had to try\nto convince as many as possible\nto watch this. It was, and might\nstill be, the best movie to come out\nof Hong Kong. It combined exhilarating action with liquid nitrogen\nexistential cool, gleaming and shimmering with the city of Hong Kong\u2019s\nglass and steel. The plot twisted and\nturned, rivalling the best of thrillers\nout there. Infernal Affairs was a\ngripping thriller with grandstanding\ndrama, muscle-clenching suspense\nand two great action leads in Tony\nLeung and Andy Lau.\n1. Spiderman 2\nFew sequels surpass their predeces-sor. Spiderman 2 went past and\nwell beyond anything Spiderman\naccomplished.\nSpiderman 2 was what a superhero movie should be. It wasn\u2019t camp,\nnostalgic, it wasn\u2019t wall-to-wall special effects and it wasn\u2019t pickled in\nangst. It was simply and poignantly\na realization that being Spiderman\nis a burden that Peter Parker is not\nentirely willing to bear. The movie\ndemonstrates what\u2019s wrong with a\nlot of other superhero epics: they\nfocus on the superpowers, and shortchange the humans behind them.\nSome might say that the movie\nwas far too slow, but that\u2019s what I\nwas so impressed with \u2013 how intelligently Spiderman 2 dealt with such\nadult themes as responsibility and\nsacrifice.\nWhen it did come round to the\nfight scenes, they were superb. Doc\nOck\u2019s arms looked brilliant, with the\nchange from puppetry to CGI unno-ticeable.\nIt could have been such a one-dimensional blockbuster. Instead it\nchose to be far more intelligent, and\nleft me wanting more.\n5. Saw\nThe best horror movie I \u2018Saw\u2019 this\nyear. The final twist was so large\nand unforeseeable that I never saw\nit coming. The twists were astonishing and the pain was palpable.\nThe premise was fantastic and origi-nal. The execution was slightly less\nthan breathtaking though; the two\nlead actors were slightly erratic.\nThis was made up for by the great\ncamera work and ambience though,\nreally providing a claustrophobic\nfeel. The costume of the villain is\ngenuinely nerve wracking. It made\nthe hairs on my back stand to atten-tion, and did such a good job of scaring me that I\u2019m not even sure I want\nto buy the DVD.\nYOUR VIEWS\nDo you think this list is\nabsolute trash? Were there\nglaring omissions? Or\nmassive misjudgments?\nTell us what you\nthink\nComments to film.felix@ic.\nac.uk.

    "content": "COMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 9 December 2004 9\nImperial should be primarily\nfor the British\nDear Editor,\nI have for the last two years had\nthe impression that our Rector has\nbeen running Imperial more like a\ncorporation with profit as its incentive than an academic institution.\nLast week\u2019s front page article on\nthe massive proposed increase in\nInternational students confirms this\nalong with other measures such as\nhis ridiculous re-branding exercise\nand his love for new buildings and\nconstant refurbishment.\nI came to Imperial as an international student thinking that I was\na part of a small minority of international students who would add\nsomething to the cultural and social\nlife of the students. I now feel that I\nam actually a part of an ever growing quantity of people that are denying British students a place at a\ngood academic institution. Imperial\nis a British university supported by\ntaxpayer\u2019s money and hence should\nprimarily source Britain with much\nneeded engineers, doctors and\nscientists etc. If all the places in\nEnglish universities are taken up\nby foreign students, who then move\nback to their country, where will\nBritain\u2019s professionals come from?\nWhere should British students go to\nuniversity?\nBesides how can the Rector justify\nnot only supporting top-up fees but\nalso turning Imperial into a cash\nand carry business when at the\nsame time he plans to spend up to\n\u00a3400 million in the coming few years\non things which are not necessarily essential. For example, spending\n\u00a317 million on a sports centre is\nunnecessary when we have on of the\nmost famous parks in the world on\nour doorstep.\nHis proposals also mean that it\ndoesn\u2019t matter if two people have\nthe same intelligence, the \u2018rich kid\u2019\ngets the prize. I have not come to\nImperial because India does not\nhave good science institutions, it\nhas some that outrank Imperial. I\ncame because of its name (which I\nnow think is overrated) and because\nI was not intelligent enough to get\ninto a good science college in India,\nand off-course because mummy and\ndaddy are rich. I feel it is similar for\na lot of the International students\nthat come here.\nIf I had to do it all over again,\nI would not come to a university\nrun by a hard core capitalist. It is\nwrong to have the ex-head of a huge\ncorporation that has the reputation\nof a merciless profit maker as the\nhead Imperial. If he wishes to run\nImperial like a business, the government should withdraw its charity\nstatus. So lets start by cutting the\nuseless costs and we shall take it\nfrom there. Note, the above views\nare primarily for undergraduate\nstudies, I imagine the research community works differently.\nVeer Singh\nPhysics\nStudent discount difficulties\nDear Dave,\nI have just had a rather difficult\nexperience obtaining my student discount at HMV. Upon presentation of\nmy Imperial swipe card, the cashier\ntold me that it was for memebers of\nthe NUS only. I protested, informing\nhim that this was illegal, and asked\nto speak to a manager. The manager\ntold me the same, and asked me if I\nhad any other student ID cards.\nOpening my wallet, I spotted the\nHMV student discount card I had\npicked up at Freshers Fair and\nforgotten about, and triumphantly\npresented it. I was informed that I\nshould only have been given this if\nI had a NUS card. I told them that\nHMV staff were giving them out\nhere, and he relented, and gave me\nthe discount \u201cjust this once\u201d, telling\nme it was company policy to only\ngive discounts to member of the\nNUS. I told him this was illegal; he\ndidn\u2019t seem to care.\nHMV\u2019s website tells a different story. http://www2.hmv.co.uk/\nhmvweb/navigate.do?ctx=1099;-1;-1;-1&pPageID=1103 says \u201cIf you\nare a NUS cardholder, HMV.co.uk\nare giving away 10% off purchases\nuntil 30th September 2005. If you\ndo not have a NUS cards you will\nneed a HMV Student card to receive\nyour discount. You can get a HMV\nStudent Card from any HMV store\nin the UK or Ireland on presentation\nof valid student photo ID.\u201d\nIt would appear that HMV\u2019s staff\nare ill-informed of company policy,\nand so I will also be writing to HMV\nto inform them of this. If I had not\nbeen so persistent, I may have been\ndenied the discount.\nWhen are the retailers going to\nrealise that NUS membership is no\nlonger valid as a verification of student status?\nOliver Sinden\nMaths\nUnion sandwich prices\nDear Felix,\nLast Friday I was persuaded to go to\nour so called Student Union for dinner (or lunch as you Southern people\ncall it). After deciding against some\ndodgy looking chilli we went to the\nsandwich bar in dBs. Advertised for\n\u00a31.50 was a chicken tikka baguette,\nwhich seemed reasonable enough.\nBut on closer inspection we realised that this was the price for the\nfilling alone \u2013 it would cost another\n\u00a31 on top of the \u00a31.50 for the sand-wich, as apparently at our subsi-dised union it costs \u00a31 for a plain\nbaguette. Horrified at this, we went\nto \u2018Sandwich World\u2019 on Gloucester\nRoad where the very same chicken\ntikka baguette was available freshly\nmade for a total of \u00a31.50, plus an\noptional free piece of fruit.\nSo my point is this \u2013 if an independent sandwich shop 2 minutes\nfrom the Huxley building can produce the same sandwich and others\nlike it for around \u00a31.50 how can our\nsupposedly subsidised union charge\nan extra \u00a31? The cost of living in\nLondon is high enough as it is, without our own student services trying\nto rob us blind.\nYours faithfully,\nA hungry Northerner\nTolerance?\nDear Editor,\nI would like to complain about this\narticle on your last issue (Thursday\n2nd December 2004).\nI was very pleased to see an article dealing with the unease to be\nchristian in th 21st century and\nthink that this article had the point.\nUnfortunately, the author Victoria\nPollock tried to support her ideas\nwith charism, but a bad instance with\nthe French law banned any ostentatious faith signs in the French state\nschool. By this way, she broadcast\nnonsense about French statement\nand obviously did not realize that\nshe contradicts herself.\nThis instance have been made to\nsupport her statement that the society were tolerant until people decide\nto pursue tolerance as a definite\nobjective. And Victoria had not the\npoint on this part of her article.\nThe 1905 French Law have been\nwritten to allow children, whose religion was not christian, to have the\nopportunity to access a state school.\nThis law supported egality among\nchildren when they entered any\nstate schools. Last years this law\nhas been discussed again to reinforce the law in order to give a free\naccess to the \u201claic\u201d state schools.\nThe French Law is neither tolerant nor intolerant. We missed the\npoint. In fact, France is a laic coun-try, in which any religion have neither right nor links with the state\nautorithy. France supported last\nyear its laicity.\nI agree with Victoria that the\nFrench Republican Pact let some\nFrench unsatisfied. I agree that religions autorithy criticised the reinforcement of this Law. But Victoria\u2019s\nstatement was not supported by her\ninstance.\nI ask her tolerance for the French\nlaicity. In trying to support her belief,\nshe offends mine with this pick on\nour decision.\nBest regards,\nJeremy CH Rossiny\nConducting Ion Ceramic Membrane\nChristmas trees\nDear Editor,\nI have been noticing the growing\nnumbers of Christmas trees every-where. I even saw one shop on the\nhigh street which had about four\nof them, big ones as well. It really\ndisturbed me to think that so many\ntrees are being cut just to give us a\nbit of aesthetic pleasure. In the case\nof shops, the trees are just another\ntool to sell more and make more\nmoney by putting everyone in the\n\u201cfestive spirit\u201d. What is Christmas\nreally about anymore?\nAfter thinking about it further, it\nseems even more absurd that it is\nsupposed to celebrate the birth of\nChrist. We are killing something in\ncelebration of the birth of something\nelse. Perhaps having a small tree or\nplant in a pot or a large one if can\nafford it will be more appropriate.\nLets celebrate life.\nHappy Christmas,\nVeer Singh\nPhysics\nLetters to the Editor\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk. This is the page where you can make your voice heard on just about any topic.\nLetters may be edited for length but not for spelling or grammar, and are printed at the Editor\u2019s discretion\nJamie Brothwell seems very keen\nthat we should all buy fair trade\nproducts, to the point of creating a\nbureaucracy to check that we do.\nI\u2019m perfectly happy for him to\npay any price that the suppliers\nand growers agree to, including one\nwhich is above the market value.\nBut before there is a \u201ccampaign for\nincreased consumption of Fairtrade\ngoods\u201d (funded by our infinitely-bounteous Union I suppose), people\nshould be aware of the problems of\nFairtrade.\nWhen buying Fairtrade coffee\nyou are charitably giving to certain selected groups of produc-ers. Selected, that is, by the Fair\nLabeling Organisation, which charges $2431 plus $607/year plus $1 per\n110 pounds of coffee sold to be certified as a Fair Trade producer. And\nif you\u2019re a small producer (that is,\nless than 44,000 pounds of coffee per\nyear \u2013 $55,440 per year, by FairTrade\nbase prices) then I\u2019m afraid that\nthe FLO \u201cseldom\u201d certifies groups\nso small [Simen Sandberg, quoted\nin The Christian Science Monitor,\nApril 13th].\nThe problem with the primary\nFairtrade produce, coffee, is that\ntoo much of it is being produced\nworldwide. In Brazil and Columbia,\nproducers were encouraged to\nswitch from cocaine to coffee. In an\neffort to rebuild Vietnam, aid went\ninto setting up coffee plantations so\nthat the farmers could be self-suf-ficient. This led to an over-supply of\ncoffee.\nThe average coffee production per\nyear increased 28% from 1990 to\n2002 [ICO figures], but the values\njump wildly \u2013 not the sign of a stable market. All this over-supply, of\ncourse, caused the price to drop\nand the less efficient producers to\nsuffer. The inefficient producers in\nthis case were the small, primitive\nfarmers who Fairtrade is supposed\nto help.\nBut Fairtrade gives the efficient\nproducers less incentive to cut\ncosts and keeps those farmers forever at the mercy of the charity of\nthose who buy Fairtrade and of the\nFLO, which soon gains the power\nto select who will and who won\u2019t\nsurvive.\nInstead of this Jamie, perhaps\nwe should be lobbying for the elimination of EU subsidies such as\nthe Common Agricultural Policy\n(though not through the Union of\ncourse, because everyone agrees\nthat the Union should limit itself to\nthose issues which affect students\nas students, don\u2019t they?)\nThe idiotic effects of the CAP\nhave entered into common usage:\n\u201cbutter mountains\u201d, \u201cwine lakes\u201d\netc. In 2001, 7m tonnes of sugar\nwas exported [Oxfam, 2002] from\nthe EU, and the EU taxpayer paid\na total of $2.1bn to subsidise this\ndumping on the world markets.\nThe development of internal trade\n(especially within Africa) and the\ncessation of dumping under-priced\ngoods on the world market is the\nway to help these farmers. Hitching\nthem to our charity, which is supported only by the public\u2019s wondering attention, is not.\nUnfair trade?\nAdam Langley responds to last week\u2019s Comment article on Fairtrade products\nCoffee: \u201ctoo much of it is being produced worldwide\u201d\n\n"

And no, I am not\ntalking about the expenditure\n(which has already begun to\nhit home for me) nor the prospect of being ogled by overzealous relatives. Rather,\nit is the weather that plays\nthe villain in the end of year\nChristmas pantomime.\nFour per cent of over-40s\nof both sexes suffer from\nCOPD \u2013 Chronic Obstructive\nPulmonary Disease \u2013 a\ndisease that can affect the\nbreathing processes of the\nsufferer, leading to some catastrophic symptoms. Fatality\nis a very real possibility,\neven for sufferers who are\nadmitted to hospital for treat-ment. Shortness of breath,\nincreased sputum purulence,\na common cold and wheezing\nare the most common symptoms associated with the ail-ment.\nThe statistics are stagger-ing. Of those who suffer from\ndegradations in their condition (these degradations are\ncalled exacerbations), about\n20% are admitted to hospital.\nOf those, 15% of admittances\nresult in mortality within 90\ndays. Those who survive cannot be considered safe either\n\u2013 27% were readmitted within 90 days having suffered\nanother exacerbation.\nThe drain this has on the\nNHS is astronomical. I was\nleft speechless by the scale\nof the problem. Each year,\nCOPD contributes to in the\nregion of one million bed days\n(and 23% of all respiratory\nbed days), costing the NHS\nabout \u00a3600m. COPD alone\nis responsible for 12% of all\nemergency medical admis-sions. The aforementioned\nexacerbations cost up to 45%\nof the total cost to the NHS\ncaused by COPD \u2013 about \u00a3270\nmillion.\nThere is, however, a prospect that has the potential\nto alleviate some of the burden that this problem exerts.\nA pilot scheme is to be run\nnext year in the South-West\nPeninsula Primary Care\nTrust of the NHS. The aim is\nto use weather forecasts to\npredict when the frequency\nof exacerbations of the condition of COPD sufferers will be\nat greater incidence. This will\nallow the NHS to prioritise\nthe COPD problem and allow\nit to be better prepared to\ncope with a greater incidence\nof admittances of COPD suf-ferers.\nThe new method of treating\nCOPD, being spearheaded by\nthe pilot scheme, is to identify\nthe level of sufferer that is at\nsignificant risk, using weather forecasts to help with this\nidentification. Weather conditions that increase the\nnumber of exacerbations are\nessentially cold tempera-tures. These are associated\nwith viral infections which\nmay precipitate the exacer-bations and also cause physiological reactions \u2013 such as\nvasoconstriction reducing\nblood flow to the lungs in preference for the other organs to\nreduce heat loss \u2013 which can\nhave derogatory effects on\ncondition. Similarly, air pollution can be responsible for\nexacerbation, hence causing\na greater risk to city COPD\nsufferers.\nCOPD affects different\npeople to different degrees.\nPatients are stratified\naccording to their level of\nsusceptance to exacerba-tions. Those in the \u201cFrequent\nAdmission Group\u201d, who have\nbeen admitted to hospital\nthree or more times in the\nlast 12 months, are regarded\nas being those who are at\ngreatest risk of further exac-erbation. There are five strata levels of patients according\nto risk.\nThe forecast is issued twice\nweekly, and it identifies those\nwho might be at risk. For\nexample, a forecast of \u201cVery\nHigh Activity\u201d would cause\nevery COPD sufferer to be\ncontacted to be warned of the\nrisk and the suggestion of preventative measures be made.\nPlans are made to ensure\nthat staff can cope with the\nexpected increase in admis-sions, and so that they are\nmore ruthless in discharging those with lower risk so\npatients who are at greater\nrisk can benefit from more\nimmediate treatment.\nThe crux of the scheme is to\ntreat many sufferers at home\nto reduce hospital admis-sions. These home visits by\nnurses and health workers\nare safe and effective, an\nalternative way of managing patients who suffer from\nexacerbations who would\notherwise need to be admitted to, and possibly have to\nstay in, hospital. Antibiotics\ncan be used to treat purulent sputum and oral pred-nisolone can be prescribed\nto help alleviate breathing\ndifficulties. Essentially these\nvisits will allow the patient to\nbe treated in an environment\nthat they find more comfort-able, and will reduce admit-tances to hospital of people\nwho may need to stay and\nsubsequently occupy beds.\nIn the current hospital situa-tion, in which beds seem to be\npermanently in shortage, this\ncan help patients who suffer\nfrom other ailments and who\ncategorically need to be in\nhospital for treatment to find\nthe bed they need.\nThe reduction in cost will\nalso liberate much funding\nfor the NHS to invest in other\nareas. In the South-West\nPeninsula PCT alone, in 2002\nCOPD cost the NHS nearly\n\u00a315 million, using up 52608\nbed days, as there were 239\nadmissions per 100,000. The\nmost optimistic estimation is\nthat these in-house consultations will reduce admission\nrates by up to 40%, saving\n\u00a36m and 21043 bed days in\nthis PCT alone.\nThe medical staff will be\nsent out to someone\u2019s home\nfollowing an emergency\ncall of someone suffering\nfrom an exacerbation. Once\nat the patient\u2019s home, it is\nthen decided if the patient\nrequires admittance to hospital according to the seriousness of their condition. For\nexample, if they are severely\nbreathless with impaired consciousness and a deteriorating condition, then the patient\nwould be admitted. If the condition is not immediately seri-ous, then in house treatment\nwould be carried out and the\npatient be left at home with\nguidelines and prescriptions.\nEssentially this appears to\nbe a very convenient arrange-ment. However, there are\ncertain aspects that I would\nquestion. Firstly there is the\nidea of money. The cost of\nthe in-house treatment will\nstill be high, and at times\nof low incidence of exacer-bations this might seem to\nbe an unnecessary fee. Yet\nit is, in my opinion, more a\nquestion of the number of bed\ndays that are freed as a result\nof the in house treatment,\nwhich would undoubtedly\nbe reduced and allow other\npatients to find beds more\neasily. This conceivably has\nknock-on effects of reducing\nwaiting times in Accident and\nEmergency, for example.\nYet further problems\nremain. For example, the\ncondition of the patient may\nexacerbate further after the\nmedical staff or what have\nyou have left the patient at\nhome. What if this further\nexacerbation causes a serious degradation in the condition of the patient? Then\nthere would be another\ntime delay before they could\nreceive medical assistance.\nAlso what if patients were\ndischarged from hospital too\nsoon during a time of \u201cVery\nHigh Activity\u201d, and their condition worsens?\nSimilarly, what if the Met\nOffice Predictions are wrong?\nWeather predictions can be\nnotoriously unreliable. What\nif the weather conditions\nwhich cause exacerbations\noccur without prediction? The\nNHS would then be unprepared for the greater than\nexpected COPD related prob-lems, which may reduce the\neffectiveness of the in house\nscheme \u2013 what if there are\nnot enough medical teams to\ngo around?\nUltimately,thispilotscheme\nhas the potential to become a\nhuge success in despite of\nthese problems. The benefits of a successful pilot are\nthere for all to see, and for\nmany to benefit from. At a\ntime when the NHS is going\nto great lengths to increase\nefficiency, this seems to be\nanother brick in the wall.\nYet the problems will need\nto be addressed. Teething\nproblems are to be expected,\nbut by next Christmas they\nshould have been ironed out.\nIf not, then there will be many\nwho suffer during this time of\nmerriment.\nThe weather forecasts that will save lives\nWilliam Gates explains how the NHS is planning to use weather\nforecasts to save hospital beds and lives\nChristmas may be the season to be jolly, but for many people forecasting cold weather\ncould mean the the difference between life and death\nCOPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonery Disease) is\ncharacterised by abnormalities in the lungs that make it\ndifficult to exhale normally\n\u201cThe reduction in cost\nwill also liberate much\nfunding for the NHS to\ninvest in other areas\u201d\n\n"

Agitated figures\nscurry around aimlessly through\nan intricate maze of Victorian and\nBrutalist architecture. Meanwhile,\na meek middle-aged suit with a\nbig interest in biotechnology peers\ndown from the top of an anachronistic monolith provided by a set of\nmysterious benefactors. And down\nbelow a group of renegade physicists are plotting their next strike\nagainst the system. Sound famil-iar? It will do, once you\u2019ve played\nthrough the long-awaited awaited\nsequel to 1998\u2019s game of the year!\nYes, Half Life 2 has finally become\na reality, after last year\u2019s great controversy surrounding the leak of\nfiles by a German hacker.\nExactly six years ago, the world\nwoke up to the sound of a crowbar\nmeeting flesh, and now ex-Microsoft\nemployees Valve Software, or\nto be precise, the strange entity\nknown widely as the G-man, has\nbrought Gordon Freeman back to\na leaner, meaner world. Those who\nhave already played through City\n17 will know that Valve have taken\nno chances with piracy, infuriating\nsome users by forcing them to wait\nseveral hours before the game could\nbe authenticated by Steam, Valve\u2019s\nown built-in software. This Windows\nXP style system is seen by some as\na shift to the future in games like\nHL2\u2019s DVD-only retail release, forcing those who hadn\u2019t to go out and\nbuy DVD drives.\nSo, to those who haven\u2019t bought\nHalf Life 2, a word of advice. Do. The\noriginal game came out at a time\nwhen people were bitching between\nQuake II and Unreal. It managed to\nblow away both of them, and even\nthough the actual multiplayer component was largely forgotten, the\nsupport that Valve gave to budding\ndevelopers helped produce mods\nlike Counterstrike, which arguably\nbecame more famous than Half Life\nitself. Furthermore, Half Life was\nrevolutionary in its scope and Marc\nLaidlaw\u2019s B-movie plot certainly\nmakes it all the more memorable\nnow, which is why the makers have\nexpanded Dr Freeman\u2019s journey\ninto a whole universe... or two!\nThe game begins as the first one\nended, on a train. But this is a very\ndifferent kettle of fish to the Black\nMesa research facility. City 17 is\na fictional eastern European city,\nunder the control of a mysterious\nforce called the Combine that has\nruled earth since the seven hour\nwar. You soon find out that everyone\nhas heard of your name, and you\nare now revered by your allies and\nfeared by your enemies. But that\ndoesn\u2019t stop them from trying to\nkill you! And so the carnage begins.\nWhereas there has been a growth\nin role-playing shooters like Deus\nEx in the time since Nihilanth was\ndefeated, Half Life 2 encourages a\nless stealthy approach than its pred-ecessor, and instead we are now\nconfronted by horde upon horde of\nzombies, cyborgs, ant-lions and flying buzz-saws!\nJust as this epic is building on\nyears of gaming greatness, it plays\nlike a truly interactive movie through\nfantastic backdrops. It takes you\nfrom the sordid ghettos and canal\nchases of City 17, to zombie flicks\nin Ravenholm, to post-apocalyptic\nthrillers and creature features along\nhighway 17, to Normandy beaches\nand prison dramas in Nova Prospekt,\nback to urban warfare and finally\ninto the evil citadel itself, where it\u2019s\nas if the Borg assimilated the Earth\nof 2199 with the Death Star!\nWith all this evil trying to put an\nend to Gordon again, it\u2019s refreshing\nthat there is now an array of friendly\ncharacters there to help you along,\nincluding the crazy Father Grigory,\nwho bestows you with the Zeropoint energy device, also known as\nthe manipulator or gravity-gun. The\nfun that can be had with this tool is\nlimited only by your imagination, as\nit lets you pick up and launch large\nobjects around the place, thanks to\nthe otherwise ultra-realistic physics courtesy of the Havok engine.\nThe other weapons in your standard arsenal haven\u2019t changed greatly\nfrom the first game, although they\nare better than ever.\nPeople who want an intellectual challenge will be disappointed\nas HL2 pays homage to the glory\ndays of arcade gaming, delivering\nextremely addictive gameplay in\ngorgeous realism that requires the\nintelligence of a Headcrab rather\nthan the PhD that Gordon never has\na chance to put to use. The game\u2019s\nlinearity allows for some beautifully\nchoreographed set-pieces while\nnever disembodying the player from\nthe ever-mute Free-Man.\nThe makers have remembered\nthat game-play shouldn\u2019t be blinded\nby shiny graphics or drowned by\nimmersion into an overly complicated environment as they have\nstrived to uphold the players\u2019 right\nto have fun. In effect, the game\u2019s\nadherence to primitive narration\nand a rich narrative create all the\nsuspense that is needed to drag\nthe player through the game and to\nthe conclusion that HL3 is all but a\nformality.\nAs a final note, Half Life 2 is available either in the shops or through\nSteam as several different pack-ages. Counterstrike Source, rendered as HL2, comes as standard\nwhilst Half Life Source, the original\ngame re-mastered plus a whole load\nof extra bumf, is available for extra\nthrough Steam. An X-Box release\nis planned for next spring, giving\nthe game a wider audience through\nthe console market, although the\nPC version has been on monitor\nscreens since November 16 and will\nprobably be so in various forms for\na long time to come!\nAlex McKitrick\nGames Editor\nHalf Life 2\nValve Software\nPublished by VU Games\nCertificate: 15\nHHHHH\n\u201cHorde upon horde\nof zombies, cyborgs,\nant lions...\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the Borg\nassimilated the Earth\nof 2199 with the\nDeath Star!\u201d\nIt\u2019s time to run for your life. STRIIIIIIIIIIDER!!!\nTeams, players, egos... the entire game on your PC\nHaving played every version of the\npopular PC game Championship\nManager, I was weary when the fol-low-up to last year\u2019s primary cause\nof missed lectures and near exam\nfailure was announced.\nWith a new name, Football\nManager 2005, the series formerly\nknown as Championship Manager\nwas to be avoided at all costs. Yet\nafter receiving a review copy of the\ngame, I relented. And since then,\nI haven\u2019t stopped. Or gone to lec-tures.\nFor those of you with lives, ignorant of this plague on the country\u2019s\nmenfolk, FM 2005 is surprisingly\nenough a football management sim-ulation, allowing you to take control\nof your choice of over 5000 teams\nfrom over 50 countries. There are no\nfancy graphics, just more statistics\nthan a John Motson wet dream. As\na result, anyone who reckons they\ncould do better than Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\n(at winning, not being a smug bas-tard) will become instantly addicted,\nruining relationships and careers\nand, quite possibly, threatening global security.\nHaving only a week to review the\ngame (including lectures) and fancying more fun than losing every\nweek as manager of Wycombe\nWanderers, I plumped for the choice\nof controlling Chelsea. As my managerial alter-ego Jeremy Beadle\nworked his way through a season\nof Premiership football, I slipped\nfurther and further into the depths\nof addiction. My usual routine was to\neschew food and sunlight in favour\nof sitting in front of the computer for\nhours on end. Whilst my team were\nbusy eking out poor results and I\nwas becoming less popular with the\nfans, I contented myself with finding\nhumour in the game\u2019s little quirks.\nFor instance, using the new media\ninteraction feature, you can inform\nthe media of your opinions on other\nmanagers and teams, thus starting\nmind games \u00e0 la Sir Alex Ferguson.\nWhilst being an innovative addition to the game, it also throws\nup some oddities \u2013 my housemates\nand I were amused to read the litany of homoerotic correspondence\nbetween Beadle and Birmingham\nCity manager Steve Bruce, each taking turns to compliment the other in\nwhat seemed to be a blossoming\nrelationship.\nFor non-football lovers, FM 2005\nprobably represents the nadir of\ngaming pleasure, an endless display\nof useless statistics across a muted,\nSpartan background. But for fans of\nthis series, and anyone with a love\nof football, the lure of taking over\none of the many teams from the\ncolossal database is too attractive.\nAs is the prospect of unearthing\nsuch gems as my personal favourite,\nthe spectacularly-named TJ McloryCuthbertson.\nWith quicker loading times and\nextra detail, FM 2005 is certainly\nanother giant leap in the evolution\nof the series. But for God\u2019s sake, if\nyou want to come out of university\nwith a degree, steer well clear of\nthis game...\nTim Hoult\nFootball Manager 2005\nSports Interactive\nHHHHH\nIt doesn\u2019t look like much, but it\u2019s what footie geeks always dreamed of\n\u201cMore statistics than\na John Motson wet\ndream\u201d\n\u201cMy usual routine\nwas to eschew food\nand sunlight in\nfavour of sitting in\nfront of the computer\nfor hours on end...\u201d\n\n"

It was going to\nbe a wrench, but bear in mind I\u2019m\n27, and the time is going to come for\nall of us. Anyway, I went to this exact\nsame event in the exact same venue\nback in March, and Paul van Dyk\nwas so frantically awesome, I joyfully ditched the idea of retirement\nand here I still am today.\nSo, I was expecting great things\nfrom Friday, and indeed there\u2019s\nnothing quite like arriving at Heaven\nto bring you to an absolute pitch of\nfeverish excitement \u2013 the sweep of\nthe road down the side of the sta-tion, the steps down to the tunnel,\nthe orange glow of the lights, queues\nof that unmistakable breed \u2013 club-bers, in their sexy trousers with zips\nup the side and trainers and funky\nt-shirts, clutching their tickets in\nhot little hands, the bouncers, the\nmetal detectors, and overall, that\ndeep bass thump that you can hear\nand feel in the pit of your stomach.\nOooh... clubbing anyone?\nNick Riley warmed up for PvD,\nand played a surprisingly low-paced\nset \u2013 sort of a proggy deep house\nrather than trance. Still, he played\nsome ace tracks \u2013 Tilt\u2019s The World\nDoesn\u2019t Know, and the brilliantly\nurgent Jump The Next Train by\nYoung Parisians.\nAnd then, the time had come \u2013\n1am, the start of PvD\u2019s set, and\nthat undeniably emotional, glorious\nsound. I crept forward to the front\nto make sure it was him, and there\u2019s\nan undeniable thrill in seeing that\ndeadpan face that\u2019s looked out at\nyou from so many record sleeves\nand CD cases. It was less of an\nuplifting and euphoric set than I\nwould have expected \u2013 more uncom-promising, with a definite tech influ-ence, but nothing wrong with that.\nThere were plenty of big tunes as\nwell, like Sander van Doorn\u2019s Dark\nRoast, and many, many of his own\n\u2013 For An Angel, Wir Sind Wir, Time\nOf Our Lives, and Crush \u2013 and this\nis kind of when the trouble started.\nI recognised almost everything I\nheard him play, and I didn\u2019t hear\nanything I didn\u2019t know that I desperately wanted to find out about.\nHe played Space Brothers\u2019 One\nMore Chance, for heaven\u2019s sake,\nwhich is positively ancient and, I\u2019m\nsad to say, in my opinion a tiny bit\ncheesy. Paul just seemed to have\ngiven himself a bit of an easy ride. I\nstill love the man to bits but it really\nwon\u2019t do. I don\u2019t know, perhaps he\nwas ill, or having a bad day, but if\nyou\u2019re performing, you\u2019re going to\nbe judged. I even wondered cynically if Nick Riley had deliberately\n(or been instructed to) played at a\nslower pace to make it easier for\nPvD. Towards the end there was a\nbit of the old magic. He finished off\nhis set with a mix of Jump The Next\nTrain, nice and acoustic through the\nvocals and then off like an express\ntrain, with everyone leaping about\nlike lunatics.\nI have to say the place did look\nextremely nice though \u2013 a big\nsparkly silver Gatecrasher lion up\non the wall and a huge, enthusiastic\ncrowd. What makes it such a shame\nis that PvD and Gatecrasher do\nhave this colossal number of loyal\nfollowers that will hand over their\nhard-earned 15 quid (or \u00a322 on the\ndoor) and come anyway. Surely they\ndeserve better. It\u2019s sad to rely on the\nold faces and brand recognition.\nLet\u2019s hope that the great man\nwas simply having an off day and\nwe can put this behind us. I\u2019ll still\ndefinitely go next time and I\u2019ll be\nas excited as I was this time. On\na brighter note, the next couple of\nmonths are looking to continue the\nrun of quality events that we\u2019ve been\nspoiled with this year: Lange, Smith\n& Pledger and Simon Patterson at\nTranceGeneration, Matt Darey\u2019s\nDecadealbumlaunchatDecember\u2019s\nKnowwhere, Massive @ Heaven,\nLashed, and brand new trance night\nUltra Utopia in January.

There has been so\nmuch press about the inadequacies of wind energy as\na power supply that a general feeling of negativity and\ndoubt has descended over\nthis renewable option.\nIt is fairly easy to jump\non the \u2018wind = bad\u2019 band\nwagon, what with turbines\nreaching 260 feet into the sky\nand being erected in tranquil\nrural settings. David Thomas\nof the Mail on Sunday suggests that townies (the likes\nof Imperial dwellers) should\nquit diverting our environmental guilt into schemes\nthat the rural communities\nare being made to suffer. Mr\nThomas suggests that there\nis no evidence that wind\nfarms have any real benefits.\nHere I have to disagree,\nand argue that the concern\nshould be with lack of take-up.\nTownies\u2019 schemes are taking\nplace in the countryside as\nthat is where there is space\navailable. I\u2019m positive that\nfew in the city would mind\nhaving a turbine attached to\nthe roof of their office block\nor home if that were pos-sible!\nIn 1991, the US Department\nof Energy published a\nNational Wind Resource\nInventory in which it pointed out that between them,\nKansas, North Dakota and\nTexas have enough harness-able wind power to serve the\nnational electricity require-ments. This detail was written over a decade ago, when\nturbines were a meagre 120\nfeet. The modern, taller, turbines operate at lower speeds\nmore efficiently and are able\nto harness more reliable and\nlarger wind regimes at higher levels.\nEurope is the wind energy\nworld leader, but the UK still\nseems reluctant to embrace\nits potential. Last year, the\nEuropean Wind Energy\nAssociation projected that by\n2020 half the population of\nWestern Europe\u2019s electricity would be provide by wind\nenergy. If the offshore potential was utilised, it could\nprovide all of the region\u2019s\nresidential electricity by the\nsame time according to a 2004\nassessment by the Gerrad\nHassan consulting group.\nThe cost of wind-generated\nelectricity has fallen with the\nkilowatt hour cost to its lowest ever, down by a factor of\nten to 3\u00a2 on some long supply\nUS contracts. So wind power\nis now cheap, widely avail-able, clean and in abundance\n\u2013 and the weakness of irregularity is being overcome by\nusing taller turbines and utilising the National grid.\nGas-electric hybrid cars,\nsuch as the Toyota Prius,\ncould also exploit wind\nresources. They drive 55\nmiles to the gallon and Lester\nBrown of the Earth Policy\nInstitute in Washington suggests that adding a second\nbattery and a plug-in capacity could increase their electricity storage ability. This\nwould further reduce their\ngas intake another 20%, giving an overall cutback of 70%.\nThe plug-in hybrids could\nbecome part of the storage\nsystem for wind energy.\nThere are still, according\nto Peter Odell, Professor\nEmeritus at Erasmus\nUniversity Rotterdam,\nenough oil reserves remaining to be exploited to meet\ncurrent demand for another\n40 years. Some of the exploitation methods will have to\nchange, but these are technologically possible. Demand\nfor energy is going to continue to rise steadily as it has\nbeen at 2% per year for the\nlast 30 years \u2013 and after all\nthe oil has been exploited,\ncarbon could still be king\nwith coal and then natural\ngas to dominate the global\nenergy picture.\nFor wind to rule, the\nGovernment and policy-mak-ers worldwide must show\neven more commitment to\nthe principle of renewable\nenergy, raise taxes on carbon\nfuels and subsidise the development of alternative power\nharnessing.\nMy biased townie view is\nthat is would be best to make\nwind king, the sooner the better all round.\nSurely wind energy is the perfect solution\nWind farming: the cost has fallen to its lowest ever\nDifferent operating systems, different needs\nBy Amadeus Stevenson\nPhysics department\nWhen you buy a compu-ter, chances are it\u2019s a PC,\nor to put it simply, it\u2019s running Microsoft Windows. You\nmight even think that the definition of a home computer\nis a thing with a \u201cStart\u201d button that crashes during your\nlab report write-up. However,\nthere\u2019s a lot more out there in\ncomputer never-never-land.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in previous\narticles, the operating system\non a computer is the software\n(written in a programming\nlanguage as source code)\nwhich interfaces between\nyou, the user, and the electronic hardware inside your\ncomputer. You want to play\nCher\u2019s Greatest Hits? Your\noperating system will contain\nsoftware to read the MP3 and\nsend the audio data in a form\nwhich your sound card will\nunderstand, through to your\nspeakers. Your whole end\nuser computer experience is\nbased around your operating\nsystem, and there is fierce\nrivalry from different camps\nas to which operating system\nis the best. This week I\u2019ll try\nto give you an idea about the\nmain alternatives, and whether they\u2019re suited to what you\nwant to do. It\u2019s important to\nkeep in mind the idiom: if it\nain\u2019t broke, why fix it?\nPros\nFree, open source so generally better security. Quite\na large user base so lots of\nsoftware available for free\n\u2013 alternatives to Microsoft\nOffice are available, as well\nas all the tools you\u2019d need for\ngraphics, audio, maths and\neven games. Some distributions are easy to install and\nuse \u2013 trying to emulate the\nWindows ease of use factor.\nMake great web/email serv-ers. Will run fine on older\nmachines which might not be\nable to cope with the requirements of Windows. Users\ntend to be enthusastic so\nthere\u2019s lots of support (see\nImperial Linux User group).\nCons\nWon\u2019t have all the hardware support that Windows\nhas, although manufacturers are clueing up to the\ngrowing use of Linux \u2013 you\nonly have to check the system requirements list on\nmany computer items to\nsee Linux listed underneath\nWindows and Mac. Can be a\nvery large pain in the arse\nwhen you can\u2019t find drivers for your printer and the\nmonitor refuses to show in\nhigh resolution; not to mention the modem is unsupported and requires chang-ing. Depending on your\ndistribution, may require\ncopious amounts of writing\ncommands on a black background to get the mouse\nworking etc.\nConclusion\nCoding boffin? Get Linux on\nan old PC and you\u2019ll be tinkering for hours.\nPros\nEasy to use. Once installed\nand set up, which is fairly\npainless to do in most cir-cumstances, it\u2019s easy for people of almost any technical\nbackground to be able to surf\nthe internet, write an email\nor letter and print it out after-wards. You can even print\nenvelopes without too much\ndifficulty. Being by far the\nmost widely used operating\nsystem for home PC users,\nit has an enormously large\nchoice of software, including\ngames. For the same reason,\nhardwaremanufacturerswho\nmake graphics cards, sound\ncards and all the bit and bobs\nyou could want to use on your\ncomputer have this market in\nmind when producing items\n\u2013 so all of them will work on\nWindows (well, they\u2019re supposed to).\nCons\nHas the largest number of\nexploits, viruses and worms\nof any of the operating systems listed here \u2013 partly due\nto its popularity, but also due\nto poor security. As many a\ndisgruntled user will know,\ncrashes can be frequent, and\nfrequently reinstalling can\nbe required. Tends to eat\nup system resources and is\ncommercial software, so the\ninner workings are protected by Microsoft. This is the\nopposite philosophy of \u201copen\nsource\u201d software, which\nreleases its source code to\nthe community. This way you\ndon\u2019t know how the software\nis written, and hence can\u2019t fix\nbugs easily or reliably. Also\nchanging system settings can\nbe tiresome, and sometimes\nyou don\u2019t know what the\nmachine is really doing.\nConclusion\nStandard essay writing/gen-eral school use? Get yourself\na relatively cheap PC with\nWindows.\nPros\nExtremely lightweight,\nnot at all heavy on system\nresources. Very secure,\nhas least amount of serious\nbugs. Generally good hardware support. Superb serv-ers. NetBSD, one particular\ntype of BSD, has been ported\nor transferred to run on an\nincredible range of computer architectures (over 50)\nincluding Playstation 2 and\nDreamcast. As with Linux,\nif you want to change something on your system, such\nas your IP address or what\nsystem services you have,\nyou\u2019ll just have to edit one\nor two files with a command\nline editor and you\u2019re done!\nCons\nIt\u2019s not GUI. Well not until\nyou\u2019ve installed it, the X\nWindow graphical system,\nneeding to know the synchronization frequencies\nof your monitor, got your\nmouse working, installed a\nwindow manager, installed\nlinux emulation, java under\nlinux emulation, then a bloated office package to make\nyour powerpoint presentations at the risk of grinding\nyour computer to a halt. It\u2019s\nnot ideal for game playing,\nalthough there are a few 3D\ngames available, but BSD\nbased machines make great\nservers.\nConclusion\nCoding boffin: this is the\nOS for you. Others needn\u2019t\napply.\nThere are 3 main types\nof BSD, all derived\nfrom Berkeley Software\nDistribution, a split from\nUNIX System V. It\u2019s open\nsource like Linux and\nhas many similarities.\nPros\nIt\u2019s really pretty. I mean real-ly. Very easy to use, less complicated than any of the other\noperating systems. Stunning\ngraphics, a great range of\nsoftware and major games\nare available. With Apple,\ndesign is everything, and this\nis true for their operating\nsystem. It\u2019s uncluttered, easy\nand straightforward to use\nso there\u2019s less to confuse a\nnovice user.\nCons\nExpensive. Very expensive.\nYou\u2019re looking upwards of\n\u00a31000 for a desktop, but you\nget what you pay for.\nConclusion\nGraphic design? Mac\u2019s your\nbest option, but a good PC\nwith Windows will have the\ndesigning software you need.\nUnlike the other operating systems listed, MacOS X only runs on Apple\u2019s computer systems. This means to use it you have to buy their systems, which are\nexpensive. Their latest operating system is based on a BSD kernel, and has\nconverted many users by its beauty and the fact that it works smoothly.\nAccording to market reports, Microsoft\u2019s operating systems are used on\nover 90% of home users\u2019 computers. The latest version is Windows XP\nwhich in most cases you\u2019ll be using around college and will have pre-installed on any new computer you buy.\nLinux is the name of the kernel, or central part, of a free operating system\ndeveloped from 1991 by Linus Torvalds and the internet community of open\nsource developers.\n\n"

Together they used to\nbuild cars under the name of\nJames & Browne.\nFor the most part, they were\npretty ordinary. Only two\nJames & Browne cars which\nrolled off the Hammersmith\nproduction line are still in\nexistence, one of which is\nBoanerges (also known as\nBo\u2019), built in 1902.\nBo\u2019 (as many of you may\nknow) is currently owned by\nImperial College and is the\nofficial motorised mascot of\nthe President of the City &\nGuilds College Union. The\nother car lives in Devon,\ncurrently owned by a Mr\nProctor, who inherited it\nfrom his father and grand-father, a former employee of\nthe James & Browne motor\ncompany.\nAs some of the more senior\nmembers of the college may\nremember, there were big celebrations to mark Bo\u2019s centenary at the National Motor\nHeritage Museum, in Gaydon.\nAs these were attended by\nMr Proctor and his James &\nBrowne, it seemed only fitting\nthat, on the occasion of his\ncar\u2019s centenary, a delegation\nfrom Imperial should go and\npay him a visit in Devon. And\nso the adventure began...\nA week after the ordeal\nof the summer term, the\ndevoted members of Team\nBo\u2019 returned to College and\nbegan preparing the City &\nGuilds mascot for another\nlong journey. We decided to\nload Bo\u2019 onto a trailer for the\ntrip down to Dartmoor, as he\nwasn\u2019t designed to face the\nFriday morning rush hour.\nAfter squeezing every tool in\nthe entire garage into a union\nminibus and hitching up the\ntrailer, complete with car, we\nset off for Devon.\nUnfortunately, team member Dave had not made it\nto the garage by the time of\nour departure, but we set off\nanyway. This worked out for\nthe best, as we were able to\ndivert Dave as he raced to\ncatch up with us. We sent him\nto collect a large quantity of\nalcohol, which came in handy\nfor the weekend.\nNewly qualified towing-Jedi Dan Lehmann drove the\nminibus plus trailer through\nthe traffic and torrential rain,\nwhilst most of the team slept\nlike babies in the back. After a\nquickstopforessentialre-fuel-ling (BK Whopper Burgers all\nround), we arrived at a random Little Chef and decanted\nBo\u2019 from the trailer. It took\nabout an hour to secure the\nexhaust pipes, which had fallen off the day before during a\nparticularly energetic tuning\nrun down Kensington Church\nStreet.\nWe cruised for a couple of\nlaps of RNAS Yeovilton and\nposed for photos of Bo\u2019 next\nto a Harrier jump jet. Just as\nwe were getting close to flying\n(on four wheels) down proper\ncountry lanes, the gear selection mechanism imploded\nduring a three point turn.\nDriver James (in his dubious\nwisdom) decided that it could\nbe more thoroughly fixed if\nthe linkage was totally dismantled by the roadside. As\nsoon as it had been stripped\nfrom the car and split into a\nlarge number of delicate looking pieces, it started to rain.\n40 very wet minutes later,\nJames had managed to put\nthe linkage back together.\nWhen Bo\u2019 was back in running order, the rain immediately stopped and we drove on\ntowards the \u2018campsite\u2019. This\njust happened to be the front\ngarden of a friendly family in\nthe village of Curry Rivel. To\nbe more precise, the family\nwere in fact the current residents of a house which had\nbeen inhabited by the original\nowner of the 1904 car. Team\nBo\u2019 pitched a couple of tents\n(one for Bo\u2019 and one for us),\nbefore departing on the bus\nfor the village of Longport.\nWe spent the evening enjoying hospitality of local public\nhouses, before posing for a\nphoto outside of the amusingly named Longport Tackle\nShop and returning to our\nadopted front garden for\nsome after-hours port drink-ing.\nSoon the sun was rising over the rolling hills of\nDevon. Bo\u2019 was wheeled out\nof the tent and given an allover polish. Special mention\nshould go to the expert polishing skills demonstrated by\nSimon. Dan Lehmann even\ngot out a special white marker pen to write \u2018Dunlop\u2019 down\nthe side of Bo\u2019s tyres, much to\nthe amusement of everyone\nelse. At about this point, Mr\nProctor arrived in his James\n& Browne, which for some\nreason is much quieter than\nBo\u2019, but we still heard him\ncoming.\nA fair number of Team Bo\u2019\nwere still nursing sore heads\nfrom the night before, but\nBo\u2019 was looking fantastically\nshiny, all just in time for a\nphotographer from the local\nnewspaper to turn up. Guilds\nregalia at the ready, we posed\nfor several photos with both\ncars parked side by side,\nbefore driving up and down\nthe nearest country lane,\nattempting to run the photographer over as he took pictures of us heading straight\ntowards him. He insisted on\nstanding in the middle of the\nroad, only to leap head first\ninto the Hawthorne hedgerow each time we got close.\nBo\u2019 soon tired of posing\nfor photos. The gear selection mechanism promptly\nimploded once again. This\ntime James just realigned\nthe linkage, rather than going\nthrough the totally unnecessary process of taking the\nwhole thing apart.\nIn the afternoon, we drove\nthe two James & Browne cars\ndown into the centre of Curry\nRivel for their annual village\nf\u00eate. Initially we were given\na parking space on the vicar\u2019s immaculate newly concreted driveway. After about\n40 minutes, Bo\u2019 had left his\noily mark on the floor, so we\ndecided to move up towards\nthe village green before our\noil leaks got us into trouble\nwith the clergy. Having the\nonly two surviving James &\nBrowne cars together for the\nafternoon certainly provided\nan exciting edge to the village\nfair, the other highlights of\nwhich included a tombola and\ntraditional maypole dancing.\nOnce the frivolity of the fair\nhad died down, our accompanying Team Bo\u2019 alumni took\nBo\u2019 out for a quick spin down\nthe village lanes, with Paul\nat the helm, ably assisted by\nPete in the role of co-driver\nand Jez hanging on in the\nback seat. The current students amongst the team\nreturned to our campsite to\nmake themselves presentable\nfor the evening. Mr Proctor\nhad kindly arranged for us to\ndine on the \u2018Dartmoor Belle\u2019,\na special volunteer staffed\nrail service which operates\non the Okehampton Line.\nThis was no ordinary train\n\u2013 we had a whole first class\ncarriage to ourselves and\nenjoyed a sumptuous three\ncourse dinner with lashings\nof wine. Good, clean (genu-inely first class) fun. Even\nthe usually serious Matt was\namused. After dinner, we\nretired to the train\u2019s custom-built function carriage, where\nthe onboard jazz quartet were\nplaying requests and the bar\nwas serving large measures\nof Glen Morangie whiskey.\nBo\u2019 had been safely garaged\nfor the night with Mr Proctor,\nso after the evening\u2019s enter-tainment, Team Bo\u2019 retired\nto the nearby Okehampton\nyouth hostel. Sunday was\nspentaspartofastaticdisplay\nof veteran and classic vehicles at the recently restored\nOkehampton Station. We\nmanaged the occasional lap\nof the car park, in between\nexplaining the car\u2019s history\nto visiting tourists and interested passers-by.\nAt the end of the morning\nsession, we snuck Bo\u2019 off into\na corner of the car park to\ngive Dan Reader, next year\u2019s\nBo\u2019 Driver, a first opportunity\nat the controls. He soon managed to find first gear, and\neventually second as well,\nbefore racing around the car\npark at the breakneck speed\nof 10 miles per hour. After\nthe driving lesson had fin-ished, we parked Bo\u2019 outside\nthe station and disappeared\ninside for lunch.\nUpon returning to inspect\nthe car, we found that honorary Team Bo\u2019 member and\nex-C&G president Shrenik\nPatel was curled up in the\nback seat, fast asleep. As\nthe evening approached, we\nloaded Bo\u2019 back onto the trailer and started on the long\njourney back to College.

    "content": "FILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nYes guys, it\u2019s the time of year when\nwe need to be jolly, forget all our\ntroubles, and brave the clustered\nstreets of central London to get our\nshopping done. It\u2019s also the time\nwhen those Hollywood moguls capi-talise on the season by drowning us\nall with the usual dose of Christmas\nfilms \u2013 some ultimate turkeys and\nothers worthy smash hits. Will director Joe Roth\u2019s latest offering pass\nthe test? Possibly.\nThe unofficial king of Christmas\nblockbusters is back. No, I don\u2019t\nmean the overweight dude in the\nred suit (though he does make a\nsmall role in the film), I mean Tim\nAllen. With Christmas blockbusters like The Santa Claus under his\nbelt, the former Home Improvement\nactor appears alongside an impressive all-star line up in this feel-good\ncomedy.\nAllen stars as Luther Krank, a\ngoofy family man living in a suburban neighbourhood with his wife\nNora (Jamie Lee Curtis) and teenage daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo).\nThe Kranks are famous among their\nneighbourhood for marking the festive season by throwing their usual\nparties, so imagine how mortifying it\nwas to the entire neighbourhood (the\nlocal police force, the local priest, I\nmean everyone) to hear that things\nwould be different this year.\nThat was courtesy of Blair deciding she would spend the festive\nseason with her friends at school,\nrather than with the folks. Quick\nthinking Luther decides it\u2019s time\nto live a little (away from the cold)\nby taking his wife on a Caribbean\ncruise during the Christmas period\ninstead of slaving away preparing\nfor the usual party.\nThe implications: no tree, no\ngifts, no Mr Snowman, but plenty\nof angry neighbours doing all in\ntheir power to make the Kranks feel\nbad. Luther decides to fight back,\nuntil Blair does a U-turn at the last\nminute and decides to come home\nfor Christmas.\nMum and Dad\u2019s holiday plans are\nbust. With only 12 hours left before\nBlair arrives, they must quickly plan\ntheir usual Christmas.\nThis film is typical of Hollywood\u2019s\nfantasy Christmas offerings \u2013 the\nbackground Christmas music, the\ncarol singing neighbours and the\nsnow, to name just a few things.\nThe plot does not appear to be very\npractical in everyday life. It\u2019s very\nlightweight and predictable. This\nfilm will certainly not be shaking\nthe seats of the Oscar bosses. So if\nyou are looking for a film that will\nhave you gripped from beginning to\na month after the end, don\u2019t bother\nwith this one.\nI feel the only element that carries this film is the all-star line up.\nTim Allen is an impressive actor\nand the on-screen chemistry with\nJamie Lee Curtis is undeniable.\nFormer Ghostbusters actor Dan\nAckroyd does well in portraying the\nringleader of the angry neighbours\ndoing their best to stir things up,\ncracking the usual jokes that have\nmade him the actor we all know\nand love.\nHowever, I won\u2019t write off this film\nentirely. There are a number of classic moments to savour. I won\u2019t spoil\nit all for you too much. All I\u2019ll say\nis: botox, Tim Allen, serious fake\ntan, Hickory Ham and a frozen cat.\nThere is also some candy guy in the\nshape of Blair\u2019s Latino boyfriend,\nEnrique.\nAll in all, this is a feel-good comedy\nthat should lift your mood. Ideally\nit\u2019s a good film for your younger\nsiblings, but it\u2019s not worth getting\n\u201ccranked\u201d up about if you miss it.\nGbemisola Ayininuola\nNot as \u2018kranky\u2019 as it sounds\n\u2018Tis the season to be jolly, so here come the usual festive treats. After the bomb of\nSurviving Christmas, Hollywood is looking to redeem itself\nChristmas with the Kranks\nDirector: Joe Roth\nStarring: Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis,\nDan Aykroyd\nLength: 98 minutes\nCertificate: PG\nHHHII\nNow what on earth could go wrong now?\n\u201cThis film will\ncertainly not be\nshaking the seats of\nthe Oscar bosses\u201d\nHistory... Hollywood style. No change there then\nShakespeare isn\u2019t something you\u2019d\nexpect to be made into a film these\ndays \u2013 too many long words I guess\n\u2013 but miraculously this one was\ngreen lighted for production.\nOn paper, this seems an interesting film, with Al Pacino and Jeremy\nIrons delivering amazing perform-ances, and some familiar faces in\nMackenzie Crook (The Office) and\nKris Marshall (My Family). All this\nnot forgetting it was written by one\nof history\u2019s greatest playwrights.\nAl Pacino plays Shylock, a Venetian\nJew who lends money to Antonio\n(Irons). Bear with me here \u2013 Antonio\nisn\u2019t actually borrowing money for\nhimself but for his friend (although\nhe\u2019d like him to be a bit more than\nthat) Bassanio.

To aggravate the situation,\nShylock\u2019s daughter elopes with her\nlover and a sizable chunk of her\nfather\u2019s wealth.\nThe acting can\u2019t be faulted; howev-er, neither can it be praised \u2013 a bit of\na non-event, really \u2013 but Al Pacino\u2019s\nmelancholy presence makes up for\nthis and he dominates the film even\nafter his exit. His portrayal of the\nmoneylender is a sensitive one; he\nis both victim and villain. One of the\nbest scenes is his rendition of the\niconic \u201cIf you prick us, do we not\nbleed?\u201d speech, which is guaranteed\nto make you sit up and pay attention\nin an otherwise slow paced, dull film.\nIrons does well in portraying the\nhomoerotic undertones in Antonio\nand Bassanio\u2019s relationship... but\nsadly that\u2019s all I can think of to sell\nthe film to you.\nRadford could have done much\nmore with the direction, but the\nscenes were poorly shot and loosely\nlinked to each other \u2013 it just didn\u2019t\ngel. The film had the potential to be\nvisually spectacular with Radford\nsticking to the 16th century theme\nand shooting in Venetian locations.\nHowever, what you\u2019re given is something that is quite oppressive and\nugly to look at. It looked as if it were\na substandard B-grade TV movie\nrather than something for the big\nscreen. Perhaps the use of the dark\nand dank canals was a metaphor for\nthe play\u2019s blurred moral world. All\nI can say is that nothing stood out.\nMaybe that\u2019s why I found myself falling asleep during the film. Might I\nadd that this has never happened to\nme before \u2013 I desperately wanted to\nlike The Merchant of Venice, having\nloved reading it in school, but just\ncouldn\u2019t.\nThis film may conjure unhappy\nmemories of GCSE English for\nsome, although it would fill in the\nparts you fell asleep through. What\nwas particularly annoying was\nRadford\u2019s repeated failure to make\nuse of the play as an analogy for\nworld events today which so easily\ncould have been done \u2013 one of the\nmain themes is revenge and oppres-sion. After all, Shylock\u2019s main motivation for terrorising Antonio is the\nappalling treatment he suffered as\na Jew. Radford could have emphasized this, but instead he focuses on\nthe romantic aspect of the play, possibly to satisfy a wider and presumably brainless audience, or to avoid\ncontroversy.\nThe end result? A film that lacks\nany visual style or personality that\nyou may have expected after seeing\nRomeo and Juliet. It\u2019s long \u2013 way too\nlong \u2013 and goes torturously slowly.\nDo not go to see this film if you want\nsomething easy on the mind, as you\nwill need to pay a lot of attention to\nunderstand it. Although Al Pacino\u2019s\nperformance is great, I\u2019d advise you\nall to wait until it\u2019s released on DVD\n\u2013 you won\u2019t be missing out on much.\nHaj Alttahir\nThe Merchant of Venice\nDirector: Michael Radford\nStarring: Lynn Collins, Jeremy Irons,\nAl Pacino, Joseph Fiennes\nLength: 132 minutes\nCertificate: PG\nHHIII\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t \u2018prick\u2019 me again\u201d\n\u201cA film that lacks\nany visual style or\npersonality that you\nmay have expected\nafter seeing Romeo\nand Juliet\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 9 December 2004\n24\n\n"

With a convincing win over UCL, who\nwould have thought that Wye\nhad just gone a month without a match? The team were\non fire and ready to throw\nthemselves at any opposi-tion.\nThe massive score shows\nour complete dominance\nin this game. The amazing\nrucking skills of our forwards\nmade sure we nearly always\nhad the ball, while the flair\nand sheer speed of the backs\ngave the crowd some exhilarating runs.\nEm scored two amazing tries, managing to run\naround all of the opposition,\nobliterating the UCL defence.\nWinger Kipling also added\nsome points to the score,\nwith her storming runs from\nset plays. Her talking on the\npitch was excellent. Gobby\u2019s\nkicking was superb, converting over half of all tries.\nHowever this isn\u2019t to say\nour forwards weren\u2019t excit-ing. Our sweaty Hetty managed to score a flurry of tries,\nall of which would have led\nto Jeremy Guscott leaping\nout of his commentary seat\nwith pure amazement! Liking\nthe netball moves, Hetty was\ndeservedly given player of\nthe match for her fantastic\nfive tries, her solid rucking\nperformance and simply raw\naggression.\nThe scrum was viciously\ncontested at every chance by\nboth teams. But the Wye pack\nlead by hooker Cat was awe-some, turning the ball over\nin the scrum on many occasions through brute force.\nPike\u2019s tackling and mauling\nwas on top form throughout\nthe entire match. Lineouts\nwere also strong with excellent jumping by Spaz and\nZena.\nThe Wye girls did themselves proud. Rugby is a\nteam game, so without the\n100% effort displayed by\nall, the fantastic score of\n78-5 could not have been\nachieved. Kate, Kayleigh and\nAlice braved the opposition\nand the cold to participate in\ntheir first match of the sea-son. Well done girls. There\nwere almost too many tries\nto count. Let\u2019s hope this will\nbe the case in a week\u2019s time\nagainst the Virgins.\nThanks go to our coach,\nthe refereee, the two touch\njudges, all our supporters and\nof course our two cheerlead-ers/water boys. Let\u2019s keep up\nthe winning streak.\nRUGBY\nUCL no match for Wye\nRVC Men\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 0\nBy Michael Nicholson\nThe intrepid Fourths made\nthe trek to deepest darkest\nHertfordshire to face RVC,\nwho had emerged from fortress Harlington with an ill-deserved draw in the previous meeting between the two\nsides.\nDue to the total idiocy of the\nRVC captain, the majority of\nthe Fourths went to the wrong\nground, meaning that at kickoff the sun was already beginning to set. The only option\nwas to play a shortened game\nof thirty minutes each way.\nIt was an unfamiliar side\nthat took to the darkened\npitch, with illness, injury,\nand random trips to Bury\n(Aldridge-Carlos) taking their\ntoll. New signing JJ continued at right back with Toony\nmoving across to the centre\nto partner Shinguards. The\nsurprise choice at left back\nwas Jai, whose place up front\nwas taken by another new\nboy, Danny.\nThe lack of a warm-up led\nto a horrifically scrappy first\nhalf with neither team getting into their stride. The\nmakeshift defence was coping admirably, and Vanni was\nperforming well in a sweeper/\nkeeper role. Chances however were at a premium, and\neven when shooting opportunities did present themselves\nboth sides were strangely\nreluctant to let fly. The only\nreal moment of interest came\nwhen the Mullet got away\nfrom Shinguards after what\nlooked like a blatant push\nand found himself through on\ngoal. However, the veteran\ncentre half showed speed to\nrecover and get the ball away\nwith a well-timed challenge.\nThe second half provided\na lot more in terms of goal-scoring opportunities; unfortunately they all fell to the\nVets. The Mullet twice managed to produce decent shots\nfrom tight angles, and Vanni\nmanaged to make a couple of\noutstanding stops.\nThe game was destined to\nfinish nil-nil until the very last\nmoment, when the Vets got\nthe break of the ball in midfield allowing their winger to\nescape down the right. His\ncross was met by the Mullet\nwhose shot deflected off\nToony right into the path of\ntheir onrushing midfielder,\nwho had no problem finishing\ninto the corner.\nIt was a sickening blow,\nworsened by the referee\u2019s\nwhistle before Imperial could\neven kick off again. I could go\non a rant about how unfair all\nthis was, but I won\u2019t. We\u2019ll just\nwin the Cup instead.\nVets get\nlucky... again\nFOOTBALL\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 4\nSOAS Men\u2019s 1st 1\nBy Chris Jermyn\nOn a crisp Saturday morn-ing, Team Bouncebackability\nmade their way to Fortress\nCobham to take on the School\nof Oriental and African\nStudies.\nIt was clear from the off\nwho the better side was, the\nSeconds passing the ball\naround well with Has and\nEaster dominating the middle and Leigh and DAL flying\ndown the wings. Still, in true\nSecond team tradition, SOAS\nscored first, Geike impersonating a dying penguin by falling over at the back to allow\ntheir centre forward to walk\nthrough and score. The goal\ndidn\u2019t faze us though as it was\nclearly only a matter of time\nbefore our dominance paid\noff, although for all of our possession the score remained\n1-0 at half time.\nThe second half started as\nthe first half ended, with Will\nand Geike solid at the back\nand Kimmo steamrolling his\nway down the wing. After\nten minutes we finally broke\nthrough, Greedy weaving his\nway past their entire team to\nslot the ball past the funboy\n\u2018keeper. The goal settled our\nnerves and apart from a few\nsmart saves from Von Orford\nthere was only going to be\none outcome.\nAfter more pressure,\nGreedy bagged his second,\na Bergkamp-esque flick from\nJermyn putting him through\nto finish coolly. Some neat\ninterplay around the box then\nallowed Garro to turn on a\nsixpence and finish in the bottom corner.\nWith five minutes to go, a\nlong ball from goalkeeper\nOrford and an uncanny Geike\nimpersonation from SOAS\u2019\nHobbit centre back allowed\nJermyn to walk through their\ndefence and roll the ball into\nthe empty net.\nThe Seconds can look forward to a spring term with\nconfidence to ensure a third\nseason in the ULU premier\nleague.\nSeconds first\nat last in ULU\nFOOTBALL\n\n"

    "content": "In January 2005, the Huygens probe will attempt to land on the largest moon in the\nsolar system. What it will find there remains a complete mystery to scientists.\nDavid Osumi-Sutherland reports on the countdown to Titan\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 9 December 2004\n4\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nIt\u2019s raining methane today. A\ndramatic storm is throwing up\nhuge waves of methane that\nlash the ice cliffs. From out of\nthe orange clouds descends\na metal disc suspended from\na large parachute. Inside the\ndisc, sensors hum analyzing\nthe chemical and physical\nproperties of the atmosphere\nwhile cameras record the\ntumult below and the view\nout to the horizon. The disc\napproaches the ocean emitting a pulsing sound, sensors\nalert to echoes from the surface and the ocean\u2019s depths,\nbefore disappearing into the\ncrashing surf.\nBad science fiction?\nPossibly. But it\u2019s also a plausible scenario for the Huygens\nmission to Saturn\u2019s moon\nTitan in January 2005. The\nbasic elements \u2013 methane\nrain, a hydrocarbon ocean\nwith huge waves, and cliffs of\nice \u2013 were outlined by one of\nthe British scientists involved\nin the mission, John Zarnecki\nof the Open University, during\na press conference in London\nlast June. They are all reasonable guesses based on\nthe rather limited data avail-able: Titan is certainly cold\nenough for methane and the\nother simple hydrocarbons\npresent to be liquid and for\nwater only to be present as\nice. Zarnecki has even collaborated with oceanographers\nat Southampton to predict\nwhat waves would look like\non a liquid methane ocean\non Titan (big, apparently). On\nthe other hand, some have\nnoted that the same data\nare consistent with the less\nromantic sounding possibility\nof a surface coated in a thick,\noily sludge.\nThe truth is, Titan is one of\nthe most mysterious objects\nin our solar system. It is permanently shrouded in a thick\norange smog that, until last\nmonth\u2019s close encounter with\nthe Saturn orbiter Cassini,\nhas completely obscured the\nsurface from human view.\nCracking Titan\u2019s secrets may\nhave wider implications for\nscientific knowledge than\nmerely filling in a gap in our\nknowledge of the solar sys-tem. Titan\u2019s atmosphere of\nnitrogen and hydrocarbons\nis intriguingly similar to that\nbelieved to have been present\non the early earth. Perhaps\nstudying Titan will give us\na window on our own planet\u2019s past. While the extreme\ncold of the surface (a chilly\n\u2013180\u00baC) rules out the presence of \u2018life as we know it,\nJim\u2019, the processes going on\nat the surface are anyone\u2019s\nguess right now.\nThe moment of truth.\nFriday 14 January 2005,\n1.45pm, Germany:\nA group of scientists from\naround the world are waiting\nnervouslyfornewsfromTitan.\nIf all is going well, Huygens\nwill have just jettisoned its\nheat-shield, opened its first\nparachute and started to take\npictures of the view from\naround 160km above Titan\u2019s\nsurface. Over the next two\nhours, as it descends to the\nsurface, Huygens will beam\nback images and data from\nanalyses of the atmosphere\nto its mothership, Cassini.\nIf the probe survives hitting\nthe surface, whatever that\nturns out to be, another set\nof sensors will rush through\nan analysis of what it has hit,\nsending back data as quick\nas they can, as no-one knows\nhow long the probe will sur-vive. After that, the scientists\nback on earth face an agonising wait while Cassini turns\nand transmits this precious\ndata home.\nFor many of the scientists\nwaitingnervouslyinGermany,\nthis will be the culmination\nof over ten years of work.\nFor the past seven years,\nHuygens has piggybacked\non the spacecraft Cassini\u2019s\ntwo billion mile trip through\nthe solar system. Since July,\nCassini has been orbiting\nSaturn, collecting data on\nthat planet\u2019s famous rings, its\nmoons and its magnet field.\nWhat nobody knew at the\nlaunch was that Huygens\u2019s\ntransmitter had a flaw that\ncould have killed its mission\nbefore it started. A routine\ntest of this transmitter during\nthejourneytoSaturnrevealed\na fault that would have put\nthe signal reaching Cassini\nfrom Huygens during its\ndescent outside the frequency range Cassini could pick\nup. Fortunately the mission\nco-ordinators found a simple\nsolution: they plan to re-route\nCassini during the transmission so that it recedes from\nHuygens more slowly than\noriginally planned. This will\nreduce the Doppler effect\n(the same effect that causes\nthe pitch of an ambulance\nsiren to drop as it speeds\naway from you), raising the\nfrequency of the signal being\nreceived by Cassini into the\nrange it can detect.\nTitan\u2019s atmosphere is both\na blessing and a curse for\nthe Huygens mission. Having\na much thicker atmosphere\nthan Mars makes slowing\nthe probe easier than slowing a lander like Beagle II.\nAs Beagle II spokesman\nColin Pillinger puts it: \u201cAt\nleast going into Titan, it is an\natmosphere that is going to\nstop you.\u201d\nBut dealing with that\natmosphere poses other prob-lems. \u201cWe\u2019ve got pretty good\nat designing instruments\nto work in space, but with\nHuygens we\u2019re entering a\nnew atmosphere for the first\ntime, giving us a whole host of\nnew problems to deal with\u201d,\nexplains Martin Tomasko,\nhead of the team responsible for Huygens\u2019 imaging\nequipment. Data from the\nrecent Cassini fly-by suggest\nthat the atmosphere doesn\u2019t\ncontain corrosive chemicals\nthat could damage Huygens\u2019\ninstruments. But there is a\ndanger that components of\nthe atmosphere could simply\nstick to and obscure the windows from which Huygens\u2019\nimaging systems peer.\nHowever, Tomasko is quietly\nconfident that the windows\nwill not simply steam up with\nhydrocarbon condensation.\nHe notes that, because the\nprobe will be warmer than the\natmosphere, it will in effect\nhave heated windscreens. He\nalso predicts that the clouds\nthat shroud Titan will have\na bottom, giving a clear view\nfrom as high as 50-70km.\nOne of the biggest challenges for the imaging team\nis simply to make sense of\nthe data they get. \u201cThere are\nno lack of challenges,\u201d says\nTomasko. \u201cThe probe is going\nto be swinging, turning and\nbeing blown by the wind.\u201d All\nof these factors need to be\ntaken into account in order to\nfit successive pictures together into panoramic mosaics\nof the landscape below. The\nswinging and turning will be\nmeasured by a sun sensor\nsitting underneath two slits\non top of the probe: whether\nthe sun sensor is in shadow or exposed will depend\non the angle and spin of the\nprobe. Once the probe is out\nof the cloud, making mosaic\nimages should become eas-ier. \u201cIf we can see distinct\nfeatures in our images, we\ncan use these to put mosaics together, rather than relying on reconstructions from\nthe movement of the probe,\u201d\nexplains Tomasko. Despite\nthese problems, the wait long\nfor the first images should\nnot be long. Tomasko and colleagues plan to work through\nthe night on their mosaics so\nthat they can release their\ntwo best images at a press\nconference on 15 January.\nWhat will those pictures\nshow? Tomasko doesn\u2019t want\nto speculate. By his own\nadmission the first glimpses\nof Titan\u2019s surface, gathered\nby Cassini during its recent\nfly-by, are frankly mystifying.\nWhile some features are visible \u2013 dark regions and light\nstreaks \u2013 no-one seems to\nhave much of a clue what\nany of these features are.\nTomasko seems more comfortable predicting what we\nwill not see. He notes thinks\nthat the lack of any bright\nreflection of sunlight (spec-ular reflection) in Cassini\u2019s\nrecent images suggests that\nthe ocean theory is wrong.\nHowever, some dynamic\nprocess seems to be going on\nat the surface. The lack of any\nobvious craters also suggests\nthat the surface is constantly\nbeing remodeled, but by what\nprocess is anyone\u2019s guess.\nOne thing seems sure: if\nthe mission goes to plan, in\nJanuary 2005 we should have\npictures of a very alien landscape indeed.\n\u25cf For further informa-tion, visit the NASA and\nESA mission websites:\nsaturn.jpl.nasa.gov/\nhome/ind1ex.cfm and\nwww.esa.int/SPECIALS/\nCassini-Huygens/index.\nhtml\n\u201cThe truth is that Titan\nis one of the most\nmysterious objects in\nour solar system.

Unfortunately Raph\nwent himself, missing the\nopportunity for another score\nand earning himself a dirty\npint after the match.\nLuckily, our attack kept piling on the pressure and it\nwasn\u2019t long before Pedder\ntouched down for Imperial\u2019s\nsecond try, and converting to\nmake it 14-0 with only 15 minutes gone.\nThe score was then\nincreased again when Achi\nwent over for what was surprisingly his first try of the\nyear. Pedder was on form\nwith his boot and it was 21-0\nto Imperial.\nWith the opposition\u2019s heads\ndown and the game now looking like a formality, some confusion among the back three\nleft GKT with some good\npossession on our 22. This\nspurred them into action and\nafter some desperate defending they crossed our line to\nmake it 21-5.\nWorse was to come, when\nthey crossed again and with\nthe conversion made it 21-12\nafter forty minutes.\nThe second half was now all\nto play for as both sides had\nshowed some great form during patches of the first 40. As\nexpected, the game was now\nmuch more even and despite\nbest efforts, neither team put\nany more points on the board,\nmaking the final score 21-12\nto Imperial.\nNotable performances\ncame from Jovan Nedic on\nhis first team debut and\nJohn Bound on coming out of\nretirement to stand in for our\nhoneymooning lock.\nThis puts the First XV back\nat the top of the league with\nonly three games left to play.\nRUGBY\nRugby Firsts overcome GKT and King\u2019s\nWEDNESDAY\n1 DECEMBER\nBADMINTON\nSurrey Women\u2019s 1st 4\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 4\nFOOTBALL\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 2\nGKT Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nSussex Men\u2019s 1st 4\nImperial Medicals Men\u2019s 1st 0\nHOCKEY\nSussex Women\u2019s 2nd 4\nImperial Medicals\nWomen\u2019s 3rd 0\nRUGBY\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 15\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 33\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 63\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 2nd 5\nBristol Men\u2019s 1st 34\nImperial Medicals Men\u2019s 1st 8\nGKT Women\u2019s 1st 5\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 25\nTENNIS\nSt Mary\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 7\nTHURSDAY\n2 DECEMBER\nBASKETBALL\nLSE Men\u2019s 1st 38\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 47\nSATURDAY\n4 DECEMBER\nFOOTBALL\nGKT Men\u2019s 1st 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 5th 2\nUCL Men\u2019s 7th 2\nSt Bart\u2019s Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 7th 0\nUniversity of the Arts London\nMen\u2019s 1st 6\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 3rd 3\nImperial Medicals Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nSUNDAY\n5 DECEMBER\nFOOTBALL\nGKT Women\u2019s 1st 17\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 0\nVOLLEYBALL\nEssex Men\u2019s 1st 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 1\nMONDAY\n6 DECEMBER\nWATER POLO\nImperial Medicals 1st 4\nUCL 1st 14\nResults\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 15\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 33\nBy David Jackson\nImperial Men\u2019s First XV were\nill-prepared to face King\u2019s,\nwith a plethora of new faces\nin the line-up.\nThe pre-match warm up\nwas shorter than a dwarf tying\nhis shoelaces, however this\ndid not phase the Imperial\nteam by even a radian.\nQuick rucking from a strong\nbut mobile Imperial pack\nallowed their backs to part\nthe King\u2019s defence in a\n\u2018Moses-esque\u2019 fashion. Some\nslinky footwork from Imperial\nnumber seven Raphael fol-lowed, and Imperial were\njubilantly celebrating their\nfirst try.\nThis did not dampen regal\nspirits however: King\u2019s\npressed hard and converted a\npenalty shortly after. Imperial\nthen began to dominate,\nurged on from the touch line\nby afflicted captain Michael\nHicks and his subordinate\nAchi. Some good work from\nJon Spencer offered Gabriel\nthe invitation to finish in the\ncorner, which he took with\naplomb.\nKing\u2019s were shaken but not\nstirred, and subsequently\nadded a breakaway try of their\nown. Imperial increased their\nlead however when Mark\nWills thundered over the line\nwith King\u2019s defenders clutching at his garments. The half\ntime score was Imperial 21,\nKing\u2019s 10.\nThe second half proved\nmuch the same as the first;\nImperial knocking at the\nKing\u2019s door with the fervour\nof a ravenous wolf, but the\nKing\u2019s defence wise to the\ndanger, like three little pigs\nwith television screen entry\nintercom on their cottage.\nEventually incessant pressure paid off, and following a\nsuperb catch and drive line-out and good work from d\u00e9butante Nathan, James Pedder\nglided in for Imperial\u2019s fourth\ntry.\nImperial\u2019s defence was\nthen tested as Kings rallied\nfor a late surge. Imperial prop\nDavid Jackson was harshly\nsin-binned. The writer of this\nreport has it on good authority that he was incredibly\nunlucky.\nKing\u2019s made there numbers\nadvantage pay and converted\nan overlap in the corner,\nmuch to the delight of their\nrowdy supporters. Imperial\nanswered with a fifth and final\ntry minutes after the restart,\nwhen a cleverly worked blind\nside move ended with Gabriel\noff-loading to the omnipresent Steve McLellan. The\nfinal whistle blew as Andrew\nTowers\u2019 conversion attempt\nwas waylaid by the wind.\nRUGBY\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 77\nSt Bart\u2019s Men\u2019s 2nd 3\nBy Andy Wright\nWe found ourselves in South\nLondon about to play rugby.\nThe mission: to destroy St\nBarts, I repeat \u2013 to destroy\nSt Barts.\nAfter an initial advance\nby the heavy armour of the\nImperial forwards, a precision strike from Nick \u2018Iceman\u2019\nWarde opened up the scoring.\nHis follow-up conversion shot\nwas just as clinical. Then Joe\n\u2018Panzer\u2019 Sanders led a break\ninto St Barts\u2019 rear echelon\nand after great support put\nthe bomb on target.\nOn the next advance Ben\n\u2018Lamb Chops\u2019 Thompson\nreceived the ball, after the\nopposition were duped by\nAlex \u2018Ballerina\u2019 Fergusson,\nand went through for a score.\nGreat play throughout the\nsquad led to more tries for\nFergusson and Sanders,\nwho used his forward-firing\nbeer belly to barge through\nthe defence like a German\ntank through French resist-ance. Further scores came\nfrom Pete \u2018KGB\u2019 Sannikov,\nWill \u2018The Corporal\u2019 Mews and\n\u2018Lamb Chops\u2019 again.\nChris \u2018Budgie\u2019 Gosden\nconverted most attempts,\nand some excellent strike\ntackles were seen from Tom\n\u2018The Hitter\u2019 Peatman.

But we are\nstill looking for more players,\nof all skill levels, to further\nstrengthen our squad.\nThe Chess Club meets\nevery Wednesday at 7pm in\nthe Union Building (top floor,\nseminar room 3).\nWe are going to have the\ninaugural Christmas Dinner\nfor our members and their\nfriends. The Dinner will be\non Friday 10 December 2004,\nat 7pm in Kwality Tandoori\nRestaurant (38 Thurloe\nPlace, SW7 2HP). Please\nemail chess@ic.ac.uk if you\nwould like to come.\nOur members will have\nthe opportunity to play a\ngrandmaster in January. We\nalso offer free entry to some\ntournaments. If you are not\nalready a member, it only\ncosts \u00a35 to become one.\nOther events we are planning to organise include a\nsummer trip to Greece (this\nshould provide an excellent\nopportunity to use your summer holiday to have fun with\nsightseeing while exercising\nyour mind with a few games\nof chess), an Imperial College\nChampionship (here the winner and runners-up will get a\nprize) and matches against\nOxford and Cambridge (to\nsee who is at the top of the\ngame). We are going to elect a\nnew committee member soon\nto help us with the amount of\nwork we are undertaking.\nSince the last edition of\nFelix, we have won further\nmatches, to stay top of both\nthe Middlesex League and\nthe ULU League.\nIn the Middlesex League,\nwe have won all our matches convincingly: 8-0 against\nThames Valley University,\n8-0 against LSE, 7-1 against\nHarrow, 5-3 against Hendon\nand 6-2 against Kings Head. I\ndon\u2019t think I need to say more\nabout the performance of our\nplayers here.\nIn the ULU League, we\nhave beaten King\u2019s College\nboth at home (4-2) and away\n(5-1). We were pleased when\nwe outclassed LSE 5-1 at\nhome. After our strong succession of results, we fielded\na team mostly comprised of\nfirst year students, who had\nexpressed their will to play\nfor the team. We happened to\nlose the game 4-2. But, it was\nstill a fairly good result, as we\nplayed five players (out of six)\nwho had never represented\nImperial College Chess Club\nbefore.\nDonald Pang, the organiser\nof the ULU Chess League\n(from UCL) commented,\n\u201cWell, LSE\u2019s crushing\ndefeat at the hands of the\nImperialists comes as a fat\nsurprise to all of us. I\u2019ve also\nheard that Imperial won in\nthe Middlesex league against\nLSE 8-0! This means Imperial\nis a strong contender for the\ntrophy. I\u2019ve also heard that\nLSE\u2019s team is comprised\nsolely of players with a rating\nof more than BCF 140, which\nis a scary thought...\u201d\nThe current committee\nmembers are doing an excellent job with their organisational skills.

This\nwas one of seven divisional\ncompetitions taking place\nacross the UK and as such,\nthe next step will almost\ncertainly take the band to\nthe National Finals at the\nRoyal Northern College of\nMusic in Manchester. This is\na huge achievement for any\nuniversity or college band,\nand an unbelievable success for one without a music\ndepartment.\nThe band performed a\nvaried repertoire of three\narrangements. The first was\nNat Adderley\u2019s Work Song.\nSoloists Pete Hopcroft (alto\nsax) and Martin Cloke (piano),\nalong with Ant Dearden\n(bass), were individually congratulated for their perform-ances.\nThis was followed with a\nchange of pace as singer\nRuth Roberts led the vocal\nballad A Nightingale Sang In\nBerkeley Square. The band\u2019s\nperformance was described\nby the adjudicators as refined\nand idiomatic.\nThe stylish conclusion\nwas Gordon Goodwin\u2019s\nCount Bubba. Solos from\nTom Woodcock and Andy\nThorpe (trombone), and Chaz\nRobertshaw (alto sax) were\ncommended. Jan Marchant\nled the trumpet section \u201cwith\na great sound\u201d.\nIt was perhaps the most\nfocused (and sober) performance the Imperial Big Band\nhave ever given. Obviously\nhowever, when a break came\nup in the schedule, they headed straight to the pub.\nBoth Imperial College Big\nBand and the University of\nSurrey (UNIS) attained gold\nstandard in the open big band\ncategory, the adjudicators\ndescribing both bands\u2019 performances as \u201cat least equal\nto the quality of the National\nFinal last year\u201d. UNIS were\nthe gold medallists of the\nnationwide competition last\nyear. Imperial Big Band and\nUNIS Big Band are now\nmaking plans for a joint gig\nin Guildford, followed by a\nrecording session the next\nday.\nImperial College\u2019s Big\nBand practice together just\nonce a week but it was evident from their performance\nthat an intricate knowledge of\nthe pieces and a life-long\nhabit of listening to the jazz\nmasters propelled them\nthrough the rhythms and\nharmonies in a way that\nyou can\u2019t get from reading\nmusic. Their enthusiasm and\nenjoyment of the music gave\nthem the quality and character that set them apart from\nthe rest.\nOnWednesday15December,\nthe Big Band will be performing a Christmas-themed gig\nin dBs.\nBIG BAND\nImperial Big Band take gold\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\nI haven\u2019t tried\ntoday\u201d\nMAYNARD BURNS, when\nasked how high he could play\n\u201cWhat are those\nidiots in the\nback row playing\nthere?\u201d\nBERT AMBROSE\nThe Big Band at the 2004 summer ball\nBy Farah Vohra\n\u201cHe caught me and tied me\nup and then he started cutting my face.

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nStars are yet another band to come\nout of the eclectic Canadian collective that spawned KC Accidental,\nBroken Social Scene and Metric, the\nbasic premise being that loads of\nart-school musicians (Do Say Make\nThink members, for example) get\ntogether in random little groups\nand make deliberately different\nmusic from their \u2018home\u2019 bands.\nWhen these beard-stroking, arch\npost-rock kids go pop, the results\nare astonishing.\nStars is based around the \u201che said,\nshe said\u201d vocal interplay of the fantastically named Torquil Campbell\nand Amy Millan. You can consider\nthem the most pop end of the col-lective; there\u2019s precious little in the\nway of wigouts, krautrock clicks or\nany of that crap. They aim to take\nover the genre founded by later\nPavement and Stephen Malkmus\n\u2013 the wry, witty pop song, mixing\nexperimentation with clever lyrics\nand hook-laden choruses.\nOpener Your Ex-Lover Is Dead is\na tounge-in-cheek, heart-in-mouth\ndescription of the end of a relation-ship, set against horns and Death\nCab-esque guitar lines. The whole\nthing has a vague resemblance to\nFairyTaleOfNewYork;itcatalogues\nlove gone sour in the same offbeat\nway. In fact, the whole record is\nabout relationships being destroyed,\nfalling apart, or reminisced over.\nCheck out The Big Fight; gentle\nRhodes piano and a slow, gentle\njazz feel allow Torquil and Amy\u2019s\ncall-and-response vocals about the\nmundane facts of a breakup room\nto breathe: \u201cThere are bills here for\nyou / that\u2019s cos nothing is free.\u201d\nAgeless Beauty is a wall of guitar\nnoise, reminiscent of Broken Social\nScene\u2019s Almost Crimes, which\nprogresses slowly and predictably,\nAmy\u2019s soft, schoolgirl-esque vocals\nfloating ethereally over the top,\nbefore a surprising, offbeat flurry of\nhypermelodic guitar noise signals\nthe huge chorus to come crashing\nin while she joyfully proclaimes \u201cWe\nwill always be alive!\u201d A My Bloody\nValentine homage it may be, but its\na damn good one.\nWhat I\u2019m Trying To Say comes\nacross like the Postal Service aping\nSuperchunk; bleepy keyboards and\nsyncopated basslines track a bittersweet tale of love and heavy drug\nuse with yet another killer chorus:\n\u201cI am trying to say / what I\u2019m trying\nto say / without having to say / I love\nyou\u201d. Cheesy is never far away when\nyou\u2019re trying to chronicle romantic\nentanglements, but the clever wit\nand dead-on observations will make\nyou laugh (or cry) it off.\nSpecial mention must go to The\nFirst Five Times for being the best\nsong ever about the first five times\nyou have sex with someone \u2013 it\u2019s\nachingly true, heartrendingly funny\nand just plain genius. A bouncy\nacoustic riff drives Torquil through\nhis reminiscing, before a buzzing\nbassline and heavy drums take us\nto a much darker place: \u201cAnd every\nday / it\u2019s changed since then\u201d, sing\nAmy and Torquil together in gloriously sad harmonies.\nI could talk for hours about how\ngreat this album is. Every song is\na small slice of pop perfection in its\nown right; witness swelling horns\nand soft organs on Sleep Tonight,\ndriving, bouncy basslines and eighties synths on the hopelessly upbeat\npaen to love Set Yourself On Fire,\nor the rush of Pavement guitars\nthat precedes an ode to longlost\nschooldays and Friend\u2019s Reunitedstyle meetings, Reunion. \u201cI had six\ntoo many drinks last night, yes /\nthat\u2019s why I made you stay\u201d sings\nTorquil, like it\u2019s the most romantic\nsentiment ever.\nYou need to hear this record.\nSeriously. It\u2019s moving, at turns\nboth funny and bleak, and it\u2019s full\nof more great melodies and clever\nlyrics than most bands manage in\nan entire career. You owe it to your\nears, your heart, and that little gooey\nbit in your brain that loves great pop\nmusic.\nAndrew Sykes\nMusic Editor\nJim Morrison\u2019s back! Well, he isn\u2019t\nactually, but from looking at the\nfront cover art for the ex-Westlife\nstar\u2019s latest album you can tell\nthat\u2019s the look he\u2019s going for, as the\nrugged former boy band charmer\nnow makes his attempt at a credible,\n\u2018grown up\u2019 record. But coming from\na safe, chart-friendly musical back-ground, you know he\u2019s not going\nto push the boundaries too far, and\nhe\u2019s definitely not going to call himself the new lizard king, take loads\nof drugs and run around naked\nonstage, unlike the aforementioned\nDoors front man.\nOr will he? Songs like Demons and\nHe\u2019s No Hero, with its lyrics of doom\nand alcoholism (sample: \u201cHave you\never, been lost in a different world\n/ where everything you have known\n/ has gone\u2026\u201d), it gives the impression that the squeaky-clean image\nof Westlife hides a history of misuse\nand depression. Well it would do,\nif the actual musical compositions\nincluded in it weren\u2019t so dull and\nconservative.\nYes, it\u2019s his new \u2018mature\u2019 album;\nhowever it mainly stays safe with\nslow, meandering musical compo-sitions: music that makes Keane\nsound like the Kinks. The overall\nsongwriting is uninspired as well,\nwhich is not surprising as he co-wrote the album with Robbie\nWilliam\u2019s ex-songwriter. All songs\nfall into one of two categories: the\nhappy songs about love, or the sad\nsongs about love. And with each\none having a nice slop of schmaltz\napplied to it, you\u2019ve a recipe for\na whole album consisting of dull,\nunmemorable songs, with a few that\nare recognisable purely for being\nexcessively bad \u2013 Sorry, Love Daddy\nbeing a prime example, a real heart\nwrencher written as a goodbye note\nfrom a father who decides to do\na runner. Except it wrenches the\nfunny bone rather then the heart\n(and if someone I knew decided to\nwrite his goodbye like that, I\u2019d be\nglad he\u2019s gone).\nThere are a few reasonably interesting songs on here though \u2013 the\nopener, Irish Son, is a surprisingly\narticulate tune about the strict religious upbringing in his home coun-try, if let down by the cheesiness\nof the tune.

    "content": "Having previously subjected myself\nto two other West End musicals\n\u2013 Les Miserables and Fame \u2013 and\ncome out feeling thoroughly violat-ed, it was with some trepidation that\nI attempted a third, The Lion King,\nlast Wednesday evening.\nBoth previous musicals had been\nexpensive mistakes \u2013 two hours of\nshoddy, half-hearted performance,\nreplete with tired clich\u00e9s, mediocre song and badly choreographed\ndance. Despite these unpromising\ninitial experiences, I had not heard\na bad word spoken about The Lion\nKing \u2013 indeed oft proclaimed the\nmusical of all musicals (an ambiguous compliment in my mind). So,\ntaking a deep breath, I crossed my\nfingers and hoped for the best.\nAnd the best is indeed what I got.\nThe Lion King is a stunning piece of\nmusical theatre (note: musical thea-tre, not musical with all its negative connotations). From the sleek\nlive orchestra, effective staging and\nreverberating song to the phenomenal costumes, everything about this\nshow signals a professionalism and\ndedication quite obviously lacking\nin many other West End perform-ances.\nThe show opens with the chant\nof an African woman, bouncing off\nthe walls of the theatre, filling every\ncrevice with rich, vibrant sound, and\nknocking all other thought from your\nhead. The stage then fills with a\nmenagerie of fantastically clad men\nand women, providing a snapshot\nof the jungle kingdom. This first\ntableau sets the scene for the magic\nto come. There are men on stilts\ndressed as timid giraffes, four men\ncaged into an elephant suit, a lithe\nyoung woman roaming the stage as\na panther, and hordes more performers in varying stages of animal dis-guise. These fill the stage in a flurry\nof uplifting song and dance and glue\nyour eyes to the unbelievable display\nbeing unveiled before you.\nFrom this impressive begin-ning, the well-known story unfolds\nwith the introduction of evil Scar,\nthe old King Mufasa and his young\ncub, Simba. While Scar excels in\nhis role as the evil uncle, from a\nstart as the underdog scathing of\nthe present regime to his demise\ninto a ridiculous leper, he is entertaining throughout. Conversely, both\nMufasa and the young Simba are\nweak leads. Neither come close to\nmeriting stage space with the glorious backdrop of animal magic with\nwhich they share each scene. Both\nare unconvincing main characters\nand fail to invoke sympathy for their\nplight. Mufasa overemphasises his\nrole as benevolent king and young\nSimba, with his tacky grin and false\namity, simply grates on the nerves.\nSomehow, and luckily, such shortcomings fail to impinge on an otherwise spectacular performance. One\nis led to ignore the hiccups of individual artists and become immersed\ninstead in the wonderland expertly\nevoked by a talented team of set and\ncostume designers. Throughout, one\nis aware that no expense has been\nspared to produce authentic set-pieces and magnificent costumes.\nIn fact, The Lion King deserves\nviewing if only for a montage of\nits costumes. Each player has been\ntransformed into a fantastic char-acter, including the conniving hyena\nstooped over and dressed in a grey\ncape, a mask suspended from its\nforehead which bounces maniacally\nas it pounds the stage. Then there\nare the synchronised jungle trees\nof agile dancers decked out in vivid\ngreen leotards and sporting trails\nof green silk who spin and pulsate\nacross the stage. In a bizarre musical interlude, towering giraffes fill\nthe stage, kitted out in multi-col-oured silk cloaks emblazoned with\npatterns and swirls, and launch into\ntoe-tapping song and surprisingly\nnimble dance. Such examples are\njust a taster of the weird and wonderful creatures one is exposed to in\nthe course of the show. No doubt you\nwill find your own favourite among\nthe throng.\nPerhaps you are now asking\nwhether I\u2019ve been paid to advertise\nthe show, by the quantity of superlatives splashed across this article.\nI haven\u2019t. The Lion King really is\nan outstanding piece of entertainment and should be seen by every-one. Whether you want to take leave\nof your intellect and embrace the\nfamiliar songs and well-known story\nor prefer to marvel at such an amazing theatrical production, or indeed\ndo both, you will undoubtedly come\nout satisfied.

You could be just who we\nare looking for!\nEvery year, Dramsoc puts on a\nnumber of plays for your amuse-ment. One of the chosen pieces this\nyear is the pantomime, Jack and\nthe Beanstalk (the first pantomime\nDramsoc has ever done!) It is to\nbe performed in the Union Concert\nHall on January 18 to 22. Well, that\nwas the idea anyway, but there is\none slight problem: the lack of a\ngiant to live up Jack\u2019s beanstalk!\nThat\u2019s right, Dramsoc has run out\nof actors (don\u2019t worry, there are still\nplenty of techies so the Union can\ncontinue to run smoothly). So this is\nwhere all you talented people come\nin. Instead of simply watching the\npantomime you can be in it!\nNow before all you little people\nstop reading, the giant can be big\nor small (irony is a brilliant thing)!\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you have\nnever done any acting before in\nyour life; this isn\u2019t Shakespeare, this\nis pantomime! All you need is to\nbe keen and be willing to attend\nrehearsals, which happen every\nThursday or Tuesday evening (you\nwill not be required to attend all\nrehearsals). Rehearsals are very\nrelaxed and friendly (and often\ninvolve alcohol) and the cast (so far)\nare great!

The story is a classic, and\nso is the music. Last Wednesday, a\nprivileged few had the pleasure of\nhearing Imperial Symphonic Brass\nand Percussion play the arrangement for brass of the music from the\nshow by Eric Crees.\nThe audience was privileged not\nonly due to the nature of the venue,\nthe Union Dining Hall, but also, of\ncourse, in the quality of the perform-ance. The Crees arrangement, originally for the London Symphony\u2019s\nBrass ensemble, is renowned for\nbeing amongst the toughest, if\nnot the toughest, arrangement of\nBernstein\u2019s music.\nThe brass did themselves proud,\nnot to mention the percussion,\n(who for the most part looked a\nbit bored, but were probably just\nlost in concentration trying to keep\ntrack of a thousand different things\nat once, with the exception of Joel\nFarland on the drum kit when he\ngot a chance to show us all what\nhe could do in style). The performance was confident and they nailed\nall the rhythms and themes that\nwe\u2019d all come to hear. The range of\ndynamics was impressive, bringing\nthe music to life in a hugely expressive way. The mambo, cha-cha and\nAmerica were all full of Latin spirit,\nand the finale had some truly heartbreaking moments.\nThe performance was full of jazz,\nswinging right along, and was over\nfar too soon! This was a brief concert enjoyed by all attending that\nhas definitely won the Brass more\nfans.

    "content": "INTERVIEW\nRegular readers may recall that previously I have enthused about the\nmerits of DJ and former Imperial\nstudent Ian Betts and his production Love Resurrection. I invited\nIan back to College to find out how\nyou go from being an Imperial\ngraduate to one of the most talked\nabout names in the London trance\nscene with bookings from here to\nThailand.\nFELIX: Welcome back then!\nHow are you?\nIAN BETTS: Very well thanks! But\npretty busy. With a full time job,\nDJing and the production stuff\nalways on the go, it can get a bit\nhectic, but I can\u2019t really complain.\nNice of you to spare us the\ntime then. You were here a\nwhile ago weren\u2019t you?\nYeah, from \u201989 to \u201992, I did geology in\nthe RSM. I think I\u2019ve been back once\nsince I graduated, that was about\nten years ago.\nNotice anything different?\nNot really. It all looks remarkably\nsimilar to back then. The [Beit]\nQuad is a bit tidier and looks like\nit might have had a bit of a paint,\nand there used to be a games room\nwhere those toilets are, but this [the\nUnion Bar] looks almost exactly as\nI remember it, and I knew it quite\nwell! There\u2019s also that big white\nframe thing on the road up here.\nThe Tanaka Business School.\nOh right. That wasn\u2019t there when I\nwas here. It doesn\u2019t quite look fin-ished...?\nStrange you should say that.\nSo, you did geology, and now\nyou\u2019re a world famous DJ. Not\nexactly a common career path\nis it?\nIt\u2019s not quite like that. I only really\nDJ part time. During the day I\u2019m\nan IT consultant for an American\nbank. I left uni with a massive debt\nand ended up getting a job in a meat\nfactory to pay it off. While I was\nthere I bought myself a computer\nand taught myself IT and it kind of\ndeveloped from there. The DJing\ncame much later. And I wouldn\u2019t say\n\u2018world famous\u2019.\nSo what were you like as an\nundergraduate?\nMany drunken nights spent in\nSouthside, and RSM bar nights on\nWednesdays with the chaps and\ntheir drinking games.\nGood grief, things really\nhaven\u2019t changed!\nHa ha, probably not, no. I was into\nmy indie and rock stuff back then\ntoo, I almost got involved with Felix\nand the radio station, but I never got\nround to it. I played drums and guitar in a band though, and we used\nto practise in the basement of the\nUnion in this dingy little room with\ngrotty carpets and a smoky kind of\nstench.\nWere you any good? What\nwere you called?\nWe were called (hangs head in\nshame) Easy Meat.\nEasy Meat?!\nI know, I know, it wasn\u2019t my choice,\nI was out-voted three to one. But\nwe weren\u2019t that bad, we played a\nheadline gig at the Mean Fiddler\nonce and the Garage another time.\nWe split up after a year or two when\none of the guitarists went to Cardiff,\nand then I joined another, more\nfolky band. The music background\nprobably helped with picking up the\nDJing.\nSo how did you get into trance\nif you were an indie kid?\nWell dance music didn\u2019t really exist\nwhen I started uni and it only began\nto pick up after I left. Basically,\nwhen I was working at the factory,\nsome of the guys went to a bar one\nevening and then just said \u201cHey,\nlets go to a club\u201d. We went along, it\njust clicked with me, and I\u2019ve never\nlooked back!\nWhat about the DJing?\nThat was even later. I had been buying records for a while, all the stuff I\nwas hearing out at the weekends, I\u2019d\nbuy it just because I loved it. I had\nno intention of playing it seriously,\nDJing never crossed my mind, I just\nhad a basic turntable. And then it\ngot to a stage where we thought that\nthe scene had changed too much,\nthe clubs weren\u2019t as good as they\nwere in the old days etc.\nSome things really don\u2019t\nchange then?\nExactly. So they said to me, you\u2019ve\ngot a load of records, why don\u2019t\nyou start playing? It seemed like a\nreasonable idea so I bought myself\na pair of belt-driven hi-fi turntables\nand taught myself to mix on those. It\nwas only a hobby back then though,\nI never considered taking it any fur-ther, didn\u2019t dream of it. But I picked\nit up, and about three years later in\n\u201999 I started my own promotion so\nthat I could start to play out to real\npeople.\nAnd it all kicked off from\nthere?\nNot at all. Like I said, back then it\nwas just a bit of fun, literally a hobby.\nIt only really started to gather any\nmomentum about 18 months ago.\nI was made redundant just before\nthat, and I got a pretty decent redundancy package, so I decided to buy a\nload of new kit. I got myself set up\nwith a studio at home, bought myself\nsome proper decks and started\ngetting gigs and doing it more\nseriously. Around March last\nyear, I played a gig for Heat at\nTurnmills and Steve Hill [Kiwi leg-end, DJ, producer, record label\nboss] was there, as well as Damo\n[HeatUK head honcho]. I played\nLove Resurrection as my first tune\nand the place absolutely went off,\nSteve ran into the booth asking what\nit was, and when I told him it was my\nown tune he immediately wanted it\nfor his new record label and called\nme every day for the next week asking about it.\nAnd that\u2019s when it all kicked\noff?\nOh yeah! Damo loved the set as well\nand I got asked back to play a few\nmore gigs for Heat, I started playing out on a more regular basis, my\nname got around and I was asked to\nbe the other Heat resident back in\nFebruary.\nAnd now you\u2019re one of the biggest trance DJs in London.\nHa ha! People always say this to\nme, but I honestly don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s\nreally strange, like being in the eye\nof the storm where everything is\njust going on around you. I guess\nbecause it\u2019s happened so gradually\nand I never really intended it to take\noff, I haven\u2019t noticed anything that\ndifferent.\nOh come on! Heat resident\n[they only have two], headline\nsets for Twisted, Cream at Amnesia in Ibiza, tunes played on\nRadio 1... you aren\u2019t exactly\n\u2018local\u2019 any more.\nThose things were all astonishing.\nI did a three hour headline set for\nTwisted at the Fridge, and it baffled\nme. I fully expected no-one to turn\nup and the place was absolutely\nrammed, I suppose that\u2019s when I\nstarted to think \u201cHmmm, maybe\nthere\u2019s something in this?\u201d\nThe Amnesia gig came about\nbecause Heat were doing a week\nof co-promotions out there. Damo\nsuggested me to Cream, I sent them\na demo and they booked me for the\nopening set. I played before Armin\nvan Buuren!\nWhat was that like?\nStrange. I was perfectly fine for the\nwhole day and directly before the\ngig, people kept asking me if I was\nnervous but I actually wasn\u2019t. I knew\nwhat I was doing, why would I be?\nIt all went great, it started off with\na couple of hundred people there\nwhose faces I mostly knew, which\nwas nice. By the end there were a\nfew thousand people there. Armin\nliked it, I had a chat with him, shook\nhis hand, all fairly usual, and then I\nleft the DJ booth. All of a sudden I\nrealised what I\u2019d just done, that I\u2019d\njust finished playing to five thousand\npeople in the best club in the world\nand they\u2019d loved it. I stood by the\nbar for about two hours in an utter\ndaze, just staring around, not really\nknowing what to do. I had to leave, it\nwas too much to take in. That whole\nexperience is definitely the pinnacle\nso far!\nAnd then there was Love\nResurrection...\nIndeed. I\u2019d had the idea for a while,\nand then when I got my studio I had\nthe chance to give it a go. People\nseemed to love it, and because I only\ngave it to a very few select people,\nit was mostly me who played it so it\nbecame associated with me, which\nprobably helped. It finally went to\npress a couple of weeks ago. 750\nwere printed and it sold out in about\n10 days apparently. I think we\u2019re\ngoing to get another 750 done, it\u2019s\nbeen licensed to a couple of MoS\ntype compilations in South Africa\nand they use it in most of the jingles\non their equivalent of Radio 1, and\nas you say, you can get it in HMV\nJapan.\nNot to mention Radio 1 in this\ncountry...\nThat was also awesome. I\u2019d played\nat Knowwhere on the Friday night\njust before Dave Pearce and used it\nas my last tune. As usual the reaction was incredible, he noticed, so\nI gave him a copy, rather hopefully.\nThen on Sunday night I was driving\nhome listening to Dance Anthems,\nI was about a mile from home and\nI heard the beat coming in, I went\ncrazy, I had to pull over and catch\nmy breath until it finished, it was\nincredible.\nYou did some radio work yourself didn\u2019t you?\nWell, I did a show on [internet radio\nstation] TranceAirwaves for a while.\nI sent them an email and demo\nasking if they wanted any DJs,\nand they said yes. Sadly it doesn\u2019t\nexist anymore, those kind of things\ncost money, especially when you\u2019re\nstreaming terabytes of data, and\nthey just weren\u2019t getting the investment needed. It\u2019s a shame because\ninternet radio is a fantastic resource\nand I think it is definitely the way\nforward. The potential audiences\nare huge and it\u2019s mush easier to get\ninternet radio going than a proper\nradio station.\nSo what have you got lined up\nfor next year?\nWell, I\u2019m going back to do a small\ntour of Australia some time, a few\ndates around Sydney, Melbourne,\nPerth. Apparently there\u2019s already a\nbuzz and they expect tickets for a\nboat party to sell out pretty quickly.\nI\u2019m going to Thailand to do a Full\nMoon party for Heat, there\u2019s a big\noutdoor event in Cape Town with a\n4000 people arena that I\u2019ll probably\nbe doing and Steve [Hill] is always\non the look out for stuff in Oz and\nNZ. They\u2019ve asked me back to Ibiza\nnext season.\nAny chance of seeing you in\nthis country?\nHa ha! Of course. I\u2019m playing the\nmain room at Brixton Academy\nfor New Years Eve with Heat and\nThe Gallery, plus there\u2019s the Heat\nChristmas Party at KoKo [formerly\nCamden Palace] this Friday which\nis going to be awesome. They\u2019ve\ncompletely refurbished CP and it\nlooks so plush, all the Heat DJs\nwill be there, the atmosphere will\nbe fantastic and it\u2019s just going to be\nbrilliant. If you get there early there\nwill be some tickets on the door. I\u2019m\nalso taking bookings for April and\nMay already, there\u2019s Heat Evolution\nin January as well as Knowwhere\nthat month. Heat have some massive things planned for next year,\nthings that will blow what they\u2019ve\ndone so far out of the water, so look\nout for those.\nSo you\u2019re planning on running\nwith the DJ thing? Don\u2019t fancy\nheading back into promotion?\nNot really, now the DJing is working\nnicely I think I\u2019ll stick with it. I\u2019m\nstill going to be doing a lot of production work too, there\u2019s about five\nthings in the pipeline, I\u2019m back off\nhome now to get in the studio with\nMarc [French, Heat DJ] and there\nmay be a Heat LP sometime next\nyear too.\nAny advice for the kids that\nwant to get into DJing?\nIt\u2019s clich\u00e9d I know, but it really is\nall about practise, practise as much\nas possible, and try to be differ-ent. Promoters hear hundreds of\ndemos a week so you have to stand\nout \u2013 playing anthems will get you\nnowhere. Do your own productions,\nremix stuff, be different. These days,\nabout 75% of what I play is either\nmy own original work or remixes/\nreworks that I\u2019ve done. And talk to\nthem, go to their events and get to\nknow them. They are more likely to\nrespond to you if they see you out\nand about than if you just send them\na CD and never follow it up.\nOK then, finally, what did you\nthink of the DJ Mag Top 100?\nI think this year\u2019s results show just\nhow global the poll is now, and the\ngrowing popularity of dance music\nin America. I also think a lot of\nDJs place too much importance on\nmaking it into the list \u2013 the Top 10\nis pretty much impenetrable at the\nmoment. The DJs got where they\nare through hard work but they have\nalso turned themselves into widely\nrecognisable \u2018brands\u2019 and so will\nalways feature highly in such polls.\nI do respect PvD and Ferry Corsten\nbecause they are consistently good,\nand Ferry is one of the most innovative producers around. The list does\nhighlight which genres are most\npopular though; trance is that big\noutside London, it\u2019s up there with\nhouse, even in England, you don\u2019t\nfind many hard dance clubs outside\nLondon.\nThanks very much for taking\nthe time to speak to us. Anything else you\u2019d like to add?\nJust that it\u2019s the KoKo club this\nweekend and then Heat NYE at\nBrixton, tickets are selling fast so if\nyou fancy coming along then I suggest you get in there quick.\nDominic Farrell\nIan Betts: from RSM to Radio 1\nBetts: knows where he\u2019s headed\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 9 December 2004\n18\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

The previous president,\nLeonid Kuchma, was intent\non restarting the entire\nelection from scratch in an\nattempt to bring someone\ninto the contest alongside\nYush and Yank.\nVladimir Putin, the billionaire Russian prime minister,\nofferednoreactiontothenews\nas he hid his fury behind a veil\nof adjectives aimed implicitly\nat the US, the driving force\nbehind the re-elections.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 9 December 2004\n8\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nFeel like a smoke?\nWhen the Government acted to\nreclassify cannabis, there was a lot\nof confusion over its legality. The\ntruth is that cannabis is still illegal,\nand if you are using it over a long\nperiod of time it can affect every\naspect of your life.\nThis article aims to help you and\ntell you some facts about cannabis\nthat you might not know:\nDependency\nDuring the last few years it has\nbecome clear that cannabis use can\nresult in dependency and lead to\nproblems. Ask yourself this: Are you\nspending too much time, energy and\nmoney on weed? Does a lot of your\nday revolve around dope? Do those\nclose to you complain that you are\nstoned all the time? If your answer\nto these questions is yes then you\nmay be dependent on cannabis.\nMental health\nIf you have had a mental health\nproblem before or if you have a history of mental health problems in\nyour family, cannabis can trigger\nthem. There is also concern that\npeople who use cannabis a lot when\nthey are young may be vulnerable to\nmental health problems later in life.\nDebt\nOne of the most common problems\nwith cannabis is spending too much\nmoney on it. Try to see how much\nmoney you are spending each week\non cannabis and think about all the\nother things you could buy with the\nmoney.\nRelationships\nCannabis can make people boring,\nlifeless and isolated. Smoking dope\nall the time can lead to problems\nat work, in your personal life and at\ncollege.\nDo you have a vibrant social life or\nare you staying in most nights and\nwatching TV? Is your partner giving\nyou earache about your lack of moti-vation? Are you just smoking cannabis because your partner does?\nIf these things are happening to\nyou, it may be time to review your\ncannabis use.\nCollege life\nStudying and smoking cannabis in\nmost cases don\u2019t mix. If you smoke\ncannabis on a regular basis, you\nmay well be missing lectures, unmo-tivated by university life, and/or just\nsitting indoors all day.\nIt is also important to remember\nthat if you are found to be smoking cannabis in University halls of\nresidence, then you will probably be\nevicted and may be asked to leave\nthe College totally.\nThe law\nCannabis is a class C drug. It is ille-gal. The maximum sentence for possession is two years in prison and an\nunlimited fine. The maximum penalty for supplying cannabis is 14 years\nin prison and an unlimited fine.\nPeople aged 18 or over are no\nlonger automatically arrested for\npossessing cannabis, however you\nwill be arrested if you are caught\nregularly, you smoke in public\nplaces, or you use cannabis near\npremises where children and young\npeople go.\nSelf control tips\n\u25cf Avoid overdoing it, by having days\noff between using cannabis. This\nwill also help you to lose any tolerance you might have built up from\nregular use\n\u25cf Don\u2019t buy extra, thinking you\u2019ll\nsave some for tomorrow. You probably won\u2019t\n\u25cf Break up your pattern of use\n\u2013 this will make it easier to control\nand reduce the risks\n\u25cf If you are trying to cut down and\nstop, avoid any places, people or\nevents that remind you of cannabis.\nPlan to do something else at the\ntime of day you usually have a joint\n\u25cf Try to identify all the things you\nassociate with using cannabis and\nmake an effort to avoid them until\nyou feel OK about not smoking\nIf you have any comments on this\narticle or are worried about your\ncannabis use, please don\u2019t hesitate\nto contact the Union Advice Service\non 020 7594 8067 or advice@ic.ac.uk.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nThe cost of living\nA common student complaint is that\nthe cost of living in halls is too high.\nRents are too expensive and it is\noften more economical to live in\nthe private sector \u2013 often even after\nthings like gas/electricity bills, laundry and contents insurance (all free\nor subsidised in halls) have been\ntaken into account. Is this really\ntrue?\nIt\u2019s certainly true that some\nrooms in halls are priced at quite\nhigh levels. Paying around \u00a3140 a\nweek (after amenities and other\ncharges) for a room in Beit can\nseem excessive when private sector\nflats are available for less than that.\nNevertheless, the College has a real\nproblem: there is no government\nmoney to fund halls of residence\nwhich, by law, have to be self-financ-ing. In actual fact, the College gets\naway, where it can, with cross-sub-sidies but basically the halls have\nto break even. The cost of building\nand maintaining halls of residence\nhas to be met somehow. Only so\nmuch money can be raised from\nconference income. Ultimately, the\nresidents have to make a large con-tribution.\nThat was the backdrop to last\nyear when Katherine McGinn (then\nDeputy President Education &\nWelfare) and I faced the Rector\u2019s\nCommittee on Student Residences\nfor the annual rent review. The\nEstates people responsible for looking after the buildings maintained\nthat they needed an increase of\nupwards of 10% in order to keep\nthings in order. We successfully\nargued the case that students were\nincreasingly being priced out and\nthat they needed to be contained.\nIn the end we secured an average\nreal rise of only 4.5%, although the\ncheapest rooms stayed at the same\nprice whilst the most expensive had\nlarge increases.\nYet the maintenance problems are\nreal. Only yesterday, my own hall\nof residence had problems with the\ndrinking water supply \u2013 unusual for\nGarden Hall, but quite common for\nthose in Southside. Any \u2018success\u2019\nthe Union has in holding down rent\nprices in the short term is only going\nto cause problems for students in\nthe long-term. Just look at the crumbling state of Southside and Fisher\nHall, both suffering from shoddy\nmaintenance and underinvestment\nover the years. But every time a\nhall is refurbished, the rents have to\ngo up to pay for it. This means that\nwhen Southside is knocked down at\nthe end of June 2004, there will be a\nserious reduction in medium-priced\naccommodation and a big overall\nincrease in average rent prices.\nSo a new approach is needed.\nThe College needs to recognise\nthat whilst Beit is always over-sub-scribed (and so the rents can seemingly keep going-up) there are many\nstudents who can\u2019t pay the full cost.\nMore importantly, \u2018poorer\u2019 students\nshould not be given lower quality\naccommodation as it is demeaning and also results in ghettoisa-tion (with some halls being seen as\n\u2018rich\u2019 and others as being for \u2018poor\u2019\nstudents).\nI think that all students who come\nto the College should be given a\nfixed price for living in hall, which\nshould be the full cost \u2013 let\u2019s say\n\u00a3150 per week. From that, there\nshould then be subsidies (paid for\nwithin the residences system).\nStudents who are allocated poorer\nquality rooms should be compensated with a rebate. Students who\ncan\u2019t afford to pay should similarly\nreceive a bursary to enable them\nto live in hall. This should be separate from government loans etc,\nbecause it would appear that the\nmost hard-up students fall into two\ncategories: those for whom the state\nmeans testing doesn\u2019t work (eg they\nare just above the threshold for full\nsupport or their parents\u2019 income\nhas been mis-assessed) or they are\nfrom overseas and not in receipt of\na scholarship. That way, everyone\nwould be able to live in hall and\nwouldn\u2019t be forced into a particularly shabby one based on the ability\nto pay. Meanwhile, those who can\npay their share would do, to keep the\nsystem operational.\nThat\u2019s a personal view, based on a\npragmatic appraisal of the political\nand economic situation. I suspect\nit will be be controversial \u2013 I look\nforward to reading your views in the\nletters pages.\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nBy Ian Lawrence\nToday I had to step around the body\nof a man on my way to campus,\ntrying to avoid getting blood on my\nshoes. I\u2019ve never seen a dead body\nbefore, but in the last week two people have died violently in the streets\nnear me. What is happening?\nThe apparent cause was that the\nman had jumped off the roof, but the\npolice had to investigate it as a mur-der. They asked me if I\u2019d seen anyone upstairs. Not being a city boy,\nit didn\u2019t occur to me to look. It says\nsomething about the times we live\nin that I just carried on walking, the\npolice seemed to be dealing with it\nand I hadn\u2019t actually seen it happen,\nso I just went to uni, sat through a\nlecture and came home.\nOn the way home, the police had\ncordoned off the area in a very efficient manner. This is disturbing in a\nstrange way; the police knew exactly\nwhat to do, they had a procedure\nfor it. I mean, it\u2019s comfortable that\nthe police are professional, but why\nshould they have to deal with this\nsort thing so often?\nI only came to London a couple\nof months ago, and my first impressions were that people were exaggerating about the violence and the\ncrime, that the newspapers used a\nlot of hyperbole and only reported\nthe bad events. These two deaths\nhave blown that impression out\nof the water. I now leave my halls\nwondering what will happen today,\nwondering who will die. Will it be\nsomeone I know? Will it be me?\nI don\u2019t know what drove this man to\nsuicide, or whether he was pushed,\nbut surely there must be something\nthat can be done to prevent this sort\nof thing happening. Support groups\nobviously aren\u2019t enough. I\u2019m sure\nthis man had access to a telephone,\nbut he didn\u2019t phone the Samaritans,\ndid he? Maybe his friends were\nsuspicious and were rushing to his\nhouse to stop him, or maybe he had\nno friends.\nThe only thing we can do is to\nwatch out for each other, keep an\neye on the lonely people, or even the\nones who are always surrounded,\nare they really happy? Suicide is\nan intensely selfish act. Think of\nthe anguish this man has caused\nto the people who saw him fall, to\nhis friends and family, who will probably blame themselves. He caused\nme to be in a state of shock and\nwrite this rambling article, despite\nthat fact I haven\u2019t written an essay\nin years.\nEven the most cold-hearted of you\ncouldn\u2019t help to be shocked by this if\nyou saw it. My friend and I tried to\nlaugh it off, but we both knew this\nwas just to distract our thoughts, to\navoid thinking the big thoughts that\nI thought on the way home, alone. To\nquestion our own mortality. I leave\nyou with my final thought \u2013 don\u2019t\nthink you\u2019re unshockable, because\nwhen something like this happens,\nit really, really gets to you.\nThe world today\n\n"

This is pretty bad going for\na TV show (compared to The Fast\nShow, for instance, which registers\nat around 0.6). But when measuring the laughs per joke ratio for\nChurchill: The Hollywood Years, I\nfound it to be closer to around 0.13\n\u2013 which is ridiculously low, especially for a feature length film. On this\n\u2018scientific\u2019 basis alone, the movie\nwas a dismal failure.\nBut forgetting the scientific method for a moment, what could I say\nabout a movie whose premise is\nthat the Winston Churchill we know\nand respect was actually an after-dinner speaker and character actor\ncalled Roy Bubbles? What could I\nsay about a movie that has a joke\nabout Hitler driving a car straight\ninto a wall? What could I say about\na movie that tries to take one of the\ngrimmest periods of modern history\nand turn it into a comedic farce?\nYou could say \u2018congratulations\u2019\nbecause despite being a patched-up,\nnonsensical sequence of tenuously\nconnected sketches, in Churchill:\nThe Hollywood Years there are\ngenuinely a few decent laughs to\nbe had. Although it is not in the\nsame league as the sickeningly\nhilarious Bad Santa (which measures at around 0.75 laughs per joke),\nit will provide a decent evening\u2019s\nlight entertainment thanks to the\ncomedic talents of Harry Enfield,\nPhil Cornwell (Dave Clifton from\nI\u2019m Alan Partridge) and Vic Reeves,\nwho embellish the film with a few\nmemorable scenes.\nSo once you\u2019ve realised after\nthe first five minutes that this is not\ngoing to be a conventional experience \u2013 once you have accepted that\nand somewhat changed your expec-tations, then the rest is plain sailing\nand rather enjoyable.\nDarius Nikbin\nChurchill: The Hollywood\nYears\nDirector: Peter Richardson\nStarring: Neve Campbell, Christian\nSlater, Harry Enfield\nLength: 85 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHIII\nBritain\u2019s finest hour becomes Hollywood\u2019s greatest story.

I am\nabsolutely fascinated by all\nthis. Titan is the largest moon\nin the solar system but it has\nalways been shrouded in mystery due to its dense atmos-phere.

To achieve\nthe maximum storage capac-ity, the MODS discs will be\ndouble sided and dual lay-ered, and instead of storing\none bit per pit like conventional CDs and DVDs, MODS\ndiscs can store eight bits due\nto the asymmetrical nature of\nthe pits.\nDr Peter T\u00f6r\u00f6k will be\nattending a meeting later on\nthis year to find out if the\ndiscs are viable for mass\nmanufacture, and is confident\nthat their fabrication will be\neasy and cheap. Research\nand funding permitting, Dr\nT\u00f6r\u00f6k estimates that the discs\nwill be available on the market within five to ten years.\nAlthough he emphasised\nthat \u201cthere have been a lot of\nmisinterpretations and misunderstandings\u201d surrounding the new discs, and this\ntimescale is \u201clargely affected\nby political and financial factors as well as technological\nfactors\u201d, a fact missed out by\na large majority of articles\ncovering this technology.\nThe BluRay disc, although\ntechnically sound, has had its\ndate of release pushed back\ndue to these reasons. Before a\nnew data disc comes into the\nmarket, a universal standard\nmust be agreed by the companies which will produce it,\nwhich can take a great deal of\ntime. The BluRay consortium\nwas set up for this very pur-pose, to establish a universal standard for the BluRay\nmedia. The other factor is\nthat the companies will want\nto make as much money as\nthey can out of previous technologies before they render\nthem obsolete and embrace\nnew ones. This can be seen by\nthe fact that only now is VHS\nbeing withdrawn from sale,\nand DVDs are being given\ngreater emphasis. BluRay\ncan only come out once\nthe companies have made\nenough money from the sale\nof DVDs, or they are forced\nto market their product by\nthe competition, and consequently MODS discs will most\nlikely be able to come on to\nthe market once the companies have milked all they can\nfrom BluRay.\nOnce it has been established whether it is technologically and financially possible to mass-produce MODS\ndiscs and share data, the\nteam hope to further research\nwhether a writing/rewriting\nfacility can be made available.\nDr T\u00f6r\u00f6k mentioned that they\ndo have the capacity to reach\nthat status, but again it is\nheavily dependent on further\nfunding.\n30-year data storage pioneer Michael Thomas, owner\nof Colossal Storage, believes\nthat the concept will fail\nbecause the design is prone\nto complex errors, and that\nit may just be better to continue to store large amounts\nof data on a hard drive, but\nDr T\u00f6r\u00f6k believes that this\nis only partially true. Any\ndata system relying on fitting\na large amount of data in a\nsmaller space will always be\nprone to error for a number of\nreasons, even when comparing DVD and CD discs. The\nsame thickness of scratch on\na DVD takes out many more\nbits of data than on a CD, and\nthis effect is even greater for\nMODS discs, especially as the\nwavelength of light involved\nis significantly smaller\n(around 405nm). This does\nnot mean, however, that the\nwhole technology can be\ndismissed and in actual fact\nthe BluRay disc is likely to\nbe similarly scratch sensi-tive. Hard drives are in fact\nfar more delicate than discs,\nhence having to keep them\ncontained. The advantage of\nMODS discs when it comes\nto data protection is that a\nlarge number of discs can\nbe produced for low cost, so\nduplicate copies will be easy\nto produce.\nDr T\u00f6r\u00f6k emphasised that\nwhilst you could fit a large\namount of data on one disc,\nfor example a few series of\nThe Simpsons, it may not\nnecessarily reduce the cost\nof the MODS on the market.\nWhilst they are still cheap to\nproduce, movies and music\nwill still be subject to additional charges. \u201cYou don\u2019t buy\nthe disc [in that case], you\nsupport the large number of\npeople behind the production\u201d, so all episodes of a TV\nseries on one MODS disc will\ncost no less than a box set of\nDVDs, but there will be the\nadded convenience of having\neverything on one disc and\nsaving valuable space on the\nshelf.\nHe also stressed that the\nproject is very much col-laborative, with a number of\npeople significantly involved,\nincluding his PhD student,\nMr Peter Munro. The other\nmembers of the team are Dr\nMartin Salt, Professor Hans\nPeter Herzig and Mr Carsten\nRockstuhl from the University\nof Neuchatel in Switzerland\nand Emmanouil Kriezis\nfrom Aristotle University of\nThessaloniki in Greece.\nThe team have applied for\nfunding to EPSRC and are\ncurrently in the process of\nwriting a European grant\napplication to fund their\nresearch further. The latter\none is a collaboration between\nthe Imperial physics and electrical engineering (led by Dr\nEric Yeatman) departments,\nthe Technical University\nof Delft, the University of\nNeuchatel and Aristotle\nUniversity. Dr T\u00f6r\u00f6k has also\nset up a website to reveal the\nfacts behind popular claims,\nas well as further details\nbehind the new technology.\nThis can be found at www.\nimperial.ac.uk/research/\nphotonics/pt_group/peter_\ntorok_research.htm.\n[insert interesting research story here]\nI, Science.\nA science magazine for Imperial College\ncontact science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBlind car thief 0, tree 1\nDARIUS NIKBIN\nSCIENCE EDITOR\nMODS: the team at Imperial have created a new method\nfor storing 1TB (one terabyte) of data on one optical disc\n\u201cthere have been a lot\nof misinterpretations\nand misunderstandings\nsurrounding the new\ndiscs...\u201d\n\n"
