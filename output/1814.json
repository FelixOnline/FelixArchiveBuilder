    "content": "At the end of last week, it was\nreported that the UK government\nwas planning to curb the number of\ninternational students coming to\nthe UK, in response to record\nhigh immigration numbers,\nsurpassing 500,000 net into\nthe UK in the year to June.\nThis paper disagrees with the\ndogma that high immigration\nto the UK is a bad thing,\nbut for the sake of\nargument, and to place\nourselves in the shoes\nof the Sunak government, we\nmust proceed pretending it is.\nThe 2019 Conservative\nManifesto states that \u201cthere will be\nfewer lower-skilled migrants [coming\ninto the UK] and overall numbers\nwill come down\u201d. The Conservative\ngovernment, in its 2019 International\nEducation Strategy (reaffirmed in\n2021), stated as its goals that UK\neducation exports (UK institutions\nteaching overseas students) would rise\nto \u00a335bn per year, and that the number\nof international students studying in\nthe UK will rise to 600,000, both by\n2030. Good luck squaring those goals.\nOf course, the two could be brought\nmoreintolinebyomittinginternational\nstudent numbers from immigration\nstats, as the USA does, but that\nstrategy seems to have been eschewed.\nNet immigration numbers are so\nhigh because of the war in Ukraine\nand the recently introduced Hong\nKong visa scheme, following the\nCCP\u2019s ever-tightening constriction\nof Western freedoms in Hong Kong.\nSmaller numbers are made up by\nrefugees from Afghanistan and by the\nrecord 40,000 that have crossed the\nEnglish Channel in small boats so far\nthis year. The UK has accepted almost\n190,000 Ukrainian refugees since\nFebruary, and 123,000 Hong Kongers\nhave applied for a UK visa since the\nWelcome Programme was launched\non Jan 31st 2021, the UK Government\nannounced in July this year. As almost\nnone of these individuals will have\nreturned to their home states since,\ni t can be reasonably\nassumed that they\nmake up well over\nhalf of the influx.\nRunning these\nschemes is a moral\nimperative, the UK\nshould be proud\nof them, and about\nthe worst thing to do\nwould be to offset the\nnumbers by jettisoning\nlargely rich foreign students.\nThis being said, international\nstudent numbers are in fact increasing.\nImperial College, with one of the\nhighest proportions of international\nstudents of all UK universities,\nincreased its total number of students\nwho paid international fees from\n6,138 in 2016 to 8,924 in 2020, a 45%\nincrease in just four years. This should\nnot be surprising. Most universities\ntoday operate as businesses, and\nother than in unusual cases such\nas medical students, international\nstudent numbers are not capped.\nThe subtle knife though is the fees\npaidbyhomestudents.In2012thecap\nonstudentfeeswasraisedsubstantially\nto \u00a39,000, and in 2017 it rose slightly\nagain to \u00a39,250 and has remained\nfrozen since. \u00a39,000 in 2012 would\nbe worth almost \u00a312,000 today, or to\nput it differently, \u00a39,250 today would\nbe worth just over \u00a37,000 in 2012.\nUniversities cannot and should not be\nexpected to shrink economically, but\nfreezing home fees forces them to do\nso, unless they are able to find other\nsources of revenue, such as drawing\nin more foreign students. If the UK\ngovernment really wants international\nstudent numbers to reduce, they\nshould un-freeze home student\nfees, increase them with inflation\n2\nJamie John DeputyEditor\nSam Lovatt\nManaging\nEditor\nAngie Lo\nHeadScience\nEditor\nTaylor Pomfret ScienceEditor\nJonah Hewett FilmEditor\nMike Buzadji FilmEditor\nTara PalChaudhuri\nMusicEditor\nJoe Riordan MusicEditor\nZanna Buckland BooksEditor\nZhifan Xu BusinessEditor\nHarry Schlote BusinessEditor\nSimran Patel\nEnvironment\nEditor\nMarie Mori\nEnvironment\nEditor\nThis issue was produced\nthanks to the work of\nAnd our numerous\ncontributors\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nA curb on international student\nnumbers means the government must\nconsider raising the cap on home fees\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Iliffe Media\nWinship Road,\nMilton,Cambridge\nCB24 6PP\nRegistered Newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2020\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

As\nNeagu sees it, \u201cthe society is the\nmiddleman\u2014connecting students to\ncareers. Our goal is to give them as many\nopportunities as possible\u201d. Though the\nsociety has distanced itself from certain\ncompanies in the past due to differences\nin values, it has never fully turned down\na sponsorship. Neagu says it is very\npossible for the society\u2019s members to\ngo on to a career in the oil industry and\nmake change for the better.\nPete Knapp, environmental activist\nat ICA, disagrees: \u201cYou can\u2019t change a\nfossil fuel company from the inside.

Companies such as ExxonMobil\nhave, in the past, downplayed the effects\nof extracting oil from the earth.

According\nto The Guardian, \u201cinstead of heeding\nthe evidence of the research they were\nfunding,majoroilfirmsworkedtogether\nto bury the findings and manufacture\na counter-narrative to undermine the\ngrowing scientific consensus around\nclimate science.\u201d As recently as 2020,\nImperial researchers collaborated with\nresearchers at ExxonMobil to create a\nmembrane to refine oil more efficiently.\nAfter a temporary dip in sponsorship\nduring the pandemic, funding has\nbounced back rapidly over the last year.\nWomen in SET has seen its number of\nsponsors double since the pandemic,\nand the society has no intention to\nstop expanding.

While those\nat Imperial Climate Action are calling\nfor the College and the student union\nto mandate ethical consideration\nbefore accepting sponsorship deals,\nleadership at these professional societies\nappear to take a different view. Their\ngoal is to connect students to jobs and\nfuture success, not supress those same\nopportunities.\n...continued from page 1\nDebating the ethics\nOn Wednesday, the College\nannounced plans to establish\na research hub with Nanyang\nTechnological University (NTU),\nspanningmultidisciplinarytechnologies.\nThe NTU-Imperial Health,\nSustainability and Technology Hub\nwill focus on collaborating in \u201cresearch,\neducation, innovation and enterprise\u201d,\nand work on integrating artificial\nintelligence into healthcare solutions,\ncreating minimally polluting cities,\nand creating solutions to some of the\nproblems facing humanity.\nNTU is a Singaporean university\nestablished in 1991, and was listed by\nQS Rankings as the 5th-best Asian\nuniversity this year.

    "content": "When photography was invented in the mid-nineteenth century, it was lauded as an\nincredible new tool for delivering truth. It took\nseveral decades for it to be lauded as an incredible\nnew avenue for delivering art, where it joined the\ntraditional methods in a discipline which has a much\nmore complicated relationship with truth, due to the\nunfortunate necessity of a subjective creator. Film\nsuffers from a similar complexity of realism. Jean-Luc\nGodard once said, \u201cPhotography is truth. Cinema is\ntruth at twenty-four frames per second.\u201d I say, \u201cNice\nline, Jean-Luc, but that depends on your definition of\ntruth.\u201d\nAs a storytelling medium, when compared to\nothers, it could be argued that films present us with\nthe best opportunity for accurately portraying real\nlife. When you read a book, you fill in the sensory gaps\nwith your own imagination. A film has the ability to\nprovide those sensory experiences for you. However,\nthat also means that it has very little to hide behind\nwhen it fails to deliver them convincingly. The clearest\npillars on which the sense of authenticity rests are the\nperformances of the actors and the dialogue between\nthem. This is also the most obvious point at which\nthat same sense of realism can collapse; if an actor\nisn\u2019t convincing enough in the role, or if the dialogue\nfeels heavy and unnatural, we notice, and that tends to\nnegatively impact our immersion in the story.\nWhen I recently watched The Worst Person in The\nWorld for the first time, I was struck by how authentic\nthe film felt to me. By authentic, I mean realistic \u2014 the\ncharacters and story transcended fiction and seemed\nlike real people. It felt like life. A large part of that, I\nthink, was due to the performances of the main cast,\nand specifically the performance of Renate Reinsve as\nthe main character Julie.\nActors are often celebrated and awarded for their\nability to throw themselves into a role, to portray\npowerful and explosive emotions, or to transform\nthemselves into a real historical figure. These abilities\nare by no means undeserving of celebration, but I\nthink sometimes a different type of performance can\nbeevenmore\u2018convincing\u2019.InTWPITW,Julieisnotan\nincredibly complex character, nor does she often have\nhugeoutpouringsofemotion.She\u2019scaughtbetweenher\ntwenties and her thirties, and feeling adrift in herself,\nher relationships, and the world around her. She\u2019s just\na regular person. What I find interesting is the extent\nto which Renate Reinsve disappears into that regular\nperson, becomes her, and convinces you beyond doubt\nthat she exists.\nFilms, much like real life relationships, are all\nabout communication. The communication of\nstory, of emotion, of ideas. An awful lot of human\ncommunication takes place outside of language\n\u2014 the spaces between words that have their own\nimplicit meaning, dependent on the context and the\nrelationships of the people communicating. Real life,\nand real relationships, are as much about what isn\u2019t\nsaid as what. And the things that we don\u2019t say with\nour words, we tend to reveal with our faces. The whole\nreason we have so many facial muscles to begin with is\nso that we can display such complex emotions. I\u2019m not\nan actor, but I think it\u2019s clear that being in full control\nof all those muscles isn\u2019t necessarily the goal \u2014 it\u2019s\nthe ability to feel the emotions that your character is\nfeeling that is the key to authentic performance. That\u2019s\nexactly how Renate Reinsve convinces us of Julie\u2019s\nexistence;notjustinthedialogue,butintheincredibly\nintricate,andreal,emotionsthatsheconveysinasingle\nexpression. Actors that can deliver powerful, intense\nperformances,wheretheemotionsburstforthfromthe\nphysiologicaldam\u2014thesemakeyoustandupandtake\nnotice (sometimes for a whole seven minutes, if you\u2019re\nin the audience at Cannes). But sometimes, being able\nto see someone try to hold back that emotion, and a\nthousand other conflicting emotions besides, can be\nfar more moving.\nIt\u2019s impossible to properly discuss performance\nwithout discussing dialogue. Film dialogue is\ninherently unrealistic, since it isn\u2019t really spoken at\nall. It\u2019s written on a MacBook Pro in an expensive\ncaf\u00e9 in Brooklyn. People don\u2019t say things as\npoetically or succinctly as they do in films,\nthey stutter and umm and ahh their way\nthrough a poorly crafted sentence that\ndoesn\u2019t really end up making the point\nthey intended to make to begin with. Of\ncourse, during actual production, a lot of\nactors and directors will work together to\nmake the dialogue feel more realistic, but\nyou can still tell when things feel slightly\nout of place. In The Worst Person in The\nWorld the characters are Norwegian, and\nI think that plays a part in why I found\nthe film to be so authentic. When you\nwatch a film in a language that you\nspeak, you\u2019re always unconsciously\nlistening out for odd nuances in the\ndialogue that sound unnatural. I don\u2019t\nspeak Norwegian, so I have absolutely\nno reference for how natural or\nunnatural the dialogue sounded \u2014\nnot just the content, but the cadence\nand word stresses are completely distinct from English.\nI think that I would judge the content of the subtitles\nless readily. The presence of subtitles, too, might\nencourage someone to pay more attention to the film,\nand thus become naturally more invested in it. A lot\nof information about a character can be conveyed by\nthe way they speak, but watching a film in a language\nthat you don\u2019t speak, you miss a lot of that nuance.\nIn this way, I think not understanding the language\nisn\u2019t necessarily something that heightens a feeling of\nrealism, but perhaps something which can mask a lack\nthereof.\nThere\u2019s also another point: whether or not a film\nneeds to feel authentic. You have the obvious example\nof elements of fantasy in genre films, but also a lot of\nwriters and directors of any genre will deliberately\navoid pursuing a sense of realism in their story, or in\ntheir dialogue, for the sake of invoking a different\ntheme or emotional response that supports the art that\nthey\u2019re trying to create. The dialogue in your average\nWes Anderson film is far from realistic, but that\u2019s part\nof what makes his films so engaging.\nIfI\u2019mbeinghonest,though,Ithinkalargepartofany\nperceived authenticity is just that \u2014 perceived. Film is\nsubjective; the meaning of a scene might be intended\none way, and interpreted another depending on the\nprojection of the person viewing it. The same is most\nlikelytrueforrealism.ThefilmtracksJulie\u2019suncertainty\nas she moves from twenty to thirty. As someone who is\nalso rapidly moving in that same direction, I\u2019m\nbound to find more \u201ctruth\u201d in such a\ndepiction, especially a deliberately\nemotionally charged one. That\nis to say, make up your own\nmind \u2014 as with anything\nelse in film, I might love\nit, and you might think\nit\u2019s a tremendous pile\nof unrealistic garbage.\nHow do films create truth?\nFRIDAY 2ND DECEMBER 2022\nEdited by: Jonah Hewett\nMike Buzadji\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk 11\nJonah Hewett Film Editor\nA brief discussion of realism in film, using a case study of The Worst Person in The World by Joachim Trier\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n6\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCould the development of bioinformatics lead us toward a future\nwhere we coexist with clones of our-selves? Imagine a world of super-com-puters that can scan and make an exact\ncopy of your brain, and then transfer\nall the information into a new physical\nbody that is exactly like yours. There will\nbe two of you in the world.\nThe clone is exactly like you, they\npossess all the skills, knowledge,\nexperiences, and personalities you\nhave and harnesses all what makes you\nunique. They are also self-conscious,\nacknowledging the fact they are a clone.\nThe clone has the same family relatives,\nsuch that your relationships are also\ntheirs. All in all, the clone is a perfect\ncopy of you.\nNow, the question is, which one is\nmore valuable; the clone or the original?\nAs an example, imagine that you make\na businessman choose between his\nParker pen, with which he signed up\nimportant business contracts, and a\nnew Parker, which shares the same\nmodel. Considering that his old Parker\nis completely functional as a new one,\nthe person would choose the old Parker\nbecause such Parker remembers him\nof his crucial past events, even if both\nParkers are technically the same. If your\nmother was the judge, she would surely\nchoose you. Even though the clone is\nexactly identical to you and also feels\nthe same connection with your mother,\nthe bonding of your mother with you is\nmuch stronger because those shared life\nexperiences were between your mother\nand you, not with the clone. Your\nmother feels a stronger attachment to\nyou, the original.\nLet's take the case where the judge is\nan stranger with no relationship to you.\nThe choice between the clone and you\nnow becomes less obvious. You might\nargue that the original is better. Why?\nTake Google, for example. Google was\nnot the first search engine in the world,\nbut it is currently the most popular one\nbecause Google made improvements\non earlier search engines. It is true,\nhowever, that intuitively we think the\noriginal is better than the clone. From\na stranger\u2019s perspective, the reason is\nthat we subconsciously assume that\nthe clone, the copy, is inherently worse\nthan the original. Perhaps humans are\nnaturally programmed to value original\nthings because these must be created\nfrom scratch, without any template,\nwhich is much harder than just copying\nfrom the original, ignoring the fact that\nmost copies usually have additional\nimprovements from the original. Note\nthat this is only from a third party\u2019s\nperspective; your mother will be heavily\nbiased to choose you before the clone.\nIn addition, humans tend to value the\nhistory of things, this is why many old\npaintings have astronomically high\nvalues, but copies of those paintings are\nfar less.\nTo add more complexity to the topic,\nw h a t\nhappens when you die and your clone is\nstill alive? What are the limitations for\nthe clone not being able to replace you?\nIntheend,theclonehasyourpersonality\nand memories. The clone will treat your\nmother the same as you will treat her.\nWhy should she not accept a clone\ninsteadofyou,whoisnolongeronEarth?\nIn the case that your mother does not\naccepttheclone,thisisproofthatshared\nexperiences are more important than the\nphysical body and even personality of\nthe person. In the opposite case, where\nyour mother accepts the clone, this will\nshow that you are replaceable, and that\nyou are no longer unique. The reason\nfor the mother to choose the clone\ninstead of her original child might be\nfor emotional consolation. It would be\nextremely difficult for the mother not\nto accept the clone as he behaves and\nspeaks exactly as you would. Also, it\nis challenging for your mother to keep\nactively thinking two contradictory\nthings: \u201cMy son is dead\u201d, and \u201cthe\nperson in front of me who is exactly\nlike my dead son is not him but a clone\u201d.\nEven for the most traumatic of events\nlike the betrayal of a friend, we are not\nconstantly remembering that betrayal\nfor the rest of our lives. Our brains tend\nto bury the past, especially unpleasant\nmemories. We move on and make new\nfriends.\nAll the topics discussed previously are\nmainly theoretical but it is important\nto reflect on the value of individuals,\nparticularly in a world where computers\nare taking over work that was previously\ndone by. It makes us wonder if we are\ntruly indispensable for the proper\nfunctioning of our own society if we are\nreplaceable, not necessarily by a clone,\nbut by machines in general.\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nEdited by: angie lo\ntaylor pomfret\nScience\nClone or no clone?\nWhat if we lived alongside clones of ourselves?

The composer,\nwho lived within walking distance of\nImperial for a significant portion of his\nlife, originally composed this work for\nthe Three Choirs Festival of 1912. The\nFantasia intertwines well-loved tunes,\nincluding the Sussex and Somerset\ncarols, and clearly reflects Williams\u2019\nlove of the festival of Christmas. Our\nperformance, featuring baritone soloist\nPeter Edge and orchestra, promises to\nraise your spirits before the final week of\nterm \u2013 even if you have exams.\nDuring the concert on 10th December\nheld in Holy Trinity Church (adjacent\nto Beit), the Choir will also be singing\nselectedcarolsconductedbyourassistant\ndirector, Max Bennett. This follows our\ntube station caroling in previous weeks\nraisingmoneyforHealthPovertyAction\nand COSMIC (Caring for Babies and\nChildren in Intensive Care).\nTo finish off our repertoire for\nthis concert, Imperial College Choir\nalso presents Franz Joseph Haydn\u2019s\n'Harmoniemesse'. Consisting of six\nmovements, this mass is Haydn\u2019s last\nmajor work written at the ripe age of\n70. It opens with a broad, slow and\nsupplicant Kyrie, full of dark chromatic\nchords and richly contrasting orchestral\ntextures. The Gloria is in three sections,\nconcluding with a glorious Quoniam\ndouble fugue of \u2018In gloria Dei patris\u2019\nand \u2018Amen\u2019, whilst the following Credo\nis in three sections with a short fourth.\nPerhaps the most striking feature of the\nwhole work is the magical effect Haydn\nachieves by using the relatively distant\nkey of G major for the serene hymn-like melody of the Agnus Dei. Peace\nis demanded in the final movement\n\u2018Dona nobis pacem\u2019 with that mixture\nof exuberance and aggressiveness so\ntypical of his music. The choir will be\njoined by soloists Peter Edge, Sam Utley,\nHolly Teague and Taryn Surratt. Both\nfeatured works will be accompanied by\nan orchestra and conducted by Dr Colin\nDurrant who has been conducting\nchoirs since the age of 15 \u2013 apparently,\nthis was a very long time ago.\nLooking ahead to next term, the\nChoir is excited to be performing\nVerdi\u2019s Requiem in collaboration with\nICSO on 18th March in Holy Trinity\nSloane Square.

That person may well be on\nthe Union Council, the democratically\nelected student body that represents the\ninterests of students. For most of the\nUnion\u2019s history the Union Council was\nthe ultimate decision-making body of\nthe Union, however bureaucratisation\nand professionalisation have meant\nthat this is no longer the case. The\nUnion Council, who vote on issues with\nabout as much principled direction as\na windsock, should not be given free\nreign of around \u00a310 million per year, it\nseems to have been decided over the past\ncouple of decades.\nAs a body, the council could\ntechnically vote for literally anything,\nfrom facetious suggestions such as\nspending the entire annual budget on\nramen, to more realistic ones such as\nre-joining the NUS. Nowadays, rather\nthan obliging the Union to carry out\nwhatever actions have been approved,\na council vote often just means that the\nstudent body\u2019s opinion is thus. Any\ndecision that could negatively effect\nthe Union financially, reputationally\nor otherwise, can be overridden by the\nboard of trustees.\nHistory\nThe Union was founded in 1911 when\nits first set of bye-laws were passed by\nthe Governing Body of Imperial College\nLondon. The construction of the Union\nBuilding was finished the same year\n(though only two floors tall at that\npoint). Until 1981, membership of ICU\nwas male-only, and women students\nwere instead members of the Imperial\nCollege Women\u2019s Association, or ICWA\n(pronounced ik-wa). Furthermore, the\nUnion Bar (the one at the northeast\ncorner of Beit Quad, not 568) was male\nonly until 1972, with ICWA members\ninstead offered the \u201cICWA lounge\u201d.\n568 used to be called \u201cda Vinci\u2019s\u201d and\nMetric used to be called \u201cdb\u2019s\u201d (short for\n\u201cDecibel\u2019s\u201d;howthingscomefullcircle).\nSatisfaction\nThe Union is consistently the worst-performing aspect of Imperial College\nLondon, as covered by the National\nStudent Survey of final year students\neach year. When asked whether ICU\neffectively represents their academic\ninterests, only a 58% responded\npositively in 2021 and 2022 (compared\nto 82% overall satisfaction in 2022).\nSatisfaction with the Union hit a trough\nin 2019 with a rate of just 51%.\nSupport\nThe Union has an award-winning advice\nservice that has been totally transformed\nin the last couple of years. They can offer\nadvice on academic and disciplinary\nissues, as well as point you in the right\ndirection if you have financial trouble\nor wish to lodge a complaint.

This is supposed to be a brief\nexplainer on the enigmatic body that\nlooks after student activities, welfare,\neducational lobbying and a number of\nthe bars.\nWhat is a Students\u2019 Union?\nSUs became a mandatory requirement\nfor all institutions of higher education\nfollowing the ascent into law of the\n1994 Education Act, which defined\nan SU as \u201ca representative body (or\nan association of the generality of\nstudents) whose principal purposes\ninclude representing the generality\nof students at an establishment...\nin academic, disciplinary or other\nmatters relating to the government of\nthe establishment.\u201d Imperial College\nUnion is a registered charity, as of 2012,\nand has as its charitable purpose \u201cthe\nadvancement of education of students at\nImperial College London for the public\nbenefit by: promoting the interests\nand welfare of students at Imperial\nCollege London during their course of\nstudy and representing, supporting and\nadvising students; being the recognised\nrepresentative channel between students\nand Imperial College London and any\nother external bodies; and providing\nsocial,cultural,sportingandrecreational\nactivities and forums for discussions and\ndebate for the personal development of\nits students.\u201d Thus, the justification for\nthe Union\u2019s existence is that it supports\nYOU during your time at the College.\nMoney, money, money\nAs a registered charity, ICU is\nobliged to report financial data to the\nCharity Commission, who make this\ninformation available, for all charities,\nfor the previous five years. As can be\nseen in the accompanying graph, income\ntook quite a hit in the period of July\n2019 - July 2020, and even more so July\n2020 - July 2021. Whilst detail on this is\nscant, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that\na pandemic forcing all bars to close for\nmonths on end has a negative effect on\ntheir finances.\nEach year the Union received a \u201cblock\ngrant\u201d from the College, averaging\naround \u00a33 million over the last few years\n(from your tuition fees). The block grant\ncovers things like salaries of permanent\nstaff and operational costs such as IT.\nFurther money is earned from the bars,\nevent sales and room bookings (see the\nBBC set up shop on the first floor every\nyear for a couple of weeks to host the\nProms).\nManagement and Governance\nWhenanorganisationbecomesacharity\nit must appoint a board of trustees\nto oversee the charity\u2019s operation in\na non-executive fashion. ICU has 16\ntrustees, six of whom are \u201clay trustees\u201d,\nprofessionals from without the Union\nor College who have a philanthropic\ninterest in the Union doing well. Further\nto these people, the President and\nDeputy Presidents make up five more\ntrustees, alongside the Council Chair\nand four student trustees.\nOn the executive side, 61 staff\nmembers allow the Union to operate\nall the services it provides. At the top of\nthis ladder, bar reporting to the trustees,\nis Tom Newman, Managing Director\nsince October 2022. Thanks to finicky\nemployment laws, Tom is the only\nmember of permanent Union staff that\nFelix is allowed to name in print - we can\nmention the actions of all departments\nand groups within the Union, but\nmaking any individual member of staff\nidentifiable could land the paper, and\nthe Union, in legal hot water.\nThe previous Managing Director was\npaid somewhere between \u00a390k and\n\u00a3100k per year - an amount so high\nthat the charity commission deems it\nobligatory to share publicly (all salaries\npaid by charities over \u00a360k). Similarly,\ntwo other members of staff, presumably\ntwo other members of the management\nteam, are paid between \u00a360k and \u00a370k\neach.\nThe President and each of the Deputy\nPresidents, as well as the ICSMSU\nPresident, are paid \u00a335,477 per year,\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n4\nImperial College Unio\nSam Lovatt Managing Editor\nUnion President candidates do a pint race at their hustings\nBeit Quad used to host tennis courts\nFinancial data of ICU for the last five years - green is total expenditure, purple is gross income\n\n"

How do you like London so\nfar? Have you crossed some attractions\nin London off your list? Have you got a\nchance to visit Trafalgar Square?\nA public square which is home to\nstatues and monuments. One of the\nmost notable is a column where the\nstatue of Lord Horatio Nelson stands\ntall. Lord Nelson, dressed in a vice-admiral undress coat, has visible battle\nscars: amputated left arm and blind eye\nfrom the battles he had fought. In fact,\nTrafalgar Square commemorates the\nBattle of Trafalgar and Lord Nelson,\nwhose life was lost in the crossfire.\nOn Saturday 22nd October 2022,\n217 years and one day after The Battle\nof Trafalgar, Imperial History Society\nwent on a trip to the National Maritime\nMuseum in Greenwich, 45 minutes\nfrom South Kensington station. After\nabout 10 minutes' walk past the lively\nGreenwich Market, we arrived at the\nmuseum. A beautiful classic UNESCO\nWorldHeritagebuildingstandingstrong\nand elegant in the middle of the green,\nneatly-cut grass field, with autumnal\nleaves on the ground complimenting the\nscene, as if this was a lifesize painting\nitself.\nWe spent a few hours inside the\nmuseum,which was hosting a bright\ncelebration of Diwali on the day. Among\nthe first few rooms on the ground floor,\nwe visited a room where The Battle of\nTrafalgar,thebiggestpaintingbyfamous\nBritishartistJ.M.W.Turner,isexhibited.\nHave you ever experienced that moment\nwhen you lay your eyes on something so\ncaptivating that you cannot take your\neyes off of it, as if it absorbs you into it?\nThis painting affected me that way.\nThe accompanying photograph\ndoesn\u2019t come close to doing the real\npainting justice. What stood out to me\nare the depths of the painting being\nshown by layers of ships, the smoke\nfrom gunpowder that fades and blends\ninto clouds and people in the middle\nfront, setting the mood and tone of the\noverall painting. J. M. W. Turner was\ncommissioned to capture this important\nmoment in British history in one\npainting. Thus, he merged all moments\nfrom several days of this battle into\none scene, in what became a timeless\nmasterpiece. Just like Trafalgar Square,\nthis painting was also another token of\ntheBattleof Trafalgar,whichremindsus\nof the event even today.\nUp on the second floor, the highlight\nof the trip is on display: the exhibition\nshowing why the Battle of Trafalgar is so\nsignificant to the history of the United\nKingdom. According to Encyclopedia\nBritannica, the event \u201cestablished\nBritish naval supremacy\u201d as it stopped\nNapoleon's attempt to invade England.\nDespite being outnumbered by the fleets\nof France and Spain combined, Lord\nNelson\u2019s tactics led England to victory.\nThe Battle of Trafalgar\nThe Battle was fought in 1805 at\nthe cape of Trafalgar, Spain. British\nships were clearly outnumbered by the\nFranco-Spanish fleet. Nelson led Britain\nto win this war using innovative tactics.\nHere is how he did it.\nNelson waited for the Franco-Spanish\nfleet to sail as far from the land as\npossible to prevent them from retreating\nto recoup and re-arm. Normally, any\nfleet would just approach the enemy and\nstart a shooting match. Instead of using\ntraditional tactics, Nelson ordered the\nfleet to split into two lines to attack the\nfoe from a perpendicular angle. Lord\nNelson himself was leading the North\nfleet on board HM Victory.\nOff the coast of cape Trafalgar and\nabout five kilometres away from the\nenemy fleet, Nelson disseminated one\nof the most famous messages in military\nhistory: \u201cEngland expects that every\nman will do his duty.\u201d\nAn inevitable challenge for any\nship is nature. The wind situation for\nNelson\u2019s North fleet was unfavourable\nfor the British navy, thus, he ordered\na fake maneuver, deceiving the enemy\nto think it was forming a line. Instead,\nHM Victory got between two of the\nFrench ships, allowing her to use guns\non both sides. The French ships, on the\nother hand, needed to turn in order to\nuse the guns. Therefore, the time taken\nto turn the ship was detrimental for the\nenemy fleet. Other British ships came in\nto support HM Victory, take down and\ncapture the Franco-Spanish fleet.\nAt the end, the Allied flagships\nsurrendered. The British navy won the\nBattle of Trafalgar, but Lord Nelson lost\nhis life to the battle after being shot by a\nsniper.\nLord Nelson became an icon and was\nan inspiration to many. Obviously, the\ntactics that he had used were considered\nto be innovative and brave. It was\ndiscussed among historians that in the\nbattle, Nelson was a frequently visible\ntargetfortheenemymarksmen;hestood\nat the helm and wore his full military\noutfit and led the charge, defining his\nleadership style. In fact, the phrase\n\u2018turn a blind eye\u2019 which is commonly\nused as an idiom for pretending to not\nsee something originated from Lord\nNelson himself. During the Battle in\nCopenhagen (1801), Nelson was told\nto withdraw his fleet but he believed\nthat it was unnecessary. Therefore, he\npretended to not see the withdrawal\nsignals by putting his looking glass to his\nblinded eye.\nWhat are we left with?\nI find it hard to consider Nelson a\nhero today due to his strong support\nfor colonialism. Still, the fact that he\nwas loved and respected during his life\nmight be based on the context of the\ntimes he lived in. Putting ourselves in\ntheir shoes, society back then was not\nused to differences. When people are\nunfamiliar with something, they doubt,\nfear and attach some negative feelings to\nit. What was the context of our world\nbefore globalisation? However, just\nlike an unfinished book, history can be\ninterpreted uniquely by each person. I\nhope that after reading this article, if you\ngotoTrafalgarSquareduringChristmas,\nyou will feel a little bit different one way\nor another.\nSome people view history as art and\nentertainment, which is not entirely\nwrong. Still, I think we all could be\nmore well-rounded world citizens if\nwe are open to the not-so-beautiful\nside of history. Not just the Battle of\nTrafalgar or Lord Nelson as a person,\neverywhere you go, there have been\npeople experiencing the same place in a\ndifferent way, at a different time. Some\nparts of history might make you feel\nuncomfortable, but it is important to\nknow how the world came to be what\nit is today. I hope learning history will\nhelp you better understand your friends,\nunderstand your differences and accept\neach other as who we genuinely are.\nI hope learning history can break the\nfrozen sea inside you.\nBibby Phukthuanthong\nIC History Society\n\n"

    "content": "When it comes to marketing, information is king.\nBecause of the sheer complexity of the\ncustomerjourney,brandsmusttakeastepbacktoreview\nhowcustomersreacttotheirproductsandhowtheycan\noptimise. This is achieved through advertisement. The\nmore marketers know about customer behaviours, the\nmore likely their next advertisement will be relevant,\nsubtle, and thus effective.\nAdvertisement involves a process called attribution.\nIt describes how marketing strategies and subsequent\ncustomer interactions contributed to the marketer\u2019s\nobjectives. Attribution can be as simple as analysing\none touchpoint, or as complex as mapping the entire\ncustomer journey. Ultimately, marketers use these\nattributiontechniquestofindtheoptimal,cost-effective\nstrategy to maximise ROI (return on investment).\nThere are two main types of attribution strategies, client-side attribution and server-side attribution.\nClient-side tracking is also known as pixel tracking.\nA tracking pixel is an HTML code snippet which is\nloaded when a user visits a website. With a tracking\npixel, advertisers can acquire data on user behaviours\non websites. This solution used to be affordable. All\nmarketers needed to do was create a Facebook page\nabout their products, and monitor the data collected by\nFacebook. Facebook would do the rest by identifying\nthe optimal user group, marketing to them and then\nproducing attribution analytics reports for marketers\nProblem arises...\nHowever, this process is no longer easy since 2020. In\n2020, Apple changed its privacy policy regarding third-party tracking and reduced the volume of conversion\ndata marketers have historically had access to. What\u2019s\nmore, both Safari and Firefox adopted\nIntelligent Tracking Prevention, which\nprevented cross-site tracking and limited\nthe efficacy of cookies. Meanwhile, the\naverage global ad-blocking rate at the end\nof 2020 was 42.7%. Now marketers are\nno longer be able to identify customers,\nacquire some of their desired data, or\nunderstand the intention behind each\naction. As a result, marketers\u2019 customer\nacquisition cost, a key measure of\nmarketing efficiency, hiked.\nSuddenly, attribution is a problem for\neverybody.\nPlatforms like Facebook are still able to\ntarget users based on data they collected\nbefore, but these data will quickly lose\nvalue. It will also be increasingly difficult\nfor Facebook to take credit because of the difficulty in\nproviding a detailed report on how well the ads work.\nAs a result, more than 60% of e-commerce store owners\ncut their marketing spending on Facebook. Businesses\nwhich relied heavily on digital marketing were severely\nhurt. Loose-leaf tea seller Plum Deluxe used to gain a\nnew customer for every $27 it spent on Facebook and\nInstagram ads. Now it spends as much as $270 to pick\nup a new customer.\nIn comparison, server-side attribution can detour\nfrom it.\nThis is how it works. When a user clicks on a tracking\nlink, a unique identifier is generated and stored. This\nunique ID includes information such as browser,\nlocation, operating system, internet service provider,\netc. When the conversion happens, the same unique\nID will be pulled out to match the initial click with the\nfinal conversion. Meanwhile, the marketing channels\nsend back the value along with the unique ID.\nBy not using browser tracking, no client-side data\nprocessing is required. In other words, even if users opt-out of cookies, marketers will remain in control. Serverside tracking is an essential component of consistent\nfirst-party data management, which is becoming\nincreasingly popular in the industry as an alternative to\nthird-party data.\nMost ad tech companies were established before\nApple or regulators renewed their privacy policies.\nIt takes time for\nthem to transform\nand adapt to this\nchanging landscape\nof privacy-preserving\na d v e r t i s e m e n t .\nSome conglomerates\nstepped in to raise\ntheir solutions, such as\nFacebook Conversion\nAPI and Google\nPrivacy Sandbox.\nYet, there is a huge\nmarket gap, and\nConversion Pattern,\nled by Jonathan\nAeschlimann, came\nin to grasp the\nopportunity.\nUncover Customer Journey with Conversion Pattern\nAccording to Jonathan, a key issue with existing\nproducts is that they cannot adapt to the problem\ninduced by reduced available data. That is, they cannot\ndistinguish who the website visitor is. With Conversion\nPatterns, marketers can understand everything that\nhappens before their customers\u2019 1st purchase, and make\ndecisions about which campaigns to focus on, where to\nsave money, which channel is the most effective, etc.\nHow does it work?\nIn the first stage, Conversion Pattern enables the use\nof first-body data and identifies if the user has been to\nthe website before using its Identity Resolution Engine.\nThen, it recovers any user IDs that were previously\ndefined. This way, when a user converts, the Facebook/\nGoogle/etc pixel will recognise that the visitor is the\nsame visitor that previously clicked on an ad and will\nmanage to associate the sale with the click, making the\nsale reflect on advertising campaigns.\nIn the second stage, it activates the data through\nserver-side attribution. One way is to send the collected\ndata directly back to advertising channels, which can\nbe Facebook, Tiktok, you name it. This way, it helps\nimprove marketing in real-time. And then the other\nside of it, Conversion Pattern sends the data to the\nclient companies\u2019 data warehouse for further analytics\npurposes.\nTips for rookie entrepreneurs: MAKE SUCCESS\nATTAINABLE\nFinally, on the behalf of student entrepreneurs, we\nasked Jonathan for one piece of advice he would give to\nfirst-time entrepreneurs.\n\u201cPerhaps unlike what others would say, I would\nsuggest finding something that is easier for you to\nsucceed in. Because if you try to solve a very complex\nproblem with the first shot, most people will be\ndemotivated soon. Making success attainable and\ngetting the momentum is important.\u201d\n\u201cEven if you do not come from that particular\nbackground, don\u2019t be shy to read deep into something.\nPrediction and AI-empowered industries have huge\npotential and market gaps. Explore it!\u201d\nIn this evolving landscape of privacy-preserving\ninternet, what difficulties do startups face and what\nopportunities are present?
