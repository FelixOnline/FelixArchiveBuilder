    "content": "13\nBoat\nBonanza?\nDear Sir,\nI have been most\nconcerned by articles and\nletters in the two most recent\neditions of FELIX (710 and\n711) dealing with two of IC's most successful clubs. On\nthe one hand, the Boat Club\nhas received an unexpected\nand, I believe, un war rented boost in the shape of a new\nboat, while Industrial Society\nhas been subjected to a concerted attack from this\nand last year's Exec.\nTo deal with the Boat Club\nfirst, I would ask this - Why\nshould Boat Club, a relatively\nsmall though highly\nsuccessful group, receive an\neffective \u00a36,000 extra next\nyear when many clubs, with\nfar more members, are faced\nwith severe cash shortages?\nIn these times of financial\npressures I accept that cut\nbacks have to be made, but\nthe whole exercise seems\npointless when the money\nleft over from the last year,\nwhich was meant to pay for\nthis year's \u00a34,000 shortfall,\ngets blown on a \u00a36,000 boat.\nWhere's all the money\ncoming from? With the\nridiculous end of year claw-back of un spent money in\nthe MSC's you expect some\nspending sprees, but this\ndemonstrates how ludicrous\nthe system really is! I trust\nhowever, that the current IC\nUnion Exec will have the\ngood sense to veto this\nfarewell gift of Ian Bull's to\nACC.\nAnd so to a more serious\nmatter, not least because\nINDSOC's membership is\nclose to a thousand. Imperial\nCollege Industrial Society,\nalmost uniquely among\nUnion Clubs, actually\nache ives something useful.\nAs a result of these\nindustrial contacts, INDSOC\nalso makes a sizeable\namount of money for itself,\nthrough donations and fair\nstall charges. This money is\npaid to the Industrial Society\nand placed in their account.\nThis is the only money that\ngoes into the account - no\nmembership fees, and no\nUnion money. The Union,\never on the want for more\nfunds,eyes this account\ngreedily and wants to\nintegrate it with the S CC account. However, this\nmoney is given to INDSOC\nby Industry for their use. Not\nto spend on, for example,\nCND SOC going \u00a3300 over\nbudget on useless films! If\nthe companies found that\ntheir money was not being\nspent on what was intended,\nit is very likely that the\nmoney will be withdrawn.\nAnd where will we all be\nthen? As for the account\nbeing uncontrolled and\nun audited, I have been\nassured by certain INDSOC\ncommittee members that\nsome of the country's most\npre sti go us accountancy firms\nwould be only too happy to\nprovide their services, free of\ncharge! As it stands, the\nUnion is likely to lose a great\ndeal of good will, and a great\ndeal of money as well. I only\nhope that the Exec consider\nthe position very carefully.\nDave Clements - SCC\nMiscellaneous Clubs Rep.\nthe Union Office. I welcome\ncorrespondence particularly\nfrom IndSoc members.\nYours annoyed,\nDavid Green.\nRisky\nRag\nIndsoc\nBore\nDear Sir,\nI have just obtained a copy\nof FELIX 711 containing half\nof my last letter on the\nsubject of IndSoc's finances.\nMay I say that it only needed\nto be 'epic' as a result of the\nmany errors and\nmisrepresentations in your\nprevious article and editorial.\nIt was a serious attempt to\nredress these points and was\ntreated with contempt. In\nfuture, I will think again\nbefore deciding that the\nFELIX Letter Page is a suitable medium for\ndiscussing the subject.\nMeanwhile, I would be more\nthan happy to answer\nquestions, criticisms and\npoints of view from anyone\nwho cares to write to me via\nDear Editor,\nWhen Aston University's student newspaper printed\nan article making fun of the\nBradford football fire, just a few weeks ago, this was\nreported prom in ant ly in the\nGuardian, Daily Mail, The\nTimes, The Daily Express,\nThe Birmingham Post and\nthe Birmingham Evening Mail\n\u2014 as well as the Bradford\nTelegraph and Argus. With\nheadlines such as\n'Degrading, Despicable and\nDisgusting' and even a question in parliament to Mrs\nThatcher, is this really the\nsort of publicity Imperial\nCollege needs??\nAs for Rag Mag Editor\nTony Spencer's letter in the\nlast FELIX, I would like to\nsee him presenting the same\njustification to a relative of\none of the Bradford victims\nwhen they hear about this\nsick 'humour' \u2014 and from my\nexperience at Aston I can\nassure you that Bradford and\nthe rest of the country will\nhear about Mr Spencer.\nYours sincerely,\nJulian Rose\nAston University\n# Edi Executive\nWhen Carl Burgess, Dave\nKingston and Quentin\nFontana were elected,\nmany people predicted that\nthey would make a series\nof major cock-ups. These\npeoples' worst fears have\nbeen fulfilled. Incredibly,\nthey have managed to\nwaste over a thousand\npounds of Union funds\u2014a commodity in very short\nsupply\u2014by banning the\nRag Mag. Tony Spencer set\nout to produce a Rag Mag\nthat was 'over the top'. The\nsabbatical Union officers\nwere warned (see FELIX\n712) that the Rag Mag\nneeded to be edited\nseverely. However they\nfailed to do this. They\nfailed to do their job\nproperly.\nOver the summer Union\nsabbaticals are not over\nworked. On many days\nCarl, Dave and Quentin\nhave occupied themselves\nby playing Risk and doing\nthe Times crossword! Yet\nthey were unable to find\ntime to check the Rag Mag\nI0[III properly. Union Sabbaticals\nwere given the power to\nalter the Rag Mag to ensure\nthat it would not be\nbanned. It was the Union\nsabbaticals job to ensure\nthat IC Union had a Rag\nMag that was sufficiently\ntasteful to be sold. Their\nfailure to do this is going to\nprove expensive.\nIt must be said that\nQuentin had worked\nefficiently when one\nconsiders that he had little\nexperience of the way the\nUnion worked. Regretably,\nhowever, the banning of\nthe Rag Mag is not the only\ncock-up by Dave and Carl.\nCarl has already\ndeveloped a reputation in\nCollege for being an easily-ignored incompetent. He\nhas regularly turned up to\nimportant meetings with\ninfluential College officials\nnot knowing what is to be\ndiscussed. The Union is\nfailing to get its views, on\nissues such as teaching\nstandards, across. Much of\nthe hard work by last years\nsabbaticals and Union\nofficers is being wasted by\nCarl's appalling\nperformance. Furthermore\npeople trying to use the\nUnion office are sick of\nRCS hacks making\nnuisances of themselves.\nYet instead of chucking\nthem out, Carl merely\nencourages them.\nDave Kingston runs\naround like a mad man. He\npanics about people\nwasting fifty pence, yet he\nhas already managed to\nwaste over a thousand\npounds. He tries to shout at\npeople as a way of\nimposing his authority.\nAnyone with any self-respect laughs in his face.\nSo far the Union\nsabbaticals have muddled\nalong because they haven't been put under any\npressure. In just over two\nweeks time the College will\nbe full of new students.\nUnion Committees will\nbegin to meet. Carl's and\nDave's actions will be\nunder their scrutiny and\nthey are unlikely to be\nimpressed with their\nperformances to date.\nIf Carl and Dave don't get\ntheir acts together quickly\nthe Union will face\nchaos.\nGuilds\nHaving criticised someone I thought I ought I to praise\nsomeone. Symon Corns\nand Dave Page have\nworked really hard to\nensure Spanner appeared\nthis year. They have done a really good job.\nFELIX\nFreshers FELIX will be out\nin just over two weeks time.\nLetters, small ads, What's On entries, sports reports\nand club articles must be\nhanded into the office by\n12.30pm next Friday.

    "content": ". Rg Xm ccp1 Amandla\nRiverside\nArnandia is the cultural\nense mole of the African\nNational Congress. They\nwere formed just over five\nyears ago in Angola and\nhave since performed\nthroughout Africa and\nEurope.\nThe production is\nstunning. Music, dance and\npoetry are combined to\nshow how the suffering of\nthe African people in South\nAfrica and how the ANC will win. The music has\nstrong modern western\ninfluences \u2014 Electric\nguitars, for example, are\nused by the backing group\n\u2014 but remaining distinctly\nAfrican. The dance is\ntraditional and stunning.\nThe poetry can best be\ndescribed as powerful.\nMy only criticism of\nAmandla is that it tends at\ntimes to ram a political\nmessage down the\naudience's throats.\nEveryone in the audience is\nlikely to support the ANC yet Amandla insisted on\nmaking statements all\nevening. The performance\nwould have been more\neffective if the group had\nconcentrated on showing\nthe audience the cultural\nheritage of South Africa.\nChickenhawk\nRobert Mas\u00a9-i When Robert Mason\ndreamed of flying as a child\nhis dreams never included\nincompetent superiors and\na nightmare war fought to\nsave a country from its cw n inhabitants, but these\nthings were precisely what\nhe encountered in his year\nas a combat helicopter pilot\nin Vietnam.\nMason takes a strictly\nautobiographical approach\nto his subject and does not\nattempt to take an overview\nof the war but instead\nshows, in close detail, the\nreality of the war for him as\na participant. The book's focus follows Mason from\nflight-struck childhood\n(very briefly described) and\nthrough training before\nreaching Vietnam. Here the\nnewly qualified Mason\nlearns the tricks of combat\nflying; flying in formations\nwhere rotor tips are only a few feet apart, chopping\nthrough trees with his tail\nrotor and taking off in an\nuncontrolled spin to\nincrease power.\nChickenhawk never\nbecomes boring as might\nhave easily happened to a book with so much\nemphasis on the actual\nbusiness of flying because\nof the strong sense of story\nimposed by Mason's own\nprogress as an increasingly\ncompetent flyer and the\nparadoxical decline of his\nmind and morale.\nAlthough Mason seems\nreluctant to indulge in\ndetailed characterization\nhis gift for describing the\nincidents of war such as a mass execution he\nwitnesses and the captain\nwho is forced to order his\nown position bombed in an\nattempt to save his\ncommand for provides\nadequate compensation.\nAt times the sheer\ninsanity of the scenes\ndescribed recalls Catch-22,\nbut Mason does not aim for\nhumour and Chickenhawk\nis not a comic novel; if\nMason's war seems to be\nmad then it probably it was.\nBrewster's Millions\nRichard Pryor is a very\ntalented comedian. Films\nsuch as Richard Pryor Live\nin Concert have made him\na household name. To\nmany people, Richard\nPryor and Eddie Murphy\nare the only black\nAmerican com dian s. Unfortunately in this film\nPryor is not allowed to\nshine. A weak director and\npoor script manage to\nstiff le Pryor's natural\nability.\nThe plot is quite simple.\nMonty Brewster (Richard\nPryor) has to spend thirty\nmillion dollars in a month.\nUnfortunately he can't tell\nhis friends, gamble the\nmoney give it to charity etc.\nAs you can imagine\nBrewster has some fun en\nroute. A few of the scenes\nare very funny. However\nthe jokes become\nrep etat ive. When the film\nfinished I was amazed to\ndiscover it had only lasted\nabout one hundred\nminutes. It really did drag.\nIf you're a Trading Places\nfan then, you might like to\ngo to see this film. Much of\nthe humour is in that vein. I warn you though, that it is\nnowhere near as good.\nWhen Pierre\u2014Augustin\nCaron de Beaumarchais\nwrote La Follee Journee,\nou Le Marriage de Figaro in\n1778, it took him three\nyears to get the play\nMonty Brewster (Richard Pryor), Warren Cox (Stephen\nCollins) and Angela Drake (Lonette McKee) in a scene from\nthe dull film, Brewster's Millions. With excel lant shows like\nAmandla and More Bigger Snacks Now on the stage in\nLondon you've got to desperate to go and see this film\nperformed publicly. The\nauthorities were alarmed by\nthe political satire in the\npiece. Louis XV1, the then\nking of France, exclaimed\nwhen he read it 'This man\nmocks everything one\nshould respect in a government. This is\ndetestable it will never be\nperformed'.\nNozze di Figaro, Mozart's opera based on\nBeaumarchais's work, is\nnow performed regularly in\nall the world's leading\nopera houses. People\nregularly praise the work as\none of Mozart's finest\npieces of music. Rarely,\nthough, do people\na pre cia te the political\nmessage of the work. The\nnew adaptation of the work\nby Tony Britten and Nick\nBroadhurst manages to get\nMozart's message across.\nThe production is set in the\nsixties. As a result the\nhypo c racy appears to be\nfar more vivid then it ever\ndoes in traditional grand\nopera.\nThis is one of the best\npieces of theatre on in the\nWest End Stage at the\nmoment. A strong play and\nstrong acting combine to\nmake this production\nessential viewing. This isn't traditional grand opera, but\nit is an excel lant example\nof how opera can be\nadapted for a young\naudience used to modern\ntheatre.\nMore Bigger\nSnacks Now\nICA\nMore Bigger Snacks Now is\npart of Wipe That Smile, an\ninternational season of\nvisionary humour at the\nICA. The play contains\nmime with sound mimicry\nand words in a piece about\nmoney, miracles s nd poverty. Four desperate\npeople plan escape routes\nand fantasies from a dirty\nliving room, with it's encompassing everyday\npetty problems which feed\nfear and paranoia, in a surreal, brilliant and\ndazzling series of sudden\nemotional leaps and\nbreakneck comic routines.\nEverything is covered, from\nair travel and expensive\nholiday, to a religious\napparition and a very funny\nrestaurant sketch. Highly\nrecommended.\nRuns until 21 September\n8pm( Doors open 7.50pm) \u00a3 (ICA Day Pass 60p) Page 4 Friday 13th September 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "'Shocking and disgusting' Rag Mag banned\nExec Rag Mag Fiasco The 1985-86 Rag Mag has\nbeen banned. The Rag Mag\nwas in such bad taste it\nwould ruin the reputation of\nImperial College, the\nExecutive decided. Guilds\nPresident and Executive\nMember, Roger Preece told\nFELIX 'If we're not careful\nImperial will become more\nrenowned for it'sobs eni ties than it's excel lance'. The Union sabbaticals are\ngiven the power to edit the Rag\nMag and remove any jokes that\nmay be offensive. Union\nPresident, Carl Burgess, had the\nRag Mag he edited severely\ncensored. Mr Burgess was the\nonly sabbatical to read any of the\ncompleted artwork and he only\nchecked a proportion. The Union\nsabbaticals say that they trusted\nRag Mag Editor, Tony Spencer.\nThey say that Mr Spencer\nincluded jokes that he had been\ninstructed to remove. Mr Spencer\nsays, though, that only jokes that\nhave been included and he was\nasked to remove are in his\neditorial. Only Mr Burgess\nsuggested that he include them\nin his editorial.\nWithin hours of the Rag Mag's delivery on Tuesday, Mr Burgess\nrealised that the Rag Mag would\nhave to be banned. He told FELIX\nthat the Rag Mag was designed\nto shock rather then amuse. He\ndescribed it as 'shocking,\ndisgusting and appalling rubbish'.\nAn emergency Executive meeting\nwas called and the decision was\ntaken to ban the Rag Mag. Mr\nSpencer complained that Mr\nBurgess failed to give him time to\npresent his case. He says that at\n6.00pm he was instructed to go\nstraight to the Union office. As\nhe was about to go out for the\nevening, he couldn't go and so\nwas unable to present his case.\nAt the meeting The Executive\ndiscovered that not only was it\noffensive but it didn't give the\nprinter's address.

The\nExecutive were also trying to get\nthe printers to pay for having the\naddress added as the printers\nhad removed it from the artwork.\nMany members of Rag\nCommittee believe that the Rag\nMag isn't offensive. Rag\nChairman, Jon Ingham, said he\ndidn't find the publication\noffensive.\nThe Rag Mag was last banned\nin 1981. In that year aUG M decided the Rag Mag should be\nremoved from circulation. The\ndecision was later reversed, but\nrag lost a large amount of money\nthat year as a result.\nLate News\nThe Executive have decided to\nreprint some of the pages of the\nRag Mag with the offensive jokes\nremoved. This means that a new\nRag Mag may be available for\nFresher's Week. The cost of\nreprinting is unknown at present.\nTony Spencer is attempting to\nprevent the reprinting arguing\nthat the U GM will reverse the\nban.\nJ32^ ID 1\nCfi\nFree!
