After a promising start,\nCotter kicked a penalty to\ngive ICa3 point lead. This was soon followed by a fine\ntry by West which resulted\nfrom a previously untried\nmovement from our backs. A successful penalty attempt\nby ' Vets saw the half-timer\nscore to 7\u20143.\nWith the forwards winning\nonly a limited amount of\nball, the backs began to\nshow some flair. After a clean passing movement\nWilliams scored an excellent\ntry on the right wing. Taking on 2 men he kicked ahead,\nran through (a mass of\nopponents) and gathering\nthe ball, went over for a try. Shortly afterwards a crash movement by Gilbert\nled to a Cotter try, converted\nto give ICa173 lead. In the last 10 minutes,\nVets turned on the pressure\nand were rewarded with a consolation try. Another\nCotter penalty saw the final\nscore at 20\u20147, a good result\nfrom an entertaining match.\nThere is still room for\nimprovement, but the side\nshows great promise.\nOther results:-I C1st XV39, Esher3 rd4 IC 2 nd XV13, Esher4 th0 If any constituent college players want a Saturday game\nany week, then please let\nyour captain(s) know.

This consists of three forwards,\nfour halves, three backs and a goalkeeper.

Although the defence woke\nup after the interval, and\nbegan to play hockey, they\nbecame disheartened by the\ncontinued inability of the IC forwards to score. IC then\nwent three goals down.\nIn the last few minutes of\nthe game (due to the Umpire's generosity) IC scored a goal,\nwhich was contested even by\ntheir own (IC's) defence.

Sports editing\nDear Sir, \u2014 As the author\nof the article entitles 'Mud-free' which appeared in last\nweek's FELIX, I wish to\npoint out that the published\nitem bore little resemble n ce to the one originally submitted\nfor publication. The original\ncontained descriptions of two\nevents in which die Cross country Club had participated\nthe previous week. The featured article consisted of\na report on just one of\nthese events (the description\nof the other event was of equal length in the original,)\nand that was in an edited\nversion. I have it on good authority\nthat some of the other sports\narticles printed were also subjected to this form of\nguillotine editing, and in one\ncase in particular a report,,\nsubmitted was not published\nwhilst the soccer club had\ntwo articles on the sports\npage!)\nTh i'i devastating use of\nthe editorial Derogative makes\nabsolute nonsense of the\npolicy of ~ asking people to\nwrite reports for FELIX. The editor, Mr Dewey, must\nhave a deep contempt for IC sport men and their literary\nabilities, since the drastic\naction he takes regarding\narticles, is in order to\nconfine sport to one page in\nFELIX. Sport should have as many pages in FELIX, as is necessary i nord g:r. to\npublish all the submitted\nreports. This could be done\nwithout increasing the size of the paper, by removing several\nof the regular features in FELIX. By this I am refer ing to the 'What's on' pages and\nthe reviews pages, the latter\nbeing a pointless contribution\nto FELIX by self-styled\ncritics whose pretentious\njournalism is as justified\nas any claim I would make\nto be an Olympic athlete.\nReviews by better qualified\npeople can be found elsewhere,\nso why have them in F ELK? Thus, by the removal of\nthe pages occupied by these\nspace consuming topics,\nroom would be created for\nall articles in a virtually\nunedited form.\nYours in the hope that this\nletter is printed in an\nunedited form.\nA Davey\nCapt X Country\nPRO RBR EMS ST RAH LUNGI have.here Prof Bremssfcrahlung\nn rho is into science In ab icj way.\nTell us .Prof, about the ongoing\nscience Situation\nRight on Prof; I know many of\nour Listeners will want to\nknow the deep significance of\nyour researches to the\noverall astrological situation.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 especially the von Daniken\nhypo t be s is spiritual-energy wise and the. intimate syr n bios is with\nthe higher frequency planes o$ existance s if cuo iH on ii y is e \u2022 \u2022\n... but first we 90 to the phones]\nto speak to Arthur of/ Egba noob out h 'is trip to Venus in a Saturman flying saucer... j "

However, towards the\nend of the half IC settled down-and started to look dangerous\nwith a series of right wing\nassaults on the Kings' defence.\nFrom one such attack a diving attempt by Ian Huntingdon\nwent just wide.

From\nthis point IC did not look\nback, their lead was soon\nincreased when Steve Bates crossed the ball, again from\nthe right wing, and Gareth\nRoberts ghosted in at the\nnear post to score with a glancing header.\nIC continued to search\nfor goals and were unlucky not\nto increase their tally. One\nmove in particular deserved a better fate; Steve Gee centred\nto the near post, Terry Grimwade flicked it on, and there\nwas Terry Lind on to hit a stunning left foot volley which was magnificently\nturned away by the goalkeeper.\nThe last 10 minutes saw\nthe game degenerate into a series of petty incidents. Ian\nHuntingdon had a disagreement\nwith a Kings defender and\ntried ( uns ecce s s fully) to ensure\nthat he too would visit the\ndentist. This was followed\nby the Kings captain being\nsent off for questioning the\nreferee's parentage (That's a cute way of putting \" it \u2014 Ed).

As usual IC were two players short\nand since they had been told\nthat (this week) St Helier\nwould have a full team, IC were expecting a hard match.\nIn fact St Helier only had a one man advantage, but they\nhad a heavier team than the\nweek before. St Helier are\nnoted for being a' physical' team and this match was no\nexception. The IC defence\nquickly learnt the act of the\n'take out' which involves\nmaking sure that when someone\nruns into you it hurts them\nthem more than it does you. Meanwhile IC's attack were\nhaving troubles of their own, namely that St He lier had a heavy defence so IC were\ncoming from fifteen to twenty\nyards out and were easily snapped up by the goalkeeper.\nFor most of the first half\nSt Helier had the upper hand.\nIC's attack were having little\nOrienteering\nROSEN WINS THE LEAGUE\nsuccess. At half time St He lier lead 4 - 2 .\nOver the interval IC tried\nto regain some composure s At the start of the third quarter IC somehow came into the ascend jan cy. It wasn'tso much a case of scoring lots of goals, but\nmore a case of keeping\npossession and just plugging\naway at goal. The defence\nreally tightened up so that at\nthe end of the third quarter IC lead by 5\u20144,\nThe last quarter started with\nIC scoring two more goals. They then decided to employ\nthe rather dangerous policy of just keeping possession and not really going to hard\nfor goal. This resulted in a very active last ten minutes as the light faded and St Helier\nrepeatedly attempted to make\nup the three goal difference, IC managed to hold them off and\nended a very close game, the\nvictors by 7\u20148,\nTeam: Bill Jackson (Capt),\nPete Watson, Bob Strangeway,\nRob Morrisson, Richard Forster,\nTony Hallett, Tony Armstrong,\nMartin Trewhella.\nAt Camberley last Sunday,\nthe Orienteering Club took part\nin the Southern Navigators\nEvent on Barossa Common, This is an area of Army land,\ncrisscrossed by tank tracks,\nand the ha x ard s included rolls\nof barbed wire and slit trenches.\nThe event officials were\nmainly Army personnel, which meant that the event had one\nor two oddities.\nThe car park was some way\ninto the common, along a very\nbumpy track, which shook up\nthe occupants of the minibus\nslightly \u2014 perhaps Martin\nKessler thought he was driving\na land rover. On the 11 kilometre\n' A' course, the only IC runner\nwas David Rosen, who despite an Army 'funny',\ncompleted the course in70 minutes 52 sees. The 'funny'\nwas that there was an incorrect\ncontrol code \u2014 the number on the side of the marker which\ntells you that you are at the\nright control, Con seq yentl y, he\nspent a couple of minutes\nscouring the area, before\ndeciding that he had been in the right place to begin with.\nHis time was nevertheless\nfast enough to make him the\nclear winner of the South East area league for 1976, despite\nthe fact that there is one more\nleague race to go.\nThere were five IC runners\non the ' B' course for men under\n21, Andy Quick fall, the newly\nelected.

Now don't get me wrong, I 'll sniff glue with the next\ndegenerate, and there's no one I'd rather see in London today,\nthan a good punk rock band go through it spaces, but for a music paper to come out with such fallacies is just not on. Lets take a closer look at the headline 'Damned Head For\nThe Charts'. Right, the Damned, I caught their act at the Red Cow a week or so ago. It was their first London gig. The crowd who turned up came I would think, as much out of\ncuriosity as anything, also perhaps encouraged by the fab\nreview given to the group by a Sounds critic at a gig in Bedford\nthe previous week. I, as well as 95% of the audience that\nnight, will tell you boy, were they shit. The barrage of sound\nthat emin a ted from on stage was greeted not even by what one\ncould call polite applause by the attend en ce, the majority of which were all seasoned punk ster s. 'Head for the Charts'?\nClose scrutiny of the paragraph given to the band on page two\nreveals that in fact, the Damned's first single for the obscure\nStiff label has sold4,000 copies (so they say). When you consider that on average a single has to sell around 25,000\nbefore it even reaches the Top Thirty, the Sounds headline\nbecomes a bad joke. So what exactly are the Sounds editorial board up too?\nHave they all gone overboard at their newly discovered music\nform? In fact, punk-rock as it is today dates back to 66/67\npsych a delia when the punks were a backlash against the\nhippie culture; the sort of kids who'd rather give you a kick\nin the groin than a flower, #r maybe its just that this music paper has trouble filling space. Anyway, you can be the best judge by going along and\nlistening to them yourselves. Among the gig listings there are\nsprinkled a few that feature punk bands; Vibrators, Subway\nSect, Clash, Jam, Rockets anu the very wonderful Stranglers.\nThe Mike dinner on Wednesday \u2014 as Mike Slone \u2014 Murphy saw it\n\n"

This would be the first drop since\n1939, and would result in a total of 268,000 students,\n17,000 fewer than the government target.\nInformed sources at the\nuniversities, however, do not\nbelieve that such a drop is likely.

NOVEMBER5 th1976 Linstead Hail\nOnce again L instead Hall has\nhit the headlines, as it did on the\n29th January this year with the\nL instead benefaction., Topic, the\nCollege paper, is also ding its first\narticle since February on the\nextension plans.\nThere was some cause tic feedback\non my editorial a for night ago, when\nI announced that FELIX would be\ndoing a feature on the extension. However, nobody has refuted my\nsuggestion that more open College discussion is needed on the subject\nof the proposed building.\nBut, when you do start to wade\nthrough the plans for such an\nimmense project you realise perhaps\nwhy. The task is daunting in that we\nnow have three plans and an awful\nlot of controversy as to how we should\ngo about spending the benefactor's money.\nI have seen all three plans. Like the Department of Architecture and\nPlanning at Westminster City Council, I am not particularly impressed with\nthe low rise idea, on principle. In\nthis respect I like the College plans, although I may well find cause to grumble at some of the sem a tics later on. Nevertheless in a building of\nthis size on this tight a budget\n(\u00a3350,000) compromises have to be\nmade. The great thing is that College is doing what it can to get more\ndesperately needed accommodation.\nIt's a great pity that' they have been\nthwarted over planning permission\nfor the present time; let us hope they\ncan salvage something.\nSports Editing\nEditing articles is a necessary\nevil; theoretically, and ideally, I should not even need to look at the\ngrammar, spelling and punctuation of\nsubmitted articles., let alone, as in many cases rewrite them totally so they make sense to the reader and Var i typist. In reply (o my Davy' s letter (page\n10), I do not aim to limit sport to one\npage of FELIX. If good lively material\nis submitted on time then I will print\nit with few, if any, alterations.\nHowever each article has to earn its place in FELIX \u2014 hence the two\nsoccer articles printed last .week.\nNevertheless some planning is necessary, otherwise the paper would\nalways be out Tuesday. Hence I have\nto decide early in the week (after\n2pm Monday) as to what space each section is getting. If that section\noverruns its \"quota then articles get\nchopped by editing out paragraphs.\nAt least, though, I managed to preserve\nhalf of your, (Mr Davy' s) article and\"\nit did make sense. Others in other\nsections weren'tso lucky.\nRegarding the What'sOn and\nreviews sections, might I point out that FELIX has to cater for other\ntastes than yours Mr pave y. Mascots\nLet me endorse the RCS view\nthat mascot ry should not endanger\nlife and / or limb.

On top of this\nwould be seven 2-storey\nmaison et tes each containing\nrooms for nine students.\" The\narea behind the maison et tes would be used to provide three\ntennis courts, under which\nwould be a car park. On the\nnorthside of the Square there\nwould be further 2-storey\nmaison et tes above the Sports\nCentre. These would accommodate sixty students. In\nfront of these would be a conservatory.\nThe scheme from Professor\nWiggins is based on a collegiate staircase principle\nfavoured by Oxford and\nCarnbrdige colleges. The present car park and games\ncourt area would contain nine\naccommodation blocks each\nof three or four storeys. Rooms\nwould be let off the central\nstaircase at half floor\nintervals. Professor Wiggins\nand his architect, Stephen\nGardiner, believe that the\ncourtyard atmosphere created\nwill enhance social life and\nprovide more attractive\naccommodation. Each block\nhas a roof garden on top,\nwhich is sheltered from the\nnorth by mez zan ire sections. The scheme accommodates\n280 students and extra common\nrooms are envisaged. The first stage of this proposal\ninvolves the construction of\nthree blocks. So? whilst the College plans have been rejected,\nthe debate as to what is right\nand proper for the square\ngoes on. On the one. hand\nCollege, its architects, and\nthe DAP W Call support a medium to high rise develop-ment, which would not, they\nclaim, introduce a third style\nof architecture into Princes Gardens. -On the other' side\nare the Knightsbridge\nAssociation and Professor\nWiggins who seperate ly argue\nfor a low rise development\nof two to four floors, and that\na new architectural style can be introduced.\nDensity problems\nFurther argument centres\naround the number of students\nthat ought to be accommodated\nin the new buildings. College, its architects, the DAP W CC and Professor Wiggins say that a density of 200 persons\nper acre (ppa) is not in appropriate for student\naccommodation. The proposed\nL instead extension would\nbring the density up to 170\u2014\n180ppa, The Knightsbridge\nAssociation quote the GLC Development Plan recommendation of 85\u2014lOOp pa for\n'domestic accommodation'.\nTheir proposals for the\nsquare are based on a density\nof 90ppa \u201e Against this the\nDAP W CC comment that\n85\u2014lOOp pa 'is not considered\nan appropriate yardstick in\nthis case'.\nNo go to low rise\nThe DAP W CC also come\nout against a low rise development for the square in their\nreport to the Planning Committee (paragraph 16):\nWith regard to the character\nof Princes Gardens, on one\nwould doubt that the components of that character are\nstrong, whether they be the\nexisting, though much disliked,\npost war College development;\nthe listed terraces on the\nwest and north side or the\nfine, matur.e and in some\ncases 90 foot high, plane trees.\nThe central garden is also\nlarge in scale and the entire\nSquare represents a simple\nand bold. statement which\nrequires to be completed\non the east side in a way\nwhich a small scale low\nrise development would not\nresolve. It is far this reason\nthat at no. stage have the\narchitects to the college\nbeen advised to do other than\nconform to the lines of the\nSquare, in order to retain\nthe essential characteristic\nenclosure which is typical of\nthe London Squares.\nLocal residents had said\nthat the College plans were\n'hideous' and 'inappropriate\nfor the square'.\nAt present the College is waiting for the decision to\nbe officially communicated\nto them before deciding on\nfurther action.

This bunch get close, up in both US and our\nvery own singles scenarios with the\nopener 'Play that Funky music'. Slightly\nsub-commodores standard but still mighty\nfine.\nSome good bands have emerged from\nthe bad-ass fon k field, notably Brass\nConstruction, the aforementioned Motown\n-maestros, and war. From this album it\nsounds like Wild Cherry, even though\njust a bunch' a honk ies, could be\njoining the higher echelons pretty soon\nif they maintain their essence and energy\nfor longer than a couple of sides-worth.\nThe group are made up of Robert\nParis si, twin lead quit ars with Bryan\nBassett; Allen Wentz on bass, and the\nskin flicking of Ronald Be if le. Although\na quartet, the action is strictly Paris si controlled, producing the proceedings\nand penning six of the nine available\nsnippets. The other three are by such\nsoul luminaries as Wilson Pickett, Steve\nCropper, and the formidable Holland Dozier-Holland midfield trio.\nWild Cherry and their vibes aim at the\nmore immediately mobile parts of the\nanatomy \u2014 feet, arms, hips \u2014 with a tailor-made beat for those who appreciate\na good sweat on the floor. It's get-up-and-shake-the-funky-cobwebs dancing\nmusic and just the sort of thing to\ndyno-rod the circulation when you've\nhad a couple.\nMind you, the stuffing starts to get\na bit thin by the middle of the B side, with a shallow do oh dah called 'Hold on'\nand the sensitively-titled 'Get it up'\nwhich in the end turns out to be a rather\nlimp 'organ'-based instrumental with a certain lack Of thrust about it. Obvious\nBlakoe malfunction. No matter \u2014 the\nband boogies on out at full pelt on the\nclosing track 'What in the funk do you\nIt's not a great musical achievement;\nit wasn't intended to be, but as far as vitality goes it beats the eyeballs out of\nboring, overpaid, old farts (Robin Trower\nto name but a half) currently following\nthe same well-trodden, well-heeled,\npaths on their supposedly ' new' releases. Fonk field re vitali sed \u2022 jR A HAM CENTRAL The thing with disco-funk bands is\nthat really they are a live como di ty. Put them in the sterile surrounds of a recording studio, and no matter how hard\nthey try, no way are they going to get\nanywhere near the feel of their stage\nact. Graham Central Station are no\ndifferent. I'd probably dig their show\nanytime, but play them on an old tin box\nin a Maida Vale squat on a cold October\nnight?. No, the only way a band like\nthis can do justice to themselves is on\na live stage, where thankfully presence\nand atmosphere count as much \u2014 sometimes more \u2014 than the songs being laid\ndown.\nTry as they do, the Station just can't bring the vinyl alive even though they\nstart with the intro to their act - the semi\ninstrumental 'Entraw', where they invite\nthe listener to ' a party'. At first they\nappear to have everything. Slick professionalism? You bet. Tight\nmusicianship? Sure as hell. Harmonies?\nSTATION 'MIRROR'\nfaultless, but atmosphere? None.\nThe songs aren'tall that memorable\n(again, not always the most important\nthing in a live context), ranging from the\nstandard funk of 'Do Yah' (no relation\nto the Move claim), the present single\n'/ got a reason', with its deft reggae\nslanting, sung in a' soul y falsetto'. On\nthe other hand you can forget the psu edo gospel lyricism of 'Forever'; the song has\na nice melodic synthesizer passage\nrunning through it.\nThe best track is probably 'Save Me',\nwhich opens up side Two, and has a particularly catchy chorus line. Although\nstrings and horns are used throughout,\nthey are always held back to allow the\nrhythm section and vocal lines to be\nwell to the fore.\nAlthough a big act in the States,\nwhere their last album went Gold, in this\ncountry they are destined one feels only\nto be adored in the land of the disco.
