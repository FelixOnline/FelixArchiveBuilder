It was the first competition\nthat the Club has entered, and we\ndid correspondingly badly. We lost\nthe first game against Clapham A:70. We decided to bring on our\nCity-Boy substitute Tim, and only\nlost the next game against Marlett\nB40. Our luck changed as we\nwent into the next game with some\nidea of tactics, and used ShockBlond Sam, and \"Solid Grade V\" Adam in defence, with Old-Hat\nColin in Goal. Success! we beat\nClapham B20. ULU A played ad is a pointing game against us (From\ntheir point of view) only beating us\n2-0. ULU B( AKA The women's team) tried very hard to beat us,\nand very nearly did, our Tall-Bloke\nJorg was very frustrated by them,\nbut the score: 1-1. After that the\nbest team of the day creamed us,\nand not even our secret weapon\nULU-Traitor Daniel could do anything about it: 8-0. Over all we\ncame 5th out of 7, and have been\ninvited back to play in the summer.\nThe only National public Snowboarding exhibition, Board - X, is\nnearly upon us.

Aside from a miserable first 15 minutes when we\nconceded an unlucky try and drop-goal we put Bart's under constant\npressure. It wasn't helped by the\nref having a whistle phobia.\nOnce the team got their arse s in gear we put them under permanent pressure and were unlucky\nnot to score. With backs and forwards crashing to within millimetres of the line by mistake would\nsee us being driven back down the\npitch.

    "content": "NEWS FEATURE 24th October 1997\nMerger Splurger\nA guide to the new IC School of Medicine\nThe last piece of the jigsaw was\nfinally in place with the merger of\nCharing Cross and Westminster\nMedical School (CXWMS) and the\nRoyal Postgraduate Medical School\n(RPMS) with Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine (ICSM) on the\nIst August this year. An annual\nintake of 300 makes it not only the\nlargest medical school in this co un try, but also in Europe.\nICSM is mainly based over five\ndifferent sites. The Sir Alexander\nFleming Building in South\nKensington, hitherto known as the\nBiomedical Science Building (BMS),\nwould be home to the medical students before they start their clinical\ntraining. Current students at\nCharing Cross and St Mary's will\nalso receive their lectures there\nonce a week.\nSituated across Hyde Parknext to the historic Paddington\nRailway Station - is St Mary's Hospital, which has developed a strong link with the College following the merger of its medical school\nwith IC nine years ago.\nThe National Lung and Heart\nInstitute is now a division on its\nown right in the structure of the\nschool. It boasts such distinguished\nclinicians as Professor Sir Magdi\nYacoub, a world famous heart\ntransplant surgeon who is based at\nthe Royal Brompton Hospital.\nConfusions sometimes arise\nwith the locations of the remaining\ntwo teaching hospitals. Charing\nCross Hospital is not at Charing\nCross; instead it is in\nHammersmith, with the nearest\ntube station being Baron's Court.\nOn the other hand, Hammersmith\nHospital, the site of the former\nRPMS, is actually just north of East\nActon.\nA new medical course will be\nintroduced with the intakes of\n] 998. The incorporation of a compulsory BSc year means it will be\none year longer than the current\none. However, it is expected that\nthose who have already got a degree before their entry will be\nexempted from the BSc year. There\nare also plans to follow the example of other medical schools,\nnotably UCL, and allow those who\nare graduates in a medically related\nsubject, such as physiology,\nanatomy and pharmacology, to\nundertake a \"fast track\" course,\nwhich will last for four years. In\ncontrast to the old course - which\nis clearly divided into a pre-clinical\nand clinical component - the new\ncurriculum, written with a substantial amount of student input, features clinical contacts for students\nright from day one.\nThe 1998 intakes will be\nhoused with students from other\ndisciplines together in South\nKensington. Wilson House,\nPembridge Gardens, and Brabazon\nHouse will be used to ac com mo unlike the other CCUs, the president and vice-president of\n1CS MSU, Katie Armstrong and Nick\nCarter, are both sabbatical officers.\nThe sabbatical position for the\npresident is hoped to continue for\nthe next three years, as many problems still need ironing out whilst\nthe transition is still in progress.\nThe likelihood of the post being\nconverted into a sabbatical position\nfor a welfare officer (as is currently\nspeculated) is small because most\nSt. Mary's Charing\ndate clinical medics and overseas\npostgraduates.\nThe merger of the two undergraduate medical schools has led\nto the formation of a new student\nunion - ICSM Student Union, which\nhas an equivalent status to the\nunions of other constituent colleges (the CCUs). Despite this the\nmedical union receives a much\ngreater slice of the sub vent ion money given by the college to the\nunions. Whilst the sub vent ion for\nthe other CCUs is around \u00a313,000\na year, that of ICSM currently\nstands at roughly \u00a3100,000 (this\nfigure is calculated by adding the\nsums previously given to Charing\nCross and Mary's). Moreover,\nof the funding for the post is\nrumoured to have come from the\nalumni associations of the medical\nschools rather than from Imperial\nCollege Union.\nSome of the clubs from Charing\nCross and Mary's have already\nmerged, the most notable one\nbeing the rugby clubs. The two have\nfor a long time been regarded as\nthe best teams in London. They\nhave played against each other in\nevery United Hospital Cup Final for\nthe last four years, with Charing\nCross claiming three victories. Last\nyear was the exception, when\nMary's found themselves having to\nplay (and subsequently beaten by)\nGuy's in the final, as their traditional rival failed to get through the\nfirst round.\nThe fierce sense of sibling\nrivalry of the past has now been\nreplaced by one of unity. Not only\nare they determined to recapture\nthe United Hospital Cup, but also\nto prove themselves on the\nnational scene (and hopefully end\nCardiff Medical School's winning\nstreak). The choirs and orchestras\nhave also joined together to form\nthe new ICSM Music Society, and\nLinks (St John Ambulance) from the\ntwo medical schools are now part\nof the Imperial College branch.\nThe advantages - besides having an invincible rugby team - are\nobvious. For clinical students, the\nnet of teaching hospitals has\nwidened by combining the teaching\nhospitals of St Mary's and Charing\nCross. Unlike their predecessors\nisolated in a medics-only en v iron ment, the new pre clinical s will have\nthe chance to mix in with a much\ngreater range of students.\nHowever, the physical separation of sites at the moment still\npresents a barrier to integration\nbetween students from Imperial\nand the medics on different sites.\nThere are also the logistic problems\nin managing services such as student bars at so many different\nsites. The vice-president for external affairs of CXWMSSU, commented that the merger was a good idea but more communication and discussion would be\nneeded with IC to ensure a smooth\ntransfer of services.\nThe merger might have officially\ntaken place on 1st August, but it\nwas the full-scale bar invasion of\n1CU by students from Charing Cross\nand Mary's that truly marked the\nmoment. The last piece of the jigsaw may be in place, but only time\ncould tell if it will fit in smoothly\nwith the rest of the puzzle.\nClare Ashwin and Kent Yip\n\n"

    "content": "m2 NEWS 24 October 1997\nThat Thing RAG Do New Evacuation For\nThis year's RAG (Raising And\nGiving) collections have got off to\na good start with the first two\nmaking over \u00a31600.\nThe first took place on the first\nSaturday of term, and was part of\nthe annual MENCAP mega raid, in\nwhich students from universities all\nover the country take part to raise\nmoney for the mentally handicapped children and adults. This\nyear the mega raid also had a Rocky\nHorror Show theme, so many of\nthose taking part donned suspender belts and bras in an effort\nto emulate the gender-bending\ncharacters in the cult musical.\nImperial supplied around thirty\ncollectors, many of whom were in\ndrag, but also included the constituent college motor clubs, who\nturned up to shake tins and to ferry\nthe wet transvestites around town.\nTraditionally, IC students play\ntiddlywinks along Oxford Street as\npart of the event, but the weather\nprevented this from happening, as\nany fiddles (or winks) would simply\nhave stuck to the ground. Ignoring\nthe fact that the tissue paper\nstuffed down a lot of the collectors\nchests would have fallen out while\nIt is the last chance for you to\nrepresent your fellow students as\ntheir Union President or Deputy\nPresident.\nCandidates who want to stand for\nelection may only do so before\n5.00pm today by signing up on the\nnotice board opposite the Union\nOffice. Those standing must have\none proposer and twenty second ers backing them with their signatures also on the board.\nThe current situation has three\npeople - Mark Baker (who is fully\nseconded), Paula Luesling and\nAndrew Heeps (who aren't fully\nseconded) - standing for President\nand only one, Charlie Joynt, standing for Deputy President. Their\ncampaign machines will soon be\noff and running so if you feel you\ncan take the heat and beat them,\nsign up now. If you would like to\nbending over to play. The cold and\nrain also put pay to plans to throw\nthe RAG chairwoman, Louise Choo\ninto the fountain on Piccadilly c ir cus. This did not stop the very cold\ntr annie s from collecting over\n\u00a31100 during the day, though.\nLast Saturday also saw a collection around London, this time with\nno running mascara or laddered\ntights, for UNICEF and UNA. This\ncollection attracted a slightly\nsmaller following, but still managed\nto raise about \u00a3500 for the chari-ties.\nForthcoming events include a collection for John Grooms around\nLondon and the Sponsored Nude\nKamikaze Parachute Jump - in\nwhich students run in the nude\nfrom Harrods to Beit Quad (15th of November), a collection at the\nWimbledon vs Manchester United\nmatch (22nd of November), sponsored fire walking on Queens lawn\n(19th of November). To get\ninvolved, turn up at the RAG meetings in dBs on Thursday lunchtimes\nat 1.10pm. Matthew Bennett\nknow what these candidates will\ndo to our Union and ask them\nsome difficult questions, turn up to\nthe hustings where an outline of\neach candidates' plans for the\nUnion will be given. If you don't like\nany candidates, New Election is\nalso standing.\nDates for Hustings are Monday\n3rd of November at IC Union and\nThursday 6th of November at\nCharing Cross. There is another\nhustings planned at St. Mary's in\nPaddington but no date has been\nset yet. Felix will keep you up to\ndate with the latest election news\nas it comes in.\nThe voting date is the 10th and\n11th of November in all main\ndepartments and campuses.\nPhyz\nStaff?\ncontinued from front page\nIronically, the cylinders, which\nwere part of some redundant laser\napparatus, were due for removal\nthis week, and waste-disposal\ncompany was already on site to\ngive a estimate of the disposal\ncosts. The apparatus had been left\nin the laboratory for a long period\nmainly due to reluctance of staff to\nget rid of it. \"The longer equipment\nis left\", said lan Gillett, \"the higher\nthe risk of problems\". Meanwhile,\nthe cylinders are still lying behind a cordon on the Physics lawn. The\nmethod of their disposal has still\nnot been decided- one possibility is\nthat they may be packed in sand\ninside a drum and taken away to a landfill site.\nWhilst generally satisfied with\nthe response from students and\nSouthside Bar was the site of an\nattack by the captain of the IC\nrugby team on one of his club\nmembers.\nThe incident occurred on the\nWednesday of Freshers' Week following some rugby matches by the\nteams. Every week after a game,\nthe rugby and football teams congregate in Southside Bar to enjoy a drink or two amongst friends and\nthey usually end up becoming very\nintoxicated. The first Wednesday\nof the new term was no different.\nAfter a few pints, the traditional 'boat race' was held between the\ntwo sports teams. For those not\nacquainted with this competition,\nit involves equal sets of people\neach trying to drink a pint as fast as\npossible but they can only drink\ntheirs after the person in front of\nthem has finished.\nTo the disappointment of the\nrugby boys, the football team won.\nSongs of ridicule passed between\nthe two respective teams as alcohol fueled emotions. One of tables\nin the bar was damaged by a football member who scratched the\nwords \"FOOTBALL ONLY' on the\ntable that the football team was sitting at. An employee from\nstaff, Mr. Gillett expressed concern that some members of staff\nfailed to evacuate from the build-ing. Staff had been seen watching\nfrom upstairs windows when the\nalarm was ringing, whilst others\ndecided to walk through the\nBlackett Laboratory from the adjacent Huxley Building, where the\nalarm was not ringing. This was\ndescribed by Mr. Gillett as \"highly\nirresponsible behaviour\".\nIt is the first time in ten years\nthat such an incident has arisen at\nIC. Mr. Gillett said that, although\npotentially dangerous, it was handled in the best possible way.\nEd Pavelin\nSouthside, noticed that the atmosphere that Wednesday night was\ndifferent saying that \"things were\nworse than usual\".\nTowards the end of the night\nwhile the rugby team drank to get h er, the Firsts team captain, Oliver\nLyttleton, accidentally knocked\nover his own drink. The team have\na tradition that they brought back\nfrom Australia after their summer\ntour called 'shooting the boot'.\nThis is a penalty where anyone\ncaught spilling an alcoholic beverage has to drink beer from their\nown boot. After extensive coaxing\nOliver still refused to pay the\npenalty as his shoes were ex pen sive, so one of the rugby players,\nTom Hovard, attempted to\nremove it. In retaliation, the captain punched Mr Hovard leaving\nhim with a bad facial wound.\nThe Women's minibus driver,\nAnne Ovens, drove Mr Hovard to\nhospital where he received five\nstitches.\nMr Lyttleton's attack had come\nafter a stressful period of captaincy\nand following the incident, he\nresigned his captaincy.\nTony Ofori\nRugby Bash-Up In\nSouthside Bar\nLast Chance For\nStudents To Stand\n\n"

If ordered to\ndo something you know is\nwrong, such as execute\nsomeone, would you go\nthrough with it? It's an order,\nafter all, and the man giving\nthe orders must know far\nbetter than you, mustn't he?\nFaith puts us in the midst\nof a battle. Four members of\na British army platoon are\nrelaxing in a local house a short distance from the front\nline. The strains of war are\ntaking their toll on the soldiers and just when it\nappears that life really can't get any worse, they take a captive who turns out to be\nan American mercenary. Not\nwishing to strain diplomatic\nrelationships with the US, the\nsergeant's superiors order\nthe mercenary's immediate\nexecution. The squad is left\nin a moral vacuum. Should\nthey choose to disobey orders or to\ngo ahead with the execution and\nsomehow come to terms with their\nown conscience?\nFor me, the best thing by far\nabout this play is the degree to\nwhich the characters develop. The\nsergeant, for example, has obviously been driven over the edge by\nthe pressure placed upon him. His\nfeet have been badly injured and\nalthough he would normally be glad\nfor any excuse to escape, even\nbriefly, from the horrors of the front\nline, he is eager to return to\nthe fray in order to prove\nhis courage to his disillusioned troops and to him-self. He is almost constantly arguing with one of his\ncorporals, and an intriguing\nparadox is formed. At one\npoint he insists that the corporal follow his orders,\nbecause he has worked and\ntrained his way to the higher rank and so is better\nequipped to make decisions. But, of course, once\nthe execution order has\nbeen given, the sergeant\nquestions not only the\norder itself, but his super i ors' right to take such decisions for him.\nOverall, a highly entertaining play.

It was immediately\nsuccesful and received mor e performances than any other Haydn\nopera except Armida. Strangely\nthough, it was not performed in\nthis country until the Camden\nFestival of 1971 and has since only\nbeen staged twice, at\nGlyndebourne and Garsington\nFestivals.\nThe libretto by Giambattista\nLorenzi mixes scenes of high comedy with many moments of deep\nand serious emotion which drew\nfrom Haydn some of his finest\nmusic. The cat 1 finale is the\nlongest concerted number which\nHaydn ever wrote, extending to\nabout eighteen minutes and involving seven characters in a sophisticated music o dramatic structure\nYour chance to see\nopera at a student-friendly price\nwhile the overture was later to\nreappear as Haydn's73 rd Symphony, La Chasse.

That's why these\ngames always always are a bit special, and the season's first\nencounter between the two arch-rivals had it all: a hat-trick from\nJamie Foulstone, a broken leg and\na goal from captain Psycho.\nWith Jamie back in the side\nImperial were in control from the\nstart. Alex Marcos gave IC the lead\nwith his first of the season, and\neven though Royal Holloway\nequalise d after poor goal keeping by Donal Keane, 4 further goals\nfrom Jamie (2), Alex (again) and\nNorwegian sensation Germund\nKnutsen meant that the hosts were\n5-1 down at half-time. To make\nmatters worse they were actually a player down as well as one of their\nmidfielders were carried off with a broken leg after one of Psycho's customary challenges.\nIn the 2nd half Foulstone completed his hat-trick while new boy\nMikael Askerdal scored with a fine\nheader. Holloway pulled one back\nform the penalty spot before Psycho\ngot Imperial's8 th goal with a superb\nfree-kick from 30 yards. Undoubtedly\nthe worst free kick ever.\nThe pride of Imperial has been\nrestored. The beer can once again\nflow freely down the Bar. In the\nwords of former Club Vice-Captain\nPhillip Siverns: \"The Duke of\nPrague has been awakened\".\nHolloway 1 2 - 8 ICFC I The famous Imperial Fourths\nsecured their first point of the season on Saturday with a hard fought\ndraw against the team f tom Canterbury, Wye.\nThe game itself produced a battling performance from 1C, so\ntypical of the Fourth's style of play,\nand to be truthful is where our\nstrength lies. It was goal-less at\nhalf-time with only a couple of\nchances for either team, but almost\nfrom the restart a through-ball cut\nIC's defence and the Wye striker\nrounded the IC 'keeper. Thankfully\nwe didn't lie down and capitulate\nbut rolled our sleeves even further\nup our arms and managed to dominate the majority of the rest of the\ngame. The deserved equalise r came from a well-worked move:\nbirthday-boy Paul found Ryan on\nthe right who swept in a low cross\nand Richard, beating the defender\nto the ball, volleyed into the bottom corner from twelve yards. We\nhad a couple of chances to win the\ngame but unfortunately none were\ntaken. Credit must be given to the\nIC 'keeper who crucially saved a one-on-one in the second-half\nMan of the match must have\nbeen David Wishart who dominated the midfield. Captain Swift and\nPaul also played very well both distributing the ball from the back\nwith the utmost composure .\nWithout doubt we will do well\nboth in BUSA and the league.\nKing's IV 2 - 2 ICFC IV\nRun D 'eM iC\nThere was bright sunshine and\ncrisp autumn air for this year's first\nrunning me eet. Unfortunately the\ncourse was not as pleasant, as a large Imperial contingent travelled\nto the severely testing hills of\nHampstead Heath.\nAfter finishing runners up to\nBrunei in the London colleges\nleague, IC men were hoping to\nwrestle the title off them this time\naround. But they finished second\nbest again. A great deal of potential\nwas shown, though, and with five\ntop-ten finishes there is real\nstrength in depth.\nBen and Captain Chris Fishlock\nwere as depend abv le as ever, finishing sixth and ninth respectively.\nDemetrius, captain of ULU, came a respectable nineteenth. Arguably\nthe biggest bonus of the day was\nthe discover ey of two possible athletics stars in PGs Gary Mcghee\nand Neil Mclntyre, who were both\nplaced in the mid-teens.\nThe women's team continue to\ndominate with a comfortable win.\nThere was no surprise to see jenny\nCox record yet another majestic\nvictory, to go with two other top-ten finishes from the girls. Captain\nBethan Hopewell is set to return\nfrom injury at the next race, so they\nca only get stronger.\nAnyone is welcome to attend\nraces or train on a Wednesday\nafternoon. So keep watching the\nnoticeboard.\nMJ Ward\nOur first match of the season was\nagainst King's scrubbers. Not only\nwere we insulted by having to play\nin a field but we also had to change\nin a porta-cabin.\nWe started the match very\nwell, completely outplaying Kings.\nWe had two shots cleared off the\nline and then tragedy struck with\nconfusion at the back and Kings\nbeat our keeper Jimmy.\nThe second half began much\nbetter with an early goal - Ole\ncrossed the ball in from the right\nand Villeneuve put the ball in the\nnet. We kept showing the more\nfluid play but somehow Kings broke\nthrough. Mark put in a firm tackle\non their defender who kicked blatantly and BO, our substitute who\nwas reffing, awarded the opposition a penalty. Kings scored and\nwent on to win the match. BO,\nneedless to say, is dropped.\nICFC VI -2 King'sV ICFC II v KING'S II\nA brilliant first half, a crap second. The\nopening goal was a50 yard s creamer from Si, Warren ate Dorothy (he's got\nred boots, think about it kids) scored a carbon - copy of Saturday's gorgeous-ness and then bagged a second. From\noutside the box Hajo \"Double\" Dekker\nplaced it in the top comer to finish them\noff. Good performances from Dan,\nMartin, Loz, Steve, Jessie, Patrik, Felix,\nAndy and Chris in goal.

    "content": "24 October 1997 COLUMNS\nTimes have been tough for Robin\nCook recently. Our Foreign\nSecretary has been embroiled in a series of disputes on nearly all\ncontinents so far, and it looks like\nthere's no stopping him.\nHis first foray into international\nconfrontations came with his criticism of South-East Asian countries\non their human rights record.\nAlthough commendable, the bluntness in which it was said - the\nwording of the statements he was\nmaking sounded more like a bol-locking and less like a Foreign\nSecretary's diplomatic speech. Add\nto this his relative youth and complete inexperience in the post and\nyou have the recipe for a serious\ninternational spat, with the United\nKingdom being compared to the\nUnited States in its ability to tell\nother countries what to do.\nTalking of our former colonial\nfriends, Mr Cook has earned the\nlasting hatred of one extremely\npowerful bigot in the US Congress,\none Senator Jesse Helms. Senator\nHelms, a right-wing southerner, has\nearned his place a Chairman of the\npowerful State Foreign Relations\nCommittee as the longest serving\nRepublican member, rather than\nthrough any genuine democratic\nprocess. Helms may be a bigot, but\nhe is a very clever and able one,\nand there are many cautionary tales\nassociated with crossing him. He\nmanaged to singe-handedly 'veto'\nthe selection of a prospective U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, against the\nwishes of the President, Congress\nand the media. Mr Cook had a scheduled a half-hour meeting with\nthe Mr Helms. It was cut short after\n20 minutes. Mr Helms had not\nreacted kindly to Cook's typically\nblunt words, this time concerning\nthe U.N. which is owed a ten-figure\nsum by the U.S., who are refusing\nto pay until it reforms itself in a best, (they have just charged an\neight-year old girl with an offence\nthat carries an automatic death\npenalty, and had recently executed\na fifteen year old boy for renouncing his Muslim faith). They also\nhave contracts with us for billions\nof pounds per year. So when the\ntwo the plight of the two British\nnurses came into the media spotlight again with the announcement\nof the guilty verdict and sentencing,\nHamish Common\nWestminster\nEye\nmanner which the Americans would\nlike. Mr Helms had said \"we saved\nyour ass twice this century, and you\ncome and criticise us?\" Mr Cook\nhad apparently not taken his\ndepartment's advice on how to\ntreat him, deciding that confrontation would be the best option. It\ntook all of Blair's rapport with\nClinton to mend what could have\nbeen a damaging and needless rift.\nBut more was to come. After\ninsulting the United States, Mr\nCook quickly moved on to Saudi\nArabia, another country whose\nhuman rights record is sketchy at\nCook responded by calling the\nSaudi nation 'barbaric', which may\nbe true, but did much to an tag on is e them in this very sensitive time. It\ntook much backtracking and eating\nof humble pie to smooth the ruffled\nfeathers. The blood money payment to the victim's sister was\nactually paid by the arms companies, worried about the loss of contracts were the diplomatic row to\ngrow more serious.\nFinally the latest and saddest of\nMr Cook's blunders was his comments in Pakistan and India, during\nthe Queen's State visit. These\nevents are by general pro-to col, not to be politic is ed, but Cook waded in with\ncomments that he could\nmediate over Kashmir,\ntaken by the Indians in the same\nlight as if the Indian Prime Minister\noffered to mediate over Northern\nIreland. This political comment of\nCook's was directed more Britain's own Pakistani community, which\nfurther enraged the Indians, culminating with their Prime Minister\ncalling Britain a \"third-rate power\",\na phrase which Raj aficionados may\nremember as the early twentieth\ncentury warning of what Britain\ncould become if we lost the colony.\nThe visit to India became marred in\nmany other ways stemming from\nthis, and has done damage in our\nrelations to a potential superpower\nin the years to come.\nSo what are we to make of\nCook? He was one of the leading\nlights in the Shadow Cabinet, an\nintelligent left-winger, who converted to Blairism with a zeal\nunmatched by many, but down\nbelow is unchanged. His personal\nrelations with Helms suffer from\nthe contrast between left-wing libertarian and right-wing bigot, and\nwe could kindly attribute his\nnumerous gaffes to inexperience,\nand a mouth which must be tamed\nin his new and influential position.\nOtherwise he could shoot the\nwhole of Britain in the foot.\nUndergraduate\nResearch\nOpportunities\nProgramme\n\u2022 Undergraduates: assist academic staff\nwith their researches\n\u2022 Directory of 1997 - 98 opportunities available (free)\nfrom Room 313C Mechanical Engineering\n\u2022 Information meeting: Wednesday, 29 October\n13.15 - 14.00 Room 342 Mechanical Engineering on\nUROP in general + the Delaware (USA) exchange\nscheme in particular\n\u2022 Closing date for Delaware exchange applications:\nFriday, 7 November 16.00 hours.\n\u2022 Find out more on http://www.hu.ic.ac.uk/uro p/ Help academic staff and help your career:\nJoin UROP now\nu GENERAL MEETING AND\nELECTIONS\nFEU FOOD It!\n2 5 0 tl x October12.30 to13.303 lg in room\nIP1 the Bm mmer BwW\"'\nMech.

    "content": "LETTERS 24 October 1997\nLetters to Felix...\nMONTPELIER NOT\nSO BAD\nDear Felix,\nWe feel that your recent comments regarding Montpelier Hall\nare unfounded, and stirred up a lot\nof ill feeling among the residents.\nAs a building, Montpelier Hall\nhas a lot to offer, with a large common room and single bedrooms\nleading to a more communal\natmosphere. The facilities are\nexcellent with more washing\nmachines and f lid ges per head than\nEvelyn Gardens. We also have irons\nand washing baskets provided\nunlike some other halls.\nThe hall boasts good entertainment facilities such as a dart board,\ntable tennis table, grand piano and\nsatellite television.\nThe building has character,\nreflected in the fact that the foyer\nand staircase are listed . It's situation has to be the best of all\nImperial College halls, being nearer\nto the college than Evelyn Gardens,\nand within close proximity to the\nbest known shops in London.\nOn reflection, the attitude of\nthe residents is mirrored in the fact\nthat many (over 50%) would prefer\nto stay here than to move into new\nSouthwell, and it is just another\nshow of Imperial College'sine pti tude, that they have decided to sell\nthe building..\nYours Faithfully,\nThe residents of Montpelier.\n(signed petition enclosed)\nDEARING REPORT\nIGNORED\nDear Felix,\nThanks for the article on the\nNUS campaign (NUS vs Dearing,\nFelix 1094). 1 would like to make\none point clear, however. The article claims that 'the proposals [of\nthe government] were recommended by the Dearing report'.\nThis is not strictly true, the govern-ment's proposals do not follow\nthose of Dearing. For example, the\nDearing report recommended continuing some form of maintenance\ngrant while the government proposes to scrap all grants.\nYours faithfully\nGeorge Constantinides\nIT'S THAT OLD\nSMOKING IN THE\nJCR CHESTNUT\nAGAIN\nDear Felix,\nI have lunch in j CR on a regular\nbasis, and it amazes me how many\npeople are smoking In there. Given\na type a typical lunchtime, there\nare about 20 people smoking.\nThere are at least 30 signs up in\nthere about not smoking (even with\nan easy to understand diagram, if\nyou can't read), yet these people\ncontinue to do it. It's not quite as\nsimple as just asking people to\nstop, since the usual response\ngoes along the lines of \"get stuffed\nyou twa t\".I find it completely dis-gusting, especially when eating.\nI'm sure there are other people\nwith similar views.\nYours,\nRichard Hopkins, Elec Eng\nRANT AT RANDOM\nDear Felix,\nI was in the Resource centre\nthe other day, and a little incident\nhappened (as always in this\nCollege), nothing big, just a certain\nsociety getting bullock ed by one of\nthe members of ICU staff because\ntheir posters \"didn't conform to\nUnion guidelines\". The first thing\nthat popped into my head was that\nthe Union was just giving this society (no name) a hard time as usual\n(at FF it had been a similar story).\nAnd then 1 just imagined the walkway full of posters, and tried to\nimagine how many of those do\nconform to Union regulations... (a grand total of about 3, all from the\nass-kissing society). Then I tried to\nimagine a walkway full of posters\nwhich did live up to the expectations of the Union... how fucking\nboring. But then 1 thought: When\ndid the students decide the STUDENTS' Union guidelines? As a matter of fact, when did the students decide anything concerning\nthe Union? The students elect a president and several other representatives, but that is the extent of\nour power in College.

    "content": "12 FEATURE 24 October 1997 FEATURE 13\nAt the height of his career, Howard Marks was smuggling consignments of drugs of up to thirty tons from Pakistan and Thailand to the\nUnited States and Canada making him the biggest drug smuggler in\nthe world. He had forty-three aliases, eighty-nine phone lines and\nowned twenty-five companies trading throughout the world for the\nsole purpose of money-laundering for dope dealing. An ex-MI6 agent,\nMarks also had contact with the CIA, the IRA and the Mafia who all\nwanted his talent.\nHe began dealing small amounts of hashish while doing a postgraduate philosophy of science course at Balliol College, Oxford, moving on\nto larger quantities soon after. Touring rock bands were used to move\ndrugs, stashed in their equipment, into Europe and America.\nAfter a worldwide operation by the Drug Enforcement Agency, Marks\nwas busted and sentenced to twenty-five years in Terre Haute\nPenitentiary. He served only seven years and was released in April\n1995. In another of our continuing series of inc read ib leb lags, we\nsecured a face-to-face interview with the man himself...\nSimon Wistow: Of all the places you went to, which was your favourite?\nHoward Marks: Favourite place in the world?\nWistow: Yeah.\nMarks: Uh. . Taiwan, I think, favourite country.\nWistow: Any particular reason or just...\nMarks: Yeah, because at the time 1 went there it was, you know, probably the most alien culture I'd encountered for some time and it was the\nreligion again... Taoisni, stuff like that... plus it was quite extraordinary\nyou know with the kind of manufacturing and industry... it was just so different... Wistow: Bit of a culture shock?\nMarks: Yeah, I kind of thrived on the... I think, the greater the culture\nshock, the more I liked it was basically it. That was the way I seemed to\nlike it...\nWHICH WAS THE NICEST ORGANISATION YOU CAME IN CONTACT WITH?\n\"THE MAFIA. THEY'RE LIKE ONE BIG\nHAPPY FAMILY...\"\nWistow: Not many places like South Glamorgan.\nMarks: No, but I got used to that. I had to leave it when I was about\nnineteen so...\nWistow: Urn... next question., urn.. Out of the different organisations you\nworked for, which was your favourite and why?\nMarks: Well, I didn't work for any...\nWistow: Out of the ones you had contact with...\nMarks: Which was my favourite and why? what out of the smugglers, you\nmean?\nWistow: MI6, CIA, which ones you came into contact with, which one\nwas the most fl in? Marks: Probably the Mafia, I think, or those ones, the smaller organisations.. urn., .the Brotherhood of Eternal Love were friendlier than the\nMafia but not what I would call 'fl in' Wistow: But the Mafia is a nice family business though.\nMarks: Yeah. They're ok,\nWistow: How would you say your education at Oxford prepared you for\na career in drug smuggling?\nMarks: Ah, I suppose providing an en thus iam for experiencing more culture shock.\nWistow: Good set of contacts?\nMarks: Yes, it was sort of a confidence thing, 1 think. Making good con-versa tion, Wistow: Which college did you go to?\nMarks: Balliol.\nHoward Marks:\nA Nice Man Indeed\nWistow: Which is your favourite Spice Girl?\nMarks: 1 don't know her name but the one with her hair in bunches?\nWistow: Baby Spice?\nMarks:That's the one. 1 don't know any of their names.\nWistow: Would you say your career with smuggling was a fair representation of novel business? Would you be able to give tips to young business people?\nMarks: It was very different from any legal business because the demand\nwas so high.You didn't have to have an business or entrepreneurial skills,\nit was just a lot of people wanting a lot of drugs and looking for a way to\nget it. It wasn'ta business that needed any Richard Branson type talent\nor anything. It would never succeed as a legitimate business.\nWistow: When did you discover you had a talent for journalism? I 've read\nthe first chapter of your book and it's very good and your articles in\nLoaded.\nMarks: I did a lot of writing in prison, I did a lot of teaching of English\nGrammar. The reason I wrote a lot was because it was the only means\nof communication I had.\nWistow: You taught yourself Law in prison, didn't you? Did that help?\nMarks: Yeah, I studied Prison Law and I'd already done a postgraduate\ncourse in Philosophy of Science so I guess it was a combination of those\nthings but I never realised I had any journalistic talent until I started writing the column for Loaded.\nWistow: You did Maths, Physics and Chemistry at A level, didn't you?\nDid that help you at all?\nMarks: No. You see, when I did four A levels I hadn't actually taken any\ndrugs - I was a late-starter. 1 mean, not many people where I lived had.\nThe closest thing was alcohol, urn, so 1 wasn't hip enough to take adv an Fuck me, skin up: Photo by Ivan\nt age of that - I just did them to pass exams because that's the way, I thought, to go. And I found those subjects easier to get good grades in\nthan any others.\nWistow: Would you say you had a more scientific mind?\nMarks: Not really. I have no interest in it at all, I just found them easier.\nI mean, I 've got a degree in Nuclear Physics and I can't even fix my car,\nyou know. 1 had no interest in it at all but I happened to be able to pass\nexams in them.\nWistow: How many cases that you took on as a lawyer did you win in\nprison?\nMarks: 1 took on about twenty cases but I won probably about., ten per-cent.\nWistow: Do you think they were more difficult to win given the nature of\nyour crimes?\nMarks: You see, generally, lawyers on the street don't get involved in\nprison law because a) it's boring, b) and the money is hard to find once\nyou're in prison so some lawyers don't get paid when they take on a case. So there's not a lot of interest in post-conviction law. But the Sixth\nAmendment says Law can be taught in prison and everyone in prison\nlooks to try and get some post-conviction amendment. Everyone tries,\nit's crazy.\nWistow: How many different prison systems have you been involved in?\nMarks: England, Holland, Spain and America.\nWistow: Which was the nicest?\nMarks: Spain, primarily because they allow conjugal visits. Plus they're\nnot too worried about what comes into the prison, only what goes out.\nAmerica can vary - they can be quite nice, like a holiday camp, or they\ncan be the worst prisons in the world.\nWistow: How did you get into contact with MI6?\nMarks: It was a friend of mine from college who was working for the\nForeign Office, secretly an Ml6 agent, and he approached me some\nyears after.\nWistow: Was it because of the contacts you had?\nMarks: Probably, I mean, that partly clenched it but partly it was also\nbecause they thought I was talented and could get in to areas they usually couldn't. Wistow: You have a talent you get yourself in and out of situations that\nmaybe, an ordinary person couldn't. Marks: That's all down to charm and I have that - you just be nice to pe o ple.\nWistow: How many missions did you go on for M16?\nMarks: They weren't defined as operations, it was continual work, safe-houses, false id, the kind of thing you're doing all the time as a dope dealer and which is also useful for any kind of secret transmission. Once, I was asked to seduce an employee of the Czech Embassy but she never\nshowed up at the party. I was also asked to infiltrate the IRA.\nWistow: How do you feel about the IRA as a political thing?\nMarks: As an organisation, I don't think anything can begin to justify the\nslaughter of innocents. 1 agree with their cause completely and I'd like to\nsee Ireland as one country but not with the way they're doing it.\nWistow: why do you think the DEA agent, Lavato, had so much against\nyou? You mentioned that you were dealing dope and...\nMarks: Yeah, I think all DEA agents get off on knocking you down when\nyou're having a good time and they'll use any excuse to do it really. We\nall have our sadistic side.\nWistow: why did you get into the dope dealing initially? Was there a gap\nin the market?\nMarks: No, 1 think it was much more gradual evolution than that., .the\nusual way - I wanted more drugs. At some point, it became an obvious\nmeans of getting money as I had all the usually sort of lucking problems\nHOW MANY DIFFERENT PRISON SYSTEMS HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN?\n\"ENGLAND, HOLLAND, SPAIN AND AMERICA.\"\nwith student grants - not as bad as it is now but bad enough. It was easy\nmoney.\nWistow: So you enjoyed the thrill?\nMarks: Yeah\nWistow: How hairy was it? Did you get in something where you thought\n\"Shit, I'm in trouble here.\"?\nMarks: Yeah, you know that in the end there was always the possibility\nbut you just carried on anyway even though you knew there might be several years in prison.\nWistow: Was it worth it? If you had the chance, would you do it again?\nMarks: Well, I'd miss out all the bad bits but in principle, 1 think 1 would.\nWistow: You never dealt in hard drugs like heroin or cocaine?\nMarks: No, I 've never dealt with any of those partly because I don't use\nthem.\nWistow: Thankyou very much\nHoward Marks will be at the Shepherd's Bush Empire on the 7th of\nNovember to host \"An Evening With Howard Marks\" where he will be\ntalking about his unique career in a question and answer session starting\nat 8.00pm.

    "content": "24 October 1997 MUSIC 15\nALBUMS\nROBBIE WILLIAMS Life Thru A Lens \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nRobbie shows what a young whippersnapper he can really be.\nT he grey storm clouds of Take That have finally\ndispersed and from within has shone two rays of\nlight. One is Gary Barlow who quickly found his\nfeet and the other, perhaps surprisingly, is Robbie\nWilliams.\nAfter Robbie released his first solo single Freedom,\nnobody could be blamed for thinking, \"There goes\nanother Matt Goss.\" However, since then Robbie has\nreleased some of his own material, including a couple\nof real gems. So congratulations are due for a more\nthan acceptable debut solo album - well done Robbie\net al. Yep, that's right, this album would be nowhere if\nit were not for the likes of Beck, Aerosmith and, dare\n1 say it, Gary Barlow. In fact there's even a great\nLaverne and Shirley sample on the title track for all you\nlovers of eighties daytime TV. But don't get me wrong,\nyou'll find no covers here (Freedom didn't make it\nonto the album), but to say that Robbie Williams is yet\nto find his niche within the music genre is an under-statement.\nYou'll have no doubt heard Old Before I Die, Days\nand South of the Border, and in all probability, this is\nthe style for which Robbie is headed. But this album\nseems very much a post-Take That biography, in which\nhe has used various styles to express himself. There\nare many references to his well-publicised drink and\ndrugs habit, including a track titled Clean, which needs\nno explanation, and also a poem dedicated to humiliating one of his former school teachers, which should\nraise a few smiles. Life Thru A Lens is not going to set\nyour stereo on fire, but it is an album worthy of many\na collection, however it is more likely to appeal to the\nnew breed of Brit-Pop lovers rather than those mindless Take That fans that we had grown to hate over the\npast few years. H Derek\nEMPEROR SLY\nSparking Up * * *\nVery, very heavy, fast, hard\nhouse music, most of it well\nover 160bpm, and absolutely chock full of samples, this is not\nan easy album to sit down to\nreview on a hungover Sunday\nmorning after two hours of sleep.\nDriving, threatening, and absolutely stoned off its face, the first half\nis most definitely not for the uninitiated. The pace, though, like the\nhash night which it inevitably is\nmeant to accompany, settles\ndown to a steady canter to the end\nbut still with an astonishingly high\nenergy. If the album was composed entirely of these more\npalatable eased down tracks it\nwould be a triumph, but the hard-floor stuff is a bit too much for the\nless dedicated home user.\nTechnically excellent throughout,\nand with flashes of creative brilliance. H John\nSINGLES\nThe Kings Of Infinite SpaceSlut (that I'm livin' with)\nThis is the kind of thing that teeny rock clubs\nwould go for about a year before Nevermind\nwas released. Competent enough and not so\nbad when you're pissed but then so are Oasis\nalthough they are not exactly stretching the\ngenre either.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Pizzicato Five - Mon Amour Tokyo\nMental electronic jazz with a genuine French feel\nto the singer and an obscenely happy Bangles\nmeets Bach hammond riff. A bit bloody weird to\nbe honest. But then they are Japanese, singing in\nFrench. The weirdest thing is that I like it.\nBrilliant.\nAddict - Dust\nQuiet bit. Soft gentle guitar. Nice. Chorus com-ing. Soulful Bruce Sprignsteeny bit. Pretty good\nso far... oh what are you doing with your guitar?\nLOUD BIT. Utterly unnecessary. Quiet bit. Nice\nagain. Loud bit. Still shit. If you were really sharp\non the volume control you would most likely\nenjoy this.\nMandelay - This Life\nSlightly happier trip hop than the usual fare,\nsharp strings, clipped brass and a bass so heavy\nI'm not sure my stereo likes it very much. A touch bland but better after a couple of listens.\nCandyskins - Feed It\nA gently building slice of the most saccharine\npop pie this critic can stomach. Dreadful lyrics\nand a wholly unnecessary verse song by \"sweet\"\nschoolchildren and a chord sequence that is\ndeader than Bob Carolgees' career. It's pap, but\nwell intention ed pap and more than a little\ninfectious. The drum and bass b side, Disco Hell\nis as MOR as the style can get but they really do\ntry.\nJohn\nSoul II Soul - Pleasure Dome\nNice in the way soul songs are but why do they\nalways sound the same? Lyrics are a little\nawkward.\nEther -She Could Fly\nInteresting guitar based song. Could be worse\nbut could be better. Worryingly high vocals for a male singer.\nThe Supernaturals - Prepare to Land\nSlightly rockier than normal fare from the\nSupers' whilst still keeping their trademark light\nmelodies though this is remarkably bland.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Smash Mouth - Walkin' on the Sun\nDead cool, a sort of punk version of the\nCharlatans though the b sides are much more\nstraightforward punk, especially the amusingly\nmonicker ed Sorry About Your Penis.\n3 Colours Red - This Is My Hollywood\nFairly straightforward rock but with a dark and\nmenacing air to it.

They believed\nthat all matter was evil, and that\nGod is the almighty nothingness, or\nthe celestial hilarity. If this makes\nno sense, you were not there. The\nlecture covered his experiences in\nmaking the program \"Reality on the\nRocks\", in which he attempted to\nunravel the secrets of the universe\n(or as he put it, what we are supposed to suppose about the universe this year), interviewing countless eminent scientists and mathematicians about the laws of\nphysics, and their meaning.\nHe revealed a knowledge of\nphysics that, if it did not quite\nmatch that of the audience, was\nvery substantial for a lay-person,\nand managed to have even the\nmost hardened quantum physicist\nrolling around with laughter, by\nsimply pointing out the absurdity of\nmany of the things that scientists\ntake for granted - he was particularly rude about some of the more\noutlandish suggestions for why the\nYoung's double slit experiment\nworks.\nCampbell seemed unconcerned\nat describing CERN (with which\nmany of the audience have links\nevery day) as a27 km tube of no th ing, which serves to \"waz\" nothing\ntogether to produce something. He\nhas an amazing knack of being able\nto be extremely silly about physics\nin particular, without getting many\nof his facts wrong. He just manages\nto twist them round in ways that no\none expects, like describing the\neffects of time going backwards\ntowards a big crunch on your toilet\nhabits. Don't try this at home, folks.\nHe mixed this in with anecdotes about cults and other cul-ture s, and how they view the world,\nand manage to time travel, a concept with which he seems to be\nfascinated. He also stressed his\nbelief in the importance of laughter,\nand how ultimately, being nice to\neach other will lead us to the universe that is heaven. Anyone who\nwas in the lecture theatre must\nsurely have become nearer.\nThe talk was one of a series\norganised by Bob Speer in physics,\nwhich cover all subjects in science.\nMatthew Bennett\nMicrosoft Student Software Special Offer\n***Also available to staff and research assistants at Imperial College***\nNew Products Available...\nWindows 95 AND NT Workstation 4.0 only\nWorks for Windows 95 only\nPublisher for Windows 95 only\nStill in stock...\nVisual Basic Pro AND Visual C++ Pro only\nOffice Pro 97 OR Office 4.2 for MAC only\nAll Prices Include V.A.T \u00a399.88\n\u00a399.88\nCCS SHOP\nLevel 4, Mechanical Engineering Building, ext. 46953, ccs-shop@ic.ac.uk\n9.30am5.00 pm( Wed 10.00am5.00 pm) "

College officials were\nalerted to the problem by building\ncontractors who reported an\nunusual smell in the laboratory in\nwhich they were working. The cylinders, which were not labelled, were\nidentified by technical service staff\nas containing fluorine.\nIan Gillett, College Safety\nOfficer, was called to the scene to\ninvestigate, and the fire station at\nHigh Street Kensington was\ninformed of the situation. Since no\ncollege staff have been trained in\ndealing with leaking gas cylinders,\nthe only available option was to\nmake a999 call. At around 11:30,\nseveral fire engines and an ambulance arrived at the department.\nThe building was evacuated and\nfire officers, wearing chemical protection suits, entered the laboratory to remove the cylinders, which\nwere then placed on the lawn outside the building.\nPrince Consort Road was\nclosed by the Police because of the\ncongestion caused by the large\nnumber of emergency vehicles in\nattendance. Although some considered the response of the emergency services to be heavy-hand-ed, the precautions taken by the\nfire brigade were part of standard\nprocedure for dealing with\n\"Chemical Incidents\" at College.\nProfessor Brian Morgan, Head\nof the Physics Department, said he\nwas pleased with the way that all\nthe students quickly evacuated the\nbuilding, as well as the way in\nwhich College Security handled the\nsituation.\ncontinued on page two\nResponse was 'heavy handed'.\nTHIS WEEK'S NEWS\nCHARITY EVENTS\nWild and wacky ideas from the\nRAG people...\nPage two\nIF YOU KNOCK MY DRINK\nOVER I 'LL...\nThe Rugby Captain took things into\nhis own hands.\nPage two\nNEW ELECTIONS\nTime's running out in the race for\nthe Presidency.

Enough hip\nhop lets move to aR'n' B tip and all\n1 have to say is You Make Me\nWanna, this monster comes from\nUsher and is blow in' up all over, its\nbeen number one in states for a time and look in' to do same over\nhere. His album's called My Way\nand we should be seeing it over\nhere soon. My favorite track at the\nminute is Lyden David Hall's Sexy\nCinderella. It's another bit of nu-soul but its tha bomb, so acquire\nquick. I hear he's bringing out an\nalbum but I got no details. Another\nalbum soon to drop is from a group 1 got much love for and that\nis Soul II Soul's new one called\nTime For a Change. Besides that\nnew LP's from Veronica, Taral,\nFaith Evans ik Yvette Michele are all\nmeant to drop soon, so keep an\neye out.\nLater Y 'all! 1\nAll reviews are given stars up to a maximum of five.

After being kept waiting at\nthe door while they searched\nthrough a list for our names, with\nan MTV crew getting closer all the\ntime, we were confronted with the\nbarrage of noise that was Stony\nSleep. This heavy guitar/bass thick\n3 piece had only one serious pro b lem; they weren't very good. Their\nsongs were good, but the ability\nbehind just wasn't up to it. If they\nkeep going as they are, they may\nbe great in about a year or so's time.\nAfter a quick break for a beer,\nthe schedule being very tight as it\nwas, we were pulled away from the\nbar by the chun king sounds of\nDaytona. Well not quite chun king, but trying their hardest. 1 thought\nthey were great but they seemed to\nthink they were a lot better and bigger than they were. The lead\nsinger/guitarist strutted about the\nstage like a man possessed by the\nghost of Freddie Mercury, but without the arse-wiggling. Quite a bit of\nALBUMS\nHURRICANE Severe Damage\nUde nia bly the Wu-Tang's recent Forever album was\nthe q post eagerly awaited\nalbum of its genre this year. The\nhype surrounding its release was\nlike nothing the hip-hop world had\nseen before. Next year, however,\nthe ears of the hip- hop world will\nbe tuning into the new sound of the\nBeastie Boys as their long awaited\nfollow up to /// Communication is\nreleased.\n/// Communication was the\nalbum that defined the summer of\n1994. While people talked of the\ncoming of Oasis, it was the\nBeasties who ruled the number one\nspot on everyone's playlist at the\nsummer festivals. The album\nbrought the Boys back to the big\ntime and re-invented them as pioneers in an increasingly crowded\nworld.\nYou may ask what does all this\nhave to do with Hurricane? Well\nhe's the man behind the decks pro-talent here, but the songs all\nsounded too alike, even though\nliked one song.\nRunning to the bar again we\nquickly returned to see the MC for\nthe night, who we decide c was\nsome blok e off MTV, shouting and\nwaving, and basically looking stu-pid. Eventually he introduced 'The\nKings of Infinite Space' as\nLiverpool's finest, only to be disappointed when his shout of '...any-one here from Liverpool?' was\nanswered by only one fairly pissed\nblok e, who was being held up by\nhis mates, in the most beautiful\nsouthern accent. The band themselves were quoted as saying that\nthey had influences from Abba,\nBowie and T Rex, so we braced\nourselves for a blast of Glam\nCheese. However what we got\ncould not have been more differ-ent. Aloud ish, polished set of pretty standard one guitar, loud distorted bass songs, with nothing really\nto distinguish them from any other\nband. A bit boring really.\nThe gap for the last band was\nslightly longer, but still not quite\nlong enough for more than a quick\npint. We wandered slightly less\nsteadily back into the hall, ready for\nduc inga large part of the Beastie's sound, and has been doing so since\n1988 and the not so brilliant days\nof Licenced To III. His pedigree\ndoes not, how every stop there for\nas early as 1975 he was rhyme\nfighting with the likes of\nGrandmaster Flash, and in true hiphop style he moved on to bodyguard on tour for Run DMC, which\nwas where he met up with the\nBeasties.\nAs for the music, the sound of\nthis, his second album, leaves his\nprevious, less than spectacular\nattempt in the shadows. The sound\nis altogether more wholesome than\nwhat has come before, and lessons\nhave obviously been learned about\nthe current mood. Japanese Eyes\nand Coast To Coast stand out with\na sound that takes influences from\nall corners of the hip-hop world,\nand the rest of the album does not\ndisappoint either.\nThe main problem with\nthe headlining band of the evening;\nAddict. They came on to large\napplause, especially from the\ngroup of groupie gir lies in front,\nwith tight tops and little pathetic\nrucksacks on their backs. They\nlooked like a good band. Confident\nand happy to be there, even\nthough the place was half empty.\nTheir set was well put together with\nabout half quiet, ballad y songs and\nhalf loud bouncy songs, but there\nwas just something about them.\nThey were technically very good,\ntheir songs were good, but they\njust annoyed me. And the lead\nsinger told us that they were touring with Mark Owen soon. Hooray,\nnow I have two reasons to avoid\nhim.\nAddict finished just before 11,\nand the bar closed soon after we\nbought the round. The ULU stew-ard s, in my opinion, should be\ngiven a talking to. As soon as the\nbar stopped serving they threw us\nout, and then told us off for taking\ndrinks downstairs. Never mind.\nAnd there was no free stuff, which\nalways annoys me. All in all a good\nnight out, even if the bands weren't great. H Billy\nHurricane is that he has always\nbeen an also-ran, lacking the bite\nand quality of his contemporaries.\nHis contribution to the Beasties'\nsound should not be under es tim at ed, but on his own he has never\nbeen able to quite live up to the\npromise. This album is a step for-ward, but is still not an album of the\nquality I would like.\nHurricane number one? Maybe\nnext year. Hy ames "

    "content": "24 October 1997 GAMES 19\nBUBBLE CUM\nVIRUS\nTelstar \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe back of this game's box gives\nthe impression of a virtual 'Tron'\nstyle representation of a computer\nand its files in which a devastating\nvirus must be hunted down. This,\nas an idea for a game, I think is\ngreat. So I eagerly installed the\ngame expecting a3D shoot-em up\nfrom the screenshots.\nVirus attempts to combine the\ngameplay of Descent (3D shoot-em up) and Command and\nConquer (strategic war game). The\nwhole game however takes place\nin a3 D1st person perspective,\nwhich in my opinion isn't the best\nengine for a strategic game.\nCombining these two types of\ngameplay at first sound like a brilliant stroke of genius but you\nquickly realise that compromises\nhad to be made. The action part is\npretty monotonous and there are\nnone of the weapons upgrades\nyou have become accustomed to\nin this sort of game. The Virus\nmonsters at least in the first levels\nare all very similar. The textures of\nthe levels too are all to repetitive\nand the numerous digitised voices\nsuch as 'You will be deleted' just\ndon't cut the mustard in my humble opinion.\nOne of the most innovative\nparts of the game is the way in\nwhich each level is mapped directly from your hard-drives directory\nand file structure. Certain types of\nfile are also displayed in game, so\nany of your TXT, BMP or WAV files\ncontained in the chosen directories are displayed when you enter\nthat part of the map. This is clever\nand led to the briefest of smiles as\n1 realised the games was typing\nout my SCSI card 'README.TXT'\non the screen in the middle of my\ngame, bizarre.\nI just couldn't get into the\nstrategic part of the game.\nWithout the top-down isometric\nview we have all become accustomed to for this sort of game it\njust isn't intuitive. The map is the\ndirectory structure and once I got\nused to sending a vehicle to patrol\na certain directory or file it got a little easier. The view as the vehicle auto-pilots to its destination\nisn't pretty. It jumps and\njerks everywhere crashing into\nwalls which doesn't put over that\nfinely polished touch. Also the 5\ninstallations you can build lead to\nno increase in gameplay.\nThe constraining factor to your\nbuilding is \"KBs\" not money. You\ncollect these from uncorrupted\nfiles or repaired files. The idea is to\nstop the virus and repair damaged\nfiles. If you don't do your job interesting things start to happen like\nthe display decays as your graphics drivers are infected or your\nmouse control is affected if the\nmouse driver gets it.\nThe multiplayer game sounded\ninteresting and full network play is\nsupported however I couldn't get\nanyone to play it as everyone who\nsaw it or indeed played it even for\nthe slightest moment disliked this\ngame immensely and you might\neven say irrationally. If 1 hadn't promised to review it I certainly\nwouldn't have played it for more\nthan 5 minutes. Some good ideas\nappeared throughout the game,\nand the idea is great. It could have\nbeen so so so much better. 0\nDave Morris\nPREVIEWS - CAPCOM, VIRGIN INTERACTIVE, LUCASARTS ALL AVAILABLE THIS WINTER\nMARVEL SUPER\nHEROES\nCAPCOM's number one arcade,\n2d beat'm 'up, has now entered\nthe home arena.

    "content": "24 October 1997 NEWS\nDisplaced Freshers\nReturned to Halls\nIncreased pressure of student\nnumbers this year forced the\naccommodation office into a frenzy of activity as they struggled to fulfil Imperial's guarantee\nof accommodation to its first\nyears.\nAs an emergency measure, students who could not be housed on\ncampus were given temporary\nCollege beds. According to Sharine\nBrown, Residences Manager,\ndozens of fresher s had to be transported to overspill accommodation at Clayponds, Wilson House\nand Charing Cross.\nAfter initial complaints during\nthe summer, parents were reassured that all new students would\nbe allocated a College bed. Most\nunderstood that the high student\nintake was causing severe problems. According to Senior Tutors, a significantly larger number of students were accepting College\nplaces than in previous years, leading to increased pressure on the\nAccommodation Office. This situation was exacerbated by the small\nnumber of fresher s dropping out at\nthe beginning of term.\nAlthough the chances of continuing students obtaining rooms in\nHalls this year is extremely slim, all\nfirst years will eventually be offered\nrooms in South Kensington. The\nsixteen students placed at\nClayponds and Charing Cross have\nalready been moved into Halls near\nCollege. Of the twenty-nine students at Wilson House, thirteen\nhave now also been relocated. This\nwas made possible by a number of\nstudents leaving Halls during the\nfirst week of term.\nAlthough every effort was\nmade by wardens and sub wardens to welcome the fresher s, the\naccessibility of college life enjoyed\nby most other newcomers was\ninevitably lacking; late night Union\nparties and tube travelling are less\nthan compatible. Unfortunately\nthis year's predicament is unlikely\nto be a one-off. The consequences\nof next years influx of medics have\nyet to be addressed by the accommodation office.\nMeanwhile, students are temporarily living in Montpelier Hall\nwhilst half of Southwell Hall is\nundergoing refurbishment.\nCompletion of the eighteen week\nproject is now in sight, and is\nscheduled for the end of this term.\nThe long-term future of the dilapidated Montpelier Hall, which was\ndue to close in September, still\nhangs in the balance.\nAnita Devoy and Ed Pavelin\nHigher Education:\nA Better Deal?\n\"If you're a student now, you're getting a very\nrough deal... . The new proposals are better.\"\nThese are the words of the former NUS president (84-86) and now Labour MP for Oldham\nEast and Saddleworth, Phil Woolas, in an interview with Felix.\nProspective students do not share Woolas's optimism, as shown in a recent report in The\nTimes. The study showed a marked fall in early\nUCAS applications from this time last year. Phil\nWoolas gave his explanation for this fall:\n\"There's a lot of confusion I think ... many people [prospective students] quite understandably\nthink that they're going to have to dig deep into\ntheir own pockets and pay up front.\" Asked if he\nthought that the proposals would deter\nprospective students in the long term, he said \"I don't think it will, but I 've got an open mind ...\nit shouldn't do, because the proposed system is\nfairer.\"\nThe suggestion that there was a conflict of\ninterests in being a NUS president with Labour\nin power - wanting a career in the Labour Party,\nwhile having to fight against them - was dis-missed, \"1 don't think so. Politics doesn't work\nlike that ... as a union, I think they're [the NUS]\ndoing their job very well.\"\nThere is no doubt that there is confusion\nover the proposals. Until now, students have\nnot had to pay fees, and their funding came\nfrom a combination of loans, means-tested\nmaintenance grants, and parental contributions.\nUnder the old system, the loans were not paid\nback until the graduates earned around \u00a315,\n000. A full grant was given to all students whose\nparents earned less than \u00a3 16, 500, and no grant\nwas given to those whose parents earned more\nthan around \u00a352,000.\nThe current system is by no means perfect.\nThe 1996 Policy Studies Institute found that in\n1995/6 47% of students graduated with an\naverage overdraft of \u00a32,400. The funding allocated per student has fallen by 26% since 1990,\n\"I do think it's sad that\nwhen people start out in life,\n[upon graduating] they will\nhave a debt around their\nneck of about \u00a314,000.\"\nand over a third of higher education institutions\nreported a deficit in 1995/96.\nThe new proposals were outlined in the\nDearing Report. Tuition fees of around \u00a31,000\nare paid by all but the poorest students, and\nthere will be an increased student loan avail-able, with improved pay back terms. Contrary to\nthe Dearing Report, the Government also abolished outright the current maintenance grant.\nIt is not only students and prospective students that harbour reservations over the new\nproposals. Dr. Macdonald, admissions tutor for\nImperial's Electronic Engineering department,\nthought that the more desirable universities like\nImperial would not suffer overly from a reduced\nnumber of applications, thanks to the huge\ndemand for places. He conceded, though, that\nthe \"higher universities might have to lower their\nstandards\" as a result of there being less app li cations.\nWith regard to the loans that students will\nhave to take out for fees and maintenance, Dr.\nMacdonald said \"I do think it's sad that when\npeople start out in life, [upon graduating] they\nwill have a debt around their neck of about\n\u00a3 14,000. It may be fair, but 1 think that it may\nalter the pattern of what people think they can\ndo when they graduate.\"\nThe universities themselves even look like\nlosing out. Asked if he thought the proposals\nwould give the universities a better deal, Dr.\nMcDonald said \"I don't really think it will make\nany difference. The money we get is dependent\non Government policy. The way they raise it is\nnot our business. It doesn't look as if the government is going to get much repaid for a long\ntime, ... they're not going to see that money\nfor a while.\"\nContrary to Phil Woolas's point of view, it\nseems that the students will be losing out, and\nthe universities will be no better off. The only\nwinner is apparently the government, who will\nhave slashed their total funding for higher edu-cation.\nJoseph Barton\n\n"

    "content": "8 COLUMNS 24 October 1997\nI seem to have spent far too long\nbanging on about the College so\nfar this year, giving rise to\nrumours that I have thrown in\nthe political towel. You know me\nbetter than that. Now seems the\nperfect time to resume battle as\nthe Labour government's honeymoon is rapidly ending. Not sur-pri singly, it is Gordon Brown, who\nhas shattered the dream with his\nmasterly attempt to clear up the\nconfusion over EMU that so beset\nthe Conservatives. He has succeeded. We know for certain that\nLabour haven't made their mind\nup. Hallelujah! No dithering from\nGordon. This is a perfect illustration of the perils of behaving like\nan opposition party when in\npower. The site of Brown at the\nlaunch of the new Stock Exchange\ntrading system, behind a sea of red\nof his own making, would have\nbeen hilarious, were it not for the\ndamage his naivet e had caused. It\nalso serves to highlight the disturbing reliance on spin doctors. Much\nof 'Brown Monday' was initially\ncaused by his\nspin doctor\nCharlie Whelan,\nwho like his colleagues in this\ndubious prof es sion, seem to\nwield a degree of\npower that is\ndecidedly unhealthy in a democracy. Tony\nBlair must realise\nthat, occasional-ly, government\nhave to be unpopular in the short\nterm in order to benefit the co un try. His obsession with public\nopinion and approval results in\npolicy changes on a near daily\nbasis as the mood of his focus\ngroups oscillates. As the markets\nso neatly demonstrated, this is no\nway to govern Britain.\nGod knows\nI 've tried, but I cannot let the\nConference office get away\nwithout a mention this week. It\nwould seem that\nthe Fashion week\nfiasco is not an\nisolated example\nof mismanage-ment. Regular\nf \u2014f visitors to\nPrinces Gsrdens\nwill have notice the frequent metamorphosis of the office. The latest\nof these changes was, notionally,\nto allow two more people to work\nin the office; the necessity of that\nwe shall discuss some other time.\nPinning back my ears in the SCR\nenabled me to hear the figure of\n\u00a326,000 for this project, a tad\ngenerous as I'm sure you will\nagree. Despite this larger sum,\nthey managed to spend \u00a3 152,000.\nNow I'm no expert, but that seems\na slightly larger than expected\noverspend. To be fair, they cannot\nbe accused of cutting corners. If I was buying office chairs for the 13\ninhabitants, I would expect change\nout of \u00a31,000. I'm obviously a cheapskate, since they spent\n\u00a38,000. The list is longer than\nspace here permits. This is\nabsolutely outrageous. It is sickening that, when we hear endless\nbleating from the CVCP and others\nabout a funding crisis, we see fit to\nlavish thousands on an outfit that\nin two years has lost tens of thou-sands. I rest my case.\nX We should all eat more fish. Unhygienix\nis always telling us it's good for the intelligence and he should know.\nUnfortunately, fish tends to be expensive unless you go to Bishopsgate market (London's fish wholesalers) at 4am.I went once, it was quite an experience\nand coming back on the tube with a whole crate of Dover sole was highly\namusing. However, it is at four in the\nmorning and miles from anywhere so\nyou may prefer to do your fishing closer\nto home. In which case I recommend\nyou get some mackerel. This is a very\ntasty, fatty fish which usually costs\nbetween 99p and \u00a31.20 a pound whole\n(i.e. with head and tail but frequently\ngutted). When fresh, mackerel have a shiny grey-blue skin and translucent\neyes with no white flecks. There are various ways of cooking mackerel including\nfrying and poaching but I reckon grilling\nis the best. I tried barbecue once but it\nwasn'ta great success - the buggers just\nfell apart.\nSo, here's the method for beautifully\ngrilled mackerel. Take your fish and\nclean it under running water paying special attention to the belly cavity and gills.\nIf your mackerel isn't gutted, take a sharp knife, insert the point into the fishes anus and slit the belly all the way to\nthe head. Then pull out all the 'or rib le stuff inside and clean as before. Now cut\noff all the little fins. There are two near\nthe gills, two just behind the anus and\none on the top.\nYour fish is now ready to grill but to\nadd some extra flavour I like to season it\nwith rosemary. To do this, make three or\nfour cuts perpendicular to the spine on\neach side of the poor beast y. These\nshould be quite deep but not all the way\nthrough. Now stuff copious amounts of\nrosemary into the cuts and also in the\nbelly cavity.\nNow for the grilling bit. Warm up\nyour grill on a medium heat and place\nthe mackerel under it. A half pound\nmackerel should take 10-12 minutes to\ncook so turn it over after 5-6 minutes.\nTo check whether it is cooked, slice the\nfish along the spine with a sharp knife.\nThe skin should be crispy and the flesh\nshould be opaque and come off the\nbones easily.\nTaking the bones out of a mackerel is\na piece of cake. Simply slide your knife\nall the way down the spine and then\ngently lift off the fillet. The only bones\nthat might be left are the ones that held\nthe fins on the belly. Serve with a pile of\nrice and something green and voila,\nbonne ap petit. The same method can be used on\nsalmon in which case replace the rosemary with dill and cook for 10-15 minutes on each side for a fish weighing two\npounds.\nAntoine\nm "

Editorial\nfrom previous page\nwould make no difference.\nThe point is that the Union of\nStudents is meant to be the voice\nof students in College, and is supposed to represent them and\ndefend their interests above the\ninterests of ANY other party, be it\nthe Rector, the lecturers, or who-ever, and give the views of students (all of them) in any matter\nthat affects the College. But here,\nin Imperial College of Science,\nApathy and Conformism, the\nStudent Union seems to serve the\nonly function of providing cheap\nbeer and curries, which is great,\nbut it seems to retreat when under\npressure from the governing body\nof the College, and will even act\nagainst student will at times. This\nUnion seems to take pride in being\nneutral ideologically, and not associating with students all over the\ncountry, and apparently it is not\nashamed of its lack of interest for\nstudent well being. I have never\nheard the Union's views on any-thing, and if it does have views, it\nkeeps them very quiet, and I doubt\nthey reflect the opinion of the stu-dents, since we have very few\nways of channelling our thoughts\nup to the untouchables in the\nunion office. Even if most of the\nstudents don't care about any-thing, which I doubt, we still have\nthe right to have a say in our\nStudents' Union.\nSo there you go, 1 guess 1 can\ngo get pissed and sleep through\nanother year, and wake up for the\nWorld Cup. And maybe by then we\ncan all have posters that keep the\nAnything but Students' Union satis-fie d, and we can all stroll through a walkway full of stamped posters, in\nEnglish only (because of that\nhealthy xenophobia we have to cul-t iv ate), all in their assigned places.\nAnd always remember: no sell o tape( reason yet to be discovered).\nYours truly Martin Bio2\nHello?
