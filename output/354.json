May presented eight Hungarian wines.\nHungary tends to specialise in luscious fruity wines\nbut also produces some very good drier wines, perhaps\nthe better known as Bulls Blood (Egri Bikaver) and\nPecs Riesling. The vines are mainly of French origin\nand renamed. The Balatoni Furmint was an excellent\nfull bodied white, light golden yellow in colour retaining\nboth sugar and acidity, an excellent nose, reminiscent\nof both cha blis and the riesling. A Badacsonyi Szurkebarat was lighter and more delicate with a 'steely'\nflavour and a white burgundy nose. Another facet of\nwhite Hungarian wine was revealed by Debrai Harslevelu which was sweeter with what we can now\nrecognise as the Hungarian flavour.\nTwe red wines were also represented. The Hungarian Caberrelt a very light balanced wine with a distinct bordeaux nose. This would be an ideal wine to\ndrink with a picnic in the summer and might be improved by slightly chilling. Nemes Kadar is claimed\nto be a rose but it is deeper red than most, a delicate\nwine showing a hint of strawberries with a spicy taste.\nBy it his time we were happily contemplating the\n\"King of Wines\", the famous Tokay when a quick Boglari Muskatoly surprised us all, a very feni quality\nsweet wine indeed, luscious fruity reminiscent of apricot and raisins. Tt certainly took away from the Tokay\nwhich followed.\nThe evening was rounded off by a sparkling wine\nof above average quality called Charmanit DOux.\nThe Wine Tasting Society was most impressed by\nthe quality of the Hungarian wines, it is a pity you\nmissed them. Further meetings of quality wines will\nfollow every Tuesday at 5.45 usually in Physics level\n8. There are a few vacancies left. More information\nabout the wines (i.e. purchase and tasting notes) and\nthe society are available from the chairman, T.C. Fein, bio-chemistry. We would be delighted to see you,\nexpert or novice, at any of our tasting s.j Next tasting s: \u2014Tuesday, 19th February, Sherry.\nGAYSOC\nNow that the need for a Gay Students' Society\n(Gaysoc) has been recognised by the SCC this seems\nan appropriate time to set out our aims and appeal for\nmembers.\nThe aim oj Gaysoc is to inform the her t ero sexual about the true nature of homosexuality and by doing\nthis to destroy the prejudice and ill-feeling shown\nby so many people towards gays. To this end we hold\nweekly discussions (on Wednesday evenings, in Southside bar) and occasionally invite speakers to talk on\nsubjects related to homosexuality. Everyone is invited\nto attend these meetings. We also hold social events\nsuch as parties and discos so that Gay students can\nmeet each other and have a good time.\nNew members are always welcome. So far our\nmembership includes homosexuals, bisexuals and he-t ero sexual s, male, female, British, foreign, undergraduate and postgraduate students, and members of staff.\nThe only criterion for membership is a genuine concern\nfor the plight of homosexuals \u2014 you don't have to be\ngay yourself.\nWe recognise that many gay people feel genuinely\nanxious about the consequences of the fact that they\nare gay being known in college. This is probably the\nmain reason that our membership does not already\ninclude all the 300 as so gays studying here. So that\nthese people need not feel left out we shall be holding\nour next parity in Chelsea College some time towards\nthe end of February. Meanwhile why not come to the\ndiscos in the small lounge of University College Union\n(Gower Place) on every alternative Thursday from February 7th or attend some meetings or parties of the\nUL U Gaysoc held in the Union Building, Malet Sitreet,\non Fridays.\nFurther details of the IC Gaysoc may be obtained\nfrom Dave Duce (Chem. 1) or Averil Dewing (Phy-sics 2) and of the UL U Gaysoc from the Secretary,\nGaysoc, UL U, Malet Street, WC1.\nDave Duee.\nELECTRONIC MUSIC GROUP\nThe Electronic Music Group has no lt been well\npublicised in the past and many of you hay not have\nheard of it before. We have, however, had lectures,\nvisits to recording studios and, to a certain extent,\nproduced our own music. We have not been as active\nas we would have liked in the past, due It\u00a9 the lack of a permanent synthesis er owned by the society. The syn-thesis er is an essential component in the electronic\nstudio, in fact it is the very heart of an electronic music\nsystem. The Union has now approved our application\nfor a synthesis er and we hope to create a lot of good\nmusic in the future.\nWe hope to exploit the synthesis er to the full and\nwe would like to co-operate with any college club on\njoint projects. The Jazz Club, STOIC, and the Dramatic\nSociety are already interested in the use of the syn-thesis er. We would also like to give performances of\nelectronic music (depending on the number, if any, of\nin any way inter esl ted watch the notice boards. At record evenings we play our records and discuss the\ntechniques used on them. We have been considering\nrunning teach-in sessions on the technical aspects of\nelectronic music (depending on the number, if any, of\npeople who need them), and no-one should be scared\naway by a lack of technical knowledge.\nWe are hoping to construct some equipment ourselves (a seventy walt t per channel monitor amp is under\nconsideration). If you are at all interested in electronic\nmusic come along to one of our meetings.\nThe synthesis er we hope to gelt is a VCS3. The\nbasic sound sources are three oscillators capable of\nproducing various tone colours and covering a wide\nrange of frequencies (from sub-sonic to ultra-sonic)\nand a white noise generator. Why subsonic frequencies\nsince they can't be heard? This conveniently introduces\nus to the subject of voltage control which is the principle on which modern synthesisers work. The low frequency varying voltages can be used to control other\nsynthesis er circuits. For instance, by using a slowly\nvarying signal from one oscillator to vary the frequency\nof another, a vibrato effect can be produced. Most of\nthe properties of a sound (e.g. pitch, lou nd ness, tone,\ncolour and duration of note) o an be varied by varying\nan applied voltage. This is the reason why synthesisers\nare so versatile. They can also be cont roil led by external\ninstruments such as the electric guitar.\nExamples of the ways in which the synthesis er can be used are firstly Dalek voices, which are produced by processing voices with a ring modulator. The\nsecond example is a sophisticated wah-wah effect.\n(\"Qoops. I 've sat on the cait\"). This can be produced by\na voltage controlled filter, again any circuit can supply\nthe control voltage.\nUsing all the modules in the synthesis er one can\nproduce a good approx i malt ion to al imaginable\nsounds, given enough time and a good tape recorder\n(usually available).\nSynthesisers are not just for making silly sounds,\nbut are genuine musical instruments and an integral\npart of electronic music. (If you don't think so then\nlisten to Walter Carlos' versions of Bach and Beethoven pieces).\nJimmy O 'Shea and Mark Egfcr.\nJAZZ CLUB\nAlthough Jazz Club can X claim a very large membership (about 40 at the last count), most of these members are very active. Alt present the activities of the\nclub consist of 1. playing, and 2. putting on concerts,\nalthough other events such as talks aimed at both\nthe coveted jazz man and the layman, might well be\nput on, if demand for this by members became appa r ent.\nPlaying\nThe club has its own room, conveniently located\nabove the Union bar, which is for members' use. It is\nequipped with various items \u2014 piano, trombone, double\nbass, amplification devices, and drum kit, in assorted\nstates of repair. One of the main aims of any jazz\nclub must be to encourage the formal tii on of hands\namongst the members, and the jazz room provides an\nideal rehearsal facility. There are, in fact, several\ncollege bands currently in action, spanning the field of\njazz from blues to modem jazz.\nThere are many musicians, however, in jazz club not\nyet in bands, so there is a latent talent in the college,\nfor anyone wishing to find others to form one, Drummers are especially welcomed, as our president seems\nto be the only drummer in college, and has to pour his\ntalents into four different bands! There is also ample\nopportunity for public performances in our (free)\nSunday sessions, which take place in the Lower Lounge\nevery Sunday (would you believe?). In fact if you\nare interested why no lt come along to a Sunday Session,\nand see the sort of thing that goes on?\nConcerts\nConcerts have frequently been put on this year in\nthe Biology Common Room, featuring some of the\nbiggest names in British Jazz, and happily attendance\nat these has rocketed to sixty or so \u2014\u2022 a veritable multitude at a jazz concert! Look out for more concerts\nthis term \u2014 they'll be on till the money runs out! Incidentally, the choice of who is booked for these concerts is influenced almost entirely by the views of\nmembers.\nThe Future\nConsidering the interest in blues and rock, and also\nthat there is no club catering for the playing of such\nmusic, the jazz club committee has wondered for some\ntime about enlarging the scope of the d lub to incorporate these, and related forms of music, especially in view of the current trend towards the breaking down\nof musical barriers, to quote the be s lt music papers.\nOpinions from any blues and/or rock men would be\nappreciated \u2014 we might hope to double our membership next year by It'heir addition, with the corresponding increase ih vitality within the club.\nIn the more immediate ful ture( i.e. this term), we\ncan expect to see the usual Sunday sessions \u2014 as advertised on numerous posters, and also Jazz Week \u2014 in the\npast a major non-even it, but not this year! Concerts during the week (17th24 th Feb.) will feature Modern Jazz,\nJazz-rock and Trad Jazz, in fact something for every^\none.\nMore details\nFor more details about anything, from membership\n(50p) to concerts, please contact our president, Paul\nGoose (Physics 11), either by felt lter, or better still at a Sunday session, where most, if not all, of the Jazz Club\ncommittee are usually present either playing, listening\nor drinking, not necessarily in that order.\nSteve Marshall (Deputy President)\nII.

Our Branch has existed here since 1918,!\nour Branch Rules were revised in 1970: we call a spade\na spade, we think hard and deep and long. Most of the\npoints in the 'Rector's Plan for College Development'\n(Felix January 8th) were in our Document to the College Growth Points Committee submitted in APRIL1970. We did ask the Rector to let us have in writing\nthe examples of the 'deliberate misrepresentations' to\nwhich the Rector alludes in his letter. We were not told\nwhich was the 'intemperate language' to which the\nRector referred. We understand that the sentence which\nmost shocked him was, taking it out of its context,\n\"We find it incredible that the management of this\nCollege, one of Britain's leading university colleges,\nshould act in a manner that would disgrace the most\nbackward of back street profiteers.\"\nHowever, we have now formally replied and a copy\nof our letter is enclosed. May I ask, kindly, for it to be\nprinted in your next issue of Felix.\nYours sincerely,\nH. FAIR BROTHER. Dear Sir Brian Flowers,\nMy Committee has now given a very full consideration to your letter of December 21, 1973.\nSince you took steps to ensure full publicity for your\nviews, you will, we are sure, appreciate that our reply\nmust be broadcast on exactly the same scale.\nYour letter appears to have two themes: on the one\nhand it expresses indignation and resentment at what\nyou term \"intemperate language\", and speaks of\n\"deliberate misrepresentation and crude threats\" on\nour part: on the other, it recognises that problems\nexist and suggests a willingness to seek solutions on\nyour part.\nUnfortunately, however, you did not deal with any\nof the specific complaints that we make and of Which\nyou were fully aware, since as your letter makes clear,\nthe College Secretary had reported them to you.\nWe utterly reject your assertion that we conduct\nbusiness on the basis of \"deliberate misrepresentation\".\nIndeed, had you in your letter attempted to answer our\nspecific complaints you would have found, as you worked through the points we raised, that you would not\nthen have been able to make such an astonishing\nstatement.\nOur complaints have been published and they are\nknown to yourself. Some of them concern National\nAgreements between A.S.T.M. S. and the Universities,\nwhich we claim are being broken by your admin is tra tors. Others concern purely local questions. When will\nsomething be done? Surely you do not expect us to\naccept this state of affairs without protest. Presumably\nthe \"crude threats\" to which you take such exception\nare the decisions of our members to take the normal\nsanctions which any Trade Union will apply in such\ncircumstances.\nWe met Mr. Malone on December 17th,1973 and\ndiscussed some of the outstanding questions. It is now\nalmost the end of January and only on two matters\ncan we discern movement. The first concerns a matter\non which we agreed to send in a letter which would\nbe forwarded to the appropriate College Committee.\nThe second concerns the College Training Committee.\nOur request for direct representation was answered by\na statement that our views can be conveyed to that\nCommittee and it appears that this is the best the\nCollege can offer. Possibly these kinds of barriers set\nup against us are in line with the statement in your\nletter than \"1 intend to do what I can to ensure that\nall sections contribute to the life of the College in\nthe way best suited to their talents and to the general\ngood.\" Perhaps you feel that the talents of the Technical Staff and of their representative organisation are\nsuch that on matters, which are of vital concern to\nthem . . . namely . . . their own safety at work and\nthe effective trade and professional training of their\njunior colleagues . . . they cannot make any effective\ncontribution at the Committee Table but must leave\ntheir messages at the door. We hope that we have misunderstood you.\nMany matters cover a very long span of time. The\nPersonal Case of a member in Maintenance started in\nApril 1973; a job description has been jointly produced and agreed between us, but we cannot now get\na i meeting to reach any conclusions. This, despite it\nbeing one of the matters reported to you by the College\nSecretary in \u2022 December, and despite requests for a meeting in this month of January, 1974.\nWe could go. on extensively in this vein. However\nwe note the more positive part of your letter. If it is\nyour intention to seek a better relation between the\nCollege and this Union then we for our part will\ngladly respond, but issues exist and they need dealing\nwith. Should we not jointly apply ourselves to this task?\nYours sincerely,\nH. FAIR BROTHER, Secretary\nWOTIZICWA\nLess well known as Imperial College Women's Association, I CW A is not an organisation destined\nto fight for the liberation of females at IC, nor is it\nsomething which seeks to establish and perpetuate\na WI system within college.\nI CW A exists to enhance the social life of everyone at college and holds a variety of events during\n\u2022the year. Although Mr. I CW A is the only male member of the association none of its events are exclusively for I CW A members and a happier ratio is\nfound at these than in general pertains at IC.\nThe election of Mr. I CW A1973/74 took place\nat the fresher s' dinner early last term. He was chosen\nfrom numerous IC cassa novas, some of whom are\nrenowned for their palpitating pat tell as. If perchance you find yourself in Beiilt Quadrangle next Tuesday lunchtime you will doubtless\nnotice an exceptionally high degree of humidity. The\nannual pancake race between IC Union Exec and\nICWA will be taking place and the co-operation (?)\nof all students is traditionally exp ed ted. The main event in the I CW A calendar is the\nEaster Bail! which is on Friday, 8th March. Tickets\nfor this are available to everyone and it is thus more\nlikely to be peopled by a more complete cross-sec-tion of IC characters than the C CU formal dos.\nThe I CW A lounge is situated directly above the\nUnion Bar and if you feel inclined to wander in during Friday lunchtimes and partake of a little caffeine\nsustenance you will be most welcome.\nSir,\nThe majority of students at Imperial College\nare not Communists and\nhave no interest in or\nsympathy with the Communist Party or its aims.\nThis axiom can be extended to all students in\nLondon and in Britain as\na whole with undeniable\ncertainty.\nIt is accepted by many\nstudents and others, including the Rector, that\nwe should have an increase in grants, so a campaign is mounted to\npresent our case to the\nGovernment and to win\nthe support of the people.\nBut instead of a plain,\nstraightforward procedure\nwhat do we get? We get a 'grants' campaign dressed\nup in Communist garb,\nobscuring the main issue\nwith phrases straight out\nof the Communist handbook \u2014\u2022 join the struggle,\nsmash phase 3, solidarity\nwith the miners, unite\nwith the workers and\nother corny crap.\nIs it surprising therefore\nthat only a small proportion of students in London took part in the recent demonstration? Who\nwants to march behind a Communist banner shouting 'Heath Out' when all\nwe want is a higher grant?\nIt is surely an absurd situation that our elected\n'representatives' are acting\nin a manner contrary to\nthe desires of the students.\nNot only are they doing\nus little good but could\nactually be damaging our\nclaim and certainly hardening public opinion\nagainst the students.\nWhat can we do about\nthis scarlet fever? Convince our 'leaders' they\nare way off course? Elect\nnew ones?\nOr leave things as they\nare and say deal me out?\nThis last approach\ncould have far-reaching\nconsequences on the political state of the country\n\u2014 some want it to \u2014 but\nstraightening out the campaign leaders might prove\na little difficult. Electing\nnew reps seems the only\nanswer although we could\ncome out of the frying\npan into the fire because\nthose elected are lassoed\nby the NUS with the\nCommunists pulling the\nstrings.\nIt seems like a pretty\nhopeless situation for the\nsilent majority.

The afternoon started in lively style with the men's sabre and\nthe ladies foil. The IC sabre team of Steve Thompson, Gustavo di Chapella and Roman Gomez soon\ntook the lead with Gustavo and Roman's Olympic\nexperience showing out, the results being 8 wins and\n1 defeat for IC.\nThe ladies did equally well despite their lacking a third member (come back Carol\u2014we need you), with\nKay Nicholson (2 wins) and Julia Harris, who did\nvery well to win all her fights. The result was 5 wins\nto 1 in IC's favour. This early substantial lead had\nan impressive psychological effect on King's and\ngloomy faces were to be seen in the enemy camp.\nThe men's foil followed with the IC team of Geoff\nKolbe (1 win), Julia Tyson (2 wins) and Lawrence\nBoyd (1 win) and the e pee with Steve (0 wins!),\nAndrew Barbut (1 win) and Julian (3 wins)\u2014both\nthese were much more closely fought and had it not\nbeen for our early lead would have produced a much\nmore exciting match. IC won by an overall margin\nof 21 to 12. This was was made all the more impressive because it was Kings' first defeat for two years.\nA men's second foil team was also held with Gordon Mackay (2 wins), Jon Absalom (3 wins) and\nRichard Annett (3 wins) producing a very good win\nover King's seconds.\nAfterwards we retired to a local pub where we were\nentertained, by ourselves. IC also entered a team\nfor the Sporting Record men's national foil team\nchampionship. This proved to be very great fun despite\nthe high standard of the competition. On Saturday\nwe met Stanhope ' A' team and were defeated by\n12 fights to 4, however the RAF was eliminated from\nour pool and we were through to the Sunday rounds.\nThis was by direct elimination and based on seeding\nfrom the Saturday. By the devious higher maths involved we again found ourselves against Stanhope\n'A'. Although we put up a better fight we lost at\n9 defeats to 4. We may not have the most expert team\nbut the cries of ' IC and 'Imperial' were frequently\nheard through the de Beaumont centre. The team\nwas Steve Thompson, Andrew Barbut, Richard\nAnnett and Lawrence Boyd.\nAt the end of last term the club dinner was held.\nWe decided to break away from college and went to\na hotel in Earl's Court where our ents committee\nof Chris Murray and Steve Thompson had made very\ngood arrangements and a very enjoyable evening was\nhad by all and the late licence was made good use\nof. We were especially- pleased that our instructor,\nAkos Moldoranyi, and our President, Prof. J. L. Knill\nFELIX SPORT2 EDITORIAL\nIC once again show their superiority over other\nLondon Colleges. The Rugby 1st XV have reached\nthe Gutteridge Cup Final for the 5th( correct me if\nI'm wrong) time in succession (3 wins so far). They\nmeet Royal Free Hospital in the final whom they\nhave already beaten 63-10 earlier in the season, but\nno doubt the final will be closer than that. Thanks\nto the lads who wrote the report, sorry to interrupt\nyour victory celebrations.\nThe Football 3rd XI reached the final of the Upper\nDivisions Cup for the second year running (much\nto the dismay of the 2nd XI). They have a tough\ngame against UC2 nd. Good luck in the final at Motspur Park on March 9th. The Hockey team were also playing a cup match\ntoday (Feb. 13th) but not having appeared with a match report I can only assume they either lost, and\nd aren't show their faces in the bar, or else they won\nand were too drunk to write a report. Perhaps the\npromised article will appear by next Felix. Which\nreminds me, What happened to the Badminton piece?\nI hope to receive articles from the Squash Club, Boat\nClub, and the Darts Club for the next issue. Also our\nsportswomen are going to produce something (?)\nwith a bit of luck. Contributions are required from\nall clubs, about 300 words long, has your club appeared in Felix yet? Well, don't just sit there, write\nsomething.\nFinally, a plug for the Cricket Club.

Those who had arrived at our destination in wild and woolly Wales made a further expedition into the hills, to the house of a sheep-farm-ing friend.\nBy Saturday morning the whole team had made it\nand we all rolled back down to Llangollen to have\na practice on the dreaded white-water racing course\nthat the Dee provides. The river was high, with recent\nrain and even before the 'Serpent's 'Tail' had been,\nreached, everyone had been soaked by 2 foot waves.\nThe 'Serpent's Tail' is a narrow oh an nel of water\nthrough rock, with large waves culminating in a three foot stopper which literally stops you before it\nsucks you back into itself. There are two ways through\nthis, the 'chicken shoot' or a 'quick sprint and pray'.\nSeveral paddlers swam, here and alt the following\nseries of weirs and rapids which came before the\nLlangollen Town Falls. Once there, those who were\nstill left got out and inspected the famed international\ncourse before wishing each other luck and shooting\nthe rapids (much to their own surprise and everybody\nelse s). Again a few people decided that boats were\nunnecessary including John who was just unlucky. He\nwas paddling across the finishing line which the\norganisers were still erecting, and was unfortunately\n'felled' by a waist high rope, (oops!) John's only swim\nof the weekend.\nThat afternoon was the team event, and the ' A' team managed to come 14th taking 20 mins. to\ncover the 2i mile course of hungry water. The evening was spent chasing sheep and training in the pub..\nSunday came, and with the river still high (or\npossibly higher) it was time for the individual event;\nand some people managed to finish the course. In\nfact 120 people were entered for the men's individual\nand only 58 finished. John Hubbard managed ago otl11 th place, Tim Perry 35th, and Dave Rosenthal 47th. The rest swam or chickened out. Dave and Tim\nbraved the course in new Canadian Double (thanks to\nUL U for the loan of) and twice got down the course,,\nthough pessimists thought that i they never could, to\nsucceed in getting a2nd place.\nNext year we hope to persuade Diana to get wet\nand Bob Evans to complete the course the right way\nup.

Next Issue March 5th Copy by Wednesday,\n27th February.\nCouncil Report Having been reviewing\nthe \"pop\" concerts for\nquite some time now I decided to take a step in a different direction, to expand my horizons, so to\nspeak. Now I'd never been\nto an opera before, though\nfrom the little knowledge\nI did possess I understood\nG&S to be the best in-tro duct ion, so along I went\nfor my initiation.\nOn making my way to\nmy seat I noticed that quite\na few of the audience were\nnot students. Whether\nthis was because they were\ngood dutiful friends of\nthose involved, or because\nthe name of IC Operatic\nSociety spreads far and\nwide I don't know. 1\ncould well believe the lat-ter, as everything seemed\nvery professionally done.\nThe scenery really looked\nlike trees and stone walls\nand didn't wobble on con-tact, the costume and\nmake-up was splendid, the\ntwo-dozen-or-so strong or-chest ra, dressed smartly in\nblack, accompanied ably\nthroughout, and everyone\nOn stage knew their parts\nbackwards.\nAct One was a short one,\nsituated in the castle of\nKing Hildebrand, who reminded me very much\nof King Richard III for\nsome reason. He remained\nstern and serious through-out, and, in fact, I didn't see him smile once. The\nplot was soon revealed:\nthat his son Hilarion had\nbeen betrothed to Princess\nIda, who had since renounced all men, and was\nliving in the Castle Adamant \u2014 a college for maidens who had been trained\nto think likewise.\nPrincess Ida's father,\nKing Gama, made an early\nappearance With his three\nsons, who were dressed in\narmour, and every time\nthey moved they sounded\nlike a dozen skeletons on\ntin roofs throwing empty\nbeer cans at each other.\nKing Gama (intended to\nbe a repugnant cripple,\nthough I felt rather sorry\nfor him\u2014still, I even took\npity on Galium), had a very amusing part to play\n(I especially enjoyed his\n\"grumbling song\" and his\nsons had a jolly song before being led off to the\ndungeons.\nAct Two opened in the\ngardens of Castle Adamant\nto a chorus of sweetly\nsinging maidens, belittling\nmen to record levels. The\nleading ladies were also\nsoon revealed \u2014 Lady\nPsyche, Lady Blanche\n(professor of abstract sci-en ces, and easily believed\nfrom the pompous way she\ntalked) and her daughter\nMelissa. It may well be\nmy imagination but it\nseemed to me that the less\naccomplished singers sang\nthe least serious songs\nmost. Anyway, the Princess made her entrance\nwith a fairly serious song.\nThe highlight of the\nevening for me came when\nCyril, Florian and Hilarion\nbroke into the deserted\ngardens, donned some of\nthe women's matriculating\ngowns, which just happened to be at hand and cavorted about in mock\ngrace, each having sung\nbeforehand to rapturous\napplause. Indeed, so good\nwas this that it not only\nmade the orchestra smile,\nwho must have seen it a million times already, but\nthey were forced to reenact some of it.\nThe curtains rose for\nthe third and final time to\nreveal the maidens physically prepared to defend\nthe castle against the men,\nEthiopia\nFollowing a request (by\nletter) Council agreed to\nallow the formation of an\nEthiopian Appeal Fund\nand donated \u00a310 towards\nit.\nNUS Levy\nCouncil agreed that the\nNUS 2p levy for campaign purposes should be\npaid.\nNUS Delegation\nCouncil accepted (with\namendments) a guideline\nand schedule for the organisation of the NUS delegation regarding meet-in gs, discussions, reports,\netc. It was also decided\nthat if a delegation member is unable to attend\nthen a replacement should\nnot be sent.\nStudents Radio\nCouncil agreed to send\n2 reps, to a conference of\nStudent radio representatives. Silwood\nIt was agreed that the\nlast Council of term will\nbe held at Siilwood Park\nfield station.\nFelix\nCouncil agreed to Mr.\nWadsworth's request for a12 page issue.\nDuplicators\nCouncil agreed to Mr.\nWadsworth's proposals on\nthe use and care of the\nnew Union duplicating\nmachines.\nCouncil Standing\nOrders\nAfter some discussion it\nwas agreed that in future\ndelegation of votes will\nnot be allowed. Instead,\nCouncil members will be\nable to send a representative to vote on their be-half. This representative\nto be a member of the\nsame group etc. that the\noriginal Council member\nrepresented.\nFinance\nCouncil approved the\nrequest for \u00a3270 for Radio Society for a new\nshort - wave transceiver.\nDiscussion took place on\nthe suggestion that investment be made in up to 100\npewter tankards, due to\nthe rate of increase of\ntheir cost. This was agreed\nto. It was also decided\nthat further investigations\nshould be made into buying a large stock of duplicating paper.\nDuty Officers\nMr. Sinclair was preparing a list of this term's duty officers.\nSOAS\nCouncil agreed to send\na letter of support to Miss\nGloria George, the expelled SOAS student.\nS. Africa\nThere was a brief discussion regarding firms\nwith S. African connections conducting interviews within the college\nand Mr. Phillips had prepared a draft of a letter\nthat encouraged students\nto, if possible, avoid these\nfirms.\nI. SO\nMr. Paul Flatt, one of\nthe London Student Organisation convenor s was\npresent and spoke and answered questions about\nLSO.\nUnion Floor Committee\nMr. Simmons presented\nhis report calling for the\nsetting up of a Union\nFloor Committee (not IC Floor Union Committee!)\nThere was considerable\ndiscussion on its merits\nand demerits. It was eventually agreed to set it\nup and have a review at\nthe first Council of 74/75\nsession.\nCouncil Chairman\nMr. Porter presented his\npaper suggesting that there should be a chairman of Council. His suggestion was carried nem\ncom.\nFuture Finances\nMr. Satles presented a report referring to future\nUnion organisation and\nfinancing. Council agreed,\nin principle, to the appointment of a Union\nManager and the purchase of offset litho equip-ment. It was also agreed\nthat all applications for\nequipment grants should\nbe received by the first\nweek in November of each\nyear.\nPrincess Ida WANTED:\nPAIR OF\nSTEREO\nMIC'S( JACK\nPLUG'S) FOR\nLOAN AT\nWEEKENDS\nCONTACT\nTHE ED.\nthough perhaps their mental approach left much to\nbe desired. This was displayed by some lovely acting and facial expressions\nof Melissa as she sang of\nher Views on the matter.\nCould it all end without\na fight between the men?\nOf course not, so our three\nheroes duly thrashed\nGama's three sons (having\ntrouble at times to hit\neach Other's swords), Princess Ida eventually admitted her mistake, also\nafter some good facial ex-press ions, married Hilarion\nand they all lived happy\never after \u2014\u2022 Aaah!\nG.

The Union\nre-affiliated in the year\nprior to the war but by\n1939 differences had again\noccurred. A motion by the\nIC General Committee\ndeplored the political tone\nof the NUS. Consequently IC dis-affiliated in 1940.\nIn 1948, re-affiliation was\nproposed. This was defeated on the grounds that\nNUS did nothing but\nthrow abuse and threats\nat its own country and\nthat its pol t ical leanings\nwere undesirable.\nFEBRUARY19,1959 Due to lack of copies, I was not able to find a copy of this week.\nFEBRUARY19,1964 Contrary to reports in\nSennet and the Evening\nStandard, neither the Beatles nor Gerry and the\nPacemakers have been\nbooked for this years\ncarnival.\nSports Centre\nThe University Grants\nCommittee have been\nconsidering the sports\ncentre designs since May\n1963.

This is undoubtedly a necessity, since the NUS, for all its faults, is universally recognised as the spokesman and negotiator for\nBritain's students. When the Government, mass media,\nor am industrial or other organisation want an opinion\nfrom the students, they ring up the NUS. Whether we\nU\\e the leadership or not, NUS is OUR National\nUnion. It is fortunate, indeed only natural then, that\nthere is a method for us to control the leadership of\nthe NUS. We, the students, can exercise our democratic\ncontrol over our National Union, only by putting over\nwhat we want at National Conferences. These are held\ntwice every year, and they decide the policy of the\nNUS until the next conference. Every student Union,\nSRC, or Union Society is represented at these confer-en ces. However, the only way for the conference to be\ndemocratic, sensible, and related to students, is for the\nstudents to tell their representatives what they want\ndiscussed, what point of view they want put forward\nand how they want the interests of students to be\nfurthered by the NUS. This means participating in the deciding of motions.\nHave already called one meeting of the External\nAffairs Committee to talk about the submissions. It is\nnot possible for them to go through any U GM because\nof the lack of time. It was relatively well attended, but\nI want to make it clear that these committee meetings\nare OPEN. E AC is not a club or a cu que. There is\nalready too many 'in-crowds' in IC. All are welcome,\nand all points of view must be given consideration.\nThere is, of course, an opportunity to amend the\nmotions; the amendments must be into NUS by March\n8. I hope to call an E AC this week to discuss the\nnature of these. Watch out for notices.\nFinally, do not be misled by people who say that\nNUS is the business of a few Union Officers. It is your\nUnion. It has a democratic structure. But remember\nthat with democratic rights you must also have re-sp on sibi li ties. And you have a responsibility to participate\u2014to tell your representative what you want. Let\nus know\u2014NOW. Trevor Phillips,\nE AO. PS If you have any comments, drop me a note in\nCliem 3 or the Union; or just stop me in the J CR, or\nwherever you see me.\nPostgraduate\nEducation\nConference Notes:\n1 That postgraduates carry out much of the research in\nmany departments and as such are an indispensable part of\nthe universities. Without post-graduates there would be\nlittle research in many departments.\n2. That the postgraduate is often looked upon as some\nintermediate stage between a member of staff and an under-graduate.\nThat staff and administration may often be more willing\nto listen to student views expressed by a post-graduate group\nthan by a similar undergraduate group. That post-graduate\nStudents have easier access to staff than under-graduates and\nthus have a special position that may be useful in staff-Student negotiations.\n3. That some post-graduates, unlike under-graduates,\nare in a position to take direct and effective sanctions against\nUniversity authorities and student unions should be in a position to protect any strike ad tion by PG members through\nsolidarity and regular links with Campus trade unions.\nConjernce believes: \u2014\n4. That postgraduate education is another stage in the\ndevelopment of an educated society and as such the value\nof the post-graduate Student should not be solely assessed\non the result obtained from research.\n5. That post-graduates should not he considered as cheap\nlabour for the collection of information on an in progress\nproject, but should at all times be encouraged to develop\ntheir own lines of investigation.\n6. That the value of the post-graduate students in universities Ls considerable in that they help to maintain 'the inde-pendent nature of university research, and that by carrying\nout a large part of the research allow teaching duties to be\nperformed more effectively by academic staff. Without\nQUORUM CHANGE The following change relating to the quorum of Imperial College Union Meetings will be proposed by Mr.\nN. Scdwick at the next Union General Meeting.\n1. Change quorum for general meetings from 300 to\n100.\n2. Include in para 22 \" A meeting shall be deemed\nquo rate until there is a challenge thereto.\"\nThis then means that para 2 in the standing orders\nshould be deleted and the standing orders renumbered accordingly.\nFor this to be passed it is necessary for it to gain a two-thirds majority at two union meetings not less than\n28 nor more than 40 college days apart.\npostgraduate students academic staff would have to carry\nout much more research and also have a higher teaching\nload. It is also possible that without post-graduates to continue research many staff would not take teaching posts if\nthere was no time to carry (out research in labor it aries, and\nthis could lead to decline in the standards of university\nteaching thus adversely affecting the undergraduate education\nprogramme.\n7. That post-graduates trained in industry or in conjunction with industry should be ensured of (i) a solid theoretical background in their research (ii) that their research\nwill not 'be solely dictated 'by 'Considerations arising from\nthe commercial aspects of that company, (III) that their\nresearch be allowed to develop along lines not directly\nrelated to a limited section of (the company's projects if\nsuch development is necessary for the fullest understanding\nof the post-graduate work..\n8. That where government or international agencies or\nindustrial concerns sponsor research in universities the sponsorship should not be such that the style and nature of\nthe ree arch is rigidly dictated. Neither should the research\nbe such that it will be used for military purposes, or in any\nway further the aims of projects Which will not be beneficial\ntn mankind. Further, any joint research work involving\nSouth African companies or Universities should be terminated forthwith.\n9. That all awards to post-graduates 'from industry or\nfrom any other organisation providing maintenance finances\nfor post-graduates, should be at least equal to the awards\nmade by the DES and the research councils to PGs and that\nthose awards include such items at dependant's allowances,\nand travelling expenses as determined by the relevant regulations.10. That all postgraduates places should automatically\ncarry an award provided by the DES or some other source,\nwhich will provide finance for the full period of the course.\n11. That all tuition and registration fees be paid by the\ngrant awarding body. As an immediate interim measure,\nall h tose accepted for postgraduate training and not awarded\na grant should have their tuition, registration and examination fees waived. Special emphasis should be placed on\nhaving overseas PG Students exempted from paying their\nexcessive tuition fees.\n12. That all fees and costs incurred by the students in the\npreparation of the thesis be paid for by the grant awarding\nbody.\n14. PGs should not be used as teaching assistants merely\nto relieve the load of the academic staff, but that teaching\nshould be designed and .supplemented such that the postgraduate learns teaching methods.\n15. That as not all postgraduates undertake demonstrating\nand not ail of these become teachers, teaching duties do not\nform an integral .part of the postgraduate education system,\nbut that such duties should be made available for those postgraduates who wish to undertake such duties as demonstrating and tutorial work.\n\u202216. That to prevent post-graduate Involvement in teaching\nremaining a source of cheap labour, payment for teaching\nduties should be tied to the basic rate of the University lec-tur er's pay scale.\nThat payment for demonstrating and tutoring should be\nadequate and take account of the time required for pre para tion.\nThat opportunities for demonstrating should be clearly\nadvertised and equitably distributed among post-graduates.\n17. Demonstrating at all times should be voluntary.\n18. Postgraduates should be insured against accident\nWhile at work and that the cost of such insurance be met\nby the college.\n19. That postgraduates have their national insurance\nstamps paid in full by the grant awarding body so that\nthey face no loss of benefit in later years\n20. Departments ought to provide individual working\nspace for each PG which should consist of at least a desk and\nsome storage space for filing and personal effects.\n21. Departments should make readily available access to\nthe necessary Information sources so that research is geared\nto the most recent development in the field.\n22. 'Ready and frequent discussions with the supervisor\nis essential.\n23. That there should be established in all places where\npostgraduates work a system by which the student may\nappeal against the actions of his supervisor or any other\nmember of Staff as their actions relate to the particular stu-dent.\n24. Should a supervisor be found to be inadequate then\nit must be possible for him to be replaced and account taken\nof the change in supervisor in assessment of the work done.\n24. Should a supervisor be found to be inadequate then\nit must be possible for him to be replaced and account taken\nof the change in supervisor in assessment of the work done.\n25 That all post-graduates should be involved in the\nselection of the external examiner, be informed of his or her\nidentity well in advance, and Should have the right to appeal\nagainst the application of any individual examiner. A PG\nwho, after examination is not awarded a higher degree, should\nalso have the right to appeal.\n26. Accommodation in college and university halls and\nother forms of accommodation be actually available to both\npost-graduates and under-graduates, and particular attention\nbe paid to first year post-graduates who have changed university after their first degree and to students who have\nrecently arrived from overseas.\n27. That in view of the difficulties involved in obtaining\nsuitable accommodation for married couples near many\ninstitutions of higher education, and the high proportion\nof q married post-graduates an increase should be made\nin the number of places for married couples in halls of\nresidence and student house.\n28. That post-graduates are an integral part of student\nunions.\n29. That in discussions with trade unions the emphasis\nshould be on Co-operation between the trade union and the\nstudent unions or post-graduate organisations and that the\npost-graduates themselves should always retain negotiating\nrights for their interests.\n30. That PGs Should seek representation of the bodies\nthat control the various universities with a view to ensuring\nthat staff and college administration are fully aware of the\nproblems facing post-graduates.\n31. That the NUS policy on postgraduate grants should\nbe fully supported.\n32. That the Commons' select committee's re common dat ions for loan financing of post-graduate education, and increasing overseas PG fees to \u00a31,500 is extremely unfair, and\nas such shou ll be totally opposed.\n33. Conference welcomes the fact that NUS Exec has publicly condemned the report.\n34. That loans for PG's would raise further barriers to\nworking class Students obtaining PG education and training,\nand may be used later as justification of loans for all students.\n35. Conference rejects the idea that no student be allowed\nto do PG research without experience in industry since in\nmany fields continuity of training.\nB. Overseas Graduates.\n(1) In view of the Government's plans for placing the burden of solving its economic crisis on to the working class, and\nother strata, such as students, the third report from the Expenditure Committee (Education and Art Sub-Oommittee)\nfor the es sion197374 on Postgraduate Education comes at an\nextremely opportune time for the Government.\n(2) That in view of the crisis, the report is likely to gain\nwide support from M.P.'s..1(8) The proposals in the report for supplementary loans\nfor British Post-graduates.\n(4) The proposals that graduates spend a period of a year\nin industry before starting post-graduate Studies, and that\nthose studies be more related to the needs of industry.\n(5) The proposal to cut back post-graduate numbers from\n19 per cent to 17 per cent of student numbers that given the\nproposed cut backs in total student numbers, this would\nmean a substantially larger drop in_ post-graduates.\n(6) The proposal that Overseas students' fees be raised\nfrom \u00a3250 pa. to \u00a31,500 p.a., thus making study in this\ncountry virtually impossible except for those on large sponsorships.(7) The fact that overseas students form 25 per cent of the\npostgraduates in this country.\nPolicy.\nConference welcomes the fact that:\n(1) NUS Exec, has publicly condemned the report.\nConference believes that:\n(2) CO's should initiate a campaign to show the member-ship's total opposition to (a) Cutbacks in post-graduate num-mb ers,(' b) the loan financing of post-graduate education.\nC. The tying of Post-graduate Education to the whims of\nCapitalist Industry.\n(3) NUS expresses its opposition to any increase in fees\nfor overseas students, and launch ea campaign aimed at gaining full grants for all overseas students. This camp an gn 'to be an integral part of the Grants camp an gn, with equal\npriority with all other demands. Instructions To Exec. Areas.\nCO's(1) To carry out mandate as outlined in proposals above.\n(2) To organise a delegate conference on the problems of\noverseas students.\nCO's and Arrears: (3) To take local initiatives to secure\nthese aims and publicise these alms.\nNUS. Exec. (4) To liaise with CCOSA over this campaign\nContent of\nEducation\nA. Conference notes:\n1. The rapid growth\nof higher education since\nthe War, i.e. in 1970\nthere was 677,000 full-time students at College\nand University compared\nwith 70,000 at the end of\nthe war.\n2. That during this\nrapid expansion of post-school education over the\nlast 10 years the influence\nof the State and big business has increased mark-ed ly, in the spheres of\ncourse content and subjects for research.\n3. That grants from\nindustry define the dominant areas of research in\nuniversities and poly tech nics; and that while power\nis increasingly centralised\non the governing bodies of\neducational institutions\nthe amount Of representation granted to industry\nand big business is growing rapidly.\n4. The comments of\nLord Stokes and other industrialists on the nature\nof higher education and\nthe relative merits of the\nuniversities and the ser-vices.\n5. The Russell Report,\nthe White Paper \"Educa-tion \u2014 A Framework for\nExpansion\", and the Report of the Commons Expenditure Committee on\nPG Education.\n6. That the White\nPaper represented the latest in a series of reconstructions of Higher Education designed to make\nPost - school education\nmore \"cost-effective\", i.e. more closely Itied to the\nneeds of the big monopolies i in industry.\nB. Conference recognises:1. That post school education in Britain today\nfulfills two main functions: a. Provides a highly-skilled work-force.\nb. Passing on ideas involving s tail us quo in soci-e ty.2. That during the\nrapid expansion of the\nlast 10 years in posit-school education, the influence of big-business has\nincreased markedly. This\nincreased influence is\nshown in a number of\nways, including: the fact\nthat grants from the big\nmono pli ies increasingly define areas of research,\nthat power is increasingly\ncentralised upon the governing bodies of educational institutions and that\nthere is much greater\nrepresentation of big interests on these governing\nbodies.\n3. That 'the White\nPaper \"Education \u2014 A Framework for Expansion\" represented the latest in a series of restructurings Which is designed\nto make post-school education more responsive to\nthe needs of the big mono-po lies.4. That these pressures\nfrom monopoly and state\nnot only affect the organisation of poSt-school edu-cation, but they also\npowerfully influence its\ncontent.\n5. Therefore concern\nwith the content of post-school education is a central responsibility of NUS.\nConference therefore resolves that NUS should\nlead consistent, co-ordinated analysis and activity\nabout the nature of the\neducation we receive.\nTo organise aC. Instructions:\nExec 1\none-day conference on\npressures by monopolies\nand Govt, on HE. Exec 2. To set up a working party on this\nquestion and related ones\nof state control of research and the values and\ncontent of HE. Exec 3. To produce a booklist of alternative\nworks to prevailing ortho-do xy. CO's4. To set up\nworking parties within\ndepartments or disciplines.\nCO's5. To supply material from the local situation for the conference.\n\n"

(All the backs laughed.) Following this Ray\n(I can't drop goals with my left foot) Hughes missed a drop goal by absolute miles. (In actual fact he hit the\npost.)\nDuring intensive pressure by the IC forwards there\nwas a five-yard scrum, and big Nigger (ie Oz) scored\na pushover try (Bradley didn't lift his prop off the\nground, raucous laughter). The IC team, determined\nto lead by half-time, decided to let Dave Rimmer\nhave a go at goal and against all expectation he scored\n(sorry Dave) and IC led 7\u20146 at half-time.\nAfter half-time it was so one sided that I need n't waste my breath. Dicky (Peak, Shrunker, Donkey)\nCreswell scored an excellent try which was converted\nby Dave Rimmer (if this is wrong blame Chudy). The\nscore was then 13\u20146, and the score remained so until\nthe ref, under intense pressure from supporter S. Chudy, blew the final whistle.\nIC then proceeded to their nth final on the trot\nand of course will win.\n- As everyone wanted a mention here we go:\nD. Shakesheff \u2014 Injured shoulder; M. Cotter \u2014 wan-ker and missed an easy try; Bob Stern \u2014 Crunch\ntackle (\u2014so he tells me); R. Hughes \u2014 say no more;\nFlanagan \u2014 he was too pissed to know the difference;\nT. Walton \u2014 get your hair cut; Hippo and Ugly \u2022\u2014\nthey won some line out balls; J. Hughes \u2014 he's too\nold anyway; D. Hart and Beefburger \u2014 All I need to\nsay is that they sleep in the same room in a flat!\nThis accounts for most of the team.\nBest of luck in the final!\nRIFLE CLUB\n(1) C&G vs. RCS( vs. RSM)\nThe Courtman Shield\nis a competition held annually between the constituent Colleges of Imperial College. This is\nusually run on the basis\nof the best of three mat-che s, one each week for\nthree consecutive weeks.\nIn the past few years\nGuilds have won in only\ntwo rounds, and yet again\nthey lived up to their re-put ation, the events being\non Mondays Feb 4th and\n11th. The first round\nmight as well have been\nthe last for RCS, since\nthey were sufficiently disheartened by defeat for\nthe second round to be a mere formality. (Although\nit turned out much closer\nthan was expected.) This\nyear, for the first time for\nat least five years, the\nRS M produced a 'team',\nalthough despite some clever disguises I DID notice\ns that there were in fact\nonly ever three members\nof that college ever present at one time on the\nrange! The names of their\nteam give an indication of\nthe suspicious nature of\nthe people who did shoot.\nROUND1 C& GH G.M. dark98 C. Waldron 99\nG.S. Bale 97\nV.L.C. Phillips 95\nM.J. L.

They shoot\nconsistently well in the\nNational Schools champ-ion ships, and hold the\nFELIX SPORT1 X COUNTRY\nSince the last crosscountry report raised the\ncultural level of the average Felix reader, IC Superstars (as we're known\nto our fans) have not been\nidle. On Saturday 2nd, whilst Rob Allinson was\nhaving his foot spiked\nfor UL U at BUSF\nChamps, an expedition of\nthe club's artists (i.e. any-body) took place to the\nNewland Park Relay. It\nwas not quite as difficult\nto find as anticipated,\neveryone followed Keith\nAbies, because he had the\nmap, and even knew\nwhich way up it should\nbe. However miles of road\nand a six foot fence had\nto be negotiated before we\narrived. Although only\nnine came, IC fielded two\nteams of Six, Steve Webb\nand Keith ran the 2i miles\ntwice, then our long lost\nstar Joe Keating offered\nto run for our B team, so\nthey didn't finish last\n(quite!). The A team were\njust ahead of them. As an\nact of support for the\nnoise abatement society, a very loud bell was confiscated after the race.\nWednesday saw another\nhome match, this time\nagainst UC, who despite\nonly having a few runners\n(it was pension day for\nMike Baggs) managed to\npiss all1 over us quite con-vinci n gly. Ian Ellis and\nPhil Meyler were first two\nhome for IC. However the\ntwo major events of the\nday, were the continued\ncome-back of Ian Isherwood, and the inebriation of a certain high (the\nhighest) ranking club official, who then threw his\nmaths notes about with\ngay abandon.\nOn Saturday there was\nthe annual madness of the\nSoutherns over a very\nmuddy Party Hill. Mike\n'Babyface' Welford, the\nwell known youth, came\nsomewhere out of a hell\nof a lot. ICs junior team\nfinished ninth or to put it\nanother way last. Pdte\nJohnson was last man to\nfinish only just behind\nDave 'doesn't deserve a mention this week' Pupe\nand Dave Holbrooke.\nIan Ellis was a bit further up the field. In the\nSeniors (nine miles) Steve\nWebb finished somewhere\nout of a hell of a lot more\nfollowed by Dave Jones\nand Ian Isherwood who\nthinks he was last. The\nonly bright spot of the day\nwas IC people looking\nimportant by cheering in\nMick Fuller (RCM) who\ncame 15th. Pubic apologies to Brendon and l<? hn\nCric for accusing them of\nnicking the beer that we\nnicked in Brighton, and\nwe'll try not to break any\nmore glasses.\nPAD. record score in this com-petition. So I.C. prepared\nto show them how to\nshoot on Monday 11th Feb, since they were paying -a visit to London\nfrom their home in Rutland (or has it become\nLeics., now?). The result\nwas that we beat them by\n765 points to 756. They\nclaim to have fielded a weakened team due -to a spate of flu in the school,\nbut nevertheless it was a good win, as none of us\nwas shooting particularly\nwell.\nFinally a note to long\nlost Rifle Club Members\n\u2014\u2022 the Individual Competitions, on a handicap\nbaSis where appropriate,\nwill be starting in about\nthree weeks, and they\nonly last for a week, so if\nyou want some practice,\nyou'd better get on with\nit. It is proposed to have\nsome cash prizes, as well\nas the usual Trophies for-competition.\nIf enough are interested this year, we may\nwell reintroduce the traditional drinking ceremony for the overall winner (Colin make sure\nyou're ON the beer that\nweek).\n10\nPIN\nBOWLS\nThe last match of the\n'73-'74 season was played\non Sunday at the Airport\nBowl. Despite a poor turnout by IC players the first\nteam managed to win their\ntwo points. The second\nteam were less fortunate,\nwinning their first game\nby only 5 pins, but losing\nthe other two by much the\nsame margin. The ladies\nteam, in the unfortunate\ntradition of IC was weak,\nbut also managed to Win\none game. The final score\nwas: Portsmouth Poly 8,\nIC 2.\nEven more finally, there\nis the dinner for a selected few, venue to-be ar-ranged, and it will probably be during the week\nof the 11th March. I think it's a good do!\nGORDON CLARK P.S. Vaughan, where are\nyou? I 've got some\nbills to be paid!\nFOOTBALL\nTHIRDS TO\nFINAL\nCup semi-final:\nIC III 2 Birkbeck II 0\nIC V0U C II 6\nIn a repeat of last year's final, IC thirds were drawn\nagainst Birkbeck Seconds in the semi-final last Saturday at Kings ground. IC won the toss and elected to\nplay with the wind in the first half. The Thirds had\nthe better of the opening minutes and took an early\nlead. From a shot (centre?) the ball rebounded off\nBirkbeck's goalkeeper for Rob Holmes to nip in and\nscore. IC increased their lead after twenty-five minutes\nwhen a throw-in was headed on by Tony Richards for\nMike Butterworth to score.\nIn the second half, playing now against a gale force\nwind, IC got completely on top and should have\nincreased their lead, but a Tony Richards penalty was\nbrilliantly saved by the Birkbeck goalkeeper. IC kept\nup the pressure and would have won by a higher\nscore but for several fine saves by the opposing goal-keeper.\nThe defence played well throughout the game and\nIan McDermott and Rob Holmes had excellent games.\nTeam: Gerwyn Edwards, Chris Anastasi, Rick Perret, Andy Jackson (capt.), Jim Isley, lan McDermott,\nTony Richards, Mike Jakeman, Rob Holmes, Mike\nButtercup, Phil Singleton. Sub lan Hyslop.\nMeanwhile at Birkbeck hopes of an all IC final\nvanished. Unaccustomed to an oval ball IC found\nthemselves two down after ten minutes. A very enthusiastic Fifth team fought hard with Brian Cassey having\na good game on the wing. It wasn't until the final\nfifteen minutes that they were overwhelmed.\nTeam: Rob Colston, Tony Wilkinson (capt), Denis\nCraig, Roger Hunter, Alan Wilkinson, Ken Cowan, A. Handa, Rob Mills, Brian Causey, Ian Hasswell, S. Dhillon.\nThe thirds now take on UC seconds in the final at\nMotspur Park on Saturday 9th March. Free coaches\nwill be available for supporters. The third team deserve\ntheir success this year. They have twice beaten the\nsecond team (Never mind Alan). Their defence is\nsolid and ever reliable, the midfield is skilful and\ndetermined and the forwards shooting is deadly. Andy\nJackson as captain has been an inspiration to all.\nPete Davies\nUnequivocal Equality ICI II lI C II1 Of the three epic confrontations twix t these two\nambitious bodies of men, this was by far the most\nsignificant. Unlike previous encounters, on this momentous occasion (15 down, a nag), element wise everything\nwas A OK( colloquialism (colonial))\nThe opening instinctive parry and thrust were so\nfluid that onlookers (Mr. Thrib and dog (mongrel with\nterrier extractions)) were positive that all had been\nrehearsed. To quote Mr. Thrib, \"int' first arf, t 'eds was\nwell on top.Ic anna' ft' life o 'me com pre 'end 'ow\nt 'blues was a 'ed at 'arf time.\" The undeserved penalty to which Mr. Thrib so eloquently referred, was donated by the ref. (Neasden's school for the blind) with but a meagre three seconds\nto go. This injustice was not without repercussions (or\nre woodwinds). The normally subtle, delicate, controlled\nfootwork of Karol Senkiw was supplemented by certain\nhomicidal tendencies. Mick Butterworth (whose dive\ncaused the controversy) was mistaken by Mr. Senkiw\n(patent pending) for Ian McDermott, the latter spending most of the 2nd half in orbit.\nThe telepathic congress realised within the 2nds in\ntheir crushing of QE C2, again came to their aid\ntowards the end of the 2nd half, the 3rds, pushed back\non their heels by the 2nd s(t 'reds \u2014 E. Thrib), superhuman pressure were left breathless by the crisp, in ci sive, simplicity of the reds equalise r. Ashen lipped,\ntight faced Alan Peterson (83), took a corner so cunningly deceptive that the 3rds defence thought the danger had passed. The desired complacence allowed Rob\nYoung (chief 'offender' in the earlier sequence) to cross\na perfectly flight ed ground pass which Martin Clark\neloquently allowed to roll between his knees. A mercurial flash was upon the loose ball instantly, leaving\nAndy Jackson scything at thin air, and pausing merely\nto assess the most aesthetically satisfying point at which\nthe ball should enter the net, the flasher (alias Bob Day\n-\u2014Sports Ed.) mis kicked it past flailing Andy Roberts.\nJustice was done, Mr. Thrib re-awoke, his plaudits\nechoed as the setting sun highlighted the blood on Mr.\nSenkiw's boots, and the understandably biased referee\nblew the third of his final whistles. The conflict is\npast; only the recurrent pettiness of Arkle towards\nClarkle (and vice-versa) will remain to perpetuate the\nmemory of this tribute to incoherent, inhumane, vio-len ce. God must decide twix tv end i cat or and vindicated.\nA.N. Other\n\n"

Heath's rigid stand\n\u2014 to the extent of imposing a lock out on the rest\nof the working class of\nthis country \u2014 typifies\nwhat is wrong with the\nGovernment. Even Tory\nindustrialists are finding\nHeath's inflexibility hard\nto swallow, as the \u00a380,000\na day offer by Mr. Bradman showed. But the\nthree day week has only\ncompounded an already\nbad situation, of soaring\ninflation, massive balance\nof payments deficit, wages\nheld back while prices\nrise.\nTlie Housing Finance\nAct and the Industrial\nRelations Act had the intended effect in the first\nperiod of Tory govern-ment, of dividing the\nworking class against\nitself But with unity re-turning, the stock market falling and oil prices ris-ing, Heath found himself\nunable to hold his own\nagainst his problems, and\nso ran away.\nThis election is basically about democracy,\njustice, and socialism. We\nhave seen an arb it ary Government invite Solzhenitzen, the Soviet diss i dent, to this country,\nw hi'e deporting Chilean\nrefugees, and decreeing\nthat the rights of people\nagainst planners should\nbe disregarded in the case\nof the Scottish oil platforms \u2014 to say nothing\nof the dictate which has\nreduced the working\nweek, and thus the wages\nOf working people.\nThe Tory election manifesto goes further along\nthat road. They will\ndecree, if they are re-turned, that unfurnished\ntenants who live in the\nsame house as their landlord are no longer to\nhave security of tenure \u2014\nthough any local councillor will tell you that such\ntenants are the ones who\nhave major problems in\npersuading their landlords\nto do proper repairs and\nmaintenance. Now, if they\ncall in the Public Health\ndepartment, under the\nTory proposals they will\nbe out on the street.\nThe Tories propose to\nremove the right to social\nsecurity benefit from strikers and their families \u2014\nalthough the benefit is\npaid for by the workers\nthemselves partly straight\nfrom their wage packet,\npartly from the turnover\nSue Ward, Chelsea their labour produces.\nThey \"will examine further means of controlling\nthe rise in prices of key\nitems of food\" \u2014 a promise that they ought to\nbe able to keep, since it\nmeans nothing.\nWhat is there to make\none vote Labour rather\nthan abstain, vote Liberal,\nor vote for a minority\ncandidate? Such action,\nof course, is not a waste\nof a vote \u2014 it is a vote\nfor the Tories. If you\nwant to put the Tories\nback into power, go\nahead.\nThe Labour Party's period of office 1964-70\nleft many people feeling\ndisillusioned and believing a Labour govern mrt would always be dominated by the Treasury. Will\nthis be the same again?\nI do not believe it would\n\u2014 the Party has learnt\nfrom experience, and\nthere is a strong determination at the grass\nroots of the Party never\nto let it be \"blown off\ncourse\" again. Conference\nhas been swinging steadily left since 1970, and\nthere is a real will to bind\nthe Parliamentary party\nto conference decisions.\nA Labour Government\nwill face a tremendously\ndifficult time. We have\nno doubt that there will\nbe problems, and that\neven redeeming our promise to put up pensions\nimmediately will not be\neasy. But it is possible to\ncut back on inflation \u2014\n?\nas John Palmer showed,in\nthe Guardian on Feb 13,\nup to 75% of commodity\nprice rises have been caused by speculators moving into these markets \u2014*\nthe disease is carried by\nparasites endemic to the\ncapitalist system, at least\nas much as by the onion\nfly or potato blight. It is\npossible to stop property\nspeculation, by national-ising development land,\nas the Labour Party is\npledged to do. It is possible to tax the wealthy to\npay for this \u2014 if you tax\nreal wealth, and capital,\nyou can get far more than\nthe \u00a3400m. Torty Barber\nhas suggested as the max-i mum, because he has\nonly looked at income.\nThere is plenty of wealth\nand capital salted away in\nour grossly unequal soci-e ty. This is a crisis election\nin a time of crisis. Five\nmore years of Tory Government would be disastrous. Even a year of\nvague government, with\nno one party holding an\nabsolute majority, would\nbe worse. The only tiling\nthat can take us forward\nto a just and equal society\nis a strong Socialist gov-ern ment. GENERAL ELECTION Whilst arranging the meeting to be held in the Great\nHall today at 1.00 p.m. it seemed an eminently good\nidea to ask each speaker to write an article for publication in Felix.; These are general articles dealing with\nthe poKe ies of the three main parties and not with\nspecifically local issues. Read them, take note of what\nthey say and don't forget to come along to the meeting\nin the Great Hall. Written questions please by 11.30\nto the Union Office, Beit Building.\nPAW.\nTory Fundamentals\nThis Election has been\nprecipitated by the crisis\nsituation whereby a tiny\nminority of politically\nmotivated extremists are\nresponsible for the use of\nindustrial force in an\nattempt to torpedo the\nfight against inflation by\na democratically elected\nGovernment. In such circumstances the will of the\nnation must be made plain\nand it is to be hoped that\nwhen this has been done,\nthere will be a new climate in Which the voices of\nmoderation lead to a settlement. However, the\nminers' strike is not the\nonly issue. An Election is\na choice between differing\nconcepts of life and it is\nuseful therefore to restate\nnow the basic Tory philo-soph y. First\u2014'Man cannot be\nmade perfect by human\naction \u2014 Private relationships are difficult to regulate by law and it is futile\nto assume that social improvements alone will\nalter .behaviour.\nSecond\u2014Man does not\nlive alone\u2014(but in a Society whose first need is the\npreservation of order.\nOrder will !be difficult to\nmaintain if the organs of\nsociety do not work justly,\nbut justice is impossible\nwithout order. For years\nwe have let woolly liberal\ntheories make us soft and\nsome sharp shocks may be\nnecessary for the modern\nunruly, if a sane society is\nto be rebuilt.\nThird\u2014The true life of\nthe Community is to be\nfound in the natural\ngroupings within society\u2014j family, occupational association, church, nation\nand any wider culture of\nwhich that nation may be\npart. Attempts to disrupt\nsuch natural ties should he\nresisted, especially when\nthe education process is\nbeing perverted to overthrow the basis of society.\nFourth\u2014Society is not\nstatic\u2014but to be healthy\nmust develop organically\nrather than by revolutions. Rulers are trustees\nof the past and for the\nfuture. This involves\ngreater care for our environment as well as\nhealthy scepticism about\nthe wis do lm of replacing\ninstitutions of proven\nworth with ephemeral products of trendy theories.\nFifth\u2014Economics is a tool not a master\u2014Economic dogmas whether\ncapitalist or socialist are\nto be treated accordingly.\nTimes change and while\nsometimes more intervention in the operation of a free market is needed, at\nother times it should be\nless. No \" U\" turns are in-vol ved: those who think\nthey are have a fallacious\nview of Toryism in the\nfirst place.\nSixth\u2014The organs of\nsociety must control the\nlife of the community in\nthe interests of the whole\nfor the betterment of the\nlot of all members as opposed to separate parts.\nTory philosophy has always advocated state intervention to help the\nweak and needy.\nSeventh\u2014A well ordered community will provide a framework for the\nmaximum development of\nindividual personality \u2014\nPrivate property is not\nsacrosanct above the\nneeds of the community\nbut it is justified as a means of developing the\nindividual personality, the\nsafeguard of the family,\nan incentive to production\nand increase of wealth,\nand a natural bulwark of\nliberty. Attacks on it\nwhether from public or\nprivate corporations are\nsuspect.\nEighth\u2014If power (poli-t ical and economic) and\nauthority are not to be\nabused, they must be\nspread as widely as possible throughout the community \u2014\u2022 If we wish to\npreserve the concept of\none nation it needs to be\nmade a reality by involving to the fullest the ordinary people in the affairs\nof the community. In so\ndoing we maintain the\ntradition of Disraeli, the\nlater Churchills and Macmillan. It remains the\nbest, the middle way, for\nthe country.\nRobert Parsons, Holborn and St. Pancras The Liberal Party manifesto \"Forward with the\nLiberals\" gives a clue to\nthe strength and resilience\nOf the revival of the\nLiberal Party and why\nthis is gathering momentum day by day. Liberal\npolicy is not simply some\nmiddle of the road between the Tories on the\nright and Labour on the\nleft. It is at the same time\nmore constructive than\nlo ry policy and more\nradical than Labour. During the last year there has\nbeen a dramatic change in\nthe British political scene\nwhich has not yet been\nfully perceived. Previous\nelections and changes of\ngovernment had seen two\nmajor parties moving\ncloser together as they\nvied with each other for\nthe expanding middle class\nvote. Industries were de-nationalised and re-nat-ional is ed. British society\ncontinued to be characterized by sharper class\ndivisions and inequalities\nin incomes and wealth\nthan in any other country\namong the major industrialised nations. But\nwhen, due to years of\nneglect, our deteriorating\nindustrial relations led to\nincreasingly inflationary\nwage demands and increasingly damaging industrial disruption, culminating in the Government's self-imposed 3-day\nweek, the Tories and\nLabour moved back into\ndiametrically opposed\ncamps.\nIn an address to the\nLiberal Summer School at\nCambridge in 1925, J. M. Keynes asked the question that faces the British\nelectorate now; whether\nthere was any room for a party disinterested as between classes which would\nbe free in building the\nfuture from the Die-hard is m of the Tories and from\nthe Catastrophism of Labour each of which spoil\nthe constructions of the\nother. He answered in the\naffirmative, but at no\ntime has it been so vital\nto re-establish the voice of\nreason as now. Until recently it was possible for\npeople of Liberal persuasion to find a political\nhome in the wing of one\nof the other two parties.\nThis is no longer the case.\nAt that time the Liberal\nParty did not appear to be\na viable political force.\nThis is not true today. We\nbelieve that by failing to\nlegislate for a society that\nis fair the Tories have lost\nthe confidence of working\npeople and that if returned to power would be\nfaced with the worst industrial strife since the\nwar. But equally a Labour\nvictory would spell economic ruin. Labour has\nbecome extremely illiberal; falling into the\nhands of the leadership of\nthe most powerful trade\nunions and turning its\nback on the benefits of\neconomic growth to be\nhad from the expanded\nmarket of the E.E.C. Liberals are facing\nsquarely the fundamental\nproblems of our day. We\nare concerned to combine\nthe maximum freedom for\nthe individual with protection against the exercise\nof one person's freedom\ninfringing the freedom of\nothers. We are concerned\nto establish a society that\nis fair. On industrial relations we have consistently\nadvocated Industrial Partnership since the famous\nLiberal Yellow Book of\n1928. The monopoly powers of trade unions will\nhave to be restrained but\nthis will only be achieved\nin return for greater participation in industry and\na fairer distribution of\nwealth. The latter could\nbe achieved by the progressive issue of shares\nor equivalent production\nlinked agreements to em-ploy ees. Employees would\nthen have an incentive to\nwork more effectively and\nat last we would be working with each other rather\nthan against each other\nas we have done under the\nlast thirty years of Tory\nand Labour rule. Liberal\nleadership in Community\nPolitics has also demonstrated that we are prepared and able to translate\nour concern for people's rights into practical re-sul ts. The Liberal revival\nstarted with radical politics and students' concern\nto get something done.\nNow it is the students'\nturn to respond; to reject\nthe old classification of\nleft and right; and to help\nus unite this country.\nPUBLICITY\nHave you ever wondered if the Union ever does\nanything? You never see\nany posters do you? In\nfact, the publicity department in this college is\npretty useless isn't it?\nGood! I'm glad you\nagree but I am trying\nhard to improve the situ a tion. However one of my\nbiggest problems is distribution. Coming straight to the\npoint I need volunteers to\npin up posters. Nobody\nwill be asked to go out of\ntheir way at all, posters\nand pins will be delivered\nto you personally, one\nposter per person, and you\nwould be asked to pin it\nup on a notice board you\npass regularly.\nSo if you want to help\nsend a note to the Imperial College Union\n(Publicity Dept.), by internal mail, i.e. hand it to\na college messenger, or\njust drop it into the office\nin the Beit archway. Include details of notice\nboards you pass daily in\ncollege, hall, bars, etc. and\nyour address and department so that I can contact you, and before I forget your name would be\nuseful as well!\nThanks Rup.\n\n"

Why the Hell should\nI have to waste my time\nsorting out members of\nthe public who inform me\nthat our students have\nbeen disturbing them?\nWhy should I have to\nspend hours trying to explain that the reason that\nthe Union lift is not work-ing, and has not been since\nbefore Christmas, is because some fool decided\nthat he wanted the control\npanel as a souvenir of the\nvaluable work which he\nhas done for the Union!\nI do not believe that it\n5s a majority of our students who are creating\nthese problems, but what\nis important is that the few\nare creating a very bad\nimage for the whole.\nIf you want to help to\nimprove our image, then\nplease try to keep your imbecile friends under some\nsort of control.\nElections \u2022\u2014 Internal\nFollowing on from the\nabove, it is perhaps an appropriate switch to move\non to the topic of student\nleaders for next year.\nAs you may or may not\nknow, this term we elect\nthe Union officers for next\nyear. You may for many\nreasons read this and\nmerely say \"Boring\" (as\nthe typical I.C. student is\napt to say about anything\nwhich he/she does not un-der stand), but if you do,\nthen I am afraid that you\nwill get just what you de-serve,\nALL the Union officers\nhave a representative role\nto play during their year\nof office, and it is up to\nyou to make sure that the\nleaders are representing\nyour views, otherwise you\nhave no comeback (as in\nthe case of N.U.S.) with the\ndecisions which are made\nif they are in direct opposition to your own views.\nWhat you may be saying\nto yourself (if you are\nthinking about the problem\nat all) is \"O.K., so I 'll\ncome out and vote, but\nwhat if no one stands for\nthe job?\" All that I can\nsay to that is that none of\nthe Union posts (except\nsabbaticals) take up a great\ndeal of time \u2014 if they are\ndone properly and efficiently \u2014 so why don't you\nstand for one? It doesn't cost anything, and you\nnever know, you may be\nable to help the Union in\nyour own way.\n. If you would like, in any\nway, to help the Union\nto function next year then\ngo as soon as possible \u2014\nto see the relevant Union\nofficer for this year, and\nI am sure that they would\nbe only too happy to give\nyou all the information on\nwhat their job entails, then\nall that you need to do is\nto convince the relevant\ngroup of people that you\nreally are the person to do\nthe job for which you are\nFIREHOSE S The annual testing of the Union fire hoses will take\nplace on Tuesday, 26th February, during the lunch\nbreak. Coincidentally this coincides with Shrove Tuesday. Because of this there is a strong possibility that\nthere will also be the annual Shrove Tuesday pancake race, also round the Beit quadrangle. (Funny how\nall three always seem to co inside \u2014Ed.). Whether you\nmake a bee-line for the quadrangle at this time, or\navoid it like the plague is up to you. However, fair\nwarning must be given that there is likely to be a very\nlocalised, extremely heavy period of rain (!?) in that\nvicinity at or about the lunch^time period. The Union\nwill not accept any liability for person or persons\ncaught in this unfortunate freak weather condition.\nstanding, and they will vote\nfor you.\nElectionns \u2014 External\nAs I am sure that you\nall know, there is a General\nElection on the 28th of\nthis month, and once again\nI hope that you will all go\nout and vote in the way\nwhich you fed will do the\nmost for the student body\nas a whole. I am not\ngoing to put out all the\ntypical crap telling you to\nforce the present Government, to^give way to another equally biased one,\nas this decision is for you\nto make.

    "content": "February 19th*1974 FELIX Page\nUNMARRIED\nSTUDENT MOTHERS\nThe NUS and the National Council for OneParent Families are gravely concerned that the new\nHardship Scheme for the dependants of students,\nintroduced by the DES last July, discriminates against\nthe single (unmarried) mother and her dependants.\nThere are very serious defects for her and her child\nin the new mandatory arrangements for students'\ndependants. A divorced, separated or widowed mother\nwith one child, Who married before her course began,\nmay claim up to \u00a3350 allowance or may opt for a special disregard of income. A mother in exactly the\nsame position but who has never been married can\n! claim only \u00a3144.30. This is blatant discrimination\nI against the single (unmarried) mother and her child.\nThe NUS and One-Parent Families call upon the\nGovernment to review the grant arrangements for\n! one-parent families so that the single (unmarried)\nmother or the unmarried father bringing up his child\n| may claim the full child allowance, the extra personal\nallowance of \u00a3100 available to divorced or separated\nmothers or the special disregard of income. We also\nrequest that financial help be given towards the extra\nunavoidable costs which these families incur, such as\nthe cost of child care.\nDEMONSTRATION\nFebruary 8th and NUS National Demonstration\nDay. Funny, I must be in the wrong place. Surely\nmore than 70 people at Imperial College care enough\nabout their grants to protest about their low level. No!\nObviously no more are expected as Norm is sending\nus all down to the Tube station.\nEmerging out of the Tube again and approaching\nthe demonstration. My, aren't there a lot of people.\nMore than I 've ever seen on a student demonstration\nbefore (though small compared to the TUC demonstration of 150,000 some time ago). They seem very\npeaceful though. Just as well, in fact, as the DES\nheadquarters are within storming distance and not\nvery well guarded by police at that.\nStarting off and that's the front of the procession\nthat 1 can see ahead. No sign of the rear end however.\nWalking past the DES, I wonder if SHE's there, in\nOne of the top windows watching. Unlikely. She's \u2022probably enjoying a highly sub sidi sed meal in the\nHouse.\nVery quiet this time \"Give me aG.... Give me\nan R....\" etc., \"What does it all spell? F***all....\" Strange how one's ideas change.I always thought\nthat most higher education students could at least spell\nsimpler words.\n\"Get back to work!\" shouts a worker from one of\n\u2022he offices. Cries of \"F*** off\" (not sensible), and\n\"What would you do if you weren't being paid enough\nio live on\" (sensible).\nHyde Park and cries from the platform of \"They're\nstill pouring out of Oxford Street. There's no end to\n*he demonstration\". 25,000 to 30,000 students waiting\nto hear . . . Miner, building worker, Labour M.P.... \"Solidarity . . . struggle . . . support . . . strike . . .\n\"picketing . . . Funny sort of GRANTS demonstration.\nAt last, John Randall, our glorious (?) leader. Not so\nmany boos as I thought there would be, though LSE are making themselves heard (as usual).\nBanner folded up, long trip home for some (Ire-land, Scotland, Wales). Press coverage the next day.\nGuardian carried a photo of Korean students demonstrating . . . in Korea.\nOVERSEAS\nSTUDENTS'\nHOME BASED\nDISCRIMINATION\nA Mr. Imman studying\nMaths and computers at\nSouthampton College of\nTechnology, who has been\nin England since 1966,\nwent to Denmark for a Christmas break. On\nreturning after Christmas\nhe was stopped at Gatwick and sent back to\nCopenhagen. Copenhagen\nrefused to take him, and\nhe was returned to Gatwick again. He was sent to\nthe \"Beehive detention\nsuite\" and was left there\nuntil January 25th when\nafter his case had been considered by the Home Office he was flown to\nBangladesh. He has never\nlived in Bangladesh. The\nreason given was that he\nhad \"a lack of incentive\nto return home after his\nstudies\". If he wishes to\nappeal against this, he will\nhave to do so from Bangladesh. An appeal from\nBangladesh may take up to\na year to arrange.\nMr. Carr's speech on\nimmigration in the House\nof Commons in December\nseems already to have had\nan effect. He then referred\nto the danger of overseas\nstudents seeing studying\nas. \"a backdoor way of\nevading all immigration\ncontrol\", He talked of\nstudents \"spinning out\ntheir course, more with the intention of staying in\nthis country, than of\nseriously obtaining good qualifications\". The Government wishes to place\ncontrol on the total length\nof time a student may\n' spend here and on movement from course to\ncourse; to increase the\nminimum number of\nhours per week necessary\nfor student status (at\npresent 15 hours a week);\nand to obtain more regular and frequent reports\nfrom institutions where\nstudents are working.\nThese controls coupled\nwith the recent report by\nthe Parliamentary Expenditure Committee, which advocated charging overseas postgraduate students\nthe full costs of their courses, which would be\nin the region of \u00a31,500 a year, will add to the problems that overseas students in this country\nalready experience.\nACCOMMODATION\nQUESTIONNAIRE\nThose of you living in\naccommodation other than\nHalls of Residence, Union\nFlats or Student Houses\nwill shortly be receiving a questionnaire which is\naimed at providing information on the various\ntypes of accommodation\noccupied by Imperial College students. The questionnaire will endeavour to\ndiscover, amongst other\nthings, what sort of\naccommodation you are\nliving in, whether you are\nsatisfied with it, any restrictions imposed by the landlord and whether the\nlandlord will accept an\nincrease in I.C. students\nnext session. It is intended\nto draw up a register of\naccommodation available.\nThe questionnaire will go\na long way to providing\nthe information only if a large enough section of\nT.C. participates. So, when\nyou receive it, please\noblige the college and the\nunion by taking a few\nminutes off work to fill it\nin.\nKEITH A RUN DALE( Student Residence\nOfficer)\nSTUDENTS?\nSince October 1973, the\nUCC A form (remember\nthat?) has invited applicants to indicate whether\nthey live close enough to\none of their chosen universities to live at home\nduring their degree\ncourse.\nGiving evidence before\nthe education and the\narts sub-committee of the\nCommons Expenditure\nCommittee, Mr. Ralph\nToomey, under-secretary,\nDES universities branch,\nagreed this information\nmight tip the balance of\nchoice between two otherwise equal candidates towards the one who could\nlive at home.\nIt seems that the Government (as was) were\ntrying to implement the\n1972 White Paper, and\nthat the universities are\nshowing more sympathy\ntowards the proposals. All is not working as they\nwould like, however, as\nsome schools, realizing\nthe implications of the\nquestion, are instructing\ntheir pupils not to complete this section on the\nform.\nPARTY\nSPEECH\n\"Hello, good afternoon, this is your local, er . . . .\nwhere are my notes . . . . er . . . . Labour Party\ncandidate.\" (I must remember it's Labour this time,\nI was a Liberal last time and a Tory before that, it's all the same really but it doesn't do well to let the\nelectorate know that). \"I hope you'll all be voting\nLabour on Thursday 28th and put an end to this\nTory misrule.\"\n\"What do we promise, you ask? That's easy, we're\ngood at promises. Well first of all we'll stop strikes.\nThe Tories can't do that, the workers can see that\nthe Tories are against them. The unions will accept\nour promises. I know that we can't give them anything but it'll take a while for them to realise that.\nWe'll have a Prices and Incomes policy and if they\ndon't like it we can always send the troops in. After\nall we did that in 1966 in the seamen's strike, though\nit's better not to remind people of that. I know it\nsounds a bit like Tory policy but at least we can\npretend that we're acting in the interests of the\npeople.\n\"Then we'll solve the economic crisis. Don't ask\nhow, I'm not an economist. I'm sure someone will\nthin ik of something. Anyway it sounds good.\n\"What about the Common Market? Well, we're\nwaiting for the result of a special opinion poll before\nwe make up our minds on that one. Remember we\nwant to get elected.\n\" And don't forget our nationalisation programme.\nWe'll run every industry as efficiently as the Post\nOffice and make as much profit at the National Coal\nBoard. No . . . . wait a moment . . . . that's wrong,\ner . . . . well, nationalisation's good, I just can't remember why.\n\"Student grants? Well NUS is telling students to\nvote Labour already so we need n't promise anything\nthere. We gave students 6% in 1968. I know they\nwere supposed to have got 12% but they've probably\nforgotten that now.\n\"Not that it really matters. Once we're in we can\nforget all our promises and get down to the business\nof ruling the country. It doesn't matter who gets in\nreally. Whoever it is is going to have to take strong\nmeasures to preserve the capitalist system and prevent workers getting decent wages. Though we've\ngot to make it look like there's a choice or the\nworkers might get wise to the fact that they don't need the capitalist system and then where would we\nbe? I'd lose my high salary for a start. Of course\nall the Trotskyists and Communist Party people are\ntelling the workers to vote Labour. That helps. They\ncan always be counted on to support capitalism in the\nend. Anyway that's enough for now. Vote Labour\nand perhaps this time Til get elected.\n\"This is your local Labour Party candidate. (I 've\ngot it right this time). Good-bye for now\".\n(by Kathleen Corcoran)\nRCC\nGeneral\nMeeting\n21 FEB1974( THURSDAY)6.00 pm SCC Room\n\n"

A sad\noccasion in some ways, but with various\npleasant surprises, probably the most\nno l table being the appearance of Ashley\nHutchins \u2014 bass player from Steeleye\nSpan, Fairport Convention, and the\nAlbion Country Band amongst others,\nfor those of you who like myself I'm ashamed to say were ignorant of this\nfact.\nThere was an abundance of floor-sin-gers, several newcomers to our club. Mr.\nGladstone's Bag \u2014 two friends of Shirley and Dolly \u2014 were very popular and\nwe hope to have them back later this\nterm. That's a 'plug'. Their songs were\nmostly humorous and at one time they\naccompanied a member of the Albion\nMorris Dancers\u2014Dolly's husband. We\nhope also that the Albion Morris Dancers will return with Mr. Gladstone's Bag. Shirley and Dolly themselves sang\ntraditional ballads for the most, these\nincluding the one which named Steeleye\nSpan during which Shirley forgot the\nwords, and a cry of \"Ashley, what are\nthe next words?\" rang around the Lower Refec. Again for those of you who\ndidn't know (such lack of knowledge is\nshameful for University Students!!?)\nShirley Collins is forming a new band\nwith Ashley Hutchins.\nAll in all, this concert was a success,\nthoroughly enjoyed by everyone present,\nif you massed out this time, keep a look\nout for posters which may very well announce the return appearance of these\nexcellent enter tai in ers. SUTHERLAND BROTHERS\nAND QUIVER\n'What's all this then?' you may have\nasked yourself if you went to last Friday's concert. 'I remember when the\nSuthererland Brothers were folk musicians, and Quiver were a nice quiet\nband.' I must confess I enjoyed them\nmore as they were, but, ours is not to\nquestion why, the amalgamation has\nnow been fully completed, though there\nis s it ill a lot of jagged edges. 1 saw them\na year ago, and their music was just as\ntight as it is now.\nThey started with a few noisy and\nquite rough rockers (did they really\nneed three guitarists and three people\nsinging? \u2014 at least it might not have\nbeen SB bad if they were harmon ising). The audience were very appreciative \u2014\nit must be something to do with the at-mo sphere. \u2014 You know, a smallish hall\njam-packed with hot sweaty bodies,\nknee deep in Newky Brown. That put\nme in a bad frame of mind to begin\nw f ch. as 1 prefer to listen to the music\nin comfort.\nThese they followed with a nice slow\none, which they called bluesy, But when\nanother 12-bar followed I began to wonder what had happened to all the good\nmusic I was sure they were capable of\nproducing.\nAs it happened they'd saved it all\nfor the latter part of the performance.\nOne of the Sutherland Brothers changed\nhis guitar for a tambourine, and the lead\nguitarist, if you see what I mean, made\nuse of his non-appearance at the beginning to retune his guitar. The result was\nmuch more melody (please excuse the\nquote) with a nice tinkling piano in\nthe background, and after some time\nTim Renswick returned to carry on for\nquite some more time as the song orientated itself around his guitar work.\nSoon came, inevitably, their two\nsingles '1 don't want to love you but\nyou got me anyway' and 'Sailing'\n(written about the trip to see one's Maker), which was necessarily changed\nfrom its original version (would you believe a piano-accordion ac com pani ment?) to give the rest of the band\nsomething to do.\nTo top this they added a very nice\ntreatment of 'Love is love and not fade\naway', though they regressed (in my\nopinion) to the noisy ones again for the\nlast few.\nG J.K. THEATRE\nJU DIES\nComedy Thcot-re,\nPanto St. SWT\nIn these days of strife, Judlies is\nan excellent way to brighten the gloom.\nThe play is not one for those who like\nto discuss the deep social comments in\nAct 2 over a late meal. I can highly\nrecommend it to those who like a laugh\nwithout stretching their minds.\nThe play stars John Alderton and his\nwife, Pauline Collins, both late of ITV's \"Upstairs, Downstairs\", and is set in\na two-girls-sharing flat somewhere north\nof Watford. Inventive stage management changes the set from the flat, to\na squash court gallery and then to a bar\nby careful use of lighting alone.\nThe play revolves around the sex life\nof two young teachers, and is rather like\na risque version of the \"Liver Birds\".\nAlderton and Collins are clearly the\nstars, but the supporting cast are let\ndown by their mediocre parts, although\nthey perform these well. The play only\nruns for about 110 minutes, but it is\ncertainly packed with humour through-out<\n\"Judies\" is one of the best comedies\nI have seen on the London stage for\nmany months. Highly recommended.\nRECORDS\nELEPHANTS\nMEMORY\nANGELS FOREVER\n\"Let's get one thing straight \u2014 Elephant's Memory are the band who\nbacked John Lennon during his initial\ndays in New York, the band that effectively became the Plastic Ono Band!\nSo says the opening lines of the publicity handout. 1 may not be the most\nknowledgeable person in the college regarding these things, but there are some\nfacts that most record reviewers know.\nMaybe having had to be thought of\nas \"John Lennon's backing band\" has\nnot helped them. No doubt their earlier\nalbums are worth having in their own\nright, but it is through JL's \"Sometime\nin New York City\" that they are really\nknown.\nOn listening to their latest offering,\n\"Angels Memory\", this seems to be\nrather a shame. They don't need J L to give them a name. Their music is\nsufficient on its own.\nElephant's Memory consist of Rick\nFrank on drums; Stan Bronstein on\nsaxophone and vocals; Gary von Seyoc.\nbass and vocals; Chris Robison, key-board, guitar and vocals; and Jonathan\nSachs, guitar and vocals, and the group\nhave done the rounds of companies before reaching Polydor (through Buddah,\nMetromedia, Apple). On the way they\nwere responsible for the music in \"Mid-night Cowboy\" (theme music excluded).\nThe record can be summed up as consisting of good, strong rock 'n roll.\nThere's no beating about the bush with\nsubtleties, niceties or fancy frills. The\ndrums are steady and combine with the,\nother percussion to give a good rhythm\nthat is impossible to not get caught up\nin. Put this record on in the presence\nof a few people who didn't know the\ngroup and they'd first think that they\nrecognise the artistes and then, forgetting that, they'd most likely be joining,\nin with the beat. A good bet for parties.\nA good rocking album which should,\nif given enough airplay and opportunity\nhelp fix Elephant's Memory on the\nscene as Elephant's Memory and not\nJL's backing band.\nYET TIES ARE COMING Across Down\n1 Clumsy (8). 1 Unbeautiful (4).\n5 Related (4). 2 Sound Science (7).\n9 Contrast (5). 3 Frozen area (7, 5).\n10' Inner Diameter (7). 4 jewellery (6).\n11 Impervious (12). 6 Be Bak (5).\n13 Horse food search (6). 7 Requirement Finishes\n(4, 4).\n14 Atoll (6).\nFire Bells (5, 7).\n14 Atoll (6).\n8 Fire Bells (5, 7).\n17 Super Spy!

Civil Rights Association, which unites the poor sections of both the Catholic and Protestant peoples,\nagainst British domination.

Policy.\nConference calls for:\n(1) A joint meeting of the General Council of both\nthe British and Irish TUC's in order to discuss how\nthe Trade Union Movement in both countries can\nunite in the campaign for a United Ireland.\n(2) The release of all internees.\n(3) The repeal of all repressive legislation.\n(4) A Bill of Rights, as demanded by the 1971 annual\nconference of the British TUC. to guarantee democratic freedoms and an end of discrimination.\n(5) The withdrawal of British troops to barracks,\npending their complete withdrawal.\n(6) A Non-sectarian police force, under democratic\ncontrol to replace the Royal Ulster Constabulary.\nConference believes that, unless these steps are taken\nforthwith, a situation where the basic problems of Ireland as a whole can be solved, cannot be created.\nConference:\n(7) Condemns the continued use of British Troops in\nNorthern Ireland as an army of occupation.\n(8) fully supports the troops out movement.\n(9) Condemns the force-feeding of the four prisoners\non hunger strike, and fully supports their demands to\nbe accorded Political Prisoner status, and to be returned to N.I. to serve their sentences.\n(10) Condemns the harassment of the prisoners and\ntheir relatives, through the refusal of the authorities to\nallow visits to the prisoners, on numerous occasions.\nInstructions.\nExec, and CO's(1) To work for maximum support\nfor organisations campaigning on all or some of these\npolicies and to work large scale involvement of students\nin these activities.\nExec, Areas, C.O.'s2) To affiliate to, take part in,\nand publicise the activities of the troops Out Movement\nand hence, to call for the with drawl of troops from Northern Ireland.\nExec, Areas C.O.'s3) to public i ly condemn the force\nfeeding of any prisoner, and to campaign for the\ngranting of Political Prisoner status for the four, as\nwell as for the return to Ireland of all Irish Political\nprisoners that wish to serve their sentences there.\nExec. (4) To publicise the fact that three of the\nnine are N.U.S. members, and to publicise the campaign\nin the national press.\nStudent Finance\nA.1, Conference believes\nthat the recent cutbacks in\neducation spending are\npart of the government's policy to maintain profits\nat the expense of the working class and other strata\nsuch as students.\n2. Conference considers that if our demands are\nnot mat there must be an\nimmediate militant response by students. Students must show the government that they are not\nprepared to sacrifice their\nown interests to those of\na rich minority.\n3. Conference considers that the grants campaign must continue\nthroughout the summer\nand autumn terms.\n4. Militant action in\nsupport of the grants cam-pa ign.6. Unions should be\nencouraged to hold rent\nstrikes as a tactic in the\ngrants campaign. But it is\nup to each union to make\nits own decision. This is\nwhat is actually the case\nat the moment and to\ntalk of a national rent\nstrike is quite clearly ludicrous.7. Conference welcomes and supports the\ncall for a General Election\nHowever, Conference recognises that in the event\nof a Labour victory, the\nnecessity for the mass action of students and workers remains in order to\ncompel that government to\ncarry out policies that begin to challenge the power\nof big business. Therefore\nunder a Labour Government the need for militant\nmass action by students in\nsupport of the EC. re-mains.\nConference Notes: 1) In\nview of the Government's plans for placing the burden of solving its economic crisis onto the Working\nclass, and other strata,\nsuch as students, the third\nreport from the Expenditure Committee (Educa-tion & Arts Sub-Committee) for the season 1973-74 on Postgraduate Education comes at an extremely opportune time\nfor the Government.\n2) That in view of the\ncrisis, the report lis likely\nto gain wide support from\nM.P.'s.3) The proposals in\nthe report for supplementary loans for British Postgraduates.\n4) The proposals that\ngraduates spend a period\nof years in industry before\nstarting postgraduate\nstudies, and that those\nstudies be more related to\nthe needs of industry.\n5) The proposal to cut\nback postgraduate numbers from 19% to 17% of\nstudent numbers, that\ngiven the proposed cut\nbacks in total student\nnumbers, this would mean\na substantially larger drop\nin postgraduates.\n6) The proposal that\nOverseas students fees be\nraised from \u00a3250 p.a to\n\u00a31,500 p.a., thus making\nstudy in this country virtually impossible except\nfor those on large sponsor-ships.\n7) The fact that overseas students form 25%\nof the postgraduates in\nthis country.\nPolicy.\nConference welcomes\nthe fact that:\n1) NUS Exec. has\npublicly eon de med the re-port.\nConference believes that:\n2) CO's should initiate a campaign to show\nthe membership's total opposition to a) Cutbacks\nin postgraduate numbers,\nb) the loan financing of\npostgraduate education.\nC. The ty i ing of Postgraduate Education to the\nwhims of Capitalist Industry.\n3) NUS expresses its\nopposition to any increase\nin fees for overseas stu-dents, and launches a campaign, aimed at gaining full grants for all\nOverseas students.

General\n(1) Conference notes the increasing discrimination against\nBlack people in Britain through direct and indirect deprivation in the following areas:\n(a) Housing, (b) Educational opportunity, (c) Police har-as s ment,(3) anti-immigrant legislation, eg, the recent\nCourt of Appeal decision to apply the 1972 Immigration\nAct retrospectively.\n(2) Conference recognises the implications of the present\ncrisis and the intentions of the government to impose an\nera of austerity and the prospect of an accompanying period of recession. Conference believes that the Government is\nagain likely to use minorities as scapegoats for shortages\nof accommodation, employment, etc., and take the opportunity to attack them via more stringent legislation and deprivation as above.\n(3) Conference believes that students have a major role\nto play in stepping up the fight against racial is m and fascist\norganisations.\n(4) Conference recognises that the sources of racism today\ncannot toe separated from Britain's colonialist past; that\nracism is in the natural product of imperialism since the\nEuropean states m ported workers from the newly independent States of Africa, Asia and Ithe West Indies and employed\nthem in the hardest and worst paid jobs.\n(5) Conference recognises Ithat racial is m is a tactic used\nto divide the working-class 'by providing a scapegoat for diverting the dissatisfaction Of ordinary people from the s ys tem, on to an under-privileged and easily identifiable section\nof the community.\n(6) Conference recognises that the fight against racism\nwithin Britain cannot be divorced from the fight against\nracism and apartheid in Southern Africa.\nB. Immigration.\n1) Conference notes the increasing isolation of and\nmountings attacks upon migrant workers in .Europe, eg. in\nMarseilles.\n(2) Conference notes:\n(a) The decision of the House of Lords of June 1973 making\nthe 1971 immigration Act \"retrospective\".\n(Jb) The refusal of the CPSA to obey the instructions of\nSir Keith Joseph, to demand to see the passports of blacks\nand ask for insurance cards.\n(c) The attempts of immigrant workers' trade unionists,\nand other organisations to oppose the House of Lords judge-ment.\n(3) Conference utterly rejects the view that racist attitudes stem from the presence of black people i in this country.\nC. The Government.\n(1) Conference recognises that government, both Conservative and Labour, have sought to isolate blacks through\nracist ideology, by discriminating legislation of the immigration Act and the retrospective clauses.\n(2) Conference believes that the machinery of Race Relations remains ineffective in the face of racist ideology perpetrated through education and the mass media.\n(3) Conference believes that this is a consequence of the\nbureaucratic nature of the Race 'Relations machinery, which\nis totally separated from the community. Conference recognises that this only serves to alienate blacks and discourage\nthem from using the various organisations, particularly in\nview of suspicions of racism inside the Race Relations\nindustry (eg Lyttle case).\n(4) Conference condemns the Government's refusal to take\nvigorous action against racist activity and propaganda and\nits failure to investigate satisfactorily the complaints by\nBlack People against the Police.\nD. Organised Racism.\n(1) Conference notes the disturbing increases in racist\nattitudes, from which no group, including students, is\nentirely free. Conference notes thai, the activity of ta sci st or-gan is at ions, notably the National Front, has increased re-cent ly, appealing with racist propaganda and inciting v.o en ce, against black people. Conference views with alarm the increasing electoral support for the National Front.\n(2) Conference calls for an extensive and intensive opposition to ras lsm and fascist organisations in conjunction with\nanti-racist and progressive forces; and calls on CO s not to\nprovide platforms or any assistance to ras iet and fascist\norganisations.\n(3) Conference recognises that racists have found a new\nweapon in the theories of inequality between races propagated by Jensen, Eysenck, Shockley, etc. (ad nausea m). Conference rejects this spurious and unscientific \"research\" and\nreaffirms its belief in the quality of all peoples.\nE. Education\n(1) Conference recognises that, while not providing a panacea, the education system can play a major role in reshaping attitudes and preparing children to cope with a multiracial society; but to do this must become much more\nprogressive.\n(2). Conference welcomes the decision of the DE.S to stop\nthe \"numbers game\", i.e. keeping misleading statistics on\n\"immigrant children\".\n(3) Conference condemns the racist argument that blacks\nmust be \"educated\" to \"fit in\", i.e. abandon their own cul-ture s.(4) Conference believes that the idea of racial minorities\nbeing forced to adopt the culture of white society is racist\nsince it denies cultural identity.\n(5) Conference condemns the racial is m existing in the\neducation system, reflected in t ne nature of the test too oka and syllabi.\n(6) Conference notes that a large proportion of children\nin FS N schools are black; this represents a cop-out on the\npart of the system in not coming to grips with the special\nproblems of black children.\n(7) Conference believes that criticism of the education\nsystem is essential for failing\n(a) to reflect <the history, culture and achievements o if people from the 3rd World.\n(to) to provide the training for teachers and social workers necessary to deal with the problems of immigrant child-ren.\nF. Overseas Students.\n(1) Conference recognises that a section of our member-ship, i.e. overseas students, suffer particularly through racism\nand the actions of racist and fascist organisations.\n(2) Conference notes the firm stand taken by N.U.S. and\nStudent Unions against racial is m, in particular the actions\nagainst the increase in students' fees in 1967.\n(3) Conference notes the recommendation of the Commons\nExpenditure committee, that overseas post-graduates should\npay the full fees (for their tuition (\u00a31,500). This pr oh.iO it ive cost would prevent overseas i post grads( some 30 per cent\nof all pg's) from studying in 'Britain. Conference opposes\nthis recommendation as discriminatory, and reiterates its\nopposition to discriminatory fees.\n(4) Conference notes that there is often active discrimination against overseas students in the field of ac com moda tion.\nG. Activity.\n(1) Conference welcomes the development of mass and\nfor community-based organisations amongst black people\nwhich\n(a) serves to counter the increased discrimination and police\nharassment\n(to) and try to develop a stronger, self-respecting community which can undertake its own defence.\n(2) Conference notes the survival of the three centres for\nhomeless black youth and recognises this as a significant\ndevelopment.\n(3) Conference believes that NUS should Work with such\ngroups, for the urgent need is to be build the unity of all\nanti-racist forces.\nInstructions\nExec. 1.
