The start of\nthe season may have been a little slow\nbut within a couple of games we were\nin full swing and scoring the goals\n(on and off the pitch) when it really\nmattered.\nOur superiority over the medics in\nall aspects of the sport will become\nevident within mere minutes and the\nunevenly matched teams will make\nfor an entertaining game for all the\nIC supporters. The defensive line will\nshow absolutely no mercy in their\nquest to keep the medics without any\ngoals and our forwards will continue\nto repeatedly penetrate the D. As we\ndo every Wednesday at sports night.\nThe fresher\u2019s are especially good at\nit having learned from some of the\nolder more experienced players.\nSquad:\nAash Shankar\nAlice Tidswell\nBecky Rickman\nBryony Connor\nChantal Fifield\nCharlotte Baumhauer\nCharlotte Ekins\nClaudia Jackaman-White\nEmma Flynn\nGeorgie Wearing\nHarriet Stevenson\nHayley Thompson (C)\nNora Clarke\nThis season we have really settled\ninto our recently promoted, tough\nBUCS league, no longer being\nthe newbies but presenting real\ncompetition for the other teams.\nWe have learnt how to deal with\npressure and have had some fantastic\nresults against the tougher teams in\nour league. Unfortunately, we have\nbeen extremely injury-prone this\nseason with many matches ending up\na player or two down.\nHowever, we have not let that\naffect our drive to win each match\nand our team morale is as high as\never! We continue to train with an\ninternational coach who, as well as\nfocusing on the basics, has taught us\na new trick or two to help at those\ncrucial moments during Varsity.\nWith both teams doing well in\ntheir respective leagues this match\npromises to be one to watch!\nSquad:\nJessica Mistry\nRosemary Belcher\nSharon Ocansey\nRachel Clingan\nRebecca Ayres\nNatalie Condie (C)\nAnna Hurley\nCatriona Stoddart\nSally White\nEsme Bennett\nCharlotte Read\nClaudia Fowler-Williams (VC)\nHannah Wilson\nFelicia Bamgbose\nThe team have had a cracking\nseason this year, with 4 newbies\njoining the team! We\u2019ve had some\ngreat success in BUCS, a highlight\nbeing our 27-0 win! Unluckily we\nnarrowly missed out on promotion,\ncoming joint top of the league\nand losing out on goal difference.\nHowever, this has just made us more\ndetermined to prove ourselves at\nVarsity and put our new shooting\nskills into practice!\nSquad:\nZoe Leftley\nKrishna Shah\nAlice West\nTirion Swart\nLaura Kennedy\nLisa Bradwell\nFiona Field\nKarol Basta\nNatalia Sanchez-Thomas\nLauren Fowler\nRachel Hulatt\nAlice Brown\nMargot Pikovsky\nHelen Fielden\nIt\u2019s been a tough season for the\n1s, after being promoted last year.\nWe\u2019ve had injuries to crucial players\nthroughout the year which has led to\ninconsistent performances.\nA mid table LUSL position and a\nlower BUCS standing don\u2019t do our\nquality justice and when we\u2019ve turned\nup we\u2019ve shown we can turn it on \u2013 as\nIC know well. We\u2019ve done the double\nover them in BUCS with 4-1 & 6-5\nvictories which means they\u2019re yet to\nshow they can beat us. With 26 goals\nshared between the teams over 3\nfixtures this season (including a 5-5\ndraw in LUSL), Varsity promises to be\na thriller \u2013 bring it on!\nSquad:\nDexter Tarr (GK)\nTim Woodhead\nAlex Freethy\nMatt Baker\nJosh Orpen-Palmer\nCharlie Rookes\nJonny Baker\nOscar Newman\nJonny Zheng\nMrigank Sinha (C)\nDavid Kockerling\nJosh Enson\nEd Norman\nThe Imperial Medics Hockey 2nd\nXI have had an impressive season\nso far. In BUCS we narrowly missed\nout on a chance for promotion\nbut remain in good stead to finish\ncomfortably in second place.\nWe\u2019ve only come up against IC\nonce this year, and after a very\nclosely fought game, they came out\nas dubious 1-0 winners. Having gone\nfrom strength to strength since then,\nwe are confident that this time the\nfinal result will be different. With a\nmix of players from all years at the\nmed school, from freshers to final\nyears, we have got a tightly knit squad\nwho are willing to fight and work\nhard for each other and are raring\nto go in what will undoubtedly be an\nexciting and sharply contested match.\nSquad:\nArun Patel\nMichael Smith\nJack Cope\nMatteo Di Carlofelice\nHugo Brundle\nMatt Baldry (C)\nAli Yousaf\nTom Jennings\nKieran Chen\nAli Ijaz\nPeter Davis\nAnkur Gupta\nAnesh Patel\nThe 2014/2015 season has been\na great one for the IC Men\u2019s 3s. We\nstarted off slowly with an opening\nloss to LSE but since then we have\ngone from strength to strength and\nwe currently sit in pole position in\nboth our BUCS and LUSL leagues\nwith an aggregate goal difference\nof +34 which is a big contrast to\nthe -47 goal difference our medic\ncounterparts have managed to\nachieve.\nOur results give us an optimistic\nattitude for Varsity and historically\nwe have come out on top; last year\nfinished 2 \u2013 1 to IC due to great\nfinishing by Jamie Couchman.\nHowever, the Medic 3s always bring\ntheir best to Varsity and they are\ntechnically in the BUCS league above\nus (no doubt due to their large Squad\nthat seems to extend to their Men\u2019s\n1s) so we will need to be ruthless in\nour play and I have no doubt that if\nwe play as we have this past season\nand they play like they have, we will\ncome out on top.\nSquad:\nIan Baldwin (GK)\nWill Pannetier\nJohn Ballentine\nMax Naylor-Marlow\nPriyav Shah\nNaveeth Basheer\nThomas Papworth-Smith\nCallum Fiske\nGeorge Brooks\nJaimin Patel\nRory Ainslee\nGuy Khosla\nAdrian Baily (C)\nJamie Couchman\nJasper Stassen\nAdam Liddell\nWith an array of club injuries and\nuncontrollable external factors, this\nyears 3rd XI has been completely\nturned up side down. With a difficult\nseason in a tough BUCS league, the\nresults have not gone our way.\nHowever we have developed\nimmensely as a squad and hence\nhad some brilliant performances\nin our LUSL league and in the\ninaugural United Hospitals Reserves\nTournament.\nWith newfound confidence, the\nteam are sure we can put last year\u2019s\nnarrow loss behind us, and return to\ntake the win we deserve.\nSquad:\nPrerak Dwivedi\nPaul Halford\nNikhil Math\nJoshua Lucas (C)\nMichel Abou-Abdallah\nShan Mian\nGajendra Sarveswaran\nBreanainn Roberson\nGurtej Dhillon\nPeter Thom\nZain Rizvi\nKushan Sen\nMohamed Sheikh\nThe men\u2019s squash team has had\na fantastic season, winning LUSL\nunbeaten and losing only one\nmatch in BUCS to win the league\ncomfortably. We also had a good\ncup run, reaching the last 16 in both\nLUSL and BUCS cups and then losing\nto strong 1st Teams from King\u2019s\nand Kent respectively. New boys\nTom Readshaw and David Anderle\nhave been exceptionally consistent\nall season and strong inputs from\nSanjay Bhattacharya, Kharthik\nChakravarthy, Raf Pesquidous and\nMoaz Hamid have ensured that we\nhave been the team to beat in our\nleagues.\nSquad:\nTom Readshaw\nDavid Anderle\nNick Dunn (C)\nRaf Pesquidous\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nIt\u2019s been a fantastic year for the\nMedics Squash teams. A wave of\nnew talent has swept into the club\nfreshening and strengthening the\nWomen\u2019s team, and the Men\u2019s 1st and\n2nd teams. Captain Dom Marshall\nhas lead the Men\u2019s first team to a 4th\nplace finish, winning five of eight\ngames in LUSL division one.\nThis is an encouraging\nimprovement from last season\u2019s one\nwin. In a similar fashion, Captain\nTom Li has lead the second team to\nthree wins from eight games, a three\nwin improvement on last year\u2019s\ncampaign, with one match still to\nplay. Men\u2019s squash has never been\nstronger and we move onwards with a\nfresh optimism.\nThe Women\u2019s team has also made\nimpressive strides since last year.\nUnder the leadership of Captain\nAnna Humphreys, the women\u2019s team\nachieved a record number of wins,\ngiving them a solid mid-table finish.\nMen\u2019s squad:\nSamuel Tindall\nDominic Marshall\nMoaz Hamid\nSimon Thackray\nThomas Butters\nHaaris Rahim\nVinay Shah\nSam Ensor\nJosh Milewczyk\nMark Sykes\nWomen\u2019s Squad:\nAnna Humphreys\nHermi Glyn\nJen Lewsey\nJade Man\nAira Syairah\nWe\u2019ve had an amazing season so\nfar with massive development in our\ngame and loads of wins, including\na 3 match-winning streak! It\u2019s been\ngreat fun playing with the team and\nwatching so much improvement,\nparticularly with players new to\nthe game. Seeing our team grow\nstronger and become closer has been a\nfantastic experience. I look forward to\nleading the team into what should be\nthe closest female basketball varsity\nfor years!\nSquad:\nMary-Rose Ballard (C)\nIvy Shum\nGeorgie Lobo-Horth\nMiriam Zegeye\nRumessa Raja\nShannon Brown\nMollie Gupta\nXin Zhang\nZhen Cahilog\nThis season has been a successful\none for the mens\u2019 1st team as we are\ncurrently projected to finish 2nd\nin the league. We lost half the 1st\nteam at the end of last year so it was\ngreat to see such a high standard of\nbadminton during trials.\nCurrently the team consists of 3\nmedics and 3 non-medics (including\na PHD student), making it quite a\ndiverse team. On the badminton\ncourt we were knocked out of the cup\nby the men from the LSE 2nd team in\nthe first round, however it was a close\nmatch and the result was only decided\non total point score.\nIn the league we\u2019ve had our fair\nshare of wins, but with one too many\ndraws it seems unlikely we\u2019ll be\ngetting promoted back to the league\nfrom which we got relegated from last\nyear. The most memorable part of the\nyear has to be the games played on the\ntrains to those far away games.\nDavid Zhang thinks Caspar is a\nfemale ghost and (still) owes the whole\nfirst team a pint. I have thoroughly\nenjoyed captaining this team and I\nwish my successor all the best.\nSquad:\nRishi Agrawal (C)\nAlex Owens\nLouis Fox\nMikkel Kranker\nRui Wei\nZarius Ferozepurwalla\nThis season, IC lacrosse is ready to\nrepeat last year\u2019s feat of thrashing\nthe medics. With this year being\none of the best years for Women\u2019s,\nMen\u2019s and Mixed lacrosse, there\u2019s no\ndoubt about it: IC players make all the\ndifference. Diet plans and training\nschedules in preparation for Varsity\nhave begun.\nHow will the medics be able to\nhandle Sophie \u201cThe Bolt\u201d Bolton,\nAhranee \u201cGoal Denied\u201d Canden,\nLukas \u201cLegs It\u201d Krauss?

Strong, independent,\ndominant women come in all forms,\nappear in all sorts of genres, and are\na welcome addition to the world of\nsmall-screen entertainment, as they\nall battle for success in their fields.\nThey have all been with us for several\nyears now (with the exception of one\nfreshman series in discussion here),\nand how they have developed over\nthe course of the shows has been a\nfascinating journey. Welcome back\nladies, and long may you rule the\nworld of primetime television.\nCarrying the beacon of light for\nthe sixth year now is lawyer Alicia\nFlorrick of The Good Wife, played by\nthe tough-as-nails, Emmy-winning,\nJulianna Margulies. No longer\ndeterred nor defined by her husband\u2019s\nshocking political sex scandal that\nturned her life upside down in the\npilot episode, Alicia has gone from\na junior associate of a law firm close\nto getting fired, to become a named\npartner at her very own successful\nfirm. Her ambition does not stop\nthere: she has also recently found\nthe calling to run for the State\u2019s\nAttorney\u2019s office, a political race\nthat throws new challenges her way\n\u2013 all of them morally ambiguous\nand ethically dubious. Yet she\nremains steadfast in her belief and\ndetermination that she will actually\ndo a good job, and as someone who\nhas stuck by her for all these years, it\nis not difficult to absolutely believe\neverything she says. She is at the most\ncomplicated, busiest time of her life,\nhaving to handhold top clients of\nher firm, trying to focus on winning\nthe race with countless interviews,\ntrick questions and mind games from\nthe opponents, whilst also having to\ndeal with her personal life. Season\n5 saw the shocking exit of a beloved\ncharacter who was destined to become\nthe lasting love interest for Alicia,\nbut now with Will Gardner (Josh\nCharles) gone, Alicia not only has\ngrief, but now feels more comfortable\nto explore possible options. Two\ngood-looking candidates come to\nmind, her campaign manager Johnny\nElfman (Steven Pasquale), and fellow\nlawyer Finn Polmar (Matthew\nGoode). Yes, she is still married to her\ninfluential husband, Peter, who is\nnow the Governor of Illinois. But she\nis smart enough to know that this is a\nmarriage of convenience, one that is\nused to further each other\u2019s political\naspirations. And why the hell should\nshe not use this to her advantage? Her\nhusband has made and continues to\nmake one too many mistakes and she\nhas had it. All we can say is, to quote\nChelsea Handler in This Means War,\n\u201cget out there, you get flexible!\u201d. Her\ncharacter is veering further away\nfrom the old-fashioned, traditional\nsense of what the terminology \u201cthe\ngood wife\u201d may evoke, and it is about\ndamn time that she takes full control\nof her own life.\nDespite the many fluctuations\nin the overall quality of the show,\nmedical drama Grey\u2019s Anatomy is still\ngoing strong in its eleventh season,\nposting more than decent ratings in\nthe important 18-49 demographic.\nThere was a worry that with the\ndeparture of the irreplaceable\nCristina Yang (Sandra Oh), the\nshow would never be the same. The\nseries has since tried to introduce\nsomeone else of dependant comfort\nand reliance to Meredith Grey (Ellen\nPompeo) in the form of her half-sister\nDr Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary),\nand to be frank, this has not quite\nworked out in terms of finding a\nsuitable replacement. But the most\ninteresting sub-plot of late has not\nincluded Meredith, not one bit.\nFocusing on Meredith only brings up\ntedious marital troubles between her\nand her husband, neurosurgeon Dr\nDerek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey),\ngiven how the writers of Grey\u2019s\nAnatomy cannot leave any one happy\ncouple alone. But Patrick Dempsey\nhas been given a few episodes off\nand the latest episodes have been all\nabout Derek\u2019s younger sister, Amelia\nShepherd (Caterina Scorsone) who\nis also a neurosurgeon, struggling\nto live up to the high expectations\nalready set by her world-renowned\nolder brother. Amelia is smart, and\nthinks at a speed at which most\npeople struggle to keep up. Her\nbiggest challenge is taking on a brain\ntumour of a fellow doctor in the\nhospital, neonatal surgeon Dr Nicole\nHerman (Geena Davis). Dr Herman,\nlearning of her terminal diagnosis,\ntakes Dr Arizona Robbins (Jessica\nCapshaw) under her wings and starts\nto impart all the latest, cutting-edge\nresearch, skills, and knowledge;\npassing on the torch so to speak.\nThe dynamic between these three\nunique, fascinating characters played\nby outstanding actresses has been a\nreal driving force behind what has\nmade Grey\u2019s Anatomy so gripping and\nirresistible as of late, a much-needed\nchange of tone for the long-running\ndrama. There is much uncertainty\nsurrounding this tumour: Amelia\u2019s\nplan may not work, Nicole\u2019s time is\nrunning out, she is having to deal\nwith the worsening symptoms that\nare slowly but surely creeping up on\nher, and Arizona needs to keep it\ntogether to learn from the best, but\nalso to watch a friend possibly die in\nthe process.\nThe show effectively builds up\nthe drama to its climax episode of\nthe date of the actual brain surgery.\nAmelia, troubled by insecurities and\ndoubts, at one point demands that\nsomeone call her brother for help,\nwho is all the way out in the East\nCoast in Washington D.C. (the show\nis set in Seattle, the West Coast). Will\nshe be able to make it through what\nis scheduled to be a 15-hour surgery?\nCan Dr Herman survive such a\npunishing procedure? There is a sense\nthat the show dramatises its medical\nscenes far too much: an unconvincing\nact of what can be seen as last-minute\nheroism in the surgery is really\npushing it: but ultimately, it makes\ngreat television.\nAnother smash-hit in terms of\nratings is audience-favourite, Scandal,\nperhaps the most blatantly feminism-pushing show on air right now.\nWhat with Mellie (Bellamy Young)\nlamenting over the fair point of how\nthe job of picking out the White\nHouse china pattern would be a paid\nposition if a man had to do it, and\nwith protagonist Olivia Pope (Kerry\nWashington) telling off the President\nof the United States/her on-off\nboyfriend Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) for\nusing the word \u201cbitch\u201d to describe a\nhard-working, opinionated female\nstaff member in the White House,\nthis fast-paced political thriller\nhas room to stand up for its female\ncharacters in the midst of creating the\nmost outrageous plot lines. The more\nridiculous the show gets, the better.\nIt is a show centring on larger-than-life characters thrown in impossible\nsituations. Despite its male characters\nbeing in various positions of power,\nthe show is at its most fun when the\nfemale characters get into the action.\nOlivia Pope fixes problems like\nno other, and has been for the past\nfour years. Rigging elections, helping\nout victims of sexual harassment,\nuncovering plots, working on political\ncampaigns, and also finding time for\nromance, her talent knows no bounds.\nHer longest love interest Fitzgerald\nGrant is the most frustrating, mopey,\nsappy character ever to grace the\nsmall screen, and the other man, Jake\n\"Welcome\nback ladies,\nand long\nmay you\nrule the\nworld of\nprimetime\ntelevision.\"\n\"To quote\nChelsea\nHandler in\nThis Means\nWar, \u201cget\nout there,\nyou get\nflexible!.\"\nJulianna Margulies kicks butt as Alicia Florrick in\nThe Good Wife\nDrs Amelia Shepherd, Arizona Robbins (top left + right), and Nicole\nHerman (bottom) are surgeons who never give up in Grey\u2019s Anatomy\nBallard (Scott Foley) fares no better in\nhis whiny portrayal of jealousy. But\nwith Fitz, we get the invaluable Mellie\nGrant, his wife, pitching up playing\nbigger and bigger roles, injecting\nsome fiery passion into the show. She\nis willing to do just about anything\nfor what she considers is right, and\nas she exudes vibrant confidence\nwalking up and down the corridors\nof The White House, it is no wonder\nshe has become such a valuable player\nin the show. She has big plans for her\npolitical future, and we cannot wait\nto see how big of a role she will be\ngiven in the future. Her screen time\nis increasing by the minute, and the\nexcellent Bellamy Young who rapid-fires her lines of dialogue throwing in\nall sorts of emotions into her delivery\nis a joy to watch. Another stand-out\nfemale presence only appearing\nin a guest appearance capacity is\nKhandi Alexander, playing Maya\nPope, Olivia\u2019s duplicitous, terrorist,\nmurderous mother. Evil maternal\nfigures often end up being the most\ninteresting, keeping us all guessing\nuntil the very end as to where their\nloyalties truly lie. Khandi Alexander\nhas tons of fun with her role, one\nthat was offered to her without an\naudition, and she fits perfectly into\nthe crazy narrative of the show\neffortlessly.\nSeason 4 of Once Upon a Time\nkicked things off by immediately\ncashing in on the success of Disney\u2019s\nFrozen, by introducing Elsa (Georgina\nHaig), perhaps the most independent,\nfeminist Disney princess ever, into\nthe weird and wonderful town of\n\"Scandal\n[is] perhaps\nthe most\nblatantly\nfeminism-pushing\nshow on air\nright now.\"\nStorybrooke. This move paid off,\nseeing the season 4 premiere peak in\nits ratings. The ice-controlling queen\nis dead-set on her quest to find her\nsister Anna (Elizabeth Lail), and later,\nthe main villain of the first half of\nthe season, the powerful Snow Queen\n(Elizabeth Mitchell) appears for a\nmagical showdown. ABC\u2019s fantasy-adventure show has the advantage of\nhaving an abundance of characters\nto work with, and when it introduced\nelements of Frozen it was off to a good\nstart. But with the show\u2019s budget\nbeing what it is, it never makes full\nuse of its powerful characters. The\naction sequences always, always fall\nshort, but making up for its childish,\nalmost embarrassing scenes of what\nis supposed to be excitement, is\nthe often very smart background\n\"Yes, the\nQueens of\nDarkness\nhave\narrived,\nand they\nare of\ncourse\nup to no\ngood.\"\nOlivia Pope (top), Mellie Grant (bottom left), and Maya Pope (bottom\nright) keep things fiery in Scandal\nstories of new characters that are\nincorporated into existing ones. Plus,\nif you feel as though a certain story\narc is running out of steam, the show\ndoes the smart thing of splitting its\nseasons into two halves essentially,\nwrapping up the first half\u2019s plot lines,\nand teasing new ones for the coming\nmonths. So as of this moment, the\nFrozen storyline has finished, and the\nshow is getting ready to turn into a\nwhole new direction.\nYes, the Queens of Darkness have\narrived, and they are of course up\nto no good. The three most iconic\nfemale villains of Disney Classics,\nMaleficent (Kristin Bauer van\nStraten), Ursula (Merrin Dungey)\nand Cruella De Vil (Victoria Smurfit),\nare teaming up, and with this lineup\nthe show should have plenty of fun\nwith them. They have done wonders\nbringing the animated characters to\ntheir live-action form. Maleficent\nis fully equipped with her staff and\nblack outfit with horns, Cruella has\nthe unforgettable black-and-white\nhair with her humongous fur coat,\nand even Ursula, who the costume\ndesigners have taken the most\ncreative liberty with, looks like the\nOcean Queen that she is, complete\nwith CGI tentacles. This is a welcome\nreturn for Maleficent, who was killed\nin an earlier season, and first-time\nappearances for Ursula and Cruella,\nwho, so far, are making this trio\nwork. Given the track record of this\nshow, perhaps it would be unwise to\nexpect a full-blown battle of sorts\nbetween good and evil, but there\nis a dark past and secret hinted at\nbetween the three evil queens, and\nthe technically \u201cgood\u201d residents of\nStorybrooke. Mary Margaret/Snow\nWhite (Ginnifer Goodwin) and\nDavid/Prince Charming (Josh Dallas)\nin particular are troubled by the\narrival of these impeccably dressed\nand spoken, scheming women. Just\nhow were the villains entangled in the\nlives of the heroes in the past? Only\ntime will tell.\nSpeaking of scheming women, the\nshow Revenge has certainly jumped\nthe shark big time but the women of\nthe series are no closer to giving their\nquest for vengeance a rest. Emily\nThorne (Emily VanCamp) has had\nit in to ruin the Grayson family for\na long time, mainly feuding with\nVictoria Grayson (Madeleine Stowe),\nwho destroyed her father, David\nClarke (James Tupper). There have\nbeen many successful takedowns\nas Emily\u2019s never-ending resources,\nalong with her martial arts skills and\ngeneral all-rounded ninja abilities\nhave served her well in chipping away\nat the Grayson family fortune and\nreputation. Ever since the absolute\nworst twist in the world that took\nplace at the end of the show\u2019s third\nseason, in which David Clarke who\nwas supposed to be dead actually\nturned out to be alive, the show has\nnever been the same, forcing silly\nplots and throwaway characters to\nclunkily push along with filling out\nThe Queens of Darkness have arrived: (from left to right) Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and Ursula get ready to\ngive fairytale villains a bad name in the second half of Once Upon a Time\u2019s fourth season\nThe Snow Queen had a brief but great stint in the first\nhalf of Once Upon a Time\u2019s fourth season\n\n"

The passing of\na student is always difficult to deal\nwith, and if you are affected by our\ncoverage, please do consult our\nwelfare pages for a list of helplines\nand contacts that are more than\nhappy to talk to you and provide any\nhelp that you need.\nIn happier news, the elections\nare finally at an end. As someone\nwho has run in not one, but two Big\nElections as a sabbatical candidate, I\ncan tell you honestly it is completely\nexhausting to run around campus,\nthrowing sweets in the faces of\nstudents you don\u2019t know and\npretending to be so cheerful and\nhappy for two whole weeks.\nAs much as I love Felix, being editor\nand campaigning to become editor\nare two very different things, and\nrequire different levels of strength\nand determination. Those two weeks\nI spent harassing students to vote for\nan exit poll for the first time ever\nthis year, to find out who you are\nvoting for and why. Although the\nturnout for the poll isn\u2019t as high as\nother surveys we run (*cough* our sex\nsurvey, which is still open by the way\n*cough*) it was filled in by enough\npeople to get a bit of a feel for how\nresults may turn out tonight for the\nsabbatical positions.\nLast year, a poll ran by The Tab\nfor the role of Union President\nwas actually incredibly close to the\nreal-life outcome, so who knows?\nSaying that, we do have less contested\npositions then last year, so many\nof the predictions aren\u2019t really\nsurprising considering it is either a\nfairly competent candidate running\nagainst RON.\nAnyway, by the time you are\nreading this, campaigning and voting\nwould have closed and the decision\nwill already be out of your hands.\nLook out for the results tonight on\nour twitter feed and the Union twitter\nfeed, or come along to the party in\nMetric later on tonight if you fancy\nwatching everything unfold for\nyourself.\nTHIS WEEK\u2019S EDITORIAL\nEDITORIAL TEAM\nCOPY EDIT TEAM\nFelix, Offices\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB\nEmail: felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTel: 020 7594 8072\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nPrinted by Iliffee Print Cambridge, Winship\nRoad, Cambridge.\nRegistered newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix\nFront page picture: Philippa Skett\nThere is still time to get\ninvolved!\nEmail felix @imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Now there is a new\nplayer out for revenge, Margaux\nLeMarchal (Karine Vanasse), who\nwants to expose Emily\u2019s lies and\ncriminal activities for reasons of her\nown. Another sudden new arrival is\nNatalie Waters (Gina Torres), who\nis competing with Victoria to be the\nQueen Bee of the rich women of the\nHamptons. Get ready to sit through\nsome intense battle of bitchy words,\nas one comeback after another\nattempts to silence the opponent. And\nto be honest, there is definitely more\ngoing on, but things have gotten so\nsilly now it is no wonder that viewers\nare turning away from the show. Still,\nthere is no denying that no other\nshow on television has a group of\nwomen of mind-boggling intentions,\ntrying to outdo one another, getting\ntheir claws out and sharpened for\ntheir ultimate goals. Seeing what\nstunning things these rich women\nwear and how they plot behind each\nother\u2019s backs to get ahead in the\nworld, Revenge has certainly come\na long way since its days of Emily\u2019s\nfocused mission.\nMoving away from the affluent\nEast Coast to the more financially\nstrapped country music industry of\nNashville, Tennessee, Rayna James\n(Connie Britton) has finally launched\nher very own record label, Highway\n65. It has been a long time coming for\nthe Queen of Country Music in the\nthird season of Callie Khouri\u2019s show,\nNashville, and for her to set this up has\nbeen no easy task. The show initially\nstarted off as a prolonged catfight\nset in the backdrop of the country\nmusic industry, with the reigning\nqueen Rayna threatened by an up-and-coming new star, Juliette Barnes\n(Hayden Panettiere). But the show\nwisely moved away from this, giving\neach singer room to breathe and\nfind their own plausible storylines,\nand the two interacting only when\nnecessary, not constantly at odds with\neach other. As of now, the two are\nhappily working together, something\nthat would have been unimaginable\nin the first season. With these two\nsingers of a massive celebrity status,\nthe show has explored the price of\nfame on personal relationships, the\nstrain it puts on families, and how\nperhaps, not everything is as it seems\non cameras and newspapers. It is\nespecially difficult for a female to be\nunder such intense media scrutiny,\nparticularly at a time of an immense\nemotional struggle, and Nashville has\nbeen consistently bold and honest\nin showing the many downsides of\nglittering careers and the flashing\nlights of fame.\nThis was particuarly well-handled\nwith the naive young talented singer/\nsongwriter Scarlett O\u2019Connor (Clare\nBowen) who has also been through\nquite the rollercoaster ride. She tried\nher hand at becoming a singing\nsensation herself, but the pressure\nwas too much, and sometimes it just is\nnot meant to be for some people. But\nshe has found her calling elsewhere,\nEmily Thorne and Victoria Grayson of Revenge are still going at it trying to ruin each\nother\u2019s lives for whatever reason that you have stopped caring about\nfocusing on writing, and playing in\nsmaller gigs with people she trusts,\na sweet and poignant dynamic she\nhas struck up with two of her ex-boyfriends: an unlikely trio for sure,\nbut one that clearly works.\nThe newest recurring cast member\nto be added to the show brings with\nher a serious, weighty subject matter.\nSadie Stone\u2019s (Laura Benanti) career\nas a country singer is on the rise,\nbut things get complicated when\nher abusive ex-husband shows up\nout of the blue demanding a slice of\nher earnings, even serving her with\na subpoena. Benanti\u2019s trembling,\nfrightened portrayal of a battered\nwoman is often heart-breaking,\nbut she eventually makes a stand\nto fight for what is rightfully hers,\nbravely speaking out against her\nmanipulative ex. Rayna is right\nthere in Sadie\u2019s corner, and the pair\nof them refusing to be bullied into\nsubmission is a well-structured,\nimportant message for women and\nmen everywhere.\nAlready renewed for a well-deserved\nsecond season is the most impressive\nnetwork primetime debut show of\nthis season, Madam Secretary. In its\npilot episode, former CIA analyst\nElizabeth McCord (T\u00e9a Leoni) is\nhappily living in a semi-retired state,\nteaching politics and looking after\nhorses at her country ranch. But the\ncurrent Secretary of State is involved\nin a fatal plane crash, Elizabeth is\ncalled on personally by her mentor/\nfriend, the President of the United\nStates (Keith Carradine), to fill in the\nposition. Thrown into the deep end of\nWashington\u2019s political turmoil, each\nepisode sees Elizabeth deal with a\ncomplex diplomatic situation.\nLeoni excels in the central role,\nas she leads the rest of the cast of\ntalented supporting players. She\nprojects intelligence and charisma\nas she handles the most delicate\nconflicts in the most humane,\nsensible way, cleaning up after\npeople\u2019s mistakes, being responsible\nfor all American nationals on foreign\nsoil, having to sign off on potentially\ndangerous top-secret missions,\nand to top it all off, she still has the\nmystery of the former Secretary\nof State\u2019s death hanging over her\nhead. This season-long arc focuses\non what will most definitely develop\ninto a grand political conspiracy\nonce the show finds its footing. And\nmuch like The Good Wife in which\nevery episode involves an intriguing\n\u201ccase of the week\u201d procedural style\nas well as successfully adding one\nbig storyline to bring the season\u2019s\nepisodes together, Madam Secretary\nhas great potential to be just that.\nExcept that instead of having legal,\ncourtroom cases, the writers have\nmore room to explore, given the\npower and responsibilities the role of\nthe Secretary of State carries.\nHer staff, consisting of excellent\nactors Bebe Neuwirth, Patina Miller,\nGeoffrey Arend and Erich Bergen,\nall do their share of heavy-lifting in\nterms of adding both drama and the\nwell-placed humour into the office,\nbut also playing an equally big part in\nElizabeth\u2019s life is of course her family.\nThe way Leoni and Tim Daly (her\nhusband, Henry McCord) interact\ncompletely sell the idea that they\nhave been in a loving, committed\nrelationship for many years now, and\nthe show gives plenty of screen-time\nto their three children, adding more\nperspective and insight to the show.\nAll in all, it looks to be a great time\nfor women in television. These are\nonly a handful of primetime network\ndramas that are currently on air.\nCable is pushing the boundaries\neven further. And there is certainly\nnoticeable movement of actresses\nwho worked predominantly on films\nto head to TV for more complex,\ndeeper shows. And it is not difficult\nto see why. The material being offered\nin this industry is second to none, and\nwomen are no longer the supporting\nplayers, waiting to be rescued by\nmen. Instead they are the ones\ntaking charge, in powerful positions,\nmaking the important calls, and it is\na continuing trend that thankfully\nshows no signs of slowing down at any\ntime soon.\nCountry Music Queen Rayna James (left) takes the stage for her engagement, and on a slightly darker note, talented up-and-coming\nsinger Sadie Stone (right) has to deal with an abusive ex in Nashville\nElizabeth McCord is thrown\ninto Washington politics as the\nSecretary of State\n\n"

She also gets her\ninspiration from lookbook, a popular\nfashion blogging community where\npeople from all over the world upload\npicture of themselves wearing their\nfavourite outfits.\nBeing from Italy, Corinna\u2019s syle has\na distinctly European feel to it, often\nfeauturing darker, muted colours.\nSome of her fashion icons include\nBritish models Cara Delevingne, Kate\nMoss and famous art collector Peggy\nGuggenheim. Corinna has a weakness\nfor french designers, listing Celine,\nLanvin and Isabel Marant as some of\nher favourite labels.\nCorinna herself describes her style\nas European and minimalistic, with\na particular penchant for statement\njewellery. By combining high end\nand high street pieces, she looks\neffortlessly stylish and put together.\nJohn Ferguson is a 2nd\nyear\nmechanical engineering\nScotsman from Dundee. You\ncan usually spot him in the CGCU\nbuilding wearing an ultra suave suit\nor waiscoast. This time however, I\ncaught him on one of his more smart\ncasual days. John takes pride in the\nclothes he wears, preferring to blow\nhis student loan on nice clothes\ninstead of unnecessary things like\nsmart phones (he still walks around\nwith a pre-historic brick phone.)\nHowever, what he lacks in portable\ntech, he more than makes up for in\nbringing it in fashion stakes.\nJohn cites the popular men\u2019s\nfashion magazine GQ as a source of\nhis fashion inspiration, as well as\nmovies (probably James Bond). After\npressing him for a particular fashion\nicon, he mentions that he loves Eddie\nRedmayne\u2019s fashion sense. I don\u2019t\nblame him; Eddie Redmayne is a fine\nman indeed!\nDescribing his style as \u201cclassic\u201d and\n\u201cdapper\u201d, it\u2019s not surprising that he\nchooses to shop at places like Reiss,\nSuit Supply, Hugo Boss and All Saints.\nWhen he\u2019s feeling more high street,\nJohn\u2019s go-to store is always Uniqlo.\nGet the look\nLike the looks these guys and\ngals are wearing? Here are some\nof the essential items they\u2019re\nwearing that completed their\nlook.A simple outfit can always\nbe made to look more stylish\nwith a great pair of shoes or\naccessories.Invest in these,\nand you can even make a white\nt-shirt and jeans from H&M look\ngood.\nRay ban Wayfarers will always be in\nstyle, especially if you buy them in\nblack.\nSunglasses: The Sunglass Hut\nPrice: \u00a3125.00\nPhoto: C\u00e9cile Borkhataria Photo: C\u00e9cile Borkhataria\nWhere did she get\nit?\nBlack coat: Max Mara\nTop: Cividini\nJeans: Top Shop\nShoes: Asos\nNecklace: Urban\nOutfitters\nBag: Vive la difference\nWhere did he get\nit?\nJumper: Uniqlo\nJeans: Uniqlo\nShoes: Independent\nboutique in Italy\nWatch: Time Design\nBelt: vintage\nGlasses: Ray Ban\nHeadphones: Sony\nThese black shoes can be worn with\nanything \u2013 pair them with skinny\njeans for a casual look, or wear it with\na dress to tone down a feminine look.\nThese shoes are an edgier take on the\ntraditional Chelsea boot, and the heel\ngives a height boost for petite girls.\nShoes: Asos Daisy Street Black\nChunky Chelsea Boots\nPrice: \u00a334.99\nLaura De Arroyo Garcia (what\na mouthful) is a Spanish\nstudent studying Biochemistry\nwith Management. She describes\nher style as preppy, and gets her\ninspiration from ready to wear\nfashion collections and Instagram\nfashionistas, particularly Spanish\nones (of course).\nBeing Spanish, Laura loves a bit of\nZara. Combining affordable fashion\nwith high end looks, the brand is a\nfashion sensation for good reason.\nZara is practically an institution in\nSpain anyway, so you\u2019ll rarely come\nacross a Spaniard who doesn\u2019t love\nthe brand. Laura also loves high end\nbrands Yves Saint Laurent, Cavalli\nand Armani. She swears by Cavalli\nskinny jeans. They\u2019re the only jeans\nshe ever goes for because they give\n\u201cthe best fit\u201d.\nThe former IC cheerleader and\ngymnast often pairs her looks with\nsignature knee high boots, instantly\nand effortlessly dressing up any look.\nLaura\u2019s also very into jewellery, which\nis always important when one wants\nto \u2018girlify\u2019 a look. So what are her\ngo-to pieces of choice? Usually a pearl\nnecklace with an \u2018L\u2019 pendant letter\nfor her name. Oh, and her Rolex, of\ncourse!\nC\u00e9cile Borkhataria searches for the best dressed ladies and gents on campus, digging deep into where they get their fashion inspiration from\nAt first, Bilal Abou El Ela was\nslightly apprehensive about\nfeaturing in the spread,\nbut after some convincing, the\ntemptation to appear in Felix was all\nbut too much.\nBilal\u2019s not your traditional\nfashionista; it\u2019s all-natural for him.\nWhen it comes to where he gets his\ninspiration from, he insists that he\ndoesn\u2019t get his inspiration from any\nonline sources, blogs or websites.\nInstead, he believes his style has been\ndistinctly influenced by growing up\nin Spain.\nHe likes to wear light, colourful and\nsummery outfits. His put-together,\nsmart look is classically Spanish.\nWhen I asked him about his fashion\nicons, he couldn\u2019t think of a single\nguy. After some thought though,\nhe responded with, possibly, the\nmost unique answer I\u2019ve heard yet:\nhis father. Bilal channels his dad\u2019s\nSpanish fashion sense. And isn\u2019t that\nthe best gift a parent can give?\nIf you want to look as cool as Bilal,\nlook no further than Spanish retailer\nMassimo Dutti. He says they\u2019re the\nbest for trousers. For jumpers, Bilal\ngoes to preppy retailer Gant (the\nclosest one to IC is next to Harrods).\nNot surprisingly, Bilal also loves\nHugo Boss, and everything else that\u2019s\nstylish and \u201cnot too flashy\u201d.\nPandora bracelets have been a\nfashion sensation since 2003. The\nconcept is simple: buy a plain charm\nbracelet, and buy and accumulate\ncharms gradually. Eventually, you\u2019ll\nend up with a bracelet loaded with\ncharms!\nBracelet: Pandora Charm BraceletSterling Silver\nPrice: \u00a355.00\nA leather loafer is a man\u2019s best friend.\nThe instantly dress up a casual look,\nmaking you look more polished.\nShoes: River Island loafers with\nTassels\nPrice: \u00a350.00\nPhoto: C\u00e9cile Borkhataria\nPhoto: C\u00e9cile Borkhataria\nWhere did she get\nit?\nNecklace: Vintage\nSweater: Zara\nJeans: Just Cavalli\nBoots: Zara\nWatch: Rolex\nBracelet: Swarovski\nWhere did he get\nit?\nJumper: Springfield\nTrousers: Massimo\nDutti\nShoes: Vintage loafers\nWatch: Raymond Weil\nHave you spotted\nanyone fashionable\non campus?\nTake a picture and send it to\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk,\nand it could be published in\nthe next issue!\n\n"

He\nperformed new song, \u2018All Day\u2019, at\nthe Brits with a large variety of UK\ngrime artists (or rather they were\nmerely his hype-men). He\u2019d been on\nthe Jonathan Ross show on Friday\nto perform another new song, \u2018Only\nOne\u2019. He visited Oxford the following\nTuesday for a 20 minute talk on fine\nart, the Nobel Peace Prize and the\nclass system.\nThe most exciting thing happened\non the morning of Wednesday 4th\nMarch though; Kanye West was to\nperform a small club show at KOKO\nin Camden.

Entering\nKOKO, the dancefloor and stage\nwere in darkness and there was no\nmusic playing. All that could be seen\nfor the stage production was a blank\nscreen. People sang football chants to\nkeep themselves entertained but the\nexcitement was palpable.\nAt 01:00, the opening beats to\n\u2018All Day\u2019 came in and the crowd\nwent mental. People were crowd\nsurfing within seconds and then the\nmusic cut out. Skepta came on and\nperformed his hit \u2018That\u2019s Not Me\u2019 and\nI realised that this wasn\u2019t just a Kanye\nWest show, but rather the ultimate\nhip-hop concert with, importantly,\nUK grime artists represented. At any\nother show, this may not have worked\nbut the idea that Kanye West was\nin the back like an excited teenager\ngoing to his first concert and getting\nthe opportunity to be on stage showed\nthat he cared about this music and\nwasn\u2019t just jumping on a bandwagon.\nThe backdrop to the stage was\nremarkably simple; there was no Jesus\nactor, no mountains, no mask, no\nKim (thankfully). Heck, there weren\u2019t\neven any of his famous rants. The\nblank screen now had a slideshow\nof medieval woodcuts featuring the\ncrucifix and other associated images,\nas well as the rumoured artwork for\nSo Help Me God.\nMore grime hits such as \u2018German\nWhip\u2019 and \u201896 Fuckries\u2019 were played\nby members of Boy Better Know\nwith Kanye dancing away in the\nbackground. The crowd sung every\nword as if it was a Kanye hit. But\nwhen a Kanye hit did happen, such\nas \u2018Cold\u2019 which featured a snippet of\nForeigner\u2019s \u2018Cold as Ice\u2019, the crowd\nsung at West\u2019s command without him\nhaving to say a word. Whilst he didn\u2019t\nneed to try at all, this was Kanye at his\nmost pleasing, working his hardest\nand going all out to prove a point.\nThe most appropriate song for this\nshow was \u2018Clique\u2019 with the crowd\nenjoying it as much as the performers\nwere on stage. As everyone shouted\n\u2018Clique\u2019 back at Kanye, I realised\nthat Yeezy season had truly arrived.\nSkepta returned to perform his\nnewest song \u2018Shutdown\u2019 in which he,\nwell, shut it down. At the halfway\npoint, new songs from So Help Me\nGod were played. We had \u2018Wolves\u2019,\nwhich was debuted on American\nstaple Saturday Night Live. The\nremarkably simple song, whilst quite\nprofound, was a distinct change from\nthe general sound of Yeezus. The\nnew, never before played, track \u2018U\nMad\u2019 was performed. Similar in style\nto both \u2018Mercy\u2019 and a grime track,\nthe fact that it was a new song didn\u2019t\nstop the crowd singing it back after a\nminute of it being played. It had the\nanger of Yeezus but sounded nothing\nlike anything from that album.\nIt was at this point that the big\nhitters came out. \u2018We had Power\u2019,\n\u2018Can\u2019t Tell Me Nothing\u2019, \u2018All of the\nLights\u2019 and \u2018Good Life\u2019 all in a row,\nwith the little matter of a Big Sean\nappearance in the middle. Not all of\nhis hits were played; there was a lack\nof \u2018Stronger\u2019 and \u2018Gold Digger\u2019 but he\ndidn\u2019t need them considering \u2018Jesus\nWalks\u2019 from his debut album The\nCollege Dropout was dropped.\nAt this point, the song began and\nKanye was not happy. The wrong\nbackdrop was displayed and he\ndemanded the right backdrop was\nshown by shouting \u2018Next!\u2019 repeatedly\nat which point the computer used\nhad gone to the home screen and\nthe backdrop went completely dark.\nThere was a nervous laugh from the\ncrowd when Kanye said \u2018Next\u2019 again.\nEventually the right backdrop was\ndisplayed: a crucifix. Kanye then\nformed a crucifix pose in front of it\nwhile the crowd was unintentionally\nhyped by Kanye\u2019s tech guy fucking\nup. This was perhaps the highlight\nof the show up until this point as\nthe anger of Yeezus was on complete\ndisplay. But there were still some\nmore surprises and more demands to\ncome.\n\u2018Black Skinhead\u2019 was played and the\nbass of the song quite literally pushed\nme back, which brings me to the\nsound. It was loud, very loud. Almost\ntoo loud for a Wednesday at 2am but\nman, I\u2019m glad it was. I\u2019ve never been\nliterally moved by a song but Kanye\nhad done it. And then he stopped it,\ndemanded strobes and it began again.\nI was pushed back and the power of it\nhit me again.\nThen there was the biggest surprise\nof the night. Raekwon from Wu\nTang Clan, perhaps one of the most\ninfluential old school hip-hop groups,\ncame out and performed \u2018C.R.E.A.M.\u2019\nfrom Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),\nan album everyone should own. And\nhow did Kanye top that? He got every\nguest out and performed \u2018All Day\u2019, a\nsong which was received as if it was\nan instant classic in his canon. He left\nthe stage as did his entourage, then\nreturned a while later and played it\nagain. Kanye had shut down London\non a Wednesday morning before\nleaving for Paris the next day, having\nshown the UK how a hip-hop show\nshould be done, at the simplest level.\nNow where\u2019s his goddamn croissants?!\nPowerpoint can be a bitch.

    "content": "8 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n13.03.2015\nNews Editors Carol Ann Cheah, Cecily Johnson & Kunal Wagle\nWorld News\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAvideo of Abubakar Shekau,\nthe leader of the militant\nextremist group Boko Haram,\nhas emerged in which he swears\nallegiance to Islamic State (IS).\nThe message said: \u201cWe announce\nour allegiance to the Caliph of the\nMuslims and will hear and obey in\ntimes of difficulty and prosperity,\nin hardship and ease, and to endure\nbeing discriminated against, and\nnot to dispute about rule with those\nin power, except in case of evident\ninfidelity regarding that which there\nis a proof from Allah\u201d.\nThe Boko Haram leader\npurportedly goes on to say \u201cWe call\non Muslims everywhere to pledge\nallegiance to the caliph\u201d.\nThe Arabic audio message, which\nhas not yet been verified, was posted\non Boko Haram\u2019s Twitter account\non Saturday 7th\nMarch. Boko Haram\npreviously expressed support for the\nIslamic State in 2014 and, if verified,\nthis pledge by the Nigeria based\nextremist group would be the latest in\na series of allegiances sworn to IS by\nradical military organisations.\nAfter its founding in 2002, Boko\nHaram\u2019s increasing radicalisation led\nto a violent uprising in July 2009 in\nwhich its founder and then leader,\nMohammed Yusuf, was executed.\nThe group\u2019s subsequent six-year\nmilitary campaign after the uprising\nof 2009 has been so extreme that\nal-Qaida\u2019s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri,\nhas renounced Boko Haram\u2019s actions.\nSince Abubakar Shekau\u2019s\nappointment as leader the group\nhas killed over 5,000 civilians and\nmore than 1.5 million people have\nbeen displaced as they fled from the\nconflict zone.\nBoko Haram gained widespread\nmedia attention in April of last year\nafter the kidnapping of 276 Nigerian\nschoolgirls from the northeasterly\nregion of Chibok.\nMany of the mainly Christian\nstudents who were abducted in April\nhave been forced to convert to Islam\nand marry members of Boko Haram,\nreportedly being sold for a \u201cbride\nprice\u201d of just 2,000 Nigerian naira\n(less than \u00a37.00).\nIn May 2014, Abubakar Shekau\ntook responsibility for the\nabductions, claiming that \u201cAllah\ninstructed me to sell them,\u201d\nand saying \u201cI will carry out his\ninstructions\u201d. He has said the girls\nshould not have been in school and\ninstead should have been married.\nThe announcement of Boko\nHaram\u2019s pledge of allegiance to\nIslamic State was posted online\nshortly after female suicide\nbombers killed at least 50 people in\nthe northeastern Nigerian city of\nMaiduguri, which is in the Borno\nstate where Boko Haram originated.\nBoko Haram advocates for a strict\nform of sharia law to be imposed\nin their claimed territory and is\nprepared to kill anyone who does not\nconform to their ultraconservative\nfundamentalist form of Sunni Islam,\nknown as Wahhabism.\nThe group brutally enforces\nconservative Islamic traditions\nBoko Haram leader pledges allegiance\nto Islamic State\nJoshua Renken reports on the developments in the jihadist campaign\nAbubakar Shekau reportedly made the comments in a video posted on Twitter Photo: Wikimedia Commons\nand the caliphs (leaders) involved\nare seen by the membership as\npolitical successors to the prophet\nMohammad. The name \u201cboko haram\u201d\nis often translated as \u201cWestern\neducation is forbidden\u201d.\nThe group, which is believed to be\n10,000 strong, is currently operating\nin Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and\nChad. Together with Islamic State,\nBoko Haram intends to take over\nas much land as possible in order to\nspread their ideology.\nWhat is the Islamic State?\nFormerly known as The Islamic\nState of Iraq and Syria (ISIS),or The\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n(ISIL),Islamic State (IS) is the\nname given to the fundamentalist\nrebel terrorist group that controls\nterritory in north-western Iraq\nand northern Syria,along with\noperations in several other\ncountries in North Africa and the\nMiddle East.\nUntil recently,Islamic State went\nby the name of ISIS,which many\nWestern leaders (including David\nCameron and Barack Obama)\nwould refer to as ISIL.\u2018The Levant\u2019\nis an undefined region around the\nMiddle East,which was a preferred\nterm since Western governments\nwere very reluctant to declare a\nwar in Syria.\nIn June of 2014 the radicalised\nmilitant group announced that\nthey were going to drop the last\ntwo letters of their acronym and\ncall themselves Islamic State.\nDespite Islamic State not being\nwhat the majority of Muslims\nbelieve to be\u2018Islamic\u2019,nor a state,\nthis rebrand made it clear that\nthe organisation sees itself as a\nworldwide caliphate,not just a\nregional one.\nIslamic State now recruits from\naround the globe,including the\nUnited Kingdom.One particularly\nharrowing example is the\nradicalisation of University of\nWestminster computer science\ngraduate Mohammed Emwazi,who\nwas recently unmasked in reports\nas the British ISIS militant who\nappeared in videos showing the\nbeheading of journalists and aid\nworkers in Syria.\nEmwazi,who is sometimes\nreferred to as\u2018Jihadi John\u2019,had\nbeen known to MI5 and was on the\nHome Office Warnings Index,which\nprevented him leaving the country.\nHe is believed to have escaped from\nBritain in early 2013 by hiding in\na freight lorry on a Channel ferry,\nbefore travelling on to Turkey and\nthen Syria.\nIn the last few days Emwazi has\napologised for the problems he has\ncaused his family,but not for the\nexecution of several ISIS captives\nincluding British aid workers David\nHaines and Alan Henning.\nThe apology,which was sent via a\nthird party from Syria to his family,\nexpressed remorse for the\u201cproblems\nand trouble the revelation of his\nidentity has caused\u201d.Emwazi\u2019s\nfamily has been forced into hiding\never since his identification.\nJOSHUA RENKEN\nThe group have produced countless\npropaganda videos and are well\nfunded through various sources,\nreported to include kidnappings,\nrobberies, extortion, drug trafficking,\nsmuggling, poaching and donations\nfrom Islamist sympathisers,\nincluding other jihadist movements.\nBoko Haram are an organised\nand ambitious group who have\ncommitted truly unthinkable acts\nagainst humanity and pose an even\ngreater threat to millions of civilians\nafter their pledge of allegiance to IS.\nThe jihadist campaign is now being\nfought across two continents, and\nofficials in Washington have called\nIslamic State \u201cprobably the best-funded terrorist organisation\u201d the US\nhas ever confronted.\nThe group is believed to be\nbankrolled to the tune of around one\nmillion dollars a day through wealthy\nprivate donors in the Middle East and\nthe sale of oil from fields in Syria and\nIraq.\n\n"

After\nconsolidating their position in the\nthird tier of BUCS, the team now find\nthemselves one game away from the\nLUSL league title. With a cup Semi\nFinal still to come, this could prove\nto be one of their most successful\nseasons in recent history.\nIC triumphed 3-2 over their Medic\ncounterparts earlier in the season,\nbut critics do not expect this reverse\nfixture to be anywhere near as close.\nWith a philosophy that encourages\nfree flowing attacking football and a\nbrand of play that is sure to get fans\noff their seats, IC will be expected\nto put their opponents to the sword\nfrom the very first minute.\nAnd with the most potent attacking\nduo in university football, Robinson\nand Murphy, leading the line, the\nruthless streak that has defined IC\u2019s\nperformances all season will really\ncome to the fore. Expect goals. Expect\nfireworks.

The rebuild\nthat begun last season, with heroic\nrelegation battles, has continued this\ncampaign.\nIn BUCS we have cemented our\nplace in the league and done well to\nprevent free-fall; the highlight being\na 10-0 aggregate win over Canterbury.\nIn LUSL things has been tough, as\nlife should be in the Premier League.\nWe have pitted our wits against the\nfirst teams from the big London\nuniversities and although we\u2019ve often\ncome up second, it has been by fine\nmargins.\nAn agonising 3-2 defeat to our\nVarsity counterparts was somewhat\ncompensated by a victory against IC\n2s. The aforementioned defeat was\na thoroughly enjoyable and evenly\nmatched game against our great\nrivals. Our UH dream is still alive, but\nin the meantime, we fully intend to\nget some silverware under our belt.\nOur defence is built on the heroic\nefforts of Tom Page and Hugh Ford\nwhilst our 3 pronged attack offer\nstrength and dynamism, not least\nthanks to Kem Onubogu \u2013 playing\nin his final Varsity. A home fixture\nis long overdue in Varsity and this\nyear we welcome Imperial College to\nHeston\u2026 let battle commence.\nSquad:\nHugh Ford (GK)\nThomas Page\nKen Mawhinney\nJonathon Topping\nThomas Stroud\nJoshua Welsh\nKavian Kulasabanathan (VC)\nMichael David (C)\nAvi Korman\nAdam Green\nImafidon \u2018Don\u2019 Oboh\nIfeanyi \u2018Kem\u2019 Onubogu\nPatrick McGown\nSamad Wahid\nQamar Mustafa\nJack Healy\nChristian Cave\nThe 2s are constantly improving\non great performances, and are\nassured of a very successful season\nin both BUCS and LUSL leagues.\n2nd spot seems secured in BUCS\nafter promotion last year, and a\nteam has been built to challenge for\npromotion next year.

It starts with the little,\nsubtle signs for Alice (Moore). A few\nwords here and there, and forgetting\nwhat she just discussed with her\nfamily. As a lecturer she struggles\nwith pauses, and later on, not\nremembering what she was supposed\nto teach on that particular day. Her\nperformance as a linguistics professor\nsuffers as a result of this, and the\nharsh but honest feedback from her\nstudents forces her to face her reality.\nHer initial assessment with the\ndoctors reveals a troubling diagnosis,\nand it is all downhill from there for\nher memory. Making things worse is\nthe hereditary nature of her disease.\nShe not only worries for her, but for\nher young children (Kristen Stewart,\nKate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish) as\nwell, with even the possibility of her\nchildren passing this onto her future\ngrandchildren also being something\nshe cannot rule out.\nMoore is an actress who continues\nto raise the bar she sets for herself in\na league of her own. Her filmography\nreads like a long list of performances\nshe should have been, and to a certain\nextent was, awarded heavily for,\nand with this stunning, emotionally\nresonant film she finally gets her due.\nFor as long as she has some control,\nAlice frantically tries to jog her\nmemory in whatever way she can, but\nas her audience we see the difficult\nand inevitable deterioration. Her\nhusband John (Alec Baldwin) remains\nas supportive as he can, although he\nSTILL ALICE\nDirectors: Richard Glatzer,\nWash Westmoreland\nScreenplay: Richard Glatzer,\nWash Westmoreland, Lisa\nGenova (novel)\nCast: Julianne Moore, Alec\nBaldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate\nBostworth, Hunter Parrish\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nJulianne Moore\u2019s Oscar-winning triumph\nPhoto: Richard Glatzer, Wash Westmoreland, Sony Pictures Classics\nKILL THE MESSENGER\nDirector: Michael Cuesta\nScreenplay: Peter Landesman,\nGary Webb (book), Nick Schou\n(book)\nCast: Jeremy Renner, Mary\nElizabeth Winstead\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nIn a time where the cases of\nEdward Snowden and Julian\nAssange are still left unresolved,\nKill the Messenger serves as a timely\npiece to show how the practice of\nwhistle-blowing can be a deadly game\nto get yourself into. Jeremy Renner\nheads this at-times flimsy but oddly\ncaptivating conspiracy thriller in\nwhich he is that classic old-school\ncharacter of a newspaper journalist\nacting like a dog with a bone.\nSensing that he has stumbled upon\nwhat could be the biggest story of his\ncareer, Gary Webb (Renner) ignores\nthe obvious warnings and dangers\nsurrounding his passion project,\nand continues digging in his search\nfor the truth. What he uncovers\nis detrimental for the important\npeople high up in the government:\nWebb is convinced that the Central\nIntelligence Agency (CIA) directly\nplayed a part in supplying huge\namounts of cocaine to be sold in the\npoorest, most desperate parts of the\nUnited States, and used the huge\nprofits from the sales to fund the\nNicaraguan Contras rebel army.\nDamning allegations for sure,\nand getting involved in such murky\nwaters is bound to upset a lot of\npeople. Initially a happily-married\nfamily man, Webb goes through\nthe clich\u00e9d change of prioritising\nhis work over his family. His wife\nSue (Rosemarie DeWitt) is the first\nredundant character of many, as she\nplays the tired, same old role of a\nworried wife who wishes her husband\nwould stay at home to look after their\nchildren.\nHis personal investigation into\nthe matters at hand proves exciting\nhowever, well worth the hours spent\npursuing numerous individuals and\nchasing up leads, sometimes taking\nhim outside his home country. His\neditor Anna Simons (Mary Elizabeth\nfinds himself having to make the\nchoice between caring for his wife in a\nfull-time capacity, and furthering his\ncareer that is on the rise.\nMoore\u2019s restrained Oscar-winning\nperformance is faultless in every\nframe, and the film is not afraid to\nshow all the potential ugly sides the\ncondition carries with it. Alice unable\nto keep a sense of direction leads to\nrather frightening consequences,\nher safety-net back-up plan for\nwhen things become unbearable for\nher is devastating. This truly is an\nextraordinary, heartfelt tale with no\nfancy, complicated story behind it. It\nsolely focuses on the woman herself,\nher step-by-step decline, and in its\ndeceptive simplicity, it is outstanding\nbecause of it.\nAlice\u2019s moving speech at an\nAlzheimer\u2019s conference, awkwardly\nstrung together by a woman quite\nseverely affected by the condition at\nthe point, with uncomfortable gaps\nand with an understandable level of\nnerves from the character, is no doubt\nthe tear-jerking highlight of the film.\nTry to resist crying listening to that.\nAlthough given its grave, sensitive\nsubject matter, the film wisely stays\naway from relying on melodramatic\nplot points. This truly is the most\npersonal and intimate a character\nstudy can get, one that results in a\ndeeply touching conclusion.\nThat Alzheimer\u2019s disease is\nincurable makes the film\u2019s ending\nall the more important, something\nStill Alice handles appropriately.\nDirectors Wash Westmoreland and\nRichard Glatzer hit the inspirational\nnote they intended on capturing,\nwithout offensively sugar-coating\nthe hardship that comes with it. Alice\nBrown has a lot to teach us, in her life\nthat was well lived and fulfilled.\nWhatever happened to Gary Webb?\nWinstead) is cautiously optimistic, as\nhe insists that he does not believe in\nconspiracy theories. He does however\nbelieve in real conspiracies. And the\nmore that he uncovers, the more we\nare inclined to agree with him.\nRenner, despite being an integral\npart of three huge action franchises\n(The Avengers, Mission Impossible,\nthe Bourne series), is someone who\nstill finds the time to show off his\ndramatic versatility and acting\nprowess in the relatively smaller,\nless-seen films. As Gary Webb,\nRenner more than suits the scruffy,\nworn-down look, and his worsening\nobsession towards the story plays\nout well throughout the film, as does\nhis paranoid tendency. His passion\nshines through, even in the film\u2019s\nweakest moments, as he convincingly\nportrays the likeable underdog. Being\na journalist working for a relatively\nsmall newspaper, there is a sense that\nhe has bitten off way more than he\ncan chew, although the controversial\nreport does manage to make its\nappearance on the newspaper\u2019s\npainfully old-fashioned, 90s website,\nwhich is when all hell breaks loose.\nIt does not take long for the\nmainstream news to gobble this up in\nits 24-hour news cycle, with messages\nof both support and condemnation\nfrom various parties flying across\nevery media outlet. But ultimately\nthere is pressure from the powers that\nbe, one that is too difficult to ignore.\nWebb\u2019s reputation is tarnished\nand his article discredited for \u2018poor\nresearch\u2019. Just exactly who is doing\nwhat at what level is shrouded in\nmystery, perhaps due to the fact\nthat even to this day, it is not clearly\nknown. But the point is, his life is\nfalling apart, as people from both\nhis professional and personal lives\nstart pulling away from him, and the\nsupport that he once thought could\nrely on, is no more. Renner amps up\nhis game in the second half, as the\ncharacter grows more helpless with\nfewer places to turn to.\nIn the end, as with pretty much\nany conspiracies/cover-ups, it will be\nimpossible to know to what extent the\nreport was true. There are still doubts\nas to the circumstances surrounding\nGary Webb\u2019s death (it was eventually\nruled as a suicide). But whatever\nthe case, the story of Gary Webb\nand his passion and ego fuelling\nhis investigative journalism is one\nthat is difficult to forget, thanks\nlargely in part to Renner\u2019s solid lead\nperformance.\nPhoto: Michael Cuesta, Focus\nFeatures\nPhoto: Michael Cuesta, Focus\nFeatures\n\n"

As a result, both\nteams were eager to claim the mental\nboost that comes with winning.\nFortress Harlington provided ideal\nconditions for a running game of\nrugby, yet another reason why this\nwas set to be a good match.\nThe medics were nowhere to be\nseen for the first 20 minutes, and\nan early penalty for IC got the score\nboard moving the right way. Shortly\nafter, a strong \u201cSonny Bill\u201d from\nSkipper Cox allowed Moorby to make\nan excellent line break down the\nleft hand side, finally stepping in\ntowards the posts to force the 2-on-1\nwith Durkin on his inside. Terrible\nbutterfingers meant Durkin dropped\nthe ball over the line, but luckily for\nAlmost immediately after the\nrestart, excellent phase work from\nImperial led to Cox bringing the\nbacks down the blind side and\nmaking a half break. Again excellent\noffloading to Moorby gave him an\nunmarked run in from the medic\n10-metre line. 17 - 0.\nA monster restart from Cox forced\nan error from the medic full back,\nknocking the ball into touch just\noutside their 22. A big lineout\nfollowed with College winning the\nball. The phase play was at too high\na tempo for the defence to deal with.\nDurkin subsequently put Hedley in\nfrom close quarters for another try\nout wide. 22 - 0.\nThe next 10 minutes of the game\nsaw the medics win back the restart\nand put considerable pressure on the\nanother excellent kick by Cox. The\nchase meant that the medics were\nkept in their 22 and their slow phase\ngame meant that the IC defence had\nplenty of time to reset. This finally\nresulted in the medic flanker being\nbundled into touch 8 metres out.\nOne thing was inevitable; the\nCollege maul is unstoppable from\nthat kind of distance. A maul that\ncould only be described as clinical,\nclassy and \u201cunsuitable for minors\u201d\nwas formed leaving the medic pack\ntrailing in their wake and seeing\nHedley dot down for his brace, giving\nCollege a 27-0 lead at half-time.\nNobody was ready for what\nhappened almost directly after half-time. IC\u2019s very own resident \u201clion\nwrestler\u201d Tom Hedley received the\nball on the IC 22, proceeded to step\nboth their winger and 13 back inside,\nfollowed by a huge fend on the medic\n10 on the halfway line. Carnage. He\nthen took the outside line, breaking\nthree more tackles, with only 40\nmetres and the opposition fullback\nleft. He turned on the afterburners\nto outpace the last man and touch\ndown under the posts to complete his\nhat trick. Insanity. It was a try that\nBilly Vunipola could only dream\nof scoring. If only Stuart Lancaster\nhad seen it, I am convinced Hedley\nwould have been fast tracked to\nstarting for England this weekend.\nNo conversion, again. 32 - 0.\nIt looked like the game could have\nHenry Legge reports from Harlington as College thump Medics just a week from\nshowdown at The Stoop\ndescended into a farcical score, when\nsoon after the restart patient play\nthrough 12 phases saw a sublime 25\nmetre pass from \u201cwide boy\u201d Durkin,\nputting Moorby over the white line.\n39 - 0.\nFrom there on, the medics enjoyed\na high percentage of possession. IC\u2019s\ndefence was excellent for the most\npart of it, but they did allow the\nmedics to build a solid maul and\nbreak down the blindside to score\nfrom close quarters.\nIn summary, it was a good first half\nfrom IC but apart from two moments\nof magic, a very scrappy second. It\nwas a big statement of intent before\nvarsity, and had College stayed at\nthat intensity for the full 80 it could\nhave been even more of a cricket\nscore.\nA special mention must go to Josh\n\u201chead in the clouds\u201d O\u2019Donnell who\nat one point had a 40 metre free run\nin down the wing, however decided\nto try and step inside some invisible\nopposition, ending up running into\nreal opposition.\nCan the College repeat the success of Varsity in 2013?

This\nalready difficult game was made\nworse by the fact that playmaker\nPollock was side-lined by an injured\nhamstring and Mejnertsen was\nstill recovering from a knee injury,\nleaving only 12 players available\nto play. Despite this, the IC team\nwas looking strong and up for the\nchallenge with Cerulus finally able\nto make a game!\nA slightly shaky start by King\u2019s\nleft them vulnerable to the counter\nattack and although the ball was\npicked a couple of times from their\ndefenders, unfortunately the IC\nforwards could not capitalise on the\nopportunities their solid defensive\nplay had created. At the other end\nof the pitch IC\u2019s back line of Jones,\nAlton and Murray did a great job\nof shutting down King\u2019s skillful\nforwards, while transferring and\ndistributing the ball well when in\npossession. Any entry to our D was\nmet with the brick wall of MeyerBothling, determined this time to\nkeep his clean sheet.\nThe game remained at 0-0 for some\ntime, with neither side having the\nclear upper hand in the game. Just\nbefore half time the King\u2019s defence\nthrew a long aerial ball into our\n23, Alton saw the opportunity for a\ngreat cover drive but sadly caught\nan outside edge, allowing the King\u2019s\nforward through on goal. There was\nnothing Meyer-Bothling could do\nthis time and a good finish by the\nKing\u2019s forward put the score to 1-0.\nThere were no snacks at half time,\nbut a good team talk from coach\nCooper meant that IC came out\nfighting in the second half. King\u2019s\nheld more possession but both sides\nwere creating chances, with the\nholy trinity of Logtestijn, Vaquero\nand Cerulus in the centre playing\nsimple and effective hockey and\ndistributing the ball to Hedgecock\nand Price on the wings. 2nd team\ncall up Edwards looked at home,\nmaking some crucial tackles and\nlinking up well with the midfield.\nGood movement from Breakey and\nDittmar led to a handful of penalty\ncorners, but despite two drag flickers\nand several rehearsed routines IC\nwere unable to find the back of the\nnet, with the King\u2019s keeper making\nsome great saves.\nThere was a similar story at\nthe other end of the pitch and\nskillful play from the King\u2019s attack\nrewarded them with several penalty\ncorners. However, Meyer-Bothling\nchannelled his inner Nicolas Jacobi\nand made some first class saves to\nkeep the ball out of the goal. IC kept\ncreating chances until the final\nwhistle but unfortunately could not\nconvert and the game ended 1-0 to\nKings.\nThanks to the Ladies 1s for their\ncontinued support.\nMan of the Match: Oliver MeyerBothling.\nThe 3rd XV have had a rather\ndisappointing year. The\napathy of BUCS in doing\nlittle or nothing to resolve the issue\nof South Eastern 7A having only 2\nteams left the threes despondent, and\na heavy defeat away in their single\nmatch so far was not the start we\nwere looking for. Hungry for a win\nafter the previous match, the 3rd\nXV hosted Chichester at Harlington,\notherwise known as \u2018The Fortress\u2019. To\nput the icing on the cake, the referee\nwas none other than Big Bad Bob\nCoutts, extremely enthusiastic in his\ncorrespondence with the captain.\nThe day started off with an\nembarrassing entrance, being given\nour marching orders to \u2018Little\nHarlington\u2019 changing rooms; the\nluxuries of the big rooms were\nreserved for the sheer quantity of\nnumbers in the lacrosse squads. After\nstruggling for air in changing rooms\nbeing compared to \u201cHarry Potter\u2019s\ncupboard under the stairs\u201d, we arrived\non the pitch half an hour before kick\noff, and an hour and a half after the\narrival of our opposition.\nThe first half was a tight affair, with\nboth teams given scant opportunities.\nThere were, admittedly, some\nsquandered chances down to \u2018white\nline fever\u2019, a syndrome that has\nknown to affect Will Spenceley Jones\nboth on and off the pitch. Some key\nmoments involved Edric getting\nkneed in the nose, causing a nosebleed\nlasting 50 minutes, and Vincent\n\u2018Weak Bladder\u2019 Desforges retiring\nwith a fractured elbow. Luckily we\nhad more than one substitute this\nweek, and the replacements proved\nto be more than capable. It turned\nout to be a forwards-dominated\nhalf, unsurprising given the rotund\nphysiques of the opposition. Imperial\nwere unfortunate in conceding in the\nvery last play of the half, down to a\nhuge overlap and a free kick taken\nquickly.\nThe second half saw a rejuvenated\nImperial side pick up the pressure,\nin particular the scrums were highly\neffective. Tom Johnstone and the\nprodigal son, Merlin Potter-Adams,\ngiving some push, with Will Jackson\nstruggling to maintain his temper\nin between. After more forwards\nplay, and some decent kicking,\nImperial had a scrum on the 5m line.\nNaturally, the pack dominated, and\nTim \u2018Specialist Number 8\u2019 Harrington\ncontrolled the ball from the back to\ntouch down.\nAn early highlight was some\noutstanding linkup play from the\nresidents of Batoum; number 8\nHarrington taking it from the back of\na scrum, making important yardage\nbefore popping it to number 9 Arm,\nwho drew his man and released\nsecond row/full back Prichard for a\nsearing run, stopping short of the try\nline to throw an outrageous sonny-bill to Leonard.\nChichester hit back, with another\ntry due to flustered heads and a\ncouple of unfortunate missed tackles,\nbut the side stayed positive.\n10 minutes was spent camped in\nthe opposition half, before \u2018old-hat\u2019\nWill Jackson reminded his captain\nand scrum-half that box kicks were\na useful tactic. Look Arm took heed,\nand gave the slippery Chichester\nfull-back some challenges. These\ngained good territory, and after\nsome intelligent running by man\nof the match, and self proclaimed\nBNOC, Ciro Monti, Imperial\u2019s second\ntry was scored. Leonard slotted the\nconversion and we were back on\ntrack. A similar situation gifted Ciro\nyet another try, proving his worth in\nany position he may attempt to play.\nWe were 19-14 up, with around 5\nminutes to play.\nAfter \u2018time where we clench our\nbuttocks\u2019, with Chichester almost\nrunning through us, we found\nourselves in last play, with our own\nlineout. This we took, and won, which\nhad been the theme all match. We\nwere left with the decision to take\nthe win, or go for the last try to add\ninsult to injury. The maul was strong,\nand despite being slapped round the\nface, prop-come-back row-come-prop\nLocke Macgregor wriggled through\nChichester to score a final try in the\ncorner and seal a 24-14 victory.\nImperial lose close game to KCL 1-0\nRevenge is a dish best served cold\nPhoto: IC Rugby\nJAMES BREAKEY\nIC HOCKEY\nLUKE ARMITAGE\nIC RUGBY 3RD XV\nPhoto: IC Basketball\nPhoto: Davina Cochrane\nFencing\nclaim four\nmedals at\nBUCS\nImperial College Fencing Club\ncompeted at last weekend\u2019s\nBUCS individual championships\nin Sheffield and in the process\nwon a total of 4 medals! Men\u2019s\nsabre and women\u2019s foil took place\non the first day: Imperial has a\nreputation of dominating sabre\nand yet again lived up to that\nreputation with an all-Imperial\nfinal between men\u2019s 1st team\nfencers Maiyuran Ratneswaran\nand Chris Lawrence.As both\nfencers are in their last year there\nwas an increased determination\nfrom both sides to bring home\nthe gold (even though they live\nin the same flat) and after a\nspectacular display of world-class\nsabre,it was Maiyuran who was\nvictorious winning his 5th BUCS\ntitle 15-12.\nIt seemed hard to repeat\nthis feat on the second day but\nit started off in a similar way\nin the men\u2019s foil with S\u00f8ren\nPfitzner being seeded 2nd after\nthe poules in his first BUCS\nindividuals.He fought well all\nday and eventually went out in\nthe last 16,finishing 9th of 149.\nHowever,women\u2019s \u00e9p\u00e9e was also\non the second day and it was in\nthis event that another medal\nwas won,this time a bronze from\nFrancesca Cavallo who fenced\nskilfully all day,losing 14-13\nin the semi-final in a\u2018sudden\ndeath\u2019extra minute.Indeed,in\na strong field of 79,women\u2019s\n\u00e9p\u00e9e saw multiple significant\nperformances from Imperial\nfencers: Caitlin Jones finished\n6th,knocked out by Francesca in\na very close fight that finished\n15-14,and Maria Constantinescu\nfinished 12th.\nThe last day of the competition\nwas full of expectations for\nanother medal and Zoe Robinson\ndid not disappoint,winning\nthe silver medal in the final;\nmatch of the championships,\nhaving dominated throughout\nthe day.Imperial\u2019s total of four\nmedals was the highest number\nwon by any team at the fencing\nchampionships and placed\nImperial second in the standings,\nbehind Cambridge who gained\ntwo gold medals.All in all,it\nwas a more than satisfactory\nweekend!\nJAMIE SIMPSON\nIC FENCING\nOn Wednesday 18th March\nthe Imperial women\u2019s\nWater Polo team travelled\nto Loughborough to play their\nChampionship knock-out match.\nA win would mean going through\nto the Semi-Finals. We finished\n5th in the Premier South division\nwhile Loughborough finished 4th\nin the Premier North division,\nso we were expecting a very tight\nmatch, especially as we had less\nthan 24 hours\u2019 notice for this match\nto organise transport, get a team\ntogether and mentally prepare.\nWe arrived in Loughborough\nat 11:45 for a 12:30 start with a\nsmall team (as usual) with only\n1 substitute, a novelty for us\nconsidering the match before against\nCardiff we had no subs and had to\nplay the second half man down,\nand still managed a draw! We made\na great start by winning the first\nquarter 2-0 with both goals coming\nfrom Sophie Linney. Such a strong\nstart is very unusual for us as we\nnormally like to make it difficult\nfor ourselves by having to get back\ninto the match! This scoring streak\ncontinued into the second quarter\nwith us extending the lead to 5-0\nwith another goal from Sophie\nLinney and 2 goals from Alexandra\nCharleson. The match still wasn\u2019t\nwon as anything can happen, but\nwe were sitting very comfortably at\nhalf time and knew that a win was\nwithin in our grasp. With the score\nat 7-0 after the third quarter, we were\nconfident the match was won and\nthe aim was to now do our goalie,\nLillan Agerup, justice and keep a\nclean sheet. The final score was 9-0\nwith two of the second half goals\ncoming from Sophie Linney and the\nother two from Corrine Bacigal. This\nwas an absolutely fantastic team\nperformance from the girls and the\nresult rewarded everyone\u2019s hard work\nand the best team on the day won.\nImperial are now through to the\nBUCS Championship round robin\nSemi-Finals which will take place\non 14th/15th of March in Sheffield.\nWe will play three gruelling matches\nover this weekend against Sheffield\nHallam, Cardiff and Bristol, which\nwill require hard work from the\nwhole team but we have a great\nchance of getting through to the\nFinals. Considering Imperial only\ngot promoted to the Premier division\nthis year, we have done ourselves\nvery proud already by not only\nstaying up, but also getting to the\nSemi\u2019s.\nEarly mornings, grey skies, and\ndowncast drizzle could do\nnothing to dampen the spirits\nof Imperial College Taekwondo\n(ICUTKD), as the 24 strong team\n\u2013 the largest in the club\u2019s history \u2013\npiled into two minibuses to troop\nto the British Student Taekwondo\nNational Championships, in the\nancient cathedral city of Worcester.\nAfter ranking 3rd\nnationally in\nthe previous year, ICUTKD hoped\nto build upon their success over the\ntwo days of sparring, patterns, and\nspiritedness that makes up the British\nStudent Taekwondo Championships.\nWith intense competition from\na pool of 387 competitors across\n42 clubs, ranging from Exeter to\nGlasgow (to say nothing of the\n50 strong team from Imperial\u2019s\nperennial rivals, UCL), outperforming\nthe diverse and talented competition\nseemed an almost impossible goal.\nYet, ICUTKD managed to rise to the\nchallenge in a spectacular fashion,\nnabbing 30 Medals (10 gold, 5 silver,\n15 bronze) from its 24 strong pool,\nin addition to placing first in Female\nTeam sparring; enough to place third\nnationally for overall WTF sparring\nperformance, and fourth nationally\nacross both sparring and patterns.\nWith the biggest student\nTaekwondo competition behind\nthem, ICUTKD are far from\ncomplacent. Setting their sights on\nthe next academic year, they hope\nto host their own competition (for\nthe fourth consecutive year) and\ninter-university training sessions,\nin addition to building upon their\nsuccesses in Worcester.\nICUTKD train on Mondays and\nSaturdays in the Union Gym and\nThursdays in Activity Space 2.\nImperial through to semis\nTaekwondo visit the Nationals in Worcester\nSOPHIE LINNEY\nIC WATER POLO\nNATHANIEL GALLOP\nIC TAEKWONDO\nSunday 8th March saw the game\nwe had been waiting for all\nseason, the London Bowl 2015.\nThe Imperial Immortals and the\nKing\u2019s College London Regents have\na fierce rivalry after first playing\nsix years ago where Kings won and\ncreated the London Bowl trophy.\nHowever, for the past few years it has\nstayed in South Kensington with the\nImmortals as King\u2019s have struggled to\nkeep up.\nThe Immortals started the\ngame kicking off and the Regents\nstarted with a strong drive that\nthe Immortals\u2019 defense was more\nthan equal to, keeping them out\nof the endzone and forcing them\nto punt. The Immortals offense\nwent out and played like they had\na point to prove running the ball\nhard through Le\u2019Bami Falana who\npicked up a filthy four touchdowns\non the day. He ran harder and\nfaster than ever and really deserved\nsuch a performance after such a\nstrong season. Together Le\u2019Bami,\nD\u2019Emanuel and Rayane Hobollah\nhave been the battering rams that\nhave pushed hard every step to\ndrive the team forward with their\nrunning this season. Toby Sinclair\nplayed well and cleverly on the\nday, as he has all season, avoiding\nsacks and keeping drives alive. He\nalso picked up a touchdown on\nthe day with a QB sneak \u2013 classic\nSinclair. The Immortals defense\nhad a great day on the field too,\nonly letting in one touchdown, with\nGuillaume \u2018G\u2019 Fontan making tackles\nall over the field and Panukorn\nTaleongpongdong playing hard\nkilling people in the middle of the\nfield. J\u00f6rn \u2018Gorab\u2019 J\u00f6rg gets a special\nmention for causing two fumbles\nwith his impressive and extensively\npracticed stripping routine.\nWill \u2018Angry but Prez\u2019 Nicholson\nrecovered two fumbles and swatted\none down with his ridiculous club,\nway to step up pal. Special case\nof the day award, and Immortals\nStone, goes to Alex Hitchinson\nfor managing to kick a field goal\nattempt into one of his own players\nheads \u2013 maybe next time Hitch. A\nmoment of silence was needed for\nLittle Harry Collini\u2019s elbow after it\ntook a hefty hit from a helmet and\nbasically became jelly.\nHowever, all in all a great day was\nhad by everyone and it was nice for\nthe Immortals to get some well-deserved success. We wish to thank\nall of our supporters that came to\nwatch us beat King\u2019s 32-6.\nImmortals thrash KCL\nSAM HILL\nIMPERIAL IMMORTALS\nPhoto: IC Taekwondo\n\n"

The festival marks the\ntime when the ancestral spirits visit the Earth and ends on Kuningan when\nthey return. As offerings to the returned spirits, penjor \u2013 bamboo poles with\nofferings suspended on one end are installed along the side of the roads.\nA curious fact is that the holiday follows the 210-day pawukon calendar,\ntherefore take place twice a year.

Finally, the\nday before the festival is Penampahan, the slaughter day where animals are\nsacrificed as an offerings. On the day, Balinese will pray at temples and make\ntheir offering, followed by visiting of close friends the day after. Despite the\nfact that many places will be closed for the day, you will get to see colourfully\nflocked Balinese making their way to the temple, as well as local restaurants\noffering their native dishes.\nTime: Wednesday of the 11th\nweek of 210-day pawukon calendar (15th\nJuly,\n2015; 10th\nFebruary, 2016)\nOfficial website: there isn\u2019t one since it is a religious holiday\nCape York Peninsula,\nAustralia - Laura\nAboriginal Dance Festival\nStarted out in the early 1980s within the communities\nof Cape York, this biennial three-day festival celebrates\nand showcases the Aboriginal culture through dancing,\nstorytelling and singing.

Almost every shrine has\ntheir own, with a procession consisting of men in\ntraditional garb carrying dashi (temple-like float)\ncarrying the kami (deity) across the streets. One of\nthe most famous is the Gion Matsuri in Kyoto of the\nYasaka Shrine that occurs through the whole of July,\nwith two parades (17/7 and 24/7) consisting of floats\nup to 20 m tall. It originated as a purification ritual\nto appease gods that are thought to cause natural\ndisasters by the Emperor Seiwa. Food stalls, festival\ngames are also set up on streets with girls dressed in\nyukata (summer kimono).

These lanterns are made out of bamboo stick, covered with thin oiled paper or tissue\nwith a ball dipped in kerosene inside. It is believed that they were invented by the famous military strategist\nKung Ming (181 \u2013 234 A.D.) during the Three Kingdoms Era in China, hence are also called \u2018Kung Ming\nLanterns\u2019. The Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival is set in the remote mountain village of Taiwan and is part of the\ncelebration of Chinese New Year. It has a less ancient origin, beginning in 1990 as a tradition from war-time\ncommunication. It is a unique combination of parade, fireworks and sky lanterns that attract thousands\nof tourists each year. It is said that releasing the lantern into the air with wishes written on it can bring its\nfulfilment.\nTime: Lunar New Year (usually around February)\nOfficial Website: http://timefortaiwan.tw/cal_en/cal_19543\nSpectacular sight where thousands of people release\nlanterns filled with wishes to the sky. Photo: flickr Ah Ki\nIndia \u2013 Holi festival\nInspiring powdered throwing celebrations around the world, Holi festival is the mother\nof all colour festivals. An ancient Hindu festival, the tradition of throwing coloured\npowders originated from the Braj region of India. Krishna, a Hindu deity with dark\nblue skin from drinking poisoned breast milk feared no one would love him, and his\nmother encouraged him to colour Radha\u2019s face in any colour he wants and the two\nbecame a couple. The festival celebrates the beginning of spring, but also with religious\nsymbolism commemorating the triumph of Vishnu and her son over the demon\nking Hiranyakashipu and his sister Holika. The latter was burnt in a bonfire that is\nrecreated on the night before the festival. Its first record was by poet Kalidasa during\nthe 4th\ncentury. The day is for pure enjoyment and partying, with only one aim: the\ncolour everyone. Traditionally, natural colour powders such as turmeric are used, but\nnowadays any methods from water balloons to coloured solutions are fair game. The\nfestival is traditionally celebrated in India and Nepal, but has gained popularity all\nover the world. To see what a traditional Holi is like, go to Mathura and Vrindavan; for\nmodern Holi, then Delhi is the place.\nTime: Phalgun Purnima, typically in March\nOfficial website: http://www.holifestival.org/\nA parade during the celebration of Gawai\nDayak.

I\u2019m not a certain though but I think most of the guests\nwere strippers. Was weird though, they were all dressed like Margret Thatcher\nand were simultaneously of Asian decent \u2013 they refused to speak to me unless I\npretended to be a coal miner..\nSUNDAY 8th March\nI\u2019ve started my year of being 19 waking up on a boat on the Themes and I have\nno idea how it happened. It wasn\u2019t a normal boat either, I\u2019m pretty sure it was a\ndecorative one from a pirate themed kid\u2019s play area \u2013 either way I\u2019m surprised it\nstayed afloat. I lost my phone and had to call for help, the coast guard didn\u2019t believe\nme when I said I lived in London and I got sent to Scotland Yard as an illegal\nimmigrant suspect.\nThey made me spend the night in a holding cell while they called the uni to see if\nI was legit.\nThey called Kris... I\u2019m not sure what he said but they didn\u2019t seem pleased, I\u2019m pretty\nsure he got me deported \u2013 mother fucker\nMONDAY 9th March\nIt turns out Kris told the MET I wasn\u2019t a member of the university and that I was\nprobably \u2018one of those Jihadi Jon types\u2019 so they decided to send me to back to my\nhome country, which he told them was the Netherlands.\nHe left me a note:\n\u2018sorry mate, not actually sure who you are and they wont let me into the Union, I\nDiary Of A Fresher aged 18 3/4\ndon\u2019t think they know I work here, I had to make a judgement call. Hope it all goes well, I\u2019m\nactually quite jealous that you get to meet Peter Pan \u2013 lots of love and your welfare in mind\nK.Kraye\u2019\nThey sent me off in a cargo crate, the kind they use to ship livestock, I know this because\na shared my crate with a goat \u2013 fuck DPW\nTUESDAY 10th March\nI\u2019m still in the crate, not sure where I am but the goat seems to have gotten used to me,\nwell at least it\u2019s stopped trying to mate with me. I cried a little when I realised this was the\nmost action I\u2019ve received all year.\nIn lighter news, my bottom is feeling a lot better and I\u2019ve named the goat Dorothy to make\nme feel less lonely.\nWEDNESDAY 11th March\nDon\u2019t know how it happened but I woke up on a riverbank, specifically Dorothy trying to\neat my hair woke me up on a riverbank. I was so fucking confused because everyone was\nspeaking English and I could still see the Shard.\nPeople gave me looks when I took the tube with Dorothy but I felt bad letting her go.\nWhen I got back to my hall no one had noticed I was missing. At least I know why I was\non the Themes in the first place, apparently I was trying to find the salmon from a couple\nweeks ago \u2013 which makes sense, I\u2019ve dreamed about it most nights since.\nTHURSDAY 12th March\nDorothy wont leave me so I had to sneak her into the library, it was easy though because I\ntold security that she was my seeing eye goat and they believed me.\nSaw Kris there with Dorothy (the human one) there, I was skulking away when I called out\nfor my goat and human Dorothy turned. Kris hugged me hello and whispered something about\nsoft pizza bases in my ear.\nWe had a chat about how difficult it is to get a job, I don\u2019t know why I was talking to him,\nsomething about his uneasy smile seemed to calm me down.\nHeand Dorothy (the human one) sat really close to each other as we talked, I\u2019m not sure but\nI think he was touching her up \u2013 god I miss her. I tried to stroke my goat to get even but\nshe bit me quite badly.\nKris had to take me to A&E\nTurns out he was put in charge of my deportation - figures.\nOver the past 20th\ncentury\nthere have been few truly\ngreat political interviews:\nDavid Frost vs. Richard M. Nixon\nfor his betrayal of the American\npeople; George Sylvester Viereck\u2019s\nportrayal of Adolf Hitler, pre his\nrise to power; and now I, Monothan\nJasters, hope to be added to that list\nwith my in-depth-fly-on-the-wall-Gonzo-Journalism-self-proclaimed\nmasterpiece interview with the leader\nof the newly formed, and now most\npopular political party: Chris Kaye.\nChris stormed to victory as leader\nof the Welfare party earlier this\nweek, in a result that exceeded all\nexpectations. The Welfare party was\nformed by Kaye shortly before he\nleft Imperial College Union, after his\nseventeenth consecutive sabbatical\nyear.\nThe Welfare party, although\nright-wing in nature, is primarily\nconcerned with healthy pizza bases,\ndecreasing sanitary product prices\nand more photos of the Queen\npresent in public spaces.\nI am invited to interview him at\nhis apartment in Chelsea, featuring,\nan art-deco (whatever that means)\ndesign, and reportedly costing over\n$5,000,000 due to the success of his\naudiobook of a popular erotic novel\nthat has just been made into a film.\nI step out of the red velvet lined\nelevator to be greeted by his door,\nadorned with a large oddly phallic\nbrass doorknocker with the initials\nC.K.\nJust as I lean in with both hands\nto use the knocker in order to alert\nhim to my presence, he appears at\nthe door. As the door swings open, a\ngaggle of giggling women spill out,\nand Chris waves to them as they leave.\nHe then spots me hanging awkwardly\nin the corridor. \u201cHello mate, sorry\nabout that, my mid-morning \u201cplans\u201d\noverran!\u201d He then proceeds to laugh\nat his own innuendo, flapping his\nhands mid-air before gesturing for\nme to come inside.\nI proceed into his apartment: the\nmost striking furnishing in the room\nis that of a 6 foot marble statue of the\nman himself, again with the heavy\nemphasis on the phallus. He notices\nmy wandering gaze, and laughs again.\n\u201cWould you believe me if I said that\nit was based on a plaster cast? It cost\nme nothing to get made as Vivian\nWestwood said she was just happy\nenough to see it!\u201d\nI try and splutter out some sort of\nresponse to such a statement, but\nbefore I know it he\u2019s pressed a glass\nof whiskey into one hand and a cigar\ninto the other.\nWe proceed into his living room\narea where he invites me to sit on\na stool, which is a heavily detailed\nreplica of his face \u2013 assumedly\na trophy of his strong campaign\nagainst Cameron for the re-legalization of face-sitting in the UK\nporn industry.\nI start the conversation asking\nabout his plans now he is Prime\nMinster; what does he plan to turn\nhis attention to first?\n\u201cI\u2019m actually glad you asked me\nthat. Every month I plan to donate a\nthird of my sperm to the local sperm\nbank \u2013 I think such genes like mine\nshould not be limited to my current\nplethora of lovers. Everyone should\nbe able to have a part of Kaye.\u201d\nHe then goes onto talk about the\nsuccesses he has had this year: \u201cIn the\nrecent OBE award announcements,\nthey have taken Rolf Harris\u2019 one and\ngiven it to me for my work in the\ntampon industry.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the talk of a possible\nknighthood as king of the tampons,\nbut that is just a rumour the Daily\nMail spread.\u201d\nI ask him about his relationship\nwith the media: his own reports\nregularly state he contributes to the\nmedia where appropriate, but what\nexactly does that entail?\n\u201cWell,\u201d he begins, before leaning\nin, \u201cI have somewhat of a symbiotic\nrelationship with the press; they\nmake me a cult phenomenon, and\nin return, I feed them gossip about\nthe opposing party. They love it, and\nprint whatever lies they think are the\nfunniest.\u201d\nHe sits back in his chair, before\nwinking at this now nervous reporter.\n\u201cThe media has made me what I\nam today, and for that, I am always\ngrateful.\u201d\nHangman interviews the leader of the Welfare party\nAfter his surprise ascension to\nthe post, the \u2018joke\u2019 candidate\nin this year\u2019s Big Elections\nhas turned out to be \u201cthe most\nsuccessful Union President ever.\u201d\nThis claim has been reflected in\nstudent satisfaction surveys, with\nthe new President achieving record\nlevels of popularity.\n57% of respondees to the survey\n(commissioned and carried out by\nthe President himself) said they\nthought the President was \u201calright\u201d,\nwhile a further 22% agreed that he\nwas \u201ca total lad\u201d.\nRumours that the survey was\nconfined exclusively to a sports\nclub mailing list are yet to be\nsubstantiated.\nDespite this apparent success, it\nhas taken sometime to reach this\npoint. Following on from their\nshock election, beating out the then-favourite for the title, the candidate\nhad what one observer called \u201can\ninauspicious start\u201d by turning up\nfive hours late for the job, having\nspent the previous night \u201con the\nlash.\u201d\nHowever, their actions since then\nhave proven highly popular.\nThe first policy to be successfully\nrolled out across campus was 70\npence pints in all Union bars, a\nTroll candidate becomes \u201cBest President\never\u201d\npolicy for which the candidate had\ncome under intense scrutiny for\ntheir perceived lack of financial\nacumen.\nAfter an initial drop in income, all\nbars are now reporting dramatically\nincreased profits as a direct result of\nincreased attendance.\n\u201c568\u2019s been full every night of the\nweek,\u201d said one anonymous member\nof bar staff. \u201cWe had to start\nwatering down the alcohol to avoid\nrunning out, but then the president\nfound out so he fired all of the bar\nmanagers and had them replaced\nwith members of the rugby team.\u201d\nThe new managerial staff have\nsince re-rebranded CSP Wednesdays\nas \u201cSports Night\u201d, and imposed a\ntiered entry fee system based on\n\u201chow fit\u201d attendees are.\n\u201cWe always hear how we can\u2019t\nscrap entry fees,\u201d one manager said,\n\u201cso I thought why not make the most\nof it, and let all the fit birds in for\nfree?\u201d\nThe new President\u2019s policies have\nalso extended beyond the realm\nof the bars, with his enforced\nintroduction of a Page 3 to Felix to\n\u201cmake up for those pussies at the Sun\nnot printing tits anymore\u201d leading\nto record levels of readership for the\nnewspaper.\nJust before Hangman went to\nprint, another new policy (now\nofficially renamed \u201cPresidential\nEdicts\u201d) was announced: all mailing\nlists are now exclusively \u201cfor banter\u201d.\nA small team of volunteers will be\nappointed to monitor all electronic\ncommunications, with strict\n(alcoholic) fines for all those whose\n\u201cchat\u201d is deemed to be lacking.\nWith such an unprecedented level\nof success in just a few days, it looks\nto be a very exciting year for the\nUnion Presidency.\n\n"

Therefore, it\nseems that he is an incongruous\nchoice for director of Sophocles\u2019\nAntigone, a classic that so clearly\nrevolves around ideas of \u2018right\u2019 and\n\u2018wrong\u2019. This fact, combined with the\nreputation van Hove has obtained\nfor his radical reinterpretations of\nthe stalwarts of the theatrical canon,\nmeans that those attending the\nBarbican\u2019s production of Antigone\n\u2013 somewhat of a misnomer; this is\nin fact an international production,\nwith input from French, British,\nLuxembourgian, and Dutch\ncompanies \u2013 are already expecting\nsomething out of the ordinary.\nCombine this with the fact that the\nlead role is being taken on by French\nactor Juliette Binoche, a legend of\narthouse cinema who has starred in\nfilms by Jean-Luc Godard, Krzysztof\nKieslowski, and Michael Haneke, and\nthe hype surrounding the production\nreaches fever pitch. Of course, this\nis only the latest in what seems to\nbe a new trend of established actors\ntaking on some of Greek theatre\u2019s\nmost challenging women; after\nKristin Scott Thomas\u2019 turn in the Old\nVic\u2019s Electra, and Helen McCrory\u2019s\ninterpretation of woman scorned\nin the National Theatre\u2019s Medea, it\nseemed that Binoche had a lot to live\nup to. This production of Antigone\ndoes not disappoint, although the\neffect of van Hove\u2019s direction is\ndisconcerting; it hits all the right\nnotes, but plays an atonal tune.\nIt is Canadian playwright Anne\nCarson who has taken on the\nchallenge of translating the original\nGreek text, updating it for a more\nmodern audience. A high drama,\nAntigone centres around the daughter\nof Oedipus; cursed by birthright, with\na family \u201cdouble triple degraded and\ndirty in every direction\u201d, Antigone\nhas had a life of misery and shame\n\u2013 her mother\u2019s granddaughter, and\nher father\u2019s sister, Antigone has\nseen her two brothers kill each other\nin battle over control of the city-state of Thebes. The void left has\nbeen filled by her uncle Kreon, who\nattempts to establish some kind of\norder in the war-torn city through\nautocratic rule. His first edict: to bury\nEteocles, the defender of Thebes, and\nto leave Polyneikes, who launched\nthe war, out in the desert, unburied\nand unmourned. Defying her uncle,\nheadstrong Antigone buries the body,\nand is therefore condemned to death.\nAt first sight this seems to be a\nstraight-cut tale of a tyrant opposed\nto humanity, but Carson\u2019s translation\nhelps reintroduce the ambiguity at\nthe heart of the play \u2013 the interaction\nbetween physis, or natural laws,\nand nomos, those laws made by\nman. Antigone bluntly refuses to\nacknowledge these new laws \u2013 \u201cyou\ncall that law... Zeus does not/Justice\ndoes not.\u201d Binoche says these lines,\nnot with venom, but with a simple\nclarity \u2013 consigned to her fate, all\nshe can do is shrug her shoulders.\nAnd yet, Antigone is far from a\nsympathetic figure; as unrelenting\nas Kreon, she goes towards her death\nlike a reckless teen. When her sister\nIsmene (Kirsty Bushell) tries to share\nthe responsibility for the burial,\nAntigone screams at her \u201cleave my\ndeath alone/you did not lay a hand\non this/you cannot make it yours/\nfor me to die is altogether adequate\u201d,\nto which Ismene can only reply \u201cI\u2019ll\nbe so lonely\u201d. Antigone also seems\nto exhibit Freud\u2019s Death Drive, as\nshe rushes headlong into the abyss;\nfantasising about her coming doom,\nshe envisions the tomb as a bridal\nchamber where she shall \u2018marry\u2019 her\nbrother - \u201cone day we\u2019ll lie together\nin the grave he and I side by side/for\ndeath is long\u201d.\nAntigone is above all a complex\ncharacter, exhibiting both a\nchallengingly unendearing nature\nand an understandable motive for\nher actions; Binoche excels, with a\nmeasured, nuanced performance.\nA particular highlight of the\ntranslation is the skill with which\nCarson has handled the stichomythia,\nor alternating single lines. As\nAntigone argues with Kreon, the\nrhythm of these lines help create an\natmosphere of high tension, driving\nforward the drama; not only that, but\nthey give a chance for Antigone, that\nideal of a headstrong heroine, to show\nher cutting wit: \u201cone man rule has\nits advantages doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she says;\n\u201cyou\u2019re the only person in Thebes\nwho sees things this way\u201d, he replies;\n\u201cno actually they all do/but you\u2019ve\nnailed their tongues to the floor.\u201d\nSuch well measured, economical verse\nis a highlight in what is an excellent\ninterpretation of the original text,\nsomething for which Carson should\nbe applauded.\nFor those audience members\nexpecting emotional crescendos and\npummeling pathos, prepare to be let\ndown. van Hove makes the radical\ndecision to have the characters speak\ntheir lines in calm, even tones; it robs\nthe text of its urgency, but somehow\nworks, conjuring up an atmosphere of\nunease reflecting the moral quandary\nat the heart of the play. It is as if\nsomeone has sucked the oxygen out\nof the room, leaving behind a vacuum\nthat can only be filled with our\nundivided attention. Patrick O\u2019Kane\nis especially good in the role of\nKreon, imbuing his tyrant-king with\ninsecurity and a coldness that only\nbreaks towards the end of the play,\nwhen his actions have brought about\nthe destruction of his clan. I believe\nthat had van Hove made the decision\nto play Antigone straight it would\nhave become just another in a long\nline of Greek tragedies, or \u2013 worse \u2013 a\nhammy melodrama.\nWhat also sets this production\napart is the lack of that most\ncharacteristic of features: a chorus.\nInstead of having the traditional\ngroup of elderly Greek men, van\nHove lets each actor in turn take on\nsome of the lines spoken, resulting\nin a democratic version of Antigone,\nin which one character blurs into\nanother. The effect is startling, and\nit is only when reading the script\nthat one realises who is supposed\nto be saying what. This decision, to\nsplit up what is traditionally seen as\nsome form of conscious, reflects the\ninsecurity that lies at the heart of all\nof the characters.\nThat being said, there are some\nmoments of the play that simply\ndon\u2019t work: the lines of the guard, for\nexample, are delivered in such a way\nas to try and conjure up a humour\nthat just doesn\u2019t sit right within the\nproduction; the fact that the actors\u2019\nvoices are so levelled means that\nmany have to be mic\u2019ed up, which\ncompletely alters the quality of\nsound, and means that the rustling of\nclothing is amplified to an annoying\ndegree. The effect of such things\nis to take us out of the moment,\nreplacing pathos with bathos, and\nreminding us that we are \u2013 after all \u2013\nan audience in a theatre. The reason\nthat Greek drama has continued to\nbe meaningful is that it connects\nwith people throughout history; these\ndecisions by van Hove make it all the\nmore difficult to establish this fateful\nconnection.\nSuch dramas lend themselves well\nto minimalist staging, and Antigone\nis no exception: a vast blank space,\nwith a grave-like depression in the\nmiddle, and a blank circle at the back.\nAt the beginning of the production,\nthis circle moves back, revealing a\nvast round sun; as the play goes on\nthe circle slowly revolves round,\nsuggesting a single continuous series\nof events. This, combined with the\nmusic, which is largely minimalist\norgan drones, means that we are less\nin the ancient palace of Kreon than\nin a Philip Glass opera. It definitely\nworks, allowing all the attention to\nbe focussed on the actors. However,\nsome unwelcome additions intrude\non the minimalist setting; black sofas,\ntypewriters, and shelves of video\ncassettes conjure up the atmosphere\nof a modern office, something that\nseems completely incongruous to\nthe ethos of the play. The back of the\nstage is used as a vast screen, on which\nvarious scenes are projected: desert\nlandscapes, blurred city scenes, and\nAntigone\u2019s lifeless body. It wouldn\u2019t\nbe a van Hove production without\nsome kind of modern technology, but\n\u2013 bar one point at the end of the play\n\u2013 it never intrudes on the action.\nIf this production of Antigone is\nremembered for one thing it will\nnot be for Juliette Binoche\u2019s sterling\nperformance, nor Ivo van Hove\u2019s\nradical interpretation, but for the\nstunning new translation from\nAnne Carson, who handles the text\nwith delicacy and wit. This play is\nurgent; it quietly demands to be seen,\nstealing your attention for the entire\n100-minute run. A different take\non a classic, van Hove\u2019s production\nis disquietingly enjoyable, and\nunnervingly excellent.\nAntigone is on at the Barbican\nCentre until 28th\nMarch. Tickets\nfrom \u00a316; Young Barbican tickets\navailable.\n\"It is as if\nsomeone has\nsucked the\noxygen out\nof the room,\nleaving a\nvacuum\"\n\"Binoche\nexcels as\nAntigone,\nwith a\nmeasured,\nnuanced\nperformance\nof a complex\ncharacter\"\n\"Cursed by\nbirthright,\nAntigone has\nhad a life of\nmisery and\nshame.\"\n\"... it hits all\nthe right\nnotes, but\nplays an\natonal tune\"\nObi Abili, Juliette Binoche, and Patrick O\u2019Kane (From Left to Right) in Ivo van Hove\u2019s Antigone.

His\nroommate has been moved to another\nroom elsewhere in the hall for the\ntime being.\nGeorg, who was from Berlin,\nGermany, was a Computing\nstudent, and was running to be the\nDepartment of Computing Society\n(DoCSoc) Webmaster.\nAn email informing Computing\nstudents of his death was sent\non Monday. Professor Susan\nEisenbach, Head of the Department\nof Computing, said: \u201cGeorg was\nan excellent student who played\na proactive part in our student\ncommunity.\n\u201cIn addition to his outstanding\ngrades, he enjoyed participating in\nHackathons, and was running for\nWebmaster of DoCSoc. As a well-liked and enthusiastic member of our\ncommunity he will be sorely missed.\nOur thoughts and deepest sympathies\nare with Georg\u2019s family and friends\u201d.\nGeorg\u2019s campaign website included\nhis manifesto, which displayed his\nenthusiasm for the role and for\nImperial in general. \u201cOne of the\ncoolest things of coming to Imperial\nis the sheer number of events that\nare run by DoCSoc \u2026 consequently, I\ndecided that I wanted to contribute\nto this superduperawesome society as\nbeing Webmaster\u201d.\nHe was also an active member\nof Cross Country Society, and the\nGerman society.\nMemorials were held for Georg,\nfirst on Monday in his hall for\nstudents, and on Wednesday in the\ncomputing department, where a\nnon-denominational service and\ntributes from both staff and students\nwere given. Those gathered were also\nable to sign a Book of Remembrance,\nwhich Professor Eisenbach plans to\ntake to Georg\u2019s funeral back in Berlin.\nNicolas Prettejohn, the current\nDoCSoc webmaster, second year\nrepresentative for Computing and\nfriend of Georg, read out an eulogy at\nthe memorial on Wednesday.\nNicolas spoke to those present\nabout Georg\u2019s passion for his subject,\nhow he enjoyed getting involved\nwith departmental activities and\nhow he was \u201calways cheerful, smiling\nbroadly and enthusiastic to make new\nfriends. He took every opportunity to\ntouch the lives of students across the\ndepartment.\n\u201cGeorg took great pleasure in being\ninvolved and I see that as a testimony\nto his character: He wasn\u2019t content\nwith sitting on the sidelines. That\nwasn\u2019t Georg\u201d.\nNicolas also spoke about how Georg\nwas hardworking; he was a regular\nresident in the computing labs over\nthe weekend, and had an insatiable\nappetite for his subject. Nicolas\ncontinued: \u201cNot only did he work\nincredibly hard, there was always an\nawesome project or an exciting article\nto tell me about\u201d.\nGeorg loved the companionship of\nhis classmates too. \u201cThe way he saw it,\nwe were all in this together\u201d.\nNicolas concluded by saying how\nmuch Georg will be missed. \u201cGeorg\u2019s\npassing leaves a hole in the lives of\nhis family, his friends, his classmates,\nand the department.\n\u201cGiven time we will begin to heal.\nCoursework will still be submitted\nand exams will still be sat. Studying\nhere was Georg\u2019s dream.\n\u201cAnd as long as we remember Georg\nhe will live his dream through us\u201d.\nCollege in mourning after first year\nstudent passes away\nGeorg was my roommate,but\nmore than that,he was my friend.\nHe was a brother to me and I loved\nhim; he had an infectious passion\nfor his subject,for his friends,and\nfor everything in-between.\nI know so many people who grow\nto resent their roommates within a\ncouple of weeks,but within a couple\nof days I knew that Georg and I were\ncompatible,and that only grew\nfrom there.\nWe had a healthy sense of passive\naggression towards each other\nwhen either one of us irritated\nthe other one,and he never failed\nto make me laugh; albeit not\nalways intentionally.He had a\nvery dry sense of humour,often\nsaying things about efficiency and\ncomplaining about English systems\n\u2013he was also always smiling and\nmany people that didn't even know\nhim personally knew his face and\nhis enthusiasm towards everything.\nHe was renowned on our floor\nof halls for making strange food,\nespecially his daily sandwiches:\nthese consisted of peanut butter,\nbacon,salad,and tomato sauce.\nHe made these consistently on the\nsame day at the same time,so if\nyou could smell bacon late in the\nevening,you knew it was round\nabout 11pm.Whenever he was\nquestioned about these sandwiches\nhe was adamant that it was normal\nin Germany,justifying how they\nwere the most calorie efficient.\nAfter talking to his family recently\nI have a) found out that this is not\nnormal in Germany and b) that\nGeorg always made weird food.\nHe was one of the most\nauthentic people I have ever\nmet,always giving his honest\nopinion,regardless of anyone\nelse's problems with what he said.\nHe enjoyed his subject more than\nanyone I have met and he would\noften talk to me enthusiastically\nabout something that I had no clue\nabout,but he would discuss it with\nme regardless.\nThe last words I ever said to him\nwere\"Good morning\",and the\nhonest truth is that ever since I've\nwoken up without him in the room,\nthe phrase hasn't been true when I\nsay it.My heart is broken and I will\nnever stop missing him.\nJONATHAN MASTERS\n\u201cHe never\nfailed to make\nme laugh ...

Towards\nthe end of the meeting before the\nvoting was cast, a student asked\nwhether reversing the Union Council\ndecision would mean the College\nwould now agree to keep Weeks open.\nUnion President Tom Wheeler\nresponded, \u201cI would like to say yes\u2026\u201d.\nHowever, during a meeting between\nFelix and Professor Debra Humphris,\nVice Provost (Education), when we\nasked if College would keep Weeks\nopen if Union Council wanted them\nto, she did not give an answer.\nStatements on the College website\ndid confirm that the Provost board\nhas agreed to let Pembridge Hall\nremain open, a decision made in line\nwith the wishes of Union Council.\nThey stated that Pembridge Hall\nwould remain open for \u201cthe next\nthree years at least\u201d.\nThe Provost Board has also\ncommissioned a \u201cfeasibility study\u201d\nto establish a future use for the north\nside of Princes Gardens, including\nWeeks hall.\nHowever, College is yet to address\nhow the closure of Weeks will\naffect the average rent price that\nwas already agreed upon by Union\nCouncil.\nAt the last Union Council meeting,\nrent matrices were presented to the\nCouncil by College outlining average\nrent prices per hall, including the\nrelatively cheaper Weeks Hall and the\nnew student accommodation based\nin Acton.\nMany students were under the\nimpression that because Weeks\nfeatured in these price matrices,\nit would remain open for the next\nacademic year. When Felix had\npreviously enquired as to when\nWeeks was closing, College could not\ngive an answer.\nAlthough the matrices had\ndifferent prices for different halls, the\naverage cost of a bedroom per person,\nper week, remained at \u00a3166 for each\nvariation of rent prices Council was\nasked to choose between.\nUnion Council agreed to a rent\nmatrix that allowed the price of\nWoodward to drop to \u00a3120, but\nmeant halls nearer to campus would\nsee their rent rise as a result.\nCouncil has agreed to ask College to delay the closure of Weeks Hall Photo: Neville Miles\nIf Weeks is to close next year, the\nmatrices Union Council voted on are\ntherefore false, as they had included\nthe prices of rooms in Weeks.\nHumphris said earlier this week,\nbefore the Union Council meeting\ntook place: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to\nprovide the very best residential\nexperience to our students but we\nalso have difficult decisions to make\nabout the best use of our facilities and\nresources, both now and in the future.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t always got it right\nin the past but we are absolutely\ncommitted to partnering with\nstudents where we can to make these\ndecisions\u201d.\nShe said that when it comes to\nconsultation with the students it is\nnot always possible, but was adamant\nthat College still works closely with\nstudents, citing the opportunity\nstudents had to vote on the new rents\nmatrices (despite these now being\nincorrect).\nSaid Humphris: \u201cThat [was] a great\nstep forward in partnership working\nbetween the College and Union, and\nit\u2019s thanks to the real leadership\nshown by ICU President Tom\nWheeler\u201d.\n\n"

It\nwas a slightly more adventurous\ndestination than our usual Sunday\ndaywalks to the South Downs.\nWe set off for the drive down to\nDover to get the ferry, with a slight\ndetour around Trafalgar Square due\nto \u2018questionable\u2019 navigational skills\u2026\nArriving at the ferry port we went\nthrough passport control and after\na long delay finally got on the ferry.\nWe set off towards France leaving the\nwhite cliffs of Dover behind us for\nthe journey across the channel. An\nhour and a half later, we were driving\noff the ferry into Calais (thankfully\nremembering to drive on the right\nside of the road) and drove down the\ncoast for 30 mins to get to our walk\ndestination.\nWe were going to be walking in the\n\u2018Les Deux Caps\u2019 national park, which\noffers beautiful coastal walking,\nforests and rolling hills. We drove\nto the town of Boulogne-Sur-Mer\nto start our walk, which is a fishing\ntown. After finding some extremely\ndodgy minibus parking we set off in\nbeautiful French sunshine!\nThe first part of the walk turned\nout to be ever so slightly less beautiful\nthan expected, with the GR (main\nhiking trail) taking us through what\nwas termed a \u2018post-apocalyptic\u2019\nindustrial fishing harbour. Not to\nbe put off, we deemed it a \u2018cultural\nexperience\u2019 and carried on. The next\npart of the trail took us through\nbrambles, an abandoned train track\nand a concrete beach. More culture.\nWe always try to make sure people\nhave experiences they wouldn\u2019t\nnormally enjoy\u2026\nThankfully the walk then improved\nexponentially, and within 10 minutes\nwe were walking along the cliff with\nbeautiful views of the sea to our\nright, green hills to our left and lots\nof sun! We stopped for lunch with a\ngreat view, taking advantage of the\nlovely weather. We then carried on\nfollowing a narrow trail which took us\nfurther down the coast.\nAfter passing through a small\nvillage we emerged onto a beautiful\nexpanse of beach that seemed to\nstretch on forever. With the bright\nsunshine it almost felt warm enough\nto go for a swim! (Almost...) From\nhere we walked through some sand\ndunes and into a forest with a small\nfootbridge over a river.\nAfter following the path through\nthe forest for a while we then began\nto head back to Boulogne via some\ntracks through big green fields. We\ngot a great view of a viaduct to our\nright and the sea to our left. We then\ncontinued back into the town in the\nearly evening sunshine and walked\nalong the harbour-front promenade\nback to the minibuses.\nAfter an all-important wine and\ncheese stop in a supermarket we set\noff back to Calais to get the ferry\nhome with an amazing sunset sky\nover the sea to the left. The colours\nwere really spectacular!\nArriving at the ferry port we\nexperienced the most disappointing\ncaf\u00e9 ever (it was literally a vending\nmachine) before boarding the ferry.\nA few people managed to get a bit of\nsleep as by this point we had all been\nawake for over 16 hours! We got back\nto the Union just after 11pm, all very\ntired but very happy with the day.\nHopefully we\u2019ll all be able to go again\nnext year!\nGospel Choir make national final\nNdidi Iwumene on the teams at University Gospel Choir of the Year\nSinging in the rain\nPicturethis\u2026You\u2019reonthefifthfloorofthe\nlibrary.It\u2019sgettinghotinhere,butyou\u2019ve\nalreadytakenoffalmostallclothes.Throat\nparchedyougotofillyourwaterbottle,but\nthenearestisatLondonBridge.Youhaveno\nmoneyonyou\u2013becauseyouspentitallon\nsportsnight.Theonlyoptionistotrekthe10-milejourneytakingover3hours.\nThismaysoundhighlyimprobable,yet\nthisisthedailychallengefacedbymany\npeoplelivinginTabora,asmallcommunity\ninTanzania.TheclimateofTaborameans\npitifulannualrainfall,andwaterscarcityis\noneofthegreatestproblemsfacedbythelocal\ncommunity.\nOverthepast6yearsRaincatcherImperial,a\nstudent-ledcharity,havefocusedouractivities\ninthearea.Workingintimatelywiththelocal\nnon-governmentalorganisationCaritas,\nwebuildrainwater-harvestingsystemsand\nprovideessentialwaterandsanitationtraining\nforcommunities.\nEachyear,2tripsaremadeconsistentwith\nachievingtheaimsoftheorganisation.An\ninitial2-weeksurveyingtripatthebeginning\noftheEasterholidaysgathersvitalinformation\naboutresources,needsandcapacitiesofthe\narea\u2019stownsandvillages.Followedupbyan\n8-weekstayinsummerduringwhichrainwater\ntanksarebuiltandatargetedcommunity\ncapacityprogrammeisundertaken.Weplacea\ngreatdealofemphasisonsustainability\u2013local\nmaterialsareused,localskillsareacquired,\nandlocalpeoplearehighlyinvolved.\nThispastsummer,webuilta50,000L\nrainwaterharvestingtankataschoolinthe\nvillageTumbi.Alsoatthisschoolwetaught\n700studentsthe\u201cRaincatchersong\u201d.The\nmessageofthesongisclear,translatedfrom\nSwahiliitreads;\n\u201cEveryonelikesgoodwater;especiallywhen\nyouseehowcleanitis;Cleanwaterwillprotect\nyou;Itwillprotectyoufromillnesses.\u201d\nBeforetravellingtoTabora,weorganise\nfundraisingeventsandapplyforgrants\nthroughouttheacademicyeartofacilitate\nourwork.Workprovidingfundamental\nnecessities,likehelping700studentswho\narenowprovidedwithcleanwaterand\nunderstandthisimportantsanitationissue.\nThisyear,ourannualfundraisingeventis\n\u2018WaterWalk\u2019,heldonthe22nd\nofMarch,in\nconjunctionwithUNWorldWaterDay.The\nthemeforthisyear\u2019sWorldWaterDayiswater\nandsustainabledevelopment\u2013theethos\nbehindRaincatcherImperial.Participants\nwillgetatasteforwhatthedailywater\ncollectiontrekfeelslike.Carrying10liters\nofwater,10milesacrosscentralLondon.All\nourfundraisingeventsareopentoall,soget\ninvolvedwithyourfriends,family,neighbours\nandpets!Walkforwater,volunteerforwater.\nFollowRaincatcherImperialonFacebooktofind\noutmoreabout#WorldWaterDay,#WaterWalk\nandourupcomingevents.Letusknowwhatis\nwatertoyoubyusinghashtag#Wateris.\nQUEENIE TSE\nC&S WRITER\nImperial College Gospel Choir\n(ICGC) have done it again! For\nthe fourth time they\u2019ve made it\nto the finals of University Gospel\nChoir of the year (UGCY), the UK\u2019s\nbiggest inter-university competition\nshowcasing the very best of the\nstudent gospel music scene.\nThere isn\u2019t a more lively\ncompetition to attend, forget the\n\u201cPitch Perfect Competition\u201d! If the\namazing vocals, uplifting songs and\nvivacious choreo don\u2019t get you up on\nyour feet dancing then surely nothing\ncan! This year marks the 5th\nyear of\nthe UGCY annual competition, which\naims to bring together talented and\ndiverse individuals from 8 different\nUniversities. On March 14th\n2015\nroughly 1000 supporters will gather\nin the Hippodrome (Golders Green,\nLondon) to watch over 250 students,\nfeatured in 8 dazzling performances,\nbattle it out to be crowned the UK\u2019s\nbest university gospel choir.\nMOBO award winner Rachael Kerr\nwill be hosting the show, and she\u2019ll\nbe joined by Gospel music gurus and\nreturning judges Andrea Encinas,\nMark De-Lisser and Stephanie\nOyerinde. This year, new judge John\nFisher will also be joining the panel.\nThe returning champions, Revival\nGospel Choir from the University of\nNottingham is a strong contender\nand is largest of the choirs taking\npart. They routinely perform to\naudiences of more than 400 people\nand their winning performance last\nyear gave viewers \u201cgoosebumps\u201d. But\nfear not, it definitely won\u2019t be a one-choir show. The calibre of the other\nUniversity choirs is quite remarkable.\nTake Coventry Gospel Rhythms\nfor instance; not only were they\ncrowned runners up in 2014 they\nalso competed in the BBC\u2019s Song of\nPraise: Gospel choir of the year, last\nSeptember. But we also can\u2019t forget\nhow talented Leicester University\nVoices is; they first appeared in\nUGCY in 2013 and blew the audience\naway with an original and theatrical\nperformance. De Monfort University\nStudent Choir are the new kids on the\nblock being only six months old, so\nthey\u2019ve done exceptionally well to get\nto the final. Could they be the dark\nhorse?\nIt\u2019s difficult to say when Queen\nMary University Unite Choir could\neasily steal the show. They\u2019re a small\nbut mighty bunch who two years ago\nperformed in the first ever Gospel\nProms. Surrey University Gospel\nChoir returns this year for the third\ntime in even greater numbers, they\u2019re\ndefinitely one to watch. That leaves\nKingston University Gospel Choir,\nwho being a relatively new choir are\nUGCY finalists for the first time.\nThey are unique in the sense that\ntheir performances compromise\nmore than singing, they are also a\nperforming arts society so expect\nthem to certainly diversify the show.\nThe biggest question that remains\nis\u2026 what has Imperial got to offer?\nWell, ICGC was established 8 years\nago and is still going strong today.\nThis year the choir is smaller in\nnumbers but the quality of singers\nis undeniably higher than ever\nbefore. Their most recent Christmas\nshow The Night Christ Was Born\nwas testament to this and their\nperformances in Imperial\u2019s biggest\ncultural shows: Afrogala and East\nRaincatcher Imperial . Photo: Creative Commons\nMeets West have left audiences\nroaring with cheers. ICGC stands a\ngreat chance of claiming the trophy\nthis year, especially considering the\ncreative arrangement and dynamics\nof the six-minute medley they will\nshowcase on the night. If they were to\nwin the title it would be an incredible\nachievement for such a gifted group.\nImperial life is indisputably fast-paced and crammed with coursework,\nexams and lab reports (though\ngeologists would probably disagree)\nso winning such a prestigious music\naward would prove Imperial students\ndo have other interests outside\nCentral Library. All jokes aside\nthough, the show is promised to be\nunforgettable.\nC&S Editorial:\nAll Change!\nBEN HOWITT\nSECTION EDITOR\nWe\u2019re now a way past the\u2018weeks of weeks\u2019that\nhappened in the early part of this term.RAG\nweek (both IC and ICSM) were huge successes;\nArtsfest saw its biggest attendance ever; Student\nVolunteering Week plastered everyone and anyone\nwith handwritten postcards to say thank you...the\nlist goes on.\nThis week we\u2019re hearing from Ellie Johnstone\nagain,this time about The Fellwanderers\u2019day trip to\nFrance\u2013only slightly more successful than the RAG\nJailbreak.\nAfter that we have the incredible Gospel Choir,who\nhave reached the national final of University Gospel\nChoir of the year.If you can\u2019t make the date but are\ndying to see ICGC perform,keep March 17th\nfree\nand attend their Easter Show in Metric!

Members of the research\nfaculty across campus have been sending in letters in droves thanking\nus for our efforts to move interfering students further away from the vital\nwork being done on our South Kensington campus.\nNow that the initial excitment of the announcement is over, we must\nturn our eyes to face the realities of acquiring this new campus. With the\nmajority of students soon to be based at IVW (as we here in the Building\nhave taken to calling it), life around South Kensington is going to become\nmuch quieter. We hope this will prove conducive to staff morale, and\nallow us to continue to pursue the high standards all of us at Imperial\nstrive to achieve.\nThe new campus also has the added bonus of being located extremely\nclose to the internationally-famous Heathrow airport, making it our most\naccessible campus ever for all of our beloved international students.\nThis will allow us to expand our international intake several times over,\ncreating a larger student community who can support one another, as\nwell as cementing our reputation as a leader in the field of diversity and\ntrue multi-nationalism.\nIn unrelated news, the brilliant boys in the Finance Department have\nissued a new set of forecasts for our upcoming revenue streams, and\nthey\u2019re looking decidedly positive. To celebrate, we\u2019ll be providing a\nsmall treat to reward everyone for all of their hard work \u2013 keep your eyes\npeeled over the next week for your complimentary doughnut!\nWith our financial future secure, our gaze now turns to how best to\ncontinue our unprecendented expansion.

Perhaps it feels\nmore like honouring the monetary\nvalue of the work than its impact,\nbut Inventing Impressionism at\nthe National Gallery shows how\nfocussing on the collector can\nsometimes be a stroke of genius. The\nexhibition showcases the work of\nRenoir, Monet, and Degas amongst\nothers through the life of Paul\nDurand-Ruel, a French art collector\nwho is credited with championing\nthe work of the Impressionists when\ncontemporary reviews were mostly\nhostile.\nWe are introduced to the man\nhimself at the opening room of the\nexhibition in a simulacrum of his\ndrawing room. Displayed around a\nlarge black and white photograph of\nhis drawing room are the paintings\nthat hung there: Renoir, Monet,\nCassat; a Rodin sculpture sits on\nthe mantelpiece; a few chandeliers\nand Louis XIV chairs are thrown in\nfor good measure. Presiding over it\nall is a likeness of Durand-Ruel by\nRenoir, whose rendering is unusually\nsubdued, made up entirely in a palette\nof umbers and burnt siennas. A door\nwith inlaid panels is also exhibited\n\u2013 made remarkable by the fact that\nthey were decorated by Monet with\nsmall paintings of chrysanthemums\nand apples. Durand-Ruel wanted to\nshow clients that they could display\nart in the unlikeliest of places.\nThrough the exhibition the image\nof Paul Durand-Ruel emerges\nnot so much as the inventor of\nImpressionism, but as the inventor of\nthe modern art world we know today.\nAs a proto-modern art dealer he\nthrew lavish parties, bought paintings\nfor many times the average annual\nwage of a Frenchman of the time, and\nsometimes bought back the paintings\nthat he thought had sold for too low\na price. He was a shrewd business\nman; when the paintings by the \u2018new\npainters\u2019 didn\u2019t sell in his galleries,\nhe invited clients to his home to see\nhow stunning the paintings would\nlook in a domestic setting. He set out\nto conquer international territory\ntoo; with the Paris and London scenes\nexhausted, he exhibited paintings in\nAmerica, which saw the popularity\nand the fortune of Monet grow.\nDurand-Ruel made his fortune\nselling paintings by the more\nestablished Courbet and Delacroix\nand well as works from the Barbizon\nschool such as those of CharlesFran\u00e7ois Daubigny. Duabigny\u2019s\ntechnique of painting outdoors\nhad led him to make Monet\u2019s\nacquaintance; it was through Monet\nthat Durand-Ruel met Pissarro.\nThe works of all three painters are\nexhibited alongside each other\nwhich highlights not only Durand\nRuel\u2019s journey as a collector, but\nthe progression of the artists and\ntheir influences as well. Monet and\nPissarro continued Daubigny\u2019s\nexploration into painting out of doors\nand would finish their paintings en\nplein air instead of back at the studio.\nDurand-Ruel\u2019s taste for the more\nmodern is clear in earlier finds as\nwell. Gustav\u2019s Courbet Woman in\nWaves shows the goddess Venus rising\nfrom the surf, reminiscent of so many\nof the earlier mythological works,\nbut here he includes the model\u2019s\nunderarm hair, directly subverting\nthe idea of femininity in his depiction\nof beauty personified. Durand-Ruel\nis rumoured to have paid a record\nprice for this work, saying that this\nsort of work was far more to his taste\nthan the academic pieces that he was\naccustomed to collecting. Subversion\nand the beginning of modern art\nare a continuing theme throughout\nthe sixty plus pieces on show. Degas\nprovides customary humour in his\npaintings, focusing on the balding\nheads of the audience as opposed to\nthe scene being played out on stage in\nThe Ballet Scene, or on a disinterested\nteacher reading the paper rather than\nthe dancers in The Ballet Class.\nThe exhibition also seeks to\nhighlight just how modern the\nImpressionists were; while the\npainters of previous generations\nused naturalistic colours and tiny\nbrushstrokes blended together, the\npieces of Renoir and Monet show\njust how liberated painting became.\nInstead of adopting muted shades,\neven the white dresses Renoir paints\nare alive with technicolour hues,\nlemon yellows, and cobalt blues. The\nbrushstrokes are similarly vivacious \u2013\nvisceral daubs rather than layers and\nlayers of gossamer fine renderings\nof colour. Even the subject matter is\nmodern. Setting aside the previous\ngenerations\u2019 fondness for staged\nportraiture, mythological or biblical\nscenes, we are presented with scenes\nof contemporary suburbs, city life;\nMonet\u2019s loose brushwork in his\nnumerous paintings that depict the\nThames echo the veil like fog that\npermeated the city at the time.\nThe Impressionists were the first\nto reflect the world they saw around\nthemselves back at the viewer,\nheightened and resplendent in\ncolour \u2013 a celebration of the ordinary.\nMonet\u2019s ginormous depiction of\ngolden brown pastries in The Galettes\nis enough to hearten any foodie\nInstagrammer \u2013 if it\u2019s good enough\nfor him, it\u2019s probably good enough for\nus. It is through these artists that we\nwere first offered a glimpse into the\nmodern world. Monet\u2019s Green Park is\nfurnished with stick like figures oddly\nreminiscent of L S Lowry\u2019s scenes of\nurban Manchester.\nIn some of the pieces we also see\nthe beginnings of abstract painting.\nIn Alfred Sisley\u2019s The Flood, vertical\nlines of a submerged tree and a\ntelegraph pole are reflected in\nthe flood waters, which meld into\nthe same hued sky. For me, the\nundisputed star of the exhibition is\nthe Poplars series by Monet. Monet\npainted 24 canvases of poplars in\ndiffering lights and seasons; here\nsix have been reunited from across\nthe world for the first time in many\ndecades. The exhibition is worth the\nadmission price for these alone. The\ntrees pierce the canvas dead straight,\ntearing through the backdrop of sky\nand cloud; foliage swirls around the\ntrunks like a gymnast\u2019s ribbon. The\nbrushstrokes echo their movement in\nbroad sweeps.\nInventing Impressionism is\nsomething of a blockbuster for\nthe National Gallery. In bringing\ntogether so many big names, it creates\na primer on Impressionism and the\ngreat art of the late 19th\ncentury.\nAlthough staged around DurandRuel, it is the art that unquestionably\ntakescentre stage. Impressionism\nhas become such a staple of our art\nhistory that we can be desensitized\nto its power; Inventing Impressionism\nis the perfect antidote. If you go to\njust one exhibition this year, make it\nthis one.\nInventing Impressionism is on at The\nNational Gallery, until 31st\nMay.

It is interesting then, that\nShaw\u2019s ambitious work is successful\nas a comedy \u2013 the audience was\nfrequently in hysterics. The humour\nis always witty and intelligent, and\nnever distracts us from the deeper\nreflections; instead it underlines the\nabsurdities of society, marriage, life.\nThe play fully grapples with such\nbig issues as the characters engage in\nlengthy debate. Indeed, our hero\u2019s\nverbosity is the butt of the final\npunchline, but the weight of his\ndiscourse refuses to be forgotten.\nThese torrents of words, a man\u2019s\nsincere attempt to find meaning\nin life, become spellbinding and\ndeeply personal in the hands of\nRalph Fiennes, who plays the part\nwith complete conviction. At the\nheight of his philosophising he turns\nto the audience, his eyes red with\nemotion, and we have no choice but\nto empathise with him for, like him,\nwe realise that we too seek answers\nto these questions. This powerful\nsequence, set in a hellish dream, gives\nway again to the plot whose sunny\nscenes at the poolside are now left\nwith a sense of emptiness.\nPerhaps this is the difficulty of\nthe philosophical comedy, but as\nthe remaining acts progress they\ndo create their own significance.\nThis is thanks in large part to the\nperformance of Indira Varma as\nthe heroine Ann \u2013 both a symbol of\nfeminist emancipation and a danger\nto the freedom of men. Her character\nis endlessly intriguing and enigmatic,\nand her marriage to Fiennes\u2019 Tanner\nis revealed as the inevitable direction\nthe plot must take. For Tanner to\nreverse his position on marriage so\nsuddenly (having already heard a\nmultitude of his revolutionary tirades\non the subject) without a hint of\ncontrivance we require formidable\nacting and direction, and that is what\nwe get.\nIndeed, the entire cast is formidable\nand their comedic timing is perfect; I\nparticularly enjoyed Tim McMullan\u2019s\nperformance in the role of Mendoza\nand the Devil \u2013 the antagonist to\nFiennes\u2019 philosophical searching\nand the comedic centrepiece (the\nbickering between his anarchist\nand social democrat friends was\nparticularly funny). Only the\nworking-London accent of Straker\nand Hector Malone\u2019s American felt\nslightly forced and unnatural.\nThe scenery, designed by\nChristopher Oram, with videos by\nLuke Halls, is beautifully vague while\nstill providing necessary context;\ndreamy backdrops of moving\nclouds or hell-fire surround a more\nconcrete set of props. These props are\nunobtrusive and do not distract from\nthe drama, but add a comic touch\nnow and then \u2013 such as the elevator\nbetween heaven and hell. If, like me,\nyou enjoy theatre that is deep and\nthought-provoking, then this is a\nmust-see play.\nMan and Superman is on at the\nNational Theatre until 15th\nMay.

However, I often find\nthat, because audiences approach\nperformances of well-known pieces\nwith a great deal of knowledge,\nexpectations are inevitably higher\nand this all too commonly results in\nthe anticlimactic results.\nFortunately I did not feel it was\nthe result with this performance, a\ndifficult piece tackled with tact and\nrespect. I must however admit at\nthis point that I am not a great fan\nof either piece performed in this\nconcert and this may have very well\nbiased my opinion of their rendition;\nI find Carmina Burana, written in the\nmid-1930s, somewhat falls short of\nits attempt to evoke the style and\nspirit of the mediaeval poetry it is\nbased on, and I feel Chilcott\u2019s work is\ntoo clich\u00e9, a \u2018pleasant\u2019 piece (not used\nas a positive term) that has no real\nbackbone to it.\nHaving said that, I was looking\nforward to what the choir was able to\nmake of these pieces, whether they\nwere able to rid me of my pessimism\nand convince me that the works\ndeserve all the attention they receive.\nTheir cause was not helped by the\nchoice of venue, the Great Hall, with\nits truly dreadful acoustics, and the\nfact the house lights were not lowered\nduring the performance, meaning an\natmosphere was not really created\nthat was conducive to enjoying the\nrich musical textures created by\nthe choir. How is it possible to truly\ntransport listeners to an 11th\ncentury\nBavarian monastery when you are\nmade acutely aware of your less than\nholy surroundings?\nWe started off with Chilcott\u2019s\nhomage to the bustle of London\u2019s\nstreet markets with help from a\nwonderful children\u2019s choir from the\nSt. Marylebone C.E. School. I honestly\nfind it very difficult to review student\nproductions. Do I hold them to\nprofessional standards or to a kind\nof \u2018student\u2019 standard that takes into\naccount the fact they are amateurs?\nAs a student production, it was\nexcellent, maybe not quite as good as\nthe phenomenal ICSO last week but\ncertainly one of the better ones I had\nseen. But yes, there were times when\nsingers did not come in perfectly on\ncue, did not have the vocal strength\nor were not cohesive enough: a\ngroup of one hundred individual\nsingers instead of an undulating\nauditory body full of intrigue and\nemotion. More could have also been\ndone to build excitement into the\npieces through the use of dramatic\ndynamics and the modulation of the\nspeed of the piece. However, when\nyou take the piece as a whole, it was\nhighly enjoyable, with particular\ncommendation to the dual pianists,\nwho kept the piece driving forward,\na central force in integrating all its\nparts.\nNext on to the main spectacle\nthat burst into life with \u2018O Fortuna\u2019,\nsupported by a fantastic percussion\nsection and of course the famous\ntimpani part. Although it could have\nbeen even louder, more epic and\nexpansive \u2013 though this may have\nbeen an issue with the acoustics \u2013 I\ncannot deny the looks of joy on my\nfellow audience members\u2019 faces.\nThis work also showcased three\nsuperb solo vocalists, baritone\nTimothy Connor, tenor Joseph\nDoody and finally the soprano Jenny\nStafford: highly talented musicians\nwho were able to manipulate their\nvoices like putty to evoke any\nemotion required, thoroughly\nconvincing in their roles. They\nbrought a more polished performance\nto the concert and, when paired with\nthe piano, were spectacular.\nIt was refreshing to see the real\npassion on the faces of the choir\nmembers and whilst there were\nmoments that were not as strong,\nsuch as faster sections where I found\nthe singers too preoccupied with\nenunciating the words as opposed\nto the quality of the sound they\nproduced, there were also moments\nof sheer brilliance, such as a long\nsustained note that persisted with me\nfor minutes after.\nIt is difficult to write an overall\nreview as the quality did occasionally\nfluctuate but the rousing finale did\nmean that I left the concert with a\ndefinite satisfaction with the evening.\nUndeniably there was a lot of skill on\nthat stage but perhaps just slightly\nmore rehearsal time would have\nelevated the performance to greater\nheights.\nBe sure to catch their upcoming\nperformance on 5th\nJune at St.\nStephen\u2019s Church where they will\nperform John Rutter\u2019s Magnificat\nand Berstein\u2019s Chichester Psalms.\nHopefully they will be as thrilling\nas in this performance, especially\nbeing in a slightly more atmospheric\nenvironment.\n\"A difficult\npiece\ntackled with\ntact and\nrespect.\"\n\"I cannot\ndeny the\nlooks of\njoy on\nmy fellow\naudience\nmembers\u2019\nfaces.\"\n\n"

But with some fantastic fresher\nintake it has been one of the team\u2019s\nmost successful seasons in a long\ntime.\nAfter a short teething period, the\nteam have managed to pull out an\noutstanding performance, time\nand time again. The 1st have now\nbeen unbeaten in both their LUSL\nand BUCS leagues since the 5th of\nNovember \u2013 this is an incredible 17\ngames on the trot UNBEATEN! The\nridiculous goal difference of 239 goals\nfrom 8 games in the LUSL league\nmust also be pointed out. This is just\ntestament to our equally brilliant\ndefending and attacking skills.\nIt also must be mentioned that the\n1st have already beaten the medics\nthis season in the LUSL cup semifinal - even with one of our key\nshooters missing. The team\u2019s real\nwarm-up to varsity will be the LUSL\ncup final against RVC 1st \u2013 finally\nsome decent competition for us.

The team proudly\nincludes fresh faces of IC netball,\nless experienced but nevertheless\ncommitted.\nWith the more experienced players\nfrom last year guiding the team,\ntrainings and games have never been\nmore fulfilling and fun-filled. As the\ngirls of IC fives sharpen their play\nthrough the LUSL games and various\nfriendlies, there has been increasing\nnumbers of wins as Varsity draws\nnear.\nThe last two games of the LUSL cup\nhave greatly boosted morale as IC\nfives beat University of Arts 30-13 in\na fast-paced game and came off with\na 16-5 victory against Roehampton\nCollege. Nothing scares the fifth team\nas we fight on. The few unfortunate\ninjuries and the few games lost to our\nopponents mean nothing compared\nto our unfazed determination to play\nour best at Varsity. Definitely coming\nback harder and stronger. Hold your\nbreath and be impressed.\nICSM 2s have had a fantastic year of\nnetball in both our BUCs and LUSL\nleagues. After a hard season last year\nwith a loss to IC at varsity, the 2s have\nfought back with a huge amount of\ndetermination and fighting spirit,\nand with some talented new additions\nthe 2s have gone from strength\nto strength this season, proving\nthemselves to be a formidable team.\nWe currently stand unbeaten in\nLUSL with a promotion already in\nthe bag, and lie 2nd in BUCs having\nvery narrowly missed out on a second\npromotion. The team is now hungry\nfor a victory at Varsity.\nOur defensive unit GD -Maddison\nGronager and GK- Eleanor Tindall,\nwill not be making it easy for IC, and\nwatch out for Elizabeth Dunne as\nshe makes some flying interceptions,\nsecuring turn overs that GA Megan\nThomas and GS Shade Oyewole will\ncertainly be capitalizing on.

Our\nfierce play and unbeatable shooting\nskills have led us to huge victories,\nincluding a 56-0 thrashing and see us\nset to finish at the top of LUSL.\nOur strong team bond, love of\nTaylor Swift and dedication to the\ngame means there is no doubt we will\nsmash varsity this year. Be scared\nIC, we\u2019re coming for you and look\nforward to watch you crumble\u2026\nHaving just missed out on a spot\nfor LUSL promotion, the 4s are ready\nto take on Varsity! Despite losing\nkey players at the start of the season,\nmotivation runs high and the 4s have\ncontinued to improve. I have every\nfaith that we will secure a victory\ncome Varsity having seen the growth\nof not only the players individually\nbut the team as a whole into a family\nof fun and enthusiastic girls who may\nlack in height, but are blessed with\nspeed and skill.\nAlthough defence will miss the\npresence of Nat Ilenkovan, IC will\nstill have a hard time evading our\ndefenders.

The development\nand sheer strength of this team is\nclearly evident in the incredible\nunbeaten run we sustained at the start\nof this season, the cracking score lines\nwe have produced and the occasional\nMonday circles we\u2019ve had to introduce\nbecause let\u2019s face it, such greatness\ndeserves celebration!\nWith the arrival of a few new\nplayers and the formation of a\nbeautiful new defensive partnership,\nin the unlikely event that IC find\nthemselves with possession of the ball,\nthey will be lucky to get any shots past\nthe arms of Millie Ahmed and Suki\nNahl. Our formidable centre court\nwill then be on hand to swiftly deliver\nthe ball back to our triad of shooters,\nwho with a LUSL goal difference of\n+156 this season need no introduction.\nHaving already annihilated IC\n4s 39-14 this season, ICSM 5s are\nconfident that we shall bring in\nthe first of many medic wins with\nnothing short of a landslide victory.\nBe warned IC, we shall not be using\nthe first quarter to warm up this year!\nSquad:\nSuki Nahl\nMillie Ahmed\nHanne Ertman\nIzzie Stopford\nSammy Sundar\nIfrah Hussain (C)\nLaura Tan\nTara Vasir\nNina Bowman\nAlex Compton\nAlice Lee\nNaoko Atsumi\nThe 1s this year have had an\nincredible season; marred only by\nthe time we played, and drew, with\nthe medics.

We will be bringing an element\nof surprise to the pitch!\nHas there been any specific\npreparation for this game in\naddition to normal training?\nYes, there have been additional\ntraining sessions for both teams with\nseparate coaches. This will ensure we\nare all on our A game at Stoop.\nHow much are you looking forward\nto playing at the Stoop?\nIt is a fantastic opportunity to play\nat the home of the Harlequins and we\nare all extremely excited about being\ngiven this opportunity.\nWhere will this game be won and\nlost?\nJe ne comprends pas\u2026\nPrediction for the game?\nWell I\u2019m not going to predict that\nwe are going to lose am I?\nAlice Liberman, College Captain\n\"Women's\nrugby has\ngone from\nstrength to\nstrength\nthis year.\"\nElisabeth Robinson, Medics Captain\n1.\nChambon\n2.\nPeruho\n3.\nGrant\n4.\nMobley\n5.\nLiberman (C)\n9.\nEdwards\n10.\nGago\n14.\nLakhani\n11.\nEllison\n15.\nSimpson\nPROVISIONAL\nLINE UP\nThe Rugby Showdown: Women\nHow has your season gone so far?\nIt\u2019s been a bumpy season truth\nbe told, having lost a lot of senior\nplayers at the end of last year we\ntook a slight knock to our winning\nstreaks. However we\u2019ve had a massive\nintake of very talented and promising\nfreshers who have showcased their\nskills well in matches. This has left us\nhigh in the London League.\nDoes playing against people you\nnormally play with add an edge to\nthe game?\nDefinitely. There\u2019s a good level of\nbanter between us and the other team,\nand I\u2019m sure knowing their players\u2019\nstrengths and weaknesses as well as\nour own will help us play strategically\nto our advantage.\nHas there been any specific\npreparation for this game in\naddition to normal training?\nThat would be telling\u2026 Yes\u2026 but the\nother team will probably read this so\nwe\u2019re giving nothing away.\nHow much are you looking forward\nto playing at the Stoop?\nSO SO MUCH! It\u2019s a big thing for us\nobviously, playing high level rugby\nat a famous ground is any young\nplayers dream. Even playing in front\nof a crowd will be exciting and a first\nfor most of our team. But on top of\nthis, for a women\u2019s sport to be the\nheadline act at varsity for the first\ntime is a huge step forward for sport\nat imperial. We\u2019re hoping watching\nour game will not only raise the\nprofile of women\u2019s rugby, but inspire\nmore women at Imperial to take part\nin sport!\nWhere will this game be won and\nlost?\nDefinitely rucks and Wings. IC has\na forward heavy team whereas we\nhave a higher proportion of backs.\nIn this 10s game our stamina will\nbe under scrutiny, so we will have to\nwork hard to continue clearing out\nthe rucks and making the crucial\nruns for the line.\nPrediction for the game?\nTricky, it\u2019s all to play for.

After\nan attempt to run a modification\nof last year\u2019s car was denied, rushed\nredesign is expected to leave the\nteam extremely uncompetitive as\nin previous seasons. Notably Force\nIndia almost missed the testing\naltogether; only to arrive half way\nthrough the third and final test as a\nresult of \u201ccash-flow issues\u201d that will\nlikely stunt the development process.\nThey do, however, still possess the\nMercedes engine which will at least\nmake them competitive in a straight\nline.\nFerrari appear to have made great\nstrides in the engine department\n\u2013 significantly closing the gap to\nMercedes whilst leaving Renault\nbehind. This was apparent after the\nfirst test in which Ferrari and Sauber\nregularly topped the time sheets\nalthough the subsequent tests suggest\nthat both still have some catching up\nto do to their main respective rivals.\nMcLaren\u2019s partnership with Honda,\nreunited after parting in 1992, has\nbeen cause for optimism amongst\nthe team although the on-track\nperformances are in stark contrast\nto this. The car did not appear\nparticularly competitive at any of\nthe tests whilst repeatedly breaking\ndown. A high speed crash that left\nFernando Alonso hospitalised during\nthe second test was also cause for\nconcern. The only glimmer of hope\nfor a good start to the season was the\n101 laps managed on the second day\nof the final test by Jenson Button,\nalthough it is highly likely that\neither car will see the chequered flag\nat the season opener.\nIn another season dominated by\nengine performance, the Renault\npowered cars of Red Bull and Toro\nRosso seem to be lagging behind the\nfield. Despite being one of the most\nattractive cars of 2015, the latest\noffering from Toro Rosso has been\nconsistently near the bottom of the\ntiming sheets. The story with the\nsister team, Red Bull, is not much\nbetter with any aerodynamic tricks,\nhidden by the exotic camouflage\npaint job sported throughout\ntesting, negated by the severely\nunderpowered engine. Comfort can\nbe taken from the fact that the power\nunit is significantly more reliable\nthis year than last.\nThe domination of Mercedes is\nHenry Lambley tells Felix what he is expecting after the winter testing period\nlikely to continue into the new\nseason with Mercedes powered cars\nvying for the top prizes.

Rather\nominously, the works Mercedes car\nlooks unbeatable in the hands of\nWorld Champion Lewis Hamilton\nand team mate Nico Rosberg. The\nreliability issues of last year seem to\nbe a thing of the past after managing\n578 laps in the first test at Jerez\nalone and consistently managing\nover 100 laps per day at the other\nevents. Although focussing on long\nrun performance and reliability, they\nstill managed to be a second per lap\nfaster than any other team.\n2015 looks set to be a rerun of last\nyears intra-team rivalry with the rest\nof the field fighting for best of the\nrest.\nMercedes look set to build on their dominance of last season Photo: Mercedes AMG Petronas\nHenry Lambley's predictions for this season's Constructor's Championship (right), versus the final results from last season (left)\nIC end Cross Country season raking in the silverware\nPhoto: IC Cross Country\nMatt Douthwaite reports on the culmination of the season in Bushy Park\nOn Wednesday 25th February\na 20 strong team of\nImperial athletes from the\nCross Country Club arrived at the\nstunning Bushy Park for the sixth\nand final London College League\nRace of the year. The stakes were\nhigh, with Chris Thomas and Alex\nMundell in with a shot at the Men\u2019s\nand Women\u2019s individual trophies\nrespectively, and the Men\u2019s First\nteam in hot contention with Brunel\nand King\u2019s for a spot in the top three.\nKnowing the best five of six races\ncounted, Imperial had responded\nwell for the final showdown,\nbringing 5 of those on the BUCS A\nTeam and reserves in the Men\u2019s and\ntwo in the Women\u2019s. In particular\nChris Olley was hoping to maintain\nhis 100% win record (albeit his first\nrace since October).\nThe race (8km for guys and 4km\nfor girls) was run around the edge\nof the park amongst the deer on\nvery flat paths for a cross country\nevent. This meant the start was\nblisteringly fast start with Olley,\nThomas and a lot of competition\nshooting down the opening straight\nat sub 5 min/mile pace. Such a fast\nrace is very tough test of mental\nstrength and experience in judging\nyour pace. Too fast at the start\nand you\u2019ll burn out, too slow and\nothers will get away from you. Most\ngenerally go for the former, with\na lot of grimacing faces spotted\ncoming past at the end of the first\nlap.\nThe high pace was maintained\nfor most the whole way round and\nSarah Johnson was first home for\nImperial placing 3rd in the Ladies\nRace, closely followed by Mundell in\n9th \u2013 both impressive performances\nfollowing the National XC\nChampionships and BUCS Indoors\nrespectively.

XC Champs, he\nlost out to a St. Mary\u2019s Drone to\nfinish 2nd. Meanwhile Thomas was\nnot far behind and finished 7th.\nAfter the race there was much\nbaking with some exceptional lent-breaking brownies to celebrate the\ngreat results and of course the team\nphoto. It was an emotional moment\nfor Matt Douthwaite, Cloudy\nCarnegie, James Ellis and Sophie\nRogers for whom it was their final\never LCL.\nAt the awards ceremony there\nwere some surprises in store. Not\nonly had Thomas managed to\ngrab 4th place in the Individual\nMen, but Mundell had become\nan unbelievable 1st out of all the\nWomen in the League. Both athletes\nhad committed to the league and it\nwas great to see this was rewarded.\nFinally it was announced that the\nImperial Men\u2019s team had managed\nto whoop Brunel in the final event\nand claimed 3rd overall behind UCL\nand St. Mary\u2019s (the latter don\u2019t really\ncount as they\u2019re evil robots, so this\nwas more like second)!\nThese brilliant results were highly\ncelebrated at the evening\u2019s bowling\nsocial, with many a celebratory\ndrink, some great and awful skills\nand a very competitive game of\noldies vs newbies.\nTop woman in the London League, Alex Mundell Photo: IC Cross Country\nSound like fun?

Now voting\nhas closed, we can now announce our\npredictions for who will be next year\u2019s\nsabbatical officers.\nOur poll, which was open from\nthe start of voting until Thursday\nevening, asked voters who their\nfirst choice preference was for the\npositions of President, the Deputy\nPresidents, and Felix Editor.\nThe number of votes cast has\nalready passed many of last year\u2019s\nmilestones. At time of print we had\nalready beaten the number of voters,\nalthough as there are more students\neligible to vote this year, we are yet to\nbeat last year\u2019s percentage of 39.31%.\nOn average, students can vote for\n33.6 positions, although 6 people\nhave 100 or more positions to cast\ntheir vote for. The most number of\npositions one poor student has to vote\nfor is 144.\nRespondents were asked what type\nof student they are, what gender they\nidentify as, what year of study they\nare in, what their fee status is, and\nwhat department they were from; so\nthe Felix analysis team could look for\npatterns and trends.\nUnlike the election itself, which\nmakes use of the Single Transferrable\nVote system, our poll only asked for\nvoter\u2019s first preference.\nAs it is possible for the person\nwho commanded the greatest share\nof the vote from first preferences\nto not win the election \u2013 this was\nseen (for example) last year in the\nelection for RCSU President \u2013 there\nis a possibility that the person we\nidentify as coming first place may\nnot actually win the election when\nsubsequent preferences are taken into\nconsideration.\nAdditionally, readers are warned\nthat this poll may not be completely\naccurate, as a result of the low number\nof responses (150), especially for\ncertain groups of students (namely\nthose in the RSM, and postgraduates),\nso we warn readers (and candidates)\nthat the results announced on\nFriday night may well differ to our\npredictions.\nOur predictions are as follows.\nFor the position of President, Luke\nArmitage was selected by 17% of\nrespondents, Lucinda Sandon-Allum\n59%, and RON at 24%, meaning we\npredict Lucinda to become next year\u2019s\nPresident. 118 people cast their choice\nfor this role.\nFor Deputy President (Finance and\nServices), Ali Lown took 22%, Lizzie\nCampbell 16%, Christopher Kaye\n53%, and RON 9%, 112 people made a\nchoice for this position.\nMeanwhile, for Deputy President\n(Welfare), Diba Esbati was chosen by\n21%, Jenny Watson 65%, and RON\n14%, with 107 responses. Therefore,\nwe expect Chris to be next year\u2019s\nDPFS, and Jenny the DPW.\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\nTwo positions which were\nuncontested were Deputy President\n(Education), where Chun-Yin\nSan commanded 70% of the 107\nresponses, and RON 30%; while for\nFelix Editor, Grace Rahman took 85%\nof the 111 responses and RON 15%.\nChun and Grace are expected to\nbe next year\u2019s DPW and Felix Editor\nrespectively.\nHowever, one of the most\ninteresting cases was Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies), where\nTom Rivlin took 29%, Ben Howitt\n47%, and Issy Barrett 15%, leaving\nRON with 10%.\nWhilst we expect Ben to be next\nyear\u2019s DPCS based on these results,\nwhether Tom wins on Friday night\nbased on second preferences could be\na possibility. 105 people cast a choice\nfor this position.\nAnalysis of our demographic\nreports showed some interesting\ntrends. For the position of Deputy\nPresident (Welfare), none of the\npeople who responded to our poll who\nare medics chose Diba Esbati \u2013 it is of\nnote that Jenny Watson is the current\nICSMSU Welfare Officer.\nMeanwhile, DPCS candidate\nTom Rivlin enjoyed much greater\npopularity from Natural Sciences\nstudents than those from other\nfaculties according to our poll (Rivlin\nis a Physics undergraduate).\nWhen looking at the gender\ndistribution, people who identified\nas female were far less likely to select\nLuke Armitage for President, but\nalso chose RON in slightly larger\nnumbers.\nLucinda Sandon-Allum was also\nchosen more often by female students\nthan male. Looking at DPCS, Issie\nBarrett took nearly double the\nnumber of choices from female\nstudents than male ones. Whilst this\nmay suggest that people vote along\ngender lines, further research would\nbe needed to confirm this possibility.\nPerhaps more interestingly, with\nDPFS, Chris Kaye\u2019s popularity\ndropped significantly with female\nvoters, while Ali Lown\u2019s increased.\nRON consistently performed better\nwith older students (bar one hiccup\nin the trend with DPW). Candidates\nwho bucked the trend included Tom\nRivlin (DPCS), Lizzie Campbell\n(DPFS), and Ali Lown (DPFS).\nFull demographic breakdowns\nwill be on the Felix website later on\nFriday 13th\nMarch, and the actual\nresults of the Big Elections 2015 will\nbe announced at the Union\u2019s results\nparty (Friday 13th, 8PM, Metric) and\nonline shortly afterwards.\nThe live stats on the Union page give a comprehensive breakdown of voters Photo: Imperial College Union\n\n"

Named from its ritual of the burning of a large\nwooden effigy, the festival is different in a sense that it does not have a single focus. Instead, it is guided by ten\nprinciples: radical inclusion, gifting, decommondiciation, radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal\neffort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation and immediacy.\nThe weeklong festival begins on the last Monday of August, and takes place in the middle of a large plaza at\nthe temporary city named Black Rock City by the participants. It is usually built a few weeks before the event\nby volunteers from the Department of Public Workers. A temple has become an addition to the burning man\n(historically up to 105 ft tall) since 2000, and various artworks are installed in the desert as well.

And while\nI don\u2019t pretend for a second to fully\nunderstand what is going on, I want\nto comment on the West\u2019s foreign\nalliances with Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia is the world\u2019s\ndominant oil exporter and the only\ncountry named after its ruling royal\nfamily, The House of Saud. It is one\nof the least democratic states in\nexistence and a place where women\nare prohibited from driving, voting\nor even leaving their house without a\nmale chaperone.\nThere are no jury trials in Saudi\nArabia, most trials are held in secret\nand courts observe few formalities.\nOrganizations such as Amnesty\nInternational and Human Rights\nWatch have condemned Saudi\nArabia\u2019s human rights record against\nwomen and ethic minorities and\ncriticised the severe punishments\nhanded out by the criminal justice\nsystem, which is based on a hardline\nand literal form of Shari\u2019ah law.\nThis oil-rich kingdom\u2019s brutality\nis reflected in the number of public\nexecutions that are carried out there.\nAccording to a report by Human\nRights Watch (HRW) the late\nAbdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud,\nformer King of Saudi Arabia, oversaw\nthe beheading of 87 individuals, by\nsword, in the last year alone.\nMany of those killed had\ncommitted non-violent crimes\nincluding drug smuggling, sodomy,\napostasy and even \u2018sorcery\u2019. The state\nhas also tortured and killed critical\njournalists.\nOne particular case in Saudi\nArabia has received a lot of media\nattention recently. Raif Badawi is a\nwriter, activist, blogger and Saudi\nnational who has openly criticised\nhis country\u2019s regime for several years.\nConvicted of the crime of \u2018insulting\nIslam\u2019, Badawi has been sentenced\nto 1000 lashes, ten years in prison\nand a fine. The first 50 lashes were\nadministered on 9th\nJanuary 2015. His\nwife, Ensaf Haidar, has said that Raif\nwill not survive the floggings.\nAnd all this is unlikely to change\nany time soon. After the death of\nKing Abdullah in January his half-brother, Salman, assumed the throne\nto become King and Prime Minister\nof Saudi Arabia. King Salman is not\nexpected to be a reformist in the\ncountry and has vowed to continue\nthe \u201ccorrect\u201d policy of his predecessor,\nstating that democracy \u201cshould not be\nimposed in Saudi Arabia\u201d.\nIn early February Prince Charles\nmet with King Salman during a six\nday tour of the Middle East, where\nthey \u201cexchanged cordial talks and\nreviewed bilateral relations\u201d between\nthe countries.\nTo be clear, this is our heir to the\nBritish monarchy meeting with\nthe leader of an Islamic state that\nsanctions the execution of prisoners\nby beheading with a sword in public.\nThis is simply barbaric. It is a\nmedieval, ultra-conservative system,\nunderpinned by the most extreme\ninterpretation of Islam, Wahhabism.\nJust days after King Abdullah\u2019s\ndeath, President Barack Obama\ntook a trip to Saudi Arabia to pay\nhis respects and cement ties with\nKing Salman. During the trip\nObama did not even raise the issue\nof the country\u2019s human rights\nabuses and backward attitudes to\ngender equality. A few days later\nthe president was in India giving\na speech urging the country to be\nmore progressive about women\u2019s\nrights. This kind of double standard\napproach to foreign relations on the\nworld stage is shameful.\nThat the British and American\ngovernments cosy up to the Saudis\nin full knowledge of the appalling\ncircumstances in which many of its\ncitizens endure is a disgrace that\nhas been criminally under reported\nBarack Obama met with King Salman to pay his respects to the former King and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud after his death in January Photo: itv\nJoshua Renken comments on the relationship between the West and\nSaudi Arabia\nfor years. That the UK and US do\nthis while lecturing other nations\nabout democracy and human rights\njust adds an extra layer of naked\nhypocrisy to the situation.\nSo why does this happen? Put\nsimply: oil, trade and political\nstability. Large and powerful\ncountries such as Saudi Arabia \u2013 the\nworld\u2019s petrol station \u2013 can get away\nwith atrocities that less influential\ncountries could not because of their\nglobal significance. That\u2019s the way\nthings seem to go. We saw it in the\nfailures of the League of Nations, we\nsee it now in the Middle East, and we\nwill regrettably see it in the future.\nThat said, I\u2019m not necessarily trying\nto pin the blame on \u2018evil\u2019 Western\nleaders. I get it. The alternative to\nupholding one\u2019s principles in all\ncircumstances is far messier. In the\ncurrent financial climate no one is\nprepared to let their economy take\na hit by imposing trade sanctions.\nMoney doesn\u2019t talk. It screams.\nSaudi Arabia is the largest and\nmost important producer in the\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC), the bloc that\ncontrols almost half of the world\u2019s\noil. The UK does not buy oil from\nthe Saudis, but Saudi Arabia is the\nUK\u2019s primary trading partner in the\nMiddle East and our largest arms\nbuyer, with joint ventures between\nBritish and Saudi companies worth\ntens of billions of pounds each year.\nThe US however imports hundreds of\nthousands of barrels of oil from Saudi\nArabia every day.\nSince the UK would never make\nmeaningful strides to address the\nrepulsive Saudi Arabian government\nwithout agreement from the US \u2013\nwho are not prepared to see a spike\nin oil import prices \u2013 there will be no\nbold action from either country.\nCountries such as Saudi Arabia are\nconsidered criminal governments one\nminute and trading partners the next,\nwhich makes Western governments\nguilty by tacit consent. It is insincere\nforeign policy that leads me to\nwonder, \u201cOh oil, is there nothing you\ncan\u2019t do?\u201d. Our ongoing relationship\nwith this vile government\ndemonstrates that economic interests\ndictate principles. It proves that we\nare only as morally upstanding as our\nnational wallet will allow, and right\nnow our international relations are\nabounding with hypocrisy.\nI just look forward to the day where\nthe UK, US and other democratic\nnations no longer need to trade\nor buy oil from countries such as\nSaudi Arabia, so that we can find the\nbackbone to stand up to the heads of\nterror states and severe all ties with\nthese thugs. That moment can\u2019t come\nsoon enough.\n\n"

You\nget on with your life and it seems\nthat the people around you do too.\nHowever, you don\u2019t have to dig very\ndeep to find that many students are\nstruggling. It can be very difficult to\nknow if a friend is struggling with\ntheir mental health.\nThis year, myself and a group\nof other students have started\nMentality, a campaign focussed on\nimproving the state of mental health\nat Imperial through challenging\nstigma, raising awareness, improving\nservices and helping to guide students\nto the help they need.\nSince forming Mentality, I have\nbecome acutely aware of mental\nhealth at Imperial. I am now so much\nmore aware of the size of the problem\nand I have heard countless stories,\nsome good and some bad, about\nhow students have been treated by\ncollege when they have been in times\nof greatest need. Any of you who are\nfans of the Facebook page \u2018Imperial\nCollege Secrets\u2019 will know what I\u2019m\ntalking about because between the\ncomedic anecdotes and, frankly\nbizarre, stories, you will have seen the\ndesperate pleas for help of those who\nhave nowhere else to turn.\nHaving experienced depression\nmyself, I know the fear of admitting\nto others that you\u2019re not doing\nwell. You blame yourself for being\ndepressed and criticise yourself for\nbeing too weak to make yourself\nbetter. Unfortunately, having a\nmental health condition skews your\nview of the world, rational thoughts\nare dismissed and the irrational takes\nover; it seems you are alone, that\nnobody cares.\nIt is incredibly hard to see the truth.\nDepression or any other mental\nhealth condition are illnesses just like\nany other and like any other illness;\nyou require treatment and help to get\nbetter.\nThis feeling of isolation is why\nI decided to create Mentality. No\none should have to go through\nwhat I suffered. No one deserves to\ngo through a mental illness alone.\nWhat they do deserve is compassion\nand understanding. This is what\nMentality is for, above all else. We\nexist because we care about you and\nI\u2019m not just saying that, we really do.\nWe are here as your peers and your\nequals and we will help you to find\nyourself again.\nTo be able to provide the most\neffective support we need to know\nmore about the average student\nexperience at Imperial. To do this we\nare running a survey. The outcome of\nour survey will also determine what\nwe choose to campaign about; we\nwant to tackle the pressing issues that\naffect the most students. This could\nbe access to services but it could also\nPhoto: Imperial College Union\ntake the form of changing student\nopinion if we find that there is a\nrecurring reason why students don\u2019t\nseek help. Furthermore, we want to\ngauge what students know about the\nwelfare services already in place at\nImperial. You may never have had a\nmental health condition, and I hope\nyou never do, but if things did start\nto go wrong, would you know who to\nturn to?\nI hope this article has made you\nthink more about mental health, of\nthe problems that exist and also of\nyour own mental health.

A team at\nImperial\u2019s Department of Chemistry\nhave done just this. Working with\nthe spin-off company, Econic\nTechnologies, they have developed\na cleaner way to produce valuable\nmaterials from waste carbon dioxide\nand are bringing it to the market.\nSince the 1960s there has been\nmuch research into ways of\nconverting carbon dioxide into a\nsuitable chemical intermediate.\nFreely available, with low toxicity\nas well as being an environmental\nnightmare, this molecule lends itself\nto this type of research. However,\ndeveloping catalysts and processes\nto convert carbon dioxide has been\nproblematic. Mainly because this\nhighly oxidised state of carbon is at\nthe lowest energy state of all carbon\ncontaining C1 species, meaning that\na huge amount of energy is needed to\nreduce it.\nHowever, there has been progress,\nwith the development of catalysts\nto successfully incorporate carbon\ndioxide into polymers. These\npolymers can later by used in\npolyols, which are used to make\npolyurethanes, a material found\nin tonnes of consumer and\nindustrial products, including\nSpandex! However, at the moment,\nindustrial processes for producing\nthese valuable polyols requires\npetrochemicals such as the toxic,\nexpensive and energy inefficient\npropylene oxide.\nPrevious cleaner methods that have\nbeen developed to produce polyols\nusing carbon dioxide have been\nfound to work only with high purity\ncarbon dioxide. Despite being a step\nin the right direction, this process is\nnot practical as one of the principle\napplications of this technology is to\nclean up real sources of waste carbon\ndioxide.\nExperiments by Imperial\u2019s team\nof researchers were conducted using\ncarbon dioxide from Ferrybridge\nPower Station carbon capture\ndemonstrator plant in West\nYorkshire. The results published in\nACS Catalysis this February indicate\nthat by using the novel catalyst\ntechnology developed at Imperial,\nit was possible to use waste carbon\ndioxide to produce useful products\nsuch as polyurethanes at much\nlower pressures and temperatures\nthan previous methods. These\npolyurethanes can then be used to\nvaluable materials from furniture to\nthe soles of your trainers.\nThis method makes the process\nmore economically appealing to\nexisting polyurethane manufacturers,\noffering a cheaper and more\nenvironmentally friendly alternative\nto exclusive petrochemical usage.\nThe team has estimated that for\nevery tonne of carbon dioxide used,\ntwo tonnes of emissions could be\nsaved through circumventing the\nproduction of the petrochemical-based raw material it displaces.\nMany industries that emit large\nquantities of carbon dioxide are also\nlikely to be obliged to use carbon\ncapture and sequestration (CCS) in\nthe future with the introduction of\nenvironmental policies to reduce\nlevels of atmospheric greenhouse\ngas. CCS is a costly process, but using\ncarbon dioxide as a raw material\nto make polymer materials could\noffset these costs. \u201cUsing real\ncarbon dioxide emissions to make\nuseful products is very challenging,\nbecause frequently catalysts are not\ntolerant of minor contaminants,\u201d\nsaid Professor Charlotte Williams,\nlead author of the study. \u201cCarbon\ndioxide streams from power stations\nHumans still have an\nunmistakable tie to our\nape origins. The question\nis, how did we get from such a\nbeginning to our where we are\nnow? The fossil record provides a\nfragmented view of human evolution.\nFrom this record, the time of split\nbetween the Homo genus and\nAustralopithecus genus remains\nambiguous. Fossilised remains\nof Homo habilis mark the split\nbetween Homo and Australopithecus\ndating between 2.4 and 1.5 million\nyears ago (mya). However, with the\ncontinual advancement within\npalaeoanthropology we have recently\nseen the discovery of a lower jawbone\nand five teeth belonging to the Homo\nlinegage which dates to around 2.8\nmya. Disputes concerning whether\nthe fossilised remains of Homo\nhabilis specimens belong to the\nAustralopithecus genus and thus\nsplits in the latter lineage occurring at\na later date, are challenged.\nThe significance of the\nAustralopithecus-Homo divergence\nis owed to the transition of ape-like species to forms resembling\nmodern humans. Characteristics\nsuch as expansion of brains; body\nenlargement; decrease in the extent\nof sexual dimorphism in terms of\nbody size; tool usage; changes in\nare among the most contaminated\nsources of CO2\navailable, so the work\nwe have done is a big step forward\nbecause the catalysts show such\nremarkable tolerance and function in\nalmost exactly the same way as using\npure CO2\n.\u201d\nEconic Technologies was initially\nset up to commercialise the catalysts\ndeveloped by the team at Imperial.\nThe research has already attracted\nthe attention of major chemical\ncompanies to support the adoption\nof this more economically sound\nand environmentally friendly\ntechnology. The research was funded\nby the Government\u2019s Department of\nEnergy and Climate Change and the\nEngineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council and published on\nthe February 10, 2015.\nDOI: 10.1021/cs501798s\nlimb proportions; reduction of cheek\nteeth size and unique Homo features\nof the brain were derived. This\nnovel discovery in the Afar region\nof Ethiopia, the Ledi-Geraru areas\n250 miles from Addis Ababa, is of\nhigh importance. The fossil remains\nprovide clarification to a \u201c poorly\ndocumented hominin evolution,\u201d\nsays Erin N. DiMaggio, associate\nin the department of geosciences\nPenn State \u2013 especially within this\nimportant time frame between 3 and\n2.5 mya.\nA more definite age of the\nremains cannot be given due to\nthe absence of a direct method to\nascertain a date. Measuring different\nisotopes of argon can determine\nthe age of eruption producing the\nvolcanic ash or tuff preserving the\nsample. Thus, can imply the age of the\nsample. The age of the rocks above\nand below the sample are found to\nindicate the earliest and oldest dates\nfor the fossil. In addition, other\nfossilised organisms in the area at\nthe implied date are determined to\nreveal the environment in which\nthe hominin fossil once existed.\nPrehistoric antelope, hippopotamus,\nwater dependent grazers, elephants,\nand fish suggest that habitat was a\nmixture of grasslands and shrublands\nsome 2.8 mya. There has thus been\na definitive change in the climate\nin this region which could have\ntriggered the Australopithecus-Homo\nsplit.\nAlthough it is still too soon\nto say whether the climatic signal\nand change in climate triggered\nthe divergence between the Homo\nand the Australopithecs lineage;\nthe signal never-the-less acts as\nevidence supporting the proposed\nclimate hypothesis. One of the\nmany theories to explain explain the\nAustralopithecus-Homo split. These\nnovel fossilised remains provide a\nsignificant stepping-stone in our\nknowledge of human evolution.\nFerrybridge Powerstation, UK, where the experiments took place.\nPhoto: 3.aba.com\nThe discovery of this jawbone made fossil hunters get hot under the collar\nPhoto: Guardian\n\n"
