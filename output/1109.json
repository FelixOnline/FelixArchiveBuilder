Ever wondered whether somewhere in a lecture theatre in Budapest students were being similarly entertained?\nEver thought (cynically, privately or otherwise) that you could never change these things? Well then,\nBEST may be something for you!\nBEST (The Board of European Students of Technology) is a non-political, non-profit network of students from 21 different European countries. It was founded in 1989 with the aim of 'promoting Europe\namongst Europeans. Local BEST Groups (LBG) keep in contact via the Web.\nSummer Programme (as the courses have come to be known collectively) is just one of the events organised by BEST. Under the same terms you might attend a one week Short Intensive Training (SIT) in\nHelsinki on a non-technical topic such as management, marketing or presentation technique, or a one\nweek intensive language course in Krakow. You might also participate in a cultural exchange between\ntwo LBGs, each undertaking to outdo the other in intricacy of local custom, and no doubt, the ability to\nconsume obscene quantities of fermented hops! And if that's not enough then you can always go skiing\nin Tignes, mountaineering in the Alps or canoeing on the Rhine... Where's the catch? Although IChas in\nthe past been a part of the BEST network we have since lapsed into a state bordering dangerously on suspension because... well frankly... we haven't organised a single event for the past two year. There are\nnow a few of us who plan to resurrect BEST as an ICU Society. Naturally, as with all these things, we\nneed your support. Specifically, we need to make a list of at least twenty people who would be interested\nand are also looking to mobil i sea group of committed individuals to form our committee - a President,\nVice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Publicity Officer, Web Manager (very important) and an Industrial\nLiaison Manager. So, if this article has whet your appetite for more, if you really want to make an impact\nin the future of YOUR engineering/science education at a European level, if you want to travel and meet\npeople from many new countries... then please get in touch with us soon by e mailing\nd. pieter@ic.ac.uk.\nHAIR SALON\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington London SW7 3ES(1 Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nCUT& BLOW DRY\nBY OUR TOP STYLISTS \u00a3 1 5 LADIES\n\u00a3 1 3 MEN Normal Price \u00a330\nM fe Telephone 0171 823 8968\nACCESS VISA MASTERCARD CASH CHEQUES "

    "content": "NEWS 27 February 1998\nLondon Colleges Red Card for Football\nSnub NUS Strike\nANDREW OFORI\nThe University of London will be\nconspicuous by its absence during the NUS 'shut-down' on 4\nMarch. The event comes as the\nNUS campaign against tuition fees\nis reaching its culmination, with\ncurrent efforts being concentrated\non opposition to the Teaching and\nHigher Education Bill, which will\npave the way for the introduction\nof fees.\nThe NUS 'shut-down' event has\nreceived nation-wide backing with\n130 Further and Higher Education\ninstitutes closing down for the day.\nStudents are being encouraged to\ngo to their student unions rather\nthan attend academic sessions.\nHaving gained support from the\nAssociation of University Teachers\nand a significant number of lect ur ers, the NUS have stressed that no\nstudents should be academically\ndisadvantaged as a result of the\nstrike action.\nLondon students have\nexpressed the depth of their feeling\nagainst tuition fees in the past with\nevents such as the Hyde Park\ndemonstrations last November( Felix 1097 and 1100), but on 4\nMarch Goldsmiths College will be\nthe sole University of London par-tic i pant, and will only be giving partial support. The NUS are disappointed with London's response;\none union representative warned\n\"not supporting something like this\nis a big mistake\". A former London\nstudent who is currently a member\nof the parliamentary division of the\nNUS emphasised the \"onus is on\nthe choice of the student\" and\nwent on to explain \"this isn'ta new\nphenomenon for this campaign\", as\nLondon colleges regularly show a lack of support at these type of\nevents. He attributed this to a significant number of commuters making up the student population,\nconsequently reducing the importance of the unions in student life.\nHowever, ICU president Andy Heeps was more forthright in his\nreasoning for not taking part,\nasserting \"It's a case of shutting the\nstable door when the horse is\nhalfway down the field\".\nFourths\nJULIA HARRIES\nThe Imperial College Union\nFootball Club are to face a Union\nDisciplinary Committee next\nweek, after the Fourth team\ncaused trouble in Bath Union last\nWednesday.\nHaving lost their BUS A game,\nthe team went to the bar to drown\ntheir sorrows. According to Jo\nHumphrey, Assistant Bar Manager\nat Bath Union, they behaved in a \"drunken, rowdy manner\", jumping\non tables, shouting and swearing.\nWhen asked to calm down by the\nBar Supervisor they refused, and so\nwere cautioned by Sean Bentley,\nthe Assistant Bar Manager on duty\nat the time, who informed them\nthat they would not be served further at the bar. The team appeared\nto calm down, but when Mr Bentley's back was turned, they\nshouted and swore at him. Mr Bentley then obtained the help of\nthe Bath Sports President, Sarah\nMilne, in order to make them leave. At this point the students\nbecame even more abusive; one IC\nstudent on leaving was heard to\nprotest \"What kind of fucking union\nis this?\" Bath Union has contacted\nImperial College Union to inform\nthem of the trouble, and has\nadvised ICU not to let the team\ninto its bars. Mr Bentley commented that\" No respect was shown for\nthe bar, the staff or the University.\"\nThis incident is the latest in a line of similar occurrences. Andy\nHeeps, 1CU President, decided to\nbring the Fourth team before a Union Disciplinary Committee, as\nhe has been very lenient on previous occasions, a fact acknowledged by Donal Keene, the Football\nClub Captain. Mr Heeps observed\n\"It's getting a little tedious.\nHowever, I'm sure the Disciplinary\nCommittee will make a decision.\" It\nseems unlikely that the Fourth\nteam will be invited back to Bath,\nwith Ms Humphrey remarking \"they\nwon't be very welcome here.\"\nWaterstone's Fire 'Warning Shot'\nDAVID ROBERTS\nFears are growing that\nWaterstone's, who last year took\nover from the Union as sole\nbookshop on campus, may have\ngreater visions for their retail\nempire. Speaking at the first meeting of the Bookstore Users\nCommittee last week, Rachel\nDickinson, the manager of the\ncampus branch, outlined her desire\nto stock cards and stationery in\naddition to science texts and a wide range of fiction.\nDespite the fact that the contract for the site explicitly states\n\"The sale of other magazines,\nnewspapers, stationery, food....will\nnot be permitted\", Ms Dickinson\nexplained that \"This is something I, personally, would really like to see\nhappen\". Asked if expansion plans\nwere connected to rumours that\nthe campus branch was at present\n30% under budget, she admitted\n\"Yes, we are having problems, although that's not something I'd really like to see appear in Felix\".\nAndy He eps, IC Union\nPresident and sole student representative on the Users Committee,\nobjected very strongly to any proposals to expand sales to cover\ntio nery and so forth while the\nUnion Shop's still there\".\nCiting problems with opening\nhours and sub-branches of\nWaterstone's on the Charing Cross\nand Hammersmith campuses, Mr stationery \"Waterstone's know that's where we get our money\nfrom and they can sod off\". Ms Dickinson did accept that at present expansion plans were unlikely\nas \"We can't go selling cards, sta-Heeps observed \"We don't believe\nthat they are delivering on certain\npromises\". For example, the contract states that the hours of opening at South Ken should be \"9am to\n6pm, Monday to Friday... these are\nminimum times of opening\", which\nthe present shop fails to do. Worse\nstill, the Hammersmith shop has\nbeen closed on every occasion on\nwhich Union staff have visited the\nsite. Whilst sales of paper and stationery are prohibited at South Ken,\nthey are allowed at Hammersmith.\nHowever, a rapid spot check on\ndemonstrated prices to be between\n20 and 30% higher than at the ICU\nShop.\nSpeaking on behalf of the\nUnion, Mr Heeps added \"The problems which we raised when tendering for the bookshop are now starting to rear their heads\". However,\nthe President was confident that\nCollege would turn down Waterstone's request, viewing the\nissue more as \"a warning shot\", to\nwhich the Union should respond\n\"very firmly no\".\n\n"

    "content": "FICTION 27 February 1998\nFrom the author of Raising Demons, Caspar von Wrede, comes another dark tale from the edge.,\nHe can see the sky and it is the most beautiful\nthing he has ever seen, a vast dome of infinite\nblue. He can see the sun. It has gradually, imperceptibly, crept across the heaven. In the beginning he had to strain his eyes to the left as far as\nthey would go to see it and now he was beginning to have to strain them to the right. They\nache from the constant light but that doesn't bother him. The sun is still warm on his face,\neven though it must be getting late. He can't remember when it last shone but he imagines it\nwas a very long time ago; maybe he never\nnoticed it.\nSome clouds formed earlier on in the direction of where his feet must be. Long, thin tenuous clouds that appeared out of the air to drift\npeacefully away beyond where he could see\nthem. Sometimes a billow of smoke will pass\nover him and his world will briefly be cold with\nshadow. The smell of cordite will sting his nose\nand sometimes clods of mud will patter around\nhim. thrown up by the explosion. But then the\nsmoke passes and again the delicious sunlight\ncaresses him.\nHe can hear every shell as it shrieks earth-wards and each time he wonders again whether\none of them will end its brief, violent flight\nthrough the air on him. But none of them do. Some fall so far away that he can barely feel the\nmud around him shiver as they detonate. Others\nhit the ground only tens of feet away, tearing\ndeep wounds into the soil and showering him\nwith the fragments. Endlessly they fall from the\nblue sky, bearing their loads of destruction. But\nnever on him, not yet. He's glad that they don't. He is in no pain. He can watch the sky and the\nsun in its timeless orbit; maybe he will even see\nit set.\nHe must be losing blood. He cannot move\nanything apart from his eyes. He cannot feel his\nlegs. And his memory is gone. His mind is blank,\nwiped; he does not know his name or what has\nhappened to him. He just knows that he is lying\nhere in the mud, between bodies and craters,\nand long coils of barbed wire. Waiting.\nHe is living in the present. His past is gone,\nas is his future. There is just the timeless present,\nand he can feel that it is infinite.\nSomeone was close to him, very close. He\ncould hear their breathing, long and slow, as if\nthey were asleep. He would have been able to\ntouch them if he could have moved his arm. The\nbreathing was with him for a long time, very reg-u lar, somehow intimate. He listened to it and\nbreathed with them. But then the breathing had\nstopped, without warning, from one breath to\nthe next and he was alone. Further away someone had been saying a name. Franceses, over\nand over and over again. A normal voice. As if\nthey were mentioning the name in conversation,\nagain and again, no change in the tone or the\nspeed, like a record needle stuck in its groove.\nBut they too had stopped suddenly. A shell\nprobably got them. If he could speak would he\nbe saying someone's name? He might have a wife, children even, but he can't remember. He doesn't mind, it wouldn't change anything now.\nHe feels like he is part of the mud already.\nGradually it has been oozing into his tunic, cold\nand alien on his skin. But now he cannot feel it\nanymore, maybe his body temperature has\nwarmed it, or maybe he is too numb to feel it.\nThis mud will swallow him and maybe he will\nnever be recovered. There are so many others\nout here, each once a person, with a face that\nhad smiled and cursed and cried, who had\nbreathed and felt pain. Each had been loved.\nEach with a story to tell, but not anymore. He is\nalmost like them; he has forgotten his story.\nStrangely he does have one last memory\nthough, one lone recollection amongst the\nemptiness in his mind. It is the memory of a room.\nThe room is small, rectangular, and contains\nonly a sink, a bed, and a cupboard. The walls are\nmade of smooth wood, painted light yellow, and\nthere is a door opposite the bed. Another wall\nhas the sink, of white porcelain, attached to it.\nThere is a lamp hanging from the ceiling, with an\nopaque white shade. It has a wick that glistens\nwith oil and a long fluted chimney of glass. But\nbetter than this the room has a window. And through this window he can see a field of long\ngrass, and beyond it a flat body of water that\nstretches almost to the horizon. On the horizon\nare dark rolling hills and above them, the sky,\ndark blue and filled with towering stacks of white\ncloud. He does not know what is beyond the\ndoor. When he tries to open it there is only that\nemptiness that has swallowed the rest of his\nmemories.\nThis room must have meant something to\nhim, for its memory to survive whatever it was\nthat left him here bleeding into the mud. Or maybe it was just luck that he has one meaningless last recollection whilst everything else was\npurged. What happened in this room? He will\nnever know, but he can sav our its memory.\nSuddenly he can hear shouting. The gunfire\nseems to have increased. He can hear the whine\nof bullets as they cut the air overhead, briefly\nintruding into his world. A machine gun is firing\nsomewhere in quick bursts and its explosive\nchatter is making un remembered fears stir in his\nmind. There is a machine gun nest close to him.\nWas that what they were trying to take out?\nThere are screams and more shouting. And suddenly something flies through the air, thrown by\nan unseen hand, and lands beside him. Adrenaline erupts into his blood. Even though he\nsaw it for only a fraction of a second, he knows\nit is a hand grenade.\nDamn, Damn, Damn, why does the end\nhave to be like this? He tries futilely to move, to\ncrawl away. But his muscles are not responding,\nthey are betraying him. He doesn't want to die\nso soon. It is far too early. He should have been\nallowed more time than this. He stops trying to\nmove, and closes his eyes. Tears are streaming\nout from under his eyelids.\nHe forces himself to breathe slowly, to try to\norder the thoughts in his mind before it is permanently extinguished. Time slows down so that\nits passing is barely perceptible. Maybe his mind\nknows it is about to be vapor is ed, he thinks,\nmaybe it is slowing down his perception of time\nso that he can have a few more moments. Any\nsecond now...any second. His whole body is\nshaking. This anticipation is killing me, is the only\nthought in his mind. He would have laughed\ninsanely had he been able to do so.\nThe moments pass, and he is still alive. It's a dud, it's a bloody dud. For many minutes he\nlies with his eyes closed, maybe even for as long\nas half an hour. He cannot think but continues to\ncry silently.\nThen there is a new sensation, warmth\naround his breast, for the first time an ache. I'm bleeding, I must have opened a wound. He\nrealises that this time it really is the end. He\nfeverishly tries to think of his past, someone he\nknew, anything, but it is useless. There is no th ing. Sounds are becoming more distant, the sky\ndarker, but he realises that the darkness is only\nin his mind. He is dying.\nHe re-enters the room, searching for a memory that he might have missed but there is\nnothing new. He looks through the window scanning the glorious vista, but he's seen it all\nbefore. He turns round and suddenly there is a cot in the middle of the room, a simple wooden cot, painted white. It is occupied. Ever so slowly\nhe bends over and delicately moves a blanket so\nthat he can see into the child's face. With an\noverwhelming certainty he suddenly remembers\nthat he is a father, and that this is the child\nwhom he never saw, who was born after he\nbegan his service at the front. He is transfixed by\nits beauty, its innocence, its peacefulness, but he\ndares not touch it in case he wakes it. Very slowly he leans forward until his face is almost touching the child's curls. He can smell it's freshly\nwashed skin. Remember me, he whispers softly\ninto its ear. Then he straightens up, opens the\ndoor and without looking back steps into the\nyawning void.\nHis corpse is smiling.\n\n"

A lot of the tunes\nhave a 'recorded-on-a four-track-in-my-mates-garage' feel to them,\nbut this only serves to make the\ncompilation something you won't get sick of listening to.\nUnfortunately, as a lot of the songs\nare some of the bands' first mater-i al, it is a little dull so it's never\ngoing to be at the top of my stack.\nOne track that stands out miles\nabove the rest, is Building by The\nUnbelievable Truth - a band to\nwatch out for. It's a sort of REM style ballad with really strong\nvocals coming from Andy Yorke,\nbrother of Radiohead' s Thorn\nYorke. The Radiohead influence is\nevident, but the style is sufficiently\noriginal to set them apart so hopefully the inevitable comparisons in\nthe press won't drag them down. The other songs are mostly\ncredible, with stuff like Blah Na Na\nby Impossible Music Force and\nMagdalen Sky by Mark Gardener\nmaking the whole thing a very\npleasant listen. Mind you, I really\ncan't work out what's going on\nwith the DJ Remould and Spunkle\ntunes. They're a sort of cross\nbetween a very early Erasure demo and an episode of Teletubbies.\nThe material being promoted\nhere is all very worthy and it's the\nkind of album I'd be really happy\nabout owning if it came free on the\nfront cover of the NME. I'd say that\nit's definitely worth keeping track\nof future Shifty Disco releases for\nthe sort of gems that are hidden on\nthis CD. d William Smith\nAn opening raucous an the mic rant delivered at break-neck\nspeed is usually employed to\ntry to jump start some artists'\nalbums into action, disguising the\ninevitable dive into the much slower and less exhilarating numbers.\nThe Beekeepers do not employ this\ntactic. The album commences with\nthe comparatively quiet and personal Eyeballed, which happens to\nbe the only track written by lead\nsinger Jamie East. From there,\nwe're thrown into the aggression-fuelled and indie-fie d punk world\nthat is home to these guardians of\nhoney-makers.\nWith this short amount of\nmaterial, it's surprising to report\nthat bombshells feel like they're\nbeing dropped left, right and c en tre. Killer Cure chainsaws its way\ninto your mind with its mix of spiky\ngui tats and layered vocals. The\ninfectious Do You Behave Like That\nat Home? cuts itself into your sonic\nstomach and churns itself over and\nover. There's also Beau Peepshow,\nSecond Skin and Catgut to chew on\nfor dessert if you're still hungry for\nmore. However, if you feel like\nyou're going to get chronic punk\nindigestion, relief can be found\nslightly in / Only Want To See You;\nSuffer and Elsewhere to ease the\nrazor blade riffs and rampaging\nrants. There's also a comic bonus\ntrack at the end, which is outrageously ridiculous; I 'll just say that\nit tells the story of mice singing at\nthe Albert Hall!\nThird Party, Fear and Theft is a fantastically fiery album but the\nBeekeepers' turbulent sound is\nbest experienced live. It would be\nwise to try and catch them soon\nbefore they explode along with\naccompanying ticket prices.\nHowever, you could always get\nyourself a copy of the album now:\nfor insurance purposes, naturally El Dennis\nSINGLES Dust Junkys - What Time Is It?\nThe Dust Junkys sound like a cross between\nBlack Grape and Fun Loving Criminals on happy\npills. A funky, catchy, little summer tune.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON1 Mandalay - Flowers Bloom\nFor some strange reason the radio edit is\nremixed by Alex Reece. Reece destroys the brilliant lyrical composition of the original, featured\nas aB side, but adds not such a bad dark\nsounding tune. The original however is excellent\ndrum 'n' bass with float y female vocals.\nSenser - Breed\nSenser got rid of three out of their original line\nup of five and now it's Kerstin singing with the\ntune, crunching guitars, hip hop beats and\neffects sounding the same as ever. The rock rap\ncross over was fairly fresh four years ago when\nSenser were making all the right noises and\nheadlines. Unfortunately this will do neither for\nthem.\nRamzi\nKaren Ramirez - Distant Dreams CD Sampler\nOne thing - the girl can sing! Different styles\nover different production styles show she is\nadaptable but titles like Troubled Girl, Looking\nfor Love, If We Try, and Lies seem to indicate\nthe usual tried and tested subject matter but for\nmost people that isn'ta problem. Apart from\nthat, this is a promising start for her.\nLionrock - Rude Boy Rock\nThrow this on the decks, lay back and just relax\n... scarcely any vocals here ... just music, and it\nis all good for that. Just rock wit dem!On the\nflip, Best Foot Forward will satiate the hunger of\nthe dance crew and Push Button Cocktail is\nanother compelling track. Definitely worth get-ting.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON2 Bim Sherman - Earth People\nA refreshingly original song infused with the\ntabla sounds of Talvin Singh. The man's voice is\njust too good, and with his lyrics, make a brilliant track. The remix by Ronnie &. Clyde take it\ninto drum bass land, which turns out to be\nsurprisingly good! El\nRoni\n\n"

As I explained in my little\nintroductory piece last week, I 'll be\ngiving you a run down of what the\nstation is up to, with features on bands we've got in session and profiles of some of our top DJs.\nThis week I'm featuring James\nRatcliff, one of the stars of our\nFriday dance night, and \"one of the\nmost up for it people about\".\nThe music he plays is not easily\ncategorised. \"The roots definitely\nlie in American house but also with\neasy, fun, upfront tracks along the\nlines of Pushca. I don't play too\nhard, just accessible big party\nbeats.\" And his favourite tune at\nthe moment? \"There's one by\n'Voices of Life' by Steve Silk Hurley,\nthere's the original anthem mix that's got a wicked vocal and really\nwide bassline- everyone loves it.\nThere's also loads of good stuff\nbeing released by Subliminal,\nMousse T and Masters at Work that's worth checking out.\"\nJames Ratcliff started out when\nhe was 14, playing at his own par-ties. He sees DJing as a logical progression from his love of music.\nInspired by people such as C.J Macintosh, he has since progressed to playing in clubs ike the\nMinistry of Sound, Hanover Grand,\nAquarium and Cafe de Paris.\nWorking alongside DJs such as\nJudge Jules and the Ministry resident Mark Wilkinson, he's built up\nquite a following. But doesn't he\nget nervous playing alongside such\nbig names?\n\"I don't get nervous,\" he confidently assures, 'although I don't want to make a mess.\" It's an attitude you need if you want to succeed, especially when you're playing in front of a knowledgeable fol-lowing. \"Yeah, the Limehaus\n[Bedford] is really good because\nit's such a genuine crowd.\" The\nbest gig so far? \" We did a gig in\nNorth London, at a huge S& JV1\nparty. We were using a12k rig\nthat's as powerful as the one at the\nMinistry, in a room half the size.\nEveryone was totally into the\nmusic: we overran by something\nlike four hours.\"\nHe doesn't just stick to DJing\neither. Working under the name of\n'The Dirty Stop-outs' with partner\nand manager Lee Peterson, he's done quite a bit of studio work.\nThe most note worthy involvement\nto date being a mix of 'Deep Day'\nby Katrina Vaughn on Wor X Records. He describes the process\nas being \"surprisingly routine at\ntimes,\" with the real satisfaction\ncoming when they catch their work\nbeing played by other DJs...\nJames Ratcliff is one of the\nmany DJs playing it in the mix on\nour Friday dance night.

    "content": "COLUMNS 27 February 1998\nAs I have been a bit slow\noff the mark this week,\nand am writing this on Wednesday morning, I can com ment on the Election results. In the\nwords of veteran political commentator, Bruce Forsyth, 'didn't they do well.' It seems that we have achieved a very favourable\noutcome- no New Election vic to ries, no hacks and a Mary's block\nvote that proved to be as effective\nas a chocolate teapot. Of course, I attribute the anti-hack vote to my last column, so 1 shall be expecting\na pint off each of the Daves in the\nfullness of time. Some new blood\nis exactly what is needed to shake\nthings up. This should not be seen\nas an attack on the incumbents,\nbut now the merger has hap-pen ed, the new thinking required\nis unlikely to be provided by people nurtured in the ways of old. This sounds like a call for a Thatcherite reforming zeal- what a good idea, as she once said. Congratulation also to Adam Cherrington, also from outside the\nUnion fold, though with some useful abilities in dealing with sports\nclubs. His ability to maintain a vertical stance while consuming alcohol has been called into question,\nbut is being worked on... Obviously, as a humble scribe, the\npost of Felix Editor is of the greatest interest to me, so it was good to see Ed Sexton triumph. Though\nboth candidates were sound, Alok\nJha's wish to turn\nFelix into a magazine sent a shiver\ndown my spine.\nOld lags who have been here\nlonger than is\nhealthy will\nremember the\nlast time this was\ndown in 1994\nunder the stewardship of Beccy\nLand. That must\nnever be allowed\nto happen again. Felix is, and must\nremain, a newspaper, which is\nwhat Ed has planned for next year.\nAny chance of a job, g uv, in what\nwill be my final year?\nMy friends at Schal were getting worried, as was lan Caldwell,\nCD\nno\nDQ\nCo on\nthat I hadn't paid them a visit for a while, so last Monday I donned\nthe hard hat and ventured onto the\nBMS site (thanks again to Phil\nHilton and Ollie Clarke). Since the\nplace is due to be handed over to\nCollege on 13th April, now seems\na good time to see what the state\nof play is. Miraculously, it is only\ntwo weeks behind schedule\nand still on bud-get, a first for\nImperial College.\nMy biggest con cern remains\nthat it will be lost\non the medics,\nwho will fail to\nappreciate such\na fine building.\nSUf That said, some\n^ j of the rooms have been\ndesigned to take straw on the\nfloors (only joking, folks!).\nSurprisingly, there are two huge\noffices for \"Students' Unions\".\nDoes this mean one for Mary's and\none for the RC SU?Do either\ndeserve one? The finished atrium\nwill look fantastic, consisting of\nmaple panelling and polished con-crete, which surprisingly will work\nwell. The most interesting design\nfeature, however, is not the roof or\nthe atrium itself, but the ground\nfloor toilets. For reasons best\nknown to Sir Norman Foster, he\nhas taken his inspiration for these\nfacilities from Southside, using\nvery, very similar black granite.\nThis has the potential to confuse\ninebriated medics and biologists\nmightily in lectures after a heavy\nsession, though some would argue\nthis will happen irrespective of the\nsanitary ware. All in all, it's looking\nvery good, and I await my invitation to the official opening.\nFor a College so steeped in\napathy, it is fantastic to see that\nthe Summer Ball has got off the\nground. This is precisely the sort of\nevent that IC needs to show to the\ncountry that we are a class act,\nboth academically and socially. For\nmy small part, I shall be shamelessly plugging it here form now to\nthe event, so buy those tickets, be\nyou staff, student or idle lay about. This Sunday, 1 March, the\nCountryside March will take place in\nHyde Park. Press coverage of this\nevent has been divided, on left-wing/right-wing lines, with left-wing\npapers suggesting that it is being\norganised by landowners and farmers who are doing quite nicely and\nare in no position to ask for more.\nOther papers suggest that the problems of rural areas are more serious\nthan the town ies would realise and\nmaybe it is time to take action.\nApproximately 80% of the population live in built-up areas, giving a similar make-up in the House of\nCommons, with the national\npress/TV consisting almost entirely\nof London-based journalists (papers\noften have North of England correspondents in the same way that\nthey have a German or US corre-sponde nt.) So perhaps it is understandable that country folk are disenchanted with the way things are\nrunning. The march, which may look\nsimilar to the rally held recently in\nsupport of fox-hunting, comes at a time of change in the countryside.\nEU members are planning to dismantle some of the Common Agricultural Policy so that taxes and\nfood prices can be lowered. Remember the CAP was designed\nwith the express intention of not\nhaving market forces invade agricultural production, with the fairly reasonable defence being that there\nhave been plenty of riots and wars\nin the past and the EU's main purpose is to rid Europe of these problems in perpetuity. The Government\nis pointedly not applying to the\nCommission for compensation British farmers are entitled to\n(under EU law) due to the appreciation of the pound. Other problems seem to await\nour country friends: the last\nConservative Government carefully\ndelayed a nasty decision on the\nand renovation costs before building on brownfield sites at all. But\nthe Council for the Protection of\nRural England are up in arms any-way, saying that Prescott will not\nkeep his word on the issue. They\nhave some justification - one of his\nfirst actions as Environment\nMinister was to authorise the building of 10,000 new homes near\nStevenage, and then telling West\nSussex to increase to 50,700 the\nHamish Common\nWestminster\nEye\npotential explosion in housing\nrequirements and the lack of space\nto build them, leaving their successors the choice of overcrowding\nand impossibly high house prices or\nbuilding on greenfield sites. John\nPrescott, the Deputy Prime Minister\nand Environment Minister, has\ndecided that 60% of all new homes\nmust be built on 'brownfield' sites -renovated urban land. This is not\npleasant for the building industry\nwho are aware that housing estates\nwith a nice view of the countryside\nsell rather better than those with a nice view of other buildings, and\nalso have to pay any contamination\nnumber of new homes it must\naccommodate (West Sussex is now\nseeking a judicial review).\nThe other issue that affects the\ncountryside also divides it - the\nissue of the 'right to roam', unfettered access to vast tracts of land,\nirrespective of who it is owned by.\nThis is one of the oldest issues for\nLabour, with memories of struggles\nagainst the landowners who also\nowned the factories and mines they\nworked at. Labour made a promise\nin its election manifesto that it\nwould introduce the right to roam,\ncompleted unfinished business\nfrom the 1949 National Parks and\nAccess to the Countryside Act,\nwhich a Labour Government intro-duce d, making the Peak District the\nfirst National Park and reinforcing\nthe laws on footpaths. It decided\nthen against the right to roam, leaving it instead to landowners them-selves, with the local authorities\nwatching over them and if necessary enforcing the law. Many people feel this has not worked, with\nvast tracts of land still inaccessible\nto the public. However, it appears\nthat that the Country Landowners'\nAssociation has convinced Downing\nStreet to backtrack on the right to\nroam policy, and instead maintain\nthe voluntary access agreements,\nimplemented (or not, as the case\nmay be) today. This will be an interesting choice for Downing Street to\nmake.\nIt is worrying the Government\nseem bent on discrediting the\nCountryside Rally by arguing that it\nis run by landowners and farmers,\nand that its view are not representative of the countryside com muni ty. That is the standard political preamble to completely ignore their\ndemands. Despite the stories that\nsome bosses have forced their\nemployees to attend the rally (other\nbosses have banned their staff from\nattending), if they get as many people out as they promise to, then it\nwill be a demonstration of solidarity\nthat the Government would be wise\nnot to ignore.\n\n"

    "content": "27 February 1998 ARTS 19\nCULTURE\nHENRI CARTIER-BRESSON\nPhotographs at the Hayward Gallery\nT his exhibition is primarily a celebration of one of this\ncentury's greatest photographers in his 90th year. Evidently\nCartier-Bresson has an extraordinary ability to find the character in\nthe crowd or the back street of any\nprovincial town. He dispels any\nnotion that photographic art is\nsolely for the appreciation of the\ninitiated with a style that is both\ndirect, human and displays a truly\nmagic eye. The photographs are\nsimplistic ally displayed, spanning\nnearly seventy years of travel\nthroughout Europe, from Istanbul\nto Islington. They refrain, however,\nfrom being journalistic or document at ive in style due to their\nobjectivity and their attentiveness\nto aesthetic effect. Hardly any of\nthe photos record a specific historic event, the vast majority\nfocussing on the description of the\nlives of ordinary Europeans.\nIt is easy to forget in this era of\nreadily available consumer durable s the privations and struggles which\nonly fifty years ago were common place. Cartier-Bresson takes us\nthrough the years of pre-war\ndepression and post-war reconstruction with marked optimism,\ncompassion and wit. High-spirited\nstreet children are portrayed playing in civil war torn Seville through\na bomb-damaged wall. Muscovites\ncrowd Red Square for the 1954\nagricultural show with not a product of collective farming in sight.\nThe astonishing spontaneity of\nthe photographs often result in a natural surrealism; one shot portrays a double bass seemingly riding a bike down a rocky Serbian dirt\ntrack to nowhere. One of the most\ntouching photos captures two sleeping lovers on a Romanian\nnight train, an acknowledgement of\nan instantaneous beauty that would\npass most of us by. One disappointment is the display's British\nphotos, which inevitably show less\nempathy with their primarily aristocratic subject matter.\nCartier-Bresson described his\nwork as \"putting one's head, one's eye and one's heart on the same\naxis\". We would strongly recommend this vast exhibition to any-one; it will not fail to inspire both\nEuropeans and non-Europeans.\nHelen Johns and Matt Williams\nPER KIRKEBY\nSculpture at the Tate Gallery\nFollowing the success of my last visit to the Tate,1 decided to return and con front the latest special exhibition on offer by that well known Danish artist, Per Kirkeby. Born in Copenhagen in 1 9 3 8 , his works include sculpture, paintings, drawings, prints, films and performing arts. He also writes poetry and prose. The exhibition is displayed in the central part of the Tate\nGallery and consists mostly of a series of large bronzes, supposedly representative of different body parts. I should add at this stage that if you have\nany body parts that resemble these then you should seek medical advice immediately. With a little insight and a lot of\nimagination it may be possible to see the anatomical forms envisaged by the artist; unfortunately these are skills which I sadly lack.\nThe largest exhibit on display\nwas specially created and can hardly fail to be noticed. Entitled \"Brick\nWall\", it is not just one large brick\nwall, but several arranged so that\nthey are parallel and interlinking,\ndisplaying superb bricklaying skills.\n1 walked around them several times\nwondering how to appreciate the\ntrue artistic potential of this piece.\nThe children unwillingly dragged to\nthe Tate by their arty parents\nthought it was great fun, as it provided the perfect backdrop for a game of hide and seek.\nThe exhibition runs until May but I wouldn't recommend making\na special trip, unless you are interested in bricklaying; your time\nwould be better spent looking at\nthe special Bonnard exhibition or\nwandering around the other gal-le ries. Claire Ashwin\nSHOSTAKOVICH\nBarbican Centre\nCAMPANAS FLAMENCAS\nPEACOCK THEATRE\nT he cycle of Shostakovich's music is being given rave\npress reviews. Somehow, these concerts are inspiring the\nLSO to play as if they are indeed\none of the greatest orchestras in\nthe world; credit for this remarkable achievement must be given to\nRostropovich, who was a great\nfriend of the composer for over 30\nyears. I found Rostro-povich's approach a little too serious for the\nmore frivolous pieces but this paid\noff for the more intense and atmospheric symphonic works.\nThe next ones include the popular5 th symphony in the same\nconcert as the 6th symphony, a chamber concert by an all star cast\nled by Rostropovich - this time\nshowing off his virtuoso 'cello playing - and two concerts of the 7th symphony. For those of you who are not so familiar with this sym phony or even of Shostakovich's music, the concert on March5 th will introduce this great musical\nand political work, written in\nLeningrad while under siege by the\nNazis.

Check this shit out, a whole page,\nyeah that's right a whole page. Is this hot or\nwhat? I was checking thru' Felix and I spotted\nthat the dance techno guys have a whole page\nfor their column, Electric Cafe, and then 1 saw\nthat IC Radio had a whole page, well at this point\nI decided 1 want a page and look at this I have a whole page (big props to jason and Alok, the\nmusic editors). A whole page means a whole\nhost of new stuff, check this out. You got the\nnormal ranting and raving from me, as well as\nalbum reviews for the real deal phat stuff, classic\ntrax all about the classics from back on the day\nand whatever other shit I can think of, this is Tha\nBomb.\nDid y 'all all see the\nBrit Awards? I caught\nmost of it, soul was in\nthe house and some awards even came this\nway, the biggest being\nBest Female and Best\nMale going to Shola and\nFinlay. But what the fuck\nwas going on with the\nduet between Texas and\nMethod Man? That was\nfucked, there was no\npoint, someone said to\nme that the rap just\nruined a pretty good song and I'd have to\nagree. Rumours of the\nNWA get-together have\nbeen confirmed; Dre, Ice\nCube and Yella will all be\ngetting together for a track on the soundtrack of\nthe new Cube movie. Eazy-E won't be there for\nobvious reasons and I ain't sure 'bout MC Ren.\nThe hot news in hip-hop is the Snoop Dogg situ-ation, basically Snoop wants to leave Death Row.\nRecently he told the press that his life was in\ndanger and with most of the people at Death\nRow either in prison or dead he's probably got a point. Another factor is the quality of his music,\nhis last album Tha Doggfather was the worst\nthing to come out of Death Row, the boy seriously needs to hook up with Dr Dre and start\nbring in' their skill z together to create the quality\nthat we saw on The Chronic and the classic\nDoggstyle. Saying all that, rumour has it that\nSnoop has already signed a new deal with another record label and has already started working\nwith Dre. The fact that he's signed to a six album\ndeal at Death Row doesn't seem to matter, keep\nan eye on this situation it could all get quite\nnasty.\nThis week sees the release of some wicked\nlittle tunes and they're even on UK release, so we\ndon't need to spend a fortune buying imports.\nFirst up is Holler by Ginuwine this has been\naround for a while and most consider it the best\ntrack off the album, phat bass line with the G Man's soil d vocals and\na pretty good rap make\nthis a wicked tune.\nQueen Pen delivers her\nalbum this week and to\ncon in cide comes the\nfirst single Man Behind\nthe Music, this first hit\nas an import in\nSeptember and blew up\nback then, this is still a track though. The\nTeddy production is\nslick with the swing beats in full effect and\nthe other members of\nBlackstreet even turn\nup for the hook, there\nare no real remixes to\ntalk of and ya better off\ngetting the album. The\nsoul man Lynden David\nHall is back with the seco nd cut from his\nacclaimed debut set, the track's called Do I Quality this is a serious bit of soul, returning to\nthe basics of simple tune and inspired vocals. If\nyou missed Sexy Cinderalla the first bomb from\nhis LP that's on the b side, the remixes aren't bad, for the connoisseur this is a must. The R&B track blowing up on import is The Weekend from\nthe Ride soundtrack, strangely the record company has decided to give it an early release date\nrather than waiting the normal year or so, and for\nthat we should be thankful, this is a TUNE. I ain't gonna say how good it is cause you should\nalready know, this ...well just buy it, you won't be\ndisappointed.\nSnoop and Deathrow fighting to part\nways, but who will get their way? We'll\njust have to wait and see.\nThe Phat Selection\nYou Make Me Wanna - Usher\nUsher still there doin' the business with this\nphat tune, even if its been out for a long time\nthis still rocks.\nThe Weekend - Dave Hollister\nTUNE, R& \u00a3 at its best with Redman and Erick\nSermon with the rap.\nWishing On A Star - Jay-Z Remake of the old classic with Jay-Z doin' a little rap, simple but a tune.\nMy Melody (LP) - Queen Pen\nCheck the review on this...

The Queen Pen has been\nthe best so far and that's reviewed here. Besides\nthat '98 has been low on real quality, some stuff\nhas come thru' on import but nothing really blew\nup. The much hyped Jagged Edge album is said\nto not have lived up to the hype, the tune The\nWay That You Talk made expectations real high,\nbut the album just couldn't live up to it. The Ride\nsoundtrack is the only thing to have caused any\ndamage on the scene, but even that wasn't out-standing, the lack of any real competition probably gave it such hype. Looking to the future there\nis some smart stuff to come, the pick is probably\nthe Faith Evans joint from the Bad Boy family,\nwhich has already got hype, the new Aretha\nFranklin album (first single already out and\nwicked, more next week) and the one I'm looking forward to most the Tony Rich album.

'The Chronic' was an introduction to brand new style and some new faces\n- The Death Row Inmates - DOC, Kurupt, That\nNigga Daz, Lady of Rage and of course the big\ndog Snoop. The amazing production from Dre\nmay never be surpassed by the man again, the\nkiller cut from the album was the stunning\nNuthin' But aC Thang, which featured more laid\nback gangsta vocals from Snoop. Wit Dre Day\nwas a straight dis to Eazy-E and everyone who\never cussed the West Coast. Next up was the\nclassy Let Me Ride a wicked piece of head nod,\nsampling the P funk king George Clinton's Mothership Connection, with Jewel on background vocals and RBX &. Snoop helping Dre\nwith the rap this was always destined to be a standout track. As well as those the album was\npacked with other gems, Lil Chetta Boy, RatTat-Tat-Tat and many others.

Throughout the\ngame, he gave everything to 'his'\nteam, turning down two blatant\npenalty appeals and booking half\nof the ICU team. However his\nworst crime was in the last minute\nwhen Bath scored their winner. A long ball down ICs right wing drifted a yard out of play. Everyone\nstopped, even the Bath striker\nwent to catch the ball, but the ref\nwaved play on. The striker drifted\ninside an unleashed a shot past the\nshell-shocked IC goalkeeper. Our protests were waved away and\nthere was nothing we could do. No time to score an equalise r. It was\nall over. When we lose to a better\nteam so be it, but to lose in such a manner rips the heart out of any\nteam, and make you think just is it\nworth it? Even their equalise r was\nstreaky.

    "content": "14 MUSIC 27 February 1998\nCLUBSCENE \u2022 THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE\nie\nAnyone connected with the London dance\nscene will tell you that techno is currently going\nthrough a bad patch. Some might even say that\nit is dying, slowly and painfully. Some so-called\n\"underground\" DJs who have become household names appear to have lost touch with the\nscene that nurtured and raised them. The whole\nthing has become too commercial, many argue.\nWith pro motors charging more and more to fill\ntheir nights with DJs who charge extortionate\nbooking fees, and competition from other\nhybrids of music such as drum'n 'bass, 97 was a terrible year for techno.\nThere is a growing voice however, that is\nproclaiming that techno doesn't have to die.\nAlthough the innocence of the summer of love\nnow belongs to an older generation and the\n'techno-purist' can no longer be catered for,\nthese people claim to have some valid reasons\nfor the survival of underground dance music.\nOne of the strongest reasons is Craig Thomas\nand his club Analog City.\nDespite being involved in electronic music\nfor many years, Craig is one of a new breed of\nDJs. He not only spins internationally on a regular basis, but he has learnt the ins and outs of\nthe music industry. His achievements include\nmusic production and the very succesful Analog\nCity nights. During the mid1990 s this was a club that introduced the sounds of techno to a large audience. The best American and European DJs could be found playing on the\nsame line-up as some excellent home-grown\ntalent.\nThe best DJs meant the best music of the\ngenre, and also an amazing array of turntable\ntechniques, transforming a pair of decks into a musical instrument. This all tied in with Craig's philosophy that techno music is more than just\ncomputerised grunts and farts, that the words\nelectronic and funky can be used as adjectives in\nthe same breath!\nStarting off as a music nut, Craig discovered\npromotion as a vehicle to further his own DJing\ncareer, rather than as a means in itself. After a few years involvement in the house scene,\nAnalog City was started in 1994. London's club-land is a notoriously fickle and competitive ter-ri tory, so it is quite an achievement for a club to\nbe running for so long. It is also a testament to\nCraig's musical background. Clubs may well rely\non business sense, but if you can find the balance between profit and putting on a good show (ie choosing the right DJs, understanding\nyour crowd, music selection) for your customers\nthen you're onto a winner! Besides its London\nresidency, Analog City has toured the UK extensively and even opened its doors abroad. Craig\ncites a recent tour of Croatia as a particularly fulfilling experience. \"It's amazing how a war-torn\ncountry can party. It doesn't matter what the\nfuck's going on around you. I played in a blown-out cinema. It was the best experience I 've ever\nhad.\"\nNext Saturday sees Analog City in London\nonce again. The night proves to be unique and\nspecial in many respects, but I 'll leave it to Craig\nto explain you his concepts in his own words.\n\"We're going for a completely different\napproach with this. Basically the nights we put\non in the past were on quite a large scale and\nthe prices to get in were also high (ten to fifteen\npounds). We're using the Analog City name and\nstill going for a large crowd and stuff, but we're\ntrying to keep the prices down. \"With this event we're offering a quality\nnight where everybody can pay five pounds. I think that if we can do that and still put on big\nunderground London DJs , with about fifteen\nplaying at each night (in three rooms) then it will\nbe a new way of approaching things. Also the\ncustomers won't feel ripped off that they're\npaying so much money, as they are doing in so\nmany London clubs at the moment.\n\"1 don't think you should be charging fifteen\npounds to get into these bloody places. If the\nmusic is meant to be underground, then why are\nyou paying completely astronomical prices? I'm going for an approach where you don't have to\ncharge that much on the door but you are getting quality DJs who are up-there in the techno\nscene.\"\nThat's right! This is a Saturday night club in\nLondon with fifteen of the best techno Djs that\nour city has to offer in three rooms and a cracking sound system for just five pounds. Cliched\nas it may sound, Craig feels that the well-being\nand satisfaction of the customer should come before mega six-figure profits. He is also showing us that spending thousands on commercially known DJs can be a waste of money. One thing we don't seem to realise is that techno\ncontains strength in depth. There are many spinners out there who can hold a crowd, fill a floor\nand keep a night going as well as any \"name\".\nThey should also be given a chance, and the\nrespect within the dance community that Analog\nCity commands is the perfect advert is ment for\npeople to notice them.\nThe approach to the structure and running\nof the night is also being experimented with by\nCraig. Rather than having one DJ to play a long\nset, the warm up will be two hours and each guy\nafterwards will be on for an hour. He claims that\nthis will press u rise all the DJs to \"produce the\ngoods\" quickly and within a set time limit. With\nmany different DJs playing so closely together,\nthe whole night looks like keeping a varied and\nfresh sound to it. This will be anything but boring boom boom techno!\"\nSo who are these DJs who will be strutting\ntheir stuff at Analog City! One of the highlights\nwill be James Ruskin, founder of the popular\nBlueprint label, and co-resident at Circulation in\nBrixton with Andy Weatherall. His style is\ndescribed as Jeff Mills-esque but with his own personal twist added. Charlie Hall has been\ninstrumental in the scene for years now.\nFormerly of the Drum Club Collective (a musical\ngroup and a legendary club), Charlie plays a varied selection but is known to be into his hard\nChicago house. Terry Mitchell is described by\nCraig as \"one of the best DJs I know\". His style\nis raw and in yer face, with scratching and cutting used alongside the techno player's trusty\nmixing skills.

    "content": "LETTERS 27 February 1998\nLetters to Felix...\nLET'S HAVE A GOOD MOAN Dear Felix,\nThe other week I was feeling a bit down on the world so1 decided to get away for a week with a mate\nof mine at Sheffield Uni and we had a little tour round the country\nto visit a few mates. We visited\nquite a number of Unions in the\nweek and most were very good Sheffield was absolutely fantastic.\nThis Friday I came back to the\ngood old ICU. I couldn't believe\nhow shabby it seemed compared to all the other unions in the co un try I'd been to. And to add insult to\ninjury they charge you to get into\nthe damn place. What really took\nthe biscuit was having sat down in\nthe Chill Out room with a load of\nmates (where we had a table and all had seats) 1 needed to nip downstairs to the toilet. Going out\nI noticed a queue so I said on the\nguy on the door that I was just\ngoing downstairs quickly could he\nlet me back in - 'Yeah no problem\",\nwas the repo nse. Coming back\nupstairs I tried to return to my beer, seat and mates only to find\nthe same lad telling meI was going to have to queue. What sort of\nidiocy is this? I can understand fire\nregulations meaning there has to be limited numbers in the room but\nsurely if you've got a chair and you have a word with the staff on the\ndoor before leaving they could let\nyou back in. There seems to be no\ncommon sense here.\nAll this has really riled me especially when I'm regretting my decision to come to Imperial in the\nfirst place (I took a year out before\ncoming here and could easily have\nkept on working instead of taking\nmy degree - I wish I had). The\nquestion at the moment I'm asking\nmyself is even if I pass my exams in\nthe summer doI really want to return to this money-grabbing institution which seems to remove all\nacademic ambition and breed\nsheer apathy.\nSorry about all that - rant over.\nCheers,\nAndy Hallas ( Me ch Eng I) WORDS OF WISDOM\nDear Jeremy,\nIt's not often that I write a letter to Felix, mainly because I spend\nmost of my life in the office as\nEditor Without Portfolio anyway,\nbut I'm afraid that I can't let Simon\nBaker (and others) criticisms of ICU\ngo unanswered.\nFirstly, to answer the argument\nthat there are too many committees in ICU. This must be the first\ntime I have ever seen anyone com plain that too many people were\ntaking an interest in running the\nUnion; the truth is that there is\nalways room for more help, and as\nChair of Publications Board I know\nthat 1 wouldn't mind a hand some-times. I agree that at first sight\nthere would seem to be a large\nnumber, but bear in mind that\nwhen trying to deal with over 2 5 0\nclubs and societies and serve the\nneeds of around 10,000 students\none necessarily has some complexity. Of course the C CU structure does confuse the matter\nsomewhat, but I 'll come back to them later.\nShin Yi Jeng and his AngloGerman society, Is y mpa this e that\nhe was needlessly and irritatingly\njuggled between two committees\nfor months. In the future I would suggest that when it is not obvious\nwhich Clubs and Society\nCommittee should take responsibility for a new club, that the matter be referred to the Deputy President (Clubs &. Societies) or\neven taken the ICU Executive\nCommittee. It is a shame that neither S CC nor OS C saw fit to take\nthis action.\nGetting on to the issue of\nCC Us,I used to be of the opinion\nthat they were a self-serving worthless historical anomaly. However,\nhaving seen what a reformed, forward looking a well-run C CU can\ndo( taking ICSMSU and to a lesser\nextent, R SMU, as shining exam-ple s)I now feel that CC Us are vital\nto the well-being of ICU as a whole,\nfor the following reasons;\n- They preserve the heritage and\ntradition of the disparate parts of\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for\nlength, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.\nLetters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe\ncard when submitting them.\ncollege. This provides a much-need-ed sense of identity to students who would otherwise struggle to identify\nwith ICU (which is, let's face it, a little bland, tradition-wise).\n- They provide an extra layer\nwhere students can become involved in clubs and societies, and also experience politics (yes, even\ncommittees). In a college where\nthe level of apathy is constantly\nbemoaned, it is surely a good idea\nto give students an opportunity to get involved wherever possible.\nFinally, what do you propose to replace them with? I agree with\nSimon that some of them should\nconcentrate on their essential roles\nof Academic Affairs and Welfare,\nand waste less effort on in-fighting\nand bitching about Felix, but the\nCC Us are an integral part of IC.\nRemove them, and you might as\nwell change the name to 'Metric\nCollege'.\nCheers,\nMark Baker\nPublications Board Chair &. Felix\nEditor Without Portfolio.\nSLEEPING DOGS...\nThis letter should have appeared\nlast week, but we mislay ed it.\nApologies.\nDear Editor,\nThank God someone has been\nbrave enough to draw attention to the rudest woman at the University\nin the accommodation office. My misfortune was to want to live at\nclay ponds, and the patronising\ntreatment that I received from her\nwas unbelievable ! Not only did I get\nshouted at, but as my English was then not too good she spoke in a very slow sarcastic voice tome, like\nI was a child! Why does the college\nhave such a person dealing with vulnerable students? There must have\nbeen other complaints over the\nyears and I have spoken to at least\nten others who have suffered in a similar way How can you complain\nwhen if you do you won't get any\naccommodation? We are intimidated by her, it is totally unfair. Where\nare you Rector? Sack the bulldog,\nand please get a spaniel!\nIda ren't give my name as I expect they won't do anything and I may need to stay in clay ponds again\nunfortunately.

The result was\ngreeted with a mixed reaction\n- cheers from the assembled\ncrowd interspersed with cries\nof \" Oh my God, the Union's being run by two barmen and\na steward\" from one senior\nunion figure.\nUnusually, the St Mary's \u2022\nblock vote, ordinarily the rj L decisive factor in sabbatical\nelections, failed to pick the\nwinners, with both Dave\nWharton( Deputy President\nF&S elect) and Dave Hellard\n(incoming President) over-coming pressure for a New Election from Mary's, to win\non the first re-allocation of\nvotes. Both victors carried\ntheir first round leads to success, although Dave Hellard was\naided by 146 second preferences\nfrom St Mary's, installing him as\nPresident for 1998-99, by 6 5 0\nvotes to 400.\nMeanwhile, Ed Sexton and\nAdam Cherrington both secured\nrelatively easy victories (as Felix\nEditor and Deputy President C&S respectively), with totals representing over 65. Messers Sexton and\nCherrington were also notable for\ngaining victories on every one of\nthe twelve polling stations.\nAll four of the victors proved\nnigh on incomprehensible by the\ntime the result was\nannounced, although they\nall managed to confirm\nthat they were \"Very, very\nhappy\". Having accepted\nthat \"I'm too drunk to\nmake a comment\", Dave\nHellard then went on to\nattempt to sack all the bar\nM staff, before being whisked\nJp away for celebratory drinks\nby his future DPs.\nCommenting on the\nwinners Rob Clark, incumbent D PF&S observed \"all\nthe candidates are inexperienced, but a month is a long time for a handover\".\nHowever, Andy Heeps,\nICU President and\nReturning Officer, countered that \"a lot of people\nmight be worried about\nn experience, but there's no difference between the situation\nnow and that when1 was elected in\nNovember\".\nMary's RAG Lead the Way\nKENT YIP\nSt Mary's Hospital Rag Appeal\nhas raised an enormous \u00a3 4 0 , 2 0 0\nin aid of the Leukaemia Research\nFund in this year's rag week.\n\u00a3 2 4 , 1 0 4 was collected during\nThursday's Circle Line Pub Crawl\nalone, breaking last year's record of\n\u00a3 1 9 , 0 0 0 .

This\nworks very well, because1 am not a big jazz lover, and I quite like this album. There are some very strong tracks on here that work well in\nthe clubs, as well as being an\nalbum you can sit back and list en to as a whole. It has a large\nmusical content( avast array of\nmusical instruments are incorporated into the sounds cape) and is cleverly constructed throughout with the tracks blended together, which is a pleasant change from most albums that have those anno ying gaps between each tune and tracks that do not follow from the one before. I could not make my mind up\nwether this is drum &. bass with a touch of jazz, or jazz with a heavy\ntouch of D&B as it is very evenly\nbalanced. And the rolling jazz licks\nnever really overpower or sound\nout of place here, they merely\ncomplement each other. It's nice\nto hear such original work. It has\nalready got it's own sub-genre,\nbeing described as lounge core by\nsome and this is a very fitting\ndescription as it sits neatly\nbetween being chilling lounge\nmusic and full on drum &. bass.\nAnother dimension of what is\nknow as drum &l> ass but you do, at\nleast, have to appreciate jazz music\nto enjoy this album. tTl cl Jo Public\nDRUM' N' BASS HOUSE Chocolate weasel. Music for Body Rockers.\n(Ninja)16th Feb.\nThis latest offering from T Power and accomplish is a slow tempo big beat sort of ting, with\nheavy electro influences. One of the mixes\nstarts off sounding like Billy Jean, then when the\nbass comes in it sounds like Another One Bites\nThe Dust; then the strong atmosphere ical s come in and you're away. This is my favourite\nmix. There's also Jah Rasta dub rag ga mix as\nwell that works and is a little different. '\nBowser. Street Beat EP.\n(Freshkanova) 2nd March\nA firing selection of beats, my favourite track is\nLet Ya Body Rock. Clever programming, nice little touches of scratching, lovely chopped up beats and plenty else going on to keep you\ninterested.

And he's still got the\ntouch, another truly breath-taking track. Those\nof you who' ve heard Blame's Logical\nProgression Pt.Z CD(a great moment in musical history), this is the first track from that CD. Drift along on the futuristic breaks, soothing b line, robotic voices &. deep lush break downs. Enjoy the visions of Mars.\nScarlet Lake. Into The Sun.\n(Temple Rec) mid March.\nThis sounds like Roni Size (b line) meets Bukem\n(clean crisp beats) which works well with a nice\ncheesy American film sample, but they have\nover done it a bit with the general jazz backing\nat times. Future Engineer's remix strips away\nthe Roni b line and jazz piano, makes it more of\nan out ' n' out intelligent style which I do like; it\ncould almost be Bukem.\nFifty Fifty. Tonight I'm dreaming\n(Jackpot) 1 st March\nI preferred the Amethyst's dub mix to the original which isn'ta bad track in itself. Amethyst\ncut down on the vocal, darken the at mos. and\nsneak some D& J5 style drum/brake patterns into\nthe programmer. Which all works rather well,\ncreating a hypnotic deep house feeling. The\noriginal mix is more vocal &. up-beat, with a stomping b line.\nThe Talisman & Hudson.\nHorizontal Recreation. (C.S. M.F) This is a hypnotic blend of deep house and\nelectro styles reminiscent of Orbital, but under\nthe smooth computer programming and bouncy bass-line there is quite a hard track hiding\naway. This is different to what I have been hearing recently, it has an early hardcore ('90-'92)\nfeel to it but with new technology making for a pleasant break from the norm. This track has\nstrength in depth, and will make a welcome\naddition to my box. 171 cl jo Public\n\n"

However,\nthe obstacle to justice is not the\njudge or jury, who seem to\nsym pathis e with the Africans, but\nthe pro-slavery President Martin\nVan Buren (Hawthorne) whose main interest lies in securing a second term in office and avoiding\ncivil war.

The direction is\nrelaxed and well paced with\nSpielberg opting to leave more to\nthe imagination he did in\nSchindler's List. Coupled with\nfantastic cinematography, Amistad\nis an excellent piece of film-making\nand the most artistic film Spielberg\nhas ever directed. From a director\nrenowned for his crowd-please rs, this must rank as one of his least\ncommercial. You probably won't cry; you will just enter deep thought.

The scene is\nset in Dr Feldman's office,\nand within the confines of this tiny\nauditorium it is almost as if you are\nsat in on what should be a private\nconsultation.\nAnita Parry really excels in her\nrole as Stephanie Abraham s, a young woman in her 30s that has\nbeen confined to a wheelchair by\nMultiple Sclerosis. She is pushed by\nher husband to seek help through\nthe well-known Dr Feldman (Peter\nEllis).\nStephanie starts the sessions\nwith a casual attitude; she obviously doesn't believe that the treatment is necessary as she has a strong character and a positive\nspirit. She has discussed the consequences of Multiple Sclerosis with\nfamily and friends and has come up\nwith several plans of action for the\ncoming years. Dr Feldman only\nserves to irritate her, and his de manding questions merely spark off\nan angry response. Stephanie was\nan extremely talented violinist\nbefore this disease destroyed her\nability and, seemingly, her purpose.\nDr Feldman's own love of the violin\nis evident and he appears to the\naudience to share some of\nStephanie's pain. However, she is\nblind to this and sees his questions\nas a sign of jealousy or incompetence. She feels that Dr Feldman\ndoes not appreciate her intelligence and she plays spiteful games\nto try to avoid a confrontation with\nher feelings. As the sessions\nprogress, she appears even more\nchild-like. Dr Feldman, however,\ncontinues to probe into her relationships with her parents and worried husband. The hard shell that\nStephanie has built around herself\nbegins to weaken and she finally\nunleashes the emotion that she\nwould have previously communicated through her violin.\nThis drama is profoundly intense. There are no scenery\nchanges, no fancy costumes and\ncertainly no singing or dancing.\nThe subject has obviously been\nwell-studied by both the director,\nJaneena Sims and the actors.\nAlthough Peter Ellis plays his role a little hard during the first act, the\nplay still reviews the stereotypes\nassociated with Freudian psychiatry\nand leaves you with a much more\nhumane impression of the prof es sion.\nExtra merit has to go to Anita\nwho talks almost nonstop throughout the two hour long play.\nOnce you have entered the story\nyou really do get involved. When she falls out of her wheelchair, in\none of the more dramatic scenes,\nyou instinctively jump up to help\nher before realising that you're in a theatre. You are left with a strong\nfeeling of reflection... not bad for a husband and wife duo who are best\nknown for playing in \"The Bill\".\nJenny and Demelza\nSALAD DAYS PREVIEW\nUnion Concert Hall\nL ater this week, Imperial\nCollege Union Operatic Society once again takes to\nthe floorboards to bring us 'Salad\nDays', a light carefree musical\nabout romance, youth and... well\n... a piano. After many weeks of\nrehearsals, and worrying, they have\nput together a show that must\nsurely contain something to appeal\nto most tastes - memorable tunes,\nlively performance, raunchy Dons,\nUFO's, cabinet ministers, and... well... a piano.\nThe story starts in a scene Iam sure will be witnessed by many in\nthe next few years - a graduation\nday. We meet two friends from well\nto do families, Tim and Jane, as\nthey both graduate and have to say\nfarewell. They insist on keeping in\ntouch and arrange to meet the following week, by which time they\ndiscover that both of their families\nhave different ideas about the\npaths through life they should take:\nTim to get a job with one of his\nuncles, Jane to marry. It is here that\nthey meet a tramp who pays them\nto look after his piano for a month\n- a piano that forces everyone who hears it to relax, dance and enjoy\nthemselves. Needless to say this\nleads them on a vast adventure of\nsecrecy, political scandals and\nquests for missing musical instruments ... well ... a piano.\nThe large cast equip themselves\nextremely well through the large\nchorus pieces with entertaining\nchoreography, and there are some wonderful solos by the leads.\nWorking with a particularly quirky\nscript they manage to adapt the\nhumour in such a way as to provide\nmoments of bizarre amusement\nand crafted wit.\nUnfortunately I was not able to\nsee the show in its full glory of dazzling costumes and bright lights,\nbut this certainly did not prevent\nthe cast from visibly enjoying themselves in a spirited performance. So\nin these last few days as they are\nbusy painting set, rigging lights and\ntrying to keep calm, maybe you\nshould be thinking about giving\nyour support to these enthusiastic\nperformers.\nMatt Williams\n10,000 BROKEN MIRRORS\nThe Oval Theatre\nWe read the press release\nfor this play after we had\nbeen persuaded by Julia\nto see it. Our hearts sank. \"Two\nteenage boys, thrown together by\ntheir parents marriage, develop a gay relationship.\" Oh no, three\nhours of doom. Fortunately this wasn't true. In\nthe opening scene the audience is\nintroduced to the four family members, Diana, Lawrence, Aleister,\nand Eddie, and the Sun and Moon, who look down on the proceedings\nfrom a raised mobile platform on\nthe stage. As the relationship\nbetween the two boys, Aleister and\nEddie unfolds and deepens, so that\nbetween husband and wife is seen\nto diminish, with more than a little\nhelp from the moon, who appears\nintent on \"helping\" the proceedings\non earth. Tensions between the\nfamily members, in particular the\ntwo boys are, in the beginning,\nmade strikingly clear, but as the\nplay progresses these feelings are\nreplaced by new animosity\nbetween the gay lovers and Diana,\nwho makes no secret of her disapproval of the situation.\nThe Sun and Moon are always\npresent, watching the family as\nthey live their lives. The Sun, representing 'Good' is content to just\nwatch and let those on earth\nresolve their own problems, but the\nMoon, portraying the 'Bad' has a misc he vio us nature and bored with\njust orbiting the earth, decides to\ngo down and 'help' the family, with\ndisastrous consequences.\nThe set was extremely simple\nand unusual, consisting of five platforms of different heights, on\nwheels. These doubled as beds,\ntables and the orbits of the Sun and\nMoon, being moved around the\nstage as their uses changed. This\nwas a little puzzling at first , but\nactually worked very well. The lighting also added a subtle touch, with\nthe Sun's yellow light guarding the\nmarried couple while the Moon's cold blue hue shadowed the illicit\nlovers.\nOur preconceptions of this play\nwere not good. After reading the\npress release and arriving at the\ntheatre, which looked like a gro tty primary school, we expected\nsomething much worse, and were\nsurprised to find we really enjoyed\nit.\nOh, and by the way, look out\nfor Tenebris Light on your tube\njourney in the morning, as he works\nfor London Underground!\nHayley and Marina\n\n"

    "content": "27 February 1998 NEWS\nWHO Covers Up Drugs?\nJON TROUT\nWorld Health Organisation officials in Geneva who produced a report last December entitled\n\"Cannabis: A Health Perspective\nand Research Agenda\" have been\ncalled into disrepute, following\nallegations in New Scientist mag-a zine. The New Scientist article concerned the suppression of a draft\ncontaining a comparison between\ncannabis and the legal drugs alcohol and tobacco. The leaked do cu ment concluded that the amount of\ncannabis smoked worldwide not\nonly harms public health less than\nalcohol and tobacco, but would be\nlikely to continue to do so if consumed on the same scale as these\nlegal substances. New Scientist\nclaimed that the WHO had \"bowed\nto political pressure\" in removing\nthe comparative analysis \"at the\nlast minute\" following intense dispute between WHO officials,\ncannabis experts and \"external\nadvisors\". The official line on the\nwithdrawal was that \"the reliability\nand public health significance of\nsuch comparisons are doubtful\".\nThis was echoed by the rushed\nWHO press statement, released 19\nFebruary, in defence of their pos i tion, which stated that there was\n\"no attempt to hide information\"\nand that the decision not to include\nsuch a comparison was \"based on\nscientific judgement and nothing to\ndo with political pressure\". The\nstatement went on to admit that\nthe background article \"A Comparative Appraisal of the\nHealth and Psychological Consequences of Alcohol, Cannabis, Nicotine and Opiate Use\",\nwhose conclusions were dropped, contained several\ncontradictions and conclusions\nwhich \"were not\nscientifically sound\", suggesting that\nNew Scientist\nhad been looking at an erroneous,\nearly report.\nSpeaking to Felix, David\nConcar, author of the article and\ndeputy editor at New Scientist,\npresented a different side of\nevents: \"Iam very familiar with their\npress statement\" he remarked\ndryly; \"we knew exactly what we\nwere looking at. We were not looking at the wrong article.\" He acknowledged that it was the back-ground paper in question, but\nclaimed that the whole report\n(Cannabis: A Health Perspective, a Research Agenda) was to be based\non the conclusions of several back-ground papers, written by\nexperts in\n1995, and that the comparison was\nremoved following the\npolitical influence of\ngroups such\nas the United\nStates National Institute on Drug Abuse and the\nUnited Nations Drug Control Both groups are\nthe legal is ation of\ncannabis and would see this comparison as ideal ammunition for\npressure groups. \"They claim that\nthey pulled it because it was not\nscientifically sound, but we at New Scientist went through the do cu ment very thoroughly and we could\nsee no such problem\". Mr Concar\nInternational\nProgramme, opposed to\nwent on to say that it was an ongoing issue and that the WHO have\nnot seen the last of New Scientist.\nWhen asked if the damaged relations would prove problematic, he\nretorted: \"That's journalism. We are\nhere to report the facts, and what\nwe say is in clear conflict with the\nWHO. We know what that document represents.\"\nFelix then contacted Phillippe\nStroot, the Co-or d in at or of Media Relations at WHO headquarters in\nGeneva, who forwarded all questions to Dr Monteiro, one of the\nauthors of the cannabis report. As\nFelix was going to press, Dr\nMonteiro had not commented. Mr Concar did warn Felix, however, \"to\nexpect nothing but the official line\nfrom Geneva.\"\nA copy of the background article has been unearthed, and the\nauthors finish the paper by stating :\n\"There are good reasons for saying\nthat [cannabis] would be unlikely to\nseriously rival the public health risks\nof alcohol and tobacco even if as\nmany people used cannabis as now\ndrink alcohol or smoke tobacco\".\nThis certainly gives credence to\nNew Scientist's claims, but it is\nunlikely that the apparently political\nreason for its omission will be officially admitted in the near future.\nNo Butts for JCR Caterers\nTONY OFORI\nSmoking in the JCR and the adjacent area\nbetween the JCR and the Senior Common Room is facing a possible total ban following a recent\nmeeting of the Health and Safety Committee.\nAt the meeting, held on12 February, the committee expressed their concerns over the practicality of continuing with the existing arrangement\nCurrently, there is a lack of accommodation for those who wish to smoke in the JCR so this\nmove will anger many that feel they are already\nin an ill-catered for minority. A possible solution\nlies in the proposed refurbishment of the JCR\nwhere a properly ventilated smoking area is\nprovided. However this scheme which was originally supposed to be completed in 1997, i may be postponed again this year. Another possibility under consideration is the instalment of an\nair-recycling machine in the corridor outside the\nJCR.\nIC's smokers forced to resort to desperate\nThe main thrust for this change seems to be\nattitude of the catering staff. They dislike the\nintense smell that e menat es from the corridor\nand the rubbish that accumulates. The\nChairman of the Health and Safety Committee,\nJohn Foster, reiterated this saying that the caterers find the environment \"very unpleasant\" and\n\"feel uncomfortable about entering the area to\ncarry out cleaning\". Another reason for the\nchange is that the corridor is seen as a possible\nseating area for the overflow from the JCR.\nThe Committee feels strongly about of the\nwithdrawal of this unofficial smoking area, and\nthere are rumours of catering staff strikes if\nthings continue the way they are. The college\nsecretary has been contacted over the affair and\nif the Health and Safety Committee get their\nway the new ban could take effect from the end\nof this term.\n\n"

    "content": "8 COLUMNS 27 February 1998\n[LDLTLTQ\nWhoops! A sI'm sure you'll all have noticed\nthere was a bit of an error in last week's special\n- we've already done carrot cake. It should\ninstead have been that old favourite Turnip\nSurprise. No bother, just replace the word carrot with turnip everywhere and Baldrick's your\nuncle.\nThis week I'm doing a serious meal for seriously hungry people. Both the dishes are typically French and go down very well with a few\nbottles of red.\nCarbonade de Boeuf\n*\" I kg beef, shin is best, cut into squares\n\u20145x5x2 cm200g smoked pork belly, diced\n\"~ 500 g chopped onion\n*\" 1 litre cheap o lager\n\u00bb\u2022 2 t bl flour\n3 cloves of garlic, crushed\nHeat up a fair amount of oil in a( big) pan\nand fry the meat until well brown as usual.\nWhen it's nearly done add the pork belly and fry\ngently for around 10 minutes so that it renders\nits fat (i.e. the fat melts and seeps out). Don't forget to add a large pinch of pepper to season\neverything.\nTake the meat out, drain well keeping as\nmuch fat in the pan as possible and put into a low oven to keep it warm. Now delicately sprinkle the flour into the\npan and fry gently until it starts to turn brown.\nPour in 3\nA I of the beer, stir well and have a good sniff while you bring the liquid up to the boil.\nPut this roux to one side.\nFinally, fry the onion gently until it turns\ntranslucent and slightly brownish on the edges.\nRight, that's all the heavy stuff out of the way\nand now it's time to put everything together.\nIn a large solid pan, place first a layer of beef\nWe had a picture of a potato, but this\npicture of some Colorado beetles ate it.\nand pork then a layer of onion and repeat until\nthere is none left. Add a bouquet garni. (This\nconsists of a stick of celery, some sprigs of\nthyme and a few stray ends of parsley all\nwrapped up in the green bit of a leek and tied\nup nicely with a piece of string, bow-tied if\nwanted.) Also add the garlic, a couple of tb is of\nsugar and a pinch of nutmeg. Pour the beer roux\nin. If there isn't enough liquid to cover everything add the remaining 'A I beer until there is.\nCover the pan and put on a low heat for at\nleast 2 hours. The longer it cooks the better.\nCratin Dauphinois\n1 kg potatoes\n\u00ae- 1 '/i pt milk\n\"~ 2-3 cloves of garlic, crushed\nPeel the potatoes and slice them up as finely as you possibly can. The ideal situation is for\nthem to be tr ahs lucent. This will take a lot of\ntime and effort and you will get bored but hey,\nthis is serious cooking we're talking about.\nOnce that is done, give them a rinse in cold\nwater and drain well. This gets rid of some of\nthe starch and stops this dish getting too\nstodgy.\nSlowly heat up the milk, season it with a large pinch of salt, some pepper and a bit of\nnutmeg. Get your favourite oven dish (a thick\nceramic one is a bonus but not necessary), oil it\nlightly and smear the crushed garlic cloves all\nover the sides and bottom.\nPlace the sliced potatoes in the dish and pat\nthem around until it looks flat and even. Pour\nthe milk over, put a few knobs of butter on the\ntop and slide into the oven, gas mark 4/5, 180190\u00b0C. The gratin needs to roast for at least an\nhour, preferably two.\nTHOUGHT FOR THE DAY:\nCannabis: to smoke or not to smoke...\nCannabis is a substance that is\ndefinitely in the public eye at\nthe moment, with the alleged\ncover-up of the World Health Organisation report concerning its\neffects on health in comparison to\nalcohol and tobacco, and a recent\nsuggestion from the British Medical Authority that the law should be\nrelaxed in cases where marijuana is\nused medicinally. There is no place\nwhere these issues are contested\nmore strongly than inside College\nitself, and with the large volume of\nbusts and tribunals which make\nAndy He eps' job that little bit hard-er, it seems a very ripe time to\naddress the issue.\nMost of the effects of cannabis\nseem to involve \"saying hello to\nMr. Gravity\", falling over, \"feeling\nwell mellow, man\", giggling, eating\nquantities of food that would give\nWeight Watchers a hysterical fit,\nand forgetting what it was that...\nerm... oh. The bad effects of\ncannabis are such ac liche that Iam sure everyone aged fifteen and up\nknows them by heart: short-term\nmemory loss, destruction of con-cent ration, anti motivational syn-d rome, cancer... However, the old\nwacky bac cy' s popularity is definitely high at the moment. Remember all that fuss about people rolling joints in BBC2's \"This\nLife\"? To portray smoking in such\nan off-hand and socially acceptable\nway resulted in many complaints,\nbut seldom has a drama captured\nthe reality of the 90's toking phe-nomen on so well.\nI never came into contact with\ndrugs of any form until I was thoroughly corrupted by coming to IC.\nWhen a certain young individual\nstrolled into my room in hall in the\nmiddle of my first term last year\nwith the promise of \"a mega bo st in' reefer\", I immediately\nsprang out of my self-contemplative apathy to go to see what all the\nfuss was about. I was presented\nwith an evil-smelling hunk of brown\nmuddy mulch, and I found myself\nthinking straight away how many\npeople had had it up their rectal\ntract for it to get where it was now.\n1 was interested, but not\nenough to try it; four people disappeared up to someone's room, becoming denizens of a depraved\ndrug gy den, and I sat and watched\nthem.\nWell, statistically, I imagine a fair proportion of you lot know\nwhat transpired; Orbital, Kettle\nChips, improvised smoking equip-ment, long and eloquent tirades\nabout methods of \"skinning up\",\ndetailing the process with construction al accuracy that would put\nany contractor to shame.\nIt is not my place to pass judgement on dope, even if I felt compelled to. What 1 saw was a lot of\npeople enjoying themselves.\nPerhaps it was the thick brown\nhaze floating menacingly several\nfeet below the ceiling, or alternatively the spectacle of users sitting\ncross-legged on the floor, unable to\nget up, but I had a very pleasant\nevening as well. There can be no\ndoubt that Mary Jane has a strong\nallure, and will undoubtedly be\nused or misused for many generations hence, but I believe that the\nissue of damage to those who indulge will probably always be in\ncontention, and, I reckon, rightly\nso.\nAll Campbell\n\n"
