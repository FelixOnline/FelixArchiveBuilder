From\nstreet performances in Covent Garden he has shot up the comedy league\ntables with hits at the Fringe, the Melbourne Comedy Festival and, in 2011,\nthe Royal Variety Show. His unique\nbrand of comedy has to been seen to\nbe believed.\nHearing, of course, is not an op-tion. His tricks make extensive use of\nprops and audience participation all\norchestrated with twitching eyebrows\nand beckoning gestures from behind\nhis trademark strip of ga\ufb00a tape. The\nKiwi performer\u2019s silent routines call to\nmind the innocence of vaudeville as\ntwee violin music sets the sound track\nto his childish, yet immaculately conceived stage antics.\nThe Boy was kind enough to answer a few questions for Felix ahead of\nhis, now sadly \ufb01nished, London stage\nshow.\nMeredith: How did you \ufb01rst enter\nperformance?\nThe Boy: At the age of 13 I knocked on\nthe door of the local clown in my town\nand asked if he would take me on as\nhis assistant. I knew a few magic tricks\nand he taught me how to juggle.\nM: Where did the idea for the character of the Boy with Tape on his\nFace come from?\nB: I used to do a show that involved a\nlot of talking and me performing some\npretty crazy circus sideshow stunts.\nAfter several years doing shows like\nthis I wanted a new challenge so I decided to develop a show that had no\nwords and no tricks.\nM: How did it feel to be asked to do\nthe Royal Variety Performance last\nyear?\nB: It was one of the highlights of my\nyear. Growing up, The Royal Variety\nPerformance was a really big deal, so\nto have been the \ufb01rst New Zealand comedian to make it onto the stage was a\nfantastic feeling.\nM: What did princess Anne say to\nyou?\nB: I decided to keep the tape on when\nI met her as I thought the 20 seconds\nconversation wouldn\u2019t be that interesting and a photo would be better. I\ndid secretly record the entire conversation and you can listen to it on my\nwebsite.\nM: What is it about the character of\nthe Boy that gets such a reaction?\nB: I think that people like something\ndi\ufb00erent to the overload of talking\ncomedy and the fact that it is a bit of a\nthrowback to vaudeville times. People\nlike innocent humour and stu\ufb00 that\nappeals universally.\nM: Do you feel vulnerable on stage\nwithout being able to speak?\nB: Not at all! If anything I am the one\nwith the most power as I know exactly\nwhat is going on.\nM: Do you feel you are getting your\nown back by convincing others to\nperform in stage?\nB: I would never want anybody onstage to be in an embarrassing situation as, for me, that is not funny. Every\nvolunteer will leave the stage to a huge\nMeredith Thomas Arts Editor\nMan demonstrates top half of \u2018final\nsolution\u2019 for Kim Kardashian problem\nJi-Eun Lee\nPlay.Back.Again.Then\nround of applause as they have helped\nthe show happen.\nM: How do you go about \ufb01nding\nnew ideas for material?\nB: I listen to a lot of music and I try\nand look at everyday objects in di\ufb00erent ways. It can be a little hard at times\nas you end up holding something like\na broom for half an hour trying to \ufb01nd\nsomething funny about it that nobody\nhas ever noticed.\nM: Do you use real ga\ufb00a tape?\nB: I use a super quality brand of tape\ncalled Nashua 357. I ship it from Australia to my parents who the post it to\nme here in the UK as it is the strongest tape I have ever used... and no it\ndoesn\u2019t hurt when I take it o\ufb00.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nHighlight EVERYTHING\nCaroline Wood on The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of studying\nhis week many of you will\nhave been camping out in\nthe Library preparing for\nexams. (I feel your pain.)\nThis is the \ufb01rst time in 4\nyears that I am not sitting exams this\nJanuary (\ufb01st punch) and so instead of\nfrantic cramming I\u2019ve taken some time\nto look into some of the best, and the\nworst, revision techniques. (Once a\nnerd...)\nIt\u2019s two days before your \ufb01rst exam.\nAs the last minute panic starts to set\nin, what is your weapon of choice for\nensuring you get the content from\nthose last few lecture slides o\ufb00 of the\npage and into your head? Many of\nus are guilty of turning to the trusty\nhighlighter. Bland lecture notes are\ntransformed into a sea of \ufb02uorescent\nyellow, green and pink as we pray that\nthe technicolour page will imprint itself on our minds. The hope is this can\nthen jump from our head to the exam\npaper. However, in new research published this Wednesday by the Association for Psychological Science (and reported on by TIME magazine), it has\nnow been proved that highlighting is\none of the most ine\ufb00ective methods\nof study for most people. (I could have\ntold you that based on my 2nd year\nexam results, but now it\u2019s \u201cscienti\ufb01cally proven\u201d and \u201call o\ufb03cial\u201d.)\nTo all those serial highlighting offenders out there: read on to \ufb01nd out\nhow to go from cramming zero to\ncramming hero. This is a guide to the\ngood, the bad and the ugly of studying\ntechniques.\nThe Good\nYou envy the person who takes revision in their stride. (Or maybe you\nare that person, in which case \u2013 con-gratulations!) But with these few tips\nyou should breeze through your studies like you are as cool as Vanilla Ice\n(baby).\nThe study reports that there is a\n\u201ccheats\u201d way of learning very large\nquantities of challenging material in a\nvery short time. A method never before known outside the psychology lab\nhas now been revealed.\nOK, I just made that up. Sorry. In\nreality, the result of the study is un-derwhelmingly expected. One of the\nmost e\ufb00ective methods reported is\ncalled \u201cdistributed practice\u201d. Basically this is a fancy term that means\nstudying over a long period of term.\nYep, covering lecture notes during the\nterm and then re-covering them at\nregular intervals has been proved to\nbe one of the most e\ufb00ective methods\nof study. Cramming gets a big thumbs\ndown. Hardly surprising.\nBut wait a second. Before you start\nheading over to your tutor\u2019s o\ufb03ce to\nquit your degree, there is a dim light\nat the end of the gloomy studying tun-nel. The second best learning strategy\nis what the authors call \u201cpractice testing\u201d. This means that recalling information from memory is conducive\nto learning. E\ufb00ectively, all those past\npapers are actually worth while! Yesss!\nAnother method that can help\n\u201cpractice testing\u201d is the use of \ufb02ashcards \u2013as you are forced to recall information from memory. And in yet\nmore good news, if getting all arts\nand crafts and making \ufb02ash cards is\nnot your style you\u2019ll be pleased to hear\nthat there are now digital app versions\nof \ufb02ash cards such as Quizlet, StudyBlue and FlashCardMachine. Pretty\nsweet.\nThe Bad\nYou know the bad already. You just\ndon\u2019t want to admit that you know. I\u2019ll\nmake it short and painless. Things not\nto do when studying:\n1. Reading\n2. Underlining\n3. Re-reading\n4. Highlighting\n5. Summarising\nOf course these methods may work\nfor some people. But in general, highlighting can draw you attention to speci\ufb01c facts and decrease your ability to\ndraw connections between di\ufb00erent\nareas. Reading, I assume, can be good\nfor some people. However half read-ing, half day-dreaming about what\nyou\u2019re going to do after exams have\n\ufb01nished is probably not ideal. It may\nbe a bit surprising that summarising is\non this list of what not to do. An often endorsed method is shunned by\nthe authors of the report as they claim\nthat there are more e\ufb00ective ways to\nbest utilise study time. You got told.\nThe Ugly\nTo say these techniques are ugly is\nslightly misleading. They are actually\nthe techniques that are not especially\ne\ufb00ective, but not completely crap. But\nthe good, the bad and the medium\ndoesn\u2019t have quite the same ring to it\nso here goes: the ugly.\nVisual learning or using mental imagery has been dubbed \u2018alright\u2019. It can\nbe e\ufb00ective but it\u2019s also quite time\nconsuming and is, of course, only useful for things you can visualise. Wave\ngoodbye to this method for your\nquantum modules...\nElaborative interrogation is another\ncomplex term used that has quite a\nsimple meaning: question everything.\nContinuously ask yourself \u2018why\u2019 questions as you study so you check you\nunderstand where everything comes\nfrom. This sounds great in theory.\nHowever the likely outcome is that\nyou will discover you have no idea\nwhy you assume x is positive and subsequently realise you don\u2019t even know\nwhat x represents before deciding to\n\u201cjust accept it\u201d.\nSelf-explanation, or forcing yourself\nto explain the text in detail instead of\npassively reading it over can be good.\nThis comes with a caution: e\ufb00ectiveness depends on how complete and\naccurate your explanations are. High\nrisk \u2013 high reward strategy?\nFinally, the keyword mnemonic. You\nassociate new vocabulary with other\nwords in imaginative ways. For example when learning the French word for\nkey, \u201cla clef,\u201d you can imagine a key\non top of a cli\ufb00. (Example curtesy of\nTIME magazine.) Good luck associating something with \u201cmacromolecular structure determination by X-ray\ncrystallography or solution nuclear\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy\u201d.\nMost of these techniques require a\nhigh time:learning ratio. They can be\ne\ufb00ective but when you have 8 modules to learn in 8 days they are pretty\nmuch a no go.\nSo there you have it. Two tips to\nexam success! Go over your lecture\nnotes and give \ufb02ashcards a chance.\nHappy revision and good luck if you\nstill have exams this January!\nT\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\n10\nThis is the kind of attitude that will get you a 2:2\nJust admit it: you have once had a set of notes that look like this\n\n"

    "content": "LOLCAT OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nJust be honest\net me level with you. Since\nbecoming Editor I have\nvery often worn glasses. I\nconsider myself a contact\nwearer. However, I ran out\nof contacts and I just haven\u2019t had the\ntime to go to get more. Okay, I\u2019ll be more\nhonest, I have had the time to get more\ncontacts; I just personally preferred to\nspend that time relaxing. So, in the spirit\nof honesty, I have changed the picture\nabove.That\u2019samoreaccuraterepresentation of what I usually look like when I\nwalk about campus (except in real life\nI\u2019m much more handsome, and taller,\njust). I\u2019m sorry for duping you all for so\nlong, but I decided to fess up. I hope you\nappreciate me telling you the truth and\nnot sugar coating it.\nThe reason I say this is because of\nsome of the articles in the News sec-tion. Relax, I haven\u2019t made a bunch of\nstuff up. Matt Proctor\u2019s article compar-ingOxbridgetoImperialisaninteresting\nread and shows that some people have\nit just as tough, if not tougher, than us.\nTruth is: I wish we could have managed\nto compare the full timetable and also a\nmean \u201ctime working\u201d statistic between\nall equivalent (and roughly equivalent)\ncourses at Imperial and Oxbridge.\nUnfortunately, as you can I\u2019m sure\nunderstand, that would take an insane\namount of time, effort and research. It\nwould be a really great way of seeing\nhow \u201chard\u201d the degrees are and a great\nway of ranking universities. However,\nendless time and resources, and the\nability to get every student to honestly\nsay the exact amount of time they are\nworking each week, is pretty much im-possible. It would be a great article, but\nisn\u2019t possible, so we had to do what we\ncould with our limited resources. I think\nit still has its merits. In fact, I think the\npure contact hour approach is a good\nindicator for science subjects about\nhow much work you are expected to do.\nMore lectures and labs = more work at\nhome, as more revision, because you\nhave more content to learn.\nWhy not engineering subjects? To\nbe honest: it\u2019s because it was difficult\nto compare Cambridge and Imperial as they do General Engineering\nand also couldn\u2019t find the information.\nSo, instead of only some information, I\nthought it\u2019s best to focus on the science\nand medicine and leave the engineering\nto a possible later date. Also, if you keep\nholding features like this back until they\nareperfectthenyouwillneverrunthem.\nThe reason I thought of honesty\nwas because of the front page about\nthe hospitals closing the A&E Departments. Shaping a Healthier Future... by\nclosing A&E Departments and making\nahubinonehospitalthatwillmaketrav-el times very long. I\u2019ve been in an ambulance with someone and can tell you,\nthe quicker it gets to the hospital the\nbetter for both patient and those with\nthem anxiously waiting. If they said \u201cwe\nhave to close A&E Departments as we\nneed to reduce our deficit and we think\nthis is a good way of doing it as with no\nmoney we can\u2019t run any hospitals\u201d and\nsay \u201cin my position what would you do?\nNo hospitals, or some with reduced service\u201d then at least they would be being\nhonest. If money were not an issue here\nwould you still close them? That\u2019s my\nkey question to them. You can all guess\nthe answer to that one. (Note that I\u2019m\ndeliberately ignoring the possibility that\nit\u2019s all just about making the Trust into a\nPrimary Health Care Trust.)\nOf course, they could be being completely honest and have no worries\nabout the deficit at all. The trouble is\nthat everyone is so full of spin, sugar\ncoating, and gentle positive highlighting that people assume someone is at-temptingtopullthewooloveryoureyes.\nIt\u2019s problematic to say the least.\nSo, tell the truth, then maybe everyone can just be honest and we\u2019ll be able\nto have constructive, serious, real world\ndiscussions.\nOh, and that drop cap (the big \u201cL\u201d) at\nthe start was supposed to always be in\neditorials, but I kept forgetting to do it.\nCOMMENT TV FOOD\nDid you do SOLE Doctor Whaaaat?

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY 23\nThe Argentinian dance troop came to\ntown preceded by its reputation. Some\nsix years ago, Fuerzabruta re-opened\nthe Roundhouse with an acrobatic extravaganza that left a permanent mark\nin the minds of so many Londoners as\nthe most amazing show they had ever\nseen. The group, directed by Diqui\nJames and Alejandro Garcia, combines\nhigh-tech light and sound e\ufb00ects with\nelegant pirouettes to create dashing\nvisual e\ufb00ects.\nTouring the world after its \ufb01rst suc-cesses, Fuerzabruta took its time to\ncome back with an updated show. Several of my friends sent me the link for\ntheir new gig, highlighting how \ufb02abbergasted they had been at the time. It\nwas indeed exciting: the press release\npromised a man bursting through walls\nat full throttle, and pairs of elegant\nswimmers hanging just on top of the\naudience\u2019s head.\nFinally something I haven\u2019t seen be-fore! But as is often the case, sequels\nare never as good as originals\u2026 And\nunfortunately, Fuerzabruta does not\nbreak that pattern. Not that it\u2019s a bad\nshow. It was simply not that impressive,\na bit out-dated even. In fact, it rather\nfelt like a group of high-tech crowd entertainers rather than a magical optical\nexperience.\nI might be harsh here, but let me\nexplain: the whole spectacle is based\non the use of clever lighting, move-Emilie Beauchamp Writer\nable stages, and harnessed performers\nwhich allow for high-\ufb02ying \ufb02ips. For\nexample, a man is walking on a large\n\u2018treadmill\u2019 is pushed at the centre of the\ntheatre amongst the audience. Soon he\n\ufb01nds obstacles on his way which he has\nto dodge, facing wind, clouds and rain\n(a wind machine, dry ice and a hose).\nUntil a wall hits him! But the wall is\nmade out of cardboards, and you can\nsee it coming and I mean literally see\nNot waving but possibly drowning\nit coming\u2026\nThat being said, the experience is\nvery interactive. The crowd, standing\nin the middle of the parterre, is asked to\nmove around, dance and clap throughout during the show. A carnival mood\nperspires with a live Argentinian band\nsinging and loudspeakers blasting\ntechno music. This atmosphere would\nhave been mind-blowing if it was set at\nFabric or Ministry of Sound, but at the\nRoundhouse\u2019s setting amongst a family\naudience, the artists\u2019 grins and shouts\ndidn\u2019t seem to reach the audience. It\nwas as if the production had put all its\nmoney on fancy visual e\ufb00ects and had\nforgotten to create a story line and add\npersonality to its characters. The end\nresult is a fragmented spectacle, leaving an aftertaste of shallowness.\nYet, some numbers were fairly entertaining \u2013 not for the actual skills of the\nperformers but for the technical beauty\ncreated by the set. The most stunning\npiece was when six women paddled\nand splash in two large transparent\ntarps \ufb01lled with water suspended right\nover the audience\u2019s head \u2013 a truly bucolic vision. Sadly I couldn\u2019t appreciate\nit for that long as my neck soon started\nhurting from craning it to look upwards for 45 minutes\u2026\nI could recommend Fuerzabruta as\npart of a special night out; the Roundhouse o\ufb00ers late shows at 10 pm from\nThursday to Saturday which would\nbe worth the \u00a330-40 tickets. Oh, and\na warning note: this is not meant for\nclaustrophobes or epileptics.\nWinter flooding cause reassessed as girls\nadmit extreme reaction to Tom Jones\nPhoenix 2013 needs\nan editor now!\nwww.facebook.com/Phoenix.IC\nImperial College\u2019s annual arts review\nmagazine is looking for writers, designers\nand contributors and most importantly an\neditor.\nIf you are interested please email:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

I should imagine he has an incredibly di\ufb03cult\njob attempting to mire the two ends\nof the tertiary education system:\nHigher Education (Universities) and\nFurther Education (more vocational\ncourses). The two systems \u2013 in my\nopinion -have very di\ufb00erent needs\nand objectives. And so how can one\nbody, the NUS, ever hope to properly represent everyone? Well, I don\u2019t\nthink it can.\nAt a recent NUS Conference the\nphrase \u201cWell, there\u2019s the Russell\nGroup, and then there\u2019s the rest of\nus\u2026\u201d left the mouth of the NUS\u2019s Director of Policy, Jim Dickinson. As\nmuch as I found Jim a great speaker,\nthis sentence, for me, perfectly explains why I don\u2019t think Imperial is\na suitable member of the NUS.

    "content": "HANGMAN\nhangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\nThe Hangman review of 2012\nT\nhis year will probably be\nmost remembered for a few\nthings: fat men dancing ir-ritatingly, and then other\npeople copying it even\nmore irritatingly. The year that Prince\nHarry\u2019s bumhole was paraded around\nas though he were a drunk fresher on\nthe way home from TigerTiger. The\nyear that Princess Catherine the \ufb01rst\nof Middletonian was photographed\nnaked on holiday with His Williamness-thank-fuck-he\u2019s-not-Charles\nPrince \u201cWills\u201d of Windsor. This proximity to him in an undressed state\n(allegedly) caused a Royal BabyTM\nto\nbe announced. This was just after the\nLevesen enquiry produced a roughly\n2000 page report that nobody read\nabout how people who take pictures\nup women\u2019s skirts are slightly dickish,\namongst other things that are less tit-tilating. One person who read this (the\ncount is now up to a grand total of two\n\u2013 one being Levesen himself) was David Cameron. If you don\u2019t know who\nhe is then please avert your eyes, as\nyou probably don\u2019t want to \ufb01nd out.\nSure you want to proceed? Fine. He\u2019s\na sort of robot made from pastys that\nare taxed at 3000% who was created for\nthe sole aim of hiring men who may or\nmay not call policemen plebs but de\ufb01nitely rides a bike like he\u2019s from a BBC\nshow about 1920s Cambridgeshire.\nBack on to David Cameron: he\u2019s the\nPrime Minister. That means his job\nis to be posh, or something. He read\nthe report, which basically apparently\nsaid something about having a watchdog for the press. This is what everyone can only presume was said in it,\nbecause obviously no journalists have\nhad the time or will to read the report:\nthey either a.) skim read for \ufb01ve pages,\ngot bored, and skipped to the conclusions and watched a video of Leveson\nsaying what he thought if they work\nfor the Guardian or b.) control found\n\u201csex\u201d and \u201cdrugs\u201d \u2013 try it for yourself\n\u2013 in the hope of \ufb01nding out that someone from TOWIE sni\ufb00ed cocaine\nfrom Prince Harry\u2019s bumhole if you\nwork for the Daily Mail. None of them\ndid by the way. His Prime Ministerist\nDavid Cambot said: \u201cNAH, fuck that,\nlet\u2019s just basically have it like it is now\nand go back to not watching Steve\nCoogan talk about paparrazi and OH\nMY GOD THERE\u2019S A ROYAL BABY\nON THE WAY! FUCK YEAH! WILL\nIT BE TWINS?\u201d\nAnyway, other signi\ufb01cant happenings were that everyone suddenly\nheard about a guy named Kony that\npeople started caring about for a bit\nthen forgot who he was and no longer\nreally care about. It seems Kony is taking lessons from Assad on how to be\nan arse and noone care.\nThere was also big news for Britain. The Olympics turned out to not\nbe shit, which everyone thought\nthey would be. There was a massive\nOpening Ceremony telling the story\nof Britain until it was stopped to let\nLord Coe talk about how great everything is, and the man with the least\ncharisma in the world, Jacque Rogge,\nwin a bet he made with a mate about\nhow dull he could make his speech. At\none point the Queen jumped out of a\nplane and was then forced to watch an\nhour or so of athletes walking around\ndressed up like \ufb02ight attendants or, in\nBritain\u2019s case, a teenager from 1993\ngoing on a night out in his best pair\nof trackies. There was also a slightly\ncrapper Closing Ceremony, which\nresembled the entertainment at Butlins. Although Butlins would never let\nGeorge Michael perform a high energy version of \u201cFreedom\u201d followed by\nhis new song that nobody reading this\ncan remember. The Closing Ceremony\u2019s shittiness can be summed up by\nthe fact that the even got downgraded\nin the \u201cwhat Royal is forced to watch\nthis\u201d league.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that it wasn\u2019t a good\nyear for Jimmys. First it turned out that\na man who acted like a creepy, sinister\nold man actually was a creepy, sinister\nold man. \u2018Sir\u2019 (obvious reasons for the\ninverted commas) Jimmy Savile was\nsuch an unpalatable character that\nif he were an ingredient even every\ncontestant on Masterchef combined\ncouldn\u2019t \ufb01nd a way to work him into\nan okay dish. Then Jimmy Carr turned\nout to be avoiding tax like it was the\nplague. Although, when juxtaposed\nwith Savile like that, his scandal was\nde\ufb01nitely not that bad by comparison.\nOf course George Osbourne, who, if\nyou don\u2019t know what he is, is a sort\nof pug nosed man with a debilitating\ncondition causing him to permanently\nbe pulling a cum face, was \u201cshocked\u201d\nto hear this as his job doesn\u2019t involve\nmoney and taxing people at all.\nOh, and the Queen has been on the\nthrone for ages. To celebrate this, a\nload of boats went paddling about in\nthe Thames, with the Queen and others forced to stand and wave for so\nlong that technically it could be classi\ufb01ed as torture (USA will have taken\nnote no doubt and start making prisoners do this too).\nBoris Johnson, who\u2019s a \ufb02oppy haired\nchildren\u2019s cartoon that occasionally\nplays the London Mayor on TV saw\na surge in popularity as he bumbled\nabout, got stuck on a wire (sadly noone had any eggs handy to throw), and\ngenerally worked the PR machine in\nhis bid to be crowned King.\n2012 was the year that Obama got\nre-elected as it became increasingly\ndi\ufb03cult to defend voting for Mitt\nRomney solely based on the fact that\nhis hair is nice and he looks a bit like\nan actor who might play the President\nin a disaster \ufb01lm. Fun fact: this isn\u2019t\nthe \ufb01rst time he\u2019s run for President.\nHe never got this far before though,\nas clearly seen when his inexperience\nshowed through as he forgot to stop\nsaying dickish things and calling nearly half of the population free loaders.\nLast year will also be remembered\nfor the year that you could be knighted\nfor being really good at riding a bicy-cle. \u201cBut it\u2019s about the hard work and\ndedication and training and not taking performance enhancing drugs and\nbeing inspirational and a good role\nmodel\u201d. True. Good point. But still,\ndedication to riding a bike. Fast. Yes.\nBut still riding a bike.

    "content": "NEWS\n6 FRIDAY 11 JANUARY\nOur workload woes\ns students of Imperial\nCollege, we often regard\nourselves as some of the\nhardest worked students\nin the country. A quick\nGoogle search reveals many students\u2019\nreviews of their time at Imperial. One\nsuch review on a website called WhatUni.com, which o\ufb00ers advice to those\napplying to University, from a former\nPhysics student says:\n\u201cThe most important piece of advice\nI can give you is that if you come to\nImperial you need to work HARD.\u201d\nAnother review from a CivEng student says:\n\u201c[The College] set so much work\nfor the sake of it, and really do not\ncare about you but instead only about\ntheir own reputation... Way too much\nwork\u2026\u201d\nAlso,\n\u201cThe boy girl [ratio] is a complete\njoke. It is bad enough being at 68:32\nbut when you look at the standard of\ngirls you would cry\u201d\nBut that\u2019s for another article...\nAre these damning reviews at all\ntrue? We may spend the odd night too\nmany in the Library, but how do we\nactually compare with the likes of Oxford and Cambridge when looking at\ncompulsory work hours?\nArguably, as members of the Golden Triangle (an uno\ufb03cial group of\nthe leading universities in the UK,\nconsisting of Oxford, Cambridge and\nLondon-based universities including\nImperial and UCL), we should expect\ncontact hours, such as those spent in\nlectures, to be roughly the same. Let\u2019s\nlook at the average number of contact\nhours per week for \ufb01rst year students.\nSurprisingly, for three of the four\nsubjects listed (Physics, Medicine and\nBiology), Imperial has far fewer contact hours than Oxbridge.\nPhysical Natural Scientists at Cambridge have almost twice as many\ncontact hours as Physicists do at Imperial. Not only that, but both Oxford\nand Cambridge have almost twice as\nmany lab hours. It could be said that\nlab work is an incredibly important\npart of a Physics degree and the techniques learned in practical sessions\nare incredibly valuable throughout\na physicist\u2019s career, especially if they\ncontinue on to do research. The thing\nis, most \ufb01rst year physicists at Imperial, including myself, think that we\nhave too many lab hours each week\n(perhaps the content, not the lab\nhours, needs an overhaul). It\u2019s not as if\nour course is more theoretical either,\nbecause both Oxbridge courses have\nmore lecture hours too.\nMathematicians at Imperial get a\nslightly better deal, with the same\nnumber of contact hours as those at\nOxford as well as more hours of lectures than both other universities.\nCambridge students have four hours\nof tutorials or \u2018supervisions\u2019 each week\nwhereas Imperial students only get\none hour. A \ufb01rst year maths student\nwho studies at Imperial and wishes\nto remain anonymous questions the\nmerits of tutorials however, \u201cI think if\nyou have a good tutor they can be really helpful but sometimes I think tutorials with older pupils might be more\nhelpful because they still remember\ngoing through the process of learning\nthe concepts themselves.\u201d About computing sessions, which Cambridge\nstudents miss out on, \u201cThey\u2019re tricky\nbut quite interesting\u2026 if a little time\nconsuming.\u201d Another maths student,\nEamonn Postlethwaite, agrees, \u201cEven\nthough we have only two hours of\ncompulsory computing contact hours\na week, it\u2019s probably the most individually time consuming one of our modules because of the nature and relative\ndi\ufb03culty of the coursework.\u201d\nMedicine is a similar story to Physics, with Oxbridge medics having\nmany more practical hours than those\nat Imperial. However, unlike those at\nOxbridge, medics here get the chance\nto meet patients in their \ufb01rst year.\nLottie Whittingham, a \ufb01rst year medic at Imperial questions the bene\ufb01ts of\nthis, \u201cI\u2019m not entirely convinced of the\nvalue of seeing patients, other than for\nmotivation.\u201d She is unperturbed however by the unequal practical hours, \u201cI\nthink they\u2019re more suited to a course\nwhich frequently leads to research\nrather than clinical practice\u2026 I don\u2019t\nthink it makes you a more competent doctor, they are more just to aid\nunderstanding.\u201d Melanie Coates, another medic, disagrees. She explains\nwhy she believes patient interaction\nis important, \u201cIt keeps all the science\nand theory you\u2019re doing in lectures\nrelevant to becoming a doctor.\u201d\nBiology, a traditionally lab-based\nsubject, su\ufb00ers the same problems\nthat Physics does: very few lab hours\nand tutorials. Ryan Cooke, a Biology\nstudent, still \ufb01nds that he has a lot of\nwork to do: \u201cNote-taking is engul\ufb01ng\u201d\nbut questions whether a degree from\nImperial is really worth the high fees\nwhen compared to Oxbridge, \u201cI feel\ncheated out of my \u00a39000\u2026 and relieved I don\u2019t have that many hours\n[as Cambridge] but cheated! A sour\nbreeze rolls over my relief!\u201d Of course,\nthis opens up a whole other debate\nabout whether the high cost is justi\ufb01ed, but other factors such as employment prospects have to be considered.\nWhen comparing the average number of contact hours to league table\nrankings, we see that Cambridge,\ntopping the majority of lists, has the\nhighest average and Imperial, the bottom of the three here, has the lowest.\nDoes that suggest that heads of faculties should revamp the timetables?\nDoes it mean that we actually don\u2019t\nhave that much work? Well yes and\nno. Contact hours are exactly as the\nname suggests: we are in contact with\nthe lecturer/tutor/demonstrator and\nwe have to do some work, be it making notes or performing experiments\n(or at least turning up). But this is only\nreally half the story, how heavy someone\u2019s workload is depends on how\nmuch independent work they want to\ndo too not just how much time they\nspend in lectures*.\nJust to make you feel even worse, if\nyou still think you have a stupendous\namount of work to do, what about arts\nstudents? James White, a Classics student at Cambridge, has seven hours of\nlectures & seven hours of supervisions\na week. Miriam Stoney, an Art History student at Oxford has only three\nhours of lectures, one hour of classes\nand an hour\u2019s tutorial. She explains,\n\u201cMy workload in comparison to the\nscientists probably appears considerably kinder, but I think the nature of\nmy degree demands a greater contribution to introspection.\u201d\nJames o\ufb00ers an explanation to his\nseemingly light timetable, \u201cAt \ufb01rst\nglance it may seem that science students have a lot more work than arts\nstudents but I think the amount of\nwork and reading that has to go into\nsome essays is sometimes underestimated by science students. It took me\n\ufb01ve hours to understand a chapter of a\nbook on my reading list.\u201d Right James,\nright...\nEditorial page 2\n*Disclaimer:\nOf course, compulsory hours aren\u2019t\ncompletely representative of how much\nwork students at one university do over\nstudents somewhere else. It depends\non the individual and how much they\nput into doing lab reports or problem\nsheets. Interviewing lots of people to\nfind out how much time they spend on\nindependent work would itself take an\nage so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve only compared\ncontact hours. But in a sense, the work\nyou do independently is proportional\nto the number of contact hours you\nhave, so this article isn\u2019t a complete\nwaste of time.\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMatt Proctor compare us to Oxbridge to see who works harder\nA Cambridge is full of a bunch of punts\nImperial\nCambridge\nOxford\nLectures\n8\n13\n10\nLabs\n6\n11\n14\nTutorials\n1.5\n4\n1\nPhysics\nMaths\nImperial\nCambridge\nOxford\nLectures\n13\n12\n10\nComputing\n1\n0\n1\nTutorials\n1\n2\n4\nImperial\nCambridge\nOxford\nMedicine\nBiology\nImperial\nCambridge\nOxford\nLectures\n3\n10\nPracticals\n10\n12\nTutorials\n1\n4\nPhysical Natural Scientists at\nCambridge have almost twice\nas many contact hours as\nPhysicists do at Imperial\nTables of contact hours, as during revision you didn\u2019t see enough tables...\nLectures\n10\n10\n9\nPracticals\n2.5\n14\n10\nTutorials\n4\n4\n3\nThe Cambridge Punting Company\n\n"

    "content": "Is South Park going south?\nMaximilian Eggl gets animated about the latest season\nike it or not, South Park\nis a cultural phenomenon,\noften quoted, reminisced\nabout or each episode\ncarefully dissected. The\nfact that South Park just \ufb01nished its\n16th season does nothing to lessen its\nappeal; in fact the show has now been\nextended to \ufb01nish in 2016 bringing it\nto 20 seasons.\nThe 16th season \ufb01nished on the\n7th of November, and the reviews are\nmixed. There was some good as well\nas some bad. Here are my opinions of\nthe latest season.\nThe \ufb01rst half of the season overall\nwas somewhat disappointing. On\n\ufb01rst viewing of almost all episodes I\neither was confused at the story line\nor disappointed at the missed opportunities for great and memorable epi-sodes. \u201cReverse Cowgirl\u201d, the season\u2019s\nopener about an apparent need for\ntoilet safety and an attempt to sue the\ndead, parodied the security checks in\nairports (which was quite \ufb01tting) as\nwell as the US legal system. It was a\npromising start and it did have some\nfunny moments, however it will not\nbe a South Park classic so to speak.\nThat summary can be applied to most\nof the other episodes of the \ufb01rst half\n\u2013 \u201cFaith Hilling\u201d, \u201cCash For Gold\u201d and\n\u201cButterballs\u201d all had very promising\nbeginnings, but either \ufb01zzled out\nquietly or ended on an incomplete\nnote. The most memorable in this\nset of episodes was \u201cI Should Never\nHave Gone Ziplining\u201d. Parodying the\nadventure/reality documentaries that\nusually run on the Discovery Channel, History Channel etc., it featured\nan extended scene in which Cartman,\nKyle, Stan and Kenny were all acted\nout in live-action. While not adding\nanything in particular to the plot, it\nis a memorable moment in the season as all of a sudden you see actors\nin the place of your favourite cartoon\ncharacters.\nThe second half of the season was\nmarkedly better, with the majority of\nepisodes impressing on the \ufb01rst view-ing. Here, the real de\ufb01ning episodes\nof the season were revealed. \u201cRaising the Bar\u201d, dealing with the whole\nHoney Boo-Boo situation and with\nJames Cameron saving the day, was\nalmost perfect, hitting exactly the\nright places. \u201cInsecurity\u201d tapped into\nthe Batman mania that surrounded\nthat time. I chuckled quite regularly\nduring that episode, and must say it\nis vying for a place for my favourite\nwith the previous episode mentioned.\nAll the other episodes, bar \u201cA Scause\nfor Applause,\u201d were of that same high\nstandard and in my regard, restored\nSouth Park to its high pedestal, from\nwhich it had fallen during the \ufb01rst\nfew episodes. The last episode of the\nseason \u2013 \u201cObama Wins!\u201d \u2013 was the\nperfect ending for a much improved\nset of episodes. Hailed the best episode of the season (which I agree\nwith), it deals with the US presidential race and in a stroke of genius ties\nit in with the purchase of Star Wars\nby Disney (starring the absolutely\nphenomenal Mickey Mouse).\nAll in all this season of South Park,\nwhile not one of the best, is one of\nthe better ones, mainly thanks to\nthe strength of the latter episodes.\nThese later seasons do not have the\ngreat plots of earlier episodes, however their success in dealing with\ncurrent issues is astounding. Generally with this season and other recent\nepisodes, I found on second viewing\nthat even the \ufb01rst half of the season\nwas enjoyable. This may be attributed\nto the fact that once I knew that the\nplot really wasn\u2019t going anywhere, I\ncould focus on the jokes within the\nepisode itself. South Park is a show\nthat is at times very random, and so\nperhaps I should have expected this\nfrom the start. However one thing I\ndid not like about this season, is the\napparent change in the character of\nCartman. Cartman used to be the kid\nyou just loved to hate. Nowadays he\njust seems to have lost his touch; in\nfact he gets quite friendly with Kyle\nand even seems to follow some kind\nof moral code. This is not the Cartman I love watching, maybe he will\ncome back again. Nevertheless let us\nhope for the future that Trey Parker\nand Matt Stone do not lose their\ntouch and keep churning out entertaining television.\nL\nDoctor Who is a contentious show.\nIt is praised by some critics for its\ngreat imagination and the in\ufb02uence\nit has had on other SF programming.\nOthers claim that it has never really\ngone beyond its original concept as a\n\u2018family show\u2019 \u2013 a term seen by many\nas a euphemism for \u2018children\u2019s programme\u2019. Not that these opposing\npoints of view are mutually exclusive\n\u2013 a major London fan group recently\nvoted Doctor Who the worst SF show\nof 2012 while at the same time proclaiming its leads the best genre television actors of the year. I have much\nthe same attitude myself, having previously said on pages that I believe the\nshow\u2019s episodes can be split up into\nthree categories \u2013 a third of them are\nbrilliant, a third are just plain disappointing while a third are so bad that\nthey\u2019re good. I had, however, found\nall the episodes in the \ufb01rst half of the\nlatest series, broadcast earlier in the\nyear, surprisingly enjoyable so I had\nhigh hopes going into this Christmas\nspecial. Unfortunately, as I was soon\nto \ufb01nd out, \u2018The Snowmen\u2019 lies \ufb01rmly\nin the \u2018disappointing\u2019 category.\nThe episode begins an indeterminate amount of time after the end of\n\u2018The Angels Take Manhattan\u2019 \u2013 with\nthe Doctor, still grieving for the loss\nof Amy and Rory, living the life of a\nrecluse in Victorian London. However, the return of old enemy the\nGreat Intelligence and the appearance of the mysterious Clara, looking\nsuspiciously like Oswin Oswald \u2013 the\nwoman turned into a Dalek who was\nkilled at the end of \u2018Asylum of the\nDaleks\u2019 \u2013 soon convince the Doctor\nto come out of his early retirement.\nThere was nothing particularly\nwrongwiththestory\u2013itwasjust,well,\npainfully average. Using the Great\nIntelligence as the antagonist meant\nthat there were plenty of references\nfor fans of the Second Doctor and\nold Doctor allies Strax and Madame\nVastra make a welcome return but\nthe episode itself was just a repeat\nof the same tropes and clich\u00e9s that I\u2019ve seen in Doctor Who and in countless\nother SF shows dozens of\ntimes. Perhaps the show\u2019s\ncreators thought that a\nsafe, uninspiring episode\nwith a cookie cutter plot was\njust the thing for audiences\nwho had just \ufb01nished their\nChristmas dinner and\nwere unlikely to be paying\nfull attention to the episode\nbut for someone who\u2019s seen\nas much genre television as\nI have it was just boring.\nThe best thing about\nthe episode was the introduction of\nthe Doctor\u2019s new companion, Clara.\nIntelligent, adventurous and witty,\nshe seems the perfect addition to the\nshow. She also has a very intriguing ability, which looks\nlike it will dominate the\nstory arc of rest of the series \u2013 whenever she dies\nshe seems to be reborn in\nsome di\ufb00erent period of\ntime. For a while it even\nseemed that the Doctor was \ufb01nally going to\nhave a companion form\na time period other than\nour own, until the episode\u2019s\ncoda revealed that it was a\npresent day version of Clara\nthat would be travelling with\nthe Doctor. Still, I am looking\nforward to seeing more of her\nwhen Doctor Who returns in\nApril.\nOMG they keep making shitty episodes.

The idea that success can be\naided by imagining how great it would\nbe to lose those pounds, get that job\nor kiss that girl is only one philosophy and not only is it not supported\nby evidence, the evidence actively opposes it. This unscienti\ufb01c approach\nwas further highlighted by choosing\na Steiner school as the host venue\nfor the meeting. This was not a co-incidence. I raised this with Sanderson Jones afterwards who said that\na Steiner school was what they had\ninitially sought, the fact that this one\nwas in an old church building was just\na happy coincidence. This is no small\nmatter. Steiner schools promote homeopathy among their pupils and do\nnot provide inoculations, which puts\nchildren\u2019s health at great risk.\nThen we came slightly closer to a\nproper prayer. Sanderson got us to\nshout \u201cLife is good\u201d and \u201cLife is great\u201d,\nagain with the reasoning that simply saying this would have a positive\nimpact on us. But ignoring the lack\nof psychological evidence here, I\u2019m\nnot sure I agree with this. You see,\nlife isn\u2019t necessarily good. Really shit\nthings can happen and we need to see\nthem for that. If atheists are to adopt\nthe stance that \u201clife is good\u201d then we\nmake ourselves no better than those\nwho slavishly repeat \u201cGod is good\u201d as\na hurricane bears down on them. An\nimportant part of maturity, I feel, is\naccepting that shit happens so make\nthe most of the good stu\ufb00. Blind\n\u201chope\u201d is simply an atheist\u2019s version\nof blind faith and equally \ufb02awed. Bah\nhumbug.\nShould interest in pseudo-science\ncontinue, The Sunday Asssembly will\nnot \ufb01nd me or many other rationalists in its numbers. However, I have\nhope. This was just the \ufb01rst session of\nwhat is hoped to become a permanent\nmonthly \ufb01xture. There is room for\ndiscussion and change, as the organizers themselves stressed throughout.\nBeing comedians, the organisers have\ndone a great job of creating a fun, lively atmosphere which will be a big selling point for the services. But no one\ncould expect them to be \u2018all things to\nall men\u2019. They may not know about the\nresearch behind so-called \u2018self help\u2019 or\nof the beliefs of Steiners. As they gather momentum and interest and take\non more voices, there is no reason to\nthink that the Assembly can\u2019t change.\nHere\u2019s hoping they will.\nLeaving the service, I, and most of\nthe godless congregation, were struck\nby a bolt of irony as a real, bona \ufb01de\nChristian church service was going on\nin the hall next door from an African\nevangelical congregation. So how different was our service to this, the \u2018real\nthing\u2019? And what is it that will make\nthose who actively oppose one join in\nthe other? The atheist church needs\nto provide the good stu\ufb00 of regular\nchurch with none of the bad stu\ufb00 of\nirrational belief or evangelical zeal.\nMy verdict from the \ufb01rst day? It\u2019s on\nthe right track. I and most attendees\nleft the service feeling a little happier\nabout life \u2013 we certainly had a good\ntime. The idea of sermons is a positive one, but may need more focus on\na message than making people laugh.\nHymns were fun and the re\ufb02ection\ntime may have a purpose but they\nshould be sensitive to those who may\nbe made uncomfortable by the religious overtones. The \u2018self help\u2019 style\nstu\ufb00 should be toned down and not\ncentral to the service. The connection with the Steiner school should\nbe seriously questioned. But I do feel\nthat The Sunday Assembly could well\nbe the start of a great thing. I left the\nplace like most did, feeling like I\u2019d\nenjoyed myself and encouraged to\nbe around like minded people interested in exploring and celebrating\nlife. Sanderson and Pippa make for a\ngreat team \u2013 what they need are more\nvoices on board. Sciencey people, arty\npeople, philosophy-y people \u2013 people\nto give the church a wider vision and\na wider appeal. There are improvements to be made but I\u2019d like to be a\npart of those improvements. London\nnow has its \ufb01rst atheist church. In\ntime, I think I might just be a convert.\nAlok Prasad\nitting at my desk, slaving\nover acres and acres of\nlecture slides, I hear the\nfamiliar two-tone emerging from my laptop. An\nemail has arrived. I hurry to check it,\neager to escape the dull monotony of\nwork. \u2018Dear Student, Please note that\nSOLE is open for evaluating...\u2019 Aaargh! Delete the email, and continue\nworking...\nThe endless SOLE emails are a\nnuisance for most people, who have\nlots of things going on with their\nlives, and no-one seems to want to/\nhave time to respond. We\u2019ve all been\nthere. It\u2019s completely understandable.\nUntil recently, I was thinking the\nvery same thing. Then, on the last day\nof term, I had the chance to have a\nchat with my Faculty\u2019s Head of Quality Assurance and Enhancement. He\nlamented that the rate of response to\nSOLE questionnaires was low, but\nwhat struck me was what he said\nnext: \u201cHow can the Faculty possibly\nchange anything, if they don\u2019t know\nwhat the students think is going badly!\u201d\nNow a signi\ufb01cant number of people\nwill respond to this saying: a) Their\nFaculty does not do anything even if\ncomplaints are registered; b) Their\nFaculty has a laissez-faire \u2018We don\u2019t\ncare\u2019 attitude towards students (or c)\nTheir faculty actually has done something good after receiving a com-plaint, but we\u2019ll get onto that later).\nOur apathy seems to be inherent\nin many areas. Turnout for Student\nUnion Elections for Postgrads and\nUndergrads, were 19% and 58% respectively this year (we were the best\nin the country!). That\u2019s still a huge\nnumber of people abstaining from\ntheir right to in\ufb02uence their quality\nof education. Considering that our\ndegrees are our ticket into working\nlife, I \ufb01nd this \u2018lack of interest\u2019 shock-ing.\nI have to ask: why is there such a\n\u2018lack of interest\u2019 in our own educa-tion? Being a medic, I feel best placed\nto talk about some of the problems\nthat we have been having. The overriding feeling is that we feel completely and utterly uncared for by the\nFaculty, as highlighted by Imperial\u2019s\nrecent problems with Student Satisfaction. There just does not appear to\nbe any help or support readily available from the Faculty, contributing to\nthe sense of apathy felt by students.\nThere is very little academic help\nforthcoming to students who may\nbe struggling with the rigours of the\ncourse. There is no help o\ufb00ered to international students, for things such\nas accommodation, in the event that\nthey have a resit. There is no help for\nthe travel costs between the various\ncampuses and hospitals that we are\nrequired to be at, which is inherently\nunfair on poorer students.\nFor our problems, we have to rely\nmostly upon our excellent Union,\nmost of whom have volunteered to\ndo the job and are working on a shoestring budget. In my view, it is completely unfair to burden the Union\nwith jobs the Faculty is being paid by\nus to do.\nNo wonder levels of apathy are so\nhigh!\nBut the Faculty can and has\nchanged things for the better. For\nexample, we received a lecture for\nwhich the lecturer did not cover the\nlearning objectives set out, and did\nnot even appear to know what was\non his own lecture slides. There was\na lot of dissatisfaction amongst the\n300-odd people sitting in the lecture\nhall, which was immediately made\nknown to the Faculty. Within a very\nshort period of time, they sent out a\nresponse, apologising for what had\nhappened and the action they would\ntake to remedy the issue.\nThe key here (unlike the other times\nI have protested) was that a vast\nproportion of those a\ufb00ected, com-plained! The Faculty simply had no\nchoice but to respond! In many cases,\nthe curriculum has been changed as a\nresponse to large amounts of collec-I was going to write a column on apathy...\nAlok Prasad is tired of our lackadaisical attitude\ntive student feedback.\nThe higher the number of people\ngiving feedback, the more obliged\nthe Faculty is to change things! Low\nresponse rates \ufb02y in the face of the\nfact that each one of us is investing a\nsubstantial amount of time and money (especially international students)\ninto pursuing a quali\ufb01cation here at\nImperial.\nWe have to collectively be vocal in\nour views to make a di\ufb00erence. Write\nmore emails, do more SOLE, talk\nwith your Year Reps!\nWe are paying customers of Imperial College London and it\u2019s about\ntime that we demand the service that\nwe deserve.\nS\nThere is\nvery little\nacademic\nhelp for those\nwho may be\nstruggling\nwith the\nrigours of the\ncourse\nAverage Imperial student\u2019s\nbedside table\n\n"

Each debate is against a room of teams made\nup of the best student debaters in the\nworld. The event is the largest debating tournament in the world, with\nover 1000 speakers, judges and organisers in attendance.\nThe Berlin competition was eventually won by a team from Monash University (Australia); a university that\nhas now won the WUDC three times\nin a row.\nThe Imperial team and judges were\nselected in internal trials within the\nCollege, which were adjudicated by\nexternal judges. The victorious team\nwas chosen to compete and two runners up representing Imperial as judg-es.\nFor next year\u2019s competition in Chennai (India) the Debating Society will\nagain hold open trials for anyone to\ncompete for an opportunity to represent Imperial and they say they are\nencourage new people to \u201chave a go\u201d\nat debating.\nDebating Society President, James\nClough, who along with Ed Middleton\nmade up the other half of the Imperial\nteam at the WUDC, had never debated before he came to university.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to new\npeople competing in debating for a\nchance to represent Imperial in next\nyear\u2019s WUDC competition and at\nother competitions closer to home,\u201d\nhe said.\n\u201cI think I can safely say that all of us\nhad an excellent week in Berlin and are\nalready looking forward to next year\u201d\nThere was also of course a social element to the event, with a lot of what\nNiall Jeffrey gets arguing with everyone in sight at the World\nUniversities Debating Championships\nhas been described as international\n\u201cnetworking\u201d. The competition, lasting from December until January, gave\nall present the chance to celebrate the\nNew Year in the manner expected of\n1000 university students.\nFor more information about starting\ndebating you can email debate@impe-rial.ac.uk.\nF\nI did NOT have\nsexual relations\nwith that woman\nPlato: legend\nof debating, as\nwell as beard\ngrowing\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28 FRIDAY 11 JANUARY\nThe best films from the 1970s\nJohn Park Film Editor\n10. Dog Day Afternoon (1975)\nSidney Lumet\u2019s seemingly small but\nperfectly formed bank-heist-gone-wrong drama is unpredictable, com-plex, and oddly touching, featuring\nAl Pacino at his usual best intensity,\nleading the sweaty, claustrophobic\nrobbery, with John Cazale pitching\nin for an excellent supporting turn in\nhis far too brief career. What should\nhave been a quick and easy job develops into a deadly hostage crisis, eventually leading up to an insane media\nfrenzy that can be swayed in the most\nalarming ways. \u201cAttica! Attica! Attica!\u201d is the \ufb01lm\u2019s \ufb01ery highlight.\n9. The Sting (1973)\nIt\u2019s the ultimate stylish feel-good\nmovie in which the good guys get everything they deserve through a clever\nset of tricks. Having a duo as likable\nand good-looking as Paul Newman\nand Robert Redford, paired up here\nagain for the second time after Butch\nCassidy and the Sundance Kid, helps\nimmensely when selling a story this\nsugar-coated and cheerful, and its\ncatchy soundtrack also does wonders\nto uplift the jolly mood. The twists\nand turns are smart, and the end result tremendously rewarding. Best\nPicture winner? Absolutely..\nRecently, the British Film Institute\n(BFI) released the results of their\ncelebrated poll, \u201cTHE GREATEST\nFILMS OF ALL TIME\u201d, in which they\nsurveyed \ufb01lm critics and directors to\nlist their ten favourite \ufb01lms. Now the\nFelix Film team, as much as we\u2019d love\nto, doesn\u2019t have that kind of time or\nresources. And so we decided to split\nthe \ufb01lms up according to the decades\nin which they were released. So every\nweek, we will present you with our\ntop \ufb01lms of each decade.\n8. The Exorcist (1973)\nAn un\ufb02inching, brutally shocking \ufb01lm\nthat had audience members fainting\nworldwide, its widespread ban goes to\nshow just how much of a scandal this\ncaused. Linda Blair (voiced by Mercedes McCambridge during her demonic possession) is even to this day\nthe scariest in a long line of demented\npsychotic children in cinema, the blinkand-you\u2019ll-miss \ufb02ashes of the demon\u2019s\nface is a terrifying series of tricks, and\nEllen Burstyn\u2019s performance is one\nborn out of sheer terror. Plus who can\nforget that horrendously e\ufb00ective mu-sic? Approach with caution.\n7. Apocalypse Now (1979)\nThe \u201cmaking-of\u201d story is as famous\nas the \ufb01lm itself, and this lengthy\nepic of a war story successfully recreates all the horrors one would expect to see. Also present is Marlon\nBrando\u2019s cameo appearance to wrap\nup one of the most unforgettable\nwar movies ever made. The Redux\nversion? There\u2019s an hour of extra\nfootage; some say it slows down the\npace, others say it further enriches\nthe masterpiece \u2013 you\u2019ll have to be\nthe one to decide. But one thing\u2019s for\ncertain; this is a \ufb01lm to watch many\ntimes over.\n6. Network (1976)\n\u201cI\u2019m as mad as hell and I\u2019m not going to take this anymore!\u201d is a line of\ndialogue that will ring true to many,\nas television news anchor Howard\nBeale\u2019s (Peter Finch) public meltdown is captured on live television.\nAs a ruthless, cutthroat dramatic\nsatire of network broadcasting, here\nis a sharply realised, darkly comic\n\ufb01lm, and Faye Dunaway\u2019s energetic,\nno-nonsense, manipulative, success-driven bitch is a real treat. However,\nthis lost out to Rocky in the 1977 Oscar Best Picture race. We\u2019re as mad as\nhell about that.\n5. Taxi Driver (1976)\nAbout a socially deranged man who\ncan\u2019t sleep, and has far too much\ntime on his hands to ponder in his\ndark thoughts, Robert de Niro\u2019s\nTravis Bickle is a ticking time bomb\nfrom the moment you set eyes on\nhim. Enter an American Presidential hopeful, guns, lots of guns, and\na 12-year-old prostitute (the excellent Jodie Foster in her child actress\ndays), then you have a recipe that\nsets up for a bloody finish; which is\ndoes, and in the graphically shocking yet classy and rather affectionate way.\n4. One Flew over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest (1975)\nOppression, struggle for freedom,\nrevolution, a full-on war all feature in\nMilos Forman\u2018s remarkable down-to-earth, human drama set in an insane\nasylum. The cheeky yet intelligent and\ninspirational Jack Nicholson faces o\ufb00\nwith the abusive (both physically and\npsychologically) Louise Fletcher, who\nboth justly won their acting Oscars for\ntheir exceptional performances. The\n\ufb01lm\u2019s power fails to waver even to this\nday, well over thirty years after its re-lease, and it\u2019s the second of three \ufb01lms\nto sweep the Big Five at the Oscars.\n3. The Deer Hunter (1978)\nIts butt-numbing running-time, as\nwell as its blatantly skewed, one-sided look at the Vietnam War have\ngathered up a fair share of detrac-tors, but there is no denying that\nMichael Cimino\u2019s e\ufb00ort in the portrayal of three young individuals\nand their harsh experiences in the\nwar is anything but ambitious. The\nyoung cast, who have since become\ncinema\u2019s legends, range from Robert\nde Niro, Christopher Walken and\nMeryl Streep on their absolute best\nform, and its pitch perfect poignant\nending, stirringly beautiful.\n2. Chinatown (1974)\nIt may start o\ufb00 innocently enough,\nbut as more characters are intro-duced, the disturbing, corrupt conspiracy surrounding the control of\nCalifornia\u2019s water and power systems\nare slowly unveiled, as determined\ndetective J. J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson)\nuncovers a string of malicious leads\nthat endangers his life (not to men-tion, getting his nose sliced with a\nbrilliant cameo from the \ufb01lm\u2019s direc-tor, Roman Polanski). In the middle\nof this murky pool is Faye Dunaway\u2019s\nEvelyn Mulwray, a woman with plenty of secrets of her own.\n1.TheGodfather(1972),TheGod-fatherPartII(1974)\nIt makes sense to put \u201cThe Greatest\nFilm Ever Made\u201d and its follow-up\n\u201cThe Greatest Sequel Ever Made\u201d\nside by side, so we can free up a spot\nto squeeze another \ufb01lm into the list,\nas these two epics belong together to\nstand as one sweeping, unique cinematic experience. Never has there\nbeen a more engrossing gangster\n\ufb01lm, where the stakes have been this\nhigh, the characters this intense, and\nits many, many strands, so skilfully\ninterwoven. It\u2019s six hours of pure cinematic genius.\n\n"

Unfortunately our most\nrecent winner Jamie Kirkwood was released in the summer transfer window\non a Bosman free, therefore hopes had\nturned to the latest crop of IC athletes to\nstepuptotheplate.Anddidtheystepup!\nICBC had the quickest female sculler of\nthe day as well as overall 3rd place, 5th\nplace and 8 pennants, unbelievable!\nItwasanabsolutelyfreezingDecember\nday on the Tideway, however the wind\nhad been kind to the rowers and it was\nvery still. One of the very last scullers to\nrace was Georgie Phillips; she had waited\nfor over 500 other scullers to come past\nher before she could start. In her shiny\nnew Fillipi she tanked it down the course\nin stylish fashion, overtaking multiple\nscullers on her way. However despite\nthe excellent row, even Georgie wasn\u2019t\nexpecting to \ufb01nish 105th, be the quickest\nlady of the day and win an IM3 Lightweight pennant to go with it! Even head\nCoach Don McLachlan was left speechless during his speech at the annual dinner later on that evening (more on this\nlater). Well done Georgie!\nClose behind Georgie in the overall\nrankings was Helen Wood, who picked\nup the IM2 pennant and was the second fastest woman of the day. Yet another pennant came in the form of\nMyriam Goudet, ICBC\u2019s latest big deal\nfrom across the channel. Myriam has\nbeenimpressingeveryoneinthepastfew\nmonths, both with her rowing ability and\nthe fact that she understands what the\nhell Paul Jones is talking about. Myriam\nRory Sullivan Sports Writer\npicked up the Elite pennant after an excellent morning\u2019s work.\nOn the Men\u2019s side, the IC-lightweight\nboys have been at it again. Myles Holbrough romped his way to an 11th position overall and picked up the Lightweight IM2 pennant in the process. He\nwas closely followed by Paul Jones, who\nwon the Lightweight IM1 pennant and\n\ufb01nished an excellent 16th overall. Myles\nsaid he was \u2018over the moon\u2019 to beat love\nrival Tom \u2018grim\u2019 Hope, new boy on the\nblock at IC. Despite struggling with illness and the distractions of an undergraduate degree at Roehampton (SO\nMANY PARTIES), Tom still won the\nLightweight Elite Pennant, pipping BadMan Wilf Kimberley by just 1 place over-all.\nAnother girl strutting her stu\ufb00 in a\nnew Fillipi was Cat Buizza. Despite racing with the weight of a hot water bottle\n(to keep warm at the start) Cat managed\nto win the Women\u2019s Novice pennant in\nstyle. The \ufb01nal pennant winner of the day\nwas Hal Bradbury, who was the quickest\nSenior Man.\nAlthough not pennant winners, Henry\nGoodier and Ben Spencer-Jones ensured\nIC again dominated the top-5, coming\n3rd and 5th respectively. They were racing in the extremely tough Novice category(inwhichthey\ufb01nished2ndand3rd)\ndespite Ben burying himself in a helpless\nfellow novice somewhere around the Island. These results are all the more impressive considering both of these chaps\nare sweepers at heart (and Ben not even\nthat!). Ben\u2019s 5th place puts him in a list\nof undisputed IC legends who have also\n\ufb01nished in the most prestigious position at this wonderful head, including\ninternational Boat-Man superstar Sam\nScimgeour, Desert Running nutter JPD\nand of course (otherwise why would I big\nit up) Yours truly.\nIC had so many excellent performances that I haven\u2019t been able to \ufb01t them all\nin so sorry if you haven\u2019t had a shout out,\nnexttimewinapennant!Anyway,almost\nas soon as the last IC sculler had crossed\nthe line, attention turned to the evenings\nfrivolities. The ICBC Annual Dinner was\nheld at the Rembrandt Hotel in Knightsbridge, and it was brilliant. Big shout out\nand well done to Ben, Lily, Sammy C and\nthe rest of the committee (apart from\nme) who did a fantastic job organising it.\nIt was great to see the class of \u201892 at the\ndinner this year, and everyone is looking forward to getting out our shiny new\neight named in their honour. There were\nsome beautiful moments at the dinner,\nmy two personal favourites were Harriet sweeping Myles o\ufb00 his feet and IC\nlegends Andy G and Winnie showing o\ufb00\ntheir shaven legs in Pacha (they are now\ncyclists!).\nICBC are looking forward to 2013 and\nhave already been back training hard.\nNext event is BUCS head in February\nand it is all guns blazing from now until\nthen so we can bring home the bacon.\nVA R S I T Y\nL A U N C H P A R T Y\n17 JANUARY 2013 / 20:00 - 01:00 / METRIC / \u00a32.00Entry\nTHE CLUB WITH THE MOST ATTENDEES WINS THE TAKINGS ON THE DOOR\nR e d & B l u e S O U R Z \u00a3 1 . 1 0 A S H O T\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE IMPERIAL MEDICALS\nWWW.IMPERIAL.AC.UK/SPORTS/VARSITY\n/SPORTIMPERIAL\nimperialcollegeunion.org/whats-on\n\n"

    "content": "What we watched over Christmas\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\nDirector: Ang Lee\nScreenwriters: David Magee,\nYann Martel\nStarring: Suraj Sharma, Irrfan\nKhan and Adil Hussain\nLucy Wiles Film Editor\nFor those of you who have read Yann\nMartel\u2019s Booker prize-winning novel\nLife of Pi, you might have wondered,\nhow on earth this soliloquy was going\nto be transformed into a half decent\n\ufb01lm. The majority of the novel is set\nin a small boat drifting around the\nocean, and relates the thoughts of the\nlead character \u2013 how was that going to\ntranslate successfully into a good \ufb01lm?\nAfter the release of the \ufb01lm\u2019s advert, all\nhope was lost \u2013 3D e\ufb00ects must surely\nbe the focus of the producers, not the\nheart-rending story of the book.\nThis was reckoned, of course, without fabulous director Ang Lee at the\nhelm. Lee\u2019s previous works include\nthe phenomenal Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Sense and Sensibility and,\nmost recently, Brokeback Mountain \u2013\na very quiet \ufb01lm with little dialogue.\nBorn in Taiwan, Lee has established\nhimself over the last few decades as\none of the world\u2019s most versatile, mul-ti-talented directors \u2013 not to mention one of the most successful \u2013 so\njust maybe this could be a winner.\n3D glasses at the ready, thousands of\nviewers have \ufb02ocked to see Life of Pi \u2013\nand have come out glad that they did.\nThe tale begins in the present: a\nCanadian author (who it is assumed\nis Yann Martel, played by Rafe Spall)\ntravels to India to research a book,\nwhere he is told by a friend that there\nis a man back home in Montreal called\nPi (Irrfan Khan), with such a story to\ntell that \u2018it will make you believe in\nGod\u2019. Intrigued, the author locates Pi\n(whose actual name is Piscine Molitor\nPatel), a philosophy teacher, and Pi\nrelates the tale of his incredible life \u2013\nstarting as a zookeeper\u2019s son in Pondicherry, India.\nGrowing up in India, the very serious and inquisitive young Pi (played by\nGautam Belur at \ufb01ve, Ayush Tandon\nat twelve and Suraj Sharma at six-teen) is intrigued by religion and the\nmeaning of life \u2013 a development that\nthe \ufb01lmmakers treated with respectful playfulness as Pi creates a private\nreligion combining Hinduism, Islam\nand Christianity with the beauty of the\nnatural world found on his doorstep in\nthe zoo. But when his father decides to\ntake the animals to Canada to be sold,\nPi despairs and his faith is tested. He\nand his family board a Japanese ship\nwith the animals \u2013 a journey that will\nbe far more thrilling than expected.\nWhen the ship is struck by a gigantic\nstorm in the middle of the ocean, Pi\n\ufb01ghts for his and his family\u2019s lives only\nto \ufb01nd himself captaining a lifeboat\nwith just a zebra, a hyena, a female orangutan and the gigantic Bengal tiger\nnamed Richard Parker for company\n\u2013 watching the wreckage of the ship,\ncrew and his family disappear down\nthe Mariana Trench.\nAnd so starts Pi\u2019s grand adventure.\nThere is no peace and relief of survival\non his little boat \u2013 this is a Darwinian place where animals \ufb01ght for their\nlives. Pi must learn to command the\ncreatures, or die himself. Using 3D\n\ufb01lming at its absolute \ufb01nest (eat your\nheart out James Cameron) and CGI\ncreatures so realistic that you wouldn\u2019t\nbelieve they\u2019re not, Ang Lee and his\nproduction team make it all so horribly real, down to a few terrifying,\npopcorn-\ufb02ying 3D moments. Pi\u2019s 227\ndays at sea test his physical and mental\nstrength (not to mention his faith) and\nthe story is beautifully uplifting and\ncrushingly devastating at the same\ntime. Unfortunately the frustration of\nthe book\u2019s ending is not lost in the \ufb01lm\n\u2013 the crux of which is a question the\nadult Pi asks the author, and the answer he receives.\nAdapted for screenplay by American\nwriter David Magee, the \ufb01lm is an excellent combination of narration and\nmonologue. The young Chilean director of photography, Claudio Miranda,\ncreates unbelievable horror in the\nstorms, and utter beauty in the sparkling \ufb01sh surrounding Pi: Miranda\nmust surely be in line for an award. In\nfact, this is an awards-season movie if\never there was one \u2013 it certainly deserves every technical prize available.\nBut alongside the magni\ufb01cent e\ufb00ects,\nthe story of a young boy bewildered at\nsea is not lost.\n3.141592653589793238462643383279502884\nLife of Pi\nThe Hobbit\nPeter Jackson, after a long, di\ufb03cult\njourney of putting this prequel together with numerous production delays,\nbudget problems and creative di\ufb00erences, \ufb01nally has one-third of it out in\nthe cinemas. His decision to split the\n\ufb01lm into three has not been the most\npopular, and the slow, dragging pace is\ncertainly felt in part one of The Hobbit,\nthis one titled An Unexpected Journey. There is a merry band of dwarves\nwho set out on a quest to reclaim their\nkingdom that has been invaded by an\nangry dragon. The wise wizard Gandalf the Grey enlists the help of Bilbo,\na gentle-natured, home-loving Hobbit,\nin joining their quest.\nOne worries for these men as they\ncan hardly seem to defend themselves\nagainst pretty much anything dark\nthat comes their way, and just how on\nearth they\u2019ll go about tackling a \ufb01rebreathing dragon is anyone\u2019s guess,\nbut for now, here is a beautiful, lengthy\nbut often thrilling view of their Middle\nEarth road trip that even after almost\nthree hours of running time only in\nfact gets them just a couple of thousands of miles away from their actual\ndestination.\nJack Reacher\nTom Cruise steps in to portray the\ncharacter of Jack Reacher, a man of\nmany skills with a mysterious past\nwho suddenly appears to help out an\nold acquaintance who has been accused of senselessly murdering \ufb01ve\nseemingly unconnected, innocent\npeople on a regular day. All the incriminating evidence points towards\na certain James Barr and as more\nis revealed, his lawyer Helen Rodin\n(Rosamund Pike) \ufb01nds it increasingly\ndi\ufb03cult to \ufb01nd holes in the story.\nBut being who he is, he comes up\nwith cunning ways to outsmart the\nbad guys, and in the end you know\nwhere the \ufb01lm is headed \u2013 that we see\na completely di\ufb00erent shooter in the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s opening ensures us that the accused is innocent, and it\u2019s really the\nprocess into proving this that the \ufb01lm\nfocuses on.\nIt certainly over-reaches into thinking that it\u2019s dealing with a cleverer,\nbigger plot than it really is, and towards the end, the big reveals aren\u2019t at\nall shocking or in any way smart. But\nthe charming box-o\ufb03ce draw Cruise\nstill appears to have what it takes to\nlead an action picture.\nQuartet\nA less jumbled, funnier, more touching version of 2012\u2019s hit, The Best\nExotic Marigold Hotel, here we have\nthe unrealistically beautiful Beecham House, a retirement home for\nmusicians. Their days are \ufb01lled with\ncharming songs, light and breezy humour and plenty of sunshine that really doesn\u2019t make ageing look so bad.\nEvery year the residents stage a con-cert, the proceeds from which they\nuse to keep their sanctuary running.\nWith tickets more di\ufb03cult to sell,\nthey need something big. And it just\nso happens that there are four of the\ngreatest singers in English operatic\nhistory staying at this place. But with\na chequered past, old age, and the occasional memory lapses, will the four\n(Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Billy\nConnolly, Pauline Collins) be able to\nsave their beloved care home?\nReading the plot may make this\ncome o\ufb00 as a preposterous, sugarcoated nonsense which technically\nthis is. But with a cast this talented\nand an atmosphere this warm and\nfuzzy, it turns into that feel-good \ufb01lm\nyou probably shouldn\u2019t like but do\nanyway.\nThe Impossible\nReese Witherspoon, an Oscar-winner\nherself, sent a fan letter to Naomi\nWatts recently, praising her \u201cbrutal\nphysical performance,\u201d \u201cthe ferocity\nof [her] mothering spirit\u201d and \u201csoul\ntouching moments.\u201d And Ms. Witherspoon is spot-on when describing\nWatts\u2019 contribution to the harrowing,\nunforgettable \ufb01lm based on the 2004\nIndian Ocean tsunami. The last time a\nfamous actor (Julia Roberts) endorsed\nsomeone\u2019s performance (Javier Bardem in Biutiful) so publicly, he ended\nup with a nomination. It\u2019s a safe bet to\nassume the same will deservedly happen for Watts.\nLooking at the \ufb01lm as a whole, it\u2019s\nan incredibly moving story of a family torn apart by this terrible tragedy,\nbruised and battered by unstoppable\nnature, and its equally horri\ufb01c and\nchallenging aftermath. The waves\ncrash-landing have impeccable scale\nand genuine terror, whereas the\nmore human aspects of the drama,\nstrengthened by exceptional performances from its cast \ufb01nd plenty of\npower and genuine emotions despite\nsome rare but probably unavoidable\nmissteps into hampering melodrama.\nARGH...salt water on nipples..!\n\n"

As it\u2019s exam\ntime, I\u2019m gonna be light on your mind\nand not hide any secret messages in\nthe article this time (No, really. Go\nand look back at the old article titles\nand \ufb01nd where I\u2019ve hidden the Declaration of Independence). So, here\u2019s a\nlow-down on what you should be paying attention to \u2013 a 2013 menu, if you\nwill. Some things may have gone o\ufb00 by\nthe time they arrive at your table, some\nthings may have been left out for too\nlong, making them bland and\nrubber y,\nwhilst other options may have been\nburnt beyond recognition, leaving a\nhorrible taste in your mouth. Bear\nin mind, I\u2019m only picking out a few\nchoice selections here \u2013 I can\u2019t mention everything that should be a good\nshow. Bon app\u00e9tit.\nProject SHIELD\nHot o\ufb00 the press, is news of Nvidia\u2019s\npet project of 2013 \u2013 Project SHIELD\n\u2013 a handheld console. I can\u2019t fault them\nfor wanting to try; a games-focussed\nhardware giant has a good chance of\nstealing some of the love that sits solely\nwithin the bank accounts of Nintendo.\nYet, the images we\u2019ve seen so far, look\nlike an Alienware-branded console,\nwhich probably doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re\naiming it at the younger audience. One\nproblem I can see, is that the older\naudience that\u2019ll be prime for playing this, already have a variety\nof ways to play games \u2013 from\nfully-\ufb02edged consoles, to smart-phones. Looking back to the\nslow sales of the PS Vita, this\nmight not be the right choice\nfor this normally behind-the-scenes company, but time\nwill tell. As will sales. (As an\naside, I hope this thing has\namazing ventilation \u2013 I\ndon\u2019t like the idea of\nholding a radiator.)\nPaired with SHIELD\nis GRID \u2013 a graphics\ncloud. It\u2019s powerful\non paper, and people\nare touting it as a great\nway to compete with desktop comput-ers, with the ability to stream gameplay\nto handheld devices. Does anyone else\nremember what happened to OnLive,\nor is it just me?\nWatch Dogs\nFirst seen at E3 2012, Watch Dogs is\nan open-world game, set in a world\nslightly more technologically dependent than ours. Gameplay revolves\naround hacking and gadgets, but it still\nkeeps true to the current style of open-world games, incorporating third-per-son shooter elements, along with the\nstealth and parkour aspects of the Assassin\u2019s Creed series. I personally think\nthe game will be quite a hit, probably\nwith a large viral marketing or tech-based advertising scheme. It currently\nlooks as serious a game as GTA4 (ig-noring anything that involved Roman\nand his love of big American tee-tees),\nbut with any luck, there will be the\nopportunity to add some Saint\u2019s Row\nmadness (maybe not going as far as\nWhored mode, but still).\nWasteland 2\nMy \ufb01rst foray into the world of Kickstarter \u2013 Wasteland 2. There\u2019s a bit of\na history here -\u2013Wasteland 2 is the sequel (well, duh-doi) to Wasteland, the\ngrand-father of all post-apocalyptic\nrole-playing games, such as the Fallout\nfranchise. The development team is\nmade up of inXile Entertainment and\nObsidian Entertainment, groups created after the dissolution of the original Fallout development teams, and\nwho are also responsible for the ageless Neverwinter Nights 2 and Fallout:\nNew Vegas. Obsidian Entertainment\nis practically Black Isle Studios 2.0 \u2013\nBlack Isle Studios was responsible for\nFallout 2. Considering their creden-tials, and the progress we\u2019ve already\nseen, Wasteland 2 should be great \u2013 a\nharkening back to the olden days of\nthe role-playing genre. Except\nwith better graphics. And\nprobably more bugs.\nPok\u00e9mon X & Y\nYou can tell what social circles you\u2019re\nin by the number of Facebook posts\nmentioning the reveal of Pok\u00e9mon X &\nY on your feed. Everyone\u2019s so excited,\nit\u2019s as if they\u2019ve seen an Oasis vending\nmachine in the middle of the desert,\ndespite the latest Pok\u00e9mon games\ncoming out less than three months\nago. I watched the CES reveal and to\nbe honest, these editions do look good.\nThe 3DS and its offspring seem ideal\nfor the first handheld 3d Pok\u00e9mon\nforay and to be fair, there\u2019s a predicted\nworldwide release (in other words, we\nall get the game at the same time) for\nOctober this year, so there\u2019s plenty of\ntime to fill up that Pok\u00e9dex with *flips\npages* the 649 current Pok\u00e9mon. I feel\nold.\nStar Wars 1313\nI loved Star Wars Bounty Hunter. That\nfeeling of being the bad-ass Jango Fett,\nand \ufb02ying throughout the galaxy to\ncapture your unwitting targets was\ngreat. Star Wars 1313 is a return to bounty-hunting\nbad-assery, now set during the rise of the Galactic\nEmpire. You\u2019re going to be\nhunting your prey on\nLevel 1313 of Coruscant, so be\nprepared\nW\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\n32\nControverZ\nIt\u2019s not exactly a secret that I\u2019m a fan\nof zombie games. From fully-\ufb02edged\nteam-based games such as Left 4 Dead,\nto mods such as No More Room in Hell\nand DayZ. If you\u2019ve been around this\ngenre before, you\u2019ll notice that it nearly\nalways takes place in the ruins of cities\nand towns. It makes sense, to be honest\n\u2013 it allows for a more varied playground\nof zombie-killing madness. DayZ took\nadvantage of a massive piece of coun-tryside, and made it lonely and brutal.\nAnd best-selling. Well, it\u2019s free, so it\u2019d\nbe best-selling if you could actually sell\nit. Another group \ufb01nally noticed this\nchasm in the market, and promised us\nThe War Z. The one thing that smelled\n\ufb01shy to the o\ufb03ce, was that it quickly\npopped up on our radar, months after\nDayZ started building momentum, and\nless than a year later, The War Z was up\non Steam. And now we know how.\nDespiteeveryonepayingfullpriceand\nthe developers stating wonderful facts\nabout the game, the whole thing was in\nan alpha-stage (to put it nicely). In other\nwords, The War Z team lied to get more\nsales. Steam pulled the software from\ntheir store and allowed refunds (a rare\noccurrence within the Steam o\ufb03ces).\nLabelling itself \u201cThe World\u2019s First\nSurvival MMO Zombie Game\u201d The\nWar Z gives (well, gave) gamers a mul-ti-environment open-world zombie\nslaughter-fest. Now, lots of games will\nfall under the wheels of the gaming\ntrain each year. (A new year, and I\u2019m already creating horrible analogies). Unfavourable reviews, broken gameplay,\nbad advertising \u2013 all routes to the bargain bin. None are as heinous, however,\nas bad PR. Upon the murmurings of\ndissension within the community, the\ndevelopers replied with \u2018If you don\u2019t like\nthe game, it\u2019s not our fault. If you followed the the game\u2019s description, word-for-word, then you took us too literally.\n\u2018 (not their exact words, but you\u2019ve got\nthe jist).\nNeedless to say, unhappy customers\nensued and the aggressive stance of the\ndevelopers did nothing to help.

    "content": "Return of the Master\nShiladitya Ghosh talks about Clive Cussler\u2019s fantastic new novel\nhe 22nd novel in a series\npenned by \u201cthe guy I read\u201d\n\u2013 Tom Clancy, Poseidon\u2019s\nArrow has it all \u2013 from\nexplosions, chase scenes,\nand bare-armed combat, to snappy\nwitticisms, spunky damsels in dis-tress, and a (literally) earth-moving\nplot. Clive Cussler, respectfully and\ndeservingly famed as the \u2018Grandmaster of adventure\u2019, together with his son,\nDirk, yet again weaves science, tech-nology, politics, history, and geography into a thrilling tapestry of action\nand adventure spanning the breadth\nof the globe.\nIn this episode (though that term\nis a superb understatement given the\nmagnitude and scale of the plot) set\nin 2014, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino\nfrom the U.S. National Underwater\nand Maritime Agency (NUMA) are\n\ufb01nally, after 21 books, getting on in\nyears. However, after the U.S. Navy\u2019s\ntop-secret revolutionary brainchild\u2019s\nproduction schedule goes awry as a\nresult of a suspiciously coincidental\ncrippling of the world\u2019s production\nof rare earth elements, mysterious\ndeaths at sea caused by a hitherto unknown and undetectable weapon, and\nthe sudden disappearance of a scientist potentially responsible for deciding the balance of power in the world\u2019s\nseas for decades into the future, the\nfantastic duo get back to investigating the murky waters for clues linking\nthese incidents \u2013 and unearth a conspiracy more complex than what anyone would have bargained for.\nEven the most ardent of Cussler\u2019s\nfans (and there are a great many)\nwould have to accept that each book\ncannot possibly keep being better\nthan the last, and this is one of the few\noccasions where this might be true \u2013\nbut this is attributable to the high storytelling standards the Grandmaster\nhas established for himself from the\nstart. After the initial excitement of\nbeginning another Pitt adventure set-tles, the plot starts to become slightly\npredictable (but only if one has read\na sizeable amount of the rest of the\nseries). This, in addition to perhaps\na smaller-than-expected dose of historical linkage and a frugal serving of\nexplanations and details of up-and-coming technological concepts leads\none to wonder if perhaps the book will\nturn out to be a let-down.\nHowever, the tongue-in-cheek, met-aphor-laden, and outright audaciously\nwitty dialogue and banter, coupled\nwith the transitioning of character\nroles (Dirk Pitt Sr. and Al Giordino\nslowly starting to make way for Dirk\nPitt Jr. and Summer Pitt in the lime-light) allow for forgiveness in this pivotal part of the series. Perhaps not the\nbest book to start with for readers new\nto the series, but certainly an important read for any fan of Dirk Pitt Sr.\nFor us here at Imperial, it may be a\ncommon sentiment that there is simply no time to read for leisure (or even\nfor study, depending on your course);\nhowever it is this reviewer\u2019s opinion\nthat reading Cussler\u2019s works, such as\nPoseidon\u2019s Arrow, can allow us to kill\ntwo birds with one stone: \ufb01rstly by allowing us a (perhaps ill-fated) break\nfrom workaholicism and secondly,\ngiving us an awareness of how our\nSTEM/Medical education can get\n(mis)treated out in the real world, in\naddition to seeing how much value\nour potential output can have. Perhaps\nsome of us aren\u2019t concerned about\nthat and just want to graduate and\nstart work, but there are also many\nwho wish to appreciate what they can\ndo in the future using their degree-related knowledge, and the potential\nconsequences and impacts that may\narise \u2013 and for these people, Cussler\u2019s\nliterature is surely an appealing literary supplement to following the news\nor reading dry journal expos\u00e9s.\nThis reviewer recommends Cussler\u2019s Atlantis Found, Fire Ice, Dark\nWatch, Black Wind, and Arctic Drift.\nT\nThe Book of the New Sun is universally\nacclaimed as a speculative \ufb01ction\nclassic, with its author, Gene Wolfe,\nhaving been recently awarded the\ntitle of Grand Master of the genre.\nHowever, seeing how it comes in at\n1200 pages, I have never really had the\ntime to read it. Finding myself with\nrelatively little to do over the winter\nbreak I decided to rectify this mistake\n\u2013 something that I\u2019ve not come to regret doing.\nThe book is set in the distant fu-ture, with the sun having started to\ncool and Urth, as Earth has become\nknown, having regressed from being the centre of a great interstellar\nempire to an almost medieval soci-ety. The novel begins with Severian,\na journeyman of the Order for the\nSeekers of Truth and Penitence, or,\nas it is better known by the common\npeople, the Order of Torturers, being\nexiled for showing mercy to one of\nthe Order\u2019s \u2018clients\u2019. He is left to travel\nthe world, encountering remnants\nof more prosperous times, as well as\ncoming upon plans to restore humanity to its former glory.\nThe story is told in \ufb01rst person by\nSeverian himself. He has a highly\nengaging voice but is also prone to\ngoing o\ufb00 on tangents \u2013 this is not a\nbook for those who like stories told\nin a concise and linear fashion. These\ntangents, however, are, for me, one\nof the great attractions of the novel.\nThey serve not only to provide more\ninsight into the character of Severian\nbut also help to develop the world the\nstory is set in.\nIt is in the world building that this\nbook really shines. Wolfe has created a truly unique environment \u2013 a\nworld were ordinary people live in\nfeudal squalor but mix with alien\nvisitors. Where almost all the natural resources have been depleted but\npeople continue to use energy weapons and other advances technology\nfrom earlier ages. Where giant sea\nmonsters enslave entire nations so\nthat their citizens are only permitted\nto speak in sentences taken from approved propaganda texts.\nIt soon becomes clear that, in many\nways, it is Urth itself that is our protagonist \u2013 with Severian acting as a\nchronicler of its fate. Wolfe, however,\ndoesn\u2019t fall into the trap of revealing\ntoo much \u2013 even by the end there are\nstill many things that are left unclear\nor unexplained. We are told everything that is essential but by not getting bogged down in details we maintain the sense of wonder, which we\nmight have otherwise lost as a result\nof overfamiliarity.\nThis is a truly excellent novel and\nwell deserving of the praise it has re-ceived. While its length and some of\nits quirks mean that it might not be to\neveryone\u2019s taste it\u2019s still worth at least\ntrying it out.\nEarth\u2019s not doing so well.\nA Journey to Earth\u2019s Distant Future\nMaciej Matuszewski Books Editor\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\n24\n\n"

On Mars?\nars One is a notfor-pro\ufb01t organisation planning to\nuse money donated\nfrom sponsors and\nthat generated from a reality TV show\n\u2018media storm\u2019 to fund a project that\nwill put a human habitat on Mars in\n2023. In the \ufb01rst half of this year the\napplication process will open to applications for their astronaut training\nprogram, which itself will be \ufb01lmed\nand broadcast as part of the TV show.\nMars One claim to have already received over 1000 emails expressing\ninterest in signing up for the project,\nregardless of the catch: the trip to\nMars will be one way.\nWith the goal of reducing\nthe costs of funding such\na project the outgoing\nastronauts will live\nand die on Mars. The\norganisation has not\nruled out the possibility that a return\ntrip may become\nfeasible at some\npoint in the future,\nbut for the moment\nthe trip remains one way.\nThis means that the habitats\non Mars will have to be self-sustaining, with planned hydroponic\nfarming and water and oxygen extraction from the soil being essential for\nthe astronauts\u2019 survival.\nThe habitats, components,\nand other essentials for\nthe settlement will\nbe transported\nand set up in\nvarious stag-es, with the\nmajority of\npreparations\ntaking place\nbefore the astronauts reach\nMars. The organisation will send\na communications\nsatellite, necessary for\nbeaming the live feeds of the habitat\nback to Earth for the television show,\nwhilst also allowing communication\n\u201c\u201dbetween the settlers and people back\non Earth. Shipments and rovers will\nalso be sent over, with the rovers \ufb01nding the best place for habitation, then\nmoving the supplies there and setting\nup the base of the human settlement,\nready for the astronauts.\nOnce the astronauts arrive they will\nhave to make some \ufb01nal adjustments\nto the habitat, maybe dust o\ufb00 some solar cells and then they will be ready to\nmove in and be watched by the world.\nSome components and supplies will\narrive on Mars shortly after the arrival of the astronauts and, after this\ninitial batch, new astronauts, supplies\nand components will arrive every two\nyears, expanding the habitat further.\nAll of this process will be televised\n24/7/365, from the astronaut training\nprogram to a live-feed from the rovers\non Mars; even the historic moment\nof the \ufb01rst person to set foot on Mars\nwill be captured for the viewing pub-lic. As be\ufb01ts a reality TV show public interaction will also play a part in\nthe show, with the public being able\nto choose which team of 4 will be the\n\ufb01rst to be sent to Mars. That is, if the\nproject ever gets there.\nThere are many dangers that will be\nfaced by a project such as this. There\ncould be any number of technical\nproblems that simply couldn\u2019t be \ufb01xed\nby a normal person, or even disasters\nthat could kill all of the crew. There\u2019s\nalso a danger that funds could dry\nup if the project\u2019s media storm didn\u2019t\nsustain momentum, leaving the astronauts abandoned on Mars.\nThe website for the project addresses some of these issues, such as\nthe plan to cover the habitats on Mars\nwith soil, reducing radiation received\nby the people whilst on Mars. The\nshielding of the main capsule of the\nspacecraft for periods of violent solar\nactivity is another plan to reduce the\nrisk to the astronauts from radiation.\nThis gives me hope that the project\nteam have at least some idea of the\ndangers and that the project could actually achieve its goal.\nThe project, if successful, would be a\ntestament to human ingenuity, paving\nthe way for likeminded projects, and\nwho knows what projects like these\ncould end up achieving. Maybe one of\nthem will even manage to solve some\nof our problems down here on Earth.\nThe major issue faced is how people\nwill be evicted from the show\ntech.co\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\n\u201c\u201d\nWe can only\nlive in hope\nthat it doesn\u2019t\nturn out like\nJersey Shore.\nReality TV fan?

More\naccurately, it speci\ufb01cally targets and\nkills neuroendocrine tumours (NETs),\ncancers arising from the hormonal\n(endocrine) and the nervous systems.\nHowever, lack of funding means that\nthe virus remains untested in humans.\nWhat would this mean for potential\nsponsors?

Coupled with the di\ufb03culty of\nvirus modi\ufb01cation and the requirement\nfor the virus to destroy every cancer\ncell whilst not killing your own results\nin a cancer therapy sponsors shy away\nfrom.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\n30\n2013 January Preview: f\nThe New Year is here \u2013 which can only\nmean one thing: the exciting, glittery\nOscar season is well under way. Films\nthat carry their studios\u2019 high expectations are rolled out in late December\nover in the States, which means over\nhere in England, we see their releases\nthroughout January. Sick of feeling\ndown and gloomy with the January\nblues? Felix Film takes a look at the\nexcellent \ufb01lms on o\ufb00er that should be\nworth your while.\nGangster Squad (10th January):\nWhat should have been released in\nNovember is \ufb01nally getting its push\nin January, although any Oscar buzz\nhas suddenly died down and been silenced thanks to that lone gunman in\nArizona. The studio rushed to take\nits trailer down, which featured a\nscene in which a group of men shoot\nthrough a cinema screen with machine guns, probably killing everyone in the cinema, not the message\nthey want to be selling so soon after\nthe actual real-life tragedy. Hasty re-shoots were commissioned, and there\nis very slim chance we will actually\nget to see that footage.\nBut here is a potentially interesting\ncop vs. gangster scenario. Sean Penn\nis the notorious mob boss terroris-ing his city, Josh Brolin is tasked with\nleading a bunch of men into taking\nthis man down; and the fun twist being that the \u201cgood guys\u201d aren\u2019t strictly\ncops. They are allowed to bend the\nrules and often break the law, in order\nto complete their one-way mission.\nOf course, there needs to be a seductive woman involved, and here it\u2019s\nEmma Stone who steals the heart of\nRyan Gosling. She\u2019s trapped in a love-less, frightening relationship with the\nbad guy, looking for a way out with\nthe good guy.\nNo points for originality then; but it\ndoes sound fun with an ace cast who\nconsistently bring their A-game. Bullets will \ufb02y, heads will roll, men will\nget laid, and things will explode (this\nisn\u2019t a sex joke, so behave).\nLes Mis\u00e9rables (11th January):\nTom \u201cshould-give-his-Best-Director-Oscar-to-David-Fincher\u201d Hooper (The\nKing\u2019s Speech) and the cast are mighty proud of their unique musical achieve-ment. Basically, everyone does their own singing, and what you see on the\nscreen is the actors actually doing the live singing. No miming involved what-soever. It adds intensity, and raw emotions. Anne Hathaway certainly seems to\nbe the front-runner to pick up the Best Supporting Actress Oscar (or a nomination at least) for her heart-wrenchingly beautiful and intense interpretation of\n\u2018I Dreamed a Dream\u2019 e\ufb00ectively erasing Susan Boyle from everyone\u2019s memory.\nYes, this further enhances depth and sense of struggle (just listen to the cast\ntrying to get the top notes: it\u2019s one bloody messy struggle, perfectly mirroring\nthe massacre and body count that follow) in the already overwrought, heavily\nsaturated musical, which may be why this is racking up the nominations in\npretty much every single award ceremony. There are sensational crowd reactions all over the world, with some cinema audiences literally rising up on their\nfeet to applaud.\nBut the fact remains, the cast is largely made up of professional actors, not\nsingers. And it certainly shows in their scratchy voices and often uncomfortable vocals that never sit quite right. Hugh Jackman (as much as we down here\nat Felix drool over the talented Australian) almost ruins the \ufb01lm\u2019s most beloved\nsolo, Russell Crowe is unintentionally hilarious whenever he opens his mouth\nto sing, Amanda Seyfried\u2019s weedy soprano voice doesn\u2019t do much to add passion to her romance, Helena Bonham Carter who sounds bored only scarcely\nimpresses in what should have been juicy comedy scenes, and it\u2019s really the supporting players hired for their stage credit, Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit,\nwho shine.\nIt\u2019s certainly a \ufb01lm to watch for its scale and intensity, but not for listening to\nthe sensational tunes. The cast can\u2019t even come even close to\u2026say\u2026the West\nEnd cast on a dodgy day. Adjust your expectations, sit back, relax, and be bombarded with 150+ minutes of never-ending sentiment and passion.\nDjango Unchained (18th January):\nFinancially speaking, this is set to become Quentin Tarantino\u2019s highest grossing \ufb01lm yet, and is also his best reviewed since Pulp Fiction.\nTeamed up once again with Christoph Waltz (the man who played the excellent Nazi Colonel Hans Landa in Tarantino\u2019s previous Inglourious Basterds),\nthe unique director now tackles the spaghetti western genre, without failing to\nadd his very own special touches of sensibly over-the-top chaos and mayhem,\ngraphic violence, snarky humour, and outrageous one-liners and an astonishingly well-assembled cast that consists of Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio and\nthe Tarantino-favourite, Samuel L. Jackson.\nIt\u2019s a revenge road-trip with slick gun\ufb01ghts, as a slave-turned-bounty-hunter\n(Foxx), with the valuable help from his mentor (Waltz), tracks down his wife\n(Kerry Washington) who has been kidnapped by a merciless Southern plantation owner (DiCaprio \u2013 will he or won\u2019t he get the Best Supporting Actor nod?).\nTarantino has very rarely, if ever, set a foot wrong in bringing his ideas to the\nbig screen, and although an acquired taste, he never lets his fans down, a reliable director who always promises to bring something fresh and original to the\ntable, and he certainly seems to achieve that here.\nYour ciggy is the\nwrong way round bro\nThat\u2019s where the creepy\nguy from Level 2 of the\nLibrary went\nLes Miserable indeed\nCowboy hats are so in\n\n"

During her\ntime she has campaigned for open access to knowledge and says \u201cI am cautiously optimistic about the prospects\nfor more open access provision over\nthe next \ufb01ve years. In 20 years\u2019 time I\nthink the model will be turned on its\nhead \u2013 I\u2019m not sure quite how, but the\nlandscape will look very di\ufb00erent\u201d.\nShe said that she will miss the working environment and praised her colleagues saying that she has \u201clearned a\nlot and watched some very clever peo-action.\nThe backlash to the decision has\nbeen remarkable. The \u2018Save Charing\nCross\u2019 campaign stated how the NHS\nignored 66,000 signatures of residents\non 18 petitions. Patient Donald GrayRaus said: \u201cI am appalled by the idea\nof closure of the A&E department at\nCharing Cross Hospital. I am severely\ndisabled and the thought of not having\neasy access to a hospital may be fatal\nto me. Hammersmith & Fulham is too\nlarge an area to be without a well-run\ncentrally located A&E department.\u201d\nCouncillor Nicholas Botterill, Leader of H&F Council, said: \u201cWe are\ndeeply upset at the result. The NHS\nconsultation was appalling and the\nservice level left available to residents\nis appalling. This is bad news but there\nare options available to us and we are\ndetermined to see a hospital retained\nat Charing Cross.\u201d\nThe main worry is that the initial\nclosure of the A&E department and\nstroke unit of Charing Cross hospital\nwill lead onto the eventual closure of\nthe hospital itself. Another worry is\nthe increase in ambulance journey\ntimes to a predicted 53 minutes, which\ncould potential endanger lives. Residents are not satis\ufb01ed with the idea\nof the remaining A&E departments\naccommodating for 400,000 people\nwhich is around 50% more than the\nnational average.\nCouncillor Marcus Ginn, community care leader, said: \u201cWe have been\nwarning of the threat to Charing Cross\nhospital for many months and this\ncon\ufb01rms out worst fears.\n\u201cOver many months of questioning\non this, NHS bureaucrats have failed\nto address concerns that this will leave\nthousands of residents dangerously\ndistant from emergency care or to\nshow that lives will not be put at risk\nby these closures.\n\u201cWe will be \ufb01ghting tooth and nail\nto save Charing Cross \u2013 the public are\nnot going to accept this plan quietly,\nespecially when the case for stripping\nall the major service out of such a well\nloved and respected centre of excellence is not supported by evidence.\n\u201cThey have not taken account of the\nthousands on new homes being built\nin west London which will mean we\nneed more local access to hospitals,\nnot less.\n\u201cWe have warned them not to go\ndown this path. The public reaction is\ngoing to be immense.\u201d\nThe reasons behind these changes\nhave been linked with the massive\n\u00a31.8 billion de\ufb01cit that the NHS North\nWest London is trying to deal with. If\nthe Charing Cross Hospital A&E department is closed there will be a lot\nmore space for residential re-develop-ment which the Imperial College NHS\nTrust could sell for a large amount of\nmoney.\nHowever, Anne Rainsberry, NHS\nNW London chief executive, said:\n\u201cThe main proposal is to transform the\ncare provided in local communities.\nMore care should be delivered closer\nto home. And by also centralizing\nsome specialist hospital-based ser-vices, the NHS can ensure that people\ncan bene\ufb01t from receiving treatment\nat centres of best practice and excel-lence.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about cutting corners or\ngetting by with the bare minimum. We\nwant to change the way we deliver care\nso that outcomes are improved, both\nin terms of clinical outcomes and patient and sta\ufb00 experiences.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used robust clinical evidence\nto set targets, and clinicians have set\nout the standards by which we can\nmeasure our performance against\nthem.\u201d\nThe downgrade of Charing Cross\nHospital threatens the future of the\nhospital as the teaching site for Imperial College students.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\nfor your consideration...\nThe Sessions (18th January):\nIt\u2019s a romantic comedy about sex, but probably not the kind you\u2019re thinking\nabout.\nIn a bold move to portray sex as something that\u2019s not a trivial, drunken con-quest, it rather sensitively approaches the theme with warmth and dignity.\nFor an intelligent 38-year-old journalist con\ufb01ned to an iron lung, it\u2019s Mark\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s (John Hawkes) curiosity that leads to his search for a sex surrogate.\nHe wants to lose his virginity. He wants to know what sexual intercourse consists of. Enter Cheryl (Helen Hunt), a sex therapist with whom Mark can have\na restricted number of six educational sessions. The two are not there to fall in\nlove, they are to merely explore their bodies, Cheryl is to teach Mark about the\nvarious senses in his body, to have him control them in intimate moments to\nultimately engage in sex when the time comes with another person.\nUsing the character Cheryl, who is given a never-ending supply of warmth\nand compassion in Hunt\u2019s terri\ufb01c performance, the \ufb01lm carefully explores\nMark, his condition, and his past, to paint a fuller picture into his life, never\npatronisingly dismissing him as just another disabled Hollywood stereotype.\nCritics and voters are clearly loving Hawkes and Hunt, as nominations\nare \ufb02ooding in for the pair\u2019s brave portrayals of their challenging roles, with\nHawkes only able to use the expressions of his face to fully engage with the\naudience. It\u2019s a humble o\ufb00ering but a more than satisfying one, in which gentle\nbursts of both laughs and tears will come and go.\nLincoln (25th January):\nA \ufb01lm that is as informative as it is entertaining, Steven Spielberg turns a potentially dull and dry topic into a fascinating, surprisingly humourous account\nof how the 16th President of the United States worked his power to pass the\n13th Amendment, abolishing slavery.\nSet during the American Civil War that is proving to be incredibly unpopular\nas well as costing countless lives, Lincoln needs enough votes, from both his\nown and opposing parties to push through his addition to the United States\nConstitution. Cunning lobbying is required, as well as careful handholding of\nvarious party members to ensure support.\nOne of the most dedicated method actors working today, Daniel Day-Lewis,\nembodies the role of a calm, collected and softly-spoken President, whereas\nSally Field, with as much energy and guts she has always possessed in her \ufb01ery\nperformances in the past, is as astounding as Mary Todd, Lincoln\u2019s wife.\nIt covers a lot of ground \u2013 ranging from various political gatherings in the\nHouse of Representatives, delving into the grizzly battle\ufb01elds, serving as the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s opening, as well as showing the more domestic, family-oriented side to\nhis Presidency.\nZero Dark Thirty (25th January):\nForget the non-sense controversy stirred up by paranoid politicians and naive individuals who seem to believe that America doesn\u2019t use torture. Kathryn\nBigelow\u2019s gripping retelling of the 10-year manhunt and the eventual fall of\nOsama Bin Laden may not have everything 100% accurate (very few \ufb01lms can\nactually claim to be just that), but the condensed material is a meticulously\nstructured, impeccably detailed, large scale procedural with a riveting performance from its lead, the ever-so versatile Jessica Chastain. The 10-year hunt\ntakes a toll and forces Maya (Chastain) to sacri\ufb01ce a lot, and it\u2019s shown in her\nraw, uninhibited performance of sheer realism. The \ufb01lm is more interested in\nthe personal angle of the story, rather than taking a bigger, over-reaching political stance, and is more triumphant because of it.\nA political thriller to blow \u201cArgo\u201d out of the water, it cleverly integrates several real-life events such as its harrowing opening of a completely blank screen\nonly playing audiotapes of various victims of 9/11, and the 7/7 London bombing\nto push the narrative forward, and even at 157 minutes there isn\u2019t a \ufb01lm more\nconsistently exciting throughout. And with a memorable \ufb01nal parting shot, the\n\ufb01lm isn\u2019t afraid of directly asking the audience, was all of this worth it?\nWon\u2019t Back Down (25th January):\nSo this isn\u2019t actually even in close\nrange to the Oscar race, since the\nreviews in the States were so disappointing back in September, but for\nanyone looking for an easy-going,\nfeel-good movie of two women defying the odds and beating the big bad\nboys\u2019 bureaucracy club, this is the\n\ufb01lm for you.\nAs usual, Maggie Gyllenhaal and\nViola Davis are inspirational as they\nstand together to reform the education system that is failing their\nchildren. The system can fail, but a\nparent can\u2019t \u2013 says the \ufb01lm\u2019s tagline\nand from that you can deduce what a\nsimplistic, feel-good \ufb01lm this will be.\nLack of heavy-hitting drama despite\nits given subject matter that could\nspark a debate for hours on end, the\nchances are, you will be disappointed,\nand this one is for fans of the excellent\nactresses only.\nMovie 43 (25th January):\nDe\ufb01nitely has nothing to do with the\nOscars. This is the de\ufb01nition of an\nanti-Oscar \ufb01lm. A crude, o\ufb00ensive\ncomedy that sets out to insult every-one, instead of vying for awards glory,\nhere\u2019s something to make you laugh,\nand something to make you feel guilty\nevery time you burst uncontrollably\ninto \ufb01ts of laughter.\nSad because he\nlost his top hap\nThe moment\nwhen the brain\nwave hits her:\nlet\u2019s look in his\nhouse\n\n"

After around\n10 minutes the fellow passengers, all\ninebriated males, started eve-teasing\nand passing lewd comments at the\ngirl. When her boy friend objected, a\nscu\ufb04e ensued with the men beating\nhim up with iron rods. While two of\nthem held on to the boy, the others\ntook turns at raping the girl. They\nthen assaulted the girl by inserting a\nmetal rod into her body and causing\nirreparable damage to her intestines.\nBoth of them were then dumped on\na deserted road near the outskirts of\nthe city.\nBy the 21st of December, the rape\nhad caught the public imagination\nleading to a mass protest at India\nGate and Raisana Hill, the location\nof the Union Parliament and the\nresidence of the President. Relatively\npeaceful earlier on, events took a turn\nfor the worse with the government\nemploying tear gas, lathi charges and\nanti-terrorism laws to breakup the\nprotests. Several metro stations and\npublic transport services were also\nshut down for a few day. Subsequent\nclashes with the police lead to injuries\non both sides with a policeman dying\nfrom cardiac arrest at the protest site.\nMeanwhile the victim was being\ntreated at a hospital in Delhi and\nremained in critical condition due to\ndamage and infection in her intestines\nthat had to be resected. On the 26th\nof December, the government, based\non a cabinet meeting headed by the\nPM, moved the victim to Mt. Mary\nHospital in Singapore for an intestinal\ntransplant. This decision to move\nthe patient while on life support was\ncriticized heavily in the media leading\nto more protests, which had by now\nspread to other major cities in the\ncountry. On the 29th of December,\nthe victim succumbed to her injuries\nand died of cerebral edema.\nSo far 6 men have been arrested\nin connection with the vehicle,\nincluding a 17 year old minor who\nis alleged to have been the most\nbrutal of the accused, raping her\ntwice and ripping her intestines out\nwith his bare hands. After the death\nof the victim, murder charges were\nadded to the other charges of rape,\nkidnapping, destruction of evidence\nand attempted murder. These charges\nmean that the accused stand eligible\nto receive the death penalty if found\nguilty.\nTaking cognisance of the protestors\u2019\ndemands for harsher rape laws and\nsterner action against sex o\ufb00enders\nseveral state assemblies have tabled\namendments in state laws and\nenforced measures such as the\ncreation of a dedicated help-line for\nsexual abuse victims, and six \u201cfasttrack courts\u201d to deal with crimes\nagainst women.\nThese protests come on the heels of\nother protests against the beleaguered\ncentral government, which has been\nthe target of several protests over the\nlast 18 months against corruption.\nThe heavy-handed reaction of the\ngovernment and the absence of any\nearly sympathetic response to the\nprotesters are likely causes for the\nrapid intensi\ufb01cation of the protests.\nThe outpouring of public anger in the\ncities is seen as a result of a rapidly\ngrowing middle class revolting\nagainst a misogynist and conservative\nculture. Fundamentalist political\nO\nDevang Mehta Writer\nProtest, Unrest and Social Upheaval in New Delhi\nReuters\nTragedy sparks debate over attitudes to women\nparties were quick to blame the rape\non the westernization of Indian\nwomen and these reactions appear to\nhave spurred the protests yet further.\nItisnow63yearssinceIndiaadopted\na constitution promising democracy,\njustice and equality of religion, race,\ncaste, sex and place of birth, and yet\nits justice system remains plagued\nwith widespread corruption among\nthe police and judicial o\ufb03cers. Police\no\ufb03cers are often seen as oppressors\nof the general public and guardians of\nthe ruling political class. Notorious for\nbeing un-safe for women, the capital\nNew Delhi was recently branded the\n\u2018rape capital\u2019 of the country by its\nown Chief Minister. Crimes against\nwomen appear in the newspapers\nwith frightening regularity and\ninclude rape, dowry related abuse,\nmarital abuse and eve teasing. Police\n\ufb01gures show a rape reported on\naverage every 18 hours and reported\nrape cases rose by nearly 17 percent\nbetween 2007 and 2011.\nIt is in this environment that a fast-growing educated middle class, at war\nwith a patriarchal and male chauvinist\ntradition, has seized the brutal gang-rape and murder of a young student\nto raise awareness and international\nattention to India\u2019s \u2018rape problem\u2019.\nWith statements from UN Secretary\nGeneral Ban Ki Moon and the\ngovernments of France, the USA and\nothers, the issue has certainly gained\ninternational notoriety; whether this\nresults in any real legal and societal\nprogress in the country remains to be\nseen.\n63 years since India adopted\na constitution promising\ndemocracy, justice and\nequality of religion, race,\ncaste, sex and place of birth...\nits justice system remains\nplagued with widespread\ncorruption...\nPolitics Pr\u00e9cis\nPadraic Calpin\nKey Stories from the Holiday Season\nItalian Elections Heat Up\nOn the 9th of December Mario Monti,\nItaly\u2019s \u201ctechnocrat\u201d leader, stepped\ndown amid a boycott by Berlusconi\u2019s\nFreedom People party over budget\ndecisions. Appointed after Berlusconi\nlost his parliamentary majority and\nresigned amongst personal scandals,\nMonti\u2019s government was tasked with\nbalancing Italy\u2019s books before stepping\ndown this April; his early resignation has\npushed the Italian elections forward to\nFebruary..\nSilvio Berlusconi had already\nconfirmed his intention to run for a\nfourth term in upcoming elections,\nbut it remained uncertain what Monti\nwould do; this was mirrored in the\nmarkets, with fears over Italy becoming\n\u201cthe detonator that could blow up the\neurozone\u201d.\nNow it\u2019s been announced that Monti\nwill run supported by a coalition of\ncentrist parties under the name \u201cMonti\u2019s\nAgenda for Italy\u201d, though as a result of\nhis austerity policies the group currently\ntrail far behind Pier Bersani\u2019s centre-left\nDemocratic Party.\nSyria Conflict Deepens\nThe Syrian conflict remains decidedly\nunresolved, now being deemed an all\nout civil war. Recent estimates from the\nUN have put the total death toll from the\nconflict at 60,000 since it began some 22\nmonths ago, as much as half of which are\nestimated to be civilian deaths. Ten times\nas many people are now registered as\nrefugees in neighbouring countries.\nMany cities such as Aleppo and\nHoms remain the site of intense\nfighting between government forces\nand the increasingly internationally\naccepted National Coalition of Syrian\nRevolutionary and Opposition Forces.\nHowever the vast majority of the capital,\nDamascus, is still held by forces loyal\nto Bashar Al-Assad, save the suburb of\nDouma held by rebels since October\n18th.\nEurope Debate Rolls On\nHere in the UK, debate over the\ncountry\u2019s role in the European Union\nand single-market has continued at a\nlow key rumble. David Cameron is due\nto announce his \u2018action plan\u2019 on Europe\nin weeks. But he has been warned by\nvarious figures including the Obama\nAdministration that withdrawal\nwould risk damaging the UK\u2019s political\nsignificance and economic power. An In/\nOut referendem seems unlikely, but it\u2019s\npossible Britain will push to renegotiate\nit\u2019s \u201crole\u201d within the union.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\n18\nRory Fenton\nReligion for Atheists\nn atheist church\u201d\nI repeated the sentence a few times to\nmyself while making\nmy way along Islington\u2019s St Paul\u2019s road on Sunday morn-ing. St Paul\u2019s famous road to Damascus led him to found Christian\ncommunities but this St Paul\u2019s road\nwas taking me to a whole new concept of human community: an atheist\nchurch. As in, a church for atheists.\nCould this work? Did it even make any\nsense? I wasn\u2019t sure. But I was keen to\n\ufb01nd out.\nI was on my way to the \ufb01rst ever\nmeeting of The Sunday Assembly, the\nbrainchild of comedians Sanderson\nJones and Pippa Evans. Formed under\nthe motto of \u201clive better, help often,\nwonder more\u201d, the monthly meetings\naim, in the words of Jones, to give\nLondon atheists \u201call the things that\nare good about bringing a community\ntogether and make us better people,\njust without God being involved\u201d. The\ngroup have no problem with borrowing directly from religion, the services\nthemselves are held in an old, decon-secrated church.\nBut Sanderson and Pippa aren\u2019t the\n\ufb01rst people to have this idea, although\nthey seem to be the \ufb01rst to put it into\npractice in London. The thought of\ncreating a religion-like community of\natheists, agnostics, humanists etc. has\nbeen a hot topic of discussion since\nAlain de Button published his book\nReligion for Atheists almost exactly a\nyear ago. De Button argued that rather than shun everything with a \u201creligion\u201d label, non-believers should look\nat where religion did get it right, including in building community, providing perspective, realising our human \ufb02aws and giving us a focus for art\nand architecture. It is the \ufb01rst of these,\nbuilding community, that the Sunday\nAssembly chie\ufb02y targets.\nThe idea is pretty controversial with\nmany atheists. Some can\u2019t see there\nbeing anything worth learning from\nreligion. After all, if it\u2019s based on a\nfalse premise, how could a religion get\nanything right? And doesn\u2019t the idea\nof an atheist church open up the nonreligious to the age-old accusation of\n\u201cyou\u2019re really just another type of religion\u201d? I decided to withhold my judgment and see for myself what this type\nof atheist community would look like.\nSo up St Paul\u2019s Road I went\u2026\nThe building itself was indeed a\nstereotypical Church of England\nstone house of worship, now used as\na Steiner school. Having grown up\nCatholic I\u2019m pretty used to church\nA\nRory Fenton shares him impressions from the first meeting of The\nSunday Assembly, London\u2019s new \u2018atheist church\u2019\nbuildings but many atheists, especially those from religious but non-Christian backgrounds, may \ufb01nd this\no\ufb00-putting. But I quickly stopped\nthinking about that, because the big\nnews of this Sunday Assembly became immediately clear as I walked in\n\u2013 the idea is incredibly popular. With\n\ufb01ve minutes to go before show time,\nthe place was completely packed with\nabout 200 people. I was just about able\nto grab a child\u2019s stool at the back (as in\na stool meant for children, I wouldn\u2019t\nsteal from a child; not unless they had\nit coming) and a minute later heard\nhalf panicked, half jubilant commands\nto open up the choir balcony to accommodate even more people. By the\ntime the meeting started, there were\nstill a good 30 people either sat on the\n\ufb02oor or standing at the sides.\nSo it seemed I wasn\u2019t the only one\ncurious to see this idea in action. The\nservice itself lasted just over an hour\nand was, again, very much in\ufb02uenced\nby Christian services. It had much of\nthe format of an evangelical service\nwith sermons sandwiched between\nhymns. Yep \u2013 sermons and hymns.\nSo what is an atheist sermon? Well it\u2019s\nvery funny, or at least these ones were.\nSince the Sunday Assembly\u2019s founders\nare comedians, their sermons felt very\nmuch like a stand-up gig. The event is\ncompered by the messianic-ly bearded\nSanderson Jones who introduced the\nwhole idea behind the project and was\ngenerally very funny. There was also a\nguest speaker, this week\u2019s being children\u2019s author Andy Stanton. I can\u2019t say\nI got too much from Andy\u2019s speech.\nThere was a general atmosphere in\nthe church of the organisers being\nvery keen not to seem \u201cpreachy\u201d but\nwhat that meant with Andy was that\ninstead of giving his words of wisdom\non \u201cbeginnings\u201d, supposedly re\ufb02ecting\non how he became an author, he just\nmade a lot of self-deprecating jokes\ninterspersed with pauses that felt a\nbit too long to be intentional. That\nsaid, the idea of an atheist (or perhaps\nmore precisely a humanist) \u2018sermon\u2019\nis far from a crazy one. Humanists\nadmire great scientists, philosophers\nand poets and a sermon based around\ntheir works and a secular theme like\n\u2018wonder\u2019 or \u2018relationships\u2019 is perfectly\nreasonable, in the understanding that\nthese are just words of advice intended to provoke personal re\ufb02ection.\nPippa\u2019s stand-up style talk about not\nsweating the little stu\ufb00 was a nice example of this. So atheist sermons get\na thumbs up.\nAnd an atheist hymn? This Sunday\u2019s hymns were \u2018Don\u2019t Look Back in\nAnger\u2019 and \u2018Build Me Up Buttercup\u2019.\nThey even had a live band and lyrics\non a projector screen. Hey, I\u2019m cool\nwith this too. As a Catholic I played\nin a church group and quite miss this.\nSongs are always full of messages\nabout life, why not enjoy them togeth-er? Convincing a room of Londoners\nwho don\u2019t know each other to sing together is a whole other story. I don\u2019t\nreckon anymore than 20% of us had\nthe gall to join in, but maybe that\u2019ll\nimprove with time. I like this idea \u2013\natheist hymns also get a thumbs up.\nAnd then came the prayer stu\ufb00. OK\nnot actual prayers, since no deity was\ninvoked, but some very prayery stu\ufb00.\nA \u2018moment of silent re\ufb02ection\u2019 was encouraged which made me, and I imagine others, feel pretty uncomfortable.\nNot so much because I didn\u2019t like the\nre\ufb02ection thing, mind. When my family prays before meals I don\u2019t join in\nbut I do try to remind myself that I\u2019m\npretty lucky to have food and should\nbe glad of this fact, even if I\u2019ve no god\nto thank. So I do see how atheists can\nuse moments of quiet re\ufb02ection in\ntheir lives. But to see this form a part\nof the atheist church service made me\npretty uncomfortable, quite probably\nbecause it just felt so religious. Perhaps I should just get over this, but\nthe Sunday Assembly need to remember that many attendees may have had\nuncomfortable religious experience\nin the past, making organized silence\nchallenging.\nBut the silent re\ufb02ection was a little\nmore prayery than mere silence. Being January, the service\u2019s theme was\naround beginning new things and\nresolutions. In our silence, we were\nencouraged to think about something\nwe want to change in our lives and\nhow great that would feel to achieve.\nWe were told that scientists have\nshown that just by saying something\nout loud, our brains will believe it is\ntrue. Now I am all for encouraging\n\u201c\nIt had much\nof the format\nof an evangelical service\nwith sermons\nsandwiched\nbetween\nhymns. Yep \u2013\nsermons and\nhymns.\n\u201c The Sunday Assembly focuses\non building community in the\nsame way that religions do,\nbut without including God\n\n"

The team met at\n7am at Baron\u2019s Court tube and began\nthe long tube journey to Oakwood for\ntheir home competition, by the time\nwe got to the stables the sun had risen\nand the snow was beginning to melt,\nbut the team was not looking forwards\nto plaiting and grooming horses in the\nfreezing cold!\nOn arrival at the stables we were\ngreeted by a decorated Christmas tree\nand Christmas carols which instantly\nbrightened our mood, and after a quick\nbrie\ufb01ng by Captain Rachel the team\nbegan cleaning the horses and plaiting\ntheir manes and tails to hopefully win\nbrownie points with the judge! Due to\nthe snow, Kent were running late, but\nwe managed to do the draw and start\nthe competition nearly on time, despite\nit taking half an hour to \ufb01nd the dressage boards that had gone missing at\nthe centre.\nThe scoring in the BUCS equestrian\ncompetitions is complicated \u2013 the\nrider who does the best dressage test\nor show-jumping round on each horse\nscores 0 and then the di\ufb00erence between the other riders score and the\nbest score on that horse is their score\nas a penalty, i.e. 0 is the best. The dressage tests are scored out of 250 points,\nand the show-jumping out of 210, and\nscores in both phases generally range\nfrom 55% to 80%.\nClaudia Saksida rode her horse, Kaliber, a dark bay gelding who was replacing our \ufb01rst choice horse Samba,\nbecause he had pulled a muscle, really well despite his di\ufb03cult nature and\ncomplete lack of interest in dressage,\nand she scored 16 penalties after the\ndressage phase. Andre Wilmes rode\nsecond on his horse, Jay, an experienced\nchestnut gelding and rode a masterclass\nof a test to win on his horse and score\n0 penalties. Rachel Gregory was third\non her horse, Franklyn, a chestnut geld-ing, and rode a neat and accurate test to\nscore 1 penalty and Liane Marshallsay\nwas last on her horse, Galileo, a big palomino gelding, and her test was beautiful to score 3 penalties\nAt lunchtime after the dressage Imperial were in second place behind the\nUniversity of Kent, who were in the lead\nby 19 points after they managed to win\non three of the horses! Royal Holloway\nwere in third and LSE in fourth. Lunchtime saw frantic course building and\ntacking up of the show-jumping horses.\nSome of the teams were surprised at\nhow big the show-jumping course was\n(we built it as big as we could!) but after\nthe course walk everybody was happy\nand the competition got underway.\nImperial had again been drawn as\nteam four, which meant that Claudia\nwas again the \ufb01rst Imperial competi-tor. Claudia was riding Monsoon, a\ntricky dark bay gelding, but she jumped\na tidy round but had an unfortunate\npole down, leaving her on 3 penalties\nRachel Gregory Riding Captain\n\u201cLean on me...\u201d\nonce all four riders on her horse had\ncompleted. Liane was second on her\nhorse Teak, and had a pole down and\na run out (when the horse doesn\u2019t jump\nthe jump so you have to do a circle and\njump it again) and was given 16 penal-ties. Rachel was third on Freddie, a bay\ngelding, and she jumped a stylish clear\nround to be judged the best rider on\nher horse, giving her a score of 0. After\na nervy few minutes when two riders\nfrom LSE fell o\ufb00 in the warm up, Andre was the last to ride on his horse,\nLucy, a big bay mare. He also jumped a\nstylish clear round to be given the best\njumping score of the day and win on his\nhorse, scoring 0 penalties.\nThe \ufb01nal results revealed that the Imperial team had taken advantage of the\nhome competition and won by a narrow margin of ten points. University\nof Kent were second, Royal Holloway\nthird and LSE were fourth. Andre won\nindividually and Rachel was second. After the \ufb01rst two mini-league competitions Imperial are top of the league.\nA huge thank you goes to all the helpers on the day, without whom the competition would not have run as smoothly as it did!\nAsyougazeacrosstheverdantgreenery\nof the unbroken grass \ufb01eld, a coursing\nvibration climbs up your legs, building\nrapidly until suddenly 8 horses burst\ninto your vision. 32 bandaged pony\nlegs \ufb02ashing bright colours as they\nthunder past; players calling loudly to\none another as they jostle and \ufb01ght to\nmake a play on the tiny, white ball; the\ndistinctive \u2018click\u2019 as a long mallet, bent\nat a seemingly impossible angle, connects and send the ball soaring a hundred metres or more towards a goal o\ufb00\nin the distance. This is the spectacle of\npolo and words, much like television\ndon\u2019t really do it justice. TV has been\nthe downfall of many sports over the\nyears; it\u2019s pretty tough to televise something on a pitch the size of 9 football\npitches where the players move at 30\nmiles an hour and the solid ball, barely\nbigger than a tennis ball, can move at\nwell over 110mph.\nIn some respects this is a great shame;\nit\u2019s high time that some of the more\nobscure sports and those that have a\nreputation for exclusivity are thrown\ninto the limelight. I\u2019ve always said that\nany sport that involves riding around\nfar too fast and whacking things with\na mallet is a game that was designed\nmore for chavs than the aristocracy, so\nit\u2019s about time it shook it\u2019s elitist stereo-type. Still, polo is guilty of failing to entice new players and fans. You\u2019d think\na high speed, contact sport, played on\nbeautiful grounds, on beautiful ani-mals, wouldn\u2019t have trouble attracting\npeople to watch. But to the outsider the\nrules of polo are about as unintelligible\nas my degree is to me. But polo isn\u2019t, es-sentially, a complicated a\ufb00air; you and\nyour three team mates just have to hit\na ball in the goal more times than your\nopponents do.\nUnfortunately, from there it does get\na bit more complicated. With a total of\n48 legs between horses and riders, 8\nmallets 1 ball and 8 brains on the pitch\n(players de\ufb01nitely don\u2019t have brains)\nthere\u2019s too much potential for catastrophe not to have a few rules. With this\nin mind, almost every rule is designed\nwith the safety of either the player or,\nmore often, the horses in mind. For ex-ample, the most common foul in polo,\nand the biggest thing to learn, is known\nas crossing the right of way. In more\ncomprehensible terms, it means you\ncan\u2019t get in the bloody way of a horse\nbarrelling along after the ball! The rule\nis in place to ensure that there aren\u2019t\ncollisions between horses, something\nthat could be extremely dangerous\nwhether you\u2019re four legged or two, and\nit also sets up most of the tactics of the\ngame.\nKnowing that no one can come in\nfront of you means that, with clever\nplay (something that players seldom\nachieve), you can control who is in a\nposition to mount a defence or make\nany play at the ball. Equally crucial is\nthe fact that it\u2019s illegal to reach over or\nacross any other players pony, for obvious reasons, and the only contact allowed is to come shoulder to shoulder\nwith another player and push him or\nher sideways \u2013 though mallets can also\ncome into contact with one another to\nspoil players\u2019 shots. With all this going\non it\u2019s a wonder that players ever get\na chance to hit the ball, but hit it they\ndo. Even with the short 7 to 7 and a half\nminute periods of play (normally 4 or 6\nto a match), designed to protect ponies\nthat have to work \ufb02at out for that time,\nscores can quickly get into the double\n\ufb01gures.\nWith bangs and crashes, long hits,\nspectacular goals, falls, rears, thrills\nand spills it\u2019s easy to see why those\nthat enjoy the sport are so passionate\nabout it. It\u2019s not in any way a gentlemanly a\ufb00air played only by princes.\nCompetitively, it\u2019s a high-speed, high-adrenaline showcase of skill and courage where horsepower (*pony-power*)\nstill reigns supreme. It ranks up there in\nterms of dangerous sports, but oddly,\nit\u2019s the professionals in the most dan-ger; to those trying it for the \ufb01rst time,\nor playing it at a low level, the speeds\nand risks are much reduced. And in the\nwinter game of arena polo, in a smaller\nenclosed space with an in\ufb02atable leather ball, things can be even more frantic\nwith still lower risks. Admittedly, I may\nbe biased, but if you want to have a look\nfor yourself and form your own opinion\u2026 or even hop on a horse and give\nit a go; polo@imperial.ac.uk are waiting eagerly to hear from you whether\nyou\u2019re a polo pro or a complete pony\nvirgin.\nAlex Savell Polo Chair\nFelix Sport catches up with Riding and Polo on just what makes them love their sport so much\n\n"

The court can be assembled at the drop of a hat (well\u2026\nwithin three weeks) at whatever location the owner fancies. Which means\nthat he can perfect his backhand on\npalm tree-lined beaches, practise his\nreverse-drive on top of the Sydney\nOpera House, and delight the crowds\nin St. Peter\u2019s Square\u2026\nBut wait. Imperial\u2019s three squash\ncourts are neither glass nor portable, so\nhow is it that I know about, and indeed\ndream of, portable glass squash courts?\nWell simply because I\u2019ve seen one. The\nATCO PSA World Squash Finals 2013\nwere played on one of these unusual,\ntransparent, spectator courts, assembled at the elite Queen\u2019s Club in South\nWest London. A handful of members\nof Imperial College\u2019s own squash club,\nled by Jackie Ho, were lucky enough to\nwitness an evening of incomparable\nentertainment. Tennis fans who tire of\nwatching their compatriots losing at\nearly stages should certainly consider\ndefecting to squash. No fewer than 3\nout of 8 men\u2019s contestants, including\nthe World Numbers 1 and 2, were English and in the ladies\u2019 draw there was an\nall English semi-\ufb01nal; as a nation, we\nare a very good at squash. As are Egypt,\nwho had the most players in the draw,\nand whose charismatic Amr Shabana\nwalked o\ufb00 with the men\u2019s title.\nThe standard of squash was, needless to say, fantastic. The ladies\u2019 number 1, Malaysian Nicol David, \ufb02oated\nacross the court in a beautiful white\ndress disposing of her opponent with\ngrace and ease. The men\u2019s games were\nfought with speed, determination and\na touch of drama \u2013 part of Nick Matthew\u2019s handle fell o\ufb00 his racket midpoint and all the players were at some\npoint discontented with an umpire\u2019s\ndecision. These human machines were\nexerting themselves to the limits and\nconsequently, the court \ufb02oor had to be\nmopped at regular intervals because it\nwas so sweaty.\nI think all spectators who attended\nthis brilliant event will agree with me\non the following two points: a) watching squash can be even more draining\nthan playing and you must remember\nto breathe, especially during long rallys.\nSquash\u2019s day out with the Pros\nStephanie Walton Sports Writer\nMuch like Leonidas and his 300 Spartans, Sat 3rd November found me\nleading 10 Imperial hurlers. This time\nhowever the hammer would fall, not\nin Thermopylae, but in Birmingham.\nSame di\ufb00erence some would say. The\nchallenge facing us was very much as\ndaunting. Our titanic adversaries were\nUniversity of Dundee, Robert Gordon\nUniversity (Aberdeen) and University\nof Liverpool.\nFirst game de\ufb01nitely put the wind up\nus. We were ten sheets to the breeze\nand two men down from the minimum\nrequirement (13; i.e. 11+2 = 13). Luckily our brethren from County Kilburn\ncame up trumps and facilitated us fan-tastically; \ufb01xing two \ufb01ne fellas for our\nforce. Sean and Luke they claimed their\nnames were. We were sceptical but\nbought it for the time being. Making\nup the numbers, we descended onto\nthe pitch and gave the attending crowd\n(estimates were from between 3 to\n35,000) an outstanding display of sweet\nhurling skill in a rather haphazard and\ngarish warm-up. I skipped the warm\nup, and went out for the \u2018toss\u2019 with the\n\u2018ref\u2019. I won with an outstandingly delicious call of \u2018heads\u2019. I elected to play\nwith the wind, a decidedly handsome\ncall, as in any hurling game the wind,\nthat \ufb02owing channel of atmosphere,\noften plays a surreptitious and provocative role. Unfortunately it made little\nor no di\ufb00erence to our performance.\nAn awe-inspiring and beautiful display\nof hurling (by Imperial) saw us trail by\nthe slim margin of 8 points to nil in the\n\ufb01rst half. The team talk was tricky but\nusing some sad rubbish I downloaded\nfrom \u2018The Internet\u2019 I managed to corral the lads and convince them to stay\nawake for the second half. \u201cJob done\u201d, I\nsmirked as we embarked back out onto\nthe pitch for the second half. And as if\nby miracle or something, my half-time\nmutterings were paying o\ufb00. Big style.\nWe had scored a point! An excellent\nmove involving most of the team resulted in new star signing \u201cSe\u00e1n\u201d from\nKilburn \ufb02ashing over a gorgeous point.\nWe all cheered. Imbued by this arrogant display of class Imperial surged\nforward and managed to only lose the\ngame by 21 points. Hurling\u2019s like that\nmy old dad would say. One minute you\nhave it, then its gone. No big deal. No\nsense in boiling your cabbage twice\nhe\u2019d also say, so yeah, ya know yourself.\nWe decamped to the dressing room\nin preparation for our next game\nagainst the team representing University of Liverpool. Whilst in the dressing room I had a cheese sandwich. I\u2019m\nsure someone else had a wrap. One of\nthe lads was even meditating under a\nsteady stream of cold water from the\nshower. The level of zen and calm in\nthe room was palpable, as was the stale\nsmell of drink and the peaky hungover\nfaces. A lethal, and winning combination I sco\ufb00ed.\nAfter our 30-minute break I rounded\nup the troops and told them \u2018to give it\na lash this time now lads like, thanks\u2019.\nAnd they did just that. Once again I\nheroically won the toss, sticking with\nmy secret formula. The lads gave another expert display with the warm\nup. You could have melted butter o\ufb00\nthose pulsing legs. Staring down the\ntremendously ugly opposition we let\nrip in what was to be our most success-Hurlers Retain Title (Almost)\nMitch Cuddihy Sports Writer\nful encounter. We hurled well until half\ntime and arrived only 1-0 to 0-1 down,\nhaving pointed a well earned free. The\ncheers were embarrassing but de\ufb01nitely arousing. A short recess and another\nboring team talk and we were back on\nthe pitch. I think most of the lads had a\ndrink of water aswell.\nI felt we really did ourselves justice in\nthe second half. A great passage of play\nculminated in Tipp All-Star Darragh\nRyan being pulled down in the box, resulting in a free. I \ufb02u\ufb00ed the 21 metre\nfree but luckily it sailed over the bar\nso we got to leave the pitch with two\nwhole points, which I was very happy\nwith. Whereas the \ufb01rst result may be\ncompared to a heavy smacking this one\nwas more comparable to a playful bit\nof slap and tickle, so nothing to moan\nabout like.\nContemplating the game with the\nend of my cheese sandwich, I really felt\nthat I could relate to the old Irish saying \u201cdon\u2019t give cherries to pigs\u201d.\nFinal game of the group stages was\nagainst none other than \u2013 Robert\nGordon University. I told the lads that\nAberdeen hasn\u2019t a great record in the\nChampions League so therefore I felt\nsupremely con\ufb01dent that we\u2019d do well.\nThis game was to be our last but by\nGod we gave it everything we had, including the kitchen. Aberdeen turned\nout to be a decent out\ufb01t and we had a\nvery enjoyable game of hurling. Our\nAll-Star and player of the tournament\ncame up trumps with a devastatingly\nscrumptious goal. We lost, but not\nby much, which made for an inspiring\ntrend considering our limited prepara-tion.\nRather like General Custard and his\nlast stand, Leonidas and his issues with\nthe Persians, I proudly lead a beaten\nbut cheerful Imperial College Hurling\nteam home after the Aberdeen match.\nThere were no tails between any of our\nlegs.\nIn one serious paragraph, I would\nlike to mention a couple of things.\nThanks a million to the Union for the\nlend of the bus, thanks to Warwickshire GAA for hosting the event \u2013 they\nare credit to the GAA massive, as are\nthe troopers at the British Universities GAA, mighty men so they are. It is\nwith such unswerving dedication and\ncommitment that the proud Irish traditions have not faltered, in well over\n100 years.\nMy advice to next years hurling team:\ndon\u2019t be afraid to tie your haystacks\ndown when the wind is blowing.\nMay the cabbage always rise with you\nand your family.\nIC Squash in action....one day\nWinning smiles all round\nb) squash thoroughly deserves to become an Olympic sport. Not only does\nit require energy, skill, stamina and inspiration but it is also an exhilarating\ngame to watch. And it should bring\nBritain both medals and glory. Here\u2019s\nto the Olympic Committee coming to\ntheir senses in time for 2020!\n\n"

If you want to slash the caloricious content of\nyour food but not the scrumptiousness then throw out your old \u2018thou shalt not eat\u2019 New Year\u2019s resolution \u2013 armed with this week\u2019s helpful\nissue you\u2019ll see that you can still enjoy your breakfast, lunch and dinner guilt-free.\nThis recipe can be made in a matter of minutes and it always tastes great \u2013 all you need is a blender. Why add other vegtables\nto the soup, like carrots or peppers and add that to the soup?\nIngredients (serves 2)\nA few cups of boiled water\n2 cups of frozen peas\n1 onion\nA blob of butter\n\u00bd an organic vegetable stock cube\n6 mint leaves\nPepper to taste\nA Light Lunch of Pea Soup\nPancakes are great because they are really quick to make and great fun. Here\u2019s a\nrecipe for a great healthy and filling start to the day.\nIngredients (makes 6)\n70g of plain flour\n1 egg\n100ml of milk mixed with 40ml water\nButter or vegetable/ sunflower oil for\nfrying\n2 tbsp of yoghurt\n1 tbsp of honey\nA handful of strawberries, raspberries\nand blueberries\nPreparation\nSift the flour into a mixing bowl. Add\nthe egg and whisk it in. Slowly add\nthe milk and water mixture and whisk\nuntil they are combined. Mixture too\nliquidy? Add a little more flour if nec-essary. Put your (very) non-stick frying\npan on a high heat and add about half\na teaspoon of oil/ butter \u2013 a little goes\na long way. Add a little ladleful of mixture to the pan and spread it over the\nwhole pan. Wait a couple of minutes\nand flip! Remember that the first pancake is always rubbish \u2013 Delia calls it\na \u2018test\u2019 pancake, so if it\u2019s crap, it\u2019s okay\nbecause Delia says so. Just keep making pancakes until all the mixture is\nused up. Now fill your pancakes with\nthe honey, yoghurt and the fruit. Roll\nthem up and add some more yoghurt\nand fruit to the top.\nVery Berry Breakfast Pancakes\nMy dad gave me Jamie Oliver\u2019s 15 Minute Meals this year. Like the Hairy Dieters (AKA the Hairy Bikers), Jamie\nbelieves anyone can cook and eat great,\nhealthy food. However, Jamie claims\nyou can do it in 15 minutes. Given that\nyou\u2019re not superhuman it may take you\na little longer \u2013 it took me about half an\nhour. In Jamie\u2019s defence, after cooking\nthis meal a couple of times I think could\nget it down to 20 minutes.\nThis is Jamie\u2019s healthy Cajun chicken\nwith sweet potato mash and salsa sal-ad, apparently 651 calories per person,\nwith some bits taken out/added by me.\nIngredients (serves 4)\n1 bag of frozen sweet corn (corn on the\ncob is too much effort)\n1 small bunch of fresh coriander\n1 red chilli\n4 spring onions\n3 ripe tomatoes\n2 limes\nOlive oil\n800g sweet potatoes\nJamie Oliver - Eat your Heart Out\n2 tbsp sweet chilli sauce\n4 x 120g skinless chicken breasts\n1 tbsp Cajun seasoning\nPinch of salt\n4 tbsp natural yoghurt\nNote that I omitted the 1tbsp of po-lenta, 20g feta cheese and 2 rashers of\nsmoked streaky bacon that Jamie includes in his recipe. I couldn\u2019t justify\nbuying them when I was using such a\nsmall amount. I also didn\u2019t use 175g\nokra, mainly because I didn\u2019t know\nwhat it was (it basically looks like a\ncross between a courgette and a cu-cumber), but also because Sainsbury\u2019s\ndidn\u2019t sell it. I added the yoghurt \u2013 trust\nme you\u2019ll need it.\nPreparation\nBoil the kettle with lots of water. On a\nlow heat, cook the bag of sweet corn on\na frying pan with a splash of olive oil \u2013\nJamie, what kind of university student\nowns a griddle pan? Peel the sweet\npotatoes and roughly chop them into\nsmall cubes so they cook quickly. Put\nthe sweet potatoes into a large pan on\na medium heat. Add the water so that it\njust covers the potatoes.\nOn a large sheet of greaseproof paper\ntoss the chicken in the Cajun seasoning\nwith a pinch of salt. Fold over the paper than bash and flatten the chicken to\n1.5cm thick with a rolling pin (or use the\nsweet chilli sauce bottle, if you don\u2019t\nown one).\nAdd the chicken to a non-stick pan\nwith 2 tbsp of olive oil, turning every 3\nor 4 minutes, until golden and cooked\nthrough. Drain the sweet potatoes,\nreturn to the pan and mash with the\nsweet chilli. Put on a very low heat.\nPut the sweet corn in a salad bowl.\nFinely chop the spring onion, coriander\nand chilli, roughly chop the tomatoes\nand add to the sweet corn. Add a pinch\nof salt, the juice of 2 limes and a splash\nof olive oil to the salsa.\nNow serve the Cajun chicken on a\nbed of sweet potato mash with the\nsalsa and yoghurt on the side. Trust me\nyou\u2019ll want the yoghurt. It\u2019s a bit spicy.\nJamie\nJamie\nvs.\nvs.\nMe\nMe\nPreparation\nBoil just over 3 cups of water while\nroughly chopping an onion (it\u2019ll be\nin the food processor in a moment).\nAdd a blob of butter to a saucepan\non medium heat. Once it\u2019s melted\nadd the onion. When browned add\nthe peas, half a vegetable stock cube\nand the water. Add the water so that\nit just covers the peas by about a cm\nor so \u2013 you don\u2019t want it to be too\nwatery. Stir until the stock cube has\ndissolved and the mixture is boiling.\nNow add the mixture to a blender\nand blend! Now return the soup\nto the saucepan and add pepper to\ntaste \u2013 there\u2019s no need to add salt,\nas there\u2019s enough in the stock cube.\nServe in bowls and garnish with mint\nleaves.\n\n"

    "content": "T\nowards the end of \ufb01rst\nterm, an interesting email\narrived in our inbox from\nGod records, a small\n\u201cAustrian label for new\nand experimental music\u201d,\npromoting a Boris Hegenbart release\nwhich includes collaborations with 19\nartists, such as Oren Ambarchi and\nFred Frith. When the promo arrived\nhowever, I found another release they\nhad sent with it to be equally grabbing:\nRde\u010da Raketa\u2019s Wir Werden.\nRde\u010da Raketa\u2019s music is somewhat\ndi\ufb03cult to describe at times, even\nwithin the context of noise. Not to say\nthat this is absolutely groundbreaking\nmaterial or anything, it just doesn\u2019t \ufb01t\nneatly into any box I know of at the\ncurrent moment. The band\u2019s attempt:\n\u201cWir werden deals with the past re-peating, movements and their absence in front of systems appearing to\nbe crumbling, relationships between\nMUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n25\nFRIDAY 11 JANUARY\nAMS album of the week\nBig Boi, or the other guy in OutKast,\nhas always been a bit lost in the shadow\nof Andre 3000. Andre was the crazy ex-perimentalist and Big Boi was just a really\ngood rapper. Big Boi\u2019s excellent debut solo\nalbum, Sir Lucious Left Foot, blurred that\nidea a little. There were big pop hits as well\nas great hip hop tracks. His second album\nsees him taking the experimental crown\nand just running with it. Vicious Lies and\nDangerous Rumours is an incredibly diverse and ultimately very difficult record.\nThe main strength of this album lies in the unusual choice of collaborators.\nAs well as some more obvious guests (Ludacris, Killer Mike, KiD CuDi) we\nare treated to Phantogram, Little Dragon and even Nathan Williams of\nWavves fame. All the collaborators have a real influence on the tracks they\nfeature on and as such, the album has an incredibly diverse range of sounds.\nWe get Big Boi\u2019s standard variety of Southern hip-hop filtered through trip-hop, pop rap and indie rock. It leads to a very interesting listen if not a particularly coherent one.\nThe problem with this is that a lot of the tracks just aren\u2019t good enough. The\nmore standard rap tracks are generally of a much lower standard than you\u2019d\nexpect from a Big Boi album. \u2018She Hates Me\u2019 and \u2018Mama Told Me\u2019 are both\nfantastic but the rest don\u2019t really match expectations. For example, \u2018Thom\nPettie\u2019 sounds great on paper. Little Dragon, Killer Mike and Big Boi on the\nsame track sounds genius, but in reality it\u2019s just a mess. The more unusual\ntracks are just as hit and miss. The Phantogram tracks are all pretty good,\nespecially \u2018CPU\u2019, but the Little Dragon tracks aren\u2019t very engaging. The highlight of the album is definitely the Wavves collaboration. Rap verses over indie rock riffs may not have been top of most people\u2019s Christmas lists but it\nreally works.\nThe biggest issue of all is that this doesn\u2019t sound like a Big Boi album. It\nsounds like a collection of him featuring on other people\u2019s tracks. It\u2019s a real\nshame, because Sir Lucious Left Foot proved he can do it on his own and I\nwas really excited to see him develop. Instead, we got the quite bizarre idea\nof him drowning in a sea of his own collaborators.\nGODrec Present Wir Werden\nRoss Gray explores apocalyptic wastelands through noise\npeople and their inner fears\u201d.\nThat certainly resonates strongly\nwith this album. Both sides are unrelentingly bleak or haunting. The \ufb01rst\nside caught me o\ufb00 guard with \ufb02at\nvocals over soft electronic crackle \u2013\nreminiscent of Alva Noto and Blixa\nBargeld\u2019s ANBB, loading me with\nexpectations of glitch. These were\npromptly smashed. Futiristic, bomb-dropping synths were brie\ufb02y explored\nbefore the noise started really building on itself and drowned out all but a\nglimmer. This technique of having the\nsomewhat blistering, but often somehow ambient, noise with just distinguishable rhythms and notes occurs\nthroughout the album, and is a sure\ufb01re path to catharsis.\nTwo factors that sets Wir Werden\napart relative to a lot of its peers (and I\nfeel \ufb01rmly places it within the European noise sound aesthetic) is its use of\nboth silence and its ability to relent. Silence has been utilised very e\ufb00ectively\nby performers such as Runzelstirn &\nGurgelst\u00f8ck, but usually in a way that\nallows for greater audio shock when\nthe noise returns. Wir Werden manages to pull its intensity down a notch\nat times, with piano echoing around in\nendless space, muted noise, distorted\nfragments of female singing all creating a broken ethereality. Somehow it\nmakes it all the more terrifying.\nThe sheer amount of sonic textures\nexplored within the 40 minutes is\ncertainly not to be sni\ufb00ed at. Rde\u010da\nRaketa appear comfortable in the impression they wish to portray; enough\nso they can snap from soundscape to\nsoundscape very quickly, not allowing\nany one snapshot of the desolate world\nto become boring or repetitive, whilst\nmaintaining a cold, crushing and dark\natmosphere.\nCertainly this is an album I would\nrecommend to any followers of the\nmore experimental or noisy end of\nmusic. As a \ufb01rst foray into this kind\nof thing it would likely be intense,\nbut certainly no Lon Guy. A huge variety of instruments and techniques\nare successfully combined to produce\na staggering myriad of timbres and\nlayers within the sound. If all of their\nreleases can produce as staggeringly\npretentious of a review as this, I shall\nmost assuredly be listening to the upcoming releases by GOD records.\nReturn of The Duke\nThis week, just as all the music journo\u2019s had \ufb01nished having their \u201cwhat\nto look forward to in 2013\u201d articles\npublished, a fuck-o\ufb00 metaphorical anvil fell from the clouds and smashed\nthem to pieces; all of them made irrel-evant. No-one expected David Bowie\nto return with new material; his last\nrelease was a decade ago; he turned 66\nthis week, the day the announcement\nwas made. But by Tuesday morning\nBowie\u2019s \u2018comeback\u2019 was plastered all\nover the press and blaring out of ra-dios.\nThis return to the limelight isn\u2019t\njust in the form of a couple of songs\npushed out to bump up sales of a\nGreatest Hits album (c.f. The Rolling\nStones last year), a whole new album\nis to be released on March 11. The\n\ufb01rst song from this, entitled \u2018Where\nAre We Now?\u2019, was delicately placed\non Bowie\u2019s website at 00:00 08/01/13,\nand subsequently devoured by the in-ternetz. Twitter went mental.\n\u2018Where Are We Now?\u2019 sees Bowies\nin a very re\ufb02ective, melancholy mood\nas he looks back over his long career.\nThe song predominantely looks back\non his time spent in Berlin towards\nthe end of the 1970s; this was a pivotal\nperiod in Bowie\u2019s career. He moved to\nthe then-divided German capital to\nquit his consuming cocaine habit and\nbecome more involved in the Krautrock scene, bearing the likes of Kraftwerk. It was here that Bowie also\nworked with Iggy Pop, with whom\nhe was sharing an apartment, on his\nseminal album The Idiot.\nIn \u2018Where Are We Now?\u2019 his vul-nerable, tremorous vocals begin raw\nand pensive before being elevated by\npainfully sad yet de\ufb01ant piano chords,\nreverb-laden guitar and strings. It re-Simon Hunter Music Editor\nally is a beautiful piece of music and\nalmost feels like a full stop to a career\nspanning half a century. Whether it\nwill prove to be so remains to be seen.\nExpectations for the album entitled The Next Day are understandably high; indeed pre-orders for both\nthe single and album are currently at\nNo. 1 on the iTunes chart. Only time\nwill tell whether the album lives up to\nthe huge promise shown by this \ufb01rst\nrelease, but when Bowie\u2019s at his best\nno-one comes close.\nBig Boi: Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumours\nStuart Masson\n\n"
