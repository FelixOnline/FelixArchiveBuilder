Both teams were\nvery nervous and excited before\nwhat was to be the best match of\nthe season.\nHolloway won the toss and\ntook the first centre pass, but an\ninterception in their circle\ndeprived them of possession and\ntaking an early lead.

The practice on set moves\nreaped rewards and almost all our\ncentre passes were successful. We\neven managed to leave behind our\nusual tendency to have 2 players\ngoing for each ball in our attacking third. The shooting was\nexceptionally accurate, even from\nthe edge of the circle. IC defended\nreally well, never allowing\nHolloway to take advantage of\ntheir 6ft goal shooter with some\ngood interceptions. IC's tight\nmarking forced them to repeatedly infringe the three seconds rule.\nWhen the final whistle was\nblown after 60 minutes, the game\nwas unbelievably drawn at 27\ngoals each. We then picked ourselves up again for a further 5\nminutes each way of extra time.\nStill the teams remained neck and\nneck. It was simply a case of who\nwould have scored last before the\nwhistle went and unfortunately\nluck was on Holloway's side, as\nIC's last 2 shots went into the net\nand bounced back out again. The\nfinal score was 31-30 to Royal\nHolloway.\nIt was a brilliant game and\nneither team deserved to lose. IC\nwould like to thank their crowd of\nsupporters who came to watch the\ngame.

    "content": "Feature\nFables\nRENAISSANCE MAN IS DEAD. Modernity, and\neven more so this era of post-modernity, is fast\nand impatient. Thatcher's Children have a three\nminute attention span and an overwhelming\ndesire to make themselves employable.\nHurtling towards a career, they never pause to\ngain a love of knowledge for its own sake and,\nas the constraints of three-minute television\nexpel meaningful content from our screens, a dedication to special is ation minimise s the\nbreadth and profundity of our education. A lack\nof formal training in other spheres need not\nprove problematic; the truly intelligent ought to\nbe able, if they so desire, to explore other fields\nfor themselves. Too often they do not desire and\nmany even feel contempt for other academic\ndisciplines.\nThis close-mindedness to the potentiality\nof alternative worthwhile experiences should be\nof particular concern to Imperial students. The\ncomforts of academic excellence should be\ntempered by the hole that the absence of half\nthe curriculum leaves in our cultural life. In this\nenvironment the full range of interdisciplinary\ndiscussions is lacking ... debates about the\nmechanisms of consciousness between\nphilosophers and neuro physiologist will never\nbe heard in the JCR. But we should also be wary\nof concentrating too much on the sciences;\nbeliefs in the intrinsic superiority of one's own\ndiscipline are unfounded and idiotic whether\nexpressed by physicists or English students.\nFables about this dedication to a particular conception of the worthwhile abound\nin literature. The obsession of Moliere's Miser\nwith wealth, Dicken's Mr. Squeers with the\ninfliction of cruelty upon youngsters, Osbourne's Jimmy Porter with class origins and Dr.\nFrankenstein with the creation of life are classic\nfor\nexamples. These characters are possessed by a single idea of the worthwhile, whether applied\nmerely to their own lives or to those of everyone\naround them, and even when there is much else\nto commend them we find them unnerving ly unsatisfactory. In general these tales include\ncharacters with a broader outlook which is why\nthe comedies of Ben Jonson stand out by the\nsavagery of his attack upon humanity's shallowness. Unlike Shakespearean romantic\ncomedies Jonson populates his highly satirical\nwork with ignoble characters, most of whom\ndisplay no ability to understand another's conception of the worthwhile.\nfollow societal conventions, dedication to\npolitical schemes, beliefs in religious virtues and\nconcentrations on their professional honour are\nall shown to be shallow when breadth of\nexperience and knowledge are lacking.\nConventionally applauded attributes are\nwarped by their inability to see anything else\nbeyond them. Yet this forceful social commentary is tied to neither the depressive\ncynicism that pervades so much modern work\nnor to the particular nature of his time. The\ncharacter traits he ridicules still exist and the\nmanner in which he does so is surprisingly close\nto modern tastes. The play's power to persuade\nis closely linked to Jonson's comic invention;\nlaughing at the characters that we see how\npathetic they are.\nTime?\nVo/pone is possibly his greatest comedy\nbut the attractive characters in it are only so\nbecause of their corrupt brilliance. An obsession\nwith riches and a corresponding contempt of\nother possible goals dominates the lives of the\nprincipal characters. This single mindedness\nleads them to variously perjure themselves,\ndupe others, disinherit their son and attempt to\nprostitute their wife. It is not just greed which is\ndisplayed in this fashion however. Desires to\nThe subject matter is a temporal and it\nremains a relevant fable for our time. In the\nlight of debates about the breadth of experience\nthat Imperial students acquire, Volpone and so\nmany other works of literature can be\ninterpreted as saying that we should be wary of\nnarrowness of interests as scientists, but also\nthat this is a potential problem for others just as\nmuch as for us.

    "content": "News\nFire\nAlarm\nBY JOHN SINNER\nThe much criticised fire alarm\nsystem in Linstead Hall has\ncome under further scrutiny.\nFalse alarms have occurred with\ntremendous frequency, to such\nan extent that residents now\nappear to be treating the system\nwith disdain.\nIn one 24 hour period alone,\nthe alarms sounded 5 times.\nApparently this was due to the\ninstallation of a new fire warning\nsystem throughout the college.\nThe Linstead system itself\npartially went on-line a month\nago. Since then they have been\nsounding up to three times a week.\nDr Jan Bradley, warden of\nLinstead Hall said in an\ninterview with FELIX that\n\"part of the problem is that\nLinstead is so badly designed\".\nThe new system includes heat\ndetectors in the kitchen and\nsmoke detectors in the corridors.\nIt has been suggested that the\nsystem may be too sophisticated.\nFor example, when people leave\ndoors open, smoke from the\nkitchens drifts around the hall\nand ultimately sets off the\ncorridor alarms.\nDr Bradley went so far as to\ndescribe the new system as\n\"ridiculous\" and cited the lack of\nfaith in the fire alarms as a particular concern. It was, she\nsaid, \" in effect life threatening\nbecause nobody takes it seriously\nanymore.\"\nMeanwhile, Graham Cox,\nImperial College's Fire Officer,\nassured FELIX that the\nproblem was being looked into.\nHe intends to have a meeting\nsoon with Dr Bradley and any\ninterested students to discuss the\nmatter.\nOne possible solution is to\nreplace ionisation smoke\ndetectors with less sensitive\noptical devices in the vulnerable\nareas. Mr Cox said: \"We have to\nfind out the best way how to do\nit without creating any security\nrisks\".\nInternational Fight\nBY RACHEL WALTERS Last Friday's International Night\nwas a sell-out success despite\ninternal bickering in the\nOverseas Students Committee\n(OSC). It had been feared that\nmembers of the Islamic Society\nwould disrupt the cultural show,\nbut the event passed off\npeacefully.\nEarlier in the week, Muslim\nmembers of college had expressed\nconcern over a display by a group\nof Pakistani women students.\nOrganisers of the event were\nconcerned that they would set off\nfire alarms to disrupt the\ntraditional dance. College\nsecurity were on full alert\nthroughout the proceedings.\nThere were further\ndifficulties in the food show: the\nSingaporean and Thai food could\nnot be served because of\nadministrative problems. The addresses of the caterers who\nsupplied the food hadn't been\nwritten correctly, and that this\nmeant that their food could not\nbe used.\nAndreas Mers hin,O SC Chairman, said that he thought\nthe event had been a success: \"I didn't expect it to go so well\".\nHis committee have privately\nexpressed concern over his\nleadership, with criticism\nfocussing on his managerial\nskills.\nHis detractors on the OSC\nadmitted that they hadn't actually expressed their complaints until after the event.\nAlthough they had wanted to\nhold an extraordinary general\nmeeting to discuss the situation,\nthey were unable to get the\nrequired 20% of memberships\nsignatures.\nHi-tech Heist II\nBY ANDREW SMITH The Computer Department has\nagain been struck by a professional gang of thieves, who\nnow appear to steal on order.\nLast Friday an estimated \u00a38,000\nworth of processor and RAM chips were stolen from the\ndepartment, which is still\nrecovering from a previous hit.\nThe processor chips appear\nto have contained about 40\nMegabytes and there is a possibility that electrostatic\ndamage to the PC's and\nMacintoshes could double or\neven treble the repair and\nreplacement bill. Nine computers\nwere made inoperable by the\nraider, but the department hopes\nto have all of them back working\nby today, resulting in only one\nweek of downtime.\nThe criminal activity took\nplace last Friday at around\n3.30pm and was detected by a technician who was working in\nan adjacent office. It is still not\nclear how the intruder managed\nto get into the room which has a sophisticated digitised lock, but\nit is thought that he had been\nthere for at least ten minutes\nbefore being detected.\nMr Jim Murphy, Head of\nComputing Support Group, has\ndescribed the technician as\n'extremely brave'. The staff\nmember approached the suspicious person and escorted him\nto the Security Lodge in Huxley,\nbut while security backup was on\nits way the intruder escaped.\nIt is clear from raids on both\nKing's and UCL that this\nactivity is highly organised,\nusing foreign labour who can\nonly be deported when caught.\nKing's was also hit last weekend,\ndespite prior warnings that they\nwere likely to be targeted. The\npolice have said these criminals\nare prepared to defend themselves if questioned and therefore\nasked the public not to approach\nthem.\nThe computers which were\ndamaged in the attack are mainly\nused by students for projects,\nmany of which are due to be\nfinished in two weeks time. The\ndepartment itself will have to pay\nfor the repair and replacement,\nuntil insurance money arrives. It\nis hoped that inconvenience to\nstudents will be kept to a minimum.\nNews in Brief\nBY LYNN BRAVE Y Southside shop\nIn an apparent change of heart,\nSouthside Shop has reintroduced student discounts.\nThe outlet noted for its\noutrageous prices (where a loaf of\nbread is more expensive than\nthat sold in Harrods) is offering\na10% discount to all Imperial\nCollege students. The offer\napplies, on production of a valid\nUnion Card, to all items except\ntobacco, newspapers, phone\ncards, stamps and items already\non special promotion.\nNew Dean\nA new Dean has been elected for\nthe Royal School Of Mines.\nProfessor RD Rawlings starts\nhis three year post as of 1st September 1995. He replaces the\nincumbent Professor Shaw.\nCivil Servants Served\nThe Management School has\nbeen chosen as a provider of the\nnew Public Sector MBA launched last week by Robert\nHughes, Junior Public Service\nMinister. The MBA will provide\na broad yet dedicated resource to\nthe future leaders of the UK' s Civil Service. Up to 60 civil\nservants are expected to\nparticipate in the scheme in the\nnext academic year.\nProfessor David Norburn,\nDirector of the Management\nSchool said, \"I am delighted that\nthe Management School has\nbeen selected as one of two\nproviders of this initiative. We\nbelieve that our experience\nworking in partnership with\nindustry, commerce and the\npublic sector qualifies us\nparticularly well for this role.\"\nFELIX Flooded\nWhilst the student newspaper of\nImperial College has been seen\nby some as rather dry this year,\nthis week its offices in Beit Quad\nrang to a patina of dripping leaks. The flood appears to have\nbeen caused by a blocked drain\non the flat roof, which resulted\nin water lapping against the\nceiling windows of the print\nroom. Water also entered the\nDJ's booth in the Ents lounge.\nWith mop in hand one FELIX staff member declared: \"We're\ngoing down!\"\nEg FELIX I0I M1R95 "

    "content": "Feature\nBelieve\nGenuinely curious about\ncondom-clad\nwheelbarrows?\nKaizen attempts to\nmake sense of a Royal\nCollege of Art\nexhibition...\nThe difference between the Royal College of\nArt and the building I had just walked out of\nwas startling. Inside, the exhibition hall is\nlight, spacious and attractive, but a neutral\nbackdrop to any work of art hung there.\nImperial College buildings are in contrast\nfunctional to the point of obsession, with\nelectrical cables and piping flowing along the\nsame conduits as the people.\nThe experience of walking into a gallery\nwas not new to me. This particular exhibition\nwas different, involving many artists who\nwere new to England and, what's more, still\nalive! The curators had titled it ' Make Believe'. This is the opening line from the\ngallery pamphlet:\n'The childhood game of make-believe offers\nthe chance to escape reality and to assume the\ncentral role in a story of our own making.'\nWhile going round the exhibition, I kept thinking why, and for what purpose? As an\nengineer I have always tried to find out how\nthings worked. But in this context asking why\nseemed irrelevant.\nSome of the works were easy to dismiss\nas rubbish. But, when I moved beyond the\nobvious appearance of the image, I found\nthere was more to it. For instance, a new\ngreen wheelbarrow in the centre of the main\ngallery looked as if someone had just\nabandoned it there. It held lots of old\ndiscarded diaries and had a condom wrapped\naround one handle. The guide announced:\n'Wardle invites us to peer into the private\nlife of a stranger from the past, the author of the\n1950s diaries' life being exposed unashamedly.\nThe episode of a condom drying on a wheelbarrow\narm is re-staged here to act as a humorous\nmaterial is ation of an embarrassing moment. But is\nthe author's story an embellishment of the truth or\neven a lie? Or are the diaries themselves fakes?\nThe act of make-believe is in fact the fulcrum of\nthe work and these questions remain unresolved.'\nAs I walked around I realised anyone\ncould derive their own meanings for the\nexhibits. I am used to being able to\nunderstand how things work, but the ideas\nexpressed here eluded me. Maybe it was the\nlanguage used to describe them that was\nunfamiliar to me. These are phrases from the\nguide (pic'n 'mix - you don't have to use them\nall):\n'It takes a sort of dark, morose image, with\na structural symbolism conceptual ising the\nbanality of everyday images'\n'Her gallery installation creates a darkened\nspace in which we assume the intimate role of fly\non the wall'\n'The chairs in the piece actually encourage\nyou to sit down so in effect you become part of the\nwork'\nI can't claim to be able to critically\nevaluate the displays; I can't say it was\ncritically worthy. I went with no particular\nagenda other than genuine curiosity. I was\nable to appreciate it on a certain level - I know what I like - but to talk about anything\nother than its immediate aesthetics, or my\ninitial reaction, would place me completely\nout of my depth. Any analysis I did could\neasily be dispatched.\nOne exhibit was a video by Andrea\nFraser, who took on the role of a curator\nshowing us around the Philadelphia Museum\nof Art, criticising some of the works therein.\nShe considers the use of form and space for\neach object and is very convincing. Only\nwhen she uses the same language for the\nwater fountain, public toilets and windows do\nyou begin to suspect her analysis of the\nexhibits. I got the impression she could\nconvince me a toothbrush was a work of art if\nshe so wished.\nUsing words in this way was foreign to\nme. It wasn't universal at all, completely\nunlike the engineering concepts I was used to.\nAlthough something in the back of my mind\nrejected it, I felt drawn to use the guide's vocabulary as an aid to my understanding.\nBut, if I was to use their emotive words,\nwould I not be confined to criticising the\nwork solely on their terms?\nI0U1 HR95 FELIX M "

And yet\nthat's exactly the description that\nbefits Stourbridge; a Black Country\nindustrial town that spawned a scene of its own. Personally, I never\nhad time for the Stourbridge scene,\nand, like all victims of media-hype,\nthis one was doomed to eventual\nanonymity. The Wonderstuff have\nsplit up and Ned's Atomic Dustbin\nare on the wane, leaving pop will\neat itself valiantly trying to keep\nthe boat afloat.

The\nremixes have been undertaken by\nfellow artists who claim to have\nbeen influenced by PWEI in some\nway over the years. And so we get\nFund-a mental and Die Krupps\nseparately doing the anti-fascist\ntaunt of 'ich bin ein au slander', Jah\nWobble doing 'fam i lush or rib il us', Renegade Soundwave doing\n'underbelly', The Orb doing\n'home', Fluke doing 'r. s.v.p.', and\nso on and so forth. As a concept it\nhas distance, but predictably the\nnew versions stand up small when\ncompared with their original\ncounterparts. Too often the remixes\nmeander into monotonous, quasi-ambient territory, and it's only\noccasionally, such as on the Die\nKrupps interpretation, that the\nkicking drums and shearing guitars\nare brought to the fore to\nmaximum effect (but then what do\nyou expect from a band that can\nrelease tech n if i ed Metallica songs\nand get away with it).\nAt the end of the day, this\nremix album is only for the absolute\ndiehard fans who feel incomplete\nwithout everything put out by their\nfavourite band.

Which is an\nappropriate metaphor to encapsulate both the variety of partners\nhe grapples with and his own\ninstrument of choice, the bass\nguitar. Bass players rarely star but\nthanks to his connections as a member of the now defunct\nseminal band, Minutemen, Watt\ngets to play with plenty of heavyweight rings ter s. However, the fifty\ndifferent bodies he collects tag in\nand out of the ring with a loose\nabandon that can only result in a mixed overall performance.\nThe opening tracks are the\nbest. Watt's gravely lined voice\nstarts proceedings with 'big train'\nand backed up by the Vedder\npowered urging s of 'against the\n70s', these two, at least, seem to\nvalidate the concept. However by\nthe time you hit the barren plains\nof 'rounds' five and onwards, some\nof the obvious improvisation starts\nto get wayward and uncontrolled.\n(With Mascis and Pirner particularly\nindulging themselves in histrionics).\nWhich is the reason that such\nthings as bands exist and bass\nplayers remain bass players.

    "content": "Xtra Curricular Feature\nPost-Graduate students and their problems -Pon_Adlington\nKeys: Unboundedness, Romantic, Pragmatism, Strigmatic\nPressure: Should I cut the red wire or the blue wire?\nBesides the normal life hazards to which all\nstudents are exposed, advanced course and\nresearch students can experience difficulties\nwhich are more or less peculiar to them.\nResearch Students\nWhen I first came to work in the university, I naively assumed that I would not be seeing\nmany PhD students. I was wrong, and I have\ntalked to hundreds of them over the past 20\nyears, and continue to do so. I will simply list\nthe difficulties which arise most frequently in\npractice.\n\u2022 Misunderstandings, and occasionally\novert conflict between research student and\nsupervisor, are a potent source of anxiety and\ndistress. It is the s alien ce of this relationship\nwhich most sharply distinguishes the day-to-day life of the research student from all other\nstudents. Where it works well - and I have no\ndoubt that in the great majority of cases it\ndoes - this relationship can be stimulating\nand immensely productive, but conversely if\nserious tensions arise things can become very\ndifficult.\n\u2022 The essential 'unbounded ness' of research\nin both the ultimate scientific/philosophical\nsense, and the more mundane 'how do I structure my working day' sense seems to me\nto be the other fundamental change which\nthe research student has to accept and cope\nwith. The need for pragmatism in putting a boundary on a research project is sometimes\nin tension with some sort of ideal in a studen-t's mind, and this may throw up serous difficulties at the writing-up stage. The slightly\nperfectionist quality in some students' make-up, which has served them well on taught\ncourses, can actually be something of a burden at research level, where the capacity to\ncompromise is sometimes important.\n\u2022 A capacity for tolerating the mundane is\nnot formally recognised as a required qualification for PhD work, though I believe that it\nis in fact so. Virtually all research students\nhave very good academic records, and moving\non to a PhD programme is the culmination of\nlong-held hopes and ambitions. There is (and\nthere should be) a strongly romantic element\nto it. But the early stages of research can be\nvery unromantic and plodding - chasing up\nequipment and other material resources; literature surveys; the failure of initial ideas for\nresearch topics to crystal lise and it is easy to\nbecome a little bit disillusioned and frustrated and to begin to question whether one has\nmade the right decision.\n\u2022 Students who enjoyed a full social life\nduring their first degrees sometimes experience a powerful sense of physical and social\nisolation when they move into research. This\nvaries according to the relative gregariousness\nof the individual, and also depends strongly\non the ethos of the particular research group\nin which he or she is working.\n\u2022 Uncertainty about 'normal' working\nhours and vagueness about entitlement to\nleave give rise to bad feeling from time to\ntime. Most research students simply fit in to\nan existing pattern, but some students find\nthat the existing pattern tends to eat into\ntime which they had previously seen as their\nown. Partly for this reason, PhD students\nsometimes feel that despite the name they are\nnot really students at all, and for reasons\nwhich from their point of view may or may\nnot be valid, they effectively exclude themselves from participating in student life outside their laboratory or research group.\n\u2022 Research students sometimes feel that\nsupervisors are not always sensitive to the\ntime parameters within which they are operating - parameters usually dictated by rigidly\nrestricted funding. Problems of time and\nmoney are very acute and clearly predictable,\nespecially for some overseas students, some of\nwhom may have used up a third of their\nassured funding following required taught\ncourses, before beginning research at all.\n\u2022 From time to time a student comes to\nrecognise that the decision to do research,\nmade for impeccable motives, was in fact a mistake. This perception may be shared by\nthe supervisor, an agreement having been\nmade that the student should disengage.\nEven though this is accepted as the right\ndecision and in the student's own interests,\nthere is sometimes an irrational but very\npowerful stigmatic sense of failure, which can\ncomplicate other career initiatives.\nThere are a number of things to say\nabout all this. One of them is that most of the\npotential sources of worry I have discussed\nbriefly here have long been recognised. Some\nof them are dealt with very clearly in the col-leg e's booklet 'Research Students and\nSupervisors; their 'Responsibilities and\nDuties'. Research students should have a copy - if not ask for one at the Registry.\nSecond, all research students have chosen to\ndo what they are doing, and what they are\ndoing should on the whole be satisfying and\ncertainly should not be the source of protracted tension and anxiety.\nSeeking help\nThe College Tutors - Dr Gareth Jones in\nPhysics and Dr Margaret Goodgame in\nChemistry - have a college-wide responsibility of the same kind as your supervisor and\nmay be approached directly.\nHowever, there are other people in college on whom you can make demands - and I am one of those. My work is entirely confidential. I can see people quickly - usually on\nthe same day - and I am paid to do nothing\nelse but talk to students. I strongly believe\nthat talking is very important in a crisis. It is\na relief in itself to talk through one's anxieties\n- to share the worry if you like - in a safe\nplace. It is a way of identifying problems\nclearly, and it sometimes throws up new ideas\nfor dealing with difficulties. My office is at IS\nPrinces Gardens, and my telephone number\n(direct dialling) is 071 594 9430.- See last issue\nof FELix/or more details on seeking help.\nMM FELIX iom nR95 "

    "content": "Clued Up\nTHE DOCKER' S FIST I have been most surprised to read\nrecently (Observer 5/3/95) that a term like post-rno dern i smgs, in\nsome circles, being applied to a television program like \"The New\nAdventures of Superman\". Perhaps\nit's just me, but crap journalists are\ndefinitely taking over the world.\nSuperman is a tried and tested\nformula that sells things to\nchildren. If you want to shift a zillion units of kiddie w izz on CBS,\nyou do it during Superman, and\nnot during the fishing show. Any\nallusions to post-modernism\n(whatever that is supposed to be)\ncan only be a motif attached to it at\nrandom by a low flying journalist\ndetermined to sound clever by\nbeing opaque. This is a common\nphenomenon among music\njournalists who constantly assume\nthat things mean something, when\ntheir entire worth is that they mean\nexactly nothing. It is not so much\nthat this is irritating to read, but\nthere i$ a not insignificant\nproportion of society that would\nobey the words of music journalists\nas they would the word of god.\nPeople talk about rock bands like\nElastica as if they had something\nrelevant to say and did so in an\noriginal and erudite manner. The\nsimple truth of this is that they are\na fun sort of pop group that copy\nall their music from old bands like\nthe Stranglers, and take their lyrics\noff the back of cereal packets. The\nmusic press however would have\nyou believe that Elastica were\nformed when Sylvia Plath rose from\nher self-inflicted grave and rang up\nJohnny Marr. This sort of thing is\nwitnessed across the board; but if\nwas post-modernist Superman that\nreally caught my attention.\nIf post modernism means\nwhat I think it does then in my life\nit manifests itself on several levels.\nFirstly and least amusingly in use\nby shite students that like\nThunderbirds (the puppets not the\ndrink - on reflection we are\nactually talking about the same\npeople however you look at it) and\nwalk around with the legend F.A.B. emblazoned across their torso.\nAnother more virulent manifestation of these, circulate in\n'Magic Roundabout' shirts, they\nhave a hidden agenda. They are\nby\nnot only expressing their vastly\nsuperior intellect over the masses\nby their ironic post-modernist\nfashion sense, they are also\nadvertising the fact that they smoke\ndope and say 'man' at the end of\ntheir sentences. Information which\ncan only lead the recipient to\nswoon, with a burning and\nirrepressible lust fired by the\nknowledge that people au fait with\nthe student-drug Zeitgeist are in\nfact deeply cool and not a bunch of\nlimp-dick ed fuck wits( who\ncontinually say 'man' at the end of\ntheir sentences). Slightly more\namusing is the habit of renaming\nthings once named after Nelson\nMandela after television light\nentertainers. Manchester Poly (god\nknows what it's called now... ) has\na Bruce Forsyth Building, and\nsomewhere else has quite recently\nacquired a Desmond Lynam\nlounge.\nAlright, alright, perhaps\nthere is a certain post-modernist\nquality to superman \"Is it a bird ? Is\nit a plane? No, it's a brand-new\ngay icon in blue tights.\". Yes,\npossibly there is a jolt of wit about\nGlyph\nit, but the suggestion of anything\ndry or vaguely derisory about the\nscenarios could only possibly be an\noversight on the part of the extra-zealous script editors, as a result of\ntheir consummate lack of humour. I am yet to be convinced that it is\ndeliberately amusing. Where postmodernism touches me the deepest\nis when I don' t realise that I'm doing it. There has on occasion\nbeen the need for me to describe\nthe appearance of women to other\nblok es. This I am perfectly capable\nof doing, but it still embarrasses me\nto do so; (in case I get it wrong for\na start). I find myself describing her\nas I would a centre forward. \"Well,\nshe's very dominating in the air\nand attacks space in the box very\nwell, but her control often lets her\ndown on the turn and her work\nrate is suspect.\" I think this is fairly\ninnocent and harmless, but I will\nknow that I have created a monster\nif one day I'm trying to buy a car\nand the salesman tells me that \"It\nmay have sag gy tits and a drip py grow ler, but it likes it up the Gary\nand will nine time out of ten make\ncheese sandwiches for the lads.\"\nCrossword by Nyami Nyami\nSolution to last week's Crossword:\nAcross: 7.Mandarin, 8.Orange, 9.Multimedia, 11.Kerb, 12.Blockade,\n14.Tithes, 1 6.Crustacea, 18.Impact, 19.Familiar, 22.Emir, 23.Passageway,\n25.Cliche, 26.Nematode.

    "content": "Standby\nIjQl motormouth with a broken heart\nmrs parker and the vicious\ncircle tells the story of Dorothy\nParker (Jennifer Jason Leigh), one\nof America's most renowned and\nquoted writers, and her circle of\nfriends who lunched every day for\nten years at the Alqonquin Hotel.\nDorothy Parker starts off\nwriting for Vanity Fair but soon her\nabrupt manner and cynical attitude\nlose her the job. Fellow critic Robert\nBenchley (Campbell Scott) decides\nto leave on the principle of this and\ntogether they set up as independent writers. At the same time Mrs\nParker's husband Eddie (Andrew\nMcCarthy) returns home from war\nshell-shocked, addicted to\nmorphine and alcohol. Dorothy\nseeks solace in her friends and the\nnext hour and a half of the film are\nfilled with the endless lunches and\nparties she and her friends hold as\nwell as her love affairs, particularly\nwith Charles McArthur (Matthew\nBroderick). We also see her\nattempted suicide by slitting her\nwrists with all too convincing sound\neffects!\nDorothy's circle of friends\nconsisted of well-known journalists,\ncritics, playwrights, novelists,\nactors. The lunch scenes are always\nvery hectic and it is often quite\nconfusing as to who is doing what,\nwhen and with whom. The shots of\nthe camera panning around the\ntable while everyone is talking only\nadd to the confusion. The film is\nalso inter cut with black and white\nfootage of Dorothy Parker reading\nwhat are supposedly relevant\nquotes from her work. She was said\nto be a great humour is t of her time\nyet these quotes don't seem to\nsubstantiate this. The clipped\nmanner of speaking adopted by\nJennifer Jason Leigh is often hard\nto understand too which leaves the\nviewer wondering how a young\nwoman in her thirties can end up\nsounding like a woman in her\nnineties. But the main problem with\nthe film is that it is based on a group of people who probably noone is old enough to remember or\nanyone outside of America is likely\nto know. When added to the fact\nMrs Parker seems to have led a rather unremarkable life, this\nmakes for a sleep-inducing film.\n^ sweaty\nhall of fame at RAW last Saturday\nwas one of the biggest fashion\nstatements i 've seen for a long time\n- this is obviously where the notion\nof dressing up for the weekend\noriginated. One of the larger\nvenues around, Hall of Fame is\nwhere 'the crowd' go out to play -and the music is correspondingly\ngood. The 'boys from the old\nschool' were out in force, mixing\nhappily with the infants (like myself)\nand a memorable New Yorker\noffering champagne parties for\nfour! The music that greets you is\npurely funky, dropped by Dezzie D, Sinbad and Nick Shipton in the\nsugar room - small, sweaty and\nheaving, with a well deserved\nreputation for excellence. Brian\nNorman, Thad and Colin Reid\nmount the stage in the huge main\nroom where the policy is mostly\nswing, bar the occasional foray into\ndeep funk or even house. One of\nthe joys of this place is that the DJs\nplay whatever takes their fancy,\nand it's quality all the way. The\natmosphere is pumping, the vibe is\npure party and the chill out space is\nminimal - as long as there's music\nthis crowd will be dancing. Too\nmany Saturdays away from RAW in\nthe future and i 'll consider my\nweekends wasted.\nA brief exception will be made\nfor no rooms for squares tomorrow, where Gilles Peterson\nand Joe Davis hold sway for a night\nof old and new school jazzy\nflavours and a smattering of\nBrazilian beats. Among the chosen\nfew recommended in iD magazine, it includes film shows\ndisclosure has been promoted\nas a film about sexual harassment\nwith the twist that the man is the\nsubject of the harassment from a woman. However the sexual\nharassment is only part of the plot,\nand the main theme is really about\ncorporate politics, though the\nsexual harassment stands out the\nmost in the film, as it is used by one\ncharacter to control another person\nin order to profit from it.\nTom Sanders (Michael\nDoug/as) has pinned his hopes on a high presidential promotion in the\nfirm Digicom. The situation turns\nagainst Sanders and he is passed\nover for Meredith Johnson (Demi\nMoore), with whom he happened to\nhave an affair years before.\nSanders then finds himself the\ntarget of Johnson's seduction.\nWhen he rejects her advances she\naccuses him of sexual harassment.\nThe film produces a tense\nsituation: you see Sanders' career\nbeing sabotaged and his family life\nfalling apart. As he attempts to find\nanswers to his crumbling career\nyou see a complex game being\nplayed out. Then when Sanders\nstarts receiving email from an\nanonymous friend the question\nbecomes: who is actually\ncontrolling Tom and who will gain\nmost from the outcome?\nMichael Douglas is finally\nshowing his age and it's perhaps\nsurprising that the role didn't go to\na younger actor. Still Demi Moore's character is aggressively ambitious and manages to play the\ncorporate game better than the\nmen. The use of high tech virtual\nreality and an electronics company\nas backdrop merely gives the film a nineties setting; the computer\neffects were stunning, if a little out\nof place in a corporate thriller.\nThe plot is not complex as\nmany thrillers but the varied\nsubplots will appeal to many\npeople. The interesting twists\nduring the film and the resulting\nsuspense makes Disclosure\nenjoyable to watch. 0\nplus a chill-out with pool and table\nsoccer (now that should please a certain small sub-set of JCR\nregulars).

    "content": "Incoming\nMarcus Alexander's secret identity revealed... OSC Committee\nmembers slam Chairman... IslamSoc praised & ULU complaint...\nEdited this week by Mark Baker\nPrater Fiam\nBashing\nDear Owain,\nFirstly, let me congratulate on\nthe quality of Felix so far this year,\nwhich far and away exceeds last\nyear's output. As you may recall, I was not the greatest fan of your\nesteemed predecessor, who was to\njournalism what Pol Pot was to the\nCambodian Tourist office, as vital\nto the running of Felix as David\nMellor is to the Elite Model Agency.\nThe newspaper has ceased to be a wish y was hy magazine, containing\nmasses more material than was\nthe case last year. Above all, that\nbloody awful cop-out of a cover\nhas been replaced by news that's actually worth reading.\nHowever, even the most rosy\ngarden contains the odd weed,\nand despite the liberal doses of\nParaquat that you have applied,\none literary thistle has taken root.\nI mean, of course, Frater Fiam.\nFrom his earliest writings (Felix,\n1006), in which he must have\nscared the living daylights of the\npoor fresher s already a bit dubious\nabout choosing to spend three of\ntheir formative years at Imperial, I had my doubts about the state of\n'your Frater', but decided it was a phase he was going through, and\nthought no more of it. Issue 1009\nwas a definite cry for help, so\nmuch so that I did not expect to\nhear from said columnist again.\nMais non, for in Issue 1018, we\nbegin to see the shift of this\ntroubled soul from the disturbed to\nthe impenetrable. Our Frater\nrapidly learned the art of penning\n400 words of purple prose which\nsaid absolutely nothing. I think we\nare looking at a man who could\nteach Tony Blair's speech writer a thing or two. To be fair, he\nadmitted as much in Issue 1015,\nadmitting \"the realisation hits me\nthat many will say 'What a load of\nbullshit'\". To describe his columns\nas a \"puzzle\" is a bit of an\nunderstatement. A few weeks ago,\nI nearly sent a birthday card c/o Felix to our Frater, since, as no\nstudent could afford such a huge\nthesaurus as he was now using,\nthis was the only explanation.\nThese bizarre, meaningless\narticles continued on and off with\ntalk even of \"Confused Ramblings\non Senseless Topics\" (Felix 1019).\nIn this complete and utter waste of\ninnocent trees, even the writer\nhimself questions whether \"your\nGood Frater has slipped beyond\nthe bounds of comprehensibility\".\nMaybe this blok e is Tony Blair's speech writer? However, all of this\nis of nothing compared to the\ncomplete and utter drivel that\ngraced the pages of the latest\nissue. If I have a cold, I do not feel\nit necessary to share the\nexperience with the rest of\nImperial. On the contrary, such\nmatters are best kept quiet. To\ntalk of the common cold as some\nkind of pleasure-inducing drug on\na par with more exotic \"chemical\npleasures\" is total rubbish. Friends\nof friends assure me this is not the\ncase, and suggest that our Frater\nhas been looking in the wrong\nplaces. Either that, or he has been\nso successful in his pursuit of\nrecreational pharmaceuticals that\nhe's taken a long stroll out of\nRealityville never to return. Were it\nthe case, then life as a drug dealer\nwould be as lucrative as that of the\nAmbre Solaire sales rep working in\nthe Cleethorpes area.\nThe previous week, Our Frater\nwas missing, and I nearly wrote in\nimploring all of Imperial to reward\nyou handsomely for a such a public-spirited gesture. In the\nsame issue, there was a truly\nbizarre article on the very mad\nYves Klein, whose only redeeming\nfeature seems to be a more than\npassing resemblance to Dreyfuss in\nthe Pink Panther films. The\nweirdness of the artist was more\nthan matched by the weirdness of\nthe article, by Marcus Alexander.\nAs a youthful, energetic first year,\nmy ultimate aim at Imperial was\nnot to achieve a First, but to solve\nthe two ultimate questions that this\nestablishment throws up - firstly,\nhow have Imperial College\nCatering got away with it for so\nlong, and secondly to be able to\nsay 'Yes, I do know what the hell\nMarcus Alexander is talking about.'\nSadly both were beyond the wit of\na humble student such as I.( Or so\nI thought, until Marcus' excellent\nand comprehensible 'Cat & Mouse'\nthis week. Bastard!). I then found\nout that Frater Fiam is Marcus\nAlexander. Everything makes\nsense!\nMarcus is clearly a very good\nwriter, as this week showed, but\nallowing such self-indulgent,\nmeaningless rubbish that is no\nmore than a subtle advert for\nRoget's Mega Thesaurus to clog up\nthe pages of Felix is too much.\nThe Docker's Fist has already\nbitten the dust - although it was\nthe better of the two - and our\ndear Frater should follow.\nSimon Baker\nChem li\n/ agree that Marcus is an enigma,\nbut I think a very worthwhile one. I find that it cheers me up\nenormously to find someone more\nmentally disturbed than myself. As\nfor the possibility of him being Tony\nBlair's speech writer... well, I always\nwondered where all the money\ncame from. Oh, good surname by\nthe way 8-).\nNight of the\nlong knives?\nDear Felix,\nWe are referring to last week's news story: 'Japanese boycott\nInternational Night' You quoted\nMr. A. Mershin, OSC chairman,\nsaying: 'Nobody else has had any\nproblems, nobody else has\ncomplained, everybody else is\nhappy'. May we point out that this\nis not true.\nWhereas there have been no\nwritten complaints, representatives\nfrom overseas societies have\ncomplained orally on more than\none occasion about Mr. Mershin's notoriously disorganised way of\nhandling affairs and his lack of\ncommunication. Meetings\nthroughout the year were mostly at\nvery short notice, with the venue\noften changing at last minute. This\nd is organisation became even more\nobvious during the last week of\npreparation for the International\nNight. If it hadn't been for a number of other people, the event\nwould never have happened.\nWe would therefore like to use\nthis space to thank the following\npeople in the name of the OSC\nexec: The Union, the Stewards\nand the Sabbaticals, Security,\nStoic, all the volunteer helpers, the\nchairpersons of the participating\nsocieties, the caterers for the food\nfair, the bands, the DJ, the\nperformers on the cultural show,\nthe com peres, the societies' stage\nmanagers, the backstage crew,\nand last but definitely not least\nDramSoc.\nAll of you did a great job and it\nwas a pleasure to work with you.\nFor OSC exec\nOSC External Affairs Officer :\nJohn Sinner\nOSC Vice Chairman : Rahul Dua\nOSC Events Officer : Ducan M. Samarasingle\nIt's sad to hear that you obviously\nhave no love for you Chairmanhave you raised the matter with him\npersonally? Or do you prefer\ncowardly insults in Felix?\nCommunication can be a wonderful\nthing if you try!\nTa IslamSoc,\ntalk to me\nULTJ\nDear Felix,\nI am writing this letter for two\nreasons: Firstly, to give my sincere\nthanks to all at IC IslamSoc, for the\nkind gift that they gave me.\nDuring SCC week, I asked\nsomeone at their stall where I would be able to get a copy of the\nKoran in English with explanation.\nThey said they would get back to\nme with the information. Two\nweeks later, I found a copy in my\nunion pigeonhole which they had\ngiven me as a gift.\nI would like to thank all of the\nIslamSoc committee very much\nindeed for this kind gesture.\nOn another issue, the ULU\nelections. I nominated Damian for\na GUC position, only because I met him in the street and he asked\nme to sign his ballot sheet. He had\nto explain to me what the position\nwas as I had no idea.\nPerhaps ULU should make\nmore of an effort to inform each\nindividual college of ULU activities,\nissues, policy and services offered\nand also positions or offices\nneeded through each college's services. Although we are a \"Central London\" University of\nLondon College, it feels very\nisolated from the main body of\nULU and perhaps if more members\nof ICY were aware of what was\ngoing on, maybe through Felix,\nUnion notices, STOIC or any other\nsource, more ICU members would\nplay a role. We all have something\nto gain from and contribute to ULU\nand should not be left out of the\nopportunities open to us.\nSarah Waiman\nChem Eng 2\nHear, hear.' Although I am but a lowly first year, I have attended just\none ULU event. It does seem a bit\nof a shame that we currently stand\na better chance of finding out what\nis going on at ULU by reading Time\nOut rather than FELIX.

    "content": "Feature\nTony Grew gazes into his crystal ball\nThe Oscars stand out above all the\nother awards ceremonies as the\none everybody pays attention to.\nYou can have your Tony's, your\nBafta's, your Emmy's, your Brits,\neven your Ivor Novello's but the\nlittle blok e standing on top of a roll\nof film with nothing on is still the\none everyone wants. With the\nceremony less than three weeks\naway we here at FELIX have\ndecided to provide you with a short\nguide to this year's nominations,\nall the better to talk know led g ably in the Union bar with.\nAs you probably know, the\nprocess by which a movie\npersonage comes to receive an\nOscar has as much to do with\nHollywood politics as it has with\ndoing good work. This year is no\nexception, and that is why I am\ngoing to try very hard not to go on\nabout who I think should win and\ninstead stick with who will win! For\nexample, Woody Allen has been\nnominated for Best Director for\nBullets Over Broadway, but with\nthe year he has had I don't think\nhe will be honoured. Even without\nthe sexual abuse allegations he is\nnot a real contender because of\nhis distaste for Hollywood and his\nrefusal to attend in the past.\nOne also has to remember\nthat the Academy (Of Motion\nPicture Arts and Sciences), who\ngive the Oscars is one of the most\nexclusive clubs in the world. As a result most of its membership is\nover 45 and very rich. They are the\nHollywood elite and do not reflect\nthe tastes of anyone except\nthemselves. This is why winning an\nOscar is so good for your career; it\nshows you have been noticed. At\ntimes the Academy have been\nattacked for being too con-serva ti ve, but their choices have\ncaused upset in the past, such as\nthe astounding award of the top\nfive Oscars (Best Actor, Actress,\nDirector, Film and Screenplay) to\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\nbeing at that time only the second\nmovie ever to do so. There has\nbeen rumours that Forrest Gump,\nalready the biggest movie of the\nyear in the US, would repeat this\nsweep, having been nominated for\n13 Oscars, one more than\nSchindler's List last year and only\none away from the record 14\nwhich All About Eve set in the\nFifties. But Gump fever was six\nmonths ago, and although the\nmovie is still seen as a contender,\nthe intervening time and the\nappearance of worthy challengers\nsuch as Pulp Fiction and Quiz\nShow means it probably won't do\nas well as had been predicted\ninitially. 1995 is one of the most\ndifficult years to call in recent\nmemory for this reason, but we\nhave persevered and here are our\npredictions:\nBest Picture It looks like this\none will still go to Forrest Gump,\nsimply because of the sheer\namount of money it has taken and\nthe fact that Pulp Fiction is seen as\na little too violent to get any major\nawards.\nACC DISCOUNT DAY SUNDAY\nMARCH 12TH SAVE AN\nEXTRA\n10% ON\nALL\nCALLS\nALL DA YA ACC Long Distance UK Ltd.

If\nyou've seen our posters then you'll know that\na casino, disco, and eating competitions will\nbe among the attractions. You can even get a discount on the entry price if you wear your\nRed Nose. So come along and join in the fun,\nas it's all in aid of a very good cause.\nTomorrow is the first of our collections\nfor the Inter-railing prize. We have permits to\ncollect in the streets of Wimbledon, Putney\nand Wandsworth among other places, for the\nRoyal Hospital and Home based in Putney.\nDon't miss out on your chance to win the\nholiday of a lifetime. We are also collecting\nfor this charity on 17th March , in the City.\nThis will be a great chance to raise loads of\ncash as you can get money from all the rich\nbusiness people in the pubs!\nIf you would rather collect at a concert\nthen we have permits to collect at the Prince\n(or should that be \"the artist formerly known\nas Prince\"!) concert on the Wednesday 22nd March at Wembley.\nFinally, as promised, here is a short\nreview of that magnificent event that was the\nRag Tour. So much happened that I can't possibly tell all here but if anyone would like\nto know the full gory details then the log\nbooks are in the RCS office. The tour eventually got underway with the first minibus leaving at 12.15 on that fateful Friday after several group photos and a rendition of the\n\"Kangela\".\nFirst stop was in Leicester where half the\nminibus passengers stormed the campus\nwhile the other half trundled off to\nLoughborough. We then all descended on a Nottingham pub as Rag Mag selling is very\nthirsty work! Once our temporarily disappearing Rag Chair had been found we all proceeded to Leeds where we met up with the\nsecond minibus and Paul Thomas, our ex-RCS president, whose house we stayed at.\nThose people who didn't want to squash into\nthe living room decided to sleep in the\nminibus - a very good idea in February!\nThe next morning was mostly spent trying to find a greasy spoon cafe. Those in York\nsucceeded, but we who went to Sheffield\nended up eating fish & chips for breakfast.\nAfter sufficiently terror ising the local students and selling them our Mags we all met\nup in Bradford where they were having a beer\nfestival - oh dear, what a shame! After a hard\nday's work(?) and several pints we all piled\ninto a great curry house along with Paul\nThomas who later left and didn't return. We\nstill don't know whether he ever made it\nhome!\nMost unfortunately it was Matt Szyndel's21st birthday that evening so we tried being\nreally nice to him but he insisted on being\nhandcuffed and having his legs shaved; hence\nhis new nickname \"smoothie legs\". One other\nmember of the trip also managed to lose half\nhis moustache - very clumsy! Many thanks\ngo to Chris Bragg's mum for putting up with\n20 rowdy students that night and even providing us with food. We also made our mark\nin the local pub where we sang and played\ndrinking games.\nSunday involved a trip to another greasy\nspoon, followed by tours of the halls in Manchester and Liverpool. We had a final\nphoto session outside Liverpool before the\ntwo minibuses went their separate ways. The\nfirst one returned to London and whilst\ndoing so the occupants of the minibus managed to compose many new songs! They also\nmade friends(?) with a bus load of bell-ringers from the Royal College of Music. The\nsecond minibus went to Keele and\nBirmingham among other places on their way\nback on the Monday. Altogether the tour was\nvery worthwhile as everyone enjoyed themselves and raised a total of over \u00a3740 for the\nRag nominated charities.\n3(BW 80(3\nFestival of Purim\nKeys: Haman, Esther, Hillel\nComing up next week, on Thursday 16th March, is the festival of Purim. This festival\ncommemorates the rescue of the people from\nthe hands of Haman by Queen Esther and\nMordechai, when the people were living in Persia.\nThis is one of the most joyous festivals of\nthe year, because total destruction was avoid-ed. On it, the book of Esther is read twice,\nonce at night and once in the morning,\nmoney is given to the poor, gifts of food are\ngiven to friends and a large feast is had in the\nevening. The tradition is to get dressed up,\nwear masks and get very drunk, so much so\nthat you cannot tell the difference between\nyour friends and your enemies. This is\nbecause the positions were switched in the\nstory, and the role of God was hidden\nthroughout.\nIn honour of this festival, there is a Purim Party in Hillel House, Euston on\nWednesday 15th March. There will be service\nbeforehand, which commences at 8pm. For\nthose dressed regularly the price is \u00a32, but for\nthose in fancy dress the price is just \u00a31! So\ncome along dressed up, where there will be\nalcohol, food and dancing aplenty.\nThat Friday, to mark the end of the\n\"Fifty Days for Fifty Years\" project, there is\nan evening meal in Hillel House, with a talk\nby Ben Helfgot, an Auschwitz survivor. The\nprice is just \u00a33.50 so please call the London\nRegion UJS office on 0171-388-4919 to book\nyour place. If you wish to stay over there are\nfacilities available.\nBefore all of these events, Hilary Curtis,\nwho works for the British Medical Council, is\ncoming to talk on the subject of Aids and\nHIV in the community. This will be on\nMonday March13 th at 12.30 pm in the\nManagement School, 53 Princes Gate.

Insert Matt Crompton - just\nStaff Asked to Waive Rights\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAM Contract Research Staff (CRS)\nare up in arms against changes\nthat college has made to their\nterms and conditions. The staff,\nwho are employed on short terms\nof about two years, are angry with\nthe new contracts which contain\nclauses that waive their right to\nprotection against unfair\ndismissal and statutory\nminimum redundancy payments.\nDr Julian Borri ll, who is the\nAssociation of University\nTeachers ( AUT) contract\nresearch staff representative at\nImperial, said: \"there is no\njustification for this.\" However,\nthose CRS who have been in\nemployed by college for more\nthan seven years are set to\nbenefit. They will be entitled to\ncollege redundancy pay worth\ntwo and half times the statutory\nminimum.\nThe changes have been\nintroduced to bring Imperial into\nline with St Mary's, who have\nhad this type of contract for a long time. Some research grant\nholders claim that as the\nredundancy pay comes from\ndepartmental budgets and not\nthe college, departments could go\nbankrupt with burgeoning\npayments. With even the\nDepartment for Education itself\nagainst such waivers, recognising\nthat it does not reward staff, the\nchanges are being fiercely contested by the AUT at Imperial. In\na meeting on Monday they\ndevised a draft four point plan for\ncontract staff that they would like\nto see college accept. This list\nincludes: that no-one should\nhave to sign any kind of waiver;\nthat no improvement in conditions of service in one\ngroup of workers should reduce\nthat of others; that redundancy\npay be the responsibility of\ncollege and not that of individual\ndepartments (as was done\nrecently with maternity pay); and\nthat Contract Research staff\nshould enjoy the same\nredundancy pay as other staff.\n\"It has made a lot of people\nangry,\" said Julian Borrill. But\nRob Let ham, IC's Senior\nPersonnel Manager, said that the\nAUT had been \"fully consulted\nin the proper manner\" and that\nhe thought that the union\nexecutive \"were out of touch with\ntheir members.\"\nIt has been suggested by\nsome within college that the\nunfair dismissal waiver could be\nused as a way of removing staff\n(continues on page three)\nQ news one&two&three \u2022 editorial&credits three \u2022 incoming five \u2022 s files seven \u2022 clued up\nnine \u2022 feature: fables for our time? ten \u2022 feature: make believe, the rca, art and ic eleven\n\u2022 feature: before their time - the oscars twelve \u2022 cartoon: radio for the deaf thirteen \u2022\nxtra curricular: including the final dose of Don Adlington fourteen&fifteen&sixteen \u2022 standby\neighteen&nineteen&twenty \u2022 twelve day guide twenty two& twenty three \u2022 sport: go4 it! twenty four H "

    "content": "<2M> This Year's Success Story\nKeys: France, Hamble, Yuppies\nThis year has been an incredible success for\nthe Imperial College Yacht Club. We have\nseen a two-fold increase in its student membership since the previous academic year and\nhave become one of the largest clubs in the\nACC. The main reason for this sudden expansion is the funding provided by the\nHarlington Trust, which has enabled the\nClub to cut the cost of sailing weekends from\nover \u00a340 to just \u00a325 and go sailing much more\noften. This means that the Club has achieved\none of its most important goals, that of introducing the sport of sailing to the largest possible number of students at the lowest prices\npossible (i.e. very low, to fit with student\nbudgets!).\nSince the beginning of last term the Club\nhas organised 14 sailing weekends, with more\nto come. No less than 100 students have gone\nsailing with it, more than half being total\nnewcomers to the sport of sailing. The low\ncost of weekends is not the only reason for\ntheir success; they are also a good opportunity to get away from the oppressive grey ness of\nLondon life and the pressures of the College\nschedule. To enjoy a sport that is as ecologically friendly as it is exciting, the students\nwho have tried it just keep coming back for\nmore. Our booking system crashed miserably\ndue to the demand at the end of last term!\nThe Club's programme to produce experienced skippers also received a boost this\nyear with the successful completion of the\nYachtmaster shore based course and VHF license course by more than 20 members. A long passage to Weymouth was also carried\nout for the purpose of Yachtmaster training\nMM FELIX I0M95\nand a gruelling but incredibly popular passage to France by three boats is being\nplanned for next term.\nCompetition-wise, we have also seen a greater involvement in high profile regattas\nwith the Club now having a well-established\nteam which raced in the Hamble winter series\nlast term. The results of the nine-week long\nchampionship were not astounding, as there\nwas a very high percentage of professional\ncompetitors participating in the series. The\nracing abilities of our crews were proven\nwhen both the Club's teams charged right\ninto the finals of the Sunsail winter series in\nDecember. Unhindered by gale force winds\nand countless equipment failures we obtained\nfifth place out of the twenty boats that had\nreached the final. This term the team is training hard for the forthcoming Student\nNationals at the end of March where we have\na strong chance of tarnishing Portsmouth\nUniversity's year long winning record.\nThe Yacht Club is presently chartering\nboats, but it was recently decided at the AGM to launch another proposal for the acquisition\nof a boat by the College. Last year a similar\nproposal was met un favourably by the\nSherfield yuppies partly because of the kind\nof boat requested and partly because of the\nlow membership attained by the Club since\nits birth in the late eighties. This year the\nYacht Club Management Committee will be\nsubmitting a revised proposal and, combined\nwith the rising popularity of the Club\nthroughout College, we have a higher chance\nof success. The acquisition of a boat, which is\nan inevitable consequence of the continuing\nexpansion of the Club, will make it possible\nfor our members to appreciate the fuller\naspect of sailing's 'way of thinking'. That is\nthe hard work, organisation, responsibility,\nteamwork and a good dose of fresh air that\ncomes with the owning and maintenance of a boat.\n[DcyaGflcjjQQ\nDramSoc and OpSoc Present\nKeys: Volpone, Festival, Grease\nSpring has sprung (not), the grass is wet and\nDramSoc and OpSoc bring you the second\nImperial College Drama Festival. For your\ndelight this year we bring you something old\n(Volpone), something new (Liam's Shady\nDealer), something borrowed (Sketches) and a revue (Another Hundred People).\nVolpone\nVolpone is the fox. Popular mythology paints\na picture of a cunning, predatory beast and\nBen Jonson human is es this imagery to create\na consummate con artist. In Elizabethan\ntimes Venice was considered the wealthiest\nand most corrupt European city; this is the\nstage onto which Volpone is thrust. Around\nthis cental charmer, Jonson weaves a tale of\ngreed and inhumanity, a brilliant, hilarious\nsatirical comedy. An overpowering lust for\nwealth drives the central characters to fight\nover a supposedly dying man. Only Volpone\nand his assistant Mosca know that Volpone is\ntricking these greedy vultures out of their\nremaining riches. Their unflagging invention\nkeeps them on top, but will they be able to\nstay there?\nJonson was a comic master and his brand\nof humour is closer to Blackadder than Much\nAdo About Nothing. Dramsoc's production\nprovides a chance to see the best work of this\ngreat playwright and, more importantly, to\nhave a good time.\nVolpone is showing at 7.30pm in the\nUnion Concert Hall on the 14, 15, 17 and\n18th of March. Prices are \u00a33.50 (full) and\n\u00a32.50 (cone).\nLiam's Shady Dealer\nWhen you meet someone in a park and the\noffer you, how shall we put it, certain substances to, provide relief from your troubles.\nDo you accept? Liam did. And what happens\nwhen you do? Do you forget your troubles?\nLiam didn't. How does your life continue?\nBetter or worse? Liam can't tell. Do you have\nany choices left? Liam doesn't know.\nLiam's Shady Dealer is presented along\nwith a little light relief. Sketches is exactly\nthat. A set of manic comedy scenes linked\ntogether with little snippets of improvisation.\nOne critic described it as laughter on the edge\nof disaster so come along and see what you\nthink.\nLiam's Shady Dealer is showing on 16\nMarch at 8.00pm and on 18 March at 3.00pm. Another hundred People\nFresh from the success of Cabaret OpSoc\nbring you Another Hundred People. This delightful revue brings together songs from\nthe musical Grease and Five Guys Named Moe\nto create an all singing all dancing extra va ganza.\n\n"

    "content": "Standby\nmolded with confusion\nmud\nIt's hard to know what to say about\nMaria Irene Fornes' play mud. You\ncould view it as autobiographical I suppose. Fornes, like her character\nMae, has experienced illiteracy and\npoverty. But it doesn't follow to\nthen go on and say that as\nhappened in real life, the play\nconcerns the power imparted to\nMae by her education. Indeed\nwhat's most striking is how non\nmetaphorical the play actually is. Its\nevents just happen, without there\nbeing any underlying reasons for\nthem. Which is, in this case, a general criticism of the play. Things\nhappen - so what - things happen\nin everyone's life. The point of a play, especially one that rubs itself\nin the dirt of realism, is to place\nsuch events within some sort of\nunified scheme, not just leave the\naudience confused.\nThe plot, as it stands,\nnominally concerns the fragmentation of the relationship between\nMae and Lloyd that occurs with the\nentry of Henry. The men start poles\napart; Lloyd is young, ill,\ndesperately poor and uneducated\nwhilst Henry is pretentious,\nrelatively rich and middle aged. As\nMae passes her attention towards\nthe latter, Lloyd is compared,\nclumsily perhaps, to the hermit crab\nwhich has lost its shell. Yet as the\nplay draws to a conclusion Lloyd\ngrows stronger, whilst Henry ends\nup a wasted cripple. Mae fli(r) ts\ninbetween the two, all the while\nbecoming dominant. But for all the\nparallels available Fornes doesn't appear to be making a statement\nabout education, feminism, sexual\nempowerment or religion.\nNone of this would matter\nhowever, if the play was gripping in\nand of itself. And whilst it\napproaches it in places, noticeably\nin the physical it y of the opening\nscene and wide eyed naivety of\nMae, these remain piecemeal in\nsum. Just as Mae, Lloyd and Henry\nend the play in extreme states of\ndespair and paradise, so the\naudience are left in an\nuncomfortable limbo, half way\nbetween their destination and the\nplace they started at.\nDid you know that Paul Merlon\nwas a guest on Desert Island Discs\ntwo years ago? To me, this is like\nwriting your autobiography at the\nage of 25, but perhaps it's just a signal that the powers-that-were\nthought they'd better get in quick\nbefore he fell from grace. To judge\nby this production of Arthur Smith's live bed show at the Garrick\nTheatre, in which he stars\nalongside his wife Caroline\nQuentin, the downward curve has\nyet to start.\nLive Bed Show is a play which\nhappens mostly in bed, and we\nwere encouraged to remember this\nthrough the purchase of some\npyjamas in the foyer. The set\nconsisted of two single beds which\nslid together to form a double bed,\nwhich strokes of genius allowed the\nfull gamut of possibilities: scenes in\nhis bedroom, her bedroom and the\nbed section of a department store.\nThe bed-happenings included\ndreams, fantasies and, I think, a real story about things like\n\u2022 ES fli decisions and commitment. More\nimportantly, there were laughs -but not too many. From Arthur\nSmith and two comedians, you\nmight have expected more rolling\nin the aisles, but there wasn't really\nthe space, and there weren't really\nthe jokes.\nUp on the third tier of the tall,\nthin Garrick Theatre, I felt a little as\nthough I was peering down from\nthe top of a sort of inverted Tower\nof Pisa, and it didn't really sink in\nthat I was watching Paul Merton\n'off the telly' until about half way\nthrough. Sadly, though, it wasn't really Paul Merton off the telly. His\ntrue talent is in making people\ngiggle helplessly at silliness, and\nLive Bed Show was a play with a message, not a punchline. 0\n0 rotation\nblistering barnacles' as my\ngood friend captain haddock is\n;\nVi \u2022 \u2022 : .\n.\u2022!>l..:i:: \u2022 : r:ai ess.. tron s global under gr our? international times\nWell it could be a tune for a tv\nadvert I 'pose - timex or swatch\nperhaps.

In the poll for DP(F&S) this overcame the majority that\nAnnie Matthewman achieved\non the South Kensington campus. It was also the first\nyear that an official has stayed\nwith the St Mary's ballot box at\nall times, so the medic's union\nwas not able to bring the box\naround lecture theatres as was\nusual previously.\nAt South Kensington voting proceeded with some\nhitches, with a number of the\nswipe card machines not\nworking. FELIX understands\nthat not all the machines\nfunctioned properly during the\nCity & Guilds elections the\nprevious week, but the\nproblems went un reported. As\nthese problems may have\ncontributed to the decline in turnout this year, Union officials are considering a return to voting solely by\nUnion Card.\n(StaffAsked to Waive Rights continues\nwho are involved in activities\nsuch as trade union representation.

The kids.\nOver the previous few weeks\na coordinator from the Pimlico\nscheme here in college had seen\nme at least three times to try to\narrange some spectacular event\nfor a group of school kids on a Wednesday afternoon.

But rather than\nawait the command to fire they\ntook pot shots at will. \"Where's the newspaper then?\", \"Are you\ngoing to write about Arsenal?\",\n\"Are you Maxwell?\", \"Boring!\".\nAhem. At this point I panicked. A couple of years ago I wanted to be a school teacher.\nNow I wanted to be bunking off\nagain. I panicked and took them\nto see the printing presses,\nknowing that machines quiet en little kids. (Top tip - steamrollers\nare brilliant at this). It worked,\nbut it also quickly quiet e ned Mr Printer. Fearing I'd have a new\nBrady on my hands and little kids\nentrails splattered all over the\nnext issue I quickly herded them\nall out again.\nAcutely aware that they'd still not been told of how a newspaper works, I directed them\nto Andrew Smith, news hound. He's best placed to teach them the\nways of the media, the ins and\nouts of journalism, I reasoned.\nI'm best suited for cowering at the\nback. \"Do you make things up?\"\nthey asked. All sweetness, he\nresponded: \" Well I try not to\nusually,\" displaying admirably\nthe integrity of FELIX staff.\nLying about lying!\nThe scariest moment though\nwas when I took eight of them\ninto the camera-room to enlarge a picture from J17. \"Now, if I put\nMatt under here...\" I said, moving\nthe picture into place. \"Whose\nMatt? That's Ant!\" they chimed.\nAnd \"Well, they all change so\nfast,\" had said my mother.\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nAssistant Printer Jeremy Thomson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Helen Randall\nEditorial Team\nArt & Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nClubs, Societies & Union Piers Daniell\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nFeatures Kate Cox\nLayout and Design Mark Baker\nMusic Vik Bansal\nNews The News Teom\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nPuzzles Tim St Clair\nS Flles The News Team\nEight Day Guide Jeremy Thomson\nSport Juliette Decock and Mark Baker\nStandby Jon Jordan\nTheatre Joseph Barr\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week\nJon Jordan, Paul Dias,\nMark Baker, Rachel Walters\nTyping Steven Se\nHelpfulness Mandy Hurford\nFELIX MB\n\n"

The four year course involves study both in Imperial's Physics\ndepartment and at the Royal College of Music (RCM).\nThe launch of the new course met with much applause: \"I think it has\nopened one of the gateways between the institutions\", said David Burgess, a physics professor who helped set up Imperial's side of the deal, when interviewed\nin the 1994 Alumni Newsletter. \"For students whose interests span both the arts\nand sciences, it's an opportunity to extend their work in both these areas\", commented\ncurrent RCM director Janet Ritterman in a FELIX interview.\nBut a connection between IC and the RCM is not without precedent. A link was forged\nnearly 40 years ago by the director of the Royal College of Music, .er Sir George Dyson, a man\nwhose published work included a__ military textbook: Grenade Warfare as ,\nwell as more pastoral, musical, works\nsuch as Sweet Thames Run Softly.\nThe link runs on through his\nfamily: .es'Sir George's son, *Freeman\nDyson, is an eminent physicist who\nonce gave the annual Schroedinger\nlecture at IC.

At the age of 17\nhe won a scholarship to the RCM to study organ\nand composition, after which he travelled\naround Europe for four years.\nWorld War One saw him as a brigade\ngrenadier officer, during which time he wrote\nGrenade Warfare. The Dictionary of National\nBiography for 1961 noted glowingly: \"His\nextraordinary versatility was manifest\".\nZI ZZZ Z In 1937 he became director of\n^ ^ ^ ^ the RCM. Cutting his salary in half and\nturning a classroom into a bedroom,\n1 \u2022 j^ Dyson kept the college open during\nWorld War Two, saying that \"the arts\nshould be honoured in the dark days\".\n^Freeman Dyson wrote in his\nautobiography Disturbing the Universe\nthat this was \"his father's finest hour\".\n: ' K'y:0 \u2022 ing, the RCM and Imperial\nA month after jgf Dyson received\nhis knighthood in January 1941, the\nRCM building was hit by a fire bomb,\nand a group of Imperial students\nhelped put out the blaze.\nAfter the war, an embryo\nstudents' union formed. The RCM's Centenary Record notes that with\n.ef Dyson' s blessing, \"various musical\nand social activities\" were set up\nbetween the RCM and Imperial. In\n1949, .ef Dyson composed music for\npart of Wordsworth's \"The Excursion\"\nas part of Imperial's Commemoration\nDay celebration. A Phoenix correspondent wrote that \"The colour and\npageantry of the Celebration is a welcome innovation in the life of the\nCollege\".\nIn 1950, .ef Dyson was made an\n! honorary Fellow of Imperial College of\nScience, and he retired from the RCM\nin 1952.\nDp-* ids im M'fi ff,f| p:/:,,.;^f re^^ j>. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 ., :5):if i1 i.:t ITS li\ni,.:...I,!. loir.|1,' \u2022 1 >r>)'V' cl ill w' jj fu j ry ir-sO>[n>.1'<.. \u00bb',-\u2022 >\n.\n'\n\u2022\n'\n\u2022\n'\n\u2022 .<.\u2022:.\u2022'\u2022.; - i,i,'..
