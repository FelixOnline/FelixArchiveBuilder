    "content": "24 FRIDAY 21 FEB\nBOOKS\nEditor: Maciej\nMatuszewski, Eva\nRosenthal\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJoseph Henderson talks about the popular Picocon 31 guest\nI am writing about Charles Stross\nbecause of the upcoming Picocon\nscience fiction convention, which he\nwill be attending as one of the Guests\nof Honour. He has contributed to\nthe Science Fiction and Fantasy field\nwith his novels, his blogging, and his\nroleplaying work.\nOf these three things, the roleplaying\nwork is perhaps the least notable.\nStross worked on first edition Dungeons\nand Dragons, and created some of the\ngame\u2019s iconic monsters. Drawing from\nthe works of Moorcock and Martin,\nStross created the Githyanki: cruel\nand impious mind-controlling slavers\nthat lurk in underground caves and\nseek to kill their old racial enemies.\nThe Githyaki are still a part of D&D,\nand have appeared in the Neverwinter\nNights 2 and Baldur\u2019s Gate II computer\ngames, but Stross no longer writes for\nroleplaying games.\nStross (and various guests) also blog\non the popular antipope.org site on\nthe subjects of science fiction, Stross\u2019s\nconvention attendance, futurism, and\ninternational relations. Stross has also\nposted an autobiography on his blog,\nwhich I will not try to replicate here.\nStross can describe his life much better\nthan I can; this article is better used for\ncommentary.\nOn the topic of international\nrelations, Stross describes himself as\n\u201cjust an interested layman\u201d\n. His opinion,\nas a layman, is relatively informed and\nhis writing is populated by many links\nto other parts of the internet.\nFuturism is addressed in many\narticles, mentioning such topics as\nthe singularity, Bitcoin, the internet of\nthings, space colonisation, and a judge\nwho masturbated while sitting in court.\nStross manages to discuss futurism\nwith far more attention to evidence, so\nthe general quality of Stross\u2019s writing\nin these essays is better than in his\npolitical essays.\nLikewise, when Stross discusses\nwriting, and the publishing industry,\nhe does so as a knowledgeable insider.\nWhen Stross makes a statement about\npublishing or science fiction, he does so\nin a community that is interested in and\nfollows his words. His articles generate\ninterest, and almost every one of them\nwill have extensive commentary on\nother blogs.\nOf course, Stross\u2019s blog might never\nhave grown to such popularity were\nit not for his very notable writing. I\nhave not read all of his works, so I shall\nconfine my commentary to those that\nI have. For those who wish to read his\nworks many are available online, and\nalmost all published on paper can be\nfound in the science fiction library in\nthe Beit West Basement.\nCharles Stross won the Locus award\nin 2005 for writing the Accelerando,\na compilation of nine short stories.\nStross\u2019s technical skill as a writer was\nless developed in Accelerando than later\non, but his ideas are well worth reading.\nOver three generations the\ndysfunctionalMacxfamilylivesthrough\nthe transformation of human identity\nand society as technology transfers\nsentience from the natural brain to the\nsynthetic computer. As the series goes\non, each generation finds themselves\nfalling behind the more aware and\nefficient intelligences they create.\nStross is not particularly optimistic:\npeople are not necessarily protected\nfrom the future, and technology creates\na new economy, where posthuman\nintelligences ruthlessly exploit every\nresource they can find.\nFrom Accelerando, and those other\nStross novels that include them, my\nmost vivid memories are the sex\nscenes. His sex writing is not titillating,\nbut is generally useful for character\ndevelopment. The sex in Stross\u2019 novels\nis often out of the mainstream, and\nBDSM elements feature heavily. Seeing\nthe characters enjoy unconventional\nsex gives the reader an interesting\nexercise in empathy, giving a route to\nempathy through their private desires.\nThe Eschaton novels involve a space\nopera setting. Faster than light travel\nis developed, and can even be used for\ntime travel. However, the \u201cEschaton\u201d\n, an\nentity from the transhuman future, acts\nto prevent violations of continuity that\nmight threaten its own existence.\nNonethelessascolonieswithdifferent\ntechnology interact, causing huge\nculture shocks, desperate and ignorant\npeople take risks that put many worlds\nin danger. The plot of the novels is like\nthat of a spy thriller as UN agents try\nto avert catastrophe, while secondary\ncharacters describe the culture shock\nand transformation. Once again, the\nsex scenes are memorable, but I think\nthey are more like an out of place\ncomedy than important character\ndevelopment.\nThe Halting State duology are\npolice thrillers, set amongst the near\nfuture, post-independence, Scottish\npolice. This isn\u2019t a reflection of wishful\nthinking on the part of Stross for\nScottish independence, but an attempt\nto create a cool situation to write about.\nOn his blog Stross has complained that\nfar too much in the Halting State series\nseems to be coming true. The novelty of\nthe police using World of Warcraft to\nspy on criminals lost its lustre to Stross\nwhen he found out that the NSA did\nexactly that, so there will be no more\nCharles Stross\nCharles Stross \u2013 writer, blogger and king of the internet.\nWORM IN APPLE\n\u201c... Halting State\nis suffused with\nStross\u2019 wonderful\nimagination ...\u201d\n\u201c [The Atrocity Archives are] a very\namusing look at\nmodern bureaucracy struggling with\nmagical horror ...\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "11\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 21 FEB\nCOMMENT\nN\numbers. To the average\nImperial student, they\nare part of everyday\nacademia, to others\nthey are enthralling\nand engaging, but for some of us they\nrepresent a punitive regime by which\nwe live. Numbers are our self-worth,\nour being, our everything. Kilos,\ncalories, clothes size. Small numbers\nare our friends, zero is our deity. We\nare more common than you think: we\nhave eating disorders.\nEatingdisordersaffectapproximately\n1.6 million people in the UK yet they\nare still not understood by the masses.\nPersonally, I know of at least 4 people\nwho suffer, or have suffered, from an\neating disorder at Imperial, yet there\nis no support available or awareness\non campus. I struggle to understand\nwhy this is the case: Imperial is the\nperfect breeding ground for eating\ndisorders. It is high pressured and\ncompetitive; everybody strives to\nbe the best. Everybody wants to be\nperfect. Personally, I have found this\nenvironment triggering and earlier\nthis year found myself in the grips of\nanorexia once again.\nHaving an eating disorder is a\nterrifying and isolating experience\nno matter who you are. Nonetheless,\nbattling an eating disorder alongside\nthe gruelling workload and\nintense pressure of College life is\ninconceivably arduous. I simply could\nnot manage both, something had to\ngive. Studying requires concentration\nand cognitive clarity. Eating disorders,\nwhen unmanaged, abduct this. You\nbecome nothing more than a hollow\nshell consumed by consumption.\nFortunately, I was able to identify\nthe downwards spiral in which I was\ncaught and with the support of friends\nand family I chose to embark on the\npath to recovery. I felt ashamed; I\nhad come to university three years\nfree of treatment. I thought I was\nrecovered, how did I end up back in\nentrails of anorexia? It was a place I\nswore never to be again. I realise now\nthat this doesn\u2019t matter - what matters\nis that I identified the problem and I\nam making positive changes. I am\ntentatively embracing university life\nonce again. I am not recovered by any\nmeans, but I am in control.\nI wanted to write this article for\nEating Disorder Awareness Week\nnot only to raise awareness but to\nshare my story with others who are\nsuffering. To let them know that\nthey are not alone in this, that if they\nchose it, there is hope, and to share\nsome advice on how to survive at\nuniversity with an eating disorder. My\nfirst piece of advice is to speak out, do\nnot suffer alone. Telling other people\nis an important step in admitting\nyour struggles to yourself. Moreover,\nrecovering alone is impossible - my\nfriends have helped me so much,\nwithout them I\u2019d still be in a very dark\nplace. Secondly, think about what you\nwant from university. Having an eating\ndisorder not only affects your grades\nbut it also engulfs the whole student\nexperience. Do you want to look back\nand regret wasting \u2018the best years of\nyour life\u2019 staying in to avoid calories?\nMy third recommendation is to go to\nthe GP, get professional support. Do\nnot take no for answer. Do not go back\nwhen \u2018you\u2019ve lost more weight.\u2019 Early\nintervention is key, let the GP and\nyour demons know your problems\nare just as serious as anybody else\u2019s.\nFurthermore, I strongly suggest\nspeaking to your senior or personal\ntutor: it helps to remove some of the\nacademic pressure.\nFinally, make yourself rules.\nSensible ones, healthy ones and stick\nto them. Having a routine makes food\nmore manageable.\nThe road to recovery is a long one,\nit is far from smooth, and there are\ndays when giving up is so appealing.\nAt university there is nobody there\nto make you eat, to stop you from\npurging or tell you sit down. You have\nto take responsibility. You have to\nmake positive changes for yourself.\nYou have to recover because you want\nto, not because you are being forced.\nUltimately, you have to take control.\nEmily-Jane Cramphorn\nWriter\nEating Disorder Awareness Week\n2014 \u2013 It\u2019s Time to Speak Out\nFelix\nEditor-in-Chief\nAnother week passes...\nT\nhe weather is still horrid.\nSeriously, you\u2019d have\nthought that things\nwould have cleared up\nby now.\nAnyway, this week\u2019s been an\ninteresting one, with a hugely\nsuccessful \u201cRep Week\u201d, including\ntheRepConferenceonWednesday.\nWe also have another Photo of\nthe Week and more lonely hearts\nfrom Catnip :)\nIf you want to get involved with\nFelix, don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s not to\nlate to do so, all you have to do is\nsend us an email (there are email\naddresses all over the paper)\nand tell us how you want to get\ninvolved.\nUntil next time!\n\n"

And I don\u2019t\nmean the Big Elections.\nArtsFest sees our\nscientists\u2019 paradise turned over to\nour Artistic under culture for a week\nof something different.\nThe festivities this year include\nlunchtime concerts, an art exhibit,\nsinging, dancing, comedy, colour,\nnoise and fun. This will be at least\nthe 5th ArtsFest; records go back as\nearly as 2010, a time where, as far as\nArtsFest was concerned, even the\ninternet didn\u2019t exist. But it\u2019s been\ngrowing and learning every year.\nIn my tenure as Arts and Ents\nChair I\u2019ve already been impressed by\nso many talented clubs and societies\nperformances and I really hope as\nmany people as possible will seek out\nthis showcase of what\u2019s on offer.\nThe Blythe Gallery, for those that\ndon\u2019t know about it, is squeezed in\non level 5 of the Sherfield Building.\nIt\u2019s a lovely little arts space where\nPhotoSoc, LeoSoc and Calligraphy\nand Oriental Painting are putting\non a show with the theme of masks\nwhich runs for the whole length of\nthe festival. I try to make a point\nof heading up there every now and\nthen to see what\u2019s about, and to\ntake a moment to notice that not\nevery space at Imperial is used for a\nblackboard full of equations or some\nsort of lab. ArtsFest is the perfect\nopportunity if you\u2019ve not taken a\nlook before, just drop by any time for\na quick break or over lunch.\nIf you want something a little louder\nwe have plenty to offer you. In one\nof, in my opinion, the better college\ndecisions of late, we\u2019ve been given\nthe go ahead to shove IC Big Band\nout onto the balcony of the Queen\u2019s\nTower to blare out a few classics\none lunch time (1pm Monday 24th);\nand, for a slightly classier feeling,\ntry the String Ensemble Concert in\nthe Business School Foyer at lunch\n(12pm, 21st).\nAt the Union itself, MTSoc and A\nCappella will be showing off some of\nthe highlights of their year so far as\nwell as, if rumours are to be believed,\na few special new numbers they\u2019ve\nbeen working on (UCH, 7pm, 21st).\nBut for me I\u2019m particularly looking\nforward to the two final nights. On\nWednesday the 26th we\u2019ll be hosting\nthe ArtsFest Showcase, where dance\nand musical societies will be putting\non an extravaganza. On the 27th\nin Metric will be the light hearted\nArtsFest Afterparty where we will\nhave more dance, music, rock, and\nmuch more; hopefully including\nthe newly minted Imperial College\nComedy Soc as comp\u00e9res and\nperformers for the evening. Oh, and\nthe bar will be open\u2026 but you\u2019ll all\nonly be going for the performances,\nright?\nSo yes, the clubs in the Arts\nand Ents board have been busy.\nI\u2019ll probably be getting some hate\nmail now from the people I haven\u2019t\nmentioned: ICSO and Choir off\ndoing there epic performance of War\nRequiem at Winchester Cathedral\nfor instance, and the Imperial Fringe\nArts Experiment. So look busy,\nbecause what other excuse could you\npossibly have for not coming along?\nOh and before you start claiming\nyou\u2019d rather spend your money on\nSnakebites in 568 everything going\non on campus is going to be free,\nso that\u2019s 100% of your hard earned\nstudent loan being put towards the\nuniversal lubricant of science and\nthe arts.\nSo from Wednesday the 19th we are\ngoing to be going loud or going home\nall the way through to Thursday 27th\nof February. Come get involved and\nmake some noise!\nAlex Savell\nArts & Ents Board Chair\nArtsfest 2014, coming soon to a tower near you!\nThe Critic Laughs\nWhat: Richard Hamilton\nWhere: Tate Modern, SE1\nWhen: 13th February - 26th May\nPrice: \u00a314.50, concessions \u00a312.50\nR\nichard Hamilton. Father\nof pop art, experimenter\nof consumer design,\nright? If that is all you\nassociate with this icon\nof twentieth century British art, this\nmassive retrospective at the Tate will\nchange your mind. As far as it is even\nconceivable to encapsulate the works of\nan artist as prolific and far-reaching as\nHamilton into a single exhibition, this\nshowcase does a good job. To most of\nus, Hamilton is known simply as the\n\u201cfather of pop art\u201d\n, with the figure cutouts and domestic interior of his iconic\n1956 collage Just what is it that makes\ntoday\u2019s homes so different, so appealing?\nheralding a new era of art that draws\non popular culture as inspiration. This\nexhibition, however, offers us a glimpse\ninto the colossal scope of his work \u2013\nfrom his printmaking experiments\nas a student at the Slade to numerous\npolitical paintings to a roomful of\nPolaroid portraits of himself by other\nartists, we are introduced to a man\nwho was actively engaged with the\nworld around him and whose sense of\nadventure shone throughout his career\n\u2013 sometimes irreverently.\nIt is always interesting to see how\nan artist\u2019s work evolves over time; it\nreminds us that the creators behind\nare human, whose interests and values\ngrow and change. We are given the\nunique opportunity to observe the\ndevelopment of Hamilton\u2019s ideas and\ntechniques from his earliest works\nin the 1950s to his final painting,\ncompleted four days before his death\nin 2011. Organised chronologically into\neighteen rooms, each room shows a\ndistinct theme or period in Hamilton\u2019s\nartistic career.\nOf the multitude of artworks on\nshow, his installations are by far the\nmost intriguing. A cheerful jukebox\nmusic greets the viewer in a small\nroom dominated by the installation\nFun House, done in collaboration with\narchitect John Voelcker and artist\nJohn McHale for the 1956 exhibition\nThis is Tomorrow at the Whitechapel\nGallery. Blown-up film stills tower over\nus while wall-length optical illusions\ncrowd our vision; the sensory overload\ncompounded by a large crowd milling\nabout in the confined space. We are\nreminded, while looking up at Monroe\u2019s\niconic pose next to a cameo appearance\nof Van Gogh\u2019s sunflowers, of the\naesthetic value of media and everyday\nobjects.\nIt is for the catalogue of that\nexhibition that Hamilton created\nthe collage that is now recognised as\nthe first piece of pop art. For such a\nsignificant work, Just what is it\u2026 is\nsomewhat underwhelming, no larger\nthan a coffee-table book. The work\nitself is matter-of-fact \u2013 the male nude\ngazes impassively at you, in hand a\nlarge phallic lollipop while his domestic\nbackground is an uneasy collection\nof pop culture references. It is hard to\nbelieve that this was one of the first\nworks amalgamating ready prints and\ndrawing from consumer brands and\npop culture. Yet, the idea of painting\nover and embellishing ready prints\nwould underlie most of Hamilton\u2019s\nfuture works.\nHis fascination with the interior is\nexplored further in the installation\nLobby, which contains a wall-sized\npainting inspired by a postcard of a\nBerlin hotel lobby. The viewer walks\ninto the small room carpeted like in\nthe painting, and sees himself in a pillar\ncovered by mirrors, at once drawing the\naudience into the uneasy, sterile setting\nof the hotel lobby and blurring the lines\nbetween the viewer and the viewed.\nAt the end, we get the impression of\na man who changed with the times,\nalways eager to try out new techniques.\nFrom the cutting and pasting of his first\ncollage to the digital prints of Maps of\nPalestine (2009), which showed the\ndifference in Palestinian land area\nbetween the UN Partition Plan and\nthe actual extent of Israel-Palestinian\noccupation at time of printing,\nHamilton was a lifelong experimenter.\nHamilton\u2019s irreverence is refreshing.\nOne of my favourite pieces is The\nCritic Laughs, a product he created\nwhich mounts a pair of dentures onto\nan electric toothbrush. The actual\nproduct is on display, complete with\nits case, instruction manual and even\na hilarious commercial. Perhaps it is\nmerely tongue-in-cheek \u2013 or perhaps,\nHamilton is pointing out the rising\ncommercialism of our times and the\ncreation of useless products that are\nmarketed as essentials. The critic laughs\nat itself.\nHere was an artist who also actively\nengaged with the society around him.\nHis provocative political paintings span\nseveral rooms, with one of the most\nmemorable being that of Tony Blair\nin cowboy garb, standing over rough\nterrain with a pistol in each hand \u2013\nHamilton\u2019s way of protesting against\nBritish involvement in the second Gulf\nWar. Not one afraid to hide his strong\nopinions, Hamilton tackled subjects\nranging from a colourful disfiguration\nof Hugh Gaitskell, leader of the Labour\nParty in the 1960s, to his installation\nTreatment Room, a space reminiscent\nof NHS waiting rooms with Margaret\nThatcher\u2019s silenced election broadcast\nof 1983 being shown to a patient bed.\nCan the people be cured by the image\nof the ruler, and how powerful are mere\nwords which can be easily muted?\nThis retrospective also brings us\nto a deeply personal level with the\nroom \u201cPolaroids and Portraits\u201d\n, which\ncontains a wall filled with Polaroids\nof Hamilton himself, taken by fellow\nartists and friends. The artist does not\njust respond to his environment but\ninteracts with it as well in this unique\ntake on Hamilton\u2019s own person. In the\nsame space are Hamilton\u2019s portraits of\nclose friends Dieter Roth and Derek\nJarman \u2013 photorealistic faces touched\nby abstract, bold strokes.\nTheretrospectiveissovastsometimes\nit is slightly overwhelming. But it is\ndense with pieces that reflect the state\nof art and the world in the past 60 years\n\u2013 a must-see for anyone interested in\ncontemporary art and the life of an\nextraordinary innovator.\nJingjie Cheng\nWriter\nRichard hamilton 2005\n\n"

Clara Clark Nevola interviews theatre maker\nTom Espiner about the play Going Dark to find out\nD\noes the life of a man relate\nto that of a star? Going\nDark tells the history of\nthe universe as the story\nof how we perceive it,\ncreating a deeply human, emotional\nand immersive piece of theatre.\nThe play is centred round the life\nof Max, a planetarium astronomer,\nwho gradually loses his sight due\nto Retinitis Pigmentosa. His ability\nto work decreases, his relationship\nwith his young son changes, and his\nidentity as an individual is altered\nand questioned. Sound&Fury, a\ncollaborative theatre company, have\ncreated with Going Dark a startlingly\nimmersive experience, allowing the\naudience to enter the heart of the\ndeveloping Solar System, the mind\nof a blind man and the emotions of\na child.\nAfter its first UK tour last year,\nGoing Dark is returning to London\nwith a run at the Science Museum.\nI interviewed the co-founder of\nSound&Fury, Tom Espiner, to find\nout how Going Dark came to life and\nwhat the link between art and science\nis, and might become.\nHow did the idea for the play come\nabout? How did the link between\ngoing blind and space discovery\nemerge?\nIt\u2019s an idea which had been on our\nminds for a long time. There were\nseveral impulses but one of the first\nones was a real attraction for the\nbuilding of a planetarium: it\u2019s a tool\nfor education and helps our scientific\nunderstanding of the universe, but\nit\u2019s also a sort of secular temple, an\nintimate environment in which a lot\nof self-reflection happens. You\u2019re\nconfronted with the infinite, the very\nlarge, the wonderful.\nWe were also really interested in the\nidea of bringing together light, sound\nand darkness, all key elements of a\nplanetarium and of our own work.\nBecause of our previous interest in\ndarkness we wanted to create a play\nabout the senses and our perceptions,\nparticularly the hindering of visual\nperception.\nWe also started to find that there\nwere some interesting parallels\nbetween the way in which we, as a\nhuman race over millennia, have seen\nand understood celestial objects,\nthe scale of the universe, and the\ndynamics of light, with how we\nrelate to what we see in the world\naround us: a correlation between\ncosmological understanding and our\nown understanding of our daily lives\nas we interact with the world. So: life\nthrough the eye and universe through\nthe telescope.\nHow much of your play is based on\nscientific research?\nIt started with late Prof Richard\nGregory of the University of Bristol,\na neuropsychologist who spent his\nwhole life studying the relationship\nbetween the brain and the eye, and\noptical illusions. He\u2019d come to see\none of our previous plays and was\nreally interested in how in the dark we\ncould create images and sensations in\nour mind\u2019s eye.\nI also did a residency with\nBirmingham Physics and Astronomy\ndepartment for nine months,\nspeaking to various astronomers\nand physicists. As I was exploring\nwhat they were doing there I became\nnaturally interested in how vision\nworks, and how so much of the\nuniverse that we now understand and\nstudy does not rely on sight alone,\nusing instrumentation that sees\nwavelengths that we don\u2019t. I guess\nfor anyone who does science that\u2019s\njust par for the course, but it\u2019s still a\nvery wonderful thing to explore and\npresent to an audience.\nWe were funded by the Wellcome\nFoundation to work with experts in\ntheir field: we approached Dr Fitch,\na psychiatrist specialising in visual\nconsciousness and the hallucinations\noften brought on by loss of sight\n(Charles Bonnet syndrome), elements\nwhich were incorporated in our\nplay. We also spoke to RP Fighting\nBlindness, who gave us insights into\nthe details of going blind. Research is,\nand always has been, a major part of\nour work.\nTo what extent to you think that\nthe increasing public availability\nto scientific knowledge is making\npeople blind to its wonders?\nWe have a plethora of science\ncommunicators nowadays: I grew up\nwith Carl Sagan, who for me was one\nof the best science communicators\never, and of course Brian Cox is all\nover the place \u2013 instilling wonder for\nanyone who wants to see him on TV.\nInitially we thought we could get\nan astronomer to give a talk at the\nYoung Vic: the scientist as showman\nis a well-established model and it\u2019s\ngreat to see that, from Humphrey\nDavy on, that tradition is alive and\nwell. But we wanted to take a step\nin a different direction: we wanted a\nhuman element. Theatre is, as well as\na place to educate, a place of stories\nand a place of emotions, and we\nwanted to meet that challenge.\nIt\u2019s very difficult to achieve this, but\nwe wanted to intertwine a compelling\nstory with some good hard core\nscience facts, and finding a way in\nwhich they could relate to each other.\nAnd when you do that, you draw\ntogether audiences which wouldn\u2019t\nusually be together, all in the same\nroom, sharing a story and getting\ndifferent things out of it.\nThere\u2019s almost a tendency for\nscientists to become part of a sort\nof exclusive priesthood: they\u2019re in a\ngroup of people who, thanks to years\nof study, can understand things in\ngreat detail, and come to see great\nbeauty which often can\u2019t be explained\nto others, as a lot of mathematical\nknowledge is needed to appreciate it.\nSo it\u2019s really important that people try\nto communicate that by finding the\nright type of metaphor or language to\nenlighten us.\nDr Francisco Diego, vice president\nof the UK Association for Astronomy\nEducation gave one of the post-show talks and said that in our\ncharacter we had created someone\nwho instilled wonder like the old-school communicators did \u2013 a style\nof science communication which\njust isn\u2019t around as much anymore.\nWhich is a shame: evoking wonder\nand excitement about science is a\npowerful tool.\nCould Going Dark be a good model\nfor Science Communication in\nthe future? Or was this a one off\ninstance of science reflecting the\nhuman story you wanted to convey?\nI believe that the story comes first\nand foremost, and there must be\nplausibility in the emotional story. I\nthink it\u2019s a very good way of bringing\nscience understanding into the public\ndomain, but it\u2019s hard to achieve \u2013 a\nbalancing act. Audiences are smart\nand they will pick up on something\nbeing didactically rammed down\ntheir throat. I do think one should\nstrive to bring art and theatre\ntogether with science.\nGoing Dark has been described\nas \u201can Imax without the pictures\u201d\n,\nas it is an incredibly immersive\nexperience thanks to the sounds\nand minimal lighting you use.\nHow much does your work rely on\nadvances in technology?\nEver since we started we\u2019ve wanted\nto push the boundaries of the\ntechnological elements of theatre\n\u2013 partly because technology is\ngetting better all the time. It has\nto be used with caution as you can\neasily overdose; once again, the core\nelements of a good story are essential.\nThe more refined and delicate you\ncan be with sound and light, the more\ndetail you can bring out.\nSome people have described our\nwork as immersive theatre: the\nsound is spatialised and massive so\nthat the audience is actually plunged\nsonically into the scene, and we\nconjure up a sense of place, shared\nby audience and actors at the same\ntime. Our sound designer, Dan Jones,\nhas really studied how to achieve\nexactly the right reverb, harnessing\nthe audience\u2019s imagination and\ntransporting them to the scenes; all\nthe technology we use is there to\nserve the story. We would like our\naudience to think \u201cI was really there\u201d,\nnot to think \u201cthat sound technology\nwas excellent!\u201d\nGoing Dark will be performed at\nthe performance space of the Science\nMuseum from 5th-9th March 2013.\nTickets are \u00a320 for adults, \u00a38 for\nstudents, and are available from the\nScience Museum website.\nEDMUND COLLIER\nGoing Dark tells the emotionally gripping and visually immersive story of Max, a\nplanetarium astronomer with a young son, who gradually loses his sight.\n\n"

The\nfirst novel, also called Halting State,\nis suffused with Stross\u2019 wonderful\nimagination, with interesting \u201ccrimes\nthat don\u2019t even exist yet\u201d keeping the\nreader intellectually engaged.\nThe sequel, Rule 34, is much more\ndisappointing. The novel commits the\nsin of using \u2018evil sex\u2019 to characterise\nthe villain, which is dull, and relies on\nthis \u2018evil sex\u2019 extensively. Rule 34 also\nattracted critisism from Christopher\nPriest when it was nominated for a\nHugo. Priest\u2019s criticism was brief and\ndenigrating, so I mention it more\nfor the sake of history than because\nit is valuable. Naturally the criticism\ninspired plenty of discussion, and\nanyone wishing to particularly flatter\nStross might wear a t-shirt made in\nresponse, which bears the caption:\n\u201cINTERNET PUPPY NO CAN HAZ\nNOMS\u201d\n.\nEven more contemporary than the\nHalting State duology is the Laundry\nseries. The series is a very amusing look\nat modern bureaucracy struggling to\ndeal with magical horror; a modern\ntake on the Cthulu mythos\u2019 theme\nof \u201cknowledge that is too terrible to\ntell\u201d\n. The Laundry series loves to talk\nabout modern management and office\npolitics, and the struggle of an IT\nprofessional turned into a special agent.\nThe first novel, The Atrocity Archives\nis a good read if you like the idea of a\ntechnical professional griping about\nbad management and saving the world\nwith a few fantastic creatures thrown\nin.\nThe Laundry really gets interesting\nwith the second book in the series,\nThe Jennifer Morgue. The book is an\nintelligent and very aware parody of\nJames Bond novels. The Jennifer Morgue\nalso benefits from social commentary.\nIt questions and challenges the sexual\ncliche\u2019s of Flemming\u2019s novels and the\nstandards still held in many of the\ninspired works.\nMuch more subtle is the racial\ncommentary of The Jennifer Morgue. H\nP Lovecraft is rightly remembered as\nan excellent horror author, but modern\nreaders often choose to ignore the less\ndesirable underlying themes of his\nwork. Lovecraft was a racist and much\nof the horror of his work was based on\nhis fear of racial mixing, cultural decay,\ninherited evils and other discredited\nconcepts.\nIn Lovecraft\u2019s The Shadow Over\nInnsmouth (one of his best works), the\nfishy Deep Ones desire to interbreed\nwith humans. Their children carry\nthe unfortunate racial features of\ntheir parents, and eventually mutate\ninto undersea creatures. While some\ncritics have interpreted The Shadow\nOver Innsmouth as being about\nLovecraft\u2019s acceptance of racial mixing,\nand overcoming horror, The Shadow\nOver Innsmouth is still clearly about\nthe horror of being mixed race. To\nparaphrase George Orwell, while we\nmay dislike racism in Lovecraft\u2019s work,\nand wish it were not there, it would be\nabsurd to deny its existence. The Jennifer\nMorgue also uses the Deep Ones, but\nthe racial criticism is no longer directed\nagainst them, but against the prejudice\nthey receive for the circumstances of\ntheir birth.\nThe Jennifer Morgue is followed by The\nFuller Memorandum. This is much like\nThe Atrocity Archives, but in every way\nbetter. The alien intelligences are more\nintriguing, the office politics more\ndynamic and cutthroat, the action\nfaster and more exciting.\nThe Laundry series has also had\nseveral short stories published online. I\nwill not go into these in detail, save to\nsay that Equoid is absolutely excellent.\nIf, after reading this, you are interested\nin Charles Stross then I suggest you get\nonline and read Equoid.\nAt this point there is little left to say.\nStross has written many other books,\nbut unfortunately I have either not read\nthem or have nothing to say. This article\nwas written to give a summary outlook\nof Charles Stross\u2019s work, I have nothing\nto conclude. I hope that I have caught\nyour attention, and I look forward to\nseeing him at Picocon.\nIt\u2019s hard to decide whether Singularity Sky is hard or soft sci-fi. Inherent to the setting of the book is\nfaster-than-light (FTL) travel and\nan omnipotent, post-singularity AI.\nHowever that stuff is all really just\na backdrop to incredibly nerdy (and\ndelightful) discussions of spaceship-to-spaceship combat at\nrelativistic velocities, and a gleeful\ndissection of how FTL travel inherently leads to time travel. (The word\n\u201clight-cone\u201d is thrown around a lot.)\nIf that paragraph put you to sleep,\nthis book is not for you (also you\u2019re\nsilly). However, if you\u2019re the kind of\nperson who watches a space battle\nin Star Trek and goes \u201cwhy do all the\nships stop and stare at each other?\u201d\nor is annoyed by Star Wars\u2019 ubiquitous sound in space, then you should\ntravel at sufficient FTL speeds to\nensure you\u2019ve already read the book\nbefore starting this review.\nIt\u2019s clear that before a word of the\nbook was written, Stross took the time\nto think very carefully about how to\nreconcile FTL travel with time travel,\nconcluding that the only way to make\nit make any sort of sense is for there\nSingularity Sky\nTom Rivlin explores one of Charles Stross\u2019 most popular novels.\nto be an artificial ban on messing with\ncausality, as opposed to an inherent\nlaw of nature. Similarly, he clearly\nthought very hard about how ship-to-ship combat in space would actually happen, and does his best to stay\ntrue to that. Of course, the conclusion\nseems to be that ship-to-ship combat\nin space is a terrible idea and any civilisation who tries it and builds a massive space navy must be really, really\nstupid.\nOn that note, the story of the book is\nset in a post-singularity future, where\nhumanity has a galactic diaspora,\nwith many conflicting civilisations.\nAn engineer from Earth is doing routine contract work for a particularly\nrepressive and backwards empire, the\nNew Republic, when he, along with a\nUN spy, accidentally get caught up in\na space battle between the Republic\nand a mysterious,\ninformation-based civilisation called\nthe Festival. The story is light-hearted\nand fun, and the two main characters\nhave an interesting relationship, but,\nto me, it was mostly just window-dressing for the fun space battles.\nLike all good sci-fi, the book has\nsome smart things to say about how\nthe technology in it would impact\nsociety. In the book, different economic and political systems clash on\na galactic scale. Earth\u2019s embrace of\nnanotech which can replicate any ob-ject, and its subsequent transition to\na scarcity-free economy, is contrasted\nwith the Republic\u2019s strict ban on this\ntechnology, and its stasis in a good\nold fashioned 20th\ncentury dictator-ship. What\u2019s most engaging, though,\nis that neither side is presented as\nentirely better than the other. Earth\u2019s\npeople may have unlimited access\nto whatever they want, and have far\nmore freedom, but the price for that\nis terrorism on an unprecedented\nscale \u2013 on Earth, any nutcase with an\nagenda can unleash the worst kinds of\nplagues and atomic bombs. And you\nthought the Anarchist\u2019s Cookbook was\nbad.\nIt\u2019s clear we\u2019re meant to embrace the\nsingularity in the book (\u201cinformation\nwants to be free\u201d is a quote from the\nbook that appears on the cover), but\nStross emphasises that the singularity\ndidn\u2019t fix all of our problems. Like all\ntechnology, it also made more.\nSee Charles Stross at\nPicocon 31\nCharles Stross will be joined by Sarah Pinborough\nand Professor David Southwood on Saturday\nFebruary 22 at Imperial\u2019s annual science fiction\nand fantasy convention.\nPicocon 31 will feature Guest of Honour talks, a\npanel, silly games, quizzes and the destruction of\ndodgy merchandise with liquid nitrogen and a\ngiant hammer.\nThe convention is open to all and registration\nstarts at 10:00 in Beit Quad.\nFor more information, and to buy tickets, visit:\nicsf.org.uk/picocon\n\n"

Having\nto sit through at least 10 presentations\non exactly the same thing, whilst\nnoticing everything the other groups\nhad done better, was not only boring\nbut galling all at once. However, what I\nthought suspect about the whole thing\nwas the marking. Yes, I saw the nicely\nprepared marking sheet for the guest\nmarkers, but none of them ever filled\nthem out. Somehow too the groups\nwith the flashy presentations without\nmuch technical detail always seemed\nto do best (luckily for me\u2026.).\nThus, I was filled with a sense of\njustice when asked to help asses one\nof these days. I was going to mark the\nheck out of these kids, but what I was\nconcerned about was asking those\ntricky questions. I mean I never knew\nwhere they got them from. How did\nthey know about the agricultural industry in southern Chile? Seriously?\nSo having jotted down a few things\nrelating to the project, I headed on\ndown to see and hopefully destroy\nwhat they had come up with. But again\nthat irritating thing called compassion\nreared its friendly head. They were after all 1st years and looked scared out\nof their minds. As the first one started\nI looked down at my mark sheet to\nfind it was completely useless. Just\nthree boxes with content, style and\nclarity. How do you asses those things\nwithout seeing all of them first? Yet,\nI was determined to write something\nfor each group so got stuck in, even if\nmost of them there was just a \u201cgood\u201d.\nThe thing was they were in general\ngood. Though the familiar boredom\ndid slowly creep back after about six\nof them, it was not as bad as before. I\nhad not poured my blood, sweat and\ntears into it for the last few weeks so it\nConfessions of a GTA: Part 11\nwas rather interesting to see what they\nhad done differently. Yes some were\nmore flashy and enjoyable than others,\nbut only one was terrible. This group\nhad tried to source materials from a\nsmall Central America country where\nthe material does not actually exist.\nHaving been there and tried to find it\nmyself, I know. Surely that would be\non Google? When I questioned them\nabout it, they seemed to think the sustainability of this resource was more\nimportant than that it actually existing\nthere already. I think they were planning to impose a new million industry\non the poor locals within a week\u2026..\nThesestudentsobviouslygotmarked\ndown immediately, while those with a\nrather slick presentation that winged\nit a bit more conservatively got my\nvote. So the confession this week has\nto be if you are presenting something,\nmake sure your facts are straight. If\nyou don\u2019t know perhaps you should\n\u201clook into it later at greater detail\u201d. Or\nthere will be someone in the audience\nwho will tell you (perhaps very nicely)\nyou are an idiot.\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\nwinging it - deviantart.com\nReconciling science with poetry\nI\nam sat at a pew in Westminster\nAbbey, filled with a sense of awe\nand reverence. Unlike the elderly\nlady to my right, her hands\nclasped in silent petition, I am\nnot here for prayer. I am, however,\nhere on a pilgrimage of sorts in an\nattempt to understand the power and\nlimits of science.\nFive steps to my left and I will be\nstood over what remains of Charles\nDarwin. Four steps forward and I\nwill come face to face with the death\nmask of Issac Newton. But it will\ntake a keener eye to spot the object\nof my pilgrimage. Set neatly in the\nfloor between Newton and Darwin\nis a small, unremarkable stone square\nabout twice the size of my head. This\nis the nation\u2019s memorial to the greatest\nBritish physicist since Newton and the\nman behind much of the final year of\nthe physics MSci; Paul A. M. Dirac.\nI have come to pay homage and end\nup spending a while just sat watching\ntourists pass the stone. Despite its\nsimplicity this stone square is surely\nthe most effective and beautiful\nmemorial in the Abbey.\nKings, Queens and statesmen have\nrelied on the skill of artists to convey,\nperhaps fabricate, a sense of their\nimportance and success in life. Dirac\u2019s\nmemorial displays the power and\nbeauty of his life\u2019s work with just the\n6 letters that form his most famous\nequation; the Dirac Equation. This\nis his own handiwork, no one else\u2019s.\nTo describe in so precise a form\nthe motion and very existence of all\nfundamental particles of nature, the\nsame stuff of which we are made,\nis an act of uncommon genius. For\nDirac, however, it may also have been\nan uncommon act of sacrifice; the\ndedication of his life.\nI have with me, to aid my pilgrimage,\na copy of Dirac\u2019s Lectures on Quantum\nMechanics in which he lays out in just\n87 pages the mathematical ideas that\nlead to his equation. The ordering and\nlogic of Dirac\u2019s prose is impressive and\ncarefully chosen. If asked by a student\nto clarify a point during a lecture he\nwould simply repeat what he had said,\nword for word, and continue with the\nlecture. As far as he was concerned,\nhe had already expressed the idea as\nclearly as it could be stated.\nHe was just as inexpressive in his\npersonal life, speaking only when\nnecessary and answering with one\nword sentences. So private was he that\nmany of his closest friends never knew\nwhat his middle initials \u2013 A. M. \u2013\nstood for (it\u2019s Adrien Maurice). In this\nsense Dirac embodied his own subject\nof physics with his life. Direct and to\nthe point, never more than necessary.\nWandering further around the\nAbbey I find myself in Poets Corner,\nfinal resting place of Charles Dickens,\nAlfred Lord Tennyson and other\ngreats, and can\u2019t help but wonder who\nchose the better path in life. Certainly,\nthere would be some buried in Poets\nCorner who would be quite hostile\nto the work of the scientists buried\nnearby.\nThe clock strikes four and the\nsingers of the famous Westminster\nBoys Choir begin their daily service,\ntheir hymns reaching into every nook\nof the Abbey, exhorting listeners to\ndirect their attention to heavenly\nmatters. \u201cThere is no equation for the\nsalvation of your soul,\u201d they seem to\nsay, although such arguments would\nhold little sway with Dirac, an ardent\natheist and humanist.\nThe dead poets\u2019 concern, however,\nwould not be heaven but the heart;\nstrangled, they might say, by the\nconstraints of scientific rigour. This\nargument was most strongly made\nby William Wordsworth, himself\nmemorialised in the Abbey;\nSweet is the lore which nature brings\nOur meddling intellect\nMishaps the beauteous form of things\nWe murder to dissect\nPart stanza, part slap, this is a\ndirect attack on those who, like Dirac,\ndedicate their lives to science. When\nDirac uses his equation to dissect the\nuniverse, does he also murder it? Is a\nlife lived for science empty of beauty,\nof true meaning? Was Dirac\u2019s?\nThe question cuts to the very heart\nof what has been troubling me since\nthe end of my physics degree last year\nand what brings me here to the Abbey;\nwas all this science worth it? Hidden\nto most visitors, this debate seems to\nwage in the Abbey itself. The Romantic\npoets vs the materialist scientists. Can\nthey be reconciled?\nOscar Wilde, a much too outlandish\npoet to find himself in the sacred vaults\nof Westminster Abbey, famously\ndeclared, \u201call art is quite useless\u201d. He\nargued that it was beautiful precisely\nbecause of this uselessness, because\nit was done for its own sake, not\ncorrupted by practical concern.\nPerhaps the problem of science, and I\nknow this sounds strange, is precisely\nthe fact that it is quite useful. Often\nvery useful. There was never a disease\ncured by a novel nor a planet probed\nby a poem but in being useful, science\nruns a risk that art does not; that\nit ceases to be for its own sake. This\nmakes it better at attracting research\ngrants but could explain something of\nwhy science is seen as an ultimately\nunfulfilling pursuit by many.\nCan science be rescued? Is it possible\nto find the beauty of art within science?\nThe Bristolian commemorated by that\ndiamond-shaped stone could have\nsomething to teach us. Although\nquite literal minded and blunt in\nhis approach to life, Dirac\u2019s idea of\nscience was of science as an art, with\nmathematics his brush and his paint.\nHe taught students always to pursue\nbeauty in their work and would often\nreject proposed theories on the basis\nthat they weren\u2019t beautiful enough.\nHis approach to physics was to play\nwith abstract, pure mathematics and\nsee if any physics popped up. His\nunderlying belief, almost religious\nin its strength, was that the laws of\nnature should be beautiful and simple.\nDirac\u2019s field, quantum mechanics, is\nnotoriously complicated. Particles are\nalso waves, electrons are said to be in\nmore than one place at a time, even\nin more than one universe at a time.\nObtaining useful results from this\noften requires crude approximations\nand simplifications. It seems that at\nits most fundamental, physics is at its\nmost useless. This may be the spirit\nin which the heart of science can be\nrediscovered. Could science pursued\nfor its own sake, the less useful the\nbetter, be not just a way to better\nequations but to rediscover a sense of\nbeauty in the subject?\nThe choir has finished and I realise\nI\u2019m at risk of staying for a church\nservice. I perform one quick lap of\nthe Abbey before heading out into\nthe warm evening. I have no definite\nanswers but I wouldn\u2019t expect any\ncertainties when trying to understand\na quantum physicist like Dirac.\nNevertheless, my secular pilgrimage\nhas given me a glimpse of these Two\nTribes in silent war. Could Dirac\u2019s\nbelief in the beauty of physics and\nscience for its own sake provide a\nbridge between the two?\nMy head full of thoughts, I leave\nWestminster Abbey to its more\ntraditional pilgrims.\nRory Fenton\nColumnist\nhuffingtonpost.com\n\n"

It\nalso provides a great subject for banter\nwhen stealing your friends\u2019 chips\nbecomes the top priority in the pub.\nAs we near the end of the National\nChip Week, it is perhaps time to take\na deeper look into the world of chips.\nWhere did it come from?\nTo really understand the history of\nchips, we need to look into the \u201cmother\nhen\u201d \u2013 potatoes. It is believed that\npotatoes originated in the Andes of\nSouth America around 8000 years ago.\nTheSpanishconquistadorsbroughtthe\nvegetable back to Europe in 1536 and\nit was first grown in London in 1597.\nThe idea of deep frying chips was\nfrom France or Belgium. One of the\nstories is that it was invented by street\nvendors on the Pont Neuf bridge in\nParis in 1789, just before the French\nrevolution. The chips became a\nfundamental part of the American\nfast food thanks to Thomas Jefferson,\nwho served them in the White House\nduring his time in office between 1801\nand 1809, making it trendy at the time.\nIn Britain, the first chips were fried\nin around 1860 in Oldham, which is\nalso where the first Fish and Chip shop\nopened for business. British chips are\ncut much thicker and, since the surface\nto volume ratio is lower, they have a\nlower fat content. So next time when\nyou feel like something greasy, go for\nchunky chips; they\u2019re less bad for you!\nAre they really potatoes?\nWell, supposedly, yes. Traditionally\n(and still in practice by some\nrestaurants) chips are fried twice,\nonce to cook the potatoes and again\nto give it the crisp texture and golden\ncolour. Quite often most of us will\nfind frying a bit too much of a hassle,\nso that\u2019s where frozen chips come in.\nSold in most supermarkets\nnowadays, it is estimated that 80% of\nhouseholds in the UK buy frozen chips\nas a substitute to making them from\nscratch. These oven chips are sliced,\ndried and par-fried so that they are\ncrisp on the outside but remain raw\non the inside. This means the cooking\nprocess is a lot shorter and more\nconvenient for a weeknight meal.\nMost fast food outlets and some pubs\nand takeaways have seen this as a way\nto increase efficiency between order\nand plate and to minimise cost \u2013 for\nexample, McDonald\u2019s replaced fresh\ncut potatoes with frozen fries in 1967;\nothersfollowedsuitnotsoonafterthat.\nUnlike\u201cpowderedmashedpotatoes\u201d,\nthere is no evidence so far that there\nare chips on the market that are made\nfrom reformed potato starch, or other\ningredients that are totally unrelated,\nperhaps because it has to stay in the\nchip shape and therefore reducing the\nincentive for doing so. However, there\nare reports that Burger King started\nspraying a coat of starch to keep\nthe chips hot and crispy for longer.\nHomemade healthier chips\nSo one evening, we felt a crave\nof burgers and chips, so we made\nsome! If you feel like doing something\nsimple this weekend and don\u2019t feel\nlike buying pre-made \u201cstuff\u201d off the\nshelf, here is a quick recipe to cook.\nIngredients (for 1-2):\n- 1 small onion\n- 250g beef mince\n- 1 egg\n- 4 potatoes (depends how big your\nappetite is!)\nFor the burger, dice the onion and\nmix it with the beef and egg. Then\ndivide the mixture into two. With\nslightly wet hands, roll the mixtures\ninto balls sized around a tennis ball.\nSet in the palm of your hand and\ngently squeeze down to flatten into\npatties around 3cm thick. Make sure\nboth burgers are the same thickness\nso they cook evenly. Pan fry for\naround 5 minutes on both sides \u2013\ndepends how well done you like it.\nAs for chips, chop the potatoes into\nchip shape and boil for 3-5 minutes.\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter what potatoes\nyou use, but desiree potatoes are\nrecommended since they have a firmer\nand creamier texture \u2013 in this case, we\njust got a baking potato from the local\nsupermarket. Drain them and shake\nthem out onto a roasting pan, drizzle\nwith oil and season well. We added a\nbit of curry powder to spice things up\na bit, you can add any herbs and spices\nif you wish! Put it in the oven at 200\ndegrees for about half an hour, or until\ngolden brown and crisp. Don\u2019t forget\nto turn them at least twice to make\nsure they are crispy all the way round!\nSafety First!\nIf you do decide to fry chips this\nweekend, please remember never fill\nthe pan over a third full with oil or fat,\nand never be tempted to cook with\na chip pan after consuming alcohol.\nMichael Yat Kit Chung\nAlso, don\u2019t leave the pan alone with\nthe heat on, and be sure to cool down\nthe pan if the oil starts smoking.\nIf it does catch on fire, don\u2019t panic,\ndon\u2019t take risks and don\u2019t move the\npan. Never throw water or use a fire\nextinguisher on a hot fat fire and,\nonly if it is safe to do so, turn off the\nheat. Leave the kitchen, close the door\nbehind you, tell everyone else in the\nhome to get out.

That\u2019s crazy...\nChristopher Yates reveals Texas\u2019s invasive venom-proof \u2018crazy ants\u2019\nThe pseudoscience shaking the Shroud\nJames Bezer\nScience Writer\nC\nrazy ants may sound like\na Flappy Bird spin-off,\nbut in fact this species of\nant is slowly taking over\nTexas, thanks in part to\ntheir ability to neutralise the venom\nof fire ants.\nThe red imported fire ant, an\ninvasive species introduced to the\nUSA in the 1930s, has a fearsome\nbite that causes painful red irritations\nin humans and is used to kill other\ninsects. Their venom contains various\nalkaloids, which can lead to allergic\nreactions in some cases.\nWhilst most ant species are unable\nto displace the fire ants, crazy ants\ncan detoxify their venom, the fire ants\u2019\nmost powerful weapon. They do this\nusing formic acid, which they produce\nand rub on themselves whenever they\nare affected by venom.\nResearchers found that preventing\nants producing formic acid by coating\nthem in nail polish led to venom killing\naround half of the ants, compared to\njust 2% when the ants could produce\nthe acid.\nThanks to this acid defence, in 93%\nof the cases where fire ants and crazy\nants are competing for the same food,\nthe crazy ants will be successful. They\ncan even oust fire ants from their\nnests, giving the crazy ants a ready-made home to enjoy.\nUnfortunately, whilst fire ants can\nleave their mark with a painful bite,\nthey tend to stay in their nests and\nleave humans undisturbed. Crazy\nants, on the other hand, will nest in\nanything available, including cars\nor fuse boxes, where they can short-circuit electronics.\nHaving first arrived in Texas from\nSouthAmericain2002,crazyantshave\nspread throughout the state, causing\ndamages to wildlife and livestock, and\nannoyance to residents. Thankfully, it\nshould take a while for the crazy ant to\ncompletely take over the USA, as they\ncan only spread at a rate of around\n200m a year, although this can be\naccelerated if transported by humans,\nfor example by accidentally hitching a\nride in a car.\nCrazy ants aren\u2019t the only ants to\nuse formic acid, whose name comes\nfrom the Latin formica, meaning ant.\nSome ants spray or inject formic acid\nas a form of defence, while others even\nuse it as a herbicide. In the Amazon,\n\u2018devil\u2019s gardens\u2019, named because locals\nA\nlongside UFOs,\nhomeopathy and all\nmanners of conspiracy\ntheories, the Shroud\nof Turin has long\nbeen known as a perennial source of\npseudoscience. It has almost certainly\nlived up to its well-earned reputation\nthis week. An army of journalists\nhave flooded the internet with stories\nabout a new paper explaining why\nradiocarbon dating may not have\ngiven the \u201cright\u201d answer when aging\nthe religious icon. It already sounds\nsuspicious, doesn\u2019t it?\nFor anyone who doesn\u2019t know, the\nShroud of Turin is a burial shroud that\nhas the outline of a person imprinted\non it, and is believed by some to have\ncovered Jesus after his crucifixion. In\n1988, carbon dating on the shroud\nconcluded that it originated from\naround the 14th\ncentury, considerably\nlater than the accepted lifetime of\nChrist. This, one might assume, should\nhave been the end of the matter.\nNot for Alberto Carpinteri,\nhowever. In his paper, published in\nthe journal Meccanica (of which he is\nthe editor-in-chief), he suggests that\na huge number of neutrons released\nby an earthquake in 33AD may have\ndisrupted the ratio of carbon isotopes\nand led to a much more recent\nestimate of its age.\nThe idea of a large neutron flux\naffectingtheshroudwasfirstdiscussed\nin the letters pages of Nature in 1989,\nbut Carpinteri is the first to put\nforward a possible explanation for how\nit may have arisen. His theory relies\non something called \u201cpiezonuclear\nfission\u201d, a phenomenon where\nenormous numbers of neutrons can\nbe released by applying mechanical\nforces to rocks, supposedly causing\niron nuclei to break apart. Carpinteri\nis definitely a world expert on this: he\ncame up with the idea several years ago\nand still may well be the only scientist\nwho believes it to be compatible with\nthe laws of physics.\nAside from the suspicion that\nthis paper may partly have been\na (remarkably successful) way of\ngetting more publicity for the author\u2019s\nfavourite theory, there are more\nfundamental problems with the idea\nof neutrons affecting the Shroud.\nWhen it was suggested in 1989 by\nR.E.M. Hedges, one of those who first\nperformed the carbon dating on it,\nhe argued that why wasn\u2019t everything\nelse in the region also affected and\nwhy did his team just happen to\nget an apparently wrong date that\ncorresponded with the earliest\nhistorical records of the Shroud?\nIn the greater scheme of things,\nstories like this are pretty irrelevant,\nbut they highlight an important issue\nabout science in the media. This story\nhas been covered by several major\nnews organisations including The\nHuffington Post, The Independent,\nThe Telegraph, USA Today and,\nobviously, The Daily Mail. These\nare all respected news outlets (OK,\nmaybe not The Mail...), and yet their\njournalists still can\u2019t be bothered to\ndo a bit of background reading before\npublishing an article. In this media\nculture obsessed by headlines and\ngood stories over factual accuracy,\nhow can the lay readers possibly get\nan informed view of the truth behind\nany science story?\nbelieve they house evil spirits, are\nareas containing only lemon ant trees.\nLemon ants inject formic acid into\nthe leaves of other trees in the area,\nleading to the leaves dying. The ants\ncan cultivate their preferred trees over\nareas up to 1,300m2\n, with colonies of\nover 3 million worker ants.\nA 14th\ncentury selfie?\nTEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY\n\n"

Director Quentin\nTarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir\nDogs, Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds)\nhas truly outdone himself getting\nsomeone like me to enjoy such a film.\nI usually go for the girly, often vom-inducing films, as evidenced by some\nof the more embarrassing entries on\nmy list (Les Mis, The Great Gatsby,\nThe Heat etc) and yet Django is the\none that stays with me after all this\ntime (this was released way back in\nJanuary 2013).\nIt\u2019s a 165-minute long epic of a freed\nslave on a mission to rescue his wife.\nPacked with excellent performances\n(from Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz\nand of course, my fav Leonardo\nDiCaprio), wonderfully written\nwordy script, and an unforgettable\naction sequence to wrap it all up, this\nwas an easy decision.\nNick Frost finally gets his first lead\nrole in a film. That\u2019s pretty much the\nmain point of Cuban Fury, and easily\nthe strongest reason to either see it or\nhear of it. Hence why I said it first. No\npoint in wasting words, really. Which\nI\u2019m totally not. Honest. Maybe a little\nbit. Over-extended joke aside, seeing\nFrost finally take stage is definitely the\nbest thing about Cuban Fury. It\u2019s got\na strong central trio, all with backgrounds in some of the best comedies\nfrom either side of the Atlantic (IT\nCrowd for Chris O\u2019Dowd, Parks and\nRecreation \u2013 quite possibly the greatest show about government not to feature Malcolm Tucker (which is a stupidly long way of saying \u2018best political\nsatire outside of The Thick of It\u2019) \u2013 for\nRashida Jones, and the Cornetto Trilogy for Frost).\nUnfortunately, none of the three really feel like they\u2019re being played to\ntheir respective strengths. O\u2019Dowd\u2019s\nnew position as Hollywood\u2019s favourite\nIrishman (Thor is a huge step-up from\nThe IT Crowd whichever way you look\nat it) combined with (what can only be\nread as) a need to avoid type-casting\nleaves him playing an utter asshole,\nin sharp contrast to his previous self-absorbed but harmless selves, and it\nmeans some of Cuban Fury\u2019s humour\nhas an oddly nasty streak in his digs\nat Frost\u2019s adorable Bruce. Some of his\nquips are mildly amusing, but they\u2019re\nmostly just mean and (while it\u2019s obviously intended to make us dislike him)\ncan\u2019t help but briefly alter the overriding sense of positivity into something\u2026 less positive. Jones, mean-while, gets handed her mostly straight\nrole from Parks, where she plays off\nagainst the ever-amazing Amy Poehler, except she\u2026 doesn\u2019t really get\nanyone to play off. She feels kind of\nwasted, to be honest. Just a pretty love\ninterest who can dance.\nWhich does bring us rather neatly on\nto Cuban Fury\u2019s strongest element besides the existence of Frost (who also\nfeels wasted, for the record \u2013 he came\nup with the idea in a drunken email\nto a producer, and on paper it\u2019s great,\nbut without Simon Pegg or the usual\nabsurdly high quantities of genius\nthat go into their scripts to work with\nhe feels a little undercut by the weak\nscript he\u2019s given here) \u2013 the dancing.\nIt\u2019s great. Smartly shot to disguise the\nuse of body doubles at various points\n(although there are moments where\nit\u2019s quite clearly not the various actors\ninvolved), it\u2019s the source of all the best\nmoments in the film \u2013 the roof-top\ndance-off between Frost and O\u2019Dowd\nis the film\u2019s highlight, by far, and the\nfinal competition scenes are a visual\ntreat \u2013 but for a film built around\nthe concept there\u2019s surprisingly little\nGetting hot in here\ndancing. Which is a bit disappoint-ing, really. It\u2019d have been quite nice to\nsee something that wasn\u2019t just another\nbloody Step Up film. Which are great\nif you like dancing, but terrible if you\nlike pretty much anything else that a\nfilm needs to be even bearable. Like\nacting. Or a story (unless you count\n\u2018DANCING\u2019 as a story in which case\nyou are either a) an idiot b) overly obsessed with dancing c) someone who\ndoesn\u2019t know what \u2018story\u2019 actually\nmeans or d) just trying to wind me\nup, in which case: fair play to you. Just\ndon\u2019t do it again, because you\u2019re only\nmaking yourself look silly)).\n\u201cA bit disappointing, really\u201d essentially sums up Cuban Fury. The supporting cast are almost wasted \u2013 Olivia Coleman appears, disappears,\nthen pops up again later without really getting a chance to make an im-pression, Rory Kinnear is just kind of\nthere sometimes, and while Kayvan\nNovak is a great new discovery when\nyou realise his character mostly consists of openly embracing a stereotype\nthe jokes start to fall somewhat flat.\nWhich, again, sort of sums up Cuban\nFury. It\u2019s a film that means so well, and\nhas such a great cast, that it can\u2019t help\nbut make you smile, meaning it manages the dubious feat of somehow being funny without being funny. It feels\nvery much like a missed opportunity,\nbut one that\u2019s still probably worth a\nwatch if you\u2019re looking for a harm-less, smile-inducing rom-com. It\u2019s far\npoliter than That Awkward Moment,\nand it\u2019s far from being as terrible as the\nmajority of rom-coms (a genre with\nmore than its fair share of utter trash),\nbut it\u2019s no (500) Days of Summer or\nDon Jon. Which is a shame, really. It\ncould have been so much more.\n10. Blue Jasmine\n9. Nebraska\n8. Philomena\n7. Zero Dark Thirty\n6. Django Unchained\n5. Lincoln\n4. Gravity\n3. Before Midnight\n2.

It is located\non Exhibition Road, South Kensington, London, SW7 2BB. It is a science and technology\ncentre, plus it is free!\nWhat I have experienced at the Science Museum in the Space section is the way the\ninformation was presented; they have captions, photographs, diagrams, models, even\ntelevisions. I myself think that this is a good way to present information.\nThis area appeals to adults because it doesn\u2019t give lots of information, it gives a good amount of it,\nto fit in pictures and displays; and it is also much clearer to understand.\nThis area also appeals to younger people by giving them displays and models to help them\nunderstand what they are reading about.\nThe Earth display has to be the best display in the Apace area because it is the main attraction plus\nit gives us the most information.\nThey have extra facilities in the space room like seats, information pads, safety barriers and a\nbackground image to create the effect of space. They are very good facilities for both adults and\nchildren.\nWhat I enjoyed the most about the Science Museum was the different facts they gave about space,\nbecause it helped me to gain knowledge about space.\nWhat I think could be improved is maybe to make it even darker than it already is and hang some\nplanets from the ceiling such as Jupiter and Saturn. That would make it look more realistic.\nI would recommend the Science Museum to someone else because there is so much to see and\nlearn about science and technology; for free!\nScience Museum review by Ibrahim\nand Sadiqul\nW\ne were reviewing the Energy section of the Science Museum. The subject of the\ngallery is Energy. There were activities and educational, interactive games, this\nmakes you interact with the gallery more. It makes adults walk around and look\nat it. The gallery makes teenagers and university students take part and learn.\nThe gallery teaches you how energy is useful and how to make it. The Science\nMuseum facilities are very good; they have 3D and IMAX cinema, cafes, toilets, shops and a theatre.\nThe thing we enjoyed most was the electric pole that zaps you if you touch it with your fingernail. We\nalso enjoyed meeting Michael Faraday, he showed us the plasma ball, when you turn it on there are\nzaps of energy, and if you touch it there is one massive shockwave.

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 21 FEB\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCommunist Manifesto Turns 166\nT\no celebrate the 166th\nanniversary of the\npublication of the\nCommunist Manifesto,\nI shall be writing a three\npart series on the Manifesto: on its\ntheoretical contents, on its history\nand impact and on its flaws and its\nposition in Marxist thought. What\nshould never be forgotten about\nthe Manifesto is that it contains a\nspecific political program and its\nstyle, brash and powerfully polemical,\nreflects this. It is also, as Marx and\nEngels pointed out, in many ways\nantiquated. Of course, it deserves\nremembering on account of nothing\nother than its historical importance;\nbut the Manifesto is more than an\ninteresting historical relic: it retains\nin broad outline the most profound\nunderstanding of the movement and\ntransition of societies in history.\nThus it is as a relevant political text\nthat I shall make this exposition. This\njustifies, in my view, the exclusion of\nthe final two sections of the book,\nSocialist and Communist Literature,\nand Position of the Communists\nin Relation to the Various Existing\nOpposition Parties. These sections\ndeal with historically specific matters\nthat require discussion but not\nnecessarily representation. This is true\nto some degree for the second section,\nbut it is here the problems with the\nManifesto are concentrated and so\nshall be presented in the interest of\nparity.\nBourgeois and Proletarians\nIf one wanted to express the essence\nof historical materialism in one line,\nnobody puts it better than Marx:\n\u2018the essence of all hitherto existing\nsocieties is the history of class struggle\u2019.\nMarx then goes on to emphasise that\nthe development of the bourgeoisie\nhas polarised previously complex\nclass societies into the opposition\nbetween proletariat and bourgeoisie.\nThen after a brief description of the\nactual (economic) development of the\nbourgeoisie, Marx then links this to\npolitics: \u2018Each step in the development\nof the bourgeoisie was accompanied\nby a corresponding political\nadvance of that class\u2019. This political\nadvance has not been peaceful: \u2018The\nbourgeoisie, historically, has played\na most revolutionary part\u2019, \u2018it has\npitilessly torn asunder the motley\nfeudal ties that bound man to his\n\u201cnatural superiors\u201d\u2019. Marx\u2019s tone is\nambiguous, so while \u2018[the bourgeoisie]\nhas accomplished wonders far\nsurpassing Egyptian pyramids\u2019 it has\nalso substituted \u2018exploitation, veiled\nby religious or political illusions,\n[with] naked, shameless, direct, brutal\nexploitation.\u2019\nThen we come to the first central\npoint of the analysis: \u2018the bourgeoisie\ncannot exist without constantly\nrevolutionising the instruments of\nproduction, and thereby the relations\nof production\u2019. The reason for this lies\nin the development of the bourgeoisie:\n\u2018At a certain stage in the development\nof [feudal] means of production and\nexchange \u2026 the feudal relations of\npropertybecamenolongercompatible\nwith the already developed productive\nforces; they became so many fetters.\nThey had to be burst asunder\u2019. But the\nvery productivity of the bourgeoisie\nbecomes its own downfall, \u2018the\nepidemic of over production\u2019 leads\nto more or less periodic crises that\nbeset it which \u2018[put on trial] the\nexistence of the entire bourgeois\nsociety.\u2019 The crisis can be overcome by\nthe \u2018inforced destruction of a mass of\nproductive forces\u2019 or by the \u2018conquest\nof new markets.\u2019 Thus \u2018the need of a\nconstantly expanding market chases\nthe bourgeoisie over the whole face of\nthe globe\u2019 and \u2018it compels all nations,\non pain of extinction, to adopt the\nbourgeois mode of production \u2026 it\ncreates a world after its own image.\u2019\nMeanwhile, \u2018in the same proportion\nas the bourgeoisie, i.e. capital, is\ndeveloped in the same proportion\nis the proletariat.\u2019 This occurs as\nthe lower middle class sinks to the\nlevel of the proletariat, outpaced\nby machinery and out-bought by\nlarge industry. The proletariat, \u2018must\nsell [itself] piece-meal, [and is] a\ncommodity, like every other article of\ncommerce\u2019. Also, the efficient division\nof labour and the development of\nmachinery have reduced the dignity of\nwork to a mere mechanical procedure,\nthus alienating the workers from\nthemselves. With the development\nof industry and the concentration of\nthe means of production (in factories\netc.,) the proletariat becomes more\nnumerous and more class-conscious,\nthough things do not always go\nso smoothly: \u2018This organisation of\nthe proletarians into a class \u2026 is\ncontinually being upset again and\nagain by the competition between the\nworkers\u2019.\nHowever, all revolutionary hope\nrests in the hands of the proletariat.\nFor the bourgeoisie, the proletarian\nis the only necessary class because\nwhile \u2018the other classes decay and\ndisappear in the face of Modern\nIndustry; the proletariat is its special\nand essential product\u2019. Furthermore,\nas the \u2018proletarian is without property\u2019\nthey \u2018cannot become masters of\nthe productive forces of society,\nexcept by abolishing their own\nprevious mode of appropriation\u2019.\nThus while every previous revolution\nhas \u2018but established new classes,\nnew conditions of oppression\u2019, \u2018the\nproletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of\nthe immense majority, in the interest\nof the immense majority.\u2019\nThus in summary: \u2018Hitherto, every\nform of society has been based \u2026 on\nthe antagonism of oppressing and\noppressed classes.\u2019 This antagonism is\nthe dialectic that provides the motor\nforce to history which has led \u2018either\nto a revolutionary re-constitution of\nsociety at large, or in the common\nruin of the contending classes\u2019.\nThe bourgeoisie has distinguished\nitself as the most revolutionary\nclass to date. However it remains\nan oppressing class whose very\nrevolutionary tendency leads to an\nintrinsic instability in the capitalist\nmode of production. Simultaneously,\nthe industrial proletariat proliferates\nas the bourgeois mode of production\nspreads and polarises class\nantagonism, while it organises and\nbecomes more conscious as it is forced\ninto association through economic\ncentralisation. The bourgeoisie need\nto exploit the industrial proletariat\nfor their own survival, yet they no\nless need to force the proletariat\ninto a position where it will develop\nits class consciousness and resist\nthis exploitation. This immanent\ncontradiction in the bourgeois mode\nof production will \u2018inevitably lead to its\nfall and the victory of the proletariat\u2019.\nProletarians and Communists\nThe main value of this chapter is\nthat it highlights some of the more\nsustained failures of Marxism. It is\nonly appropriate to present them here,\nthough detailed discussion will be\ndelayeduntilmythirdarticle.However\nit also serves to qualify the Marxist\nrelation to property. Many who lack\nconceptual clarity, both Marxist and\nnon-Marxist, confuse the \u2018bourgeois\nsocialist\u2019 Proudhon\u2019s \u2018Property\nis theft\u2019 with Marxist doctrine.\nHowever, Marx is very careful to\npoint out: \u2018the distinguishing feature\nof Communism is not the abolition of\nproperty generally, but the abolition\nof bourgeois property\u2019. That is, it is\nnot so much property that is theft as\nthe private ownership of the means\nof production (and exchange). Thus,\nwhen \u2018We Communists\u2019 are accused\nof wanting to abolish \u2018Hard-won,\nself-acquired, self-earned property!\u2019,\nMarx ironically states that \u2018there is no\nneed to abolish that; the development\nof industry has to a great extent\nalready destroyed it\u2019. Similarly, \u2018You\nare horrified at our at our intending\nto do away with private property.\nBut in your existing society, private\nproperty is done away with for nine-tenths of the population \u2026 In a word\nyou reproach us with intending to do\naway your property. Precisely so; that\nis what we intend.\u2019 This conclusion\nis based on the antagonism between\n\u2018capital\u2019 and \u2018wage-labour\u2019 which, in\nthe forms presented in the Manifesto\nlack conceptual clarity. This will be\nfurther discussed in my third article.\nTwo areas where (classical)\nMarxism has continually proved\ndeficient are in its relation to women\nand in its explanation of the national\nphenomenon. The discussion of the\nfamily in this section is ultimately\nof little interest, roughly taking\nover the conclusions of Free Love\nadvocates in France and Britain, more\nthoroughly dealt with in Engels\u2019 The\nOrigins of Family, Private Property\nand the State. However, it is worth\nremembering that, via Engels, Marxist\ntheory had at least some recognition\nof the oppression of the greater\npart of humanity. Meanwhile, the\ncomments in the Manifesto on the\nnation and nationalism are from a\nclearly internationalist position which\ntoo easily dismisses the efficacy of\nnationalism as an ideology.\nThis yields a third, and perhaps more\ngeneral, deficiency in Marxist theory,\nthe inability to properly explain the\nrole of ideology in the development\nof history. Though we have in brief\nthe theory of reification: \u2018the selfish\nmisconception which induces you\nto transform into eternal laws of\nnature and of reason, the social forms\nspringing from your present mode of\nproduction\u2019, we also have the rather\ntoo simple: \u2018What else does the history\nof ideas prove, than that intellectual\nproduction changes its character in\nproportion as material production\nchanges\u2019. It is claims like these which\nare at the bottom of many of the\naccusations of \u2018economic essentialism\u2019\nlevelled at Marx. This is a real issue\nwhich requires discussion, and I shall\nattempt to do so in my third article.\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nwikia.com\n\n"

    "content": "30 FRIDAY 21 FEB\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBest film of all time?\nCitizen Kane follows the story of a\njournalist trying to piece together the\nlife of Charles Foster Kane and try to\nfigure out what his final word, \u201cRosebud\u201d, meant. It has been critically acclaimed and has often been labelled\nthe best film of all time by many.\nIf one has never seen the film before;\nit is difficult to view it without thinking \u201cAm I enjoying this enough considering it\u2019s the best film of all time?!\u201d\nMoments when the film lulls a little\nyou begin to wonder whether you are\njust not getting it. These things are\nhard not to think about. On top of this\nthere are so many tropes and lines of\ndialogue that have been parodied and\npastiche\u2019d in modern cinema it can be\ndifficult to concentrate. Whether the\nmusical number that has been parodied by The Simpsons or the famous\nending which pops up just about\ndamn everywhere.\nI have to say despite these reservations I did very much enjoy the film,\nbut probably laughed a few more\ntimes than Welles intended due to a\nweird anachronistic call-back humour\nfrom the parodies.\nThough worry if I didn\u2019t enjoy would\nI ever say? Could it all be a giant case\nof the Emperor\u2019s new clothing? Am I\ndeceiving myself? Did the critic James\nAgate get it right in 1941 when he said:\n\u201cI thought the photography quite\ngood, but nothing to write to Moscow\nabout, the acting middling, and the\nwhole thing a little dull.\u201d\nAre we watching this movie for the\nsame reasons that people feel compelled to queue for a few hours to see\nMona Lisa in the Louvre? Just because\nwe\u2019ve been told it\u2019s the best. They are\nboth highlights in their art form, but\ndo people enjoy them or just want to\nbe able to say \u201cBeen there, done that\u201d?\nI think it is problematic to try and\nhold one film up as \u201cThe Best\u201d, as it\ndoes a disservice to many other films\nthat might be enjoyed as much or\nhave just as much merit in their era.\nIt also acts as a distraction from the\nenjoyment of the film, though it is\nalways difficult to recommend films\nwithout leading the person viewing\nto think about them in a certain way.\nSometimes the best films are the ones\nwhich you knew nothing about before\nstarting. My first memory of The Shining was channel-hopping and seeing a\nmovie starting and thinking \u201cthat\u2019ll\ndo\u201d. Only to totally blown away by it.\nMaybe there just needs to be more\nways to access good film blindly.\nIt would be great if Netflix were to\nintroduce a random classic movie but-ton, it might help me finally help me\nget over this problem.

Contact us now!\nChelsea vs. Everton\n(BT Sport 1, Saturday 12:45pm)\nEverton remain in the hunt for Champions League football but a few lacklustre performances of late have\njeopardised their chances. Roberto\nMartinez\u2019s men have had longer to\nprepare but without Romelu Lukaku,\nthey lack that all-important cutting\nedge. With recent draws against West\nBrom and West Ham, Jose Mourinho\nhas already spurned two chances to\nopen up a gap at the top of the table,\nand he will allow no room for complacency here.\n2-1\nCrystal Palace vs. Man United\n(Sky Sports 1, Saturday 5:30pm)\nIn some ways, David Moyes will be\nrelieved to have a spell of games away\nfrom Old Trafford, as his position\nalways seems to come under much\nmore scrutiny when the champions\ndrop points at the Theatre of Dreams.\nHowever, United come up against a\nrejuvenated Eagles side who have won\ntheir last three games at Selhurst Park,\nand a win here could see the Eagles\nrise as high as 10th. That might be asking a bit much of Tony Pulis\u2019 men but\nUnited may struggle to see this over\nthe line.\n1-1\nLiverpool vs. Swansea\n(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 1:30pm)\nThe Swans look to have regained some\nbelief under Garry Monk and will not\ngive the Reds as easy a ride as they\nenjoyed in the corresponding fixture\nlast season, which finished 5-0 to the\nhosts. That said, the Sturridge-SuarezSterling attacking threesome looks\nunstoppable at the moment. Michel\nVorm has not kept an away clean sheet\nsince September and I don\u2019t see things\nimproving for him here.\n3-1\nBest of the rest (Saturday 3pm unless otherwise stated)\nNewcastle vs. Aston Villa\n(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 1:30pm)\nVilla\u2019s record at St James\u2019 Park is atrocious but the Magpies are on their\nJames White\nFootball Columnist\nsummer holidays three months early\nand with their outstanding away form,\nPaul Lambert will see this as a brilliant\nopportunity to return to the top half.\n1-2\nNorwich vs. Tottenham\n(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 4pm)\nSpurs have won 7 of their last 8 away\ngames and are hot on Liverpool\u2019s heels\nin the battle for Champions League\nfootball. The Canaries have deserved\nmore from recent games and will give\nit their all but are not in the same\nleague.\n0-2\nArsenal vs. Sunderland\nThe Gunners might be starting to run\nout of steam after a torrid run of fixtures which culminated with a gargantuan clash against Bayern Munich on\nWednesday night. Gus Poyet\u2019s Black\nCats will look to extend their exceptional run of away form and could\nspring a surprise.\n1-1\nCardiff vs. Hull\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s appointment\nhas yet to work out for the Bluebirds,\nwho sit just 1 place off rock bottom. A\nfew weeks back, the Tigers looked to\nbe on a glass slope with slippers on but\nSteve Bruce has stopped the rot with 4\npoints from 6 and they can make it 5\nfrom 9 here.\n1-1\nMan City vs. Stoke\nThe Citizens looked so indomitable\nuntil their defeat to Chelsea that recent Premier League results can only\nbe a blip. The Potters simply do not\ndo away wins and Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s\nmen will surely return to winning\nways. 2-0\nWest Brom vs. Fulham\nCottagers owner Shahid Khan pressed\nthe panic button in sacking Rene\nMeulensteen last weekend and Felix\nMagath starts with a relegation six-pointer. After their draw versus Chelsea, I fancy the Baggies to go on a bit\nof a run, starting with 3 points here.\n2-0\nWest Ham vs. Southampton\nThree 2-0 wins in a row have seen\nthe Hammers rise from 19th to 10th\nbut they will struggle to make it four\nagainst a Saints side playing with real\nflair of late.\n1-1\nMIKE HEWITT/ GETTY IMAGES\nHeadline Sponsor\n58 TEAMS 29 MATCHES\n11 SPORTS 1 WINNER\nicsm vs. ic\n#impvarsity\nARSITY\n12.03.14\nbuy match tickets at\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/sports/varsity\n\n"

My friend and I slept together (as\na one-off), and we didn\u2019t use a condom\nbecause I\u2019m on the pill. At the time I\nwasn\u2019t worried, because he\u2019s never\nseemed like the type to sleep around.\nHowever, since then, I\u2019ve heard that\nhe\u2019s been sleeping around, and now\nI\u2019m worried that I might have caught\nsomething. Should I be worried?\nRisky in Ruislip\nIt\u2019s always best to get checked after you\nhave unprotected sex with someone,\nbecause you can never tell from a\nperson what they might be carrying.\nIf this person had unprotected (from\nSTIs) sex with you in this context, you\ncan reasonably assume that they will\nhave had unprotected sex with others.\nThis only increases the risk to you, so\nit\u2019s really important that you make\nsure that you get tested before you\nhave unprotected sex with any further\npartners.\nHelp! I\u2019ve been seeing someone for\na month or so, and we text a lot and\nspend a lot of time together, sleeping\ntogether a couple of nights a week.\nWhenever I try to talk to her about\nour relationship, she always changes\nthe subject. I know that she\u2019s really into\nme, how can I convince her to put a\nlabel on it?\nUndefined in Upminster\nWhile at first it might seem like if\nyou just wait, your status will become\napparent, if it\u2019s got to the point where\nit\u2019s bothering you, you need to talk\nto her. She\u2019s probably avoiding it\nbecause she\u2019s worried that it might be\nawkward, or even that she might be\nrejected. Unfortunately, you just have\nto be really blunt, and just bring it\nup. If you\u2019re as into each other as you\nthink you are, hopefully it won\u2019t be a\nvery long conversation!\nHelp, I\u2019m dating an American girl and\nI\u2019m worried about her reaction when\nshe sees my uncircumcised penis. I\u2019m\ntoo shy to mention it to her, but I don\u2019t\nwant her to be surprised when she\ndiscovers it. Should I mention it to her\nin advance?\nUncut in Uxbridge\nIf she wants your D, she\u2019s not gonna\ncare about its shape or form. If you\u2019re\nreally worried about it, try and bring\nit up humorously in advance, so she\u2019s\nnot shocked. Americans often have\na belief that it\u2019s far less clean to be\nuncircumcised, but if you explain to\nher and reassure her that either way\ncan be just as hygienic, that should\nalleviate any nerves that she has. Plus\nyou should always remember, pigs in\nblankets is the best way to eat meat,\never.\nHelp! I\u2019m in the second year of my PhD,\nand I\u2019m at a point where I really hate\nwaking up in the morning because I\nknow I have to come into college and\nwork on it. I never get any productive\nwork done, and I\u2019m depressed all the\ntime outside college. I hate my PhD,\nbut I don\u2019t want to quit this far in.\nWhat can I do?\nDespondent in Dagenham\nThis is a really common problem for\nsecond year PhD students. During\nsuch a long project, it\u2019s really easy\nto lose track of why you\u2019re doing it.\nIt\u2019s best to take time to reassess your\nreasons for doing a PhD, and why\nyou chose that project in the first\nplace. Spend time with your friends,\ntake a break from the monotony,\nand hopefully after a while you\u2019ll be\nrefreshed and ready to get back into it.\nIf you\u2019re really struggling after taking\nsome time out, talk to your supervisor\nabout it; they might be able to make\nsuggestions on how to change the\nstructure of your project to help you\nback into it.\nHelp! My friends used to be really\nsociable and fun, but now we\u2019ve hit\nthird year, no-one ever wants to go out\nanymore. I understand that we\u2019ve got\na lot of work to do, but I need to take\na break and do something fun to de-stress a little bit! How can I convince\nthem to break the cycle of spending\nevery night at home?\nBored in Brockley\nI don\u2019t understand why you need your\nfriends to come out with you. Let\nyour buddies stew in their lab report\nand head down to the union bar.\nChances are you are likely to bump\ninto someone you know, or at least\nfind a group drunk enough to accept\nyou into their ranks. So stop trying to\nchange other people and expecting\nyour friends to hang out with you.\nThough of course, once they see you\ngoing out, they might want to join in\nthe fun and come with you anyway!\n1. You broke up for a reason\nAt some point, you broke up. At that point, whether it was\nin the heat of the moment, or a slow, considered decision,\nyou realised that you would be better off apart. Now\nyou\u2019ve been broken up for a while, you\u2019re lonely and you\nmiss them, and you want to get back together. This doesn\u2019t\nremove the validity of the decision, and being broken up\nfor a while won\u2019t fix the problems that you were having\nbefore. You decided that these problems were more than\nyou could bear, you\u2019ll only be making yourself miserable if\nyou go back on that decision now.\n2. Do you want to be that person?\nIf you get back together, everyone will assume that\nyou\u2019ve begged and grovelled until your ex would take you\nback (regardless of who broke up with whom, or what\nhappened). This is degrading and humiliating, and really\nnot something that you want. You might think that you\u2019re\nwilling to deal with that now, but when you look back,\nyou\u2019ll regret it.\n3. Why not try someone else?\nThere are seven billion people in the world, why are you\nsettling for just one, and one that at some point you decided\nwasn\u2019t good enough? Romantically speaking, if they\u2019ve\nbroken your heart, they\u2019re not The One, and you should\nmove on until you find them. Or if you\u2019re more scientific,\nstatistically speaking, there\u2019s bound to be someone better,\nwho\u2019s not shit.

Meanwhile, leading on from\nthe previous film, Bilbo has managed\nto acquire the mystical ring that is the\nsource of all the problems to come\nand he begins to feel its corrupting\ninfluence.\nThe Hobbit: The Desolation of\nSmaug: 25th February (Tuesday) and\n27th February (Thursday) at 19:00\nBecome a member for cheaper\ntickets for the rest of the year: www.\nimperialcinema.co.uk\nImperial Cinema\nThe Lego Movie\nDirector: Phil Lord, Christopher\nMiller\nWriter: Dan Hageman, Kevin\nHageman, Phil Lord, Christopher\nMiller\nStarring: (voices) Will Arnett,\nElizabeth Banks, Will Ferrell,\nWill Forte, Dave Franco, Morgan\nFreeman, Jonah Hill, Liam Neeson,\nChris Pratt, Cobie Summers,\nChanning Tatum\nRuntime: 100 minutes\nCertification: U\nEllen Mathieson\nWriter\nTwo of my favourite things in the\nentire world are Lego and films. It is\nprobably for this reason that the idea\nof a Lego movie had me worried.\nLearning that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller - the creative geniuses behind Cloudy with a Chance of\nMeatballs and 21 Jump Street - were\nmaking it, went some way to reassure\nme, but going into the cinema I still\nhad no idea what to expect. And what\nI got was so much better than anything I could have hoped for.\nThe film opens in a Lego volcano\nfilled with Lego lava and Lego rocks\n(sensing a theme here?) where President Business (Will Ferrell) is stealing\nthe Kragle from Vitruvius (Morgan\nFreeman). With this strange object,\nPresident Business has the ability to\ndestroy the universe. But it\u2019s okay, because there is a totally-true-because-it-rhymes prophesy about the existence of the most important person\never, the \u201cSpecial One with face of yellow\u201d who is destined to save the world.\nNow we meet a construction worker\ncalled Emmet (Chris Pratt) who, like\neveryone else, spends his entire life\nfollowing the instructions written by\nPresident Business. His life suddenly\nchanges when he accidently runs into\nthe beautiful Wyldstyle (she\u2019s got a\nboyfriend though, and it\u2019s super seri-ous) and discovers a mysterious brick\nknown as the Piece of Resistance.\nWith this in hand, Emmet must team\nup with an eclectic group of Master\nBuilders including Princess Unikitty,\nMetalbeard, Benny the astronaut and\nBatman to save the day. But to do this\nthey will have to infiltrate President\nBusiness\u2019 tower, a building with every\nkind of protection imaginable. Sharks.\nLasers. Sharks with lasers. Will our\nteam of heroes be able to stop the\nvillain in time? I guess you\u2019ll have to\nwatch to find out.\nNot only is the story both entertaining and engaging, the animation\nstyle is utterly gorgeous. Everything is\nmade out of Lego. And I mean every-thing. The buildings, the cars, the wa-ter, the food and of course the people.\nThe directors also manage to bring\ntogether a broad range of characters\nfrom a ridiculous number of franchises and weave them into a cohesive\nwhole. How many other films will get\nto watch that include conversations\nbetween Gandalf and Dumbledore,\nor C3P0 and Batman? Somehow these\nbit parts manage to never feel forced\nor unnecessary, injecting humour into\nthe script without bogging it down\nwith too many people. For those of\nyou who collect the Lego minifigures,\nbe on the lookout for your favourites\nas many of them have cameos if not\nspeaking roles.\nOverall, I cannot begin to express\nhow much I loved this film. It was silly\nand colourful and touching all at the\nsame time. Even if cartoon films aren\u2019t\nusually the sort of thing you go for because you are much too grown up for\n\u2018kids\u2019 films\u2019, I implore you try this one.\nIt isn\u2019t a kids film. It\u2019s a film for every-one, and everyone should see it. Why?\nTo quote the theme song: \u201ceverything\nis awesome!\u201d\n\n"

However before I could even\nsay \u201cstay low\u201d I heard yet another\nvoice shouting something.\n\u201cHey man, I\u2019m heading over to\ncherno. I don\u2019t have any food or\nanything can you help me out?\u201d a\nvery Scottish accent said.\nFrom my obviously useless cover I\neyed this guy up. He sounded sane\nenough, and didn\u2019t look that crazy\neither. Maybe my I had finally found\na friend! Wearily I stepped out.\n\u201cSure I have some food, what do you\nhave to offer me for it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can always offer you your\nlife.\u201d\nHe said it so incredibly calmly and\neerily that it sent chills down my\nspine. Before he could react, I ran\nat him and hit him in the head with\nmy axe. He immediately dropped.\nI whacked him in the head again,\njust to make sure he was really\ndead. I had now killed someone. I\nturned and left, not even looting the\nmangled corpse that lay bleeding\nbehind me. However on second\nI decided I would hide and see if\nanything interesting happened. I\nfound myself a better bush than\nlast time, and waited it out. Twenty\nminutes later, another man ran\ntowards the body. He looked at the\ncorpse, then turned to the sky.\n\u201cI will find you, you bitch!!!\u201d\n, he\nscreamed.\nVery worried he had seen me I\ncrouched down low. Soon however\nit became apparent that he had\njust vented his anger. As I saw him\nlooking for me from my hiding spot,\nI smiled and thought: Can\u2019t wait till\nyou do.\nDayZ Stories\nThe DayZ standalone has been\nreleased, and given the amazing\nstories that occur in that game, I\ndecided to make a kind of series\nout it! So here it goes:\nEpisode 2.2:\nAnna\u2019s Friend\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames Editor\nGaming in the Future\nWhat are things that may affect future gamers?\nVirtual Reality\nIn-game purchases\nMobiles\nDLC\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames Editor\nGaming is something I hold very\ndearly. I will defend my love with\ntooth and nail. Furthermore I like the\nstatus quo. I like the way I buy, play\nand interact with games, and in fact\nI could say that I am actually missing\nthe past a bit. However I can see\nthat gaming is changing, and maybe\nnot always for the best. So here I list\nthe 4 main things that will influence\ngaming in the foreseeable future:\nThere are the good type of DLCs and\nthe bad type of DLCs. I shall focus on\nthe bad type: the one that forces you\nto pay if you want to have a complete\ngame. The picture below says it\nall. Back in the day, when I bought\nmy first Rome total war (yes again\nwith that game), I remember that\nthe expansion packs actually added\nentirely new content. No with the\nsecond Rome, the DLC just unlock\nfactions that are already available\nin the game. This trend of needing\nto monetize a game by forcing users\nto pay at several different instances,\njust to extend the lifetime of a game,\nis infuriating. I mean, I am not going\nto buy a car and then need to pay\nan extra \u00a3100 to be able to use the\nradio. This type of business model is\nfound nowhere else in the world, and\njustifiably so. However with the profit\nmargins of Game makers shrinking\nand shrinking, they will persist with\nthis model. So expect more and more\nDLC heavy/episodic type games.\nThis is the one item on this list that\nmakes me feel quite a bit trepidation\nabout what the future of gaming\nmay become. I hate hate hate in\ngame purchases. They just seem a\ncheap gimmick for me where the\ngame creator is trying to rip us off,\nespecially if I paid a significant amount\nof money for said game. I mean, I\nunderstand the concept: some people\nhave time but no money and some\npeople have money and time. Both\nare currencies that can be traded for\nin items. However when the items you\nneed to progress are only available\nthrough monetary means this is when\nI get annoyed. Sadly this method of\nmaking money seems to be working,\nand won\u2019t disappear. I really just hope\nthat game makers still keep in mind\nwho really plays their games, cues to\nget copies and raves to others about it.\nThis has been the dream of every gamer\nsince birth. How epic would it be to\nactually run through a game, see what\nyour character sees through their eyes,\nand just be so immersed in your game\nthat you could swear it was reality.\nThe imminent release of the Oculus\nRift has turned those dreams into\nsomething of a hope that viable virtual\nreality will happen in our generation.\nThis Kickstarter funded device, which\nis pretty much a \u2018mask\u2019 over your face,\nwhich projects two slightly different\nimages for each eye. This creates the\nillusion that you are actually viewing the\nworld from the perspective of the game.\nSo the visual aspect is now sorted. What\nis with movement and touch? Well\nKickstarter comes to the rescue again!\nThe Virtuix Omni, which is pretty much\na glorified treadmill. However it is also\nso much more than that. It records your\nmovement, so when you step in reality,\nyour in-game character will copy that.\nThese two things combined seem to\nsignal the advent of virtual reality. More\nthan anything, this is what gamers\nare demanding from the future. Also,\nthen exercising will be made so much\ninteresting and exciting. I mean taking a\nrun around Skyrim, exploring the caves\nandmountainsofthisfantasyworldbeat\nLondon, surrounded by cars and grey\nrain,everysingledayoftheyear.Thetwo\nbig hurdles are, firstly how much will\nthe big gaming companies invest in this\nuntested and potentially very expensive\ntechnology. Without the support of the\ngame studios, no one will ever want any\nvirtual reality gadget if they can\u2019t play\nanything on it. Secondly, how much will\nthese devices cost the average gamer?\nIf they are priced out of ever owning\none, then they will be doomed to fail.\nNo, this is not about mobile gaming.\nThat is a topic that deserves gaming\narticle all for its own. Here we are\ngoing to look at the implications\nof what it means for hard-core\ngaming if you have the addition of\na second screen. The case study I\nwill present the case of Battlefield\n4 (Yes, that game again as well).\nThe addition of a tablet in the game\nprocess as a general type character\nis very interesting and adds an\nentire dimension to the gameplay.\nHowever very few other games\nhave implemented such a feature.\nWhy not? It is quite enjoyable to\nbe able to just play with your mates\nwithout having to actually to always\ninteract directly. This method\nof introducing different ways of\nplaying the same game not only\nextends the lifetime of the game\nitself as well as encouraging new\nplayers to try it out. Furthermore\nas mobile computing becomes\nmore and more powerful, it seems\nthat the logical conclusion will be\nmajor games will migrate to solely\noccupy this medium. However is\nit really? The way we interact with\ngames e.g. with keyboard/mouse\nor controller. Even though you are\ndistinct from the game, the level\nof immersion is still limited. Is\nthis possible if you are going to be\ntouching the screen all the time?\nEvery time you bring that finger\nbetween yourself and the game, you\nare reminded that you aren\u2019t in the\ngame. For now, and the foreseeable\nfuture I think that laptops/desktops\nand consoles will dominate\nthe hard-core gaming market.\n\n"

We have the power to\nsuppress disease, pacify hunger, come\nand go as we so choose. Things have\ngrown, unfurled like ivy tendrils that are\ninfinitely rich and thick. Buildings tower\nlike divine beacons. Men (regrettably)\nhave the power to take a life at the touch\nof a button. Information flows like a\ncascading fluid. Men try to stop its flow,\nto cork the bottle of knowledge...but the\nseal leaks, the fluid still flows and men\nand women slake their thirst.\nMen leave the fields, pace the cobbles\nof glimmering cities in the night.\nThey search for life, advancement and\nhope. Parliaments continue to tick\nlike well-oiled clocks in homage to the\nConstantinople, Rome and Athens of\nthe past. Theatres fill with budding\nenthusiasts, challenging notions of\nculture, civility and a higher state of\nawareness. Restaurants feed labourers\nafter a hard day\u2019s work, numb the pains\nand fill the stomachs of berated men\nand women. Police cars roam and race\nthrough the labyrinth of streets like\nguardians, sentinels of order, scuttling\nbeetles in a transient hive. Universities\npulsate with knowlegde, lighting the\nway for future generations.\nThings move ever so swiftly forward\nand yet nothing ever changes. We come\nfull circle...and when we realise this the\ncentre may or may not hold.\nMaybe time is one discreet event.\nI see it as a mirror. Perhaps God set\nus a challenge, taking the mirror and\ndropping it from a height. Perhaps this\nis why we continue to strive and to seek.\nEach civilisation that comes and goes\nexamines the fragments, piece by piece,\nin an attempt to resolve the pearlescent,\nglimmering puzzle. We seem to get so\nfar. We fail, slice a finger, lacerate a vein,\nlet some blood, nurse our wounds...we\nhave to start all over again.\nWe don\u2019t want to finish the restoration\nof this universal mirror. What would\ncome after? After all, there is more fun\nin seeing infinitely many reflections and\nmysteries in the jagged fragments. If we\nwere to fix it and seal every fragment\nback in place, we would see but one\nreflection. We might not like it.\nIt\u2019s above my head. The glint of those\nfragments sears my eyes. One day, like\na hermit in the sun, I sought solace. I\nsought shade. It was to be found in a\ncafe. Standing squat and square with\nfour walls, penned in by victorian\nbrick from above and below, it became\nmy bunker. A glass veranda served to\nmaintain a link between worlds. Cars\nwould dance to and fro as their hums\nand roars blended with the clamour\nof cups and plates glancing dark wood\ntabletops.\nThe place appealed to me through its\nsimplicity. My memories receded from\nmemory when I stepped through the\ndoor. Young men served with a greeting,\na smile, a handshake or pat on the back,\nproviding a lift. I gave due attention\nto the pure. The light music numbed\nthe senses and caused the strain in my\ntemples, teeth and neck to relax like a\nslackening sail. Every motion on the\nclock face seemed worthwhile, nothing\nwasted.\nI would dive deep into intricate novel\nplots, surfacing late at night. The place\nallowed me to focus my interests into\nmental diamonds, concrete my passions\ninto discrete kernels of knowledge.\nThings seemed possible. The tea\nand coffee, above all, captured the\nimagination. Dark and steaming cups of\npure white porcelain dotted the tables.\nPeople paused, flared their nostrils and\nraised the warmth to their lips. Some\nwould even close their eyes, at ease.\nOne can see why ancient cultures\nrevered the act of tea drinking as a\nceremony, a rite of passage. It is an\nsimple act but steeped in symbolism.\nBy stopping, pausing and drinking all\nother things seemed to stem from that\nmoment. Groups gathered to play chess.\nLong lost friends held one another\u2019s\ngaze across tables, the gulf between\nthem peppered with the fragrant steam\nof hot drinks. Men and women donned\ntheir finest clothes; jumpers of wool,\nscarves of silk, well-made shoe-soles\nslapped the marble floors.\nDespite the calm there was still room\nfor obscurity. In the cafe, as beyond\nits doors, one still felt lost at times,\noverwhelmed...but at least there was a\nplatform, sure footing to stand on. It\nwas my breastplate, my armour, a shield\nfrom relentless missiles of reality.\nOne night I withdrew my philosophy\nnotes from my bag. I calmly read over\npages of Adorno and Horkheimer, the\nedges furled and crippled.\n\u201ccharacterise enlightenment as...\nliberation from fear of the unknown...by\nacquisition of genuine knowledge.\u201d\nIn that instant the cafe assumed a\nvoice. Chairs scraped the floor, old men\nbellowed and children giggled and all\nthe while white china clicked, sang in\nharmony, reverberating off mellowed\nwalls. It spoke to me.\nLet go. Become a free and spontaneous\nbeing. Pause. Breathe the air. Don\u2019t fix\nthe broken mirror. Stop seeking more.\nPocket instead a fragment of glass, plane\nits edges, distill it of all its coarseness\nand carry it with you until the end of\nyour days.\nI turned back to my coffee, took a\nsip and smiled. In my mind I saw some\nancient monk of another time and place.\nWith one skilled, steady hand he painted\na fay, fine tree in full blossom on faded\nparchment: It had but a few branches.\nThe monk stopped, placed his brush on\nthe ground.\nHe turned to his steaming tea and\ndrank.\nTea & Coffee Truths\nA short story by Eoghan Totten\nSend your submissions for\nour newest regular fea-tures!\nFLASH FICTION: Ultrashort\nfiction up to 200 characters\nSTUDENT PICKS: Send us up\nto 250 words on your favourite book and how it changed\nyou\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nStudent Picks\nMadame Bovary is generally considered to be one of the\nbest novels ever written. This is already an excellent reason to read it, but I\u2019ll recommend it anyway.\nI am reading it for the third time. Still it morphs into different shapes, carrying with it all the subtlety of Flaubert\u2019s\ncharacters. The first time I read it, very young (too young\nperhaps), I was overcome with feeling for the tragedy of\nEmma Bovary\u2019s situation. A beautiful, sensual woman\nwith too much imagination, alone in grey, boring country villages with only the bore-of-a-husband for company.\nNo wonder she takes to romanticism; no wonder she finds\nherself a couple of lovers; no wonder she commits suicide\nwhen everything collapses!\nThen I read it again. What mastery Flaubert has over his\nhideous world, the world of the stupid petite bourgeoisie!\nEmma Bovary, I realised, was tragic in herself, through her\nown shallowness, because of her inability to really look\nat the world. She lives in a world of dreams, unoriginal\ndreams, the clich\u00e9d dreams of Romanticism. Nothing she\nexperiences in life can compare! Flaubert manages to create a rich character, full of life, alive as it were, whilst holding her in utter contempt. I found this fascinating.\nThis time, I\u2019m struck by what I perceive as an extreme\nsympathy for the character. Flaubert is criticising, with\nirony, with half-veiled insults, but also with a wry com-passion.\nIt has changed for me yet again. There are so many truths\nabout life, about oneself and society, to be found in Madame Bovary... in so short a text, I can really only say: read\nit. The rest is filler.\nMadame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert\nEva Rosenthal picks:\n\n"

    "content": "32 FRIDAY 21 FEB\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBenefits Britain and the ethics of TV-making\nA\ns a self-confessed fan\nof Benefits Street, I\nwas confused at the\nbreak in the series two\nweeks back, which was\nfollowed by an announcement that\nChannel 4 was capitalising further on\nthe few weeks of column inches the\nshow had earned them by staging a\ndebate on benefits.\nIt promised to feature the not very\nguilty looking programme makers,\njournalists with middle class axes\nto grind and politicians with pre-prepared sound bites of their own. It\nwas being recorded a whole month\nafter Newsnight had quizzed a doe-eyed producer, LBC had got resident\n\u2018White Dee\u2019 to participate in a call-in\nwith an unprepared Nick Clegg, and\neveryone else and their uncle had\nstopped talking about it. Presumably\nthis was because the possibility of a\nsecond series has been quashed by the\nfact that the show\u2019s biggest characters\nnow get \u201cbetween 50 and 100 knocks\non the door a day\u201d and the guy trying\nto sell cups of detergent for 50p door to\ndoor only gets asked for photographs\nnowadays.\nThe show was preceded by a half\nan hour long Benefits Street: The Last\nWord, a lazy but vaguely interesting\nrefresher showing some of the\ncharacters\u2019 best bits as well as a chance\nto see their new post-fame haircuts.\nThroughout this week, awkward\nadverts featuring James Turner\nStreet residents invited us to share\nour thoughts using #BenefitsBritain,\nreminding us that a debate was\non the horizon. It began, quite\nuncomfortably, straight off the back of\nthe last instalment of the docu-soap.\nRichard Bacon looked excited; he\nhad a post-watershed hour and a\nstudio audience rife with opinion.\nHe wasn\u2019t a Blue Peter presenter\nanymore, he was Matthew Wright,\nJeremy Kyle and Paxman combined.\nHe pre-emptively warned us of fruity\nlanguage and rowdy debate. There\nwere cross-armed, unimpressed\nlooking James Turner Street residents\nin one corner, who seemed happy to\nbe represented by White Dee (who\nwent as just Dee this evening, as the\nother one hadn\u2019t made an appearance)\nsitting across the room from the very\njournalists who had condemned them.\nAt this point, the show had promise.\nThings began tempestuously with\njournalist Allison Pearson (under\npressure from a hysterical Bacon)\nbeing forced to repeat the ridiculous\nimplication of her article: that Dee\njust seemed too cheerful onscreen to\nhave depression. This coupled with\na mention of her horrendous \u2018Mick\nPhilpott, a good reason to cut benefits\u2019\npiece for The Daily Telegraph seemed\nall too much, and wily tweeters noticed\nthat 45 minutes in she had disappeared\nfrom the front row. Maybe she had\nsomewhere to be. You get the sense\nthat Katy Hopkins wouldn\u2019t have been\nso shy and (literally) retiring.\nTo Pearson\u2019s credit, she had\nquestioned the usual lack of female\npanellists. On an initial glance, the\nleft was better represented, with the\nTories having to resort to their secret\nweapon, a rare state-educated MP:\nex-fireman Mike Penning. The show\nreally fell down with Bacon though,\nwho took 45 minutes to warm up\nto the idea of controlling such a\npassionate panel. There was heckling\nfrom the back, incoherent rants\nfrom the self-made CEOs of The Big\nIssue and Pimlico Plumbers (whose\nmullet was more distracting than the\nF-bomb he dropped) and a lot of it\nmade for quite uncomfortable viewing\n(in true middle class fashion I often\nhad to mute the TV and rely on Zoe\nWilliams\u2019 live blogging of the event for\nThe Guardian).\nBut, unsurprisingly, the debate didn\u2019t\nfocus on the most interesting point,\nand the one that anyone had any real\nchance of getting to the heart of in an\nhour: whether or not the production\ncompany had acted responsibly in its\ntreatment and portrayal of residents\nof James Turner Street, and how aware\nthey were of the furore the program\nwould create. Understandably, to\nmake a representative series they had\nto shoot for 18 months or so, but as\nBenefits Street\u2019s detractors and some\nappearing on the debate pointed out, a\nlot of positive footage seemed to have\nbeen left out. None of the recurring\nfaces were in work, and between\nthem had admitted to armed robbery,\nGrace Rahman asks whether a live debate was necessary\nStar Cops: A sci-fi golden oldie\nMaciej Matuszewski\nContributor\nF\nirst let me say \u2013 no, it\u2019s not as\nbad as its name suggests. In\nfact it\u2019s nothing like its name\nsuggest. The show itself jokes\nabout how bad a name it is\nin its very first episode. Star Cops is\nnot some cheap police action-drama\ncarelessly transplanted into a space\nsetting. Instead, it is a very intelligent,\nbrilliantly written piece of television,\nand one of the most unique examples\nof the SF genre that has ever graced\nour screens.\nThe action takes place in the near\nfuture of 2027, when space travel\nhas become almost commonplace\nand humanity has constructed\nseveral orbital space stations, as\nwell permanent bases on the Moon\nand Mars. However, the spread of\nhumanity through the solar system\nhas brought with it the spread of\ncrime, necessitating the formation of\nthe International Space Police Force\n(ISPF). Star Cops follows the inaugural\ncommander of this organisation,\nNathan Spring, and his staff as they\ndeal with the problems of building\nthe ISPF from an underfunded semiprofessional group into a credible\npolice force.\nThe real strength of the show is its\nwriting. Series creator Chris Boucher\nhad a great deal of experience of\nworking on both science fiction\nand crime dramas, including the\npopular Blake\u2019s 7 and Bergerac, and\nboth his experience and innate skill\nshow through in every episode. The\nshow\u2019s plots are all interesting and\nwell-thought out, cleverly exploring\nboth the new forms that crime might\ntake in outer space as well as the\ninternational tensions that might arise\nfrom different nations competing in\nspace. The political intrigue is one\nof the highlights of the show \u2013 with\nSpring having to play diplomat as\nmuch as detective and pretty much\nevery superpower being shown as\nbeing brutally ruthless in what it is\nprepared to do to achieve its goals. Star\nCops is special in being one of the few\ntelevision shows out there to even flirt\nwith the idea of hard science fiction \u2013\ntrying to keep the science as plausible\nas possible and carefully considering\nthe potential consequences of\ntechnological advancement.\nThe show\u2019s characters are also very\nwell realised. No one is presented in\nterms of absolutes \u2013 everyone has a\nrich and complex personality and most\nhaverigorouslydevelopedback-stories\n\u2013 in short, they seem like real people.\nThis is greatly helped by the well-written, intelligent dialogue and some\nvery good performances, particularly\nfrom David Calder, portraying Nathan\nSpring. Spring in particular is a very\ninteresting character \u2013 intelligent yet\noften brusque and socially awkward \u2013\na temperament explained by his tragic\nback-story. Much of the show focuses\non his often turbulent relationship\nwith his staff, not helped by their\nmany personal and professional\nshortcomings, and with him trying to\nget over his past.\nThe show was produced in the late\n1980s and, while the special effects do\nlooksomewhatdated,theyretainmuch\nof their effectiveness. It is immediately\nvisible that a lot of time and effort was\nput in the creative team to make the\nshow look as good as possible. The\nmodel work is both imaginative and\nrealistic and special mention must be\ngiven to the ambitious weightlessness\nspecial effects \u2013 achieved through\nwire work and trick camera angles.\nThis is especially impressive given\nthat even most modern science fiction\nshows tend not to bother with this,\npreferring instead the cheap cop out\nof \u2018artificial gravity\u2019.\nStar Cops was an excellent show and\nfar ahead of its time. Always enjoyable,\nand often powerful, viewing \u2013 it was a\ncrime that it was cancelled after only\nnine episodes.

    "content": "4 FRIDAY 21 FEB\nFEATURES\nEditor: Shiladitya\nGhosh\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nN\next week is Student\nVolunteering Week\n(SVW), a nationwide\ncelebration of the\npower of student\nvolunteering. Imperial College\nLondon is one of many universities\ncelebrating SVW, with activities\ncoordinated by students from Imperial\nHub\u2019s Local Action Committee in\ncollaboration with the Union. We\u2019re\naiming to showcase the diverse\npositive impact that we can make in\nour local communities, inspire new\nor further engagement with social\nissues, and highlight how easy it is to\nget involved as a student. The week\nis organised by students for students,\nand whether you volunteer weekly,\nin the holidays, or not at all, there\u2019s\nsomething for everyone.\nFor students on Imperial Hub\u2019s Local\nAction Committee, it\u2019s exciting that\nthe week has finally arrived. Planning\nfor SVW began back in November\nwith weekly meetings to decide the\naims and put together a programme\nof events to engage a wide range of\ntheir fellow students. They were also\ncommitted to showcasing the efforts\nof current student volunteers and\nhave partnered with a number of\nstudent groups to raise awareness of\ntheir opportunities throughout the\nweek. You might not realise that there\nare nearly 3,500 Imperial students\nwho volunteer through the Union\nor Imperial Hub. From delivering\nthe Union\u2019s services and activities to\ntackling social and environmental\nissues, these students demonstrate\na commitment to going above and\nbeyond for others.\nIn preparation for the week, the\nSVW team interviewed Imperial\nstudents who volunteer in a range\nof different projects. Sijia Yu, a first\nyear biologist, is involved in Imperial\nHub\u2019s Schools Plus programme. She\nis one of 150 Imperial students who\nprovide 800+ hours of free tuition\neach term to disadvantaged pupils\nin local schools and community\norganisations. She described her\nexperience: \u201cI volunteer in the First\nGeorgian supplementary school as a\nScience and Maths tutor. Nearly all\nthe students have Georgian bloodline,\nmost of them cannot speak English\nvery well and can\u2019t understand some\nscientific terms due to the language\nbarrier. I try to use simple words or\nsynonyms to explain a concept when\nthey feel confused, and I have found\ngraphs and videos to be very useful.\nTwo months ago, the school set up\nwifi, so we are now able to show\nstudents the relevant images when\nthey have no idea what a word means.\nIn addition, sometimes I use Russian\nto assist tuition because most students\nthere speak Russian; it is unusual, but\nit does work! Nevertheless, all of the\nvolunteers are always trying their very\nbest to help these students.\u201d\nThere is no doubt that the\nvolunteers make a positive impact\non the pupils they tutor. A teacher in\nNorth Kensington told us, \u201cOur pupils\nenjoy working with Imperial students\nbecause they are passionate about\ntheir subjects. Having young tutors\nmeans that pupils can relate to them\nand we really appreciate their time\nand efforts.\u201d\nAnother student that was\ninterviewed, William Brown, a\nChemical Engineering undergrad\nand chair of tutoring project TEAM\nStudents emphasised the skills\nyou can gain from volunteering.\n\u201cVolunteers learn at least as much\nas their pupils. Our volunteers come\nfrom many different backgrounds\nand all have different reasons for\njoining, but a common theme is\nthe strong desire to help those less\nfortunate and our project as a whole\nis a very powerful manifestation of\nthis desire. Tuition teaches patience,\nprofessionalism, flexibility and\ntime management skills \u2013 all very\nimportant for a student\u2019s personal\ndevelopment.\u201d\nMatthew Proctor, a second year\nphysicist who volunteers at the\nImperial College Cooperative\nstall on Thursdays in Sherfield,\nshared similar views. \u201cI think\nstudent volunteering is an excellent\nopportunity to meet new friends and\ndevelop your skills. It gives me the\nchance to work with a brilliant group\nof intelligent, interesting, and funny\nstudents who are very passionate\nabout their work. It\u2019s also fun. With\nsuch a tough degree that sometimes\ngets overwhelming, working on the\nstall is something I look forward\nto every week and it\u2019s just such an\nenriching experience that I\u2019d highly\nrecommend to anyone thinking\nabout volunteering.\u201d\nOff campus, the student group\nSoup Run provides food, drink and\ncompany to local homeless and\nvulnerable people. Heather Jeffery,\nSoup Run Coordinator, explained,\n\u201cThe Soup Run gives Imperial students\nthe opportunity to do something\ncompletely different to their studies.\nVolunteering in the community is\npersonally rewarding and it makes a\ndifference to the lives of those in need.\u201d\nMaddy Maxwell, a second year\nMedic who is coordinating SVW\nthrough Imperial Hub, said: \u201cWe\nbelieve that the number of Imperial\nstudent volunteers and the impact\nthat they make is underestimated, so\nwe\u2019re looking forward to using SVW\nto showcase the diverse positive\nimpact that we can make in our local\ncommunities, inspire new or further\nengagement with social issues, and\nhighlight how easy it is to get involved\nas a student both during the week and\nbeyond.\u201d\nInteracting with your local\ncommunity outside of the lecture\ntheatre, laboratory or library can be\nhugely valuable and SVW is all about\ngiving every Imperial student a chance\nto try something new. As well as on-campus events, you can get involved\nin our local boroughs of Kensington\nand Chelsea and Hammersmith and\nFulham, as well as in Westminster,\nCamden, Hillingdon, Islington, Tower\nHamlets, Southwark and Lambeth.\nBeyond SVW\nThe good news is that the fun\ndoesn\u2019t stop when the week finishes.\nYou can continue to make the most\nof your time at Imperial and get to\nknow the community you study and\nlive in. By volunteering, you can make\na difference to an issue you care about\nor ignite a passion you didn\u2019t know you\nhad; it will provide you with a wealth\nof skills outside of your academic\nlife and is a great way to boost your\nemployability. It\u2019s flexible, hugely\nrewarding and gives you the chance\nto experience a new industry or sector\n\u2013 you can even gain an accreditation\nfor your efforts through the Union\u2019s\nImperial Plus scheme or Imperial\nHub\u2019s Social Leadership Award.\n24th Feb - 2nd Mar\nStudent Volunteering Week\nJoin students from across London on\na run (options from 2-14km) to a community\norganisation that needs your help.\n* Free lollipops\nChallenge a friend to a game of\nlawn darts for your chance to win\ngood deeds and SVW prizes\nSign up to the organ\ndonor registry\nMeet current volunteers, take\npart in interactive activities, grab a\nlollipop and sign up to events\nSpend an afternoon selling\nfairtrade & organic produce to\nstudents with Imperial Cooperative\nA range of skills based training\nworkshops will run through the week.\n*You must be registered for Imperial Plus\nJoin our team of student\nshopkeepers and spend an\nafternoon helping at some charity\nshops in Hammersmith\nBecome an Urban Nature\nchampion at an Islington\ncommunity garden with London\n* Spare a moment to share a\nproblem - or provide a solution!\n12-2pm\nMonday\nQueen\u2019s\nLawn\nGood Deed Day\nTarget Toss\nSVW stall Get a skills boost\nwith Imperial Plus\nGet fit & make a\ndifference with Good Gym\nSpruce up a\ncommunity garden\nCharity shop takeover\n* Questionnaire\nongoing\nEnjoy a fun and active afternoon\nvolunteering at a nature reserve\nGet out of the city &\nback to nature\nJoin in with a zumba session\nfollowed by tea and cake at a\nlocal community centre\nEntertain the Elderly 2-4pm\nTuesday\nKensington\nOlympia\nSpend a morning gardening\nat one of Britain\u2019s oldest and\nmost distinguished cemeteries.\nHang out with history\nimperialhub.org/svw\nAlso...\n1:30-5pm\nWednesday\nIslington\n10am-1pm\nMonday\nLSE\nIt takes less than a minute, and\nyou could help to save a life!\nwww.tinyurl.com/thankyouforlife\nLooking for an excuse to do something good?\nSign up online at imperialhub.org/svw\nHelp feed the homeless\nA rewarding way to end the week.\nJoin Soup Run volunteers to collect\nfood & distribute it to homeless people.\n* Look out for the turquoise\nballoons!\nFood glorious food\nBe a coding champion\nKnow how to code?

If you found yourself saying yes to\none or more of the aforementioned, then carry on reading!\nI\nDo you ever wonder why we\nare here? Does it make sense\nthat everything around us has\na purposeful order to it and we\nare the anomalies? Will our lives\never matter in the grand scheme of\nthings, or are we just material beings,\nthat can feel pleasure because of\nchemicals in the brain? \u2018Who\u2019 is it that\nactually feels?\nIf these questions resonate with\nyou, then it will be worth finding out\nthe answers Islam gives. Discover\nIslam week will be taking place from\nthe 24th-28th February. This week\nis your chance to find out about the\nfundamental questions pertaining\nto our existence, clear up any\nmisconceptions, and indulge in lots of\nexotic foods for free.\nThroughout the week there will be\nexhibitions in Sherfield and SAF on\nIslam and approachable volunteers\nat hand to discuss and clarify any\nquestions you have. Speakers from all\naround the world will be travelling to\nImperial to give exciting talks, which\nwill undoubtedly provide a platform\nfor a myriad of intellectual discussions.\nThe talks will kick off on Tuesday 29th\nwith \u2018The Pursuit of Happiness\u2019 and\non Thursday 27th the talk will discuss\n\u2018Is Life Just a Game?\u2019. The week will\nconclude on the Friday with an open\nQ&A \u2018Discover over Dinner\u2019 session,\nthere will be two renowned guest\nspeakers and of course, a free dinner\nwith a mix of Indian and Arab cuisine!\nAnd it gets better \u2013 you can share\nyour opinions and discuss these topics\nin length with a number of friendly\nvolunteers.\n\u201cAnd we did not create the heavens\nand the earth and that between them\nin play.\u201d Quran {44:38}\nIslam is simple. It is a religion\nwith over 1.6 billion followers (yes a\nstaggering 25% of the population is\nMuslim) and 5000 Brits convert to\nIslam every year. We are here for a\npurpose and life is a journey where\nyou fulfil that purpose. Our soul needs\nnourishment just the way our body\ndoes. Yet we spend our lives perfecting\nthis material body, chasing material\npossessions, and not recognising the\nspiritual side to our beings. Perfection\nis not just inward, but outward in\nour actions and deeds. Islam asks us\nto dedicate our lives to the service of\nhumanity, which in itself is an act of\nworship. Islam is a philosophy and\nreligion and offers moral, economic,\nsocial and judicial systems for the\nbetterment of the human condition.\nAnd Muhammad was not just a\nProphet, but was revolutionary, a\nstatesman, a negotiator, a military\ntactician, a spiritual guide, a husband,\na father, lover and most importantly\na human like you and me. Islam\nis a holistic way of life, not just a\nsuperficial doctrine.\nRegardless of your perceptions,\nthe only way to truly know for sure\nis to find out. We most humbly invite\nyou to take part in Discover Islam\nWeek; most assuredly, it will be a\nlife changing opportunity not to be\nmissed!\nJawaad Farooq\n\n"

Twenty year old\nNottingham resident Bradley Eames\nposted a video of himself downing\ntwo pints of gin to Facebook. He\ndied a few days, reportedly from\nalcohol poisoning, though police\nhave indicated that post-mortem\ntoxicology tests were inconclusive.\nNekNomination involves\nindividuals posting videos and\nimages of themselves drinking large\nquantities of alcohol to the internet\nand then nominating their friends\nto do the same. The game is claimed\nto have begun in Australia but has\nrecently found a lot of popularity in\nthe British Isles.\nIts critics maintain that it uses peer\npressure to force vulnerable people\nto perform dangerous stunts. Mr\nEames\u2019 death follows that of London\nhotel worker Isaac Richardson,\nCardiff resident Stephen Brooks and\nIrish citizens Jonny Byrne and Ross\nCummins. Byre, a teenager, is said to\nhave thrown himself into a river as\npart of his challenge.\nThe BBC reported that the creators\nof the NekNomination Facebook\npage have made efforts to counter\nthe dangerous effects of the game. In\na statement they said: \u201cWe made the\ndecision a few nights ago to no longer\ncontinue to run the page the way it was\noriginally set up. All videos have been\nremoved and we\u2019d like to continue as\na Neknomination awareness page,\nhighlighting the dangers surrounding\nthe game.\u201d The scandal has also\nprompted the creation of the \u2018Random\nActs of Kindness Nomination\u2019\nwebsite, which encourages people to\npost videos of themselves performing\nacts of charity.\nImmigration Bill has\nsecond reading in Lords\nNekNominations\n- a fifth reported\nfatality\nT\nhe second reading of the\nImmigration Bill took\nplace in the House of Lords\nlast Monday. The reading\nstretched over a seven-hour period during which the Peers\ndiscussed several aspects of the bill,\nincluding a lengthy discussion about\nthe prospective problems facing\noverseas students due to the bill.\nKey opponents to the bill included\nLord Patel and Lord Winston, both\nof whom are Professors that hold\nuniversity Chancellorships.\nDuringthedebateLordPatelpointed\nout that: \u201c\u2026international students in\nhigher education contributed \u00a310.2\nbillion to the UK economy. \u2026To give\nsome more detailed figures, as regards\nthe total entrants by subject from\nnon-EU countries, in STEM subjects\nthere was a drop in 2011-12 of 8% and\na further 2% in 2012-13. These are\nofficial figures\u201d.\nThe Peer also pointed out problems\nthat the introduction of the \u201chealth\nsurcharge\u201d would cause for the\neconomy, possibly dissuading skilled\nmigrant workers from traveling to the\nUK.\nMeanwhile Lord King of\nBridgewater countered the argument\nby suggesting that: \u201cit is no good for\nthe country to feel that there is no\nconcern about problems that are\ncoming up over illegal immigration\nand abuse of the immigration system.\nIt is our responsibility in Parliament\nto help command public confidence,\notherwise we will face a much more\nserious situation in the future\u201d.\nIn response, Lord Winston gave\nvocal evidence about his experience as\nan overseas post-doctoral researcher\nin Belgium and also spoke about how\nseveral of the students he had met\nwhile visiting top universities in the\nUSA were \u201cconvinced that we are not\nopen for business\u201d.\nAdditionally Baroness Barker\npointed out that not only had the\nLabour government carried out an\nconsultation into a similar plan to\n\u201cexclude visitors from free primary\ncare\u201d but also that the research carried\nout by the government to support the\nbill \u201cgave the impression that frontline staff in acute health services had\ncome up with systematic observations\nabout migrants and their use of the\nNHS. In fact, what it revealed was that\nthere was no systematic observation,\nand that quite often people were\nsimply asked questions on the basis of\ntheir appearance or nationality.\u201d\nMarissa Lewis, Union Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) observed the\nprogress of the debate over the course\nof the evening. Lewis authored the\nUnion\u2019s submission of evidence to\nthe Select Committee on Science and\nTechnology\u2019s inquiry into the effects\nthe immigration on international\nstudents, which was based on a paper\nbrought to Council last December.\nThe bill is scheduled to go through\nthe Lords Committee stage on March\n3, followed by a report stage and third\nreading before receiving Royal Assent.\nEditor-in-Chief\nJoe Letts\nHOUSES OF PARLIAMENT\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNews Editor\n\n"

Of the\nmodern age of technology, social\nmedia has perhaps had the most\nprofound effect on our lives, reaching\nout with its addictive grip to almost\neveryone with a smart device.

Well what all these things\nare raving about is: Twitch plays Pok\u00e9mon. Twitch is a site that allows for\nlive streaming, most notably for Dota 2 or League of Legends competitions.\nHowever some ingenious individual, who remains anonymous, has\ncreated a great social experiment by allowing the watchers of the channel\nto control the character in the Pok\u00e9mon game. They do this by typing the\nbutton into the chat, which is then relayed to the game.\nAt the time of writing Red, the protagonist of the game, was stuck at route\n12. Furthermore he has released several Pok\u00e9mon including his starter,\nCharmeleon. Oh and also, somehow this experiment has spawned the cult\nof the Helix, which seems to worship the Helix Fossil\u2026.\nAll in all, after 6 days of playing the community has not really achieved\nmuch, getting 4 badges, catching 12 Pok\u00e9mon and generally just walking\naround in circles.\nWhat this playthrough has shown is that humanity does not really work\nwell as a whole. Trolls and idiots alike seem to congregate and try to ruin\nthe game for others.

People used to believe\nthat with the invention of the mobile\nphone, human communication was\nat its finest, how wrong they were,\nbut who\u2019s to say that even now we\nare at our peak in terms of keeping in\ntouch with each other? Social media\nstill has a long road ahead, with its\nfuture promising, but there is still\na mostly unseen dark side of it that\nhas been seen creeping into society,\nfrom privacy breaches to cyber-bullying. We can expect to see a lot\nmore changes in social media, from\nnew platforms to more regulations\non internet communication or maybe\neven cross platform communication.\nAdvertising is a big part of social\nmedia, with most platforms making\ntheir profits from it. Big brands and\ncompanies have had to adapt to a\nnew \u2018phenomena\u2019 of advertising, no\nlonger being able to solely rely on\nthe old fashioned \u2018in your face\u2019 TV\nadvertising. Companies have to be\ntactful, they need to play the game\nright and come up with unexpected,\nimaginative ways to get the user\u2019s\nattention, or face having their ads\nswatted away into the abyss of news\nfeeds and selfies. One example of\nsuch innovation is that of Frijj\u2019s, a\nmilkshake brand, where they created a\ngame for one if its products, requiring\nplayers to watch funny YouTube\nvideos without laughing. Using facial\nrecognition technology, the game\nwas able to recognise when the player\nlaughed and give them a record of how\nlong they lasted and allow them to\nshare their times and challenge friends\non Twitter or Facebook. This kind of\noutlandish advertising paid off for\nFrijj, attracting around 140,000 people\nin the first few weeks, illustrating the\npower of advertising through a social\nmedium. The future of social media\nwill certainly in part be shaped by\nadvertising, as many platforms such\nas Facebook will adapt in the best way\nto deliver adverts to its users without\naffecting their experience.\nOf course nothing in this world is\nperfectandathingsuchassocialmedia\ncan never be flawless, despite having\nthe potential to do so much good. On\nthe surface, the downfalls of social\nwebsites include procrastination, with\nmany people now finding themselves\nspending hours in front of their\nscreens, busying themselves with their\nvirtual social life, carefully choosing\nthe pictures to upload to their profile,\nor working their brain hard to come\nup with a witty post. The more sinister\naspects of social media include cyber\nbullying. So many times now we are\nhearing stories on the news of young\nkids being driven to suicide due to\nthe uncontrollable nature of cyber-bullying. Many vulnerable young\nchildren, who make profiles on social\nplatforms, copying their friends and\nclass mates, are unaware of what\nmay befall them. Those who already\nreceive bullying at school, come back\nhome to face a new front of abuse and\ncan no longer even seek refuge in their\nown homes. We can expect to see a\nlot more regulation when it comes to\nsocial media.\nTake Facebook for example, there is\nalready an option to report someone\nwho has been posting inappropriate\ncontent or abuse towards someone,\nbut this may not be enough to tackle\nwhat seems to be an epidemic. Many\nanonymous apps such as \u2018secret\u2019\nare starting to make it big; this time\nproviding users with anonymity.\nSocial networks such as \u2018secret\u2019 may\nseem innocent at first allowing a\nteenager to confess their heartaches to\nthe world, but this may be turned into\na tool to slander or abuse someone\nunder a cover.\nAn interesting proposal for the\nfuture of social media could be\ncross platform communication. Say\nsomeone has accounts on multiple\nmediums from Twitter and MySpace\nto Google+ and YouTube, but tends to\nonly use one of them a lot more than\nothers or wants to communicate with\nsomeone else on a different platform\nbut does not want to create a new\naccount for it.

    "content": "13\nFRIDAY 21 JAN\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nA\nfter more than\ntwenty years of\nplugging away with a\nfamiliar sound, one\nthat combines jazz,\ndrone, doom and many other genres\ninto an agonisingly slow rhythm,\nBohren & der Club of Gore released\nan album earlier this month which\ndoes little to change this sound.\nTheir classic sound has been\naffectionately refered to as \u2018a black\nmetal fan\u2019s lounge jazz act\u2019. I have\nto admit I don\u2019t quite agree with\nthat, maybe a doom metal fan\nwould be more appropriate than\nblack metal. Both subgenres capture\nthe bleakness of the music, but for\nmy money doom metal is more\nappropriate, as it describes the\nquintessential aspect of their music;\nthe glacial pace at which it unfolds.\nPiano Nights is the band\u2019s eigth\nReview: Bohren & der Club of Gore\nalbum, and according to the band,\ntheir best since 2002\u2019s Black Earth,\nwhich is widely considered to\nbe their opus. I have to add that\nBlack Earth is a pretty adequate\ndescription of Bohren\u2019s sound in\ngeneral, as (although they more or\nless preceeded this development so\nit\u2019s nothing more than a coincidence)\nit reminds me of a darker version\nof Earth\u2019s recent work. To have\nthis as their best since Black Earth\nof course leaves out, among other\nalbums, Beileid, which is one of my\nfavourites and features the familiar\nand (sometimes) comforting voice\nof Mike Patton in a cover of \u2018Catch\nMy Heart\u2019 by German metal band\nWarlock. If this happens to suggest\na sense of humour, forget all about\nthat, because Piano Nights, despite\nwhat I find to be quite a funny\nalbum cover and the album name,\nis a seriously cultivated\ndirection for the band,\none which began with\nChristopher Cl\u00f6ser\u2019s\nboredom induced jam on\na grand piano before a\nshow in Moscow.\nThe band\u2019s studio\niterations resulted in\nthe use of a Yamaha\nelectric piano, which\nI guess leaves a lighter\nimpression on the\nRiaz Agahi looks at the German band\u2019s new effort - Piano Nights\nEmiel\u2019s Guide to\nJosquin des Prez, or Josquin for\nshort, was an artist of mythical\nproportions.Thiswaspartlyduetohis\nmassive talent, but also partly a result\nof the changing humanist culture.\nAt the start of his career music was\nstill grouped with geometry and\narithmetic in the Quadrivium of\ntaught subjects \u2013 something natural,\nfollowing divine laws.\nBy the time he died in his home-region of Cond\u00e9-sur-l\u2019Escaut in\nNorthern France, music was an Ars\npoetica, a poetic art whose beauty lay\nin the breaking of rules to expressive\nends. The composer came to be\nviewed in a modern sense as a poet\nof sound, blessed with talents from\nbirth. In the writings of the humanists\nand theorists who brought about this\nchange, that archetypal composer\nwas Josquin, and he would remain so\nfor a long time.\nBorn somewhere between 1840\nand 1855, Josquin\u2019s biography has\nproved difficult to piece together. He\nis first mentioned in 1466 by his true\nsurname of Lebloitte in the will of his\nuncle who leaves him a plot of land.\nAt this point he was a choir-boy in\nPicardy and likely studying under our\nfriend Ockeghem.\nAfter working in the service of\nvarious Milanese families he became\nin 1489 a member of the prestigious\nPapal choir \u2013 a recent restoration\nof the Sistine chapel revealed his\nsignature carved into walls of the\ncantoria! At the Vatican his style\nachieved maturity and he had\nabsorbed the light secular music\nof Milan and fully developed his\nwriting of sacred music. Josquin was\nthe favourite composer of one of\nEpisode VII - Josquin\nthe first music printers, Petrucci, and\nso his music gained unprecedented\ndistribution, in fact the first volume\ndedicated entirely to a single composer\nwas printed for Josquin. After he retired\nin France, his fame throughout Europe\nsteadily grew.\nSo what is it about his art that\ninspired such\nr e v e r e n c e ?\nWe can turn\nto the first\n\u2018classic\u2019, the\nfirst piece of\nmusic widely\nconsidered to\nbe great and\ntimeless \u2013\nunsurpassable\nin what it\nwas. This\nwas a motet\ncalled Ave\nMaria \u2026 Virgo\nserene, which\nP e t r u c c i\nprinted in his\nfirst collection\nof 1502. It\nrecalls Mary\u2019s\nlife and the\nmusic and\nwords fit like\na glove with\nthree fingers: 1. The declamation \u2013\nthe fit between note and syllable, 2.\nThe syntax \u2013 how each part of the text\nrelates to each part of the music, and\n3. The illustration \u2013 how the music\nparallels the meaning of the words.\n(I have borrowed these from the\nmusicologist Richard Taruskin).\nEach of the\nfive stanzas\ndescribes a\ndifferent event\nin Mary\u2019s life\nand the music\np o e t i c a l l y\nilluminates\nit\u2019s meaning,\ngiving each\nstanza a\nd i f f e r e n t\nc h a r a c t e r.\nFor example,\nwhen \u2018all\nthings in\nheaven and\nearth are filled\nwith joy\u2019, the\ntexture is\nfilled by all the\nvoices. The\n2nd stanza\nc o n c e r n s\nthe birth of\nMary and\nits harmonies are much richer as the\nimitation occurs at the interval of a fifth\nrather than the preceding octaves. The\nstanza on humility is split between two\npairs of voices \u2013 the sound becomes\nsmaller and sparser, setting up the next\nstanza which has a full homorhythmic\ntexture and is almost dance-like in its\ntriple meter. This is a work of genius\nin both its overall conception \u2013 the\nrelations between stanzas, and in the\nsmaller textural details which have\nbeen crafted down to the syllable. Every\nparameter of the music is fully under\nthe composers control and crafted to\npaint the words in sound. I encourage\nyou to listen for yourself!\nJosquin explored new territories\nin music and produced effects which\nhad not yet been heard. Theorists\nand composers look to his scores and\nstudy the way in which he achieved\nthese to this day, but most importantly\n\u2013 his immediate influence on the\nnext generation was staggering and\ncatalysed the innovations which gave\nrise to our tonal system. For example,\nthe homorhythmic declarations came\nto be viewed \u2018vertically\u2019 as chords with\ntheir own properties rather than a mere\nintersection between independently\nmoving lines. Next week we will delve\ninto this and explore how his successors\ntook up the mantle.\nClassical Music\nEmiel de Lange\nlistener than the booming register of\na grand piano.\nThe result of the dominant new\npiano based approach is something\nthat, in my opinion, is less dark than\ntheir previous aesthetic , one of the\npiano melodies even reminds me of\nVince Guaraldi\u2019s \u2018Christmas Time\nIs Here.\u2019 This may be something of\nan unflattering comparison, but only\nserves to underline the new sound,\nsomething more light and airy .\nHaving said that, structurally,\nPiano Nights is really not much\ndifferent from Bohren and co\u2019s\nprevious releases. The music is like a\nlot of music I review, quite repetitive,\noften giving the impression that\nthe music is about to stop solely by\nvirtue of the sheer slowness of the\nmusic, and the empty air between\neach drum beat, which must be\nabout 6 bpm.\nThis is not to say that it lacks a\nvariety of moods. In the course of\nthis slow, meditative journey, the\nlistener encounters both comforting\nambient-esque sax tones (although\nthe band disapproves of this\nlabel) and more sinister sounding\nmoments.\nPiano Nights is a brilliant album\nfor chilling out or working to, with\nits homogenous soundscape that\nthrows out interesting moments\nof emotion with quite a minimal,\nalmost invariant backbone.\nMy main criticism is that the\nalbum can get a little monotonous,\nperhaps Cl\u00f6ser\u2019s piano playing isn\u2019t\nversatile enough for such a dominant\nrole in the music, with the result that\nmany of the tracks sound the same.\nIt\u2019s possible that this will develop\nfurther should they continue to give\npiano such a big role in their music.\nIn spite of this, Bohren & der Club\nof Gore have produced another great\nslab of ambient doom jazz, which\nmeanders beautifully throughout\nthe album, giving a piece of work\nthat will please die hard fans and\nnew fans with a love for slow,\nemotive jazz alike.\n\n"

    "content": "18 FRIDAY 21 FEB\nARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNot such Happy Days...\nD\nisclaimer: do not book\ntickets for this as a\nFebruary blues pick-me-up. The poster\u2019s colourful,\nthe title\u2019s promising,\nbut the only comedy you\u2019ll get it the\nbleakest of tragicomedy.\nHaving said that, if you\u2019re of sturdy\ndisposition with an interest in 1960\u2019s\nsurrealist theatre, step right up.\nTo start with, you will be given two\nhours of one of the most celebrated\navant-garde plays. First performed in\n1961, Samuel Beckett\u2019s Happy Days\nseeks to portray the condition of the\nmodern woman. The whole of the two\nacts are focused entirely on the main\ncharacter, Winnie, with occasional\ncomments or grunts from her\nsurly, detached, newspaper-reading\nhusband.\nThroughout the play Winnie is\nprogressively buried in sand, unable\nto move, under scorching heat, while\nher husband, who mainly lives in a\nhole hidden form the audience, can\ncrawl around. A jarring, ear-splitting\nbell rings at intervals, giving Winnie\nher sleeping and waking times. No\nexplanation is given for this odd set\nup, and though Winnie refers vaguely\nto a previous life there is the feeling\nof being immersed in a timeless,\nunchanging landscape \u2013 the only\nmovement the sand that trickles down\non Winnie, slowly burying her alive.\nThe next bonus of this Young\nVic production is Juliet Stevenson,\nnominated for five Olivier awards\nand four BAFTAs, screen and theatre\nactress and a truly fantastic Winnie. It\nis thanks to her that this surreal, vague\noutline takes life as a terrifying reality\nof overwhelming existential panic.\nAs she sits there, buried in the sand,\nshe prattles away, sounding like a\nmiddle-class, 1960\u2019s housewife with\nher constant references to the small\nmercies in life, her reliance on her\nhandbag and her affectionate and\nirritated references to her husband.\nBut in her circumstances, these\ncommonplace instances take on\nan anguishing meaning: the small\nmercies are meaningless, as she is\ndying under the heat and the sand,\nher handbag includes hairbrushes,\nmirrors and a revolver, her husband\nsits uncaringly as she panics under the\nrising tide of sand that covers her.\nHer post-war cheeriness is\ninterspersed with rising panic,\nnonsensical comments and her\ngradual loss of memory. By the second\nact, Winnies strident, forcedly-cheerful voice has subsided into a\nresigned drone, and the blare of her\nwaking up bell rings again as again,\nforcing her to sit up and open her\nbleary, sleep deprived eyes. Happy\nDays shows a woman being tortured.\nPhysically tortured certainly, but far\nmore gruesomely mentally tortured\nby her husband\u2019s indifference, her\ninability to change her condition, her\nisolation, her loss of memory.\nFor those willing to find them, there\nare many metaphors in Happy Days:\nare we all being suppressed by the\never moving sands of time? Are we all\nbeing progressively being buried in a\nhole, relying on our daily routines to\nsurvive? Are we all screaming out to\nour nearest and dearest, as they sit\noblivious?\nI won\u2019t draw these conclusions for\nyou, but I urge you to go, and see for\nyourselves.\nAnd if all gets too much, the Young\nVic has a really good bar, the Cut. You\nmight need a fortifying drink at the\ninterval to steady yourself.\nTurandot: finished but flawed\nEmiel De Lange\nWriter\nP\nuccini\u2019s Turandot was \u201cthe\nend of the great tradition\u201d\nof Italian opera. Ever\npopular, it is the grandest\nof them all, and yet it is\ndeeply problematic. Set in a mythical\nChina, at its simplest the tale concerns\na Prince, Calaf, who wins the heart\nof the Princess of China, Turandot.\nHowever Turandot is proud \u2013 a symbol\nof the feminine of modern times,\nunwilling to make an object of herself\nthrough marriage. She has insulated\nherself from the world of men, and\nset a challenge; three riddles must be\nsolved to win her hand, and the price\nof failure is death. The opera opens\nwith the execution of an unfortunate\nprince, whose head is displayed with\nthe many other trophies, yet somehow\nCalaf decides he has fallen in love with\nthe icy Turandot.\nCalaf\u2019s love for this inaccessible,\neven frightening, woman is difficult\nto understand or empathise with.\nPerhaps it is a narcissistic one \u2013 as\na minister tellingly warns him that\n\u201cTurandot does not exist! Only the\nNothingness in which you annihilate\nyourself!\u201d The insightful and complex\npsychology of these two characters are\nthe greatest strengths of this work, and\nas Calaf passes the riddles we await\nwith great anticipation what musical\nillumination of the soul will occur for\nus, as the dismayed cold Turandot is\nthawed by Calaf\u2019s love.\nThis is the point at which Puccini\ndied of a heart attack, after undergoing\ncancer therapy in Brussels, and while\nthe libretto was completed, this final,\nclimatic scene was not. Based on his\nwritten notes, it is thought that Puccini\n\u2013 ever conscious of his contribution\nand place at the tail of the Italian\ntradition \u2013 had intended a rapturous\ntranscendence comparable to that of\nWagner\u2019s Tristan or even a mystical\ntransformation a la Parsifal. Others\nhave proposed that Puccini was simply\nnot capable of writing this immense\npsychology into his music, although\nin his final letters to the librettist he\nclaimed to have the music already\nformed in his mind. Whatever the case\nmight have been, the impossible task\nof completing the opera was given to\nanother Italian, named Franco Alfano.\nThe results are, to put it mildly,\ndisappointing, and we must content\nourselves with an unambiguously\ntriumphant and simplistic ending\nwhich limits the power of this opera\nto emotional spectacle rather than\npiercing brilliance.\nWhatever does exist of Turandot\nis presented brilliantly by the Royal\nOpera House. In this production,\nwhich is nearly 30 years old, the\nfull spectacle is unleashed. The\nstage is beautifully designed with\nsome stunningly vivid imagery, the\nhundreds of dancers and actors all\nfabulously costumed and the props\ngive a very convincing \u2018ancient China\u2019\nfeel. Puccini\u2019s mysterious grand score\nis played with practised and familiar,\nif perhaps a little careless, ease by\nthe orchestra under Nicola Luisotti.\nWhile the cast was generally excellent\nas is typical, Alfred Kim in the role\nof Calaf was a little disappointing.\nForgivably, he struggled with some of\nthe diction, but his voice lacked charm\nand seemed as cold as the character\nof Turandot. The real delight of the\nevening was Ailyn Perez as Liu, Calaf\u2019s\nadoring servant girl who sacrifices\nherself for him. Perez sang this role\nas a sweet, unassuming girl and with\ngreat beauty. For those of you who\nwish, despite its flaws, to see what\nPuccini\u2019s final and grandest opera is all\nabout, you are unlikely to find a much\nbetter production than this.\nJOHAN PERSSON\n\u00a9 ROH / TRISTRAM KENTON\nClara Clark Nevola\nWriter\nWhat: Happy Days\nWhere: Young Vic, SE1\nWhen: until 8th March\nPrice: Various\nWhat: Turandot\nWhere: Royal Opera House, WC2\nWhen: until 10th March\nPrice: Various\n\n"

Nebraska\n4. Kings of Summer\n3. Gravity\n2. Django, Unchained\n1. The Act Of Killing\nBest films of 2013\nPeter Brook\nTreasured Writer\nDirector Joshua Oppenheimer shows\nus that documentary making isn\u2019t just\nabout fly on the wall people watching\nand talking heads. He throws himself,\nand us, right into the fray with the\nmost unlikeable, disgusting and\nvillainous humans imaginable and yet\nhe finds humanity in them.\nThe film is the story of the\nIndonesian Genocide told from\nthe point of some of the men who\nperpetrated it and who have gone\nlegally unpunished.\nThey are then asked to reenact the\nmurders they perpetrated in the style\nof their favourite Hollywood movies.\nWhen they start looking at the tapes\nthey reflect for the first time on what\ntheyhavedone.Itseemstobethefirst\ntime these men start to understand\nwhat they have done and shows that\nthough they have gone unpunished\nby courts the toll it has taken on their\npsyche is massive.\nThese man are not portrayed with\nsympathy, but I think it\u2019s a movie that\nstarts to ask question about what\nmotivates people and how normal\npeople can end up committing the\nworst kind of crimes. When we filed\noutthePantonStreetOdeoneveryone\nwas in silence, it was haunting. I felt\ntorn between such anger and such\nsadness and the film sat with me for\nweeks. I still find myself churning\nover what it contained and what it\nmeans. Apologies for not knowing\nwho this quote is paraphrased from\nbut basically \u201cIt\u2019s a horrifying film,\nbut you don\u2019t get to not see it,\u201d\nThere\u2019s a reason that films nowadays\nare rarely about love, and why love is\nusually just a side-plot in a story that\ntackles broader problems. It\u2019s because\nlove stories are so easy to get wrongit\u2019s too easy to drop in a bad clich\u00e9d\nline in the dialogue, and too easy to resolve a plot strand in an obvious way.\nSometimes we\u2019ll enjoy seeing what we\nexpected to see, because sometimes\nit\u2019s just pleasing that way. But most of\nthe time, we\u2019re left wondering why all\nthe dramatic tension was built up in\nthe first place.\n[Spoilers follow]\nWith that in mind, Her is brilliant.\nIt\u2019s funny, sad, and with an eyebrow-raising premise, it really makes you\nthink. Directed by Spike Jonze (Be-ing John Malkovich), the film tells the\nstory of Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix),\na lonely man who falls in love with an\noperating system...who returns his\naffection and falls in love with him\ntoo. Though not explicitly stated, it\u2019s\napparent the film is set in a not-so-distant future, given that it features\na society who have created, and become very dependent on, technology more advanced than what we\ncurrently interact with. This OS that\nTheodore becomes enamoured with\ncan be more accurately described as\na new artificial intelligence system,\n\u2018Samantha\u2019, played by Scarlett Johansson. Samantha doesn\u2019t have a face, or a\nbody (which she frequently complains\nabout), so we and Theodore never see\nher; we only hear her sweet, sultry\nvoice.\nSpike Jonze, in his solo screenwrit-ing debut, has created a love story\nso beautiful that at times we forget\nthat Samantha isn\u2019t a physical per-son. Since the premise allows for her\nto develop emotions and desires just\nlike any ordinary human, Samantha\nis essentially a whole consciousness\ntrapped in a machine. She\u2019s lines of\ncode struggling to accept that they\u2019re\nlines of code. This ability of artificial\nintelligence is usually described as\n\u2018simulation of human emotion\u2019 - the\nCould you love her?\nreason being that Samantha isn\u2019t feeling emotion - she\u2019s simulating the\nfeeling of emotion. But then, can\u2019t it\nbe argued that we do exactly the same\nthing? The brain is nothing more than\nparts - lobes - communicating via\nnervous signals the same way electronic components do through wires\n- right? So human emotion is nothing\nmore than a simulation resulting from\nthe brain\u2019s electrical activity, isn\u2019t it?\nBut I digress. The bond Theodore\nforms with Samantha is so strong and\nreal, we\u2019re forced to repeatedly remind\nourselves that, however genuine her\nemotions are, Samantha is still just\nsoftware, and this is what sustains the\nsad, troubling undertone that exists\nthroughout the film. A film that makes\nyou fall for a character without a face\nor a body, in a world that\u2019s otherwise\nexactly like ours. A film that makes\nyou question the nature of relationships and what it means to be human.\nIn this way, Her is also a subtle analysis of the human condition. For ex-ample, [SPOILERS] Theodore writes\npersonal love letters for a living. He\u2019s\nan employee at a company who provide a service to people who struggle\nto express and communicate their\nfeelings. The film\u2019s opening shot is of\nTheodore speaking in a sweet, romantic way; it\u2019s touching, until we realise\nhe\u2019s reading one of his letters. It\u2019s a\ndarkly funny scene, but it\u2019s also quite\nunsettling, and it made me question\nwhat genuine expression of emotion\nreally is. But you might find yourself\nthinking about it differently.\nThe film features a relatively small,\nbut wonderful cast, with no subpar\nperformances. Joaquin Phoenix plays\nTheodore brilliantly, allowing us to\ntruly empathise with his character,\nwhile Amy Adams plays his longtime\nfriend, and Rooney Mara plays his\nestranged wife. And then there\u2019s Samantha, who was initially voiced by\nSamantha Morton during filming, but\nthen recast to Scarlett Johansson in\npost-production. The recast resulted\nin some alterations to the script and\nnew scenes had to be shot, but in\nmy opinion, it was the best decision\nJonze made. Johansson is brilliant in\nher role, showing off an ability to portray a variety of emotions varying in\nstrength, through simple nuances in\nher voice. Plus. her voice has a great\nnatural, sweet, flirty quality that allows the audience to really admire her\nas a genuine personality, and thus forgive Theodore for falling in love with\na computer.\nGiven the bizarre premise, this film\ncould\u2019ve easily turned out bad, so it\u2019s\nreally a statement to Jonze\u2019s ingenuity\nthat Her is now in the running for Best\nPicture and Best Original Screenplay\nat this year\u2019s Academy Awards. It\u2019s\nfunny when it needs to be, it\u2019s sweet\nand sad, and it\u2019s deeper than I\u2019d ever\nexpected.\n10. The Great Beauty\n9. Fill the Void\n8. Dans La Maison\n7. Leviathan\n6.

Blue is the Warmest Colour\nBest films of 2013\nFred Fyles\nTreasured Writer\nWhen I was writing this list, I found\nit difficult to cast my mind back to\n2013. With the past month seeing\nthe release of films such as 12 Years\na Slave, Inside Llewyn Davis, and The\nWolf of Wall Street, 2014 has gone off\nwith a bang that can make last year\u2019s\noutput seem slight in comparison.\nHowever, I haven\u2019t yet seen a film\nthat can match the emotional\nintensity of Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s\nBlue is the Warmest Colour, a three-hour long romantic epic, detailing all\nthe minutiae of first love. It earned\nits share of acclaim and controversy,\nwith the lengthy sex scenes coming\nunder fire by some critics, but at\nthe heart of the film we have two\nabsolutely mind-numbingly fantastic\nperformances from Lea Seydoux and\nnewcomer Adele Exarchopoulos,\nwho manage to express all the pain\nand joy that love can bring. Kechiche\ncrafts the film with an intimate and\nnaturalistic feel that belies its lengthy\nrunning time; Blue is the Warmest\nColour is a landmark film, and\ncompletely deserves its spot at the\ntop of my list.\n\n"

This has led to slight\nscepticism on the level of organisation\nwithin the party. However, it has\nalso shown that opposing opinion\nis respected, which is a fresh change\nfor party politics within the country.\nFurthermore, they have been\ngoverning on the streets, which has\nled to people questioning whether the\nparty knows the difference between\nadministration and activism.\nRegardless of all the criticism,\nhowever, the party has changed the\nway politics is conducted within the\ncountry. Finally, the major parties\nare feeling slightly vulnerable and are\nforced to take some concrete steps\nto improve the state of the nation.\nThe incumbent government recently\npassed their own version of the anti-graft bill which had caused the protest\nin the first place. However, it has been\ndeemed weak and ineffective and has\nbeen facing major criticism from all\nfronts. It will be interesting to see\nhow the chain of events prior to the\nupcoming general elections plays out.\nKartikeya Rana looks at a new dawn in Indian democracy\nWave of Change in Indian Politics\nKartikeya Rana\nPolitics Editor\nI\nndian politics has gone through\nthe most tumultuous period\nin the last few years. A greater\nanger and discontent with the\nincumbent establishment as well\nas a growth of severe crimes around\nthe country has led to a growing\nchangeinthewaypoliticsisconducted\nin the country. With general elections\napproaching and serious anger rising,\nit is only a matter of time until India\nstarts showing signs of a tidal change\nin its political process.\nThe Indian population has shown\ngrave discontent against the current\npolitical establishment. Over 30%\nof MLAs (Members of Legislative\nAssemblies) and MPs (Members\nof Parliament) have criminal cases\npending against them. Furthermore,\nthe Indian parliament is seen to\nbe dysfunctional, with frequent\nadjournments and no useful bills and\nlegislatures being allowed to pass by\nthe opposition due to a fear of a loss of\nsupport. However, the way politics is\nconducted in the country is gradually\nchanging due to a number of reasons.\nIndia has seen a number of events\ntaking place which have greatly\naggravated the disillusionment of the\npeople against the political system.\nCrime in India has been on a steady\nrise in recent times with an inactive\npolice unable to solve crimes. This\nhas been partly because of a lack of\nresources being provided to the police\nas well as due to rampant corruption\nwithin the police itself. Issues of rape,\nmurder and racist attacks have led\nto a growing sense of vulnerability\nof the Indian populace. The anger\nwas shown by the people in the state\nelections which showed the highest\nturnout in recent years, with an\nelectorate turnout above 60%.\nIndia is a country with a range of\ncultures, languages, religions, and\ncastes. This has led to major divisions\nwithin a broadly secular nation. Riots\nand other acts of hatred are seen to\nbe a frequent occurrence due to the\nanimosity between different peoples.\nThis has been a source of \u2018vote-bank\u2019\npolitics wherein political parties\nsupport a certain group of people to\nensure or bank on a number of votes\nwithin a particular region. This leads\nto divisive legislation and further\ndivision between racial groups. This\nhas been the case in the state of Uttar\nPradesh, where the ruling party\u2019s\nracial prejudices led to rioting and\nresultantly displacement of a large\nnumber of innocent members of the\nMuslim minority. The maintenance\nof this division is used to ensure that\nsuch parties remain in power.\nIndia also has a major income\ninequality between the rich and the\npoor. According to the Organisation\nfor Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD), the top 10%\nof wage-earners in India make 12\ntimes as much as the bottom 10%. A\nmajor role in this situation is played\nby corruption. India has shown a lot of\nanger and discontent towards the level\nof corruption in the country. In 2011,\nan anti-graft movement asking for the\nestablishment of an anti-corruption\n\u2018Jan Lokpal\u2019 Bill had caught the\nimagination of the country. Support\nfor this movement was garnered\nthroughout the country and there was\na growing hope of change within a\nrather disenchanted population.\nThe movement was unfortunately\nunsuccessful and the demands of the\nprotestors were not met. However,\na number of people in the forefront\nof the movement decided to form a\npolitical party with a slightly socialist\ninclination. Even though the party\nis only a year old, the Aam Aadmi\nParty, or the \u2018Common Man Party\u2019,\nhas managed to form a minority\ngovernment by winning the Delhi\nState Elections. The success in the\nstate elections has given them the\nconfidence to run for National\nElections which are to take place this\nyear.\nPeople have shown a lot of\nconfidence towards the AAP due to\nits stance against corruption. A large\nnumber of people from all over the\ncountry have decided to join. The idea\nof having people with a clean profile\njoin Indian politics has led to the\nreinstating of a lot of hope which had\nbeen lost. However, the party has also\nshown initial signs of a lack of political\nawareness. The party has a number\nGallery.oneindia.com\nCNN NEWS\n\n"
