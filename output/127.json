    "content": "10 FELiX\nVARIATION\nON A THEME\nIn this offering of our Supplement to the Psychopatic News we\napproach Christmas, or shall I rather\nsay, we a^ e ak up on it carefully from\nbehind - anticipating those joyous\nfestivities which terminate in the\nTraditional Boxing Day Feast of two\nfried aspirins on toast.\nWhile in festive vein, one of my\nmost regular patients (thanks to Sludge,\nthe wonder breakfast food) - gave me the\nfollowing offering \u2022\"Yuletide logs?\" said the surgeon\nHacking through some guts,\n\"They're just the thing at Xmas\nFor bolting down with nuts\".\nThis, of course, is the classical\napproach along with Dickens, Plum Pudding, bleary little Robins squatting in backyards, stage-coaches, hangovers etc.\netc. It is this very classical approach\nobserved by all true green-blooded Britishers which puzzles the foreign visitor,\nparticularly if he is from abroad, or\nsome other country, as many foreign\nvisitors are.\nFirst of all, they are puzzled by\nthe Xmas tree. Who, says the Oriental,\nbut an idiot, would go out into the\nwoods, dig down or cut up a tree, load\nit still filthy into the back of the\nHells, take it home and stick it into\na flour pot in the dining room? If you want to hang up present on something like this, what is wrong with a tame elk - the hocks come with the set.\nThe true story of the Xmas tree\ngoes back (like the Editors) into a dim and mer ky past full of legend and\nmyth. It developed from a habit of the\nAncient Britons and Picts who used\nwo ad to paint themselves. A famous Scot\nadvised them to keep right on, which\nthey did, and got to the end of the wo ad. As a result, in the coldest 3e as on of\nthe year the A;B. and P. were caught\nwith a lack of. Hence they took in\nfir trees, on the mistaken assumption\nthat the farthest branch wo ads would\nthen be accessible.\nChristmas Pudding is well known to\nIndians, of course, for it was invented\nin the Far East. It was served up, as\na protestation against British rule to\nthe High Commissioner for India by a Ragput, Ewe Go Ram. On being told that\nit was a protestation, the High Commissioner remarked \"delicious\". Christmas\nProtestation and custard soon became the\nstandard meal at this time of year. (The\ncustom of setting fire to the brandy\nover the pudding derives from the same\nsauce - \"send him a flaming protest at ion\"). Corruption has led to its being\ncalled a \"pudding\" which is a pity.\n\"Mince pies\" also have an interesting history dating back to the Hpper\nSilesian of Wessex. This is another\ncorruption, this time of the phrase\n\"minced spies\" - a delicacy enjoyed\nby the Kings of Wessex, on the principle\nthat if you are wrapped around a spy,\nhe can only inform in you, but not on\nyou.\nAnd so the list continues, a pageant of history and lies, from Boxing Day, (the day when every good Roman\nhanded his box in) through to New Year's Eve (or as it is called in Scotland\n\"Havemany\") the time for making resolutions, which I advice you all to do\nincluding -1 ) To buy every issue of Felix,\n2) Never to read \"Sig\" again\nthis to save me work.\n3) To do only what your metabolism\nprompts you to do.\nThis last is intended to keep St.\nGeorge's Hospital in business as our\nfriends.\nARE YOU ELEVEN PLUS ?\nGive the next two sets of three letters\nin each of the following:\n(1) NGU TOO GAI KO W(2) SAI F00 YIN WOR(3) JAR TZE MIN HAR\nANSWER YUM YUM in each case.\nThese three items were taken from the\nmenu.of a Chinese restaurant and\ntranslated are:-(1) Stewed eel mar with chicken in gravy.\n(2) Stewed bird's nest with mino ed chicken and water lily nut.\n(3) Fried Prawn cutlet.\nAs a matter of interest SHE JOP PAI\nAUK FAN is a disguise for rice with\nspare rib in bean gravy etc.\n1\n\\FORMAL BUFFETS\nMINES BALL\nDEC 12\n9 - 5\nTICKETS\n2G7 DOUBLE\nCABARET BAR\nCOMING EVENTS.\nFriday 3 th December.\nI.C.

Those of us who went with\na pertain amount of trepidation, with\nlast year's dismal effort still in mind,\nwere pleasantly surprised. Here was\none of the better carnivals of reo ent years.\nIts advent was viewed with some\nconcern by the organisers, as it coincided with the Annual Dinnei of the\nChemical Engineering Society - a body\nsome-what notorious for their boisterous\npost-bar behaviour. Accordingly, fairly elaborate precautions were taken to\nprevent them, and other gate-crashers\nfrom entering.\nAll revellers' hands were given a carnival stamp on the production of a ticket - unfortunately the tickets were\nnot collected, and a few 'crashers',\nobtaining a ticket from a genuine a old er, managed to get stamped. However, I the main body who tried to enter by\nbrute force were successfully repelled j by a collection of the best R.C.S. brawn |\nand two huge uniformed \"Chuckers-out\"\nThe subdued group of would-be\n'crashers' remained for some time hes- ]\nit ant ly eyeing the opposition. At\nsquare meal time they were politely asked to leave and/or forcibly ejected.\nThen started a remarkable seii es j of attacks and counter-attacks wh i oh continued until cabaret time at 1 a.m.A besotted form of strategy was employed by the determined Chemicals, who\nkept the stalwart doormen occupied while\nan inside accomplice was letting other d in through the Refectory windows. This\ncontinued ad infinitum with a steady\nflow of the same people being ejected\nthrough the door. (I saw one thrown out\nfive times!)\nThen trouble came from a different !\nquarter - about ten couples arrived from\noutside with the same intention, but (\nwere quickly escorted off the premises. >\nBack on the home front the marauders\nhad switched to another entry point, by\nprocuring ladders and entering through j the gymnasium - and the steady flow of\nejected Quildsmen continued.....\nBy this time it had become a point\nof honour far them to 'crash' into the\nCarnival - and by cabaret time they were j as determined as ever, bruised and considerably more sober I trust that j they enjoyed the cabaret !\nA lot of hard work had obviously\ngone into the cabaret; they were indeed\nfortunate in having such a lively comp-ere as Malcolm Green. That it was written by Mr Leston was only too obvious\n- it was a pity that much of the humour\nwas so coarse, and in some case rn blatantly 30. Admittedly this is the easy\nway to get laugh3, but surely it is not\nnecessary to stoop that low to humour\nsupposedly educated people?\nThe 'flats' were designed by Bruce\nCozens on the abstract theme - it is indeed good to see a higher standard of\nflat design evolving.

    "content": "SWIMMING\nThe water polo team i3 now beginning to play aa a team, and have\nscored several hard earned victories.\nThe successful run started when Regent\nSt. Poly were-defeated at the Poly\nbath, by 7 goals to 6. Although\nseemingly a close result I.C. were\nnever behind, Poly scoring three late\ngoals. Scorers:- Jones 4, Basham 2,\nLarsen 1. The next evening Q.M. C. were our guests, whom we well beat by\n4 - 2 in a hard fought game.\nScorers:- .Jones 3, Larsen 1. The\nCollege next defeated an Avondale II\nteam by 4 - 3 after a very hard, fast\nmatch. Scorers:- Basham 2, Jones 1,\nMears 1. A feature of these games\nhas been the impressed showing of Janes,\nwho is now the clubs leading goal-scorer.\nThe second team broke their loosing sequence when they defeated Chelsea\nPoly by 4-2, and in so doing, gave the\nbest exhibition of polo seen at the\nCollege this term. Scorers:- Church,\nConnor, Wilson, Hills. The previous\nevening they had put up a poor show\nagainst N.E.C., a much stronger team\nthan Chelsea, loosing 8-1.\nThe swimming section have been\ncontinuing their winning-ways. The\nfirst team, although weakened, were\nJust too strong for Q.M. C. winning by\nthe narrow margin of 2 pts. The\nsecond team visited Goldsmiths and\nshowed the power of the College reserve\nstrength, by winning every event, romping home by 37 pts to 21 pts.\nSA/L/ NG\nA student who spends th re of the\n\"best years of his( or her) life at Impe rial College and who does not take full advantage of the opportunities offered\nby the Union has missed the chance of a lifetime. Everybody in the College,\nfor example, is able to try his hand\nat a new sport, perhaps one which he\nhas never before considered. For most\npeople, sailing is just such a sport.\nThe College club sails five racing\ndinghies of the firefly class on the\nWelsh Har at Wembley,, generally recognised as the, largest and best stretch of sailing water in the London area.\nRaces are held e^ cli week-end and within\na few months most .e ople can learn to handle a boar oo:n pete i it iy enough to\ntake part.\nThe club hopes to ex ten! its activities during the summer te :\nnv and long\nvacation to cruising in larger boats\nin coast a x wat arc. People interested\nshould watch the I.O.S. C. notice board.\nATHLETICS\nSundry members of the club were\npri sed from their cocoons to compete in\na relay meeting against L.3.3.,U.C., King's and a visiting German team\nMannheim. Owing to bad traffic conditions the tourists arrived an hour and\na half late when many runners had gone\nhome, but scratch teams were entered\nwith varied results all round, glowworms being used instead of batons.\nA free tea afterwards compensated somewhat for the disappointing results.\nFELIX\nHOCKEY\nThe Hockey Club has continued to\nmaintain a high level of \"winning -efficiency\", and, considering all four\nteams, the results now show that 20 of\nof the 32 games .;ave been won and five\ndrawn.\nThe greatest share of success must\ngo to the 1st XI, who have now won 10\nof their 14 games, drawn 3a nd only\nlost one. The cup team received a great\nboost by beating Battersea in the first\nround of the U.L. Cup. Last years\nwinners, were beaten 2 - 1 in one of the\nmost exciting games of the season. If the team can keep up this standard of\npla j' for the rest of the competition,\nthen the cup should be claimed by I.C. The 2nd XI is producing equally\ngood results despite fairly constant\nchanges. The general standard of play\nin this team has improved greatly this\nterm and members of the 1 st XI are\nbeginning to realize that places can\nonly be kept by consistent play and\ngeneral keenness.\nThe 4th XI in its first season is\nshowing remarkable keenness, and by\nwinning 4 \u00b0fits first b games has\nproved that the mate -i al of a good\nteam is there. The recent provision\nof I.C. shirts has done much to\nimprove the prestige of the team \u2022\nWe are proud to relate that Nigel\nHolmes has recently been appointed vice-captain of U.L.1 st XI team. Stanton\nand Mantel continue to rush about on\nthe wings and Dave Rees (TT\non. Sec. I.C.H. C.) has established himself in the\nhalf back line.\nBASKET BALL\nThe I.C.1 st team in its 4th match\nplayed against Woolwich Poly, the\nleague's most prominent team. The team\nwas by no means outclassed, but at half\ntime were 12 points down. The second\nhalf produced two quick baskets for I.C., but tii is, however, did not result in\nvictory; Woolwich 56 ots. - I.C.48 Pts.\nThirsting for revenge we regarded\nUniversity College as mere \"Lambs to\nthe Slaughter\", despite the presence of\na Unive s it y player in their team.\nPar superior in every aspect of the game\nI.C. were never troubled, and finally\nwon by 44 pts - 22 pts.\nUnfortunate!-' for N.E.C., cur next\nopponents, I.C.1s tt~ am hit too form.\nThe team maintained an unrelenting\nores ure v jal at half time led by ^4 - 9.\nIn the second half the same high standard of play was maintained; resulting\nin a final score of 109 - 21. (which\nconstitutes a league record). The\nmagnificent performance of player/coach,\ntike Barron, must not go un heralded. Despite his lack of inches he managed\nto score 56 points.\nThe next match was against Chelsea,\ngave I.C. little trouble, with I.C. dictating the pace. The team played\nlike demons, but missed the jackpot\nby 9pts., beating Chelsea by 91 - 22.\nFor the record PW L P.P.P, A.7614V5179 II\nMOTORING\nCOLUMN\nHEAVY ENGINEERING\nIn view of the amount of white-metal found in J ez 'soil filter, she was\ntaken to the Dennis works at Guildt.\nford to check on the state of the bear-in gs.

Constant practice and at least t vo matches\nper week have given the team much needed match fitness and this is reflected\nin the results. During the past two\nweeks Q.M. C., St. Edmund Hall, O.s ford, and Kings were all beaten by 5-0 and\non Sa-tur day, November 29th Reading\nUniversity were beaten 4-1.\nIt has been a most successful\nterm and we hope, despite the calls\nof examinations, to maintain this\nrecord throughout the season.\nSOLUTION TO X WORD\n\u2022ou o q'{ j1?'op jo'6 i 'Jtsq-sv 'Li '**& *9f 'UTS 'Cf <a xd \u00aboo i \u2022\u00a3\u00a3 'of dsv 'Zi\n'JJW -of 'iz ' * s a 'zz\n'dei 'IZ '3TPI 'LX < nu0*5l'ls so,s jop rfa\" Mf T,'v*i 'ix 'J^O 'II 'eu of VF st reo j,'o i '\u00bbos '6 's ff l2T; is tami msp r;1! \u2022I 'oS-ap v'9'oip jj17' qxf aH \u2022\u00a3\n'jt is re i'Z' j Cuo Err r+ss j,r nj s s n,'Iu a oa's j Cgt py 'Vi\u00b0*Z'i* J' up o saTu0' Z+l' sp sod do \u2022-r*r' a is fi. j OTXtos *g \u00a3 *Sf\n'dc-w 'zi ' S \u00a3 SASS xi '/Iffi %z 'VisTS\n\"SZ '-\u00a3r rv 'Lz 'opT V'92'r a osd g<ua a 'zz ' ST TSI'0 Z 'STIZ^ -6i'.

A currant theory states that the initial\nattraction is, as ari r3t approximation\na function of the body forces, which .are\nis u ally expressed in terms\nof three variables. The purpose of\nthis paper is to show that by *he use\nof dimensional analysis these variables\no an be combined into a dimensionless\ngroup , or number. -This number o an be\nused as a basis for comp rr is on and dis-cus sion, and can be correlated with experimentally determined coefficients of\nattraction.\nLet the variables be denoted by\nW and H respectively. Each has the\ndimension of length, and for strong\nattraction B should be much larger than\nW, and also H should be larger than W. Choosing that an increase in the attraction coefficient corresponds to an\nincrease in the value of the dimensionless group, this group can be defined as\nIt is suggested that, following\nscientific custom, this number should\nbe named after a well-established and\nfrom in ent contributor to this work\no.f. Reynolds, Mach, Prandtl etc.)\nand this number will hereafter be called the Monroe Number, Mo.\nThe Monroe number can be readily\nmeasured at any time for individual\nspecimens, and since it is dimensionless it is possible to compare values\nregardless of whether the units of\nmeasurement are inches or centimetres,\nprovided the units are consistent.\nThis facilitates ready comparison between English and Continental specimens.\nThe coefficient *i attraction is defined as the probability of general\npositive or approving response amongst\nMale specimens. This can be statistically determined for various values of\nMo., both from direct experiment and\nby inference from published data. In\nthis way, the coefficient of attraction\ncan be found as a function of Mo.\nRecent workers in this field (cf.Sab-rina, Mansfield) have enabled data to\nbe obtained for very high values of Mo.\nIt is well known that Mo. for a particular specimen is a function of\nthe age of that specimen. Between\nthe ages of 10 and 20 years Mo rises\nsignificantly, and after attaining a peak value falls slowly through the\nlife of the specimen, tho.gh the rate\nof decay may increase by a high dissipation coefficient. By correlating\nthe coefficient of attraction with age,\nthe ages of Hope and Despair can be\nfound.\nMany specimens are known to at tsn pt to alter their attraction co-s ff ici ent bj artificial means. Now,\n>\ny calculating the effects on their\nip parent Mo. it is possible to decide\nle tween, say, an increment of B or aec re ment of W, and consequently base\nuch alterations on established data.\nIrperial's a worthy name, denotes\nthat learned place,\nWhere all the time they're hard at\nwork to lead the British race;\nThey're the butt of other students, v the examiner's last sigh\nWhich really when you think a while,\nthey hardly would deny.\nScientia is always found in every little dive\nFrom Earls Court Road to Palace Gate,\nand back tc Mqoney's hive;\nThey're sitting drinking coffee, or\npropping up a bar\nWhile all the time their College wor!:\nis dropping under par.\nImperii, Imperii, there's nothing\nlike Imperity\nThey never break the natural law, the\nlaw of deep depravity;\nAcross\n1.

As expected the\nunprintable section attracted the greatest attention, and it must be added that,\nin general, the entries were of a surprisingly high literary standard.\nBy far the best came from J.R.

We\nwould ask him to collect them as soon\nas possible, or else they will be shot.\nThe printable section was less popular and obviously no-one had really\ntried over-hard. There was a_ little originality in some of t ne entries, but\nthe majority were of little merit. A few of the better ones appear below:-P.M.

As a result of his researches he\npatented a trap which caught more mice\nnot only more quickly but also in less\ntime than any other. This trap was\nnaturally a great success, but sales\nshortly began to fall off owing to the\ncat as troph is decrease in the mio e pop-ul ation, l. 'ore mice were urgently\nneeded and it was to this problem that\nyoung Antonio presently devoted him-self. \"Now\" he reasoned, \"no more mice\nare to be found on the face of the Earth.\nTherefore,\"he concluded\"triumphantly \" it will be necessary to drill for them.\"\nSo Antonio consulted the Geology\nDepartment and on their advice sought\nout the li kli est location. Then he\nset up his gear and commenced operations.\nHe was just getting down to 13,000 ft., when suddenly there shot up into the a air a vast gusher of ferocious super-mice, each one armed with a hacksaw and\ncarrying a pair of wire cutters. Quick\nas a flash Antonio leapt into his spaceship and hurtled off to Kars to start a new division of I.C.I. "

    "content": "FELIX\n5\nDOWN AND I have just been on a conducted\ncrawl through the air-tunnels under\nE.C. S. The idea was that they should\nbe written about, and it is well known\nin certain circles that I am literate.\n(I imagine people pointing me out to\nvisitors from Cambridge who have noticed\nme already: 'You see that Hoffnung creation over there - that's one of our literate undergraduates! 'You mean - in a science oo lle ge?) And yet, I have nothing positive\nto say. Even before I went down\ninto the tunnels I mean - an acquaintance\nsaid he knew exactly how I was going tc\ndo it. Only he never told me and, like I say, I don't know. I only know that\nthere are two sorts of tunnel: Hot and\nCold. All else is - no, not mystery.\nA mystery can be stated. How did the\ncorpse get under the Main Physics Lecture Theatre? Whose are the echoing\nfootsteps? \"\nWhat happened to the\nfourth member of our gallant party?\nIt is questions like these that make\nwriters like me scribble like mad.\nBut there is not even a mystery. Why\nisn't there? I mean, damm it. Why should there be? There we\nhave our mystery. We know why physicists have dragged themselves through\nfilthy holes about fifteen inches by\ntwo feet. Because they, like the\nHimalayas, are there. The ff ira r^ay as, however, not only had Hillary\nclimbing up them to get them int\"> the\nnews, they had the Abominable Snowman\nclimbing down. Of the two, the latter\nwas more popular, purely because it was\nmysterious, alien, while Hillary was a model of respectability, or none of the\nadvertisers would have mentioned him.\nThe advertisers knew that our lives, and\nhence our spending, are ruled by good\nsense, and the men of Fleet St-eet knew\nthat our minds are ruled by the opposite.\nBetween them they gave us articles called\nThe Yeti - Is it Human? surrounded by\npoints of information like 'The Everest\nExpedition Chose .... Spark Plugs'.\nNothing abominable lurks beneath\nR.C.S. That is what moved the tunnel-ler s to invite me down there. You\nmay laugh. These adventurers had explored the lower regions with great care\nand found nothing even 3lightly enigmatic. As you see, they were reduced\nto taking with then bottles of Fremlin's Brown - actually importing mystery - and\nphotographing themselves drinking it. Still there was no sav our, no romance.\nBeer had failed. Next, in ascending\norder of subtlety, came women, song and\nculture. The first, I gathered, was\nimpracticable, the second wa~ j po radio ally attempted, and the last was me.\nMy guides indicated the points of inter-est: writings left by a pioneer ro up in '46, primitive drawings of bison,\nthe pipe that Haggis raised a lump in by banging his nut on it. OUT BY FRED WHEELER\nI said I'd think of something.\nWhat about a coffee bar. Not\nanother? Yes, just one. Probably\npatrons would pay as much as one-and-six a cup if they literally had to\ngrovel in the dirt for it. Those who\nlike character with their coffee -and when civilisation is all around,\ncharacter is simply unpleasantness - are\nfrustrated even by that famous place\nwhere the light shines from the eye-sockets of skulls, the tables are tiny\ncoffins and the murals depict skeletons\nembracing naked girls and vice versa:\nfor me, the only really macabre thing\nhere is the apparent waiter (living, and\nclothed like a coffee-bar waiter) whose\nchief function is to follow new arrivals and tell them it is self-service.\nThe fact is that the slightest\nactual inconvenience is more disturbing than the most perverted decorations,\nalthough few of us realise this. Our\narchetype is Albert in his Memorial,\nsurrounded by a mass of rich decoration\nthat fails to keep the pigeons off:\nthe living, defacing pigeons .\nI'm off again. Off the subject\nas well. What to do with the air ducts. Something must be done with\nthem, obviously, because the college\nis crowded and they are empty.\nIt has been suggested that the\nwalls should be decorated - decoration\nagain - in the palaeolithic style, and\nsignposted. I find this idea vaguely\nfrightening. After wall-paintings,\nnotices and mildly curious visitors,\nwhat? Perhaps I fear the notices\nmost - the letter kUl eth.( Hence the\nEditor's name. ) At first vs shall be\noffered polite advice like Mind Your\nHead, LEFT Shoulder Forward, Crawl For\nSix Feet, and so on. An then, insidiously, a new generation of notices will\nappear, not ioe s without respect. No\nSmoking, they will probably tell us,\nor, To Litter The Tunnels Is An Offence.\nWith growing insubordination they will begin to utter threatening wards like\nPrivate, No Entry and finally Silence!\nAnd civilisation will be upon us.\nCivilisation is to be avoided at\nall costs. You 3tart by saying that\nyou like your comfort, and you wind up,\nlike poor Lady Docker, complaining\nthat you simply cannot live without the\nRiviera. Remember, comforts and\nrestrictions are inseparable: the tramp\nand the true arar chi st are one, having\nrejected both.\nSo let us leave the tunnels to\nthe anarchists. They will not blow\nus up. Why should they? All they\nwant is freedom from our company, our\nnoise, our conventions and our respect-ability.., Anarchists are reduced to\nnihilism - blowing everything up, that\nis only when there is no other escape.\nIf we restrain ourselves from cleaning,\npainting and mapping, the dirt and darkness will defend the anarchists from\nthe intrusions of their over-friendly\nenemies, and they will be able to advertise their retreat openly. All the\nanti-social characters who don't join\nclubs will no longer wander about in their spare time looking lost, untidy\n....continued in next column\nTHOUGHTS OF AN\nUN FORTUNA TE\nENGINEER Oft when I rest from all the toils\nRequired to prove that water boils,\nIs it and muse and wonder why\nWe ever use dx/dy.\nWith Infinitesimal Calculus,Incomprehensible is this stuff, -We play around with C*3 of G, And volumes, too, so eS X can see\nThat Maths to us is no delight\nWe Engineers, whose minds are right.\nThe Civils, in their concrete, see\nCurves and Conies, (not for me):\nWhilst for Mechanicals pure and simple,\nThe details of a turbine's dimple.\nElectricals on the other hand\nThink of an exponential band.\nAeros in their flighty moods\nTeach logic to the lesser broods.\nThe Chemicals -j no ving things by bucket,\nShow us all that they can rough it.

Despite\nthe Post Office attractions, we are taking teams for hockey, netball, swimming,\ntennis, table-tennis and badminton. We\nexpect to play our matches on four days\nand spend two days sight-see i\\.^?e have already had many male volunteers\nfor masseurs, trainers etc., but, alas,\nour grant is for I.C. W.S.C. only. However, we would appreciate a ceremonial\nsend-off from Liverpool Street Station\nabout 8 - CO a.m. on Monday 15 December.\nSWIMMING\nWe have again, since very few\nfresher s are willing to take to water,\nentered the U.L. W.S.C. League with\nMiddlesex Hospital. This year, the\nLeague has two sections, and we, after\nour efforts last year are in the first section. So far we have won two matches\nand lost one.\nThis is mainly due to Elizabeth Ferris, the Olympic diver who is ir. her\nfirst year at Middlesex Hospital. Her\nstandard of swimming is much above the\nrest of the team. Unfortunately, I. C.W. S. effort is restricted to a few\nold faithfuls, it would be pleasing\nif fresher s could remember their Freshers Reception cro mia e. Nevertheless\n- I think t at we shall do well in the\nLeague - if not by our efforts. TABLE - TENNIS\nThe table tenn-is team has lave d three match eet i \u00a3 term's next te cm they\nhone to win at least one match.\nHOCKEY\nIi. first match we were :c:iv inc ingly beaten 5 - Q by ILLngs II. The\nteam wa-j. acre practise1 and fitter for \u2022.he match against Chelsea Poly I, a draw resulted. The next match we\ndefeated Birk beck I,4 mainly\nbecause of a. much improved forward\nline. I. C.W. A. Hockey team had the \"Hon-our\" of playing the I.C. Sports Club,\nin their1 st fixture of the sea.-on, at\nHarlin ton on Sunday 23 Nocember. The\n-porta Club fielded a far fitter, faster\nand stronger team producing some very\ngood hoc.:r/ players from the Rugby Club.\nThe game was fast ana clean, but I. C.W. A, could make only a. light impression,\nlosing by 4 goals to 2. The entertainment Wc iS continued afterwards in the bar\nand on the dance floor. I. C.W. A. congratulate the I.C. Sports Club for\ntheir chivalry on and off the field.\nSQUASH\nI. G.'.S.C. has now seven squash\nr layers, only two these having any\nprevious experience on the courts.\nThe Men's Squash Club have given us a few train in\" periods which ha-^e helped\nconsiderably. In our first match we\nwere decisively beaten 5 - 0 by U.C. With mors practice the match against\n3.B.C. resulted in a J2 win. Against\nWestfield our standard of play was o on sia jer ahly improved, but we lost 3 - 2 . The\nmatch against Cardiff was cancelled,\nbecause the team never got there?\nRUGBY\nOn Saturday 15 November, the 1st. IT\nhad a very successful \"expedition\" to\nSomerset, when they lost to Bridgwater,\na first class West Country club, by\n5 - 0 . Despite the slippery conditions\nthe team played up to the occasion. The\nevenings rite:-tain ra ent lasted until 4 -30 a.m. for 3\n0\nme, and was particularly\nenjoyed by the Hon(?) Fixture Secretary.\nThe following Wednesday the team\nmet L.S.E. in the second round of the\nU.L. Cup. This was an away game\nplayed in good conditions, and resulted\nin a decisive win for I.C.(12 pts. to\nC). Milward and 'ar gret ts Poth scored\ntries, whilst Phillips licked two good\npenalties. In the next round, on\nFebruary 11th,1559, the club meet Wye\nCollege.\nLast Saturday the 1 st XV played a strong Saracens ex-1 st team in slippery\nconditions, with the emphasis on forward\nplay; tis game mar Js the first occasion\nupon which our pack has really been\nmastered. At half time there was no\nscore, and the result still unpredictable\nEarly in the second half two good tries,\nhowever, decided the game in Saracen's favour. The final score at the end of\na very hard fought game was 6 - 0 .\nContrary to many opinions the fact, that\nhalf of the team had been to the Il.C.S. carnival, did not affect the result.\nTomorrow's games represent the\nlast for the I.C. teams this te m, and\nwith true Christmas \" s rir it\" we aim\nto win them all, thus rounding off an\nen.i oy able term's Rugby.\nSOCCER\nThe 1st XI, undefeated in their\nlast six matches, drew 1-1 last Wednesday against St. '\n.\n-.\nark and St. John's College. The following Wednesday\nthe team played University College in\na League match, and, as anticipated, a very hard game ensued. After leading\n1-0 at half-time, a forceful header by\nYoung, the team played very well in\nthe second half and the final result\n1-1 was a true reflection of the\nmatch. The 1st XI record this season is:-P14G. F.41G. A.41 On Saturday Nov. 22, the 2nd and 3rd XI's had very easy matches\nagainst Brasenose College I and New\nCollege I, winning 8-2 and 6-3 respect-iv ely. The following Wednesday the two\nteams, continuing their winning farm\nbeat Royal Dentals (3-1) and R.N.C. Greenwich (3-1). The teams record\nthis season is:-2nd XI 13\n3rd XI 14\nWDL G.F. G.A.70653337254425 The 4th,5 th and 6th teams have\ncontinued to play well in their games\nand s nou id do quite well in their\nrespective divisions. Their performances this year are shown by:-40\n46\nThe 7th XI is still continuing\nto function and has played eight matches so far this season. Several of\ntheir games have been cancelled due\nsolely to the unfit state of grounds\nand all these by opponents.\nP WDL G.F.4 th15735545 th12903646 th148 l559 CROSS COUNTRY\nThe Cross Country Club has continued\nto be very successful during the past\nfortnight. There have been no first\nteam matches in this period, as six\nI.C. men have been running in the two\nU.L. teams, but I.C. II have defeated\nMarjons, R.A.F. Cranwell, Repton School\nand S.W. Essex Tech. College, while\nI. C.Ill have beaten two teams, Barclays Bank and Royal Vets II, losing\nto Wimbledon A.G. For the second team the Marjons\nand S.W. E.T.C. races, both on away\ncourses, were easy victories. However, the race against Cranwell and\nRepton, over the Cranwell course, was\nvery closely fought. All three teams\nwere very evenly matched, the final\nresult being:\n1. I.C. II, 52 pts.\n2. Repton, 54 pts.\n3. Cranwell, 65 pts.\nThe individual winner, by 2 seconds,\nwas G.P. Tilly, the I.C. Captain.\nThis is the first season in which\nthe club has had third team fixtures,\nand it is most encouraging to see that\nI. C.Ill can win races.\nFinally, in a triangular match at\nPetersham, an I.C.\"A\" team scoring 62\npts. were beaten into third place by\nLloyds (49; and kings I(6l).

    "content": "FELIX\n\u2022 HE HOSTEL CONTROVERSY The Editor- FFTXKOh DearASiir,,\nThe protagonists of Constituent\nCollege Itostel3 have taken for granted\nt*c things - (a) that non-segregated\nhostels will mean the end of Guilds,\nHinu? md R.C.S., and (b) that this\n\u00bbOIA1/J be a bad thing for the Imperial\nCollege.\nLet's face it the constituent\nunions are nothing more than faculty\nsocieties and as such they should be\nconcerned with working conditions, staff\nstudent relationships ( the rel event committee in R.G. S. died of neglect a few years ago) and other matters peculiar to their faculty. Instead\nthey serve as excuses for childish and\nirresponsible behaviour. By all means\nnave rivalry, but the importance of the\nunions has thereby been so exaggerated\nthat now we have executive members of\nthese mere faculty societies (all the\nsegregationists are or have been such)\nactually complaining that they weren't consulted about, who should live in the new\nhostels. How big-headed can one get?\nMessrs. Warwicker, King etc, want\nthe unions to 'command greater loyalty!\nI'm afraid they visualise themselves\nsailing forth at the head (or in the\nvan) of screaming hordes to tether a nanny-goat on the roof of Guilds. The\nunions deserve no loyalty whatsoever\n(other than support for sporting\nfixtures) unless they benefit the individual members and as far as individuals are concerned, segregation would\ncertainly not \"\nbe a good thing. Not\nonly would a hostel-dwelling scientist\nnot meet students of art, languages,\nlaw, medicine and music; he would meet\neven fewer engineers and miners than\nat present. For sheer narrowness of\nmind, segregation and its products will\nbe hard to heat.\nI don't think that non-segregated\nhostels will mean the end of the constituent college unions - faculties will\nlast for ever - but I hope that they\nwill help to cut these unions down to\nsize, because in their present state\nthe latter are a very bad thing for I.C. The sooner we have some faculty societies working in the interests of students\nand the sooner we throw out the budding\nempire builders who are sapping the\nstrength of the I.C. Union, the better.\nGiven strong\" leadership and support\nfrom the faculties it would be a very\nfine Onion, although having fewer\nmeetings than ever before isn't going\nto help matters.\nCompliments of the season,\nP.H. Levin\near Sir,\nI must disagree with the views expressed by some of the elder statesmen\nof the College in a letter to the last\nedition of \"Felix\" on the subject of\nCollege loyalties and the new halls of\nresidence.\nIf, as they infer, these loyalties\nare dying, I would suggest that they\nshould be allowed to die and not be art-if ici ally fostered by grouping R.C.S. an exclusively or Guildsraen exclusively\nin one ii os tex. CONCERT FOR CONNECTION WITH MOUNTAINEERING\nSEE NELSON\nMOUNTAINEERING CLUB At the beginning of the year,\nowing mainly to disagreements with\nvarious examiners,the Club lost many of\nits leading climbers. However, with the\nremaining members, plus some very promising fresher s, the standard of rock\nclimbing is gradually rising again\ntowards last years very exceptional\nlevel.\nFollowing on the Alpine Meet\ndescribed during an earlier issue, the\nfirst meet of term vr as the fresher s meet in N. Wales in the Ogwen Valley.\nThe climbing offered here has long been\nrecognised a \u00a3 ideal for beginners, the\n-val: C. ces bi ing neither too steep nor\ntoo e.< sed.

Xtrinr\"\nthe o our se of the weekend, again\nblessed by reasonable v/e a the., numerous\ngoo co limbs were undertaken, \"hi le several parties also traversed the\nSnowdcn Horseshoe, including one unsuccessful attempt by night.\nIn conclusion, the Club hopes to\nhold . Chvistma:. Meet in the Scottish\nHighlands with the idea of attempting\nsome snow and ice climbing, this\nproviding a pleasant variation en the\nnormal British rock climbing.\nThe principal shortcoming of this\nproposal would seem to me to be the in creased risk of insularity and ; re-occupation with studies amor.g su the\nresidents which would result if they\n\u2022?ere all drawn from the same faculty of\nthe College.\nI would suggest that the contrary\nproposal,that the new hostels should be\nmade open to student of the University\nas a whole^is more valuables\nYours faithfully,\nMartin Barnes.\nAlthough concerts are far from be\nbeing the ideal places for the perform-a noes of good jazz - they stifle audience\nencouragement of the players and the\nkick that comes from a crowded throng\nof dancers - some excellent jazz music\nwas presented by the Imperial College\nJazz Club during the lunch break of\nNovember 20th. The poor start by the I.C. Jazz\nBand was due to the presence of a new\nand unrehearsed ola r in etti st and also\nto nerves: those who have heard this\nband, under its leader John Gowland, at\ndances know that it is capable of much\nbetter playing. The outstanding musician in this group at the concert was\nthe greatly improved pianist Chandu\nKapur. Then o a me Richard Rushton, a bop pianist with an original style and\ngreat technical ability.-A guitar solo by Adrian Abbot was\nmarred by amplifier trouble, but in any\ncase it was a novelty piece rather than\njazz, Stan Salmons, a fresher in Chemistry, then introduced a quartet with\nhimself on piano. He is an excellent\nBrubeck-fashion pianist with impeccable\nrhythm and he was well served by Gordon\nPritchard on Drums and John Farnsworth\non Bass - the last named, in the opinion\nof many, the most improved jazz musician\nin I.C. Anne Phillips sang one number\nwith the quartet; she sang well but\nwas inadequately amplified.\nFinally, Denis Leston (piano) introduced a mixed group in a jam session:\nthis included a remarkable trumpeter in\nTony Newstead. Newstead, one-time\npresident of the Melbourne University\n.Rhythm Olub and now aP.G. in0 \u00a3 G, exemplified all that is best in jazz\n- excitement, originality, technical\ncompetence of the virtuoso grade, a strong lea'1\n* to other j 'rout-line ins-tru mentalist s; these ann more were to\nbe found in his playing. Amongst the\nmusicians playing alongside Newstead,\nMike Newson stood out on clarinet: he\nplays loud and clear and is quick to\nseize on a riff or phrase worth developing - when he gets rid of the tear-away elements of the screaming early\nclarinettists he should be a fine jazz\nartist.\nLUCY K AS S LER There were some more newcomers to\ndebating last Tuesday when the house\ndecided to prefer a Saucy Sue to a Lovely Lucy by about 250 votes to 10.\nPart of this landslide victory for\nthe Saucy Sue's was doubtless due to\nthe charming presence of Miss Pamela\nGwytiier from Bedford College.\nLovely Lucy Ks s ler entertainingly\navoided talking on the motion.

    "content": "FELIX 3\nGENERAL STUDIES\nPHOTOS ETC. \"That is the use of a hook without\npictures?\" thought Alice, as she sat\non the bank idly turning over the pages.\nAmongst industrial firms, pio ture s have now become a very powerful weapon\nboth for advertising and educational\npurposes, as Mr. CD. Knight pointed\nout in his lecture on \"Photography and\nPublic Relations\". Photos are the\ncheapest form of visual media, and as\n\"stoppers\" (pictures wh i oh make one\nstop and look more carefully when flicking through a book) they can be used\nfor many years in magazines, adverts\nand window displays.\nWhen photographs are used for distribution to the public, it is of the\ngreatest importance that the photo-graph er, who is essentially a creative\nman, works in close oo\u2014operation with\nthe Public Relations Officer in the\nproduction of pamphlets: in fact, so\ngreat has been the change since the war\nthat industrial organisations now run\ntheir own photographic departments, and\na good professional photographer can\neasily earn \u00a350 in a day. This is a far cry from the half-crown paid for\nphotos for house magazines before the\nwar.\nNowadays many firms photograph\nevery component of machines they manu-fact ure, and all the negatives are\nfiled: as example, Mr. Knight quoted\nthe Ford Motor Company in Detroit, wh-i oh has a file of 3j million negatives,\nand his own company, Shell, which has\na file of 65,000 negatives and an\nincrease of 7000 per annum. The Hoover Company even u \u00ab.e film for time and\nmotion studies to increase the efficiency of their staff and methods.\nThe Speaker then gave a brief outline of the advances in the use of\nphotography in Shell: their unit was\nformed in 1946 to help in the standardisation of ideas and methods throughout the world-wide subsidiaries of the\nCompany, and to build up the morale of\ntheir workers by showing them how oil is produced, and how it is used by\nmany diverse industries. The next step\nwas the introduction of pictures into\nCompany Reports to enable shareholders\nto keep abreast of new ideas and ad-vance s. Apart from such literature produced\nfor individual consumption, exhibitions\nwere prepared and shown in many parts\nof the world to groups in libraries,\ndepartmental stores, and so on: these\npictures were not used for advertising\nin any way, but were made to demonstrate the perfume industry in France,\nthe watch industry in Switzerland, and\nothers dependant on oil, with only a passing reference to oil itself.\nFinally, as an example of the\npresent trend, Bowaters (the paper firm)\nhas shown a film recently to shareholders at the Festival Hall on the\nFirms' developments during the previous\nyear.\nMr. Knight ended his talk with some\nslides taken in Africa, and used by\nShell for publicity.\nDRAMATIC SOCIETY IN THE BET The I.C. entry for this year's TJ.L. One-Act Play competition was an\nadaptation of Chekov's \"The 3et\". Set in a Banker's house on the outskirts of Moscow in the year 1890, it tells of a bet made between the Banker\nAnd an apparently eccentric Lawyer that\nthe latter cannot stay in solitary confinement for a period of ten years: the\nsum involved is a million pounds, while\nthe Lawyer stands to forfeit the house\nhe has just bought - a house to which\nthe Banker has taken a fancy.\nAlso in the cast is a Doctor, a very\nold friend of the Banker, and a Novelist\nwho acts as narrator for this adaptation.\nEvery 30 often the three me jt to -discuss\nhow the Lawyer is faring in thi shed at\nthe bottom of the garden, and as time\ngoes on, the Banker becomes morS lenient\nin his conditions: the Lawyer receives\nas many books . .'t fid any amount of food\nhe :|\nema ii ds, as well as a servant to tidy\nhis room.\nThe play ends as expected, for, ^\nas the lawyer explains when his ten a^s years are almost completed he has been\nable to live the events he wished from\nbooks,with all the characters and places\nmoulded according to his fancy, and therefore more perfect than the ret.1 t ing.\nWhat use had he for a million:\nPeter Bowden, as the Banker, was\nextremely convincing, except for one\nweak scene when the bet itself was\nbeing made, and he was consciously\nacting the whole time: Desmond Turner\n(the Lawyer) was also weak in the first\nscene, spending too much time with his\nback to the audience, and te ii ding to\nlose the ends of many of his words.\nHe improved during his monologue in the\nscene, but here again there was insufficient variety of action.\nThe Novelist was an unfortunate ;art\ndue to the braking effect it had on the\ncontinuity, but even so Ross 3ut ler v:a3 not forceful enough \u00b1n the part, and he\nwas made up to be too young. The small\npart of the Doctor was well portrayed\nby Terry Wright.\nLighting and scenery were simple\nand effective, but why was a stray green\nlight focussed on the Lawyer's books in\nthe last scene? Such effects, to be\nsuccessful, must be unobtrusive.\nBut, for a difficult production,\nmore credit is due to the producer,\nPeter Morgan, than the review in Sennet\nwould suggest.\nLIBERAL POLICY The second Mock Parliment of the\nSession met on Thursday last with\na Liberal government\"and Labour opp osi tion.\nAfter a policy statement the discussion centred on capitalism. The\ngovernment claimed that competitive\ncapitalism meant efficiency and low\nprices. They thought ownership should\nbe spread over the employees by co-ownership schemes. The socialists disputed the efficiency of competition\nsaying that much organisation was\nduplicated and that competition itself was often eliminated by the formation\nof monopolies. They thought that the\nnumber of shares that could be distributed among the workers would be too\nsmall to give them appreciable power.\nThe absence of Conservative opinion\nwa3 felt when the House found itself\nto be in agreement on colonial and\nforeign affairs.\nA bill to replace the House of\nLords by elected group representatives\nwas defeated. An opposition am mend ment to abolish the Lords was narrowly\nrejected. The opposition also suggested that the Advisory Council to the\nPeoples Representative Assembly should\npublish a quarterly report in the form\nof a red paper.\nThe electoral- reform bill introduced the single transferable note and\nsome seats allotted by proportional\nrepresentation. This is not official\nLiberal policy and the government\nwas embarrassed by as peach from the\nfloor supporting the party line. The\nopposition ac cussed the Liberals of\nself interest pointing out that the\nsystem favoured the centre party.\nHowever, the government said the bill was a simple way to rectify present\ninjustice. A proposal to have some\nnon-constituency M.P.s solely concerned\nwith national affairs was also critic i sed. The bill was defeated.\nAt question time the Trade Unions\nwere discussed. The government thought that members should have to contract\nin and not just be able to contract out\nof the political levy. The opposition\nsaid that the Trade Unions should only\nbe reformed from within and that this\nproposal would loose the Labour Party\nmoney, whereupon the Liberals returned\nthe charge of self interest.\nThe House adjourned at 10 o 'clock\nmainly to the bar.\nA.D.m J: W\\.

    "content": "8 FELIX\n2 0 YEARS HENCE( FROM THE FELIX OF OCTOBER 29 1978)\nISLAND SITE ALMOST READY\nLast Thursday the Director-General of the Imperial Technical College,\nin the University of Kensington, spoke\nto an invited audience of Professors in the Techtopian Hall. Owing to the presence of journalists being forbidden by\nthe Director of College Security, the\nonly report available of the D G1\ns address is that issued by the Chancellor\nof Publications.\n\"During the last Technological Year\nthe Board of Inspectors has permitted\nl JOO technocrats to be awarded Diplomas\nand Associate3hips in recognition of\ntheir devotion to the doctrines of our\neminent establishment. Former Diplomates now hold a large percentage of\nthe Chairmen's seats of our public org-an is at ions. The industrial pre-emin-en ce of our country is due, in no small\nmeasure, to their inspired leadership.\n\"The rebuilding of our main site,\nbegun many years ago, proceeds apace;\nfinal landscaping with the siting of\nstatuary, symbolic of our heritage,\nshould be complete next summer. It\nis, however, with no small measure of\nregret, that our final relic of last\noen tur y's Empire had to be demolished\nin view of its Pisa-like tendencies.\nColcutt's Campanile, a symbol of Victorian morals, proved to be of insufficient strength tp support our atomic\npowered stereo-colour vision station\nwhich has for many years been the major\ndisse minato r of technic o pro gag and a. \"Our thanks are due to the United\nGrand Lodge of Space-Travelling Professors, for their munificent benefaction\nof \u00a3500,000 and vast quantities of\nmoonshine. This will be a spur for our\ncharge in the investigation of the primeval\noccupations of the inhabitants of outer\nspace.\n\"Our ever-growing resident pop-ul ation, an increase of sixteen over\nthe last week, has called for an expansion of our existential rooms. To meet\nthis contingency, only married couples\nare permitted to rent a room for their\nown exclusive use, all other students\nwill be required to live a Cox and Box\nlife. For this purpose Professorial\ndeclamations will be issued in duplicate\nat twelve hour intervals. All students will be required to attend these\ninstructions, under the pain of elimination, and deportation to the Farm,\nat Silwood Park. In passing, I should\nmention that over the last fifteen years three wardens have seen fit to\ncommit suicide from the balconies of\nthier tenth story penthouse flats. Little truth is attached to the\nrumours that their minds were\nderanged by a former Domestic Charge\nd 'Affairs, but in view of the Coroner's remarks, this post has now been\nabolished.\n\"On excursions through our newly\ncreated heritage avoiding whenever\npossible the manu mated gardeners, the\nfeeling of over-powering monumental it y. is ever-pre3en t. Vast slaps of concrete,\nfaced with -.^rie gated slate, and fast\ndarkening Portland stone, soar up into\nthe azure skies. The serie d files of\nglass, mirror the suns rays into the\ndarkest recesses of the neighbouring\ncourtyards.\n\"Turning over now to student affairs,\nthe Union, with its compulsory membership\nmoves from strength to strength. As a result of their ever increasing numbers,\nfurther committees have been created,\nin order to control the committees\nalready existing. Overall control is, however, vested in the small central\np rae sidi um which meats regularly in the\nPresidents offices. Owing to the\npressure of compulsory 3tud y the time\navailable for extra-technical interests\nhas been unavoidably reduced.\n\"In conclusion, Professors, I give\nyou the charge; press on with your\nresearches, instil into your students\nthe necessity for hard work, give to\nthe world the benefit of your skill.\" COMMENT John Taylor writes:\nThe Director-General' s address\nmakes interesting reading. The development of College follows the well\nworn paths of Administrative monoliths.\nAs a student di ring the early days of\nthe re bul ding scheme it was with interest that I read of its impending com-ple tion.

    "content": "FELIX\nLETTERS I.C. INDECISION\nDear Sir,\nDoes an attitude of indecision\nprevail-at I.C,? Is it considered reasonable that people may commit themselves to any particular College activity and then reserve the right to\nwithdraw at a moments notice? Judging\nfrom recent Mountaineering Club and\nY. H.A. Meets, and by glancing down, for\nexample, the Athletics team lists, the\nanswer would seem to be yes!\nIt must be pointed out to these\nsomewhat thoughtless people that such\nlast minute in decisions not only cause\nclub organisers endless trouble, but\nalso show a complete lack of responsibility on the offenders part.\nYours faithfully,\nW.A.T.

CARDSHARPERS\nDear Sir,\nThe Upper Lounge in the Union Building-has been commandeered by a small\ngroup of cards harpers who unfortunately find it necessary to accompany this\namusement by high spirits and very loud\nvo ioe s. If the lounge was intended for\nsuch purposes I apologise to these gent-le men. If not, is there any constitutional means by wh i oh reasonable quietness could be enforced, as such prattle\nmust drive many people from this very\ncomfortable room!\nYours\nJ. Latham.\nFAREWELL TO DREGS Hardbitten readers of this journal\nwi j.1 remember Hubert Edwin Smith, a brow hb agger who reformed late in his\nCollege career and was eventually\n\"profiled\" in Felix No, 98 This\nChristmas sees the departure from our\nmidst of Hubert's elder brother B. T.L. Smith - \"Dregs\" as he is known to us\nall. \"Dregs\" came to I.C. last year\nrather late in life (but very young in\nspirit) to do research in a specialised\nbranch of bio physical metallurgy in which he is reputed to be a World\nAuthority. This particular topic is the\nstudy of the influence of skin thickness and load distribution factor on\nmetal fatigue in the hobnails of the\nboots worn by lame c entire des. \"Dregs\"\nis reluctant to say whether the reason\nfor his departure is the completion of\nthe research or a cessation of his Air\nMinistry grant. Whatever the reason,\nhe will leave a large gap in our\nsociety.\nThere are those endearing \"Dregs\"\nmannerisms which have made their* mark\non certain sections of the Union: a modest and unassuming manner, unimpeachable gentility towards ladies, and\na down-to-earth manner of speech.\np Dregs\" has never been known to call\na spade a \"spade\"). These, combined\nwith a Mr. Punch - like profile and\nv ni que physique made him a certain\nchoice for President of R.C.S. had he\nbeen able to stay with us longer.\nA tribute such as this must not\nfail to make reference to the supreme\nability of B. T.L. Smith as a musician\nof the highest rank. He has his favourite trumpet which is seldom idle - to\nthe great entertainment of those who\nwould wish to be thought of as his\n\u2022friends. Mr. Editor of Felix must be\nwondering how he will be able to fill his columns after Christmas.\nStudents Temperance\nSociety,\nW.C. Dec. 7th. Dear Sir,\nMy attention has been drawn to the\nfact that it is planned to include in\nthe new I.C. Union building a room of\nconsiderable dimensions whose sole purpose is the sale of intoxication li qu ors, and the singing of songs of a nature such that most members of the\nCollege are rightly shocked by the low\nmoral standards displayed by the drunken\nparticipants.\nIt is well known that the incidence\nof drunkenness in the younger generation\nis increasing, and the corresponding\ndecline in moral standards is, I am\nsure, due to the disgusting habit of\nsome students (fortunately few) drinking\nthemselves insensible on every possible\noccasion.\nIs it not too late to have the plans\naltered and convert this room to some\nmore useful purpose such as for communal-hymn singing, or if this is impossible\nto limit the liquids sold to those of\nbeneficial nature such as milk and\norange juice.\nYours etc.,\nA. Charles\nNELSON'S COLUMN To begin on a serious note, Nelson,\non behalf of all our readers, extends\nhis best wishes for a speedy recovery\nto Peter Parsons (Zoology 3} I.C. is not\nthe same without \"Slasher\".\nCarnival time is here again and as\nusual, I.C. have risen to the occasion\nand the female population has correspond-ingly increased several hundred per cent\nin fact there appears to be more women\nthan men in reside no e: Post-Carnival couples, natural lv a little below par, emerging from the\nhostel oh that-morning-after-the-night\nbefore, were somewhat perturbed to see\na horse prancing around the quad.\nHowever, o loser inspection and the appearance of a bottle of brown ale from\nits stomach, revealed that it was human\nafter all. Beneath this equine guise\nwere two offshoots of the Mountaineering Club: Dick Wright (bearded front\nlegs) and Pete Smith (bearded back legs)\nAs they cantered precariously up the\nHostel steps they neighed something\nabout a Riding Club Hop.\nSociety's darling, debonair Mike\nNewson, was caught by a DAILY TELEGRAPH\nphotographer doing an eight some reel with the Queen Mother at the U.L. U. President's Ball recently. With characteristic modesty he was facing away\nfrom the camera at the time. We gather that it was an enjoyable affair\nfrom what he hiccoughed later at the\nCarnival, in between clarinet solos\nfrom a horizontal position on the floor.\nRumours, circulated by Mr. Leston,\nwell-known musician, composer, author,\nbug-catch-er and genius( as he modestly\nwill admit)that this issue was to be a Denis Leston Farewell Edition, are entirely without foundation.\nAnother rumour that has been spreading recently is that I.C. has a President\nand that he may appear in public soon.\nThis is no cause tc panic however, for rumours, like dart bt jard s, have a way of\ndisappearing into thin air. Before you JJ.1 3 ett le down to the\nserious business of celebrating, here is a letter from a previous Felix( December\n1956) which might interest you.\nThe most sign i gic ant thing there,\nit seems to me, is the W.C. We feel that we should apologise\nfor any in consist an sies in this issue.\nFor, with a make-up immediately after\nthe carnival, we did not get-*e bed get\nmuch sleep that weekend.\n\n"
