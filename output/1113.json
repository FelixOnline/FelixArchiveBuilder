    "content": "12 MUSIC 25 March1998 CLUBSCENE - ALBUMS, NEWS & REVIEWS\n! \\ J\\J el come back to\nJ\\/\\g a packed issue\nV V of Clubscene.\nThere is so much going on I 've\nchanged the set-up to fit more in.\nYou may have noticed that this\nis the year of the drum & bass\nalbum, where every label on the\nscene, even the most underground\nare working hard to get an album\nout. I 've noticed that a lot of vinyl\njunkies seem to steer away from\nbuying vinyl albums and would rather buy 12\" singles.\nIt's not that they are too expensive - \u00a3 1 5 . 0 0 , that's three singles\nand obviously far cheaper than buying the equivalent number of\nsingles. You normally get at least\nfour pieces of vinyl and with the\nquality of the albums at the\nmoment both sides are packed with\nshit-hot tunes.\nI think it's more to do with the\nimage of the album, I myself use to\nnot buy albums as I thought they\nweren't as good as singles for some\nstrange reason, but over recent\nCLUBSCENE - ALBUMS\nT he latest release in the now\nlegendary Logical Progression\nseries is a double CD comprising an intense live CD featuring\nthe one and only Mc Conrad & DRS\nby far the best Mc's on the planet\nand a second CD of Studio Exclusive\n(9 un-mixed previously unreleased\ntracks) chosen by the main man\nhimself LT] Bukem. Or for the DJs\nout there the triple vinyl is a absolute must if you can find it, you\nget 6 of the 9 Studio Exclusive that\nare on the CD. CD 1. Intense touch down with\nthe full live drum & bass experience\nand are joined by an all star cast gui-tar, bass, sax and drum players to\nproduce a sound that effortlessly\njumps from a live band in a jazz style\ntoo a more computer orientated\nrolling D&B sound. You can tell this is\nlive not only from the cheering\nyears this has changed and I 've\nsaved a fortune by buying albums\ninstead of just singles.\nSome that have already been\nreleased that are more than worthy\nof a mention are Enforcer Beginning\nBr The End 'R> inforced), a top class\nVp Bf raf ibn up there with the\nt mm\\ hit i&S \u00a3r Box Set, Renegade\nHardware Quantum Mechanics ruff\nas you like, Juice's more than adequate mini album and Ram's Moving Fusion compilation it's ruff,\ntough and dangerous. These are all\nout now and if you haven't checked\nthese out you'll be missing some of\nthe most important and innovative\nworks of the year so far.\nWith one eye on the future\nthere's even more to look forward\ntoo with albums from the one and\nonly LTJ Bukem and also from DJ\nKrust of the Represents massive,\nboth solo albums that I can't wait to\nhear Krust's album should be out\nJune-ish, and Buke ma little later in\nthe year. Also look out for\nFormations-World Cup 98 compi la crowds but also by the way the live\ninstrument players seem to get a bit\ncarried away at times. They have got\nthe length, and timing of the live\nbreaks just about spot on, as soon as\nI start thinking that Sax or what ever\nis getting a bit much it stops and\nyou're back to the smooth rolling\nbeats. Good Times Bad is I suppose\nas much a jazz track as D&B it's amazing how they create the D&B sound using what sounds like a mainly live band. With the vocal dexterity of Conrad and DRS (the Mc's with the most lyrics) are the icing on\nan already very sweet cake.\nCD2 Studio Exclusive.\nDisappointingly this CD isn't mixed\nbut that is where the disappointments stops. Nine shit-hot totally\noriginal deep melodic tracks from\nthe cream of Goodlookings artists:\nBlu Mar Ten, Blame, Tayla, Big Bud,\nArtemis, Seba and Bob Saundz. For\nthe vinyl lover the triple vinyl pack is\na must if you can hunt down a copy.\nThese tracks will not be released as\n12\" at all so miss these innovative\ncollection of tracks at your peril.\nAll in that typical GL style rolling\ndreamy breaks most are easily hard\nenough to work in the club en v iron ment. And unlike many tunes co ming out of GL these are quite easy to\nmix with they just roll into each\nother. Jo Public\ntion with tracks from all the major\nnations in the world cup. That is\ncoming out to coincide with the\nworld cup around June.\nO ver the Easter break it was\nnice to see The Ministry Of Sound putting on a decent\nnight for a change. Hold on! that's the second night that was worth\ngoing to this year what's going on. 1\nknow it's hard to believe but a couple of months ago Renaissance was\nin the house and a few weeks back\nthe Logical Progression crew\npassed through for one of there rare\nappearances. It was wicked to hear\nBukem play out again and Blame\nand Seba did their reputations no\nharm at all.\nBut this night did remind me\nwhy 1 hate the Ministry so much -with such hi end ly security, stupid\nrules and thi- place;'was just too\nrammed for most 1 should imagine,\nNothing like it was when they did\ntheir regular monthly nights down there last year. I hope they change\nAstralwerks. Various Artists\n(AstralWerks) \u2022\u2022\u20221/2\nThis is a collection from the\nAstralWerks label with tracks from\nWill Web, Aqua rhythms, Gearwhore, Q Burns, Space-time\nContinuum, and Freaky Charka. The\nstyles covered are soft techno too\ndeep tech-house sort of things.\nThere are a couple of weak tracks\nhere such as La La La that let the\ncompilation down a little but apart\nfrom this it's a OK selection of\ntripped out breaks 'n' beats.\nNinja Cut 3. Funkungfusion\n(Ninja) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA double CD boasting some 31 off-the-wall tracks - the best from the\nvast array of talent passing through\nthe Ninja camp. With tracks from\nsuch names as Chocolate Weasel,\nAmon Tobin, Kid Kola, The\nHerbalizer, Coldcut, DJ Vadim & DJ\nFood to mention but a few. This is\nnot really aimed at the die hard Ninja\nfan as they will already have most of\nthe tracks but a good introduction\nfor the uninitiated to the immense\ndiversity of sound that is Ninja.\nKing Kooba. The Imperial\nSolution. \u2022\u2022\u2022\nI expected this to be in a down beat\nstyle, but It's not it's nearly all drum\n& bass fairly melodic some tracks\nreminiscent of Nook ie's style.\nThere's also some harder drum &\nbass tracks here not really aimed at\nthe dancefloor but more deep m ov the venue for the next one when\never that is. Sticking with all things\nBukem if you haven't already you\nmust check his new EP and a most\nawesome mixed compilation\nProgression Sessions that shows\nhow a DJ should work it and with\nthe MC with the most lyrics Conrad\nit has to be the best thing I 've\nbrought this year.\nOn Saturday 9 May there's only\none place to be if your into the\nGarage scene as the originator and\nprobably the biggest Garage nights\nof the past years La Costa Nosta is\n@ Camden Palace for there 3rd Bday party featuring the cream of\nGarage DJs. Info/Tickets 0836 581\n728 Or 0 9 5 8 3 7 8 5 4 5 .\nFinally if you fancy reading a proper magazine, try Knowledge\nwith in-depth info on the D&B tSi ene, full colour an il it's still free\n\"s6 you' d better r tish down to your\nloc M' independent record shop as\nthey'll be gone in a flash.\nJo Public\ning tracks that you can just sit back\nand drift along too. I must warn you\nthat in the middle of this album it\ngoes a little strange with some\nfunky breakbeat jazzy laid back\ngrooves that I don't feel work that\nwell (tracks 5 & 6 ) after this it gets\nback to the inspired D&B numbers\nand finishes on a much better down\ntempo track.\nSadie Glutz. The Boy From Outer\nSpace. (Silver Planet) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis is the debut album from Sadie\nGlutz and it defies character is ation and can only be described as heavy\nsample based quality electronic\nmusic with influences from acid,\nhip-hop, breakbeat, hardcore and\nearlier techno. It goes in one direction that shoots off at tangents, you\nget the rough with the smooth. All\nin all a very complete album. Look\nout for there collaboration with\nColognes Air Liquid later in the year.\nFull Force mixed by Kenny Ken.\n(Most Wanted) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n28 tracks mainly big phat pieces of\nD&B seamless ly mixed together by\nthe nice guy of drum & bass.

    "content": "NEWS 1 May1998 A Mayor for London?\nYou Decide.\nJEREMY THOMSON\nThe whole of London will be\nasked to turn out to vote in a referendum this Thursday to answer\nthe question 'Are you in favour of\nforming Greater London\nAuthority, made up of an elected\nMayor and a separately elected\nAssembly?' If the vote is passed,\nwhich looks highly likely, London will have a powerful and unilateral\nbody consisting of a Mayor and 25\nofficers installed by 2000.\nThe mayor's office will be\nresponsible for overseeing the\npolice, transport and planning and\nwill coordinate the activities of the\nindividual boroughs. It will be able\nto launch cross-capital initiatives\nsuch a Riverbus service, which has\nnot been possible since the Greater\nLondon Council was abolished by\nMargaret Thatcher ten years ago.\nAlthough the government's full\nplans are not yet known, it is likely\nthat the mayor and his officers\nwould be elected seperate ly, probably on four-year terms. They\nwould have an estimated total budget \u00a33.2 billion, though expenditure may well be limited by\nWhitehall.\nThe political race to find can di dated for the position of mayor has\nalready started. Labour MPs and\nex-GLC members Ken Livingstone\nand Glenda Jackson have both\ndeclared their intention to stand,\nwith the strongly socialist Ken\nLivingstone winning public support,\nif not that of his own party. The\nConservative Party are also waiting\nbefore naming an official can di date, though possible future mayors include Chris Patten, Stephen\nNorris and Chris Smith. The tory\npeer, despot, author and charlatan\nJeffery Archer has also been highly\nvocal in his campaign to become\nthe mayor of London. However,\npublic opinion is against him and\nhe may withdraw if not selected as\nthe official Conservative candidate.\nSeveral independent candidates have also declared their\ninterest including Greg Dyke, former controller of TV AM and LWT\nand Howard Marks, former drug-baron turned protester. The pop u lar business tycoon Richard\nBranson is also highly favoured in\nopinion polls, but denies that he\nwill stand due to vested interests.\nThe vote will take place from\n8 am9 pm Thursday 7 May, and\neveryone currently resident in\nLondon, including all students in\ncollege halls, is e legible to poll.\nResidents of Southside Hall can\ncollect their voting cards from the\nmail racks in the security lodge. For\nmore information, call the official\nhelpline on 0 8 4 5 607 0598.\nfrom front page\nexplained staff have to come to\nterms with a new integrated curriculum as well as the new multidisciplinary laboratories and the\nopen-plan offices. There will be a lack of time for adequate training\nof staff, exp lined Prof Edwards, and\nand many of them will be forced to\nreorganise their holiday if the delay\nis accepted. He stated that they\nwere \"still trying to place pressure\"\non Schal to honour their current\nagreements.\nThe Director of estates, Ian\nCaldwell was focussed on \"trying\nto minimise the impact on staff\"\nand felt the solution lay in \"looking\nat contingencies\". He took a positive point of view saying \" When it's finished it will be a stunning build-ing\", but was reluctant to comment\non the performance of Schal or the\npenalties they may face.\nNews in Brief...\nASBESTOS CLAIM\nCOST \u00a3150,000\nImperial has found itself\n\u00a3 150,000 out of pocket, after settling out of court with the widow of James Lewis, a former lecturer\nat Imperial killed by an asbestos\nrelated disease.\nMrs Lewis claimed that her\nhusband died as a result of years\nof exposure to asbestos in work-shops, where asbestos was being\ncut up for use in lagging lab\nequipment. Mr Lewis died of the\nlung condition mesothelioma five\nyears after taking early retirement\nin 1988, at the age of 57, having\nlectured in Mechanical Engineering for thirty years.\nThe case had the backing of\nthe largest higher education union, the Association of\nUniversity Teachers, who had\nfunded the expensive legal battle.\nThe AUT welcomed the outcome,\nsaying that the case raised concerns over how many teachers\nand students might still go on to\ndevelop asbestos related illness-es. Mrs Lewis also drew attention\nto the wider-scale implications of\nthe continuing use of asbestos,\n\"Jim was adamant that the case\nshould be pursued, as asbestos\nwas in such common use without\nthe public being aware how it\ncould devastate lives.\" The use of\nasbestos in universities is still legal\nin some cases, and the AUT are\ncalling for a change in the law to\nban the potentially fatal insulator.\nMAKE-OVER FOR\nGREAT HALL\nPlans were unveiled this week for\na thorough refurbishment of the\nGreat Hall, projected to take place\nthis summer. The overhaul, which\nis designed to fulfill the needs of\nthe Conference Center, has a projected cost of \u00a3 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 and will\ninclude obtaining a full Public\nEntertainments License.\nThe plan, which still requires\nfinal approval from the College\nBuildings Committee, is based\naround replacing the first six rows\nof fixed seating with electronically\ncontrolled retractable seating, in\nthe style of those proposed for\nWembley Stadium. Similarly, the\nfront of the stage would retract\nunder the remaining fixed stage,\nto give an overall increase in floor\nspace of 30%.\nAdditionally, a large sum is set\naside for giving the Great Hall a facelift, and improve acoustics.\nAlthough the timber cladding will\nremain, the plans promise \"tex-tu red plastered finish, coloured to\naid orientation\" and \"polished\nplaster to give greater visual clar i ty\". This will apparently ensure\nthat \"quality materials ... will give\nan indication of the environment\nthat will be expected within the\nHall\". Overhaul of toilet and\nemergency provision should\nensure that the venue receives the\nents license which the Conference\nCenter see as vital to their plans\nto develop Sherfield as a prime\nCentral London conference\nvenue.\nA final decision must be made\nby II May, and if the plan gets\nthe go ahead work should be\ncompleted by 1 October this year.\nIMPERIAL STEALS\nSECOND PLACE\nAccording to the latest survey by\nthe Financial Times, Imperial\nCollege has now overtaken\nOxford University to become the\nsecond best higher education\ninstitution in the UK.\nThe favorable grading recieved\nby IC is due largely to its high\nstaff-student ratio and its ability\nto attract research funds - an\naverage of \u00a3 3 9 , 2 6 0 per\nresearcher, nearly \u00a3 6 0 0 0 higher\nthan Oxford. My students \"are no smarter\nthan those at Oxford and\nCambridge, they are meaner and\nleaner\", claimed Rector Sir Ronald\nOxburgh. In reality, the escalation\nfrom third to second place may\nhave more to do with statistical\ndifferences between the Financial\nTimes study and the industry-standard Times annual survey,\nwhich places higher weighting on\nfactors such as student accommodation.

    "content": "22\nAN ORGASMIC REVIEW OF STUNNING BEAUTY\nARTS 1 May1998 LOVECRAFT\nSouth London Gallery\nTrains potters. Loads of 'em. At\nleast ten. Maybe twenty.\nAnoraks; thermos; dicta phones; binoculars; night sights. They mean business.\nThey can't see me. I'm on top of\nthe ga so meter at King's Cross,\nlooking down towards the platforms of St. Pancras. Their faces\nlook big and sweaty through the\nrifle sight. They dodge in and out of\nthe cross-hair. They don't acknowledge each other and they don't talk, except when a train heaves\ninto view. \"43012, 9 9 8 7 , 9982,...\" -I can hear their ya b bering through a radio mic I taped to the signal post.\nIt's a lovely weekend to be stalking\na bunch of trains potters. Later in the week, 1 find myself\nin the middle of 'Lovecraft' at the\nSouth London Gallery, standing in\nfront of a video installation called\n'Battle Sounds' by Carluccio 8.\nValledor. The video purports to be\na facto-rockumentary about DJ-ing\ntechniques.\nWe see D] Jazzie Jay drop a needle onto a record. DJ Jazzie\nspends the best part of four minutes explaining why his particular\nneedle drop is worshipped and\nadored amongst the needle-drop-ping community. The explanation\ntakes place in considerable detail. I close my eyes as Jazzie moves\nfrom emphasising the importance\nof a clean lift to expounding the\nvirtues of a tightly controlled flight.\nI picture a herd of about twenty\nJazzie Jays huddled round a record-deck, each with anorak and ther-mos, dodging in and out of the\ncross-hair...\nLater, someone approaches the\nfront desk, and clearly impressed\nby the content of the video they ask\nif there are any copies on sale. I move further into the gallery.\nMartin Creed has installed two\nbreast-like protrusions on a gallery\nwall. The installation has clearly\nundergone an obsessive period of\nperfection so that the join between\nprotrusion and wall is invisible, and\nthe texture and colour of the protrusions matches that of the surrounding wall exactly. I come to the\nconclusion that the piece must\nhave been executed by licking away\nthe surrounding wall. Picture it. The\ndedicated artist licking away at an\nenormous pair of smooth white\nbreasts as they emerge from a previously flat expanse of matt white\nALL THOSE THINGS I COULDN'T FIT IN ANYWHERE ELSE\nANTE ROOM GALLERY\nAnother term, another exhibition in\nthe Ante Room,\" Campus\". As you might expect from the title, it's photographs of Imperial. They're\ngood, very good, I just kept on expecting to see a sign saying\n\"Welcome to Imperial College, for\nall your confer ance needs.\" It's very tasteful and grown up, but it\nisn't art. it doesn't promote any\nemotions at all. There isn't all that\nmuch to say about it really.\nWHO ARE BIB AND BOB?\nI don't normally do this, ie b latent ly plug other peoples' shows, but\nas 1 was on the guest list for the\nfirst night, what the hell. Jerry\nSadowitz, the well known Channel\n5 comedian, and Logan Murray are\nin an outrageous show of inimitable\ncomic genius at the Critereon\nTheatre. Called \"Bib and Bob\", it's apparently extremely puerile and\nfunny, and would be appreciated\nby students of all ages. Tickets are\n\u00a3 1 0 , and the show runs until the\n7th of May. It's a late night,\n(10.30pm) X rated, seriously rude\nshow. Or so the press release says,\nanyway.\nPICASSO - SCULPTOR\nAND PAINTER IN CLAY\nAdvance warning to all fans of\nPicasso: start saving now. The\nRoyal Academy of Arts will be\nemulsion.\nFurther on, Lolly Batty gives us\na4 foot wide, matt-white, 3-dimensional Ninja star called\n'Arabesque1\n. Its form is deeply sat-is f ying. It seems to represent the\npinnacle of shape, a shining orgasm\nof perfect geometry in a world of\npragmatism and compromise. There's no way that this could have\nbeen hewn or assembled. It must\nbe an egg of some sort, the product of a lengthy period of gestation\nwhich culminated in the simultaneous emergence of the object and\nmessy destruction of the artist.\nJeff Luke presents us with a table crammed with 'Various\nObjects' - books, ornaments,\ncrockery. The objects have been\nencased in elastic bands. Each\nobject is wrapped to a strict pattern using bands of a single width. I imagine how Jeff Luke might have\nspent an evening in with a few\nfriends, wrapping the objects.\n'You've gone over before coming\nunder, it should be the other way\nround\", says Luke. \"Sorry\", says\nMardis-Gras bomber.\nYou get the point. These are\nseriously obsessive works of art by\nseriously obsessive people. Indeed,\nthat's the whole point of 'Lovecraft'\n- why are the most creative, most\nresonant works of genius born of\nan obsession that verges on\nautism? Why do artists insist on\nexisting in this narrow strip of land\nbetween mediocrity and madness?\nTake an anorak - that way,\nthey'll suspect nothing.\njon Jansen\nexhibiting some of his little known\nceramics in September, and they\nare so good, you will want to go at\nleast twice. Ranging from vases\nshaped like birds to plates with fish\nmoulded onto them to giant fig-ure s, the exhibition is a comprehensive show of his work in clay.\nMany of the items were donated by\nthe family, and have never been\nseen before. Anyone with an interest in Picasso must go, as the work\nis truely stunning. I was lucky\nenough to go to the Press confer-ance about it, and I 've seen some\nof the exhibits. Even if you're not a massive Picasso fan, they are well\nworth seeing. Watch this space for\nmore details.\nAND FINALLY.\nDram soc are performing Alan\nAckbourn's\" A Chorus of\nDisapproval\" in the sixth week of\nterm. The play is extremely good, and tells the story of an amateur\noperatic group, and the various trials and tribulations. I 've heard that\nthe set is magnificent, and I'm sure\nthe acting will be too. Not so sure\nabout some of the accents\nthough....\nArts Ed\n\n"

As near to the\nperfect as you're likely to get.\nThe sound system is the loudest 1 have every heard and crystal\nclear with it, it's not that surprising\nas Eskimo Noise supply the system.\nWe were sitting on the balcony as far\naway from the\nspeakers as you can get and you could still feel the\npressure vibrating\nparts that others\ncan't reach.\nYou can expect to hear the best DJs in the\nbusiness the first night we went\ndown there we heard Digital who played an awesome set, Randall\nwho rinsed the place as usual and finally Fabio rolled the night to an\nend. Three different styles not what\nI was expecting but a pleasant surprise as all styles were covered the\nway I like it.\nThe next month I was there\nagain this to hear Kemistry &.\nStorm, JJ Frost fresh back from the\nUSA and finally Doc Scott. Yes this\nnight is so good since I went the\nfirst time a few months back I 've\nback every month and I 'll be there\ntonight too fir J MaJika.Ray Keith,\nFabio &. Doc Scott.\nThe lighting is also shit-hot as\nyou might expect adding that little\nbit extra, especially with the way they build with the music to add to\nthe atmosphere. I must mention\nthe misting machine they have here\nit's wicked no sticky throat drying\nsmoke but a fine mist is sprayed at\nhigh pressure from a tube that runs\nthe length of the ceiling that also\nacts as a refreshing cool breeze as\nit comes out with such velocity. It's the little things like this that make\nall the difference from being an\nalright night to a wicked night.\nNice to see Goldie bowling\nabout the place as well, it must be\na top buzz being the man behind\nsuch a spot on night.\nThe only down-side begin that it\nis a little expensive to get in - \u00a3 15\n(but that's only 5 0 pa day) drinks\naren't cheap \u00a3 3 . 5 0 a bottle of beer\nand I advise you to arrive early as\nthis night often gets roadblocked.\nYou won't find many piss heads in\nthe place and you only get people\nthere who really want to be there\nno attitude just people that like\ntheir music real.\nDon't forget that you can catch\nGoldie n' crew down the Bluenote\neach and every Sunday if once a month isn't enough for ya and it's a little cheaper.\nJo Public\nCLUBSCENE - SINGLES\nWX\\'A:\\! Sniper. Cross fader Dominator\n(Bullion Rec)\nThis has been receiving rave\nreviews from a number of big name\nDJs in the big beat area and seems\nto be set for great things. It's a hard\nmix of breaks, beats &. some fucked\nup guitar business that all sounds\nall right in a hard busting sort of\nway. This is a good track but I'm not sure if it justifies all the hype.\nFreddy Fresh. Down For The Count\nEP (Eye Q) Freddy keeping it fresh with another funky selection of doped up\nbeats ' n' breaks. Plenty of scratch-ing, spin backs and general\nturntable tomfoolery. If you missed the scratch mix supremo Essential mix on radio I where he\nsqueezed in over 100 tunes, don't be too up set as he's back on our\nside of the pond the first two weeks\nof May, playing amongst others at\nThe End, WC1 and Cream-Fields.\nSkylab. Magenta EP (Eye Q) Three tracks, the first sounding like\na mix of thrash metal guitar with\ndowntempo beats and a weird\nfemale vocal. The brave, second is\ntotally opposite slow-paced serene\ntrack with beautiful dream female\nvocal. The third track Bite This is a super edit of the hard to find 7\"\nfrom 97.\nEskovah. Come To Me/ Long Time\nSmoker (Colorstone)\nBack to a similar style to their first\nrelease of a large-ish female vocal\nwith tough ' n' quite dark beats. Few\ndo this as well as Eskovah and I 've\nbeen playing this one to death.\nOnce you've caned this side you can turn it over and get stuck into\nthe flipside which is just as good.] Raq. Waff 4 the bass / Molecule\n(Fullcyde)\nA massive track that's been rinsed\nall over the place. Rolling-stepping\n'n' building beats in that Fullcycle\nstyle but it's still as individual a track as your likely to find. Double\nbass runs alongside a clever flexed\nsub-bass and plenty of fx and little\nnoises to keep you interested.\nBlu Mar Ten. Butterflies & Moths\n(720)\nAnother skippy dreamy summer afternoon of a track from Blu Mar Ten rapidly establishing himself\nwith the GL camp. Strong atmospheric als as you would expected\nchopped up beats and a subtle\nbassline. Firm favourite with the\nlikes of Blame Fabio.\nColdie. Believe (Metalheadz)\nGrooverider does a superb job on the remix and I wouldn't be without\nit. It starts out in a deep intelligent\nstyle and then after the breakdown\nthe style is totally changed to a phat b line monster transforming\nthe track.\nSerious Danger. High Noon\n(Fresh Rec)\nStrong western tendencies ride\nalongside those speed sort of style\nbeats, rag ga lyrics, gun shoots and phat rolling sub bass. That sounds\nslightly dated now.3 different\nmixes using different bass lines and a previously unreleased vocal mix\nof Deeper thrown in to the bargain.\nC Flame & Mr.G. The stylus EP\n(Metalbox)\nThis double vinyl pack is just what\nI'd been waiting for, as I like to play\nprogressive sets from garage too\nbanging house. These are great\nbridging tunes they fit neatly\nbetween different styles / tempos\nof tracks. Added bonus there are no\nlyrics so you can roll it in behind\nheavy vocal numbers with out having to worry about vocals over\nvocals. All have a deep US house\nfeel, full marks for originality.\nRay Hurley feat Donna\nCousinson. Just Yourself\n(Confetti)\nVocal &. dub mixes nice vocal, distinct voice that sounds a little\nstrange at first but definitely grows\non ya over time. Well ahead of it's time as already been out for a few\nmonths now but sounds bang up to\ndate. The voice complements the\nkey changes very nicely and xylophone that comes in after the first\nbreak is just what it needed to keep\nit going wicked little track.\nEquator. Silence (Bosca Beats)\nHard house at it's best, with building filtered horns and beats to\nmatch, a uplifting yet moody feel to\nit. I heard this played out a few\nweeks back and the place went bal-list ic. Mad ley gets on the mix on\nthe flipside taking it off in a different direction with a spacey tinge,\nboth work equally well massive\ntune.\nLectrolux. Mind The Gap (TEC)\nI'd call this tech-house, tough beats\ngo at a fierce pace, touches of acid\nkeep it in a hard style. After the\nbreak it comes back even harder\nthan before and getting more acidic\nas it progresses and if this isn't quite what you wanted you also get\nremixes from Commander Tom and Knukleheads so if there should be\nsomething for all house fans.\nBlu Peter. Tell Me What You Want\n(React)\nBlu Peter &. React you should know\nwhat to expect a first class bang-ing/tech-house track, with strong\nacidic overtones. Flipside starts out\nsounding like a drum &. bass track\nand somehow ends up as a full on\nbanging house track very clever,\nand just what I needed a D8J5house cross over track.\nJo Public\n\n"

While its\nprobably a bit premature to start\nfeeling victimised when you're\nforced to wait for a bus half an hour\nin the rain, Bobby Cooper( Sean\nPenn) can be forgiven for feeling\nparanoid.\nOn his way to clear his gam bling debts to a particularly vicious\nbunch of Russian gangsters, his car\nbreaks down close to the tiny town of Superior, Arizona. Any hope he\nhad of making his appointment in\ntime is crushed by an obstructive\nmechanic (Hollywood flavour-of-the-month Billy Bob Thornton)\nwho, in time honoured fashion,\ndoesn't have the right parts to\nmake a repair. Forced to spend\nsome time in town, it isn't long\nbefore Bobby encounters some of\nthe locals, all of whom seem curiously familiar.\nFrom the Patsy Cline loving\ntrailer trash and the world weary\nsheriff to the old man, played by\nHaving re-defined the horror genre\nlast year with Scream, Wes craven\nreturns to give the horror sequel a damn good kicking, with Scream 2\nreleased today. With Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox returning to star, it promises the same\nwinning blend of knowing irony and\nscares that made the first film so\nsuccessful. [A full review will\nappear next week]\nThanks to those wonderful people at the Odeon Kensington, we give you the chance to catch this\nmust-see without spending so\nmuch as a penny. As well as tickets\nfor the film, the five prize-winners\nwill also collect a copy of the\nsoundtrack, and a limited edition t shirt.\nFor your chance to pick up this\nJon Voight, offering sage yet\noblique advice, Superior has the full\ncompliment of the usual cinematic\ninhabitants of a sleepy desert town.\nSome of these caricatures, how ev er, reveal a sinister side as Bobby\nbecomes involved in the tale of\ndeceit and double crossing at the\nheart of this tense atmospheric\nfilm.\nOliver Stone's vivid style\ndeflects attention from his lack of\nsubtlety, and, along with some great performances, makes for\nstriking viewing. Q Simon\nbag of goodies, simply tell us:\nWhich other Kevin\nWilliamson penned horror flick is\ndue for a sequel later this year?\nTo enter simply email your\nanswer to film.felix@ic.ac.uk,\nbefore Monday evening.\nWe also have 100 copies of a Jackie Brown CD to give away,\nincluding soundtrack excerpts, an\ninterview with Tarantino and some\nvideo clips. Just drop into the Felix\noffice and ask sweetly.\nThe answers to last term's final\nposers were: DeCaprio and Winslet\nstar in Titanic; and Samuel L Jackson played Jules in Pulp Fiction.\nGREAT H EXPECTATIONS\nStarring: Gwyneth Paltrow, Ethan\nHawke, Anne Bancroft, Robert De\nNiro\nDirector: Alfonso Cuaron\nT here were certainly great\nexpectations for this film in\nthe industry. It was due for a US release in December so it\nwould have a shot at the Oscars,\nbut was pulled at the last minute\nas the producers suddenly realised\nthat the chance of this winning a statuette is zilch.\nThe idea of a contemporary\nsetting for Dicken's classic is certainly not a bad one and the first\nhalf of the film is promising. At the\ncentre of the story is Ethan\nHawke, a man whose life is dominated by one ambition; to wed and bed childhood sweetheart\nGwyneth Paltrow. It's not a senseless ambition, obviously, but\nPaltrow is one of those annoyingly\nicy women who always flirt but\nnever commit themselves.\nWe follow Hawke's life as he\nbecomes an established\nManhattan artist due, in part, to a mysterious benefactor who may or\nmay not be Paltrow'shagged old\naunt played by Anne Bancroft. No matter how successful he is, how-ever, Hawke knows he will never\nbe truly happy until Paltrow is his\nfor good. Unlike in the novel, acclaimed\ndirector Alfonso Cuaron focuses\nentirely on the relationship\nbetween the two main characters.\nHis Great Expectations is first and\nforemost a love story, with colourful characters played by a solid\ncast .which includes a superb\ncameo by De Niro as Lustig\n(Magwitch in the novel). The let-down is that he doesn't keep the\nmomentum of the first half going\nand ends up with amish mash of\nscenes which don't fit together\nwell. This is compounded at a time when the story should be\ncoming to an intriguing finale by\ngiving Hawke that appalling line,\n\"Everything I do, Ido it for you.\" All in all, this is a more than\nadequate love story which, despite the change of setting, still\nretains some of the magic of\nDicken's' original. The attitude of\nthe director to his adaptation,\nhowever, is made entirely clear\nwhen he explains, \"I would have\nchanged the title but I couldn't think of anything better.\" Of\nChris\nTickets fk prizes galore courtesy of\nKENSINGTON\n\n"

    "content": "1 May1998 MUSIC\nALBUMS\nCECIL\nSubtitles \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\"Are You looking at\nme? Well, are ya?!\"\nI'm a great fan of judging an album by its cover and\nhave been known to purchase them on the strength\nof the artwork. Subtitles looked like a gem. It's got\nthe band walking across a wide open space with a ray\nof light streaking through them casting long shadows\nand an empty glass case catching their reflection. I was\nready for an intelligent album with thought-provoking\nlyrics encased in wonderfully melodic bodies. Is that\ntoo much to ask in this day arid age?\nProbably. As you may have guessed, Cecil did not\nturn out to be the find of the year. Great expectations\ncome before a fall, or something like that, anyway.\nHowever, I was impressed; not overwhelmed, just\nimpressed. Full Stop is great single material. It's probably the most coherent lyrically but it's the quick\nacoustic strumming rhythm creating a sense of panic\nand urgency that fixes this track into your memory.\nLarger than a Mountain to the Ant and The Most Tiring\nDay are also memorable and demonstrate much of\nwhat is good about Cecil. At times they are able to\npaint some brilliant lyrical imagery and wrap it inside a unique yet familiar sound.\nEven so, most of the time the songs fall short of the\nmark. This is disappointing as the signs are there for\nCecil to release an inspirational album. Lock them in a studio with various instruments and a good producer\nand with time you'll be sure of a great album. In\ntoday's impatient climate, though, people want results\nnow and are not prepared to wait for things to blossom. Like subtitles themselves, the beauty can be lost\nin translation. Perhaps their next album will see them\nfinding their own personal sonic language that we, the\nconsumer, can enjoy without having to resort to listening to Subtitles. El Dennis.\nIMAN I COPPOLA\nChupacabra \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nI mani Coppola is an angelic\nfaced chant euse, with a touch\nof the bizarre about her. Her\ndebut single, Legend of a Cowgirl,\nis a cheerful song about a female\nlegend with a song, who's gonna\npack her bags and mount her\nhorse, and ride on into the next\ntown, and it went quite high in the\ncharts. It's a good sample of her\nwork, which is bizarre rap, with\nstrangely pertinent lyrics. Her latest single, I'm a Tree, is about her\nbeing a tree in the city, and needing somewhere to live, and how a tree seems out of place in a city.\nTrue. I think that it's really about\nisolation, but correct me if I'm wrong. You may have caught Imani\nsinging on jools Holland on Friday\nnight, in a bright green wig, with\nhair-slides with daises on. She was\nalso playing an extremely cool\nelectric violin. If you did, you'll\nhave a good idea of what the\nwhole album is like. The album is\nvery good, very funny, and interesting to listen to. There's a hidden\ntrack at the end, which is of such\nstunning beauty that it is worth\nbuying for that song alone. Overall,\nfor its sheer weirdness, cheerfulness and bouncy pop-i ness, this is\ngreat fun to listen to, and should\nbe bought by weird, cheerful and\nbouncy pop kids. Julia\nm SINGLES\nSister Hazel - All For You\nA memorable sing-along of the much-loved\nlong-haired American rock ballad variety. This is\nalready an anthem in America, if the crowd chanting in the live version is anything to go by.\nLower - Crime Satellite\nThis is what used to be called a well-crafted\nsong. It is along the traditional indie path but\nfilled with wonderful sonic pulses and blips, and\nsung by a sober follower of Julian Cope. Umajets - Half Man Half Wrecking Ball\nThis song begins by imitating Manic Street\nPreachers, right down to the angry vocals, but it\nsoon melts away into innocent soft rock terri to ry. Added hippie flourishes might appeal to\nLemonheads fans.\nWireless - Banana Tea\nSimply wonderful tune along the lines of\nLightning Seeds' \"perfect 3-minute pop songs.\"\nThe lyric tells the story of every monkey's plight\nof being forced to eat bananas and, erm,\nappear in tea commercials in unfashionable\nclothes. Top tune, though. Honest.\nThe Dandy Warhols;\nNot junkies, then.\nThe Dandy Warhols - Not If You Were The Last\nJunkie On Earth\nYou've probably made your mind up about this\nsong by now, due to its sumo sized airplay on\nthe radio. Either it's excellent, and sums up pre-millennial tension in 3 minutes of raw post-grunge pseudo pop. Or its a depressing drag\nthrough the group's twisted beliefs that the only\nreason not to take heroin is because it's just not\ncool, man.\nPenthouse - Remix E.P. Lots of angry shouting and repetitive trumpets\ncling on to the Lo-Fidelity All-Stars manic beats\nin the leading track White Coal. Elsewhere, Kris\nNeeds' chunky remix disrupts the Hawaiian\ntranquillity of Voyeur's Blues. Makes you wo nder what the original tracks sounded like.\nSatellite Beach - Psycho\nThis debut single starts with some rocky Fifties\nDoo Wop before giving way to Bowie-style\nglam-rock with a repeated cry of \"You're such a psycho!\" A very promising start.

    "content": "8 COLUMNS 1 May 1998\nTHOUGHT FOR THE DAY\n\"Turn over and start, good luck.\"\nIt's that time of year once\nmore. Sales of purple and\norange pens rocket; Helix\nshares double in value as sales of\ntransparent pencil cases and\ntwenty centimetre rulers grow\nseemingly without limit. Other\nbrands affected by this bizarre\nchange in spending patterns\ninclude reduced sales of Malboro\nLights (everyone switches to\nReds), Kenco seeing a dramatic\nseasonal upturn, and that bitter-tasting stuff that stops you from\nbiting your nails suddenly beginning to shift a lot of units. I imagine that campus drug dealers are\nalso smiling at this point in time,\nand waddling down to the bank to\ncash their ill-gotten gains. What,\nthen, causes this freak economic\nevent? Is it the heat? People\npreparing for holidays? A sudden\nC|D epidemic? Not bloody likely.\nThe reality is much more\nunpleasant.\nWhen I, with considerable trepidation, embarked upon my GCSEs\n(the certificates for which may be\nreadily purchased in joke shops\nthese days, just next to the\nwhoopee cushions; cheers,\nWestminster), my mother presented me with a book, written by a psychologist, detailing all the key\npoints required for structured and\nsensible revision. I read this tome\ncarefully (it was more interesting\nthan learning German). Inevitably, I subsequently ignored every piece\nof advice contained therein, preferring to cram entire subjects during\nweekend orgies of absorption (in\nthe case of Economics) or did absolutely nothing (rest of sub-j ect s). Does this sound familiar?\nNo? Methinks you doth talk from\nwithin your backside too much. Due to my unshakeable belief in\nthe old saying, \"If it ain't broke,\ndon't fix it\", this is, of course, the\nmethod of achieving academic nirvana that I have adopted ever since\n(although, if Iam completely hon-est, it was more to do with my faith\nin another old saying, \"Beer tastes\nbetter than notes\"). It is for this reason that the two weeks before any\nmajor exam I take are spent in a paranoid, neurotic, cancer-in duc ing, lip-biting frenzy of worry. (Still\nnot work, you'll notice. I don't actually start that until a maximum of thirty-six hours before an exam).\nNo, I thrive by spending my time\nworrying about not having done\nany work. Then comes Judgement\nDay; no mere pieces of A4 since\nNewton's Principia Mathematica\nhave had the potential to cause\nsuch permanent and irreversible\nbrain damage to a student.\nSo in you go, usually forgetting\nsomething important (witness a friend of mine who happily strolled\ninto his GCSE Physics exam without\na calculator and had to ask the\nInvigilator for log tables). The suspense is dreadful, but everyone\nelse seems calm and collected.\nThey also do not show even the\nslightest sign of needing the bipolar\ntransistor formulae that you have\nhurriedly scrawled on the back of\nyour hand, and are now desperately trying to keep clandestine.\nWhen the papers are turned\nover, my advice is as follows: step\none, try not to panic. This is not\nbecause it will distort your thought\nprocesses, but because the sweat\npouring down your forearm will\ndrench the answer booklet and\nconvert anything you actually do\nwrite into an insane three-year\nold's drawing of a dog. Step two is to try to keep your\nheartbeat down below the one\nhundred decibel mark, because\npressure fluctuations greater than\nthis may blow everything off your\nexam desk. Step three is to read\nthe question. Funnily enough, this\nis the most difficult part of the\nexam. I have been known to write\nsix hundred word answers to questions only to find upon finishing\nthat an evil poltergeist has modified the question while 1 was not\nlooking at it.\nOh, and when you have finished the ordeal, 1 advise that you\ndrink so much that you are sick.\nScientists would almost certainly\nargue against this behaviour, rec-om mending a decent meal and a good night's sleep. But, as we all\nknow, scientists have a habit of\ntalking rubbish. After all, you probably just wrote two thousand words\nof it.\nAll Campbell\nWater\nHoumous\nNow that the summer has come and pissing\nrain and cold are fading memories I thought I'd share a light and refreshing bijou x recipe-et te with you. Hou mou s is a spread based on chickpeas from the eastern mediterranean which is\nwell worth experimenting with. It's also excellent nutritionally with plenty of roughage to\nkeep you going. You will need:\n4\" 250 g dry chickpeas\n4\" 3 t bl tahini (pulped\nsea same seeds)\n4\" juice of Vz lemon\nT3 cloves garlic\n\u00ae\" salt and pepper\n4\" a mixing/mashing/\nblending/b zzz machine\nBriefly rinse your chickpeas under running\nwater. Leave them to soak in plenty of water\n(they will at least triple in size) for around a day.\nDrain and rinse again. Put the peas in a large\npan, fill the pan with water and put on a low\nheat without any salt. The chickpeas will take\nabout 2-3 hours to cook thoroughly so find a Rembrand's famous painting Aristotle contemplating the bust of Homer, the ancient\ngreek author famous for writing The\nOdessey and for inventing Homous. Er...\nhold on a minute...\nbook and watch out that they don't boil dry or\nyou'll end up with a layer of beautifully arranged\nlittle balls of carbon and a horrible smell (I do it\nall the time). You can speed up the cooking by\nadding a teaspoon or so of bicarbonate of soda\nat the beginning. Please do not be tempted to\nuse tinned chickpeas. You would be badly disappointed and better off just staying in bed.\nWhen the chickpeas are cooked there should be\njust enough liquid to cover them but no more.\nPlace the cooked chickpeas with their\nliqueur in the operating bit of your machine,\nadd the rest of the ingredients and give it a right\nold b zzz ing. You can add optional extras like\nchill is, parsley, spring onions or whatever at this\nstage. Make sure you check the seasoning,\nyou'll probably find you've underestimated the\nsalt but don't let that get you down. If you can't get tahini which is a semi-liquid\npaste made from pulped sesame seeds use\nsesame oil instead but it is available in quite a few grocery type shops. Scrumptious on toast.\nAntoine\nDon't despair, Westminster Eye will return\nin two week's time. Hamish Common is currently undergoing torture. (Exams).\n\n"

    "content": "May 1998 ARTS\nLOVE, SEX, INTELLIGENCE\nTHE INVENTION OF LOVE\nLyttleton Theatre, National Theatre\nG ive me a thousand kisses,\nand then a hundred more,\nand then another thousand\nand add five score....\nWhen was love invented? Who invented the love poem? Was it\nCatullus, as shown above? Or was\nsome unknown poet whose immortal lines of love have been lost in\ntime?\nWhoever it was, the play, the\nInvention of Love, has little to do with them. This is the new Tom Stoppard play, and like all of his\nwork, it is of stunning brilliance,\nand shows great wit and comp as sion. The play charts the story of A E Housman, a scholar and a gentle-men, through his time at Oxford, to\nhis failure to complete his degree,\nto his life in the gutter as a clerk at\nthe patent office, through his love\nfor Moses Jackson, through his professorships at UCL and Cambridge,\npast his death to him waiting for\nCharon's ferry, waiting to pass into\nthe Underworld, ready to meet the\npoets and writers he, as a classicist, has admired all his life. The\nplay is both tragic and comic; tragic because Housman' s love for\nJackson must always remain pla-tonic, comic because Tom Stoppard is a very funny writer.\nOne of the quotes he uses is\nfrom Horace, who dreams that he\npursued the fair Ligurinus across\nthe Field of Mars, and into the ever-flowing waters of the Tiber and\nspeaks of his love, and how he\nwould gladly lay down his life for\nhis love. This analogy is particularly\napt, as Moses Jackson was a sporty\nyoung man, a rowing Blue and a runner.\nOf course, at the time in which\nHousman lived, homosexuality was\na crime, punishable by many years\nin jail, as Oscar Wilde found out to\nhis cost. Oxford was a hot-bed of\ncloset homosexuals, all of whom dared not speak out for fear. This\ncontrasts strongly with the Ancient\nWorld, where love between men\nwas seen as the only pure love, and\nlove for women was regarded as\nsomewhat sordid, practical and\nun aesthetic. Men were encouraged\nby writers, poets and philosophers\nto take beautiful young boys as\nlovers, and many boys saw this as a career move. Aristophanes used\nthe idea of a ridiculous old man\npampering a pouting boy to represent the way the populous are\nfooled by politicians. Juvenal wrote\nan ode to boys' bottoms, and stated that \"If you must shorten your\nlife with sexual pleasures, take it\nwith a boy, not a woman.\" Imagine\nthe contrast between this and the\nheavily repressive Victorian and\nEdwardian eras, and its' effects on the troubled academics.\nHousman studied love in his\nessays, and in his poems, particularly A Shropshire Lad, and dedicated his life to his work, after realising the hopelessness of his love for\nMoses Jackson.\nThis is a very good play. Tom Stoppard writes with fluency and\nbrilliance, and all his characters are\nbelievable. Obviously, to fully\nunderstand all the literary allusions,\none needs to have studied Classical\nLiterature to a high degree, which I haven'td one but I still really\nenjoyed it. One of my best friends,\nwho is reading Classics at universi-ty, didn't understand all the refer-en ces, and she enjoyed herself, so\nI'm sure that you will too. It is witty,\ncompassionate and talks sense\nabout the hopelessness of unrequited love. If you only manage to\nsee one play this year, make it this\none.\nJulia H SLEEPING AROUND\nDonmar Warehouse\nSleeping Around is a collaboration between four of\nBritain's young, modern play-wrights, Mark Ravenhill, Abi Morgan, Hilary Fannin and Stephen\nGreenhorn, who originate from England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland respectively. This play,\npresented in a five night run at the\nDonmar Warehouse at the end of\nlast term, took the form of a sexual relay composed of a sequence of\nshort, dynamic scenes, each of\nwhich portrays a different aspect of\nthe relationships between men and\nwomen. The scenes, set in entirely unrelated locations, contained no continuation other than the presence\nin each of a character met in the\nprevious scene. The \"character\nbaton\" was passed alternately from\nman to woman, or woman to man,\nallowing all twelve characters to be\nplayed by only two actors. In the\nabsence of any enduring plot, the\nenergy and movement inherent in\nthe play were sustained through\nthe onstage transition between characters. This was achieved by\nthe use of cunning costume changes, and was aided by the\nabstract set - a changing room, unrelated to the situations being\nportrayed, but symbolic of the concept behind this piece of drama.\nThe acting was superb. The\nactors handled deftly the many\ntransformations between characters, their sharply defined performances presenting a range of contrasting images of sex, from the\ninnocent and beautiful to the disturbingly graphic and mechanical.\nWorking with minimal props and\nscenery, they succeeded in projecting a vibrant reality, which compelled the audience to connect\nwith the emotions and people on\nstage, despite the lack of any substantial plot.\nThe way in which four writers\nhave come together in this manner\n(although we're far from sure of\nexactly how the piece was written)\nto produce a play so involving and\nenthralling, can only serve as a testament to their ability. Perhaps this\nsignals the need for a reassessment of the current established\nview that such attempts to depict\nmodern society achieve nothing\nabove the exploitation of their own shock value.\nAbi and Matt\nPATIENCE\nICUOS Tour\nIf your idea of a good holiday is\na fortnight's lying on a beach,\nthen don't read on. The ICU OS tour does involve a beach and is a fortnight long, but the resemblance\nstops there.\nFrom time immemorial (over\n20 years anyway), Imperial College\nUnion Operatic Society has taken a production of a Gilbert and Sullivan\noperetta down to Budleigh\nSalterton. Once there, we con struct a set, manufacture cos-tum es, live in squalor at the local\nprimary school, drink huge\namounts of cider, perform ten\nshows, one Sunday concert and an\nin-house vendetta known as the\nMiddle Weekend Dinner and generally have a good time. This year\nthe operetta is \"Patience\" and the\ndates are 27 July - 1 1 August.\nBudleigh Salterton is a small\ntown on the East Devon coast, with\na pretty, but pebbly beach, a population with an average age of 105\nand a world-class croquet club. It\nalso has a public hall, which you'll\nsee a lot of, a public library, which\nyou might not visit at all, and some\ndecent pubs, which you'll probably\nlive in. We take over the primary\nschool and the public hall for the\nfortnight we're there. The audiences are amazing and appreciative. So - why take a show to\nDevon? The simple answer is that\nit's not like any other show you've\never done or ever will do. For a start, ten performances are a real\nluxury. Then there's the atmosphere, which is astonishing.\nBecause we're not there to do anything else, and there are no outside\ndistractions, it's a bit like an ocean\ncruise. Everything is very intense,\nhuge fun and the time zings past.\n\"Patience\" hasn't been performed for over ten years and is\nlong overdue for a revival. Based\non the Aesthetic Movement, the\nplot concerns two rival poets and\ntheir disastrous effect on women. The original Bunthorne, one of the\npoets was played by Oscar Wilde\nhimself. The irony was definitely\nnot lost on him. The production is\nset around 1890, and will heavily\nfeature Aubrey Beardsley type costumes and sets and Oscar Wildeesque type swooning and mel odra ma. Come and find out more on\nTuesday May5 in the Union\nConcert Hall, at 7.30 pm. Amanda\n\n"

    "content": "1 May 1998 COLUMNS 7\nm So here we are again. Of course,\nsome of us never left, stoking the\nImperial fires while you lot took it\neasy. But enough of my moaning.\nIf I said that you had missed much, I would be lying, since virtually\nnothing has happened. The BMS moves closer to completion and is\nnow officially late but under bud-get, and that's about it. No scan-dals, little gossip, apart from the\nsuggestion that the Head of Maths left in order to fulfil his ultimate\ngoal of returning as Rector, and no\nhuge money wasting, over and\nabove the norm, of course. In fact,\nlife here has been a bit boring. I trust you will rectify that.\nHaving lived in the shadow of\nOxbridge since its foundation, it\nwould seem that Imperial is now starting to make some real\nprogress, moving into second place, comfortably ahead of\nOxford and within a point of\nCambridge, according to the\nFinancial Times survey. This is\nobviously very good news. These\nthings tend to be self-per pet u at ing- as we become better, the\nmoney should flow at a greater\nrate, putting us even closer to\nCambridge. The Rector's comments are most encouraging, saying that 'our mission is simply to be\nthe best...it's not a very comfortable place to be anything less than\noutstanding...[1C students] are no\nsmarter than\nthose at Oxford and Cambridge, they are meaner\nand leaner.' Praise\nindeed, and justified,1 think you'll\nagree. Most of\nour departments\nare world class, some are as good as it gets. What a pity that such\nringing endorsements cannot be\napplied to the department that\nadministers the place. Sherfield is\nsupposed to be an enabling force\nto allow academics to do their\nteaching research, in other words\nbring home the bacon. Occupying a secondary position, it should be\n'leaner and meaner' than the rest.\nAs it is, it is over staffed, inefficient,\noften self-serving and the master\nrather than the servant. While academic departments, which have\nbeen so fulsome ly praised in this\nsurvey, are forced to survive on\nbudgets that barely match in fla tion, Sherfield\nploughs its fur-row, in wondrous isolation\nfrom the realities\nof life. Where many academics\nhave offices\nmore suitable to\nthe storage of\nbrooms and paint schemes reminiscent of\nthe Swinging Sixties, our lords\nSuite Five enjoy\nand masters in\nopulent accommodation refurbished only a few years ago. As has been shown by the medical\nmerger, the expansion of the\nCollege does not lead to real ratio-nal is ation of the administration, as\nwould happen in the real world,\nbut the creation of mickey mouse\njobs for those displaced\nfrom positions that even\nIC could not justify maintaining.\nWere Sherfieid's ability to miss\ngolden opportunities mirrored by\nthe academics, we would be running the Montessori School a close\nsecond in terms of research. Sir\nRon is clearly serious about\nbecoming the best, so why does\nhe tolerate such loss-making basket cases as Catering. Why does\nhe want the place cleaned by a hugely over staffed cleaning\ndepartment, secured by our own security people and maintained by\nan Estates Division of several hun-dred? Many of the medical campuses are showing the way, managing their affairs with the minim um of contracted staff. As I have\nsaid once or twice, we are good at\nteaching and research, not flogging exorbitantly priced s arnie s. Sort out that lot, and you create an\norganisation lean enough to\nbecome the best.\nBox of 10\n3.5\" IBM Formatted Floppy Disks\nOnly \u00a32.50 inc.

    "content": "14 MUSIC May1998 CLUB SCENE INTERVIEW IS IT A LONDON THING ?\nScott Garcia is the man behind probable the biggest garage tune of this and last year It's A London Thing, bridging the gap between underground garage and accessible dance music. Quoted by Norris Da Boss Windross as one of the first tracks to cross over bringing the \"speed\"\ngarage style of big bass-lines with more traditional garage beats. The boys done good after leaving school at the age of 13 few would have\nexpected the success that has followed and he's still only 19. It's nice to see someone so young having such an influence on the scene.\nI asked Scott how it all began\nI left school at 13 and just got into music and 1\ndidn't stop a lot of people that were into the\nscene went their own ways and got jobs and I just stuck with it, because 1 had nothing else to\ngo for that's been my one goal. 1 just gone for it\nand stuck at it, it's taken a few years 5 or 6 actually to get to where Iam now. I 've put a lot into\nit and it's just been general nagging promoters\ndoing all the stuff that up and coming DJs need\nto do. If you want to do it but don't send the\ntime on it, you won't get it.\nHave you always been strictly into garage?\nNo,No, I started off with D&B then got into\ndeep house, then more vocal sort of house and\nthat, but then it was pre-speed garage. It was\nspeed garage, but no-one called it that silly\nname. I used to have a record shop near\nWimbledon - that was were I found the music\nthat was hitting the spot for me.\nWhat is happening with garage scene at the\nmoment?\nWe're getting to a stage where the music is\nmore accepted and it's not as alien to people\nnow and they are trying to get their heads round\nit and I think a lot of people are catching on to\nwhat it's all about\nIs it a London thing?\nIt ain't no more but it was, now I'm playing all over\nthe country more and more. At the time It's a London thing was made it sort of summed up the\nvibe at the particular moment and that's why it\nwas so successful. I like to make tracks that capture a vibe and give you a picture in ya head. But\nin a way it still is a London thing cos we still got\nthe most of it. It's something Londoners should be\nproud of. The track wasn't made as a cross-over\ntrack to try and get in the charts, it was just gonna\nbe a dub plate for me to play, then we decided to\nrun with that mix and try and shift a few thousand\ncopies and get a little vibe out there. Now a few\nmonths on it's sold over thirty thousand and\ncounting. Respect to everyone that brought it,\nbecause they're locked onto the groove.\nDo you think that people tend to go out to\nhouse/garage clubs for a night out, whereas\nbefore it was more about the music?\nYeah, but the thing is when your into this underground movement thing your always trying to\nspread the word, but when you've spread the\nword it's all na na don't come thou, it's good but\nit's ours. You can't really run like that and the\nend of the day it's about sharing it, the fact that\npeople want to go to these clubs, makes people\nthat are in the scene feel good because we have\npromoted another movement in London that\nhas taken over, again.\nDo you think there are a lot of shit DJs out\nthere?\nThere always are; there are a lot of overrated DJs\nout there and I don't know how they get where\nthey are.\nIs it to do with who you know not how good\nyou are?\nWell yeah but I look at it in a positive way, people finally cotton on to these people then people like me and many others in the scene more\ndeserving will get their chance and they will be\naround a lot longer than the others.\n\"Fuck CDs, People that do CD\nmixing are people that tried\nvinyl and could not do it.\"\nWhat do you feel about all these remixes, like\nthe Cape Fear and Dread Bass remixes on\nyour tape? does it annoy you that there aren't more original tunes coming out?\nPersonally, I make fresh music, I'm not into\nrecycling - I'm not ozone friendly. When other\npeople do it as long as they do it well it's alright,\nbut if it's a pile of shit they deserve to be dissed\nfor it. I don't worry about other peoples producing skills, 1 worry about mine. If the tune moves\na crowd I 'll play it. With what is on the tape/CD\nit crosses the spectrum and that's what interested us in doing it, it covers the full range.\nWas the big break Kiss FM picking it up?\nWell yes, but really and truly they had to pick it\nup if they are the only dance station in London\nthey had to. It was inevitable u know we knew\npeople would pick up on it, in a way it was naive\nto think that it would just bubble around on the\nunderground. Now looking at it with hindsight\nit's a powerful track and know we're releasing it\nall over the world and it's going down everywhere it just hits the spot.\nWhat are you playing out at the moment?\nIt's always changing but mostly my dub-plates,\nBaffled, Tuff Jams, Anthill Mob that sort of stuff.\nIs CD mixing going to catch on?\nNot for me at all, I don't think you can beat vinyl\nIt's an art-form, it's hands on, CDs aren't. They're nice to listen to at home quality sound\nand all that but when you go to a club you want\nto hear some rugged beats not some CD, fuck\nCDs man. People that go on to CDs are for me\nthe people that tried vinyl and couldn't do it.\nIs your music going more vocal?\nWell yeah, the thing with not using vocals is that\nit's a deeper, more sort of drug gy music, you're\nlocked onto the music and you don't need the\nlyrics to get the vibe or message across, but the\ngarage scene's moving away from such a drug\norientated scene, so vocals are needed more to\nget your message across - it explains it to people not using drugs.\nWhen you make a tune do you have it all\nplanned out beforehand?\nWell I have my own style, but I don't sit there\nand think the drums are going like that, we just\nflex it, it's got to be spontaneous.\nWhat's the philosophy behind your tunes?\nI don't go into the studio and think right I'm gonna make some cheesy commercial tune\ntoday and the next day I'm gonna make some\nunderground shit. If I 've had a bad week u know\nI'm more likely to come up with dark underground track, if it's been a good week I might\nmake something that will cross over, it's about\nhow your feeling at the time.\nWhat or who are your influences?\nBob Marley, is the lick he's the don, even though\nit doesn't sound like it there are a lot of his influences and some deep related shit in my tunes.\nLittle vibes and ideas in there. Because he could\nbe political and catch the vibe of a nation at the\nsame time and that to me is what I'm about. I'm not saying that I'm the next Bob Marley or anything but there is no point just making music\naimlessly. There has to be something behind it.\nMusic that is made solely to make money is just\nplastic, plastic shit.\nWhat are you listening to at the moment?\nEverything, hip-hop, soul, swing it varies from\nday to day. But recently I 've been all Mary J Bleiged up, just chilling.\nWhat up next from you?\nThe new track is called This Ones For The Ladies\nand features Jody Breathwait on vocals along\nside Scott and MC styles should be released mid\ntoo the end of May. Thanks Scott and Jodie at Phuture trax for making it possible. I 'll leave you with a little message\nfrom Scott \" look out for the future releases\nand just keep it real.\" jo Public\n\n"

    "content": "16\nWOBEGON BOY\nGarrison Keillor\nBOOKS 1 May1998 Lake Wo be gon is a small town in MidWest America, with\ntwo types of people, Lutherans and Catholics. In Lake\nWo be gon, car ownership is a matter of faith; Lutherans buy Fords\nfrom Bunsen Motors, Catholics buy\nChevies from Main Garage.\nLutherans eat at the Chatterbox\nCafe, where the waitress, Dorothy,\nis always going to make something\nof her life, move to Minneapolis,\nbecome a singer, live a little before\nshe dies. Lutherans drive to St\nCloud occasionally to catch a movie, but not too often, you know that's good money you're spend ing, we could do something useful\nwith it, like repaint the barns.\nLutherans marry young, and tend\nto stay married, putting up with\neach other in suffering silence, the\nwomen making endless quantities\nof unwanted food, the men retreat\ninto little worlds, where they collect\nhuge quantities of useless junk,\nreluctant to throw anything away,\nyou never know when it's gonna be\nuseful. Lutherans suffer impossibly\nhot summers and frozen winters\nstoically, God willing they'll see\nanother year, and we must all be\nthankful for small mercies.\nLutherans are decent honest folk,\ndescended from Norwegians who fled Norway looking for better\nweather and better land in the New World, and wound up in Lake\nWo be gon, longing for the old co un try, learning Norwegian songs and\ndances, eating lute fish, and celebrating long forgotten Norwegian\nholidays. Lutheran men are heavy\nbuilt, slow thinking, deep breathing,\nslow talkers, who can make a sentence last a week. They don't talk\nmuch, hey, why waste your breath\nsaying nothin'? Ridiculous. They sit\non benches and clear their throats\nloudly, and proudly, with their\nstomachs hanging out, their best\nfriends, who've been with them at\nsome of the best moments of their\nlives. From this claustrophobic and\nclose society comes John Tollefson,\nwho as a child dreamt of escape.\nJohn Tollefson, the son of Byron\nand Mary, leaves Lake Wo be gon for upstate New York to manage a radio station at a college for the\nacademically challenged children of\nfinancially gifted parents. He falls in\nlove with Alida, an independent\nwoman from Boston, who loves\nhim back, but refuses to marry him,\nexalting the joys of the single life,\nand gradually learns to love and\nrespect the people he grew up\nwith, and the society he comes\nfrom.\nThis is where the book begins\nto fall apart. Garrison Keillor writes\nfluently and well about the people\nof Wo be gon, but his soft style and\ngentleness sit strangely with the\nbrashness and harshness of the\nNew Yorkers. The book is at it's best when John goes back to Lake\nWo be gon for his father's funeral.\nThe description of his father's death encapsulates the integrity of\nMid Western Americans.\n\"Dad died on the next-to-top\nbasement step on his way upstairs\nfrom having taken to the basement\na box of rubber binders that Mother\nhad told him to get rid of... While in\nthe basement, he fetched a bag of\npeas from the freezer in the laundry\nroom.. And then disaster struck as\nhe climbed the stairs. Dad suffered\nfrom arrhythmia, and as he\napproached the top, he must have\nlost his breath. He sat down...A moment later, and he was gone,\nslumped against the wall, the bag\nof frozen peas in his right hand. His\neyes were open, and he was dead.\nMother sat on the stair beside him\nand put her arm around his shoulders and smoothed his hair and\nstroked his face and kissed his\ncheek. She told him she loved him\nand always would love him. And\nthen she took the frozen peas from\nhis hand, and put them in the\nrefrigerator.\"\nIt is writing like this that encapsulates the soul of America and\nturns it into a place you' d like to\nvisit. This book isn't as good as\nprevious Wo be gon books. I feel\nthat Garrison Keillor has lost his\nway somewhat, and is struggling to\nwrite a book with a small town feel\nin a big city. That said, it is a very\ngood book, and I recommend it to\ndevotees of Lake Wo be gon. To first\ntime readers, I'd say, read Lake\nWo be gon Days or Leaving Home. The portraits painted of the small\ntown are irresistible, and the people echo characteristics of the people you know and love. Please, Mr Keillor, go back to Lake Wo be gon, and tell us more about Arlene, Irene\nand the town's largest tomato,\ntwenty-four ounces, to the Sons of\nKnute and the Living Flag, to the\nNorwegian Bachelors, with their\nunbelievable unpleasantness.\nThese are the people you know,\nand the people you've taught us to\nlove.\nJulia\nFaber &. Faber: \u00a3 16.99\nAvailable Now HUMAN CROQUET\nKate Atkinson\nBv the author of Behind (be Sttemt at th z Mnxnim\nKATE ATKINSON c0[um c in( j toque t Having read the blurb about\nthis book and it's author I started it with hopes of a quality read. Unfortunately disillusionment soon set in. Having got\npast the first few pages of clumsy\nquasi-philosophical/scientific ramblings the reader is plunged into a description of the family life of an\nadolescent girl, lso bel Fairfax, and\nher neighbours, as narrated by\nIsobel herself. Don't get me wrong,\nthere is nothing wrong with this in\nitself, the account is in fact so\nbizarre as to become horribly con-vinci ng; as we are slowly told of the\nodd people and odd happenings in\nthe Fairfax household it seems to\nbecome more and more real.\nUnfortunately the key word in that\nlast sentence is \"slowly\"; in the first\nhalf of the book virtually nothing\nhappens. Okay, so Isobel gets\nthrown into a few stray time warps and her stepmother begins to go\ninsane, but that's hardly enough to\nsustain the reader's interest for half\na book is it?\nThe whole of this first half of\nthe book does however serve to\nshow how the entire Fairfax family\nlives under the shadow of Eliza,\nIsobel's mother who disappeared\nwhen Isobel was a child. In the\nsecond half the pace of the book\nthen takes a definite turn for the\nbetter and, as well as things actually happening to Isobel, we start to\nsee the history of the mysterious\nEliza. Except it isn't that simple\nbecause we also start to get thrown\naround in different timelines, and\ntold histories which aren't strictly\naccurate, or are even totally false. 1\nhave to admit that the story does\nget more absorbing as it goes on and that the final separation of fact\nfrom fiction is done skillfully, leaving the reader satisfied but\ndepressed.\nSo it's a good story, but is it a good book?, I hear you ask. Well,\nnot particularly. In addition to the\nslow start there is a definite problem of things which distract us\nfrom the storyline without adding\nanything to it: the pretentious ramblings 1 mentioned as occurring at\nthe beginning unfortunately pop up\nsporadically throughout the book.\nKate Atkinson seems to feel that\nshe is making \"deep\", insightful\ncomments on the nature of the uni-verse, but it tends to come across\nas being almost meaningless. She\nalso says things occasionally which\nare obviously meant to be \"clever\"\ncomments but, well, they just\naren't. Even worse than this are her\nrepeated references to classics of\nliterature, which, rather than\nenriching the book, serve to highlight the fact that the authors of\nthose works were far better at their\njobs than she is. Not really the\neffect she wanted I think.\nJake the Peg\n\n"

The\nbuilding is to accommodate much\nof IC's four medical schools as\nwell as the biology department;\nthe move represents a major\ndevelopment in the ICSM merger.\nSchal, the company responsible\nfor the venture, have claimed that\nspecialist custom is ation of the\nbuilding will take longer than\nexpected and subsequently solicited an extension of their schedule at\na recent BMS steering committee.\nThis follows an approved request\nfor deference at the previous committee meeting, and the building,\nwhich was originally due for handover on13 April, will not become\navailable until midsummer. The matter has caused particular concern amongst medical staff\nas it seems their previously modified plans are to be undermined\nonce again. ICU president Andy\nHeeps, himself a medic, is anxious\nto preserve the good name of\nICS M especially at such a pivotal\npoint in its institution. He envisioned \"Straight ' A' students having a disastrous first few weeks\"\ndue to a lack of time for appropriate staff preparation, thereby wasting the effort invested in attracting\ntop-flight students.\nOn a recent tour of the site the\nUnion president claimed that\n\"workers were noticeable by their\nabsence\" and felt the difficulties\nexperienced with custom is ation should be addressed by increasing\nemployment. He went on to say\nthat without taking specific measures to focus the project on meeting targets, \"the whole project will\nbe blown out of the water\".\nPhil Hilton, Schal project man ager, was quick to defend the company' s actions, insisting the specialists could only be brought in\nonce the building's infrastructure\nwas complete, and that news of\nthe problems with custom is ation was only recently available. He stated there was a \"degree of\nadaptation to the generic structure\nneeded\" which affects 60 rooms,\nthis compelled him to request the\nhand-over date be postponed from\n8 June by 3-4 weeks. These measures will allow for the completion\nof building and full commissioning\nand Mr. Hilton was certain the\ndelay was \"nothing to do with the\nmen not putting the hours in.\" However, the Principal of ICS M Chris Edwards, is far from satisfied\nwith Schal's performance. Describing the handover postponement as an \"inappropriate and\nunfortunate delay\", he was aware\nthat \"safety has to be paramount\"\nbut saw a very difficult summer\nahead for the medical school.

This\nalbum compilation should be\nregarded as a chapter in the production history of these two artists.\nRuffneck Ting Records was launched in 1993 as a natural progression of\nthe now legendary club nights of the\nsame name. I got the chance to have a chat with them about the ideas behind\nthe album and about that rare breed -the female D]/ Producer.\nJP: Tell about the ideas behind this\nalbum.\nMarkee: It's basically about getting our\ndues. We' ve been putting out 12\"s for\nyears now but they don't get the coverage,\nso we have taken some of the strongest\nreleases from our back catalogue as well as\nfour totally new pieces. Also with doing an\nalbum you haven't got the pressure of\nmaking tracks for the dancefloor, it gives\nyou more freedom.\nWe've got a strong crew here and\nwe've been here since the beginning a lot of the\nartists we have here are reaching breaking point\nand there're ready to blow up big time but we need the backing of a major to help take us to\nthe next level this album should do that. With\nthings like videos it's hard to do it with out the\nbacking or the experience but we've got all the\nideas it's just the backing.\nDazee: As the name suggests this is an album\ndesigned to cover the drum and bass spectrum,\nfrom phat jump up numbers like L.F Ant; deep\nsci-fi roll age of Own Way too the sassy funk of\nWestside, a collection that covers all styles.\nDazee, has it made it easier getting DJ work\nbeing female?\nD: No not really because most of the clubs I play\nat it's either me. Rap or Emma it's like a token\nfemale DJ. I have to fill in now and then for\nthem, they have to have the token female.\nWhy do you feel there are so few female D|s and producers?\nD:I don't think it crosses a lot of girls minds\nthey know what they like musically, there are a lot of girls that love the scene as you can see\nfrom the crowds. I don't know why but I 've\nalways liked doing blok es things I suppose I was\na bit of a tomboy when I was younger.\nHow would you describe your sound, Dj wise?\nD: Bouncy, funky stuff mixed up with some dark\nstuff, I like a lot of musical stuff. I think that\nworks well with the more minimal and darker\ntunes, flowing in and out over each other.\nIs your producing sound different?\nD: Not really, I'm just coming to terms with\nthe way I'm producing, and getting my\nown sound, which is like quite a lot going\non.\nDo you still get a buzz out of Djing?\nD:Oh yeah, if I didn't it would be time to\n| stop.\nHow did you get into producing?\nD: We wanted to make tunes that we wanted to play.\nFavourite Djs?\nD: Randall I love the way he structures his\nsets and Andy C rocks.\nProducers?\nD: Andy C, Krust, Roni Size ' n' crew and\nDecoder.\"\nYou've been playing abroad a lot what's the scene like in other country's?D: Well I 've been playing in New York, Paris\nand Amsterdam recently and they are\nmainly small clubs that have a core follow-ing. In NY they are well clued up on all the dub-plate culture, calling for the rewinds and all that.\nThanks to Dazee and Marke e for the chat and I wish them well, don't forget you can catch\nDazee playing all over the place but mainly at\nRuff Neck Ting Bristol and most of the major\nevents like Dreamscape and Helta Skelta.\nBasically this is a ruff and diverse album that\nis well worth a listen and I believe it is only being\nreleased on CD as all the singles that haven't already been released will be shortly.

    "content": "oh n Grisham has a knack\nfor creating a good read\nand so far all of his screen\nadaptations have been decent films. This comes despite the glaring similarities of his story lines,\nwhich all display a tendency to\nend-up with a David versus Goliath\ncourt-room battle.\nRudy, played by Matt Damon, is the newcomer to the ups and downs of the litigation in Memphis' American courts, a place where the\nlawyers are as abundant as the\nprostitutes and 'where the only difference is that the pro's stop\nscrewing you for money after your\ndead'. Rudy dives into the deep\nend as his first client takes on an\ninsurance company who refuses to\npay for his leukemia treatment. Our legal Goliath is played by Jon\nVoight, an intimidating adversary\nfor our inexperienced lawyer but\nduring the court case Rudy exposes the greed and corruption of a company that offers security but\nnever pays out. The Rainmaker is\nnot quite the Perry Mason of court\ncases but steps back to a newco mers point of view as Rudy has to learn court etiquette on the job.\nAs the saying goes, don't become involved with your clients.\nFILM\nTHE RAINMAKER\nStarring: Matt Damon, Danny DeVito, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Mickey Rourke, Dean Stockwell\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMatt Damon stand's up ruth, justice and the American way.\nOur new lawyer's inexperience,\nyouthful ideals and the desire to do good, however, lead him into the\nopposite direction. Rudy becomes\ninvolved with a women with an\nabusive husband, and persuades\nher to apply for divorce, and rents\nan apartment from an old lady who he has advised on her will. All these\nare little details that could have\nbeen washed over in the final print,\nbut I'm glad they remained.\nThe Rainmaker was directed by\nFrancis Ford Coppola, and he does\nMay1998 a superb job of developing the\ncharacters and creating the emo tion of the film. The Rainmaker\nhowever, is totally different fr on The Godfather or Apocalypse Nov\nwhich were created with his hear\nand soul, and after his recent film:\nsuch as Dracula and jack you star\nto wonder if he needed a film tha\nwould carry him to glory, ra the than the other way round. The\ncasting is the only strange point tc\nthis film, John Grisham's book:\ntend to have a huge number o characters that play some imp or tant role, and with the s cree r adaptation of The Rainmaker i large array of well know ' B' lis\nactors have been given fleet in j parts in the film. Mickey Rourke\nplays a lawyer who puts Rudy or\nthe payroll before being indicted b\\ the FBI and making a speedy exit tc\nthe Caribbean. Dean Stockwell is i judge who dies shortly into the\nfilm, and Virginia Madsen is a dis\ngrunt led employee who helps Rud\\\nto expose the insurance scam.\nTo put it simply, The Rainmake\nis a good film with an excellent plo\n- but some may say that films car\nnever compare to books.\n\u2022 Magpit\nTHE BIG LEBOWSKI\nStarring: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi\nDirector: Joel Coen \u2022 \u2022 fh Jeff Bridges is The Dude, a man who\nredefines the phrase \"laid back\".\nAs ever with the Coen broth-ers, their latest film has very\nlittle in common with their\nlast. Having jumped from romantic\ncomedy to thriller to film noir to black comedy in the past, The Big\nLebowski, leaps in a whole new direction, corresponding to no known film genre.\nJeff Bridges is The Dude, the\nultimate laid back American, living\nin a trailer-park, philo soph ising and\nbowling with his stark raving mad Vietnam vet buddy, John\nGoodman, and inept, weasel y Steve Buscemi. It's a part that\nBridges must have dreamed of all\nhis life, so closely does it match his\nreal life persona (interviews portray\nhim as someone happy to be an\n\"ageing hippie\"), and one he slips\ninto perfectly. Goodman too relishes the ability to completely ham it\nup - playing the ultimate trauma-tis ed vet, still living out the Cold\nWar - although director Joel Coen carefully avoids the temptation to\nslip into farce.\nSomehow, he gets caught up in\na kidnapping case, when he is mistaken for a millionaire recluse of\nthe same name. Charged with\nhanding over the cash that will\nsecure the return of the millionaires\nyoung wife, disaster after disaster\nstrikes. Goodman, by turns psychopathic and coldly confused, is\nintent on taking on the world. But\nthe millionaires pseudo art-freak\ndaughter, a very scary prospect in\nthe shape of julianne Moore is convinced that it's all a scam, and\ninsists that Bridges holds onto the\ncash. And then it all starts getting\ncomplicated.\nBut it's at this point that the difference that the words \"a film by\nJoel and Ethan Coen\" create associates itself. Rather than turning into\nyet another Tarantino clone, or\nindeed a rehash of Fargo, The Big\nLebowski is simply different.\nMoving seamless ly from grim black\ncomedy to utterly absurd is t big\nlaughs, the story of the Dude is\nimbued with the Coen's trademark\nmix of gritty reality and pure fanta-sy. This, along with an amazing\nability to instantly pick up the\nmood and feel of a genre (whilst\navoiding pastiche) is the element of\nthat marks out all their work, from\nthe Hudsucker Proxy to Fargo.\nOnce again, the Coen brothers\nprove themselves completely different to anyone else out there.\nYou could leave the cinema feeling\nthat nothing has happened for two hours, or you could tap into their\nwarped genius and see the slick\npastiche of a genuine \"everyman\"\ncharacter caught up in a Raymond\nChandler novel.

    "content": "20\nTHE TAO OF JOURNALISM\nARTS 1 May1998 WAY OF THE WARRIOR\nPeacock Theatre\nW ay of the Warrior was intended to be a cultural\nshow, proclaiming martial\nforms as artistic; an ambitious and\nchallenging project, presenting a wide variety of martial arts in\nunderstandable ways to a predominantly western audience.\nThe show started well, with\nKalarippayattu, an art native to\nSouth-West India. The moves were\nwell practised, and included various weapon forms, including the\nsword, dagger, staff, shield and\nflexible sword. Empty hand moves\nwere included in the performance,\nboth in their own right and as\nresponses to weapon attacks. It\nwas surprising then, that the exponents themselves did not appear as\nfit and well-toned as one might\nexpect of martial artists. The\nforms, however stylised for the\nshow, were obviously effective and\nwell executed.\nNext came Krabbi Krabbong, an\nart from Thailand in which the\nartists presented a performance of\n\"The Monkey King\". This is where\nthe show started to lose its way,\nand I found it very difficult to tell\nwhether the dance was farcical\nbecause of the content or because\nof the very poor performance.\nThere was virtually no real martial\nart involved; all the action took\nplace in a totally choreographed\nfashion, reminiscent of a cheap\nimitation of the Teenage Mutant\nNinja Turtles.\nThis was followed by Pencak\nSilat, one of many Indonesian fighting styles. Various displays of both\nweapon and empty hand forms\nwere performed, including some excellent examples of pinning and\ntrapping techniques similar to |udo.\nA few of the performances were\nindividual; disappointing, as without the application, the technique\nbecomes fairly meaningless to the\nuninitiated.\nStarkly contrasting with the previous play, Beijing Opera were\nexcellent. Although performed entirely in Chinese, the play was\nabsorbing, funny and extremely\nwell acted. The players used sim-ple, though decorated, staffs to act\nout a scene from \"Fighting Jiao\nZan\" and showed how well the\nmartial arts can be incorporated\ninto theatre.\nKabuki, Japanese Classical\nTheatre, is almost completely\nunfathomable without a good understanding of the background,\nand was correspondingly very hard\nto follow. It was evident that it was\nregarded as a purely theatrical\nform, despite the use of a Naginata, a halberd. The weapon was used solely as a prop, not as\nan exhibition of the training. This\nwas extremely disappointing, as I practise laid o, in which Naginata\nare sometimes used, and watching\nthis was akin to watching someone play air guitar while listening to Jimi\nHendrix. Iam sure that Gojo\nMasanosuke is very good at Kabuki\nperformance, but he is an actor,\nnot a martial artist.\nThen the high point of the\nevening arrived, Shaolin Kung-Fu.\nThis was a display of excellent martial skill, marred only by the lack of\napplication. All the forms were\nshown individually, but with such\nprecision and feeling that one\ncould not help but be impressed.\nAlthough very good, it also brought\nthe whole show into sharp per-spec ti ve. Compared to the Shaolin\nmonks, all the other acts paled into\ninsignificance, and I couldn't help\nwondering whether this was the\nwhole point. Why had none of the\nother main arts such as Tae-KwonDo, Karate, judo, or Wing Chun\nbeen demonstrated? This is surprising when one considers that many\nof these have their UK headquarters locally; just five minutes walk\nfrom the theatre, anyone can train\nwith an 8th Dan Karateka. I became\neven more cynical when, on leaving\nthe theatre, I discovered the whole\nof the Shaolin Kung-Fu group out-side, signing autographs.\nPutting my cynicism aside for a moment, there were some important aspects presented. Martial\nArts are just that: forms practised\nby skilled artists, whose expertise\nbears no relation to street thug ger y. Without philosophy and devotion\nto study, the martial arts degenerate into no more than foolish pos-turing. Thus, shows such as this\nmight be considered the best way\nto present these Arts: not as com petitions but as exhibitions of skill.\nThe only true way to a test a fighting form is to fight until only one is\nleft standing, not a prospect that\nmodern societies encourage. In\nthis, the most important point was\nnot explored: the True Way of the\nWarrior is to win without a fight.\nStephen Starkie\nBIEDERMAIMIM UN DIE BRANDSTIFTER\nGoethe Institute\nT he European Theatre\nCompany, under the direction of Sabine Bauer, recently\npresented their touring production\nof \" Bie der mann und die Brandstifter,\" (known in English as \"The\nFireraisers,\") Frisch's satirical exposure of the human reluctance, or\neven inability, to acknowledge the\npresence of danger, no matter how obvious. The plot of the play is\nlargely transparent, the eventual\noutcome obvious from the begin-ning, which means that we concern\nourselves less with the events being\nplayed out before us, an more with\nthe meaning behind them. The play\nwas performed in German by a cast\nof mixed German and English ori-gins, with the Greek-style chorus\nspoken in English.\nThe play, set in a city plagued\nby arson attacks, charts the down fall of the wealthy Herr\nBiedermann, (\"Mr. Worthy,\") who despite his constant complaints of\nthe level of arson in the neighbour-hood, appears blind to the possibility of his falling victim to the that\nvery thing. Biedermann feels obliged to take into his home the retired\nboxer Schmitz, who plays on all his\nperceptions of moral obligation,\nand who somehow evades all subsequent suggestion that he leave.\nHe then invites his accomplice,\nEisenring, to join him, and together\nthey begin the preparations for the\nburning of the Biedermann residence, making no attempt to conceal their activities.\nHere the role of chorus is\nplayed by the ever watchful fire\nbrigade, \"die Waechter der\nVaterstadt,\" who must be constantly alert to signs of fire. Frisch's chorus differs from the Greek chorus in\nthat its members are no longer\nimpartial observers, being in the\nemploy of the townspeople. Since\nthe chorus was spoken by most of\nthe company, the use of English\nserved both to separate it from the\ncharacters of the play and to\nheighten its detachment from mortal goings-on. The speeches of\nFrisch's chorus are characterised by\nhighly rhythmic poetry, here\naccentuated by sharp movements\nof the head and body.\nThe play is people d by\ngrotesquely inflated characters,\nand these were brought out by the\nstylised acting of the whole cast.\nThe cast made use of much exaggerated mime, which, although\nrequiring considerable skill, enabled\nthem to present a stylised view of\nthe actions portrayed whilst retaining some degree of reality.\nAs the play reaches its\ninevitable conclusion, we witness a hideous scene in which Bie der mann attempts to appease Schmitz and Eisenring through an\ninvitation to a dinner of goose.\nDuring the meal, the two fire raisers\nbait Biedermann by openly discussing their activities, and the hysterics of Babette and Biedermann's impotence reach new peaks.\nBiedermann is finally goaded into\nlending Schmitz his matches, and\nwe are left with a cacophony of\nexplosions and sirens from\nthroughout the city.\nThe company employed many\ndevices to increase the effect of the\nplay, and to bring out the humour\nwithin it. The staging was particularly effective, with the loft in which\nthe fire raisers stored fuel and laid\ntheir fuses separated only by a slight difference in height from the\nBiedermann dining room, so that a certain mental leap was required to\nseparate the events occurring in\neach. The portrayal of the fire raisers themselves, as carrying out\ntheir actions in a very calm and\ndeliberate fashion, almost as a game, seemed to hint that they,\ndetached from humanity, would\nachieve their aim of destruction by\nfire with or without human inter-vent ion. This production certainly\nsucceeded in achieving Frisch's goal\n- to present us with a parable of\nthis particular human folly, and to\nleave us with much to consider.\nAbi Kirk\n\n"

A private company, currently running the bar at the\nHammersmith Hospital campus, has stepped in with a tender for\nboth of the other bars, and it is\nexpected that a deal will be\nfinalised during the next few\nweeks.\nThe current system, whereby\nthe bars are run by the Charing\nCross and Mary's Union's respectively, comes to an end this su mmer as part of the integration\nprocess. The future of the bars had\nuntil now seemed uncertain, with\nboth College and the Union declaring themselves unable to run either\nat a profit. A key issue in the recent\nsabbatical elections, where all successful candidates promised to\nensure the survival of the bars if at\nall possible, the fate of the bars\nhas been something of a hot pot a to, with responsibility continually\nbeing shifted between the Medical\nSchool, Union and College hierarchy. Further setbacks were suffered\nover Easter, with the resignation of\nthe bar manager at Charing Cross\nsuggesting that the bar might never\nre-open. Questions have also been\nraised over breaches of the license\nat Gladys, the St Mary's student\nbar.\nAll rent and associated proceeds arising from the tender will\ngo to the medical school. However, the prospect of a successful conclusion to the tender\nprocess has been warmly greeted\nby senior Union figures, both at\nSouth Ken and the med schools, as\nit will safeguard a vital student\nservice. The expected deal will be\nparticularly good news, as it offers\nboth a secure future for the bars for\nat least the next two years, and the\nsuggestion of even lower bar\nprices.\nAn announcement is expected\non the deal very soon, bringing to\nan end one of the most problematic issues surrounding the medical\nmerger.\nRevellers reach Trafalgar Square in the pro-cannabis rally on 28\nMarch. The protest, organised by the Independent on Sunday news-paper, attracted and estimated 20,000 people. Gathering first in\nHyde Park, the march proceeded down Park Lane and east along\nPiccadilly, halting traffic in the city. At Trafalgar Square, the campaigners were met by bright sunshine and speeches from celebrities\nsuch as Rosie Boycott (loS Editor) and Howard Marks. Although\njoints were being smoked openly by many, there was no police action\nand the day passed peacefully and enjoy ably.

    "content": "10\nALBUMS\nMUSIC\nPULP\nThis Is Hardcore \u2022\u2022\u2022'/2\nMay1998 No longer of a different class, now Pulp\nget hardcore...\nA nd so Pulp come back from\ntheir three-year hiatus. Last\ntime we heard them, Jarvis\nand company were playing us the\nMercury Award-winning Different\nClass and they were showing us\ntheir commentary on our own lives.\nYou know, work pressure, living a stressful life, strange sexual perversions and that sort of thing. It was\na much more mature album than\nHis 'n' Hers and it showed that\nthere was more to Pulp than the\npop leanings of Common People,\nand a darker side got partially\nunveiled. With This Is Hardcore,\nthat darker side comes out far\nmore.\nJarvis' background as a film student at Central St. Martins has\nnever been more prominent in the\nsongs than this. Each track is\nalmost like a story in itself - as\nusual, commentaries on the less\ncommon sides of life. The Fear\nopens up the album and may well\nseem long and drawn out on the\nfirst listen, but after a while, it starts\nto sit comfortably. It lacks that pop thing that Pulp do but you don't really notice. Could it be that they\nhave started to write songs that are\nnot easy to listen to? Pulp? Come on, they can't be doing that can\nthey? Let's start looking at the\nother evidence. The title track, This\nIs Hardcore seems to loom in the\ndistance as Candida Doyle plays a bleak piano plays a sparse melody\nunderneath the tired sounding vocals. This is amongst many\ntracks that seem to have been\ninspired by some fifties B movie\nand even the promotional video\nmatches this idea. There are tracks\nthat, on the surface, give an\nimpression that they're about some\nsort of domestic chore (Dishes) but\nopen up to reveal a whole lot more\nthan any initial thought. It almost\nseems as if they've let you into\ntheir beautifully-tended back garden where everything seems too be\na little too perfect. All the grass is\nmown and the borders are perfect.\nBut you know that it's all a bit rotten at the core somewhere. The\nnext stone you turn over will be\nseething with some horrible crea-ture s. There are those tracks that are\nalso a bit hard to understand in the\ncontext. Help The Aged is one of\nthem. 'Help the aged, don't just\nput them in a home/It's not much\nfun when you 're on your own.'\nAhem, excuse me? Is this the\nCommon People for the crusty\ngeneration or something? It is\ngood, though. Sylvia seems to be a teen memory song that's strangely\nreminiscent of Something Changed\nfrom Different Class and other cool\ntracks include, Pretty Hard and A Little Soul.\nSo, back to my initial question.\nIs it difficult to listen to? Then\nanswer is a resounding maybe.\nMaybe it is for the first few times\nbut after that, it starts to get better\nand burrows into your mind. It's a scary thought really. H Alok\nMOKE\nSuperdrag\nS tuck in a foreign country and\nwithout the services of the\nworldwide web over the holi-days, I was powerless to find out\nany background information about\nMoke. This is a shame as I liked\nthem and wanted to find out how long they've been around and if\nthey've got any other stuff out\nthere. I 'll resist the temptation to\nmake any idle Audio web comparisons straightaway as Moke manage to pull out a diverse bag of\ntracks.\nThe opener, Sleepyhead, is a loud beginning and is much like\nmid-album track Wheel in Motion.\nBoth have a heavy bassline and a groovy feel to them. A Black Grape\ncum Audio web style delivery\n(Whoops!) lends itself well to these\nsongs. There's other kids round the\nmusical block, however. Down is a cool and initially quiet number that\noccasionally strays dangerously\nclose to Bon Jovi but we'll let them\noff just this once. In Your Dreams is\na beautiful bittersweet ballad.\n\"Motherly eyes. Fatherly smiles. I will scare you in your dreams.\" The\nhaunting lyrics, are in clear contrast\nto the pacified music that is occasionally tinged with some Indian\nstrings for good measure. Mislaid\nthe Key is a traditional blues num ber with accompanying customary\nhammering riff and a rising vocal\nvolume that culminates with the\ncool \"/ feel I hold the answer and I know it's here in me. I realise I'm locked out.... I think I might have\nmislaid the key.\" Powercut is powerful stuff but I don't think it's unfair to say the chorus is so much\nlike Rage Against the Machine that\nit could be called Bombtrack Part\nTwo. That's not to take its power\naway from it, as it's still a rousing\nnumber.\nMoke are one of those bands\nthat you're glad you found, as\nthere's a lot to like. However, after\na while I just grew tired of them, as\nthey became more familiar.\nInitially, Superdrag turns out to be\nanything but. I don't think this'll\nstand any test of time, though.\nHave a listen rather than go out\nand buy. H Dennis\nPITCHSHIFTER\nwww.pitch shifter. com *\nw f dysfunction is our fun cI tion then I must be some\n& kind of genius,\" screams\nJ.S. Clayden, lead vocalist (chief\nwarble-is er would probably be a more accurate term) with\nPitchshifter and boy is he not\nfuckin' kidd in'. I feel obliged to\nswear, as although this album is\nswear-word free, I have a sneaky\nfeeling that the Pitchshifter live\nexperience, which I'm sure it would\nbe, would be littered with expletives not to mention testosterone\nfuelled teenagers trying to knock\nseven shades of shit out of each\nother. The more bruises the better.\nFor those who don't know what\nPitchshifter sound like already,\nhere's an attempt at a description:\nImagine a juggernaut powering through your home with speakers\nattached to each wheel spewing\nout noise at a maximum volume,\nhalf of which is distortion. Think\npunk, think anti-establishment,\nthink chainsaw guitars, think tech-no, and think huge dirty and heavy\nindustrial machinery. Think of four\npeople that have just escaped from\nthe local asylum. Now, let these\nn utters stick all of the above ingredients into a melting pot. Let them\nchew and digest it and you could\nsafely say that this album is what\nthey would vomit it into your face.\nIntense, angry, anti-social and\ndysfunctional are all flabbergasting\nunderstatements. Pitchshifter can\nproduce only one of three functions, which probably tell you something of your character. One,\nyou can be totally disgusted and be\nin desperate need of a shower to\ncleanse yourself of this filth. Two,\nyou can become a fan and go to\nconcerts where you can meet like-minded people or three, you can\nlaugh your tits off. I'm a number\nthree man myself. There is actually\na saving grace, believe it or not.\nThere are fifty free samples for you\nto steal and use in your own music.\nThere is, however, a fantastic\ncatch. You are actually asked to\ncredit Pitchshifter by name. You\ncould always lie, though. H Dennis\n\n"

    "content": "1 May 1998 MUSIC\nINTERVIEW+ CIG+ ALBUM ON THE ROAD TO SOMETHING UPLIFTING\nPURESSENCE take time out to talk about their return to the music scene\nT he Camden Falcon's Bar Fly\nnight is the venue\nPuressence have chosen to\nhost their return to gigging life in\nEngland after having traversed\nEurope for a few dates. Oh yeah,\nand they've also been in the studio\nbusy creating a whole new batch of\nsongs for their forthcoming second\nlong player. The first release from\nit, This Feeling was receiving saturation airplay on Radio 1 over\nEaster and you would also get a shock if you heard the strains of\nPuressence playing over the top of\nsome annoying afternoon DJ.\nIt is late March and the day is\nfittingly cold and rainy (generally\ndepressing weather, you get the\ndrift), the type you would assuredly say most closely resembles\nPuressence's musical style.\nUnfortunately this musical style has\nseen them being accused of rehashing '80s gothic melodies and\nyou couldn't blame yourself for this\nmisconception. If you have only\nheard singles like Fire and India\nfrom their debut album you' d be\nconvinced they are wannabe '80s goths attempting to sneak in a bit\nof pop. If you have heard all the\nalbum you would be a lot more\nclued up to their real sound, with\nabsolute scorchers like Traffic Jam\nIn Memory Lane.\nAfter having braved the elements I finally locate a nearby pub\nwhere the interview is to take\nplace. When I arrive the band are\nalready chatting away to a group of\njourn os and fanzine writers about\ntheir new album and how it feels to\nbe back on the live circuit. I wait for\na slightly later chat after it's fin-is he d. Lead singer James Mudriczki\nis in a talkative mood and he's joined by Kevin Matthews(bass)\nand Neil McDonald( guitar).\nThey've been enjoying themselves\ngigging around Europe and eager to\nembark on their UK return. James\nlikens their attitude to 'a geezer\nwhose been celibate and now wants to fuck.' Puressence are\nkeen to clear up any assumptions\nabout their new material, and\nJames says, 'Well, to us it's moved on. The first album is pretty dark. A lot of people mistake the first\nalbum for being very dark, but it's not. What we're trying to do is\nwrite uplifting music and I think the\nsecond album is more than the\nfirst.' Kevin joins in, 'The last album\nis about where we' ve been\nand...you know, what we're doing\nnow. This album is about where we\nwant to be going...where we want\nto be.'\nAre they worried that now they\nwill probably be expanding their\nfanbase and will soon be playing\nlarger venues and sacrificing the\nmore intimate atmosphere of\nsmaller places for this. James:\n'Don't get me wrong but it's a great\nfucking pub The Bar Fly, but I know\nwe could play larger venues. I think\nit's just the fans who are up their\nown ring pieces and get fucking\nthat pretentious because the band\nis on a big stage. The fact is that\nthey're still doing the same thing.\nThey might be 50 miles away from\nyou but you can still be close knit.'\nSomehow, I don't think anyone\nwho's been to Wembley Stadium\nwold agree.\nLooking to the future\nPuressence don't seem too concerned and James quips, 'I reckon\nme and you( pointing at Neil) will\nbe sharing a fucking shelf in\nWandsworth for armed robbery.'\nPuressence put their planned\nheist on hold tonight to grace us\nwith a whole new safe load of\nsongs. The Bar Fly venue is a little\ntoo intimate, forcing fans to watch\nwith craned necks round the side of\nthe bar. The songs sound uplifting\nbut the smallness of the venue\nmakes them seem constricted. The\ncrowd are really up for it and it\nseems as though even the most\n'pretentious' of fans would willingly\nturn up to any large scale gig.\nSeems as though you're wrong,\nJames.... EH Jason\nTHERAPY\nSemi-Detached \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 v2D \u00a3tW*^ Von* wanna look\npe hind me!\" screams\nAndy Cairns. It remains\nto be seen how many demons the\nBelfast child has left to exorcise.\nStill angry after all these years,\nthere are plenty of paranoid lyrics\nand angry rants. Check out\nTramline where the only lyrics are\nspat out again and again amida frenzy of guitar roughage, \"I'm getting swallowed up in all of this and\nthe last thing I need is some rock\nstar bullshit.\" Then there's Bom\nToo Soon where he comparatively\nwhispers \"In your weakest\nmoments, it all comes back to you like a ghost.\"\nOriginally titled Ice Cream Headache, Semi Detached is much better than their previous release,\nInfernal Love. There's been somewhat of a slight return to the loud\nguitars, huge power chords and big\nfat choruses that was Troublegum.\nThis can be seen through the leading single Church of Noise and others scattered around the album\nsuch as Black Eye Purple Sky, Don't Expect Roses and Lonely, Cryin',\nOnly. That's not to say that\nTherapy? have taken a step back;\nthis is definitely a progression with\na few technical tricks to enhance\nthe show as Andy explains in an\ninterview, \" On Safe 1 wanted to use\na Rotovibe and volume pedal\nsimultaneously, so I had to tape\nthe pedals together with a plank of\nwood. Basically, you have all the\npedal's electronics in your boot\nsoles so, as you rock back and\nforth on your heels, you get a wah wah sound. Wah wah boots!\nFantastic!\"\nFantastic indeed, as Safe is\nprobably the standout track. Semidetached is essentially for those\nthat liked Troublegum and want\nmore of the same with a couple of\ncomparatively quiet (as Therapy?\nare never actually quiet; it's not in\ntheir nature) tracks thrown in to give\nsome balance and diversity. I can\nsee them banging out a good percentage of these tracks live and\nsending the crowd into a pogo-ing\nfrenzy. However, as an album, on\nyour own stereo, in your own home,\nit just doesn't quite cut it. H Dennis\nReviews are given a mark out of\nfive as follows...\nKen Livingstone\nkkk it Howard Marks\nkkk Glenda Jackson\nkk Richard Branson\nk Stephen Norris\nNo Stars Jeffery Archer\n\n"
