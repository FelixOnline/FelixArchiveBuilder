    "content": "22 FRIDAY 17 JAN\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson, William\nStocker\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nI\nt\u2019s difficult for any side project\nto ever be judged in comparison\nto anything but their parent\nband, and when that band\nis Godspeed You! Black\nEmperor, it is probably never going\nto go well for you. Starting as A Silver\nMt. Zion in 1999, Thee Silver Mt.\nZion Memorial Orchestra are onto\ntheir seventh album and fifth name\n(including the memorable Thee Silver\nMt. Zion Memorial Orchestra and\nTra-La-La Band with Choir). They\nare probably the best known of the\nnumerous Godspeed side projects,\nand a lazy journalist might describe\nthem as Godspeed without the\nexperimenation. They do bring a few\nnew things to the table though, with\nthe addition of vocals in particular\nbeing an interesting innovation.\nThey\u2019ve taken a backseat for the\nA Thrill-Ver Mount Zion\nAMS album of the week\nWarpaint, the eponymous follow-up\nto 2010\u2019s well-received debut, The Fool,\noffers a different manifestation of the\nLA foursome\u2019s brand of delicate rock\nmusic. It smacks of the same cohesion\nwhich The Fool was noted for, however,\nwhereas The Fool was generally\ncharacterised by a restless streak,\nWarpaint presents a departure towards\na more natural, slow burn. Indeed, it\nopens with a clue that this might be\nthe case: a peek behind the abstracting\nmask of musical production at a quirk\nof their recording process. Warpaint are inviting us into their world rather\nthan presenting it to us from the outside.\nThis idea continues seamlessly on the second track, Keep It Healthy,\nwhich further defines the approach the band appears to have taken when\ncomposing the album. They guide us on a journey through with gradual,\ngentle touches, settling on the most satisfying hooks and repeating them\nin an appealing way. By doing so, we are allowed more time to get the\nmost out of each musical thread before the journey starts off again. Feeling\nAlright is another track which shares this quality and sounds as anthemic\nand uplifting as anything the band has produced as a result. The album\u2019s\nmelodies are generally delivered at a slow tempo which allows the sleepy,\ndreamy introspection of tracks like Drive and Teese, a stripped-down\nlove-note of a song which may be the album\u2019s most personal and heartfelt\nmoment.\nThat\u2019s not to say we ever stray into too indulgent or maudlin territory.\nTime is still found to show flashes of a mercurial edge reminiscent of The\nFool on Hi and Disco//Very which stand in stark contrast to Biggy and Go\nIn which respectively follow the two tracks. Hi, my personal favourite, kicks\noff with a drum beat and bass line so grippingly seductive that they wouldn\u2019t\nsound out of place on a Portishead record. The single, Love Is To Die, also\nfalls into this category, the urgent bass indicating a digression from the\nalbum\u2019s main arc. These three songs importantly provide depth beyond the\npicture of peaceful contemplation which the album otherwise builds.\nWarpaint is both artistically beautiful and easily listenable. It achieves\nthe feat of delivering emotional extremes in gradual, friendly doses.\nAlthough it bears hallmarks of the same group of four which produced\nThe Fool, it is musically more straightforward, which results in a more\naccessible but nonetheless rewarding album.\nWarpaint \u2013 Warpaint\nlast few years due to the Godspeed\nreunion, meaning that Fuck Off Get\nFree We Pour Light on Everything\nis their first album since 2010. It\u2019s\ndefinitely been worth the wait, and\nnot just because of, you know, the\nGodspeed reunion.\nOpening track, Fuck Off Get Free (for\nthe Island of Montreal) opens with a\ngrungey shoegaze with strings affair\nbefore descending into a hypnotic\nwaltz. This all culminates in crushing,\nalmost doom metal type guitar overlain with a screeching guitar wail and\nchanted vocals. It is an absolutely superb track. This is a track that wouldn\u2019t\nfeel out of place on a Godspeed record,\nand would have been a highlight on the\nmost recent one. It also taught me that\nMontreal is on an island, which is useful knowledge... Austerity Blues has\na slow start, building into a droning\nunrelenting guitar track that gets a bit\nmuch after a few minutes. As the crescendo hits, and the screeching guitar\nsings out a beautiful melody, you can\u2019t\nhelp but fall into its trap. This leads to\na big noise jam, before that dies off too\nand reemerges soft and becalmed. Take\nAway These Early Grave Blues is the\nfirst shorter track on the album (but\nstill clocking in at slightly under seven\nminutes\u2026) and as such, doesn\u2019t really\nlet up from its combination of distorted guitars and manic strings. That\u2019s not\nto say I want it to though, especially as\nit\u2019s followed by the actually quite short\n(two and a half minutes) Little Ones\nRun, a pretty piano led affair. What\nWe Loved Was Not Enough has a similarly calm opening, and whilst it does\nbuild into something a bit louder, it\ndoesn\u2019t ever build\ninto something\nthat catches the\nimagination in the\nsame way the earlier epics did. Rains\nThru the Roof at\nthe Grande Ballroom (for Rough\nSteez) is a bit of\nan oddity. Really\nquiet drumming\nunderpins shimmering strings and\na clinky piano. It\u2019s\ndefinitely a change\nin style and it is\na really nice end\nto the album.\nThis is a really\ngreat album. It\u2019s\ncertainly not a poor man\u2019s Godspeed\nrecord. It is something a bit different\n(and not as good). Post-rock has been\nretreading a hell of a lot of ground\nin recent years, and this doesn\u2019t exactly break the mould, but there\u2019s a\nfew novel ideas and it\u2019s not as if the\nrest of it is run-of-the-mill. It\u2019s also\none of the better SMZ releases, and\ndefinitely a great place to start for any\nGodspeed fans who have never got\nround to listening. I probably wouldn\u2019t\nrecommend it to people who aren\u2019t\nfamiliar with Godspeed, mostly because I\u2019d be too busy recommending F#A#\u221e, but this is great, and the\nfact that I\u2019ve fallen victim to my own\nopening sentence doesn\u2019t change that.\nStuart Masson reviews the Godspeed side project\u2019s latest album\nT\nara Jane O\u2019Neil is a multi-talented musician based\nout of Portland, Oregon.\nAt the age of 19 she was\nalready playing bass for\nart punk band Rodan. She then\nwent about forming Retsin, a folky\nindie duo and The Sonora Pine, a\nmore experimental post-rock type\nband. Since then there has been a\ncollaboration with legendary slowcore\nband Ida, a wide range of guest\nappearances and even a prominent\nrole in the film Half-Cocked. She is\nalso a notable painter. (I did say multi-talented!)\nTara has been releasing solo albums\nsince 2000\u2019s Peregrine. Where Shine\nNew Lights is her seventh solo album\nand it\u2019s a really beautiful\nlisten. It\u2019s certainly a\nlong way from art punk,\nwith the arrangements\nhere generally relying\non a few instruments\nplayed pretty quietly.\nIt veers from Julianna\nBarwick-esque choral\nambient (in particular\non the opening track\nWelcome) through to\nreally tender folk pieces.\nThe Lull the Going is\na particular highlight.\nmatching a picked\nguitar with some quite\nfabulous harmonies.\nElemental Finding opens\nwith a vibraphone before opening out\ninto a dark folky number.

Round, in a Room.\nFound. is almost hypnotic with\na busy beat underneath sparse\ninstrumentation and virtually\nlyricless vocals. The slowly\nrepeated synth in All Now\nVibe transforms it into a really\nspectacular listen, whilst the\nfinal track, New Lights for a Sky\nadds a dissonant edge to the\npretty ambient feel that works\nan absolute treat.\nThere are a few tracks here\nwhich remind me of other\nTara Jane O\u2019Neil - Where Shine New Lights\nStuart Masson\nMusic Editor\nmore prominent singer-songwriters.\nThe aforementioned Julianna Barwick\ncomparison is definitely one that\nkeeps coming back to me, St. Vincent\nis an obvious touchstone on This\nMorning Glory and there\u2019s even a\ntouch of EMA, especially in the first\nhalf of Wordless in Woods.\nThis is a really great listen. A\nwonderful collaboration of ambient\nand folk; this is the perfect remedy\nfor all the stresses of student life. It\u2019s\nnot the most exciting listen, but that\u2019s\npretty much the point. It\u2019s relaxing,\nit\u2019s comforting and it really does go\ndown easily. This is defnitely one I\u2019d\nrecommend to all.\nMatthew Okenyi\n\n"

    "content": "10 FRIDAY 17 JAN\nEditors: Philippa Skett,\nKeir Little, Fiona Hartley\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSCIENCE\nDenial on ice: the polar vortex of confusion\nPhilippa Skett discusses the views of the global warming deniers in the USA\nandhrawisheshgallery.blogspot.co.uk\nThe Niagara Falls rendered stationary by the cold front of the Polar Vortex\nT\nhe polar vortex that swept\nacross North America\nthis holiday was one that\nleft both the ground and\npoliticians rather frosty,\nalbeit for different reasons.\nAs the temperatures dropped and\nice hardened across the country,\nmore and more famous faces\nappeared across the media denying\nglobal warming. Many justified their\narguments by pointing out what they\nconsidered to be the obvious: how can\nwe be causing global warming when it\nis just so cold?\n200 million people were affected\nby the snow storm that plunged\ntemperatures to as low as -12\u00b0\nC in\nChicago last week, with over a dozen\ndeaths reported as a direct result of\nthe weather. The Niagara Falls were\nbrought to an icy standstill, schools\nand workplaces across the country\nwere closed and thousands of flights\nwere grounded. The economic impact\nthe storm had was estimated at\naround $5 billion.\nThe cause of the cold was the\nbreakdown of the Arctic polar vortex.\nPolar vortices are actually persistent\ncyclones permanently located at the\ngeographical poles of the Earth. They\nare cold-core, low pressure areas of\nthe stratosphere that are caused by the\ndifferences in temperatures between\nthe equator and the poles, and span\naround 1,000 km in size.\nThe breakdown was triggered\nby a sudden temperature increase\nin the polar stratosphere, causing\nthe westerly winds of the vortex to\nreverse due to alterations in the usual\npressure differences. The vortex\nspread southward, outward beyond its\nusual confines of the Arctic Circle to\nencompass Northern Europe as well\nas North America, with cold fronts\nbeing felt as far south as Florida.\nDespite the localised effects being a\ndecrease in temperature, the overall\nshift of the polar vortex may have\nactually been an example, albeit\ncounterintuitive, of global warming\nin action, something concurrent with\nthe consensus on climate change\ntaken by the scientific community.\nA recent study looked at papers\npeer-reviewed and published about\nthe climate in the past year, and found\nthat out of 2259 articles, from 9136\nauthors, only one of those scientists\ndid not believe global warming to\nbe a reality. However, this pales in\ncomparison to the numbers of people\nfrom both the mainstream US media\nand politics who also deny global\nwarming in the wake of the arctic\nweather conditions.\nDonald Trump, the well-known\nAmerican investor and real state\nentrepreneur, the stateside equivalent\nof Sir Alan Sugar on The Apprentice,\nand rumoured presidential candidate\nfor 2016, took to twitter to say this of\nthe USA\u2019s cold snap:\nThe Fox News website, never one\nto stay out of an argument, chose its\nside of the debate by publishing an\nopinion piece by Matt Patterson, the\nsenior editor at the Capital Research\nCenter, stating that \u201cglobal warming is\nthe most widespread mass hysteria in\nour species\u2019 history.\u201d\nOthers decided to link those\nconsidering global warming to be a\nreality as deluded as those who believe\nthat Jesus will not return in some sort\nof glorious second coming:\nMeanwhile, Republican Sen. James\nInhofe of Oklahoma, who once built\nan igloo in his garden labelled \u201cAl\nGore\u2019s new home,\u201d stated that climate\nchange is apparently a harmless act of\nGod, and stated that the polar vortex\nbreakdown was further evidence that\nglobal warming is a \u201choax.\u201d\nHe went on to interrupt a debate\nover unemployment insurance in\nSenate last week, to offer up the\nseemingly relevant insight that it\u2019s\n\u201ca little bit humorous to me that\nwe are talking about extending\nunemployment benefits in the midst\nof one of the most intense cold fronts\nin American history\u2026It has to make\neveryone question\u2026whether global\nwarming was ever real.\u201d Such words\nresonated with particular discomfort\ndue to the fact that Inhofe is currently\na ranking member of the Senate\nEnvironment and Public Works\nCommittee.\nIn fact, over one hundred state\nrepresentatives have been on the\nrecord denying global warming, whilst\n24 Senate members have also voiced\ndistrust in what is universally accepted\nby the scientific community. Some of\nthe more damning quotes\nmade by these politicians\ninclude:\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any real\nscience to say we are\naltering the climate path\nof the earth.\u201d (Sen. Roy\nBlunt)\n\u201c[Scientists] are making\nup their facts to fit their\nconclusions. They\u2019ve\nalready caught them doing\nthis,\n\u201d (Sen. Rand Paul)\n\u201cI do not think the science clearly\nsupports global warming theory.\n\u201d (Sen.\nDavid Vitter)\n\u201cGlobal warming has not been\nproven to the satisfaction of the\nconstituents I seek to serve.\n\u201d (Rep. Trey\nGowdy)\nOther politicians may agree with\nthe scientific community, but still\nstruggle to see the importance of\nclimate change, or simply flounder\nwhen formulating intelligent opinions\non the matter. Louisiana Sen. Mary\nLandrieu has previously\nurged President Obama\nto stop the Democratic\nParty focussing on climate\nchange entirely, whilst\nMinnesota Rep. Collin\nPeterson stated that global\nwarming will be good for\nfarmer\u2019s crops, as the\nwarmer weather will allow\nthem to grow more corn.\nLuckily those with the\nultimate power were\nquick to step in on the\ndebate. Obama\u2019s science advisor John\nHoldren stated in a two minute video\nin a blog released by the White House\non Wednesday that \u201cIf you\u2019ve been\nhearing that extreme cold spells like\nthe one we\u2019re having in the United\nStates now disprove global warming,\ndon\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nThe blog went on to say that \u201c\u2026This\nweek\u2019s cold spell is of a type there\u2019s\nreason to believe may become more\nfrequent in a world that\u2019s getting\nwarmer, on average, because of\ngreenhouse-gas pollution.\u201d\nEncouragingly, the White House\nhas also arranged a Google+ hangout\ntoday (Friday the 17th) to publically\ndebunk claims that the harsh winter\nspell was proof that climate change\ndoes not exist. The discussion,\ncalled \u201cWe the Geeks,\u201d will feature\ngovernment officials and independent\nscientists in a final bid to push back\nagainst the climate change deniers\nthat have been allowed such a grand\nplatform in the American mainstream\nmedia.\nAlthough this may raise further\nconcerns around why the most\npowerful people in the USA are\nusing dysfunctional social media\nconstructs to debate international\nissues, it is a positive step forward.\nIt is also a step that not only shows\nthat the US government is ignoring\nthe incorrect opinions of Trump and\nothers, but adds to the greater efforts\nthe US government is finally taking to\ncounteract global warming.\nObama recently introduced the\nGlobal Climate Change Initiative,\noutlining the promise to invest\nmore in technologies aiding climate\nadaptation whilst simultaneously\nreducing emissions, and also ensuring\nthe sustainability of economic growth\nin climate sensitive sectors.\nThe Secretary of State, John Kerry\nhas always been passionate about\nclimate change too; after he negotiated\nan agreement with China to stop\nhydrofluorocarbon usage, he plans\nto aid the implementation of a new\nclimate treaty in 2015 that will commit\nthe USA, and others, to significantly\nreduce fossil fuel pollution.\nWith US economics driven by oil\nand coal it is easy to see why those\nwho benefit from fossil fuel sales\nmost may turn a blind eye or even\ndeny the long-term effects of fossil\nfuel burning. However, no amount of\ntweets, debates or comment pieces\nare going to discredit the increasing\nscientific evidence that global\nwarming is a very real, and a very\ndamaging phenomenon.\nIt seems that this polar vortex\nbrought with it not only a front of\nicy winds and snowy storms, but also\na new wave of scientific ignorance\nwithin the depths of American politics\nthat, if not addressed, will persist long\nafter the Niagara Falls begin to flow\nonce more.\nhttp://heritageaction.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/\nObama is tackling climate change with his Global Climate Change Initiative\n\n"

    "content": "11\nFRIDAY 17 JAN\nFelixScience\n@Scifelix\nSCIENCE\nMaybe you should sleep on it...\nMatilda Hay looks at new research on sleep and memory consilidation\nD\nid you, like everyone else,\nvow to get more sleep\nthis year? Sleeping is\ncommon to all animals\nand a vital part of staying\nhealthy and alert. However, when we\nsleep we are missing opportunities to\nbe more productive, and by switching\noff we leave ourselves vulnerable to\nattack.\nIt must be a very important process\nto be worth all of these risks but what\nis actually happening while we sleep?\nWhen we learn something new,\nconnections between the synapses\ninvolved are strengthened so that\nthe learned pathway will be activated\nmore easily next time. This is the basis\nof memory.\nSleep is known to be important for\nconsolidating short-term memories\ninto long term memories, and it used\nto be thought that we did this by\nreplaying and strengthening those\nconnections during our sleep.\nHowever, sleep experts at Wisconsin\nUniversity have challenged the\ntheory that sleeping strengthens\nthe connections in our brain. Drs\nTononi and Cirelli propose a \u2018synaptic\nhomeostasis hypothesis\u2019 (SHY) which\nsuggests that sleep is important for\nweakening the connections in our\nbrain, and resetting the synapses back\nto normal (hence the reference to\nhomeostasis).\nHowever, if we are resetting all\nour synaptic connections, how do\nwe remember anything? They study\nshows that significant learning\nNeuron connections strengthen or weaken to consolidate memories during sleep, ensuring we remember what matters most\nhttp://sackler.tufts.edu/\nexperiences are dampened less than\ntrivial experiences; overall those\nconnections will be stronger relative\nto the rest. This also helps to explain\nthe phenomena of \u2018smart forgetting\u2019\nwhere our brain rids itself of\nunimportant details that accumulate\neach day.\nBut why would our brains need\nto reset? One reason is an energy\nbenefit. To transmit a signal across\na synapse neurons must release\nchemical neurotransmitters.\nStronger connections release more\nneurotransmitters and this requires\nmore energy. By dampening down\nall of our synaptic connections we\nreduce the energy demands on the cell\nwithout losing the relative strength of\nthe signal.\nAnother reason has to do with the\nfact that nerve cells are essentially\nbinary \u2013 either they fire an impulse\nor they don\u2019t. They will only fire an\nimpulse when they are stimulated\nabove a certain threshold level, either\nby other neurons or by sensory inputs.\nIf the synaptic connection is made\nstronger between two neurons then\nless of a stimulus is required to trigger\nthe threshold in the receiving neuron.\nThis means that old learning would\ndrown out possible new connections\nand interfere with our ability to learn\nnew things.\nThe new SHY hypothesis helps to\nanswer several questions that the\n\u2018active strengthening\u2019 hypothesis\ncouldn\u2019t. Essentially the old idea\nwas that while asleep, \u2018replays\u2019 of\nrecent waking activity patterns in the\nsynapses would \u2018instruct\u2019 learning.\nBut these replays have been seen\nto occur while we are awake, so why\nwould sleep be so necessary? If there\nare also many other spontaneous\nfirings that occur, how does our\nsleeping brain distinguish these from\ngenuine replays? Furthermore, replays\nduring sleep decline rapidly after\nthe first hour. If their purpose is to\nstrengthen our memory then why do\nthey fade so quickly?\nWith the SHY hypothesis, a feedback\nmethod has been proposed so that\nas the neurons fire spontaneously\nthrough the night, the stronger\nconnections preserve themselves and\nare dampened less than weak ones.\nThis explains how the learning could\nbe easily preserved.\nTononi and Cirelli have taken into\naccount evidence from behavior,\nphysiological studies and computer\nsimulations too, and so far their\nhypothesis looks promising. However\nthey have acknowledged that it could\nbe wrong, particularly if we find out\nthat synaptic resetting could occur\nwhile we are awake. For example,\nhaving only some circuits of our brain\nengaged on a task and the \u2018offline\u2019 ones\nresetting themselves would suggest\nthat something else important is going\non while we sleep, something that\ncannot occur whilst we are awake.\nThis study is just one of many that\nis looking at the reasons behind why\nwe sleep, and there are still lots of\nunresolved mysteries as to why we\nneed our recommended eight hours\na night.\nHowever, according to the Great\nBritish Sleep Survey 2012 most of\nus are only averaging 5.1 hours, so if\nreading this hasn\u2019t sent you to sleep\nyet, go and get an early night!\nHypervelocity stars discovered trying to escape the galaxy\nEmma Wills\nScience Writer\n20 candidates for a new type of\nhypervelocity star have been\nannounced by an international team\nof astronomers.\nThese are stars travelling fast enough\nto completely escape our galaxy\u2019s\ngravitational field, which means\ntravelling at more than six hundred\nkilometres per second relative to the\ngalaxy.\nPreviously discovered hypervelocity\nstars are thought to have been\naccelerated by the supermassive black\nhole at our galactic centre, but the\nnewly announced stars appear to be\ntravelling in all directions, none of\nthem from the centre of the galaxy.\nNeither do they seem to have come\nfrom the black hole of our closest large\ngalactic neighbour, the Andromeda\ngalaxy.\nPossible mechanisms for their\nspeed include a binary system where\none of the stars goes supernova and\nejects its companion, or a single star\nthat encounters a binary pair of black\nholes. It is hoped that observations of\ntheir spectra may give clues to their\norigin.\nThe candidates were identified\nby the Sloan Sky Survey, and were\nspotted by looking at their angular\nspeed relative to the centre of the\ngalaxy, which had not been focused\non before. This method can come with\nlarge errors, but a number of statistical\ntests were run to check the accuracy of\nthe velocities.\n\u201cWe think that although some of\nour candidates may\nbe flukes, the majority\nare real\u201d, said Lauren\nPalladino, the lead\nauthor of the paper.\nAn additional puzzle\ncomes from the size of\nthese stars \u2013 they are\nall much smaller than\nthe hypervelocity stars\nknown to come from\nthe galactic centre.\nIf the theory of the\npreviously discovered\nhypervelocity stars\nis correct, then there\nshould be a range of\nsizes of star ejected\nfrom the centre of our\ngalaxy.

But all of this is\nchanging, fast.\nTempest is the latest winner of the\nTed Hughes Award for innovation in\npoetry, with her new piece Brand New\nAncients, a poem-story-play combo\ncurrently touring some of the most\nprolific venues in London and the UK.\nStanding on the candle-lit stage of\nSt. Leonard\u2019s Church in Shoreditch,\nbefore a quartet of musicians playing a\nscore composed by the award-winning\nNeil Catchpole, she announces that\nthis is a piece about \u201ca world beyond\nthe immediate, beyond trainers and\nnice clothes; about the forgotten. It\nis about empathy, love, and courage,\nwhich for humans are the most\nimportant, and should be cultivated\nin us all.\u201d\nDo not be misled, however. As\nemotional and tense as it is, Brand\nNew Ancients is not a soppy affair.\nEven prior to the meanings of her\nwords being fully realised, before\nher poetic majesty is registered and\ncauses a pause for thought, Tempest\u2019s\npresence is truly a storm, which eyes\nor thoughts cannot wander from.\nShe describes it herself as an epic\nnarrative poem \u2013 a story that brings\nback the mythology of old tales in the\nform of the everyday people that get\nup and go to work. Indeed, her chorus\nrepeatedly chimes of them as \u201cThe\nGods\u201d doing this or that in various\nguises.\nHer story of two families with young\nchildren that fall apart, get together,\nfind themselves and each other in a\nmodern setting is not an unfamiliar\none. The unique aspect is the\ncelebration of the everyday, though\nan extreme version for those who may\nnot be acquainted with the infamous\nviolence of her hometown, which no\ndoubt grounds the basis of her work.\nThe way in which the story unwinds\nis also evidently influenced by her\nplay-writing. As she narrates, clear\nimages of the events are formed in\nthe mind with a backdrop of dramatic\nmusic, as visual as though watching a\nfilm.\nDespite all this, the wittiest part\nwas her silence, as the violin played\nas a manifestation of two young lovers\nkissing for the first time. Sweet. \u201cI\ntake great inspiration from something\nthat makes me feel,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf\nsomething speaks to you through the\nages then that\u2019s the most important\nthing in bringing us closer to each\nother and ourselves.\u201d This also true of\nher own work; as was demonstrated\nby the standing ovation she received\nat the end of her performance.\nAlthough nothing would come close\nto experiencing Kate Tempest other\nthan watching her speak her poems\nbefore you, Brand New Ancients is\navailable in book form for those who\ntake enjoyment in perusing beautifully\nlaid-out phrases for more than a\nfleeting moment.\nKate Tempest: Brand New Ancients\nis touring now until 20th April. See\nbit.ly/1fyfaXZ for more information.\nAll-male Swan Lake makes ballet history\nClara Clark Nevola\nWriter\nWhat: Matthew Bourne\u2019s Swan Lake\nWhere: Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1\nWhen: Until 26th January\nPrice: Various\nD\nance newbies: this is not\nfrilly dresses and satin\nshoes. You will be exposed\nto raw power, unsettling\nemotions and unsettling\nscenes. Ballet aficionados: prepare to\nbe amazed at the side of Swan Lake\nthis performance brings out.\nSet to Tchaikovsky\u2019s music for Swan\nLake, one of the most loved and most\nperformed classical ballets, Matthew\nBourne\u2019s production created great\ncontroversy. And yet, 18 years from\npremiere, every tour sells out \u2013 a\ntestament to its truly unique impact.\nThe performance revolutionises Swan\nLake as a performance, while sticking\nfaithfully to the musical score.\nAt the centre of the dance, replacing\nthe traditional figure of Odette, the\nfragile princess turned swan, is the\nPrince and the Swan. The former\n(Simon Williams) is timid, insecure\nand alone, the latter a powerful, vital,\nextraordinary creature, filled with\nmystery, masculinity and strength.\nJonathan Ollivier brings an almost\nfrightening power to this role,\ncommanding the hearts and emotions\nof the Prince and the audience in a\nway rarely seen on stage.\nScorned by his frigid, fashionable\nmother, the Prince drifts through his\nroyal duties, distracted and sorrowful.\nEscaping the strict, sterile geometry\nof his castle, he discovers passion,\nsexuality and life in a grimy bar\ndowntown. This is when his life starts\nintertwining with the swans, creating\nscenes with an almost hallucinatory\natmosphere, between reality and\nvisions. Masculine, powerful, violent,\nhauntingly beautiful and utterly non-human, the swans appear repeatedly\nto the Prince. First hostile, then almost\nwithin reach, with the lead Swan by\nturns beckoning and aggressive.\nThis interpretation is inspired: the\nside of a swan we all know exists. Yes,\nswans are graceful and pretty, like the\niconic female tutu-clad swans of Swan\nLake. But they are also powerful,\nwild, ruthless and unreachable, as\nare Matthew Bourne\u2019s half naked,\nmuscular men with shaved heads \u2013\nalluring and terrifying.\nThe performance continues in an\nincreasingly frenzied setting, as the\nPrince\u2019s obsession with the Swan\ngrows. Ollivier takes the role of the\nStranger, the Black Swan/Odile of\ntraditional Swan Lakes, and appears\nin sexy black leather at a palace ball.\nTantalising the Prince by scorning\nhis affections in public, the Stanger\ndances provocatively with all the\nwomen at the ball. And yet the\nemotional tension between him and\nthe Prince is palpable \u2013 can this lady\u2019s\nman really be the same wild and heartbreaking creature of the Prince\u2019s night\ntime encounters?\nThe genius of this production does\nnot lie in reimagining a well-known\nromantic ballet as a modern, male\ncouple dance, though the homoerotic\ntensionhasgotmanytongueswagging.\nNor does it lie in choreographing a\njazz routine to Tchaikovsky soaring\nscore, though this is an impressive\nachievement.\nThe reason for which this\nperformance is, and will remain, a key\nproduction in the dance repertoire is\nthat it shows us what a classical ballet\nis for. Not for tutus, not for repertoire\nsteps and revered, un-modifiable\ncanons. Ballet is not even for pointe\nshoes or scenes of pretty heroines\nagainst ungainly baddies. A real dance\nproduction will stir dark, buried\nemotions inside you. It will make you\nlong for those wild and unharnessed\nfeelings described by the music and\nincarnated in the dance.\nThere has not been a new\nperformance of this kind since early\ntwentieth century Paris, and Matthew\nBourne, a fifty year old east Londoner,\nhas created something worthy of\nballetic history.\nspitalfields music festival\nBILL COOPER\n\n"

    "content": "15\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 17 JAN\nARTS\nHow an educational charity is bringing\nart back to the masses\nP\nresent education policy\nseems to be driven by the\npolitical notion that culture\nshould be seen as a \u2018luxury\u2019\nand a \u2018commodity\u2019, and\npurely in terms of economic utility. In\nApril 2013, arts secretary Maria Miller\nspoke on the subject of British arts,\nsaying that the argument for continued\narts funding must be made primarily\non economic grounds, so that it \u201cwill\nget traction, not in the press, but with\nmy colleagues \u2013 and with the country\nat large\u201d.\nMeanwhile the reforms to university\ntuition fees that came into force\nin 2012 have had a profound and\ndevastating impact on the arts across\nthe UK. Students are applying to study\nvocational subjects rather than take\nthe gamble and end up with a degree\nthat will leave them up to \u00a336,000 in\nthe red.\n\u201cThe government is emphasising\nthat culture is a luxury we can\u2019t afford,\u201d\nsaid campaigner and fundraiser Neil\nGriffiths, speaking at the one day\nconference at Central Saint Martins\nCollege of Arts and Design entitled\n\u2018What\u2019s the Point of Art School?\u2019 in\nMay 2013. This idea is reiterated by\naward winning comedian Josie Long,\nwho believes the liberal arts have\nbeen side-lined by a government that\nsees higher education as a means to\nemployability rather than an end in\nitself.\nArts Emergency Service is a\ngrassroots project co-founded by\nGriffiths and Long in 2011. It aims\nto reverse the trend by \u201cgathering a\nnationalnetworkofvolunteerstocreate\nprivilege for people without privilege\nand counter the myth that university,\nand in particular arts degrees, are the\ndomain of the privileged.\u201d\nLong, who won a place to study\nEnglish at Oxford despite coming from\na family with \u2018no connections\u2019 and\nmodest means says that studying the\narts \u2018changed her life\u2019. She is passionate\nabout giving underprivileged children\na chance to explore creative careers\nand the benefits that it can bring. The\nproject primarily runs the \u2018Alternative\nOld Boys\u2019 Network\u2019, subverting the\ntradition of alumni from elite schools\nand universities helping each other to\nget a leg up in the jobs market. The\nAlternative Old Boys\u2019 Network gathers\nhundreds of volunteers working in\nfine art, theatre, media, comedy,\ndesign and more to provide mentoring\nservices. Amongst volunteers from the\nmembers of the public, an impressive\nlist of big names are also involved;\npatrons include the journalists Polly\nToynbee and Laurie Penny, artist\nduo Jake & Dinos Chapman, authors\nNeil Gaiman and Alan Moore, poet\nScroobius Pip, and comedians Stephen\nK Amos, Stewart Lee and Shappi\nKhorsandi. Mentors need not even\nhave an arts degree; they include\nscientists, public sector workers and\nself-trained artists, the only common\nfactor being their passion for arts\neducation and keeping the door open\nfor students from all backgrounds.\nMentors work with student\nmembers aged 16-19 in further\neducation to help pursue a personal\ngoal and explore their options in the\narts, media, academia and professions\nsuch as Law and Architecture. They\nare given the opportunity to meet\nuseful people from the network,\nand give themselves a foundation of\nconfidence and connections on which\nto build a successful future \u2013 on their\nown terms. Mentors meet students\nface to face, talk on the phone or\nemail offering information, advice and\nguidance relevant to their experience.\nMany also offer work experience,\ntaster days and further access to others\nin their personal networks. According\nto Arts Emergency the program has\nfound considerable success in the pilot\nscheme; each student member that\njoined is now studying at university or\nis the process of applying. \u2018Graduates\u2019\nof the scheme are offered on-going\npractical support in the longer term\nthrough access to the network.\nSpeaking to the Guardian in 2011,\nLong said that the \u201cultimate aim\u201d of\nArts Emergency Service is \u201cto reinstate\nfree education for all at a tertiary level.\u201d\nAs well as running the mentoring\nscheme, Arts Emergency are involved\nactively in the community by running\nworkshops in schools and sixth\nform colleges to \u2018de-mystify\u2019 creative\ncareers. Members also speak regularly\nat public events; Josie Long appeared\nalongside author Phillip Pullman and\nworld-renowned graphic novelist and\nmagician Alan Moore at the 2013\nOxford Literary Festival to discuss\n\u2018what\u2019s the point of the arts?\u2019 and\nwhether the arts and humanities can\nsurvive in times of economic hardship.\nIn addition to positive propaganda,\nin order of raise money for the\narts education cause, in 2014 Arts\nEmergency will run the \u2018Student Debt\nLottery\u2019 in which winners get some\nand possibly all of their debts paid off.\nIronically, the government\u2019s\nwithdrawal of support for humanities\nhigher education is likely to prove to\nbe a short sighted decision. The July\n2013 report \u2018Humanities Graduates\nand the British Economy: The Hidden\nImpact\u2019 conducted by the University\nof Oxford has found that 80% of all\nOxford humanities graduates go on\nto be employed by key economic\ngrowth sectors such as finance, law,\nmedia, and education. This trend is\nalmost universal across universities.\nEmployment trends indicate clearly\nthat Humanities higher education is\nnot a disadvantage for graduates in a\nhighly competitive economy; in fact\nthe creativity, literate, critical, and\ncommunication skills that have long\nbeen the core of Humanities-based\nhigher education have proven appeal\nto employers.\nIn lieu of government funding, the\nmantle of keeping the arts alive seem\nto have fallen to charities such as Arts\nEmergency, and if successful, its work\nand the work of similar projects will no\ndoubt be claimed as a victory for the\n\u2018Big Society\u2019 in operation by the Tories\nin the years to come. Meanwhile the\npublic can support the Arts Emergency\nService by joining up to be a mentor or\ndonating at their website: www.arts-emergency.org\nArts Emergency!\nAlan Moore, Josie Long and Philip Pullman at the Oxford Literary Festival,\ndiscussing \u2018What\u2019s the point of arts and humanities?\u201d\nHipster German\nexpressionism\nClara Clark Nevola\nWriter\nWhat: From Morning to Midnight\nWhere: National Theatre, SE1\nWhen: Until 26th January\nPrice: Various\nS\no here you are. You\u2019ve\nwatched all the Salvador\nDali films in the house,\nknitted all the hipster\nbeanies you need, the bars\nin Shoreditch are too mainstream on a\nFriday night and you\u2019ve already spent\nhours listening to unknown bands\non Soundcloud. So what next? Well,\nyou get yourself a ticket for a German\nexpressionist play at the National\nTheatre, obvs.\nSo if this is your plan, let me talk you\nthrough the pros and cons.\nFirst pro is that you\u2019re unlikely to see\nit again for a long time: From Morning\nto Midnight, Georg Kaiser\u2019s masterwork has not had much airing since\nits premiere in 1917. Basically, now\u2019s\nyour chance.\nSecondly, and this is quite a major\none, taking the lead role as the Clerk\nis Adam Godley. Doesn\u2019t ring a bell?\nCharlie\u2019s dad in the 2005 Charlie\nand the Chocolate Factory film, Elliot\nSchwartz in Breaking Bad, he\u2019s been in\nheaps of TV and theatre. Nominated\nmultiple times for the Oliver Award\nand winner of numerous other\nawards, Godley is basically the only\nactor in the cast who got what the play\nwas about. Oh wait, that\u2019s a spoiler \u2013\nmore of in the cons. Anyway, Godley\nreally brings the existentialist angst to\nthis performance. Playing the boring,\nmiddle-aged clerk with a repetitive\nlife and a repetitive job, he evolves as\na character from his infatuation for a\ntravelling Italian lady to his quest to\nfind the meaning of life. In a 24 hour\nwhirl, he tries out the thrills of life,\nlooking for meaning in adrenaline,\ndebauchery and religion. Comic but\ntragic, the clerk is self-aware of his\nfailings and yet desperate to discover\nan underlying truth \u2013 the epitome of\nthe expressionist hero.\nNextup,allpraisetoSoutraGilmour,\nthe stage designer. This really makes\nthe production stand out, creating\nsurreal and often disquieting sets,\nframing and highlighting the spiritual\nangst which the play conveys. In many\nways, the stage design speaks more\nthan the actual cast, and certainly\nmore convincingly. A giant clock\ntowers over the stage, a reminder of\nthe limited time that the clerk, and\nindeed everyone, has left. Below, the\npeople scurry in pursuit of pointless\nactivities and empty pleasures. The\nthrill of a bike race is marvellously\nrendered, the excitement of a nonexistent crowd palpable. Bed sheets\nturn to snow and snow to waves as\nthe clerk goes on his journey form his\ndomestic repetition to the urban life\noutside. Houses collapse, lightning\nstrikes, banks are robbed \u2013 this is all\ndone seamlessly, with props being\nreused inventively to create a dream\nlike stage geometry. All is set to almost\nconstant refrain from Wagner\u2019s\nTannhouser., which sometimes works\nand sometimes doesn\u2019t, but definitely\nadds to the overall angst of the viewer.\nAnd now for the negatives of this\nproduction. It\u2019s hollow, it\u2019s predictable\nand it\u2019s flat.\nThe overall production is striking\nand impressive \u2013 but overwhelming.\nThe constant flashes, music and stage\nsurprises, though wonderful and\ningenious, do nothing to improve your\ninterest in the clerk\u2019s fate. Is he going\nto find the meaning of life in religion?\nIs he going to get caught? Will he go\nback to his previous lifestyle? You just\ndon\u2019t care. And the truth is none of the\ncast members seem to either. With the\nnotable exception of Godley, no one\nseems to have got into their part, or\neven be aware that their lines are part\nof a dialogue.\nAll in all, a trip to From Morning to\nMidnight may be better than another\nevening polishing your fixed gear bike,\nbut only just.\nJOHAN PERSSON\nIndira Mallik\nWriter\nARTS EMERgency\n\n"

Now after\nthreat of court action by Kanye West, the creators of the coin have been\nforced to change its name, as well as asked to hand over their website.\nNow further controversy has been added, by the fact that the Coinye coin\nhas folded completely due to continued legal threats by the West Estate.\nConsumer Electronics Show\nThe Consumer Electronics Show\n(CES) is an annual technology and\nconsumer products show held every\nJanuary in Las Vegas. Being the global\nstage that attracts next generation\ninnovations and electronics, CES is\nthe largest of its kind, showcasing\nover 3000 exhibitors from computer\nhardwaremanufacturestoautomotive\nandlifestyleelectronicsmanufactures.\nThe CES really is the hub for rising\ntechnologies, not only attracting\nbig names such as LG and Intel\nbut also emerging innovators and\nstart-ups that are keen to make\ntheir new products stand out.\nThe Occulus Rift, a virtual reality\ngaming head-set, made its mark at\nlast year\u2019s 2013 CES show making\nvirtual reality buffs insist that we\nare ever closer to a next generation\nof gaming, all virtual. In 2014, the\ndeveloper Occulus brought about\nmore improvements to their original\ndesign in the latest prototype,\nCrystal Cove. Enhancements, such\nas carefully placed LEDs on the\nski-goggle like design has added\nto the headset positional tracking\ntechnology, greatly reducing motion\nblur and hence the need to vomit\nevery time you peep around that\ncorner to get a better view of the\nenemy. The new external camera\nprovides upper body tracking,\nenabling the user to lean, turn and\ncrane their neck as they please,\ngiving a truly \u2018immersive\u2019 experience.\nWith $75 million in new funding\nwe can expect to see a lot from\nOcculus Rift. The Crystal Cove\nprototype that was seen in CES\nis by no means a finished version\nwith upcoming improvements in\nresolution and camera quality.\nThe Galaxy NotePro, Samsung\u2019s\nnewest note tablet, comes with\na 12.2 inch screen, widget based\ninterface and premium specs. What\u2019s\ninnovative about this new tablet is\nthat it leaves behind the traditional\nandroid user interface, TouchWiz,\ngoing for a more widget based\ngraphical feel. Utilising Samsung\u2019s\nnewest Magazine UX interface has\nallowed a much more immediate\naccess of apps and information.\nThe specs of the NotePro are,\nin short, nothing but a premium\nselection of hardware. With a\nQualquam Snapdragon 800 quad\ncore processor at 2.3GHz per core\nand a built in GPU that delivers\nup to a 50% increase in graphics\nperformance, users can expect a much\nfaster and better performing tablet\nwhen it comes to multitasking and\nrunning taxing apps. The screen has\na 2560x1600 resolution, delivering\nsharp images. The rear camera is at\n8-megapixels with LED flash while\nthe front has a two megapixel camera.\nAfter showing off the NotePro\nat CES, the success of this product\nwill depend on Samsung\u2019s new\nMagazine UX and how customers\nreact to it, so far the feedback on\nthe new UI has been positive and it\u2019s\ngood to see that Samsung is doing\nsomething different rather than just\nintroducing another android tablet.\nAudi A7 demonstrated its\nautomated vehicle technology at\nthis year\u2019s CES. Being still under\ndevelopment we can expect to see\nautomated driving in the not too\ndistant future. This technology is\naimed at automating the car when it\u2019s\ndriving below 40kmph to give drivers\n\u2018a break\u2019 by using its forward-looking\nradars and laser to detect the traffic in\nfront. Moreover, a camera mounted\non the windshield is used to detect\nlane lines to keep the car in its lane and\na rear radar to detect upcoming cars\non either side. All of these sensors and\ndetectors work together in harmony\nto provide the car\u2019s computer with all\nthe information it needs to control the\nbrakes, steering wheel and accelerator.\nAutonomous driving is not a new\nconcept or even a new technology,\nbut what Audi managed to do is\nbring automated driving closer to\nthe consumer market place. If you\ncompare the Audi A7 with Google\u2019s\nfamous autonomous cars with their\nlarge mounted roof detectors, the\nA7 has its gear neatly hidden in\nthe bodywork still giving the car\nits distinctive aesthetic Audi look.\nPerhaps the most awkward part of\nCES 2014 was Transformers director\nMichal Bay\u2019s supposed Samsung Talk\nthat ended up in him leaving the stage\nin front of hundreds of journalists\nand industry professionals due to a\nteleprompter fail. Not knowing what\nto say, Bay walked off the stage with,\n\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u201d, as\nhis final words.

    "content": "6 FRIDAY 17 JAN\nNEWS\nEditors: Aemun Reza,\nNida Mahmud,\nMaciej Matuszewski,\nAamna Mohdin\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nO\nn 14th April 2013\nthe British Union\nfor the Abolition of\nVivisection (BUAV)\npresented Imperial\nCollege London with a report\nthat accumulated a list of various\nallegations of misconduct concerning\nanimal experimentation. The report\ncontained a video produced by the\nundercover investigator, which\nBUAV released to the public, which\npurported to demonstrate a number\nof instances of poor animal welfare\npractices. As a result Imperial College\ncame under national scrutiny, which\ncan be seen on the comments on\nCollege\u2019s social media pages. The\npublic outcry, included Morrissey and\nBrian May, called for an immediate\nindependent inquiry.\nThe BUAV believed the report\nprovided evidence for a violation of\nthe Animal (Scientific Procedures)\nAct 1986 (as amended to incorporate\nthe changes brought in the by the\nEuropean Directive, 2010/63/EU).\nThe act insists that institutions acquire\na personal license, provided by the\nHome Office, in order to practise\nanimal research. The license sets\nout the limitation of each research\nproject according to its categorised\nseverity. The report is thought to have\nhighlighted a number of instances of\npoor animal handling that includes:\nexceeding severity limits; poor\nmonitoring and staff cover; poor\nsurgical practice and anaesthesia;\nadministration of analgesics;\napproaches to the killing of animals.\nIn response, the Home Office began\nan enquiry in the allegations. Imperial\nCollege announced \u201cimmediate\nactions\u201d and invited Professor Steve\nBrown, Medical Research Council\u2019s\nMammalian Genetics Unit, and\nHarwell to chair an independent\ncommittee to investigate and assess\nthe approach to animal care and\nwelfare across the College. Though\nthe college insisted the committee was\nindependent, the Chief Executive of\nthe BUAV Michelle Thew accused this\ninvestigation as a \u201cwhite-wash.\u201d The\norganisation claimed that Professor\nSteve Brown was \u201ca well-known and\nstrong supporter of animal research,\nheading the Medical Research Council\n(MRC) unit which manipulates mice\nto predispose them to develop all\nmanner of diseases, but the MRC\nactually funds animal research at the\nImperial College.\u201d The organisation\nand their supporters (including\nBrian May) petitioned for a different,\nindependent inquiry.\nThe committee convened 6 June,\n2013 and set out to provide a report\nthat described College\u2019s best practises\nregarding animal research, including\nthose that had room for enhancement;\ndelivered detailed recommendations\nfor improvement, and attempted to\nprovide potential solutions, where\npossible. The committee was clear that\nit would not investigate the specific\nallegations made by BUAV. The role\nof the committee was to examine all\naspects of animal experimentation at\nthe College facilities including areas\nsuch as ethical review, operations,\ncompliance,trainingandmanagement.\nThe committee took a mixture of\napproaches which included interviews\nof Imperial personnel, the examination\nof relevant documents requested and\na visit to the animal facility described\nin the BUAV allegations. The\ncommittee found that husbandry and\nmaintenance of facilities was carried\nout to a high standard. Moreover, the\nanimal house staffs were supportive,\ncommitted, engaged, and willing to\ndo more in terms of developing new\napproaches to animal welfare.\nThe committee however concluded\nthat Imperial\u2019s Animal Welfare and\nEthical Review Body (AWERB) was\nnot fit for purpose due to a lack\nfocus on the 3Rs of animal research\n(the replacement, reduction and\nrefinement of animals in research)\nand lack of involvement of scientists.\nThe committee recommended a more\nrigorous process that takes these\nshortcomings into consideration.\nAWERB are required by all research\ninstitutions in the UK. The body\nhas a wide set of responsibilities\nincluding: ensuring animal welfare,\nreviewing the use of animals in\nexperimentation, and discussing the\n3Rs. The implementation of these\nrecommendations will be critical for\nImperial to reach the standards in the\n3Rs.\nIt was found that the local AWERB\nprocess, which was conducted\nelectronically, failed to provide a\nforum for discussions and to deliver\nimprovements in the 3Rs. The local\nAWERB also failed to engage scientists\non a broad basis across Imperial, and\nthus there was very little opportunity\nto discuss and take a substantive and\nactive role in reviewing approaches\nto animal experimentation. The\ncommittee recommend that the\nlocal AWERB process be reformed\nwith the creation of two standing\nDr Silvia Bello\nPalaeoanthropologist\n\u2018They say everyone has\nskeletons in their closet,\nI actually do.\u2019\ncommittees, one at South Kensington/\nSt. Mary\u2019s, the other at Hammersmith.\nThis reformed committee should\nbe compromised of key staff from\nanimal facilities along with scientists,\nand should meet regularly to review\nproject applications with the scientists\nconcerned.\nThe committee also recommended\nreforms for the central AWERB\nprocess, establishing a new role for\nthis forum. The central AWERB\nshould receive reports from the local\nAWERB and discuss strategic and\noperational issues on animal welfare.\nThe central forum is to be chaired\nby a senior faculty member such as a\nDean. Both local and central AWERB\nmeetings should be wider advertised\nand anonymised minutes should be\nmade available.\nThe committee recommended\nan increase in staffing levels and a\nreduction on the reliance on agency\nstaff. They also recommended\nstaff monitor research labs at least\nonce daily, which will contribute to\ncompetency reports of license holders.\nThe BUAV video raised questions\non the training of researchers\nexperimenting on animal research and\nwhether the College\u2019s animal welfare\nofficers were performing their jobs\neffectively. The committee\u2019s training\nand competency assessment found\nthat the training was \u201cad hoc\u201d and the\nmechanisms for sharing information\ncurrently in place were not effective.\nThe committee recommended a\n\u201csignificant increase\u201d for the resources\nallocated to training and competency\nassessment and suggested that this be\naccompanied with the appointment\nof a senior Named Training and\nCompetency Officer (NTCO).\nThe report studied the culture,\nleadership and management of animal\nresearch at Imperial, recommending\nan annual College prize to the team\nthat make outstanding commitment\nor contribution in the development\nof the 3Rs. In addition, the committee\nrecommended the creation of a new\nsenior directorial role that will take\noverall responsibility for the delivery\nof bio-services at Imperial.\nImperial College responded by\npromising \u201cto move quickly to\nimplement the recommendations\u201d\nand stated that there is \u201ca significant\nscope for improvement in aspects\nof the operation, management and\noversight in order to become a world\nleader in animal research.\u201d\nA separate inquiry, undertaken by\nthe Home Office, is expected to be\npublished soon.\nWIKIMEDIA COMMONS\nBrown Report Published\nAamna Mohdin\nNews Editor\n\n"

Russell\nWriters: Eric Singer, David O.\nRussell\nStarring: Christian Bale, Bradley\nCooper, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner,\nJennifer Lawrence\nRuntime: 138 minutes\nCertification: 15\n\u201cThank god for me\u201d, says Rosalyn\nRosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence), after\nsetting fire to her brand new micro-wave, ignoring her husband\u2019s advice\nto not put something metallic in there.\nShe then proceeds to furiously tackle\nsome housework whilst listening to\n\u2018Live and Let Die\u2019. Yes, thank god for\nJennifer Lawrence, who steals the\nshow completely with her utmost confidence and relentless energy in David\nO. Russell\u2019s smart heist comedy that\nis no doubt the director\u2019s best film to\ndate.\nThat\u2019s not to say the rest of the cast\nunder-performs. The big names in this\nstar-studded ensemble, most of whom\nwho have worked with Russell before,\nare all on top form, with even a bonus\ncameo appearance from a screen veteran who makes the most of his brief,\nuncredited appearance in which he\nscares the hell out of everyone by being a smart, bilingual mob boss.\nBased on the ABSCAM (Arab-scam) sting operation in which a\nnumber of corrupt politicians were arrested for taking bribes, we first meet\nIrving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and\nSydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who\nhustle money off of desperate individuals ready to fork over large sums over\nthe promise of massive returns. Everything seems to be going swimmingly\nfor this couple, an arrangement that is\nnot only beneficial financially, but also\nin terms of embarking on a love affair.\nBut their ideal world is shattered when\nFBI Agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley\nCooper) arrests the pair. Giving them\nvery limited options, this ambitious\nFed is looking to take down some of\nthe biggest names he can think of, all\nfor the benefit of his career.\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nThe Railway Man\nDirector: Jonathan Teplitzky\nWriters: Frank Cottrell Boyce, Andy\nPaterson\nStarring: Colin Firth, Nicole Kidman,\nJeremy Irvine, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd\nRuntime: 116 minutes\nCertification: 15\nThe idea behind American Hustle\nis that everyone here is desperate to\nfind their own versions of ideal hap-piness. And to do so what they resort\nto is deception. They lie to others, and\nsometimes lie to themselves. Irving\u2019s\nvolatile, tiresome relationship with his\nwife, Rosalyn, is one that will generate\nthe most laughs, but it\u2019s a relationship\nthat is also the most thought-provok-ing. Irvin and Rosalyn are together for\nvarious reasons, and love barely features in them. And when the truth hits\nher, most devastatingly so when her\nhusband\u2019s mistress Sydney boldly faces off against her, Rosalyn is a vulner-able, teary, insecure mess, a scene for\nwhich Lawrence deserves an Oscar.\nMayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy\nRenner, rocking a retro hairdo that is\ncriminal by today\u2019s standards) is the\nmajor target of Richie\u2019s new opera-From one station of life to the next\ntion, one that is barely approved by his\nagency superior Stoddard Thorsen\n(Louie C.K. in a priceless supporting\nrole). Carmine\u2019s love and dedication\nfor the state of New Jersey is unashamedly used and manipulated by\nthe authorities to bag what they want,\nand in the end it\u2019s difficult to not feel\nsome sort of remorse for an all-round\nenthusiastic family man who wanted\nnothing more than to set a good example to his constituents.\nThe \u201cscam\u201d itself is full of hilarious\nmoments as not everything goes exactly to plan. One of many examples\nof this is having to settle for a Hispanic\nFBI agent to pose as a rich Arabian\nSheik who will be providing all the\nfalse bribe money. The \u201cgood guys\u201d\nare all desperate for their plans to suc-ceed, and it\u2019s in their sincere, earnest\nefforts that the sparks begin to fly and\nthe script starts to have fun with unpredictable twists and turns.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t necessarily in good\nshape, and he had this combover that\nwas rather elaborate, but he had this\nconfidence that drew me to him\u201d says\nSydney in a voiceover that explains\nthe immediate attraction she had for\nher partner in crime. Throwing Richie\ninto the mix and the bubbling sexual\ntension that arises with Sydney in the\nmiddle of it all, constantly flashing her\nside-boobs in her many different out-fits, is a car crash waiting to happen.\nAre Sydney and Irving a steady\nenough couple to survive the cage-rattling by Richie? Is Richie only using\nSydney to gain what he wants? If push\ncomes to shove, will Irving choose\nhis mistress or his wife? Can Irving\nreally betray Carmine who is slowly\nbut surely becoming a good friend of\nhis? Where does Sydney\u2019s heart truly\nlie? Should Rosalyn really be looking\nafter a young son? The classic game of\nwho\u2019s conning whom takes place and\nfor those wanting to get to the very\ntop, security and freedom, difficult decisions must be made and it\u2019s in these\nfascinating characters Russell\u2019s smart,\nsexy heist comedy is made complete.\nAmerican Hustle is an absolute blast\nfrom start to finish and it never lets go\nin terms of gripping the audience with\nits intriguing plot and unique characters caught up in highly entertaining\nscenarios. Released towards the end\nof 2013 in the States, it\u2019s no surprise\nthere\u2019s a lot of awards attention surrounding this, and although it\u2019s way\ntoo early to call it for the 2014 European film market, American Hustle will\nremain as one of 2014\u2019s best.\nIt\u2019s an unbelievably touching story of\nhuman survival, love, and forgiveness.\nYoung Eric Lomax (Jeremy Irvine), a\nprisoner of war when the allies surrendered to the Japanese in Singapore\nduring the Second World War, goes\nthrough gruelling times to say the\nleast when enemy soldiers discover\nhe\u2019s been building a radio and drawing a map. Years after the eventual\nvictory, Lomax (now Colin Firth) has\na chance encounter with Patti (Nicole\nKidman), who later goes on to become\nhis wife. It\u2019s only then the signs of post\ntraumatic stress disorder come to sur-face, which spurs on Mrs Lomax to\nfind some sort of closure for her long-suffering husband.\nWith the help from an old army\nfriend (Stellan Skarsgard) Patti learns\nof the brutal torture and inhumane\ncruelty her husband was subjected\nto. And Kidman, playing a supporting\npart in the first half of the film or so,\nis quietly effective in showing warmth\nand compassion, which is also heartbreaking of sorts, as Patti struggles to\nimprove her husband\u2019s condition.\nFlashbacks reveal the ordeal Lomax went through, something that is\nshown in a lot of beatings, screaming,\nand one scene of water-boarding, although you get the feeling that the film\nis holding a lot back when it comes to\nmethods of torture.\nBut through excellent performances\ncoming from both Firth and Irvine,\nthere is an element of continuity that\npaints Lomax as one person rather\nthan splitting him up into two separate characters to fit into the different\ntimelines.\nLess well executed is when Patti reenters the picture towards the end. In\na clumsy voiceover that attempts to\nfinish off all the loose strands, Lomax\ncredits his wife and their love as being an important influence of good in\nhis life. The thing is, there hasn\u2019t been\na whole lot of Kidman to make that\nstatement convincing.\nThe eventual reunion that takes\nplace between Firth and his torturer\nTakashi Nagase (Hiroyuki Sanada) is a\npowerfully moving and equally tense\nsequence that will rightly get those\ntear-ducts overflowing.\n\n"

In recent years there\nhas been a trend toward British\nuniversities paying relatively high\nwages to incoming American senior\nmanagement staff.\nIn comparison to incumbent\nPresident & Rector Sir Keith O\u2019Nions\u2019\ntotal compensation of \u00a3323,000 in\nthe 2011-12 financial year, Professor\nGast received a total compensation\npackage that year worth \u00a3711,721 (at\ncurrent exchange rates), which lead to\nthe Times Higher Education asking a\ntight-lipped College spokesperson for\nmore information.\nPresident-designate Professor\nGast\u2019s appointment comes after\nrecent structural changes to the\nleadership roles at College which saw\nthe role of Rector being split into two\nseparate roles: President and Provost,\nas announced by College Council\nin April 2012. These roles split the\nresponsibility of the Rector into the\npublic-facing President position,\nwhich is ultimately responsible for\nall College activities and cultivates\nrelationships with the business and\npolitical worlds, and the academia-focused Provost, who reports to the\nPresident and manages College\u2019s\nacademic mission.\nThe new President-designate and\nthe current Provost Professor James\nStirling, former Head of Physics at the\nUniversity of Cambridge are replacing\nthe current President & Rector,\nProfessor Sir Keith O\u2019Nions FRS,\nwho is retiring from the position after\nfour-and-a-half years at Imperial\u2019s top\nposition.

I have several times\nmarked something as completely\nwrong only to realise five minutes\nlater it is a perfect solution and had\nto cross out all my notes. I have also\nhad to start calling my lecturers by\ntheir first names, which is not only\nweird and wrong, but also impossible\nwith people who the other staff refer\nto as Professor. Yet still they insist.\nMost awfully I\u2019ve had to rebound\nchat up lines from students. With\nthe MScs and their older wiser ways\nthis is only vaguely embarrassing but\nby undergrads, who look to me about\n12, it is just awful and not cute as\nmy sister determined in her wails of\nunfeeling laughter.\nBut today did not get off to a good\nstart. I was invigilating an extra time\nexam which had just one student in\nit. These are the best GTA jobs (apart\nfrom the fieldtrips) as you can stay the\nwhole way through the exams, which\ncan be over 4 hours (good cash times\nafter a rather indulgent Christmas).\nYou can also take in your own work.\nThus, you have 4 hours of time alone\nwith your work, with no emails or\npeople or funding proposals, and you\nget paid for it.\nThis sounds pretty ideal until your\nstomach starts rumbling. Very, very\nloudly. Now this is awkward on any\nChristy Kelly thinks now is the winter of our discontent\nConfessions of a GTA: Part Seven\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\nA new and slightly more awkward year\noccasion. I still remember a particular\nprimary school teacher whose\nstomach would always kick off at\naround 12pm, but in a tiny silent room\nwith only one other unknown person\nwho is trying their hardest not to fail\nan exam. Seriously!!! And it just went\non and on and on, sounding quite a lot\nlike a cat singing the song of its people.\nI think the worst thing about it was\nthere was nothing I could do. With\ncorrections there is tipp-ex, with\nlecturers you can go as long as possible\nwithout calling them anything, and\nwith students you can make it quite\nclear you are looking for someone\nwho is rich enough to pay for the rest\nof your academic career. Here, I was\nhelpless.\nSo apologies to you. I hope the\nexam went ok. Thus my confession\nthis week can only be that even GTA\u2019s\nbodies let them down more often than\nthey would like to admit.\nR\nichard III marks the\nstart of Shakespeare\u2019s\nlongstanding engagement\nwith villainy. From the\n\u2018motiveless malignity\u2019 of\nIago to the sublime tragic grandeur of\nthe Macbeths, the roots of all can be\nspied in this early work; the scandalous\ngraveside seduction, the poisonous\nforce of Queen Margaret. And yet, it\nis an early work and this shows: the\nplay lacks the psychological subtlety\nof Othello, the (if you will forgive an\noxymoron) crude sophistication of\nTroilus and Cressida, the scale of A\nWinter\u2019s Tale, the profundity of the\nundeservedly lesser known Richard\nII. Similarly, the pathos during the\ndeath of the little Prince is a little\ntoo pathetic, the ghosts serve too\nsimplistic a function when compared\nto their counterparts in Hamlet, Julius\nCaesar and Macbeth. Finally there\nis Richard himself, vulgar without\nIago\u2019s intelligence, a short (Napoleon\nComplex susurrates on the periphery\nof every analysis), grotesque figure of\na very picturesque evil.\nYet he has a certain tragic dignity,\nbehind the bathos. The legacy\nbequeathed on us by the ancients, of\nsympathy and catharsis, still hold sway\nin the poetry of the classical \u00e9poque.\nWe know well that Richard is nothing\nother than his rapacious surface, yet\nthe very form of tragic theatre grants\nhim a closeness to us. A closeness\nwhich, while we stare on, in wonder\nand in terror, is stolen from the rest of\nthe world.\nThis, to adapt a phrase from our\nfriends across the Atlantic, is the\nworld this winter: in Iraq, Mohammed\nAbdul-Hameed, Raad Yassin AlBaddi, Wassan Al-Azzawi, Jamal\nAbdul-Nasser Sami and Ahmed\nKhattab Ohmar are murdered during\na raid on local TV station Salaheddin\nTV. In Bangladesh a nameless lawyer\nis beaten by four men as she protests\nin the run-up to the coming election.\nIn Japan, TEPCO employees are\n\u2018asked\u2019 to return compensation money\nfor working in the devastated nuclear\nwastes of Tohoku. In the US, in New\nOrleans, a sex worker unknowingly\ncontracts HIV. Earlier, she decided not\nto carry condoms with her; she heard\nthe police were using them as evidence\nin prosecutions for prostitution. In\nthe West Bank, 23 Palestinians face\nthe immediate loss of their homes\nand livelihoods following an illegal\ncourt ruling in early December. In\nSouth Africa, Funeka Soldaat tries\nto help another victim of \u2018corrective\nrape\u2019, rape aimed at \u2018curing\u2019 lesbians\nof their homosexuality. In Colombia\nthe family of Albeiro V\u00e1ldez Mart\u00ednez\ncontinue to face death-threats for\nattempting to reclaim their land.\nWhen V\u00e1ldez returned to his farm in\nNovember 2009, a cattle rancher who\nhad taken over the farm while V\u00e1ldez\nwas displaced threatened to kill him.\nWhen V\u00e1ldez was found murdered\nin March 2010, the mayor of the\ntown returned the land to the cattle\nrancher\u2026\nMeanwhile: a complacent Alain\nFienkelkraut holds court on the\n\u2018clash of civilisations\u2019 from his desk\nat the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. TEPCO\nshareholders see a 136% yearly return,\nwhile the Telegraph worries that John\nKerry and America might just be a\nlittle too late to come to the \u2018rescue\u2019. I\npresume that asking of whom is to beg\nthe question? Bloomberg announces \u2013\nsurprise, surprise \u2013 that the rich got\nricher, and \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 that\nthey will continue to get richer. That\nballast of intellectuality and historical\nsensitivity, Shinzo Abe, takes a\nspiritual jaunt with war criminals\nbefore watching Japan\u2019s latest big\nbudget nationalist farce Eien no Zero,\nThe Eternal Zero\u2026\nPerhaps it is not so much that the\nform of theatre grants our favourite\ntragic heroes an immediacy lost to\nothers, as that a certain distance in the\nvery ways in which we relate with each\nother allows the theatre to maintain\nan equally \u2018close distance\u2019, so to speak.\nIt has long been said that, at least since\nthe dawn of the classic age, and in my\nopinion since long before, language\nis autotelic, that signification is\nreflexive, that representation is always\nrepresentation of representation\u2026\nCertainly Shakespeare assures us that\nall the world\u2019s a stage, and if the men\nand women are really only players\nthen perhaps, just perhaps, these\nplayers gain the dimensions of men\nand women.\nYet when we reach events where all\nthe world really is a stage (you will, I\nhope, forgive the anachronism), the\nplayers lose their tragic dignity. They\nbecome not individuals but a faceless\nmass, without name and without\nhistory. And when the winter of our\ndiscontent is made summer by the\nrising sun of York?

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 17 JAN\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe best of festive TV\nT\nhere must have been few\nshows in recent memory\nthat were so widely\nanticipated as series three of\nSherlock. The first two series\nearned themselves a legion of fans\nfor their clever stories, impeccable\ncharacterisation and fine acting from\nleads Benedict Cumberbatch, playing\nHolmes, and Martin Freeman, playing\nhis friend Watson. The final episode\nof second season, \u2018The Reichenbach\nFall\u2019, proved particularly popular, with\nHolmes having his final confrontation\nwith his nemesis Moriarty and faking\nhis death \u2013 the final scene showing\nthat he had somehow survived a fall\nfrom the roof of St Bart\u2019s Hospital,\ndespite several witnesses supposedly\nseeing his dead body.\nWith two whole years between\nthis and the start of the latest series,\nfans had driven themselves wild\nwith speculation as to how Sherlock\nsurvived. It is therefore quite\nappropriate that the first scene of\nthe first episode, \u2018The Empty Hearse\u2019,\npurportedly an explanation of how\nHolmes did it, turned out to be, in\nfact, a wild theory from a character\nwho is obsessed with proving that the\ngreat detective is somehow still alive.\nIndeed, a major subplot of \u2018The Empty\nHearse\u2019 is effectively an affectionate\nsatire of fan culture \u2013 with the episode\nshowingusagroupofSherlockHolmes\nobsessives who take turns to present\ntheir increasingly outlandish theories\nof how the our protagonist could have\nsurvived. This was a very fun element\nof the first episode which fortunately\ndistracted somewhat from the fact\nthat the actual explanation turned out\nto be somewhat pedestrian. It was also\nan example of the show\u2019s continuing\nclever and successful efforts to bring\nthe story into the modern era. The first\nepisode, for example, also very briefly\ntouched on the theme of controversial\nterrorism legislation while the third,\n\u2018His Final Vow\u2019, focussed heavily on\nMurdoch-style journalistic excesses\n\u2013 all the while remaining true to the\nspirit of the original Holmes stories.\nHowever, what really made this\nseries of Sherlock so enjoyable is what\nearned the show its popularity in the\nfirst place \u2013 its writing. The original\nSherlock Holmes stories were known\nprimarily for their meticulously\nconstructed mysteries, and Holmes\u2019\nunique ability to solve them. The show\nmaintains this key feature but also goes\nfar further in exploring the characters\nof Holmes and Watson \u2013 building up\na powerful study of the relationship\nbetween the two men. This is done\nparticularly well in the second\nepisode, \u2018The Sign of Three\u2019, which\nleaves the mystery element somewhat\nin the background and focuses on\nHolmes having to deal with acting\nas best man at Watson\u2019s wedding.\nEverything \u2013 from the pacing, to\nthe plotting, to the brilliantly sharp\nand witty dialogue \u2013 comes together\nperfectly to show how the two men,\ndespite each often finding the other\nfrustrating, have grown to genuinely\ncare for one another.\nWhile \u2018The Sign of Three\u2019 was more\nintrospective, \u2018His Final Vow\u2019 was a\nreturn to the show\u2019s more traditional\ntense drama, with Holmes up against\nmaster blackmailer Charles Augustus\nMagnussen. The episode was fast\npaced, exciting, and filled with twists\nthat, while unexpected, felt very\nnatural and which were, in hindsight,\nset up well in advance. The ending in\nparticular was done very effectively,\ndrawing on many elements that had\nbeen developed earlier in the series\nand finally presenting Holmes with a\ntrue no-win scenario. It was a tragic\nand poignant sequence that would\nMaciej Matuszewski reviews two highly-anticipated Christmas specials\nSherlock\nhave served as a fitting finale to the\nshow itself.\nThat is why I have somewhat mixed\nthoughts about how the very final\nscene was a set up for the next series.\nWhile I have every faith in the show\u2019s\ncreative team I fear that they may\nstruggle to replicate this series highs.\nIn any case, I hope that this time it will\ntake us less than two years to find out.\nDoctor Who:\nThe Time of\nthe Doctor\nD\noctor Who is\nsimultaneously one of\nthe best and one of the\nmost infuriating science\nfiction television shows\nout there. I can think of no other\nshow with a premise that has so much\npotential. With a machine capable of\ntaking our heroes anywhere in time\nand space, and a protagonist whose\nface and, to some extent, personality,\nchange every few years, the writers\nof Doctor Who have the freedom to\ntell pretty much any story that they\nwant. Yet, throughout its many years,\nthe show has too often been plagued\nby bad writing and terrible story\ndecisions.\nThe first few years of Matt Smith\u2019s\ntenure as the Doctor, and Steven Moffat\u2019s as head writer and executive pro-ducer, were, in particular, a very mixed\nbag. A small number of brilliant epi-sodes, like \u2018Vincent and the Doctor\u2019\nand \u2018The Doctor\u2019s Wife\u2019, couldn\u2019t outweigh an often painfully convoluted\nmetaplot and some of the worst moments in the show\u2019s history \u2013 from\nthe simply dreadful \u2018The Curse of the\nBlack Spot\u2019, to the offensively bad \u2018The\nAlmost People\u2019, to the near incomprehensible \u2018The Wedding of River Song\u2019.\nThe most recent series of the show,\nhowever, did seem to show some im-provement, with most episodes being\nat least competently written and ex-ecuted. This, together with a generally\nenjoyable fiftieth anniversary special\nin the form of \u2018The Day of the Doctor\u2019,\nmade me reasonably hopeful going\ninto this year\u2019s Christmas special, and\nMatt Smith\u2019s final episode \u2013 \u2018The Time\nof the Doctor\u2019.\nThe episode opens with the Doctor setting off to explore a mysterious\nplanet that has been transmitting an\nincomprehensible signal throughout\nall of space and time. However, upon\narriving he discovers that the planet\nis Trenzalore, the world on which he\nis fated to finally die. With Trenzalore\nbeginning to be surrounded by the\nfleets of all his enemies, who have also\nreceived the signal, he must work to\nuncover its secret while protecting the\nplanet\u2019s innocent inhabitants.\n\u2018The Day of the Doctor\u2019 certainly\ndidn\u2019t disappoint. Many previous Doctor Who season finales and specials\nhave focused on big threats to the\nexistence of the universe itself \u2013 not\nonly making the show repetitive but\nalso making what should have been\nbig events seem cheap and vacuous.\n\u2018The Time of the Doctor\u2019 was a pleasant change in that, while maintaining\nhigh stakes, it focused far more on\nthe character of the Doctor himself.\nHere we see him at his best \u2013 fun\nand eccentric, while also absolutely\ndedicated to doing right and helping\nothers. The Eleventh Doctor\u2019s \u2018death\u2019,\nof old age after having literally spent\ncenturies protecting the people of\nTrenzalore, fitted the character perfectly and was executed remarkably\nwell. The episode even managed to tie\ntogether most of the loose ends from\nthe Silence plotline, which had been\nplaguing Matt Smith\u2019s run since his\nfirst episode, in a surprisingly satisfying fashion. The use of so many of\nthe Doctor\u2019s classic old enemies, and\nsome surprising old friends, would, in\nmany other episodes, have felt cheap.\nHowever, with the themes of the finality and reflection permeating through\nthe entire episode, here it felt very ap-propriate.\nSure, the obligatory Christmas\ntheme felt tacked on \u2013 but then it was\nnot treated as particularly important\nby episode itself. Sure, there were a\nlot of plot holes \u2013 but by now I\u2019ve gotten tired of complaining about such\nthings when it comes to this show.\nSure, it wasn\u2019t the best thing that I\u2019ve\never seen and it doesn\u2019t quite stand up\nwith the true classics of Doctor Who \u2013\nbut it was far better than I could have\ndared to expect given what had come\nbefore. Truly, a fitting farewell to the\nEleventh Doctor. With the show now\nseeming ready to make a fresh start,\nand with Peter Capaldi taking his\nimpressive acting talents to the role\nof the Twelfth Doctor, I am quietly\nhopeful about Doctor Who\u2019s future.\nscreenrush\nBBC\n\n"

    "content": "38 FRIDAY 17 JAN\nSPORT Editor: Kunal Wagle\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSnooker and\nPool: The year\nso far\nIt was a term to remember for\nthe Imperial mints, as membership\nrocketed and records tumbled, in\nwhat was a fantastic ending to a\ndifficult year.\nThe autumn term began, as it\nalways does, with the madness of\nFreshers\u2019 fair \u2013 an event at which Rob\n\u201crobbing frames\u201d Hughes excelled\nand embarrassed himself in equal\nmeasure. His decision to dress up\nas a pool table left him continually\nswamped by freshers, with several\nbegging to borrow the outfit for the\nafter-party and many more pledging\nto join the club. The gimmick, along\nwith the club\u2019s mini pool table,\nmanned by president Max \u201cmaximum\nsafety\u201d Chalmers, clearly captured the\nimagination of the fair-going public\nas membership was up by 50% on the\nprevious year by the time freshers\u2019\nfortnight drew to a close.\nThe Southern Universities 8-ball\nPool Championships took place in\nthe third week of term and the club\ndeparted for a sun-soaked Guildford\nwith a number of new and exciting\ntalents in tow. They had been selected\nfrom the hugely well attended \u2013 and\nextremely competitive \u2013 team trials\ntournament, which saw the club take\nover the whole of Rileys sports bar in\nVictoria.\nThe tournament might have been\na complete disaster for our lads after\nall of them were knocked out of the\nIndividual Championship in their\nfirst or second round matches. The\nteam tournament also got off to an\nequally shaky start; with the firsts and\nseconds taking one frame between\nthem (from a possible 18!) in their\nfirst three matches. Things began\nto look desperate, before they took\na dramatic turn, with Markus \u201cthe\nMarksman\u201d Frembs (a newcomer\nto the club), President Max and Ben\n\u201chardly ginger\u201d Harvey putting in\nsome stunning frames to inspire their\nrespective teams.\nFrom there the first team won all\ntheir remaining group matches to\nqualify for the championship, while\nthe second team put in some excellent\nperformances despite finishing\nbottom of their group and leaving a\nday early. While the first team was\nsubsequently knocked out by a very\nstrong Kent side, their 7th placed\nfinish was the club\u2019s best ever result\nin a pool tournament and they left\nthe competition with their heads held\nhigh.\nNo national university snooker took\nplace in the first term, but that didn\u2019t\nstop the club holding a number of\ninternal events, with the early rounds\nof the Freshers\u2019 tournament taking\nplace on commemoration day. Players\nof all strengths took part in the first-years only event, with LSE\u2019s Charnon\nBoonnuch the first non-Imperialite\nto take part in the competition. He\nwas only defeated in the final which\nhe lost 4-3 to \u201cthe Marksman\u201d who\nwas making quite a start to his time at\nImperial.\nThe Internal Snooker League had its\nopening group stage from November\nuntil the conclusion of term, with\nthe competition as fierce as ever. A\nnumber of shock exits were seen, as\nthis year\u2019s freshers provided a greater\nthreat than many had anticipated.\nPredictably, Bogdan, loser of only 2\ninternal matches ever, sailed through\nwhile \u201chardly ginger\u201d Harvey won\nan impressive four out of four in\nwhat had looked like a tough group.\nThe competition now splits into the\nChampionship and Trophy in the\nspring term and there is all to play\nfor \u2013 even for those whose luck didn\u2019t\nhold in the first term.\nThe year came to an exquisite end\nin Telford, at the UPC 9-ball Pool\nChampionships. Compared with\nGuildford, the tournament turned\nout to be somewhat of a reversal of\nfortunes, with the major triumph\ncoming in the individual event and\nthe team performance being a little\ndisappointing. Due to the harsh nature\nof 9-ball competition, our three man\nteam found themselves completely\nknocked out after only two losses, a\nresult which disappointed Alex \u201cmagic\ncross\u201d Lambrianos almost as much as\nthe lack of sausage rolls at the event.\nSimilarly swift eliminations from the\nindividuals were in store for both Max\nand Alex, but not for \u201cthe Marksman\u201d\nof Deutschland. The affable German\nran nurburgrings around his hapless\nopponents all the way to the Semis\nwhere he fell to fellow \u201causlander\u201d\nBernd Gentoner in a match which\nUPC\u2019s Facebook page described as\n\u201carguably the best match we have seen\nin the history of the competition\u201d.\nIn finishing 3rd he became the first\nImperial player ever to medal at an\nexternal pool tournament. What a\nplayer.\nRob Hughes\nIC Snooker and Pool\nTriathlon Club Take\non the BUCS Chilly\nDuathlon to End 2013\nEd Hallett\nIC Triathlon\nW\nith the biggest\nturn out the\ntriathlon club\nhas ever seen,\ntwenty five\nathletes travelling in an entourage\nof cars, minibus and one van down\nthe M4. The term was to culminate\non Sunday 24th at the 2013 BUCS\nDuathlon at Castle Combe.\nThis fast pace race sees competitors\ncircumnavigate the famous Castle\nCombe race track before mounting\nbikes and racing five laps of the track\nitself. Then to finish you off, a painful\nfinal two mile lap around the outside\nof the track on foot brings the pain-faced athletes to the finish line.\nOutstanding performances were\nseen from Charlie Houston with a\nfinish time of 48:06.7 putting him\n67th and Sophie Kirk in 56:45.7 for\n40th fastest woman of the day, closely\nfollowedbyImoSimmondssixseconds\nlater to take 42nd. The pressure of the\nday got to a few competitors, with\nEd Hallett having a disappointing\nday after losing his racking position\nin transition and wasting 30 seconds\nof hard earned time; Sian Morgan\nagain lost time in a momentary loss\nof awareness by starting the second\nrun with her shoes on the wrong feet!\nCommiserations must be made to\nEllie Howard however after putting in\na strong first run time of 13:39.8 her\nhelmet strap broke. The marshals tied\nthe helmet quickly to her head but alas,\ntoo tightly: three laps into the bike leg\nand she was losing blood supply to her\nhead... enough was enough and she\nhad to back out of the race.\nAfter a quick race and with pain faces\na thing of the past, Weatherspoons\nprovided the necessary post-race\nburger and beer to round off the day\nand see everyone home replenished\nafter the final race of 2013.\nNext term sees the start of the\nTriathlon session for 2014, and some\nbig events, including BUCS sprint\nand Olympic triathlons, as well as an\nEaster tour to Paris and a Summer\ntour of England.

    "content": "29\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 17 JAN\nTELEVISION\nB\natman is a popular\nsuperhero to say the\nleast, and, as such, he\u2019s\nappeared in many TV\nshows over the years.\nThree years after the 1989 film, a\nnew animated series was produced,\ncalled Batman: The Animated Series.\nThe 80s had been a prolific year for\nanimation, producing shows like HeMan, Transformers and GI Joe, but\nthey had a tendency to be simplistic,\nrepetitive, and unchallenging. This\nshow forever redefined American\nanimation by saying that kids\u2019\ncartoons could be dark, mature, and\nintelligent. It never took its audience\nfor granted, showing Batman and the\ncharacters of his universe in the noir,\ngrown-up way that Burton had done\non film and Miller had done in comics\nin the previous decade. After airing\nfor over 100 episodes, it spawned an\nentire universe of connected animated\nshows, including two Justice League\nshows and a far-future sequel. To\nput it briefly, it was both good and\nsuccessful.\nCartoon Corner\nLet\u2019s talk about Batman\nTom Rivlin\nHowever, it isn\u2019t the last Batman\nshow to have graced our screens. Since\nB:TAS stopped airing, there have been\nthree more shows about the caped\ncrusader. The first one, The Batman,\nwas largely similar to the original\nexcept for being worse (which is not\nan insult \u2013 it was still a decent show).\nThe most recent one, Beware the\nBatman, is getting canned after only\n13 episodes (which is a shame, I have\nheard it was good). The second one,\nhowever, was something completely\ndifferent. Let\u2019s compare Batman: The\nBrave and the Bold with Batman: The\nAnimated Series.\nThe description here of B:TAS\nstresses how \u201cmature\u201d and \u201cdark\u201d it\nwas (the word \u201cnoir\u201d was even used at\none point). The reason the show was\nthat way was because it was heavily\ninfluenced by the trend in comics\nat the time, and by the aesthetic of\nthe Burton films. In the mid-80s,\nthe comics Watchmen and The Dark\nKnight Returns were published.\nThey both essentially redefined\nthe entire genre of the superhero\ncomic \u2013 putting the final nail in the\ncoffin of the campy, child-friendly\naesthetic they had had since the 1950s\n(perfectly encapsulated by the Adam\nWest Batman show of the time). This\nhas generally been considered to be\na Good Thing. It allowed the comics\nindustry to \u201cgrow up\u201d and reflect\ntheir changing audience, and B:TAS\u2019s\nacceptance of this played a big part in\nhow great a show it was.\nBatman: The Brave and the Bold\nsaw things differently. At the very\nheight of the Nolan movies\u2019 popularity\n(just after The Dark Knight came\nout), this show began. It rejected\nthe accepted wisdom that had been\nestablished for superheroes, and for\nBatman especially, that superheroes\nwere Serious People who did Serious\nPeople Things, and took Batman right\nback to the aesthetics of the comics\nfrom the \u201cSilver Age\u201d (the 1960s \u2013 the\nname of the show comes from a comic\nbook anthology series from that time).\nDrawing inspiration from the zaniest,\nmost far out, obscure corners of the\nDC universe, the central premise of\nthe show was that every episode had\nBatman teaming up with a different\nDC character to fight an impossibly\nhuge variety of villains. Recurring\ncharacters included \u2019second-tier\u2019\nheroes like Blue Beetle, Green Arrow\nand Aquaman, with more minor and\nmajor characters only making one-off appearances (Superman only\nappeared twice).\nEverything in the show was a\nlove letter to the Silver Age comics\nthe writers clearly grew up loving,\nwith every episode bursting full of\nreferences to characters, places,\nthemes and stories from the whole\nhistory of DC comics. There were even\nreferences to other Batman shows,\nwith Adam West playing Batman\u2019s\nfather in one episode. (Adam West also\nplayed a pastiche of the 60s Batman in\nB:TAS \u2013 he sure made a career out of\nmaking fun of himself!) The show was\nfilled with the imagination and lighthearted enthusiasm that made comics\nso appealing to kids at the time, and\nspotting every gag, in-joke and subtle\nnod to the wider DC universe in each\nepisode was a fun game for long-time\nfans.\nMost importantly, Brave and the\nBold was completely self-aware. It\nknew it was going against the trend by\npresenting Batman in this way. It knew\nit would be considered less \u201cadult\u201d\nby modern day Batman fans, but it\ndidn\u2019t care. In one memorable scene,\nBat-Mite, an omnipotent imp from\nthe fifth dimension who is a hardcore\nBatman fan, attends a fifth dimension\nComic-Con (I feel the need to say \u201cnot\nmaking this up\u201d a lot in this column)\nand justifies the lighter nature of\nthe show in front of an audience of\nhardcore fans who prefer the dark/\ngritty Batman. The show didn\u2019t take\nitself too seriously as a story where\nthe characters go through hardship\nand turmoil, but it took itself seriously\nas a valid alternative to the modern\nBatman that kids, long- time fans and\neveryone in between could enjoy.\nThis column was originally intended\nto be a side-by-side comparison\nof the two shows, but as I began\nwriting it became clear that the only\nthing I wanted to say about B:TAS\nwas that it was great for the same\nreasons things like The Dark Knight\nwere great, and everyone already\nknows about that. There was a lot\nmore to say about Brave and the\nBold because it was just so different.\nThe creators knew they didn\u2019t want\nto make another clone of B:TAS, so\nthey made something unique, and\nthat was far more interesting to talk\nabout here. Brave and the Bold ended\nafter 65 episodes, a decent run for a\ncartoon, but it definitely could have\nrun for longer. Sadly, it was probably\ncancelled to make way for Beware the\nBatman, which swung way back to\nthe dark/gritty side of things, which\nis what the suits wanted. Either way,\nit made its mark and had fun doing it.\nWhich of the two shows was better?\nIt\u2019s hard to say, for although being\nabout ostensibly the same character,\nthey were as different as night and day.\nGirls, uninterrupted\nI\nt\u2019s been a year since we last saw\nthe girls of Girls, so the news\nthat its third series would return\nwith a double bill was definitely\nwelcome. The ever-divisive show\npicks up a short while after we left off\nat the end of the second season, in\nwhich time there\u2019s been more than a\nfew developments. Although Hannah\nand Adam are very much in an \u2018on\u2019\nphase of their on-off relationship\nafter he ran through the streets of\nNew York in answer to her desperate\ncry for help, Marnie and Charlie are\nmost definitely off, with the former\nturning to her mother in consolation.\nAlso firmly broken-up are Ray and\nShoshanna, while wild child Jessa\nhas resurfaced after months of\ndisappearance \u2013 in rehab.\nIf the finale of series two seemed\nuncharacteristically optimistic and\nrom-com-esque,withAdamheroically\ndashing to Hannah\u2019s rescue and\nMarnie and Charlie\u2019s reconciliation,\nthe first episode of season three soon\nbwrings us back to Girls\u2019 familiar\nterritory of poor life decisions and\npublic confrontations. When Adam\nand Hannah find themselves face to\nface with Natalia, his ex-girlfriend\nfrom last series, she and her friend\nwaste no time in letting Adam know\nexactly how badly he treated her.\nAlthough Adam seems genuinely\nsincere in his apologies, things get\nworse when Hannah is dragged into\nthe mix. By the time Natalia has\nfinished describing Adam as an \u2018off\nthe wagon, Neanderthal, sex-addict\nsociopath\u2019 and telling the couple to\n\u2018enjoy your urine-soaked life,\u2019 any\nlingering rom-com illusions have been\nfully dispelled.\nMeanwhile, Jessa\u2019s trip to rehab\nis, it emerges, courtesy of her\ngrandmother, who\u2019s dictated that she\nspend sixty days attempting to recover\nfrom her many, many problems.\nUnsurprisingly, it doesn\u2019t prove to\nbe effective, as Jessa endeavours to\ndisrupt every meeting and make every\nother patient hate her. Even a pep\ntalk from guest star Richard E. Grant\ndoesn\u2019t seem to make a difference, and\nwhen Jessa accuses another patient of\nusing rehab to avoid coming to terms\nwith her sexuality, anyone with more\nthan a cursory familiarity with the\nusual events of the show can predict\nwhat follows.\nThe second episode of the double\nbill takes a different approach, with\nthe majority taking place on Hannah,\nAdam and Shoshanna\u2019s road trip to\npick up Jessa from rehab. (On a side\nnote, Hannah\u2019s willingness to drive\nfor hours to pick up the friend who\nabandoned her months ago is one of\nthose subtly perfect Girls moments.)\nThe trip provides ample opportunities\nfor interaction between polar\nopposites Adam and Shoshanna, and\na painfully frank conversation on\nwhether college days really are the\nbest days of your life with Hannah,\nwhich particularly resonated with me\nas a final year soon-to-be graduate.\nIt\u2019s impressive that, even in its third\nseries, Girls still feels as fresh as ever.\nIt is unique in its place as a no holds\nbarred depiction of uncomfortably\nrelatable young women, imperfections\nincluded. It\u2019ll be interesting to see\nwhere Lena Dunham, growing visibly\nmore confident in her skill as writer\nand director, takes the rest of the\nseries. Having already proven time\nafter time that she\u2019s unafraid to take\nrisks, one thing is for sure: it\u2019ll be\nanything but boring.\nHBO\nEmily Fulham celebrates the return of the most honest show on TV\n\n"

It\u2019s a name all gamers are\nfamiliarwith,andit\u2019sacompanywhich\ndeals with all aspects of a gamers\nneeds by providing good quality\nperipherals and accessories. The\nSteelseries 9H is a top range headset\nfrom the H series of tournament grade\nheadsets provided by Steelseries and\nhas been available only as of late 2013.\nStarting with the aesthetics, the\n9H looks like a heavy duty headset\nwhich has padded ear cups thick with\nleather cushions used to isolate noise\nin a passive fashion, encompassed\nby a durable plastic sheath around\neach ear cup which can resist a\nsizeable amount of wear and tear. The\nblack on orange is a characteristic\nSteelseries colour combination and\nit functions very well, producing a\ngreat overall look. The headband is\nan iconic design emblazoned with\nthe Steelseries logo and is complete\nwith four discrete cushions which\nare, similar to the ear cups, very\nsoft and do make it very easy to last\nlong gaming sessions without having\nthe need to readjust or remove the\nheadset. It is of a great overall\nbuild quality, as the sturdiness\nof the outer shell coupled\nwith the luxurious cushions\ndefinitely makes it feel like\na high quality headset.\nThe bass and the\ntreble quality produced\nby the 9H exceed\nthe price tag of the\nheadset. It functions\nlike professional\nh e a d p h o n e s\nwhen listening\nto electronic\nmusic, however\nthe highs aren\u2019t\nas crisp as would\nbe preferred,\nhowever this\nis a minor\nissue which can\nbe overlooked\nconsidering the\nheadset is not designed\nwith music in mind, and\nthe infrequent highs in\ngames means that it wouldn\u2019t\nnormally be noticeable. The\nbass feels\nricher, however it\nsurprisingly does not\ndetract from the overall\nsound quality which is a\ncombination rarely achieved by\nheadphones. The headset boasts\nvirtual Dolby 7.1 surround sound,\nwhich significantly enhances\nthe gaming\nexperience and allows elevated\nprecision pinpointing of sound\norigins, a critical feature which I\npersonally found to greatly add to\nthe experience of games. This\nis facilitated by the addition\nof a USB sound card with\nthe headset which is an\noptional feature, but\nallows for a wealth of\ncustomisation to suit\nthe user\u2019s needs. An\nequaliser is provided to\neasily adjust the sound\nsettings for different\ngame types and\ndifferent needs, and\na host of microphone\nsettings are provided\nwhich can reduce\nambient noise as\nwell as automated\nm i c r o p h o n e\nc o m p r e s s i o n\nwhich allows for a\nconstant microphone\nvolume across different\ncommunication software,\nremoving the need to fiddle\naround with settings on different\nVoIP programs, all in a simple user\nfriendly piece of software downloaded\nfrom the Steelseries website.\nThe microphone is one aspect of\nthe 9H which was average at best.\nThe quality is very good, and the\nbackground noise reduction is highly\neffective, however in the midst of\nthese settings, the true sound of\nthe voice is somewhat distorted\nand does not clearly represent the\nvoice of the user. It must be added\nthat the unidirectional nature\nof the microphone is a fantastic\nfeature and definitely helps to pick\nup only what needs to be heard.\nOverall the Steelseries 9H is a\nperfect accessory to all varieties of\ngamers and is a solid purchase. At\n\u00a3130 it is not the cheapest headset out\nthere, but it is a worthy investment for\nthose looking to buy a good headset\nto last them for a long time. They are\ndurable and provide a high sound\nquality, and with their swappable\ncables they can be taken on the go to\nlisten to music, not restricting their\nuse on the computer. The lacking\nmicrophone quality and the slightly\nlacklustre highs are the only issues\nwith an overall outstanding headset,\nand it therefore gets a score of 8.5/10.\nSteelseries 9H Tournament Headset\nWant to read Felix on your iOS Device?\nIntroducing the Felix App, launching today!\nSimply go to: http://bit.ly/1dkDF6J and press download!\nLog on to catch up with your\nweekly College news :)\nWritten by Kunal Wagle\n\n"

    "content": "24 FRIDAY 17 JAN\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNebraska, Nebraska, I love you\nFollowing on from the Oscar-nominated The Descendants (featuring\nGeorge Clooney\u2019s best performance\nin years, and introducing the amazing\nShailene Woodley \u2013 soon to be seen\nin The Fault in Our Stars), Nebraska\nis Alexander Payne\u2019s latest film as\ndirector, and (unsurprisingly) it\u2019s almost everything you\u2019d expect \u2013 and\na little more. Shot entirely in black-and-white, Nebraska gains an ethereal\nkind of beauty in appearance \u2013 the\nfrequent landscape shots, previously\nso full of life, colour and Hawaii in The\nJack Steadman\nTreasured Writer\nNebraska\nDirector: Alexander Payne\nWriter: Bob Nelson\nStarring: Bruce Dern, Will Forte,\nJune Squibb\nRuntime: 115 minutes\nCertification: 15\nDescendants are replaced by haunting images of the wide-open spaces of\nNebraska: a sunrise without any colour is an incredibly surreal shot, but a\nstrangely picturesque one. It\u2019s through\nthis lens the rest of the film is viewed,\nand with some drop-dead gorgeous\nshot composition (even of a field full\nof cows, at one point), it\u2019s a fantastic\nplace to start.\nFortunately, Nebraska doesn\u2019t drop\nthe ball from there \u2013 if anything, it\nbuilds on it. The plot is simple, slow-moving and rather easily resolved, but\nit\u2019s also utterly irrelevant here. The\nfocus lies on the interactions between\nthe characters, and it shines through\nthe monochrome in glorious Technicolor. Bruce Dern delivers a career-best performance as Woody, the con-fused, elderly father convinced he\u2019s\nwon a million dollars, capturing every\nnuance of a man who\u2019s not quite sure\nwhere he is anymore, while the supporting cast are almost universally ex-cellent. Will Forte steps away from his\ncomedy background to play the role\nof the earnest, caring Dave, while Bob\nOdenkirk (Breaking Bad\u2019s Saul Goodman) pops up to take on a somewhat\nless legally and morally questionable\nrole, with the an absolute treat that is\nJune Squibb as Woody\u2019s feisty wife.\nThe chemistry within the family\nunit is incredible, but it\u2019s the comedy\nof the extended family and friends that\nreally steals the show (although, having said that \u2013 a scene in a graveyard\nis priceless, proving an undeniable\nhighlight that tops The Descendants\u2019\nrunning-in-flip-flops scene for comedic absurdity, and manages to be funnier than half of 2014\u2019s comedies so\nfar). There are a multitude of scenes\nthat provoke prolonged, out-loud\nlaughter, tinged (as always) with a hint\nof melancholy and sadness. Although\nNebraska lacks the emotionally crippling ending of The Descendants (I appreciate this review is just turning into\nan extended comparison, and I would\napologise were it not for the fact I\nloved The Descendants, so there), it\nstill has its moments of tenderness\nand plain-dealing emotion, if never\nquite tipping over into out-and-out\nsentimentality.\nThere are a few moments of wry social commentary hidden amongst everything else \u2013 most notably a cheeky\nnod to America\u2019s relationship with\ntechnology over people \u2013 but ultimately this is a deeply personal, intimate film about people. It\u2019s near per-fect, and it\u2019ll leave you with a smile on\nyour face but a tinge of sadness in your\nheart. And it also features the best\nfight sequence ever, so there\u2019s that.\nThe last samurai movie PLEASE\nAnonymous\nAsian Writer\n47 Ronin\nDirector: Carl Rinsch\nWriters: Chris Morgan, Hossein\nAmini, Walter Hamada\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Hiroyuki\nSanada, Ko Shibasaki, Rinko Kikuchi\nRuntime: 118 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nThere is no doubt that 47 Ronin was\nUniversal Studio\u2019s hope-child given\nits vast budget of $175-million. However, unlike The Last Samurai in\nwhose footsteps this movie obviously\nattempted to follow, the difference\nbetween their respective results is\nstark; in fact, rather akin to that between a samurai (warriors following\nthe bushid\u014d serving their liege) and a\nronin (ex-samurai who has failed and\nthereby lost his liege), a concept that\nthe film is supposedly based on but on\nwhich the film curiously lacks much\nexpansion apart from a brief narration of the definition of a ronin in the\nbeginning and sporadic mentions of\n\u2018honour\u2019 here and there.\nOne foremost difference is that the\nprotagonist in The Last Samurai was a\nforeigner and hence, the dialogue was\nclearly split between English and Japanese. As the protagonist in 47 Ronin,\nKai (Keanu Reeves), is born and raised\nin Japan it follows that the entire Japanese cast (basically everyone except\nReeves) would need to act in English\nlest the film become subtitle heavy.\nApart from 18th Century Japanese\ncharacters speaking English somewhat denting the authenticity of the\nfilm itself, this is surprisingly less of\na hindrance in enjoying the film compared to the predictability and general\ncheesiness of the film\u2019s dialogue itself.\n\u201cI would search through a thousand\nworlds and ten thousand lifetimes until I find you\u201d? Yes, it might actually\ntake that long before such line does a\n180\u00b0 and is considered not cheesy. Or\na desperate attempt to keep the love\nline that seems forced in plot as well\nas in performance.\nThe legend of the 47 ronin is a fundamental one surrounding the Japanese culture and history of the samu-rai, which has been retold in so many\nforms of arts and literature with lots\nof material to offer. However, you just\ncan\u2019t help feeling much has been stereotyped and simplified \u2013 exiled warriors striving to revenge their wronged\nmaster with a clich\u00e9 villain and star-crossed lovers thrown in for good\nmeasure. Throughout the film you can\nsee much evidence that the film struggled to walk the fine line between an\nart-house samurai film (abundance of\ncherry blossoms, the colourful costumes and even somewhat bizarre\nlooking makeup making up an overall\nimpressive visual) and a more easy-to-swallow mainstream action film with\nEastern influences (err, the character\nKai himself, the illustrious shapeshifting witch (Rinko Kikuchi), feeble\nlove-line with Mika (Ko Shibasaki) the\ndaughter of Lord Asano (Min Tanaka)\netc.).\nIn theory, catching two such birds\nwith one stone would have been\ngreat, however, in real life, it would\nhave been better if the film simply\ndirected all its efforts to one and did\nit well rather than being neither here\nnor there. Rather disappointingly for\na samurai film, it even lacks in decent\nswordfights: they are all too quick and\neasy to end, which was probably not\nhelped by its 12A rating.\nApart from the underwhelming\nquality and amount of action scenes\nmany other aspects of the film remain shamefully underused. Lord\nKira (Tadanobu Asano) spends most\nof his time sitting down and is only\nawarded with a rather short ultimate\nfight at the end, there is very little plot\nsurrounding the Tengu (nanny figure\nof Kai with owl reminiscent eyes in\nthe film, a mythical Japanese creature\ntypically with red face, long Pinocchio\nnose with big sword and feather fan\nin Japanese myth) and the full-body-skeleton-tattooed gunman and even\nKai himself spends a considerable\namount of time standing around like\na bystander. The character that carries\nthe heavy burden of leading and carrying on the plot of the film falls on the\nshoulder of \u00d4ishi (Hiroyuki Sanada)\nwho fortunately provides gravitas that\nthe film otherwise lacks. No wonder\nthe film was not very well received\neven in Japan itself \u2013 despite a special\nedit that was specifically designed for\nits audiences.\n\n"

    "content": "30 FRIDAY 17 JAN\nGAMES\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\nImran Rashid\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Star in Command\nKhurram Liaqat reviews the mobile Star Command\nDelays, delays and more delays, at\nthe end of which only 30% of the game\nhad been realised. Truly\u2026 the cake\nwas a lie. I\u2019m talking, of course, about\nthe Kickstarter campaign of Star\nCommand, a game that was pitched\nas a strategic space simulator, where\naspiring Captain Kirks would explore\nplanets and fight against aliens,\nall the while chewing bubble gum.\nFor many, Star Command became\nthe typical example of many\nKickstarter campaigns: too ambitious,\nso features had to be cut to meet\nthe deadline. For larger studios,\nthis isn\u2019t a problem, as the features\nwhich were cut are usually unknown.\nWith Kickstarter however, the\ngame and ideas are first pitched to\nthe public, who then invest because\nof feature X, or mechanic Y. Once\ndevelopment is underway and it\nbecomes apparent that feature X\nwon\u2019t work, they have to cut it, much\nto the dismay of investors who feel\nas though they\u2019ve been ripped off.\nUnfortunately, the deadline was\nmissed, features were still cut, and\nwe\u2019releftwith30%ofthegamerealised,\naccordingtothedevelopers.Butatlast,\nit\u2019s here, so let\u2019s see how well it does.\nA couple of loading screens,\ncustomising your Captain, choosing a\nShip, and that\u2019s it: the game has begun.\nIt\u2019s very quick and easy to jump in and\nget your hands dirty. You have aliens\nshooting at you within 5 minutes of\nstarting, so pacing is definitely great.\nHowever, you can\u2019t simply load\nit up and play from where you left\noff while you wait at the dentist\u2019s\nas you\u2019re unable to save the game\nat certain points; usually during\nmissions. So when you sit down to\nplay, be sure to have plenty of time,\notherwise you\u2019re going to have to sit\nthrough parts you\u2019ve already done.\nStar Command primarily consists\nof a series of linear missions, with\na few options near the middle\nportion to do what are, essentially,\nsidequests. The missions themselves\nare typically preceeded with dialogue.\nYou\u2019re given options, but most of\nthe time they don\u2019t affect anything,\nwhich is slightly disappointing.\nThe core gameplay revolves around\nassigning crew members to different\nrooms. There are three types of rooms:\nMedical, Engineering, and Weapons.\nCrew members assigned to Medical\nrooms have a blue shirt and the\nability to heal team-mates, while crew\nassigned to the Engineering rooms\nwear yellow shirts and the ability to\nrepair the ship. Lastly, crew assigned\nto Weapons rooms are outfitted with a\nred shirt and a gun to shoot invaders.\nThere are five main rooms that you\nuse during ship to ship combat. The\nWeapons rooms, the Shield Booster\nroom, the Dodge Generator, and\nthe Medical Bay. When these rooms\nhave crew assigned, a button appears\non your HUD. When they\u2019re fully\ncharged you\u2019re able to activate them.\nUpon activation, the weapon room\nshoots at the enemy ship, and after\nthe completion of a minigame, the\nShield Booster increases shields,\nthe Dodge Generator dodges\none incoming projectile, and the\nmedical bay increases the health\nof all of your crew in your ship.\nIf this is sounding overly complex,\ndon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s very intuitive and\nsimple in actual use, and forms the\nbasis of your decision making as\nCaptain of the ship. For example,\ndo you pull a crew member out of a\nweapon room (which causes weapons\nto charge more slowly) in order to take\nout one of the invaders on your ship?\nOnce you\u2019ve progressed further\nin Star Command, and acquired\nmore crew, which happens pretty\nquickly, and you don\u2019t have to\nconstantly swap them between\nrooms, it becomes somewhat\neasy. Increasing the difficulty\ndoes alleviate this by providing a\nbetter challenge, but not by much.\nIt\u2019s a game that desperately\nneeds another mechanic to add\nan element of strategy, both in\nthe ship-to-ship combat as well\nas against invaders. Perhaps\ncover, or different types of guns.\nAI, hostile and friendly, could\ndefinitely use reworking, as well as\nthe core concept. At the moment,\nyou have to constantly move each\nindividual crew member a few spaces\nforward so that they might aim at\nenemies. This does not make for\nparticularly entertaining gameplay.\nI\u2019d much rather assign \u2018zones\u2019 for\na group of my crew to patrol. This\nwould allow the autonomisation of\nthe more mundane tasks outlined\nabove. The developers could then\nadd in more varied types of AI to\nfight against, so that the element\nof decision making is not lost.\nOccasionally it feels unfocused and\nrushed. For example, the ability to\ncustomise your ship from the meagre\nselection of rooms is so shallow you\nwonder why it\u2019s even there. I can\nonly surmise that they kept 30% of\nall features, rather than keeping the\nfew features that worked, and cutting\nout entirely the ones that didn\u2019t. Their\nintention may be to upgrade and\nimprove these features with updates.\nStar Command does make\nreferences to possible new features,\nfor instance, the ability to beam down\nto planets is, apparently \u201ccoming\nto a Star Command near you\u201d.\nThe controls are good; responsive\nand easy to use, while minimising\nscreen clutter. It works well with a\ntouchscreen, with simple gestures\nto zoom in and out, and tapping on\ncrew members to move them about.\nDespite the repetitiveness and\nease, it does manage to be a fun and\nengaging experience for most of the\ntime due to the very frantic decision\nmaking, where there are no right\nanswers or solutions. The dialogue is\npretty funny, and the universe feels\nrather deep and substantial, with\nmany different and distinct alien races.\nThe story won\u2019t blow minds,\nbut it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t\ntake itself too seriously \u2013 part of\nthe charm that the game offers.\nThere\u2019s also the strange attachment\nyou begin feeling to your crew\nmembers, watching them being\nsucked into the vacuum of space is\nactually saddening. Star Command\ndoes a great job at making\nthe player feel like a Captain.\nStar Command primarily uses\npixel art for most of its graphics,\nand it really looks beautiful, despite\nbecoming overused in recent years.\nAliens are varied in design, and so are\ntheir ships, with menacing, insectile\nAntorians, and the sinister Vox.\nWeapon effects could be improved as\nthey\u2019re fairly bland: simple coloured\nstreaks and circles across the screen.\nThe music is extremely good, and\nhelps add to the deliberate faux-epic atmosphere of the game, as are\nthe sound effects of the weapons.\nWhile the gameplay can be\nimproved, the atmosphere, story and\ndepth of the universe make up for\nit. Hopefully the developers are still\ncommitted to bringing updates out to\nextend the longevity of this title, but\nfor now, this can get old pretty fast.\n\n"

The fund \u2013 together with\nother schemes such as the National\nScholarship Programme, which has\nalso faced recent cuts \u2013 is used by\nuniversities to run both outreach\nevents and schemes to help those\nstudents who are most at risk of\ndropping out of university.\nGiving evidence to the Business,\nInnovation and Skills Committee\nthis Tuesday, David Willetts,\nMinister of State for Universities\nand Science, stressed that while \u201cit\u2019s\nvery important that we spend on\naccess\u201d he could not rule out any\ncuts. This is despite a recent joint\nreport by million+ and the National\nEducation Opportunities Network\n(NEON), concluding that: \u201cStudent\nOpportunity funding serves as an\ninvestment in the nation\u2019s talent\nand future workforce, arguably the\nmost important part of the country\u2019s\ninfrastructure, and that cutting the\nStudent Opportunity allocation\nwould, therefore, be an entirely false\neconomy\u201d.\nRumours of the cuts have lead to\nwidespread criticism. In a statement,\nDr Graeme Atherton, Director of\nNEON, said: \u201cStudent Opportunity\nfunding is an efficient source of\nfinance that follows the student in an\necosystem that gets results, improves\nthe UK\u2019s economic competitiveness\nand offers a long term return on\ninvestment to the Treasury. Any\nmove to reduce or replace Student\nOpportunity funding would result\nin a less effective system and leave\nboth individuals and taxpayers\nworse off over the long term.\u201d Pam\nTatlow, Chief Executive of Million+,\nadded: \u201cTo lose this funding would\nbe a real disaster, especially since the\nwithdrawal of \u00a3100 million from the\nNational Scholarship Programme\na year early. It appears that the\nuniversities who are doing most of\nthe heavy lifting in social mobility\nare the ones paying the price for the\nexpansion of student numbers.\u201d\nThis was a view shared by Professor\nMichael Gunn, Chair of Million+\nand Vice Chancellor of Staffordshire\nUniversity, who added: \u201cAny move to\nreduce this successful area of funding\nwould cast doubt on the sincerity of\npoliticians who, while supporting\nsocial mobility in speeches, would in\npractice be cutting funds that make a\ndifference.\u201d\nIn a letter to the Business Secretary,\nVince Cable \u2013 whose department\nis responsible for higher education\n\u2013 the National Union of Students\nexpressed \u201cstrong opposition to any\nsuch cut in public funding\u201d. The letter\nsays that: \u201cin the wake of cuts to the\nNational Scholarship Programme any\nsuch cut to the Student Opportunity\nfund would be read as a backtracking\nof the government\u2019s commitments to\nsupporting social mobility in favour\nof backfilling the budgetary hole\ncaused by a blank cheque written\nto private providers\u201d. It goes on\nto ask for official \u201cassurance that\n[the Government] will think again\nbefore decimating the capability of\nthe sector to support students from\npoorer backgrounds.\u201d\nThe final funding allocation will\nbe announced later this month in\nCable\u2019s annual grant letter to the\nHigher Education Funding Council\nfor England.\nA report by Million+ and NEON\nhas criticised plans to cut the Student Opportunity Allocation fund\nA\nfter a low turnout at\nTuesday\u2019s Council\nmeeting, the session was\nabandoned since they\nlacked the quorum level of attendance\nrequired for binding votes.\nWhile the missing students may\nhave been excused by the pull of\nexaminations or projects, the Council\nbody missed the chance to pass several\npapers, including the Safe Space\nPolicy \u2013 a policy aiming to create an\nenvironment in Union venues that\nall members, staff and visitors can\nfeel safe in, a paper discussing the\nsupport provided by the Union for\nhalls of residence located further from\nSouth Kensington, and a paper about\nchanging the name of the Union\u2019s\nDeputy President (Finance & Services,\nDPFS) role, prompted by changes to\nthe Sabbatical Officer roles last year.\nThe current DPFS, Kieron Creagh\nsubmitted a paper to Tuesday\u2019s\nCouncil session about the topic\nin which he seemingly dismissed\nthe recommendations of last year\u2019s\nCouncil and Sabbs and proposed that\nthis year\u2019s Sabbatical Officers carry\nout a(nother) review of the sabbatical\nroles with a look to make their own\nrecommendations for next year\u2019s\nsabbatical team.\nAs well as not providing a thorough\nand balanced discussion about the\nrole\u2019s name change in the proposed\npaper, or providing much reference\nto any of the data collected by last\nyears Sabbs, the DPFS also submitted\nthe paper 4 working days after the\ndeadline, just one day before the\nCouncil session.\nWhile the paper was not discussed\nin Council, due to the committee\nbeing three members short of quorum,\ngiving the fact that the next Council\nsession takes place on 11th February\nthere will not be enough time to\ndiscuss the paper before the election\ncycle begins, effectively achieving the\naims of the paper.\nThe idea to change the name of\nthe DPFS stemmed from a paper\ndiscussed at Union Council last year,\nin which the Sabbatical Officers\u2019\nremits were expanded. At the time\nthe previous DPFS stated that he\nbelieved the role was able to expand\ninto it\u2019s additional responsibilities,\nwhich included student development,\naccreditation and the postgraduate\nexperience, however, it was felt that\nthis might need to be accompanied\nby a change in the name of the role to\ninclude the wider remit.\nWhile several names for the\nDPFS were suggested, including DP\nCommunity & Development and\nDP Services and Development, DP\nFinance, Services and Develpoment.\nThere were several reservations\nwith changing the name of the role,\nincluding: discouraging candidates to\napply, misrepresenting the position\nto potential future employers and\nchanging the title of somebody who\nhad already been elected into the\nposition. The decision was instead\ndeferred to the January Council\nsession this year, before the Big\nElections nominations.\nIn response to the article, the DPFS\nsaid: \u201c...Pending the role review now\nincluded in our wider Democracy\nReview, I\u2019m confident this role next\nyear will be accurately described as\n\u2018Finance & Services\u2019...\u201d\nCouncil cancelled - will the\nDPFS role be renamed?\nCops Off Campus \u2013 The Saga Continues\nStudents vow to \u201ckeep the momentum\ngoing\u201d as the Cops off Campus\ncampaign call another demonstration\non 22 January. Three years on from\nthe increase in tuition fees and\nthe student protests that followed,\nuniversity campuses are faced with\nfresh opposition as the recent protests\nagainst police presence on campus\nculminated in thousands of students\nmarching through Bloomsbury.\nCops off Campus demonstrations\nwhich began after the breakup of\nthe Senate House occupations, at\nUCL on December 4 2013, where\nstudents demanded pensions for\noutsourced cleaning staff and to\nsave the University of London Union\nfrom being abolished. Chris Cobb,\nthe university\u2019s Chief Operating\nOfficer, said the occupation: \u201cwas a\ndisgraceful and aggressive act, which\nplaced the safety of [our] staff at risk\u201d.\nThe University of London has taken\nout an injunction preventing \u201cviolent\nand intimidating\u201d protests on its\ncampuses.\nUniversity of London Union\n(ULU) immediately condemned\nthe Police and security staffs for the\neviction, claiming many students\nwere assaulted. Two particularly\ncontroversial videos shows a police\nofficer punching a protester in the\nface and a woman slammed onto\nthe pavement, the videos ended\nup featuring across national media\nincluding The Guardian, and The\nBBC. The Met Police said they had\nnot received any complaints about the\nactions of officers at the protests.\nULU sabbatical officers released a\nstatement stating: \u201cAnyone who thinks\nthat what happened tonight was\nreasonable is not fit to run a university.\u201d\nThe next 48 hours saw further protests\nat Bloomsbury, which resulted in 40\nstudents arrested including a student\nfrom Imperial College London.\nOn December 10, Imperial Student\nUnion Council passed the motion\n\u201cCriminalisation of Student Protest\u201d\nwith an addendum which condemnes:\n\u201cviolent policing\u201d, \u201cdisabling bail\nconditions\u201d and a declared of their\n\u201crefusal to be intimidated by these\nrecent events\u201d. Although, the request\nto provide \u00a3100 of travel expenses to\nstudents to attend campaign meetings\nwas rejected.\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices) Kieron Creagh questioned\nthe relevance of this campaign to\nImperial students, as he believes\nthe majority of Imperial students\nare politically apathetic. The Senate\nHouse occupation demand to keep\nULU open may not relate to many\nstudents on campus since Imperial\nCollege withdrew from University of\nLondon on 8 July 2007.\nHowever, a non-voting member\nargued: \u201cIf the situation were reversed\nand we were being shut down I would\nhope that we would have students\nup and down the country come and\nsupport us\u201d\nThe proposer, Andrew Tranter,\nsaid to Felix: \u201cIn the past few months\nwe\u2019ve seen police throwing punches\nat peaceful protestors, arresting\njournalists and using bail conditions to\nstop students from studying. Imperial\nstudents are affected by this because\neveryone is affected \u2013 what we\u2019re\nwitnessing is nothing short of a violent\nsuppression of our fundamental right\nto protest.\u201d\nDecember 11 was the Cops off\nCampus national day of action that\nhad 4000 students in attendance,\naccording to Channel 4. The protest\nhad minimal police presence, with\nmost keeping a safe distance. While\nthe demonstration was mostly\npeaceful, one bin was set on fire\nand a small group of demonstrators\nattempted to break the injunction and\nenter Senate House.\nStudents marched through the Royal\nCourts of Justice, where they held\na rally in support for Mark Duggan\nduring the inquest. The protest came\nto an end outside ULU at 6pm, with\nno arrests. With mass meetings and\nprotests planned in the New Year,\nstudent protestors want to \u201ctake the\nfight to University management.\u201d\nAamna Mohdin\nNews Editor\n\n"

I click at buttons A and B,\nEvery problem you could ever think of, I can solve,\nBrave is what I am, staring into the face of adversity.\nPrincess Peach needs rescuing?\nFear not, I am here!\nRelax.\nI have the ability, the agility,\nPumped with self-esteem.\nImpossibility?\nImpossible!\nI defy the laws of physics,\nYes, I double jump my way through World Six,\nWith my artillery; fire flowers,\nAnd my sidekick, Luigi.\nVirtual Reality\nHere comes my \u2018Mario-mobile\u2019,\nHe\u2019s my dinosaur. You can call him Yoshi.\nEverything is under control.\nLiterally.\nJust another day in the office,\nMuscles grow very quickly.\nNo need to strain myself in a weight room,\nBody mass times two after eating my favorite Mushroom.\nHardcore gaming. Amazing.\nSadly, back to reality, a light flashes red and yellow.\nA handheld system cries for life.\nOh no! Nintendo!\nDesperation is signified.\nPlease, a moment of silence,\nThe battery of my GameBoy... has just died.\nBy Adam Haltalli\nDayZ, nothing about flowers\nShivering in the cold, dressed in\nan assortment of scavenged clothes\nand gear I wait on top of the hill\noverlooking Balota Airfield. Through\nthe scope of my Mosin, I watch\ndown below hoping to see something\ninteresting or somebody to talk to.\nI see some movement off to my left,\nand excitedly I turn my scope that\nway to see if its a fellow survivor. I\nsigh, only a zombie and return to my\nvigil. Suddenly bullets appear out of\nnowhere, hit me in the back and a\nblack screen appears: You are dead.\nThis is a usual scenario in DayZ,\nthe zombie apocalypse MMO, which\nhas been dominating the Steam sales\nfor about five weeks, ever since its\nearly alpha release. The game itself\nstarted out as a mod for ARMA 2,\nthe hyperrealistic army simulator,\nwhich became immensely popular,\ncatapulting its maker Dean Hall to\ninternet fame. Following several\nknock-offs which disappointed (e.g.\nWarZ), this game has finally been\nreleased. It has now sold more than\na million copies and is the success\nthat it was aways promised to be.\nThe games premise is that you wake\nup with only a flashlight in the post-apocalyptic Chernarus, which has\nbeen ravaged by zombies. Looting\nthe cities, towns and surrounding\nmilitary bases for gear, water and food\nis your only hope. The only goal of the\ngame is to survive as long as possible,\nbecause I promise you will die at\nsome point. Oh I didn\u2019t mention the\nfact that once you die, you start over\ncompletely? Yeah, that\u2019s a bummer.\nNow why would anyone want to\nplay such a horrible game, I hear you\nthink? Because it is just so original\nand different from anything out\nthere. Not only that, but it also does\nit really well. Even though DayZ is\nstill in alpha, with bugs, glitches and\nseveral features missing, this game\nstill offers more than most full games.\nOne of the great feature that this\ngame is its immersion. Without any\nHUD indicators (e.g. life, stamina etc.)\nyou have to rely on the periodic status\nupdates like \u201cI am hungry/thirsty\u201d\nfrom your character. Furthermore the\nfact that your death actually means\nsomething adds tension that very few\ngames possess. Another feature that\nadds to the immersion is the realism\n(apart from the zombies of course) of\nthe game. You need to purify water\nbefore you drink it, you need to make\nsure food isn\u2019t rotten before you eat\nit and your gear degrades naturally,\nin some cases making it completely\nunusable. You actually feel like you are\nbleeding to death while running from\na crazed zombie while wielding a badly\ndamaged axe. In fact it gets so tense at\npoints that I need to take a break to just\ncalm down. That\u2019s how immersive it is.\nAnother great aspect of this game is\nthe multiplayer aspect. The zombies,\nwhile dangerous at the start, become\njust a nuisance once you kit up. It is\nthe other players who are the true\ndanger. Unpredictable, I tend to find\nmore people willing to shoot me than\nactually team up and help me. In one\ninstance this has lead me to being\nhandcuffed, drained of my blood\nand then force fed some disinfectant\nwhich led to my death. Yet for all these\nidiots\u2019 dickishness, they are what keep\nthe game new and interesting. In the\nfuture I am actually hoping that I will\nfind someone genuinely nice, and we\nwill make the most awesomest team,\nand hunt down all those bandits.\nOn the technical side, the\ngraphics, new AI and map are quite\nimpressive. Furthermore the game\nseems relatively well optimised so\nshould run well on most computers.\nAll in all this game is well worth the\n\u00a320 I paid on Steam for it. Furthermore\nconsidering that the price will only be\ngoing up as the game goes through\nalpha, beta and then release stages, you\nmayaswelljustbuyitnow.Furthermore\nif you want someone to play with once\nyou bought the game, don\u2019t hesitate\nto add me on Steam and join the\ngrowing Imperial clan in Chernarus!\nMy steam name is Megglman. I hope\nyou guys will join me on my zombie\nkilling, bandit hunting adventures!\nHere Felix Games presents a poem for you: gamers are artists\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames Editor\n\n"

Have a look around and\nsee if you can notice what\u2019s changed\n(although a lot of it isn\u2019t design\nrelated).\nFor those of you who are\nexperiencing the stress train, fear not,\nthe Union is hosting the originally\nnamed \u201cStress Less\u201d fortnight! Head\nover to the Wellbeing section (pages\n8-9) to find out more. Stress is never\na plesant issue and many students\ncan sucumb to pressure during exam\nperiods, especially in this terrible\nweather. If you do end up having any\nproblems always remember that you\ncan consult your personal tutor, the\nCollege counselling service or the\nhelpful staff at the Union, all of whom\nwill be happy to assist you.\nThere\u2019s some exciting news this\nweek, our hard working Sabbs\napparently do more than spend all day\ndancing on a screen. Thanks to lots\nof work by out Sabbs and Professor\nLord Robert Winston, the issues\nsurrounding the potential problems\nfaceb by international students in the\nface of the looming Immigration Bill\nwill be explored in an inquiry by the\nHouse of Lords Select Committee on\nScience and Technology.

It\u2019s great to head that College\nhas perked up a bit and has started to\ntake more of an interest in the impacts\nit operations and decisions have on its\nstudent stakeholders, especially after\nlast term\u2019s debacle with the handing\nof communications concerning the\ncleaning provision in halls and the\naccomodation license.\nThe panel will discuss a wide-ranging number of topics to do with\nthe Imperial College Residential\nExperience, presenting the results\nto the Provost\u2019s board at the end\nof March. However there are some\nconcerns regarding the length of the\nconsultation. While we understand\nthat it is necessary in order to\nbring needed change to the College\nAccomodation experience, we believe\nthat decisions that have the potential\nto cause major upheaval to the\naccomodation system (and student\nwelfare), should be taken over a longer\nperiod of time, with more stringent\nstudent, warden and welfare feedback.\nRegardless, we welcome the fact\nthat College is staking some action\nto improve the student experience\nin ways that aren\u2019t only focused on\nacademia.\nThe remit of the review is wide\nranging and is expected to also touch\non provisions for students in private\naccomodation.

    "content": "16 FRIDAY 17 JAN\nARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRepublic of the Moon\nS\nince the dawn of humanity,\nmankind\u2019s relationship with\nthe Moon has been a special\none. When our ancestors\nlooked up into the sky, they\nsaw the same heavenly sphere that we\nsee today; unchanging and dynamic,\nfamiliar yet distant, the Moon has\nprovided a wealth of inspiration about\nwhat it means to be human. For many\nyears now space has been seen as the\n\u2018final frontier\u2019, culminating in the first\nmanned moon landings in 1969. While\nenthusiasm for lunar exploration\nseems to have somewhat waned \u2013 the\nlast manned landing was over four\ndecades ago \u2013 as China and India\nbegin to make their mark on the lunar\nsurface, it seems likely that we will see\nrenewed interest in the coming years.\nBut there is a massive question that\nhasn\u2019t yet been answered: now that we\nhave finally reached the Moon, what\ndo we do with it?\nIt is this question that The Arts\nCatalyst is attempting to answer\nwith their new conceptual exhibition\n\u2018Republic of the Moon\u2019. Bringing\ntogether artists whose work resonates\nwith the lunar landscape, The Arts\nCatalyst has taken over an old\nbargehouse, which they have declared\nan Earth-based embassy for their\nnewest republic.\nGiven the current economic and\nenvironmental situation here on\nterra firma, it seems highly likely\nthat there will be some attempt\nwithin this century for international\ncorporations to exploit the natural\nresources the Moon can provide.\nWhile an international treaty was\nsigned in 1979, banning the use of\nthe Moon for exploitative activities, it\nhas never been ratified by the United\nStates government, nor any countries\nthat have launched missions to the\nMoon. With so little to protect it, it\nseems somewhat inevitable that a new\ncolonialism will emerge centered on\nthis celestial body.\nAstronauts are described as\n\u2018emissaries of humanity\u2019, a label which\ncan surely be used to describe the\nrole that artists play in our society.\nTherefore it seems to make perfect\nsense that they are the ones to explore\nwhat the Moon means to us.\nAmerican artist Liliane Lijn\nlooks back to ancient times for her\ninspiration, exploring the link between\nfertility, lunar cycles, and the notion of\nfemininity in her work moonmeme.\nUnrealised as of yet, moonmeme is a\ncomplex work in which Lijn, working\nwith scientists and astronomers,\nplans to project the word SHE across\nthe lunar surface, large enough to be\nseen on earth. As the Moon wanes the\nword fades out, becoming HE before\ndisappearing, linking together the\nmale and female, revealing how one\nis integral to the other. The work is\nrepresented by a real time projection\nof what the word would currently look\nlike on the lunar surface, along with a\nsoundscape created by Lijn, in which\nshe combines mystic quotes about the\nMoon by thinkers such as Pliny with\nrepetition of the word \u2018She\u2019, which has\nbeen used for millennia to describe\nthe Moon. Stretching out the word, it\nbegins to lose its meaning, becoming\na part of the magic of the lunar cycle.\nFurthering the idea of the Moon not\nbelonging to any one nationality, Lijn\nhas furthered the project by expanding\nit to other languages; \u2018Elle\u2019 becomes\n\u2018El\u2019, \u2018Ona\u2019 becomes \u2018On\u2019, and so on.\nThe beauty and mystery of the Moon\nhas inspired a myriad of artistic works,\nand Agnes Meyer-Brandis\u2019 work is\ninformed by one of the earliest works\nof science fiction: Francis Godwin\u2019s\nThe Man in the Moone. Published in\nthe early 17th century, it describes\na man who is carried to the lunar\nsurface by a flock of \u2018Moon Geese\u2019. In\nMeyer-Brandis\u2019 piece, Moon Goose\nColony, the artist attempts to recreate\nthis absurd journey; raising a flock\nof geese from birth, she has trained\nthem as \u2018astronauts\u2019, and they are now\nembarking on a habituation mission\ntogether, spending a year on a Moon\nanalogue in the Italian countryside.\nComprising a short film, in which she\ndocuments the project, along with\nphotos of the geese involved and a\nmodel lunar habitat, the work is full\nof whimsy and wonder, reflecting the\nunique magic of the Moon.\nHowever, Meyer-Brandis also uses\nthe work to raise questions about\nhuman impact on the environment; we\nsee her trying to teach the geese about\navoiding space debris during their\njourney, but for many bird species\ntoday, migrating to their breeding\ngrounds can become as daunting a\nchallenge as being sent into space.\nThis theme, of humans and their\ninteractions with earth and space,\nresounds through the exhibition,\nwhich opened last week with a\n\u2018Manifesto Launch\u2019. Artist group WE\nCOLONISED THE MOON addresses\nthe problem of space tourism and\ncolonisation head on, organising anti-mining protests throughout the run of\nthe exhibition. While this might seem\nlike a far-fetched concept, it is difficult\nnot to be reminded of the current\nprotests surrounding fracking, which\nhas become a talking point only within\nthe last couple of years; is it really so\nabsurd, considering the inexorable\nmarch of technological progress, that\nthe Moon could become the new\narctic circle, or oil sands?\nThis decision about what to do with\nthe Moon is summed up, somewhat\npessimistically, in a piece by WE\nCOLONISED THE MOON, who give\nus the stark choice: \u2018Theme Park or\nQuarry\u2019. But are these really the only\ntwo options that we have? Perhaps\nthis exhibition can inspire a different\nvision of the future.\nThe idea of colonialism can seem\ndifficult to apply to the Moon, but\nwhen we look at historical dominance\nover the territory it seems hard not to\ndraw parallels. Thus far twelve people\nhave walked on the Moon \u2013 all white,\nAmerican men, they can hardly be\ndescribed as emissaries of humanity.\nBut this could soon change. The\nIndian Space Research Organisation\nwas established in 1969, but it was\nnot until recently that the ISRO\nstepped up their space programme,\nsuccessfully launching their first\nlunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, in 2008.\nChallenging the status quo of space\nexploration, it today seems more likely\nthan ever that the main challengers for\ncontrol of the Moon will not be the\nUS and Russia, but India and China.\nChandrayaan translates as \u2018Moon\nVehicle\u2019, which has become the name\nof a joint project between the ISRO,\nartist Joanna Griffin, and students\nat Srishti School of Arts, Bangalore.\nEssentially and outreach programme\nfor the school, Moon Vehicle shows\nhow the prospect of space exploration\ncan inspire an entire generation of\nyoung people.\nKatie Paterson\u2019s work, while directly\ninspired by the Moon, is unique in\nthat it focuses on what is missing as\nopposed to what is actually there. In\nher first piece, Second Moon, a piece\nof lunar rock is being sent by courier\naround the world, at twice the speed\nof the real Moon. We can track this\nartificial moon as it makes its manmade orbit through an app (when I\nvisited it was somewhere in Eastern\nChina); as it passes through cities it\nwill be exhibited at art galleries, before\nmaking its triumphant return to the\nRepublic\u2019s Embassy.\nWhile the work delightfully subverts\nthe idea of a human satellite, it seems\nrather high-concept, and pales in\ncomparison to her second work\nEarth-Moon-Earth, which makes\nuse of \u2018moon bounce\u2019 technology.\nPaterson has converted Beethoven\u2019s\nMoonlight Sonata into morse code,\nbefore transmitting it at the Moon;\nFred Fyles takes a trip to the new Earth-based Lunar Embassy\nthe notes are reflected back to the\nearth, but parts of the information is\nlost in the craters of the lunar surface.\nLacking part of the information, we\nare left with a piece that resembles\nthe original, but is peppered with\ngaps. As the automatic piano plays the\npiece, these discordant pauses create a\ntense, melancholic atmosphere in the\nexhibition space.\nIf one criticism could be levelled\nat the works exhibited thus far, it\nwould be that they are all very high-concept, and removed from the\nindividual relationship we have with\nthe Moon. Luckily we have work from\nphotographer Leonid Tishkov\u2019s series\nPrivate Moon. Tishkov represents the\nhighly personal link each person has\nwith the Moon by carrying around a\nluminous crescent with him. In a series\nof candid shots we see him taking\nhis moon sailing, sleeping next to it,\nand showing it the Moscow skyline.\nIt is difficult to understate the sheer\nbeauty of these pictures; beautifully\nlit, and technically accomplished, they\nmanage to make the Moon a tangible\npresence, rather than a distant rock\nin the sky. These pictures form the\nhighlight of an exhibition that is\nbrimming with excellent pieces,\ncreating a mood that is both sombre\nand intimate.\nArtists provide us with a unique\noutlook on life, and, as mankind\nseems poised to erupt from this\ncrowded earth to reach for the stars,\ntheir voices become increasingly\nimportant. Thus far the Moon is\nviewed through the prism of our\ncurrent Earth-based technology; such\na seismic shift in human migration\nrequires a completely new way of\nthinking, one that scientists have \u2013\nas of yet \u2013 been unable to provide.\nWe can see this attitude in the US\nspace programme, whose spacecrafts\nare given names such as Pioneer and\nProspector, indicating that the Moon\nis just another frontier for the US to\nconquer - an out-dated concept when\none considers the stratospheric rise of\nIndia and China. It is exhibitions such\nas these, in which scientists, engineers,\nand artist work together, that give us\na more suitable context in which to\nplace space travel. When I leave the\nexhibition, I find that the cloudy sky\nwhen I arrived has been transformed\ninto a clear winter\u2019s night; staring up\ninto the sky, I can see the brilliant\nwaxing Moon staring straight back. It\nmay be thousands of kilometers away\nbut \u2013 for tonight at least \u2013 it has never\nseemed closer.\nThe Republic of the Moon is on display\nin Oxo Tower bargehouse, Southbank,\nSE1, from 10th January to 2nd\nFebruary 2014. Entrance free.\nRepublic of the Moon, London, presented by The Arts Catalyst\n\n"

    "content": "18 FRIDAY 17 JAN\nBOOKS\nEditor: Maciej\nMatuszewski, Eva\nRosenthal\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nVithulan Patkunan reviews Donna Tartt\u2019s latest masterpiece\nAnyone familiar with Donna Tartt\nknows that her works take time; her\ndebut, The Secret History, took her\neight years to complete and her following novel, The Little Friend, a decade.\nAnyone familiar with Donna Tartt also\nknows that the wait is completely justified and worth it. The Goldfinch, her\nthird and latest novel is no different\nfrom its predecessors, in both senses.\nFans have been waiting for her next\nnovel for eleven years and it was finally\nunleashed on the world in the autumn\nof 2013. At a hefty 771 pages, the book\nis her longest yet and the world she creates is, no doubt, the richest.\nThe Goldfinch is a tale about a man\u2019s\nlife from teenager to adult, and how\nit completely metamorphosed after\na single piercing event: the loss of his\nmother. After baiting us with a literary\n\u2018cold-open\u2019 \u2013 the protagonist, Theodore Decker, is cooped up in a hotel\nroom in Amsterdam, waiting to discover if his name and implied crimes,\nwhatever they may be, have been outed\nin local news reports \u2013 the narrative\ngoes back in time to tell the story from\nthe beginning.\nIt all starts on a particularly rainy day\nin New York City where Theo and his\nmother are on their way to a parent\nteacher meeting, set up for the thirteen year old on account of him being\nsuspended. Met with some free time\nbefore the meeting, Theo\u2019s mother, a\nlover of art \u2013 and of a specific piece being exhibited that day in particular, decides to visit the museum, unaware of\nthe terrorist bombing set to destroy the\nbuilding. Having been separated from\nhis mother inside, Theo finds himself\namongst rubble and bodies. Here he\nexperiences the single most important\nencounter of his life. An old man, badly\ninjured, communicates with him: incoherent but with moments of extreme\nclarity. He gives him a ring and the\nwords \u201cHobart and Blackwell\u201d\n. He also\nurges him to salvage Fabritius\u2019 master-piece, The Goldfinch, which happened\nto be the very painting that Theo and\nhis mother had come to see.\nTheo leaves the bombsite back to the\nagreed emergency meeting point: their\napartment. He has with him nothing\nbut the painting, the ring and an assured feeling that his worried mother\nwould be waiting for him back home\nwondering what took him so long. The\nwriting of the following events shows\noff Tartt\u2019s genius beautifully, contrasted\nwith the tragic circumstances they de-scribe. The emptiness of the apartment,\nthe nausea of the concussed Theo falling in and out of consciousness and\nperhaps worst of all, his unfailing belief that his mother would walk in any\nmoment now are conveyed painfully\nto the reader; the broken sentences interspersed with long meandering ones\nplace us amidst the confusion, chaos\nand concussion of it all. Perhaps the\nmost disturbing aspect of the situation\nis the indifference and abruptness with\nwhich a couple of social workers let the\nthirteen-year-old Theo Decker, along\nwith the readers, know that his mother\nwas dead: one of the most fascinating\npassages in fiction that isn\u2019t outstanding due to the events that occur, but to\nthe intensity and accuracy with which\nthe emotions are expressed.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say\nthe rest of the book details how Theo\ncopeswiththenews.Ashisalcoholicfa-ther had left him and his mother a long\ntime before, he was suddenly alone and\nshipped from place to place; we see the\nlife of a private school kid in New York\nget turned completely upside down, to\na life where child and drug abuse are\ncommonplace, to a place where nobody\ncared if he came home for the night or\nnot. One of the first things you\u2019ll notice about this book is its wide array of\ncharacters, each with their own quirky,\ncarefully revealed personalities. Having said that, there are really only two\nmain characters in The Goldfinch: Theo\nand his mother. Despite the fact that\nhis mother is alive for only a tiny proportion of the book, the echo of her life\nexists through the pages, through Theo.\nHis actions, his thoughts, the people he\nlikes and dislikes, can all be traced back\nto his mother and to his deep sadness\nat her loss. We learn, with regular drips\nof information, of her past, her tendencies and her small quirks. The way Tartt\nkeeps the character connected to his\npast is startling in its realism. We see\nTheo go through massively contrasting\nsituations, harrowing lows and ecstatic\nhighs; each event molds his personality and we see the results in his future\ndecisions.\nIt is difficult to write about the plot\nof this book without spoiling it some-what. After the opening chapters set in\nNew York and Theo\u2019s mother\u2019s death\n\u2013 which form the premise of the story \u2013 the plot goes at high speed from\none place to the next. Half of the fun in\nreading this book is the anticipation of\nthe plot and where it would lead next\nwith its many twists.\nThere are a few major themes running through this book, one of which is\nthe theme of antiques. Theo becomes\nfascinated with The Goldfinch painting\nhe takes from the destroyed art gallery\nand then with furniture and antiques\nin general. Perhaps after witnessing the\ntransience of human life, he takes solace in the longevity and assuredness of\nancient pieces of art. James Hobart of\n\u201cHobart and Blackwell\u201d\n, which we find\nout to be an antiques store, is to whom\nTheo is led after heeding the injured old\nman\u2019s words. Affectionately called \u2018Hobie\u2019\n, the giant of a man becomes Theo\u2019s\nguardian and his teacher in all things\nantique. Theo\u2019s relationship with Hobie\nis one of the few real connections we\nsee him have; his exchanges and presence give Theo (and the readers) an anchoring in the otherwise choppy waters\nof his life.\nPerhaps one of the most intriguing\ncharacters in the book is that of Boris:\na misfit Russian kid Theo befriends at\nschool after his mother\u2019s death. An alcoholic from age ten, Boris sets Theo\noff into a routine of alcohol, cigarettes,\nglue-sniffing and shoplifting. Boris\u2019\ncasual criminal behavior, suffering of\nabuse at his father\u2019s hand and exposure to an adult\u2019s world at too early an\nage makes him a tragic yet interesting\ncharacter, not least due to his genuine\ncaring for Theo. The inevitable dependency on drugs that Theo develops\nbecomes a source of some of the more\ndepressing but beautiful passages in the\nbook. Theo\u2019s musings and frustrations\nat the \u201chuman predicament\u201d during\nhis drug fuelled highs and withdrawal\ndepressions create an emotional depth,\nwhile the unfolding of the story brings\na sense of fast-paced action, all leading up to the events of the \u2018cold open\u2019\nin Amsterdam and the intense ending.\nDonna Tartt has always had an ability to express hauntingly familiar yet\nseemingly inexplicable emotions in\nan exact and precise way, an ability to\nexplain abstract concepts in a tangible\nfashion. This novel is no different, in\nfact it seems Tartt has honed this skill\neven further to the point where she has\ncreated moments where you truly and\nstrongly relate to Theo.\nA passage from the book where an art\nconnoisseur describes The Goldfinch,\nthe painting, comes to mind when\ndescribing the novel itself. \u201cThere\u2019s a\ndoubleness.

The first\nteam was hosting their competition\nat Trent Park Equestrian Centre\nand the second team were visiting\nSouthampton.\nDespite a few mishaps in the\nmorning before the competition, the\nfirst team was ready for the start of\nthe competition on time. The team\nwarmed up the dressage horses for the\nother teams to see. Franklyn, Hope,\nLucy and Samba were all impeccably\nbehaved and so the first riders on\neach horse began their allotted warm-up time. Andre Wilmes, a returning\nteam member who had unfortunately\nsprained his ankle two days before the\ncompetition but was determined to\nride, rode Samba beautifully and they\nachieved the best score of the whole\nday. Team Captain, Rachel Gregory,\nriding Lucy and Natasha WoodsKreisler riding Hope also managed to\nride the best dressage tests on their\nhorses. Our fourth team member,\nLeila Royle-Davies rode a beautiful\ntest on her horse Franklyn, but was\nunfortunate to only be placed second\non her horse. Once the dressage tests\nwere complete the jumping course\nwas put up, whilst the scores were\ncounted. We were in the lead after the\ndressage, on a score of 19 penalties,\nwith our closest rivals Royal Holloway\non 62 penalties. The jumping course\nwas as big as the rules allow, and again\nthe team warmed up the jumping\nhorses before Rachel was the first to\ncompete on Maximus, Andre was\nsecond on Brazil, Natasha was third\non Avignon and Leila was the last to\nride Teak. Andre was judged to have\nridden the best on Brazil on so he won\noverall. Rachel came second on her\njumping horse and was placed third\noverall. Natasha scored 9 penalties on\nher horse and was placed sixth, and\nLeila scored 22 penalties. The team\nresults were announced as well, and\nwith all four riders\u2019 scores counting,\nwe had won on 55 penalties. The\nUniversity of Kent was second on\n108 penalties, Royal Holloway was\nthird on 110 penalties and LSE were\nfourth on 302 penalties. After this\ncompetition, Imperial is leading the\nmini-league, with Rachel individually\nsecond and Andre third.\nThe second team\u2019s competition at\nSouthampton was run under exactly\nthe same format, with the dressage\ntests in the morning and jumping in\nthe afternoon. In the dressage Sara\nWieclawska was the first to ride her\nhorse, Becky Salen was second to\nride her horse, Sorin Popa third and\nLucie Walder fourth. All the dressage\ntests were ridden extremely well,\nand the team was in third place after\ndressage. In the show-jumping Becky\nrode a fantastic clear round, Sara was\nunlucky to have one fence down and\nboth Lucie and Sorin unfortunately\nhad two refusals. Overally, Becky\nwas placed 7th, Lucie was placed\n8th and the team was placed third\noverall, an improvement on their first\ncompetition.\nIf you would like to try horse-riding,\nwe are holding a Give It A Go session\nfor beginner riders on 29th January.\nFor more information email riding@\nic.ac.uk.\nINSIDE\nIC Snooker register first ever individual medal\nIC Taekwondo\nproduce strong\nshowing\nRachel Gregory describes the action\nIC RIDING AND POLO\nThe first fencing premiership\nBUCS tournament was held in\nOxford in December, where the\nhome crew, as well as Cambridge,\nUCL, Bristol and the mighty\nImperial crossed swords once\nagain.\nFor two days, the teams\ncompeted to take lead in the\nrace for the coveted league title.\nSaturday started with an early 9am\nmatch against Bristol. Winning the\nweapon\u2019s order toss, we decided\nto start with our foilists who were\nso pumped they had begun their\nwarm-up the night before.\nDespite a tricky opposition, the\nteam pulled off a promising 45-42 win. Sabre was up next, and\nwe decided to sharpen the game.\nA ruthless and almost perfect\nperformance by Chris \u201c8pak\u201d\nLawrence lead to a 45-15 sweep,\nand left no time for the opposition\nto realise that their match was\ngetting out of hand. This inspired\nthe epee to finish off the match,\nscoring 41 points and giving\nthe newly named \u201cPimperials\u201d a\ncomfortable win, 131-102.\nNext on the list was the talented\nCambridge team, an old rival that\nhas been known to give Imperial\nfencers a hard time\u2026 Foilists were\nput up first and trailed by a few\nhits against a strong side. However\nas the match progressed, Imperial\nfencer \u201cSuper-Soren\u201d Pfitzner got\nincreasingly angry, leaving no\nchances for a terrified Cambridge\nteam. A beautiful finish by Glen\n\u201cThe Beast\u201d Ostacchini turned the\ntables round and ended the match\nin a 44-42 win. Sabre was up next\nand felt the pressure to perform\nafter the textbook foils win.\nHowever, the sabreurs were too\nproud to be outdone by another\nweapon and slashed their way\nthrough the opposite side to fetch\na brutal 45-18 win. This provided a\nprecious lead against Cambridge\u2019s\ntricky Epee team. The epeeists did\nnottakethisasasigntorestthough,\nand battled to the finish getting an\nimpressive 35 hits. This totalled to\na 124-105 for Pimperials, showing\nthe opposition who was really\ndominating the tournament.\nAfter a long tiring day of winning,\nthe Imperial fencers gathered\ntheir forces to fight the Blues for\nSaturday\u2019s last match. To the keen\nImperial foilists\u2019 disappointment,\nthe weapon\u2019s order toss was lost so\nthe sabreurs reluctantly warmed\nup to start the match. Just kidding,\nthey absolutely could not wait to\nkick some butt. The trio sharpened\ntheir swords and slew the Oxford\nsabreurs 45-15 with a star indicator\nby Didier \u201cOld-School\u201d Nohlmans.\nAs Oxford\u2019s strengths lying in Foil\nandEpee,thenextmatchpromisedto\nbe challenging. However Pimperial\nfoilists kept it together, and with\nsome swift attacks from Clyde \u201cThe\nBeard\u201d Fare, reached a safe 36 hits\nagainst their on-form adversaries.\nThe tension was at its peak as Epee\nstarted the last leg, needing 25 hits\nto win against the Blues. A difficult\nstart showed that it was not going to\nbe an easy finish. Wanna-be epeeists\nCamille Van Hoffelen and \u201cM-Iron\nMan\u201d Ratneswaran used their sabre\nspeed to confuse the opponents,\npushing the Oxford team\u2019s pride a\nlittle further into the ground with\nMaiyuran\u2019s toe shattering foot flick.\nIn the second half of the match\nhowever, Oxford changed tactics\nand played time. They were trying\nto avoid being hit, betting that their\nanchor would be able to catch it\nall up against our second-finisher.\nLittle did they know that Jonathan\n\u201cIce-Croft\u201d Ashcroft was the coolest\nman alive, and slowly took apart\nthe top Oxford epeeist\u2019s game in a\nthrilling penultimate bout. This gave\nthe leverage for Harry \u201cThe Flick\u201d\nGulliver to finish off the match 45-25, winning overall by one point. Or,\nas we like to call it, \u201cone-ing\u201d against\nthe Blues.\nAfter a well-deserved lie-in on\nSunday, Pimperials got ready for the\nlast match of the tournament against\nan impressive, newly promoted UCL\nteam. Sabre was set to start. The on-form UCL side fenced really well, but\nthe sabre trio kept focus and won a\ncomfortable 45-25. Epee was granted\nthe arrival of resident star Jamie \u201cThe\nHulk\u201dSimpsondirectfromBratislava\nU20 World Cup. His intimidating\nshouts and signature Green Mask\nspurred the team forwards. Harry\n\u201cThe Flick\u201d Gulliver proceeded to\ndestroy the opposition with his\nflawless technique in a 12 hit run,\nleading to a huge 38 points against\nan international standard UCL side.\nThis left foil with a tense finishing\ntask. A combative UCL side grinded\naway hits and kept up the suspense\ndown to the last few seconds.\nDespite the building tension, a solid\nperformance from \u201cSuper-Soren\u201d\nand \u201cIs it a sabreur, is it a foilist, is\nit an epeeist, no, it\u2019s M-Iron Man\u201d\ncarried the Imperial team 2 points\nfrom the win in the penultimate\nbout. This paved the way for Glen\n\u201cThe Beast\u201d Ostacchini to shine at\nthe tensest of moments and take the\nwin by scoring 4 consecutive parries\nover the UCL finisher. Pimperial\nwon the last match of the weekend\n118-114, coming back home with\na clean sheet and hunger for many\nmore.\nCamille van Hoffelen\nIC Fencing\nNathaniel Gallop\nIC Taekwondo\nLast weekend saw Ethos sports\ncentre nearly full to capacity as over\none hundred and sixty competitors\ndescended on Imperial College to\ntake part in the Imperial College\nOpen.\nNow in its second year, the\nImperial College Open has become\na major event in the competitive\nyear for many university clubs, with\nstudents from as far as Newcastle\nand Sheffield flocking to South\nKensington to participate. Over\n130 fights, across 35 different\nweight and class categories took\nplace throughout the day, posing a\nsignificant challenge for the largely\nstudent-run competition.\nDespite these hurdles, Imperial\nCollege Tae Kwon Do club\n(ICUTKD) dominated proceedings,\ntaking home a staggering 21 medals\n(9 bronze, 6 silver and 6 gold) from\na pool of 25 competitors, across all\nweight and skill categories. This\nwas the highest number of medals\nof any university club, and enough\nto ensure the newly inaugurated\n\u2018Imperial Award\u2019 remains firmly in\nthe hands of Imperial College in its\nfirst year.\nWe would like to take this\nopportunity to thank all of the\npeople who volunteered on the\nday, helping to ensure the smooth\nrunning and ultimate success of the\nImperial College Open. Thank you\nto the British Student Tae Kwon Do\nFederation (BSTF), the Red Cross,\nSport Imperial and the Ethos staff,\nwho were all instrumental in the\norganisation of the event. We would\nalso like to thank our instructor,\nMaster Reza Saberi and our coaches\nfor their guidance and support over\nthe last few months.\nWith the Imperial College Open\n2013 being a huge success and a\nmilestone in terms of our sporting\nachievement, we realise that there is\nstill much work to be done this year.\nWe hope that with this experience\nunder out Tae Kwon Do belts, we\ncan go forward to achieve bigger\nand better things at the Student\nNationals and the Imperial College\nOpen 2014.

    "content": "39\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 17 JAN\nSPORT\nIC put Bristol mini-tour to full use\nAt 2pm on Friday 22nd November\nthe first impatient members of the\nmini-tour arrived in the union, for\na live #AskMattCann. Like moths\nto a flame the remaining 34 touring\nrangers arrived to finally set eyes on\nthe fabled tour tops. A rather fetching\nyellow and black number had been\nhand-picked from the literally tens of\nother options, and was met with looks\nof disgust from some and approving\ndiscussions of where it sat on the\nICUAFC Kit Pengness scale from\nothers.\nOnce everyone had arrived we\nmade the short trip to Paddington\nto board what rumours had said was\nthe busiest train in the country. These\nviscous rumours were soon shown\nto be true and a hasty free first class\nupgrade for half the team was the\nonly way to get standing room, let\nalone an excellently reserved seat. The\nunsuspecting members of the First\nClass quiet carriage were shown a\nwonderful display of train box, one of\nthe harder disciplines of the game.\nAfter arriving in Bristol 1 hour and\n43 minutes after leaving Paddington,\nwe made our way to the hostel, which\nwas a literal stone\u2019s throw from the\ndestination for that evening, Pryzm.\nDespite being voted the second worst\nstudent night in the UK, IC were\nnot to be disheartened and entered\nlooking for a stage to dominate. After\nkicking up a fuss about the dire lack of\na stage, Frosty had a tiny disagreement\nwith the door staff and promptly put\nhimself under house arrest.\nThe game day was finally upon us,\nbut the club Pimp had forgotten all his\nessential kit so a last minute dash to\nSports Direct was undertaken, and a\nvery late decision to purchase a ball\nwould later be totally vindicated.\nThe bus journey took in some\nof Bristol\u2019s more cultured sights,\nincluding the cathedral, a Banksy and\nthe museum, before dropping us near\nthe middle of nowhere. It was here\nhowever we discovered that Georgie,\none of the netball social secs, had had\nso much fun at a previous football\nevent that she followed us the 120 odd\nmiles. Creepy.\nMinds turned back to the football\n- we were ready to bring Tiki-Taka\n(pronounced Punt and Rush) to\nBristol. However the pitch turned\nout to be on the side of a hill with\nmore bobbles than over the road at\nHarlington. This wasn\u2019t ideal for the\nhigh-tempo pass and move football\nTim Beasley wanted to impose on the\nsquad and so IC reverted to Tiki-Taka.\nTo match the disarray of the pitch\nthe opposition provided a flat football\n(hence the excellent purchase just\nhours earlier), and after at least an\nhour, some nets. The light was fading\nbut that was no matter, and the match\nbegan.\nIt was a very cagey affair with\nneither team able to keep possession,\nbut both defences holding strong.\nThe game needed a goal badly and\nImperial aren\u2019t ones to disappoint. A\ncorner was promptly conceded and\nno-one picked up a runner from deep\nwho buried his header into the roof of\nthe net. University of Bristol Captain\u2019s\nSelect XI 1 \u2013 0 ICUAFC. Disaster. IC\nresponded by winning a throw-in deep\nin the Bristol half and exploited Miles\nCovers\u2019 long throw with the help of\nthe tall team, Dom Wood scoring with\na looping header over the keeper. Cue\npandemonium in the stands and a\npitch invasion.\nWithin minutes it was 2-1, Guy\nFrankel scoring after some good work\nfrom Julian Iacoponi on the right\nsparking a second pitch invasion.\nThings were going far too easily for IC.\nA mistake from Frosty at the back let\nthe Bristol Striker get one-on-one with\nSam who was beaten with an elegant\ndink which received a well-deserved\nround of applause from the travelling\nfans. Minutes later and an even worse\nmistake from Frosty put Bristol clean\nthrough again to put IC 3-2 down.\nCalamity. Julian came to the rescue\nonce again and levelled the game at\n3-3 on the stroke of half time. What a\ngame. The only thing that could make\nit any better would be 8 more goals\u2026\nImmortals\nbarely beat\nBears\nThe Immortals returned to\nHarlington to take on the Royal\nHolloway Bears in another tense\ngame of American football.\nGoing into the weekend the\nImmortals were undefeated, having\nonly been scored against once by the\nKCL Regents. The Bears, who were\nalso unbeaten, looked as though they\nwould be the toughest opposition\nyet, with playmakers on both\noffense and defense. This match was\nimportant to both teams as whoever\nwon would be placed at the top of\nthe London Conference.\nThere was tension in the air as the\nmatch kicked off, both teams knew\nwhat was on the line and both were\nclearly up for a fierce game. The\nImmortals kick off team chased\ndown field to make the tackle.\nThe game was tougher than the\nImmortals has expected, the Bears\nhad talent in all areas of the field and\nhad clearly greatly improved from\nprevious years.\nIt was only minutes into the first\nquarter when the Bears got their first\nbig play; a screen pass gave them a\nhuge gain, positioning them only\none yard from the goal line. They\nthen managed to run the ball in for\na touchdown, only the second to\nbe scored against the Immortals\u2019\ndefense this season. They converted\ntheir PAT attempt and the score\nstood at 7-0.\nThe Immortals were shaken, never\nbefore this season had they been\nbehind another team. The offense\ntook the field, but the Bears defense\nproved too much, forcing a punt\nfrom the Immortals. The Bears\noffense wasted no time getting back\ninto their rhythm and drove the ball\ndeep into the Immortals\u2019 half. A deep\npass from their quarterback scored\ntheir next touchdown, then with\nanother successful conversion the\nscore was 14-0, and the Immortals\nhad been stunned.\nThe first quarter came to a close,\nand as the sides switched ends\nthere was seemed to be a change in\nmentality from the home team. They\nopened the second quarter hitting\nthem hard with big run plays, with\nthe thought of losing their fuel for\naggression. The Immortals worked\ntheir way deep into the Bears\u2019 half,\nand then Duncan Mackinnon ran in\nfor a touchdown from just yards out.\nThe coaches opted for an extra point\nattempt, which was converted as\nMarcus Stead-Hall ran into the end\nzone. The gap was then decreased to\n14-8.\nThe Immortals\u2019 defense stepped\nup their game and managed to\nstop some of the Bears\u2019 key plays,\nallowing the home offense to take\nthe field once more before the half\nwas over. Again the ball was taken\ninto the Bears\u2019 half, and then a deep\npass from Toby Sinclair to Tino\nMillar was caught in the end zone.\nOnce more Marcus ran in on the\nextra point attempt, setting the score\nat 14-16.\nThe Immortals had the lead going\ninto halftime, but the players were\nwell aware that the game was far\nfrom over, the Bears had proved that\nthey were capable of scoring and had\nthe ability to stop the Immortals\u2019\noffense.\nThe third quarter was slow, both\nsides driving the ball but neither\nable to make the final push to score\na touchdown. The next change in\nscore came in the fourth quarter. The\nBears\u2019 quarterback read the defense\nand kept the ball, running in for a\ntouchdown. They tried to get the\nextra point, but were unsuccessful.\nThe Immortals offense returned\nto the field with the score at 20-16.\nThe Bears stopped the Immortals\nadvancing down the field and the\nhome defense had to get on the field\nand stop the Bears scoring again. Big\ntackles from the Immortals pinned\nback the Bears, stopping them from\nrunning down the game clock, and\nimportantly giving the Immortals\u2019\noffense one more chance to score.\nThey were back on the field with\nbarely any time to spare. If the\nImmortals were going to remain\nundefeated, they would have to\nscore, and fast. The offense drove\ndown the field, and with time\nrunning out Toby found Tino with\na deep pass, which was caught on\nthe one-yard line. There were merely\nseconds remaining when the players\nlined up in their positions, and with\njust 3 seconds left when the ball was\nsnapped, Toby snuck into the end\nzone to score a touchdown. The\nImmortals\u2019 sideline erupted. They\nhad come from behind to win the\ngame 20-22, beating their hardest\nopposition of the season so far.\nMost valuable player awards were\ngiven to Tino Millar for his great\ncatches, Toby Sinclair for controlling\nthe offense, Jordan Douglas and\nJoe Downey for their great work on\nthe offensive line, and to Guillame\nFontan for his big plays from the\ndefensive line.\nThe unbeaten record still stands,\nand is now set at four games.\nHenry Badham\nIC American Football\nMan of the mini-tour Matt Cann gives his account\nA disastrous change of goalkeeper\nled to an early flurry of goals, by\nwhich point the floodgates had been\nwell and truly opened. Some more\nfootball was played and the final score\nwas irrelevant. IC had got the all-important moral victory and that was\nall that mattered. Matt Cann was voted\nplayer of tour, an award all too familiar\nfor him. We headed back to the hostel\nwith some dignity intact, ready to be\nlost for good later that night.\nAfter already having sampled the\nworst club in Bristol, IC thought it\nwise to keep low quality in mind and\nvisited Walkabout, ranked 6, followed\nby Syndicate, second in the worst\nnights in Bristol (The Tab Bristol,\n2013).\nAgain IC weren\u2019t troubled by\nthe poor quality of nightlife - we\nknew how to make anywhere good.\nChannelling Shakers, we headed forth\nbut were stopped in our tracks, much\nlike Groves, when a photo booth was\nspotted. Several hundred photos and\nmillions of shapes later the night\nlooked to be coming to a premature\nend. However IC weren\u2019t quite\nfinished and Kebab U Like It wasn\u2019t\nready for what was about to happen.\nYAYA! YAYA YAYA! YAYA YAYA!\nYAYA YAYA TOURE! KOLO! KOLO\nKOLO! KOLO KOLO! KOLO KOLO\nTOURE! 20 minutes later and it was\ntime to call it a night.\nSunday arrived and IC departed,\nmaking it back in time to catch the last\n\u00be of Super Sunday with heads full of\nmemories of a successful domination\nof Bristol.\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\nICUAFC\n\n"

The new\ncentre will be artfully named the\nResearch Institute into Trustworthy\nIndustrial Control Systems and will\nfocus on preventing cyber attacks on\nlarge infrastructure such as nuclear\npower and the national rail.\nProfessor Chris Hankin, director of\nthe new institute, said: \u201cOur industrial\ncontrol systems are vital for running\nmost of the industrial processes that\nunderpin modern society. From\nelectricity generation to making sure\ntrains run on time, these systems are\nvital to our everyday lives, but more\nwork needs to be done to determine\nhow vulnerable they are to threats\nfrom cyber-attack.\u201d\nAs engineers have sought\nmore realtime information from\ninfrastructure, such as railways,\nsystems are become increasingly\ninterconnected, leaving them with\nmore vulnerabilities. As well as\nattacks on infrastructure, the institute\nwill investigate the impact that a cyber\nattack on a single firm can have in\ntriggering a domino effect on other\nbusinesses further downstream.\nThe threat and destructive potential\nof a cyber attack is very real. As Prof.\nHankin pointed out, commenting\non the new centre: \u201cIn 2007, parts\nof Estonia ground to a halt when it\nexperienced a \u2018denial of service\u2019 cyber-attack, overloading servers, which\nlead to a temporary government\nshutdown. While this is an extreme\nexample, it highlights how vulnerable\ncountries are to these types of threats.\u201d\nRory Fenton\nReporter\nNew funding for UK research institutions has been announced by the\nMinister of State for Universities and\nScience, David Willetts. During a\nvisit to Imperial College last Friday,\nWilletts announced the formation of\nnineteen new Centres for Doctoral\nTraining (CDT) which will be funded\nthrough the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council (EPSRC)\nwith the money ultimately sourced\nprimarily from industry partners.\nCDTs are an increasingly common\nmeans of providing PhD studentships \u2013 with each centre offering a\nfour year course in a particular area\nof science and engineering, focusing\non research but also including taught\nelements.\nWilletts was keen to stress that:\n\u201cthe Government will be investing\nin a further 900 students through an\nadditional 19 Centres for Doctoral\nTraining (CDTs), bringing our\ntotal investment in CDTs to \u00a3390\nmillion\u201d. Professor David Delpy, Chief\nExecutive of the EPSRC, added that:\n\u201cthese new CDTs will provide training\nand advances in research in many\nareas of science and engineering\nincluding quantum technologies,\nmanufacturing, robotics, energy and\nsustainability and bring the total\nnumber of Centres funded in this\nround to ninety one.\u201d\nThree of the centres \u2013 focusing\non Plastic Electronic Materials,\nSustainable Civil Engineering and\nNuclear Engineering \u2013 will be based\nat Imperial. In a statement Professor\nJames Stirling, College Provost, said:\n\u201cSecuring a further three CDTs to\nadd to the seven already awarded\ncements Imperial\u2019s position as a\nleader in postgraduate education and\nresearch, helping to produce the next\ngeneration of scientists, engineers\nand industrialists who will drive the\nUK\u2019s economic recovery.\u201d\nWhile touring the Department\nof Aeronautics, Willetts also\nannounced the formation of a new\nNational Wind Tunnel Facility,\nwhich will bring together Imperial,\nOxford, Cambridge and four other\nuniversities. The College has a long\ntradition of wind tunnel research with\nBluebird-Proteus CN7, the car which\nbroke the land speed record in 1964,\nhaving been tested here. Imperial will\nreceive \u00a34million of the \u00a313.3million\ndedicated to this new project, which\nwill be used to improve the its five\nexisting wind tunnels.\nProfessor Jonathan Morrison, Chair\nof Experimental Fluid Mechanics\nin the Department of Aeronautics,\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNews Editor\nMinister announces new\nresearch opportunities\nDavid Willetts uses visit to Imperial to announce the\ncreation of new Doctoral Training Centres\nsaid: \u201cThe Government\u2019s much\nneeded investment in the nation\u2019s\nleading wind tunnel facilities will\nhave a transformative effect and\ndrive innovation across a broad\nrange of sectors in a variety of\nfields. At Imperial, this will help us,\nfor instance, to design bridges that\ncan better withstand wind induced\nvibrations and more efficient wind\nturbines, and to develop better\naircraft wings that improve fuel\nefficiency.\u201d Stirling added: \u201cImperial\u2019s\nwind tunnels have historically played\na pivotal role in the development of\nFormula One car design, with many of\nour graduates going on to important\ncareers in the industry. New funding\nwill help secure our global advantage\nin this field, fostering greater capacity\nand driving forward much needed\nresearch in a range of areas, from\ngreen energy to more fuel efficient\naircraft.\u201d\nWilletts emphasised the economic\nimportance of the new funding,\nsaying: \u201cThis new investment will\nsupport research that is vital to the\nUK economy, including developing\nthe next generation of fuel efficient\nheavy goods vehicles. This will create\nhuge energy savings to businesses,\nas well as bringing environmental\nbenefits. It is pioneering work that\nwill help the UK get ahead in the\nglobal race.\u201d\nThe Universities Minister, David Willetts, visited the College\u2019s Aeronautics Department last Friday\n\n"

R. R. Tolkien (novel)\nStarring: Ian McKellen, Martin\nFreeman, Richard Armitage, Orlando\nBloom, Evangeline Lilly, Lee Pace,\nLuke Evans, Benedict Cumberbatch,\nSylvester McCoy\nRuntime: 161 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nDwarves are useless and can\u2019t do any-thing, whilst Wood Elves and their\nfluid, slick gymnastic movements are\nawesome and humans haven\u2019t yet had\nthe chance to shine: that\u2019s the message to take away from Desolation of\nSmaug, the second entry to Peter Jackson\u2019s overblown Hobbit trilogy.\nIt\u2019s a good thing we got all of the introduction out of the way in the first\nfilm. Remember how it took nearly\nforty minutes for Bilbo Baggins (Mar-tin Freeman, still going strong and reliable as the protagonist) to make up\nhis mind about the Dwarves\u2019 quest\nto take back their home from an evil\ndragon? Now the Dwarf Fellowship\nand Bilbo are well on their way to the\nLonely Mountain where the deadly\nSmaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) awaits. During the jour-ney, Gandalf, perhaps the only useful\nmember, decides to leave them to fend\nfor themselves whilst he ventures into\na scary dark worn-down castle to hunt\ndown some clues that may or may not\nhave to do with a certain dark overlord\nwho may or may not be rising. There\nis also the sinister underlying subplot\nof the infamous golden Ring and Bilbo\u2019s growing attachment and reliance\nfor the object, something that can lead\nto no good given how much the audience knows about the Ring and its\ndark powers.\nCue the spiders, Orcs and other ugly\nantagonists until the band of brothers whose names or faces you will\ncertainly not remember from the first\nfilm (there are thirteen of them...I can\nbarely remember the names of the\nThree Musketeers) are rescued by the\nWood Elves. Enter Legolas (Orlando\nBloom, looking very serious as though\nhe means business throughout the\nmovie), and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly,\nwho nails the posh English accent),\nboth characters who don\u2019t even feature in the original novel, plus a hint\nat a possible love triangle, as Tauriel is\ntaken by , Kili (Aidan Turner) an eligible Dwarf who she claims is taller than\nmost Dwarves she\u2019s seen.\nAs if the trilogy wasn\u2019t long enough,\n(this second installment alone lasts\nover two and a half hours) the lengthy\ndiversion into the Wood Elves\u2019 livelihood plus an extensive tour of their\ninsanely decorated palace may seem\nunnecessary, but it\u2019s with these mystical creatures the fantasy action\nstarts. There\u2019s something refreshing\nto be seen in individuals who know to\ntake care of themselves, and between\nLegolas and Tauriel, with their quality archery skills and knife-wielding\nabilities, the two of them slay a vast\nnumber of antagonists in an extended\nsequence that comes mostly as relief:\nreassurance that the good guys aren\u2019t\nso buggered after all.\nJackson\u2019s vision of Middle Earth is\nstill one to behold, as the many different settings come to life in the film\u2019s\nmany, many grand sweeping shots,\nmost noticeably once Smaug enters\nthe picture. The endless treasures that\nfill the Lonely Mountain is gold, more\ngold, then even more gold, as poor\nBilbo is tossed into the ring to face\noff with the dragon in the film\u2019s tense\nbut equally funny exchange between a\nteeny Hobbit and the mighty dragon.\nIt\u2019s down to Freeman\u2019s likablility as\nan unexpected hero and his desperate attempts to outsmart and distract\nthe dragon that works to the film\u2019s\nadvantage.\nEven if your concentration drifts in\ncertain parts, even when Stephen Fry\nand Luke Evans turning up as human\ncharacters who will be put to more\nsubstantial use in the third and final film can\u2019t hold your attention for\nlong, Smaug will wake you back up\nand make the whole movie-going experience worthwhile. Designed with\nmotion-capture and voiced by the\nnation\u2019s favourite Sherlock Holmes,\nSmaug alone is the best use of CGI in\nthe Hobbit franchise so far, and given\nhow the film wraps up with an exciting cliffhanger with one major loose\nend relating to the fate of the dragon,\nwe\u2019ll certainly get to see him again and\nit will be a visual treat once more for\nsure.\nBeing the middle film, there are\nmany hanging strands that need ad-dressing. What is Gandalf so afraid\nof? What will become of the dwarves,\nthe humans and the elves? And will\nLee Pace, as Legolas\u2019 father Thranduil,\nshow up once more with his excessive wardrobe and head accessory that\nputs the fashion of Vatican to shame?\nWe will all just have to wait until December 2014, when the Hobbit trilogy\nwill come to a close, more than a decade after the Lord of the Rings took the\nworld by storm.\n2014 Golden Globes\nBest Motion Picture (Drama): 12 Years a Slave\nBest Motion Picture (Comedy): American Hustle\nBest Actor (Drama): Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club)\nBest Actress (Drama): Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine)\nBest Actor (Comedy): Leonardo DiCaprio (The Wolf of Wall Street)\nBest Actress (Comedy): Amy Adams (American Hustle)\nBest Supporting Actor: Jared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club)\nBest Supporting Actress: Jennifer Lawrence (American Hustle)\nBest Director: Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity)\nBest Screenplay: Spike Jonze (Her)\nBest Original Score: Alex Ebert (All is Lost)\nBest Original Song: Ordinary Love (Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom)\nBest Animated Feature Film: Frozen\nBest Foreign Language Film: The Great Beauty\nWhy we should join the Oscar for Best\nActor and Best Actress into one award.\nThere are a many strange things about\ntrying to decide who is the \u2018best actor\u2019\nbecause whatever performance they\ngive is through the lens of a director\nand rewritten by the editor. We also\ndon\u2019t know what they set out to do. For\nexample, in Dr. Strangelove, George C.\nScott, wanted to play the role of General Buck Turgidson straight, but was\ntricked into performing over the top\n\u201cpractice takes\u201d for comedic effect by\nKubrick. The main point is that \u201cBest\nActor\u201d sounds objective, when really it is a completely subjective affair,\nalongside the fact that the academy\nwho votes on these matters may well\nhave vested interests in improving\nrevenue of their own films.\nThere is however another anomaly\nin way these awards are designed and\nthat is that there are gender boxes for\nthe acting awards, but for none of the\nothers. We don\u2019t see best female edi-tor, or best female VFX, or best female\nDirector.\nI have talked previously about the\nproblems that arise from the lack of\nfemale directors in the industry and\nI think giving female talent more airtime can only be a good thing. HOWEVER I cannot think of anything more\npatronising than saying to female directors they are going to be in a new\n\u201clittle league\u201d for the girls. This isn\u2019t\nsport, there are no justifiable arguments like \u201cmen are on average bigger\nBest Lead Performer\nor stronger\u201d. This is a creative intelligence thing in which men and women\nare entirely comparable and it you disagree I suggest you go away read \u2018The\nMismeasure of Man\u2019 and rethink your\napproach.\nOne argument against combining\nBest Actor and Best Actress is that\nmen and women on screen can\u2019t get\nthe same jobs unlike anything behind\nthe camera. I have to say I thoroughly\ndisagree for two reasons.\n1. Because there are a lot of things\nthat make people unsuitable for a role-race, size, age are just a few examples.\nIt would be ridiculous to suggest categories like the Best Tall Female Hispanic Leading actor in a 20-30 age\nbracket.\n2. Prosthetics and makeup are currently good enough that this is no\nlonger a consideration. Take for example Todd Haynes surrealist Bob Dylan\nBiopic I\u2019m Not There. It\u2019s shows Bob\nDylan at different stages in his life\nfrom young boy to old man and how\nthey would interact if they met. It has\na stellar cast; Christian Bale, Richard\nGere, Heath Ledger, Ben Wishaw and\nin my opinion the most convincing\nand engaging Bob Dylan (based appearance and mannerisms) is Cate\nBlanchett.\nThere are also many other movies out there in which a woman play\nmen, and more difficultly people on\nboth sides of a transsexual operation\n(Transamerica).\nThe only problem I see with this now\nis that there are many more men in\nmovies, and most leading characters\nare male (Only 1/3 are women). This\nmay push women to the back of the\npack in the awards. However I think\nthat we have to make a decision as to\nwhether we should patronise artists at\nthe cost of giving them more airtime.\nMaybe this is an idea that works better\nin a perfect world where woman are\nequally represented in film, but I think\nwe need to standardise our approach\nand not have a system in place that\nwould have given Kathryn Bigelow a\nBest Female Director award instead of\na Best Director Award.\nPeter Brook\nWriter\n\n"

    "content": "25\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 17 JAN\nFILM\nDirector masterclass: David Lynch\nPeter Brook\nWriter\nLynch is the master of creating unsettling dreamlike visions and the surreal.\nHe has written and directed cult classics such as Eraserhead (1977), Blue\nVelvet (1986) and Mulholland Drive\n(2001). He also directed the more\nmainstream Elephant Man (1980).\nThough the he has been making films\nfor 37 years there has been a set of\naesthetics and themes throughout his\nwork which bind them together to\ncreate a consistent body of work. Critics Le Blanc and Odell stated that \u201chis\nfilms are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions\nand techniques that you could view\nhis entire output as one large jigsaw\npuzzle of ideas.\u201d\nThe main thing that most people\nwill quickly recognise is the dreamlike\nnature of his films. The director Bergman has been described as someone\nwho would \u201crefashion the stuff of his\nunconscious\u201d and due to the oneiric\nquality of his work, Lynch might work\nin a similar way. Of his work, Lynch\nsays:\n\u201cWaking dreams are the ones that\nare important, the ones that come\nwhen I\u2019m quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep,\nyou don\u2019t control your dream. I like to\ndive into a dream world that I\u2019ve made\nor discovered; a world I choose... right\nthere is the power of cinema.\u201d\nAnother recurring motif in his films\nis that of two co-habitanting yet contrasting worlds. Often one of happy,\n1950ies Rockwellian values, American, clean cut, and wholesome goodness with a flip side of a dark, grimy,\nindustrial underworld, neither of\nwhich alone is real. In Mulholland\nDrive Betty Elms is hunting the \u2018Hollywood Dream\u2019 in a swell apartment,\nDiane Selwyn lives in a grotty cabin-like dwelling: dirty and drab. Blue Velvet starts with this Rockwellian wet\ndream of American life and the scene\nmorphs to show creepy unsettling\nworld that lies under this thin fa\u00e7ade.\nAgain we can see something similar\nin The Elephant Man with the Circus\nunderworld and the life of a wealthy\nDoctor.\nThere many other repeated motifs,\nthings like the machine like nature of\nthe world, or showing the world as a\nstage and split characters. There is a\nlot going on, and many of the films\nwarrant second watches; but, if you\nare unfamiliar with Lynch, I suggest\nyou sit down and let these films wash\nover you and I think you\u2019ll find that \u2013\ndispite all the strangeness \u2013 they are\nvery engaging and captivating.\nHis first movie Eraserhead (1977)\nwas meant to be a short 21-minute art\nfilm for the American Film Institute\nbut ended up as a 90-minute feature\nthat became a classic midnight movie.\nWith its droning industrial soundtrack\nand weird imagery, it shows a man living in a sparse derelict city. He goes\nto visit his girlfriend at her parent\u2019s\nhouse where his mother tells him that\nshe has given birth to their child. His\ngirlfriend protests saying that it\u2019s not a\nchild. The plot then sort of takes a hike\nand works it\u2019s way deeper and deeper\ninto a warren of oddities and ideas.\nAfter seeing Eraserhead (Lynch\u2019s\nfirst movie) it would be easy to believe that he is an oddball filmmaker\nwith a cult following. The Elephant\nMan (1980) shows that whilst maintaining all of the oddness and horror\nfrom Eraserhead, Lynch can make a\nmore accessible film. It is the beautiful\ntragedy of one John Merrick (The Elephant Man) a deformed man travelling with a freak show who is taken in\nfrom his cruel showmaster and treated\nlike a human for the first time. However, because of how strange looking\nhe is, it is difficult to get away from being treated like a Victorian oddity and\nsoon becomes the center of a more sophisticated freak-show.\nJohn Merrick played by John Hurt\ngives a knockout performance despite\nthe fact he is wearing very heavy pros-thetics. It would be so easy for a film\nlike this to come across as silly or almost mocking, but you feel so much\nfor John Merrick by the end that I\nfelt my self welling up. Also Anthony\nHopkins deserves to be remembered\nas much for his role as the Doctor\nwho takes Merrick in as he does for\nHannibal Lecter.\nBlue Velvet (1986) starts by toying with the ideas of a crime/mystery\ninvestigated by a high-schooler and\nslowly creeps into a dark underworld\nof voyeurism, obsession in a neo-noir\nstyle. Lynch at his best and almost on\na par with Mulholland Drive.\nLost Highway (1997) in my opinion\nis harder to follow, but as I said before\nLynch is someone you really have to\nimmerse yourself in before you can really enjoy. This is at its core a neo-noir\nthriller which is very engaging.\nWith Mulholland Drive (2001),\nyou\u2019ve never been further into one\ncharacter\u2019s psyche than in this film.\nIt is a bizarre and deeply engaging\ndreamscape, some moments so intimate and then snapping out of them\nand pinging into the same place with\na different perspective. Using film to\nits full potential to explore the dream\nworld of a person, Lynch shows us so\nmuch more of person\u2019s workings than\nanyone has ever done before. This film\nis really a must see for any person with\neven the most remote interest in film.\nThis week we\u2019ve got two cinematic\ngems for any film fans; Alfonso\nCuaron\u2019s interstellar stunner Gravity\nand to celebrate the imminent release\nof the Martin Scorsese\u2019s latest The\nWolf of Wall Street, we\u2019re going old\nschool and bringing back his classic\ncrime epic Goodfellas for one night\nonly.\nThe tale of two astronauts in peril,\nGravity\u2019splotisminimalist(thedetails\nof their ill-fated mission are never\nmade abundantly clear) but it still\nmanages to be all-encompassing in\nscope as it lets its stunning visuals do\nthe talking. One particularly indelible\nshot of Sandra Bullock\u2019s character as\nshe tumbles further and further away\ninto a chasm of darkness, perfectly\ncaptures the insignificance of man in\nthe face of nature. Be prepared for a\nvisceral cinematic experience.\nBased on a true story, Goodfellas\ntells the story of Lucchese crime\nfamily associate Henry Hill\u2019s rise to\ninfamy as he goes from wannabe\ngangster to actual gangster with\nplenty of coke and bitchez along\nthe way. Infused with Scorcese\u2019s\ntrademark black humour, Goodfellas\nportrays the brutal violence and\nmoral depravity of a life of organised\ncrime whilst still managing to be\nthrillingly entertaining.\nGoodfellas: Monday (20/01/14)\n7pm: Tickets: \u00a33 for everyone,\nincluding FREE ICE CREAM/\nPOPCORN\nGravity: Tuesday (21/01/14),\nThursday (23/01/14): both showings\n7pm: \u00a33 Members \u00a34 Non-Members\nSpring Term Line-up\nJanuary 28th and 30th:\nThor: The Dark World/Frozen\nFebruary 4th and 6th:\nThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire\nFebruary 11th and 13th:\nDon Jon/ Anchorman 2: The\nLegend Continues\nFebruary 18th and 20th:\nOldboy\nFebruary 25th and 27th:\nThe Hobbit: The Desolation of\nSmaug\nA new year, a new start: https://\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/\nshop/club-society-project-products/\ncinema-products/2969/cinema-membership-13-14.

Responding to a question\nput to him by the author as part of\nan Imperial College Labour Society\ndelegation that went to meet with Mr\nBalls in December, he explained his\nviews on the government\u2019s new drive\nto reduce immigration to the UK.\nWhen asked what he thought\nof the Union\u2019s campaign, Mr Balls\nresponded by saying that \u2018we\u2019re not\nopposed to migrants contributing to\nthe NHS\u2019 (presumably in the same\nway that UK citizens pay National\nInsurance contributions), but stated\nthat the government\u2019s attitude toward\ninternational students was daft.\n\u2018What we\u2019re seeing is a reduction in\nthe number of students from India\nand Pakistan\u2019, which he agreed was\n\u2018not beneficial\u2019 to the economy. In\nresponse to the author\u2019s questions\nabout what could be done to\nensure that international students\nfrom poorer backgrounds weren\u2019t\ndisadvantaged, Mr Balls agreed to\n\u2018ask Yvette [Cooper]\u2019, the Shadow\nHome Secretary about a potential\namendment to the bill.\nMr Balls\u2019 agreement to do this\ncomes at a critical time \u2013 Labour\nMPs recently abstained from voting\non the second reading of the Bill in\nthe House of Commons in an attempt\nto force the addition of several other\namendments, including one that\ntackles the exploitation of low-paid\nmigrant workers. Should Labour\nend up in a position to pass these\namendments in the final reading of\nthe Bill in the Commons, it will go\nforward to the Lords and if passed\nthere (as seems likely), will come\nback to the Commons for a final\nconsideration of amendments. Once\nthese are approved by the Lords, the\nBill will be signed into law.\nMany have asked why international\nstudents were not excluded from NHS\ncharges under the original wording\nof the Bill \u2013 was it an oversight, or\ndeliberate? Mr Balls had a few ideas\nto share, and seemed to suggest that\nit was the latter: \u2018the majority of illegal\nmigration into this country is from\npeople who are here legally to begin\nwith and who overstay their visas, and\nthe Conservatives aren\u2019t doing very\nwell to manage this\u2019. As a result, he\nsuggests that the Tories are attempting\nto reduce net migration by targeting\nsectors of the population that they can\nmanage \u2013 nominally, international\nstudents and migrant workers, even if\ndoing this is detrimental to the long-term health of the economy.\nOne might expect Mr Balls to be\nsuspicious of the Conservatives\u2019\nmotives, but his suggestion is\nsupported by the statistics. The\ngovernment looks likely to miss its\ntarget of reducing net migration to\nbelow 100,000 people per year (a target\nmany have ridiculed as meaningless),\nand this isn\u2019t the only piece of\nlegislation that has discriminated\nagainst international students in\nrecent years. Caps on the number of\nvisas issued and an increase in tuition\nfees have reduced the number of\napplicants for taught postgraduate\ncourses. Unfortunately the decrease\nhas been most noticeable in students\ncoming from the \u2018poorer\u2019 Asian\ncountries of the Indian Subcontinent,\nwith a 23% drop in the number of\nIndian students and a 20% drop in the\nnumber of Pakistanis.\nThis does really seem unfortunate,\ngiven that the speed at which the\neconomies on the subcontinent are\ngrowing and the potential benefit\nto the British economies that their\nyoung, enthusiastic populations could\nbring. We can only hope that the\nGovernment will see sense and not\nstick another financial hurdle in the\nway of those who want to bring their\ntalent to the UK. If they don\u2019t, I\u2019m sure\nthe onset of damage to our economy\nwill be apparent soon enough - and\nwhat a mess that would be..\nBalls to ask about Amendment to Immigration Bill\nEd Balls reaching out to Ordinary People Ben fernando/FELIX\nW\nith the Create\nLab\u2019s Venture\nC a t a l y s t\nChallenge ads\nplastered all\naround campus, those of us who aren\u2019t\nthat interested in entrepreneurship\nand/or are more academically-oriented might feel a little left out.\nBut while the research model (and\nwizened scientists in general) might\nappear to stick with what works and\nnot necessarily engage with the latest\nand coolest of technology, there\nis actually a surprising amount of\nprogress and innovation beneath the\nsurface.\nThe most important development\nover the past few years is arguably\nthe rise of citizen science. While\nbusinesses and high school students\njump abroad the Internet train to post\nInstagram snaps and tweets in dogged\nbids for attention and popularity,\nscientists globally are taking advantage\nof the hyper-connected nature of\ntoday\u2019s world to create new models\nwhich allow for easier communication\nof scientific ideas, and inspire people\nto take an active role in research\nprojects which may have profound\nresults.\nZooniverse is perhaps the biggest\ncitizen science initiative across\nEurope today. Started by academics\nfrom the University of Oxford and the\nAdler Planetarium, it allows anyone\nanywhere to participate in research\nprojects with nothing more than a\ncomputer and an Internet connection.\nThose of you who are fans of Prof.\nBrian Cox might know Zooniverse\nfrom the BBC\u2019s Stargazing Live show,\nwhich had featured Zooniverse\u2019s\nproject on discovering exoplanets\naround foreign stars. And for those\nof you who frequent London Tube\nstations or are interested in cancer\nresearch, then you may know the\nCancer Research UK-Zooniverse\npartnership which allows the public to\nanalyze cancer patient data en masse.\nIt may seem like such initiatives are\nmerely for those with a lot of time\non their hands (during lectures, for\ninstance?), but they have incredible\npotential to make change. Science\ncommunication, in particular, benefits\nmassively from citizen science\ninitiatives. By letting people get their\nhands dirty and actually be part of\nscience, they can have a personal\nunderstanding of topics that they\u2019re\ninvolved in, and shrink the divide\nbetween scientists-atop-ivory-towers\nand the rest of civilization. The range\nof projects and areas being offered by\nprojects like Zooniverse, which ranges\nfrom physics to zoology and medicine,\nalso allows prospective scientists and\nscience students to explore their\ninterests and inspires them to pursue\nhigher education in those areas. With\nastonishing statistics of educational\nlevels & literacy across London\nboroughs, as shown by the Schools\nPlus programme, even a little push\ncould mean a lot.\nBut if the opportunity of translating\nwhale songs on Zooniverse doesn\u2019t\nsatisfy your appetite for \u2018hard science\u2019\n(what sort of person are you???),\nthen projects like CitizenScienceLab\nand the European Citizen Science\nAssociation might interest you.\nBoth are initiatives with Imperial\ninvolvement, and deal with super-serious science projects like using\ncrowd-sourced efforts to assist in\nparticle physics discoveries and\ndeveloping new organic parts through\nsynthetic biology. A number of their\nprojects are still in infancy, presenting\nplentiful room for you to be involved\nin future science.\nBut citizen science isn\u2019t all about\nscience; for those of you involved\nwith International Development,\nthen UNITAR-UNOSTAT\u2019s \u2018Disaster\nMapping\u2019 is worth a look at. As the\nproject\u2019s profile on CitizenScienceLab\nstates, \u201can expert on the Nubian\npeople of Sudan can look at a\nphotograph of a location experiencing\nfamine and immediately determine\nspecific details such as the clan or sub-clan of people depicted\u2026and perhaps\nminute details such as adequacy of\nfirewood stocks or potential crop\nyields.\u201d By using the Internet to bring\ntogether people who can give input,\ninformation on the regions affected\ncan be quickly collated to help with\nrelief efforts. The Internet suddenly is\nan extremely powerful tool which can\nsave countless lives.\nAs citizen science\u2019s momentum\ncontinues to grow, it\u2019ll be interesting to\nsee whether more of science research\nwill permeate into our daily lives. In\nthe meantime, projects are already up\nand running, so let\u2019s go exploring!\nIf you are interested to find out\nmore about Zooniverse and citizen\nscience in general, and how such\nprojects could engineer social and\neducational change, then be sure to\nattend Imperial Hub\u2019s THE Series:\nCitizen science in future research and\nscience education on Thursday, 23/1.\nThe talk lasts for only 1 hour and is\nFREE.
