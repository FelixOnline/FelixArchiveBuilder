    "content": "2 FELIX LETTERS THE EDITOR\nSir,\nWhile appreciating the strictest need for economy in the refectory, especially to produce ache p.p lunch, Ioan see no reason to include so much\npotato at the expense of other vegetables, when\ncabbage is only 2\u00a3d. per lb. Is this omission an\nadmission of an inability to cook cabbage? If it is due to labour problems, I am sure the lady who\nslams the door in my face the moment I reach the\n\u2022precincts, or the other charming creature, the tic ket whip per, would be only too delighted to do\nsomething useful.\nYours faithfully,\nK.P. Eldridge.\nThe Refectory Committee write :\nMr. Eldridge discourses eloquently of Cabbages\nand Queens. On the first point, one might quote\nJuvenal (VII. 154} who, freely translated,said that\n\"..endless cabbage browned off even the wretched\nfolk in the Upper Dining Hall\"; or, more seriously-plead that we have not yet found out how to make\nboth ends meet on the 1/6 lunch, even without the\ncost of buying and preparing a second vegetable.\nOn the second point, many will recall that to-day's queues would last year have had to wait 20-30\nminutes longer for their lunches: only tight control of the queues makes for to-day's more expeditious\nworking. The taker of tickets referred to was probably the managerial \"queen\" responsible for seeing\nthat all went well.\nJ. F. levy. (Deputy Chairman,Refectory Ctte.)\n26th November, 1950.\nDear FELIX,\nHeartiest congratulations on your first\nanniversary I My dear chap, you have grown out of all recognition - if you wi 11 excuse the avuncular phrase. I remember a time when you were\na little kitten, knee-high to a typewriter,\nand now you're a sleek and well-groomed Cat,\nas black as printers-ink and tremendous institution around I.C.I There is not the least doubt that as l ong as there remains an Imperial College bar,\nour respective Editors shall annually toast\nyour health on the 9th of December, so many\nhappy returns of your birthday, FELIX, and\nhere's power to your elbow.\nBless your fur and whiskers.\nYours, PHOENIX.\n24th November, 1950.\nSir - London is a cold and impersonal city and its character is strongly reflected in its colleges.\nYoung though this university may be, there is a sad\nlack of the tradition and individualism that is so\nmuch a part of others.\nHave we not a professor with personality and\ncharacter enough to institute weekly beer parties\nat the 'Gloucester' or the 'Queen's Arms'? Our\nridiculous licensing hours and the 'nine-to-five'\nstudents would probably reduce these to afternoon\ntea parties at Jane Brown's or Vi's Cosy Cafe, but\nnevertheless occasions when students and teachers\ncould forgather on equal terms in a congenial atmosphere to argue and discuss nothing in particular .\nWhat popularity such a Werner would achieve'.\nBut perhaps South Ken. tea would lack the stimulating effect of Swiss beer and anyway, the board\nof examiners would no doubt deplore the loss of\npractical work. Yours faithfully, Peter Rowe.\n(Chem. Tech.)\nI prof Werner of Zurich became as famous for his\nbeer-garden sessions with students as for his work\nin inorganic chemistry. Indeed it is said that\nhe did hie best work when he had been carried back\nfrom the beer garden to his laboratory'. - Ed.)\n18th November, 1950.\nSir,- Great prominence was given in the last\nissue of FELIX to the de bagging of a student\nwho sells the 'Daily Worker'.\nAs one of those concerned, who has now\nhad his character blackened by your editorial,\nI wish to point out that this was not a rag\ndirected against a political party.\nThere can be no doubt that if member of\nI.C. was foolish enough to offer FELIX for\nsale outside L.S.E. he would be treated with\nbrutal assault. Who then can grumble when\nthe reverse takes place. Yours sincerely,\nD.V. Parker, GUILDS.\nP.S.I suspect that the seller on 17th had\na few kittens when Marcus Hall arrived.\n(Mr. Parker's point was made in our last\nEditorial,-Ed.)\nForeign Correspondence\nThe colourful item of correspondence reproduced below was received by Mr. M.C.

It is gratifying to find that this talent is recognised by\nthe university selectors, and that as a result I.C. is, in general, well represented in the- university\ntear rs. We feel therefore, that our readers may be\ninterested to hear ol I.C.'s coi.tri but ion to university sport and have Included in this issue bri ef accounts from two university clu os. The demand of the university for our best players naturally weakens the college tear.s,, nd match\nsecretaries cannot therefore obtain such good fixtures as would otherwise be possible. This raises\na most controversial point in the field of college\nsport, the pros and cons of which nave been debated\nover many a pint of beer in the bar - to which club\nao es the loyalty of the {layers belong, college or\nuniversity. Many players have three clubs simultaneously demanding tn eir services and the decision\nis a hard one to make.\nA preliminary list of university purples awarded for the. 1949-1950 season was lub li shed in the\nReview issue of l ho enix. Ihose given below have\nbeen awarded since that publication.\nSports Ed.\nSQUASH RACKETS\nThe I.C. Squash Rackets Club has started the\nseason in a very satisfactory manner. Four 1st team matches have been won, including those against\nAshtead and Lensbury, who are among our strongest\nopponents.

Cup competition when they were beaten by Westminster\nat Harlington on Sturday November 11th. The first half of the game was fairly even but\nI.C. could only score once against Westminster's3 Briscoe 3 cored the IC. goal after the opposition\nhad built up a three goal lead, the first of which\nwas put past Williams by an unfortunate I.C. de fen der.\nIn the second period I.C, with Ward limping on\nthe right-wing, were always'fighting a losing battle and, try as they might, could not stop Westminster\nadding three more to their total. On this form Westminster, assisted by Wade,last\nyear'sU.L. captain, should win the Cup; we wish them\nluck.\nThe I.C. team was:- Williams ( capt.); Collins on, Ward; Eastland, Perkins, Last; Jewitt, 'Wheeler, Thompson^.E.), Briscoe, Bowtell.\nIn Division II of the U.L. League I.C.2 nd XI\nhave dropped 3 points out of 4 to L.S.E. and somehow contrived to lose to West Ham T.C. Four victories give the 2nd XI 9 points from 7 games.\nThe 3rd XI lost their first4 Division III games but won the next two scoring 23 goals in the\nprocess.\nOn Saturday, Dec. 9th, I.C. defend the U.L. six a side championship at Motspur Park. With plenty\nof vocal support I.C. might win this tournament for the third year in succession.\nA. A.G. UNIVERSITY S POET U.L. RUGGER\nAfter t wp di sap joint J nt 'voluntary' trials the\nfinal' invitation only' trial provided sci re excel lent Rugby and a potentially strong team was select-ed. After fighting an unbeaten Brighton to a draw\nin the first match the team settled down well and\nthree successive wins, including a53(1 e. to\n1 p.p.) win over St. Vary's Hospital led to the ear ly building up of an excellent team spirit. The loss of the centre triangle from the sci um and the inability of finding a suitable half-back\ncombination has considerably weakened the team and\nthree of the list four games nave been lost. One\nnoteworthy point about these lost games is the fact\nthat even under pressure the University team have\ncontinued to play good attacking Bug by and the score\nhas been incidental to the spirit of the tame.\nOf the team, I.C. have regularly provided five\nplayers - P. Evans (capt.), R. Severn Chon. sec), D. Crossley, B. Pobins, ''. Robinson. Ihe officers of the U.L. R.F.C. are very grateful to the 1.0.

An annual Six-a Side Tournanent is held\n(this year on December 9th.), and also the Uniyersity Association Football Cup competition.\nWith all this happening in til s present season,\nit seems a far cry from two se-so.-s ago, when no less\nthan 7 of the University team cane fro i rI.e., to to day, when I.C.'s sole li r. ii is a non-playing Secretary\nand when I.C. have just lost interest in the Cup for\nthis season. However, the I.C. Soccer Club stills up i ort the U.L. Club as far as they are able and look\nforward to the day when I.C. is again ira position\nto sup j ly University players. It will long be re membered in University circles that it was largely\ndue to I.C. players in the post-war years that the\nUniversity Club is what it is today.\nTo date, the University team has played six games and been beaten only once, last Saturday at Cambridge, by the University, the only goal of the match\nbeing the deciding goal.

    "content": "FELs PROFILE PIONEER EDITOR\nAs is amply told on another page it is just\ntwelve months since FELIX was born - twelve months in which our college has been very much in the\npublic eye: spectacularly in the West London Police\nCourt and on the Serpentine, quietly and more significantly in the Parliamentary debates on the concept\nof a Technical University.\nIn this last year of the perpetual struggle to\nprevent the college from degenerating into a forcing\nnous* of technical knowledge, individuals rather than\norganisations have both led the way and carried most\nof the burdens, amongst whom E.M. Hughes, first editor of FELIX is a notable example.\nIt was because he felt so strongly that much of\nthe apathy at I.C. was due to ignorance of what went\non that Ted consented to become a veterinary ob st ret ici an, wet-nurse and guiding hand when FELIX was\nfirst conceived.\nTed Hughes was bo en in Croydon in1923, the son\nof an eminent dental surgeon. When he left school\nat Saffron Waldron (Higher School Certificate with\none mark to spare), he put in a year in an engineering shop. He then went to Northampton Engineering\nCollege when he failed Part I( this time by an unspecified margin).\nAfter his training in Canada he was com misi one d in the E.A.F. as a pilot, sunbathed his way through\n0. T.U. in the Bahamas and then flew Liberators based\non Ceylon and the Cocos Islands.\nThe Utopian society of these islands in which\nthe worst disease is asthma and the only 'crime' the\nanticipation of marriage, made a lasting impression\non him and did much to restore a faltering faith in humanity. It is interesting to note that while enjoying London life more than most, he feels that only\nsuch a communal appr aach as the setting up of a residential university of South Kensington, with at least two liberal arts faculties brought in, can provide that intellectual clash between different types\nof mind, so essential to university society.\nHis college life is very much in keeping with\nhis reserved, polished, competent and somewhat persuasive manner. For the first two years he worked\n\"because I felt I ought to\". In his third year he\ncalmly picked up the heaviest, and trickiest job -the editorship of FELIX - carried it overwhelmingly\nto success and collected a first in Mechanical Engineering on the way. Without, we dare aver, disturbing one lock of the perfectly parted hair or neglecting once to polish his glistening shoes.\nWith his prot eg4 well established Ted has reluctantly become Editor-elect of PHOENIX but despite\nthis association with fine jea the rs and ancient lineage he is still Advisory Editor of the nosier and\nwe hope more agile FELIX.\nTed is now engaged on research in gas dynamics.\nHe is Secretary of the Links club, plays squash for\n1. C., and has already shown himself an administrator\nof standing and a man with the good of the college\nvery much in his mind. For the future we may be\nsure that Ted Hughes will continue to edit and engineer with equal facility. EVENTS\nGARDEN NOTES\nby Umfaam.\nAttention in the garden, at this time of the\nyear of wet muggy nights, should be directed towards those flowers which overcrowd and wither in\nthe shelter of every wall. The less pleasing\nflowers, should be immediately uprooted and cast\nout, for they muscle out the sweet and beautiful\nvar i ties, all of which require constant care and\nencouragement.\nIn arid places progress is much accelerated\nby the early and frequent applications of a solution Ginn an Lime, which should be allowed to soak\nright in. At this stage it is often expedient to\ntransplant the flowers to less crowded j arts of the\ngarden, where there is plenty of shade\nIf the above precautions are observed, while\nkeeping the plants warm at nights, and well protected from o hills, these flora should be at the\nheight of fragrant loveliness for Christmas.\nAlthough large scale experiments carried out\nin America on the upturning of Clods and subsequent\nspraying with D.D.T. were most effective, the more\nefficient method is the removal of each weed, in div ideally, by hand; even if this may be more back-breaking.\nI commend to you all a supreme effort to set\nour hop-garden in order before it becomes too in-feste d. \u2014 .\nAPOLOGY PENDING?\n\"Matrons we have always found difficult, but Shirley\nMeek has never disappointed us yet\".\n(From the review of 'Mandraagola' in Phoenix Review\n1949-50).\nFRIDAY, DECEMBER l st. \"Ends and Means1\n,' lecture by Prof. V.C.

    "content": "FELIX4 FELIX ROAD TEST-NO. 3\nTHE BICYCLE MOTORS With so many students living some miles away\nfrom College, these inexpensive little motors have\nbecome of great personal interest to many of us.\nThey are quickly and easily fitted to any type of\nbicycle, are outstandingly eo on om ical, and their\nmano eu vr ability enables them to ne goo i ate London\ntraffic at least as quickly as other motor vehicles\nWe are therefore giving a serious description\nof the three most popular types on the market, and\nimpressions of the machines based on the experience\nof owners in the College.\nMINI-MOTOR\nThis is undoubtedly the fastest and most powerful of the three. It is a two-stroke engine of\n49 o.c. developing 1-3 H.P., that drives the rear\nwheel through a deeply milled roller. It is simply fitted to any bicycle without any modification\nbeyond the removal of a section of mud-guard, and\nis raised or lowered into contact with the wheel\nby means of a lever on the handlebars. This system has the merit of simplicity, but it is inclined to sling mud and is fairly heavy on tyres - e tandem type tyre lasts about 1500 miles. A possible criticism is that its top speed of 30 m.p.h. is too high to be safe on most bicycles, but the\ndiscomfort of driving an un sprung machine at this\nspeed would keep most people down to a more moderate 20-25, and only use full power on hills. The fuel consumption is about 200 m.p.g., and the price \u00a321 inclusive.\nCYMOTOR\nThis is another friction drive motor, via a carbo run dum roller to the front wheel. It is\nthe cheapest of the three under review, and incorporates a powerful lighting system driven by\nthe magneto-generator. Although of nearly the\nsame capacity asthe Mini-Motor, 45 cc, it is noticeably less powerful, giving a maximum speed of\n20 m.p.h. and an acc le ration poor by comparison.\nIt is understood that a modified engine is to be\nproduced, with redesigned cylinder ports to give\ngreater power. The two owners of these motors\nin the College also complain of poor starting.\nIt is open to the same criticism of mudslinging\nand tyre wear as the Mini-Motor, a tyre lasting\nabout 1500 miles but costing only 13/2d. The\nmakers claim 250 m.p.g., but our owners find\nthey get about 180 m.p.g. in London. Price 18\ngn s. inclusive.\nCYCLEMASTER\nThis is certainly the neatest power unit,\nthe whole contraption including engine, fuel\ntank and drive being housed in the rear hub.\nThe whole rear wheel is sold com let e and no\nmodification to the bicycle is necessary. It\nis a much smaller engine than the previous two,\nbeing only 25 cc, but it gives a quite remarkable amount of power, giving a top speed of 23\nm.p.h. and sufficient use for most London hills. It has a real clutch that can be used as such,\nalthough it appreciates a little pedal assistance in starting from rest, and will accelerate\nsmoothly (albeit gently) from a walking pace on\nthe throttle alone. There is not space here for\ntechnical details, but it is a remarkably ingenious and efficient piece of engineering. Fuel\nconsumption is 260-300 m.p.g., and the price \u00a325\ninclusive.\nKEMPSON' S Sf VSHOE REPAIR SERVICE : t= fc'44, Queen's Gate Mews,\nQueen's Gate,\nKensington, S.W.7 SPLITTING THE INFINITIVE\nOneof the most closely guarded secrets of the\nera can now be told, how an anonymous group of gram-marian s, working in secrecy in a remote sect ian of\nthe country, have finally succeeded in splitting the\ninfinitive.\nThe so-called \"Bronz Project\" got under way in\n19*3 with the installation of huge Infinitron spec-i ally constructed for the job by Caltech philologists.\nThough the exact details are still withheld for\nreasons of security, it is possible to de sri be the\ngeneral process.\nFrom a stockpile of fission able gerunds, encased\nin leaden clich es to prevent radio-activity, a suitable subject is withdrawn and placed in the in fin it ron together with a small amount. of syntax. All this\nmaterial must be handled with great care as the slightest slip may lead to a painful solecism.\nOnce inside the apparatus, the gerund is whirled about at great speed, meanwhile being bombarded\nwith small part icp les. A man with Gender Counter\nstands always ready to warn others if the Alpha-Betical rays are released in such high quantities as to\nrender the scientists neuter.\nThe effect of the bombardment is to dissociate\nthe whirling parts of speech from one another until\nat length an infinitive splits off from its gerund\nand is ejected from the machine. It is picked up\ngingerly with a pair of hanging clauses and plunged\ninto a bath of ple on as m. When it cools, it is ready for use.\nThe question is often asked: Can other countries likewise split the infinitive? I think we\ncan safely answer \"No\".\nThough it is true that Russia, for one, is known to have large supplies of the s a urus hidden away\nbehind the Plural Mountains, it is doubtful if the\nRussians possess the scientific technique. They\nhave the infinitive but not the know-how.\n(Originally published in \"Tennessee Valley Engineer\")\nI. C.W. A. DANCE\nFriday evening the 17th November was a notable\nevening at the Union. The ladies of I. C.W. A. were demonstrating their capabilities as\norganisers and their charm as hostesses on the\noccasion of the I. C.W. A. dance. This dance,well\nknown as one of the leading social events of the\nI.C. year, proved to be quite as good as its many\npredecessors and was very well attended. The\n\u2022Vice-President of I. C.W. A., Br. Pratt, with her\nusual good-natured enthusiasm, set the pace for\na really enjoyable evening. Two past VicePresidents, Miss Sherwood and Lady Hill were\nalso present. It seems extremely unlikely that\nJI. C.W. A. will ever spoil their reputation for\nf being able to put on a \"good show\" at their\ndances. Many thanks to t la em from all who\nattended.\n\n"

At 1.30 a ceremonial march scoured the various college departments\nfor brown bag gers. Then, with a rendering of the\nnew RCS war-cry 'Kangella' in the RCS Hall, the\nprocession, headed by the Drum, the 'band' and\nsome banners (\"Equal Rights for Men',etc) moved off\nto South Ken., scoring off a motor-cyclist on it's way and rendering 'Lloyd George knew my father' to\na bewildered public. Pennies on the Drum supplied\nfunds for a party ticket for 90 (there were 120 of\nthem).\nAt Putney Bridge the leaders were dismayed to\nsee the ticket collector counting the number so\n'Every man for himself was the order.

GUILDS WIN LOWRY CUP A GRIZZLY SKY WATCHED THE ROYAL SCHOOL\nOF MINES WIN THE 1950 RACE FOR THE\nMORPHY CUP ON WEDNESDAY NOV. 22nd. THIS WAS AFTER THE RACE HAD BEEN STOPPED HALF WAY DUE TO A COLLISION BETWEEN GUILDS AND R.C.S. RESULTING IN A BROKEN OAR. WHEN THIS HAPPENED THE\nMINES WERE LEADING BY ABOUT 1 LENGTH\nFROM GUILDS WHO LED RCS BY A CANVAS.\nTHE OAR REPLACED, THE 'RACE' WAS RESTARTED IN THESE POSITIONS AND THE\nFINAL PLACING SAW MINES THE UNDOUBTED VICTORS BY If LENGTHS, WITH GUILDS\nSECOND ABOUT J LENGTH UP ON RCS.\nTHE LOWRY CUP WAS WON BY GUILDS,\nWITH RCS AND MINES DEAD-HEATED.\nBy our Rowing Correspondent.\nThe Morphy Cup of 1950 will be remembered for\ntwo things. Firstly, for an extremely good Mines\ncrew who always looked thoroughly comfortable and\nrowed in a very businesslike manner. Secondly, for\nbad co xing on the part of the Guilds cox, which not\nonly impeded his own boat but the RCS as well.\nThere was a fast ebbing tide and a cross following\nwind when the three crews turned to drift down to\nthe start. All three crews made good starts, striking blade for blade, at 37. Guilds took the\nlead at once being a canvas up on the RCS and nearly half a length on the Mines at the end of half a minute. The Mines by now were getting well into\ntheir stride and at Harrods the three crews were\nlevel. It was at this point that erratic steering\non the part of the Guilds kept themselves and the\nRCS much too close to the Surrey shore. The Mines\ntaking full advantage of this were steered into the\nfastest part of the tide and rowing very comfortably\nat 33 proceeded to draw ahead. At the Crab Tree\nthe Mines were half a length up and by the Mile Post\nhad increased this to a length. Soon after the Mile\nPost as they were approaching the bend the RCS clashed with Guilds, a thing they might well ha-/e done\nmuch earlier. The crews were brought back and restarted just below the Mile Post iri their relative\npositions at the time of the clash. In the row in,\nthough it looked possible at one time that the RCS\nmight just beat the Guilds for second place, the\nlead of the Mines remained unchallenged, and they\nwon by 1% lengths from the Guilds, with the RCS a further # length behind. A word of praise must be\ngiven to the Guilds crew for the very fine fighting\nspirit they showed. The Mines time of 3 min 15 sees\nfor the Mile Post showed that they would have done a fast time if the race had not been interrupted.\nThe Lowry Cup was won by the Guilds in the fast\ntime of 4 min 20 sees. This result was not un ex pec. ted, but due to spirited competition from the other\ntwo crews they were unable to establish a lead till the end of the wall. They were obviously the more\npolished crew as their 2)C lengths victory showed.\nThere was a fine fight which deservedly ended in a dead-heat between the Mines and the RCS for second\nplace. If the same fighting spirit is to characterise the IC crews this year, then we can hope for\ngreat things.\nCHRISTMAS!

    "content": "FELIX 3\nEDITORIAL\nORIGIN OF A SPECIES\nOn Dec. 9th last year, FELIX was horn; many\nhave since wondered how this momentous event came\nabout.\nThe conception of an Imperial College newspaper\nhas for a long time been a twinkle in the Onion's eye, but the only previous attempts were The Muckrake,\nwhich raked so thoroughly that it was quickly stopped,\nand a weekly Phoenix which died in1930 in mortal combat with the Hector and the Board of Governors.\nThe matter was again raised at a meeting of the\nPhoenix Board of Directors last year, and the idea so\nappealed to Derek Howe that he undertook to inquire\ninto its feasibility. The first thing he did was to\nbuy copious quantities of beer for an unemployed fri end, Ted Hughes, and talk him into accepting the ed-it or ship, Ted being so overcome by the hitherto unprecedented spectacle of Derek \" in the chair\" that he\naccepted. The promise of help was obtained from a few other stalwarts, and the still unofficial FELIX\nBoard held its first meeting.\nAfter some cajoling the Union Executive Committee agreed to back the venture to the limit of \u00a35,this\nfigure being more an indication of Derek Howe's eloquence than of the innate generosity of Council. It\nis perhaps of interest to note that Q. M.C's paper,\nThe Cub, is sub sidi sed by their Union up to \u00a3125 a year. The new FELIX Board therefore decided that\nthe paper should be launched in a form that would\nensure that it payed its way, and Miss Larcom agreed\nto type and Roneo it at an economical price.\nIt now remained only to find a name, and something to put into the paper. The former problem was\nsolved for us by F.C. Ewels, and we are still congratulating ourselves on our fortunate choice; the\nlatter is a constant source of worry to the Editor,\nbut usually seems to turn up in the end. 600 copies\nof the first issue were produced and sold at a remarkable speed; thereafter 1000 copies were sold each\nfortnight.\nThe end of the year found the paper established\nas part of the College, and recognized and constituted by Council as the official newspaper of I.C. The\ntime had come to find a new method of printing to\ngive us more scope, and yet remain economical - a decision which was in any case forced on us by the\nincrease in the price of paper. The success of the\nnew format may be seen in the circulation figures,\nwhich has already gone up to 1250, whilst still al lowing us to clear a few shillings on each issue.\nWe feel that the most flattering reflection on\nour present position was the recent suggestion that\nan effigy of FELIX be obtained as College mascot.\nPOOR COXING\nThe collision between two of the boats during\nthe iV.orph y Cup race has reduced it to a near-fiasco\nfor the second year in succession. There is little doubt that the Mines thoroughly deserved their vic-tory; but the placing of Guilds and R.C.S. had\nthere been no collision - has been hotly debated in\nrowing circles. Thequestion of blame for the occ-u rence need not concern us here: that is for the Umpire to decide. The point is that a race is no\nlonger worth the name once it has been stopped and\nrestarted.\nThe cox es in a race carry a very heavy responsibility, and must concern themselves not only with\nurging on their crews but also with exemplary steer-ing; in addition, they must remain always alert to\nthe Umpire's megaphone.\nMorphy CupLowry Cup\nSenior Sculls\nJunior Sculls\nNovice Sculls\nBOAT CLUB DINNER\nThis year's Boat Club Dinner surpassed all others\nin the length of the speeches; as a result it ended\nperilously near to closing time and but for the prompt action of Derek Coomber in asking for a bar ex ten sion, there would have been no opportunity for members to get 'one for the road1. After proposing the toast of the King>, the Capttain, D.W. North, asked Mr. Morphy to present the\ntrophies and tankards:-Royal School of Mines.\nCity and Guilds College.\nTizard Challenge Cup) - CH-Barwise.\nWebber Challenge Cup) - D. Benfield.\nLindsav Memorial CUD) G.W. Benson '\nPair Oars(Wynne-Finch Cup) CHBarwise & SJPeerless\nThe toast of the club was proposed by the coach\nCharles Bristow, who outlined the history of the club\nfrom the early day after the first World War, stressing to the fresher s that the fine equipment now in use was due to the sacrifices made by members in the\nearly days. Charles welcomed to the dinner K.C. Wilson (first captain of I. C.B.C.) and Mr. Morphy as\nbeing men who gave much useful encouragement in the\nearly 1920's. Commenting on the day's racing, Charles said that the standard of the rowing was <|xtreme ly high and augured well for the future; he was confident\nthat under the leadership of 'Micky' North the club\ncould look forward toa successful year.\nIn replying, the Captain said that he too looked\nforward toa successful year under the trustworthy\ncoaching of Charles. In his speech he mentioned and\nquoted from a recent letter to the Editor of FELIX,\nin which the view was put forward that a college is judged on its academic achievements and hence \"brown-bagging\" is justifiable. 'Micky' refuted this suggestion and quoted Sir Henry Tizard, sometime Rector\nof I.C., who said that the achieve m nts of the '46\nHenley crew had spread the name of the college quite\nas much as any academic distinctions.\nIn proposing the toast of Thames R.C., David\nNowell, Vice-Captain, emphasized the close association between I.C. and Thames, typified by the corridor between the boat houses known as \"Charles' cut\".\nThe reply by the H. Rushmere, Captain of Thames, was\nlively and witty; he summed up our relationship in\nthe words: \"\nWe supply the beer and you a constant\nstream of beer-sodden oars men.\"\nThe toast of the guests was proposed by Brian\nThwaites and replied to by Derek Coomber in the most\nappreciated of the evening, which consisted of three\nvery good jokes, and a promise of a bar extension\ntill eleven. This completed, the beer-sodden oarsmen retired to the bar to enjoy their extra half-L.I. F.C.U. THE MISSION IN RETROSPECT\nDuring its two weeks' run, ending ten days ago, the\nMission in the London University as applied to Imperial College, showed that God said much in the past\nthat is specially applicable to the present time.\nThe meetings were well attended and aroused considerable interest, and if one of the aims of the Mission was to provide an opportunity of hearing the\nChristian Faith expounded in a clear and practical\nway, it was certainly achieved. The resident Missioner, Mr. Metcalfe Collier,\nnow a familiar figure in the Hostel, proved himself\nboth an able speaker and a helpful friend to many.\nIt was surprising to find how many lacked an understanding of the logic and truth to be found in Christianity, though many of the basic facts were known.\nA further series of meetings is therefore being arranged for next term. Competnet speakers are being\nasked to talk on subjects such as:-\"The reliability\nof the New Testament Documents\"; \"The Church\";\"How\nto approach the Christian Faith\", and others. Details will be announced later.\nHowever, the work of the Mission will never be\nfinished as there is always more to be gained in knowledge and practice of the Christian Faith.\nP.M.
