ITV\u2019s Downton Abbey,\nthe most popular period-piece for years, has\ncome under fire lately for using around 8 years\nof obsequity in as many episodes. Writer Julian\nFellowes told FELIX! that he plans to eventually turn Downton Abbey into a documentary\nabout a National Trust property in Berkshire,\nand therefore plans to carry on extracting a\ngreat number of pound coins for some time\nto come. High-brow television owners have\nvoiced their opinion that the post-war decades don\u2019t have the same appeal to them unless they feature Philip Glenister as retro\ncop Gene Hunt next to that bird with the\nnice legs, and therefore it would be better for everyone if the BBC just remade\neverything in high definition \u2013 \u201cThat\nway, by the time they\u2019ve finished\nthere\u2019ll be a few more decades that\nare quite long ago, and Apple\u2019s Retina TV to remake the rest for\u201d.\nThere was general sadness this week when\na previous guest on the Jeremy Kyle Show\nwas refused the right to sue his attacker under\nthe so-called \u201cbargepole law\u201d.\nAttacker Baron Kenwin Faunterloy of that\nfancy manor over the road continues to maintain his innocence in the case, citing his attack\non Kevin Humperdinck as \u201cself-defense\u201d under\nthe controversial law.\n\u201cTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t as though I was walking the streets looking for an easy target to\nbeat with my diamond encrusted cane... oh go\non then, it was!\u201d\nThe standard measure for this \u201csafe distance\nof defense\u201d \u2013 a \u201cbargepole\u2019s length\u201d \u2013 was\nmade law in 1706 to pre-empt the Treaty\nof Union between England and Scotland by\ngiving the English an easy means to keep the\nBraveheart wannabes at bay.\nAlthough now considered rare, bargepoles\ncan still be found in places where barges exist.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it if poor people walk past me,\u201d\nFaunterloy continued, \u201cit\u2019s just beating down\non the poor has been in my line for hundreds\nof generations!\u201d\nThose who decried the story as a sad indictment of the current class system were swiftly\nshot down in the Commons, where a debate\nwas held and nothing was really decided, like\nusual.\nSHERLOCK ACTOR CHANGES NAME\nAFTER SAUSAGE CONFUSION\nSerial Sherlock Holmes impersonator Benedict\nCumberbatch has had his name altered by\ndeed poll this week, follwing an embarrassing\nincident in a butcher\u2019s shop in North Yorkshire.\nTV nearing natural limit\nof period-drama making\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012\n24\n\u201cI can\u2019t help\nit if poor\npeople walk\npast me\u201d\nAmerican \u201cpregnant\u201d\nby 3D skin flick\nAn American woman has sued filmmakers\nafter claiming that watching a three-di-mentional shoddy film resulted in her becoming\npregnant.

In hew new film Diamonds\nare a Queen\u2019s Best Friend, Mirren reprises her\nrole as the Queen, celebrating her Diamond Jubilee, marking 60 years on the throne. Her spot-on portrayal of the Queen\u2019s famous royal waves\ncaptured the hearts of audiences worldwide,\nwith critics praising her hand gestures as being\n\u201csimply sublime,\u201d \u201castonishing,\u201d \u201cmesmerising\u201d and \u201cheart-wrenchingly beautiful.\u201d The\nBSSH, British Society for Surgery of the Hand,\nwere also enthusiastic about Mirren.\nOne surgeon commented, \u201cher fingers move\nabout so gracefully, there\u2019s something so majestic about the way she waves. The proportions are absolutely right.\u201d\nThe film, essentially a two-hour footage of\nMirren waving on a boat rowed single-handed-ly as punishment by the guy who interrupted\nthis year\u2019s Oxford-Cambridge race, is already\ntipped to win this year\u2019s Best Actress Oscar.\nThe Dark Knight Rises will serve as the backbone\nto an upcoming pornographic film. Still set in\nGotham, The Dark InCognito Knight Rises looks\nat the slow but sure and steady \u201crise\u201d of a\nman, despite all the restrictions he faces,\nmost notably from the incredibly tight\nleather suit he needs to wear for some\nof his clients. Former stripper Channing\nTatum has shown keen interest in star-ring, with Disney star Selena Gomez,\nlooking to be taken more seriously as a\ngrown-up actress, is in negotiations to star as\nCatwoman.\nThis new ambitious project will be financed by\nthe BCP (Berlus Coni Productions) responsible for\nmany classic hits such as Sex Toy Story 2 and\nPump Fiction.\nMIRREN OSCAR?\nIMPERIAL FILM\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012 17\nThe new teaser trailer for Tom Hooper\u2019s film adaptation of West End musical Les Miserables\nhas fans eager for this year\u2019s Christmas\nwhen the film hits the screens. Adding\nfurther context to his latest, the Academy Award winning director of The King\u2019s\nSpeech hinted that his new musical film\nwill be a \u201cmore hard-hitting, raw, emotional rollercoaster ride.\u201d\n\u201cThedifficultywas,\u201dhecontinued\u201cthe\ntrailer is supposed to be suitable for\neveryone. So we decided not to show\nthe full scale and depth we jumped\ninto. For instance, we couldn\u2019t show\nthe extent of Anne Hathaway\u2019s hair\nloss.\u201d When further quizzed on this\nmatter, he replied \u201clet\u2019s just say it\u2019s\nnot just the head that gets shaved.\nLook, Fantine [the character Hathaway plays] needs money in the sto-ry. We assumed she\u2019d want to sell\nit all. Everything she has. The whole\nnine yards.\u201d\nHathaway, who sings \u2018I Dreamed a\nDream\u2019 in the trailer, was praised for\nher distraught look in the trailer. And\nthis certainly better explains just why\nshe was so convincing in her bare per-formance. Les Miserables is out later\nthis year, and has been rated 18 for\nstrong sexual content, the first time\never for a West End musical adapta-tion.\n\n"

Have the people you\nlisten to and get influenced by changed\nmuch over the last few years?\nN: Being a music fan and a musician are\ntwo completely disparate things for me.\nI listen to music avidly but never from a\nstandpoint of \u201cthis is what I want to sound\nlike\u201d. You need to trust what\u2019s inside of\nyou and let that come out organically,\nnever let other\u2019s experiences and creativity\ninform your own.\nW: What have been your favorite tours\nthat you\u2019ve done so far? Any bands you\u2019ve\nparticularly enjoyed playing with?\n\u201cMy most recent tour of\nScandinavia and Eastern Europe was blissful.\nThey had to pretty much\npry me from Finland\u201d\nbeen in the news lately. What are you\nthoughts about the illegal downloading of music and how do you feel it has\nchanged the industry? Do you think it\ncan it ever been seen as a good thing?\nN: I think it\u2019s a shame for the industry, all\nthose white men in suits, but I also think\nit\u2019s inevitable. People are sneaky, they always have been! The Internet is the wild\nwest, and even I can\u2019t deny the charm of\nthat. So I try not to be too judgmental. It\njust forces you to work harder. And when\npeople do choose to support something,\nthey fully commit. I meet many people\nat my shows who come up to me with my\nentire discography, down to the limited\nedition seven inches of only 100 copies.\nPeople that truly believe in what you are\ndoing will continue to support you no matter what.\nW: How did you get your stage name?\nN: I made it up when I was young, without a purpose for it until I started making\nmusic.\nZola Jesus plays along with other huge acts\nsuch as Bon Iver, Elbow, Paul Weller and\nmany more at Latitude Festival, Henham\nPark, Suffolk (12-15 July).

By \u2018this\u2019 I mean haha im sorry,\nKitty Pryde\u2019s debut mixtape. Words truly fail me\n\u2013 ok, well maybe not entirely, but let\u2019s not get\nmeta here. Let\u2019s imagine, for a horrifying mo-ment, that you teamed a tumblr tween up with\nthe guys behind Main Attrakionz. You\u2019d end up\nwith lazy, hazy hip-hop beats (the type that define Clams Casino, A$AP Rocky, and, of course,\nMain Attrakionz) and a tumblr tween making you\nfacepalm about our future with her inane rap...\nWhich would all be fine, we could just direct\nanonymous vicious Internet hate in her general\ndirection and get on with our lives. But her music\ndemands repeat listens. Her lyrical content says\nsomething eye-opening about the priorities of Internet-reared youngsters \u2013 Kitty Pryde is a inno-cent, bottom-lip-tattooed, cry for attention from\nkids who can afford Supreme but can\u2019t afford to\nlet their guard down for one second.\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, the collaboration between\nthe newest wave of hip-hop and white America\u2019s\nteen culture simply reflects the absolute ascendancy of hip-hop culture in the Western world \u2013 a\nprogression which can be seen to begin as far\nback as Public Enemy\u2019s sell-out tour of the UK\nin the late 80s.\nI\u2019d go as far as to say that Kitty Pryde is one\nof the most self-aware artists to appear since\nthe Millenium \u2013 her remix of Carly-Rae Jepsen\u2019s\n\u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019 is clearly a conscious recognition that some detractors will try to tar with the\n\u201ccheap pop\u201d brush. Ignore the haters, Kitty, keep\nrolling.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with this column, feel free to\nGoogle \u201ctrolling\u201d. Alternatively, tweet me @kadhim-shubber with complex comparisons between Kitty\nPryde and Aung Suu Kyi. If you\u2019re struggling with\nthat comparison, tweet @kttydothedishes and ask\nher to Google Aung Suu Kyi for you... Either way,\nthis is my last column ever. It\u2019s been fun. Thank\nyou for indulging me, and letting me pretend I\nknow anything about music...\nKitty Pryde\nhaha im sorry\n2012\nIMPERIAL MUSIC\n\n"

    "content": "EXCLUSIVE: EVERYTHING CAUSES CANCER\nAresearch paper obtained by FELIX!\nScience in advance of publication\nin an academic journal proves that going about your daily life increases your\nchances of getting cancer. The research,\nled by Professor Liam Yliad in the Department of Medicine, Imperial College\nLondon, shows that being alive is the single biggest risk factor for cancer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing,\u201d said Professor Yliad.\n\u201cI was looking through the data, and\ntime and time again I saw it. Every single patient in our sample that had been\ndiagnosed with cancer had been alive\nat the time of their diagnosis \u2013 some for\nmany years.\u201d\nThe news will come as a blow to sci-IMPERIAL SCIENCE\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012\n6\nMICKEY ON MERCURY\nCraters that bear an uncanny resemblence to Mickey Mouse were spotted on\nthe planet Mercury by NASA\u2019s Messenger probe, the first spacecraft to visit the\nplanet. The photo shows an area close to the Magritte crater where daytime\ntemperatures soar to a frazzling 400\u00b0C and dip as low as -200\u00b0C at night.\nEU FIRES BILLIONS INTO SPACE\nWhile working class people across Europe struggle against harsh austerity measures, European\nbureaucrats have handed a billion euros to academics at elitist institutions such as Oxford to\ngo on a jolly to Jupiter. While youth unemployment is over 50% in Greece and Spain, European\ngovernments have shown themselves to be as\ndown-to-earth as ever by sending money into\nspace rather than addressing problems faced by\ntheir own people.\nLICENSE TO SPILL\nThe latest weapon in the arsenal of ineffectual\ntools for cleaning up oil spills in fragile marine\necosystems comes from nanotechnology. Scientists in the US say that once once an oil spill oc-curs, polluters can deploy a new wonder sponge\nthat will quickly mop up any oily mess. With\ntheir new carbon nanosponge, oil can be soaked\nup, squeezed out, stored or simply burnt off,\nalmost anything in fact, other than bring back to\nlife the plant and animal species that soaked up\nthe oil in the first place.\nentists who thought that instead of causing cancer, everything might in fact prevent cancer. The debate between these\ntwo academic factions has been ongoing for some years. Experts say that this\nresearch paper will put an end to that,\nand will allow scientists to concentrate on\nfinding a cure.\nThe challenge now for scientists is to\nwork out how this research can be applied to cure cancer once and for all.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown that being alive is the ultimate cause of cancer,\u201d says Professor\nYliad. \u201cSo now, the hunt is on to find a\npreventative measure that could reduce\nthat risk factor for people who have yet\nto show signs of cancer development.\u201d\nBE BETTER WITH BEER\nSeveral reports have shown that moderate drinking\nof wine can have health benefits due to the antioxidants available within. Recently, researchers from\nthe British Esteemed Ethanol Recommendation Society\n(BEERS) established that these health benefits extend\nto beer.\nTheir study showed that the welcoming atmosphere\nof a pub added to the health benefits, citing a 40%\ndecrease in antisocial behaviour. On why these results\nhave only just surfaced, Dr Hofstadter told FELIX!: \u201cwell\nit always takes longer than you expect\u201d. Moderate beer\nconsumption can reduce the risk of stomach ulcers and\ncontrary to reports from the Daily Mail, can lower risk\nof cancer by protecting against Helicobacter pylori.\nUCL have confirmed that there is no link between the\namount of beer consumed and obesity, eliminating the\nbeer belly myth. Since beer is rich in silicon, studies have\nshown that not only does it help strengthen bones, but\nit also protects against osteoporosis. A study of 5,000\nBritons showed that more than one pint of beer a day\nreduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Polyphenols, found in beer, cut levels of cholesterol and are\nalso effective in combating breast cancer. The scientists\nalso found that a bottle a day cut risks of kidney stones\nby 40% due to the diuretics found within. Beer constitutes over 20% of the daily recommended fibre intake,\nserving as one of your five-a-day. Though the benefits\nof antioxidants in darker ales have shown a reduction in\nthe risk of cataracts, they warn that excessive consumption has seemingly led to short term visual and mental\nimpairment and should be avoided.\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander \u201c24 Kara Gold\u201d Karapetian\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "LOVE WORDS\nAnastasia Eleftheriou and Michael Krestas,\nthe current Food Editors of Felix, have gone\nmissing. Matt Colvin, the paper\u2019s Editorin-Chief, declared that they haven\u2019t been\nanswering to his numerous emails over the\npast 10 days. Their friends at Imperial say\nthat both of them were very frustrated with\ntheir respective work loads; Anastasia was\nworking very hard to meet her individual\ndeadline and Michael was trying to find time\nto fit in his internship that started before\nthe end of the term. Policemen who visited\nthe Editors\u2019 houses did not find any clue that\ncould lead them to a conclusion. FELIX! has\nnot made a formal announcement about\nthe matter, but inner circles admit that the\npaper cannot wait for them forever. Sooner\nor later, the position of the Food Editor will\nbe declared as \u201cempty\u201d and whoever wants\nmay apply. A Food Editor\u2019s duties include receiving several invitations for free dinners at\nrestaurants and cocktail bars and free samples from various companies. J.B.\nOk let\u2019s face it. Being a Food Editor is cool! Free\nsamples, free dinners, the prestige of being a\nfood critique and blah blah blah. At the beginning I\nthought that this would attract guys, as I na\u00efvely believed that everybody would fancy going out with a\ngirl and enjoy very good service for absolutely free!\nAnd here comes Michael. The reason that nothing of\nthe above happened. We had to go together for every review (so I didn\u2019t have the chance to invite any-body...), and also guys were sceptical to ask me out as\nthey weren\u2019t sure if we are together! A.E.\nCO-EDITOR UNVEILED\nBeing an editor is a great thing. Being a co-editor is a true torture. If\nyou have never worked with Anastasia before I suggest you never\ndo so! She can be incredibly distracting, lacking any sense of time and\nconcentration. Editing a one-page section typically requires a couple of\nhours but with Anastasia you may want to take off the entire day for it.\nThe worse thing is that she thinks she\u2019s pleasant and fun to work with. It has\nbeen hard admiting those things about my colleague, but I feel the obligation to inform future editors and co-workers. When you see Anastasia\nagain, simply turn the other way. M.K.\nFOOD EDITORS MISSING\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012\n28\nThese are the places I could have gone with anyone but instead I was stuck with Michael\nS.G. and N.N., who came second in the Imperial Food\nAwards last autumn, have recently filed a formal complaint\nagainst the Union describing the awards as \u201cthe epitome of\nfraud\u201d and that they would do whatever possible to restore\njustice. The Food Editors of Felix, who organised the com-petition, have not yet commented on the matter, as no-one\nhas managed to get in touch with them. O.T., winner of the\ncompetition, said that such actions are just acts of jealousy\nby the runner-ups and that her recipe was by far the best.\nSources from the Union told FELIX! that there are serious thoughts to remove the Food Section from the coming\nyear\u2019s paper if suspicions are proven to be true.\nWe would like to thank everybody who contributed to the\nFood Section this year. We were in big trouble every week\nediting all of the tempting recipes you were sending us. It would\nhave been much better though if you could\u2019ve also sent us a little\nto taste too! Special thanks to Yiango Mavroconstanti for her\ncontinuous and restless contribution, to Clare Cheng and Hannah\nCox for their vegan articles, Olivia Tillbert for all of her help and\nevery participant of the Imperial Master Chef competitions.\nFOOD AWARDS SCANDAL\nSOME SERIOUS SPECIAL THANKS\nIMPERIAL FOOD Food Editors: Anastasia Eleftheriou\nMichael Krestas\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHave you zeen Anaztazia orgr Michael lately?\n\n"

    "content": "M\norgan\u2019s first novel, The\nBend in the Sky, puts me\nless in mind of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\nand more of Vogon Poetry.\nThe prose is littered with clever asides which,\nwhile they are certainly entertaining stand-alones, for the most part distract the reader\nfrom the plotline. Morgan makes the mistake\nof trying to be funny rather than trying to be\ninteresting. This isn\u2019t always a problem, but\nBend in the Sky mimics the humour of Douglas Adams and, to a lesser extent, P.G. Wodehouse. Douglas Adams already pushed the\nfunny side of Hitchhiker\u2019s past exhaustion, it\nneedn\u2019t be pushed further.\nA great deal of the novel is spent trying to\navert a coming crisis, where Captain Jeltz \u2013\nsorry, Capias K*rargxt \u2013 is bringing his ship to\ndestroy the Earth. If he has a particular reason\nfor destroying the Earth it skips my mind right\nnow, but rest assured all 73 of his personalities\nwant the Earth destroyed on their route to ruling all of existence. When Kasteriskrargxt (as\nI shall now write his name) arrives on Earth\nhe will use his mind control rays to force our\ninnocent protagonists to act out a tragic script\nof unspeakable tragedy, overriding their character and free will.\nOh yes, characterisation. I don\u2019t have more\nthan a basic impression of most of the cast, not\nthe young guy who is young, nor his \u201cdropIf I had been born in 1888 and not 1988 I would\nhave been a suffragette. And I would venture\nthat it is impossible for anyone to read Emmeline\nPankhurst\u2019s My Own Story without feeling a similar sentiment.\nPankhurst begins by recounting the early days\nof the campaign for women\u2019s suffrage; the questioning of MPs at meetings and the sending of\nsmall delegations of women to parliament. She\nthen documents how the women\u2019s attempts\nto get enfranchised were met with opposition\nand how they responded to this with increasing\nenterprise.\nPankhurst\u2019s autobiography of 1914 is not only\nan informative account of the fight for women\u2019s\nsuffrage, but also a page turner from start to\nfinish; she was evidently an immensely talented\nwriter as well as a skilled political leader. She\ngives vivid accounts of hunger strikes, force\nfeeding, brutality, suicide, window breaking\nand arson. Indeed the book makes for a shocking read; women are mocked, derided, abused,\nwrongly imprisoned and worst of all, ignored.\nFrom the comfort of the 21st century it is impossible to imagine the social climate that led to the\npolice, prime ministers, cabinet and judiciary,\npeople whom today we hold in the highest es-teem, suppressing these women for so long. The\ninjustice to these poor vote-less ladies leaves\none feeling cold and numb and one is compelled\nto keep reading in order to see these women\nenfranchised. However the book disappointingly\nends abruptly in 1914, years before women get\nthe vote in 1918.\nMy Own Story is a manifestly one-sided account of the proceedings in which Pankhurst attempts to justify the suffragettes\u2019 increasingly\nmilitant actions. A comparison with an opposing\ntext would shed light on different view points, for\nexample that these ladies practised terrorism\nand in doing so delayed the achievement of their\ngoal. In any event though, My Own Story makes\nfor a thrilling read and we can rejoice in its distance from today.\nStephanie Walton\nHunger Games, Women\nand Politics\ndead gorgeous girlfriend\u201d who is happy to\nget her breasts out in a public park after the\nlaziest blackmail from a lewd photographer I\ncould imagine (and then she starts playing naked catch with the mind control ring \u2013 is this\na movie script?), nor the loan shark dodging\nformer immortal and his idiotic companion.\nPerhaps quick characterisation is a justifiable\nprice for a large cast in a fast paced novel, but\nI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a price The Bend in the Sky\ncan afford to pay. There just isn\u2019t enough char-acterisation for the mind control rays to take\naway.\nBut I do worry that I\u2019m judging too quickly.\nAs I read through The Bend in the Sky I started\nto appreciate the characters, the clever updat-ed-for-the-computer-age Hitchhiker\u2019s style,\nand the occasional original, hilarious aside.\nDoes the novel improve as it goes on, or did I\njust take time to learn to accept Morgan\u2019s unconventional prose? The former, I\u2019m afraid.\nI don\u2019t feel the novel as a whole is more than\nthe sum of its parts, these bits of wonder don\u2019t\nfit together as well as the apparently disconnected adventures of Bertie Wooster.\nMany good writers, such as Philip Pullman,\nhave novels early in their career that now embarrass them terribly, and are no worse now\nfor the experience. When Morgan has written a\nfew more novels, I\u2019ll certainly go out and read\nthem, and wouldn\u2019t discourage you from doing the same. If you really like them go back\nand give The Bend in the Sky a try. Until then,\ngive it a miss.\n* This isn\u2019t a footnote, K*rargxt just has the\nmisfortune of an asterisk in his name. Morgan\navoids the sin of footnotes, but makes up for it\nwith the heavy overuse of italics.\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012\n30\nThe Bend in the Sky\nJoseph Henderson reviews a promising but flawed debut\nNot so Exquisite a Specimen\nWith the News of the World no longer in print\nyou\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that paedophilia\nis no longer a \u2018thing\u2019. But it is, dear reader, it is\n\u2013 at least in my world. In the last few months\nI\u2019ve read no fewer than two novels on the sub-ject. One, a classic \u2013 Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov \u2013 and the other a recently released novel\nby Imperial alumnus Paul West \u2013 Exquisite\nSpecimens. Both are written in the first person\nand both are pretty disturbing.\nExquisite Specimens is, according to its au-thor, 50% autobiography. Like its author, the\nbook\u2019s protagonist, Simon, is a Cambridge\ngraduate taking a PHD in Metallurgy at our\nown Imperial College. The book follows him\nduring his first year of PhD here. It\u2019s certainly\nfun to read about somewhere so familiar \u2013 the\nsame Cromwell Road and the same museums.\nThe book\u2019s theme is also one that will be as\nfamiliar to the stereotypical Imperial student as\nthe mockingly erect Queen\u2019s Tower \u2013 sexual\nfrustration. We read of Simon making out with\na gas cylinder in his lab and venturing into\nSoho\u2019s specialist bookstores. He has his first\ngirlfriend in this year, managing to chat up a\nyoung French woman after taking several valium pills to calm his nerves. Their sexual encounters are described in graphic detail, with\nRory Fenton one ending with him vomiting from nervous-ness. West paints himself as a very odd, geeky,\nsocially reclusive character who fakes some of\nhis PhD research to have time to spend with his\nFrench lover. The feeling of honesty that one\ngets is a strong point for the book, enabling it\nto paint a clear portrait of an awkward scientist\nand showing a side of Imperial life the average\nstudent wouldn\u2019t be aware of, even if it makes\nfor an uncomfortable read at times.\nSo far so good but the honesty goes further.\nA lot further. Simon starts to fantasise about\nschoolgirls, specifically those who come to\nSouth Kensington on school trips for the mu-seums. He describes how he walks down Exhibition Road with his hand dangling freely to\nrub against the girls. Taken as a work of fiction (and here\u2019s hoping it falls into the 50%\nthat is fictional) it fails to offer much more to\nthe reader than fact rather than explanation or\nunderstanding. We shouldn\u2019t be afraid to read\nnovels that make us uncomfortable, books that\nallow us to see the world through the eyes of\nan outcast. Crime and Punishment gives the\nreader the under-standing experience of the\nguilt that comes from being a murderer without necessarily requiring us to agree with mur-der. This is what happens in Lolita. We hear,\nin his own words, the story of Humbert and\nhis obsession and eventual sexual relationship\nwith 12-year-old Dolores Haze, nicknamed\n\u2018Lolita\u2019. The reader is not left with any doubt\nthat this relationship is deeply wrong but\nNabokov still manages to present things from\nHumbert\u2019s view and how he considered himself justified, taking us on a tour of Humbert\u2019s\nmind. We actually get to understand this man\u2019s\nthinking. We find it disturbing and perverse but\nwe understand and are better for it.\nConversely, a novel that describes only the\nactions of such an outcast, even in first person,\nfalls into voyeurism. Reading Exquisite Specimens feels like this, like we are reading the story of a sexually deviant man without learning\nanything deeper, without getting into his head.\nSo unless the reader wants to read about sexual\nperversion for its own sake, they stand to gain\nlittle from reading.\nTo an extent, the book is interesting as an\nhonest insight into the life of an Imperial PhD\nstudent but as it progresses, it leaves the reader\nwondering why they are actually reading the\nbook in the first place. We feel more like flies-on-the-wall than in his shoes and the more uncomfortable for it. Novels can tackle difficult\nsubjects, even paedophilia, but they need to\ntake their reader on a journey with them. Otherwise we end up feeling little better than the\ndisturbed characters they portray. This, unfor-tunately, is the case with Exquisite Specimens.\nIMPERIAL BOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

The following year, Imperial managed to overcome a few of their opponents, but\nmissed out on the knock-out stages because of goal difference and some rather questionable refereeing on behalf of\nthe hosts. In 2010 the squad became\nlarger and players from previous years\nwould return to the club for one weekend to celebrate and play handball.\nHowever, the celebration appeared to\nget in the way of the handball. A strong\ngroup draw paired with an even stronger hangover lead to Imperial having\nto surrender to the French again. Although not very successful, this year\nproved to be the turning point for the\nclub and their sporting ambition, because in 2011 Imperial would come\nback much stronger. At that time, the\nclub was renowned for its off-court in-volvement. The Eagles were loved and\ntreasured by all their fellow sportsmen\nand sportswomen as friends, but this\nwas the year they would be feared as\nopponents. After some superb Handball in the group stages, including an\nimpressive win against Lille (finalist\nthat year), the Eagles had made it into\nthe knock-out stages for the first time.\nThe quarter final was played in the big\nsports hall with many spectators and\nentire battalions of fanfares to support\ntheir opponent - Centrale Nancy also\nknown as the alligators or the NancyBoys. The big stage turned out to be\ntoo much for the Eagles, who failed to\nconvert 3 clear chances to take the lead\nin the dying minutes of the second half\nand lost by merely one goal. The girls\nteam, in their maiden year, were remarkably successful in their group and\nreached the quarterfinals too, where\nthey would suffer a similar fate to the\nmen\u2019s team.\nIt was an agonising wait for the next\nchance to show the world what the club\nhas become over the last 4 years, but it\ncame at the UK University Championships in February. Imperial comfortably beat future champions Essex in\nthe group stages and only narrowly\nlost to the hosts from Manchester University in the penalty shoot-out of the\nsemifinals. A strong defensive display\nand the incredible fighting spirit were\nrewarded with third place in the end,\nbut it was devastating for everyone\ninvolved to come so close to a place\nin the final and yet go home with the\nbronze medal around their neck. The\nteam continued to work hard and two\nweeks later would cruise to a comfortable second place in the charity dodgeball tournament at which point Lucas\nCarstens said \u201c3rd in Manchester, 2nd\nin dodgeball,... We sall come 1st in\nLyon!\u201d\nOn 16 March, Eagles from across Europe spread their wings and gathered in\nLyon. For the first time, Imperial could\nenter 2 men\u2019s teams into the competition and a women\u2019s team, forming a\ndelegation of 32 players.

    "content": "IC 1st XI begin ULU Campaign with crushing win!\nStefan Bauer, who has been on all 5\ntrips that Eagles made to France said\n\u201cI would never have dreamed that one\nday we will be able to compete with\nFrench Universities at such a high lev-el. What the club has achieved over the\nlast 5 years is immense and it would\nhave been impossible without the commitment of all the members. We have\nno BUCS points to win and no money\nto spend, but every week people come\nand give their best to make this team as\ngood as it can be. It\u2019s touching.\u201d\nThe draw was not easy as there were\nonly 3 teams per group and 4 knockout games, including the final, to win\nthe trophy. This means that every game\ncould be the last one if the teams are\ncomplacent. The Imperial 2nd team,\nlargely consisting of Imperial players\nfrom years gone by, was set to face\nLyons alumni\u2019s and ECN. Expectantly, they proved to be too difficult for\na team that has never played in this\nformation. After 2 very entertaining\nmatches, the veterans joined the first\nteam in the quest for the title. Meanwhile, the girls team could repeat their\ncoup from last year and edge past Centrale Lyon, Paris and Polytechnique\nto secure a place in the quarterfinals.\nAn impressive result for a team that\nwas founded merely 2 years ago and\nthe result of hard work on their be-half. Captain Annabelle Mayers commented \u201cWe try to be realistic with our\nexpectations, but the last 2 years have\nshown that we can compete with much\nmore established clubs, which is very\nencouraging for the next years\u201d. The\nmen\u2019s first team was set to face last\nyear\u2019s finalist Lille in their first game\nbefore trying to fend off Lyons 3rd\nteam. In typical Eagles fashion they\nwould have a shaky start, but managed\nto control Lille\u2019s left handed half-back,\nthere only source of danger and win the\ngame. This was followed by a convincing 17:0 win over the hosts 3rd team in\nwhat turned out to be a practice game.\nIn the round of 16, IC had to face\nPolytechnique, the French military\nacademy and their most renown engineering school who traditionally have\nstrong sports teams. It was also the\nformer school of Thibault Hervier, the\nEagles\u2019 right wing player, which made\nthis a very prestigious game. A surprisingly static opponent with a severe lack\nof creativity made it easy for the Eagles\nwho were reinforced by players from\ntheir 2nd team at this stage, first and\nforemost Romain Henry, who proved\nto be a vital addition in the games to\ncome. The quarterfinal was reached\nand spirits were high, when we got the\nnews that IC had to face their nemesis\n\u2013 the Nancy-Boys. Suddenly there was\nan elephant in the room and people remembered their tragic defeat to the Alligators the year before. Imperial fell\nback to their shaky way of playing and\nlost balls carelessly while at the same\ntime struggling to defend Nancy\u2019s very\nshort and windy play-maker from Portugal and brutish-looking right-back.\nOn the other side of the court, a man\nwho looked as if he was a laboratory\nproduct specially designed to be hit\nhard by balls proved difficult for the\neagles shooters to overcome. With\nmerely 3 minutes to go Nancy took a\ntime-out and the Eagles gathered near\nthe centre-line with their heads down.\nIt was that moment when Max Flashback\u2019s motivational speech and Kristof\nK\u00f6lker\u2019s determined yet rather crude\nshouting woke the inner fighting spirit\nof the representatives from London. In\nthese 3 minutes, Imperial would not\nconcede a goal and score 3 themselves,\nthanks to Stefan Bauer finally finding\nhis way into what Roberto Galli refers\nto as \u201cthe Zone\u201d and some rather intelligent play in attack. Having equalised\nin the dying seconds of the game, the\nImperial Eagles had to overcome another ghost from their past \u2013 a penalty\nshootout. Having lost to Manchester\nUniversity in this situation only one\nmonth ago, no one was keen to shoot at\nfirst. However, Charles Missiaen rose\nto the occasion and 4 brave men would\nfollow him soon after that. Imperial\ngot the advantage when the brutish\nNancy-Boy saw his shot come off the\npost. The Nancy goalkeeper felt brave\nenough to take a penalty himself, but\nImperials goalkeeper got the better of\nhim and saved his shot with a brilliant\nstop to his bottom right, meaning that\nthe Eagles had the chance to win it with\nthe 4th penalty. Thibault Hervier made\nno mistake and sealed the place in the\nsemi-final, much to the delight of Lucas Carstens, who was left speechless\nby the intense encounter.\nAs the team moved into the big venue for the semi-finals, greeted by fanfares and bewildered looking Frenchmen, they were given the sad news\nthat the girls team was only narrowly\ndefeated in the quarterfinal in a venue\nthe other side of Lyon. This meant that\nit was on the Eagles to defend the honour of the Club against Telecom Paris,\nwho despite their short stature were\nrumoured to have played a very good\ntournament up to then. In their first at-tack, the windy Parisian left wing left\nthe Imperial defence flummoxed with\na quick return pass from his neighbour\nand opened the scoring. Stefan Bauer,\nmotivated by the crucial penalty safe in\nthe quarterfinal and keen to make his\n5th trip to Lyon the stuff of legends,\nwas determined to show the audience\nthat there is a quality player behind\nthat neon truck on his goalkeeping\nshirt and prevented the Eagles from\nfalling too far behind with a sprawling safe against the right wing trying\nto convert a counterattack. In attack, a\nclever mixture between the relentless\nforce of Kolja Ortmann and Adrian\nNadal on the line and fast waves of\nattack from Kristof Koelker, Charles\nMissiaen opened gaps for shots from\nthe back position through Lucas\nCarstens and Max Flashback, as well\nas the wing positions through Roberto\nGalli and Thibault Hervier. In defence,\nan ever-so-reliable Romain Henry took\ncare of every opponent coming his\nway and swift movements from along\nthe 6 metre line prevented Paris from\nfinding any gap big enough to trouble\nImperials goalkeeper. So it came that,\ndespite being one goal down at half\ntime, Imperial secured a place in the final of the Challenge Centrale Lyon for\nthe first time ever.\nIt was a draining day and sleeping\nin tents on a rainy night in the south\nof France (if they slept at all) did not\nhelp the team. The 8am throw-off\nagain Centrale Paris, who overcame\nthe hosts first team in the semi-final\nand put an end to their hopes of winning the title for the 11th time on a row,\nwas the last hurdle for the Eagles on\ntheir route to glory and fame. Joined\nby future president Yannick Seis and\nleft-handed veteran Ruben Freytag,\nIC was determined to make it count.\nApart from conceding an early counterattack in the opening minute of the\ngame, the Eagles made no mistake\nand remained in control of the game\nthroughout. Stefan Bauer with probably the best goalkeeping display the\ntournament has seen in years gave the\nImperial the confidence to dominate\ntheir opponents in their own half. A\nmixture of fast counter attacks via the\nwing positions, powerful shots from\nthe 9-metre-line by the half-backs and\npure physical strength on the line-positions gave the visitors from London the upper hand. The game ended\n18:20 for the Eagles. It is a beautiful\nstory of team-work, determination and\ntaking the initiative that lead them to\nthis point and one that surely deserves\nrecognition. Knowing the team, they\nwill not be complacent, but continue to\nwork hard and ensure they can sustain\ntheir efforts and maybe even surprise\nsome unsuspecting Germans at the\nIDEA League in the summer.\nFrench success for Handball\n...Continued from Back Page\nHandball standing triumphant\nFollowing a week of rain, few expected a match to be played. Yet Sunday\ndawned cloudless, paving the way for\none of the most exciting cricket matches to have ever been played by an Imperial team.\nCaptained by William Baker, the 2nd\nXI arrived at Fortress H (renamed from\nHarlington by one confident member\nof the team earlier that morning) to\nlose the toss and be asked to bowl. The\npitch, as can be imagined by its uncovered nature, was damp and slow.\nPresident Ian Woolf got the team of\nto a good start by dismissing one of\nthe opening batsmen for just 3. This\nwas swiftly followed by a sharp piece\nof work in the field by Vignesh Venkateswaran, running out their number 3\nbatsman for a duck.\nHowever, King\u2019s managed to steady\nthe ship with a partnership of 58 runs.\nIt was at this point that Captain Baker\ndelivered a masterstroke by introducing\nthe left-hand orthodox spin of Vignesh.\nHe struck with his very first ball, the\numpire adjudging the remaining opening batsman to be out LBW.\nVignesh, it seems, was everywhere.\nHe was involved in the first three dismissals and proceeded to be involved\nin the next three, grabbing two more\nwickets himself and taking another fine\ncatch. King\u2019s were being held together\nby their helmetless number 4 batsman,\nbut once he was dismissed by Captain\nBaker, they were struggling at 106/6.\nWith the final 10 overs upon them,\nthe remaining King\u2019s batsmen were\npushing for every run. A mix-up and\na good throw in from the deep ended\na good cameo by their number 8 bats-man, which had pushed their score up\nto 157/8. The drama, however, was just\nstarting. In the final over of the innings,\ntheir number 11 batsman was bowled\nby a ball bouncing twice. He thought\nthat constituted a no-ball, however the\numpire gave it out. In an act of wonderful sportsmanship, Captain Baker\nrecalled the batsman despite the grum-blings of his bowler. As it turned out,\nnot another run was scored with the\nbatsman being run-out of the final ball\nattempting a quick single.\nSet 168 to win, Imperial embarked\nupon the chase cautiously, reaching\nthe end of the 10th over with a score\nof 28/2.Opener Anmol Bedi prevented\na collapse with a studious innings of\n29 from 55 deliveries, but aside from a\n28-ball 17 from in-form Ahsaan Ismail,\nreceived little support. At the halfway\nstage, Imperial were 69/4 requiring 99\nruns from the next 20 overs.\nIn strode Vignesh, who immediately increased the team\u2019s run-rate. As\nthe last recognised batsman, it was up\nto him guide the team home. He hit a\ncouple of lovely cover-drives for four,\nwhich were then followed by a glorious\nsix. However, wickets were still falling\naround him and to make matters worse,\nhe started suffering from cramps.\nThe score with 10 overs to play was\n114/7. At the crease were Vignesh with\na runner and Ian Woolf. Slowly, but\nsurely they began to haul in the target.\nWith the field pushed out for Vignesh,\nhe could only obtain singles, but for\nIan, the field was in and he responded\nby wielding the willow with tremendous effect, scoring some much needed\nboundaries.\nWith 12 runs to win however, Vignesh\nwent for one big shot too many and\nwas caught. The tension in the dressing room was palpable. The number\n10 batsman walking out to the middle,\nGanesh Kumar, was known only for his\nbig swing. Nevertheless, Ian showed\ncomposure born of 4 years at Imperial\nand reduced the equation from 11 runs\nof 12 balls to 2 runs of the last 6, by\nhitting a magnificent four over cover.\nGanesh was on strike for the final over\nto their opening bowler and seemed intent on finishing the job with one hit.\nIndeed the bat flew out of his hands at\none point, but he failed to make contact\nwith 4 consecutive balls. 2 runs required now from 2. A single was somehow taken, leaving Ian on strike with\nthe scores level. Then, with a hit past\nmid-off, the match was won.\nCricket\nRajiv Bhur\n\u201cthe Imperial Eagles\nhad to overcome\nanother ghost from\ntheir past\u201d\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012 39\nIMPERIAL SPORT\nSport Editor: Indy LeTwerp\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Some say he shouldn\u2019t\nhave disregarded the obvious early warning signs such as losing his hair and not\nbeing able to ejaculate without watching\nporn, but no one could have foreseen Jason\u2019s dark decent in to feral life.\nIn a bizarre public display, Jason tore his\nclothes off while surrounded by his peers\nand ran away. He was found weeks later\nby a elderly couple out dogging by Richmond park (who decided that the Sasquatch-like corpse wouldn\u2019t put them off)\nin a very compromising position. Allegedly,\nJason\u2019s body was found with his non-dom-inant hand wrapped around his 3\u201d penis\n(very thorough journalistic investigation was\nconducted to obtain this accurate figure).\nThe autopsy confirmed that he had placed\na hard straight twig down his urethra, presumably for heightened pleasure while\nmasturbating. The deviant sex act for one is\nsaid to have caused an infection that would\nnormally have been treated by broad\nspectrum antibiotics, however Imperial College Medical centre couldn\u2019t arrange an\nappointment for several years.\nJason died the way he like to live. Erect. If\nit wasn\u2019t for Jason\u2019s work on online podcast-ing, future students would have to actually\nattend lectures. Thank You Jason. R.I.P.\nE\nvery single week, Nic almost\nthought about maybe doing\nwork. One time this term, he\nnotably turned up to the office at 2pm \u2013 beating his\nprevious record by an entire\nhour. He worked tirelessly for\nmany weeks to get posters in\nthe toilets, an aim that he has left to his successor to finish. Many students have fond\nmemories of the Green Week he organ-ised. One student, who FELIX! stopped in\nthe library, said: \u201cwhat and when was that?\nNow piss off and let me get a potato.\u201d\nNot satisfied with his office being a place\nof work, he converted it into a sex dungeon,\nluckily the supply of free condoms came in\nuseful. Unfortunately, Durex couldn\u2019t keep\nup a steady enough supply to keep it\npacked out. Pasante fortunately stepped in\nat the last minute.\nHis unfortunate demise was only discovered when he didn\u2019t turn up to work for a\nweek. The next week, the staff at the Union started to become worried as this was\na new record and decided to investigate.\nWhen they went into his dungeon, they\nfound several \u2018respectable\u2019 politicians, who\nall suddenly pretended they had \u2018walked\ninto the wrong room\u2019 and \u2018were on a tour\u2019\nand had \u2018lost their boxers\u2019.\nA whole team of detectives, including Benedict Cumberbatch, who was chosen as he\nhas played Sherlock Holmes, and therefore\nmust be good at finding people, were all on\nthe hunt for the missing Deputy President.\nNic died in an unfortunate pubic hair shaving incident: he was shot while shaving his\npubic hairs, by a student who really wanted\nto see a poster in a toilet. His ashes were\nburied, in free condoms, around Beit Quad.\nS\necret and Lad are two\nwords not normally associated with Felix Editor Matt\nColvin (also known as The\nColvinator), however this\ngoes to prove Matt\u2019s lad-dish behaviour was indeed\nthat secret. Colvin Secret\nLad was spotted at various points throughout the year, continually on the prowl, ever\nsearching for his next release of sexual ten-sion. Something that occurred quite often\nin order to alleviate the wounds suffered\nfrom furiously typing on his keyboard 18\nhours a day, resting only to sleep, eat, forni-cate, and sometimes deliver the newspaper\naround college on time.\nUnfortunately the wounds became too se-vere, both physically and mentally. The constant nightmares of the Daily Mail calling\nMatt about an illicit article broke his originally solid mental wellbeing, reducing him\nto the point where he had no option but to\nshear his fingers off with a pneumatic press\njust so he couldn\u2019t write anymore. Just when\nhe felt the sweet release of responsibility,\nMatt came to realise that a life with no fingers was more tormenting than that before.\nHe wasn\u2019t able to maintain the existence he\nonce treasured, worse yet he was unable to\ntake his own life.\nFortunately, his pain was alleviated when\nhe was crushed to death by a large iMac\nand several broken keyboards. These fell\nfrom the top of a wardrobe on the one occasion he nearly cleaned up the FELIX! of-fice. He may have escaped, had a stack of\nun-filed FELIX! back issues not hit him in the\nhead. Matt was only found when The Times\ncalled him up wanting a quote. Reportedly,\nhis last words were \u201clessons must be learnt\u201d.\nIMPERIAL HANGMAN\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012 37\nET GRISLY ENDS.

No change\nthere then\n\u201cBecause gravity and physics can\ngo die in a fire.\u201d\nNEXT WEEK!!!\nFelix Games reviews Garbage Truck Simulator!!!\n(Seriously, who comes up with this rubbish? Geddit,\nrubbishgame,garbagesimulator?Thosewordsmean\nthe same, that\u2019s what makes it funny. Oh never mind.)\nFELIX EXCLUSIVE!!!\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing you\u2019ve never lived. Criticisms against it have admittedly been harsh \u2013 \u201cBuggy as hell\u201d; \u201cA complete\nwaste of time\u201d; \u201cI\u2019d rather gouge my eyeballs out with\na fork than play this s$*& again\u201d and \u201cStupid f&$*ing\npiece of God-damn bulls*%$ motherf*%&er\u201d are a\nfew of the tamer ones.\nThe \u2018bugs\u2019 in the game are pretty much all over the\nshop. Your driving competitors never move from the\nstart line, you can accelerate beyond the speed of\nsound, drive through buildings like they\u2019re made of thin\nair and climb up vertical slopes like gravity and friction\nare merely optional laws of nature.\nYour average person sees these \u2018flaws\u2019 and thinks\n\u2018Buggy game, waste of time\u2019. A smarter individual realises that Big Rigs is not a sloppily designed game but\nis in fact an intellectual masterpiece, tapping into the\ndeepest desires of the human psyche.\nIn life we are constrained by the immutable laws of\nnature. Gravity pins us to Mother Earth, a burden each\nof us must face and come to terms with. Big Rigs frees\nus and allows us to realise, if only for a moment, a pure\nworld in which gravity and physical laws do not constrain human actions.\nBig Rigs must also be viewed as an anti-depres-sant, rescuing many from their own\ndark thoughts. In a fiercely competitive world things grow overwhelming,\nthreatening to crush even the most\nhard-working and motivated individu-al. By removing any challenge, freezing your opponents in place, Big Rigs\nensures victory after victory, helping to\nreinforce an individual\u2019s self-worth. A\ntruly noble cause.\nBut the supposed \u2018bug\u2019 that hits\ndeepest is the ability to leave the map,\nentering a void of purity and nothing-ness. It is obvious that this is a representation of Heaven. You transcend the\nboundaries of the mortal realm, entering a realm of inner peace and purity.\nYou have no more goals, no demands\nto meet, nothing. You are but a free\nspirit, floating in the big emptiness. It is\nenough to draw a tear to my eye.\nDo not hate upon Big Rigs. What initially appears to be a flawed game is\nin fact a modern masterpiece, a complicated simulator to break free of re-ality, if only for a few precious hours.\nOr maybe it\u2019s just a buggy piece\nof trash that was churned out over a\nweekend by an incompetent studio to\nmake a quick profit *shrugs*.\nIMPERIAL GAMES Games Editor: Laurence [insert\nhilarious name here] Pope\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "RECTOR PIES HIMSELF SILLY\nPARK SCANDAL: KATY COULD-DO-BETTERANY REPORTS\nJournalists in court is a common sight nowadays; but FELIX! never imagined the day that one of\nits own editors would take the stand. The self-styled John \u201cWhite Ribbon\u201d Park, who is currently\nstanding trial for the alleged stalking of leading lady Madeline Stowe, 53, was today rocked by\nallegations of illiteracy, as part of an expos\u00e9 detailed in The Telegraph.\nPark, whose reputation is already in tatters, was arrested in 2011 after he was caught lurking\noutside Stowe\u2019s Mayfair apartment. The star of popular US drama Revenge, alleges that she had\nbeen obsessively followed for several months prior to the arrest by an unknown male, as well as being sent explicit letters and photographs. \u201cI feared for my life \u2013 wherever I went, he was there. I\u2019m a\nlady who is used to admirers, but I knew that this was something different \u2013 something more sinister.\u201d\nOf course, Park\u2019s rampant lust for the older woman is no secret \u2013 his recent film reviews have been\nstrewn with the idolatry of stars such as Charlize Theron. Some students will also be aware of the\nmany accusations regarding dalliances with certain senior female lecturers that surround the troubled young editor.\nIt was sometime after his arrest in September that undercover journalists from The Telegraph\nstarted secretly monitoring his private correspondence. In a shocking twist of events, it has been\nrevealed that Park, far from being the talented editor the College thought they knew, would struggle\nto differentiate a punctuation colon from his own colon (a claim further substantiated by his lack of\ntalent in his chosen field, medicine.) His command of the English language, described by The Telegraph\u2019s inside men as \u201cdismal\u201d; has been largely covered up by his co-editor, copy editors and the\nuse of spell-check.\nThe deception, already being described as \u201cthe cover-up of the decade\u201d, will come as no surprise\nto people close to Park. We asked a family friend, who opted to remain anonymous, for a reaction.\n\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t even know he spoke English. He edits which paper?\u201d With reports of \u2018Bullying in the Workplace\u2019 allegations also made against him, it is clear that Park is in for a rocky few\nmonths. Park was today unavailable for comment, but sources close to him have speculated that if\nfound guilty, he will use the inevitable custodial time to enroll himself on an English course.\nRector (or should that be President & Rector? Help me out\nhere I\u2019m genuinely confused) Sir Keith O\u2019Nions was the\ncentre of yet another minor pie-based scandal last week-end, after attempting to pie himself in the face in front of\na small party of alumni. \u201cI took inspiration from RAG when\nthey pied me the other month. If they can raise awareness\nthrough such a simple act, why can\u2019t I?\u201d\nThe alumni present at this fictional event were largely unimpressed. \u201cI prefer it when he just makes\nsmall talk with us. Anyway, I\u2019m basically allergic\nto pastry, so I\u2019m doubly underwhelmed. I literally\ncould\u2019ve broken out into a mild rash.\u201d\nIMPERIAL gossip\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012\n4\nIn an act reminiscent of the traditions\nof countless maniacal dictators, next\nyear\u2019s FELIX! Editor, the incorrigible\nand unpronounceable Tim Arbabzadah, has fired the entire editorial\nstaff, with the changes coming into\neffect right now.\nThe tyrant commented to FELIX! on\nthe monumentous decision \u201cI just\nwant a fresh start, you know? Man\u2019s\ngot work to do.\u201d\nNEW EDITOR FIRES\nEVERYONE\nfired!\n\n"

    "content": "Scott Heath Ledger Michael Foster Monya Zard\nS\nome may remember Scott\nas a man of indifference,\nhowever throughout his\ntroubled career as a student politician not one person could deny that he did\nhis upmost to follow Union\nconstitution to the letter.\nMany questioned the work Scott did over\nhis year in office, with the majority of his\nobservable time spent with senior college\nofficials; wining and dining with the best\nof them. While no benefits for the student\nbody came from said meetings, he did end\nthe year with CV references rivalled only\nby Prince Harry.\nScott\u2019s biggest attribute to the student\nexperience can only be summed up by his\nconstitution changes proposed at his highly\ndesolate General Meeting. The deep sorrow he felt while realising that the world Is\nbigger than Imperial College Union and its\npedantic constitution can only be imagined\nby the most creative of us, those of us who\nwould have been an Art History student in a\ndifferent life sans competitive parents. Like\nthe great actor Heath Ledger, his work will\nsurely be recognised after his passing.\nWhy Scott thought he could deepthroat\na chicken escalope baguette from the infamous Sandwich Shop is anyone\u2019s guess,\nbut if anything, he knew what he was doing\nthis time. He finally took a stance and stuck\nwith it. Fortunately the baguette stuck in his\nthroat, ridding the world of another sycophantic middle man.\nTo say there would never be another man\nlike Scott Heath would be of credit to his\ncharacter, however this is not the case. The\nstudent body has elected another middle\nclass white man to fill the same size 9 shoes.\nH\nis year was all seemingly occurring without\ntoo much incident, until\nhe unwittingly was bestowed with the title of\nReturning Officer for\nthe Big Elections. This\ncaused him to have a\nmental break down and become something\nof a renegade. Michael was on the run\nfrom the police, with only an Excel spreadsheet and sporadic access to eActivities to\nkeep him occupied. He was eventually apprehended when detectives were able to\ntrack his movements via a tweet he posted\nabout angrily having to approve invoices,\nor whatever it is he does.\nMichael, known to his friends simply as Michael, was dragged out of the Starbucks\nhe was residing in, kicking and screaming\nshouting \u201cjust let me rubber stamp one more\npayment!\u201d He was taken to a rough jail on a\nfar away island and quickly became friends\nwith all of the most powerful inmates. Multiple times the guards were accused of torturing Michael, by not allowing him to use\nExcel, but rather insisting he makes tables in\nWord. However, the US Government, who\nrun the jail, replied belligerently by saying\n\u201cla la la we\u2019re not listening, can\u2019t hear you,\nsorry, your question is invalid as my fingers\nare in my ears\u201d, the spokesman then stuck\nhis head in the ground. Very soon after his\narrival, he became the guard\u2019s favourite inmate when he started doing all of their tax\nreturns for them.\nSome speculate that it was suicide in the\nend. He was found slumped in his cell with\na stethoscope tightly wrapped around his\nnether regions and a grin on his face, possibly a throwback to his days as a medic.\nI\nt was always going to be a tough\nyear for Monya. At the very start of\nher year she had to organise Freshers\u2019 Fair. This required her to tire-lessly, meticulously, and methodically\ntake the plans from last year and\nchange the date at the top. She was\nalso required to write a whole 100\nwords in a box and so the first month\u2019s salary was well-earned.\nDetectives are still investigating the suspicious circumstances of the \u2018accident\u2019 that\nbefell her in the end. The New Clubs Committee, who some of you may know (obvi-ously just kidding, as nobody would know)\nseemed \u201cstrangely jolly\u201d during the funeral.\nMonya was walking across the shared\nspace on Exhibition Road, and didn\u2019t know\nwhere to cross as the Union hadn\u2019t lobbied\nthe local council hard enough to clarify.\nIt turns out her confidence in the \u2018shared\nspace\u2019 meaning that cars will look out for\npedestrians was tragically high. She was\nrun over by a stampede of horses, analogous to the end of Mufasa in The Lion King,\nalthough less children cried and her voice\nwasn\u2019t the same as Darth Vader. It\u2019s also\nless likely that she will speak to students as\na cloud in the sky at any point.\nSurprisingly, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was actually\non the scene and standing two metres away\nat the time of the fateful incident. When\nquestioned during the investigation he reportedly said that he \u201ccould not comment\u201d\nas he \u201cdid not see the incident clearly\u201d. This\nis contrary to reports that he was staring at\nit intently.\nIt has been said that a certain Mayor of\nthe city allegedly wasn\u2019t on hand as he was\ntoo busy chasing off muggers screaming\n\u201coiks\u201d. Wenger also did not see this incident.\nIMPERIAL HANGMAN\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012\n36\nSHOCK EXCLUSIVE: SABBATICAL TEAM ALL MEE\n\n"

    "content": "One of the things I\u2019ve found weird at uni is summer\nplans. Instead of taking advantage of the long holidays \u2013 and we\u2019ll never get it as good as now, even if\nwe all become teachers \u2013 by going home, chilling on\na beach or just dossing somewhere and sleeping for\n3 months, there\u2019s this weird obsession with doing something productive (and by that I mean with\nthe aim of improving your employment prospects).\nBeing bombarded with info on the latest internships and how I\nshould go into careers x, y or z is very nice, but when I\u2019m 18, and\nfor all intents and purposes still a schoolboy (spring work at a bank\nbeing one example, with the application deadline before January)\nshouldn\u2019t be top of my priorities \u2013 enjoying my time at uni (hard\nas that may be) and just loving life whilst I can should be. Now a\nsecond year, I had to see my personal tutor about if I had any, and\nif not, then why? I understood he was caring about what I want to\ndo with my life, and the answer was \u2018I\u2019m 19, how do I know what\nI want to do for the next 40 years, I don\u2019t even know what I want\nfor tea tonight?\u2019. It was McDonald\u2019s in the end.\nInstead of having a holiday, my friends from halls etc. are\nspending it at SocGen, Barclays and the like, or working in\nlabs around the country (and at the poor excuse for research\nfacilities they call UCL) and by not doing so, because I want\nto go home, wake up at midday and just have a nice relaxing\nholiday before third year \u2013 which is what Summer Holidays\nare about \u2013 I\u2019m somehow in the wrong. After turning 19 six\nmonths before (and still an irresponsible teenager who isn\u2019t\neven that good at doing laundry or washing up, never mind\ntrying to solve/contribute to the financial crisis or the world\u2019s\nother pressing issues) the deadlines for half the internships\nhad passed and I felt like I had missed a beat. But had I? Or is\nmy general reluctance to get a real job (and become a functional\nmember of society) something that student\u2019s no longer have? Is my\ntime at Imperial just a stepping stone to one of the predefined \u2018careers\u2019 I get told about in weekly emails. I don\u2019t know; I just want to\nspend the summer playing FIFA and watching One Tree Hill (which is\napparently what I\u2019ll be doing on graduation in two years now that\nI\u2019m unemployable). I\u2019m even doing an extra year at uni because I\ndon\u2019t want to be part of the real world, so whilst I admire those\nof us who already know what we want to do and when, I have to\nwonder: wouldn\u2019t spending the summer lying on a beach (or just\nin bed waiting for mum to cook some dinner) be what we\u2019re used\nto spending our holidays doing. Although, going on a rugby tour/\nclimbing trip/wandering around Montenegro would be nice as well.\nIt\u2019s the holidays, not a time to be doing anything of note really? Or\nis it?\nTo be honest I\u2019m not entirely sure if we are all just very career\ndriven or driven into careers by other factors \u2013 the pressure to\nfind jobs, the horror of being unemployed or just \u2018everyone else\nhas, probably should\u2019. I\u2019m only 20 for God\u2019s sake, I still enjoy pick\nand mix and laugh at fart jokes, am I really ready to kickstart my\ncareer/PhD or do I just want to go home/spend 2 weeks glued to\na sunbed. I thought uni was all about the long holidays, occasional\nall-nighters, and just having fun whilst avoiding the real world and\nwork, not desperately trying to find it (and being a failure if you\ncan\u2019t/won\u2019t).\n\u2013 Jack Hewitt\nTHESIS CLAUS\nMaybe your eyes were drawn to this article because you thought there might be a\nspelling error in the title, or maybe not (shame\non you). Nevertheless, it must be clear to you\nthat I have not made an error but I am in fact\nreferring to a small mascot, whose abode is that\nof my humble PhD student desk. This said toy\nis dressed in red with white trimmings and has\na look of geniality that becomes his patronly\nposition. However, having Thesis Claus on your\ndesk does come with responsibility \u2013 for he is\nmaking a list and checking it twice!\nMaybe I invented Thesis Claus to remind myself of the reward-driven nature of research\nand how important it is to stay focused on a\ngoal in order to get anywhere in life \u2013 (actual-ly I invented him as an excuse to sing\nChristmas carols in my head any\ntime of the year, but we will\nstick with the former argu-ment). Indeed, research\nis hard work and the\nidea of completing a\nthesis to a PhD student is as exciting as\nChristmas is to a three\nyear old.\nSo perhaps you are\na student who needs\nideas for your own desk\nmascot. A howling monkey or an angry bird may\nseem appropriate depending on how you feel about your\nwork, but perhaps it is better to choose\nsomething more conducive to productivity? That\nsaid, mascots aren\u2019t only for scientists. You could\nbe a medical student who practices examinations on a teddy, or a business student presenting a pitch to a panel of plush toys. Maybe it\u2019s\nnot so bad having to face a soft critic once in a\nwhile to feel good about yourself.\n\u2013 Anonymous\nSUMMER CHILLING\nFRIDAY 22 JUNE 2012 13\nO\nd\nIMPERIAL COMMENT\n\n"

    "content": "RETURN OF THE QUEEN\nWith recent revelations confirming rumours that The\nGreen Lantern is in fact, homosexual, DC Comics has\ndecided to cash in on the appeal and immense media\ninterest surrounding their superhero\u2019s coming-out\ncelebrations. The most recent DC film project\nin the pipeline, Zack Snyder\u2019s Man of Steel,\na reboot Superman film planned to be released some time in 2013, will now have a\nspecial guest star in the form of The Green\nLantern. Just how this character will fit\ninto the story of Clark Kent is not clear at\nthe moment, but we have reports that both\nHenry Cavill (Superman) and Ryan Reynolds\n(The Green Lantern) are more than ecstatic\nabout the news.\n\u201cWill they hook up? I have no idea.\nThat part of the script is being completed as we speak\u201d said the recently engaged Cavill. \u201cI mean, it will\ndefinitely be an interesting twist.

She,\nher boyfriend Robert Pattinson\nand Taylor Lautner wowed the\naudience with spectacular nev-er-before-heard exclusive preview information on their hotly\nanticipated upcoming movie,\nBreaking Dawn: Part 2.\n\u201cWe decided this time\u201d moaned\nStewart, \u201cnot to follow the\nbook, like, at all. I know how\ndisappointed you all were so\nthe director [Bill Condon] and\nthe three of us took matters into\nour own hands. We decided to\nvamp it up a notch.\u201d The crowd\nbroke into laughter at that joke.\n\u201cWe wanted to give you something complex and thought-provoking.\u201d\nThey followed\non with spoilers including\nhow Jacob\u2019s\nimprinting on\nEdward and\nBella\u2019s vampire daughter actually\nleads to the\nwerewolf\u2019s\nuncontrollable sexual hunger and frenzy.\n\u201cVery exciting stuff, we\u2019ll actually get to see Taylor act in this\none.

All I have to do is to channel\nwhatever I felt when I saw Rob\ngetting down and dirty with\nKristen. And trust me, there\u2019s\nbeen a lot of that on the set. So\nI think I can manage.\u201d\nContinuing on with the suck-up\nroutine, Stewart added \u201clook, I\nknow you guys felt nothing with\nthat lame sex scene Robert and\nI had, but just you wait until you\nsee Taylor get it on with my\ngrown-up vampire child. Now\nwe\u2019re talking! That\u2019s what teen\ndramas are all about right? Hot\nanimalistic sex.
