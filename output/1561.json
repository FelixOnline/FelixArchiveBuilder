Matthew McConaughey lost 50 pounds for the role,\nwhich explains his gaunt figure, but\nit\u2019s in his raw, vulnerable and inspiring\nperformance that the film truly comes\nto life despite its bleak subject mat-ter. McConaughey\u2019s versatility knows\nno bounds, and given his Magic Mike\nsnub last year, he deserves a spot here.\nLeonardo DiCaprio (The Wolf of\nWall Street)\nIt\u2019s a surprise to many that Leonardo\nDiCaprio has never won an Oscar. He\nhas been consistently unlucky with his\nnominations, always forced to face off\nagainst difficult opponents. So will\nthis finally be his year of glory? Working in his favour is the fact that he\u2019s under the direction of Martin Scorsese,\nand that the studio has enough faith in\nthe film for a Christmas Day release.\nBut once again there are some acting heavyweights vying for the always\ncompetitive Best Actor category. He\nmay have to sit out for another year.\nBruce Dern (Nebraska)\nThis year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival\u2019s Best\nActor winner, Bruce Dern stars in Alexander Payne\u2019s new black-and-white\nfamily roadtrip drama that is as hilarious as it is heartwarming. Although\nstarting off as a grumpy, deluded man\nwith a dream of collecting his million\ndollars just by turning up to a scam\nagency, it turns out Woody Grant\n(Dern) has so many more stories to\ntell than that, which is why Nebraska\nis one of this year\u2019s best films, with\nDern in a pivotal role that sees him\nlargely cold and distant, although with\nthe right amount of warmth.\nMichael B. Jordan (Fruitvale Station)\nThe Academy likes to pay attention\nto at least one independent film each\nyear (perhaps to show off their focus on variety) and if there is ever a\nfilm to get into the mix this year, it\u2019s\n2013\u2019s Sundance hit, the based-on-a-true-story account of the shooting of\nOscar Grant. Jordan is set to scoop up\nsome newcomer awards (he has done\nso already with the Hollywood Film\nAwards), but is he ready to play at the\nhighest of the levels with this year\u2019s\ncompetition? It\u2019s unlikely for sure,\nbut if all the love for the film sticks\naround, there could be a chance.\nIdris Elba (Mandela: Long Walk to\nFreedom)\nHand-picked by Barack Obama to\nscreen at the White House, this Nelson Mandela biopic has awards glory\nwritten all over it. The critics are already raving about Elba\u2019s outstanding\nperformance as the President of South\nAfrica. Plus, Elba has been growing\nin popularity thanks to his successful\nstints on television with shows like\nThe Wire and Luther. He has been\nmaking the transition from TV to film\nover the years (Thor, Pacific Rim) but\nthis is setting out to be the biggest\ncritical hit of his career yet.\nOscar Isaac (Inside Llewyn Davis)\nSinging always goes down well when\nit comes to attracting award attention (just look at the guy to the left)\nalthough how the Academy will react\nto folk music is left to be seen. But\nregardless of music taste, the Coen\nbrothers\u2019 tragi-comedy works because\nof a likable central character. There\nis something heartbreaking about\nwitnessing something that will never\nbe, as we follow Llewyn (Oscar Isaac)\nstruggling to catch a break in the music industry. His incredible singing\nthat makes you fall in love with an\nentire genre of music should help too.\nJoaquin Phoenix (Her)\nHis rather chequered relationship\nwith the Academy (calling the awards\n\u2018bullshit\u2019 is never a way to go when it\ncomes to winning favours) isn\u2019t going\nto win him any fans, but this quirky\nromantic comedy in which Joaquin\nPhoenix\u2019s character falls in love with a\nvirtual machine\u2019s voice (much sweeter\nand more touching than it actually\nsounds) may just be unique enough\nto catch the Academy\u2019s attention. It\u2019s\na fascinating concept, with a talented\nenough actor to sell the story with\nsensitive exploration of an highly unusual character.\nChristian Bale (Out of the Furnace)\nHis performance here has been described as his \u2018greatest performance\u2019,\nwhich is really saying something for an\nactor who has consistently delivered in\noutstanding roles time and time again\nover his long-standing career. When it\ncomes to dedicated intensity, no one\ndoes it better than Bale. With a Best\nSupporting Actor Award (The Fighter)\nalready under his belt, has time come\nfor him to conquer the other category as well? This may not be a biopic\nor based on a best-selling novel, but\ngiven the early mixed reviews, Bale\u2019s\nperformance is praised most.\nJosh Brolin (Oldboy)\nThe much-anticipated American remake of Chan-wook Park\u2019s Oldboy\n(that no one actually wanted in the\nfirst place) hits the screens in 2013\n(a decade after the original\u2019s release).\nWill Smith was once worryingly set to\nstar in the new version, although it\u2019s\ngood to see someone of Josh Brolin\u2019s\nscruffy bad-boy killer intensity took\nover instead. The Motion Picture\nAssociation of America highlights\n\u201cstrong brutal violence, disturbing\nimages, some graphic sexuality and\nnudity, and language\u201d which could potentially act as a deterrent.\nHugh Jackman (Prisoners)\nHugh Jackman has truly outdone\nhimself following on from his Oscarnominated role in Les Mis\u00e9rables. As\na grieving, desperate father who will\nstop at nothing to find his kidnapped\ndaughter, Jackman goes to incredibly\ndark places, using morally questionable methods to get to the disturbing\ntruth. His slow transformation from\na loving, caring family man to something more sinister and monstrous is\none captured stunningly well by Jackman whose role will no doubt spark\ndebates among cinema-goers. It\u2019s a\nwell-layered, haunting performance.\n\n"

Most measurement\nmethods require direct absorption, or\nare in some other way destructive to\nthe nature of the particle. This means\nthat you have little time to glean all of\nthe information before it disappears,\nand there is no way to double check\nyour results. Now, if only there was a\nway around this.

Weird and wonderful things\nhappen in the quantum world, and if\nthere was a feasible way to measure\nphotons without destroying their\nnature, many new technologies, such\nas quantum computing, could gain\nfooting. A report by Andreas Reiserer,\nStephan Ritter and Gerhard Rempe\nin Science last week puts forward a\ndifferent method of measurement:\ninstead of detecting the photon as you\nwould a particle, by absorption, why\nnot detect it as a wave?\nOne thing waves are really good at\nis reflecting. Reflection causes a phase\nlag, interference and diffraction in\nthe photon-wave. The experiment set\nup by Reiserer\u2019s team consisted of an\noptical resonant chamber containing\na single atom, the walls of which were\nsuperconductive and thus highly\nreflective. A photon enters and will\nonly interact with the atom if it is in\nthe correct energy state, otherwise it\nwill reflect off the wall.\nHold on to your hats, because this is\nwhere is gets a little crazy. The atom\nenclosed in the chamber is prepared\nin a superposition of allowed and\nforbidden states. The photon-wave\nenters and due to the forbidden state,\nis reflected. However, the atom will\nchange as if it had interacted with the\nphoton, because it is in an allowed\nstate. The result is that it appears there\nwas an interaction, but the photon still\nexists! We have measured the presence\nof a photon without destroying it.\nThe team repeated their\nexperiments, showing the same\nphoton could be repeatedly detected\nwithout being absorbed. Individual\nPavitar Singh Devgon\nScience Writer\nMars MAVEN mission launches\nThis week the latest US mission to\nMars launched successfully; NASA\ncalled the launch \u201cflawless\u201d. The\nrocket carrying the Mars Atmosphere\nand Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)\nspacecraft left the Earth on Monday\nfrom Cape Canaveral Air Force Station\nin Florida, the site of many previous\nNASA mission launches. Just under\nan hour after launch the probe was\nreleased from the rocket, deployed its\nsolar panels and oriented into cruise\nconfiguration.\n\u201cEverything looks good. The signals\nare coming in fine, and so far the\nsystems that are on are reporting back\ngreat. We\u2019re heading out to the Red\nPlanet,\u201d said David Mitchell, Nasa\u2019s\nMAVEN project manager.\nThe MAVEN mission will be\ninvestigating the upper atmosphere\nand the ionosphere of Mars alongside\nthe solar wind, with the intention\nof providing insight into the history\nof the Martian atmosphere, climate\nand the planet\u2019s habitability. After\na journey of over 440 million miles\nand lasting 10 months, MAVEN will\nreach Mars and will need to undergo\na check-out period before finally\nbeginning its primary data collection\nmission. This mission is scheduled to\nlast for one year, but NASA intends\nto keep MAVEN operational well\ninto the future to provide a data-relay\nplatform for surface explorers such as\nthe Curiosity Rover.\nMAVEN is equipped with eight\ndata-collection sensors to determine\nthe characteristics of the upper\natmosphere and the solar wind.\nThe instruments were designed and\ncontributed by NASA\u2019s Goddard\nSpace Flight Centre, the University of\nColorado, Boulder, and the University\nof California, Berkeley. The Centre\nd\u2019Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements\nin France also provided the sensor for\none instrument.\nBy exploring the composition of\nMars\u2019 upper atmosphere and the\nimpact that the solar wind has on\nthe atmosphere, lead investigator Dr\nBruce Jakosky from the University of\nColorado hopes to understand how\nMars went from a wet planet with a\ndense atmosphere billions of years ago\nto its present arid state.\n\u201cThe loss rates [of the atmosphere\ndue to the solar wind] today are\nlow enough that we\u2019re probably not\ngoing to see the loss of the entire\natmosphere,\u201d says Dr Jakosky. \u201cThe\nreason we are studying it today, even\nthough the loss rates are so much\nlower, is that we can understand the\nspecific processes that are going on\nand learn how to extrapolate them\nback in time.\u201d\nphotons were able to be detected\nwith a 77% success rate, while close\nto 66% of the photons would survive\nreflection. This was enough to prove\ntheir non-destructive measurement\nmethod. Though it may take a while\nto refine the process, this is sure to\nprove effective in quantum optics,\ncomputing and entanglement.\nNASA\n\n"

It was\nfound that GPA scores of the \u2018night\nowls\u2019 were significantly lower than\ntheir classmates who had earlier bed-times. In addition, sleeping late during\nsummer holidays had an impact on\nthe emotional well-being of these\nindividuals.\nSo, why do so many teens stay up\nlate?Itappearsthatanumberoffactors\naffect this behaviour.

The researchers\nhypothesized that adolescents have\nsomething called an \u2018evening circadian\npreference\u2019, which gives them a desire\nto work later at night.\nIn addition, another factor identified\nwhich keeps teenagers up so late is the\nincreasing use of various electronic\ngadgets at younger ages. Studies\nindicate that bright lights from\nlaptop screens and smart-phones\nlead to a reduction of melatonin, a\nkey hormone involved in sleep cycle\nregulation.\nFinally, the study also suggests that\npoor parental monitoring could also\nlead to teens staying up late.\nThis is not the first study to have\nbeen published linking sleep with\nperformance, thus it only reinforces\nthat it is increasingly becoming a\ncommon problem in young adults.\nRegular sleep deprivation can have\na great impact on the health of an\nindividual; therefore this issue should\nnot be taken so lightly. Most of you\nmay think that this is irrelevant since\nwe have already passed our adolescent\nstage.\nBut don\u2019t forget that we ourselves\ncould become parents one day, and it\nwould be our responsibility to ensure\nand motivate our children to follow a\nregular early bed time to help them\nperform better academically and\nemotionally.\nSynthetic alcohol does this\nPhilippa Skett\nScience Editor\nF\nor those reading this\nhungover in bed after that\n\u201cquick pint\u201d on a Thursday\nevening turned into a\nfree for all, we have good\nnews. It seems that our very own\nProfessor Nutt, previous government\nadvisor and keen advocate of drug\nlegalisation, has finally identified\ncandidate molecules that can imitate\nall the good parts of drinking, without\nthat dreaded feeling the next day. The\nmolecule can hopefully reproduce\nthe pleasurable effects of alcohol, but,\nwith a lower toxicity, may keep the\nhangovers and health risks associated\nwith drinking at bay.\nAlcohol acts as a depressant on\nthe central nervous system, and a\nmultitudeofreceptors,includingthose\nthat respond to the neurotransmitter\nGABA, can be modulated in activity\nby ethanol. GABA acts as an inhibitory\nmolecule in vertebrates when binding\nto transmembrane receptors on the\nneurons of the brain, which in turn\neffects the transmission of nerve\nimpulses and can result in feeling\nmore relaxed or unfazed.\nEthanol is rather cavalier in its\nactions, however; it targets a lot\nof other cellular receptors non-specifically too, so has a large number\nof routes in which it can modulate its\neffects. Being able to pinpoint those\ninteractions that deliver the desirable\neffects of ethanol consumption is key,\nand it may be that GABA is the answer.\nThis alcohol substitute would target\nGABA receptors very specifically to\nensure the positive effects alcohol\ncan have are sustained whilst the\nundesirable side effects are reduced.\nThese include the immediate effects\nsuch as loss of co-ordination,\naggression and memory loss, but also\nthe after effects, such as the hangover\nyou may indeed be suffering right now.\nIt seems too good to be true, right?\nIt seems that Professor Nutt is still\ndiscussing his top secret synthetic\nalcohol substitute use with investors,\nbut is worried that the drug may\nbe legislated too heavily by the\ngovernment. This is somewhat\nof a touchy issue that has caused\ncontroversy concerning Nutt in the\npast, with his recent paper in Nature\nthis year urging the government\nto weaken the current legislation\nsurrounding psychotics falling on deaf\nears.\nAlthough the alteration of legislation\nsurrounding drugs such as MDMA\nand marijuana is an understandably\nmore complex and controversial issue,\nhopefully such complications will not\nsurround the possible legislation of\nthis new synthetic alcohol substitute\nif the benefits discussed are a tangible\nreality.\nTherefore it seems we can only sit\nand wait for the holy grail of student\nsatisfaction for now. Unfortunately,\nfor those that are still mulling over last\nnight\u2019s antics whilst hiding away from\nthe world, this solution isn\u2019t going to\nbe getting you to your 9am lectures in\ntime today. Right now, it just might be\nbetter to get some toast and tea and\nfight off that hangover the traditional\nway.\nPHARMAMAB.IT\n\n"

As such, I went into the theatre\nwith mixed expectations. However,\nthe initial signs were promising; I\nhad high hopes when the preliminary\nmobile phone announcement was\ndone using P.G. Wodehouse quotes.\nMy expectations were more than\nmet. Every conversation of this play\nelicited laughs and the script never\nlost sight of its source material. I\nwas particularly delighted to see that\nWodehouse\u2019s description of Spode\nhad been included \u2013 \u201ca big chap with\na small moustache and the sort of eye\nthat can open an oyster at sixty paces\u201d.\nPerfect Nonsense is an adaptation of\nthe novel The Code of the Woosters.\nIt\u2019s one of the best known P.G.\nWodehouse books, partly due to its\ntelevision adaptation (the one with\nthe cow-creamer), and the play sticks\nremarkably closely to the book except\nin one way; here the premise is that\nBertie is putting on a play about his\nrecent weekend at Totleigh Towers,\nwhere the original story takes place.\nEssentially, it is a play withwin a play.\nThis twist works very well, and\nprovides ample opportunities for\nmore humour to be injected. He\nenlists Jeeves and his Aunt Dahlia\u2019s\nbutler Seppings as the two other\nmembers of his cast, and the two\nbutlers, as well as playing themselves,\nimpersonate all the other characters\nin the play. It gets sillier and sillier\n(not least when Seppings tries to\nplay the formidable Roderick Spode),\nculminating in Jeeves playing both\nparties of a conversation, leaping\nback and forth across the stage.\nThe one downside of this was that\nsome of the characters seemed flatter\nthan they could have \u2013 Spode, for\nexample, lost all sense of menace. On\nthe other hand, Stephen Mangan\u2019s\nperformance as Bertie was the star\nof the show. The way he interacted\nwith the audience (despite Jeeves\u2019\ndisapproval) had the whole crowd\nroaring with laughter, and the feeling\nWhat: Jeeves & Wooster in\n\u201cPerfect Nonsense\u201d\nWhere: Duke of York\u2019s Theatre,\nLeicester Square, WC2\nWhen: Until 8th March 2014\nPrice: \u00a315 - \u00a380\nthat Bertie was actually improvising\nthe whole thing was convincing.\nMatthew Macfayden was also\nimpressive as Jeeves, managing to\nremain superbly aloof throughout all\nhis gags. His other roles are equally\npolished, from Stiffy Byng to Sir\nWatkyn Basset.\nOne other minor quibble is that\nnot all of the humour reached such a\nhigh standard. As well as the original\njokes from Wodehouse\u2019s writing,\nand the humour stemming from\nBertie\u2019s endearing inexperience and\nineptness at acting, there are other\nfar clumsier gags. Butterfield, the\nbutler at Totleigh Towers, seems to\nbe in the play for the sole purpose of\nthanking anyone who asks him to do\nsomething. This is a joke that is, the\nfirst time, only mildly funny. By the\nend it had definitely started to grate.\nThankfully, however, these jokes\nmake up but a small proportion of the\nplay.\nOverall the show lived up to its\nname, but not always for quite the\nright reasons. Casual Wodehouse\nfans, or those who have only seen Fry\nand Laurie\u2019s TV show, will love this\nfarce for its imaginative silliness, but\nmore die-hard Wodehousians will\nmiss the cleverness and subtlety of\nthe master of comedy\u2019s sublime wit.\nDAVID JENSEN\nMojo in Soho, getting jazzy\nMario Lepore\nWriter\nNPtKP\u0001\nNoun\nA magic charm, talisman, or spell.\nMagic Power.\nThe long awaited revival of Jez\nButterworth\u2019s play Mojo opened on the\n13th November, and saw Rupert Grint\nmaking his professional theatre debut.\nPremiering in the Royal Court Theatre\nin 1995, Mojo was the recipient of the\n1996 Laurence Olivier Award for Best\nNew Comedy, with a film adaptation\nreleased in 1997.\nBased in the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll Soho scene\nof the 1950s, this black comedy is set\nentirely within the seedy \u2018Atlantic\u2019\nnightclub. Silver Johnny (Tom Rhys\nWhat: Mojo\nWhere: Harold Pinter Theatre,\nLeicester Square, SW1\nWhen: Until 25th Jan 2014\nPrice: \u00a310 - \u00a385\nHarries) \u2013 a young and talented\nperformer \u2013 has the potential to go\nfar. However his jealous manager, the\nnightclub owner Ezra, tries to protect\nhim from the advances of another local\ngangster, Sam Ross. After Ezra\u2019s body\nis found sawn in half and deposited in\nseparate dustbins, it is left to the rest\nof the group to resolve the situation,\nand the nightclub in which they\npreviously dreamed of success turns\ninto an isolated prison.\nFeaturing a phenomenal cast, it\nis at first strange to watch the valet\nfrom Downton (Brendan Coyle), Ron\nWeasley (Rupert Grint), 007\u2019s Q (Ben\nWhishaw), Merlin (Colin Morgan)\nand Made in Dagenham\u2019s Daniel Mays\nalongside one another as pill-popping,\nwannabee big-shot gangsters, together\nwith newcomer Harries. The play is\nnon-apologetic for its all-male cast,\nSIMON ANNAND\nand deals with themes of masculinity\nand the fight for supremacy.\nAlthough it is hard to erase the\nmemory of Grint as Ron Weasley, his\nperformance as Sweets the nervous\nsidekick is strong, with skilful comic\ntiming. There are several well-written\nduologues between Grint and Mays\nthat had the audience laughing\nout loud. Mays certainly conjures\nthe most comic effect with his\nChaplinesque persona and animated\nactions. The language used is not for\nthe faint hearted, with the \u2018C-bomb\u2019\nbeing dropped fairly regularly, and\ncertainly accounts for the parental\nadvisory that comes with the tickets.\nCoyle commands great stage presence\nas Mickey, however is occasionally let\ndown by his cockney accent, which\nhas a hint of Downton lingering at\ntimes.\nThe Second Act is certainly more\npowerful than the first; containing\na death scene more realistic than\nany I have ever witnessed, movie\nor otherwise. Tension significantly\nclimaxes towards the end and makes\nup for the somewhat slow opening\nof the play. The show was stolen\nby Whishaw, who\u2019s psychotic and\narrogant nature quickly turns lighthearted conversation into something\nmore sinister. Recognition must also\nbe given to the staging and lighting\ndesign:youarecompletelytransported\ninto this dingy Soho club along with\nits muggy air and stale alcohol.\nOverall this is a playful yet dark\nperformance that is powered by the\nstrength of its cast. What it lacks in\npace is made up for in the script and\ncertainly allows for an impressive and\nentertaining evening out.\nSIMON ANNAND\n\n"

    "content": "24 FRIDAY 22 NOV\nFILM Editor: John Park\nThe comic success of Don Jon\nJack Steadman\nStar Writer\nDon Jon\nDirector: Joseph Gordon-Levitt\nWriter: Joseph Gordon-Levitt\nStarring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt,\nScarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore\nRuntime: 90 minutes\nCertification: 18\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt\u2019s directorial\ndebut (which he also wrote and stars in\n\u2013 the classic triple threat) opens with\na rather unsubtle montage that flicks\nbetween credits and the standard\nexamples of society\u2019s objectification\nof women. It makes a rather obvious\npoint \u2013 objectification is everywhere\n\u2013 but the complete absence of context\nsets the initial tone of the film in a noman\u2019s-land of taste: is this just another\nfilm that uses objectification as part\nof its draw, or is this one that openly\nrips into and lays bare the misogyny\nbehind that objectification? (I\u2019m going\nto spoil things for you here, because\nif I don\u2019t, it completely derails the\nreview, and tell you this is very much\nthe latter. Obviously.)\nFrom the title card comes a\nsequence that is almost instantly the\nperfect example of TMI (Too Much\nInformation for you acronym-o-phobes) as \u2018Don\u2019 Jon (Gordon-Levitt)\ndetails his, ah, \u2018me time\u2019 routine.\nExplicitly detailed. With clips from\nthe porn and everything. And then,\njust when you think Don Jon might\nfinally have found the limit of the\ndetail it\u2019s prepared to go into, it goes\nfurther, and just keeps going. It\u2019s an\nincredibly confident (and bold) film\nfor a debut director \u2013 and it works all\nthe better for it. A more nervous hand\ncould have sunk this film, instead the\nassured direction and script ensure it\nstays afloat, confident in the comedy\nand story being good enough to get\npast the initial awkwardness.\nFortunately (oh, so fortunately),\nboth of them are more than good\nenough \u2013 the comedy is spot-on,\ngetting laughs from both the insanely\nsmart script and its brutal realism. In a\nfilm that opens the way Don Jon does,\nit\u2019s perfectly acceptable for people to\ntalk the way people in real life actually\ntalk (shocking, isn\u2019t it, people talking\nlike people in a film), with quickfire\nexchanges and inane banter (mostly\ninvolving Jon & Co\u2019s \u2018scoring\u2019 \u2013\nliterally, not in the euphemistic sense\nyou foul-minded slob, although they\ndo that too \u2013 of women at the bar)\nkeeping the laughter fairly constant.\nThe family comedy is a treat, from\nTony Danza\u2019s admiring of Jon\u2019s new\ngirlfriend (which got perhaps the\nbiggest laughs of the night) to Brie\nLarson\u2019s deadpan expressions (with\nLarson walking off with the film\u2019s\nhighest laughs-to-lines ratio: one\nline to many, many laughs). Julianne\nMoore\u2019s introductory monologue is\nequally delightful (and by delightful\nI mean hilariously awkward and off-the-wall \u2013 I have a weird definition\nof \u2018delightful\u2019 it seems), and the in-car\nskits are perhaps the film\u2019s highlight;\nten 20-second shots that perfectly\nencapsulate Jon at that point in time.\nIt seems a little excessive to continue\nraving about the comedy quality of\nDon Jon, but it\u2019s easily its strongest\nasset, as the script skewers absolutely\neverything it can lay its hands\non, from the obvious \u2013 misogyny,\nobjectification, porn, gender norms\n(there\u2019s a great argument about\n\u2018cleaning\u2019 in the film which is the\ncomplete opposite of what you\nexpect and therefore perfect) \u2013 to\nthe unexpected \u2013 TiVo, the Church,\nadvertisements, Facebook. You name\nit, it\u2019s probably getting fun poked at it.\nEven films. Especially films. Hell, Don\nJon pokes fun at itself. And that\u2019s why\nit\u2019s so good.\nWell, it\u2019s not the only reason. The\nperfect performances play a significant\npart in that as well \u2013 everyone is on\ntop form here, from Larson with\nher one line to Gordon-Levitt and\nScarlett Johansson (amazing, as ever)\nwith their many. The great use of\nrecurring imagery (trips to the gym,\nthe car skits, confessions \u2013 half the\nfilm consists of variations on the same\nten or so scenes, and yet it works), the\nsolid editing and the constant sense\nof discomfort all combine to produce\none hell of a film. It\u2019s not perfect, by\nany means, but then as the film tries\nso hard to point out \u2013 nothing, and\nnobody is. Not sex, not relationships,\nnot movie-making. But at least Don\nJon comes close.\nCan Fassbender handle the truth?\nJack Steadman\nStar Writer\nThe Counsellor\nDirector: Ridley Scott\nWriter: Cormac McCarthy\nStarring: Michael Fassbender,\nPen\u00e9lope Cruz, Javier Bardem,\nCameron Diaz, Brad Pitt\nRuntime: 117 minutes\nCertification: 18\nOn paper, The Counsellor should be\nperfect. Cormac McCarthy\u2019s first\noriginal screenplay (a few of his\nother books have been adapted into\nscreenplays \u2013 notably No Country for\nOld Men and The Road), directed by\nRidley Scott, the genius behind Alien\nand the man with such a passion for\nMcCarthy\u2019s work he\u2019s been trying\nto work out how to film Blood\nMeridian for years. Plus a heavy-hitter\ncast featuring the likes of Michael\nFassbender at the point where his\ncareer seems utterly unstoppable,\nJavier Bardem after his scene-stealing\nturn in Skyfall, Brad Pitt following\non from holding up the entire film of\nWorld War Z and both Cameron Diaz\nand Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, amongst many,\nmany others. What could go wrong?\nObviously, the immediate answer\nto that question is: absolutely\neverything. Fortunately, that\u2019s not\nquite the case here, but The Counsellor\nis an extremely complicated beast.\nMcCarthy\u2019s script is a real treat in\nterms of the spoken word, delivering\nsome exquisite monologues that just\nwouldn\u2019t exist in any other film, but it\ndoes make the film incredibly heavy on\ntalking heads \u2013 there are a few pulse-pounding moments of action, but on\nthe whole it\u2019s a film that requires a lot\nof investment in the characters for,\nultimately, no reward. In traditional\nMcCarthy style, The Counsellor is\nunrelentingly bleak, offering a flicker\nof (false) hope at the beginning with\na proposal before rapidly spinning off\ninto an uncontrollable descent into\nhell for the eponymous counsellor.\nThere is no innocence, no hope, no\nredeemable features left in the world of\nThe Counsellor, and the final cut leaves\na film with no closure. It\u2019s horrifying\n\u2013 and on one hand it\u2019s a move that\nleaves the film feeling unfinished,\nbut on the other, it couldn\u2019t end any\nother way. This is not a film that was\nmeant to have a happy ending, and\nto give closure (other than the deaths\nof various characters) would be to\nundermine the preceding two hours.\nWith such a dialogue-heavy film,\nmuch depends on the actors to\ndeliver the goods and make it all\nengaging (and believable \u2013 how\nmany monologues do you encounter\nin the real world?). With the names\nThe Counsellor has on board, there\nwas never any doubt they\u2019d manage\nit. Fassbender is endlessly watchable,\nBardem is absurdly sleazy (proving his\nincredible versatility, from the silent\nandthreateningassassininNoCountry\nto the evil mastermind in Skyfall\nto this utter sleaze-bag), Diaz is an\nenigma wrapped in a riddle, wrapped\nin a question (to paraphrase someone\nmore intelligent), Pitt is charming\nand Cruz does an incredible job with\na very limited part. There are flashes\nof black humour through the endless\ndarkness, and the cast handle it well,\nrolling off the fantastically verbose\ndialogue like nobody\u2019s business.\nDespite the stunning script, the\nassured acting, and the delightful\ndirecting (Scott\u2019s as on-form as he\u2019s\never been \u2013 with a script that\u2019s less of\na horrifying mess than Prometheus,\nhe has plenty of chances to show off)\nit\u2019s still hard to conclusively like The\nCounsellor. It\u2019s a long slog through a\ntwo hour run-time, and the resulting\nfeeling of emptiness and shock that\nit leaves is not the best way to leave a\ncinema.\nThe very fact it can have that effect\nspeaks volumes.\nROGEREBERT.COM\nWWW.PATHEOS.COM CHELEBELLESLAIR.TUMBLR.COM\n\n"

The\nfirst time I aired my opinions about\nmy plans for a new social platform to\nclose friends and family, admittedly\nI was met with a few nervous\nsmiles and pats on the shoulder.\n\u201cDo you really think you can\ncompete with Facebook at your age?\u201d\na few of my more blunt mates laughed.\nBut that\u2019s not what I had in mind.\nThe platform I created \u2013 Unii.com\n\u2013 wasn\u2019t born to compete directly\nwith the big players like Facebook or\nTwitter, and neither was it designed to\ntake users away from them. Instead,\nthe platform offers students the chance\nto meet like-minded friends on their\ncourse, at their university or in their\naccommodation \u2013 all before they leave\nhome in September. When arriving on\ncampus, students can then use Unii.\ncom for every part of their student life:\nby either meeting and socialising with\nfriends within the university network;\njoining and managing societies\nthrough our unique platform; or\neven finding a job placement\nthrough the dedicated jobsboard.\nWith younger audiences already\ndwindling on Facebook, it was evident\nto me that there was a hunger for a\nplatform that clearly appreciated its\nWhat happens at uni...stays at Unii.com\nIn 2011, Marco Nardone graduated\nwith a degree in Physics from Imperial\nCollege. In just two years, the 25-year-Marco Nardone\ntarget market\u2019s exact needs and kept\nthem at the core of any development.\nFor Unii.com, this niche market\nwas made possible by ensuring only\nthose with a university-accredited\nemail address can sign in \u2013 finally\nputting an end to those snooping\nparents flicking through your photos\nor future employers digging around\npast antics you\u2019d rather forget about!\nBut before this social start-up\njourney had even begun, it was vital\nI spent a lot of time (and patience!)\nfiguring out the student market that\nUnii.com targeted. This involved\nunderstanding what students would\nfind useful, which features would be\ndesirable and the importance of a\nclosed social environment. Being a\nrecent student myself, it would have\nbeen easy to just use my gut instinct to\ncraftsomethingIwouldlikepersonally.\nBut Unii.com is about catering for all\nstudents across the entire UK, and I\nknew to become a successful start-up,\nI had to listen to the current market.\nHolding research focus groups and\nlistening to user feedback in the early\nstagesoflaunchhashelpedUnii.comto\ngrow rapidly, seeing a massive 100,000\nstudents sign up in just six months.\nWe continue to listen to these users\nand have just revolutionised the user\nexperience on the platform \u2013 a direct\naction taken from our user feedback.\nWith the continued popularity of\nUnii.com, some people do question\nhow I went from the world of science\nto the realms of social media. But\nhaving a Physics degree at Imperial\nCollege provided me with skills that\nhave helped guide me through my\njourney as an entrepreneur and CEO,\nin some really unexpected ways.\nThe four years at university not only\ntaught me to think logically and be\nthorough, but above all \u2013 never give\nup! Physics was a degree that involves\nperseverance, time, and of course,\nlots of studying. Unii.com wouldn\u2019t\nbe where it is today if either my team\nor I had given up at the first hurdle\nand it was these skills that helped\nkeep me grounded in the beginning.\nFor students out there considering\ndiving into the start-up world or\nthe social media industry, that\nwise old saying \u201cNever put off until\ntomorrow what you can do today\u201d\nspeaks volumes. It was this kind\nof thinking that led to the success\nof Unii.com \u2013 I saw a gap in the\nmarket, yet I didn\u2019t wait until I was\nolder or watch someone else swoop\nin and create an alternative website.\nThe future of Unii.com is looking\nbright, as we look to tip 200,000\nusers by 2014. I can understand why\nthere were some doubts \u2013 as a young\ngraduate entrepreneur, any industry\nbreakout is going to be tough \u2013 but\nby understanding the gap in the\nmarket for something fresh, and\nresearching the target market inside\nout, it\u2019s proven to be a success and\nI encourage any Imperial College\nstudent to follow in these footsteps.\nJoin the\nFelix\nBusiness\nTeam\nToday!\nSend an email\nto:\nfelix.business@\nimperial.ac.uk\nWriter\n\n"

    "content": "34 FRIDAY 22 NOV\nCLUBS & SOCS Editor: Nida Mahmud\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nChristmas is Coming\nBen Fernando\nCharity Editor\nI\nt\u2019s that time of year again \u2013 Christmas! Once again\nthe hordes of charity appeals are descending upon us,\nall asking for our help. But other than giving away our\nChristmas money (which I\u2019m hoping to talk about\nnext week), what can you and I do to help? There\u2019re\na number of ways that our time can be put to good use.\nI\u2019ve not put a huge number of links in this article, but if\nyou\u2019re interested a quick Google search with the name of\nyour area and what you\u2019d like to do will probably lead to\nsome contacts. Otherwise, www.volunteernow.co.uk has a\npretty neat interactive search function that might help you\nnarrow down what you want to do.\nThe first, and perhaps most common volunteering activity over Christmas is helping the homeless. Over the winter period the low temperatures and higher incidence of\ninfectious diseases means that the death rate amongst\nthe homeless noticeably increases, and obviously charities work to try and combat this problem. Crisis, a leading homelessness charity, runs several temporary shelters\nover Christmas in various cities: www.crisis.org.uk.\nYou could also think about volunteering to help vulnerable people who aren\u2019t necessarily homeless. Christmas\ntends to be a time when organisations are short on staff\nbut the demand is nonetheless high \u2013 consider a helpline\nlike Samaritans, or perhaps an old people\u2019s home. These\noften run small Christmas parties or events that require\nhelp from people who aren\u2019t specially trained, but who are\nenthusiastic and willing to pitch in.\nIf you\u2019d like something a bit less front-line, you could think\nabout helping out for a couple of hours at a local foodbank,\nor promoting present recycling. The former involves taking donations of unused food, like tins and cereals, and\npackaging and distributing them to people who need\nthem. Again, Christmas often sees the problem of food\npoverty highlighted, as people spend more on their heating and can\u2019t afford to eat. What\u2019s more worrying is that\nthe incidence of food bank usage is actually going up in the\nUK, something which I find rather shocking.\nPresent recycling promotes the use of Christmas presents that we would otherwise throw away or stick in a\ncupboard somewhere. Charity shops will always be really\nkeen to get their hands on unwanted presents which can\ngo a long way to making up their takings in January, which\noften sees a decline in sales for shops. If you get a new\nlaptop or something, you could also consider recycling the\nold one, though an organisation like Computer Aid (www.\ncomputeraid.org).\nFinally, one thing which those of us who grew up in the\nUK will remember is the Christmas Fayre/Fair/Market/\nChurch Fair/event, which always has a charity presence. If\nyou\u2019d like a slightly more chilled volunteering opportunity,\nyou could find out which charity is going to be at any of\nyour local events and volunteer to help out: be it selling\nmerchandise, helping on the door or whatever. I\u2019ve been to\nloads of these and they\u2019re generally good fun, you\u2019ll likely\nget a cup of tea and a biscuit for your trouble as well.\nSo there\u2019s a few ideas, a list that\u2019s by no means exhaustive.\nWhilst we all of course have our own ideas of what we\u2019d\nlike to do in terms of relaxing and working over Christmas,\neven a couple of hours that you spend helping out can go\na long way to making a big difference in the community.\nBen\nIC Radio Schedule\nDon\u2019t miss a treat!!\nI\nf you\u2019ve never seen Imperial\nCollege Symphony Orchestra\nplay, you\u2019re missing out!

    "content": "6 FRIDAY 22 NOV\nWELLBEING\nI\nwas diagnosed with clinical depression\nwhen I was 17. For me, the diagnosis\nhelped. It helped to give a name to the\nbizarre way that I had been feeling for\noverayear.Iwasalwaystiredandalways\nsad. The worst feeling was that of isolation,\nand feeling disjointed from the world, and I\nfelt like I was the only person in the world to\nfeel this way. I didn\u2019t tell anybody because I\nthought it might go away. I was scared of how\nI was feeling; I knew something was wrong,\nbut I didn\u2019t know what to do about it and I\ndidn\u2019t want to make a fuss. When I finally got\nmy diagnosis, I was given a legitimate reason\nto feel the way I did.\nDepression has affected every aspect\nof my life, and its symptoms can be quite\noverwhelming. Some days I wake up and feel\nempty. I don\u2019t want to do anything. I don\u2019t\nwant to work, I don\u2019t want to watch TV, and\nI certainly don\u2019t want to talk to anyone. For\nme, one of the worst parts of depression\nwas a sense of losing myself. I lost interest\nin things that I previously loved, like dancing\nand singing. I was in the choir but stopped\ngoing because I was too depressed. I lost my\npassion for biology, a subject I had previously\nloved, and my pride in my college work\ndisappeared. Depression also brought with it\na huge lack of self-confidence. I have always\nbeen a high achiever and a perfectionist, so\nI am constantly putting myself down when\nit comes to work. I\u2019m also quite shy in social\nsituations because I think that I have nothing\nto add to the conversation and that nobody\nwants me there. This can make hanging\nout with friends mentally exhausting. If\nsomeone was bullying you, constantly telling\nyou weren\u2019t good enough, that everybody\nhates you and there\u2019s no point to anything,\nyou would walk away. You can\u2019t walk away\nwhen that bully is inside your own head.\nTrying to explain depression to friends\nand family has been difficult. The most\ncommon reaction I\u2019ve faced is confusion,\nwith my friends saying that I don\u2019t look or\nact depressed. What some people don\u2019t\nunderstand about depression is its strength,\nand how it can completely consume\nsomebody\u2019s life, without anybody knowing.\nIt is surprisingly easy to hide. I got so good\nat putting up a front that I don\u2019t even realise\nI\u2019m doing it anymore. I have also had\nfriends offering advice on how to raise my\nmood, or who to turn to for help. Although\nI understand that they are just trying to\nhelp, when I want to talk, is it to get things\noff my chest, and all I want is someone to\nlisten to me. Offering advice can be a little\npatronising, despite the good intentions.\nThe most upsetting reaction I\u2019ve had is\nbeing called a drama queen. My depression\nis not something I have \u201cmade up\u201d, and I\ncannot control my symptoms. Because of\nthis negative reaction, I have become very\nreluctant to talk about my problems, and\ninstead deal with everything myself. Rather\nthan talking to someone, I have often turned\nto self harm to alleviate the stress, which\ncan manifest itself in many different ways.\nFor me, it is cutting, purging (making myself\nsick) and overdosing. I have also tried to\ntake my own life several times. I feel like\nthis is a common situation faced by those\nwith depression. Telling someone to \u201cpull\nthemselves together\u201d will only increase their\nsense of loneliness, and make them less likely\nto seek help.\nEverybody needs a support network to\nfall back on. That may be family, a close\nfriend, or a counsellor/psychiatrist. It\u2019s\ndifferent for each individual. There are many\ndifferent treatment options for depression:\ncounselling, cognitive behavioural therapy\n(CBT), medication, talking therapies, group\ntherapies and self-help, or a combination\nof these. Each individual will find that a\ndifferent type of treatment works best for\nthem. It may take some time to find the right\none. If I were to give advice to others seeking\nhelp, I would say be patient with the service,\nand with yourself. You may not feel better\nstraight away, and often \u201cit has to get worse\nbefore it gets better\u201d applies. Talking about\nyour feelings can be very difficult, especially\nif you\u2019re quite introverted like me. It can help,\nbut if that really isn\u2019t working, you could try\nwriting in a diary; anything to get how you\nfeel out, so that it\u2019s not building up inside\nof you. Even just hearing your thoughts out\nloud can be helpful, and something you were\nscared of suddenly doesn\u2019t seem so scary\nanymore. I found CBT and counselling\nextremely hard as I did not want to open up.\nI also found medication ineffectual. What\nworked for me was distracting myself when\nI got low, by hanging out with a close friend,\nwatching something good on TV, baking,\nsinging or even cleaning. Self-help is more\neffective for me personally, because I hate\ntalking to other people about my feelings.\nGetting a good night\u2019s sleep always helps\nalleviate my low mood and helps my energy\nlevels. I find that going for a jog or a swim\nduring the day helps me fall asleep more\neasily at night, and I also like to watch ASMR\n(autonomous sensory meridian response)\nvideos on Youtube.\nLooking to the future, I hope to keep\nmanaging my depression. Depression may be\nsomething that I have to live with for the rest\nof my life, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is going to\nrule my life. I may retry counselling and/or\nmedication, maybe when I\u2019m more mature\nand more ready to talk about my problems.\nUltimately, I want to have good mental\nhealth. To me, this doesn\u2019t mean being happy\nall the time, but rather equipping myself with\nthe tools I need to manage my thoughts,\nand accepting that there will always be bad\npatches, but they won\u2019t be forever and I will\ncome out the other side.\n-Anonymous\nIf you have any first-hand experiences with\ndepression and want to write an article in\nFelix for the OpenMinds campaign, please\nsend in your articles to Moeko at disoff@\nimperial.ac.uk. For further information\non how to get involved OpenMinds, email\nMoeko or visit our facebook page at www.\nfacebook.com/ICOpenMinds.\nI\nmperial, welcome to the OpenMinds campaign!\nOur aim is to increase understanding of mental\nhealth conditions and remove some of the stigma\nwith which they are associated.\n1 in 4 people suffer from a mental health\ncondition, yet there is a severe lack of awareness and\nthe subject is, too often, taboo. Those with a mental\nhealth condition can feel isolated and unsure of whom\nto turn to when, in reality, there are plenty of mental\nhealth services available. One of our objectives is to tell\nyou about the services that Imperial provides as well as\nthe external support on offer, that you might not have\nknown existed.\nMental health conditions include schizophrenia,\nanxiety, OCD, and eating disorders but depression is\nthe most common in the UK and is the focus of our\ncampaign. There is no single cause of depression,\nbut triggering factors can include: money worries,\npersonal relationships, loneliness, drug and alcohol\nabuse. It can also be hereditary. There are many\ndifferent types of depression, all of which are very real\nmedical conditions that require support.\nUni life can be stressful for anyone. Add this to\ndepression, and every day can be a struggle. Those who\ncan\u2019t cope might be told to \u201csuck it up\u201d or labelled as\n\u201cweak\u201d. This will only exacerbate the problem and cause\npeople to hide their problems out of embarrassment\nand shame. However, it isn\u2019t always easy on the other\nside of things. The lack of understanding of depression\nis astounding, considering how common it is. This\nis why we are campaigning to give you the facts on\ndepression, and debunk some of the myths, such as\n\u201cdepression is not a real medical illness\u201d.\nWe will have frequent articles here in the Felix, such\nas articles by health professionals, \u201cmyth-busters\u201d and\nsome of your first hand experiences (send them in to\nthe email below!), and we hope that as many of you as\npossible will participate in the survey we are releasing\nin the near future. The survey will include questions\nabout your understanding of mental health and the\nservices available, in order to get an idea of current\nattitudes towards mental health here at Imperial. In\nspring term we will be hosting an event with guest\nspeakers from various mental health organisations and\nmedical professionals. Look out for our posters around\ncampus! Our Facebook page is the place to keep up to\ndate with the campaign and to get involved!\nWe want you to get involved because mental health\nreally does affect everybody. You may suffer from a\nmental health condition yourself, know someone who\ndoes, or experience depression in the future. Increasing\nunderstanding and de-stigmatising depression could\nhelp you through a rough patch, or enable you to be\nthat awesome supportive friend in someone\u2019s time of\nneed.\nIf you want to get involved with the OpenMinds\ncampaign, email Moeko at disoff@imperial.ac.uk\nor find our Facebook page www.facebook.com/\nICOpenMinds.\nDepression \u2013 Taboo\nor Not Taboo?\nOpenMinds Campaign Team\nImperial College Union\nIC Disabilities Advisory Service disabilities@imperial.ac.uk\nIC Counselling Service counselling@imperial.ac.uk\nIC Health Centre imperialcollege.hc@nhs.net\nNightline 0207 631 0101\n(listening@nightline.org.uk)\nSamaritans 08457 90 90 90\n(jo@samaritans.org)\nMind www.mind.org.uk\nTime To Change www.time-to-change.org.uk\nDepression \u2013 My Story\nUseful Contacts\n\n"

    "content": "@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 22 NOV\nTELEVISION\ntches are here\nWitches of East\nEnd: Season 1\nJohn Park Television Editor\nRemember how awful it is when an\nAmerican actor tries to unsuccessfully\nimitate an English accent? Well here\nis the perfect example of where the\nopposite has gone completely wrong.\nYes, an English actress who tries (and\nsometimes it doesn\u2019t even sound like\nshe\u2019s trying one bit) to put on a convincing American accent. She fails\nevery episode of course, although that\nalone isn\u2019t enough to write this show\noff completely.\nJulia Ormond is the aforementioned\nguilty accent offender, as she ventures\nwildly between both dodgy American\nand sometimes proper posh English.\nShe plays Joanna Beauchamp, an immensely powerful, immortal witch\nwho is cursed with having to bury and\ngive birth to her daughters time and\ntime again no matter what she does\nto protect them. Her daughters Ingrid\n(Rachel Boston) and Freya (Jenna Dewan-Tatum) live until they reach the\nage of 30, die, then are soon reborn for\nJoanna to go through the painful cycle\nof giving birth and raising her daughters only for them to die all over again.\nThis time, Joanna is determined to\nhold on to her daughters, and so keeps\nthe magical powers a secret from her\nchildren. But it doesn\u2019t take long for\nthem to find out about their abilities,\nespecially when Joanna\u2019s fun-loving,\nmagic-practicing sister, the girls\u2019 aunt\nWendy (M\u00e4dchen Amick) drops by for\na visit.\nAs if this wasn\u2019t complicated enough\nfor Joanna, it turns out she has angered a lot of bad people over the\nyears thanks to her immortality and\npowers, and now one of them may be\nout for revenge. Before this evil can attack her beloved family, Joanna must\nrace against the clock, identify this\nforce, and contain the threat.\nIt\u2019s not just Joanna who is having\na tough time though. Each daughter\nhas soapy love-life problems to deal\nwith. Freya, recently engaged to Dash\nGardiner (Eric Winters), a dreamy\ndoctor, couldn\u2019t be happier, despite\nhis mother\u2019s (Virginia Madsen \u2013 who\nshould have a bigger role) frank disap-proval. This is until she starts having\nweird dreams about Killian (Daniel Di\nTomasso), the estranged brother of\nher fiance who she\u2019s never met. Very\nawkward indeed. Is there some sort\nof supernatural pull that is hinting at\ndestiny? Or is Freya just really into the\nwild child of the two sisters?\nIngrid has always been interested in\npagan rituals and witchcraft in general even before the discovery of her\npowers, but now that she\u2019s equipped\nwith the knowledge that she is, in fact,\na witch, it doesn\u2019t take long for her\nto start experimenting. She too has a\nlove interest, Adam (Jason Winston\nGeorge), the handsome cop, although\nthe need for secrecy surrounding her\nidentity makes it difficult for their relationship to move forward.\nWitches of East End is clearly more\nfun when it is spending time with\nmagic, not with individual relationship drama. Both Boston and DewanTatum have enough likability and\ncharm to carry their own plot strands,\nbut when compared to the weight and\ncharisma carried by Ormond (despite\nher horrendous, vomit-inducing ac-cent) and the refreshingly bright and\nperky Amick, they cannot quite hold\ntheir own. When the four of them\ncome together however, there is no\ntelling what they will be able to do.\nEven in the most dire circumstances,\nthe show remembers to have a lighter\ntouch, with humour spread throughout to make up for the shortfall when\nit comes to delivering the dramatic\ngoods. So far, nothing particularly\neye-catching has happened, but it\u2019s a\nshow with potential. Given the many\ncenturies Joanna has lived through,\nthere will no doubt be many flashback\nsequences that take us to all sorts of\ndifferent time periods. For those who\ncan\u2019t handle the madness of American\nHorror Story: Coven, here is another\nwitchy show whose spell you can fall\nunder.\nCartoon Corner\nTom Rivlin\nWelcome to Cartoon Corner, the\nnew weekly column where we explore the wonderful world of anima-tion! (Not anime. We have a separate club for that.) Each week I\u2019ll be\ndoing either a review of a currently\nairing show, or a retrospective on\nsomething more nostalgic. So, word\ncounts are tight here, let\u2019s start with\nan obvious one!\nAdventure Time!\n(Come on, grab your friends!)\nAdventure Time really is an ideal\nshow to start this column with, as\nit\u2019s a perfect example of a Cartoon\nNetwork kids\u2019 show reaching many\npeople outside its target audience on\nthe basis of it being just damn good.\nAt first it might be hard to see why \u2013\nthe show starts off rather unassum-ingly, dropping you without fanfare\ninto the world of Ooo, and introducing you to Finn (the human) and Jake\n(the dog\u2026 who can stretch his body\ninto limitless forms). More characters are introduced as time goes\non, however, and each one leaves an\nimpression in their own unique way.\nEarly episodes are seemingly simple,\nbut each one holds surprises and defies expectations.\nAs the show progresses, though, it\nbecomes clearer that it\u2019s really something special. The surrealist humour\nleads to countless memorable scenes\nand episodes, and the show swings\nbetween diabetes-inducing saccharine and horrifying terror with hilarious abruptness. Eventually you\nlearn more about the history of the\nmagical world they inhabit, and the\nshocking truth of Ooo\u2019s history casts\nthe entire series in a whole new,\nbleak light, yet the overall tone of\nthe show defiantly remains the same.\nPersonally, I think that the best\npart of the show is how wonderfully\nit shows Finn growing up. Like Aang\nin Avatar: The Last Airbender, he\nis voiced by an actual kid (Jeremy\nShada), whose voice breaks during\nthe show, and it really adds an extra dimension to the notion of Finn\nmaturing as time goes on. He experiences love, loss, pain and joy in ways\nthat feel very organic and real for a\nperson of his age, and most impor-tantly, we see him growing up.\nAdventure Time isn\u2019t my favourite\ncartoon of all time, but I completely\nunderstand how it gathered such a\nlarge fanbase, why it\u2019s always a hugely popular cosplay choice at conventions and how it has kept running for\n145 episodes (and counting). Simply\nput, it\u2019s a smartly written, charming,\nlight-hearted, yet often emotionally heavy adventure that I strongly\nrecommend you make time for. (See\nwhat I did there?) Each one is about\nten minutes long, so they\u2019re perfect\nrevision breaks for that holiday studying we\u2019re all definitely going to do\u2026\nNext time, a nostalgia trip: he\u2019s\ngotta get back, back to the past,\nSamurai Jack!\n\n"

A day\nfestival chocked full of\nthe best in UK emo, screamo and\nnoise rock is tough to say no to, so\nwe headed down to check out some\nbands. The two stages were staggered\nso you could see everything, and we\ndid our best.\nFirst up were Healing Powers, a\nshouty punk band from Durham who\nare definitely one to keep an eye on.\nAs good as the music was (and it was\ngreat), the main thing we took away\nwas their stage presence. A lead singer\nwho, whilst angrily shouting, looked\nreally cheerful as he bobbed up and\ndown and a bassist who never once\nturned to face the crowd. Certainly\na spectacle. Next up was COP, a\nnoisy punk band who were enjoyable\nif not, er, hugely memorable\u2026 next\nband! Mars to Stay are a jangly\nslowcore band whose live showing\nwas pretty weak. The guitar was a bit\ntoo loud and it all felt a bit over the\ntop. Playlounge brought the tempo\nback up with a set of two-man noise\nrock that can only be described as a\nNo Age clone. Don\u2019t worry though,\nthey are really good at it and a band\nI\u2019d definitely recommend. Cosmic\nThoughts were another noisy punk\nband and the first two songs blew us\naway and then they played a slow song\nthat never seemed to end. Luckily\nTwisted didn\u2019t slow down once \u2013 a\npulsating set of exciting noise rock\nwith some absolutely brilliant riffs.\nDefinitely a great discovery! Carson\nWells were on next. A fantastic\nscreamo band from Aberdeen who\nwere already a firm favourite with one\nof the group. Luckily, they didn\u2019t fail\nto deliver, and we all left thoroughly\nimpressed. Sadly, the next band were\nnot so popular amongst our group.\nBlood Sport are best (and kindly)\ndescribed as a shit Battles. By this\npoint the vegan food stall had set up,\nso a burger each definitely helped\ndeal with it. At this point there was\nan hour and a half break due to a play\nhappening in the building. We took\nthe time to recuperate in a local pub\nand then got straight back to it.\nFirst after the break were the\nincredible We Came Out Like\nTigers, a black metal screamo combo\nwho use a violin and spoken word\nsections as well as the more expected\nblast beats and brutal vocals. This\nperfomance was mindblowing. A\nfrontman who spent the set violently\nthrowing himself around the crowd\njust helped add to the mesmerising\nnature of it all. It was definitely\nsomething extremely different,\nL\nbut it really was\nspectacular. The fact\nthat we all loved this\nso much despite the\npolarising nature of\nthe genres involved\nreally shows that\nthere can still be\nbeauty in brutality.\nHuman Hands\nwere pretty decent,\nbut we were all still\nrecovering from the\nmajesty of the band\nbefore. Up next were Well Wisher,\nan upbeat emo-punk band who put\non a really enjoyable show, whilst\nnot being something to write home\nabout. Plaids definitely are an emo\nband who take heavy inspiration\nfrom first wave emo but still sound\nfresh and exciting. They didn\u2019t\ndisappoint live either, delivering a\ngreat set of all their best tracks. Nai\nHarvest were on next, and they didn\u2019t\ndisappoint either \u2013 a noodley, twinkly\nmidwest emo act who a couple of\nus have been big fans of for a while\nnow. They are also a band who have\ndisappointed live in the past. Not this\ntime. This time they were spot on.\nUp next was something very special.\nRaein are the kingpins of the Italian\nscreamo scene (it\u2019s a thing). They are\ncrushingly heavy when they want,\nbut also capable of beautiful melody\nand anthemic singalongs at the drop\nof a hat. This performance blew the\nplace apart. I\u2019m still finding bruises\nall over my body and my arm still isn\u2019t\ncompletely working but I don\u2019t regret\na single second. The main highlight\nwas definitely the entire front section\nlosing its shit for a spectacular\nsingalong performance of Tigersuit.\nThe penultimate act was Joanna\nGruesome, a noisey twee pop act\nwho put on a great show. Highlights\nincluded a great cover of Galaxie\n500\u2019s \u2018Tugboat\u2019 and the guitarist\nand bassist (who spent most of the\nset in the crowd) being lifted above\nthe crowd\u2019s heads against their will\nas they attempted to play their last\nsong. Headliners were Joan of Arc,\nSixteen Fantastic Bands and It\u2019s About Time!\nfronted by Tim Kinsella of Cap\u2019n Jazz\nand Owls fame. It was a really nice,\nmellow way to end the night. Sadly,\ndue to a few problems that happened\nwith the venue, they were cut short\nand only played for 35 minutes.\nThis was a spectacularly good\nday out. A fantastic advert for both\nthe UK emo scene and DIY shows\nin general. 16 bands, most of whom\nwere great, several of whom were\nbeyond great. There may have been\na few issues with timings towards\nthe end, but that was out of the\npromoters\u2019 hands, and to be honest,\ndidn\u2019t hugely detract from us having\nfun.\nI can say for sure that I will be\nmaking an appearance at About Time\n#3!\nA\nfter two consecutive\nnumber two albums\nand massive sets supporting both Eminem\nat Reading and Prodigy\nat Creamfields, Chase & Status have\nbecome one of the few dance acts with\na crossover appeal large enough to play\nan arena tour in support of their most\nrecent album, Brand New Machine.\nWhereas Pendulum or Prodigy did\nextended runs of late shows at Brixton\nAcademy during the heights of their respective popularities, Chase & Status\u2019\nshow at a venue that hosted One Direction for nine sold-out shows earlier this\nyear produced some bizarre contradic-tions, such as MC Rage encouraging\nfans to rave late into the night despite an\n11pm curfew and \u00a35 drinks.\nThe O2\u2019s lack of suitability for dance\nmusic did not get in the way of a good\ntime however. The 20,000 tickets to the\nshow sold out well in advance and most\nfans arrived very early to listen to the\nstrong support bill on offer. Pusha T is\nfeatured on one of the standout tracks\nfrom Brand New Machine (\u2018Machine\nGun\u2019) and so was a natural choice to support at such a large show. His affiliation\nwith Kanye West\u2019s GOOD Music label\nhas given him large numbers of followers in the UK and so his performance\nwas thoroughly enjoyed. A fellow drum\nand bass producer, Netsky, was selected\nas the main support and did not disap-point. He assembled an excellent band\nfor his live show and they flew through\nmany dance anthems in a half hour set,\nfinishing with Netsky\u2019s anthemic remix\nof \u2018Everyday\u2019 by Rusko.\nWith the crowd properly hyped for the\nmain act, Chase & Status came onstage\nand flew through their first few songs.\nWhile playing their second song, \u2018International\u2019\n, a blackout occurred and the\nrest of the song and \u2018No Problem\u2019\n, which\nfollowed, were played in darkness. MC\nRage informed the crowd that a particu-larlydestructivethrowndrinkhadhitthe\nlighting board and encouraged a chorus\nof boos towards the culprits. Neither\nthe band nor the crowd let the technical\nmalfunction dampen their spirits and as\nthe lights came back on, Tempa T burst\nonto the stage as the first guest vocalist\nof the night to help deliver an incredible\nrendition of Hypest Hype. Chase & Status played through many of the songs on\ntheir later two albums but also included\na few songs from their debut, More Than\nAlot. The show was spectacular, with\nChase and Status themselves playing\nsynths and sequencers from behind a gi-ant, illuminated C and S and explosions\nof pyrotechnics accompanying heavier\nparts of songs. MC Rage filled the brief\npauses between songs by keeping the\ncrowd jumping and anticipating what\nwas to come. Many more vocalists came\nout to add to the show, such as Liam Bailey during the excellent \u2018Blind Faith\u2019 and\nJacob Banks during Alive, and in cases\nwhere the singer was busy their face\nwould be displayed on the giant screens\naroundthearena(\u2018DelilahduringTime\u2019).\nThe two hour set sped by with the energy levels remaining high throughout.\nJust as the crowd were preparing for a\nnightofdancing,theencorewasuponus\nand Chase & Status finished on a high,\ntearing through an aggressive cover of\n\u2018Killing in the Name\u2019 by Rage Against\nthe Machine and finishing on the uptempo \u2018Fool Yourself\u2019\n. Chase & Status\ndefinitely put on a show worthy of any\nrock band currently touring but they\nhave had to sacrifice some things in pursuit of commercial success. The 11pm\nfinish meant the harder fans would be\noff to other events to dance the night\naway whereas a few years ago Chase &\nStatus would be playing that two hour\nset at 4am in Fabric with fans having just\nas good a time and I am sure a part of\nthem still wishes that was the case. Their\ngig was an excellent showcase of many\ndifferent dance genres (from jungle to\nhouse to trap to drum and bass) and\ntheir ability to produce a cohesive album\nusing all these influences and then tour\nit imaginatively and energetically has\ngained them many fans and allows them\nto retain the underground credibility\nthat first brought them to attention.\nRichard Clifton\nChasing The Dragon\n\n"

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 08 NOV\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201c\nThe recent summit\nhighlighted the\nCommonwealth\u2019s\ndangerous\ntrajectory. It will\nbe a rough road\nif it continues this\nway.\nThe Role & Responsibility of Comment\nC\nomment sections across\na broad variety of\nnewspapers all share a\ncommon thread. The bulk\nof their published material\nwill prove emotive for a sizeable\nportion of its readership. Individuals\nmay empathise with views expressed\nin a given article. Others may be\noffended. On occasion a given issue\nmay catalyse universal approval or (as\none has come to appreciate in the past\nseven days) disavowal of its material.\nIn context of a parochial University\ncommunity consisting of a spectrum\nof nationalities, ideals and beliefs\n(such as Imperial College London) the\nmargins for error are slight. In light\nof this I wish to briefly examine the\nboundaries for the Comment section.\nThe balance of facility and\nmediation of opinion is the central\ndilemma for the Comment section.\nAs was declared in the freshers\u2019\nissue in early October 2013 it is in\nplace to provide an extra medium of\ncommunication for the student body.\nThis commitment inevitably lies in\nthe category of facility. If a student\nsubmits an article they do so in good\nfaith. This should be honoured (where\nappropriate) during the process of\nediting and redaction.\nThe majority of contributors submit\na piece of writing on the basis of\nelemental and core convictions,\nheartfelt emotion or in light of\npersonal experience. Recent pieces\nsimilar to those centred on the\nInterfaith Movement, access for the\ndisabled or the changing dynamic of\nKenya typify the core aspiration of the\nComment section to voice rightfully\nemotive issues.\nWorldly reality means that many of\nthese emotive issues originate from\ninequality, illness, conflict and even\ndeath. This changes the atmosphere of\nthe Comment section with immediate\neffect. The focus of obligation for\nan editor should switch from the\nfacilitation of informative opinion to\nits mediation. This choice is made in\nan effort to engender peaceful and\naffirmative discussion and debate.\nThe mediation does not lie solely in\nthe physical editing of an individual\narticle. Mediation can be utilised\nby balancing a given article with a\ncounter-article. This can prove to\nbe insightful and constructive. My\nhead-to-head with Rory Fenton on\nintegrated education in the North of\nIreland helped me to view the issue\nfrom a more objective perspective. In\nspite of this, the approach can backfire.\nOur readership will have realised this\nover the past week. Some topics are\nA\ns the controversial\n23rd Commonwealth\nGovernmental meeting\nin Colombo closed\nearlier this week there\nwas widespread feeling that the\nCommonwealth has suffered a huge\ndent in its credibility. In March 2013\n(for the first time in its history) the\nCommonwealth set out a new charter\nemphasising the need for human\nrights, freedom of expression, good\ngovernance and the rule of law. Sri\nLanka (Commonwealth chair for the\nnext two years) frequently ignores\nthese tenets.\nLast weekend descended into\na public relations disaster of\nunprecedented proportions for both\nSri Lanka, and the Commonwealth.\nControversy over Sri Lanka\u2019s\nappalling human rights record\novershadowed the summit. The\nmeeting in Colombo (15th to 17th\nNovember) had the lowest attendance\nof State heads for years. Boycotts\nfrom Canada and Mauritius on\nthe grounds of human rights and\nan Indian snub dominated the\nevents preceding the meeting as the\nincumbent Government tried to\nrebrand Sri Lanka\u2019s image and deflect\nattention from its actions against the\nTamil population \u2013 it failed miserably.\nJohn Baird, Canadian Foreign\nMinister, noted on Commonwealth\ninaction on Sri Lanka that:\n\u201cCanada did not get involved in the\nCommonwealth to accommodate\nevil; we came to combat it\u201d. In a postcolonial era, as the Commonwealth\u2019s\nrelevance is increasingly debated, Sri\nLanka\u2019s chairing of an organisation\nthat has rebranded itself to be a force\nfor good dooms the organisation. The\nUKhascutitsCommonwealthfunding\nfollowing Canada\u2019s contribution\nreview. The most damning moment\ncame from the Mauritian President\nNavin Ramgoolam. Warned by the\nCommonwealth Secretary General,\nKamalesh Sharma, that it was\n\u201cconvention\u201d for the Head of State\nof country to host the summit the\nMauritian leader did not renege on\nhis boycott. He withdrew Mauritius\nhosting of CHOGM 2015.\nIt was the actions of David\nCameron that completely upstaged\nthe controversial summit. After the\nconclusion of the opening ceremony\nCameron departed on a historic trip\nto the capital of the Tamil homeland,\nJaffna. He became the first world\nleader to visit the war-affected city\nsince the end of colonialism in 1948.\nTo quote the PM what he viewed \u201cwill\nstay with [him]\u201d. He visited the printing\noffice of the popular Tamil newspaper\n(critical of Government), whilst\nuploading pictures of bullet holes in\nthe walls of the office and the burnt\nout shell of a printer to Twitter. The\noffice has been attacked repeatedly\nin recent years: 48 journalists have\nbeen killed in Sri Lanka within the last\ndecade and it is ranked in the bottom\n20 for press freedom. Most were\nTamil. Many more have fled abroad or\nsilenced their criticism. The chilling\npicture showcased the lack of freedom\nof expression in Sri Lanka, one of the\n\u201ccore values of the Commonwealth\u201d as\nthe Secretary General put it. It set the\nscene for the most sobering moment\nof the entire summit: as David\nCameron\u2019s motorcade passed through\nthe now militarily occupied city, scores\nof mothers clashed with riot police,\nseeking to bring attention to their\nplight. Over 140,000 Tamils remain\nunaccounted for in the Northern\nProvince. Many of these mothers\nhave sons who have disappeared since\nsurrendering to the Sri Lankan army\nat the end of 2009.

One wonders\nwhether the organisation will keep\nSri Lanka at the helm. With the\nUN Human Rights Commissioner\nNavi Pillay (and David Cameron)\nsetting a March 2014 deadline for\nthe Sri Lankan regime to conduct\nan independent investigation into\nthe litany of war crimes committed\nat the end of the 2009 war and the\nSri Lankan government remaining\nunwilling to do so, the stage is set for\na third resolution to the UN Human\nRights Council against Sri Lanka. The\nfact that the chair of an organisation\nemphasising human rights as one of\nits core values could be the target of\na UN resolution will be disastrous for\nthe Commonwealth. This is precisely\nwhy Cameron must call for Sri Lanka\nto be suspend and their chairmanship\nrevoked.\nThe Secretary General of the\nCommonwealth has continually\nshielded Sri Lanka from criticism for\nskewed towards one plaintive truth,\nat least in the eyes of the majority of\nthe socio-political body.

    "content": "29\nFRIDAY 22 NOV\nGAMES\nMaximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\nImran Rashid\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames Editor\nI\nhave meant to write this article\nfor quite a while. This game was\nreleased on the 3 of september\n2013, almost two months ago.\nI had pre-ordered it almost a\nmonth earlier in my excitement. Let\nme just explain to you, I LOVED the\nTotal War series. Beginning with\nMedieval, all the way to Empire, I\nhad been a fan of this series. It just\nepitomised everything that a strategy\ngame was supposed to be. Complex\nenough to keep me playing for hours,\nyet simple enough to pick it up and\nunderstand everything within 5\nminutes. These games were exactly\nwhat I thought the perfect strategy\ngame should be. All in all, for those 4\ngames I must have poured roughly 800\nhours into this game over 6 years. In\nfact with the original Rome Total War\nI managed to conquer the entire map\nwith three different factions. It was\npretty much the only game I played in\nmy school days.\nBefore we get to the actual review\nof the game, let me just recap what\nthis game is about. Basically you are\ndropped in ancient Europe and take\ncontrol of one of the multitude of\nfactions that were around at that time.\nYou can use diplomacy, economy\nor outright warfare to dominate\nyour neighbours and ultimately the\nentire world. On your way to world\ndomination you will be faced with\nseveral objectives, choices and epic\nbattles. However what makes the total\nwar series unique is the mix between\nturn based strategy on the campaign\nmap (you can see the entirety of\nEurope) and the real time strategy on\nthe local battlefield. This gives you\nthe ability to playing the emperor,\ncontrolling large swathes of the\nancient world, as well as the general\nwho has to motivate is tired and rain\ndrenched soldiers.\nNow let us return from the ancient\nages and fast forward to the 3rd of\nseptember of this year. After following\nthe dev blog for several months,\nreading every piece of news I could\nget my hands on, the day had come.\nAfter having pre-loaded the game\nonto my computer, I was stoked and\nexcited. I was ready to play. I fired\nup the game and got right into the\ntutorial. My first impression was\nthat, while everything seemed quite\nsimilar to my old experiences there\nwere still many quite significant new\nadditions. Quickly my excitement\nturned to horror as I realised how\nmuch they had changed from my\nRome 2, Totally worth it?\nbeloved sequel. Gone were the family\ntrees that let you see all your faction\ncharacters, gone was the option of\nmicromanaging a town, gone was the\nability to friggin pause your battle with\nthe space bar (trust me, for me that\nwas the absolute worst. I cannot tell\nyou the amount of times I have hit the\nspace bar expecting to stop time and\nreorder my troops, and just see them\nobliviously marching to their doom).\nIn fact, a lot had gone that I had loved\nabout the Total war series. Instead,\non my first impression, I saw a game\nthat was trying to be what I enjoyed\nbut couldn\u2019t decide between being\nto difficult or to easy, too bloated or\nthin on material. In fact, after I had\ncompleted the tutorial and played\nsome token rounds of the normal\ncampaign. I stopped and didn\u2019t play\nthe game again for a month.\nThiswastheultimatedisappointment\nfor me. One of the cons that stick with\nme from those first impressions was\nthe ridiculous amount of factions.\nThis made starting out a diplomatic\nminefield (oh how I missed being\nsurrounded by rebels which I could\nattack without any moral qualms), it\nalso made the end of turn wait almost\nunbearable further into the game. If\nyou turned on the option to see the\nAI moves, then you would literally\nwait ten minutes and just see horses\nmoving back and forth. By the time\nyour move came back again, you had\nforgotten everything you wanted to\ndo. Another were several actions that\ncreators of the game seemed to expect\nyou would take for granted. I mean I\ncouldn\u2019t for my life understand why\nI couldn\u2019t garrison my town. It took\nme several frustrated turns to figure\nout that the buildings in that town\nprovided it with soldiers. My biggest\ncomplaint though is the slowness of\nthe game. I remember being able to\ntake of large swathes of Europe on\nthe easy setting within the first couple\nmoves in the first Rome. However\nhere even in Rome 2, it takes me 10\nmoves to take over italy alone. It just\nmakes everything seem to drag along.\nTherefore my lack of incentive to pick\nthis game up again.\nHowever my guilty conscious\nwould not let me go. I loved this\nseries, I payed money for this game.\nI was going to give it another chance.\nAnother chance I did give it. And\non second viewing I did find some\npositives. Without my over hyped\nexpectations I could appreciate things\nthat my bitter eyes had overseen in my\nfirst sitting. The update in graphics\nis absolutely great and some of the\nadditions are not that bad! I mean the\nnaval battles recapture some of that\nepicness I felt when I first played the\nTotal war games. Also the new battle\nmechanics make the battles so much\nmore immersive and realistic! In fact\nthe second session was significantly\nlonger than the first failed one, and\nthere will be many more.\nAll in all I think this game is quite an\nachievement, apart from some cons\nwhich are being cleaned up in each\nsuccessive update, and was worth the\n\u00a330 pounds I spent. However I guess\nI made the mistake of playing it like it\nwas the first Rome, which it wasn\u2019t. It\nis its own game, and cannot be seen\nas a twin (albeit higher graphics) than\nits predecessor. So if you are someone\nwho is happy with their old Total war\ngames, and sees absolutely no reason\nto change, in fact would abhor change,\navoid this game. It will just disappoint\nyou. However if you are looking for\na new approach to this classic series,\nand don\u2019t have too high expectations I\nwould suggest go for it!\nNow I\u2019m off to conquer the world\nwith....hmm...I\u2019m feeling the Iceni\n(brits) today!\nDoes this sequel to one of the best strategies games live up to the hype?\nTHE DRUID\nTHE DRUID\nNew Addition: Screenshot of the week!\nSend in your stuff\nThis is a call out to all you\ngamers out there. If you have a\nfunny/bizarre/epic screenshot\nyou wish to share just send it\nto : games.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nAt the end of the year we will\ntally up all the scores and the\nwinner will win a free game!\nFinally your chance to achieve\nsome kind of fame and glory!\nFelix Games Team\n\n"

On top\nof that, City are extremely strong at\nhome and it\u2019s hard to see Spurs troubling them. Andre Villas-Boas will\nprobably set up defensively and play\nfor a point as he has done in recent\nmatches, but can Spurs hold out for\n90 minutes? I doubt it.\nPrediction: 2-0\nEverton v Liverpool\n(Saturday 12:45pm, BT Sports 1)\nThis should be a cracking Merseyside derby. Both sides play attractive\nfootball and have shown flair, hunger\nand real quality all season. Everton are\nunbeaten at Goodison Park this year,\nbut they come up against the Premier\nLeague\u2019s strongest attacking pair in\nLuis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. All\n22 players on the pitch will be up for\nthis, so expect goals. If it was at Anfield I would give Liverpool the edge\nbut the Toffees are so strong at home\nthat I have to go for a draw.\nPrediction: 2-2\nWest Ham v Chelsea\n(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)\nChelsea went into the international\nbreak on a bit of a downer, mustering\n1 point from 6 against Newcastle and\nWest Brom, and even that was courtesy of a highly contentious penalty\ndecision. West Ham also lost at Norwich, but the big difference between\nthese sides is in attack. Mourinho can\ncall upon Fernando Torres, Demba\nBa, Samuel Eto\u2019o and a wealth of mid-fielders, whereas Big Sam has nobody.\nHe can use the small Upton Park pitch\nto his advantage and restrict Chelsea\u2019s\nwidth, but the Blues will ultimately\nhave too much class.\nPrediction: 1-2\nCardiff v Man Utd\n(Sunday 4pm, Sky Sports 1)\nMan City came away from Cardiff\nempty-handed earlier in the season\nand David Moyes\u2019 men will be put\nthrough their paces here. They simply\ncannot afford to drop any more points\nthough and Rooney and van Persie\nshould see them over the line.\nPrediction: 1-2\nWest Brom v Aston Villa\nWest Brom finally look the complete\nfootballing outfit, and Steve Clarke is\nright to say they would be higher up\nthe table but for some poor refereeing decisions. Aston Villa\u2019s best performances come away from home but\nwith Christian Benteke off colour, the\nBaggies can claim bragging rights in\nthe Midlands derby.\nPrediction: 2-1\nBest of the rest\nArsenal v Southampton\nWho would have thought this would\nbe 1st versus 3rd place at the start of\nthe season? Both sides are doing brilliantly and Saints will be as hard as\never to break down, but the Gunners\nare very hard to oppose right now.\nPrediction: 2-1\nFulham v Swansea\nSwansea have made a slow start so it\u2019s\njust as well for Michael Laudrup that\nFulham are playing like amateurs at\nthe moment. Craven Cottage does not\nsuit the Swans\u2019 expansive footballing\nstyle but they are the better side and\nshould take at least a point back to\nSouth Wales.\nPrediction: 1-1\nHull v Crystal Palace\nCrystal Palace\u2019s best two recent displays have been at home to Arsenal\nand Everton, but they scored in neither and goals are their biggest prob-lem. Hull are by no means a free scoring side but they know how to win\nugly at the KC Stadium.\nPrediction: 2-0\nNewcastle v Norwich\nThe biggest challenge for Chris\nHughton is to prove Norwich\u2019s win\nagainst West Ham wasn\u2019t just a flash\nin the pan. They need to build on that,\nbut their away record is abysmal and\nNewcastle\u2019s French midfield maestros\nhave the flair to hurt them.\nPrediction: 2-0\nStoke v Sunderland\nStoke haven\u2019t won since August but\nMark Hughes won\u2019t face an easier\ngame all season. Sunderland have issues all over the pitch and the Potters\nshould have enough to edge this one.\nOnly at rock-bottom Crystal Palace\nhave the Black Cats won away from\nWearside.\nPrediction: 1-0\nWater Polo:\nGermany Tour\nDiary\nTo kick off the season, the water\npolo team returned for the fifth time\nto Germany for the Aachen Annual\nWater Polo Tournament. Not having\npreviously won any matches in\nGermany, the team arrived with no\nexpectations other than giving it\ntheir best shot and getting in a lot\nof playing time to allow all levels\nof players improve their skills.\nThe tournament kicked off on\nthe Saturday morning after a short\nnight of sleep in the corridor for\nmost people, with Maurice sleeping\non the bar top. The girls kicked off\nwith the first match. Starting out\nmodestly, they picked it up in the\nsecond half with Jo scoring our first\ngoal of the day. Although the girls\nplayed well, the other team was too\nstrong, leaving the girls at a 1-5 loss.\nThe girls\u2019 second match was tougher,\nwith the other team playing violently\nand the match resulted in a 1-7 loss\nwith another goal from Jo.\nThe guys started a bit slowly in\ntheir first match but got better in\nthe second half with Tim getting two\ngoals in and our fresher Irish James\ngetting in another goal. We also had\nStuart put the ball in the corner of\nthe goal after a good pass by Tim.\nThe guys lost the match 4-10 but,\nscoring more goals in this match than\nwe have in the whole tournament\nin previous years, the guys were\npleased with their performance. The\nsecond match of the day was tougher\nfor the guys but Alex scored in the\nsecond half leaving the final score to\nbe 1-10.\nSaturday night the team got ready\nfor the legendary water polo party.\nOur team mascot The Blumenkholen\nwas broken early in the evening, but\nthis did not stop TJ from getting\nphotos with all the girls at the party.\nThanks to Tom BF Imperial were\nthe last to leave the party only three\nhours before the first match on\nSunday morning. After some good\nnavigation and some solid driving\nfrom Stu (mainly on the right side\nof the road) the team arrived safely\nat the pool. The guys\u2019 match kicked\noff at 9 am and impressively all the\nguys got in the pool. The hangovers\nand lack of sleep left the guys badly\ndefeated 9-0. Their second match\nof the day was more successful with\nIrish James scoring 3 goals, one\nof them beautifully set up by an\ninterception, sprint and assist from\nJackson. Captain James took on the\nstrongest German player he could\nfind to protect the freshers and\nstill managed to get in a solid goal.\nThe match ended 4-6 with another\nloss, but it was still one of the best\nmatches we have played, so everyone\nwas pleased.\nThe girls also had a match on the\nlast day and, with a motivational\ntalk from Joey, they all tried to\nforget their pounding heads, giving\neverything in the last match.\nStarting off strong Jo managed\nto get in a goal early in the match,\ngiving us an edge over the other\nteam. Smashing in another goal in\nthe second half, the excitement was\nrising as the girls won their first ever\nmatch in Germany 2-0!\nSatisfied with the weekend and\ntheir progression, the team is ready\nto take on the other UK universities\nknowing nothing will compare to the\nGerman beasts.\nLillan Agerup reports as IC Water\nin Germany\nIC WATER POLO\nThe Ashes\nColumn\nKunal Wagle\nSports Editor\nI\nf there is one thing that almost\nseems certain, it is that England\nface a much tougher task than\nthe one they undertook during\nthe summer. With the addition\nof George Bailey (who showed strong\nform in the recent one-day series in\nIndia), Australia\u2019s batting looks a bit\nstronger. England\u2019s bowling hasn\u2019t\nimpressed as much as they would\nhave liked in the tour matches, and\nthe England management don\u2019t seem\ntoo sure which bowling combination\nis their strongest.\nHowever, England would have been\nvery strongly encouraged by their toporder\u2019s batting performance. Michael\nCarberry has shown that he is the\nideal partner to Alistair Cook, which\nwould also allow Joe Root to remain\nin the lower order where he has had\nmore success.\nMitchell Johnson has been added to\nthe bowling attack for Australia and\nhas been looking dangerous \u2013 especially during the one-day series against\nIndia. James Faulkner, the Australian\nall-rounder, will also be expected to\nplay in the test after showing his explosive credentials against India. In\nthe five games against India, Faulkner\nscored 65 and 116 \u2013 both at strike\nrates of higher than 150. However, despite this, his bowling was below par,\nand he will be looking to correct that\nin this series. The key to Australia\u2019s\nchallenge will be Michael Clarke and\nRyan Harris, both of whom are injury\nprone. The Australian backroom staff\nwill have to work overtime to make\nsure both last the series.\nWriting the day before the Brisbane\ntest begins, it is clear that whilst England will be tested more than they\nwere this summer, they should have\nmore than enough firepower to take\nthe series comfortably. Pessimists,\nhowever, will point out that, whilst\nEngland won 3-0, they were probably\nsaved in two tests by a combination\nof rain and contentious decisions. If\nthose decisions had gone Australia\u2019s\nway, the series may have ended differ-ently. They have to be wary of that this\ntime round.\nGETTY IMAGES\nWriting on the eve of the\nAshes, in our new column\nwe preview the series\n\n"

    "content": "38 FRIDAY 22 NOV\nSPORT Editor: Kunal Wagle\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIC beat Subway\nsellers\nI\nt was a cold frosty morning;\nluckily the weather was a\nlittle more stable than Frosty\u2019s\nstomach walls. Beasley faced\na huge debate though: to wear\na layer underneath or not. Sacrifice\nwarmth and endure the possibility\nof nipple chaffing, or lose vital fluids.\nIt was a tough choice, almost on par\nwith the age-old optimal banana\nconsumption time and optimal\nshower temperature. We got out on to\nthe pitch well before the opposition,\nmaking sure to lock all of our lectures\nnotes in a safe. As we were warming\nup, the second half of Westminster\n1s arrived, opting to jump out over a\nbarbed wire fence rather than walking\nround to the actual entrance \u2013 clearly\na bright bunch. I hope they\u2019re a little\nsmarter when I tell them what I want\nin my Subway.\nWanting to bounce back from two\n1-0 defeats, high pressing, hard work\nand plenty of chat were on the agen-da. Dale was missing from the warm\nup, which has become the norm on\na Wednesday night. Captain Robinson led the pressure from the front,\nshouting out multiple orders at their\nback four who scrambled to find the\nBLT. Rumour has it he only takes girls\nto Subway to see if they can handle a\nfoot long. Vicious. The pressure from\nthe team was starting to pay off as\nWestminster panicked at the back\nand they had no outlet on the pitch.\nInstead they had a lump up top, but\nall of that muscle meant nothing as\nDiaz and Amjad didn\u2019t even have to\ncome out of first gear to beat him to\nthe ball. His touch was terrible, and\nWestminster were routinely broken\ndown. We ended the first half well on\ntop, passes were slick, wingers were\nskinning defenders and Crawford had\nresisted the temptation to wade in to\nthe Children\u2019s Activity Centre. All we\nlacked was a goal.\nThe second half almost delivered\none instantly. From the restart, Cherif\nplayed a ball in behind to Murphy who\nlatched on to it and fizzed it invitingly\nacross the box, with Robinson just getting his first time finish the wrong side\nof the left post. It was promising from\nIC, who needed a goal more than the\nUnion needs efficiency. IC continued\nwith high pressing and were awarded\na few free kicks, but when nothing\nwas coming to fruition, we stayed disciplined and kept plugging away. Murphy then won another free kick on the\nedge of the box. After squandering a\nfew free kicks previously, he had to\nmake this one count, and he did. Sending the future Subway employee that\nwas their goalkeeper sprawling across\nthe goal to try and reach the ball, his\nefforts were pointless as the ball went\nin off the far post. IC erupted like a\nvirgin reaching a climax; all the hard\nwork had paid off and there was definitely the capacity for more goals. IC\nwere creating loads of chances, slipping balls in behind their back four,\nhowever the aforementioned lump,\nwith a touch that would get him on a\nparticular register, decided that ejaculating wasn\u2019t the only thing he would\nbe doing prematurely today. Now in\nthe role of linesman he was flagging\nabsolutely every through ball to Robinson offside, but, to be fair, he probably didn\u2019t know the offside rule. It\u2019s\nnot a problem though, as I\u2019m sure they\nhave plenty of ketchup, salt and pepper in Subway for him to learn. Bend\nIt Like Beckham.\nWithIC\u2019suniquebrandofhighpressing football beginning to take a toll on\nthem, the game started to open up a\nbit, although Westminster\u2019s non existent knowledge of the offside rule ran\nthroughout their whole team, as they\nwere caught offside multiple times by\na militant back four. IC almost extended the lead to 2-0 as Captain Robinson\npulled off a diving header, but wanted\nit a little bit too much and sent the ball\nin off his hands. The last 10 minutes\nwere a bit shaky but with the deployment of Crawford and Beasley we saw\nthe game out well.\nIC win in Cup\nPaul Nugent\n1st XI Football Player\nLUSL Cup days \u2013 the highlight of\nany IC footballer\u2019s career, more\nmagic than the FA Cup and more\ngrit and determination than a\ndrunken iNuge verbally attacking\na granny on a night bus after the\nunion.\nWe were facing off against Kings\nMedics 2s, who we overturned in\nthe Semi Final on our way to winning the cup last season. We face\ntheir 1s, who won the LUSL league\nlast year, later in the campaign, and\nwe needed to send a message to\nthem, much like we did to UCL\u2019s 1s\nearlier in the season (By thrashing\ntheir 2s 13-0 in a friendly). Murphy was noticeably missing, as was\nCrawford. Suspicious. Rumour has\nit they were on a romantic getaway\ntogether; neither were available to\ncomment as they were both \u2018busy\u2019.\nThe football was fast flowing\nfrom IC and the midfield trio of\nCherif, Ayanwale and Hill were\nkeeping the ball well in midfield\nand hitting the channels well. Dale\nwas beating his man all day for\npace on the right and Prestinoni\u2019s\ndribbling skills meant that Kings\nMedics didn\u2019t see much of the ball,\nand when they did, the back four\u2019s\nmilitant back line caught them off-side. The goal came as quickly as an\nover excited fresher in bed. Dale\ngot down the right, eating his man\nfor breakfast (that\u2019s not the only\nthing he eats, ladies), playing the\nball square through the CBs legs,\nand directly in the path of Captain\nRobinson who opened his body\nout in a Nugent-esque fashion and\nslotted the ball in. The keeper was\nonce again left sprawled, legs open\nand dominated (Robinson, 2013).\nRumour has it Captain Robinson snapchatted a picture of their\nkeeper to all his friends to gloat.\nNot that he\u2019s done anything like\nthat before.\nWe went in at half time 1-0 to the\ngood. Our lead was quickly doubled as Prestinoni\u2019s tight dribbling\nsaw him maze past several players\nbefore wading into the box and being hacked down by their CB. Captain Robinson stepped up to take\nthe penalty, and he grabbed the\nchance by the balls and squeezed as\nhard he could, thrashing the ball in\nto the bottom left corner and sending the keeper the opposite way. 2-0,\nadvantage ICs. From an absolutely\nhuge goal kick from Wells which\nbypassed even their centre backs,\nCaptain Robinson drifted in from\nthe left and in behind the defence to\ntake the ball first time on his chest,\ninstantly putting him one on one\nwith the goalkeeper which he easily\ndispatched via a wonderful volley in\nto the back of the net to round off a\nhat trick.\nThe tie wasn\u2019t over yet though as\nKing\u2019s Medics pulled one back from\na corner. We did well to hold off any\nmore pressure and contain them\nfollowing their goal. Beasley\u2019s introduction saw the game settle in our\nfavour and his warm up was so quick\nhe actually got out of the illustrious\nsecond gear. Nielsen and Nugent\ntook it upon themselves to bomb up\nthe pitch and try and reclaim some\nmuch needed fantasy points. Shamsi\nhad other ideas though, making a\ngood run down the middle allowing Dale to play him in, however he\ndid his best to put the ball anywhere\nbut on target. 3-1 was the final score\nand saw IC 1s progress in to the next\nround of the cup.\nPaul Nugent gives the juicy details\nOn both Wednesday 13th and Saturday 16th of November, the ICUAFC\n3rd team played the King\u2019s College\n2nd team, home and away respec-tively.\nOn the Wednesday, coming off the\nback of some huge confidence boosting wins in both the BUCS and LUSL\ncups (#cuprun), the atmosphere\nwithin the squad was teething with\ntension to test ourselves against a respected side.\nWhen kick-off did come and was\nfollowed moments later by a clattering Taha Butt tackle, it was evident\nthat this fixture was going to be a\ntightly-fought affair.\nSolid defending from both sides\nmeant chances were few and far between in the first half. A tireless Francis Nwobu nearly eked a goal from\na bouncy through-ball from Myles\nJarvis, only to be cruelly denied with\na stellar off-balance claw away from\nthe goal line by the King\u2019s keeper. Perhaps the best chance of the half fell to\nJulian Iacoponi \u2013 playing the floating\nrole on the edge of the box at a corner \u2013 but unfortunately the ensuing\nbounce volley which fell to him so\nsweetly rose bitterly over the bar.\nBoth teams were content with going\ninto the half-time break at 0-0. Starting the second half with a positive\nmind set, Alex Whittington slipped\na stellar sliding pass into the feet of\nMyles who, leading from the front as\nskipper, slotted away.\nInitial 1-0 nerves kicked in as some\nsloppy passes left the IC goal exposed,\nrequiring some strong sweeper-keeper play from Sanjiv Dutt. Despite\nsome sustained pressure, Miles Covers\u2019 orbital throw-ins helped IC get\nback into King\u2019s territory, and the 3s\nstarted to dominate again.\nWith the defence becoming more\ncompact and composed with the\nAnglo-French pairing of Jack \u2018Allez\u2019\nPeacock and Vincent Avena ruling\nover the King\u2019s attack, the 3s started\npenetrating behind the King\u2019s defence\nwith Adam Marks linking up well with\nNaven Ghulam up the right flank.\nThe game was tilting in IC\u2019s favour,\nand Francis began imposing himself\non the towering King\u2019s centre-halves\nevermore. Muscling out his opposing\ndefender, he lofted a defence-splitting\nball through to a sprinting Julian Iacoponi to challenge for a 50-50 with the\nKing\u2019s keeper, only for the fresher to\nsky his shot, again. This time however,\nthe aerial route to goal was deliber-ate, with the chip-cum-lob over the\ngoalie \u2013 despite convincing the rest of\nthe team it was going into the hockey\npitches over the fence \u2013 dropping in at\nas vertical an angle as possible, going\ninto both the top and bottom corner\nsimultaneously: not something you\ncan say everyday about a goal!\nRelentless one-twos down the wing\nled to more crosses and corners, one\nof which fell to Julian, sneaking in\nat the back post, to slot a soft volley\nfinish inside of the post. Right place,\nright time, and it was 3-0 with IC in\ncruise control. An audacious bicycle\nkick effort on goal from Alex Whittington \u2013 spectacularly saved by the\nopposition keeper \u2013 was the highlight\nof the remainder of play, whilst the\nback four ensured a clean sheet with\nyet more confident clearances and\nclear communication. What a victory,\nand what a day.\nThe return leg on the following\nSaturday the 16th was away at King\u2019s\nhome pitches at Berrylands (#For-tressB), and proved just as fruitful,\nwith another 3-0 3-pointer secured\nfor the magical 3s. This match-up\ntranspired to be another cagey affair,\nand was indeed tighter than Alex \u2018Tutti-Frutti\u2019 Hugh-Wilson\u2019s infamously\nskinny skinny-jeans. Chris Aspinall\nmade some crucial blocks in goal to\nkeep his sheet clean, and Adam Marks\nhad his strongest performance of the\nseason (if not the best performance by\nany player in any season) in defence\nand attack, timing tackles and containing the King\u2019s flank play, whilst\npicking out his winger with scientific\nprecision and reliability. This even\nprompted an onlooker to say, \u201cDoes\nyour right back usually play for a higher team?\u201d \u2013 high praise for the East\nCornwall cornerback.\nThe game was finally unlocked at\nthe 70 minute mark, courtesy of a narrow pitch and those aforementioned\nrocket-like long throws from left-back\nMiles Covers, which somehow small-est-man-in-the-club Myles Jarvis got\non the end of, to slot in an opportunistic goal. The other goals again came\nfrom the skipper-scorer-supreme: one\nfrom a cracking free-kick cross causing the King\u2019s keeper to fumble into\nthe net, and the other a tap in after\nright-winger Alex \u2018Fantasy Futsal\u2019\nHassan placed the ball expertly into\nthat famously most uncertain of cor-ridors, which Myles smashed in at the\nfar post.\n3-0 and the match secured, it was\ntime for celebrations to begin.\nIC do the double over KCL\nJulian Iacoponi describes the action\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\n\n"

    "content": "30 FRIDAY 22 NOV\nGAMES\n@felixgames\nfacebook.com/FelixImperial\nRecently I have picked up a few\ngames through steam sales which I\nhave loved for their originality. These\nwere cheap games in which I have\nalready racked up an impressive (or\nunimpressive depending on your\nviewpoint) number of hours in. So\nif you\u2019re looking for a great game to\nadd to your steam libraries read on.\nEscape Goat is a puzzle platformer\nan engaging game. Visually I think the\ngame looks awesome, and it reminds\nme of games such as Doom and Hexen.\nStrangely where this game really stands\nout for me is the soundtrack. Escape\nGoat has a beautiful 8-bit Beverly Hills\ncop themed soundtrack which I loved\nso much that I downloaded it and put\nit on my IPod (which you can do for\nfree). For the price this game is great\nand you will get your money\u2019s worth.\nI had heard about Hotline Miami\nfrom a friend and instantly wanted to\nbuy it but held off until it appeared in\na sale. This top down view game has\nyou carrying out hit jobs normally in\npeople\u2019s flats. You start off with just\nyour fists but as you take down people\nyou can pick up their weapons and the\nmore you play the more weapons there\nare. Each mission you get to choose a\nmask that gives you special abilities.\nYou start with a mask that doesn\u2019t do\nanything but over time you start to\nbuild a collection of some pretty useful abilities. My favourite was a mask\nthat enabled you to kill your enemies\nby slamming a door into them (which\nnormally just knocks them out). This\nled to a time where feeling trapped\nI fired off the last of my gun. When I\nlooked back at the screen everyone was\ndead because they had been killed by\nthe door I was standing behind. This\nhowever was extremely lucky as in general this game is hard! Each floor of a\nbuilding will need to be completed in\none go and this leads to frustration but\na massive feeling of success when you\nfinally manage to kill everyone. The\nlevels remain fresh by adding interactive elements (picking up a pan of boiling water from a kitchen), and different enemy configurations. Sometimes\nyou are forced to be stealthy or just\nrun in and be quick, but on the most\npart each level can be completed in\nmany different ways and it\u2019s this creativity that makes the game so much\nfun. Not visually demanding this game\ncan be run on most machines and will\nadd a fun game to anyone steams library if you can handle the violence.\nin which you play as a goat accused\nof witchcraft and thrown in prison.\nYou must escape by awakening several sheep which you find at the end of\n6 levels. This game has classic puzzle\nelements such as pushing switches in\nthe right order, not getting trapped etc\nand platformer elements like jumping\nand jumping higher. However where\nEscape Goat differs is in the new mechanics it adds. How will you solve\npuzzles while being blasted by invincible fire ball throwing wizards? By using\nthe new tools the game gives you, such\nas your mouse friend who can travel in\nsmall cracks and climb walls and the\nmagic hat which, in select puzzles, lets\nyou teleport to your mouse friend. Ok\nI can see that this game sounds ridicu-lous, but it really works. The puzzles\nare inventive and fun to solve, and the\nplatform elements add to make this\nLast week my fellow games Editor\nMaximilian Eggl pointed out some of\nthe main differences between the upcoming PS4 and Xbox One. Although\nI see many good things in both of these\nconsoles I feel that even though it has\nalready been out for a year, the Wii\nU deserves a mention. I am, as some\nmay have noticed, a pretty hardcore\nNintendo fan but I shall try and keep\nthis as informative and unbiased as\nI can. So here follows an account of\nwhy I believe the Wii U is a real competitor and something that should\nbe considered, and just a general\noverview of what I think of consoles.\nMaybe the first thing to start with in\na console comparison review is a little\nbackground of consoles I own. Nintendo wise I own everything back to the\nSNES and hopefully one day I will get\na NES too. With Sony I have a PSP go\nand a PS2, and from Microsoft I have\nthe Xbox 360. So as you can see I have\nowned a little of everything. In the last\ngeneration of consoles despite loving\nthe Wii my favourite was the Xbox 360.\nI played my Xbox to death (literally\nmany red lights of doom death) and\nI just went straight out and bought a\nnew one. I preferred the Xbox mainly\nbecause it had pretty much every title I wanted to play. I was a major fan\nof Halo (until 4) and Assassins Creed\n(until Revelation\u2019s), and played a stupid\namount of GTA4. This is something I\ndownload just about every classic game\nthat I dearly missed from the Nintendo\n64 and back (except Donkey Kong 64).\nThings changed when I got my com-puter. I was able to download cheaply\nin Steam sales just about every game I\nhad loved on the Xbox and play these\nwith the wired controller plugged into\na USB socket. My Xbox was therefore\nreplaced by the superior (and quieter\ncomputer). My Wii however was not\nreplaced. It was still my TV console of\nchoice, enabling me to relax and play\nclassic games, and the excellent Wii\ngames Nintendo makes. I did miss\nthe Xbox but my new gaming comcouldn\u2019t have done on the Wii! So then\nwhy did I play my Wii? Simply because\nit\u2019s the only way to play games in my favourite franchises of all time. Nintendo\nconsoles are and always will be the only\nway to\np l a y\nM a r i o ,\nDonkey Kong, Zelda, Metroid, Super\nSmash Bros\u2026 In my view these games\nare unique, and as mentioned before\nthere is nothing else like them on any\nother console and in this way Nintendo\nhas the best exclusive title lineup. Yes\nXbox has Halo which I dearly love,\nhowever there are other shooter games\non just about every console. In fact\norignially I bought a Wii entirely for\nthe Virtual Console. Here I was able to\nbination of Wii and computer was\nfar more suited towards my needs.\nIboughttheWiiUshortlyafterlaunch\nfor many reasons. Primarily because\nI wanted to play the new Nintendo\ngames\nthat\nw e re\nc o m i n g\nout such as New Super Mario Brothers Wii U, but also because I wanted\nback something of the console gaming feeling. Sometimes I just prefer\nto lie back in my bed playing games\non the TV rather than sat at the com-puter. This time around though, I think\nthe Wii U is enough to not make me\nwant the Xbox One or PS4. It is powerful enough to have 3rd party games.\nAt launch it had titles I really wanted\nto play, Assassins Creed 3 and Batman\nArkham City (which, even though I\nplayed before, wasn\u2019t boring to play as\nthey revamped it for the Wii U). The\nWii U controller itself has a large screen\nwhich enables you to play most games\nentirely on it and, despite the size, is really comfortable to hold. It even offers\ninteresting multiplayer options where\none person uses the controller screen\nand the other the TV. If you still want a\ncontroller more like the Xbox and PlayStation ones, Nintendo offers the Pro\nController which is super comfortable,\nlooks great and has crazy long battery\nlife. For some games you can even use\nthe Wii remote and Nunchuck. For me\nthis just shows that Nintendo lets you\nplay games exactly as you want. Playing\nBlack Ops 2 on Veteran difficulty with\nthe Wii Zapper attachment is epic and\nmakes up for any loss in graphic qual-ity. If you want amazing graphics why\nnot just invest once in a computer?\nNintendo is also the only next gen\nconsole to offer free online multi-player. Unfortunately the Wii U isn\u2019t\ngetting every new title (GTA5) but\nas I can pick most of these up on the\ncomputer I am not too bothered.\nIn the end the Wii U is a great living room console, which lets you play\ngames how you want. It offers the most\ndiverse controller options, is the only\nbackwards compatible console, has a\ngreat line up on the virtual console and\nhas on demand TV services such as\nNetflix. When considering which console you want I hope you pay attention\nto the Wii U. It is currently available\nfor \u00a3230 (far cheaper than its competi-tors) and will only get better with time.\nWii U No consider Nintendo?\nCalum Skene\nGames Editor\nCalum Skene reviews some great indie games (yes, again)!\nIndied, Games that you will surely love!\n\n"

Well it could be\nthat it is part of the \u2018Hidden Job\u2019\nmarket. It is estimated that approximately\n70% of all vacancies filled have never been\nopenly advertised. This can be particularly\nprevalent for what are called \u2018experienced\nhire\u2019 opportunities but it can also be common\nin certain industry sectors at the graduate\nand intern level. So why are some jobs hidden\nlike this? Well there are several reasons.\nFirstly it takes time and money to advertise\njob opportunities so if your company is in\na sector that is highly sought after then you\nmight prefer to wait for potential candidates\nto come knocking on your door. For smaller\ncompanies who only recruit as and when the\nneed arises there might be a fear of being\nswamped if they make their opportunities\ntoo public. In some cases the work area is\nhighly specialised and so only a known group\nof people possess the right skill set so why\nlook further afield; and finally many jobs are\nfilled through contacts and networking, so it\nis all about who you know. So to maximise\nyour job hunting chances you need to take\ninto account this hidden factor as well as the\nmore openly advertised opportunities.\nSo how do you break into this\nmystery area?\nHere are four golden rules that will help you\nsucceed.\nResearch \u2013 It is important that you\nunderstand the normal recruitment methods\nfor the work you are trying to get into.\nDoes the sector almost always advertise\nor not? An easy way to find this out is by\nchecking regularly in all the normal sources\nfor vacancies such as newspapers, specialist\njournals, career websites, company websites\nand of course JobsLive. If you can\u2019t find what\nyou are looking for it does not necessarily\nmean it doesn\u2019t exist, it could just require\na little more effort and ingenuity to find it.\nYour careers consultant at College will be\nable to help you understand the norm for the\narea you are trying to get into so consider\nbooking an appointment to see the careers\nconsultant who works with your degree\ncourse. There is also useful information on\nthe www.prospects.ac.uk website Types of\nJobs section with details on a wide variety\nof occupational areas including information\nabout typical sources for vacancies. While\nyou are researching the work area it is\nimportant to understand what skills are\nrequired for the work as well because a big\npart of this type of job hunting involves\nselling your skills.\nSell your skills \u2013 Knowing what you have\nto offer is all important in the \u2018Hidden Job\u2019\nmarket. It will be down to you to understand\nhow your knowledge, experience and skills fit\nwith the work you are interested in, and then\nmarketing them in a way that is going to be\nirresistible to a potential employer. It is all\nabout showing what benefits you can bring\nto the organisation. Make sure when you\nare constructing your CV and covering letter\nthat you are highlighting all the right areas\nof expertise. Provide good clear evidence of\nwhat you can do; show that you understand\nwho they are and the work they are engaged\nin. The speculative cover letter needs to\ncapture their attention and leave them\nwanting to find out more about you. There is\nuseful information on writing cover letters at\nhttp://bit.ly/1aEIOFb.\nBe proactive \u2013 Planning your strategy is\nvital. Firstly, from your research, you need\nto create a target list of potential employers.\nThe more effort you put into this and the\nmore imaginatively you think about possible\nresources the more likely you are to come up\nwith a long target list unique to you. There\nare the obvious areas such as using internet\nsearches but you could also think about\nother resources. Specialist journals and\npublications have articles which may name\nkey players in the sector, who has recently\nbeen active in research, winning contracts,\ndeveloping innovation, collaborating with\nother companies etc. Some publications\nmay carry job adverts but they may also carry\nadverts for products or services and you can\nuse these as a way of researching companies\ntoo. If you know the sector you are interested\nin holds information/trade fairs these can\nalso be good ways to seek out company\ndetails.\nHaving put together your target list try\nto find a named contact. It always pays to\nsend a speculative letter or email to a specific\nperson. It is very easy to hit the delete\nbutton if you feel a message is not personally\naddressed to you but if it has your name at\nthe top human nature tends to make us much\nmore likely to reply. So check company web\npages where you will often find an \u2018about\nus\u2019 section which may include lists of key\npersonnel.\nThe next step is to decide how to approach\nthem. Here it pays to be subtle: the \u2018Give us\na job\u2019 up front attack does not always pay\noff. It can help to use a \u2018softly, softly\u2019 strategy\nwhere you build up some connection first.\nHave you got a reason to make contact? Are\nyou doing something on your course: an\nassignment, a project, some research that\nwould give you an opening? Sometimes\nasking for some help or information relating\nto your degree or research can provide\njust the right opportunity to develop a\nconnection further and you will be surprised\nhow often people will respond to this type\nof request for assistance. Then, having\nmade the connection, it is a lot easier to\nbuild this up step by step. You could ask\nfor a short meeting to find out more about\ntheir particular work area, advice on your\nCV, possibly a request to work shadow for\na day. Getting yourself known and having a\n\u2018foot in the door\u2019 are just the keys needed to\nunlocking this hidden market.\nNetwork and use your contacts \u2013 Making\nuse of your network is also essential and in\nthis type of job hunting it is all about building\nup that list of contacts. Make sure people\nknow what type of work you are interested\nin. You will be surprised how, in the course\nof general conversation, someone will know\nof someone else who happens to work in\nthat area. Also if you do make speculative\napproaches which are not successful always\nfollow up by asking if they happen to know\nsomeone else who you might contact. That\ngives you another name to add to your target\nlist and can also act as an introduction,\n\u201cx suggested I contact you about\u2026\u201d Use\nyour friends, parents, family, colleagues,\nacademics, family friends and all of their\ncontacts to spread you potential network and\nprovided you approach them diplomatically\nand politely this extended web of contacts\nwill prove to be a fantastic resource.

They have been on\nthe run for six years now, and FBI\nagent Robert Stansfield (Tommy Lee\nJones) tasked with keeping the family\nsafe is quite frankly sick of having to\nmove them around so much. \u201cTry to\nfit in, I\u2019m getting tired of finding you\na new place to live every 90 days\u201d\nhe says, and the newly named Blake\nfamily promise to behave themselves.\nThat is until the father beats up a\nplumber who is trying to rip him off,\nthe mother blows up a local grocery\nstore after getting insulted by snooty\nFrench people, the daughter attacks a\nsleazy boy with a tennis racquet, and\nthe son starts running a mini-Mafia\nring at his school.\nSound fun? It really isn\u2019t. Aside from\na few seconds of actual narrative flair\nthat signals some kind of direction or\npurpose, the film comes to an awful\nstandstill where characters mope\naround whilst trying to adjust to\ntheir new lives. There is the inevitable\nshowdown that must occur between\nthe \u201cBlakes\u201d and the wronged bad guys\nwho are on the hunt for the traitors,\nbut at a staggering 111-minute\nrunning time, you wonder whether\nthe Mafia could hurry up and get on\nwith tracking people down.\nHow do the Blakes pass their time\nin the meantime? Fred (De Niro)\nstarts writing a book \u2013 a memoir of\nsome sorts that he thinks will be a\ngood idea given his criminal past. The\nFBI agent wisely advises against this,\nbut to no avail. When Fred finds an\nold typewriter, he\u2019s an unstoppable\nliterary machine. Maggie (Pfeiffer)\ninvites people around for a barbecue,\nis a cooking queen, and finds peace\nby going to church. She confesses\nher sins to a priest. The priest is\nhorrified and tells her never to come\nback. What these supposed sins are\nthe audience never finds out, since\nthat actual confession itself is never\nshown. Belle (Agron) is about to\nexperience what it\u2019s like to fall in love\nwith the wrong man: a teacher. For\nsomeone her age, she\u2019s very misguided\nand frustratingly immature when it\ncomes to relationships, which marks\nthe weakest subplot of the lot. Warren\n(D\u2019Leo) doesn\u2019t really get up to much,\nalthough he does play a significant\npart in the film\u2019s most outrageous\nstrand that outlines the steps by which\nthe antagonists finally manage to track\nthis family down.\nDespite the cool, relaxed demeanour\nof De Niro, and the feisty energy from\nPfeiffer, The Family is a disappointingly\ndull feature that mistakes portraying\nutter empty boredom with inducing\nnostalgia. Is this a black comedy? A\nfamily drama? It\u2019s neither.\nThere are far better movies out there\nthat are based on the assassination of\nAmerican President John F. Kennedy.\nParkland may boast an impressive cast\nthe trailers have no trouble showing\noff, with the obligatory \u201cAcademy\nAward Winning\u201d or \u201cAcademy Award\nNominated\u201d slogans written above\nthe more famous names of the bunch\nheadlining the film. But what is the\npoint of having so many talented\nindividuals all cramped together in a\n90-minute running time without any\nof them given proper room to breathe\nwith their characters?\nIt must have sounded fantastic\non paper, which is probably how it\nmanaged to attract so much talent\nfor such an inadequate little film. The\nPresident\u2019s assassination is shown\nfrom various different angles, and\nhow this sudden turn of events starts\nto affect everyone. But the general\nconcensus is, everyone is shocked.\nEveryone is sad. And everyone is\ncrying. Watching the news on their\ntelevision screens, they can\u2019t believe\nwhat they\u2019re all witnessing. The tears\nstart pouring. Frankly that does very\nlittle for the audience.\nAs John F. Kennedy is rushed to\nParkland Memorial Hospital (hence\nthe film\u2019s title), he is met by Dr Charles\nJames Carrico (Zac Efron in a surgical\ngown \u2013 and no, I wouldn\u2019t want him\nto be my doctor either) who freaks out\nat first but then steps up to the biggest\nchallenge of his life and tries his best to\nsave POTUS with his limited medical\nexpertise. Help from Dr Malcolm O.\nPerry (Colin \u201cson of Tom\u201d Hanks)\ndoesn\u2019t improve the situation much,\nand it\u2019s no spoiler to reveal that he in\nfact, does not make it, which makes\nall the nurses cry. Oh, and Jacqueline\nKennedy (Kat Steffens), who has been\nleft a widow, cries too.\nThe Secret Service agents are angry.\nThey didn\u2019t see the attack coming and\nthey essentially collectively failed at\ndoingtheirjobs.RoyKellermann(Tom\nWelling) and Emory Roberts (Austin\nNichols) look all puffy and sulk on\nscreen, whereas Forrest Sorrels (Billy\nBob Thornton) gets down to business\ntrying to track down the man (Paul\nGiamatti) who inadvertantly filmed\nthe entire assassination on his camera,\nhoping to find some answers there.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) is in a state of mass panic as\nit comes to light that Lee Harvey\nOswald (Jeremy Strong), the man\nidentified as the shooter, was in fact\nin their offices a few days prior to the\nshooting. Oswald\u2019s threats weren\u2019t\ntaken seriously at the time by the Feds,\nwhich in light of recent events, would\nmake them look beyond incompetent.\nThey\u2019re scared, some evidence-burying takes place, although to what\nend we\u2019re never even shown.\nIt\u2019s a highly disjointed, confused film\nthat brings together several snapshots\nof various people\u2019s lives and leaving\nso many strands hanging. Very little\nconnection is made in between the\ncharacters, which is crucial in making\nsuch \u2018hyperlink\u2019 dramas work. This is\nLandesman\u2019s debut film, and with so\nmuch dense material and a large cast\nto juggle around with, it appears he is\nout of his depth with this one.\nThe only worthy subplot is one\ninvolving the assassin\u2019s family\nmembers. Robert Oswald (James\nBadge Dale), Lee Harvey\u2019s brother,\nis faced with an impossible situation\nwhen he and his family come under\nintense media spotlight. Looking at\nthis chaotic event from the family\u2019s\npoint of view offers an interesting\ndynamic for the film to play with.\nAs a family they want to stand by\nLee Oswald for his grave actions,\nbut on the other hand there is that\ncompletely relatable issue of difficulty\nin understanding his thought process.\nDale plays the most fascinating role in\nthe film thanks to having a lot more\ndeserved allocated screen time than\nhis co-stars, and when the excellent\nJacki Weaver enters the picture as\nthe unintentionally funny, delusional\nconspiracy theorist Margeurite\nOswald, the mother, this narrative\nstrand only gets better. Even though\nit\u2019s clear that Lee Oswald is the villain\nhere, there is something deeply sad\nand unsettling when it comes to what\nhis brother and mother have to face\nand what is left for them to clean up.\nA more intimate, focussed film\nconcentrating solely on the Oswalds\nwould have served this idea better.\nThere is so much distraction that even\nthe impact the best scene of the film\nshould have had is lost, which is a\nhuge letdown.\nWith so many ups and downs\nthroughout, it\u2019s a film that requires an\nenormous amount of patience, as you\nwill have to endure endless scenes of\nuseless characters faffing about.\nIs it all worth it in the end? Not really.\nYou\u2019ll be better served by watching\ndocumentaries or interviews.\n\n"

    "content": "14 FRIDAY 08 NOV\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhe recent cleaning response from\nCampus Services (see front page)\nindicates that some progress\nis being made in the \u2018cleaning\nsituation\u2019. However, one wonders\nwhy the department has taken so long to give\nan apology, even if they\u2019re only apologising\nfor taking so long to provide adequate\ninformation to all hall residents. Felix would\nstill like an answer to the list of questions we\nsent to them over seven days ago, we feel that\nthe students should be getting some proper\nanswers about the ways in which decisions\nwere made that have a strong impact of\ntheir wellbeing and studying experience.\nFelix knows about at least one student who\nlives on a room where cleaning was not\ncompleted during the second rotation of the\nschedule, leaving the student to have a room\nthat has only been cleaned once (so far) this\nterm. While it is true that mistakes can be\nmade (or possibly the room was particularly\nuntidy) did Campus Services think about the\nrepercussions it\u2019s actions would have on the\nstudents, and indeed had the potential for\nthese changes ever been discussed prior to\nthe re-tender?\nImperial has recently signed up to the\nRenaissance Engineering Programme with\nthe Singaporean Nanyang Technological\nUniversity. The program is shaped to create\na kind-of engineering polymath, with bright\nstudents being educated in engineering,\nscience, technology, business, economics,\nand entrepreneurship (College Joins NTU\nRenaissance Engineering Programme,\npage 3). This progressive programme seems\nlike a fantastic opportunity for the students\nwho will be selected and may leave some\ncurrent students wishing they were only a few\nyears younger...\nOh, ULU, whatever next?\nAs you may have heard in last week\u2019s\nnational papers, the President of the\nUniversity of London Union, Michael\nChessum was arrested the day after a\nprotest he organised on University property.\nFollowing the controversy over Summer,\nwhere the University of London banned\nstudents from protesting on some areas of\nUniversity property (see FelixOnline.co.uk on\nAug 7th bit.ly/17S1ZrM), it seems as though\nthe Union chose to ignore this warning\nwhile protesting about it\u2019s immenent closure\nat the end of this academic year. While it is\nimportant that students stand up for their\nviews, the low turnouts for ULU elections\nand the decent size of the UoL constituent\nCollege Unions, some might see the closue\nof ULU and the repurposing of its building\nby the University as a progessive move that\nmight improve the efficiency of services for\nstudents.\nJoseph Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nOf cleaning (still),\npartnerships and Chessums\nLetters\nTo whom it may concern,\nI enjoy reading the articles on the paper\nbut ever since I realised that you put a\ndouble spread of really disrespectful\nmaterial in it I stopped. I think this\ncan be better replaced with many\ndifferent things, like a spread on some\ndetails of a country with interviews\nfrom people originating from there,\nwhich I would be happy to help; and I\nknow hundreds of students who want\nthis to be removed as well, I can give\nyou a list of their names if you want;\nand I believe that if we take this out\nthen the newspaper would be more\nhighly regarded amongst the seniors\nand visiting researchers and anyone\nelse who reads it expecting to read\ninteresting facts about Imperial. If you\nhave any questions please let me know\nand I hope to hear from you soon.\nThanks and regards,\n[Name Withheld] x\nDear Sir,\nThank you for getting in touch with your concerns.\nI always enjoy reading letters. I await your petition\nwith interest, it\u2019s always nice to get feedback (unless\nyou want to wait for our feedback survey?). -Ed.\nDearest Felix Editor,\nPerhaps my insults towards this bum of\nthe forest [The Druid, see last week] were\na bit exaggerated. He seems to be quite a\nnice chap (aside ice cream addiction). I\nagree that we should combine the might\nof the light and the power of nature to\nmake the Union a better place for all.\nHis point about fish is quite astute, and\nI beg you, dearest Felix editor, look\ninto this matter. Furthermore I would\nlike to complain about the state of the\nbathrooms in the Union. Recently I was\nrelieving myself (taking a dump), and\nthere was no toilet paper! Imagine my\nhorror! I had to use the might of light\nto cleanse myself! Please inform those\nresponsible that I shall be cursing them.\nYours Sincerely,\nThe Paladin\nAre you guys serious? Well, just on the off-chance you\nare you\u2019ll probably want to write a paper to the Union\u2019s\nExec Board (in charge of operations). I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll\nrespond to your problems with the treatment you\ndeserve... - Ed.\nDisrespectful Material\nAn Apology to Felix Copy Editors & Centrefold Members\nDuring the production of last week\u2019s paper, due to a change in circumstances (which also led to a reduction in the number of pages),\nthe paper was printed without the changes made by the Copy Editors. Felix would like to officially apologise for the misspent hours the\nCopy Editors lost while trying to improve the standard of the paper. This week all edits have been included, providing a better reading\nexperience for both the readers and the Copy Editors.\nWe would also like top apologise to the students in last week\u2019s Centrefold, who took part in a distinctly off-centre centrefold. We hope to\nreprint the centrefold in a distinctly more central position later on in the year.\nFelix.\nDon\u2019t be afraid,\nthe Cat doesn\u2019t bite! If you have something on your\nmind, want to share your opinion with the world,\nwant to write about the last gig, play, movie or\ngame you experienced, have an interesting news\nstory to share with us, fancy yourself as the next\nAlan Sugar or just simply like to make illustrations,\nmake sure to send an email to us at:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nNo experience necessary, honest.\n\n"

Eat it instead\nWaffle Facts\nThis is not your average waffle shop.\nWafflemeister boasts a secret Belgian\nrecipe which dates back to the 1950s.\nThe freshly made waffles are topped\nwith a range of toppings, from Belgian\nchocolate fudge and freshly whipped\ncream to fresh fruit and natural gelato.\nWafflemeister is all about delivering a\nhigh quality waffle \u2013 their promise is:\n\u201cIt takes a lot of hard work, continuous\ntraining and dedication to become\na Meister. The Wafflemeister takes\ngreat pride in providing high quality,\nfresh and great tasting products\nwhich do not contain GM ingredients,\nartificial flavourings, colourings or\npreservatives.\u201d\nHow is it different from\nits competition?\n1. Online delivery service to\nbe launched in December which will\noffer same day delivery or next day\ndelivery UK wide.\n2. 15% Discount to students at\nImperial College London.\n3. Loyalty Programme: Bronze,\nSilver and Gold. This gives you access\nto a large range of deals and offers,\nwith increasing benefits as you go\nfrom bronze to silver to gold.\nThe \u2018meister\u2019 in Wafflemesister,\nfounded by Alex Troullier, means in\nGerman \u2018a dedicated craftsman who\nis passionate about his trade\u2019. I spoke\nwith Alex to find out more:\nQ: Tell me about yourself.\nI was born in Switzerland and grew up\nin Canada, Germany and Spain. I did\nan MBA at Imperial and have business\nexperience setting up, for example, a\ncompany that imported vitamins. I\nthen decided to go into the retail space\nduringmyMBA,settinguptheBelgian\nFood Company (BFC), for which I\nopened 2 branches, one in Oxford\nStreet, the other in Baker Street. In\n2000, just after I graduated, I got an\noffer in finance, so I sold my shares\nin BFC and went into Finance for ten\nyears. This involved working with\nprivate equity, hedge funds and capital\nraising. After a decade in finance, I\nwent back to the waffle space because\nI missed waffles and for some reason it\nhad a soft spot with me. I bought back\nBFC from the current owners who had\nneglected it as they had also brought\na publishing company in Dubai. They\nwere very happy to sell the company\nback to me and I set about revamping\nand repositioning it within the market\nspace. Some of the factors which I\nthought were important were to focus\non handmade, homemade waffles\nusing natural ingredients (organic\nwhen possible), redesigning and\nrebranding the business. I opened\nbranches in South Kensington and\nPortobello road market and supply\nHarvey Nichols in Knightsbridge with\nwaffles.\nQ: Why did you set up a waffle\nbusiness and what is your vision of\nWafflemeister for the future?\nI have always been passionate about\ngoodtastingfood,whetheritissavoury\nor dessert. When I set up the business,\napart for the conventional sandwich\nbar and the occasional crepe shop, for\nexample \u2018My Old Dutch\u2019, there was not\nmuch choice. Even to this day no one\nreally does great waffles apart from us\nand there is no real brand ownership.\nMy vision is that we will own this\nspace; when people think of waffles\nthey think of Wafflemeister, whether\nthis is in retail where you walk into\nthe store, online where you get it\ndelivered or hopefully in the future,\nsupermarkets. We will also hope to sell\nfrozen waffle dough, where people can\npurchase their own waffle iron so they\ncan bake waffles themselves and have\nthat fun experience. We have opened\nup Wafflemeister branches in Abu\nDhabi and Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Petronas\ntwin towers through franchises and\nwill expand to Dubai next February.\nWe hope to have opened ten stores\nglobally by the end of the year and 20\nstores by the end of next year.\nQ: Can you give me some insight\ninto your personal experience of the\nMBA programme at Imperial?\nThis was a very positive experience for\nme. One thing that stood out the most\nto me was the case studies. I did an\nexecutive MBA where I had a full time\njob as well as committing to studies.\nThis flexibility meant I did not have to\nput any of my goals on hold, and was\nable to carry on with what I wanted\nto do simultaneously. It was a great\nexperience to work under pressure as\npart of a international team, to meet\ndeadlines which were set.\nQ. What advice can you give to\nstudents interested in enterprise?\nIt is important that students know\nexactly what they want to achieve, how\nto get there and have them written\ndown. Don\u2019t make the list too long\nas, just simple points, as the \u2018to do\u2019\nlist can get too long sometimes. The\nhard work you put into achieving your\ngoals will pay off, be it finishing your\ndegree or starting your own business.\nNow that winter has arrived, next\ntime when you are hungry, why not\npop by Wafflemeister for a warm\nwaffle?\nWant to show off your\nculinary skills?\nAre you a budding cook or a first timer?\nCooking for your flatmates or going alone?\nWell, share the photos of your lovely meal on\nTwitter and Instagram and hashtag it with\n#FelixFood.\nIt (and perhaps your recipe) could appear on Felix!\nOr why not write for Food?

ConTaCTs\nsTuDenTs abouT Cleaning error\nJOSEPH LETTS\nLast week Felix reported on College\nCampus Services\u2019 decisions to\nchange the campus cleaning services\nduring a re-tendering of the cleaning\ncontract. It transpired that one of\nthe department\u2019s decisions included\nreducing the frequency of cleaning\nin bedrooms and communal areas, at\none stage justifying this by explaining\nthis had enabled the potential more\nfrequent cleaning of other areas such\nas Ethos and the Library Caf\u00e9.\nHowever, many students in halls\nhave been upset by the way in\nwhich the changes were handled, in\nparticular the mistakes make with\nthe accommodation licence. Even\nthough the decisions may have been\nsigned during Summer, because\nCampus Services neglected to update\nthe contract, many students feel as\nthough they have signed up for a more\nfrequent cleaning service than they\ncurrently receive.\nAfter our article on Friday, residents\nreceived a better explanation of the\nsituation from Campus Services\nvia email this Tuesday. The email is\nreplicated (as is) below:\n\u201cDear Hall Residents,\nThis summer the College-wide\ncleaning contract was re-tendered for\nthe first time in over seven years. As a\nresult, we now receive a more specific\nand flexible service for the same cost.\nIn response to feedback from students,\nCampus Services used this opportunity\ntomakechangestothecleaning services\nprovided in halls of residence as well\nas across other College facilities that\nwe operate for students and staff. These\nchanges were not made to cut costs and\nwe will always aim to provide a high\nstandard of cleaning to our residents.\nThe changes:\nBedrooms are cleaned once a month\nand more thoroughly. Kitchens are\nnow cleaned three days per week,\nincluding once on a Saturday. The bins\nstill continue to be emptied daily and\nrecycling bins are emptied according to\nlocal council collection rotas (usually\n3-4 times per week).\nFollowing these changes we have\nbeen consulting with Imperial College\nUnion on how else to improve hall\ncleaning provisions. As a result we\nare in the process of making cleaning\nequipment readily available in every\nhall and we encourage students\nto make use of them as and when\nrequired. Information posters in every\nkitchen will inform students of their\nlocation and will include details on\nlocal arrangements for cleaning and\nbin collection.\nAll of the changes are being monitored\nand we will shortly be conducting a\nreview in co-operation with Imperial\nCollege Union and halls committees to\nensure the current service is adequate.\nOur priority is providing an effective\ncleaning service and we will continue\nto modify the service where this is not\nthe case.\nThere has been some concern over\nthe College Accommodation Licence\n(2013-2014) which includes details of\nthe previous cleaning arrangements in\nhalls. Because of tight timescales, the\nclause referring to these arrangements\nwas not amended, however this was\na genuine error. We apologise for not\ncontacting you earlier about these\nchanges.\nThe Accommodation Licence is rarely\nchanged ? and before there are any\nchanges in the future Campus Services\nwill work closely with the ViceProvost (Education), the Director of\nStudent Support and Imperial College\nUnion to establish the best approach\nfor consultation and to ensure any\nchanges are effectively communicated\nto students....\n\u201d\nWhile the Campus Services\ndepartment has admitted to making\nan error while handling the cleaning\ncontract, for many students this last\nmessage leaves so many questions\nunanswered. There has still been no\nmention of the legality of continuing\nthe current cleaning service, given\nthat the Accommodation License\nthat binds halls residents and College\nstates that rooms will be cleaned\nweekly instead of monthly.\nHowever, a positive note in this issue\nhas been that during consultation\nScreenshot of the\nweek. 29\nMars MAVEN Launch\nUS Mars Atmosphere and Volatile\nEvolutioN shuttle launches\n10\nOpen Minds\nExposing the issue of\nmental health\n8\ncontinued on page 3...\n\n"

So\nhaving been to most national\nparks and game reserves in Kenya,\nwe finally decided to venture next\ndoor to the fellow Swahili-speaking\nnation that is Tanzania, home of the\nfamous Serengeti National Park.\nFor two neighbouring countries\nthat share the same language and\ncurrency, the difference between\nthem is certainly startling: Kenya\nhas long been the commercial and\neconomic hub of East Africa, whereas\nTanzania is one of the poorest\ncountries in the world. Tanzania has,\nhowever, been spared the internal\nstrife that has blighted many African\nstates. Indeed, the remains of some\nof the earliest traces of humanity,\nincluding the legendary two million-year-old Australopithecus habilis,\nwere found in Tanzania\u2019s Olduvai\nGorge, one of the world\u2019s most\nimportant paleoanthropological sites.\nTanzania is an extremely large\ncountry, approximately four times the\nsize of Britain. Our journey began in\nKenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, from where\nwe drove south to the border town\nNamanga, before crossing the border\ninto Tanzania and stopping in Arusha.\nFrom here we finally met our guide\nand driver, the wonderfully-named\nEzekiel Mwanza, who was going to be\nwith us for the duration of the safari.\nOur first port of call was Lake\nManyara National Park, famous for its\ntree-climbing lions who love nothing\nmore than acacia trees. Unfortunately\nwe didn\u2019t manage to see any, but we\nwere blessed with plenty of other\nbeautiful wildlife. From here we\nheaded to the Ngorongoro Crater,\na national park in itself, measuring\na whopping 264 square kilometres.\nNext was a seemingly endless seven\nhour drive north to Lobo National\nPark, and finally two days at the\nSerengeti National Park. Serengeti\ntranslates from Maasai as \u2018endless\nplains\u2019, quite an apt name for a park\ncovering 14,750 square kilometres.\nThe Maasai Mara in Kenya and\nthe Serengeti play host to one of the\nmost spectacular events on Earth:\nthe migration of over one-and-a-half-This photo caption is so boring that even this hungry lioness is dropping off. Get back to the articles.\nmillion white-bearded wildebeest and\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand zebra,\nfor which numerous Nile crocodile\neagerly await in the rivers nearby.\nThe sheer amount of wildlife we saw\nwas staggering. Casually witnessing\nfourteen sleeping lionesses, sated\nfrom their recent meal together, was\nso special. Leopards are allegedly\none of the most elusive of creatures\naround: not only did we see one, but\nwe saw it casually climbing a tree!\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate truth that the\nMaasai Mara is now suffering the\neffects of mass-tourism, in contrast to\na trip across the border, where policy\nis focused on conservation as opposed\nto profiteering. A trip to Tanzania is\nvery expensive for a foreigner, and\nthe prices don\u2019t even have a concept\nof a low season. One of the guides\nremarked that \u201cTanzania has the\nbetter parks, but Kenya has better\nmarketing\u201d. Everyone we met was from\nmainlandEurope.Tanzaniahassixteen\nnational parks, 29 game reserves,\nand 40 controlled conservation areas\nand marine parks. One of particular\nnote is Gombe National Park, where\none can go chimpanzee trekking.\nAll in all, the trip was absolutely\nfantastic. For those with an\ninclination to go on a safari\nanytime soon: head to Tanzania.\nAnd swing by Kenya, obviously.\nTravel! ...And other narcotics\nPablo Col\u00f3n\nT\nravel is, in so many ways,\na powerful drug. This\nresemblance is one that\nI\u2019ve always considered,\nand the analogy seems\nto hold true with respect to most\nof travel\u2019s traits, except perhaps for\nthe fact that you can\u2019t physically\nsniff travel through a crisp fifty\nafter crushing it with a credit card.\nPeople who have never travelled\nwill never properly understand the\nconcept and, as with drugs, tend\nto fall into two camps: those who\ncan see the appeal but for whatever\nreason haven\u2019t pursued it, and those\nwho dismiss the notion as a waste of\nenergy, time, and money. To attempt\nto explain it to the outsider is an\nexercise in futility. That\u2019s not to say\nthat it\u2019s some exclusive club, but\nrather something that people should\nexperience for themselves in order\nto draw their own conclusions with\nMDMA from some sub-par Silk Road\nvendor, there\u2019s always the occasional\nbackpacker who contracts dengue\nfever or ends up having to bribe their\nway out of a situation in which they\u2019ve\ndone nothing wrong, but on the\nThe rush that punches you in the\nface when you touchdown, with a\nridiculous number of days and miles\nahead of you, is very much a physical\nsensation, a sort of coming-up. There\u2019s\nthe strange adjustment period as\nwhen it\u2019s all over too soon make you\nimpulsively hunt for your next hit.\nIt\u2019s also a pretty expensive habit,\nbut one that you can justify the costs\nfor on the basis that it\u2019s too much\nfun, and something you probably\nwon\u2019t be able to do once you\u2019re all\ngrown up and in the real world.\nUnless you\u2019re a part of that rare breed\nwho wants to maintain the habit\nwell into adulthood and retirement.\nTravel brings together people from\nallwalks,andprovidestheopportunity\nfor them to go a little bit crazy and\ngenerate some stories that probably\nwon\u2019t ever be told to the grandkids.\nIt\u2019s something that everyone should\nexperience \u2013 before diving soul-first into the nearest hedge fund or\nstrategy boutique \u2013 and something\nthat offers at least some solace in what\nare otherwise, sadly, pretty dark times.\n\u201cthe analogy seems to hold true \u2026 except perhaps for the\nas few preconceptions as is possible.\nThose fortunate enough to be\nacquainted with travel typically\nregard it as a positive, life-changing\nexperience.

After working all those hours\nto be hit with the striking realisation\nthat I did not, in fact, understand\nthe topic even a little bit caused me\nto doubt many a life decision. I also\ncame to doubt my native English\nfollowing one particularly bad exam\nwhere I distinctly remember no verbs\nin the first two sentences. But never\ndid I consider what happened to that\nstack of papers the GTAs insisted on\ncounting for five minutes at least 12\ntimes after the end of the exam.\nI was asked to mark one of my\nclass\u2019s mid-term tests, the standard\n\u2018Oh, but we want you to understand\nyour progress, nothing to worry\nabout, but since you are all here it\ncan be a horrifically weighted piece of\ncoursework that you might fail\u2019 kind\nof thing. This was finally my chance to\nget revenge. I would be one of those\nawful GTAs that wrote nothing in\nfeedback and in general gave marks\nlower than your wildest imagination.\nWhat I did not expect to hit me\nwas compassion. I have taught these\nstudents for two months now. I\nhave struggled alongside them with\ntechniques they will probably never\nuse again... ever. I even sat with them\nin the exam and tried not to stand\nbehind them or take too long to count\nthe scripts at the end. I found myself\nrejoicing in their success, in those\nbeautiful but startlingly rare papers\nwhich were close to the mark scheme\nand extraordinarily correct.\nThese were, however, the unicorn\npapers that were like a needle in\na haystack or really just a stack.\nMore commonly, I was assaulted by\nadditional issues and, finally, broken\nhearted by being unable to read\nwhat people had written. This was\nfrustrating. We would get halfway\nthrough a problem and suddenly it\nbecame a maze of lines and artistic but\nillegible squiggles and nearly always,\nalways, wrong at the end. I couldn\u2019t\nhelp them and pull them back from\nthe oblivion of failure simply because\nI had no idea what was going on. 4s\nsuddenly appeared or disappeared\nseemingly at random or life became\nsome sort of integration with no limits\nor possible answer.\nI know I was never a unicorn,\nbut the shining lights for me were\nthose people who admitted their\nweaknesses. A simple note to say I\nhave forgotten the definition of sinh.\nI have assumed it is this. Or I think\nit went wrong here. These were the\npeople that got the method marks as\nwere those who had bad handwriting\nbut spread everything out. I could save\nthese people.\nSo at two in the morning, having\nlost the will to live, wondering what in\nheck did I teach these people, a GTA\ndoes not expect to see a unicorn, but a\nnicely laid out paper with the mistakes\nclearly marked. This was the Holy\nGrail.\nConfessions of a GTA: Part 6\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\nW\nhat could\npossibly link\nAngelina Jolie\nand the first\nfemale President\nof Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike\nKumaratunga? Why William Hague\nand last week\u2019s Commonwealth\nsummit, of course! There has been a\nbizarre image occasionally popping up\nover the past few months, of a rather\nsmitten MP standing beside Angelina\nJolie talking about the horrors of rape\nand abuse that women suffer the\nworld over. The most striking image I\nhave of Kumaratunga is, perhaps, less\ncomical: she had made a speech in\nColombo brutally criticising the mass\nmurder and war crimes committed\nby the Sri Lankan government in the\nclosing stages of the \u2018war\u2019 against the\nTamil \u2018Tigers\u2019. I never expected to\nhear a former head of state claim to\nbe ashamed at being from the country\nthey served but these were the words\nthat came from Kumaratunga\u2019s mouth.\nYet somehow, poor old Willy has\nforgotten Angie\u2019s campaign and\nis going to the Commonwealth\nsummit held in Sri Lanka. Forget\nthe \u2018allegations\u2019 of war crimes, of\nmass rape, of the murder of women,\nchildren and civilians, by the Sri\nLankan government since well before\ntheir culmination in the atrocities\nof 2011. Forget the videos of mass\nexecution and war crimes in the\nChannel 4 Documentary: Sri Lanka\u2019s\nKilling Fields \u2013 one of those rare\nexamples of journalistic integrity that\nrenews your faith in the free press.\nThe video may have been verified by\nthe UN, but forget that, the Sinhalese\ngovernment claims that it is a forgery.\nThat clearly settles the matter.\nYes, once again, the British\ngovernment has distinguished itself\nin its concern for alleged human\nrights abuses. But a boycott, no. That\nwould be unthinkable and damaging.\nIt is only through discussion, talk,\nand trade (especially trade), that we\ncan encourage governments to act\nin a humane way. If I recall correctly,\nsimilar arguments were made by\nanother respected Tory leader, and her\nAmerican counterpart, apropos some\nother backwards regime\u2026 What was\nit again? Apartheid South Africa? I\nthink there must be something wrong\nthere but I can\u2019t quite figure out what.\nWell regardless, we must let history be\nthe judge.\nGetting back to the point; should\nwe really, however, see the spate of\nboycotts as a positive sign? Although I\nwould suggest it is idiotic to complain\nthat, as one online headline put it,\nthe Indian boycott was made for\nPolitical Reasons (what reasons, pray,\nwere you expecting?), and though\nCanada\u2019s motivations are probably\nrelatively benign (the large Tamil ex-pat population will also have played\na factor), we should really never be\nsatisfied with the stories politicians\nlike to tell about themselves. PM\nManmohan Singh may well care\ndeeply for \u2018Commonwealth values\u2019, but\nthe continued and sinister movements\nmade by the Indian government\nagainst the Naxalite rebels has some\ndisturbing parallels with the Sinhalese\ncampaign against the Tamil Tigers\nbefore 2011. More likely, Singh felt the\npressure of the large Tamil population\n(and elements of government) in\nIndia. If this was all, India\u2019s intentions\nwould still be largely honourable \u2013 we\noften seem to forget that listening to\nthe will of the people is essentially\ndemocratic and there is little wrong\nin principle if a politician serves that\npeople instead of his or her own ideas\nand beliefs.\nThis is, however, not all. Is it\ncoincidence that the Mauritian PM\njoined the boycott? Mauritius (along\nwith Madagascar and the Seychelles)\nhas recently seen a lot of Indian\ninterest. India needs to protect its\ntrade ships against the resurgent\nphenomenon of piracy, and these\nislands make ideal bases to do so. Well,\nthere is that and the fact that India\nhas steadily been losing out as far as\nimperial and geopolitical dominance\nin the Indian Ocean is concerned.\nChina\u2019s String of Pearls strategy has\nbeen remarkably effective, isolating\nIndia and restricting its sphere of\ninfluence. And the Koh-i-Noor in that\nstring of pearls? You guessed it: Sri\nLanka.\nFor instance, what does a largely\nBuddhist and Islamic country like\nSri Lanka need with a $400 million\ncasino? Nothing, but the growing\nChinese and Indian middle classes\ncould do with entertainment when\nthey visit the tropical paradise. It is\njust a pity that it is in the middle of\na civil war\u2026 Oh wait! With a Reuters\nreport estimating a further $2.5 billion\na year from tourism alone (a modest\n5% of GDP, something equivalent to\n$750 billion dollars in the US, or put\ndifferently, the entire US bailout fund),\nSri Lanka needs to prepare itself to\ncater for all those nouveau riche.\nOr take the fancy new Lotus tower:\nit will be 350m upon completion,\ndwarfing the Shard, and funded out of\nthe goodwill of the People\u2019s Republic\nof China. The Sri Lankan\u2019s benefit,\nthe Indian tourists benefit and the\nChinese benefit. Everybody is happy!\nExcept the Tamils. With the mass\nmurders of 2011, further claims for\nindependence are unlikely to be top\npriority for the people of Northern\nSri Lanka. Especially considering the\nimmediate future holds nothing but\ngrim prospects. Manmohan Singh\nhimself inaugurated the dredging of\nthe ancient Ram Sethu Canal, trying\nto make the Tamil Nadu area of India a\n\u201crival for [the now destitute] Detroit\u201d.\nThe toxic effects on the ecosystem\nare probably of secondary concern\nto Singh, particularly since the one of\nthe worst groups to be affected will\nbe Tamils living in coastal areas of\nSri Lanka, where small scale fishing is\nan intrinsic part of everyday survival.\nMeanwhile the great \u2018benefits\u2019 of\nChinese investment have come at\na bitter price to the Tamil people\n(assuming that the effective North/\nSouth divide doesn\u2019t prevent the even\nspread of new wealth as it always has\ndone in the past). Is it coincidence that\nthe $4 billion worth of infrastructure\nprojects and the new deep trade-links\ncame after China sold Sri Lanka the\nweapons needed for the victory over\nthe um, terrorist, children?\nThe only surprise in all this is that\nIndia bothered to boycott at all. It\nseems clear that they care very little\nabout the Sri Lankan Tamils, and a\nshort term spat with the teardrop\nisle may well lead to an entrenched\nChinese position which India cannot\ndesire in its small neighbour. The\npressure from Tamil politicians may\nbe considerable, though we doubt it\ncan be important for a government\nso notoriously corrupt and which has\nsuch blatant imperialist ambitions.\nThe general consensus is that India\nis only damaging its international\nposition by boycotting this meeting,\nso what could be the motivation? It\ncould be that the internal situation\nin India is even more desperate than\ncommentators seem to think. Or could\nthese whispers of a new ChineseIndian trade deal I am hearing have\nanything to do with it? Common\nwealth? Somehow, I think not.\nSince when was wealth common?\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nAfter marking 56 papers we become a bit overdramatic\n\n"

There\u2019s a price to pay for\neverything.\u201d\nThe words of Aodh\u00e1n Madine, my\nfather, once spoken flippantly, now\ntouch a raw nerve. Time has passed and\nthey\u2019re like daggers, sharpened by the\nwhetstone of the crash.\nWe were happy back then. Through\nthe untarnished eyes of infancy my\nfamily\u2019s fortunes seemed promising.\nGlimpses of things to come were bathed\nin the deep tones of Dad\u2019s voice, like\nstars in the ether.\n***\nJanuary \u201894 was my fifth birthday. I\nremember it vividly. Dad had taken my\nelder brother Joe and I out for a drive.\nPerched beside him in his clapped out\nFord Transit we gazed out at the barren\nbuilding site. I\u2019ll never forget his smile\nas he pulled up by the curb. It was one\nof unadulterated relief, stretching from\near to ear.\n\u201cYour Dad\u2019s building twenty houses\nhere. It\u2019ll keep dinner on the table for\nthe next while\u201d\n, said Dad.\nHe put the van in gear and pulled\naway while Joe and I fell back into childish nonchalance, playing \u2018I Spy\u2019 as we\nweaved through the labyrinth of Dublin\nstreets.\nBack then the Madine household was\nlively. We moved after Dad\u2019s building\nfirm took off. \u2018A. M. Construction\u2019 was\ngathering strength. He was never out of\nthat van. Joe and I would ask over the\nbreakfast table, \u201cWhere are you building\nhouses today, Da?\u201d He\u2019d reply, \u201cLucan,\nboys\u201d or, \u201cSandymount, lads\u201d\n. He had\nsigns up all over Dublin with embossed\nletters that read: \u201cA. M. Construction \u2013\nGetting the Job Done\u201d\n. Mammy used to\ntell us that he was off to build a cage for\nthe Celtic Tiger.\nI find it haunting that some of those\nsigns still hang in tatters, nineteen years\nlater.\n***\nWe arrived home. Heaving me up\nonto his shoulders, he ran up the driveway and through the open front door,\nwith Joe giving chase. The house was\npeppered with boxes crammed with\nour things, like parcelled promises of\nlife to come. We moved through to the\nkitchen. A horde was gathered around\nthe table.\n\u201cThere\u2019s Sarah\u201d\n, said Dad, kissing my\nmother on the cheek. Granda Michael\nwas there with outstretched arms to\nreceive Joe and I. Dan Harrington,\nDad\u2019s business partner, looked on with\na smile, as did Mickey Bishop, his best\nfriend. His billowing black moustache\ngleamed in the half-light. Joe and I were\nmesmerised by my birthday cake with\nits five flickering candles standing proud\nand tall.\nLater that evening, briefly stirring\nfrom the joy of the celebrations, I ventured back into the kitchen. The adults\nwere gathered around the table in animated conversation. I was hit by a number of sensations: the shadows dancing across their faces; the veracity with\nwhich they held one another\u2019s gaze; and\nmost strikingly, the rumbling tone of\ntheir voices.\n\u201cYou\u2019re onto something big, Aodh\u00e1n\u201d\n,\nsaid Mickey Bishop. My father began\nto stare wistfully into space. \u201cJaysus, I\ncould pocket two-hundred thousand\npunt\u201d\n, he whispered.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to sign the Lucan deal by\nMonday and maybe the whole lot\u201d\n, said\nDan. Mammy joined in. \u201cSure the bank\nsaid they\u2019ll approve any loans you\u2019ll\nneed.\u201d\nFor a fleeting instant I caught Granda\u2019s\neye. They were moist with tears as he\nspoke. \u201cSign it Aodh\u00e1n. Give your boys\nthe comforts I could never afford to give\nyou. The Madines deserve a break. It\u2019s\nour time.\u201d\nMammy turned and saw me. She carried me upstairs and had me ready for\nbed in an instant.\nI loved my room. My bed was in the\ncorner beneath a skylight embedded in\nthe ceiling. The stars glistened in the\ndeep blue azure of night. Sleep enveloped me. My eyes began to flicker as I\nstared into this hypnotic tapestry. One\nof my closing thoughts was of how the\nstars, like majestic sentinels, watched\nover all the children of Ireland\u2026 and I\nthought of how the phosphorescence\nof Granda\u2019s tears looked just like those\nstars. They appeared as one and the\nsame thing, curators of hope and of\ndreams.\n***\nThe years wore on. Each cycle of the\ncalendar saw the promise of the last\ndwarfed by that of the next. Ireland\u2019s\ndestiny became enmeshed with the\nprosperity of the times, woven into a\nsingle fabric that we hoped had no end.\nHouses, roads and bridges flashed\ninto existence as the country was enveloped in an economic mirage. Dad\u2019s\nwork went with this rushing tide. During those years the house was in an eternal state of flux. Workmen came and\nwent, trailing a veil of dust in their wake\nas rhythmically as day and night.\nI\u2019d rush home from school in the evenings in anticipation of the surprises\nand changes awaiting me. Initially they\nwere subtle, like fresh coats of paint on\nthe walls or a new vase for the dining\nroom. In time they became magnified\nand exuberant, at least in the eyes of my\nbrother and I. One balmy spring evening we rounded the corner of our Avenue and stopped dead in our tracks. Dad\nwas waxing a new BMW. With its opu-lent, black body and tapered exhaust it\nrendered Joe aghast. It fuelled my imagination for many weeks. I christened\nit \u2018The Bat Mobile\u2019 there and then. Dad\nreplied, \u201cGood man\u201d\n, before grinning\nand patting me on the head.\nThat evening my thoughts became\nsinister. Gazing through my skylight the\nnight revealed itself. Dad had scolded\nme for bursting into his office. He\u2019d been\nsitting nestled behind his desk with his\nglasses perched on the bridge of his\nnose. He scrutinised numbers of impressive length inscribed in a thick ledg-er. A sole desk lamp provided the only\nlight in the room. Squat piles of money\nwere neatly arranged on the table. He\nlaced the notes back and forth between\nhis fingers as though in a trance. He\nwhispered as he counted with his face\nheld taut in a concentrated grimace.\nWhen he looked up his face went\nlimp. His expression was a rich complex\nof surprise and hostility. Even as an eight\nyear old boy I could deduce a veneer of\nembarrassment\u2026even shame. It was\nbarely perceptible but it was there.\n\u201cOut now Shane\u201d\n, said Dad. His voice\ncut through me like a knife through but-ter. I turned to leave but hesitated, compelled to be defiant.\nSquarely holding his gaze I turned his\nfamiliar phrase back on him, \u201cThere\u2019s a\nprice to pay for everything, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\nHe hurdled the desk and raised his\nhand before I could blink. It stopped\nshort. He became as still as a statue. The\ncolour drained from his cheeks as he\nspoke. His voice was as cold and piercing as his stare: \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to\ndecide whether you\u2019re incredibly bright\nor incredibly stupid.\u201d\nHis pallor returned on a reinvigor-ated wave of rage. The crisp notes were\nbunched between his fingers as he\nyelled, \u201cOut!\u201d I burst into tears. He took\nme in his arms. I remember him whispering to me as he carried me from the\noffice, \u201cI\u2019m just tired. I didn\u2019t mean it\nShane\u2026did I?\u201d\nHis animated voice later drifted up\nthe stairs. Mammy reproached him\nfor losing his cool. I heard the rustle\nof leather as he settled in his chair. He\nsighed and spoke. \u201cLook at that money\non the table Sarah. It doesn\u2019t look right,\nlike it shouldn\u2019t be there. More and\nmore keeps coming in\u2026but sure, everybody\u2019s at it. I often question whether\nthat makes it right. Then I remember\nhow I\u2019ve broken my back since 1988\u2026\nfor you, for the boys. Shane was right.\nEverything has its price.\u201d\nHe fell quiet. Mammy broke the si-lence, \u201cAodh\u00e1n, he\u2019s only a child...\u201d Dad\ncut in. \u201cI hope he learns one thing. In\nthis day and age ask no questions. You\ngo forward or you fail.\u201d\nAs I rolled over in bed I willed sleep\nto come. You go forward or you fail. His\nwords seemed defamatory back then.\nJesus, if he knew what was coming\u2026\n***\nJoe and I were always close. We loved\ncars. Joe would idle away the weekends\nstaring vacantly at Dad\u2019s BMW. With\nhis legs tucked under him he\u2019d crawl\nbeneath its aggressive bulk, combing\nevery inch of its garrulous opulence.\nDad used to humour him and say, \u201cShe\u2019s\nworth every one of the thirty thousand\ninvested in her, Joe.\u201d\nWhenever he mentioned money I\u2019d\nlose interest, as though by linking the\ncar to reality its magic was dispersed.\nAt this juncture I\u2019d jump on my bike\nand cycle around town, often passing\nthrough one of Dad\u2019s building sites as\nthe lifeless shells of innumerable houses\nmerged and blurred. With my heart\nbooming I\u2019d return and collapse on the\nfront lawn, taking pride in my exer-tion. I never touched the brakes. One\nafternoon Dad forced a helmet on me.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a price to pay for everything\u201d\n, he\nsaid knowingly, staring me down.\nHigh on the elixir of risk, I didn\u2019t care.\nIn my head I was Michael Schumacher\nand he never lost... just like Dad.\nCome back next week for the\nconclusion of Raw Words.

    "content": "22 FRIDAY 22 NOV\nFILM Editor: John Park\nChiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave)\nDirector Steve McQueen certainly\nhit the critical jackpot with his brutal,\nunflinching slavery drama, and at the\nheart of such ordeal is Chiwetel Ejiofor who is utterly compelling in the\nlead role. A free black man kidnapped\nand forced into slavery, Solomon\nNorthup (Ejiofor) spends hellish years\nworking away whilst witnessing and\nexperiencing unthinkable, unjustifiable cruelty. This will be a first-time\nnomination for the usually under-the-radar Ejiofor, who, no doubt, will be a\nbetter known name in the industry by\nthe end of the year.\nTom Hanks (Captain Phillips)\nOne of this year\u2019s expert nail-biting\nthrillers is headed by Tom Hanks,\nwhose mission is to protect his ship\nand crew from Somali pirates who\nboard with machine guns. His intel-ligence, courage and calm sense of\nreasoning keep him alive throughout,\nalthough it\u2019s the final scenes that serve\nas an impressive showcase for Hanks\u2019\nabilities. The film itself has attracted\nsome controversy surrounding the accuracy of events, but this in no way\nshould hurt Hanks\u2019 chance of scoring\na nomination, who is possibly looking\nat a double nomination this year.\nRobert Redford (All is Lost)\nLeading J. C. Chandor\u2019s one-man survival drama at sea is none other than\nscreen veteran Robert Redford, who\ngives what must be one of the tough-est, most physically challenging roles\nof his career. Redford is the only credited member of the cast, and he alone\nis responsible for keeping the audience\ncaptivated throughout the whole film,\nwhich he successfully does. That he is\n77 years old makes this man vs nature\nfilm that much more tense and exciting to watch, and as Redford reaches\nfor the very last ounce of the human\nsurvival spirit, it\u2019s one thrilling ride.\nForest Whitaker (The Butler)\nIt may have been a while since the\nrelease of Lee Daniels\u2019 massive Oscar-bait of a film, but momentum is\ncertainly strong enough for Forest\nWhitaker to be able to gain a well-deserved recognition for his deeply\ntouching turn. In portraying a White\nHouse butler who served for over\nthree decades, Whitaker is mostly\nvery quiet, but most certainly powerful even in his long-sustained silence.\nIt\u2019s the best thing Whitaker has done\nsince his Oscar-winning turn in The\nLast King of Scotland, and maybe a\nsecond win won\u2019t be so far off.\nDecember is just around the corner,\nand film studios are lining up their\ncritically-lauded films to take part in\nthis year\u2019s much-anticipated Oscar\nrace. As with any year, there are strong\ncontenders in every field and it\u2019s\ncertainly too early to be betting on a\nwinner.\nSo over the next few weeks, Felix\nFilm will be giving you a breakdown of\nthe actors, actresses and films that will\nbe grabbing the headlines in the near\nfuture; but this is in no way a definitive\nlist, as some of the films haven\u2019t even\nbeen released here yet.\nThis week in our feature is the Best\nLead Actor category.\nReady...\nSteady...\nGo!\n2014 at the Oscars:\n\n"

It\ndoesn\u2019t get much more\nmetal that a show headlined by modern day Vikings Amon Amarth with\nheroes of the grindcore and melodic\ndeath genres Carcass, the fresher\nfaced Bleed From Within and cult\n80\u2019s heavy metal band Hell opening\nproceedings. All to a sold out Kentish\nTown Forum filled with excited fans.\nHell\u2019s impressive stage set-up and\nbackdrop is more than you would normally expect from the first band of four\nbut doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to those\nfamiliar with the group. Frontman\nDavid Bower delivers a theatrical performance during which he performs\nexorcisms on lucky crowd members in\nthe front row and performs self-flagel-lation, all whilst sporting some pretty\nMetal Hammer: Defenders of the Faith\nI\nAMS album of the week\nA world away from the pop punk\nsound of A Fever You Can\u2019t Sweat Out,\nPanic! at the Disco\u2019s new album, Too\nWeird To Live, Too Rare To Die!, lands\nus smack bang in the middle of the\ncontemporary electro and dance scene.\nI\u2019m neither surprised nor upset by this\nmove; Panic! has always pushed the\nboundaries and demonstrated versatility\n(fingers to the second album, Beatles nay\nsayers). However, previously the vocals\nwere balanced with an eclectic use of\ninstruments and quirky sounds. Now we have a less than imaginative use of the\nvocoder and this album is synth\u2019d up to its eyeballs.\nUltimately, the success of this album is down to Brendon\u2019s voice. The album\nbegins with \u2018This is Gospel,\u2019 where he smashes us in the face with the chorus (the\nvocals ring true through the vocoder which is just there as a genre play thing).\nIn round 3, \u2018Vegas Lights\u2019 with its distinct 80s and glitzy Vegas influence (a little\non the nose given the name, but hey!) further sets the scene for Brendon\u2019s vocal\nonslaught. In rounds 4, 5, & 6, - \u2018Girl That You Love\u2019, \u2018Nicotine\u2019 & \u2018Girls/Girls/\nBoys\u2019, we are fully against the ropes, bludgeoned and in awe by these tracks that\nare surely destined to be club anthems. In the closing round, we are put to sleep\nby \u2018The End Of All Things\u2019, a lyrical and poetic reminder of the softer (despite\nthe harsh electronic tones) side of Panic! A phenomenal display by Brendon but\nnot as impressive a Panic! collection as I might have hoped for.\nOn to the music videos. \u2018Miss Jackson\u2019. Cult\u2026 what\u2026 huh? Anyway, the video\nfor Girls/Girls/Boys is definitely worth a comment and a watch. Brendon, who\nconceded this summer that he, alongside everyone, is a little bit gay, took it\nupon himself to cast homage to D\u2019Angelo\u2019s \u2018Untitled [How Does It Feel]\u2019. Now,\nD\u2019Angelo\u2019s caramel creation is steamy and dripping in eroticism. Brendon,\nhowever, do you even lift? Bless him, for he should have done at least one pushup prior to making this music video. The one redeeming feature of the video\noccurs at the final chorus when Brendon flicks his hair at the camera, charged\nwith all the emotion that wailing about girls loving both sexes naturally would\nresult in, and that makes this writer favour the album and closer to agreeing\nwith Brendon\u2019s summer sentiment.\nPanic! At the Disco \u2013 Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!\nGeorge Spence-Jones\nwicked looking red contacts. The classic NWOBHM sounds that accompany this spectacle more than match up\nto it. Having initially formed in 1982,\na series of unfortunate events meant\nthat Hell were only able to release their\ndebut album upon reforming in 2008,\nhaving survived in the underground\ntape trading scene for the intervening\nperiod.Itisagreatdisappointmentthat\nwe are only treated to five songs and\nare denied the devil horns and stilts\nseen at bloodstock earlier this year.\nBleed From Within from Glasgow\nare up next; they are making a habit of\ngetting onto some fairly major billings\nhaving supported Megadeth earlier\nthis year. Given the animosity felt by\nsome members of the metal community towards bands of the metalcore ilk,\nBleed From Within might be forgiven\nfor approaching a show featuring Carcass with some trepidation. As it turns\nout, there is no sign that the group\u2019s\nconfidence has been affected at all. A\nsmall group of fans manage to open up\na pretty sizable, if sparsely populated\npit, in the centre of the room. I also\nsaw vocalist Scott Kennedy attempt\nto catch his own spit at one point,\nwhich is pretty strange behaviour,\nbut whatever works for you I guess.\nCarcass come to the show having\nreleased Surgical Steel in September,\nthe legendary group\u2019s first album since\n1996. Carcass played a pioneering\nrole in the grindcore genre with their\nearly works, being among the first to\nrecord anything so musically extreme\nat the time. They hold an influential\nposition within melodic death metal\nas well due to the album Heartwork,\nreleased in 1993, which helped establish the genre alongside bands from\nthe Swedish death metal scene. The\ngory themes and imagery that they\nput forward, a deliberate statement\ngiven their own strongly held vegan\nviews, as well track titles full of medical terminology and sound clips about\nautopsies have been highly influential.\nNot to mention the effect of the extreme vocals or furious technicality\nof their guitar and drum sounds. They\nare clearly the main draw for many at\nthe show given the initial response to\ntheir \u2018Surgical Steel\u2019 banner. Frustratingly the Forum\u2019s muddy acoustics\nmean that Jeff Walker\u2019s gnarled vocals\nare often lost behind the music but\nthis cannot fully hold back classics like\n\u2018The Mortal Coil\u2019 or \u2018Corporal Jigsore\nQuandary\u2019 which go down a storm re-gardless. Carcass are more than able\nto live up to their legendary status.\nBad news first, the forum\u2019s stage is\ntoo small so Amon Amarth were not\nable to bring their Viking longboat with\nthem for this show. If you are unfamiliar with the Viking themed melodic\ndeath metal group, that first sentence\nshould tell you everything you need to\nknow. They have a long ship! Is there\nanyone that doesn\u2019t think that is awe-some? Even without their centrepiece,\nfrontman Johan Hegg can still sport a\ncomically oversized hammer for the\nshow, as well as the standard huge\nbackdrop pictures of Surtur, Odin and\nmany Vikings. Some snazzy looking\ntombstones make an appearance during \u2018Runes To My Memory\u2019 complete\nwith glowing runes. From the moment\n\u2018Father Of The Wolf\u2019 starts, pandemonium descends, with a huge backlog\nof unstoppable anthems and an unlimited supply of epic, ridiculous bra-vado, Amon Amarth deliver pure fun\nfor the whole of their set. Urging the\ncrowd on and chugging from drinking\nhorns, they give the impression that\nthey too are having a great time. Having opened with newer material from\nthe recently released Deceiver Of The\nGods album, which proves the band\nis still going strong, more established\ntracks like \u2018Guardians Of Asgaard\u2019\nand \u2018Destroyer Of The Universe\u2019 provide great opportunities to sing along.\nAs is pointed out, it doesn\u2019t even really matter if you know the words, it\u2019s\ndeath metal, nobody can understand\nyou anyway. Although I doubt anyone\nhas that problem with tunes as catchy\nas these. Twin guitar harmonies usually reserved for power metal acts\nare combined with the bite of death\nmetal and Hegg\u2019s signature deep\ngrowls to produce an instantly identifiable sound. There was never going\nto be enough time for this many great\nbands and sure enough when 11pm\narrives it seems like everyone is left\nwishing for more. Fortunately Amon\nAmarth have been announced for\nthis summer\u2019s bloodstock festival so\nthey may just have their wish granted.\nThomas Heaven\n\n"

Goodbye.\u201d\nKunal Wagle\nSports Editor\nO\nn Thursday 16th\nNovember 1989, a\nsixteen-year-old took\nguard in his first\ninnings for India and\nfaced one of the most feared bowling\nattacks in the world. He was dismissed\nby fellow debutant Waqar Younis for\n15, but everyone knew that there\nwas something special about this\nschoolboy \u2013 the youngest ever test\ncricketer at the time.\n24 years later to the day, this \u2018little genius\u2019 gave a 25 minute farewell speech\nto the crowd at his home ground in\nMumbai, talking about how \u201cit is hard\nto believe that this wonderful journey\nhas come to an end\u201d. In light of crick-eting legend Sachin Tendulkar\u2019s retirement Felix takes a look at his ten\nbest innings in an India shirt.\n10. 114 v Australia\nPerth 1992\nTendulkar, on his first tour of Australia, was fast running out of partners as India slumped to 159-8 in\nPerth (known as one of the bounciest\npitches in the world). The Australian\nbowling attack was looking forward to\nexposing a major weakness in Sachin\nTendulkar\u2019s game by bouncing him\nout. But he responded in a way nobody could have imagined. His innings of 114 from 161 balls gave India\na fighting chance (which they ultimately wasted), and gave the world a\nclue of what might be to come.\n9. 155 v Australia\nChennai 1998\nThis innings was one of the famous\nbattles that took place between Tendulkar and Shane Warne over the\nyears. When Tendulkar arrived at the\ncrease, India were 47 runs behind and\ntwo wickets down. Shane Warne was\nin his element, bowling on a fourth\nday Indian pitch with a lot of rough\non the leg side. Under pressure, Tendulkar launched into one of the best\ncounter-attacking innings anyone has\never played, frequently slog-sweeping\nWarne into the stands. When India\ndeclared later in the day, Tendulkar\nwas not out on 155 and had helped\nIndia to a match winning lead of 347.\n8. 146 v South Africa\nCape Town 2011\nTendulkar had already scored one\ncentury in the series \u2013 his fiftieth \u2013\nbut this was by far and away the more\nimportant one. India were level at 1-1\nand aiming for an improbable series\ndraw on the green and bouncy pitches\nof South Africa. India were 28-2 in\nresponse to South Africa\u2019s 362 and\nwere in trouble \u2013 especially considering the low scores that both sides\nhad presented in the series thus far.\nAgainst an impressive Dale Steyn and\nMorne Morkel, Tendulkar racked up\n146. Tendulkar then scored a patient\n14 from 91 balls on day five to save\nthe test, the series and India\u2019s status as\nnumber one in the world. This would\nturn out to be Tendulkar\u2019s last test\ncentury.\n7. 119 v England\nOld Trafford 1991\nChasing a near impossible 408 to win\nthe game, India slumped to 127-5, and\neven saving the game looked unlikely.\nA seventeen-year-old Tendulkar then\nshocked everyone as he produced a\nperformance with great character,\nscoring his first test century and saving the game for India \u2013 against all\nodds.\n6. 143 v Australia\nSharjah 1998\nAustralia\u2019s target for India of 284 was\nlargely irrelevant in this game. The\nmore important figure was that of\n250 (adjusted after a sandstorm mid-game), which is what India needed to\nbook a place in the final on net run\nrate (Australia had already qualified).\nOn a tough pitch \u2013 and Shane Warne\nbowling \u2013 Tendulkar produced a master class, scoring at more than a run a\nball to lead India to the final.\n5. 241 v Australia\nSydney 2004\nThis innings could almost be thought\nof as the resurrection of Tendulkar\u2019s\ncareer (although that might be a bit\nover the top). Tendulkar had endured\na miserable 2003, scoring only 150\nruns all season. The rumblings had\nstarted \u2013 maybe Tendulkar was past\nhis prime? Tendulkar proved them\nwrong in the New Year\u2019s test in 2004,\nscoring 241 not out as India racked\nup 705. His next two innings were 61\nnot out in the second innings, and 194\nnot out in the first test against Pakistan. He wasn\u2019t dismissed in 2004 until\nApril 5th. Tendulkar was back to his\nscintillating best.\n4. 98 v Pakistan\nCenturion 2003\nIt may seem strange that one of Tendulkar\u2019s best innings isn\u2019t a century\n\u2013 especially given he has 100 of them\n\u2013 but the reality is that even Tendulkar\nthinks this was his best innings, peri-od. There was a lot of hype surround-INSIDE\nHow to win in Germany? Get a hangover!\nterrorist attacks had just taken place\nin Mumbai, and this match had\nhad to be hastily rearranged and\nmoved to Chennai from Mumbai.\nTendulkar, a Mumbai man, had appeared in many advertisements in\nthe lead up to the match telling the\nIndian people to stick together. On\nthe pitch, India had been behind the\n8-ball for the first four days of the\nmatch. But as usual Tendulkar came\nto the rescue. Chasing 387 to win\n(the third highest chase ever at the\ntime), Tendulkar reached his hundred while hitting the winning runs.\nThe commentator\u2019s words, \u201cMake no\nmistake about it, this is for Mumbai\u201d\ncould not have been more apt.\n1. 134 v Australia\nSharjah 1998\nIf his previous innings in Sharjah\nwas great (see 6), then this performance that Tendulkar produced two\ndays later in the final could only be\nclassed as sensational. By this time\nTendulkar was clearly causing Shane\nWarne nightmares (he also scored\na century against them in the ICC\nChampions Trophy later in the year,\nalong with the ones in 9 and 6), as\nhe again swatted him away. Chasing\na target of 273 to win, Tendulkar led\nIndia to victory scoring 134 from\n131 balls.\ning the last group stage match \u2013 India\nand Pakistan had not played each other in more than three years. Chasing\n274, Tendulkar famously destroyed\nShoaib Akhtar in his first over, and\nwent on to score 98 in 75 balls, despite\nsuffering from cramp. Fireworks went\noff in India after the match \u2013 not because India had qualified for the next\nround, not because of the result, but\nbecause Tendulkar had single-hand-edly knocked arch-rivals Pakistan out\nof the World Cup in the first round.\n3. 200 v South Africa\nGwalior 2010\nIt was only fitting that the first person\nto score 200 in One-Day-Internationals was the leading run scorer in the\nform of the game. Already leading\n1-0 in a three match series, Tendulkar\nbatted serenely through the entire 50\novers, scoring his 200th run in the last\nover. India went on to take the series\n2-1. To put it into context, Tendulkar\nonly batted one other time in the se-ries, scoring 4. He was still named\nman of the series.\n2. 103 v England\nChennai 2008\nWhen people remember this innings\nthey\u2019ll also remember the circumstances that surrounded it.

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 22 NOV\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Fang-tom Menace\nLatest adaptation of Dracula has yet to impress\nIt was easy to respond to the news of\nNBC and Sky\u2019s latest venture, Dracula,\nwith a roll of the eyes. What with the\nfrenzied spate of anything vampire-themed following the dubious success\nof Twilight, including the rise and fall\nof True Blood and The Vampire Diaries, it would appear that the show is\njumping on the bandwagon five years\ntoo late.\nOn the other hand, when looking for\nsource material for a tale about vam-pires, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find\nanything better than Bram Stoker\u2019s\noriginal novel which was, after all, responsible for igniting the whole vampire craze in the first place. The titular\ncharacter in the book, first published\nin 1879, is a far cry from Edward Cullen, with no sparkles or teenage angst\nin sight. In hindsight, it\u2019s more surprising that it took this long for a new\nadaption to be made.\nThe show takes more than a few liberties with the story, which isn\u2019t in itself a problem: over the years, the story has been adapted and reinterpreted\nso many times that it\u2019s difficult to do\nit in an original way. Yet there\u2019s a lot\nto puzzle over from just the first epi-sode. The pilot starts off with two archaeologists investing a crypt, where\nthey discover the ominously caged remains of a skeleton in a sarcophagus.\nIn a twist that is shocking to approximately no one, one of the tomb raiders turns out to be somewhat shady\nand slices his partner\u2019s throat over the\nskeletal figure, thereby rejuvenating\nthe corpse. So far, pretty standard for\na vampire flick.\nWe\u2019re then transported to London\nand introduced to Alexander Grayson,\naka Dracula, posing as an American\nbusinessman for reasons I couldn\u2019t\nquite figure out (this would be less of\nan issue except actor Jonathan RhysMeyers puts on a pretty atrocious\nAmerican accent). He\u2019s throwing a\ngrand party in an attempt to impress\nthe British socialites, which he does\nby unveiling his new invention: a machine that generates wireless power\ndrawn from\u2026 the Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield, apparently? This is about all the\nexplanation we receive, apart from\nDracula boasting how Edison and\nTesla couldn\u2019t manage it, and a lot\nof steam-powered machinery in the\nbasement.\nSuitably impressed with Dracula\u2019s\nnew technology is Mina Murray, a\nyoung medical student studying under Van Helsing, who\u2019s being escorted by her beau, journalist Jonathan\nHarker. She is immediately drawn to\nDracula, who likewise takes an interest in her after flashbacks reveal she\nlooks identical to his long-dead wife.\nThe show makes some pretty big\ndepartures from both the novel and\nprevious adaptations, not least of\nwhich is the role of Van Helsing \u2013 traditionally Dracula\u2019s nemesis \u2013 who is\nrevealed to be the person responsible\nfor reviving Dracula in the first place.\nAlso introduced are a few new char-acters, such as Lady Jayne Wetherby, a\nrich socialite who gets pretty intimate\nwith Dracula in a viewing box at the\nopera, but who\u2019s also handy with a\npair of knives.\nDracula has all the ingredients of a\ndecent vampire show, but so far seems\nto be lacking in something. Dracula\nhimself doesn\u2019t feel menacing enough,\nwith too much emphasis on his charm\nand good looks (admittedly handsome though Jonathan Rhys-Meyers\nis); it gives the impression that the\nvampire is being portrayed as an anti-hero, rather than the straight-up monster he\u2019s supposed to be. NBC and Sky\nLiving, the channels jointly responsible for producing the show, were also\nboth home to the fantastic Hannibal\nwhich premiered earlier in the year,\nand perhaps would have done well to\ntake from there a few tips as to how\nto reimagine a famous fictitious vil-lain. Whilst ratings are dropping off\nin America, Dracula seems to have\ngotten off to a stronger start here in\nthe UK, and with a first series of ten\nepisodes, there\u2019s plenty of time for the\nshow to pick up. Let\u2019s hope Dracula\nfinds his bite in the near future.\nEmily Fulham Television Editor\nWhat\u2019s on this week\nDoctor Who: The Day of the\nDoctor\nThe long-awaited 50th anniversary\nepisode promises to bring back\nmuch-loved characters from the\npast, including the tenth Doctor\nand Rose Tyler. For fans who just\ncan\u2019t wait to get their fix of the\nTimelord, two mini-episodes, The\nNight of the Doctor and The Last\nDay, are available on the BBC website and iTunes.\nSunday 24th November,\nBBC One, 7.40pm\nNew this week On catch-up\nLegacy\nSet at the height of the Cold War,\nthis one-off special from the BBC\nfollows Charles Thoroughgood, a\nyoung spy thrown head-first into\nhis first mission: turning an old\nSoviet university acquaintance over\nto the British side.

All day Mondays\nand Tuesdays until\nDecember 3, students can skate for\n\u00a38.50 with a free drink at the Caf\u00e9\nBar. If you present your student ID\nwhen booking tickets at the box\noffice and then save your ticket, you\ncan show it at the Caf\u00e9 Bar for a\ndrink of your choice.\nI went to check out the offer on\nTuesday evening with some friends.\nI\u2019ve been skating at the NHM during\nprevious years but I never fail to\nenjoy the ambience of skating there.\nIn my opinion this atmosphere\nimproves during the evening \u2013 the\ntwinkling lights in the trees around\nthe rink add something especially\nwintry to the event.\nThe Natural History Museum\u2019s\nskates are the most uncomfortable\nI\u2019ve ever worn. They are the bane\nof any skating session I participate\nin there. Otherwise the skating is a\nlot of fun! Your session starts on the\nhour and lasts for 50 minutes so it\u2019s\nworth getting there 15 minutes early\nto make sure you take maximum\nadvantage of the cheaper ticket. As\na warning, putting your bag in the\ncloakroom costs \u00a32 so you might\nwant to take a big bag that you can\nput everyone\u2019s stuff in, or just not\nbring a bag with you at all!\nOnce you\u2019re out on the ice you are\ngreeted with a great Christmas tree\nin the centre of the rink, forming a\ncircuit. It can be very busy during\ncertain sessions (the disadvantage\nwith going in the evening) but\nalmost all skaters regardless of\nability seem to enjoy themselves. It\u2019s\nvery informal and there are as many\npeople skating around by themselves\nas there are those hand-in-hand\nchatting away. I think only incredible\nskaters wouldn\u2019t have as enjoyable a\ntime.\nAfter the session you head back\ninside, hand in your skates and look\nforward to your free drink! (I guess\nyou could get your drink beforehand\nbut I\u2019m not sure skating on a glass of\nwine is the best idea.) There\u2019s also a\nsmall on-site Mountain Warehouse\nshop and if the NHM\u2019s official skating\nphotographer snapped a photograph\nof you and your mates you can buy\nyour photos here (prices for photos\nstart at \u00a38).\nIf you\u2019re looking to definitely get\nyour free drink without any hassle or\nstress involved, I advise avoiding the\n8pm session that I attended. Even if\nyou have a full day pick the 6pm or\n7pm session. I was told that drinks\nvouchers could be redeemed up\nuntil half past 9, but when I arrived\nthere was a sign on the box office\nsaying your free drink could only\nbe claimed until 9pm. They are very\nparticular about this and will stop\nserving very abruptly as soon as the\nclock strikes 9, regardless of the state\nof your order.\nI got my free drink by leaving the\nice a little early. The drinks available\nare beer, house white or red wine,\nand cold drinks or hot drinks that\ninclude hot chocolate and various\ncoffees and teas. You might want to\npick up a menu so you don\u2019t have\nto make an ad-hoc decision about\nwhat to drink. The Caf\u00e9 Bar has\na real skiing resort feel to it, with\nlong benches and large vintage\ntrunks serving as tables in some\nspots. There\u2019s also an area with sofas\naround a big (obviously false) open\nfire. The food is pretty pricey so I\nwouldn\u2019t bother grabbing a snack!\nThe student offer is only on until\nDecember 3, so if it takes your\nfancy, don\u2019t delay and go next\nweek!\nI\nt\u2019s less than two weeks until\nthe RCSU Science Challenge\n2014 launch event, on Tuesday\nDecember 3rd. Come along to\nfind out what prizes will be on\noffer and to hear the judges speak about\nscience communication and reveal their\nquestions for this year\u2019s Challenge. You\ncan book your free place now online\nat http://bit.ly/1ekv9Vj. And there\nwill of course be free food and drink\nafterwards! You really have no reason\nnot to attend.\nThe Science Challenge is our flagship\nevent of 2014 and has included\nnumerous distinguished judges. We\nhave now announced all of our judges\nfor this year. Professor Fay Dowker is\na Professor of Theoretical Physics here\nat Imperial. Jon Kudlick is the director\nof communications with the Society\nof Biology. Pallab Ghosh is a science\ncorrespondent with the BBC.

Rape. Murder. Witches.\nVoodoo. Resurrection. Zombies.\nSlavery. Blood. Goats. Snakes. Limbs.\nA severed tongue. Yes, Ryan Murphy is\nback doing what he does best \u2013 laying\non the dark and twisted in the new\nseason of his hit anthology, American\nHorror Story, this year appropriately\ntitled Coven. Every season is a\nstandalone one, each with its very own\nbeginning, middle and an end, which\nstops the show from growing stale, as\nfresh new ideas come alive every year.\nAs can be sussed out from the title,\nwe focus on a group of modern day\nwitches who face extinction.\nZoe Benson (Taissa Farmiga)\ndiscovers her unique witchy \u2018gift\u2019\nof literally being able to use sex as a\ndeadly weapon, when the first boy\nshe does the deed with dies of a\nmysterious brain haemorrhage. For\nher own protection and education,\nshe is sent away to a special boarding\nschool run by Cordelia Foxx (Sarah\nPaulson), who is focused on teaching\nher students Madison Montgomery\n(Emma Roberts), Queenie (Gabourey\nSidibe), Nan (Jamie Brewer) and Zoe\nwhilst also keeping them safe from\ndangers of the outside world.\nThe unexpected return of Fiona\nGoode (Jessica Lange) signals trouble\nfor everyone involved. As the reigning\nSupreme of the generation, she is\nthe most powerful witch in town,\nalthough age seems to be taking its\ntoll on the once-omnipotent glamour-cat, and her obsession with keeping\nher youthful looks and powers intact\nis her main objective. Cordelia isn\u2019t\nthrilled to have her unstable mother\naround the house, and her tendency\nto seek out trouble and violence\nwherever she goes. Also not pleased\nwith this new arrival is Marie Laveau\n(Angela Bassett), an immensely skilled\nvoodoo queen who\u2019s been alive since\nthe 1800s, it seems.\nNew addition Kathy Bates also has a\nprominent role, based on the real-life\nMadame Marie Delphine LaLaurie,\nwhose infamous treatment of her\ndomestic staff is portrayed on the\nscreen here, as she gains pleasure in\ntorturing her group of black servants.\nIt was promised Bates would play\na woman five times worse than her\nMisery character of Annie Wilkes, and\nBates\u2019 LaLaurie does not disappoint.\nHow she fits into the overall modern\nday timeline is through some spooky\nvoodoo trick which promises to have\na lot of fun in store for us.\nAmerican Horror Story is a show\nwhere restraint has no place in any of\nits episodes. The crazier it gets, the\nmore deliciously fun it is for the audi-ence. The uneasy truce between the\nwitches\u2019 coven and the voodoo practitioner builds to a boiling point early\non, and gloves will certainly be coming off as these two powerful forces go\nhead to head, reigniting a bloody war\nthat should light our screens ablaze\nwith fire, blood, guts and gore.\nThere is internal conflict within the\ncoven, as Fiona\u2019s reckless use of her\npowers alerts the Council, headed\nby Fiona\u2019s long-time nemesis, Myrtle\nSnow (American Horror Story regular\nFrances Conroy with crazy red hair).\nThis rivalry is also setting up to\nbecome a juicy plot strand, and with\ntwo actresses of exceptional acting\nabilities, their showdown should be\none to look forward to.\nMurphy\u2019s genius move of recycling\nvarious members of his cast is one\nof the most attractive features of his\nanthology series. Lange, as usual, is\na commanding force of nature who\nmakes the show what it is, Paulson\nis equally as strong, Denis O\u2019Hare is\nimmensely creepy as a loyal cross-dressing, doll-collecting, tea-party-loving house servant, and making a\nparticularly welcome return is Lily\nRabe as a slow-moving, slow-talking\nbut powerful witch who can resurrect\nanything. She, too, is not all right in\nthe head, which will most definitely\nlead to unpredictable developments.\nZoe\u2019s relationship with Kyle (Evan\nPeters) brings back the similar\nforbidden love subplot from Murder\nHouse that was missing in Asylum.\nEarly episodes have been so busy with\nsetting the tone with different witches\nthat Zoe and Kyle haven\u2019t yet had a\nwhole lot of time to spend together.\nThe same goes for the new neighbours\nof the witchy academy, the goodlooking Luke (Alexander Dreymon),\nhis bible-thumping mother Joan\n(Patti LuPone), as well as Cordelia\u2019s\nshady looking husband Hank (Josh\nHamilton). But so far seven episodes\nhave aired, and with six more to go,\neverything is looking so far so spooky.\nAmerican Horror Story does have\nthe tendency to start off incredibly\nstrong and die down slightly towards\nthe end (as is reflected by its television\nratings), but what it promises to\ndeliver in terms of shock value and\ncampy fun is done so week after week.\nIt\u2019s highly addictive, and for those who\ncan stomach the constant flashes of\nunthinkable violence, Coven is quite\na ride, and promises to be a whole lot\nmore horrifying in future episodes.\n\n"
