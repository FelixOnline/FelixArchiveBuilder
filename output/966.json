    "content": "Feature\nAn agreement too far\nJonty Beavan tries to drag sense out of Imperial College's own version\nof the Maastricht treaty\n1. The purpose of ICU The object or purpose of Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU), as set out in its\nBy-Laws approved by the Governing\nBody is:\na) the promotion of social intercourse\nbetween present and past students and\nacademic staff of the College.\nb) the encouragement of interest by\nstudents in matters outside the College\ncurriculum, especially cultural and\nathletic interests.\nc) the provision of a corporate body\nof students to represent and to safeguard\nand advance the interests and welfare of\nthe students of the College.\n2. The Status of ICU The College is a chartered corporation\ni.e. it has the powers of a person of full\nlegal capacity and is subject to common\nlaw and statute.\nICU is an unincorporated association\nand in law would be treated as part of\nthe College; because it cannot be sued,\nany action against it is likely to be\nbrought against the College and hence\nthe Governors who are the College.\nThe Governing Body has devolved the\nresponsibility for the organisation of\nmany of the non-academic activities of\nstudents in the College of ICU, which\nis required to operate within the rules\nand policies laid down in its By-Laws,\namendments to which have to be\napproved by the Governing Body.\n3. Financial Accountability\n3.1 ICU shall conduct its financial\nactivities in accordance with its Financial\nregulations and Procedures which have\nbeen approved by the Audit Committee\nof the Governing Body.\n3.2 The Union Senior Treasurer,\nelected by the ICU Finance Committee\nand approved by the Rector, will report\non any irregular procedures in the\nmanagement of public funds and those\nresulting from the Union's trading\nactivities, to that committee. He will also\nbe responsible for protecting the\nCollege's interests by reporting on\nICU's financial matters to the Director\nof Finance as the Union Senior\nTreasurer sees fit.\n3.3 Given the audit requirements\nimposed on the College by external\nbodies, the College Internal Audit\nService shall have access to ICU as it\nhas to any other part of the College.\n3.4 The College will allocate funds\nannually to ICU by means of a sub vent ion agreed by the context of the\nCollege's Annual Budget. This\nsub vent ion, the basis of which is to be\nclearly defined, will take account of\nICU's current trading activities which,\nit is acknowledged, provide a service to\nthe community, to be operated\nincreasingly efficiently and profitably.\nIt will also take account of ICU's responsibilities and their related costs.\nThe text adjacent is called a 'Memorandum of Understanding'. The\nGoverning Body of Imperial College has\nproposed this document to defuse any\nconfusion that exists in its relationship\nwith Imperial College Union (ICU).\nAt present this is a draft, it is open to\ndebate and discussion. The comments\nhere a meant as a guide and background\nto the jargon of the report. It is not an\nin depth explanation, and is not meant\nto be,\nThe final draft of this document will\ngo to the Governing Body of Imperial\nCollege to be ratified. At this point it\nbecomes a binding guide of how the\nCollege and Union deal with each other.\nAny disputes over this document must\nthen be overseen by the Governing Body.\nEssentially this means the Union can\nhave its cake and eat it. ICU is part of\nthe College, so is not legally liable for\nany of its actions. But, because College\ndo not want the responsibility of running\nstudent affairs, they allow the Union to\nlook after itself.\nThis rather relaxing state of power\nwithout responsibility is currently the\nsubject of a legal ruling. The results of\nthis ruling will be incorporated into this\nagreement when it is finally drafted. If\nthe legal position is as stated here, the\nUnion is unlikely to take advantage of\nthis rather generous relationship. If any\nabuse did occur, the response would be\nswift and draconian.\nAll this year Clubs and Societies at\nICU have been forced into sorting out\ntheir finances. The revised College\nfinancial regulations demand clear\naccountability and responsibility for all\nmonies. This could mean loses incurred\nby clubs coming out of the pockets of\nstudent treasurers.\nA Senior treasurer is a member of\nCollege staff who signs most cheque\nwritten for student based activity. This\nperson, currently Dr Peter Muller, is\nduty bound to report any irregularities\nto College\nIn part 3.1 any audit of college also\nincludes an audit of the Union. Thus the\nUnion must allow auditors access to all\nrecords.\nThe sub vent ion is a lump sum of money\nthat is given to the Union so it can\nfunction. Section 3.4 gives the condition\nthat if Union services, like Da Vinci's, make large amounts of money that\nsub vent ion can change. As a respite to\nthe incentive to self fund, the College\nallows a opt out clause: The motive\nbehind Union outlets should be to\nThose currently agreed, which are to be\ndetailed in an annexe to this\nMemorandum, are subject to review\nfrom time to time.\n3.5 ICU and the College will work\ntowards establishing a unified system of\nfunding and accounting for the three\nConstituent College Unions (CCUs) of\nICU on the South Kensington site,\nSilwood Park and the fourth C CU on the\nPaddington site at St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School (SMHMS).\n4. Trading Activities\nThe College and ICU are agreed on\nthe need to define the nature and extent\nof the trading activities carried out by\nICU, in order to clarify their relationship\nwith other trading activities in the\nCollege. The ability of ICU to act as\nagents for the College in relation to third\nparties will also be defined.\n5. Allocation and Management of\nStudent Areas\n5.1 The Governing Body will from\ntime to time review and determine those\nareas of the College which may be\nmanaged by ICU and used exclusively\nfor student functions, sporting and\ntrading activities.\n5.2 Those areas which are identified\nfor use primarily or solely as areas for\nstudent functions will be let by ICU to\nits clubs, societies and outside\norganisations on the understanding that\nthey abide by the College Functions and\nEvents Policy, procedures and code of\npractice.\n6. Compliance with Legislation.\n6.1 Health and Safety at Work\nAct/College H&S Policy\n6.1.1 ICU is responsible to the Rector\nfor complying with the College Health\nand Safety Policy, its Procedures and\nCodes of Practice.\n6.1.2 The President of ICU will be the\nperson responsible for health and safety\nmatters in ICU and will have the same\ndelegated responsibilities in this respect\nas those defined in the College Health\nand Safety Policy Document for a Head\nof Department.\n6.1.3 ICU will set up a Health and\nSafety Committee which will be chaired\nby the Union Manager. Its remit will\ninvolve advising the President on such\nmatters as affect the safety of students\nand others in the Union Building and at\nstudent functions and events elsewhere,\nand ensuring the safety of equipment\nowned by ICU and its clubs and societies\nwherever located. It may set up such\nHealth and Safety sub-committees as are\nnecessary to do this.\n6.1.5 The ICU Health and Safety\nCommittee at South Kensington will be\na sub-committee of the Sherfield Health\nand Safety Committee. Health & Safety\nmatters affecting students at SM HMS will remain the responsibility of the\nDean, SM HMS and his Area Health and\nbalance the service aspect and profit. In\nreal life, if the Union uses profit from\none area to support another then it's OK\nby the College.\nICU as an umbrella organisation for\nthe Constituent College Unions ( CCUs,\nmade up of: Royal College of Science,\nCity and Guilds, Mines and St Mary's) is almost certain to evolve.\nUnfortunately, this does not mean that\nMary's have to like it, much wrangling\nwith medics will result from section 3.5.\nBy Trading Activities the College\nmeans: The Print Unit, The Bookstore\nand the Bar. Here College want to define\nwhat services the Union can offer and\nwhich they will fulfil. There are obvious\nclashes, Southside Bar (college run)\ncompetes for student drinkers with Da\nVinci's in the Union, (although no one\nadmits it)\nThird parties mean arrangements like\nthat with the Student Travel Association\n(STA) on the walkway. The Union rents\nout space to STA and the College\nreceives a share of the profit. The\nrelationship with outside bodies, by the\nUnion, on behalf of the College has to\nbe defined, this section makes a note of\nthis fact.\nThe Union uses areas such as the JCR\nand Southside Gym, which it does not\ndirectly own. Use is controlled by a code\nof practice defined by the Governing\nBody of College. Again this is an area\nof debate, the priority of student\nbookings of rooms compared to more\nlucrative commercial use has yet to be\ndefined.\nThis area explains how the Union is\nnow responsible for student and Union\nStaff safety.\nAs the Students' Union generally\ngathers control for all its own affairs,\nits responsibility increases. A corresponding effect has been felt by\nclubs and societies over the past\nacademic year, as the Union takes more\nof an interest in their safety practices.\nThe rest of this section defines the way\nHealth and Safety legislation will be\nobserved. The document defines the\nPresident of the Students' Union is liable\nfor Health and safety, while the Union\nmanager actually carrys out the work.\nPage 10\n\n"

The\nnew remit for Welfare Chairman\nmay overlap slightly with the job\ndescription of Overseas Officer,\nwhich will itself overlap with the\nexisting post of Chairman of the\nOverseas Students' Committee\n(OSC). A clear distinction is being\nmade, with the Overseas Officer\nresponsible for all overseas\nstudents, irrespective of their\nmembership, if any, of Overseas\nStudents' Societies. The OSC\nchairman will continue to represent\nthe members of Overseas Societies.\nSenior sabbaticals regard the\nsurvival of the post of OSC\nChairman as an indication of a very\nactive role for Union Major Subcommittee chairmen 'for several\nyears'. It has been suggested,\nthough, that some responsibilities\nheld by officers like the OSC\nChairman could devolve to the\nDeputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties). \"This is a rational is ation that might occur in future,' Felix\nwas told.\nThe new Entertainments Officer\nwill act as a co-or d in at or between\nthe Chairman of the Social, Cultural\nand Amusement Board, and the\nChairman of the Events Committee.\nThe new Entertainments Officer\npost is not expected to replace either\nof the existing jobs, but it has been\nsuggested that the two officers could\nshare the post of Entertainments\nOfficer.\nThe Communications Officer has\nbeen branded by some Council\nmembers as 'a press officer', ' Mr Davidson's Press Secretary', and\n'Imperial's Bernard Ingham.' The\njob description to be published next\nWednesday is expected to charge\nthe Communications Officer with\n'finding out what the membership\nwants' and liaising with the media.\n'It will be a50/50 split,' Felix has\nbeen told. We understand that this\nliaison will not extend to external\nmedia; the President will retain\nresponsibility for external affairs,\nbut may refer enquiries to the\nCommunications Officer.\nThe Communications Officer\nmay also be charged with\norganising welfare campaigns, such\nas the 'previously successful' Aids\nAwareness Week. As well as\nagreeing to the establishment of this\npost, last week's Council also\naccepted that clubs and societies\nSherfield open house\nwill have to absorb a cut in their\nbudgets to pay for an increase in the\ncommunications budget. 'Good,\neffective communications cost\nmoney,' Council was told by Chris\nDavidson, ICU President.\nMr Davidson will publish his next\nset of proposals on Wednesday, and\nbring them to the next meeting of\nCouncil the following week. The\nPresident told Felix that only 'a broad outline' had been produced\nso far, and that the next document\nwould be 'more fleshy'. He added\nhis thanks to those who had worked\non the Working Party on Structure,\nand also to Jim Glennon, his special\nadvisor.\nAs part of the overall Union\nreview, the Union media,\ncomprising Felix, IC Radio and\nSTOIC, are currently studying two\nproposals to alter their funding and\neditorial freedom. The Union is\nsuggesting that ICU will only fund\nthe media if they are accountable to\na Union General Meeting, and to\nbroad Union policy. This has been\ndescribed by Union figures as 'not\ndraconian control, but\nresponsibility'. The media is\nstudying a second proposals where\nthey receive no further funding\nfrom the Union, but instead are\ndirectly funded from College.\nEither proposal would involve the\nestablishment of a College- based\n'Press Complaints Commission'\n(PCC) which would check negative\nreporting, and which would enforce\nsanctions for breach of College\nDisciplinary codes. College\nManagement are believed to want\nthe existing Executive Committee\nof the Governing Body to act as the\nPCC.\nRelations between the College\nand the Union are also being\nredefined as part of separate\nreviews. A draft 'Heads of\nAgreement' document has been\nprinted, and was submitted to\nCouncil last Monday. The full text\nof the document is printed inside\nthis week's Felix, on pages 10-11.\nA guide to the text, written by Jonty\nBeavan (22), Felix Editor, is printed\nalongside.\nA final version of the Heads of\nAgreement will be presented to the\nlast Governing Body meeting of this\nyear in July. This meeting will also\ndiscuss further moves to establish\nthe independence of Imperial\nCollege within the University of\nLondon. The University of London\nwill hold a Senate meeting on 7\nJune. There is speculation that one\nof the parties may put a final\nultimatum on the table during this\nmeeting.\nby Declan Curry\nThe Sherfield Senior Common\nRoom (SCR) will be thrown open\nto students from this weekend.\nAngus Fraser, College Managing\nDirector, says that the move is 'in\nresponse to requests from students.'\nThe SCR is normally the preserve\nof academic staff, providing a place\nfor relaxation, intellectual\ndiscussion and gossip. It is also used\nfor the annual Pimlico\nConnectidn/HUB 'Christmas\nCaper', and for small meetings and\nother functions. Mr Fraser says that\nthe SCR will provide 'a quiet area\nfor study at weekends.'\nThe SCR will be open from 10am until 9.30pm on Saturday, and from\n9am to 9.30pm on Sunday, until the\nweekend of 19/20 June. The late\nSaturday opening is due to cleaning\nfollowing functions on Friday\nevenings. A previously-booked\nexternal function on Saturday 12\nJune means that the SCR will be\nclosed to students on that day. The\nopening time on the following\nSunday, 13 June, will be put back\nuntil 10am because of this.\nThe Lyon Playfair-HaldaneScience Museum library complex\nwill remain open at normal times on\nSaturday throughout this period. Mr\nFraser notes that the opening of the\nSCR at weekends will 'obviate the\nneed and expense of the library or\ndepartments opening on Sunday.'\nA coffee vending machine is\navailable in the SCR, unlike the\nfully stocked but locked bar. A chocolate machine is also on the\nSherfield foyer. Anyone wishing to\nuse the SCR must bring their\nsecurity swipe card. Managed success for IC\nby Felix reporters\nThe Imperial College community is\nanxiously waiting this morning for\nthe overall results of the latest Times\nGood University Guide.\nAdministrators, academics and\nstudents are hoping to maintain or\nbetter last October's national third\nplace ranking.\nPreliminary results published in\nthe Times this week show Imperial\npulling slightly ahead of similar.\nrankings last year. The\nManagement School entered the top\nten league for business and\nmanagement for the first time. At\nposition eight, it ties with last year's seventh placed City University.\nGreenwich and Kingston\nUniversities are both rated sixteenth\nfor management.\nImperial has maintained its joint\nfirst place ranking in the 'Sciences'\nleague table, a position shared with\nCambridge and Oxford.\nManchester, placed joint first in\n'Sciences' last October has been\nbeaten back to joint fourth place,\nshared with Birmingham, Bristol\nand Nottingham. University\nCollege London is joint eleventh,\nand King's College London joint\nseventeenth.\nFor the second consecutive time,\nOxford and Cambridge have both\nbeen pipped by Imperial College for\ntop national engineering college.\nOxford, at second, has climbed one\nplace since last year. The only other\nLondon college in the 'Top 20\nEngineering' is University College,\nat joint eighth with six other\ncolleges.\nImperial is also ranked third best\nresourced university, behind\nCambridge and the private\nBuckingham. Oxford struggles to a fourth. Despite a strong first placing\nfor London in the medicine league\ntable, Imperial medicine at St\nMary's Hospital Medical School in\nPaddington does not feature in the\nTop 20 national league.

Often when\nit is, it is as a peep show glimpse into\na twilight world; grim, grey dramas\nfull of the pain of the underclass.\nHowever Alan Gilbey's new play\nchallenges the normal dramatic\nperceptions of homelessness and\ndelivers a wry, witty perspective of\nlife on the street. It manages to\nconvey the problems of\nhomelessness more bleakly than a whole pamphlet of statistics and at\nthe same time it is good fun.\nThe play is a musical and all the\nsongs are those of Madness. You\nmay cringe, envisaging some stilted\ncontorted plot bent to fit around the\nlyrics of the Nutty Boys. But the\nwhole play manages to stay within\nthe bounds of realism and many of\nthe audience were of the opinion\nthat Madness had written some of\nthe songs specifically for the play.\nHowever those Madness\nconnoisseurs amongst you will\nknow that their lyrics mainly deal\nwith social problems, and those of\nyou who did not will be astounded\nby the bizarre maturity of their\nwork (perhaps).\nThe characters are all homeless\nand portray a range of 'types' of\nhomeless people (this may be\nconstrued as clich ed but since the\ncharacters are given depth it works\nwell), there is an alcoholic beggar,\nan old woman placed in the care of\nthe community (!), a young gay\nman whose family chucked him out,\na girl who is trying to rebuild her\nlife (after a history of sex-abuse and\ndrug addiction) by selling the Big\nThe Pigeon Jonathan Noel, a tired security\nguard escapes from his tortured\nhome to a second rate Parisian\nhotel, where he, together with his\naltered ego, relive his dark\nencounter with 'a rat with wings'\nthe Pigeon which has shattered his\nlife.

The result is a gradual\ndecline into anarchy as the new\nsociety the homeless have\nestablished for themselves\ndegenerates. At this point the\naudience has a collective feeling of\nguilt about the problem of\nhomelessness and to hammer this\nhome the play ends with a chilling\nream of statistics, I don't need to\nrepeat them here you all know that\nthey are bad.\nAt the end of the play I was left\nfeeling that as members of society\nit is our duty to accommodate the\nhomeless, and this means not just\nprotesting about better housing\nprovision, or giving people money\nin the street, or buying the Big\nIssue, it means treating the\nhomeless like people and listening\nto what they have to say in order\nto rekindle their faith in society.\nOn a lighter note I enjoyed the\nplay especially Jon Dawes rendition\nof 'Night Boat to Cairo', the theatre\nis nice and (unlike many theatres)\nthe bar remains open after the\nperformance.\nJ.

Freedom of Speech\nICU will comply with the College\nCode of Practice, drawn up under\nSection 43 of the Education (No. 2) Act\n1986 and approved by Governors in\n1987, and subsequent amendments,\nwhen organising events, to ensure that\nfreedom of speech within the law is\nsecured for its members, College staff\nand visiting speakers.\n8.

If a friendly\nresolution cannot be achieved, the\nExecutive Committee will investigate\nfurther and adjudicate and the Editor will\nabide by any decision reached.

Harlington Gravel Proceeds\nAs agreed by the Finance and\nExecutive Committees of the Governing\nBody at their meeting on 12 May 1989,\nthe policy in respect of proceeds arising\nfrom the extraction of gravel on the\nnorth side of the Harlington Sports\nGround shall be that the Governing Body\n'will administer all existing and future\nsporting and athletic facilities for the\nbenefit of students and that any income\narising from the use or disposal of such\nfacilities will be applied for the benefit\nof students. In pursuance of this\nundertaking, the responsibility for the\napplication of such income will be\nundertaken by a Trust composed of the\nChairman of the Athletics Committee,\na Past President of Imperial College\nUnion and the President of the Imperial\nCollege Union. 'The latter will be an\nobserver at relevant meetings of the\nInvestments Committee which has\nresponsibility for the investment of\nmonies derived from the sale of gravel\nfrom Harlington.

No media can object to a Complaints Commission, but why should\nit have jurisdiction over just Felix? This\nmeans STOIC and IC Radio can say\nwhat they please with out any redress.\nSecondly: If a complaints commission\ndid exists, it discuss cases about the\nexecutive of the Union. This executive\nis hardly going to give a fair ruling on\nreporting dealing with itself.\nThis explains the general principle\nbehind the management of the cash\nobtained from Harlington Gravel Fund.\nThe money was raised from gravel\nextracted from a sports field owned by\nImperial College Union. A trust fund\nwas set up from the proceeds and is used\nto support Sports activities by students\nat Imperial College.\n'Imperial College' Trademark\nThe College Crest and the 'Imperial\nCollege' tide are the property of the\nCollege and ICU shall have the non-exclusive right to reproduce them for\nsocial and commercial purposes,\nprovided that the style of use complies\nwith the conditions that are laid down\nby the College to protect its property and\ninterests, including those imposed upon\nit by the Royal College of Arms.\n11. Channels of Communication with\nthe College Administration\nWhilst there are informal channels of\ncommunication between the Sabbaticals\nand the Union Manager and members\nof the College Administration, it is\nagreed that these need to be kept under\nreview to ensure their effectiveness. In\naddition more formal reporting\nprocedures need to be maintained in\norder that the College can be assured that\nICU is carrying out its responsibilities\nin accordance with these Heads of\nAgreement. ICU will report on its\nfinancial matters, as required, to the\nCollege Audit Committee, its refectory\nservices matters to the college House\nCommittee, its health and safety matters\nthrough the Sherfield Health and Safety\nCouncil and its estates management\nmatters to the College Estates\nCommittee.\n12. Completion of the Memorandum\nof Understanding\nThe College and ICU will work\ntogether to reach an agreement on those\nadditional Heads of Agreement set out\nbelow, which are still incompletely\ndefined, by 31 July 1993, with a view\nto completing this Memorandum of\nUnderstanding for presentation to the\nGoverning Body on 17 December 1993.\n12.1 Allocation and Management of\nStudent Areas\nIt is agreed that the areas allocated to\nICU for use exclusively or partially for\nstudent activities, including its trading\nactivities, shall be defined and appended\nto this document.\n12.2 Identification of Annual Costs\nLiabilities\nIt is agreed that the annual costs for\nwhich ICU shall be liable, which will\nbe taken into account when agree ig the\nannual sub vent ion with the College,\nshall be identified and listed in an annexe\n\\o this document.\n12.3 Staff/Student Protocol\nIt is agreed that a protocol shall be\nestablished between the College and ICU\nto define the standards by which staff\nemployed by ICU and its student\nmembers shall conduct themselves in\nrelation to each other and this will be\nappended as an annexe to this\nMemorandum.\n12.4 ICU's Relationship with its\nCC U's It is agreed that the relationship\nbetween ICU and its CC Us should be\ndefined more clearly in order to improve\nthe control ICU has over its resources.\n12.5 Access to the College and its\nFacilities\nIt is agreed that the College and ICU shall define the basis upon which rights\nof access to the College and its facilities\nmay be granted to former students and\nstaff of the College.\nICU is allowed to use the Imperial\nCollege Crest for 'social and\ncommercial purposes', as long as this\ndoes not put the College into a bad light.\nThis area is a source of great debate.\nWhile communication between College\nand ICU is desirable, supplying the\nCollege with every thing they want to\nknow about ICU is not.\nIn particular, Finance. ICU is\nprepared to supply the with audited\naccounts, but not the detail. In contrast.\nCollege want to know exactly what is\ngoing on in the Union. The Union\nbelieves revealing detail of accounts\ncould create difficulties if the information\nbecame widely available. The College\nwant to know how much money the Bar\nis taking so they don't have to give the\nUnion as much next year. The Union\ndoes not agree. And so it goes on. This\none will run and run.\nThe rest of this document is bound\nover to Heads of Agreement. These are\npoints on which an understanding has\nbeen reached but the detail still needs\nto be discussed.\nAnnual Cost liabilities are Heating,\nGas and Electricity. ICU will now be\nresponsible for payment of these dues.\nNot as bad as it first seems, to pay, an\nincrease in the annual sub vent ion must\nfollow. If this money is given over to\nICU, who can try and reduce its own\nliabilities and thus save money. If you\nsee a scourge of, 'switch lights off after\nyou' stickers, you know why.\nStaff Student protocols are a familiar\nfeature of most Student Unions. The\nbroad understanding is: If staff give\nstudents impartial advice they don't want\nto get dragged in to student politics. One\nbroad objection from this Felix Editor\nis that student media would then not be\nallowed to comment on permanent staff.\nFor example, if a member of staff was\ndoing something wrong, media would\nnot be able to identify it.\nCCUs are at the moment broadly\nsubservient to ICU, with the exception\nof St Mary's. Any 'definition' of a CCU's role would mean all of them being\nbrought under the banner and\nresponsibility of ICU.\nPage 11\n\n"

Troy Tremeloeinvestigates the world of Dod gy Covers, 'Unlikely'\nCollaborations, and doin' lots a work for charity\nIf you'd been listening to the radio\non April 13, you may have heard\nthe result of a rather unusual\ncollaboration between the arch\nAnglo-American Girl/Boy band\nVoice of the Beehive, and the shorn,\nslight synth-pop balladeer Jimmy\nSomerville running their fingers\nover an old Stones classic from way\nbefore year zero. The song was\n1969's Altamont anthem, 'Gimme\nShelter'. Keith Richards was to\nadmit later that he had lifted it from\na symphony by Beethoven which,\napparently, was his standard\npractice behind the creation of a good many Rolling Stones songs. It\nwas later covered, with judicious\nrewriting, by the Sisters of Mercy\nin 1983, and featured on the B side\nof 'Temple of Love', their last\nindependent 12\" release before\nsigning to WE A and becoming a dod gy would-be corporate rock\nband.\nThe bizarrely straight-laced Food/EMI release for Putting Our\nBeehive/Somerville cover is only House In Order, a charity project\none of many to feature on a for the homeless initiated by Jon\nBeast, lately MC of Carter USM,\nmedia courtier extra ordinaire, and\nall-round blok e. Other versions of\n'Gimme Shelter' (there are some\ntwelve in total) feature such names\nas Heaven 17, Tom Jones, Sandie\nShaw, New Model Army, 808 State,\nHawkwind (with Sam Fox, believe\nit or not), PWEI, and a rare live\nversion by the Rolling Stones\nthemselves. What is most evident\nabout this is the way Jon Beast,\nalong with Andy Ross (Food\nrecords) and David Woolfson\n(Parliament Management), is\nattempting to bridge what we might\ncall the tribal gaps between, say,\nheavy metal, dance, indie rock, and\nthe broader pop audience. There are\nfour different releases; the pop\ncassette, the dance 12\", the\nalternative CD, and the rock CD. The Altamont soundtrack, Gimme Shelter. Covered by New Model Army with Tom Jones Kingmaker PWEI\nit's just a shot away\nIt isn't just that they're trying to\ncover every angle, be it metal, pop,\ndance, whatever your bag is; nor is\nit purely the good cause that is the\ngreat thing about Putting Our House\nIn Order. That these are all superb\nversions of one of the Stones' best\never songs (if you don't know it, it\nranks along with 'Sympathy for the\nDevil', and 'Goodbye Ruby\nTuesday', and if you don't know\nthose, you are a donkey) is its\nqualification, and the reason to buy\n'Gimme Shelter'.\nAside from this, a video is now\navailable, featuring all the artists in\na( if you will) 'rockumentary', and\na series of concerts, comedy shows,\nand a fashion show have taken place\nover the past few months. We did\ntell you a few months back, so don't tell us you weren't informed.\nFurthermore, there is an auction\nnext week at the Phillips Auction\nRooms, 10 Salem Road, W2. If that\nisn't good enough for you, it's just\noff Queensway; you know,\nBayswater. Paddington. Up there.\nSo don't forget, it's the 18th of\nMay, and there's some handsome\nhunks of pop memorabilia going to\nthe highest bidder. Oh, and by the\nway, if you want to know more\nabout Putting Our House In Order,\nhow you can contribute, even the\nspecific details of the auction items\n(Boots from PJ Harvey, knickers\nfrom L7, Gold Lame stage suit\nfrom Cliff Richard among them)\ncall into the Felix office and ask for\nme, Kevin Courvoisier.

    "content": "Feature\nDeath to the Travelcard!\nFelix 966 14 May 1993\nThe coming months will see the end of London buses as we know them\nMimi Chakraborty examines the casualties on the deck.\nFor a Government apparently\nunable to dist in gish between a banana skin and a relatively\nharmless bit of pavement, the\nproposed deregulation of London's bus service may prove another\nopportunity to slip up.\nPlans for deregulation were set\nout in the Government consultation\ndocument entitled ' A Bus Strategy\nfor London ' which was released in\nMarch 1991. It came as part of the\nlast of a raft of privatisation\nproposals which began with British\nTelecom in the late eighties. Sadly,\nunlike Vanessa Williams, they\nneglected to leave the best till last,\nand the privatisation initiatives\nremaining - British Coal, British\nRail and The Royal Mail, have been\namongst the most contentious of any\nproposed.\nWhile Transport Secretary John\nMacGregor has had his skills as a magic-circle magician severely\ntested in trying to make British Rail\nchairman Sir Bob Reid completely\ndisappear, his deputy minister\nSteven Norris has been trying to sell\nbus deregulation with a similar lack\nof success.\nThe plans have been opposed by\nthe Association of London\nAuthorities and the London\nBorough's Association, the bodies\nwho currently have statutory\nresponsibility for the design and\nimplementation of traffic\nmanagement. They cite 'inevitable\nchaos and confusion' and 'lack of\nan integrated system of\nconcessionary fares' as their\nprincipal criticisms.\nBoth of these have significant\nimplications for the would-be\ncommuter.\nSimply explained the process of\nderegulation will lift the statutory\nconstraint on London Transport to\nprovide a bus service in London and\nopens the way for private\ncompanies to compete for\nwhichever routes they choose. Once\nthe deregulation process is\nunderway the privatisation of\nLondon's buses will follow. The\ndepartment of Transport plans to\ncomplete both operations by the end\nof the next parliamentary session.\nThe worst case scenario is of a free-for-all between an unknown\nnumber of bus companies\ncompeting for the same customers\nat the same bus-stops on the same\nroutes at the same time, clogging up\nthe city's networks for themselves\nand other road traffic. While the\nGovernment assures us that this will\nnot happen, precedents for\nderegulation are not encouraging.\nThe West Midlands,\nWolverhampton, Sheffield,\nManchester and Oxford have all\nderegulated their bus services with\nrelative degrees of success.\nSignificantly, fares have risen by a third, services have been unreliable,\nlower wage costs have reduced\noperating costs but FEWER people\nare using the buses.\nCoordination between bus\nservices and other modes of\ntransport has reduced and coordinated ticket-schemes have been\ndifficult to maintain.\nIn London, the effect of\nderegulation which all sides are\nagreed upon, is the ultimate demise\nof the Travelcard. Currently around\neighty-three percent of London's commuters use LRT to travel. Of\nthese only ten percent use only\nbuses. Many use a combination of\nbus, tube, and British Rail for\nwhich the fixed price Travelcard\nand season tickets offer substantial\neconomies. There appears to be no\nway of compelling competing\ncompanies to involve themselves in\na through-ticketing system with\neach other, so commuters may be\nrestricted by having to buy tickets\nwhich would be valid for only on\ncompany.\nThe government are considering\nthe introduction of an electronic\nSMART card which can be valid\nfor more than one company, but this\nwill still have a cumulative charge-per-journey, unlike the one-price\nexisting system.\nRepresentatives of the\nAssociation of London Authorities,\nthe London Regional Passenger\nCommittee and the London\nBorough's association, told the all-party Transport Select Committee\nof their concerns. Also invited to\nattend were representatives of the\nTransport and General Worker's Union, who expressed concern\nabout the pay and conditions of their\nmembers after deregulation.\nTransport Minister Stephen\nNorris staunchly defended his\nplans though, promising that\nderegulation will 'help ensure that\nthe best bus is operated on the right\nroute.' At the end of a lengthy and\nenthusiastic interview he was,\nhowever, forced to concede that\nthere would be salary\n' re negotiations', driver-number\n'changes' and fare 'realisation s'. This probably means that there will\nbe cut-price party rates for\npassengers, many more conductors\nthan it takes to change a lightbulb,\nand a pay increase for operators in\nline with currency speculators.\nPerversely, however, the T GWU elected to adopt just the kind of\ngloomy view of proceedings which\nhas given the unions a bad name.\nWhatever the success of one-day\nbus strikes in the city, the\nconsultation period is drawing to a close and expectations are that the\nderegulation process will\ncommence in the spring. After\nsoliciting views from interested\nparties the DoT will come to a conclusion. In this context the word\n'consultation' is elevated to almost\nenigmatic status, but like the smile\nof the Mona Lisa, it may mean\nsomething, but then again it may\nmean nothing at all.\nIn the last few moments of the\nselect committee's meeting a lone\nvoice amongst the MP's enquired\n'What attempts have been made to\nsolicit passenger views ? ' Alas, it\nseemed no-one had remembered to\nask.\n\n"

Inside, if\nrumours are to be believed, are\nsome pictures of flowers by the\nAmerican Georgia O 'Keeffe.\nHowever, my true holy grail is the\nwork of the other featured artist,\nJames Turrell. Flyer, perceptual\npsychologist and hollower-out of\nextinct volcanoes, Turrell has\nbecome renowned for creating\npsycho dramatic visual experiences\nwhich have to be seen to be\nbelieved. So, with a veritable\ncluster of expectations, I bypassed\nthe flower paintings and leapt three\nsteps at a time up to the higher\nreaches of the gallery. The first\nroom simply contains large spidery\naerial photographs of the extinct\nvolcano which Turrell is converting\nto an 'unique observatory of the\nheavens'. A few minutes glance at\nthese is enough and then it's on to\nthe constructions themselves. For\nthe first, ' Air Mass', you head\nFelix 966\nthrough a wooden passage into a large room. It's square, white\nwalled, with a square screen in the\nceiling. Suddenly you realise that\nthe screen is actually the sky, and\nthere's just a hole. The effect is\ndisconcerting at first but becomes\nrelaxing, meditative. The sky seems\nclose and two dimensional, like a picture. There are seats where you\ncan watch it for a while, or just sun\nyourself and read the brochure.\nThe story becomes bizarre at this\npoint. To see the other two exhibits\nyou have to queue until a guard\nallows you in. 'Keep your hand on\nthe left wall', he says...Suddenly,\nyou're in darkness. You cannot see\na thing. You freak out with the\nonset of claustrophobia, but don't panic, just think yourself lucky;\nprevious installations have involved\nswimming through underwater\npassages or being hoisted on\nplatforms. You follow the wall\naround a corner and enter\n'Wedgework IV. This one is\nSTRANGE. A room, and a large\nhole in the wall with red light. 'The\nfires of hell', someone says. It can't be described, you just have to see\nit. Down through more darkness to\nthe final, and best, exhibit. This\nroom is dimly lit, with a window at\nthe end.

You stare,\nand see mist, a void. No walls, no\ndarkness, just this space. Keep\nstaring and the mist closes around\nyou, you get sucked in. However\nhard you search for some detail or\nflaw you find none. It's very quiet,\nfrightening. You become calm as\nyour mind drifts...Don't watch for\ntoo long or you'll never return.\nThat's what James Turrell does.\nIt can't really be described, but he\nsays about his work and philosophy,\n'Light is not so much revealed, as\nit is itself the revelation'.\nThe advertised artist, Georgia\nO 'Keeffe has been described as\nAmerica's most popular 20th century artist. Throughout the\nearlier part of this century she\ndevoted her time to painting\nlandscapes, bones and abstracts, but\nis best remembered for her large\npictures of flowers. The exhibition\nhere shows the variety of her work\nfrom early abstract sketches to\nmany of her later, more impressive\npieces. Many of her paintings have\na beautiful simplicity to them which\nwas inspired by oriental aesthetic\nprinciples, and they are well worth\nseeing if you're interested.\nHowever, the showing here was\ndissatisfying in that, by\nconcentrating on the history and\ndevelopment of her work, many of\nthe paintings shown are rather dull\ncompared to her best works. Still,\nthe tranquility in her paintings is a good way of forgetting exam stress.\nSo, if you want a break from work\nto spend an hour or two in a state\nof visual meditation it's well worth\npaying the extortionate entrance fee\nto trip out at the Hayward gallery.\nM.A. \u2022 Hayward Gallery from 8 April\nto 27 June.\n^Theatre\n7 can see the pub from here!\nHills\nBlue Remembered Hills\nSeven children played by seven\nadults; this play sounds a bit weird\nand I was right to think so when I discovered that the scribe was\nDennis Potter. But the\nperformances are so convincing that\nI thought that the seven actors were\nreally children that were simply\noversized.\nIt is set in war time Britain, in the\nwest country. The male children are\nobsessed by guns, war, knives,\nviolence etc, and surprisingly so are\nthe female children on a few\noccasions! It starts out cheery\nenough with the seven youngsters\nplaying various games. And then\nthe tragedy sets in towards the end\nand the terror of the 'disaster' is\na youngster cries from Blue Remembered\nvery convincing and for a moment,\nquite frightening.\nAll the characters were composed\nof various child stereotypes that\nhave been used by other writers, but\nDennis Potter has managed to\npresent them in such a way that they\ndon't seem tired and worn out.

    "content": "Feature\n14 May 1993\nOver the Easter vacation, a team\nfrom the Imperial College Yacht\nClub mounted a concerted effort to\ncompete in and win the Spi\nDauphine '93.\nThe Spi Dauphine race series,\nheld over eight days, consists of five\nraces: two 99 nautical mile races\nbetween Port Vendres in France\nand Barcelona in Spain, two\nOlympic triangle races, and an\nevent specially developed for the\nSpi Dauphine, the 'Dolphin's Dance', a24 hour relay. Although\ndown somewhat in numbers this\nyear, with only 66 boats in\nattendance compared with the\nprevious year's110, the Spi\nnevertheless was as exciting, and as\nit turned out, as dangerous as it\nalways is.\nDespite six months of fruitless\nsponsorship-hunting, and despite\ncosts in the order of \u00a310,000, the\nIC team of 10, many of whom are\nin their last year at college, was\ndetermined to compete. With help\nfrom the Marketing Department,\nSir Eric Ash the rector, Prof John\nArcher the pro-rector, Angus\nFraser, and a very generous loan\nfrom the Old Centralians Trust\nFund, the crew members Justin\nAlexander, Thor Askeland, Rick\nBilby, Matt Crossman, Maria\nMoratis, Thomas Muller,\nEmmanuel Omont, Tim Parsons,\nNils Rasmilovic, and Marcus\nSchmitt, each signed up for \u00a3600 of\ndebt to allow the best possible boat\nto be hired and to ensure that the\nteam had the utmost opportunity to\nex cell in the race series. Marcus\nSchmitt also personally committed\n\u00a32,500 as a deposit to secure our\nbooking of the high-performance\nJeanneau One-Design boat that we\nrented, and his father printed team\nt shirts and rugby jumpers for the\nwhole crew and shipped them over\nfrom Hong-Kong in time for the\nrace. With Marcus' leadership and\nvision right at the outset, we\nmanaged to avoid almost all the\nreefs and snags that usually\naccumulate to make such projects\nas the Spi Dauphine impossible.\nIn addition to all the above, a crew support team also invested\ntime and money in the series. The\nteam in Port Vendres consisted of\nLiz Carr and Lynda Davies, who\nwere absolutely crucial for crew\nmorale and spirit towards the end\nof the series, and Chris Moreton\nwho is doing his MEng placement\nin Barcelona, took time off work to\npick up the pieces of wretched\nhumanity that arrived there after the\nfirst race up from Port Vendres. We\nhope we didn't drive his Spanish\nflat mates, Christian and Marcus,\ntotally up the wall, they also gave\nus tremendous hospitality.\nFelix 966\nFive of the crew arrived a week\nbefore the event started, partly\nbecause the boat had to be delivered\nto Port Vendres for the start, and\npartly for extra experience. The\nrace series began on Saturday 16th April, 1993, and lasted until the\nfollowing Saturday. By the Friday\nmorning beforehand, the 15th April, all ten members of the crew\nhad finally arrived, and in strong\nwinds, the boat had proved itself to\nbe a radical yet forgiving\nperformer, hitting 14.7 knots\nsurfing down a wave with only the\ntwice-reefed mainsail aloft.\nThe race fleet was divided into\ncompany boats and student boats,\nand having no sponsor, we were\ndesignated as a company boat to\nanother yacht racing grandes\necoles, Assas of Paris. ImperialAssas was our team, and there were\n33 teams in all. Each race was run\nwith the two fleets, 33 yachts\napiece.\nAnd so, on Saturday evening,\nwith a confused chop in the sea, a stiff 25 knot Northerly, and an even\nmore confusing weather forecast,\nwe windward mark before turning,\npopping the heavy spinnaker, and\nsurfing off South towards Barcelona\n99 nautical miles away. As darkness\nfell, the magnificent sight of the\nfleet disappeared, to be replaced by\nfaint, swaying lights just above a barely sensed horizon. We sailed on\nwith two or three other boats around\nus. Screams of delight as waves\nwere caught and surfed were the\nonly reminders that there were other\npeople out here in the darkness.\nLoneliness and fear did not occur\nto us nor encroach on our excited\ndiscussions of wind, sail trimming\nnavigation, and the opposition\nyachts.\nAfter five hours of rushing\ndownwind, at about 2.30am, we\npassed the checkpoint in third\nposition. We were buzzed at how\nwell we had done, and were looking\nforward to knocking off the other\nboats in front of us. Suddenly,\nhowever, the wind dropped\ncompletely and we were becalmed.\nFor the next two hours, we drifted\ninto and out of Southerly puffs of\nwind. The fleet that we had earlier\nleft far behind caught up with us and\nthe other leading yachts and were\nbecalmed in turn. Everything and\neverybody was still. 'No\nunnecessary movements please.'\nWe looked for wind. Tactical\ndecision time: sometimes there are\ngusts at night which fall off the\nland. We decide to go closer\ntowards the coast, and begin\nmoving from gust patch to gust\npatch. This keeps us up with the\nleading boats farther out to sea, and\nalthough tired and cold, we feel\ngood. Dawn begins to break, and\nsuddenly we are in a dead patch. No\nwind, Shivering, we wait for any\nbreeze to stir while the boats out to\nsea begin to catch up and move\npast. Uh oh hh. Five hours later, after watching\nalmost the entire fleet sail past us\nus while we lay in the hot morning\nsun crying and weeping at black\nfate, the wind finally stirred us on.\nAll day we tacked against the\nSoutherly breeze, until at last, at\n7.30pm, we arrived at Barcelona,\n15th out of the two fleets of boats,\nand fully 24 hours after leaving Port\nVendres. Only the sight of Chris\nMoreton waiting to greet us on the\ndock side stopped some team\nmembers from throwing themselves\ninto the filthy harbour in despair at\nour pathetic result.\nThe next day was fresh and\nsunny, and the second race, an\nOlympic triangle event, was held.\nThe yachts had to race around a short course as fast as possible. We\nwere all still disgusted with the\nprevious day's result, and a bloody-minded determination began to\nsuffuse the whole team. The race\nstarted very well for us, and from\nthat point on, we sailed perfectly.\nDespite a long tussle with the big\nbene a teau from the Total team, we\nwon! First place! At last our Spi\nDauphine had truly started, and we\nhad won some respect for ourselves\nand Imperial College! That night,\nwe totally forgot the first race and\ncelebrated!\nBut it wasn't forgotten for long.\nThe next morning at 8am, we\nstarted the .next race, back to Port\nVendres! The pace of the races\nbegan to feel a little punishing, but\nonce again we got a good start, and\nset off with a gentle Southerly\nbehind us and the light spinnaker.\nWe sailed all day, tussling with the\nother ten Jeanneau One-Designs.\nBlack clouds rolled up from behind,\nand we all donned our wet-weather\ngear in anticipation of some heavy\ngusts. Finally they hit and we\nburned forward on the waves,\nsurfing to 12.5 knots, but with\nother, less careful boats, wiping out\nand broaching badly beside us.\nSpectacular stuff!\nWe rache d the checkpoint 8 hours\nafter leaving Barcelona, and we\nducked in closer to the coast to pass\nby the committee boat and show our\nsail numbers. Then, moving back\nout to sea, we hooked into some\nstronger wind, and concentrated on\nsurfing the final 30 miles to Port\nVendres as fast as possible. Night\nfell as a dolphin played alongside\nour boat, and then we.\nNobody will forget the last five\nmiles. With the wind strengthening\nand shifting to the East, and with\nthe light spinnaker still flying and\nPage 12\nImperial at\nSpi Dauphine\nthreatening to explode, we shy\nreached across the last big bay\ntowards Cape Bear, just around the\ncorner from Post Vendres.\nEverybody was sitting at the back\nof the boat, as far to leeward as they\ncould manage. Then, it was our turn\nto wipe out, a sudden wave lifting\nthe rudder clear of the water and\ncausing us to totally lose control.\nThe spinnaker flapped madly as the\nyacht crashed onto its side, dead in\nthe water. Slowly she righted\nherself, the mast came up, the sails\nsnapped full with wind, and we s hol off again like a dinghy, hitting 12\nknots in sec on as. in t ne next five\nminutes, we wiped out four times\nin the pitch darkness. Everybody\nwas calm however, totally in\ncontrol of dur selves and\nconcentrating terrifically on every\nmoment of this last dash. By\npushing so hard, we slipped inside\nfour other boats, and when finally\nwe rounded the point and dropped\nour spinnaker to cross the line, we\nwere in third place! Excellent! And\nwe had left Barcelona only 12 hours\nand 30 minutes before! We danced\nand laughed and drank past ice, and\nthough we were totally knacker ed, we didn't feel a thing.\nThe following day, no events\nwere scheduled, and we all rested\ngratefully. A quick two-hour sail\nwas all we could manage before we\nsettled back into our sombre mood,\ncontemplating the next race. The\nbreeze had settled down from the\nprevious night's strength, but all\nday, nobody could forget our dash\ndown from Barcelona and the\nexcitement of the last five miles.\nWe were not in 8th place overall.\nWe wanted to do better...\nUnsetded skies, choppy seas, and\na light to moderate Easterly breeze\nawaited us at the start of the fourth\nrace, another triangle race. We got\nanother good start, and tacked up\nto the windward mark easily\namongst the front boats, but\nrounding the mark and heading\ndownwind, we realised that the light\nspinnaker we hauled up had been\nbadly stretched and we took away\nsome stability. The other boats had\nperhaps a quarter-knot speed\nadvantage downwind, and it was\nenough to make us fall behind the\nlead boats slightly. We caught up\nagain going up wind, but found it\nimpossible to overtake the first four\nyachts. With a strange feeling of\nanticlimax, we crossed the finish\nline two hours after the start in 5th place.\nHow would our position be\naffected? How well had we done in\nthe overall stakes? We would have\nto wait until the following day\nbefore the new results would be\nposted, but by then, the Dolphin's Felix 966\nDance would be well underway...\nThe Dolphin's Dance. What a diabolical invention. Not just a relay\nrace, but a24 hour relay race. Each\nteam of two yachts, (in our case,\nourselves and Assas of Paris), had\n24 hours to complete as many laps\nas possible of a simple 12 mile long\n'sausage-shaped' course. With the\nwind at 30 knots gusting to 45, it\npromised to be a very tough race,\nand, we predicted that it would be\ncancelled, or at least postponed.\nIt wasn't. The start occurred at\n13.00 hours on the final day, and\nAssas went first. We waited in port,\nlistening to the constant flow of\nradio traffic and information,\nlistening for that fateful call:\n'Froggies to Ros Biffs, Froggies\nto Ros Biffs, 'arf and 'ow a hr to go!'\nWhen it came, we scram be ld into\nour yacht and shot out of the harb ur, heading towards the dual start-finish\nline. We had to time our start so as\nto cross the line as soon as our\nteam-mates crossed their finish line.\n'There she is!' Assas' teak decks\nidentified her immediately as she\nheeled over hard and tacked up to\nthe line. The committee boat blew\ntheir horn as we crossed the line\ntogether, waved, and then turned\nand headed off downwind towards\nthe mark.\nSuddenly, we were racing again.\nThe heavy spinnaker went up, and\nimmediately, the two-metre high\nwaves and strong winds took hold\nof the boat. Conservative spinnaker\ntrimming and careful hel ming was\nall that stopped us from wiping out\nas we surfed on the waves, hitting\n14.7 knots at one point. The bow\nwould disappear underwater as we\ncaught each wave, and fountains of\nwater poured back to hit the cockpit\nbefore draining over the stern and\njoining our motor-boat-like wake.\nOne wave caught us badly...'I 've\nlost it! Hang on everyone!', Thor\ninformed us calmly. Everyone was\nso excited, we actually enjoyed the\nwipeout, even though any gear\nbreakages would cost Us at least\n\u00a3100 each. The spinnaker and rig\nheld though, and we snapped back\nup to speed. We travelled six miles\nin 28 minutes. Suddenly, the mark\nwas coming up really fast.\nDropping the spinnaker was\nachieved with much swearing,\ngrunting, prayer, and desperation,\nbut finally, we rounded the mark\nand began tacking up towards Port\nVendres. T would sell my mother\nto do that again!' was the general\nfeeling on board.\nAn hour later, after tacking hard\nup through the heavy swell, we\nneared the finish line. The little\nJeanneau One-Design was\nperforming beautifully, and we\nwere proud of our performance.\nPoor Assas, though, had hardly had\na half an hour of rest in the port\n'eat ure14 May 1993\nbefore we neared the finish line and\ncalled them back out. We passed on\nanother on the start-finish line\nagain, and relaxed a little making\nit into port, with a feeling of\nenervation suffusing everyone.\nStill, there was at least another 21\nhours to go. This race was not going\nto be easy.\nWe rested for another hour, and\nthen the call from Assas came\nagain. This time, 'We are ten\nminutes from the fine es h line!'\nHell's teeth!! We got out of Port\nVendres and had the sails up in\nunder four minutes, definitely a record. Assas had underestimated\nthe time it was going to tack them,\nthough, luckily, and waited another\n15 minutes before beginning our\nrun down to the mark once more.\nIn fact, the wind had lightened up\nnear the start-finish line, but\ndeviously, had strengthened by five\nknots as one got closer to the mark.\nOnce again, we began to surf, no\nless in control, but with the yacht\nriding the knife edge between\nsurfing the wave and wiping out.\nWe slipped over to the other side\nof that edge for a moment, and we\nwere gone again, roaring up into the\nwind. This time, the yacht would\nnot come back around for nearly a minute, before she snapped\nviciously back into the wind. The\ngame was .over, and things were\ngetting serious. Several other yachts\nthat were returning to the start line\nbore the scars of damage. Here a ripped mainsail, there a yacht with\na broken boom, and there the last\npiece of a torn spinnaker dangling\nfrom the top of the mast like a badge\nof valour.\nAs we rounded the mark and\ntacked back up to the start-finish\nline, we knew that someone was\ngoing to realise that the conditions\nwere becoming too dangerous. If\nwe were finding the going tough\nwith our modern yacht, what would\nhappen to others who were sailing\nmuch more venerable craft? Sure\nenough, as soon as we called Assas\nto tell them we were nearing the\nline, we were told. Finish this lap,\nand then everything is finished. We\nwere relieved, but a little sad too.\n24 hours of that kind of sailing\nwould have killed us, but it would\nhave been an experience. At least\nwe had finished in the top ten teams\nfor the event. The Spi Dauphine '93\nwas over.\nFinal Results (out of 66 vessels):\n1st race 15th( Port-Vendres to\nBarcelona), 2nd race 1st( Triangle\nof Barcelona), 3rd race 3rd( Barcelona to Port-Vendres), 4th race 5th( Triangle off PortVendres), 5th race top ten\n(Dolphin's Dance 24 hour relay).\nOverall Result: Team 8th( with\nAssas of Paris), Individual 5th( out\nof 66 vessels).\nPage 13\n\n"

A combination of warm weather,\nsunshine and fun made the event the busiest for years. Stalls included\nwheelchair racing, laser shoot, jelly races, the cocktail dash, plus those\nold favourites candy floss, jelly and ice cream, and banana splits.\nThe day was wrapped up by the presentation of cheques to this year's Rag charities.

Next\nWednesday will see the publication\nof the key document putting flesh\non proposals for the most radical\nstructural shake up since the Union\nwas founded at the start of the\ncentury.\nThe outline proposals, flagged in\nlast week's Felix, were passed in\nprinciple at this Monday's meeting\nof ICU Council. The 55-member\nCouncil will be abolished as the\nmanagement body of the Union.\nThe current ICU Executive, a branch of the old Council, will also\nbe scrapped.\nTheir proposed replacement is a new 13 member executive\ncommittee. This committee will\ninclude new officer posts, and will\ninvolve modifications to several\nothers that already exist. This new\nExecutive will also have\nconsiderably more powers than its\npredecessor, as it will be a branch\nof the Union General Meeting\n(UGM). Whilst the U GM will\nremain the sovereign decision-making body, the new Executive\nwill find extensive powers delegated\nto it, making it in effect responsible\nfor the 'hands on management' of\nthe Union.\nThe new executive will comprise\na President, a Deputy President\n(Finance and Services), a Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies), a City and Guilds Constituent Union\nPresident, a Royal College of\nScience Union President, a Royal\nSchool of Mines President, a St\nMary's Hospital Medical School\nUnion President, an Overseas\nOfficer, a Welfare Chairman, an\nAcademic Affairs Officer, an\nEntertainments Officer, a Postgraduate Chairman, and a Communications Officer.\nJob descriptions for these\nexecutive posts will be one of\nseveral specific details to be\nrevealed in next Wednesday's document. The Deputy President\n(Finance and Services) appear to be\na simple re tiding of the existing post\nof Deputy President. The current\npost of Honorary Secretary (Events)\nis to be split into two jobs: an\nEvents Manager, a full time paid\nUnion staff post; and a Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies), a sabbatical who will have a largely\nrepresentative role, and who will be\nexpected to nurture Union societies.\nThe new Events Manager will be\npaid from Union funds, but the\ncandidate will be expected to raise\nenough money in a year to justify\nthe salary. The Events Manager\nwill organise the Careers Fair and\nthe Union May Ball, both lucrative\nmoney earners for the Union. The\nManager will also organise the\nUnion's entertainments and events,\nand market them externally and to\nUnion members. Organised events\nnormally serve to increase bar and\nsnack bar takings at slack times,\nsuch as weekends, and Union\nfigures expect the combination of\nregular and special events to\ngenerate more than the salary\nneeded for this new staff member.\nElections papers for the so far\nnewly-titled post of Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies)\nwent up this week. The job title on\nthe papers was changed with the\napproval of Council, pending a further decision on the specifics of\nthe job description. Changes to the\njob description depend on the\napproval of the new Events\nManager staff post. The Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies) is\nexpected to be left with a radically\nrestructured role, including the\norganisation of the Freshers' Fair\nand Overseas Students' Reception\nDay, attending Club and Society\nmeetings, promoting the sporting\nachievements of Union clubs and to\nseek sponsorship for them, and to\n6 7 9 11/12\nSexy Rag Death of Sailing\nSabb Fete the Buses to Victory\n\n"

The teams were divided\nup into four mixed leagues of 12\neach, and two ladies leagues of nine\neach, the races were all sailed in\nLarks and Laser 2's dinghies.\nThe squall y and gusty weather on\nTuesday was far from ideal, with\nsurvival sailing being the order of\nthe day and races won by the team\nwhich managed to avoid capsize.

The\nfact that on that day I did not exactly\nacquit myself journalistic ally speaking, I decide to keep to\nrespectful, grave-consigning way\nmost of its leftovers have extolled\nfor the past 13-14 years. He claims\nno special motivation behind his\nlyrics, and succeeds in transmitting\nlaunching headlong into his\n'Hieronymus Bosch' question. His\nsmall beard quivers as .Wiz's answer, 'I liked it, and we got it\ncheap' fires back with devastating\nMega City 4 as if they've got something to laugh about\nI dunno; sometimes people really\ntalk a load of bollocks, don't they?\nThat this is one such occasion is\nquite beyond any wish I may have\nto do any different. The fucking\ndisk drive is whining its pain-in-the-arse best, even those I generally\nconsider to be the apex of humanity\nhave proved capable of being\nunreliable wan kers, and I am dying\nfor a cigarette. Add that to the\namount of shits who fail to grasp\nthat reading things over other\npeople's shoulders is really fucking\nrude, and you may surmise that I am probably not your best choice\nfor looking after your loaded AK47\nKalashnikow while you take the\nkids fishing. Would that I could\nkick you all individually in the face\ninstead of writing this shit.\nSo, perhaps I am not in the best\nframe of mind to report on the ship\nof state of one Mega City 4,\nland marking trekkers of 'Sebastopol\nRoad' and the embodiment of the\nrevenge of the crust ies, but (Oh\ngod, you're not going to say 'I'm a professional' again, are you? - sic.\nEd) oh, nothing. Stop me if I get too\nindulgent, won't you.\nThus, we find ourselves in a pub\nup Ladbroke Grove, drinking and\nchattering nervously. Most of the\nother hacks here are from fanzines,\nleaving us to anticipate the\ninevitable embarrassment of being\nseen to know little about our\nsubject. I ask my colleague what\nquestion he's going to ask, and he\nsays that it will probably feature the\nwords 'Album cover', 'Hieronymus\nBosch' and 'Why?'. I nod. Good\none, I say. That'll fool them. He\nasks me the same question, and I shrug, saying 'Oh, motivations, I suppose... Maybe something on the\nPOHIO thing'. We congregate\nbelow in a small room with beers\nand complementary records; people\nwander through to drink by the\ncanal, effectively blowing the\nsanctity of this conference to the\nwind. Smart. An even more\nnervous hack asks in terrified,\nhushed tones, 'have you ever done\nthis sort of thing before?'. I nod\nheroically, a figure of experience,\nmyself.\nThe conference is called open.\nIt has become very quiet, very quiet\nindeed. One of the band says 'Well,\nwe're more nervous than you', and,\naside from having no qualification\nwhatsoever to make that statement,\nit would seem to get the proceedings\nunder way. Encouraged, the young\nsnapper beside us launches himself\nwith his ace. T know someone's got\nto ask the first question, and I suppose...' We could just sit back,\nhave a beer, cultivate a rapport with\ndr iii king contests and recounting s of\nsexual escapades, couldn't we?\nQuite evidently not. They are asked\nquestions about the media machine,\nwhether the future for them lies in\nFanzine coverage, and their\nnecessary reliance on fanzines for\nprecisely that purpose. A fragile\nsliver of a question about punk rock\ngets through (I don't know; does\nno-one vet these things any more?\n- sic. Ed), and Wiz, that is, the\nskeleton in the dreads, opens his\npolite eulogy on punk in the\na nervous smile to give the\nimpression that his lyrical\npersuasions are both bleeding\nobvious and, in fact, the first things\nthat come in to his head.\nMore navel ly oriented fanzine\nquestions later (do you like\nfanzines? do you read them? Aren't they so much better than our\nnational music press? Isn't Everett\nTrue awan ker?),I chirrup in with\nthe right here n' happen in' Putting\nOur House In Order question,\nwhether they've been involved,\nbeen asked, been shagged by Jon\n'Fat' Beast, and all for charity.\nThey have (eh, readers?), they will,\nand they respect Jon Beast. 'We'd do anything for him, and he'd do\nanything for anyone. Started us off,\nhe did', they recall with tears in\ntheir eyes. 'Encouraged us, told us\nnever to give up, told us we were\nsomething special', they sob into\ntheir beer. I'm moved. 'What an\nevil, vicious bastard...' I say to my\ncolleague. He in turn nods sadly,\nbefore whipping up a frenzy and\nspeed. These are aggressive\nmoments. 'And..' continues Wiz,\n'it seems to say everything about\n'Sebastopol Road\"\nPhew. Sigh of relief. We have\ncontributed, and in a pretty\nsubstantial way. Naah, who am I kidding. We went to get waz zed on\nthe cheap. And we did. Cheers,\nGinny.\nThe conference closes down with\na smack of informality and more\nbottled lagers, and the sounds from\nabove are of the Wonderstuff\ncovering the Jam, their most\npretentiously 'sensitive', acoustic\nmoment ever. I 'll stay down here,\nthanks. They're nice guys, and we\ngot free beer. Nuff said. I depart\nmoments after my collaborator has\nalready done so. Pop stars? Only\ninasmuch as Wiz signing his album\nfor me, and that's only out of\nrevenge. I signed my book for him\nfirst. That, as Morrissey, Miles and\nMr Weller have already\nendeavour ed to tell us, ' is entertainment.\nPage 19\n\n"

But, you must see my\ndilemma: Someone writes nearly\n10,000 words of text, lovingly\ndescribing a time which left a clear\nimpression and then allows it to just\ndisappear. It doesn't require much\nintellect to see that there has been\nsome pressure applied to the writer.\nI would like to know why? It was\na completely harmless piece of\nwriting, what else would force\nanyone to withdraw it?\nCredits\nNews: Andrew Tseng, Declan.\nFeature: Mimi, Yachting Club.\nReviews Donny, Phil, Gareth PH, Sonia, Tintin.

I think many people are\nfairly curious as to what St Mary's is really like.\nI also think it was very impressive\nof Felix to find such an article and\nprint it.\nIs it not also true that the article's author, although presently at St\nMary's, previously studied at\nImperial for three years?\nJust goes to show. Once an\nImperial student; always aw anker. Morton.\nEditorial\nOn the rare occasion that a token of\nrecognition happens to find its way\nover to South Kensington from St\nMary's, it is grabbed with both\nhands and cherished for its rarity.\nSuch was my reaction when I received a huge article from\nsomeone at St Mary's writing about\nhis (or her) first year at the\nPaddington Medical School. It was\nfunny, long and could have kept me\nfrom having to look for another\nfeature for weeks. In other words,\nI liked it. So, lo and behold, I publish the first double page spread\nof the offending literature in last\nweek's issue of Felix.\nCome Monday morning I receive\na phone call explaining that the\nauthor wishes to withdraw the\narticle. Sure, No problem, it is his\n(or her) own work, but why? People\nhad been offended by it, the author\nhad checked with a number of the\npeople concerned in the story, and\nthey had OKed it. Until, the actual\narticle was printed, then of course,\neveryone complained. I happened to\ntalk to Marc Swan, President of St\nMary's, he also thought the article\nshould not have been printed,\nbecause some of the characters\ncould be identified. Then I received\nCat's Eyes\nRed Cross Week Have I done this before? Feelings\nof Deja vu I think. Oh well, lets\npress on.\nAnother famous charity is giving\nits contribution to the fashion\nworld. The item that will be in\nvogue, if it isn't already, is a red\ncross, available from, well, almost\neverywhere it seems. From the\nviewpoint of its beneficiaries, who\ncares why people buy them. But is\nthat what charity has resorted to?\nCreating hypes only to exploit them\nfor good means?\nCoded Space Filler\n'dni meh t dna dna he ht nee w te bgn id nats red nu on eb nac ere ht, tre a he ht tuo h tiW' Election Results\nWith the disaster at the by-elections\nover a week ago, isn't it about time\nthat the chancellor was sacked?

It clearly\nmeans that the magazine I have the\nhonour of editing has a near divine\nstatus for Medical students. Such is\nthe reaction against this small event\nthat I am forced to ignore the given\nexplanation as a sham and that one\nof three conclusions are possible:\nThat Felix is so popular at St\nMary's, that the appearance of an\nextensive article about the Medical\nSchool caused a near riot. The\nscenes of celebration at being\nrecognised by the College magazine\nwere so outrageous that the author\nfelt a moral compulsion to put a stop\nthem. Hence the call on Monday in\nwhich a covering story about people\nbeing recognised was cooked up for\nthe easily fooled editor.\nMaybe, there exist an unwritten\nrule 'over the pond' that contact\nwith the 'trains potters in South\nKensington' is akin to leprosy. The\nfact that time and effort had been\nput into communicating with their\nfilthy rag was an unthinkable insult.\nThe poor author was then forced to\nsit alone in the canteen, spat on by\npeople passing him (or her) in the\ncorridor, turned away from his own\nhome and disowned by his (or her)\npage 4, or else none of this will\nmean anything. Apologies for the\nslightly confused manner of the\nfollowing article; this was not easy\nto write.\nIgnorance is bliss, as they say.\nAnd as usual, they are absolutely\nright. How I wish I had never laid\nmy eyes on Dave Cohen's letter,\nwell, at least not until after my\nbirthday (Wed 12th). Most of what\nhe said was more or less close to\nthe truth and his style of response\nwas expected, if only by me.\nHe had the choice whether to\nmock me or not, in the same\nmanner as I mocked him. And he\ndid so, but with the wrong intent.\nMy intention was to try and raise\na laugh from a joke than had circled\nwithin IC Radio for weeks, months\npossibly. He didn't mind then, or\nat least that's the feeling I got. The\nwhole article was itself a joke: the\ndeliberate confusion with literacy\nand literary; the criticism of Dave;\n(I am also a member of IC Radio!).\nBy creating some sort of joke within\na joke so to speak, I hoped to diffuse\nthe 'attack' on Dave, and keep it\nlight-hearted. I had hoped he\nwouldn't take it that personally,\nbeing an old joke as well. No real\noffence was meant. It seems I was\nwrong.\nHis letter doesn't fail, though. It\nwas written for the purpose of being\na cruel description of moi, to get\nrevenge as it were, for something\nthat he viewed as harmful. I cannot\npretend that it doesn't hurt, because\nit does. It hurts a lot. Every\ncriticism, regardless of what it is\nabout, hurts. The difference with\nthis one, is that it is from someone\nwho doesn't seem the vindictive\ntype. But, I have survived worse,\nfar worse. If that's the best he can\ncome up with, a few blatantly\nobvious facts that any cretin could\nspot (excuse pun), then frankly his\nletter isn't worth piss. In fact, I would pay more for a poor quality\npint of piss that an entire novel of\nhis, if he could stretch his writing\ntalents that far.\nThis is now turning out to be a slag off of Dave and I had better\nstop here. I don't want to sink his\nlevel; cruel remarks in order to\ndegrade the subject of the joke; but\nif another reply presents itself, then\nso be it. He is a bloody good blok e and is fabulous at running the radio\nstation. Unlike me, he has what I would call, an 'ideal face', ie an\nacne-free zone and unable to do a convincing Bugs Bunny impression.\nI am surprised that he, or anyone\nelse who matches the above 'ideal\nface' criteria, should get so worked\nup about an insignificant, insincere,\nsuperficial analysis by someone like\nmyself. Count your blessings. Look\nat what cards life has dealt you and\nbe grateful, by comparing them\nwith what life has dealt others.\nAnyway, I now have to look\nforward to facing the entire world,\nwith the knowledge that they will\nhave probably read this, and Dave's letter, and hence view me\ndifferently. Some may continue to\nlaugh at me as always, some will\nsay I deserved it, a few evil bastards\nwill be glad. I only want to laugh,\nand others to laugh with me. I think\nI have learned a few valuable\nlessons concerning this pastime, and\nI hope certain others have to.\nP.J. Dodd PS. Time to quit writing for Felix\npossibly?\nPPS. How am I( a) pretentious (b)a social parasite? Of all the\ndescriptive s that have been used to\nportray me, these two have to be\nwithout a doubt, the most inaccurate\never.\nPPPS. I don't know when your\nbirthday is Dave, but Happy\nFucking Birthday, for whenever it\nis.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "'eat ure14 May 1993 Felix 966\nParis in the spring\nHave students always been revolting? Jonty Beavanlooks back at the riots in Paris twenty five years ago.\nOn the 10th May twenty five years\nago Paris was the scene of a revolution. French students who\nhad been marching and protesting\nfor months, finally allowed their\nanger to boil over. It was called the\nNight of the Barricades. By the\nmorning of 11th May the Latin\nquarter of Paris had become a separate country.\nLead by Cohen Bedit, better\nknown as 'Danny the Red', Jacques\nSauvageot, Alan Krivine and Alain\nGeismar, a social revolution took\nplace behind the barricades. Reform\nwas demanded not just for\neducation but for France and the\nentire world. Students gave lectures\non the ideals and rights of the\npeople, while others threw paving\nstones at the police. Until the end\nof June 1968, when the patience of\nthe French government wore out,\nit looked like another revolution had\ntaken place France.\nAlthough by no means as radical,\nstudents in the United Kingdom\nwere also fighting. On University\nCampuses all over the country\nstudent activists were marching,\nboycotting and demanding. Amid\nthe general upheaval of the sixties,\nstudents were the radical face of\nchange; representation of students\nwas minimal, many University\nVice-Chancellors believed that their\nundergraduates were children, not\nadults, but by the mid-seventies,\nstudents had forced change. They\nhad representation on Governing\nBodies of most Higher Education\nestablishments, a voice on academic\ncommittees and were making\nsignificant changes to their\neducation.\nBut has everything been\nachieved? Has the radical spirit of\nyouth gone forever? Is there no\nmore need to be marching on the\nstreets, or building barricades?\nAlthough some progress has been\nmade, immediate horrors such as\nthe Poll Tax, reductions in benefits,\nstudent loans and cases of meagre\ngrants being supplemented by\nstripping or prostitution, indicate\nthe need to fight the corner for\nstudents is as great as ever.\n\u2022 Mil ISSBBBBBSk\nYet the activity of that great\ncampaigning body the National\nUnion of Students (NUS) has\nrecently shown lack of vital signs.\nThe last ey i den ce of what is known\nas 'Direct Action' was early in\n1992, a march to protest about\nstudent poverty. Interesting to note\nthat the few student from Imperial\nthat went were not allowed to take\nthe Imperial College Union banner\nwith them. Since then, nothing; not\na hint of life. Direct Action, the\nterm NUS gives to high profile\ncampaigning (like sit-in's and\nmarches), appears to be a thing of\nthe past. In addition, the use of ultra\nvire s laws has stopped Government\nmoney being used for political\npurposes. A revolutionary student\nbody that campaigns on national\nissues has vanished with title chance\nof re-emergence.\nSince Lorna Fitzsimmons,\ncurrent and now re-elected NUS\npresident came to power the\nrepresentative emphasis of the NUS\nhas changed. Ian Pigg, National\nSecretary of the NUS, summed it\nup as; 'We have stopped fighting\nfor students and started winning for\nthem'. He himself exhibited this\nchange in calling this phrase a' sound bite': a punchy piece of\nrepeatable rhetoric, designed to help\nthe public understand complex\nissues.\nBut what does he actually mean?\nPigg states, Direct Action is a means to an end, if it does not\nachieve those ends then there is no\npoint in pursuing it. With the\ncurrent climate of Voluntary\nMembership, which could have\nserious effects on the NUS, we\nmust make sure our methods of\naction have their full effect, Pigg\ncontinues. On last year's march for\nstudent poverty twenty thousand\nstudents attended; it was meant to\nbe a national demonstration. There\nare two and half million students in\nthe country, and it cuts little ice with\nthe Education Secretary when we\nsay that we are two percent angry\nabout student poverty.\nPigg points out that the students\nin Paris in 1968, might have had\nidealistic values, but were bogged\ndown with beau c racy. As soon as\nthe barriers went up, they elected\ncommittees for revolution and\nrestructuring. The methods that are\nnow employed by the NUS involve\nlunching with their critics, holding\npress conferences and rail tours of\nthe country. Not the most exciting\nor uplifting event for students, but\npossibly more effective. Marches\nagainst student loans got lit de media\ncoverage, and had even less effect.\nSo has the will to agitate gone\nfrom the student body? Pigg\naccused that question of evidence of\na middle-class upbringing. He\nexplains that most students have no\ntime to be marching or plot ing revolution because they are too busy\nholding down a part time job to\nsurvive University. Maybe students\nare now interested in getting jobs\nand careers after university\nchanging the world is no longer on\nthe agenda, that could of course be\nmiddle class upbringing again.\nDirect Action had a role to play\ntwenty five years ago, and the rights\nto representation that exist now owe\nmuch to it. Outdated now, but it is\nworth remembering the atmosphere\nas recorded in this Monday's Guardian: On this unique social\noccasion ar addled old society was\ntaken on a fantastic liberating\ncurve, freeing it from political\nquackery and cultural fraud.\nPage 8\n\n"
