    "content": "Degrading to women; des tabi lising for men? Pornography is a subject which raises strong feelings in ma\npeople. Whether the readers have fears of their own sexual inadequacy or not, reading and mast ur bat in over the material leaves feelings of disgust in most.\nThe Meat Market\nBy Liz Warren\nUK Circulation of 'soft' pornographic magazines readily\navailable in Newsagents (not comprehensive)\nMayfair 157,197\nPenthouse 110,000 circulation\nIndependently assessed readership 581,000\nForum 50,000 (quarterly) circulation\nIndependently assessed readership 250,000\nPAUL RAYMOND MAGAZINES:\nEscort 365,095\nMen Only 239,160\nClub International 129,798\nModel Directory (quarterly) 90,000\nMen's World 102,000\nRazzle 138,667\nTotal for Paul Raymond Magazines = 1,004,720 monthly\nFiesta 240,000\nKnave 90,000\nTotal for all UK magazines listed = 1,618,583\nThese represent only 10% of the monetary value of the\nmaterial sold in the UK\nPornography is big business in the United Kingdom.\nIt pulls in over \u00a3500 million every year. Consider the\nUK circulation of 'soft' pornographic magazines\nreadily available in newsagents (see box). The\nindependently assessed readership of Penthouse and\nForum shows that each copy is read by five people.\nNewsagents claim that on average people buy two\nmagazines, which gives a total readership of about\nfour million, based on these magazines alone.\nGovernment sources estimate that the male resident\npopulation of the United Kingdom aged between 15\nand 64 in June 1988 was 18,760,200. This means\nthat around one in ten men in the United Kingdom buy\npornographic magazines and one in four men in the\nUnited Kingdom read them. The proportion of people\nat Imperial-you-reading these magazines is\nprobably even higher, given the ratio of men to\nwomen. Remember that these figures do not include\nvideos, hard core magazines or any other media.\nMany of the soft core magazine publishers produce\nmore 'respectable' publications such as Brain Damage\n(published by Galaxy who also produce Fiesta and\nKnave) and the Sunday Sport (owned by the\npublishers of Park Lane and Whitehouse). The owners\nof the Sunday Sport also run the Ann Summers chain\nof sex shops, who hold 'tupperware' style parties to\nsell sex aids to women, something which is viewed\nas quite acceptable by many people. Many of the\nwomen who buy from these parties would find\nWhitehouse in particular offensive.\nLast year, MP Clare Short introduced a private\nmember's bill concerning pornography. When she\nspoke in the House of Commons she received a barrage of highly personal insults from back bench MPs, many of them implying that she was only\nintroducing the bill because she was jealous of the\nwomen in magazines. The bill was destroyed by the\nattitude of these MPs. Why does this subject promote\nsuch strong feelings? Is pornography on the increase?\nIs that in itself a bad thing? And where do you draw\nthe line between pornography and, for instance,\n'glamour' photography or an 'art' film?\nIn order to write this feature from an informed\nviewpoint FELIX purchased (without a great deal of\neffort) five magazines: Penthouse, Fiesta, Whitehouse\nand Rodox, which are essentially aimed at men and\nPlaygirl which is marketed towards women. We also\nmanaged to buy a hard core magazine aimed at gay\nmen called Under Construction from a dubious\nbookshop. These provided the starting point for a discussion amongst a mixed group of Imperial College\nstudents (all names have been changed).\nThe dictionary definition of pornography is 'writings,\npictures, films etc designed to stimulate sexual\nexcitement' (Collins Concise English Dictionary).\nPornography should therefore at least offer this,\nwhatever else it provides. Many of the magazines or\nother forms of pornography viewed by the group were\nconsidered to be not only un erotic, but to be either\namusing or disturbing.\nPenthouse was felt to be the acceptable face of\npornography: the pictures were considered to be\nmostly well-photographed, artistic studies of\nattractive naked or semi-naked women. The rest of\nthe magazine consisted of features of general male\ninterest-sports cars, mountain bikes, nuclear power\nand actresses (clothed). There was some discussion\nas to what the difference was between many of the\npictures in Penthouse and certain advertising shots in\nthe current issue of Cosmopolitan. In the end, the\ngroup decided that there was little between them,\nparticularly those shots which used sexual interest as\na marketing ploy.\nWhitehouse was an example of what 'John' called\n'g yna ecological pornography', with the bias of the\npictures being towards open crotches, held wide and\ntreated with glycerine to simulate sexual arousal. The\nemphasis was purely on women as available lumps\nof meat. 'John' described the centre page spread as\n'practically being a medical diagram-all that's missing is the arrows and the labels!'\nFiesta contained a series of pictures of 'Ample\nAnnie', a grotesquely overweight black woman\n(shown on the middle of the right-hand side of the\nback cover). The aureola e of her breasts were best\ndescribed as 'dinner plates'. This feature produced the\ngeneral reaction of laughter and 'How can anyone find\nthat attractive?' The feature was felt to be 'sick',\n'medically unhealthy' and simply unattractive and\nun erotic, although 'Richard' pointed out that in some\ncultures, such women were viewed as the height of\nsexuality. 'Sid' added that there are fetish magazines\nsoley devoted to obese women. It is interesting to\nnote that Fiesta claims to be aimed at both men and\nwomen.\nThe fourth magazine, Rodox, was bought in a large\nsex shop off Leicester Square as an example of a legally available 'hard core' magazine. The most\nhypocritical aspect of this magazine was the white\ncircles which covered certain parts of the pictures.\nThese white circles are required by British law, which\nforbids the display of penetration.\nThe most disturbing part was the 'stories' which\naccompanied the photos. In Ibiza Trio the text reads:\n'Jenny was on a week's holiday in Ibiza, and one day,\nwhilst she was taking a stroll around the town, she\nwas accosted by a couple of paramilitary types in a jeep. One of them whistled and said, 'Hey baby, d 'you\nneed a lift?!' 'Yeah, sure!' she replied naughtily.' That\nwould be great, my feet are killing me!'...Jenny was\noverjoyed...She'd been dying for some dick and here\nshe was, with a burning phallus in each hand...' This\ndemonstrated both a remarkably fantastic approach\nto sex-'Mark' commented that 'all pornography is\nfantasy'-and also a disturbing implication that all\nwomen, when walking down the street minding their\nown business are in fact simply waiting for a man to\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "leap on them and drag them away for sex.\nPerhaps Playgirl, the fifth magazine, is designed for\nthis sort of woman (if she exists). Everyone looking\nat Playgirl was surprised at how far it went. There\nwere the expected shots of muscular men displaying\ntheir biceps. In the issue we saw there was a large\nfeature on several members of the Chicago Bears\nAmerican Football team.There were a number of shots\nof simulated sex; something which no-one had\nexpected. In general, these shots were felt to be\nconsiderably more tasteful and erotic than any of the\nequivalent pictures in Rodox. None of the women\nfound the pictures of men particularly attractive.\n'Susan' said she felt that women had more\naesthetically pleasing bodies than men.'I prefer\nlooking at women to looking at naked men', she said.\nOne aspect of the magazines that was felt to be\nparticularly disturbing was the advertisements for\nitems such as penis enlargers: 'Scientifically (sic)\ndeveloped over many years, this vacuum developer\nwill help, with regular use, to develop a larger\nthrusting, throbbing, growing erection that you can\nshow to anyone with pride'. This sort of\nadvertisement, together with letters including phrases\nsuch as 'this was the longest yet, 10\" and very thick',\nwere described by 'John' as 'overall, playing on some\nmens' feelings of inadequacy'. A quick straw poll\nreached the conclusion that the average length of a man's penis was about six inches. 'Susan' pointed out\nthat as the average length of the vagina was about\nfive inches, a ten inch penis would be no more\npleasurable than a six inch penis and quite likely to\nbe a lot more painful. In general the magazines were\nfelt to show a false and possibly dangerous view of\nwhat was sexually possible and 'normal' or 'average'.\nComputer pornography is a relatively new\ndevelopment. It is certainly available on computers\nwithin Imperial College (the pictures shown in this\nfeature were produced by an Apple Macintosh in\nCollege) and falls into several types. There are\ninteractive programmes such as MacPlaymate where\n'tools' can be used to stimulate an illustration of a female figure to 'orgasm'; she can be dressed in\n-\" mmm mmm Under Construction: For all you men who like seeing women humiliated. How would you like to be on\nthe receiving end?\ndifferent costumes and will also masturbate and\n'couple with her talented sex partners'. It is also\npossible to obtain digitised images from pornographic\nfilms, for example Maxine Headboom, contains about\ntwo minutes of fellatio. The image looks like a grainy\nblack and white television picture. Another type\nconsists of games of a sexual nature, such as strip\npoker, which divests images of women of their\nclothes. A Time Out feature recently described these\nas 'catering very much for the rather na ff tastes of\n15 year old boys'. Many of these programmes are\nWhitehouse: In your newsagent now. Why not pick it up\nare all owned by\nwith your copy of Brain Damage and Sunday Sport? They\nthe same company.\nfreely available on bulletin boards-openly accessible\nto anyone with E mail and far more discreet to acquire\nthan a magazine. Computer pornography brings a whole new meaning to the word 'shareware'.\nWhat about the telephone lines like 'Deep Throated\nJoy', 'I teased her till she came' and 'Bad girl says\nplease', all titles obtained from one genuine\nadvertisement? These are often, but not always, a lot\nmilder than the titles promise and some include a great\ndeal of advertising for other numbers before\nembarking on the theme of the phone call. Perhaps\nit is as well they are so mild since they are easily\navailable to any under-18 year-old with a telephone.\nEven some of the 'chat lines' operated by respectable\nbodies like British Telecom have been closed down\nbecause they have turned into explicit sessions\nbetween callers who 'talk dirty' and arrange\nassignations over the phone, although this isn't necessarily pornography.\nPerhaps one of the most bizarre new developments\nin the world of pornography is the arrival of\npornographic holograms. A British company has just\nreleased a range of six 'erotic' holograms. The images\nwere produced by British artist James Copp and show\nscenes based on Victorian erotic photography, with\nmen and women in various states of undress. Copp\nsays that he produced the work whilst comparing the\neffect of holography on images that were prevalent\nin early photographic work, and admits that the series\nwas released purely to make money. He also says that\nhe thinks people 'will not find the images erotic in the\nfirst instance because they're so unconventional in\n3D'. Holographers have been predicting pornographic\nholograms since the infancy of the science: with the\npossibility of animation and multiple images as well\nas 3D effect, they are wondering what will appear\nnext.\nVideo pornography contains much the same themes\nas the harder magazines. Under the Video Recordings\nAct of 1984 it is illegal to depict sex with violence\nor show genitals and urination/excretion. The\nCommittee against Pornography and Censorship, a pressure group set up to express concern about the\nproliferation of pornography and the messages it\ndisplays about women, carried out research in Soho\nto obtain illegal videos. Despite the 1984 Act, they\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "FeliX Pornography\nThis has been an odd week. I have never worked on\nan issue during which so much discussion ensued on\none subject. Pornography is a taboo area, often\nsniggered about by 15 year old school boys but rarely\nmentioned publicly. It raises strong feelings in women\nespecially, since they are so often the losers in this\ndegrading pastime. During this week I became more\nand more aware of what I really wanted to do with\nthis feature. The idea started out as a take-off of this\nmonth's Cosmopolitan and ended, I hope, as a serious\narticle on something which affects us all, whether we\nuse it or not.\nI came to the conclusion that, at all costs, I must\navoid anything which would become pornography\nitself. I wanted something which would offend the\npeople who buy pornography. I felt that an image of\ntwo men was the only source for this purpose; the\nmajority of the market is aimed at heterosexual men,\nafter all. I hope I have succeeded in not only raising\npeople's awareness but in disgusting the very people\nwho continue to fund this multi-million pound\nindustry.\nMy own views on the subject, did change as I realised how syn on omo us the industry was with the\nworld of drugs. If you buy a copy of Sunday Sport or\nBrain Damage, you are helping to fund and continue\none of the more perverse areas of our society. If you\norganise an Ann Summers party for women, you are\nsupporting their abuse in magazines such as\nWhitehouse. This is frightening. What is more\nworrying is the way in which you can rapidly gain\ncontacts in the illegal 'hard-core' areas through\nadvertisements in 'soft' magazines.\nI believe that Clare Short, MP is now organising a petition against pornography. Maybe the heightened\nmedia attention which the issue is now receiving will\npromote her cause; I hope it will. It would be nice to\nsee exactly who flings insults this time if the matter\nis discussed during a televised period of the House of\nCommons, but I doubt this will happen. If the problem\nis as prevalent as our feature would indicate, the\ntelevision companies involved must be riddled with\nopponents to Ms Short's point.\nI am sure that this issue will have upset some\nwomen. I am very sorry if it has upset anybody other\nthan momentarily, apart from the people who it was\nmeant to offend. Think about what you are doing, is\nthe only comment I can pass to these people.

    "content": "Earthquake alert\nWhen, on the 17th October, Northern California was\nhit by its worst earthquake in decades, the Civil\nEngineering Department's Earthquake Field Training\nUnit (EFTU) responded in record time. The EFTU is part\nof the Engineering Seismology and Earthquake\nEngineering (ESEE) Section and was set up to provide\ntraining for engineers and earth scientists working on\nreducing earthquake damage. As soon as news of the\nearthquake began to arrive, in the early hours of a Wednesday morning, preparations began to dispatch\nan EFTU team to the affected area. On Saturday 21st the team consisting of Dr Amr Elnashai, Ahmed El\nGhazouli and Julian Bommer, flew into San Francisco.\nThe team members spent four man-weeks in\nCalifornia, working in close co-operation with\nAmerican engineers and earth scientists, investigating\ndamage to buildings and communications as well as\nfaulting, landslides and ground behaviour.\nThe first shock came at about 5pm local time in the\nmidst of the long-awaited World Series Baseball\nmatch between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland\nAthletics. It was centred on the San Andreas fault\nwhich ruptured over a length of some 40km in the\nSanta Cruz mountains, some 70km to the south of\nSan Franciso. The magnitude of the earthquake is not\nyet accurately known, but it is believed to be\nsomewhere around 7 on the Richter Scale. The scale\nis logarithmic, making this some 40 times smaller than\nthe '8.3' earthquake of 1906 which destroyed large\nareas of San Francisco.\nThe earthquake of October 1989, which has been\nnamed the Loma Prieta earthquake after the highest\nmountain in the Santa Cruz range, killed only 63\npeople. Had the earthquake occurred closer to San\nFrancisco (where the San Andreas, Hayward and\nCalaveras faults run) the damage would have been\ngreater and the death toll far higher. It is likely that\nthe area will suffer nearer and bigger shocks in the\nfuture. The Loma Prieta earthquake is a reminder that,\nalthough California has made great progress in\nearthquake engineering, the problem has not\ndisappeared.\nOf the 63 who died, the majority perished when an\nupper section of the double-decker Nimitz Freeway\ncollapsed onto the lower deck, squashing vehicles\ndown to 18 inches. This freeway is normally packed\nwith traffic moving at a crawl at such a time and first\nestimates put the death toll as high as 200. Luckily,\nbecause of the number of people avidly watching the\nbaseball match, it was mercifully un congested. The ESEE Section is now working with the original\ndrawings of the bridge and acc el ero grams recorded\nin this earthquake, to find out what went wrong.\nThere would seem to be certain fundamental errors\nin the design of the columns which made the structure\nexceptionally vulnerable. This is despite a programme\nof bridge an highway strengthening started after a number of bridges and elevated freeways collapsed\nin the San Fernando earthquake which hit Southern\nCalifornia in 1971.\nThe famous bridge crossing San Francisco Bay lost\none section and there was extensive damage to the\nfreeways. One bridge collapsed, its columns punching\nthrough the deck.\nAlthough the death toll was low, the economic loss\nwas very high, estimated at up to $10 billion. More\nmoney will be lost as collapsed bridges, damaged\nfreeways and landslide-blocked roads disrupt the\ntransport system. The railway network in the area is\nextremely limited and although the earthquake\nencouraged people to make more use of the excellent\nmetro system in San Francisco, California is an area\nwhere nearly everyone travels by car.\nThe exclusive Marina District of San Francisco was\nexceptionally badly hit. Here the houses were built on\nlandfill, put down in the 1920's to reclaim valuable\nland in the Bay area. This soft and un consolidated fill\nliquefied during the earthquake, temporarily becoming\n'quick sand', cracking and buckling the pavements\nand causing extensive damage to houses. Elsewhere,\nliquefaction of natural deposits caused extensive\ndamage to river bank, threatening settlements and\nagricultural land with flooding when the heavy rains\nbegin. These rains are also expected to bring an\nadditional hazard to those coastal and mountain areas\naffected by landslides. There are also about 100 dams\nin the area which, despite the fact that their reservoirs\nwere almost empty after two years of drought and a long summer, survived well. Following some\nspectacular damage to earth dams in the 1971\nearthquake, the State's dams also underwent an\nextensive strengthening programme.\nIn the Santa Cruz mountains there was extensive\nground cracking, some fissures being over a metre\nwide and about a metre deep. Many of these were\nbeing filled in or covered over by the state and county\nauthorities where they crossed roads and by home\nowners where they crossed private land.\nThe EFTU is now producing a preliminary report on\ntheir field observations and carrying out further\nanalyses of the collected data. A presentation of the\npreliminary findings will be made on Wednesday\n29th November at 1.45pm in Room 201, Civil\nEngineering. All members of College are welcome.\nJulian Bommer\n\u2022 The US Government ban on funding research\ninvolving aborted human foetuses is to continue\nindefinitely after a decision by Louis Sullivan, the US\nSecretary for Health and Human Services. The ban\nwas first imposed last year following experiments in\nwhich foetal tissue was grafted into the brains of\nsufferers from Parkinson's disease.\nInitially, the American National Institute of Health\n(NIH) had decided that within certain bounds, such\nresearch was acceptable, a decision that was much\ncriticised by the anti-abortion lobby.\nSullivan has come down on the side of the anti-abortionists. He now argues that the thought that the\nfoetus could be useful for research could persuade\nwomen unsure of whether or not to have an abortion,\nto do so: politicians do not like high abortion rates.\nThe decision has been opposed by the NIH and AIDS\nresearchers who believe that foetal liver cells can be\nused to control the virus.\n\u2022 The future looks bleak for NASA's Freedom Space\nStation. Robert Ree of the Congress Science, Space\nand Technology Committee is furious at the agency's plans to scale down the project. Under the new plans,\nthe scheme will lose 20% of its 1990 budget and the\nfinal construction will be extended by a year and a half. Ree has proposed scrapping the scheme entirely\nrather than letting it fade away.\n\u2022 Only 30% of carbon-dioxide gas is absorbed by the\noceans, according to figures from a Natural\nenvironment Research Council sponsored study. It has\npreviously been thought that the figure was closer to\n50%. Carbon-dioxide is, of course, a 'greenhouse gas'\nand, if the figures are correct, the planet could be\nwarming even quicker than was once thought.\nIt has also been revealed that the ozone hole over\nAntarctica, which is already larger than many\nresearchers had expected, is starting to break up\nahead of time. Several ozone-hole theories, including\none linking the size of the hole to the direction of the\nwinds in the middle atmosphere, have already fallen\nfoul of the hole's erratic behaviour.\n\u2022 In an interim report from the cold fusion advisory\npanel of the US Department of Energy (DoE), Moshe\nGai of Yale University and Stephen Jones of Brigham\nYoung University have announced that there is no\nevidence for cold-fusion in the form of anomalous\nneutron emission from titanium immersed in deuteron\ngas. Jones, who believes that cold fusion may be an\neffect of small-scale solids and Gai, who does not,\nagreed to collaborate in a joint, decisive experiment\nand the only stray neutrons detected were traced back\nto cosmic rays.\nHowever, the lack of results has not discouraged\nJones. Some of his other work suggests that the joint\nexperiment was run for too short a time giving it only\na5050 chance of success.\n\u2022 Plugs. There will be a talk on 'Ground Based X Ray\nAstronomy' at 1pm on 21st November in Physics LT2.\nAt 5.30pm on the same day, Life Scientists can, for\nthe price of \u00a32, partake of Cheese and Wine in the\nBiology Seminar Room. On the 22nd, at 1.15pm in\nPhysics LT1, there will be a seminar asking 'What's wrong with time travel?'. If successful, the seminar\nwill be repeated three months ago.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Astoria, November 7th The Return of Marillion\nGone are Fish, the usual backdrops, Mark Kelly's banks of keyboards and Steve Rothery's beard. In\ntheir place we have Steve Hogarth [ex-Europeans], the\n'man with the big white gloves'. As the first notes of\nKing of Sunset Town roll from the speakers, he is\ngreeted as a well known hero, despite the fact that\nthis is his first British gig with Marillion. The man has\na hard job on his hands, replacing Fish, possibly one\nof the best frontmen in the business, but he doesn't try to compete, singing the old Marillion songs in a similar style to that of Fish, but receding into the\nbackground during instrumental breaks. The new\nsongs are sung with the same force as on the album\nSeason's End, and as usual, Marillion are faultless\nmusicians.\nOK, a different voice on Kayleigh sounds strange,\nbut the man in black is a very capable frontman and\ndefinitely here to stay (if he doesn't fall from one of\nthe speaker stacks which he climbs during the\nperformance). All in all, a very enjoyable gig.\nTown & Country Club\nThe Return of Fish\nFish kicks off the last night of his tour with Alex\nHarvey's Faith Healer, touching hands with the crowd,\nand the scene is set for a two hour long sweat as the\ncrowd push and shove to be nearer the stage. Here,\nFish airs most of the new album, Vigil in the\nWilderness of Mirrors, due out in January, as well as\n8 Marillion-era tracks, including the ever popular Script\nfor a Jester's Tear. The crowd go ecstatic at any of\nThe Marquee, November 12th. Bad Brains\nthese songs, and even the unfamiliar new material\nreceives tumultuous applause. From what was heard\ntonight, Vigil should be an album to watch out for,\neach song sounding very different from the last, and\na complete change of direction from Marillion,\nsounding more folk y, with more guitar (Fish uses two\nguitars).\nThe stage set was good with an impressive\nQueueing started at 3pm, so by the time we got in,\nBroken Bones had left. Judging by the previous vinyl\noffering, F.O. A.D., just as well.\nFew bands manage to combine hard rock and\n'ethnic' music (for want of a better word), among\nthem Living Colour, Fishbone and the likes of RunDMC and the Beastie Boys. Bad Brains are\nacknowledged pioneers, the two most recent LPs, /\nAgainst I and Quickness, combining dub with\nspeed core and the philosophy of Rastafari with the\npower of metal.\nGiven the numbers of dedicated Broken Bones fans,\nit was gratifying to see the friendliness of the\naudience, with thrashers swaying to roots reggae, and\ndreadlocks flying when the speed increased. Mind\nIan McCulloch\nyou, with so many people worshipping Jah in the\ntraditional way, no wonder the audience was mellow.\nA track list would be inappropriate since the band\ndecided the next number when the previous one had\nfinished, were strongly influenced by requests from\nthe audience and were so loud, distorted and obscured\nby the throng as to make tracks all but unidentifiable\n(to me at least). A number of gems stood out\nhowever, a dub Day Tripper, for example.\nAn excellent gig, with an innovative band enjoying\nthemselves, all of the rock clich es( stage diving off\nthe balcony, heavy handed security and permanent\naural damage), and some refreshing touches Inobody\nhurt in the mosh).\nJ. C.G. Faith and Healing\nLet's face it. Echo and the Bunnymen could have been\ncontenders. They had that big sound without all the\npretentious flag waving that has befallen the likes of\nU2 and Simple Minds. And so it was with some\nsurprise that I found this single (taken from Ian\nMcCulloch's debut solo album-Candleland)\nbeginning with a drum machine. Perhaps it was a conscious decision to try and move away from the\nPage 6\nBunnymen sound, perhaps it was because no one\ncould replace the unique style of the late Pete De\nFreitas. Whatever his reasons Mac has ended up with\na single that vocally is an extension of Over You (a track from The Game, the Bunnymen's last album\nwhich Mac admits is his least favourite) over a cold\nslab of New Order rhythms. All in all, an uneasy\nalliance.\nlandscape backdrop, and the lighting well done,\nconsidering the size of the lighting rig which used all\nthe available space. Fish himself goes from strength\nto strength as a live performer, and all these combine\nto make this 'one of the best' gigs of the year. It will\nseem a long wait until March, when he should be\ntouring again.\nDave Poubon\nWANTED\nMUSIC\nHave you seen a concert\nor bought an album\nrecently?\nWhy not tell everybody\nwhat you thought of it?\nWe will print reviews of\nany type of music from\nrock to classical.\nSend reviews to:\nNEIL LAVITT\nMusic Editor, FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Heathers Lysistrata\nVeronica Sawyer has a problem. She doesn't like her\nfriends at the local high school. But then her friends\naren't very nice, being the sort of people who enjoy\nhumiliating anyone who isn't as rich and pretty as they\nare.\nVeronica becomes attracted to JD, the new kid in\nschool who wears a student overcoat and pretends\nto be Mickey Rourke out of Barfly. He suggests that\nthey do something about Veronica's problem, and she\nis only too happy to agree. Little does she know where\nthis decision will lead...\nThe director, Michael Lehmann, takes side swipes\nat a wide range of American stereotypes: rich bitches,\nsports jocks, dorks, fatties, suburban living, hippies,\nvicars, cops and college students all come in for the\ntreatment and most of it works. The film has a surface\nveneer of normality which is lifted occasionally to\nreveal a more surreal world lurking below. The croquet\nmatches, in particular, are pure Alice in Wonderland.\nOn balance, though, I found it hard to like this film.\nThe characters are uniformly unpleasant to everyone\naround them, and lack the redeeming ability of holding\nthe viewer's interest for more than a few minutes.\nPerhaps you'd have to have been to an American high\nschool to appreciate it properly.\nJim Lucy.\nThe Bogie Man\nHogmanay. The staff of a mental institution on the\noutskirts of Glasgow are celebrating New Year in the\ntraditional Scottish fashion-getting very drunk and\nattempting to get off with one another. Meanwhile,\none of the inmates decides that he isn't going to spend\n1990 locked up...\nThe Bogie Man is a new comic published by Fat Man\nPress, a new, Scottish-based comics firm. It is written\nby John Wegner and Alan Grant, a well known twosome in the comics world, having written for Judge\nDredd and Batman.\nThe artwork is by Robin Smith, a Marvel artist, who\nhas done a fine job of conjuring up the bleak darkness\nof Glasgow, as well as capturing the likeness of\nBogart.\nBogart? The escapee mentioned early not only looks\nlike Bogart-he thinks he's Bogart. He prowls through\nGlasgow, on a delusion ary quest for the Fat Man;\nweaving every innocent he encounters into the sinister\nweb he believes surrounds him. Then, when he\nacquires a gun, things start to get serious.\nThe writers do a convincing job of recreating the\nnigh-on unintelligible Glaswegian tongue, and a helpfully provided 'McGlossary' will aid the\nSassenachs, despite being slightly inaccurate-a 'piece' is not just a sandwich, but any old snack.\nBogie's talk is also nicely done, and the two are\noften cleverly contrasted.\nThe tie-in with Glasgow's appointment as European\nCity of Culture 1990 (don't laugh) is also very apt.\nOn the whole, the comic is very adult, and is well\nworth a look, even if you've always believed that\ncomics were all about guys who wear underpants over\ntheir tights-this will prove you wrong.\nAdam T. Aristophanes, a comic play right of Athens in the fifth\ncentury BC has always been particularly successful\nwhen translated into English because it is good, old\nfashioned, unsophisticated, 'whoops-there-go-my-trousers' b aw de ry which is at the root of much of\nEnglish humour. He was also a sharp satirist, although\nmost of this has naturally lost its edge in the\nintervening 2,400 years.\nThe play was originally an anti-war satire and the\ntheatre group Cracked Mirror have attempted to\ntranslate this into a twentieth century play, complete\nwith feminist overtones. The hybrid that results is not\ntotally successful. Most of the language used is\neveryday English, though the script tends to slip into\nrhymes which are a bit pretentious and pseudo-Shakespearian phrases are mixed with the colloquial,\nwhich is bloody awful.\nThe theatre-situated behind a pub-is very small\nand it reflects well on the group that this never cramps\ntheir style. The production is, at times, hilarious and\nrather obscene-the women of Athens, led by\nLysistrata, withhold their conjugal favours from their\nhusbands hoping this will convince them to make\npeace with Sparta during a particularly nasty war. The\nsexual frustrations that result are manifested by the\nuse of long sponge sausages stuffed inside the men's kilts, which are used~a great deal-beaten, slapped\nand squeezed by the women.\nThere are only four men who play all the parts,\nand start by being suitably neanderthal and bashing\neach other's brains out.All their parts are\ncaricatures.The women are played by five ladies, led\nby Lysistrata who maintains an agreeably enigmatic\nand chaste figure throughout.\nThe play is extremely funny, but has no depth. The\nmoral: women are sensible and stubborn; men are\nstupid, violent and arrogant. This is hardly an original\nor particularly accurate generalisation, however the\nplay of Aristophanes gives little leeway to change this.\nLysistrata is being performed at the DOC theatre\nclub, 64 Lawford Road, Kentish Town. The nearest\ntube is Kentish Town (90p). The tickets cost \u00a33.50\nand the play will run until December 2.\nAdam Harrington\nThe Rainbow\nThe latest offering from director Ken Russell, adapted\nfrom the D.H. Lawrence novel of the same name,\ncentres on the experiences, sexual and otherwise, of\nan (at first) innocent girl (Sammi Davis) as she grows\nup and leaves home.\nBeing a Ken Russell film, there is, as expected,\nweirdness, nudity and bon king. As it is only rated 15\nnone are present in excessive amounts, although there\nis something for everyone. (Say no more-if you're\ninterested you'll have to go to see the film.)\nOn the whole, the film is beautifully put together\nwith excellent use made of the various location shots.\nThre are some definitely above-average performances\nfrom Paul McGann as a young soldier and the girl's lover, and the beautiful Amanda Donohoe as Ursula's teacher and second lover (?!).\nThe Rainbow could be classed as an 'arty' film \u2014\nbut don't let that put you off seeing it. It is well worth\na look, even if only for the gratuitous, but tasteful love\n(lust?) scenes. Be warned this film is certainly not\nanother 9'A Weeks/Two Moon Junction. (No matter\nwhat the ad posters look like.)\nDAN.\nPage 5\n\n"

J Lube iM Helping.\nHands 7\nMac Playmate\" MacPlaymaie. A computer program fort it il ation or amusement? The graphics have areas programmed for arms, legs, torso\nand head, which mow independently in a very unnatural manner. Other examples of computer pornography include 'Maxi\nHeadboom' and 'Squirt', in which a woman is shown reclining, with fluid squirting from her breast occasionally.\nfound videos contained scenes in which 'women were\n'fist-fucked', bugger ed, used as animals, enjoyed\nhumiliation, urinated in each other's mouths and were\nshown shaven, with labia rings and chains (pierced\nlabia with rings inserted and chained together)'. They\nclaim that R and 18 rated films show the same\nmessages with some of the more explicit scenes\nedited out. Pornographic videos can now be obtained\nin petrol stations as well as video shops and many\nlarge chains of hotels have 'adult' channels available\nas part of room service, without the need for a licence.\nWhere is the dividing line between a 'porn' film such\nas Erotic Eva (advertised in Fiesta) in which we are\npromised 'Eva, a snake dancer-beautiful, erotic and\nloves all warm long slithery things. Explicit and candid\nphotography shows some amazing sexual tricks';\nScandal in which an orgy is shown where the butler\nwears a sign saying 'beat me if I fail to please' and\nan 'Art' film such as The Cook, the Thief, his Wife\nand her Lover where Helen Mirren and Alan Howard\nmake love in various bizarre situations such as a lavatory and a restaurant pantry without even having\nexchanged names? The only answer can be in terms\nof the 'message' of the films. The plot of Erotic Eva\npresumably revolves around sex. Scandal aims to\ntitillate but has a plot line which is not solely\nconcerned with displaying sex but which purports to\nmake a statement about the way in which society\nviewed Christine Keiller and her male friends. The\nCook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover used sex to\nexplore the liberation of the Wife from domination by\nthe Thief, showed her emerging as a strong and\ndominant figure in control of her own destiny. But\ndoes this existence of a storyline still qualify such a use of sex? Films such as this are frequently 'sold' on\nthe basis of their sexual content. A stance no better\nthan that of 'Erotic Eva,' in some eyes.\nThis brings us to the fundamental question of: what\nis pornography? The dictionary definition is clearly\nincomplete. Many of the people looking at the material\ndescribed here were not sexually stimulated, but\ndefinitely considered it pornographic. Many of the\nthemes that were commented upon again and again\nconcerned the images of the women portrayed. 'John'\nsaid 'they lead men into thinking '\nI can dominate\nwomen and I can have them because they are\nsubmissive'. 'Richard' said 'magazines like\nWhitehouse and Rodox ate showing women to be\nobjects for sex with no redeeming features and that\nis possibly dangerous.'\nThere are no strong links between pornography and\ncrimes of violence against women such as rape, but\npornography has been shown to make 'ordinary' men\nsee themselves as more likely to commit rape, less\nlikely to respond sympathetically to rape victims and\nmore likely to be lenient to rapists. [Pornography and\nSexual Violence: Evidence of the Links, published by\nEverywoman.) 'Richard' said 'magazines, particularly\nthose which involve men dominating women, will\nquite likely nurture in a dangerous way the existing\npsychoses of people who buy them'.\nThe stronger magazines showed the general themes\nof women thrusting their crotches to the camera,\nbegging for sex, domination and violence. They\nshowed them wanting to be used and abused sexually\nas they go about their daily business. The material we\nhad was mostly at the 'soft' end of the market, but\nnevertheless disturbed some of the people who looked\nat it, in particular the subliminal messages in the\nmagazines. Some areas were felt to be amusing or\nfaintly ridiculous. In the final analysis, erotic pictures\nand writing are not in themselves damaging, and may\nbe aesthetically pleasing. They may help both\nindividuals and couples in their sex lives, but such\nmaterial ought to be sensitive, thoughtful and give\nequal status to all its participants and readers. With\nthe exception of some parts of Playgirl, none of the\nmaterial discussed had these qualities.\nYes, pornography may stop a potential rapist going\nout and raping someone. But that is only because it\nhas replaced rape with porn: rape and other sexual\ncrimes are not about sex but about power.\nPornography is also not about sex but about power.\nA new definition of pornography should be\nestablished: pornographic material is anything which\nportrays human beings taking part in humiliating,\nfantastic al or degrading activities, whether sexual or\nnot.\nThere is a law against distributing literature which\n'incites racial hatred'. It is called the Race Relations\nAct of 1976. Material showing coloured or Jewish\npeople being beaten, humiliated or sexually degraded\nwould cause an uproar if sold. Why is there no law\nto protect fifty per cent of the population from the\nsame thing?\nA word of\nwarning\nThe humorous side of the soft porn trade displays\nan easy path to the hard core extremes. The\nSunday Sport displays advertisements for\ntelephone numbers as well as sex shops. Buying\na 'soft' magazine such as Whitehouse from one\nof these stores, including Ann Summers opens up\na world of hard core degradation to the eager\ncustomer. Under Construction was purchased\nfrom a shop advertised in Whitehouse. The\nbookshop was housed in a bare room with\nportable shelves, easily transportable in the case\nof a police raid. Extreme hard-core pornography\nis just like any other illegal trade it seems: there\nis an easy way in for anybody who wants to join,\nand it may be sitting on your breakfast table this\nSunday.\nB^ liER BETTER r f\"\"EC TIO IM!

    "content": "Maybe we should all have thought of something more general than science to study. Do we all see our\nas middle management trainees?\nDisillusionment\nName withheld at Editor's discretion\nI remember when I was about six years old I actually\nasked my mother if I could have extra lessons in Maths\nand English with Miss Thompson because I was keen\nto learn. And now? Well, last year I would have run\nten miles, literally, rather than sit in front of a problem\nsheet. Is it me? Or (and this is the way I like to think)\nis it not? My learning ability cannot have regressed\nso far since I was six, I think, so perhaps it was\neducation that killed the will to learn. Similarly a friend\nwho, like me, used to be top of the year until he got\nto 14 or 15, has since dropped out of two degree\ncourses. Another has changed from being the top of\nthe class at '0' level to dropping out of the first year\nof an engineering degree. It would be easy to write\noff these failures as the pressure of University life,\nliving alone, etcetera, but in my experience it was in\nthe sixth form, or earlier, that the disillusionment\noccur r red.I think it was a gradual realisation of irrelevance that\ncrept up on me as an adolescent. Why should I have\nto learn how fast light prop o gates in a vacuum, or by\nwhat angle it bends when it gets to a block of glass\nor water? It is there and I can see with it, what more\ndo I need to know? Enough to know that the stars are\nastronomically far away and sparkle on a clear night,\nwhy do I need to be able to calculate the mass of the\nmoon or its gravitational pull?\nI was taught the biological version of sex, the\nuseless bit that doesn't really matter. I could draw a vagina in cross-section, but didn't have a clue about\na front elevation...and not a word about the pill or\nthose aerials that women insert to pick up Radio\nThree. And Mathematics? That was the most\nirrelevant of all. It didn't even pretend to have any\napplication to real life, but was just an intellectual\ngame for people who didn't care if they wore the same\nanorak every day, or what people thought of flared\ntrousers nowadays.\nBut our English teacher, no, he knew what life was\nabout. He didn't vote Conservative, he wore lightly\ntoned pastel day-suits, drank in the same pubs as the\nsixth form and dated the most attractive pupil in the\nschool. No wonder most of the sexually repressed\nfifth form at that public school flocked to the arts\ncourses at the age of sixteen when fh af decision\narrived. Thar decision to go arts or not that's dropped\nin your lap sometime before 'A' levels, heralded only\nby a single career interview with a retired English\nteacher, or with a lady from the council who advises\nyou to become an engineer 'because we haven't got\nenough'.\nAnd me? Perhaps I should have flocked with them.\nBut here I sit, on the wrong end of a decision made\nsix years ago. If I 'got into the wrong box' it is\nnobody's fault but my own. But I do feel somebody\nis to blame in that the decision which box to get into\n(if you'll forgive the double en trend re) is made so early\nwhen only a handful of kids know what they really\nwant to do. I also blame that person for the very\nexistence of the boxes themselves. Why must one\nchoose to go for either 'The Sciences' or 'The Arts'\nor some eco/pol civil service option at LSE?\nSo my advice to you planners-of-courses, lamenting\nthe continuing drop in applicants for science and\nengineering course, is to come up with something\nmore general, something that will keep options open\nand make applicants feel, when they are weighing up\ncoming to the best technological institute in Britain\nagainst its lack of human-interest value, that there is\nmore here than an expensive ticket to\nmiddle-management.\nCity & Guilds Union presents\nGUILDS\nCARNIVAL\nwith\nTHE MAN FROM DEL MONTE\nand\n\u2022Howlin' Wilf & the Vee Jaysplus Films, Cocktails, Videos,\nBar till 2am, Disco till 3am FRIDAY 17th NOV\nIC Union Building\n8.00pm Tickets: \u00a34 (adv), \u00a34.50 (on the door)\nfrom Guilds Office\nITALIAN SOCIETY\nTHE ROMAN\nTOGA PARTY\nThursday 23rd November\n8.00pm to 1.00am UNION LOUNGE\nBar it Disco * Roman Food\nDRESS CODE: TOGA\nPrice: \u00a31.50 (50p off if you wear a toga)!\n50p to members\nDON'T BE THE ONLY NERD WITHOUT A TOGA!\nft\n\n"

    "content": "Football\nLondon Hospitals-5 IC Dribblers!-0\nBattling violently against the elements (namely the\nbastard in the Black!), IC ladies fielded a brave 11\nlasses to face the onslaught of bad decisions, bad\ninsight and bad timekeeping, not to mention London\nHospital, whilst still suffering from Saturday evening\nand an excess of available parties. The back four were\nstalwart and solid in the face of the furious attack by\na7 foot square Vikingess and Maradonna herself (I'm sure that was hand ball in the box!). It would take too\nlong to describe all their goals but I would like to say\nthat Emma was superb in goal and we don't blame\nher for the second goal. It was more down to the Eddy\ncurrents and force fields created by the blast of the\ndirect free kick which forced her hands an inch apart\neither side of the ball! For the rest of the match there\nwere a couple of near misses and a lot of kicked shins.\nAll things considered the 'Dribblers' achieved their\ngoal (if you'll pardon the pun); ie not to be beaten 6-0\nas we were last time we played 'doctors and nurses'\nwith London Hospital (ph nar r,p hn arr). Honestly, have\nthey anything else to do but practice foot ie now the\nambulance men are on strike??\nUC ll-(1) 1 IC 11-11) 3\nIC II move comfortably into the next round of the cup\nwith a fine victory at UCL.\nUCL started sprite ly enough and capitalised on their\nearly pressure with a well taken goal. However, after\nthis point they never smelt the IC goal and -when\nreduced to ten men by an injury, were constantly\nunder IC pressure.\nThey conceded the equalise r in the first half when\na slightly deflected E Coates' free-kick beat the keeper\nand went into the top corner of the net. The two\nsecond half goals came from good 'edge of box'\nstrikes; first from R Martinez and then from R Kay,\nwho hit a right foot rocket late in the game.\nRugby\nIC 2nd XV- RHBNCDespite a stiff breeze against them in the first half,\nthe 2nd XV resisted some heavy pressure, and\nconceded only two penalties going into half time 6-0\ndown.\nHaving been evenly matched in the first half, the\nIC pack began to take control of the ruc ks and mauls,\nreleasing the back division who could have scored\nmore had the handling been sharper. IC fought back\nusing the wind, and eventually got a penalty which\nTintin converted. As the time went on, anxiety crept\ninto the IC attack, but a well worked move set Tintin\nfree to finish well and put IC in the lead for the first\ntime. The try was converted (Tintin) and a late penalty\ngave Tintin an opportunity to seal victory, which he\ndid with ease.\nThis was the best team effort his season, and a great morale boost for future games. Also our thanks\nto Henry who did a great job at scrum half, despite\nhaving his nose broken by over zealous tackling (or\nwas he punched in the face?).\n16 Page\nHockey\nRHBNC 3rds(0)0 IC 3rds(4)4 RHBNC\u20141 IC\u20141\nWith the echoes of eleven goals against Surrey still\nringing in their ears, Imperial travelled to Royal\nHolloway with high hopes. Neither strong winds or,\nwhat appeared to be an organisational nightmare,\ndeterred Imperial from dominating a shakey Holloway\nside that lacked both imagination and lustre. Two fine\ngoals from Adam Pritchard, an opportunist strike fr on Jon Briggs and another 'sneaker' from Ian Macgovern\nleft Imperial comfortably ahead at half-time.\nThe second half, however, found Imperial\nfloundering on a pitch which now closely resembled\na swamp. Kevin Hill, finding the conditions favourable,\nconstantly threatened a stationary defence, but,\ndespite fine performances by the IC team and the\noccasional foray upfield from Eric Sie, Imperial failed\nto convert their superiority on a fixture that had long\nbeen decided.\nHolloway had all the play in a tight match but IC\nproved that good tackling and an awful pitch cold stop\nmuch of the play.\nThe opposition's inability to score short corners\nwith Paul Lavercombe saving off the line and keeper\nJames Whiteham having an inspired game kept the\nscore 0-0 at half time.\nAfter the re-start Holloway got a penalty flick which\nslipped in under James' outstretched hand. This lifted\nIC to score on the break with Mark Lonsdale slipping\nthe ball to Gary Knaresborough who beat the keeper\nand hit it home.\nThanks to strong defending and Hari Vandeven's acrobatic clearance off the line the score remained\n1-1: a hard fought draw for IC.\nRHBNC 11-1 IC II\u20143\nIC entered the match knowing that Royal Holloway\nwould be the toughest opposition yet in the UAU. All\nour fears were realised when, after 10 minutes,\nHolloway deservedly took the lead following some\nscrappy defending by IC. This, it appeared, was what\nIC needed, and we almost immediately took control\nof the game. However, the pitch denied us until 1\nminute before half-time when Steve Burton struck\nclearly past the keeper to provide the equalise r. After the interval the game was one sided; solid\ndefence and good distribution from the half backs\nproviding the forwards with plenty of ball. However,\nit took the clockwork-like short corner routine to put\nIC ahead-a good clean stop by Dave Millard allowing\nColin Wright to shoot the ball home. The match was\nput beyond doubt 3 minutes from time when Colin\nWright converted a penalty flick, following a deliberate\nuse of feet to prevent Dom Howard from scoring.\nWith this 3-1 victory, IC knew they ought to go\nthrough to the next round of the UAU in 1st place,\nso a riotous bar night was had by all!\nCross\nCountry\nIn the second London College League race, held in\nGuildford, IC's first men's team achieved a one point\nvictory over Oxford Poly to extend their overall lead\nin the league.\nThe going was heavy and conditions very cold and\nwindy. However, Paul Northrop kept his from together\nto finish 6th. Alex Gaskell was in danger of being\nblown away by the wind, but kept his feet on the\nground long enough to come 17th. Surging through\nin the closing stages was Dave Knight, his long loping\nstride once again proving too much for Dr John\nRowland.\nHelen Macintosh's6 th place in the women's race\nwas the best position by an IC runner for several\nyears. Sonya Legg's12 th place was also a considerable improvement.\nAs the season hots up, Imperial should again be\nproving they are the governors.\n\n"

    "content": "Nasty Life\nSci\nDear Dave,\nFurther to the letters which you received on the subject last week, I should like to make the following points clear:\n1. The letter I wrote originally was not intended as\na personal attack on Ms Marsh but was a general\ncomment on occur en ces within the Life Sciences Department. As was pointed out by Ms Park in, I'm sure that if the same opportunities presented themselves to any other student, they would not be\nturned down. However, it is a fact that any student\n(not only in Life Sci) who converses with their\nlecturers on a friendly basis is likely to be looked on more favourably in borderline cases than someone who just turns up for lectures without becoming involved in any sort of social intercourse. Life\nScientists are frequently among the more gregarious\nof students, but does this mean that those students who are less so should be unfairly treated as a result?\n2. Applied Biologists were specifically told not to take an overseas placement because some lecturers\ninitially refused to set a separate exam for those\npeople to sit. This was compounded by the AUT action which caused some exams to be postponed until the summer, when all students( supposedly)\nwere required to sit the exam together.\n3. At some later date, some of these lecturers\nchanged their minds and decided to set subsequent papers for anyone who still needed to sit those exams.4. One of the papers in the second round of exams bore three (out of eight) questions which were identical to those set in the first exam. Was there any point in writing a new paper, since it was only required\nto answer four essay questions? The Life Sciences Department obviously follows the same philosophy as Mr Aldridge' students have no rights'. Not to fairness, anyway. Name still withheld by request.\nFox says\nnepotism\nDear Dave,\nIam writing in response to the letter entitled\n' Cons oc Fox Hunt' in last week's FELIX by Mr Mark Page. There are one or two points that I wish to clear up, starting with why I stood for Chairman last March. I have always been interested in politics and joined\nCons oc as it is the only political society at IC, eventhough I have never been a 'true blue'. This fact was well known to the members of Cons oc when they elected me they felt that I would run the Society efficiently, having had much experience with the Union,S CC and treasury, and leave the Tory image to them. It is strange to note that my opponent for the post of Chairman was none other than Mr Page\nhimself. Maybe if he had spent more time helping with the Society and less time organising a professional\ncampaign with the help of his father Mr R Page\nMP he would not have sustained the crushing defeat\nwhich has obviously caused the personal attack on me. If he truly felt that I had wounded the Society he would not have written the letter, but supported my decision as most of the other committee members have. Page18 As to my personal reasons for resigning, I explained\nthem to FELIX at the interview and made it clear that\nI wished them to remain personal. The fact that\neveryone automatically assumed that I was pro-loans,\npro-poll tax, pro hanging and worshipped Mr sT are\ngrounds for any community minded person to resign.\nBut on a final point, Ido agree with Mr Page that\nCons oc now needs a good chairman and fortunately\nhe sustained another defeat, this time to Dylan\nJames so maybe Cons och as a chance after all!\nNicky Fox, Former Consoc Chairman.\nThe Page\nturns\nDear Dave,\nI wish to correct the false impression that may have\nbeen given by the letter written by Mr Mark Page last\nweek. I would like to congratulate Mr Page on the timing of his personal attack on Nicky Fox, but unfortunately\nhis assessment of the political mood within the Conservative Society stinks. I mentioned timing because it is surely no coincidence that his outburst\nappeared on the same day that the new Chairman of\nConS oc was due to be elected, and that Mr Page was standing for the post.\nContrary to popular opinion you do not have to have\nblind faith in Maggie' sTen Commandments to be a member of ConS oc or sit on its committee, and Nicky had made her political views known before she was elected as Chairman. Incidentally, the loser in this\nelection for Chairman was Mr Page. No pressure was put on Nicky to resign by any member of ConS oc, and we are very happy with the work that she has done for the Society. Iam by far the longest serving committee member of the Conservative Society, and in my opinion, Nicky ranks as one of the best Chairmen I have seen in my( long) years at College. Iam sure that Iam speaking for the rest of the committee and membership in\nsaying that we are all sorry to see Nicky stand down as Chairman. She is still staying on the committee in\nan a divisor y role and I have every confidence in the new Chairman doing an equally good job. Yours sincerely,\nAshley Unitt.\nWyatt\nwing eing Dear Dave,\nI write in reply to Thomas Wyatt' s letter last week wing eing about the lack of publicity regarding the UG Mon Thursday. Iam the Union Publicity Officer\nand as such, on Tuesday night from11.30 pm to 1 am,I stuck100 posters up around College advertising the U GM. Maybe100 posters isn't enough. Maybe whining dick heads like Mr Wyatt would like to help me put posters up. Stop wing eing and do something Mr Wyatt. Sfeve Meyfroidt, ICU Publicity Officer.\nSalter\nprize\nDear Dave,\nI was pleased to see that you publicised the existence of the Salter's Institute prizes into day's edition of FELIX( issue 8 4 9 ) . You might be interested\nin knowing that IC Chemical Engineering students have won these prizes for the past two years; Alan Gelder was a winner in 1 9 8 9 and ex ICU President,\nNigel Baker, in1988. Yours sincerely,\nLS Kershenbaum, Senior Tutor, Chem Eng.\nCypriot\nthanks\nDear Editor,\nI would like to thank the ST A Office for responding immediately to a letter sent by our Society and removing the advertisement of holidays to northern\nCyprus. This advertisement has caused great distress\namong the members of our Society. Many of us, including myself, are refugees from this part of Cyprus. I would also add that the so-called ' Republic of Northern Cyprus' is an illegal state, not recognized by the United Nations. It has been occupied by Turkish\nmilitary troops since 1 9 7 4 . It is these troops that have\nthrown us out of our houses and made us refugees\nin our own country. It is unacceptable for this ' State' to advertise holidays in our own land while we, its\nlawful owners, cannot go there.\nGeorge Kalisperides, Chairman IC Cypriot Society.\nSTA\ncomment\nDear Dave,\nI feel I should write to you in response to the letter\nfrom the Hellenic Society that appeared in issue 8 4 9\nof FELIX. No students will have seen adverts in our shop for holidays for Northern Cyprus as we do not advertise\nthe destination.\nST A is a company with over a hundred offices\nworldwide. In order to maintain our position as the leading independent travel specialist and to continue to serve the travel needs of students worldwide it is\nnecessary to sell travel to every world destination. We do not seek to make profits from the violation of human rights, for example we no longer advertise\nChina and we have removed it from the Student Travel Handbook. In addition we are currently involved\nwith theN US in sponsoring the South African Support\nGrant Scheme, whereby students can study in Britain\nfor up to three years.\nWhile we do not intentionally advertise trips to Northern Cyprus as a travel company we have to supply a service for destinations throughout the world. I hope this will resolve the situation.\nYours sincerely,\nRichard Thair, Manager STA Travel.\n\n"

He said he is\ntrying to claim from insurance for it.\n'This is horrible vandalism', he added. Tt will cost\nthe hall quite dearly.'\nMr Phil Clapp, sub warden of the hall, said that the\nattack occured at about 3 a.m. on the night of the 5th of November and that it 'seems strange that nobody\nheard it'.\nA reward of \u00a3200 has been offered for information\nleading to the apprehension of the thief. \u00a3100 of the\nreward is coming from the hall, and \u00a3100 from the\nvideo machine supplier.\n'If we dont catch the person or people involved,\nwe must pay up, insurance won't cover it', said Mr.\nClapp.\nLoans march\nnext week\nThe National Union of Students, London Branch\n(NUS London), has organised a march for the 22nd November to protest over the Government's Student\nLoans proposals. The march will start from the\nUniversity of London Student Union building in Malet\nstreet at 1:00 pm.\nA spokesperson from the NUS told FELIX that at\na preliminary rally yesterday (Thursday) 3500 people\nattended, 'so the march should be well attended'.\nImperial College Union has not yet decided whether\nit will support the march or not, though a group of\nstudents against loans are to meet in Beit Arch at 12:15\npm on that date.\nRCS bike\nfilched\nThe Royal College of Science (RCS) Union have had\ntheir tr and em bicycle kidnapped.\nThe daring felon left a poison pen letter explaining\nthe ransom demand would come later and signed it\n'a man called Horace'.\nA top ranking official of the RCS Union said 'No\ncomment', though it is understood that the combined\nforces of Scotland Yard and MI5 are working hard\nto solve this heinous crime.\nRag week\nroundup\n'Everything has been a success' concerning rag week\nso far, claimed Fiona Nicholas, ICU Hon. Sec.\n(Events). She said that the 'Exec Initiative ' took place\nlast Tuesday when twelve people, including the ICU\nexecutive , were chained in pairs and left in\nDitchingley.\nThey had been searched beforehand as they were\nonly allowed one ten pence piece each and had to get\nhome on that. Ms Nicholas said that between them\nthey had managed to smuggle four credit cards, a service till card, \u00a380 and a pair of pliers, though she\nclaimed she didn't know who had brought the pliers\nor why.\nShe went on to say that after a pub crawl (during\nwhich Mr Rob Rowe Phoned the FELIX office and\nconfided that 'Fish are nothing like sheep') they\ncaught a train and went home. She claimed that some\nmoney was raised, though she didn't know how much.\nMs Nicholas told FELIX that the raft race across\nthe Serpentine had to be cancelled as 'the rag\norganisers had asked permission from the wrong\npolice', and so were stopped by the right police during\nthe crossing attempt. There is the possibility of a \u00a32400 fine.\nThe Hypnosis lecture was a 'storming success',\nduring which over \u00a31000 was raised.\nHal Calamvokis, Rag chairman, complained that\n'the ICU exec wimp ed out of exec torture on Thursday\nlunchtime it will happen this lunchtime (Friday)\nalong with Aerosoc darts and the Monster Boat Race\nin Beit Quad'. Free beer will be available as from\n12:30 in the same place.\nGet on\ntelevision\nA new generation of intrepid reporters are required\nto reveal all about their summer jobs in a Channel\nfour series to be recorded soon. The Clark Production\nCompany is looking for students who will report on\ntheir employment experiences, in particular their\ntreatment and if it served as a preparation for 'real\nwork'.\nFurther details can be obtained from Alec Goulden,\nClark Production, Freepost 20, London W1E 4 YZ.

'Oh tw at'( GNAT).\nThe Delator Column\nBy Paul Shanley\nAt last week's UGM, a speaker challenged the quorum\nof the meeting, thereby bringing it to a premature\nfinish-as less than 300 students were present.\nWriting in FELIX on Friday we explained his reason\nfor this course of action. I won't dwell on that here\nbut I would like to expound on UGMs in general.\nThe trend of low-attend en ce UGMs has only\nemerged in recent years. As recently as six or seven\nyears ago, the average attend en ce was about 350.\nOne problem lies in publicity of meetings. It used\nto be the case that motions were submitted to the\nFELIX Editor in the form of a pre-printed 'exec news'.\nThis was then collated into FELIX on a Thursday night.\nThe advantages of this system are numerous:\n\u2022 Everyone gets to read the motions beforehand to\nenable them to lobby support for any contentious\nmotions.\n\u2022 The Union Office becomes more effective in its\nactivities; ie making an effort to inform the student\nbody of what's going on.\n\u2022 FELIX remains editorially free from the Union by\nputting production of exec news in the hands of the\nUnion Office.\nmajority are bored with the whole process. They don't care what sabbaticals and other officers get up to.\nAfter all, it doesn't affect them, does it? Well, maybe,\nmaybe not. Having seen the CCU's make dick heads of themselves at the fresher s' UGMs, people tar IC\nUGMs with the same brush and stay away. The\nconsensus appears to be anal ago us to the woman\nwith only one child-'Well, I tried it once but I didn't like it'.\nSo how do you liven a meeting up? The first way\nis to encourage audience participation. Inform Joe\nStudent how to word a motion; it can be on any topic\n(my maiden motion was on George, Bungle & Zippy).\nSlip a few dod gy motions in, say 300% pay rises for\nsabbaticals, to wind people up. Most people say 'Oh\nI still wouldn't go to a UGM'. Let's list four possible\nmotions for the next UGM:\n1. Women to be banned from the Union Bar.\n2. Freshers' Week parties to be made 'whites only'.\n3. All students of Irish decent to be searched on entry\nto Beit Quad.\n4. Mandatory HIV tests for all members of Gay\nSociety.\nThis last point has been a contentious one. Within the Disgusted? You should be. It would be an outrage if\nold Hon See's job description, fell the production of\npapers and minutes, such as exec news. Since the\nUnion re-organisation, there is now a gap, as this\nresponsibility is no longer within the remit of any\nUnion officer.\nCurrently, there is no job description for UGM\nChairman. When this is drawn up (hopefully this term),\nthe responsibility for exec news should become one\nof his/her duties.\nThe publicity clearly has to be better. It is not\nenough to place 100 papers on the Sherfield Walkway\nand expect people to read them-the fact is they\ndon't. Posters should be sited in departments and\ncommon rooms with the co-operation of dep reps-it\nis not fair to expect the Union Publicity Officer to carry\nout this task on his own. The Publicity Officer's job\nis to ensure that the posters are eye-catching (the age\nold problem).\nClubs and societies should be heavily (if not totally)\ndiscouraged from holding any meeting or gathering\nthat clashes with a UGM, on the proviso that there\nare no extenuating circumstances. The last UGM was\nheld at the same time as Norman Tebbit speaking at\na ConSoc meeting. Whether this affected the turn-out\nis a moot point.\nOkay, so far so good. But this is only one side of\nthe coin. It is assumed that if UGMs are widely known\nabout, then students will flock from miles around to\nattend. Of course, this isn't the case.\nProbably the main reason for apathy is that the\nsuch policies were even discussed. (Incidentally, two\nof the above have been seriously suggested in recent\nyears and another was Union policy until 1975). But\nask yourself this. If you knew one of those items was\non the agenda, wouldn't you turn up? If you didn't attend and everyone else did likewise, how would you\nfeel if that policy was passed?\nThis is obviously looking at an extreme, but it\ndemonstrates a point. If sufficient numbers are pro-or anti- a proposal, they will turn up and vote.\nOn a lighter note, UGMs should be made more\nentertaining. Officers' reports should be kept to a minimum. Procedure should be adhered to but not in\na sense where the standing orders appear to have\nprecedence over the meeting's business.\nThere is a problem with UGMs being conducted in\na place which is non-conducive to the right\natmosphere. In my belief, the decision, three years\nago, to move UGMs from the Great Hall to the JCR\nhas had no effect other than to fiddle the quorum. The\nargument about easy accessibility is a red herring.\nEveryone knows where the Great Hall is; if they are\ngoing to attend a meeting, they'll turn up irrespective\nof the venue.\nTo summarise, the Union faces a charge of being\nunrepresentative of its members. There is an equal\nshare of the blame. The UGM machinery must work\nmore effectively, to encourage attendance, to inform\nof a meeting's business. Students should play a part\nin the running of the Union, that's what it's there for.\nPage 8\n\n"
