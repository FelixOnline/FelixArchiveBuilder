Imperial\nCollege should be a place\nwhere students from all\nover the world, including\nChina, as well as Hong\nKong and Taiwan which\nare by all means parts\nthat cannot be separated\nfrom China. Students can\ncome to study, progress,\nand live peacefully\ntogether. However, Mr.\nTitmuss published this\narticle which is clearly\nabout politics, a topic\nthat is not encouraged\nat Imperial, without any\nperceivable attempt to\nseek the truth. Instead,\nhe has written an article\nthat is biased, flawed,\narrogant, humiliating, and\nirresponsible. This should\nnot be tolerated under any\ncircumstances.\nFirst of all, as Mr.\nTitmuss seems to be an\nadvocator of freedom of\nspeech, I would first like\nto ask a question here, not\nonly to Mr. Titmuss, but\nalso to all those who are\nnow believe that mainland\nChina is a so-called\n\u201coppressive\u201d regime\naccording to Western in-terpretations. Here is the\nquestion: Do you know\nthat THE EXERCISE OF\nFREEDOM OF SPEECH\nCARRIES SPECIAL\nDUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES? It is clearly\nstated in the International\nCovenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights (ICCPR).\nFurthermore, it is subject\nto certain restrictions \u201cfor\nof the article to the leader\nof our country, and flawed\nreference to China as \u201coppressive,\u201d is unacceptable,\nas it harms the reputation\nof our country. Therefore,\ninclusive atmosphere. I\nwould like to talk about\nmy own experience. The\nfirst night I arrived at my\nhall of residence, we had\na floor dinner. One of my\nfloor-mates from the UK\nasked about the situation\nin Hong Kong. My answer\nwas that mainlanders and\nHong Kong students may\nhold different opinions.\nA Hong Kong student\nagreed and said we should\nnot talk about it. While\nthis was not the best situation as we didn\u2019t fully\nexchange our ideas, it\nwas at least not the worst\nwhere an argument may\nhave occurred. I personally respect the attempts of\nhas happened in Hong\nKong recently is far from\npeaceful. From vandalism\nby painting and smashing\nwindows of government\nbuildings protesters have\nmoved to attacking police\nofficers using iron pipes,\nmolotovs, and even petroleum bombs. I have the\nsense that western media\nlike the BBC, CNN report\nevents selectively, as\nthey had always done, to\npicture China as \u201coppressive\u201d which is not true.\nThey show their audience\npolice reacting using\narms without telling you\nhow violent the protests\nwere. While Western\ncountries claim that they\nhave freedom of the press\nwhich \u201cChina does not\nhave,\u201d I always find this\nstatement ridiculous and\nsad. The fact is that people\noutside mainland China,\neven those in Hong Kong,\nhave long been deceived\nby the distorted facts\nintentionally reported by\nthe media. I suppose Mr.\nTitmuss is not aware of\nthat, therefore I think his\narticle is irresponsible,\nand is not part of properly\npracticing the freedom of\nspeech.\nBeing in the UK for\nnearly a month, I used\nYouTube a lot to watch\nvideos about China from\na western perspective.\nI found that people\noutside China had a lot\nof misunderstandings and\nstereotypes about China.\nHere I will list some that\nare prevailing:\nChina wants to rule\nthe world or East Asia\nChina is ruled by a\ncommunist party so it is\nbad\nChina is a so-called oppressive regime according to Western Interpretations // Wikimedia\n\u201cTHE EXERCISE OF FREEDOM\nSPEECH CARRIES SPECIAL\nDUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\u201d\nthe rights or reputation of\nothers\u201dand\u201ctheprotection\nof national security or of\npublic order.\u201d Mr. Titmuss\nsuccessfully practiced his\nfreedom of speech and I\ndon\u2019t have a problem with\nit, but his insult at the end\nI hope an apology can\nbe made by Mr. Titmuss\nin public to all Chinese\nstudents at Imperial and to\nour nation.\nAs a visitor here, I feel\ngenerally pleased because\nImperial has a culturally\n\u201cI hope an\napology can\nbe made by\nMr Titmuss\nin public to\nall Chinese\nstudents at\nImperial and to\nour nation\u201d\na few rational Hong Kong\nlocals to call for freedom\npeacefully.

The most\noft-quoted metric\nof this are the National\nStudent Survey scores for\nstudent satisfaction \u2013 nat-urally, Imperial students\ntend to the quantitative\ndata first. Scores have\nfallen to a startling degree\nover the past several years,\nstarting most notably in\n2015.\nI do try not to fear\nthat this is because I\njoined the College in the\n2014-2015 year, and thus\nbrought doom and gloom\nupon you all. My slightly\nnarcissistic, reptilian\nbrain can\u2019t quite shake the\nfeeling.\nOf course, the evidence\nis perhaps more obvious\nin the qualitative sense.\nThe jokes we make,\nthe IC Exposed posts\n\u2013 they\u2019re relentlessly\nnegative. Mental health\nbreakdowns have become\na norm, to the extent that\nit\u2019s topical enough for us\nto use humour to bear the\ntragedy. That\u2019s always a\ngood marker for an issue\nbeing endemic \u2013 when\nit\u2019s a reference made\noff-handedly; when the\nlore of humour around it\nstarts to become complex\nand take on a life of its\nown. It\u2019s when you make\nmeta-memes about it. It\u2019s\nintrinsic at that stage. We\nhave long since surpassed\nthat point.\nEven as someone who\nis no longer a student,\nand as someone who gets\nasked if they\u2019re \u201call right\u201d\nabout 12 times a day,\nI\u2019m fairly sure I\u2019ve given\nthe same half-joking\nresponse every time for\nthe past several weeks:\n\u201coh, surviving.\u201d Nobody\nquestions it \u2013 they laugh,\nor give a knowing smile\nthat speaks not of sympa-thy, but of empathy. \u201cMe\ntoo,\u201d it says. \u201cI get that\nfeeling.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think there\ncould be a clearer sign of\nthe problem \u2013 no, not even\na statistical one drawn\non a pretty graph. It\u2019s\nbeen the same since I got\nhere. We\u2019re quite a tame\nuniversity in many ways,\nsuch that our social hazing\nof new entrants doesn\u2019t\ntake the American frater-nity-esque overtone of\nridiculous and humiliating\ntasks, but rather unnerving\nthem with assurances that\ntheir mental health is soon\nto collapse.\nThat\u2019s not normal. That\nshouldn\u2019t be so common\nas to become a community\nritual, as our own trial-by-fire upon entrance to the\nuniversity. But it is.\nWhat\u2019s rapidly chang-ing, it appears, is the College\u2019s interpretation and\nresponse. This comes as a\nsurprise to older students,\nwho generally feel very\nentrenched at this point in\nthe view that the College\ndoes not care about them.\nPerhaps my brief and\nextremely scientifically\nvalid survey of the Felix\noffice is more biased than\nthe most p-hacked of\npapers in the \u2018Journal of\nAdvanced Journalology\u2019,\nbut I still feel it valid \u2013 I\nfeel that the feedback is\nconsistent no matter who\nI talk to.\nBut undeniably it\nis happening. New\nbuzzwords abound. My\nfavourite is \u201cholistic\u201d;\na close second is \u201cinterlinked\u201d. It is evident in\nthe thinking of both the\nCollege and the Union.\nIt is, in fact, becoming\nendemic in itself. Maybe\nhaving such deeply-em-bedded thinking shaping\nevery decision in a unilateral way is the more\nfundamental underlying\nproblem, but I\u2019ll take this\nover what existed before.\nEveryone I interview\nseems energised. Tired,\noften, but energised. This\nis, to a large extent, a\nrenaissance in College\nattitudes and approaches.\nThe idea that problems are\nnot isolated to individual\npeople, departments, or\nfaculties, but are sourced\nin the atmosphere and experience of simply being\nat the College, seems to\nbe genuinely new.\nIt\u2019s the result of hitting\na crux point, a catalyst\nmoment. The renewal of\nthe directing Strategies\nof the College have intersected with a student body\nthat is finally sick to the\nback teeth and becoming\na little more vocal. They\nelected Union sabbatical\nofficers with a fair bit of\nfire and backbone, who\nhave already announced\nambitious plans to renegotiate rent and tackle big\nstructural decision-mak-ing issues. For Imperial\nstudents, characteristically quiet and with the\nstiffest upper lips known\nthe mankind, this is equivalent to screaming aloud.\nAnd so we see what\nappears to be a genuine\ndedication to change; to\nshake things up; to fund\nand invest and support\nthe innovative. I\u2019ve been\ngenuinely surprised in\nmy interactions with\npeople across the College,\nespecially at the level of\nupper management, given\nI am part of the corrupted\n\u2018golden oldies\u2019 who\njoined a few years ago\nand have been taught to\nbe disheartened.\nThis week, we spoke\nto the two staff members\nrunning Chemical\nKitchen, an off-the-wall\nidea that flies in the face\nof traditional teaching\nperspectives. We ran\na double spread in the\nfreshers\u2019 issue about\nthe development of a\nhigh-tech and interactive\n\u2018active learning\u2019 space in\nBlackett. We won\u2019t shut\nthe hell up about the move\nto White City and what\nthat means and entails.\nEverywhere I look for\nnews around the College,\nthese themes pop up \u2013 it\u2019s\nabout change, growth,\nthrowing out the old.\nI do wonder if this is a\nreflection, in some ways,\nof the UK voting for\nBrexit \u2013 which, whether\nyou agree or disagree with\nit, can almost surely be\nreferred to as a \u201cprotest\nvote\u201d in response to the\nutter stagnancy of British\npolitics prior. I\u2019d argue\nthat Donald Trump\u2019s\nelection in the US was\na similar phenomenon.\nIt\u2019s a lurching away from\nthe status quo. Our little\nImperial community, at\nevery level, is doing the\nsame thing \u2013 rubber-band-ing away from what\nexisted before. \u2018We are\nnot happy, and we need to\nchange things.\u2019\nI see this as needed,\nbut I am concerned that\nin the fervour not enough\nconsideration of future\nramifications is being\ngiven. That may be a topic\nfor another editorial, but\nthis is my hot take of the\nweek.\nCentrefold // Taja Strle\nI\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFRIDAY, 8TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA fairytale on Old Compton Street - Soho Cinders\nA\nfter an initial\nrun back in\n2012, Soho\nCinders is back\noff the west end at the\nCharing Cross Theatre,\nand its unique narrative\nand warm characters\nare more relevant than\never. Set on the iconic\nOld Compton Street in\nthe beating heart of the\nWest End, this modern\nCinderella sees young\nRobbie (Luke Bayer) navigate a rather complicated\nlove life. Sugar daddies\nreplace fairy god mothers\nand a closeted mayoral\ncandidate may just be his\nPrince Charming!\nThe opening number\n\u201cOld Compton Street\u201d\nreally encapsulates the\ntheme of the rest of the\nmusical. Setting the story\nin such a recognizable\nplace gives an instant connection to the audience\nwho themselves may have\nspent many nights in the\nSoho area. For those who\nhaven\u2019t, the essence of\nthis street is explained.\nTheatre goers, winers\nand diners, and a much\nyounger crowd all flood\nthe street every day - albeit\nat very different times.\nThe times where these\ndemographics overlap\ngives a real insight into\nthe diversity that makes\nLondon the best city in the\nworld.\nNo Cinderella story,\neven this very loose retell-ing, would be complete\nwithout the ugly step\nsisters. Michaela Stern\nand Natalie Hern give a\nhilarious performance as\nthese classic characters.\nDespite being the bitchiest\nand meanest incarnation\nof the characters probably\never seen, they project a\nreal charm and have the\naudience laughing non-stop. Their song in the\nsecond half, with them-dressed in unicorn onesies\nfor their 15 minutes of\nfame, does seem a bit\nout of place in what is\notherwise a much more\nfocused and intense part\nof the musical. Nevertheless, stumbling across the\nstage drunk and singing\nat the top of their lungs\nwhile still hitting all the\npunchlines takes real skill.\nDespite the title and\npremise of a Cinderella\nretelling, this seldom\nactually becomes important for the plot. What\nmakes this story so special\nis the depth of each char-acter. Even supporting\ncharacters have their\nmoment in the spotlight\nand win over the audience\nin their own way. For\nexample, Ewan Gillies\ngives an exceptional performance as the Malcolm\nTucker-esque spin doctor,\nraising the bar for singing\nand drama for everyone.\nThe fianc\u00e9, played by Tori\nHargeaves, seemed a bit\none-dimensional and quite\nfrankly inconsequential in\nthe first half but is then\npresented to the audience\nin a much more nuanced\nand complete way after the\ninterval.Aspecial mention\nfor Millie O\u2019Connell\nwho plays the best friend\nVelcro who brings a real\nhuman touch to the story.\nDespite not being given\nthat much stage time, her\nperformance is arguably\nthe most impactful.\nWhether you are\nlooking for a sappy\nromance story, a political\nthriller, or just a bit of\na laugh, this modern\nmusical has it all. Come\ndown to The Charing\nCross Theatre for a\nshow that will have you\ndancing, laughing, and\ncrying the night away!\nThe Magic Flute - Mozart\u2019s classic\nI\nt isn\u2019t easy to picture\na more magical setting than sitting in the\nhistorical auditorium\nof the Royal Opera House\nas you listen to the over-ture, eagerly waiting for\nthe curtain to rise.\nBack for its seventh\nrevival at Covent Garden,\nMozart\u2019s Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (The Magic Flute)\nmanages to retain the level\nof excitement and exhilaration throughout the\nthree-hour performance.\nNeedless to say, both the\nmusic and singing are\nexceptionally melodious,\nand the production lives\nup to all expectations, an\nimpressive treat for both\nthe ears and the eyes.\nThe director also strikes\na perfect balance between\nthe solemnity of opera and\nthe comedy inherent to the\nplot presenting Mozart\u2019s\nmasterpiece in an elegant\nand joyful manner.\nThe Opera follows\nPrince Tamino and\nPapageno\u2019s adventures\nguided by the Three Boys\nto rescue the daughter of\nthe Queen of the Night,\nPamina. The cast is excel-lent, each with their own\ncharacterful and distinct\nvoice that combine to\nform an enchanting whole.\nEvery voice has a recognisable originality, be it its\ntone, richness, intensity,\nor depth. It is simply remarkable that the human\nvoice can convey such\ncomplicated emotions\nand illuminate each\ncharacter\u2019s personality.\nSome of the standout performances were given by\nVito Priante as Papageno,\nsinging \u2018Der Vogelf\u00e4nger\nbin ich ja\u2019 very cheerfully\nand lightly, suited for the\nrole, for he is an endearing\nand injudicious character.\nBenjamin Hulett as\nTamino has a firm and\ngentle voice, reflecting\nhis nobility as Prince. The\ndelicate harmony between\nthe Three Boys are most\nclear and delectable, and\nQueen of the Night\u2019s effortless \u2018Der H\u00f6lle Rache\nkocht in meinem Herzen\u2019\nby Tuuli Takala is also not\nto be missed.\nThe performance is\nenhanced by the magnificent set design by\nJohn Macfarlane and the\ndetails included in the\ncostumes and props. From\nthe serpent in the opening\nscene manipulated by\nover 10 actors, the flying\nmachine that carries the\nThreeBoys,themonstrous\ntree, to a grand sun in the\nfinale, the large-scale set\ndesigns add the finishing\ntouches to an already\nstunning performance.\nThe playful direction\nby David McVicar also\nenlivens the stage. The\nunexpected entrances of\nPapageno from the Stall\nCircle seats, clambering\nover the separation to\nget to the stage, and his\nhumorous dialogues with\nTamino are especially\nvivid and convey the\ncomical side of Mozart\u2019s\npersonality itself.\nPerhaps, a slight twist\nand some innovative interpretations and approaches\nwould have given the\naudience some unanticipated joy. Nonetheless,\nthe technical and musical\nsophistication of the production is nothing short of\nphenomenal. Directed by\nDavid McVicar and featuring some of the most\niconic pieces of music,\nMozart\u2019s last opera Die\nZauberfl\u00f6te is on its run\nfrom the 1st\nuntil the 27th\nof November at the Royal\nOpera House.

Unless all\nhumans except Chinese\nnationals died out, China\nwould not seek any form\nof global or regional\nhegemony. Please do\nnot take that seriously,\nbut more authoritative\ncomments have been\ngiven by those who have\na say on this again and\nthe Chinese Communist\nParty has its problems,\nbut I still believe it is the\nbest party to make China\nprosperous, which is the\nwill of all Chinese. We\ndon\u2019t want any form of\nforeign-imposed values\nand systems because that\nbrings back the memory of\nthe humiliating history of\nthe 19th and 20th century.\nWe don\u2019t export our\ncommunist ideology, and\nat the same time, we don\u2019t\nwant any foreign party\nto export their ideas and\nvalues to us by force. We\nhave our own way, and we\nneed mutual respect. As a\nguest here, I respectfully\npoint out that your \u201cdemocratic multi-party system\u201d\nis more problematic than a\n\u201cnot democratic one-party\nautocracy\u201d and will not\ndo any good to China, so\nplease just focus on your\nown countries and stop\ntelling China what you\nwant us to do.\nThe fourth one is true\nto some extent, but what\nChina did has nothing\nto do with threatening\nforeign companies in\nChina. It is agreed around\nthe globe that a corporation should obey the\nlocal laws in order to be\nable to do the business,\nand there is no exception\nin China. In China, it is\nillegal to spread ideas\ncontaining separatism,\nhate, racism and terrorism online. I believe it\nshould have counterparts\nin British and American\nlegal system (otherwise\nit means the \u201coppressive\u201d\nChinese legal system\nis actually better). The\nBlizzard occurrence\nhappened because it is\nfound that some Hong\nKong protesters spread\nillegal content mentioned\nabove in games, so by\nlaw Chinese government\nasked Blizzard to censor\nthe chats in games. If\nBlizzard were to allow\nthose contents, the\nChinese government have\nto right to stop its services\nin China. So again, I\nwould like to emphasize\nthat this is not about the\nproblem of freedom of\nspeech, because duties\nand responsibilities are\nnot separable. By this I\nthink the fifth misunderstanding is also clarified.\nThe sixth point is the\nmost prevailing of all. To\nmake it simple, I would\nsay that the statement is\nby Henry Kissinger, the\nformer United States Secretary of State. The book\nmight be boring, but as a\nChinese national, I found\nthe content very objective\nand especially sharp on\nhis analysis about how\nthe Chinese think and\nhow is it influenced by the\nChinese history. There is\nalso a YouTuber Nathan\nRich who uploaded\nseveral videos about\nChina that you wouldn\u2019t\nknow from Western media\nreports. It will probably\nbe a mind-changing\nprocess, and I am willing\nto provide help to any\nfriends from any cultural\nbackground if possible.\nI hope this initiative can\nboost the communication\nbetween all ethnic groups\nat Imperial.\nshort, the difference is\nso large and Western\npeople should accept the\nfact that your values and\nethics does not prevail\nover others\u2019.

The\nFalcons are a big rival\nto the team, so this was\na great chance to set a\nstrong start to the season.\nThe game started off\nstrong. However, the\nFalcons were the first\nto score and go 7-0 up.\nDespite this, some quick\nscramble drills from\nSebastiano \u201cFade = Life\u201d\nZane brought the team\ntwo touchdowns, making\nthe score 14-14 just before\nthe end of the half. The\nsquad was determined to\nmake a strong start to the\nseason -nothing would\nstop them- so much so that\nPunter \u201cWho\u2019s Daniel?\u201d\nLoughran made a solid\ngain with one of the\nFalcons\u2019 defensive backs\nhanging off him. Both\nsides fought hard for the\nrest of the half, meaning\nthere was little separating the two with the score\nbeing 22-14 at half time.\nAfter the break both the\ncompetition were back on\nas everyone was fighting\nto seize the final victory.\nThe Immortals were\ngiving it their all, and\nit seemed as though\nthere was a chance for a\ncomeback when Killian\n\u201cConcussion King\u201d\nGymrek intercepted the\nball and caused disruption\nto the Kent offensive\ndrive; however, we were\nunable to capitalize\nupon this.

    "content": "15\nISSUE 1733\nFELIX\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nPolitics Writer\nI\nn the previous article\nit was established that\nthe state is a necessity\nfor capitalism, as\nwithout a state private\nproperty rights could not\nbe enforced. A state was\ndefined by political economist Max Weber as \u201ca\npolitical entity that maintains a monopoly on the\nuse of violence\u201d. We discussed how this violence\nis wielded by the state for\nthe enforcement of its\u2019\nlaws and private property\nrights domestically; but\nhow else is the state used\nto prop up capitalism?\nOn the domestic front,\nthe judicial system has\nallowed for interpretations of free speech law\nthat permit corporate\nlobbying and funding.\nIn the US, the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s \u2018Citizens\nUnited\u2019 decision meant\nthat corporations could\nfreely spend money on\npolitical communications as a form of \u2018free\nspeech\u2019 \u2013 allowing for\na strengthening of the\ninfluence of corporations in liberal democ-racies. This influence\naffects everything from\ndomestic to foreign\npolicy.\nThe police play the\nmain part in exercising\na state\u2019s power domes-tically, and the military\ndoes so globally. The\njudicial system is meant\nto hold these bodies and\nindividuals to account,\nand does so with varying\nlevels of success. Often,\nhowever, we see that the\npolice and military are\nmore or less kept protected by the judicial system\nas it is in the state\u2019s best\ninterests that these units\nwork together. When it\ncomes to racially biased\npolice brutality, or even\nwar crimes abroad,\nthe courts often acquit\npolice and military\nofficers involved with\nthese incidents despite\nevidence of wrongdo-ing..\nThe protection\nafforded to the police\nand military allows\nthem to operate more\nor less freely on behalf\nof the state to further\nthe state\u2019s interests,\nand thus capitalist\ninterests. For example,\nstrict immigration laws\ncreate an underclass of\nmigrant workers that are\nafforded less rights and\nprotections than non\n-migrant workers. These\ncan include migrants\nwith strict visa conditions as well as those\nhere illegally, and thus\nthey can often find\nthemselves in precarious\nwork. The creation of an\nunderclass of workers\ngives employers a wider\nchoice on who they\nshould employ, and\nwith migrant workers\noften willing to work\nwhatever they can and\nfor less, this can result\nin wages falling across\nthe board. As noted in\nthe first article of this\nseries, lower wages\nmeans more of the\nvalue produced by the\nworkers goes towards\nthe capitalists as profits,\nmeaning the capitalists\nbenefit from having this\nchoice as a result of our\nimmigration laws.\nIllegal immigration\nwill always exist and\npeople will resort to\nmore and more dangerous ways to get to other\ncountries, especially\nwith the refugee crisis\nand with the impending\nrefugee crisis to come\nas a result of climate\nchange. Therefore, the\nstate enacting strict\nimmigration laws is not\nprimarily to stop or limit\nthe number of people\ncoming here, but rather\nto increase the number\nof people that are not\nafforded the same rights\nand protections as\ndomestic workers have,\nleading to falling wages\nand more profit for cap-italists.\nWhen we hear about\nrefugee crises it\u2019s also\nimportant to ask why the\ncrises are happening in\nthe first place. In Latin\nAmerica and the Middle\nto bring in profits for\nAmerican corporations.\nIn Latin America, this\nwas so common that the\nterm \u201cBanana Republic\u201d\ncame into use to describe\nsituations where this\noccurred, such as in\nHonduras with the US\ncorporation the United\nFruit Company. More\nfamously, in Iraq and\nSyria, Western intervention destabilised the\nregion leading to the\ngrowth of Daesh and\nthe subsequent refugee\ncrisis. The intervention\nproved profitable for\nthe defense and oil\nindustries. Later on, the\nIraq War was found to\nbe predicated on false\npremises.\nCapitalism has always\nbeen a global system\nthat continuously seeks\nout new resources and\nnew markets to expand\nto. Foreign policy has\nthus historically played\na key part in keeping\ncapitalism ticking. In the\nnext part we will expand\nmore on the history we\nhave discussed in this\narticle, particularly\nin the context of free\nmarkets, the global\neconomy, colonialism\nand imperialism. Stay\ntuned!\nU.S. Army provide crowd control while Iraqi citizens line up for food // Wikimedia\n\u201cIllegal\nimmigration\nwill always\nexist and\npeople will\nresort to more\nand more\ndangerous\nways to get\nto other\ncountries\u201d\nEast, we see a pattern\nof American (and\nBritish) interventionism designed to install\ngovernments that take a\nmore favourable foreign\npolicy and trading\napproach to the United\nStates \u2013 sometimes at\nthe cost of overthrowing\ndemocratically elected\nleaders to install US\nbacked dictators. These\ninterventionist wars\ncause instability in these\nregions and harm local\neconomies in order\n\u201cStrict\nimmigration\nlaws create\nan underclass\nof migrant\nworkers\u201d\nThe State we\u2019re in\u2026\nAfter a short hiatus due to the General Election call last week, we return to the\nthird part of our 8-part political economic series: \u201cWhat is Capitalism?\u201d, where we\nlook at the State: police, the judicial system, and the military.\n\n"

He was\nlater banned for breaching\nBlizzard\u2019s community\nrules speci\ufb01cally the\nrule against offending\n\u201ca portion or group of\nthe public, or otherwise\ndamag[ing] Blizzard\u2019s\nimage.\u201d Additionally,\nthe two casters on the\nlivestream were also\ndisavowed by Blizzard\nas a result of the player\u2019s\nwords, which seems rather\nunfair given that they had\nno idea what the person\nthey were interviewing\nwas actually going to\nsay \u2013 that is, without\nassuming prescience.\nTo add insult to injury,\nmembers of an inter-col-legiate Hearthstone team\nwere immediately banned\nafter they held up a piece\nof cardboard reading\n\u201cSupport Hong Kong.\u201d\nBoth of these actions\nhave gone down like a\nlead balloon in the wider\ngaming community that\nhas interpreted these\nactions as efforts to\nensure that the company\ndoes nothing to offend\nmainland Chinese sensibilities at the expense of\nfreedom of speech. Reddit\ncommunities such as r/\nBlizzard and r/Hearth-stone have been dominated with some high-quality\nmemes showing Blizzard\nas China\u2019s little bitch. Go\nand take a look. Furthermore, furious Blizzard\nassociates and employees\nhave responded by distancing themselves from\nthe company or covering\nup a rather ironic plaque\nin Blizzard HQ that reads\n\u201call voices matter.\u201d\nThis issue ties into\nwider problems that\nWestern companies have\nexperienced when operating with the Chinese\nmarket in mind. In the\nUS, a National Basketball\nAssociation manager\ntweeted in support of\nHong Kong and immediately faced the wrath of\nChina\u2019s state broadcaster\nwho threatened to pull\ntheir contract with the\nNBA. NBA representatives rapidly rowed back\nand disassociated themselves from the tweet.\nGoogle came under \ufb01re\nfor \u201cProject Dragon\ufb02y\u201d,\na search engine designed\nto work behind the Great\nFirewall. During the\nproject, it surreptitiously\ndropped one of its key\nmottos, \u201cDon\u2019t be Evil.\u201d\nChina possesses\neconomic might that most\nnations, bar the US, can\nonly dream of. The past\nand present of Chinese\neconomic development\nis intertwined with the\nChinese government, a\none-party autocracy that\nis considerably more\noppressive than others.\nWith this clash of cultures\nin mind, companies\nIt is important to point\nout, perhaps controver-sially, China is rightly free\nto operate as it wishes.\nChina is a sovereign state,\nand the West should not\nattempt to interfere with\nthe Chinese government.\nFiddling with sovereignty\nhas been a terrible experiment for the last 20 years\nof Western foreign policy,\nleading to widespread\ndisaster in almost every\ncase. However, the current\nposition of Western\ncompanies presents two\nissues, appeasement and\nabetment.\nIn order to maintain\ntheir access to the markets\nin China, companies such\nas Blizzard are willing to\nappease China by silencing critics in the West\nin return for potential\neconomic bene\ufb01ts. This\nis not acceptable. China\nmust not be allowed to\nleverage power through\neconomic manipulation\nof ethically malleable\ncompanies.\nCompanies must also\nnot abet China. Companies such as Microsoft\nmust accept moral responsibility for aiding the\nChinese government\u2019s\ngoal of information\ntotalitarianism over its\npopulation. Companies\nshould avoid working on\nprojects that are likely to\nbe ethically dubious and if\nthey do, should be forced\nto accept some form of\npenalty. Perhaps a moral\ntax as a practical means of\ndissuasion.\nCompanies have an\nopportunity to do the right\nthing. They won\u2019t, but\nwouldn\u2019t it be good if they\ndid.\nMake Xi Jinping Winnie\nthe Pooh again\nChina\u2019s lil bitch // Wikimedia\nmigrating from the West\nare often faced with the\nprospect of having to compromise whatever ethical\ncode they may have used\nin order to make a pro\ufb01t,\nhence Project Dragon\ufb02y.\nOther examples of companies wilfully ignoring\nthe ethical implications\nof their work include\nMicrosoft, with their development of AI for facial\nrecognition in concert\nwith Chinese partners. AI\nfor image recognition can\nbe used for multiple nefarious purposes of surveillance and repression, but\nthe attraction of wealth is\nmore than enough to settle\nwhatever moral qualms\nMicrosoft may have had.\nChina is now a world\nleader in this technology.\n9\n\n"

While the\nscenery is outstanding, all\nmost members remember\nof that night\u2019s drive were\nthe country lanes and\nmotion sickness of some\nfew unlucky members.\nHaving reached the hut\nafter the first car convoy,\nthe minibus squad got\nhome late in the evening\nand enjoyed a drink with\nthose who had arrived\nearlier and started the\nfire already, happy to find\nthe hut nice and warm.\nMost went to bed quickly,\nexcited about the adventures to come.\nThe next morning, all\nrose after a good night\u2019s\nsleep, fuelled on porridge,\npeanut butter, bananas and\nchorizo for the most calo-rie-hungry ones, and got\nready to tackle on Mount\nSnowdon as the wearher\nlooked promising and the\nsun coming out every now\nand then.\nHowever, the first stop\nof the day was neither\na perilous ridge or a\npath in the woods, but\nthe Cwellyn Arms: this\ntraditional Welsh Pub\nin the village of Rydd\nDhu serving 9 real ales\n9 days a week, in order\nto watch the final of the\nRWC. After 80 minutes\nof cheering fuelled with\ntea or beer for those who\nlike their morning pints,\nthe group set off to forget\ntheir sorrows and burn all\n\u201cThe first stop\nof the day\nwas neither a\nperilous ridge\nor a path in the\nwoods, but the\nCwellyn Arms\u201d\n\u201cAll set off\nwith a smile\non their face,\nready to climb\nup Mynydd\nMawr, some\nfor the second\ntime\u201d\nthose breakfast calories.\nThe first run of the trip\nwas the technical climb\nof mount Snowdon from\nRydd Dhu. About 900m\nof elevation over roughly\n7km seperated these\nmountain goats from the\nsummit, so all of them\nset off to a good pace,\nbut the steep gradient led\nall of them to slow down\ntheir efforts and approach\nsome of the segments as a\nhike. Upon reaching the\nsummit, the team opted\nfor a classic team photo,\npaused for everyone to\nhave some water and\nsome snacks, before\nsetting off for the much\nmore rapid and rather fun\nrun downhill.\nRather than going down\nthe same way they went\nup, they opted for the\nMountain Ranger path,\ntaking them by a couple of\nlakes, as the rain began to\nget heavier. However, no\nraincloud could dampen\ntheir spirits as they all\ntook in the splendid views\nand made the most of a\ngreat afternoon.\nHaving made it down\nthe mountain, the group\nthen ran back the few\nmiles from the bottom\nof the Ranger Path that\nseperated from Rydd Dhu\nwhere they had left the\nminibus and car. Upon\ntheir arrival, rather than\nheading straight home, the\nteam decided to stay for a\nbit and spend an hour in\nthe pub, with some well-earned chips and drinks\nby the fire.\nThey then returned\nto the hut, with a brave\nbunch deciding to take\non Mynydd Mawr before\ndinner. The near - 600m\nextra elevation meant that\nwhen they returned, wet\nand tired with everyone\nwell-rested and showered,\nthe decision for an early\nand high-calorie dinner\nwas swiftly taken. An\nearly dinner, a wide range\nof games and plenty of\nchatting later, the team\nheaded to bed looking\nforward to another great\nday of trail running.\nIn the morning, some\nwere feeling more fresh\nthan others after the\nevening\u2019s antics, but\nall set off with a smile\non their face, ready to\nclimb up Mynydd Mawr,\nsome for the second time\nalready. With their legs\ntired from the previous\nday\u2019s demanding efforts,\nthe shorter distance run\nstill felt very much like a\nstrong session. Reaching\nthe summit, the group\nhuddled up for a while\nbefore taking another\nsummit picture and\ndashing off down the\nsteep hills between them\nand the hut. With no need\nto take the minibus to go\nback to the hut, those most\nkeen to shower went particularly quick down the\nhills, thoroughly enjoying\nall of their potential gravitational energy turning\ninto kinetic energy, even\nwhen some stumbled and\nwent for fairly conventional mudslides.\nWith everyone back,\nthe squad showered, had\nlunch, and started packing\nin order to leave early to\nhead back to London early\nas most were keen to have\na nice dinner early and get\na good night\u2019s sleep.\nAll in all, a pretty great\nweekend which shall\nhappen again, with some\nmore likely to happen this\nyear.

We\nshould have three coordinators but just don\u2019t; they\nleft all at the same time.\nThe new roles are out for\nrecruitment now, and one\nof those shut yesterday for\nwhich we will be doing\ninterviews soon \u2013 but\nwith notice, those new\nroles won\u2019t be starting\nuntil mid-December, and\nabout who should\nhave responsibility for\nroom bookings where.\nCurrently College have\ntaken over your backlog\nof room bookings \u2013\nhow\u2019s that moving\nforward, would the\nCollege be taking over\nbookings even in the\nUnion building?\nTom: We just handed\nover their own rooms to\nCollege \u2013 I think we still\nmanage our own space.\nBefore the loss of staff,\nwe had Hannah Hart\ndoing it for Union and\nCollege buildings. We\nhave privileges and rights\nfor usage of space within\nthe Union building, but\nwe have to follow agreements with College about\ntheir space \u2013 for some\nrooms we can use them\nwhenever we want over\nthe weekend, for example,\nwhereas for others we\nneed to ask permission\nfrom building managers.\nBut Hannah has left, and\nthe loss of knowledge hits\nhard. The silver lining is\nthat her being so good at\nit hid a lot of fundamental\nissues in the background,\nand now we can see those\nand take a look at what it\nrequires in terms of time\nand resource and CSP\nengagement. It\u2019s really\ninformative for looking\nahead and at how that\nteam works. In my Union\nCouncil report, I talked\nabout mapping out our\noperations and getting\na better understanding\nof how our team works,\nbecause currently I think\nnone of us really understand it \u2013 we\u2019re too reliant\non individuals, rather than\nprocesses that are robust\nand reliable over time and\nsystems to review those\nover time.\nAs always, manifestos are\none thing \u2013 but you come\ninto the role and there\u2019s\nalways a lot more to focus\non and deal with.\nTom Fernandez-Debets, the Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)\n// ICU\nFelix: What have you\nbeen working on from\nyour manifesto?\nTom: Looking at training\nhas been one, specifically\nfor CSPofficers, academic\nreps, and so on. It\u2019s\nbecoming a much bigger\nproject in terms of developing a training strategy,\nand looking at how\nknowledge will always\nsit with the Activities and\nEducation & Representation teams, as well as how\nthe Student Development\nteam can help to build the\nframeworks and work on\ndelivery of training and\nown that side of things.\nIt\u2019s not about the content,\nbut how teams in the\nUnion can support and\nfacilitate that.\nFelix: Your predecessor,\nJames, worked all year\nreally hard on a new room\nbooking system \u2013 the\ndigital side of it. That was\nmeant to speed things\nup, but hasn\u2019t \u2013 partially\nbecause of staffing issues,\ntrue, but it wasn\u2019t enough\nto solve the problems.\nTom: I agree with that \u2013\nthere\u2019s things that need to\nbe done at the SSG level\nto improve the efficiency\nof processes. What James\ndesigned is incredible and\nwill help in the longer\nterm.This is a new system,\njust being rolled out too,\nso we perhaps haven\u2019t\nused it to its maximum\npotential yet. It will be\ninteresting to see how it\nfits in with other projects\nbeing done at the College\n\u2013 especially as it could,\nin future, allow certain\nthings to be automated\nrather than manual.\nFelix: Recruiting the\nnew coordinators, while\nalso reassessing how the\nroles and teams should\nwork. How do you plan\nto address the conflict\nbetween need for people\nin the team now, but also\nthen with training them\nwe might be into second\nterm before things come\ntogether.\nThe Union needs to look\ninto room bookings; it\u2019s\ncausing stress on staff\nmembers and CSPs, and\nit\u2019s been identified as a\nproblem for a long time.\nAt the moment, the Events\nand Conference team\nfrom College have been\ngoing through the backlog\nof bookings and I believe\nare about caught up \u2013 we\nhave an agreement with\nthem. But it does raise\nfundamental questions\nabout who should be\ndoing it \u2013 do we, with our\ncurrent structure, have the\ncapacity to deliver the\nservice we want to deliver\nto CSPs?\nAdditionally, as part of\nmy role I sit on the Space\nSteering Group (SSG)\nwhich brings in people\nfrom different departments like timetabling\nand IT and is chaired\nby Chris Banks \u2013 who\nis Assistant Provost\n(Space) and Director of\nLibrary Services. Room\nbooking is a topic on\ntheir agenda, as everyone\nwants to book rooms for\nexams and lectures and\nactivities. They\u2019re finally\ngetting to the bottom of it,\nand Chris has been doing\ngoodworkwithherteams,\nputting in place tools that\nadequately address staff\nor student needs.\nThe big issue we have at\nImperial is that everything\nis very modular between\ndepartments and such,\nwhere each one has\nownership of their own\nspace and has their own\nindividual databases for\nbookings. Those are now\nbringing bought together,\nwhich is a huge project\nand has been being\nworked on over two years.\nFelix: So the SSG have\npeople working on\nunifying the databases,\nor are they the \u2018vision\npeople\u2019determining how\nit needs to be done?\nTom: The latter \u2013 it\u2019s\na project management\ngroup. If any projects are\nfalling behind then they\nget flagged and what they\nneed gets discussed (e.g.\nfinances, support.) We\nlook at how new projects\nfit in with ongoing ones,\nhow they fit in the bigger\npicture for different\ndepartments, and improving the use of space\nand space-sharing across\nthe College\u2019s different\ncampuses. The way it\nworks right now ridicu-lous; you have different\nsystems for everything.\nSpace-sharing wise, a lot\nof departments have their\nown rooms and don\u2019t\nwant to share them, but\nobviously it works better\nif someone has a space\nnot being used that\u2019s fit\nfor another\u2019s purpose.\nThe projects are trying to\naddress this problem, this\nisolation of individual\ndepartments, and doing\nso with facts and data \u2013\nthere\u2019s a big piece right\nnow around data collection in terms of space\nusage, on top of merging\nsystems together.\nFelix: You talked\n\n"

My problem\nwith philosophy has\nalways been its irrele-vance, that is, whether\nyou think one way or the\nother has little effect on\nhow the world actually\nplays out. The very core\nof metaphysics lies within\nabstract beliefs and logic\nand is essentially \u201cbeyond\nphysics.\u201d While I see the\nappeal of philosophy,\nits inconsequentiality\nlingers. However, Camus\ntakes a turn when he\ndeems this question the\nmost important, because\nof the definitive act it\nentails, either living for\na purpose or committing\nsuicide for not finding a\nreason to live.\n\u201cAbsurdism\u201d\n\u201cAbsurdism\u201d as defined\nby Camus is the paradox\nbetween one\u2019s urgent need\nfor unity to make sense\nout of this world and the\nworld not making sense.\nCenturies of religion and\nphilosophies have placed\nGod-given meaning as\nthe sole purpose of exist-ence. Taking it to the far\nextreme, when we live for\nour God-given meaning,\nconsider if we are stripped\naway from that meaning,\nis suicide then necessary?\nOne metaphor Camus\noften uses is in a world\ndivested of meaning, a\nman with existentialist\nthoughts may feel in\nexile. He then gives\nsketches of how feelings\nof absurdism may strike,\nat times of weariness\nof mechanical life, the\ninevitability of time, or\nsimply the \u201cdenseness and\nstrangeness of the world.\u201d\nIt is during these moments\nthat our consciousness\nawakes and forces us to\ncontemplate whether life\nhas meaning at all.\nAn absurd reasoning:\nphilosophical suicide\nIt is notable that Camus\nexplores the approach of\nother existentialist philos-ophiesatthetimein-depth,\nincluding Chestov\u2019s and\nKierkegaard\u2019s leap of\nfaith into God in hopes\nof explaining everything\nirrational as well as\nJasper\u2019s and Husserl\u2019s\nquest after transcendence,\nall of which falls into\nthe trap of reconciliation\nsomething entirely irrec-oncilable. Absurdism is\ndefined by the contradictory truths of one\u2019s pursuit\nof meaning and the\nuniverse\u2019s utter silence\non the subject matter. To\napply transcendence on\nit, either through hope or\nblind faith, is to escape\nthe paradox. Clearly,\nCamus is dissatisfied with\nall answers that attempt\nto deny one or the other\npiece of the paradox.\nTherefore the question\nof facing the absurd with\nconsciousness remains.\n\u201cAll of which\nfalls into\nthe trap of\nreconciliation\nsomething\nentirely\nirreconcilable\u201d\nRevolt, freedom, and\npassion\nThe section on absurd\nfreedom, where Camus\nredefines freedom in the\ncontext of absurdity and\narrives at a conclusion on\nhow to live with absurdi-ty, is a personal favourite\nof mine. His definition\nof freedom is essentially\nthe photo-opposite of the\ntraditional philosophical\ndefinition, where one\nhas the choice to decide\non the basis of values\nheld by that particular\nperson. Camus\u2019s version\nessentially disregards the\nvalues, which he claims\nwill form preconceptions\nwhere one ought to follow.\nTo achieve true absurd\nfreedom, one would have\nto abandon those pre-ex-isting expectations and\nlive life as is.\nThis leads us into his\nproposed way to deal\nwith existentialism and\nthe conclusion at which\nhe has arrived--revolt,\nfreedom, and passion. To\nCamus, suicide is merely\nan acceptance of the\nconflict, whereas living\nthe absurd is revolting\nagainst the absurd. With\nthe freedom as defined\nabove, one must also live\npassionately, continue\nchallenging the world,\nliving in the present and\nliving life to the fullest\nwhilst recognising the\nfutility of it all. As Camus\nputs it, \u201cBeing aware of\none\u2019s life, one\u2019s revolt,\none\u2019s freedom, and to the\nmaximum, is living, and to\nthe maximum.\u201d It is rather\ninteresting and delightful\nto see how Camus moves\nfrom existentialism to a\nconclusion that resembles\nthe cliches of many self-help books.\nSketches of the absurd\nman\nIt is no surprise that\nas a womaniser himself\nCamus would choose\nto draw examples from\nthe seductive Don Juan.\nContrary to common\nclaims that he\u2019s after some\ntranscending true love,\nCamus proposes that Don\nJuan simply enjoys the\nexperience of seducing\nand devotes his life doing\nthat and only that, despite\nrecognising its meaning-lessness. One example is\nstage actors embodying\nthis philosophy by living\nout the intensity and\nvariety of life, unburdened by fame and en-deavouring in the fleeting\njoy. Another example he\ngives is the conquerors,\nwho acknowledge that\n\u201caction is in itself useless\u201d\nand is \u201cfully aware of\nthe grandeur.\u201d While\nincluding such sketches\nprovides physical forms\nof innocent, amoral\nbeings fully embracing\nthe absurd, I would\nsay that protagonists in\nCamus\u2019s other works like\nThe Plague better represent Camus\u2019s vision of an\nabsurd man.\nThe Myth of Sisyphus\nThe perfect embodiment of an absurd heroic\nfigure would be Sisyphus,\nwho is punished to roll a\nrock uphill only to watch\nit fall, and repeating that\ntill eternity. Camus is\nespecially interested in\nSisyphus\u2019s consciousness\nat the very moment that\nthe rock rolls down before\nSisyphus continues to\npush the rock up. It is Sisyphus\u2019s state of lucidity\nat the moment that sets\nhim free from his fate.\nAs Camus puts it, \u201cThe\nstruggle itself towards the\nheights is is enough to fill\na man\u2019s heart. One must\nimagine Sisyphus happy.\u201d\nFinal thoughts\nStrictly speaking, The\nMyth of Sisyphus is not a\nwork of philosophy but\nrather Camus\u2019s attempt of\nbuilding a framework on\nhow to live. In this sense,\nit is not peculiar that he\nhas arrived at the conclusion that he did. Although\nhe left many questions\nunanswered, his response\nis certainly a pragmatic\nanswer to the continual\nsearch for meaning. I\nlike that Camus himself\nfully embodies his own\nphilosophy of the ironic\nblend of detachment and\npassionate-living, and\nthat is perhaps the best a\nphilosopher can do.\n\n"

Despite its\nsomewhat peculiar plot,\nthe play has proven surprisingly timeless through\nthe ages. There are at\nleast five new stagings of\nit this year alone - one of\nwhich is Jamie Lloyd\u2019s\nupcoming production at\nthe Playhouse Theatre.\nFelix Arts interviews\nAnita-Joy Uwajeh, who\nhas been cast as Roxane,\non the remaking of this\n19th century play.\nFelix: How would you\nroughly describe the\nplay?\nAJU: Traditionally it\u2019s\nknown as a play about a\nman with an incredibly\nlarge nose which is\nperhaps some kind of\ndeformity for him. This\nprevents him from getting\nthe woman he loves\nbecause she is in love with\nthe beautiful Christian,\nwho she believes to be a\ngreat writer when in fact\nit\u2019s Cyrano.With all of that\nin mind, for me the play\nis really about love and\ninsecurity and a longing\nfor an intimate connection\nthat looks beyond one\u2019s\nexterior image.\nFelix: Why is now the\nright time to bring\nCyrano de Bergerac\nback to the London\nstages?\nAJU: With regards to\nthe production we are\ntrying to create, it is a\nvery modern outlook to\nthis classic play. I think\nit\u2019s vital now because it\u2019s\na universal story that a\nlot of us are dealing with\nregardless of what era we\nare in.\nFelix: You play Roxane, who is the primary love interest for\nvarious characters\nwithin the play. On a\ndeeper level, though,\nwho is Roxane?\nAJU: Roxane is a young\nwoman in a man\u2019s world\nwho is trying desperately\nto reach others with her\nmind and language and\nmakethemunderstandthat\nbeauty is not everything.\nHowever, she herself falls\nvictim to being distracted\nby Christian\u2019s beauty.\nWhich makes her a very\nreal, flawed character and\nthat\u2019s exciting to play.\nFelix: What drew you\nto be a part of this\nproduction as this\nspecific character?\nAJU: The opportunity to\nwork with Jamie Lloyd\nand James McAvoy. I\nalso love Martin Crimp\u2019s\nwriting and I am excited\nabout that. In addition,\nwhen I read the play and\nprepped for my auditions\neach time I found myself\nuncovering another layer\nto Roxane and the play.\nWhat do you hope\nto bring to the character through your\nportrayal of Roxane?\nAJU: I hope to bring to\nlife a fully fleshed out\nwoman that audiences can\nconnect to.\nFelix: How similar is\nyour own character\nto that of Roxane?\nAJU: I would say Roxane\nis similar and different in\na way to me. She\u2019s quite\nsharp tongued at times\nwhich is similar to me.\nBut she thinks a lot faster\nthan myself when it comes\nto finding a witty solution\nfor a particular problem.\nFelix: The details of\nthis production have\nlargely been kept out\nof the spotlight - are\nthere any surprises\nwe can look forward\nto?\nAJU: It wouldn\u2019t be a\nsurprise if I told you :)\nFelix: The is not the\nfirst English adaptation of the play. What\ndo you think makes it\nspecial?\nAJU: Well I believe it has\nbeen translated directly\nfrom the French. I would\nalso say it\u2019s got a very\nparticular style.\nFelix: Is there anything specific that\nyou hope the audience globally take\naway from seeing\nthis production?\nAJU: I hope that the\naudience globally can feel\ninspired to not be held\nback by their own \u2018big\nnose\u2019 aka insecurity and\ngo for what they desire.\nFelix: You have an extensive background\nin both TV and the\nsilver screen. However, your roots seem\nto be strongly within\nthe theatre. What\nmakes you keep\ncoming back to the\ntheatre, and the West\nEnd specifically?\nAJU: I love that fact that\nevery night is different\nfor both the actor and\naudience. And that each\naudience member gets\ntheir very own experience\nin the theatre even if they\nare watching the same\nplay and I love being a\npart of that.\nFelix: Theatre has a\nreputation for being inaccessible for\nmany. The initiative\nto release 15,000\ntickets for free, and\nanother 15,000 for\n\u00a315 is definitely a\nstep in the right\ndirection - what else\ndo you think can be\ndone to allow more\npeople to enjoy the-atre?\nAJU: I think encouraging\nit with schools more and\nlocal communities will\nreally help broaden the\ndemographic that goes to\ntheatre.\nFelix: What advice\ndo you have for the\nstudent actors, directors and the crew\nwho spend their time\noutside of their studies to put on these\nproductions?\nAJU: Whatever work you\nare putting on should be\nproduced from a place of\nlove and enjoyment.\nFelix: What are some\nof your favourite productions in London\nand where do you\nrecommend a theatre\nnovice starts with the\nLondon scene?\nAJU: I loved The Inheritance when it was on and\na play called The Royale\nat The Bush a few years\nago. The Young Vic is\na great place to start or\nGlobe Theatre or Arcola\nor The Bush.\nFelix: Have you had\nany crazy stage door\nexperiences?\nAJU: Don\u2019t know if this\nis a crazy stage door\nstory but when I was\nworking at the Globe I\nhad an audience member\ncompletely fan-out at me\nin foyer. It was very sweet\nand I was glad she enjoyed\nthe show but it was a little\nintense for me at the time.\n------In support of broadening\naccess to theatre, the\nJamie Lloyd Company\nis offering 15,000 \u00a315\ntickets across the season\nfor under 30s. Tickets\nfor Cyrano de Bergerac\nwere released on 4th\nNovember.

Mary\u2019s, the\nUniversity of Mo Farah\nand a National Lottery\nfunded British Athletics\nProgram, was going to\nbe a tough opponent to\nsquash. In the first fixture,\nthe two titanic forces of\nImperial and Mary\u2019s cancelled each-other out by\ngoing 2 - 1 and 1 - 2 in the\nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s team\nraces respectively.\nWith a strong Imperial\nteam turning up in the\ncold fields of Mitcham\nCommon, the athletes\nwere quietly confident of\na dominant performance\nover the Mary\u2019s crowd.\nLater in the day, after\nthe dust had settled on a\nferocious battle in South\nLondon, they all eagerly\nawaited the team results\nas the brilliant individual\nperformances became\napparent; Georgia Curry\nled by example to take\nGold in the women\u2019s\nrace, a performance\nthat puts her top of the\noverall rankings ahead\nof super-fresher Laura\nWright, who claimed the\nBronze. This was on the\nback of Laura winning the\nU20\u2019s Liddiard XC title at\nthe weekend. The strong\nperformances from Chloe\nBaker (6th) and Alix\nVermeulen (8th) mean\nthat Imperial hold places\n1, 2, 4 and 6 in the overall\nindividual women\u2019s com-petition.\nOn the men\u2019s side,\nOllie Barbaresi, keen to\noverturn a stinging defeat\nat the hands of Mary\u2019s\u2019\nTom Butler, beat his foe\nthis time around to take\nthe Silver medal behind\nMary\u2019s\u2019 Dan Jarvis.

This allows students to use pictures and\nvideo to note changes, as\nwell as having a lab book\nthat follows them between\nlab cycles.\nSimone also said that\nher initial reaction was\nexcitement, and, most of\nall, faith in innovators. \u201cIt\nwas a really well thought-out proposal, and some\nof our top professors like\nAlan Spivey and Roger\nKneebone were involved\nin that.

They organised the\nweekly sessions \u2013 three a\nmonth in South Kensington and one in White City\n\u2013 as a response, which\nbegan in August during\nthe resit examinations\nand launched fully during\nWelcome Week.\nSessions last around\nfifteen minutes with up\nto four students, meaning\nRoxy usually sees up to\n50 students each time she\nvisits.

As opposed to\na reasonable point by\npoint refutation of\nmy own argument,\nthe author relies on a\nsense of overwhelming\npersonal outrage. Unfortunately, anger does\nnot make an argument.\nThe overriding theme\nof the article is that I\nhave overstepped the\nbounds of free speech\nby criticising China as\noppressive and mocking\nXi Jinping. Furthermore,\nthe article attempts to\nclarify the errors in\nWestern attitudes with\nregards to China.

To be\ncompletely clear, the\nChinese government\nis oppressive. It is currently in the process of\ninterring an entire ethnic\ngroup in re-education\ncamps. It is still widely\nsuspected of extracting\norgans from its executed\npolitical prisoners,\ndespite claiming that it\nended this practice a few\nyears ago. It prevents\naccess to the external\ninternet using a Great\nFirewall and provides\ninstead an extensively\nmonitored and censored\nalternative. This has\nbeen used to control the\nflow of information into\nChina as well as erasing\nmemories of past\nevents, such as a certain\nmassacre that definitely\ndidn\u2019t happen in 1989.\nThere are almost countless examples of the\nChinese government\npreventing those that\nlive within its borders\nfrom exercising various\nhuman rights, including\nthe right to free speech,\nthrough insidious and\nviolent state coercion.\nTo a certain extent,\nthe Chinese government\nis perfectly within its\nrights to operate in\nthis manner. It is an\nindependent sovereign\nstate with a government\nthat certainly appears to\nhave the support of the\nmasses of China. In the\nlast few decades, the\nChinese system of government has overseen\nrapid economic growth\nand the uplifting of\nmany millions from\npoverty. The issue arises\nwhen China attempts\nto extend censorship\nof Chinese government\ncensorship to other sovereign states, such as the\nUK, in an effort to stem\ninternational criticism.\nThis can manifest itself\nin attempts to regulate\nforeign discussion of\nHong Kong by applying\neconomic pressure to\ncompanies that operate\nwithin China. Or it could\ninvolve attempting to\nshut down mockery\ndirected at Xi Jinping\neven though this type of\ncommentary is entirely\nwithin the laws of the\nUK.\nSome Chinese nationals are certainly considered to have a part\nto play in this strategy.\nAt the University of\nQueensland, Australia,\nclashes were sparked\nwhen pro-Beijing coun-ter-protesters ripped\nup protest signs from\na peaceful pro-Hong\nKong demonstration.\nOnly last week, new\nmorality guidelines were\nissued by the Chinese\ngovernment instructing\nChinese citizens to\ndefend China\u2019s honor\nwhen travelling abroad.\nAlthough I am absolutely not accusing the\nagain\n3. (Optional) A PDF is\nattached in response to\nthis article and I would\nlike it posted on school\nnewspaper. If any moderation is necessary for\nit to be posted, please\ntell me.\nUnfortunately, I will\nnot offer an apology. I\nwill also not promise\nto not write about or\ndeliberately insult\nChina again. Neither\nwill the Editor-in-Chief\napologise on behalf of\nFelix, and Felix will\ncontinue to cover stories\nor opinions about China\n(in Politics or Comment\nrespectively).\nWhat we will do is\nwhat we have always\ndone: offer a platform to\nanyone that would use it\nto inform the rest of the\nstudents at the University of your opinion under\nthe proper operation\nof Freedom of Speech\nin the UK. Anyone can\nwrite for us and they\nwill be published, providing we\u2019re not bored\nof the topic as we hope\nwe\u2019ve shown today. Just\nbe coherent next time.\nOn a personal note,\nI am rather delighted\nby the response. It is\nnot very often that it\nis demanded of one to\napologise to the entire\nnation of China. I was\nworried that I had lost\nthe ability to piss people\noff. I shall leave you,\ndear reader, with this:\nFree Tibet, Taiwan\nNumber One, Glory\nto Hong Kong. And of\ncourse, make Xi Jinping\nWinnie the Pooh again.\nThe hairy honey bear himself // Wikimedia\n\u201cNew morality\nguidelines\nwere issued\ninstructing\nChinese\ncitizens to\ndefend China\u2019s\nhonour\nabroad\u201d\nauthor of acting on\nbehalf of his govern-ment, this article would\nsurely please the CCP\nback in Beijing.\nThe author sent\nFelix the following list\nof demands, copied\nverbatim from the email:\n1.

This prompted an\noutpouring across social\nmedia which mainly consisted of has-been emos\nthis\u201d. Elsewhere, Rage\nAgainst the Machine also\nannounced their reunion\nquietly on social media\nwith a string a tour dates\nfor next year including a\nheadline slot at Coachella.\nIn the wake of this, the politically charged rap metal\nband have had to disband\ntheir supergroup Prophets\nof Rage formed alongside\nmembers of Cypress Hill\nand Chuck D. All of this\ncame after guitarist Tom\nMorello specifically said\nto not \u201cwait around for\nRage Against the Machine\n\u2013 form your own band\nand get it done\u201d.

I thought I would\nshare some of these with\nyou, reader.\n1. Mark Kavuma \u2013\nLullaby to a Fading Star.\nThis sensuous slow burner\nhas all the trappings of a\n60s outing, surprisingly\nhowever, it came out\nearlier this year on The\nBanger Factory - a strong\nrecord showcasing some\nof London\u2019s rising stars.\nBuilt around a delicate,\nclassic jazz progression,\ndelivered by the vibraphone\u2019s pillowish tones .\nYawning, rich harmonies\nand subtle solos fill out\nthis instrumental, with a\nHammond organ bubbling\naway in the background.\nLullaby to a fading star\nwill practically lull you to\nsleep.\n2. Grouper \u2013 Vapor\nTrails. Grouper is an\nindie artist who specialises in tracks more\natmosphere than song.\nA monastic figure, she\nhid behind mountains of\nequipment and ran off\nstage immediately after\nthe performance\u2019s end\nwhen I caught live her\nlast autumn. On \u2018Vapour\ntrails\u2019keyboard and guitar,\nobscured by miasmas of\nreverb build a dense sense\nof tranquillity, sweetened\nslightly by Grouper\u2019s\nvocal harmonies, this\ntrack will take you to the\nmoon.\n3. Bill Evans, Jim\nHall \u2013 Romain .When it\ncomes to relaxing music\nBill Evans is the pianist.\nThis laid-back outing\nfeatures only piano and\npristine guitar courtesy of\nJim hall. The track builds\nits backbone around a\nmenacing head before\ndelving into delightfully\norchestrated solos from\nboth Evans and Hall, a\nslow, rich, and satisfying\nperformance from a wonderful record.\n4. Linda Perhacs \u2013\nChimacum rain.. Linda\nPerhacs released one\nrecord Parallelograms in\n1970, a singer songwriter\ncollection drawing heavily\nfrom the folk tradition,\nbefore disappearing back\nto a quiet life. What makes\nher stand out are her delightful vocal harmonies.\nChimacum rain is perhaps\nthe best example of this,\nher half-whispered vocals\ndelicately blossoming into\na cradling chorus, over\ngentle acoustic arpeggios.\n5. Christian Scott\naTunde Adjuah \u2013 Videotape. Christian Scott\nis a jazz trumpeter with\na unique \u201cWhisper\ntechnique\u201d, creating\nbreathy atmospheres by\nmulti tracking his gentle\ntrumpet tone.

Just saying all of that\nwas a mouthful. I haven\u2019t\neven picked up my fork\nyet.\nBlack Milk goes\nagainst the grain by\npresenting their shakes\na bit differently. Most\nplaces have a theirs come\nin little mason jars. It\u2019s a\ncute aesthetic that gives\nthe perfect sized rim for\nthe toppings like donuts\nfor sure but sometimes I\nwant to more. Black Milk\nuse tall glasses that make\ntheirs shakes really stand\nout amongst their peers.\nThat also mean that their\nshakes need a bit more\nhelp standing tall. They\nused a wooden stick to\nhold the slice in place. It\u2019s\nuseful but many people\naround us ended up asking\nfor a plate to put their\nslice on. The magic of\nthe freakshake disappears\nif you can\u2019t manage to\nactually eat it for fear of it\nall toppling over.\nI decided to power\nthrough and start from\nthe very top.. The things\nI do for Felix. The salted\ncaramel cake was moist\nand decadent. As salted\nyou can get started on\nthe actual milkshake. The\ndrink was smooth and\ncreamy. It was incredibly\nindulgent though I wish\nthe biscoff taste was more\nobvious. Biscoff and\nsalted caramel are truly a\nmatch made in heaven \u2013 I\nrealise that now. Name a\nmore iconic duo, I\u2019ll wait.\nThey also decorate the\ncup with extra biscoff and\nhave chocolate around the\nrim if you have it in you\nfor more.\nThe caf\u00e9 is situated in\nthe corner of the Fiorucci\nstore in Covent Garden\nbut with freakshakes like\nthis, they definitely make\ntheir presence known.\nThey\u2019ve got other treats\nlike their slightly less\nintense Black Milkshakes\nwaffles of cereal cocktail\nbowls. Everything is halal\nexcept the lucky charms\nbecause of their marsh-mallows. Their staff are\ngreat to so you can have\na lovely conversation\nwhile they are creating the\nmasterpiece. You eat on\nthe backdrop of the latest\nfashion in the store so\nmake sure you don\u2019t get\ntoo messy! I made sure I\nstayed as far away from\nthem as I could because I\ndon\u2019t trust myself. I wish\nthey had a proper place in\nLondon or at least in an\narea where some stray ice\ncream doesn\u2019t become a\nvery expensive mistake.\nWhen you visit, have\nyour camera ready. They\nvalue customers photos to\nthe point that their entire\nInstagram is comprised\nof them. They will even\nreward you for the perfect\nshot. A repost to their\nstory will get you 50% off\nyour next milkshake while\na repost to their page gets\nyou one for free so you\ncould be back for more in\nno time.\nThe sugar dream\ndoesn\u2019t have to stop when\nyou step out the door. If\nyou want to take the magic\nhome, you can buy their\nKinderella Cream online.\nYes, they\u2019ve managed to\nget the taste of the Kinder\nBueno cream and put it\nin a jar. They\u2019ve also got\na sticky toffee, salted\ncaramel and biscoff sauce\nif that\u2019s what you are\nreally looking for to make\nyour own sweet creations.\nThere are some that are\nfinding all of this to be\nway too sickly. This is a\nlot of sugar \u2013 I can\u2019t deny\nthat. A sweet tooth was\nrequired to get through\nthe mountain that was put\nin front of me. There is no\ndoubt that this is exces-sive. Does it make sense?\nNo. Are there better meals\nyou could be having? Yes.\nBut there is simply such\nan appeal of eating things\nfor the spectacle of it all.\nAnd these cavities-in-a-cup truly have that wow\nfactor to them. So, if\nyou ever find yourself in\nCovent Garden, looking\nto put yourself through\nthe biggest sugar high of\nyour life, this is the best\nplace to hit up.\nSalted Caramel Stack, for those wanting an extra slice to their shake // Zahra Abiola\nAn Oreo milkshake that will have you melting just like the cream // Zahra Abiola\n\u201cBlack Milk\ngoes against\nthe grain by\npresenting\ntheir shakes a\nbit differently\u201d\n\u201cRanging\nfrom whipped\ncream and\nsprinkles to\nhaving burgers\nbalancing\ndangerously\nclose to your\ndrink on a\nstick\u201d\ncaramel is one of my\nfavourite flavours, I have\nsome very strong opinions\non the stuff. I always have\na problem with places\nserving salted caramel\ndesserts that just taste\nsweet. The salt should be\npresent enough to make\nthe caramel taste become\nsharper and more present.\nI can happily say that this\ncake definitely delivered\nin that aspect, especially\nwhen it came to the icing\nseparating the layers. We\nwere off to a good start.\nIf you still have space\nonce the cake is gone,\n\n"

    "content": "5 Steps To Improve Your Emotional Intelligence\nE\nm o t i o n a l\nIntelligence is\nthe one life skill\nthat many great\nleaders possess. Someone\nwith a high emotional IQ\ncan navigate the waters\nof all life situations.\nEmotional intelligence is\nthe ability to manage your\nemotions as well as those\naround you. People often\nforget how important their\nemotional IQ is. Some\nof us, undervalue it, we\nfocus on other things, or\nwe figure that it\u2019s not that\nimportant. But it is! It\u2019s\nvery important to develop\nand grow your emotional\nIQ.\nThe best way to grow\nyour emotional IQ is to\ndo so gradually. Slow deliberate changes is a great\nmethod to bring about\nlasting changes in your\nlife. Focusing on areas of\nyour emotional IQ that can\nbe improved takes time\nand diligence. That\u2019s why\nit\u2019s important to practice\nemotional awareness all\nthe time, not just when we\nthink something is already\nwrong.\nHere are some ways\nyou can improve your\nemotional IQ.\nFirst Ask Yourself How\nYou Are Feeling\nBeing aware of our\nown emotions can be\nvery similar to being\naware of other people\u2019s\nemotions. Doing so you\ncan avoid stressful situation by evaluating your\nfeelings before you react.\nChecking your own emotional wellness is done the\nsame way you the check\nemotional wellness of\nothers: by asking.\nWhen other people ask\nyou how you are doing, it\ncan be most efficient and\npolite to just say \u201cokay\u201d\nor \u201cfine\u201d but if you literally ask yourself you may\nreply with something a\nlittle more informative.\nYou don\u2019t have to carry\non a whole conversation\nwith yourself, but if you\nask yourself \u201cHow are\nyou doing?\u201d and you\nrespond with \u201cWell, I\u2019ve\nbeen better,\u201d it might be\nsomething to spend more\ntime thinking about.\nSecond, become comfortable talking about\nyour own feelings\nSo many people find\nit hard to talk about their\nfeelings. But verbalizing\nhow you\u2019re feeling is\none the best ways to\nevaluate your emotional\nIQ. Consider stating how\nyou feel with statements\nlike \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable\nwith,\u201d or \u201cthat makes me\nfrustrated.\u201d This method\nof expressing your own\nfeelings will help you\nfocus and think more\nabout how you feel and\nhow you react to things,\nbut it also will help other\npeople to understand how\nyou are feeling.\nfocused on everything but\nthe present. Practicing\nMany people are\nreluctant to get into meditation because it often has\nreligious connotations.\nWhile the oldest forms of\nmeditation are explicitly\nreligious, more modern\nforms of meditation focus\nexclusively on the secular\nbenefits of meditation.\nRelated to but slightly different from mindfulness,\nmediation involves taking\na part of the day, as little\nas a few minutes, to clear\nyour mind.\nClearing your mind can\nbring its own benefits,\nalthough it is very diffi-cult. Recognizing what\nthoughts or feelings make\nit difficult to clear your\nmind can help you to\nrecognize which things in\nyour life are giving you\nthe most trouble.\nAs was the case with\nmindfulness, there are\na lot of great resources\nonline regarding medi-tation, but the best place\nto start may be a friendly\nconversation with your\nprimary care provider.\nFinally, you can write as\na method to increase\nyour emotional intelli-gence.\nMany people who\njournal find it helpful\nto express themselves\nprivately. Writing can be\nvery therapeutic. You can\nwrite daily, or when you\nneed to express yourself.\nDocumenting your experiences can be a tool to see\nareas of growth in your\nlife. Writing can help you\nto express your feelings\nin a safe and healthy way\nbut re-reading your own\nwork can also help you to\nsee your own experiences\nfrom a new perspective.\nThis can help you to\nunderstand your feelings\nand can allow you to\nidentify creative solutions\nto your problems.\nPOSTGRADUATE\nSara Hendricks\nGraduate Felix Officer\nISSUE 1733\nFELIX\nPOSTGRADUATE gsu.president@imperial.ac.uk\nIt\u2019s important to keep\nfocused on the topic and\ntry not to get distracted.\nWhen your \u201cI\u2019s\u201d get\ntoo close together it can\nbecome rude, but it may\nalso distort your outlook.\nThird Practice Mindfulness\nThe practice of mindfulness will encourage\nyou to be aware of your\nthoughts and feelings, as\nwell as how they make\nyou feel physically. Your\nbody can become tense,\nyour muscles tighten,\nand you start breathing\nrapidly. Mindfulness exercises that focus on your\nbreath and breathing are a\ngreat way to relieve stress\nand get you back on track.\nAnother key attribute\nof mindfulness is being\naware of your current state\nof mind. Staying present\nis a great way to control\nyour emotions. Often\npeople find themselves\n\u201cIt\u2019s important\nto practice\nemotional\nawareness\nall the time,\nnot just when\nwe think\nsomething is\nalready wrong\u201d\nMeditation can help with matters of the mind// Mindful\n\u201cEmotional\nintelligence is\nthe ability to\nmanage your\nemotions as\nwell as those\naround you\u201d\nImproving your emotional IQ, through emotional awareness will benefit both your personal and professional\nlife.

This\nprovides many explanations as to why we are\nfacing elections only six\nmonths after the last cycle\nin April; one of these\nrelates to the fact that\nthe increasing quantity\nof parties is not matched\nby a growing number of\neffective politicians.\nAfter Francisco\nFranco\u2019s dictatorship in\n1975, a two-party system\nvery much dominated\nSpain\u2019s new democratic\ngovernment, with the\nPeople\u2019s Party (right\nwing) and the Socialist\nWorker\u2019s Party (left wing)\nalternating in power over\nthe years. This relative\nstability was overturned\nin the last decade when\nnumerous corruption\ncases within the government arose, and a general\ndiscontent of Spanish\npeople with the government led two new political\nparties to gain traction,\nCiudadanos (centre-right)\nand Podemos (left wing),\ncausing the Congress of\nDeputies to transition\nfrom a bipartisan to a\ntetra-partisan landscape.\nSince then, no party\nhas been able to win a\nmajority of the vote, nor\nhave any been able to\nbuild coalitions to form\na working government,\nwhich led to the dissolution of Congress and\nthe convocation of a new\ngeneral election in July\n2016. These elections\nresulted in Mariano Rajoy\nof the People\u2019s Party\nbecoming the President\nof Spain, thanks to the\nformation of a coalition\nwith Ciudadanos and\nthe abstention of the\nWorker\u2019s Party. Yet, in\nJuly of 2018, there was\na vote of no confidence\nagainst the government\nand Pedro Sanchez - from\nthe Worker\u2019s party \u2013\nbecame the new president\nof Spain. Last April,\nnew general elections\nwere held yet again as\nthe Spanish Congress\ninstability and ineffi-ciency. Since the 2016\nelections, negotiations\nand horse-trading that\narose from attempts to\nbuild coalitions led to a\nbroken government that\nwas focused on solving\ninternal party problems\nthan actual nationwide\nissues.\nOne could argue that a\nmultiparty system could\nbe an improvement for\nSpanish politics. When\nsmaller parties are forced\nto form coalitions, they are\nforced to move towards a\nmiddle ground in order\nto maintain power, which\nis better than any fanaticism when governing a\ncountry. As the Spanish\nA general election has been called for 10th November, the second in six months and the fourth in four years\nPedro Sanchez, the current Spanish Prime Minister// Wikimedia\nFRIDAY, 8TH NOVEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nPOLITICS\nMaeve Johnston\nPolitics Writer\nex-president Adolfo\nSuarez said about Spain\u2019s\ncurrent situation, \u201cwhat\nat street level is simply\nnormal, has been elevated\nto the political category of\nnormal\u201d; there is a better\nrepresentation, response,\nand articulation of the\nviews of all voters these\ndays than there was 40\nyears ago, brought on by\nsmaller parties that have\nbeen forced to respond to\npopular preferences rather\nthan particular interests.\nYet, it is apparent that\nthe Spanish multiparty\nsystem has become a\nchallenge. Indecisive\npoliticians have focused\nmore on solving issues\nwithin their party than\non solving national and\nsocial issues, ranging\nfrom unemployment to\ncorruption, as well as the\ncurrent situation in Catalonia.

Spain\u2019s recent\npolitical instability and inefficiency did not arise by\nchance, but is caused by\nthe increasing number of\nsmaller parties competing\nfor a divided electorate,\nand the mediocre politicians leading them.\nIn the upcoming elec-tions, a new left-wing\nparty (M\u00e1s Pais, led by\n\u201cThe Spanish\npolitical\nlandscape\nhas been\ndramatically\nreshaped by\nnew, younger\npoliticians\nand smaller\nparties\u201c\nrefused to support the\nState\u2019s General Budgets,\nwith a new party entering\nthe scene: Vox, a rightwing populist party.\nThe votes became even\nmore contested over and\nhistory repeated itself: the\ndifferent parties were not\nable to agree and establish\na government, requiring\nelections to take place\nagain in a few days.\nThe transition from a\nbipartisan to a multiparty\nsystem has led to political\nI\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n) will be\nentering the race, joining\nfive original candidates\nto become the sixth party\ncompeting for the presi-dency. While polls predict\na similar result for this\nupcoming election, hope\nstill remains that after the\n10th of November they\nwill be able to do their job\nand form a government\nthat is very much needed\nto face domestic problems\nlike high unemployment,\nand international ones like\nTrump\u2019s tariffs on Spanish\nproducts and the infamous\nBrexit.\n\n"

Perhaps this explains\nwhy the \ufb01lmwas so widely\nacclaimed at independent\n\ufb01lm festivals, winning\nthe Grand Jury Prize at\nSundance, but what may\nbe relatable and touching\nto people from the \ufb01lm\nindustry, seems rather dull\nto an ordinary \ufb01lmgoer.\nThe feature is essentially\none two-hour-long chat:\nthere are conversations\nat the table, discussions\nin the car, there is pillow\ntalk and deep-meaning-ful-conversations at a\nparty. However, to fully\nengage in these we would\nhave to know the backstory of the main characters.\nWithout it The Souvenir\nfeels like an arbitrary\ncollection of scenes and\nquotes from other \ufb01lms.\nTo be clear, the \ufb01lm\ndoes touch on complex\nissues \u2013 growing up and\ngaining independence\nfrom one\u2019s family, drug\naddiction, being honest\nwith oneself \u2013 but does\nso in a super\ufb01cial manner,\nthen wanders off to\nanother topic without\njustifying characters\u2019\nactions. The fact that The\nSouvenir was shot without\na script, only based on a\nshort summary of Hogg\u2019s\nto hesitate between protecting Julie and giving\nher space for her own\ndecisions. She was stunningly portrayed by Tilda\nSwinton, actual mother\nof Honor Swinton Byrne,\nwho played Julie in a\nnatural, charming way.\nTom Burke also gave an\ninteresting performance\nas Anthony, an enigmatic\nman, who slowly unfolds\nto show his toxic person-ality.\nOne of the biggest\nstrengths of the \ufb01lm,\nin my opinion, was the\ncamerawork. The story\nwas \ufb01lmed with attention\nto composition, while\nlight and shadow give it\nan intimate atmosphere.\nThe choice of soundtrack,\ntogether with blurry,\ngrainy images de\ufb01nitely\nadds to the nostalgic feel.\nThere is something fascinating about how quiet\nand minimalistic this \ufb01lm\nis. Nevertheless, the story\nis too vague and personal\nto be truly engaging.\nYour Father\u2019s Murderer: A Letter to Zachary\nS\nometimes it\u2019s nice\nto just have a good\ncry at a movie,\ncathartic even;\nso with a quick Google\nfor some of the saddest\n\ufb01lms ever made, followed\nby a little scrolling on\nReddit, I came across this\nrecommendation from\nUbertraquer with the bold\nwords \u201cwithout a doubt\nthe most tragic and heart\nwrenching \ufb01lm\u201d.\nThis documentary\nfollows \ufb01lmmaker Kurt\nKuenne as he writes\na \u2018letter\u2019 to Zachary,\ndetailing the life of his\nmurdered father (Andrew\nBagby), and the people\nhe surrounded himself\nwith. With the promise\nof being tragic, I was set\nwith a box of tissues and\na Hall and Oates album on\nstandby if things became a\nlittle too much, yet I found\nsomething lacking.\nI won\u2019t spoil it, but if I\nwere to tell you the entire\nstory of Andrew Bagby,\nI\u2019m sure I might elicit a\ntear or two, but watching\nthis \ufb01lm I couldn\u2019t quite\nbring myself to squeeze\none out, so what stopped\nthese tears from \ufb02owing\nhere?\nI\u2019m not one to shy away\nfrom crying in a \ufb01lm. I\nmean you\u2019re listening to\nsomeone who cried at\nthe end of Toy Story 3,\nso I was expecting to be\nthis documentary felt\nquite different. Where\nKuenne could\u2019ve have\neasily turned this into a\nsob fest, playing on every\nemotional trigger known,\nhe simply didn\u2019t. Instead\nof focusing entirely on the\nbad, most of this \ufb01lm felt\nlike a celebration of the\nlife of Andrew, focusing\non the lives of others he\ntouched; this is made\nalmost over abundantly\nclear at the beginning as\nwe see something being\ndropped into a pond with\nthe ripples of the water\nspilling out. This isn\u2019t the\nonly trope throughout the\nmovie though - littered\nwith record scratches\nand choppy editing,\nthis feels like a very\n\u2018homely\u2019 movie, giving a\nmuch more intimate and\npersonal feel to it. While\nsome might argue this is\npoor \ufb01lmmaking, it feels\nvery much in the \u2018spirit\u2019\nof what this \ufb01lm is trying\nto achieve.\nThis is an extremely\npersonal \ufb01lm, and while\nwatching it I couldn\u2019t\nescape the feeling that I\nwas intruding. This is not\na \ufb01lm for a boy across the\nAtlantic to be watching\nslouched in bed, it simply\ndoesn\u2019t do it justice. This\nwas a \ufb01lm made for the\npeople that knew Andrew,\nand while it has many\n\ufb02aws, it tells an honest\nstory about a tragic time\nin these peoples lives, and\nyou can\u2019t help but admire\nit for that.\nOur two lead characters in The Souvenir// A24\nFILM\nZuzanna Janusz\nFilm Writer\nDir: Joanna Hogg.

In\ngroups of fifteen at a\ntime, students spend\nthree hours a day for\nthree days in a newly\nrenovated kitchen space\nin the Sir Ernst Chain\nBuilding, working on\nlab skills in a relaxed\natmosphere, wearing\naprons instead of lab\ncoats, and working with\nfood instead of synthetic\nchemicals.\nIn assigned groups of\nthree, students follow a\nsimple protocol to make\ncheese or tofu using\ncoagulating agents and\nfiltration on the first day,\nmake a plated dish using\nmolecular gastronomy ingredients such as xanthan\ngum and alginate to create\ngarnishes. Throughout\nthe process they practice\nskills such as measuring\nand recording observations or calculating yields,\nuse chemical glassware\nand apparatus, and learn\nmolecular gastronomy\ntechniques like spheri-fication. But they also\nhave the chance to funnel\ncreativity into the dish\nthey choose to create on\nthe last day, so that no\ntwo groups end up with\nidentical plates.\n\u201cWhether you want to\nbe a chemist or a chef,\nskills such as meticulous\nplanning and detailed\nobservation and recording are vital,\u201d said Alan\nSpivey, Assistant Provost\n(Learning & Teaching).\nThis was the key inspiration for the course: taking\nadvantage of the overlapping skills between\nworking in a kitchen\nand a laboratory to teach\nstudents the soft skills\ninvolved in chemistry.\nStudents coming into\nImperial have varying\nlevels of lab experience\nand confidence in lab\nwork. Chemical Kitchen\naims to level the playing\nfield by providing an opportunity for all students\nto familiarise themselves\nwith the \u2018thinking and\ndoing\u2019 involved in experi-ments, under the guise of a\nkitchen environment. The\nfocus isn\u2019t about the exact\ntechnical skills involved,\nbut rather students\u2019deeper\nappreciation of why things\nare done the way they are\ndone. In this unpressured\nenvironment, students\ncome to understand why\ntheir workspace in labs\nshould be kept tidy, how to\ntake lab notes throughout\nthe experiment and what\nto record, why instructions should be followed\nclosely, how to manage\ntheir time, and more. With\nfood, there is an immediate visible impact of their\nactions on the results.\nChemical Kitchen isn\u2019t\njust a standalone part of\nthe course. The skills\ntaught are relevant to\nthe chemistry education\nthe department wants\nto deliver, in that the\nexperience of creating\nsomething in the kitchen\nbears resemblance to the\nsynthetic chemistry labs\nstudents will eventually\ndo. Accordingly, the three\ndays spent at Chemical\nKitchen are followed by\ntwo days of the very first\nsynthetic chemistry labs\nfor Y1 students. Whilst\nstudents receive feedback\non the lab notes the\nproduce during Chemical\nKitchen, their first sum-mative assessment on lab\nnotes will be from the\nsynthetic chemistry labs\nthat follow. This is an approach embraced during\nthe chemistry curriculum\nreview \u2013 that students\nshould receive feedback\non a task before being\nassessed on it.\nRecrystallisation using\na Buchner funnel is one\nsuch technique that students will come across\nmultiple times in synthetic chemistry labs, but may\nhave their first encounter\nwith through Chemical\nKitchen.\nThe idea for the course\nwas born out of the recognition that the skills an\nundergraduate chemist\nshould have overlap with\nthe skills a chef may have.\nOne of the people who\nrecognised this was Jozef\nYoussef, Chef Patron\nand founder of Kitchen\nTheory, a multisensory\ndesign studio which\n(among other activities)\ninvestigates how our\nsenses detect factors like\ncolour and symmetry to\ninfluence our enjoyment\nof food. He helped to\ndevelop the recipes used\nin the lab. From Imperial,\nProfessor Roger Kneebone from the Imperial\nCollege Centre for Engagement and Simulation\nScience, Assistant Provost\nProfessor Alan Spivey,\nTeaching Fellow Dr Luke\nDelmas, and Culinary\nEducation Designer Dr\nJakub Radzikowski\nhelped to push through the\ncourse\u2019s implementation\nunder the umbrella of the\ncurriculum review.\nIn particular, Luke and\nJakub spent the summer\ncarefully designing the\nactivities such that they\nsuccessfully deliver the\nlearning outcomes they\nhad in mind: for students\nto practice meticulous\ntechniques, plan and\nperform simple exper-iments, and more. As\nthey explain it, \u201cit\u2019s the\nsame chemistry skills but\nputting a different kind of\nface on it \u2013 so they don\u2019t\nfeel like they have to be\nexperts. A student may\nbe happy saying \u2018I\u2019m\nnot good at cooking\u2019,\nbut saying \u2018I\u2019m not good\nat chemistry\u2019 probably\nleaves them feeling more\nvulnerable. Chemical\nKitchen is serious but not\nserious chemistry, so we\nthink that students would\nfeel more comfortable and\nconfident.\u201d\nThey said that the\ninitially zany-seeming\nidea was met at first with\npositivity from students,\nbut a more mixed response\nfrom staff.\n\u201cMany were kind of\ndismissive,\u201d said Jakub,\n\u201cbut I don\u2019t see why. It\u2019s\non a small scale right now,\nand if there is a chance that\nit will improve the student\nexperience and make\nthem better scientists, I\nthink it\u2019s worth trying.\u201d\nLuke explained that\nit\u2019s because introducing\nnew methods can seem\nlike an implied criticism\nof old styles, though once\nexposed to innovation\nmany staff change their\nminds \u2013 a sentiment\nthat Professor Simone\nBuitendijk, the Vice\nProvost (Education) and\nhead of the Learning and\nTeaching Strategy (LTS),\nagreed with.\n\u201cOlder methods\nweren\u2019t bad, it\u2019s just that\ntimes are changing and\nwe know of more efficient\nmethods now. Some of\nit is, for example, due to\ntechnological advances.\nThe data we have from\nChemical Kitchen: Leading the Charge on Innovation\nFirst year Chemistry students have been introduced to laboratory work this year via an unexpected medium:\ncooking and the kitchen\n\u201cThey have\na chance\nto funnel\ncreativity into\nthe dish they\ncreate on the\nlast day - no\ntwo plates are\nthe same\"\ndesign an experiment to\nfind the optimal method\nand temperature needed\nto cook egg yolks in a specific way on the second\nday, and on the last day\n\u201cIt's the same\nchemistry\nskills but with\na new face, so\nstudents feel\ncomfortable\nbeing unsure\nor vulnerable\u201d\nA dish created by students during Chemical Kitchen // Thomas Angus\n\n"

All\njokes asides, if any of you\nhave read more than 3\narticles on FT or spoke to\na Business School student\nfor 5 minutes, you\u2019ve\nprobably heard of a deriv-ative, but what exactly are\nthey?\nA Brief Introduction to Derivatives\nformally, it\u2019s a contract\nbetween 2 parties that\nstates the condition for\nwhich payments are made\nto each party. The main\ntypes of derivatives you\u2019ll\nencounter are options,\nswaps, futures and\nforwards. The \ufb01gure in the\narticle shows the common\ntype of derivatives. I\u2019ll\nspare you another 500\nwords of \ufb01nancial jargon\nand instead explain each\none as simply as I can.\nHaving an Option\nThere are two different\ntypes of options, calls and\nputs. Call options give\nthe owner the right but\nnot the obligation to buy\nthe underlying stock at\na given price on/before\na particular date. A put\noption is the opposite,\nthe owner has the right\nto sell the underlying\nstock at a given price on\na particular date. Let\u2019s say\nyou think that the price of\nApple\u2019s stock is set to rise\nfrom $250 over the next\nmonth. You go to your\nfavourite broker and buy a\ncall option for $50 which\nstates that you can buy\n100 Apple shares at $260\nwithin the next 30 days. If\nApple\u2019s stock goes up to\n$270, then you can make\nand you\u2019d lose $50 (the\nprice of the option).\nFancy a Swap?\nA swap is exactly\nwhat is sounds like. The\nsimplest example is an\ninterest rate swap. Let\u2019s\nsay I own a $1,000,000\ninvestment that pays me\n1% LIBOR each month\n(London Interbank\noffered rate) and you own\na $1,000,000 investment\nthat pays you a \ufb01xed rate\nof 1.2%. The LIBOR\nkeeps changing in the\nmarket whereas the \ufb01xed\nrate is well, \ufb01xed. I don\u2019t\nlike the volatility of this\nLIBOR rate but you\u2019re\nhappy with the risk as you\nhave a chance of receiv-price of wheat goes up,\nyou will lose out on the\npotential gains. Now\nimagine you\u2019re bread\nmanufacturer and you\nthink the price of wheat\nis set to rise; you could\nbuy a futures contract to\n\ufb01x the price of the wheat\nto control your costs. If it\ndoes rise, you\u2019ll only pay\nwhat the futures contract\nstated. All these trades\nhappen via a central\nexchange.\nA forward is quite like\na future with the only\ndifference being that\nforwards are not traded\non an exchange but on an\nOTC (over the counter)\nmarket. It is therefore not\nregulated which means\nit involves some amount\n$950 (100*(270-260) -50). However, let\u2019s say\ninstead of going up, the\nstock price went down.\nIn this case you wouldn\u2019t\nexercise the call option\nThis editor is surprised to learn that Derivatives encompasses all these financial products // Finideas\n\u201cYou now\nprobably know\nenough\nto not sound\nlike a\ncomplete\nnonce when\nasked about\nderivatives in\nan interview.\u201d\nof risk. It\u2019s possible that\neither the buyer or seller\nin the contract is not able\nto pay the amount due in\nwhich case, they don\u2019t\nhave to pay the money\nback. More risk = better\nprices.\nThese are the main\ntypes of derivatives; you\ncan however get more\nexotic derivatives with\nmore complicated payoff\nstructures, but that\u2019s for\nanother time. You now\nprobably know enough to\nnot sound like a complete\nnonce when asked about\nderivatives in an inter-view.\ning higher payments. So\nessentially, we just swap.\nForwards and Futures\nA future is an agreement between parties to\nbuy or sell an asset at a\ncertain time in the future\nfor a speci\ufb01c price. For\nexample, if you plan to\ngrow 1000 bushels of\nwhat next year, you could\ngrow the wheat and then\nsell it for whatever the\ntrading price is. You could\nalso lock in a price now by\nselling a futures contract\nthat states that you must\nsell 1000 bushels for a\n\ufb01xed price. Doing this\nmeans you eliminate the\nrisk of a drop in wheat\nprices. However, if the\nAny \ufb01nancial product\nthat has their value based\noff some underlying asset\nis a derivative.

There were many big\nannouncements but very few release dates. Let\u2019s go over everything covered this weekend.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nA\nfter the failure\nof last year\u2019s\nBlizzcon with\nthe likes of\nDiablo Immortal, and\nthe recent controversy\nsurrounding Activision\nBlizzard, all eyes looked\nto this year in anticipation\nof how they could redeem\nthemselves. Oh, did they\never! Let\u2019s take a deep\ndive into all the major\nannouncements from\nBlizzcon this weekend\nand what they mean for\nthe future of these beloved\nfranchises.\nDiablo\nDiablo 4 is a thing! This\nwas the \ufb01rst thing they\nannounced and I could not\nbe more excited! It looks\nto be a lot darker and\nmore gruesome than the\nprevious games, taking\nplace far in the future with\na gory aesthetic reminiscent of Diablo 2 (satanic\nrituals, occult symbols,\nLOTS of blood). As far\nas we know, Diablo 4 will\nrequire an always-online\nconnection; this is because\nyour group of demon\nslayers can run into other\nparties in real-time. The\ngameplay seems quite\nsimilar to what we\u2019ve\nseen in previous itera-tions. As far as the story\ngoes, we are seeing the\nreturn of Lilith, daughter\nof Mephisto; however, the\ngame is meant to be very\nnon-linear with 5 regions\nyou can explore in any\norder at your own pace.\nNo release date yet but we\nwill keep you posted.\nOverwatch\nSo apparently Overwatch was due for a\nsequel. Overwatch 2 was\nannounced this weekend.\nThis full-on sequel will\nfeature the same gameplay\nbut with new heroes and\nnew maps as well as a\nfocus on co-op and PvE\nmodes. The strange thing\nabout this announcement\nis that Overwatch 1\nplayers can still play\nonline with owners of\nOverwatch 2, and in\nfact, all your skins and\ncosmetics will jump over\nto 2\u2026 so you won\u2019t lose\nanything there. This was\nall announced with a cinematic trailer called Zero\nHour in which we saw\nmany returning heroes\n\ufb01ght off a robot invasion\nwith the aid of a new\n\u201cStrangely,\nOverwatch 1\nplayers can\nstill play online\nwith owners of\nOverwatch 2\u201d\n\u201cDescent of\nDragons is\nlooking to\ncomplete the\nstory of the\nLeague of\nexplorers and\nco. battling\nthe league of\nE.V.I.L\u201d\nhero, Echo. Furthermore,\nthe \ufb01rst Canadian hero\nwas announced, Sojourn.\nSojourn has been in over-watch before but never as\na playable character so\nthis is very exciting to see.\nThere is also a new talent\nsystem available in which\nyou level up heroes; it is\nstill unclear how that will\nwork when cross-play\nbetween Overwatch 1 and\n2 is available. Finally,\nJeff Kaplan, the game\u2019s\ndirector, said he has \u201cno\nidea\u201d when the game is\ncoming out, so, again, we\nwill keep you posted!\nWorld of Warcraft\nWorld of Warcraft\nShadowlands: that just\nsounds epic. This new\nexpansion to World of\nWarcraft releases next\nyear where players are\ntaken to an alternate realm\nof death and decay as they\nmust choose from several\nfactions to \ufb01ght Sylvanus\nafter she destroys the\nLich King, Bolvar. In the\nepic cinematic trailer,\nSylvanus uses Bovar\u2019s\nhelmet to tear open the\nsky and destroy the\nbarrier between Azeroth\n(the main are of World of\nWarcraft) and the Shadowlands. As always there\nis a massive overhaul of\nthe game\u2019s systems with\nthe main aspects being: a\nnew end game dungeon\nthat looks like its own\nrogue-like experience and\na new level cap of\u2026. 60?\nAs confusing as this is,\nwith the previous level cap\nbeing 120, it is a bene\ufb01t as\nit will make grinding to\nmax level much quicker.\nThe current level of\nmaxed-out characters\nwill be reduced to 50 so\nyou still have 10 levels\nto progress through this\nexpansion\u2026 with unique\nupgrades to abilities and\ntalents every level it will\nbe the type of progression\nthat players can feel.\nHearthstone\nCapping off the end of\nthe year of the dragon celebration in Hearthstone,\nthe 3rd expansion this year\nis Descent of Dragons.\nSurprise surprise, many\nmore dragons to add to\nyour collection! With\nseveral new mechanics\nand a new keyword\n\u201cInvoke,\u201d it looks like\nthe meta is going to get\nshifted quite substantially.\nInvoke is tied to Galakrond, the progenitor of\nall dragonkind \u2013 a very\npowerful hero card that\ncan be upgraded through\n3 separate forms. He can\nbe buffed while in your\ndeck and any card with\nthe invoke keyword will\ncause him to be buffed.\nEvery player will receive\nGalakrond upon logging\nin so don\u2019t worry about\nmissing out on that fun!\nDescent of Dragons is\nlooking to complete the\nstory of the League of\nExplorers and co. battling\nthe League of E.V.I.L.\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise:\nthere is a new mode being\nadded! Battlegrounds is\na release date, mark\nDecember 10th on your\ncalendars.\nSmaller News\nSo now with the big\nannouncements out of the\nway (no Starcraft, I know,\nI\u2019m sad too), let\u2019s wrap up\nsome of the smaller, yet\nstill exciting, announce-ments. Diablo Immortal,\nthe phone version of\nDiablo that got everyone\ninto a rage was playable\nand looks very cool. It is\nstill in development with\nno release date (hey, I\u2019m\nnoticing a pattern here)\nbut I don\u2019t imagine it will\nbe much longer given that\nit was announced a year\nago.

A choice between chaos with Johnson\nor a strong and stable\nCorbyn, or maybe it was\nthe other way round?\nFor many it is a choice\nbetween Brexit, championed by Boris Johnson,\nand remain, championed\nby a woman that would\nbe prime minister: Jo\nSwinson.\nAlthough Brexit will\ndefine and dictate the\noutcome of this election,\nthere are a plethora of\nother issues which desperately need to be put to the\npeople. Whether it be the\nNHS, housing, education\nor the environment, since\nthis decisive (or divisive)\nquestion was asked,\neverything else has been\nput on hold. Already, the\nprivatization of the NHS\nhas been the first headline\nissue but as with most\nelections, it will probably\nbe forgotten quicker than\nyou can say \u201cJacob Reese-Mogg has no common\nsense\u201d. What this election\nneeds is some healthy\ndebate about a range of\nissues.\nIn recent years, the\nLabour-Tory duopoly has\nbeen breaking down due to\nthe appearance of smaller\nparties. Unfortunately, the\ncurrent first past the post\nvoting system, a party can\nwin a majority of seats in\nParliament without having\neven near to a majority of\nthe popular vote. This was\nthe case in 2015 when the\nTories won a parliamentary majority with only\n37% of the popular vote.\nAs weird as this sounds,\nparties only need to be the\nmost popular party in each\nconstituency and thus\nwhen third place parties\nbecome more important,\nthe margins for victory\nbecome tiny.\nOne party, which is\ntrying to push a more\ndiverse set of issues, has\nhad some impact despite\nbeing very new. They have\nover 65,000 members\nacross the country, 15,000\nmore than the Greens.\nThey have over 50\nbranches across the UK\nbut chances are you\u2019ve\nnever heard of them. They\nare the Women\u2019s Equality\nParty.\nFormed in 2015 by\nCatherine Mayer and the\nlegendary Sandi Toksvig,\nthe Women\u2019s Equality\nParty hoped to push for an\negalitarian society. Equal\npay, representation, and\nfair treatment of women\nin the media were some\nof the party\u2019s initial goals.\nMuch like Brexit, this new\nsort of political ideology\nunited those from across\nthe political spectrum who\nall agree that women\u2019s\nissues have for too long\nbeen put on hold.\nUnfortunately, the\nparty has had very limited\nelection success in the 350\nmillion elections we have\nhad since 2015. Their\ncandidate, Kay Wesley,\nwas elected as a councillor to Congleton Town\nCouncil in 2019, but what\nabout women outside of\nCongleton? Former party\nleader, Sophie Walker,\nunderstood that winning\nelections was not the\nprimary goal of the party.\nPlaces where the party\nmade an appearance,\nwomen\u2019s issues were all of\na sudden put on the table\nby the other mainstream\nparties. You can\u2019t ignore\nwomen\u2019s issues if you\ncome face to face with\nthe unapologetic feminist\nstance that this party has\ntaken. An example of\nthis was when Labour\nmayor Steve Rotheram\nembarked upon a long-term plan to end violence\nagainst women and girls\nin Liverpool. This bold\nmove was done, according to him, due to Tabitha\nMorton, the Women\u2019s\nEquality mayoral candi-date, who had made it a\npriority in her campaign.\nThere are many other\nexamples of this across\nthe country, and although\nthey are not always as\ntangible, a general shift in\nthe conversation towards\nwomen\u2019s issues is being\nseen.\nThis is all well and\ngood, but unfortunately, a\nstrong Women\u2019s Equality\nparty or any other small\nparty for that matter\ncould split the vote and\nmisrepresent the views\nof constituents. As afore-mentioned, the system\nis flawed and as smaller\nparties become stronger\nand stronger, our voting\nsystem gets weaker and\nweaker. Women across\nthe country who may\nbe inclined to vote for\nthis feminist party might\nbe doing themselves a\ndisservice if they take\nvotes away from Labour,\nfor example, and pave the\nway for the Conservatives.\nAlthough the Women\u2019s\nEquality Party is the main\nfocus here, other parties\nare available too \u2013 and\nthey all pose the same\nissues. The Green Party\nfor example, has been\nfaring better and better in\nelections with a historic\nresult in the European\nelections. However, they\ncould also cost Labour\nsome seats as they split\nthe vote. Labour\u2019s new\ninitiatives like the Green\nNew Deal can be seen\nin part as a way of reconquering some of the\npolitical territory linked to\nenvironmental issues. The\nGreen Party will probably\nnot have more than a bike-load of MPs journeying to\nparliament on December\n14th, but they have had an\nimpact on the politics of\nother parties which could\npossibly make their way\ninto government.\nUnfortunately, it is not\nall sunshine and rainbows\nin the current political\nscene. The Brexit Party,\nwhich may or may not\nhave huge electoral\nsuccess, has already had\na huge impact especially\non the Conservative\npolicy. The pressure, and\nthe chances of a mass\nexodus of bumbling\nBritish Brexit voters from\nthe Tory\u2019s former fanbase\nhas changed the game for\nBoris Johnson. Taking a\nhard stance on Brexit is\nnow his top priority, but\nwill it be enough to prove\nthat he is in fact the real\nBrexit party?\nAnother small party\nwhich is worth a special\nmention is the Lib Dem\u2019s.\nThey definitely do not\nwant to be known as such\nand want so desperately\nto gain the credibility of\nbeing a main party with a\nreal chance of winning the\nwhole thing. A Lib Dem\nmajority seems as likely\nright now as Brexit by the\n31st of October (2019).\nUnlike the Green party\nand the Women\u2019s Equality\nparty, the centrist politics\nof the Lib Dems means\nthey do not really cause\nshifts in other parties\u2019\npolicies. Sure, Labour has\nadopted the policy of a\nconfirmatory referendum,\nbut many within the party\nhad been pushing for this\nfor a while.\nFringe parties can help\nopen political discourse,\ndiversifying the debate\nand pushing bigger parties\non key issues. However,\nwhen they get a bit too\nbig, they start to actually\ncause more harm than\ngood \u2013 at least in our\ncurrent electoral system.\nThe Lib Dems today,\nhave the potential of\nletting a ditch-dying Boris\nJohnson walk into number\nten stronger than ever.\nBut at the end of the day,\nsmall parties do have the\npower to impact politics\nwithout winning that\nmany votes. Maybe one\nday an LGBTQ+ party\nwill spring up shifting\nthe discourse or even a\nStudents party hoping to\nlower tuition fees to pre-Clegg levels.\nCatherine Mayer, one of the WEP co-founders// Wikimedia\n\n"

In 2018, a pro-EU\ncampaign group aiming to\nhold another referendum\nwas formed, People\u2019s\nVote, and with it subsequent marches of masses\nin London throughout the\npast year.\nAmong the supporters\nof the People\u2019s Vote group\nare Liberal Democrats,\nsome conservative MPs,\nand companies like\nSuperdry that do not\nwant to renounce to the\nEU market. Although\nsupported by them,\nPeople`s Vote represents\nthe more humble sector\nof the pro-EU movement,\nusually referred to as \u201cthe\npeople\u201d in political dis-course. This has morphed\nthe pro-EU faction into a\npopular mass movement\nfighting for immigration,\nsocial progress, and job\nsecurity amongst other\nissues, professing a feeling\nof love and faith in the\nEU being the solution to\nthese issues: \u201cEUphoria\u201d.\nBut how is this pro-EU\nattitude related to the motivations behind People\u2019s\nVote?\nBrexit per se refers\nto the action of the UK\nleaving the EU, and thus\noriginally was a politically blank term that allowed\nfor interpretation of any\npolitical and economic\nflavour. Brexit, as seen\ntoday, however, is a political process associated\nwith the right wing of the\npolitical spectrum. With\na Conservative govern-ment, Brexit has become\na materialisation of a\nxenophobic and materialist mindset of \u201cthe EU is\nstealing from us\u201d, which is\njust one of the two sides of\nthe separatist movement\ncoin (we will consider the\nother side later). This conservative agenda of Brexit\ninduced. This same bargaining attitude was taken\nwhen UK decided to leave\nthe EU, enforcing stricter\nand stricter requirements\non the conditions of a\ndeal as time passes. So,\nwhy have these measures\nnot awakened an anti-EU\nmovement in the lower\nclasses that conform the\nPeople\u2019s Vote?\nThe other side of the\nseparatist coin is that of\n\u201cthe people\u2019s\u201d: wanting\neconomic independence\nto secure jobs and support\nfor lower sectors and\nsocial progress. In other\nEuropean countries,\nthis sentiment is often\nrepresented by leftist\neuro-skeptic parties like\nSyriza in Greece (before\naccepting the EU\u2019s loans)\nand Podemos in Spain.\nThese parties tend to\nbe populist (meaning\nthey focus their political discourse on \u201cthe\npeople\u201d, or the working\nclass, and often pit them\nagainst \u201cthe elite\u201d, such\nas the EU as a political\ninstitution) and are often\nborn out of mass movements in times of crisis,\nwhether political, social\nor economic. This origin\nin the masses gives the\nparty enough knowledge\nabout their motivations\nto articulate a coherent\nframework for them: an\nideology. Once the group\naccepts this ideology, the\n\u201c[The EU uses]\ntravelling, free\nmovement\nof labour\nand trade as\nbargaining\ntools to attract\nouter states\nand keep its\nmembers in\u201d\nmovement goes from\nhaving a passive role\nreacting against opposing\nconditions to being able to\nactively assess them from\nPeter from Somerset loves an All Day Brexit // Wikipedia\n\u201cthe people\nare left alone,\nforced to turn\nto the EU for\nan already\nestablished\nideological\nframework\nthat is not\nfully coherent\nwith their\nmotivations.\ntheir ideological ground\nand loses its spontaneous\ncharacter due to their\norganized representation\nas a party.\nIn the case of the UK,\nthe political conditions\nof Brexit resulted in such\na popular movement: the\nPeople`s Vote. With no\npolitical force similar to\nthe ones discussed above,\nmembers of what now is\nthe People\u00b4s vote only had\nLabour as a last resort.\nBut Labour\u2019s indecisive\nsupport for the left-wing\ncaseforBrexitandtheirin-trinsic centre-left position\ndoes not allow them to\nfill an organizational role\nfor this movement. As\nBrexit has been presented\nas right-wing from the\nstart, and with no immediate alternative that\nis consistent with their\npolitical interests, \u201cthe\npeople\u201d are left alone,\nforced to turn to the EU\nfor an already established\nideological framework\nthat is not fully coherent\nwith their motivations.\nIn this way the popular\nanti-conservative opinion\norganized itself into the\nPeople\u2019s Vote movement.\nnegatively implicates the\nlower and middle classes\nof society, including im-migrants, which is what\nmotivated a reactionary\nprogressive attitude\nagainst Brexit.\nHowever, the EU is one\nof the least democratic\norganisms in Europe,\nneoliberal and historically\nin favour of austerity\nmeasures. The main fears\nof Brexit are rooted in\nhow the EU has monopolized certain rights to\nitself: travelling, working\nabroad, trade... it uses\nthese rights as bargaining\ntools to attract outer states\nand keep its members in.\nThe EU has previously put\nthese methods in practice,\nthe prime example being\nthe billions worth in\ncuts imposed to Greece\nin exchange for loans\nto solve the very crisis\nthat EU\u2019s liberal market\nHow the lack of a \u2018left-wing\u2019 Brexit has allowed the EU to become the party of the people\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 8TH NOVEMBER, 2019\nThus, this has resulted\nin \u201cEUphoria\u201d, a sort of\nStockholm syndrome\nwhere people fighting for\ncertain rights deposit their\nhopes in the very same\ninstitution that threatens\nto take them away.\nDue to these circum-stances, the EU has\nbecome the opposite\nof what a conservative\nBrexit (or just Brexit\nitself) stands for: a source\nof ethical authority, tolerance and democracy. It\nhas taken on the role of\nleftist parties, mobilizing\n\u201cthe people\u201d through the\nPeople\u2019s Vote movement\nand neoliberal forces\nalike. This has resulted\nin a fervent defence of\nthe EU as the natural\nantagonist to the right,\nand further ingrained\nthe European idea of democracy in the left wing.\nThrough People\u2019s Vote,\nBrexit has become the key\nto the EU to strengthening\nits hold over the UK, even\nfor socioeconomic classes\nwhose interests they work\nagainst.\n\n"

This\nproduction has taken\nfour years to reach fruition and is the second\npiece from this duo. The\nchoreography encourages\nintrospection and plunges\ninto the millennial psyche.\nIt will enthrall and captivate mature audiences.\nUpon entering, the\nstage is level with the\nfirst row of seats. Layered\nsquares of light form a\nbackdrop, mimicking a\ndiscotheque. As opposed\nto other contemporary\npieces that at times seem\nquite formal and detached\nfrom the audience, BEAT\nprovides a breath of fresh\nair. From angled lights\nthat allow the dancer to\nsee the eyes of the spectators to the minimal staging\nwhere the DJ is nowhere\nin sight, everything is set\nto maximise engagement.\nFor contemporary\ndance first-timers, the\nopening section may be\nslightly confusing (we\ncertainly did not know\nwhat we were getting\ninto) but it remains\ngripping nonetheless.\nSoon though, it becomes\nclear that the thought-pro-voking routine tries to\nexplore many different\nfacets of our generation.\nOne of our personal highlights was the expression\nthrough movement of\nselfie culture, a part where\nthe dancer stands in the\nmiddle of the stage and\nthe lights change rapidly,\ncreating the illusion of\nscrolling through a social\nmedia app.\nThe choreography\nitself is varied and inno-vative, incorporating a\nrange of different styles,\nincluding salsa and ballet.\nThe repetitive movements\nused throughout the dance\nare an expression of the\nmundane, lives that we all\nlive - clearly not utilising\nthe full capacity - and the\npiece makes us painfully\naware of our own physical\nredundancies. These\nactions are physically\ndeconstructed throughout\nthe piece on a background\nof deep house beats and\nrapidly changing lights;\ntheircolourandmovement\ndesigned to rope you into\nthis fantastic recreation\nof the disco culture.\nThey also complement\nperfectly the attention to\ndetail through which Margarita addresses her facial\nexpressions, a quality\nthat is lacking in many\ncontemporary pieces (we\nlearned this by speaking\nto audience members who\nwere professional chore-ographers).\nTowards the end of the\nroutine, she swings her\narms in an expression of\nfreedom while the lights\nfrom all 6 directions\naround her cycle through\nred, green and blue. The\nrapid changes disarm\nyou, and they completely\nfit the mood of the heavy\nbasslines echoing through\nthe hall. In an age of\nhyperconnectivity, BEAT\noffers a chance to switch\noff and immerse yourself\nin the unforgivingly\nhonest worldview by an\nup-and-coming company\nalready making waves in\nthe contemporary dance\nworld. It\u2019s magnificently\nraw.\nBirminghamRoyalBalletMixedBill:Athree-coursemeal\nB\ni r m i n g h a m\nRoyal Ballet\nis on tour at\nSadler\u2019s Wells\nwith a three-part mixed\nbill to suit anyone\u2019s taste.\nThree separate pieces by\ndifferent minds to dive\ninto.\nThe first piece, A Brief\nNostalgia (directed by\nJack Lister) is unsettling.\nTwo large slates. One\ndancer. Her shadow cast\non the wall whilst she intensely holds a Couru po-sition. The music, an eerie\ndramatic sound, is enough\nto stun you into a pleasant confusion. The focus\nshifts suddenly to another dancer with her shadow on a different slate. A\nstunning beginning, the\ndarkness surrounding the\nslates formed perfect harmony with the music and\nmovements. However,\nwhat followed provided\nno relief and the movements became more cha-otic, leaving only confu-sion. The shadows on the\nslate became secondary\nrather than complementary to the dancers. Lister\ndid end the piece with a\nbeautiful duet neverthe-less. Adding to the atmos-phere, the dancers\u2019 loose\nclothing heightened the\nflow in their movements\nand tunnelling gas seeped\noff the floor towards the\naudience.\nNext was The Suit, directed by Cassa Pancho,\nfounder of Ballet Black.\nBallet Black aims to improve representation for\nBlack and Asian dancers.\nRegardless of demograph-ics, The Suit was humorous and well thought out.\nThe plot follows a couple\u2019s strained relationship\nfrom when the female\npartner has an affair. The\nsimple furniture used on\nstage and the acting skills\nof the talented dancers\nbrought to life a play that\ncould be followed by any\naudience member. Pancho successfully used the\nchoir to accentuate the\nprincipal dancer\u2019s move-ments, to create separate\nstorylines simultaneously\nand to clearly demonstrate\nthe tension between the\ncouple. The choir members were even brilliant\nprops, remodelling into\neveryday items as needed.\nThe titular suit is an artistic symbol - the suit of the\nman the female partner\nslept with. The excellent\ntechnical use of the suit is\nworth the visuals, thus I\nwould thoroughly recommend you see this piece.\nMy favourite from the\nnight.\nNina Sinatra Songs,\ndirected by Twyla Tharp,\nwas a conflicting piece for\nme. The choice of Frank\nSinatra\u2019s music was ex-cellent. I couldn\u2019t help but\nsing along. The seven couples all exhibited various\nballet moves in ballroom\nform. Unfortunately, it\nfelt forced. Merging ballet dancers with glorious\ngowns and heels to replicate a ballroom setting\ndid justice to neither ballet nor ballroom dancing.\nMoreover, while the clear\ntheme of Tharp\u2019s choreography was love, I only\ntruly felt the tenderness\nin one out of the seven\ncouples. Moving as one\nand fully engaged with\neach other, their chemistry offset the discordance\nin dance styles.

    "content": "Frankenstein: Resurrected for the Modern Day\nForget the body horror of the original - this monster is a cold and calculating AI from the future, a relentless killing\nmachine that will chill you to the core\nI\nt\u2019s been a long time\nsince Frankenstein\nwas first published.\nWritten in 1818 by\nMary Shelley, the gothic\nnovel swiftly became\na cultural icon. Widely\nregarded as one of the first\nscience fiction novels ever\nwritten, Frankenstein follows the tragic tale of Dr\nVictor Frankenstein and\nhis destructive relationship with the monster he\ncreated. Relying heavily\non themes of religion and\nthe supernatural, it is perhaps unsurprising that the\nstory fails to fill us with as\nmuch horror and dread as\nwhen it was first published\nover two hundred years\nago. However, this recent,\nruthless update by the\nNational Youth Theatre\nproves that Frankenstein\nis as relevant a tale as\never. It was brilliantly set\nand incredibly acted, and\nit made use of innovative\nstorytelling techniques.\nThis play was all about\nforcing Frankenstein\ninto the present. Forget\nthe crumbling tower,\nmaniacal laughter, and\ndead, stitched-together\nflesh: the Frankenstein\nI watched was firmly\nmodern, even futuristic.\nA brilliant researcher,\nVictoria Frankenstein\n(Ella Dacres), working at\na laboratory, successfully\ncreates an anthropomorphic AI (Sarah Lusack).\nUpon the realisation that\nher effort to emulate intelligence and feeling has\nbeen successful, Victoria\nis filled with disgust at her\ncreation and rejects her.\nWhat follows is the robot\u2019s\nmurderous revenge on\nher creator, as Victoria\nrepeatedly fails to satisfy\nthe robot\u2019s demands for a\ncompanion.\nIn the original, much\nof the tale is told through\nletters, between Captain\nBob Walton (Natalie\nDunne) and Garth, her\nbrother. Letter writing\nbeing rather pass\u00e9 these\ndays, this antiquated\nmethod of communication was imaginatively\nreplaced through on-stage\nSkype calls between the\ntwo siblings. Fortunately,\nthey manage to avoid the\nusual Skype connectivity\nproblems. Each member\nof the cast was dressed\nin identikit futuristic\nwhite tunics that I would\nnormally assume to\nbelong to the kind of\ndoctors from a nightmarish future.\nThe most futuristic\nsegment was the unexpected addition of Virtual\nReality to the play. VR\nheadsets were left under\neach seat during the\ninterval and we were all\ndirected to put them on to\nwitness Captain Walton\u2019s\nexpedition to the North\nPole. Some truly fantastic\nimagery was beamed\nthrough the headsets,\nwith breathtaking shots\nof the Arctic rescue\naccompanied by how the\nworld looked from the\nrobot\u2019s point of view. We\nsaw the digital renderings\nof faces that were used\nto train the robot\u2019s emotional sensitivity (trippy\nand quite disturbing,\nespecially when they got\nstuck on \u2018terrified\u2019). Most\ninteresting of all, previous\nscenes were displayed to\nus from the robot\u2019s point\nof view, the cast being\nshown in the VR world as\n3D-rendered, Matrix-style\nfigures which shouted at\nand attacked us.\nOverall, this production of Frankenstein was\ntruly stellar. The cast,\nthe set, the sound - each\nelement came together\nto bring the full menace\nof a highly intelligent,\nvengeful machine, violently waging war against\nhumanity and its creator.\nForget Terminator,\nLusack as the monster\nwas cold, calculating, but\nat the same time entirely\nrational in her treatment\nof Dr Victoria Frankenstein. It was remarkable\nhow I empathised with the\ncreature even as it ruthlessly murdered Victoria\u2019s\nfamily and friends. Each\nmurder was accompanied\nby visceral neck-snapping\nsound effects, more than\nenough to make me wince.\nIn scenes where Victoria\nappeared happy and safe,\nthe monster loomed large\nfrom the side-lines, a\nconstant reminder of her\nterrible presence.\nDacres as Dr Frankenstein was as irrational and\nprideful as can be. Her\nfailure to deal honestly\nor effectively with the\nmonster was convincingly\nacted as the agony of her\narrogance came home\nto roost. I thought that\nthe gender-blind casting\nchoice was very interest-ing. In the original text,\nboth Frankenstein and\nthe monster are male,\nand appear to represent a\nhuman\u2019s poor imitation of\nGod\u2019s creation of Adam.\nThe gender-blind casting\nchoice further divorces\nthe production from the\nincreasingly irrelevant\nreligious aspect of the\nnovel. Instead, it forces the\naudience to focus on the\nmore relevant relationship\nbetween mankind and\ntheir tools. What should\nour response be when our\ntools achieve sentience?\nWill we continue to use\nthem as our slaves or will\nwe be forced to make\nconcessions?\nThe rest of the cast\nwere equally fantastic.\nGuy Clarke deserves a\nspecial mention as the\nmost Inspectory Inspector\nthat I have ever seen. He\nhas clearly been watching\nmore than enoughTaggart.\nThe tragedy of Victoria\u2019s\nhusband-to-be\u2019s death\nwas brought home perfectly by Jamie Foulkes.\nThought-provoking and\nchilling in equal measure,\nNYT Rep\u2019s brilliantly\nupdated Frankenstein\nprovided a wonderful\nevening at a particularly\nspooky time of year. Given\nthe remarkable display of\nGreat Expectations put on\nby the same cast the week\nbefore, I am very excited\nto see what each of these\ntalented actors will grow\ninto over the coming\nyears.\nThe creator gazes upon her creation // Helen Murray\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 8TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Editor\nWhere?

Now that I\u2019ve\nhelped you make that\ndecision, we still need to\nget to the bottom of the\nfirst question. To achieve\nthis, we need to have the\nsavoury and the sweet go\nhead to head in a heavyweight championship\nfight. Let\u2019s see who comes\nout victorious.\nIn this corner, we have\nthe savoury section. If you\nare one of those people\nthat finds pancakes and\nbacon blasphemous then\navert your eyes because\nthis place truly pushes\nthe boundaries of what\nbelongs on a pancake. I\u2019m\ntalking things like halal\nlamb curry to duck with\nhoisin sauce. They\u2019ve got\nsome that are basically\npizzas with a pancake base\nlike the Hawaiian with\ncheese, ham and pineap-ple. (I wonder how the\npineapple on pizza haters\nwould feel about this one.)\nThe most important part is\nthat ,crazily enough, they\nall seem to work. With\n21 classic options, this\nsection is great for people\nwho want something new.\nShake up your boring uni\nroutine and get out of the\nrut with these stacks.\nIf you are feeling even\nmore adventurous, you\ncan discard their curated\nchoices and build your\nown from scratch. They\nwon\u2019t judge your combination choices. Now\nthis may all sound a bit\ntoo rich for you and that\nis fair \u2013 it\u2019s not always\nbest to start the day with\nsomething heavy. Well\nthey have just the thing\nfor people like you. Their\nlite menu prides itself on\neverything on it being less\nthan 450 calories and it\u2019s\nall savoury. Sadly, these\ntwo options aren\u2019t part of\nMonday Madness but are\ngreat for when you find\nyourself passing by on\nother days.\nNow in this corner we\nhave the sweet section.\nA runt between the two\nin the fight with just 10\ndo, they do well. The fruits\nare tart and sweet and the\nservings of ice cream\ngenerous. They just have a\ndiversity problem but this\nsection has some friends\nto tag team with in this\nfight. On the sidelines are\nthe butterscotch pancakes,\npoffertjes and waffles.\nNow the butterscotch\npancakes are American\nstyle so they have a\nsmaller diameter and\nmore thickness to them.\nOnly one of them can\ncome savoury as the basic\negg and bacon combo so\nI say these belong on the\nsweet side. The buttermilk\noptions all mirror those of\nthe classic sweets so the\nchoice between the two\ncomes down to a matter of\npreference in texture.\nThe waffles come with\nice cream or cream. Even\nthough you only get one\non the plate, it makes for a\nfilling meal with how high\nthey pile the toppings on\nthis bad boy. Now we are\non to the poffertjes (which\nI still can\u2019t pronounce).\nThey are the most Dutch\nthing on the menu so they\nget points for their authen-ticity. These are quite like\nthe American pancakes\nbut a lot smaller and they\ngive you a lot more of\nthem. The serving size of\nthese are strange to me.\nFor example, the fruit and\nice cake option claims to\nserve 2-4 but one person\ncomfortably finished them\nalone. At the end of the\nday, all of these additions\nto the fight aren\u2019t even\npart of Monday Madness.\nThe waffles get a pass as\nthey are less than or equal\nto the Monday Madness\nprice anyways.\nIt seems that this\nMonday Madness deal\ncomes with a lot of terms\nand conditions and you\u2019re\nright. Many a times I\u2019ve\ntaken friends to eat here\non a Monday and they\nmanaged to just not be\nin the mood for anything\nthat was a part of the offer.\nAlso, university is busy.\nThis deal goes on all day\nbut there will be weeks\nyou won\u2019t eb able to make\nit. So I want you to be set\nfor the rest of the week\nas well. That is why I can\ntell you that is you can get\n20% taken off your bill\nby telling the Manager on\nDuty \u201cPancake Power\u201d\nas you enter. Flashing\nyour student card will get\nyou 10% everyday but\nMonday so save this for\nthe weekend when your\nbuzzword doesn\u2019t work\nanymore. Outside of the\nMadness, every pancake\nyou eat can go towards\nyour stamp card so take\nall your friends with you\nso you can get your 10th\none free.\nAs for my question, if\nyou want to live on the\nedge of acceptability, go\nfor the savoury. Each item\nwill bring a new experience and with so many\nto pick from, it would be\nhard to imagine it getting\nboring. If you want something more comforting\nand familiar to give you a\nquick burst of energy, go\nfor sweet. Or come next\nMonday to see if the grass\nis greener on the other\nside.\nTake a trip to Amsterdam with these poffertjes // Zahra Abiola\nButtery pancakes with syrup? Yes please // Zahra Abiola\n\u201cEach item will\nbring a new\nexperience and\nwith so many\nto pick from, it\nwould be hard\nto imagine\nit getting\nboring\u201d\nclassic options.

In\nteams of three they would\ncompete against Kings\nand UCL, with each\nmember completing a\ntwo-mile run, a six-mile\nbike and a one-mile run\nbefore passing on to the\nnext. The gale force winds\nand torrential rain of the\nprevious day had settled,\nand the first competitors\nlined up on the start line\nto prove themselves.\nThe starting horn\nblew and the race was\nunderway.

Alex Wilson\nof the men\u2019s firsts was\nmoving up in the ranks\nthough, overtaking to\nput him only just behind.\nAnother debutante, Geraldine Regnier, showed off\nthe bike skills she gained\nfrom a summer of touring\nto chase after the speedy\nUCL team occupying the\nlead women\u2019s position.\nMoving on to the final\nleg there was all to play\nfor. Matt Ryan wasted no\ntime closing the gap on\nthe run, exiting the first\ntransition neck-and-neck\nwith first place. He gave\na heroic chase on the\nbike, but on the day his\nprofessionally-sponsored\nopponent pulled away. He\nnonetheless emphatically\nsecured victory in the\nuniversities category,\nfinishing more than ten\nminutes ahead of the\nnext competitors in the\ncategory (Imperial men\u2019s\n2nds).

I mean, I like\nthe idea of having a space\nfor the RCSU in Felix, but\nI can\u2019t shake the feeling\nthat there are fundamental\nissues with the constituent\nunion section as it is.\nEvery other week or so,\nto the left of this column,\nwe are addressed by the\nbeloved CGCU President,\nThomas Cross. He typically goes off on some\ntirade about the Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU),\npractically frothing at the\nmouth whilst doing so.\nI\u2019ve made no secret of\nmy issues with the ICU,\nbut his articles have the\ntact of a crazed homeless\nman shouting at you on\nthe street. And while\nhis articles are often fun\nto read, bringing about\nmeaningful change within\nICU doesn\u2019t arise from\nthis sort of discourse.\nInstead, it just serves to\nalienate readers, giving\nthem the impression that\nreasonably civil.\nNot only is there tonal\ninconsistency between the\ncolumns of the different\nCUs, but it also exists\nwithin our own sections.\nPersonally, I\u2019ve only\nwritten a few articles for\nour section. The other\narticles featured here have\nbeen written by members\non my committee on a\nrange of topics related to\nthe RCSU. As a result,\nthere is no unifying\ntheme, no critical element\nthat binds these articles\ntogether.While they are all\nrelated to the RCSU, they\ndon\u2019t appeal to a single\ntype of student.

A calendar\nwith the events that we\nare doing, coupled with\nnotable news from within\nthe faculty, followed by\nany drama happening in\nthe union. This way, the\ncontent is easily digest-ible, tonally consistent,\nand still allows us to\nhave a voice.

The\nStrategy will be used to\ninform the direction the\nCollege will take with\nregards to investing in\nnew spaces, curriculum\nreview, research foci,\nand more.\nIt builds upon the\nbroader College Strategy,\nwhich identifies the\noverall mission of the\nCollege as an institution,\nby providing more concrete direction in terms of\nwhat it refers to as themes\nand capabilities.\nAs the Provost, Professor Ian Walmsley FRS,\ndescribed it: \u201cthe themes\nare intended to recognise\nareas where the college\nhas strengths or can see\nhow to build strengths,\nwhere the college can\nsee that it can make an\nimpact, and ways in\nwhich it would go about\ndelivering that impact.\u201d\nThe areas affected by\nthe Strategy are broad,\nencompassing staff and\nstudent experience. For\nexample, the Strategy\u2019s\noutlook on societal impact\ntouches on researchers by\nguiding projects towards\nparticular applied foci,\nor students via support\nfor entrepreneurial ac-tivity. Most directly, it\ninfluences the decisions\nof the Provost\u2019s Board\nto provide funding and\nsupport by proposed\nprojects \u2013 whether they\nsuccessfully align with\nthe AS will be carefully\nconsidered as each moves\nthrough a \u201cthree-gateway\u201d\nprocess of assessment.\nIt was developed via\nmeetings with Faculty\nDeans, each of which\npresented their own strategies and vision, as well\nas Heads of Department,\nfollowed by rounds of\ndiscussion and consultation both from staff within\ndepartments and with\nstudents.\nThe AS identifies\nfour themes: Sustainable\nSociety (e.g. energy and\nmanufacturing), Healthy\nSociety (e.g. disease pre-vention), Smart Society\n(e.g. data science and\nmachine learning), and\nResilient Society (e.g.\ninfrastructure.) Each of\nthese will not exist in\nisolation, but instead have\ninterlinking sub-themes,\nin line with a core goal\nof transdisciplinary research \u2013 which is one of\nthe four main capabilities\nof the College identified\nwithin the AS, alongside\nquantitative research,\nentrepreneurial spirit, and\nengagement on the local,\nnational, and regional\nlevel.\nIan identified that the\nway Imperial remains\nworld-leading is by stimulating the \u201cintellectual\nvibrancy\u201d of the College,\nand that transdisciplinary\nresearch will play a large\npart in that. A large part of\nthe College\u2019s dedication\nto this is focused on the\nWhite City campus currently being developed \u2013\nwhich offers opportunity\nfor new spaces, fit-for-use\nin the 21st century, to\nbe constructed with this\ntype of research in mind.\nThe space then vacated\nin South Kensington can\nbe repurposed to further\nsupport this shift in style\nand perspective \u2013 such as\nthe transformation of the\nChemistry building into a\nthe whole College, not for\njust one or two people, so\nwe need to make sure that\nis brought together. Part\nof it is finding out where\npeople in the College have\nsucceeded, and how we\ncan then utilise and share\nthat with other parts of the\nCollege \u2013 joining up those\nideas.\u201d\nWithin the strategy\u2019s\nstructure are several\nworking groups \u2013 one for\neach theme, and one for\nstudent experience. All of\nthem feature staff, but also\nstudent representatives selected in conjunction with\nthe Union. The goal is to\ndraw on these \u201ccommunity leaders\u201d to reach out to\nstudents, and to draw on\ntheir individual expertise\nand knowledge.\nmultidisciplinary teaching\nhub.\nOne issue identified\nwith this is that, further\ndown the line, new fields\nmay develop which\nrequire departments\nrelocated to White City\n\u2013 two miles away \u2013 and\ndepartments still in South\nKensington to co-operate.\nIn this sense, barriers may\nbe constructed to trans-disciplinary research. Ian,\nhowever, remains highly\noptimistic:\n\u201cFirstly - I would hope\nthat in 30 years, the mix\nof disciplines we have\nat the university has\nchanged - it's a vibrant\nand living entity, so that's\nbound to happen. As for\nhow to avoid the problem,\ntake bioengineering as\nan example. They have\na footprint in White City\nand also one in South\nKensington \u2013 so people\nwill have to talk across\ncampuses internally, but\nalso their footprints in\neach location allow them\nto talk to a variety of\ndepartments across cam-puses. I can imagine that\nhaving those communities\nnow connected that way\nprovides new opportunity.\u201d\nThe AS is but one\nof multiple strategies\nthe College employs\nto explain and drive\nits vision forward. For\nexample, the Learning and\nTeaching Strategy, which\nencompasses pedagogy\nand curriculum structure.\nEach of these Strategies\nis, Ian said, intended to fit\ntogether like a \u201cjigsaw\u201d\n\u2013 each one informing\nthe others. He gave the\nexample of projects under\nthe Estates Strategy,\nwhich would typically\nhave more concrete\ngoals, and how they feed\ninto higher-level people-and ideology-focused\nstrategies like the AS or\nCollege Strategy.\n\u201cWe have lots of\nprojects we'd like to do,\nranging from delivering a\nmultidisciplinary teaching\nhub in the Chemistry\nbuilding here [in South\nKensington], to student\nstudy and social spaces\naround College, new research buildings at White\nCity, and so on. The way\nwe prioritise those Estates\npieces should also reflect\nthe priorities of the Academic Strategy. The intention is that these strategies\nall fit together.\u201d\nThis type of thinking\n\u2013 both in terms of emphasising research across\ndepartments and interlinking different strategies \u2013 is\nreflected in the AS\u2019 vision\nfor the student experience.\nIt, too, uses the buzzword\nof \u201cholistic\u201d experience\nthat has become a staple\nof both College and Union\ncommunications. The new\nperspective follows from\nlow NSS scores in recent\nyears, which have been\nrecognised as broader\nCollege issues rather than\nlocalised to departments\nor faculties. As Ian explained it:\n\u201cThere were many\nthings one could see were\nmore fragmented than\nthey might be, and maybe\ndrove us to decisions that\ndidn't take into account all\nof the aspects and ramifications of those decisions.\nSo ensuring that was min-imised was a key part for\nme of thinking about this\npart of the Strategy. Many\nproblems are an issue for\nThe College has developed and revealed its Academic Strategy for the next five years, which contains details of\nthe direction of their decisions and investment at the strategic level\nIan Walmsley, the Provost, who leads on the Academic Strategy // Fergus Burnett\n\n"

In fact\nthere is an entire channel\non Youtube dedicated to\nshowcasing the shenanigans from the crowd\nduring BR broadcasts\n(People of Boiler Room).\nThis show was unique in\nthat the two main artists\nwere live bands and not\nDJs, but the whole event\nwas still livestreamed\nOnce Inside, the office\n/venue was packed;\neveryone immediately\npiled into the bandroom,\nwanting to be as close\nas possible for the per-formance. Thankfully,\nthe show was BYOB,\nannounced earlier in the\nday in an email titled\n\u201cIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT\nBATTLES + BLACK\nMIDI TONIGHT\u201d, containing only the message\n\u201cIt\u2019s BYOB xoxoxo\u201d.\nAfter soundcheck-ing infront of the full\naudience, Black Midi\nbegan their show with\n\u201c953\u201d, the opener from\ntheir debut Schlangenheim, released earlier this\nyear. The band switched\nbetween different jittery\ntime signatures with ease,\na testament to their strong\nchemistry and technical\nability - more impressive\nfor the fact the lead singer\nprobably gets ID\u2019d buying\na Red Bull. One of the advantages of playing such\na small space is the tight\nacoustics, which really\nshowcases how well BM\nuse a range of dynamics\nacross their songs. At one\npoint in the opener, explosive drums and feedback\ndie away to reveal a\ntwinkly guitar line played\nso softly you practically\ncan hear those outside on\nthe balcony lighting up a\nfag. This only lasts for a\nbrief moment, before the\ndrums and other guitars\ncome crashing back in\nwith the same intensity.\nThere\u2019s only a brief\npause before they spin\ninto their next, in which\nthe double-digit audience\nbarely has time to offer\napplause. \u201cOf Schlangenheim\u201d is much the same as\nbefore, with a constantly\nevolving tempo and\nrhythm, but with a throbbing pulse of sub-bass\nthat ricochets through the\nroom. Without pausing,\nthe band launches into\nto the iconic opening\nnotes of \u2018bmbmbm\u2019. The\nquickly-muttered vocals\nare noticeably different\nto the studio version, and\nthe seemingly-impatient\nband members improvise\nover the otherwise sparse\ndrums + bassline here.\nDuring \u2018Ducter\u2019, the\nfinale from their debut\nalbum, the music almost\ncompletely stops during\nthe breakdown, and the\nlead singer stands softly\nplucking his guitar, giving\nthe audience a \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d-esque\nsmirk as he whispers into\nthe microphone. The bass\nthen slowly creeps back\nin, followed by the drums\nand other drums, bringing\ntheir sound to dizzying\nnew heights.\nWhen they finally reach\nthe end of their set, it is\nonly the third time all the\nband has stopped together\nso it takes the audience\nmore than a moment\nprocess what they\u2019ve just\nheard. BM then casually\nsaunter through the\nstunned crowd and out\nof the room, seemingly\nunaware of how \u201cBlack\nMidi just melted my\nbrain!\u201d - to quote the\ninstagram story that the\nbloke in front just posted.\nSpare a thought for poor\nFlo Dill, the DJ taking\ncontrol of the music after\nBM and before Battles.\nNot only does she have\nan impossibly hard act\nto follow, but the entire\naudience is concerned\nwith going for a slash\nand a fag before waiting\naround for Battles. Which\nis a shame because she\nends up spinning some\nfunky tunes, finishing\non an upbeat italo edit of\n\u2018The Model\u2019 by Kratwerk\n- a tune so funky Battles\u2019\ndrummer John Stainer\ndrums along to during his\nsoundcheck.\nThe crowd spends\ntheir entire set anxiously\nwaiting to get a good\nposition in the bandroom\nfor Battles\u2019 set, which\nisn\u2019t as easy as it sounds\nas we\u2019re still packed into\nthe tiny office space. One\nmans shout of \u2018Come on\nEngland, come on!!\u2019, was\nmet with chuckles from\nthe sardines. Inspired by\nthis stroke of comedic\ngold, another sardine\nstarts shouting \u2018Hillsborough, Hillsborough!!\u2019,\nwhich was not met with\nchuckles, but cries of\n\u201cFuck off you nonce\u201d\nand \u201cCunt\u201d - the latter\nof which is delivered as\nintensely as BM\u2019s drums.\nBeing packed amongst so\nmany others also lead to\noverhearing a dreadlocked\nwhite guy telling an unimpressed girl how \u2018Yuh,\nso basically after doing\nDMT my life completely\nchanged\u201d\nEventually some\naudience members are\nlet in, and Battles begin\nwith \u2018Font Green Park\u2019,\na single from their latest\nalbum (which also has the\nnonsensical title of \u2018Juice\nB Crypts\u2019). Originally a\n4-piece, Battles have lost 2\nmembers across 4 albums\nand 12 years - quite the\nratio! Their music relies\nheavily on loops, so most\nof their songs begin with\na simple bassline which is\nlooped and another layer\nis then added over the top.\nThrough doing this the\ntwo-piece can essentially\nhave as many sounds as\nthey like playing over\neach other. Still, both\nband members have their\nwork cut-out for them:\nJohn Stainer plays drums\nwith two hands and all his\nheart, whilst Ian Williams\nplays a combination of\nkeys, guitar and synth\npad, often simultaneously.\nAlthough I\u2019m much\ncloser to the band this\ntime, I\u2019m behind a\n\u2018wannabe member of the\nBoiler Room crew\u2019 who\nspends most of the set\nrecording through their\ncracked iPhone 5. Perhaps\nshe was so focused on\nher amateur recordings\nto notice the professional\ncameraman standing\ndirectly to her right.\nUnlike BM, Battles\nare very happy to spend\nthe majority of their set\nrattling through their\nlatest release, it was\nsatisfying to watch them\ngradually construct their\ndense sound, layer by\nlayer, only relying on\nsamples for the parts of\nthe guest vocalists. Also,\nunlike BM, Battles take\na moment to thank the\naudience between songs,\nthere\u2019s no audio in the mic\nso drummer Ian quickly\nrattles off a \u2018Ba dum tss!\u201d.\nHighlights include\nlead single \u2018Titanium 2\nStep\u2019, which begins with\ndrums coming in hard\nand slow, before adding a\nfidgety guitar riff, synths\nand eventually vocals. At\nmany points in this song\nand throughout their set\nit seems almost as if there\nare more band members\nlurking in another corner\nof the office, or that they\nmight be playing to a\nbacking track, however\nin a few barely noticeable\nmoments, a loop cuts out\nslightly early and their\ndrums are a fraction off\nthe beat. This only serves\nto humanize their music\nand makes the otherwise\nclinical precision in which\nthey play so much more\nimpressive.\nI was lucky enough to\nnab a copy of the setlist\nand meet the band after-wards, which made the\nwhole experience even\nbetter. This is easily one\nof the best shows I\u2019ve\never seen, although my\nears are still ringing from\nBlack Midi. The videos\nare all up on Boiler Rooms\nchannel, watch it loud for\nmaximum impact!\nMUSIC\nAlex Baldwin\nMusic Writer\nSupport Artist: Black Midi\nVenue: The Boiler Room\nDate: 29th\nOctober 2019.\nTicket Price: Free\nBattles\n\u201cBlack Midi\ncasually\nsaunter\nthrough the\nstunned\ncrowd,\nseemingly\nunaware of\nbrains\u201d\na 25-minute long jam\nof mostly unreleased\nmaterial. From the way the\nband members exchange\nglances it almost seems\nas if they\u2019re improvising,\nalthough the music is\nso tight this is probably\nthe result of countless\nhours of practice. Despite\nhaving a recent album and\na few singles released,\nBM spend the majority of\ntheir short set whizzing\nthrough this new material.\nIt\u2019s unclear where one\nsong ends and the next\nbegins, or if this simply\none mammoth song. The\ndifferent sections of this\njam are diverse enough\nthat it remains interesting,\nand the band even manage\nto carve out some big\nhooks, more than making\nup for the lack of vocals\nin this section. The music\nremains anchored by the\nunrelenting drumming\nthroughout.\nAfter a while this\nsubsides, and gives way\n\n"

That was the\nexact scenario in which I\nfound myself after picking up a copy of Felix\nlast Friday afternoon.\nThe article in the\n1ST\nof November issue\ncalled \u2018An opinion on\nthe Hong Kong issue\u2019\ninitially thrilled me as\nI was glad to finally see\nsome coverage on this\nongoing issue. However,\nas soon as I read past the\ntitle, it was all downhill\nfrom there.\nThe writer introduced\nthe Extradition Bill\nthat the Hong Kong\ngovernment tried to\nenact on the people (on\nChina\u2019s behalf) \u2013 an act\nthat resulted in more\nthan two sevenths of the\nentire population on the\nstreets protesting. Had\nthe bill passed, it would\nhave had detrimental\nconsequences on the\nfreedom of all Hong\nKongers, giving China\nthe power to extradite\nanyone in Hong Kong\nto be judged under the\nChinese legal system\nwhich many organisa-tions, such as Amnesty\nInternational, have expressed concerns about\ndue to their repeated\nviolation of the defendants\u2019 rights to a fair trial.\nIn paragraph 3 of\nthe article, the writer\nstated that \u201cthe Hong\nKong police have been\nmarkedly restrained\nin the face of blatant\nviolence by the protesters\u201d \u2013 a severe disinformation easily disprov-able by simple acts of\nGoogling. Instances of\nunnecessary violence\nfrom the Hong Kong\npolice happened far too\noften to be counted, but\nan incident that immediately comes to mind\nis what happened on\nthe night of the 31ST\nof\nAugust.\nKnown as the \u2018831\u2019\nincident, the police\ncharged into the Prince\nEdward underground\nstation in pursuit of the\nprotestors trying to go\nhome. This turned into\none of the most horrific\nconflicts between the\npolice and the citizens,\nin which several men and\nwomen, including teen-agers, were trapped in an\nunderground carriage,\nsenselessly beaten and\npepper-sprayed by the\npolice. No arrests were\neven made afterward,\nshowing that the police\nfelt no need for the\nscrutiny of law, just the\nneed for violence in an\nattempt to silence those\nwho disagree with the\nsystem.\nNot only have the\nprotesters been caught\nin the scurry of excessive police violence, so\nhave the volunteers and\njournalists on the scene.\nOn the 11TH\nof August,\na medic was shot with\na beanbag round in the\neye, shattering the bones\nof her face. On the 29TH\nof September, an Indonesian journalist was\npermanently blinded by\na rubber bullet. These\nare just a tiny fraction of\ncases in the overwhelming plethora of unjust\nviolence committed\nevery day by the Hong\nKong police force.\nThe writer then said,\n\u201cI could have sympa-thised with the protestors had they not shown\nsuch disrespect toward\ntheir country: stamping,\nburning the Chinese\nflag\u201d \u2013 in what reality is\nrespect towards a flag a\ngreater issue than one\u2019s\nfuture and freedom?\nIn the same para-graph: \u201cMost of us view\nsocial and economic stability as a precursor to\nthe extra freedom held\nas sacred in the West\u201d.\nFreedom of speech is\nnot \u2018extra\u2019; freedom\nof press is not \u2018extra\u2019,\nfreedom of assembly is\nnot \u2018extra\u2019; they are fundamental human rights.\nThose who hold a different view should not\nbe pushing their agenda\nonto others, which is\nexactly what China tried\nto do to Hong Kong with\nthe Extradition Bill and\nwill continuously do\nso unless something is\ndone about it.\nAlso, \u201cforeign interference\u201d is deducted\nwith negative connotations from \u201cphotographs\nof protest leaders with\nWestern officials\u201d. First\nof all, this protest is\nknown to be leaderless \u2013\none of the reasons why\nall Hong Kong Protesters\nwere chosen by TIME to\nbe one of 2019\u2019s most\ninfluential people on\nthe internet. Secondly,\nto quote Martin Luther\nKing: \u2018Injustice\nanywhere is a threat to\njustice everywhere\u2019. It\nis in human nature to\nright what is wrong. It\nis also in human nature\nto seek help and to help.\nAnd that is the reason\nbehind both the leader-less-proactivity from the\nHong Kongers and the\nbipartisan support from\nthe US Congress for this\npro-democracy protest.\nParagraph 8 states:\n\u201cAnyone who is familiar\nwith the Basic Law and\nits complexities can see\nthat Hong Kong is an indivisible part of China.\u201d\nWhat the writer failed\nto mention is that later\non in the very same set\nof laws, it is promised\nthat the Chief Executive\nof the Hong Kong government shall ultimately\nbe elected by the people\nwith universal suffrage.\nThat could not be further\nfrom the political system\nin Hong Kong right now.\nThe people only want as\nmuch - for everyone to\nhave the basic right to\nchoose their own leader,\nfor everyone to have\nthe basic right to vote.\nIt seems ironic that the\nwriter accuses those\nwith opposing views\nof unfamiliarity with\nthe Basic Law when\nthey themselves merely\ncherry-picked a section\nthat supported their own\nview.\nOn top of all the\ncensorship and police\nviolence, Hong Kong\u2019s\ndemocracy is also\nbeing ever-corrupted\nby puppets of the\nChinese Communist\nParty. Joshua Wong,\nthe founder of the\npro-democracy activist\ngroup Scholarism and\nthe secretary-general\nof the political party\nDemosist\u014d, was recently\nbanned from running in\nthe upcoming district\ncouncil election. This\nis a clear obstruction of\npolitical freedom and,\nagain, a step in further\ntaking away the self-de-termination of all Hong\nKongers.\nWhen the police resort\nto murder, who do you\ncall? When your government turns on you, who\ndo you rely on? When\nyour democracy is being\ntaken away from you,\nyou must take a stand.\nFelix welcomes all\nstudent opinions on\nthis or any other issue.\nIf you want your voice\nheard, whether to agree\nor disagree, contact\nthe Comment editors at\ncomment.felix@imperial.\nac.uk\nThe original article\n\u2018An Opinion on the Hong\nKong Issue\u2019 is available\nin our PDF issue archive\nat felixonline.co.uk\n\u201c... in what\nreality is\nrespect\ntowards a flag\na greater issue\nthan one\u2019s\nfuture and\nfreedom?\u201d\nPolice violence // Flickr: Studio Incendo\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1733\nFELIX\n7\nPUZZLES fsudoku@imperial.ac.uk\nA CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk\nthe potential need to\nchange those roles very\nshortly after new staff\njoin?\nTom: The Student Activities Manager, Iain Pullar,\nhas been working on this\nsort of thing \u2013 less me.The\nnew Head of Student Experience, Tom Newman,\nhas come in now and so\nwe\u2019re also looking at the\ndirectorate as a whole,\nwhich can affect things on\na Union-wide scale.\nWe\u2019ve found ourselves in\nthe situation where we do\nnot understand everything\nthat we do, and the current\nstructure hopefully is an\nimprovement. It doesn\u2019t\nmean a restructuring, it\u2019s\nabout looking at efficien-cies. That might require\nnew staff to learn new\nskills, that weren\u2019t in their\noriginal job descriptions \u2013\nbut the major stakeholder,\nand our major focus, is\nthe students. We need\npeople in those posts.\nWe\u2019re hoping to hire\npeople who are really\ninterested by the things\nthey\u2019ll be doing, with the\nright mindset, who will\nput students first \u2013 and\nthus will be on board with\nimproving these efficien-cies. We definitely will\nkeep all of this in mind,\nand will support them.\nWe don\u2019t do that enough\nas it is \u2013 we have high\nstaff turnover. It would be\nshort-sighted to say it\u2019s\njust as a result of being\na Union, and we want to\nbe an exceptional place\nto work so people want to\nstay, and we\u2019re not there\nyet. We can do things like\ntraining and giving staff a\nsense of joint ownership\nwith students over their\nprojects. We need to\nempower staff to deliver\nthe vision we have, so we\ncan do our job \u2013 which I\nsee as facilitate student\nactivities.\nStudents can do a bunch\nof stuff better than we\ncan, Imperial students are\nsmart and capable \u2013 we\nshould facilitate that with\nsystems development,\nprocesses, consultation,\nrather than \u2018providing a\nservice\u2019. My involvement\nwith CSPs has aided\nand complemented my\nacademic experience at\nuni, and my professional\nfuture, and I hope other\nstudents in CSPs would\nagree.\nFelix: Okay. So what\u2019s\nhappening with Ethos\n\u2013 a new gym has been\nopened downstairs, and\nstudents are confused\nabout whether they will\nbe charged to use it or\nnot. Can we get some\nclarity? Why was there\nsuch confusion in the\nway it was communicat-ed?\nHere, Tom offered a\ndetailed explanation\nof the new structure of\nspecifically sports clubs\nin the Union, the Sports\nHub, Move Imperial, the\nCollege\u2019s Sports Board,\nand other related organ-isations. For more infor-mation, see papers from\nlast year\u2019s Union Council.\nTom: A new CrossFit gym\ncalled SW7 was opened on\nthe ground floor, and was\nfunded by the President\u2019s\nFund. What the email said\n\u201cthe gym is specifically\nrun as a functional class\nprogram with four main\nconcepts, as well as being\nopen to existing members\noutside of the program.\u201d\nThe members it\u2019s referring to are not the SW7\nmembers, it\u2019s members of\nEthos. So if you have the\nmembership to the gym at\nEthos, you do get access\nto SW7 with no further\nfees \u2013 but you don\u2019t have\naccess to the classes or the\nMyZone technology. For\nthose things specifically,\nyou have to pay \u00a350 a\nmonth, which I believe\nis open to the public as\nwell like Ethos is. So it is\nan extra gym space being\nprovided at no extra cost\nto students, so long as\nclasses are not being run\nin there at the time.\nMove Imperial have\nrecently told me that since\nopening SW7, they\u2019ve\nonly had waiting times\nat Ethos once as students\nwill just go to SW7 when\nEthos is full. Before that,\nwait times were a regular\nproblem. It\u2019s a really\npositive improvement.\nThe wording of the email\ncould have been better,\nbut hopefully this clears\nit up!\nFelix: The new structure\nof the Sports Hub and\nMove Imperial and how\nthese decision-making\nstructures are set up\nseems to be quite confusing to students thus far.\nDo you feel it\u2019s obscuring clarity about, for\nexample, who to contact\nabout problems or where\nfunding is coming from?\nTom: The Sports Hub is\na project that\u2019s still being\nphased in, and we\u2019re\nstill figuring out a lot of\nthe logistics, like how\nfinancially it will work.\nIt won\u2019t be clear right\nnow. The idea is to have\na parallel structure to the\nold CSPB specifically for\nsports clubs. The papers\nsubmitted to Council\nlast year give example\nstructures \u2013 which are\nnot set in stone, but are\ncurrently being looked\nat. For example, we now\nhave management groups\nfor different sports clubs,\nsuch as Martial Arts or\nTeam Court. It\u2019s the same\nvolunteers doing these\nroles, but creating a new\nparallel structure to facilitate their needs better\nand work efficiently with\nMove Imperial to do that.\nSo as an example of what\nwe\u2019re looking at with\nthe phasing \u2013 which is\noverseen by meetings of\nthe old CSPB structure \u2013\nis that if we make massive\nsavings with the Sports\nHub structure, do they\nneed the same amount of\nfunding for it and if so\nhow can that funding then\nbe fairly redistributed?\nSo hopefully I can talk\nmore about it next time\nwe do an interview!\nFelix: What else have you\nbeen working on?\nTom: One thing is the first\npoint of my manifesto,\nwhich is looking at the\nnew sports complex \u2013 spe-cifically, working with the\nCollege on consultation\nabout Heston and Harlington. So, the College\n\u2013 specifically Campus\nServices \u2013 are conducting\na review of their facilities\nacross campuses. They\u2019ve\nlooked at Heston and\nHarlington, the main\nsports grounds, and think\nthat Heston is not fit for\npurpose and are considering selling it.\nThey\u2019re really keen this\nyear, after it hasn\u2019t been\ndone at other times, to\nconsult with students\nabout this sort of decision\n\u2013 and they said that the\nsale wouldn\u2019t go ahead\nwithout student agree-ment. We held a joint\nconsultation workshop\nwith Move Imperial, and\nall the clubs who use the\nspace got an individual\ninvite along with all the\nclubs in general receiving\nan open invitation, along\nwith other representa-tives.\nThe facilities at Harlington have been renewed\nto the tune of around\n\u00a3700,000 over the last\nyear, including renovating pitches, improving\nchanging rooms, and so\non. They\u2019re steps in the\nright direction and there\u2019s\na strong desire to see it\nthrough and continue\nimproving Harlington.\nThe sale of Heston would\nmean a lot of teams\nshifting to Harlington, as\nwell, and there have been\nissues with more clubs\nbeing at Harlington \u2013 for\nexample, Heston had\nbetter football pitches.\nThe feedback was that so\nlong as there is investment into Harlington,\nthere isn\u2019t a strong feeling\nagainst selling Heston \u2013\nthere isn\u2019t a sentimental\nattachment as such. But\nit will be a big ongoing\nproject, including looking\nat things like transport\nstrategies for students to\nget there.\nFelix: That\u2019s very\npositive to hear. This\nall touches \u2013 almost\neverything we have\ntalked about \u2013 on\nthe space problem at\nImperial, which we\u2019ve\ncovered a lot this\nyear. What are your\nthoughts on moving to\na multi-campus univer-sity, and how this might\naffect both CSP communities as well as logistical\noperation of the Union\nas a whole?\nTom: It\u2019s an interesting question and one\nwe maybe do not ask\nourselves enough. I\u2019m\nleading a project looking\ninto the space that CSPs\nuse, and it\u2019s huge \u2013 it\u2019s\nfunded by the Harlington\nTrust, and involves people\nat the College as well.\nThis might be something\nto be looked at there.\nFelix: You were talking\nabout how much CSPs\nbenefitted you \u2013 so I\u2019m\nasking, what are your\nfeelings about it? For\nexample, the idea of\nhaving a DPCS for each\ncampus, or having CSPs\nbe fragmented between\ndifferent campuses.\nTom: As DPCS I think\nit\u2019s really exciting! There\nare a lot of potential that\nwould come with having\nmultiple campuses,\nalthough there would also\nbe great challenges. With\nthe new Head of Student\nExperience, we\u2019re\nmeeting with key student\nvolunteers from different\nmanagement groups and\neven down to the level of\nspecific CSPs that operate\nin unique ways \u2013 such\nas Felix \u2013 over the next\nfew weeks to talk about\nvarious things. One\nquestion we are asking\nis whether people have\na sense of community at\nImperial, and what you\nfind is that within constituent unions they find it\nin the constituent union,\nwithin clubs it\u2019s in their\nclub, and so on. So you\nraise a good point \u2013 for\na lot of people maybe it\nwould affect their sense\nof community. For some\nclubs \u2013 such as those\nwhich operate out of \u2018core\nhours\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s maybe less of\na problem.\nWe need to look at how\nwe deal with things like\ntransport and communication across campuses,\nas often right now we\nare quite South Kensington-focused, and that\nmodularity is something\nI began this interview by\nnoting as a problem. That\napplies even now, with\nother campuses that we\ndon\u2019t do enough to work\nwith, and we\u2019ll have to\nlook at those problems\ntoo when we tackle White\nCity.\nWe need more of a\npresence in these other\ncampuses. Even right\nnow, we have some\npresence in for example\nReynolds, but I don\u2019t\nthink that\u2019s enough. I\u2019m\nplanning to work there\nonce every two or three\nweeks to get involved, get\nto know people, and get\nto grips with their specific\nissues \u2013 whereas right\nnow we\u2019re dependent on\nthat structure feeding in,\nrather than personally\nhaving a presence.\nFelix: Do you think the\nway things are set up\nwith the medics right\nnow \u2013 for example,\nhaving a full-time\nsabbatical officer specifically to address many\nof their unique issues\nas they\u2019re often spread\nacross other campuses\n\u2013 might be a model\nto emulate? Having a\n\u201cWhite City\u201d sabbatical\nofficer, for example?\nTom: It depends on\nwhether the needs at different campuses are very\ndifferent. Like, currently\nSilwood have their own\nstructures that then feed in\nto the centralised Union,\nso perhaps that would\nwork.\n\n"
