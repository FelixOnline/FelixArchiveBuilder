According to TfL,\nthe key was misplaced by an employee\ntwo weeks ago during the \u2018daily scrum\ncall\u2019. Station staff have been unable to\nget back into the subway since, causing\nmass confusion amongst Natural History\nMuseum fans.\n\u201cDerek is always fucking doing this,\u201d\nsaid a fellow TfL employee who wished\nto remain anonymous. \u201cLast year he\ntook the station teddy bear with him\non holiday to Sharm El-Sheikh to take\npictures for show-and-tell, and we\u2019re still\nin an ongoing custody battle with the\nEgyptian authorities after he left it in the\nswimming pool bar. Apparently \u2018finders\nkeepers\u2019 has been codified into Egyptian\nlaw since the reign of Ramses II\u201d.\nExperimental physicists at Felix have\ncalculated that walking from the station\nto campus now takes an estimated 36.67\nseconds longer than it did previously,\ndue to the disruption. Local students\nand museum-goers aren\u2019t the only\npeople affected by the key loss. Speaking\nto Felix last Friday, the president of\nthe Union of Annoyingly Loud Guitar\nGuys (UALGG) Beff Jeck said, \u201cThis is\nreally the nail in the coffin for Sadiq\nKhan. Our union members have been\nforced to busk outside, where the lack\nof enclosing walls makes their playing\nactually bearable for the human ear. The\nnumber of people paying us to shut up\nhas dwindled to almost zero.\u201d Jeck has\nsince tweeted that the UALGG would be\nseeking compensation from TfL and the\nMayor of London for the disruption.\nThe loss of the key is the latest in a\nseries of disruptions to TfL services since\nthe announcement of funding issues\nrelatingtotheMayor\u2019sexpansionofULEZ.\nMr Khan, however, has told journalists\nthat he has listened to criticism and is\nexpected to announce HE/SHE/ITLEZ,\nTHEYLEZ, WELEZ and U(PLURAL)LEZ in\nthe run-up to next year\u2019s election.\nCATNIP\nKey to South Kensington\nTube Station remains lost\nLIBRA SCORPIO SAGITTARIUS CAPRICORN AQUARIUS PISCES\nARIES TAURUS GEMINI CANCER LEO VIRGO\nThis week the landlord\ntells you it isn\u2019t mould.\nThis week your boyfriend\nsplitwises the flowers he\nbought you.\nThis week you call the\nflat\u2019s decision to switch to\nbranded soap \u201can orgy of\nnarcissism\u201d.\nThis week Sadiq Khan\nannounces that bed bugs\nare not ULEZ compliant.\nThis week on\nRemembrance Day you\nremember that time you\nwent for the hug.\nThis week two boys in a\ntrenchcoat are revealed\nto be four stoats in\nsmaller trenchcoats.\nThis week you hook up\nwith the wrong type of\ncougar.\nThis week you swap out\nthe garlic in a recipe for\nscrambled egg.\nThis week you are\nslightly too fascist for\nyour Hinge date.\nThis week you go back to\nWhite History Month.\nThis week you get invited to\na crypto conference.

The street was roughly\n50 meters long and five meters wide, we\nwere bordered by little shops filled with\nantiques, maps, and precious old books.\nFor a moment, we had discovered the\n1930s.\nDespite it being 6:30pm on a Saturday, all the shops were closed, much to\nour dismay. However, there was one tiny\nstore, with a sign reading \u2018OPEN\u2019 that\ngave us a glimpse of hope. We pushed\nopen the locked door and the owner \u2013 a\nyoung man \u2013 came to our aid. \u201cAre you\nopen?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo not really, but I still\nhave to do some things so you two are\nmore than welcome to take a look.\u201d We\nentered with gratified smiles.\nThe petite store was filled with books\ndating back to the 1920s, at least five dozen copies of the earlier editions of Alice\nin Wonderland, and poetry books that\nwould be cancelled in our generation.\nEach shelf had the same sign: \u2018Please\nhandle with two hands\u2019, to avoid breaking the books. My friend relived some of\nhis childhood literature, while I smiled\nat seeing an old copy of Brothers\u2019 Grimm\nStories \u2013 a classic from my home country\nof Germany. A thin book called Ruthless\nRhymes was filled with six-verse poems\nof dark humor. Accidents, decapitations,\nstabbings \u2013 all portrayed in a humorous\nfashion.\nThe first page of all the books we\nopened included notes from the original owner \u2013 a birthday gift from an aunt\nto her niece in 1954, for example. Prices\nwere noted there as well \u2013 ranging from\na hefty \u00a330 to \u00a380 for rare first editions.\nOnce the owner closed the store, we\nmoved on to the only other store with its\nlights on: a map store. It too was closed,\nso we instead perused the maps through\nthe windows.\nThey were all of the London Underground in various time periods, and we\nlearnt a few interesting facts: Gloucester\nRoad, which I used to pronounce as \u201cGlochess-ester\u201d used to be spelt \u2018Gloster\u2019.\nThere were many more stations along the\nPiccadilly Line than there are now, such\nas \u2018Brompton Road\u2019 between South Kensington and Knightsbridge. Nonetheless,\nit was wonderful to see that the lines had\nnot changed colors or names over the\npast century, showcasing the wonderful\nconsistency in our transport system.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001f\u0016\u0015\u001a\u0014\u0017\u001a\u0019\u0017\u001f\u0016\u0015\u001a\u0014\u0017\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\nFOOD&TRAVEL\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001e\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001c\u001a\u0015\u0014\u0019\u0018\u001b\nCecil Court has\ntreasurers of first\nedition books\nand classic old\nmaps.\n\u001e\nast weekend my friend told me about her friend-date with her roommate in Chelsea, which involved\ntaking a safari around London\u00b4s culinary jungle,\neating one course at each restaurant. Coincidentally, on\nthat same weekend, another friend and I had dinner at\nChipotle and desserts at Covent Garden\u00b4s Burmese restaurant Lahpet. The concept \u2013 which sounds exhausting\nand almost as dubious as skip-lagging \u2013 is adventurous in its explorative nature. If well-planned, a restaurant safari allows you to try a bit of everything in a very\nsmall-time frame.\nDepending on budget and time frame, one can organise pre-dinner drinks at an outside bar while the\nsun still shines, appetizers at a tapas place, main dishes at any restaurant you fancy, dessert from a bakery,\nand post-dinner drinks at a rooftop bar. With a slightly smaller budget, you can eat larger meals at cheaper\nplaces to get your money\u2019s worth and enjoy a long talk\nwith an overpriced cocktail in a sultry, exotically-deco-rated bar overlooking the Thames.\nSimilar concepts already exist in our society. All Imperialstudentswhosurvivedfreshers\u2019weekknowofpub\ncrawls \u2013 but instead of beer, you enjoy different dishes.\nBoth the cultures of pre-drinking before heading out\nfor a night of clubbing and of indulging in pre-dinner\ncocktails in a lavish hotel bar opposite the restaurant\ndemonstrate this desire for options. Ice cream after dinner at a nearby gelateria and Japanese souffle pancakes\nat Hefaure are other post-dinner rituals I have tried in\nLondon. The idea of splitting meals into smaller meals\nat different places due to incompatibilities may also resonate with athletes and vegan, coeliac, and halal eaters\nalike.\nBecause of all these intricacies, this does not necessarily sound fun for every dinner. Considering the strictness of London\u2019s reservation-only customs and the lack\nof free space in most restaurants at weekends, meticulous planning is required. You could also just wander\naround and take your chances, but in either case, it is a\ngreat new way to explore more of the different cuisines\nthat London so famously has on offer.\nUntil next time,\nCharlotte.\n\u0013\u0014\u0014\u0017\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001e\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001c\u001a\u0015\u0014\u0019\u0018\u001b\nA central London safari\nis unheard of \u2013 except\nin the abstract sense.\n\u0013\u0012\u0017\u0011\u0010\u001a\u0015\u0016\u0011\u0017\u000f\u001c\u0016\u0017\u0014\u001a\u001e\u0019\u0011\u000e\u0017\u001b \u0016\u0019\u0017 \u001e\u0019 \u001e\u0019\u0017\u001a\u0011\u0017\n\u000f\u0017\u0011\u000f\u0012\u000f\u001c\u001a\nFOOD&TRAVEL |\nFOOD&TRAVEL |\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001e\u001d\n\u001e\u001d\nAdazing.com\nrawpixel.com\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial Editorial | 3\nISSUE #1832\nA breath of fresh air\nEDITORIAL\nI\nn this issue, Felix talks to the Union\u2019s new Deputy President (Education), Yi Yang.\nSpeaking to Yang, it is clear that the common\ntheme running through almost all of her goals for\nthe year is an earnest desire to improve the interna-tional-student experience.\nMore so than any of the other Officer Trustees\n(OTs) the paper has interviewed thus far, Yang\u2019s\nplans arise almost entirely from her own experiences as an overseas student. It just so happens that\nthose experiences resonate with much of the student population \u2013 overseas students comprise nearly half of the student body, and Chinese students\nsuch as Yang account for a quarter of this.\nFor the past few years, international students\nhave had their specific concerns sidelined in favour\nof broader objectives that benefit all students. For\nthis year at least, that will not be the case.\nYang has assembled a triad of policies that target\nwhat she sees as the biggest issues facing international students.\nPoor English skills, she feels, hinder both the academic performance and the social lives of internationals \u2013 especially those from China.\nShe is therefore working with the centre for Academic English to promote its courses and remove\nthe stigma around seeking its support. She hopes\nthat a new \u2018Social English\u2019 course the Centre is running will help address the shyness and accompanying loneliness faced by some internationals.\nSuch work will serve home students as well. As\ndiscussed in a Comment piece last issue, every\nEnglish-speaking student knows the frustration that\ncomes with having to rewrite a group report, or battle to explain a concept to those whose language\nskills are lacking.\nAt first glance, the remaining two policies in\nYang\u2019s triad do not address the international student\nexperience. She intends i) to improve the postgraduate student experience, strengthening postgrad\nengagement with the Union, and ii) to provide \u2018professional training\u2019 for student representatives.\nBut Yang explains that 70% of postgraduate\ntaught students are international students \u2013 many\nof them here for only one year. Such students, she\nsays, engage little with the Union and with those\noutside of their own communities.\nHer plan to provide professional training for student representatives is as much a means to achieving greater engagement with postgraduates as it is a\ngoal in its own right. Properly trained student representatives will be empowered to relay the concerns\nof their cohorts to the Union. This will give the Union\na better picture of how it can support postgrads.\nYang has one further goal, that sits somewhat\napart from the triad above. Again, it stems from her\nown personal convictions: she wants to \u2018standardise\nUROP applications\u2019.\nIn contrast to her other broad policies, appealing\nto a large constituent of the student body, her UROP\ngoals are decidedly narrow in scope\nUROPs \u2013 Imperial\u2019s research internships for undergraduates \u2013 are clearly of personal significance\nto Yang. But fewer than one in four Imperial undergrads go on to research careers.\nPerhaps there is a case to be made for standard-ising UROP applications, but by pursuing this goal,\nYang is sacrificing time that would be better spent\non more pressing problems.\nTake for example Imperial\u2019s lowest scoring area\non the National Student Survey, and Postgraduate\nTaught Experience Survey: assessment and feed-back. Both students and academics across the\nboard complain that the burden of assessment is\ntoo high, and that feedback to students is inconsistent and varies in quality.\nOr the marking and assessment boycotts, which\ncontinue to affect second and third year students,\neven after the industrial action has come to an end.\nSome are still yet to receive their grades from last\nyear.\nUltimately, Yang\u2019s focus on international students\nis a breath of fresh air \u2013 badly needed and long over-due. It will mean a year in which the wider student\nbody does not receive as much attention from the\nDPE as it is used to. But overseas and postgraduate\nstudents will finally see their concerns represented\nin the sometimes-insular world of Union politics.\n\n"

It\ngenerates an air of certain mystery surrounding\nwhat she says with, quite metaphorically, a white\nfog. More statedly, it points to an uncommon knowledge\nabout words, and language overall, that she would probably refute me as saying she has.\nThis builds an image of Oyeyemi as possessing a series of esoteric qualities, idiosyncrasies, that have come\nto be adored over her 18-year career in fiction, and built\nin the fabulism genre a street that bears her. It proves\nstorytelling is not merely a product, but a part of her\nbeing. It presents her as an appropriate candidate to deliver the New Statesman/Goldsmiths Prize lecture at the\nLondon Literature Festival this year.\nThe function of this Prize lecture is to reminiscence\non the novel as a form of writing, to contemplate on its\nexistence, and macroscopic purpose. The vultures are\nsaid to be on their way (either the novel has yet to fulfil\nits decade-spanning death or the vultures are, as it just\nhappens, slow), and the novel is in need of the people\nwilling to offer it a diagnosis, or at worse, prognosis.\nNevertheless, the New Statesman/Goldsmiths Prize Lecture provides an opportunity to convene masters of the\ncraft to Southbank Centre every year, and deliver, to an\nobservant audience, their thoughts.\nFor Oyeyemi, the title of these reflection is \u2018Trying\u2019.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m going to do is make a series of comments and\nsee if you agree\u201d, she states at the beginning. Her flair\nfor the unabashedly self-aware calls for more applause,\nthan just appreciation, if anything.\nHelen Oyeyemi, born in Nigeria and raised in London,\nattending the Cardinal Vaughn Memorial School (in the\nnearby Holland Park) received an advance from Bloomsbury for her first novel, The Icarus Girl, written while\nshe was studying for her A-Levels. These just-stated five\nfacts about her life were taken from Wikipedia, a website she says (in an answer to a member of the audience)\nshe had once tried to delete entries of herself in its early\ndays, upon learning of their existence. \u201cI think there is\na certain freedom that you can feel just from being an\nunknown element,\u201d she reflects, adding \u201cbut also [\u2026] I\nguess it\u2019s not possible.\u201d\nShe conveys a useful ambiguity. Like there is some\nunknown variable that she would rather keep constant,\na characteristic she would think should be shared by\neveryone. In a contemporary, digital sense of the word,\nshe carries an \u2018aesthetic\u2019.\nThe Icarus Girl, about an eight-year-old girl\nconfronting a haunting doppelganger, was a\nfreshman omen of her fabulousness. (\u2018Fabulous\u2019, originating from the Latin fabula,\nmeaning fable.) A review of her most\nrecent work, Peaces, published in The\nGuardian begins \u201cHelen Oyeyemi\nis a bamboozler, a discombobu-lator, a peddler of perplexity\u201d.\nOther novels contain murderous animal-named writers falling in love with their muses,\nand the greed and corruption\nof gingerbread politics\n(to say it vaguely). The\nbook I currently possess , Boy, Snow, Bird,\nreworks Snow White\nwithin 1950s Massachusetts. To be direct, she\ntells stories. She posits, early in\nthe lecture, a question to the hard realists among us, or\n\u201cfictioneers whose metaphysical pragmatism prevents\nthem from considering them escapists first\u201d: what distinction exists between reality, and the impossibility of\nescape? And if one is to be found, she asks, why then\nare we, as a collective, interested the novel form, sitting\nthere before ink-filled pieces of paper for hours on end?\nIt seems fitting the fable has endured as an art form\nto portray the plain truth to us. For the outlandish to be\nmade to construe the real. In this edition of the Prize\nlecture, Helen Oyeyemi makes convincing arguments\nfor the imaginative and for imagination. She calls upon\nupon Franz Kafka and C\u00e9sar Aira, helping her craft\nsongs of praise out of a supposed eulogy. The title, \u2018Trying\u2019, comes out of a bookmark with the words \u2018You\u2019re\nstill trying\u2019 written on it. It is placed in her copy of\n1936 novel Korn\u00e9l Esti by Dezs\u0151 Kosztol\u00e1nyi. She\nhighlights the crux of storytelling in our everyday lives, when we ourselves are occasionally\nunable to pinpoint its significance. In many\nways in the Prize lecture, she is commending the role of the writer. In far more,\nhowever, she commends you, the read-er, reading this right now.\nTo its end.\nThe fabulous\nart of trying\nHelen Oyeyemi delivers the New\nStatesman/Goldsmiths Prize\nLecture, in this year\u2019s London\nLiterature Festival.\nBooksEditor\nFIYINFOLUWA T.

On a\ngiven topic, the best teacher is often not the smartest\nperson, but instead someone who is enough of a layman\nto it that they understand which parts of an explanation\nrequire more elaboration and hand-holding.\nA recent example of this juxtaposition emerged with\nthe publishing of the paper \u2018Assembly theory explains\nand quantifies selection and evolution\u2019 in the science\njournal Nature. In the article, Abhishek Sharma, a\nchemist at the University of Glasgow, and his colleagues\nproposed assembly theory (AT) as a way of \u2018reconciling\nbiological evolution with the immutable\nlaws of the Universe defined by physics\u2019,\nthrough some creative reimagining of how\n\u2018objects\u2019 are conceptualised. In contrast to other\nsimilarly ambitious and high-concept theories that\nhave been published in Nature, the common response\nto AT, at least on X (formerly Twitter), was one of\nconfusion and even ridicule. The paper was described as\nincoherent and pseudoscientific, its conceit either too\ncomplicated and mired in its own argumentation or too\nsimplistic that it need not even warrant its own paper.\nThis isn\u2019t to suggest that AT is necessarily wrong or\ninvalid; it wouldn\u2019t have made it past six world-class\nscientists and Nature\u2019s editorial team if it didn\u2019t hold\nsome value. The paper most certainly makes complete\nand utter sense to the authors \u2014 both in terms of\nits internal logic, and in its contribution to the field\nof the philosophy of biology. But what the reactions\nsuggest is that there was, at the very least, an almost\nfundamental mismatch between what the researchers\nintended to convey and what their audience\nunderstood; a failure to consider the thought processes\nof those reading the paper.\nTake the first sentence of the abstract: \u2018Scientists have\ngrappled with reconciling biological evolution with the\nimmutable laws of the Universe defined by physics.\u2019\nWhat does this even mean? What does reconciling\nmean. and why is this something we have to reconcile?\nThe authors describe the incongruity, with respect to\nhow both disciplines deal with the idea of \u2018function\u2019,\nbut do not explain why this is a problem worth solving.\nMaybe they didn\u2019t see this as something that required\nexplanation! It takes an insightful mind to come up with\na theory which resolves a fundamental conflict between\ntwo huge scientific disciplines, but perhaps even more\nvaluable than that is knowing what a reader needs to\nfully grasp that insight.\nIt\u2019s hard to fault these specific authors, considering\nthey\u2019re not trained writers \u2013 they\u2019re researchers, who\nseem to have tunnelled too far into their niche. This is\nwhere editors play a crucial role, acting as a substitute\nfor the layman and bringing researchers\u2019 ideas down to\nearth. All publications have their own style guides, part\nof which is always dedicated to making writing more\naccessible. And perhaps these rules do iron out some\nfolds, making a piece easier to read! But, they don\u2019t\nmake up for explanations that are actually empathetic\nto the audience.\nAll style, no substance\nThe Nature News & Views section contains short-form\nsummaries of research papers, with the express goal\nof being readable by anyone with a bachelor\u2019s degree,\neven in an unrelated field. For example, the News\n& Views piece \u2018Immune treatment tackles chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease\u2019 meticulously\ncondenses the original NEJM article into two pages and\ndiligently follows the style guide, defining eosinophils\nand cytokines.

Her\nname is rather fitting, given her\ngoals as Deputy President (Education). Yi\n(pronounced \u2018ee\u2019), means wings, and Yang\n(pronounced \u2018young\u2019), means Sun. She\ntells me her name comes from her parents\u2019\nexpectationsofher:\u2018thatIcanfreelydevelop\nmyself under whatever environment I\u2019m in.\u2019\nYang was born in Shenzhen, Guangdong\nProvince. She spent her early years there in\nChina\u2019s public school system before moving\nto Hong Kong for her secondary education,\nattending an international school.\nShenzhen is itself a sprawling metropolis\n\u2013 communist China\u2019s first experiment with\nmarket capitalism. But Hong Kong is one of\nthe world\u2019s foremost financial hubs and has\na culture distinct to that of mainland China\n\u2013 until 1997, it was a British colony.\nYang says the move to Hong Kong\n\u201cbroadened [her] horizons\u201d .\n\u201cMoving to Hong Kong, I had to get used\nto talking to different people, seeing even\nsmall differences in living conditions and\nculture across the border.\u201d\nNevertheless, relocating to London to\nstudy at Imperial was a dramatic change.\nYang is studying for an MSci in Geophysics\n(\u201ca really interesting degree, because so few\npeople at Imperial know it exists\u201d, she says\nsarcastically).\nShe tells me that her department was\nvery welcoming, and describes her cohort\nas \u201cfamily\u201d. \u201cThe senior tutors were really\nkind to me when I had any difficulties \u2013\nthey were good people to talk to and would\nsignpost you to different services.\u201d\nIn her year group, 30 to 40 of the 90\ngeophysicists were Chinese international\nstudents. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really feel like we had a\nbarrier,\u201d she says, explaining how she made\nfriends with a home student who helped\nintroduce her to other locals.\nYang acknowledges that this is not the\nexperience of all international students,\nsaying she is fortunate that there was \u201cthat\nkind of character happy to be a bridge\u201d.\nIndeed, she ran for Deputy President\n(Education) on a campaign that focused\nalmost entirely on bettering the\ninternational student experience.\nYang\u2019s goals\nYang lists four goals for the year:\n1. Introduce language support courses for non-native English speakers.\n2. Strengthen postgraduate student\nengagement with Imperial College\nUnion (ICU), and discuss changes\nto the \u2018mutual expectation\u2019 documents to guarantee the quality of\nresearch support for postgraduate\nresearch students (PGRs).\n3. Provide professional training for\nstudent representatives.\n4. Standardise the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme\n(UROP) application process, and\nsecuring further UROP funding.\nShe tells a story to explain her first\ngoal. \u201cI came from the Chinese public\nschool system. The academic pressure\nwas crazy high, and it started in primary\nschool \u2013 we\u2019d be in school from 9am to\n5pm, with six lectures a day from the very\nbeginning.\u201d\n\u201cEverything got assessed \u2013 even PE and\nArt (okay, Art maybe not). But all hobbies\n\u2013 even art and music were seen as a path\nto a better future from early education\nonwards. Everything you learn is to help\nyou get a better future.\u201d\n\u201cWe were pushed to study hard, because we were told that if you are lazy\nfor even a day, then everyone will outrun\nyou, and you will not be able to catch up.\u201d\n\u201cWith this kind of pressure, I was expecting exactly the same, or maybe even\nmore ferocious competition at Imperial.\u201d\nYang says that while she does not feel\nthere is a social barrier between home\nand international students, \u201cone thing\nwe are different on is hobbies.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of the Chinese or Asian students\nI run into are eager to get work done in\nthe library, and then enjoy Fridays and\nweekends. They start to revise in the\nmiddle of term or early in the holidays.\u201d\n\u201cSo that competitive environment I\nmentioned earlier does exist for some\nAsians and international students at Imperial.\u201d\nDespite all this effort, Yang observed\nthat the grades of international students\nwere not significantly better than those\nof home students.\nThis raised a question in her mind: \u201cDo\nwe actually need to build this ferocious at-mosphere? Maybe we can study and learn\nin a more welcome, warmer environment,\nwithout getting too competitive.\u201d\nFor Yang, building this welcoming environment starts with her first goal for\nthe year: addressing language and communication problems.\nYang\u2019s election campaign said she\nwould \u2018lobby to introduce English-as-aSecond-Language courses\u2019 for non-native\nspeakers. But upon assuming the DPE\nrole, and talking to the Centre for Academic English (CfAE), she has come to the\nconclusion that the existing provision is\nsufficient.\nHowever, she feels there is a stigma\naround using the service, admitting that\nshe herself was embarrassed to use the\nsupport available.\n\u201cI was ashamed to join [CfAE courses],\nbecause I\u2019d have to let my friends know\nthat two or three years into my degree,\nI was accepting language support. Even\nmy parents told me, \u2018You\u2019ve been there for\nthree years. There is no way you still have\nproblems writing and communicating.\u201d\nShe is keen to outline the importance\nof such support in improving international students\u2019 grades. \u201cWe are intellectually at the same level, it\u2019s just that language support is going to boost us that\nlittle bit and put us on a level footing.\u201d\nFurthermore, she hopes that it will go\nsome way to addressing the loneliness\nfelt by international students away from\nhome.\nThis year, she intends to promote the\nexisting CfAE service to students, and to\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nIn this series, Felix talks to the\nUnion\u2019s Officer Trustees.

The air was brisk\nas I strolled along the vast expanse of\ngrassland near the park\u2019s Pen Pond, flipping logs one after another. My mission,\nuneventful for too long, turned into such\nmechanic repetition, that this vaguely\nraptilian face, half-buried in the sand, did\nnot catch the slightest of my attention.\nPlacing the log back, it only took seconds\nfor me to realise that I had found Britain\u2019s\ncommonest native reptile. Eagerly, I lifted the wood up again to reveal the lizard\nwhich, in a sluggish state, was still puzzled from the disturbance, looking about\nitself on alert. I recorded a short video of\nit running into the grass, and decided to\ngive the raptilian friend no more hassle.\nSince then, I have encountered this\nlizard\u2019s kind all across the south, in different sizes, shapes and colours, but with\none thing in common \u2013 all I ever see is a\nbrief flash of brown or grey as it makes a\nbeeline for the nearest surrounding vege-tation. Even when under a piece of wood,\nas the ape and the lizard sized each other\nup, it was always lizard that triumphed.\nOnce, I almost to picked it up, but it managed to slip through my fingers and gave\nup its tail, a defensive strategy employed\nby many lizards called caudal autotomy.\nKneeling over a fallen log with a writhing lizard tail in my hands, I could only\nENVIRONMENT\nViviparous\nlizard: the\nslippery little\nspeedster\nEnvironmentWriter\nSHREYAS KUCHIBHOTLA\nThe shed tail of a Viviparous lizard at Richmond Park, London, 2023.

We continue this with the\nviviparous lizard.\nseethe at this scaly Houdini who got the\nbetter of me, again.\nLizards are flighty. They have to be. In\nmost places (perhaps not so ecologically\nstarved as Britain), a walk in a rocky area\non a sunny morning will show plenty of\nmotion as hundreds of lizards flee from\ntheir basking spots at the first sight of\ndanger. This is a natural response \u2013 most\nlizards are quite far down on the food\nchain, frequently snacked on by mam-mals, birds, snakes and even large arthro-pods, such as tarantulas and centipedes.\nAs a result, their brief stints up on the\nrocks to absorb warmth are fraught with\ndanger. For raptiles, basking is not for leisure \u2013 it is an unfortunate requirement\nby their anatomy that places them in constant danger by allowing themselves to\nstay exposed. Many have evolved to make\ntheir sunbathing safer. Some snakes (also\nunder the family of lizards) practise mosaic basking, with only parts of their body\nplaced in direct sunlight with the rest\nhidden in order to avoid being spotted.\nThe viviparous lizard, or simply referred\nto as common lizard, is coloured in drab\nshades of brown, with light and dark\nmarkings that mimic the appearance of\ndry scrub. This gives them an advantage\nwhen basking, making it harder for predators to locate them visually and allowing\nthemselves more time to dive into the undergrowth (and of course, sacrifice their\ntail if necessary). Many times I have been\nwithin a few inches of a lizard without\nnoticing it until it moved. Good for them,\nI suppose. Not so good for me.\nViviparous lizards are also interesting\nfor their reproductive behaviour \u2014 both\nthe Greek generic name Zootoka and the\nLatin specific name vivipara, mean \u201clive\nbirth\u201d, as they give birth to live young,\nas opposed to most of the raptilian family which hatch from eggs. Young viviparous lizards, tiny and almost black, are\nvery different in appearance from their\nparents, making them hard to recognise.\nAdding to this confusion, some Spanish\nand French populations of this species\nactually lay eggs (but are nonetheless\nstill called viviparous).

She then began\nworking with the British coal utilization research association in World War II. Her main contribution to the\nmodern model of DNA was her development of X-ray\ncrystallography that took Photo 51, together with PhD\nstudent Raymond Gosling.\nMaurice Wilkins was already working at Kings\u2019 College at the time of Franklin\u2019s arrival.

Watson\nworked there due to his fascination with\nt h e crystallography work taking\nplace in the laboratory,\nwhile Crick was writing\nhis dissertation on the\nX-ray crystallography of\nhaemoglobin.\nT h e y\nworked alongside e a c h\nother, using DNA photography published by Franklin\nand Wilson, much without Franklin\u2019s knowledge. The\nimagery allowed them to understand the molecular\nstructure of DNA, as their main strength was theoretically interpreting the science behind the images. It\nshould be noted that their success was only possible\nwith the aid of William Astbury and Lawrence Bragg\nwho demonstrated that X-rays can be used to determine the positions of atoms within a crystal. Daniel\nrecognises these contributions, particularly of Rudolf\nSigner too, who produced extraordinarily pure DNA\nfrom the thymus of calves, of which he took 15 grams of\nextraordinarily pure DNA to London. While in England\nhe distributed his samples to notable scientists, among\nthem Maurice Wilkins, to promote further research in\nthe field.

Photo 51 was a major scientific milestone as it was able to provide Watson and Crick\nwith the evidence needed to create their 3D model of\nthe DNA, as Photo 51 demonstrated that DNA took the\nform of a double helix.\nPictured alongside the micro camera is a hydrogen\ncanister, which was crucial to improve the quality of\nthe image taken in the lab, by limiting air fogging up\nthe camera.\nThe inclusion of all five scientists that led to the DNA\nmodel we know today is crucial to the set\u2019s educational\nendeavours, as it shows the collaborative effort needed\nto make the scientific discovery. It also allows each scientist the validation they deserved and true acknowledgment of their efforts in discovering the \u2018secret of\nlife\u2019.

Current laws\npermit this on national security grounds.\nThe plans, which would cover international students and staff at British\nuniversities, follow reports of growing\nantisemitism linked to Hamas\u2019s 7th\nOctober terror attacks and Israel\u2019s response\nto them. In London, the Met Police have\nreported a 1350% increase in antisemitic\nincidents, including assault, damage to\nJewish property, and online abuse.

He hasn\u2019t made a physical model of\nLego DNA, though this is his dream; if his\nidea reaches 10,000 supporters on Lego\nIdeas his concept will be made into a\nphysical Lego set available in Lego stores\nacross the world. Amassing over 4,078\nsupporters having been on the site for\njust under 3 months, Daniel\u2019s design\u2019s is\non track to be reviewed by Lego and potentially be made into an official Lego set.\nLego DNA comes in two distinct parts.\nThe main build of the set is a model of\nDNA that is approximately half a metre\nin height, comprised of a scientifically accurate sugar-phosphate backbone\nwith hydrogen bonds in-between. Accompanying the main model is a mul-ti-functional science lab emulating\nthe experimental set-up of the DNA\ndiscovery triumph at King\u2019s College London and the University of Cambridge.\nDNA Model\nDeoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) is made\nfrom two polynucleotide chains twisted\nforming a double helix. The nucleotides\nmaking up each strand consist of deoxyribose (a pentose sugar), a phosphate\ngroup and a single base (adenine, gua-nine, cytosine, or thymine). The light\nblue blocks on Daniel\u2019s model are deoxyribose and the orange blocks are the\nphosphate groups. The nucleotides are\njoined by phosphodiester bonds between\nthe phosphate group of one nucleotide\nand the deoxyribose of another. This\nforms the phosphodiester backbone.\nEach DNA molecule consists of two\nstrands of complementary nucleotide sequences running in opposite directions;\nthey are anti-parallel. One of the DNA\nstrands is the sense strand which runs in\nthe 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction. Daniel has used arrows on the deoxyribose groups to show\nthis. The sense strand provides the codes\nfor the amino acids which make up the\nprimary structure of proteins. The direction of phosphate groups is also different between the strands, this leaves a\nfree phosphate group at the 5\u2019 end not in\na phosphodiester bond (only bonded to\none deoxyribose molecule). This can be\nseen as an orange circular piece of Lego\non the model.\nHis model shows precision down to\neach atom on the bases. Adenine pairs\nwith thymine with two hydrogen bonds\nand cytosine pairs with guanine with\nthree hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen\nbonds are shown with white cylindrical\npieces of Lego. For each base the first letter of the base name letter is written (A,\nT, C or G). Daniel also provides a genetic\ncode puzzle for the builder to solve, adding another dimension of interactivity!\nThe builder must work out which amino\nacids are being coded for by the sense\nstrand of DNA. The DNA model has 12\nbases, and three DNA bases make up a codon and each codon codes for an amino\nacid. Therefore, the builder must solve 4\ncodons to determine the sequence.\nDaniel\u2019s model provides further detail\non the structure of DNA by including its\ndistinctive major and minor grooves.\nThese are the result of the bond angle between the nucleotide base and the\ndeoxyri-bose, the gly-cosidic bond,\nvarying depending upon\nwhich base is bonded. Another cool feature he includes\nthat mirrors DNA is the model has\na rotation of 36 degrees per base\npair, for every 10 bases\nthere is a full\nrotation of\nt h e\nhelix.\nD a n i e l\nreflects on embedding his DNA knowledge into the Lego model as\n\u201cone of the\nmost fun\nparts\u201d\nof the\nproject. Conversely,\ngetting his DNA structure stable in Lego\nform was not as fun. Daniel explains his\nsolution for increasing the stability of\nthe model: \u201cIt was really tough. What\naugmented my solution for the stability\nwas the phosphates of the DNA. In each\nlevel, there are eight connections, and\nbecause they are really, well connected,\nit all sticks together.

I\u2019ll admit that my choice, \u2018The Decisive Moment\u2019, didn\u2019t require much effort, as it\u2019s probably the most famous mantra in modern photography.\nRegardless of originality, it is a simple idea to keep in\nmind when you are taking your pictures \u2013 both digital\nand film.\nHenri Cartier-Bresson\u2019s book of the same name is perhaps the most acclaimed photobook of all time. Marking a milestone in street photography, many still follow\nits axioms when embarking on journeys in photogra-phy. It appeals to our universal desire as photographers\nto capture a single moment in time that represents an\nexperience, a situation, a feeling. This is no better represented than in Cartier-Bression\u2019s own Behind the Gare\nSaint-Lazare (1932).\nIn his foreword, Cartier-Bresson writes \u2018To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction\nof a second, of the significance of an event as well as of\na precise organization of forms which give that event its\nproper expression\u2019. However, fixing that dynamic aspect\nof everyday life into a still photograph is no easy task.\nAnd what better aspect of everyday life than compe-tition? Where every moment counts in the fight to win.\nCharlotte captured a brief pause where only the immediate counts, as the choice of where to throw the ball has\nalready been made. And the inevitable fact that it will\nland.\nIt is this aspect of timelessness that makes a moment\ndecisive. The moment itself has already passed, and\nwhat stays behind is but an image to remember it by. An\nAthlete\u2019s Reaction is the making of an immortal memory,\nand for many of us, that\u2019s exactly what photography is\nfor. I\u2019m sure that Cartier-Bresson would have liked this\nphoto that encompasses his famed mantra.\nThe Decisive Moment\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHow street photography\ncame to be.\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nAn Athlete\u2019s Reaction.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n16 | ARTS 3 November 2023\nAs I travelled from London to Milton\nKeynes to see the exhibition \u2018Beyond\nthe Page: South Asian Miniatures and\nBritain, 1600 to Now\u2019, memories of my\nuniversity days in New Delhi came rushing in \u2013 these memories always come to\nmind in gilded frames embellished with\nflowers and birds, inspired in large part\nby my study of Mughal Arts and Architecture.\nThe strongest memory is of my beloved professor, the late Dr Kavita Singh. She\nwould zoom in deeply on digital copies\nof the Mughal miniatures to help us appreciate the tiniest of details such as the\nfinesse of the Naqqashi carving on a tiny\nwine cup. However, 200 years of colonial\nrule meant that I would have to come to\nBritain to lay my eyes on the originals.\nThe underlying motif of the exhibition\nwas the interweaving of the personal and\nthe historical. What made it all the more\npowerful was the thematic, rather than\nchronological, curation of its collection.\nThe artistic form of the South Asian miniature has never felt more animated and\ncontemporary.\nIn the same room as the 16th\ncentury\npainting of a bloody battle scene from\nthe Akbarnama (the official chronicle\nof Emperor Akbar), I also encountered\nthe artist Hamra Abbas\u2019 re-imagination\nof the same painting in a post 9/11 con-text. The digital animation, Battle Scenes\n(2006), featured random people from\nparks of London posing as warriors without armour and weapons, constructed in\na playful GIF-like format. Abbas deflates\nthe seriousness traditionally associated\nwith war, while also celebrating the cosmopolitan nature of the city.\nSimilarly, artist Imran Qureshi\u2019s The\nArtist\u2019s Younger Brother (1995) imbued the\ngrandiose format of the Mughal miniature with light-hearted informality. As\nQureshi recalls to The News magazine:\n\u201cWhile rehearsing a performance from\nthe 1970s, I saw my younger brother\nstanding at the back of the stage waiting\nfor his turn. He looked so cute in a 1970s\u2019\noutfit that I thought why not replace the\ntraditional kings and queens in miniature painting with common figures from\nour daily life.\u201d One such figure bore a\nresemblance to Amol Palekar, the post-er-boy of the \u2018middle-of-the-road\u2019 Bombay cinema of the 70s. This was a genre\nof films that engaged with the lives of\ncommon people living in urban cities in\na realistic manner, often laced with humour and satire, in direct contrast to the\nlarger-than-life, hyper-masculine mainstream Bollywood movies of the time.\nRealism of another kind characterised\nAli Kazim\u2019s Children of Faith series (2022).\nInspired by 18th\ncentury Indian portraits\npatronised by East India Company officials (placed adjacently), Kazim\u2019s work\noffered a scathing critique of the tragic\ncrimes against children being committed\nin the name of religion.\nA hall dedicated to love, loss, and longing led the viewer through painted erotic\nminiatures, exemplified by Madho\u2019s The\nprivate pleasure of Raja Bhagwant Singh (c.\n1678). One also saw the theme of pursuit\nof kama (loosely translated as pleasure)\ngo beyond sexual intercourse, touching\nupon themes like consumerism. Because\nYou\u2019re Worth It? II (2022), a post-modern\nartwork by The Singh Twins, employed\nthe grammar of the South Asian miniature to depict the violence embedded in\nour lust for more things. Borders overflowing with crumpled Kit-Kat wrappers,\nempty Coca Cola and beer bottles, and\nfish fighting for their lives, replace the\nflowered borders with exotic animal and\nbird species typical of Mughal art. Do we\nas a society deserve the pristine beauty\nembodied in the Mughal gilded borders?\nCan we reasonably use them as an escape\nthe harsh, blood-soaked, plastic-choked\nreality of the 21st\ncentury?\nARTS\nArtsWriter\nSHREYA SHARMA\nA review of a\nnew exhibit of\nSouth Asian art\nin Milton Keynes.\nBeyond the Page: South\nAsian Miniatures and\nBritain, 1600 to Now A music party scene by Abanindranath Tagore.

After spending\nfirst year in the College\u2019s student\nhalls, the London rental market proves far less glamorous than\nanticipated \u2013 a series of torments\nensue, which only end with the\nsigning of a two year long lease for a\nshoebox-sized apartment. The\nyears in this humble building pass\nslowly, and you vow to leave the\nmodest abode behind in the search for\nwhat will hopefully be a somewhat more\npresentable find. Cured for the rest of\nyour life from any of your leanings towards claustrophobia through exposure\ntherapy, your re-entry to the housing\nmarket is tackled with motivation and\nhope.\nThough you can hear the\nRightmove gods\u2019 evil laugh in the\nback of your mind every time you\ndare check new rentals, it does\nlittle to abate your tireless search.\nFinally, after a few ignored offers that\nhave brought you close to your breaking\npoint, it comes \u2014 the long-awaited \u201cThe\nlandlord accepted your offer!\u201d WhatsApp\nmessage. Blinded by the prospect of\nhaving a living room bigger than a car\ntrunk, you don\u2019t even question your\nagent\u2019s mysterious profile picture\n(maybe he\u2019s sponsored by Grey Goose?).\nNow, the real work begins. Friend\nor foe, everyone you\u2019ve ever spoken to\nreceives an invitation to the\nhouse-warming of an apartment you\u2019re\ndue to move into in two months. The\nnumber of guests grows by the day, but\nthe logistics of this party are a bridge that\nyou will cross when you get to it.\nSuddenly, it is Wednesday, and the\nparty is Friday, and you realise the event\nplanning has in fact not been ongoing\nand there are some potential issues that,\nthree months ago, you did not factor in.\nThe bridge you need to cross is seriously\nlacking structural integrity.\nWe\u2019ve all been there, right?\nDealing with the consequences of such\nambitious party announcements may\nseem an insurmountable quest - were it\nnot for the perfectly curated \u201cGuide to a\nperfect house-warming party\u201d below.\n1. Establish that your neighbours\nwill not pose an issue. A make-it or break-it element. This is best\ndone by testing the waters before\nyou start inviting everyone you\nknow and marketing the event as\n\u201cthe party of the decade\u201d. However, if, with the invitations already\nunderway, the neighbours reveal\nthemselves to be the type to knock\nat your door when the washing machine is running past 9PM, fear not.\nCrossing fingers has been known to\nhelp.\n2. Make sure not to invite more\npeople than your apartment\nfits. This is a tricky one. One can\neasily get carried away in the planning process and suddenly discover the guestlist triple-exceeds\nthe square meterage of the living\nroom. My best advice here: hope for\ncancellations.\n3. Set up ground rules with your\ninvitees. Of course, it would have\nbeen too much to ask to consider\nyour flat has carpet floors before\nplotting this party. Easy fix: it\u2019s a\nshoes-off event and red wine is not\ndesired. This should also aid with\nadhering to point 2. Two birds, one\nstone.\n4. Clean your apartment on the day\nof the party. Note: it is best to have\nacquired a vacuum cleaner before\nthis endeavour.\n5. Shop \u2018til you drop! Although\nBYOB is the accepted norm amongst\nself-respecting hosts, it has yet to\nreach some invitees, usually the\nmore prudent kind. In order to prevent death by awkwardness and/\nor panicked late-night runs to the\ndodgy corner shop seven minutes\naway, I would advise for preventative purchases. Chained to transparent liquids for carpeting reasons,\none escapes the enormous burden\nof infinite choice and may select one\nor two appropriate beverage types.\nFurther, snacks are a non-negligible\nelement of any good party. Consider\nguests will get hungry and they may\nraid your fridge for lack of alterna-tives. You do not want to find what\u2019s\nleft of your 24-month Grana Padano\nlaying next to the shoe rack in the\ndusk of Saturday morning. Stick to\neasily-digestible finger food, keeping in mind minimal effort, cost,\nand aftermath cleanup. Bread and\nhummus perhaps.\n6. Carefully curate your party play-list. Unfortunately, good taste in\nmusic is something only few of\nus were endowed with at birth. To\navoidtorturingunsuspectingguests\nwith \u201cAnother Love (HYPERTECH-NO EDIT)\u201d after naively handing the\nphone to your (then-)trusted friend\nto choose the next song, I advise the\nfollowing: create an 8-hour long\nplaylist with self-validated songs,\nconnect to your speaker, hit play 10\nminutes before event start, place\nphone in airtight container, secure\nsaid container with a key lock, hide\ncontainer, hide key, and deal with\npotential consequences later.\n7. Enjoy!\nGuide to the perfect\nhouseparty\nCOMMENT\nCommentWriter\nDELIA GINCU\nBecause, let\u2019s be honest, everyone\nwho found a place to live in London\ndeserves to celebrate.\nMaking a house a home is perhaps the most important thing after finding a place. Delia Gincu\n\n"

When\nyou hear \u2018beaver\u2019, you probably think of the buck-toothed\ndam-building rodents (Castor\ncanadensis) that populate North\nAmerica\u2019s national parks, but\nyou might be surprised to learn\nthat the Eurasian beaver (Castor\nfiber) can be found in much of\nnortheastern Europe (particu-larly Siberia) and select areas in\nwestern Europe. This included\nEngland up until 400 years ago,\nwhen excessive hunting caused\nt h e m\nto go ex-tinct. The\nLondon reintroduction follows\na string of successful\nbeaver colony establishments into various southern\nEngland counties.\nOther current wildlife restoration projects in the UK include European bison (Bison\nbonasus) in the woods of Kent,\nas well as protection of Scottish\nwildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris,\n\u2018Highland tigers\u2019) and Eurasian\nred squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris).\nDue to their ability to alter landscapes and support the survival\nof other wildlife, European bison are considered \u2018ecosystem\nengineers\u2019. One of the three bison females has already successfully birthed a calf in the wild \u2013 a\npositive sign for the future of\nthe herd. Protection schemes\nfor the wildcats and\nred squirrels involve\nmonitoring programmes,\npublic awareness campaigns,\nhabitat management, and rehabilitation of the animals.\nThese rewilding projects,\nand the beaver reintroduction\nscheme, were made possible\nby conservation financing like\nthe Rewild London Fund. With\nenough of this funding going to\nthe right organisations \u2013 wildlife trusts and conservancies \u2013\nthese projects generally prove\nsuccessful at improving ecosystems biodiversity and restoring\nkey species, and in the long run\ncan contribute to nature-based\nsolutions for broader environmental challenges like climate\nchange.\n\u001e\nstudy recently\npublished in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics\nhas shown an\nincrease in\nhyd ro -fluorocarbon (HFC) emissions\nfrom factories in eastern China between 2015 and 2019.\nHFCs are potentially\nozone-depleting\ncoolants, used\nas a greener\nalternative to\nCFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) and\nHCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocar-bons) in refrigerator units and\nair conditioners. Reported levels of HFC-23 from China are\nsaid to be inconsistent with expected reductions following the\ncountry\u2019s commitment to the\nKigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol in 2015. These\nfindings were corroborated in\na 2020 publication in Nature,\nwhich found global HFC emissions had increased, contrary to\ntheir estimate that they should\nhave decreased by 87% following the protocol amendment.\nDespite their reports of a 99%\ndecrease in HFC emissions, the\nnew study has found China to\nbe responsible for nearly half\nthe HFC-23 contributing to the\nincrease.\nThis is disheartening to say\nthe least, and the worry here is\nnot just in the potential harm\ncaused by these chemicals,\nbut in the way other nations interpret this\nnews. There is a\ncertain sensationalism\na n d\nscepticism in how China\u2019s environmental commitments are\nreported on, likely fuelled by\ncontinuing distrust in its research methods and policies.\nHowever, following a paper\nthat found high levels of CFC-11\nin the same region, the nation\nresponded swiftly and cooperatively to realign with its original\ncommitments. Steve Montzka,\none of the lead researchers on\nthe HFC paper, seems confident\nthat China will demonstrate a\nsimilar reaction following his\nrevelation. It has actually been\na crucial player in developing many of the world\u2019s major\nclimate agreements, such as\npushing through the \u201830 by 30\u2019\ntarget at last year\u2019s COP15 for\nbiodiversity, which was run by\nChina\u2019s environment minister,\nHuang Runqiu. The 30 by 30\ntarget aims to assign 30% of the\nworld\u2019s land and oceans protected status by 2030.\nDespite consistent engagement in environment conferences like COP15, China remains\nunder the scrutiny of other nations who have made the same\ncommitments, and a rapid response will be required on its\npart to maintain intergovernmental trust and encourage others to continue\nto do their own due\ndiligence.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0019\u0018\u0012\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0019\u0018\u0012\nBeavers\nback in\nBritain\nChina exposed\nfor high levels of\nunreported HFCs\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0018\u0015\u001c\u0014\u001d\u0018\u0013\u001d\u0019\u0012\u001c\u0011\u0010\u000f\u000e\n\u001a\u0017 \u001c \u001d\u001d \u001c\u0017 \u0016\b\b\u0016\u0015\u0007\n\u0012\u001c\u0006\u0005\u0004\u001e \u0003\u0013\u001c\u0002\u001d\u0019\u0001\u001d\u0005\n\u000e\u0016\u0019\u001c\u007f\u0003\u0015\u0081\u0016 \u0016\u0003\u0015\u001d\u0019\u001c\u001a\u0015\u0016 \u0017\u008d\u001c \u001e\u0016\u007f\u001e\u001c\u0018\u0019\u001d\u001c\u0003\u0015\u001d\u001c\u0017\u0003\u001a\u0019\u007f\u001d\u001c\u0003\u008f\u001c\u0090\u009d \u0017\u0012\u001c\u0011\u0016\u0015 \u001a\u0015\u001c \u001e\u001d\u0015\n\n"
