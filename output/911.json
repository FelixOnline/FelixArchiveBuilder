    "content": "4 October 1\n9\n9\n1 Felix 9\n1\n1 Editorial\nedit on a It has been a manic week. I have\nhad so much caffeine pumped into\nmy system that I have been buzzing\nnear the ceiling most of the time.\nAll these fresh faced and\nenthusiastic first years have given\nme intimations of mortality and\nmade me feel very old. All in all it\nhas been an emotionally as well as\nphysically and mentally draining\nweek.\nThe Sports Centre This looks like it is going to become\nthe first cause celebr e of the\nacademic year. This issue contains\na news story on the subject, and I have already received two letters\nagainst the proposed changes and a promise of one from Val Straw, of\nCollege Estates, saying what a good\nidea they are. None of these reached\nFelix in time for inclusion (deadline\n- Monday lunchtime), but they will\ngo in next week's. It is true that the\nSports Centre is, at best, rather\nspartan. Unfortunately a vast\ninvestment such as the one proposed\ninevitably means that prices for\nstudents will go up. I believe that\nmost students would prefer a basic\nsports centre they could afford\nrather than a plush one that they\ncould not. If student prices do not\ngo up then their access will be\nincreasingly limited allowing outside people to use the facility\noriginally intended for the students\nand staff of Imperial.\nHaving attended an Athletic\nClubs Committee meeting in which\nthe subject was raised, it has\nbecome clear that students simply\ndo not trust that the progenitors of\nthis scheme have students' interests\nat heart. I do not think this is unduly\ncynical - very few of college's money spinning ideas ever do. In\nfact it was unanimously agreed that\nthe proposed changes were bad, and\na number of individuals commented\nthat the College was less than\nwholly frank and open on the entire\nsubject. The concensus was that all\nthe clubs that use the facilities are\nseriously pissed off about the\nchange in prices, arrangements and\ntimes of access, so annoyed in fact\nthat they are going to do something\nabout it. This is a rare occurrence\nat Imperial - things have to be\nseriously bad for students to start\ndoing something to rectify the\nsituation\nThere is a rather strange circular\nargument being propounded concerning the reason for the face\nlift. To wit, better facilities are\nnecessary to attract external sporty\ntypes, which presumably are\nneeded to finance the building of the\nbetter facilities. Zoe Hellinger has\nsaid that if the Sports Centre intends\nto try to dig into Harlington Trust\nfunds, the Union will strongly\ncontest it. Students will have to pay\nfor these facilities through increased\nprices and restricted access. I fail\nto see the benefit for students since\nthey do not require Jacuzzis, saunas,\nsun beds and extra cafes. That part\nof the college is very well endowed\nwith place to buy food and drink,\nand most of the luxury 'health spa'\nbits can be found at the University\nof London Union. In any case very\nfew students are going to have the\ntime to lay for hours in a sun bed, and those who find a warm ish shower a luxury are unlikely to fork\nout for a Jacuzzi. A cleaner facility\nwould be nice, though.\nIn conclusion, short of more\nMend a Bike \u2022 BICYCLE REPAIRS \u2022 SALES AND HIRE \u2022 NEW AND USED BIKES \u2022 ACCESSORIES OPEN: 9.00am7.00 pm MONDAY TO SATURDAY46 Effie Road, Fulham Broadway,\nLondon SW6 ITD\n071-371 5867\nIC STUDENTS10% DISCOUNT ON ALL ACCESSORIES& SERVICES.

Many of\nyou will recall the questionnaire\nsent to all students earlier this year.\nThe working party set up to review\nthe policy were guided by the\nresponses to that questionnaire.\nIn determining the need for a smoking policy the college is\nacknowledging the increasing\nconcern about the risks to health\nincurred through smoking. A formal policy minimise s conflict\nand misunderstandings.\nThe policy outlines areas in\ncollege where smoking is banned.\nThese will be public circulation\nareas such as lifts, corridors, toilets\nand reception areas. Smoking will\nnot be permitted in official vehicles\nand enclosed sports areas. Smoking\nwill not be permitted in college\ncatering facilities unless they are big\nenough to accommodate a separate\nSelf-Defence Training Recently published crime figures\nshow an increase of over 10% in\nviolent crime, including rape and\narmed robbery. Indecent assaults\nrose by 2 6 % , which included a55% increase in offences among men.\nIncreasingly, an over stretched police force voices its frustration at\npeople's apparent unwillingness to\ntake steps to prevent crimes against\nthemselves and their possessions.\nAlthough South Kensington and\nthe surrounding boroughs are\nprobably the safest areas in London,\nattacks have been known to happen.\nFor those who are worried about\npossible attacks, a' Violence Awareness Course' for both men\nand women has been arranged by\nthe Union. Through simple but effective\ntechniques, you will learn how to\ndeal with situations, should they\narise. The physical and psychological self defence techniques taught to you will help\nyou to handle most situations that\nthreaten your personal safety. All this is explained in a concise and\nclear manner, showing how easy it\nis to be both aware and safe.\nThe course takes place over two\n2.5 hour sessions on Tuesday 8th area for smokers. Bars will not be\naffected by this policy.\nThe policy will be implemented\ndepartment ally rather than imposed\nacross the college as a whole. Each\ncollege workplace is different and\nvarious characteristics and methods\nof work will need to be considered.\nThere are some buildings and\ndepartments where restrictions on\nsmoking already operate eg. lecture\ntheatres, meeting rooms, libraries\nand laboratories. These arrangements will continue.\nThe policy will apply to all\nmembers of staff, visitors, contractors, conference delegates\nand students.\nWhere accommodation permits\nthere will be areas where people\nwill be allowed to smoke. These\nwill be identified within departments.\nand Thursday 10th October at\n6.00pm. The cost of the course will\nbe \u00a33.00 (sub sidi sed!!) and there\nare limited places (30). If you would like to attend then please\nregister in the Union office by\n5.30pm Monday 7th October.\nFirst Aid Course What would you do if your\nneighbour in a lecture theatre\ncouldn't breathe or fell\nunconscious? Would you want to\nhelp but not know how? If this is\nthe case then you should attend a first aid course which leads to a certificate of ability to practice first\naid.\nThere is an 11 week course\nleading to the Health and Safety at\nWork certificate taking place on the\ncollege site. It begins on Monday\n7th October at 6.00pm( finishes\n9.30pm) and will be held in the\nHolland Club (underneath the Great\nHall) every subsequent Monday.\nThe price of this course is \u00a315.00,\npossibly the cheapest first aid\ncourse you will get. If you would\nlike to attend then please contact\nRoger Serpell on Internal Extension\n4045. Places are limited to 24 and\nwill be allocated on a first come first\nserved basis.\nHelp for those who wish to give\nup smoking Everyone recognises that giving up\nsmoking is not easy. One third of\nsmokers who responded to the\nquestionnaire expressed a desire to\nstop smoking.\nThe Health Centre will again be\nrunning a programme to help\npeople to give up smoking. These\nwill commence on October 1 and\nj information can be obtained from\nthe Health Centre (ext. 3091).\nTo all clubs\nand societies:\nDeadline for all\nnews/results is\nMonday each\nweek!\nWomen Certain difficulties are always\nexperienced by minorities within\nany society, and women at IC, who\nmake up only23% of the\npopulation, are by no means\nimmune. The situation is certainly\nnot impossible to live with, women\nhave a good deal here considering\nthat the powers that be within\ncollege are desperately attempting\nto increase that percentage. However, it can be quite a strain\nwhen you are surrounded by men\nconstantly. Often a time to relax in\na safe space amongst sympathetic\nwomen is all you need to recover\na flagging spirit. If there are any\ngeneral problems encountered by\nwomen, then this is the best forum\nin which to discuss them.\nIn order to see whether there is\na need for this kind of a ground,\nthere will be an introductory\nmeeting on Tuesday 8th October at\nl pm( bring your lunch) in the Union\nSenior Common Room. Both\nwomen and men are invited in order\nto test the acceptability of this kind\nof group amongst the IC population.\nIf you have any constructive ideas\nfor this group then I hope to see you\nthere!\nStudents can also encourage their\nfellow students and offer support to\nthose who are going through a difficult time.\nThe policy is not intended to\ncreate a situation within which\nsmokers will feel alienated.\nHowever, non-smoking is to be the\nnorm at Imperial College and as\nwith any college rule, repeated\ndisregard could lead to disciplinary\naction.\nJN Payne, Employee Relations\nManager.\nCASH PRIZES\nFRESHERS'\nSNOOKER\nTOURNAMENT\nThis Sunday (6.10.91)\nl pm Top Floor Union\nBuilding\nSmoking Policy\n\n"

The entire building has\nbeen redecorated and large areas,\nincluding the toilets and Ents.\nLounge and Union Office, have\nbeen refitted. Mandy Hurford,\nUnion Manager, estimated the total\ncost at about \u00a360,000.\nThe money came mostly from the\nAbout fifty pounds in forged ten\npound notes have been passed to\nunion facilities in the last two\nweeks. According to Andy Flannagan; Union Bar manager,\nsuch notes are presently flooding\nNorth and West London.\nThe forgery was detected when\nthe Bar's takings were sent to the\nbank which informed the police and\nthe bar of the fake notes' existence.\nAlthough it is thought that there are\nsome people deliberately using the\nnotes, there have been cases of\nnaive students unwittingly passing\nover forgeries. On the Friday\nbefore term, 27 September, a student entered the Union Bar and\nhanded over a note which had\nneither a watermark nor a solid line\ndown the centre. It was immediately\nreturned to the disconcerted student\nwho claimed he had no knowledge\nthat the note was a forgery.\nAt the Royal College of Science\nUnion Carnival on Monday night,\ntwo notes with the word 'forgery'\nwritten on them were handed over\nto the attendant of the burger stall.\nThis was only noticed after the\nUnion's Bar and Catering Committee and House Committee\n(responsible for the upkeep of the\nbuilding) with only a \u00a37,500\ncontribution from the College\nauthorities.\nThe move followed a questionnaire circulated amongst\nstudents which revealed that many\nstudents avoided the union building\nbecause of the poor decor and\nstandard of cleanliness.\nevent since the people on the stall\ncould not see the writing due to the\ndifficult circumstances. Ramesh\nPatel, assistant bar manager, said\nthat in future a lamp will be\nprovided for the benefit of stall holders. Roger Pownall, Southside Bar\nmanager, said that he had not been\noffered any forgeries yet, but he had\nseen one and claimed that 'it looks\ngood but it feels awful' - a distinguishing feature of the\nforgeries since they are printed on\npaper which is thicker than the\ngenuine note. A member of New\nScotland Yard commented that a genuine note had four distinguishing\nfeatures; a water mark, a continuous metal strip, quality\npaper and quality print. He added\nthat no forgery had all four of these\nqualities. He said further that he did\nnot consider the forgeries taken by\nImperial College Union to be part\nof the \u00a35m haul of \u00a310 and \u00a350\nnotes made in Harlow, Essex, in the\nlast few days and that it was far too\nearly in the investigation to make\nany other statement.\nThieves\nTerry Briley, security officer, has\nexpressed exasperation that people\nhave still not learned that valuables\nleft unattended are easy pickings.\nHe said that the number of wallets\nstolen were about average for this\ntime of year when thieves can\nmasquerade as fresher s with little\ndifficulty.\nWallets have been stolen from the\nStudent Union, the Physics Department, the Maths Department\nand the Health Centre. In all cases\nthe thieves walked into an unlocked\noffice and simply took them from\nunattended jackets.\nDramatic\nThe Imperial College Dramatic\nSociety, DramSoc, had both a windfall and a loss over the\nSummer. While organising the\n' Theatre WestEnd'( T WE) contribution the the Edinburgh\nFringe festival, they entered a prize\ndraw for dramatic societies, and\nwon a lighting desk worth \u00a33000.\nOn return from Edinburgh, on the\n1st September, all the lighting and\nsound equipment was left in the\nconcert hall, behind a single locked\ndoor. The equipment was checked\nand all was found to be present on\nthe 3rd, but when setting up for\nfresher's week, much was found to\nbe missing.\nAn inventory was taken and over\n\u00a39,000 of equipment (replacement\ncost) was found to be missing. The\nlighting and audio gear was\ndescribed as being ideal for a band\nor small theatre,consisting of lights,\nand a complete 500 Watt pa system.\nPolice have been informed, but no\nprogress has yet been made.\nTonight sees the second\ncarnival of the year. All the\ntickets have been sold except\nthe hundred which will be sold\nat the entrance to Beit Quad at\nthe time.\nBecause fire regulations\nrestrict the number of people\na lowed in the Union Building\nat any one time, entrance to the\nUnion Building on all carnival\nnights is by ticket only along\nwith a student union card.\nJonathan Griffiths, ICU\nDeputy President\n1\n\u00ab\nM^ Lj %\n5 \\~\n*\n\\\nLack of licence\nloses lucrative\ngig\nThe band ' Lush', due to play a concert in the Union on the 9th October have pulled out. The\nPromoters, Metropolis Music, booked what they thought was an\nopen show with no restrictions on\nentry. Imperial College Union is not\npermitted to hold a public entertainments licence, needed for\nthis type of event, so only students\nof the college would be allowed to\nattend.\nBecause of this. Metropolis\nagreed to co-promote the show with\nImperial College Ents with tickets\nstating 'students and their guests\nonly'. Despite this, Metropolis\ncontinued to set up an open show,\nagainst the ICU byelaws.\nMuch advertising had already\nbeen circulated, but when the band\nheard of the restrictions, they pulled\nout of the show. Ents Chairman,\nGraham Lawton, who originally\nbooked the band, said 'We spent a lot of time trying to rescue it, but\nthere's nothing we could do'.\nRailcards\nBritish Rail are offering half price\nYoung Person's Railcards until 9\nNovember. They will cost \u00a38\ninstead of \u00a316. Forty pence of this\nwill go to the Friends of the Earth.\nEMERGENCY The Union Handbook is required urgently by large\nnumbers of students at Imperial College. Much has not yet been collated and it cannot be done by Union staff\nand sabbaticals alone.\nCould all those who wish to help please meet in the\nEnts Lounge in the Union Building on Monday 7\nOctober at 7pm. Contact Zoe on 3501\nor Adam on 3515\nif you require more information\nForging Ahead\n\u201412\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Letters Felix 9\n1\n1 4 October 1\n9\n9\n1\nSouthwell's Shame\nDear Felix,\nAs the committee of Southwell\nHall, we are writing to you in order\nto express our concern at the current\ncondition of this Hall. Last year our\nconcerns were countered by promises of swift action and\nmaintenance over the summer\nbreak. None of these promises were\nhonoured. This has resulted in a further decline in the state of the\nhall despite an increase in the rent\nfor a single room.\nWe arrived in hall a week early\nin order to prepare for the arrival\nof the new residents. Traditionally\nthis has involved moving and\nrearranging furniture, both in rooms and the communal areas.\nHowever, this year we have spent\napproximately 2 5 0 man hours\nengaged in these activities as well\nTrust\nHal Hartley with Trust has yet again\nproven, on a shoestring budget, his\nability to make us laugh at even the\ndarkest subjects. His second attempt\nproves that his first film, The\nUnbelievable Truth, was not just a one-time thing but an intimation of\nthings yet to come.\nTrust is about two people helping\neach other realise that the\nstereotypes imposed on them are\nnot necessarily who they are and the\ntransformation that takes place in\nthe process. The issues touched\nupon by Hartley such as child abuse\nand alcoholism never become\nover emphasised. He retains this\nlight-handed attitude with snappy\ndialogue and a bit of surrealism.\n(Now really, who would carry a live hand grenade just in case he\ndecided to commit suicide or blow\nup a building?) That's part of the\ncharm of this movie; slight quirks\nkeep the film just off-balance\nenough for us to laugh in the middle\nof an abortion scene and not feel\nguilty about it later.\nMatthew Slaughter, the lead\nplayed by Martin Donovan, is\ndesperately trying to retain his\nas reporting defects, cleaning out\nrubbish, mending locks, and repairing furniture. This figure does\nnot include work done by the\nwardens, sub wardens, and college\nmaintenance men and cleaners.\nDuring this time 118 minor defects\n(requiring less than 15 minutes to\nrepair) and 19 major defects\n(requiring hours to days to repair)\nof an essential nature were reported.\nThis excludes major faults such as\nwater hammer (?\u2014Rose), holes and\ncracks in walls, peeling paint, and\nshoddy furniture. The two maintenance men employed by\ncollege to look after all the 650 +\nrooms in Evelyn Gardens have been\nworking extremely hard. Unfortunately, there are simply not\nenough of them for the task in hand.\nThere are three particular points\nintegrity in a world of business that\ncares more about quotas than\nquality. Even here Hartley does not\nsermon is e on the cold cruelty of big\nbusiness. Rather, we laugh at\nMatthew's way of dealing with it -putting his supervisor's head in a vise, for example. By doing this we\ndon't feel like we've spent two\nhours in a cinema being imprinted\nwith 'messages' and have a good\ntime instead.\nAdrienne Shelley plays his young\nlover. Shelley lends just enough\nwide- eyed innocence to her part of\nMaria the 17-year old drop-out\npregnant slut - that we have little\ndifficulty believing in her transformation to a bookish pseudo-intellectual with the help of Matthew. Martin Donovan exudes\nsuch charm on-screen that for\nanyone not to fall in love with him\nwould be hard - let alone an\ninsecure girl like her. The island\nthese two characters create for\nthemselves in a world gone mad on\nreality gives us just enough hope for\nhumanity yet.\nIf you've ever wanted to laugh at\nAmerican suburbia and the\nridiculous stereotypes perpetuated\nby this subculture - go see this\nmovie. Hell - even if you haven't see Trust for the sincere\nenjoyment of the madness created\nin what we call the 'real world'.\nJennifer Arg a bright. which we would like to make.\nFirstly, Southwell is a self-catering\nhall. Currently there is: one\nmicrowave per 45 residents; one\noven for 28 residents; and one\nworking cooker element for five\nresidents. Secondly, the rain over\nthe last weekend resulted in three\nnew leaks. We expect one to three\nfurther leaks every time we\nexperience a major rainstorm.\nFinally, three years ago when\nSouthwell and Mining Houses were\namalgamated into Southwell Hall,\ncollege promised an upgrade for the\nentire hall. This has yet to\nmaterialise. We could continue, but\nwe believe that we have made our\npoint.\nWe were all extremely concerned\nabout the reactions of the new\nresidents and their parents. It was\nbeing shown at the ICA. Red &\nRosy is a comic documentary about\ndrag racer Richard ' Big Red' Friedman.

What will happen\nif carbon dioxide release into the\natmosphere is not curbed? What is\nthe cost of limiting emissions?\nQuestions like these will be tackled\nby Dr Jeremy Leggett, a research\ndirector for Greenpeace International and former earth\nsciences lecturer at Imperial\nCollege, next Wednesday. We preview some of the answers from\nhis book 'Global Warming - the\nGreenpeace Report'\nGlobal warming often appears to\nbe presented in two different ways.\nThe greens are viewed as\nharbingers of catastrophe and\nprescribe lifestyles unacceptable to\nmost people. The other view is that\nthe scientists are being alarmist, that\nit is pointless to spent huge\nquantities of money on a problem\nthat might not materialise.\n' Global warming the\nGreenpeace Report' presents, very\nclearly and a politically, the middle\nroad. The broad scientific basis to\nglobal warming is fairly well\nknown, but what most 'people on\nthe street' find hard to understand\nis the concept of scientific uncertainty, the uses of figures with\nerror limits. Given that even the\nsimplest measurement is subject to\nuncertainty, how much more so the\nproblem of climatic modelling.\n' . . . Many critiques somehow under stress the fact that the sword\nof uncertainty has two blades: that\nis, uncertainties in physical or\nbiological processes which make it\npossible for the present generation\nof models to have overestimated\nfuture warming effects, are just as\nlikely to have caused the models to\nhave underestimated change...' The\nproblem is compounded by the fact\nthat natural weather variations are\nlarge, so that it is difficult to pick\nup the initial stages of a trend to a warmer earth. What is certain,\nhowever, is that the atmospheric\nconcentration of carbon dioxide is\nvery high, and is increasing rapidly.\nAnalyses of cores taken from the ice\ncaps show that high carbon dioxide\nlevels are associated with higher\nearth temperatures.\nMany people argue that global\nwarming may be a good thing.\nAfter all, cold areas in the world\nwill surely become fertile, and the\nincreased carbon dioxide will\nstimulate plant growth, thus\nDr Jeremy Leggett is the first\nspeaker in this year's Physics\nDepartmental Colloquia series.\nEntitled 'Global Warming: A Climate of Change', the colloquia\nis on Wednesday (9 October) at\n1.15pm in Lecture Theatre 1,\nlevel 3, Physics Department.\ntrapping more carbon? The experts\nthink not. Plant growth depends on\nnutrient availability, which may not\nincrease. Respiration( which releases carbon dioxide) of plants\nand soil microbes is stimulated by\nwarming more than photosynthesis\n(which locks up carbon). To avoid\nmass extinction, plant species will\nhave to migrate many times faster\nthan is shown by the fossil record\nand modern experiments. main electricity consumers), than to\nbuild new power stations.\nInformation about efficient energy\nuse is needed to increase consumer\nawareness of the cost-effectiveness\nof insulation measures, and the use\nof renewable-energy sources, which\ncan completely replace fossil and\nnuclear fuels. '.. .Technology exists\nthat can produce electricity or any\ntemperature heat (up to 1,400\ndegrees C) directly from natural\nInsulate\nMoreover, increase in global\ntemperature will mean much greater\nvariability in weather patterns: we\ncan expect more storms, more\nflooding, more drought, more\nharvest failure and reduced lowland\nrainfall. In addition, pests that die\nin cold winters may survive, and\ndisease epidemics are likely to\nsweep across a world competing for\nclean water supplies. The outlook\nseems bleak.\nWhat can be done? Advocates of\nsackcloth and ashes rarely get a warm reception. It is obvious that\nthe output of carbon dioxide (and\nother pollutants) must be\ndramatically curtailed to prevent a rapid change in the earth's average\ntemperature. What is completely\nwrong is the conception that\nreduced output is going to cost a huge sum of money. The West must\nis increase efficiency of energy use,\na measure that in the long term\nactually saves money. '...It is\ngenerally cheaper today to save fuel\nthan to burn it. Avoiding pollution\nby not burning the fuel can\ntherefore be achieved, not at a cost,\nbut at a profit - so this result can and\nshould be widely implemented in\nthe market-place...' A chapter on\nenergy efficiency in ' Global Warming' demonstrates how US electricity-generating utilities find it\ncheaper to sub sid is e energy-efficient lighting and motors (the\nresources available at a remote\nlocation in nearly any country. The\ndemand can be satisfied without\ntransporting a continuous, long-distance stream of fuel or running\nlong distance electric power transmission lines - or emitting vast\nquantities of greenhouse gases...\nThere is no qualification needed for\nthese statements. Technically, it is\npossible. Economically, it is a more\nlimited situation, but not nearly as\nmost observers and analysts\nbelieve...' Indeed, if governments\nstopped sub sidi sing fossil fuel\nusage, but diverted some of that\nmoney towards energy-efficient\nusage of renewable energy, the\ngreenhouse effect could largely be\nmitigated.\nThe industrial revolutions of the\nfirst world involved relatively small\npopulations, hence relatively small\nrelease of carbon dioxide. Old and\ninefficient technology in a Chinese\nindustrial revolution would result in\nthe release of huge quantities of\ngreenhouse gases. Since lesser-developed countries ( LD Cs) want to\ngrow, the first world must supply\nthe appropriate technologies, and\nencourage them to use it. After all,\nwhy build power stations and a national grid, when, for a smaller\ncost (both economic and\nenvironmental) you can built micro-grids supplied from renewable\nresources?\nIf the world carries on with\n'business-as-usual', the effects of\nglobal warming will not be\npleasant. But the solution to the\nproblem is already available, and at\nless cost. People and governments\nmust turn their backs on expensive\nand finite fossil fuels, and think\nefficiency, think renewable, think\nlong-term.\n'Global Warming - the Greenpeace\nReport', edited by Jeremy Leggett,\nwas published in 1990 by the\nOxford University Press.\n'Avoiding\npollution by not\nburning the fuel\ncan therefore be\nachieved, not at\na cost, but at a profit...

The present\nHaldane Library is named after RB Haldane, politician, Renaissance\nman, and an instigator of the merger\nof IC's constituent colleges. The\nHaldane Library has the dual\nfunction of providing a wide range\nof general reading for all members\nof the College, and supporting the\nteaching and other activities of the\nHumanities programme.\nThe Haldane Library is situated\non Level 2 of the Central Libraries\nand is accessible from the entrance\nopposite the Queen's Tower from\n9.30am to 9.00pm on Mondays to\nFridays (9.30am to 5.30pm on\nSaturdays) and from the Level 2\nentrance between 11.00am and\n4.00pm on Mondays to Fridays\nduring term (vacation hours are\nshorter). The library card, obtainable from the registration\ndesk on Level 1 of the library,\npermits the borrowing of up to four\nbooks (including maps and music\nscores), two records or cassettes (or\none of each), and 2 compact discs.\nFor CDs a contribution of 50p per\nissues is requested; this is to provide\nfor further purchases and security\nin the collection, which was set up\nby means of grants and voluntary\ncontributions. Books may be\nborrowed for one term, and are\nissued from the main issue counter\non Level 1. Sound recordings are\nissued for three weeks from the\nsound recordings issue desk in the\nHaldane Library itself. The Music Library (books, periodicals, music\nscores and sound recordings) is\ncurrently open from 11,00am to\n4.00pm, Monday to Friday, but it\nis hoped that these hours will be\nextended during the course of\nsession 1991-92.\nThe Haldane Library aims to\ncater for all tastes and it would be\nimpossible to describe its contents\nexhaustively. Most conspicuous are\nsuch subjects as politics, history,\ntravel, biography, music, art\nhistory, philosophy, and literature,\nbut there is much more besides.\nThere are, for example, well-used\nsections on consumer matters,\nsport, gene ology, transport, feminism, religion and humour.\nBeyond this it is well worth a browse to discover some of the\ncurios it ites, which, quite apart from\nthe fringes of psychology, range\nfrom giants to Egyptian grammar.\nThe most requested authors this\nyear have included Nostradamus, as\nwell as, more predictably, Umberto\nEco and Tom Wolfe.

    "content": "Issue9114 October1991 Suffer for Sport?\nStudent facility or private health spa ?\nProposed changes to the college's sports centre by Prince's Gardens\nhave caused fury amongst the\nstudent body. These changes\ninclude a conversion of the present\nGym-cum-weights room into a cafe\nor lounge area, and inclusion of\nsaunas, sun-beds and Jacuzzis. In\naddition, prices for students are\ngoing to up and access times for\nsports clubs will be limited or\nmoved.\nThe price for a season ticket this\nyear is \u00a318 for nine months - as\nthree months will be used for\nrefurbishment - compared to \u00a312\nfor twelve months last year. It is\nprojected that next year the price\nwill be \u00a324 for students, which\ncompares to \u00a3100 for non-college\npeople.\nThis refurbishment is due to take\nplace in Spring 1992 for 12-16\nweeks at an estimated cost of\nbetween \u00a3300,000 and half a million pounds. In a written note\nGordon Marshall, Director of\nEstates, referred to the 'South\nKensington Sports Centre' and said\nthat it was intended 'to market\nimprovements to make the centre\nself financing and it possible profit\nmaking.' In addition, Southside\ngym would be divided in two, one\nhalf to replace the gym previously\nin the Sports Centre, the other for\nthe events that usually take place in\nit.\nRay Coleman, Manager of the\nSports Centre, told Felix that he\nbelieved the refurbishment was to\nbe financed by a loan from the\ncollege. He said that the new idea\n'appeals to students and staff we\ncan attract people from outside to\npay competitive rates to sub sid is e student and staff use of sports\nfacilities.' He added that 'at the\nmoment we can't justify external\nrates... I can't promise that there\nwon't be an increase (in student\nprices) but not a great increase'.\nZoe Hellinger, Union President,\nsaid that she had recieved a number\nof complaints from clubs using the\nswimming pool. The underwater\nclub will have its session moved so\nthat it will not finish until 10.30pm rather than 9.30pm as at present.\nOther clubs have said that the\nun social hours they have been\nallocated mean that they are less\nattractive to new members. They\nalso say that few students wish to\nexercise so late in the evening as\nthey are too tired.\nOther complaints from clubs of\nthe Athletic Clubs Committee\n( ACC) include the belief that there\nwould be too few cubicles for the\nswimming pool, the centre doesn't need another bar - which won't have any alcoholic drinks - and that\na sports centre ought to maximise\nits sports facilities rather than have\nsnack bars.\nCraig Robinson, Squash Club captain, told Felix that 'nobody has\nbeen told what Ray Coleman's brief\nis... it appears to be a self financing\nbrief\". The ACC said that it\nbelieved that Mr Coleman was not\nremotely interested in student\nfacilities and had said so on more\nthan one occasion.\nThis is not the first time the\nSports Centre has been in the lime-light. When it was built it cost just\nover a quarter of a million pounds\nand was beset by technical problems, postponing the opening\nand increasing the planned costs. It\nwas originally intended to be open\nto both students and staff of the\nCollege, as was reported in Felix,\n2nd October 1968. No mention was\nmade by Rex Low in, Union President of that year, of outside\nusage or profit. Finance for the\ncentre came almost equally from the\nCollege and outside grants. The entrance charge was a shilling (just\nfive pence) for entrance to the pool\nand squash courts. Today it will\ncost you eighty pence if you are an\nImperial student and \u00a31.75 if you are not.\nSee next week's letters for further\ncomment.\nNew\nSecurity\nImperial College will have a new\nsecurity system by January 1992 if\neverything goes as planned. The system will require each student to\ncarry an identification card to gain\naccess to campus buildings after\nnormal hours, although the campus\nwill be open as usual during the\nday.\nTerry Briley, College Security\nOfficer, told Felix that the cost was\nunder discussion. ' We are still\ndoing a lot of homework', he\nadded. The College will be paying\nfor the new system, and the\nidentification cards will be provided\nwith no cost to the students. T can't see how it can be detrimental to\nanybody,' said Jonathan Griffiths,\nUnion Deputy President.\nMr Griffiths said that he thought\nit would be a 'preventative measure\nrather than trying to cure\nsomething.' Each student will have\nan identification number which will\nautomatically enter the system when\nthe card is used. The system will\nrecord the movements of each\nindividual around campus. There is\nthe possibility that an unwelcome\nindividual's movements can be\nlimited by programming their\nnumber into the system to be\nrejected. Mr Briley said that the\nprecise details of the system\ndepended on which one college\nchose.\nBoth Messrs Briley and Griffiths\nsaid that in their opinion the\nadministration and the students feel\nthat the system is a good idea. ' We will all benefit from it,' said Mr. Griffiths, ' no one should be\nwandering around the quad for any\nreason.' The proposal is currently\nbeing reviewed by all of the\ndepartmental heads. If it is\napproved by everyone, then\ninstallation will begin ready for use\nearly next year. Mr Briley ended by\nsaying that 'it would be best to say\nthat college is looking into a college-wide security system.'\n\n"

In fact,\nChristianity does not claim to\nprovide the truth about man's existence. It's not quite as easy as\nsending in a self-addressed envelope\nand getting back simple answers to\nuniversal questions. Perplexities\nremain.

It's deep enough and\nbroad enough to have been the\nfoundation of Western civilisation\nfor most of the last two millennia.\nThe core of this truth is simple\nenough to be grasped by a child and\nprofound enough to feed poets and\nphilosophers through the ages; there\nis a person behind what we see and\nexperience and that person cares\nabout you. God loves you.\nIf that's true, it's worth knowing.\nIf He' s true, He' s worth knowing.\nA lot of people, many of them sane,\nreasonable and even intelligent\nbelieve they do know Him, and that\nknowing God is the sweetest thing\npossible.\nThe truth isn't easy, but\nprofoundly good.
