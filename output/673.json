    "content": "Anti-Apartheid: Right or Wrong?\nLast term a questionnaire was\ndistributed by the Anti-Apartheid\nSociety on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union in order to gauge\nstudent awareness of the effects of\napartheid.\nCriticisms were made of the\nquestionnaire as being biased\ntowards specific standpoints. In\nsetting out the questionnaire in\nthis way\u2014a statement, followed\nby a question or questions\nrequiring a yes or no answer\u2014we\nwere trying to be as informative\nabout the situation as we understand it to be, and to provide\n'food for thought'. Obviously,\nthe condensation to a sentence of\nsuch wide issues gave a stark and\nchallenging aspect to the sen-ten ce. The yes/no format of the\nanswer also left no room for 'ifs'\nand 'buts' or the statement of any\nreservations one might have in\nhaving to give 'black' or 'white'\n(!) answers. This was seen however as a means of making the\nquestionnaire acceptable to those\nwho had little time or energy to\nproduce longer answers. A 'comment' space was left at the\nend so that anyone who felt they\nwould like to qualify an answer,\nmake a point or give a point of\nview could do so. In this way we\ncould gauge the depth of interest\nor involvement felt by those\ncompleting the questionnaire.\nWe distributed about 500\nquestionnaires. Of these, 112\nwere answered, of this number,\n60 people made some interesting,\nthoughtful and relevant points\u2014not all in total support of\nour case, but many showed an\nunderstanding of the issues\ninvolved and were helpful and\nconstructive in their comments.\nOnly two were abusive.\nWe feel that, if by means of this\nquestionnaire, we have e fig aged the attention of a reasonable\nnumber of students, provoked\nsome into deeper thought about\nthe situation and informed a few\nof some facts hitherto unknown\nto them, the questionnaire will\nhave done its job.\nA record has been kept of the\nanswers and the comments\nretained as a basis for further\ndiscussion at subsequent\nmeetings of the Anti-Apartheid\nSociety. We would welcome to\nour meetings anyone who would\nlike to put their point of view on\nthe situation in South Africa, its\nrecord on human rights, and the\nfact that apartheid, unlike the\nrepressive practices which occur\nin other countries, is actually\nwritten into the Constitution of\nSouth Africa. There these issues\ncan be discussed in a reasoned\nand thoughtful manner, from\nwhatever standpoint you choose.\nWe cannot, as some of the\ncomments pointed out, change\nanything at these meetings but we\ncan listen to many points of view,\nlearn from speakers with firsthand knowledge of the situation,\nand being better informed, some\nof us may one day be in the\nposition to make changes for the\nbetter by exerting moral and\npolitical pressure, to prevent the\nviolation of human rights.\nWe realise that there are many\ncountries in the world where\nthere is repression and torture\nand human rights are abused, but\nwe, in this society are concerned\nwith what we perceive as the\nspecific evil of a particular abuse\nof human rights embodied in the\nConstitution of a country\u2014\napartheid as practiced in South\nAfrica and Namibia.\nErica Fuller\nChairperson, Anti-Apartheid\nSociety\nyes no don't refuted\nknow\n6 7 \u2014\n67 \u2014 \u2014\n67 6 \u2014\n38 1 \u2014\n22 \u2014 \u2014\n40 2 \u2014\n60 5\n80 5\n42 10 \u2014\n55 6 \u2014\n40 2 \u2014\n31 6 \u2014\n37 3 \u2014\n46 8 2\n62 31 \u2014\n19 10 5\n48 4 \u2014\n63 7 2\n17 13\n1984\nISupport\nYour\nGrant\nParliamentary\nLobby\nImperial College students will be\nparticipating in a mass lobby of\nParliament next Wednesday to\nprotest about Government plans\nto introduce a new system of\nmeeting student travel costs.\nAbout 125,000 students will face\na loss of income as a result of\nreplacement of the current\nmethod of repaying the full costs\nby a new flat rate system,\nalthough others will receive an\nunexpected windfall.\nThe new arrangements arc\nsomewhat complex. In future\nstudents who live away from\nhome will be paid an element of\n\u00a3 100 in their grant to cover travel\nStudents who stay with f heir parents will be paid \u00a3160. Thos,:\ncurrently studying on courses will\nalso be able to claim any travel\nexpenses in excess of \u00a3250.\nHowever, those who live\nScotland will be entitled to full\nreimbursement of their travel\ncosts as previously.\nIronically, the review of the\nstudent travel awards system was\noriginally intended to simplify\nadministration.\nImperial College students arc\nstrongly urged to attend the\nParliamentary Lobby. The\nUnion's delegation will be\nmeeting in the Union Office at\n2:15pm, and those wishing to\nparticipate should contact the\nUnion Office for more details.\nRemember\u2014it's your grant!\nStudents may stand to suffer\nfurther hardship as a result of\nDHS S plans to review the\npayment of Supplementary\nBenefit to young people, and the\nGovernment has also launched\nan attack on the Further\nEducation sector in its 'Training\nfor Jobs' White Paper.

    "content": "AP\nOutrage\nDear Editor\nAs current Alternative Prospectus Editor, I must voice\nmy feelings of anger and disgust\ntowards IC Exec for overruling\nCouncil's decision to provide a pewter tankard for the post of\nAP Editor.\nApparently the Exec consider\nsuch a provision 'unimportant'.\nAdding insult to injury,\nChristine Teller has gone on to\nsay that there is no reason why\nPublications Board cannot\npurchase their own tankard\noutside. (This would cost \u00a325\nmore than one from the Union.)\nApparently, the Exec are more\ninterested in conserving their\nslowly dwindling stock of\nblank tankards than seeing any\nof them put to good use.\nLet us remember what the AP is for: it is a publication which\nattempts to show students'\nfeelings about their courses and\nIC itself to prospective\nstudents. If the AP was 100%\nsuccessful, no one would come\nhere without knowing what\nthey were letting themselves in\nfor.\nIn the past, the AP was\nproduced by the Academic\nAffairs Officer. The Editor's post was created to put\nproduction and presentation\ninto the hands of a publications\nspecialist (and to take a large\nburden from the shoulders of\nthe A AO). Now let us consider tankards:\nfrivolous and unnecessary they\ncertainly are, but they remain a vital part of IC tradition. In\ntheir refusal to grant one to AP Editors past, present and\nfuture, Exec have insulted and\nbelittled David Rowe and Hugh\nSouthey and the hard work they\nhave put into the AP. They have\nalso forced the resignation of\nDavid Rowe, a most able Pub\nBoard Chairman who has\nalways been ready to help with\nadvice about printing, publishing and advertising for\npublications editors.\nAs to my own course of\naction, my resignation from the\npost of AP Editor would be\nentirely justified: I do not do so\nonly because this would be\ndetrimental to next year'sAP. Yours\nDiane Love\nPhysics PG\nAP Editor 1983/4\nPage 2 \u2022 HM H HI \u2022Letters-fo-the-BWor.^\nDear Pallab\nTo many the decision of\nDave Rowe to resign over a matter as apparently trivial as a pot io rAP must have seemed\npetty. After all pots, like many\nof IC's traditions, are merely\nanachronisms. Reminders of\nthe days when women weren't allowed in the Union Bar and\nthe Union Building was only on\ntwo levels. However to take this\nview ignores the significance of\nthese pots.\nPots are traditionally purchased by the Union for\ncertain Union posts. These\nposts have to be well\nestablished. Other than this\nthere appear to be few criteria\nfor the decision. There have\nnow been three AP Editors, all\nof whom have done the job to\nthe best of their ability. They\nhave each produced eighty page\nbooklets that have been among\nthe best of their kind in the\ncountry. All three have had to\nwork extremely hard (often into\nthe early hours of the morning)\nand have needed a high level of\ncommitment. When one\ncompares the performance of\nthe AP Editors with that of\nsome of the more anonymous\nUnion officers, who seem to\nhave been awarded pots\nbecause of their capacity for\nsherry, the only possible\nconclusion is that the Exec's decision was wrong, and a calculated insult to the A PJ Editors. Possibly the real'\nreason was the unpopularity of!\nFELIX with the Union Office.\nTo the majority of Union I members, the fact that the Exec |\noverturned a Council decision |\nshould be more worrying. The :\npot was approved unanimously\nby Council, a committee that is\nmade up of over forty people\nrepresenting all the Union's activities* It is a far more\nrepresentative committee than,\nthe Executive. The Executive I should only make decisions\nconcerning day to day decisions\nas it is made up of only six\npeople. Six people who can:\nhardly be said to bei\nrepresentative. Hopefully next\nMonday Council will overturn IH HB Hi Friday. May\nthe Executive's decision and\nshow that its decisions should\nonly be reversed by UG Ms( the\nmost democratic forum of all).\nIf you still think the AP Editor's pot is a storm in a teacup, then I apologise for\nwasting your time. However,\nhopefully this letter will have\nexplained the amazement of\nDave Rowe, Diane Love and\nmyself about the decision.\nYours\nHugh Southey\nAP Editor 1982/3\nDear Pallab\nI am shocked that the Exec\nshould refuse Pub Board a pot\nfrom the Union stock for use by\nthe AP Editor. They have interfered beyond the remit given to\nthem by the Constitution and\nhave no right to overturn\ndecisions by Pub Board and\nCouncil. I would hope the latter,\nbody would express their dissatisfaction at their action in the\nstrongest possible way.\nI hope that the Exec have\ngood reason to take the action\nthey did. It would be sad if such\na fine Exec has descended so far\nas to act out of petty\nvindictiveness. Such mean ess of\nspirit is very sad indeed.\nI remain\nYours sincerely\nStephen Goulder\nRG M Riot\nDear Sir\nLast Wednesday (21 March)\nwe held a party at RCM at\nwhich several IC students were\npresent\u2014and to which they are\nnormally welcome\u2014however,\namongst those IC students\npresent, 3 males have caused us\nmuch concern.\nThey did not wish to pay the\nmodest entrance charge of \u00a31,\nbut were persuaded to do so.\nBefore they left, they blocked\nthe sinks in the 3rd floor\nlavatories and left the taps\nrunning. This caused extensive\nflooding and put one of our lifts\nout of action. They also pulled I towel holders and tiles off the\nwall, pulled half a dozen lockers\noff the wall, molested a female\nstudent and departed with afire\nextinguisher.\nAt the time of this party, our\nBursar was celebrating his'\nretirement with colleagues and j the Council. The ensue ing mopping-up operation almost\nruined his party and left me\nconsiderably embarrassed.\nIn future, all non RCM students will be required to\nproduce identification and sign\nin at our parties which I think is\nunfriendly and tedious, but in\nthe light of what went on at our\nlast party, I think such\nmeasures are perfectly reasonable.\nYours faithfully\nDaniel Meye\nPresident\nNUS\nNasties\nSir\nOnce again the NUS debate is\nre-hashed in FELIX. The\nreport of Imperial's two\nobservers to the NUS Easter\nConference is factually inaccurate and glossed over the\nundemocratic and unrepresentative nature of NUS. Free\nspeech, for example, was not\npossible if you were a member\nof the Federation of Conservative Students (FCS)\nwhile the hard left of the\nLabour Students had ample\nfreedom to promote their\nrevolutionary activities. Physical assault and verbal\nab sue was rampant and the\npresent Vice Chairman of FCS was kicked in the head after a speech. Where delegates were\nthe only Tory from their\nuniversity there were many\ncases of intimidation by the\nother (left-wing) members of\ntheir delegation, and one who\nrefused to vote for a Labour\ncandidate had her voting card\nripped from her hand when she\ntried to vote. Many Conservatives were labelled as racist and\nfascist and the police had to be\ncalled several times to restore\norder.\nRather than promoting such\na reprehensible organisation as\nNUS should not Imperial be\nhelping other colleges in\nLondon to d is safi li ate as we\nhave?\nYours Graham Brown\nConSoc Chairman-elect\n11, 19841 I FELIX\n\n"

On the first day Jon Lea showed\nhis obvious longer distance ability placing\nthird in the 3000m(9m06 s) whilst Ming Tan\nand Graham Harker did battle in 800m, Ming\ngetting the better in fourth position with\nGraham in fifth, both clocked at 2m04s. The second day provided Imperial with\ntwo winners, both field events athletes.\nThales Kasagounis pole vaulted 3.00m to\nvictory whilst Richard Johnson triple jumped\n12.92m for gold. Mike Jones, last year's long\njump champion, a quitted himself well leaping\n6.35m for the silver medal as did Mark\nLuscombe who high jumped 1.95m for\nsecond.

Andy Creth finished strongly, clocking\n4m43.0s. Andy Belk showed all round ability\nwith his fifth in the javelin (41.36m) and fifth\nin the 2000m steeplechase (6m52.8s). Julie\nFortescue, also fifth, in the ladies 1500m ran\nstrongly against fierce opposition to be\ncredited with 5m58.0s \u2014a useful time if you\nconsider that Julie is training to run her first\nmarathon. Peter Sedders, whose best throw\nof 59.00m, would have easily won the\nChampionships, suffered run up problems\nand finished without a legal throw.

The sport was invented\naround 1910, and reached IC at\nthe start of this year, when IC\nWaterski Club was added to the\n200 or so water skiing clubs in\nBritain. It is one of the fastest\ngrowing sports in the country.\nCompetitive skiing is in 3 types:\nslalom, jumps and tricks.\nIC WSC is pitched, so far, at a more modest level.\nThe Club ski at the West\nIndia Docks on the Isle of Dogs\nevery Wednesday afternoon.

With sound\ninstruction on hand most people\nare quite proficient after the first\nfew tours.\nWhen I went to ski for the first\ntime, the first thing I was shown\nwas how to get up from the water\nto a standing position as the boat\npulls away. I was then taught how\nto do this while moving on the\nwater on the 'edge-bar', a simple\nbut very effective training device.\nA bar sticks out from the side of\nInvariably the\nskis came off\nthe boat to which the beginner\nholds on to for dear life. This\nallows instructions to be given\nfrom the boat until the all\nimportant techniques of getting\nup on the water has been\nmastered. This can be done in\none afternoon. I found I fell over a lot, and invariably the skis came\noff. This wastes some time while\nyou get in the boat to put them\non.

However,\nhot drinks are available after\nskiing, and there are hot showers\nin the changing rooms. In any\nYou don't need a wet\nsuit\ncase, the worst weather is now\npast.

All of the\nexperienced skiers I 've spoken\nto have skied in various exotic\nmiddle-eastern countries, and\nmuch swapping of stories goes\non between them.\nSo what do you need to join?\nWell, you don't need a wet suit or\nskis, which can be hired.

    "content": "Reviews\nrm= AMi=RS A scene from the Silwood Ball\nRobert Altman's Streamers (18, Gate\nBloomsbury) begins and ends with powerful\nsequences depicting the US army in\nmachine-like precision\u2014a company of soldiers drill immaculately in a strongly back-lit\nhaze accompanied by the sharp reports of\ntheir rifle actions and the smack of their\nboots on the parade ground. In between\npersonnel machinations are put under a powerful searchlight to reveal multiple flaws\nin an equally powerful if less entertaining\nfashion. The trouble with Streamers is that it .\nbetrays its origins as a stage play all too\nquickly; by confining the action to one\nbarrack room\u2014in here the squad dies live\nbefore being shipped to Vietnam\u2014Altman\nexcludes the possibilities so effectively\nutilised by Coppola in Apocalypse Now\nwhere the vast pa norma of Vietnam acted as\na stage for the characters. Nevertheless\nStreamers' budget was probably less than\nthat for helicopter fuel in Apocalypse and\nthere are stunning performances all round,\nnotably Mitchell Lichtenstein's Richie and\nMichael Wright as Carlyle the quick-talking\nsmart assed( clich ed) black whose abrasive\npersonality accentuates the strong racial and\nsexual tensions in the barrack room causing\nfurther deterioration of the already fragile\nfriendships.\nSimilarly evocative is Pal Sander's Daniel\nTakes a Train (15 Gate Notting\nHill\u2014Hungarian with sub-titles) the tale of\ntwo young men in the wake of the Hungarian\nuprising of 1956 and the subsequent Russian\nintervention. In an interview with the director\nprinted in the press handout Sandor states\nthat he didn't intend the film to clarify the\nevents of 1956, rather give an 'honest and\nauthentic presentation of a theme'. This he\ncertainly does in a taut film which is\nexcellently photographed from the\nsurprisingly original opening sequence to the\ncryptic conclusion which evokes chaos,\nconfusion and fear in equal proportions. The\nDaniel of the title is a vaguely incompetent\nyouth who boards the train to follow his\ngirlfriend who has left for Austria with her\nrich shop keeping parents. Also on the train is\nhis friend Gyari who as an insurgent is fair-game for the secret police patrolling the train.\nMuch of the train sequence which is central\nto the film is involved in brief snatches of\nconversation between other passengers who\nare all scared and seem to have secret\n(police) histories. Some of these are resolved\n(like Kapos, the acid-scarred ex-policeman\nwho once incriminated Gyari's father and\nwith whom Gyari briefly reconciles whilst\nwaiting for the trucks to shepherd them out\nof Hungary) but even more are never\nexplained\u2014two dandies, a hooker and one\nyoung couple. Daniel Takes A Train is\nessentially a film about loyalties\u2014\nideological, national and personal.\nAll the reviews are by Peter Rodgers. |\nPage 4\nSecret Places starring Jenny Agutter.\nWMWM Friday, May 11, 1984 WBM\nSet in the Germany of 1966 during the\nBritish beat invasion led by the Stones,\nBeatles, Kinks et al The Heartbreakers\n(15, ICA and Classic Oxford St\u2014subtitles)\nrecords the rise to near cult status of a band\nof that name. The central character is Bowie\nclone Freytay, much prone to in coherency, tantrums and crude sexism until he\nsuccumbs to the charms of nymph et te song stress Lisa. Many of Freytog's problems\narise from his total lack of home or family life\n(bar the odd goldfish) whilst Lisa's problems\nare exactly the opposite\u2014her drunken\ndegenerate father and motorcycle thug\nbrother.\nAdd to this randy drummer Schmittchen,\npill-popping fat so Uwe on guitar, harmonica\nand occasional church organ, bespectacled\nbassist Guido and chain-smoking 14 year old\nmanager Pico and you have the basis for a good comedy. Unfortunately superfluous\nincidentals in the plot and the sheer age of the\nmusic (and not even the originals at that) lead,\nto the film (at just two hours) being 30\nminutes too long and much too dated. The\ncharacters are also too young to be\nbelievable\u2014unlike the excellent Breaking\nGlass and more like Times Square (the worst\nteen music film this writer has seen).\nNevertheless its essentially circular\nnature\u2014it begins with Pico disappointed\noutside a Stones gig (bullshit was his verdict)\nand ends outside a similar hall with Pico\nequally downhearted due to The Heartbreakers' failure to win a Battle of the\nBands competition\u2014reflects the relentless\nand repetitive nature of the music industry. At\nthe end Pico still hasn'ta light for his cigarette\nand by unwittingly asking a mounted\npoliceman for one he provides a suitably\nthrowaway line to end a throwaway film.\nThe arrival of ice-cool German beauty\nLaura Meister into a class of pubescent\nschool gir ull s in wartime Britain provides a classic scenario for a Bunty-style romp,\ncomplete with its ration of Occers, chums\nand posh es. However for some of the time Secret\nPlaces (15) does adopt a more moral tone\ncare of veiled warnings from an ageing\nschoolmarm on lesbian lia sons( causing poor\nPatience to burn the muffins she ws\ntoasting\u2014fiddlesticks!), a gym slip pregnancy, and unsuccessful self-abortion\nfor Nina courtesy of one of the neighbouring\nGIs and the breakdown of Laura's psychosomatic mother after the death of her son, a Luftwaffe pilot who shopped Laura's physicist father to the Nazis, the latter\nsubsequently being detained by the British.\nThe film's fatal flaw is that despite this\nabundance of melodrama and a host of fine\nperformances\u2014especially Marie-Theres\nRelin as Laura, Cassie Stuart as fizzy blonde\nNina, Jenny Agutter as the school teacher\nmuch taken with the poetry of Keats as a substitute for all the young men on the front\nand Tara MacGowran (looking like a freckled\nMeryl Streep) as Patience, the only girl to\nbefriend Laura\u2014Secret Places fails both in\nthe drama and 'absolute hoot and scream'\nstakes. C4's First Love series is in a similar\nvein and has much more to recommend it.\nI FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nMOONEY\nMONOPOLY\nSMASHED!\nThe College has given the go ahead for IC Union to run the refectory in\nthe Union Building next session. The final decision was made at a meeting\nof the Rector's Policy Committee on Tuesday. The Union takeover\nrepresents a radical departure from previous College policy of\nmaintaining a centrally-managed catering service throughout College,\nthe so-called 'Mooney Monopoly'.\nThe Union's aim in running the\nrefectory would be to provide a snack bar outlet with simple hot\nand cold food during the lunch\nperiod and snacks during mid-morning and afternoon sessions.\nExtensive use will be made of\nmicrowave cookers for serving\nhot snacks. Other lines will be\nprepared on-site, eg sandwiches,\nrolls, plough man's lunches, etc.\nThe details of the takeover\nhave still to be worked out\nbetween College and the Union.\nUnder the Union's proposals the\nrefectory will be run by a full time refectory manager and\nan assistant who will be\nemployed during term time only.\nAdditional staff will be employed\non a casual basis. The Union will\noversee the management through\na Catering Committee consisting\nof Union officers and the\nrefectory manager. This committee will be responsible for\noverall policy and long term\nplanning for the outlet, rather\nthan day to day running which\nwill be the responsibility of the\nmanager.\nThe Union Building refectory\nhas been declining in popularity\nfor several years, despite being\nmoved from the present Ents\nMr Mooney at work\n'Lounge Lizards' room to the\nlounge bar two years ago. The\nmove involved considerable\ninvestment by College in\nconstructing a completely new\noutlet in an effort to re vital is e the\nrefectory. However, despite the\nrefectory's facelift the food\nserved remained almost identical\nto that sold in the old outlet and\nthe decline continued. During the\npresent academic year the\nrefectory has made a substantial\nloss and it had been accepted by\nthe College that major changes\nwere necessary and consideration\nhad been given to closing the\nrefectory completely.\nJo Goes!\nRent Increase To\nMatch Grant\nThe College have agreed to keep rent increases down to approximately\n4% for College-owned premises. This figure, which is in line with the\nstudent grant increase, will mean 50p to \u00a31 extra per week for students in\nHalls and Evelyn Gardens. Rents for Head Tenancies are likely to go up\nmore, since increases of up to 10% have been imposed by the landlords.\nThe College has agreed, however, to absorb some of this amount,\nhopefully leading to an increase to the student of less than 10%.\nThe bill for messengers and\nsecurity in Halls is to go to the\nresidence account from now on.\nThe annual cost at present is\nsome \u00a397,000, but Student\nResidence Committee (SRC)\nhave outlined a reduction in\nservice which would lead to an\nannual bill of \u00a342,000. The\nRector has agreed that the\n\u00a355,000 difference will be met out\nof the College account, until the\nreductions in service can be\nachieved by natural wastage.\nThe Rector has also indicated\nthat the two flats in Linstead Hall\nat present occupied by academics\nwill be put at the disposal of the\nSRC as soon as possible. This will\nrelease a number of places for\nstudent use, probably as\naccommodation for married\nstudents. The Penthouse flats in\nSouthside on the other hand,\nseem certain to return to use by\nacademics.\nThe College is at present\nlooking for a new residence for\nbetween 100 and 200 students.\nThis will replace the Fremantle\nHotel, the lease for which expires\nin 1985. In view of the problems\nexperienced with the Fremantle it\nseems unlikely that the lease\nwould be renewed. The properties viewed so far are too\nexpensive to be self-financing if\nrents are to be kept at a reasonable level. It is hoped that\nincome derived from the Summer\nAccommodation Scheme could\nbe used to supplement funds for\nsuch a purchase. Last year the\nscheme raised a record of \u00a398,000\ncompared with less than half that\nfigure in previous years. (For the\nbad news see page 3).\nThe Union's receptionist Jo\nHewanicka left on 4 April to take\nup a job in graphic design. She\nhas been employed by the Union\nfor nearly three years, before\nwhich she worked in the College\nConference Office.\nDuring her time in the Union\nOffice Jo's friendly and helpful\nmanner has been appreciated by\nall those making enquiries in the\noffice.\nIt is not expected that a new\nreceptionist will be appointed\nuntil September. In the meantime\nUnion officers and staff will be\ncovering her duties. It would\ngreatly assist them if all members\nof clubs and societies would\ncheck the Message Book in the\nUnion Office for their messages.\nNo 6731 I FELIX, May 11 1984\\\nOpen at Last\nThe new travel office in the J CR is expected to open on Monday\nafter a week's delay.

    "content": "Storm in a Pewter Pot?\nThe fuss over the AP Editor's pot may seem to many to be a storm in a tea-cup. However the issue is not about a pewter tankard, but about the\nExecutive Committee riding roughshod over the views of other, less illustrious, students involved in the Union. The awarding of pots for established\nposts is a tradition peculiar to this Union. The pot is not given to the person\nholding the post to take away, but stays behind the Union Bar for the use of\nholders of the post, past and present. It is a small way for the Union to\nrecognise a valuable contribution to its running. It is not as if obtaining the\npot would be very expensive, or difficult. All that would be required would be\nfor the Exec to take one of the many pewter pots out of a cupboard in the\nUnion Office and take it downstairs to the Union Bar. One can see how petty\nand thoughtless the Exec's decision not to award the pot is. It seems the effort\nand nara work (quite often into the early hours of the morning) of an\n'ordinary student' counts for very little in the minds of these high flying\nsabbaticals and C CU Presidents.\nThis action merely serves to highlight how lofty and unrepresentative the\nExecutive Committee can be. The committee consists of the three sabbatical\nofficers and the C CU Presidents. Their brief is solely to take decisions\nconcerning the day to day running of the Union or to take immediate\ndecisions in the event of any emergencies. In practice however a lot of very\nimportant decisions concerning the running of the Union are taken at this\ncommittee. This state of affairs was fine in the' days when IC Union was\nmerely a coalition of three CCUs. However since then IC Union has grown,\nbecome more diverse and sophisticated. It has over a hundred clubs and\nsocieties of which the majority of students are a member, yet none of the\nathletics clubs, social clubs, recreational clubs or cultural groups are represented on the Executive Committee.\nBye Bye Mooney\nSherry glasses will be running over today in the Union Office after the taking\nover of the Union Refectory and, for a change, the celebrations are quite\njustified. Well done to Gaynor Lewis and Christine Teller. However, amidst\nthe celebrations a word of caution may be in order.\nCollege have wanted to close the Union Refectory for some time. The\noutlet has been the source of numerous complaints and has lost a great deal of\nmoney in recent years. Although it is difficult to put an exact figure on the size\nI* of the loss because of the confused refectory accounting system it is probably\nover \u00a37,500 per annum. The Union's takeover proposals must have seemed\nlike a God-send to College. One would hope the outlet does not become an\nexpensive millstone around the Union's neck next year. Nevertheless with a little drive and imagination there is no reason why the refectory should not be\nsuccessful and serve as an example to Mr Mooney of how a refectory should\nbe run. -Travel Awards\nIf your annual travel expenses are under \u00a3250 you could find yourself \u00a3150\nout of pocket if Sir Keith Joseph's proposed travel awards go through. There\nis an article about travel awards by Peter Burt on page 11. If you can tear\nyourselves away from your revision for a few hours then do participate in the\nlobby of Parliament on Wednesday. The Union's delegation will be meeting\nin the Union Office at 2:15.\nCredits\nPete Hobbis Nigel Atkinson, Tony Atkins, John Jones, Lynne James, Diane\nLove, John Scott, Ulysess, J Martin Taylor, Dave Rowe, Hugh Soi'hey, PeterRodgers, Maz and Pete.

    "content": "Miscellany\nat a different\nlength than\nusual\nUGM Sketch\nIt is with much regret that the\nU GM Sketch this week will not\nbreak with tradition. In the past\nhalf a page has been written\nabout a three minute meeting\nwhilst the last meeting was\nexcessively long only for the\nsketch to be butchered down to a few column inches. This was\nrather unfortunate as a veritable\nabundance of typically caustic\nMews\nwit was lost, most of it being\ndisparaging remarks about the\nFELIX Editor-elect David Rowe. This \"Guinness-swilling\npenniless nomad\" was one of the\nfew people to attend yesterday's short meeting (someone called\nquorum right at the start) and he\nactually made a disparaging\nremark himself: during informal\ndiscussions about the formation\nof a lunatic fringe at College\nRowe pointed out that such a body already exists (not Consoc,\nSTOIC, WIST or Ladies Rugby)\nbut the Executive (ie the\nsabbaticals and C CU Presidents).\nThose Exec members on show\nyesterday failed to provide\nconclusive evidence for , Mr Rowe's hypothesis\u2014one is\npatently bald anyway and there's nothing wrong with Gaynor's fringe a pair of scissors couldn't cure although Sean Davies recent\ncoiffure has been seen as lunatic\nin some circles. Perhaps no-nonsense DP Christine Teller\ncould have sorted it all out but\nshe was at the dentists prompting\ncomments about \"the horse's mouth\" from one cruel observer.\nChristine\nGuardian\nPraises IC\nImperial College's reply to the\nrecent University Grants Committee (UGC) questionnaire has\nbeen greeted with a chorus of\nsupport from other institutions,\naccording to the Guardian's Education Correspondent John\nFairhall, in an article in the paper\non Tuesday.\nMr Fairhall points out that IC\nhas that combination of high\nacademic standards and industrial relevance that is one of the\nmain aims of the 'Sir Keith\nJoseph selective approach'. He\ngoes on to quote from IC's reply\nto the UGC: \"To expect academic staff to\nwork in deteriorating buildings\nwith obsolescent equipment, to\nteach classes which they know are\ntoo large, and to spend more of\ntheir time chasing grants and\ncontracts and doing work that\nshould have been done by non-existant secretaries or technicians\nis to use inefficiently the most\nexpensive resource higher\neducation.\"\nThe message coming from IC\nand from other institutions is that\nthe Government's higher education policy is too crude in its\ndefinition and application. There\nis also a call for better science and\nmaths facilities in schools in\norder to attract more good\nstudents to take these subjects,\nresulting in more highly qualified\napplicants to places like IC. This\ncomes in the face of the present\nGovernment's policy for the\nfunding of education which\nseems certain to continue to\nerode the service at all levels.\nCastaways Washed up\nin Piccadilly toilet\nThe IC Union Office was broken\ninto early on Friday morning last\nweek and the trophy cabinet was\nbroken into. Only one trophy, the\n'Castaways Cup', was stolen and\nthis was later recovered by Vine\nStreet police after being found in\nthe public lavatories at Piccadilly\nCircus.\nThe thieves are thought to have\nmade their entry through the\nSenior Common Room and the\nHon See's Office. They then\nsmashed the glass-fronted trophy\ncabinet, activating the burglar\nalarm.\nSecurity staff in Beit Quad\nmistook this for the ladies' toilet\nrape alarm, although the control\nboard has two lights to indicate\nwhich of the alarms has been\nactivated. Security immediately\nvisited the toilets but on finding\nnothing amiss left without check-ing the Union Office. Consequently, the thieves were\nnot challenged and made a free\nget-away.\nOfficers from the local constabulary investigated the theft\non Friday afternoon, assisted by\nIC security. The news of the\ntrophy's recovery came early in\nthe same evening from the\nUniversity of London Union. It\nwas handed in by a member of the\npublic to the police who returned\nit to UL U since it is a University\ntrophy. The trophy stolen was\none of the least valuable and a number of solid silver cups were\nleft behind. The 'Castaways Cup'\nis an inter-college trophy, held at\npresent by IC Sailing Club.\nThe present alarm system in\nthe Union Building was installed\nafter \u00a35,000 worth of trophies\nwere stolen in August 1980.\nThese trophies were never re-covered, and the present display\nconsists of replicas. There are\nnow plans to replace the present\ntrophy cabinet alarm system with\none independent of the rape\nalarm.\nOBITUARY\nMark Simms, who graduated from the Electrical Engineering\ndepartment last year, was killed in a road accident on 27 March.\nMark was a very active student who was popular with both\nfellow students and lecturers. He was STOIC Treasurer for\ntwo years and was awarded social colours for his services to\nthat society. He left College to work as an engineer for the BBC\nat Television Centre and such was his interest in television that\nhe and three colleagues formed their own video production\ncompany while still at College.\nHe will be greatly missed by his family, friends and\ncolleagues.\nMartin Cowan\nThe Bad\nNews\nStudents living in London o yer the Christmas and Easter\nvacations could be seriously out\nof pocket if new DHS S proposals\nto stop them claiming benefit\nover the vacation are approved ,\nby the Government. The\nproposals are conf i denial at\npresent, but were published in the\nGuardian on Wednesday.\nAt present if you are paying\nrent whilst staying in your flat or\nroom during the short vacations\nyou can claim the whole of your\nrent back in housing benefit.\nDuring term time you can only\nclaim if your rent (not including\nrates, electricity, etc) is over\n\u00a319.45 per week, and some\nstudents are able to claim a few\npounds. The new proposals will\nallow claims if the residual rent is\nabove \u00a315.35 per week, but this\nfigure will apply during the short\nvacations as well. In addition it is\nproposed that rates will be taken\ninto account in a different way\nresulting in a reduction in the\namount paid in benefit.\nThe result will be that those\nstudents who can presently claim\nduring term time will continue to\nbe paid this benefit through the\nvacations, but will not be eligible\nto claim more during vacations.\nOthers unable to claim in term\ntime will not be able to claim\nback their vacation rents. These\nchanges will cost some students\nwell over \u00a3100 per year in lost\nbenefits.\nUnion Welfare Advisor Karen\nStott expressed concern about\nthe new proposals. She said the\nGovernment was already planning big cuts in housing\nbenefit in November and these\nnew proposals were in addition to\nthose. She will be monitoring the\nsituation carefully over the\ncoming months to assess how\nany changes will affect IC\nstudents.\nThese proposals follow the\nGovernment's recent announcement that the system of claiming\ntravelling expenses will be\nchanged next year. A flat rate of\n\u00a3100 per student (\u00a3160 for those\nliving at home) is to be added to\nthe grant, and no additional\nclaim will be possible unless you\nspend more than \u00a3250 on travel.\nThese new arrangements do not\napply to those living in Scotland,\nwho can claim as at present.

    "content": "THE GAS PEOPLE\nUORKING FOR TOMORROWS\nUORLD TODAY\nIf your home uses gas \u2014 and the chances are it\nwill, since British Gas is the largest single supplier\nof heat in Britain \u2014 then you are benefiting from\nyesterday's planning and investment in advanced\ntechnology by the gas people.\nYesterday's research anticipated the needs of\ntoday's customers, and some of the developments\nproduced by the gas people were revolutionary.\nDid you know, for instance, that the gas people\nhelped to pioneer the technology for transporting\ngas across the world's oceans \u2014 gas which would\notherwise be wastefully flared-off? This was done\nby cooling the gas into liquid form at minus 160\u00b0C and carrying it in specially designed tankers. The\ntransportation of LNG is now a major world trade.\nThe gas people also saw opportunities in newly\navailable gas-making feedstocks and developed the\nCatalytic Rich Gas process for making gas from oil,\nrather than coal. Advances like these underpinned\nthe transformation of an ageing industry into a highly competitive and rapidly expanding modern\nbusiness.\nThe gas people went on to exploit the natural gas\nwhich they had helped to discover around our\nshores. To achieve this they constructed a network of\nunderground high pressure steel pipelines to the\nhighest standards. A great deal of money and technical expertise were expended in devising a means of\ninspecting these pipelines, and a sophisticated\nelectronic and mechanical device called an\n'intelligent pig' was developed. It works inside the\npipeline while the gas is still flowing.\nTOMORROW'S WORLD\nYesterday, the gas people solved what would\nhave been today's problems, and we've given you\njust a few examples. But you may be more interested\nin the work we're doing today to solve tomorrow's. For instance, in readiness for the time when\nBritain's indigenous supplies of natural gas begin to\ndecline, and nobody knows when that will be, the gas\npeople have already developed the technology for\nproducing substitute natural gas from coal. The\nresults of this pioneering work are being viewed with\ngreat interest in many parts of the world. Whichever\nfeedstock is available at a competitive price, however,\nthe gas people intend to have the technology to\nproduce a substitute natural gas from it.\nAnd because gas will still be there for\ntomorrow's customers, the gas people are helping to\ndevelop a new generation of appliances for to-morrow's low-energy homes. They are starting to\napply ways of recuperating waste heat in industrial\nand commercial applications by using gas engine-driven heat pumps. These reverse the normal process by which heat flows from a high temperature\nto a lower and so can consume less energy than they\ndeliver! The gas people are even looking at new ways\nto avoid traffic congestion \u2014 by replacing\nunderground gas pipes without the need for digging\nup the road!\nMuch more is going on besides, so if you'd like to\nfind out about today's high-tech gas industry, write\nto the Public Relations Department, British Gas,\nRivermill House, 152 Grosvenor Road, London\nSW1V 3J L.
