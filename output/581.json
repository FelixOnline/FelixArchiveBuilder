    "content": "Sit\nI was disgusted with last week's FELIX( no 580) and dissociate\nmyself from it entirely. It was a disgrace to the whole College and\nbrought shame on the office you\nbear as Editor. Despite your persistent efforts, you were not\nelected to drag our newspaper\ndown to all-time low standards,\nregardless of whether these\nstandards are your own: you\nwere elected to be Editor to the\n\"newspaper of Imperial College\nUnion\". In your editorial last week you\nexpressed the belief that \"the\nmajority of students enjoy reading the kind of FELIX( you)\nenjoy producing\" \u2014 you were\nobviously neglecting your capacity to offend the decency of most\npeople when selecting the front\ncover. You also seem to have\n\"forgotten\" the outrage, hurt\nand in furia t ion you have purposely\ncaused in past issues. It seems to\nhave been your policy to cause\nsensations of the most distasteful\nkind, without any regard to the\nmeans employed and, in part icu lar, to the persons maligned.\nI sincerely hope that your successor pursues a more satisfactory editorial policy, which,\nunder the regrettable c irc um stances, could hardly be difficult.\nI also trust that he may be able to\nrepair some of the substantial\ndamage you have caused during\nyour unfortunate tenure of office.\nTonv Leech\nMat Sci PC Sir\nThe irony of your headline\nover such a disgusting picture\n( FELIX580) only reinforces\nevidence that if FELIX had any\ncredibility left within IC or the\npublic at large after recent editorials, it has surely vanished\nnow.\nEven if the C ND campaign\nsuccessfully removed all weapons\nfrom the face of the earth, Britain\nwill eventually cripple itself\nwith its immorality and godless-ness. Many countries survive war\n\u2014 but none survive once gripped\nby immorality. Mary Whitehouse\nis a courageous, and far-sighted\nlady. She has courage which puts\nmany men to shame.\nThe Bible says \" The fear ol\nGod is the beginning ol wisdom\",\nand Mary Whitehouse is a wise\nlady indeed. She often stands\nalone in her fight to keep filth out\nof the media and though she will\nbe ridiculed by mankind, she is\ncertain ol commendation from\nGod: \" il you suffer as a Christian,\ndo not be ashamed, but praise\nGod that you bear that Name.\n. For it is time lor judgement to\nbegin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will\nthe outcome be far those who do\nnot obey the Gospel of God?\" The fool will say in his heart\n\"there is no God\" so that he can\nindulge in immorality. The Christian, however, has a glorious hope and purpose in living.\nWe do not place ourselves above-anyone else, but we proclaim\nwhat we know to be true. The\nword of God is the truth about\nman, and I personally believe\nand stake my life on what He says, from Genesis, to Revelations.\nDR Morris\nCiv En gPG Sir\nI would like to make it clear\nthat I am not the author of the\nletter from Eric the Mutilated\nCamel in last week's FELIX. Iam neither artiodactyl nor mutilated, and though Iam known as \" Eric\", it is merely a nickname, hence the quotation\nmarks. I agree with the contents\nol the letter and was revolted by\nthe ill-informed, malicious and\ndare I say, unchristian attack\nmade on Mr Marshall by that\nretro min gent, semi sentient, simian David Vinnegar. Despite\nthis I do not believe in filling\nFELIX' s letters page with abuse,\neven on subjects as tempting as\nignorant and long winded as\nDennis Vinnegar.\nI do not like people leaning out\nof Linstead Extension windows\naccusing me of writing such\ntrivial, abusive and tedious drivel\nand so, I repeat, I am not Erie\nthe Mutilated Came l.I am Sir,\n} our obedient servant\nE Jarvis \u2014 only (23-).\nDear Sieve\nI would like to use your columns to reply to the accusations levelled at me by the\nLabour Club in last week's FELIX. In reply to Mr R Alexander and Mr Gun a war dena's letter, I would like to\npoint out that I do know what I said. The topic of debate with Mr Price was whether to send talented children to special schools or comprehensives which,.\nI said, \" would reduce them to the\nlevel ol simian morons like you\"( and I have at least one other\nwitness to bear me out on this). I can only conclude that you either\ngenuinely mis heard what I said\nat the time or that you have\ndeliberately chosen to misquote\nme. In the former case, I will\napologise to you lor any offence\ncaused with the proviso that you\napologise firstly for the libellous\ncomments that you wrote last\nweek. In the latter case, all I can\nadvise you to do is 'Go forth and\nmultiply' in half as many words.\nConcerning Mr Kellerman's letter I would like to state firstly\nthat I am not a Tory pro pagan dist. Secondly, the report was not\na criticism of the Labour Club but rather a comment on the\nspeaker \u2014 had Mr Carlisle chosen to make the numerous\nrash comments that his counterpart made, I would not have\nhesitated in criticizing him. I do\nfeel however that the report was\ntoo subjective and my apologies\nto anyone who found the humour\nin anyway distasteful.\nfours sincerely\nA J Amro lia Physics 1\nPS: Now that you know my\nsurname, you might as well know\nthat my friends call me Zar but\nyou can call me Mr A mio lia, Gunawardena\nDear Sir\nWith reference to Mr Bedding's letter last week ( FELIX580)'. I would like to thank him for\nconceding that his article was a subjective report \u2014 it would have been worrying had he\nclaimed his opinions were the\ntrue facts.\nThe point ol'his letter appeared\nto be that \" Bir Zeit's existence is\nbeing threatened\" by the Israelis.\nThis statement, coming from\nsomeone aware of the facts,\namazes me. As Mr Bedding is\nwell aware (I'm assuming he was\nat the meeting his original article\nadvertised) Bir Zeit and the other\nthree universities on the West\nBank were created by the Israeli\nParliament. Surely the setting up\nof educational institutions such as\nthese is an act of peace in itself\nand therefore could not be\nconsidered the action of a hostile\ngovernment. The answer is self-evident.\nl ours sincerely\nJonathan M Miller Dear Comrade Editor\nOnce again I see the Campaign lor National Disaster( C ND) has been rearing its ugly\nbead on your pages. This dis-gusted, or perhaps disgusting comrade has obviously never left\nthe lower echelon of the Physics\ndepartment.\nDoes he seriously believe that\nthe enormous Soviet presence/\ndomination in Eastern Europe is\npurely decorative, and that the\nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan\nwas purely a Christmas present\nfor President Brezhnev.\nThe Soviet threat, comrades, is\nthere and real, and we must light\nto contain it. Our freedom is\nmore important than the ego\ntrips of various politicos who would probably state that the\nUSA was a greater enemy to\ndemocracy than the USSR just\nto gain a bit of cheap publicity.\nWe must fight hard against\nthese individuals who wish to rob\nus of our national pride and\nidentity. Freedom, comrades, is\nthe only thing worth fighting for.\n.No surrender\nComrade Bill the Mole Dear Sir\nThe final section of your editorial last week left me with a cold feeling in my stomach. Being\nquite sure that you would not\npublish information which you\nknew to be untrue, I can only\nassume that you have hired a group of people to follow me\nabout and monitor my movements from day to day. I used to\nleave the curtains in my room\nopen most of the time, but it\nseems this will have to change.\nBut, Steve I'm afraid your team\nof private detectives has passed\nyou something less than the\ntruth. I have spent some fifteen\nhours of my time on writing things for The Phoenix this term\nalone, and the lack of said material in the editor's hands is\ndue to self criticism. Sell criticism is not of course a subject\nI would expect you to know much about.\n} ours sincerely\nKC Mann Ed's. Note\nDear Ken, accept my apologies, I have maligned you.\nPlease, in future, apply the\nsame self criticism to SF Soc\narticles written for FELIX. Thank you.\nDear Sir\nRe your editorial, FELIX580.

Questioned the antics of the Rugby Club\nand their free spending \u2014 and\ntheir annual \"loss\" of shirts.\nRemember the hassle caused by the\nCaptain of Volleyball concerning the new court \u2014 yet have\nreceived no articles from his\nClub all year.\nCongratulate the Football Club on an amazingly successful season (five\nof their six teams winning their\nleagues) and the Hockey Club\non the performance of their\nfirst team.\nThank all the clubs and individuals\nwho have sent in articles, with\nspecial thanks to Jim Beer for\nhis excellent reports.\nAm Trying to find a Sports Editor for next\nsession (see below).\nIC Sailing Win\nBradford Barrel\nIC mustered their strongest team, calling on\ntheir ULSC sailors (Ajderian, Baxter, Lewis)\nto compete in the Bradford Barrel. This is a prestigious international event in which the\ninvited universities compete for a barrel\nduring two days of debauchery.\nBeing Friday 13 however, all was not well. A transport and monetary problem started the\nball rolling. After a famous Bradford curry,\nthe team returned in a merry spirit to discover\nthat Ajderian's van had been stolen from the\nUniversity car park. Five members' sailing\ngear, sleeping bags, etc., and vital coursework were taken with the van.\nThe first race against the Dutch team\nresulted in a procession in the light airs with\nMurray and the reserve Younghusband\nleading the pack. Baxter and Chadwick\nlooked uncomfortable in second place as\nposing became very difficult in the becalmed\nconditions. Ajderian and Kennedy took third.\nLewis became a hero and sailed in all the\nother races, leading IC to five convincing\nvictories out of five, in the freshening breeze.\nSunday started with most of the IC team\njoining the Chunder boat and a victory\nagainst Edinburgh. The 'biggie' was against\nLiverpool, which due to lack of concentration\nIC were marginally defeated. All was not lost\nas Salford beat Liverpool in the next race.\nEverything hinged on the last race between\nIC and Salford. Lewis and Murray would have\nset up an excellent start had they not been\ntoo early, confusion led to Murray and Baxter\nrestarting in fifth and sixth. Baxter and\nChadwick produced some skilful tacking and\nwith the aid of Lewis they sailed into first and\nsecond positions at the windward mark but\njust as easily lost it again. Salford took a green but were now winning on the water and\nwere so, until Murray managed to slip into\nthird place on the line following Lewis to give\nIC 2, 3, 4 and the Barrel.\nThe team would like to thank Bradford for\nputting on a splendid weekend and for\nhelping us out with the kit. Our valueless\nteam coach, Paul Burton and the Bradford\ncurries also deserve a mention for providing\nso much entertainment.\nTEAM: Ajderian, Baxter, Chadwick,\nKennedy, Lewis, Murray. Reserve: Younghusband. Coach: Burton.\nLadies Rugby\nWin Plate\nAT 8:00 on Sunday morning the intrepid\nladies' rugby 14 set off for the Second Annual\nLoughborough Women's Rugby Tournament.\nTwelve teams took part, including Santa\nMonica, an American team who are currently\ntouring England. We were unlucky to draw\nSanta Monica in the first round, when we\nwere beaten 22-0. Santa Monica went on to\nwin the Whitbread Trophy.\nWe were now in the plate competition,\nwhere we had a bye in the first round, and\nthen played Keele in the semi-final. We were\nthe dominant team throughout the match,\nwinning almost all the set pieces. They\ndefended well however and we could not\nquite break through to score. Andree was\nunlucky not to be awarded a try, when the\ntouch judge thought she put her foot in touch\njust before grounding the ball in the corner.\nThere was no score at the end, so the game\nhad to be decided on place kicks, as they\nwould not allow us to play extra time. Then\nsome good kicking by Andree decided the\nmatch for us, taking us to the final of the\nplate.\nIn the final we met York, whose very strong\npack gave us some trouble initially. However\nwe all played very hard and soon began to\ndominate the match. Again we were unlucky\nnot to score, and this match too was decided\non place kicks, where Andree again converted\nthe deciding goal, making IC the winners of\nthe plate. Thanks must go to all who played\nand also to our very noisy supporters.\nTEAM: Lois, Steph, Jane, Pam, Sara,\nAndree, Mary (Capt), Rad, Sabs, Big Les,\nHelen, Cathy, Jenny, Ruth.\nBasketball\nBASKETBALL practices will be held in the first\nweek of next term on Monday and Thursday.\nMake sure you're there; competition in second\nweek.\nCricket\nTHE Cricket Club trials will be held on\nWednesday, April 29 at Harlington. Those\nwishing to attend should sign the notice\noutside of the Union Bar.\nWe will, during the whole of next term, be\nrunning two Xls on a Wednesday and\nSaturday with a possible third XI if demand is\nsufficient. A Sunday XI will play during the\nwhole of the summer, and although this is\nintended mainly for PGs is open to all club\nmembers. Anyone wishing to play on\nSundays should contact Dr Dave Chadwick\nof Chemical Engineering.\nWill anyone wishing to play at all next term,\nhowever infrequently, please fill in the\navail abilities chart on the noticeboard outside\nthe Union Bar. This will make our team\nselections (Monday and Thursday lunch-times) much easier at a time when many\npeople are not in College all of the time.\nI hope that as many people as are able will\nfind time to turn out and enable us to fulfil all\nof our fixtures during the busy exam season.\nExperience has shown that an afternoon\nplaying cricket is an ideal way of keeping\nyourself from becoming totally bogged down\nby revision, etc.\nSo dig out your whites and bring them to\nCollege. Even if you only intend playing a couple of games, we will be glad to see you as\nthe more people playing for the club the\neasier it is to fulfil our fixtures and\nkeep the club going.\nMartin Ellacott\nFootball Sixths\nIC sixths team in only their second season of\nLeague football have won the 5R lower\nreserves league having only dropped three\npoints and scored thirty-five goals.\nTop of the goalscorers was Roche with a remarkable twenty goals including three\nha tricks. The Sixths were fortunate that\nChamberlain's fiancee allowed him to play\nbecause he scored twelve goals. Although\nthey only scored two goals each, Davis and\nCoussens created many chances with their\nruns down the right wing.\nThe Sixths had a settled midfield all season;\nMilner scored three goals, Gartside's fierce\ntackling and consistent effort earned him a regular place and Tinkler kept getting picked\nfor no apparent reason but did manage to\nscore two goals.\nThe defence were rarely troubled by the\nopposition. Higham dominated the right side\nof defence, Nagle's composure steadied the\ndefence until his unfortunate leg injury,\nMaynard added his experience and tackling\nability. Haberlin defended well and managed\nto score twice, Davies even played when it\nwas cold. The goalkeeper Hampton managed\nto shrug off his Scottish connections and\nproduced some extremely vital saves.\nMany thanks to the other players who\nplayed for the Sixths: Audin, Clegg, Martin,\nCaseau, Flynn and Hall.\nSailing\nTHE Sailing Club has enjoyed an active\nseason, participating in the South East\nUniversities League and a number of other\nevents.\nUnfortunately, it has not been possible to\ncomplete the League programme due to lack\nof time and our final position is likely to be\naffected. The team this year has consisted\nalmost entirely of first years, and often losing\nnearly all the matches in the first term, our\nresults this term have been much better.\nIn June, an IC team took part in the\nColraine 24-hour race, finishing third overall.\nAt the Firefly National Championships in\nSeptember, three IC boats participated. Dave\nDerby finished first, Chris Lewis ninth, and\nJames Baxter eighteenth in a fleet of 100.\nIn October the Firefly Inland Championships were held at the Welsh Harp, and four\nIC boats entered, with James Baxter gaining\nthe highest position, fourth overall.\nOur first team event was the Foot Trophy,\nalso in October. The team did not fair\nparticularly well, but gained much experience\nagainst strong opposition.\nPerhaps the most important event this year\nhas been the Castaways Cup, in which all the\nLondon colleges participate. Two IC teams\nentered, the first team winning the event, and\nthe second team finishing fifth.\nSports Editor\nIT IS normally the role of Vice-Chairman of\nACC to act as Sports Editor. If there is\nanybody sufficiently interested in sport at IC\nrather than the organisation of ACC then next\nyear's FELIX Editor, Mark Smith is more than\nkeen for them to do the job.\nI suspect that Mark's attitude will be the\nsame as Steve Marshall's this year; that is, he\nis VERY keen for a sports section but not\no eing interested in sport himself requires\nle lp. If you are interested, drop into the FELIX\nOffice and see me sometime or better still,\ncome along to Falmouth 132 for a cup of\ncoffee and I 'll tell you what you're letting\nyourself in for.\nPhil\nFELIX, March 20,1981 Page 7\n\n"

    "content": "AntiApartheid\nIN RESPONSE to an overwhelming vote at an IC\nU GM and following pressure from the Association\nof University Teachers, the meeting of the Board\nof Governors at the end of last term discussed the\nadmission of South African students to the MSc\ncourse in Nuclear Fuels Technology. Under\npressure from the Rector, the meeting decided to\ncontinue the present policy of admitting Souf\nAfrican students. Earlier this term, re pre se it at ive groups from AUT and ICU (including Joh\nPassmore) were invited to discuss with the Recto:\nhis objections to their proposals.\nBriefly, these were:\n1. The Nuclear Technology course is not\ndirectly applicable to the production of nuclear\nweapons.\n2. The exclusion of students from any course\nwas an infringement of academic freedom.\n3. Exlusions of students from a course at IC\nwould only send them elsewhere and would not\nreally affect South Africa's progress towards the\nbomb.\nOur criticisms of these points may be\nsummarised as follows:\n1. This course inevitably has a close\nconnection with nuclear industry, and associated\ntechniques will be adapted for the production of\nweapons grade fuel \u2014 and expertise thus\nprovided to South Africa will be a real\nencouragement towards the development of the\napartheid bomb.\n2. The anti-apartheid movement has details of\nplans made by the South African government for\ndetonation, of nuclear explosions within South\nAfrica aimed at areas of black population.\n3. South Africa is at present at war with\nneighbouring black states of Mozambique,\nAngola and Zambia and has stated that it is\nprepared to use extreme measures to maintain its\nsecurity.\n4. Academic freedom must be quant at ive, and\nby supporting the security of the present South\nAfrican regime we support the exclusion of a large majority of its population from the academic\nfreedom that we expect.\n5. IC has in its hands the means to demonstrate support for UN resolutions deploring\nnuclear collaboration with South Africa, and to\nhave a real affect on the rate of nuclear arms\npro life rti on( and hence world peace) and on an\ninhuman, racist and undemocratic regime.\nBob Hughes, MP, Chairman of the AntiApartheid Movement recently received a letter\nExternal Affairs\nTHE ELECTIONS for the posts of secretary and\nfour ordinary members of the External Affairs\nCommittee are to be held at the first UGM of\nnext term, on Thursday, April 30. Papers are now\nup on the noticeboard in the Lower Lounge.\nThe Committee's tasks as I see them are\nmainly: the discussion and formulation of draft\npolicy on issues affecting students which are\noutside College, e.g. grants, overseas students'\nfees, etc.; the coordination of relations with\noutside bodies, especially student bodies such as\nULU and NUS, and also the University of London\nauthorities. There are other areas (external affairs\nis a very general brief) but these are the main\nones.\nThe secretary and four ordinary members,\ntogether with the President, EAO and ULU\nRepresentative, form the ICU delegation to ULU\nGeneral Union Council (GUC), formerly SRC.\nThis is the central policy making body of ULU,\nand has an executive including three sabbaticals.\nIt consists of delegates from all colleges in the\nUniversity, and meets about two or three times a term. It provides an opportunity for IC students\nto see what.real union hacks are like, being much\nmore openly political than ICU. The IC delegation\nis often an 'oasis of reason amidst a desert of\nextremism', or put in a less literary way we are\nfrom the United Nations Special Committee\nagainst Apartheid specifically on the subject of\nthe IC'situ t ation. The letter expressed total support for the Antiapartheid movement on this issue, and\nspecifically commended both ICU and the IC\nbranch of AUT \"for demanding an end to the\ntraining of South African nuclear physic ts\". The IC Anti-Apartheid Group intends to\ncontinue its campaign with a petition in College\nprior to a fresh approach to the Board of\nGovernors and Board of Studies, and has\nprepared a form letter for individuals to send to\ntheir home MPs to encourage raising the question\nin the House of Commons.\nDear Mr Hughes\nI have received your letter of 19 January1981 concerning the actions of the Anti-Apartheid Movement\n(a) with respect to the advertisement in the Daily\nTelegraph by the Electricity Supply Commission of\nSouth Africa and the South African Atomic Energy\nBoard for nuclear technicians and engineers; and (b) the\ntraining of South African nuclear physicist in reactor\nphysics at Imperial College.\nI believe that these advertisements and training\ncourses raise issues of great magnitude.\nAssistance to the racist regime in South Africa in the\nnuclear field is clearly a flagrant violation of numerous\nresolutions of the United Nations. It is, moreover, a hostile act against the oppressed majority in South Africa\nand, indeed, against all African states which have sought\nthe de nuclear iz ation of Africa with a view to make their\ncontinent free from nuclear we a pns. Arguments based\non distinction between so called\" peaceful\" and \"military\" developments are little more than sophistry\nsince the Pretoria regime is feverishly trying to acquire\nnuclear weapon capability in defiance of appeals by the\nWestern Powers themselves.\nI am surprised that the United Kingdom Government\nhas not taken action to stop all nuclear collaboration\nwith South Africa. It was twenty years ago that the South\nAfrican regime left the Commonwealth in order to\ncontinue racist domination without hindrance, and yet\nSouth Africa seems to continue to enjoy special\nprivileges in many ways comparable, if not better, than\nshe used to enjoy as a Member of the Commonwealth, to\nthe detriment of the most vital interests of the South\nAfrican people and the independent African States. One\nwould have thought that Governments which profess\nconcern for peaceful solutions and even oppose armed\nresistance by the oppressed people, would at least be\nscrupulous in denying assistance to the racist regime.\nIam heartened by the commendable vigilance and\nactions of the Anti Apartheid Movement to stop\ncollaboration with South Africa. I would also like to\ncommend, on behalf of the Special Committee against\nApartheid, the Students' Union at Imperial College and\nthe Imperial College Branch of the Association of\nUniversity Teachers for demanding an end to the\ntraining of South African nuclear physicists.\nI wish to assure you that the Special Committee will\ngive utmost attention to the information provided by you\nwith a view to further action.\nYours since rly B Akporode Clark\nChairman, Special Committee Against Apartheid\noften the only major college to put forward\npragmatic views. However, if you enjoy political\ndebating then it can be fun, and it gives an\nopportunity to meet people from other colleges.\nIf you are interested in standing for the\nCommittee then please ask either John Passmore\nor myself for further details. However, before you\ndo consider it, please make sure that you are\nprepared to attend meetings (or at least send\napologies). You cannot expect to sit on a committee without putting some time and effort\nin, so be prepared to do your bit. Having said that\nI would like to encourage as many people as\npossible to stand, it is a good 'first' Union post as\nit is often better to have had no previous\nexperience and so be able to put forward a new\nopinion on things.\nMartin Taylor\nExternal Affairs Officer\nSFSoc\nThis bulletin was not by Ken Mann and has\nhence been edited down as it did not come up to\nKen's usual high standard.\nThere is a BSFA Meeting on Friday, March 20.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nMINERS\nMINUS\nMASCOT\nIn a daring night-time raid on the Mines Building on Tuesday\nnight, the RCS mascot ry group succeeded in violating Davy, the\nMines mascot.\nAt a press conference called at 1:30am on Wednesday morning, Rich Archer issued the following statement.\n\"Following discreet observation at the Royal School of Mines\nElection U GM last Tuesday, the location of the Mines mascot, Davy,\nwas ascertained by the Royal College of Science Union mascot ry team,\notherwise known as Montysoc. Later that night, the location was\nvisited by the RCS team, and the mascot was removed from the\nbuilding with negligible damage. Afterwards, it was whisked away to a secret destination. Ransom details will be issued to the Royal School of\nMines Union next term.\nHave a nice Davy.\nRich Archer and Paul Johnson\"\nOn Wednesday morning more information was given to FELIX by\nan anonymous team member.\nFor the last five years, there has been a substantial amount of\nresearch carried out by R CSU, observing Mines UG Ms and picking\nup clues. After the Election U GM last Tuesday the team decided to\nmake a raid that evening. A group of between five and ten people from\nthe RCS Metal Collection and Appreciation Society affected an entry\nto a locker in a first floor room in the Mines Building (Davey was also\ntaken from this location the last time it was violated by Guilds). The\ngroup went outside and placed Davy in the RCS J4, and it was\nremoved to an undisclosed destination. The whole operation took only\ntwelve minutes. On the way out, the group was spotted by night\nsecurity, but no one remained to explain what was going on.\nThe Chief Security Officer, Mr Reeves, spoke to FELIX on\nWednesday afternoon. He realised that violating Davy was probably\nthe stunt of the year, but the students should have told the guard what\nwas happening. Part of a security guard's job would be to apprehend\npeople making off with brass fit ment s, he added. Students on this kind\nof stunt should think more about the consequences of their actions.\nMines Union have not at this stage, made any official comment to\nFELIX, although rumours have been circulated suggesting R CSU have got the wrong Davy. R CSU deny this resolutely.\nv.I \u2122'it'J',*' DAILY I. XPRES.\nHOY l.\\I.V Dauy's forerunner, Davy pictured with a newspaper the last time it was\nviolated, in 1974. This is the first time that the present Davy has been\nviolated.\nCunning Stunts\n\u2022 The relationship between IC and Chelsea has deteriorated since IC pulled out of NUS and Chelsea broke off the reciprocal arrangements.\nLast week, students had tried to kidnap Rae Snee, but were trounced\nby Ms Snee, and a companion. On Thursday evening students arrived\nat IC Radio's studios beneath Southside. Claiming to be on a Chelsea\nrag stunt, they occupied the studio and tried to get \" on the air\". Fortunately, the Station Manager, Dave Fuller, was able to take the\nstation off the air so as to stop listeners being offended by crudities from\nnon-IC students. College security and police arrived to remove the\ninvaders from the premises.\nOn Friday afternoon students arrived at the Guilds Union Office,\nclaiming to be on a rag stunt from Barts. They untruthfully said there\nwas a skirmish between Guilds and Barts students outside. Mr Gayer\nwas accompanied outside by Guilds persons (who outnumbered the\nChelsea/ QE Crag gers) when he went to investigate. Outside was a van,\ninto which it had been intended to bundle Dave. But for the Guilds\nstalwarts it seems likely Dave would have been 'nabbed'.\nAt the same time as this, yet more students on a rag stunt arrived at\nthe R CSU Olfice intending to remove Barney McCabe and Phil Thomas.\nThey firstly asked for some signs from the R CSU Office but these were\nrefused. Then the two victims were taken outside and put in a red\ntransit van.\nThey were taken to Chelsea and then to QE C. Steve Tyson. RC SHon Sec, telephoned QE C to explain that a\" ransom\" would not be\npaid. After this, Messrs McCabe and Thomas were locked in a downstairs room at QE C. However, there was another exit from the\nroom, namely an unlocked door which they were told not to try. It did\nnot take long for the intrepid two to figure out an escape and return to\nIC in a taxi. QE C had intended to publicly humi late the IC students\non Saturday's joint QE C/ Chelsea rag procession to end their rag week.\nThe tables were successfully turned however, when a group of IC students arrived at the procession and pelted everyone with 151bs of\nflour.

    "content": "Small Ads Council Report\nICU Council had a turgid and acrimonious meeting on Monday\nevening. The meeting discussed FELIX finances, OSC\nfinances, the Union response to Swinnerton Dyer, and a motion of criticism in the three sabbatical officers.\nThe meeting opened shortly after 6:00pm, and under matters arising\nfrom the minutes of the last meeting, John Passmore suggested that an editorial remark in FELIX suggesting that the affiliation to WU S was\nunconstitutional was incorrect. Jon Firth, Publications Board Chairman, outlined some of the reasons offered for FELIX expenditure\nduring the year.\nThe Deputy President stated that the HOST library will stay in the\nsame place as before. On London Student Travel, she outlined\nproposals from the non-student directors to remove the student\ndirectors from the Board.\nIn the Hon See's report it was suggested that the ballot papers in single transferable vote elections should contain voting instructions.\nThe Hon Sec mentioned a film \" Not Tonight\", which illustrates some\nproblems of students would be shown if enough interest developed in it.\nThe OS C Chairman' s report was referred back, and a full\nbreakdown financial situation (\u00a3200 in the red) was asked for.\nThe meeting then discussed a motion to Council from Publications\nBoard which criticised the Deputy President, Rachel Snee. Mark Smith, FELIX Editor-elect, spoke to the motion, which was in reply to\na previous motion at the last Council which condemned \" in the\nstrongest possible terms\" the way money had been misspent by FELIX stall, on office furnishings, refreshments and Conference fees. The motion was discussed thoroughly, with contributions coming in particular from Mark Clegg. Rae Snee spoke against the motion, and defended her action at the last Council. The whole matter revolved\naround, firstly, the Editor sanctioning payment for equipment during\nthe summer and at other times, without proceeding through the\ncorrect channels, and secondly, the Deputy President bringing the\nmatter to Council's attention when it should have been dealt with in\nthe committee of first instance, namely Publications Board, and without informing the accused of the original Council motion so they\ncould be present to advocate their side of the case. The motion\ncriticising Rae Snee was passed. (The original motion put to Council by Rae\nSnee was not reported in FELIX as Mark Smith had complained to the Elections\nCommittee that it biased the election - Ed.)\nMark Clegg, presenting the P WP report, said they were looking into\nhaving a woman's rep on PVVP. Barney McCabe suggested a Gaysoc\nrep and a yellow trousers rep, but after discussion from Mr Clegg Mr McCabe revealed that he had not been quite serious in his suggestion.\nP WP was also looking into student representation on Joint College\nCommittees.\nThe meeting went into closed session. When it was reopened to\nobservers, it was agreed to ask the Handbook Editor to extend the copy\ndeadline to the end of the first week of term.\nIn answer to a question, John Passmore said that he expected bar\nprices to remain down until next term.\nThe meeting then discussed the Union's repo nse to the SwinnertonDyer report and asked lor a redrafting of a statement presented to\nCouncil.\nWhen everyone thought the meeting was drawing to a close. Bob\nBradley. Academic Affairs Officer, proposed a motion of censure in this\nyear's three sabbatical officers, for not bringing next year's estimates to\nCouncil's attention before they were submitted to College. Rae Snee\nhad le lt the meeting. John Passmore felt he had done nothing wrong,\nand Liz Lindsay said it was policy not to photocopy more than twenty\nsheets of anything. Nick Morton, ICU President-elect, said he would\nresign if he was placed in a similar situation next year. Jen Hardy Smith said it would mean more work for the permanent staff, if the full\nestimates were presented at the meeting. It was emphasised that the\nestimates were updated as recently as Friday, with the additional\nfurther claims. Mr Bradley, who referred to the ICU Blue Book during\nhis submissions, altered the motion to one of reprimand. The meeting\n\\o ted711 not to pass the motion. After further minor points, the\nunsettled meeting closed.\nInformed sources told FELIX Monday night that Miss Lindsay\nlater said sin- would have resigned if the original motion had been\ncat tied.\n\u20221 Nakamlchl410pre-amp\u00a3150; 1 Lecson AP3 Power amp \u00a3 1 7 6 ; 1 Lec son APIX power amp \u00a3120.

He is a governor of a student\nresidence where a number of IC students reside.\n170 Picket\nA PICKET of Governing Bodv\nwas held outside 170 Queensgate, the Rector's residence, last\nFriday morning. About twenty\nstudents were present to hand out\nleaflets to College Governors before the meeting concerning\nSouth African students on the\nnuclear fuels technology course.\nStudents on the picket told\nFELIX that a member of the\nGoverning Body told the students\nthat there may well have been\nmore support for them amongst\nthe Governors than would have\nbeen shown on any voting. The issue of South African students on\nthe course is likely to come up\nagain at Board of Studies on May6, and a petition to be presented\nto the Board. ( A petition form\nwill be available Irom Kevin Courtney, Physics PG or the\nUnion Office.)\nSong Sung Blue\nBARNEY McCABE, ICU's multi talented Deputy President elect, had one of his songs,\nBrontosaurus Blues, performed in a musical evening in53 Princes\nGate last Friday. The song, a catchy unaccompanied S ATB* with male lead ditty, was well\nreceived, and Mr McCabe was\npleased with the World Premiere\nperformance. However, he did not mention any plans to go\nprofessional as a songwriter.\nBrontosaurus Blues will be published lor the first time in The\nPhoenix which will be on sale next\nterm.\n*Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass.\nMan v Machine\nON TUESDAY, March10, seven members of the Chess Club took on seven electronic opponents: NAS COM, Pets and the\nCollege main-frame.\nTwo of the computers, perhaps\nrather shy of their first public\nappearance didn't want to start;\nMMe Call's opponent, a rather\ntemperamental Nascom, twice\nsuffered from a nervous break-down during mid game. The computer on board 1 lost to a blindfolded player in twelve\nmoves, whilst the College CDC lost its queen and rook in 8.\n\" They' re crap!\" Captain of of\nthe magnificent seven commented after in lli c ting a crushing\n13:1 defeat on the computers.\nThe only person to lose was\nplaying blindfolded and was two\npieces up when he resigned out of\nboredom.\nWhen FELIX asked the Micro computing Club about this abysmal failure, the only replies\nreceived were \" well, mine didn't work\", \" ah come on!\" and \"just\nwait till next time\".\nFEUX, March 20,1981 Page 3\n\n"

I should point out that affiliation to WU S( World University Service) is not Ultra Vires,\nas it is an \"educational\" organisation, which is\nallowed under the law. Mr Passmore suggested at ICU Council that I had suggested\nthat affiliation to WU S was Ultra Vires; I admit\nthat connotation could be placed on what I wrote but all I intended was to liken the WU S collections at UG Ms to a possible collection\nfor affiliation fee that would otherwise be Ultra\nVires. It amazes me that Mr Passmore should\nread my editorial and only find that point worth\ncommenting on.
