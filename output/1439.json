Fortunately our own language has been blessed with more than\ntwenty words for 'rubbish', allowing\nme to correctly characterise that expression as being a mixture of garbage,\ntripe, balderdash, tommyrot, hogwash,\ngibberish, bunkum, claptrap and ba-loney, combined with liberal doses of\nflimflam, horsefeathers, twaddle, pop-pycock, bilge, hooey, bollocks, piffle,\ntrash, nonsense and drivel.\nThe real world frequently is so\nbreathtaking, so beautiful and so bizarre as to rival the most twisted im-agination, and the truth would make\nfor strange and compelling fiction. But\nthat is all. The platypus may be a curious and remarkable creature, but I\nwill bet you a lifetime's supply of insect\nrepellent that Gregor Samsa's metamorphosis into a cockroach is stranger\nstill. If Man can be rendered speechless\nat the sight of a lush English meadow\nafter a rainstorm, you might as well\nremove his larynx altogether if a white\nrabbit hops into view who knows how\nto read a pocket watch.\nBut on some rare occasions, when\nJupiter sees fit to rise in Capricorn\nand Taurus does unspeakable things to\nUranus, reality goes one better. To the\nsound of Ian Fleming and Alistair MacLean kicking themselves from beyond\nthe grave, the Telegraph published\na story earlier this week to rival any\npublished work of espionage or political intrigue. It seems that Mahmoud\nAhmadinejad, the well-known anti-Zionist, anti-Semite and antiquated\nautocrat may have been born Jewish.\nHow perfect. How impossibly, how\nincredibly, how unfathomably perfect.\nYou can almost picture the climactic\nscenes in the James Bond movie. Disguised as an Iranian nuclear scientist,\nRoger Moore is able to bluff his way\nthrough enough physics to penetrate\nthe heart of the country's secret underground reactor. Once inside, he\nsabotages the moderator and drives a\nfuel rod through the chief engineer's\nspine. As he races for the exit, Marjan\nal-Karakter, the beautiful UN diplomat\nand CIA double-agent, beckons to our\nhero from a side door. As he approach-es, the Revolutionary Guard surrounds\nhim and the sultry and treacherous\nMarjan leads her prisoner to the Presidential bunker.\nOur hero enters the August Presence with a quivering jowl and a barely\nperceptible raised eyebrow. He is faced\nwith the back of a revolving armchair,\nunderneath which two tiny feet swing\nhalf a metre in the air. A complicated\narray of controls lines the walls, and a\nvery simple array of guns points at his\nchest.\n\"Ah, Mr. Bond:\" oozes the voice from\nbehind the chair. \"How good of you to\njoin us. Your timing is impeccable. All\nthat remains for my plan to be complete is for that button to be pressed. A\nnuclear missile of unprecedented power and efficiency will come out of the\nground beneath our feet and soar into\nthe night sky. And soon, very soon, it\nwill land. And so the Zionist cancer\nwill be pushed into the sea, and the\nworld will once more be pure.\"\n\"So why do you need me?\" drawls our\nhero as the camera shows his hands\nreaching for his supersonic tiepin.\n\"I would love to press that button\nmyself, Mr Bond,\" says the tiny man\nas the chair begins to swivel. \"But you\nsee, it's Friday night, and my religion\nforbids me from activating machinery\non the Sabbath.\"\nThe news that the President of Iran\nmay be Jewish is sure to have widespread repercussions throughout the\nJewish world. If only because there is\nnow another handsome and powerful Jewish man who may be interested\nin a Jewish wife. And darlings, he's an\nengineer.\nIn the days since the Telegraph ran\nwith their story the Guardian has\ntaken it upon themselves to snuff out\none of the most promising and entertaining news stories of the year. For a\nshort while it was all too believable.\nAhmadinejad's reasons for claiming a\nglobal Zionist conspiracy would have\nbeen crystal clear: even his own country might be run by a Jew.\nOld Hand wrings his younger brother\n\u201cI was worried that\nFreshers\u2019 Week\nwas going to be my\nmost exciting week\nat university. How\nwrong I was.\u201d\nF\nuck me I\u2019m old.\nFor a while now, I have\ncome into College for 08:30,\nbuy my morning coffee \u2013 a\ndouble espresso \u2013 and croissant from the Junior Common\nRoom, go to my office and check my\nemails. I tend to leave all my College work at College, that includes all\nemails, which means the evenings are\nfree for relaxation, socialising with my\nhousemates and, of course, Fifa 09 on\nthe Playstation 3. I\u2019ll admit it now, I\u2019m\nnot very good at the old Fifa, Mario\nKart on the Wii is more my sort of\nthing, but the main reason I was never\ngood at Fifa was simply because my\nyoungest brother used to beat the crap\nout of me on that. That was eight years\nago when I was 16 and my little brother\nwas ten!\nThis last week, however, as I got off\nthe bus and made my way to College,\nI noticed that things were a little dif-ferent. For a start I have to queue in\nthe JCR for my coffee, the croissants\nseem to have all been eaten and all\nI\u2019m left with is a crappy, little, stale\npiece of Danish that no one wants to\neat because, let\u2019s face it, they taste like\n[qwerty]. Even on my way to the office things are different; the walk is no\nlonger a solo one, the silence replaced\nwith a mixture of voices from so many\nraces and backgrounds, and the corridors packed with eager eyed faces all\npreparing themselves for their first day\nat university. I look at these faces, and\nall I can see is my youngest brother, the\nsame young brother who dominated\nme on the Fifa field and regularly humiliated me with 5-0 and above beat-ings. That\u2019s when I realised; fuck me\nI\u2019m old!\nI spoke to my brother later that\nweek, mainly to see how things were\ngoing, but also to see how he was enjoying Freshers\u2019 Week. As expected, he\nreplied with one word. \u201cMessy,\u201d said\nmy brother down the phone, clearly\nsuffering with a hangover from the\nnight before. Not really a big surprise\nif you ask me.\n\u201cBut at least I don\u2019t have to go the\nall these introductory lectures, or lectures at all for that matter\u201d he said as\nsomeone was having a go at him on the\nother end for being so cocky. I laughed\nback and told him that it served him\nright. I asked how his mates were coping and if they were looking forward to\nthe year ahead. \u201cNo!\u201d was the reply I\ngot. Apparently, they were all worried\nthat Freshers\u2019 Week was the only bit\nof fun they were going to have all year\nas they were going to spend the rest of\nthe year working and not having a lot\nof time to relax.\nThinking back to my first week, I felt\nthe same. I was worried that Freshers\u2019\nWeek was going to be one of the most\nexciting weeks during my time at uni-versity, how wrong I was. Yes, Freshers\u2019 Week was fun (and boy do I have\na story for you guys about what happened to me at my Mingle \u2014 but we\u2019ll\nsave that for next week) but it was by\nno means the only fun week I had. The\nworkload was demanding, the hours\nwere long, we even had a Maths test in\nthe first week which didn\u2019t help, but I\nstill managed to find time to enjoy myself and get a good degree.\nAnd you can do it too. This is not\njust aimed at the freshers out there, the\nsame will apply to second, third and\neven fourth years. If you ever needed\nany proof, a very good friend of mine\nonly became the social animal that he\nis today in his third year. We dragged\nhim out with us, had fun, studied hard\nand he still came out with a 1st, and\nnot any sort of 1st, top of the year 1st.\nToday, he is in America doing a PhD.\nIt is possible, it can be done and it\nhas been done and you could do the\nsame. The proof, my dear readers, is in\nthe writing. So tune in next week and\nI\u2019ll tell you what we got up to at our\nFreshers\u2019 Mingle.\n\n"

Ha, now I\nhave your attention. It\u2019s\nall over the news, some\nmythical, do it all device\nthat\u2019s going to replace your computer,\nyour phone, your life. It\u2019s going to end\nworld hunger, make you super-human\nand might even get you laid.\nBollocks! You say? Well you\u2019d be spot\non. The thing is, it\u2019s all bollocks. At this\nstage no one knows anything. Seriously, it\u2019s all hearsay and rumour. Some\nmight be more legitimate than others,\nbut it\u2019s all still rumours. Yes, Foxconn\nmight make it (they\u2019re the chinese\ncompany who makes the iPhone, and\nthe one with the \u2018suicide\u2019 secracy pol-icy). And yes Apple probably has been\ntrying to make one since 2003, but\nmost good tech companies make inroads along all avenues of research and\ndevelopment at one stage or another.\nOtherwise they wouldn\u2019t be \u2018good\u2019 tech\ncompanies. So until Mr. Jobs pulls one\nout of his pocket and/or manialla enve-lope, don\u2019t believe everything you read.\nMore Apple news this week which\nshould be of interest to anyone thinking of getting an iPhone in the near fu-ture. O2 exclusivity deal for the iPhone\nin the UK will run out in the next couple of months. Both Orange, which is\nin the process of trying to merge with\nT-mobile to create the biggest UK net-work, and Vodaphone have already\nannounced availability of the iPhone\nfrom late 2009/early 2010. I say great\nnews as O2 totally rips iPhone users off\nwith crappy tarrifs and arguably poor\n3G service anywhere but London.\nOf course O2 still have their grubby\nmits on a Palm Pre exclusivity con-tract, so anyone seeking a bit of we-bOS are still stuck with the Telefonica\noff-shoot.\nSpotify brought their offline playlist\ncaching to the desktop this week following in the footsteps of their mobile\napps on Android and the iPhone. Unfortunately requiring a premium, \u00a39.99\nper month subscription, the desktop\nSpotify app now comes armed with a\nsimple offline switch. Spotify is certainly gunning for your hard-earned\nhere and a piece of the iTunes market\nshare. Personally I think they should\nenable the mobile apps and caching for\nthe free ad-supported accounts, but I\nguess you\u2019ve got to have some sort of\nincentive to go premium.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nWeekly Wrap Up - The Best of the rest in the world of technology\nT\nhis week has been an interesting week for Tech.\nFirst off on the big news,\nApple/Intel announced\nand demonstrated a new data transmission system the aptly named,\nLight Peak, which is capable of up\nto 10Gbps over an optical interconnect up to 100m in length. Managing\nto both smoothly drive a greater than\nHD res monitor and saturate a speedy\nSSD raid with a file transfer over one\nconnection, shows this could be a real\ncontender with USB 3.0, FireWire and\nDisplayPort.\nThe idea behind Light Peak is to reduce the number of connections and\nstandards you need on a single device\nand with that kind of bandwidth I can\nseriously see it replacing a lot of connections on your laptop, palmtop and\neven your desktop. Mind you looking\nat the hulking rig they used to demonstrate it, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see this\nin your iPhone/iPod any time soon, but\nrumours have it appearing in the Autumn 2010 Mac line.\nIn other news, the first ever writ\nvia Twitter was served by the British\nHigh Court this week. The injunction\nwas one against an anonymous Twitter user impersonating the right-wing\nblogger Donal Blaney, owner of Griffin\nLaw. This decision to employ Twitter\nas a legitimate service for serving the\ninjunction is interesting from many as-pects. The law tends to be a somewhat\nS\no, what\u2019s all this Waving business all about and\nshould you care?\nWell, Wave is Google\u2019s new\ncommunication project that is somewhat difficult to describe, but is based\naround an amalgamation of IM, email\nand real-time collaboration services.\nIt\u2019s currently in a closed beta, recently\nexpanded to 100,000 testers (all invited manually if we\u2019re to believe the\nbuzz) and may revolutionise the way\nwe communicate with our friends, coworkers and family across the internet.\nI\u2019ve got MSN/Yahoo/AOL/Gtalk IM\nalready, and email, why would I want\nsomething else? Well, imagine a we-bapp that you can login to from anywhere with a browser, that gave you\ncollaborative blend of IM and email\nwith a load of sharing features all in a\ntidy and unique package. That\u2019s what\nGoogle\u2019s aim is for Wave. It\u2019s something that you\u2019ll have to see to really\nunderstand but one of its stand out\nfeatures is the instant character broad-cast. That is, the text you type instantly\nappears in the Wave for everyone to see\nthe moment your finger hits the key.\nNow in my mind this will lead to a load\nof typos, but if we gloss over that, we\ncould have collaborative conversations\nwhere you can interpret what people\nare saying, edit it in real-time and even\nfinish their sentences for them. Replies\ncan be started in a separate message,\nbut you can also reply to someone\u2019s\nsentence right in that sentence meaning you no longer have any ambiguity\nto who or what you might be replying\nto. The Wave also represents a persistent message a bit like email, meaning\nyou can invite people or send them the\nWave at a later date. They\u2019ll get all the\nconversation and edits and be able to\nplay it back blow by blow with the replay feature. Say you\u2019ve got a conversation about a busted piece of equipment\nbetween two colleagues. They can talk\nit all out with costs and alternatives in\na Wave, once they\u2019ve come to a conclusion of how to proceed, they can then\nsend the whole Wave to their boss. He\ncan see all the information but doesn\u2019t\nneed to haggle over the details to sign\noff on it. It\u2019ll be a lot cleaner and much\nmore efficient than sending a chain of\nemails, especially if more than one or\ntwo people are replying, something\nthat makes a complete mess of emails.\nWaves are more than collaborative\nIM sessions though. You can directly\nembed media in them via simple drag\nand drop. Photos, YouTube videos and\nGoogle Docs can all be directly embedded within the Wave for watching,\nediting, reading or viewing. Examples\ngiven by Google for real world use of\nWave could be checking of a contract,\nreviewing the document and pulling\nbits of text out into Waves for collaborative editing. Now I can see myself editing journal articles and joint project\nwrite-ups like this, so for students it\ncould be incredibly useful for all the\ngroup projects everyone seems to have\nto go through.\nAnother stand out feature that might\nbe incredibly useful, if it works as de-scribed, are the use of Wave extensions,\none of which was real-time (can you\nsee a trend here?) translation. Imagine\ntalking to a friend in Brazil in Portuguese, just by typing in English. Now\nI must admit that machine translation\nhas never been particularly accurate,\nbut it should be sufficient for your\nfriend to work out what you\u2019re say-ing. Language barrier be damned, we\nwill converse about that sick YouTube\nvideo, even if we don\u2019t speak the same\nlanguage.\nThe beauty of Google Wave however\nhas to be in the code, and forgive me\nif this is boring to some of you, but it\u2019s\nmostly written in HTML5. This means\nthat without any major effort, it should\nwork on any up-to-date browser on any\nplatform on any device with feature\nparity. The obvious implementation is\nmobile platforms. Google is right on\nthis and as of the developer preview, a\nworking iPhone webapp complete with\npretty home screen icon was working,\nwith one exception editing. It\u2019s something that\u2019s not supported directly in\nHTML5 but is also something that\ncould change by the time the webapp\nhits the wider world.\nSo will Wave succeed? I find it hard\nto believe it won\u2019t afterall it is Google.\nWill it be useful? Undoubtedly it will\nbe useful, especially for anyone who\nwants to collaboratively edit some-thing, so for students I think it could\nsimply genius. Will it replace everything else? No, and I think that\u2019s where\nthe hype out-reaches the possibility for\nthe product. With a load of social networking sites, IM networks and good\nold email pretty entrenched, Google\nWave is not going to roll in and wash\nall else out. Should you be excited?\nWell I\u2019m intrigued and I think you\nshould check it out as soon as you can,\nwhich may not be for a good while, but\nit\u2019s not going to be earth shattering\nwhen it lands.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nslow and behind the times force which\nhas shown unexpected forward think-ing. It also means that a precedent has\nbeen set for both serving writs across\nthe service and also the targeting of\nanonymous abuse across the internet.\nAs the film industry and now both\nSky and Sony among others all push\ntowards 3D TV, Sony made a significant announcement of a single lens\n3D video camera. Up until now, all\n3D recording was essentially done by\nbolting two lenses with two sensors to-gether. This meant that the camera is\nboth bulky and not suited for any fast\nmoving recording such as sport.\nSony have shoved two CMOS sensors behind one lens with the light\nsplit by a system of mirrors.

Have I missed first lecture\nagain?\u201d This is followed by enjoying a light liquid relief of tea, whilst\nstaring into the familiar grey sky and\nbasking in the knowledge summer\nbrings, ignoring the lack of money, but\nhaving the freedom to do anything,\nwhenever, wherever.\nHowever, one critical barrier to this\nfreedom is the weather....the British live\nthrough it. Much like the war effort, it\nunifies people; we all know the experience and usually can find a whole conversation worth of complaints, which\nsomehow makes it more bearable. I\ncome from the south west, specifically Bristol. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\nlove Bristol and am grateful that I grew\nup there, I even rejoice in my slightly\ntwangy regional accent but (and it is a\nbig British BUT), since moving away to\nthe distinctly sunnier/drier south east,\nI can make one observation; the south\nwest is WET. My childhood memories are full of camping/sailing trips\nin Devon, Cornwall and South Wales,\nall set against the back drop of grey,\nendless weeks of drizzle and relentless rain drops. This is then followed\nby a feeling of almost disrespect for\nmy parents. WHY would you actually\nchoose to live and holiday in a place\nso notoriously damp? On asking my\nparents this, a simple apathetic shoulder shrug and a look of hurt ensues.\nYou might think I am exaggerating.\nPerhaps I am, but the South West peninsula is prone to very heavy rainfall\nlasting from about 5 to 15 hours. The\nfamous downfall of 200mm devastated Boscastle, Cornwall on 16 August\n2004 and is one of the many freakishly\ntypical summer showers, which happened to also be the week of the annual\nfamily camping trip.\nMaybe I should be more grateful for\nthose holidays, after all there is also a\ngreat deal of hope when launching off\ninto a holiday in the South West, not\ndissimilar to the rush of gambling at\na casino or betting on the under-dog,\npartly because it does have some winning potential. If through sheer luck,\nyou happen to holiday in a week of\ntotally amazing weather, you will be\nable to longue on beautifully serene,\ncliff encased beaches and with a bit of\nblurry cider fuel, enjoy the night life of\nthe infamous Newquay, enhanced by\nthe rush of implausibility. I have experienced this rush once, when on holiday in Devon with friends, when we\nreceived 3 whole blissful days of sun,\nBBQ\u2019s on the beach, skinny dipping\nand the rest! The return of the rain\nbrought a couple of kooked up nights\nin \u00a310 Tesco tents before breaking into\na conveniently absent friend\u2019s caravan\nfor shelter. I look back on those times\nfondly and it reminds me that despite\nrain, summer is summer and even\nwithout sun there are still times to be\nhad. In fact, the optimist in me says,\nthat the British weather actually adds\nto a holiday when in the right company\nand becomes a kind of running joke.\nOf course the obvious example of\nthis \u201cjoke\u201d is the atmosphere at an\noften wet Glastonbury, which demonstrates the mass embrace for mud,\nwellies and Macs.... it just adds to the\nexperience. A clich\u00e9, but a true one, so\nfor those who have never been on an\noutdoor British summer experience, I\nurge you to take a gamble.\nThe next time you have a free week in\nthe spring/summer and feeling particularly resilient, pack up a sturdy tent,\nwaterproofs and some baked beans\nand head for the turbulent southwest.\nAt the very least it should help you to\nrealise an appreciation for the location\nof Imperial.\nKatie Tomlinson questions her parents\n\u201cMuch like the war\neffort, the British\nweather unifies\npeople; we all know\nthe experience\nand will happily\ncomplain about it\u201d\nT\nhe memory was somewhat\nhazy. I remember the cheesecake we brought upstairs,\nthe drunken chat (me being\ndrunk, she sober) \u2012 and somehow I\nended in her car, confessing my affection for her. Then, further obscured by\nthe effects of intoxicants, my recollection says things got intimate.\nHere\u2019s the bummer. For a relationship that accelerated at this rate \u2014 I\nhad only seen her three times before\nthe occasion \u2014 it would have been\nsuch a heavenly pairing, that would\nseem too good to be true. Well, this\ncertain scenario took place towards\nthe epilogue of my farewell party, since\ntwo days later I was bound on a flight\nto London from the Land of the Long\nWhite Cloud.\nThat\u2019s right. I fell in love with a girl in\nNew Zealand.\nWhich nicely typifies summer romances \u2012 they happen in the most\nunlikely of places, and they never\nlast long. They serve as heart-felt lessons in the field and, be it Romeo-ite\nor Casanovan, deeply influences your\nperception of love. They are unfor-gettable, enduringly bittersweet, and,\nparticularly in my position, immensely\nmissed.\nAnd it is from this new-found long-ing, and experience, that I\u2019ve had my\nrevelation.\nI used to firmly believe in the notorious male-to-female ratio, surrounded\nby fellow believers, and blame much\nof my failures on it. How foolish was I,\nwith hindsight, to base my \u2018chances\u2019 on\nstatistics and figures that hardly represent the fact.\nSo allow me to urge you, ladies and\nespecially gentlemen, to venture out\nof the endearing pessimism. For the\nFreshers \u2012 being one myself only three\nmonths ago \u2012 clinging on to the only\nfamiliar setting that is Imperial College in unfamiliarity is absolutely fair\nenough. But once acquaintances became old, and routines repetitive, isn\u2019t\nit time to try something new?\nAnd to emphasise my point, I\u2019ll play\nthe hypocrite and cite the golden rule\nof relationships-past: move on.\nAll in all, do not put too much faith\nin the faux safety of your comfort zone,\nlet alone dwell in it. In our case, fellow\nmembers of our celebrated institute,\ntry not to confine your sex life to within the boundaries of Imperial.\nAnd guys, if you\u2019ve yet again condemned Imperial\u2019s most clich\u00e9d ratio\nfor falling short of that hot chick, go\nstraighten up your dick and try hard-er. If the sixty-seven-to-thirty-three\nblame game (and/or Warcraft) is the\nonly game you play, then I\u2019m afraid homosexuality is your only other option\nfor inter-human sexual enlightenment.\nPeople say that university is not all\nabout academic achievements. Bear\nthat in mind when you engage in societies you\u2019ve found at Freshers\u2019 Fair,\nor continue pursuing your previous\ninterests. You will come to appreciate\nthe benefits brought by the social opportunities not only from inside the\nuniversity, but outside of it.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for my hitchhiking stunt\nfrom London to Morocco, I wouldn\u2019t\nhave discovered a lifelong friendship in\nmy hitch partner, who goes to Queen\nMary. If it wasn\u2019t for fencing, which I\npicked up last year at Freshers\u2019 Fair, I\nwouldn\u2019t have met a horde of ridiculously gracious Kiwis and befriended\nthem, with one of which I have further\ndeveloped something I could only describe as magical.\nI appreciate that, being an Imperial\nstudent, we are less inclined to include\nany more activities in our busy lives\nother than the odd sporting commit-ment, frequent pilgrimage to the library and generally drinking ourselves\ninto liver failure. But if we look around,\nwith a bit of time management skills,\nthere are numerous opportunities for\ndiscovery, each potentially taking us\ninto the real world where zero bollocks\nratios \u2018define\u2019 our love lives.\nSo do have faith, and for heaven\u2019s\nsake do do something. That\u2019s because,\njust like summer romances, you cannot find it around the corner when you\nhaven\u2019t even bothered taking the turn.\nMeanwhile I\u2019m spending way too\nmuch time gazing into the snapshot.\nShe was by my side, my arms wrapped\naround her shoulders; she was smiling to the camera. I will keep reminding myself how much I love her still,\nand lamenting on the opportunity we\nare never blessed with to take things\nfurther.\nAt least for now.\nDisclaimer: The picture above is not\nof Dylan Lowe and his partner.\nDylan Lowe falls in love with a Kiwi\n\u201cAnd guys, if you\u2019ve\ncondemned Imperial\u2019s clich\u00e9d\nmale:female ratio,\ngo straighten up\nyour dick and try\nharder.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "17\nfelix FRIDAY 09 OCTOBER 2009\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk POLITICS\nSurveillance Society\nIn 1994, the paper CCTV: Looking out\nfor you by the Home Office under Conservative Prime Minister John Major\nwas published. Mr. Major was not terribly concerned: \u201cI have no doubt we\nwill hear some protest about a threat\nto civil liberties. Well, I have no sympathy whatsoever for so-called liberties of that kind.\u201d It is understood that\nMr. Major held the view \u2018if you have\nnothing to hide, you have nothing to\nfear\u2019 giving the Conservatives the carte\nblanche to blitzkrieg the private lives of\nordinary citizens. There is one CCTV\ncamera for every fourteenth person\nand it does certainly act as a deterrent\nin some places, but while CCTV is a\nvaluable tool for investigating crime,\nfootage rarely secures a conviction\non its own e.g. only 8% of incidents\ncaught on camera in Midlothian led to\narrest. Over the past four years Scotland alone has spent \u00a342 million on\nCCTV cameras. For the same money\n350 full-time police officers could have\nbeen hired. A report, written by Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville, who\nruns the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Visual\nImages Identifications and Detections\nOffice, found that for every 1,000 cameras in London, less than one crime is\nsolved per year.\nThe revelation that the UK National\nDNA Database (NDNAD) is the largest in the world should come as no\nsurprise. The NDNAD traces its roots\nback to 1994 when the Criminal Justice\nand Public Order Act (CJPOA) was\npassed in Parliament. The police could\nnow take samples by force if neces-sary. The CJPOA gave the police powers to search the database for matches\nbetween DNA profiles. If a person was\nsubsequently found guilty, their information and samples could be stored\non the database indefinitely. However,\nif the suspect was not charged or was\nacquitted the DNA samples had to be\ndestroyed. The Criminal Justice and\nPolice Act enabled the NDNAD to retain samples indefinitely taken from\nconsenting volunteers participating in\nmass screenings. The Criminal Justice\nAct allowed DNA profiles, fingerprints\nand \u201cother\u201d information to be taken\nwithout consent from anyone arrested\non suspicion of any recordable offence.\nPolice can keep this information in-definitely, even if the person arrested is\nnever charged. The Counter-Terrorism\nAct (CTA) extended police powers to\nallow DNA and fingerprints to be\ntaken from people subject to control\norders. The samples were to be used\nonly \u201cin the interest of national security.\u201d The latter amendments were all\ndone in the name of the War on Terror,\nthough who exactly the terrorists are\nremains open for interpretation. Naturally though, it has all gone sensationally wrong. In 2008 the Home Office\nrevealed that 2,324,879 recorded crim-inals, or 40%, in England and Wales did\nnot have their DNA sample stored on\nthe NDNAD. In addition, 857,366 innocent individuals\u2019 profiles were currently held on the NDNAD.\nThe government grants itself the\nright, through the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), to access a\nperson\u2019s electronic communications in\na highly unrestricted manner, infringing on the privacy of their correspondence in the name of national security.\nIn 2003, several addendums were added to the bill, the intelligence service\ncan now also collect data from job centres and local councils. Initially nine\norganisations could invoke the RIPA\nbut today 792 government organisations are allowed to appeal to the act.\n474 councils now have the same power\nas MI5 with regards to RIPA.\nDorset council put a family under surveillance to check that they lived in the\nschool catchment area. The same council put local fishermen under surveillance looking for illegal fishing. An investigation by the Guardian showed that\nseveral thousand of these kinds of petty\nmisdemeanours are being targeted as\nthreats to national security every month.\nNearly 60 new powers contained in\nmore than 25 Acts of Parliament have\nstymied our freedoms and broken\npledges set out in the Magna Carta\nand Bill of Rights, thanks to New Labour and the other parties. Whilst our\npolitical parties are doing a formidable\njob in eating away our freedom, there\nis also another player on the stage,\nnamely the EU. The EU Data Retention\nDirective aims to harmonise member states\u2019 provisions relating to the\nretention of communications data.\nThe caller, the time and the means of\ncommunication are available for the\npurpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime\nand terrorism. Telecommunications\ncompanies have to store this information for at least six months. We make\nhundreds of calls each year the details\nof which, not contents, are stored. The\ndirective also covers Internet access,\nemail and Internet telephony.\n42 human rights and civil liberties\norganisations banded together to oppose the directive in the European\nCourt of Justice where they lost.\nBrussels thus imposed a highly unpopular law which would damage the\npeople, the industry and not in the\nleast, the credibility of themselves. Effectively this leaves the security services cherry picking as to which law they\nshall use to violate our fundamental\nhuman right to privacy. The European\nParliament is particularly keen to strike\ndown bloggers with \u201cmalicious intent\u201d\nor a \u201chidden agenda\u201d, which cannot apply to their own staff since they are not\neven bloggers but promoters of an official organization that, most definitely,\nhas an agenda, though hidden it is not.\nThe EU for example spent \u20ac1.8 million on propaganda in Ireland to force\nthem, in their second referendum on\nthe same question, to ratify the Lisbon Treaty. After the first rejection, a\nleaked document from the European\nCommission read \u201cthe internet has\nallowed increased communication\nbetween citizen groups away from\nGovernment and traditional media\ndominated sources.\u201d The report went\non to say \u201cbecause of the many different sources of No campaigners on the\ninternet, classic rebuttals is made impossible.\u201d Thus, the \u2018No\u2019 campaigners\nare the bad guys for using the blogosphere as the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaigners cannot\ninstigate an effective counter offensive\nwhere they do not control the battle\nfield. In 2008 alone, the EU spent more\nthan \u20ac2.4 billion on propaganda or advertisement of the EU, which is more\nthan Coca Cola\u2019s entire global advertising budget.\nThis is the Britain New Labour, the\nConservatives and the EU created. A\nrealm where freedom of speech is delivered a blow day after day, where democracy and liberty are shackled, tortured and are screaming in their closed\nconfinements that once was the birth\nof a proud democracy, the Palace of\nWestminster. The indifference shown\nby this country in the face of the previous and current government\u2019s war\non basic human rights has clearly displayed the true spirit of a people that\nhas forgotten its history and \u201cA nation\nwhich forgets its past has no future\u201d \u2013\nSir Winston S. Churchill. If we do not\ncare about our civil liberties then we do\nnot deserve our freedom.\nNeil Dhir\nNeil Dhir\nThe visible face of the conspiracy against civil liberty in the United Kingdom\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Raphael Houdmont\nThe Central American country of Honduras has had a turbulent\nsummer.\nIn the morning of June 28th, following an arrest warrant issued by the\nSupreme Court, soldiers from the Honduran military stormed President\nManuel Zelaya\u2019s residence in Tegucigalpa, the capital, overcame ten presidential guards, bundled Mr. Zelaya (pictured) into his private jet while he\nwas still in his pyjamas, and sent him into exile in Costa Rica.\nMembers of the Supreme Court and Roberto Micheletti, the Speaker of\nCongress, had deemed Zelaya\u2019s recent attempt at constitutional reform un-constitutional. Zelaya, a supporter of Hugo Chavez\u2019s socialism, was supposedly seeking to run for a third consecutive term as president.\nInternational reaction to the military coup has been almost universally\nnegative, and no foreign government has yet recognized the Interim Government led by Mr. Micheletti. Since the coup, Zelaya has made several attempts\nto return to power, unsuccessfully trying to land his plane at Tegucigalpa\u2019s\nairport on July 5th, and crossing the border from Nicaragua into Honduras on July 26th, before being forced to turn back by Honduran soldiers.\nOn September 21st, he reappeared in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa,\nprompting a curfew throughout the city, and bringing much of the country\nto a standstill until earlier this week.\nHonduras\nOn October 1st 1949, Mao Zedong stood before the Gate of Heavenly\nPeace, facing Tiananmen Square, and declared the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nOn the same day this year, China held huge displays of military might to\ncelebrate the National Day. 10,000 goose-stepping soldiers marched down\nChang\u2019an Avenue, followed by an impressive array of 500 tanks, the latest in\nintercontinental ballistic missile technology, over 150 military aircraft, and\n100,000 civilian participants.\nThe parade, which stretched over three kilometers, was perfectly choreographed during four months of training. Soldiers were told to blink only once\nevery forty seconds, and took precisely 116 steps per minute. All of the communist party\u2019s senior members attended, including Chairman Hu Jintao and\nPremier Wen Jiabao.\nThe lavish ceremony was a reminder to the country, and the world, of\nChina\u2019s growing military, political and economic clout. Despite these significant gains, China\u2019s leaders still complain that the world has not accepted its\nemergence. Developed countries argue in turn that China has yet to demonstrate that it will accept the responsibility which naturally comes with greater\npower.\nChina\nThe discovery of a second uranium-enrichment plant near the city of\nQom in Iran has prompted outrage from international observers, but\nensuing talks may turn out to be fruitful, for once.\nThe plant, which can be used for making weapons-usable uranium, suggests that Iran, which is also working to produce plutonium, another bomb\ningredient, is getting threateningly close to being able to build nuclear weap-ons. Although its leaders stress that all nuclear activity is for civilian purposes only, few outsiders believe their claim.\nIn response to the threat, talks have been held in Geneva between Iran\nand six countries \u2013 the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and\nChina. These talks also open the first formal, direct negotiations between\nIran and the US in three decades. Similar attempts at making Iran relinquish\nits nuclear ambitions have failed because of a lack of support from Russia\nand China.\nThis time however, Iran has agreed, in principal, to export much of its\nstock of uranium for processing, and to reveal its new plant to UN inspectors\nwithin a fortnight. Western officials caution that these agreements could still\nunravel during negotiations over details, but the deals offer the hope that the\nnuclear crisis could be diffused, at least temporarily.\nIran\n\n"

How does theory become fact?\nThese are all very worthwhile ques-tions, but are they useful? Do they even\nhave answers? Philosophy of science is\nconcerned with the assumptions, foundations and implications of science,\nfrom problems of proof to other ethical\nproblems.\nEvery student at Imperial College\nuses and applies \u2018science\u2019 everyday,\nwhether that be in a lab, lecture or\nworkshop, working with a set of principles which are set in stone. These\nprinciples guide us through problem\nsheets, projects and experiments, and\nin general our degrees would be bloody\ndifficult without them. One aspect of\nthe philosophy deals directly with this\nissue, it deals with the fundamentals\nof science, the very building blocks on\nwhich science is based.\nFrom Newton\u2019s Laws to the survival\nof the fittest, these principles are the\nbare bones of science. But, one thing\nthat annoys me bitterly is when people\ncompare science to a religion, saying\nthat it is founded on a set of \u2018beliefs\u2019,\nand these \u2018beliefs\u2019 are no more conclusive than any other theory. This\nstarted me thinking, how could I prove\nthat what we are studying is solid,\nindisputable and unequivocal fact?\nHowever, before I start sounding too\nmuch like Richard Dawkins, I would\nlike to say that science, by definition,\nis responsible for the fundamentals of\nthe universe. But why? These \u2018beliefs\u2019\ntranslate into the laws, methods and\npredictions by which science and scientists obey. Newton\u2019s laws are known\nto be laws because of the fact that they\nare universal, but we cannot test each\nand every case in which they apply\nto truly test that they are universal. It\nwould be a complete waste of time. We\nexpect the sun to rise every morning\nand it does without fail, but there is absolutely no way we can be totally sure\nthat tomorrow it won\u2019t. People don\u2019t\npanic every night about the possibility\nof no sun the next day. Human intuition leads us to believe that Newton\u2019s\nlaws are universal and that the sun will\nrise tomorrow, because we have never\nexperienced a situation where they\nhaven\u2019t occurred, and it\u2019s our nature to\nexpect what has come before.\nI am not trying to convince you here\nthat you should abandon all hope and\ntrust in science and run away in the\nopposite direction, more questioning\nthe fact that should we be questioning\nthe science that we are being taught\nhere? Could one complete an entire\ndegree and then turn around and\nask how, what and why you studied\nthis subject. Would asking questions,\nwhich could shake the foundations of\nscience, be worth the effort? An analogous situation to this is a child asking\nthe question \u2018why\u2019 repeatedly, everyone\u2019s done it, and will have it done too\nthem. It is annoying, but hark back to\nyour childhood and you\u2019ll realise that\nthe reason that you did it was simply because you were curious about\nyour surroundings. Why do light\nbulbs work? Electricity, why? Heats\nup the metal inside.......why? etc, and\nthe conversation would end up with\na stern \u2018because I said so\u2019 from your\nparents. Why not try this technique\nwith lectures, see what happens when\nyou ask them for conclusive proof that\nthe sun will rise tomorrow or that E\nalways, without a shadow of a doubt,\nequals mc2.\nDo we really have to bore ourselves\nPhilosophy of Science: a help or hindrance?\nRichardHoward\nRichardHoward Science Reporter\nA mental workout in all respects - enter the Brain Gym\nThis is exactly where I have been going wrong all these years. So many\nlectures I have spent trying as hard\nas possible to concentrate on the delights displayed before me, only to\nbe greeted by an unavoidable wall of\nsleep hitting within first ten minutes.\nBut now a technique has come to light,\nsomething so extraordinary and unu-sual, it must work. Children\u2019s concentration spans are being improved up\nand down the country thanks to an increasingly popular \u2018movement-based\u2019\nprogramme known as the \u2018Brain Gym.\u2019\nAccording to the official website for\n\u2018Educational Kinesiology and Brain\nGym\u2019 this revolutionary technique has\nbeen practiced for 27 years and is used\nin over 80 countries worldwide. Many\nschools teach its methods on a daily\nbasis and the reported results are often\nof a profound increase in concentra-tion, calmness and learning ability.\nMy problem with this? Don\u2019t think\nfor one minute I opposed to teachers using any creative method they\ncan think up in a moment of panic\nto restore discipline to a room full of\n25-odd school children. My issue lies\nwith the way in which Brain Gym is\npresented to be a science. An actual\nmethod where the processed involved\nare directly and unquestionably linked\nto the results achieved.\nSome of what the Brain Gym curriculum teaches is common sense and\nBrigetteAtkins\nBrigetteAtkins Science Editor sound advice. For example, it advises\npupils drink water often throughout\nthe day to hydrate the body and allow\nfor better concentration. This is fair\nenough; a person is likely to be less\nattentive if they are dehydrated. Unfortunately the Brain Gym Teachers\nEdition does then go on to say \u2018processed foods do not contain water\u2019 and\nfoods such as soup are \u2018processed in\nthe body as food\u2019 and \u2018[do] not serve\nthe body\u2019s water needs\u2019. Aside from\nthis obsession about water, there are\nother methods to engage your mind\nin preparation for learning. Most are\nmore than a little obscure and several\nare actually quite tricky to coordi-nate, involving twisting your fingers\ninto complicated knots to connect\nthe pathways in your brain. In the\nbox are some of the more popular\nBrain Gym exercises. You may like to\ntry them out in lectures for your own\namusement.\nWhile these routines are pretty\nlaughable in themselves, the fact that it\nis being taught as a \u2018science\u2019 to young\nchildren is worrying. What Brain\nGym actually is a pseudoscience, littered technical terms and packed with\noceans of irrelevant or incorrect \u2018science\u2019 to market a supposedly proven-to-work product at an unknowing\nmass \u2013 in this case children. It is also,\nfor teachers, a quick and seemingly\ncheap cure-all to manage a lesson in an\nage where every child seems come with\na behavioural disability label attached\nand tougher child protection legisla-tions make controlling a classroom increasingly difficult.\nBrain Gym is not an entirely new\nconcept, the teachers\u2019 handbook from\n1989 is still in use, but with over 1700\nteachers recently trained in its methods by the one body, Osiris, at around\n\u00a33000 per head, Brain Gym is fast becoming big business.\nThe trouble is, it probably works. We\nare all affected by the placebo effect\nto varying degrees and teacher or pupil expectation of such a programme\nwill have an enormous influence on\nresults in the classroom. However\ndressing up what is, in all honesty, a\nway to get children to burn off some\nenergy and settle down as factual science is completely misleading and\nincorrect. As Ben Goldacre quoted in\nthe Guardian\u2019s \u2018Bad Science\u2019 column;\n\u2018In an ideal world, we would be teaching children enough science in school\nthat they were able to stand up to a\nteacher who was spouting this kind of\nrubbish.\u2019\nBrain Gym basics:\nBrain Buttons - this will (apparently) increase blood flow to your\nbrain and help \u2018switch [the brain] on\u2019 before a lesson: make as large\na \u2018C\u2019 as you can with your forefinger and thumb. Place this below\nyour collar bone on each side of your sternum. Press lightly in a pulsing manner. At the same time, pulse your navel area with your other\nhand for around two minutes.\nCross Crawl \u2013 helps information pass between the left and right\nhemispheres of the brain. Essential for language skills. Can be done\nstanding or sitting (I would recommend the latter mid-lecture): with\na marching motion, put your left hand on your right knee as you\nbring it up. Change hands for your left knee as you raise it. Again,\ntwo minutes should do the trick.\nHook-Ups \u2013 despite a promising title, this appears to be one of the\nmore complicated routines. For calming nerves simply: standing or\nsitting, cross your right ankle over your left. Do the same with your\nwrists but link your fingers keeping your right hand on top. Bend out\nyour elbows and turn the fingers towards your body until they rest\non your sternum. Stay like this for several minutes.\nHold it, this guy needs calm and a\ntime to reflect right now\n\u201cI am not trying to\nconvince you here\nthat you should\nabandon all hope\nand trust in science\nand run away\nin the opposite\ndirection...\u201d\nwith all this rubbish, shouldn\u2019t we let\nscience go about its daily business.\nNothing so far, of this kind, has sunk\nthe great ship science and hopefully\nwill never. But the thing that grinds\nmy gears is the fact that the essence of\nscience is to deal with these obscure\nhang ups, and clear the room of these\nenigmatic spiders\u2019 webs. This philosophical problem is like a bad rash, if\nyou ignore it, it might go away. However, it is more likely that it\u2019ll stay, and\nwhat is much more of a pain is that\nthere are no clear cut ways of dealing\nwith them.\nIn gaining knowledge on how the\nfundamentals of science are proven to\nbe fundamental, in themselves, would\nwe be better off as a student of science\nand related subjects? Would be able to\nappreciate the detail, intricacies and,\ndare I say, beauty of science more?\nPhilosophy of science has a go at\nshedding light on this particular prob-lem, so should we be taught it in our\nmainstream courses?\n\n"

    "content": "unionpage\nOn Tuesday 6 October College was\ntransformed for the day to become a\nbustling bazaar of stalls from all of our\nClubs & Societies, as well as many external\ncompanies making it the single biggest\nday for Clubs & Societies at Imperial: a\ncelebration of everything extracurricular in\namongst an otherwise hectic week getting\nto grips with academics. By the looks of\nthe turnout it also seems to have been our\nmost successful ever!\nIt wasn\u2019t all smooth running though. In\ninitial plans many clubs were all prepared\nfor a stall in the gentle early autumn\nsunshine, but as the day approached the\nMet Office had a different story to tell and\nso on Monday it was all change. It was a\nquick turnaround to the contingency Wet\nWeather Plan as some heavy rain was on\nthe cards. Overall however, those clubs\nwho had to move dealt with it admirably\nmaking for an enjoyable day to be had by all\nand the mood proving impermeable to the\noutside dampness.\nWhat was also apparent is that this year we\nseem to have some very hardy Freshers\nwith an estimated 7000 punters coming to\ncampus to see what stalls could take their\nfancy, signing up to mailing lists and getting\na-hold of some freebies. Last year we had\nover 50% of students getting involved in at\nleast one Club or Society and if Freshers\u2019\nFair was anything to go by, we\u2019ll hopefully\ntop that, maintaining our position as the\nUniversity with the greatest extracurricular\nparticipation the UK!\nAcross the entire campus there was\ncertainly a buzz. The SAF contained the\nmajority of ICSMSU clubs. The nearby\nQueen\u2019s Lawn Campus Car Park was the\nhome of an eclectic group of vehicles,\nincluding Jezebel, the RCSU\u2019s mascot 1916\nDennis Fire Engine that was taking tours\naround the local area on the day.\nThe Tower Rooms featured our music and\narts groups which made for an acoustic\nfeast when you could hear the offerings\nabove the crowds which filled the room to\nmaximum capacity at some points of the\nday.\nThe Great Hall brought new meaning to\nthe saying \u2018it\u2019s a small world\u2019 as it was\nfilled with all of our International societies.\nWe get told many times that Imperial has\na rich diversity of cultures represented at\nthe College, but to look at that room was\nto properly understand what is meant by\n\u2018International\u2019.\nThe JCR was one of the areas which was\nimpacted by the Wet Weather Plan, all of a\nsudden welcoming in many of the clubs of\nthe City & Guild\u2019s College Union in addition\nto those that were already there many for\nan exciting mix.\nThe Business School Foyer, despite being a\nbit out of the way of many of the areas still\nsaw much attention for the Sports Clubs\ntherein. From the grapevine, it sounds like\nthere were several sign ups from Freshers\nand returning students alike thinking about\nhow they were going to stay active this\nyear, which also sounds it might be a\npromising year for our Sports Teams.\nStill more activity could be seen in Beit\nQuad which was initially intended to be the\nhome of the Outdoor based societies who\nregularly get out and about to enjoy some\nof Britain\u2019s country side. They soon had\nto welcome in yet more sports clubs as\nwell as some politics too! All of our Union\nMedia clubs (such as this fine publication)\ncould also be found there. On top of this\nthere was a stage with live performances\nfrom many clubs with external guests, Her\nMajesty\u2019s Coldstream Guards making a\nparticularly special appearance during day\nin association with Wind Band, but many\nthanks go to all those clubs who gave up\ntheir time to practice and perform on the\nday.\nBecause of the wet weather, the Union\nBuilding itself became a hub of activity with\nclubs spread across 3 rooms. Represented\nhere were our Faith societies, Martial Arts\nand the Departmental societies of the\nRCSU and RSM. Our financially minded\nclubs were also based here and soldiered\non, so if you couldn\u2019t find them on the\nday- its not to late to get in touch with them\nnow!\nThe day didn\u2019t stop at 4pm though, as\neveryone was invited over to the Union for\nthe Freshers\u2019 Fair After party which went\non until 11. At the party there was still more\nlive entertainment from clubs with Music\nTech finishing up the evening in style. Many\nthanks go to Tosin Ajayi who compered\nboth during the day and evening. Awards\nwere also given out to clubs in each area\nwith the most innovative stalls from the\nday. These went to PASS, Geophysics\nSoc, Ultimate Frisbee, Engineers Without\nBoarders, Polish Society and Snow Sports\nwith the overall winner being Balloon\nTwisting society so many congratulations to\nall of them.\nOverall I hope that everyone who was there\non the day had a great time. For those of\nyou browsing, I hope you found at least\none club who shares your interests or\nsomething that you want to try out this year.\nFor all who helped out with a stall thank\nyou for giving up even more of your time\nto promote all the things you and your club\ndo- its thanks to your efforts that we\u2019re able\nto boast about all of our Clubs & Societies.\nFinally it\u2019s only left to thank everyone else\nwho helped out in the background, in\nparticular those who were there from 7am\nto help set everything up. Here\u2019s to another\ngreat year ahead for Clubs & Societies.\nFreshers\u2019 Fair 2009\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nJennyWilson\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies) dpcs@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

But more on that\n\u2018sports entertainment\u2019 show later.\nControversy.

Just a\nselection that instantly pop into mind.\nI admit I am not a die-hard F1 fan,\nso I shan\u2019t go into detail in any of these\ncases, however I do hope I show some\ncolour into the soiled image of this\nonce well-respected sport.\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment\n(WWE) is a sports entertainment company specialising in acting professional\nwrestling. It is privately controlled by\nthe McMahon\u2019s, a family who often\nmake decisions on who should win\nthe various championships and special\nring matches. Most of the McMahon\u2019s\nhave taken part in wrestling bouts and\nhave been former champions in different wrestling classes.\nMax Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone.\nThe clear winner in an informal survey I carried out a couple of weeks ago\nwhere I asked \u2018Who controls or owns\nFormula One?\u2019\nNot to delve into the personal lives of\neither person, but I have never heard\nof a sport where two people have a significant authority over it.

This brings about a lack\nof innovation in the management of\nthe \u2018sport\u2019 and provides an environment where significant reliance on\nengineers and team bosses to provide\nthis innovation, whether that be legally\nor illegally.\nThe beauty of Formula One of the\npast was the fact that it was unadulter-ated. Pure. And dare I say it, danger-ous. Though I appreciate the leaps and\nbounds F1 has made in terms of protecting their drivers, nowadays every\nfortnight I half expect there to be another scandal when reading the back\npages of Monday morning\u2019s papers.\nI for one do not take notice of the re-sults. Unlucky for Button, this is probably the worst year to win the championship as it will more likely than not be\novershadowed by this year\u2019s escapades\nof certain constructors.\nTo conclude, though the engineers\nand drivers have every intention of\nplaying the sport as it should, the management of Formula One is a joke.\nMuch akin to Vince McMahon et al. at\nWWE.

It was\nquite amusing seeing the look on Tyson Gay\u2019s face at the end of the race,\nthe man clearly knew that he had been\nbeaten good and proper. I believe that\nafter Bolt\u2019s performance, Gay has now\nrealised that not only did he finish in\n2nd place, he is the 2nd best, i.e. there\nare no prospects of him displacing\nBolt. It must be a hard title to digest.\nI remember watching the 100m final and simply looking at the screen\nin sheer disbelief at how quick Bolt\nwas running down the track. I had the\nsame reaction when I saw him do the\n200m in 19.19s, that\u2019s an average of\nroughly 9.09s per 100m.\nBut Bolt\u2019s performance was not the\nonly one that caused some heads to\nturn in Berlin this year. Out of virtually\nnowhere, 18-year-old Caster Semenya\nfrom South Africa turned up and won\nthe women\u2019s 800m final by nearly 2.5s\nand, on top of that, her performance\nduring the season had improved by\nnearly seven seconds. This vast improvement in performance led to the\nInternational Association of Athletics\nFederations (IAAF), backed up with\ntests carried out by the South African\nathletics body, asking for a \u201cgender\nverification\u201d test before the final race\nin Berlin, a decision that has angered\nthe vast majority.\nRather unsurprisingly people began\nto rally around the 18-year-old, including the South African athletics chiefs\nThat girl has got some balls to win a race like that...\nJovan Nedi\u0107 Assistant Editor\nas well as numerous political parties\nin Africa, with the Young Communist League of South Africa claiming\nthat the decision made by the IAAF\n\u201csmacks of racism of the highest order.\u201d\nThe party said that \u201cIt represents a\nACROSS\n7 Hurricanes are moored in a place\nlike this (9)\n8 Centre of public debate for\nexpressing uncertainty (5)\n10 Weapon of war cuts short ill-conceived armistice (8)\n11 Neutron without charge in its\nconstituent bits can get you excited\n(4-2)\n12 Slowly cover ground in Switzerland\n(4)\n13 A philosopher boxes in this manner\nto get placed first (8)\n15 Shorten a regular journey (7)\n17 Hollow drain-pipes burst to reveal\nsmall fish (7)\n20 Cause grief and give rage in a single\nword (8)\n22 German or Polish river (4)\n25 Pen with lustrous tip can be used to\nwrite on screens (6)\n26 Where short ideas are sent.

In the time-honoured tradition of such great papers as the Times,\nthe Telegraph, the Metro and the London Lite, we at felix publish a weekly\ncryptic crossword to make the sports\nsection worth reading.\nWe are currently looking for aspiring crossword setters to write for us as\nregularly as they would like. Please get\nin touch to sudoku.felix@imperial.\nac.uk if you think that might interest\nyou.\nUntil we can force someone to volunteer for the role, however. we will\nbe publishing puzzles from previous\nissues. This week\u2019s product was published in last year\u2019s freshers issue, and\nresulted in sufficiently few charges of\ngrievous bodily harm to be worth the\nrisk of reprinting.\nHopefully the weekly crossword\nwill help to distract from the pain of\nlectures, or at least make them seem\ntrivial by comparison.\nEnjoy the first week of term proper.\nEnoch\nof South Africa conveniently forgot\nthe brief gender issue with the current\n800m women\u2019s world record holder,\nJarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1.\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m sure that\nIAAF were relieved to see that initial\ntests indicated that Semenya had testosterone levels that were three times\nmore than the normal, giving them a\nmore solid ground for their claim.

This is a condition in\nwhich the body produces more andro-gen, a type of male hormone. If a girl\nhas it, she will usually have normal internal female reproductive organs, but\nmay not have periods and may have a\nmale appearance.\nIf they find out that she does have\nthis condition, then everything is fine,\nbut again, what would happen if she\nused to be a man? Would transsexuals\nbe allowed to compete at all? If they\nare allowed to compete, would they\ncompete in the male or female events?\nIf they used to be a male, then they\nwould have male muscles, which are\nbigger and more powerful clearly giving them an advantage. Even if they\ntake hormone supplements to make\nthem more female, would there still\nnot be an elevated level of testosterone in their body, levels that are higher\nthan in a normal female? I\u2019ll leave that\nto you dear readers to decide amongst\nyourselves wether or not they should\nbe allowed to compete.\nmentality of conforming feminine outlook within the white race, and that as\nlong as it does not fall within this race\nor starve and paint itself in order to\nlook like the white race it therefore is\nnot feminine.\u201d\nPersonally I\u2019m a little annoyed that\nthey would use the race card and I\nwould like to think that the IAAF\ndidn\u2019t make their decision based on\nthe physical appearance of Semenya.\nPerhaps the Young Communist League\nAn opinion piece centred on the non-Bolt fanfare of the World Athletics Championships 2009\n\n"

We\u2019re looking for enthusiastic\ngamers to write for our section \u2014 you\ndon\u2019t need to be a perfect writer to do\nit! You just need to love the thing you\u2019re\nwriting about, and as long as you can\ngive us that, we\u2019re really interested in\npublishing you.\nfelix Games is looking for a variety of\narticles this year, ranging from weekly\nnews roundups to columns with a\ntwist, as well as the usual dose of news,\nfeatures and the occasional review. We\n27\nfelix FRIDAY 09 OCTOBER 2009\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk GAMES\nWe make\ngood felix\nH\ney folks, and welcome\n(unless you\u2019re a fresh-er, in which case I\u2019ve\nbeaten this schtick to\ndeath already) to felix\nand another year of games coverage.\nWhile the folks at Another Castle beaver away to bring you a glossy, sexy-sex\nedition of their termly games maga-zine, we\u2019ll be doing our very best to get\nyou informed and entertained about\nthat hobby you don\u2019t like telling people\nyou meet about.\nI\u2019ve been following the Tim Langdell\nstory this week as it takes another in-teresting, and probably its final, turn.\nFor those who aren\u2019t aware, Langdell\nappeared to be bullying companies\nand individuals who had used the word\n\u201cEdge\u201d in their product title, claiming\nhe held the copyright to this term.\nIt came to the attention of the wider\ngames community when a highly-an-ticipated iPhone game got taken out\nof the Apple store after a claim filed\nagainst it by Langdell. They backed\noff, not having the legal werewithal to\nchallenge him for his ludicrous claims\n(Langdell himself has not actively used\nthe trademark for over a decade, but\nhas made plenty of claims) but the media picked it up and spread it around.\nA few small communities began following the story, documenting it and\nexposing some of the more ridiculous\naccusations being made. But nothing\nwould have come of it, I don\u2019t think,\nhad Langdell not made a fatally stupid\nerror - goading Electronic Arts into\naction by making a claim against their\nstunningly beautiful first-person plat-former, Mirror\u2019s Edge.\nAnyone who\u2019s looking to take EA\non has balls, but they also have a lot\nof stupidity balancing it out. Recently,\nEA very quietly submitted a document petitioning for the removal of all\ntrademark claims made by Langdell,\nincluding those he did not attempt to\nuse against them. In one fell swoop,\nEA have cut through everything\nLangdell has and will now presumably\nbe putting their full legal and financial\nweight behind getting it through. It\u2019s\nquite astounding.\nThe reason why I like this story is because it shows how gaming is growing,\ngrowing enough to produce genuine\nvillains, as well as heroes. Langdell is\nan utter c**t, harassing journalists, developers and gamers themselves whenever he found himself being questioned\nor investigated. Ultimately, he hasn\u2019t a\nleg to stand on, but he knows he can\nmanipulate and scare people.\nBut in the end, the truth won out,\nand that\u2019s even nicer to see. The fact\nthat EA, typically the devil of the gaming world, stepped in to deal the killing blow was particularly interesting.\nIt might be a bit far-fetched to think it,\nbut I like to imagine a small smirk on\nGames Editorette\nThat was not\njournalism\nW\nelcome. I\u2019ll be editing a bit here and\nthere, mainly to an-tagonise Mike. For\ninstance, this week\nhis picture is a girl. This is funny! It\u2019s\nfunny because he\u2019s a girl.\nAnyway. Want to know what I\u2019ve\nbeen playing this week? Well too bad,\nbecause I\u2019ve been playing Jedi Academy too much to write about it. Oh\nright, that. Yeah. LucasArts, in a rare\nmoment of sanity, put more of their\ngames up so they could be paid mon-ey. This ingenious business proposal\nallows you to play some of the best\ngames ever made for cheap. Jedi Academy is not one of these.\nHowever, it is one of those games you\ncanplayoverandoveragainsaying:\u2018How\nhave I missed this?\u201d Because it\u2019s superb.\nIt\u2019s not merely that they give you a lightsaber from the start of the game, it\u2019s the\nwhole feel. By the time you\u2019re well into\nthe game, your force powers are easy to\nuse and very satisfying. The game knows\nwhat you want to do, so it throws more\nand more weak enemies at you, allowing\nyou to experience challenges in the most\nenjoyable way possible \u2013 seeing the force\npush throw six enemies onto their backs,\nfor instance, or mind-tricking a rocket-launcher into nuking his allies.\nIt\u2019s so much fun, I\u2019ve completely\nmissed the Left4Dead update which\nI really should\u2019ve been doing on a\nnightly basis. Not to worry, though, as\nLeft4Dead2 is just on the horizon. Grab\nthe 4-pack with a few mates, because it\nbrings the digital download price down\nto \u00a320, with free early access to the demo\nand a baseball bat in-game. Hugely\nworth it, provided you\u2019re not capped for\ndownloads.\nThis week, I\u2019m going to try and get\nback into GTA4. But a little more light-sabering is in order. I\u2019ve found a cheat\nthat enables limb removal. I love games.\nMichaelCook\nMichaelCook\nGames Editor\nTune in next time to see if our developer has managed to rival Spelunky. Our guess is not, though. Sorry, man.\nDiary of a Games Dev\nI\nam going to make some games.\nNot big games. Not good games.\nBut it\u2019s high time I stopped\nmoaning about Bioshock\u2019s terrible level design and starteed\ngetting out there and getting my hands\ndirty. So I\u2019m going to make some\ngames. And tell you about it.\nSpelunky is what pushed me to do\nit. Derek Yu\u2019s sublime platformer was\ncreated with a blend of sexy python\nprogramming (www.python.org) and\nthe slightly less sexy Game Maker program (www.yoyogames.com/make), an\napplication that he\u2019s seemingly pushed\nto its very limits in order to produce\nhis game.\nIt\u2019s inspiring mostly because it\u2019s so\nsimple, but it uses one single clever\nidea to underpin some great gameplay.\nThe randomness the levels feels right,\nit feels good. It\u2019s not true randomness,\nthe levels have basic templates which\nare embellished with details. And it\u2019s\nthat that gives off such a lovely aura of\nplayability.\nHowever, I won\u2019t be starting off that\nbig just yet. The first stop on my tour\nof gaming creation is the extremely\nsuper-simple realm of the text adven-ture. I say super-simple not because it\nis, but just because it pisses off people\nwho like making and playing them. In\nactual fact, interactive fiction is hugely\nhard to design and make, but I\u2019m really\ninterested in doing one.\nThis is partly because I played Make\nIt Good this summer (www.playthisth-ing.com/make-it-good) which is a\nfilm noir text adventure where you\u2019re\nsent to investigate a murder as a police detective. It\u2019s rendered so richly,\nwith so many lovely and unexpected\ngaming touches, that it\u2019s a joy to play.\nThe crime is intricately written to allow people to unpick it using their own\nInanewsemi-regularcolumn,amantriestomakesomegamesandtell\nyouaboutit.Thisweek-startingoff,\u2018research\u2019andbeingaDick.\nintelligence, with a time limit to make\nsure you don\u2019t spend too long solving\nit the first time around. I\u2019ve failed to\nsolve the crime three times now, with\na fourth run waiting for me next week.\nBut it\u2019s the logic, the common sense\nthat wraps the whole thing up and really sells it. It doesn\u2019t feel stupid or badly\ndesigned. I\u2019d like to do something like\nthat.\nI\u2019ve downloaded Inform 7 (www.in-form7.com) which seems to be a nice\nand friendly way to write these things.\nIt uses natural language to describe\nthe world and how it works, including\nthe definition of language rules. This\nmakes it much more approachable to\nsomeone like me, who\u2019s a messy twit\nwhen it comes to laying stuff out.\nI\u2019ll let you know how I get along, and\nhopefully I\u2019ll have something playable\nfor you all soon! Until then, take a look\nat Make It Good. It\u2019s superb.\nFancy writing for us?\nWho wouldn\u2019t? We\u2019re manly and stuff. Also; really sexy.\nwant to know what makes you tick,\nwhat you love about gaming,\nbecause that\u2019s the kind of\npassion that makes for good\nreading.\nWhy on God\u2019s Earth\nwould you want to do\nsuch a thing? Well, you\nmight put it on your CV\n\u2014 past writers for felix\nhave gone on to great\nthings; it\u2019s a fantastic\nopportunity to meet\nnew people, network\nwith members of the\ngames press and the\nwider industry itself.\nFormer felix editor\nOwain Bennallack went\non to edit Develop magazine as well as Edge Magazine\nand co-create Pocket Gamer,\nand we\u2019ve had plenty of\nother journalists go on to\ngreat things in other fields of journal-ism. We\u2019ve met Peter Molyneux, David\nBraben, the Introversion folks, Media\nMolecule and more.\nIf you\u2019d like to write for us,\ndrop us an email at games.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk. We\nweren\u2019t at Fresher\u2019s Fair, but\nwe do hope you came and\ntook a look at felix anyway\nand signed up.\nIf you\u2019ve sent us an email\nand we\u2019ve been too lazy\nto reply, you can get writing straight away. We\u2019re\nlooking for entries to our\nnew Tonight, felix... feature, which\nrequires about 600 words on a character you love. Alternatively, you can\nsend anything you\u2019ve been working\non, but bear in mind that we need\na good wordcount to fill a page\ncomfortably.\nGet in touch!\nAngryGeek\nAngryGeek\n\n"

The\nrecord is ultimately has an accessibility\nthat leaves mainstream success all but\ninevitable. - Kadhim Shubber\nALBUM\nPR have been pushing The Saturdays\nlike an expectant mother who\u2019s three\nweeks overdue. I don\u2019t want to be\nmean so I\u2019ll just say that whether or not\nthis single sells a lot of copies or not,\nit\u2019s just not interesting music, not at all.\n- Kadhim Shubber\nForget Marilyn Manson, it\u2019s music like\nthis that makes me want to blow up\na school, so that none of the children\never grow up to make music like this.\nAnyone who ever listens to this out of\nchoice is not human. They are a reptilian shape shifter and should you encounter one, I\u2019m pretty sure it is within\nthe law, if not required by law, to kill\nthem immediately.\nThe lyrics don\u2019t even make sense:\n\u201cforever is over\u201d? what does that even\nmean? Did you just find words with\nsimilar letters in them and put them\ntogether? This sounds like a sketch\nshow parody of how bad pop music is.\n- Alex Ashford\nTHE\nSATURDAYS\nFOREVER IS\nOVER\nEMI\nSINGLE\nIn my day drum & bass music was\nabout raving and skanking and waiting\nfor the bass to drop. With this single\nChase & Status have decided that it\u2019s\nnow about pop songs with an overused beat. It doesn\u2019t work and if it\u2019s the\nshape of things to come then I\u2019ll kill\nmyself. - Kadhim Shubber\nCHASE &\nSTATUS\nEND CREDITS\nFT. PLAN B\nMERCURY\nSINGLE\nIf the Saturdays are the epitome of\neverything bad about music right now,\nthis song is the epitome of what is good\nabout music right now. When I listen\nto this I think of a future utopia where\nhip hop and electro and indie all merge\ntogether like the Power Rangers mega-zord of modern music. - Alex Ashford\nKID CUDI\nFT. MGMT &\nRATATAT\nPURSUIT OF\nHAPPINESS\nSINGLE\nC\nonfidence is half the game\nand The Boxer Rebellion\nwere overflowing with it.\nThey walked on stage with\nan attitude that said \u201cWe know how\nfucking good our material is, and we\u2019re\ngoing to make you love every second\nof it\u201d.\nThey didn\u2019t fail to deliver, with every\nsong the cheering simply grew louder\nand by the end of the gig most fans had\ntheir hands permanently in the air. The\nmix of mainly 30+ lads and lasses were\nheld firmly under the spell of frontman Nathan Nicholson\u2019s (\u201cwell fit\u201d according to my companion) impressive\nvocals. He switched seamlessly from\nghostly falsetto during \u201cFlashing Red\nLight Means Go\u201d to screaming lunatic\nas he dived over the barrier to party\nwith fans for \u201cWatermelon\u201d. Despite\nthe belting delivery, he made it look\nlike a walk in the park (although his\nsweat drenched shirt gave the game\naway. He was outdone by guitarist\nTodd Howe who genuinely had sweat\ndripping from his fingertips).\nIt\u2019s often been said that the band\nwrites music designed for large arenas\nand this sentiment exactly sums up the\nsensation of hearing them perform live.\nThe guitar, drums and vocals seem to\nhang in the air above you giving the im-pression, even in a small venue like the\nGarage, that they\u2019re playing to a packed\nWembley Arena. The impact is that\nThe Boxer Rebellion @ Garage\nyou\u2019re left with the sensation of the epic.\nLuckily this was tempered to a certain extent, in part by the bands exuberance and charisma but also by the\nincreased intimacy of their new material from album Union as opposed to\ntheir 2005 debut EXITS.\nIn short, armed with some sweet\nmaterial, The Boxer Rebellion blew the\ncrowd away. - Kadhim Shubber\nT\nhere is an old adage that says;\n\u2018if you speak, they will listen.\u2019\nThis did not hold true for\nNoah and the Whale, who\ngrew increasingly frustrated as a significant section of the audience privately\nconversed. \u2018You can talk about the gig\nafterwards,\u2019 urges frontman Charlie\nFink. Would it be cynical to suggest\nthat an enthralling performance would\nremedy this situation? Quite possibly,\nbut nonetheless Noah and the Whale\nhit somewhat wide of the mark this\nevening, often drifting into monotony\nto the point of being disinteresting. It\nprobably doesn\u2019t help that female accompaniment has now been deemed\nsurplus to demands, which would\noften add a much needed contrast to\nFink\u2019s often invariant vocals.\nRespite is redeemed within the bands\nmost jaunty, jangley songs such as Jocasta and 5 Years Time. When the latter begins, naturally the talking transforms into singing as sections of the\ncrowd remember why they attended\nthis evening. This seemed to be a stage\ntoo big for this band to fill, resulting in\na stagnant atmosphere where the most\ncrowd participation was in the form of\nhissed shushes.\nAs far as the performance goes,\nthere was little to be overwhelmed by.\nThey felt like a band running through\nthe motions, with the exception of the\nviolinist trying to shred his bow during\na prolonged middle eight. Fink occasionally stepped away from the micro-Noah & The Whale @ KOKO\nThe Boxer Rebellion\nGarage, Highbury\n6th October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nphone and hunched over his guitar, as\nif he couldn\u2019t decide between rock or\ntwee.\nTo be fair to them, when they write a\ndecent pop song, it really works. Their\nballads are also not bad but there seems\nto be a real lack of depth and variation\nin their repertoire which seems to be\nthe prime culprit to not maintaining\nthe crowds attention.\n- Christopher Walmsley\nLive\nNoah & The Whale\nKOKO, Camden\n2nd October\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nCHRISTOPHER WALMSLEY\nDANIELLE CARRICK\n\n"

INSTEAD, FELIX BRUSHES UP TO CELEBRATE ITS 60th ANNIVERSARY IN STYLE.\nC\nome the 9th of December, felix will celebrate its diamond\njubilee as the student newspaper of Imperial College.\nAs part of the celebrations, the weekly\nmasthead will feature a newly designed\nlogo whose design is inspired by the\nvery first logo from 1949.\nThe felix logo has traditionally featured Felix the Cat, the official mascot\nand creature-sake of the newspaper. In\nyears gone by the cat has adorned the\npages of felix in a variety of incarna-tions; from sabre-toothed tabby cats to\nmore predatory pumas and tigers.\nThe upcoming academic year will\nsee the feline\u2019s original form reinstated\non the front pages of the newspaper.\nOur Layout Editor and resident graphic designer Carlos Karingal scanned\nin archived issues from 1949 to adapt\nthe original logo into a cleaner, modernised version. Alongside subtle\nmodifications to the left eye, arm and\npaws, the cat is now silhouetted and set\nagainst a black ring.\nDespite the frequent remodelling\nover the years, the outgoing iteration\nhas proven to be the most popular with\npast Editors. The distinctive \u2018knight\u2019\nfeatured a humanised cat holding a\nshield, sword and cape in full colour.\nIt was soon incorporated into an official crest that was heavily utilised in\neditions of Felix throughout the 1980s\nand 1990s.\nIts popularity came to light in 1999,\nwhen Editor Dave Roberts made the\ndecision to replace the \u2018knight\u2019 with\nsilhouette of a leaping cat; featureless\nand barely recognisable as Felix.\nThe following year, all feline connotations were removed wholesale\nfrom the paper\u2019s artwork. Instead, a\npair of scowling human eyes stared\nat the reader from the masthead. The\ncat made its return upon the arrival of\nWill Dugdale as Editor, albeit in a novel\n\u2018sabre-toothed\u2019 form.\nAs Dugdale\u2019s tenure as Editor came\nto an end, Dave Roberts resurrected\nthe \u2018knight\u2019 from the dark depths of\nthe 1990s. Five years on and the knight\nhas since been incorporated into the\nFelix masthead in two forms: the first\nwith full crest and motto: \u2018keep the cat\nfree\u2019, and the second as a circled, lone\nsilhouette (which was used right up to\nthis past year).\nFelix was said to have spawned from\nPhoenix, the arts magazine at College\nset up by the now legendary author\nH.G. Wells. Phoenix had become the\ncentral publication on campus, and\nthere was ever-increasing pressure to\nreport news and goings-on in College.\nPrior to 1949, Phoenix had started to\nfeature current affairs articles amongst\nthe arts and culture submissions. The\nPhoenix editors subsequently took the\ndecision to create a fortnightly College\nnewspaper, with its name thought to\nbe a pun on its parent publication.\nThe first issue was released on the\n9th of December and cost each student\nonly 3 pence.\n60 years on, Felix, in his very first\nform, has returned.\nLeft to right: The \u2018knight\u2019 iteration of Felix the Cat, the original cat from 1949, and the updated version for this year\nImperial in University\nChallenge 1st round victory\nImperial College London is through\nto the second round of the BBC\u2019s University Challenge, as the team led by\nphysicist Gilead Amit triumphed over\nSouthampton University.\nAlong with teammates Simon Good\n(3rd year Physics), Ciaran Healy (2nd\nyear Chemistry), Benedict Nicolson\n(4th year Maths) and Edward Brightman (3rd year Earth Science postgrad-uate), Imperial scored 175 points while\nSouthampton gained only 135.\nThe team was joined by the felix\nmascot (right) and with two physicists\non a team which failed to correctly define capacitance.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Imperial\nhas acquitted itself well on the famous\nquiz show. University Challenge was\nwon by Imperial in 1996 and also in\n2001, a victory followed by a second\nplace in 2002.\nThe current plans are for Imperial\nto return to our screens when the 2nd\nround airs on the 30th of November.\nThe show will be broadcast in\ndaVinci\u2019s.\nKadhim Shubber\nKadhim Shubber News Editor\nWant to be one of the Rector\u2019s Ambassadors?\nEmily Govan\nEmily Govan Imperial College\nWe are looking for enthusiastic, confident and engaged Imperial students\nto volunteer as the official Imperial\nstudent ambassadors.

    "content": "12 felix FRIDAY 09 OCTOBER 2009\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCOMMENT\nI\nhave milk intolerant cats and I\nam now questioning my entire\nexistence!\nIf my cats were people they\nwould be prissy fashionistas not\nAristocats! Their attitude can, I sup-pose, be partly attributed to the fact I\nhave taken to referring to them under\nthe pseudonym of pharaohs of ancient\nEgypt or translations like \u201clittle king\u201d.\nOne such example of their insanity\nis their refusal to relinquish their fur\ncoats, they insist upon wearing even in\nthe heat of the English summer! And\nnow as the headline suggests they have\nselected to vomit up any food which\ndoes not suit their delicate palates\nonly to then gorge in the middle of the\nnight on rich sauced meats and alco-hol. Should this bulimia continue, they\nshall have to be sectioned. (I should\nmake clear at this point in the summer,\nI have been living alone for two weeks\nand it\u2019s all getting rather Howard\nHughes. Any alcohol consumed by my\ncats was not forced consumption, but\nsimply passive inhalation of fermentation fumes).\nAnyway I am rather disillusioned\nwith the new \u201crep\u201d my cats are getting\nfor themselves...I would say they were\neven on the \u2018erb (catnip) but I fear (as\nI am sure they do) that would be buying into the stereotype too much...late\nnight parties, fine dining, fine clothes\nand drugs. No no, no one wants their\nimage to be completely contrived;\nthere\u2019s nothing worse in fashion.\nI was reading something the other\nday in the Guardian supplement magazine (not because i am cultured enough\nto sit and read the Guardian \u2013 it was\non the floor of a train, so rather I am\ncourteous enough to pick up rubbish);\nsee now you\u2019re getting a better picture\nof who I am. Taken in by the picture on\nthe front I decided to read on. Bear in\nmind my screening process for literature of worth at this point is anything\nthat can top the all so nail-biting \u201cno\nsmoking\u201d sign. Though newspapers\nrarely make the cut, not due to their\ncontent, rather their constitution, they\nleave that horrid inky residue, making\nyou look like you\u2019ve had fisticuffs with\na chimney sweep. I would much rather\nbreeze through glossy magazine pages\nor paw the pages of a new book where\nat least the print is fixed to the paper.\nI would prefer the phrase \u201cthe words\nleapt off the page\u201d to remain a meta-phor. I understand papers are kept\ncheap to provide news for hoi polloi,\nbut I will not support this effort to illuminate the masses by allowing people\nto read my forehead should I mistakenly mop my brow after reading. Not\nto worry, they will probably be offering\nfree disposable gloves with every paper\nsoon to decrease the spread of swine\nflu, every cloud...\nI digress! The article in the aforementioned supplement (other supplements\nare available , for example, \u2018Fabulous\u2019\nwith a heartfelt interview with Peter Andre and how much he loves his\ngodamn kids) brought up \u2018The URGE\u2019\nThe tag line reads \u2018ever been tempted\nby the perverse?\u2019 Standing on the edge\nof a high cliff and suddenly thinking\nand pondering with great intensity,\nwhat if I jumped?! Standing a little too\nclose to the platform edge or having\nthoughts of swerving into oncoming\ntraffic? All are possible symptoms of\nThe Urge. It seems the fear of death\nplays a big role and toying with the\nthought of our mortality. One suggestion for the origin of such thoughts is\nthat it is a safety mechanism; by imagining the most catastrophic outcome\nof our actions it forces us to \u2018back away\nfrom the edge\u2019.\nOne such minor example of the\nurge manifested in myself is; pushing\nagainst a pane of glass. I have old sash\nwindows at home and when rain hits\nthe glass \u2013 it gives that brittle twang\nthat makes it seem like it could shatter\neasily, so sometimes I push really hard\nwith my index finger on the window\nand tempt it to crack. (Insert pun regarding my mental state!)\nConversely, the desire to not react,\nprocrastination; another trait I exhibit\nwithout abeyance. Something of the\nhighest importance needs to be done\n\u2018now-or-never\u2019 and yet you find yourself putting it off until tomorrow, for\nno other reason than to force yourself\ntantalisingly close to the reality you do\nnot wish to see.\nThe article did however reassure us\nthat these feelings are probably completely natural, helpful even, and compared this phenomenon to that of a\ntoddler testing boundaries. It is all part\nof personal development. Or not.\nCould it be part of a desire to break\nfree? To break away from the monot-ony? To shake up your life and spark\nyou into action! Like a volcano \u2013 surges of intense readiness to burst, often\nqwelled, but with an uneasy reverberation that leaves you unsteady yet\nexhilarated. And in a world where you\ncould find yourself trailing along with\nthe masses, doing the standard 9 to 5\nthing and falling foul of all the social\nnorms you never thought you would,\nyou might just be tempted to stand\npast the yellow line.\nOr else \u2013 is it this new obsession with\nThe X Factor? With everyone believing\nthey could be the special one, that they\nare utterly unique, they are extraor-dinary, that forces us into the outra-geous, if only to prove we can stand\nout in a crowd.\nMaybe we are just bored.\nVicki Masding has some odd cats\n\u201cStanding on the\nedge of a high\ncliff and suddenly\nthinking and\npondering with\ngreat intensity,\nwhat if I jumped?!\u201d\nI\u2019m done with being nice for the Freshers\u2019 sake, almost...\nDan Wan\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief\nW\nelcome back to Imperial. Old habits die hard\nand I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve\npicked up felix once\nagain. I bet you\u2019ve missed holding the\nslightly crispy collection of pages each\nweek, desperately flicking through\nthem to find something even a fraction\nmore entertaining than what you\u2019re\nmeant to be doing.\nFor those who have picked up this paper for the first time, thank you and well\ndone on finally becoming a proper Imperial student. Whether you like or hate\nfelix and its twisted sense of humour,\nyou haven\u2019t stitched yourself into the\nsocial fabric of College until you\u2019ve read\nthen thrown us to the floor in vigorous\ndisgust, delight or boredom.\nTo those whom I haven\u2019t yet had the\npleasure of being introduced, I\u2019m Dan,\nand I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all mistakenly voted\nme in as Editor.\nDespite appearances, I\u2019ve been working hard, albeit sporadically, over the\nsummer. The will to leave South Kensington for more than a day at a time\nfights a constant battle with the joy and\nrushes I get from doing my work as Editor. I\u2019ve already produced the Freshers\u2019\nHandbook and the Freshers\u2019 issue of\nfelix. I think I\u2019m done with being artificially chirpy for the sake of the Freshers. I\u2019m extremely delighted to return to\nspitting nails at the rest of you! I jest.\nTo those familiar with felix, you\u2019ll\nhave noticed a redesign, from masthead\nto paper size. I hope you like it. Some\nof the changes were necessary and most\nwere unnecessary, but I hope it is the\ncontent that you define felix with. As\nI promised in my overly-strung mani-festo, the news will be feature-led and\nthere will be a return of student-drawn\ncomics and an agony aunt.\nFor those who remembered, Needy\nMcNeedy departed our ranks two years\nago. I still see her wandering around the\nUnion craving cheap and dirty pints,\nher addictions have got the better of\nher, and a comeback was categorically\noff the cards. Instead, we\u2019ve recruited\nthe socially-skewed mind of Aunty\nMcPickle. Check out her ramblings in\nthe extended Coffee Break section.\nOne welcome leads to many. We\nhave new Section Editors on board,\nnamely in Arts, Science, Technology,\nBusiness, and Politics. We hope you\nenjoy their ramblings.\nFelixonline.co.uk will be a website\nthat I\u2019ll be proud to showcase, and I\nhope everyone finds it simple and fun\nto use. You\u2019ll be able to see the latest\nstories with video accompaniment, and\nthen spew your verbal ejaculation onto\nour discussion boards.\nI want to thank both Chris Birkett\nand Ravi Pall on behalf of the entire felix team for their effort and time given\ntowards the website this summer. Anyone that sees them should immediately\noffer them a hug and pint, in whichever\norder preferable. The website should be\nup and running in the near future, so\nlook out for it. No doubt, we\u2019ll dance\nand shout about it when it\u2019s finally\nlaunched.\nThen there was my promise to open\nup felix as a club. From here on in, I\u2019d\nconsider every student at Imperial a\nmember. Those who read it are also the\nones that could potentially write for it.\nThose who don\u2019t read it also have an\nequal chance of writing for it. We don\u2019t\nexpect masterpieces coming through\nour mailboxes everyday; we expect\nthings written with interest and pas-sion. You can submit an article to any\nsection of the paper. We are in no position to refuse the submission of a reasonable article written by an Imperial\nstudent.\nIf you missed us at Freshers\u2019 Fair, first\noff: shame on you for not coming to\nfind us as soon as you stepped foot onto\nsoggy ground that morning. Secondly,\nit doesn\u2019t really matter if you didn\u2019t see\nus. There\u2019s no boat to miss, and you can\nwrite, edit and have a bit of a laugh with\nfelix whenever you want throughout\nthe year.\nI\u2019ve probably said this a million times\nto so many of you, but if you see me\naround College, pick my brains. If you\ndon\u2019t see me around College, come\ndown to the felix office in the West\nWing of Beit Quad.\n\u201cI hope you like the\nnew design. Some\nof the changes were\nnecessary and most\nwhere unnecessary,\u201d\n\n"

The Academy provides\nfull room and board for the players as\nwell as a free education; all they have\nto do in return is train in the morning\nand evenings. With all the hours these\nathletes put in, it was inevitable that\nthe standard was going to be high. This\nwas a fact that Chandigarh knew all\ntoo well and their arrogance knew no\nbounds when they decided to put out a\nside full of 16-18 year olds.\nAt 18:00, after the formalities of\nmeeting various officials, their boys\nwent out to play our men in the hot\nand sweaty Chandigarh Hockey Stadium, which had roughly 400 spectators\nready to watch the match. The Imperial team, running out in their mustard\nyellow tops, started off well with some\nsolid defence and threatening attacks,\nhowever, their attempts were fruitless\nand the score remained 0-0 for the first\nten minutes. It was at this point that\nthe heat and humidity started to affect the Imperial men with substitutes\ncoming on and fast as they were coming off.\nUnfortunately the heat had no affect on the home side who effortlessly scored four goals in the space of\nten minutes, despite the best efforts\nof Chris Baker-Brian, Chris O\u2019Reilly\nand Man of the Match Owen Connick (Charles Murdoch was distinctly\naverage!)\nEventually Imperial found the faintest of weaknesses on the right hand\nside of the Chandigarh defense, with\nSachin Jivanji breaking down the right\nhand side before crossing it in for Captain Ewan Quince to score a diving\ngoal leaving the score at half time 4-1\nto the hosts.\nThe second half didn\u2019t see the best\nof starts for Imperial, with Chandigarh\nscoring another four goals in the first\nten minutes. To add salt to the already\ngaping wound, Captain Ewan Quince\ntold his team at half time that: \u201c4-1 is\nnot a bad score, we\u2019re still in it if we\nplay sensibly for the first ten minutes!\u201d\nThere was no doubt amongst the Imperial squad; the Chandigarh players\nwere clinical in attack.\nDespite their best attempts, Imperial\nwere unable to penetrate the Chandigarh defence, something that left striker Daniel Lundy very frustrated after\nnot being able to find the back of the\nnet for the full 60 minutes that he was\non the pitch. With the game reaching\nits conclusion, Chandigarh managed to\nscore three more times leaving the final\nscore 11-1 to the hosts.\nThe second match of the night saw a\nswarm of mosquitos, flys, bats and all\nmanner of bugs replace the sweltering\ntemperatures in the stadium. Despite\nthis, the ladies, led by Captain Teddy\nMiddlebrok, went out fighting (both\nthe bugs and the players) with Emma\nBeresford popping up all over the\npitch, something that caught the\nattention of a certain 13 year old\nIndian boy who wanted her phone\nnumber.The attack of the Chandigarh ladies was a vicious as\nthe men\u2019s, however, goal keeper and Man of the Match\nJess Purcell pulled out\nsome spectacular saves,\nas did Suzie Squire who\nmanaged to scrape\nthe ball away from\nher own goal line\nfrom a Chandigarh short cor-ner. Imperial\u2019s\nattack performed\nadmirably with\nspecial mention\ngoing to Katie Cullen who played her first\ngame in seven months.\nDespite their best ef-forts, the Imperial ladies\nfinished the match without\nscoring a single goal and the final score being 11-0 to the home\nside.\nIn the early hours of the following morning, the touring side got up\nfor the mixed match, with the push-back at 07:00. Again Chandigarh displayed some tremendous arrogance by\nputting out a side full of U13 players,\nwhich led to two-time Twat of the Day\nNick Jones boldly saying: \u201cIs it OK if I\nrun around all of them and score on\nmy own?\u201d... He did not! Jones\u2019 massive\nego took a beating when a 10 year old\nmanaged to knock him over on one of\nSCORES\nImperial Men\u2019s XI 1\nChandigarh Hockey Academy 11\nImperial Women\u2019s XI 0\nChandigarh Hockey Academy 11\nImperial Mixed XI 2\nChandigarh Hockey Academy 5\nhis runs, something that was going to\nbe the theme of the day. Phil Kloucek\nalso had a bit of a tommy tumble when\nhe fell over a Chandigarh player whilst\nKavit Nathwani had a similar fall after\na spectacular swing-and-a-miss.\nOther notable incidents included\nDouglas Blackie introducing a\nsmall Indian players face to\nthe astro and then blaming\nhim for being too small\nand also to Charles Murdoch whose first touch\non the pitch resulted in\na P-Flick to the home\nside, unfortunately goal\nkeeper Alex Summers\nwas unable to stop it going in. In complete contrast (and I mean com-plete!), the Chandigarh\ngoalkeeper, who was nine\nyears old and four-foot-fuck-all tall managed to save\nTeddy Middlebrooks P-Flick.\nThe game itself was actually an eventful one, with Chris\nBaker-Brian and Luke Reynolds\nboth managing to score for Imperial. Unfortunately, this was\nnot enough and the final score\nended at 5-2 to Chandigarh.\nAs you can see, the\nheadlines that appeared\nin the Indian newspapers were fairly accurate,\nbut everyone left India\nwith their spirits high, especially after\nseeing their faces on the sports pages\nof a paper which isn\u2019t felix.\n\u201cThe second match\nsaw a swarm of\nmosquito\u2019s, fly\u2019s,\nbats and all manner\nof bugs replace\nthe sweltering\ntemperatures in the\nstadium\u201d\nSiten Mandalia on the defence against one of the Chandigargh Academy players in the mixed match\nABOVE: The ladies line\nup for the formalities\nbefore the start of their\nmatch\nLEFT: Teddy\nMiddlebrook winding\nup for a big hit\n\n"

    "content": "29\nfelix FRIDAY 09 OCTOBER 2009\nFOOD\nFood Editor\nFood Editor APPLY NOW!!\nAPPLY NOW!!\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe science behind chilli\u2019s hot hot heat\nT\nhis is a new series of articles on the science of\nfood and cooking. In\nweeks to come, I\u2019ll be\nlooking at the reasons\nas to why foods taste the way they\ndo, and how cooking processes go\ntowards producing delicious dishes.\nChillies are one of the oldest spices\nin the world, with evidence that they\nwere used in Ecuadorean cooking over\n6,000 years ago. They were an important part of Aztec cooking, with the\ndefinition of fasting being abstaining\nfrom chilli and salt. Aztecs made a bit-ter, frothy chocolate drink called xocolatl with chilli, vanilla and honey. This\nwas associated with the goddess of fer-tility, Xochiquetzal and was favoured\nby nobility. Christopher Columbus was\none of the first Europeans to encounter\nchillies, and Diego Alvarez Chanca, a\ndoctor on Columbus\u2019 second voyage to\nthe West Indies, took chillies back to\nthe Old World. Today, world production and consumption of chilli is twenty times that of black pepper, the next\nmost popular spice.\nChilies are the fruits of the Capsicum\ngenus, members of the Solanaceae, or\nnightshade family, renowned for producing interesting alkaloids. For exam-ple, tobacco produces nicotine, green\npotatoes produce toxic solanine, and\ndeadly nightshade produces atropine,\nwhich can be used to treat a flatline\nduring cardiac arrest. Within chillies,\nthe seed-bearing tissue known as the\nplacenta contains capsaicin-secreting\nglands. Seeds get their heat when the\nplacenta splits, allowing capsaicin to\nleak onto them. So if you want to get\nthe flavour of chillies without all the\nheat, you can remove the spongy ribs\nand seeds before cooking.\nCapsaicin has the chemical formula\n8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide. It\nbelongs to the chemical class of alkyl\namides, which are also produced by\nblack pepper and ginger plants. These\ndiffer from the isothiocyanates produced by horseradish and mustard, in\nthat they act primarily in the mouth.\nWhile isothiocyanates are small, volatile molecules, which float into the\nnose and sinuses and act there, alkyl\namides, are bigger, so remain on your\ntongue. This is why mustard \u201cgets up\nyour nose\u201d, while chilli and black pepper make your mouth burn.\nCapsaicin is fairly insoluble in water,\ndue to the fatty side chain sticking off\nthe vanillin ring in its structure. This\nis why drinking water doesn\u2019t really\nrelieve pain caused by chillies. Once\nyou\u2019ve eaten chillies and want to stop\nthe burning, drinking milk or yoghurt\ncan help, due to the fats and a milk protein called casein having a detergent\neffect on capsaicin. Alcohol, preferably\nneat vodka, can also help, as capsaicin\nis both fat and alcohol soluble. Without\na remedy, capsaicin-induced pain generally subsides within fifteen minutes.\nChillies produce capsaicin as a secondary metabolite \u2013 an organic compound\nnot directly involved in the plant\u2019s\ngrowth, development or reproduction.\nSo it\u2019s reasonable to assume that it has\nevolved for a purpose. To find out that\npurpose, we can look at how capsaicin\naffects animals in the wild. Excluding humans, mammals learn to avoid\nchillies due to the pain they cause.\nMammals\u2019 teeth grind up chillies and\ndestroy the seeds, wasting the investment the plant has made in the fruits\nin order to reproduce.\nOn the other hand, birds swallow\nchillies whole, protecting the seed.\nThey also disperse seeds further than\nmammals might, as they fly. So it\nshould come as no surprise that birds\nare totally immune to capsaicin and\ncannot taste it. The only other animals\nthat regularly eat chillies are Homo\nsapiens, but we are definitely not immune to their effects!\nThe effects on the human body are\nmany and varied. The most obvious\nis the burning sensation in the mouth\n\u2013 or elsewhere if you forget to wash\nyour hands. Capsaicin chemically\nstimulates receptors on the tongue and\nmucous membranes to\nrelease calcium ions, triggering pain signals to\nthe brain.\nA side effect of these signals is the release of endorphins, which act as painkillers and produce a good feeling. In\naddition, as Heston Blumenthal found\non putting a colleague in an MRI scan-ner, parts of the limbic system of the\nbrain including the cingulate cortex\nand amygdala are activated when chillies are tasted, indicating an emotional\nresponse.\nCapsaicin also increases metabolic\nrate and affects thermoregulation,\nmaking the body feel hotter and inducing cooling mechanisms such as swea-ing and vasodilation.\nChilies are the fruits of the Capsicum genus, that originated in the Americas: Aw, so pretty, yet so HOT.\nfelix\u2019s new food guru, Jade Dickinson gets technical about the fruits that were meant to keep you away\nFinally, here are two chilli-based recipes to try:\nPenne All\u2019Arrabiata\nPeel the garlic and cut in half. Heat the oil in a pan and\nadd the garlic and chillies. Brown the garlic, stirring\nwith a wooden spoon, and then use the spoon to\nremove and save both. Put the basil in the hot oil for\na few moments to flavour it, then remove. Add the\ntomatoes and season. Return the chillies and cook\nfor 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the penne in boiling\nsalted water until al dente. Drain. Add the garlic and\nbasil to the pasta. Now, this is the key step. Remove\nthe chillies from the sauce. Take one and squeeze the\nseeds out of the chilli and into the sauce. Stir and test\nfor spiciness. Continue adding chilli to the sauce until\nit suits your taste. Stir the pasta into the tomato sauce.\nServe with Parmesan to grate.\n350g penne pasta\n3 garlic cloves\n400g tin chopped tomatoes\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n3 dried chilies\ntwo handfuls fresh basil\nXocolatl\nThe original drinking chocolate.\nBoil the kettle. Mix a small amount of boiling water with\ntwo teaspoons of cocoa powder in a saucepan.\nTake a large dried red chill and bruise slightly, then add to\nthe saucepan along with two tablespoons of honey and\none split vanilla pod (or one teaspoon vanilla essence).\nAdd enough milk to make one mug, and bring slowly to a\nsimmer.\nTaste a little for spiciness, and when it is ready, remove the\nchilli and vanilla pod and pour into a mug. For a treat, add\nsome double cream.\nThis is surprisingly tasty, with the\ndried chilli giving it a smoky note and\na bit of a kick.\nCombined with the vanilla and\nhoney, this makes a more grown up\nhot chocolate, rivaling tea or coffee\nas the perfect hot drink.\nServes 4\n\n"

A\nfew beers with the freshers turned into\npints of gin and tonic, and falling asleep\non three busses trying to get home. As\nI said, good night. However I am a little bemused as to how the whole of my\nbody hurts, and how I have managed\nto spend every penny in my wallet. Literally every single penny. This is not\nthe first time it has happened either.\nHow does that happen? I am under the\nimpression that when a bit smashed I\nmanage to barter a pint of Fosters for\n\u00a31.86 because that\u2019s all I have left. Either that or I just lose it.\nAnyway, whilst on the subject of\ndrink, I met a Scottish pissed bloke\non a bus over the summer. I am sure\nwe have all been in a similar situation\nas every bus appears to have recruited\ntheir own late night pissed bloke, but\nthis one was different. I tried my best\nto ignore him, and even used the tried\nand testes nod-and-smile method.\nHowever I soon realised that he was\nhilarious. Never before in my life have\nI met someone who has the ability to\ntalk so knowledgeably on a subject that\nhe clearly have no clue about. Not even\na taxi driver. In the journey home, he\ntold me about the \u2018horses putting their\ntails over the wall and fucking shitting\u2019\nand about the \u2018fucking huge gun pal\u2019\nin Chelsea barracks. We also touched\nupon the subject of the Albert Hall and\n\u2018its fucking shit sound\u2019 and offered me\nan insight into how to fix it.\nAfter a while he waved a bottle at\nme and asked \u2018you want some of this\npal? Fucking brilliant.\u2019 I told him that\nno, I didn\u2019t, especially as it looked like\nmedicine. To this he laughed, and told\nme that it was in fact medicine. I very\nmuch doubt that he could produce a\nprescription if asked. He then went on\nto shouted at some Americans coming up the stairs, assuring them \u2018that\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a fucking yank,\nwe\u2019re all friends on this fucking bus.\u2019\nFollowed by a heavily accented version\nof The Beatles\u2019 Hey Jude. It wasn\u2019t very\ngood.\nSo, if you happen to be on a bus and\na pissed Scottish bloke starts to tell you\nabout the world whilst offering you\nmedicine, he\u2019s actually very amusing!0\nStuff Imperial students like:\n2. Reduced:\nI don\u2019t know whether it is solely\nImperial students who like the\nreduced section of Tescos, or all\nstudents... but we do love a good\nbargain. Before now I have come\nhome with a mushroom risotto despite the fact that I don\u2019t like mush-rooms, or risotto for that matter.\nBut it was reduced so my head told\nmy hand that I did, ergo I should\nbut it. I ended up throwing it in the\nbin after one mouthful.\nHowever there is no better feeling than going to the shops to buy\nyour dinner and picking it up for\n\u2018special price\u2019. soon you freezer will\nbecome stocked with all kinds of\nexotic foodstuffs that you will never\nbe able to eat due to elongated defrosting times. Regardless of this\nfact you will still feel it necessary to\ncontinue in your one man quest to\npersonally rid you local supermarket of all its almost-gone-off food.\nYes, they\u2019re reduced!\nThomas L.

Dylan Lowe explores what travelling was three decades ago, and compares it what we know as \u2018tourism\u2019 today.\nT\nhe house glittered only\nwith lit candles and\noil lamps. It was nothing like the glamour\nof illumination \u2012 I say\nsquander of electricity \u2012 back at\nCoral View Resort. But then, when\none was cross-legged on the mat,\nbilos of kava passed around and\ndrained down throats under the\nthunderous claps, I saw it as utter\nbliss.\nBlissfully drunk on the narcotic pepper plant root, and blissfully isolated\nfrom my fellow resort residents.\nSo when I wasn\u2019t busy gulping, I\nturned my attention to my hosts, and\nmy short-term travel companion. Only\nearlier in the afternoon did I meet Junior over a resort staff\u2019s game of touch\nrugby, and in true Fijian fashion the\nconversation topic drifted to kava.\nHours later, not before the treacherous\nnear- pitch black jungle trek, we were\ntreated to hospitality in a stranger\u2019s\nhouse and surrounded by his entire,\nequally kava- fanatical, family.\nAnd wherever the magic drink goes,\ninteresting dialogues follow.\nJunior\u2019s father was busy flaunting his\ncollection of items, from the beautifully preserved antique guest book \u2012 the\nhousehold doubled as a guesthouse in\nthe \u201980s \u2012 to decades-old maps. They\nall, he explained, represented the regretfully passed days of travel, when\ntravellers could legitimately title themselves as adventurers.\nSeizing the opportunity, I dropped\nthe big question. If I can remember it\nright, alongside the numbness in my\nlips and limbs, I grew fascinated with\nthe priceless perspective of a local on\nhow travelling has changed since thirty\nyears ago.\n*\nThese were the first images to be\nconjured from my memory bank\nwhen STA Travelbuzz \u2012 I began\nworking for them as a travel blogger\nseveral months ago \u2012 asked me to\nwrite something about how much\ntravelling has changed for the last\nthirty years, the age of thirty being the birthday STA Travel has recently celebrated. And since I spent\nthe \u201980s being scattered molecules\nand part-time foetus, and the \u201990s\nas an unworldly toddler, I naturally\nrequired the wisdom of elders to\ncomplete my task.\nAnyone from Spain, a Greek island,\nor one of many European cultures\nof an older generation can tell you\nhow much tourism has drastically\nreshaped their homeland, from the\nmere increase of man-flow to the bigger landscape-reforming stuff. This is\nespecially true when the destination\ncomprises of long strips of white sand\nand warm seas.\nThis is the new manifestation of co-lonialism. For evidence look no further\nthan the hordes of tourist settlements\noccupying the Spanish coastline.\nBut hey, this isn\u2019t the \u2018change\u2019 in\ntourism that I am dwelling on with\nnostalgic sentiments \u2013 in European\nterms tourists nowadays merely have\nless perfume, more showers and horsepower compared to their counterparts\na century ago. It was what said on that\nbreezy August evening by Junior\u2019s dad,\nover the grog, that caught me sighing.\n*\nThe atmosphere wasn\u2019t sombre \u2013\nor sober \u2013 but the question raised\nsome seriousness in his tone.\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you think the Yasawa\nFlyer is bringing in too many tourists?\u201d I was referring to the catamaran that dumps senseless visitors daily onto the Yasawa island\ngroup, northwest of Fiji, like nuclear waste. Only moments ago, the\nmaster of the household was depicting the sole method of reaching\nthe outer islands in the olden days\n\u2013 by hitchhiking on fishing boats.\n\u201cIt brings jobs, opportunities,\ntechnology. The Yasawa Flyer\nmakes it easier for islanders to\ntravel to the mainland, and vice\nversa\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut what about cultural integrity?\u201d I gesture towards my resort.\n\u201cWhen most of those tourist come\nin they want to lie on the beach and\nsunbathe, not learning your cul-ture. Doesn\u2019t that bother you?\u201d\nIt did bother him.\nThere was that glint of nostalgia\nin his eyes when he spoke of the\nold-school kind of travellers back\nin the \u201980s. The ones who would\ncross mountain ranges and open\nseas just to reach a genuinely exotic\nlocation, and build genuine friendships with the indigenous folks and\nleave with enough moral obligations to return. Every signature in\nhis guest book was testimony that\nthis race of travellers exists.\nAnd there was this Canadian\nbook illustrator, who first came to\nthe island in 1985 and returned to\nstay for six months. He remains a\nregular visitor, despite the hefty\ndistance between Vancouver and\nFiji. He still speaks to the family on\nthe phone \u2013 in Fijian.\nOne subtle thing I have noticed\nabout our conversation \u2013 even\nthough I was mercifully intoxicated \u2013 was that the father spoke\nbetter English than his children,\nJunior and his brother Moses. One\nmay account this to the dwindling\nBritish influence in Fiji, an ex-col-ony, and consequently the decrease\nin English-orientated education.\nHowever, I saw a grimmer cause.\nWith more guests less willing to\nmingle with the resort staff, the\nlocals are more inclined to spend\ntime amongst themselves and converse in their local dialects. And\nwith the mutual respect between\nEnglish and Fijian speakers broken\ndown, English is treated as a language of the tyrannical \u2018masters\u2019\nand Fijian the local renaissance of\nthe free-spirited and oppressed.\nThis is especially true when many\ntourists, as I observed, go on holiday hoping to cast aside the suppression they endure during their\nnormal lives and expect to afford\nroyalty treatment. What they tend\nto forget is that, like themselves,\ntheir \u2018servants\u2019 are human beings\ntoo.\nMeanwhile, my \u2018servant\u2019 was\nnow escorting us back to our dor-mitories. It was pitch black in the\ntropical forests, with little illumi-The Yasawa Flyer, legendary island-hopping catamaran and waste disposal unit For cultural integrity, turn right; for lots of tourist money, turn left\n\n"

    "content": "14\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors\nScience Editors Nathan Ley & Brigette Atkins\nNathan Ley & Brigette Atkins\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix FRIDAY 09 OCTOBER 2009\nNICE (The National Institute for\nHealth and Clinical Excellence) is a\nhealth authority of the NHS. Its function is to publish appraisals on whether\nor not particular treatments should be\nconsidered for use by the NHS. NICE\nwas established partially as a result of\nthe controversy surrounding the \u2018post\ncode lottery\u2019 wherein particular treatments were given to patients based\non the geographical location of their\nhome. It is the body responsible for the\napproval of life-extending drugs, notably Herceptin and Revlimid.\nNICE invites consultee and commentator organisations to take part in the appraisal (these can include a variety of dif-ferentgroupswithwildlydifferingagendas\ni.e. manufacturers of competing drugs,\npatient groups, health care professionals\netc). Along with this, there is an academic\ncentre which collates all the information\non the drug undergoing appraisal and prepares a report. Interplay between these\nbodiesandafurtherindependentappraisal\ncommittee leads to the creation of an appraisal consultation document which is\nsubmitted to NICE for approval.\nIt\u2019s all rather professional and transparent really. NICE appraisals are\nbased on calculations and evaluations\nof drugs according to cost-effective-ness in specific life scenarios. In other\nwords, it\u2019s a trade off between money\nand life. Sound dodgy? You know, the\nwhole quantifying the value of life\nthing? Well it shouldn\u2019t.\nQALY stands for quality adjusted\nlife year. This is a quantitative measure used to guage the health benefits\nprovided by a treatment regime. This is\ncalculated as the number of years that\nwould be added as a result of the treat-ment, with each year in perfect health\nassigned a value of 1.0, through to immediate death with a value of 0. Problems arise in that some argue that there\nare health states worse than death, and\nthat therefore as a result there should\nbe negative values possible on the\nhealth spectrum. Also, determining\nthe level of health depends on measures that some argue can place disproportionate importance on physical\npain or disability over mental health.\nThe effects of a patient\u2019s health on the\nquality of life of others (e.g. caregivers or family) do not figure into these\ncalculations.\nThe weighting values of between 0\nand 1 are usually determined by methods such as the following: Time-tradeoff (TTO), Visual Analogue Scale, and\nStandard Gamble, as explained in the\nright hand box.\nHowever, the weight assigned to a\nparticular condition can vary greatly,\ndepending on the population being\nsurveyed. For example those who do\nnot suffer from the affliction in question are on average more likely to\noverestimate the detrimental effect on\nquality of life, compared to those who\nare afflicted.\nQALY is used in cost-utility analysis\nto calculate the ratio of cost against\nQALYs saved for a particular health\ncare intervention (i.e. an older more\nestablished drug that may have a lower\nefficacy). This is then used to allocate\nhealthcare resources (finite resources\nprovided by the taxpayer also required\nfor other medical purposes such as\nhelping keep babies alive - the other\nend of the spectrum), with an intervention with a lower cost to QALY\nsaved ratio being preferred and as a result chosen over an intervention with a\nhigher ratio. This method is controversial because it means that some people\nwill not receive treatment as it is calculated that the cost of the intervention\nis not warranted by the benefit to their\nquality of life (as a guideline, NICE ac-cepts, as cost effective, those interventions with an incremental cost-effec-tiveness ratio of less than \u00a320,000 per\nQALY, rising to \u00a330,000 on occasions)\nIts supporters argue that since health\ncare resources are inevitably limited,\nthis method enables them to be allocated in the way that is most beneficial\nto society relative to other treatments\ni.e. instead of most beneficial to the\nsingle patient. This makes logical sense\nin a way that most sane people can un-derstand. Finite NHS resources dictate\nthe necessity to prioritise some treatments over others.\nSince the UK is a welfare state, basic\nhealth care is fundamentally free to all\ncitizens in the sense that it is funded by\ngeneral taxation including national insurance contributions. This model, despite all criticism of the NHS, has been\ngenerally accepted as a good thing 60\nyears on. And so I hear you ask, \u201cwhy\nis this topical now and what does this\nhave to do with NICE\u201d. Well\u2026..this is\nwhere it gets a bit more political.\nIt seems as though our neighbours\non the other side of the pond have recently taken to a bit of NHS bashing,\nyou know, the whole \u201cevil\u201d \u201corwellian\u201d\nand \u201csocialist\u201d rhetoric. This wave of\nabuse came in response to murmurs\nfrom congressional republican town\nhall meetings of the proposal for state-sponsored \u201cdeath panels\u201d as part of\nObamas support for a completely publicly funded healthcare programme.\nSince then, the Obama administration\nhas announced they would support a\n\u2018health insurance cooperative\u2019, which\nrepresents a compromise from their\nstance earlier in the summer, but is at\nleast slightly progressive. The last time\na similar democratic health care plan\nwas proposed (the Clinton administration in 1993) it was shot down by a\npact of conservatives, libertarians and\nthe health insurance industry. And so\nthe grim fact remains; the USA is the\nonly wealthy industrialised nation that\ndoes not provide universal health care.\nThey are in a blinkered minority in believing that health care is a service, and\nnot a fundamental human right (out-side the realm of one\u2019s ability to pay).\nNathanLey\nNathanLey Science Editor\nBe grateful for the \u2018Death Panels\u2019\nThe welfare state may be under attack, but the method and philosophy remains by far the fairest option\nHere, respondents are asked to\nchoose between either remaining\nin a state of ill health for a period\nof time, or being restored to perfect health but having a shorter life\nexpectancy.\nRespondants are asked to rate a\nstate of ill health on a scale from 0 to\n100, with 0 representing death and\n100 representing a state of perfect\nhealth. This method has the advantage of being the easiest to ask, but\nit is the most subjective. It can be\nconsidered as similar to other linear\nscales such as the Borg scale\nIn this method, respondents are\nasked to choose between remaining in a state of ill health for a period of time, or choosing a medical\nintervention which has a chance\nof either restoring them to perfect\nhealth, or killing them\nTime-trade-off (TTO) Visual analogue scale (VAS) Standard gamble (SG)\nConsequently, they at present have a\nsociety in which health insurance is\navailable to the highest bidder subject\nto the harsh conditions presented by\nmarket forces. All this results in a nation in which medical debt is the highest cause of personal bankruptcy.\nAs recently as last week Florida\nDemocrat Alan Grayson accused republicans of obstructing health care\nreform as \u201cfoot-dragging, knuckle-dragging Neanderthals\u201d. And you can\nsee his point. He based his opinions\non a Harvard study which concluded\nthat the US health care crisis is costing\n44,000 lives a year. All this in the most\npowerful country on earth? I\u2019ll take\ndeath panels any day.\nThe USA will continue to stick to\ntheir ways so long as scaremongering\nand demonisation remain effective political tools. Whilst the UK will continue to provide treatment and approve\neffective and cost-effective drugs in\naccordance with democratic scientific\njudgement in a way which does not\nhinge on how much cash someone has\nsat in their kitty. NICE is entirely necessary and continues to perform a fair\nand proper role in our society.\nA new publishing company was\nlaunched in London last month.\nMediKidz started originally in New\nZealand in 2006, but has now they aim\nfor global business to produce comic\nbooks about as many medical conditions as possible.\nTwo medical doctors Dr Kate Hersov and Dr Kim Chilman-Blair realized\nthere was hardly any child-friendly\ninformation about illnesses that affect children all over the world. Affected children are left to their own\ndevices. Their families are left with\nthe burden of explaining the medical\nissues surrounding their condition.\n\u201cThere is no medical information for\nkids\u201d Chilman-Blair told Felix. \u201cOften\nwhen we made a diagnosis of a young\nchild we felt helpless that we had nothing to give the child themselves to understand what we had just told them,\u201d\nHersov told the BBC.\nSo, the two doctors decided to start a\nseries of comic books that would eventually cover up to 300 most common\npaediatric conditions, including conditions such as asthma, leukemia, HIV\nand diabetes. They already have 26 titles in stock, and several UK hospitals\nordered copies as well a national catering company that is going to distribute\ncomic books about obesity in schools\naround the country.\nThe comic book series features superhero team called MediKidz. They\nlive on a planet that is shaped like a\nhuman body, the MediLand. Each\ncharacter has super powers related to\ncertain part of the body, such as Chi,\nan expert in lungs, or Axon, a brain\nspecialist. In each comic book they\ntake a child character on an exciting\ntour of Mediland, explaining along the\nway the disease the child suffers from,\nwhat caused it and how it can be diagnosed and treated. So each comics\nbook is like a package of information\nexplaining both the science behind the\ndisease and the issues that patients will\nencounter such as medical procedures\nand medication they will have to take.\nImportantly the scientific information\nis delivered in an engaging and humorous way, through visually appealing\ncomic books.\n\u201cComic books appeal to kids across\nthe board\u201d Chilman-Blair told Felix\nin an interview, \u201cThey appeal to both\nboys and girls, and even parents can\nlearn from them. We would like our\ncomics to become a one-stop-shop for\nall medical issues.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time anyone came\nup with the idea of using comics to\ndeliver scientific or medical informa-tion. Comics have also been used in\nhealth promotion and to help children\ncope with the psychological impact of\ndiseases including cancer and diabe-tes, examples include Captain Chemo\ncomics and Omega Boy vs Dr. Diabetes. Some of these have actually been\ndrawn and conceived by the children\npatients themselves, perhaps showing\nthe need and inclination of children\nfor such materials in a comic book\nmedium. The comic books can be\npurchased from their website (www.\nmedikidz.com) for \u00a35.99 each, and\npart of the cost is contributed to the\ncharity MediKidz Foundation, which\naims to help educate children in the\ndeveloping countries and deliver this\ninformation to them for free. The comics are good value for money, in this reviewer\u2019s opinion. They explain quite a\nbit of science in the 32 pages, and the\nnarrative is actually very engaging. If\nyou don\u2019t want to cash out for comics but still want to support MediKidz\u2019\ncharitable aims, you can join them on\nFacebook and Twitter.\nMediKidz: Superheroes explain medicine to children\nMicoTatalovic\nMicoTatalovic Science Reporter\nSkinderella is one of six superheroes\nmaking understanding medicine easy\n\n"

Here, the\nsun is shining, and academic enslavement awaits.\nAs for the rest of you, down your\npint fresher.\nHopefully many of you would\u2019ve\nhad the blessings of St Christopher\nand done a decent amount of trav-elling; I certainly have myself. Even\nnow as I speak, I\u2019m in my bed of a\nguesthouse in Port Vila, Vanuatu,\nwhere the owner, upon deciding\nI\u2019ve done a runner without pay-ment, has detained all of my be-longings. Fun times.\nAs I recline in bed waiting for\nthe key holders, festering heat and\nbarking dogs in as backdrop, I began musing on the inevitable: in no\ntime my journey would come to an\nend, and I\u2019ll be back in the lecture\nroom feigning concentration.\nI may be on holiday daydreaming\nabout reality, though in a month\u2019s\ntime it\u2019ll be no doubt the other way\nround.\nBut why not daydream? After all,\ntravel-related ambitions sprout\nfrom the absent-minded moments\ndon\u2019t they? Give yourself plenty of\ntime to make preparations and wait\nfor the inspiration to click. Who\nknows where your next adventure\ntakes you?\nAnd to help you dreamers out, I\u2019m\ngoing to do my best as travel editor\nto relieve your Friday-afternoon\nblues. Two terms of experimentation and a great deal of thinking\nlater, allow me to introduce some\nof the new features and improvements to the existing format.\nThe main feature continues to\ndeliver colourful accounts of epic\nlocations, breathtaking sceneries\nand personal thoughts, all written\nby members and friends of Imperial College. The coming year will\nsee many more guest writers sharing their experiences; those fed up\nwith reading about my Morocco\nhitch, rejoice.\nThe editorial will address many\nmore travel-related issues, whether it was something I\u2019ve stumbled\nacross during my travels or my al-cohol/kava-fuelled conversations.\nThere will be several new additions gracing the travel section.\n\u2018Postcards from afar\u2019 will have\nreaders sending in postcards or\nphotographs from their foreign\nventures, with an attached story to\ntell of the place or encounter. For\nmore details see the column below.\n\u2018Interview with the extraordinaire\u2019 will feature interviews I\u2019ve\nconducted with legendary figures\nin the world of travel. To begin\nwith, my interview with Ben Keene,\nco-founder of Tribewanted (http://\nwww.tribewanted.com), will be\npublished shortly alongside a feature article on the project \u2012 stay\ntuned for that one.\nIn the meantime, stop lamenting\nthat your holiday was over \u2012 instead why not look forward to the\nvacations yet to come? With some\npositive thinking and a bit of help\nhere from the travel department,\nperhaps reality isn\u2019t that grim after all.\n* * *\nFor more of my travel anecdotes,\nfollow me on twitter @travelinge-ditor.

Junior\u2019s silhouette grew to intimidate me a little\n\u2013 the adrenaline was there pumped\nthrough the veins.\nThat instant, I had a taster of the\nsense of adventure my predecessors\nwould have experienced when they\ncame to visit the same island, the\nsame forests and same hospitality.\nAnd with the increasing convenience in air-conditioned coaches,\nbusiness-class airport lounges,\ntop-speed catamarans and five-star hotels, the entire market is almost exclusively catered for luxury\nseekers, and less inclined to serve\nthe intrepid adventurers the thrill\nthey seek.\nBut then, they had little reliance\non what was an almost inexistent\ntourist industry.\nOur generation has been pampered with so much comfort and\nconvenience that, at first oppor-tunity, we cling onto what deemed\n\u2018safe\u2019 more so than our counterparts three decades ago, even\nwithout us knowing. As much as I\nwould love to condemn the tourism industry for ruining my ideal\nadventure, I must admit: am I capable of shredding my Lonely Planet,\nditching STA Travel, embracing\n100% local diet and rambling into\nthe sunset on local transport?\nLet\u2019s be realistic. The answer\nis no. And hands off my amazing\nLonely Planet collection.\n*\nIt has been at least two weeks since\nwinding up in bed, feeling merry,\nafter a pensive evening \u2013 apparently the other guests settled for an\nuneventful early-night. It may have\nbeen an archipelago of close prox-imity, Vanuatu possesses a distinctive culture that not only starkly\ndiffers from that of Fiji, but also\nvaries from island to island.\nBesides that, I treat Vanuatu with\naffection as a less-developed substitute of the Fiji I had previously fallen\nin love with.\nAnd by less developed I meant dusty\nguesthouses, canned tuna and corned\nbeef for lunch, and dinner, gas lamps\nfor staggering back to the bungalow\nunder the guidance of a visible Milky\nWay. Rowdy tourists found a spot in\nmy distant memory. Dirt tracks were\na norm, mini trucks a must. No seat-belts? Just cling on tighter, and enjoy\nthe ride.\nMy thrill-seeking inner self was\nsatisfied.\nTurning to Kelson, my guide and\nfellow bird hunter, I accepted a glass\nof water infused with lemon leaves.\nWe chatted under the stars.\nGetting along with local cannibals...err...friendly tribesmen\nBut then, what the hell is kava?\n*Clap, Bula...*gulp gulp gulp..*clap *clap *clap...hmmmm, mucky water\nI\nf someone has recently returned from Fiji or Vanuatu,\nand told you that kava is\nmuddy water that taste like\npiss, do me a favour \u2013 tell\nhim/her to get a palate transplant.\nPreferably swap brains too.\nFor heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t be misled\ninto hating it automatically.\nKava, or yaqona, or grog in Fijian slang, is a type of pepper plant\n(Piper methysticum, for you botany\nfanatics out there) found in the\nwestern Pacific. Only the roots of\nthe plant is used in the actual preparation of the drink.\nKava roots are generally pounded\ninto powdered form \u2013 islanders in\nVanuatu are known to chew the\npotent root.

But did I want to contribute in\ndestroying their cultural concept of\nunconditional sharing?\nBesides, I was disgusted to hear\nabout what the Americans were\ndoing.\nIt did get me thinking, wouldn\u2019t this\nbe what an older generation of Fijians\n\u2013 think twenty years ago \u2013 have un-dergone, the same wind of change?\nBefore they could resist the temptation to drift away from tradition \u2013 I\nhave met many money-orientated\nni-Vans \u2013 their surroundings would\nhave been \u2018upgraded\u2019 to suit our\nneeds, and them having to adapt according to our needs. The world is\nindeed changing.\nAt least I got a glimpse of a time\nportal before the storm strikes.\nresembles muddy water.\nThe effects of kava includes\nnumbing of the tongue and lips,\ngeneral relaxation and, as a narcot-ic, sensations that resemble effects\nof alcoholism.\nIt also apparently combats stress,\ninsomnia, anxiety and helps lowering chloesterol levels.\nIn Fiji the concept of kava-drink-ing is firmly cemented to the strict\ncodes of tribal culture. While a\ntabua (smelly whale tooth) is presented at occasions of business\nconducts, kava roots symbolises\ngoodwill and are presented as you\nvisit a village, making request for\nmarriage, or as a gesture of gratitude or apology.\nWhile little etiquettes are imposed when drinking kava in other\nMelanesian and Polynesian cul-tures, Fijians give a resonant clap,\nchanting bula (cheers) before accepting the bilo, usually a cup made\nfrom a coconut shell, and knock the\nbitter drink down in one go. It is\nthen finished with three claps as a\ngesture of gratitude to the server.\nYou can control the quantity of\ngrog by uttering a specific, novelty\nphrase to the server. This ranges\nfrom low-tide to high-tide, followed by tsnami. My memory tells\nme \u2013 albeit not vividly \u2013 that I have\nonce accepted an \u2018ambulance bus\u2019.\nFor obvious reasons, I can\u2019t remember\nmuch of the evening.\nSo you like staggering out of a kava\nbar not able to walk in a straight line,\ndrowsily giddy with the sweetest grin\nacross the face?

And\nas the UK government\nstruggles to plug the growing state\ndebt, student financing has been\ntopping recent agendas. From politics to commerce, funding for past,\ncurrent and future students has been\na headline topic over the summer.\n1. In a report from the Confederation of British Industry, an organisation of 100,000 members representing\nbusiness interests in Britain, tuition\nfees were held up as a potential area for\ngovernment savings. It recommended\nthat money be saved from the support system in place, and that students\nshould come to see above-inflation\nincreases in fees as \u2018inevitable\u2019. It also\nrecommended that the government\nshould scrap its target of 50% of school\nleavers entering university, a proposal\nthat was immediately dismissed by\nthe Higher Education minister for\nEngland.\nThe National Union of Students hit\nout at the CBI\u2019s report, describing its\nrecommendations as a \u2018gross hypocrisy\u2019. The report also encouraged businesses to provide more sponsorships\nfor students.\n2. At the Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth, party leader\nNick Clegg outlined plans to put on\nhold the party\u2019s long-standing opposition to tuition fees. He stated that the\nparty should be \u2018realistic\u2019 about what\nthe country could afford over the next\nfew years.\nBelieving the scrapping of the fees a\nOld BBC Wood Lane site bought out by Imperial College for new campus\nImperial expanded its London campuses by seven acres over the summer,\nwith the acquisition of a site, currently\nowned by the BBC, on Wood Lane.\nThe Woodlands site will mainly be\nused for postgraduates and research-ers, with the possibility of providing\nhousing for postgraduate students as\nwell as gym facilities and a cr\u00e8che.\nIn a letter to staff, Chief Operating\nOfficer for Imperial College, Dr Martin Knight, justified the purchase of the\nnew campus, stating: \u201cThanks to the\nCollege\u2019s continuing success, our activities have expanded, and demand for\nteaching, research and administration\nspace has grown to the point where\nour existing campuses in west London\nhave become increasingly congested.\nFurther development of our academic\nactivities means we require room to\nexpand, and the chance to acquire over\nseven acres of freehold land and 25,000\nsq metres of buildings in such a location in west London, close to our existing campuses, was a rare opportunity\nthat was too promising to miss.\nDr Knight made suggestions as to\nthe use of the new campus: \u201cAt a time\nwhen there is significant and growing\ndemand for the education that Imperial offers, it will allow us to build quality,\ntailored accommodation for students,\nparticularly to meet the significant\nrising need among postgraduate stu-dents. Currently we provide only 330\nCollege bed spaces for a community of\n4,500 postgraduates.\u201d\nAccording to the BBC website, the\nWoodlands site was originally developed in 1981, as a base for BBC Enterprises, which evolved into BBC Worldwide, the BBC\u2019s commercial subsidiary.\nThe site has also housed Studio Capital\nProjects, who were responsible for the\nmajor capital expenditure required to\ndevelop the BBC\u2019s studio infrastruc-ture. BBC Worldwide were housed at\nthe Woodlands site until September\n2008, when they were moved to the\nnearby Media Village.\nPaul Anastasiasis, a post graduate\nstudent based at the Hammersmith\ncampus, disagrees with this use of college money and the need for more post\ngraduate accomodation. He told felix:\n\u201cI think that given the pending large\nstaff cuts in the Faculty of Medicine\nthe money would be better spent fund-AliceRowlands\nAliceRowlands News Reporter\nImperial students who have\nnot yet received their final\nnotification of entitlement\nhave been encouraged by the\nCollege to bring with them\na copy of their completed\napplication form.\nAnyone who cannot yet pay for\naccommodation without their\nloan should contact Jasmin\nWills of the Student Finance\ndepartment at jasmin.wills@\nimperial.ac.uk quoting their\nCollege Identifier Number.\nHere with no money?\n1. 4.\nChristopher Woolley runs through a summer of financial disarray and debate for students new and old\n2.\n3.\ncentral element of Lib Dem policy, the\nparty\u2019s federal policy committee voted\n14 to 5 to keep the pledge in their upcoming election manifesto. The Conservative and Labour parties have not\nruled out future fee increases.\n3. A backlog of new and continuing\nstudent finance applications has built\nup at the Student Loans Company,\nleaving nearly 170,000 without their\nfinal notification of loan entitlement.\nThe company has reported a 16% rise\nin applications as more people opt for\nuniversity over the struggle to find permanent employment.\nMany returning students are also\ntaking out loans for the first time to\ncover financial hardship, having been\nable to fund their studies previously.\nThe chief executive of the SLC has\napologised to those without funding,\nand admitted that their phone systems\nhad effectively ground to a halt.\n4. Lord Sutherland has called for the\nre-introduction of tuition fees in\nScotland. The former Vice-Chancellor of the University of London and\nformer Principle of Edinburgh University proposed that money from students from higher income households\nwould cover the cost of supporting\nthose from lower income households.\nThe ruling Scottish National Party\npledged not to bring back the fees in\ntheir 2007 manifesto. Tuition fees were\nabolished in 2000 by the then Labour\n& Liberal Democrat coalition government of Scotland.\n5. The government opted not to set\nan interest rate on student loans this\nyear, effectively making it 0%. The interest rate is normally set to match\nthe retail price index (RPI) inflation\nmeasure of last March, or the Bank of\nEngland\u2019s base interest rate plus 1%,\ndepending on which is lower.\nAs the RPI has faltered through the\nrecession the rate should have been\nminus 0.4%. The Bank of England is\nkeeping a close eye on inflation, and\nlooks likely to keep the base rate at a\nhistoric low of 0.5% for some time as\nthe G20 leaders predict a slow economic recovery over the next decade.\n5.\nWhat\u2019s your story?\nHow badly have you been\naffected by the SLC\u2019s backlog?\nfelix wants to hear about your\nstudent loan nightmares for an\nin-depth feature next week.\nIf you would like to share\nyour experiences in regards\nto acquiring the loan you\nregistered for, drop us an email\nat felix@imperial.ac.uk. We\u2019ll\nget back to you as quickly as\npossible.\ning the excellent research associated\nwith Imperial and which will provide\npost graduate students much better career oportunities. However if the profit\nmade from the halls is re-invested in\nresearch then in the long term it could\nbe a good idea.\u201d\nThe expansion of west London cam-pues comes amid on going suggestion\nthat the Wye campus may be cut. felix\nwonders whether a new development\nis necessary while college still dithers over the neccessity of our country\ncampus.\nUndergraduates are unlikely to notice much change due to the new\ncampus, though many will be pleased\nabout having fewer sweaty postgrads\ncycling in from Ealing. Many South\nKen based students have been left pondering what better use could be made\nof \u00a328 million. Members of the ACC\nmay be interested to note this equates\nto over 18 million pints of snakebite,\nwhich would be enough beers to run\nan ACC bar night every Wednesday\nfor the next 60 years. College could\nbuy every student at Imperial a swanky\nnew MacBook for less money, or the\nmoney could be used to rent a floor of\nthe new Eastside Halls for two weeks.\n\n"

In between weeks\ntouring The Alps, the committee managed to put together a pre-term, pre-freshers-arrival trip, from the 18th-20th September.\nAs a reader who is statistically unlikely to be a member of the Outdoor\nClub, you won\u2019t know that every term\nwe organise weekend trips away to various hot (cold), sunny (rainy) regions of\nthe country, roughly every two weeks,\nto do outdoors-y type stuff.\nOur destination this time: Ogwen\nValley, Snowdonia National Park\n(Wales). Our first port of call was Birmingham, not for the nightlife believe\nit or not, but to pick up the club\u2019s very\nown ex-professional jobseeker Neil,\nand for dinner at Big John\u2019s - the home\nof, amongst every other fast food im-aginable, the 20 inch pizza.\nAfter clearing immigration at the\nEnglish/Welsh border in record time\nwe pushed on to the campsite arriving\nshortly after 1am, rapidly establishing\nour base camp.\nWith the promise of good weather Jonny and Robin set off to climb\nthe classic mountaineering route of\nGrooved Ar\u00eate on the East Face of Tryfan - 560 feet of Very Difficult climb-ing. Equally motivated Benn got his\nbike out and headed off at 10:30am\nfor the Marin trail, a 25km Red grade\nmountain biking route, with steep inclines and ridiculous single track, full\nof logs, rocks, jumps, technical descents and intense climbs. Recognised\nas a 2-4 hour ride, he impressively\nfinished in 2hours 5mins. After lunch\nand some stretching he descended\nupon the 22km Penmachno. Half\nway through he needed a break, but\nfinished in under 3 hours. Benn described it as \u201c[an] excellent ride, more\nchallenging in sections than Marin,\nbut not as \u2018complete\u2019 a ride.\u201d Having recently entered myself into a mountain\nmarathon, I decided a training run was\nneeded. Phil joined me and we put together a route that would take us from\nthe campsite around Llyn(lake, I think)\nOgwen over the summits of Y Garn\n(947m) and Foel Goch (831m) and\ndown to the town of Llanberis in the\nnext valley. After a gruelling two-and-a-half hours, we spent the rest of the\nafternoon \u2018recovering\u2019 in Pete\u2019s Eats, a\nfamous climber\u2019s caf\u00e9 where the tea is\nserved in pints!\nMeanwhile, Neil and Boris were\nbusy making an impressive ascent of\nthe worryinly named \u2018Cemetery Gates\u2019\nat E1 5b. That evening, we cooked\nup our club special: chilli con carne.\nWhen the rain started we were forced\ninto our luxury 10 men tent and spent\nthe evening drinking our beers, while\nthe conversation took some\u2026erm\u2026\ninteresting\u2026turns. Fortunately for all\na mildly intoxicated Chef Rob busied\nhimself turning out pots of sainsbury\u2019s\nbasics Angel Delight.\nDay two came, and I soon discovered\nthat we hadn\u2019t brought any club rock-shoes (see, this is why we need a dry\nrun). I don\u2019t actually own any of my\nown climbing gear, I just borrow everything from the clubs vast stores, so\nit was looking like I\u2019d be out running\nagain. Being completely knackered\nfrom the previous day\u2019s run, I decided\nto go for a walk instead, and because I\ncouldn\u2019t be bothered to do any naviga-tion, I just followed the same route as\nthe day before, with the hope of taking in some scenery this time. There\nwere thankfully no major incidents,\nbut at one point I found myself looking for a footpath which didn\u2019t seem\nto exist, which led to me wasting a\nhour wandering round a hillside, after which I ended up running to make\nup some lost time. Benn was back out\non the bike, in the morning he went\nslate mountain-biking describing it as\n\u201cextremely difficult descents on loose\nslate. Sharp edges and very unforgiving riding made for a difficult but enjoyable morning.\u201d He then spent the\nafternoon making new tracks on various mountains, but by 5pm had found\nhimself lost in a valley, with no mobile reception. He called back to base\ncamp via a landline and was picked up\naround nightfall (\u2018thanks guys\u2019 - Benn).\nJonny and Robin headed up the first\ntwo pitches of the \u2018Direct route\u2019 on\nDinas Mot, but progressed with an accidental traverse over to \u2018the cracks\u2019,\n\u201cwhich we unfortunately had to finish,\u201d\nsaid Jonny. Must have been hard. It\nprobably wasn\u2019t made any easier by the\nmassive shit encountered on pitch 3.\nYes, human, yes fresh. Nice. They finished the day on Cromlech boulders.\nLocal boy Sam joined Neil and Boris\non day two for some good climbs in the\nLlanberis slate quarries. Boris and Sam\nboth lead their hardest routes to date;\nBoris on Gnat Attack (E1 5b) and Sam\non Fool\u2019s Gold (E1 5c). Boris also lead\nLooning the Tube (E1 5a). What Neil\ndid remains a mystery to me! Probably\ndossing at the bottom of the crag eating\nbiscuits! (joking! (or am I?)). Keen not\nto be outdone by Neil and Boris, Rob\nand James went off to climb Cemetery\nGates, and succeeded! Phil and Pavlo\ndid their turn on Grooved Ar\u00eate, but\nfound themselves stuck behind 3 par-ties. They completed the route by 7.30,\njust as it started to get dark, but were\nable to make an epic head-torch assisted descent of Tryfans North Ridge in\njust 55 minutes. With everyone on the\nbus we made it across the border and\nback to civilisation (Birmingham?), for\nour customary Big John\u2019s dinner.\nOur bus full of outdoorists finally\nmade it back to Beit, content, if a little\nlater than planned!\nGet involved! Details of our trips\ncan be found at http://union.\nic.ac.uk/outdoor Thanks to Phil\nLeadbeater and Jonny Phillips for\ntheir contributions The Outdoor Club look remarkably happy despite being stuck in Wales\nJustin Whitehouse heads to Wales, and does a dry run with the Outdoor Club in preparation for the new year\nH.G.

Yes, that is a Lamborghini garage\ndown the road and yes, those women\nwalking up and down Cromwell Road\nare wearing the equivalent of a small\nfortune. However, with every upside\ncomes a downside and though it\u2019s not\nexactly cataclysmic in comparison to\nthe relative benefits offered, there is a\ndownside to being at a college so sin-gle-minded in its pursuit of scientific\nand technological nirvana.\nAnd if you\u2019re the artsy type or to any\ndegree that way inclined, you\u2019re sure\nto feel it. Not in a tortuous and quite\nunnecessarily gratuitous fashion such\nas, say, something you would see in the\nSaw series or even any film containing\nJason Schwartzman. The relative quiet\nof the College\u2019s arts scene and lack of\ndiversity in the general student populace is understandable given its focus\non science, but those of you who loved\nyour arts subjects at school may find\nthat part of yourselves undernourished\nas time passes.

If you are a returning reader, hang in there,\nit will soon be over. Those who\nlike to keep up with business and finance news but could not be bothered\nto read over the summer are in luck.\nThis section will offer the laziest way\ncurrently available to sound like you\nknow what you are talking about. We\nalso throw in some right-wing rants for\ngood measure. Feel free to email me if\nyou disagree with our analysis or wish\nto write for felix Business.\nfelix reviews the first prolonged period of few surprises and\nrelative normality since the start of the financial crises\nSince the recent triumph of the DPJ in\nthe Japanese elections, we have been\ngetting some rather mixed messages.\nThe main reason for this is that the DPJ\nhave needed a coalition with the PNP\nof Shizuka Kamei to hold a majority in\nthe upper house. Mr Kamei\u2019s views are\nat odds with the DPJ leadership\u2019s willingness to embrace the free markets as\na means of returning dynamism to the\nJapanese economy.\nThe DPJ has been insistant that the\ngovernment should interfere less in the\nforeign exchange markets than it has\ndone in the past. But it must contend\nwith Japanese exporters, hit hard by\nthe recent recession, who are lobbying\nstrongly for a weaker Yen. Meanwhile\nthe PNP has been demanding government write-offs of bad consumer debt\nand opposing privatisation plans.\nThe result of all this has been a\nnumber of mixed statements that have\nmoved the markets substantially in different directions in recent weeks. The\nmost likely outcome will be short term\nmoves to appease the exporters alongside longer-term plans to allow the Yen\nto float more freely. Expect to see less\nsensitivity to such comments in future.\nSinaAtaherian\nSinaAtaherian Business Editor\nO\nn September 25th HR1207,\na bill that will remove key\nrestrictions on the Government Accountability\nOffice\u2019s ability to audit the Federal Reserve got its first full hearing in the\nHouse Committee on Financial Services. Lifelong anti-Fed campaigner Dr\nRon Paul, Republican of Texas, is the\nBill\u2019s sponsor. He believes it will help\nstop the Fed\u2019s ability to fund large government programmes such as wars\nand will make its manipulation of the\ncurrency more difficult.\nThe Bill has bipartisan support with\nover two thirds of the House signed on\nas co-sponsors, as well 80% of American voters according to the latest polls.\nThere nonetheless remain serious\nchallenges from the likes of Congressman Mel Watt. He who drew the committee\u2019s attention to a recent open letter by economists arguing against the\nlegislation, published in the WSJ. \u201cIt\nwas signed by about eighty academic\nintellectual err academic type people\nso yeah\u201d he added.\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve has\nbeen attempting to alleviate some of\nI\u2019m Confused\nG20 Meet in Pittsburgh\nT\nhe recent financial crisis\nwas particularly difficult for\nits supposed culprits \u2013 subprime borrowers in America. They are typically poor, heavily\nindebted and unable to purchase basic\nnecessities such as cars. Meanwhile,\nin its attempts to save the economy\nfrom its debt and over-consumption\nproblems, the US government has expanded its debt to almost $6 trillion in\norder to stimulate consumption.\nA small but illuminating way to deal\nwith such problems was up and running by August. \u2018Cash for Clunkers\u2019\ninvolves the government handing out\n$4500 of borrowed money to Americans to destroy their cheaper cars \u2013\nthe sort poor people would otherwise\nClunkers for Policy-Makers\nAudit the Fed\nFree Drugs\nhave been able to afford on the second\nhand market. They must then use this\nmoney, probably alongside additional\npersonal loans, to buy newer cars.\nThese are themselves built at a loss\nto the American taxpayer who is currently subsidising their manufacturers.\nAlongside the trillions spent (or at\nleast appropriated for spending) here\nand there, this may seem small pick-ings. The scheme was declared a huge\nsuccess for exhausting its initial $3 billion budget, for instance. But the larger\nsignificance is the insight it gives investors into the thinking of the current\nadministration. During the depression\nthey destroyed food and farmland. Investors could have been forgiven for\nthinking they would have learned their\nlesson by now. It would appear they\nstill need a little more time.\nT\nhe main outcome of September\u2019s gathering of the world\u2019s\nnineteen supposedly-most-influential governments plus\nthe EU was a general agreement to give\nmore say to developing nations.\nFor example, it was decided that the\ngroup should replace the G8 as the\nmain forum for more important states\nto move on global policy faster than\nthe UN would be able to. The consensus comes after growing sentiments\nthat the lender-borrower relationship\nnow consolidated between poor and\nrich countries should be more even.\nThere was some scepticism on this\ndue to the tone of much of the conversation and the limited change in voting rights. This consisted of pledges\nto transfer 5% of IMF voting shares\nfrom over-represented nations (such\nas Belgium that gets more votes than\nBrazil) to emerging economies, and a\nsimilar transfer involving 3% of World\nBank shares. The meeting also covered\npolicy areas considered more effectively tackled with global co-operation.\nFree trade and climate change took a\nback seat to the hotter populist topics of banker pay and global financial\nregulation.\nConcerns over high banking sector\npay have some justification given the\ntaxpayer bailouts earlier in the year. It\nis particularly difficult for the bailed\nout banks to make the argument that\ncaps on bonuses may lead their most\ntalented to leave, since their talents are\nnow in serious question.\nThis development should not, how-ever, concern prospective entrants\ninto the sector. London\u2019s usurpation\nof New York\u2019s seat as financial capital\nof the world amply demonstrated the\nindustry\u2019s sensitivity to interference\nand the lightness of its feet. That the\nlesson was not lost on the French and\nGermans explains their otherwise dubious advice to London about the need\nfor tougher curbs.\nOn the broader issue of financial regulation the world was also saved from\nthe G20\u2019s deluded thinking only by the\nweakness of its will. Having given tactical business advice and suggestions\nof deferred bonuses to better capture\nlonger-term systemic risks to banking executives, the delegates moved\non to proposals for centrally-planned\nfinance. Even the Pope took a break\nfrom the Vatican\u2019s traditional support\nfor private property to endorse global\nfinancial regulation in his encyclical,\nCaritas in Veritate, published July 7th.\nThey should have been able to agree\non substantial changes given how\nmainstream their cause has become.\nThey largely failed.\nShizuka Kamei of the PNP\nthe concern surrounding the nature\nof its operations. Senior staff led by no\nless than Bernanke himself have been\ntouring the country promoting the case\nfor Fed secrecy in order for it to \u2018stay\nindependent\u2019. In the process they have\nalready made available new informa-tion. Even strong allies such as former\nNew York Fed President Tim Geithner\nand House Financial Services Comittee Chair Barney Frank have suggested\nthat some sort of relaxation on GAO\naudit restrictions may be benefitial. A\nFederal Judge recently found in favour\nof a Freedom of Information Act request by Bloomberg News of the Fed\u2019s\nbooks. Given the global significance of\nthe Federal Reserve System, this will be\nan important space to watch.\nT\nhe democrats have spent the\nbest part of the year so far\ntrying to make healthcare\ncheaper and more accessible to uninsured people in America.\nEstimates of the bill for the Bill range\nfrom self-funding to about three trillion dollars. Congressional democrats\nhave spent the summer trying to sell\nthe plans to increasingly hostile voters\nat town hall meetings. The protestors\nat such meetings have in turn been\ngetting more vocal about their objections to the increased involvement of\na demonstrably incompetent government in an extremely sensitive area of\ntheir until-now-private lives.\nThey point out that of the forty-five\nmillion people with no health insur-ance, eleven million are prevented\nfrom purchasing any because they\nare illegal immigrants. Fifteen million\nearn more than the average American but feel insurance is bad value for\nmoney as current regulations force\nthem to subsidise the less healthy.\nAnother sixteen million are already\neligible for Medicaid, which specifically covers the poor, but choose not\nto fill out the forms largely because it is\neasier to be treated on demand for free\nin emergency wards if needed.\nIf you believe the polls, most Americans view the main problem as not\naccess but cost. In the past decade,\nhealthcare inflation has consistently\nbeen three times the overall figure.\nToday America spends 16% of its GDP\non health. This is a greater proportion than any other developed nation\nand twice the OECD average. The lesson from the freer parts of the sector,\nnamely dentistry and optometry, are\nclear.\nAt present state governments only\nallow providers based in the state to\noffer insurance. So far federal authorities have not attempted to enforce the\ninter-state commerce clause, which\nwould increase competeion in the insurance sector and drive down prices.\nThe other major problem causing higher prices is severe limits on the ability\nof healthcare providers to compete on\nprice because of discrimination laws\nas well as the single-price bargaining\npractice of Medicaid and Medicare.\nOh, don\u2019t slip now. Oh wait. I already did. Is that meant to be in two pieces?\n\n"

This\nyear will see a general\nelection, most likely in May, in which\nthe Conservative party will almost certainly win. The only real question is-by how much?\nRecent polling data from YouGov\nshow the Conservatives to have a 14%\nlead over Labour in the popular vote,\nwhich would correspond to an overall\nmajority of 70, or 360 seats for the Tories, 199 for Labour and 55 for the Lib\nDems. This of course far from guarantees a Tory win, polling data in the UK\noften proves inaccurate, if only because\nwe are still so far away from the election date and so much could happen\nbetween now and May.\nSo why have the Conservatives taken\nsuch a lead? As is too often the case in\npolitics, people aren\u2019t thinking of voting\nConservative because they particularly\nlike them, but because they no longer\napprove of Labour. Since 1997, Labour\nhave taken the country into 2 unpopular wars, put the country in the worst\neconomic position to recover from the\nglobal recession and encroached on civil liberties. On top of this, popular sentiment appears to be of the opinion that\nLabour has had long enough to enact\nthe changes which they had promised\n12 years ago.\nSo as we come up to the general elec-tion, what promises will the parties\nmake, and will it matter? The number\nof people who will read the 3 main parties manifestoes will be negligible in\nproportion to the number that vote, and\nas such the vote, if it were to be close, is\nlikely to be decided by the charisma of\nthe leaders and the slogans of the party,\nrather than from any detailed inspection of their policies.\nAssuming the election is in May, the\nparties still have over half a year in\nwhich to persuade the electorate to vote\nfor them, and as such it is still quite early\nfor anyone to lay down grand plans for\ngovernment. However, the past 3 weeks\nhave seen the main parties\u2019 political\nconferences and they have been fairly\ntelling. Labour spent their conference\naddressing themselves in an attempt to\nunite the party, though this meant an\nabsence of reaching out to the country.\nThe Lib Dem conference main highlight was watching Nick Clegg distance\nhimself from the party by going against\none of their long held ideals- that there\nshould be no tuition fees.\nTuition fees being a matter important\nto students, and by pointing out that\nthe Lib Dems might have to keep tuition fees if it proved \u2018too expensive\u2019 to\nscrap them, they are sure to lose student\nvotes. The so called \u2018Mansion Tax\u2019 on\nhomes worth over \u00a31m also didn\u2019t meet\nwith much approval amongst the party.\nThe Conservative conference saw the\nsigns of a rift in the party about Europe\nand the potential for a referendum on\nthe Lisbon treaty.\nThe Tories are aware that they have\nnot won yet, and the main message to\nthe party has been to not be complacent\nof victory, but to truly win over the people and secure a \u2018\u201cstrong and positive\nmandate\u201d for the bold plans to revive\nthe economy. These would include tax\ncuts for new businesses and assessing\neveryone on disability allowance for\ntheir ability to work.\nStill, almost an entire year of university waits before the general election is\nlikely to occur and lots could happen in\nthat time, though it does seem that a\nmiracle would be needed for Labour to\nhold their majority. Who knows, maybe\nGordon Brown will show us his charismatic competent side which he has\nmanaged to hide so very well. Or maybe\nCameron will turn out to be a pimp.\nJamesLees\nJamesLees Politics Editor\nThe most important question in politics today: Dominic Grieve MP, hot or not?\nFixing Broken Britain?\nThis week is the Conservative\nParty Conference, held in Manchester. Wednesday\u2019s main theme was\n\u201cfixing broken Britain\u201d. A number of\nissues were being addressed, including schooling, sport, and welfare re-form, but I want to look at proposals\nby Shadow Justice Secretary Dominic\nGrieve MP, that will enable the disclosure of offenders\u2019 identities to the\npublic. Woah! alarm bells are ringing in my head already. I\u2019m thinking\nof the words \u2018vigilante\u2019, \u2018lynchings\u2019 and\n\u2018revenge\u2019.\nThis is supposedly to aid crime prevention and public safety. I believe\nthis will, in fact, do the opposite. Releasing the details of offenders will, I\nthink, lead to revenge attacks, possibly against innocent members of the\npublic.\nPicture this: a kid\u2019s bike is stolen.\nKid tells Dad. Dad \u2018googles\u2019 local of-fenders, and finds a man living 3\nstreets away, who, as a teenager, stole\na bike. \u201cHey! It\u2019s him!\u201d One drunken\nnight, Dad and mates go to this guy\u2019s\nhouse, who made a mistake years ago,\nand hence forth, hospitalise him. Dad\nand mates go to prison. And the kid\nstill doesn\u2019t have his bike back! Now,\nthis may seem far-fetched, but it could\nhappen!\nI think that just because you are,\nin the eyes of the law, an \u2018offender\u2019,\ndoesn\u2019t give the government the right\nto tell all who you are, especially when\nmany crimes are mistakes from a past\nlife. Many criminals are reformed, and\nshould be able to continue with their\nlives. Imagine if you had a criminal\nrecord, and you were then put in a database for all to see. Would you be OK\nwith this?\nNow, you may be wondering, what\nabout a persons right to privacy? This\nis one of the fundamental Human\nRights, guarded by the Human Rights\nAct.\nNot a problem for the Tories it\nseems, as they are planning to annul\nthis cornerstone of Justice. WHAT!\nThis is just plain wrong! The pledge\nreads that under a Tory government,\n\u201cThe Human Rights Act 1998 will be\nrepealed and replaced with a British\nBill of Rights, which will enable the UK\nto rebalance laws in favour of public\nprotection\u201d. Denying a person\u2019s right\nto privacy, whoever that person may\nbe, can never be justified, and the fact\nthat a major political party is actively\nproposing this is very worrying. Especially when, because of the amount\nof in-fighting in the Labour party\nover the recent months, and the little\npublic support for the Liberal Democrats, it looks like they will be our next\nGovernment.\nFixing broken Britain?, or breaking\nBritain some more?\nCries of corruption cripple Romania in run-up to November Presidential Election\nRomania appears to be in turmoil\nfollowing the dismissal of a government minister. Dan Nica, the Internal\nMinister and member of the Social\nDemocratic Party (PSD) was fired by\nPrime Minister Emil Boc of the Democratic Liberal Party (PD-L), who then\nproposed a member of his own party\nas the replacement.\nIn late September Nica made claims\nthat all buses had been hired at the\ntime of the upcoming November elec-tion, alleging that they were going to be\nused to move people around, thereby\nallowing them to vote more than once.\nThe PSD, who are currently the minority party in a coalition government\nwith the PD-L, responded to the dismissal of Nica by all 9 ministers who\nare part of the PSD resigning in protest,\nwhich in turn has caused a lack of confidence in the Romanian government.\nAll this is occurring at a time when\nRomania is struggling to fulfil obligations in a deal for financial aid from the\nIMF- a deal worth \u20ac20bn. The collapse\nof the coalition government prompted\nFitch Ratings to say that Romania\u2019s\ncredit rating with the IMF could be\ndowngraded if it created significant deterioration to economic policies, which\nwould in turn cause long term difficulties for the already troubled state.\nThe threat of this has caused the PSD\nto come out in support of the continuing reforms proposed by the PD-L, but\nthey will also be attempting to join with\nthe liberal opposition to try to bring\ndown Boc\u2019s cabinet in a no confidence\nvote, a move which is likely to create\neven more uncertainty for Romania.\nThe IMF is demanding sweeping fiscal reforms aimed at limiting uninhibited salary growth in the public sector,\nensuring how tax money is spent and\ncontrolled and clarifying salary levels\nin different sectors. The end goal being to free up state money for mod-ernisation, which is vital in bringing\nback foreign investment, preventing a\nfinancing crisis, and diminishing fraud\nin the 2nd most corrupt EU state, as\nrevealed by Transparency International last November.\nIn response to what is perceived as\nJames Lees\nJames Lees Politics Editor\nPhil Murray\nPhil Murray Politics Editor\npublic sector pay cuts, over 800,000\npublic workers have gone out on strike\nin the most wide-ranging protest in the\ncountry since the fall of Communism.\nThe average teacher or hospital\nworker is currently on approximately\n$500 a month, which is significantly\nlower than the average for the EU. As\nsuch, further pay cuts, when combined\nwith the governments\u2019 planned compulsory unpaid leave later this year,\nhave been deemed unacceptable by\ntrade union officials who announced\nstrikes may be extended and a mass\nrally is to be held on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe most wide\nranging protest\nin the country\nsince the fall of\nCommunism\u201d\n\u201call 9 ministers\nwho are part of the\nPSD resigning in\nprotest\u201d\nWant to write for the Politics section?\nEmail any of the Editors at\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Bruno was an out-and-out disappointment, as predictable as\nit was unnecessarily grotesque. Public\nEnemies was saved from the realms\nof forever-forgotten films by the ever-suave Johnny Depp. And, well, the less\nsaid about G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra\nthe better.\nWhereas all these films failed to live\nup to their advertising campaigns,\nNeill Blomkamp\u2019s District 9 surpassed\nthe hype created for it. One could\nbarely avoid the \u201cfor humans only\u201d\nsigns, and the strange silhouettes of\nthe creatures we later got to know as\n\u201cprawns\u201d, plastered all over the streets-a very clever advertising campaign.\nAnyone who went to the cinema in\nthe past year and caught a glimpse\nof the trailers would be familiar with\nthe shot of a huge spaceship hovering\nprecariously over Johannesburg, with\nconfused and distressed news reports\nplayed over the top.\nThe advertising campaign was tantalis-ing, making this film, for me at least, the\nmosteagerlyanticipatedreleaseoftheyear.\nFilmed in a pseudo-documentary\nstyle, the film quickly draws viewers\ninto a world (more specifically, Johannesburg) in which there is a strange\n\u2018District 9\u2019. From a series of quickfire\ninterviews with officials and reporters we learn all we need to know: the\nspaceship appeared some 20 years ago\nand after much deliberation it was decided that if the aliens weren\u2019t going\nto come out, we\u2019d have to go in. The\naliens were found in a very malnourished state, so were removed from the\nship and deposited in District 9, a pur-pose-built refugee camp in the middle\nof Johannesburg.\nAs the years went by it became obvious that the aliens would have to\nstay (their spaceship seemed to have\nstopped working) and District 9 transforms into a fully fledged slum, with\nmore than one millions \u201cprawns\u201d living there. This causes a fair amount of\nsocial unrest: no one wants to live near\nthese \u201cprawns\u201d, with their tentacles and\ncat-food addiction.\nStep in Multi-National United\n(MNU), the organisation responsible\nfor moving the \u201cprawns\u201d to District 10,\n200km outside of Johannesburg. The\nman entrusted to oversee the relocation is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto\nCopley), a nerdy, pen-pushing bureaucrat (seems he could have been\nplucked from any corridor in Imperial)\nwho is given the position more for his\nconnections than his capabilities (his\nfather-in-law is high up in MNU). And\nso the movie begins.\nI won\u2019t divulge any more informa-tion, suffice to say that the aliens are\nnot as peculiar as we first think and\nthe men and women in the film are not\nentirely good and innocent. Made for\na paltry \u00a318 million, the film packs an\nenormous punch. The special effects\nare brilliant throughout and the acting\nis as moving as it is funny. However, a\nfilm set in South Africa that addresses\nracial issues obviously has to face up to\ncertain questions.\nA South African film in which a particular group is shunned, segregated\nand nationally despised simply because of how they look, and who are\neventually understood and assisted by\na middle-class white man\u2026 it sounds\nvery familiar. It\u2019s obviousy about\nApartheid, right? Actually, no, according to director Blomkamp, who says it\nis more about current predicament of\nthe hundreds of thousands of Zimbabwean refugees in South Africa, who\nare treated badly by both white and\nblack South Africans. But why address\nSouth Africa\u2019s recent history \u2013 whether\nit\u2019s Apartheid or the problems faced by\nZimbabweans \u2013 in the terms of an alien movie? Could it be that Blomkamp\nfound it too difficult to make a straight\nfilm about human turmoil in South\nAfrica? It is certainly striking that one\nof the best films about South Africa to\nbe made in years features aliens in the\nplace of blacks \u2013 whether black Zimbabweans or black South Africans. Blomkamp has created a sci-fi masterpiece;\nhis only flaw is that he and the movie\nseem alienated, literally, from recent\nSouth African history.\nShaneO\u2019Neill\nShaneO\u2019Neill\nBrief hello and\na quick rant\nB\nA\nvery warm welcome to\nall the fresher\u2019s and an\neven warmer welcome\nto those returning from\na blissful summer to the\nnext year of ungratifying and pointless\nwork. If you haven\u2019t realised it yet, the\nonly thing that stands a chance in making this coming year bearable and, dare\nI say, enjoyable, is not, as you might\nthink, booze. No, it\u2019s something much\nbetter, something that will get your\nheart racing faster, will make you laugh\nuncontrollably and weep like a child,\nsomething that will make you feel\nalive, happy, sad, depressed, perplexed\nand totally \u2018bungalowed\u2019 without the\nhead splitting, gut emptying, hangover\nnext day.\nThat \u2018something\u2019 is any great movie.\nAnd here at the film section, my humble\nself and your fellow students who feel\nthe need to satisfy their inner \u2018writing\u2019\nsouls, will try to guide you in the quest\nfor the perfect movie to suit your mood.\nIn the dangerous and murky world of\ncinema releases we promise to steer you\nclear of the battalion of film wrecks out\nthere and to scream out the movies you\nmust not miss. And occasionally we will\npublish simple reviews for you to make\nup your own mind.\nAfter that heaping dollop of cheesy\ncliche, let me move on to what\u2019s been\nbothering me since late September. You\nmust have heard about the Swiss arresting Roman Polanski. And you must\nhave heard of the Hollywood outrage\nthat followed, of the Polish, French and\nother governments that made a PUBLIC stand in suppport of the famous di-rector. All I want to know is when exactly we found ourelves in a world where\ncreating a few good movies and being\nrecognized all over the globe makes\nyou above the law. Not many people\nnowadays are naive enough to believe\nthat the world is a fair place, but having it blantanly displayed by the media\nand national governments is as much\nof a shocker as the fact that sometimes\njustice wins.\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nZuzanna Blaszczak Film Editor\nWhat sci-fi is all about\nCHRISTMAS CAME HALF A YEAR EARLY THIS SUMMER WITH\nNEILL BLOMKAMP\u2019S PRAWN INVASION IN SOUTH AFRICA\n...and Away they Go, thank god\nAmerican Beauty, Road to Perdition,\nRevolutionary Road, all award winning\nmovies, with tons of publicity and in-ternational, well-earned acclaim. Apart\nfrom having some common attributes\nlike a rather depressive tone, some ingenious photography, and soundtracks\nthat fit the movies like a glove, they\nalso share the same director. With his\nprevious work Sam Mendes has proved\nthat he can tell a perfect story, one that\ngrips, one that has a moral, with well\ndeveloped characters and inevitably\none that has a memorable ending. It\nthus pains me to have to say that his\nmost recent project, a \u2018no-story\u2019 about\na young quirky couple looking for\ntheir place in the world, does not fulfill\nstandards he got his viewers used to.\nThe movie starts off interestingly\nenough. We are introduced to the main\ncharacters in a amusing and fairly brave\nopening scene. Burt and Verona (John\nKrasinski from the american Office,\nand Maya Rudolph from Idiocracy) are\nin their early thirties, a couple and expecting their first child. After learning\nthat Burt\u2019s parents will be leaving the\nStates for Antwerp for two years they\ndecide to leave their trailer and find a\nnew home for themselves somewhere\nin America. In order to do that they\nvisit their friends and family scattered\naround the north American continent.\nIn the beginning we encounter bizarre and slightly off-kilter characters,\nlike Burt\u2019s parents, Maya\u2019s friends in\nPhoenix or Burt\u2019s friend in Tucson, that\nturn the first thirty minutes of the film\ninto an enjoyable comedy with a good\ndash of social commentary thrown in.\nHowever, as the movie progresses the\nbits and pieces of humorous dialogue\nwe are treated to and the funny scenes\ncome to a stop, to be replaced by everyday drama. I think I understand\nMendes\u2019 attempt to show how real life\nproblems affect real people; how, unlike in the movies, turmoil and tragedy\ngo unnoticed by anyone but the vic-tims. It seems the director also wished\nto make one of those films like Slumdog millionaire or Juno that show the\ndarker side of humanity, fate, life and\nyet, in the end, have a heartwarming\neffect on the viewers. Unfortunately\nDon\u2019t let the hugely stereotyped alien ship fool you, the movie is one of the\nmost original releases this year.\nAway We Go lacks the flair of the\nabove mentioned movies- there is no\nstory, no real character development\nor even a proper soundtrack to carry\nthe initial momentum forward. As the\nfilm takes on it\u2019s more serious tone, the\npace seems to slow down with a lot of\nunnecessary scenes and starts getting\nquite tiresome, especially that even by\nthis time Burt and Verona fail to truly\nendear themselves to the audience.\nIt\u2019s also a bit of a shame that, as usual,\nthe trailers spoil the majority of jokes\nfrom the movie. In the end Away We\nGo is one of the numerous mediocre\nfilms that have no plot holes, no striking unrealism, no visible flaw and yet\nthey\u2019re not particularly entertaining\nto watch, nor have they some deeper\nmeaning to be pondered. The film is\ntoo tender, too sickly sweet and simply\nnot quirky enough. It will surely end\nwhere all mediocre films end, in the\nsweet oblivion of forgetfulness.\n\n"

No\nthanks.\nI\nreally can\u2019t write this column\nabout what\u2019s going on in music\nright now, having been away\nfrom the real world all summer,\ntravelling through the backwaters of India, where record shops barely exist and the only CDs people own\nare psytrance and goa leftovers from\nLSD-fried, enlightment-seeking hip-pies. I have no idea what is happening\nin music right now, and in all honesty I\ndon\u2019t mind at all.\nI had the rare pleasure, a few days\nago, of seeing my friend Terry who\nhad come over from New York to DJ\nand drum in London. We ended up\nin that weird dive of a bar, the 333 in\nShoreditch. While they were playing\nthe Major Lazer track \u201cPon de floor\u201d\nhe quitely mentioned, \u201cthis is me\ndrumming\u201d. How cool is that? That is\npretty cool. That is so cool. I think I\ntold every single person I encountered\nfor the next few days about how cool I\nthought that was.\nBut it probably isn\u2019t very cool if you\nare the person saying it. If anything\nyou would probably be bored of people telling you how cool it is. So many\nboys pick up guitars and dream of the\nday their band makes it big, the next\nLibertines, the next Rolling Stones, the\nnext Sonic Youth. But what if you are,\nwould it be cool then? Look at Pete\nDoherty, if you can bear to look at his\nsweaty-cheese-left-out-of-the-fridge\nface. All the sadness of his life choices\nbegan with being in a band that made\nit big. Maybe the same would have\nhappened to him if he had taken another path, but I doubt it.\nI don\u2019t think I could ever be a musician (not that I have one thimble-full of\nthe talent required anyway). If I talk to\nanyone about music, there are always\na generous handful of musicians that\npeople will say \u201cI fucking hate _____\u201d\nabout. Why? Because they make\nmusic you don\u2019t enjoy? People say,\n\u201coh, I hate that La Roux! She says she\ndoesn\u2019t like Lady Gaga\u201d and \u201cLily Allen\nis a bitch! Did you hear what she said\nabout Girls Aloud?\u201d. For some reason,\nto make music and not be venomously\nhated by large proportions of people\nyou have never met, you have to avoid\nhaving an opinion on anything, and\neven then maybe you would be called\nboring. Artists get bottled at festivals.\nThey are picked apart and chewed\nup and judged like no-one else in any\nother field, except perhaps Hollywood\nactors. Only unlike Hollywood actors,\nthey don\u2019t really make any money, they\nlive on freebies.\nBeing a rock/pop/rap star is like a\nmodern equivalent of the American\nDream. A fantasy that will never live\nup to it\u2019s promise. Perhaps I\u2019m pretty\ncynical and jaded. I would ask my\nAmerican friend what he thinks but\nhe\u2019s playing a festival in Beijing with\nBuzzcocks, partying in the swankiest hotels and waking up in beds with\nanonymous girls. Hmm. Maybe it\u2019s\nnot too bad after all.\nAlex Ashford\nAlex Ashford Music Editor\nReviews\nPerhaps in Denmark \u201890s pop music didn\u2019t happen, because this music\nsounds like a Gina G b-side, it\u2019s light\nand frothy but it doesn\u2019t have that \u201cooh\nahh\u201d that Gina G had. On the one\nhand I love \u201890s pop music and I hope\nthis is a sign that music might go back\nto making pop classics like \u201cget into\nthe groove\u201d, but I fear this song already\nsounds like it belongs in the bargin bin\nat a petrol station. - Alex Ashford\nA\ngig venue for indepedent\nartists and unsigned bands?\nIn South Kensington, at the\nRoyal Albert Hall? I didn\u2019t\nbelieve it either, this had to be seen to\nbe believed.\nAs I walked to the recently refurbished Elgar Room (in the past used\nby The Central School of Speech\nand Drama to train actors such as\nSir Laurence Olivier, Dame Judi Dench\nand Harold Pinter) it was a little difficult to imagine skinny jeaned indie kids\ntraipsing through the building. But also\npretty exciting. In a venue that usually\nplays host to dinner jackets and gowns,\na few hoodies and checked shirts walking around is almost subversive.\nThe Hush nights have been around for\na while but it\u2019s only now that the Elgar\nRoom has been specifically converted\nfor gigs. In the past artists such as Johnny Flynn, Little Boots and Cocknbullkid\nhave been intruders in a faux-Victorian\nroom but now with past greats such as\nJimi Hendrix adorning the walls and an\nultra-low stage, this is now a truly intimate venue for unknown, up and coming artists.\nALPHABEAT\nTHE SPELL\nPOLYDOR\nThis is lovely, floaty, folky, indie music,\nwith a singer that sounds a bit like Anthony from Anthony & the Johnsons /\nHercules and Love Affair. The lyrics\nare a bit weird, \u201cscaring the oldies into\ntheir dressing gowns/as the dripping\ndogs howl\u201d? But it\u2019s good. I like it. You\nmight too. - Alex Ashford\nIf you like music with lots of sweeping guitars and some tinkling pianos\nand heartfelt vocals, but Radiohead\nare a bit depressing/weird for you, you\nmight like this. The lyrics are a bit\nrubbish but I think this sort of music\nis for boys who will hear it on Radio 1\nin their car and aren\u2019t likely to listen to\nthe lyrics anyway. - Alex Ashford\nBLACKGOLD\nRUSH\nRED BULL\nRECORDS\nIt\u2019s damn good, and better than most\nelectro, but not as good as his first al-bum. - Kadhim Shubber\nBOYS NOIZE\nPOWER\nBOYS NOIZE\nRECORDS\nALBUM\nSINGLE\nALBUM\nWILDBEASTS\nTWO DANCERS\nDOMINO\nALBUM\n\u2018At the Bottom\u2019 is the first single from\nBrand New\u2019s new album, Daisy. Released digitally a month prior to Daisy,\nthe New York band continues to musically lurch ahead of their peers with\neach album. However, \u2018At the Bottom\u2019\nindicates a progression from 2006\u2019s\n\u2018Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me\u2019\nless drastic than those between previous LPs.\nThough the pop-punk roots of old\nhave truly decayed with the release of\n\u2018At the Bottom\u2019, the emotion of their\ntracks is still fruitfully evident in\nthe screaming chants of Jesse Lacey\noverlaying the measured whines of\nguitars.\n\u2018At the Bottom\u2019 just falls short of the\ntag of an impressive first single from\ntheir new album, but it is sure to lead\na steady flow of quality singles in the\nnext year; it will please fans but will not\ncatch the casual listeners\u2019 attention. -Dan Wan\nBRAND NEW\nAT THE BOTTOM\nPOLYDOR\nSINGLE\nApparently Japanese Voyeurs (not\nactually Japanese at all) make music\nabout \u201cinfantile fantasies, crushing\ndisappointments and sexual repression\u201d. This song seems to have a bit of\nall 3 and if you can get past the slightly\nstrange vocals and lyrics, it\u2019s a fairly\nsolid piece of noise rock.\n- Richard Waldie\nJAPANESE\nVOYEURS\nSICKING &\nCREAMING\nSLIMEBALL\nEP\nIt\u2019s fairly promising, but unfortunately\nthis piece of Scottish post-hardcore\nnever really goes anywhere. Flood of\nRed are worth a listen if you\u2019re hardcore keano, but there isn\u2019t really much\nthere to stand out above some of the\nmore established groups.\n- Richard Waldie\nFLOODS OF RED\nHOME, RUN\nDARK CITY\nSINGLE\nThey\u2019re back after 15 years without an\nalbum with a new singer, this album is\nvery good. It\u2019s got enough of the old\nstyle AIC crunch but does enough to\nsound current. Most importantly Duvall\u2019s vocals offer a fitting replacement\nto the late great Layne Staley without\nsounding derivative. Superb.\n- Richard Waldie\nALICE IN\nCHAINS\nBLACK GIVES\nWAY TO BLUE\nPARLOPHONE\nALBUM\nI hoped a band called \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d might sound like Animal Collective covering the Lion King sound-track, but sadly this sounds like a blend\nof all the indie/folk bands around at the\nmoment. I could see myself enjoying it\nin the middle of a playlist but it\u2019s not a\nstand out track. - Alex Ashford\nANIMAL\nKINGDOM\nSIGNS &\nWONDERS\nWILD\nSINGLE\nWednesday 14th October, Alan\nPownall, Jonathan Jeremiah, Jose\nVanders and Liam Bailey.\nTickets \u00a36 students/\u00a37.50 advance/\u00a310\nwww.royalalberthall.com\nIt\u2019s true what they say isn\u2019t it?

Here\u2019s Aunty McPickle in the meanwhile\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI have a worrying and embarrassing\nqualm. I have recently been subject\nto the cacophonous sounds of my flat\nmate\u2019s climatic orgasms. The odd\nthing is no one ever seems to enter\nor leave her room before or after. I\ncan only assume that she is an expert\nauto-pleasure-er. The thing is, I have\nstarted to join in when I know that\nshe\u2019s \u201con it\u201d\n. I don\u2019t consider myself a\nlesbian; I have up until now only had\nheterosexual desires. Do you think\nI\u2019m gay?\nA confused Sally Fanita\nDear Sally,\nThis is a puzzling predicament. The\nway I see it you should consider exploring this recent recreation. Maybe go for\nsome sneaky online girl on girl porn\nand see if this has any effect.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with exploring and as long as you are quieter than\nyour flat mate, nobody has to know.\nMaybe you should also check the validity of your heteorsexualness... hook up\nwith some hunky hussie? Then perhaps\nyou could \u201caccidently\u201d stumble into the\nflat mate in question\u2019s room and slip\ninto a threesome?\nTry to break the barriers and you\nmight find yourself exercising a liberated libido.\nAunty McPickle xxx\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI have recently found a massive blue\ndildo in my girl friend\u2019s draw. I am\nstruggling with feelings of redun-dancy, what should I do?\nA deflated Derik\nDear Derik,\nWell sounds like your girlfriend is pretty\nrandy. Are you sure you are exploiting\nthis rather handsome characteristic?\nMaybe she doesn\u2019t use it anymore, and\nironically the dildo is the redundant\nparty.\nHow about \u201cinnocently\u201d suggesting\nusing one and observe her reaction or\nbe honest and just ask her about it.\nDepending on the openness (no pun\nintended) of your relationship she may\nbe likely to embellish the truth, so try to\nread her body language.\nIf it really bothers you, you could hide\nit or throw it away. She\u2019ll probably\nthink she\u2019s lost it. If you find a new one\nin its place, then you\u2019ll know what\u2019s going on and confrontation may be need-ed. Otherwise, how about slapping on\nsome body paint?\nAunty McPickle xxx\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI am currently stuck in the union toilets with a rather persistent deposit,\nwhich won\u2019t go down. I have friends\nwaiting and their suspicions are undoubtedly growing by the minute.\nPlease help!\nLillie McPhilyme\nHi Lillie,\nMmm this is a dilemma. Here are what\nI consider these to be your options:\n1. Leave the unpleasant present for the\nnext unlucky toilet dweller to discover\nand prey that you don\u2019t know them and\nnever see them again.\n2. Stay there all night, flushing away\nuntil it finally goes or the lights are\nturned off which would open up the\nperfect opportunity for your escape.\n3. Try the toilet brush trick\n4. Avidly defend that it wasn\u2019t you to\nthe next frequenter.\n5. Crawl seamlessly under the door into\nthe next cubicle and make a run for it.\n6. Put the toilet seat down as a pre-warning, (probably the kindest option)\nand leave ashamedly, face down.\n7. Put something baggish over your\nhead to avoid future recognition for the\nrest of your time at Imperial.\nOn return to your friends you can\neither make up an elaborate but believable story or just pretend that the\nduration of your absence wasn\u2019t an abnormally long time. Hope that helps, in\nthe future maybe you should consider\nimproving the timing of your digestive\ntraffic.\nAunty McPickle xxx\nNot blue, but definitely a dildo\nAs of this year, RAG has a weekly\npiece in felix, meaning I get to annoy you issue after issue! For all\nof you who have never come across\nRAG before, let me enlighten you (all\nof you who already know what RAG\nis should read on cause it\u2019s really very\nquite interesting). We raise money for\nour chosen charities in any way possi-ble.

You then need to make your\nway back to the Union for the after\nparty. Someone told me there will be\nprizes\u2026\nEverything we do is great fun (oth-erwise we wouldn\u2019t organise it!), so it\u2019s\ndefinitely worth giving it a try. If you\nthing RAG is something you\u2019d enjoy or\nyou want to get LOST, give us a shout\nat rag@ic.ac.uk.\nRAG is here to stay\n...and the most illustrious RAG chair, Alex Dahinten, is here to tell\nyou all about the wonderful things they have planned for you\n\n"

    "content": "3\nfelix FRIDAY 09 OCTOBER 2009\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEastside is back: bigger and better\nT\nwo years after the demoli-sion of Linstead Hall, the\nnew Halls of Residences\nhave finally opened in its\nplace. With the Southside Halls\ncompleted two years ago, the Eastside development now completes\nImperial\u2019s Princes\u2019 Gardens restoration project.\nLast Saturday saw Eastside\u2019s Wilkinson, Gabor and Linstead Halls receive\ntheir first intake of Freshers for the\nnew year. Eastside Bar and Essentials\nshop, the two outlets available to students on the ground floor, also began\nthe academic year in full swing having\nopened a week previously.\nThough the design mirrors the\nSouthside complex, there have been\nseveral major alterations to the living\nspaces.\nThe new intake can count themselves extremely lucky to be living in\nsuch pristine and luxurious accommo-dation, and both students and parents\nwere impressed alike. Prince\u2019s Gardens\nthis week is in stark contrast to pre-2005 before the project to transform\nwhat College has dubbed the Prince\u2019s\nGardens \u2018residential village\u2019.\nThe felix team inspected out the\nnew halls last weekend as the Freshers\nmoved into their new homes.\nEach Hall houses around 150 stu-dents, whom are mostly living in single occupancy rooms. The students\nare accommodated throughout nine\nfloors, with Ground and Basement\nfloors now living spaces.\nHowever, the most evident design\nchange from Southside are the kitchens\non each floor. On a tour given by User\nCo-ordinator of the Eastside project\nPaddy Jackman, it was explained feedback surveys from Southside residents\nwere used to determine areas of design\nalteration for the new project. Students\nthat lived in Southside had brought\nup the issue of using their communal\nkitchens, typically shared between 16-24 people, on their own. They felt the\nkitchens were unwelcoming and cold\nwhen cooking and eating alone. The\nSouthside Halls have been previously\ncriticised by residents for being \u201cunhomely\u201d and \u201ctoo clinical\u201d.\nIn response to this negative feedback,\nJackman explained the implementation of a double-kitchen feature for\nthe larger floors in the three Eastside\nHalls. Kitchens have been scaled down\nfrom the typical Southside dimensions very slightly, but still retain several communal eating and preparation\nareas. However, a secondary smaller\nkitchenette now lies around the corner from the large one. This secondary kitchenette has been designed to\nmimic a typical home kitchen in size\nand utility. To further counteract the\nclinical feel in Southside, countertops\nare a faux-granite pattern instead of\nstainless steel.\nAlongside two differently- sized widescreen televisions, the double-kitch-ens feature shared cupboards, fridges\nand freezers; they have no designated\ncompartments installed. Hall Senior\nCarlotta Ridolfi is already seeing the\nbenefits of these alterations.\n\u201cThe kitchens are lot more communal which promote an element of\ntrust and sharing amongst us. We\u2019re\nlearning to live with each other with\na lot more respect for other people\u2019s\nthings. It can only help the first years\nonce they move out to real houses,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cThe place has generally a more\nfriendly environment compared to\nSouthside.\u201d\nRoom sizes have also been better\nregulated throughout the design stages\nof the Eastside construction. Southside\nsuffered from an inequality of room\nFresher mugged on her very first day at Imperial\nsizes when it first opened two years ago,\ndespite all residents paying rent from a\ncorresponding single price-band. Single occupancy rooms have been clearly\ncategorised into three bands: standard,\npremium and deluxe. Premium and deluxe rooms have extra space compared\nto standard, and are fitting with a larger\nbed and armchair.\nDespite these luxuries, there has\nbeen debate from several Union officials regarding the pricing of the new\nprice-bands for rooms in Eastside.\nStandard rooms fall into price-band\n\u201cE\u201d, the second most expensive band\nin this year\u2019s rent pricing system, and\nwill cost students \u00a3176.47 per week.\nPremium rooms will set back residents\n\u00a3188.65, and deluxe rooms \u00a3219.59.\nThe few double rooms within the three\nhalls are priced at \u00a3130.83. Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) John James stated\nthat he was pleased with Eastside and\nits rental rates.\n\u201cEastside isn\u2019t cheap but it is good\nvalue. The rooms are luxurious, there\u2019s\nample social space and the facilities\non the door step are superb. Eastside\nis second to none and that is reflected\nin the price, although efforts such as\na creating a relatively high percentage\nof twin rooms have been made to keep\nprices down.\u201d\nThe Eastside complex features a new\nbar and convenience shop; both are\navailable to students, staff and the pub-lic. The new bar, cleverly named \u2018Eastside\u2019, has been open for a week prior to\nthe Freshers\u2019 arrival. College staff were\ninvited for a welcome party and lunchtime promotions took place throughout the week. The bar-cum-restaurant\nreplaces Harringtons, Southside\u2019s\noriginal bar, which closed down when\nthe original Southside complex was\ndemolished in 2005.\nEastside bar serves drinks at prices\nslightly dearer than the Union\u2019s Da\nVinci\u2019s bar. A pint of Fosters\u2019 lager\ncosts \u00a32.50 compared to the Union\u2019s\ncheap-as-chips \u00a32.00. Reception has\nbeen so far positive.\nThe convenience store has been generically dubbed \u2018Essentials\u2019, and offers\nstudents a wide range of alcohol, and a\nslimmer range of vegetables and food.\nThe delivery of stock on moving-in day\nlargely contained the popular brand\nof instant mashed potato, Smash, and\nseveral varieties of vodka.\nFrom shop shelf to home oven: Essentials convenience store (left) and a first floor \u2018kitchenette\u2019 in Wilkinson Hall\nA new student to Imperial College has\nbeen mugged after Saturday\u2019s Mingle,\nin an event that left the victim with\ninjuries.\nThe student, unnamed, was walking\nback to her halls at around 2AM with a\nfriend from the year\u2019s opening event at\nthe Union. The pair were approached\non Prince Consort Road by three men\nasking for a spare cigarette. The situation escalated by the Royal Albert\nMansions.\nThe female victim was left with a\nsuspected broken arm after she got\ncaught up in a fight between her male\nfriend and the three muggers. The\nmale victim has been said to be quite\nbadly bruised. As the scuffle broke out,\na handbag containing several expensive personal items were taken. All the\nvictim\u2019s cards and Blackberry phone\nwere claimed to be inside. No property\nof the male vitcim was taken.\nAfter the muggers fled the scene, the\npair desperately made their way back\nto Beit Quad to notify security of the\nhappenings. However, security was\nnot present at the Security Lodge under the archway to the Union. Instead,\nthey caught the attention of Union\nstaff clearing away after close.\nTwo members of the Union staff\nthen escorted the pair to Weeks Hall\nsecurity as it was the nearest manned\nsecurity office. During the short walk\nto Prince\u2019s Gardens, there was a further verbal altercation on Exhibition\nRoad between the male friend and another group of individuals.\nThe three attackers were inside the\nUnion during the Mingle\u2019s entertainment hours and hence it is to be questioned if the attackers were also Imperial students.\nThe Mingle is the Freshers\u2019 very first\nchance to meet each other and see live\nacts; Jo Whiley and MPho performed\non the night. The problem lies with the\nfact that the new intake of students did\nnot yet have any official College identification to prove their legibility to enter the Mingle. The tickets were generally sold through Halls\u2019 wardening\nteams to ensure only Imperial students\nwere present at the event. However,\nit is confirmed that some tickets were\nsold on the door. If the muggers were\nindeed not Imperial students, on-the-night tickets were an easy way into the\n\u00a37.50 event.\nThe three men in question are said\nto be Asian ethnicity. Police are in the\nmiddle of an on-going investigation\ninto the incidents.\nDeputy President (Welfare) John\nJames acknowledged the unfortunate\nincident.\n\u201cThe Union regrets this incident and\ncan assure students that the police are\ndoing everything in their power to\nidentify the attacker.\u201d\nIt is largely unusual for incidents of this\nnature to occur around or on campus.\nPrevious incidents of muggings involving Imperial students that have occurred\nhave generally occured in Hyde Park.\nA theft of a bag from the Union on\nTuesday night has also been reported\nDan Wan\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief\nto police. The owner of the laptop\nbag was not an Imperial student, but\nactually a visitor. The bag was said to\ncontain personal documentation including a passport and qualification\ncertificates. The events that occured\nlast week are thought not to be con-nected. Deputy President James has\nsome words of warning for the rest of\nthe student body.\n\u201cWe would like to take this opportunity to remind the student body to be\nalert and wary when out and about in\nall parts of London and that personal\nattack alarms are available from the\nAdvice Centre.\u201d\nAlbert Hall Mansions laden with scaffolding, where the mugging took place\nJust over two years under construction, Eastside finally re-opens.

These may\ninclude halls, departments or clubs\nand societies. Compared with such\nprominent familial groupings, Faculty\nUnions are sometimes overlooked.\nHowever, they do provide many different services and it might help to know\nwhat these are.\nThe Unions are student run organisations here to represent their peers at\na faculty level within Imperial College.\nThey are elected officers, students like\nyourselves, who will be providing social opportunities and answering your\nquestions over the course of your time\nat University.\nThey all have academic and welfare\nofficers who can provide helpful advice if required, without having to go\nthrough more formal procedures with\nuniversity staff. They also provide a\nbroad range of services to departmental societies and help them in their\nliaisons with the College to improve\ncourse content based on the needs\nof the students. As such they are well\nplaced to negotiate on behalf of their\nmembers should anything go wrong.\nBut most of all, they aim to promote\nhaving fun through organising lots\nof social events throughout the year.\nWhether it be dressing up to the nines\nfor one of the Faculty Union Freshers\u2019\nBalls, downing yards during a traditional bar night or laughing till you wet\nyourself at live comedy nights, Faculty\nUnions are the guys who organise specific events for Scientists, Engineers or\nMedics respectively.\nAdditionally, all the Faculties have\ntheir own clubs and societies and organise their own inter-departmental\nas well as inter-faculty sports leagues.\nThere are also subject specific societies such as Surgical Society, Engineers\nWithout Borders and SSETI (Student\nSpace Explotation Initiative)\nNot found anything to your taste\nyet? Get in touch with the teams introduced opposite and tell them what\nyou think your Faculty Union can do\nfor you. They always welcome feedback and would love to hear new ideas\nfor future events, better representation\nor longer term projects within your\nFaculties.\nThe Royal College of Science Union\nThe Royal College of Science Union represents around 4000 students at Imperial College. Anyone who has opted to\nstudy science in its purest form is automatically part of it, no signing up is necessary and there is no membership fee.\nSo what do we actually do? Well, first\nand foremost we are here so that you are\nable to speak your mind at the highest level of the union, making sure that you have\na voice. At an institution as large as Imperial it can be easy to get lost in the crowd, we\nmake sure that whenever you, as a student\nor indeed as a person, need assistance or\nhave any qualms about your course or the\nservices on offer to you, there is a way for\nyou to be heard.\nOne of our main aims this year espe-Your Vice-President this year, Jacqueline\nFok, has the level-headed approach\nneeded to carry out her role. Having\npreviously held the position of Treasurer,\nher experience and financial know-how\nmake her well suited to carrying out the\ntask of securing sponsorship and liaising\nwith external companies so that we can\nprovide you with career information and\nopportunities. She will also be overseeing\nthe activity of the departmental societies\nso if you have any problems in that area\ndo not hesitate to contact her, she is very\nfriendly and will provide you with all the\nadvice you need.\nTim has been actively involved in\nstudent welfare for some time now and\nis standing for the position of Welfare\nOfficer. He has used the summer to\nprepare a good welfare infrastructure\nwithin the RCSU. He will be holding\nwelfare drop-in sessions every week\nand will always be available for you to\ncontact should you need any advice or\nhelp.\nIn case any of you have forgotten (I\ncertainly do at times), you are embarking\non a challenging and sometimes difficult\ndegree. Our academic affairs officer\nis committed to ensuring that you are\nrepresentedwithinthecollege.Alongwith\nyour departmental representative he will\nbe happy to help should you get into any\ndifficulty with your course or if you need\nany advice on how to handle the stresses\nof studying here.\nImperial College School of Medicine Student Union\nICSMSU is the Faculty of Medicine\nUnion and represents all undergraduate medics, graduate entry\nmedics, biomedical scientists and\npharmacologists.\nThink of ICSMSU as your one-stop\nshop for all you need at medical\nschool; be it clubs and socs, welfare,\nsocial events, love-life counselling,\nloft conversions, etc. If we can\u2019t do it,\nwe know someone who can! We are\nbased at two main sites; our main office is on the ground floor of the SAF\nBuilding and the other is the Reynolds\nBuilding at Charing Cross Hospital.\ncially is to improve the quality of events\nthat we offer to you, ensuring that as\nwell as a variety of club and bar nights\nwe also cater for those less inclined to\nspend every waking hour in a state of\ndrunken stupor. We will be holding a series of comedy nights and guest lectures\nas well as, of course, our extremely popular nights of alcohol-fuelled carnage.\nWe will be holding drop-in welfare clin-ics,aswellasensuringthattheRCSUoffice\nis manned every lunchtime by members of\nour committee so that you have a port of\ncall if you need it. In addition there will be\na day of the week when your departmental representative will be there so that you\ncan come and ask questions or talk about\nyour course.\nRichard becomes the ICSM President if I\nwere forced to take \u201cunfortunate leave\u201d; I\nwish he would stop putting those pills in\nmy tea.\nKat exists to make people happier.\nAlso known as \u201cThe Big D\u201d Dave\norganises the quiet, sober non-eventful\nnights that the medical school is best\nknown for\u2026\nMy name is Anil Chopra, I am the\nICSMSU President.

Garrett\nWhere we ask gamers to tell us about the characters they love to take control of. This week, SKW sneaks in.\nS\no I creep, yeah\nJust keep it\non the\ndown\nlow\nSaid nobody is supposed to know\nNow, don\u2019t get me\nwrong. I like being\nthe hero. I like being noble, valiant yet\nhumble; its like I just\nstepped out of an old-fashioned \u2018Sign Up\nNow\u2019 army poster; I\ncan almost smell the\napple-pie and freedom\nthat I\u2019m supposed to be\nfighting for.\nBut there is a limit.\nI may say I am vastly\nunderstating it when I\nsay that games are not\nknown for their exquisite character devel-opment. Your average gaming hero is\na one-dimensional\npiece of card; a Hollywood clich\u00e9 lifted\nfrom a thoroughly\nindifferent block-buster. Also \u2013 it\nmight just be said \u2013\ncheerfully American,\nno matter where their\ncharacter is actually\nsupposed to be from.\nThat is why I find Garrett, from the Thief series of games,\nsuch a refreshing character to play.\nLiberty? Freedom? Garrett doesn\u2019t\ncare for these idle notions, these intangible ideals. Garrett fights for\nno-one but himself, and even\nthen, he\u2019d prefer to run away\nand slip into the shadows.\nGarrett is no hero; don\u2019t\nyou come to him with\nyour bleeding-heart\ntales of woe, your\nwarnings of a dire evil\nthat threatens mankind.\nUnless you have a damn\ngood lever on Garrett \u2013\nand a reward of a bulging coin-purse, of course\n\u2013 Garrett will show you\nthe door. And pick-pock-et you on the way out,\nnaturally.\n\u2018Does Garrett have\nno soul, no heart?\u2019 you\nmight perhaps cry. But\nGarrett\u2019s steampunk\nworld is nothing like\nthe cut-and-dried\nworld of less realised games; there is\nno black and white\ndivide between\ngood and evil in\nGarrett\u2019s world.\nHis city is a mass\nof struggling power blocs, with their\nown agendas and plans.\nGarrett has truly lived out\nthe maxim \u2018the enemy of my enemy is my friend\u2019 in a way, few gaming\nheroes get to experience: he knows that\none man\u2019s \u2018threat to mankind\u2019 is another man\u2019s saviour. After all, he used to be\na member of the Keeper sect; a group\nof powerful seers that seek to keep the\ncity\u2019s power blocs in balance. Chafing\nunder their restrictive ways, Garrett left\nthem, and turned their teachings in the\narts of stealth to his own glorious profit.\nGarrett is jaded, cynical, wry and\nlaconic. Garrett\u2019s sarcasm is no fake\nbluster, though: he truly would let the\nworld go hang for a penny.\nGarrett is also \u2013 lets not beat about\nthe bush here \u2013 pretty damn sexy. The\namount of lascivious fan-fiction written about him probably exceeds that\nof any other gaming hero. Those other\nheroes are usually healthy 6 footers,\ndefined more by their looks or muscles\nthan their characters. Garrett is pretty\nmuch an opposing figure; his face is\nmore interesting than handsome \u2013\nhell, he only has one eye (the other is\na mechanical replacement that gleams\neerily). Nevertheless, his dry sarcastic\nvoice, his ruthless self-servicing ways,\nhis hard shell, his efficiency... he has\nmore personality than most games can\nmanage to create in all their characters\nput together, never mind in their hero.\n\u201cDoes Garrett have\nno soul, no heart?\u201d\nOther games waste no time in flaunting their hero\u2019s physique, but Garrett is\nhardly ever even seen, let alone going\naround strutting his stuff. Loose black\ngarb and a hood are Garrett\u2019s chosen\nwear, not a tight-fitting \u2018look at me!\u2019\nwardrobe. Garrett is all about mys-tique. Will his hard shell ever crack,\nand let Garrett show anything other\nthan very, very measured affection for\nno one but himself? I devoutly hope\nnot.\n\n"
