He\nbegan his talk by stating that he was neither pro-communist, nor anti-communist, but merely a Jew who was interested in combating antisemitism wherever it might occur.\nAnti-semitism in the Soviet Union manifests itself in a number\nof forms. First of all there is anti-semitism on an \" official\" level.\nAt one time, just after the revolution, Jews flooded into the Universities and into the professions which had been denied to them under\nthe Czars. To-day these numbers are small and falling, whereas the\nstatistics for other minority groups remain fairly constant.\nNo Bibles\nUnlike all other national or religious groups, Jews do not have any\ncentral organisation, nor any religious\npublications( all Hebrew Bibles date\nTHE\nENGINEER\nEngineers in the chemical industry mm mm j^ mm^m mm\ncan fairly claim to face a wider range 1 1 % 1 Lf ~\nof interesting problems than in any I|%|'B^ other industry, ICI is in the forefront JLJL ^\n1 JL ^^mS mm\nof the chemical industry and offers\nvirtually unlimited variety of opportunity in design, development, production,\nresearch, and many forms of industrial management.

When attempts were made to bake and distribute \" matzot,\" the unleavened\nbread which Jews eat at passover, a few old men were sent to prison as\nspeculators. Synagogues have . been\nbranded as centres of corruption and\nanti-state economic activity, and even\nsubversive political activity.

There are\nno Jewish schools, no Yiddish theatres, and only a handful of Yiddish books have been published since\nthe war. Capital offence\nEconomic crimes are a capital offence in the Soviet Union, and it is\ninteresting to note that according to\npublished information about 80 per\ncent of those who have been shot for these offences have been Jews. The International Commission of Jurists\nhas prepared a study on this subject,\nand came to the conclusion that, as in the past, the Jews have been made\nthe scapegoats for the transgressions\nof these whose guilt it would be dangerous to make public. Mr. Hans man's description of the\nstate of Soviet Jewry was followed by\nquestions and discussion. The members of the Communist Society present\nfeared that the W.U. J.S. campaign would receive support in some quarters more because of anticommunist prejudice than from genuine \"anti-racial is m. They made it clear that\nthey themselves were strongly opposed\nto antisemitism in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, and the campaign appeared to have the unanimous support\nof the meeting.\nN.

In it he complains that no notice of the intended\" lobbying\" of M.

The letter then rambled on with' fatherly' advice that the proposal had lost most of its support, and that Adrian Fletcher ought to reconsider the decision of the Union.IsM r. Fisk really surprised that he and the rest of NUS Y/ ere not\ninformed?

    "content": "Sportlight\nIT'S A SHAME\nI wouldn't exactly say ' we wu z robbed' but is was a great shame that we didn'twin the Gut te ridge Cup. Although the better team did win the\ngame could easily have gone the other way and would have provided a fine end to a good rugby season. In spite of many team injuries (the team\nI watched last Saturday was very much changed from the one I watched in the qu ater final) Pe' \u00bb Ray has made an excellent job of moulding the\nteam into a fighting unit and I'm sure this has won them many games\nthey should have lost on paper.\nWhatever the reason for our defeat it wasn't want of trying nor even for lack of support. The turn out of supporters for the final was fantastic;\nth ty were slightly more numerous and certainly far more vocal than U.C.' s and I know for certain that it made a tremendous difference to trie tea i a and that they are very grateful to everybody that went along.*** Everytime Igo into the Gym there are people weight training \u2014 this is a GOOD THING. To do this they generally find a spare bar, take it to\nan empty bit of floor and start lifting \u2014 this is a BAD THING. The floor\nshou d n't be empty, it should have am at on it;; those black rubber mats\nare no trouble to get out and bouncing weights down is the quickest way to ruin the floor. It may not be much of a gym but it's the only one we' ve got. These remarks apply particularly to clubs organising large scale\ntraining sessions.\nThe first meeting of 'Stoats' last month was only a partial success : not enough members realised that it was on and several clubs had other\ncommitments. However every member has now been informed officially\nof his election so there are no ex cusses for not turning up tomorrow( Thursday) in the Union Bar. There are still one or two clubs from whom we have not heard yet. New members are elected via their Captain so if he isn't interested they are penal is d for his neglect.\nFrank Hobson\nHockeyCOLLEGE QUITS LEAGUE\nAlthough the college 1st XI has\nwithdrawn from the University League for next season, on the grounds that\nmore enjoyable hockey can be obtained elsewhere, the final matches of this season's competition provided some of the best hockey played by\nI.C. since before Christmas. After an easy 6-0 win over U.C.I I and a disappointing22 draw with Q.M. C,, Woolwich Poly were beaten 7-0\n( Hough4, Goddard3) and as aswan song last year's winners Battersea\nwere beaten 3-2. The record for the\neight matches is : Played8, won5, lost 1, drawn2; goals for20, against\n7, which should secure a place in the\ntop 3.\nThe Saturday picture however, is\none of single goal defeats or draws.\nInvariably this has been due to the\nlack of really continual attacking with the result that the defence finds itself\npushed for too great a proportion of the game. When chances for goals\nhave arrived the forwards have been\nunable to turn from defence to assist-ing Hough, who often has been alone\nin sorties near the enemy's goal.\nPerhaps the older members of the\ncollege are too sentimental, but Iam sure that the standard of clubman ship, was higher once throughout I.C. sport. However, the devastating up lift in morale when our unchanged\nside turns out for every game cannot\nbe denied.\nIn spite of a few disappointments\nduring the season the club looks forward to a very memorable visit to the\nWeymouth Hockey Festival over\nEaster.\nRay Phillips\nThe following was found in an empty bottle washed up on the\nKent coast and signed by a Master Potts\nOn Friday,25 th February, at about 8.30 p.m.,25 members of the RAM. Rugby Club left the Union Bar bound for the Ecole des Mines, Paris. After a couple of drinks at \"Victoria the team attempted to board the train. One unfortunate individual who had come to Victoria to see the team off was kid napped and held captive on the train till it had left the station. However the\nunfortunate prisoner escaped at East Croydon where he had great difficulty\nin explaining to the railway officials as to why he didn't have a ticket.\nNo further incident occurred and the boat was boarded at Newhaven in a fairly orderly fashion. However, once onboard, the lure of duty free\ndrink soon had most of the team\nfeeling under the weather especially as\nthe crossing to Dieppe was one of the roughest for some time.\nThe train journey to Paris was marred by a very officious ticket col lector who insisted that there was one in ;m ber too many in the party. Un fortunately he was right and Chris Mola m had to hand over the required fare.\nOn arrival at Paris at 8.00 a. m.we were met by our hosts who kindly informed us that we were due to play\nrugby at 10.00 a.m. After depositing\nVan Kimmel man in bed at the Ecole des Mines we made our way to the\ngro un J. where we managed to beat the\nEcole ds Mines116 by the unusual\ntactics t.T bringing on8 substitutes at\nhalf tire. After the game a light lunch and several glasses of the local brew were\nenjoyed by everyone in the team except Van Kimmel man who was still\nin bed. Then in the afternoon we had to endure the spectacle of England being hammered by France in the I nternational at Columb es Stadium. In the evening, after waking Van Kimmel man, we were very generously\nentertained by the Ecole des Mines students. A cafe was taken over for the evening and the captains of both\nthe R.S. M. and Ecole des Mines Rugby teams were forced to do a Zum ba much to the the amusement\nof the waitresses present.\nThe journey back was fairly quiet as\nmost of the team were feeling the\naffect of fairly large quantities of wine and we finally arrived back at\nVictoria at 8.00 a.m. Sunday, tired\nout but very satisfied with the week-end. The only mishap of the trip was that the team secretary managed to\nlose his kit somewhere between Paris\nand Dieppe. Gutteridee Cup\n15\nBill Jenkins\nNOT ENOUGH LUCK\nU.C.9I. C.6 THE GUT TE RIDGE CUP final\nheld at Mot spur Park last Saturday proved to be the Mecca of many I.C. students both past and present.\nHere under the eagle eye of the\nRector they packed the main part of the stand and after being treated to\na fifteen minute performance laughingly called seven a side rugby, chanted, chanted heck ed and willed I.C. towards their first cup win in four years. But support must be matched by performance and points\nso in spite of el khor o, trumpet and the Rhodesian oath of Potts it was U.C. by two tires and a penalty goal\n(9 pts) to two penalty goals (6 pts)\nwho carried off the cup for this\nseason.\nU.C.' s win though not sealed until the last minute was well merited since for most of th t match they\nlooked the more dangerous side.\nTheir pack in both line out and tight\nprovided quick clean posse sion and a fast service from the base of the scrum gave Ry ding( outside half) in nu merab lt opportunities to use his\nlast ten minutes of the first halt and most of the second combined effect-iv ely in the loose. This also applies\nto the cover defence but this, though tight for most of the game, fatally-wilted and fell away in the final tea minutes.\ntoo many penalties\nA match which throughout was typically exciting Cup rugby opened at a furious pace which both sides\nwe ie forced to slow. Then came the\nstream of penalties then after fifteen\nminutes U.C. toon the lead with an easily kicked goal. During this\nperiod Riley had one good run but\nU.C.' s fast moving backs were always threatening.

This\nwas purchased by the Electrical Department\nfor \u00a33,500, just about half the cost of the\nc of ered walk-way between the mechanical\nand electrical blocks.\nA language laboratory consists of a set of t ne recorders in soundproof booths. One student sits\nin each booth and listens to a tape playing selected\nphrases and sentences in the foreign language. He tien attempts to record the sound which he has\nheard on his own track of the tape recorder. He may then play the tape back and hear any mistakes\nwhich he is miking. The teacher sits at a central\nconsole from which he may switch into any of the\nbooths and control the work of the student.\nb sim u.ia neo us classes in different languages\nnow possible\nThere is no need for the students to be studying the same language, and all can go at their own speed. Spectacular results have been claimed for\nteaching by means of language laboratories. It is\nasserted that by using well prepared tapes under\nthe supervision of an expert a new language may be taught in three weeks up to a conversational\nlevel. When used on its own, learning in a language laboratory is very similar to the way in which babies learn. This is because it is all done Photo: T.

Laboratory being used by second\nengineers as part of their course\nyear\nIn the program of nontechnical studies which is part of the course for second year engineers the\nstudents from the Electrical and Mechanical Departments have a Russian language option. They spend one hour per week in the laboratory which is\na third of the total time devoted to language study.\nThe laboratory has had one term's experimental use. Mr. Ru ten berg, alec tu \u00bber in the Electrical Engineering Department is doing the teaching. He is able to say that he is pleasantly surprised by the\nprogress made this year.\nHope that three language option can bt\noffered to second year in future\nThe laboratory is also being used by some of\nthe other language classes in the college, but the\npresent lack of trained staff means that it is. imp os i'i ble to use the laboratory fully. It is hoped\nthat it will be possible to offer a choice of three\nlanguages to the second year students in1966/7 and to expand the courses offered to other members of the college. It is also thought that the\nlaboratory might be of use in helping overseas\nstudents with their conversational English at the\nbeginning of their courses.\nJ. Caws on. Photo:1.

    "content": "FELLX 5\nYou bl wo gt SIR, As a\" foreigner\" in this\ncountry( and one who intends\nto go back) I have often been\nhard put to understand English behaviour and customs. How ever, I was quite astounded to\nhear in a conversation at a Hall dinner, \" Oh,S...., that's where all the wo gs are ! \"\nThe term\" wo g\" is accepted\nto be derogatory and insulting, i.e., if one wants to score over a foreigner, one usually has only to say, \" You b l....w og!\" In these hard times of racial understanding, I find it most\ndepressing that supposedly\nhigh lv educated people in this\ncountry use such language\n(consciously or even unconsciously). Therefore, I should like to make a plea that gentle-men of this College refrain from using such terms which are designed to create racial ill feeling.\nAt the danger of being accused of being a racial warmonger, I should like to remind people here that there are many thousands of English people abroad and that racial tolerance will be of benefit to both parties.\nANTI WO G.Ed. \u2014 Might it not be advantageous for COCO NATS \u2014 the Coordinating subCommittee for National Societies\u2014to hold a forum on the subject ?\nPoor old\nSennet\nSIR, Tim Doe, late News Editor of F EL DC, in the last issue accused SEN NET of being short\nof news.\nThis has been one of my complaints against this paper\never since I began studying it weekly after joining the FELIX Staff at the beginning of last\nterm. It seems obvious tome that the Editors of that illustrious newspaper have the ut most difficulty in collecting\ncopy.\nToo much of the paper is\nfilled up every week with bor ine, poorly written material that\nhas little place in what is, after\nall, the newspaper of the University of London Union. For example, the reviews\nA non-ideal situation\nThe recent fuss about FELIX' s anonymous columnists left\nme rather cold, although reading rubbish or unimaginative comment is probably less distasteful when authorship is concealed.\nHowever, the fact remains that we have two people straining their limited intelligence to produce the dull material which regularly fills a considerable part of FELIX' s centre pa'ges. Two results follow. Firstly, that FELIX' s readers are bored, and secondly that potentially better material is excluded. For instance,\nthe Holy Huddle was refused a regular in FELIX on the grounds\nof lack of space. No doubt the newly formed Political Council could also be persuaded to make a regular contribution. In my opinion, these two sources, each representing large sections of the Union, and each having something to say, should be\nused to replace one or( better) both of the present columnists, whose work is after all largely an inferior and often fatuous duplication of the editor's column. ALANG ADD( Chairman of Anglican Chaplaincy). page is completely u necessary. I prefer to read the experts in the national newspapers who make an accurate (or near-ac-curate) appraisal of the quality of a film and the actors. The SEN NET reviewers appear tp\nknow as little about the theatre\nand the film industry as most of\nthe readers. Who really reads\nthe reviews when considering which show to see ?\n\" Penny Newland is atypical member of SEN NET staff; K<j< NTU!\nhardworking, conscientious.\nThis she may be, but she is\nalso boring, un talented and little read. This I think is not so much a function of Miss Newland, who may well be\nvery talented, but a function of\nthe material she plays with. The Carnaby Street complex of SEN NET has been rearing its\nugly head in almost every issue;\nthe authors of the fashion art i cles have shown themselves out\nof touch with their subject\nmatter.\nThis appears to be the crux of the trouble \u2014 the material used by SEN NET. Goodness knows, there is enough going on within this University of\nours. Life is interesting, it is\nexciting, and University years\ncan be some of the most exhilarating! So why doesn't the organ of the Union reflect\nthis verve for life?\" You can write for SEN NET\" says a little caption in the newspaper ; well, I for one don't wish to be associated\nwith a paper that is grovelling for something to say and is\nsaying it badly. The material is there, the\nwriters to comment on the material are there \u2014 but when, when will they both meet ?\nPETE WALL UM.M in. Tech. II. Ed. \u2014 At least you were spared\nthe bother of readingS EN NET last week, cancelled to prove,\nno doubt, that some colleges\u2014\nnot IC \u2014 were\" Guilty of murder.\" Unfair!\nSIR, Your criticism of Maths Soc in the last edition of FELIX is\nmost unfair. The notices advertising Professor Bond i's talk\nwere clearly marked\" post-pone d\" after discussion of the\nmatter with him on the Friday before the talk.\nProfessor Bondi will talk in stead on March14. DAVID BRANNAN, President, Maths Soc.\nLoans\n\" Students of Imperial College vote unanimously against any proposed loans system,\" was the essence\nof the reports in the papers the day after the last\nUnion Meeting. And to most people it would seem quite clear that I. C.had in fact voted virtually unanimously. But had they? Certainly all those\nwho attended voted for action to be taken, but it\nwas stressed from the chair that it was most important for each person to actually take action having voted for this course. However, since the\nconcert hall was barely full, some 8 0 per cent of\nthe students didn't bother to make the journey up to the Union. How many of these will make an effort and go to Westminster? It is doubtful whether half of those present will go, let alone\nthe vast majority who were too apathetic. But to\nsay that the vote was unanimous is rubbish if you take a person's absence as a mark of disagreement\nwith the motion on the floor. Surely a referendum\nwould have been more accurate, and stimulated\nmore general interest?\nThe Smoking Concert\nThose of you fortunate enough to have seen a Union Handbook will find, on Page 17, a description of the delights one may expect to find at the\nR.C.S, Smoking Concert.\" A cast drawn from almost every department of R.C.S., and approximating in size to the size of the audience results\nin a continuous series of hilarious sketches liberally spiced with audience participation.\" From this\ndescription one might have expected an enjoyable\nevening of\" Union meeting stuff\" or possible better\nthan that, one always lives in hope. However, the\nevening did not turnout quite as expected. True I got a free pint, and took part, as one of the\naudience, in saying\" OY\" three times. The rest\nof the evening was spent enduring a series of\ndisgusting and degrading jokes and sketches which were neither subtle nor funny. This surely must\nhave been the worst Smoking Concert in living memory, and one for which the organising Committee should be thoroughly ashamed. One might expect some sense of responsibility, even in this\nCollege, when bawdy entertainment is being sur-v eyed. It has its place, but must be subject to the\nsame considerations of quality that operate in respect of other concerts and cabarets. One would hate to advocate censorship, but if the College's good name is to be brought info disrepute by such\ngross irresponsibility, then its use is obvious.\nThat lot again\nHaving criticised these gentry before for their\ndrunkenness, it makes a welcome change to be able\nto congratulate them on their achievements, in the\nname of I. C.,up to the time of writing. To any casual onlooker, it may seem that their journey\nto the final of the Gut te ridge Cup was effortless.\nCertainly not, why This week, they're all drinking orange juice which must be a severe blow in itself.\nSince by the time you read this the result will be\nknown, I will make no prediction, but I hope at\nleast a large number of you went down to support\nthem.

Applications were received from40 per cent of undergraduates and15 per cent of post graduates. This shows a wide discrepancy with the Rector's survey\ntwo years ago from which it appeared\nthat 75 per cent of undergraduates\nand 50 per cent of Po' u wanted to\nlive in Hall. On the basis of this report, the\nsub-committee of Council, set up to\nlook into methods of selection for rooms in Halls of residence has made\nI the major recommendations that the\nnumber of places in Hall for staff\nmembers should be reduced to 19\nfrom25, and that the percentage of residents accepted for a second year\nshould fall to between 15 and20, compared with the present 2 5 .\nThis is because the actual percentage of people in residence for other\nthan their 1st year is 30-35, including Wardens places, Union places, and the\nplaces of Senior Union officials.\nIt is recommended that greater publicity for the Hall application forms and wider distribution of these and the Hall of residence booklet would lead to a larger number of applicants\n(especially from members of staff), and this with more flexibility in the choice\nof residents (ceasing to regard the\nsuggested percentages of the various categories as mandatory) will lead to\nmore, and more suitable people gai ning places in Hall. EXAMINATION TABLES A LIST of formulae may be available for use in examinations in Guilds next\nyear. They will be contained in a booklet which is being prepared by Professor Neal, Dean of Guilds. The Council of Engineering Institutions (C.E. I.) asked Professor Neal to prepare a booklet containing logarithmic, trigonometric, steam and other physical tables and formulae which a student would not be expected to remember, for use in their\nentrance examinations,( the C.E. I, is\na body of thirteen institutions, for example, the Institute of Mechanical Engineers). The examinations are in two parts; Part I is a basic engineering course and is common to all the\ninstitutions; Part II is a series of more specialised papers, each institution requiring a pass in a certain selection,\n(this is equivalent to B. Sc.(Eng.) Part HI). Cambridge University have already\nintroduced a similar list, also prepared\nby Professor Neal, and the Staff of Guilds are in favour of following their example. It will really only affect the Mechanical Engineering Department since the other Departments, with the possible exception of Civil Engineering, do not use such\ntables.\nThe booklet will not be ready by\nthis summer since copyright negotiations have yet to be completed.\nI.

The request to the police for the\nProcession to take place on14 May could hardly have been unexpected.\nNor can January have been particularly short\nnotice. And to have to wait five weeks or so\nbefore being given a flat refusal by the very\npeople to whom the request had been sent in the first place indicates either sheer bad manners or gross incompetence.\nThe last Saturday usually represents the climax of\nCarnival Week. It starts with the procession\nabout lunchtime, continues with\" a garden fe te in the afternoon ( which is insured against\ninclement weather), and ends with a grand\nfinale dance.\nTo bring the Procession forward to the first\nS at tr day would shadow all those other ex-c J!ct events\u2014the Stomp, Hoot e nanny, Intern at ional Evening and Midnight Film Festival\n\u2014 into inglorious anticlimax.

Full details may be found on the\nvarious posters in College and in the \" What' sOn\" column. The production represents a new period for Dram soc. It\nwas presented by the society at\nChristmas1945 and I find in our record book the cryptic comment,\" Play slated by PHOENIX.\" This time we are hoping to do much better\u2014certainly everyone has put a great\ndeal of hard work into the production. Should there be anyone reading this who saw the 1945\nproduction I should be very\ngrateful for their comments in comparing the two productions \u2014 if, as we hope, they come along and see this one.\nMay I draw the attention of\nyour readers to our party boo kings scheme which offers the\nfollowing reductions :\nParties of10 \u201420 4 / - tickets\nfor 3/6, 3/- for2/6; parties of more than214/ tickets for3/,3/ for2/3. The more observant of your readers will note, for example,\nthat it is cheaper to buy21 tickets than20. I'm sure many other advantageous fiddles can be worked and I shall be only too pleased to advise on the\nmatter. Whether or not you fiddle your way in, the play is\nThat disgusting poster!\nSIR, One word only can describe FELIX' S latest publicity poster \u2014\ndisgusting. Yes, Sir, disgusting (if you pardon the expression).\n1 am extremely appalled that FELIX, a respectable College paper\nof excellent and stable circulation should stoop so low and jnu ck the Union noticeboards with such a cheap little picture \u2014 such as\none sees in soldiers' barracks or in the rooms of sex maniac s!Iam absolutely sick of the increasing exploitation of sex by commercially minded men in society, some of whose techniques\nhave been copied by various publicity officers in the College and your poster is undoubtedly the extreme of such exploitation. I regard this poster as an insult to the students of I.C. Union who are supposedly intelligent, for only those with the minimum of intellect are taken in by such cheap posters. Ido not believe that\nsales of FELIX are falling so alarmingly as to necessitate such\naction. The quality of the paper is definitely improving and the\ncirculation is therefore increasing.\nBesides, the poster does not bear the stamp of the Publicity Officer and its display on the Union noticeboards is therefore\nillegal. Any member of the Union has the right to remove it. Your publicity officer should not be surprised when he discovers\nits disappearance.\nYours, in disgust,\nGEORGE BARA MK I, Physics II. Ed. \u2014 Certainly FELIX' s circulation is rising, but M r.Bara mk i's argument is pure fallacy. Other of his comments I would also\nchallenge, but it's comforting to know that at least someone outside FELIX cares for our image.\nwell worth seeing. Need I add that we would prefer the tickets\nto be actually paid for! Finally, may I mention the\nfact that we are running a competition based on the advertisement in\" What' sOn.\" This contains one simple mistake.\nAnyone who can point this out to me will qualify for one te duce d rate 41- ticket or two rey a riou s reasons this competition is not open to Dram soc members or FELIX staff.\nPHILIP L.

The\nprocession of floats around the\nlocality may not, therefore, take\nplace.\nThis bombshell came only\nminutes after IC Union Secretary\nPhil Dean had announced at the\nUnion Meeting on Thursday, 24\nFebruary, a Red Cross collection in Kensington High Street,\nwhich called on the College to\nprovide volunteers, on 10 May\u2014\nin the middle of Carnival Week.\nThe police explained to Angela Price, the Carnival Week Events Organiser, that only one street collect ion per week could be permitted. Such events, they volunteered, have\nalready been planned for10 and17 May by other bodies. The possibility\nof the procession taking place on the\nprevious Saturday has yet to be investigated. Meanwhile Carnival Chairman Chris Hocking is appealing to the\nHome Office for a reversal of the de-c is ion. The request for the procession to\ntake place on14 May was lodged by\nthe Board in early January. The Chelsea police informed the Board that this request would have to be\ncirculated to other local forces within whose districts the route would pass\nbefore a reply was sent by Scotland Yard. Enquiries on the direction of the\nroute and the usual statement that\nprogramme selling \u2014 and this includes\nthe Carnival magazine \u2014 on the streets\nis not allowed were settled between\nthe police and the Board in the five\nensuing weeks.

    "content": "1,3\nPicasso examined\nCopplestone at General Studies\nDegrees\nQuorate Union Meeting\nwithout debt\nPerhaps the greatest thing\nabout Picasso is his ability to\nchange. Trewin Copplestone began his second talk on 20th century art with a statement \" Picasso realises he is Picasso.\" This\nhas meant that Picasso has been\nable to examine his own work\ncritically, and rapidly, such that\nafter completing a picture in the\nmorning, he has painted a second\nafter dinner \" according to his\nnew mood.\"\nPicasso is having such a love affair\nwith his life that this tremendous\ncapacity for work has meant he is now painter, sculptor, ceramics designer\nand even playwright \u2014 demanding an enormous mental and physical energy.\nHis earliest work, when about 14,\nsimultaneously displayed both an awareness of con tempo ray art and a tremendous freedom. He was influenced by Van Gogh and, when he\nmoved to Paris, Toulouse Lautrec. Again he developed their styles into his own form. When in Paris he was desperately poor, and this reflected in his Blue Period Paintings. These depicted extremely sorrowful looking people, and were painted in melancholic blues. This gave way to his Pink Period \u2014 a time of hope. An interest in people who lead double lives grew; such as the circus people.\nCubism followed. This he called\n\" an intellectual game,\" with no definite rules or goal. Here the picture became f acted, moving surface,\nThis he, and Braque, developed into many different forms, including collage. At times his pictures contained more classical forms. However, his\ngeneral style became expressionist \u2014\nhighly emotionally charged. Animals were introduced, particularly the bull and horse. The bull symbolised power and tyranny, and the horse, suffering.\nAfter being confined to Paris during the war, his paintings expressed primarily happiness. The fawn appeared,\nand doves. These were not only re actions to his own experiences, but to\nthose of the times.\nSince 1955 he has fashioned cera-mic s and sculptures, and reproduced\nmasters in his own form. Although his work at times seems to be abstract,\nPicasso has always referred to the\nreal physical world and it has always\nborn a visible resemble n ce to nature.\nAfter illustrating his talk with slides,\nTre win Copp le stone was officially, and most deservedly, thanked on behalf of\nthe large audience attending by Colin Philips, who sensibly suggested that\nthose present should take advantage\nof the many, and varied, Galleries here\nin London. M.J. Smith Maintaining a balance\nBass and Mitchell s and Butlers have\nprovided a second cold shelf for the\nSouthside Bar. Mr. Mooney has. removed the ice-bucket from the S S bar. Half century for JEZ\nVintage vehicle rally\nA LOT OF talk about less talk\nwas the main feature of the\nUnion meeting on the 24th Feb.\nTwo motions were discussed, with\nno surprising outcomes.\nThe first, proposed by Keith Cavanagh, was that the House should accept the report of the working party\nset up last term to investigate the\nloans issue. It was passed over-w helm ingly. The findings and recommendations of the working party were\nput to the Union by Frank Fuchs. These recommendations were, basically, that as many Union members\nas possible should request ta see their\nMP's on9 th March( today), and put forward their views on the subject of\nloans; and that the Union should do all it can to express its abhorrence of the idea of loans to students.\nA motion from the floor that free\ncoaches should be provided to take\nstudents to Westminster was passed\nby a large majority. The second motion was that this\nmeeting accepts that the President of\nI.C.U. should be elected by the Union as a whole, and calls on Council to\nset up a working committee to investigate the best means of bringing this\ninto effect.\nThis was proposed by David Live sey. who subjected his audience to\na five minute harangue, and who was\n: c used by the oppose r, Keith Guy, of advocating change \" for change's sake alone.\"' Mr. Live sey c: aimed that\na lot of the apathy in the College was\ndue to the present system of electing\nthe President, but Mr. Guy maintained that the apathetic section of the College would then sway the vote, and they would only know the candidates\nwho nie fools of themselves at various fu ' :t ions. Mr. Dougal McCrea th. an exPr e; ident at r Canadian University, said\nthat in ais experience the open vote\nsystem was not a good one. Mr. R is mon d had gained the impression\nthat the constituent College Fresidents\n(who sit on Council) were elected for their clowning about at Cc n st it. Union Meetings, and these were the sort of\npe op' e the Union entrusted with the\nelection of the President of I.C.U. The motion was defeated by209 votes to 77 with14 abstentions.\nKeith Gay opposing\nPhoto: Co'in Harrison X RAY\nA STUDENT Health Unit will be visiting the Health Room(14.

She was given in1955 by Joseph Crossfields of Warrington, where she\nhad been used as a works engine after\nher services with the London Fire Brigade. She has not been running, however,\nfor almost two years \u2014 most people at\nIC have not seen her. The reason\n\u2014 an ailment peculiar to elderly\nvehicles \u2014 big end trouble. On the\nLondon to Brighton run for commercial vehicles in1964, she ran one such\nbig-end, and since then has been\ncompletely rebuilt. The engine \u2014 nine and a quarter litres in four cylinders\n\u2014 was dismantled here, the bear ir jg s recast, and the who' e rebuilt at weekends by members of the RCS Motor Club, at Dennis's factory at Guildford. During this time, the chassis\nand body were stripped and cleaned,\nand repainting started.

Entered are some eight\nother fire engines of varying make and age, other commercial vehicles of interest, and several vintage cars. There will be driving tests for the entrants\n\u2014 which should be interesting considering the age of some of the\nmachines. We hope that some of 1C will be sufficiently interested to come and watch.\nPaul Ward Geigy\nColours and chemicals for industry\nGraduates who join Geigy find that we keep\nthe personal touch. We can do this because\nour working units are relatively small. Yet\nGei gy is a worldwide organisation, making\nand selling colours and chemicals for the\ntextile, paint, paper, plastics, lubricants and\nother industries, as well as pharmaceutical\nspecialities. So the smallness is not restricting,\nsince we enjoy the benefits of pooled resources,\njoint basic research and the international\nexchange of knowledge and experience.\nSecurity need not mean stagnation: Gei gy( founded in 1 7 5 8 ) is proud of its past, but does\nnot live in it. Our textile chemists have recently\ndeveloped new techniques for the continuous\ndyeing of acrylic fibres, wool and nylon. Our pigment laboratories pioneered the stir-in\ncolours for do-it-yourself household paints. Our\nspeciality esters form the basis of the synthetic\nlubricants used in most jet aircraft in this\ncountry, and we are at present working on the\nproblems of supersonic aircraft lubrication.\nThere are also openings for arts and economics graduates with training facilities in most aspects\nof our work. Salaries, pension arrangements\nand other conditions are good.

Further to this a second\nrep. should be elected from each year\nto be concerned solely with the academic interests of students. These\nreps, would not sit on the Committee. The reps, would be available for\nany duty that I.C. Executive wished\nthem to fulfil, unless they were preoccupied with Constituent College duties, and I.C. Clubs would be able\nto make use of them on certain oc-cas ions. It has also been proposed that\nsecond year reps be responsible for the first years as well until the Easter\nterm. This would result in better\nfirst year reps., since by then the\nFreshmen would have got to know one another.

On the other hand the completion of the ACE extension in about\nMay will release about fifty to sixty\nnew places. Also during the summer about fourteen places will become available at the back of the Bio chemistry building and another twenty-nine will be released in the north-east\nquadrangle.\nWhen work starts on the NewHall about twenty places will be lost from opposite Weeks in order to provide access for the contractors.

The remaining parts of the Imperial Institute building will be removed, and the lower parts of the Tower thus exposed will be faced with Portland stone from the original quarry. The Institute was originally built 'as a museum to house relics of the\nBritish Empire, and later became the\nCommonwealth Institute. The276 ft.\nTower was built as a memorial to the\nJubilee of Queen Victoria, hence the\nname. It is also sometimes referred\nto as Col cut t Tower since there is a plaque in the Tower giving the name of the Architect \u2014 Col cut t., The Tower contains a peal of ten bells, known as the Alexandra Peal, which is the property of the Queen. The bells are rung on official Royal occasions, and on suitable domestic\noccasions at the discretion of the\nRector( e.g. Commemoration Day, Charter Day). The bell-ringers are\nthe Ancient Society of College Youths, under the leadership of, Mr. W. J. Rawlings. When the operation has been\ncompleted the area around the Tower will be landscaped to fit in with the\nground areas around the other new buildings.\nR.J. M.

SKIING\nMINERS\nDICKIE GASH and Jim Edmond, both3 rd year Mining Engineers, last\nmonth spent one week as the guests\nof the Leoben School of Mining at\ntheir Winter Seminar held at Zella m See in Austria. Students of10 nationalities were present and it afforded\nexcellent opportunities for these\nstudents to meet and talk with one\nanother over innumerable glasses of Austriaiu \" Bier.\" A series of lectures were given\nduring the early part of the evenings\nbut these did not mar the enjoyment\nof the visit! The daylight hours were\nspent on the local ski slopes under the\nguidance of some bf our Austrian hosts. Skiing is a sport which dem and s a higher degree of physical fitness than was present in the two R.S. M. representatives and getting out of bed the next morning was always\na painful process (perhaps it was not entirely the results of skiing though!)\nThe Seminar as a social event was a great success and it was felt that\nsuch circumstances could hardly be\nimproved upon for building up good relations between students of different\nnationalities. It is to be hoped that\nmore and more Colleges will organise\nsuch functions. There is nothing like a few rounds of beers for getting a friendly international exchange of\nviews! \u2022\nJ. M.E.&R. G. Kuenun at Mines\nSymposium\nON Tuesday the 1st of March the Dela Heche Club, the club of the Ge ology Department, held a whole day symposium on\" The Mechanics of Transport and Deposition of Sediments.\" This was open to all members\nof the geology and associated depart-ment s, as well as to invited guests\nfrom other London colleges. Due to restrictions of space we were not able\nto accommodate as many visitors as\nwe should have liked, and attendance\nwas limited to150. The morning was spent discussing\nobserved features of various types of sediments and their environments,\nwith speakers from the Ministry of Defence, the National Institute of Oceanography and the Hydrology Research Institute as well as those\nfrom the University. After a break for lunch, the after-noon session dealt mainly with experimental sedimentology, with a series\nof descriptions of very elegant ex per iT 'hoto : Co'-'n Harrison men tsv in tanks of various shapes and sizes. The highlight of the day was the lecture, illustrated by cine films\nof his experiments, given by Professor\nKuen en of the University of Gr on in gen in the Netherlands. Prof. Kuen en was the originator of experimental\nmethods of sediment o logical investigation, and is still one of the leaders in this field.\nAll the lectures and discussions\nserved to show even more clearly the\nimportance of correlating field observation with laboratory experiment\nwherever possible, but also highlighted\nthe difficulties encountered in behaviour of their prototype. Probably because a large number of the people\npresent were specially concerned with problems of sedimentology, every\ncontribution sparked off as eines of\ncomments and questions which made\nthe day a very lively and useful one.\nC.A.L egg.

F. Gibson\nI.C. qualified for the second round of the\nMelville-Smith trophy when beating a North\nLondon team by 10 imps (international\nmatch points) in a close, keenly contested,\nmatch. This competition differs from most\nof the other national events in that it is a ruling that no more than a third of the hands\nmay be played by the same partnership.\nTwo substitutes are allowed but generally,\njust one team of four operates, each player\nplaying ten hands with the other three\nplayers in turn, with the match being decided\non thirty hands.\nThis particular opposition had the scalps of a leading international team to their credit from an\nencounter the previous week, and they went into the match full of confidence, which may well have been responsible for their ultimate undoing. Certainly, their bidding was at times distinctly optimistic, as can be judged from one of the earlier hands.\nDealer South \u2014 Love all. SQ8 H4D Q109542C9853 SK J1062 H8753D7 CK42 SA974H96 DJ63 CA Q107S53 HAK Q J102 DAK8 CJ6 In both rooms, South opened with a standard\nA col2 H bid( showing 8 playing tricks with hearts\nas trumps), and North gave the negative response\nof 2 N.T., the opposition remaining silent. South has no additional features in his hand over and above those he has already shown on his opening bid, except six hearts, so the only sensible course\nopen to him would appear to be to bid3 H, which North must pass on his weak holding. This is\nwhat actually happened at the table, where\nI.C. were s it tin?. North South, and after an opening lea i of the Di'.m on d seven from West, declare r had no difficulty in wrapping up 12 tricks.\nOur days in this competition ap near to be numbered, however, for in the next round, we have\nbeen drawn against last year's eventual winners,\nwho included, from time to time, such players as\nReese, Flint, Kon stam, and Pri day in their team.\nIn this event, the normal tactics adopted are to\npreserve the most experienced partnership for the final session, and to open with the most inexperienced. It is my own personal opinion that\nwhen the dice are heavily loaded against one team\n(as will certainly be the case with us in the next\nround), it might be sound policy to reverse the\nprocedure. Ti is would entail opening with the\nstrongest part nr ships, endeavour ing to establish\nan early lead against relatively inexperienced\ncombinations, which might induce the oppositions\nlater partnerships to over-reach themselves in try-ing to pull back the lead. It seems to be the only\nway that we stand any chance at all against such\nredoubtable opposition. At the other table, however, South made the\nvery ambitious call of 3 N To yer partners negative\n2 NT hoping that partner would hold stops in both the black suits or, failing that, the opp osi tion would mutilate the defence being inexperienced in partnership (as was the case in the first\nsession). Whilst it was true the defence missed\na trick when the club suit was blocked, nevertheless eight tricks were taken after an opening spade\nlead from East for a score of 200 to EW. With a score of 230 to NS at the other table, this gave\nI.C.a swing of 430 ordinary points, corresponding\nto 10 imps, which was exactly equal to the ultimate\nvictory margin. It is interesting to note that\nSouth will almost certainly succeed in making4 H( although he can lose four top black suit tricks),\nfor West is most unlikely to lead away from a King. Furthermore,6 H may well be made if bid, for by the same arguments, a black suit is unlikely to be led, unless East uses a Light ner double,\nwhich for aslam contract calls for an unusual\nlead.\n\n"
