    "content": "Letters\n.Sir\nMay I lake this opportunity lo\nprotest most strongly about contentious material in this year's ICU Freshets' Handbook.\nContained within, as I discovered\nalter seeing page pro ol s at the\nprinters, are the most vicious\nattacks on Victor Mooney Captain Lindley and Lord Flowers I have seen to date.\nWhile agreeing with the broad\nsentiments express et lI feel they\nare grossly overstated. Moreover,\nit is a disgrace that such contentious comments will be foisted\nupon a very impressionable fresher intake. Never before has a \u2022Union publication sought to\ninfluence opinions in such an\nobvious manner prior to term!\nIt is perfectly understandable\nthat such a situation should occur. Paid Donovan, the Handbook Editor, is a first year student and has, perhaps, become a little carried away by\nthe vindictiveness and malice shown towards Mr Moone y and\nCapt Lindley that was prevalent\nin the FELIX Office last year.\nThe (anonymous) author of the\narticle is none other than Patrick\nColl,e x FELIX News Editor.\nSoured by his recent maths failure he has sought to \"go out\nwith a bang\", to use his own\nwords. But the one factor that is\nbeyond my comprehension is\nthat Mr N Morton, ICU President, has told me that he had\nseen the Handbook and approved\nof it. While not encouraging Presidential intervention in an\neditorial matter. I wonder how\nhe could possibly approve of\narticles that are sure to incense\nthe College and are extremely\nunfair to the individuals con-cern ed, in that no right ol reply is\noffered.\nBearing in mind that the\nCollege has kindly agreed to mail\nout the Handbook to fresher s.Iam surprised that Mr Morton, who has overall responsibility for\nUniort matters, and. of course,\nthe Handbook, should consider\nthe matter so unimportant.\nYours faithfully\nSteve Marshall\n.Sir \u2022 '\nI am obliged to you for showing\nme a letter from one S Marshall,\nan illustrious honorary life member of ICU. Typically, he\nhas twisted facts and comments\nto his own end. He implies that\nMr Patrick Coll has written articles about Messrs Lindley and Mooney when we all know\nMr Marshall himself is responsible for this entire campaign.\nHowever, I shall not dwell on Mr Marshall's low journalistic and\nmoral standards as these are well-known.\nMy position on the Handbook\narticles in question is quite clear\u2014I have not seen them. It is\ntrue that Is aw most of the\nHandbook at paste-up stage and\ngave an unofficial no dol approval. However, the articles on our good friends in College were not\navailable and it completely slipped my mind to ask the\nHandbook Editor if he was\nhiding any contentious, abusive\nmaterial from my all-pervading\nself. Silly me. I must take full\nresponsibility for this dreadful\noversight. I am only sorry that\nMr Marshall did not draw my\nattention to these articles as I am\nreliably informed that he was\noccasionally seen in the FELIX Office when the Handbook was\nbeing prepared.\nAs the person finally responsible lor all Union affairs I am\ncertain to be the recipient of irate\nphone calls when the Handbook\nreaches the Sheriield Building.\nNaturally I will deal with such\ncalls in my normal diplomatic\nmanner.\nI look forward to an informed\nand informative FELIX this\nyear.\nl ours faithfully\nNick Morton ICU Hack Ed's Note: I thought it only fair\nto give the President, Nick Morton, the right of reply to Mr Marshall' s letter ( considering there is not another FELIX until\nOctober). This prompted the\nabove reply.\nOn further consideration, the\nPresident decided to approach\nCaptain Lindley, informing him of the offending articles. Word also reached the Rector(who had\nwritten the foreword to the\nHandbook) and he made it quite\nclear that College would not mail\nit out if these articles were included. Printing has been stopped and the articles will not\nappear.\nIam certain that College would\nhave looked carefully anyway.\nWhat their reaction would have\nbeen is a matter of speculation.\nDear Sir\nI feel I am voicing the feelings\nol many when I say how disgusted\nI was by the obnoxious behaviour\nof some people on the recent\nCambridge day-trip. Indeed. I am forced to the conclusion that\nsome of the people on the outing\nonly went to get drunk.\nLet me point out some of the\ndeficiencies in the actions of the\nringleaders which1111er1 y disgraced this Union. Firstly, some people arrived late al the\ncoach. This was completely indefensible. Secondly, when in\nCambridge, many of the group\nspent most of their lime at a \"Beer Festival\" when they could\nhave been admiring the aesthetic\nbeauty of Cambridge's marvellous architecture. These points,\nwhich would condemn the participants for evermore, pale\ninto insignificance when compared with the most disturbing\naspects of the trip.\nI refer, ol course, to the singing\noi callously crude and indecent\nsongs.\nII any ol the intent ions outlined\nin these songs were, heaven forbid, to take place, then the\nparticipants would surely lease\nthemselves open lo charges of\nindecent exposure, assault, and\ninciting racial hatred, to name\nbut four. (I don't stand and count\n'em.)\nThere can be no excuse lor this\nbehaviour. I cannot help asking if\nthose people would have behaved\nin the same way il their mothers\nwere present. Indeed, you yourself, sir, were on thai coach\nand I have no doubt thai you\nwere one of the instigators. Fie on\nyou, you brazen faced male factor.\nI was delighted to see though,\nthat our glorious sabbaticals Were\nnot on this trip; there is still some\nhonour left in this institution.\nFinally, I call lor the abolition\nof this trip, otherwise, the\nextreme consequences of further\ntrips would be an abominable\ncorruption, which would result\neven in civilised institutions, such\nas this college, adopt ng the\nbarbarous customs of certain savage tribes.\n1 ours faithfully\nPercy Allingbrookc- Bogle\n.S'i'rI am not one to write reams of\nmeaningless drivel just to get my\nname in FELIX but, this time I feel I really must make an exception and put pen to paper.\nSeriously, in all my time at IC I have never been so shocked, nor\nso annoyed by what is going on.\nI thought that there must be\nsome integrity left in the students\nof today but apparently there is\nnot so much as one grain of\ncommon sense or decency in any\none of them.\nIt is a far cry from my first days\nat university when students were\nlooked upon as responsible, upstanding citizens who, if at times\na little boisterous, were at least,\ngenuinely trustworthy people.\nNot so today! It was only recently that the true depravity\nto which students at IC have\nfallen was brought home to me in\na fashion which left me speechless\nwith disgust. Therefore Iam impelled to write this let tor in the\nhope that perhaps some of your\nreaders will pull their socks up.\nTours sincerely\nCAl u card Real name and address supplied.\nDear Readers\nLetters are required for this\npage.

    "content": "HaiJbti Fowtlti OdttCggpjg\nHi, guess tu ho's back again in charge of\nexposes, scandals, caustic comments and\nwry wit? Mr Smith has wisely decided to\nlet me continue casting my eye over some\nof the more unusual and amusing aspects\nof College life. For this issue, however, I thought it only right to commemorate the\nglorious wedding of our future King by\npresenting a few of my own observations.\nWlm aiJ keT gg IT is reported that half a million people\nattended the firework display in Hyde Park on\nthe eve of the great day. What a pity that most\nof them bought their cars with them to fill the\nstreets around College with a near stationary\nmass for hours after it was all over. Fortunately not everybody had to endure the\ncrowds. The Rector, College Secretary and a few bright sparks from the Union, along with\nsome friends and family, had the foresight to\ngo up the Queen's Tower to watch the\nfrivolity. Good for them! I naturally avoided\nsuch a move after reading that at a similar\ndisplay in 1746, one man was killed by falling\nout of the tree from which he had chosen to\nview the fireworks. Do you realise how high\nthe Queens Tower is?\nHOW many of you noticed that there was not'\na Union Jack flying from the flagpole on the\nUnion Building on the great day? It appears\nthat the Union doesn't even possess a flag. Are\nthere no true patriots left at this College? Why,\nif I'd noticed sooner I would have run my\nUnion Jack underwear up as a substitute! 1\nIkflMqtctJack\nIT APPEARS that there is at least one loyal\nsubject in the Union. Honorary Secretary\nMaro Ledwold has not only one, but two\nUnion Jacks in his room. WhurI'm surprised\nthat he didn't dash out and^ un one up the\nflagpole himself.\nBEAUTIFUL Lady Diana Spencer has quite an\namazing family tree. Through her mother she\nis related to no fewer than eight American\nPresidents (not including the present one,\nthank goodness) as well as Humphrey Bogart\nand General Patton.\nBut the biggest surprise is on her father's side of the family. It turns out that Private\nBV BB WolffG \u00a3Ve's columnist Auberon Waugh is her fifth\n\" cousin and editor Richard Ingrams her second\ncousin once removed. Well fancy that! Perhaps Private Eye's novel is ation of the Royal\nRomance, Born to be Queen, is nearer to the\ntruth than you might first expect.\nTmm pah\nHAVING MENTIONED Born to be Queen, I must say I found the serial is ation very funny. The romance between Prince Charles\nand lovely doe-eyed Lady Diana Spencer is\ntold in hilarious style by Sylvie Krin and has\nnow been published in a book, priced at only\n95p. We follow the tense drama of the\ncourtship, the inevitable photographers, the\nintrusion of step grandmother Barbara Cartland and much more.\nWhile this book was at number ten in the\nbest-selling books list during the wedding\nweek, the number one proved to be another\nsurprise. It wasn't the official Royal Wedding\nSouvenir, but the satirical publication Not the\nRoyal Wedding, a send-up produced by John\nLloyd and Sean Hardie which features the\nteam from Not the Nine O 'Clock News. This is\npacked with irreverent humour which mildly\nlampoons the Royal couple. It's good to see\nthat even our most prestigious oc as ions bring\nforward touches of well-groomed humour.\nMY EYES nearly popped out of their sockets\nwhen I read a recent article in The Grauniad\nconcerning the American President, Ronnie\nRaygun. Apparently there is a strong rumour\nin the West Coast radical press over there that\na sort of constitutional figurehead, similar to\nthe Queen, may be introduced to relieve the\npressure from the President. Surprise, surprise, Nancy Raygun is keen to put her and\nold hop along up as candidates in the suggested\nnational poll by which such a position would be\nelected.\nNow this leads on to the Royal Wedding and\nNancy's visit. It has caused quite a stir that the\nAmerican first lady has out rightly refused to\ncurtsey to anybody (a Very strange thing for\nthe wife of an elected representative to do!)\nand it seems that she is very keen to pick up all\nthe tips on etiquette from our own Royal\nFamily.\nCan you imagine it\u2014King Ronald the first!\nNo wonder they tried to shoot him.\nStupid Stmvmim\nONE THING that won't be missed following\nthe great event are the piles of ridiculous\nsouvenirs which one has to wade through on\narriving at any shop. Have you seen those\nrevolting tea towels, the pictures on which\nlook more like Joe Bugner and Dandy Nichols\nthan our own Prince and his bride?\nThe worst item that I have come across is\nthe Royal Wedding Frisbee\u2014good heavens\nwhatever will they think of next!\nSomeone tells me that there is actually a Royal Wedding Rubik's Cube, with pictures of\nthe happy couple.\nTOP MARKS must go to the recently re-opened Scala Cinema at Kings Cross for a witty piece of\nprogramming. On the opening day in their new premises, which was formerly an ape house, they\nbilled King Kong with Mighty Joe Young. Furthermore, as their contribution to the Royal Wedding\nthey had a double-bill consisting of The Bride of Frankenstein and / Married a Monster from\nOuter Space. Well done!\nPage 6 FELIX, August 7, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "After a relatively quiet period July was a good month for the cinema, with several\nvery interesting releases.\nOne of the best is John Boorman' s Excalibur, a fanciful adaptation of the legend\nof King Arthur and the Knights of the Round\nTable. The plot is a combination of many\nthemes; Uther Pendragon uses Merlin, the\nwise magician, to enable him to seduce\nIgrayne, wife of the Duke of Cornwall. Merlin's price is the baby that is thus conceived, who is\nraised without knowing his parents. Arthur\neventually becomes King and brings peace and\nprosperity to the land, but his half-sister,\nMorgana, is up to no good and Arthur must\ndefeat the evil Mordred before the 2hr20 minutes is up. Needless to say, Guenevere,\nLancelot, Gawain, er al crop up along the way\nto add to the excitement, but Nicol Williamson's Merlin is particularly enjoyable. There is an\nexciting mixture of romance, battle and sorcery which adds up to a highly entertaining\nand colourful epic.\nTrailing a little way behind is Ken Russell's Altered States, which I found disappointing\n(not least because of the banal \"love conquers\nall\" ending). There is no doubt that Russell has\nproduced a marvellous combination of images\nand sound which has moments of sheer\nbrilliance. It is just about possible to swallow\nthe plot; gifted scientist Edward Jessup believes that he can unlock previous experiences from the genetic structure of his\ncells by the use of powerful hallucinogenic\ndrugs and sensory deprivation. He is staggered\nto find that an actual physical metamorphosis\naccompanies his mental regression and he\neventually reaches back to the actual moment\nof creation in his relentless search for an\n\"ultimate truth\". This wild premise is well\nexecuted, with some marvellous hallucination\nsequences and brilliant makeup by Dick Smith. What I find hard to believe is that\nRussell sells out at the finale, and opts for such\na clich ed anti-climax for his end sequence. A great pity that such an imaginative film falls at\nthe final hurdle\u2014it could have been a classic.\nIf you want to take your family to an unusual\nand funny film, then Terry Gilliams's Time\nBandits would be ideal. Six dwarves steal a map of the universe from the Supreme Being\n(Ralph Richardson) and proceed to travel\nthrough space and time committing daring\nrobberies. Along the way they pick up a young\nboy, Kevin, whose wardrobe happens to be\none of the holes that the dwarves use to flee\nthe per suing Supreme Being. Together they\nencounter Napoleon, Robin Hood, King Agememnon and eventually Evil himself in the\nFortress of Ultimate Darkness. It's a fast\nmoving children's fantasy which is strangely\nappealing to adults as well. John Cleese makes\na brief appearance as a terribly polite and\nphil an troph ic Robin Hood which will stick in\nmy mind for a long time. A good family film.\nMy favourite release is undoubtedly Steven\nSpielberg's Raiders of the Lost ArU, another\nfamily film. Harrison Ford stars as Dr Indiana\nJones, an archeologist who specialises in\nfinding hidden treasures in dangerous locations. The year is 1936 and when American Intelligence discover that Hitler is on\nthe trail of the legendary Ark of the Covenant\n(in which the original Ten Commandments\nwere kept), they send Jones to beat him to it.\nHitler believes that any army which carries the\nArk before it will be invincible and has set\nJones' arch rival, Belloq, the task of recovering\nit from the lost city of Thannis.\nWhat ensues is a well paced action adventure story, in which Jones always\nmanages to narrowly clear the hurdles presented to him by Hitler' s fanatical henchmen. I think that Jones is cast from a similar mould to James Bond; a clever and\nhandsome adventurer who single handedly succeeds against tremendous odds. He has\nmore human qualities than the ever-slick\nBond however, and will undoubtedly re appear\nin a sequel. The one failure of the film is that it\nnever quite achieves the sense of wonder and\nawe which made the otherwise hollow Close Encounters succeed. In this case, however,\nthe story is tremendously enjoyable and it just\nfails to be the \"Ultimate Adventure\" that the\nadverts promise.\nTalking about James Bond, the latest\noffering For Your Eyes Only is the best of all\nthe recent Bonds. Thankfully there is no\nmassive set piece ending, but a greater\nreliance on really tense, dramatic scenes which\nworks reasonably well.\nThe most disappointing film of the year is\nthe over-hyped Clash of the Titans. This\nturned out to be a dull and uninspired \"boy\nmeets girl, loses girl, gets girl back\" story\nwhich is only saved by Roy Harryhausen's stop-motion animation. Even this does not\novercome the dreary acting and this is\ndefinitely one to miss.\nFinally the Buster Keaton Season at the\nElectric Cinema still has a week to run. This is\na great chance to see some of the funniest\nsilent films ever made by the famous deadpan\ncomic, who is surely one of the most\nunderrated comic talents of the century. Seats\nare only \u00a32 for a long feature and two shorts,\nwhich show at least three times daily. I 'll see\nyou there!\nMark Smith\nArthur draws Excalibur from the stone (above left) and Indiana Jones comes face to face with his\nleast favourite animal (top). Above, Dr. Jekyll goes ape in Altered States and tries to convince\nRosenburg and the marvellously cynical Mason.\nFELIX, August 7, 1981 Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "P.G. Tips\nHello, since this is a postgraduate issue, the\nPresident and the PG Chairman proudly\npresent a joint effort. When the undergrads\nreturn there will be articles about UGC cuts\nand that sort of stuff, but for now a few words\nabout PG s and, more particularly, research\nstudents.\nAt the Board of Studies at the end of last\nterm a proposal was passed that \"writing-up\"\nstudents should pay fees. It seems this is just a recommendation and the matter is still being\ndiscussed. This is obviously a wider problem\nthan just a question of fee-paying. We are,\nonce again, up against the worries of overrunning PhDs( for which IC is now famous)\nand poor supervision. We are extremely\nconcerned about these problems as are plenty\nof other people in College. In the ideal world\nPhD students would have four years sponsorship. Whilst a handful of students are\nin this fortunate position, most are not and\nthere is little chance of establishing an ideal\nworld at present.\nSo let's cut this bullshit and tell you what we\nwant. We want the impossible\u2014comment and\ndiscussion out of you lot. Research students\nhave a reputation for apathy and the response\nto the questionnaire last year was not\nstaggering. Whether or not you wrote in then,\nplease send us any relevant comments you\nhave now. Address them to the President, IC\nUnion, and they will be treated in confidence;\nyou need not put your name to them.\nRemember\nHiroshima\nThirty-six years ago, two atomic bombs were\ndropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The\nresulting horror, devastation and death appalled the people of the world. In Japan,\nsome are still suffering as a direct consequence\nof the attack.\nSince 1945, the world's arsenal of nuclear\nweapons has grown enormously. Following the\nrecent increase in international tension, people\nhave become aware, once again, of how real\nthe threat of nuclear holocaust is. It is hard to\nappreciate the numbers involved. The size of\nthe Hiroshima bomb was about 13 kilo tons (ie\nan explosive power equivalent to 13,000 tons\nof TNT). A bomb now would typically be\nbetween 1 Megaton and 5 Megatons; that is,\nbetween 76 and 385 Hiroshimas. We should\nrealize that all the explosives, all the bombs,\nshells and mines used by all countries during\nthe whole ol World War II amounted to about\n5 million tons of TNT. All that is now concentrated into one typical bomb and there\nare tens of thousands of such weapons.\nWe must all remember the horror caused by\nthose two tiny (by today's standards) bombs\ndropped on Japan. The four days from\nHiroshima Day (yesterday) to Nagasaki Day\n( Sunday,9 August) are set aside for\ncommemoration. A two minute silence will be\nobserved internationally from 11:00 to 11:02am this Sunday. Please respect this. If you would\nlike to wear a commemorative armband with\nthe design show at the lop of this article,\nplease ring Owen Greene on int 2960 today.\nOwen Greene\nYou might like to consider the following\nquestions:\nWill you over-run three years?\nIf so, will you be writing or still doing\nexperimental work?\nIn either of these cases, do you consider it\nfair that you should pay fees?\nWhy do students over-run?\nIs there a problem of selection of suitable\ncandidates for research?\nShould a more comprehensive review of\nprogress be made after one year?\nAre projects too complicated to complete in\nthree years?\nIs there adequate supervision of experimental\nwork, especially in the initial stages?\nIs there adequate supervision of thesis\npreparation, especially regarding timing?\nDo supervisors encourage students to do\nexperimental work right to the bitter end at the\nexpense of writing up?\nIf you have a problem with your supervisor,\nis there anybody in the department you can\nconsult?\nAnd finally, returning to fees, how easy\nwould it be for you to go \"underground\" and\ncontinue beyond three years without registering as writing up?\nBear in mind that the College has suffered a reduction in its estimated budget with the\nUGC letter and is obviously looking to cover\nany drain on its resources be those resources\nmaterial or lecturers' time and energy.\nHeavy article, eh? Sorry, but please\nconsider writing in. Perhaps we can give you\nbetter news soon. On a lighter note, we hope\nthose of you who went on the Cambridge trip\nhad a jolly spiff ing time.\nNicrc and Doug\nBookshop\nNews\nThe Imperial College Bookshop is YOUR Bookshop.

Although final negotiations need to be completed,\nwork should go ahead next week to prepare the building for\nuse in October.\nThe building, situated in Montpelier Street, is very close to College\nand was constructed in 1896. It was used as a nurses home for St\nGeorge's Hospital until 1979 and has since been empty.\nThe property was first put up for sale at Easter and the College's original bid was rejected. Other concerns sought to rc-dev clop the\nprime Knightsbridge site into luxury Hats, but as the building was\noriginally constructed with the money of a generous benefactor, a condition existed that it should remain hostel accommodation. This\nmeant that a second bid from the College was accepted two weeks ago.\ndespite higher offers from business concerns.\nPlans for the hall are still in the very early stages. There has been an\namount of deterioration following two years of neglect and complete\nrefurbishment is necessary before habitation is possible. Some external\nrepairs and communal areas will have a lower priority than the\npreparation of bedrooms and may not be completed until after\nresidents move in.\nAlthough the hall will only be used to house postgraduates, their\noverall number in College residence will only increase in proportion.\nThe hall, situated in Montpelier Street, has not been named. It was\noriginally built due to the benefactions of a Sir Chalres Hall to be used\nas a nurses home.\nThere will be more places available in the current halls and houses for\nfresher and first time applicants as a result.\nAll plans arc in an early stage ol preparation and no del ails about\napplications for places are available al present.\nThis is\nYour Leader\nRemember this face.

Il appears that they\nhadn't even noticed.\nThe penguin is now in the\nUnion Office and no arrangements have been made to return\nit.\nI.C. gets off lightly\nImperial College remains relatively unscathed after the\nUniversity Grants Committee (UGC) distributed the\nGovernment's reduced grant to universities early in July.\nThe country wide effect of the reduced grant levels is that there will\nbe thousands fewer university places available for home students hy\n1984/5. At this College, however, the UGC has recommended that\nstudent numbers are to rise by 170 by 1983/4. Part of this increase will\nbe immediately absorbed by the category change for Greek students,\nwho will be classed as EEC rather than overseas students following\nGreece's entry into the Common Market. The net increase in student\nnumbers will be 122. This means that lor each of the next three years,\napproximately 40 extra students will be taken on. In the forthcoming\nsession this will be distributed as follows: 10 Life Sciences; 5 Chemistry;\n5 Geology; 5 Mineral Resources Engineering;5 Che mEng.5 Computing and 5 to Mee hEng. This increase in students, though, is to occur simultaneously with a decrease in the College's grant. This year the College asked the UGC lor ,\u00a325m, but the grant allocated was just slightly over \u00a323m. Also the\nUGC has provisionally indicated a decrease to \u00a321.6m by 1983/4 at\ntoday's prices.\nThe UGC letter to the University ol London singles out IC for\nspecial treatment. Whilst all the rest of the universities institutions are\nconsidered together, IC is specifically recommended to increase its\nnumbers in the biological sciences. As well as receiving \u00a323.2m of\nrecurrent grant, the College is also given \u00a33.14m for equipment and\nfurniture, \u00a342,000 lor microprocessors and \u00a3\\8,000 lor the Linstead\nextension.\nThe effects of the UGC cut of 14% over the next three years cannot\nbe fully envisaged. As people retire, Ibr instance, they may not be\nreplaced, and the Governing Body at its June19 meeting could not\nrule out the possibility of compulsory redundancies. In the session some\ncuts may be absorbed by slight surpluses from last year. Departments\nmay have to take a2.5% cutback, and the refectory account may have\nto start bearing more overheads, although ICU finances and the\nResidence Account will probably be left alone.\nThe UGC grant makes up 50% of College income: the rest comes\nfrom overseas students fees and outside earnings. These could be\nboosted by having a firm sponsor a professional chair. The College has\nbeen actively seeking funds from outside to boost the UGC grant,\nespecially by setting up interdepartmental sections, eg robotics.\nP.G. trip to Cambridge\nAS IN previous years, the PG Group organised a trip to this year's Cambridge Beer festival. The festival was smaller than the one held\nannually at the Alexandra Palace, but still offered a selection of real ales\nfrom 2b different breweries. The trip afforded an opportunity to look\nround the town, as the festival shut for a while in mid-afternoon, but\npoor weather precluded the traditional punting expeditions. Numbers\nwere down on las l year, and only one coach was taken; this was\npossibly due to the poor weather.\nShop for the\nUnion?\nUNION REGALIA will in future be sold by the Union and\nnot the Bookshop.\nIn July the stocks of regalia in\nthe Bookshop were sold to the\nUnion. The Constituent College\nUnions will sell their own particular items with the rest\nremaining with IC Union. At present the regalia is being\nsold from the Union Office, but\nthe Executive is looking into the\npossibility of starting a Union Shop which will sell other items\nand be run by a permanent staff\nmember.\nNew rooms\nat Silwood\nTHREE NEW residence blocks\nare nearing competition at the\nCollege field station at Silwood\nPark.\nThe buildings will house forty\nstudents and should be ready lor\nuse in October. The building\ncontractors will hand over the\nproperties to the Estates section\nfor final furnishing on August 23.\nAS il wood resident told FELIX that although some of the\nrooms were small, they were a great improvement on the current rooms in William Penny\nHall. U.G. nuisance\nResidents of the College Held\nstation at S if wood Park near\nAscot have again been troubled\nby the behaviour on under graduate held courses.\nAt the end of the summer term\nstudents on an engi eeri ii g Held\ncourse moved ears, tampered with food and ripped a billiard\ntable, which cost the residents\n\u00a355 to repair.\nAS il wood resident told FELIX,\" We live in fear of these\nshort Held courses\".\nCOPY DEADLINE Copy deadline lor the\nFresher s' FELIX is\n5 p.m., Wednesday September23 FELIX, August 7, 1981 Page 3\n\n"

This FELIX may look very\nsimilar to last year's \u2014Iam using up some\nexcess covers on this issue and the main\nFELIX banner will remain the same throughout the year. It is all too easy to\nmake change merely for the sake of change,\nso I intend to try and modify and improve as\nI go along rather than go for a complete\nchange.\nWriting Up Students\nI know very little about the problems of\npostgraduates and the\" writing up\" category. The article on page 4 by the\nPresident and PG Group Chairman includes an appeal for information. It\ndoesn't take much effort to put a note into\nthe internal mail, so I hope that there is a staggering response.\nPostgraduate Hall\nHaving viewed the building in Montpelier\nStreet which the College seems almost\ncertain to purchase, I must say that it is\nquite a find situated just around the corner\nfrom Harrods it is well situated and, although by no means perfect, is in reasonable condition. A lot of hard work is\nneeded to prepare it for habitation and if it is\nready for October there will certainly be a few creases left to iron out. Also, I would\nwait for further details to be posted around\nCollege before bombarding the Student\nServices Office with enquiries.\nSAC\nI couldn't believe that the ceiling of the\nSummer Accommodation Centre Office in\nSouthside was recently painted. This room is a reception area for visitors living in the\nhalls of residence over the summer and is\nempty for about eight months of the year.\nWhy people should be subjected to the\nsmell and mess of paint when it is totally\nunnecessary I don't know.\nHandbook Trouble\nI must say that the reaction to Mr Marshall's letter (page 2) is not surprising. Whilst\nagreeing with some of the sentiments expressed in the offending articles, I cannot\nreally condone the way in which they would\nhave influenced fresher s before reaching\nCollege. When I first saw the articles they\nstruck me as humorous rather than offensive, but in retrospect I can see that\nthey were bound to cause a reaction from\nthe College administration. I only hope that\nthe individual(s) concerned do the decent\nthing and make suitable apologies.\nDramsoc at the Fringe\nYou all have a chance to see the Dram soc offerings for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe\nnext Tuesday (August 11) at 7:30pm in the\nUnion Concert Hall. There is no admission\nfee.\nThe Royal Wedding\nIt warmed the heart to see so many people\nhaving such a great time on July 29. Whilst I found it heard to take any interest in the\ntrivia which commentators padded the day\nwith, I enjoyed the relaxed air which the\nevent inspired.\nFox Farewell\nFormer R CSU and ICU President Chris\nFox is due to fly out to Bolivia as soon as the\npolitical situation over there clears.

All hands will be\nappreciated.\n' Jusf two hours more\nI seem to have spent all my waking hours\nin the FELIX Office this week. The job is\ncertainly a lot harder than it may appear\nfrom the outside and Iam particularly grateful to the following people for their\nhelp: Hector Cameron Clark( especially for\nthe photograph on the cover), Martin, Steve, Dave, Patrick,S hanne( Diamid!)\nDouglas, Nick, Barney, Tim, Matt, Maz& Ian. It won't be long now before scores of\nmusicians (pun intended) set up their week-long vigil on the steps of Albert Hall for that\ngreat national institution, the Last Night of the\nProms.\nThere is great skill involved in this queueing.\nIf you're too near the front of the queue, you\nare committed to several unnecessarily lonely\"\nnights on the pavement, to say nothing of the\ndanger of being trampled underfoot by the\nstampeding mob when the doors are opened,\nthe other hand, if you're too near the back of\nthe queue you may not get a place at the front\nof the hall, and so miss out on the mass\nhysteria, the chance to appear on television,\nand the smell of the conductor's socks.\nTo determine the best place to stand, I tracked down the seven people at the front of\nlast year's queue, and quizzed them about the\norder they were standing in. I elicited five\npieces of information.\nDerrick said: There was at least one person\nbetween me and Suzanne.\nDave said: If I wasn't fourth in line, then\nSuzanne was.\nMartin said: There was exactly one person\nbetween Karen and Derrick.\nBernard said: Martin was somewhere in the\nline between Derrick and myself, but Suzanne\nwas not.\nThe girls said: John was in front of both of\nus, but Dave and Derrick were both behind us\"\nin the queue.\nBut feelings run high, and competition is\nstiff, it seems, for I later discovered that one of\nthe statements is false.\nWhat order did the seven stand in?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o FELIX by 1:00pm on Wednesday 19th August,\nplease. The usual prize of \u00a35 will be awarded\nto the first correct solution opened on that\ndate.\nThe Editor desperately\ntrying to avoid another\nspace-filler.\nHopefully, this space\nwill become smaller\nthroughout the year.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince\nConsort Road, London SW7 2BB(5895111 ext 1048 int 2881) Copyright FELIX 1981.

    "content": "Southside\nSnippets\nTHE COLLEGE has again been\nthe venue for several large conferences,. which take advantage of the Summer Ac como dati on scheme to house their\ndelegates. Conferences ranged\nin subject from Radiation Safety\nto Midwifery. In fact this year\nwas the Centenery of the Royal College of Midwives, and these\nfortunate delegates spent an' evening with Royalty ce'eb rating. THE SUMMER Accomodation\nCentre ( SAC) seems to be one of\nthe few places where anything\nhappens over the summer. So it\nseems strange that it was decided\nto paint the SAC Office ceiling\nrecently when the office was at\nits busiest. Whether this was to\nmake up for the appalling state of\nthe Royal College of Science Union Office, which is nearby\nand has been mistaken for part of\nthe Summer Ac como dati on scheme, remains uncertain.\nTO COINCIDE with the confer-en ces the Imperial College Bookshop managed to stock\nspecialist texts. By advertising the\nfact that these conferences were\nto take place in the newsletter of\nthe Publisher's Association, bookshop manager Mr Roy Hicks was able to get texts from\npublishers on a \"sale or return\"\nbasis. This not only meant that\nvisitors from as far away as the\nFar East and Australia did not\nhave to wait while books were\nordered and mailed, but also that\nbookshop revenue was increased.\nHALL BURSAR Mrs Diana Yarrow was shocked to discover\nthat an old English sheepdog had\nbeen kept in a Keo gh Hall room\nby a visitor. This is, of course,\nagainst Hall regulations.\nTo prevent this happening again she told cleaners to watch\nout lor \" anything unusual, like\nwith four legs or wings.\"\nCONCERN HAS been ex pressed over the way in which\nvisitors to Southside are often\ngiven the wrong keys on arrival\nat the SAC Office. This means\nthat people are given access to\nrooms in which valuable items\nmay have been left by the occupant.\nThe situation is so bad that the\nFELIX Editor, Mr Mark Smith ,\nreturned to his room one day to\nfind a bemused cardiologist who\ncould not understand why he had\nbeen given a room full of clothes\nand books. Captain Lindley, Domestic Secretary, was un available to comment on how\nmany times this mistake had occurred.\nHacks Hacked!\nTHE END OF YEAR examinations provided their usual mixture of\ntriumphs and failures.\nAcademic Affairs Officers did well. ICU A AO Bob Bradley graduated with First Class Honours, as did Mines A AO Pete Bamford.\nRCS A AO, Dave Lyons achieved an Upper Second which secured him a PhD in the Chemistry Department.\nThe incoming C CU Officers normally have more than their share of\nfailures. Guilds seem to have taken the worst of it this year with the\nVice-President, Nick Jenkins, and Publicity Officer, Dave Millet, having failed to qualify. Guilds President Andy Rushton has managed\nto get a place on an MSc course as expected, but as yet has not\nbeen offered a grant and may have to finance it himself. The External\nAffairs Officer and FELIX Business Manager, Patrick Coll, have also\nfailed, which will result in two elections at the start of the next session.\nAll of the sabbaticals managed to satisfy the good academic standing\nqualification. ICU President Nick Morton completed the third year of\nhis PhD course, whilst Deputy President Barney McCabe narrowly\nmissed a Third in \u00a5hy s\\ cs(dip[oma tic Ed). Honorary Secretary Marco Led wold achieved Third Class Honours in Chemistry, and the FELIX Editor, Mark Smith took a Lower Second in Physics.\nFees and Grants\nThe College session al fees for next session, 1981/2 will be as follows:\n1. Home and EEC' students, and those overseas students who began\ncourses before September 1 1980:\nUG s: home \u00a3900; overseas \u00a31,389\nPGs: home \u00a31,320; overseas \u00a31,803\n2.
