As\na cost-saving exercise we\nflew the boats and ourselves\nto Alghero in Sardinia using\nvery cheap Ryanair tickets.\nWe hired a far-too-small Ford\nFocus and stuffed it with kit,\nloading the boats onto an\ninflatable roofrack. We then\nbombed across the top of\nSardinia and caught a ferry\nover to Bonifacio in Corsica.\nWe decided our warm-up\nriver would be the Taravo. We\ngot near to the put-in around\ndusk and followed the road\nuntil we eventually found a\ndecent camping spot to set\nup. After failing to get one\nof the cookers working, we\ncooked our pasta dish on a\nsingle ring. We settled down\nfairly early after a few mugs\nof cheap red plonk with\nthoughts of tomorrow\u2019s paddling strong in our minds.\nFriday 25 March \u2013\nTaravo (by Jim)\nI awoke first, got up and\nstarted to sort stuff out.\nEventually the others arose\nand we breakfasted on\nFrench bread and cheese\nbefore loading the car back\nup and heading to the put-in.\nThe warm-up rapid was\nfine for Patrick and me, only\nto be followed by an upside-down, pretty miffed looking\nChad. Ralph bobbed round\nthe corner wondering what\nwas going on as we reunited\nChad with his kit \u2013 oh well.\nWe paddled on down the\nriver and were beginning to\nwonder whether it would get\nany more interesting when\nwe rounded a corner to\nsee something that needed\ninspecting. The river diverged\ninto three channels, with only\nthe right being inspectable\nfrom the bank. The extreme\nleft looked pretty evil and you\ncouldn\u2019t really see the middle\nchannel.\nBoth the middle and right\nslots were hardly more than\na boat width across, about\n10m long and ended in a 1.5m\ndrop. We decided to give it a\ngo with Patrick being used as\nthe probe while we acted as\nbank support/film crew. He\nran it without hassle and everyone else then went in turn\nwith no problems. The fun\nhad started in earnest!\nOur next obstacle was a\nsweeping turn that looked\npretty nasty. We chose to portage on river right. The rest\nof the river proved great fun.\nA river-wide stopper greeted\nus at one point. We sent the\nprobe through it and watched\nhim being forced to roll, so\nthe rest of us opted to walk\nround.\nChad managed to \u2018swim\u2019 a\ncouple more times, and I was\njust thinking I\u2019d got away with\nit when the river-gods decided to punish me. Upon following Patrick down a series\nof rapids, he decided to wave\nme past for the final \u201cinnocuous-looking\u201d little drop. I got\ncocky and launched over the\ntop of a rock to be welcomed\nby a munchy little hole that\ndecided to play with me. After\nseveral sessions of sky/river-bed antics and about five rolls,\nI ended up against a rockface\nand decided this play-boating\ngubbins wasn\u2019t for the likes of\nme and made a technical exit.\nVery annoying.\nAfter being reunited with\nmy kit, we headed on down the\nremainder of the river. The\nroad bridge soon appeared\nand I removed my wet kit,\nleft the others and headed\nup the road for the shuttle.\nEventually some local farm-er-types picked me up in their\nstandard issue Toyota pick-up\nand were kind enough to run\nme to the car after pretending to understand my pidgin\nFrench.\nAfter picking up the others and the kit, we decided\nto head back south towards\nthe put-in for the Rizzanese.\nUnfortunately, it was dark by\nthe time we got there, and\nmuch faff was had trying\nto find a suitable camping\nvenue. Tents were eventually\nset up and more pasta and\ncheap wine consumed before\nwe dozed off to dreams of 10m\nwaterfalls...\nSaturday 26 March \u2013\nRizzanese (by Ralph)\nAfter our pleasant day on the\nTaravo, we were looking forward to something more on\nthe Rizzanese \u2013 more excite-ment, bigger drops, steeper\ncreeking. We found it.\nEveryone successfully tackled the first rapid, following\nthe overeager probe. After an\nexciting kilometre, we got to a\nnasty 6m fall with rocks in the\nbottom. Everyone instantly\ndecided to walk around it.\nPatrick ran a 2m fall sideways\nhaving mucked up the entry\nrapid, and surfaced partly in\nthe cave behind the fall. A\ngood\u2018Duracell bunny\u2019 impression got him clear. More\npool-drop madness followed\n\u2013 Chad proved that throwing\npeople in at the deep end gets\nresults. We portaged another\n6m fall, then found ourselves\nat the main event, a 2m, 10m,\n3m combination of falls.\nPatrick and I had talked a\nlot about how high 10m actually was, including scaring\nJim\u2019s missus and my mum by\nlikening it to a second floor\nwindow in Beit. Well, 10m is\nvery big. We might have considered it, had the levels not\nbeen high. As it was, no one\nfelt brave/stupid enough for\nthis, and we began a massive portage. It took nearly\nan hour.\nJust when we thought nothing more interesting would\nhappen, Chad provided some\naction. One section had a couple of trees two-thirds of the\nway across. Everyone else\nmade it around them, but\nChad managed to capsize on\nthe rapid, rolling up just in\ntime to fight his way through\nthe branches of the first tree,\nonly to be hit in the chest by\nthe trunk of the second. I\u2019d\neddied out just downstream,\nand lost no time in getting\nonto the bank with a throw-line. Luckily Chad was simply\nwedged on the surface, not\nstuck against the bottom, so\nwas able to pull his deck and\nlet his boat depart without\nhim. I roped him to the side\nand sent him off to find his\nboat, considering bringing a\nchainsaw on our next creek-ing mission.\nWe continued for what\nfelt like many miles, every\nso often shouting \u201cOu est la\nf**king pont?!\u201d Eventually,\nto much rejoicing, \u201cla pont\u201d\nappeared. We sent Jim off to\nrun/hitch the 14km shuttle,\nand stood around feeling cold\nand sorry for ourselves until\nhe returned.\nAs it was already very late\nand dark, we opted for the\nsame camping spot as the\nprevious night. Something\neasier tomorrow please.\nSunday 27 March \u2013\nFium Orbo (by Jim)\nAfter a couple of hours\u2019 driving whilst getting severely\ndripped on, we reached the\nFium Orbo, where the weather chose to brighten up con-siderably. After checking the\ngauge about 0.5km up and\ndeciding the level was decent,\nwe pulled up at the closed\ncaf\u00e9 halfway up the river to\nbe met by a minibus full of\nFrench paddlers in full face\nhelmets. Chad decided he\nwas having a rest and would\nmeet us at the bottom.\nWe got on to discover a lovely continuous pool-drop river\nand soon caught up with the\nFrench group. They seemed\nto want to inspect everything\nand after about a kilometre\nof using them as probes, we\ngot bored and overtook them.\nAbout halfway down we came\nacross a 2m drop that had\na dodgy looking siphon, so\nwent for the portage river\nleft. This required an excellent 3m seal-launch back into\nthe river.\nAnother interesting rapid\nfollowed, requiring a seal-launch past the start on river\nright. Patrick managed this\nfine, but upon landing I decided my helmet hadn\u2019t been sufficiently tested yet, so opted\nto do the rapid upside down,\nrolling up at the bottom \u2013 oh\nwell.\nWe carried on down to just\nbefore the gauge, where the\nleaky boat and nasty looking rapid made me decide\nit was time to exit. Patrick\nopted to run this one, which\nconsisted of a double drop\nthat flushed into a cliff-face.\nFor some reason he thought\nthat the second drop was best\nattempted upside-down, and\nliterally ended up climbing\nthe wall to get out of an awkward situation!\nChad had found us by this\ntime, and we hauled the\nboats back up to the road and\nthen went to recover the car.\nOnce we were back on the\nroad again, we headed south\ntowards the Travo. After getting the tents up with much\nbending of pegs, we cooked\ndinner, made a dent in the\nwhisky and attempted boat\nrepair \u2013 Blue Peter style!\nEventually we went to sleep\nknowing that the following\nday we would be paddling the\nmost famous (or infamous)\nriver in Corsica \u2013 the Travo.\nMonday 28 March \u2013\nTravo (by Patrick)\nI had seen this river from the\nroad the day before and got\nquite excited. We parked the\ncar at the get-in where a sign\ntold us that we could only be\non the river between 10am\nand 6pm. It\u2019s not going to take\nthat long, I told myself... how\nwrong I was.\nThe river was full of loads\nof amazing pool drops that\nwere either run or portaged\nfairly easily. This, however,\nwas the exception to the rule.\nA set of rapids were decided\nto be \u201cnot worth it\u201d, but I\nwished I had paddled them\nnow. The portage consisted\nof trying to drag the boats\nover 45 degree smooth rocks,\nwhich was a nightmare task.\nHowever, after much effort,\nwe got back in and carried on\ndown. We then came to the\ncrux of the river, the reason I\nwas so excited about Corsica\n\u2013 the amphitheatre falls.\nThe photographs were of\npicture perfect smooth falls\nover smooth bedrock in a\nbreathtaking rock amphithea-tre-like gorge. The inspection\nwas difficult and the water\nwas higher than I had seen\nin the photos. The first drop\nlooked easy enough, but the\nlarger second one could not\nbe seen easily. We all ran the\nfirst drop and managed to get\nout to look more carefully at\nthe second drop. At that point,\nanother group of paddlers\narrived. Their big creek boats\nand full-faced helmets meant\nthey had to be German. I was\nproved correct and the leader\nran the second drop without\neven getting out of his boat\nto have a look. This was all\nthe convincing I needed, and\nI quickly jumped in my boat\nand copied exactly what he\ndid. The others opted for the\nportage.\nAt this point we realised the\ntime and exactly how much\nriver we had left to do. After\ndiscussion, we decided to\nkeep on going. Another arduous portage around the killer\nrapid followed. We were all\nvery tired but no end was in\nsight and we had to keep on\ngoing. What happened next is\nprobably one of the most odd\nsituations I have had in my\nkayaking career\nAn easy boulder garden led\ninto a chunkier rapid around\na bend. I, for some reason,\ndecided to go upside down in\nthe easy bit and my paddles\nwere ripped from my hands.\nI hand-rolled up and managed to get myself into the\nsmallest of eddies which I\ncould only stay in by holding\nonto the rocks. My paddles\nfloated down the rapid but\nwere luckily caught by our\ngood friends the Germans.\nThere was, however, no possible way of getting them to\nme. In the end I had to try\nto cross the river with just\nmy hands as paddles. This\nproved unsuccessful and I\nwas washed quickly towards\nthe oncoming chunky rapid.\nDesperation led to Ralph\nthrowing my paddles, using\nthe best javelin technique I\nhave ever seen, straight into\nmy open hands.

And what an 80\nminutes it turned out to be.\nWye kicked off the match\nand immediately put pressure on LSE in the form of\nan aggressive wall of maroon\nand white shirts. The awesome attack from the Wye\ngirls prompted panic within\nthe attacking LSE line, forcing them to make mistakes\nand suffer many turnover\nballs.\nThe first try came from a\nblindside set piece move off\na scrum, which was run in\nby the scrum-half from the\nhalfway line, all the way\nbeing chased by LSE. The\ntry would not have been successful without the excellent\ncommunication between the\nhalf-backs and the amazing\nstrength of the pack.\nPossession was difficult for\nWye to come by. LSE were\nvery strong in attack and\nrecycled the ball extremely\nwell. Tackling was key to\nWye\u2019s performance. Annie\u2019s\ntackling was especiallystrik-ing, and overall she put in a\nfabulous display on the pitch.\nLSE came close to scor-ing, taking the ball across our\ntry line but being unable to\nground it with Liz and Andrea\nunder the ball. This outstanding defensive effort provoked\nincreased determination\nin the forwards. A massive\ntackle by Mary turned the\nball over. In a blink of an\neye, the ball was efficiently\npassed down our back line\nto the winger, Lucy, who ran\nin between the sticks for our\nsecond try of the game.\nTowards the end of the first\nhalf, Wye took charge and\ndominated the game within\nLSE\u2019s 22 yard line.

Jim and I did a\nscout up the hillside to find\nthe road. After much effort\nand scratched legs, we found\nit. We went back down for our\nkit and we all headed back up.\nEmerging onto the road, we\nheard dodgy electronic techno music coming from down\nthe road. A van with kayaks\ncame round the corner. It was\nthe Germans again! They\ngave Jim a lift to the top and\nthe sense of relief could be\nfelt by all. It was eight o\u2019clock.\nWe had taken eight and a half\nhours to do four and a half\nkilometres of water.\nThe evening consisted\nof eating pizza in a nearby\ntown and then a long drive to\nthe put-in for the Tavignano,\nwhere we were due to meet\nup with some guys from the\nGlaxo paddling club. We all\nfell asleep, absolutely knack-ered!\nTuesday 29 March \u2013\nTavignano and disaster!\n(by Jim)\nThe guys from Glaxo arrived\nin the morning and after a\nquick change we hopped into\nour respective cars and drove\ndown to the bottom of the\nriver. We arrived at the takeout and myself and a guy from\nGlaxo got into the third car to\nbe driven back up to the top.\nMy memory of the events\nthat followed is somewhat\nhazy. I can remember pulling\noff and talking to the guy in\nthe seat in front. I can also\nremember seeing a white van\nhurtling towards us and both\ncars skidding in the same\ndirection. The fraction of a\nsecond before impact will\nremain with me for the rest of\nmy life \u2013 knowing that you\u2019re\nabout to hit and there\u2019s sod\nall you can do isn\u2019t a particularly nice feeling!\nFortunately, all three of\nus got out of the wreckage\nwithout much damage. The\nFrench bloke we hit wasn\u2019t so\nfortunate. Whilst the Laguna\nhad excellent crumple zones,\nseat belt tensioners and\nfront airbags, his little van\nbenefited from none of these.\nEventually the emergency\nservices arrived. Their priority was obviously the French\nguy, but our driver was also\ntreated for a suspected broken foot and I had some seat-belt cuts treated by the para-medics. By this time there\nwere three police cars, three\ndifferent ambulances, a fire\ncrew and a helicopter.\nThe French bloke got air-evacuated after being cut out\nthrough the back of the van.\nOur driver was also taken to\nhospital. We were asked to\nfollow the gendarmes to their\nstation. We were interviewed\nseparately by a policewoman who spoke reasonable\nEnglish, and were also asked\nto sign statements.\nThe others had a more\nenjoyable day, according to\nChad:\n\u201cWe started sombrely at the\nTavignano, given that there\nhad just been a car crash\nthat had put all but two of the\nGlaxo group either in hospital\northepolicestationalongwith\nJim. We decided to set off, as\nwe would have to wait four\nto six hours anyway before\nthe police were finished. It\nstarted relatively easily with\na few kilometres of flat water\npaddling, the only feature of\nnote being a hydroelectric\ndam that required portaging.\nThe only exit was through the\ninlets, but presumably there\nmust be some kind of warning before they open them,\notherwise things could get\nquite interesting!\n\u201cThen came the bit we were\nall waiting for \u2013 the gorge sec-tion. This was fun, however\ndue to my over-optimistic\ninterpretation of the temperature I just wore a cag-deck\nand shorts and since little\nsunlight enters the gorge (at\none point it narrowed to less\nthan paddle width), it gets\ncold. However, this had an\nunusual benefit in that the\none time I did capsize, after\nthree roll attempts, it seemed\nabout time for my daily swim\nbut given the lack of insulation on my nether regions I\nremained in the boat and on\nthe sixth attempt I was in\ncalm enough water. However,\none of the Glaxo crew did\nhave a brief swim there after\nno roll attempts.\n\u201cAfter2kmofthiswereached\nthe get-out and awaited the\nreturn of a Laguna to transport us back to Jim at the\npolice station. Whilst waiting,\nwe had a look at the road\nmarkings at the accident site\nto keep warm.\u201d\nThe others turned up at the\nstation and got changed into\ntheir dry things. Eventually\nwe all headed back to the\nother guy\u2019s gite. Once there\nwe made use of the cooking facilities and hot show-ers. When I removed my boot,\nmy foot was pretty black and\nnicely swollen \u2013 a definite end\nto my paddling on this trip.\nFood was consumed in vast\nportions and beers, whisky\nand some strange local brew\nwere drunk. Eventually we\nall settled down for a good\nnight\u2019s kip, with me being\nvery glad to have survived\nrelatively unharmed.\nWednesday 30 March \u2013\nLower Asco (by Chad)\nAfter some tea and breakfast\nat the gite, we parted company with the Glaxo posse and\nheaded off to do a warm down\nriver. After a brief trip to find\na bakery, we found our way to\nthe Lower Asco. Jim followed\nthe progress from the road\nabove with the camera and\nwe set off in what must have\nbeen the clearest river I\u2019ve\never paddled in.\nIt proved a rather leisurely\nrun with no horizons for me\nto get out and inspect so, just\nto show willing, I got out to\n\u201cinspect\u201d the bottom of an\neddy. My initial fear was that\nJim had recorded this ultra-lame swim but to my relief\nhe was round the corner.\nUnfortunately Patrick did see\nit (how did he get the camera\nout so fast?)\nWe finished the river by\n2pm, and so had plenty of\ntime to drive to Bastia and\npolish out the scratches on\nthe car roof left by the rack.\nAfter four hours of searching,\nwe found what we were looking for and drove back toward\nBonifacio to await the ferry\nthe next day.\nAfter fixing the car roof we\nset up camp in a nice park\nand chilled out on the beach\nwatching the sun go down\nwhilst reflecting on a day that\nwas in stark (and welcome)\ncontrast to the previous day\u2019s\nvehicular carnage.\nThursday 31 March/\nFriday 1 April \u2013 the fools\nfly home (by Jim)\nWe spent Thursday leisurely\nwaiting for the ferry and then\ndriving back across Sardinia.\nThat night we set up camp\nright next to the airport, but\nthe sound of the planes didn\u2019t\ndisturb us too much \u2013 we\nwere far too tired!\nAn early start saw us\nreturning the abused hire\ncar and checking into the\nairport before flying back to\nStansted.\nSo that was the end of our\nCorsican adventure \u2013 an\nincredibly tiring, but very\nenjoyable 9 days!\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 12 May 2005 11\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk\nRalph on the lower Travo\nImperial canoeists relax in Corsica\nPatrick on the Rizzanese\nJim\n\n"

She\nnever sees them, but they spot her,\nyet she doesn\u2019t report the incident\nuntil the next day, after she learns\nthat Matobo\u2019s dictator, Zuwanie\n(who has been accused of ethnic\ncleansing and brought up on charges of genocide in the World Court),\nis coming to the UN to make a\nspeech.\nCoincidence? That\u2019s what Secret\nService agent Tobin Keller (Sean\nPenn), a professional cynic, wants\nto know. Silvia is uncommunicative\nabout her past and secretive about\nher present.\nThe Interpreter is touted as the\nfirst commercial movie to shoot\ninside the United Nations, which\nmeans that this thriller is blessed\nwith a truly incredible set-piece.\nThe movie also boasts two of the\nbest actors around \u2013 Kidman and\nPenn, along with director Pollack,\nare all Oscar winners. By all meas-ures, The Interpreter should be one\nof the sharpest movies around, but\nit is not. It is intelligent, intriguing\nand topical, but too often it gets\nbogged down in its own good inten-tions.\nThe United Nations serve as little\nmore than an inspired backdrop for\nwhat turns out to be political thriller\nthat, while often gripping, is neither\nas clever as it tries to be or as politically savvy as it pretends to be.\nThe writers take care to make misinterpretation itself a bit of a motif\nby playing with it in small ways, with\nsmaller discussions throughout the\nmovie \u2013 very clever. The dialogue\nbetween Penn and Kidman is sharp,\ninteresting and at times rich. Their\nacting is powerful and compelling.\nThe screenwriters enjoy painting\nher as the word-lover, the linguist;\nshe listens. And they paint Penn\nas the face man \u2013 he peers into the\neyes of his subjects and tosses them\nsome line to see if they choke them-selves. He doesn\u2019t seem to trust\ntheir words as much as his gut feeling regarding their sincerity.\nIf there was ever a romantic suggestion between the two damaged\nloners, removed from the social\nworld because of the pain of loss,\nKidman and Penn do away with\nit completely. The heat of danger\nmay break down the fence between\nthem momentarily, but back in the\ncalm they retreat into their shells.\nUnfortunately, the script gives them\nnothing beyond their dramatic tragic pasts and Pollack doesn\u2019t seem\ninterested in filling in the blanks.\nInstead it\u2019s another one of the film\u2019s\ncorny storylines \u2013 it just seems as\nthough they\u2019ve ripped off ideas from\nother films with the intention of\nmaking them look a bit tacky.\nIf you start to think, you might\nponder why an emotionally fractured agent would be in charge of\nsuch a powder-keg situation. Or why\nKidman\u2019s character isn\u2019t taken into\nprotective custody immediately. Or\nwhy the US intelligence agencies\nare so, well, damn stupid.\nThat\u2019s not to say the film doesn\u2019t\nhave any fascinating or surprisingly\nfunny scenes. At one point, with the\nSecret Service shadowing three different figures, the characters and\ntheir American shadows all converge on the same city bus. The\nediting (by William Steinkamp) is\nsomething to behold. He juggles\nmultiple stories, characters and\nperspectives, keeping the narrative\nline impossibly clean while building\nan old-fashioned sense of tension\nand suspense by slowly building the\ntempo, paced by Penn\u2019s performance as the Secret Service point\nman choreographing his agents\nwhile pondering the real meaning\nof the \u201ccoincidence\u201d.\nBut apart from the film\u2019s climactic\nbus sequence and another nicely\ncrafted sequence towards the movie\u2019s end, this thriller never visually\nbuilds much tension or suspense.\nCatherine Keener (Being John\nMalkovich) is sadly underused in\nthe role of Keller\u2019s wise-cracking\npartner. This is probably due to poor\nscript development. Had this been\nexpanded a bit more, the film could\nhave been more than just average.\nThe Interpreter is ultimately fluent in many things, but an out-and-out thriller it is not.

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nSo here comes summer, bringing\nwasps, bikinis and Hot Hot Heat,\none of the most criminally underachieving bands to have graced our\nshores (via Canada).\nWhilst everyone is desperately\nrunning around emulating bands\nlike Television or Right Said Fred\n(I\u2019m onto you, Kapranos), HHH have\nbeen sounding like XTC for ages\nalready. Their debut album, Make\nUp The Breakdown, faded away to\nnothing despite its brilliance. The\nindie dancefloor slaying Bandages,\nfrom that very album, should\nhave been number one for a gazillion weeks, but the \u2018Great\u2019 British\nGovernment decided that singing\nthe word \u2018bandages\u2019 during the Iraq\nWar was insensitive and took it off\nthe air, further adding to our war\ncrimes.\nBut look! It\u2019s now 2005 and you\u2019ve\ngot quirky indie popsters like Franz\nFerdinand and Kaiser Chiefs scaling\nthe charts: HHH are perfect for this\nmusical climate. Check out forth-comingsingleGoodnightGoodnight,\nall off-beat drums, bright guitar and\nbouncy Hammond organ, instantly\naccessible and just clever enough.\nIt\u2019s bound to sit comfortably on the\nplay lists of Radio1, XFM, local radio\nand, um, even IC Radio.\nLet\u2019s take a moment to observe\nfront man Steven Bays. Originally\nhe was only the keyboardist, but they\nbooted the singer and he took over.\nHe has an ace yelpy Canadian singing voice, melodic and effortlessly\nup-beat.Morenoticeablesomehowis\nhis incredible man-\u2018fro: it makes the\nhairy one out of Hundred Reasons\nlook like a billiard ball. Lyrically,\nHHH aren\u2019t going to win an Ivor\nNovello, relying more on bitchy one-liners or witty turns of phrase, my\npersonal favourite being: \u201cRunning\nwith scissors wasn\u2019t smart, I tripped\nand cut open your heart!\u201d\nBays\u2019 delivery is the important\nthing. I challenge you not to smile\nwhen he starts and ends Island Of\nThe Honest Man with a frantic a\ncapella: \u201cI was picked up and then\ndropped off in a culture counterclockwise turned around.\u201d\nThere are so many gems here that\nit\u2019s hard to pick any out specifically.\nShame On You has a nice latino beat,\nand piano-led album track Elevator\nis reminiscent of wonderful album\ncloser In Cairo from their previous\nalbum.\nBarring another war, HHH should\nbe assaulting your eyes and ears for\nthe foreseeable future. So there you\ngo, better than wasps and at least as\ngood as bikinis. James Millen\nThe name that he records under\nmay sound awful, but it is honestly\nhis name. According to his website,\nMr Lindy Vopnfjord (something I\ncan\u2019t personally pronounce), hails\nfrom Icelandic shores, where he\nbegan to play guitar from the age of\ntwo and toured with his folk-singing\nfamily. His online home also hints\nthis may all be a lie, so I choose to\nbelieve he was raised by a polar\nbear or something. But some people\nwill say anything. It\u2019s what he sings\nthat counts.\nLindy certainly has a beautiful\nvoice. In places it has a raw, gruff,\nScandinavian edge, a bit like a Kelly\nJones you don\u2019t want to kick. In\nothers it effortlessly soars into the\nhigher octaves, with a satisfying\nvibrato, more like a Matt Bellamy\nwith the volume turned down. His\nfolk roots are evident in his songs,\nhis style of finger picking punctuated by heavy strumming is common throughout. The ace in Lindy\u2019s\npack is that, unlike his folk con-temporaries, he hasn\u2019t descended\ninto beard-stroking quirkiness (\u00e0\nla Devendra Banhart), but instead\nmanages a more northern English\nindie sound. Rather fittingly, he has\nrecently signed to new Mancunian\nrecord label My Dad Recordings,\nand labelmates such as Jack Cooper\nprovide a good reference point.\nLead track Beautifully Undone\nconsists of a delicately plucked\nmelody with light strings, clearly\nhighlighting his voice. In The Air\nenlists a full band to produce a fuller,\nmore upbeat sound. It reminds me\nof Oxford boys Goldrush at their\nmost pop, with a jangling backing\noverlaid with slide guitar. After All\nThe Rain Falls is in a similar vein\nto the title track. It is more ethereal,\nwith extremely light synth and piano\nunderneathgentleguitar.Towardsits\nclose, strings and drums are brought\nin as the song builds, culminating in\ncymbal crashes aplenty before dying\nback down again. Most interesting is\nLook At The Way. Though from the\nsurface it appears to be a standard\nguitar/bass/drums-type track, Lindy\nexecutes some tricky counter melodies to the instrument line. At times\nhe cautiously borders on being out of\ntune, but the closeness of dischord is\nskilfully mastered.\nWhile I don\u2019t see him crashing the\ncharts any time soon, Lindy is the\nkind of artist who will build a solid\nfan base. And who knows where\nthat kind of momentum can lead? I\nmean, who saw Damien Rice com-ing? This four track single is worth\neighteen minutes of anyone\u2019s time.\nJames Millen\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 12 May 2005\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nSummer is here\nWhile the weather may be utterly crap, Hot Hot Heat\u2019s quirky, danceable indie will bring a\nsmile to your face, as will Brendan Benson\u2019s live show\n15\nHot Hot Heat\nElevator\n(SIRE)\nHHHHI\nLIVE REVIEWS\nSupport slots can be tricky things.\nOn the one hand, you get to play to\naudiences larger than you would\nprobably get if you were headlin-ing, but on the other hand you have\nto win over people who have paid\nto see someone else and are probably getting impatient for the main\nevent.\nFortunately for Hal, their particular brand of sunny west coast pop\nis very difficult to dislike. Taking to\nthe Electric Ballroom\u2019s rather small\nstage, front man Dave Allen introduces the band in an interminable\nIrish drawl, a stark contrast to his\nclear and well pitched singing voice.\nThere\u2019s quite a loud hum of conversation from the disinterested audience as the band begin their set, but\nby the time they\u2019ve played first single\nWhat A Lovely Dance a few songs\nin, the crowd are suitably impressed.\nHal may be playing a dingy club\nsomewhere in north London, but\nthroughout the half hour-long set\nyou could swear you were enjoying a\nCalifornian summer.\nBy the time headline act and\nDetroit native Brendan Benson\nstepped onto the stage, the Electric\nBallroom was living up to its name\nin terms of the atmosphere. The set\nstarted off with the pop tunes that\nhave earned him his following, lifted\nmainly from his two earlier albums.\nMidway through, he declared it time\nfor the \u201csinger-songwriter part of\nthe show,\u201d so with acoustic guitar\nin tow he strummed out the songs\nand the crowd sang along with every\nheartfelt word. It is a truly amazing\nexperience when such a large group\nof people all connect with the music;\nyou can only imagine what Benson\nwas feeling as the crowd became\none big backing vocal. The rest of\nthe set mainly comprised of songs\nfrom his latest album, Alternative\nTo Love, which were performed bril-liantly, sung with a verve and energy\nthat is so often missing from solo\nsinger-songwriters.\nAn alternative to love? I\u2019m not\ntoo sure about that, but listening to\nBrendan Benson is a good place to\nstart.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 12 May 2005 9\nColumns felix@ic.ac.uk\nUniversities in this country love\nto give their students the opportunity to divert their attention from their\nwork (in your case) or from clubbing and girls (in mine). In order to\nprevent students from passing the\nyear, students\u2019 unions create sports\nteams.\nPeople join a sports team because:\na) they like playing sports; b) it\u2019s\ncool and they think they\u2019re going\nto pull more chicks (instead of the\nusual 0 girls per year, their average raises to an astonishing 0.43);\nc) they provide the opportunity to\nget drunk every Wednesday at the\nUnion (unless you join the Keraaazy\nArchery Club or the Table Tennis\nGangstas).\nSports clubs provide a great environment in which to analyse the different personalities within Imperial\nCollege, of which I highlight the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 The arseholes \u2013 they were born\nfor sports. Football flows in their\nveins (unfortunately, I can\u2019t say the\nsame about intelligence), rugby all\nover their skin and hockey on their\nwrists. They are professional scor-ing/tackling/dribbling machines, but\nit\u2019s a shame that they can\u2019t tie their\nown shoe laces or go shopping to\nSainsbury\u2019s without confusing \u00a313.50\nwith \u00a313,500.\n\u2022 The geeks \u2013 they are nerds and\nthey know it, but they try to disguise it by joining a cool sports\nteam, crowded with hardcore party\nanimals. They love to spend their\npocket money on cranberry juice\nto do sick mixes like \u2018stroking the\nsalami on the beach\u2019 (cranberry and\norange juice) or \u2018bubbly fizzle\u2019 (coke\nand fanta) and down them with\ntheir badminton, ultimate frisbee or\nsquash mates.\n\u2022 The losers \u2013 they love their sport,\neven though they suck and their\nteam languishes at the bottom of\nthe league.\n\u2022 The drunks \u2013 members of all\nclubs (except table tennis, archery\nand badminton), their main objective is to destroy their livers before\nthey graduate, so that they won\u2019t\nhave to worry about finding a job.\nThey usually spend their after-noons/evenings/mornings drinking\npitchers and playing drinking games\n(such as the famous \u2018drinking a shot\nevery time someone in the room\nbreathes\u2019).\n\u2022 The stoners \u2013 they love nature\nand feeling all the sensations\nof the world (and spending their\nfood budget on drugs). So they join\nclubs where they can either be in\naltered states of mind (kendo, tai-chi, karate, yoga or origami) or in\ndirect contact with God\u2019s touch and\nwrite poetry about what they see\nwhile rock climbing, canoeing or\nsurfing.\n\u2022 The teen movie girls \u2013 I can\u2019t\nimagine a changing room crowded\nwith naked women without at least\none lesbian fantasy coming to mind.\nCome on! If I were female and next\nto all these fit and athletic ladies,\nI wouldn\u2019t even think twice! I don\u2019t\nknow if that\u2019s the result of all the\nporn I\u2019ve seen since the age of 12\nbut, please don\u2019t take this dream\naway from me!\n\u2022 The fat smoking bastards \u2013 they\nknow they are fat and lazy, but in\norder to feel less guilty, they play\none of those not-having-to-move-their-arse \u2018sports\u2019, such as darts,\nsnooker or table football.\n\u2022 The useless wannabes \u2013 like\nfungi, they are everywhere and you\ncan\u2019t get rid of them! Usually they\nend up in the fifth team licking the\ncoach\u2019s arse.\n\u2022 The rich boys \u2013 they are crap\nat everything they do, but as they\nwere born with a golden spoon in\ntheir mouth they can afford the best\nkit. They usually play really exclusive and expensive sports that noone knows how to play or that they\neven exist, such as golf, fencing or\ncricket.\nPersonalities apart, there is another parallel universe in sports teams\nat Imperial: the medics.\nI could write a whole column\nbitching about them! They think they\nare so much better than the mere\nmortals like engineers or scientists\nthat they have to have their own\nteams: no mixing allowed! Maybe\nit\u2019s the fact that they can\u2019t stand the\nidea of getting the shit kicked out\nof them (like I will, after the sports\nteams read this article) by lousy\nnon-divine people. Whatever floats\ntheir boat...\nMy point this week: joining a sports\nteam is always good because, even if\nyou suck, it improves your social\nskills and maybe your biceps and\nabs too. It\u2019s always better spending a Wednesday afternoon rubbing\nyour face in a puddle of mud or\nsomeone\u2019s sweaty, smelly or sexy\narmpit, than laying in front of the TV\nand bloating your belly.\nLet\u2019s get physical.\nAnalyse them\nSo Channel 4 has finally given up\nthe fight. They know they\u2019ll never\nbeat Five for sheer cultural value\nany more, and so have swapped\nplace with them. Now Channel 4 is\nthe place to scour for poor quality\nporn, and Five is the place to go for\ninteresting documentaries on things\nlike the \u2018the boy whose skin fell off\nand was eaten by naughty teenagers\u2019. Which is always a draw. And\nbloody FilmFour nicked all the good\nmovies whilst no-one was watching.\nBastards.\nWhat have Channel 4 replaced the\nhard-hittingdramasanddocumenta-ries with? Will & Grace, Everybody\nLoves Raymond and The Top 100\nBest Shows That Cause Internal\nHaemorrhage. All of these are crap,\nespecially Raymond, as no-one\nloves Raymond. At least no-one with\na modicum of self-respect.\nThe only good Top 100... show was\nin fact the last one, which was all\nabout cartoons. This is because you\ndon\u2019t get to watch your favourite\ncartoons all that often \u2013 when was\nthe last time you watched Dungeons\nand Dragons? All 100 were much-loved classics, and it was nice to see\nthem again. The rubbish \u2018celebrities\u2019 that intone on them could have\nbeen lost, or preferably shot. But\nother than this one \u2018gem\u2019, the rest\nare bollocks. Why do I care whether\nor not Jimmy Carr is the number\none most hated comedian in the\nsouth of Wales? Does it matter?\nObviously the national hatred of a\nsmug bastard is always good, but\nwe\u2019ve got Damien Rice for that.\nAnd who votes for these things\nanyway? I bet it\u2019s the same bored\nhousewives that appear on Trisha\nfor guidance from the Morality\nQueen, and therefore these polls\nare truly representative. Is this lack\nof good TV just because the producers have become so damn lazy that\nrepeating the same four-hour show\nevery week for eternity seems a\ngood idea? Or is it an edgy social\nexperiment? Maybe they\u2019re trying\nto up the national birth rate \u2013 nothing good on TV leads to more sex\nthrough sheer boredom.\nHang on... that\u2019s a bloody good\nreason to watch Channel 4... I\u2019ll get\nso bored that even I will have sex.\nThe plan can\u2019t fail. And you say they\njust have loads of random porn on it?\nWhy haven\u2019t I seen this before? Real\nboobs, you say? Be right back...\nBloody hell. That was pretty good,\nuntil I had to vote for my favourite\nbreast moment. \u00a31 for a one second\nclip of Jodie Marsh doesn\u2019t make\nmy bank manager happy. Besides,\nI voted for Britney \u2013 how was I to\nknow she wasn\u2019t on the poll?\nOne hundred reasons\nby TRISTAN LANE\nby DIOGO GERALDES\nWhy is the government so\nkeen on the arbitrary target\nof getting 50% of school leav-ers to attend University?\nBlair et al state that more people\nneed to be educated to university\nlevel so that the UK can maintain\nits position as the world\u2019s fourth biggest economy. Obviously, it is important to maintain our economy in its\npresent happy state and university\neducated people generally contribute more to it. But how many highly\neducated people does the country\nactually need?\nThe arbitrary target is just that\n\u2013 arbitrary. There are no targets for\nindividual subjects. There is a difference between chemical engineering or economics and surf science\nor tennis. How do these so-called\n\u2018Mickey Mouse\u2019 courses contribute\nto the economy? Also, I know the\nmedia is playing an ever-increasing\nrole in our society, but how many\nmedia studies graduates does the\ncountry really need?\nCurrently over 40% of people go to\nuniversity, many of whom can\u2019t find\na graduate level job. So after years\nof toil, they are in the same position\nthey were in before they went to\nuniversity, the only difference being\nthat they are also saddled with a\nmassive debts. I wonder how many\nof these people agree with the 50%\ntarget.\nIf a university education were\nrestricted to those undertaking relevant and useful degrees, there would\nnot be the need for the introduction\nof top-up fees.\nIt is my opinion that the government is only keen on increasing university intakes because it reduces\nunemployment figures.\nI am not arguing that people\nshould be prevented from going to\nuniversity \u2013 it is a fantastic opportunity and we are privileged to be here.\nIt is marvellous that more people\nhave the chance to go to university,\nand the door should remain open to\neveryone.\nBut university is not the only\noption. If you have ever had to call\nout a plumber, carpenter or electri-cian, you\u2019ll know that these guys\n(there are virtually no women) are\nin intense demand. There is a great\nshortage of key skilled workers in\nthe UK, but in schools pupils are\ngenerally not informed of the other\noptions, such as apprenticeships.\nThe shortage of tradesmen has\nlead to an influx of highly skilled\nEastern European labourers. In line\nwith the rules of supply and demand,\ngetting a leaky boiler fixed is now a\nserious financial outlay. The earning\npotential of the trades has led numerous professionally trained people to\nmake the switch, notably the doctor\nwho retrained as a plumber.\nIf it is common knowledge that\nthere is money to made being a\ntradesman, and the job prospects of\nuniversity graduates are continuing\nto decline, why aren\u2019t more school-leavers starting apprenticeships?\nThe main attractions of university\nare the opportunity to move out of\nhome and live with your friends,\nand the \u2018debaucherous lifestyle\u2019 it\nbrings. Conversely, apprentices generally stay at home, splitting their\ntime between formal learning and\non-the-job training with people many\nyears their senior.\nThis may lead to apprentices\nbelieving they are missing out on the\nsocial benefits provided by univer-sity. To solve this problem, I propose\nresidential trade-skill \u2018universities\u2019,\nwhere students can learn useful\nprofitable skills and enjoy the benefits of living away from home.\nDr Karl\nThe President has not responded\nwith regard to why Dr Karl Kennedy\n(Alan Fletcher) is appearing at Royal\nHolloway Union and not Imperial\nCollege Union.\nThe Neighbours generation\nby RUPERT NEATE\n\n"

This is\noften an issue upon which students\u2019\nunions campaign.\nAt Imperial, a childcare facility is\nprovided at Princes Gardens for the\nchildren of both staff and students.\nIt caters for babies and children\naged from six months to five years,\nand can accommodate around 54\nchildren. However, there is a long\nwaiting list.\nStudents with children may be eligible for some benefits. If you meet\nthe criteria, you may well be eligible\nfor the following:\n\u2022 Parents Learning Allowance\n\u2013 This is intended to help cover your\ncourse related costs. How much you\nget depends on your income and\nthat of your partner or spouse if you\nhave one. The maximum entitlement is \u00a31,300.\n\u2022 Childcare Grant \u2013 If you have\nresponsibility for a child under the\nage of 15 (or 17 if (s)he has special\neducational needs) and you use registered or approved childcare, you\nmay be able to apply for the childcare grant.\n\u2022 Lone Parents Grant \u2013 This is\nonly available to students who\nstarted their course before\nSeptember 2001. It is not income\nassessed but if you are eligible for\nthis grant then you cannot claim the\nchildcare grant.\nThis is just a snapshot of the support that is available and, as mentioned before, not everyone will eligible for this help.\nIf you are a student parent and\nwould like more information on both\nthe Early Years Education Centre\nand student parent benefits, please\ndo not hesitate to contact The\nInformation And Advice Centre on\n020 7594 8067 or advice@ic.ac.uk.\nPop in and see us in the east wing\nbasement of Beit Quad, and you may\neven get a cup of tea!\nDon\u2019t let your concern turn into\na crisis. Make the Information and\nAdvice Centre your first choice for\nall your welfare needs.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nEditorial comment and the Felix interview will return next week\nRewards, regulations and redevelopment\nUnion Colours 2005\nIs there someone you want to recognise for their contribution to student\nlife at Imperial? Perhaps someone\nwho has been a powerful advocate\nfor representing student views in\nyour department? Or perhaps someone who has played an outstanding\nrole in helping to run your club or\nsociety?\nThe Union\u2019s Colours and other\nawards are made annually to individuals who have supported the\naims and objectives of the Union:\nrepresentation, student welfare,\nclubs and societies and provision of\nservices. Any person (including staff\nor someone from outside College)\nmay be nominated. Any full member\nof the Union (ie any student) may\nsend in a nomination. Nominations\nopen today and close on 25 May.\nDetails are available on the web at\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/colours.\nGovernance changes\u2026 and\nmore elections!\nThere has been consensus this\nyear in the Union Executive that we\nneed to elect the bulk of our offic-ers, Council and Executive, before\nthe summer holiday, so that they\nmay be trained and in post for the\nstart of the new academic year.\n(Historically, we have elected many\npositions at the start of the year.)\nTogether with the creation of the\npost of Deputy President (Graduate\nStudents), this has necessitated a look at our Constitution and\nRegulations.\nIn line with the Union Strategy\nagreed by Council, the Executive\nhave been developing proposals\nthat should make the Union more\naccountable. At the heart of this\nare two symbiotic proposals. The\nfirst is to make the Union\u2019s management committees (especially the\nExecutive and the Student Activities\nCommittee) more effective by giving\nthem appropriate responsibilities\nand reforming their memberships.\nThe second is to remove all Officers,\nexcept the Executive, from Council.\nThe remaining places on Council\nwould be filled by elected representatives from each faculty or department \u2013 so that there is a majority\nof non-Officers who are able to hold\nthe Officers to account.\nThe proposals should be discussed\nat Union Council tonight and then\nhopefully passed at an \u2018adjournment\nmeeting\u2019 on Monday. Assuming all\nis agreed, elections for a plethora\nof positions will start taking place\nshortly.\nLinstead Hall and Southside\nclosure\nMuch of my time has been occupied\nwith the future of Linstead Hall.\nThe position agreed by the Union\nExecutive has been that we should\naim to retain a catered hall on cam-pus. We are now negotiating with\nCollege over the position of evening\nmeals in Sherfield, which is looking\npositive. The College is determined\nto open the caf\u00e9/shop on the ground\nfloor of Linstead, which will now\nserve breakfast and weekend meals\n(currently unavailable in Princes\nGardens).\nAs previously reported in Felix,\nthe Linstead first floor area will\nremain the private communal area\nof the hall \u2013 consistent with all other\nImperial College halls. I have been\nsomewhat surprised to receive representations from Southside aficionados that a new bar could equally\nhave provided a social space for\nthe residents. This is simply not\ntrue. Look around you. How many\nstudents are there on the South\nKensington campus? Do they all\nuse the bars? Of course not \u2013 we\nonly have capacity for about 10% of\nstudents.\nThere is a proportion of our student population who do not like or\nfeel comfortable socialising in bars.\nMoreover, most people don\u2019t want to\nspend every night in a bar for lack\nof any other communal space. The\nCollege needs to provide alternative\nsocial provision, of which we currently have none in the evenings.\nIt also needs to be sensitive to the\nneeds of an increasingly cosmopolitan student body, and telling students in a hall of residence that\ntheir only social space is a general\nCollege bar just won\u2019t cut it.\nWhen friends from other universities visit, they often make the observation that Southside is more of a\n\u2018traditional university bar\u2019 than the\nUnion\u2019s. When I ask them what they\nmean, they talk of white, middle\nclass students, many of whom are\nwinter team sports players. The fact\nis that in an ever-changing student\ndemographic it becomes increasingly difficult to provide social space\nthat appeals to everyone.\nThat\u2019s not to say that the Union\nsocial facilities do much better \u2013\nhence the motivation behind creating a redevelopment masterplan for\nBeit.\nThe Southside bar has a long and\ncherished history and will be sorely\nmissed. The College does needs to\nprovide alternative social space,\nas well as improve what is left.\nHowever, it must be for the benefit\nof today\u2019s student body as a whole,\nnot yesterday\u2019s.\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\n\n"

Karthik complimented Vaibhav\u2019s attacking\nstroke play with a mixture of\ntight defence and some wristy\nshots square of the wicket.\nThe 50 partnership came\nup in the tenth over but just\nwhen the batsmen looked set\nfor more, they were dismissed\nagainst the run of play.\n54 for no wicket soon\nbecame 56 for 4 as Imperial\nsuffered a mini-collapse with\nKarthik, Vaibhav, Al and Peter\nsuccumbing to a mixture of\npoor judgement and careless\nstroke play. UCL had fought\nback strongly but Imperial\nhad enough batting depth to\nweather the storm. Jacob set\nabout rebuilding the innings\nwith some good sensible\nbatting and built partnerships with Avi, Khurram and\nDevesh.\nSoon defence turned into\nsingle-hunting, gliding and\nefficiently flicking in the gaps,\nand gradually Imperial accel-erated, with ones turning\ninto twos and the odd boundary being poached. When he\nfinally fell in the 36th over,\nJacob\u2019s fantastic knock of 60\nhad taken Imperial from a\nperilous position to a very\ncompetitive total. Jibran then\nused the long handle to good\neffect and Imperial finished\non 193-9 after 40 overs.\nImperial\u2019s fast bowlers,\nled by Jibran, then produced inspired spells in the\nafternoon as UCL found\nthemselves in deep trouble.\nJibran\u2019s terrific spell of fast\nbowling with his late swinging deliveries left the UCL\nbatsmen looking as confused\nas a child in a topless bar. A\ngood piece of fielding resulted\nin the first wicket when Asif\nfound himself inches short of\nthe batting crease.\nSubby then picked up a\ncouple of wickets, with Jacob\npulling off a tremendous\ncatch at backward point. Avi\nand Pete continued the good\nwork with some accurate and\ndisciplined bowling as the\nUCL batsmen crumbled, unable to handle the pressure.\nAlthough Imperial\u2019s fielding\nwas quite good overall, Jibran\nwas unlucky to have a couple of catches dropped off his\nbowling. Pete Munro then put\nan end to UCL\n\u2019s misery with\na perfect yorker to bowl them\nout for a mere 51.\nOn the whole it was a clinical and proficient team performance from the Imperial\nsecond XI, which has almost\nsecured its place in the semi-finals. The exceptional talent,\ncommitment, dedication and\nspirit should ensure that the\nteam goes the entire distance\nin this tournament.\nCRICKET\nIs your sports team active in the summer term?

The pack were brilliant\nto watch in the scrum, and if\nLSE did manage to win the\nball, Liz\u2019s quick breaking off\nmade sure that their number\n8 didn\u2019t get very far.\nEarly in the second half\nSuzie, after moaning in the\nminibus about how she knew\nshe was going to get hurt, dislocated her knee after a heavy\ntackle and had to be whisked\nto hospital. As a result, Jess\nwas drafted in to replace the\ninjured flanker. New to this\nposition, Jess played with\nstrength and determination\nadding to Wye\u2019s tackling abil-ity.\nSuzie\u2019s injury provoked a\nmajor attack. It was payback:\nno-one injures a Wye player\nand gets away with it. The\ntackles consequently got\nharder and more aggressive.\nFor most of the half there\nwere bodies from both teams\nall over the pitch, indicating the high intensity of the\ngame. Emily scored Wye\u2019s\nthird try 20 minutes before\nthe end with an inventive run\nwhich ultimately, along with\nher tackles, earnt her the\nmost valuable player award.\nAndrea kicked the conversion\nto put Wye 17-0 infront.\nAndrea\u2019s performance\nthroughout the game was\nexcellent, all the time making crucial tackles and kicking down field as much as\npossible.\nLil made some terrific\nbreaks on the left wing and\nwas very unlucky to score a\ntry, as she certainly deserved\none. Towards the end of the\ngame, Wye\u2019s determination\nnot to concede was immense.\nGemma battled to the end\nwith an ongoing injury displaying awesome courage,\nwhile Lou was propelled into\nthe air at every lineout, stealing many LSE throw-ins. Kate\nhad a great game as full-back,\nadding a sense of calm to the\nteam.\nOverall, it was a truly inspirational performance by the\nwhole team. It was great to\nsee the utter determination\nand superb teamwork displayed by everyone on the\npitch. The match was a once\nin a lifetime opportunity to\nachieve something for Wye\nladies\u2019 rugby and for Wye\nCollege and I\u2019m delighted\nthat the team\u2019s hard work\nthroughout the life of the club\nwas finally fulfilled.\nThe cup final marked the\nend of the Wye rugby season and was the last game\nfor many of the older play-ers. This win was a perfect\nway to end the year and left\nthe team on an eight match\nwinning streak. No-one ever\nthought with the founding of\nthe team, three years ago,\nthat we would ever achieve\nthe success that we have this\nseason.\nSpecial thanks must go to\nAndrea for founding the Wye\nladies\u2019 rugby team, to all our\nsupporters over the season,\nand of course to our amazing\ncoach, Hugh, who has shared\nhis knowledge, time and\nexperience of the game with\nus. Personally, I would also\nlike to congratulate the team\nand thank them for their com-mitment, support and enthusiasm throughtout the entire\nseason.\nThe year\u2019s success will\nnever be forgotton, especially by those leaving this\nyear. Wye will not be the\nsame without them and I\nhope they\u2019ll always remember the overwhelming feeling\nwhen the final whistle blew\nat the end of the cup final.\nI wish all the leaving players \u2013 Andrea, Annie, Hetty,\nEmily, Lou, Suzy, Liz, Lynette\nand Gemma \u2013 all the best\nin the future, in particular\nwith their rugby. You will be\nmissed.\nThe team will carry on and\nplay next season, with this\nyear\u2019s freshers hopefully\ncontinuing to play rugby. Our\nsuccess will be hard to beat,\nbut in true Wye spirit we\u2019ll\nalways battle on and tackle\nanything, any shape or size,\non the pitch.\nEven though Wye College\nis sadly losing its agricultural\nand science students, ladies\u2019\nrugby will still continue at the\nforefront of sport at Wye for\nas long as possible.\nWye has a crown, now the\nladies\u2019 rugby team have a\ncup.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 12 May 2005 5\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nDetectives were alerted to\nAlan Turing\u2019s \u2018crime\u2019 when he\nand his gay lover reported a\nburglary in 1952. The father\nof the modern computer and\nEnigma code breaker was\nlater charged with \u2018gross indecency\u2019 and given the choice of\nprison or a year of oestrogen\ninjections to neutralise his\nlibido. He chose the therapy,\nand committed suicide a year\nlater.\nYet although homosexuality is no longer considered\na crime or mental illness,\nbullying and harassment of\nlesbians, gay men and bisexual (LGB) men and women\ncontinues, and we have little\nunderstanding of its effect on\nmental health. Now scientists\nhave discovered that physical\nand verbal abuse may be driving some gays and lesbians to\nsuicide.\nA recent survey published\nby Imperial researchers into\nthe mental health of LGB people found that gay men and\nlesbians in the UK were 10%\nmore likely to have mental\nhealth problems than het-erosexuals. Most crucially,\nthe link between abuse and\nattempted suicide shows that\nhomophobic attacks really\ncan damage people.\nImperial psychiatrist Dr\nJames Warner discussed his\nfindings in his office at St\nMary\u2019s Hospital. He told Felix:\n\u201cGays, lesbians and bisexuals\nare at a greater risk of mental\ndisorder and deliberate self-harm than heterosexuals. We\nthink this may be caused by\ndiscrimination and having\nbeen bullied at school.\u201d\nThis is the first study to\nshow the potential effect of\ndiscrimination on mental\nhealth and the biggest clinical\nsurvey of its kind in the UK.\nIt involved over 2000 people,\njust over half of whom were\nlesbian, gay or bisexual.\nWarner and his colleagues\nneeded to find a sampling\ntechnique that would avoid\nbiasing the study, a particularly difficult issue when you are\nsurveying a dispersed population group. He explained the\nrecruitment techniques they\nused: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to recruit\nLGB men and women in gay\nvenues, but these people are\nmore comfortable with their\nsexuality than those who\ndon\u2019t go out. So to avoid bias\nwe used a snowball sampling\nmethod that works friendship\nnetworks.\u201d\nIt works like this. The first\nwave of people (group A) is\nrecruited via posters in health\nclubs and public libraries,\nadverts in the national, local\nand gay press, etc. Group A\ndo the questionnaire and are\ngiven five postcards to pass\non to friends who would be\nprepared to take part: group\nB. No sexuality requirement\nis made. Group B then nominates group C, and so on up\nto group G.\nParticipants completed a\ncomputer questionnaire with\nquestions about the mental\nhealth symptoms they had\nexperienced in the previous week, such as fatigue,\nmemory problems, sleep dis-turbance, irritability, worry\nabout physical health, depressive thoughts, general anxie-ty, compulsive behaviour and\nobsessive thoughts. This is a\nstandard procedure to assess\nmental health, termed the\nClinical Interview Schedule\n(CIS). They were also asked\nto describe their sexual ori-entation, indicating sexual\nattraction on a scale of 1 to\n5, with 1 indicating attraction\nonly to the opposite sex; 2,\nmostly to the opposite sex; 3,\nboth sexes equally, etc.\nThe survey found that 42%\nof the gay men, 43% of lesbians and 49% of bisexual men\nand women had a clinically\nrecognised mental health\nproblem, and nearly one third\nhad attempted suicide.\nDamage to property, personal attacks or verbal insults\nin the last five years or insults\nand bullying at school were\nreported by 83%, two thirds\nof whom attributed this discrimination to their sexual-ity. Mental health problems\n(high CIS scores) were linked\nto unemployment, conflict\nbetween religious belief and\nsexuality, being under 40,\nbeing attacked in the last five\nyears, being verbally assaulted in the last five years and\nhaving been bullied at school.\nOut of the whole sample, 31%\nhad attempted suicide. This\nwas linked to discrimination\nand school bullying, but not\nhigher CIS scores.\nWarner said: \u201cThe results\nof this research show that\nthere is a likely link between\nlevels of discrimination and\nan increased risk of mental\nhealth problems. Of course\nit cannot be proven to be a\ncausality, but many respondents linked attacks with their\nsexuality.\u201d\nNoneoftheLGBcounselling\ngroups that I contacted found\nthe link between discrimination and mental illness sur-prising. Allan Wardell, press\nofficerforStonewall,toldFelix:\n\u201cPhysical attacks on LGB\npeople and damage to property have severe implications\nfor mental health. The study\nhighlights the need for the\npolice and Crown Prosecution\nService to be aware of these\nissues and to take them seri-ously. Lesbians, gay men and\nbisexual men and women\nneed to be assured that the\npolice can be trusted to treat\nthem fairly.\u201d\nHe also spoke of the importance that health professionals be fully aware of the specific needs of LGB people.\nHe says: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a high\nincidence of mental health\nproblems in LGB people for\nmany years. The fact that\nonly half of gay men are not\nout to their GPs has implications on the health treatment\nthat they are given.\u201d Training\nfor mental health professionals should include increased\nawareness of the potential for\nsubstance misuse and self-harm in this group, he says.\nThe Imperial study finds relevance beyond the police and\nNHS: it has implications for\nhow all of society deals with\ngay people. This is a group\nof people, one in 20 Brits,\nwho have been oppressed for\nmany years.\nThe Right Rev Richard\nHarries, Bishop of Oxford,\ncommented on the study\u2019s\nfindings, saying that the\nhigh levels of discrimination\nreported are \u201cdisgraceful\u201d.\nHe says the study \u201creveals\nthat there is a residue of\nextremely unpleasant homophobia around. We are, unfor-tunately, still a long way from\nbeing a society that is truly\ninclusive and is sensitive and\nrespectful to those who are\ndifferent from the majority.\u2019\nSo can we accept people\nfor who they are or not? Alan\nTuring was very open about\nhis sexuality, and was persecuted for it. As young gays are\nincreasingly open about their\nsexuality, we need a society\nthat can respect and accept\nthem. This study is a stark\nreminder of what can happen\nif we do not.\n\u25cf For confidential\nstudent support\nand advice:\nwww.nightline.org.uk\nDiscrimination can lead to suicide\nA study at Imperial has suggested gays and lesbians suffer a higher risk of mental disorder due to\ndiscrimination. Sophie Hebden talked to the lead researcher and reports on the findings\nNew research at Imperial College reveals the damaging effects of discrimination against\nhomosexuals\nBy Sarah Hogan\nBiological sciences\nIt takes an average of 20 minutes of concentrated effort\nto attain, but normally only\nlasts 30 seconds. It has been\nbaffling inexperienced teenage boys since the dawn of\ntime, but the female orgasm\nhas also puzzled evolutionary\nbiologists.\nThe male orgasm is a brief\nfeeling of intense pleasure,\ncoupled with ejaculation of\nsemen containing sperm with\nthe male\u2019s DNA. It\u2019s essential\nwhen it comes to passing on\nthose highly desirable genes.\nThe female orgasm, however,\nseems unnecessary for making babies, but according to\nsome new theories it may be\na clever way of ensuring a girl\ngets what she wants out of\nher man.\nIf the male partner is capable of making her reach a cli-max, he must be physically fit,\nso the female can be assured\nthat any offspring will be\nhealthy. However, there are\nno guarantees of healthy off-spring, since we can all pass\non faulty genes we\u2019re not\naware we have.\nA more likely reason for\nfemale orgasms is incentive:\nshe will be more likely to have\nsex with her man again if she\nenjoys the experience, and so\nthe chances of conception are\nincreased.\nThere are also more practical explanations for this energetically costly experience.\nDuring orgasm, a woman\u2019s\npelvic muscles, vaginal walls\nand uterus contract, and the\nposition of the uterus tilts\nslightly.Thesemovementsare\nthought to direct the semen\ntowards the uterus. This may\nbe the reason why women can\nexperience multiple orgasms.\nInterestingly, the aftereffects of an orgasm may\nbe just as important as the\nclimax itself. The feeling of\nexhaustion that follows such a\npeak of pleasure encourages\nthe female to stay lying still\nafter sex, helping to retain the\nsperm inside her.\nThese reasons all refer back\nto when we had caves, not\nbeds, and making babies was\nour top priority. Now, how-ever, it is not necessarily so.\nThere is another theory more\nin keeping with our times:\nbeing able to make your partner feel amazing will make\nthem less likely to stray, and\nmore likely to want to return\nthe favour.\nThe evolutionary biology of the female orgasm\n\u201cGays, lesbians and\nbisexuals are at a\ngreater risk of mental\ndisorder and deliberate\nself-harm than\nheterosexuals...\u201d\nDR JAMES WARNER\nThanks to the Felix in-house model for kindly demonstrating\n\u201cA more likely reason\nfor female orgasms is\nincentive: she will be\nmore likely to have sex\nwith her man again...\u201d\n\n"

Gerardo\napplied his language skills\nand discovered that the men\nin tights were three eighths\nof the entire Cave Rescue\nOrganisation for the Balearic\nIslands, doing a light spot of\ntraining for the day.\nThey shot up the mountainside and we waddled slowly after them, following the\nmany cairns along the ridge\nwalk, then the vast quantities\nof red spray paint around to\nthe entrance. The limestone\nwas sharp but grippy, though\nif you stumbled on the scree it\nwas an awful long way to the\nvalley floor!\nAs we caught up with\nthe Cave Rescuers at the\nentrance, we eyed up each\nother with equal bemuse-ment \u2013 us with disbelief at\ntheir shiny scratch-free Pretzl\nmetalwork, them at the sight\nof the finest Yorkshire mud\nthat we had imported into\nthe country. I really wonder\nwhether UK cavers have an\nentirely inverted view of caving equipment compared to\nthe rest of the world. We view\nnew, shiny kit with suspicion\nand an assumption of inex-perience, whereas the continent sees inexperience in not\nkeeping every item gleaming\nand serviced.\nEntrance pitch was a pleasant daylight 10m abseil down\na steep slope into what would\nbe a very large chamber\nindeed for the UK \u2013 something you could easily squeeze\nBeit into. Once everyone was\nsafely down, we wandered\naround the corner into the\ncave itself.\nBig doesn\u2019t even start to\ndescribe it. There were enormous formations, stalagmites\nand flow stone (a smooth\ncalcite deposit) larger than\nhouses, curtains (lines of\nmoulded together stalactites)\nlarger than a fa\u00e7ade on Oxford\nStreet, and gour pools (crystal\npools formed by water dropping onto flow stone) that\nwould have seemed more\nat home on Brighton beach.\nAmazing stuff.\nWe orbited the little tea-lights showing our path back\nout of the chamber, calling to\neach other across the many-second echo and generally\nexploring this wholly out-of-this-world landscape. The\nchamber is the size of four\nfootball pitches side by side,\nand tall enough to consume\nthe Blackett Laboratory.\nWe continued down on\nrope, along a 60m long piece\nof smooth flow stone that\nstarted out horizontal, then\ngot steadily steeper until\nalmost vertical \u2013 not a place\nfor the unwary! Just beyond,\nthere is a little muddy cham-ber, absolutely filled with\ncandles from previous cave\ntrips. We cracked open our\nDarren drum of baguettes, a\nvery pleasant lunch by can-dlelight!\nThe rest of the extensive\ncave is reached by crawling through a gap not much\nlarger than a television, and\nhere you can notice the very\nstrange \u2018breathing\u2019 of the\ncave. Three seconds breathe\nin, two seconds hold, three\nseconds breathe out. The\nvery bottom is just three\nmetres above sea level, and\nit is believed that there is a\nsubmarine tunnel too small\nfor a human (or merely as yet\nundiscovered) connecting the\ncave with the sea, resulting\nin the Mediterranean waves\ncausing air to be sucked\nin and out. Truly a freak of\nnature!\nThe speedy Spaniards soon\novertook us coming the other\nway, and after sorting out the\ninevitable cat\u2019s cradle of rigging when two groups do the\nsame cave, we decided it was\ngetting late and so began our\nascent. It was Gerardo and\nPella\u2019s first SRT [rope] trip,\nso progress was fairly sedate\nbut very pleasant.\nThe sunshine was glorious\nas we exited, gobbling bananas and Haribo before ambling\nalong the 90 minutes of steep\nmountain back to our cars.\nWe drove on to the seaside\nresort, sitting outside for a\ncoffee in the gathering twi-light. While having a hopping\nrace from the beachfront back\nto the cars, we bumped into\nthe Rescuers staying in the\nresort overnight, managing\na stilted conversation about\nthe size and impressiveness\nof the cave while pretending\nnot to huff and puff from our\nwacky race.\nICCC is planing to run one\nlast weekend trip this year\nsuitable for first-timers.\nExact date TBA, but some\ntime in June \u2013 see our website for more info: www.union.\nic.ac.uk/caving.\nCAVING CLUB\nSa Compana: out of this world\nImperial College Caving Club visited the largest cave on Mallorca\nImperial College Caving Club standing outside the rather inconspicuous entrance to\nSa Compana.

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nKeiran Hebden\u2019s Four Tet guise\nhas slyly converted many guitar-worshipping indie kids to his slinky\nand beguiling mixture of folk and\nelectronica (I know, I am one), with\n2003\u2019s Rounds providing laid-back\njams, dancefloor-humping beats\nand the nine-minute epic Unspoken\nearning him seemingly endless critical acclaim.\nExpectations are riding high on\nthis, his fourth album on Domino. In\nthe intervening years, Hebden has\nprofessed an intense dislike for the\nterm \u2018folktronica\u2019 that was foisted\nupon him by general critical opin-ion, while producing his friend Dan\nSnaith\u2019s band, Manitoba (now known\nas Caribou due to a ridiculous conflict with a punk singer, Handsome\nDick Manitoba). In short, anyone\nexpecting a straight-out repeat of\nRounds\u2019 mostly acoustic fare will\nbe sorely disappointed. Hebden has\nmade it clear time and time again\nthat he falls in the class of artists that believe only progression\nis worthwhile \u2013 witness his earlier incarnation in the band Fridge,\nformed at the tender age of fifteen,\nwho veered from Krautrock to post-rock to you-name-it on their two\nvastly unappreciated records.\nThe single, Smile Around The\nFace, is constructed around a\nChipmunk-sounding soul vocal and\ncrashing live drums that clearly owe\na lot to his work with Caribou. Pretty\ntoy xylophones jump from speaker\nto speaker, as the sample is cut\nin/out against splashy cymbals and\ntight snares. The cohesive moments\nprovide a hook that\u2019s almost pop in\nit\u2019s simplicity and child-like glee.\nAnd Then Patterns\u2019 opening laid-back and deceptively complex beat\nharks back to the downtempo sound\nof Rounds. A pretty piano figure\nwinds around phasing synth lines\nand slowly draws you into the warm\nsoundscape of crackling sounds and\nfaraway-sounding vocal samples.\nHebden has professed a love for\nlast year\u2019s MF Doom and Madlib\ncollaboration, Madvilliany, and\nrecently worked on an EP of remixes\ndue for release soon. Hearing them\nbrings it home how much Four Tet\u2019s\nsnappy beats and cymbals owe to\nhiphop production \u2013 High Fives has\na punchy, tense drum pattern that\u2019s\nvaguely reminiscent of Prefuse 73\u2019s\ninstru-hop. Again, the sheer inventiveness of the production is enough\nto keep the listener\u2019s attention,\nrephrasing the warped xylophone\nsounds of Rounds opener, Hands,\ninto a hummable melody.\nThe undisputed high point of this\nalbum is Sun Drums And Soil. It\nstarts with Boards Of Canada-esque\nsynth washes and gentle bleeps,\nbefore Hebden loses his restraint\nand brings in a huge cymbal-break-ing beat that\u2019s straight out of the\nCaribou rulebook. Jazz saxophones\nloop and dance on the massive beat,\nwhile warm rhodes piano builds an\nascending melody that\u2019s almost sin-ister. Nothing he\u2019s ever done sounds\nlike this. It instantly calls to mind\nBoom Bip, who tend to merge postrock\u2019s love of severe volume changes with downbeat electronica. Boom\nBip never had the utterly sublime\nproduction that this record does,\neach beat perfect, each component\nof the mix melding seamlessly with\nits neighbours.\nSleep, Eat Food, Have Visions is\ninteresting in that it spends three\nminutes being a laidback bleep-fest,\nwhile the remaining five minutes\n\u2013 a hammering drill\u2019n\u2019bass \u2013 work\nout with roughly a billion drum\nsounds all crushed into one beat.\nIn that way, it\u2019s akin to the opener,\nJoy, which mauls listeners with its\nhuge, evil bassline. It\u2019s almost as if\nHebden wants to refute the possible\ncoffee-tableness of Rounds.\nThis is probably the best IDM\nrecord that\u2019ll be released this year;\na thoughtful mix of charming melo-dies, sophisticated production, and\nsheer ingenuity. Stick it on repeat.\nAndrew Sykes\nMusic Editor\nEverything eclectic\nFour Tet\u2019s new album proves that \u2018new directions\u2019 aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, and we\npresent alternatives to the big festivals (since they\u2019ve all sold out, boo hoo)\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 12 May 2005\n14\nFour Tet\nEverything Ecstatic\n(Domino)\nHHHHI\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nFour Tet: even laptop geniuses have to go outside sometimes\nNo Glasto ticket?

But most are a danger to no-one, and some abnormalities in behaviour can lead to highly creative phases. So why do we lock them up?\nAMERICA ON EVOLUTION\n\u201cEvolution is as well-documented as any\nphenomenon in science, as strongly as the\nEarth\u2019s revolution around the Sun rather than\nvice versa. In this sense, we can call\nevolution a fact\u201d\nStephen Jay Gould, Harvard paleontologist\n\u201cAll the ills from which America suffers can be\ntraced back to the teaching of evolution\u201d\nThree time democratic candidate for the presidency,\nWilliam Jennings, 1925\n\u201cThe monkey mythology of Darwin is the\ncause of permissiveness, promiscuity, pills,\nprophylactics, perversions, abortion,\npornotherapy, pollution, poisoning and\nproliferation of crimes of all types\u201d\nJudge Braswell Dean of the Georgia State Court\nof Appeals, 1981\n\u201cI\u2019d make it a goal to make sure that local folks\ngot to make the decision as to whether or not\nthey said creationism has been a part of our\nhistory\u201d\nGeorge W Bush, Associated Press\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really care about that kind of thing\u201d\nGoerge W Bush\u2019s views on evolution, according to a friend\n(NY Times, October 2000)\nStephen J Gould\nGeorge W Bush\nCharles Darwin has finally\nbeen brought face to face\nwith the religious authorities.\nDespite never being tried in\nhis own lifetime, last week the\nKansas Board of Education\nbegan making their case\nagainst the father of modern\nevolutionary theory.\nThe courtroom took evidence from six anti-evolu-tion scientists arguing that\nDarwin was guilty of proliferating a theory that fails\nto explain gaps in the fossil record, the complexity of\nDNA, or the origin of life.\nOutside,boycottingthetrial,\nirate mainstream scientists\ndemonstrated against the\nproceedings \u2013 but in vain. The\nState Board of Education\u2019s\nconservative majority is set\nto push through legislation\nensuring that pupils are\ntaught to challenge the basic\nprecepts of evolution.\nOne of the witnesses at trial,\nJonathan Wells, explains his\nmotivation: \u201cFather\u2019s words,\nmy studies and my prayers\nconvinced me that I should\ndevote my life to destroying\nDarwinism.\u201d Dr Wells is an\nembryologist and senior fellow at the Discovery Institute\nin Seattle.\nThe witnesses for the prosecution in the Kansas trial\ninclude William Harris, a professor of medicine, who said\nthat Darwinism clashed with\nthe biblical teaching that life\nwas created by God. \u201cPart of\nour overall goal is to remove\nthe bias against religion that\nis currently in schools,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThis is a scientific controversy that has powerful\nreligious implications.\u201d\nUp until now, \u2018creation science\u2019 has lost every legal\nchallenge associated with\nthe creationism-evolution\ndebate.\nIn 1982, a federal judge\nruled that \u2018creation science\u2019\nhas no scientific significance\nand is merely an attempt to\npromote religion. In 1987 the\nsupreme court ruled that biblical creationism must not be\ntaught in tandem with evolution in the US. Even so,\ncreationism continues to be\ntaught in many schools.\nCreationists have, there-fore, been forced to adapt\ntheir tactics. Theories of\n\u2018intelligent design\u2019 are\nbecoming more popular as\na substitute for the banned\nliteral interpretation of the\nBible. \u2018Intelligent design\u2019\nposits that life\u2019s complexity\ncannot be explained without\na supernatural creator or\narchitect. Earlier this year, a\nhigh school in Pennsylvania\nmade history by becoming\nthe first in the country to\ndiscuss teaching \u2018intelligent\ndesign\u2019. Critics suggested\nthat this is simply a backdoor to allowing non-empiri-cal creationist theories to be\ntaught.\nWith legislators in Alabama\nand Georgia also considering Bills to allow teachers to\nchallenge Darwin in class,\nmillions of schoolchildren\nin the United States will be\ntaught to question Darwin\u2019s\ntheory of evolution by natural selection. Christian fundamentalist activists have\nensured that non-empirical\n\u2018guiding-hand\u2019 teleological\nexplanations will be taught\nalongside established scientific theories of evolution.\nIn parts of the US, it\nappears that religious and\nscientific education are now\noverlapping. After all these\nyears, the ideas propounded in Darwin 1859 book The\nOrigin Of The Species have\nfailed to gain the acceptance of the moral majority.\nTo many Americans, it seems\nthat nothing could be more\nsubversive than suggesting\nthat humans are apes.\n\u201c...my prayers\nconvinced me that I\nshould devote my life\nto destroying\nDarwinism\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Since it is directed by Ridley Scott\n(Gladiator), one would expect\nKingdom of Heaven to impress and\namaze just as much as its predeces-sor. In this respect, the film does\nnot fail to please \u2013 sweeping battle\nscenes, opulent sets and on location\nshooting certainly make for astounding pieces of cinematography, which\nis the main reason for the three star\nrating. Visually, you can expect all\nthe brilliance of Gladiator, only fitted in with a different genre \u2013 one\nof the Christian and Muslim armies\nagainst the backdrop of Jerusalem.\nThe film follows the story of Balian\n(Orlando Bloom), a French blacksmith in mourning after the suicide\nof his wife, who one day decides\nto ride to Jerusalem after being\napproached by the father he never\nknew (Liam Neeson) and urged to\njoin the Crusades.\nUnfortunately en route to\nJerusalem, Bailan\u2019s father Godfrey\nis killed, leaving Balian the sole\nbeneficiary and heir of his men and\nlands in the holy city. While the\nfather lies dying, he knights his son\nand charges him with safeguarding\nthe fragile peace in the city, protecting the helpless and serving the\nleprosy-afflicted king with loyalty.\nThis he does, speedily evolving\nfrom simple mourning blacksmith\nto skilled swordsman, irrigation\nexpert, surveyor, builder, military\nstrategist and politician, whilst also\nfinding time to bed the beautiful\n(and married) Princess Sibylla.\nWhat a multitalented blacksmith.\nThere are two major failings of\nthe film that prevented it from truly\nreaching \u2018epic\u2019 status. Number one\nwas the fact that the plot was riddled with more holes than Swiss\ncheese. Balian\u2019s knowledge of irrigation and military expertise seem\nto appear from nowhere. A possible\n(and likely) explanation is that progression took a long time; however,\nthe film does not give this impres-sion.\nProblem number two is Balian\nhimself. Ridley Scott appears to give\nBloom as much screen time as pos-sible, and this proves to be a huge\nfailing, mainly because of his lack\nof screen presence. The camera is\nlittle more than a terrier trailing\nBalian. True, the film is about one\nman\u2019s journey and his rude awakening into the world of intertwined\nreligion, politics and war; but the\nfilm\u2019s scope seems to omit anything\nthat has no immediate impact on\nthe central character, whose impassive attitude that he put to good use\nas a detached and well-spoken elf\nhas been used throughout the film.\nIn fact, he has no other attitude, his\nface is always a picture of constant\nconsternation and grim determina-tion. His lines are kept to a bare\nminimum to save him from embarrassing himself, yet he does just\nthat. His delivery is invariably terse\nand over-dramatic.\nWhilst some scenes were historically inaccurate and some battle\nscenes were a bit too drawn out for\nmy liking, this film was certainly\nnot offensive to watch and provided plenty of conversation material\nafterwards. The dialogue was poign-ant, with the supporting cast delivering strong performances on all\nfronts. Scott dealt with the issue of\nthe Crusades sensitively and in such\na manner that neither Christians\nnor Muslims were demonised. The\nfilm also raises interesting parallels\nbetween the struggle in the holy\nland back in 1180 and events in the\nMiddle East today.\nMarya Ziauddin\nand Alistair Finn\nScott fails to deliver\nKingdom Of Heaven falls into the shadow of masterpiece Gladiator\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 12 May 2005\n16\nKingdom Of Heaven\nDirector: Ridley Scott\nStarring: Orlando Bloom, Eva Green,\nLiam Neeson, Jeremy Irons\nRunning time: 150 mins\nCertificate: 15\nHHHII\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nOrlando Bloom, as Balian, turns from blacksmith to crusader\nListings: page 12\n\u201c...certainly not\noffensive to watch,\nand provided plenty\nof conversation\nmaterial...\u201d\nAs part of the release of Star Wars\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith,\n20th Century Fox have generously\nprovided you with the opportunity\nto win one of three t-shirts and\none of ten posters.\nTo win, just answer this:\nWho has starred in the most Star\nWars movies?\n(a) Yoda\n(b) Darth Vader\n(c) Chewbacca\nEmail your answer to film.felix@\nic.ac.uk.

    "content": "NEWS FEATURE: CAMPUS FOOD felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 12 May 2005 3\nMuch has been said and written about the cost of a decent\nsandwich around campus,\nin particular the over-priced\nbread-based offerings in\nthe JCR. However, a few\nmoments\u2019 research shows\nthat buying your lunch on the\nwalkway might not just be\ndamaging your pocket, but\nyour health as well.\nSalt is a chemical that we\nare all familiar with, and\nthere can\u2019t be many people\nat Imperial who aren\u2019t aware\nthat it is composed of sodium and chlorine, two rather\nnasty elements.\nIf your sodium levels are too\nhigh, your body retains too\nmuch water, causing blood\npressure to rise and putting\nstrain on the heart. As the\nCASH (Consensus Action\non Salt and Health) website\nclaims, \u201cit is also widely recognised that a high salt diet\nhas other adverse effects,\nsuch as osteoporosis, asth-ma, and is closely linked to\ncancer of the stomach. There\nis also evidence that a high\nsalt intake in childhood may\npredispose us to getting high\nblood pressure later in life.\nAll in all, it seems that too\nmuch salt isn\u2019t good for you.\nGovernment recommendations for daily intake tell us\nthat we should consume less\nthan 6g of salt per day.\nThe Institute of Medicine\nsuggests that \u201chealthy 19- to\n50-year-old adults should consume 3.8 grams of salt a day,\nto replace the amount lost\ndaily on average\u201d and places\nan upper limit \u201cthat people\nshould not exceed\u201d at 5.8g.\nHowever, it isn\u2019t always\nobvious exactly how much\nsalt a product contains, as\nusually only the sodium level\nis quoted on the packaging.\nFear not, Imperial students,\nfor a moment alone with a\nperiodic table reassures you\nthat to convert sodium weight\ninto salt weight you just have\nto multiply by about 2.5.\nBack in the JCR, I\u2019m\nmunching on a fairly tasty\n(but overpriced) lunchtime\nmeal of Caf\u00e9 Life\u2019s \u2018Breakfast\nWrapped Up\u2019, along with\na packet of salt and vinegar McCoy\u2019s. Which one\nhas more salt? The crisps?\nWrong. A few scrawlings on\na piece of paper (calculators\nare for wimps) reveals that\nthe sandwich contains 4.25g\nof salt and the crisps 2.75g.\nThat\u2019s a total of 7g of salt, and\nso assuming I had a sensible\nbreakfast I\u2019m well over my\ndaily allowance already. By\nthe way, 7g is roughly equivalent to drinking 700ml of\nAtlantic seawater. Tasty.\nIs this surprising? Few people would look at \u2018Breakfast\nWrapped Up\u2019 and assume\nthat this sausage, egg and\nbacon wrap is healthy, but\nmost would put that down\nto fat content. However, the\nfact that this sandwich has\n55% more salt than the crisps\nshocked me.\nThis sandwich is by no\nmeans the only one in the\nJCR that might cause health\nproblems if you ate there\nevery day. Most sandwiches I\nsaw contained between 1 and\n1.3 grams of sodium (or 2.5 to\n4 grams of salt): around half\nof your daily allowance, even\nwithout the crisps.\nIn practice, it may be difficult to reduce the amount\nof salt in your diet, simply\nbecause there is so much of it\nin processed food. According\nto dietician Rosie Taylor, \u201cit\ncan be difficult to ensure a\nlow salt diet. This is because\n65-75% of the salt we consume is from hidden sources\n\u2013 processed foods or naturally occuring in foods. Only\nabout 15% of the salt we eat\nis added during cooking or at\nthe table.\u201d\nHowever, this is an issue\nthat the Government is taking\nseriously. Taylor continues:\n\u201cThe Government are now in\ndiscussions with food manufacturers to decide ways of\nreducing the salt content of\nfoods over time, so that this\ntarget of 6g can be reached\u201d\nThe levels of salt in some\nJCR sandwiches are very\nworrying, and there are\nclearly health risks involved.\nThe least they could do is\nlower the price \u2013 then we\ncould save up for the nursing\nwe might need in later life.\n\u25cf Government health\nrecommendations\nregarding salt intake:\nwww.salt.gov.uk\nThe high salt content of College life\n\u201cBuying your lunch on\nthe walkway might not\njust be damaging your\npocket, but your health\nas well\u201d\nAre you getting the best health value out of your food on campus? Martin Smith had lunch in the\nJCR, read the Government\u2019s recommendations on salt content, and was shocked by what he found\nSOME \u2018READY SALTED\u2019 FACTS\n75%of salt we eat comes from processed food\n6gis the maximum amount of salt the Government\nsays you should consume each day\n85%of men and 69%of women in the UK\nhave too much salt\nJCR shop: rip-off merchant or just misunderstood?\nThe importance of good nutrition is nothing new. Back in\n400BC, Hippocrates said:\n\u201cLet food be your medicine\nand medicine be your food.\u201d\nAs a population, our lifestyles and eating habits have\nchanged drastically over the\npast couple of decades. The\nenvironment we live in has\nalso changed, with the ever-increasing availability of food\nat all hours of the day, from\ntakeaways and home deliveries to supermarket ready\nmeals, we have become a\npopulation of fast food lov-ers. And it\u2019s impacting on our\nhealth.\nLinks between diet and disease are better understood\nthan ever before, and there\nis a large body of evidence\nshowing that what you eat\nhas an enormous impact on\nyour health. Today, at least\nfour of the ten leading causes\nof death in the UK \u2013 heart\ndisease, cancer, stroke and\ndiabetes \u2013 are directly related\nto the way we eat, and diet is\nalso implicated in scores of\nother conditions. We mustn\u2019t\nunderestimate the influence\non our health of how and what\nwe eat.\nYet, whilst awareness is\nincreasing about the role diet\ncan play in promoting good\nhealth and reducing the risk\nof certain diseases, it seems\nthat healthy intentions are\noften hampered as a result of\nthe food available to people at\ntheir places of work, or, in the\ncases of students at Imperial,\ntheir places of study.\nAs the Felix survey has\nshown, there is demand for\nhealthy food at Imperial. So\nare we being let down by\nthose who supply the food?\nDo universities need a \u2018school\ndinners\u2019 style visit from Jamie\nOliver to banish the chips and\nbring in the salads?\nI think not. There are\nunhealthy foods available on\ncampus \u2013 take the salt-rid-den meaty sandwich from the\nJCR or the rows of chocolate\nbars and sugar-laden drinks\nin the walkway newsagent,\nand of course you\u2019ll end up\nwith a pretty dire lunch, lacking in vitamins and fibre, and\nriddled with sugar and fat.\nOn the other hand, buying a\ncouple of pieces of fresh fruit\nand a bottle of water from\nthe JCR before taking a short\nwalk across Prince Consort\nRoad to buy a hot jacket potato and baked beans would\ngive you an altogether different kind of meal. As the mantra of my fellow dieticians\nacross the country goes, \u201cno\nfoods should be banned from\na healthy diet, it\u2019s about variety and moderation\u201d.\nSo, I would like to argue\nthe case for \u2013 along with a\nreduction in salt added to\nprocessed foods by manufacturers \u2013 improved nutritional\nlabelling on foods: something\nthe Food Standards Agency\n(FSA) are currently developing a \u2018signposting\u2019 system\nfor. I believe that the College\nshould continue to provide\na wide selection of foods, so\nthat the individual can make\ntheir own informed choice\nabout the way they eat, but\nperhaps they could do more\nto highlight to us busy and\npreoccupied students just\nwhich options are the healthi-est.\nThis problem will be partially solved when the FSA\u2019s\nnew signposting system\nis launched. This will not,\nhowever, apply to foods that\nare freshly prepared and so\ncome unpackaged. It is here\nthat I think the university\ncould have a big impact on\ninforming its students about\nhealthy options. Who knows\nwhat effect it could have\n\u2013 improved exam results as\na consequence of improved\nconcentration, perhaps?\nFood counts towards whether you pass or fail exams. Dietician\nRosie Taylor explains why you should care about what you eat\nA demand for healthy food\nJCR SHOP PRICE CHECK\nWe compared prices at the JCR Shop with three local high\nstreet stores. The figures speak for themselves, yet eating in\nthe JCR remains a popular option\nJCR SHOP (after 10% student discount)\nChicken and bacon Caesar salad sandwich \u00a32.70\nClassic BLT sandwich \u00a32.34\nHam, cheese and coleslaw sandwich \u00a31.70\n330ml can of Coca-Cola 59p\nBOOTS, GLOUCESTER ROAD\n\u2018Delicious\u2019 BLT sandwich \u00a32.00\nHam and mustard sandwich \u00a31.40\n2 x 500ml bottles of Coca-Cola \u00a31.29\nTHE SANDWICH SHOP, GLOUCESTER ROAD\nAll pre-packed sandwiches \u00a31 to \u00a31.60\n330ml can of Coca-Cola 50p\nMARKS & SPENCER, HIGH STREET KENSINGTON\nRoast chicken salad sandwich \u00a31.60\nTuna and cucumber sandwich \u00a31.40\n\u201cDo universities need\na \u2018school dinners\u2019 style\nvisit from Jamie Oliver\nto banish the chips and\nbring in the salads?\u201d\nFelix food survey:\nthe results\nDo you think the food\nsold on campus is good\nvalue for money?\nDo you think the food\nsold on campus is\nhealthy?\nWould you be interested\nin healthier options than\nalready exist?\nDo you ever consider\nnutritional content\nwhen you buy food?\nYes\nNo\nDon\u2019t know\nYes\nNo\nDon\u2019t know\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nSometimes\nFelix spoke to 100 students at a variety of locations across the\nSouth Kensington campus on Tuesday 10 May\n\n"

By the students & for\nthe students, not by a consultant to\nscrew as much money out of the students to pay for more consultants!\nThe idea of somehow squeezing\nthe gym into the clearly diminutive\neast basement is obscene, and no\nextent of buying colour coded chairs\n& glass topped wine bars will make\nup for it.\nYours,\nJarvist Frost\nPhysics III\nDear Felix,\nYour double page spread in last edition 1321 on the future of the Union\nbuilding included plans (which were\ndifficult to read) for each floor in the\nUnion building.\nWhat surprised me about the\nplans was the indication that the\nUnion Gym, which is currently\nused by many and diverse Clubs\nand Societies looks as though it will\nbe replaced with Union offices. So\nwhere will all the Clubs that currently use the Gym go when the\nUnion Gym is used to house all the\ncomputers Mr Arif needs for his\nelectronic ballots?\nInto the newly built Sports Centre\nat commercial rates? I understand\nthat the Sports Centre has a strict\nmandate to make money out of providing services to the wider com-munity, as well as the students at\nImperial, and needs to allocate time\nduring the week to be able to do this,\npenalising student usage.\nBut why do we need Union offices\nmoved from their present location\non level 1 to occupy twice the floor\nspace on levels 2 and 3? The answer\nin the plans is that there will be\nanother bar built on level 1. So four\nfood/drink outlets in one building,\ninstead of three, to displace a sporting asset, the Gym.\nUnusually, the President is reticent about how this could have\nhappened, after a motion passed\nin December by the Union Council\nexpressly ruled out the loss of the\nUnion Gym as a facility for students.\nWith the Southside Gym about to\nshut, and ever increasing numbers\nof indebted students turning to hobbies and sport instead of drinking\nto enjoy themselves outside of lec-tures, it strikes me that this course\nof action in the Union building is\nhighly risky. He insisted to me that\nthe Union would be able to pay for\nextra space in the new Sports Centre\nfor Clubs \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure how. The\nsubsidy that the Union gives Clubs\nfell last year.\nIf you need facilities in the Union\nthat are under threat of demolition,\nwrite to them and tell them! If you\u2019re\nin the Fencing club, unsheath your\npens and let them know! If you play\nsnooker, leave your balls on the table\nand break theirs for once! If you\npractice any sort of martial art (and\nI hear a lot of it going on these days!)\nit\u2019s time to apply self-defence to the\nvenue you use, not just your own\nbodies!\nyoursay@ic.ac.uk\nGood Luck!\nTom Tibbits\nPhysics PG\nRichard Walker, Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies), responds:\nThe Union building redevelopment project is one of the most\nexciting projects that I have been\ninvolved in during my time as\nDeputy President. Following the\ndevelopment of the Union strategy\nthat cemented the core objectives\nof what our Union should strive to\nachieve, it is an important step to\nlook at redeveloping the inside of\nthe Union building, one of the finest\non campus, into one that can facilitate those objectives.\nIt was students that decided\nhow much should be spent on this\ndesign project, it was students that\ndecided its scope and it is students\nthat are managing the project and\nstudents that are constructing the\nbrief and prioritising what is best\nfor students.\nWhat I, we, the Union are about\nto create is a Union building that\nhas at its heart clubs and societies\nand social space that will become a\nplace where students can balance\ntheir academic work life with their\noutside life.\nWhen there are huge demands\non space in area such as South\nKensington I, we, the Union must\nuse what we have with great care.\nWe have a responsibility to each\nother not to be wasteful. Relocating\noffice space and student service\nspace to work next to each other\nallows us not only to share space,\nbut to work together and involve\nmore students. Relocating gym\nhall activity to a single height area\nwhich allows the same activity to\ncontinue without detriment allows\nus to extend mezzanine levels to\ncreate added floor space for more\nstudent activity.\nI am proud of the passion that\nImperial students have for their\nUnion and I am humbled to be a\npart of it. I have listened to your\ncomments and I urge you to keep\nthem coming and I hope that then\nI, we, the Union will create a better\nplace for us all.\nKicking up a Stormy\nDear Ed,\nI was slightly disturbed by Stormy\nWoods\u2019 article this week. While I\nappreciate that she might not be\nshort of attention in recent times,\nis there any particular reason why\nshe goes out of her way to typecast the gentleman accosting her on\nthe bus as a \u2018geriatric arab illegal\nimmigrant\u2019? And no less on voting\nday! While she herself might not\ncare much for the political parties\u2019\nattitudes towards immigration, her\ninsta-judgement of the average mid-dle-eastern man in the street being\npast their 50\u2019s and possessing no\nright of abode in the UK leaves me\nquestioning why so many foreigners would want to come here in the\nfirst place, at least in their home\ncountries they aren\u2019t lambasted and\nstereotyped in such a dismissive\nway!\nThere are more appealing ways\nto try and emulate the Sex and\nthe City-esque columns that she is\nundoubtedly aiming for and from\nwhat I gather Stormy\u2019s plans are\nto venture into the medical profes-sion. She would do well to learn\nsome manners and tact to go with\nher \u2018perfectly tanned hairless pins\u2019\n(I\u2019ll have to take her word on this\nas I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to\nsee for myself) before being allowed\nto see patients, or is she going to\npick and choose who she sees and\ntreats and see that as acceptable\npractice??\nI\u2019ve enjoyed some of Stormy\u2019s col-umns, and I\u2019ve disagreed with some;\nbut this one I feel has pushed the\nboat too far. It\u2019s not big, it\u2019s not cool\nand to be honest it\u2019s not right to\njudge people the way she has. As for\nthe cat getting the cream, perhaps\nit was the only way to stop her from\nmaking another self-centred, tactless comment.\nRegards,\nTim Aplin\nAeronautics IV\nDear Editor,\nIn reply to this week\u2019s issue of Felix,\nI\u2019d like to express my disappointment at Ms Woods\u2019 lack of tact in a\ntime where immigration and racial\nprejudice are sensitive topics.\nFirst of all unless a document was\npresented by the man in question\nduring Ms Woods\u2019 30 seconds of\nfame \u2013 and i doubt it \u2013 stating he was\nand i quote \u201can illegal immigrant\u201d i\nbelieve it\u2019s a borderline-racist and\ntactless comment to make particularly when it coincides with election\ntime.\nI would expect better from a future\ndoctor studying at a respected uni-versity. Having a foreign accent\ndoesn\u2019t mean you are an illegal\nimmigrant and cannot afford a plane\nticket to visit London or any other\ncity in the world for that matter.\nFrom a woman\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s\ntrue that some men (regardless\nof their nationality) have a rather\nunsubtle and unattractive way of\nshowing interest, i have had my\nshare! However, advertising perfectly tanned legs in a skirt and three\ninch heels calls out for attention\nbut a woman cannot choose where\nit comes from; it would be selfish\nand unfair to the opposite sex, i am\nafraid these are the rules. Being\nattractive is not an achievement,\ncuring cancer is.\nRegards,\nName and department supplied\nStormy Woods replies:\nThank you for taking the time\nto write in. My column is apoliti-cal, with much irreverence thrown\nin for entertainment\u2019s sake. Hence,\nelection day did not spring to mind\nwhen I wrote the piece. I\u2019m confident that most Imperial students\nwould have the intelligence to vote\non policies from the parties them-selves, not the politically incorrect\nrantings of an enfant terrible!\nFirst thing\u2019s first: my perfectly-tanned hairless pins, and the prejudice displayed by the pair of you\nwhen reading about them. It is\nperfectly possible to display one\u2019s\nassets without appearing slattern-ly. I should know, being the owner\nof several knee-length Prada skirts,\nas worn on the day of the presenta-tion. I\u2019d like to point out that three-inch heeled fifties pumps \u2013 more\nspecifically, worn with tights and\nsaid skirt \u2013 aren\u2019t automatically\nbecoming of unwanted attention\neither. Especially when worn with\na high neckline, tasteful jewellery,\nno cleavage and a natural sun-kissed glow, courtesy of MAC. Do\nthe words pot, kettle and stereotype\nhave any relevance to you?\nI\u2019m perfectly aware of the perils and pitfalls of typecasting and\nethnicity. Believe me, I\u2019ve had my\nshare. However, numerous women\nat College have had problems with\ngentlemen similar to the chap I\nrejected on the bus, most notably\nthose who reside in North Fulham\nand Edgware Road, on an almost\ndaily basis. To put it bluntly, these\nmen are relatively uncouth and of\nMiddle Eastern or North African\norigin. I wouldn\u2019t have an aversion their existence if they kept\nthemselves to themselves, like similar men of different ethnic origins\ntend to do. Being of foreign origin\nmyself, it\u2019s evident I\u2019d have seen\nthe diverse social strata within my\nethnic group and others \u2013 living in\nLondon means that I would have\nseen affluent Arabs with their beautiful wives aplenty, so insta-judge-ment of those from other cultures\nwith foreign accents is a non-issue.\nI agree that the illegal immigrant\nassertion is unfair \u2013 I got carried\naway with the public perception\nthat the nastier element amongst\nforeginers in the UK must automatically be illegally present, and\napologise for castigating them so\nhastily.\nI would like to conclude by telling\nyou that doctors aren\u2019t infallible.\nWe are human first, medics second.\nThe same goes for the unwashed\ngentleman on the bus \u2013 should he\npay me a visit as a patient, where\nI am confident, he would take a\ndifferent tack. There isn\u2019t a single\nperson who doesn\u2019t harbour preju-dices; what separates bigots from\nthe rest is their failure to suppress\ntheirs.\nAlternative exam rules\nDear Editor,\nFortunately, my finals were early\nthis exam season, but while I\u2019m\nsitting here slowly trying to rehabilitate myself off caffeine, it has\noccurred to me how many things\npissed me off during the exam ses-sions. In an effort to ensure anyone\nwith exams left to go do not have to\nface these annoyances, I have made\na list of rules people should have\nto read and abide to and preferably\nshould be put at the back of every\ncourse book.\nInvigilators:\n\u2022 DON\u2019T walk up and down the\nstairs un-necessarily: The stairs to\nthe stage in the Great Hall are an\ninadequate metal arrangement that\nsqueaks hideously. You know this,\nI know this, so think twice when\ndeciding if it\u2019s truly necessary to\nuse them.\n\u2022 DON\u2019T wear tap shoes: If you\nhave to pace up and down the hall in\nboredom, at least wear trainers or\nsoft soled shoes. This is not a time\nfor your highly individual wooden\nsandals/leather flat shoes that your\nresearch group find so amusing\n(sigh).\n\u2022 DO make sure you\u2019re paying atten-tion: It is not difficult to see a hand in\na group of hunched students. When\nyou see one, at least try to make\nsome semblance of haste in your\nefforts. In addition, I\u2019d like to point\nout another fact, ignoring bathroom\nbreaks, if students put their hands\nup, they generally want one of three\nthings: To know the time, more\npaper, paper fasteners (and possibly\ndoughnuts), can invigilators please\nmake sure they are in possession of\nthese things when they go to investigate hands.\n\u2022 DO put up seat allocations sen-sibly:\nWhen revising, it is not possible to\nremember your candidate number\nor seat location, fact. May I suggest\ntherefore, that putting the list directly beside the door to the hall is a bad\nidea? Just a few meters further back\nwould save many crushed feet.\n\u2022 DO ensure tables don\u2019t wob-ble: Why is this sooooo difficult,\nWWHHHYYY???? The function of\na table is to create a stable level\nsurface, and none of them do this. I\ncan only assume table sellers have\na powerful union and are headed\nby a very evil sadistic man, maybe\nMichael Howard.\nStudents:\n\u2022 DON\u2019T stop to talk in a stupid\nplace: Why do certain people have\na compulsion to stop and talk the\nvery second they leave the exam\nhall? THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF\nPEOPLE BEHIND YOU trying to\nget out of the tiny doors. You are no\nbetter to me than the idiot mothers\nwith prams that stop to talk in the\nmiddle of busy pavements. Pah.\n\u2022 DON\u2019T sigh contentently when\nyou have finished: I haven\u2019t, and it\nmakes me want to throw things.\n\u2022 DO dress sensibly: Girls for exam-ple, you are rubbish and your bladders are weak, accept this and wear\ntrainers not heels, this will significantly reduce walking noise during\nyour toilet breaks. Guys, this may\nbe a personal annoyance, but don\u2019t\ncover yourself in lynx deodorant the\nmorning before. You are not 13 and\napart from trying to ignore the smell,\nI worry that if my table rocks again a\nspark may cause an explosion.\nRight, rant over and good luck\neveryone,\nSebwin\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk by 10pm Monday.

Then in the spring term the\ntendering process for choosing the\narchitects was undertaken, where\nthree architectural companies were\ngiven the opportunity to compete\nfor the job of developing a masterplan for the Union Building. Having\ngiven their presentations to show\nwhy they should be selected, the\ncompany Swanke Hayden Connell\nwere chosen, as they understood\nbest the issues facing our students\nand the Union building and were\nkeen to interact with the students\nthroughout the process.\nFollowing on from this, during the\nEaster holidays a working group\n(made up of Sabbatical Officers,\nExecutive Committee members\nand House Committee members)\nhave been meeting regularly with\nthe Architects about this project,\ndiscussing the current uses of the\nbuilding, the problems facing users\nand oversight of the process. The\narchitects have also been looking at\nthe structural issues that affect the\nbuilding to determine what can and\ncan\u2019t be done.\nLast week\u2019s pullout showed\nsketched design. The pictures did\nnot show what will happen to the\nUnion building but are the initial\ndrawings from the architects which\nthey used in the tendering process.\nThey were given to show their ideas,\nspark discussions and generate\nthoughts in preparation to receiving\nstudent feedback and development\nof the actual brief for the building.\nFocus groups will be held with students to discuss the building and\nhow best it can be redeveloped to\nreach its potential in serving the\nUnion\u2019s students.\nIn June, with all the information\nthat the architects have gathered,\nthey will propose a brief for the\nbuilding to the Union Council, which\nsuggests what different areas of the\nbuilding will be used for. Once this\nis done the process will then be to\nexpand on these ideas, with the help\nof user groups for each of the different areas. In October the architects\nwill give more detailed proposals\nof how each of the different areas\nof the building will be used. These\nwill be publicised and you will be\nconsulted again for feedback. From\nthen until January, the designs for\nthe building will be worked into the\nfinal masterplan.\nDo have a look at the Union\nwebsite; it is intended as an ongoing source of information about the\nproject so that you can keep up\nto date. You can reach it via www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk and give your feedback (yoursay@ic.ac.uk).\n\u25cf Letters to the Editor, page 8\nThe joy of... 24-hour libraries\nAs most of you have probably real-ised, the dreaded exam season has\nhit Imperial College once again. To\nmany, that will mean lack of sleep,\ntoo much caffeine, and a growing\nrealisation that it might have been\na good idea to work a little harder\nthroughout the year. When they\ntold you in October that this year\nwas going to be hard, they actually\nmeant it!\nThis year and last, the summer\nterm has also meant round-the-clock access to the central library,\nthanks to the Union lobbying the\nlibrary service on behalf of the student body.\nWhilst the extended service has\nbeen highly praised, and appreciated by students who value the\nadded flexibility of being able to use\nthe library at any point during the\nrevision period, there have been a\nnumber of consistent complaints.\nThere has been call for better\nventilation, as a continuous stream\nof hard-working students takes its\ntoll on air quality. The library has\nacknowledged this and is currently\nasking the College for more money\nto enable it to address the problem\nproperly over the next couple of\nyears.\nSecondly, there is a lack of\nrefreshments. The library provides some vending machines in\nthe Haldane Collection on level 1\n(where consuming some food and\ndrink allowed), but this is limited\nby space. There are also vending\nmachines in the Junior Common\nRoom, and the Union\u2019s catering\nservice in Beit Quad is still the only\nplace on campus to get decent hot\nmeals until 8.30pm (and later on\nWednesday and Friday evenings).\nOne of the worst complaints is\nregarding the lack of space, particularly when other users are\n\u201creserving\u2019 desks with their bags\nand books. At some points, only two\nthirds of spaces are being actively\nused, but there are none available,\nsince the others are being reserved.\nThe library has tried to combat this\nproblem by asking users to remove\ntheir belongings when they are\ngoing to be absent for extended\nperiods, but this has had limited\nsuccess and there is not sufficient\nstaff to \u2018police\u2019 the library over-night.\nOn behalf of other library users,\nI would like to ask you to be considerate and sensible \u2013 of course,\nit is reasonable to leave your desk\nfor an hour to get lunch, but if you\nare going be gone all night, please\ndo the decent thing and let others use the space. Apart from the\nissue of basic courtesy, some people\nappear to be quite careless with\nvaluable belongings. The library is\nnot your home, and it\u2019s not a good\nidea to leave your laptop or iPod\nunattended.\nI\u2019m sorry if this sounds like a rant\n\u2013 I suppose it is \u2013 but some people\nare getting quite fed up. I quote the\ncomments of one library user on\na feedback form: \u201cI arrive in the\nlibrary at 8-9am and leave at 11pm\nand I can never get an individual\ntable by the window... because they\nleave their stuff overnight.\u201d\nIf you do have any feedback\nabout the library, please contact\nlibrary@imperial.ac.uk or fill in a\nfeedback form in the library.\nBest of luck with your exams!\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nUNCLE SAM\nJudgment day for Babar Ahmad\nOn Tuesday 17 May, the case of\nBabar Ahmad looks set to reach its\nclose, 18 months after events started to unfold. The case is not only\na terrifying and tragic experience\nfor Babar, his family and friends,\nbut also represents a fundamental\nattack on all our rights and civil liberties and is an example of so-called\nBritish \u2018justice\u2019.\nThe ordeal started with Babar\u2019s\narrest in December 2003, an arrest\nfor which there was so little evidence to back up the outrageous\nclaims of Babar being \u2018Osama Bin\nLaden\u2019s London General\u2019 that he\nwas released without charge after\na week of interrogation.\nThere is, however, extremely\nstrong evidence pointing to quite\nserious abuse (including life threatening injuries) inflicted on Babar\nby the arresting officers whilst held\nin his cell. However, the only police\nofficer charged with use of excessive force was recently acquitted by\nthe supposedly \u2018Independent\u2019 Police\nComplaints Commission, who ludicrously claimed that the officer\nconcerned acted \u201cprofessionally\nwith great bravery. We support his\nactions: he should be commended\nand not castigated.\u201d\nFollowing his re-arrest on 5 August\n2004, Babar has now been imprisoned for 6668 hours. He is awaiting\na decision on whether he will be\nextradited to the US. The extradition request is based on weak\nevidence similar to that which led\nto his release after his first arrest,\nexcept now the new extradition law\nmeans that Babar\u2019s defence cannot\nchallenge this. They are merely able\nto argue that Babar should be tried\nin Britain as he would\u2019t face a fair\ntrial in the US.\nWith talk of torture, execution,\nGuantanamo Bay and a highly\nislamophobic post-September 11\nUS legal system, his defence certainly have a strong case. But I\nthink we have to question, given\nthe way Babar\u2019s case has unfolded,\nwhether he is likely to get fair treatment from the British legal system.\nIf there is indeed no new evidence\nobtained since December 2003,\nthen we should be demanding not \u2018a\nfair British trial\u2019 but his immediate\nrelease if the extradition request is\nnot granted.\nThis is the prospect that we face\non 17 May. Of course, Babar is just\none man against the US and British\ngovernments\u2019 political agendas and\ntheir \u2018war of terror\u2019. Of course, all\npersons making decisions (like the\none made to recently shut down\nBabar\u2019s HSBC bank account without justification or warning, from\nwhich he was paying his elderly\nparents\u2019 bills through direct debit)\nare connected to the establishment.\nBut this is also an establishment\nthat is now on the retreat. We saw\nin the general election how Tony\nBlair\u2019s New Labour was punished,\nlargely for the war on terror, both\nabroad in Iraq and at home over\ncivil liberties. This was most notably\nexemplified by the victory of George\nGalloway for the Respect Party in\nBethnal Green and Bow. Labour\u2019s\nmajority was slashed across the\nboard. Babar himself stood from\nbehind bars in Brent North and\nreceived a very respectable 685\nvotes. The campaign to free Babar\nis gathering momentum \u2013 each\ndemonstration is bigger and better\nthan the last.\nWe have to remember that the\njudge, however much tied to the\nestablishment, is just one individual\nwho does not want to make the\nwrong decision. If Babar gets extra-dited, and in years to come the\nabsurdity of that decision is high-lighted, his career will be ruined.\nThe mass demonstrations outside\ncourt and continued high profile\ncampaign can tip the balance here.\nWith this in mind, once again (and\npossibly for the last time) Babar\u2019s\nfriends, family and supporters have\ncalled for everyone to be outside\nBow Magistrates Court, Covent\nGarden, at 10am on Thursday 17\nMay.\nIf the decision goes against us\nand judge agrees to the extradition,\nthen we need to be there in our\nhundreds to let the world know he is\nnot going without a fight. But if the\njudge rules against the extradition\nrequest, then there is a very real\npossibility that Babar will walk free\ninto crowds of his supporters. And\nwhat a glorious sight that would be.\nMake Poverty History\nThe Make Poverty History (MPH)\ncampaign, mentioned in the first\nissue of Felix this term, was successfully launched on Monday at a\nvery well attended meeting. Those\nin attendance heard speakers\nfrom Christian Aid, The Guardian,\nGlobalise Resistance and the NUS\ntalk about the importance of demonstrating at the G8 and putting\npressure on the leaders of the eight\nrichest nations of the world, whose\npolitical agendas result in the status\nquo of global poverty.\nThe next stage of this campaign\nis to take a motion supporting MPH\nto Union Council. That will be done\nthis evening. Anyone in support of\nthis motion (which can be viewed\nat www.union.ic.ac.uk/meetings/\ncouncil/2005/5/12) is requested to\njoin us at Council. We are meeting\nbeforehand, at 6pm in the JCR, to\ndiscuss it.\nCOLIN SMITH\nWELFARE CAMPAIGNS\nOFFICER\nSAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(FINANCE & SERVICES)\n& RICHARD WALKER\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(CLUBS & SOCIETIES)\n\n"
