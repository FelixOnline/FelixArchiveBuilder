Wooldridge\nThis June the World Gliding\nChampionships are being held at\nSouth Terney in Gloucestershire.\nThough no I.C. students will be\nflying in the championships the\nclub will be well represented in\nother ways since the Club's single\nseater \" Skylark 4,\" together with\nvan, trailer and I.C. driver, is\nbeing hired out to the Finnish\nteam.\nClub Captain, Bill Bailey, also\nhopes to do well out of the\nChamp's since he is crewing for\nthe Irish team. After the championships are'over a party of I.C. members and gliders will be setting out on an expedition to\nAustria for some mountain soar-ing.\nBetween now and the above\nevents .there will be the usual\ngliding at Lasham, including two,\nweek-long courses for dual and\nsolo pilots at Easter. The Club\nhas already done some soaring\nthis year. Last week-end (March\n6th/7 th) the woods around Lasham proved to be warmer than\nthe surrounding snow-covered\nfields and hence gave rise to\n\" thermals.\" Several club members stayed up for at least an\nhour.\nIf any readers would like to\ncome and see what gliding is all\nabout, they would be welcome at\nLasham. (A joy-ride in the\n\"Eagle\" costs approximately 9/-).\nI.C. Cricket Club would like\nto announce that Freshers' and\nSeniors' trials lists are up on the\nnotice board.\nAH those interested in playing\nshould sign these lists. Trials\n28th at Hariington.\nRugby\nPARIS MEETS\nVON SPIERO\nFriday 12th March saw I.C. Von Spiero's XV on their way to\nParis to pit rugby skill against the\nUniversity. After being met at\nthe station by University officials,\nthe night was spent in the Ecole\ndes Mines..\nSaturday morning brought\nmixed feelings, and the team set\nout for the University Club\nground. On arrival it was found\nthat the game was to be played in\na first-class stadium. Then, when\nthe I.C. team realised that the\nopposition was the mighty P.U. C.4 th XV, bricks appeared in pro-fusion.\nHARD WORK\nThe game was nard, the I.C. team taking a long time to settle\ndown\u2014hence the half-time score\nof 3-10. After the interval, how-ever, Von Spiero's XV found their\nusual form, fast open rugby en-suing. Total effort by all Spiero's brought the score to 19-19, this\nbeing the final result.\nRugby\nTurner\nThe 1964-65 rugby season can\nbe summed up by the phrase \" so\nnear and yet so far.\"\nThe club was on the verge of\nregaining supremacy in the Gutteridge Cup and also having one\nof the best playing records for de-cade s. The fate of both these\nventures, however, came to an\nabrupt halt that fresh spring day\nwhen Q. M.C.'s penalty kick sailed\nbetween the posts, up until then\nthe club had had a tremendous\nseason as the record of 19 wins in\n24 games had shown. Not only\nhad the 1st team been winning but\nit jia d been scoring many points\nand conceding few. The Wednesday record read 230 for-17 against\nin 11 matches. Crushing victories\nover Wasps, Vandalls (the first\ntime in 13 years) Kings College\nHospital, and Sandhurst had\nproved beyond doubt that I.C. had a team with immense potential. It was not therefore, without\njustification, that I.C. took the\nfield against Q.M. C., confident of\nvictory. All dreams, however,\nwere shattered in a fatal 8 minutes\nin the second half. When Q.M. C. fought back to take the lead,\nwhich they held to the end.\nurns Up\nAfter the cup a lethargy set in;\nthe number in the defeats column\ndoubled while only a solitary victory was recorded. Even in defeat-however, I.C. were never dis-graced, never conceding more\nthan two tries and never losing\nby mo e than 8 points.\nGood Name\nRestored\nPerhaps people will say\nthe Ru j by Club has failed again\nthis year. This I can say with\ngreat conviction is untrue as I can speak for the 1st team when\nI say we have thoroughly enjoyed the season and the good\nname of Imperial College Rugby\nClub has been sown over previously barren ground.\nFinally, I would just like to\nsay a word of thanks to all the\nplayers and officials of the club\nwho have backed me to the hilt\nin everything I 've done. All in\nall the club and I have had a successful year.\u2014THANKS.\nM. Turner,\nCaptain I.C. R.F.C.

    "content": "2 FELI X We Believe In Fairies!\nA sparse audience was present at the Debate on 11th March to\nconcur with Viscount Barrington's motion that \" this House believes\nin fairies.\"\nLord Barrington treated the motion scientifically, pointing out\nthe folly of disbelieving in the existence of fairies merely because\nthey were not obvious. He cited the peculiar clicking sounds in RCM\n\u2014due to metro-gnomes\u2014and the hp use was reminded of the mean\ngold-grasping gnomes of Zurich, responsible for so much recent dis-tress. In conclusion, he even persuaded the audience that recent\n\" leaks \" in the College telephone system were due entirely to fairies !\nIn opposition, Michael Scott appealed for commonsense. With\nlittle to offer in the way of argument, he made a number of jokes,\na few of which bore some re le SPACE\nvance to the motion.\nReuben T. Sawdaye, President\nof ULU Debates, supporting the\nmotion, related two fairy stories\nand sat down again. Mike Edwards' main contribution to the\nopposition was the deleterious\neffect lucky charms made in\nHong Kong were having on\nBritish Industry.\nThrown open to the floor r several jokes, thinly disguised as\nspeeches for and against the\nmotion, ensued. Summarising\nfor the opposition, Mike Scott\nhad little to add to his previous\nspeech, his main argument remaining one of commonsense.\nLord Barrington amplified his\nmain points in support of the\nmotion and concluded by reading a poem on a leaf\u2014by fairies,\nof course !\u2014found beneath the\nstatue of Peter Pan.\nG.B. FOCUS Mountaineering\nClub\nA college mountaineering club does not exist solely as a means\nto an end. If it did, the club would soon meet its down fall, but if\nthe members treat the term mountaineering as an excuse for the club\nto exist, then it can be a great success.\nThe I. C.M. C. is just such a club. All its meetings are social\noccasions, whether they take place in the Union Bar, at the Outdoor\nLife {Exhibition, in Snowdonia or in the Alps.\nMost members know everybody else, and this acquaintance\nis not the superficial one of so\nmany other college societies,\nwhere someone may be admired\nfor his speech-making or his\ngoal-scoring. When two people\nhave helped each other to the top\nof a stiff climb, experiencing the\nsame ordeals, only then can a real friendship begin.\nWhy do we climb mountains ?\nIt is in a search for beauty. The\nScientists and engineers: research workers in new fields of human\nknowledge: and practical men to direct huge engineering enter-p rises; the Civil Service needs them all. More, it can provide them\nall with work exactly suited to individual qualifications and talents.\nThe Government is today the largest employer of scientists and\nengineers in the country, and has staff working in almost every\nfield of pure and applied science and engineering. Plant pathology\nand naval architecture, thermodynamics and physiology, celestial\nmechanics and highway engineering: these are just a few diverse\nexamples.\nProspects in the Civil Service compare favourably with those\nexisting in industry: every able scientist or engineer should achieve\na salary of \u00a32,500 within a reasonable period; and an outstanding\nman or woman (they receive equal pay) will do so in the early thirties. The top posts, which carry salaries of up to \u00a38,000, are open to all.\nAt each level, there is full scope for the exercise of personal initiative\nand responsibility. Laboratory equipment and engineering facilities\nare of the highest order. Conditions of service are good and pensions\nare non-contributory. Recruitment to the Scientific and Engineering\nCivil Service is by interview\u2014there are no written examinations.\nThere are openings at various levels and for almost every type of\nscientific and engineering qualification. To obtain detailed in form a tion, send a postcard mentioning-age and qualifications, to:\nThe Secretary, CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION\n23 Savile Row, London, W. l In an hour which passed all too quickly Dr. Nicholson explained\nsome of the difficulties facing astronauts and told of methods used\nto cope with their unnatural environment. His talk to WeUssoc\nincluded an interesting film of Colonel Glenn's historic orbital flight\nshowing Glenn's reaction' throughout and his reaction to the news\nfrom base that he would have to use manual control. Having heard\nDr. Nicholson, one was inclined to sym pathis e with Glenn.\nOne of the major problems encountered in spacecraft is that of\nproviding a breathable atmosphere for the astronaut.\nThe partial pressure of oxygen must be less than 450 mm. of mer-c ury. Above this level oxygen to xi ty sets in. A gas must be mixed\nwith the oxygen to keep the alveoli in the lungs inflated after the\n. blood has absorbed the oxygen\nfrom the inhaled gas. Mixtures\nof helium and nitrogen with oxygen are commonly used, but the\ncomplexity of the problem is\nenormous, and new mixtures are\nconstantly under investigation.\nAnother grave problem is that\nof withstanding the acceleration\nand deceleration s involved. The\nfirst ill effects from acceleration\nare experienced at a value about\nfour times that due to gravity at\nthe earth's surface (four \" G\"). This results in a reduction of\nblood flow to the eyes and eventually unconsciousness. This is\nremedied by the simple expedient\nof laying the astronaut on his back. This reduces the height to which\nthe blood must be pumped\nand accelerations up to 6G can be\nsustained, without loss of con-s cio us ness. The film of Colonel Glenn during his orbital flight was interest-ing, showing as it did how much\ncould go wrong with a space flight\nand how far such a project depends on the human element. In\nspite of his extremely thorough\ntraining and preconditioning,\nGlenn was quite shocked when\nthe automatic controls failed to\nwork, to the extent of forgetting\nto lower his visor on re-entry.\nHad any p uric turing s of the craft\noccurred, this could have proved\nfataL D.S.V IRK. hills are beautiful in their purity,\ntheir freedom, and their sim-pli city.

The detailed results\nare not yet known but LC. appear to have virtually swept the\nboard.\nThe 1st team retained the University Championship (shot at 25,\n50 and 100 yards), and an I.C. team of 3 won the Sharpshooter\ncompetition (breaking 2 clay discs\nat 100 yards).\nIn individual competitions R.D. Kennett won the University\nChampionship, J. M. Edmond\nwon Div. 2, and members of I.C.< were 2nd and 3rd in Div. 3. I.P. Freeman won the Pistol Championship and D.H. Davies was\n2nd. V.

Edmond won Div. 2, LP.\nFreeman won the Pistol K.O., and\nI.C.\"A\" won the Team K.O.

The ball\nplaying inside-forwards of LC. did not come up to standard and\nas a consequence could not pierce\na tightly packed defence. Crisp\nand Smart seemed lethargic in\ncomparison with previous rounds\nand even Kemp was not his usual\nself.\nThe game was very even until\nhalf-time when the score was nil\neach. After the restart with I.C. playing up the slope Battersea at\nlast broke through the College\nrear guard. The I.C. defence\nhad to withstand tremendous pressure hereabouts and the fact that\nonly one goal was scored was a credit to them. Kemp equalise d for I.C. five minutes from the end\nwhen the Battersea goalkeeper\nfumbled with the ball and allowed\nthe centre-forward to score.\nThe game went into extra time\nand after a hotly disputed corner,\nthe Battersea centre-forward was\nallowed to head the ball home.\nFrom then on I.C. made. little\nheadway and with the forwards\nlooking unlikely to score Battersea ran out worthy winners.\nscored more points. Thus, with\nluck, a tally of over 800 points\nis possible.\nA few changes have been made\nin the team due to injuries and\nretirements, \"f former f fagin s,\" Williams and Stabler, and occasionally Richards are back in play\nagain.' Topliss, f flouting the accepted team etiquette by bringing\na woman to watch twice, learnt\nhis lesson well: \u2014on both occassions he Was injured and has now\nretired to be nursed by his f femme f fatale. Perhaps if more thought and\nconsideration had gone into the\ngame before the kick-off then the\nstory might have been different,\nbut as it was Battersea seemed to\nhave more method than a disappointing I.C. side.\nRowing\nI.C. Win\nU.L. Head\nBy D. Pollard\nWednesday, 12th March\nThe results of the Boat Club's winter training and technique\ncoaching became evident this\nafternoon when the 1st VIII beat\nTyrian B.C.( the U.L.2 nd VIII)\nin the U.L. Trial Head of the\nriver race. This was driven home\neven further by the 2rit iy HI who\nfinished 3rd on overall placing,\nonly 2 sees behind the Tyrian\ncrew. \u2022 I This is the first time* that an\nLC. crew has actually beaten the\nTyrian crew in this event, although the I.C. VHI has won the\nDixon Bowl for the fastest college\ncrew ever since the race was\nstarted.\nResults: \u2014\n1. I. C.1st19.512. Tyrian B.C.20.003. LC. 2nd20.026. LC. 4th203811. LC.5 th21.2617. LC. Old Lags 21.54\n20. I.C.6 th22.14 This followed a very successful\nouting on the Tuesday, when I. C.1st VIII paced the Oxford Univ.\ncrew for the last 1\u00a3 miles of their\ntrial course; and another good\nperformance was in the Reading\nHead of the river where the 1st Vfl l finished 14th. equal and tied\nfor the junior-senior pennant.\nBy Ian Collins\nA month ago LC lost a fives\nmatch against U.C./ U.C.H. by\n74 pts. to 73. On the strength of\nthis close and enjoyable game a return fixture was arranged. The\ntryst was set for \" shrove Thursday \" the 4th March.\nLate injury forced David McBain to withdraw, probably for\nthe rest of the season, and so I.C. played with only 3 men, which\nmeant more play and less rest for\nthose 3. Such stiffer conditions\ncan be an advantage as long as\nthe overloaded players are fit,\nsince it cuts down the period of\nwaiting between games, during\nwhich concentration and touch\ncan be lost.\nAs in the previous meeting, the\nI.C. composite strings found one\nU.C. string slightly stronger, the\nother slightly weaker than them-selves.\nAt no time during the evening\nwere the colleges more than 6\npoints apart, and at the start of\nthe last set, LC. led by 6 points,\nbut the lead just couldn't be main-tai ned. The final scores were a win for U.C./ U.C.H. by 74 pts.\nto 72 pts., 4 games each.\nAnother Defeat\nI.C. were comprehensively\nbeaten on Saturday 13th March at\nthe Bank of England's courts in\nRoebampton. The Bank strings\nhave just returned from a successful tour in the South West, and\nthey weren't at all extended in\ngiving I.C. their heaviest defeat to\ndate by 120 points to 42 and 8\ngames to nil.\nLawn Tennis\nBy E.C. Sones\nAt the beginning of next term\nImperial College Lawn Tennis\nClub starts operating in full force.\nAs the holders of the U.L. U. Cup,\nI.C. have a very high standard to\nmaintain, but with four out of last\nyear's1st VI still at college the\ntask should not be impossible.\nThroughout the summer term\nI.C. will be arranging matches for\n1st and 2nd teams, with free\ncoaching for all members and\nplenty of court space 'for the\ncasual players.\nAs an added incentive a tour\nto the South of France has been\norganised for the summer. Thus\nif you enjoy a game of tennis join\nthe I.C. tennis club to ensure\nplenty of games with people of\nyour own standard, plus free\ncoaching. Also the subscription\nis less than you would pay for\ni hrs. coaching at-any tennis club.\nOn Saturday 20th March the 1st VHI paced Cambridge on a trial\ncourse and the following Saturday\n(27th.) the six I.C. crews will be\ncompeting against over 300 others\nin the Tideway Head of the river\nrace.\n\n"

In all honesty, I could only tell him that\nthere was no guarantee, it depending solely on the integrity of the\nstudent selling them. This did not deter him from purchasing some\nhowever, although he did not know me.\nNevertheless, it is still a valid point. There is nothing to stop\na student from selling his tickets, throwing away the counter foils, and\nkeeping the money. It may be argued that the majority of students\nare honest, and I sincerely hope and believe that this is so. Since,\nhowever, many students stoop to taking copies of Felix without paying\nfor them, and quite happily cheat the Post Office telephone service, and\nLondon Transport, my faith in students' honesty is perhaps rather\nnaive.\nI appreciate that it must have been quite a job just to distribute\nbooks of tickets, and that to check up on the whereabouts of every\nbook distributed, prior to the draw, would strain the organizers' resources of manpower to the limit, and might even be impossible.\nDespite this, I feel strongly that the slapdash method of previous\nyears is hardly ethical, and hope that some sort of check will be made\nthis year. Since I am creating such a fuss about it, I will be pleased\nto help those checking the counter foils, but it is perhaps too late;\u2014\nperhaps no note was made of who got which twenty tickets?\nIncidentally, what has happened to the one ticket free, given to\neach student selling a whole book, that has been a feature of previous\nyears?\nYours faithfully,\nMELVYN OWEN, (3.E.E.) Dear'Sir,\nIn reply to Mr. Owen's letter in this edition of Felix, we would\nlike to make the following points in defence of the present, apparently\nlax, system of raffle ticket distribution and collection.\nThe organisers do make a note of all cash and counter foils and\nunsold tickets returned. Hence, knowing that each undergraduate\nreceives two books and each postgraduate one book, we do have a check on tickets returned. There seems to be no more efficient method\nof dealing with the problem and there is little point in recording individual ticket numbers\u2014a mammoth task where 90,000 raffle tickets,\nabout 4,000 students and academic staff (and perhaps a further 1,500\nhon-academic staff) are concerned. Numbers on raffle tickets are\nmerely to distinguish one from another in the draw.\nWe do, however, accept your point that much depends on the\nintegrity of the individual, but we trust that where someone is collecting money for a charity they will not packet that money. One cannot\ndistrust everyone all the time l As for the free ticket\u2014thai is illegal]\nYours faithfully\nNEIL SUNDERLAND\nCAROLE WADE\n(Raffle Organisers)\nCome and support us\nDear Sir,\nThe inevitable Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting of I.C. Union\nhas been called in an attempt to\nreverse the decision taken at the\nlast Union meeting to affiliate to\nN.U.S. Since the meeting is to\ntake place at the end of term,\nthere is a strong possibility that\nthe meeting might be in quo rate. This must not happen since\nthen the issue will hang fire until\nit can be properly debated at a quo rate meeting. As there are no\nGeneral Studies next term and\nconsequently no two-hour lunch\nbreak, this is unlikely until the\nstart of the next session; a delay\nwhich can only do harm to the\nUnion.\nTo ensure that we join N.U.S., the motion to d is affiliate must be\nsoundly defeated after full discus-sion. Only then will the decision\ncarry the full weight of opinion of\nthe College, rather than a single\npressure group.\nI therefore ask all who voted\ntor affiliation at the last meeting\nto come and vote again (and to\nbring that friend who meant to\ncome but didn't think it was worth\ngoing); thus reiterating this decision of the Union to at last affiliate to N.U.S. Yours faithfully,\nMIKE EDWARDS\nDear Sir,\nThere is a further point nobody\nhas yet mentioned against the misuse of letter racks for society notices and unaddressed circulars. I believe that many other post-graduates, especially those from\noverseas, have the same feeling\nas I in this .\nIn the few years I am planning\nto stay in this country, the only\npermanent address I can use while\nat this College is my departmental\naddress. This I have to use not\nonly in my private correspond en ces, but in official communications\nas well. Then any correspondence\nconnected with my research work\nis of course again through the\ndepartment. These letter racks\nare the places I collect my letters\nand they are already serving a rough estimate of 400 students.\n(All first year engineering students\nin addition to second, third year\nand P.G. mechanical engineering\n^students use \u2022 the same racks.)\nThis latter point may be due to a Bad arrangement of the depart-ment, but I sincerely hope the students themselves can he lt> keep\nthem in proper use. Can the\neager committee members of the\nsocieties consider this point when\nplanning their publicity?\nYours faithfully,\nJOHN CHEUNG\n(Mech. Eng. P.G.)

The\nobvious answer is that we are students and, as such, reputed to live\nfor the present only. But surely, we can behave us adults and get\nour sense of values right.\nA recent example of-pettiness is the David Reich\u2014Social Clubs\nCommittee battle (reported on front page). Not one member of the\nS. C.C. pointed out that the Debating Society is \"having its most successful \"year ever. Apart from Mr. Anand, no one had any valid\npoints on the matter. With a little bit of \" give and take\" on both\nsides the whole affair could have been settled long before this.\nTechnically it seems that M/. Anand and his executive are in\nthe right, but what good can come from passing a vote of censure\non someone who is, in most eyes, a successful President ? NONE.\nIt can only upset a lot of people and magnify things out of all per-spec ti ve, as happened last year over Felix.\nN. UJS.\nIn or out ? Once more a motion has been signed by more than\nthe required 130 Union Members and the motion \" that we dis-affiliate forthwith from N.U.S.\" will be debated at a Union Meeting\nto-morrow.\nIt is high time that this question was at least settled for more\nthan the one or two years has has become a custom of the past\ndecade. The last N.U.S. debate, on 18th February, produced no\nreally satisfactory answer. Neither side had had time to point out\ntheir respective arguments and neither side produced any good\nspeeches. Even the proposer lost his notes and had to use the identical version that was used at the N.U.S. debate in 1963 !\nThe opposition failed to do anything until after the motion on\n18th February. They then tried to give the impression that \"They\nwere robbed.\"\nAgain it seems ludicrous that a difference of one in the voting\ncan decide this issue; especially since a two-thirds majority will be\nneede j for the cost it ut ional change required if an N.U.S. representative is to sit on Council.\nANTI-APATHY\nWe are always hearing the word \" Apathy \" bandied around in\nthis Union. But are we apathetic ? Most clubs and societies are\nnourishing, increasing their membership every year. Nearly all undergraduate s.ud ents are members of one or more societies. Postgraduates could be called \"apathetic\" as not many join in Union Life.\nBut the majority of P.G. s have other interests outside of the Union\n(Marriage ?) and anyway have already put up with their fair share\nof the pettiness that pervades this Union.\nHALDANE LIBRARY\n13, Prince's Gardens\nSorry! You won't find textbooks or scientific treatises in\nthis library, but you will find o yer10,000 good books of general\ninterest including all the latest\nnovels!\nAnd it's Free too !\nOpen 11\u2014-S39 p.m. and\nuntil 7.0 p.m. on Tuesday\nand Thursday\nLAM LEY'S TECHNICAL & GENERAL\nBOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nDRAWING\nINSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY\nPAPERBACKS\n1, 3 & 5 EXHIBITION ROAD,\nLONDON, S.W.7 G0LGUTT\nGETTING INTO HALL\n\"Hall application forms must be handed in by May ls tl \"\u2014or\nso it says on those Bttte notices. Yon may be interested to know\nwhat happens between then and the day you receive a note of acceptance or refusal.\nWell, Miss Burns first sorts the forms out into different piles for\neach hall. When, as last year, some halls are very over- and others\nvery under-subscribed, the forms are reshuffled on an arbitrary basis\nuntil the application/places ratio is the same for each. By this time,\neach hall has appointed a selection committee\u2014^usually consisting of\none departing student from each constituent College. These people\nlook through the applications for their hall, and award each applicant marks for participation in College and Union activities, etc.,\nand whether or not they think he's a\" good chap \" and a potential\nasset to the hall. Places are then offered to people with the highest\nmarks, remembering that a certain number of places in each hall\nmust go to department ally chosen first year students, overseas\nstudents, people staying on for a second year in hall, warden's no mi nations, and so on.\nI must say that the arbitrary basis on which forms are farmed out\nto the halls' selection committees seems both unfair and unnecessary.\nUnfair because last year it led to one hall having to accept candidates\nit considered as undesirable\u2014and who were probably less deserving\nof a place than many \" rejects \" from other lists. In addition, at least\none other committee marked people down if their hall was down as\nthe applicant's second or third choice, although the application was\nnever ever seen by the first choice hall.\nUnnecessary, because the introduction of some form of central\nselection system for all halls would eliminate both above injustices\n\" First time \" candidates would put no choice of hall on their form,\nwhich would be nia rke d by a six to ten-man committee drawn from\nall halls, and preferably the union also. It would then be an easy\nmatter to fit the people with tops marks into available places\u2014maintaining also a large measure of personal preference for a particular\nhall. Candidates for a second year in hall would be selected as at\npresent.\nI have pu os ely not named any halls in the above, as this would\nprobably do more harm than good, and would certainly not increase\nanyone's chance of a fairer consideration of his application. This\nwill only come when the system is altered.\nR.C.S BID FOR NINES\nTake a quick glance at page 53 of the college calendar, and\nit is immediately revealed (wait f pr it )that Prof.. Sutton is head of\nthe Geology Dept.\u2014which is part of RCS (Bingo!). Surprising,\ntherefore, to see last week that he has also become Dean elect of the\nRoyal School of Mines. Of course, it has beep widely felt for some\ntime that the Geology department should be a part of Mines, and\nthe staff expressed support for this change some time ago. Underlying all this, however, is the fact that the constituent colleges are\nbecoming more and more super flo us to the I.C. of the sixties.\nCOMMENT\nLest you think NUS is the only thing in the world (God help us),\nconsider briefly your Union Council. Among others, it contains nine\nstudent representatives, who have to be divided equally between the\nthree colleges\u2014a ridiculous and unnecessary restriction for a start\nThere are also three reps from old student associations where one\nwould surely be enough.\nAnyway, on to the last gathering of this august body on March\n15th, out of 26 members, six attended less than half the meeting,\nand three were completely absent. Although several relatively important points were discussed, the number of people who actively participated and put forward constructive ideas could have been counted\non the fingers of one hand\u2014the rest r hight as well have been\nobservers. Moral ? I 'll leave that to you\u2014I 've done enough tub-thumping for one week.\n\n"

General Committee on\nTuesday, 16th March. The main\nra as on was the very poor response\nia tickets sales\u2014only 170, were\nsold as compared with the 230\nfor the Guilds-Mines Carnival\nlast term.\nDick Smith was doubtful\nwhether the Carnival had been\nworth all the effort that had been\nput into it. He also thought that\none carnival shared between the\nthree Constituent Colleges would\nbe adequate.\nJo Collins Chairman C.&G. Events holds the opposite opinion.\nHe cannot understand why R.C.S. lost for the Guilds-Mines Carnival\nbroke even. He did say, however,\nthat next year the Guilds-Mines\nCarnival might be completely different. Both Messrs Collins & Smith\nsuggest that many students may\nnot know what a Carnival is. A Carnival is an extended hop lasting through the early hours, with\na Cabaret, Buffet and Licenced\nbar until 2.00 a.m. It is also used\nto distort the \" reasonable hour \"\nrule for visitors to leave Hall.\u2014\nN.J.

The objects proved\nto be a set of tyres, scaffolding\npoles and dustbins.\nThe Race was judged to have\nbeen well won by Civil Engineers, who went hot-footed to a lecture, still clutching the victors'\nbottles of beer,\u2014and the crate.\nTHE FILM The first two parts are of a high standard. The final part is\nproving difficult to shoot, for in\norder to film slow-motion scenes,\nmany lumen s are required, and\nthese are not forthcoming.\nHowever, Mr. Molam will doubtless take the plunge before the\nend of the term\nR.C.S. CARNIVAL A good turn-out of fancy dress, from pirate and grass skirts to\nAmerican tourists, greeted the West Indian r eel band. Films were\nshown all night; some excellent new groups and the cabaret seem to\nhave met with approval. Well done, Dick Smith and the Ents. Committee, and well done, Adrian Fletcher and the cabaret cast! Those\ntwo cowboys did have the right tickets.\nR.C.S. DINNER\nSurprisingly enough this is the first time a dinner for the whole\nR.C.S. has been tried. It will be held on the first Friday of next term,\n30th April. This could well become the big event in the Union\nCalendar, with distinguished guests, if all goes well. The cost will\nbe XI, but it won't be collected till next term. Lists are up, so please\nsign them before the end of term.\nATHLETIC SPORTS\nThe inter-college sports are soon after the beginning of next term,\nWith our long cross-country season, distance running is usually\nstrong but the short track season just before the exams means that\nany sprinters or field events people would probably be welcome. So\ncontact Derek Wade, Botany Dept., if you were a reasonable school\nathlete, but haven't done any at college. I hear Needham is training for the tug-of-war by pulling his bed up and down the room.\nNEXT YEAR On a number of evenings at the end of February and beginning\nof March, dismayed Londoners saw a varied assortment of young\nmen driving a pedal car between the post office and South Kensington\nUnderground station by way of the tunnel. These young RCS men\nwere training for the 24-hour pedal car race which started on Friday,\n5th March, at Bristol. They succeeded in gaining 12th place overall,\nand 3rd in their class.\nThe car had been designed on the basis of last year's handicap\nformula, with 12-inch wheels. But, just before the start of the race,\nthe organisers decided against using this handicap system, and\n\" Jezette\" was placed into class II (11-\u201415-inch diameter wheels).\nBeing early arrivals at Bristol, As evening approached the car\nthe RCS team was able to choose (No. 16) settled into 12th place,\nthe best pit site, and then they\nhelped to clear the snow in front\nof the pits. But, in spite of their\nefforts, the track was still icy at\nthe start of the race at 12.38 when\nMr. Reginald Maudling, the\nConservative MP, dropped the\nstarting flag.\nEarly in the race, Jezette was\nlapping in 1 min, 33 sees., with\ndrivers changing every lap. A collision on the second lap\nloosened the car's right-hand\nfront-wheel bearing, but the\nwheel never collapsed though the\nbearing mounting was elliptical\nat the end of the race.\nagainst the formidable opposition\nof 20 m.p.h.18 inch wheelers,\ndragging to lap times of two\nminutes between 3 and 4 a.m. The bright Saturday dawn and\ngood breakfast raised the team's morale, so that by the time President Kish Sadhvani had arrived,\nwith his eleven buccaneers,\nstraight from the RCS Carnival,\nlap times had reached an all-time\nlow of 1 min. 20 sees. Added incentive came from car 15, only\nhalf-a lap ahead.\nOnly 44 cars out of the original\n54 crossed the finishing line at\n12.38 on Saturday.\nGENTLEMEN OF MINES\nWho's for president', C.S. EVANS.\nAn air of tension and excitement prevailed in the packed\nUnion meeting held on Tuesday,\n16th March. It was time once\nagain for the annual election of\nnext year's executive and officers.\nThe executive posts were hotly\ncontested, the calibre of all the\nnominees being high, as shown in\nthe speeches from the respective\nproposer s. The chosen executive\nelect is as follows:\u2014\nDick (Goalie) Gash\u2014President.\nDick (Mr. I. C.W. A.) Potts\u2014\nVice-President.\nMike (Ents.)

There were 30 abstentions.\nMr. Powell opened with charges against the Labour Government's five months of office. He did concede, however, that its personnel had an organising ability of the highest order\u2014but the country\nwas not ready for organised chaos and disorder.\nThe new administration had implemented even more \" stop-go \"\npolicies. And the talking-down of the British economy\u2014to the tune\nof $3 billion credit\u2014and the Con\ncord review had far from unproved our standing abroad.\n\" The Labour Government,\" he\nsaid, \" has succeeded in spreading alarm and despondency in\nBritish industry\" and \"discord\nand distrust not only in Europe\nbut throughout the world.\"\nIn reply Mrs, Babara Castle,\nthe Minister for Overseas Development, began with a long\ntirade on the character she was\nopposing. She noted that Mr.\nPowell had had no confidence in\nthe previous Government either,\nand further gave vent to his\nchequered ministerial career.\nThirteen years of Conservative\nrule had shown a remarkable\nlack of co-ordination. She stated\nthat when the Socialists came to\npower they were faced with the\nlargest-ever trade gap. Something had to be done rapidly, even\nif unpopular, \" To stop the gap\nand prevent the economy running\nmore and more into the red.\"\n(Laughter.)\nIn the long-term the Government was giving incentives to ex-porters, had set up a prices-and-incomes review board, and had\ngiven the British computer industry a big boost. Such, she in-s is ted, were expansionist policies,\nnot protectionist ones.\nDavid Reich, President of IC\nDebates, referred to the present\n\" Mock \" Government as \" One in\nwhich the left hand, or wing,\ndoesn't know what the right is\ndoing.\" While the left wing\nquibbled over Vietnam, the right\ndisagreed with the Government\non steel.\n\" Healthy discussion,\" cried\nMr. Needham from the floor.\n\" I 'll be dealing with the Ministry\nof Health later,\" Reich retorted,\nand described the abolition of\nprescription charges as the worst\nfeature of the Budget. (Hisses.)\n\" Point of information,\" begged\nthe Chairman of SCC. \" You wouldn't have any information\nfor me,\" Reich told Mr. Anand.\nDavid Watson, last year's ICU\nPresident, thought Tory Governments had been too complacent\u2014\n\" If foreigners don't want to buy\nour goods, then they can go else-where.\" An incomes policy, he\nstated, was just around the corner\n\u2014 Mi. Powell smiled knowingly.\nIn comparing the two major\nparty leaders, he described Sir\nAlec \" Like a dinosaur that this\nemerged into the hard light of the\n20th century.\"\nTory David Pinsent felt that\nthe Labour Party preferred the\npurity of Opposition to power.\nMany of their recent actions had\nbeen harmful due to haste.\nHilary Thompson considered\nman to be naturally perverse,\nand, of the Conservatives, \" This\nmalingering rag-bag is not fit for\ngovernment!\"\nThe Liberals were not forgot-ten. Edward Fortune forecasted\na Liberal gain at Roxburgh, the\nLabour candidate losing his deposit ! Under Labour, he added,\n\"London will come to a standstill\u2014.and nothing will stop it!\"\nIn summary Mrs. Castle reminded the house of the election\npledges already fulfilled\u2014-at a rate of over one a week.\nD. I.W.A full-scale attack on Mr. David Reich, President of Debates,\nwas launched by Mr. Uppinder Anand, Chairman of the Social Clubs\nCommittee, on Tuesday, 16th at the S. C.C. Meeting. Mr. Anand\nmoved that \" In view of the irresponsible behaviour of Mr. Reich\nit is proposed that the financial account of the Debating Society be\nfrozen. It is also recommended the committee of the Debating\nSociety reconsider the position of Mr. Reich as president.\"\nMr. Reich, Mr. Anand stated, was \" either not capable of being\nPresident of Debates or irresponsible\" and had \"generally let his\nSociety run into chaos.\"\nThe cause of the trouble was finance. The Debating\nSociety had failed to submit financial figures for the half-yearly\ncheck, had failed to collect money from students who had entertained\nvisiting guests to sherry and luncheon, when instructed to do so by\nthe S. C.C., and had overspent their publicity grant without approval\nfrom the S. C.C. Mr. Anand went on to enlarge on Mr. Reich's misdeeds. Mr.\nReich\u2014who was not present\u2014apparently refused to answer letters,\nfailed to arrive at meetings on time and generally did nothing to\nalleviate the financial troubles of his society.\nThe Debating Society account was overdrawn \u00a32 and some bills\nhad not been received. The only light Mr. Hilary Thompson, the\nDebating Society Treasurer, could throw on the affair was that Mr.\nReich lived away from College and only came to the Union two dav s a week.* Mr. Anand replied that letters sent in December should\nhave been answered by now.\nThe motion was about to be put to the vote when Mr. Reich\narrived with profuse apologies. The charges were repeated and he\nContinued on p.12 Barbara Castle speaking during the debate.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX3 TOUCHSTONE WEEKEND\nPOWER BLOCK DANGER\nThe ideal for which Commonwealth countries should aim should\nbe a free association of independent states with a high degree of\ntechnical co-operation. The formation of a Commonwealth \" Power\nblock\" could be highly dangerous and should be avoided.\nSuch were the views which emerged from the most recent 74th Touchstone Weekend, on 13th \u201414th March, at Silwood Park. The\nguest speaker was Mr. Patrick Keatley, Commonwealth Correspondent of the Guardian.\nIn his opening speech on \" Commonwealth Realities \" made particularly interesting by frequent anecdotes and personal reminiscences,\nMr. Keatley traced the historical\ndevelopment of independence\namong the nations of the Commonwealth, leading to the present\ntime with twenty member\nnations and seventy-four dependent countries.\nHe spoke of the immense differences in tradition and modes of\ngovernment within the Commonwealth and considered that\nthe problem of race relations with\nparticular reference to Rhodesia\nand South Africa was the most\ncrucial one facing us to-day. The\nmodel of the Commonwealth as a wheel, with the United Kingdom\nat the hub, was out of date and\na more accurate representation\nmight be that of a lattice.\nThe next Touchstone Weekend\nwill be on May 15th16 th, when\nProfessor Cherry will speak on\n\" Moral Attitudes in a Technical\nAge.\"\nPAUL ROGERS.\nNOTHING NEW\nWith the tragedies of Senna,\nAlabama, hitting the headlines\nthe meeting of ICSFRE on Monday evening was a decided anti-climax. An audience of 13 (in-clu ding Felix reporter) was\nthere to hear David Freestone,\nfrom Oxfam, speak on the Negro\nand segregation in the United\nStates, and how that problem\ncould be compared with the\nproblem of hunger and depression in the underdeveloped countries of the world. It was just as\nwell there were not more people\nat the meeting, what the speaker\nhad to say .was neither new nor\nprofound, and not even very\ninteresting.\nHe began by recounting his experiences on a visit to the United\nStates last summer, with the Clayton Volunteer Programme.\nThe speaker then went on to\ncompare the Negroes poverty and\noppression with that of the underdeveloped African and South\nAmerican countries. The solution to these problems he said lay\nin education. In the United states\nthe Negro schools had very poor\nteachers and as a consequence\nchildren would leave hardly being\nable to read and write. Because\nof this lack of education, these\npeople could not improve their\nlot. Therefore, it was, he said,\nthe duty of the rich nations of the\nworld to pour money into the\neducation of the less fortunate so\nthat they, in time, would be able\nto help themselves.\nMAY BALL 1965\nNow, only seven years after the first May Ball was held, this\nformal dance with the informal atmosphere is fast becoming traditional. Little wonder either, for this Ball, which starts Carnival\nWeek events rolling, is a night's merrymaking unsurpassed in the\nI.C. Social Calendar.\nSimply fill in the application form enclosed in this week's Felix\nand return it (together with the very moderate sum required) to the\nHon. Sec., I.C.U. Entertainments Committee, c/o the Union Office.\nThe ticket will entitle you to spend the night of Friday, May\n7th, from 9.30 p.m. until dawn dancing to any of six bands (a cast\nheaded by the Mike Cotton\nSound, the Paul London Orchestra and the New Sedalia Jazz\nBand).\nAny time between 10.30 and\n1.30 a.m., you may indulge in a* sit-down buffet and the Gorgeous\nGoldway Girls will be giving their\nfabulous Limelight floor show at\n1 a.m. Other treats include seeing the Carnival Queen crowned,\nand merely drinking in any of the\nthree bars.\nTo be sure of your ticket fill in\nthe form and return it now !\nSTUDENT OFFICERS\nUNEXCITING\nA pen-pushing and paper job, is\nhow Roger Hobbs, the Chairman\nof R.C. C., describes his job.\nHis main function is to look\nafter the organization and finances of the Recreational Clubs. He\nis also their representative on\nCouncil.\nThere are many summer tours\nbeing arranged and it is also his\njob to keep tabs on their organ iz a tion. He sits on several sub-com-mitte es including Student Finance\nand Felix and Phoenix Boards\n(\"though God only knows why! \",\nto quote).\nMr. Hobbs does not mind-ad-,\nmit ting that his is a far from exciting job since, to quote, \"1 do\nnot want to be President next\nyear.\"\n(Continued\nfrom p.2) south. In this situation not only\nwas there racial division, but also,\nbitter party division, both black\nand white.\nProfessor Kirkwood compared\nthe situation with that in Britain\nin the early years of the Labour\nparty. He stressed the need for\nAfrican education and suggested\nthat even minority representation\nby the more able African politicians would be better to the present situation, where the African\nNationalists refuse any compromise measures.\nLIBERAL SEMINAR\nNew Look Government\nAt a Liberal Club seminar held at Oxford on 20\u201421 February,\nthe view was put that many powers and functions of central and\nlocal government should be given to directly-elected regional assemblies, of which there would be about 12 in the country.\nThese regional assemblies would be financed partly locally by\nsite value taxation and partly nationally by a block grant from the\ncentral government. Local government would be reformed to ensure\nthat local problems would be dealt with locally, and that regional\naffairs, now dealt with by a conglomeration of authorities, would be\nconsidered regionally ; the abolition of county councils was suggested.\nImperial College was represented at the conference by Edward Fortune, President of U.L. Liberal Federation, and Peter\nTowlson, two of four members\nfrom London.\nThe conference felt that local\nbroadcasting could play 9. big\npart in developing these regions.\nAnd, in order that national economic and industrial planning\nshould be effective, a degree of\ndirection of industry and population was suggested.\nRhodesia\nThis Man is going\nto East Germany for\nhis next vacation\nWhy? well, for a start, because lie's never been there\u2014\nnor have any of his friends.

Council sent Mr. Moore and Mr. Price\nhot foot to the planning Office.\nN.U.S. was mentioned only\nbriefly, Council approved the\nexecutive recommendation that,\nfor this year only, we will send\nfive delegates to the Easter Council, two of whom shall be executive committee members.

In England, Science and Engineering are only taught properly\ntor the first year or two at school; after this the very method of\nteaching contradicts what is first taught The first steps taken into\nthe maze of scientific learning are devised so that the young student\ncan cultivate the \"scientific method.\" Experiments are usually\ndevised by the class making suggestions to the teacher. In this way\nthe class learns to think for itself, and the experiments show something that the child has not seen before\u2014notice the number of\nelementary books with titles \" Finding Out\" or \" Discovery.\"\nHowever, this early phase is soon over, and the student has to\nget down to \" the serious work of learning.\" Exams press hard and\nthe spirit of enquiry is soon squashed under a heavy blanket of endless facts.

To the fifth former making the dec i sion, the study of the Arts offers\nscope for initiative, the study of\nscience does not. In studying\nliterature and history, one is put\ninto the position of a researcher\nwith a host of different sources to\nconsult and opinions to be\nformed. Although these are very\nlikely to be unsound, they are\nstill acceptable and not \" wrong.\"\nThe science student, however, is\nfaced only with the prospect of\nendless classes, and problems to\nbe done. He is told continually\n\" this is right,\" \" you are wrong,\"\n\" this is what you must learn.\"\nIt is small wonder that too few\nopt for science in the sixth form.\nNo Better\nAt University\nAt university it is no better; if\nanything it is worse.\nAlmost no scope is given for\ninitiative. One's time is taken up\nwith interminable lectures in\nwhich one is fed facts, and deluged with problem sheets. The\nsole aim appears to turn one into\na reference catalogue from which\nfacts can be drawn at will. In the\nlaboratories a mockery is made\nof the word \" experiment.\" In\nthe second year light current\nlaboratory course in Electrical\nEngineering there is only one experiment that is true experiment\nwhere any intelligence is re-qui red; all the others merely require one to follow an instruction sheet almost word for word.\nHow Can It\nBe Changed?\nCan this be changed at all ?\nIs it possible to alter the course\nso that it can be made more interesting and constructive? I think it can be, and the suggestions that follow are based on two\nobservations : one, no use will be\nmade after leaving college of the\nmajority of the facts that are at\npresent memorised; two, it is of\ngreat importance to know how to\ngo easily about learning those\nfacts which it does become necessary to know afterwards. I think\nthat a scheme of the sort outlined\nbelow would go part of the way\ntowards filling this latter need.\nWhat About\nProjects?\nThe present scheme of lectures\nfollowed by exam could be replaced by a system of \" projects.\"\nAt the beginning of the year one\nwould be given several projects\nwhich would involve the study of\nthe different branches of the\nsubject. This would have to be\nbacked up by experimental work\ndone in a laboratory which would\nbe made available at specified\ntimes. It should be possible to\nsee tutors frequently, so that help\nand guidance could be sought\nand given, and at the end of the\nyear a full report would be pre-,\npared showing the ground\ncovered, hot unlike a text book.\nFor example if one of the subjects was \"transistor amplifiers\"\nthis would require the study of\nthe basis of the transistor and the\nnature of semi-conductors, and\nthe maths that this would entail.\nExperiments would have to have\nbeen devised and different amplifiers built and composed.\nIf such a scheme were adopted\nit would mean throwing over a lot of cherished beliefs and ideas\nbut I feel that in the end the engineers produced would be educated m the proper sense of the\nword although they might\n\"know\" fewer facts. Perhaps it\nis not too much to hope that it\nmight attract a few more into the\nvital fields of Science and Technology.\nCOLLEGE PROGRESS\nThe Rector's March Bulletin (obtainable from I.C. books tall, price 6d.) contains much interesting information on the progress the\nCollege is making in various fields. Some-, of its contents have\nappeared in other forms in past issues of Felix, but much of it covers\nfields about which a lot Of students would otherwise be unaware. Staff\nchanges and Honours figure prominently. The following is a brief\ndigest of a few selected topics.\nTHE 1970 COMMITTEE\nThe Report of the 1970 Committee, which contains no less\nthan 61 recommendations, is now complete. The Committee, chaired\nby Professor Ford, has since May 1962 been considering four fields :\n1. Academic policy for undergraduates, including types of degrees,\nlength and content of courses ;\n2. Postgraduate courses;\n3. Teaching methods.\n4. The arrangement of terms and College hours.\nThe first three of these were referred to the departments concerned for their opinions, and the fourth to the Registrar. The Board\nof Studies has been discussing the Report since November, and will\neventually decide which recommendations to implement.\nCOLLEGE HISTORY\nDEVELOPING\nA move was made early in\n1558, to produce a full-length and\ndefinitive history of the Imperial\nCollege of Science and Technology. The first task was to complete the departmental histories;\nseveral of these are now com-ple te, or almost so, and substantial work has been done in the\nremainder.\nThe Archives, in 180 Queen's Gate, contain much well-do eu men ted material connected with,\nthe college's history. All those\ninterested are welcome to investigate. BOOMING COMPUTER UNIT\nThe College Computer Units'\nmajor piece of equipment, the\nIBM 7090 started doing useful\nyork On 11th January. The auxiliary IBM1401 computer arrived in February, and the complete installation should soon be\ncoping adequately with the heavy\nworkload expected.\nDelivery of the high-speed data\nlink to the University Atlas Computer has, unfortunately, been\ndelayed; it is* now expected to\narrive in April.\nThe Rt Hon. Earl of Halsbury will inaugurate the Unit on\nWednesday, 12th May.\n$1,000 TO LYON PLAYFAIR\nOn the initiative of the United\nStates Embassy, the American\nBusiness Committee to Advance\nEducation has selected the Library as the first centre in Britain\nto receive major gifts of scientific\ntextbooks and monographs.\nBooks to the value of $1,000 have\nso far been purchased by this\nmeans and the Library has been\nasked to advise on the extension\nof the scheme to other universi-ties.\nTHE HALDANE LIBRARY\nResponsibility for the gramophone record collection has now\npassed from the Musical Society\nto the Haldane Library Committee. The Union has agreed to\ngrant the Musical Society an annual sum of money for the purchase of new records, and a number of musical scores have been\nrecently made available.\nOther additions to the Haldane\nLibrary include texts and grammars for those interested in\nmodern European languages, in\nparticular, Russian, and a number of novels in French and\nGerman.\nMr. Enoch Powell speaking at the debate\n(see front page)\n\n"
