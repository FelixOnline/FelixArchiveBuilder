    "content": "While the rest of the world has\nbeen justifiably preoccupied\nwith the burning of fossil fuels and its\neffect on the climate, conservationists\nhave been trying to find innovative ways\nto prevent further warming of the earth\nand preserve earth\u2019s biodiversity.\nThe news that woolly mammoths\ncould soon be roaming among us has\ngripped the attention of media sources\nand their readers alike for the past week.\nColossal, a private biotech firm, has announced the launch of a radical de-ex-tinction project with a bold mission:\nto bring back woolly mammoths by\ncreating an elephant-mam-moth hybrid, and more\nimportantly, use this\nhybrid to help fight climate change and\nimprove biodiversity. Having already\nraised $15 million in initial funding,\nthe start-up is confident that it will\nachieve its aims.\nBut how could bringing back an\nanimal that became extinct 10,000 years\nago work to halt the warming climate?\nTo answer this, we must first understand one of the potentially biggest\nclimate change contributors that is rarely discussed \u2013 permafrost. Permafrost\nis simply defined as ground that has\nbeen at the temperature of 0oc or lower\nfor two consecutive years. This frozen\nland makes up an expansive 24% of the\nNorthern Hemisphere, covering vast\nstretches of Siberia and Alaska.\nHowever, as you might expect in a\nwarming climate, this ground is not\nstaying frozen. In the last few decades,\npermafrost has begun to thaw, at the\nsame time releasing just some of the\n1,600 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide\nstored within it, as well as the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide.\nThat is double the CO2 levels currently\nin the atmosphere. This process occurs\nwhen the ground temperature rises\nabove freezing, allowing microorganisms to break down organic matter\nin the soil, and in the process releasing greenhouse gases. It is estimated\nthat by the end of the century,\n40% of the earth\u2019s permafrost\nland will have thawed.\nThe idea of using large animals to protect permafrost is\nnot new; in fact, it has already\nbeen attempted by a Russian\nfather-and-son team, who Colossal is in collaboration with.\nSince 1996, Sergei and Nikita\nZimov have been working on\nthe Siberian \u2018Pleistoscene Park\u2019\nwhere they have been bringing animals, including bison,\nhorses, reindeer, goats, and\nother herbivores, to\nrepopulate the land. 14,500 years ago,\nthese animals used to sustain the permafrost layer as they could tramp down\ndeep snow, allowing heat to escape from\nthe ground and locking in the cold.\nTheir presence also helped grasslands\nthrive, which takes water out of the soil\nand into the atmosphere, cooling the\nground at the same time. When these\nanimals disappeared from the region\nand moved down to Europe and Asia,\nthey left the permafrost unprotected\nand vulnerable to a warming climate.\nAccording to the Zimovs, the results\nof this project have been promising; the\nanimals have adapted well to their new\nbiome, and the scientists are noting a\ncooler ground temperature where the\nanimals roam compared to the surrounding areas.\nMeanwhile, Colossal has begun what\nthe two Russian scientists have only\ndreamt about up until now \u2013 repopula-tion of the Siberian plains with woolly\nmammoths. Although, these animals\nwon\u2019t really be woolly mammoths.\nColossal describes its project as \u2018Woolly\nMammoth De-extinction\u2019, but the technique that the company has developed\nis based on the use of Asian elephants.\nThe team, led by Harvard\u2019s geneticist\nGeorge Church since 2017, is planning\non using CRISPR to edit the genome of\nthe endangered Asian elephant, native\nto the temperate climate of South and\nSoutheast Asia. To help the animal\nsurvive in the harsh temperatures of\nSiberia, the scientists will edit the parts\nof the elephant\u2019s genome responsible\nfor cold resistance, such as fat insulation and hair, to replace them with\nmammoth genes. According to Church,\nColossal\u2019s goal is \u2018to make a cold-resist-ant elephant\u2019.\nThe benefit of using a mammoth-ele-phant hybrid, according to Colossal and\nthe Zimovs, is that apart from tramping\ndown snow, these animals should also\nknock down trees, recreating a steppe\necosystem that used to exist 10,000\nyears ago.

Felix reports\non anything and\neverything Collegerelated, and supports\nthe different sections\non all topics with\nan equal amount of\nvigour. Climate change\nis just very important,\nand an issue we as a paper feel\nvery strongly about. Also, in light\nof the state of the planet, I believe\nit\u2019s only right to look at our beloved\nworld-leading institution\u2019s impact.\nSpoiler, it\u2019s not looking good.\nThe group People and Planet is a\nstudent network which has ranked\nall UK higher education institutions\non sustainability across a number\nof criteria, and given each a grade,\nfrom First, 2:1 etc to Fail. Imperial\nCollege snatches an easy Fail on\nthis list, ranking 130th out of 154\ninstitutions. Going into the metrics\nused to award this grade highlights\nparticularly where the College\nfalls short. Policy, Investment,\nEngagement and Water Reduction\nall clock in at 0%. Policy?! A zero?!\nNonsense! The College\u2019s website\noutlines its robust policies that will\nhelp it achieve its sustainability goals,\nincluding mandates such as \u201censure\nthat all teaching... is carried out in\na sustainable way\u201d. Alas, the days of\npouring oil onto endangered animals\nduring lectures are over. This page\nalso mentions that \u201cstudents are\nequipped with sustainability\nskills and knowledge for\nthe future\u201d. You know?\nThose mandatory\nSustainability Skills\nclasses the College\nmakes sure everyone\ngoes through during\ntheir time here? The\nones where they have a\ncrack at explaining whatever\n\u201csustainability skills\u201d means and then\ninstiltheminus?Thevaguenessmakes\nElizabeth Holmes look like a pedant.\nOn a more serious note, the\nCollege does provide a vast array of\ncourses relating to sustainability,\nand has a flagship Environmental\nPolicy department whose expertise\ninfluence the UK government and the\nwider world. Despite this, they don\u2019t\nemploy a single person full-time to\noversee the College\u2019s sustainability\nstrategy. In 2020 the Sustainability\nStrategyAdvisoryGroupwasformed,\nadding another leaf to the complex\ntree of boards and committees that\ndrive the College forward. It is no\nmember of the Group\u2019s primary\njobs to oversee sustainability. Some\npeople, including Union Deputy\nPresidents, see this juxtaposition\nbetween courses offered and\ninstitutional behaviour as wildly\nhypocritical. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\nCollege and the Climate\nThe Felix Editor on\nFRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER 2021\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement of\nIntent\nWe here at Felix believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to know.\nTransparency in the workings of the\nCollege and the work of your student\nrepresentatives is key.

The\nZimovs have been able to populate the\nSiberian tundra with only around 200\nanimals so far \u2013 a number that is too\nlow to have a profound effect on carbon\nemissions.\nAccording to Colossal, it will first\ntake about five years before a hybrid\ncalf would be born, and then another\nfourteen until it is able to reproduce.\nIf this happens to be a success, the\ncompany will need to breed enough\nelephant-mammoths to repopulate 3\nmillion km2 of Russian land in order\nto prevent a significant amount of\ngreenhouse gases from being released.\nTo many conservationists and climate\nscientists, this feat seems improbable, if\nnot impossible.\nThere are other hurdles Colossal has\nyet to face; the first one is getting the\nRussian government to agree to the use\nof a vast amount of land by an American business. Then, according to conser-vationists, bringing back a population\nof animals that has been extinct for\nthousands of years is risky, as we cannot\nunderstand how they will be able to\nadapt and fit into the biome.\nFinally, many scientists have voiced\nthe opinion that vast amounts of money\nand resources are being misdirected.\nInstead of spending millions on an idea\nthat has a low probability of being suc-cessful, they claim that it would instead\nbe more useful to direct that money to\nde-extinction project that we already\nknow will work.\nFor example, conservationists have\nrecently joined efforts to work on a\nprogramme that will breed coral reefs to\nmake them more heat resistant. Coral\nreefs - the ecosystem with the highest\nbiodiversity on earth - directly supports the livelihood of over 500 million\npeople worldwide. It is paramount that\nwe protect them now, as according to\nUNESCO, coral reefs in all reef-con-taining World Heritage sites could cease\nto exist by the end of the century. This is\nwhy, to many climate scientists and\nconservationists, a project that\nwill only begin to work in 20 years\ndoes not seem like a wise target for\n15 million dollars of funding.\nIf we are to avoid the most severe outcomes of climate change,\nwe must limit global average rise\nin temperature to 2oC. This would\nrequire global greenhouse gas emissions\nto be cut by 60% by 2050. To truly\nmake a difference to the rate of global\nwarming, we simply need to focus on\nthe obvious solution \u2013 moving our\neconomy away from fossil fuels and\ntowards renewable energy sources. We\nsimply can\u2019t afford to wait and see if a\nmiracle mammoth project is going to\nsave the planet; we must do it ourselves,\nand we must do it now.\nA team of scientists lead by George Church from Harvard Univeristy hope to genetically resurrect the woolly mammoth.\nPhoto credits: Harvard University\nPhoto credits: Pxfuel\n\n"

The quintessential\nDada Head and the photograph (inset)\ndestined forever to hang on the walls of\ntrendy coffee houses and the homes of wannabe art\nconnoisseurs studying at the Royal College of Art. Sophie Taeuber-Arp \u2013 the face behind the head and one\nof the leading figures of the early 20th century Dada\nmovement - is perhaps lesser known. Pictured here,\nTaebuer-Arp is both figuratively hidden behind the\nDada head and literally obscured by history\u2019s preference for familiar tastes and (male) artists.\nBorn in Davos, Switzerland in 1889, Taeuber-Arp\ndabbled in everything from dance, sculpture, tex-tiles, painting, jewellery, architecture, and furniture.\nTrained initially in textiles, workshops and later in\nmodern dance, Taeuber-Arp revelled in the unconventional from the very beginning. The Dada Head, one of\nher early and most famous work speaks to this \u2013 resembling a lathe-turned-hat-stand \u2013 it remains an almost\ncomical abstraction of a human portrait captured unequivocally in the plane of an industrial tool. In time\nshe established herself as a leading modern artist of the\nearly 20th century. And as the first world war drew to a\nclose,Taeuber-Arp\u2019snon-conformismfoundalignment\nwith the Dadaist, a collection of artists who revelled in\nthe radical and the abstract, part of a movement that\nemerged as a rebellion against all that lead to the horrors of the world war.\nThe comprehensive exhibition lays bare her repertoire with a carefully curated series of exhibits that\ndemonstrate her versatility not just with medium\nbut also with evolving styles. The exhibition captures\neverything; from her work in textiles to her experimentation with house furniture; from three-dimensional\nreliefs that look like futuristic jigsaw pieces to her lathe\nturned Dada heads; from her modern dance escapades\nto mini-puppets and set-design work for plays.\nAlmost poetically the exhibition is bookended by\ncontrasting styles: beginning with her experimenta-tions with grids and rectangular spaces; to the closing\nsection of the exhibition which focuses on her exploration of geometrical abstraction \u2014 filled with sharp\nlines and patterns, evoking some sort of unbridled\nspirit in each stroke that is almost in abject contrast\nto the rigidity of the earlier grid work! These lines and\ncurves weave and interweave almost like her work on\npatterns in textiles, creating and leaving behind patches\nof entrapped bright shades before ending abruptly at\nan apex. The result in both types of work is an intricate\nmosaic of colours and shapes that continues to push\nthe boundaries of abstraction in art.\nIn between these two sections, we see sprouts of her\ngenius in other avenues, from the architectural design\nof her house to designs for textiles and necklaces.\nPerhaps no other work captures the ingenuity of\nthe artist as her marvellous work on marionettes from\n1918. Commissioned to produce the set design and\npuppets for the play \u201cK\u00f6nig Hirsch\u201d (The King Stag)\nby Carlo Gozzi, Taeuber-Arp masterfully applied clean\ngeometrical shapes, bright colours, and considerate use\nof sharp edges to render her version of playful three-di-mensional Cubism.\nWhile these are certainly highlights, the exhibition\nputs it best foot forward in contextualising and appreciating the work within. There is an ever-present danger in curating an exhibition featuring (pretty much)\nthe entire repertoire of an abstract artist. Sketches and\nthematicworkscanshineaspotlightontheartisticpro-cess unlike any single piece of work ever can. These can\nbe used masterfully to cast an incisive perspective into\nthe evolution of an artist\u2019s work; or it can come across\nas nothing more than a collection of exhibits with no\nstory \u2014 thrown together and tied loosely, if at all, by\nonly the association in name. Whilst the exhibition\ndoes certain sections well (particularly those covering\nher textile work), it is undeniable that whilst covering\nsome themes, this exhibition at the Tate Modern veers\ninto the disorganised and self-indulged. Perhaps it\u2019s a\nlittle unkind to the modern art exhibition (particularly\noneofthisscale)toexpectmorethanwhatsomeexhib-its have to offer themselves. After all, what can one do\nwhen most sketches are labelled perfunctorily as \u201cGrid\nPatterns\u201d and \u201cVertical-Horizontal Composition\u201d?\nThat being said, in an exhibition brimming with novelty and story, to labour this point would be to miss the\nforest for these (very) few trees.\nSophie Taeuber-Arp died, somewhat trivially, having evaded the Nazis and death during the war, due to\nan accidental case of carbon monoxide poisoning in\nSwitzerland in 1943. Versatile and path-breaking, it is\nindeed a mystery how her work has evaded mainstream\nexhibition in the UK until now. This latest co-ordinat-ed travelling exhibition (organised by the Kunst Museum Basel, Tate Modern and the Museum of Modern\nArt, New York) has finally brought the artist\u2019s work to\nthe UK.

Overall, Lowland\nKids is a poignant documentary about two teenagers\ndesperate to remain in their home and the memories\nassociated with a certain place where they cannot\nstay for any longer. It is undeniable that the natural\nsplendour of the island captured using only available\nlight along with the intimacy of the stories told by\nthe teens is what makes \u201cLowland Kids\u201d an intimate\nand moving short film that successfully puts human\nfaces to the result of climate change.Lowland kids\nhad its world premiere in 2019 and went on to win\nseveral awards, you can stream for free on Vimeo. It\nis definitely worth the watch if you are looking for\na climate change documentary about the human\ncondition, rather than from a scientific point of view.\nLowland Kids\nFilm Recommendations\n2040 WALL-E\nAfter the grand success of his 2014 documentary\n\u2018That Sugar Film\u2019, Damon Gameau decided to\ninvestigate what the future could look like in 2040\nif practical solutions to environmental concerns\nwere addressed. As he stated himself, the film 2040\nis a letter to his daughter showing proven ways the\nenvironment could be taken care of better. With\nthe aim to educate viewers about new approaches\nto climate change, the film features innovative\nexperts in many fields to draw on their expertise.\nThis hopeful documentary focuses on five solutions,\neachcoveringadifferentindustryandhowitimpactsthe\nenvironment: electricity, transportation, agriculture,\nwater and resources in general. What makes 2040 an\noutstanding educational feature is the fact that for each\nenvironmental problem that already exists, Gameau\noutlines an existing solution that needs to be amplified,\nrather than lecturing the viewer into theoretical\nsolutions that have not yet been put into effect.\nOne of the proposed solutions to reduce the\ngreenhouse effect mentioned during the feature is the\nreal-world innovation of turning seaweed into salad.\nAs seaweed is the fastest-growing tree on the planet,\nif it was grown for food it would absorb thousands\nof tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nAccording to Gameau, the aim of 2040 is not to\nshow what we cannot fight against, such as intensified\nweather, but rather what we can fight for with passion\nand determination to make the world a better place\nfor the future, leaving an end with a hopeful message.\nYou can stream 2040 by buying it on Apple\niTunes, Google Play Movies, or downloading on\nYouTube. Additionally, you can create your own\npersonalised action plan for 2040 on the website.\nWALL-E is a 2008 animated film that is both a\nsource of entertainment for children as well as\na description of the worst consequences consumer and\nmaterialistic culture in our society can cause in the long\nrun. The film focuses on WALL-E, one of the last trash\ncompactor robots left on planet Earth, who falls in love\nwith another robot, Eve, and their adventures together\non a planet where there is no sign of life left. Despite\nthere being hardly any dialogue, the animations\nundoubtedly capture each character\u2019s development\nas well as the surface message: the need to discover a\npartner with whom to share life with. Although it\nmight be initially labelled as a child film, WALL-E\nis a dystopian science-fiction film portraying a dying\nplanet which is not so far away from our current reality.\nIt would be unfair to not mention one of the key\nelements of this movie, the music. It becomes such a\nsymbol to the story that the viewer gets captured in the\nmost memorable moments such as when WALL-E sees\nthe galaxy for the first time, giving its protagonist an\nemotionallifewhichattimesmakesusforgetitisarobot.\nIn conclusion, WALL-E does a great job of showing\nus how dark and dull our planet can end up if we\ndon\u2019t take any action. There is something very special\nabout the way Stanton (film director) puts together\na film that combines both a heart-warming romance\nbetween robots and at the same time leaves the viewer\nwith a sense of loneliness as the human characters\nseem to have no humanity. If you are up for a magical\nexperience, WALL-E is now streaming on Disney+.\nA look at climate change films\nEva Borras Film Editor\nDirectedby: Sandra Winther\nStarring: Juliette Brunet, Howard Brunet, Chris\nBrunet\nDirectedby: Damon Gameau\nStarring: Damon Gameau, Eva Lazzaro, Zo\u00eb\nGameau, Davini Malcolm\nDirectedby: Andrew Stanton\nStarring: Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin,\nFred Willard\n\n"

Wells founded the Science Schools Journal and after a number of iterations, Felix assumed its\nfinal form in 1949. As a voice for students, Felix strives to hold the College and Union to account through\ninvestigation by our News team, as well as offering a platform to read and write about almost anything that\ninterests them. We are a constitutionally unusual student newspaper, where we do not fall directly under the\nUnion\u2019s umbrella and therefore do not have to act as its mouthpiece. This puts us in a unique position to hold\nall aspects of leadership to account, and more importantly means we can tell the President he\u2019s a nerd and not\nbe censured (sorry Lloyd).\nThe next bit is so important, I\u2019ve even made the text a bit bigger:\nANYONE CAN WRITE FOR FELIX!\nIn the first issue, 09 December 1949, the words \u201csuccess or failure of this paper depends principally upon you\u201d\nappeared on the first page. This statement could not be more true today. Felix relies entirely on enthusiastic,\nintelligent and analytical students to produce the articles that so many love to read. I also have it on good\nauthority that most of the College\u2019s senior management read Felix, so if you want to send a message, there\u2019s\nno better way than an aggressive Comment article. If you\u2019re interested, please email the Editor, Sam, at felix@\nic.ac.uk.\nKeep the Cat Free\nThe Felix motto has been in place since 1974 and remains a core tenet of the paper\u2019s operation. Adopted\ninitially after the removal of the cost to buy the paper, it covers financial and philosophical aspects of the\norganisation. We will never use financial incentives as a way of progressing our content. We will always\nconsider an article for publishing as long as it is neither illegal nor immoral. A full look at the motto can be\nfound on page 2. However, if you take one thing away from this section, let it be this: we want YOU to write\nfor Felix.\n2\n0\n\n"

This will form\na team that will research further these\nsorts of decisions, both within the\nUnion and as material\nthat can be used to\nlobby the College to\nimprove. As a STEM\ninstitution we need to\nmake these decisions\non a data-driven basis.\nCurrently people such\nas myself, who are not\nexperts on these issues,\nare the main drivers of\nthese policy changes.\nIn the future we want\nto make more use of\nour expert volunteers\nto make more\ntargeted decisions.\nQ. On a scale\nof pragmatism to idealism, one\nmight assume that people such as the\nEnvironmental Society President would\nbe more idealistic than most, and is\nalso unlikely to have much industry\nexperience. I don\u2019t know whether this\nis the case, and the EnvSoc President\nmight be an extremely pragmatic person,\nhowever I would be very surprised if the\ngeneral state of people\nin similar positions\nwasn\u2019t this way. Do you\nthink inclusion of only\nthesepeoplemightsway\nthe Union\u2019s lobbying so\nfar in one direction that\nthe requests become\nunreasonable and the\nCollege stops listening?\nA. The place the SSB\nsits on that scale\nchanges year on year.\nTheconversationoccurs\nbetween the SSB and\nthe College, mediated\nby the Officer Trustees.\nIt is the job of the OTs\nto bring pragmatism to the requests of\nthe SSB and frame them in a way most\nlikely to get the College to listen. People\nelected into the environment-related\nroles will never usually have direct\ncontact with the College in regards to\nenvironmental lobbying. I also think\nthat the current state of affairs demands\nmore idealism. Imperial College is very\nfar behind in the industry and currently\nhas no full-time member of staff\nresponsible for sustainability, although\nthey are recruiting. The head of the\nSustainability Advisory Board is also a\nChemistry lecturer. The College needs\nto take this a lot more seriously. We are\ntrailblazinginsomeresearchareasrelated\nto sustainability and the fact we are so\nfar behind in our industry is not okay.\nQ. Would you say that the\nCollege\u2019s current position is\nhypocritical, given what you\u2019ve just\nsaid when comparing their courses\noffered to their internal actions?\nA. Truthfully, it comes across that\nway, and I don\u2019t think anyone could\nsee it differently. If you\u2019re producing\nthese people but not then utilising them\nthere\u2019s something wrong. A change in\nthe College utilising the people who\ncome out of these courses as experts\nwould be welcomed by all, I believe.\nQ. How can students get involved in\ntheSustainabilitysideoftheUnion?\nA. Involve yourself in the Union\u2019s\nEthics and Environmental network\n- they will be present at the Fresher\u2019s\nFair where you can join mailing lists.\nThe SSB can be a bit daunting to bring\na paper forward, however if you think\nthere\u2019s a real problem that needs solving\nwithin the Union or College, I would\nlove to have a conversation with you, and\nwe could end up producing a Council\npaper that causes real change. Joining\nthe Environmental Society, speaking\nto the Ethics and Environment officer,\njoining Veg Soc if you\u2019re that way\ninclined, and many other options offer\nways to expand your impact on helping\nclimate change.

These rewards will be\nakin to the experience of \u201cwhen\nyou give blood\u201d, and may come in\nthe form of tea, coffee and snacks\nhanded out directly to those receiving\ntheir jab. The College is working\nclosely with Imperial College Union\n(ICU) to provide these incentives.\nThe decision for these pop-up\nvaccination centres to go ahead comes\nas a result of deliberation within the\nCollege\u2019s Covid Operations Group\n(COG), headed by Director of\nAcademic Services, Richard Martin.\nFelix approached the College\nto ask about a Uni of Sussexstyle incentive scheme where 10\ndouble-jabbed students are chosen\nat random to win \u00a35000 cash,\nhowever the COG has opted for\nthe pop-up vaccine centres instead.\nWhen approached for comment,\nICU said the idea behind the small\nincentives was to \u201cencourage any\nstudents or staff, who may be\notherwise indifferent to having the\nvaccine, to get vaccinated\u201d. They also\nhighlighted that offering anything\nmore substantial as a reward would\nbe unfair on those who have already\nreceived both doses of the vaccine.\nBoth the College and the Union\nhighlighted the strong priority to\nget as many students jabbed as\npossible, and that they strongly\nencourage all students to do so.\nThisarticlewaspreviouslypublished\non the Felix website and may be seen\nas leading the reader to believe that the\nCollege is providing the vaccine popup tents. The tents are in fact being\nprovided by local council authorities.\nCredit: Envato Elements\nThe SSB is just a lobbying group, but it\u2019s the most powerful lobbying group students have to influence the College. Sam is chairing it this year and changes\nwithin the Union are happening constantly. Single-use plastics are essentially out the door and the Union is going the extra mile in most aspects to reduce\nlandfill and please students. Decisions surrounding sustainability are currently largely based on intuition but this will change in the future, and decisions will\nbecome increasingly data-driven. The College already has a fairly robust system of dealing with foodwaste in the form of a bioreactor that converts the energy\nfrom the waste into electricity, however this is a gem in quite a dull crown. Large plans for the future include cooperation with TooGoodToGo, which could\nallow students and staff to buy food close to its sell-by date at a reduced cost.\nTL;DR\n\n"

    "content": "On the 19th of May, the Science\nMuseum opened the Our Future\nPlanet exhibition - a showcase of carbon\ncapture technologies, sponsored by oil\nand gas giant Shell. While some may be\npleasantly surprised by Shell\u2019s involvement in climate change science, this was\nnothing but another attempt at green-washing by another company responsible for the crisis we find ourselves in\ntoday.\nThe 2021 IPCC report made it\nstrikingly clear that we are at a point of\nno return, and that it is \u201ccode red for\nhumanity\u201d. The report states that going\nback to 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other\n50-year period over the past 2,000 years,\nand the changes made to many of our\nplanetary system are irreversible on\ntimescales of centuries to even millen-nia. And yet, despite all the overwhelming evidence, climate science is still\nbeing used as a propaganda tool to prop\nup politicians and improve the public\nperception of major companies. In the\nrun up to the 2020 US elections Joe\nBiden widely pledged to end fracking\non federal land, and yet approvals for oil\nand gas on U.S. public lands are on pace\nthis year to reach their highest level\nsince the Bush administration. Biden\u2019s\ncall to \u201ctrust the science\u201d on climate\nchange is another case in an epidemic of\npublic figures using climate science as\na method of creating a positive public\nperception without creating meaningful\nchange. The UK claims to be a world\nleader in climate policy. Indeed, it set\nitself the most ambitious emission\nreduction target globally (a cut of 78%\nby 2035), but the policies enacted by\nthe Tory government have shown an unwillingness to properly engage with the\nscience they seem to promote. Massive\nroadbuilding plans, the HS2 trainline,\nand the expansion of Heathrow airport\nare just some of many large infrastructure projects that will lead to massively\nincreased emissions. The failure of the\nUK government in blocking the first\ndeep coalmine in three decades is a\nhorrifying demonstration of all talk and\nno action climate politics.\nIn the past scientific development\nand policy went hand in hand - the\nspace race was a massive propaganda\ntool for the USSR and the US, but\nthe scientific achievements that came\nfrom that era cannot be disputed. In\ntoday\u2019s world, the space race is led by\ncompanies such as Amazon and SpaceX\nin their quest to build commercial\nrockets. Their scientific achievements\nhelp hide a history of worker abuse and\nexploitation. Amazon\u2019s inclinations are\nwell-known \u2013 it was widely reported\nthis year of Amazon delivery drivers having to urinate in bottles while\ndriving due to harsh time constraints,\nand the working conditions for those\nin warehouses are not much better.\nSpaceX\u2019s successful rocket program is\novershowed by the philosophy of it\u2019s\nowner Elon Musk, who would rather\nfocus on colonising the stars rather than\nsecuring our climate first. Space exploration is an important field and should\nnot be undermined, but Musk\u2019s ambitions to create worker colonies on Mars\n\u2013 a place which would not be under any\ncountry\u2019s control \u2013 would essentially\ncreate a new form of indentured slavery.\nTesla is another company using the image of climate consciousness to promote\nits electric cars yet its investment in\nbitcoin, a cryptocurrency whose mining\nexceeded the yearly power consumption\nof Argentina as a whole, undercuts that\nimage significantly. The issue at hand\nhas never been the lack of scientific\ndevelopment but the misallocation\nof funds to impractical solutions (like\ncarbon capture and hyperloops), and\nthe unwillingness to earnestly engage\nin climate science and actually use its\nfindings.\nAs a partner institution of the Science Museum, the Imperial College Union Council voted not to condemn the\nShell Science Museum greenwashing.\nAs a university which holds within its\nresearch arsenal the Grantham Institute\nfor climate change, this is an appalling\nbetrayal of our duty to science. Unfortunately, this is yet another example of\nImperial\u2019s refusal to divest from fossil\nfuels, and the Union\u2019s apathy on the\nsubject.\nScientific opinion has become a\nskeuomorph of what it once was. It\nis used under the guise of change to\nappeal to more progressive voters, but\nwhen the moment to take responsibility for the way capitalist exploitation\nleft our planet arrives it is pushed into\nthe background. A bastion of scientific\nachievement, the Science Museum is a\nplace to promote the scientific method,\nand to provide a deeper insight into\nhow the world really works.

The most memorable thing\non the track, however, is Groggs\u2019 loud and fantastic\ndelivery \u2013 in fact, this is one of the few tracks where\nyou can unambiguously feel Groggs\u2019 presence, in spite\nof all the drowning noises. \u2018Ground\nZero\u2019, the next track, is where the\nhopelessness peaks in intensity,\nwith the album toning down on\nthe ear-piercing, abrasive sounds in\nfavour of a more monotonous, but\nnonetheless equally blood-boiling\nand cacophonous atmosphere that\nfeelsterrifyinglyclaustrophobicand\nalmost schizophrenic, with Groggs\nand Ritchie competing for verses\nlikedevilishvoicesinsideyourhead.\nThe album then proceeds into\nwhat is undoubtedly my favourite\ntrack, \u2018Top Picks for You\u2019 \u2013 a song\nwhich completely mentally obliterated me. At its core,\nthe song is the sound of grieving itself, but not in a\ntypical sad, piano-led, tear-jerker, Titanic sort of way \u2013\nthis is raw grief translated into sound with little to no\nattempttomakethetrackmoredigestibleorappealing,\nretaining all the messiness and mental disruptiveness\nthat comes along with the sensation \u2013 something\ncaptured perfectly by Corey\u2019s masterful production.\nLyrically, I find this the best track on the album, with\nRitchie\u2019s verses being more heart-breaking than ever,\nfulloftouchingrecollectionsofalovedone\u2019shabits.My\nfavourite line on the whole project is found on this cut,\nwithRitchiereferencingametaphoricalalgorithmthat\nis still running, patiently awaiting\nthe person\u2019s return as if nothing\nhappened (\u201cYour patterns are still in\nplace and algorithm still in action//\njust workin\u2019 so that you can just//\njump right back in\u201d ), but the person\nnever jumping back in, leaving\nbehind all these painful reminders.\nThe following track, \u2018Wild Wild\nWest\u2019, feels just as disorienting\nand paranoid as the rest, with a\nstrange, chaotic ramble about 5G\nand Will Smith cooperating with\nthe noisy sound to achieve this.\n\u2018Postpostpartum\u2019 then reads like\na desperate but futile attempt at escaping this mental\ndisintegration, with Ritchie feeling stuck in time.\nCombined with the message of this track, \u2018Knees\u2019 then\nstrikesmeasevenmorepotentthanwhenIfirstheardit\nas a single, adding a layer of spatial confinement to this\nclaustrophobia. The only glimpse of light this project\noffers us is contained within the closer, with a slightly\nmore hopeful instrumental and verses like \u201cBye storm\u201d\nand \u201cShow must go on\u201d, but the optimism remains very\nunconvincing, full of fatigue and despondency, as the\nnature of all storms is that they come back. The feeling\nof peace is only ever temporary. The second half of the\ncloser is purely instrumental, almost as if there should\nhave been vocals over it, making Groggs\u2019 absence\nglaringly apparent. I really feel like no production\nchoice could have been a better, more Injury Reserve\node to a passed friend than this.\nOverall, I can\u2019t remember the last time I was this\nawestruckbyapieceofexperimentalhiphop,withonly\nJPEGMAFIA\u2019s Veteran and Death Grips\u2019 Money Store\nstriking me as comparable in terms of boldness, and\neven these amazing projects inflict nowhere near this\nmuch emotional turmoil on their listeners.

Injury Reserve\u2019s incredible\nhip hop masterpiece posthumously honours Stepa\u2019s\nconstant wish to \u201cmake some weird shit\u201d, and it does\nso in the best possible way which is neither pretentious\nnor shallow. Honestly, after this insane rollercoaster\nthat not only pushes the boundaries of hip hop, but in\nmany ways music itself, I cannot wait to hear what the\nduo has in store for us next.\n\u201c\nI CAN\u2019T\nREMEMBER THE\nLAST TIME I WAS\nTHIS AWESTRUCK\nBY A PIECE OF\nEXPERIMENTAL\nHIP HOP\nMark Twain was once quoted as saying, \u201cI want\nto be in Kentucky when the world ends as they\nare always twenty years behind.\u201d Climate-anxiety and\nanticipatory grief are feelings many of us have begun\nto grapple with, as we fear time is running out to\nmitigate the effects of the climate\ncrisis, many of which have begun\nto reach close to home. Avoiding\nsuccumbing to nihilistic defeatism\nabout climate disaster is tricky, particularly when so much of what we\nhear is bad news, and when individual actions feel futile in the face of\ncatastrophe.\nThe pressure we are all feeling is\nbecoming reflected in unobvious\nindustries. Take the music industry\n\u2013 I never considered how the arts\ncould contribute to climate change\nuntil I heard about a report based on Massive Attack\u2019s touring data by the Tyndall Centre for Climate\nChange Research on the radio one morning. Since\nthen, I have witnessed conversation about climate\nchange permeate deeper within the music scene. After\ntuning in to the Ivors Academy\u2019s annual lecture on\nmusic and the climate emergency, I realised these conversations had been ongoing for a long time \u2013 I just\nwasn\u2019t paying attention.\nThis year\u2019s panel was led by musician Brian Eno,\nalongside Professor Brian Cox, and climate scientist\nDr Tamsin Edwards. The event\nwas sobering, yet optimistic, best\nsummarised by Edwards\u2019 final\ncomment, \u201cClimate change is not\nsomething that is won or lost \u2013 it\nis a curve that we can keep bending\ndown to a better future. What is\nnext is up to us, and only future\ngenerations will know how we did.\u201d\nThe conversation about the effect\nof the industry on the planet occur\nclose to home. Eno admits many\nof his ponderings on what must be\ndone occur whilst he walks through\nHyde Park every morning. \u201cStop talking about the\nclimate emergency and start talking about the climate opportunity,\u201d he says, as he speaks of his house\nflooding on Christmas Day, and how this brought his\ncommunity together with long lasting effect. \u201cClimate\nchange is the alibi we can use to change society to be\nthe kind of world we would like to be in. We all know\nthere are so many things wrong that are very intractable unless you have a huge excuse.\u201d He details how\nmany of the actions we must take to avoid climate\ndisaster are actions that should be done regardless of\ndisaster, in order to improve the world. He describes\nhis goal to reform the music industry into a leading\nexample of a sustainable, greened industry.\nDespite the facts presented being bleak, the optimism and vision of the panellists provided hope\nagainst a background of existential despair \u2013 and even\nmore musicians are becoming impassioned about\nclimate activism. \u201cArt has the responsibility to try to\nenlighten, instead of just entertain,\u201d says Matt Berninger, frontman of indie-rock band The National \u2013\nand artists are shouldering this responsibility, raising\nawareness through song across all genres. Standout\nclimate activist songs include Anohni\u2019s satirical \u201c4 Degrees\u201d, released back in 2016, Declan McKenna\u2019s \u201cSagittarius A*\u201d and All Star\u2019s \u201cSmash Mouth\u201d, however\nmy personal favourite is Weyes Blood\u2019s Titanic Rising,\nan ode to the natural world and a warning to protect\nand nurture it.

We would get hailstones\nas well.\nOne rainy season, the weather started changing \u2013 it had become sporadic.\nIt had been hot for quite some weeks\nafter planting seeds and earlier rains.\nSeeds came out, but rain would come\nback at certain stages to nourish seed-lings. The rain would leave for weeks\non end, and so crops suffered. Then it\nwould rain hailstones and heavy rain\nthat shredded the cabbage leaves and\ntomatoes. So, the ground was soaked\nbut one time it proved to be a miracle,\nbecause when the rain went and sun\ncame - we got giant cabbages and to-matoes! It was as if the soil was fertil-ised. We\u2019d eat cabbage and tomatoes\nin salad during a season when it didn\u2019t\nrain as much as it should have. It used\nto rain from September to March. By\nDecember we would have sweetcorn\nto eat, cook, and roast.\nFrom late 90s it has been changing.\nWAIT, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO\nBE RAINY WHILE WE WERE\nON HOLIDAY? IT WAS 30 DEGREES ALMOST EVERY DAY!\nIt would have been pouring, but\nit was just scorching hot. It used to\nrain all night, we would wake up and\nit would be wet outside. There was\nnothing in the gardens during December 2019.\nIt would have been muddy and\nrainy all month. In fact, we used to\npray for sun on Christmas.\nNowadays it\u2019s just hot all December, with maybe some rain around\nApril, rain is sporadic now.\nAround April time we would harvest the crops, this would fit into\nschool holidays each year. In recent\nyears, it pours in March - which is\nwhen the produce should be drying.\nBetween September and December,\nthe rain disappears. Sometimes, when\nthe rain appears, it just pours and\ndrowns the crops.\nYou remember, don\u2019t you? That it\nonly rained one time when we were\nthere and, even then, the ground dried\nup on the same day.\nThe river that used to run along the\nfarm is gone. When it rains it doesn\u2019t\nfill up.\nHOW DO ALL THE CHANGES MAKE YOU FEEL?\nIt makes me feel sad.\nHOW HAVE PEOPLE\u2019S LIVES\nCHANGED OVER THE YEARS?\nSome fruits don\u2019t grow as they\nused to. Especially the wild fruits that\nwould be in abundance and available\nfor people to pick during droughts.\nAlso, having three meals a day\nhas been a luxury for some since the\n90s. Tea and bread for breakfast is a\nWestern thing. Traditionally we have\nporridge or sweet potatoes, with tea.\nLunch is whatever produce you harvested during the previous year. People keep their food in storage equivalent to a pantry. So, you could have a\nyear\u2019s supply of: dried peanuts, dried\nsweetcorn, dried Round nuts, dried\nchickpeas, dried soyabeans, sweet and\nnormal potatoes, or pumpkins. This\nfood was supposed to sustain households throughout the dry season and\nthe following year.\nMy family used to grow loads of\ncrops. Cotton, sunflowers, rice - in\nfact we used to eat organic brown rice\nand process it ourselves. We would\nalso make our own peanut butter.\nWHY DON\u2019T THEY GROW A\nVARIETY ANYMORE?\nWater levels have gone down, the\nrainy season changed so some crops\nare not grown anymore. Sekuru (Sho-na word for Grandfather) loved farm-ing. When I was younger, he set up irrigation pipes and would line up seeds\nwith string on a straight line. He used\ncows to plough the land and then\nwould go put the seeds in. We used\nto have equipment to cover the seeds\nand cultivate the weeds. Irrigation\npipes stretched all the way from the\nfields to the borehole, where someone\nwould be pumping, and on the other\nend someone would be watering with\npipes. That system stopped because\nthe borehole supply started getting\nlow. So, we started relying more on\nrain but that wasn\u2019t reliable for irrigation either.\nARE RURAL PEOPLE NOTICING THESE TRENDS?\nThey\u2019ve noticed but some think\nthat maybe next year they can do\nsomething different, or something\nwill change. Even though for some\nyears they\u2019ve had less produce.\nCOULD YOU SAY MORE ON\nWHAT IT IS LIKE NOW?\nThere have been floods now, and we\nnever used to have them. Chimanimani had a terrible flood in 2019, during\nCyclone Idai. Schools were evacuated\nand people died.\nI remember at the beginning of the\nmillennium there was a terrible flood.\nIf I recall, in 2000 there was a cyclone,\nI never used to hear of this before.\nPeople had their houses washed away\nand people died. We never heard of\nthat growing up. It would rain and\nrain, but we never heard of a \u2018flood\u2019\nhappening. What makes it worse is\nthat most people in rural areas build\nhouses with mud walls and grass\nrooves. These houses crumbled and\nwere easily washed away.\nAnother thing, we used to apply\ncow dung to fertilise the soil, but\nwhen the weather started changing\nand it didn\u2019t rain as much, the manure\nin the ground would \u2018burn\u2019 the crops\nand damage the produce.\nWhen we went back home, the\ngrass was just dry. Some days, Grandma\u2019s pumpkin leaves around the yard\nwould look withered. Growing up, we\nused to be able to sit in the sun, but we\ncan\u2019t do that anymore - the sun is too\nhot. When we were there in December you noticed how everyone would\nsit in the shade, didn\u2019t you? Yet growing up you could work in the fields in\nthe heat. In fact, we never used to have\ntemperatures like 30 degrees unless it\nwas drought. The temperature would\nbe 20-something if it was sunny,\nwhich was comfortably hot because\nyou could walk and work in that heat.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK\nSHOULD BE DONE?\nWe need to go out there and talk\nabout climate change, make people aware of it. Let them know that\nwhat they\u2019re facing is actually climate\nchange, let them know what is contributing to it around the globe and\nin Zim. Zimbabweans need to go out\nthere, talk to and lobby the non-cor-rupt MPs to try to bring some change.\nLots of factors are contributing glob-ally, Zim is obviously contributing\ntoo \u2013 for example we have many un-roadworthy cars, and millions of unfit\nbuses on the roads.\nThere\u2019s not much production there\nbecause of the economic situation, so\nI think the main problem is cars that\nare not roadworthy. There is no MOT\nsystem over there so anything with\nfour wheels can be on the road. That\nneeds to change because anyone and\neveryone has a car there. The government needs to introduce viable public\ntransport; and renewable sources of\nenergyneedtobeprioritised.Weneed\ntrains to connect people between Harare and Marondera instead of hundreds of car trips. There needs to be\ndevelopment in Zim. People are okay\ngetting on with their day-to-day lives,\nbut they may not be aware they\u2019re\ncontributing to climate change.\nSome people are ignorant, and\nthey aren\u2019t thinking about their great\ngrandchildren and future generations.\nThey\u2019re just thinking of the now.\nMy mother\u2019s account is sobering but,\nsadly, millions across the world are facing harsher experiences than she did.\nThey do not get to escape the reality of\nthe climate crisis like some do.\n\n"

For\nexample, the World Bank\u2019s\n2021 Groundswell report\nstated that if no actions\nare taken, approximately\n216 million people could\nbecome \u2018internal climate\nmigrants\u2019 by 2050. Particularly in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica, East Asia and the\nPacific, and South Asia.\nWe need to continue listening to the\nexperts, scientists, and activists who\nhave been arduously educating us. However, I am concerned about the people\nwhose voices are not heard, especially\nthose who do not have\nthe luxury of viewing the\nclimate crisis as a topic\nof debate.\nAs someone who has\nspent most of their life\nin the United Kingdom,\nI have always had access\nto information regarding\nglobal warming, climate\nchange and environmen-talism. So, for me, the\nimpending climate crisis\nhas always been on the\nperiphery. Despite this,\nI rarely felt a sense of urgency or fear and my lifestyle has hardly been af-fected. This is a privilege\nI would not have known\nhad I not immigrated to\nthe UK.\nIn December 2019 my family and I\nwent on a three-week trip \u2018back home\u2019.\n\u2018Back home\u2019 meant an 11-hour flight\ndown to the southern hemisphere, deep\ninto the southern regions of Africa to\nmy birth country of Zimbabwe. The last\ntime I was there was August 2011 and\nthat passage of time meant I had lost\nthe rose-tinted lenses of childish youth.\nNow, Zimbabwe is a country which has a\nplethora of social, economic, and political problems, but it was the environmental changes lurking in the background\nthat left me with a lingering feeling of\nhopelessness.\nThe first day we drove past the corn\nfields on my maternal Grandparents\u2019\nfarm, I immediately noticed the crops\nwere not as lush as I had expected; crops\nthat had the potential to rival my height\nbarely met my waist. In the moment, I\nbrushed my concern aside \u2013 instead I attributed what I saw to the fact that my\nGrandparents were getting older, and so\nof course the upkeep had been slipping.\nOnly later, through a conversation with\nmy mother and grandmother did I naively realise that the suffering crops were\npart of a concerning trend beyond their\ncontrol.\nSo, I decided to sit down, interview,\nand listen to my mother.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 37\nCOMMENT\nReflecting on climate change - A\nrural Zimbabwean perspective\nComment editor Khama Gunde sits down with her mum to discuss how climate change has impacted their rural community over\nthe past few decades\nWE NEVER\nHEARD\nOF THAT\nGROWING UP.\nIT WOULD\nRAIN AND\nRAIN, BUT\nWE NEVER\nHEARD OF\nA \u2018FLOOD\u2019\nHAPPENING.\n\u201c\nKhamaGunde\nCommentEditor\nThe African continent shown on a globe\nPhoto credits: Unsplash, @jameswiseman\nWHAT WAS THE FARM LIKE\nIN YOUR YOUTH?\nWe were used to heavy rains during every rainy season growing up. In\nfact, we had what we\u2019d call \u2018bumper\nharvests\u2019 \u2013 where we\u2019d harvest huge\namounts of crops each year.\nWe used to sell our produce to the\nGrain Marketing Board, and we\u2019d\nhavetonnesofsweetcornforsaleevery\nyear. At once stage the equivalent of\nthe BBC, the Zimbabwean broadcasting corporation, came to take a video\nof our farm to show on TV. At that\ntime the land was all green and lush.\nThere was a river that ran along the\nfarm that used to be flowing and full\nof water all year round.\nThat river is now non-existent. It\nhas been dry for years, decades.\nOn rainy seasons, after the rain we\nwould go with buckets to fields parallel to the farm. We would catch fish\nbecause they\u2019d be swimming up the\nriver but on the ground. My siblings\nand I would be catching fish with\nhands and putting them in buckets.\nWe would watch migrating birds\nfrom Europe as they would follow the\nrainy belt. The birds would be ahead\nof rain, so that\u2019s how we would know\nthe rains were coming - like when\nthey talk about pressure system on the\nTV. We used to call them \u2018stork birds\u2019,\nthose white birds. When we saw lots\nof them we would know rain is com-ing.\nSo, we used to plant all our crops\nthe same time each year, plough the\nfields, put seeds in ground, weeks before the rain and the rain would come\napproximately the same time each\nyear. So, seeds would germinate, and\ncrops would grow until harvest time.\nWERE THERE DIFFICULT\nTIMES?\nDrought came, I remember, two\ntimes. One time was in the 80s and\ncows died. The cows would try to\ndrink water in marshlands and would\nget stuck. A few died since there was\nno grass and not enough water.\nWe had boreholes \u2013 one for irrigation and one for drinking. They have\nnever dried up; they have been there\nsince before I was born. In the 90s,\nthe drinking borehole began deplet-ing, but it still sustained the village\ncommunity (including teachers and\nstudents from my school). People\nwould come to fetch water as early as\n4am, because their supplies dried up.\nBy 6am, it would be a little muddy but\nstill drinkable \u2013 not contaminated, it\nhas always been safe. To this day that\nborehole has been sustaining lives.\nOne drought year there wasn\u2019t\nmuch to eat, some days we would\njust have maize meal porridge with\nsugar. But there would be no food to\neat afterschool, maybe a cup of water\nwith two or three spoons of sugar for\nlunch in the afternoon. So, from the\nprevious years\u2019 harvest we had preserved maizemeal which we kept for\nporridge and sadza (a staple food in\nZimbabwe made from maize flour\nand water). Breakfast would be porridge with sugar and peanut butter, or\ntea with bread. Supper would be sadza\nwith vegetables or small fish. Beef\nmaybe once a week and chicken was\non an occasion, Easter or Christmas.\nVegetables weren\u2019t doing so well\nin the garden, during the drought,\nthey died from the sun, scorched re-ally, and lack of water. Some nights\nwe would roast dry sweetcorn kernels\nto make maputi (a very popular corn\nsnack). Some nights, dried sweet po-tatoes. In Zim, the staple food is sadza\n\u2013 with vegetables or meat of any kind.\n\n"

When\nit comes to London, this is nothing more than a drop\nin the ocean of the things only a tube journey away.\nAnd when you say, \u201coutside\u201d, I want you to mean it and\nnot just be talking about sitting on Queen\u2019s lawn. And\nI can guide you on the right path - through food.\nIn the spirit of sustainability, I am also going to stay\non my usual theme of fun, out-of-the-box places to eat\nout in but also give it a vegan twist. I present you with\nFlower Burger, an import from Italy and the first fast\nfood restaurant serving vegan and colourful burgers.\nThe colourful selection draws you in with burgers that\nlook like something out of a SpongeBob episode. But\nyou come for the buns and stay for the taste. The menu\nis all vegan with simple, no-nonsense ingredients.\nWhat you see is what you get.

The buns taste\nlike\u2026 buns! They achieve the colour\nspectrum through adding natural\nextracts to the doughs, but these make\nno real difference to the flavour palette.\nIt\u2019s a missed opportunity to achieve more\ncomplex overall flavours through complementary or\ncontrasting flavours to the patties. However, it also\nmeans that you don\u2019t have to force yourself through a\nburger you don\u2019t like because you wanted to make sure\nthe bun matched your outfit for Instagram. Another\nbenefit of the unique selling point of the buns is that\nyou know they are fresh \u2013 there\u2019s nowhere else you\u2019re\ngoing to find them.

You get a light\nand fluffy bread experience.\nThis is a contrast to the dense, veggie-packed\nburgers. Usually within a burger joint, the things that\ndifferentiates each burger is the toppings and sauces.\nHere the patty themselves are pulling their weight in\nthis department as well. Let\u2019s face it, there are much\nmore grains and vegetables out there for the picking\nthat the meats we find socially acceptable in western\nsociety. Flower Burger brings something different to\nthe table by not trying to imitate meat like other well-known vegan patties from the capital. Instead, they\nkeep it simple with a short ingredient list that is easily\naccessible from their website for each of\ntheir five different burgers. Although\nthey\u2019ve got everything from broccoli to\nred peppers to rice to\u2026 oat flakes rolled\nup in these creations, they keep it all\nnatural. They pride themselves on the fact\nthat no preservative or artificial flavours\nor colours were used in the making of\ntheir rainbow magic. This leads to a healthy dish high\nis protein and fibre. There is no need to wonder what\u2019s\nin the Krabby Patty secret formula.\nIt would be nonsensical to compare their patties\nto the meaty equivalent because they are going for\ndifferent things. What I can say is that Flower Burger\u2019s\npatties do stand well on their own two feet \u2013 even\nthough their source had no feet. They are very filling,\nand the toppings and sauces help add to the overall\nexperience and really round out the flavours to bring\nsomething different to each burger. I had the Tangy\nChickpea which did exactly what it said it would and\nthen some. The flavour was sharp and tart. I wish there\nwere more textures going on between the buns though\n\u2013maybesomethingcrispy.Everythingtastedveryfresh\nand bright, and the patties are grilled instead of fried,\nso you won\u2019t be feeling sluggish after this even though\nit is fast food. I got the meal deal but I wish they has\nmore interesting options for sides and drinks.\nOverall, I think this is a great place for the vegans\nof Imperial to add to their arsenal where you aren\u2019t\njust an afterthought. Although this place is not going\nto be converting any omnivores anytime soon, I still\nthink the curiosity from the bright colours will get\nthem through the door so it will work for the whole\nparty.Theyarealsoahealthieralternativetootherfast-foodplacesyoucouldhavechosenfromtheareathatis\nmore conscious of the environment. If we are keeping\nit real, this might be the only opportunity some of you\nfreshers will get a chance to get a your five-a-day now\nthat you have to fend for yourself.

Take Grimes, for exam-ple. Miss Anthropocene is a dystopian record focusing\non environmental collapse (with no real substance),\nwhich is distasteful at best coming from the partner of\none of the richest men in the world. This surface-level,\nperformative activism highlights not only the class\ndisconnect surrounding eco-collapse, but that political songs without activism is meaningless.\nColdplay, The 1975 and U2 are perhaps unlikely\npioneers of climate activism within the music in-dustry. Coldplay have refused to do tours that are\nnot carbon neutral, and The 1975 launched the first\nUK festival powered by sustainably sourced biofuels\nand solar energy. Massive Attack partnered with the\nTyndall Centre for Climate Change Research to study\nthe effects of touring on the climate, releasing recommendations for venues such as switching to renewable\nenergy, incentivising fans to travel via public transport\nto gigs, and for tours to be better scheduled to eliminate the need for private jets and minimise flying.\nHowever, individual fans have a role too. Vinyl\nrecords are made from crude oil, after all, with only a\nsmall percentage being made from recycled plastics.\nFans must become actively involved in campaigns,\nsupport radical artists, and as the industry changes,\nbe prepared to boycott artists who refuse to adapt\nto more sustainable practises. There are many musi-cian-led climate activist campaigns, such as the Music\nDeclares Emergency \u2018No Music on a Dead Planet\u2019\ncampaign, which runs events such as Climate Music\nBlowout to fundraise for climate activism through live\nperformances. This year\u2019s event is happening at EartH,\nHackney on 17th October this year, featuring live\nperformances from bands such as Black Country, New\nRoad, and Porridge Radio (tickets cost \u00a315).\nChanging the music industry is not the magic bullet\nto avoiding climate disaster, but every new policy and\ntonne of CO2 we can avoid emitting helps protect\nour future. I think back to Brian Cox\u2019s words at the\nMusic and the Climate Emergency lecture: \u201c4 billion\nyears to go from the origin of life to something than\ncan think and feel and write music and do art [\u2026]. We\nlive on a planet that has been stable for 4 billion years.\nThe climate has not changed catastrophically enough\nto break the chain of life in 4 billion years. As we\nconsider what we are doing to this little world tonight,\nit is worth bearing that in mind.

I\u2019ve been interested in\npreventing climate change for as long as\nI can remember, even being a member\nof the behemoth lobbying group that\nwas the \u201cEco committee\u201d at my primary\nschool. Even at the osteoporotic age of\n23, man-made climate change predates\nme by some margin. In the 60s, it was\nbecoming clear that CO2 affected the\nworld\u2019s climate. Evidence mounted, and\nin 2006, Al Gore\u2019s \u2018An Inconvenient\nTruth\u2019 was released and won an Oscar,\nproviding one of the first real wake-up\ncalls to the public. To an audience of\ndeveloped nations, all this was terrifying\nyet merely academic - warmer summers\nwere welcomed by most with open\narms, and the foretold natural disasters\nwere yet to be seen en masse. 2021, I\nbelieve, is the turning point in our lived\nexperiences. This year we have seen\nclimate catastrophe across the globe: the\n\u201cheatdome\u201dinthePacificNorthWestof\nthe US and Canada broke temperature\nrecords, started fires that razed villages\nto the ground, and killed hundreds of\npeople. Wildfires tore across Greece\nand Turkey, displacing thousands and\ndestroying countless homes. The \u201cwet\nbulb\u201d temperature critical for human\nsurvival, an environment where a damp\ncloth over a thermometer registers 35\nCelsiusorhigher,wasbrokenatmultiple\nlocations across the globe for the first\ntime ever. In these conditions, humans\nare not able to survive. Conversely,\nmany parts of the world saw extreme\nflooding: Germany and Belgium were\nravaged by torrents that caused over\n200 deaths and incalculable damage\nto infrastructure. Monsoons in India\nhave been unprecedentedly erratic.\nDescribed as \u201cone of the most stable\nweather systems on the planet\u201d, rainfall\nwas shotgunned across the country in a\nway that left vast swathes of land flooded\nwhilst leaving all else in a water deficit.\nExtreme rainfall in Henan province,\nChina, killed over 300 people and left\ncountless homes destroyed.\nThis is it. So many freak weather\nevents occurred this summer that it\u2019s\nwrong to still call them freak. The IPCC\nreport released this August was the most\ndamning report of our situation so far\nand was set apart from the rest by one\nkey observation - we cannot stop this.\nThe report makes clear that damage has\nalready been done to the planet that\nwould take millennia to reverse. We can\navoid a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d if COP26 goes\nperfectly, but events such as those listed\nabove will only get more common and\nmore severe.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n14 Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nENVIRONMENT\nClimate change has reached the West\nPodcast Recommendation: GreenBiz 350\nIf you\u2019re interested in\nlearning about how businesses are tackling (or not\ntackling) climate change,\ncheck out GreenBiz 360!\nAn informative podcast\nthat covers the latest news\non various topics, including\nclimate technology, circular\neconomy, transportation,\nenergy, food systems and\nmore.

Every week, we\u2019ll\ndiscuss what is happening in the world of economics\nand finance whilst trying to apply our own spin\nand analysis by looking back through historical\ndata that we can get our hands on or through basic\nmathematical modelling.

Unlike a lot of Imperial courses\nthis year, there will be (fingers crossed, again) an\nin-person exam at the end of the SEC so that your\nlearning experience is as authentic as it can be.\nThere is a lot more that we\u2019re doing this year that\nI wish I could cover in just one page e.g. external\nspeakers, cryptocurrency workshops, associates\u2019\nprogrammes\u2026 the list can go on!\nFor the final 120 words I have left (probably 100 by\nthe end of this sentence), I\u2019ll explain how you can get\ninvolved in our society.\nWhen Freshers\u2019 Fair takes place on Tuesday the 5th\nof October, you\u2019ll be able to find our committee at our\nstall, where you can ask us more about our projects, the\nSEC and anything you have on your mind.\nYou can also sign up to our mailing list using your\nImperial login credentials on the union\u2019s society listing\npage \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to find us in the A\u2013Z on the\nunion\u2019s main website.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nNEWS\nNews.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n4\nAre the College hypocrites? - Interview\nwith Chair of the Sustainability Board\nAs may be apparent, the College is not\nexactly world-leading in its internal\nsustainability policies. I sat down\nwith Sam Lee, your Deputy President\nfor Finance and Services and Chair\nof the Services and Sustainability\nBoard, to discuss how the Union\nis lobbying the College to change,\nand what powers it has exactly.\nQ. What is the SSB and\nwhat is your role in it?\nA. SSB stands for Services and\nSustainabilityBoard,Iamthechair.\nIt is 1 of 5 sub-committees of the Union\nCouncil. Each Officer Trustee has a subcommittee within the Union and SSB is\nmine so I chair it. It is comprised of two\nsmaller committees, the Sustainability\nCommittee and the Events and Venues\nCommittee. I see this as a crucial\ndialogue to be maintained within the\nUnion as one should always consider\nthe other. There is a split though - only\nthose elected into sustainability-based\nroles are able to vote\non sustainability\nissues. Members\ninclude the Ethics and\nEnvironment Officer,\nEnvironmental Soc\nPresident etc. On\nServices, we have some\nbarstaff,aDramSocrep,\netc. These reps together work towards a\nsustainable but productive way forward.\nQ. What is the board\u2019s\nremit environmentally?\nA. As DPFS, one of the by-law\nclauses is that my role is focused\non Union sustainability, as well as\nlobbying the College. We try to\nencourage the College to do better at\nsustainability internally, as well as with\ntheir associations with other companies\nQ. Do you have any specific\nexamples of what you\u2019re\nlobbying the College on?\nA. As a sub-committee of the Union\nCouncil it operates in the same\nway as others, where any member can\nproduce a paper and bring it to the\nCouncil and it is voted on. If approved\nI, and other Union members, can be\ncompelled to undertake certain tasks\nor lobby on certain issues. An example\nis a cooperation with the anti-food\nwaste company TooGoodToGo, where\nstudents and staff will hopefully be\nallowed to purchase food at a cheaper\nprice when they\u2019re about to go out of\ndate.Wecurrentlydon\u2019tfullyunderstand\nthe College\u2019s wastage programme,\nincluding the remit of the College in\nfood waste disposal where the food\ncould not be sold on, so this is something\nwe need to hear more from them on.\nQ. Can the College overrule\nthe SSB on anything?\nA. The SSB sits within the Union\nand not the College, meaning the\nCollege technically doesn\u2019t have to do\nanything the SSB asks it to do. The SSB\ncan only lobby or advise. However, as\nreps who will continue to foster good\nrelations with College members of\nstaff, we hope that they\nwill realise this is in the\ninterest of students and\nimplement changes\nwhere they can. So far\nthere have been clear\nissues that the College\nwill not budge on\ndespite Union pressure.\nQ. Many students are unhappy with\nthe Union\u2019s and the College\u2019s use\nof single-use plastics, in cups, cutlery etc.,\nwhich has been massively exacerbated\nby Covid. Does the SSB have any\nplans in improving the footprint here?\nA. As we look forward to welcome\nweek we have been mindful of this,\ngiven the large amount of food and drink\nthat will likely be bought. I have spoken\nto the Director of Venues and Director\nof Finance and Resources and we have\nagreed that all cutlery will from now\nbe wooden rather than plastic. This is\neffective already and the Union will buy\nno more plastic cutlery, however there is\nstill some plastic cutlery in circulation\nwhich had been bought before the\ndecision was made. In the lead-up to\nWelcome Week, the venues team has\nbeen tasked with coming up with wider-ranging solution to single-use plastics,\nwhich at the moment is looking like it\u2019ll\ncome in the form of a reusable plastic\nwhich can be used at\ntimes where we are\nunable to serve in glass.\nAs many returning\nstudents will know,\nthis happens at certain\ntimes of the evening\nat FiveSixEight, where\ncontinued use of glass\ncould lead to injury of\nparticularly inebriated\nstudents. These can\neither be washed and\nre-used, or taken out\nfrom a company that\nwill continually come, clean them and\nreturn them for a very reasonable fee.\nThe exact scheme is not yet decided. We\nare able to afford to do these schemes\nthanks to the new funding model\nwhich the Union recently switched to.\nQ. Where does food waste\ncurrently go from the Union?\nA. Food waste is currently very low\nas it\u2019s mostly frozen. Food that\ndoes need to be wasted, for example\nfrom unfinished plates, is wasted\nunder the College\u2019s wider scheme of\nbiodegradation. Excess food is fed\ninto an anaerobic bioreactor which\nbreaks it down and uses the energy\nreleased to generate electricity,\nwhich in turn powers the College.\nQ. Where have\ndecisions been\nmade? For example,\non the wooden cutlery,\nis the use of \u201cgreen\u201d\nalternatives assessed\nqualitatively?Iknow,for\nexample, that it is often\nmore energy intensive\nand requires a lot\nmore water to generate\nwooden cutlery when\ncompared with plastic\ncutlery. Is there a data-driven way to come to these decisions\nor is it currently just on gut feel?\nA. Truthfully at the moment it is\nmore intuitive, however that\u2019s\nsomething we want to move away from.\nOur Back to Basics plan in the Union\nincludes growth of our representation\nteam, including hiring a policy officer\nSam Lovatt Editor in Chief talks to Sam\nLee, DPFS and Union Sustainability Chair\nInterview\n\u201c\nFOOD WASTE\nIS CURRENTLY\nVERY LOW \u201c\nAS A STEM\nINSTITUTION\nWE NEED TO\nMAKE THESE\nDECISIONS ON\nA DATA-DRIVEN\nBASIS\n\n"

Even if\nyou haven\u2019t heard of it yet, it\u2019ll become\nan increasingly common topic of\nconversation over the next few weeks.\nThe COP26 is the official United\nNations Climate Change Conference,\nhosted annually since 1995 (except for\n2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic).\nIt is one of the most influential summits\non climate change, and this year it will\nbe held from October 31st to November\n12th in Glasgow. The parties involved\ninclude200+countries,NGOsandfaith\ngroups who were a\npart of the United\nNations Framework\nConvention on\nClimate Change\n( U N F C C C ) ,\nset up at the Rio\nEarth Summit in\n1992. Since COP\u2019s\ne s t a b l i s h m e n t\ncrucial agreements\nhave been made\nto limit climate\nchange, including the 1997 Kyoto\nProtocol and the 2016 Paris Agreement.\nPerhaps more well known, the latter\nwas an agreement made at the COP21,\ninvolving all signatory countries to\nreducegreenhousegas(GHG)emissions\nthrough \u2018Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs)\u2019 that will be\nreviewed every five years. In essence,\neveryone is responsible for setting and\nachieving their own targets for limiting\nglobal warming to 1.5 degrees. So far,\nit\u2019s clear that some nations are a lot more\nambitious than others.\nThe conversations between the\nUNFCCC parties are guided by the\nresearch findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change\n(IPCC), a group of climate-change\nexperts who publish an assessment\nreport (AR) every five years, based on\nratified scientific evidence. These reports\nare intended to be objective, informative\nassessments that can guide policy but\nare not prescriptive. Three working\ngroups put the information together:\nWorking Group I covers The Physical\nScience Basis, including evidentiary\nsupport on the latest climate science\nknowledge, Working Group II covers\nclimate change impacts, adaptations and\nvulnerabilities, and Working Group III\noffers suggestions to mitigate climate\nchange. The most\nrecent report, IPCC\nAR6, came out in\nAugust this year.\nThe findings in\nAR6 and the context\nof the pandemic\nis why COP 26 is\ngarnering so much\nattention. Not only\nare we far off-track\nfrom accomplishing\nthe goal of limiting\nwarming to 1.5 degrees as laid out in\nthe Paris Agreement, but AR6 made it\nunequivocally clear that human-induced\nGHG emissions are responsible for\nglobal warming and its related climate\ntragedies. More bleak is the conclusion\nthat we will exceed global warming of\nnotjust1.5degrees,but2degreeswithin\nthis century unless GHG emissions\nare significantly reduced. As David\nMiliband, CEO of the International\nRescueCommittee,stated,\u201cThewindow\nof opportunity to avoid dangerous\nclimate change is closing more quickly\nthan previously thought\u201d.\nMoreover, the economic decline\nbrought on by the COVID-19\npandemic, whilst tragic, is also an\nopportunity for society to build back\nstronger \u2013 perhaps not even building\nback but re-building an entirely new way\nof operating society based on principles\nof sustainability and justice for all. Thus,\nthe outcomes of COP26 will shape not\njust the next decade but also the future\nof our species and planet.\nCOP26 is split into three sections,\nwiththefirstbeingthemainnegotiations\ninvolving world leaders and experts in\nthe field. There will also be observers,\nincluding NGOs, specialised UN\nagencies (e.g. the WHO) and registered\npress organisations. The second part\ninvolves exhibitions and fringe events\nfordelegatesand,finally,thethirdpartis\nmadeupoftalksandeventsforthepublic.\nSome key topics to be discussed include\ncarbon market mechanisms, funding\nfor loss and damage, climate finance,\nnature-based solutions, and timeframes\nfor NDCs. Felix\u2019s environmental section\nwill be covering each of these topics in\nthe next few weeks leading up to the\nconference.\nIt\u2019s time for governments and societies\nto set more ambitious targets and, more\nimportantly, take urgent collaborative\naction to achieve them \u2013 one aligned\nto put our world at a net-zero emission\nstatus by 2050. Of course, there are\nplenty of ways to do this, including\nphasing out the use of coal, cutting back\non deforestation, greater adoption of\nelectric vehicles, investing in renewable\nenergy, and providing the necessary\naid for less economically developed\ncountries. But like anything, knowing is\nnot the same as doing. As students, we\ncan do our part by educating ourselves,\nthen making individual choices to\nlimit environmental damage. To learn\nmore about the COP26 and the IPCC\nreport, visit ukcop26.org or ipcc.ch and\nfollow any of their social media outlets.\nYou can also find an excellent summary\nof the IPCC report\u2019s key findings on\nthe \u2018Headline Statements from the\nSummary for Policymakers\u2019 document\navailable on the IPCC home page. Most\nimportantly, start taking action \u2013 get\ninvolved in student organisations, join\nclimate change campaigns, re-examine\nyour lifestyle \u2013 there are a million ways\nto help, and every decision counts.\nMonami Miyamoto Environment Editor\nPhoto: Ria Sopala on Pixabay\nWE WILL EXCEED\nGLOBAL WARMING\nOF OF NOT JUST\n1.5 DEGREES, BUT 2\nDEGREES WITHIN\nTHIS CENTURY\n\u201c\nFRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER 2021\n13\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nEnvironment View online here!\n\n"

    "content": "\u201cScience without philosophy, facts without\nperspective and valuation, cannot save us from\nhavoc and despair. Science gives us knowledge, but\nonly philosophy can give us wisdom.\u201d\n- Will Durant\nWhat are the most important problems facing humanity today and how should we address them? These\nare, at heart, philosophical questions: they concern\nvalues, and ask how we ought to act. Imperial College\nLondon is one of the world\u2019s leading universities, and\nhence, one of the institutions that\nwe can depend on both to ask, and\nanswer, such questions. Yet, Imperial has no philosophy department,\nin fact, it has no substantial humanities departments at all. When conducting research on science which\naffects humanity, scientists need to\nbe aware of the long-term implications of this research.\nThe university focuses exclusively on science and technology and\nthe culture is one of productively\ncontinuing the march of scientific\nprogress. In addition, strong industry connections naturally focus research efforts on concrete applications. What is often\nlacking is a carefully considered view of what we ought\nto do with the machinery of science. This is apparent\nin the day-to-day lives of many of the researchers and\nstudents at Imperial. For students, the workloads are\nheavy, the deadlines numerous and frequent, and the\nfocusisontrainingtoquicklyproducepracticalresults.\nThis is good training for a role in industry but there is\nless time, under this regime, for reflection on what has\nbeen learned, and less encouragement to step back and\nevaluate one\u2019s long-term goals, or the goals of the society which these students will help to shape. The case\nis similar for researchers, many of whom fall prey to\nthe \u201cpublish or perish\u201d game. Pressures to pump-out as\nmany papers as possible naturally lead to those papers\u2019\nfocusing on safe, incremental results; again, there is less\nroom for reflecting upon the purpose of research, advancing riskier but more important directions, or covering new ground.\nThese issues surrounding the culture of Imperial are,\nat least in part, a consequence of the minimal humanities and a neglect of philosophical thinking. Culture is\ninherently a product of the individuals who make up a\ncommunity. Since the individuals who make up Imperial are, in the vast majority, scientists and engineers,\nthe ideas and norms of the community are technocrat-ic and technosolutionistic. If the Imperial community\nincluded more social scientists and philosophers, this\nwould expand its diversity of thought and broaden the\nrange of ideas under discussion. In particular, more\nphilosophical thinking would lead to an appreciation\nof the big picture questions such as \u201cwhat is our research for?\u201d.\nThis is not to disparage the brilliant scientists working at Imperial, nor their contributions. The latter are\nof very real value to the world and help improve the\nlives of many people (e.g., the work done at Imperial on\npandemic risk and climate change is evidently impor-tant). But the incentives inherent\nin the culture stifle the abilities of\nresearchers to address the questions\nthat we accept as important and\nprevent some questions from being\nasked at all.\nHowever, at Oxford, Cambridge,\nand other universities around the\nworld, there is an emerging community of researchers who explicitly look to ask and answer the big\nquestions facing humanity. At the\nFuture of Humanity Institute, the\nCentre for the Study of Existential\nRisk, the Stanford Existential Risk\nInitiative, and a few other institutes\nin major universities, multi-disciplinary teams of academics bring the tools of mathematics, philosophy, and\nsocial sciences to bear on big-picture questions about\nhumanity and its long-term prospects.\nAmong these communities there is a growing appreciation for the value of considering humanity\u2019s\nlong-term future, and a belief that the present may be\none of the most important time-periods in humanity\u2019s\nlifespan. Fuelled by technological progress, we are in a\nperiod of unprecedented power over the future. Nuclearmissiles,advancedartificialintelligence,andbiologi-calweaponsarejustsomeofthetechnologieshumanity\ncould use to destroy itself. Yet, our technological progress has not been matched by a corresponding growth\nin wisdom. We lack the moral and philosophical maturity to protect ourselves, and our future descendants,\nfrom irremediable mistakes.\nLuckily, it\u2019s not too late! Imperial\u2019s new initiative\n\u201cI-X\u201d is a multidisciplinary environment for research\nacross emerging digital technologies which aims to\n\u201cbuild a better future\u201d. But it has no philosophers! No\nsocial scientists! I-X is an opportunity for Imperial to\nchange its culture, to invite a wider range of voices to\nthe table, and to give genuine philosophical thought to\nthe future of humanity.\nIn short, Imperial College London is undoubtedly\none of the best scientific institutes in the world. But it\nis not enough to continuously turn the wheels of sci-ence; without a greater appreciation for philosophical\nquestions of the value and purpose of research, we run\nthe risk of driving an accelerating car without stopping\nto think about the direction in which we are headed.\nPhilosophy is not dead!\nFrancisRhysWard\nWriter\nPlanet Earth from Space\nPhoto: Unsplash, @nasa\nFRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER 2021\n36 Comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment\nTo answer the important questions, Imperial needs to embrace philosophy\nFUELLED BY\nTECHNOLOGICAL\nPROGRESS,\nWE ARE IN A\nPERIOD OF\nUNPRECEDENTED\nPOWER OVER THE\nFUTURE\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n40 Sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nAs you may have noticed by flicking through this addition of Felix, it is\nthemed around being green. Inspired\nby this, I have decided to do something\nslightly different in the sports section. I\namgoingtorunthroughsomeofthedif-ferent ways in which people commute to\ncollege and how they impact you from\na health point of view as\nwell as the environment.\nThere are several ways\nthat students decide to\nchoose to commute col-lege, these being: walk,\ncycle, bus, tube or Uber.\nFor ease of compari-sons, I will be using the\nassumption that a student lives two miles away\nfrom the South Kensington campus. This allows for the majority of\nFulham, Hammersmith,\nBattersea, and Paddington to be included. From\npersonal experience this\nshould incapsulate most\nImperial students. This\nequates to a cycle commute of approximately fifteen to twenty minutes and a\nwalk of thirty to forty-five minutes. To\ncommute by tube it would be comparable in time taken to the cycle if there are\nnot too many disruptions on the line.\nUber on the other hand could vary from\nonly ten minutes to over half an hour if\nthere is bad traffic or there are no nearby\ndrivers.\nThe cheapest option by far is clearly\nto walk the distance. Cycling comes in\nsecond place as every now and then you\ndo need to maintain your bike if you are\nusing it for commuting, and of course\nthere is the initial bike purchase as well\nas the extras needed for\ncommuting to consider. As\nanyone who lives in London knows busses are marginally cheaper than getting\nthe tube and, unless you are\nsharing one at non-peak\ntimes, uber comes in quite a\ndistant last.\nAs this is the sports section I couldn\u2019t not mention the physical side of the\ncommuting choices. Walking and cycling are clearly\nthe only two that offer any\nreal value for you physical-ly; unless passive aggressive\neye contact at other commuters on public transport\ncounts. To give an idea of\nthe relative effort of these two commuting methods, the number of calories\nburnt for both sit at approximately 150,\nmaking a round trip 300 calories burnt.\nFor a student friendly comparison this is\napproximately one to two pints of beer\ndepending on what you drink. You can\neven use the money saved by not using\nthe other options to buy them! However, it should be pointed out that most\nstudents who cycle or walk into college\nwear the clothes that they will be in for\nthe rest of the day and thus are very un-likelytobeexertingthemselvestoomuch\nto avoid turning up sweaty and dishevelled for their lectures.\nThis somewhat mini-mises the likelihood of\ngetting in any proper\nworkout before or after\na day at college unless\nyou are willing to bring\na change of clothes.\nHowever, the benefit\nof walking or cycling\ninto college are not\npurely the exercise and\nmoney saved. Any student living in the\nuniversity halls in Paddington, Wilson\nhouse, will tell you it is nearly impossible to have a bad day after spending the\nstart of it weaving through hundreds of\ndogs out on their morning walk through\nthe royal parks. Even more so if done on\na beautifully golden autumnal or fresh\nspring day. Slightly less so, I will admit,\nif it\u2019s raining and grey for the tenth consecutive day\u2026 But getting out and seeing\nLondon in the fresh air is something\nImperial students really should do more\nof. We spend the majority of the day sat\nin lecture halls or in our rooms working\naway at our degrees. This is not good for\nour physical or mental health. Without\nmentioning the scary C word, it is worth\npointing out that during pandemics the\nbenefit of commuting in the open air\nare obvious. London public transport\nis pretty grubby at the best of times an-yway.\nNowontotheenvironmentalstuff.It\u2019s\nclear that walking or cycling into univer-sityarethemostenvironmentallyfriend-ly methods for commuting onto campus.\nThe carbon footprint\nfor walking is purely\ndown to what you fuel\nyourself with, while for\ncycling it is marginally\ngreater due to the parts\nwhich need replacing\nevery now and then.\nThe next greenest way\nto commute would be\nvia the tube, this would produce approximately 30g of CO2e per km per person.\nIt is difficult to get accurate and up to\ndate information on London busses, but\nit can be safely assumed that they would\nproduce more CO2e than tubes due to\ntheir stop start nature. Once again, it\u2019s\nno surprise that using Uber would be the\nworst; petrol cars produce roughly 180g\nCO2e and electric cars 60g.\nHopefully this article has made you\nreconsider how you commute to university and perhaps you are now considering walking or cycling into university.\nIt\u2019s better for you and the planet you live\non.\nKonrad Hohendorf Sport Editor\nThe great commute\nWEAVING\nTHROUGH\nHUNDREDS\nOF DOGS\nOUT ON\nTHEIR\nMORNING\nWALK\nTHROUGH\nTHE ROYAL\nPARKS\n\u201c\nIT\u2019S BETTTER\nFOR YOU AND\nTHE PLANET\nYOU LIVE ON\n\u201c\nNot getting hit by cars while cylce commuting is a skill\nHow is the picadilly line still down at South Ken!?\n\n"

This article aims to convince\nyou that Judo gives you everything you\nwant from a martial art!\nYou want to be\nable to really fight\nsomeone, and as\nearly as possible.\nJudo is a grappling\nart, which refers to\nfighting techniques\nthat involve throws,\ntrips, submissions,\nand almost any other movement apart\nfrom strikes. Since all these techniques\nare designed to operate on an actual body, the first time you learn a judo\nthrow will be throwing another human\nbeing, often a resisting one; likewise,\nfor all of Judo\u2019s catalogue of strangles,\nchokes, and holds. There\u2019s simply no way\naround it. It\u2019s a guarantee of genuine\ncombative experience, and it\u2019s tested in\nfree sparring every session.\nYou want to avoid any serious injuries.\nJudo is able to integrate combat so early on because it knows how to prevent\ninjuries. The most fundamental and frequently practiced Judo skill is\na breakfall, where your\nrelaxed limbs are used\nto absorb the impact of\na fall, protecting your\nbones and head. This\nability keeps you safe\nduring sparring and will come in handy\nwhen you take a fall in real life too.\nMany inexperienced people break their\nwrists in minor accidents because they\ndon\u2019t know how to fall properly, but you\nwon\u2019t, because you learned how to fall\nin Judo training!\nYou want to be able to continue practicing when you go back home. Judo is\nnot only one of the most common martial arts worldwide, it\u2019s also an established Olympic sport. No matter where\nyou go, you\u2019re likely to find somewhere\nto train with a qualified coach.\nYou want a reliable measure of your\nprogress in the art. Judo developed a\nbelt-based ranking system that proved\nso useful that\nmany other styles\nadopteditaswell.\nYour belt in Judo\nis an outward indication of what\ntechniques and\nabilities you have\nbeen able to perform in a testing\nenvironment. It\nis a useful tool\nfor sparring part-ners, but also a\nmotivation for a student to continue\nlearning. The pantheon of Judo techniques is large, and this way every student is guided into learning every\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ntechnique in the order which generally\ncomes most naturally.\nYouwanttolearnusefulskillsthatcan\nbeappliedinactualcombat.Don\u2019tletJudo\u2019s interest in avoiding danger fool you\ninto thinking that the art is not useful in\na fight. A dangerous technique in Judo\nrefers to one where you lack control over\nthe outcome. Not only is it desirable in\ncombat to be able to tailor the damage\nyou wreak to the goal at hand, it is also\nimportant to be able to practice your\ntechnique so frequently that you can execute it effortlessly in real life. Take Judo\u2019s ippon seoinage (a commonly used\nshoulder throw),\nwhich you could\npractice 1000 times\nwithin one session with the same\npartner without\ninjury. As a normal\ntechnique this can\nbe utilised to score\nwins in competi-tion, and with just\na minor increase\nin intensity of application it can become a deadly technique to use against\na merciless assailant. It\u2019s a fact that Judo\nis fundamental in many military martial\narts and self-defence systems.\nFinally, you want a bit of flair. It\u2019s all well\nand good being able to fight people, but\nyou want to be able to express your per-sonality, and use moves that stretch your\ncreativity. This is where the Judo jacket\ncomes into play to differentiate Judo\nfrom other wrestling styles. The extra\ngrip allows for extremely unique throws\nand strategies, forcing you to consider\ncomplex combinations and movements.\nIf this brief article has convinced you\nto look around for somewhere to train\nthis beautiful art, look no further! Imperial College is blessed with it\u2019s very own\nJudo club, with a good history of medal\nwins, and coaching connections to the\nBudokwai (Europe\u2019s oldest Judo estab-lishment).

Their contrasting\nvocal territories existing on top of Corey\u2019s weird but\ninfectious beats made every next Injury Reserve track\nmore fun and exciting.\nWhen Groggs died last year, their most recent\nalbum, By The Time I Get To Phoenix, was already\nnearly done, and dropped posthumously in 2021. The\nexperimental sound on the teaser track \u2018Knees\u2019 struck\nme as unexpectedly otherworldly and strange, even\nfor Injury Reserve. Groggs rapping about alcoholism\nand getting joint pains from obesity (\u201cMy knees hurt\nwhen I grow\u201c) over dissonant samples from no other\nthan Black Midi creates an anxiety-inducing, painful\nand depressing vibe that ultimately amounts to a\nhugelyheart-wrenchingtrack,which,inthecontextof\nGroggs\u2019 death, provides an insight into his wretched\nmental state during his final days. To me, the song\nfeels like one of those terrifying\nnightmare-ish dreams where you\u2019re\ntrying to run away from something\nbut your legs consistently keep\nfailing you, leaving you glued to the\npavement to drown in terror.\nI still wasn\u2019t sure whether this\nwas an anomalous track or an over-arching vibe until \u2018Superman That\u2019\ndroppedandIrealisedthesizeofthe\nsonicshiftthebandwasattempting.\nWith Ritchie and Groggs\u2019 vocals\nbeing largely drowned out in an\nabrasive sea of sounds featuring\nBlack Country, New Road samples, the created sense\nof apocalyptic despair comes out utterly chilling.\nRitchie\u2019s auto-tuned \u201cAin\u2019t no saving me or you\u201d, with\nan emphasis on the repeating \u201cor you\u201d, makes the track\nfeel impersonal; more like a generalised existential\nscream, an inevitable end or descent into madness that\nwe are all bound to face, rather than an introspection\non any one person\u2019s mental state in particular. This\nloss of sanity trajectory is even scarier when the track\nis listened to as a follow-up to the opener, \u2018Outside\u2019,\nwhich is beautifully tense and claustrophobic. The\ninclusion of breaths throughout the track, especially\nat the end, over catchy but unsettling Dot samples,\nwith verses like \u201cYou gotta give people enough room to\nhang themself\u201d, generates this feeling of suffocation,\nas if you\u2019re meeting your demise in\na space capsule that is slowly but\nsurely losing all oxygen.\nThis pair of tracks is followed\nby the slightly more harmonic \u2018SS\nSan Francisco\u2019 that nonetheless\ncontinues this visceral vibe, with\nelegant, robotic vocal editing from\nCorey and a scattered palette of\neerie sounds over the main guitar\ntune. The song reads like a scream\nof resistance, a desire to break free.\n\u2018Footwork in a Forest Fire\u2019 then\ncounters this with further hopeless\ndescent, giving us a repeating, sinister sample, which\nmaintains a life of its own, raging independently\nfrom Groggs and Ritchie\u2019s rapping and fading into\ndisquieting emptiness by the end, creating the vibe\nof an unrelenting forest fire. The vocals are mostly\n\u201c\nBY THE TIME I\nGET TO PHOENIX\nMAKES MONEY\nSTORE LOOK\nLIKE AN OLIVIA\nRODRIGO ALBUM\nPhoto: Envato Elements\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nARTS\nLocked in a flat the night before their mothers\nfuneral, three sisters are left the deal with the\ndetritus of their \u2018imagined\u2019 past and present, as\nsnow, nostalgia, and troubled memories rock about;\nIn this slow and comic tale all about grief, we watch\nas the sisters coming to terms with the reality of their\nmother\u2019s death and their catharsis as they handle the\nimpending funeral.\nThat is perhaps the simplest possible distillation of\na synopsis for such a tightly written and layered play.\nSix characters, three sisters, one mother, an affair, a\ndrug user, a repressed soul, and an insipid marriage life!\nThese elements, wry in and out, adding a subtext that,\nthough not always fleshed out properly, results in a play\nthat is as comedic as it is poignant and as touching as\nit is aloof.\n\u201cThe Memory of Water\u201d needs no introduction to\nthose familiar with the London theatrical scene. Written by Shelagh Stephenson in 1996 at the very same\nHampstead Theatre, the play has since gone on to win\nmultiple accolades including the \u201cLaurence Olivier\nAward for Best New Comedy\u201d in 2000 and it\u2019s very\nown movie adaptation (Before You Go) in 2002. However, this shall be the last time I shall draw notice to the\nearlier production, considering the obvious reason that\nmost of us were not born at the time of its release. But\ntrue to form, watching this show in 2021 it is hard to\nrefute that its repute is earned!\nThe latest run, directed by Alice Hamilton and featuring Lucy Black, Laura Rogers, and Carolina Main,\nas the three sisters, Teresa, Mary, and Catherine, is an\ninteresting play for a number of reasons. Dealing with\na subject such as this required deft handling, both in\nscript and in performance; especially one hoping to\nstrike a fine balance between comic intervention and\nportraying true catharsis (which this play tepidly does\nto some extent).\nThe set design is simple, featuring a simple single bed\nroom with very minimal furnishing and a backdrop of\nadequately designed/lit clouds hanging overhead. The\nsupporting cast is equally potent, with Lizzy McInnerny (playing the mother Vi), Kulvinder Ghir (play-ing Frank - Teresa\u2019s better half) and Adam Jones (as\nMary\u2019s married love interest). Together they play wonderful second fiddle to the three sisters, as they wreak\nhavoc within the one room - breaking convention on\nevery single (imagined) instance of British decorum on\ngrieving, with their sordid drinking and insensitivity!\nPerhaps the point of that is - sometimes life gets in the\nway of grieving!\nAnd the play does have its messy \u2018bits\u2019. With three\nsisters around, the play does invest disproportionally\nin Teresa\u2019s catharsis. Her \u2018metamorphosis\u2019, stemming\nfrom her dreamy recountings with her dead mother Vi,\nand liaisons with Mark the night before, are the pivots\naround which the show unarguably revolves. Hence,\nwhen and while the show takes a detour to spotlight\nMary and Catherines\u2019 arc, the play lacks a certain coherence and the indulgence in their storylines comes\nacross as an afterthought of the writer. Perhaps much\nof this is intended too\u2026 but it is tough to imagine what\ncould have been - considering how the play held well\ntogether otherwise.\nHowever, none of this is to discount the acting\nprowess on display! Between McInnerny\u2019s penchant\nmonologues as Vi and Main\u2019s drunken antics (which is\none for the ages); the show is filled with wonderful ex-uberance. Jones and Ghir take centre stage only when\ntheir role demands and linger in the background artfully at other times as the sisters enthrall us with their\nsibling rivalry.\nMemory (imagined or otherwise) and the idea of it\nis what drives the story. Each character recounts a certain version of their childhood \u2013 factual or otherwise.\nAnd they are all unreliable witnesses to their own upbringing (as are we all); believing what they can ration-alise as the cause of their current sorrows.\nThe title derives from a clever use of plot exposition\nwithin the play (no spoilers) about the remarkable trait\nof water to hold its properties upon dilution and thus -The Memory of Water!\nAt one point in the show, Lucy vouches to live with\nthe cold. With her memories - memories of water!\nSnow! Cold! Cold and happy in her solace. I\u2019d say let\nus bid her adieu in this wonderful play that demands a\nwatch!

    "content": "Have you ever thought about how sustainable the\nfilm industry is? While many movies have been\nmade about various natural disasters, perhaps the most\nfrighteningistheimpactthefilmindustryhasonclimate\nchange. This is according to a recent collaborative\nreport by some of the most influential organisations\nin media \u2013 the British Film Institute, Albert (an\norganisation\u2018leadingthechargeagainstclimatechange\u2019\nin the film and TV industries) and Arup (a British\nconsultancy service). Their \u2018Screen New Deal\u2019 suggests\nthat as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,\nstudios should use the opportunity to change the\nway they create films and TV to be more sustainable,\nand continue to inspire audiences in the process.\nAfter carrying out a report on the production of 19\nbig-budget movies, it was estimated that around half\nof the CO2 emissions produced\nin the creation of a predictable\nsuccessful feature, also referred\nto as tentpole, came from fuel\nconsumption. The vast majority\n(70%) of this is due to car\njourneys. In addition to this, the\nusage of mains electricity and\ngas is the second largest cause of\ncarbon emissions. For instance,\ndata analysis for a typical\ntentpole production showed\nits total energy consumption\nroughly equated to the powering of Times Square\nfor 5 days. In addition, the report highlights that for\nthe size of the film industry, it produces \u2018significant\nemissions\u2019 \u2013 more than the manufacturing, clothing\nor hotel industries that contribute a similar amount\nof economic activity. However, perhaps this is due to a\nwider problem - that major corporations are reluctant\nto change from using fossil fuels to renewables. Still,\nmuch can be done to make film production better for\nour planet. The report we\u2019ve looked into is only one\nof a small handful of studies to show the scale of the\nproblem; in order to tackle the film industry\u2019s climate\nproblem more information and real life data is needed.\nTaking all this into consideration it is not surprising\nthen that a large section of the \u2018Screen New Deal\u2019 is\nfocused on providing solutions to reduce transport\nemissions, such as shared transport for crew\nmembers - something which BFI and Arup think\nthat can and should be implemented immediately by\nencouraging individuals in the industry. However\nsome other ideas such as demand prediction, which\nconsists of using transport data to inform decision\nmaking, are relatively new and therefore need more\ndevelopment before they can be implemented.\nAnother novel approach this\nreport puts forward is that of\n\u2018Material Passports\u2019 \u2013 a digital\nidentifier for an object that\nrecordsinformationaboutit,such\nasitsoriginalmaterialsourceand\npast specifications. This could\nallow online stock inventories\nto be created so that materials\ncan easily be reused, as well as\nensuring they are suitable for the\ntask at hand. But even this has\nmany hurdles \u2013 the technology\nhas not been developed yet, and would production\nstudios and manufacturers even be willing to use it if it\nwere?Inorderforthesetypesofframeworkstoactually\nbe successful, the report proposes that the \u2018Material\nPassports\u2019 be enforced by the third-party creators of\nthesematerialsthemselves, achallengebestundertaken\nnowasweshiftawayfromthedarknessofthepandemic.\nBeing inside our own homes every day during\nlockdowns, we often notice ways that furniture can\nbe rearranged, and spaces changed to better fit our\ncurrent need \u2013 and repurposing buildings in this\nway is another suggestion the report provides. The\nfilm and TV industry has the opportunity to use\nbuildings differently now, such as by creating adaptable\nbuildings \u2013 those with only an outer shell and core, no\ninterior walls or divisions \u2013 to allow multiple different\ntypes of sets to be temporarily constructed there.\nWhat about the existing buildings? Those should in\nfact be prioritised, and retrofitted first rather than\nconstructing new buildings from scratch \u2013 a seemingly\nsimple solution, but one that could be difficult to\nimplement if it is not made financially viable to do so.\nAt the end it all comes down to that: is it going to be\nprofitabletomakesustainablechanges?Thereportcalls\nfor international cooperation, and for stakeholders to\n\u2018align incentives\u2019 and agendas to encourage production\ncompanies, especially larger ones, to start making the\nrightdecisionswhenitcomestoclimatechange.Doing\nso will allow smaller studios to follow suit, and allow\nthe flow of content that inspires us both with its artistic\nflourish and the creative sustainability innovation that\nwentintoitsproduction\u2013butthisneedstohappennow.\nSet Zero:\nDeep Dive\nHow do we make the film industry sustainable?\nFRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER 2021\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nFilm Read the reviews on\n2\npage\nFilms on Climate Change\nBy Eva Borras\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 25\nEsha Kamran Film Writer\n\u201c\nTHE VAST MAJORITY\n(70%) OF FUEL\nCONSUMPTION\nIS DUE TO CAR\nJOURNEYS\nWhat\u2019s on?\nBFI: London Film Festival\nFrom the 6th to the 17th October\nMore than 150 features from all around the world\nwill screen to audiences in cinemas across London.\nIf you want to be the first to watch the newest\nreleases of fiction, documentaries, short films or\nanimations, make sure to check it out on their website!\nPhoto credits: Envato Elements\n\n"

This\nplay is firmly a barbed commentary on the experience\nof trans people in the world today and, whilst I would\ncertainly not declare the play an incisive masterpiece,\nthe narrative is thoughtful enough and explores inter-esting, nuanced topics that no-doubt relate to all audiences regardless of their gender identity. The drama unfolds as Rose, trapped in a bathroom and determined\nto save herself, reflects on memories of primary school\nbathrooms; club toilets; and pre-emptive pissing.\nWhen you enter the Bush Theatre you will be greeted by a perplexing set design, one that seems jointly\ninspired by a typical club toilet and a bathroom from\nthe sets of Downton Abbey. A drop of water constantly drips from the \u201cspaghetti junction\u201d of pipes hanging\nabove the stage. It is this set design that brings the production to life. Drawing inspiration from the grunge\naesthetic, the set is extremely dynamic. Lyons plays,\nvery literally, with water throughout; and the dripping,\nrunning, and cascading torrents fill the room with an\nechoey sound, and the platform with a rising line of wa-ter. The soundscape complements the tension brought\nby the unseen characters banging on the bathroom\ndoor; and creates smoky reflected patterns on the walls.\nLyons herself is a delight; dressed to the nines in a\nform-fitting leather boilersuit, she embodies pure positive punk energy and I love it! Okay, there were some\nfleeting awkward moments with the set and a few\nfluffed lines; but there was a total ownership of the role\nand an authentic vibe that would be hard to rival. The\nplay is accessible to everyone, but often trite. More than\na couple of scenes were exercises in grandstanding more\nthan thoughtful portrayal, and they almost began to\nironically reflect the previously condemned dissonance\nbetween the words and actions of so-called queer allies.\nNot to mention, by the end of the performance, the\nmetaphor of water and flooding was so overworked,\nthe whole thing had begun to seem... fake deep.\nAll this being said, I had an amazing time, and I\nwould go again. I appreciate shows that pack a punch\nin a short space of time; and by this measure, Overflow\nis one of the best things I\u2019ve seen this year.
