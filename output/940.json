His torment over whether\nhis life belongs to himself, or those\nwho need him is explored in great\ndepth.\nUnfortunately, the film is also\nabout boxing. PK is a talented\nboxer, and the film found it difficult\nthe reconcile the facts that he lived\nhis life by violence yet was a peaceful man. Perhaps this is a quandary that the film is attempting\nto explore. If this is so then I feel\nthat it has failed. The Power of One\nis a film that stands between two\nstools. It concentrates too much on\nthe drama and emotion to grip as an\naction film and too much on action\nand violence to make it as a drama.\nNone the less, a near miss.\nStef.\n\u2022 Tfie Power of One is on national\nrelease from September 4th Next week at the electric In an unorthodox bid to fill some space, and to gain some free tickets,\nan unscrupulous and panicking hack\ngets worked up over this week's wonderful world of cinema.

This allows\nSir Ronald time to prepare for the\nresponsibilities of the Rectorship of\nImperial College.\nBorn on 2nd November 1934,\nProfessor Sir Ronald Oxburgh is\nmarried with three children. He has\ndistinguished himself on both the\nacademic and administrative sides\nof science and education, being a Geology graduate from University\nCollege, Oxford, and elected to the\nFellowship of the Royal Society in\n1978.\nIn 1978 Professor Oxburgh was\nawarded the Professorship of\nMineralogy and Petrology at\nCambridge University and went on\nto become Head of the Department\nof Earth Sciences in 1980. During\nthe 1980s, Ronald'Oxburgh became\nPresident of Queens College,\nCambridge, and received a visiting\nProfessorship of Cornell University\nin 1986.\nA major change in direction of\nProfessor Oxburgh's career took\nplace in 1988, when he was\nappointed Chief Scientific Advisor\nto the Ministry of Defence. Since\nthen, he has held numerous\nadministrative posts including\nmembership of the Science and\nEngineering Research Council and\nAssessor to the Advisory Board for\nthe Research Councils and the\nAdvisory Council for Science and\nTechnology.\nThe Chairman of the Governors\nSir Frank Cooper, retired Defence\nChief of Staff, said 'Imperial\nCollege is delighted that Sir Ronald\nOxburgh will become the new\nRector'. This view is reflected by\nmembers of the college's academic\nstaff who are optimistic that Sir\nRonald will provide the balance\nbetween academic and financial\nconcerns.\nDFE Appointments Students move into\nJohn Patten, the Secretary of State\nfor Education, has made two\nappointments at the Department for\nEducation (DFE). These changes\nwill take place on 10 August:\nJohn Vereker, Head of the DFE's Further and Higher Education\nCommand, becomes Head of the\nSchool's Command in succession to\nNick Stuart. Stuart is moving to the\nEmployment Department Group\nwhere he will be Deputy Secretary.\nThe Deputy Secretary Head of\nthe Training, Enterprise and\nEducation Directorate in the\nEmployment Department Group,\nRoger Dawe is to be Head of the\nFurther and Higher Education\nCommand in the DFE.\nLoan rates Down\nEurope\nMr Nigel Forman, the Further\nand Higher Education Minister,\nspeaking at the annual conference\nof the UK Council for Overseas\nStudent Affairs, said that Higher\nEducation should become more\ninternational. He continued by\nsaying that he expected the number\nof students coming to the UK to\nstudy to continue to increase,\nparticularly European Community\nstudents. Mr Forman hoped to see\nmore students travelling abroad to\nstudy. He also expressed his desire\nthat student mobility schemes\nwithin the European Community\nwould continue to prosper.\nThe UK is highly involved in the\nErasmus scheme, the EC's foremost student mobility\nprogramme, Imperial College itself\nhas participants in the scheme in\nalmost every department. In\n1990-1991, movement into and out\nof the UK accounted for 40% of all\nthe Erasmus budget.\nThe index ation rate or interest rate\ncharged on student loans for the\ncoming year has been set at 3.9 per\ncent. This is the lowest rate since\nstudent loans began, and represents\na charge of \u00a332 a year on repayment\nany full student loan taken out in\n1992/93.\nIn 1991 when the student loan\nscheme started the Indexation rate\nhas been as high as 9.8%. Because\nthe rate is linked to inflation the\nIndexation rate has been fallen to its\nlowest point this year.\nOn 9th July, a quarter of a million\nstudents had taken out student\nloans, with a total of over \u00a3132\nmillion. This compares with around\n180,000 students who took out\nloans worth \u00a370 million during the\n1992/93.\nThe maximum value of student\nloans taken out this year has also\nbeen announced. For students\nstudying in London next year, they\nare as follows:\nStudents away from home:\nFull Year \u00a3830\nFinal Year \u00a3605\nStudents at Home:\nFull Year \u00a3570\nFinal Year \u00a3415\nBBC create\nEducation Director\nDr Eurfran Jones is to fill the newly\nestablished position of Directorate\nof Education at the BBC.\nDr Jones has been the BBC's Controller of Educational\nBroadcasting since 1987 and she has\nbeen with the BBC since 1959,\nwhen she joined as a general\ntrainee.\nThe BBC's Director General, Sir\nMichael Checkland announced the\nnew Directorate at the Radio\nAcademy Festival in Birmingham at\nthe beginning of July.

Several\nversions are being suggested, but\nas yet, the only available is that\nproduced by the Adam Smith\nInstitute, a well known right wing\norganisation. The report states that\nthe powers of Trade Unions have\nbeen severely curtailed in the past\nten years and, assuming that this\nwas 'no bad thing', uses this\nassumption to suggest the same\nthing occur with respect to student\nunions.\nCommenting that although the\ndocument was only one of many\npossible drafts, Chris Davidson,\nICU President, said 'A lot of\nthings I found interesting and a lot\nof things made my blood boil'. He\nhighlighted two possibilities\nThe name of the Union Snack Bar\nmay be changed to Leonardo's. The proposals were put forward as\npart of the refurbishment of the\nBar taking place over the summer.\nChris Davidson ICU President\nmentioned in the document, and\nhow they affected Imperial College\nUnion. Firstly he feared that the\nUnion's Outlets; the bookstore, bar\nand snack bar would be taken\nfrom Union control, and given\nover to college. This, he said,\nwould be a bad financial move for\nall concerned, declaring his belief\nthat the Union could run the bar\nand snack bar far better.\nThe second question of a possible voluntary membership,\nthe President dismissed,\ncommenting that, given the three\nyears he estimated it would take\nthe government to prepare the\ncharter would be sufficient time to\nprepare. He ended saying, 'I think\nthat with college's help and with\nthe help of industry... we could\nsurvive it'\nsaid that the new-look Bar needed\na name and that Leonardo's was\none of the suggestions. Any further\nsuggestions should be submitted to\nRick Bilby, ICU Deputy President.\nIn August 1991. Sir Norman\nFoster and Partners were appointed\nas consultant architects to Imperial\nCollege. They were asked to\nprepare a plan which would serve\nas a basis for a College Estates\nDevelopment Plan. This Masterplan concentrates on three\nareas of the College: the academic\nsite (bounded by Queensgate.\nExhibition Road. Prince Consort\nRoad and the Science Museum).\nBeit Quadrangle and Princes\nGardens.\nFoster's 'Masterplan' highlights\nproblem areas around College and\nThe summer redevelopment of the\nConcert Hall to include raked\nseating has been put in doubt,\nfollowing concerns about the\nstrength of the sprung floor.\nThe floor in the Concert Hall is\nsupported by steel beams that run\nacross the building. Following\nuncertainty over their strength and\nsize, another survey will have to\nbe taken to establish whether the\nfloor can support the raked\nseating. Consulting engineers,\nrecommended by College, are at\npresent not satisfied that the beams\nputs forward a number of\nproposals which can be built on, to\nprovide a physical environment\nsuitable for Imperial College's needs. The main aims are to give\na more pleasing appearance, with\nmore open spaces and lower\neffective building heights; to\nimprove the pedestrian access by\nrelocating cars below constructed\npedestrian walkways and to utilise\nthe facilities and space available to\nits maximum potential, allowing\nfor expansion of the College in\nfuture years.\nare strong enough.\nThe more detailed survey will\nresult in the Union Concert Hall\nbeing closed for at least a week,\nand will establish whether the\nConcert Hall will be able to hold\nthe seating and the cost of any\nrestructuring that may be needed.\nChris Davidson ICU President\nsaid that there was 'no way that\nthe Concert Hall would be ready\nfor the beginning of term\". Mr\nDavidson hoped that the seating\ncould be installed during the first\nfew weeks of term.\nConcert Hall plans\nunder threat\nUnion Snack Bar\nto change name?\nSabbaticals asked to leave\nThree Imperial College Union\nelected representatives were\nbanned from the University of\nLondon Union (ULU) training\ncourse at Wye College on\nSaturday 18th of July. The ban\nwas enforced because the three,\nChris Davidson (ICU President),\nRick Bilby (ICU Deputy President)\nand Marc Swan (St Mary's President) failed to evacuate the\nbuilding they were staying in\nduring a fire alarm.\nThe UL U training course is\norganised annually for all new\nsenior officers of UL U constituent\ncolleges. Two other ICU officers\nalso attended the course: Dominic\nWilkinson (Honorary Secretary)\nand Jonty Beavan (Felix Editor)\nwho decided to leave with their\ncolleagues.\nAt 4 am on the Saturday morning\nthe fire alarm was activated and\nthe building evacuated. Following\na roll call, it was found that Chris\nDavidson. Rick Bilby, Marc Swan\nand Tarn Lamb (last year'sULU Vice President, finance and\nWelfare), were still in the building.\nWhen the Fire Brigade arrived to\nsearch the building, they found the\nmissing sabbaticals asleep in their\nrooms.\nThe following morning, Kate\nSteele, UL U Research and\nTraining Manager, told Chris\nDavidson, Rick Bilby and Marc\nSwan, that they had to leave the\nWye College accommodation. The\nWarden of the accommodation,\nMrs Simmons, later stated that\n'anyone who failed to leave the\nbuilding for a fire alarm was asked\nto leave.' The four sabbaticals had\nagreed earlier that morning that if\none of them were banned they\nwould all leave. This they\npromptly did.\nDuring the night damage had also\noccurred in the Hall of residence.\nMrs Simmons, commented that\nduring the evening a condom\nmachine and a table had been\nbroken. Also a toilet roll had been\nforced into a tampon incinerator\nwhich had subsequently triggered\nthe fire alarms.\nMrs Simmons continued that 'ULU\ncourses would not be held at Wye\nCollege again'. Mark Samuals\n(ULU President) did not comment\non this but emphasised that 'IC\nsabbaticals have not been banned\nfrom future courses' and that he\npersonally found the course\n'excellent'.\nCommenting earlier this week,\nChris Davidson said that he was a very 'heavy sleeper'. However,\nother course delegates reported\nthat the alarm was 'bloody loud'.\nThe course cost IC Union \u00a3 9 0 tor\neach sabbatical. Last year all of\nthe Union office sabbaticals went\non the course. Zoe Hellinger,\noutgoing ICU President who went\non the course last year, said that 'it\nwas very useful for networking'.\nKate Steele and Mrs Simmons\ncould not be reached yesterday to\nexplain why Tarn Lamb, who also\nfailed to leave the building during\nthe fire alarm, was not asked to\nleave the course.\n\u2022 Felix is produced for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union\n^ i.

Bill and Stan, two\nstudents on a tour of America, get\nVinny. Vinny (Joe Pesci) hasn't actually taken a case to court\nbefore. In fact he's only been in the\nbusiness for six weeks, but he's Bill's cousin and will take the case\nfor free.\nThe case against Bill and Stan is\nfrighteningly secure. After a shooting in a grocery store, two\nboys who match Bill and Stan's description are seen racing off in a car that matches theirs perfectly.\nOnly the murder weapon is missing,\nbut that won't stop Trotter (Lane\nSmith), the prosecuting attorney\nfrom sending the two boys to the\nchair.\nVinny's struggle with courtroom\nprocedures and his quest to get a decent night's sleep is very funny\nand captivating. Good fun.\nToby Jones\n\u2022 My Cousin Vinny is out now on\ngeneral release.\nBeauty and the Beast\nOne does not expect depth in an\nanimated Disney film, and\nfollowing the tenet that to be\nforewarned is to be forearmed, I managed to expect nothing but\nschmaltzy tears and predictable\nmorals, and thus I did enjoy it. The\nfilm conforms to all the Disney\nformulae - facile and effective\ncharacter is tion, immediately\nplacing the Goodies, the Baddies,\nthe Amusing Incidental Characters\nand the Tragic Figure. All set in an\nover-the-top rustic Bavarian\ncountryside. The expected and\nappeal ingly slapdash visual humour\nis there as well as the subtler jokes\nfor the grownups like, for instance,\nthe rather bittersweet advice given\nto the wooing Beast of the title on\nhow to win a woman; 'give her\nthings like flowers, chocolates,\npromises you don't intend to\nkeep....'\nA truly stunning piece of\nanimation is a computer-generated\nswoop around a circular ballroom\nduring a particularly smooch y bit of\nromanticism. If you want a superficially amusing and attractive\nway to spend some time, this is for\nyou. We all know what Disney\nfilms are like - don't convince\nyourself of anything different and\nyou will enjoy this film.

So why do I but these my work clothes..\nthink it's crap? Well, here goes.\nSomehow, though I didn't think\nit such a hard task, the makers of\nthis film did not manage to\ncharacterize, explore or give any\nemotive impact to the three lead\ncharacters. The token storyline jolts\nalong with dod gy motivations for all\nthree. Batman seemed rather\ninsignificant against Catwoman's' S+M' style retribution for her\npast life of plainness, drudgery and\noppression. Why, I ask myself, do\nthey bother getting an actor for the\npart of Penguin, let alone a 'name'?\nDanny DeVito was so plastic is ed and distorted in his part that it\nwould be near impossible for you\nto get a taste of his talent. The script\nwas tacky and banal, The Cat;'Life's a bitch, now so am I'. Pass\nthe sick bag says I. How can so\nmuch money be spent on a film with\nthe final cut having such bad sound\nquality?

    "content": "'eat ure s31st July1992 I stepped out from the gaudy auto\nrickshaw onto the steps of Delhi\nInter State Bus Terminal. The\nmidday sun filtered down through\nthe dusty sky and played rather\ngingerly over the abrupt grey angles\nof the station building. It towered\nabove me, an enthusiastically huge\npiece of concrete cubism, around\nwhich people, rickshaws and cows\nswirled in an endless tumbling sea\nof colour and noise.\nThe rickshaw driver thoughtfully\nkicked my bags out onto the floor\nwhere they landed with a satisfying ly dusty 'wu mph'. He\nthen proceeded to ask for twice the\nfare that we had agreed back at my\nhotel. When I protested he\nexplained that this was an extra\ncharge because we had stopped\nalong the way. I was taken aback.\nThe only reason we had stopped\nwas because he ran somebody over.\nThe driver seemed convinced that\nI should pay more for this extra\nservice despite the fact that, through\nno fault of his own, an old man\nsomewhere between Connaught\nPlace and New Delhi now bore an\nindelible impression of the front of\nour auto rickshaw on his buttocks.\nI gave him the original fare and\nwalked off with my bags, leaving\nhim yelling on the steps.\nThe inside of the bus terminal\nwas much less crowded than\noutside. Despite the cavernous\ninterior there was something about\nit that suggested people were an\nunwelcome intrusion.\nThe walls were lined with little\nticket booths where bored ticket\nsellers sat drinking tea. A few blue\nplastic chairs were scattered over\nthe dusty concrete floor as a kind\nof absent minded concession to the\nfact that this building was actually\nmeant to be used by human beings.\nI followed the signs down a curling concrete ramp to the buses\nthemselves. The main concourse\nwas crowded with food stalls. I The man...next\nto me threw up\nquite matter of\nfact ly. bought some samos as in a little\ndisposable bowl made from pressed\nleaves and elbowed my way\ntowards the buses.\nMy bus was waiting with the\nengine running. It was a relaxing\nsky blue colour with several deep\nsilver wheals running down the left\nhand side. The word 'luxury' had\nbeen painted in red above the\nwindscreen.\nFelix940 The driver's mate painstakingly\nstowed my luggage in the boot and\ngave me a little red tab so that I could reclaim it at the end of my\njourney.\nI walked around the side of the\nbus to board and had just reached\nup to turn the door handle when the\ndoor whipped open by itself. A thin\nman in a tight brown suit fell\nheavily out of the bus and landed\non his back in front of me. For a second we looked at each other but\nbefore I could say or do anything\nhe leapt up, brushed himself down\nand climbed back onto the bus.\nI hesitated momentarily then\nfollowed him up the steps. Once\ninside I found myself in almost\ncomplete darkness. The only\nillumination came from the\nfractionally open door. The drivers\ncompartment at the front was\npartitioned off and all of the\nwindows were heavily curtained.\nWhen I had eventually groped my\nway to my seat I realised that the\ncurtains had also been securely\nscrewed to the window frames.\nI sat in the dark and felt the gentle\nthrob of the engine under my feet.\nGradually the bus filled up and I counted at least seven people walk\ndown the aisle and disappear into\nthe driver's compartment. Another\nfive minutes passed and I heard the\ndrivers door slam shut. He revved\nthe engine and we reversed out\nfrom our parking bay and nosed\ninto the Delhi afternoon traffic.\nBy the time we had eventually\nescaped the grasping clutches of\nDelhi's road system and were in\nopen country I had begun to nod off\nin the darkness and was looking\nforward to a peaceful sleep for the\nnext four hours. Sadly it was not to\nbe.\nThe drivers compartment door\nflapped open intermittently and\ninside I could see compact mass of\npeople engaged in what appeared to\nbe a party. A crate of beer was\npartially visible behind the door\nwhich the little fat man abruptly\ndisappeared through when he had\nfinished his fiddling. It slammed\nand locked behind him and the\nstrange bacchanalian world which\nseemed to have developed in the\ndriver's cab disappeared from view.\nWith a flash it dawned on me\nwhat he had been doing. The\nrealisation ran through me\naccompanied by a wave of cold\nsweat. I considered hurling myself\nout into the traffic to forestall the\ninevitable torture. I was on a video\nbus.\nThe two words 'video bus' are\nenough to instil at least a sense of\nforeboding into even the most\nhardened traveller on the sub\ncontinent. The main reason for this\nis that all Indian stereos and videos\ncan seemingly only be played at\nmaximum volume and maximum\nFrom Kathmandu to Madras, India holds no more hideous experience.\nAn innocent IC student is caught up the subcontinent's most horrific\nnightmare.

Prolonged\nexposure can cause deafness,\nbleeding from the ears and, on very\nlong journeys, I am sure death is a possibility, if not a merciful release.\nI searched frantically through my\nday pack for my ear plugs until I remembered wrapping them up in\nmy socks which were neatly packed\naway in the boot. I sat back and\nresigned myself to my fate.\nThe screen blinked alive and the\nfilm began. I thanked the powers\nabove that the speaker over my seat\nwasn't working but my attention\nwas drawn ir resist ably towards the\nscreen.\nThe film was in Hindi but despite\nmy total lack of knowledge of the\nlanguage it was pretty obvious that\nthe story was set somewhere deep\nin the 1970s. A handsome Indian college\nstudent (whose name could only\nhave been the Hindi equivalent of\nKevin) sporting a wonderful\npolyester safari suit falls in love\nwith a beautiful Indian girl in blue\nhot pants. They begin the perfect\nromance. There follows much\nrunning about in the snow, walking\nhand in hand through delightful\nforest glades and disappearing into\ngolden sunsets in a fluster of Cuban\nheels and cheesecloth shirts.\nThey get married and appear to\nhave the perfect marriage as well\nand still have plenty of time to run\nabout in the snow etc. Eventually\nthough for some reason things turn\nsour and the wife returns to her\nparents and tries to shoot herself.\nHer father grabs the gun and she\ncollapses into a faint.\nThe next scene shows her parents\nsitting facing a doctor in his\nsurgery. He is wearing a white coat\nand has a stethoscope in his ears for\nno apparent reason. He removes it\nfor dramatic effect and the music\nmoves up a gear. He gives them\nsome apparently shocking news and\nthere follows several minutes of\nrapid close ups of the parents\nshocked faces. I think their daughter\nwas pregnant.\nA little later Kevin pays them a visit to apologise and ask for his\nwife back as he has no one to iron\nhis flared trousers. He is told that\nshe is dead. Extremely dramatic\nmusic fills the bus and we are\ntreated to a bonanza of close ups of\nshocked faces, some of which don't appear to have anything to do with\nthe film.\nKevin goes mad and runs away.\nTime passes and we see him\nwandering about with a dirty beard\nand wearing tattered flares and a grubby old trench coat.\nMore passing years are signified\nby all of the actors, even the\nchildren, having grey streaks in\ntheir hair and eventually Kevin goes\n'eat ure s31st July1992 back home. He gets severely beaten\nup by the new owner of his house\nwho is understandably distressed at\nfinding a tramp in his living room.\nAfter a fashion he is recognised\nand told that his wife didn't really\ndie. The ensuing flood of dramatic\nmusic was too much. The man\nsitting next to me threw up quite\nmatter of fact ly into a paper bag and\nThe music\ntranscends\nhuman capacity\nfor drama.\ncarried on watching.\nThe camera goes mad and\ndramatically zooms in on\neverything, anguished faces, old\nblack and white wedding photos,\nbookshelves, tables and the doctor\ntaking the stethoscope out of his\nears.\nIt transpires that his wife had a daughter by him and this daughter\nis coincidentally getting married\nthat very night.\nWe cut to an Indian wedding\nscene of bright lights and dancing\npeople. Kevin is hiding in the\nbushes and catches a glimpse of his\nwife. The music by now had got so\ndramatic that the woman across the\naisle from me was crying.\nSuddenly fire breaks out in the\nwedding tents and people run\naround in panic. Kevin sees his wife\nabout to be flattened by a falling\nbeam and makes the supreme\nsacrifice of pushing her out of the\nway and getting flattened himself.\nThe fires are extinguished and the\nwedding guests gather in a hushed\ncircle around the motionless Kevin.\nHis eyes half open and it is clear that\nhe is on his last legs. In that instant\nhis wife recognises him and gasps\nin astonishment. Kevin reaches\ntowards her with imploring fingers\nand with his dying breath says\nsomething so moving that the\naccompanying music transcends the\nhuman capacity for drama. As\nKevin's limp arm falls to the\nground, the film ends.\nThe man sitting next to me looked\nacross.\n'You liked the film?'\nUncertain of what to say I said\n'Yes. it was very good.\"\nHe didn't have time to reply\nbefore he was forced to turn back\nto his sick bag and throw up again.\nThe rest of the journey was rather\nan anticlimax. In fact, the rest of my\nlife probably will be.\nPage6 Page7 "

    "content": "Features\nFelix94031 st July1992 Southern Ireland is again in turmoil, after the rapist of a17 year old\ngirl escapes punishment. Declan Curry reports on the victims story.\nDoes Rape really pay?\nIn the early hours of 1st January,\n1992, Lavinia Kerwick was raped.\nHer rapist was her boyfriend,\nWilliam Conry. Both were 17 years\nold. and Conry was walking\nLavinia home after a New Year's Eve disco. In July, Conry pleaded\nguilty to rape at Dublin's Central\nCriminal Court. He was released by\nthe judge, who imposed a one year\nsuspended sentence.\nLavinia Kerwick had been\ndescribed as a 'happy go lucky'\nteenager. In employment since\nleaving school, she was interested\nin sport, and excelled in martial\narts. A judo certificate hangs from\na wall in her house. T was right up\nto one level below the black belt,'\nshe says. She also had a 'steady'\nboyfriend. She and William Conry\nhad been going out together for five\nmonths before he raped her.\nShe met Conry at the disco, and\nhe insisted on walking her home\nafterwards. At the trial, defense\ncounsel said that Conry, who had\nbeen drinking, took Kerwick past a disused mill beside the River Nore\nin County Kilkenny. Conry then\nplaced his jacket on the ground for\nwhat counsel called a 'good court',\nthat is physical intercourse. Conry\nthen went on to rape Kerwick,\ndisregarding her screams.\nAfter the crime, Lavinia went to\nvisit a doctor. 'When she examined\nme, she found bruises everywhere,\non my back, on my face, on my\nprivate parts,' Lavinia says. She\nalso says that Conry tried to\ndissuade her from reporting the\ncrime. Conry beat her, and said he\nwanted rights to see the baby if she\nbecame pregnant as a result of the\nrape. Conry then changed his mind,\nand said he wanted Lavinia to go to\nEngland for an abortion.\n'My life was totally turned upside\ndown.' Lavinia says. 'On New\nYear's Eve, I lost my virginity and\neverything else that I valued.'\nSince she was raped, Lavinia\nKerwick lost three and a half stone\nin weight. She has difficulty\nsleeping, and when she does sleep\nshe has recurring nightmares about\nher experiences. 'My life was\nshattered to pieces,' she said. T am\nstill a prisoner in my own house\nShe has not gone outside the door\nof her home since January. 'When\nI had to go to the doctor the other\nday, a ban garda (Irish woman\npolice constable) had to come and\ncollect me and bring me home\nafterwards.'\nT took an overdose at the end of\nJanuary. I just felt that nothing was\ngoing to be done and I just felt so\ndirty and so guilty that I just\ncouldn't go on with life anymore.\nHe (Conry) said that if I brought the\ncase to court, he would walk free.'\nLocal gardai (Irish police)\npredicted that Conry 'would be put\naway for 10 to 15 years.' A police\nsuperintendent, shocked by the\ncase, visited Lavinia at home and\nsaid Conry would be jailed for at\nleast 15 years, possibly 20. 'The\nthing that kept me going during the\nlast seven months was the\nknowledge that he would be\nsentenced to jail', she said.\nThe case came to court on 15th July. Conry was represented by\ndefense counsel Michael\nMcDowell. Lavinia Kerwick was\nrepresented by the state, with\nMichael Feehan prosecuting.\nSergeant John Tuohy, of\nKilkenny Gardai, told Mr Feehan\nthat Lavinia Kerwick's mother\ncomplained to the Gardai about the\nrape. Sergeant Tuohy then visited\nConry, who readily admitted the\nrape and made a statement.\nThe sergeant described Conry, an\napprentice carpenter, as a member\nof a very respectable farming\nfamily. He added that Conry's 'only\nfault was that he had been drinking\ntoo much at times.'\nThe rapist's father told the court\nthat he and his family were\n'shocked and horrified' by what had\nhappened. The defense counsel, Mr\nMcDowell, pleaded for 'as much\nmercy as the law allows,' and\napologised on Conry's behalf, for\nan 'atrocious, in ex cus i ble and\nunjustified attack.' Mr McDowell\nsaid that Conry had 'given in to his\nstrong sexual impulse without any\nforethought. He knew almost\nimmediately he had done her a very\ngrave wrong.'\nIronically, Mr McDowell\ndescribed the rapist in the same\nterms as Lavinia Kerwick had\nearlier been described, as a 'happy\ngo lucky' teenager. Mr McDowell\nsaid that Conry was an immature 17\nyear old at the time of the offence.\n'He had been scars ely more than a boy'.\nIn summing up, the judge, Mr Feargus Flood, told Conry that he\nwas giving him a chance as 'a human being', and was adjourning\nsentence for one year. The judge\nwarned Conry that if he\ntransgressed in any way, even by\n'simple drunkenness' or disorderly\nbehaviour, Conry would be jailed\nfor 10 years.\nConry was also ordered to report\nregularly to the probation service\nand to abide by the directions of his\npsychiatrist. Conry was warned to\nkeep away from Lavinia Kerwick,\nand then walked free from court.\nLavinia Kerwick was in court\nthroughout the hearing, flanked by\nher mother and a police officer.\nDuring the judge's summing up,\nshe broke d down and wept bitterly.\nShe was assisted from the court, and\nrepeatedly screamed, 'he got away\nwith it, he got away with it.' The\nfollowing day, she revealed her\nidentity and told the Irish nation of\nher story on a radio phone-in\nprogramme.\nT went public to try and get some\njustice for myself and to make sure\nthat something like this never\nhappens again,' she said after the\nprogramme. T felt that after coming\nso far and being let down by the\nwhole justice system that I should\nnever have reported it in the first\nplace. If one of my friends was\nraped, I would say she would be\nwasting her time reporting it. The\nman who raped her could easily get\naway.'\nPage5 "

I personally have spent\nmost of my time during the last\nthree weeks familia rising myself\nwith as many aspects of the job as\npossible. This has included meeting\nmost of the college staff I will be\nliaising with, as well as some of the\ngovernors. We have also had some\nformal training sessions involving\nteam-building exercises and the\nlike.\nI have already begun negotiations\nwith regard to the issue of Union\ncards next term. Initially, it was\nproposed to combine Union and\nlibrary cards with the new college\nsecurity pass. After discussions\nwith Keith Reynolds, Head of\nSecurity, Peter Mee, the Registrar\nand other interested parties this was\ndeemed unfeasible. I shall\nendeavour to explain the reason.\nThe current Union card includes a grid of punch able spaces numbered\nl to 6 so Union officials may punch\na given number and thereby know\nwhether the holder has voted in an\nelection or received a particular\nfreebie. The security pass lasts the\nduration of the student's stay at\nCollege. The proposed combined\ncard would therefore require up to\ntwenty-four holes. This would leave\nthe final year student with a card\nresembling something like a colander! To resolve this problem,\nI shall be liaising with Keith\nReynolds throughout the year and\nI hope to have an electronic\n'punching' system ready for the\n1993 intake.\nRemember\u2014the Union office is\nopen throughout the summer, so\ndon't hesitate to pop in if you think\nwe can help you with anything!\nSee you next time.\nRick.\nSmall ads\n\u2022 ACCOMMODATION WANTED: Looking for\nsomewhere to live?

Pictured\nabove are the plans for the new Snack Bar. The Ents. Lxjunge is being redesigned to look 'more like a night\nclub' in the words of incoming Deputy President Rick Bilby.\nDominic's Fairytale\nOnce upon a time there was a bar.\nNow not many people seemed to\nknow about it and it didn't have\nmany friends but nonetheless it was\nquite a happy little thing, in its own\nshoe-box y sort of a way.\nBut even so the bar couldn't help\nfeeling a little bit sad and left out\nand lonely in its little leafy corner.\nYou see, the bar was funny looking.\nThis wasn't the bar's fault, oh no,\nit just seemed to have grown up that\nway.\nCruel, nasty, unkind boys and\ngirls who didn't understand about\nBars would come up to it and laugh\nand say wicked things.\n'You've only got aw id gy little\nserving area', they would say.\n'You're a real rectangle'.\n'Eurgh, just look at the state of\nyour yucky blue tables and chairs'.\nYou can imagine how unwanted\nand dejected the bar felt. People\nonly seemed to be interested in it\nwhen they could bump into its\nfurniture or dance around in its\nfriend the disco until two o 'clock in\nthe morning.\nThen one day some kind, special\npeople who could see beyond the\nbar's ugly exterior into its warm\nand loving heart said to it,' Here's lots of money, go and get yourself\na serious face-lift, because all the\nclever bars know that if you're not\nattractive, curvaceous and desirable\nthen no-one will want to use you'.\nNow the bar knew that deep\ndown it was special anyway but\ncould see from reading its bar\nmagazines that if it didn't look good\nit would never be really popular.\nSad, but that's a consumer is t society\nfor you.\nSo in the end, after several weeks\nwork with a chisel and a screwdriver when nobody was\nlooking, the Bar transformed itself\nfrom a dull stone into a shining\njewel and was really popular and\neverything else...\nThis isn'ta complete fairytale\nbecause over the next few weeks the\nUnion Lounge Bar is about to be\ntransformed with the installation of\na new 70 foot bar, a raised dais, an\nextended serving area etc that will\nmake the bar as it is,\nun recognisable. In conjunction with a full weekly\nUnion events programme and a general publicity campaign to\nincrease its awareness, the Students'\nUnion will hopefully become the\ncentre of student social life within\nImperial as it rightfully should be.\nIf anyone has any comments or\nsuggestions about the bar, events or\nanything else then please come and\nsee me. You will be made all the\nmore welcome if you also have\nsome cigarettes with you.\nTatty bye.\nDominic.\nPage 4\n\n"

Mr Lipton\nrefused to comment to i CNN on\nthe reports that shares in Stanhope\nwere used as security by O&Y to\nguarantee the repayment of O&Y' s loans.\nThe share dealing was first\nreported in the Independent on\nSunday on the 5th July. According\nto business correspondent, Gail\nCounsel, Olympia and York\npurchased 32.6% of Stanhope's shares in 1988, at a cost of \u00a3137\nmillion. When Olympia & York\nfiled for bankruptcy in May of this\nyear, these shares only had a projected value of \u00a39.2 million.\nThe Independent also reported that\nStanhope's bankers are looking at\npossible ways of restructuring the\ncompany's finances and that\nStanhope may face 'concerted\naction' from the banks.\nMr Lipton was also one of several\ngovernors considering the purchase\nof Furse House, on Queen's Gate\nTerrace, a property owned by\nStanhope Properties. /CNN has\nlearned that the College has\ndecided not to purchase the former\nMinistry of Defense Hostel, which\ncould have housed up to 200\nstudents. The plan to purchase\nFurse House has been seen to be\nclosely linked to the soon to be\nretiring Rector, Sir Eric Ash.\nSpeaking to i CNN in June, Sir\nEric said that he 'would give his\nParty. The first draft of the report,\npublished last term, was roundly\ncriticised, with several pages of\ncorrections and errata submitted in\nresponse. In particular the response\nof wardens to the report angered\nthe Rector, who said that he was\n'cold with fury'. The rector has\nhimself caused consternation with\nhis letter to Felix in issue 939,\ndenying that he used that particular\nphrase. Sir Eric's denial has been\nflatly contradicted by three\nindependent sources, who told\ni CNN that they heard the Rector\nuse this phrase when referring to\nthe warden's response to the\nWorking Party report. The Rector\nis now believed to be restoring\nrelations with College Managing\nDirector, Angus Fraser, and\nEstates Director, Gordon Marshall.\nThe relationship between these\nthree senior College administrators\nwas damaged by the recent\nmanagement rows over the\nWorking Party report, and the\nplans to buy Furse House,\nright arm' to buy the hostel,\nthough he did add that the deficit\non the Estates account could not\nbe extended beyond its current two\nmillion pound level. Sir Eric\nrecently hosted a reception for\ncollege alumni, who were being\ntargeted for donations towards the\ncost of the property. Estates\nsources said that the College\nwould have had to have raised\nthree million pounds to pay for the\nhostel.\nThe decision not to buy Furse\nHouse has given the Estates\nDivision time to further\ncontemplate the report from the\nResidences Strategy Working\nFire in Clayponds\nThe Creda washing machine that caught fire in Clayponds.\nEvery house in the estate has the benefit of one.\nA fire broke out in a washing\nmachine in Imperial College's Clayponds estate at the end of\nterm.

As there are no\ninternal phones in Clayponds the\nfire brigade had to be called from\na nearby phone box.

    "content": "o Editorial\nAs Felix Editor, it is traditional to\nspend most of my time criticising\nothers. In particular, the antics of\nmy fellow sabbaticals come under\nthe most severe criticism.\nUnfortunately this issue of Felix\nwill come to you with the help of\nthe Union office laser printer, so it\nwould be a little hypocritical to be\ntoo unpleasant.\nEven so, this rather delayed copy\nof Felix contains some information\nthat the Union Office would rather\nit didn't. Here, I believe lies the\ntraditional antagonism between\nFelix and the Union. We both\nrepresent students, but in such a way that'our goals often collide.\nI really believe that this year is\ndifferent. Having been on more\nmanagement and training courses\nwith the Union s a bbs, than it is\nright for a human to endure, my\nattitude to the Union Office has\nchanged. I now regard 'them\nupstairs' as comrades in arms in a harsh world were the future of\nstudent union is under threat. In\nreturn, those high up in the Union\nalso have a respect for, what I do\nand the right 1 have to do it,\nwithout any interference.\nUnfortunately this newfound spirit\nof cooperation has a down side.\nThe events at Wye College during\nthe UL U training, put me in the\nposition of reporting events, that\ncriticised people, I had been trying\nto build a working relationship\nwith. Upon showing reluctance to\nspread these revelations in 6ft high\nletters across the front page of\nFelix, my position was put under\nextreme pressure and I haven't even started the job yet!\nToday, Adam Harrington last years\nFelix Editor will be leaving for the\nrest of the world. All the Office\nwish him the best of luck for the\nhowever much of his life he has\nleft. He warned me about this job,\nbut I didn't listen, may he be left\nin a corner to cackle in peace.\nThis issue of Felix was brought to\nStream of Consciousness\nLard. What does lard suggest to\nyou? As one half of the half-fat to\nflour relationship of Shortcrust\nPastry, lard is at the hub of the\nU.K.' s pie construction activities,\nbut to such figures as Harry\nEnfield, Vic Reeves and large\nfemale fu nster, Jo Brand, lard is\nthe last cornerstone of the great\nbritish comedy icon.\nIt's been a long time since Ben\nElton's humour was funny,\ndepending as it did on a tongue-in-cheek appraisal of the 70's sitcom,\nwith lots of 'whoops! Mrs\nScatology, my underpants have\nfallen in the vicar's tea', and other\nsuch gems. Besides, he'd always\ncloak his humour with some\n'serious message', which, for a comedian, is an entirely stupid\nthing to do. Great idea, Ben, poke\nfun at the human condition, say\n'our expectations are too high; let's be honest', and make yourself\nredundant in the process. What a star. Even his great student\nAnarcho-Icons 'the Young Ones',\nand the rubbery, histrionic\nhistories of 'Blackadder' relied too\nmuch on the 'spoof, you see. Noone laughs at the toilet anymore,\nthe fart has wafted away with a whimper, and bottoms have lost\ntheir cheekiness. There's still much\nmirth in the willy, but this won't Felix 9 4 0\nyou by Shiva the god of general\nunder handedness and bad luck. A combination of circumstances has\nmeant that everything that could\ngo wrong, has done. Thanks to all\nthe wonderful people below, who\nhave brought this issue into the\nworld kicking and screaming. I sincerely thank all of them for\nputting up with my lack of\nknowledge, short temper and\nd is organisation. pinion\n31st July1992 Credits Adam, James, Beccy, Chris,\nEmma, Rose and Andy (Have a good holiday!), Steve N, Jeremy,\nChris Riley (sorry you didn't quite\nmake it!), Stefff, David, Toby,\nCatherine, Sam, Mel, Declan\nCurry Ace Reporter, Tricky Dicky,\nChris Davidson, Dom and last but\nnot least, the wonderful typesetting\nmachine, for generally making my\nlife more interesting. May it be\ndropped from a very great height\non to extremely bumpy ground.\nlast indefinitely. Roll on the\nRestoration revival, await and\napplaud the Absurd. Happy days\nare here again!\nBut for lard, the future looks\nbleak; in five years' time, humour\ntheorists will be quipping over\ntheir Cabernet Sauvignon; 'I can't believe that huge congealed lumps\nof animal fat brought so much\npleasure, let alone, be regarded as\nthe apex of La Comedie Surreal.\nPass the spl iff, Tarquin'. Lard is\nthe epitome of all that is thick, fat,\ndour and tasteless, and thus\nsymbolises the most loathsome\nelements of humanity, or every\none's favourite joke figure. Plus.\nThe next\nissue of\nFelix will\ncome out on\nthe 3rd of\nSeptember.\nYour\ncontribution\ngratefully\naccepted.\nwhen pushed through strategically-positioned holes in your cereal\npacket, it looks like that dreadful\nkid's toy with the plastic in e hair\nthat you pushed to make it grow.\nThere will always be those people\nwho will suggest that it's humour\nexists in the fact that it is\ncompletely unfunny, but they're\nwan kers, and not worth the time of\nday, which on our New Lard\nClock is accurate at least twice a day. However, the day will come\nwhen lard is a mere substance to\nbe utilised for great big fry-ups\nand general food preparation, and\nI for one will mourn it's passing;\nwhile it's still with us, let's celebrate lard!\nBeit\nBack\nAnother Union year comes to an\nend. another starts. This year's sabbaticals have spent July winding\ndown. Supposedly they have been\ntraining up their successors in how\nto do their jobs. Potentially a difficult task, when some of them\nonly found out quite recently what\nthey were supposed to be doing.\nZoe, one of this year's more\nvisible sabbaticals is on her new\nwhite bike and off to find a job.\nAdam, leaves the Felix Office for\nthe last time and heads off around\nthe world. Meanwhile Steve and\nJonathan return to the real world\nwhere they carry on with their\ndegrees.\nSo what of next years sabbaticals?\nThey have already got off to an\nimpressive start. Their UL U training at Wye college lasted less\nthan 24 hours before they were\nkicked out. Why? Well, after a free\nbar all Friday evening the drinking\nand singing continued late into the\nnight. The high spirits continued,\nwith doors being kicked and people\nwoken up until 2am when the\nshina nig an s finally ended.\nBy 4ama smouldering toilet roll\nin the tampon incinerator had set off\nthe fire alarms, which in their\nalcohol induced sleep, several of\nour sabbaticals slept through. The\nwarden decided that she didn't want\npeople who slept through fire\nalarms in the hall, and they were\nasked to leave.\nThe ensuing cover up was quite\nimpressive. The basic skills of team\nbuilding, networking and media\ncommunication interfacing, that the\ncourse was going to teach, seemed\nto have already been learnt by all\nthe sabbaticals. When they next\nappeared in the Union Bar, the\ngeneral 'no comment' that might be\nused to cover these situations was\nreplaced with 'sorry its a personnel\nmatter and I can't talk about it'. It\ntook over a week before the wall\nstarted to crumble, and even then\nit remained an obstacle.\nHave the incoming sabbaticals\nlearnt anything from this\nunfortunate incident? Hopefully\nyes. ICU needs a year of strong\nleadership coupled with all the\nstudent officers and staff working\nas a team. At the moment they seem\nto be providing a lot of the former,\nand only a little of the latter, but\nadmittedly this is hard to build over\nthe summer. The fact that there are\nfresh ideas coming out of the Union\nOffice is good, but these ideas\nshould be discussed, rather than\nbeing implemented over the\nsummer. But at least there are new\nideas.\nIt seems as though the four\nsabbaticals are working well\ntogether, although they have very\ndifferent responsibilities and duties.\nHopefully this will continue and we\nwill have a storming year.\nViews expressed in this article are not necessarily\nshared or supported by the\neditorial staff of Felix or\nImperial College Union.

On the other hand, the two\nother leads, Ben Caplan, (amoral ising gambler), and Nicole\nKingston, (the Salvation Army\nSergeant), did not seem at ease with\ntheir roles to the same degree.\nThe effort put in by the cast as a whole paid off tremendously, with\nthe ensemble pieces being the high-point of most scenes.

Let\nme explain.\nThe story centres around a carnival celebrating the\nquin centenary of Columbus'\nvoyage. But the Mayor hasn't found\nJack to a King'\na suitable Columbus. Cue\nChristopher, a narcotics-chewing,\nHarlem-drawling black out-of-work\n\u2022actor, who just happens to have had\na gay affair with the Mayor. This\nskeletal storyline rapidly becomes\nan excuse for in-jokes ('Oops, I dropped the gerbil'), innuendoes\nand musical quips about the trials\nand traumas of being anything other\nthan white, middle class and he t ero in America. Oh dear.\nThe result is a despairingly bad\nexercise in social awareness which\nmakes you feel more like a voyeur\nat a freak show than a theatre goer. The first half was dragged back\nfrom the brink of crassness by\nRegina. the red-sequin ned drag\nqueen. But the whole production\nwould have been much more\npalatable crammed into a five-From a Jack to a King From a Jack to a King is written and\nperformed by the team that brought\nReturn to the Forbidden Planet to\nthe world. It is a raucous, loud,\nmusical about the rise and fall of\nmusician Eric Glamis (Stage name\nThane Cawdor) whose ambition\no' erie aps itself and soon leads to the\nmurder of the lead singer by\nsabotage of his motorbike. He is\nbrought to justice by the police\nwho, as we all know are not of\nwoman born.\nThe musical is very fast and\nsmooth, and the performers all\nproficient in a wide variety of\ninstruments and musical styles. The\none line jokes, mostly\nShakespearean and always fast,\nkeep the audience laughing and the\nvisual gags are hilarious. It is a tale\nfull of sound and fury, and it most\ndefinitely does signify nothing, but\nthose telling it are certainly not\nidiots. From a Jack to a King is a fairground ride. It is most enjoyable\nat the time, too shallow to have any\nlasting impact, but leave you\nwanting to return and re-experience\nit.\nStef\nFrom a Jack to a King is showing\nat the Ambassadors Theatre, West\nStreet.
