    "content": "N ews\n12 February 1993 Felix 957\nEnts undermined Walkway buy out\nby Declan Curry\nThe three-cornered tiff between\nRag, Imperial College Union (ICU)\nEnts and Imperial College Radio\ncontinues this week. The dispute\nbegan last week when Ents refused\na disco booking from Rag, despite\nthe personal intervention of Chris\nDavidson, ICU President, and\nMandy Hurford, Union General\nManager. The booking was for the\n'Great Rag Bash', the penultimate\nfunction of Rag Week. The disco\nwas eventually done last Friday by\nIC Radio, using a mix of their own\nequipment and some Ents\nequipment. The remaining Ents\nequipment, which is Union\nproperty, had been hired out for a private function by Dominic\nWilkinson, ICU Honorary\nSecretary.\nThe start of the 'Great Rag Bash'\nwas marred by a disagreement\nbetween Ents and IC Radio, with\nAndrew Kerr, Ents Chairman,\namong those refusing to allow IC\nRadio access to Ents equipment.\nRick Bilby, ICU Deputy Chairman,\nhad earlier given IC Radio\npermission to use some Ents\nequipment so that the disco could\nproceed. Mr Kerr, who refused to\nbe party to this, locked the\nequipment in a cupboard owned by\nEnts, and withheld the key. The\ndoor was subsequently opened by\nMr Bilby, who, as one of that\nnight's duty sabbaticals, also had a key. After some further heated\ndiscussion between Mr Bilby, Mr\nKerr, Ents, Rag and IC Radio, the\ndisco was allowed to continue. The\nhire fee for the disco had earlier\nbeen waived by IC Radio.\nDuring the later stages of the\nevening, Mr Kerr and another\nmember of the Ents team were\noverheard shouting personal abuse\nat Rachel Mountford, Rag\nChairman. Eyewitnesses told Felix\nthat some of the comments were\nin timid a tory, and were intended to\ncause upset and offence to Miss\nMountford. Miss Mountford and\nMr Kerr did not comment to Felix\non this incident.\nGraduates jobs drop\nby Declan Curry\nFurther evidence of student\nhardship was published this week\nalong with figures showing that\nonly 38% of last year's graduates\nwere fully employed by Christmas\n1992.\nA survey by Strathclyde\nUniversity welfare officers shows\nthat 15% of students occasionally\ngo without food, while 24% of\nundergraduates say they cannot\nafford textbooks. One in four\nStrathclyde students have term time\nwork. The welfare report says that\n'nearly everyone said that they\ncould not concentrate on studying\nbecause they worried daily about\nmaking ends meet'.\nThe Strathclyde report follows an\nearlier survey conducted by the\nTimes Higher Education\nSupplement. The THES poll,\nconducted among 2,770 readers,\nshowed that 75% of those asked\nthought student financial hardship\nis damaging academic standards.\nOnly 8.7% of those asked argued\nthat student hardship did not\ndamage standards.\nAllegations of financial hardship\nhave also attracted the attention of\nover 70 MPs who have signed a House of Commons motion which\nsays that 'under funding' has\nbrought about a crisis in higher\neducation. The motion says that a shortfall in funding has led to a 'lack\nof student accommodation forcing\nstudents to pay rents at exorbitant\nlevels'.\nThere has been a continuing\ndecline in the percentage of\ngraduates employed at the end of\ntheir graduating year, falling from\n51.5% in 1988 to last year's figure\nof just 38%. This contrasts with an\nincrease in the percentage of\ngraduates emigrating, going into\ntemporary employment or further\neducation and training.\nThe 1992 end of year graduate\nunemployment figure of 9.8% is up\nfrom the 1988 figure of 6.2%.\nby Andrew Tseng At Imperial College Union (ICU)\nCouncil on Monday, Chris\nDavidson, the ICU President,\nannounced plans for the\ndevelopment of the Sherfield\n'Walkway' that leads to the Junior\nCommon Room (JCR).\nThe plans involve the\nintroduction of trading outlets along\nthe walkway. Space would be\ncreated by reducing the size of the\nJCR and converting alcoves lining\nthe walkway into shop units.\nIlffffffl,\nIn an interview with Felix, Mr Davidson said that the plans were\nstill subject to a feasibility study.\nWhen questioned about the likely\ntimescale of the development, Mr\nDavidson said, 'I'd like to see it\nhappen over the summer'.\nNegotiations are currently\nunderway to determine whether the\noutlets will be run by the College\nor ICU. Discussions and market\nresearch on the type of outlets are\nalso taking place.\nDoors damaged\nby Andrew Tseng On Saturday evening, one of the\ndoors on the 2nd Mezzanine floor\nof the Union Building was kicked\ndown during a performance of a play by the Chinese society, who\nhave admitted liability to the\nincident. The door enclosed the\nmain light switch and junction\nboxes that supply electricity to the\nwhole of the Union Building.\nDavid Henderson-Begg, one of\nthe bar staff, and Steve Newhouse,\nan ICU steward, were the first on\nthe scene. The Chinese Society\nproduction was reportedly in an\nintermission when a security guard\nlocked the door, and as a result the\nChinese Society could not lower the\nhouse lights for the second half of\nthe performance.\nAfter trying, unsuccessfully, for\n20 minutes to get a key. One of the\nChinese Society members kicked\ndown the door. The shift engineer\nis reported to have wanted the\nperformance stopped immediately\nand the Chinese Society banned\nfrom the Union Building. However,\nin the event, the performance went\non without further incident.\nEvelyn Gardens common room change\nby Jacob And elin Shared common room facilities for\nall halls in Evelyn Gardens are to\nbe introduced, with the creation of\na single 'Evelyn Gardens' Hall of\nResidence. Current plans suggest\nthat all students will able to use the\nfour existing rooms in the Evelyn\nGardens area. These rooms would\nbecome a television room, a quiet\nroom for studying, and a room for\ndancing. No purpose has yet been\nfound for the fourth room.\nThe plan was announced at last l Monday's Imperial College Union\nCouncil meeting by Nicky Fox,\nUnion Housing Officer. The new\ncommunal common rooms will be\nplaced in the basement of existing\nhalls. Access will be from street\nlevel using the security\n'swipe cards'. Residents of the hall\nin which a particular social area is\nplaced will then be given exclusive\naccess to their hall from the\ncommon area, again by use of the\n'swipe cards'. Page 2\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews12 February 1993\nera\nThe Turn of the Screw Taken from Henry James' classic\ntale of ghosts and hysteria. Britten's chamber opera (libretto by My\nFanwy Piper) concerns the arrival\nof a young woman (Valerie\nMasterson) at the country house\nBly, there to act as governess to two\nchildren, Miles (Samuel Burkey)\nand Flora (Megan Kelly) in the\nabsence of their estranged guardian.\nBut her appearance uncovers (or\nperhaps precipitates) the terrifying\ndecline of the children towards evil,\nand finally possession.\nWhere James' novel hinted that\nthe source of the evil could be\nhysterical children and a neurotic\ngoverness. Britten's interpretation\nis very much that of the\nsupernatural\u2014a battle between good\nand evil. The music, fifteen\ncomplex variations of a single\ntwelve note pattern, creates such a Felix 957\nvariation of moods that the\nemotional extremes of the story are\nalmost casually mirrored. Here,\nconducted by James Holmes, the\nperformances of the central\ncharacters are exceptional\u2014notably\nPhilip Langridge as the ghost Peter\nQuint and Megan Kelly's Coliseum\ndebut as Flora. Her portrayal of a young girl dragged into evil has amel evo lent sexuality that is\ndecidedly creepy. Langridge's Quint, seemingly desperate to\ncontrol Miles, and battling with the\ngoverness for the boy's soul, is\nabsolutely haunting.\nWith an almost minimalist stage\nset which makes contrasting uses of\nboth projection and shadow,\nJonathan Miller's production (here\nrevised from its last performance in\n1991 by David Ritch) splendidly\ncaptures the essence of what is,\nafter all, a damn good ghost story.\nMJ Doyle\n\u2022 The London Coliseum, St\nMartin's Lane, WC2 NE5, Charing\nCross/Leicester Square tube. Box\nOffice 071-836 3161..\nRigoletto\nConcert\nGidon Kremer and Oleg M aise nberg The two respected recitalist s came\ntogether to give us a programme\nspanning a century of violin and\npiano repertoire. Unfortunately Mr\nMaisenberg had sustained a mysterious injury prior to the\nconcert forcing a change of\nprogramming, shunning Schubert's Rondo Brilliant and Bart6k's2 nd Sonata in preference to Schubert's2 nd Sonatine and two works from\nthe Second Viennese School. We\nwere, however, treated to three\nsplendid encores. Gidon Kremer'se leo que n ce and sonorous tone were\nbreath-taking, but somewhat\nmarred by his tendency to go\n'walk about' whilst performing,\nslightly akin to Nigel Kennedy\n(well, nothing like Nigel Kennedy\nreally, thank god) which was both\nvisually and acoustically off putting. Oleg Maisenberg's accompaniment\nwas both sensitive and individual,\nand my heart went out to him as he\nhobbled off and back onto the\nplatform after each number,\nobviously in great pain.\nThe Schubert, though\nmm\nHP\nI/;. \u202211111 \u2022 \u2014 mli it il ImH\nTurn of the Screw.\nRigoletto\nThe end of the first act; the cast take\na breather, the stage hands rush to\nchange the extraordinary set, and\nthe audience fumble for their\nprogrammes to try and work out\njust what the hell is going on. Well,\nit seems clear that our hunchbacked\nhero Rigoletto (complete with hump\nand outrageous limp) has been\ncursed by Monterone, and blatantly\nobvious that he's keeping a mistress\nlocked up at home (or is it his\ndaughter?). But who is Ceprano and\nwhy is everyone so keen to kidnap\nhis wife? Is the 'Duke' only after\ncheap tricks with Maddalena, or is\nhe really in love with Gilda? What\nwith all of the above and Sparafucile\n(the assassin, what else?) making\nassignations all over the place, you\ntend to get a bit confused and, only\noccasionally, lose the gist.\nHowever, these are mere cursory\ndetails\u2014the music is fantastic; a superficially a very simple piece for\nboth violinist and pianist, exploited\nthe intrinsically song-like character\nof the greatest song-writer of the\nmid-nineteenth century. This lyrical\nstyle, oddly, continued in the pieces\nof Webern and his mentor,\nShcoenberg, feeling rather out of\nplace where a more brash, coarse\ntone would have been more apt.\nThe second half brought 19th century works for Schullhof,\nDvorak and Liszt; fireworks after\nthe calm of the first three pieces.\nThe sublimely intense writing of\nSchullhof (who perished in the\nconcentration camps of the Second\nWorld War) and Dvorak were a wonderful contrast to the clinical\nHH dark, brooding overture, frenetic\nchanges in pace, and wonderfully\ndepressing ending. Sometimes the\norchestra (under the direction of\nMark Elder) seem to overpower the\nperformers, but this gives you\nample excuse for missing the plot.\nThe sets (designed by Patrick\nRobertson and Rosemary Verco)\nare breathtaking. The production\nhas placed the events in the New\nYork Mafia society of the 1950s, and whenever the curtains lift, the\naudience sit up.

    "content": "Felix 957\n'eat ure12 February 1993\nOn a bike and a prayer\nChris Riley finds the road to the Atlantic becomes more difficult in the\npenultimate episode of the Morroccan saga\nIt was over ten days later that we\nfreewheeled towards Jbel Toubkal.\nThe road climbed, twisted and\nweaved through the Pre-Cambrian\nlava flows, passing cliff side green\nvillages cascading from Iberian-buff\ncrags on a deep blue sky. Sour was\ntwenty-six kilometres away and\nlong in coming, particularly for\nAndrea who had been feeling sick\nall day. It had one shop where we\nbought vintage cokes and squeezed\nourselves into a chink of shade to\nswig them. The village came out to\nwatch, but quickly went inside\nwhen my camera emerged.\nMy rear tyre was refusing to stay\ninflated and I repaired it three times\nbefore we reached Amsouzart for\nour last stop before Toubkal. The\nvillage nestled by a broad clear ford\nand sprouted up the valley sides in\ngeometric blocks of balconies and\nwall-less rooms with post card\nviews. All around were timeless\nhills of wind washed cashew nut\ntrees and green meadows of grazing\nlazy livestock. The main street was\nshady and rubble strewn. Poultry\nclucked around the edges. The hotel\nowner was Omar - a man with a strong business acumen - a hotel to\nplease, and a relaxed 'anything is\npossible' attitude. The centre piece\nof the building was the middle floor\nof a vast airy room with cushions\nround the edge and a view up the\nvalley towards Imhilene.\nWhen you enquired the price - he\njust blinked slowly and said 'si vous\nvo u lez.' He bought us sweet milky\ncoffees in long glasses, and we sat\nand sipped them whilst staring up\nthe valley at the poplars and peach\ntrees swaying below the rose-red\nlofty peaks and the blackberry blue\nsky.\nIn the day light which remained\nI readied my bike for the planned\nascent of Toubkal tomorrow. It was\ndecided that I was the only one to\ntake the bike up the mountain. The\nother two would act as sherpa s to\ncarry the food, water and sleeping\nbags for the two nights and three\ndays on the peak. We would collect\na guide from the villages on the\nstruggled past a new house they\nwere building on the edge of town.\nHis little weasel y face looked us up\nand down and his one tainted tooth\nquivered with glee. He grabbed a load off us and beetled up the shady\nroad to his cafe to negotiate a price.\nThe 200 pounds he originally asked\nfor to act as guide dropped swiftly\nto 20 and after a nod of agreement\nfrom us, he disappeared inside the\nmud stained building to emerge two\nminutes later in a pair of broken\nslip-on-shoes, a pair of half-mast\nbrown corduroy trousers and a short\nsleeve shirt. His luggage was a white plastic bag of two pieces of\nbread and a tin of sardines. Armed\nthus, he put on both Andrea's and\nStephane's ruc sacs, causing his\nneck to be bent double and his chin\nto rest on his chest - and he was off\nup the rubble y path to Lake Ifni.\nBy the time I caught everyone up\ncarrying my bike over the rubble y hair-pin bent track, the guide was\nhaving reservations about his\nimpossible load. I left the other two\nto sort out a new deal involving a mule and plodded on up the cliff-like s cree slope, bike over shoulder.\nIt was beyond my comprehension\nthat a man dressed so inadequately\ncould guide us without food up such\ninhospitable terrain. We pressed on\nin the afternoon across a gigantic\nbeach of shingle over a mile long,\nfrom the lake to the Toubkal Gorge.\nAs I bumped my bike over the rocks\nwe passed a group of French\ntrekkers heading down from\nToubkal. They nodded but hardly\nacknowledged us as if we were\npedestrians on the Champs Elysees\n- instead of adventurers at the base\nof North Africa's highest mountain.\nFrom the edge of the shingle the\ntrack climbed like some never\nending loft ladder up to the peaks\nof the rich brown cones. The peaks\nwere a world away and scratching\nat the passing cu mulo nimbus and\ncirrus clouds which flew in\nformation vapour trailing over the\nrocks. The perspective was\ndestroyed by the immensity of such\nstructures and it was inconceivable\nto imagine we could ever reach it\nby climbing alone - let alone\ncarry in ea bicycle!\nThe story finally concludes in the\nFelix Travel Special, Next Week!\nPage 11\n\n"

We travelled up on\nthe Friday evening, eventually\nfinding a campsite and more\nimportantly a pub.\nWe awoke on Saturday morning\nto find ourselves in the middle of\nthick mist, with no sign of the mild,\nsunny day the weather forecasters\nhad promised. However after a quick trip into Buxton to stock up\nwith food, we ventured to the crag.\nThe weather gave no signs of\nimproving, but undeterred we\nventured onto a few of the easier\nclimbs. During the day there were\nfew flashes of brilliance from the\nclub's star climbers, but beginners\nhad plenty of experience of easier\nclimbs. The day ended with Andy\ngetting stuck half way up a climb\ncalled 'Pedalstal Crack' in failing\nlight, but a rope was lowered to him\nand he eventually climbed up, it\nnow being completely dark. We\nspent the evening back in the pub,\nfinally out-drinking Coventry\nPolytechnic's Mountaineering Club\n(we know they're no longer a poly,\nbut it seems they don't). During the night there was a large\namount of rain, which was good\nnews for those who wanted a lie in.\nBy 9.00am the rain had stopped, but\nit had been replaced by an icy wind.\nWe returned to the crag hoping that\nthe wind had dried the rock. For\nonce it had, and the base of the crag\nwas even slightly sheltered from the\nwind. This was not the case at the\ntop and the lead climber was often\nalmost frozen solid by the time their\nsecond had followed them up.\nDuring the afternoon we even saw\nthe sun (a rare event) and harder\nSneakers\nThis week, FilmSoc is pleased to be\nshowing Sneakers, a high-tech\nmovie with stacks of stars in it, lots\n) of laughs, and a plot that Time Out\ndescribed as 'tw is tier than a^ Mandelbrot Curve'. Still playing on\nLeicester Square, the film features\nDan Aykroyd, River Phoenix,\nMary McDonnell and Sidney\nPoitier supporting Robert Redford\nand Ben Kingsley as good guy and\nbad guy who were once partners in\ncomputer crime together. Redford\nplays Martin Bishop, who heads a team of computer gurus who\nspecialise in hacking to test\ncorporate security systems.\nBishop's dark past catches up with\nhim, when the CIA use it to force\nhim and his team to do a job for\nthem, and retrieve a little black box\nof particular interest to them. Using\ntheir limitless supply of Bond-style\ngadgets in all manner of dangerous\nsurroundings, the team battle to get\nthe box, leading to a showdown\nbetween Redford and Kingsley,\nwho plays a surprisingly mean bad\nguy with a really mean pony tail.\nThe cleverest comedy thriller in a long time, from the amusing\nanagrams of the actor's names in\nthe opening titles, to the hilarious\nfinal scene, this film is guaranteed\nto make you chuckle and will please\neverybody. This is one not to be\nmissed!\nEntrance is only 90p for\nmembers, otherwise \u00a31.90, and\nmembership is a real bargain at\n\u00a33.50 including Sneakers free,\nespecially when you consider that\nin the next few weeks we've got\nPeter's Friends, Death Becomes\nHer, and White Men Can't Jump all\nqueueing up for the chance to be\nmatched in Mech Eng 220.

However IC\nbounced straight back, scoring\nalmost immediately with a well\nworked move from defence,\nthrough midfield onto R Snell and\nJ Diss and finally crossed by A Said\nto be crusted home by N Strevens.\nA second goal from IC followed 10\nminutes later resulting from a quick\nthrow, from new boy K Burrett, to\nSaid who buried clinically. One, of\ncourse, thinks back to the midfield\nhustle by D Buckle to ensure the\nthrow.\nThe second half continued in the\nsame euphoric vain with Diss\nconverting our relentless pressure\ninto points, additionally opening his\naccount for IC, with a text book\nheader from a pin-point corner.\nOne, of course, thinks back to the\nmidfield hustle by D Buckle to\nensure the corner. The game\nprogressed from this point with IC\nconsolidating in defence assisted by\nfine performances from A Gelli and\nK Otikoju who were both new to the\nfull back positions. Crunching\ntackles were prevalent in midfield\nand were complemented perfectly\nwith the ability and vision of M Dikko and K Burrett up front.\nOnce IC held their death grip\nthere was never going to be any\nescape for St Georges. The final\nnail in their coffin was a fourth goal\nbeautifully converted by Said from\na fine through-ball by one of the old\nhands, R Ramachandran. The final\nwhistle blew before the game could\nbe restarted.\nSurely after this performance no\none can fancy getting IC in the\nsemi-final draw, and we face this\npenultimate game with the\nunquestioned inevitability of\npreceding to Motspur Park for the\nfinal. One, of course, looks to D Buckle to ensure that destiny is\nassured.\nFirst Results\nThe Imperial College Indoor\nFootball Tournament (IC 1ST) started this week.

    "content": "Power Play Rhian Pic ton reports to mere mortals about ICU Council.\nFelix 957\n'eat ure12 February 1993\nMy name is Rhian Picton. I am the\nBiochemistry Department\nRepresentative. Part of my job is to\nsit on Imperial College Union\nCouncil, to represent my\ndepartment's views and to\ncontribute to any discussions that\ninvolve students. There was\nrecently an academic affairs half-day, which all the departmental and\nacademic representatives were\ninvited to. This was an opportunity\nto question the Rector (Sir Eric\nAsh), Vernon McClure and Gareth\nJones (the College Senior Tutor)\nabout academic problems in the\ndepartments.\nHowever, it was blatantly\nobvious that a lot of the academic\nrepresentatives didn't know a lot\nabout what happens in college and\nthe union, and more specifically are\nvague about what happens at\nCouncil. If they don't know such\nthings, how is anyone else supposed\nto know? Someone there asked why\nnothing was printed in Felix, and I said that I would bring it up at\nCouncil.\nWhich is why, the day after\nCouncil, I am writing this. When\nI mentioned that I thought every\nstudent should know what happens\nat Council, there was unanimous\nagreement from the council\nmembers. We all give up time to\ndiscuss the issues that a lot of people\nmight dismiss as boring, and we\nwould like to know if other students\nare happy with what decisions we\nmake. Do people think anything?\nThe government may try to disband\nstudent unions before too long, and\nI think that we would lose any\nidentity as a student body that we\nstill have now, if we lost the student\nunion, and that worries me. Some\npeople don't even know what the\nunion does. Does anyone care?\nWhat follows this is a quick\ndescription of who and what ICU\nCouncil is and an account of the\nJanuary Council.\nIn next week's Felix, there will\nbe an account of what happened at\nyesterday's(8 th February) Council,\nbecause I have run out of room.\nAt the end of the January report,\nI will include the most urgent\nproblem from the February\nCouncil, as people's opinions are\nwelcome.\nICU Council. Who is it?\nICU Council consists of the people\nwho do a job within ICU. They\ninclude Steve Farrant (Chair of\nICU; the ICU exec, Chris, Rick and\nDom; C CU Presidents; Academic\nRepresentatives for ICU, CCU's, departments; Officers, such as\nwomen's and welfare; Chair\npeople, such as Rag, Overseas\nCommittee (OSC), Athletic Clubs\nCommittee (ACC); Old Students\nRepresentatives; two first years,\nwho were elected at the first ICU\nU GM; and four permanent\nobservers, Cathy and Mandy from\nthe Union Office, Howard\n(Publicity Officer) and Jonty (Felix\nEditor).\nWhat is it?\nICU Council is an open arena\u2014\nanyone can come along and\nspeaking rights are usually given.\nThe officers can submit written\nreports and request the support and\nopinions of Council regarding\nthings that they would like to do.\nCouncil members can question\ndecisions made by people on\nCouncil, and if a debate arises a vote is taken to decide what Council\nthinks should be done.\nSo, what happened at the last\nCouncil?\nThe minutes of Decemeber\nCouncil were passed. There were\nno matters arising from them.\nReports to Council were then\ndiscussed.\nImportant points from the\nreports.\nChris's Report\n1. When the government were\ndiscussing making students'\nmembership to Unions voluntary,\nICU set up a working party to\ndecide how we could attract\nmembers if it happened. We\ndecided to promote ICU to both the\ngovernment and students as an\norganisation that is vital for helping\nstudents, as there was unclear ness on the role of the Union. A new\nmeeting has been called.\n2. the Walkway outside the JCR\nmay be developed into retail units.\nThis is a great idea which is still\n1\nbeing discussed.\n3. One of the ideas of the\nvoluntary membership working\nparty was to hold a 'Reaching Out\nStall' that had information on all the\nclubs and societies of ICU. This\nwas held successfully on January\n19th.4. An 'employment agency' may\nbe set up to act as a go-between for\nstudents and college/local job\nvacancies.\nAny other business is the final part\nof Council.\nThere was a discussion about the\narticle in Felix that reported Chris\nDavidson as being drunk at UL U GUC (General Union Council).\nSeveral people at Council were at\nthe meeting, and they told Council\nthat the report was untrue in parts.\nIt was felt that an accurate account\nof the events should be sent to Felix\nas the reputation of ICU's President\ncould be damaged if he ignored the\nreport (as he wanted to).\nThe final thing to mention then is\na subject that was brought up for\ndiscussion at yesterday's council\n(8th February).\nTim Cotton, the transport officer\nis in charge of ICU's minibus fleet.\nThe insurance policy will need\nrenewing in just under 14 days. At\nthe moment if a driver crashes aw\\ minibus he/she must pay the first\n\u00a3100.00 for the claim. This,\nCouncil felt, was a totally\nunreasonable amount of money to\nexpect students to pay. Council\nsuggested several things to Tim.\n1. Try to find a better insurance\ncompany.\n2. If there is no cheaper insurance\ncompany then ICU must find a way\nto help the students eg create a SLUSH fund (which would cover\nsome of the initial payment).\n3. This would probably result in\nthe price of hiring an ICU minibus\nincreasing, but it will still be\nnecessary to maintain the fleet,\nsince drivers of private-hire\nminibuses must be 23 years old.\nObviously, not many clubs and\nsocieties have members that old\nwho could drive for them. This is\nwhy Council want ICU to maintain\nthe minibus fleet.\nAnyone with any questions,\nideas, thoughts, agreements or\narguments with my personal ideas,\nor with any decisions we make on\nCouncil can get in touch with us via\nFelix, the Union, their Dep Reps,\nClubs and Societies chair people etc.\nBut please, we are trying to help the\nstudents, not harm them, and we\nwelcome any comments if we can\nuse them to improve what we do.\nPage 9\n\n"

He puts in a convincing performance as Leon\nBernstein (The Great Bernzini), a freelance photographer who sleeps\nby day in a seedy room the size of\na broom cupboard. At night he\nprowls the streets of 1930s New\nYork listening to the police\nbroadcasts of crime and accidents.\nHis pictures are sensational to the\ntabloids but more importantly first\nto reach the press office. His\nnocturnal activities make him a lonely and un trusting cynic who\nnever wants to get involved with\nwhat is on the other side of the lens.\nEnter Barbara Hershey as the\nfemme fatale. He falls hopelessly in\nlove with her and one by one breaks\nhis own rules on her behalf. The\nFBI take an interest in his activities\nwith the mafia and he uses the\nsituation to further his dream of\nhaving his work published as\nserious photojournalism. Leon is\nbased on a real photographer\nWidgee and some of the\nphotographs used in the film are his.\nThe story is Tio t very well paced and\nat times seems to be going nowhere\nyet perseverance pays off in the\nend. (The use of stills and music is\nvery effective from director\nHoward Franklin, together with the\nsets and costumes help make an\natmospheric if a little slow.)\nCaptain Caveman.\nIt's life, Jim, but not as we know it.\nStay Tuned Aren't first impressions somewhat\ndeceiving at times? I mean, this film\nhas a plot most would scoff at,\ntrailers and press releases most\nwould choose only to ignore, but\nno, I thought. Amongst the wafer\nthin plot lies an almost irresistible\nchocolate layer of a film, whipped\nuntil smooth and fluffy, creamy and\ndark yet wholly innocent. Yes that's right this film is so stupid and crazy\nit's funny.\nWhat you get for your money is\nan hour and a half of deep-throated\ntelevision satire, oh yes there is a plot amongst all that but it soon gets\nlost and forgotten as you sit almost\nuncontrollably on the edge of your\ncomfy, soft cushioned, Spanish\ninquisition less chair, waiting for the\nnext piss take, seeing if you can\nguess the sketch before all is\nrevealed.\nmm\n91k Basically, that's what this film\nbecomes, a collection of Saturday\nNight Live type sketches pasted\ntogether with one of those ' Mr Couch Potato gets sucked into\ntelevision land by Beelzebub's friend shunted from programme to\nprogramme as he tries to survive 24\nhours of shite telly' storylines.\nTry and see this film, not for a story or a splendid evening's entertainment but to laugh as loud\nas you can in the cinema at every\nsketch you see. Keep an eye out for\n'Yogi Beer' 'Silencer of the\nLambs', '30 Something to Life', '3\nMen and Rosemary's Baby' and\nespecially 'Dwayne's Underworld!,\nDwayne's Underworld!' Party\ntime, excrement!

We\nrepresent the lucky few who have\nbeen provided with the\nopportunities to study abroad, and\nare constantly aware of the welfare\nof the less fortunate. To make it\neven more meaningful and\nmemorable, we have volunteered to\ncontribute a significant amount of\nany profit made (balances unclear\nat the time of writing) to selected\ncharities, both of this country and\nMalaysia.\nTo conclude, the Malaysian\nSociety has come a long way, right\nfrom the formulation of concepts to\nthe realisation of the 'Hibiscus\nEvening'. Once again, my utmost\ngratitude to the working committee,\nbackstage crews, and men and\nwomen who have put on their\ntraditional garments, some\nundoubtedly for the very first time.\nYours sincerely,\nHMKho,\nChairman, Malaysian Night\nCommittee.\nIMightline\nDear Editor,\nI am writing to inform your\nreaders that London Nightline at\nUL U has now become a Registered\nCharity (number 1015744). London\nNightline has been running for over\n22 years providing confidential help\nand information to students in\nLondon. Nightline is run by\nstudents who have been trained in\nthe art of telephone counselling and\nlistening.\nAs a registered charity our\nobjects are:\n'To provide relief of persons\nsuffering from despair and distress\nwho are students at any legal\ninstitution of further education in\nLondon and neighbourhood by the\nprovision of a telephone helpline,\nthus reducing the incidence of\nsuicide amongst such persons.'\nThe lines are open 6pm8 am everyday during term time, phone\n071-436 5561.\nYours,\nSarah-Jane C Morris,\nCoordinator London Nightline.\nSKJI (gX\u00ae s/b v,s iw st fy Find me a place where the sun never sets\nDear Jonty,\nIt is some time since I have\nwritten to Felix but after reading the\nletter last week from the cowardly\nCrocky I felt I must put pen to paper\nand respond to this badly written\npiece of drivel. I say cowardly since\nthis person doesn't even have the\nguts to sign his/her real name.\nHe/she is obviously ashamed, quite\nunderstandably, of the inaccurate\nand curious arguments, let's take\nthe points in turn.\nCrocky goes on about how the\nmonarchy does not provide any\nidentity to this, or Commonwealth,\ncountries. Not being a Royalist\nmyself I am not bothered about his\ncriticisms of the monarchy.\nHis curious references to\nBritain's part in world history do\nhowever bother me, not just\nbecause he is wrong on a number\nof issues. When British forces left\ncolonial territories yes there were\ntroubles, but can't he see that it was\nthe very fact British forces were\nthere that kept peace and stability\nfor many of the preceding years?\nHe also makes reference to\nWorld War II. Nobody in the world\ncan criticise Britain's role in this\nwar. People like him are an\nembarrassment to the memory of\nthe many brave men and women\nwho laid down their lives for the\nfreedom of the world. He should be\ngiven a white feather.\nAnother point he made regarding\nthe creation of '...several new\ncountries hating one another guts.'\nThis again he blames on the British.\nAt least Crocky is consistent. This\nis the same rubbish that he spouts\nthroughout the entire letter. The\nreason why there are troubles in the\nMiddle East, Ireland and the Indian\nsub-continent is due to Mad\nMullahs, terrorist scum and\nreligious fanatics.\nOne of the most extraordinary\nclaims is '...we may not even\nunderstand the recent war with\nArgentina'. What are you on? The\nreason is simple. Our boys kicked\nout a bunch of jumped-up Argies\nwho invaded British sovereign\nterritory. We had an obligation to\nprotect the British dependants living\nthere.\nStill he keeps spewing s*** like\na broken sewage pipe. The\nEuropean Community is the next\nissue he turns his ignorance to. It\nwas a sad day when we joined the\nCommunity, but now we're in it we\nmust attempt to stop the ludicrous\ndirectives. We must also attempt to\nscupper Mr Delors plans of a united\nEurope. Unfortunately Mr Major,\nunlike his predecessor, is not able\nto do this.\nCrocky then writes '...try to\nrebuild Britain through positive\naspects.' This, after a whole letter\ns lagging off Britain\u2014in particular\nit turns out the English.\nHe finally slags off all those who\nhe thinks support the monarchy.\nOne of the categories was '...beer\ndrinking bog roll newspaper\nreaders.' By this I have been told\nhe means certain tabloids\u2014the most\npopular newspapers in the whole of\nthe country. By this snobbish and\nsuperior attitude he just confirms\nthe view that many decent people\nwould already have of him. That he\nsuffers from the British disease,\ncommonly held by the middle-class\nintelligentsia chattering classes,\nwho tell ordinary blok es like myself\nhow to think. They can't wait to put\nour country down at every\nopportunity and look down on the\nvast majority of British people He\nis an undesirable element who has\nno place in this country.\nYours as ever,\nAlan Bailey.\nP.S.I refer to Crocky as he\nbecause no female could write such\nrubbish.\nage 5\n\n"

Chris Davidson is eating\ndaffodils by the root. Who dunn it, where, with what and ... WHY?\nThe as yet unexplained death of the\nuncontested leader of IC Union has\nprompted RAG to offers thousands\nof prizes to the teams that will help\nthem in the quest for the murderer.\nSo shake that ass and play\nCLUE DO tomorrow (or pretend to\nbe a duck-billed platypus for the\nday). If you haven't been hung-over\nfor the whole week, you should\nhave noticed the odd dead-body\noutline around Imperial College. If\nyour IQ is positive (in IC?) you may\nhave associated them with\nCLUE DO this term's Sexiest,\nHottest, Grooviest, Most gory RAG\nevent yet. So what's all this hype?\nCome to think of it, what's CLUE DO anyway? Remember\nMONOPOLY? Well CLUE DO uses the same concept, take a small\nfry board game and make it BIG,\nvery BIG, London BIG. CLUEDO\nis based on the well known board\ngame... CLUE DO( A concept that\nEVEN a physicist can come to grips\nwith). Those of you who have never\nplayed CLUEDO haven't lived. But\nyou can come and redeem yourself\nthis Saturday. The main aim of our\nCLUEDO, is for you to have fun,\nhowever, as a sideline, a bit of do sh for RAG would be welcome. The\nmoney you collect goes to BIBIC.\nBIBIC is the British Institute for\nBrain Injured Children.\nTiddlywinks was big, but it hurt\nyour fingers, Monopoly was\nbigger, but not gory enough, The\nGreat Sightseeing Challenge was\nlarge, but where were the mascots?\nAnswer: They were w anning up for\nthe biggest event of the all...\nCLUE DO.

Mr. Stud 93,\nChris 'Scottish but Horny'\nDavidson. Convinced yet? OK,\nhere's what you do: Turn up in Beit\nQuad as soon as possible after 10\nAM on Saturday with a team of four\nto six people. At this point, you'll\nbe given a collecting tin and a clue\nsheet. The object of the game is to\nvisit the nine locations around\nLondon that are relevant to the\nrooms on the CLUEDO board. The\ncatch here is the fact that you have\nto work out, from the clues, where\nthese locations actually are. For\nexample the Hall might be the\nRoyal Albert Hall (its not). The\nrooms are: Billiards Room, Dining\nRoom, Conservatory, Ballroom,\nKitchen, Library, Lounge, Study\nHall\nThe characters are:\nMiss Peacock Blue\nMiss Scarlet Red\nMrs White Guess\nAgent Orange...You will know him\nwhen you see him\nProf. Plum Purple\nGrim Reaper Black\nRev. Green Green\nDr. Black Black\nThe weapons are:\nRevolver\nDagger\nRope\nLead Pipe Theta\nSpanner....Spanner & Bolt\nCandlestick Davey\nAnyway, at each of the locations\nthere will be either one of the\ncharacters or one of the weapons.\nWhen you think that you have\nspotted one of them ask them: 'Do\nyou wear roll-on deodorant?'. If\nyou have the right person then you\nwill get a signature on your clue\nsheet and a clue as to WHY the\nmurder happened. If you don't have\nthe right person...\nOh by the way, if you are having\ntrouble working out the clues, the\nmarshall s are eminently bribe able( currency unit: 1 pint). If you find\nDr. Black (the dead guy) cavorting\nwith the Grim Reaper then you have\nfound the scene of the crime. To\nfind who dunn it and using which\nweapon you have to visit every\nlocation on the board and deduce\nwhom and what is missing. I should\nmention at this point that none of\nthe C CU mascots were involved.\nThey will be making an appearance\nat some random time and if you\nhappen to be there at the same time\nas one of them, you get bonus\npoints. Did I mention treasure?\nWhen you think you know why\nChris was assassinated (him being\nScottish is not sufficient) then your\nteam can act out a short sketch\nillustrating your brain wave. If you\nhave collected any relevant\n'treasure' (no not traffic cones or\nshopping trolleys) along the way\nyou will get extra points for using\nthem as props. On the subject of\npoints, here is how they work: 1 pt-for each pound collected (divided\nby team size) 10 pts- for each\nlocation signature (50 if mascot was\nthere) 25 pts- for right place 50 pts-for right assassin points are doubled\nfor a full set of signatures max. 50\npts for sketch.\nThere will be separate prizes for\nwinning team and highest collector.\nLast year Cambrige RAG took part\nand whipped our ass. This year we\nalso have to contend with Charing\nCross and Essex, so this time pull\nyour finger out and fight for the\nrecovery of our honour. Finally;\ndon't forget to collect lots of money\nalong the way.\nPage 12\n\n"

The correct procedure\nfor any student having grievances\nwith a permanent member of staff,\nparticularly an ICU receptionist, is\nto approach the President of the\nUnion or the Union manager, who\nwill deal promptly and disc ret ly with their complaint. In this\nparticular instance, if I were dealing\nwith the matter I would have\nushered Mr Pearson into my office,\nasked him to take a seat, listened to\nhis deprecation and then offered\nhim some advice or appropriate\nchannel of action, such 'Why don't you fuck off and get a life you\nan ally retentive dip shit'.\nThis response if of course a complete fallacy, but is though as\nfactually accurate as the content of\nMr Pearson's letter, who\nincidentally I'm told, had to be\ndirected on the correct spelling of\nmenstrual, which as a point of\ninformation for Mr Pearson has\nsomething to do with women and\nnothing to do with a chocolate\ncovered sweet (that melts in your\nmouth and not in your hand).\nThough I should imagine that Mr Pearson's experience with the latter\nfar outweighs his experience of the\nformer.\nAs a second and concluding point\nof information the term 'menstrual\ntension' is incorrect as it is now a medically recognised syndrome, the\ntitle of which is PMS, which\ncoincidentally also happens to be\nthe three title letters of Permanent\nMember of Staff.\nSpooky isn't it?\nDominic Wilkinson,\nHonorary Secretary (Events) ICU\nDear Jonty,\nI read Felix 956 with interest, I refer particularly to Lorna\nMountford's letter.

The exact problems are\nnot known but the project is now 6\nweeks beyond the planned opening\ndate of Monday 4th January.\nPrevious delays in the opening have\nbeen attributed to: too many\ncommittees and the hardness of the\nground in which the Sports Centre\nis located.\nElections\nby G Light & D Curry\nThe election for the 1993-4 Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) sabbatical\nposts ignited this week. Election\npapers were posted outside the\nUnion office last Monday at\n9.30am. By Thursday evening, six\ncandidates had publicly declared\ntheir ambitions, and two Ian Davies\nand David Goddard, were already\nproposed and fully seconded. At the\ntime of Felix going to press late on\nThursday, the declared candidates\nwere Ian Davies, Beccy Land,\nDavid Goddard, Max Jalil, Charles\nLeary and Rachel Mountford. New\nElection will also stand for all posts.\nRachel Mountford, a third year\nCivil Engineering student, is\nstanding for the post of ICU\nPresident, currently held by Chris\nDavidson. Miss Mountford is\ncurrently Chairman of Rag. Ms\nMountford will almost certainly be\nchallenged by Andrew Wensley a third year mathematician, Mr Wensley has yet to officially declare\nMr Rick Bilby, ICU Deputy\nPresident, did not know how\nstudents would be compensated for\nthe further loss of use of the Sports\nCentre. The contract under which\nthe refurbishments took place\nmeans that the contractors will\nsuffer a penalty for every day of\ndelay. It is expected that the delay\nnow incurred will create serious\ndebate about how much the\ncontractors should be paid.\nEven though the work has yet to\nbe completed, an unofficial opening\nwill be held at midday today for\nsenior members of Imperial College\nto preview the changes.\nhis candidature.\nMiss Mountford, who has ten\nsecond ers, has not, as yet, been\nproposed for the post of President.\nMarc Swan, President of St. Mary's Hospital Medical School Students'\nUnion, angrily denied speculation\nin last weeks Felix that he would act\nas Miss Mountford's proposer. Ms\nMountford was proposed late on\nThursday by Nicky Fox, ICU\nHousing Officer.\nDavid Goddard has put his name\nforward for Deputy President, a post currently held by Rick Bilby.\nMr Goddard, in Physics 3, has been\nproposed by Sarah McCartney, a third year Maths student. Mr Goddard was last year's editor of\nBroadsheet, the RCSU news sheet. Mr Goddard is one of sixteen\nstudents seconding the candidature\nof Charles Leary, a biologist\nstanding for the post of Honorary\nSecretary Events (Hon Sec). Mr Leary is currently Chairman of the\nJazz and Rock Club, one of the\nThe Queen Mother (Gawd bless her) after visiting the Royal College of\nMusic on Tuesday\nUnion's newest societies. Mr Leary\nhas been proposed by Graham Hay,\ncurrently Chairman of the Social,\nCultural and Amusements Board, a Union Major Sub- Committee.\nAnother of Mr Leary's second ers is Rachel Mountford, presidential\ncandidate. By 4.30 pm on Thursday\nanother candidate, Max Jalil had\nalso stood for the post. Max, this\nyear's Broadsheet co-editor, is\nseconded by four people and has no\nproposer.\nIan Davies, a third year computer\nscientist, is standing as prospective\nFelix editor. Mr Davies known as\n'Poddy' and 'Lise Yates' is\ncurrently Felix music editor. A somewhat controversial figure, Mr\nDavies' candidature was, until\nrecent weeks, a well-kept secret.\nMr Davies has been proposed by\nMark Jackson, otherwise known as\n'Trig'. Beccy Land will also be\nstanding for the position and has\nbeen proposed by Stuart Rison.\nFelix, IC Radio and STOIC will\nfully cover the elections, bach\nmedia is bound to provide equal\no port unity for every candidate to\nput across their case. IC Radio and\nSTOIC interviews for each post are\nto be announced and coverage in\nFelix must include each of the\ncandidates names in the body of the\nreport.

Anatole,\nan actor, is brought to the estate in\norder to train a group of serfs to\nperform before their Count and\nCountess.\nThe small cast performed well,\nnot only in their main roles, but also\nin the parts they played during the\nreminiscences of Anatole, and\nothers. Movement played an\nimportant part in the play, and\nworked well to convey the varying\nmoods, especially Yermilovna's Foot Above the Head Foot Above the Head is an adaption\nand re-working of Shakespeare's unfinished play 'Timon of Athens'.\nA cast of eight women including a violinist, explore the story of false,\nprofitable friendships.\nTimon of Athens is an unusual\nplay and certainly incomparable\nwith the great Shakespeare tragedies\nthat preceded it. Blood Stone has\nmanaged to adapt the original text,\nfull of roughness and\ninconsistencies, into a performance\nthat is finished in its conception.\nTimon, a mistress of Athens, is\nsurrounded with many, false and\nflattering friends. She is naive and\nunaware of her financial state. Her\nbounty shows itself in hedonism and\nhigh living, more than old-fashioned benevolence. Sudden\ndiscovery of naivety, and finally,\nunexpected discovery of an\ninexhaustible supply of gold make\nthe whole story seem like a fairy-tale. However this does not detract\nfrom greatness of this work. The\nexact cause of Timon's death is left\npoetically obscure.\nSioban Stamp, as Timon, gave a good performance, however, acting\nwasn't the strong point of this play;\nthe stage, with real desert sand,\nwas. Every detail was chosen with\ncare and objects falling from ceiling\nmake a great metaphor showing\nTimon's beliefs in people and\nwealth disappearing. It is worth\nmentioning the stage manager, well\ndone, Anna Howarth!\nIf you are in a fringe theatre\nmood, Foot Above the Head, a benefit for Friends of the Earth, is\nworth a visit.\nE Clarici, J Dymott.\n\u2022 Turtle Key Arts Centre, Farm\nLane, Fulham, Fulham Broadway\ntube.

Tuesday: Pay What you\nCan (min \u00a31) + 50p. dance for her dead husband.\nThe use of a narrator who was\ninvolved in the story added a great\ndeal. For some of the relatively\nyoung cast it was obviously difficult\nto relax, leading to a slightly stilted\nnature of some of the scenes, but the\nmajority of the acting was very\ngood.\nThe theatre can be found in a large garage at the back of a county ard( hence the theatre's name), and seats about thirty. Its\nsmall nature draws you into the\nplay. I highly recommend this\nplay\u2014it's fairly cheap for one thing,\nbut a word of warning\u2014wear warm\nclothes as the theatre is very cold.\nLaura.\n\u2022 Courtyard Theatre, 10 York\nWay, Nl, Kings Cross tube. Box\nOffice 071-833 0870.\nSmall Talk About Chromosomes You can be quite sure it's going to\nbe something different when the\ncast troop in, sit down at the table\nlaid out as if for a press conference,\nand immediately shoot off into mad\ndebate, all conducted via\nmicrophones.\nActually this is just the beginning\nof a strange, dazzling and often\ndownright bizarre piece concerning\nitself with what happens when Bill\nand Shona (James Eastaway and\nSue Mound) find their relationship\nrapidly disintegrating. The title\nrefer to the work of a doctor,\nexceptionally acted by William\nBrooke (he is one of the two real\ndoctors supposedly in the play?),\nwhose job it is to counsel them on\nthe consequences of embryo testing.\nThe refreshing style mooted here\ntranslates particularly well in the\nBush, a small theatre above a pub,\nwhere the closeness of the cast\ndefinitely adds something.\nAdditionally the clever use of music\nbreaks, the dance routines and a well constructed set which makes\ngood use of limited space. My only\nreservation was with the film at the\nend: entitled 'Pier Pressure' and\nprojected from the stage for the\ncharacters to watch, it involved a day at the seaside with two\nun introduced children, Bill and the\ndoctor. Just where this left us, after\nthe play had seemingly been wound\nup, I'm uncertain. Nevertheless\nafter only two years together\n'Theatre PUR can feel rightly proud\nof this entertaining and highly\noriginal piece of theatre.\nTom.\n\u2022Bush Theatre, Shepherd's Bush\nGreen, W12, Shepherd's Bush/Goldhawk Road tube.

The programme permits a diversity of forms and styles to be\npresented, each complimenting the\nother. 'Paramour' is a light-hearted\nlook at flirtations between two\ncouples,.with an amusing twist in\nthe tail. This was followed by a complete change of mood with\n'Twilight'. A ballet for two dancers\nexploring sexual politics within a couple's relationship. A very\nmodern ballet, it received a muted\nresponse, despite being extremely\nwell performed. I was pleased to\nsee the Birmingham Royal Ballet,\nstill prepared to present such\ndifficult and little-seen works.\nKenneth MacMillan's Pas de deux\nto Faure's 'Pavane' followed, and\nimmediately the mood changed\nagain. Beautiful and moving, an apt\ntribute to the great choreographer\nwho died late last year. 'Don\nQuixote'\u2014Pas de deux, notably the\nonly non-20th century ballet of the\nevening, was next on show and can\no bly be described as stunning.\nLively, vibrant and exciting, the\ncrowd actually cheered and w his ded at the dancers. I have never seen a reception like this, to a ballet,\nbefore.\nNext stop, 'Facade', a witty,\npopular ballet consisting of seven\nshort dances. This proved to be an\namusing interlude before the final\nand longest of the evening's offerings\u2014'The Green Table'.\nAltogether, a powerful and\nimposing ballet, it portrays\nexcel lend y the horror and futility of\nwar. The whole show was superbly\npresented and left us all slightly\noverawed.\nAn all-round-enjoyable evening,\nand I would recommend\nBirmingham Royal Ballet's 'mixed\nbag' evenings to anybody\u2014\nparticularly if you've never been\nbefore. They make an excellent\nintroduction to the diversity of the\nmedium.\nFOB.\nHobson' s Choice Boot boy rises to run cobbler's shop\nvia spinster sister and Drunken\nMaster... Hmm!\nEschewing the staple ballet ic fare\nof swans, fairies and an influx of\nnational dancers. Composer, Paul\nReade, and choreographer, David\nBintley, have produced a stunning\nfull length ballet from Harold\nBrighouse's northern rags to riches\nfable.\nReade's pretty melodies and witty\nrhythms explore every plot detail\n(try to overlook some grotesque\n'Hollywoodesque' orchestrations by\nLawrence Ashton) and Bintley\nembellishes each note with\nenchantingly natural and\nrefreshingly original steps. The\nresult is an involving, fluid and\ndetailed dramatic line unusual in the\nclassical ballet medium.\nBirmingham Royal Ballet's production polishes every facet of\nthis modern classic to a sparkle:\nVincent Redman's shyly chirp y boot boy wins every heart including\nMarion Tate's. Her tight-lipped\nMaggie has the guts and grace of\na shrewd woman not to be messed\nwith. Her sisters, and attendant\nbeaux are touchingly young, happy\nand in love. Every nuance and\noutburst in Bintley's steps is\ndelivered with ease and oo mph. DO\nNOT MISS THIS BALLET. Sara.\n\u2022 Sadlers Wells Theatre,\nRosebury Avenue, EC1, Angel\ntube.

Looking somewhere between\nLaura Ashley and Oxfam\nbargains\u2014I donned a pair of jeans\nand a black roll-neck hoping not to\nadvertise my total un hip ness. My brief: Well, what does a rave\nlook like?\nDriving down Kingsland Road,\nEast London, you'd never know\u2014if\nyou didn't know\u2014that behind adela pi dated frontage a rave was\nhap pn in'( man). The clues are\ncars\u2014VWs and 205s and the groups\nof trendy young things strutting\ndown the road. When I arrived\nthere was a slight hitch to the event\nas there were police in their\nhundreds trying to close it down.\nBut, alas, legal loopholes saved the\nday\u2014more about that later. So, I took a deep breath and strode out.\nThere were fearsome security\nguards around who advised me to\n'grab a cup of tea and get in the\nqueue'. So I did. Tickets, which had\nto have been bought in advance\n(legal loophole No. 1), were \u00a315\nand to prevent forgery had a UV marking on them. Wow, thinks I, this is business. Now, before I go\non I must reiterate again that this is\nnot my world, nine out of ten\nSaturdays you'll find me watching\nCasualty and eating frozen lasagne.\nSo how was I to know that my,\nimagining s of lycra shorts and g art), were so out of date; 'God that was\nages ago, yeah, that was last-summer'.\nSo, having declared my body a drug and alcohol free zone and\ncame to watch others who hadn't,iI was as straight (in every sense of\nthe word) as you get.\nAnti-rave r, yesterday. '\nWe were in a warehouse of some ''\ndescription. There were three |\ndifferent rooms and a simple chart\non the wall telling people which\nroom has which DJ at what time.\nThe walls had pictures and freezes\nand projected images on them. One\nceiling had a parachute draped from\nit. Other than this and some\nimpressive lights and lasers the\nrooms were bare but for a pulse and\npulsating bodies, all dancing their\nown way. I soon saw that no one J cared what anyone else was i wearing, no one was there to pull, I everyone's dance was as good as\nanother s. Of course, there were\ndrugs, but not so much as I expected. There was some dope and\nsome speed, as far as acid and .\necstasy, no doubt it was there but\nnot half so prevalent as Inspector\nMorse would have us believe.\nDrugs were not the scene, the scene\nwas music that doesn't let you stop.\nThat's how people finish\nMarathons. The dancing itself is a high. It's switch off the world\u2014it's the bodies, the music, the lights and\nin a sense, it's a way of being 'at\none with yourself. The rooms were\nfull but somehow there was enough\nspace for everyone.\nThousands of people all dancing.\nSo I watched. Such a buzz.\nTo buy a drink you need first to\nhave bought some straws, of the\ndrinking kind from the straw lady\n(?) who sold them at \u00a31 each. It's really quite weird, but there you\nhave legal loophole No. 2. The\nwalls were dripping, the heat was\ncomforting, conversation was not\neasy (or necessary).\nWhat impressed me was the\nprofessionalism. The people behind\nthis know what people want. They\nwant to dance, they want to buy\noranges, some want to have't fier e face painted. The people who run\n' these things may not be pillars of\nmoral society but how many night\ni> clubs service the loos and put clean\n,bog roll in them at 4am.I mean,\nthey've already got our money! And\ni the drinks are about half the price\n^ of the average nightclub.\nDrugs are a big part of the scene,\n; I saw evidence of the, but it's not i full of it\u2014and if you're there until\nthe end then I'm sure some\nstimulants might help you reach\n10am on your feet. I just think\n; people want to dance, they want to\n\" party in a primal way and leave the\n' modern world behind them for a night. But a legal version of this\natmosphere wouldn't work. There's thought, planning, gro ovi neSs and\nplanning behind the whole\noperation. Nothing sinister\u2014tell\nyour folks\u2014some people know how\nto party.\nThe Rave Game\nBored with Monopoly? Well, play\nCleudo then (Hello Raggies). But\nonce that's over, what next. Want\na board game that your\ngrandmother probably won't approve of? One that Richard\nBranson definitely doesn't approve\nof? The Rave Game is here.\nOriginally released in 1991,\"the\noriginal version attracted top\nreviews and sold by the thousand.\nUntil the News Of The World got\nhold of a copy, leading to the game\nbeing banned from sale in Virgin\nand all the major games stores and\n,4 catalogues. The gan ie's creator, BP\nWow was physically ejected from\nthe Earl's Court Toy Fair last year.\n! TV advertising stopped by the IBA,\nt> on grounds that the game may\n' offend public decency. The game is\nhow\" \"remixed' in an updated\nversion. What on earth is in this\ngame?\nApart from a Jamie Hewlett\n(Tank Girl) poster, there's three\nphases to the game, involving\ncollecting flyers for the big rave\nfrom clubs around a city, followed\nby travelling around the country,\ncollecting En erg i tokens to put in\nthe players' stash bags, avoiding\nbeing busted, and finally the rave\nscene, exchanging your En erg ii tokens for dance cards, to make up\n\u2022 to a three piece psychedelic jigsaw,\nall taking place on a day g lo and\nsilver playing mat.\nThe game is available for \u00a324.99\nfrom RAVCO, PO Box 10, London\nIN l3R J.

But\nthis does not stop the accusation of\n'well, he was asking for it'. I particularity resent this attitude, if\nsomeone publishes something,\ncriticism is expected, mugging is\nnot. Surely, more intelligent ways\nof registering your disapproval can\nbe found. Still more surprising is\nthat Mr Andrew Wensley a usually\nsensitive individual should make\nhimself party to these actions, I am\nmost disappointed.\nTHES\nSTOIC have once again scaled\nnew heights of publicity seeking. In\nthis weeks 'Antithesis' column of\nthe Times Higher Educational\nFelix 957\nSupplement STOIC's pornographic\nshenanigans were reported in\ngraphic detail. Even Publications\nBoard chairman Hugh Eland was\nquoted extensively and accurately,\npouring scorn on the whole\nshem ozz le. There is still a chance\nthat STOIC will receive world\nrecognition for the extensive work\nit does.\nSabb election dates\nAs a little piece of extra emphasis\non sabbatical elections, if it were\nneeded, I will now add a list of dates\nfor all you candidates to add to your\ndiaries.\n12th Feb Artwork for printing\nto be completed by 19th Feb.\nl pm on 22nd Feb for\nManifestos for all candidates to be\nprinted in that Friday's Felix.\nNo printing can be released until\nthe 19th Feb when the Sabb election\ncampaign officially starts. After\nwhich you can wallpaper the JCR\nin pictures of your face, be nice to\nmedical students from a place you\nOpinion\n12 February 1993\nnever knew was part of Imperial\nCollege before and make your\nfriends your worst enemies. I, along\nwith the rest of the student media,\nwill make your life hell, I do not\nwish any of you luck, I wish you\njustice.\nCredits\nNews: Declan, Gareth, Jacob,\nAndrew.

Due to start at 6.30 pm\non Tuesday 23rd, the yet to be\nnamed half-hourly show aims to\ncontain all the events for the\nforthcoming week as well as the\nprevious weeks news and\ninformation. Clubs and Societies\ntake note: the publicity is totally\nFREE! Only an idiot would pass on\nthis opportunity.\nSecurity Alerts\nI am not the only one who is fed-up, no sorry., correction, pissed off\nwith the state of the London\nUnderground at the moment. Since\nlast week, South Kensington tube\nhas been closed three times at least;\nlast Wednesday (3rd), Monday\nnight (8th) and Wednesday morning\n(10th). And there was also the mass\nclosure of several stations on\nWednesday 3rd;15 at least I counted. Like many commuters, I dream of the day when there are no\nsecurity alerts, no cancelled trains,\nclean platforms (not the shoes),\nclean trains, cheap fares (this really\nIS a dream) and station announcers\nwho have excellent pronunciation.\nSex For poor perverts everywhere there\nis now the opportunity to watch 48\nhours (or there about s) of non-stop\nsex. This weekend, BBC2 and\nChannel 4 are competing for\nviewing figures in the TV sex war.\nBoth sides promise tant a lising treats\nall Saturday night and for part of\nSunday night and have recruited\nsexy, young presenters to host the\nsoft porn shows, such as Nina\nMyskow. Hmmm, can't wait!\nDracula Seen Bram Stoker's/ Francis Ford\nCoppella's Dracula yet? Don't. Read the book instead and save\nyourself the anguish of watching\nKeanu Reeves attempt an English\naccent.\nBe it Back Rag week; loveless, lifeless,\ntasteless, helpless and hopeless.\nWhy bother? That joke isn't funny\nany more!\nRag Twats\u2014who are they? First\nyear norms with a violent desire to\nbe mad, silly and part of it (part of\nanything that will accept them more\nlike). Yes, no one else would have\nthem. So a jolly good time is had\nby all at the jolly old rag office,\nRAH! RAH! FUCKIN' RAH!I kn pw! What a marvellous fund\nraising type activity it would be if\nwe got a humour less ex-public\nschool boy to dress up as a gnome\n(yes kids a gnome) and disturb\nbiology lectures for a hundred or so\nstudents trying to pass a few silly\nexams.\nOr even better\u2014go into Felix and\nphysically assault Phil (Cat's Eyes)\nDodd for a few pennies to help the\norphans! (It'sO K kids, always\nremember that the ends justify the\nmeans when you're a sad bastard).\nIt's a well known fact that there\nare no bad soldiers, just bad\nofficers. Rachel 'Rag Chair'\nMountford went wrong when she\ndidn't get a grip of her people at the\noutset. Being in charge means that\nyou are responsible, and the bullied\npublic school boys unleashed back\non society with a cause and an\nexcuse for vindictive and violent\nbehaviour should have been vetted\nout of the programme to start with.\nThey should have a little test\u2014\nhere's one we prepared earlier:\n1. Are you a first year\nMechanical Engineer with no\nfriends?\n2. Did you get constantly bog-washed and fed laxative chocolate\nat your minor public school?\n3. Do you own a Freddy\nMercury tribute concert t shirt?\n4. Are you a middle-classed\nstate school kid that felt cheated\nby having missed out on all the\nboyish public school japes like\nbeating the only black kid in the\nschool until he bleeds profuse ley from the mouth and rectum.\nNot all the Raggies are Rag Twats,\nbut there are enough to make it a big waste of time and energy for all\nof those involved for the right\nreasons.\nAs we all know, Rag raises an\nawful lot of money for charity\u2014fair\nenough. It's just the tw at brigade\nthat gets me down. The ends never\njustify the means.\nPerhaps next year we can hope\nsomething truly constructive and\nmeaningful like a sponsored\n'Morrissey Quote-a th on'. I 'll start.\n'Two lovers entwined pass me\nby, and heaven knows I'm miserable now!'\nOh! I'm fed up with this already.\nGot any Primal Scream!\nViews expressed in this article are\nnot necessarily shared by Felix or\nICU staff\nPage 3\n\n"

For it is on this\nday that a variety programme has\nbeen organised by the Pakistan\nSociety in conjunction with Pak\nSocs from other London Colleges.\nThis is the first musical event to be\nbrought into existence by the\npresent day committee, and is the\nlargest collaboration of its kind\nbetween London Pak Socs.\nThe evening is entitled Sham-e Ghazal, which simply translates to\na night of love songs. It is to be held\nin the SCR (Sherfield), with doors\nopening at 7pm. The show will start\nwith an exhibition of Pakistani\nhumour in the form of several small\ncomedy sketches performed by\nstudents from LSE and Kings\nCollege. This promises to be quite\nan experience, with much audience\nparticipation expected - you have\nbeen warned!\nHowever, the highlight of the\nevening will be a performance by\nKausar Habib, a renowned ghazal\nWhich one of the present committee\nsinger from Pakistan, accompanied\nby Agha Sarwar. Many people\nAnd help Barnardo's Raise money at the Ideal Home Exhibition\nEarls Court, London\nMarch 17th April 12th1993 by selling raffle tickets to win a car!\nHard work but great fun Contact Lesley Thompson NOW on0815508822 Barnardos\nmembers will be re-elected?\n(especially young Pakistanis) are\nunder the impression that ghazals\nare songs one sings when\ndepressed, suicidal or suffering\nfrom indigestion. This cannot be\nfurther from the truth. If you take\nsome time to listen to a ghazal,\nwithout any preconceived ideas that\nmay prejudice your judgement, I am sure you will realise that ghazals\nare beautiful pieces of Urdu\nliterature (phrases, sonnets etc.) that\nare threaded together with\nm esme rising music.\nEven if you do not understand\nUrdu, listening to the music alone\nis an unforgettable experience.\nTickets can be bought from\ncommittee members of the Pak Soc.\nPriced at \u00a34 (non-members \u00a34.50),\nthere is a limited number of tickets\navailable, so buy now to avoid\ndisappointment. Which one of the\npresent committee members will be\nre-elected?\nAfter the 20th February, a date\noutlined in my diary is the 26th February - Election Day. Anyone\ninterested in hard-work, slang ing matches, thinking-of-interesting-things-to-do, and all without much\nhope of any praise or gratitude, then\nplease contact the President so that\nnominations can be considered and\npublicised. The official election\nnomination papers will be put on the\nnotice board on Friday 19th February (that's next week!). A nominee requires a proposer and a second er, who can both preferably\nsay more than \"Vote for him/her\nbecause he/she is my best friend\".\nAll the posts on the committee are\nup for grabs, so get working on\nthose oratory skills.\nThe resident committee has decided\nto collaborate the elections with an\nIftar Dinner (the month of\nRamadan is under two week\naway!!). It is planned that the dinner\nshall be held in the Union Dining\nHall, starting at 5.20pm( approx.),\nwith the elections taking place in the\nConcert Hall immediately after\n(approx. 7pm). Surely an\nauspicious end to a year of\ntyrannical reign by Khurrum Sair\n(the resident President)!!!\nFurther details of the Iftar Dinner\nand elections can be obtained by\nreading the next issue of Paigham\n(due Friday 19th February) or\nconsulting our notice board on the\nSherfield Walkway.\nNB: To all members of the Pak Soc,\nI urge you all to attend the elections\non 26th February, as any questions\nyou may have pertaining to the\nhappenings during the past year can\nbe answered. Per chance you may\nhave any suggestions for\nimprovements, these will be noted\nby the new committee. Also any\nobjections towards nominations can\nbe reviewed, since there is no use\ncomplaining about the Pak Soc if\nyou, the members, can't be\nbothered to get involved yourselves.\nPage 8\n\n"
