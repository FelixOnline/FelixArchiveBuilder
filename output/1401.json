    "content": "One example of when to avoid Pyramids\nA few years ago, when I was a young\nand na\u00efve fresher, I was approached by\na business savvy acquaintance of mine\nconcerning a \u2018business proposition.\u2019 By\nbusiness savvy I, in fact, mean completely clueless concerning anything\npertaining to business, commerce, finance or anything at all, really. He told\nme to be at London Bridge station at\na certain time and to arrive with suit,\ntie and open mind. It all sounds very\nMafia like, and the \u2018open mind\u2019 bit implicated things I certainly wasn\u2019t sure\nabout. Scepticism and curiosity did\nbattle within me and, as usual, curiosity won the day. Not curiosity concerning whether this would be a genuine\nmoney-making scheme, but more a\ncasual interest as to what my disaster-prone friend had got himself involved\nin this time.\nSo there I was at London Bridge at\nthe appointed time, suited and booted,\nlooking sharp and feeling \u2026 less sharp.\nIn fact I was feeling distinctly blunt due\nto a protracted hangover, but I had a\nfeeling that I wasn\u2019t going to need to be\nparticularly \u2018with it\u2019 to unravel whatever harebrained scheme I was going\nto be sold.\nAfter being led through small roads\nand back-alleys we arrived at an ultra\nmodern-looking, glass building and\ntook a superfast lift to a floor with a\ndecent view of London. We then proceeded through an atrium which was\nfilled with other punters and their\n\u2018introducers\u2019 (the term for people like\nmy friend who had proposed others\nfor this event). Light chatter could\nbe heard throughout the room and\nthere was a sense of growing anticipa-tion. Anytime anyone decided to ask a\nquestion pertaining to the upcoming\nschedule, they were basically told to\n\u2018wait and see.\u2019 The thought struck me\nthat the whole thing had the feel of a\nmodern cult, and that wasn\u2019t the last\ntime I had that feeling.\nHaving built the tension sufficiently,\nthe introducers ushered us into a grand\nlecturing hall. The crowds surged forwards and found their allocated seats.\nEach punter was flanked on either side\nby either his own introducer or the in-troducer of another, so there was no\npossibility of discussion with other un-informed. The introducers themselves\nwere, of course, as tight-lipped as be-fore. It was time for the presentation. A\nslick, well-rehearsed presentation was\ngiven to whip the crowd into excite-ment. The applause was lead, naturally,\nby the introducers. I realised about ten\nminutes into the Powerpoint slideshow\nAhran Arnold\nTravel Editor\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel\nTravel Editors \u2013 Ahran Arnold and Nadine Richards\nthat there was almost no information\nbeing presented. It was just a list of\nstuff people liked. \u201cDo you like money\nand holidays? \u2026 well that\u2019s what we\u2019re\noffering and all you have to do is sign\nup with a minimal fee\u201d was the general\ngist of the deluge.\nThe way in which this was put forward was ridiculously over the top.\nShowers of rapturous applause poured\nforth after every single amount of money was put up on the mammoth screen.\nThe presenter, who was a combination\nof circus-master and evangelist, gave a\nlife story about how his life had been\ndragged from the gutter of alcoholism\nand drug abuse by this offer. It goes\nwithout saying that he claimed he received no commission for delivering\nthis talk. He just wanted to spread the\nmessage, for the benefit of everyone\n(in a secret meeting hall, on an invite\nonly basis\u2026 yes, this is when the \u2018cult\u2019\nthought appeared in my head again).\nAnyway let me cut to the chase. AfWe rightly shun pyramid schemes but aren\u2019t all of us part of the\nbiggest one of all... probably not\nShould you trust a man in a suit? Not if he looks like one of this pair.\nThese elusive scammers are still on the run\nter the audience were sent into a frenzy\nby his tirade of promises, a few details\nemerged. You pay about a grand now\nand then you recruit people to do the\nsame thing you do and get a cut of their\nfee each time. When they recruit more\npeople, you get a cut of the fee of their\nfee too. And thus your fortune builds!\nWhat if you\u2019re rubbish at recruiting or\nyou\u2019re a loser and have no friends? No\nworries! Here\u2019s the extra carrot dangled in front of you: discount holidays!\nWoohoo!! (I bet you are beginning to\nsee the relevance of this long winded\nstory now, eh?) Supposedly regardless\nof how many people you have recruited you get great deals on 5* hotels.\nSo it exposed itself as a pyramid\nscheme (which I inferred partly fro\nthe fact that the sales pitcher was at\npains to state that it was not a pyramid\nscheme) and I convinced my friend to\nget out of it while he still could. About\na year later on \u2018Watchdog\u2019, I saw an undercover reporter\u2019s secretly filmed report of the very same presentation I\u2019d\nbeen to. The whole thing had been exposed and was being dealt with in the\ncourts. These so-called 5* hotels were\nactually very dodgy, almost deserted,\nbelow 1* hostels (which people only\ndiscover on arrival).\nThe sad fact is that this sort of\nthing is incredibly common. Pyramid\nschemes have been around for a long\ntime of course, the great Albanian\npyramid scheme caused people to sell\ntheir homes to invest and farmers sold\ntheir livestock. The other aspect of this\nparticular scheme was the idea of the\n\u2018Travel Club\u2019: Some kind of arrangement whereby investment results in\ndiscounted travel deals. This has been\nseen in other incarnations eg. The\n\u2018Travel Agents Card\u2019 \u2013 the idea being\nthat travel agents get incredible trade\ndeals on flights, and all you need to\ndo to prove you are a travel agent is to\nbrandish a \u00a3500 card at an airport flight\ndesk. Go ahead and invest if you enjoy\npaying to be laughed out of airports.\nSo Felix Travel has taught you how\nto haggle and is now teaching you what\nscams you\u2019re likely to come up against.\nThe Times has in fact recently published a list of the thirteen \u2018best\u2019 travel\nscams, which can be viewed on their\nwebsite if you search for travel scams.\nIt is well worth taking a look at before\nyou decide to shop for or go on holi-days. They range from the stupid to the\ndownright malicious. Unlicensed taxis\ncan obviously have the worst outcomes\n(kidnapped, killed etc.) and should be\navoided at all costs, whereas the following scam made me laugh. If you\nwatch the \u2018Real Hustle\u2019 (by far the best\nprogramme on BBC3) you will know\nthat the best cons rely on the inherent\ngreed of human nature. This particular one, featured on the list, is no ex-ception. You\u2019re approached in a bar or\nwherever and offered to get in on a big\nscam. All you do is get on a bus-tour\nthe next day and the guys you\u2019re speaking too will drive up in front of it and\nreverse into it. You, along with all the\nother passengers who are all in on it,\nthen demand compensation for injury,\nwhich the bus company will be forced\nto provide. You provide these characters with a fixing fee of about \u00a3250 in\nadvance, which is pittance compared\nto the thousands of pounds you\u2019ll be\nreceiving in compensation. You then\nenjoy a completely safe and problem-free bus tour and realise you\u2019ve been\nduped!\nOther scams don\u2019t rely on greed but\ninstead rely on naivety and the general\nfeeling of disorientation upon arrival\nin a strange land. Some friends of mine\nhad an extremely unfortunate experience in Cuba when they were ap-proachedbyanunscrupulouscon-artist\nwho convinced them to exchange their\nmoney with a guy he knew, since the\nbanks would all be closed due to a fes-tival. They went along with this, needing the local currency. They found out\nlater that the \u2018excellent exchange\u2019 they\nhad been offered was actually nowhere\nnear the actual exchange rate and they\nhad been conned out of a lot of money.\nThese unfortunate travellers were also\ncaught up in another incident later in\nthe same trip. Some men boarded their\nbus with video cameras for \u2018security\u2019\npurposes\u2019 and then ransacked their\nbelongings later while they slept using\nthe video footage to pinpoint exactly\nwhere their stuff was.\nThe fact is there will always be people trying to con you out of your money and belongings when you travel and\nwhen you\u2019re thinking about buying\na holiday. If you want to completely\navoid it then lock yourself in a bunker for the rest of your life (I hope you\nenjoy board games). However if you\nwant to get out there and experience\nwhat the world has to offer then it\u2019s all\nabout risk management. Be wary and\nvigilant, research countries before you\nvisit them and don\u2019t be greedy and perhaps most importantly: don\u2019t let being\nconned ruin your holiday. Happy trav-elling! If you have any stories about being conned on holiday or when trying\nto buy flights or hotel stays etc. then\nsend them to Felix Travel (ftravel@\nic.ac.uk) we may print a compendium\nof them soon!\n22 felix Friday 2 May 2008\n\u201cThere will\nalways be\npeople trying to\ncon you out of\nyour money\u201d\nThe type of pyramid you shouldn\u2019t avoid\n\n"

The grass is still standing proud despite the vast\nintrusion; more marquees are due to return later this term which\nwe await with mounting excitement\nLIVE.CGCU.NET\nCalls for mass disaffiliation\nafter NUS reformation fails\nThe National Union of Students (NUS)\nAnnual Conference was held this year\nin Blackpool, with Imperial sending\nnine elected delegates. After rejoining\nthe NUS last year, Imperial was hoping\nthat there would be signs of change in\nthe NUS, that the reforms passed last\nDecember would get the two-thirds\nmajority ratification needed this time\nround and give the NUS a new lease of\nlife.\nWith 717 votes required for the reform to be passed, only 692 voted in fa-vour, meaning that the reform failed by\nonly 25 votes. Although the nine Imperial delegates were mandated to vote\nfor the reform, Camilla Royle decided\nto break mandate and voted with the\n\u2018Student Respect\u2019 line who opposed the\nratification. This was not however an\nisolated incident, as several delegates\nfrom other unions chose to break man-date, with these few votes making the\ndifference between the reform being\npassed and calls of mass disaffiliation.\nUniversities such as Imperial, King\u2019s\nand University College London, which\nhave been branded as being on the NUS\n\u2018rich list\u2019 due to the fact that they contribute the most to affiliations costs,\nhave brought up the prospect of dis-affiliation. This would be a huge blow\nto the NUS as they would lose several hundreds of thousands of pounds\nevery year, as well as losing some of\ntheir most influential and prestigious\nuniversities. Petitions are already underway at Imperial and it seems almost\ncertain that a referendum will be called\nthis term.\nOther policies considered focused\non education, with the NUS deciding\nto lobby for enforced education up to\nthe age of 18. This was opposed by Imperial as they wanted more efforts to\nbe made to offer viable alternatives and\nencourage students to stay in education voluntarily. The other big motion\nof the conference was with regards to\nthe National Bursary Scheme which\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor-in-Prowling\nwould see money for bursaries being\nallocated by the government. Imperial\nCollege Union opposed this as they\nfeel that the money will not be spread\nproportionally to their own students.\nImperial were generally poorly received at the conference with Imperial College Union President Stephen\nBrown, as well as the ICU delegates,\nbeing heckled as \u2018Tories\u2019 and \u2018RightWing Sabbaticals\u2019. The best example of\nthis can be seen in a video of Stephen\nBrown\u2019s speech where he questioned\nwhether demonstrations were the best\nuse of the NUS\u2019s dwindling resources.\nThe general opinion of the NUS\nseems to be that the students have lost\ncontrol, with too much bickering between its members and with several of\nthem suggesting that the entire process is no longer democratic. If the NUS\nis truly going to be a voice of the stu-dents, it needs to get it\u2019s act together,\nand quickly, or face a rebellion from\nit\u2019s most powerful and influential constituent members.\nICU President Stephen Brown giving his \u2018Marxist debating club on\nwheels\u2019 speech at the NUS conference\n\n"

I would feel like\nI had completely lost touch with the\ncool music being played on the radio,\nand which all the cool kids were listening to. I would change my car radio to\nBBC2, feeling that is all I deserved, so\nout of touch was I with popular mu-sic, while despondently inspecting my\nhairline in the rear-view mirror for\nsigns of recession. I am not, however, a\n40-anything. I am in fact 19 years old.\nI am currently a member of the much\ncourted 18-30s demographic, the precise demographic which decides who\nor what is hot, and which or where is\nnot. I therefore assert that, rather than\nme not understanding why The Long\nBlondes count as good music, I know\nthat the Long Blondes in fact make\nbad music. Dull, generic, derivative,\nunoriginal, uninspiring boring fucking\nmusic. The colour and texture of wallpaper paste, but without the practical\nuse. Just like a pale greyish mass. Well\nnot grey, kind of a greyish maroon.\nUm, so anyway, I went to see The\nLong Blondes last term at The Amersham Arms. Earlier on in the evening,\nI had been fortunate enough to have\nlargely avoided any exposure with\nsaid Long Blondes, other than a bit of\nYouTubing before I went to the show,\nso I arrived open-minded and ready to\nembrace the group\u2019s collective creative\ntalents. Almost as soon as the show\nstarted, it became fairly obvious that\nthere was very little creative talent to\nembrace. Consisting almost entirely\nof 80s throwbacks, from the saturated\nguitar twangs, to the glam-punk style\nof the songs, even down to the performance mannerisms of lead vocalist\nKate Jackson (look left, pout, rotate\nshoulders forwards, rotate shoulders\nbackwards, repeat), The Long Blondes\nseem lost in the collective styles of\ntheir musical influences, themselves\nbringing little to the scene except a\nconglomerated discography of ironic\n80s disco trash that people pretended\nto like a couple of years ago when it\nwas cool.\nThe one single, solitary redeeming\nfeature of the night was the performance of \u2018Giddy Stratospheres\u2019, the last\nshow of the gig, which is actually a\npretty good song. Well, to be more pre-cise, it\u2019s got a funky chorus. To be even\nmore precise, there was one chord\nchange in the chorus that was pretty\ngood. I wish I were joking. Have a lis-ten, you\u2019ll see what I mean.\nSo an all-round disappointment. Do\nnot go and see the Long Blondes unless you want to pay to be bored all\nevening. They released a new album\n\u2018Couples\u2019 on the 7th of April, but you\nprobably shouldn\u2019t buy it, and they\nare on tour all over Europe and North\nAmerica until the beginning of June,\nbut you probably shouldn\u2019t go.\nPeter Sinclair Kate Jackson making her best attempt at eating the mic\nPart two: It doesn\u2019t get much better\nThe Long Blondes\nCouples\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nTeamed with DJ Erol Alkan, The Long\nBlondes are back with their troublesome second album, \u2018Couples\u2019.\nIn difficult, second album style,\nthe Blondes have chosen to begin by\nchanging their sound with some self-indulgent electro. Sure it still has the\nKate Bush influences, but they\u2019re the\nbad, bland parts. The instrumental\nsounds like the demo on a cheap Casio\nkeyboard. The problem is, it\u2019s meant\nto sound like that which just makes it\neven more grating. It\u2019s called \u2018Century\u2019,\nwhich is fitting, as the song is so boring\nit seems like it lasts that long. To make\nmatters worse, it is their first single.\nWhere has the punk gone? Where has\nthe half-decent taste in music gone?\nErol Alkan, you\u2019ve got a lot to answer\nfor. \u2018Guilt\u2019 (has nothing to do with it) is\nthe title of track two and probably had\nsomething to do with chucking that\ncrap Casio keyboard out and reverting\nback to a slightly more familiar sound.\nFamiliar for a Girls Aloud single, that\nis.\nPredictably, the production is far\nsharper than the debut album. I think\nmost people would rather listen to\nthe grit of \u2018Lust in the Movies\u2019 any day\nthough. Even the most anthemic of\nsongs are polished up like a bimbo\u2019s\nnails. How Kate Jackson manages to\nmake a chant sound glam I just don\u2019t\nknow (\u2018Here Comes the Serious Bit\u2019).\nShe could sing Ave Maria and still\nsomehow make it sound sexy.\nAs well as a DJ producer it seems\nlike they\u2019ve nicked Pulp\u2019s keyboardist in certain aspects. Well they certainly ain\u2019t having Jarvis. \u2018Round the\nHairpin\u2019 could be a B-side on a Pulp\nsingle, except it is more soft porn than\nhardcore.\nIt comes across as though this band\nare trying to emulate their idols, rather\nthan doing what they\u2019re good at - being\nthemselves. \u2018Erin O\u2019Connor\u2019 is another\nindie disco number which will no doubt\nbe a single, but it is everything that\nBlondie has already done before (nice\ngrimey guitar though). Then there\u2019s\n\u2018Too Clever By Half\u2019, an understated\nfalsetto number that should have been\nleft to a hidden track, and \u2018Nostalgia\u2019 is\nonly worth listening to because it uses\nthe word \u2018breakfast\u2019 - an under-used\nmeal in love songs.\nHowever we do end this disappointing album with a lovely lyric \u201cI\u2019m going\nto hell so I may as well make it worth\nmy while\u201d. But come to think of it,\n\u2018lovely\u2019 shouldn\u2019t really be an adjective\nfor a song about going to hell though,\nshould it? It sounds more like a little girl cheekily admitting she\u2019s been\nthrowing out the fruit her mummy\nputs in her lunchbox and eating penny\nchews instead. It\u2019s hardly hell-raising\nand the 50s rock \u2018n\u2019 roll style piano\ndoesn\u2019t exactly help the situation.\nThe Long Blondes tried to do something a little different with \u2018Couples\u2019\nbut got cautious after only the first\ntrack. They\u2019ve accessorised their sound\nrather than having a complete makeo-ver. Minus the dire opening, any die\nhard Long Blondes fan should probably listen to this album, but the rest of\nus would do better to steer clear.\nLara O\u2019Reilly\nThe Long Blondes looking less terrible than above\nThey may not have much talent, but The Long Blondes certainly have a new album.\nWhat\u2019s more, they are on tour to pimp it. Music Felix braced our ears and had a listen\nA\ns a heterosexual male,\nit is a rare and notable\nevent when I fall in love\nwith a man. It is an even\nrarer event when I fall in\nlove with a man through the medium\nof podcast. But that is this strange situation I found myself in over the Easter\nholidays when I discovered that my favourite radio DJ, Gilles Peterson, heretofore subjected to the crematorium of\ngraveyard slots from 2:00 until 4:00am\non a Thursday morning on Radio 1,\nhas his own podcast service \u2013 Gilles\nPeterson Worldwide. This is probably\nthe sweetest musical discovery I have\nmade since I got creepily into hip-hop\na few years ago.\nFor those not in the know, Gilles Peterson is a giant of the slightly left-field\njazz/funk/soul/latin scene (as well as a\nDJ and owner of Brownswood Recordings), doing more to bring that kind of\nmusic to a popular audience than any\nother DJ on mainstream radio. Granted, there are other DJs who play jazz on\nthe radio, but no-one I know of does\nit with more passion. Even when interviewing guests on the show, it\u2019s always\njust as interesting hearing Gilles asking the questions and getting into his\nelement, spouting facts and knowledge\nabout Japanese latin artists or Australian dubstep nights. I have heard\nrumours that he had to move out of\nhis house because he had too many\nrecords, and now stores them in a pur-pose-built warehouse. Introduced to\nthe show by a friend a few years ago, I\nhave fucked up far too many Thursdays\nstaying up all night to listen to it. The\ndiscovery of this podcast virtually represents an additional day in my week.\nA 1/7-fold improvement!\nThis is all so new to me. Podcasts\nhave been around for years, but I\u2019ve\nonly just started to bother about them.\nWhy wasn\u2019t I told? They are such a\ngreat way of keeping up with new music if you are too lazy or don\u2019t have\nthe time to do it for yourself, making\nthem a lifeline during long library eve-nings. Most labels will have some kind\nof service showcasing their new acts\nand releases, but far from being just\na new advertising platform, they have\nthe feeling of going back to the roots\nof what music is about and why these\nlabels are around in the first place, in\na music business where their pre-em-inent status is definitely coming into\nquestion. They too are lovers of great\nmusic. They don\u2019t just want your mon-ey, they want your mind.\nAnyway, this week we\u2019ve got a double\nfeature of Long Blondes music. They\nreleased an album \u2018Couples\u2019 a few of\nweeks ago, so we listened to that and\nwe went to a show. I can\u2019t help but think\nbands like that live in an emperor\u2019snew-clothes dream world - as long as\nthey keep raking in the pounds, dollars\nand yen, they can put out whatever the\nfuck music they want. So read about\nthat and some other stuff too.\nWe got a shitload of CDs sent to\nus over the holidays, and there\u2019s\nalways gigs that need going to. If\nyou fancy getting some free stuff,\ngive us an email at music.felix@\ngmail.com.\nJAMES HOUGHTON\n\n"

Leonardo knows,\nand his sketch even includes a tiny cow\nfoetus in the shape of a fully formed\nminiature cow. Awww bless.\nLeonardo also had to concentrate\non his day job as a very famous artist,\nso we get to see some of his sketches\nfor various commissions. He sketches\nhorses from all positions with various\nmuscles tensed, like a gym rat flexing\nin the mirror. His sketches of kittens\nplaying are wonderfully lively, but we\nalso see his train of thought as across\nthe page, kittens turn into miniature\ndragons. See if you can spot them.\nLeonardo was using feline movement to imagine how dragons would\nmove, possibly for a commission for a\n\u2018George and the Dragon\u2019 themed piece.\nLeonardo really did think outside the\nRenaissance box.\nI could have stayed in that room for-ever, but it was time to move on to the\nnext. The corridor between the two\nrooms displays an old map surveyed\nin 1752. America looks very odd\u2026 The\ncartographer has added bits here and\nthere which make North America look\nlike The Elephant Man. The presence\nof the map in the passage between the\ntwo rooms of the exhibition is very\nsignificant as we pass from the 16th to\nthe 18th Century. Time has passed and\nmuch has changed. Welcome to the\nage of the Gentleman Gardener.\nThe difference between the two\nparts of the exhibition is stark. Whereas with old Leonardo you stood in awe\nand amazement to marvel at his talent,\nthis next part gives you the opportunity to have a giggle at some weird and\nwonderful creatures and, sometimes,\nthe way they are portrayed. Some of\nthese guys struggle with the concept\nof scale!\nYou first come across a sloth. But\nhang on... It\u2019s the wrong way up! Sloths\nare usually found hanging upside-down, completely stoned off their\nfaces from consuming cannabinoid-containing leaves. This unidentified\nartist obviously worked from a preserved specimen and just presumed\nit stood on all fours, showing the innocence of one seeing a species for\nthe first time. The drawings with this\ntheme are all quite entertaining as the\nartists struggle to catalogue the influx\nof new species brought in by explorers\nfrom exotic lands. Art and science are\nclearly coming together now for a solid\npurpose. Among these drawings is one\nof an African Civet, known throughout\nhistory for its smelly poo. The artist\ntherefore shows the civet\u2019s anal glands\nvery prominently, perhaps exaggerating them for educational reasons or\njust for a laugh.\nI came across a wonderful selection\nof fruit drawings. They are accompanied with a brilliant quote: \u201cWe are\nhorrified by monstrosities in humans,\nbut we love them in fruit\u201d. Quite so.\nThe piece entitled \u2018Lemon\u2019 (my new favourite insult) shows a mutilated lemon which has grown finger-like protru-sions. This is the stuff of dreams, or the\nSo here we have \u2018The Star of Bethlehem\u2019, all swirly and swishy like it\u2019s underwater, one of the 600 Leonardo Da Vinci pieces our beloved Queen\nhas tucked away at Buckingham Palace. In my flat I have... zero Leonardo da Vincis. That\u2019s not fair. She should share them round a bit\nWaitrose organic section!\nThe rest of the exhibition is just\nflowers. Alexander Marshal is one of\nthe four featured artists of the exhi-bition. He was an amateur enthusiast who walked the earth in the 17th\nCentury portraying plants with sharp\ndetail and beauty. I thought his drawings were really touching as he drew\nwith such love for the subject matter.\nI really like \u2018Crocuses, anemones and\njay\u2019 where he has drawn the flowers as\nusual and then he had stuck a dead jay\nat the bottom of the sheet so it looked\nlike it had just fallen onto the page of\nflowers. Marshal also spreads his love\nto the insect world where he draws insects and dragonflies fluttering across\nhis page, sticking their delicate spiral\ntongues out at me.\nIt is quite a shock at the end of the\nsmall exhibition to be cast out of the\nquiet A.R.T. gallery and into the gold\nsplendour of the \u2018Treasures\u2019 gallery. It\ntook me an hour or less to have a look\nat Amazing Rare Things so I recommend having a good coo over all those\njewels too. If you haven\u2019t felt too cheated by the admission fee, have a look in\nthe shop. There is a host of dainty bits\nand bobs to tickle your fancy!\nAmazing Rare Things is for everyone,\nbut especially you zoologists, botanists\nand amateur explorers. It adds a touch\nof the exotic to your grey, London day,\nso get in there, you lemon!\nAmazing Rare Things is on until\n28th September so you have no\nexcuse to miss it. It costs \u00a37.50\nfor entry into the Queen\u2019s Gallery\nwhich includes this exhibition,\na fabulous audio guide and all\nthe other galleries showcasing\nHer Majesty\u2019s fist-sized jewels,\nFaberge eggs, and priceless\nworks of art\u2026 An absolute\nbargain.\nThe eternal debate that is alligator vs snake. I\u2019m not convinced the artist was working from life on this one. I doubt he\u2019d have stuck around, pencil at the ready, to find out who won\n\n"

As we approach the more summery months of our annual cycle, the\ncries of unbridled delight at the first\nsights of sunny weather is immediately\ncrushed by the thought of demon-ised torture (or exams, as others call\nit). Whilst exam season is upon us, it\nmeans wasting entire days inside. With\nthe British summer being the length\nof Wotsit most years, there\u2019s only one\nthing to make the most of it, and that\u2019s\nheading off into the countryside, scaring some sheep with loud rock music\nand drinking several local villages dry\nof their booze. Festivals have become\na mainstay of an event of my last few\nsummers, and a change in my schedule isn\u2019t looking likely for 2008.When\nRage Against The Machine decided\nthey were going to reform and play at\nReading Festival this year, I\u2019m not sure\nwhat would have stopped me from getting my \u00a3165 ticket of pure joy. Nothing did stop me; in fact, I got a little\nbit too excited and ended up with six\ntickets. Thank the gods of Natwest for\ntheir student overdrafts.\nIts not just Reading and Leeds that\nwillbeinvadedbythousandsoffestival-goers this year. Glastonbury is back on\nthe 27th-29th of June, Rosklide in Denmark in early July, and with California\u2019s\nmassive super-festival Coachella just\ngone in April, festival season has now\nofficially commenced.\nMusic, entertainment and intoxicated (we\u2019re not saying which intoxicant\u2026s) antics aside, festivals entail\nrealms of eccentricity when it comes\ndown to clothes. \u2018Anything-goes\u2019 fashion is the only way of really describing\nwhat you might expect to see people\nwearing at a festival. Personal experience tells me wearing a wedding dress\nwhilst watching Metallica is actually a\nlittle disturbing, but it didn\u2019t occur at\nthe time.\nFestival clothing needs to strike a\nbalance between style and practical-ity. You may look awesome, but if you\ncome home with severe heat stroke,\nMummy and Daddy won\u2019t be too\npleased will they? There are many factors you need to consider before packing your bags for the festival, and obviously the weather is major one.\nSo, you\u2019re going to need layers. Both\nyou and the weather will be smoking\nhot during the day, but don\u2019t forget\nyou\u2019re camping in the middle of a field\nand it will be get surprisingly nippy as\nnight falls. Oh, there\u2019s also a chance\nof it turning into a classic Glastostyle mudfest. Be prepared, as the Boy\nScouts say, or was it the SAS? I never\nremember.\nMy personal favourite, and the one\nthing I always end up wearing are\nhoodies. Whether its raining, boiling\nor freezing, a zip-up hoody is an awesome piece of festival clothing. Check\nout American Apparel\u2019s or Topman\u2019s\nranges of block-coloured zip up hood-ies that can be worn by both boys and\ngirls. Solid, bold colours are still good\nto wear, whilst simple patterns such\nas thick stripes seem to be making a\ncomeback after a short hiatus.\nI\u2019m going to guess floral-print dresses will be popular at festivals this year,\nand expect to see hordes of girls in the\nsame Topshop ones. For something\na little different (but admittedly not\nall that much), try Urban Outfitters\u2019\nrange of floral-print summer dresses.\nThe most common pieces of vintage\nclothing, and hence most easily found,\nare dresses. For those concerned\nSpending three days in the sun and mud: Vintage dresses (right) and floral dresses (left) will be featuring\nheavily this summer\u2019s festivals\nabout looking like a high-street clone,\nhere\u2019s your chance to show off some\nindividuality. I\u2019m really digging the\nwhole 1950s-housewife look. An\nawesome vintage twist to a summery\ndress which might be a bit too flamboyant on the streets, but fitting for a\nfestival.\nThe best places to look out for vintage dresses are in markets; sadly no\nmore Camden (and not just because of\nthe fire). Portobello Market in Notting\nHill will inevitable have a lot of vintage\nclothing on offer, but an acceptable\nprice for a 30 year-old dress may come\ninto question. Otherwise, try local retro and vintage clothing shops, such as\nBeyond Retro or Blue Rinse.\nCropped trousers, as I predicted\nat the start of this year, will be big\namongst the more alternative crowd;\nthe exact crowds that make up the majority of British festivals. The ankle-ex-posing garment will inevitably become\nmore popular at the weather gets more\nreliably summery, and actually have a\npractical use to them when using the\ndisease-ridden cesspit the festival organizers call the toilets. Since there\u2019s\nnothing to drag through the grotty\ntoilets at your ankles, cropped trousers guarantee a lesser-so degree of an\nodour-laden tent.\nShorts are also making a return.\nThree quarter lengths are out, and tailored above knee length is in.\nWellington boots are classic festival wear, and not only are they great\nfor keeping your feet dry (seriously\ngirls and guys, keep your feet dry at all\ntimes at a festival), they do a good job\nof \u2018bottling\u2019 My Chemical Romance,\nor other equivalently unpopular acts.\nFunky patterned wellies with flowing\nsummery dresses are the way to go for\nlasses. Other than waterproof foot-wear, hi-top Converse are ideal for the\nstresses and strains of jumping up and\ndown like a pill-popping kangaroo to\nyour favourite bands. They\u2019re pretty\nmuch certain to stay on your feet even\nin the most rib-cage crushingly large\ncrowds. Losing your footwear at an\nindoor gig is bad enough, just imagine\nthe size of the task of retrieving your\nfootwear at a festival; before you know\nit, your shoe will probably be headed\nfor Gerard Way\u2019s face anyway. For any\nMy Chemical Romance fans out there,\nI\u2019m sorry, but you should also be subject to a severe beating by delinquent\nshoes.\nThough festivals can be a chance to\nimpress, it doesn\u2019t really matter what\nyou look like; as long as you have the\nmost fun you\u2019ve ever had in your life.\nI know saying that appears hypocritical after telling you what to wear at one\nfor the last thousand words or so, but\nfestivals are a chance to wear anything\nyou want without disapproving ques-tioning, or even worse, being arrested\nfor indecent exposure. I\u2019ll see you lot\nat Reading.\nFestival wear for 2008: Red and white plaid shirt (Urban Outfitters) twinned with white smart shorts (Topman) and rockabilly sunglasses. The retro look for girls with a candy dress\n(vintage) and black 1950s style sunglasses (Urban Outfitters). Rose themed wellington boots also make a pretty addition when things get a bit soggy\n15\nFriday 2 May 2008 felix\n\n"

But it's not entirely without risk...\nTim Sands\nIf your love life is somewhat in the\ndoldrums at the moment, take heart,\nthings could always be worse. New research has shown that one species of\nfish has gone without sex for 70,000\nyears.\nThe Amazon Molly, a small fish living in rivers in Texas and Mexico, consists entirely of females and reproduces\nby parthenogenesis \u2013 literally \u201cvirgin\nbirth\u201d \u2013 laying eggs that are unfertilised and genetically identical to their\nmother.\nThis means of reproduction comes\nwith some serious drawbacks. When\nthere are mutations with harmful ef-fects, sexual reproduction allows these\nto be weeded out but asexually reproducing species, like the Molly, are\nstuck with them. These bad mutations\ncontinue to accumulate \u2013 a process\nknown as Muller's Ratchet \u2013 and as a\nresult asexual species rarely last very\nlong before they go extinct.\nThe curious fish species (the first\nknown single-sex vertebrate) formed\nby the merger of two other species,\nrendering sex impossible and starting\nthe Muller's Ratchet effect. The new\nresearch has used this effect to estimate that the Amazon Molly has been\nwithout sex for between 40,000 and\n100,000 years \u2013 even longer than Cliff\nRichard.\nThe scientists, from the Universities of Edinburgh and Wuerzburg, who\nhave been studying the species are baffled at how they have remained chaste\nfor so long. Their calculations also\nsuggest that the Molly is at great risk\nof going extinct. Another curious facet\nof their reproduction may give a clue\nto their survival. Although the Molly\ndoes not need males to fertilise their\neggs they can't get by entirely with out\nthem. The eggs need the sperm of oth-er, closely related species to give them\na mechanical stimulus to start their\ndevelopment.\nThe researchers suggest that on rare\noccasions these sperm may actually\nfertilise the eggs. Researcher Laurence\nLoewe of Edinburgh University says\n\u201cThe Amazon molly must be employing tricks to avoid extinction. Maybe\nthere is still occasional sex with strangers that keep the species alive. Future\nresearch may give us some answers.\u201d\nThis occasional cross-species nookie\ncould give the fishes' genome just\nthe sprucing up it needs to stave off\nextinction.\nDue to the complexity of the calculations involved in coming up with these\nestimates, the scientists enlisted the\nuse of a distributed computing system\n\u2013 not unlike the SETI@home experiments that searches for alien life \u2013 appropriately enough called Evolution@\nhome, to simulate the genetic changes\nover many thousands of generations\nThe writer Irina Dunn once claimed\nthat a woman needs a man like a fish\nneeds a bicycle \u2013 for the Amazon Molly at least it seems she wasn't far off the\ntruth.\nThe research is published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.\nAmazon Mollies do it... well, they don't, in fact. Haven't for the last 70,000 years, apparently. Apart from\nsuspected \"occasional sex with strangers\" (other, related, fish species) it seems they live up to their name\nA recent poll, collectively carried\nout by USA Today, the Kaiser Family\nFoundation and the Harvard School of\nPublic Health, has revealed that 40% of\nAmericans have difficulty affording essential prescriptive medicine.\nThe nationally representative telephone survey of 1695 adults, aged 18\nor over, was undertaken in January of\nthis year in the United States. Half of\nthe participants were found to regularly take at least one medication.\nThe research concluded that the\nhigh cost of prescriptive medicine has\nserious implications with 29% of individuals not filing a prescription due to\nthese high prices and around 23% cutting pills in half or skipping doses in order to make their medication last for a\nlonger period of time. This can potentially lead to a considerably increased\nhealth risk as a result of the vital drug\ntreatment not being administered.\nThe pharmaceutical trade is unar-guably a multi-billion dollar industry.\nThe use of prescriptive medicine is ex-tensive, with half of all adults taking at\nleast one prescription drug daily. Eight\nin ten Americans concur that the cost\noftheseprescriptiondrugsisunreason-able \u2013 a large proportion questioning\nthe pharmaceutical companies\u2019 motivation and their overpowering concern\nwith revenue. The study found there to\nbe mixed opinion with regards to the\npharmaceutical companies themselves\n\u2013 47% favourably viewing the indus-try. They are considered to carry out\ntheir research complying with ethical\nand moral regulations, with the testing and monitoring of drug production\nbelieved to be at a high standard, as\nwould be expected.\nA slightly lower percentage of the\npublic, 44%, view the companies in a\nnegative light. Making a comparison\nacross the professions, they are viewed\nas faintly more favourable than health\ninsurers but are held in substantially\nlower esteem than doctors.\nDespite this attitude being shared by\nmany people, there is a clear optimistic consensus that drug developments\nover the past 20 years have improved\nthe lives of people in the States. In a\nnumber of cases their availability has\nreduced the need for expensive medical procedures and/or hospitalisation.\nThere are clearly implausible benefits\nfrom prescriptive medication, which is\nhighly valued.\nOver the years, the progress made in\nscientific research and development is\noutstanding. This is not contestable.\nThe problem lies in affordability; resulting in many calling for stricter gov-Pills, pills, pretty pills. But the cost makes them bitter to swallow, and gilding certainly won't help that...\nernmental regulation to place a limitation on the individual has to pay for\nrequired medicine.\nThis poll was the third in a series of\npolls conducted by USA Today/Kaiser\nFamily/Harvard.

In principle the NUS is a brilliant organisation.\nWhich one of us doesn\u2019t have an interest in a well-run, respected, effective\nnational lobbying voice dedicated to\nachieving positive changes on our be-half? For decades the NUS by its own\nadmission has not fulfilled this role\nand this year a reform package was\nproposed that fell tantalisingly short\nof being approved. The situation now\nis that Unions like ours which were\nkeen to see the organisation change\nare faced with the choice of spending\nanother year attempting to change an\norganisation which in its current form\nis described by the NUS President elect\nas \u201cnot worth saving\u201d.\nNUSConference2008sawthereform\npackage rejected and now the NUS is\nfaced with spending another year having another debate with students as to\nwhat its own internal structures should\nbe.IfweremainNUSaffiliateswewillbe\nspending tens of thousands of pounds\nfor next year\u2019s President to take part in\nthe same boring, mindnumbing constitutional squabble that I have devoted\nconsiderable time to this year with no\nguarantee of success. Following NUS\nConference I remained hopeful that a\nsolution could be found this year but it\nhas now been confirmed that this will\nnot happen. From the NUS\u2019s perspective they are now in roughly the same\nposition they were this time last year.\nThe NUS claims it wants to reform but\nfollowing the failure to do so this year I\nhave serious doubts as to whether this\ncan happen within a reasonable time\nframe, if at all.\nOur 9 delegates to NUS Conference gave up 3 days of their lives to\ntry and change NUS for the better but\nhave returned severely disillusioned.\nQuestions are now being raised as to\nwhether the \u00a346,000 could be better\nspent within our own Union and investigating other possible structures\nfor national representation.\nChanging the way the NUS operates\nwould have gone a long way to preventing the financial mismanagement\nand political inadequacy that it has\nsuffered from in the past. The NUS has\nlost money every year this century and\nhas had to sell assets to meet running\ncosts. In the medium term it will lead\nto the organisation going bankrupt.\nFinancial problems aside the NUS,\nlike countless other collective organi-sations, currently amplifies extreme\nleft wing voices. These voices drown\nout the views of normal students who\nwant to study hard and look to their\nStudents\u2019 Union to provide services,\nopportunities and representation that\nis relevant to their student experience.\nThe NUS will tell you that they also\nshare these goals but unfortunately the\nthings we care about are often pushed\naside by political activists with revolutionary aspirations who think that having the NUS there to act as their irrelevant mouthpiece is their God-given\nright. Now I am a live and let live sort\nof guy but whilst Imperial College Union is bankrolling this farce I think it is\nright that we should be questioning the\nmerits of this reality.\nPlease be assured that any contact the\npriorities of the NUS has with reality is\nonly tangential. Despite the organisation being in crisis it found the time\nsince Annual Conference to decide it\nis better to encourage students to take\nto the streets to support school teachers on strike than it is to provide NUS\nmembers with a plan that will ensure\nthat the organisation still exists in five\nyears time. It is one of these tragic situations where you don\u2019t know whether\nto laugh or cry.\nThe consensus amongst our NUS\ndelegation is that now is the time to\nleave this sinking ship before we have to\nwrite them another five figure cheque.\nThe money we save could be spent far\nmore effectively on what Imperial students want rather than continuing to\nfinance and lend our credibility to this\nfailing organisation. The NUS is at best\na nostalgic nod back to the worst excesses of 1970s student absurdity. Their\npriorities are so far divorced from our\nown they are almost academic so I say\nlets leave them to it.\nNUS promised us reform and value\nfor money. They have without doubt\nfailed on both accounts. Some will argue that we should stay in it to change\nit but thanks to the back issues of Felix\nI can tell you that this has been argued\nsince last time we disaffiliated in the\nlate \u201870s. They provide Imperial students with nothing we can\u2019t do our-selves. NUS has proved itself too broken to fix and the question you need\nto ask is whether it is worth gambling\n\u00a346k to attempt to change it again.\nNext week some friends and I will\nbe around campus asking you to sign\na petition to give the student body the\nchance to decide if we wish to continue remain in this well meaning yet\ndoomed organisation. If you have any\nquestions or would like to add your\nname to the petiton please email me\nyour name, course and CID number\nto stephen.brown03@imperial.ac.uk. I\nlook forward to talking to as many of\nyou as possible about this and would\nlike to hear what you would like to\nspend the money on instead.\n\u201c\nIf you would\nlike to read a\nnormal column\nthis week, then\nplease circle\nOption A\nCongratulations! You chose Option E. Welcome to the Sapphire Club\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFriday 2 May 2008 felix\nArts\nin any way.\nThere are a disproportionate number\nof Americans rattling on. The one talking about Miro is a smooth-talker\nand gets a bit philosophical at times,\nbut says nothing of substance (\u201cit\u2019s all\nlike... symbols\u201d, \u201cisn\u2019t that a trip?\u201d). I\u2019m\nmoderately amused by his ramblings\nabout his beard: \u201cyou might be able to\nhear me scratching my beard, which is\nsomething we art-lookers like to do.\nEveryone, rub your beard, or at least\nrub your chin a bit... 50% of going to\ngalleries is the looking cool\u201d. Don\u2019t get\nme started on the family of nutcases\n(The Trachtenburg Family Slideshow\nPlayers, as they call themselves) singing about the Giacometti. \u201cWe are the\nworld\u2019s first and only indie vaudeville\nconceptual slideshow family band\u201d\nmakes me want to start my own indie\nvaudeville conceptual slideshow family band (whatever the fark that is)\nto make them and their stupid guitar\nstrummings shut up about it. Additional highlights include a man who\nspends his life building piles of bananas in public places as an art form (and\nlikes to talk about it), and the sounds of\nsomebody wheeling a trolley through\nthe building.\nAt times hearing other people\u2019s\nopinions is interesting. You come to\nappreciate that for every person looking at art there is a whole new way of\ninterpreting art, and they highlight\nthings you don\u2019t see for yourself. But\nafter a whole podcast tour of people\nblathering on, you might feel the urge\nto punch somebody. I far preferred the\nstyle of the \u2018Modern Paint\u2019 tour.\nNow on to The National Gallery. The\nwebsite had filled me with optimism,\npromising that I could collect a map to\naccompany the \u2018Be Inspired\u2019 tour \u2013 the\nobvious solution to all my problems. I\nasked at the information desk and they\nknew what I was talking about but said\nsuch a map would be at the audioguide\ndesk. Despite asking at two different\naudioguide desks I was unable to find\nanybody who knew what a podcast\nwas, let alone provide me with a map\nto one. Had this mysterious podcast\nmap existed, I would be singing The\nNational Gallery\u2019s praises right now.\nFilled with despair by the thought of\nwandering around the huge galleries\naimlessly, I headed for the ArtStart\nroom, a room full of computers offering databases of the NG collections. I\ncould have had ArtStart\u2019s babies.\nThe NG \u2018Be Inspired\u2019 tour was beautifully done. A soothing female narrator\ndescribed the paintings and introduced\nvarious speakers. These speakers were\ngenerally artists themselves, but there\nwas a poet, a political cartoonist and\na cookery writer amongst others. All\nwere discussing their favourite paintings in the NG and how they had been\ninfluenced by them. But instead of just\ngushing about what the painting means\nto them personally, as in the Tate tour,\nthey also talk about the painting\u2019s history and meaning and this made for a\ngood balance. This tour was definitely\nthe best, despite the lack of a map.\nThe most amusing piece on the tour\nwas a Crivelli painting of \u2018The Conception\u2019. And when I say \u2018The Conception\u2019,\nwe\u2019re talking about God impregnating Mary. Who knew there would be\npaintings of that? And apparently the\nmethod of conception was via a beam\nof gold light penetrating her head. But\nthe podcast focuses on food. The cucumber and the apple at the front supposedly represent the purity of Christ\nand the fecundity of Mary (!). The\nbeautiful peacock with its tail swishing\ndown, I\u2019m sorry to say, was considered\nfood too. Apparently back in ye olde\ntimes you\u2019d skin the peacock, then after cooking it you\u2019d put it back in its\nfeathers and use clockwork mechanisms to make it walk up and down\nthe dinner table before you ate it. Now\nthat\u2019s entertainment.\nSomething I\u2019ll praise The National\nGallery for is putting images of the\npaintings in with the podcast down-loads. This means you know exactly\nwhat you\u2019re looking for in the museum,\nthough obviously not everybody\u2019s music player will be able to use this. Moreover, having the pictures in front of you\ncould mean you don\u2019t even have to go\nto the museum to enjoy the tour. This\nis a very cunning idea indeed.\nOverall, the podcasts themselves\nwere wonderful. The idea of audio\ntours on your iPod has the potential to\ngo far, but I\u2019d like to see more of them\nand I\u2019d like some supporting material.\nIf Tate and The National Gallery promoted these tours and offered some\nkind of handout either online or onsite,\nwith a map and information about what\nmight have been taken down, podcast\ntours could be much improved. There\nis so much potential for expansion into\ndifferent themes and different target\naudiences. My iPod and I look forward\nto hearing what London\u2019s art galleries\nhave to offer us.\n\u201cHighlights\ninclude a man\nwho builds piles\nof bananas in\npublic places as\nan art form\u201d\nSome young gents being positively fascinated by an audio tour. Fellas, why aren\u2019t you scratching your\nbeards like real arty types? We\u2019ve been informed today that 50% of going to galleries is the looking cool\nThe podcast said this is a self-portrait, and that it\u2019s vibrating. Vibrating\nchairs? There\u2019s a joke there\nThis unexceptional painting inspired a political cartoon where Tony Blair was failing to build a cabinet.\nCharles Clarke was a torn-up joker\n\n"

The paper sought\nto return Union status to the RSM,\npreviously lost in 2002, and required a\ntwo-thirds majority to succeed, however it gained only 13 votes for and 8\nagainst.\nTempers boiled-over when Council\nvoted to amend sections of the paper much to the dismay of the RSM\nproposers who felt it had changed\ntoo much thus losing its original substance and purpose. In response to\nthe amendments voted through, RSM\nPresident Danny Hill stormed out of\nthe room declaring that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t\ngive a shit now.\u201d\nAs the evening progressed, Union\nstalwart Jon Matthews (who helped\nto present the paper) came up against\ncriticism from Deputy President (Fi-nance & Services) Chris Larvin, who\nwas the most vocal opponent of the\npaper. The paper was supported by\n184 seconders, many of whom were\ncontacted via blanket email of the RSM\nmailing list. The DPFS questioned the\nmanner in which the seconders were\nobtained and also their validity. Mr\nMatthews erupted at these sugges-tions, requesting Mr Larvin to rescind\nhis comments, which he felt implied\nthat the proposers had lied to Council\nabout the way in which they collected\nthe seconders. In response, the DPFS\nasked for the original emails to be read\nout to Councillors bringing particular\nattention to lines which promised a\n\u201cwin win situation [for the RSM]\u201d and\n\u201cmore money for RSM Clubs and activities!\u201d if the recipients simply clicked\nreply and then send.\nThe discussions became more and\nmoreheated,andeventuallyCouncillor\nRosie Smithells and Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare) Kirsty Patterson became entangled in the bickering.\nFinally when the paper was rejected in\nits entirety Mr Matthews, Ms Smithells\nand Ms Patterson collectively marched\nout of the room along with a few other\nRSM supporters. Ms Smithells also\nlater resigned as a Councillor.\nThe most significant dispute during\nthe evening centred around the level of\nrepresentation the RSM would be given on various Union committees. The\nproposers wanted to bring the RSM\u2019s\nlevel of representation closer to that of\nthe existing Faculty Unions and also\nthe Campus Unions of Silwood and\nWye, by creating a position on both the\nExecutive Committee and Representation & Welfare Board (RWB). This was\nmet with opposition since the RSM\nconsists of 850 students compared to,\nsay, the Royal College of Science Union (RCSU) which has approximately\n4,500 students.\nIt was also feared that over-repre-sentation of the RSM would pave the\nway for other Clubs & Societies Committees (CSCs) such as the Athletics\nClubs Committee (ACC, which represents all of the Union\u2019s sports clubs)\nto request for a member on Exec and\nRWB since they represent a far larger\nproportion of students than the RSM.\nThe paper\u2019s proposers countered this\nby drawing on the RSM\u2019s historical significance within Imperial College Union, claiming that the collective spirit\nof RSM students distinguishes them\nfrom other students and hence their\nrepresentation and welfare needs are\ndifferent. A similar reasoning justifies\nwhy the Silwood and Wye Unions have\nmembers on committees such as Exec\nand RWB, however it was pointed out\nthat those students have vastly different needs since they live far away from\nImperial\u2019s main campus.\nA number of other points within the\npaper were discussed on the night,\nmore of which can be found by heading\nto live.cgcu.net where you\u2019ll also find a\nrecording from mid-way through the\nserious business.\nSince the theatrics of Monday night,\nsome of the paper\u2019s supporters have\nadmitted to overreacting and behaving\npoorly. However, the proposers maintain they were disrespectfully treated\non Monday night, citing particularly\nthe allegations that they were lying to\nCouncil and the accusations that the\nentire exercise was a \u201cpower grab\u201d by\nthe RSM.\nDespite all of this though, there\nhasn\u2019t been this much talk of the RSM,\nits structure and its effectiveness in a\nlong while. The proposers have stated\nthat they will follow up the paper in the\nfuture after consulting with as many of\nthe Union\u2019s committees as possible.\nMr Larvin has also reiterated that he\nwould love to see the RSM with Union\nstatus and that he looks forward to seeing an improved paper return.\nOne Councillor showing early\nsymptoms of losing the will to\nlive\nphoenix the arts magazine of imperial college\nwhat\u02bcs that thing\nin the bins\nic doesn\u02bct know\ngive it a go\nyou never know\nyou might just enjoy it\nphoenix 2008 vol 1\nout now\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12 felix Friday 2 May 2008\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 Li-Teck Lau and Kadhim Shubber\nLooking forward Tibetter times\nKadhim Shubber welcomes you back to university with a light discussion of China and its Olympic Games\nT\nhe Olympics have turned\nout to be a double-edged\nsword for the Chinese.\nRather than an opportunity to show off Chinese\neconomic progress, it has become\na gift for anti-Chinese protestors to\nvoice their anger over Tibet. Behind\nthe protests is a violent story that is\nrarely heard. Who is the Dalai Lama?\nWhat is the history? What is going on\nin Tibet? Join me on this story of controversial struggle, violent oppression\nand a bitterly contested past.\nBorn a Leader\nThe institution of the Dalai Lama has\nled the Tibetan people for centuries,\nstretching all the way back to the 14th\ncentury. Each successive Dalai Lama is\na re-incarnation of the previous and as\na lineage, the Dalai Lama is believed\nto be an embodiment of compassion.\nIn 1938, at the age of 3, Tenzin Gyatso\nwas identified as the 14th Dalai Lama\n(the 13th had died 5 years earlier). Just\ntwelve years later, he was given his full\npolitical power as leader of the Tibetan\npeople; he was only 15 years old. He is\nthe world\u2019s longest living leader, surpassing Queen Elizabeth II by 2 years,\nand is surrounded by controversy.\nFor the Tibetan people, he is the\nultimate spiritual and moral leader,\nwith no competitors. He has led them\nthrough 50 years of Chinese rule and\nthe turmoil of the Cultural Revolution to the modern day with a strict\nadherence to non-violence. Ordinary\nTibetans are mostly obedient to him\nand have for the most part followed his\ndoctrine of non-violence. However, his\ntactics and policies have come under\ncriticism from certain quarters, such\nas the Tibetan Youth Congress, who\nwant complete independence even \u201cat\nthe cost of one\u2019s life\u201d. Recent rioting in\nTibet is a striking example of the fact\nthat ordinary Tibetans do not always\nadhere to the Dalai Lama\u2019s standard of\nnon-violence.\nIn the West, he is regarded foremost\nas a pacifist icon, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his dedication to non-violence and peace.\nHe is, however, also a source of embarrassment to governments around\nthe world. The Chinese apply pressure\non national governments not to meet\nhim when he travels. He often only\nmeets low-ranking officials and in May\n2007, Belgium went so far as to ask the\nDalai Lama not to visit their country.\nIn November 2007, the Pope refused\nto meet him because he didn\u2019t want to\nupset negotiations with the Chinese\non the Church in China. On the other\nhand, if you want to pay lip service\nto criticism of Chinese human rights\nabuses, he is your man. Some Western\nleaders have made superficial snubs\nto the Chinese by meeting the Dalai\nLama and in 2007 he was awarded the\nCongressional Medal of Honour by the\nU.S., something that is sure to aid the\npeople of Tibet. In the West, the Dalai\nLama is a man who will always receive\nlip service, perhaps even funding but\nnever the kind of real support that\nwould jeopardise relations with China.\nThe Chinese establishment detests\nhim; his image and works are completely banned in Tibet. In China he is\nnot regarded as a pacifist; instead he\nis a \u2018splittist\u2019, a troublemaker seeking\nto break up China. They don\u2019t believe\nhim when he says that he isn\u2019t seeking\ncomplete independence. He is accused\nof masterminding the recent riots in\nLhasa and even organising suicide attacks against the Chinese. Phrases that\nare commonly used to describe him\ninclude, a \u201cwolf in monk\u2019s robes\u201d. He\nis seen to be a puppet for Western attempts to split and undermine China.\nThe accusation that the Dalai Lama\norganised the recent riots in Tibet is\nlikely to be false, but his dedication to\nnon-violence should not be viewed un-critically. In 1998 the New York Times\nreported that the Tibetan government-in-exile received $1.7 million a year\nin the 1960\u2019s from the CIA which was\npartly used to pay for guerrilla operations against the Chinese, an allegation\nwhich was confirmed by the Tibetan\ngovernment-in-exile. Does this mean\nthat the Dalai Lama isn\u2019t a pacifist? No,\nbut it does show that there is more to\nthe Dalai Lama than the hagiographi-cal Western view suggests.\nSimilarly, although the Dalai Lama\nrejects claims that he wants Tibetan\nindependence, this has not always been\nthe official line. It is since 1979 that the\nDalai Lama abandoned pursuing inde-pendence, in part because in 1979 Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping stated, \u201cexcept independence, all other issues can\nbe resolved through negotiations\u201d. The\nreason why he only asks for \u2018autonomy\u2019\nis because he knows that independence\nis off the cards, off the negotiating table\nand out the window. The Chinese fear\nthat if they discuss \u2018autonomy\u2019 with the\nDalai Lama, independence might be\nforced back onto the table; i.e. if they\ngive him an inch, he\u2019ll take a mile.\nPeaceful? Certainly. Complex? Of\ncourse. It wouldn\u2019t be far from the\ntruth to describe the Tenzin Gyatso as\na peaceful pragmatist.\nA Contested History\nSince 1959 this peaceful pragmatist has\nlived in Dharamsala, India, which is the\nseat of the Tibetan government-in-ex-ile and the first port of call for Tibetan\nrefugees. The events surrounding the\nLama\u2019s exile and Chinese control of\nTibet in the mid-20th century are the\nsource of fierce controversy.\nIn the first half of the 20th century,\nChina was a weakened nation. Colonialism and civil war between the\nNationalist Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist party meant that it\nwas unable to exert real influence in\nTibet. So after 1912, when the 13th\nDalai Lama declared complete independence from China, Tibet was a de\nfacto independent country although\nno Western countries recognised it as\nsuch. As the civil war came to an end in\nthe late 40\u2019s, the Chinese Communist\nParty was powerful enough to bring\nTibet under its control again. In 1949\nChinese forces entered the area of Tibet outside the current Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) and then in 1950\nentered the whole of Tibet proper. An\nagreement between the Tibetans and\nthe Chinese, called the 17-point agree-ment, was signed in 1951 and formally\nrecognised Chinese control in Tibet;\nTibetans consider this agreement to be\nforced upon them and it was later repudiated by the Tibetan government-in-exile. In 1959, after a failed uprising\nby the Tibetans, the Dalai Lama fled\nTibet fearing for his life and set up the\nTibetan government-in-exile in Dharmasala, India.\nThis much can be asserted without\ntoo much trouble, though whether\nyou see these events as an invasion or\nreunification depends largely on your\nhistorical perspective. The arguments\nabout the shared history of Tibet and\nChina lead us to ask: was Tibet part of\nChina or not?\nChinese historians consider Tibet an\nintegral part of China from the Mongol\nYuan dynasty to the modern day. Evidence of Chinese administration in Tibet is cited as proof of Chinese sover-eignty. As dynasties rose and fell, these\nhistorians maintain that Chinese sovereignty did not change and Tibet remained part of China. With the ascent\nof the Qing Dynasty in the 17th centu-ry, Chinese control of Tibet increased\nbut this is seen as the natural manifestation of Chinese sovereignty rather\nthan a development in Sino-Tibetan\nrelations. A prime piece of evidence\ncited by Chinese historians is the fact\nthat China repelled Ghurkha troops\nfrom Tibet in 1792, thus proving their\nposition as protector and sovereign of\nTibet. The decline of the Qing dynasty,\nand Tibetan independence from 1912\nhad no impact on Chinese claims to\nTibet. Therefore the events of 1950\nrepresent the reunification of China\nand Tibet. The period 1912-1950 is a\nblip in an otherwise continuous history of Sino-Tibetan relations in which\nTibet was politically, economically and\nmilitary subordinate to. and definitely\nan integral part of, China.\nTibetan historians see no such subordination in Tibet\u2019s history. The relationship between Tibet and China\nis a priest-patron relationship. This\npersonal understanding between the\nDalai Lama and the Chinese Emperors involved the patron, the Emperor,\ngiving military and political protection\nto the priest, the Dalai Lama, in return\nfor spiritual guidance and legitimacy.\nThis mutually beneficial agreement\nbetween independent states is a stark\nalternative to the Chinese viewpoint.\nHowever, unlike the Chinese narrative,\nTibetan historians place a distinct emphasis on 20th century events. The inability of the Qing dynasty to intervene\neffectively in Tibet is shown clearly by\nthe British march on Lhasa in 1903.\nPro-Chinese and pro-Tibetan protestors mingle outside Downing Street during the London leg of he Olympic torch relay\nCARLOS\nJOAQUIN\nKARINGAL\n\n"

We arrived at the\nClub at Sheffield at 10 am and had 30\nminutes to warm up and get ready for\nthe important matches.\nFirst on court was our number 5\nstring Mike Gamblin who was replacing our team captain Mitchell Hensman; who unfortunately had an important commitment and couldn\u2019t join us\nfor the finals.\nMike had a good start on the match\nand maintained an early advantage in\nthe first two games to win 9/4, 9/2. In\nthe third his rival started to play better\nsquash and took the advantage 7-4, but\nMike recuperated and won the game\n9-7 to give us the first valuable point.\nIn the other court, Harry Beeston\nhad already started his match and even\nthough they had some long rallies, the\nImperial student was always in control\nof the T and won the first two games\n9-3, 9-2. The third game was a little different and the student from the\nUniversity of Birmingham had an early\nlead, though Harry took the final game\n9-7.\nThen Ross and I (Federico Torres)\nwent to the courts, I had a slow start as\nusual in each game, but after the first 2\npoints I dominated the match and was\nable to put a good performance to win\n3-0; 9-3, 9-2, 9-7.\nMeanwhile, Ross Lillis at Number 4\nwas having a difficult time. He won the\nfirst game 9-6 but lost the second 9-4,\nthough he had a comfortable win in the\nthird 9-1. Nevertheless, after that the\nBirmingham student pulled off an impressive performance to win the fourth\ngame 9-0.\nThe fifth was a very long game and\nboth players were tired, yet the Imperial student had more energy left in the\ntank and was able to finish the game\n9-5 to win the match.\nLast on court was our number 2 player James Simpson; he played quite well\nand the Birmingham team didn\u2019t have\ntoo much left after four losses. After\nsome good long rallies James won the\nmatch 9-4, 9-2, 9-7.\nWith this win we are one match away\nfrom finishing a perfect season, as we\nare unbeaten in all our BUSA and ULU\nmatches, we won the BUSA Shield\nchampionship, the BUSA league, the\nULU league and next term we will play\nthe final of the ULU Cup knockout\nagainst Kings College.\nWe as a team will like to thank our\ncaptain, Mitch Hensman, for all his efforts in organising our training, matches and competitions and we would also\nlike to thank all the people from Sports\nImperial for their support.\nFederico Torres\nIC Squash Club win BUSA Shield\nImperial men\u2019s squash team with the BUSA shield\nE\nxam time is upon us and I\nwish you all the best of luck\nin your forthcoming exams.\nSince it is also the summer\nperiod, the sports pages are\ngoing to be a bit bare this term, so don\u2019t\nbe expecting too many pages from me.\nHopefully the summer sports clubs,\nwill provide us with enough to actually\nhave a sports page, so look forward to\nhearing from the cricket club, athletics\nand maybe even croquet!!!\nOne of these weeks, once it seems\nlike everyone has finished their season,\nI\u2019ll do a round up of all the clubs and\npick out some awards such as Men\u2019s\nTeam of the Year, Women\u2019s Team of\nthe Year, Team of the Year, Club of the\nYear, Individual of the Year and any\nothers I can think of!\nFinally, since I\u2019ll be the editor next\nyear, a new Sports Editor will be re-quired.

This is more\nthan a case of differing angles; rather\nthe drastic difference of reporting represents the fact that the Tibetan issue\nis judged on completely different terms\nin China than it is in the UK.\nThe treatment received by the Tibetan people, while deplorable, is not\nhugely different from that received\nby most people living in the Chinese\nstate. Land seizures, surveillance and\nlengthy imprisonment for dissenters\nis not unique to the Tibetan people.\nOne might expect this fact to generate\nsympathy amongst ordinary Chinese\npeople; however, the sensitivity of the\nissue of Tibetan independence means\nthat this is not the case. The threat of\nimprisonment is often dealt with as\na common sense issue for many Chinese citizens: \u2018if you don\u2019t protest, you\nwon\u2019t get into trouble\u2019. Furthermore, in\nChina, the Tibetan conflict is framed\nin terms of national unity vs. foreign\ninterference rather than human rights\nvs. oppression. The Tibetan rioters\nare commonly referred to as part of\nthe \u2018Dalai Lama clique\u2019; the violence\nbeing engineered and orchestrated by\nthe Dalai Lama. The clique also refers\nto the plethora of pro-Tibetan groups\noutside China as well as the celebrity\nbackers of the Tibetan movement. As\na result, the motives of the rioters are\nnot connected to the general plight\nof the Tibetan people (or the general\nlack of civil freedoms in China) but\ninstead they are connected to foreign\ninterference and meddling. The very\nreal abuses perpetrated by the Chinese\ngovernment are swept under nationalistic pride. It is not a matter of whether\nthe Chinese respect Tibetan autonomy,\nbut rather whether pro-Tibetan groups\nin the West and the Tibetan govern-ment-in-exile respect Chinese unity\nand sovereignty in Tibet.\nAlthough the Chinese fear of Tibetan\nindependence is not a phobia, there is a\nfailure to address the root cause of the\nrecent protests and riots. They do not\nmerely stem from the larger historical\ndispute but directly from the gross disregard for Tibetan self-determination.\nThe protests in London and Paris,\nwhich coincided with the arrival of the\nOlympic torch, were not spurred on\nby the principle of Tibetan independ-ence. Although the protests called for\n\u2018a Free Tibet\u2019 they were motivated by\nthe treatment of Tibetans at Chinese\nhands. By framing the dispute in terms\nof splittism and national unity, the Chinese ignore the fact that it is not simply\nthe 1950 invasion that burns in Tibetan\nhearts but 5 decades of oppressive rule.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that the Chinese\nperspective is delusional; it might be\nasked how many pro-Tibetan groups\nwould disband if China ceased human\nrights violations in Tibet. I should imagine very few. Similarly, the perception of this conflict as a human rights\nissue isn\u2019t groundless; it is the existence\nof human rights violations that gives\nweight to this perspective and only\nwhen the rights of the Tibetan people\nare respected will moral human beings\nempathise with the threat to the unity\nof China.\nThe future\nUnfortunately there is little hope that\nthe Chinese government will seek reconciliation with the Tibetan people or\nthe Dalai Lama; what are the reasons\nfor this?\nThe Beijing Olympics are on the\nhorizon and any shift in policy will\ninevitably lead to a huge amount of\ndomestic and international attention\non Tibet. Also, there is no certainty\nabout what might happen if control\nwas relaxed; would the situation spiral\nout of Chinese hands? Regardless, for\nthe Chinese government it is a much\nsafer bet to continue with their current\npolicy in order to prevent disturbances\nin Tibet, minimise negative publicity\nand appear strong for the Olympics.\nThere will still be negative publicity\nsurrounding the Chinese Olympicspro-Tibetan groups will try their best\nto ensure this - but for the Chinese\ngovernment, now is not the time to\nembark on an uncertain shift in policy\nregarding Tibet.\nMore generally, there are powerful\nreasons why a change in course is un-likely. In the last 50 years, the Chinese\ngovernment has invested a lot of time\nand money establishing China\u2019s claim\nto sovereignty in Tibet. This includes\nmassive economic investment, ensuring China\u2019s historical narrative justifies Chinese control, continuously\ndenouncing the Dalai Lama and persuading the Chinese people that Tibet\nis an integral part of China. The word\nU-turn is grossly inadequate to describe the magnitude of a shift in policy\nregarding Tibet. Importantly, a change\nwouldn\u2019t be perceived as benevolence,\nbut at home and abroad it would be\na sign of weakness. By responding to\ninternational pressure on a domestic\nissue, the Chinese government would\nsignal a willingness to be swayed on\nits domestic affairs by foreign governments and NGO\u2019s. At home, fears of\nforeign interference, that the Chinese\ngovernment has succumbed to external pressure, would be vindicated\nand the Communist Party\u2019s authority\nwould be undermined by a perceived\nsubservience to the \u2018West\u2019. For the\nChinese Communist Party, appearing\nstrong and in control of China\u2019s affairs is much more important than appearing to be concerned about human\nrights. This is not the same as saying\nthat change is impossible. International pressure can work; but the type of\npressure has to be tactful. High-profile\nprotests and shrill denouncements by\nforeign leaders will likely bolster hardliners within the Chinese government.\nA boycott of the Olympics is exactly\nthe kind of action that is unlikely to see\nresults, though I concede that there are\nworthy arguments for a boycott. Unfortunately, the lengthy and difficult\nlow-profile work required in order to\nbegin to see progress on the Tibet issue will not reap instant rewards for\nWestern leaders. Without the publicity and PR potential of \u2018standing up to\nChina\u2019, Western governments are unlikely to risk straining their relations\nwith China.\nPessimism seems to be the order of\nthe day for Tibet. The Chinese government are more likely to wait for the\nDalai Lama to die, rather than begin\nthe politically risky process of opening\nrelations with him; a policy similar to\nthe U.S.\u2019s when dealing with Fidel Castro. They will continue to strengthen\nTibet\u2019s economic ties with the rest of\nChina with continuing investment, the\nnewly built railway signals this inten-tion, as well allowing greater immigration in order to blur the distinction\nbetween Tibet and China. The end\nresult is the slow choking of the concept of Tibetan independence as new\ngenerations of Tibetans grow up in\nsecular prosperity with an increasingly\nChinese culture. Chinese is already\nthe language used in Tibetan schools,\nuniversities and local government. As\nwith the rest of its citizens, the Chinese\ngovernment hope that the stick of op-pression, in conjunction with the carrot of high living standards, will teach\nthe Tibetans to accept Chinese rule\nonce and for all. In the long-term, this\nmay well be the result; the near future,\nhowever, does not seem to reveal such\na peaceful path. Although the Dalai\nLama has led the Tibetan people along\na path of non-violence, signs suggest\nthat they may not continue on his path\nafter his death. The recent riots suggest\ndissatisfaction with the lack of results\nnon-violence has achieved and also a\nsimmering anger and resentment towards the Chinese. When the Dalai\nLama dies, it is likely that his devotion\nto non-violence will die also. The next\nDalai Lama is unlikely to have similar\ninfluence amongst young Tibetans living under Chinese rule. The Chinese\nbacked Dalai Lama won\u2019t be accepted\nby the Tibetan people, while a \u2018true\u2019\nDalai Lama will probably be born in\nexile; by definition disconnected from\nhis people. Leaderless, and no longer\ntied to non-violence; the repressive\ntactics of the Chinese government are\nlikely to provoke violent reactions in\nTibet. Both the Chinese governments\nwish for a subdued minority and the\nDalai Lama\u2019s effort for a peaceful future are unlikely to be fulfilled. It is for\nthis reason that the Chinese government must seek a solution with Tenzin\nGyatso; rather than China\u2019s archenemy\nhe is their most valuable ally. By refusing to budge on the Tibet issue, they\ndiscredit the Dalai Lama\u2019s peaceful approach and force the Tibetan people\nto push the other button. In order to\nevade bloodshed, a solution must be\nsought now; pro-Tibetan\u2019s may argue\nthat China doesn\u2019t care about bloodshed while China\u2019s supporters will\nblame the Tibetans for the violence but\nit is obvious to all that China\u2019s policies\nin Tibet are unsustainable, offensive to\nthe Tibetan people and lead inevitably\nto the Chinese equivalent of the chickens coming home to roost.\nDry Wit & Tonic\nThe calm after the storm\nCARLOS JOAQUIN KARINGAL\n\n"

City\n& Guilds College Union President\n(CGCU), Tristan Sherliker resigned on\nMonday citing that a combination of\npersonal reasons and the level of work\nrequired of a final year student have left\nhim unable to carry on satisfactorily.\nIn the final issue of last term, Felix\nreported on the No-confidence motion\nproposed by CGCU members against\nMr Sherliker. They believed he had not\nlived up to his responsibilities as President, specifically that his attendance at\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nmeetings was poor and that he failed\nto communicate with his colleagues\nwhen they needed him.\nDuring the Easter break the CGCU\nheld an emergency meeting to decide\non the No-confidence motion. The\npaper was rejected and Mr Sherliker\nremained in the role until earlier this\nweek when he announced his resigna-tion. He has since said he would have\nhappily continued as President despite\nthe No-confidence, but personal issues\nhad lessened the amount of time he\nhad to spend in his position.\nThe Guilds will have to remain without a leader for the rest of the term\nsince Monday night\u2019s Council decided\nto suspend the Presidential elections\nuntil next academic year.\nNaboo coup: Mighty Boosh\nstar coming to Summer Ball\nKadhim Shubber\nUnion launches new evening\ncatering menu in daVinci\u2019s\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor-in-Prowling\nThe Union has unveiled its new\nevening menu this week, in an attempt\nto improve the quality of food provid-ed.

New additions made include a\n6oz Aberdeen Angus burger and scampi and chips. The Felix team went to\nsample this new menu, with the food\ngetting some mixed reviews. Ordering\nthe food is simple enough, you just go\nto the bar and order, then take a seat\nand wait for it to be delivered.

The dispute arose because\nMr Yong refused to pay Council Tax to\nCamden Council during the writing-up phase of his PhD. Most PhD students enter this phase after they have\ncompleted three years of their doctorate and only their thesis remains to be\nwritten. Students granted with writ-ing-up status are not required to pay\ntuition fees, however restrictions are\nplaced upon the amount of facilities\naround College they can access.\nMore importantly, Imperial College fails to recognise writing-up students as full-time students which was\nthe cause of the dispute last term. Mr\nYong claimed that he met \u201call criteria\nfor being a full-time student\u201d as defined by Council Tax guidelines,\nbut Camden Council refused to\nacknowledge this since College\nwouldn\u2019t provide a statement\nthat \u201cconfirmed the writing up\nof his PhD constitutes continuation of his full time course.\u201d\nMr Yong was left to defend\nhimself in court but in the end\nthe judge ruled that he was \u201cobviously\u201d a full-time student.\nThe result is somewhat of a\nlandmark case since many universities across the UK operate\nwith a similar attitude to their\nwriting-up students as Imperial does.\nThe result will also lend\nweight to the Union which\nwill be encouraging College to\nrevise its stance on writing-up students when it makes\na presentation to Imperial\u2018s\nStrategic Education Committee in May.\nMr Yong will be giving\nan account of his\nexperiences in a coming issue of\nFelix.

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 2 May 2008 felix\nPolitics\nAs further proof of Tibetan independ-ence, the period 1912 \u2013 1950 is cited as\na modern-day example of a sovereign\nTibetan state.\nBoth the Tibetan and Chinese arguments are ultimately modern con-structs, which fall down when the true\ncomplexity of Sino-Tibetan relations is\nexamined. Tibet was neither an integral\npart of China, nor was it completely in-dependent. In the Yuan and Ming dy-nasties, Chinese \u2018sovereignty\u2019 in Tibet\nwas nominal at best; the existence of\nadministrative offices does not equate\nto political power or sovereignty. No\nChinese taxes or laws were implemented in Tibet during the Yuan and Ming\ndynasties. A look at the geographical\nrecords from these times distinguishes\nbetween China and Tibet as two separate entities. Although Tibet was under\nYuan control (through the Mongol in-vasion) the reality strongly contradicts\nthe phrase \u2018an integral part of China\u2019.\nAs we move into the Qing dynasty,\nthe Tibetan argument is weakened as\nChinese control increased and direct\nrule even existed at times. The Tibetan\nproposition that Tibet was completely\nindependent simply does not carry any\nweight when looking at this period.\nThe priest-patron relationship, with no\nsubordination, becomes impossible to\napply to Qing dynasty relations. However, again this does not mean that the\ndistinction between Tibet and China\ndisappeared.\nThe closest Western definition to\nsuch a complex relationship is one of\nvassalage. As Chinese power waxed\nand waned, so too did the level of influence it exerted in Tibet. However,\na sense of Tibetan nationhood has existed throughout its long history with\nChina. Tibetan rule in Tibet was a\nreality for many centuries, along with\na native Tibetan bureaucracy, which\nconducted its business in the Tibetan\nlanguage. Although Tibet has been\nsubject to varying degrees of control\nfrom its powerful neighbour, the description \u2018an integral part of China\u2019\ndoes not stand up to critical judgement\nand ignores the obvious historical distinctions that separate Tibet and China. Unfortunately, the complex history\nof Sino-Tibetan relations has largely\nbeen painted over to construct political arguments for the modern day con-flict. Regardless of historical evidence,\nthe Communist Party in China has\nsuccessfully inculcated in the minds of\nthe Chinese people that Tibet is and always has been part of China.\nHow can this historical analysis help\nus with the modern day conflict? I concede that the historical argument is a\ngreater tool for Tibetan nationalists\nthan it is for the Chinese government\nbut it does show us that a rejection of\nChinese influence is not justified his-torically. The argument that Tibet has\nbeen \u2018an integral part of China\u2019 is perhaps inadequate rather than errone-ous. During the Yuan, Ming and Qing\ndynasties, Tibet was part of a larger\nChinese Empire. The fact that Tibetans\nhave a distinct political and cultural\nhistory does not immediately suggest\nthat Tibet should be independent; such\na suggestion implies that by principle\nmulti-national states shouldn\u2019t exist.\nIn many ways, the historical narrative does not and should not carry too\nmuch weight in the question of modern day Tibetan independence. There\nare a multitude of national groups that\ndo not have their own country; the Assyrians, for example, but that there are\nalso national groups that have 2 coun-tries, the Koreans for example. The\ncrux of the Tibetan issue lies not with\nits contested history and the lottery-like manner with which states gained\nor lost independence in the 20th cen-tury, but with the modern day issues\nand challenges that face Tibetans and\nChinese today.\nChina\u2019s record in Tibet over the last\n50 years is the most important issue in\nthis debate and is equally if not more\ncontroversial than the history of SinoTibetan relations. The Chinese government points to the economic progress\nTibethasseenwhilesteadfastlydenying\norignoringaccusationsofhumanrights\nabuses. Pro-Tibetan groups accuse the\nChinese of economic discrimination\nagainst Tibetans and a wide range of\nhuman rights abuses from torture to\nforced sterilisation. Furthermore, pro-Chinese groups accuse the \u2018West\u2019 of\npurposefully destabilising China by exaggerating or falsifying human rights\nabuses. In such a controversial arena,\ntwo facts should be noted; China has\ngone to great lengths to transform Tibet\u2019s economy and also that the People\u2019s Republic of China is bound by its\nown laws to respect the autonomy of\nthe people and culture of Tibet, within the Tibetan Autonomous Region\n(TAR). The controversy surrounds two\nquestions: who has benefited from Tibet\u2019s economic development and has\nthe Chinese government respected the\nautonomy of the Tibetan people? The\ndifficulty in answering these questions\naccurately is that information on the\nsituation in Tibet is severely restricted.\nAll of the information coming out of\nTibet either comes from the Chinese\ngovernment or pro-Tibetan groups.\nHowever this does not mean that it is\nimpossible to understand the nature or\nthe \u2018truth\u2019 of this conflict, it means that\nan understanding of the source of the\ninformation is almost as important as\nthe information itself.\nEconomic growth, but for whom?\nA white paper released by the Chinese government in 2003 highlights\nthe benefits that Tibetan people have\nseen due to Chinese rule. It emphasises the modernization of Tibet, from\na rural, backwards society \u2013 described\nas \u2018feudal\u2019 \u2013 to the modern and vibrant\nplace it is in the 21st century. The paper\npoints to successes such as increased\ntourism (with 600,000 tourists in 2000)\nand the fact that Tibet now has 25 scientific research centres. The project\nthat best symbolises the development\nof Tibet is the railway from Xining all\nthe way to Lhasa. By anchoring Tibet to China with a railway line,\nit physically demonstrates\nChina\u2019s policy of winning\nTibet over economically.\nPro-Tibetan groups\nargue that the Tibetans\nhave been swamped\nby Chinese immigration and excluded from\nthe economic benefits\nof development through\ndiscrimination. Chinese census figures often omit military\npersonnel and unofficial residents such as migrants,\nand so the true\nmagnitude of\nChinese migration is swept\nunder the\ncarpet. The\nFree Tibet\norganisation\nclaims that\nthe actual\npopulation\nof Chinese\npeople living\nin Tibet is up\nto 5.5 mil-lion, a million\nmore than official figures\nand larger than\nthe number of\nTibetans in Tibet;\n4.59 million (ac-cording to the 1990\nChinese census). As a\nresult, it is argued, ethnic Chinese immigrants\nboth in the cities and\nin the countryside now\ndominate economic activity in Tibet. To compound this situation,\nofficial business must be\ncarried out in Mandarin,\nthereby discriminating\nagainst Tibetans and giving Chinese immigrants\nan instant advantage in\nthe job market.\nWho are we to believe? Apart from\nour own pre-conceptions, there is little that makes one argument much\nmore credible than the other. The\ntruth, however, can still be sought out.\nWhile Chinese census figures indicate\nthat 90% of the population of Tibet is\nTibetan, this ignores the important\nfact most Tibetans (87.2%) live in rural\nareas. The Chinese have aggressively\ninvested large amounts of money in\nTibet and the economic development\nhas been focused in urban areas. The\nsuccesses that the Chinese point to\nare urban successes and this immediately gives us an answer as to who has\nbenefited most from Tibet\u2019s economic\ndevelopment. Lhasa, Tibet\u2019s capital, is\nnow at least 40% Chinese and it is this\nhigh-profile immigration to Tibet\u2019s urban and economic centres that motivates pro-Tibetan arguments. Tibetans\nhave benefited from Tibet\u2019s economic\ndevelopment, though the concentration of Chinese immigrants in urban\nareas means that Chinese immigrants\nare the ones benefiting most. The large\nmajority of Tibetans have not benefited from Tibet\u2019s economic progress primarily because they mainly live in the\ncountryside.\nA shameful record\nBut what of the Tibetan people\u2019s legal\nright to political and cultural auton-omy? It can be asserted, with confi-dence, that many of the human rights\nabuses claimed to occur in Tibet, are\ncommonplace and are not falsifica-tions. This is not to say that the reporting of human rights abuses in Tibet\nhas been perfect. The Chinese government has accused Western media\nPro-Tibet protestors outside Downing Street\ngroups and pro-Tibetan groups of exaggerating abuses and the attack is not\nwithout substance; the most famous\nexample perhaps was when Germany\u2019s\nRTL television used a photo of Nepalese security forces confronting protestors as an example of the recent riots\nand protests in Tibet. However, despite\nthe shortcomings of Western media\ngroups, these should not be exagger-ated; there is evidence from the U.N.,\nindependent human rights groups and\nthe media that vindicates accusations\nof human rights abuses. This is not an\nattempt to demonise China, but a realistic assessment of the situation.\nRegardless, the interesting debate is\nnot on the existence of human rights\nabuses but rather on the difference in\nreactions to news of these abuses. The\nvisit of Dr. Manfred Nowak, U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, to China\nin November 2005 is a perfect example\nof the vast gap between the perception\nof events in China and the rest of the\nworld. He reported forced personality\naltering, beatings, submersion in sew-age, denial of medical treatment and\nelectrocution by electric shock batons.\nHe also stated that ethnic minorities\nlike the Tibetans were persecuted as\na result of having \u201cexercised their human rights to freedom of speech, as-sembly, association or religion\u201d. In the\nUK, this is a further re-enforcement\nof the view that China as an oppressive state. However the Chinese state\nmedia Xinhua reported the same event\nmuch differently. It ignored the critical\naspects of his report, instead emphasising the progress that the visit repre-sented. It turned the story into a slight\nagainst the U.S. by reporting that the\nSpecial Rapporteur received greater\nTibet\u2019s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama\nCARLOS JOAQUIN KARINGAL\n\n"

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nW\nelcome back to another term of Felix\u2019s fabulous Arts\npages! I hope you\nall had a relaxing\nEaster holiday. I made the most of my\nEaster break by mostly sleeping, sitting in pubs, watching back to back\nepisodes of The West Wing and playing Guitar Hero for hours (I\u2019m getting\nquite good at it, you know \u2013 though I\ndid spend several weeks with \u2018Hit Me\nWith Your Best Shot\u2019 and \u2018Talk Dirty to\nMe\u2019 stuck in my head).\nBut, good little arts editor that I am,\nI also managed to cram a fair bit of art\ninto my Easter. For a start I spent a\nday frolicking through London armed\nwith my iPod, trying out some podcast\ntours (find out more by reading the\narticle!). While I was in Tate Modern I\nwas heartily disappointed to find they\u2019d\nfilled in \u2018Shibboleth\u2019. I think it\u2019s been\nmy favourite turbine hall installation.\nIt\u2019s quite amusing how you can still see\nwhere it was in the floor, and the tourists still walk along it anyway, scuffling\ntheir shoes on the uneven surface.\nI spent a week in Madrid, one of Europe\u2019s greatest capitals for art. Have\nyou been? Why not? Now\u2019s a ideal time\nto go because your Imperial swipe-card will get you heavily discounted\nor even free entry to the best galleries\nand museums there. And everybody\nneeds to see Guernica at some point in\ntheir life. Plus you\u2019ll be in Spain! Sun!\nTapas! Paella! Drinking beer at ten in\nthe morning! I had a fine time. Highlights included drinking San Miguel in\na butcher\u2019s shop, being whistled at by\ncreepy Spaniards and ingesting what I\nhave since found out to probably have\nbeen eels.\nAside from the eels, I go to the major\nLondon art galleries so often and get to\nknow them so well that it\u2019s refreshing\nto see something new and different.\nMadrid has many works of Picasso,\nGoya and Velazquez, and more old\nmasters than you can shake a stick at,\nplus countless other delights. But at\nthe same time I couldn\u2019t help thinking\nthat it would never beat London. We\nfail to appreciate how vast Britain\u2019s art\ncollections are, and how many influential and valuable pieces are in our\npossession.\nYou\u2019ll read in one of our articles this\nweek that the Queen owns 600 Leonardo da Vinci sketches. How many other countries can come anywhere near\nthat figure? It probably isn\u2019t fair that\nour tiny island nation gets to dominate\nthe world\u2019s cultural scene, but I\u2019m not\nexactly complaining. As a student in\nLondon you have such privileged access to so much culture. Get out and\nsee it, reader!\nIn addition to my little podcast jaunt,\nthe fabulous Ms Rosie Grayburn herself has been to see some very amazing\nand rare things courtesy of Her Majesty, and her article is bound to delight\nyou with its tales of David Attenborough and civet anal glands. Mmm\u2026\ncivet anal glands.\nSome amazing, rare things\ncourtesy of Her Majesty\nT\nhinking about it, I suppose\nwe all expect some amaz-ing, rare things whenever\nwe visit an exhibition or\nan art gallery. Consequently the title of the newly opened\nexhibition at Buckingham Palace kills\ntwo birds with one [non-fatal, in fact,\nquite harmless] stone. Not only are\nthere some amazing, rare sketches by\nLeonardo da Vinci himself, but all the\nworks of art are a kind of catalogue for\nthe new, amazing species that were being discovered during the period the\npieces were created in. Expect lemons\nwith fingers, dissected porcupines and\nthe anal glands of an African civet.\nThis exhibition is really quite special,\nand has been selected from the Royal\nLibrary with the help of Sir David\n\u2018God of the Animals\u2019 Attenborough. It\nbrings together the work of four artists\nand one collector who all shared a passion for nature, no matter how bizarre.\nNo, not Prince Charles\u2019 ears. Rosie Grayburn explores Queen\u2019s Gallery exhibition\nThey are seeing these new and exciting\nspecies of plant and animal with innocent eyes. For the first time, art and science came together in the mainstream,\nleaving religion out.\nThe Queen\u2019s Gallery is situated on\nBuckingham Palace Road, just a stone\u2019s\nthrow from Victoria. The gallery is\nplush. There is gold everywhere! I\nlove it. And it is just what one would\nexpect from one\u2019s monarch. You rise\nup the lavish main staircase to the gallery and pick up an audio guide from\na lovely, polite lady. The Queen obviously knows how to do customer serv-ice. Every member of staff is practically perfect in every way, and are all\ntoo happy to show you the way to the\nloo or hang the audio guide about your\nneck like you are receiving an Olympic\ngold medal.\nThe audio guide is free, so you may\nas well pick it up anyway. There is not\nan audio blurb for each piece, unfortu-nately, but when there is one, it is not\ntoo long to bore and not too short for\nme to complain about. Rosie is happy.\nThe dulcet tones of David Attenborough accompany most of the blurbs\nas well as soothing piano music. The\nwhole experience is rather mesmeris-ing! Once you are plugged in, you enter\nthe first room of the exhibition: The\n\u2018Leonardos\u2019. Don\u2019t tell them I told you,\nbut the Queen owns 600 Leonardo\nsketches!? OMG. These 18 exhibited\nhere are just a snippet! Apparently,\nCharles II went a bit mad one day and\ndecided to collect them.\nHaving never seen \u2018a Leonardo\u2019 be-fore, I didn\u2019t know quite what to expect but I was absolutely blown away\nby Leonardo da Vinci. His sketches are\nawesome. So much so I actually raised\nmy eyebrows in amazement and in my\nhead I was saying \u201cOooooh\u201d as one\ndoes when one is very impressed. It\nis even more fantastic when you happen to glance at the date of the work.\nThe first piece, \u2018The Star of Bethlehem\u2019,\nwas done in 1505! I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nThis was a time when the art world was\nsaturated with very primal depictions\nof brightly coloured saints and martyrs\nand it is highly unexpected to see such\ntalent and detail.\n\u2018The Star of Bethlehem\u2019 sets a very\nhigh standard. It is a type of flowering plant and is done in red chalk, like\nmost of these sketches. Da Vinci seems\nto have captured the flower as though\nit were swaying underwater. Next up,\nLeonardo sketches some blackberries\nand shows off his technical talent as\nevery single leaf is studied exactly.\nSoon enough, we find out that all\nthese sketches were part of Leonardo\u2019s\nscientific observations of nature, like a\nRenaissance lab book! You become acquainted with his famous mirror writings on various sketches, in which he\nmakes various notes about the subject\nAww... poor dead birdie! The Queen can keep this one - I don\u2019t want any slaughtered animals up on my walls, ta. Pretty flowers though\nEmily Wilson\nArts Editor\n\n"

    "content": "music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nFriday 2 May 2008 felix\nMusic\nMystery Jets achieved success after their discovery by DJ/producer\nErol Alkan. They were originally\ncalled \u2018Misery Jets\u2019 after Heathrow-bound aeroplanes which\nregularly flew over their home of\nEel Island, but changed their name\nafter a spelling mistake. Fact. Roman Hochuli sat down with Mystery Jets\u2019 lead vocalist and keyboard player Blaine Harrison.\nHow did you first get in contact\nwith Erol?\nWe used to all go down to Trash quite a\nlot when it was going, which was a club\nErol ran for 10 years. It was really influential on a lot of people making music\nin London at that time. At the start, we\nall used to go down there just to see the\nbands and see Erol DJ.\nWe\u2019d done a recording session then\none day I plucked up the courage\nto bring him the demo. Turned out\nhe was a fan and already knew \u2018Zoo\nTime\u2019, which was our first single. Then\nhe started playing all our songs right\nwhen they\u2019d come out - as soon as we\nrecorded something he\u2019d be the first to\nplay it!\nSo you hadn\u2019t released very much\nand Erol was already spinning\nyour records?\nErol was one of the first people we met\nin the club circuit. He was the first person to ever play our music in a club. At\nthe time, I wasn\u2019t really aware of the\nworld of dance music, but as we dived\ninto the second album, I think we became a lot more aware of remixes and\nproducers. From that point on, I think\nwe had more of an opinion of who we\nwanted to remix our stuff as well.\nDid Erol influence your music at\nall?\nYeah, definitely. I mean the first thing\nwe did with him were some B-sides for\n\u2018Diamonds in the Dark\u2019, which was the\nlast single off our first album. It just\nwent really, really well. I remember\nwe\u2019d all been on tour for about a year\nand we were all arguing and screaming\nat each other and Erol seemed to be the\nonly person who could get us to all sit\nin the same room together and be nice\nto each other. I think that, in a way, is\none of the strongest ways in which he\ninfluenced the second album.\nMusic Felix chats with Mystery Jets Does It\nOffend You,\nYeah? live\nA\nn Andy Peters haircut\nfrom circa 1990, flying\nglowsticks, girls in the\naudience who could be\nbest described as \u2018a mess\nof neon and basically wearing seven\noutfits in one\u2019: you\u2019d think you were\nstuck in some bad lycra-sponsored rave\nscene nightmare. No, it\u2019s just the frontman of Does It Offend You, Yeah?\u2019s bad\nhair, and the shed load of MySpacers\nthey\u2019ve bought with them.\nNu-rave image aside, the band crack\ninto the stomping intro of \u2018Weird Science\u2019. It\u2019s got the fat bass of Daft Punk\u2019s\nRobot Rock and a token Tupac inspired\nvocoder entry. It\u2019s got drums and guitars that throb harder than your worst\npost-exam hangover.\nDIOYY are lyrically tasteless, as the\nname of the next track, \u2018Battle Royale\u2019,\nwill suggest. Evidently though, tasteless is sometimes a good thing, with\nthe band managing to get the crowd\nworked up and jumping as fast as they\ncan manage. The vocalist, Morgan\nQuaintance, jumps onto the stack of\namps on stage with his colourful getup which resembles neon-painted pyjamas and strikes an African clanger.\nHe shouts \u201cF*** y\u2019all, I\u2019m from Texas\u201d\n- the slogan also printed on his shirt.\nThey bang into \u2018Let\u2019s make out\u2019, a\ntrack that couldn\u2019t fail to get the most\nmiserable person dancing and feeling\nthe summer festival vibe.\nIt\u2019s rough. It\u2019s raw. It\u2019s rock clashed\nwith electro with references to punk.\nInfluences from the Prodigy, early\nBeastie Boys, and Devo are all ap-parent. DIOYY are a far cry from the\nlate 1990\u2019s scene of shoe-gazing rock.\nThey play, shout and dance in full vivid\ncolour. They\u2019re really a vehicle which\nscreams at a youthful market and gets\nthem excited. There\u2019s sound bites that\nresemble \u2018Take on Me\u2019 by A-Ha but\nwith Kurt Cobain-esque vocals and\nsynth leitmotifs, similar to Late of the\nPier or the now defunct Test Icicles.\nDIOYY announced their chart midweek result is at No. 17. It seems Virgin\nweren\u2019t wrong signing these Readingbased maniacs. They chuck in a live debut of \u2018Dawn of the Dead\u2019 and finish off\nthe set with \u2018We are Rockstars\u2019, a track\nthat embodies the band\u2019s message in a\nnutshell. Your attention is grabbed, it\u2019s\nfull of energy and it\u2019s a lot of fun.\nAvalon de Paravicini\nHe used to also give us some records\nto listen to. He\u2019d say \u201cYou might not\nlike this but I think you can learn something from it.\u201d and it really worked. We\nstarted thinking so much more outside\nthe bubble in terms of production.\nYou guys also DJ, which of you do\nthat?\nWe all DJ, but it\u2019s pretty much me, William and Kai. We usually branch off\ninto pairs.\nWe started DJing during the recording of our second album because we\nweren\u2019t playing any gigs, since we were\nstill recording or writing new material,\nand we wanted to keep going out and\nkeep contact with our fans. Spinning\nrecords in clubs just seemed the most\nobvious way of doing that.\nI keep hearing bands bring up minimal techno and I think I remember hearing you guys mention it in\nan interview. Are you guys techno\nfans?\nI think I know which one you\u2019re talking about, but we said it as a joke. I\nmean I do like dance music but I\u2019m not\ninto anyone specific and then there\u2019s a\nlot of dance music I hate. I really hate\ndrum\u2019n\u2019bass! Not because it\u2019s unfashionable or anything like that. It\u2019s just\nthat all dance music for me when I was\ngrowing up was DnB, and the people\nI hated at school used to listen to it.\nThat just kept me away from it.\nIn terms of producers, Switch is probably my favourite. He\u2019s got talks about\nthis style of producing - but basically\njust fucking with all different styles. So\nlike, throwing in a bar of dubstep and\nthen taking it back out and not subscribing to any type of music. What he\ndoes is completely his own thing.\nDid you choose people Switch\nand Riton yourselves to do your\nremixes?\nYeah, we chose to Switch do the remix\nof \u2018Hideaway\u2019, which is amazing. We\nalso have a Justice remix of \u2018You Can\u2019t\nFool me Dennis\u2019 which our label set up\nbefore anyone had even heard of Justice. Our label is really into that scene\nso they manage to get producers like\nShoes, Riton and Zongamin to do our\nremixes.\nHow did you create the effect of\nyou guys sliding up and down the\nwalls in the video for it \u2018Young\nLove\u2019?\nWell, we were on the floor on skateboards getting pushed by these guys\nin white boiler suits, who I think were\nthe real stars in the video! It was a lot\nof fun making that video but the new\none, \u2018Two Doors Down\u2019, was even more\nof a laugh: it\u2019s a pastiche of an 80s rock\nvideo.\nAbout your new album, you described it as being more \u2018radiofriendly\u2019, what does that mean?\nFor our first album we weren\u2019t really\ntrying to make music to be played on\nthe radio - pop music as such - we were\nmore trying to do our thing which we\u2019d\nbeen doing for years.\nFor the second album, we started\nlistening to a lot more 80s pop mu-sic, stuff that people would call cheesy\n- Magic FM was all I listened to for\nabout 18 months. It probably rubbed\noff on our music but you could ask\nsomeone else in the band and they\u2019d\nprobably snarl at the idea of Magic FM.\nFor me though, when I\u2019m writing I try\nand think of songs which would sound\ngood next to a Phil Collins song.\nWhat are your favourite bands\nright now?\nI\nda Maria is fast making a name\nfor herself in the indie scene,\nsurrounded by tales of intense\nperfrmances and wrecked stag-es. Music Felix caught up with\nher for a nice chat and a sit-down.\nTell me a bit about yourself\nI\u2019m from a small town in the middle\nof Norway called Nesna. There\u2019s 2000\npeople there or something \u2013 not that\nmany people doing music. My father\nand some of his friends were into it so\nI used to play with my dad\u2019s jazz band.\nHe\u2019s in a reggae band now.\nWhat encouraged you to get serious about music?\nIt was not a deliberate choice. I tried to\ndo all this other stuff. I tried to study,\nI was studying music, philosophy and\nliterature. But I just needed to go on\ntour, so it was a bit like, OK this is what\nI am supposed to do.\nTours are kind of a two sided-thing,\nit\u2019s very intense but I love it. I think I\u2019ve\nnever been as happy in my life as I am\nnow, I\u2019m really really enjoying it\nCan you give me a few words to\ndescribe your music?\nEnergetic, colourful, full of contrasts,\nspiky, sugary. I\u2019ve found that whenever\nyou try to put music into categories it\ndoesn\u2019t fit. It\u2019s much more interesting\nto hear how other people would describe my music.\nWhat kind of venues do you prefer\nto play in?\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what size the venue is\nor how many people show up or if the\nsound is good or bad or whatever. The\nonly thing that matters is being able to\nmeet people. Play music and see what\nhappens.\nWhat was it like to play on Jools\nHolland?\nIt was really cool, it was a fantastic ex-perience, really enjoyable. Jools was a\nvery nice guy. I met Morrissey and he\nstank of aftershave. He seemed very\ntired. It was very good to be there. It\nwas totally different to a live venue. In\na venue you can relax a bit more. It\u2019s\ncool to play on TV, but of course the\nsound is different and you miss the\naudience \u2013 you\u2019re playing to so many\npeople you can\u2019t see. We\u2019ve been on\nTV and on the radio, and you never get\nyour head around the fact that so many\npeople are going to see it or hear it. It\u2019s\nsurreal. I heard myself on the radio to-day, I didn\u2019t see it was me, it felt like\nsomeone else.\nWhere do you get the best\nreception?\nPlaying here in the UK is really cool. I\ncan\u2019t really say which countries I like\nthe best, they are all just different.\nSwedish and Norwegian audiences get\nreally really drunk before they go to\nconcerts.\nYour latest single \u2018Stella\u2019 is about\nGod falling in love with a prostitute and so on. Where did the idea\nfor this song come from?\nI wrote that song at Christmas. I was\nso tired of Christmas, the whole restrictive tradition, the cosiness and the\nwarmth that was there just because it\nwas that time of year. I just wanted to\ndiscuss God, put him down on Earth\nand see what happens.\nInterview by Peter Sinclair\nI like a lot of American bands at the\nmoment. I like bands like Yaysayer,\nGang Gang Dance, Vampire Weekend\nand Dirty Projectors. They don\u2019t make\npop music as such but they put elements of West African music into their\nown stuff which hasn\u2019t been done really\nsince Paul Simon. I just like bands who\nare fucking with the idea of a pop song\nand who aren\u2019t following the rules.\nIs that more the direction in which\nyou\u2019re trying to take your music?\nIn a way the album we\u2019ve just made is\nmore straightforward, a kind of a guitar album, whereas on the first record\nwe were trying to make really complex,\nlayered music. This album felt like\nsomething we had to do, but on the\nthird album we might go a bit weird\nagain. We\u2019ll have to see...\nWhen\u2019s that going to be\nrecorded?\nGod knows! We\u2019re probably going to\nbe touring until Christmas so I don\u2019t\nknow. There\u2019s talk amongst us of moving to America, setting up camp over\nthere and seeing what happens. We\u2019ve\nbeen in London for a long time and I\u2019m\nup for seeing what living somewhere\nelse can inspire out of us.\nInterview by Roman Hochuli\nFrom Nesna to Camden: Ida Maria met up with Felix before her Barfly gig\nIda Maria. Not Tomo\u2019s mum\nMystery Jets at The Engine Room, Brighton\n\n"

    "content": "18 felix Friday 2 May 2008\nArtistic explorations with my iPod\nEmily Wilson might have found the Next Big Thing in art galleries: downloadable podcast audio tours. But\nwill small children, inane Americans, absent paintings and questionable music be their downfall?\nY\nou may have noticed in my\narticles that I have somewhat of a grudge against\nthe audioguides offered\nby art galleries. Now that\naccess to the major museums and galleries is free, they seem keen to extract\nyour money by pressing their overpriced handsets upon you. And then\nyou spend an hour being patronised\nand listening to panpipe music. But fret\nnot, reader, there is a solution! Several\nof the major galleries have their own\npodcasts, which you can easily find\nfree on their websites, and offer guided\ntours which you can download to your\niPod (or equivalent portable music de-vice) then listen to at home or in the\ngallery at your leisure. We can finally\nbe selective about how much panpip-ing we need, and without paying a\npenny. However, let\u2019s not get overex-cited. There is clearly opportunity for\nan informative and useful service here,\nbut are these podcast tours any good?\nI set out with my little pink iPod nano\nto find out.\nWhile all the galleries have up-and-running podcasts, there aren\u2019t many\nart tours available specifically. I found\nthree to review; two at Tate Modern and one at The National Gallery.\nI downloaded all of these through\niTunes, but even at this early stage I\nhad problems. I was unable to get the\nintroduction to the National Gallery\ntour to download automatically, and\nhad to get it directly from their website\nand stick it in my iPod as a song. And\nthen the tour seemed to start off with\npainting number four. Oh well...\nI started out my day at Tate Modern. I\ndecided to kick off with \u2018Modern Paint\u2019,\na tour about art techniques and con-servation, in particular how different\ntypes of paint have been used by different artists. The first painting, according to my podcast list, was \u2018Forgotten\nHorizon\u2019 by Salvador Dali. OK, where\nis it? I assumed it would be alongside\nthe other Surrealist works. It wasn\u2019t.\nI wandered round and round but\ncouldn\u2019t find it. We were off to a bad\nstart, but I decided to press on. Painting number two was \u2018The Fig Leaf\u2019 by\nFrancis Picabia. I couldn\u2019t find it, presumably because it\u2019s been moved to\nthe current exhibition \u2018Duchamp, Man\nRay and Picabia\u2019. And then I couldn\u2019t\nfind the third painting either. This was\nnot good progress.\nBut the work by Cy Twombly I\ncould find. Let\u2019s face it, after wandering round and round searching for an\nhour, I was getting pretty familiar with\nwhat was there. The podcast is inter-esting. The speaker is an expert on art\nconservation, and I\u2019m impressed by\nhow much she can tell just by looking\nat a painting, including the size of all\nthe brushes he used. She points out\ndetails I\u2019d never have noticed on my\nown, including cracks and damage to\nthe paintwork. She talks about how\nher team attempts to repair this dam-age, and how they clean the canvas. I\u2019m\nfascinated by this whole new side of art\ngalleries which I knew nothing about.\nThe same is true of the podcasts for\nthe other paintings \u2013 all thoroughly\ninteresting and enjoyable. Some of the\npaintings I wouldn\u2019t even have given\na second glance to before. I always\nthough Mark Rothko\u2019s blocks of colour\nwere dull and simple, but now I\u2019m seeing the detail and complex techniques\nthat went into his work.\nSo the podcasts I adore. But there are\nwhole chunks of the tour I lose out on\nbecause I can\u2019t find the painting, or it\nsimply isn\u2019t there. Clearly the podcast\nsuffers from featured works being put\ninto storage or loaned out to other gal-leries. Even if it is there, in some cases I\nhave no way of knowing what I\u2019m looking for. Finding a Picasso or a Matisse\nis easy, but do you know what works by\nCy Twombly and Fiona Rae look like?\nI\u2019d recommend tracking down the images online before you go. Something\nthat helped me immensely was the revelation that Tate Modern has touchscreen computers where you can look\nup locations of different artists\u2019 work.\nI could have kissed the screen. Had I\nknown of these magical machines in\nadvance, they\u2019d have been my first port\nof call.\nI use these computers during my\nnext tour, called the \u2018Raw Canvas Onlookers\u2019 tour, which I think is more\naimed at young people. It\u2019s basically\nmembers of the public talking about\nwhat they think of the art. I start off\nby listening to the section about Matisse\u2019s \u2018The Snail\u2019, which I have seen already today. I have to listen to a bunch\nof school kiddies giggling and making\nsuch contributions as \u201cI had a snail on\nmy hand once, and it left white stuff\nall over me\u201d. Hum. There a couple of\nmusical contributions \u2013 the one for the\nRothko I already saw was a pretty tune,\nbut didn\u2019t seem to reflect the painting\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\n\u201cThere are a\ndisproportionate\nnumber of\nsmooth-talking\nAmericans\u201d\n\u2018The Rokeby Venus\u2019, one of the highlights of The National Gallery\u2019s \u2018Be Inspired\u2019 podcast tour. Because who isn\u2019t inspired by naked women?\nMark Rothko. Clearly a rubbish artist if this is all he does, right? Wrong! It\u2019s actually very cunning and technical stuff, according to the podcast\n\n"

    "content": "news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nFriday 2 May 2008 felix\nNews\nOutspoken Asian politician visits IC\nPrime Minister of Malaysian accused of anti-semitism and supporting terror. IC accused of censorship\nAndrew Somerville\nDeputy & News Editor\nAccusations of censorship, racism,\njustification of terrorism and heavy-handed College action have surrounded a high-profile visit to IC by Tun Dr\nMahathir Mohamad, former prime\nminister of Malaysia. Furore around\nwhat was to be his first public speech\nin the UK left international media,\nVIPs, invited guests and a crowd of\nnon-Imperial attendees barred from\nentering the Sir Alexander Fleming\n(SAF) building as Friday\u2019s event was\nrestricted at the last minute to CollegeID holders only.\nThe decision was taken only hours\nbefore the event by the College Secretary, Dr Rodney Eastwood, along with\nan attempt to ban all cameras and recording equipment from the lecture\ntheatre, in order to quell fears of protest over some of Dr Mahathir\u2019s controversial and outspoken comments in\nrecent years, some of which have been\nlabelled racist and anti-semitic. The\ndecision has drawn widespread criticism of College from the Malaysian\nnews media and from many attendees\nangry at having to cancel their plans\nand travel arrangements.\nEven after the tension surrounding\nthe run-up to the event, Dr Mahathir\nmanaged to add considerably to the\naftermath by apparently justifying the\nSeptember 11th attacks, and Osama\nbin Laden\u2019s terrorist activities under\nthe Al Qaeda banner, as acting in \u201cselfdefence.\u201d These comments were made\nduring the Q&A session, and repeated\nwhen asked to clarify his position by a\nmember of the audience:\n\u201cWhen people are desperate, they do\ndesperate things. Before, there was no\nAl Qaeda, no Osama bin Laden. They\ncame after, and for a simple reason: it is\ntheir only way to defend themselves.\u201d\nFigurehead of Debate\nOrganised over the Easter break on the\ntopic of \u201cThe Case for Criminalising\nWar\u201d by ICU\u2019s Political Philosophy Society (no stranger to controversy after\ntheir problematic Israel/Palestine conflict case study earlier this year), the\nevent was a prestigious engagement for\nan ICU society to host; Dr Mahathir\nis a world leader in the movement to\ncriminalise war.\nDr Mahathir is the longest serving Malaysian Prime Minister (serv-ing for 22 years between 1981-2003),\nwinning great support in the east for\nrapidly modernising Malaysia. He was\nconsidered one of the most influential\nand respected leaders in Asia: an outspoken critic of western governments\n(especially the US) and successfully\nmitigating much of the damage done\nto Malaysia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, going against the advice\nof the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF). However, he has attracted wide\ncriticism over Malaysia\u2019s corruption,\nethnically biased policies and institutional racism, and over anti-semitic\ncomments that he made in speeches. In\n1997 he accused Jews for the devaluation of the Mayalsian Ringgit currency,\nsaying: \u201cThe Jews robbed the Palestinians of everything, but in Malaysia they\ncould not do so, hence they do this, depress the ringgit,\u201d later issuing a partial\nretraction. In 2003 he also accused the\nJews of \u201cruling the world by proxy.\u201d\nOn the Wednesday before the event,\nthe ICU President, Stephen Brown, received a complaint from the Jewish Society, after they and the PPS were made\naware of Dr Mahathir\u2019s comments by a\nposter on the Live! (live.cgcu.net) news\nforum. JSoc\u2019s complaint was resolved\nby the PPS meeting Dr Mahathir\u2019s secretary and ensuring that his speech\nremained on the topic of criminaliz-ing war, and contained no anti-semitic\nincitement.\nFollowing the complaint, however,\nthe Union President held a meeting\nwith the College Secretary, who had\nalready sought legal advice over concerns about potentially breaching the\nRacial & Religious Hatred Act should\nDr Mahathir make such comments at\nthe event. College was legally advised\nthat cancelling the event was potentially against the laws protecting free\nspeech. College representatives ordered the PPS to ensure that no recording equipment was present, and\nincreased security so that no external\nVIPs or visitors were allowed in to\nthe audience. Felix was present at the\nevent when the subsequent decision\nto attempt to ban all still-cameras was\nalso taken, but proved impossible to\nenforce.\nThe actions of College have been\ncriticised by many commentators over\ntheir perceived over-zealous and \u2018kneejerk\u2019 response to the situation, especially from students who attended the\nevent and international media. Much\nanger has also been directed at Ammar\nWaraich, the PPS President, over both\nthe original booking of Dr Mahathir,\nand over his forced announcement\nthat only IC-ID holders would be allowed to attend at such short notice.\nSeveral commentators felt that College\nhad abandoned its students in seeking to suppress an extremely interesting and prestigious event, and that a\n\u201cWorld Class\u201d institution such as Imperial does not allow its students the\nsame level of real-world education and\ndebate that comparative British universities such as Oxford, Cambridge,\nKing\u2019s and LSE.\n\u201cWho can we invite to speak without\nbeing overruled by the University?\u201d\nAmmar asked Felix during the after-math, \u201cHow can we prevent external\nstudents becoming interested in our\nevents? Why weren\u2019t we [the PPS]\ninvolved at any point of the decision-making process? College never seemed\nto think or care about the personal issues involved, or about what we are\ntrying to achieve.\u201d\nAlthough contentious and full of de-bate, all of the students that attended\nthat Felix spoke to were pleased that\nit occurred. \u201cEven though I disagreed\nwith his opinions,\u201d said one student,\n\u201crational debate, and being exposed to\nviews on global events is a refreshing\nexperience at Imperial. We rarely see\nthe wider issues, even though we are\nconstantly told that our university produces world leaders in many influential\nfields: not just in science.\u201d\nDr Mahathir answers questions from a packed SAF audience whilst crowds wait outside\nImperial College Vs.

BUSA is\nthe highlight of the judo calendar and\nthe club has been building up towards\nit for the last couple of months. For the\nfirst time ever, due to the split from\nthe University of London, Imperial\nentered their own team for the team\ncompetitions.\nAfter a 4 hour coach journey and the\nweigh-in on Friday evening, everyone\nwent to a Chinese buffet in order to\nstack up some energy for the fights.\nWith full stomachs, we quickly found\nour hotel and went to bed because\nthe fights in the lower weight categories were due to start early the next\nmorning.\nAfter a small breakfast on Saturday\nmorning, our lightweights took the\ntram over to the venue. We had to be\nearly because the fights in the individual pools began in weight order with\nthe U-60 Dan and Kyu grades going\nfirst.\nIn the highly competitive U-66 male\nDan category, Ed (1st Dan) got second\nin his pool and went to the knockout\nstage. Next on the mat were Hugh (1st\nKyu) and Rahul (1st Dan) in the U-73\nmale Dan category. With nine pools of\nthree, the entry for this category was\nthe highest at the tournament. Needless to say, competition was fierce. Unfortunately, Hugh was unlucky to get a\nvery strong pool with a 1st Dan and a\n2nd Dan player and could not make it\nto the knockouts. Rahul won both his\nfights against players from Manchester\nand Bedfordshire with Ippon, which\nbrought him to the top of his pool\nand to the knockouts. With his hand\ninjured from Sheffield USIST, Eugene\n(U-100) was unable to get past the pool\nstage. Claudia, our only female entry\n(U-57 Dan), missed the second place needed to proceed to the knockouts in\na close match with a Yuko score.\nFor the Kyu grades Imperial had two\nentries. Wilhelm (U-66) scored three\nIppons which took him to the knock-outs. Ben (U-81) won two fights with\nIppon against higher grades from Warwick and Brunel and also went to the\nknockout stage.\nIn the afternoon, the knockouts\nstarted. Because of the huge number of\ncontestants in this category, the U-73\nmale Dan grades were to fight first.\nRahul was able to continue his formidable display by a clear 1.31 minute\nIppon win over a 3rd Dan from Bath.\nThe next fight was a close match with\nboth players being very strong. After\ngoing the full distance of 5 minutes,\nRahul lost due to a Yuko score. However, since his opponent from Hertfordshire went on to fight in the final,\nRahul got another chance to fight in\nthe \u2018repechage\u2019. After another win over\na player from Edinburgh, Imperial was\nclose to its first medal.\nNevertheless, the fight for Bronze\nwas going to be tough. Rahul was leading with a waza-ari, but the opponent\nkept pushing him off the mat and Rahul had to make sure he would not lose\nthe fight on penalties. In the end, Rahul\u2019s experience and stamina got us the\nBronze medal. Sadly, having lost his\nfirst fight in the knockouts to a strong\nBath player, Ed did not get a chance to\nfight in the repechage.\nFor the Kyu grades, Wilhelm, after\nhaving escaped a hold-down five seconds before the clock, lost due to a second waza-ari by his opponent. However, since the player from Southampton\nwent on to fight for Gold, he got another chance to fight for Bronze. After\na quick Ippon over the judoka from\nBath, Imperial had its second Bronze\nmedal. Then Ben was on against Alex\nfrom ULU. Unfortunately, only one of\nus could fight in the semi-finals. Alex\nwon the fight by Ippon and went on to\nwin the Bronze medal for ULU.\nAfter a long day of fighting we all\nwent to Nandos for dinner. We were\njoined by Liang who had graduated\nfrom Imperial last year.\nSo for the first time ever, Imperial\nwould enter its own team. Unsurprisingly, we only had a male team. The\nmale teams consisted of 5 players\nfighting in weight order. For Imperial\nEugene (-100), Ben (-81), Hugh (-73),\nRahul (-73) and Edouard (-66) fought\nin the team competitions.\nThe Imperial team came second in a\nstrong pool with Oxford and Newcastle. This meant that we were to fight\nCambridge next. With Eugene, Rahul\nand Ed winning their fights, we went on\nto fight Bath in the semi-finals. Despite\ngood fights, Imperial was outweighed\nand outclassed by Bath. However, since\nBath went on to win the finals, Imperial got the chance to fight for Bronze\nagainst Warwick.\nThe first one to fight was Eugene. Albeit increasingly serious pain from his\nwrist, he fought extremely well and laid\nthe foundations for the bronze medal\nwith 10 points. Ben and Hugh fought\nwell too but had to give in to stronger\nopponents. Rahul continued to show\nhis skill and while in the lead, caught\nhis opponent shortly before the clock\nwith an excellent foot sweep. We were\nback in the game. If Ed won, we were\ngoing to get Bronze. Fighting a heavier\nand stronger opponent this was no easy\ntask. Again, Ed showed some amazing\nJudo against an increasingly passive\nWarwick player. After having violated\nvarious rules the Warwick player was\ndisqualified for 4 shidos in a row and\nImperial had won.\nICJC thanks everyone involved and\nespecially Alex from ULU for booking\nthe hotel.\nThe Judo team with their medals\nJudo chop time (sorry, I know it\u2019s a bad joke!)\n\n"

Excellent Slitherinking! Perfectly hand-drawn answer\ntoo sir. All the best for this week\u2019s\none. We\u2019ll give a prize out in the\nsummer. The more entries, the better your chances.\nHow to play:\nCrudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar to Minesweeper mixed with a\ndash of Sudoku.\nThe object of the game is to draw\nlines between the dots to create one\nlong, and most importantly, looping\nline. It should have no start or finish;\njust like an elastic band.\nEach number indicates how many\nlines should be drawn around it, for\nexample:\nCells which don\u2019t contain a number\ncan be surrounded by any number of\nlines.\nRemember, the line must form a\nloop, so the line cannot branch. The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most\ncommon place to start on a Slitherlink grid is by drawing crosses\naround any zeros. Drawing crosses\nis purely done to so that you know\nwhere there can\u2019t possibly be a line.\nSo, take the pattern below as an ex-ample. Begin by drawing crosses,\nthen by filling in some lines:\nNow the lines can only continue in\nthe following directions:\nSlitherlink 1,401\n3\n2 2\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\n1,400 solution\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\n2\n3\n1\n1\n2\nTEXT US!

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nFriday 2 May 2008 felix\nComment\nA. Geek\nLetters to Felix\nDear Felix,\nQuick email:\nI don\u2019t appreciate the article you published last week [issue 1,399; presumably the one titled \u2018The Farcity of Varsity\u2019\nby [...] \u2013 Editor] and this [issue 1,400;\ntitled \u2018Presenting the footballer\u2019 by Linnearse \u2013 Editor] having a go at football\nclub.\nFreedom of speech is great... blah\nblah, but things are getting a bit\nslanderous.\nJust purely from the Club\u2019s point of\nview, if freshers who didn\u2019t join this\nyear were thinking about doing so\nTarnishing the\nFootball Club\u2019s\nreputation\nnext, then you\u2019re putting them off.\nI know you have a load of faceless\narticles each week, but being able to\nsay all this crap without publishing\nyour name removes any accountability,\nso they can do it freely with no reper-cussions. Imagine if I decided to use a\npseudonym to slag off Choir soc and\ncall them a bunch of boring, lifeless\ngimps. How well would that go down?\nIt would be rude, unfair and tarnishing a whole group of people unfairly.\nYou published the homophobic article\n(of which nothing came and yet we\u2019ve\nhad to endure comments about it all\nyear), now you throw this in, together\nwith last week\u2019s little dig too. Why?\nIs there nothing better for Felix to do\nthan damage the image of the football\nClub?\nWho wrote the article?\nRegards,\nThose who are about to revise\nGaro Torossian\nFootball Club Captain\nDear Garo,\nI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t appreciate the article published in issue 1,400, written\nby Linnearse. His column is intended to\nbe a satirical piece sending up the various \u2018collectives\u2019 around Imperial, to be\ntaken with a pinch of salt. Certainly, we\nreceived no similar complaints when\nthe depiction of the \u2018Finance tart\u2019 was\npublished two weeks earlier.\nIn answer to your other statements,\nwe were perfectly entitled to, and in my\nopinion, perfectly correct to publish the\narticle reporting on homophobic chanting in the Union. Our sources were\nclearly upset by what they\u2019d heard and\nit was definitely within the public interest to report on the incident.\nI find your claims that [Insert Witty\nName]\u2019s article was \u201ca little dig\u201d at the\nFootball Club slightly absurd. In the ar-ticle, the author originally didn\u2019t know\nwhich sports club he/she was writing\nabout, demonstrating his/her general\napathy towards sports clubs rather\nthan one in particular. The article itself\nwas more about the lack of recognition\nthat the Arts receive at Imperial, in\ncomparison with something like sport,\nrather than an attack on any club in\nparticular.\nThese comment pieces were sent to\nFelix without request. Perhaps this is\nsomething you should consider, that\npeople are using Felix to voice their\nopinions; opinions that happen to criticise your club.\nI refute your question that Felix has\n\u201cnothing better to do than damage the\nimage of the Football Club?\u201d. Rather\nthan addressing the comments in the\narticles, you\u2019ve chosen to take it up with\nFelix. Yes, we choose whether to publish\nthe articles but we don\u2019t necessarily\nagree with them. Furthermore, there\nwere two letters responding to [Insert\nWitty Name]\u2019s article which we published in issue 1,400 which raised some\nperfectly valid counter arguments,\nsomething you could have done if you\nwished.\nI think you\u2019ve answered the question of why people write anonymously,\nwith your final line: \u201cWho wrote the\narticle?\u201d Articles are written under a\npseudonym because the authors want\nto make a point without fear of being\nmauled afterwards. Whilst I don\u2019t personally agree with writing anonymous-ly, I can understand why people do it,\nand without it many of the pages within\nFelix would make for far duller reading.\nFinally, I\u2019m not at liberty to reveal the\nauthors\u2019 identities.\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nOverheard conversation\nDavid Stewart\nT\nwo girls sit in the Maths\nlibrary. Girl A is filing her\nnails. Girl B appears to be\ncopying out Girl A's work.\nGirl A: Make sure you change the order or wha'ever so it doesn't look like\nit's the same.\nGirl B: I know, I am, look I put 'x plus x'\nhere instead of '2x'. How's Steve?\nGirl A: We had a fight the other day.\nGirl B: Oh, no! Was it about that night\nwhen you got Big John to hold back\nyour hair while you puked when you'd\nhad all that Aftershock and told Simon\nthat you thought he was fit?\nGirl A: No. I haven't told him about\nthat. It was 'cos I wanted to go out and\nhe was just playing with his Wii.\nGirl B: Was that on Saturday?\nGirl A: Yeah.\nGirl B: You've got to go out on a Saturday. Is this an alpha or an a?\nGirl A: Umm. Dunno, I copied it off\nLisa. Try and make it look like both.\nGirl B: Shouldn't it be 2a anyway? Because you have to multiply by 2 when\nyou differentiate, don't you?\nGirl A: Not always. Only if there's a\nsquared in it or wha'ever.\nGirl B: Are you going to break up with\nhim for ever? You could go out with Simon then.\nGirl A: Maybe, yeah. Except Julie B\ntold me that he snogged Samantha last\nnight.\nGirl B: No!\nGirl A: I know.\nGirl B: But she's so \u2026\nGirl A: I know \u2026\nGirl B: She's like, literally, the only person I know that does her own work.\nGirl A: And she's putting on weight.\nyou could see where her belt was cutting into her gut flab on Friday.\nGirl B: People shouldn't go out like\nthat. What's this word here?\nGirl A: Point.\nGirl B: And this?\nGirl A: Inflection.\nGirl B: And this?\nGirl A: Of.\nGirl B: What's a point of inflection?\nGirl A: I think it's something you dif-ferentiate. What did you do on Saturday, anyway?\nGirl B: Went out.\nGirl A: Where?\nGirl B: Justin's party.\nGirl A: Is he the one with the tattoo?\nGirl B: He's got more than one. He was\nplaying drinking games with the guys\nwith chocolate vodka and he basically\nshowed us all of them. It was mental. I\nthink there are pictures on facebook.\nGirl A: I can't go on facebook at the\nmoment because that weird guy, you\nknow, James, keeps poking me. He'll\nprobably see me in Online Now and\nthen he'll know I know he's poked\nme and I'll have to poke him back or\nsomething. Then he'll start writing on\nmy wall and Simon might see. Stuff like\nthat.\nGIrl B: Is this graph supposed to look\nlike a V or a curvy V?\nGirl A: Just draw it really small.\nGirl B: Oh my God! Did you hear about\nVicks?\nGirl A: No.\nGirl B: Lisa said she's had sex with her\ntutor and he gave her chlamydia and\nshe threatened to sue him or wha'ever\nunless he gave her free lessons and did\nall her work for her.\nGirl A: Oh my God! Is that her tutor\nfor Methods?\nGirl B: Yeah\nGirl A: That's good. It's due in on Friday and no-one\u2019s done it yet.\nGirl B: I know!\n(All names have been changed\nto protect the identities of those\ndepicted)\nL\nook, let\u2019s cut to the chase\nhere. I don\u2019t have the time\nto write this, you don\u2019t have\nthe time to read it, so I\u2019m going to give you a condensed\nversion of everything that has angered\nme in the last four weeks, and then you\ncan read it and go on not caring. First of\nall, if one more of you comes up to me\nto ask for help with an exam subject,\nafter having spent an entire year being\na slimy and insulting sod, I\u2019m going to\nstart feeding you wrong answers. Let\u2019s\nget one thing straight \u2013 I don\u2019t mind\nyou pissing me off for eleven months\nof the year as long as you keep it up for\nthe twelfth one.\nSecond of all, extra thick bread. I\nmake grilled cheese sandwiches because I\u2019m a mighty warrior of the food\ngrill, not because I like the taste of carbohydrates and leaky dairy products. If\nI buy extra thick bread, I expect to have\nto get a tape measure out to work out\nwhich side to butter. I expect my loaves\nto be partitioned into exactly two slic-es. A note to the Warburton family \u2013 if\nyou ever find yourselves down one of\nKensington\u2019s many mean streets in the\nevening, take a big stick or some burly\nmen because the Masked Griller will\nbe there.\nThird \u2013 actually, let\u2019s stop this. I can\u2019t\nthink of anything good that happened\nover the Easter period at all, so I don\u2019t\nknow where this is leading... Other\nthan the beginnings of a wheat/chaff\nseparation over the river with my City\nfriends, nothing of note happened.\nThe ratio of funerals attended to childhood rivals kicked in the groin grows\nonwards in the wrong direction, revision consists largely of reading things\nI thought I\u2019d read six months ago, and\nthe actual act of revising \u2013 hah! Don\u2019t\neven get me started on that.\nThen there\u2019s this general kind of distaste that other people seem to have for\nyou if you\u2019re a scientist revising around\nthis time of year. The kind of people\nwho say, \u201cLots of money in that!\u201d when\nyou tell them what you\u2019re studying, as\nif careers fairs consist of Whores and\nCocaine stalls interspersed with fat\nmen in suits and top hats with big bags\nof money hanging from their ridiculous moustaches. Around this time\nof year they switch to Ultra Patronising Mode like a particularly exciting\nepisode of the Power Rangers. \u201cIt\u2019s just\nmaths, isn\u2019t it?\u201d they boom, firing lasers\nfrom their eyes. Only this time you\u2019re\nnot allowed to cave their head in with\na broom handle that you\u2019ve engraved a\ndragon\u2019s head on. The judge won\u2019t let\nyou off with a caution twice.\nSo yes, I\u2019m a little down right now.\nBy the time you read this, the London\nElections will be over and you won\u2019t\nhave voted, Boris will be well on his way\nto making you wish you\u2019d never been\nborn, and somehow through that I\u2019ll\nhave to resist starting an underground\nrebel militia and continue memorising\nthese pointless lists of failed research\nprojects. I don\u2019t know how I do it.\nWhat I do know is that in three weeks\nI\u2019ll be free again, and ready to get on\nwith life. What I worry about the people I see cooped up in the library is that\nthey\u2019re never really free of this. This is\nwhat they live for \u2013 study and progress.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not exactly\nMr. \u2018Facebook Event: PoSt-ExAm PiSsUp WAAHEEEY!\u2019 here. But I see a lot\nof people here who have never really\nleft their A-Level days behind them.\nThey\u2019re cramming and regurgitating\nlike John Prescott at a finger buffet, and\ngod knows that\u2019s not healthy. There are\ntwo tricks to revision \u2013 spend five minutes not revising when you should be;\nand spend five minutes revising when\nyou shouldn\u2019t be.\nThat means taking a break from the\nharsh lights of Level 5 in order to actually get outside, where the air is clear,\netcetera, possibly flying a kite. And\nit also means not forgetting that you\nstudy here for the other eleven months\nof the year. Even the freshest faces at\nImperial will be all but done with their\nstudies by the time the next Mayoral\nElection comes around. Think about\nthat carefully for a second this week,\nand ask yourself if you\u2019ve really grown\nup since those days of hushed exam\nhalls and CVG Revision Guides.\n\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\nmaths, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nthey boom firing\nlasers from their\neyes\n\u201d\n\n"
