    "content": "10 FELIX FELIX WEEKEND\nDEADLINE\nWorld Government\nin two generations:\nFederalism\nSpeaking on 'Federalism\u2014a System of World Government' Russell\nJohnston (Liberal MP Inverness) said he found it entirely consistent\nthat he was in his lecture apparently advocating a massive centralisation of Government and that next Wednesday (30 November) he\nwas asking to introduce a Bill giving Home Rule to Scotland.\nThese were both part of Federal ism, a system in which a chain of\ndecision making bodies dealt with problems within their areas with knowledge, concern and in vol v ment. Problems would be dealt with by\nrepresentatives of the people to\nwhom they really meant something.\nThe regional authorities and the\nworld authority would be equal partners with their own sharply den ned area of Government. This method of\nGovernment, achieving freedom for\nindividuals and groups was a particularly liberal one. It recognised the\nexistence of nations and communities within states, each with its own way of achieving liberty and justice for\nits members. There must obviously\nbe universal standards of justice for\npeople regardless of race, creed or\nwealth and these must be safeguarded by the World Authority, however,\nmaintenance of these standards could best be affected by those with inti mate ko wi edge of the particular abuses\nto which their region was most prone.\nThere is no easy formula for\nthe reduction of friction between states, or in fact, between nations\nwithin states. Should a major block\nwish to go against the rest of the\nworld, it would still need to be con fronted by another large block.\nThere is, however, the chance that a statutory system of international relations (such as EEC or UNO) drawn up in the presence of third parties\nwould be better adhered to than the\ne ix sting ad hoc system of treaties and power blocks. Third parties can often see solutions to which the\nquarrelling parties are blind. UNO\nThe basis for such an organisation\nis obviously UNO. The fact that so\nmany people in Europe have managed to forget T'^ eir nationalism to\nthink as Europeans and movements such as UNO and OAU have\nformed means that at last people are\nlooking beyond nationalism. Mr Johnston was confident that such a system of World Government was\nfeasible within two generations.\nLAM LEY'S technical & general\nbooks\nart materials\ndrawing\ninstruments\nstationery\npaperbacks\n1,3 & 5.

Wells Soc\nPrizegiving\nWith the prize giving on Friday9 th December, the Art of Science\nexhibition put up the shutters for an other 2 0 years, when the \"guess the\nchanges\" competition will be judged.\nThe prize giving, a quiet, respect-able affair in Me chEng concourse,\nwas effected in the minimum of time\nand followed by sherry for the 25\npeople present.\nIn converse with the Dean of\nR.C.A., who gave away the prizes,\nit emerged that although impressed\nby the high standard of the \" Art\" exhibits he thought that on the\nwhole the science-inspired works tended to we Heath Robinson and un tidily executed. The exhibit he\npicked out as being particularly good was Phillip Painter's prize winning music entry, (o cm posed by random selection from telephone numbers),\nwhich he said was consistent with the modern-art opinion that ar and om-process creation was often more beautiful than one made by selective\nthought.\nThat the prize giving should have\nbeen held in such an open area a; Me chEng concourse was unfortunate\nas it made the atmosphere very im personal, but otherwise this was a pleasant end to Wells Society's memo rial to H.G.

This was\nthe bald statement made by President Mola m who cast some of the blame on the Geology Dept. for their poor attendance at their departmental dinner.\nThe deficit could have been explained more fully.\nVice President O' Reilly suitably\nhumble, apologised for the presence\nof R.C.S. and Guilds at the Prospect\nof Whitby on Morphy Day. His humility was quite gone, however,\nwhen he tongue-lashed the gathering\nfor the apathy shown towards the\ncollection for the Muscular Dystrophy Research Fund. He urged support\nsupport from more than just the\nhard-core who always support these\nfunctions. Mines men were also urged to support the Foreign Students' visit\nthis week.\nThe 'Stevenson letter' was read to\nthe meeting and Mola m commented that Morphy Day should be retained\n\"as the only time during the year\nwhen the students, as a body, can let their hair down in public\". Comments from the floor substantiated\nthis attitude, it would be interesting\nto know the private views of members of the Union on this issue.\nThe C lem. Auction was squeezed\ninto the remaining part of the meet-ing, bidding was sluggish and the\nhighest price fetched was 32.6 for\none article.

Despite the close result in last\nTuesdays' referendum, there is little\ndoubt that R RCS General Committee will accept the results as final.\nThe referendum was held to decide whether RCS Union should again apply for membership of NUS. The final vote was 349 For' and392 Against with45 abstentions and10 spoilt papers. This represents a majority of 43 against which is less\nthan the abstentions. The total vote of nearly 800 shows that only just\nover half R CSU bothered to vote on\nthis important issue.\nThe general feeling seems to be\nthat this is the end of the issue for\nthis year. The proposer s Mr. Booth man and Mr. Fuchs both accepted\nthe referendum vote as final.

Lord Snow gave an informal lecture, as he said Wells did not approve of formally, and\nspoke of his personal impressions of Wells.\nHe first met him in1934 Wells was the first person to show any interest in a novel LordS now had just written, and asked him to\nlunch to discuss it.

Although well entertained Snow was only invitee to Wills home once,\nperhaps because Wells didn't like\nother mental king to his wife.\nSnow remembered Wells as the inventor and the writer, the man who forecasted the coming of war tanks\nand air battles. In his writings he\ntold of his youth and hopes for a Utopia founded on education and science.\nAlthough Wells is remembered as\na writer he only took up this occupation because of ill health. His ambition was to become a scientist\nan F.R.S. and a Professor Emeritus, However, as his period of good\neducation was short and his health poor his ambition was never fulfilled and this depressed him.

Moon t Southside bar\nbrawl\nA complaint has been received from the staff in Southside Bar about various customers on Swimming Gala night. It seems that the enforced absence of Me ch.Eng.2 from the event, caused by the concurrence of a Departmental dinner, proved sufficient reason for them to disturb the usual tranquil atmosphere\nof the bar and for one member of\nthe party to flout the normal social\ncode in discriminating where he got\nrid of the excess beer he had drunk. However, blame does not rest on the students alone; according to Stan\nthe behaviour of the members of\nstaff present was even worse than\nthat of the students.\nThe duty-officer was called twice,\nonce for nonpayment and the second\ntime, for misconduct. Several threats\nto close the bar were made in an attempt to calm everybody down and at 10 p.m. definite preparations were made for this.\nThe telephone seems to be suffer-ing no ill-effects despite several at tempts to lender it a mischief.\nf.J.

He emphasised\nthat the colleges eligible for membership would have to be approved by Council IC\nwould not want to be swamped by large numbers of external students.\nThe proposal, was discussed at length, br lng hg in reference to organisations such as\nthe Dramatic Societyoar the Opera Group, which depend on external me moers for their productions. The aim was to national is e the present situation where some clubs had\nunofficial members from other colleges and were uncertain of the status and legal position of these people.

Who will replace him?\nVSO is looking now for 1000 graduates\nand professionally qualified volunteers\nfor service from next September\nVOLUNTARY SERVICE OVERSEAS( Member of British Volunteer Programme}\n3 HANOVER STREET LONDON W1\nSi I wood Park\nThe medieval as say er had a simple way of grading that most precious of metals. By rubbing a piece of gold of known purity on\nthe touchstone and comparing the streak with that of the piece in\nquestion, he determined its purity and value. A bit inaccurate and\nhaphazard perhaps, but it served. And so does its modern allegorical\nsubstitute, for at Silwood Park one can rub one's brains against\nanother's and compare the resulting parks. Touchstone provides the\nopportunity, largely lost to technocrats who must deal with arguments that are tor the most part cut and dried, to argue about ab-s traction s, to philo soph is e, to relax and bag gie over questions that\nnave no sim pie answers, or no answers at all. The Park itself is\nthe ideal place for such agar the ring; its serene peacefulness evokes\nthe kind ot emotion that must have prompted men who travelled\nthe world to sentimentalize about green England.\nThe trip from London makes the transition easily. Ugly, dirty industrial central megalopolis occasionally\nrelieved by imaginative architecture\ngives way to the uniform mediocrity that is suburbia with its rows of semi-detached dwellings, neat small gard ens, hedges, small new ish looking cars \u2014 and finally, the countryside it self. Now the contrast is immediate. Greenness and brown ness come through fresh, even in the drizzly cool\nof an autumn afternoon. Green fields,\nframed perpendicular ly by oak and elm, roll through one's peaceful\nstupor. The gates of Sil wood Park loom up to open on the sweep of\na tree-lined drive. A once magnificent\nEnglish country estate, stands on a rise in the land with its skirt of\nlawns stretching majestically away to fields beyond. The house is s or rounded on three sides b v recent additions.\nModern brick structures housing labs\nand living quarters for the residents,\nunfortunately clash with the more\nornate architecture of the house it self. To one side is a unsightly\nhuddle composed of prefab ref rectory and qu onset huts in which, we are\ninformed, we will sleep. The majesty\nof the place lessens with the news.\nTea is served in the library which is reached by passing through the\nmain hall with its high beamed roof\nand hardwood floor, its bricked up fireplace, spaces furniture and genera ll y forbidding air. The library, ho wever is warm and inviting \u2014 inviting too for the sandwiches, cakes and tea spread around. Here, despite the collection of learned biological journals, the atmosphere of the\ncount rv estate U retained. One relaxes and talks easily. The nark and its\nau iet serenity remove the tensions\nof the citv. The mind shifts into\nneutral and idles away happily with inconsequential s. In the small sitting room next\ndoor the a'mos p^ erm is enhanced by great bunches of flowers and ferns\naround the grate. In front the guest\nsneaker, perches uncomfortably on\nthe soap box of free speech (but not,\nas we were informed, of licence) and talks, the touchstone before him on a table.\nHaving concluded, he retreats to an armchair to fend off several attacks on what he has said. The group is lively and arguments range\nfrom semantic difficulties to sound\ncomments.\nWe adjourn for a beer in the great\nhall and then for supper in the low, squat refectory. The roast beef of\nOki e England e accompanied by a Yorkshire pudding of more dubious\norigin is served by a healthy look-ing young wench who distracted at\nleast this visitor's attention from the\ncontinuing argument. Dinner is completed, but the discussion continue\nin groups. Beer meanwhile keeps\nthe tongue lubricated though having a more dubious affect on the mind. The next morning is leisurely, filled\nwith the Sunday papers, talk, or a walk around the estate. From the window at the back of the house\nthere is a view of a small neat\ngarden, encompassed by lawns and large trees. Walking down the\nlawns, one is overwhelmed by the quiet solitude; there are almost\ngroups of Edwardian ladies playing croquet on the smooth grass. This must have been magnificent on sunny summer afternoons with frock\ncoated butlers serving whisky and long cool concoctions made from g in... But push on into the woods and along a narrow path, past ruined chicken coops and occasional botany\nexperiments to the main road, and there\u2014joy!\u2014.is ' The Cannon'. Inside,\nit is all rural England with thick ac cents; hair cropped close at back and sides unkempt on top; roughly clothed workers, playing dominoes on along table, their hands, sun darkened and homy, around pints of beer \u2014\ngood beer here, and a peaceful cigarette while gazing out of the pub window towards the woods that hide the house.\nFrom the woods one comes unexpectedly upon the house, suddenly\nto be plunged again into the last\ncentury. It is raining, and no-one\ne( se is about; the garden is free for\nthe walking and sav our ing of its\nEeace and calm. Too bad about the\nut s and modern touches, too bad...\nIn the afternoon, after lunch, we gather again where we started, and sum up. The conclusions we have\nreached are all remarkably uniform \u2014\ngreat minds..., or do all scientists\ntend to conform? Still, the return to London and reality is a trip home from a spa,\nrejuvenated and refreshed.\n\n"

So said\nOtto Karol yi at the last of his five\nlectures on Music and the Two Cultures. In defining culture, he quoted\nmany sources : for example Matthew Arnold, who said that 'culture is a statement of perfection' ' Cul rus' really means 'adoration of the gods' \u2014 and culture, through the cent-urie s, has always been inextricably\nlinked with religion. In the words of\nthe famous psychologist William James ' all art embodies some\nelement ot myth'. In fact nearly alle any art, painting and music, Was\not a religious nature; the work of a Medieval composer was as much worship as art.\nin tact even in the20 th century\nwe have our 'cults'; one ot those\nthat Mr. Karol yi pointed out as being\nCherry's Concrete\nConcepts\nThe primary function of language\nis not communication, but the' concr et iz ation of concepts', stated Professor Cherry in his recent General Studies lecture. A great gulf exists\nbetween man and beast, he pointed\nout, because of this. While animals\ncan communicate, concepts are beyond them. A bee waggles its\nal xl on menat a rate inversely proportional to it distance from the nearest\npollen source, in tli is way conveying vital information to its neighbour; but \u2014 and we must take Professor\nCherry' sword on this \u2014 a bee is in capable of even a mental concept\nof pollen, let alone a reasoned discussion on the subject. For parents\ndriven insane by their child's babbling he found a message of hope in this. It pays dividends; baby is\nconcr et i zing his concepts. This gives\nhim the power to do more than just\nwaggle his abdomen, in time; he can also talk about it, or consider i t.He has a concept cf it. Professor Cherry laid great stress\non this. He pointed out that such\nconcepts vary from one culture to another. For a Russian the word' red' evokes thoughts of heroism, for an Englishman, merely thoughts of\nblood; and not only our concepts of\nwords, but our habits, our customs,\nand our emotional traits are bound up in our national culture, and thus,\nin our language. For this reason, it would, unfortunately, be futile for the world to le am English. While tho average Chinese could speak simple\nEnglish, the rift between Asian and British culture is so wide, that the subtleties inherent in English concepts would be too much for him. When pressed for evidence to support his idea of the mindlessness of\nanimals. Professor Cherry answered that he himself was quite capable of sleepwalking to the lavatory without utilizing his concept of it, by sheer\nforce of habit. Animals, even when awake, do everything like this, with out thinking. Several disbelieving\nVoices were raised at his astounding\nclaim of instinctive direction finding;\nbut at this promising point discussion\nended. ,\nJ. Mulialy\ntypical ot Western' Culture' is the tendency to eu log is e the interpreter\nof a work of art, rather than the creator \u2014 tor example the conductor\nof a piece of music rather than the composer, or the newspaper art critics, in fact, he said, some news papers use their journalists as ' cult ii gur es' for advertising \u2014 and he cited an example of railway stations where huge pictures of these in eli vi dual s stare down at you from advertisements tor their papers.\nHe went on to discuss certain\ncommon features in the way artists\nand scientists think, to show that\nculture is common to all\u2014scientists,\ntoo, have aesthetic experiences, inspirations when they conceive a new idea. Kepler was a good example of\na scientist whose theories were initially intuitive. In fact, he said,\nboth science and art were conscious\npursuits of beauty: in the words of\nKeats 'Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty...'\nManagement amateurs-Touchstone\nBritish management is 'd is re put able, ne pot is tic, conservative, and\namateurish compared to that in\nthe USA and Germany. This,\naccording to Mr J.P. Carruthers,\na lecturer at LSE, has been the\nfact, that has been responsible\nfor the Trades Unions' continued,\nassociation with the Labour\nParty.\nMr Carr uther s was sneaking at the Touchstone Weekend34 December. He also rr it ici spd the Trade Union c Vict urc for being 'too democratic' \u2014\nthis meant that it was impossible to\nhave a unanimously approved policy,\nan el that the General Secretary's position was too vulnerable since sudden ote-election scandals could easily\ntopple him. The Government, also,\ncame in for some criticism \u2014 it had gone loo far with its deflation a rv measures and the inevitable result\nwould be a rise in unemployment to over a million. Both unions and employers do their bes^ to keep the Government out of their consultations\u2014this is\nevident from the fact that only about\n2 0 % of workers in Britain have minimum wages fixed by law \u2014 in the USA foi example nearly all minimum wages are controlled.\nFour of the people present were\nin fact Trades Union members \u2014\nmature students on Trade Union scholarships at LSE \u2014 and the remaining eleven were from IC.

C EDITOR'Somme nt One is one.\nWe are SO good\nIt is a dismaying experience to realise just how inward looking this\nUnion is. That the College as a whole should choose to isolate itself\nfrom the National Student body is\npuzzling enough, but when Iam told by some of our clear thinking, rational Guilds men that the RCS de bates on NUS are of no concern to\nthe m,I confess myself to be be wild ered. Are they really so short-sighted\nor do they actually believe that if Guilds' considered joining that different arguments would apply? Members of the Union complain that\nFELIX has given too much space to the NUS debates\u2014perhaps they\nwould rather have more space de voted to the really significant events\nof the Union's calendar. There are those interesting incidents of Morphy Day or the Lord Mayor's Show, which show the full extent of the students'\ngood relations with the public or there is the petty backbiting that has\ngone on in RCS this term. Such is\nthe Union's consciousness of its role\nin national student affairs that it considers NUS to be of small concern.\nImperial College is the foremost\ntechnological institution in the country, it is famous for its distinguished academic staff, the superb\nHalls of Residence and its 'sweat\ncattle markets'. When the College was mentioned in conversation at\nthe Margate conference, however, the delegates were puzzled about the Union's attitude. ' Why is IC so disinterested in national student affairs?\"\nand' Silly' were the comments. Perhaps we are so good that we can be a law unto ourselves... perhaps not. Time and again the title ' University of South Kensington' is raised in publications, broadcasts and governmental circles, IC is well known and acknowledged throughout Europe and the world as something different,\nsomething special. But how many students realise the esteem in which the College is held and compare it with the respect due to our Union? Time and again I find that for so\nmany people this is just a super-technical college.\nINTERESTED IN: TANKS\nTELEPATHY TUT ANKH A MEN Then come to the HALDANE\nLIBRARY\n13 Princes Gardens for a book about it. Open ll7 pm. daily(115.30) Monday& Wednesday The Piggery\nCOL CUT T Looking around\nTheN US question has been settled for another year, I hope. As I said\nin an earlier issue, one of the failings of this type of argument at IC is\nthat few people take the trouble to find out the facts of the matter, and\nprepare a reasonable argument for, or against. Many were, therefore,\nheartened to see the points for both sides published in the last issue of\n' i\" ELL X'. However, a closer examination of these points shows that they\nmight not be as sound as they appear. For example : ' 3 MP's have told us ...the rise w. ll definitely be in the for mola loan'. A pretty powerful argument. Unfortunately, when the national press showed interest in this statement and enquired of Martin Lack the identity of these three\nMP's, it transpired that he knew definitely of one, and, if there was one, there would probably be more, and anyway, three sounds better than one.\n1 Mr. Lack doesn't know the identity of the one MP and can't remember who told him. As one or two people will be aware, there exists in IC Union a system\nof Union Duty Officers. This system is designed to ensure that behaviour n the Union bars is not unduly bad, and that the Union is closed at the\nappointed hour. The Duty Officers themselves are all solid, distinguished,\nleading members ot the Union, carefully chosen for their ability to look\nafter awkward bar situations (in other words, the Deputy President just\n\u2022 ut s all society chairmen and other worthies on a rota). This is fine, or\nwould be if the Duty Officers ever bothered to turn up. The Duty Officers'\nbooks in Southside and the Union show that very few do bother. Is two nights a term in the bar really too onerous a task ? Some deli que nt D.O.'s agree that it is not, but that they never received notification that they\nwere supposed to be on duty. Finger out, McBain! Once again, the Ents. Committee is the object of general criticism in t ne Union. The complaints are many and various, but most are on the theme of lack of co-operation with societies trying to organise hops, both over the arrangements for the hops themselves and in the stocking of the Crush Hall bar.Ents. had a very bad start to the year, and Bold on and Guy did well to step in when they did and try to do something about it. Are they still trying as hard or have they become bored with the job ?\nAs Col cut t casually glances round the College looking for some likely fellow whose failings and/ or idiosyncrasies might conceivably fill another\ncolumn inch, he cannot help noticing a certain college administrator, who shall be nameless. It suffices to say that he is also warden of one of the Southside halls. Amongst other things, this august gentleman has a dog, which he regularly exercises (without a lead) in Princes Gardens, quite\noblivious of the notices on the gates which say ' Dogs must be kept on a lead. By Order.' Perhaps the secretary to the Parks and Gardens Committee, Mr.C. C. Seaford, could bring this notice to the attention of the\ngentleman concerned.\nSir,\nMay1, through your column, appeal to those members of the Union who insist upon making the upper lounge into an absolute pig ger y every\nlunchtime to at least return it to\nits initial state before leaving. This room, placed as it is at the top of the Union, is ideally suited to its\nactual purpose of providing a quiet\nplace oi relaxation \u2014 however, this is\nimpossible due to its permanent worse than slum condition.\nWhile considering the3 rd floor of the Union may I suggest that the table tennis club apply for a supplementary grant or something to cover the cost of either a fan or respirators for those who pass through..... r B.O. saturated club room?? Roderick J. Red may ne\\ j ttt lA A to fELIX\nPolitics, bias\nand Match\nSir.\nTolitics* seems to be a bad word at IC \u2014 ref. letter to the Editor in the last issue in' Felix' signed by the VIP's of the C&G Union \u2014 while racial is m is apparently not quite so\nlow. Mr J.G. P'le ming states that\nAshok Guru swamy' s letter 'stank of\nintolerance'\u2014strange from someone\nsupporting Rhodesia. While you replied to Ashok Guru swamy' s letter\nby saying the 'support Rhodesia\" ad vert was, in fact, an advert, and as\nsuch did not represent the views of\nFELIX \u2014 can I dare deduce from this\nthat the advert did not reflect the views of IC students, ' FELIX' being the voice of the IC Union \u2014 now you make the somewhat sweeping state-ment that it did, in fact, 'represent\nthe feelings of a significant number of people in the College'. If this is\nso, why was this not said in reply\nto Ashok Guru swamy' s letter ? Anyhow, what statistical research did lead you to this conclusion ? Ido, however, support vo u full v in the\nview that ' FELIX' should be a' forum for political debate', but why the qualification : \"... provided it re mains independent and unbiased'?\nSurely, one of the functions of any journal is to present a point of view. Apropos ' FELIX Late News'.' Aftermath of Operation Match', the\nreference to your flat-chested\nne ff res s' was in extreme lv bad taste\n( ' FELIX' unbiassed?) and I hope that\nthere are many other letters den lo ring it. As for ' Operation Match', on ringing up my' ideal date* I was informed that I was her'71 st ideal\ndate!\" 19-35 seems to be the average\nnumber! Quote from blurb in Operation Match introduction : ' We would rather give you four good matches than compromise in quality l'.R a kesh Mohan The Expert\nSir,\nIn answer to J.T. Grey's letter in your last issue I must point out that\nthis painting was selected by no less\na person than the Dean of the Royal College of Art as being the best one on show, and he is presumably better qualified than Mr. Grey to judge.\nI regard the theme as ap erectly valid one to inspire a painting if the\nartist feels strongly about it. But of\ncourse, if Mr. Grey demands un emotional thinking we might as well throw creativity out of the window and concentrate on being machine minded morons with no intellect,\npseudo or otherwise.\nC.E.

The vice-jaws, which gripped the\nbody, were cut with an oxy-acetylene torch; the ring which circled\nthe barrel had been broken in an attempt on the previous Monday\nby drilling and chiselling and was removed using toe torch.\nIt appears that one of the thieves stayed in the Union after it was\nclosed on Wednesday night by Acting Duty Officer Tony Duke.\nThe Union doors facing into Beit Quad were chained to repel de-fenders. The other assailants entered through the back entrance\nwhich was opened by unscrewing the lock. It is estimated that the\noperation would take some forty minutes to complete.\nThe mascot was supposed to be\nprotected by ingenious alarm system\nso that any tampering would set oil t ne siren. However, on the night of\ntii e raid none of these systems was\nconnected, the Wooden Horse Organisation, who are responsible for\nmascot ry, wer t relying on the protection ot the plinth and the presence of\nthe Security guards. According to the\n\" rules' of mascot stealing the mascot\nmay only be removed during U nio in hours, which would prevent the use\nof torches and the other equipment.\nAlso it is again est the rules to da mage the mascot \u2014 it is likely that\nthe cutting torch would easily melt\nthe brass body.\nWhen the siren was tested on Friday( to see if it really did work)\nit was found to be quite weak, certainly not loud enough to wake any\nof the residents of Beit Hall, except\nperhaps someone on fifth floor Old Beit.\nAt the time of writing( Sunday) nothing had been heard from the\nthieves, although it is customary to\nin form the victims within24 hours.\nHowever. Deputy President David McBain had discovered that MIKE was in the custody of University College. In order to enlist their support in recovering MIKE, the mascot of the\nCollege of Estate Management, a concrete owl, was stolen during Friday lunchtime. The owl was\nfound in their Union bar during preparations for a dance and it was an easy matter to effect its removal.\nOther IC students are making attempts to recruit mascots so that more\nhelp can be bought.\nTwo very embarrassed people are\nTo nv Duke, who had placed bets\nwith other Presidents that MIKE would not be stolen, and Ralph Corn forth, President of the W.H.O., who is being blamed for the loss\nof the mascot. On Wednesday evening Corn forth wrote a report on the\nattempt made on Mon dav. He concluded,\" MIKE WILL NEVER BE STOLEN FROM ITS PLINTH\".

What were not characteristic of a Guild's meeting were the excesses of the meeting which\nwas never fully under control. In their exuberance and recklessness,\nmany members, encouraged by the Union officers, exceeded the\nlimits of safety and decency : to set fire to a paper dart and then\n\u2022h tow it into the audience cannot be excused on any grounds,\nespecially in the finest lecture theatre in the College.\nC.E. Ms owl\nThe noise level subsided only dur-ing the presentation of rowing colours, after which President Pete\nRoberts adjourned the meeting and convened an Extraordinary General Meeting to pass some constitutional\nchanges. Without further explanation\nhe then declared that whatever he\nwished to pass was passed. Mono syllabic objections were raised to\nthis un justifiably high handed at t it ude, these were completely ignored.\nSwimming Gala Having thus abandoned the constitution, the meeting passed on to hig her matters as Phil Marshall leapt on to the stage in a neck to knee bath ing suit and cardboard banana horns,\nwhile his accomplice, Rog White, in similar dress, bounded from black board to black-board scribbling sexual graffiti. \"You may wonder why we are wearing this spastic gear'\nsaid Marsh a all, and offer red the forth-coming swimming gala as an excuse.\nDefending himself from a hail of\npaper, chalk and a probing lecture\npointer, by waving his helmet, the\nGuild's Vice President spent a boisterous ten minutes alternatively\ndescribing future Guild's activities,\nand shouting for order.

    "content": "FELIX 3\nSelwyn Lloyd\nfine form\nin IC in colour\nNationalisation\nSelwyn Lloyd recently visited a lunchtime meeting of ConS oc to give\na general talk on the present political scene. He opened his talk on the\nsubject ot Vietnam, stating that this issue is the most important in foreign\naffairs. He thought that the eon t liet could only be settled around a con ference table with the Americans and the Chinese negotiating a joint withdrawal to leave Vietnam as a flabby, central pad between these rivals.\nHe also tel t, though; that the Americans should keep up their offensive,\nincluding bombing raids, until negotiations start, as the Communists are\nno respect or s ot weakness'. He did not otter a method of achieving\nnegotiations other than giving the Chinese a full seat in the UN security\ncouncil. Continuing with foreign affairs,\nhe thought that a settlement of the Rhodesian situation would come more easily from negotiations than\nfrom sanctions which would affect\nthe Zambia n and British economies\nand would solidify the white Rhodesians behind the Smith government. He felt that the coloured citizen of Rhodesia should not be given an immediate vote but Britain should send a 'large sum' to Rhodesia to be spent on a massive\neducational drive to fit the coloured citizen for a vote.\nConcerning the role of Britain in the defence of the free world, he said that we have taken too much on ourselves and we should hand over many of our responsibilities to\nother nations. He did not, however, say how we were to get rid of these\ncommitments.\nTurning to domestic issues, he spoke of his surprise that we did not have a much worse balance of\npayments crisis in view of the way industry has bee run since the war. As for the present balance of payments crisis, he gave no real solution\nbut he warned against devaluation\nof the pound. Continuing, he criticised the present government for increasing th<\npower of t lie state in five sectors of\nthe economy. He slated the nationalisation plans for steel and the setting up of the new national authorities for freight, land etc; he dis-approved of the abandoning of his\nown National Economic Develop ment Council, the introduction of\nnew confusing' company taxes and the result in Service\ng increase in the Civil Trade Unions\nDiwali - Asian\nDuring question time, he said\nthat he would like to see a revision\nof trade union law to set up a restrictive practices court for the\nunions and to increase the power of\nthe fair minded union leaders.\nThe meeting had to be wound up through lack of time at 4.30 and the\nenthusiastic applause reflected the excellence of the speech and the precise nature of Mr Lloyd's retorts to\nthe questioning.\nDave Or mist on Festivities\nOn December2 nd the India Society celebrated Diwali \u2014 the autumn harvest festival of fireworks,\nilluminations, and music. Fire regulations rule out fireworks in the Union, so the celebration had to be limited to food, dancing, music, and magic.\nSouthSide\nStomps\nFood\nThe dinner consisted of favourite\nSouth Kensington dishes like tando ori chicken, pila o, and shi kka bab, supp lied by an outside restaurant, and was attended by over 140 people,\nincluding several members of staff\nand the De nut y High Com misi one r for India. There were, perhaps sur-pri singly, no after-dinner speeches,\nand the guests adjourned rapidly to the Concert Hall for die variety prog ram me. Entertainment\nThis was easily the best that the\nIndia Society has ever starred, and different from anything else ever\nseen at IC. Folk dances from Malabar and Rajasthan were danced with profes^sional excellence in really gorgeous\ncostumes; and the evening was greatly enlivened by Me ch.Eng. P.i,,. K. Patankar's displays of magic aud nii me. the show, naturally, over-ran; and as t ne audience waded out through the debris ot the Swimming Gala they could reflect on a unique\nevening well-spent.\nP.M. R.After Uiis term's Cellar sessions, in which Dick Morissey 4tet, the Graham Collier7 tet, and the Don Rendell4 t ct have been guests, the Jazz Club are presenting another\nanother season of SS stomps.\nTo set the stomps oft with a bang, the first one (on Wed.18 Jan.) will feature Spencer's Washboard Kings and promises to be a good evening\nfor those who care to dance, listen,\nor simply drink at the bar. Future stomps will follow at two weekly intervals. Bookings for these\nwill include Max.

At various times on Saturday 3\nDecember,19 members of the Hover\nGrew arrived at the summit ot Snowdon in their respective groups, glad to gain respite from the driving snow\nwhipped up by the strong winds.\nThe snow was about six inches deep\nand this obscured footpaths making climbing interesting. Thanks to the\norganisation of Mike Garrett we were prepared for the worst weather\ncondition ( li lbs of dates pur\nman)* and thus enjoyed the climb. B.F.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nAn Open Letter to Congregation of Oxford University and\nCambridge University Senate...\nSirs,\nIn the national interest I must urgently ask you to abandon this\nyear's Boat Race and all the others\nto come. There's no need to put John Snagge or the rosette-sellers out\nof business. All I want you to do is\notter tbe racc i to Liverpool and Man chester Universities on the Mersey, Exe' er and Bristol on the Severn or\nto York and Lan r^ster on some\nstream on the Yorkshire moors (it\njust means using smaller boats).\nMy own choice is a race between Edinburgh and St. Andrew's on\nthe Firth of Forth because there are\nstrong offshore currents and the nation likes its boats to sink at least\nonce in a generation. I see no valid reason why these two universities \u2014\nor the others I list \u2014 should have to\ncontinue to depend solely on their\nfine academic records for their image in the world. You know, gentlemen, the import ance of having animage today. But Oxford and Cambridge have more than an image. They have a legend,\na myth which often has nothing to do with the facts. And I think its\ngetting out of control.\nBRIDGE The Oxbridge Myth\nby Joshua O 'Keefe\nTake this term. One Saturday\nmorning the BBC' s2a.m. news bulletin took it for granted that light housekeepers, night shift workers and anyone else still awake would need to know that : ' The Oxford Union still has a man as president'. The following Wednesday they were told that the election had been annulled and the first-ever girl candidate,\nJanet Morgan had a second chance.\nOn Thursday, when the suspense on shop floors was assumed to be near\nbreaking point, came the news that\nshe would not stand again.\nNow gentlemen, you and I know that a woman president wouldn't make a scrap of real difference to the\nOxford Union's mainly modern teen-a gers. The Oxford Student Council quietly elected a splendid girl chairman two years ago. Nevertheless,\nMiss Morgan was given the dramatic image of a girl storming a kind of\ntalkative monastery. Or take the\nUnion mini-skirt debate which a national newspaper columnist found unworthy of this shrine of great talk where great minds have forged ringing phrases and unleashed waves of\nwit on the issues of the day...'\nEm baras sing, isn't it ? You and I know that when the Union wants\nringing phrases it invites Quintin Hog g and when it wants wit it asks\nMichael Beloft. We also know that only a handful of people in any Oxford generation are great any things. The rest are learning to be\nbrilliant, clever, competent, (crooked\nor arrant nincompoops at life. The stirring of a great talent, in the\nUnion or at a tutorial is still a rare\nand thrilling event.\nBut what counts is that people believe the myth. For implanting this\nbelief I think we can thank the Boat Race. I heard my first one at the\nage of five and it was many years\nbefore I realised that Britain had any other universities. By the time I did,I was too mes mori sed to care\nabout the m.I had graduated to the\nother Oxbridge myths \u2014 Jo wet t's Oxford, Rupert Brooke's Cambridge, ChristChurch Meadow. My brother\nworried me by coming out of\nLeicester University with a better-trained mind than anyone I knew at\nCambridge but perhaps that was just\na personal accident.\nWhat I suggest is that Oxbridge is now so bulging with myths that\nshe might start believing them herself.\nShe should get rid of at least one fabled institution. The gift of the Boat Race, one of the great primeval clashes of British life, would give an\nenormous leg-up to any other two universities.\nAnd the Government would be so\ngrateful to you that it might at last\nstop muttering about setting up Royal Com mis ions to find out what you get up to behind all those myths.\nUNNATURAL NOT RUMPS The University of Lon:! on Bride e Club runs a teams of four competition which takes place between teams\nfrom the various colleges throughout\nthe year. This competition is divided into four divisions with about eight\nteams in each division. Each team\nplays all the others in its own div is ion. At the end of the season the\ntop two teams in each division are\npromoted, and the bottom two demoted. This year IC have entered\nthree teams, one in each of the top three divisions. The first team after\ntheir initial draw have had two wins, and as yet, both the other teams also\nremain unbeaten.\nThe last match the first team played was against Queen Mary College. The following hand is one on which1 C made one of its gains in that match. Dealer West EW Vulnerable* A,10,5.Q, J,10,8,7.5.0J,8. \u2022 A,4.1*K.6.9.4.<>A, K Q976349,3. \u2022<?. J,9. S>A,K,3,04. \u2022 K. Q,7. \u2022 8, 7, 2.\n0 10, 5, 2.\n* J.10,8,6,5,2. When QM C were sitting East West the bidding was\nW NES1 HIS3 D \u2014\nH \u2014 4 D \u2014\n5 D \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nThis is a somewhat labour ed bidding sequence, and one which cert-a in ly lacks imagination. The Contract of 5 D was defeated\nwhen South lead a club, since de-clare r then had to lose two heart\ntricks and one club trick. Any other\nlead gives a chance of establishing\nthe heart suit and making the con tr act.\nAt the other table the bidding was\nof a much more concise nature.\nW NES1 HIS3 NT \u2014\nEast has a difficult decision to\nmake after North' s overall of IS. His hand then appears to have only five losers, and obviously, since his\npartner has opened the bidding, East wants to be in at least a game contract. The direct bid of 3 NT ensures that a safe game contract is\nreached. South is almost certain to\nlead a spade since North has bid the\nsuit, this will then make eight tricks\nin East'shand. West is unlikely to\nbid over ,3 NT unless he has a very strong hand, which means that East West may well have missed a slam.\nIf East had been dealer then the\nopening bid would have been 3 NT. This is an A col bid which shows along solid minor suit and one outside entry. 3 NT is often a very good contract, and if partner has nothing, avid 3 NT is doubled, you can always\ntake the contract out into 4 C or 4 D.
