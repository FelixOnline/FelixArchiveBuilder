    "content": "Features FELIX DEBATE\nBETHLEHEM UNIVERSITY\nTomorrow's Extraordinary Union\nGeneral Meeting\nwas called after the\nFriends of Palestine\nSociety managed to\ngain enough\nsignatures to call for\na second reading of\ntheir Bethlehem\nUniversity motion.\nAt the last UGM,\nthis proved to be a contentious issue so\nFELIX has devoted\nsome space to the\nmotion and the\nopposing views\nfrom Friends of\nPalestine and the\nJewish Society.\nFirstly S Alami\nfrom Friends of\nPalestine puts the\ncase for their\nmotion.\nOn October 26 1987, Palestinian\nstudents at Bethlehem University\nwere gathered to commemorate the\nKafr Kassem massacre. Israeli army\nunits surrounded the area and charged\ninto the demonstrators with tear gas\nand live ammunition. Is'haq Abu Srur\nwas then fatally shot in the head by\nan Israeli army sniper using a0.22 inch Baretto rifle. The students had\nno intention of confrontation. Nothing\nhappened until the Israeli soldiers\nattacked, only then did the students\nrespond with stones.\nThe real concern arises from the\nfact that the shooting is not an isolated\nincident. Since December 1986, 15\nPalestinian youths, including 4\nuniversity students, have been shot\ndead and a further 106 wounded, the\nmajority in the chest or head. The\nextensive firing, the violent beatings\nand the harassment of young\nprotestors has reached an intolerable\nlevel. The use of sniper rifles marks\na new and sinister phase in the already\nobvious shoot-to-kill policy.\nThe Israeli daily Ha 'are tz reported\nan Israeli official saying that 'the gun\nwould be used to shoot at selected\ntargets such as the leaders of\ndemonstrations and those who hoist\nPalestinian flags'. So hoisting the flag\nis now a crime not punishable by 1\nor 2 years in prison but by a summary\nexecution.\nIn the words of Joel Greenberg of\nthe Jeruselem Post, 'the new rifle has\nbecome recognised and legitimate,\nenabling soldiers to pick off protest\nleaders with methodical precision and\ndeadly accuracy. Thus the\ncommanding officer is given the\noption of arbitrarily selecting\nindividuals for summary execution.'\nOr, in the words of Israel Shahak of\nthe Israeli League for Human and\nCivil Rights in Jerusalem, 'the new\nweapon is a method of assassination\nof those Palestinians who appear to\nbe leaders of a demonstration'.\nOn the second day of the shooting,\nBethlehem University was ordered\nclosed by the Israeli occupation\nauthorities for 3 months. This not\nonly constitutes severe disruption of\nacademic life and education but is a collective punishment forbidden by\ninternational law.\nThis closure clearly contravenes the\nGeneva IV Convention (Annex, Part\nI, article 3; Part II, articles 27, 32 and\n33; Part III, articles 47, 64 and 68\nplus the corresponding parts in the\nICU\nAttacks on Bethlehem University\n. That on Wednesday, October 25th1987. Israeli soldiers attacked students\nat Bethlehem University in the Occupied West Bank, who were\ncommemorating the anniversary of the Lafr Kassem massacre, in which\n49 Israeli Arabs were shot dead by Israeli forces.\n. That during the attack live ammunition was used, and amongst the injured\nwas Issa Abu-Srur who was shot in the head.\nThat two days after the shooting Issa died in hospital from his gun shot\nwound.\nThat during his stay in hospital until his death Issa's family were prohibited\nfrom visiting him by military order.\n5. That following the attack on Palestinian students Bethlehem University\nhas been ordered closed for a period of three months commencing 29.10.87.\nICU believes;\n1, That Palestinian students have a right of access to education, academic\nfreedom and freedom of expression and that Israeli attack- and closures\nof Palestinian universities are a serious obstacle to peace in the Middle\nEast as such actions constitute a serious violation to any people's basic\nhuman rights.\nICU instruct the Executive:\n1. To write letters of support and condolence to Issa's family and to the Student\nCouncil at Bethlehem University.\n2. To write a letter of protest to the Israeli Embassy and to ask for the\nimmediate reopening of the University.\n3. To participate immediately in a high-profile campaign against shootings\nof Palestinian students and against the military-ordered closure of the\nUniversity through;\ni) A national press conference on the closure of Bethlehem University with\nan invited speaker from the University itself.\nii) A national petition.\"promoted in the mailings publication COM at IC\naddressed to the Israeli government calling for the immediate reopening\nof the University and for the cessation of violent attacks on Palestinian\nstudents (especially the use of ammunition).\nin; An information pack on Academic freedom under Occupation to be\ndistributed to students.\niv) A letter-writing campaign to British MPs asking them to put pressure\non the Israeli government so that it reopens the University and allows it\nto function free of military attacks.\nHague Convention) thus violating the\nright of access to education and of\nacademic freedom.\nIt is important to establish the\nfollowing:\n1. The Israeli soldiers did attack\nfirst and the killing of Is'haq Abu Srur\nby a sniper bullet was willful.\n2. Not a single report from any\nsource claims that live ammunition\nwas used by the Palestinian students.\n3. The closure of Bethlehem\nUniversity is illegal.\n4. Access to education, academic\nfreedom, freedom of thought and\nexpression are universal rights and\nshould apply to Palestinian students.\n5. The freedoms 'granted' in the\nam mend ment s are regularly violated\nby the Israeli military.\nThus any am mend ment which\nviolates one of the above rights is\nunacceptable.\nFinally it must be stressed that\nPalestinian students throughout the\noccupied territories in the West Bank\nand Gaza Strip are continually\nsubjected to a number of restrictive\nharassment s and a denial of basic\nrights. This motion specifically\naddresses the serious recent incident\nat Bethlehem University. It is neither\na criticism of Israeli policies nor a discussion of the solution to the\nPalestinian/Israeli conflict.\nS Alami (Chem Eng PG).\n22 Wednesday 16th December 1987 FELIX "

'You're not putting any effort\ninto the part; you must develop the character so that you're\nbelievable.'\n'But how, what sort of character does a pumpkin have?' bleated\nArthur Michael faintly. Ht^knew any form of protest was hopeless.\n\\ They had all been at the rehearsal for\nmore than eight hours, and Mad Dash\nwas so strict about everything that\nthey were still working on the first\nAct.\nEveryone was practising for the\nCheapskate pantomime, Cinderella.\nThis was another one of Mad Dash's pet projects, so nobody had a chance\nof getting out of taking part. As soon\nas they got the dreaded phone call,\nthey knew they had to do what Mad\nDash wanted. Unfortunately the cast\nwere not very happy with the parts\nthey had been given. Derek Dash, the\nBaron, was playing the lead role, Cinderella, and was having a particularly tough time of things. The worst thing for Derek was that\nhe had to dance with John Secretary, who was playing Prince\nCharming, and the slipper fitting scene was certainly putting a strain\non their professional relationship. John Secretary thought that his\ntights showed off his legs particularly well\nwhereas The Baron had to cope with a huge|\ndress and two oranges and looked even sillier\nthan usual.\nArthur Michael was particularly upset not\nto have been given the part of the Fairy\nGodmother, which had gone to Mrs Jolly\nHockey Sticks: Mad Dash had decided that\nhe was best suited to an inanimate role.\n(John Secretary had realised this years ago,\nbut had decided to hang on to Arthur Michael\njust for the entertainment value.) As usual,\nhowever, Arthur Michael was insisting on\ntaking everything far too seriously. He was\ntrying to persuade Mad Dash that it was old fashioned to have a coach\nand horses as the transport. He wanted to bring the production up\nto date and have Cinderella travelling to the Ball in a boat: he even\nknew a man in Oxford who would do a very reasonable deal. But Mad\nDash had insisted that they stick to the original script, and had\nexplained to Arthur Michael that he had to make the transformation\ninto a coach and horses as visual as possible. The best Arthur Michael\nhad come up with had been to shout loudly; 'I 've just turned into a coach and horses'. Mad Dash concluded that she had a lot of work\nto do with her actors.\n'You're not using your imagination', said Mad Dash, losing her\npatience with Arthur Michael. 'Just remember, for the first half of\nthe scene you have to look like a vegetable. Now what do you think\nis the best way of going about this?'\nArthur Michael looked confused. 'You've got to think like a vegetable, stupid', screamed Mad Dash.\n'That shouldn't be too difficult', said John Secretary under his\nbreath.\nWhile Mad Dash was giving Arthur Michael a hard time, Derek\ndecided to slip away to a quiet corner and write a letter to Father\nChristmas. He always seemed to get exactly what he wanted when\nhe wrote to Father Christmas, and was beginning to suspect that there\nmust be something going on between Father Christmas and Mad Dash.\nThis year he had decided to stretch his luck a bit and ask for the things\nhe really wanted. 'This will test the old man', he thought as he began.\nGr^ s tte;^^^ Chii. bore. Ior. UK^3\u00abdX w en&WUj\n10 Wednesday 16th December 1987 FELIX\n\n"

I did not see any\nreason last week for cutting out a small ad which read: *Fridges\nwanted. Contact Bernard Sunley. But\nthe acting sub warden of Holbein did.\nHe came into the FELIX Office last\nMonday wanting to know who had\nnut the ad in. It is my policy that only\nsma ii ads which have a name and\ndepartment on the back are published\nbut it is also my policy that I will not\nlet any third party know the names.\nI told him that I would get in touch\nwith the person who placed the ad and\nask them to get in touch with him\ninstead. This I did. But Mr Subwarden was not satisfied with this\nand went bleating to the Union\nPresident that there should be a censorship committee to censor small\nads. What tripe! If you were on a censoring committee and you read\n\u2022 Fridges wanted: Contact Bernard\nSunley, would you throw it out? Of course not!

    "content": "Features SPECIAL\nEarlier this year a General Meeting of\nthe University of\nExeter Guild of\nStudents\nunanimously passed\na motion\ncondemning the fur\ntrade and created a 'fur free zone' in\ntheir Union\nBuilding. Lynx, the\nonly national\norganisation\ncampaigning solely\nto end the fur trade\nin this country,\nhailed this as a marvelous example\nto all other students\naround Britain. So\nwill you be wearing\nfurs this Christmas?\nFur or\nagainst?\nFur is very much a seasonal trade\nwith vast quantities of coats being sold\nbetween November and February\neach year. Fur pelts, whether wild or\nfarmed, become thick and glossy in\nthe late autumn and throughout\nwinter. It is during November that\nfarmed minks are killed and pelted.\nAuction sales are held regularly from\nmid-December through to June. Pelts\nare auctioned in a 'raw' state: this is\nwhere animals have usually been\nelectrocuted and then skinned but the\npelts have not been cleaned. The\nseason's first pelts are sent for\ncleaning, dressing and dyeing from\nMarch onwards. Fur pelts are\nprepared in many ways. They are\ns capped and thinned. Raw leather is\nbrittle and hard so the skins have to\nbe drummed to soften the leather and\nthen cleaned. Dressing is a lengthy\nprocess and can take over a month to\ncomplete. The major international fur\nfairs, such as Frankfurt, Madrid and\nParis take place in March and April.\nIt is orders placed at these fairs which\nare made up during the the summer\nand which reach the shops in time for\nthe next winter.\nWhy do people wear fur coats?\nWith so many synthetic fibres which\nare just as warm, just as waterproof\nor just as comfortable, why do so\nmany people throughout the world\nprefer wearing fur? The British Fur\nTrade Association believe that it is\nbecause people like the feel of fur and\nthe feeling of well-being it gives\nthem. They claim that many women\nwho do not own a fur coat say that\na fur coat would feature high on their\nlist of things that they would like to\nown. Meanwhile Lynx are doing their\nbest to get rid of fur's glamourous\nimage. The most famous campaign\nthey have run in past years has been\n'It takes up to 40 dumb animals to\nmake a fur coat...But only one to\nwear it'. The impact of such\ncampaigns has been that the lower\nrange of the market, the rabbit skins\nand lamb paw jackets, have not been\nselling. I spoke to a furrier who said\nthat the mink and luxury furs market\nwas still strong but the cheap furs\nwhich most young secretaries would\npreviously have bought and worn are\nvery hard to get rid of nowadays. It\nseems that the campaign has only had\nan effect on the young women where\nfur is no longer fashionable in their\ncircles. Most fur is sold to middle-aged women who still believe fur to\nbe glamourous as well as warm and\ncomfortable.\nWhy don't people wear fur coats?\nThe anti-fur lobby is growing rapidly\nthroughout Britain and a host of\ncelebrities are joining the band\nwagon. In 1986 the first ever National\nAnti-Fur Rally was held in Trafalgar\nSquare where thousands of Lynx\nsupporters gathered to hear speakers\nfrom both the European and British\nParliaments. That same year a petition\ncalling for a ban on all world fur\nimports from countries still using the\nleg hold trap was presented to No 10\nDowing Street by Clare Francis. It\ncontained nearly 200,000 signatures.\nMost Lynx supporters do so\nbecause they want to see inhumane\ntrapping banned. In an independent\nopinion poll last year 74% of 2000\nsamples were against trapping and\n70% against fur farming. They won't wear fur because they are opposed to\nimprisoning animals for a life time\nand slaughtering them at a fraction of\ntheir natural lifespans, when there are\nalternatives available. 'But does the\nanti-fur lobby eat meat or spread\nground bones on their vegetables or\nfeed offal to their pets?\" The British\nFur Trade Association argues. It\npoints to the campaigners' double\nstandards; at the protesters who wear\nleather shoes and eat chicken\nsandwiches. Not even vegans seem to\nbe able to explain away the millions\nof rats, mice and rabbits that have to\nbe killed throughout the world in\norder that they can enjoy their vegan\ndiets.\nSome campaigners have become\nanimal terrorists, tired of the lack of\nresults that Lynx provide. Bands of\nprotesters have sent threats to fur\ntraders, bombed fur stores and let free\nthousands of animals from British\nmink farms. The fur trade made great\nprofit out of the fact that most of the\nfreed animals returned to the farms\nin search of the continuous food\nsupply they were used to.\n20 Wednesday 16th December 1987 FELIX\n\n"

She had decided that his modern interpretation of the third\nugly sister was a bit unusual, but he seemed determined to play the\ncharacter as someone who was permanently asleep.\nAll the cast took their places, and\nDerek began his first speech as\nCinderella: 'Oh woe is me!' he\ncried. 'Where, oh where, will I find\nsomeone to help me go to the Ball\ntonight?'\n'Behind you', called John\nSecretary, beginning to enjoy\nhimself in a big way.\nThere's nobody behind me',\nreplied the Baron, not thinking very\nquickly.\n'That's another way of putting\nit', chuckled John Secretary to\nhimself.\n'Be quiet everybody!', shouted\nMad Dash at the top of her voice.\n'Let's get on with the rehearsal!'.\nMad Dash just about managed to\nkeep John Secretary quiet and\nthe rehearsal continued.\nMeanwhile, some of the cast who\nhad nothing to do until the scene\nat the Ball were beginning to get a bit irritable. The three clowns,\nDave Braincell, Clare MacUseless and Jumping Jehosofat were\nparticularly bored. Jumping Jehosofat was playing the doorman at the\nBall: all he had to do was bow very low whenever anyone came in.\nAs far as he could see his part was completely u necessary, but Mad\nDash had been particularly keen that there should be a very prominent\nbow at the side of the stage when any of the guests entered, so that\nthe audience would notice that they had arrived.\nClare MacUseless had an even less important role: she had to rush\nforward when Derek picked up Cinderella's slipper, claiming that it\nwas hers. Not very much of a role, she thought but at least she did\nhave a few lines to say, unlike Braincell. This had been an inspired\nbit of casting by Mad Dash. Braincell was playing the clock which\nstruck midnight to signal that it was time for Cinderella to go home.\nAll he had to do was shout 'dong l' twelve times.\nMeanwhile, there was a bit of disturbance in the Phallix Office. On\nthe stroke of midnight one of the Phallix minions had thrown a typewriter across the room, shouting: 'That's enough! I'm not writing\nany more of this bloody 'Duke of Sluicegate' column! I'm going out\nto get pissed. Merry Christmas!\nDerek re-read his letter. It was one of his best letters ever, he thou gt. He put it in an envelope and wrote 'Father Christmas' on it. Derek\nwas never sure what postbox was the right one for letters to Father\nChristmas, so he always gave his\nletters to Mad Dash to post:\napparently she knew exactly where to\nsend the letter, or so she said.\nNo sooner had he sealed the\nenvelope than Derek heard Mad Dash\ncalling out for him in her usual raucous\nvoice. He hurried over to the stage,\nnot wanting to put his wife in a bad\nmood before giving her his letter for\nFather Christmas. Mad Dash was\npreparing to run through the whole\npantomime from start to finish, which\nmeant that Derek had to be on stage\nto do the opening scene with the three\nugly sisters, played by Whygate, Ego\nand Takeiteasy.

Didn't do too\nwell in first half of course, decided\nto take time off and worked in snack\nbar. Managed Norman's during the\nSummer. Now works full time in\nUnion Bar.\nJez Sone: keyboardist, plays rhythm\nand sometimes lead guitar, Bio graduate, concentrates on music.\nJason Grey: Shouts at everyone in\npractice and tells them to shut up; lead\nvocals, rhythm guitar some lead,\nwrites some of the music and some\nof the lyrics. Ex-Aero student.\nHow long has the band been\ntogether?\nPete: A year, one month and twenty\nsomething days.\nWhen you were in the process of\nforming a band, were there any\nconflicts in deciding what sort'of\nmusical style you would adopt?\nJason: We were very pushed for time\nat the beginning because we had a couple of jams and then Kev Buckley\n(ex Union Bar Manager) suggested\nthat we play a gig within ten days. We\nhad to get something together very\nfast. Now it was basically my say. I got a few ideas just by listening to\ncover versions, and I had one or two\nsongs from other bands and my own\nsongs I wanted to try. We distributed\na lot of tapes around; listen to this,\nlearn how to play it and come to the\nrehearsal. We had three practices and\njust did the gig fairly blind really.\nWhen your drummer Andy decided\nto leave the band, how did you go\nabout finding a new drummer?\nJason: When we were working at the\nfresher s event this year I was talking\nto the guitarist from TV World. He\nsuggested that we try this 'New Line'\nagency; they put bands in touch with\nmusicians and musicians in touch with\nbands. They sent us a letter; we filled\nin the forms and they keep supplying\nus with names of drummers. The\nrabbits they supplied have been\nparticularly helpful and when we get\npissed off with them we can eat them.\nThat's always assuming they haven't gnawed through too many alarm\ncables first.\nThe band went through a stage of\ncalling itself the Baby Deltas. Why\ndid you decide to change your\nname?\nJez: We knew of another band in this\ncountry called Stagefright and there\nwas this sort of common knowledge\nthat if you call yourself a name that\nanother band has they can sue you.\nNas: There was another factor; the\ndrummer thought the name sucked.\nHow did you come up with the\nname Baby Deltas?\nPete: We were sitting in the Union\nBar haggling. Jason said what about\ndelta, you know, the logo delta. Nas\nsuggested that graphically he liked\nlittle delta better. Andy said Baby\nDelta. So we were the Baby Delta's. When we got rid of Andy we got rid\nof the name as well.\nHow did your parents and tutors\nreact when you told them you\nwanted to form a band?\nPete: My mother said 'Oh I'd better\npractice sewing on sequins then'. My mum was quite happy about it.\nJez: They weren't particularly\nconcerned, I don't think. I suspect\nthey would probably rather I had\napplied for a job last year, because\nparents like to see their offspring\nworking.\nNas: My Dad just rang me from Hong\nKong. I had to meet a plane and I thought, right, it's as good a time as\never. I told him that I hadn't applied\nfor any jobs and that I was going to\nfollow Mr Grey around and play in\nthis band. He said 'Fine, it's your life,\njust make sure you meet that plane.'\nJason: Well, the Head of Department,\nthe only interest he ever shows in the\npeople on his course is when you\nreach the final year and he gives you\nthis fifteen m inuit e interview, to make\nhim look concerned. When he started\nasking me about my career\u2014when I told him that I did n't want to go into\nany engineering of any sort or apply\nfor any jobs because I had set this\nband up in College and was really\nenjoying it, the look of horror on his\nface and the other member of staff\nthat was in the room was quite\nsomething to behold. It was quite\nfrightening; he almost had apoplexy.\nYou played an acoustic rep e to ire in\nthe Holland Club recently and it\nwas received very well. Do you see\nStagefright in du ld g ing in more\nacoustic songs in the future?\nJason: I certainly found at the Holland\nClub, that as a singer, I felt very\nnaked. You haven't got, dare I say it,\nthe rest of the band to hide behind.\nWhen there is a familiar sound\npumping out all around me I have the\nconfidence to switch off to everything\nelse and just concentrate on singing.\nBut when I found in the Holland Club,\nyou could here people chinking\nglasses and pulling pints and you're\nsinging and the volumes are much\nmore quiet, you can hear things\u2014I was feeling a lot more vulnerable.\nHave you any more gigs lined up in\nCollege?\nPete: Yes, the big one on January\n29th, which is Ian Howgate's birthday\nparty. We're playing in the Concert\nHall, fairly late on in the evening.\nThat should be a really good gig.\nWhat do you think the prospects of\ngetting a recording contract are?\nPete: It's a case of being in the right\nplace at the right time. It's obviously\nwhere we'd like to go. As you play\naround, London, for instance, you're\nname gets bandied around. If you've\ngot your posters up, someone's going\nto see them. Hopefully one of these\ndays we will get an AR( Artist and\nRepetoire) man to come and listen to\nyou and if he doesn't, he will mention\nyou to somebody else and the interest\nsort of snowballs. It's just a matter\nof chance really.\nWho tends to write the songs for the\nband?\nPete: Jason does.\nJason: I'd say that would have been\ntrue, but as time progresses I think\nmore and more people are becoming\ninvolved. Early on, towards the end\nof my second year, I'd written a couple of songs. Nas became involved\nin a couple of songs. Jez is now\nbecoming involved. Whereas Nas\nwrites in a style, I write in a style,\nJez is a lot more analytical as far as\nmusic is concerned. Because of that\nhe can input varying styles into a song.\nDo you have any particular\ntechniques of writing songs?\nJason: A tune is very important first.\nI can't write lyrics and fit a song to\nit. I 've never been able to work like\nthat.\nNas: It starts from the feeling. A feeling that came about a week ago\nand then suddenly you see yourself\nplaying this tune and then you put the\ntune together and try and write some\nwords.\nJason: It all stems from something\nreal that has happened. We don't generally try to make it up. So there\nis always some sort of idea behind the\nsong.\nJez: I think Nas and Jason believe that\nthe tune is the most important thing\nfor a song whereas I'm differ e.:T think equally important is rhythm ind\ntexture. I could happily write a song\nin one cord if I thought it was vaguely\noriginal.\nAre you aiming for any particular\naudience?\nPete: People like us. People who\nwould go out and see a rock group\nlike Whitesnake or Black Sabbath,\nhave a good time, enjoy themselves,\ndrink a lot and get down and\nhead bang. What do you think of the music\nthat's currently in the charts?\nJason: It shows that the market can\nreally be led. You know, if you see\na jeans advert of a guy stripping off\nin a launder et te you go out and buy\nthe record and the record company\ncashes in. They're quite mercenary;\nthey're not worried.\nDo you think you could handle\nbeing ripped to pieces in the press?\nPete: As Oscar Wilde once said,\n\"there is only one thing worse than\nbeing talked about and that is not\nbeing talked about.\" If someone says\nthis band is crap, then at least this\nband is being mentioned.\nFELIX Wednesday 16th December 1987 17\n\n"

    "content": "Academic Freedom Vs Licence to riot\nNeville Nelkon, Chairman of the ICU Jewish Society, explains\nwhy Bethlehem University was closed and describes the clashes\nwhich led up to the shooting of Is'haq Abu Srur.\nBefore 1967 under Jordanian rule,\nthere was not a single university in\nJudea-Samaria (recently coined the\nWest Bank). All the universities\noperating today\u2014there are now\n5\u2014were developed and accredited as\nfully-fledged universities by Israel.\nThey include over 6000 students and\nseveral hundred lecturers. These\nuniversities are the most free in the\nMiddle East with the exception of\nthose in Israel itself. As independent\ninstitutions they enjoy:\n1. Freedom to set syllabuses and\ncourse content.\n2. Freedom to employ Arab and\nforeign academic staff.\n3. Freedom to exist as independent\neducational institutions.\n4. Freedom to examine and criticise\ngovernment policies within normal\nacademic research standards.\n5. Freedom to purchase all books\nexcept the 350 included on the\ncensor's list.\n6. Freedom to obtain funding from\nany source excluding the PLO, but\nincluding hostile Arab states.\n7. Freedom to set entrance\nstandards and control entry to the\ninstitution.\n8. Students enjoy the freedom to\ncriticise government policies\npeacefully.\nYet this is clearly insufficient for\na significant proportion of the students\nas the universities have become the\nvanguard for incitement, extremism\nand terror. The situation is described\nby Al-Kuds, a pro-Jordanian\nnewspaper on October 19th1984: 'The roots of the recent crises are\nthe overwhelming political activities\non the campuses.. .causing the actual\nacademic activity to comprise less\nthan 1 % of the overall agenda on the\ncampuses.'\nDr Kna'ana, Acting President of\nAn-Najah, reinforces this view in the\nPLO funded Al-Fajr.\n'...the intentions of those who\nsupervised the establishment of the\neducational institutions were not\nreally to foster education.. .rather they\nviewed the establishment of these\ninstitutions as helping their own\npolitical ambitions or as advancing\ntheir commercial interests.'\nHe goes on to make the pointed\nremark:\n'This chaos.. .has not been the result\nof the absence of national\nsovereignty. Such deadly chaos has\nnot characterised every non-sovereign\nsociety, especially not its higher\neducation.'\nAt the heart of the crisis is the\nstruggle between the internal\nadministrations of the various\ninstitutions and the students on one\nhand\u2014and among PLO, leftist and\nMoslem Brotherhood elements, on\nthe other\u2014for control of the\ncampuses. At Bethlehem University\nin the wake of violent clashes between\nleftists and Fatah supporters, in which\nseven students were stabbed or\notherwise injured, the internal\nadministration closed the university\non November 23 1984 for three days.\nOn May 25 1985, in violent fights\namong students from rival factions,\n40 were wounded at Bir Zeit and\ndamage to the campus was estimated\nat thousands of dollars. The university\nadministration closed the institution\nfor a month. Statistics kept by the\nAdviser on Arab Affairs to the\nCoordinator of Activities show that\nthe universities in these areas have\nbeen closed for more days by the\nuniversity authorities themselves than\nby the Israeli authorities.\nMoreover, it is important to\nrecognise that the basis of the legal\nsystem in this area is previous\nJordanian law and that Israel operates\nunder international law. This may be\nsummarised by the American guide\nto the Laws of War on Land which\nstates:\n'...that the occupying powers may\nprevent any and all teaching which\nserves to provoke hostility toward the\noccupant's forces, disrespect to the\nlatter and their commands, or passive\nresistance to the lawful orders given\nto the civilian population.' It is against\nthis that Israel's policies must be\njudged.\nIn 1979 a first year student at Bir Zeit ran a Fatah terrorist cell which\nkilled 4 Israeli civilians. More\nrecently, the widely distributed 1986\nPLO-Fatah calendar singles out for\nspecial celebration the anniversaries\nof the PLO massacre of the Israeli\nathletes at Munich in 1972 and the\nmurder of school children in Maalot\nin 1974.\nIndeed, Israeli political policies can\nbe subject to legitimate discussion and\ncriticism. But such discussion is\nirrelevant to the question of educational functioning and the\nacademic integrity of the West Bank\ninstitutions. Academic freedom is not\nto be equated with opportunity for\npolitical incitement or underground\nactivity in the West Bank, or\nanywhere else in the world.\nSt. Mary's For the past week (Monday\nNovember 30 to Friday December 4)\nthe student life here has been\ndominated by the Musical A Funny\nThing Happened on the Way to the\nForum by Stephen Sondheim. This\nwork is best known through the long\nstanding association with Frankie\nHowerd. This choice was made in a hurry at the beginning of term but no\nshortage of time was apparent in the\nfive performances on consecutive\nnights.\nThe musical is set in Ancient\nRome, and this was quite believable\nwhen the staging was revealed at the\nstart of the first act. The set consisted\nof three houses, the centre one being\nmore imposing with a functional\nbalcony and fine pillars. A functional\nfountain added to the scene well\ncomplemented by thoughtful well\nexecuted lighting.\nThe actors were of high standard,\neach proficient in their roles. One\nreally should mention David Ketchin\n(l st year) as Pseudolous, a part he\nplayed with composure and elan.\nRichard Keen as the dirty old man\nSenex injected the correct amount of\ndepravity into a difficult part. The\nvoice of Borris Morrice, Hero, was\nsuperb. The duet with Senex and\nHero I believe was the best song of\nthe production.\nOn a visual note the choreography\nadded to the event in that the dancing\nscene when Pseudolous views the\nfemales Marcus Lycus has to offer\nproduced the desired erotic effect.\nFull marks for a nerve! The large set\nroutines were executed well as all\nconcerned clearly knew what to do,\nso difficult in amateur productions.\nThe music itself was a little lacking,\nnot up to the standard of the other\nfacets.\nIn conclusion the performance was\nextremely funny and if one had gone\nto see it in the West End the only\ndifference would be the orchestra\nquality. Indeed I have myself seen\nworse productions in theatre land. FELIX Wednesday 16th December 1987 23\n\n"

Note: between steps three and\nfour you have voted\u2014still it's a fantastic system for those who can\nuse/abuse it (Mr Baker, Mr Tyler) so\nlike any good bureaucrats they can\nmake the process last three hours.\nFashion\nWhy will Chris Martin be wearing a dress in the first week of next term?\nThis is Pub Board's industrial action\n(personally I do it for fun).

No\nlonger does FELIX contain reports of\nmassive demonstrations, well IC accommodation crisis looming'\nattended discos and outraged students.\nAlthough the 'life' has gone out of\nuniversity life, it still didn't stop\nFELIX reporting on the more interest\nevents going on around College.\nThe 'postgraduate' FELIX, produced in August, carried the\nheadline 'Finance blunder drags IC\nfurther into debt'. An investigation\nhad been carried out by the Inland\nRevenue and it was estimated that IC\nwould have to pay more than\n\u00a3100,000 in unpaid tax. The problem\nhad arisen because administration had\nfailed to pay contributions for all their\ncasual workers. Since then prices\nhave gone up in bars and refectories\naround College. The only bar that\nseems to have resisted the increases\nhad been the Union Bar which\nreduced the price of its canned soft\ndrinks by 2p to 30p. This term has undoubtedly seen a tightening of the purse strings all over\nCollege. Week after week there has\nbeen news of erosion in every\ndepartment. Even central\nadministration has had to face losses\nand as the Sherfield Print Unit is\ngradually being run down, more and\nmore College printing is being done\non the Union's Print Unit. Over\nSummer the Rector announced that\nthe College would produce its own\npaper for academic staff to be called\nNetwork. The first issue hit the streets\non October 12th. Each member of\nacademic staff was wondering why\nCollege was spending so much money\non a public relations exercise when\nthey had to lose technicians or\nsecretaries. The Rector defended\nhimself by saying that in the long term\nNetwork would raise more money\nthan was ever spent on its production.\nIt was finally decided that Prof Ash's 'desk-top publishing baby' would be\ntypeset and printed by the Union to\nreduce costs. This hasn't stopped\nmembers of the College administration calling it by its more\nundignified FELIX title, WetNerk.\nBut while the Union Print Unit was\nenjoying the prospect of having more\nwork than it could print, everything\nwent wrong.

    "content": "E LiX OPINION\nI wanna tell you a story\nNow hear and attend and listen, best\nbeloveds, while your Uncle Andy\ntells you the saddest tale ever written.\nIt is the tale of five thousand unhappy\nchildren and all their wicked Uncles\nand Aunts.\nOnce upon a time there were five\nthousand children, who went to a big,\nbig school in a place called London.\nEvery morning of the week, the\nchildren got up at about 8am feeling\nmiserable. When they had cleaned\ntheir teeth, for most of them were\ngood little children, best beloveds,\nthey would walk out of their damp\nlittle houses carrying such an awful\nlot of books and paper, and wend their\nways to the big school, still feeling\nmiserable because they really didn't like the big, big school they had to\ngo to.\nThe big school was ruled over by\nall the little childrens' Uncles and\nAunts. Some of them were quite nice,\nalthough they were all a bit old, best\nbeloveds, but some of them were so\nnasty that you will have bad dreams\nabout them, just like the little children\ndid. The ones who were really nasty\nhad forgotten how to laugh a long\ntime ago, and had spent such a long\ntime being rude to little children that\nthey couldn't remember how to be\nany other way. Most of them were all\nshrivelled and dried up, so that they\nlooked just like dried plums, and were\njust as sour.\nThe wicked Uncles and Aunts had\nto teach the little children all sorts of\ndifficult things. The little children\nwere quite willing to try their best,\nbut when they had first come to the\nbig, big school they had had such a shock meeting the Uncles and Aunts,\nwho were all divided up into nasty\nthings like Course Coordinators and\nPersonal Tutors, that they had lost all\ntheir enthusiasm, and the Uncles and\nAunts were such dry, dead people that\neven when they said something\ninteresting the children just sighed and\nfelt sad.\nBut listen carefully, best beloveds,\nfor the very worst thing was this:\nWhen some of the little children who\nhad just got to the big school went to\nsee their personal Aunts and Uncles\nto tell them how unhappy they were,\nthe wicked grown-ups wouldn't help\nat all! They only told the poor\nchildren to work harder than ever,\nwhich was just the problem in the first\nplace. It wasn't that the Aunts and\nUncles were bad in the first place, but\nthey had been locked up in the big,\nbig school for such a long time that\nthey had forgotten what the world was\nlike, and besides, because of a very\nwicked thing called Tenure, best\nbeloveds, they couldn't be got rid of\neven if they were really awful, and\nif all the children said so at once. So\nall the little children had lost heart,\nand never complained any more,\nexcept to other little children.\nMy friends, despite the Rudyard\nKipling style, I ain't kidding. Many\npeople here do find life the most\nappalling grind, and it shouldn't be\nthat way. It is mostly the result of the\ndated and unsympathetic attitudes\ndisplayed by many members of staff\nwho can't teach to save their lives,\nand who have forgotten how to be\nhuman. If you don't watch it, you\ncould end up like that.\nIt is not natural for people to be\nmiddle aged in their attitudes at the\nage of nineteen, and yet I reckon a majority of undergraduates here fall\ninto that category. And you will too,\nif you don't do something about it.\nRebel! Complain! Don't stand for\nincompetence, don't roll with the\npunches, don't let the bastards grind\nyou down. There are channels of\ncomplaint, there are ways of making\nyour voice heard. If an entire lecture\ngroup writes to the Rector\ncomplaining about a particular\nmember of staff, things might happen.\nDon't let them turn you into a machine\u2014behave like a student,\nwhich means an intelligent young\nperson who has definite ideas and\nwho gets things done. Drag this\nprehistoric institution screaming and\nkicking into the twentieth century-it CAN be done.\nAndy Bannister\nOPINION\nIn praise of...\nPraise may be out of\nfashion, and dangerously\nlikely to worsen IC's complacency about\nteaching standards, but\nstill...Here's a bit of\nencouragement for those\nwho, albeit with natural\nadvantages, are getting it\nnearly right\u2014the\nGeology department.\nIt's well into the academic year and\nonce more voices are raised in\nchorus\u2014no, it's not more Christmas\ncarols, it's that ancient sport, 'Let's slag off the lecturers'. Isn't it sad to\nsee so many people having such an\nawful time for three years of their\nlives? Boring courses, appalling\nlecturers, no social life (?); in short,\nIC has no redeeming features.\nCan I really be the only person in\nCollege enjoying my course? My opinion is that the lecturers in my\ndepartment are doing an amazing job\nunder extremely trying\ncircumstances.\nI suppose the fact that I find my\nsubject enthralling (on a good day)\ngives me a big advantage. But in my\ndepartment one does get the feeling\nthat at least one of College's boasts\nis true\u2014we are being kept up-to-date\non some of the latest research and\nideas in the subject. Where else would\nyou be told, 'Here's the latest idea on\nthis topic, but don't write it in your\nexams because it hasn't been\npublished yet'? Where else do you get\nsent off to a two-day meeting to hear\nsome of the biggest names in a specific field presenting work that's fairly obviously still being thought\nout?\nBesides all this, our lecturers\nmanage to project their enthusiasm for\ntheir subject despite such provocation\nas having a one-person audience for\nthree weeks running\u2014due, I hasten to\nadd, to the students' nocturnal\nlifestyle rather than to the quality of\nthe lecturing. It must help that classes\nare small enough for students and\nlecturers to at least recognise each\nother, unlike other departments I 've\nheard described. Formality is at a minimum, and most people seem to\nfeel that the lecturers are at least\napproachable. Admittedly, it would\ntake a very hard-hearted person not\nto thaw a bit at the sight of a bedraggled student staggering from a day out in the field. Also, with the\nauthorities keeping close tabs on who\nspends the field trip hiding in the\nvillage coffee-shop, it's difficult for\nstudents to feel the department is\nimpersonal. The nasty comments,\nwhen delivered, are all too personal.\nThis brings me to one complaint\nthat could be made\u2014that we're being\nspoon-fed. Yet by this stage we're\nalso doing large projects with only as\nmuch supervision as we need\u2014or ask\nfor. Parts of the course leave much\nto be desired. Computing as taught to\nfirst years, for example, was a standing joke; that is, if you were one\nof the lucky few who already knew\none end of the keyboard from the\nother. Some of the lecturers at times\nprovided the classic cure for\ninsomnia, though listening to people\nfrom other courses we seem to have\nescaped lightly. And we do know that\nour complaints have been heard and,\nhopefully, acted on.\nThere are, of course, the usual\nquota of students who never see their\npersonal tutors. Possibly many of\nthem have no wish to do so. And it's quite likely the tutor won't be able to\nhelp with coursework\u2014special is ation means that people often can't answer\nwith any authority questions on\nanything outside their own small\nfield. Frustrating indeed, but at least\n(if my tutor is anything to go by; and\nagain, surely I'm not the only lucky\none) the tutors are there to reassure\nand give the odd word of advice.\nSumming up is easy: I find my\ncourse fantastic fun (though you\nwouldn't guess it from the amount of\nwork I do\u2014charitably described as\nminimal) and if this is mainly because\nI love the subject, the lecturers in this\ndepartment have at least helped show\nit off at its most fascinating and\nchallenging.\n26 Wednesday 16th December 1987 FELIX\n\n"

So I took advantage of the early morning\nsun and settled down to watch the\nother clubs on that stretch of the\nRiver. An hour and three-quarters\nlater the IC oarsmen returned from\nup river. The top teams had been\nracing in eights in preparation for a race the next weekend. When they\nhad put the boats safely inside the\nBoathouse, I listened into one of Bill's pep talks, made arrangements to visit\nthe next day and bought a ticket for\ntheir annual dinner which was to be\nheld that night.\nThe dinner was a pleasant affair:\nthe guest speaker was Minister for\nSport Colin Moynihan, a former\nOlympic rower from Oxford and old\nfriend of Bill (who is fond of telling\nthe tale that he can remember Colin\nmooning at university). College\nSecretary John Smith and Assistant\nSecretary Michael Arthur were also\npresent, along with Union representative Charles Jackson, to\nreceive framed displays of victorious\nBoat Club teams as a token of their\ngratitude\u2014and, perhaps, as a non-too-subtle hint that more cash was needed.\nI met Ian Scutts, who is currently\nBelow Coach Bill Mason with a silver\nplatter presented to him by the Boat\nClub members as a mark of\nappreciation for all the hard work he\nhas put into the club. From left to\nright: Robert Gee, Bill Mason and\nColin Moynihan MP\nthe only top squad c oxen. This is his\nfinal year at Imperial and he revealed\nthat the Club is desperate for new\ncox ens to take his place when he\nleaves. He originally joined the Club\nwishing to become an oarsman but at\nonly 5ft7 in and a little over 8st he\nwas soon persuaded to become ac oxen. He told me that the c oxen is\nalways the scapegoat when a race is\nlost but the rowers get the glory when\na race is won. He certainly seemed\nto be the butt of most of the jokes at\nthe dinner but this didn't stop him\nfrom getting a large round of applause\nwhen he collected his World Student\nGames presentation oar.\nGuy Pooley, who was one of the\nteam which won the Visitors Cup and\nwent to the Student Games, was also\nseated at my table. He has since left\nImperial and gone to Cambridge and\nit is confidently predicted that he will\nstroke in this year's University Boat\nRace.\nWith the Olympics in 1988, the\nClub is sure that at least one member\nwill be selected to row for Great\nBritain in Korea.\nThe next day I made sure that I arrived in plenty of time before the\nboats went out. It gave me an\nopportunity to talk to some of the\nrowers. I asked them why they chose\nto spend every morning down on the\nRiver. The replies they gave were\nsimilar: everybody talked about the\ngroup identity and the sense of\nbelonging they felt. They also\nmentioned their enjoyment of winning\nand being part of a successful club.\nOne person told me that he enjoyed\nrowing because it was one of very few\nsports where dedication and hard\ntraining were enough to make you top\nclass. Another believed that Imperial\nrowers were prepared to put so much\ntime into rowing and training because\nthey wanted to please Bill. They all\nderive a child-like pleasure from\nmaking Bill proud of them.\nI asked one rower if he found it\ndifficult to have to do so much\ntraining every day. He said that it was\nquite the opposite: 'you just have to\ntrain, even when you're on holiday,\notherwise you start to twitch.'\nBill had prepared a punishing\ntraining schedule for the top squad.\nHe had decided that they would take\nthe smaller boats and keep to 26\nAbove Ian Scutts, top squad c oxen, proudly shows off his presentation oar\nat the Boat Club Dinner\nstrokes per minute. I followed in a launch with the new coach who gave\nthem tips on technique and timed their\nstrokes. David Hudson demonstrated\njust how easy it is to capsize a scull\nwhen he got caught up with another\nboat just before Hammersmith\nBridge. It was just as we were\nbeginning to make the return journey\nthat the heavens opened and we all got\ndrenched by cold, penetrating rain. I was glad to get back to the shelter of\nthe Boathouse, although the rowers\ndidn't seem the least bit upset by the\ndownpour.\nBill came out to ask me how I had\nenjoyed the trip down the river. T thought it was great until it started to\nrain'. 'They all enjoy it until they get\nwet', he quipped to a friend. I decided\nio make a prompt exit in search of a riot cup of coffee and some warm\nclothes.\nFELIX Wednesday 16th December 1987 19\n\n"

I have even\ndecided to set some competitions for\nthose of you who will not spend the\nwhole of Christmas out of your\nminds. The cartoons are from a well\nknown science magazine.\nWhat scientists want\nfor Christmas\nLast year New Scientist asked some\nfamous scientists what they were\nasking Father Christmas for. Some of\nthe answers are worth repeating.\nProfessor Igor Aleksander, of\nImperial College, wanted a full\nemulation of the human brain in\nsilicon chips. I would be inclined to\ndismiss this as arrogant, if he hadn't also said that he wanted it so people\nwould no longer have to stick wires\nin animals' heads to find out how\nbrains work.\nRoy Gibson, the former director of\nthe British National Space Centre,\ndecided to give Santa some advice.\nHe thought that the reindeer-powered\nsledge was a bit primitive, and that\nthe whole operation should move onto\nHotol, the proposed European\nreusable space plane. Unfortunately,\nthe Government has decided that such\nthings are a waste of time, and Roy\nGibson has consequently resigned.\nBrian Oakely, then director of the\nAlvey programme, wanted everyone\nto be made to study both arts and\nsciences until the end of their first\nyear at university. This is a good idea,\nnot so much because scientists will be\nable to write their PhD's in Latin, but\nbecause the people who run the\ncountry might then remember what\nscience actually is. Most of them are\narts graduates at the moment, and all\nthey know about science is that it costs\nmoney and ought to be abolished.\nWhat I want for Christmas is an\nadvertising eli minato r. This device\nwill make a fortune for its inventor.\nIt will shield the wearer from all\nforms of advertising, such as the\nincessant Curry's Motors ads on\nCapital Radio. The device will plug\nthe users ears and darken his glasses\nwhenever an advert is detected. A lot\nof us will be very grateful.\nAngel Gabriel cited\nin surrogate\nparenthood case\nOne of the little competitions set by\nNew Scientist in past festive seasons\nhas been to think up pla usable scientific news headlines. The above\nheadline (recently unearthed by\narchaeologists) is from the science\npage of the Jerusalem Weekly\nGrapevine, sometime around 2 AD. It is interesting to note that Gabriel\nwould now be liable for prosecution\nunder both the surrogate motherhood\nlaws and the proposed new laws on\nexperimentation on embryos.\nThough, of course, the Bishop of\nDurham wouldn't believe any of it.\nOther notable headlines in the\nhistory of science have been US\nSurgeon Uses Barbed Electric\nEndoscope: Shock horror probe and\nDr Fuchs Off to Antarctica. The\nsecond one is real, Dr Vivien Fuchs\nwas a famous polar explorer.\nThe\nSciTech\nChristmas\nSpecial\nHowever, neither of these is\nseasonally topical. Your task, should\nyou choose to accept it, is to think up\nseasonally topical scientific headlines.\nAny good ones will be published in\nFELIX, and the best one may get a substantial prize, if it's good enough.\nNew Year and\npredicting the future\nApart from amusing themselves,\nscientists also spend Christmas\nspeculating about the future. Not that\nthere is one for science in Britain, but\nit keeps their minds occupied. Here\nare some predictions, of what life\nwould be like in the 1980s, made by\nscientists in Scientific American in the\nearly 1880s. Chops and steaks will be cooked by\nelectric sparks...\nNot bad, but they missed\nvegetarianism.\nThe fruits of the earth will be\nmultiplied enormously by the use of\nelectric light behind coloured glass...\nOK,. no problems here, but they\nfailed to predict the fad for naturally\ngrown organic whole food. Air and water will be purified from\nall germs of disease, while air will not\nbe breathed by human beings until it\nhas been cleared of all noxious\nqualities...\nSo they got air-conditioning and\nchlorination of the water supply right,\nbut they missed Legionaires Disease,\nwhich breeds in air-conditioning, and\nnitrate pollution of the water supply,\nwhich is caused by intensive farming.\nIf food can be produced by\nimproved methods at less cost, then\nthe problem of poverty is solved...\nAh, at last, a complete cock up. We\ncan produce enough food to feed\neverybody cheaply, in fact we pile it\nhigh in warehouses and let it rot. But\nwe haven't solved the problem of\n12 Wednesday 16th December 1987 FELIX "

    "content": "ett ers JO:\nCost of CERN Dear Ms Hackney,\nCould I, as a particle physicist, comment on some of\nSteve Black's points on British membership of CERN in\nlast week's FELIX? It is true that SER C is desperately\nshort of money and that the CERN subscription is a major\nitem on its budget. The cost of CERN is shared between\nthe 14 member countries in proportion to their GDP's but\npayment is in Swiss francs and changes in currencies can\nplay havoc with budgets which the Government insist must\nbe cash-limited in pounds. As far as I know Britain is\nunique in paying such subscriptions directly from its\nscience budget but I don't think that the Foreign Office,\nwhich itself often faces similar problems, is a better\nalternative.\nI see particle physics very much as a part of science \u2022\nand to my mind it should be judged ultimately from this\nstandpoint. We all find ourselves on this strange planet,\nfor a brief time and surrounded by a fascinating\nuniverse\u2014fascinating on the big scale and the small;\nfascinating in its complexities and its s implicit ies. Of\ncourse we don't need to think about such things though\nprobably everyone does on occasion and certainly it is one\nof the driving ideas for a place such as Imperial.\nIn justification of research such as at CERN let me\ntherefore first refer to the science. One asks what are things\nmade of and where do forces come from? As one probes\nwith this question and does experiments, down past atoms\nand nuclei a strange world of mesons, baryons and leptons\nappears, a world in which matter and an it matter have equal\nfooting, a world in which the familiar electrons and protons\nare seen as merely the lightest, and therefore stable\nparticles of their kind. One goes further and there is a major advance (the Electroweak theory of Salam and\nWeinberg) and suddenly a great unifying pattern is seen\nin which things as disparate as electricity, beta decay and\ngravity appear similar and questions such as 'why is the\nhydrogen atom neutral?' and 'why do particles have mass?'\ntake on a new, profound significance. All such ideas have\nto work hand in hand with experiments and the history\nof the subject has been one of interplay between theory\nand experiment; as you can well imagine given a theory\nsuch as the Electroweak, experimenters are driven to do\nwhatever they can to test and try it out, even to the extent\nof pooling their resources on an international and\nsometimes world-wide scale.\nLooking back over the last twenty years or so let me\nmention briefly some of the areas in which particle physics\nhas directly impacted on other branches of science and\ntechnology. There is the whole area of accelerator\ntechnology, eg the use of synchrotron radiation from\nelectron storage rings for a host of studies on atomic and\nmolecular structures. There has always been an intense\nconcern with particle detectors, from the days of geiger\ncounters and electron-sensitive emulsions to such as PET( Positron Emission Tomography) currently being applied\nto problems in chemical engineering and brain metabolism.\nOne can think of the drive to faster electronic processing,\npattern recognition and scientific computers. There is\nmuch interaction between the theory and Mathematics,\neg Group theory, non-linear phenomena and phase\ntransformations. There are whole new insights into\ncosmology. In all these areas particle physics has\nencouraged, and sometimes initiated growth.\nThe British Government (as there is an International\nTreaty it is ultimately a Government, not SER C decision)\nmay decide to withdraw from CERN, the essential\nargument being, as Steve Black implies, that the country\ncannot afford it. This to me is a measure of the par lou s state to which support for basic science as across the\ndisciplines has fallen in the UK and the low esteem in\nwhich it is at present held. Can we really argue that, in\norder to support obviously important areas of chemistry\nor molecular biology or for example research into high\ntemperature superconductors the country .has to give up\nresearch into particle physics (or whatever would be next\nin line)? Ultimately this is what it is about. It is astonishing\nto me also that our great chemical industry\u2014as typified\nby ICI, our great electronics industry (eg GEC), and our\ngreat petroleum and mining industries (possibly including\nBP), still do so little to foster science and scientists in our\nuniversities in the areas Steve mentions. Science just now\nis 'piggy in the middle' between Government and industry\nand we all need to do what we can to convince both of\nthem that it is not just the City of London that needs to\ntake a longer-term view. I think, and hope, that this may\nbe starting to happen.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Binnie.\nSDI ethics\nDear Steve,\nThank you for an outspoken editorial on science and\nvalues (FELIX Nov 27)\u2014even more so in the light of some\npeople's argument 'that there is no place for such opinions\nin a page about science.'\nHowever, if science is ever to become a science for\npeople (not for industry\u2014we've been treated to this variant\nfor a whole year) then a few more scientists like Woodruff\n(or indeed those 50 UK scientists who signed a pledge\nrefusing to participate in Star Wars condemning SDI as\ntechnically dubious) will not do.\nWhat is called for is not more truthfulness\u2014this is where\nprofessional ethics start, not end\u2014but radical rethinking\nof scientific positivism. Far from being neutral, technology\ninvolves major value judgements by choosing to adopt a technological worldview and the SDI controversy is highly\nilluminating in this regard.\nAny criticism of SDI centering around technical\nin feasibility testifies to a thinking arrested in 'neutral\ntechnology' categories. SDI is about substituting\ntechnological for political rationality and it is this decision\nand all its implications that need to be challenged by\nconcerned scientists.\nYours sincerely,\nJobst Treiber (Elec Eng PG).\nSilly letter\nDear Judith,\nA copy of your publication, if swallowed by a small\nchild, could easily lead to choking.

If he wishes to ridicule me I have\nno objections at all, but, I deeply resent his deliberate\nimplication that I support infanticide.

Next time Mr Soane, confine your\ncomments to the written content when crit i sizing \u2014only\nthe lowest scum of the Earth sinks to the level that you\ndid last week, surely you're not always like that?\nYours hopefully (and with some reservation\nabout politeness),\nSteven Mercer (Physics 3).\nIC discipline\nis a farce\nDear Judith,\nI write with reference to a meeting of the College\nDisciplinary Committee (12.12.87) in which the matter\nof discussion revolved around an incident report in FELIX concerning the assault on Union Bar Manager, Adrian\nJohnson in which he was attacked with a glass.\nThe committee in question imposed a fine on Mr Marchant of \u00a325, the Royal School of Mines also imposed\na fine on him of \u00a315.\nI would just like to say that for the seriousness of the\noffence, a \u00a340 fine is appalling. Working behind the bar\nknowing someone can hit you, glass you, whatever and\nreceive such a small fine is worrying.\nYours sincerely,\nA member of bar staff (name and address supplied).\nConman-a misapprehension\nDear Judith,\nI would just like to take this opportunity to use this small\namount of space available to correct a widely held\nmisapprehension among Imperial College students and\nstaff.\nIt has come to my attention, during months of extensive\nresearch costing thousands of pounds and using the latest\nin hi-tech equipment that some things are not quite as they\nseem. More research has revealed that what I have\ndiscovered is not a new phenomena, but is unearthed about\nthis time of year by a radical non-conformist.\nUnfortunately, there is a mass campaign, led from very,\nvery high up in the government, the military, industry,\ncommerce and academia to suppress this information. I think that this is unacceptable in a democratic society and\nI hope that Judith will ignore the injunctions and go ahead\nand publish these allegations.\nAnd now the time has come to reveal the truth: Santa\nClaus does not exist!\nHe was created by advertising agencies in an attempt\nto con little kids into asking their parents for excessive\namounts of presents, and is being sustained by this wicked\ngovernment for the benefit of its friends in the City.\nI hope this revelation will not spoil Christmas for your\nreaders, disappointing as it must be.\nWishing all your readers a very merry Christmas and\na happy New Year.\nYours seasonally,\nAdrian M Bourne.\nNo ill-feeling\nDear Judith,\nLast week's issue of FELIX( No 787) contained a letter\nfrom Emma Barrett, the outgoing Rag Secretary, which\nraised a few points that have to be clarified.\nFirstly, Emma has resigned as Rag Secretary because\nshe is dissatisfied with her course and is in the process\nof leaving College. She has not resigned over the 'Drink\na Pub Dry' incident at UL U. This brings me onto the choice of venue. Many\ncomplaints have been received in the past about the price\nof beer in the pub chosen for the event. UL U was chosen\non the grounds that the beer was reasonably cheap and\nany profits made would benefit students. The person\nEmma quoted in her letter was myself, but unfortunately\nit was out of context. When I was asked by Emma at the\nbeginning of a Rag Meeting why we went to ULU,I, knowing that Emma is a member of C ND and the Labour\nParty, replied 'they are a bunch of lefties and we hate\nthem.' At the time most people, including Emma, found\nit amusing. I'm disappointed that she reported it as a serious reason for choosing UL U. The same applies to\nmy comment about Ian.\nAs to the matter of being offered 50% off the profits\nfrom a local pub well, I'm afraid Emma got her facts very\nwrong! The interested 'local pub' was a snooker club in\nHolborn. We were offered 10% of their profits on the\ncondition we had at least 250 people. The 10% of the\nprofits to Rag interested me until I found out that bitter\nwas \u00a31.30 per pint. I hope now that people will realise\nwhy I decided to go to UL U after all. The ill-feeling between IC and UL U has now been sorted\nout. I spoke to UL U President John Tilsead, and Vice\nPresident (Services) Norm Robinson, on Monday and they\ninformed me that they also felt that 'London Student' had\nexaggerated the incident. They also said that no action\nwas to be taken as I returned most of the signs last Friday.\nI hope this has cleared up any misunderstanding about the\nevent.\nIt has been decided that the Rag Exec (the Rag Officers\nand the C CU VPs) will look into all the events in Rag\nWeek and consider their viability for next year. I for one\nwill be very surprised if 'Drink a Pub Dry' and for that\nmatter 'Morphy Day', appear on next year's timetable.\nYours sincerely,\nNigel D Baker, IC Rag Chairman.\nFELIX Wednesday 16th December 1987 37\n\n"

    "content": "JUDO\nMaking the grade\nThe IC Judo Club organised and held\nits first grading competition for low\ngrades on Saturday December 5. In\ntotal, 7 women and 16 men from IC\nand other London colleges competed.\nEveryone had at least three fights, and\nwe were fortunate in that only one\nplayer sustained a minor wrist injury.\nAll those from IC fought well, and\nwere graded accordingly. Of the\nnovices, Juliet White, Jon Bird, Craig\nHolmes and Steve Delaney were\npromoted to 8th Kyu( lower orange)\nwhile Brian Sentance and Stuart\nWheaton were awarded 7th Kyu( upper or range). Of the graded\nplayers, Mylan Lester was promoted\nfrom 8th to 7th Kyu, and Henry\nYoung from 7th to 6th Kyu. Unfortunately, Yoke-Foong Tan,\nwho had fought well for London\nUniversity the week before in\nLeicester, was unable to compete due\nto a shoulder injury she had picked\nup earlier in the week in training.\nAfter the grading, the examiner\ncommented on the high standard that\nthe novices had reached after only 8\nweeks of Judo\u2014they had all been\npromoted from white to orange\njumping over yellow belt. This is a credit to both their dedicated\nenthusiasm and the excellent coaching\nof Paul Warren (3rd Dan) and Peter\nSwettenham (l st Dan).\nTENPIN BOWLING\nDemolished\nIC 8 - Kent2 Last Wednesday IC stretched their\nlong unbeaten run with a convincing\nvictory over Kent University.\nRight from the start, our bowlers\njustified their fearsome reputation\nwithin the UC TBA. Skipper Paul\nGaines, leading by example, opened\nup with a magnificent 203, inspiring\nhis teammates Garman Wong( showing no reaction to last week's broken leg) and Roger Allen to\nmemorable performances.\nThe B team, led as usual by Steve\nRussell and including Chi Chan and\nthe new rising star Paul Young\n(scorer of the second 200 of the day)\ncrushed the Kent B team. The IC C squad comprising the legendary\nMartin 'Moggy' Morris, Scott Waye,\nBen Surtees and Simon Phillips\ncontinued the demolition by\ndestroying their opponents with a clinical display of text book bowling.\nThe two points that did fall Kent's way were due to IC having an\nunder strength ladies team (what a surprise!). In fact Christine Li, Andrina Wiles and Katie Rhodes\n(slightly jaded from the previous\nnight's activities) battled gallantly\nonly to lose by the narrowest margin\nto their Canterbury counterparts.\nIf you think you can take more\ndrama than Dynasty, more excitement\nthan Eastenders and more notoriety\nthan Neighbours, then come bowling\nwith IC\u2014meet opposite Beit Arch\n(outside Aero Eng) on Wednesday at\n2.20pm. HOCKEY\nReferee\u201411\nIC l sts \u20144\nEssex University l sts \u20141\nHaving only finished second in their\nU AU group, IC l sts had to play a qualifying game in order to enter the\nlast 16 of the competition. Imperial\nreceived a dream start inside 20\nseconds with a goal made and scored\ndown the left by Hari Vamadevan.\nBouncing back straight away Essex\nforced a short comer which, if it were\nnot for the reactions of the goalie Cole\nSlatter, would certainly have found\nthe net. When placed under\noccasional pressure Imperial all too\noften resorted to stick tackles. These\nresulted in a spate of short corners,\none of which rewarded Essex with\ntheir equal ising penalty flick goal. By\nhalf time all 11 of the IC side had\nreceived a warning green card, with\nGary Knaresborough having been\nsent off.\nIn the second half, Brendan Farmer\ncame on at left half for John Rose.\nHowever Imperial continued to play\nwith great spirit and some skill. Soon,\nwith yet another wobble into the ' D', the inspirational Vamadevan won a penalty flick. Jim Garside left the\ntrendy Essex goalie with no chance.\nFrom then on IC, supported by an\nenthusiastic crowd, swamped Essex\nwith superb hockey resulting in two\nscorching goals. Paul Skipworth\nscored IC's corner, and Gary\nKnaresborough rounded things off\nwith an undercut shot into the same\nspot. This result earns the l sts an\nenviable trip away to Bristol.\nKARATE\nDon't medal with them\nOn Sunday December 16 the British\nStudents' Karate Championships were\nheld at Crystal Palace. Imperial\nCollege together with some other\nUL U clubs submitted a 'London\nUniversity' team, many of whose\nmembers were from IC. The\ncompetition was fierce with 27 teams\nrepresented and upwards of 300\ncompetitors, however we succeeded\nin coming away with a hand 'full'\nwith 24 medals and one trophy. We\nwere also runners up for the\nKeinosuke Enocda trophy awarded to\nthe team with the best aggregate\nperformance, with a particularly\nstrong Cambridge team just beating\nus.\nCredible performances were given\nall round with the ladies excelling\nthemselves and winning a total of 12\nmedals amongst the three of them!\nMeiken Engelstad took 2 gold medals\nfor individual kumi te( sparring)\u2014the\nBUS F( British Universities Sports\nFederation) and the BSSF (British\nStudents Sports Federation) medals,\nwith Sara Lindberg taking both\nbronze medals. Kate Taylor won the\nFENCING\nFoiling the opposition\nBSSF and BUS F silver medals for the\nindividual kata (fixed forms) when\nshe came second; and together the 3\nladies came first in the team kumi te removing all resistance with their\nstrong and aggressive style taking the\nBUS F and BSSF gold medals as well\nas a huge trophy awarded for the\n'pursuit of excellence' in the ladies'\nteam kumi te. The men, though not faring quite\nas well, competed with good spirit\nand some excellent results were\nachieved. Not only was the whole\nteam second best on aggregate but the\nmen's team kata gained the BSSF and\nBUS F bronze medals, only narrowly\nmissing silver and Paul Potter,\nKenrick Sayers, Paul Urbona, Osama\nKawafi and Bob-Alonge all but\nproved unstoppable, winning bronze\nmedals for the team kumi te when they\nwere eventually defeated by the\neventual winners.\nMany thanks to those who took part\nfor trying so hard and doing so well\nand thanks to Caesar Andrews for\ncoaching and guiding us to eventual\nvictory.\nOn Saturday November 28, IC hosted\nthe first round of the U AU Fencing\nChampionship for both South East\nSouth Division and the South East\nNorth Division in the Great Hall. The\nwhole day was a great success\nespecially for our teams. Many thanks\nto everyone who helped the day go\nsmoothly, especially Simon Heaps for\nall his help and Peter Cripwell for\npresiding over the sabre competition.\nIn the South East North Divison\nonly UCL and City University were\ncompeting. UCL have a very strong\nteam this year. They beat City 7-2 in\nthe sabre; 8-1 in the foil and 6-3 in\nthe e pee. This gave them an overall\nvictory of 21-6. UCL did not bring\na ladies team and therefore the City\nladies' foil team went through by\ndefault.\nMeanwhile the South East South\nDivision kicked off with the Sabre\ncompetition and our star sabre ur, Simon Holden, managed to lose his\nfirst fight a very close 1-5! However,\nafter this somewhat worrying start\nthey then went on to beat Surrey 5-4!\nNext came the men's foil with Peter\nCripwell and Ron Tham in very good\nform each winning all three of their\nfights leading to a72 victory.\nThe last weapon in the men's competition Was the e pee. By this\ntime they only needed two more fights\nto win. To add to the excitement Peter\nand Adam (who was not hungover\nthis time) bet vast amounts of alcohol\non their performance. Needless to say\nthis spurred the e pee team into a resounding 8-1 victory with our\nillustrious captain, Simon, the only\none to lose a fight and Peter four pints\ndown on the match. The overall result\nthen was a207 victory over Surrey\nUniversity, putting us through first to\nthe next round with Surrey runners\nup.\nThe highlight of the day was the\nladies' foil which we won 5-4 despite\nCaroline's injured knee and Sophia's lack of experience. Well fenced\nSophia! We then had a friendly match\nagainst City ladies. After seeing both\nCaroline and Sophia lose against two\nvery aggressive City Ladies, Clare\nstepped onto the p iste with some\n. trepidation. She lost this first fight 5-4\nand then redeemed herself by winning\nthe other two. Overall City beat IC\n, 5-4 in a very close match.\nFELIX Wednesday 16th December 1987 35\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX THE ALTERNATIVE PAGE\nRIDING ANTE\nTHE LOPE\nby Earl Grey\nI was in Earls Court Station waiting for\na tube when I was knocked senseless by\nan amazing conundrum.\n'Will running down an escalator\nincrease my chances of catching a train?'\nWhen I reverted to mathematical jargon\nand used lots of big words it become\napparent that the the probability of\ncatching a train is the same whether you\nrun down an escalator or not. Put it\nanother way\u2014if you wait on the,\nplatform long enough then a train will;\neventually turn up (barring nuclear war,j the abolition of London Underground!\nand Ian Howgate's underwear). It is\nobvious, even to i pygmy, that the\nprobability of catching a train must\nalways be one.\nBut, you might query; if a person runs\ndown the escalator will it increase his\nchances of catching the next train?\nIn order to analyse the problem\nproperly we must define what we mean\nby the next train.\nDefinition 1; The Next Train. The next\ntrain is defined to be the first train to\narrive on the platform taken from the\nmoment when the subject first sets foot\non the escalator.\nIt follows...\nDefinition 2; Catching the Next Train.\nThe Next Train is said to be caught when\nthe subject arrives on the platform when\nthe doors are open or in the process of\nopening.\nSimilarly...\nDefinition 3: Missing the Next Train.!\nThe Next Train is said to be missed!\nwhen the subject arrives on the platform'\nwhen the doors have closed or are in the\nprocess of closing.\nI It is obvious to anyone with half a| brain cell( Sorry Dave, no offence) that1 the probability of catching the next train\nwill depend upon the following,\nvariables... IT The time taken for a stationary\nsubject to reach the bottom of a particular escalator.\nC The coefficient of\nrunning down the escalator ness K Big KA The time taken for the Next Train\nto arrive, timed from the point when the\nsubject first steps foot on the escalator.\nW The waiting time between trains\nd The length of time the train is on\nthe platform with the doors open.\nIf we define Big K to be a constant\nequal to the time taken to run from the\nbottom of the escalator to the platform\nit is immediately obvious that the\nprobability of catching the train can be\nrepresented by the following Heaviside\nstep function.\n?=H(( fl+ d)( Lstk))\nIf P is 0, the subject will miss the\ntrain, and if P is 1 the train will be\ncaught. In ether words...\nxc Pel\ncc flew s fc lie between of iu)! Looking at this graphically...\nTropin is c aig ht, \u2014t wwi w\\ \u2014>\noI w nc Hence we can see that the probability\nof catching the Next Train can be\nrepresented by the following\nexpression...\nw What does this mean in practice?\nWell, if trains arrive every 300 seconds,\nthe escalator taking 30 seconds with a further 30 seconds to reach the platform\nand the train stays on the platform for\n20 seconds, and if we assume that the\ncoefficient of\nrunning down the escalator ness is 2 then\nthe probability of catching the train is\nfound to be 92%. Similarly, if we\nremain stationary on the escalator the\nchances of catching the next train are\nfound to be 86%. Amazing huh ! There\nHow To Be\nA Male\nChauvinist\nPig\nBy The Foreign Correspondents\nCleaning The Floor\nis only a an 8% improvement if you run\ndown the escalator.\nSpecial offer.

    "content": "Features IC EAST KARAKORAM EXPEDITION\nMoonlight on the Mountains\nBack in late July,\nwith Jeffrey\nArcher's reputation\nstill in the balance,\na rumour that the\nSoviets might\nactually back a zero-zero arms\nreduction option\nbeing bandied about\nand the US escort\nof re flagged supertankers just\ngetting underway,\nwe flew over the\nStraits of Hormuz\non our way from\nLondon to\nKarachi\u2014where a bombing a few\ndays earlier had\nkilled 50 and\ninjured 200.\nFrom Karachi we flew north to\nPakistan's capital, Islamabad (a showpiece city, still being built).\nThere we dealt with various bits of\nred tape and continued our application\nfor permission to carry out a Civil\nEngineering Research Project, with\nthe British Embassy exerting\ninfluence on our behalf. The\nexpedition was conceived asi a combined mountaineering effort and\n'road project'. Our road project\nwould have looked at the Indus\nHighway; a route hewn from the side\nof the Indus Gorge. Due to the\ngeological youth of the whole area\n(essentially the Karakoram is at the\nwestward end of the Himalayas) the\nroad is prone to frequent landslides,\nblocking and damaging it. We wanted\nto study and survey some of the\naffected areas and bring to bear up-to-date slope failure a nays is techniques. They have not been used\nin such a context before and as well\nas trying to suggest practical remedial\nmeasures, we hoped to break new\nground scientifically. However, after\nreceiving permission to go ahead\nfrom their Ministry of Defence, the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs politely\nrefused it. And that was that!\nThe result was a swift modification\nof our plans and saw all ten expedition\nmembers at the mountaineering base\ncamp together (possibly the first time\nwe'd all been together since the\nexpedition was conceived). To get\nthere we spent sixteen hours on a bus\ntravelling up the famous Karakoram\nHighway to Gilgit and a further eight\nhours on the Indus Highway ('our\nroad') over to Skardu.\nThen we followed in the footsteps\nof the big expeditions on their way up\nto K2 (the worlds second highest\nmountain) and the other big\nmountains up there. The relative ease\nof access and having a large fraction\nof the world's highest and hardest\nmountains makes the area a magnet\nfor the likes of Chris Bonnington.\nIndeed some of us met Doug Scott on\nhis way back from K2\u2014about to go\nto Everest!\nsee if we wanted to go home we saw\nno sign of humanity or its works\nexcept satellites in the ever clear,\nmagnificent night sky\u2014 and what we\nhad brought with us.\nThree people failed to acc lim at is e to the 4200m altitude of base camp\nand were also suffering from\ndys entry type problems.

There we hired\nporters and set off for the three day\njourney up into the mountain (turning\nleft off the K2 route after a day).\nMost of us spent the next seven\nweeks up there, eating rice and\ncha patti s every day, sunbathing and\nmountaineering. Apart from the\noccasional confused porter coming to\n\" \u00bb ^ \u201e \u201e ' i: \u201e . J& LS\nthey decided they'd had enough,\nreturned to Skardu, and after showing\nlittle improvement headed home.\nThe rest of us notched up four first\nascents, one or two new routes and\nseveral other climbs. We also mapped\nthe area, roughly speaking a bowl of\nsix-mile radius, ringed with high\nmountains, criss-crossed with several\nridges and glaciers\u2014almost a self-contained, private universe. Climbing\nto its edges and looking over the other\nside was quite an experience. We saw\nK2, the Ogre (a mountain on which\nDoug Scott and Chris Bonnington\nnearly died\u2014Scott descending on\nhands and knees with two broken\nlegs), the Biafo Glacier, Nanga Parbat\nand several other famous mountains.\nThe high point of the expedition\nwas the conquering of two un climbed peaks which we named Ice Horn\n(5000m) and White Peak (5500m). These were climbed on a three day\nattempt, including one night spent\nsleeping on a glacier at - 2 0 \u00b0 C( the\nfailure of the stove didn't help), in\nwhich the basic approach was to\nclimb up a i ong snow-ice gully onto\nWednesday 16th December 1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Rev i Bestseller\nBest Seller stars James Woods and\nBrian Dennehy two of the most\ninteresting and po we ful lesser-known\nHollywood actors who, here, have\nbeen given roles that couldn't be\nbetter designed for them (whether the\nscript was written with them in mind\nI know not). The story too is based\naround an interesting and clever idea\nand starts well.\nDennehy plays Dennis Meechum,\na policeman and writer, basing his\nfirst best seller on an incident during\nthe seventies when, during a robbery\non a police evidence storeroom, three\nof his friends are killed and he is\nwounded. Years later, after the death\nof his wife, he has difficulty writing\nand runs into financial trouble. At this\npoint the menacing character of Cleve\n(Woods) appears. He is a professional\nassassin who was involved in the\nearlier robbery and who now, after\nbeing cast aside by his employer Paul\nShenar, an extremely powerful\nbusinessman, seeks revenge by\noffering to expose his own and\nShenar's activities.\nTogether they set off across\nAmerica to collect the evidence that\nwill be needed to write the 'best\nseller' that will uncover Shenar. This\npart of the film is interesting, as the\nrelationship between the two men\ndevelops from antagonism and\nmistrust to an uneasy friendship. It\nbecomes clear, as Cleve describes in\ndetail and even shows off about how\ncleverly he has achieved, the ghastly\nkillings of his many victims, that he\nis a psychopath, and that his motives\nfor helping Meechum write the book\nare more inscrutable than they at first\nseemed. Does he want it to be a confession, an expurgation of his\nconscience or, more likely, as Cleve\nstruggles to make sure he is seen in\na comparatively good light, an epita th that paints him as some sort of hero.\nMeechum's motives too are unclear,\nhis main aim is to bring down Shenar,\nbut does he want to get Cleve too? He\ncertainly intends revenge for Cleve's involvement in the 70s killings, and\na confrontation seems inevitable.\nUnfortunately, from here the film\ndevelops none of these possibilities,\nCleve and Meechum unite to face the\ncommon enemy of Shenar and his\norganisation, and the film wends its\nextremely violent latter stages to a bloodbath ending that provides no\ninsights into any of the subtleties\nmentioned, and cops out of the\nconfrontation between the two lead\ncharacters.\nThe Dead\nDublin, 1904.\nOn a new year's evening, two\nelder y sisters\u2014Miss Kate and Miss\nJulia Morkan\u2014welcome their guests\nto their annual dance. Amongst the\nguests are Gabriel Conroy and his\nwife Gretta.\nThe dance proceeds smoothly\u2014a well-known drunk manages to avoid\ndisgracing himself, for a change.\nGabriel, who gives a speech about\nabsent friends, is suddenly struck by\nhis wife's pose on the staircase, as she\nlistens to another guest singing the\nold, mournful ballad 'The Lass of\nAughrim'.\nLater that evening, Gretta confesses\nto her husband that the ballad\nreminded her of an innocent love\nfrom her girlhood. The boy, who was\nailing, came through snow to bid her\nfarewell when she left the village, and\nsubsequently he died\u2014perhaps, she\nimagines, for love of her.\nGabriel, moved by her tears, and\nperhaps a shade jealous, feels a great\nemptiness inside him. He knows that\nhe has never known love like that.\nPutting aside the notoriety that The\nDead will undoubtedly gain, being\nJohn Huston's last film, it is\nnevertheless a virtually flawless\nadaption of James Joyce's marvellous\nshort story. There are one or two\nminor quibbles\u2014Joyce's text would\nbe better presented in the form of a voice over narration. In the story, the\nmoment where Gretta pauses on the\nstairs is one of graceful mystery;\nGabriel isn't even sure who the\nwoman is. In the film, due to lack of\nany direct communication between\nGabriel and the audience, the moment\nmust be more deliberately staged for\nhim, and thus it loses its mystery, and\nbecomes more of a pregnant moment.\nThe adaptation by Huston's son,\nTony, is excellent. The script\nmanages to capture all the exquisite\nand unmistakably Joycean\nelaborations and expansions that have\nmade the writer so famous and,\nintriguing. The final scenes, where\nGabriel looks out of the hotel window\nat the wintry landscape, after hearing\nhis wife's confession, exactly mirror\nJoyce's text:\n'Think of all those back in\ntime...this solid world\ndwindling...snow falling on that\nlovely graveyard... upon all the living\nand the dead.'\nIronically, the desolation and yet\nreconciliation in these words seems\nto mirror Huston's regretful\nacceptance of his own death.\nThe film is almost entirely plot less, the drama reduced to small moments.\nThe Dead is more like an orchestral\nwork\u2014the chorus conjures up one\nimage; the inevitability of death, and\nthe dreadful sense of waste which we\nall feel upon its eternal hovering\nabove us. Readers of English poet\nPhillip Larkin should have no trouble\nin comprehending these ideas.\nThe Dead is impeccably made and\ndirected, a typical change of direction\nby Huston after the relative\ncommercialism of. Prizzi's Honour.\nIt's a masterpiece, in which Huston\nhimself will live. It's by no means\nmainstream cinema, but should be\nseen, even if it's the first and last time\nyou go to see such a film.\nC.R.I found this disappointing to say the\nleast, since Woods and Dennehy, who\nboth perform well, are given some\nwitty and sharp dialogue and deserve\nbetter in the way of a plot. However,\nas is sadly too common in Hollywood\nthese days, the script has relented to\nthe pressures of commercialism and\nhas chosen the easy route of\nentertaining with 'glam' violence.\nA.K. Spaceballs\nI haven't actually seen this yet, but\nit's Mel Brooks writing, directing and\nacting, so it must be good!\nC.R. Bigfoot and the Hendersons\nThe Henderson Family, on holiday in\nthe mountains, literally run into the\nlegendary Bigfoot, and decide to take\nhim home, with hilarious results.\nNeed I say more? Perhaps a trifle\noverlong, but good for an afternoon\nwhen you feel like being a kid. This\nfilm is the first to come out for a long\ntime that is anti-gun and and-violence.\nC.R. Kershaw, Aidan\nAaron Kotcheff\nCharles Robin\nThomas Greig\n30 Wednesday 16th December 1987 FELIX "

    "content": "News Shooting at\nInternational\nWith the Hungerford Massacre still\nfrighteningly fresh in the mind, the\nnightmare of many International Hall\nstudents were realised last Friday\nwhen two students fired a round of\nblanks and threw tomato ketchup\naround during a crowded Christmas\nparty.\nThe shooting was carried out by a fresher from SSEES using a German\n8mm automatic pistol which had been\nadapted to fire blanks. Eye witnesses\nsaid that the student entered the Hall\nbar during the Christmas party and\nfired five times at a fellow student at\nclose range. This accomplice, a third\nyear, then threw copious amounts of\ntomato ketchup at the victim to\ncomplete the desired effect. However,\nas panic struck the bar staff and\ncustomers it was clear that the prank\nhad gone horrific ally wrong. Within\nseconds the police were on the scene\nand they attempted to seal off the bar\nat once but the assailants managed to\nescape.\nThe following morning the Hall bar\nmanager Peter Storker who had\nrecognised the gunman, decided to\ntake legal action. The charges which\nhave not yet been disclosed are likely\nto include illegal possession of a firearm, assault and disturbing the\npeace.\nA great time was had by all when the superb Real Sounds of Africa\nappeared in IC Union Lounge on Thursday 3rd December. The\nperformance included a mind-boggling contortionist and a witch doctor.\nThe band went down well in the packed Union Lounge so much so that\nnobody could stand still and a large percentage of the audience got up\nand danced on the stage at the end of the evening.\nProtest concert\nMembers of the College music\nsocieties held a protest carol concert\nyesterday lunchtime in the upper\nfoyer of the Sherfield Building. The\nSocial, Cultural and Amusements\nBoard Chairman, Richard Squire,\nsaid afterwards that he had organised\nthe concert to bring to the attention\nof the staff the anger that members of\nthe music societies felt when they\ndiscovered that they would be losing\nthe use of the Princes Gate Music\nRoom after Christmas. The room is\nto be used by the new School of\nManagement which took over the\nPrinces Gate buildings in the summer.\nMr Squire said that they had been\noffered an alternative room in the Old\nHolland Club; now part of the\nDepartment of Computing which was\n'fine up to a point'. He has written\na letter to the Rector stating his\nobjections to Terminal Room 4 being\nused for music. In it he points out that\nthe sound quality is poor, that the\nroom will not be available at\nlunchtime and that there is no room\nfor a piano and garage. He is also\nworried that Professor Sayers, Head\nof the Department of Computing, has\ntold him that permanent terminals will\nbe installed in the room in two years\ntime which will mean looking for a new room again.\nVC of OU hits out\nDr John Horlock, Vice Chancellor of\nthe Open Universtiy, has hit out at\npost experience engineering training\nin Britain. He believes that British\nengineers are trailing behind their\nEuropean counterparts. In an address\nat Heriot-Watt University he pointed\nout that French and German engineers\nhave a statutory entitlement to study\nleave to upgrade their skills.\nThe Engineering Council is\nexpected to announce plans for a major post-experience training\ninitiative designed to involve every\nengineer and technician in Britain.\nTashkent\ntrauma\nThe Soviet Union's Tashkent library\nhas expressed concern over the\nnumber of archived materials which\nare cut up or stolen. They believe that\nit is not vandalism that's to blame, but\nscholars who want to take away\nmaterials to read up on for their\nresearch projects. The reason that text\nis taken is that only 1,000\nphotocopiers are produced every year\nin the USSR and that official\nregulations specify that photocopiers\nmust be kept in a locked room which\nmay only be used by special\nphotocopying personnel!\nGalluping\nscience\nA Nationwide Gallup poll has\nrevealed that 81% of people asked\nsaid that they believe the nation's prosperity depends on science and\ntechnology.\nAwards\nThe Natural Environmental Research\nCouncil is to suspend an award round\nfor university grants in 1988. It has\nhad to do this to meet a cash crisis due\nto increases in salaries. It is also\nplanning to impose compulsory\nredundancies to meet a target loss of\n120 posts in the next academic year.\n4 Wednesday 16th December 1987 FELIX "

Particularly\nnotable achievements were the Rugby\n1st XV and Ladies' Squash V who\nwon all thier games. The complete list\nof teams who qualified automatically\nby winning their groups is:\nRugby l st XV,2 nd XV,3 rd XV Hockey2 nd XI Squash\u2014Ladies' V Fencing\u2014Men's, Ladies'\nThe following teams managed to\nsecure play-offs by coming either\nsecond or third in their groups:\nHockey\u20141st XI Badminton\u20141stV I,2n d VI,\nLadies' VI\nFootball-2nd XI,3 rd XI Squash\u20141stV Of these teams all but the football\nand squash teams progressed to the\nChallenge round (the top 16\nuniversities in the country).\nThis represents probably the best\nyear for Imperial College teams in the\nU AU Championships since our\naffiliation in 1983. I would like to\nextend the A CC's best wishes to these\nteams and wish them well for the first\nknock-out round in January.\nMark Harris, ACC Vice Chairman.\nVOLLEYBALL\nKey to success\nSometimes it is easy to get paranoid\nabout a club's luck. In recent years,\nthe U AU regional championships\nhave not always gone as planned for\nImperial. Two years ago, the men\nwere disqualified for fielding a woman after winning the final, and\nlast year, the entry form got lost in\nthe post (honest!), the team only\ngaining entry after turning up on the\noff-chance and grovelling profusely.\nThis year, it was going to be different.\nThis year, the key to the minibus\nsnapped off in the lock two hours\nbefore the start of the tournament...\nAll was not lost. After calming a near-hysterical secretary, the\nwomen's team just caught a train to\nBrighton and managed to arrive\nalmost, well nearly almost, on time.\nUpon presentation of half a van key,\nthe team was forgiven, and rushed on\ncourt to crush a strop py Brunei team\nin two quick sets. This glory was\nshort-lived, however, as despite some\nmagnificent spiking from Margaret\nAsomaning and Anna Dahlkvist, a well-drilled Sussex team snatched\nvictory in two sets which should have\ngone the other way. The women were\nstill in the semi-finals though by\nvirtue of the first win, to meet a very\nstrong Kent side. This produced the\nmost exciting match in both days of\nthe tournament, as IC met an\nopponent of similar spiking power.\nThroughout, the team were under\nstrong pressure, but fought strongly\ndue to the clean setting of captain\nKristina Sagen, Going one set down,\nthey recovered to take the second with\nLouisa Leung and Eleni Papa proving\nthe effectiveness of the intelligently\nplaced return, and Stephanie Samuels\ndisplaying remarkable reflexes on the\nback court. The third set went to 15\npoints apiece, but then Kent pulled\nahead to remove IC from the\ncompetition.\nThe next day saw the arrival of the\nmen's competition, which was not\nquite so exciting, despite attempts to\nliven things up with out mascot: an\ninflatable crocodile called\nPalookaville. The first match was\nagainst an initially impressive side\nfrom UEA, who collapsed under the\nsmouldering spikes of Walter Sextro\nand Steve Pickett. After that, it was\nall downhill...for the opposition.\nCrisp setting from Fernando\nGonzalez and Luca Grassano meant\nthat spikes fell in an almost\ncontinuous downpour. Sussex and\nCity both succumbed quickly, as did\nKent in the semi-finals, although they\ndid a nice synchronise d warm-up. The\nfinal re-introduced the men to UEA who seemed to have a certain hang\ndog look, but took eight points off\nImperial in the second set; the highest\ntally of the day. And now, after a two\nday trip to the seaside, without a minibus, it seems that Palookaville\nwill be heading North to the national\nfinals in Loughborough next year.\nMIXED HOCKEY\nAnna's traumas\nIC Mixed 2\u2014St Thomas (A)0 In a game dominated by IC, the ladies\nplayed a major role with Penny\ncausing trouble up front whilst Debbie\nfrustrated the oppositions advances.\nIC's first goal was scored by Penny\nafter a break by Paul Hanrahan. His\nshot beat the keeper but was cleared\noff the line. However, Penny made\nsure of the rebound.\nSome excellent goal keeping by\nSpence, who is accustomed to playing\nwith his feet, helped to maintain this\nlead into the second half, during\nwhich Brenan Farmer came off to\nincrease the standard of umpiring.\nShrewd tactics by Dave Jennings\nand Benjamin Turner at defensive\nshort corners ensured that no shots\nwould go in at the near post. Also in\ndefence, the diminutive Anna distinguished herself after squaring up\nto a one-on-one with their centre\nforward. She bravely laid in a solid\ntackle which not only stole the ball\nfrom the forward but left him crashing\nto the the ground.

    "content": "R%y i ews A Midsummer\nNight's Dream\nRSC, Barbican\nAs a Christmas show, A Midsummer\nNight's Dream seems ideal:\nShakespearean culture for the adults\nand lots of fairies for the children of\nall ages, roughly 0 to 90. The RSC's current production makes sure that\nboth aspects are well enjoyed.\nThe production takes us back\nseveral decades and provides us with\na delightful visual spectacle, although\nthe time change is only relevant to the\nhumans, fairies being timeless\ncreatures as any Peter Pan devotee\nwill tell you.\nThe story concerns two sets of\nlovers, only one pair of whom\nactually returns their love. Poor\nHelena loves Demetrius, who only\nhas eyes of Hermia, who is loved by\nand loves Lysander. Kathryn Pogson\nturns in a superb performance as\nHelena, and her argument with\nHermia, re Lysander's sudden\ninfatuation with her, is undoubtedly\none of the best staged moments of the\nplay. All the sudden changes in\npeoples' infatuation, are caused by\nPuck, aide to Oberon king of the\nTHEA WE\nfairies, who goes around putting\nmagic potion into the eyes of all the\nwrong people. Mr Woodeson is\nassured and witty as Puck and his\nobvious acting ability does wonders\nwith what are already wonderful\nlines. As a sidekick to Oberon he is\nperfect and a complete opposite to the\nsomewhat harsh portrayal of Oberon\nby Gerard Murphy.\nWhilst the fairies are on the whole\nlight of foot and delightfully quick,\nOberon's dance with his queen\nTitania, looked sadly out of place and\nboth Mr Murphy and Ms Tomelty\n(Titania) looked surprisingly\nuncomfortable.\nIt is however for the great\nperformance of the whole that it will\nbe remembered and it is a considerable compliment to say that\nvery rarely does one think about the\nage of the language or the fact that\nmuch of it is written in rhyming\ncouplets.\nSo if you are bored with Tinkerbell,\nlet Puck do the entertaining this\nChristmas.\nK.A. MM\nInnerspace\nAmi naturi sed one-man submersible\nis accidently injected into a supermarket cashier, who thinks that\nhe's possessed. He then has to go on\na wild madcap chase to retrieve the\nsilicon chip needed to re-enlarge the\nintruder. Foreign electronics buyers\nand nasty industrialists complicate\nmatters.\nThis is the latest offering from\nSteven Spielberg/Joe Dante, and has\nthe same problems/advantages of all\nthe others; fast moving plots with\nholes through which you could drive\na double decker bus, moments of\nhilarious screwball comedy, moments\nof unutterable silliness. In other\nwords, great entertainment. And if the\nplot sounds familiar, it's because the\nfilm is a sort of remake of Fantastic\nVoyage, with Racquel Welch. Innerspace sports its own beauty:\nMeg Ryan, last seen in Top Gun.\nC.R.

Our Village\nis a collection of sketches of rural\ncharacter and scenery that includes\nsuch topics as a country cricket\nmatch, various character studies of\nneighbours and descriptions of\ncountry walks throughout the year.\nNot just a charming period piece, or\neven a social history, but the\nmemories and reflections of a warm\nand resilient woman.\nPublished by Penguin, \u00a33.95.\nThe Official Doctor's Joke Book\nby Larry Wilde\nI am not sure which body authorised\nthis book as official, except that it\ncertainly was not the British Medical\nAssociation. The book is an import\nfrom the States, with the only\nalteration for the English edition being\nthe price on the cover. On the inside\nis American spelling, American\nlanguage and American money, as\nwell as the most appalling American\nhumour at its very worst. Not a single\njoke managed to produce a laugh, not\neven from the doctor I tried a couple\nout with. Don't bother considering\ngetting this book if you have a sense\nof humour.\nBantam, \u00a31.95\nAllen Ginsberg-Collected\nPoems 1987-1980\nAn extraordinary collection of poems\nby an extraordinary man; Allen\nGinsberg is a man of many faces:\nJew, Buddhist, ancient sage, 'enfant\nterrible', tragic dynamic, and his\npoetry reflects this: read aloud s, incantations, drug-induced\nhallucinations and tender, explicit'\nlove poems. This book gives a unique\nrecord of life lived at the raw end\nduring the last four decades in most\nplaces you've always wanted to get\nto or out of. Ginsberg is a major\nAmerican poet, a great influence in\nthe American political voice and a lyrical genius.\nPublished by Penguin, \u00a39.95.\nRewards and Fairies\nby Rudyard Kipling\nI will look forward this Christmas to\ntoasting me toes in front of a roaring\nfire each evening and indulging\nmyself in Kipling' s delightful\ncontinuation of Puck of Pook Hill,\nRewards and Fairies. If I am in luck\nthe mince pies will last long enough\nto read a couple of the short stories,\nbut if not I shall have to content\nmyself with one of Kipling's classic\npoems that are scattered through the\nbook.\nThe title and first appearance\nsuggest this is a child's book, but I don't know any children who could\npossibly appreciate the magic in\nKipling's writing.

    "content": "a ture And what about fake furs?\nIt seems that neither Lynx nor the\nBritish Fur Trade Association want\npeople to wear fake furs. The B FT A complain that there is nothing like a real fur and that many synthetic\nmaterials have contributed to\natmospheric pollution, acid rain and\ndestruction of natural habitats.\nMeanwhile Lynx believe that fake\nfurs keep alive the notion that wearing\nfurs is acceptable and desirable.\nFur factories?\nFur farms are situated all over the\nworld, with most being found in\nRussia, Scandinavia and North\nAmerica. Each year more than 40\nmillion animals are farmed for use in\nthe fur trade which amounts to 85 %\nof all furs used worldwide. The rest\nis trapped, most of which is done with\nthe agreement of various governments\nwhich are trying to keep wild animal\npopulations down.\nIn Scandinavia alone, there are\naround 11,000 fur farms. In the UK there are only 70 farms, 90% farm\nmink and the rest farm arctic blue fox\nor fitch. The Fur Breeders\nAssociation recommends that mink\ncages should not be less than two\ncubic feet with two animals to a cage\nplus access to a nest box or pen.\nSo is farming cruel?\nLynx claim that mink farming is cruel\nbecause wild mink are solitary, highly\nterritorial animals which have\nterritories of around 2 miles of\nriverbank area and that 2 cubic feet\nis not sufficient. They say that\nselective breeding has induced stone\ndeafness, tail sucking, ear chewing\nand fur clipping. They also object to\nthe methods of killing used:\nbarbiturate injection, inhalation of\ncarbon monoxide and neck\ndislocation.\nFur traders are keen to hit back at\naccusations of cruelty. Why, they\nargue, should they cause cruelty or\nstress to the animals because if an\nanimal is badly looked after it will\nshow in its coat. A healthy, well-looked after mink's skin will always\nbe worth many times more than a lack\nlustre one. They also point out that\nmink farms are not factory farms. The\nanimals live outside in natural light\nand are not fed any steroids, drugs or\nother substances designed to promote\ngrowth artificially. They also mate\nand breed naturally and artificial\ninsemination is not used. They say\nthat the most common method of\nslaughter is anaesthetic overdose\nwhich first an aes thetis es and then\nkills. It is the same method that vets\nuse to put down small domestic pets.\nMark Glover of Lynx still argues\nthat farming is sophisticated and too\nscientific and that the needs of the\ncreatures themselves are paid little or\nno heed. He also believes that the\nfoodstuffs used to feed mink are a 'scandalous waste of resources,\nparticularly when so many people\nface starvation.' I put this to a member of the B FT A who said that\nat least 80% of the food fed to mink\nand foxes is offal and by-products of\nthe human food industry such as cattle\ntripe, fish offal and car cases. It seems\nthat the B FT A can show their\nmethods of farming to be more\nhumane than any chicken or veal\nfarm.\nTrapping?\nLynx have much better grounds for\ntheir campaign when they present the\nfacts about trapping. All trapping in\nBritain is illegal although around\n100,000 red foxes are snared or\ntrapped illegally with gin traps each\nyear in the UK. They have evidence\nthat trapped animals go to desperate\nlengths to escape. The stomachs of\ntrapped arctic foxes often contain\nparts of their own bodies such as teeth\nfragments (broken off whilst the\nanimal bits the trap) or parts of\nmangled feet, claws or bits of bones.\nMost trapping is done in North\nAmerica but only 1% of it by\naboriginals who have made it their\nlivelihood for centuries. The trapping\nregulations in the USA vary from\nstate to state. Animals are commonly\nleft in traps for two or three days. If\nthey are still alive when the trapper\nfinds them, they are killed by\nclubbing or strangulation. The most\ncommon form of trap is the leg hold trap. A particular type of leg hold trap\ncalled the gin trap has been banned\nin 64 countries including the UK and\nhas been described as a 'diabolical\ninstrument which causes an incredible\namount of suffering'. Despite this the\nUK imports 2 million wild animals\nwhich have been caught using leg hold traps.\nThe B FT A accept these figures but\npoint out that 85% of fur used by\nBritish fur traders is from farms and\nthat trapping is no reason to ban fur\ncompletely.\nThe Canadian Government is a fervent supporter of trapping as a form of pest control. They have\nproduced many propaganda sheets on\nwhy trapping is the best method and\nhow many people's livelihoods would\nbe taken away if trapping was banned.\nThey say that such animals cannot be\nshot as it is ineffective against the\nspecies which are mainly nocturnal.\nAll the trappers are trained and\nlicenced. They also have quotas\nwhich they must not exceed.\nCanadian trappers also claim to check\ntheir traps twice daily so that other\npredators cannot take the catch away.\nThey say that animals die quickly in\nthe Canadian Arctic conditions and\nthat the traps used now do not cause\nlesions as the arms are padded with\nrubber. They say that gin traps are not\nused and that all Lynx publicity is\nmisleading.\nThe Canadian Government have\nmanaged to persuade Greenpeace to\nhalt its campaigns against the fur\ntrade. They decided that, although the\nfur trade was very damaging to\nmillions of wild animals each year,\ntheir campaign was threatening the\nway of life of many native peoples.\nThis followed pleas by Indigenous\nSurvival International that 'the anti-seal and anti-wild fur campaigns\ndirectly or indirectly are condemning\nour people to a slow genocide of a culture that has cared since time\nimmemorial about lands and animals.'\nHowever, more and more traders\nare shunning wild pelts in favour of\nfarmed pelts which are thicker, larger\nand glossier.\nThe future?\nThe B FT A are not keen to admit it\nbut more and more fur firms are going\nunder as less and less furs are sold in\nthis country. However, the worldwide\nproduction has gone up by 10% this\nyear. Fur will still go on selling even\nif none of it is sold in Britain.\nThe B FT A are very sensitive to all\nthe bad press they have received. No animal in danger of extinction is sold\nas a fur coat in this country but they\ncannot deny that other countries'\ntraders may flout the law.\nMeanwhile Lynx supporters are\ngrowing in strength with their new\nChristmas campaign aimed at\nhighlighting 'greedy furriers making\nprofits out of pain'. Emotive words\nwhich seem to have been very\neffect he over the last few years but\nhow many British furriers are making\nhuge profits now?\nFELIX Wednesday 16th December 1987 21\n\n"

    "content": "Features Just messing about on\nthe river?\nIt was a cold, grey\nSunday morning in\nthe middle of\nNovember. The sky\nwas heavy and a cold wind was\nblowing up from\nthe Thames\nestuary. Imperial\nCollege Union Boat\nClub was setting\nout to practise for\nanother prestigious\nrace that was\ncoming up the\nfollowing weekend.\nAnd the heavens\nopened....\nThe Imperial College Union Boat\nClub has been one of the most\nsuccessful College clubs this year.\nThe highlight was their win at Henley\nover the summer, where the top squad\ntook the Visitors Cup. This was\nfollowed by a9 th placing at the World\nStudent Games, where C. Behrens,\nG. Pooley, J. Waller, J. Walker and\ncox I. Scutts represented Great Britain\nin the Men's Coxed Fours. But these\nare only two of the Club's successes:\nat this year's Club dinner it took\nCaptain Robert Gee nearly ten\nminutes to list the past year's achievements.\nThe Club has become well known\nto the rest of IC as a high-spending\nsociety which enjoys the patronage of\ncertain influential College officials.\nLast year the Club annoyed Union\nofficers by buying a secondhand eight\nfrom Oxford with the help of College\nAssistant Secretary Michael Arthur.\nThe Club had tried to persuade the\nUnion Finance Committee to buy the\nboat with money brought forward on\nits long term spending plan. When\nUFC decided that their claim could\nnot be rushed through, and would\nhave to be judged alongside claims\nfrom other Union clubs, the boat was\nbought with a loan from the College\naccount. Boat club later tried to\nrecoup the money from the Union.\n( UFC has agreed to pay the money\nthis year, when the boat was\noriginally due to be purchased).\nI was more interested in the Club\nitself rather than its financial\narguments with the Union, so I decided to go down to its Putney\nboat house to see for myself what the\nmembers did with their spare time.\nMy first trip was during the summer\nholidays, when Boathouse Manager\nand Club Coach Bill Mason was\nrepairing the boats and oars in\npreparation for the new academic\nyear. I was met by Bill and Robert\nGee, who gave me an extensive tour\nof the Boathouse. In the training pools\non top of the building new members\ncan get the feel of rowing and learn\nelementary techniques before being\nlet loose on the river. The top\nsquad der s also get to use the tanks\nwhenever there is fog on the river or\nwhen they want to study their own\ntechniques in mirrors. There are three\nold ergo meters by the side of the pool\nwhich strengthen muscles and help\nwith breathing. Robert explained that\ntime on these machines is very limited\nsince there are over 80 active\nmembers. He also expects the Club\nmembership to increase by 30 next\nyear when St Mary's merges with\nImperial, which will stretch the\nfacilities they have even more.\nAt first sight of the boat room, there\nseemed to be more boats than any\nrowing club could wish for, but on\ncloser inspection it was clear that\nmany were old or cannibal is ed. After\na boat has been raced a certain\nnumber of times it loses its speed.\nNew boats are always rigid which\nmakes them fast but with constant\nbattering this rigidity is lost and the\nboat becomes slower. This is a particular problem with the new\ncarbon fibre boats at the top end of\nthe range. These are used very rarely\nand the top class boats in the\nBoathouse are only used for\nprestigious races. A boat will also lose\nits speed when it has to be repaired\nwith plastic padding. It is essential\nthat the oarsmen have a top class boat\nfor racing otherwise they start losing\nrather than winning. Bill and Rob\nboth believe that there is no point in\nhaving the Club if it can't compete in\ntop level competitions. This is why\nthey jumped at the chance of\npurchasing the Oxford eight last year.\nNovices are started in the old boats\nafter they have completed their\ntraining in the tanks. After they have\nwon a certain number of races they\nare no longer considered to be novices\nand have to move up one class. The\nbetter the rower becomes the better\nthe boat the rower is allowed to train\nin. Most of the boats are wood. These\ntend to keep their rigidity for a longer\ntime than carbon fibre boats but are\nnot as quick. Bill described how\ndifficult it was to maintain the boat\n'heir achy'. If he allowed any team to\nuse a better boat than they were able\nto handle then the whole boat\npreservation thing would break down.\nThe boats in the Boathouse are not\nused exclusively by the Club. Some\nboats belong to private individuals\nand others are lean t out to other\ncollege's teams to use. It would be\nvery easy to say that the Club owns\ntoo many boats but each one has\nspecific use, whether it be for the\nRugby teams that row on Morphy\nDay or the top squad. Bill told me that\nfor some of the really top events they\nhad to hire or borrow another club's boat as the current boats aren't adequate.\nUpstairs in the Club lounge we\nlooked at the many cups in the trophy\ncabinet and talked further about the\nClub.'\nTalking to Bill it is easy to see why\nthe Club has been so successful. He\nis an incredibly dedicated coach who\nhas complete faith in his teams'\nabilities. He is very keen to stress that\nsuccess\" can only be brought about\nwith hard work. It is only the\nmembers who share Bill's enthusiasm\nand dedication for rowing that survive\nthe rig ours of Boat Club life. Bill has\nlittle tolerance for members who wish\nto row occasionally and makes it clear\nthat rowing time is too precious to be\nused up on joyrides.\nHe is convinced that the more\ntraining his top rowers do, the better\nthey perform in race situations.\nWe became so involved in Boat\nClub talk that it was three hours later\nthat I finally made my way back to\n18 Wednesday 16th December 1987 FELIX\n\n"

The final\nconsisted of two fifteen-minute halves\nrather than the twenty minute games\nplayed previously.

Everton are not playing their\nbest football at the moment, but with\nplayers like the hard working Peter\nReid and the sharp shooting Graeme\nSharp, it should be a superb game\nwith the result going any way.\nNearest tube: Arsenal.\nWest Ham Utd vs Newcastle Utd\n(Division 1)\nSaturday December 19, Upton Park\nA game between two sides in the\nmiddle of the league. West Ham, always re noun ed as an exciting,\nattacking side, had a bad start to the\nseason but under loyal manager John\nLyall and thrilling skills of Kevin\nKeen, Paul Ince and Tony Cottee,\nthings are improving. Newcastle are\nplaying some good football at the\nmoment with the Brazillian striker\nFrancisco Ernadi Lima da Silva\n(known as Mirandinha) and ex-Hammer Paul Goddard leading the\nway. West Ham should win with the\nclose atmosphere and skills proving\nthe clinching factors.\nNearest tube: Upton Park.\nFulham vs Chesterfield (Division 3)\nSaturday December 19,\nCraven Cottage\nA game not far away from Imperial\nat the riverside ground of Craven\nCottage. With Fulham near the top\nand Chesterfield near the bottom, plus\nthe sti king force of Gordon Davies\nand Leroy Rosenior, Fulham should\nwin comfortably.\nNearest tube: Putney Bridge.\nCharlton vs Chelsea (Division 1)\nSunday December 20, Selhurst Park\nA London Derby between stu gg ling Charlton and top half Chelsea.\nCharlton, the side that only scraped\nback into the First Division by means\nof the play-offs are having a wretched\nseason, despite Welsh International\nAndy Jones and ex-Spurs player\nGarth Crooks. Chelsea, under John\nHollins are a good working side with\nexciting Scot Pat Nevin and ex-England striker Kerry Dixon. Chelsea, who gave Liverpool a good\nrun for their money two weeks ago,\nshould grab the 3 points.\nNearest station: Norwood Junction\n(BR).\nSo go along to see some good football\nthis weekend before Christmas and\nignore the talk of hooliganism, it is\nvery rare and only for those who want\nit.\nAdrian Grainger\nFELIX\nWednesday 16th December 1987\nCROSSCOUNTRY Led from behind\n\n"

Buzzzzzzzzzzz\nDear Judith,\nHere's something apolitical etc. I quite often use the\nLyon-Playfair Library (LPL). When I go there I expect\na quiet atmosphere and that's usually what libraries try\nto maintain because it's helpful for studying, reading etc.\nNo, I'm not going to complain about student rioting in\nthe LP L but the silent hammering of the fluorescent\nlighting circuits on my brain. The beat is too fast (3000\ncrotchets/minute) to be useful (eg hum along with). I don't know how many other people find this unpleasant but I do and if I am not alone in this perhaps LP L would do\nsomething about it. Do LP L hear me?\nYourssssssss,\nNeil Boxall (Elec Eng).\nObjectionable\nDear Judith,\nI write to protest about the objectionable tactics used,\nby members of the Jewish Society in the last U GM, to\ndivert attention from a motion put forward by members\nof the Friends of Palestine Society. The purpose of the\nmotion was to bring attention to an incident which took\nplace during a student protest in Bethlehem University.\nThe university is located in lands under Israeli military\noccupation since 1967. During the protest, a student was\nshot dead, in the head, by the Israeli army. A sniper rifle\nwas used. Before we could find what students of this\nCollege think, before they were even informed about the\nmotion, a member of the Jewish Society put forward a large number of what I can only describe as ridiculous\nam mend ment s. The purpose was not to clarify but to\nconfuse. Before further discussion was allowed, a procedural motion was brought forward to delay the\ndiscussion until after the reports. This was against a previous motion which put the motions first. At this point,\nthe very same members of the Jewish Society who later\nclaimed that they wanted the incident d is us sed and the truth\ntold to our students, voted to delay the discussion! My belief that they only wanted to keep the incident under\ncover was further confirmed when the Chairperson of the\nJewish Society refused to sign a paper that called for an\nEG M to discuss the motion.\nI understand their position. They wrongly believe that\nsupporting Israel, right or wrong, protects the State and\nis for the good of the Jewish people. I disagree. I would\nvote for any motion which objects to human rights\nviolations in my country, because, in the long run, it is\nfor my country's own good. The delicate situation in the\nMiddle East can only be resolved if peace prevails and\nthis cannot be achieved as long as human rights are being\nviolated. They should help by informing people of the\nfacts, not by putting the lid on the whole affair. The build\nup of pressure only leads to an explosion.\nAs for the false claim that the motion attacks Jews I can only wonder, if protesting to the shooting of a student\nthrough the head by an Israeli sniper is an attack on Jews,\nhow can the mother of the dead student protest? Would\nthey consider a polite letter to an Israeli army officer,\nbegging to spare the rest of her children, more appropriate?\nIf you think so, try to convince her!\nj Yours sincerely,\n' Amin El-Kholy (DOC 2).\n' PS. Apathy played an important role, people decided that\n| the motion was actually irrelevant before they could find\nout what it was all about!\nSurvival at IC\nDear Judith,\nSome months ago, several women postgraduates from\nImperial College attended a meeting entitled 'How to\nSurvive a PhD', run by a group called 'Women for Science\nfor Women' in Holborn. We would now like to suggest\na get-together for a drink and a chat here at IC.

Rob was bought by the IC Union Office\nat the City & Guilds Slave Auction last month for \u00a321.\nYesterday he was made to dress up as a fairy, chair a meeting\nof the Athletics Clubs Committee and collect for Rag. He\nmade the Union \u00a335.21 for their Rag total. Rob said that\nhe didn't 'come cheap'. Neil McCluskey, Recreational Clubs\nCommittee Chairman said later he looked 'even cuter than\nusual'.\nINI ews Staff bitter over fine\nNick Marchant, a mines student, has\nbeen fined \u00a325 by the College\nDisciplinary Committee and \u00a315 by\nthe Royal School of Mines Union for\nbreaking a glass over the head of\nUnion Bar Manager Adrian Johnson\nlast month. He will also be banned\nfrom College bars for one year.\nThe incident occured during a Mines bar night on November 4th. Mr Johnson was badly cut and had blood\n'pouring out' from the back of his\nhead but it healed without stitches. It\nwas decided by Mr Johnson and\nMines President Geoff Parsons that\nthe police would not be called for at\nthat time.\nAfter the fine was announced both\nUnion President Ian Howgate and\nUnion bar staff condemned it as\ntrifling and not harsh enough for the\ncrime that was committed. The\nregular Wednesday casual bar staff\nhave announced that they are not\nwilling to work in the bar for the next\nMines bar night which takes place\ntonight because they did not feel there\nwas adequate protection as the fine\nwas too small to be a deterrent. Mr Howgate said yesterday that if no staff\ncould be found to help Mr Johnson\nand his assistant Peter Hartley then he\nwould be forced to close the Bar this\nevening.\nMr Johnson said yesterday that he\n'regrets the fact that the bar will not\nbe open but he can see no way round\nthe current situation'.\nParty\nviolence\nThe Falmouth-Keogh Hall Christmas\nParty held last Saturday in the Union\nBuilding was marred by violence\nfrom a gate-cras her. Subwardens\nattempted to keep out people who\nwere not from Falmouth-Keogh and\nhadn't paid.

Two of the students\nappealed against a fine and reprimand\nissued by the warden of Holbein\nHouse.\nVerdicts about their cases have\nbeen reached but they have yet to be\ninformed in writing.\nTwo disciplinary hearings were\nadjourned until next term, in order to\nallow time for further statements and\ninformation to be received.\nAssault 2\nAn assault in which a member of\nj Dram soc was all edged to have hit\n(someone over the head with a bottle\nin the table tennis room of the Union\nBuilding last Friday evening at about\n10 o 'clock. The Dramsoc person was,\nwearing a Greek costume at the time\nthe incident happened as he had just\ncome off stage mid-way through the\nproduction of The Flies and it has\nbeen suggested that an unflattering\ncomment was passed about this.\nBeit Security were contacted and\nthe police were phoned at 10.05pm at the in sistance of the 'victim'. Two policemen arrived and agreed to wait\nuntil the all edged attacker came off\nstage before they had a 'word' with\nhim. Charges of actual bodily harm\nand malicious wounding will appear\nnext month.\nThe President of Dramsoc gave the\nfollowing statement 'we extend\nsympathies to the victim of the attack\nand condemn it as dangerous and\nirresponsible'.\nChampions\nIC Water Polo team have won the\nSouth of England U AU Championships after playing Surrey\n(4-3), Bristol (9-3), Bath (6-1) and\nSouthampton (4-4).

Everything was\nso familiar, but with Pakistan such an\nintense, recent experience in our\nminds, London seemed like a dream.\nI don't mind adf n it ting finding seventy\nmiles per hour on the M4 quite\nfrightening for a while.\nThe expedition was conceived,\nplanned and executed by ourselves,\nnine IC undergraduates and a Cambridge postgraduate, with advice\nand help from the Royal Geographical\nSociety and the Imperial College\nExploration Board. Along with a number of industrial sponsors, they\nhelped fund us, though we spent\nseveral hundred pounds each\nourselves. The message is that all you\nneed is the desire to do something and\nthe willingness to work hard for it.\nThe experience will be worthwhile,\nas I expect members of the several\nCollege expeditions of last year would\nagree.\nTrying to express the highlights of a ten-week, ten-person expedition is\nhard enough when you are talking to\npeople\u2014in the space available here all\nI can do is offer some of my strongest\nimpressions.\nThe people were almost without\nexception friendly and cooperative \u2014the only exceptions being\nin business matters such as perks for\nthe porters or the jeep driver who\nrefused to take us all the way back to\nSkardu because the police there\nwanted him for gun-running. We taught them football during rests on\nthe walk-in\u2014and began to regret it as\ntheir enthusiasm far exceeded our\navailable energy and our ability to\nrepair the beach ball we were using.\nWe watched the moon rise from our\nadvanced base camp, several miles\naway and higher up than our main\ncamp. It began at dusk as a pale\nsilvery glow running along the tops\nof the snow-plastered Meru group, a glow which expanded and brightened,\nwashing out the stars all round. Then\nthe first sliver of moon appeared, an\nastonishingly bright splinter\u2014as\nthough someone had lifted the curtain\nof the night sky up from the grey\nmountain silhouette to reveal a cold\nsilvery sunlight beyond. As it rose it\nwas as though the area had been\nfloodlit. Sharp shadows lay\neverywhere and the ice and snow on\nthe mountains and glaciers around us\ngleamed as thousands of little shards\nof ice reflected moonlight at us; this\nsuperimposed on the general\nfluorescent appearance of the moonlit\nsnow. Just as the sky is much blacker\nand the stars sharper, the moonlight\nseems ten times as intense as in\nBritain\u2014we could hardly look at it.\nWe watched the meteor showers in\nawe, lying in our sleeping bags, heads\nout of the tent, wondering when the\nnext one would flash by.\nSome of us met a bear, which\nimmediately ran off (and considering\nour appearance after a few weeks, I'm not surprised). A lone eagle\noccasionally soared over the area and\na particularly cheeky ibex chewed up\nthe inner of a tent we'd been using up\nthe hill by base camp as a marker!\n(Sorry, Exploration Board.)\nWe flew out from Skardu in a Fokker Friendship\u2014a plane of limited\ncruising altitude which meant we had\nan astonishing flight, threading our\nway along gorges and around\nmountains, sometimes only a couple\nof hundred feet from a rock face\ntowering over us. We were treated to\nsights of yet more famous and\nmagnificent mountains, the early\nmorning lighting lending a magical air\nof unreality to the whole thing. After\nseven weeks on foot suddenly we\nwere soaring over villages and\nvalleys, the cultivation terraces picked\nout by the low sun. Never have I found flight more exciting.\nPossibly the best feeling of all\n(apart f om getting back to Britain)\nwas sitting on top of a peak, knowing\nthat almost certainly no-one had ever\nbeen there before, eating a few raisins\nor a Crunchy bar. It would usually be\njust after sunrise (we climbed in the\nvery early morning while the snow\nwas still frozen\u2014allowing us to\nascend even 70-80\" slopes using ice\naxes and cramp on s) and we would\nsurvey our half-familiar area from a new vantage-point, seeing distant\nbehemoths lighting up in the first\nsunlight, watching the pinks and\nyellows of dawn rush down the\nmountains and ridges as the sun rose.\nSharp, deep shadows picked out the\ntextures in rocky mountainsides,\nsmooth rounded ones the snow,\ni moulded to the underlying rock. As the sun rose, illumination became\nmore even and the texture faded\naway, the details dissolving into the\nbulk of the mountains, distant ridges\nbecoming indistinguishable from the\nbackground. Then, with the show\nover, we'd head down.\nPossibly the worst feeling was\nbeing horribly unwell in Islamabad,\nin an 'air-conditioned' hotel room at\n30\u00b0 C, too weak to walk\u2014but I was\nunlucky in that, most people escaped\nit.\nA Fazakerley (Space Physics PG)\nEXPLORATION BOARD Going places\nHave you ever wanted to travel to\nexotic parts of the world, to\ninvestigate foreign cultures, explore\nuncharted regions, to boldly go where\nnot IC student has gone before,\netc.. .but have never had the necessary\nmoney or perhaps companions for\nyour venture?\nWell, have no fear, Imperial\nCollege's Exploration Board is here!\nThe Exploration Board, funded by\nImperial College, ICU and various\nother organisations, provides financial\nsupport to expeditions organised by\nIC students, which it has approved.\nThe Board do not ' run' expeditions\u2014it is entirely up to the\nstudents concerned to set up and run\nan expedition. Rather the Board meets\nsome (usually not all) of the\nexpedition costs, loans some\nexpedition equipment and provides\ninsurance for expedition members and\nequipment. The Board also gives\nexpeditions official status as an\nImperial College venture\u2014useful\nwhen dealing with potential sponsors\nand foreign governments.\nSo how do you get these goodies?\nWell, once you have formed a reasonably detailed plan and a rough\nteam you should contact either the\nChairman Dr RC Schroter of Aero\nEng or the Hon Sec Mr DMC Adlington at 15 Princes Gardens. It\nwould be helpful if you could also\ncontact a student representative:\nPatrick Coleman (RSMU)\nIna El-Khadi (RCSU)\nDavid Grimshaw (ICU)\nRichard Hardiman ( C& GU) This should be done as soon as\npossible, so that it can be discussed\nat the last Board Meeting for this\nacademic year on Wednesday\nFebruary 3.\nYou don't have to be an Indiana\nJones or even a member of an\n'adventurous' club (like Scout and\nGuide or Sub-Aqua) to go on an\nexpedition\u2014although any relevant\nskills would be helpful. The Why, Where and When are entirely up to\nyou, although it should have a reasonable purpose (getting a suntan\nor getting stoned on foreign booze are\nnot reasonable) and the expedition\nmembers should be good\nambassadors for Imperial College.\nRecent expeditions include an\nornithological trip to the Cameroons,\nmonitoring pollution levels\nunderwater along the Sinai Peninsula\nand Mount McKinley in Canada.\nSo c 'mon, get off your butt and into\na wide world ripe for exploring!\nFELIX Wednesday 16th December 1987 25\n\n"

    "content": "Meeting on Thursday and are\nconfident that their motion will now\nbe fully debated.\nThe outcome, as always, will\ndepend on the number of interested\nparties who turn up to vote.\nThe Constituent College Unions\nhave had their fair share of ups and\ndowns this term. The Mines image\nhad definately been on an upper since\nGeoff Parsons took control. He\nmanaged to persuade several\ncompanies to give him money to refit\nthe Mines Coffee Room as a new\noffice. Poor old Royal College of\nScience Union discovered the full\nextent of their debts to College. They\nhad to find some way of paying back\naround \u00a36000. But their troubles\ndon't even compare to City &\nGuild's. They have had to contend\nwith Dave Tyler as President. The\npoor boy has delusions of grandeur\nand doesn't see what's wrong with\nthreatening STOIC, fl anning those\nwho do not wish to be flan ned and\nstealing 3000 copies of FELIX from\ntheir distribution points. Ah, well, I suppose it did raise an awful lot of\nmoney for Rag...Only one good thing\nhas happened to C&G Union. The\nvoters got it right and elected Tanya\nMaule, a first year chemical\nengineering student as new Vice\nPresident. Mr Tyler also managed to\nbring back the nastier side of inter-C CU rivalry when the C&G mascot ry team tried to kidnap RCS U's mascot,\na large thermometer called Theta. He\nwas so miffed that R CSU got away\nwhile he was trying to count them that\n\"The best thing to happen to Guilds\"\nhe incited Guilds members to ruin two\nR CSU fresher s dinners.\nIt may have seemed that Ian\nHowgate was an utter dick head from\nearly reports in FELIX but in\ncomparison to Dave Tyler he is\ndelightful. Reports from the Union\nOffice are that Ian's doing a good job\nWell, at least one person was glad to see Howgate come back from Surrey\nnow and is a conscientious worker.\nShame about the Hon Sec, though.\nThere have been other notable\nevents this term. It was at the end of\nOctober that 'heroic' Steve Pearson\nof the ICU Boat Club rescued an\nelderly woman from drowning in the\nRiver Thames. The woman had been\nfound in the water near Fulham\nfootball ground. It was believed that\nshe was trying to commit suicide. The\nincident had occurred while members\nof the Club were practising in cox less fours. When Steve noticed her he\ndived from the boat and pulled the\nwoman to the riverbank with another\noarsman, Vince Roper. Steve gave\nthe woman mouth-to-mouth\nresuscitation while blankets were\nbrought and an ambulance was called.\nThe new Imperial School of\nManagement was also born amidst\npetty politic ing and outrage from the\nUnion's music societies when they\nheard that they would lose their music\nroom in 53 Princes Gate. This led to\na petition being presented to the\nRector and a protest carol concert\nbeing given yesterday. The Union,\ninitially confident that the room would\nbe safe, have since started looking for\nalternatives.\nCollege administration has had its\nshare of shake ups. Over summer,\nLesley Gillingham was removed as\nStudent Accommodation Officer,\nafter complaints from several\nwardens. Managing Surveyor Peter\nHallworth said that letters had been\nsent out late and that staff morale had\nbeen low. He said his decision to\nremove Ms Gillingham had been a hard one to make but that it had\n'proved to be the right one'. Hapless\nMichael Arthur, College Assistant\nSecretary, took control until his\ngirlfriend Anna Jones could take over.\nIt was during this time that College\nhad to face a massive clear up in\nHamlet Gardens after residents had\nwrecked the flats over the summer.\nOne group had even sold all the\nfurniture from their flat. All the\nblankets had to be dry cleaned twice\nand Manager Mark Cottle said 'if we\nhadn't been there, there wouldn't be\nany buildings left!'\nThe College housing situation has\nlooked glum for next year. It was\nrevealed that at least 50 more places\nwill be lost overall even though 180\nplaces have been gained in Evelyn\nGardens. Housing benefit is also to\nbe cut in April 1988.\nDespite all this doom, gloom and\ndepression things have been going\nwell for other spheres of the Union.\nRag looks like breaking all records\nthis year under the leadership of Nigel\nBaker. The total now is almost as\nmuch as was raised the whole of last\nyear. Rag Week went well with the\nexception of drink-a pub-dry. London\nStudent reported that 'Imperial louts'\nhad gone on a drunken rampage\nthrough the University of London\nUnion Building, stealing signs and\ngenerally being offensive. This news\nstory was very reminiscent of the one\nFELIX had carried earlier in the term,\nreporting that IC sports team had been\naccused of sexism, racism and\n'riotous behaviour' while visiting\nSurrey University. The whole\nincident was resolved when Surrey\n'kidnapped' Ian Howgate and gave\nhim a haircut. We were told that\nSurrey now realise why Imperial\nmales acted in such a fashion after\nhaving to listen to non-stop Ian for\nthree days. It has to be noted that a collection was held in December'sU GM. One tin, collecting to bring Ian\nback, raised around \u00a35. The other tin,\nNews collecting to ask Surrey to keep him,\nraised \u00a330. Unfortunately this was\nnowhere near the \u00a3100 Surrey was\nasking for so they sent him back.\nThe final major news story was that\nthe infamous French con man has\nstarted operating in College again. He\nhas been conning foreign students for\nover three years now. He always\nclaims to have lost all his money\ngambling and that he needs to get\nhome urgently. He offers expensive\nlooking jewellery as security and\ntakes sums of around \u00a31000 from\nunsuspecting students.\nThe triumph of this term this year\nhas been College Entertainments who\nfinally seem to have a competent\nChairman and the 'right attitude'. We\nsaw 'Voice of the Beehive' perform\nin Freshers Week who have since\nmade the charts with T Say Nothing'.\nThey also managed to get 'The Real\nSounds of Africa' who had been\nfeatured on The South Bank Show\nonly a week earlier. This has given\nthe committee a problem; they have\ntoo much money left!\nThis term has also been the term of\nthe condom. Did you spot the packet\non the picture cover? Not only did\nFELLX shock its readers by revealing\nhow to put on a condom but the Union\nOffice, Snack Bar and Bar also started\nselling Mates.\nFinally, a little FELIX anecdote. In\nour Freshers Issue we carried a spoof\narticle about Prof E Verreday who\nhad invented AC batteries. This got\nthe trade press so excited that\nElectronic Times rang College up to\nget more details on the project!\nHappy Christmas from us all.\nNEWS REVIEW FELIX Wednesday 16th December 1987 7\n\n"
