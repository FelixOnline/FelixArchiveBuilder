The co-ed shows\nwere also entertaining; men and women in suits presented powerful and subtle dance moves, presenting a unified\nfeeling of being within the professional\nworld. Furthermore, models in casual-wear painted a romantic picture of dating and youthfulness, highlighted by\nmen kneeling and gifting their counterparts with roses. The men in Swimwear\nand Mixed Athleisure greatly enjoyed\nshowing off their physiques, lifting girls\nto the sound of \u2018Can\u2019t Touch This\u2019 by MC\nHammer. The most anticipated category,\nBoys in Heels, did not disappoint, with\nflawless struts down the catwalk making\nthe crowd cheer loudly for their peers\nthat were, perhaps for the first time in\ntheir lives, walking on elevated shoes.\nIC Dance and Intermission\nTo give all the performers a little break,\nthe audience was blessed by an epic\nperformance by an all-female IC Dance\ngroup. With more refined structure\nand skill, I was amazed by their smooth\ntransitions and group aura, performing\nto songs the audience could sing their\nhearts out to: \u2018Bad Romance\u2019, \u2018Poker Face\u2019,\n\u2018Run the World (Girls)\u2019, and \u2018Candy Shop\u2019.\nThe intermission left no time for silence or boredom. With an impressive\nensemble and conductor, IC Jazz Band\nperformed with a selection of live sing-ers, who showed off their vocal talent and\nability to control the crowd \u2013 an essential\nelement to any musical performance.\nAt a ticket price of \u00a315, the show was a\nfun night out with friends, and I recommend attending, or even participating,\nin next years show. It is not only open\nto our future doctors, but engineers and\nscientists too.\n\n"

This is a bit of a clich\u00e9, but it is indeed true that there\nare no two homes alike. It is also intriguing that siblings may not have the same\nidea of home, yet people from opposite\nends of the world might share some of\nthe same memories and a common nostalgia for some oddly specific aspect of\ntheir childhood.\nIn the last couple of weeks I\u2019ve been\nthinking a lot about home. Now, having\nspent almost two years in a country different from the one I grew up in, I have\nbecome somewhat disillusioned with the\nidea of moving abroad to study. I\u2019ve come\nto realise that home simply means being\naround the people I love. And this feeling goes hand in hand with our sensory\nperception of home, which is completely subjective. For example, I distinctly remember waking up on a Saturday\nmorning and hearing the sound of small\nspoons hitting two or three mugs, and\nthe unmistakable smell of warm milk for\nbreakfast. Even if I tried to recreate that\nfeeling here and now, I\u2019d fail miserably, as\nit\u2019s not just the physical sensations that\nare missing but the feeling of home associated with them.\nSome senses are more suited than others to evoke such feelings, as in the title\nof this article. I think the greatest advantage of our sense of smell is that it aids\nmemory better than anything else. Often\nall you need is a whiff of some long-for-gotten scent to remember days\u2019 worth\nof memories and feelings. This week\u2019s\ntheme is exactly what I\u2019ve just chaotically described: a jumbled mess of nostalgia\nand perception, an unsolvable equation\nof smell and home.\nBut we are photographers, and what a\nwonderful challenge it is trying to photograph a smell. By definition, it cannot\nbe accomplished simply using your eyes,\nso how do you tackle it? We can find a\nworkaround to this by capturing an image that evokes a distinct scent, instantly jogging the memory as we discussed.\nClose your eyes for a moment \u2013 how hard\nis it to smell something just by thinking\nabout it?\nThe Climb immediately hits you with\nvibrant, loud colours, and then ever so\nsubtly envelopes you with very distinct\nsmells. Wet foliage, humidity, and spray\nfrom the waterfall, your sweat from walking up all those stairs, fresh air piercing\nthrough your body. These smells evoke\nnostalgia in Jia, who uses this image\nto tell a story, telling us about her life,\nabout her childhood. That\u2019s what is special about \u2018Smells like home\u2019: it\u2019s such\na personal and subjective theme that it\nfeels like I\u2019m peeking into someone else\u2019s\nmemory. Let me also appreciate the technical skill displayed in The Climb: dramatic dark greens worthy of National Geographic, framing bright colours that can\nlighten your mood. The wonderfully executed vertical composition and professional editing contribute to what could\nnaively be seen as a \u2018poster photo\u2019, while\nin reality this hides a profound, almost\nreligious quality.\nUnfortunately for all other Imperial College photography enthusiasts,\nthis will be the last photo competition\ntheme of this academic year. Thank you\nto everyone who participated \u2013 it was a\npleasure and a privilege to be able to look\nat and judge your very best pictures. I\nlook forward to beginning a new series of\n\u2018Photo of the Week\u2019 in October 2024!\nSmells like home\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nA sensory trip down nostalgia lane\nThe Climb Jia Yang Lee\n\n"

The College is now the highest-ranking university in both the UK and\nEurope.\nRising from sixth place in the 2024\nrankings, Imperial has overtaken both\nOxford, which has remained in third\nplace, and Cambridge, which fell from\nsecond to fifth place this year. This is\nthe first time in a decade that Imperial\nhas ranked ahead of its Oxbridge peers.\nMIT remains the best university globally,\nmaintaining its position for the 13th year\nin a row.\nImperial was ranked 22nd\nfor academic\nreputation, 11th\nglobally for employer\nreputation, and sixth globally for\nsustainability practices. Earlier this year,\nit announced the Imperial Zero Index,\na framework that will be used to screen\ninvestments and research partners.\nResponding to the achievement,\nImperial College President Professor\nHugh Brady said: \u201cImperial\u2019s ranking\nis a testament to the quality and\ncommitment of our entire community.\nIt is inspiring to see our students, staff,\nand partners come together every day\nto interrogate the forces that shape our\nworld and address the challenges facing\nhumanity and our planet.\u201d\nDespite Imperial\u2019s success, 58% of UK\nuniversities have fallen in the table as\nfundingwoesbegintohit. Researchbythe\nOffice for Students indicates that 40% of\nUK universities could face budget deficits\nthis year, and government pressure to\nreduce net migration is expected to\ndrive a decline in international student\nnumbers.\nA total of 90 universities from the\nUK make the QS league table, making it\nthe second-most represented location\nbehind the United States. 15 British\ninstitutions rank within the top 100, two\nfewer than in last year\u2019s table.\nImperial second in world university rankings\nCollege tops\nUK and Europe\nahead of\nOxbridge peers\nin QS World\nUniversity\nRankings 2025.\nNewsWriter\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nThomas Angus for Imperial College London\nmost senior staff work.\nFor the first time, protesters named\nPresident Hugh Brady and Provost Ian\nWalmsley in their chants, shouting \u201cHugh\nBrady, shame on you\u201d and \u201cIan Walmsley,\nshame on you\u201d.\nOne speaker at the rally had a message\nfor Brady and Walmsley, the two most\nsenior leaders at the College.\n\u201cWhenyougohometoyourbigmansion\nand your six-figure salary, do you hear the\nscreams of children [in Gaza] at night?\u201d he\nasked through a megaphone.\nAt 5:30pm, an hour after the\nencampment\u2019s final event of the day,\nImperial sent its response. University\nSecretary Richard Martin and Vice-Provost\nPeter Haynes said that they recognised \u201cthe\nprofound human suffering\u201d caused by the\nwar in Gaza.\nThe university rejected activists\u2019 calls for\nImperial to condemn Israel\u2019s actions in the\nGaza Strip, saying it would undermine the\nCollege\u2019s ability to provide \u201can open forum\nfor debate an exploration of all topics.\u201d\nProtestors have sent the university the\nnames of companies they want it to divest\nfrom and cut research \u2013 because of alleged\ncomplicity in \u2018crimes against Palestinians\u2019.\nImperial responded to the divestment\ndemand saying that all its investments\nare made in accordance with its Socially\nResponsible Investment Policy, which\nmakes it a \u201csignatory to the UN Principles\nof Responsible Investment\u201d. It did not\ncomment further.\nThe university said its research\nrelationships are governed by its\nRelationships Policy, legislative\nrequirements, and the provisions of the\nNational Security & Investment Act 2021.\nThe Relationships Policy compels\n\u2018individual members of the College\ncommunity\u2019 to abide by its guidelines\n\u2018when forming relationships with third\nparties,\u2019 and charges them with \u2018escalating\nmatters where appropriate\u2019.\nAn encampment representative said:\n\u201cOur position [is that Imperial] has moral\nresponsibilities beyond the minimum\nrequired by law.\n\u201cThey have an existing relationships\npolicy which mentions the role of\nindividual academics to assess the ethical\nand moral implications of their work. It\u2019s\nour belief that the College should do that\ninstitutionally as well.\n\u201c[Some of] the companies that we have\nidentified in our report are companies that\nare specifically listed by the United Nations\nHigh Commission as operating illegally in\nthe occupied territories [of Palestine].\nAddressing Imperial\u2019s investment policy,\nthe representative said: \u201cAny \u2018socially\nresponsible investment\u2019 policy is not\nworth its name if it enables investment\nin companies complicit in what these\ncompanies are doing.\u201d\nTheactivistshavealsocalledforImperial\nto \u2018support Palestinian students through\nscholarships, establishing links with\nPalestinian universities and supporting the\nrebuilding of the Gazan higher education\nsystem.\u2019\nIn its response to the activists\u2019 demands,\nImperial highlighted its work with the\nCampaign for At Risk Academics (CARA).\nIn May, the College announced it would\nfund and host eight CARA fellows \u2013 at risk\nin their home countries \u2013 to complete two-year research placements at the College.\nThe encampment representatives said\nthat the CARA programme did not meet\ntheir specifications. \u201cIt\u2019s our opinion\nthat Imperial\u2019s responsibility \u2013 given its\nrelationships with these companies who\nare complicit in what\u2019s going on in Gaza\nright now \u2013 goes beyond temporarily\nexporting Palestinian academics from\nGaza.\n\u201cThe minimum we would ask for is that\nthey set money aside to be ready to help\nwhen the conflict ends to help rebuild\nthe indigenous Palestinian academic\nenvironment.\n\u201cImperial\u2019sresponseisabsolvingthemof\nany moral duty by simply pointing to laws\nor acts that they have in place.

Students from\nthe maths, chemistry, life sciences, and physics departments team up and find low-cost solutions to a global\nchallenge. The teams pitch their idea to a panel for the\nchance to secure funding and lab space to test their idea\nfor commercial potential over eight weeks. Here, FoNSMAD alumni Chan Li, Hongyang Zhu, and Ruchita Duva\nspeak with Felix about their idea to manufacture a biodegradable plastic alternative made from crustacean\nshells and crop weeds.\nHow did you manufacture this plastic,\nstarting from the raw materials?\nZhu: We bought some crabs from Billingsgate Market\nand ground it up, and treated it with a very strong acid\nand alkali solution. Then, we tried to combine chitin with\nlignin, but the combination didn\u2019t work well. So we asked\nour supervisor and she advised us to convert the chitin to\nchitosan. In this process, we treated chitin [a substance\nfound in the exoskeletons of anthropods] with very concentrated sodium hydroxide so that we were able to remove the acetyl groups and form chitosan.\nDuva: For our lignin extraction, we wanted to use crop\nweeds, so we went to Hyde Park and found weeds, dried\nit, and heated it in a round-bottom flask. We treated it\nwith an acid and alkali solution, and let it boil until it\nwas a dark-brown solution. Then we filtered it and did a\ncentrifuge to separate out the lignin powder.\nLi: Then we combined the chitosan and lignin powder in a petri dish using an acetic acid solvent. We explored different proportions of chitosan to lignin \u2013 so\nwe started off with just chitosan, which forms a clear\nplastic film, but it wasn\u2019t very waterproof. So we tried to\nimprove the water resistance of the film by adding up\nto 50% lignin. By the time you get to 50%, it felt like a\nbit of wood \u2013 the bioplastic was thick, and had a slightly\ncrispy and brittle texture. The optimal proportion was\naround 20 to 30% lignin in terms of flexibility. We also\ntried adding some other modifications to our bioplastic\n\u2013 we tried adding beeswax to make it more waterproof,\nwhich worked quite well. We also tried honey, but the\nbioplastic film just became very sticky and difficult to\npeel off. which just turned out to be a really sticky mess.\nWe spent quite a few days in the mechanical engineering lab testing out the strength of the plastics. We\nwould cut out little strips of plastic and clamp it onto\nthe machine and pull it apart to see how much force we\nneeded to apply in order to break the plastic much stress\nthere was.\nOther people have come up with this\ncombination of lignin and chitosan for\ndifferent uses. What makes your particular version of it special?\nLi: It has to do with where we\u2019re sourcing our materials\nfrom. For chitosan, we\u2019re sourcing it from invasive crus-taceans, or seafood waste. Ruchita came up with the idea\nfor sourcing lignin \u2013 she mentioned that farms in India\nburn weeds and that releases a lot of carbon dioxide. By\nincorporating the weeds into our product, it prevents the\nweeds from being burned and emitting carbon dioxide.\nWhat were your main takeaways from\nthe competition?\nDuva: What attracted to FoNS-MAD is its originality\n\u2013 it was an amazing way of bringing out the creativity\nin all of us. It\u2019s also about carrying the responsibility to\ntake on the whole project and having the independence\nto make decisions. When you have that independence,\nit also comes with problems \u2013 I never did a risk assessment before FoNS-MAD. We also expanded our network\n\u2013 tutors, people who helped us, group members \u2013 with\nwhom we had fun and serious moments working to-gether. I think it\u2019s very important to know how people\ncan help you in so many different ways. I think that\u2019s a\ngood lesson I learned: if you want help, just ask for it.\nZhu: We learned to use equipment that we wouldn\u2019t\nhave in labs that are part of our degrees \u2013 for example\nnuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to test purity. I just spoke to some\nPhD students and they said only PhD students are usually able to access those machines. If we hadn\u2019t done the\nFoNS-MAD lab placements, we wouldn\u2019t even have had\nthe opportunity to see the machines.\nWhat does the future hold for Licaze?\nLi: What inspired me when I went to the final events\nof previous FoNS-MaD competitions was that there\nwere people that took their idea further to build start-up\ncompanies. They managed to secure so much funding,\nwhich was amazing \u2013 and ideally I\u2019d like to do the same\nwith Licaze. But we\u2019re all quite busy in second year at\nthe moment, so we\u2019ve left it there for now. We really\nneed more lab time \u2013 the eight weeks of lab placement\nthat we had only allowed some initial research and test-ing, and there are still many problems we hope to solve.\nFor example, how do we make this small plastic sample\ninto an actual packaging product?\nZhu: There was another thing that we called the\n\u2018mystery product\u2019. During the extraction process, we accidentally made a waste product that created a very flexible and strong film, but we couldn\u2019t figure out what the\ncompound in it was. So we need time to figure that out,\nbut we\u2019re very busy.\nDuva: There were resources that we didn\u2019t have access to, like electron microscopes to take photos of the\nsurface of the plastic to understand the structural properties of it. So if we had opportunities to give us better\nequipment to do that, then that would be perfect.\nTeam Licaze with their bioplastic product Imperial College London\nX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVI\n\n"

Bottled water, fruit\njuices, olive oil, bananas, chewing gum,\nhandwash, and cutlery sit crowded onto\ntwo tables, and an assortment of pots and\nplates is stacked nearby. Underneath one of\nthe tables, a plastic storage unit is filled to\nthe brim with canned food and pasta.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had huge donations of food,\u201d\nsays George (not his real name), a student\nwho has been a part of the pro-Palestinian\nmovement at Imperial since October.\n\u201cEspecially things like snacks \u2013 there\u2019s\nalways, always snacks for people to eat.\u201d\nWe are sat at the edge of the\nencampment, next to the paved pathway\nthatcutsdiagonallythroughQueen\u2019sLawn.\nIn the time since the encampment\u2019s\nestablishment, the number of tents has\nmore than doubled, from 10 on 23rd\nMay to\nover 20 on 3rd\nJune.\nGeorge says that the increase is due to\ndemand from students who have passed by\nand expressed an interest in joining.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the most surprising thing,\nwe\u2019ve had to pick up seven or eight new\ntents,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cAt Imperial, you often feel that there\u2019s\na culture of apathy to what goes on in the\nworld politically. Even recently, when we\u2019ve\ndone rallies, it\u2019s been hard to connect with\nother people who care just because of how\nlittle time they seemed to have.\n\u201cBut when we sit here, especially at\nlunchtime, people walk by and every 20 to\n30 minutes, someone drops by to express\nsupport. People who I\u2019ve never seen before\ncare deeply about this and come out of the\nwoodwork because we\u2019re here all the time.\u201d\nThe encampment\u2019s Instagram\naccount, which first posted on 23rd\nMay, is\napproaching 1,000 followers at the time\nof writing. A GoFundMe created to solicit\ndonations for food and camping supplies\nhas raised over \u00a33,000; \u00a31,000 came from\na single anonymous donor.\nGeorge says that being involved in\nthe movement has been a big source\nof motivation \u201cin all areas of my life\u201d,\nincluding work. \u201cWhatever I do, whether\nit\u2019s research, academia, or another job, this\nmovement has made me think: What\u2019s the\nendresult?What\u2019stheoutcomeofthework\nthat I do?\n\u201cPart of the reason we raise these\ndemands is because there are ways to use\nscience and what we learn at Imperial that\ndon\u2019t involve ending lives at an industrial\nscale. Of course my involvement takes up\ntime, but it makes me feel more connected\nto the world and gives me energy that I\nnever had \u2013 it\u2019s rewarding.\u201d\nHedisputesaclaimmadebyamemberof\nImperial\u2019ssecuritystaff,whosaidthatwhile\nmany tents were pitched, only around five\npeople were present at the encampment\novernight.\n\u201cWe saw that and we genuinely don\u2019t\nknow where they get that number.

This week, we take a look at some of the recent triumphs for the environment sector from all over\nthe globe. This includes the release of Imperial College\u2019s\ndecarbonisation plan for the South Kensington Campus, in a report titled \u2018Our journey to a net-zero estate by\n2040\u2019, prepared with help from Arup consultants.\nR\nesearchers at the University of Cambridge published an article in Nature on the 22nd\nof May\ndescribing a breakthrough in cement recycling.\nThey found that cement could be used as a substitute\nfor the lime\u2013dolomite flux used in electric-arc furnaces for steel recycling. Lime flux works by being floated\non the surface of molten steel to prevent the metal from\nreacting with air and forming impurities \u2013 the waste\nproductofthisisamixtureofchemicalscalledslag,which\nwas identified as having a similar composition to used\ncement. The replacement of lime flux with used cement\nis now being trialled by several materials processing\nplants since the researchers also determined that the\nresultant waste product could be recycled into new\ncement for use in concrete. If this process can be commercialised and implemented at scale, it would greatly\ndecrease carbon emissions for both the concrete and\nsteel recycling industries, two of the most carbon-inten-sive materials used in the construction industry.\nO\nn the 2nd of June, Claudia Sheinbaum was elected\nasthepresidentofMexicofor2024\u201330.Sheinbaum\nbroke several records with her win, as Mexico\u2019s first\nfemale and Jewish president, and its first president that\nhas a PhD in energy engineering. Sheinbaum worked\nat the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change,\ncontributing to the organisation\u2019s Fourth and Fifth\nAssessment Reports with a focus on climate-change\nmitigation. She researched energy use in Mexico\u2019s\nbuilding and transport sectors for her PhD, and worked\non electric vehicle and bus rapid-transit projects in\nMexico City as its environment secretary. Sheinbaum\u2019s\nhistoric appointment promises to be interesting for\nMexico\u2019s environmental commitments, especially with\nDonald Trump appearing to be a strong contender for\nthis year\u2019s US presidential elections.\nA\nt the end of May, Costa Rica finally closed all of its\nstate-run zoos, a process that began in 2013 but\nwas delayed by the automatic extension of a management contract with wildlife foundation Fundazoo.\nExpiry of the contract this year has allowed the Ministry\nof Environment and Energy to go ahead with the closures of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Zoo and the Santa Ana Conservation Center. The remaining animals are in the process of\nbeing transferred to a rescue centre, where they will be\nevaluated to determine whether they are fit for release\ninto the wild or should be relocated to other wildlife\nsanctuaries. Tragically, several of the animals died following the initial transfer, which was attributed to their\nhistory of confinement causing stress. Although the\ncountry still has 18 private zoos \u2014 a mixture of rescue\ncentres closed to the public, wildlife sanctuaries open\nto visitors, and breeding centres \u2014 the closure of state\nzoos has still been recognised as a step in the right direc-tion. Environmental groups have long decried the state\nof Costa Rica\u2019s public zoos, with their animals allegedly\nhaving a low quality of life and unsanitary living condi-tions; this development could set a precedent for countries in similar situations to follow suit.\nW\nith help from law firm Client Earth, the Portuguese Society for the Study of Birds have\nsuccessfully overturned the Portuguese government\u2019s plans for an airport to be built on the Tagus\nestuary. This wetland habitat near Lisbon hosts thousands of birds, both local and migratory, and has Special Protection Area and Site of Community Importance\nstatus. The legal suit was supported by several national non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as\nnumerous activists and scientists who opposed the airport\u2019s planned location. The lawsuit targeted the plans\nnot only on the grounds of wildlife preservation but also\nstating they were not in line with the country\u2019s climate\ncommitments. Although proposed construction on the\nTagus estuary has now been prevented, the Portuguese\ngovernment is now pushing forward with a nearby site\nin Alcochete; the result of a strategic environmental\nassessment to determine the best place for the airport.\nClient Earth has also recently taken on legal action\nto tackle bottom trawling practices in the Mediterranean Sea. Bottom trawling is the act of non-selective-ly fishing along the seafloor, which is harmful to marine ecosystems because it damages wildlife that isn\u2019t\nbeing harvested. The firm, along with the NGO BLOOM,\nare calling for the revision of authorisations for this\npractice to continue in areas where it should be banned\nin line with EU law.\nM\nammoth is the name given to the world\u2019s largest direct-air carbon-capture and storage plant,\nwhich began partial operation in early May.\nManaged by Swiss company Climeworks and located\nin Iceland, the plant is claimed to be able to capture up\nto 36,000 tonnes of CO2\nper year when operating at full\ncapacity. The Mammoth direct air-capture facility sucks\nair into collector chambers containing filter material for\nextracting CO2\n. Concentrated CO2\nis then mixed into a\nwater-based solution and injected deep in the ground\nwhere it mineralises into solid rock. These kinds of\nfacilities are not a foolproof solution to climate change;\nhuge amounts of electricity and water are required to\nrun them at the scale necessary to remove sufficient\namounts of CO2\n, so other climate-change mitigation\nmeasures remain essential. However, Mammoth has\nbeen effective and useful thus far, and is set to become fully operational by next year, and Climeworks is\nlooking to expand to locations in Norway, Canada, and\nKenya.\nO\nn the 21st\nof May, the International Tribunal for\nLaw of the Sea ruled that greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions be considered marine pollutants,\nlegally requiring countries to reduce their emissions\nto stop polluting the world\u2019s oceans. This climate advisory opinion \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 is a response to\nquestions brought to the Tribunal by the Commission of\nSmall Island States on Climate Change and International Law in 2022. The opinion specifies that member states\nhave an obligation to protect and restore marine environments from the impacts of climate change and ocean\nacidification resulting from excess GHG emissions.\nSmall island states, such as Tuvalu, Antigua, and Barbuda, are at high risk from climate-change effects, being\nmore vulnerable to flooding and more-severe storms.\nWITH ZANNA BUCKLAND\nEco frontiers: from groundbreaking\ndiscoveries to trailblazing leaders\nBreaking the cement ceiling\nMadame President, PhD\nCosta Rica\u2019s zoos on the\nverge of extinction\nPlanes, runways, and aviaries\nIceland\u2019s Mammoth operation\nLaw of the sea\n\n"

An employee for an underground\namusement park is caught in between the truth and a\nweb of lies when people start to question the reality of\nconditions in their workplace. A comment in a break\nroom spirals out of control, with amusingly unintentional consequences, but raises broader questions on\nthe true nature of accountability.\nYou wouldn\u2019t be at fault for thinking these were bad\nprompts for a philosophical discourse on ethics and mo-rality. However, in the hands of George Saunders, these\nare tools in an arsenal used to take a cross-section of the\nhuman soul.\nLiberation Day is a collection of nine stories by the\nAmerican writer, five of which had been already published between 2013 and 2022. It is his most recent\naddition to his opus, including the 2015 Man Booker\nPrize-winning Lincoln in the Bardo, and Folio Prize recipient Tenth of December (this contains the bio-dystopian\nshort story \u2018Escape from Spiderhead\u2019 which was adapted\nfor film by Netflix in 2022).\nLiberation Day is the work of a refined craftsman.\nMany of ideas and premises here are echoed from\nhis previous works: the story \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 bears\nsimilarities to \u2018The Semplica-Girl Diaries\u2019 in The New\nYorker, and \u2018Ghoul\u2019 is reminiscent of \u2018My Chivalric\nFiasco\u2019 in Harper\u2019s Magazine. However, neither the rebranding of these ideas nor the novelty of newly introduced ones that make this a great collection \u2013 it is the\nsubversive manner in which they are presented.\nIn the titular short story, human beings called\nSpeakers can be bought, installed like furniture, and\nreprogrammed to deliver performances \u2013 imagine\nShakespeare live on your living room wall! However,\na Speaker must confront his literal and figurative position in the world in a decisive moment, when disaster strikes a wealthy family during one of their perfor-mances.\nThis is in contrast to the much more subtle\n\u2018Love Letter\u2019, where a man compels his grandson to take\nthe quiet road after an unsaid event disrupts their family\nlife against the backdrop of a politically decadent America.\nSpectacle and suspense are significant to why the\nstories in Liberation Day work so well, and possess a refreshingly smooth television-like quality to its narra-tive. When, in \u2018A Thing At Work\u2019, an offhand comment\nby a coworker places a woman into an uncomfortable\nposition with her boss, the vividness of the drama that\nensues feels more akin to a prestige drama than fiction.\nI paused, quite literally, to laugh and applaud its sheer\ncreative audacity once it was over.\nBut after the set-up of each story comes a punchline,\nand Saunders posits questions on virtue and true morality to his reader from the dredges of everyday life.\nSuccinctly put: what makes a good person? And what\nmakes you a good person? Saunders delivers a play-by-play of the answers given by his characters. And the end\nis an orchestra of chaos that puts light to the hypocrisies\nexisting in our own belief systems.\nThere are weaknesses to the collection. Stories with more complicated worlds \u2013 such as\n\u2018Ghoul\u2019 and \u2018Elliott Spencer\u2019 \u2013 built with their own\nunique syntax may be harder to intuit on first\nread, and can prove more frustrating than rewarding to decipher. However, this is minor critique in\nthe face of an incredibly deft feat in fiction, and\nSaunders\u2019 indirect style is worth the initial resistance.\nLiberation Day is a glorious success that sings with a\ncrispness only the short story offers. It stands as a testament to the art of the story, and how it can be used\nto help ground our perspectives of ourselves first, then\neach other, and finally the world.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001b\u0015\u001d\u001c\u0014\u001d\n\u0013\u001e\u001e\u0018\u0013\u0016\u001b\u0015\u0012\u001d\u001a\u0019\u0015\u001c\u0017\nBOOKS\n\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001e\u0016\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0016\u001b\u001a\u0017\u0013\u001e\u0012\u001b\nLiberation Day by George Saunders is a\ncelebration and elevation of the short story.\n\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001a\u001d\u0018\u0017\u001a\u001d\u0016\u0015\u0015\u0014\u0019\u001d\u0013\u0012\u001d\u0018\u0012\u001d\u0018\u0017\u0019\u001a\u0012\u0018\u0014\u001d\n\u0011\u0019\u001a\u0010\u001d\u0016\u0015\u001d\u0016\u0018\u000f\u001a\u001d\u0018\u001d\u000e\u0017\u0015\u0019\u0019 \u0019\u001a\u000e\u0016\u0013\u0015\u0012\u001d\n\u0015 \u001d\u0016\u001b\u001a\u001d\u001b\u0011 \u0018\u0012\u001d\u0019\u0015\u0011\u0014\n\u201c\n\u001d\b\u0014\u0015\u0017\u0013\u0015\u0011\u0019\u001d\u0019\u0011\u000e\u000e\u001a\u0019\u0019\u001d\u0016\u001b\u0018\u0016\u001d\n\u0019\u0013\u0012\b\u0019\u001d\u0007\u0013\u0016\u001b\u001d\u0018\u001d\u000e\u0017\u0013\u0019\u0006\u0012\u001a\u0019\u0019\u001d\n\u0015\u0012\u0014\u0005\u001d\u0016\u001b\u001a\u001d\u0019\u001b\u0015\u0017\u0016\u001d\u0019\u0016\u0015\u0017\u0005\u001d\u0015\u0004\n\u001d\u001a\u0017\u0019\n\u201c\n\u0003\u001a\u0018\u0010\u001d\u0016\u001b\u001a\u001d\u0019\u001b\u0015\u0017\u0016\u001d\u0019\u0016\u0015\u0017\u0005\u001d\n\u0002\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001d\u0001\u0015 \u001d\u0015 \u001d\u007f\u0015\u0014\u0010\u001d\n\u000e\u0016\u0013\u0015\u0012\u0081\u001d \u0015\u0017\u001d \u0017\u001a\u001a\u001d\u0013\u0012\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001d\u001a\u001c\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001d\u0017\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001a\u0019\u0016\n\n"

Like many movies\nnowadays, Challengers\nbanked on showing\nthis in its trailers to\ngarner interest ahead\nof its release.\nUnlike many\nmovies now-adays, it\nproceeds to not deliver at all on the consequent expectation of on-screen intercourse during its 131 minute runtime.\nNot that you miss it: the tennis matches shown in the movie, what with their\nedge-of-your-seat rallies and occasional\nindulgence in racquet abuse, fill this vacancy well enough.\nThe movie opens with the\nPhil\u2019s Tire Town\nChallenger final, between down-on-his-luck maverick Patrick Zweig\n(Josh O\u2019Connor), who is living pay-check-to-paycheck, and international\ntennis sensation Art Donaldson (Mike\nFaist), who has entered the competition\nto revitalise his career following a succession of losses at higher level events.\nThroughout the match we see a series of\nflashbacks revealing the past deep-root-ed friendship between the pair, as well as\ntheir relationship with Tashi Donaldson\n(Zendaya), former star of the tennis world\nand now Art\u2019s head coach and wife.\nThe movie is ostensibly about Art and\nPatrick, and the match between them,\nwhich is shown throughout, acting almost as a trip through the archives of\ntheir friendship. The two are torn apart\nby jealousy, leading them on diametrically opposing career paths until fate\nreunites them in New Rochelle. However, the more emotionally-charged story\nis undoubtedly Tashi\u2019s. Once the cynosure on the court (and apparently on the\ndance floor too), hailed as the \u2018tennis\nchampion of tomorrow\u2019, a knee injury\nbrutally cuts her down before she has\nthe chance to go professional, forcing\nher to settle for coaching instead. This is\nespecially crushing given Tashi\u2019s view of\ntennis matches as intimate relationships between players. After her one-sided takedown of\nAnna Mueller, she remarks sen-timentally, \u201cWe understood each\nother completely\u2026 It was like we were in\nlove.\u201d Tennis is more than simply a passion or a job \u2013 it is an obsession for her.\nIt is therefore easy to get the impression that she is living vicariously through\nArt; his wins are her wins, his losses are\nher losses, his chance to stop his career\u2019s\nfreefall is hers too. A chance for which \u2013\nresentful of her husband\u2019s lack of zeal \u2013\nshe emphatically says, \u201cI would\u2019ve killed\nto have \u2026 I literally would f**king stab\nsomeone [for it].\u201d Yet to go so far as to\ncall her entirely egotistical would be a\nmistake.

She recognises Art\u2019s latent\npotential despite it being obscured by Patrick\u2019s\nshowy unorthodoxy, even\nsuggesting to Patrick that he\nshould be intimidated by the former.\nBut, while the\ncharacterisations in\nChallengers are undoubtedly\nstrong, there is no getting\naround the main reason I find\nthe protagonists so riveting: their\nactors, the trifecta of Zendaya, Faist,\nand O\u2019Connor. Very much aware of\ntheir visual impact, and especially\ntheir sheer sexuality, Guadagnino\nsupplements his leading cast with\ndeliberate costume design,\nlighting, and posturing\nthroughout to emphasise their\npresence on the\nscreen.\nAll this adds\nup to a film\nwhich \u2013 without\nso much as full-frontal nudity\noutside of\na locker room\n\u2013 manages to\nstimulate more\nlust and feel more\nsensual than most\nother R-rated movies\nwith obligatory\nexplicit sex scenes.\nRestraint is king.\nMoreover, the way the\ntrio\u2019s acting plays off each\nother is appreciable, \u2013 when\none is not too busy ogling\ntheir trimmed figures. The restrained expression of Faist and\nO\u2019Connor offers space for Zendaya\u2019s\ndynamism: a comical look of incredulity as Patrick asks for her coach-ing; thinly-veiled frustration at\nArt\u2019s plans to retire; and the roar of\noverflowing ecstasy as she wins game,\nset, and match against Mueller.\nIn a sense, Challengers\nis oftentimes its\nown inverse.\nMarketed as erotic\nyet doesn\u2019t follow\nthrough; has some of the best\ndepictions of tennis in cinema\ndespite not really being about\ntennis; and takes the m\u00e9nage\u00e0-trois romance trope and\nreturns an anti-romance.\nCompared to its peers\nfrom bigger studios, and\nwell-established\nfranchises, it\u2019s no\nblockbuster \u2013\nbut it is a damn\ngood movie.\n\n"

I have often managed the approach with some degree of finesse\nbut blundered as I raised my camera, causing it to scuttle down into its lair, or even\nmore frustratingly, right into the grass underneath. It was only earlier this month\nthat I managed to photograph this species in all its glory, striking blue eyes gazing\ninquisitively into the void.\nWhile I have a bias towards spiders, fence posts don\u2019t. Added to the mix are various insects, caterpillars, and sometimes even woodlice. One group of insects that\nI\u2019ve always been fascinated by is the robber flies (Asilidae) \u2013 aerial hunters that attack\nsmaller insects in mid-air and drag them down to feed. In open areas with a dearth\nof suitable perches, these magnificent insects can often be found on wooden fences \u2013\nwith or without prey, and sometimes reproducing. Bush crickets (Meconema spp.) are\nalso frequently spotted on fence posts, slowly waving their enormous antennae from\nside to side, Ladybirds of all shapes, sizes and \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 spottedness\narrive in numbers when the sun comes out. As for woodlice, there\u2019s barely a niche\nthat they haven\u2019t occupied. They are crustaceans, so their only requirement is a bit of\nmoisture every now and then. While they are often most active at night, I have seen\nmany individuals climbing fences in broad daylight. I am not sure what prompts them\nto do this \u2013 surely it makes for easier exposure to potential predators \u2013 but perhaps\nthey have their reasons.\nFrom my travels across southeastern England, I\u2019ve noticed three distinct kinds of\n\u2018fences\u2019 \u2013 the long wooden ones with posts every few metres, the more urban metal\nones, and of course rural stone walls. Each of these is home to a subtly different array\nof invertebrate life. Jumping spiders (Salticidae), crab spiders (Thomisidae), and running spiders (Philodromidae) looking for a meal seem to prefer wooden fences, while\nballooning money spiders (Linyphiidae) are generally found on metal. Harvestmen,\nleafhoppers, and cobweb spiders seem to like metal fences too. Spiders in particular\nlove the tiny crevices between the metal segments, where they build their webs. I have\nalways seen robber flies on wooden fences, while stone walls can be home to various\nlapidicolous (stone-related) invertebrates such as centipedes. In parts of western England, stone walls are home to the rare Pied Stone Spider (Liocranum rupicola) \u2013 a beautifully marked arachnid that I haven\u2019t gotten the chance to meet yet.\nI can\u2019t remember the exact moment that I first glanced at a fence post. What I do\nknow is that not a day goes by in London when I don\u2019t sneak a furtive glance at one \u2013\noften while talking to someone or walking back home from the bus stop. While fences\nact as dividers, atop their surface is a fascinating assemblage of life that is a bridge to\nthe diversity of the natural world.\nA fencepost jumping spider (Marpissa muscosa) on a wooden fixture at Bushy Park, London, May 2024\nShreyas Kuchibhotla\nA robber fly (Asilidae) with insect prey on a fence post at Richmond Park, London, August 2023\nShreyas Kuchibhotla\nA rare crab spider, Xysticus acerbus, with weevil prey, Bushy Park, London, May 2024 Shreyas Kuchibhotla\nA bush cricket (Meconema sp.) on a metal fence at Regent\u2019s Canal, London, May 2024\nShreyas Kuchibhotla\n\n"

The primary fossil fuels \u2013 oil, gas, and\ncoal \u2013 are unsustainable carbon sources that contribute\nto climate change by emitting greenhouse gases when\nburned. The alternative, a bio-industrial model, would\nuse bio-based feedstocks and synthetic biology to sus-tainably create precursors to mainstream products.\nStart-ups in synthetic biology hubs, such as SynBiCite\nat Imperial, have already started to corner the sustainability market with this new model \u2013 particularly in the\nbio-based plastics and fuels sectors.\nSynthetic biology\nSynthetic biology is an emerging, interdisciplinary field\nin which scientists engineer new systems out of biological components to fulfil useful purposes. By harnessing\nbiological systems, synthetic biologists can produce essential raw materials from renewable feedstocks and engineered micro-organisms. This would help us reduce\nour reliance on petrochemical processes and therefore\nreduce our carbon footprint.\nAt its core, synthetic biology emphasises responsible\ninnovation, enabling industrial processes to evolve in\nharmony with the planet\u2019s needs rather than depleting\nits resources. It can facilitate the development of car-bon-neutral fuels, biodegradable materials, and efficient carbon capture technologies. These advancements\ncan transform how we produce and consume both energy and raw materials.\nBiofuels\nThe extraction, transportation, and refining of fossil fuels release large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane \u2013 both of which are potent greenhouse gases. Biofuels attempt to combat this by being made in a short time\nspan from biomass such as crops and biowaste, which\ncan include plant and food litter. The more recent \u2018third\ngeneration\u2019 biofuels come from the photosynthesis of\nalgae \u2013 producing bioethanol from only water, sunlight,\nand carbon dioxide. The next generation of biofuels use\ngenetically re-engineered cells to maximise the biofuel\nproduced from a variety of sources. This innovative approach leverages engineered micro-organisms to produce renewable biofuels, reducing our reliance on fossil\nfuels.\nBioplastics\nTraditionalplastics,amajorsourceofpollutioninindustrialised nations, contribute significantly to the climate\ncrisis. Their production relies on fossil fuels, and their\ndecomposition or incineration releases greenhouse gas-es. In contrast, bioplastics can be produced from plant\nmatter waste such as crop residues. The key innovation\ninvolves re-engineering cells to convert this waste into\nbiodegradable plastics to create a renewable production\ncycle. These bioplastics can be applied in many ways\nsimilar to conventional plastics, making them a viable\nand sustainable substitute that supports bioeconomies.\nBiomanufacturing\nBiomanufacturing processes use biological systems\nre-engineered by synthetic biology to produce renewable materials like biofuels and bioplastics. Re-engineered cells are cultured in bioreactors and create desired molecules such as bioplastic precursors that are\nthen extracted and purified for industrial use. For ex-ample, Ginkgo Bioworks is a leading synthetic biology\ncompany that specialises in designing micro-organisms\nfor industrial applications. However, the main downside is its higher cost and lower efficiency compared to\nstandard industrial processes. Additionally, biomanu-facturing is yet to be adopted by industrialised nations.\nThe UK and USA are the only countries to significantly\ninvest in synthetic biology approaches to sustainability.\nThis emphasises the need for a global shift towards bio-based economies to ensure sustainable development\nand environmental protection.\nGovernment regulation/investment\nIt is important to note that government involvement,\nthrough regulation and investment, forms the backbone\nof all economies by supporting the development of various sectors. Notably, the UK government has pledged\nto invest \u00a32 billion over the next 10 years in synthetic\nbiology technologies to advance the UK bioeconomy.\nThis substantial investment aims to attract more private\ninvestors, promoting growth in sustainable synthetic\nbiology businesses and driving innovation in the field.\nTackling climate change requires an industry-wide\nshift to sustainable bio-based processes derived from\norganic matter, as well as adaptation of manufacturing\npractices. This is vital in creating a sustainable cycle\nwhere waste becomes our new source of raw materials.\nIncreased government and private investment in the\nbioeconomy will pave the way for a bio-based industry\nthat supports our climate instead of harming it.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u0019\u0018\u001e\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001b\u001c\u0017\u0018\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001e\u0018\u0018\u001c\u0017\u0016\u0015\nFELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001f\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0017\u001e\u001b\u0015\nFELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX\n\n"

Riot police swarmed\nthe surrounding streets, clashing with\nprotestors and arresting over 100 of them.\nIn the wake of the events at Columbia,\nencampments were established on\ncampusesaroundtheUK,includingOxford,\nCambridge, Manchester, Leeds, and a\nnumber of London universities.\nTensions have ratcheted up as Israel\ncontinues its assault on Rafah, a city in\nsouthern Gaza where civilians displaced by\nthe war had initially been told to relocate.\nThe Israel Defence Forces say that Rafah\nisthelaststrongholdofHamas,perpetrators\nof the 7th\nOctober attacks in which 1,200\npeople were killed and 252 others taken\nhostage.\nOver 36,000 people have been killed\nin Israel\u2019s retaliatory attacks on Gaza,\naccording to Palestinian officials from the\nHamas-run health ministry.\nThecampusdemonstrationshaveelicited\nmixed responses from universities. At\nBrown University in the US, encampments\nwere cleared after administrators agreed\nto put divestment calls to the institution\u2019s\ngoverning body, which will vote on the\nmatter in October.\nColumbia University, which has taken a\nmore strident stance on protests, cancelled\nits main graduation ceremony citing\nsecurity concerns. The university will\ninstead host a series of smaller ceremonies.\nCloser to home, students at Goldsmiths\nin south-east London dismantled their\nencampment last month. After five weeks\nof occupation, the university agreed\nto demands including the provision of\nscholarships for Palestinian students, the\npublication of a statement calling for a\nceasefire in the war, and a review of the\ninstitution\u2019s use of the IHRA definition of\nantisemitism.\nFears of antisemitism are among the\ndrivers of crackdowns on protest. The\nUnited States Congress has held a series of\nhearings on campus antisemitism, calling\ncollege presidents to testify. Congressional\nrepresentatives excoriated the presidents\nof Harvard, MIT, and the University of\nPennsylvania for their responses to the\nquestionofwhethercallingforthegenocide\nof Jews violated rules on bullying and\nharassment. A protracted argument over\nHarvard president Claudine Gay\u2019s response\nultimately led to her resignation.\nIn May, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\nmet with university vice-chancellors and\nUnion of Jewish Students president Edward\nIsaacs. Sunak said that \u2018a small minority\u2019\nof people on campuses were \u2018propagating\noutrightharassmentandantisemiticabuse.\u2019\nA day after the Imperial encampment\nwas established, five students stood\nopposite the tents and waved an Israeli\nflag, accusing pro-Palestinian activists of\ndiscriminatingby\u201csinglingout\u2026theJewish\nstate for boycott\u201d.\nActivists at the encampment firmly\nrejected allegations of antisemitism,\nsaying that \u2018anti-racism\u2019 was at the heart\nof their movement.

Attendees will have the chance to participate in\nhands-on creative workshops, interactive family-friend-ly shows, panel sessions and talks, and live music per-formances. Here\u2019s your guide to the nine zones that will\nfeature throughout the weekend of the festival:\nQuantum physicist and science broadcaster Prof. JimAl Khalili will kick off this year\u2019s \u2018Flourishing Science\nTalks\u2019. His lecture, titled \u2018The Story of Time\u2019, will discuss\nhow we can use our current understanding of the laws\nof physics to tell a new story about the nature and behaviour of time.\nAt the main thoroughfare of the festival \u2013 Exhibition Road \u2013 the main stage will be hosting a variety of world-class acts. This year, for the first\ntime, the stage will be hosted by local radio station Portbello Radio. Among the artists performing\nwill be the \u2018Royal College of Music\u2019s 10-Piece Brass\nBand\u2019, London\u2019s top vintage band \u2018The Shirt Tail\nStompers\u2019, winner of the Royal Albert Hall\u2019s Future\nMakers 2023 competition \u2018Amity\u2019, and the punchy \u2018Big\nSmoke Valley\u2019, who describe themselves as \u2018purveyors\nof voodoo funk\u2019.\nBrand new to the festival this year are the NextGen\nZone, designed specifically for 13-25 year olds, which\nwill be hosted in the Smith Centre, and the Science Cabaret Zone which will be situated at Dangoor Plaza.\nOver in the Queen\u2019s Tower Rooms will be the festival\u2019s Tech Zone. An exhibition to keep your eye on is\nthe \u2018Build a BodyBot\u2019 stall, which combines the world of\nrobotics and art. Imperial biomedical researchers have\npartnered with media artist Woo Jin Joo to give festi-val-goers the opportunity to build their own BodyBot\nbuddy out of recycled textiles. To inspire designs, there will be demonstrations of the materials used to build\nreal-fibre robots, as well as displays of robotic kits. The\nTech Zone will also feature an AI silent disco called\n\u2018Swarm Dance\u2019, at which one can learn how AI behaviour can evolve from simple dance instructions.\nFor the biologists, head over to the Business School,\nwhich will be hosting the Brilliant Bodies Zone. This zone\nsynergises the arts and sciences like no other. Among the\nstalls will be \u2018Paint Drip Brains\u2019 where you can develop\ncreative drip paints that model how brain cells communicate to each other, \u2018Heartbeats in Harmony\u2019, where you\ncould create electrocardiographic (ECG) artwork and take\nhome a live 3D scan of their own heart, and \u2013 if you\u2019re feeling brave \u2013 head over to the \u2018Cell Poetry\u2019 exhibition where you\u2019ll have the chance to write your own rhyme and\nspit some poetry bars with a microbiological twist.\nRight next to the Brilliant Bodies Zone will be the\nEnergise and Space Zones, spanning Imperial\u2019s main\nentrance and the City and Guild\u2019s Building. If you\u2019re interested in learning about comets and black holes, head\nover to the Space Zone for a chat with Imperial Physicists Marina Galand and Toby Wiseman about how we\ncan intercept comets, and learn about the concept of\ntime travel. Also in this zone, my friend, Neha Yasin, and\nI will be exhibiting our third-year coursework which\nproposed how we can use radio astronomy to monitor\nthe rise in communications satellites such as SpaceX\u2019s\nStarlink network. Formula One fans will particularly enjoy the Energise Zone, as you\u2019ll have the opportunity to\nmeet with students and staff from the Mechanical Engineering department, and design your own eco-friendly\nracing car that can be tested in a time trial competition\nracetrack to try and top the leaderboard.\nTo wind down from learning lots of brand-new\nscience, the festival will have a bar on the Plaza and a\nFamily Fun Zone in Prince\u2019s Gardens with lots of\nactivities, games, and experiments to try out.\nThe festival will run from 12pm on each day in various\nvenues across South Kensington.

Legal protections for academic\nfreedom are outlined in Article 10 of the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights,\nthe Higher Education and Research Act\n2017, and the Higher Education (Freedom\nof Speech) Act 2023.\nArticle 7 of Imperial\u2019s Charter also\nprotects academic freedom for staff at the\nCollege. It says: \u2018Academic staff shall have\nfreedom within the law to question and\ntest received wisdom, and to put forward\nnew ideas and controversial or unpopular\nopinions, without placing themselves in\njeopardy of losing their jobs or privileges.\u2019\nHowever Imperial UCU argues that\nthese regulations do not provide the level\nof protection afforded by the provisions\nthat were moved out of the College\nStatutes and into the Ordinances.\nThe provisions moved to the\nOrdinances state that Imperial will\napply academic freedoms as defined\nin a 1997 UNESCO document entitled,\n\u2018Recommendation concerning the Status\nof Higher-Education Teaching Personnel\u2019.\nThe UNESCO document contains 19\npages on the roles, rights, and freedoms of\nhigher-educationteachingpersonnel,and\nthe organisations that represent them.\nItsaysthatacademicstaff\u2018havetheright\nto teach without any interference, subject\nto accepted professional principles,\u2019 and\naffirms their \u2018right and opportunity\u2026 to\ntakepartin[university]governingbodies\u2019.\nWriting on its website, Imperial UCU\nsaid: \u2018These are major protections to\nacademic freedom within Imperial\nCollege, and were rightly enshrined\nwithin the Statutes.\n\u2018We have written to the Provost,\nPresident and head of HR outlining our\nconcerns on many occasions [but] College\nmanagement continue to assert that there\nis nothing to worry about.\n\u2018We formally asked the College to\napproach Privy Council to reverse the\nchanges, and to begin a proper staff\nconsultation on the proposal, however\nthey have declined.\u2019\n\u2018No opposition\u2019\nImperial UCU first raised concerns upon\nbeing informed of Imperial\u2019s intentions\nto amend the statutes in September last\nyear.\nOver the months that followed,\nImperial UCU says \u2018it became clear that\nthere had been no consultation with\nCollege stakeholders on the matter.\u2019\nMinutes from a joint meeting on 2nd\nNovember reveal that Imperial agreed\nto a \u2018more-in-depth conversation\u2019 on\nthe proposed changes with Imperialaffiliated trade unions.\nA month later, and before holding a\nsecond conversation with the unions,\nthe College informed Imperial UCU that\nit had received permission from the\nPrivy Council to make the constitutional\namendments.\n\u2018This was extraordinary and troubling\nnews,\u2019 says Imperial UCU. \u2018Not only\nhad College management defaulted\non a written agreement with one of its\naffiliated trade unions, but they had also\nmanaged to get the paperwork through\nPrivy Council, which is something\npotentially difficult to reverse.\u2019\nIn January 2024, the trade unions were\nsentacopyofthepaperworkImperialsent\nto the Privy Council. In its application,\nImperial said it was consulting the\ntrade unions on the academic freedom\nprovisions.\nThe university claimed that \u2018no\noppositionhasbeenindicated,\u2019something\nit would later claim was a \u2018technical\u2019 issue.\nThe error was later corrected but\nImperial UCU says: \u2018It is clear that they\nhave wilfully misled Privy Council in\norder to push the changes through.\u2019\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nPresident Hugh\nBrady said there\nwas no substance\nto the claims.\n\u201c\nImperial UCU on picketing outside the College\nMain Entrance last year.

Sustainability\nis fast becoming a top priority for our\nstudents, and we recognise the moral\nresponsibility we have to contribute to\na more sustainable and resilient future,\nfor both the institution and broader\ncommunity.\nThe formulation of the Union\nSustainability Plan is our first attempt\nto strategise our approach towards\nenvironmental, economic, and social\nsustainability through the theory of\nchange.\nThe aim is to conduct an annual\nevaluation and refreshment of the plan,\ninformed by the actions and outcomes of\nour initiatives every year, to ensure the\ntargets and activities are tangible and\nrelevant.\nThe three pillars\nThe plan is supported by three core pillars\nof focus, including:\n1. College: To effectively hold\nthe college to account on their\ncommitments to sustainability\n2. Union: To deliver Union services\nthat have sustainability at its core.\n3. Students:Toempowerourstudents\nto engage with sustainability\nacross the Union, the College and\nwider society.\nCollege\nAs the organisational advocate for\nour students, we have always and will\ncontinue to engage the College and hold\nthem accountable for their sustainability\ninitiatives. This includes the College\u2019s\nSustainability Strategy, integration of\nsustainability into education at Imperial,\nand the implementation of their Socially\nResponsible Investment (SRI) Policy.\nUnion\nIntrospectively, the Union also strives\nto improve our own internal policies,\nprocesses, and practices to become more\nsustainable. This includes auditing\nand reporting our carbon emissions for\nboth internal and student activities, and\nenacting any operational changes that\nwill reduce our carbon footprint. We also\nwant to revise our policies to integrate\nsustainability principles, and deliver\nclimate literacy and other sustainability\ntraining to our staff.\nStudents\nWe want to enable our students to become\nagents of change themselves to deliver the\nimpact they want to see in the world they\nwill be living in. This includes embedding\nsustainability into our student volunteer\ntraining, having clear and meaningful\ncommunication and engagement with\nour students on our sustainability\ninitiatives, supporting our students to\nhave a positive health and wellbeing, as\nwell as establishing a funding pot for\nstudent projects related to sustainability.\nWhat does this mean?\nUnder the 3 pillars of the plan, we have\nidentified specific actions we want to\nundertake in the 2024/25 academic year.\nFor example with the College, we\nhave and will continue to lobby for the\nexpansion of their SRI Policy to include a\ncommitmenttofulldivestmentfromfossil\nfuels, a sentiment that has been voiced\nby our students on multiple occasions\nthrough campaigning and Union Council.\nAnother example with our students,\nwe have identified volunteer training as a\nkey point to educate our student leaders,\nand equip them with the skills and\nmindset to deliver sustainable events\nand activities within their societies,\ncommunities, and beyond.\nIf you want to find out more about the\nplan, check out the survey consultation\nthat contains more details about it, and\nplease feel free to get in touch with me at\ndpfs@imperial.ac.uk!\nWhat have we done so far?\nTo help us develop the plan thus far, we\u2019ve\ndone:\n\u2022 Initial consultation of the plan\nframework with 30+ students\nduring the October Environment &\nSustainability Forum\n\u2022 Discussions with Imperial\u2019s\nSustainability Strategy Director\n(Harriet Wallace), specifically\nin relation to the Sustainability\nHub\u2019s experience and expertise in\ncarbon emissions measurement,\nreporting, and reduction\n\u2022 Feedback session with the Union's\nsustainability staff network\nThe conversations we have had so\nfar have helped shape the plan, but\nwe want to hear more from our wider\ncommunity!\nOur next steps to refine the plan\ninclude:\n\u2022 Survey consultation with our\ncommunity (Scan the QR code!)\n\u2022 Live consultation session with our\ncommunity\n\u2022 Discussions with senior student\nvolunteers at Union Council &\nCSPB\n\u2022 Internal consultation with wider\nUnion staff body\nOur survey consultation is now open\nfor you to share your thoughts.

The event, held at the Electric\nBrixton, commemorated the theme of\nour generation: sustainability. Fast fashion was banned on stage, with clothes\nsourced exclusively from small independent London-based designers and\naspiring designers within the ICSM body.\nThe dress code for attendees was vin-tage, a theme in which one bioengineering attendee was so invested that \u201ceven\nhis underwear was vintage\u201d. But not\nonly were the outfits from a sustainable\nbackground \u2013 so were their styles, which\ndrew inspiration from all over the last\ncentury; from 20s lingerie to 1980s workout clothes. One could say that even the\nstyles had been recycled.\nThe models and the crowd\nWith over 180 models prepped and\ntrained to perform short dances and walks\nacross the stage, the three-hour-long\nshow was unforgettable. 1200 audience\nmembers of mostly medics and a few bio-engineers came to cheer on their friends\nand coursemates, anticipating revelations\nof previously unseen confidence and performance skills. \u201cIt [the show] is heavier on the dancing than on the clothes\u201d\nmentioned Sahil, who walked in the Boys\nStreetwear category last year and found\nthe confidence to walk the Boys Swim category this February.\nDancing, music, and spontaneous walks\nIn all the categories, performers followed\na simple routine, with pairs or individuals walking up and down the runway,\nfinishing in a short spontaneous pose.\nYou could see the amount of time that\nhad been invested into the coherence of\nthe dance moves, as performers had been\npractising in one three-hour session per\nweek, for several months. Factoring in\nthat each group consisted of an average\nof 12 performers, I applaud the choreographers behind the show. Girls were lift-ed, hips were swinging, and there was no\nshortage of turns and twirls.\nThe dances varied according to the\ntheme of the clothes and the corresponding background music. Although legends Black Eyed Peas, Kanye West, and\nBruno Mars were in the mix, the playlist was dominated by powerful female\nperformers such as Beyonce, Ariana\nGrande, and of course, the icons of the\n2000s, Britney, Fergie, and Lady Gaga.\nTo match this fiery playlist, the struts\ndown the catwalk, which presented each\nindividual outfit, were nothing short of\nwhat you might expect from wild young\nadults \u2013 slutdrops, twirls, and flexing of\nbiceps and triceps alike. Luckily, the staff\nensured all guests were over 18, allowing\nthe show to be entertaining and sexy.\nCame for the show, stayed for the energy\nSOCIETIES\nSocietiesEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nICSM\u2019s RAG Fashion Show 2024 empowered small designers to prove just\nhow sustainable, and how fun to dance in, fashion can be.\nSophia Perera\nOne could say that even\nthe styles were recycled.\n\u201c\n\n"

I have\njust passed my PhD viva (hooray!)\nand I\u2019m starting the next leg of my jour-ney. It\u2019s not a postdoc; it\u2019s a move to jour-nalism.\nIt is important for me to make the\nchange from a career in science to journalism because, well, the planet is on fire\nand I think the world of research is too\nslow and lacking the emotional communication needed to make rapid change.\nThe power of stories\nPeople listen to stories. The most memorable lectures may start with \u201clet me\ntell you a story about\u2026\u201d. We can also see\nthat it\u2019s the stories of climate scientists\nthat make the front page, not their research papers. Last month, the Guardian\nfront-page headline \u2018Scientists despair\namid forecast of at least 2.5C temperature rise\u2019 told the story of how hundreds\nof world-leading climate scientists \u2018envisage a \u201csemi-dystopian\u201d future, with\nfamines, conflicts, and mass migration\ndriven by heatwaves, wildfires, storms,\nand floods\u2019. Scientists are almost allergic\nto telling people how they feel, but when\nthey do it can put their work on the front\npage.\nIt doesn\u2019t always work well. The BBC\u2019s\nToday radio programme ran this story but wrecked it. After reading out the\nheadline, they dismissed it as \u2018gloomy\u2019,\napologised for even reporting it, and\nthen proceeded onto a \u2018good news story\u2019\nwhilst having a good old laugh about it.\nIt almost copied from a scene in the film\nDon\u2019t Look Up, which shows a newsroom\nobsessing to \u2018keep it light\u2019 when two interviewed scientists stress that the world\nfaces obliteration from an incoming me-teor. We are immersed in desperately\npoor mainstream journalism that downplays the existential emergency we are all\nfacing within our lifetimes. Mainstream\nmedia is beyond parody and I believe it\nis time for more scientists, like me, to\nemotionally engage with the media, to\ntell stories, and to communicate the scale\nand urgency beyond the lab or the office.\nWe need to do everything to stop the carbon emissions going up, and up, and up.\nMost of us can link our work with\nthe climate emergency. My air-quality\nPhD can relate to wildfires, for example.\nIt may be surprising to hear that many\nmore people die from wildfire smoke\nthan from the flames themselves.\nOne study from California in 2021\nfound that smoke from wildfires can be\nup to 10 times more harmful than the\nsame type of air pollution coming from\ncombustion activity. Also, mental health\nis affected by wildfires, where suicide\nrates increase in areas suffering wildfire\nsmoke.\nBeyond my PhD, I plan to make a film\naboutwildfires.Iwillspendthreemonths\nin Europe over the summer to ask people\ndirectly affected by recent wildfires how\ntheir experiences may have affected access to food, community, and housing, as\nwell as their mental health and attitudes\ntowards activism.\nA recent paper from Dr Fredi Otto at\nthe Grantham Institute showed that 45%\nofAustralianswhohadexperiencedwild-fires first-hand \u2018increased their activism\nafter these experiences, especially to incorporate ways of sharing stories of their\nbushfire experiences with others. Some\nof these individuals felt that activism\nhelped them cope with their bushfire-re-lated trauma\u2019. Without a journalism\nportfolio, I have little access to funding.\nI have therefore set up a crowdfunder for\n\u00a37,000 to pay for my transport, food, ac-commodation, and kit (scan QR code to\ndonate to Pete\u2019s fundrasier).\nDirect action and protest are\ncritical for change\nI took a huge gamble during my PhD: I\nwas arrested with eight other scientists\nin protest against new oil and gas licences issued by the UK government. I was\ninvestigated by the university the week\nafter it was published in Felix and it was\nused against me, contributing to a campus ban that lasted indefinitely for the\nlast six months of my PhD. But I did it because I believe non-violent direct action\nis essential in times of crisis, and we are\nvery much in crisis.\nI wish that Imperial had encouraged,\nor even supported me to effectively engage with the public and those in power\nthrough protest and direct action. Instead, punitive measures were imposed\nthat were designed to stop me acting\nupon my knowledge. In this sense, I felt\nbetrayed by the hostility in academia,\nand that freelance journalism would\nallow me to be more honest and to act\nmore in line with my moral values. Imperial needs to be much more welcoming\nto protest to foster the open and stimulating environment that we need for pro-gress, so it doesn\u2019t either lose or silence\nvaluable voices.\nAcademics turning to direct action is\nnot extreme, it\u2019s a necessary step to uphold our responsibilities and ethics. In\nfact, Stephen Humphreys, Professor of\nInternational Law at the London School\nof Economics, who was interviewed in\nthe Guardian story I mentioned, was\nasked what individual action would be\neffective, he said: \u201cCivil disobedience\u201d.\nWe have been told unofficially by members of the Climate Change Committeethe advisors to the UK government - that\ndirect action is effective in putting the\nissues into the agenda. It makes a differ-ence: the \u2018pink boat\u2019 action by Extinction\nRebellion in London in 2019 saw a 10%\njump in the public treating the environment as their top concern.\nSo, my time after the PhD will be spent\nengaging in continued non-violent direct\naction as well as telling stories through\nfilm and journalism. I strongly suggest\nthat fellow academics treat telling stories\nwith the same seriousness as they treat\npublishing papers. Our future is in the\nbalance.\nImperial did not reply for a request for\ncomment on Peter\u2019s allegations that his\nactivism \u201ccontributed to a campus ban that\nlasted indefinitely for the last six months of\nmy PhD\u201d.\nCOMMENT\nWhy I\u2019m switching\nacademia for\njournalism\nCommentWriter\nPETER KNAPP\nDonate to Pete\u2019s\nfundraiser here.\nBefore donating, please read\nChuffed.com\u2019s terms and conditions\n(https://chuffed.org/terms-conditions)\n\u2018The world of research is too slow and lacking the\nemotional communication needed to make rapid\nchange,\u2019 writes climate activist and recent PhD\ngraduate Pete Knapp. Pete Knapp\n\n"

Though nothing screams\nhuman (or possibly beaver) interference like artificial barriers, fences are often teeming with life.\nMost invertebrates, particularly in open grassy are-as, congregate at the ground layer. They conduct their\nactivities discreetly under the cover of thick vegeta-tion. However, on a warm and bright day, something\nmotivates them to climb. Mere minutes after the sun\ncomes out, the tops of fence posts become alive with\nactivity as folk from the ground meet those from the\nair in a lively exchange of shared interest \u2013 warmth.\nArthropods are ectotherms, so they require warmth to\nkeep their body temperature at a reasonable level. To\nachieve this, nothing is better than the exposed tip of a\nfence post. I often saunter beside fence posts on grass-land, looking for movement or contrast at the edges.\nAs with most things I do in the field, it is met with confused looks from passers-by, but the rewards make the\nexperience worth it. I\u2019m usually after spiders, and this\ntechnique works for a very specific reason. Spiders can\nfly.\nAs I write this, I sense some of my arachnophobic\nreaders shudder. I won\u2019t attempt to sugarcoat it \u2013 in the\nwords of the great arachnologist W S Bristowe, \u201cWe have\nto get used to the idea of an extensive floating population of spiders, insects and plant spores in the air above\nus.\u201d What is this horde of aerial spiders?\nNumerous spiders disperse via a method called bal-looning, where they let out little strands of silk and let\nthe wind take them to new beginnings. The most spectacular example of this is in the tiny money spiders of\nthe family Linyphiidae. Come a good day, they march up\nto the tops of fences, post boxes, cars, and often humans\n\u2013 and prepare for takeoff. Fences work very well as heli-pads, so a keen arachnologist can intercept them at both\nends of their journey. This is also useful because many\nspiders are too small to be properly surveyed by other\nmethods, and examining fence posts can reveal a greater diversity of arachnid life than one can ever imagine.\nOn a nice day at London\u2019s Bushy Park a few weeks ago,\nless than half an hour of looking at fences yielded about\n10 different spider species.\nAny discussion about invertebrates on fence posts\nis not complete without a mention of the charismatic Fencepost Jumping Spider (Marpissa muscosa), the\nUK\u2019s joint largest member of the family Salticidae. This\nspecies is considered Nationally Scarce (recorded in 16\nto 100 hectads across Britain), but it has begun popping\nup in more and more places \u2013 including some (very\nfortunate) people\u2019s gardens. This fairly large spider is\ndistinctly shaped: flattened and elongated to allow it to\nsqueeze into cracks in tree bark \u2013 and, of course, the\npeeling bark on the sides of fence posts. On a warm\nafternoon day, Marpissa emerges from its retreat and\nbegins to trot along the surface to hunt insects and\noften smaller spiders. Being a jumping spider, it has\nlarge eyes and superb vision. This means, unless you\napproach with caution, there is a good chance you may\nTales of Unsung\nWilderness 5:\nOn the Fence\nbacteria in a resting state. Normally, in industry, DHA is\nobtained from growing Gluconobacter. This means that\nthey produce the compound in a complex culture medium while having everything they need to multiply and\nreproduce, such as yeast extract, peptone, or salt. \u201cWe\nare looking for an alternative by doing it with cells that\nare not in the process of dividing, but are metabolically\nactive, that is, they can catalyse conversion reactions,\u201d\nsays Ripoll.\nThe Uruguayan scientists therefore first grow the\nbacteria; separate them from the growth medium; re-suspend them in water and crude glycerol; incubate the\nbacteria in a shaker with aeration and a certain temper-ature; place them in laboratory flasks or reactors; and,\nfinally, obtain the product of interest (DHA or glyceric\nacid) in a reaction medium made up of water.\nWater as a medium is another new contribution these\nscientists have made. As Ripoll explains, when the compound of interest is obtained after oxidation by the bac-teria, it is much easier to purify than in a complex culture medium. \u201cWhile crude glycerol already has many\ncontaminants, such as methanol, fat, and ash, by using\nwater we avoid contamination by components of the\nculture medium and cell metabolites obtained during\nbacterial growth,\u201d she explains.\nGiven their potential, the scientists are also testing\nthe same technique with the same bacteria, but in the\nfood industry. \u201cWe are trying to make the most of apple\njuice waste,\u201d says Ripoll. Various compounds can be obtained from the sugars in this waste that are useful for\nother industries; one example is sorbitol, which can be\noxidised to sorbose, a precursor of vitamin C.\nUruguay \u2013 a country of just 3.5 million people, and\nsurrounded by Argentina and Brazil \u2013 is an example of\na country that has had to stop blending biofuels with\nfossil fuels in 2022, due to the cost to industry and con-sumers. And although the ORT Uruguay study emerges\nas a solution to this local problem, the researchers know\nthat science is about contributing internationally, and\nabout sharing and exchanging technologies.\nScientific research such as this offers a clear opportunity for industries, governments, and decision-makers\naround the world to invest in increased biodiesel pro-duction. Here in the UK, according to a report published\nin 2023 by the Department for Energy Security & Net\nZero, verified renewable fuels \u2013 of which biodiesel accounted for 44% \u2013 achieved average greenhouse gas savings of 81%. However, demand for the petroleum-based\nfuels for transport is still significantly higher than the\ndemand for biofuels.\nWith greener and cheaper biodiesel production, the\nindustry will incur lower costs, eventually translating\ninto cheaper prices on the market. According to Ripoll,\nthis will make this biofuel more accessible to a larger\nnumber of consumers, ultimately allowing more vehicles to significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emis-sions.\nEnvironmentWriter\nSHREYAS KUCHIBHOTLA\nA ground spider (Drassyllus cf pusillus) about to balloon off a fence\npost, Bushy Park, London, May 2024 Shreyas Kuchibhotla\nX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVI\n\n"

This shows that, at its own pace, the world is\nincreasingly trying to move away from dependence on\npetroleum-based fuels.\nOne of the biggest consumers of fossil fuels is trans-port, which is why biofuels such as bioethanol and\nbiodiesel have emerged as a green alternative, especially since the 2015 Paris Agreement. At that time, UN\nmember countries pledged to substantially reduce their\ngreenhouse gas emissions to limit global temperature\nrise, and many began blending a small percentage of\nbiofuels with petroleum-based fuels. According to the\nNational Biofuels Federation of Colombia (FedeBiocom-bustibles) \u2013 the world\u2019s tenth-largest biodiesel producer\n\u2013 one gallon of biodiesel reduces CO2 emissions by eight\nkilos compared to a gallon of diesel.\nHowever, this biofuel also has a downside, because\nfor every 10 kilos of biodiesel produced, one kilo of\nhighly contaminated crude glycerol is obtained. This\nhas two problems: on the one hand, if it is sold, this\nglycerol has a very low market value, so it does not help\nlower the price of biodiesel, which today costs 70% and\n130% more than diesel on the wholesale market; on the\nother hand, if the glycerol is discarded because it is con-taminated, it has a harmful impact on the environment.\nA group of researchers from the ORT Uruguay university have been working since 2016 on a solution to\nmake crude glycerol more valuable on the market. Not\nonly will it cease to be a polluting by-product, but it will\nalso boost the production and consumption of biodiesel\nby lowering its cost.\n\u201cOur work aims to generate a biorefinery concept\nto take the waste from biodiesel production and turn\nit into other products with greater added value. In our\ncase, we are doing this with bacteria of the genus Gluconobacter, which, in products for human consumption,\ncan be found, for example, in kombucha,\u201d says Magdalena Ripoll, one of the researchers on the project.\nSo far, the team has already succeeded in obtaining\ndifferent valuable products from working with these\nbacteria. One is dihydroxyacetone (DHA), a component\nuseful in the dermo-cosmetics industry, where it is present in self-tanning creams. Another is serinol, which is\nused as a precursor for the synthesis of synthetic antibi-otics, X-ray contrast agents, and pharmaceuticals.\nThe oher product is glyceric acid, a chiral molecule of\nhigh market value because it is produced only in small\nquantities and has significant potential functions. \u201cSome\nstudies indicate that it can be used to treat the effects of\nalcohol on the body. Others say it can be protective in\nsome skin cells,\u201d explains Ripoll. The study of this molecule is currently quite limited, as it is very expensive to\nproduce and buy, so the work of the Uruguayan scientists\ncould help it be produced in larger quantities, through\ncheaper and more environmentally friendly means.\nPrevious studies have obtained DHA from the glycerol resulting from biodiesel production, but they did\nso from pure glycerol. What\u2019s special about this team\u2019s\nresearch is that it is from crude glycerol. This is fundamental because, according to Ripoll, it is estimated that\nin industry, the purification of a compound can influence up to 70% of the cost of the production process.\nBut what specifically do these bacteria do? The project involves working with Gluconobacter bacteria\nwhich, being acetobacter, have enzymes in their internal membrane that are responsible for oxidising sugars\nand sugar alcohols to obtain energy. These oxidations\ntake place in the periplasm, between the inner and outer membranes, and once the bacteria have taken up the\nsubstrate, they expel the product \u2013 what the researchers\nare looking for \u2013 into the culture or reaction medium.\n\u201cThe positive thing about this is that we don\u2019t have to\nbreak the cell to get the product we want, which makes\npurification easier,\u201d says the scientist.\nIn addition to working with crude glycerol, the novelty of this research is that it is carried out with these\nRevaluing crude\nglycerol to lower\nbiodiesel costs\nEnvironmentWriter\nSABRINA CITTADINO\nA team led by Uruguayan scientists is working\non a novel biorefinery technique using bacteria\nfound in kombucha to revalue the by-product of\nbiodiesel.\nThe bacteria found in kombucha can be used to reduce the price of\nbiodiesel Envato Elements\nFELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX\nFELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION \u2022 FELIX ENVIRONMENT: BIOTECHNOLOGY EDITION\n\n"
