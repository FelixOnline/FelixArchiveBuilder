Rich (Gt G) the Shrtertainments Committee has its annual begin-ning s, on that obscure Old Lounge notice-board which\nseems better fitted for the times of Service and Holy\nCommunion than for the election notices of such temporal\nposts as I.C. Entertainments. It is surprising to find\nthat I.C. has had an Entertainment Committee for only a few years. Who ran the hops and organized the Commem.\nBall in the pre-I.C.E. C. days? The Comittee has a big\nresponsibility, for they are in charge of the one phase\nof Union activity in which a majority of the College take\npart. It is only at the hops for instance, that many\nstudents have an opportunity of meeting people outside\ntheir own year. Apart from running the President's and\nOomnsa. Balls members of the Committee are present,\nlooking after th* mike or amplifier, at all Carnivals,\nClub dances and Debates etc. in which their electrical equipment is used. In the summer a dance is held by\nthe Committee for overseas students who are in England\ndoing vac. work.\nThis year they have the considerable task of arranging a Coronation Ball which will certainly be the biggest\nland, it is hoped, the best function ever held in the\nUnion. In the publicity and the tickets, the Committee\nhave already shown imagination and care, which augurs\nwell for the Ball itself. C,J. HORRISS.\nKit Morriss was born in Somerset in1929 and spent\nhis early childhood in Malaya. He returned to England\nand was educated at Oundle School. His experiences on\na course at the Outward Bound Sea School caused him to\nchoose the Army for his National Service, where he became\n2nd/ Lt. and served with the Sappers in Egypt. In 1950\nhe first set his foot into the Civil Engineering Department at Guilds. His childhood voyaging has left him\nwith a love of travel; a love which has been fulfilled for Kit has hitch-hiked and worked his way across most\nof W. Europe. Swedish farms, Spanish Railways and\nFrench rebuilding have all received his attention. He\nonce even worked in England - dustman at the Festival. Kit became Chairman by sheer bad luck. A late\nnominee for the Committee he was elected Secretary, then\nChairman and three Committee members failed to return so\nKit was elected Chairman at the beginning of the session.\nHe has run cross-country - played squash for I.C. but only when the could find no-one else - he says.\nHis likes, obviously headed by Travelling (and the\nassociated pleasures), include Erie Linklater and Van\nGogh. His dislikes are few but vehement - pictures of\nflowers and people who conduct loud Bridge post-mortem s in a quiet Union Lounge.\nHe has been quoted as saying either \"Gorgeous women\nare a nuisance\". or \"Women are a gorgeous nuisance\"\nwhich he actually said is uncertain.'\nI.W. JOFFE\nI.W. Joffe was born in Johanesburg in1930 and is the son of an old Guilds-man. At King Edward VII\nSchool in Jo 'burg he played the first of his selection\nof sports - rug ger. At Rhodes University College where\nhe studied economics he played hockey. In 1949 he came\nto England to take the Intermediate Year at I.C. and is now in the 3rd year Civil Engineering. At Guilds he\ngained his colours for rowing but now pushed his car\nfor exercise. He will be returning to S. Africa this summer with the Trans-continental expedition. His\nchief interests number three. Two show roots in S. Africa the third is Universal. They are - Modern\nArchitecture, Racial Politics and Drama Students.\nTHE REST OF THE COMMOTEE\nJanet Findlater is the only lady member of the\nCommittee. Her nimbleness as disc-jockey at the hops\nis only surpassed by her skill on the Athletic Field. When at school, in Slough, Janet won the All England Schools long-jump championship and since she\nentered the Botany Department in1951 has run and jumped\nwith great success for I. C.sn dU. L.U. At the Inter\nVarsity sports at Birmingham recently she broke the\nladies long jump record. Her interests nat u ally include\nall forms of exercise end unus ally Janet has an interest\nin Campanology and musical Instruments.\nMaurice Anthony Champney came to R.C.S. with a Royal Studentship in1949 and in1952 collected a2nd Class in Chemistry. He is now doing research in a lab. well known for its 'atmosphere\". M.A.C. entered\nUnion affairs in1951 when he was co-opted as Dance\nSecretary. He has served again this year in this post\nand is responsible for the technical side of the work.\nHis interest in dai c ing rises considerably higher than\na \"hop-shuffle\" for he has been elected Hon. Sec. of the\nDancing Club for next session. Indeed he loves to have\nsomeone in his arms - his hobby is Judo.\nMike Rich entered I.C. in1951 but has an insatiable\ninterest in the 1st year course. Mike is another of the\nEntertainments Committee who has strong connections\nabroad. He was born in Mertola (Portugal) and came to\nEngland in1939 to be educated at Mill Hill School.\nSomewhere in this life spent half in Portugal and half in England Kike Rich has acquired the somewhat unusual\nhabit of wearing three pullovers throughout the year.\nIt may have been his love of motor-cycling that started\nit. Brian Wyatt also had schooling abroad - in Cairo\nand Aberdeen. He entered I.C. in1951 to study Entomology after wasting two yes.rs in the R.A.F. as a Radar\nInstructor. He has held the posts of Assistant Hon.\nSecretary to the Social Clubs Committee and Hon. Sec.\nof the R.C.S. Boat Club and is u ally seen and heard at\nCollege Debates. ll ext year he will tread the light fan-ta stic with Maurice Champney, as President of the Dancing\nClub.He likes Music, Opera, Theatre and Dancing. Brian\nis also the only expert on Salvadore Dali on the Coramit* ee, He dislikes record request programmes; people who\ncall spiders insects and having to unroll his umbrella.\nThe Editor Emeritus.\nTHE SEVEN AGES OF WOMAN\nLike man's, a woman's ages number seven\nBefore her orbit shapes its course to Heaven.\nThe first, unconscious, In a blissful state\nShe wends a tranquil way through Cow and Sate,\nAnd like dear Granny (mumbling in her chair)\nShe doesn't know her age, and doesn'to are. The second now; with fat and sticky finger She hunts to find what Santa Glaus will bring 'er\nShe has her private knife, and spoon, and cup\nAnd likes the world to think that she's grown up.\nThe third, the schoolgirl clad in blouse and slip, Spitting at all the boys, and learning how to skip.\nBut see poor Mother vainly try, once more,\nTo tell the bus man that she's only four. The fourth, embedded deep in paint and plaster She looks quite opposite from an Old Master;\nAnd for a secret purpose none can glean\nShe tells her boy friend that she's seventeen.\nThe fifth age next; she sports a golden ring, Brave symbol of her skill in bargaining.\nAnd though she is not far advanced in life, \"Much olde r than her teeth,\" says Brother's wife.\nThe sixth soon falls, and time is getting late, But birthdays stopped when she was thirty eight.\nThe seventh now, and Granny's looking fine.( You wouldn't think that e he was eighty nine). The seventh gone; how sad the sombre day\nWhen Granny, in her nineties, passed away.\nAnd Xldeat Daughter (who is getting on)\nTells the reporter,\" died, aged sixty one\".\nA.R. Bray\nSo r,. Ui is, fifty issues old, coming, I hope, hr lo the prime\nof its existence, l 'hose who were at college on the day when\nfrom the litter of umpteen hostel rooms there emerged a very\nscruffy kitten, looking like all other kittens, its eyes\ngum ed up, its fur puffed up like a young chicken, taking very\nshort steps on such unsteady legs. A bundle of mischief.No\nwonder that we all loved it and took to it at once. How we\nlaughed at its fir'st wild springs chasing leaves blown by the\nwind or ideas which as quickly whisked away. How eagerly we\nawaited the next appearance tc see v/ hat scrape it had got into.\nIt was not very Jong before this crt could get -round very\nnicely by itself; it stayed out at nights, changed its coat,\nbegan lo have regular habits. In fret it began to grow up,\npassing through a period when it was very self-conscious, each\neditor taking himself rather seriously, but not for long.\nGood 8: ir it s,ir re pre sib le humour, and the desi*e to look\ninto every milk bottle and mouse hole, including the refectory\nkitchens, kept it running very sanely on the whole, perhaps\ntoo sanely. Its pub lio became critical of its habits, and\nwanted them changed. They were changed but the great sporting\nI.C. pub lio did not lay 10 to 1 on Felix. Although it tried yer y hard to maintain popularity, its habit of scratching\n[those of whom it did not approve met with quite a sales resistance. However, all those troubles are now over, and Felix, becoming a little too tins poni a neo us,a little too much like daily newspaper, (the standard bri ok s hurled at regular intervals to keep the cat jumping) is now well fed and cared\nfor, established on the best ou shi on in the Union.\nS4 it has grown from the wee thing that could hardly raise\na bit of fluff from an IOTA jumper to a cat that will lift its tail on anybody's doorstep. Let us hope that like its pre-no merit will keep walking- and walking \u2014 and like Kipling's, by itself, no strings and no oat-towing to the prophet that\nis said to be existing in the East. Keep walking and the best\nof luck.\nI hear it rumoured that London has gone to great expense to\nstage a procession to celebrate the occasion!\nAs I 've not written waffle for so long \u2014 although I tried land tried nothing worthwhile has resulted-I'm very sorry. But\nl you have my congratulations for the first half century well\nrun and best wishes for the second half.\nGreetings to all those who suffered me, there must be some\nleft i \u2014 K. P.El ridge.

    "content": "FELIX\nTheatre\n* > f*\" THE APPLE CART. Theatre Royal, nay market.( Gallery book able3/6). THE LOST SOULS. Shaw subtitled this play\" A political extra va gans a\". It suffers from that ogre of the theatre\nthe Indefinite conclusion. But it is not, as man;\nof his later plays tend to be, merely a platform for incisive comment on the ways of the world.\nThe time is the future, and in such a future the\nroyal family is no longer content to christen traditionally: nor is it alone in this respect for we have Balbus and Boanerges and Lysistrata among sia host of odd sounding christian names to add to\nthe fantasy.\nOne might have expected the royal household tc\nhave rushed ahead into a futuristic pattern but\nno l The decor is traditionally ornamental, and\nthe dress, save for Boanerges' most amusing 'uni-form of labour', practically normal. A great\npity, since there is scope for imaginative design\nhere.\nThe particular apple cart which is constantly in danger of upset is the constitutional monarchy.\nKing Magnus, played by Noel Coward sup rl singly effectively considering the part is by no means hie usual type, is beset by a squabbling cabinet of humbugs, led by Proteus, (Laurence Naismith), a boo ring, short tempered little man, who cannot s it still for more than a few moments, and who keeps\ncontrol, such as it is, largely by threatening to\nresign. Admittedly he has a pretty tough job - he\nhas two women in his cabinet, as well as the newcomer Boanerges, \"behind whose naive awkwardness\nlies a wealth of initiative. Magnus has a very\nactive mind, but as king he must keep his views\nlargely un expressed. He sees the political set\nare ruining his country (no wonder, for in this unhappy England only seven per cent of the voters go\nto the polls): but instead of giving him freedom\nto act, Proteus demands that he sign away the\nvestiges of his power. A pretty problem, which\nMagnus solves in a dramatically ironical manner.\nOr in thi a, the king's mistress, deserves much\nmore mention that I can reasonably allot. Margaret Leighton plays the part to perfection, and\ntier provocative guile forms an interesting contrast\nto the matronly queen. The boudoir itself, la viii ly curtained and suitably furnished in grand style, forms the background to the intriguing tussle between Or in thi a and Magnus - a spectacle in itself. Over and over they roll, and one feels that they must soon tumble into the orchestra.\nBut as usual there is a knock on the door, a rapid re orientation to dignity, and calm ensues after a glorious scamper.\nWe axe not feasted yet however. Shaw has one\nmore morsel to offer in the form of the American 'proposal to reunite the U.S.A. to the British Empire. Cecil Trouncer carries off the part of American ambassador with enthusiastic geniality, and gives an amusing, chari cat ure, accent included,\nof the confident, so u less American. His super-fic i ally emotional 'I was born in the shadow of Ely\nCathedral' left me chilled. Singularly enough, Shaw does manage to insert into this fantasy a comment on science, for Magnus\nlaments:\n\"The scientists will have nothing to do\nwith us, for the atmosphere of politics is not the atmosphere of science.\"\nBut need it follow that while a community advances\n\u2022 brilliantly in matters scientific, it tends to\nstand still as far as social and political organ-is ation are concerned?\" R.B. \u2022;\n|THE GUILDS' ENGINEER The fourth number of the annual Guilds' Engineer i3 \u2022 now on sale (2s.6d. to students; 5s others), and is\nwell worth buying. It is written in such a manner that\npractically everything can be easily understood by^a non-s pe oia list, the only exception being on article on\"\npolynomial solving using an electrolytic trough - and.\nthis oo ul d not easily have been simplified. A short,\nfascinating account of speech research and sn article on\nthe new wind tunnel are among the other features.\nAs an account of work being done in Guilds', this\nmagazine is far more illuminating than any prospectus\ncould pds si bly be. Congratulations to all concerned.\n(Review by a non-Guildsraan)\nP HOT0 GRAF HY The annual I.C.P. S. Exhibition was held a fortnight\n.ago. - .Vhile the standard of most of the work submitted\nwas in exceptional, your reporter wa3 greatly impressed\nby some exhibits by a Past President, Col. Bull. These\nwere very like lithographs, but with an elusive texture\nwhich suggested the sort of thing that Seurat might have\nde ne in monochrome. A view of the South Bank Festival\nSite was particularly impressive. One had the feeling\nthat here the o a mera was contributing to art. In contrast th\u00bb deserts of mountains, side streets and heads\nwhich formed the greater parti of the exhibition were\nuninspired.\nJ.S. was quite a ohara e ter. He was also quite an eye full. He was tall ie h,si lavish, and\nhad at tra ot ive hair, fa sein a ting eyes, and a good\nshare of sex appeal (which, of e our a e, is just as\nimportant in males as females i) He also had a considerable Personality Quotient, whl eh soon made\nitself evident, and he was on some eora mitte e or\nother early in his first year at I.C., and he was\npopular on the sports field. He wasn't mu oh of a one for the arts, but he did write a few letters1 to-the-editor when he was particularly roused, and;\nhe was a good debater and conversationalist. In\ngeneral, then, he was looked up to as an acknowledged\nleader in several oi roles. and was quite an asset\nto the College. Why \"was'*? Because J.S. was asked not to\nresume his e our set his session - he was chucked out.\nI don't think he shirked his work, although he\ndidn't seem to be all out for a\" first*', and his Practical was not above the average. He was one\nof those who just couldn't make the grade. Why\nlid I call him \"T.S.\"? Beoause he might be any-body, so he became John Smith. He is typical because about a quarter of the first year entrants\nto I.C. are thrown out ea oh year, and it is not\nthe Nondescripts we lose. Some of the best all round College men haven't quite the brilliance required at I.C., and they have to leave, to enrich usually a polytechnic, or Her Majesty's Forces,\nwith their sparkle.\nFor some reason, nobody ever says mu oh about\nthe \"oh u oke d out bod s\". Felix has never mentioned\nthem, save in a passing refer e nee in the first Felix of the session. But it is a most important\nproblem when a College loses some of the most\npromising people it ever gets. I fear it emphasises\nthe fao t that I.C. is far more of a technologies! school than a University College, and has no time\nfor those who don't show promise of being top grade\ntechnologists. The staff are only too glad to\nlose, and rapidly forget, the so i ent if ie ally seo on d rate. A real University is a place where one's primary obj eot is to develop one's personality and\nintellect to the full, in a background which may\nbe scientific or artistic according to one's temperament. Oxford and Cambridge are like that, but London never has been.\nAll this raises a lot of red herrings. We\nall know that London can't be a University, and\nthat I.C. can't be a University College; they both\nhave too important Utilitarian fu not lons in so oie ty. We also know that I.C. has to chuck out men to\nleave room fort, he cream to work properly, but\nnone of this alters the fao t that the College is aesthetically and humanly the poorer for their departure, which is a very sad thing. It is however one ox ou os e sad things that\ncan't be helped. Without being irreverent, it is like someone dying - it can't be helped, but it is a loss to Sooiety, with the exception that in that\ncase Sooiety recognises its loss, and attaches due\nseriousness to it. I.C. never appears to regret\nits losses due to chucking-out, which apathy I 've\nspent a column deploring. I 've nothing to\nsuggest that should be done about them, but any-thing would be better than pretending that these\npeople have never been. Well, I 've done my bit; the only consolation Ioan see is that the poor\nb lighters are probably happier outside this institution. EDDIE\nWANTED IMMEDIATELY.

'heel.\nHISTORY\nThe present \"Bo\" is the second of an illustrious line of Guilds' mascots. The first was a Rover which\nappeared at the back of Guilds in1919. It was a regular entry in the Brighton Run, until in'33, the R.A.C. became more strict about dates. The Rover was fixed\nat 1905, so he was out. Nevertheless he took part in a number of rags. In 1934 he was left outside 1C Downing Street containing en effigy of Ramsey Kacdonald\nholding an outsize biscuit this being in com mem mora.t i cn of Lord Iiacfarlr.nd's gift of a new Rolls Rovce to the\nfirst La.bout P.M. The Rover finished his days chugging round the\nCrystal Palace Race Track, announcing events during the\nintervals. '.Vher. the war came and the army took over\nthe Palace, Bo. I disappeared\nBo. II, A7/33, was bought, reputedly for \u00a340, In\n-.Shropshire by the late John Garland, who ran it for a few years and then handed it ove* to F.J Pidgeon, who\nlater stored it at his home in Rickmansworth until the\nend of the war. Bo had many Veteran Car Club rune,\nana raced at Brooklands, lapping the old \"Mountain\"\n\u2022course at 29 n. p.h. Bo was made by Messrs. James and Brown, Hammersmith, in1901. Only one other car made by this firm,\n\u2022a 'C4 model, is known to exist. Last year, at the\nend of the Brighton Run, the \"Bo\" team had the pleasure\nof meeting Colonel Brown, the designer, who was highly\ndelighted to see his product of 51 years ago still going\nwell.\nThe days-between '01 and '34 are uncertain, but,\n\"Bo\" was bought from a blacksmith, near Much Venlock,\nSalop, being then a dirty grey and black. He also had\nsolid tyres, but these were replaced by special: old\ncrock pneumatics in'37. Technical Data:\nTwo horizontal cylinders, total capacity = 2464 cc \u2022Tremblercoil ignition.

IMPERIAL COLLEGE50 NOT OUT I52 NOT OUT\nThe Road Test of Boanerges The Great (described\nlast torn by Royalty as \"an amazing contraption) was\ncarried out on 20th t'. ay in the presence of a multitude\nof adr.dr ers, after an even larger multitude had des per ccd, tired of waiting\u2022\nAcceleration tests were performed, motor cycle\nescorts being a sed to record the speeds reached, while\nst ci watches (by courtesy of T. C.A.C) indicated the\nti-os. An unfortunate tendency on the part of the crowd\nto Bpreaa across Prince Consort Road almost lead to ,\nsevere accidents. On one occasion when the crowd parted j to let Bo through at 28 m.p.h. it was seen that there\nwere several cars in the centre of the road, right in\nBo\"s path- He swerved and avoided them.\nAn interesting competition: an acceleration test\n0-5 m.p.h. between Bo and J. Edward Taylor (1949 Triumph\n500). Bo won easily.\nA number of regular Bo drivers were present, as\nwell as several learners, and the opportunity was taken\nof holding the Boy Drivers Championship. This was in\ntwo parts, the first being a Le Mans Start, in which the\ndriver and co-driver had to run across Prince Consort\nRoad with the\"starting handle, start Bo who was on the\nother side, and drive back to their original position.\nFart two1 of the Championship was a circuit- of the. Albert\nHall, this being a test of steering and accurate speed\njudgement. I spoke to the winning co-driver, Mr. Jasper\nAspinall, hot.and flushed a.fter his victory. I offered\nhim a cigarette. \"No thank you.\" he said,_\"Td p nH smoke very often, but wh snI do I'm choosy.\"\nAfter the Road Test, the Motor Club took Bo round\nHyde Park and to Buckingham Palace, to give the learners\nsome experience. A correspondent reports:\n\"The roundabout in front of the Palace seemed to\ndelight Bo, and very few pedestrian casualties were\nincurred on the second time round.\n\"The Hall had made a stout effort to be worthy of\nthe honour now being bestowed upon it and here the general ovation nearly drowned the noise of Bo and his horn, but not quite.\n\"Nelson's column took the unaccustomed vibration\nof earth and ether very well. One tribal chief from\nthe upper Congo, however, mistook a Bo gear change for\nthe mortal cry of a wounded hippopotamus, and was last\nseen sharpening his teeth on the National Gallery railings.\"' SPORTS' DAY The Rag Committee has organ ii eda Hop for Sports\nDay, 8 - 11.30 p.m. Admission is Is., the proceeds to\nbe devoted to the fund for purchasing an I.C. Mascot\nPhoenix (Herbert) It is reported that impecunious\ndancers may obtain admission on presentation of: 1 pint\nj beer in bottle, 1 policeman's helmet, 1 live fish more\nthan 3 inches long, 1 bath tub, 1 five barred gate,\n1 guardsman's bearskin, 1 Imperial State Coach, or on*\nother Coronation Souvenler of sufficient interest.\nThere will i leo be 90 unaccompanied young la die3 present,\nft\nU.L. NEWSPAPER.\nIn continuation of the press conference held in the\nvac, student editors met the U.L. U. president again on\nFriday 22nd. The reports of the four main College\npapers - Pi, King's New,s, Beaver and Felix - were heard.\nThe tone of these reports was cautiously optimistic with\nthe exception of Beaver (L.S.E.), which was definitely\nenthusiastic about the idea of restarting the \"Univer-s it y,\". Background: The first U.L. paper failed lor want\nof staff. The second one failed for want of support -that was two years ogo. This time it is expected to\nget starting sales of 5000, and more later when the paper\nsettles down.\nPlans: The paper is to be about \"Evening Standard\"\nsize, eight pages of newsprint, price 1-M or 2d Reporters and sales managers will be appointed in each\nof the constituent Colleges, while the offices will be\n,in or about the U.L. U. building. The Editor i\"l Board\nwill consist of an Editor, a sub-editor, the news, sport\nand features adit or s and the Business Manager. The\nbusiness side will be handled largely by professional\npeople, and will look after advertising, printing, circulation, block-making etc \u2022\nPreliminary surveys regarding the cost of printing\nand distribution, contacts with advertising agencies etc.\nare going ahead, and the results will be known in about a fortnight. The Colleges in the meanwhile have been\nasked to enlist the necessary support, to find people\nwilling to do jobs on the editorial and the sales sides,\nand in general in the words of the U.L. Prosident Alan\nTate, to spread the glad tidings.\nBURNING PROBLEM. An amusing incident occurred at the annual\nHolland Club versus Selkirk Hall cricket match at\nHarllngton last week. A member of the Holland\nClub was hatting, and was struck on the thigh by a ball delivered by Graham (Get-em) Gales. A puff of smoke rose from the unfortunate batsman's pocket. With characteristic British phlegm he\nwent on batting while a match box in his pocket\nburned merrily. However, he was persuaded by\nhorrified witnesses to remove it and it was seen\nthat all the matches had exploded, singeing his pocket slightly. This story is quite above board,\nand will be supported at any time by the Captain\nof the Selkirk Sloggers, John, Duke of Ellington(3 Civil e), who has acquired notoriety owing to\nhis persistence in telling it. Our Roving Correspondent Reports:\nIt has not been officially denied that there is to\nbe a notice-board in every room of the Hostel Neither\nis it known whether prizes are to be given for t.h*b \u00abn+ answers to the HoBtel Entry Application Form.\nThe Mew Imperial College blazer, designed to fit in\nwith the garish Coronation name posters on the fronts of\nthe Colleges, is to have \"IMPERIAL COLLEGE\" written'in\nsix in oh yellow letters on the back.\n\n"

In the past three odd years he. recorder] many glorious events In I.C., played a large part in keeping the Union informed of its own activities, and managed\nat the same time to keep its readers amused .FELIX\nis glad to have the Coronation celebrations coincide with his own, and wishes everybody good cheer next week.\nIt is unfortunate that a shadow should start creep in pat this time across1'; LIZ. Though this shadow--in th\" form of aU.L. newspaper means\nveil, we ear u rot avoid the. fact that aU.L. paper, to run successfully,:: ust net have competition f. from individual College papers. The latest developments in that direction are reported elsewhere in his issue; the F.X.'X representative at that meeting' \"ave what might he termed passive consent\nto the decisions tah en, for FELIX Is unacquainted \u2022with such problems as printing{ we have an entirely different method of production) and advertising( we don't court outside advertisers) which must he\nfirst thrashed out. The fate of FELIX, therefore, hangs in Balance. he hU'-'T have our readers' yours, that is views on\nthis matter before we san take an p action one way\nor another. The lit' le response we had to our enquiries in the last issue was primarily against the idea of aU.L. newspaper, hut we cannot jud fe the pulse of I.C. from half a dozen opinions. Do\nlet us know your views before June 7 th, so that we\"\ncan say something definite at the next meeting of thi U.L. editors. We present the attempts of some of our pas* Editors at\nshort-notice composition. Messrs Kughes(tft e founder-editor) and Midgley are unfortunately unrepresented.\nThe 2nd edit or.\nOn this famous occasion our first reaction is to\nfeel much older and smile with pride at the achievement\nof our offspring. But then we realize that fifty issues is not much in the life of a newspaper - time\n. will be when she is fifty years old.' If Felix goes on\nas now, she will indeed live to that proud boast, like her fabulous brother Phoenix Consider - did 'Jells\ndream that his plaything would outlive him?\nIn the early days Felix lived from day to day. -We were short of everything - money, news, articles, even\nreaders. But after o. modest start things improved\nslowly until in its second year Felix found its feet with\nan 8000 word, six page paper with a circulation of over\n1200, and thanks to careful stroking Felix has purred\nits way through three and a half years. May it continue\nto do so as it grows.\nAs it grows . . . for Felix must continue to grow\nboth in size and stature. Growth is almost a synonym\nfor life for-\u00abews papers as well as organisms. With-the projected expansion of\"the College, the next fifty issues will cover a 'period-rich in opportunities. We*\nconfidently look forward to a doubled circulation., a larger Felix, perhaps even a letterpress Felix! But\nwhatever happens we want Felix to remain its independent\nand in son cia nt self*.\nC.

Dear Sir, Once again U.L U. have decided to foist their wretched newspaper upon us, and they time with all the audacity of new born pups they calmly suggest that \" Felix\", together with various other college newspapers should\nquietly cea so publication to make way for a \"greater\ncause\". Just like that; no fuss or bother, just pack\nup and go, and give dear old Uncle U.L.l*. some elbow\nroom \u2022\nHow long will it take U.L. U. to realize that students don't want to read the kind of news that U.L C. would like then tc read. The \" Felix\" correspondent\nasserts that we do not hear enough about Senate house;\nthis nay be true, but it does not need aU.L. U. newspaper to remedy this situation. I consider that any\nU.L. U. newspaper would inevitably contain paragraphs\nupon paragraphs about Union \"policy\" and Union \"plans\".\nHow this may be all for the good of cur souls, but I think that most st t idents vc nld rather have this sort\nof news relegated to a. small column in a hinder page.\nTo quote from the I.C.'.'. Handbook \"Felix reports College\nactivities,.. end -oilier news of interest to students.\nFelix is a lighthearted animal., but he can be serious;\nho has no axe to grind save the interests of the College,\nand is politically independent\".\nFelix sells well in I.C. because he is a light hear ted. animal, not because he prints columns about Senate\nHouse and Woburn Square. In other words, I believe\nthat even if all college newspapers did close down to\nmake way for aU.L. U. paper, that paper would never\nentirely capture their circulation. London University\nis too widely scattered for students to display any more\nthan a minimum amount of interest in the activities of students from other colleges.\nHowever, this does not mean that Felix should not\ncontain any University nev js at all} half a page an issue\ncould be devoted\" to Varsity Hews, preferably in the form\nof a brief summary. A report contained in a few lines\nwould probably be appreciated more than its long-winded\ncousin. Please don't let us have any more highfalutin ideas about 'graciously giving way to a greater cause';\nlet us be selfish for once and think about I.C. rather\nthan U.L. U. Yours etc. D.A.D.
