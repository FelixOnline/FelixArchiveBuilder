This organization claims on its website to be\na \u201cnon-partisan group dedicated to\nequality, democracy, and freedom from\nextremism on university campuses\u201d.\nHowever, an investigation by London\nStudent earlier this year accused Student\nRights of being a right-wing pressure\ngroup with a questionable student support base, allegations which they deny.\nJP quoted Matthew Walker of Student\nRights as saying, \u201cJustice Week appears\nto be dedicated to jihadist propaganda on\ntaxpayer-funded university campuses\u201d.\nCampaigning from both these groups\nled to a similar event, which featured\nJamal Harwood \u2013 a speaker at Justice\nWeek \u2013 being cancelled at Queen Mary\nStudent Union in December last year.\nQMSU were unable to comment on this.\nISoc president, Umer Hakeem, told\nFelix that his society was not contacted\nby The Jerusalem Post to give a response\nto the accusations made in the article.\nHe explained, \u201cJustice Week intends to\nhighlight various injustices that resonate\nwith our members and around the world\nand offers Islam as a potential solution\nto these\u201d. ISoc is one of the biggest societies on campus and is heavily involved\nin ICU activities. It raised more money\nthan any other society for Charity Week\nthis year, totaling \u00a329,414.50. Posters around campus advertising Justice\nWeek bear the slogan: \u201cBe the change\nyou want to see in the world\u201d, quoted\nfrom Mahatama Gandhi.\nIn response to the objections to Justice Week voiced in the article, Hakeem\nanswered, \u201cWe encourage all to attend\nour events and respectfully challenge\nour speakers if they disagree with their\nviews rather than attempting to eliminate one side of the debate by censoring\nspeakers\u201d. He added, \u201cWe don\u2019t consider attempts to censor legitimate debate\nas conducive to achieving the aims of\nJustice Week\u201d.\nFelix contacted Jonny Paul, the author\nof the JP article, who admitted that he\ndid not make any attempt to approach\nImperial College or ISoc for a response\nto the article. He said he saw \u201cno reason\nto contact them \u2026 the article speaks for\nitself\u201d, but refused to comment further\nRaheem Kassam, the Director of Student Rights, was asked to explain the\ncomments made by his organization in\nthe JP. He said that he saw Justice Week\nas \u201canti-west, due to the nature of some\nof the events\u201d. When confronted about\nthe investigation by London Student,\nKassam described it as \u201cirresponsible\nreporting\u201d. He pointed to a \u201cpersonal\ngrudge\u201d between himself and the author,\nHilary Aked, but refused to disclose specific details.\nLondon Student offered Kassam a\nright of reply to the investigation but he\nnotes that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see the point\u201d of\npursuing this.\nAll external speakers invited by societies to talk on Imperial College campus\nare subject to a vetting process, which\nthe guest speakers for Justice Week\npassed. Coordinating this process was\nHeather Jones, Sabbatical Officer for\nClubs and Societies, who commented,\n\u201cthe article obviously raised some of our\nconcerns but we have a duty to uphold\nFreedom of Speech on campus according to The Education Act, 1986\u201d. The\nJewish and Israeli Societies were consulted as part of this vetting process.\nIn response to the article published in\nthe JP, the College called a crisis meeting on Monday to review the events and\nspeakers scheduled for Justice Week.\nReportedly, this meeting included college security, a representative from\nISoc, and senior college officials.\nSecurity concerns led to cancellation\nof the first of the Justice Week events,\ndue to have taken place on Monday.\nHowever, these were related to room\nbooking capacity and were largely administrative according to Jones who\ndescribed the affair as \u201cunfortunate but\nactually quite tedious\u201d.\nRory Fenton is Officer for Interfaith,\nwhich promotes good relations between\nthe religious societies at Imperial, and\nsaid that the scheduled event and speakers for Justice Week were \u201cnot damaging to interfaith relations\u201d.\nA screening on Wednesday of the Michael Moore film \u201cCapitalism: A Love\nStory\u201d was followed by commentary\nfrom Jamal Harwood \u2013 an expert in Islamic finance. He said, \u201cthe article is a\nbit of a rant against the Imperial Islamic\nSociety\u201d and \u201call these people are doing\nis whipping up anti-Islamic sentiment\u201d.\nHe assures students that \u201cthe week isn\u2019t\nat all anti-western\u201d and has \u201cnothing to\ndo with jihad\u201d. He also said that, \u201cIf he\n[Douglas Murray] was really concerned\nabout social cohesion he wouldn\u2019t be de-monizing this small community\u201d.\nHarwood is a spokesperson for Hizb\nut-Tahrir, an Islamic political organization that is currently subject to a \u201cno\nJerusalem Post journalist admits\nhe did not attempt to contact the\nIslamic Society for a response\n...Continued from Front Page\nThe otherwise trouble-free opening night of Metric\nwas tainted by violence after a student was forcibly\nejected by stewards and a member of security staff\nwho the Union have said \u201cwill not work at the Union\nagain\u201d.\nThe trouble began as students began to re-enter\nthe Union after a fire alarm at around midnight. The\nstudent allegedly attacked the door staff as he reentered the building and was as a result removed\nto the back of the Union. According to the Union,\nthe student committed \u201ccriminal assault\u201d by biting a\nsteward on the arm. At the time of writing Felix had\nnot received confirmation of this from the police.\nHowever the Union have also admitted that the\nstudent was removed from the building in an \u201coverzealous way\u201d and that a member of security had\ntaken an \u201cold-fashioned attitude\u201d to bar security\nand that his actions did not reflect the ethos of the\nUnion to provide a safe place for students to enjoy\nthemselves.\nAs a Felix photographer attempted to record the\nevents, the same member of security seized his\ncamera and threatened to smash it on the ground.\nThe Union have described the security staff\u2019s actions as \u201cregrettable\u201d and re-assured Felix that the\nUnion is committed to protecting the freedom of\npress.\nThe Union have confirmed that major changes will\nbe made to the security team and to \u201cthe way that\nwe run security\u201d, including better briefing of the staff\non big nights.\nThe student involved didn\u2019t wish to comment on\nthe events. Kadhim Shubber\nCorrections\nIn the article entitled \u201cRector joins London-Brighton Veteran Car Run\u201d, published in Issue 1473\n(12/11/10), the City and Guilds College Union was\nincorrectly referred to as the City and Guilds Constituent Union.\nThe article entitled \u201cRAG Week raises over \u00a32,000\u201d,\npublished in Issue 1474 (19/11/10) did not make\nclear that RAG raised \u00a33269.12 during RAG Week.\nIn the article entitled \u201cA dummy\u2019s guide to Indian\ncurries\u201d, the text for Tikka Masala was erroneously\nrepeated for Vindaloo.\nThe Word Wheel in Issue 1473 (12/11/10) and the\nNonogram in Issue 1474 (19/11/10) were unsolv-able.

    "content": "20\nCOMMENT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 26 NOVEMBER 2010\nT\nowards the end of my second year at Imperial, I was\napproached by the chair of\nwhat was then the Atheist and Agnostic Society\nwith a view to becoming his successor\nas official Union Antichrist. Owing to\na number of other commitments that\nwould have made Beelzebub blanch, I\nregretfully declined. Much to my cha-grin, the society has since done likewise.\nNow, older and wiser as the specialists suppose me to be, I look back on\nthat decision with tremendous gratitude\ntowards my former self. I hasten to add\nthat this has nothing to do with the ludicrous suggestion that I have since found\ngod, nor to the frankly terrifying suggestion that god has since found me.\nMy issue with any grouping of individuals based on a common atheism\nis that such a grouping entirely misses\nthe point. Atheism is not a way of life.\nIt is not a mindset. It is not a school\nof thought. Individuals for whom the\nrefutation of a creator is an overriding\npreoccupation seem to me to be leading\nnarrow and unimaginative lives. At any\nrate, certainly no broader or more imaginative than those who are preoccupied\nwith proving the creator\u2019s existence.\nAtheism, for all its importance in\nthis 21st Century world of Dawkins,\nHitchens and Ratzinger, is no more than\na consequence of having a logically\ntrained mind. Inevitable, but in no way\nnoteworthy. To claim that a non-belief in\ngod should somehow be the dust jacket\nillustration for post-Enlightenment humanism is to show a tragically warped\nview of what is contained in the blurb.\nThe rational thinker will not find sufficient evidence for the existence of a\ngod \u2013 any god \u2013 in the world as we know\nit. This is hardly a unique conclusion, as\nthey will also fail to find evidence for\ngnomes, ogres, unicorns, smurfs or any\ntrace of humour in BBC 2\u2019s Miranda.\nThe need to trumpet any one, logically\nunremarkable stop along this mental\nhighway seems to me to undermine the\nsense behind taking the journey.\nA credible justification for this preference arises from the comparative lack\nof extremism displayed by believers in\nsmurfs or gnomes \u2013 although people\nwho find Miranda Hart amusing are capable of any monstrosity. Nonetheless, it\nis true that the ubiquity of religious belief in America still precludes the election of an openly atheistic President, and\naccusations of blasphemy can still cause\nwriters and cartoonists to run for cover.\nNone of that interests me for the mo-ment. This piece is unlikely to reach the\ndepths of the Bible Belt, and my charming though prolix style is unlikely to\nwin me over any supporters in the Vatican. The only people that matter to me\nare you \u2013 the readers, and the only issue I feel comfortable addressing is the\ntenor of debate on campus.\nAnd as far as I\u2019m concerned, something\nsomewhere has gone terribly wrong with\nthe way self-styled \u2018secular humanists\u2019\ndeal with their religious confr\u00e8res. Lean\nback in your chairs for a moment, and\njoin me on a little thought experiment.\nNot to worry \u2013 won\u2019t take a minute.\nWhich would you rather be: a lone atheist\nin a group of religious students, or a lone\nChristian, say, who has fallen in with\nDawkinsians? Which would make you\nfeel more comfortable? Where, to use a\nloathsome weasel word, would you feel\nthat you were being respected?\nWere I asking this question at the\nheight of Torquemada\u2019s excesses in\nSpain, or in the presence of the sinister cronies of medievalist ayatollahs, I\nwould perhaps expect a different answer.\nBut among today\u2019s enthusiastic guard-Losing proportion\nians of rationalism there is an unforgivable aggression towards those espousing\nthe supernatural or the spiritual.\nThe sad truth is that we are not automata capable of making decisions based\nentirely on a sequence of logical deci-sions. We gloriously and subjectively\nprefer yellow to red, choose to listen to\nVerdi over Wagner, and irrationally love\nour partners more than the billions of alternatives the world has to offer. These\nare not decisions we can justify or explain \u2013 and so long as we are aware of\nthis demon in the machinery there is no\nreason to suspect we are any the poorer\nfor it.\nHumanism at its most fundamental\nlevel embraces the individual over the\norganisation. Our right to be free of\noverarching religious dogmas or political affiliations, and our duty to respect\neach other in this one life we possess.\nIt saddens me that those who claim to\nbe motivated by such sentiments are so\nblindly set on neglecting them when it\ngives them a chance to sneer at others.\nOne does not become a bigger person\nby knocking down someone else\u2019s god\n\u2013 one becomes a bigger person by throttling one\u2019s own ego.\nToday\u2019s strident, aggressive atheists want to fit under the\numbrella of \u2018secular humanism\u2019\u2013 but do they deserve to?\nJustice is a powerful word. It can transcend\nborders to liberate the wrongly accused, to\nrescue the vulnerable and to topple govern-ments. If used cynically, however, it can provide a veneer of respectability where it is not\ndeserved.\nOne of the senior editors on this newspaper is an Iraqi Muslim; another is an Israeli Jew. We understand what it means to\nfeel threatened on campus, and know how\nhurtful it can be to have people presume to\nspeak in your name. Consequently, the purpose of this editorial is not to attack Imperial\u2019s Islamic Society, but rather to defend its\nMuslim students.\nWith Islamic societies around the country under increasing scrutiny from official\nquarters, Muslim students are right to feel\nvulnerable and targeted. The world is clearly\nsuspicious and worried of what goes on behind the closed doors of British campuses,\nand so long as the enemy is seen to be at\nthe gates, the temptation will be to pull up\nthe drawbridge and man the battlements.\nBut further isolation is not the answer. National and religious societies have a responsibility towards their members to ensure\nthat they represent all views in an open,\npositive atmosphere. Such societies are in\nthe unique position of having a membership\nwhich could not be more different when it\ncomes to age, choice of degree, background\nor political leaning. And yet when the society\nspeaks, it speaks for everyone. The bonus\nof having large numbers of students who\nare reliant on you for help and pastoral care\nbrings with it a responsibility to represent\ntheir views with sensitivity.\nThere has been little of this inclusive spirit\nvisible on campus over the past five days.\nThis week, coinciding as it did with National\nInterfaith Week, could have been an unparalleled opportunity for openness and dia-logue. A chance to show critics that Islamic\nsocieties are decidedly not, as is frequently\nand unfairly claimed, sites of radicalisation\nand extremism.\nInstead, Muslim students on campus were\npresented with a series of events dedicated\nto a decidedly one-sided view of justice in\nIslam. These consisted of talks on the exploitation of the third world, human rights\nviolations in Gaza and Guantanamo, and the\nIslamic view of capitalism.\nAre these the injustices that Muslims\nfeel need combating? Not the genocide in\nthe Sudan, or the murder of Kurds in Turkey? Not the victimising of Muslim women\nand homosexuals in Iran and Saudi Arabia\nor the limitations imposed on democracy in\nSyria and Egypt? These are issues that transcends political viewpoint or selective apa-thy: if you claim to associate yourself with\nthe concept of Justice, these are questions\nyou must answer.\nFELIX\nGilead Amit\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nJustice is a powerful word\nand it must not be misused\nIf you turn your back on those you disagree with, take care which way you end up facing...\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201c\n\u201c\nwith, take care whi\n\u201d\nAtheism is not a way of life.\nIt is not a mindset.

    "content": "Week on campus\nbout speakers invited on campus by Islamic Soc\nFELIX Friday 26 November 2010 11\nINTERVIEW\nplatform policy\u201d by NUS. This does\nnot include Imperial College, which is\nnot currently a member of NUS. Chair\nof ICU Political Philosophical Society, Naida Dzigal, spoke on the subject\nof hosting NUS \u201cno platform policy\u201d\nspeakers on Imperial College Campuses. \u201cI am of the opinion that this should\nnot be done generally, but only because\nthe students who organize such events\nare usually of the same opinions as the\ncontroversial speaker or are on their\nway to becoming such [...] However, I\nalso think that there should be an exception to this policy if the event is planned\ncarefully and is conducted with regards\nto the complete student body\u2019s opinions\nand views\u201d. She added, \u201csome speakers\nmight have valuable opinions on other\nsubjects that are not fascist or racist in\nany way\u201d.\nSpeaking on Thursday on behalf of\nCageprisoners, a human rights organization that raises awareness of the plight of\nprisoners at Guantanamo Bay, was Asim\nQureshi.\nHe made news in 2006 after a rally outside the US Embassy in London when he\ndeclared, \u201cIt is incumbent upon all of us\nto support the jihad of our brothers and\nsisters in these countries when they are\nfacing the oppression of the west\u201d.\nLondon-based counter-extremism\nthink tank, The Quilliam Foundation,\ncontacted Felix out of concern for\nQureshi\u2019s platform on Imperial College campus. Their research stretches\nfrom radicalisation on university campuses to the BNP\u2019s demonisation of\nBritish Muslims. They provided Felix\nwith transcripts of speeches made by\nQureshi at Queen Mary Student Union\n(QMSU). In December 2006 at QMSU,\nwhile discussing suicide bombings in\nPalestine, he said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re talking\nabout things like martyrdom operations,\nthen its not for us to judge anything because we don\u2019t live out in those places\u201d.\nAgain at QMSU in January 2007, while\ndiscussing the actions of a group of female Chechen suicide bombers called\nthe \u2018Black Widows\u2019, he said \u201cwe are\nnot here to judge them. We do not live\nin their paradigm, we do not live their\ndaily lives\u201d.\nSpeaking about Qureshi \u2013 Lucy\nJames, a research fellow at Quilliam,\nsays \u201che has clearly condoned acts of violence abroad in the past\u201d and his presence on campus is \u201cbeyond a Freedom\nof Speech issue\u201d. Felix attempted to\ncontact Qureshi but he was not available\nfor a response. The Quilliam Foundation\nalso voiced concerns as to whether the\nvetting process for external speakers at\nuniversity campuses is currently tight\nenough.\nJustice Week ends with talks by Professor Norman Finkelstein on the 2009\nGaza Invasion, in connection to his new\nbook \u201cThis Time We Went Too Far:\nTruth and Consequences of the Gaza\nInvasion\u201d. Next week\u2019s issue of Felix\nwill include an interview with Professor\nFinkelstein by our political editor. Tickets for the event with Finkelstein sold\nout within 24 hours. However, a second\ntalk later on the same night was scheduled to capacitate the extra demand and\ntickets have been made available to non-Imperial students. Finkelstein\u2019s UK tour\nhas been accompanied by a Facebook\ngroup \u201cNo to hate! No to Norman Finkelstein!\u201d This group plans to protest at\nall of the dates on his UK tour, including Imperial College, but is limited to\na small number of individuals - at time\nof printing only 9 people have declared\nattendance. The talks take place tonight\n(Friday) from 6pm and will be held in\nthe Clore Lecture Theatre in the Huxley Building. Tickets are \u00a35 and can be\nbought from the ICU website; protesting\nat the event will be free.\nA spokesperson from the college\nwrote to Felix about Justice Week. \u201cImperial College London campuses are\nplaces of intellectual debate, tolerance\nand openness among its diverse staff\nand student community\u201d. And \u201cthe College has concluded that the events taking place during Justice Week meet the\nrequirements under its Code of Practice\non Freedom of Speech\u201d.\nEditorial: Page 20\nCageprisoners\nThis is a human rights campaign\ngroup which gives a voice to detainees in the war on terror.\nRecently, they have taken on\nthe case of Aafia Siddiqui who\nwas convicted in September of\nattempting to kill her US inter-rogators. She was subsequently\nsentenced to 86 years in prison.\nThey obtained an exclusive interview with Anwar al-Awlaki, the\ninfamous Islamic preacher, after\nrelease without charge from US\ndetention. Since his release, he\nis believed to have radicalized\nUmar Farouk Abdulmutallab, former student and president of\nISoc at UCL, who made a suicide\nbombing attempt in December\nlast year.\nHizb ut-Tahrir\nHizb ut-Tahrir translates into English as \u201cparty of liberation\u201d. They\nare a radical political organisation\nwhich seeks to establish a \u2018Caliphate\u2019 \u2013 an Islamic state across\nthe Middle East. It is opposed to\nwestern-style democracy as we\nknow it.\nThey hold the view that \u2018jihad\u2019\nis a part of Islam but do not advocate violence, instead encouraging intellectual debate. However,\ntheir ideology is shared by groups\nwhich do support violence.\nTony Blair said he would ban the\nBritish branch of the party while\nstill PM, but ultimately did not\ncarry out action against them.\nAfter gaining Fairtrade status in September 2007 but then failing to renew\nit in 2009, Imperial is rushing to ensure that it doesn\u2019t drop off the list of\n130 Fairtrade universities and colleges.\nDesperate efforts are being made by\nthe Fairtrade society, union sabbaticals\nand college in order to retain the status\nbut they have been met with opposition\ndue to the higher costs associated with\nFairtrade products. Gemma Morris,\nhead of catering operations has said that\n\u201calthough the renewal is overdue this is\nnot an indication that Imperial has in any\nway lost its commitment to Fairtrade.\u201d\nSo should students be forced to pay\nmore for their food and clothing? And\nshould the Union shop potentially run at\na loss, or face a decline in sales for the\nFairtrade cause? Felix investigates the\nimportance of fair-trade status at Imperial and attitudes around college.\nBut firstly, what does Imperial need\nto do to renew its status? There are five\ngoals which must be achieved to ensure\nFairtrade status. Firstly, the Student\nUnion and universities authorities must\ncreate a fairtrade policy which encapsulates the details of the other goals.\nDeputy President (Welfare) Charlotte\nIvison told Felix that she \u201caims to present a Fairtrade policy to Council early\nnext term which will specify our goals\nand commitments regarding Fairtrade\u201d.\nSecondly, Fairtrade food and drinks\nshould be made available for sale in all\ncampus shops and used in all restaurants and bars, a goal largely being met\nalready. For example, all tea and coffee\nsold on campus is 100% Fairtrade. Similarly, the third goal stating that Fairtrade\nfood and drinks should be served at all\nmeetings hosted by the university or student union is also already being met.\nThe fourth goal states that there\nshould be a commitment to campaigning for increased Fairtrade consumption\non campus. This is where Imperial\u2019s\nFairtrade society comes in, holding\nstudent-related events throughout the\nyear. The biggest event, Fairtrade Fortnight, will take place from 28 February\nto 13 March 2011, and aims to persuade\npeople to replace their normal purchases\nwith Fairtrade alternatives. However,\nthe application for renewing the college\u2019s Fairtrade status requires proof of\nsuch events and it is likely that the forms\ncannot be submitted until Fairtrade Fortnight has taken place next year.\nLastly, a Fairtrade steering group must\nbe established, made up of students,\nmembers of Commercial Services, catering staff and the union, another goal\nalready achieved.\nHowever, there is fuel for potential\nconflict at Union Council if the renewal\nis to require an increase in pricing of\nunion products. Scott Heath, RCSU\nPresident, argued that \u201cstudents would\nrather the beer prices at the bar be reasonable than for us to have Fairtrade\nStatus\u201d.\nThere has also been speculation that\nall the Union\u2019s clothing products must\nbe sourced from Fairtrade cotton, a\nmove that would significantly increase\ncosts of Imperial branded clothing in the\nUnion shop.\n\u201cIf I have to vote between the outright\nuse of Fairtrade cotton and a dramatic\nincrease in clothing prices, or a loss of\nincome, I will always vote against [the\nuse of fairtrade cotton]\u201d, said Scott\nHeath. However, he added that \u201cif it is\nshown that the raise in cost for clothing\nwould be low then I would more than\nhappily support and assist this new certification.\u201d\nThese views are mirrored by those of\nmany students around college. One student commented that whilst he would be\n\u201cvery happy to pay an extra 20p or so for\nFairtrade tea or coffee, a hike in clothing prices of several pounds would not\nbe welcomed.\u201d\nSome also believe that forcing stu-dents, already financially burdened, to\npay extra for Fairtrade products is unfair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re earning \u00a3100,000,\nwe have weekly food budgets\u201d, commented another student.\nFelix has since found that although\nthe university must show commitment\nto sourcing Fairtrade cotton where pos-sible, it is not yet a full requirement.\n\u201cThere currently isn\u2019t wide enough\navailability\u201d, said Sarah Jewell, Campaign Manager of the Fairtrade Foundation.\nShe also added that the Fairtrade Foundation have launched a Fairtrade cotton\ncampaign that will result in \u201ccompetitively priced cotton that universities can\npurchase\u201d.\nUnsurprisingly, Noor Hasnan, Chair\nof the ICU Fairtrade society would feel\n\u201chugely disappointed\u201d if Imperial was to\nlose Fairtrade status. \u201cBeing a Fairtrade\nuniversity is our acknowledgement that\nthere are still unfair trading practices going on in the third world countries. If we\nlose it, people will see us in a completely different light, even though we do\nhave all the Fairtrade products in store\nand related events throughout the term.\u201d\nAnother student commented that\n\u201cpeople are willing to spend twice the\nprice of a normal product for one with a\nfashionable brand, so why not pay a bit\nmore for Fairtrade?\u201d\nWith such conflicting views on\nFairtrade products, students need\nchoice, which is something that Deputy\nPresident Charlotte Ivison supports: \u201cwe\ndon\u2019t want to force students but hopefully they\u2019ll make an informed choice\nabout paying more for Fairtrade or not.\u201d\nFairtrade fuss over\nstatus renewal\nSophia David\n\n"

Go to the Puzzles section >>\nImmortals secure their\nmaiden victory\nGeorge Barnes\nAfter last weeks thrilling opening game\nthe Imperial Immortals knew that their\nfirst win wasn\u2019t far off and they duly delivered the first victory in team history\nwith a convincing win over the Royal\nHolloway Bears. It was a marked contrast to last season\u2019s meeting when the\nBears left Imperial with a 28-0 win and\nshows how far the Immortals have come\nin a short space of time.\nImperial had impressive away support thanks to their cheerleading squad\nmaking the journey to Egham and after\nan immaculately observed minutes silence in honour of Remembrance Sunday, the Immortals won the toss and decided to kick-off. This opening kick-off\nset the tone for the game as the Bears\nreturner fumbled the ball and Immortals viper Dexter Valencia recovered,\ngiving the Immortals offence good\nfield position inside the Bears half. A\nfalse start and an early sack conceded\nstopped the offence capitalising, but\nthe defence stepped up and forced the\nBears to a three-and-out.\nHaving shaken off the earlier drive,\nthe offence set to the task in hand and an\nexcellent drive led to a go-ahead score\nfor running-back Tino Millar. Rookie\nhalf-back Alistair Boyce set the drive in\nmotion with an impressive 55 yard run\nand a 20 yard reception by tight end Michael Peacock put the Immortals in the\nBears half of the field. Solid blocking by\nthe offensive line, led by rookie centre\nJackson Xing, gave Millar the room to\nrush for a 24 yard touchdown, his third\nof the season. The ensuing 2-point conversion failed giving the Immortals a\n6-0 lead.\nNot to be outdone the defence delivered a takeaway on the Bears next drive\nas linebacker Artur Jarzabek forced a\nfumble for defensive lineman Quirin\nGrossman to recover. The offence once\nmore took to the field but solid runs by\nMillar and quarterback Rob Wolstenholme were wiped out by a false start\nand a holding penalty, forcing the Immortals to punt. In a hurry to get the ball\nback, the defence took advantage of a\nfumbled hand-off by the Bears offence\nand viper Charles Kennedy pounced to\nrecover for Imperial.\nWith good field position, the Immortals handed the ball off to fullback Alex\nKarvelas and the veteran carried the ball\n2 yards across the goalline for a career\nfirst touchdown. The 2-point conversion\nfailed and the Immortals now had a 12-0\nlead.\nThe second half saw the Immortals\ntake control of the game as both their\noffensive and defensive lines began\nto dominate the tiring Bears linemen,\nthanks in no small part to Quirin Grossman and Zubin Jehangir. Jehangir burst\nthrough the Holloway offensive line to\nsack the quarterback and force a fumble\nwhich was narrowly recovered by the\nBears and Grossman dominated the\nline so thoroughly that Holloway went\nso far as to change their starting centre.\nJackson Xing, who impressed in his\ndebut against Surrey, led the offensive\nline brilliantly with able support from\nMarcus Shepherd, Frederico \u201cMassa\u201d\nSanches and Peter Lipka. Lipka distinguished himself in particular when\nWolstenholme was intercepted and the\noffensive lineman rushed half the length\nof the field to make a touchdown-saving\ntackle.\nThe offence moved the ball well, with\nKarvelas denied a second touchdown\nwhen his run was called back for a holding penalty and despite further good running from Alistair Boyce and a 12 yard\nreception by wide receiver Charles Edwards the Immortals were unable to add\nto their score. The defence continued\nto make plays and were unlucky not to\nscore themselves when Artur Jarzabek\nintercepted a pass on the half-way line\nand ran the ball back to the 1. Safety Arjav Trivedi also opened his interception\naccount with his first pick of the season\nand Dexter Valencia added a sack late in\nthe game.\nA stirring first win for the team sees\nthem move to a 1-1 record. In truth\nthe Immortals could have and perhaps\nshould have won by more than a 12\npoint margin, but with the defence recording it\u2019s first shut-out in club history,\nthe team is on the up.\nThe Immortals carried on from their\nmaiden victory, trained hard and recorded their second victory within a\nweek overcomming the London South\nBank Spartans 20-14 in overtime after\nthe fulltime score ended 14-14. This allowed the Immortals to move onto a 2-1\nrecord putting them in a good position.\nFurther London derbies against Brunel\nand Kings College are on the schedule\nfor December and the Immortals will\nknow that if they can cut out mistakes\nthey stand a very good chance of maintaining their winning record into the\nnew year.\nImperial Immortals 12\nRoyal Holloway Bears 0\nI,SCIENCE\nTHE SCIENCE MAGAZINE OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nnext issue out 10th december\nFIND I, SCIENCE AT ALL NORMAL FELIX DISTRIBUTION POINTS\n\n"

Then let me fill you\nin \u2013 you can thank me later. The OLMC comes\nwith a wireless controller (usable only for the\nMicroConsole, mind) and rechargeable bat-teries, so that you don\u2019t have to spend more\nmoney on fresh batteries and can instead splash\nout on crusts of dry bread.

What is OnLive? As a most learned and informed gentleman let me guide you along the path to nirv\u0101na.\nOnLive is a form of cloud computing, where\ngame processing and synchronization occurs\non remote servers, controlled from a video feed\n(up to 1080p) delivered to your laughably bad\nPC or Mac (at least OS X 10.5.8) via the miracle that is the Internet.

They hope to do this by changing the way the college licenses out its patents\nconcerning healthcare-related technologies, including but not limited to therapeutic drugs. 10 million\npeople a year die from diseases that have available\ncures, because of limited access to drugs. As not-for-profit organisations, universities are in a unique\nposition to alter the way drugs are licensed in developing countries, so that research done on campus\ncan make a difference to as many lives as possible.\nUAEM started out at Yale in 2001 when both students and academics campaigned for the availability of the HIV antiretroviral (ARV) stavudine for generic production. Since then, UAEM has spread all over\nthe world and has changed the licensing policies\nof many universities, particularly in America. Last\nyear saw the signing of the Statement of Principles\nand Strategies for the Equitable Dissemination of\nMedical Technologies (SPS) by 20 institutions in the\nUS, including the Centers for Disease Control, the\nNational Institute of Health, and the Association of\nUniversity Technology Managers (AUTM). This was\na huge advance for improving access to essential\nmedicines in developing countries, but we still have\na long way to go. Within the UK, the Universities of\nOxford and Edinburgh recently adopted Global Access Licensing Policies. UAEM argues that if Imperial is to maintain it\u2019s position as a centre for excellence in the field of Global Health, it should be a\nforerunner of this movement.\nAnother aim of UAEM is to promote research into\nneglected tropical diseases (NTDs). These diseases\naffect the world\u2019s poorest people and are seriously\nunder-funded. In fact, only 10% of R&D investment\ngoes towards research into 90% of the world\u2019s\nhealth problems. Imperial is one of the few institutions in the UK to have an organisation entirely devoted to NTD research, called The Schistosomiasis\nControl Initiative, which is based at the St Mary\u2019s\nCampus. UAEM would like to see NTD research being integrated into the Life Sciences and Medicine\ncurriculums within Imperial and across the UK.\nNext Wednesday (1st December) is World AIDS\nDay. UAEM is organising an awareness campaign in\nTrafalgar Square. The hope is that this will put pressure on pharmaceutical companies to put patents\nfor HIV ARVs into the patent pool.\nMany ARVs are now available, but at astronomical\nprices well beyond the reach of citizens of developing countries. It is important that students as well\nas humanitarian campaigners put pressure on the\nuniversities and pharmaceutical companies to put\nARV patents into the patent pool to allow the generic\nproduction of ARVs at dramatically reduced costs.\nThe aim is to think of the Trafalgar Square fountains\nas the patent pool, and the campaigners (dressed\nin red, of course) as the patents. Make sure you\ncome along!\nToday (26/11/10) there will be workshops for the\nNTD and Research Team at 4pm in SAF and the IP\nand Law Team at 5pm in Room 119 SAF. To get\ninvolved with UAEM, email uaem@imperial.ac.uk, or\ncome along to the next general meeting at 5pm on\n30/11/10 in SAF G70.

After many of Imperial\u2019s first team graduated last year, eyes were on the freshers to impress and work their way in to the team to help\ndefend our BUCS gold medal later in the year.\nEntrants to this year\u2019s tournament ranged\nfrom absolute beginners through to a national\nchampion.\nFinalist Jonathan Morrow had the most eventful route to the final, beating Jonathan Hoong\n2-1 in the quarterfinal from 1-0 down, and more\nimpressively coming from 2-1 behind to secure\nhis place in the final, beating Bobo Kijac 3-2.\nMeeting Jonathan in the final was one of Romania\u2019s finest, Bogdan Cozmaciuc. Bogdan\nhad reached the final winning all his matches in\nstraight frames and registering the two highest\nbreaks of the tournament.\nSo the final was set, the unbeaten Bogdan\nCozmaciuc versus the come-back king Jonathan Morrow. As expected, Bogdan took an\nearly lead in the best of seven match, claiming\nthe first three frames. The scene was set for another amazing come-back from Jonathan Morrow, but could he actually come back to claim\nFreshers\u2019 tournament 2010 victory and be the\nsubject of one of the finest underdog stories of\nall time?\nNo!\nBogdan left his mark as Imperial\u2019s best new-bie, claiming the final 4-0 and keeping his unbeaten record.\nCoached by his father, who gained coach-ICU Snooker discover\nfresher Champion\nThe intense stare that every (fresher) Champion has is not lacking here\ning qualifications from the prestigious Terry\nGriffiths\u2019 Snooker Academy, Bogdan has also\ncompeted in European and World Championships, and played professionals Mark King and\nthe legendary Jimmy White.\nNext in Bogdan\u2019s sights is the Internal\nLeague, where the entire club competes in a\nleague and knockout format to find the clubs\nnumber one. Surely a prize he is longing to\nput next to his already earned title of \u2018National\nChampion of Romania\u2019 in the under-19 and\nmens categories.\nSign up for the Internal League is now open\nto all ICU Snooker members. For all those who\nfeel beating the likes of Bogdan and reigning\nchampion Sam Dennis is a steep challenge, there\nare two tiers to allow players of any standard a\nlong and prosperous tournament experience.\nSports personality draws near\nDavid Wilson\nOn the 19th of December the BBC will host the\n57th annual Sports Personality of Year awards\nat the LG Arena in Birmingham. Many people\nmay think that this has been a relatively lean\nyear as far as British sport is concerned, there\nhasn\u2019t been too much to shout about especially\nas the \u2018golden generation\u2019 of English football\nfailed so miserably at the World Cup. There\nhave, however, been a number of sporting\nachievements of note.\nGraeme McDowell won the US Open this\nyear and in doing so became the first European\nto win that major in 40 years. Not only that, but\nMcDowell played in the final singles match of\nthe Ryder Cup and sunk the final putt which\nensured that the cup rightfully returned to Europe. Such exploits mean that McDowell will\nbe favourite for the award this year.\nNot to be outdone by his compatriot, Lee\nWestwood is the current world number one, a\npretty big achievement when you consider than\nthe previous incumbent of that title was a certain Mr Tiger Woods who had stood at the summit of world golf for 281 weeks before Westwood knocked him off of his perch.\nFebruary seems like a long time ago, but\nduring that month Amy Williams won gold at\nthe Vancouver Winter Olympic Games, throwing herself down an open topped tunnel made\nof ice on a slab of metal. Williams won a gold\nmedal in the skeleton event, the first Briton to\nwin an individual gold at the winter Olympics\nfor 30 years. The low profile of winter sports\nmeans that Williams is likely to be an outsider\nfor the title this and any other year.\nMark Cavendish won five stages of the Tour\nde France this year and save for a relatively\npoor start to the tour he would have won the\ncoveted green sprint jersey. Cavendish is a\nvolatile person who tends to stay away from\nthe media as he feels he is often misrepresent-ed. A strong fourth place finish in last years\nSports Personality competition means that he\ncould well be in contention for the title this\nyear.\nJessica Ennis didn\u2019t compete in too many\ncompetitions this season but still managed to\nadd the European title to her growing medal\nhaul as well as captaining the British side at the\nAviva International meet in Glasgow. The poster girl of the 2012 Olympics competed in only\na limited amount of competitions this season in\norder to focus on upcoming London Olympics.\nTom Daley overcame Delhi belly to win two\nCommonwealth gold medals. To put this in per-spective, Daley is 16 years old and he beat the\n2008 Olympic champion in order to win the individual Commonwealth title. Daley has youth\non his side and will likely win many more medals over the coming years.\nDavid Haye would surely have been in with a\nshout of the title if he had fought anyone other\nthan Fr-Audley \u2018A-Farce\u2019 Harrison earlier this\nmonth. Unifying the heavyweight division is\nHaye\u2019s aim in the coming year and perhaps\nwith it the Sports Personality title.\nLast year produced a shock winner in the\nform of Ryan Giggs, so this year John Terry\ncould win Sports Personality with Fabio Capello collecting the coach award.\n\n"

We meet the playwrights to talk about th\nWe want to know what to read next. Tell us in 300-400 words and send it to arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial Talent, Class\nCommunism is dead. The final failure of the Soviet\nUnion, the movement of our labour party away from\nits socialist roots and the lack of the necessary\nsocial tension for a revolution have rendered its\ndreams unattainable and removed this ultimate outsider and enemy from western political discussion.\nThe great issue of today is instead, once again,\nthe debate over the extent and power of govern-ment. This has an enormous precedence: it is an\nold, long, complicated back and forth with endless\nswapping of names and ideas and an absolutely dis-by\nAyn Rand\nAtlas Shrugged\nDo you all want to start by telling us a bit\nabout what your plays are like?\nGilead: Let\u2019s see, mine is a musical revue in\nthe traditional sense of a revue, lots of catchy\ntunes with different words put to them, largely\nbased on all the anecdotes I\u2019ve picked up over\nmy three years here. It sends up all the trends\nand attitudes and habits that you know and love\naround you, and it\u2019s all sung by a wonderful\ncast and accompanied by a fantastic fourteen\npiece band.\nShamini: There are lots of very well-known\nsongs in yours actually, people will definitely\nknow the songs\nGilead: Yes, you\u2019ll walk out whistling them\nand hating me for choosing them.\nShamini: But really funny new lyrics...\nGilead:Am I paying you for this endorsement?\nI feel like I should be!\nShamini: Mine\u2019s a shakespearean, panto-mime, melodramatic, murder mystery, horror,\nnon-musical. It has lots of blood and horrible\ndeaths, but it also has knitting\u2026 It\u2019s irreverent\nand a lot of fun, there are fewer Imperial refer-ences, to be honest mine\u2019s got a lot more geeky\nreferences. A lot of science fiction and fantasy\npop culture references, which is still something\nI think appeals to a lot of students - I hope it\u2019s\nnot just me! It\u2019s really good fun and very funny.\nYou get quite immersed in what\u2019s happening,\nit\u2019s not the kind of play where the actors stand\nabout on stage quoting things, you really feel\nlike you\u2019re actually there.\nPranav: And mine\u2019s rather different, it looks at\nthe creation of the first atomic bomb, but looking at it from the side of the scientists involved,\nespecially focussing on Einstein, Oppenheimer\nand Szilard; exploring their motivations and\nconsequently how they felt when they heard of\nthe use of the bomb. So it\u2019s quite a dark play,\nit\u2019s very dramatic\u2026 It sheds a new light on the\nscientists if you\u2019ve never thought about what\nthat felt like before.\nShamini: Yeah, we tend to lose sight of the fact\nthat science occurs in a social context, that scientists are real humans. Also in this particular\ncase that science can actually have such a huge\nimpact on the world and on people\u2019s lives.\nWhat made you want to start writing to\nbegin with?\nShamini: It was definitely over a year ago\nwhen I started writing down some of the ideas\nwith a plan to write something. I suppose when\nyou\u2019re around drama a lot, and involved in lots\nof artistic things, you get these bits of inspiration and you think, \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be great if I\ncould kind of cram all these things together and\ncreate something to direct myself.\u201d\nGilead: The reason I wanted to do it, and the\nbig challenge for me, is that I\u2019m not musically\ntalented in any way but I have a tremendous\namount of admiration for people who are. So I\nwanted to try and immerse myself in that sort\nof environment with people who know music\nand knew what they\u2019re talking about, and not\nto be so scared of it.\nShamini: But before you started this project\nyou\u2019d been rewriting the lyrics of songs hadn\u2019t\nyou? You knew all about it\u2026\nGilead: Yes, that\u2019s true; sad and alone in my\nroom... Shamini\u2019s kind enough to conjure up\nthe image of a misspent youth rewriting lyrics\nto songs, which is actually largely true to life. I\nknew I wanted to do this and about a year ago it\noccurred to me to actually see if this could fly.\nSo I started writing a couple of songs, and then\nover the course of the year, I built a plot around\nit and suddenly it\u2019s all become real.\nPranav: My inspiration actually all came\nfrom having a discussion with a friend about\npeople who\u2019ve changed the world in whatever\nway, and the regulars came up; Mahatma Gandhi, Hitler, Martin Luther King, and then my\nfriend mentioned Albert Einstein. Obviously, I\nagreed about the importance of E = mc2\nbut he\nsaid he\u2019d actually been referring to the atomic\nbomb. I\u2019ve always had ideas about writing\nin my head, and they\u2019ve always come in and\ngone out again, but this idea sort of stuck, so I\nthought I\u2019d better do something about it. This is\nthe first thing I\u2019ve tried to write, but I just tried\nwriting it down and kept going and going and it\nreally seemed to come together.\nShamini: Mine was eventually kick-started\nwhen I\u2019d written the first act and it had taken\nme ages because I really wanted it to work. But\nhaving written it, I suddenly realised that the\ndramatic society were having their meeting in\nwhich they invite you to come and propose a\nplay that week. I realised that I only had a first\nact so I sat down for a day and scribbled out a\nreally rather brief and very bad second act\u2026\nGilead: Oh no, it wasn\u2019t bad...\nShamini: I\u2019ve rewritten it since; it\u2019s good now!\nBut obviously the first draft was about five seconds of \u201cand then the play ends and everything\ngets tied up and that\u2019s the end\u201d. I proposed it\nentangleable web of connections between the subsets of each camp. But essentially it comes down to\nthe fight between Classical Liberalism: something\na little akin to light Anarchism where the rights and\nfreedoms of the individual are key and government\nmust be strictly limited and decentralised; versus\nFederalism which is the opposite: social fairness,\ninternational security and economic progression ensured by the presence of a strong central authority.\nAyn Rand\u2019s Atlas Shrugged is infamous for its association with the American new right and the politics of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. It is\nalso often held up as a bible of the modern variant\nof Liberalism: Libertarianism. But wait, Margaret\nThatcher was the \u201cbad guy\u201d right? She wanted to\nnationalise the NHS and I heard she drank the blood\nof northern children to keep her going. But you said\nit was like Anarchism and that\u2019s cool isn\u2019t it?\nAtlas Shrugged is a passionate extolment of the\nrights of the individual and for that a fascinating\nread. It disassembles what we in a country with as\ncentral a welfare state as the UK has would generally consider the cruel heartless views of the money\nhungry and builds them up as instead a burning human desire to be free. In doing so, it changes your\nperspective and opens you up to the on-going political discussion.\nAs a story it is fiction, a grand Old-Testament\nstyle drama envisioning the end of the world. Set\nin a subtlety altered 1950\u2019s America as New York\nrots from the inside out and a mysterious force is\n\u2018stealing\u2019 the key figures of science and industry.\nAyn Rand writes extremely powerfully and to read it\nreally is a very enjoyable story.\nThe conflict between security and freedom is\ncompletely central to personal, moral and political\nphilosophy. And for that reason, despite its biblical\nlength (nearly 1300 pages), I would highly recommend this.\nGilead Amit \u2013 Imperial Collage, 13th Dec. Shamini Bundell \u2013 The Dark Side, 8th Dec.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 19\nFriday 26 November 2010\nHassan Joudi assesses the coalition\u2019s new openness website\nA gimmick or new era of transparency?\nE\narlier this month, David\nCameron launched a new\ngovernment \u201ctransparency\u201d\nwebsite as part of his Big\nSociety plans for Britain.\nVisitors to www.number10.gov.uk/\ntransparency will be welcomed by three\nlive items: \u201cBusiness plans\u201d, \u201cWho does\nwhat in Whitehall\u201d and \u201cWho ministers\nare meeting.\u201d The opening sentence\nboldly declares \u201cWe want to be the most\nopen and transparent government in the\nworld.\u201d\nEver since the MPs expenses scandal\nin 2009, \u201cchanging politics\u201d or \u201ccleaning up Westminster\u201d have become oft-repeated phrases. The episode has been\ndisastrous for Britain\u2019s confidence in its\nelected representatives. But could this\n\u201ctransparency\u201d website initiative start to\nturn back the tide?\nIt can be argued Britain is an already\nextremely transparent nation, with websites like www.TheyWorkForYou.com\nthat present what each and every MP\nsays in parliamentary debates, their voting record and expenses claimed. It\nworks by employing open source code\nto aggregate the content from Hansard,\nthe official record of debates in the\nHouses of Parliament.\nIn addition, www.Data.gov.uk is a\ngovernment initiative launched in January 2010, designed to link data published by public bodies in one place,\nranging from local police crime statistics to money spent by NHS Primary\nCare Trusts.\nAway from the web, legislation like\nthe Freedom of Information Act 2000\nintroduced by the previous Labour government (came into force in 2005) has\narguably brought a whole new level of\ntransparency to British politics. It allows\nmembers of the public and businesses to\nrequest access to information held by\ncertain public authorities which is not\nfreely available, and despite the numerous exemption clauses the act contains,\nhas exposed many revealing facts that\nwere formally state secrets. After all,\nthe MPs expenses scandal began from a\nFOIA request by a journalist in February 2008.\nSo is this new government \u201ctransparency\u201d website anything new? Perhaps\nthe business plans are. The publishing\nof \u201cbusiness plans\u201d for all government\ndepartments represents the fulfilling of\na Conservative Party manifesto promise.\nThis was broadly to \u201cpublish data so the\npublic can hold government to account.\u201d\nThis was among many others Big Society ideas expounded by the Conservative Party in the run up to the May 2010\ngeneral election, including a Big Society\nBank to provide finance to charities and\nNGOs, and a National Citizen Service\nfor 16 year olds.\n\u201cWe\u2019re shining a bright light of transparency on everything government\ndoes,\u201d was among David Cameron\u2019s\ncarefully crafted sound bites in the website launch speech. The new standards\nfor transparency the government has set\nitself are certainly greater than anything\never seen before in the UK. To select a\nfew examples, from now on all central\ngovernment spending above \u00a325,000 is\nto be published, as are all tender documents for government contracts over\n\u00a310,000 and the organograms (organ-isational charts) of each department in\na common format. The Financial Times\ndescribed the coalition as \u201ccreating a\nrod for its own back.\u201d Moreover, there\nare further transparency standards to be\nintroduced in January 2011, including\nthe publication of all local government\nspending above \u00a3500.\nIt is hoped that the mass of published\ndata will spur enterprising NGOs, think-tanks, charities and companies to take\nhold of this data and use it, manipulate it\nand campaign for the change they want\ngovernment to do. In theory, all these\nprivate institutions will be engaged in\nthe public debate, whilst also pressuring for high standards of performance in\npublic services.\nViewing Britain on the global stage,\nthe country is apparently the 20th least\ncorrupt nation. This is according to\nthe 2010 CPI (Corruption Perceptions\nIndex), a ranking of all 178 countries\nin the world produced every year by\nTransparency International, a respected\nBerlin-based NGO that campaigns to\nreduce levels of public sector corrup-tion.\nOn the About Us page of TheyWorkForYou, their stated aim is to help bridge\nthe gap between we the people, and our\nMPs, in the belief that \u201cthere is little\nwrong with Parliament that a healthy\nmixture of transparency and public engagement won\u2019t fix.\u201d In a way, this new\n\u201ctransparency\u201d website is perhaps trying\nto extend this principle from Parliament\nto government departments and the civil\nservice too.\nJust a few week\u2019s old, an optimistic\nview of this new \u201ctransparency\u201d website\nwould be to call it a revolution, a new\nera in British politics and bringing governance into the 21st century. Pessimists\nwould usher it away as nothing new, just\nmore data on top of the thousands of\nPDFs already published on government\ndepartment websites, or a copy of Labour\u2019s Public Service Agreements under\na different name. But still in its infancy,\nonly time will tell how useful a resource\nwww.number10.gov.uk/transparency\nwill become.\nLast Tuesday IC Debating Society, Israeli Society and Palestinian Society\ncollaborated, bringing together four\nprominent speakers to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict under the title:\n\u201cThe Debate for Peace\u201d.\nIn his closing remarks, Dan Judelson,\nformer chair of Jews for Justice for Palestinians, echoed the feelings of many in\nthe room by describing the event as \u201cone\nof the most good-natured discussions\nI\u2019ve ever had on the subject.\u201d While such\ndebates often tend to regress into partisan heckling, Tuesday\u2019s event managed,\nfor the most part, to develop a more mature dialogue. In addition to the speak-ers, the organisers are to thank for this\nwho, anticipating the difficulties of such\nan event, took steps to ensure the format\nwas as non-adversarial as possible.\nMr. Judelson was joined by Ran Gidor\nof the Israeli embassy in London, Ghada\nKarmi of the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies and Joel Braunold of OneVoice, a movement working towards a\npeaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nUnsurprisingly, the major issues such\nas settlements, security and refugees\nfeatured prominently. Mr. Braunold\nlamented that \u201cat the moment all Palestinians can see is settlements expanding.\u201d But Mr. Gidor countered these\narguments, referring to past experience\nwith disengagement in Gaza and stating:\n\u201cNo Israeli government which is democratically elected is going to voluntarily\ncommit political suicide by evacuating\nthe settlements without getting a peace\ntreaty in return.\u201d\nOn the subject of occupation, Mr.\nBraunold said near the beginning of the\ndebate: \u201cIsrael will not enjoy security as\nlong as it is occupying the Palestinians.\nIt cannot.\u201d Israeli security \u2013 an issue\nmany of her citizens feel very strongly\nabout \u2013 was raised on a number of oc-casions. Mr. Braunold maintained that\noccupation and security were \u201ctwo sides\nof the same coin.\u201d And in his closing\nremarks, Mr. Gidor stated plainly: \u201coccupation is wrong.\u201d\nThe debate covered issues too numerous and too complex to cover adequately in this space. To name but a few:\nthe power asymmetry between the two\nsides, the role of the United States in the\npeace process and the plausibility of a\nsingle-state solution. This is not, and nor\nshould it be, a comprehensive report of\nthe event; you just \u201chad to be there.\u201d\nAt the start of the discussion, Mr. Judelson stressed the importance of people\nputting their individual narratives aside\nin order to make progress towards a\nworkable compromise. However, as the\ndebate wore on, sectarian disputes over\nhistory, from both sides, started to take\nhold.

There\nwas a fair amount of \u201cpoint scoring\u201d\nfrom both sides; but there was also a\ngood deal of real, honest, constructive\ndialogue; dialogue aimed at a lasting\npeace agreement, rather than a temporary feeling of moral superiority.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 26 November 2010 5\nNEWS\nOn Monday the Public Awareness of\nScience and Engineering organisation,\nPAWS, held The European Science TV\nand New Media Awards Evening at the\nprestigious Institute of Engineering and\nTechnology (IET). A fitting location to\ncelebrate science in the media, as the\nIET was once home to the BBC many\nyears ago! This is the first year which\nhas seen the celebration of science in TV\nand New Media throughout Europe. The\nawards recognised a variety of countries\nfor documentaries, general programming and new media, as well as more\nunusual categories such as science in TV\ndrama.\nThe evening was a celebration of science in media, but highlighted some\nimportant points that those involved\nin science at Imperial should take note\nof. Susan Rae, voice of Radio 4\u2019s news\nfacilitated the evening and highlighted\nthat the awards were presented to those\nwho \u201cbring daunting science and technology to light.\u201d This was echoed by Dr\nMike Short, Director of the IET. He noted that over the last two decades science\nhave developed at a phenomenal rate,\nto the point where people cannot keep\nup. There is always a constant need to\ncommunicate science. But it seems that\npeople from different walks of life, from\nresearchers to broadcasters, have vastly\ndifferent views on who should communicate science, and how that communication should take place.\nProfessor Ann Dowling, from the University of Cambridge and keynote speaker of the evening, highlighted the importance of science in society. \u201cChoices\n[about science and technology] are too\nimportant to leave to engineers and scientists alone.\u201d She emphasised the need\nfor more dialogue between scientists and\nthe public, and suggested that increased\nobjectivity could be obtained on science\npolicies if everyone were more involved\nin the decision making process. The\nchallenge for any scientist is therefore\nto find a way to convey the complexity\nof their science without undermining\nthe fact that they can make a considerable difference to the world. Professor Dowling maintained that \u201cscience\nand engineering communication should\nremain a priority for the considerable\nfuture.\u201d Science is undoubtedly increasingly prevalent in society. Professor\nDowling\u2019s views highlight the views of\nmany; that present and future scientists\nwill need to find a way to communicate\ntheir science, or work with those that\ncan do that for them.\nThe second keynote speaker, Andrew\nCohen, head of BBC science, noted\nthat earlier this year \u201c[science broad-casting] started to get noticed in a way\nthat [the BBC] were not used to.\u201d This\nwas heavily linked in with the public\u2019s\nreception of the \u2018Wonders of the Solar\nSystem\u2019 series, and the now phenomenally popular ex D:RREAM keyboard\nplayer and physicist Dr Brain Cox. Mr\nCohen praised Brian Cox with injecting romance and emotion into science\nbroadcasting. As any researcher knows,\ndespite a relationship with your research\nthat can sometimes fall rather on the\nhate side of love-hate, you would not be\ndoing it unless you had strong emotions\nabout the subject, so it is interesting to\nsee this recognised.\nMr Cohen also highlighted the importance of finding different methods\nof communicating science to difference\naudiences. There seems to be an overwhelming push to have more researchers communicating with the public, either directly or through media outlets.\nHowever, this push is coming from\nbroadcasters and large organisations,\nnot the researchers themselves. When\nbudgets are being cut and researchers\nare being forced to do even more in the\nsame amount of time; can they really\nfind the time to increase their dialogue\nwith the public, and do it in a number of\ndifferent ways?\nOne of the special awards at the evening was for \u201cthe best presentation of,\nor by, a woman in science and engineering\u201d. It is well documented that there are\nfewer women participating in science,\nand that is certainly still true. This is also\nthe case across the media, and I wonder\nwhether we shouldn\u2019t be doing more to\naddress this.\n\u201cI think everyone in all walks of life\nshould have certain mental objectives.\nAnd one of them should be are there\nenough women on your panels and on\nCelebrating science in media\nPhoto by Lizzie Crouch\nAn evening of awards and discussion on the challenge of communication science\nLizzie Crouch\nprogrammes,\u201d explained Andrew Millington, director of the awards. \u201cThere\nis a big gender issue that needs to be\naddressed. If you do comparisons with\nother countries, for example in Italy\nthere are? 42%, or about that, of physics undergraduates that are women.\nThat\u2019s well above what that is [in the\nUK]. There were three reasons that were\nidentified. One of them is that they specialise later [at school], at 19. Two is\nthat physics is seen as part of culture in\nItaly, going back to Gallileo, Leonardo\nand so on. And three, they get support in\nthe home. It isn\u2019t seen as something that\na girl shouldn\u2019t be doing. Now all those\nthree things aren\u2019t the same here and\nI\u2019m a little surprised that people haven\u2019t\nbeen taking an international comparison\nand worked on it.\u201d\nThe BBC and the UK was well represented in almost all categories but notably absent from one; science and technology in TV drama. The representative\nwho presented the award even highlighted this before presenting the award, \u201cIt\u2019s\na bit sad that the UK isn\u2019t represented.\nWhy aren\u2019t we getting more funding\nand more commitment from the commissioners [in the UK] for science and\ntechnology in TV drama?\u201d\nAndrew Millington explained that one\nof the objectives of the evening was in\nfact to highlight the potential for science in TV drama. He explained that it\nis currently an area which is massively\nunderrepresented. Drama is classed under arts, and this label automatically implies a socially imposed separation from\nscience and technology. Where science\nhas featured in drama previously, it has\nmainly taken the form of science fiction.\nAndrew explained that \u201cscience fiction\nwas born in an era where science wasn\u2019t\nso dominant,\u201d and now that \u2018real\u2019 science is much more dominant it might be\neasier to incorporate. However, it is still\na massive challenge for writers. Andrew\ngave an example of a BBC drama writer\nwho had explained the depth of research\nhe had to do. \u201cIt took him four years,\nfrom starting research right up to the end\nof the production.\u201d\nI suggested that people are scared of\ntaking on that challenge. Andrew agreed\nstrongly, \u201cFrom two points of view.\nFirstly, writers don\u2019t think the commissioners will respond to it and two because they themselves have got to do a\nlot of work for which initially they don\u2019t\nget paid. So there are several barriers to\novercome. We find almost all arts people recognise intellectually that science\nis becoming more and more dominant\nbut they haven\u2019t internalised it emotionally if you like.\u201d\nThese awards celebrating science in\nthe media may be one step in addressing\nscience\u2019s separation from society, but\nthere are others. I wrote recently about\nthe phenomenon that is Zooniverse, a\ncitizen science project which invites\nthe public to participate in scientific research online. Julian Phillips mentioned\nthat projects such as this could be a way\nof enticing the lay public\u2019s interest but\nwith the benefit of generating actual\nscientific data; Zooniverse has over a\ndozen scientific papers to its name so\nfar. The BBC is doing something similar\nwith LabUK, which \u201charnesses a huge\naudience that academics might not be\nable to.\u201d Earlier this year a Nature paper\nwas published off the back of a huge LabUK study which famously showed that\nbrain training games don\u2019t work.\nHowever, as a final thought, when Andrew Cohen was asked whether he felt\nthe pressure of representing all areas of\nscience, he simply said, \u201cI represent the\nviewers.\u201d The aspects of science the license fee payers are already interested\nin are the ones that get broadcast. So as,\nwell as finding the time and best way\nto introduce dialogue between the science community and the public, it turns\nout it\u2019s also a competition to get their\nattention!\n\u201cWhen budgets are being cut can researchers really find the time to increase their dialogue with the public, and do it in a number\nof different ways?\u201d\nFrom left: Andrew Cohen, Professor Ann Dowling, Susan Rae, Dr Tara Shears, Julian Phillips, Professor Chris Mason\n\n"

The\nlonely sheep live on the island of Hirta, home to a\ndiverse ecosystem of sheep and vegetation. Lead\nresearcher, Tim Coulson from Imperial College, said\nthat it is \u201ctoo early to say if, in 100 years, we will\nhave...pocket-sized sheep.\u201d Let\u2019s hope so.\nSmolin, a brilliant theoretical physicist himself, attempts in this book to provide a concise and specific tour of modern physics and its complexities.\nCreating a link between the somewhat unfathomable different areas of physics, he explains how the\ndiscipline has progressed from Einstein through to\nquantum mechanics and the notorious string theory.\nSmolin is sharp and provocative in his writing. He\ndoes not simply put forward ideas, but also questions them and their proponents. He also raises\nsome interesting economic and political implications caused by physics research. This is the most\nrefreshing attribute of the book; it is not simply an\n\u2018ode to physics\u2019 as so many popular science book\nare, but rather a critical analysis of the state of the\nscience and the bold theories and claims that are\nmade about it. Smolin is engaging and entertaining,\nleaving us with a greater insight into how the theoretical physicist thinks. Katya-Yani Vyas\nStudents with \u2018Parasight\u2019\nVictoria Bignet\nThe science behind the iGem team\u2019s successful project\nMIT hosts an annual undergraduate Synthetic\nBiology competition called iGEM (Interna-tional Genetically Engineered Machine), aiming for each university team to build biological\nsystems and operate them in living cells. Imperial made an outstanding performance and\nlanded fourth on the podium out of a total of\nsome 129 participating universities.\nThe Imperial team built their project on bio-sensors. Sensors developed so far require hours\nor weeks of waiting before a detectable output\nis produced, jeopardizing the product\u2019s application on the field. Current designs also only\nrespond to a small range of basic inputs and\nlack flexibility in input/output modulation.\nFor the detection target, the Imperial College\nteam wanted something with a strong health\nimpact. They envisioned a cheap, safe and fast\nsensor that could detect the presence of a range\nof human parasites in water, which would indicate to people in developing countries whether\nthe water is safe to drink/touch \u2013 hence the\nproject\u2019s name \u201cParasight\u201d! The IC team focused on the schistosoma parasite, a neglected\ntropical disease (NTD) which affects 200 million people worldwide, second only to malaria\nin severity.\nThey engineered a system which allows for\nfast detection of a range of parasites, and may\nalso be used as an environmental tool for mapping parasite spread. Synthetically modified\nBacillus subtilis, a harmless gram positive soil\nbacterium, was used to give a clear colour read-Friday 26 November 2010\nYou won\u2019t believe it...\nout upon detection of the waterborne parasites.\nThe team designed the project in three\nmodules. Their detection module constitutes\na brand new approach, exploiting parasite release of elastase to penetrate host skin. They\nsynthesised a novel protein bound to B. subtilis cell surface, with a protruding signalling\npeptide attached via a protease cleavage site.\nWhen the parasite protease comes along, the\nsignal peptide is released and activates the\nsignalling module. To transduce the signal,\nthe team used a quorum sensing system which\nthey extracted from Streptococcus pneumoni-nae and transplanted into B. subtilis. Activation of this classic two-component system induces gene-transcription and triggers the fast\nresponse module.\nCercaria (larval stage) is the most useful lifecycle stage of Schistosoma to target, as it would\nprevent the disease altogether. Cercariae are\ncommon in water, but their spatiotemporal appearance is unpredictable. With this detection\nmethod, locals or NGOs could easily check the\nwater to see if it is infected.\nThe project\u2019s design was based on the pre-infection release of elastase by cercariae, without which they would be unable to progress\nin their life-cycle. The cell-surface protein\nof B. subtilis has three components: an auto-inducing peptide (AIP), a linker peptide and a\ncell-wall binding protein (CWB). In order to\nactivate signal transduction, the AIP must be\ncleaved, i.e. it cannot access its specific receptor if still attached to the surface protein.\nCleavage by elastase releases the sequestered\nintercellular quorum sensing signal. It is the\nlinker which confers specificity to the surface\nprotein; the elastase recognises a four amino-acid sequence (SWPL) included in the linker.\nThe latter is anchored to the cell-wall by an\nisolated domain from the LytC protein, native\nto B. subtilis.\nCercariae do not readily release elastase in\nthe water. They need to detect human lipids in\nambient temperatures of around 37\u00b0C. However, cercarial elastase is a crucial protease for\nsuccessful infection, and is thus guaranteed to\nbe released assuming these conditions.\nWhile an elastase has cleaved a protein link-er, the team designed a resulting downstream\nsignalling pathway. The so-called \u2018ComCDE\u2019\nsystem of genes in S. pneumoniae signals via\na linear AIP and uses a two-component signal\ntransduction system. The ComC gene-product\nis CSP1 (competence-stimulating peptide-1)\nwhich is the system\u2019s AIP. CSP-1 is exported\nout of the cell and is detected by the CWB \u2013\nsensory histidine kinase ComD. The kinase\nthen activates response regulator ComE. This\ntranscription factor then binds to its specific\ntarget gene to induce transcription; the team\nsynthetically set the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV)\nprotease gene as target by adding a ComE binding site upstream from it.\nPrevious trials have been based on transcrip-tion-translation of a specific reporter molecule\n(e.g. GFP) which is time-consuming and might\nneed sophisticated equipment for detection.\nThis system is not only revolutionarily fast but\nit involves the expression of a protease which\nSynthetically modified Bacillus subtilis was used to give a clear colour readout upon detection of the waterborne parasites\n\n"

The Cam, a mere\nstream compared with the might of\nthe Thames tideway, gave confidence\nto the competitors at least for a good\nresult.\nWith all parts of the boat successfully\nremembered and reassembled this was\nit, time to get on the water and meander\nto the start line. A cox down, the Men\u2019s\nB boat drafted in the help of a prepubes-cent Westminster school boy, with little\nto no coxing experience.\nPaddling up to the start it was discovered that 2500m wasn\u2019t as far as\nit sounded and some of the competition was definitely beatable. With all\nthree crews safely at the start line, Alex\n\u2018Crabz\u2019 Quigley produced a powerful\nspeech, full of Cambridge bitterness to\nrally the team for the race. Crew t-shirts\nadorned, the race was on.\nThe Men\u2019s Student Novice Boat A\nwas away, powering through the first\nhundred metres, feeling good. Suddenly, the IC Novice Boat B could be seen\ncareering diagonally across an almost\nstraight section of river towards the only\ntree on the course. Shouts from bowman Reuben \u2018Cameron\u2019 Hill to \u201cBACK\nIT DOWN\u201d were too late to evade the\ninevitable. Colliding with the only tree\nsticking out of the bank, their race was\nover after only ten strokes. Our school\nboy friend would soon be receiving numerous death threats.\nBack in the race Men\u2019s A steamed\nthrough the first 1000km with great skill\nand power. Valuable time was unfortunately lost in the second 1000km due\nto strokeman Tommy \u2018pedo-rapist-trainers\u2019 Hirst sliding straight off his runners\nowing to a previously mentioned issue\nwith his seat.\nFinishing fast and making up ground\non the team in front Men\u2019s Novice boat\nA came in a satisfying third position (15\nseconds off first )destroying all our London competition and leaving Cambridge\ngawping at the rowing talent they had\nrejected. Without seat issues, could first\nhave been theirs?\nMeanwhile the Woman\u2019s Novice Boat\nwere giving a master class in competitive rowing, streaking past the boat in\nfront in the final 1000m and pulling\nlengths ahead to obliterate the competition and post the fastest time in class, by\na large margin.\nAnyone would think they were trying\nto make a point: Imperial College does\naccept girls? No wait, Imperial Woman\u2019s Novices are a force to be reckoned\nwith.\nMen\u2019s Boat B gingerly made its way\ndown the course where eventually the\npressure on the vulnerable cox became\ntoo great, abandoning the crippled boat\nfor some poor excuse of needing to race\nin his own crew. Will \u2018Captain Sideburns\u2019 Blyth took control of the situation to avoid the boat disrupting the next\nrace, Tom \u2018lycra\u2019 Carpenter stepped in\nfor his coxing debut and with the help of\nstrokeman Hugh \u2018facial\u2019 O\u2019Connell the\nboat was successfully coxed the rest of\nthe way down the course and to safety.\nAt least the finish line was reached in\nthe end.\nThe Novice A boats set out again re-christened Men\u2019s Boat C and Woman\u2019s\nBoat B. Crashing boats again proved to\nbe the problem of the day with a boat\ncatching the bank and jack knifing\nacross the river right in front of the Men.\nThankfully with a more experienced\ncox, potential disaster was avoided.\nXavier \u2018pension\u2019 Lorrain and Tom \u2018blue\nshirt\u2019 McArdle et al put in a sterling\neffort in the final 500m to finish their\nsecond race of the day in style ahead of\na queue of other boats.\nThe woman once again showed what\nimperial can do with a fifth place finish\nfrom the second boat beating both Kings\nCollege boats and many Cambridge col-leges.\nAfter a few dozen more bananas, and\nthe longest discussion about lemonade\nand pimms in history, ICBC headed\nhome to celebrate their success in centurion drinking style.\nApparently the opening of metric was\npretty good too. What better way to end\na weekend than waking up to a glorious\nhangover.\nRowers cut their teeth on the Cam\nCharlotte Levin\nIC Fencing Women\u2019s first team visited\nOxford last weekend as a first part of\nBUCS Premier League South Division.\nIt was a weekend well spent, fencing\nagainst Oxford, Cambridge, King\u2019s College and Queen Mary and eventually returning with excellent results.\nFirst up on piste was the foil team,\nconsisting of Alice Mitchell, Hanna\nBryars and Outi Supponen. They literally danced their way through the four\nfirst matches, emphasising how strong\nthe team is and also building a comfortable margin for the other weapons. Past\nlunch time, weapons were switched and\nClare Harding replaced Alice for sabre.\nHaving good confidence from earlier\nyears and the successful morning, the ladies continued standing strong and barely even gave the other teams a chance\nto show what they had. Queen Mary did\nput up a tougher fight, but Imperial had\ntheir mind set on victory and rounded\noff nicely.\nCounting the score at the end of the\nday was a pure pleasure. It turned out\nthat the team had done so well that\nthree out of four matches already were\nwon, and very was required to win the\nlast one: 8 hits in total, in a match of\nfirst to 45. The night was spent without worrying, complimenting everyone\nfor the good performance and putting\nup goals for the next day. It was after\nall a competition, and what would it be\nwithout a challenge to strive for? The\naim was set as high as possible: leave\nOxford undefeated. It had never be\ndone before, and sometime had to be\nthe first one.\nArriving to the venue on Sunday\nmorning, Emily Bottle, Charlotte Levin\nand Alice warmed up to fence epee\nwhile the rest of the team got ready to\nsupport. Cambridge was the most demanding opponent, having been so over\nthe past years and hence building up a\nmental challenge as well. It was an even\nmatch throughout, the teams taking turn\nof being in the lead and sometimes seriously threatening the goal that had\nbeen set. Emily fenced the last part of\nthe match, and she got the rest of the\nteam standing on their toes before winning with a single hit, 45-44. The last\nmatch was fenced against Queen Mary,\na match that required more tactic con-sideration. Nevertheless, thanks to very\ngood team work, good estimations of\nindividual performances and of course\ngreat supporting, Charlotte was able to\nfinish the match at 45-40. It was a con-fident, proud and happy team returning\nto London.\nImperial\u2019s reliable and diverse attacking plays, which include cleverly named\nschemes like \u201cWurst\u201d or \u201cDagmar\u201d, and\nthe fact that the opponent goalkeeper\nhad only played handball twice in his\nlife helped to quickly turn the game\naround. The aggressive 5-1 defense interrupted UCL\u2019s attacks, forcing numerous turnovers, whereas on the other end\nof the court precise and fast passing set\nup the wing players to score easy goals\non several occasions. Midway through\nthe first half it became obvious that our\nopponent was lacking in coordination\nand variability, which mean that Imperial established a well-deserved 4-goal\nadvantage in the final minutes before the\ninterval.\nWith the comfortable advantage, and\nfully aware of their opponent\u2019s weak-nesses, Imperial players stepped up\ntheir game right away and increased\ntheir lead constantly throughout the\nsecond 30 minutes. UCL became increasingly and visibly frustrated, which\nwas indicated by many German and\nFrench swearwords being used on the\ncourt, and culminated in attempts to decapitate and mutilate the Eagles goalkeeper (who had an excellent 2nd half)\nfrom the penalty spot and the wing po-sitions. Severely unimpressed by their\nopponent\u2019s vulgar display of disap-pointment, the Imperial Eagles continued to exploit the turnovers and soared\nto a justified ten goal advantage at the\nend of the game.\nIt was a perfect and very encouraging\nstart to the season, which was elaborately celebrated in Metric, but no reason to\nbe complacent if the talented team wants\nto bring some silverware to London over\nthe course of the season.\nImperial overcome rivals\nThey just needed to push away and they would be in business!\n....Continued from back page\nImperial College Boat Club take hungover newbies rowing on a cold morning\n\n"

This week I introduce to you: Turbo Recordings.\nUnlike new boys on the scene Night Slugs,\nTurbo Recordings has been releasing music\nfor over a decade now. The label, founded in\n1998, is run by two brothers from Montreal;\nTiga and Thomas Sontag, and is widely\nconsidered one of the most influential labels\nin electronic music. Tiga is most commonly\nknown for his 2001 cover of Corey Hart\u2019s\n\u2018Sunglasses at Night\u2019 and his strange sense\nof humour, while Thomas (a.k.a.

This is not to say that Turbo Recordings\nhas become a one-trick pony. The exact opposite is true in fact. Sure the likes of the Dahlb\u00e4ck Brothers, Jori Hulkkonen and new boy\nGesaffelstein form a backbone familiarity to\nthe (now nearing 100) Turbo releases but output from Proxy, Boy 8-Bit and remix packages\ncovering the likes of Fever Ray and Chromeo\nmean that you never know what Turbo have got\nJoin in at: http://www.last.fm/group/Felix+Music\nTECHNO\nNONSENSE\nPt. 3: This week Simon\nHunter takes on the\nelectro & techno gods of\nTurbo Records\nlined up next.\nMany of you will probably be aware of\nProxy and his destroyer-of-worlds outlook to\nmaking music but if not check out \u20188000\u2019, a\nsong that somehow came to be my soundtrack\nto boating through the Amazon during the\nsummer.

All\nin all it was a brilliant performance, made only\nmore intense by the brilliant combination of\nstrobe lights and bulbs hanging from the stage.\nWithout a doubt, Dillinger is a barrel of fun\nfor the whole family.

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX Friday 26 november 2010 35\nYou can understand why I was distracted by Nemo and Dori... not!\nT\nhe 12th November, 4:48\npm: e-mail received asking\nme to review Mr Wing, a\nChinese restaurant in Earl\u2019s\nCourt.\n4:49 pm: Apprehension begins. Past\nexperiences of Chinese restaurants have\nnever been favorable for me, but that\nis a different story in itself. Of course,\nI could have given it to somebody else,\nbut a quick look on Mr Wing\u2019s website\nreassured me that this could finally be\nthe place to dampen my fears.\nAs I arrived I realized the Internet portrayal was spot-on: a modern, fresh and\nunique experience awaited me. Famous\nfor its food, foliage and jazz, Mr Wing\noffers a non-conventional feel to a popular Chinese cuisine. My excitement levels grew as I walked down the staircase,\npast a flowing waterfall, to be seated in\nthe sophisticated, chic, modern, ground-floor basement; a fish tank wall on one\nside of me, a tropical tree on the other.\nWow. The first restaurant I\u2019ve been to\nwhere I couldn\u2019t care less how long they\ntake to deliver my food, I had the \u2018fat\nfish\u2019 chasing Nemo and Dori around to\nkeep me occupied.\nBut then you stop. Stop and realise\nhow relaxing the atmosphere is, with\na warm piano touch from the jazz pia-nist, with a hint of waterfall in the background and low lighting directed at your\ntable. It was truly mesmerizing.\nWith a menu full of traditional Chinese dishes, this restaurant is not for\nthose who struggle with decision-making. Their unique dishes are based\non recipes from culinary capitals and\nregions across China, such as noodles\nfrom Beijing to hot spicy dishes from\nthe southwest. After finally deciding,\nthe horror on my face began at the realization I was about to receive a deep-end discovery of how to use chopsticks.\nLuckily, my steaming food, overpowering both the jazz band and the waterfall,\nwas enough to drag my attention away\nfrom Nemo and Dori, to realise that\nthankfully knifes and forks were pro-vided. Phew.\nThe Honeyed Barbeque Pork Ribs\n(\u00a37.50) provide succulent meat, which\nliterally falls off of the bone, leaving a\nlovely smoked barbeque after-taste. Accompanied with Thai prawn crackers\n(normal crackers with a uniquely spicy\nkick for \u00a33.50) and Mixed Vegetable\nLettuce Rolls (a warm mix of vegetables\nwrapped in a cold lettuce leaf, the Chinese answer to Fajitas for \u00a39.50), this\nleft my taste buds impatient for more.\nLuckily, the main courses did not dis-appoint. As cruel as it felt eating fish\nnext to a tropical fish tank, the Steamed\nSeabass Fillet with Ginger and Spring\nOnion (\u00a317) added a sweet, textured\nfeel to the tongue, complemented with\nthe fresh Spring Onion and Egg Fried\nRice (\u00a34.50). The jazz-muting, sizzling,\nIt\u2019s just love and peas at Hummus Bros Company\nThe Hummus Bros spoke, and we lis-tened. They said, rather politely, \u201cThink\noutside the sandwich\u201d and we did just\nthat; every bite was a savoury delight.\nOh yes, the offerings from Hummus\nBros were healthy and accommodating\nas well. Faithful readers of Felix would\nhave learnt from a previous issue that\nHummus is an Arabian dip made from\ngarbanzo beans (or chickpeas) blended\nwith lemon juice and tahini (sesame\nbutter). It is commonly served alongside pita bread as an appetizer. Hummus Bros plated the chickpeas puree\nas a base on which various condiments\nwere piled upon. Toppings ranged from\nchunky beef (for the carnivorous) to\nchickpeas or blended fava beans (for\nthe traditional) to guacamole (for the\npretentious). Radiant sprinkles of paprika and parsley provided the spicy\nand earthy flavour that made the humble\nhummus that much more vivid, and the\ndollop of tahini deepened the flavours\nwith a distinct nuttiness. If desired, a\nbit of garlic-infused lemon juice (in a\nconvenient squirt bottle) can be added to\nadd a slight tartness that complemented\nthe intensity of the toppings. The tasteful ensemble was served with a fluffy\n(and warm, thank goodness) pita bread.\nHummus Bros epitomizes honest fresh-ness, with hummus made daily, the quality far exceeds store bought variants.\nHummus Bros rewards students with\na 50% discount on sides and drinks with\nevery hummus dish. The Greek salad\ncame with crisp vegetable cubes topped\ngenerously with briny Feta cheese, a\nbrilliant companion to the hummus.\nWash everything down with the gently\nwarming spiced apple juice on a cold\nday or a refreshing mint and ginger lemonade for a warmer one. For those looking for a little candied ending to their\nGiving peas a chance, Hummus Bros layers toppings on the hummus\nMr Wing: The perfect treatment for Chinatown blues?\nJamie Williams visits his local Chinese gem in Earl\u2019s Court in hope of an alternative to the West End\nCantonese Fillet Steak with Spring Onion and Ginger (\u00a314.00) provided an\nunderstated tender meat mix with the\noverpowering ginger and undertone of\nonion. It was mouth-watering. Enough\nsaid.\nAfter a short break of listening to the\nold-meets-modern jazz pianist, who\nplays the likes of Lady Gaga and Taio\nCruz on Thursday, Friday and Saturday\nnights, and desperately trying to associate the Acappella with the song name\nChinhua Yap\n\u201cUnique dishes are\nbased on recipes\nfrom culinary capitals across China\u201d\nmeal, go for the Malabi \u2014 a petite milk\npudding served with an unapologetic\nand gloriously honeyed syrup.\nAlso impressive was the customis-ability offered, a mix of toppings can be\nchosen instead of just one and the pita\nbread can be swapped for carrot sticks\nor tortilla chips. Vegetarian-friendly options were aplenty and the serving staff\nwould offer suggestions and customiza-tions, if required.\nHonestly, I was surprised at how delicious the hummus was, simple and clean\ntasting with no gimmicks. The hummus\nwas fresh and smooth, toppings were\nfull-bodied and attendance was most\ndelightful. If you have been downing\none plate too many fish and chips and\nyour arteries scream for your good be-haviour, pay Hummus Bros a visit. It is\nnot creative to quote excessively, but I\nthink Hummus Bros\u2019T-shirts say it best,\n\u201cGive peas a chance.\u201d\nHummus Bros 88 Wardour Street W1F\n0TH. Take-away and delivery available.\nNearest tube: Oxford Circus.\n(Beware: it can get competitive to see\nwho\u2019s the quickest!), dessert definitely\nfelt natural. With a collection of Haagen-Daaz ice creams or sorbets, fresh\nfruit and hot toffee apple or banana\nslices (\u00a34.50); the dessert menu is short,\nbut plenty to be excited about. Not being\nable to decide which dessert to choose,\nthe perfect solution is to get them all,\nright? Now that was an interesting conversation with the waiter. The hot toffee\nbanana slices were definitely not what\nI was expecting, think sweet and sour\nchicken balls crossed with banana, but I\nam sure somebody out there likes them!\nBut what is sure, you cannot go wrong\nwith Haagen-Daaz. Personal favourites\nwere the Cookies & Cream and Belgian\nChocolate scoops. That, mixed with the\nrefreshing lemon sorbet, provided the\nperfect end to a fantastic evening.\nMr Wing can appeal to anybody, with\na range of prices and dishes and I definitely recommend it. What I will say is\nthat the prices may not be suitable for\na standard night out for every student\u2019s\npocket. But it is certainly something you\ncan book once-in-a-while for a fancy\ncelebratory meal and you will not be\ndisappointed. P.S.

For followers of Gil,\nthese 16 years remained a colourful time\nif not a prolific period of creativity, with\ncountless cancelled live outings and no-shows; Gil always seems to keep everyone on their toes.\nThis evening, thankfully Gil is pres-A sublime evening\nwith Gil Scott-Heron\nGil Scott-Heron gets the blues with Tytus Murphy, on a gloomy\nSunday in The Brixton Academy\nent and correct, arriving to a stage laid\nbare with minimal arrangements and a\nrapturous welcome from an eclectic demographic of eagerly-awaiting partici-pants; greeting the crowd affectionately\nwith light-hearted and hilarious mus-ings, remarking warmheartedly that he\nwas \u2018no stick in the mud\u2019 aiming to look\n\u2018intellectually involved\u2019 in the spoken\nword, but simply that the crowd had collective responsibility to enjoy ourselves,\nas he was sure to do.\nAs in voice, Gil Scott-Heron is striking in appearance: a wise head sits com-mandingly on a lanky frame, a gentle\nsmile that exposes battered and decayed\nteeth, brown pants pulled high, pale yellow and broad padded jacket draping\nlow and a grey scruffy fisherman\u2019s hat\nenclosing the tips of an illustrious sil-ver-tinged beard. Despite his frame and\nnow entering his 62nd year, Gil moves\nnimbly around the stage, alternating between keyboard and circular strolls of\nthe stage, feeding of the hypnotic jazz\nenthused percussion, sax and harmonica\nof his slick and tight backing band.\nGil begins his set by remarking wryly\nthat for those in the crowd who thought\nhe could not play the piano, \u2018you were\nright\u2019, much to the amusement of the\nenthusiastic and attentive crowd. He\nthen talks poetically about the battle of\nthe seasons before subtly morphing into\nthe melancholy \u2018Winter in America\u2019.\nOnly the bluesy lament of \u2018I\u2019ll take care\nof you\u2019 features from \u2018I\u2019m new here\u2019, a\ntrack in keeping with the atmosphere\nof the evening, where Gil ranged from\nscreaming with anguish, as during\nIf you want to share a\nmind-blowing playlist send\nit in to music.felix@gmail.\ncom\n\u2018The revolution will not be televised. The thing that\u2019s going to change\npeople, is something that nobody will ever be able to capture on film\u2019\n\u2018Work for Peace\u2019where he cried through\nhis throaty baritone \u2018I don\u2019t want hurt\nnobody\u2019 to peacefully conveying \u2018Your\ndaddy loves you\u2019 in a gentle reverb.\nSeemingly transfixed during the saxophonist\u2019s regular elegant interjections,\nGil slowly rocked back on his keyboard\nstool; head, beard and fisherman\u2019s hat\nswaying in the smoke. He is a blues pur-ist, obsessed with Coltrane et al. and his\nevident appreciation of his band\u2019s contributions reveals a youthful love of music that still burns brightly. Gil\u2019s voice\nis coarse in moments, grainy and harsh,\na far cry from the lush, soulful and distinctive voice of the 70s but it does not\ncause you to wince or flinch; instead\nthis broken voice adds depth and pain to\nthe cry of \u2018to turn your sick soul inside\nout, so that the world can watch you die\u2019\nmaking for an emotionally intense expe-rience.\nThe evening is not solely about the\nlonging, hurt and loss embodied in the\nblues but instead a musical journey traversing jazz, African rhythms and soul\nwith Gil contrasting the rawness of\nhis singing to jovial commentaries in\nbetween songs, making for an absorbing and enjoyable gig. Culminating in\narguably his magnus opus \u2018the bottle\u2019,\nwhich breaks this evening for a 10 minute congo drum solo of epic propor-tions, Gil rounds off a career-spanning\nset to a dedicated crowd who sincerely\nhope that it will not be another 16 years\nbefore we see Gil Scott-Heron in the\nflesh again, for Mr Scott-Heron did\npromise to bring better weather with\nhim next time.\nTinie Tempah\nDisc-Overy\nParlophone\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nThis California four-piece hail from a\nbeach town in Southern California, and\nsound exactly like you\u2019d expect them\nto. The single\u2019s a laid-back, reggae-tinged acoustic stoner rock number,\ndesigned for sprawling in the sand\nand chilling out to \u2013 Hell, it even features the obligatory bongo drums. Of\ncourse, this means your take on it on\na dank, grey November evening in the\npissing rain, is going to proceed roughly in line with the vividness of your\nimagination. It\u2019s a pleasant enough\ntrack \u2013 if you like your Jack Johnson\nor maybe even your Smash Mouth\nthere\u2019s plenty here to like, but none of\nthem are going to be losing sleep over\nthe competition.\nDuncan Casey\nDirty Heads\nLay Me Down\nExecutive Music Group\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nThis debut album, from the depths of\nthe South London ghetto (okay, middle-class Plumstead in Greenwich) starts\nwell, but trails off far too rapidly into\na succession of family-friendly pop-songs with just enough \u2018thug life\u2019 references to keep the rebellious 15-year-old target demographic interested. The\nfirst couple of tracks are pretty promising \u2013 dark, bassy numbers that you\ncould play in a club without any immediate shame. After that, though, the \u201clet\nme tell you about my designer things\u201d\nstereotypes begin, and the desperation\nto seem \u2018street\u2019 becomes palpable. In\nthe end, there\u2019s a genuine talent in there\nand the guy can rap, but toeing the fine\nline between mainstream Capital Radio respectability without degenerating\ninto a kind of bass-driven audio beige\nwas always going to be difficult, and\nthis doesn\u2019t manage it. It sounds exactly like what it is \u2013 hip-hop lite, or\nmaybe pop-hop. The kids will love it,\nbut you and I are probably too old for\nthis shit.\nDuncan Casey\nLocal Natives\nWho Knows Who Cares (S)\nInfectious Records\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nSounding like Fleet Foxes, Grizzly\nBear and Arcade Fire in a blender,\ntheir sound is extremely of the moment.\nVocal harmonies and string arrangements pushed to the foreground, results\nin occasional fantastic moments, but it\nnever really hits its stride.

    "content": "24 felix\nFRIDAY 26 november 2010\nComment Editor: Anna Perman\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe F-word. Not that one\nB\nefore you begin to read, please excuse\nthe crumbs.\nI love to snack while I write. I\u2019m not\npicky; from the humble chocolate di-gestive, perfectly married with a nice\ncup of tea; to a sandwich in the small hours, filled\nwith whatever in the fridge doesn\u2019t move when I\ntouch it; to an entire roast chicken with all the trim-mings, not forgetting the gravy.\nBut the point is that I love to cook. Every new\nrecipe that doesn\u2019t result in a trip to A&E is a success for me, another notch in my wooden spoon.\nHowever, I have been burned, and not just liter-ally. For example, the difference between a korma\nand an apocalyptic fire-storm when adding jalape\u00f1o\npeppers to a curry can be as small as a factor of\nten. Accidents like this are why most of my lower\nintestine is currently stored in a glass jar in Charing\nCross Hospital. But these aren\u2019t failures \u2013 they are\nlessons by which to improve my artistry.\nI have come to learn that, in order to make a good\nmeal, food must satisfy three principles.\nFirstly, the food must taste good. This can mean\nsolving lengthy equations to find the correct balance of different spices or it can be as simple as\nchoosing strawberry jam over Marmite when looking for something to spread on toast. (I don\u2019t want\nto start any arguments over this so I\u2019ll say it plainly.\nMarmite lovers, you are against nature. Seek professional help immediately...please?)\nSecondly, and perhaps most importantly effort\nmust go into the food. As a rule, I am totally against\nready-meals, after one particularly bad experience.\nI once tried curry from a can \u2013 to this day, I have no\nconclusive evidence that it wasn\u2019t dog food.\nThirdly, sugar, fat, calories; these all improve\na meal ten-fold. As a medical student I really\nshouldn\u2019t be advising that you inject cream into\nyour omelettes with a syringe so use half cream\ninstead. Again, this is obvious \u2013 how appetising is\na salad? Cottage cheese? Muesli? Are you salivating yet? No, I didn\u2019t think so. Now think about a\nplate full of bacon and egg, with beans, fried tomatoes and fried bread. Would you like a towel? I can\ncomfortably say without hyperbole that a full English breakfast cooked by my house\u2013mate will raise\nthe dead. It works wonders on a Monday morning\nhangover.\nWith these three tenets behind you, you cannot\ngo far wrong in the kitchen. However, the most\nimportant lesson I\u2019ve learnt is that the best meals\nare those you make yourself. This is something that\napplies not just in the kitchen, but in all rooms of\nthe house and beyond. Whatever life throws at you,\ndon\u2019t choose the gentle path and don\u2019t choose the\ndifficult path. Make your own path and see where\nit goes!\nAlso, make sure to wash up as you go.\nRhys Davies\nCOMMENT\nLetters\nTo the students of Imperial College London,\nI sincerely regret to hereby resign from the post\nof ICU Disabilities Officer.\nFor those of you who do not know me, my\nname is Nicola Hopkins and I was elected as\nImperial\u2019s first Union Disabilities Officer. I am\nalso completing my final year of an MSci in\nPhysics and have mobility issues of my own.\nI am sure that those of you who have met\nme will attest to the fact that I was eager to\nfulfil this role to the best of my abilities. Unfortunately, this role has expanded to the point\nwhere it is not possible to undertake as a voluntary part time role.\nBefore the new term began, I raised the issue of the lack of disabled access to the new\nUnion venues and that the disabled lift in the\nUnion Building is faulty and therefore unusable for disabled students. Neither issue has\nbeen resolved to date (8 weeks later) and I feel\nthat the lack of urgency over these matters is\ndisappointing, especially given that Imperial\u2019s\nDisability Equality Scheme states that all \u201crefurbishments have considered accessibility as a\nmajor priority\u201d.\nI am sure that the Union will eventually deem\nthat the expense at this juncture will be worth\nit to allow all members of the student body to\nactively participate in university life and sincerely hope that the appropriate adaptions will\nbe made in due course.\nAt the Student Union, we should be leading\nthe way in accessibility for students, not lagging behind the rest of the university.\nI cannot, with clear conscience, undertake a\nrole without giving it my absolute best and due\nto my very heavy academic workload and own\nhealth problems, I regret that I can no longer\ncontinue in this position.\nNicola Hopkins\nDear Sir\nAs I come from a certain country in southern\nEurope, I am already vexed enough by our\nleader, who appears often on every medium in\nItaly.\nI was taken aback when I saw him eyeing me\nfrom Felix; my disconcert grew when I saw\nthat the article condoned his practices.\nBerlusconi\u2019s values are antiquated, and it\nshows: other than the \u201cbetter to be like girls\u201d\nremark, he also said \u201cno\u201d to a \u201cmulticultural\nItaly\u201d and suggested that unemployed women\nmarry rich to escape poverty.\nThis reflects in his policies as well as giving\na certain image of Italy abroad. Italy consistently ranks poorly whenever women in politics\nare considered, as well as being behind in gay\nrights.\nIt is not an either/or choice whether to attack\nhis \u201cvalues\u201d or his policies. The main television news programs, the only way, for most\nItalians, to acquire news, barely mention his\nescapades. The pensioners, the religious, the\nentrepreneurs, the housewives who vote for\nhim often do not get to know of his crimes.\nWho will tell the public that the man who supports the Christian family sees 17 year olds and\nprostitutes, that he is associated with the mafia\nand drug rings? It\u2019s certainly not going to be\nhis media.\nWhile Italy isn\u2019t at the level of Greece and\nothers, it\u2019s not doing well. Italy\u2019s inherent economic strength allows it to remain afloat, but\nthis cannot last indefinitely. Italy\u2019s the last of\nthe pack when it comes to the great European\neconomies, and losing terrain. Berlusconi is\ndoing little to nothing to stop this.\nEven if the left is lethargic, there is a line between being useless and being harmful for the\ncountry, and Berlusconi crosses it.\nI think that if Italian politicians had had a bit\nmore bravery, Berlusconi would have never\nbeen allowed to get where he his today. They\nbargained with him and tolerated his nefarious\npresence.\nThey trusted the people to realise that he\u2019s\ncorrupt and dangerous, but obviously this did\nnot happen.\nThe argument that Italy would suffer without\nhim doesn\u2019t stand.\nBerlusconi is a dreadful politician and a\ndreadful person, and everyone should know\nthis.\nPietro Aronica\nVery fleetingly, at the age of nine I had a special interest in marrying Prince Harry. I chose\nHarry over William believing us to be better\nsuited if we were closer in age (6 years\nrather than 8). I then proceeded to foster\nsincere hopes of such a relationship in the\nfuture. My ideas of the wedding were Barbielike, i.e. there would be a carriage drawn by\nfour white horses. (At that time I didn\u2019t see\nBarbie for the tart she is; check out how\neasy she is when she encounters Ken in Toy\nStory 3, that ho bag.)\nHowever my fantasies were short-lived; I\nhad some intense Spice Girls dance routine\npractise to do. Ok that\u2019s not strictly true.\nI never got to do the dance routines. they\nwould never let \u201cthe Lesbian Monster\u201d have\na go. Honest to god, I did have this nickname at primary school; it\u2019s a long story\nso let\u2019s just say we frequently played Kisschase in the playground with the boys and I\nmust have got confused or something.\nSad ugly loner memories aside, Prince\nWilliam got engaged to Kate Middleton. So\nWHAT? Wouldn\u2019t you rather read about my\nfascinating life? Not that I gave you much\nchoice \u2013 see above. But with my rampant\negoism duly noted, I shall instead educate\nyou in spouse selection. Much more relevant\nthan the Royal Wedding. I hope you deem\nme qualified to do so despite my somewhat\nhomosexual experiences.\nLove makes people do silly things, like\nerr\u2026 oh crap, can\u2019t give an example from\nmy loveless personal life\u2026 Hold on, lemme\nthink.\nSo some poor Medic geezer falls head\nover heels for a hot Civenger (yes, that\u2019s\nright, interfaculty relations - doomed before\nthe off but hey, how\u2019s a fresher to know).\nThree minutes after texting her, he\u2019s yearning for a reply. When he hears nothing after\nanother minute he thinks his phone must\nhave been on silent (ignoring the fact that\nhis silent mode actually involves vibration).\nAfter checking his sound mode for the third\ntime, he envisions what she might be doing\nthat has prevented her perfectly formed fingers from typing a text back.\nAnd when, inevitably, his love is unrequited\n(an apparently painful experience that induces uncharacteristic song-writing tenden-cies) he keeps calling her but with claims\nof friendship. She accepts in order to avoid\nbeing thought a bitch, fully knowing his less\nthan innocent intentions. Thus she rips his\nheart to pieces indefinitely.\nSo, my marriage-material criteria: 1. They\nare in love with you. 2. You are not in love\nwith them. Look out for the ones that say\nthey\u2019d \u201cdo anything\u201d for you, those are the\nkeepers. That way, for the duration of your\nmarriage (a period which ideally takes up the\nmajority of your life), you can keep a clear\nhead whilst your partner is in the giddy and\ncrucially, malleable haze of love.\nBy Alexandra Nowbar\nAll this RoyalWedding tosh\nhas got me reminiscing...\n\u201cI once tried curry\nfrom a can \u2013 to\nthis day, I have no\nevidence it wasn\u2019t\ndog food\u201d\n\n"

It\u2019s been dubbed the\nfirst serious competitor to the\ncurrent king of the slates, Apple\u2019s\niPad. But does the the Galaxy Tab really have\nwhat it takes to top wishlists this Christmas\nor will the iPad reign supreme? Read on to\nfind out.\nThe Galaxy Tab has a clean design with the\nhallmarks of something that came out of Cupertino. The tablet features a 7-inch TFT touch-screen, which looks great: it\u2019s bright, gives\nclear and high-resolution imagery, and is re-sponsive. The screen is multi-touch enabled so\nyou can use gestures such as \u201cpinch to zoom\u201d\nfor web browsing, newspaper reading and photo viewing. The device has a hardware volume\nrocker, expandable memory using a micro-SD\ncard (up to 32GB), and a SIM card slot for 3G\nbrowsing and phone calls. A headphone socket\nis available for the bundled handsfree kit and a\ndocking port at the bottom of the device allows\nyou to connect it to your computer or a hardware keyboard.\nApple CEO Steve Jobs has publicly slated\n7-inch tablets, such as the Galaxy Tab, saying that they\u2019re not big enough to give a good\ntouchscreen tablet experience and that\u2019s why\nApple went for a 9.7-inch screen for the iPad.\nAs the surface area of the screen scales with the\nsquare of the diagonal length, the Galaxy Tab\nworks out to be half the size of the iPad. With\nboth products costing roughly the same, you\nmight ask why anyone would buy the smaller\ndevice. I\u2019d argue that a 7-inch tablet is better\nbecause it\u2019s more portable: it fits snugly into\nmy jeans pocket. The device is also lighter (the\nGalaxy Tab is 380g compared to 730g for the\niPad) so it\u2019s ideal for use on the go.\nSamsung are marketing the Tab as a portable multimedia and entertainment device.\nIt plays music in all the common formats and\nhigh definition video (up to 1080p), which\nlooks pretty good on the large screen even\nthough it\u2019s not HD itself. Applications are\nalso bundled for reading e-books, magazines\nand newspapers such as the Financial Times.\nGoogle Maps looks great and the free turn-by-turn GPS navigation is a winner on this\nscreen. The camera lets the Tab down though\n-- it\u2019s only 3 megapixels and takes pretty poor\nquality photos.\nOne of the interesting features of the Tab is\nthat it\u2019s a fully-functioning mobile phone too! I\nmust admit to getting some funny looks round\ncampus when I actually used it as a phone\u2026\nit could easily be something straight out of\na Dom Joly sketch! But in reality it\u2019s more\npractical to use the Tab as a phone than you\u2019d\nthink. Calls play out over the speakerphone by\ndefault (which limits the privacy of your con-versations) or through the bundled handsfree\nkit. Reception seemed pretty good as the device probably fits a bigger antenna \u2013 I was able\nto pick up signal in the basement of Blackett\nwhere my HTC Desire couldn\u2019t.\nPerformance-wise, the Tab was fairly smooth\nin operation and rarely lagged even with HD\nvideo or 3D games. The 4,000mAh battery\ngave me about two days of typical daily usage\nas an e-book reader, phone and the occasional game of Angry Birds during lectures. This\ncompares fairly well against the typical 3-6\nhours you get out of a laptop or a day with a\nsmartphone.\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab is a great\ndevice. It\u2019s halfway between a phone and a netbook \u2013 small enough to fit in your pocket and\nlarge enough to comfortably read magazines,\nbooks and watch videos. For these tasks the\nTab gives a real first-rate experience. But it\u2019s\nnot ideal for everything \u2013 if you want to write\nessays and lab reports on the go, you\u2019re better off with a netbook or Macbook Air. And if\nyou\u2019re unlikely to take your tablet out of the\nhouse, the iPad\u2019s larger screen could still be a\nwinner.\nFree App of the Week\niOS - Urbanspoon for iPhone\nEver been stuck for a place to eat?

Sounds like a great\nidea, but too much time is spent meandering,\nplodding through the muddled plot. Without\nthe split, the 150-minute running time would\nhave worked as a fast-paced, efficient road\nmovie but Yates seems to have saved the best\nscenes for the very last.\nThe film jumps from place to place and seems\nto lose its focus. There is an attempt to create\nconflict between the three of them, mostly involving Ron\u2019s jealousy towards Harry and Hermione\u2019s close friendship, but since these three\nhave been bound so tight in the previous films\nthe melodramatic fight between Harry and Ron\ndoes little to convince the audience of anything\ndrastic happening.\nRadcliffe, Grint and Watson have been in\nthese roles for a long time but even they cannot\nhandle this kind of rapid development. By con-trast, the vast amount of talent at Yates\u2019 disposal in his costars seems to go to waste. Starring\nin at least one Harry Potter film seems to be\na rite of passage for any British acting legend\nClassic Cinema\nDr Strangelove: Or How I Learnt to\nStop Worrying and Love the Bomb\nSurprisingly pertinent given that errant shells are flying over the world\u2019s highest concentration of military\nhardware on the border of Korea, Dr Strangelove is\nStanley Kubrick\u2019s 1964 dark comedy about what happens when the wrong people get their hands on The\nBomb.\nPeter Sellers initially takes on two, equally stressed-out characters. Firstly, as the second-in-command to\nan Air Squadron leader who has gone insane and\ndeployed his B-52 bomber fleet to launch a nuclear\nattack on the Russian mainland; and secondly as the\nPresident of the United States, who is summoned\nto his command room to impotently watch while his\ncountry accidently declares war from beneath him.\nIn the final act, he takes on a third character as the\neponymous Dr Strangelove: the eccentric scientific\nadviser to the government.\nThe decent into chaos and madness of the men in\ncharge of the country and military as they realise that\ntheir best-laid plans have collapsed around them mirrors the madness and chaos inherent in the logic of\nthe nuclear deterrent. The film was originally written\nas a completely serious drama, before the scriptwriters realised that the sheer ridiculousness of the situation best suited comedy.\nMeanwhile, on one of the bomber command B-52s\nsent erroneously to attack Russia, the crew get on\nwith their job. Led by the Slim Pickens, playing the\nTexan pilot, their grim determination to get the job\ndone while fearing about what it could all mean adds\nthe most human element to the story. However, it still\nallows for plenty of comedy, notably the much referenced moment when Pickens rodeo rides the bomb\ndown to the ground.\nDuring the final scene in the war room, when Dr\nStrangelove is giving his talk to the assembled Generals and Civil servants, no matter how many takes\nwere filmed (and with Kubrick, this was a notoriously\nlarge amount) there wasn\u2019t a single one without a\nmember of the cast laughing. When watching the one\nthat made it into the final cut, keep an eye open for\nthe Russian ambassador failing to suppress a huge\ngrin at Sellers\u2019 amazing turn as the crazy German.\nHilarious but serious, Dr Strangelove brilliantly captures the stupidity of it all.\nI think he\u2019s heading to the Lib Dem HQ...\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nMatt Allinson\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nYou know the drill: every Harry Potter sequel is\n\u201cdarker\u201d than its predecessors. Now that we\u2019re\nat the penultimate chapter, things must be getting very gloomy. Dumbledore is dead, Lord\nVoldemort\u2019s (Ralph Fiennes) power is growing,\nand the Ministry of Magic has been compromised by those controlled by Voldemort and his\nmerry band of wizards and witches. With nowhere and no one to turn to, the ambitious trio\nmust rely on each other and work together to\nfight evil.\nBut don\u2019t let the rather simple summary fool\nyou from just how complicated some of the crucial sub-plots can be. There are so many names,\nplaces, prophecies and spells that unless you\u2019ve\nbrushed up on your knowledge of the Harry\nPotter universe, chances are you will struggle\nto understand absolutely everything. Harry Potter films have always been criticised for stripping down its original material and keeping the\nand once again we get far-too-brief glimpses\nof outstanding actors making the most of their\nfive-minute screen times.\nA convoluted plot and unimpressive leading actors aside, there is much fun to be had in\nthe longest set-up of the franchise. The CGI is\nimpeccable and a couple of scenes will surely blow you away. Shame the rest of the film\ndoesn\u2019t quite live up to that standard but the\nmillions that will inevitably sit through this one\nshould get their pay off by next July, when the\nreal final part is expected to arrive.\nToo much time is spent\nmeandering through the\nmuddled plot\n\u201c\n\u201c\n\u201c\nto understand absolu\nto understand absolu\nter\nte films have alway\nve al\nr\nping down its origin\nn its\nToo much t\nToo much t\n\u201d\n\u201d\nit was to include\nit was to include\nugh the\nugh th\nStop complaining about student debt, I turn into a fucking werewolf\niCU Cinema - Inglourious Basterds\n\u00a33/\u00a34 for members/non-members\nTue 30th Nov. 6:30pm.\nUnion Concert Hall\nEVENTS\nDirector David Yates\nScreenwriter Steve Kloves, JK\nRowling (novel)\nCast Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert\nGrint, Emma Watson, Ralph\nFiennes\nHarry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows: Part 1\nJohn Park\nFriday 26 November 2010\nforced to hold the movie together pretty much\non their own.\nEmma Watson, it must be said, is the glue\nkeeping this section of the film together. Her\nacting has improved immensely since the first\nfilm and her portrayal of helplessness and betrayal is very convincing. Rupert Grint also\nfinally gets the chance to show us a different\nside to him as he is no longer simply the comic\nrelief. By contrast, Daniel Radcliffe is still, at\nmany points, quite wooden, and though we see\nglimpses of real emotion, some of the book\u2019s\nmore emotional scenes came across somewhat\nunderwhelming on screen.\nIt\u2019s difficult not to compare this film to HalfBlood Prince, as they were both directed by\nYates and yet are so different. Maybe it\u2019s the\nfact that because of the split, he has more time\nto focus on the little things, but he truly did an\namazing job with this film. The book-to-film\nadaptation was the best so far, even using a\nlot of dialogue word-for-word from the book.\nThere were only a couple of glaring errors,\nwhich can for the most part be forgiven. Alexander Desplat joins the crew as the composer,\nwhile Steve Kloves returns as the screenwriter\nfor the penultimate time. Together, they have\nproduced the best Harry Potter film so far and\nleave this fan anxiously waiting for July 15th,\nwhen the final movie will be released.\nLucia Podhorska\nBefore I start, I feel I should admit that I am a\ndie-hard Harry Potter fan, but I will do my best\nto leave out the unpunctuated, hysterical gushing love. Those who have not read the books\n\u2013 shame on you!\nI have by now read a few reactions to the\nmovie and a lot of people seem to be hung up\non the fact that there\u2019s so much time spent focusing on the trio\u2019s travels as they search for\nthe Horcruxes. As anyone who\u2019s read the book\nknows, this takes up a good chunk of the story\nso it makes sense to translate that to the screen.\nThere is still something going on the whole\ntime, as they make new discoveries, and it\u2019s\nnice seeing the core three together for greater\nlengths of time. We are also treated to some\ntruly beautiful shots of the British landscape.\nThe way the camera captures the scenes of the\nvast countryside with no one but Harry, Ron\nand Hermione in sight really drives home their\nisolation. Taken away from everything that is\nfamiliar, they are forced to rely on each other\nto pull through. It also poses a challenge to the\nthree young actors as for the first time they are\nEmma Watson\u2019s acting\nhas improved immensely\nand her portrayal of\nhelplessness is very\nconvincing\n\u201c\nses\nses\neir\neir\n\u201c\nrn into a fucking w\nEmma Wats\nEmma Wats\n\u201d\nmensely\nmensely\nl of\nl of\nvery\nery\nThe new Harry Potter film proves controversial\nGod help me it\u2019s bad...\nOutstanding...\n\n"

Iain is a former student of the college,\ngraduating in Chemical Engineering in 1985 and\nwas introduced to the students by Deputy Rector\nProf. Stephen Richardson who was his personal tutor during his time at Imperial.\nThe lecture covered a broad range of energy issues from the current BP view of world energy markets to the pathways to lower carbon energy technologies of the future.\nIn addressing the recent BP problems in the Gulf\nof Mexico, Iain shared his views on the likely impact\non the engineering and politics of future large energy projects.\nAs a senior member of BP\u2019s management team,\nIain spends time liaising with governments on energy policy and he gave students a fascinating insight\nin to the wider role of engineers in an increasingly\ncomplex energy world. After delivering his talk, Iain\npresented three awards to departmental graduate\nstudents Mahdi Sharifzadeh, Yiyun (Jessy) Zeng and\nFausto Ciotta, recognizing their research achievements then joined staff and students for refreshments before leaving immediately to fly to the USA.\nIan Swords\nDiscouraged by higher fees\nResults show majority of Imperial students would be discouraged from university by \u00a310,000 tuition fees\nWith protests going on up and down the coun-try, there is a great deal of anger about the government\u2019s plans for higher education. Almost\nall of us will be leaving university with some\ndebt, however this debt did not deter us from\ncoming to Imperial in the first place. However\na Union survey has shown that Imperial students are just as concerned by debt and rising\nfees as other students in the U.K. In light of the\nUnion\u2019s support for the Browne Review and\nthe government\u2019s proposals, is it being truly\nrepresentative of the majority of Imperial stu-dents?\nChances are, that during your GCSE\u2019s or ALevel\u2019s, university tuition fees was not a deal\nbreaker in your decision to go to university.\nHowever it is something we all think about at\nsome point, whether it is \u201cHow will I pay it\nback?\u201d \u201cWhere will the money come from?\u201d\n\u201cHow long will I be paying it back for?\u201d we\nare all in the same boat. Right now for a three-year course as a home student total tuition fees\nequal \u00a39,870, if fees increased, a total of almost \u00a330,000 would need to be paid back by\nthe student. For many students, this cost is\nnow an issue in deciding in whether going to\nuniversity is feasible. In the recent study carried out by Imperial before the Browne Review was released, 9.3% of Imperial students\nsaid that they felt they should have no debt on\nleaving university. 31.3%, the largest propor-tion, of students felt a debt of \u00a310,000-\u00a320,000\nwas reasonable. But only 5.3% thought debts\nabove \u00a330,000 would be reasonable. Under\nthe government\u2019s new system, a student on a\nfour-year course at Imperial would likely leave\nwith \u00a336,000 debt. It is therefore clear that although the vast majority of students agree that\nthey should contribute somewhat to the funding of their course (78.9% agreed that they\nshould contribute), they have strong reservations about the amount that they should have\nto contribute.\nUnion President Alex Kendall agreed that\nstudents \u201care worried about debt and it\u2019s something that we definitely need to tackle. we need\nto make an effort to translate the reality to students it\u2019s not the same as a normal debt. it\u2019s not\nlike credit card debt. it\u2019s the cost of a degree\nand somebody in the end has to pay for it.\u201d\nFurthermore students overwhelmingly rejected the idea of removing the caps on tuition\nfees, i.e. allowing universities to charge whatever they want for degrees. 86.5% of students\ntaking part in the study said they were against\nthe idea of an uncapped funding model which\nthe Browne Review recommended and Imperial College Union supports. A similarly large\nproportion of students, 78.9%, said they were\nagainst the graduate tax idea which is advocated by the N.U.S. and also the Labour leader\nEd Miliband. Alex Kendall commented, \u201cThe\ngraduate tax model doesn\u2019t link money to universities and doesn\u2019t give the universities an\nPriyantha Kulatilake\nincentive to develop. It is also worse for poorer\ngraduates because you have to start paying it\nimmediately, not at \u00a321,000 like the government\u2019s model.\u201d\nWhen asked whether an increase in fees\nwould discourage them from attending uni-versity, two-thirds of students agreed that it\nwould. However the data does not specify\nwhat size increase would deter students. Of\nthe third that said that they wouldn\u2019t be discouraged by higher fees in general, 54% still\nsaid that they would be discouraged by tuition\nfees of up to \u00a310,000. President Alex Kendall attempted to re-assure students saying,\n\u201cthe headline fee does include anything about\nbursaries or the fact that unless you go into a\nhigh-paying job, you won\u2019t have to pay back\nall that you owe.\u201d\nIt is clear that students are more concerned\nabout the current higher education situation\nthat previously thought. Given that fees at\nImperial are almost certainly going to rise to\n\u00a39,000 if the government\u2019s plans are enacted,\nthe assumption that Imperial students won\u2019t\nbe affected by the changes or don\u2019t care about\nthem is certainly challenged by the findings.\nThe results\n78.9% disagree with a graduate tax model\nOnly 5.3% believe that\nleaving university with\nmore than \u00a330,000 in\ndebt is reasonable\n86.5%\ndisagree that\nuniversities\nshould be able\nto charge what\nthey want i.e.\nsupport a cap\non fees\n\u201cIt is clear that students\nare more concerned\nthat previously thought.\nThe data challenges\nthe assumption that\nImperial students don\u2019t\ncare about the rise in\nfees proposed by the\ngovernment\u201d\nPhoto by Jacky Kwan\nIllustrations by Veronika McQuadeova\n\n"

    "content": "31\nfelix\nFILM\nFriday 26 November 2010\nQuentinTarantino:\nstyle over substance?\nNavid Nabijou\nprofiles the\ncontroversial\ndirector and\nhis latest work,\nInglourious Basterds\nO\nver the past two decades,\nfew directors have managed to excite such acclaim \u2013 and controversy\n\u2013 as Quentin Tarantino.\nHis work has sharply polarised critics,\nspawning a plethora of varied interpretations and deconstructions. Each new release is followed by a blaze of feverish\npublicity, and through all of this, Tarantino and his films remain something of\nan enigma.\nHis debut, the playful and gritty Reservoir Dogs, was in a certain sense a modest affair. Produced on a tiny budget and\nscreened in only a handful of cinemas,\nthe film went mostly unnoticed at first.\nIt does, however, set the precedent for\nall of Tarantino\u2019s later work: nonlinear\nnarratives, razor-sharp dialogue, profuse\nprofanity and a healthy dose of violence.\nIt\u2019s a heist film without a heist scene, a\nbleak tale of greed, loyalty and madness.\nTarantino\u2019s strongest asset is undoubtedly his treatment of dialogue. While\nmany directors regard dialogue simply\nas an inconvenient necessity, Tarantino\nrecognises and defends the importance\nof conversation for the sake of conver-sation. A considerable, and often unap-preciated, layer of characterisation is\nweaved into utterly mundane discussions about hamburgers and television.\nThe writing \u2013 at times incredibly real-istic, at times borderline fantastical \u2013 is\nconsistently incisive, witty and, above\nall, entertaining. And nowhere else is\nthis talent exhibited better than in the\nfilm many consider to be Tarantino\u2019s\nfinest: Pulp Fiction.\nPulp Fiction, released in 1994, is a\ndizzying ride through the underworld\nof Los Angeles. The audience is pulled\nback and forth through space and time,\nas the stories of the many colourful\ncharacters unfold in fragments. Hugely\ninfluential, it has been described as \u201cthe\nmost quotable movie of all time\u201d \u2013 and\nit\u2019s not hard to see why. The writing is\nsimply sublime, oozing with depth and\nsparkle.\nA thorough watching of a Tarantino\nfilm will make at least one thing appar-ent: this man loves movies \u2013 a lot. In his\nyouth he worked in a video rental store,\ngiving him the freedom to watch and\ndiscuss film for hours on end. The scope\nand depth of his expertise is formidable;\nhe has probably seen more movies than\nanyone else alive. This ingrained passion for, and connection with the world\nof cinema pervades the films he creates.\nTarantino, far from repudiating the influence of other filmmakers, relishes in\nit: his films are packed full of little nods\nto movie history. This can, however, go\ntoo far and he has often been criticised\nfor being derivative; his films have been\ndismissed by some as pastiches of the\npast instead of genuinely original works.\nAnother, related criticism is that his\nfilms favour style over substance. This\nis true to an extent; there certainly are\ndeeper, more profound films out there,\nbut, all in all, there is a good deal of substance present, even if we might find it\ndifficult to recognise. Take the \u201cSuperman monologue\u201d, a metaphorical musing on the human condition that builds\nto the climax of Tarantino\u2019s fourth mov-ie, Kill Bill. Which conveniently brings\nus back to the issue of style.\nKill Bill tells the story of The Bride, a\nformer assassin who embarks on an epic\njourney of revenge. Though containing\nall the standard Tarantino hallmarks,\nthe film\u2019s most distinguishing feature is\nits high aesthetics: it is a visual stunner\nfrom start to finish. Everything, be it a\nhospital ward, a Yakuza boss or a severed arm, drips with vibrancy and en-ergy. Let\u2019s be honest: when there\u2019s this\nmuch style, who cares about substance?\nPerhaps this argument might be answered by Tarantino\u2019s next film: Deathproof was released in 2007 to a lukewarm response and slinks in as one of\nhis lowest grossing movies. But despite\nthe disappointment of his fifth film,\nthere was a definite air of excitement in\nthe run up to his sixth. This project was\nparticularly special to him; he had been\ntalking about it for years. So it was to an\neager, hopeful audience that, in August\n2009, Inglourious Basterds was finally\nreleased, more than a decade after it was\nfirst conceived. Set in Nazi-occupied\nFrance, Inglourious Basterds, in keeping with tradition, consists of a number\nof interweaving storylines. Prettier than\nPulp Fiction, subtler than Kill Bill, it\ndraws together all the best features of\nhis cumulative body of work, resulting\nin one of his finest films to date.\nOne thread follows the Basterds, an\nAmerican guerrilla force dropped behind enemy lines and charged with\n\u201cdoing one thing, and one thing only:\nkilling Nazis.\u201d Running parallel to this\nwe have the striking Shosana Dreyfus,\na French Jew living undetected and operating a cinema in Paris. Finally, the\nconsummate SS Colonel Hans Landa,\nwhose performance earned the actor\nan Academy Award. A charismatic,\nshrewd, deeply unsettling fascination,\nLanda (described by Tarantino as \u201cone\nthe greatest character I will ever write\u201d)\nturns everything he touches into gold.\nInglourious Basterds is a return to\nwhat Tarantino does best, and he packs\nhis latest film full of fast-paced dialogue.\nThe atmosphere is electric; as the banter\nperpetually accelerates and intensifies,\nat a few points the suspense grows almost unbearable. His writing has certainly never been better. Stylistically, the\nfilm builds on the formula of Kill Bill,\nexploiting with finesse a number of contrasting styles, which blend seamlessly\nand make the film thoroughly enjoyable,\nif difficult to classify. In all, Inglourious\nBasterds is a treat; great to look at, listen\nto, and generally be entertained by.\nQuentin Tarantino is, in spite of his\ndetractors, a remarkable filmmaker.\nHis flair for sharp dialogue and stylistic\nexcellence make each and every one of\nhis movies a joy to watch. Inglourious\nBasterds is living proof that, now approaching fifty, Tarantino is still at the\ntop of his game.\nInglourious Basterds is showing at\nthe iCU Cinema at 6.30pm on Tuesday 30th November.\nExpressing his great vision or going in for a grope? Tarantino has always been controversial...\n\u201cEven with all the\nfeverish publicity,\nTarantino, and his\nfilms, remain an\nenigma\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 13\nSCIENCE\nFriday 26 November 2010\nacts on a pre-existing pool of substrate,\nyielding an output signal several orders\nof magnitude faster.\nCatechol (2,3)-dioxygenase (C23O)\nis the protein product of the XylE gene.\nIt originates from Pseudomonas pu-tida and is active as a homotetramer of\nC23O monomers. The enzyme naturally\ncatalyses the conversion of a colourless\nsubstrate (catechol) into a bright yellow\nproduct (2-hydroxymuconic semialde-hyde) within seconds of substrate addi-tion.\nModifying the XylE gene by fusing\nit to the GFP gene, they obtained GFPs\nfused to the N-terminus of C23O mono-mers. By allosteric inhibition, GFP prevents the C23O monomers from tetra-merising; they hence remain inactive in\nthe cytoplasm.\nThe fusion gene construct reveals the\nJames Goldsack\nSpace-time\ncloaking\npossibility\n\u201cLight normally slows\ndown as it enters\na material, but it is\npossible to manipu-late...so that some\nparts speed up\u201d\nScientists at Imperial College have developed a metamaterial that allows the\nmanipulation of the speed of light as it\npasses over an object, \u2018cloaking\u2019 the object\u2019s movement, according to a paper in\nthe Journal of Optics.\nPreviously, a team led by Professor\nSir John Pendry showed how an optical invisibility cloak was viable. Now,\na team led by Professor Martin McCall\nhas mathematically extended this idea to\none that conceals events.\n\u201cLight normally slows down as it\nenters a material, but it is theoretically\npossible to manipulate the light rays so\nthat some parts speed up and others slow\ndown,\u201d says Prof. McCall, from the Department of Physics.\nThe leading half of the light speeds up\nand arrives before an event, whilst the\ntrailing half is made to lag behind and\narrives too late. The result is that for a\nbrief period the event is not illuminated\nand escapes detection.\nSuch a space-time cloak would open\nup a temporary corridor through which\nenergy, information, and matter could be\nmanipulated or transported undetected.\nWhile this technology in practice is\nstill science fiction, there are many serious applications for the new research.\nCo-author Dr Paul Kinsler developed a\nproof of concept design using customised optical fibres, which would enable\nresearchers to use the event cloak in signal processing and computing.\nOne of the greatest difficulties faced\nby the team was how to speed up the\ntransmitted data without violating the\nlaws of relativity. The researchers devised a clever material whose properties\nvaried in both space and time, allowing\nthe cloak to be formed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sure that there are many other\npossibilities opened up by our introduction of the concept of the spacetime\ncloak,\u2019 says Prof. McCall, \u201cbut as it\u2019s\nstill theoretical at this stage we still need\nto work out the concrete details for our\nproposed applications.\u201d\nsecret of the output module\u2019s inducibil-ity: the GFP gene is fused to the XylE\ngene through a protein sequence recognised and cleaved by TEV protease.\nThus, when TEV is present in the cell,\nthe GFP is cleaved off from its C23O\nmonomer and the free monomers can\ntetramerise.\nTEV protease is a natural viral prote-ase. In the system, ComE transcription\nfactors bind to their native ComCDE\npromoter upstream from the TEV protease gene. Since ComE is activated only\nwhen CSP1 is cleaved, TEV protease is\nonly transcribed and translated upon detection of the Schistosoma parasite.\nThe TEV gene has high cleavage site\nspecificity and a relatively low molecular weight (242 amino-acids) resulting in\na relatively quick synthesis of the gene-product. TEV protease would then act\nupon a pre-existing pool of the inactive\nGFP-C23O substrate in the cell. Being\nrelatively fast, it has a high turnover rate\nof substrate molecules. This is the first\namplification step, making the response\nexponential over time instead of linear.\nThe activated C23O is itself an enzyme\nwith a high turnover rate, meaning that\ncolourless catechol molecules would be\nconverted to yellow coloured products\nvery fast. This second amplification step\nmakes the response hyper-exponential.\nThe IC team also ran a series of school\nworkshops based on NTDs. \u201cBridging\nthe gap between academics and capturing the wider public\u2019s attention can\nachieve so much\u201d, says the team. The\niGEMers even developed a software\ntoolkit that can be run autonomously\nand customised to the desired input. By\nchanging the protease recognition site\nNew anti-psychotic\ndrugs in pipeline\nSchizophrenia could be caused by abnormal levels of neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate, according to new\nresearch carried out at Imperial College\nLondon.\nResearchers found evidence that glu-tamate-releasing cells in the hippocampus influence the activity of dopamine-releasing cells, which in turn are linked\nwith causing psychosis.\nThe Medical Research Council funded\nthe research and the team scanned the\nbrains of 16 people at-risk for psychosis\nand 12 healthy volunteers, to measure\nlevels of dopamine and glutamate.\nA correlation was found between the\nglutamate levels in the hippocampus and\nthe dopamine levels in the brain.\nThis is strong evidence that there\ncould be a link between glutamate and\npsychosis in many patients.\nCurrent medication used to treat\nschizophrenia blocks the effects of dopamine in the brain and can have serious side effects. Some side effects are\nbad enough to stop the patient taking the\nmedication.\nThis research suggests that drugs that\ninterfere with glutamate signals in the\nbrain may be able to prevent psychotic\nsymptoms in schizophrenia sufferers,\nhopefully with less negative side effects.\nJames Goldsack\nLight and death for\nhospital superbugs\nA new technology that uses light beams\nto kill bacteria could be used in hospitals\nto stop the spread of MRSA and other\nantibiotic resistant bugs, say scientists\nfrom the University of Strathclyde.\nThe technology, known as HINS light,\nuses visible light wavelengths to excite\nmolecules within bacteria, producing\nhighly reactive chemicals which are\nlethal to bacteria yet mild enough to\nbe completely harmless to patients and\nstaff.\nProfessor Scott MacGregor, Dean of\nthe Faculty of Engineering, said \u201cHINSlight is a safe treatment that can be easily automated to provide continuous\ndisinfection of wards and other areas of\nthe clinical environment. The pervasive\nnature of light permits the treatment of\nair and all visible surfaces, regardless of\naccessibility.\u201d\nThe team are hopeful the new technology could become the foundation for a\nhospital-wide decontamination system,\nby using the HINS light alongside traditional hospital lighting.\nClinical trials at Glasgow Royal Infirmary have shown that the HINS light\nprovided significantly greater reductions of bacterial pathogens in the hospital environment than could be achieved\nby cleaning and disinfection alone.\nCharlie Harvey\nWashing your hands is also rumoured to work...\nBrain scans enabled researchers to look at the mechanisms involved\non the linker of the surface protein, any\nprotease could be detected.\nThe team now hopes their system\nwill come to good practical use. The\nbiochemical reaction in itself is \u201cin the\nbox\u201d; the skills and protocol are there for\nhaving it rapidly synthesised and ready\nto go. Now it needs to be incorporated\ninto a clever device for use on the ter-rain. The team have envisioned a test-tube like reservoir with the transgenic\nB. subtilis colony at the bottom and a\nlid with a stick attached. The user would\nunscrew the lid and dip the stick into the\nwater to be tested. The stick contains a\nfoamy coat containing skin lipids which\nattracts cercariae in the water if present.\nThey will release elastases, thus causing\na reaction!

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX\nFriday 26 NOVEMBER 2010\n16\nBusiness Editors: Sina Ataherian\nAfonso Campos\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRifts reappear less than a\nfortnight after G-20 pact\nNews Summary\nGovernment to measure happiness\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) is to start\nmeasuring quality of life in the UK from next April.\nThe decision to follow in the footsteps of such\neconomic powerhouses as Bhutan was announced\non Tuesday by David Cameron, who gave no indication of how \u2018well-being\u2019 would be measured but\nstated that current indicators would be insufficient.\nThe ONS currently measures indicators such\nas economic growth, unemployment, crime and\nmortality.\nDavid Cameron insisted that the next well-being\nindex would not distract from these other functions,\nmaintaining, \u201cI am clear that our most urgent priority is to get the economy moving, create jobs and\nspread opportunity to everyone.\u201d\nHe justified the policy by claiming that \u201cjust as we\ncan create the climate for business to thrive - by\ncutting taxes, slashing red tape and so on - so we\ncan create a climate in this country that is more\nfamily-friendly and more conducive to the good life.\u201d\nThere are suggestions that the main purpose of\nthe new statistics would be to divert attention from\na still stagnant economy.\nFrance has already started work on a similar pol-icy, headed by former World Bank chief economist\nJoseph Stiglitz who is to come up with new ways of\nmeasuring economic growth to account for broader\nchanges in \u2018social progress.\u2019\nBritish banks in discussions to\ncut bonuses\nFour of Britain\u2019s biggest banks are discussing a plan\nto pay out smaller bonuses this year and to increase\nlending to small businesses.\nAccording to insiders familiar with the negotia-tions, the Financial Services Authority is involved in\nthe talks and a joint statement is expected before\nChristmas.\nThe banks that are involved are Barclays, HSBC,\nRoyal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered.\nThe deal is seen as coming amid pressure from the\nGovernment, which now owns large stakes in British\nbanks, including controlling shares in the Royal Bank\nof Scotland.\nIt is also being seen as a potential forerunner to\nincreased intervention in the sector, with the new\nCoalition already committed to enforcing the previous Labour Government\u2019s policy of forcing banks to\nreveal the names of any executives making over \u00a31\nmillion in bonuses.\nAfter meeting in Seoul two weeks ago, governments from the G-20 group of the world\u2019s 19\nlargest economies plus the EU agreed to halt\ncompetitive currency devaluation in hopes of\nallaying fears of an all-out currency war. The\nG-20 finance ministers vowed to address tensions in the currency markets.\nThe Seoul Summit was only the latest in a series of such meetings and aimed to provide a\nforum for heads of government from the member countries, central bankers, finance ministers\nand institutions such as International Monetary\nFund (IMF) to discuss key issues like fighting\npoverty and building global financial safety\nnets. In addition to the G8 members, G20 also\nboasts an expanded membership list that includes emerging economies such as China and\nRussia.Against the backdrop of growing unease\nover the potential impact of a currency war, the\nleaders of the twenty member countries agreed\nto a broad goal of containing the rise of large\ncurrent account deficits or surpluses.\nThe agreement seemed then to be a temporary truce and now, less than two weeks since\nthe warm hand-shakes and smiles, several\ngovernments have resumed \u2018talking down\u2019 the\nprice of their currencies, with a potential view\ntowards further monetary easing. The \u201cSeoul\nAction Plan\u201d was reminiscent of many previ-ous, toothless, international monetary agreements with its promise to \u201cpursue the full range\nof policies conducive to reducing excessive\nimbalances.\u201d The pledge made during the Pittsburgh G-20 summit last year had a similar ring\nto it, and countries have yet to uphold it with\nconcrete policies. Now in the aftermath of the\nfinancial crisis, politicians are even less likely\nto muster the political will to implement policies to address trade imbalances for the fear of\nangering domestic exporters.\nFurthermore, unlike supranational organizations like the World Bank, the G-20 has no real\npower to back its promises. While countries\ncan agree on a vague sense of direction such\nas \u201ccorrecting the trade imbalances\u201d, they cannot lay out specific policies to be implemented\nin order to achieve a measurable outcome. The\nUS, for example, has proposed \u201cindicative\nguidelines\u201d for current account balances. This\nmove immediately came under attack from\nministers in countries such as Germany and\nChina, which have large surpluses.\nThe costs of inaction are high: if countries\nacross the board cheapen their currency at the\nsame rate, no one will gain an advantage over\nothers but everyone will face inflationary pressures that will threaten their economy. Devaluation will also have a net negative impact on the\neconomy as importers suffer from higher prices\nof goods denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe countries are now trapped in a classic \u2018Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma\u2019: while every country will gain\nif the promises are kept, the high payoff gained\nfrom unilateral devaluation will eventually\ncause a race to become the first country to resume lowering its currency value. This prompts\nother countries to react with similar measures,\nand everyone will be worse off as a result.\nMoreover, emerging countries that stood by\nthe market mechanisms rather than resorting to\ncurrency control will be hard pressed to stem\nthe upward spiral of their currency. As the value of US Dollars weakened due to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s quantitative easing measures, capital flowed elsewhere as investors looked for\nhigher yields. The destinations of such capital\noutflow are mainly the emerging economies,\ndestabilising their economy by causing currencies to appreciate.\nUnless the Federal Reserve eases the downward pressure on it currency, the pressure on\nother nations for debasement is unlikely to\nabate. Even though the US government claimed\nthat it would never seek to weaken the US Dollars as a tool to gain competitive advantage, the\neffects of its monetary policy will be keenly felt\nelsewhere, especially since the Federal Reserve\nembarked on another round of money printing\na few weeks ago.\nOn the other hand, the G-20 is not completely impotent when it comes to stopping the\ncurrency war. The meeting promotes a global\nnetwork of key policy makers and their staff,\nwhich can contribute greatly to the coordination of macroeconomic policies, especially at\ntimes of great uncertainty. There is a growing consensus amongst the G-20 leaders that\ninternational economic cooperation is necessary given the growing interdependence of the\ncountries. France, the next chair of the group, is\noptimistic that it will have growing clout as the\nmain platform for international governmental\nco-ordination.\nIt remains to be seen how effective the G20\nsummit will be at tackling the issue of trade\nimbalances. By actively involving the emerging economies in multilateral dialogue, it may\nhave the highest chance of establishing a global\nframework for monetary policies since Bretton\nWoods in 1944. However, international agreements of this kind on their own rarely mean\nmuch. Only when the G-20 makes real progress\non cooling the current currency conflicts will it\nearn any credibility as a body capable of solving global economic problems.\nBusinesses and investors given new causes for concern\nOuch, brown shoes... bad move bro. Well o.k. I\u2019ll concede that the handkerchief in the breast pocket saves the ensemble slightly\nLingxi Huang\nI\u2019d measure her as \u2018somewhat\u2019 happy...\n\n"

    "content": "21\nfelix FRIDAY 26 novemBER 2010\nCOMMENT\nT\nhis week I played some vid-eogames. You might think\nthat this isn\u2019t particularly\nannouncement\u2013worthy in\nan age of Farmville and Bejewelled. On the face of it, videogames\nare part of our culture now. But read a\ngaming fansite or web forum and you\u2019d\nbe forgiven for thinking we were in the\nmiddle of a cultural apartheid.\nDoes anyone actually care about videogames any more? I\u2019m talking about the\ngiggling disdain that used to be poured\non people who play them. I\u2019m not sure\nthis actually exists any more, and weird-ly, the gaming hardcore seem to be pining for its return. Mike Channell wrote\non the Official XBox Magazine Blog\nthat \u201cGames won\u2019t get you the girlyet\u201d last week. The piece is a genuinely\nunbelievable anecdote about meeting a\n\u2018reasonably cute\u2019 girl (so kind, Mike) at\na game launch party.\nBearing in mind that Miss Above Average Looks was attending a party designed to celebrate a videogame, Mike\nclaims she was surprised and disgusted\nto learn what Mike did for a living. If\nshe really was surprised, then that\u2019s\nAngry Geek\nsome remarkable ignorance on her part.\nMaybe she thought the party was celebrating some new, very interactive film\nor something. Mike goes on to explain\nhow horrible she was, and then remark\nthat her kind is \u2018dying out\u2019, in a rather\nominous sentence. Then it\u2019s time for the\nrallying call. Over to Mike for this bit:\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, though, and you\nand I are just leading the charge. No\nmatter how cool it is that more people\nare gaming...there are still going to be\npeople who think we\u2019re worthless human belly button fluff. But you know\nwhat? They\u2019re wrong and we\u2019re right.\nRemember that.\u201d\nPlease bear in mind that Mike reviews\nvideogames in exchange for a monthly\nsalary. He isn\u2019t leading a guerilla resistance movement or fighting against\nsocial oppression. Instead of playing\ngames in the evening, someone is willing to pay him to do it during the day,\non the condition he writes about them a\nbit. That\u2019s it. He closes with this killer\nshot: \u201cFarewell angry lady, I hope one\nday you\u2019re having as much fun as I am.\u201d\nZING. Don\u2019t hold out, Mike! Go for\nthe jugular!\nHere\u2019s the thing; videogames are cool\nnow. Almost everyone plays them, and\nvery few people genuinely would be\ndisgusted to meet someone who wrote\nabout them for a living. Of course, that\ngave gamers an identity: The Underdog.\nNow that\u2019s gone, it seems some of them\n- particularly journalists, for whom this\nrole generated a lot of material - are realising that role hasn\u2019t been replaced with\nsomething exciting or sexy. They\u2019re\nnow just \u2018dude who plays videogames\u2019.\nSo this week, readers, I played vide-ogames. That\u2019s it. Maybe you read a\nbook. I respect your choice of entertainment and don\u2019t wish to bring any judgement against you. However, if you see\nany Mike Channells out there this week,\nbe sure to round them up and execute\nthem on sight. The only thing making\ngaming unpopular these days are the\nove rcompensating twunts who thought\nit would always be that way.\nAre you, or is someone you know,\nMike Channell? Do you know someone affected by Mike Channell?\nFeel free not to get in touch at anan-grygeek@googlemail.com\nB\narack Obama has something in common with the\nEngland Football team.\nFor good or bad, he made\npolitics interesting again\nduring the 2008 Presidential campaign.\nYet since he has been in power, his approval ratings have started to drop as\npeople realise with just how unreachable\ntheir levels of expectation were.\nMeanwhile, at every World Cup or\nEuropean Championship, and each\ntime England hires a new manager the\nentire country cries \u201cFootball\u2019s coming\nhome!\u201d the inevitable ensues, as England fall embarrassingly far of their am-bitions. The fans are as deluded as the\nApprentice candidates.\nThe final straw came last Wednesday\nwhen France beat a dismal three lions\n2-1 on English turf, at Wembley.\nThis summer, France had the worst\nWorld Cup of all football powerhouses\n\u2013 after only qualifying thanks to the\nhand of Thierry Henry. They mustered\nonly one point in the group stages, losing to lightweights Mexico and South\nAfrica. The players went on strike (it is\ntheir national sport) boycotting a training session, and their best striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home like a naughty\nschool boy.\nThat England only had a marginally\nCharles Betts\nbetter World Cup is not the issue. It is\ntheir respective responses to a tournament as poor as the latest Justin Bieber\nsingle that are markedly different.\nThe French players apologised to the\nfans. Manager Raymond Domenech\nwas swiftly ushered out, and in his place\ncame Laurent Blanc. In his first game in\ncharge, Blanc suspended every player\nfrom the World Cup squad as a collective punishment. Wednesday\u2019s victory\nwas another step towards the team\u2019s\ngradual renewal.\nEngland responded to a dismal sojourn in South Africa by keeping Fabio\nCapello in charge. Not because they had\nconfidence in his abilities, but because\nhe was too expensive to dismiss. On a\n\u00a36 million/year salary, the Italian would\ncost the FA \u00a310 million to sack. By\ncomparison, the French Football Federation pays Blanc around \u00a3900,000/year.\nFor the record, Barack Obama earns\ncirca \u00a3250,000/year \u2013 who do you think\nrepresents the best value for money?\nIt is incredulous that the FA are foolish\nenough to think they can win a trophy\nby throwing money at an Italian who can\nbarely speak English, has a strained relationship with the players, and has done\nlittle to rejuvenate a stale team since taking over from Steve McLaren. Capello\u2019s\nclub record aside, he has no international pedigree and has failed to instill any\nfreshness into the squad.\nManagers aside, football teams cannot win big trophies without the best\ngoalkeepers. Or to paraphrase Jose\nMourinho, you cannot make the best\nomelettes without the best eggs. Spain,\nthe current World Champions, boast\ntwo of the world\u2019s finest keepers \u2013 one\nwho plays for Real Madrid, the other for\nBarcelona. England have a dearth of decent goalies, and the first-choice keepers\nfor the top three Premier League teams\nare not English. The same applies with\nstrikers. England can only boast Wayne\nRooney, who failed to score at the World\nCup. Crouch, Defoe, and C. Cole are\nnot world class \u2013 they lack, forgive the\nexpression, the X factor. They are perennial underachievers, the footballing\nequivalent of Tim Henman.\nThe team will remain unchanged right\nup until the end of Euro 2012. Whether\nthis continuity will bring them closer\ntogether and improve performances, or\njust prolong the inevitable string of substandard results remains to be seen. One\nthing is for certain \u2013 in the short term,\nthe fans will continue to boo, much to\nWayne Rooney\u2019s pathetic chagrin.\nSo much for the \u201cThe Audacity of\nHope\u201d, it is all rather more \u201cThe Delusion of Hope.\u201d\nThree lambs on the shirt\n\u201cEngland fans\nare as deluded\nas the Apprentice\ncandidates\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing;\nvideogames are cool\nnow.\u201d\nDon\u2019t be a James\nBlunt...\nGeekiness goes beyond gaming Anyone can claim to have saved\nthe world. I stopped the toast\nfrom going that little bit too\nbrown this morning. I don\u2019t\nknow it yet, but this could have\nsaved the world.\nJames Blunt has claimed that\nhe stopped World War III from\nhappening. Single handedly, on\nhis own, and with no other input.\nSomehow I doubt that the British high command would have\ndelegated the whole decision\nof attacking Russian troops in\nthe Balkans to a warbling and\narrogant crooner. If they did,\nthen this makes me feel for the\nquality of our beloved armed\nforces. If every captain in the\narmy was going to get a little bit\ntoo cocksure on patrol and release something into the world\ncomparable to fingernails being\ndragged down a blackboard,\nthen I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t\nmore deserters. \u2018Beautiful\u2019 being played at full pitch as I try\nto keep the peace is more likely\nto make me scream in anguish\nand turn the gun on myself\nrather than shoot any Russian\ntroops. So maybe he has a very\ntentative point. As tentative a\npoint as a hooker has a choice\nabout positions. An input, but\nno real claim.\nImagine that Aqua come out\nand claim they made David\nCameron the annoying prat, but\nnonetheless prime minister,\nthat he is today. It\u2019s not that absurd a claim compared to World\nWar III kicking off to the sound\nof Back to Bedlam. Maybe the\ntwee and trashy 90s Europop\ncaused David to be the man he\nis today. Somehow I doubt it.\nIt reminds me of ridiculous\nclaims in the acceptance\nspeeches of arseholes that\nmasquerade as actors. There\u2019s\nnever enough use and execution of the word understated. If\nthe world of celebrity was a little bit more David Mitchell than\nBez from the Happy Mondays,\nthe world would be free of people like me face\u2013palming at every corner. Not only is the image\nof repetitive face\u2013palming comi-cal, it\u2019s also resolutely annoying\nto the person concerned.\nSo James, if we are to believe\na man who once sung to a puppet because he lost his triangle\nand missed its hypotenuse, obviously a code name for \u2018a hell\nof a lot of dope\u2019, and that you\ndid in fact save the world, then\nthank you. Thank you so much\nJames. Rob Cleaver\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\n\n"

    "content": "Pyongyang \u2013 crumbling from within?\nThe North Korean State has been constructed\non the ideology of Juche - total self reliance:\n\u201cman is the master of everything and decides\neverything.\u201d Some people describe this as a religion without God.\nIn the heart of Pyongyang, on the banks of\nthe city\u2019s Taedong River, opposite Kim Il Sung\nSquare, stands the Juche Tower. Completed in\n1982, to celebrate Kim Il Sung\u2019s 70th birth-day, at 170 metres the Tower stands marginally taller than the Washington Monument, on\nwhich it appears to be modelled. To my eye,\nit appears more like the Tower of Babel \u2013 the\nconstruction of which is described in the Book\nof Genesis and revolves around man\u2019s determination to compete with God. Whilst making my\nthird visit to North Korea, I was taken to see the\nJuche Tower.\nPerhaps symbolising both the current condition of North Korea\u2019s economy, and its desperate need for more than self reliance, my embarrassed guide explained that we could not\nascend, as debris was falling from within, onto\nthe elevator. The situation, he explained, was\nvery dangerous \u2013 it seemed an appropriately\ngraphic metaphor.\nNo nation wants to be in thrall to others, especially one that experienced half a century\nof Japanese occupation, but isolation has not\nserved North Korea well.\nBeyond North Korea\u2019s sloganeering rhetoric\nand the proud braggadocio is a nation which\nsenses change in the air.\nThe Soviet model is discredited; its powerful\nneighbour, China, is in the throes of a liberal-ising revolution; and North Korea knows that\nself reliance will not be enough.\nSenior officials, including the Speaker of\ntheir Assembly, Choe Tae Bok, insisted to me\nthat over the next two years the new priorities\nare \u201cprosperity and dignity\u201d with a \u201cunified,\ndenuclearised Korea\u201d as their first objective.\nThe West should listen carefully and respond\nappropriately. The alternative does not bear\nthinking about.\nPOLITICS\nFELIX\n18\nPolitics Editors: Hassan Joudi, Rory Fenton\nJames Lees, Rajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNorth Korea attacks \u2013 an act\nof desperation?\nN\north Korea\u2019s unprovoked attack this Tuesday on a South\nKorean island, just 120km\nfrom Seoul, threatened to\nbreak the fragile peace with its\nsouthern neighbour. Resulting in the death of\ntwo soldiers and two civilians, the artillery assault was denounced by the UN as \u2018one of the\nworst violations\u2019 of the armistice which ended\nthe Korean War in 1953. But far from showing strength, many analysts are suggesting\nthat the attacks signal the final thrashes of a\ndying beast. Rumours abound that North Korea\u2019s aging ruler, Kim Jong Il, is in poor health\nand many have questioned his choice of his\nyoungest son, Kim Jong Un, who is perceived\nas a weak choice to head the world\u2019s fourth\nlargest standing army.\nWriting for Felix before Tuesday\u2019s attacks,\nLord David Alton (chair of the All Party Committee on North Korea) sheds some revealing\nlight on the state of the isolated country, following his recent visit there, and suggests a\npath to peace.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nCanada\nSouth Korea says it will retaliate with missile strikes\nagainst the North if faced with \u201cfurther provocations\u201d, after an exchange of fire in which two South\nKorean marines and civilians were killed. 15 South\nKorean soldiers and 3 civilians were also hurt in the incident when the North bombarded Yeonpyeong Island with\nartillery. The island lies near the disputed Northern Limit\nLine which serves as a de facto border between the two\nKoreas. South Korean President Lee called the incident\nan attack on South Korean territory and deployed military jets to Yeonpyeong Island. The North meanwhile\ndisputes the incident claiming that it was in self defence\nafter South Korea fired shells into its territory. North Korea is facing a looming succession to ailing leader Kim\nJong Il and the recent aggression could be an attempt by\nhis heir Kim Jong Un to burnish his credentials amongst\nthe military hardliners.\nSouth Korea\nBritish Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court has begun hearings on whether Canada\u2019s anti-polygamy law violates\nthe freedom of religion guaranteed by the Constitution.\nThe case will focus on a breakaway Mormon sect which\nhas practised multiple marriages since the 1940s. Canada\nhas so far declined to prosecute polygamists, fearing that\nthe 19th century anti-polygamy law could be declared un-constitutional. 36 witnesses, including women in polygamous marriages, are expected to testify in court. British\nColumbian officials want to pursue polygamy cases, saying that it causes serious social harm and has no place in\nCanadian society. Supporters of polygamy, however, contend that it is their right to form the type of families they\nwant as guaranteed by the Constitution.\nGambia\nGambia has severed all diplomatic and economic ties\nwith Iran and expelled all Iranian diplomats and\nstate representatives.\nGambian officials did not offer any explanation for the\nmove, which Iran claims was taken under US pressure.\nThe recent interception of Iranian arms bound for Gambia in violation of UN Security Council resolutions may\nhave played a role in Gambia\u2019s decision. The decision to\nsever all ties with Iran could be costly for the West African nation as several\nIranian funded proj-ects, including a \u00a31.3\nbillion agreement to\nsupply Gambia with\nheavy and commercial vehicles, will now\ncome to an end.\nFriday 26 November 2010\nStanding tall but\ncrumbling inside:\nLord David Alton\nof Liverpool\n\u2013 Switzerland and the UK, perhaps \u2013 and held\nin Beijing, could enable the North and South to\nformally end the War, and to conclude a Peace\nTreaty. This would transform the situation; and\nbreathe new life into the six party talks on de-nuclearisation.\nThroughout the Cold War, the West countered Soviet aggression with formidable de-fences.\nSimultaneously, through the Helsinki Process, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan,\nelevated discourse on human rights and fundamental freedoms. Through engagement, they\nencouraged economic and political reform.\nToday on the Korean peninsula we need \u201cHelsinki, with a Korean face.\u201d\nWriting in \u201cPeace While Advancing Rights:\nThe Untried Approach to North Korea\u201d the\nAmerican analyst, David Hawk, also advocates\nthis approach.\nWithout over exaggerating the outcomes, or\nslipping into a self congratulatory naivety, over\nthe past seven years I have doggedly raised\nquestions of political and religious freedom\nand human rights with the North Koreans.\nAnd I have witnessed some modest developments \u2013 the building of a Russian Orthodox\nchurch, the opening of a Protestant seminary,\nand significant English language teaching programmes in the universities and schools. But, in\na year when there have been further reports of\nthe execution of Christians in North Korea, we\nshould not become complacent - and continue\nto work for the sort of change that brought the\npeaceful collapse of the the Berlin Wall.\nGiven that the United Nations say that\n300,000 people still languish in North Korean\ncamps, many because of religious convictions,\nI am particularly struck by the positive impact\nof faith-based initiatives and the determination\nof Christians to remain engaged.\nThe brand new Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) established by\nthe charismatic Dr.James Chin Kyung Kim, is\na fine example.\nAnd he is not alone: an American Catholic\npriest, Fr. Gerry Hammond, has now legally\nentered North Korea on 43 occasions, taking\nlife saving medicines and equipment to combat\ntuberculosis; other projects aim to increase rice\nyields and harvests.\nMen like Fr. Gerry and James Kim represent\nthe way in which Korea can move on. As the\ndebris falling from within the Juche Tower un-derlines, to ignore a crumbling structure is to\ncreate an even more dangerous situation.\n2010 is the sixtieth anniversary of the Korean War \u2013 which claimed the lives of an estimated 3 million Korean people. Almost 38,000\nAmerican and British soldiers died, along with\n183,000 Chinese.\nThe DMZ, at the 38th parallel which divides the country, bristles with weapons and,\nin a country where malnutrition is wide-spread,\nNorth Korea diverts its meagre resources into\nsustaining the world\u2019s fourth largest standing\narmy of one million men. The situation is made\neven more dangerous by the addition of a nuclear capability.\nSince the 1953 Armistice there have been intermittent spats and skirmishes \u2013 some, like the\nsinking of the South Korean vessel, Cheonan,\nin March this year, with loss of life; others, like\nthe recent shots fired across the border represent bellicose sabre rattling.\nFor nearly sixty years there has been neither\nwar nor peace \u2013 merely a shaky stop-gap ar-mistice. The US has no diplomatic presence -although Britain opened an embassy a decade\nago.\nI was in the country in my capacity as Chairman of the British All-Party Parliamentary\nCommittee on North Korea \u2013 founded following my first visit in 2003. Three years earlier\nBritain had created diplomatic relations and we\nhave had an embassy in the country ever since.\nOur Ambassadors and parliamentarians have\nbeen pursuing a painstaking and patient strategy of constructive critical engagement.\nThis needs to be taken to its logical conclu-sion: a new Peace Conference, jointly convened by a neutral nation and by a combatant\n\n"

Not just because they\u2019ve threatened my freedom of\nspeech, but because they can\u2019t even say\nthe word \u2018cunt\u2019. Now I\u2019m not saying\nthat the vulgarity should just be thrown\naround willy cunting nilly, but it should\nat least be recognised and valued for its\nunrivalled power to shock. Some of\nyou may have already turned the page\nby now with a grimace of protest, but in\nmy eyes you\u2019re not principled or high-minded, you\u2019re simply weak. If you so\nvehemently object to an offensive word\nbecause it offends, then you might as\nwell object to your own lungs when\nthey manage to successfully supply your\nblood with oxygen! The word is just doing its job.\nObscenities, profanities and vulgarities have been used in written language\nfor centuries. Shakespeare was a notorious potty mouth and much of his\nwork was censored for the sake of them\nyoungsters. Even Chaucer supposedly\nused an early form of the word \u2018cunt\u2019\nin \u2018The Miller\u2019s Tale\u2019. The question is\nwhy such historic writers felt the need to\nuse foul language. The simple answer is\nto push buttons. Shakespeare wanted to\nenrage and incense his audience\nand Chaucer was just a filthy\npervert who also happened\nto be a very tal- ented poet.\nI\u2019m not equating myself to these\nliterary masters, but I also like to push\nbuttons. I will never use a \u2018nasty word\u2019\nunless I deem it absolutely necessary.\nThe word \u2018cunt\u2019 has nearly exactly the\nsame meaning as \u2018twat\u2019, \u2018fanny\u2019 and\n\u2018vulva\u2019, but calling someone a vulva\ndoesn\u2019t seem to pack the same punch.\nNo, despite the words meaning the same\nthing, the word \u2018cunt\u2019 sounds offensive\njust because, well, it sounds offensive.\nThe psychology behind our emotional\nresponses to vulgarities is surprisingly\ncomplicated and there are countless papers written on the subject. I don\u2019t have\nthe page space to go into detail, but just\ntake a moment to ask yourself why you\nfind the word \u2018cunt\u2019 so utterly deplor-able. If someone called you a vulva,\nwould you have the same response?\nSwearing is a vital linguistic element in both spoken and written word,\nbut more importantly humour. If you\nhaven\u2019t worked it out by now, I have\nvery strong opinions on the subject matter and this is the first time I\u2019ve really\nbeen that serious about something in\nFelix. If I want to use the word \u2018cunt\u2019,\nit\u2019s because I want to offend said \u2018cunt\u2019.\nIf I wanted to call said \u2018cunt\u2019 a \u2018twat\u2019, a\n\u2018douche\u2019, or an \u2018asshole\u2019, I would have\nused \u2018twat\u2019, \u2018douche\u2019 or \u2018asshole\u2019. If\nreaders want to complain about the use\nof the word \u2018cunt\u2019 then let them com-plain. Or just star out the \u2018u\u2019. And the\n\u2018n\u2019 as well if you want. Starring out letters is like giving Imperial students a\npuzzle and they love puzzles! In fact it\u2019s\nlike playing hangman.\nIf Shakespeare was allowed to swear, then why not\nHangman? Actually, don\u2019t answer that...\nOi, oi! I\u2019m\ntalking to you,\nthere\u2019s nothing\nto see here. This\nis some bullshit\nsan serif text\nin bold. You\neasily distracted\nwanker!!!\nChildish? Nah-uhhh. What do you mean \u201chow did I get into Imperial?\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\n40 felix\nFRIDAY 26 NOVEMBER 2010\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSports Editor: Jovan Nedic\nDavid Wilson\nHandball\nForgotten Sports\nThis week, Felix Sport takes a look\nat one of Imperial\u2019s sporting new-borns. Carina Carter is no stranger\nto using her hands\nTeam Handball is a very popular sport in continental\nEurope and has been an Olympic sport for years.\nThe modern handball sport started in the latter half\nof the nineteenth century, although the origin of\nthe game can be traced back to the ancient period,\nwhen Greeks played a similar game.\nIn Handball, two teams of 7 players each (6 field\nplayers and a goalkeeper) pass and dribble a ball to\nultimately throw it into the goal of the other team.\nIt is a fast game with almost a goal scored every\nminute of a game.\nCrisp, fluent and creative ball movement is paramount in setting up scoring opportunities in Handball, since no players are allowed inside the six-me-ter arc outlining the goal area. The offensive team\nworks the ball quickly around the perimeter and tries\nto set up a shot, which can reach a speed of over\n100km/h. That makes the Handball the 2nd fastest\nindoor sport and arguably the most exciting one to\nwatch and play.\nThis might all sound a bit hectic and confusing,\nbut it is easy to pick up and helps to develop many\nof the basic athletics skills needed in other sports.\nImperial Handball\nWhat is Handball?\nCan\u2019t kick, won\u2019t kick?\nSign up for Handball\nFormed in 2007, handball or the\u2019 Imperial\nEagles\u2019 as they like to be known, is one of the\nlatest sporting additions at Imperial. Despite\nbeing hugely popular with our neighbours on\nthe continent, handball is still relatively new\nin the UK so you can be excused if you\u2019ve\nhaven\u2019t got a clue what the sport is about.\nThe sport\u2019s popularity in the UK is growing\nthough, with more universities forming teams.\nTeam GB are also entering a handball team in\n2012 for the very first time.\nHandball must be one of the few sports\nplayed at Imperial not to be part of BUCS,\nshowing how new the sport really is, and\nso their fixtures are organised by the British\nHandball Association. As well as friendlies\nthey play four league fixtures a term, where\nthey compete against other universities and\nalso non-university teams. The club has a\nmen\u2019s team (obviously, it is Imperial...) but\nalso have a joint ladies\u2019 team, last year with\nOxford and now with UCL, so that the girls\ncan compete too. Several members also play\nfor a local team (the \u2018Ruislip Eagles\u2019), allowing them to play more.\n\u201cThere were six Imperial players that went\non to win the EHA (England Handball Association) cup, which qualified us to play on a European level\u201d says the clubs secretary Stefan\nBauer; \u201cAs you can see, we cater for beginners\nand give strong players the chance to play at a\nvery competitive level too\u201d.\nWhilst the club do not go on tour as such\nlike other sports teams, they are lucky to compete in various tournaments in the year and so\nhave several weekends away. They travel to\nFrance every year to take part in the \u2018Challenge Centrale Lyon\u201d\nThis involves around 8000 uni students descending on Lyon to compete in a variety of\nsports and is apparently a lot of fun. They\nalso compete in the UK University Championships and were awarded the \u2018fair play award\u2019\nlast year. The club is currently trying to set up\na South England tournament as a way for uni\nteams around London to get more games.\nHandball is still a fairly small club with\naround 30 members, which means that the\nsocial side is good because everyone knows\neach other.\nAlways intrigued to find out about clubs\ndrinking traditions, I was told the Imperial\nEagles tipple of choice is \u2018vodka cornichon\u2019,\nwhich is vodka with a pickle water mixer (I\nthink I\u2019ll stick to the more traditional mixers personally). The club had a good intake\nof freshers with many of them having never\nplayed before.\nIf you fancy giving it a try, the club trains at\nethos on a Wednesday night 8-10pm. Membership is \u00a325 for the year and taster sessions\nare free.\nCarina Carter\nThe Imperial Eagles in action\nRugby: back on track\nthe final ten minutes behind, the team eventually emerged 26-22 victors thanks to a late\ntry from Ed Labinski who is making a habit of\nscoring \u2018game winning tries\u2019.\nThe victory got Imperial\u2019s season back on\ntrack and provided a first win for stand in skipper Charlie Esberger.\nThere is only one game remaining this term\nagainst Saint Bart\u2019s and the team are determined to put in a big and impressive performance before Christmas which they hope they\ncan carry through into the new year culminating in a league title as well as the ever elusive\nVarsity victory.\n***\nThe Second XV put on a spirited display but\nwere knocked out of the BUCS cup by UCL 1st\nXV, losing 21-19. The team will no doubt feel\nhard done by after what appeared to be a legitimate try was not awarded in the dying minutes,\nfurthermore fly half Rob Dowden had the opportunity to win the game with a penalty kick\nin the last play of the game however, his kick\nwent agonisingly wide of the left post.\nThe team put on a spirited performance\nthroughout the match with the forwards providing a useful platform for the backs to work\noff. In the lital last few minutes of the match,\nwith Imperial knowing that they were chasing\nthe victory, the forwards continually provided\nthrust, battering UCL backwards. The outcome however, eluded Imperial but they can\ntake heart from the fact that they competed\nwell against and probably should have beaten\na team which inflicted a heavy defeat on them\nin the opening game of the season.\nThe team will take this experience and use it\nto their advantage as they look to end this term\non the back of a decent run of results, hoping\nthat they can turn around a run of narrow losses\nin the new year.\n***\nThe fourth team succumbed to a crushing\n60-3 against a supposed Imperial Medicals\nthird XV, a team which contained a number\nof players who seemed to resemble players\nwho played in the Varsity match earlier in the\nseason. The fourth team put on a spirited performance against a team who were clearly of a\nbetter standard.\nThe team will look forward to their next encounter with the medics and will be confident\nof achieving a result against their rivals before\ntheir eagerly anticipated Varsity matchup in\nMarch.\n....Cotinued from back page\n\n"

Felix set out to investigate just what draws students\nto rival establishments and whether\nother London universities have got\nthe upper hand, or if Imperial College Union has spent its money in\nall the right places.\nReporting by Matt Colvin and Alex\nKarapetian\nIllustrations by Veronika McQuadeova\nHOW DOES OUR\nUNION COMPARE?\nThere is \u201ca good selection of beers\u201d and the bar\n\u201cfunctions quite well and the drinks are cheap\nenough\u201d. Some criticisms were that the layout\n\u201cprevents more people sitting and having drinks\u201d.\nStudent opinions\nImperial \u2013 FiveSixEight The Kriss Akabusi\nPleasure Lounge \u2013 UCL\nSOAS - SOAS Bar\nThe price of beer in FiveSixEight is one of the\ncheapest compared to other Unions. For wine\nand shots the prices are of comparable price to\nothers. The design and quality of the bar was far\nbeyond any other university, but that\u2019s what you\nget when you spend \u00a32.5 million.\nStudent opinions\nTwo UCL 3rd years were less than impressed\nwith the \u201cabsurdly expensive ales\u201d. They said that\nFiveSixEight would have to be made of gold for it\nto be worth the long trip\u201d to South Kensington.\nThe UCL bar is much larger than Imperial\u2019s but\nthis ruins the atmosphere when less full. A less\nrobust entertainment program than FiveSixEight\npromises discounted drinks on certain nights,\nwith some selected drinks being as low as \u00a31\nalongside such deals as 4 pint pitchers for \u00a34.\nAn anthropolgy PhD student said that the bar was\n\u201cawesome and cheap\u201d, explaining that friendly bar\nstaff, dressed in casual wear rather than uniforms,\nhelped contribute towards a more relaxed bar.\nStudent opinions SOAS\u2019 bar is casual to the extreme, resembling\na backpacker hostel if anything. Two pool tables\nwere in full use by students and there was even a\nmicrowave for students to use. In terms of events,\nSOAS does not provide a great deal in the bar it-self, with a quiz night the main regular highlight.\nThe Duck and Dive \u2013 ULU\nStudent opinions\nWe gained an positive overall impression about\nthe bar from the students with one masters student telling us she came to the bar every day and\nthat she \u201cwouldn\u2019t change a thing\u201d.\nOne of ULU\u2019s student union bars, The Duck &\nDive has a professional look and numerous television screens showing sports. There were deals on\nfood, with 2 burgers available for \u00a36 on Tuesdays\nand Thursdays. There is a strong lineup of daily\nevents with a focus on reduced alcohol prices.\nLSE - The Three Tuns\nThere were few positive comments about Crush.\nOne student said, \u201cit\u2019s terrible.\u201d The students also\ncommented that they often visit King\u2019s College\nUnion due to its close proximity.\nStudent opinions This was the biggest disappointment. The entire\nroom was completely devoid of anyone by 10pm\nand last orders were called before 10:30pm. LSE\noften holds popular student nights in its bars\nsuch as Crush or Candybox, alongside comedy\nnights for just \u00a33 compared with UCL\u2019s \u00a38 entry.\nTutu\u2019s \u2013 King\u2019s College\nStudent opinions\nA group of SOAS Freshers said that it was \u201camazing\u201d and that they would \u201ccome back often\u201d. Upon\nhearing of Imperial College Union\u2019s new renova-tion, they expressed interest in visiting.\nSimilar in taste to Imperial\u2019s Eastside Bar, Tutu\u2019s\nhas a fantastic view of London\u2019s skyline across\nthe river. With a separate website for events, the\nUnion attracts popular comedians and perform-ers. Entry for club nights is often \u00a33 but for more\nprominent acts entry goes as high as \u00a316.\nI\nK\nS\nUC\nUL\nL\nK\nL\nS\nUL\nI\nUC\nK\nS\nUL I\nBEER\nSOAS \u2013 \u00a32.60\nKings \u2013 \u00a32.50\nULU \u2013 \u00a32.40\nLSE \u2013 \u00a32.10\nUCL \u2013\u00a32.00\nImperial \u2013 \u00a32.00\nWINE\nSOAS \u2013 \u00a32.20\nKings \u2013 \u00a32.50\nULU \u2013 \u00a31.80\nLSE \u2013 \u00a32.40\nUCL \u2013 \u00a31.50\nImperial \u2013 \u00a31.90\nSHOTS\nSOAS \u2013 \u00a32.20\nKings \u2013 \u00a32.50\nULU \u2013 \u00a31.80\nLSE \u2013 \u00a31.90\nImperial \u2013 1.80\n\n"

But let\u2019s work with it and make\nit work, it hasn\u2019t been easy, the first few rehearsals I had real difficulty.\nPranav: Directing\u2019s been a lot of fun. I think\nI was expecting the hard times, the organising,\nhaving to rehearse every day, but I\u2019ve got such\na great team with me and I think you need that,\nas a director.

But the most rewarding thing is when I\u2019ve written this page, and\nthe actors just sort of get it; they know what it\nmeans. We did a scene for the first time, and I\nalmost wasn\u2019t sure if we\u2019d rehearsed it already\nbecause that was exactly how it was in my\nhead, and it\u2019s the most amazing thing because\nthey\u2019ve literally brought the characters to life\nand I didn\u2019t even have to tell them.\nPranav: I actually think that\u2019s the most enjoyable part, when you sit there and someone has\ninterpreted what you\u2019ve written in a completely\ndifferent way, but better.\nShamini: That\u2019s always really good, you just\nthink \u201cOh my god! yes! Why didn\u2019t I think of\nthat?\u201d It\u2019s about other people bringing their\ncreativity, and it\u2019s all of you working towards it\ntogether, that\u2019s so nice.\nGilead: I found the most stressful thing was\nhaving a personal stake in the writing, I don\u2019t\nknow if it\u2019s the same for you but I\u2019m a hugely\nsensitive person to criticism. Not because I disregard it, but because I consider any criticism\nto be absolutely justified, and it sends me cowering into a corner thinking, \u201cWhy am I in this\nroom with such knowledgable people?!\u201d\nPranav: That for me is the most exciting thing,\nthat my name is written on this and any criticism is going to come back to me, but I\u2019m just\nlaying myself out there and saying, this is what\nI can do, what do you reckon?\nFor me the hardest thing was casting because\nI had to turn down so many great actors who I\ncouldn\u2019t cast. That\u2019s the hardest thing so far,\nI\u2019ve still got three days\u2026 I hope people will\ncome because it\u2019s important with all three\nproductions to remember that these are Imperial students acting, they\u2019ve got their studies\nand everything else going on but they\u2019ve also\nworked extremely hard to put on these shows;\nrehearsing day-in day-out and learning lines in\ntheir spare time. It\u2019s important for them to see\ntheir colleagues, their peers and their friends,\nanybody, coming and supporting them because\nit\u2019s pointless just performing to an empty room.\nGilead: Hear hear.\nWill you be continuing to write?\nPranav: Absolutely, I\u2019ve got all sorts of ideas\nbumping about that I\u2019d like to get down.\nGilead: Well, I\u2019m graduating this year, so I\u2019ve\nhad a lot of fun out of this, mainly because I\nmay not be able to do it again. Revues tend to be\nthe stuff of boarding schools, prisons and military outfits rather than just general workplace\nhumour. So I\u2019ve enjoyed this while I can, I\u2019ve\nloved working with talented people and there\u2019s\nnothing more rewarding than being taken seriously by people you set out to collaborate with.\nhajan \u2013 The Destroyer of Worlds, today & tomorrow\nPerhaps the most well known principle of photographic composition is the \u201cRule of Thirds\u201d.\nIt is one of the most basic tools that can be used\nto create balanced and visually appealing shots.\nHowever, before we get into it I must warn you\nthat rules are meant to be broken and ignoring\nthis one does not mean that your pictures will\nnecessarily be unbalanced or uninteresting. In\nfact, the opposite can often be true!\nWhat is the Rule of Thirds?\nPut very simply, the basic principle is to break\nan image down into thirds both horizontally\nand vertically so that you have 9 parts (as seen\nin the picture to the right). Now keeping this\ngrid in mind, the \u201crule of thirds\u201d gives you four\nlines - two horizontal and two vertical - that\ncan be used to help you compose your shot.\nTry positioning the points of interest in your\npicture either along one of the lines or at the\nintersections.\nQuick tip: some digital cameras can overlay\nthe rule of thirds grid on top of the viewfinder to make this a lot easier, so have a browse\naround in the menu to see if you can find it.\nThe theory is that by placing the points of interest in accordance with the \u201crule of thirds\u201d,\nyour picture will look more visually balanced\nand it will be easier for the viewer to focus on\nthe object of interest. Studies have shown that\nwhen viewing an image, people\u2019s eyes usually\ngo to one of the intersection points more naturally than to the centre of the photograph; so by\nusing the \u2018rule of thirds\u2019 your picture will work\nwith the viewer rather than against them.\nApplying the \u201crule of thirds\u201d to your photography comes naturally to some photographers but it can take a little practice for it to\nbecome second nature. Once again, remember\nthat breaking the rule can result in some striking shots too, so once you have learnt it experiment with purposely breaking it to see what\nyou discover.\nFinally, keep the \u201crule of thirds\u201d in mind as\nyou subsequently edit your photos. Photo editing tools today have good features for cropping\nand reframing images so that they fit better\nwith the rule. Experiment with some of your\nold pictures to see what impact it has.\nIf you would like to learn more about com-position, or anything else to do with photogra-phy, then get involved with the Photographic\nSociety.\nYou can find out more at our website:\nunion.ic.ac.uk/photosoc or you can email\nus at photosoc@imperial.ac.uk\nImprove your digital photos with\nPhotosoc: The Rule Of Thirds\nJonathan Kim\nThe Destroyer of Worlds by Pranav Mahajan\nfor ICSM Drama is on today and tomorrow.\nThe Dark Side by Shamini Bundell runs\nfrom 8th - 11th December.\nImperial Collage for Musical Theatre\nSociety by Gilead Amit runs 12th - 13th\nDecember\nIf you\u2019d like to direct a play next term for\nDramsoc, play proposals are on the 3rd\nDecember.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 26 NOVEMBER 2010\n8\nFirst person\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhy I protested, by Caroline Clark\nA wave of student occupations has been sparked off\nby mass protests taking place all over the country.\nStudents from UCL, London South Bank University,\nBirmingham, Warwick, Oxford, Strathclyde, Cardiff,\nDundee, University of East London, Portsmouth,\nLeeds, Royal Holloway, SOAS, Manchester Metropolitan and UWE Bristol have all gone into occupation this week.\nIn London, 5000 students converged on Trafalgar Square and attempted to march down Whitehall\nto Lib Dem HQ. However, in stark contrast to the\nNUS protest, it soon became apparent that the police wanted absolute control. They kettled the main\nmarch for 10 hours in the cold before releasing\nthem in handfuls at around 10pm.\nWhen we arrived at 5pm, a group of 1000 students and workers stood outside one end of the\nkettle. We tried to join those inside, but could only\nstand outside in solidarity. The police pushed us towards Trafalgar Square with horses and batons. At\none point, without warning, the line of police horses\ncharged the crowd. Panic erupted and people ran\ndown the street or tried to jump over a wall to safety.\nWe were impressed by the scale of demonstrations yesterday and proud to be part of them. They\ncame only two weeks after the largest student demonstration since 1987, during which thousands occupied the courtyard of Tory HQ. This sparked an\nintense media and police backlash, leading to the\naggressive tactics used by the police yesterday.\nHowever, many support the protesters, including\ntrade unions and lecturers.\nThe savage cuts announced by the coalition government will resonate through Higher and Further\nEducation, with fears that 22,000 university jobs\nwill be lost and fees of \u00a39000 a year threatening\nto carve a layer of poorer students from university\neducation. Allowing a market in education will create\na two-tier education system; only the privileged elite\nwill be able to afford to study at the top universities.\nAaron Porter stated that he \u201cabsolutely condemns\nthe actions of violence\u201d at Millbank. However, broken windows are insignificant compared to the damage that will be done to everyone by the governments cuts. In itself breaking windows won\u2019t change\nthe position of the government, but it shows workers\nthat it is possible to fight back, giving them confidence to strike. As we have seen from history, civil\ndisobedience is a powerful force that is an integral\npart in bringing down a government. Through actions\nlike this, the Heath government came crashing down\nin the early 70\u2019s and Thatcher was brought down\nafter the poll tax riots.\nOur Union President may be attempting to distance himself from the growing student rebellion,\nbut growing numbers of Imperial students are showing that they\u2019re prepared to get out and march. The\nprotests, strikes and occupations we\u2019ve seen so far\nall hint that an enormous wave of organised resistance to the government is on its way.\nAt Imperial, those involved in the demonstration\nyesterday will be holding an organising meeting early\nnext week \u2013 look out for posters on the walkway or\nemail swss@ic.ac.uk. Everyone is welcome to join us.\nJust as the anti-poll tax campaign ended the Thatcher era, so too is it possible for protests, occupations\nand direct action to break today\u2019s government\nCaroline Clark is the Chair of the Socialist Workers\nStudents\u2019 Society at Imperial.\nStudents around the U\nanger grows over educ\nStudents have once again clashed with\npolice during protests over proposed\nchanges to higher education. The pro-test, the second this month, planned to\ntarget the Liberal Democrat headquarters in central London.\nThousands of students and school\npupils gathered around Whitehall and\nTrafalgar Square to fight against government plans to raise tuition fees and cuts\nto university teaching grants and the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA)\nViolence escalated quickly as one police\nofficer had his arm broken and with was\ndragged from the crowd unconscious\nwith leg injuries. The police deployed\nthe controversial \u2018kettling\u2019 technique\nused at the G20 protests. Bottles and\nplacards were thrown at police and fires\nwere started as darkness fell.\nVandals damaged and graffitied a police van stranded in the protest. School\nchildren who disagreed with the vio-lence, however, formed a protective\nshield around the van to prevent further\ndamage. Later protesters broke into a\nvan, smashing the windows, stealing\npolice uniforms and using the van as a\ndance platform.\nThe demonstration, organised by several groups, began peacefully with a\n\u201cCarnival of Resistance\u201d at 11am, starting at Malet Street and progressing to\nTrafalgar Square, where students from\nacross the nation assembled prior to\nthe planned protest outside of the Liberal Democrat\u2019s headquarters in Central\nLondon and later in Downing Street.\nHowever, in light of the Millbank Riots two weeks ago, police detained protesters in the Whitehall area before they\nreached Parliament Square. Attempts to\nbreak through the police cordon were\nunsuccessful, a stark contrast to the attack on Conservatives\u2019 headquarters a\nfortnight ago.\nOrganisers, who have dubbed the\nmass demonstration \u201cDay X\u201d, are calling students to protest against the Liberal Democrat party leaders, accusing\nthem of breaking their promised pledge\nof voting against a hike in tuition fees.\nTuition fees are set to soar to \u00a39000\nper year by September 2012, with plans\nto withdraw public funding for arts-based university subjects and removing\nthe EMA which is paid to students who\nwould otherwise not be able to remain in\neducation past the age of 16.\nProtests, walk-outs and marches took\nplace across the country. The largest were\nin Manchester (3000), Bristol (2000),\nSheffield (2000) and Brighton where\n3000 students marched. There were also\ndemonstrations in Glasgow, Edinburgh,\nNewcastle, Liverpool, Southampton,\nOxford, Cambridge, Bournemouth and\nCardiff. Occupations were also staged\nin colleges and universities including\nSOAS, London South Bank, Royal Holloway, UCL, Essex and UWE Bristol.\nNick Clegg, in a speech made on\nTuesday night, pleaded with students to\n\u201cListen and look before you march and\nshout. Our plans will mean that many of\nthe lowest income graduates will repay\nless than they do under the current system.\u201d The Deputy Prime Minister, who\nhas been warned against cycling to work\namidst fears he could be attacked, was\nfurther targeted by angry protesters who\nhung an effigy outside a building where\nhe was due to give a speech on Tuesday.\nMany school children attended the\nprotests on Wednesday. Milly, aged\n14, from a north London school, said\nshe had attended the protests as they\nwere relevant to her and that she would\nbe \u201cone of the people affected by the\nchanges\u201d. Her friend Harry, also 14, said\nthat they agreed with the protests, but\ndisagreed with the violence, saying \u201cit\nwon\u2019t achieve anything\u201d.\nAnother protester, a current student\nat UCL, said, \u201cViolence gets our point\nacross, they can see how strongly we\nfeel and it will make them change what\nthey have said\u201d. Most people that we\nspoke to believed that the violence was\nsending the wrong message across about\nstudents and that those who were being\nviolent were out looking for trouble,\nrather than protesting for the cause.\nSixty arrests have been made so far\nfollowing the occupation of Millbank\ntwo weeks ago. Student Edward Woollard, 18, from Southampton, is facing\njail after admitting throwing a fire extinguisher from a rooftop during the violent\nriot. Woollard has been charged with\nviolent disorder, an offence that carries\na maximum of five years in prison.\nOlivia Ribeiro\nKirsty Seager\nMilly, aged 14, said\nshe had attended\nthe protests as she\nwas \u201cone of the people affected by the\nchanges\u201d\nPhoto by Miles Robertson\nA protestor climbs onto a building at Whitehall\nPhoto by Olivia Ribeiro\nPolice were far better prepared this time around\n\n"

A fire alarm at\naround midnight was met by groans from\nstudents who quickly became restless\nwaiting in the cold outside.
