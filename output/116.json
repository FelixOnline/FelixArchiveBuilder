    "content": "2 FELIX Cat*ahead, an inconspicuous Tyneeide\ntown waa wakened to life on the morning\nof Maroh 9th1937, a violent exp los ion, otherwise known as George Martin,\ntook place. The tremors are still being\nfelt in such far-flung districts as\nFrance, Switzerland and Kensington.\nGateshead Grammar School, a co-educational establishment, was the first\nvictim of this seismic oat as tr up he. It\nwas here that George made hi a mark In\n\u2022port. He swam, played rugby for one\n1st XV for 3 years, and, was reserve\nfor Durham Schoolboys. Towards the\nend of this school career he was\nthrown out of the girls' Prefects'\nBoom seventeen times and finally left\nschool with a State Scholarship, a e oll sc tion of rugby songs and a sigh\nof relief from the staff. Soon after,\nand in the light of previous experience,\nthe a oho ol reverted to the segregation\nof the sexes.\nOn coming to I.C. he played for the\n'A' team, ?nde and l sts. He is now\ncaptain of I.C. seconds and Guild's first teams, playing prop, and took\npart in the I.C. Bogby Club tour to\nFrames last Christmas.\nHowever, George's interests are not\nlimited to the rugby field. Ho has\nbeen known to drink a pint standing\non his head, and is the resident\n\"Blaydon Races\" singer of the College.\nHe enjoys \"mu ek in' about in foreign\nparts\". He as hitch-hiked through\nSwitierland and Italy, being arrested\nby the oar i bl nie ri on one ooo as ion. His hostel room is adorned by 71 beer\nmats, 6 sherry labels, a mirror kindly\ndonated by Messrs, Tollemaohe, a Keep\nLeft sign and a Belisha beacon ( a present from the Metropolitan Police),\nand a lifes ii e photograph of Miss\nBrigltte Bardot.\nHis likes are a quiet pint of beer,\nteddy bears and Ursula. His dislikes\ninclude mild, teddy boys, women who\nsmoke and \"Goons who try to Interview\nyon\". His plan a for the future include\nresearch and rugby. Wo wish him luck.\nLADIES' ICEHOCKEY The loo Skating Club held a meeting at the Arosa Rink, Richmondt\non January 17th. In retrospect,\nover a pint in the local tavern, it was considered by those present,\nsome twenty members of the Club,\nthat it had been one of the most\nenjoyable and successful meetings\nover held there.\nSeveral vigorous sessions of\nloo Hockey were interspersed with\ngeneral skating. Two teams of\nladies were formed by military persuasion and the resulting game,\nthough bloodless, would have put\nSt. Trinians to 3hara e. The referee\nwas ignored and one of the goalies,\nhaving let the puck through early\nin the game prevented a recurrence\nby removing the goal with the assistance of a group of male supporters.\nAltogether about 55 were present,\nincluding skaters from some of the\nwomen's Colleges; the next meeting\nis in March. The membership of the\no lub is increasing rapidly, apparently\nas a result of the recent cold weather.\nMOURNING IN There was great lamentation and\ngnashing of teeth in R.C.S. on the\nafternoon of Thursday January 16th. The object of their sorrow was the\nuntimely exposure of their president\nto the prying eyes of the public.\nResponsible, of course, were the man\nof C. and G., still enraged by the\nremoval of their pride and joy. But\nlet us recapitulate the sequence of\nevents leading to this startling\nrevelation.\nNear 1 o 'clock on the aforesaid\nday Mr. Stevens invited Mr. Butters\nto his room, so that they might attend\nthe C. and G. Union Meeting together,\nthe latter to oo lle ota pair of his\ntrousers recently acquired by the\nformer. However, on entering the\nR.C.S. president was bound and gagged\nby a selection of the b e3tC. and G. brawn.\nHence, wrapped in a shroud, not\nunlike a hostel curtain, and tied\nwith a large red ribbon, he was\ntransported into Guilds. With the\nsolemnity befitting the oo as sion he was borne Into the Union Meeting\nand lay In state while the official\nbusiness began at 1.15 p.m. The meeting was dominated by\ntalk of the Spanner and the advisability\nof mounting it; another committee was\nformed to consider the matter more fully.\nMr. Stevens gave details of the\nloss of the Spanner. He had received a somewhat Juvenile\nletter last term that R.C.S. had the\nSpanner, but was given no clue as to\nits whereabouts, which are still unknown,\neven to R.C.S. He found the whole\nbusiness \"distasteful.\"\nIndicating the shroud, Mr. Stevens\nremarked: \"We have here a great friend\nof mine who kindly volunteered to attend\nthis meeting.\" He added that an ultimatum had been i sued to R.C.S. to the\neffect that they had until 2.05 p.m. to\nproduce the Spanner in return for their\npresident. \"Non-oom pli ance with this\nwill lead to our Guest being released\nin less than his usual attire in a prominent locality.\"\nThere being no sign of the Spanner\nat 2.05 p.m., the meeting was asked\nfor suggestions of places where Mr.\nButters might be un shrouded. Harroda,\nBuckingham Palace, Downing Street were\namong those suggested,but it was felt\nthat the Albert Memorial would su ff ioe due to its proximity.\nTHE AFTERNOON The Corpse was borne to Bo' and\nthe *mou mi ng\"procession meandered to\nthe Memorial via R.C.S. causing complete\ncessation of vehicular traffic. The\ndoors of R.C.S. were bolted and secured,\ndeathly white faces peered at the\nmultitudinous procession. As a \"Booraalaka\" thundered to a caterwauling\ncrescendo, the very walls reverberated\nwith fear.\nTriumphantly the procession moved\nto the Albert Hall, whence the \"Corpse\"\nwas borne into the hallowed precincts\nof the Albert Memorial. Here he waa\nenshrouded, deprived of his dignity\nand made to walk between two lines of\nGuildsmen to the Albert Hall, where he\nescaped into a taxi.\nA band of expectant girls, held\nin pregnant suspense by the spectacle\nwere unfortunately unable to catch\nmore than a fleeting glimpse of the\nde trouser ed president.\nA bouquet for Derek Butters for\nbeing such a sport.\nA raspberry far the Chelsea Polioe\nwho arrived too late to join in the\nfun.\nQuote of the day:\n\"We know R.C.S. are effeminate, but this is the first\ntime one has become a mummy.

    "content": "6 FELIX5^ MV5 A/ CLUB IN THE ALPS Thirty members of I.C. Ski Club\nleft Victoria on Saturday 21st December\nfor a fortnight's ski-ins (and she-lng)\nin the Tyrolean Alps.\nOn arrival in the small winter\nsports resort of Soelden (4550 feet)\nthe party, which included several\nattractive female members, split into\ntwo, one half remaining at the Hotel\nPost and the other going on to the\nPension Gystrein. That evening the\nfir3 t of many encounters was made\nwith \"Wiener Schnitzel\" and \"Spezial\nBier,\" and the peculiar Austrian bed\ncovers.\nThe following day wa3 spent in\nhiring skis and boots and in trying\nto find some snow to ski on. Through\nsome hard work by Otto Jakubovic some\nsnow was finally found, and on Christmas\nSve the whole party started ski-ing lessons under the instruction of the local\n\"Sk\u00b13Chul e,\" Wayne Piatt getting into\nthe top class.\nThat evening a very pleasant time\nwas had in the Pension Gystrein, which\nwas decorated with a Jocal Christmas\ntree, and many well known and some lesser la iom carols were sung.\nOn Christmas Night the management\ndidn't share the festive spirit, and\nafter unplugging the \"Juke Boa\"\nthreatened to throw everyone out.\nHowever, Clem Lemayre came to the\nrescue and produced, seemingly Out\nof a hat, a party complete with strong\ndrink, hot music, and French women, in\na neighbouring Guest House.\nAlthough snow conditions degenerated\nand in spite of the gay nights, most of\nthe beginners graduated to higher ol as s es at Hochsoelden (6830 feet) after a few days. This latter resort is over\n2000 feet higher than Soelden, and\nvirtually the only way of reaching it is by a20 minute ride in a \"Ses3el-bahn\" or chair-lift, the 3eo on d longest of its kind in Austria. Passengers\nare apt to get very chilly in transit:\non one occasion a certain member of the\nclub had several beers before leaving\nthe top, and was forced by the cold air to relieve himself, on the way down.\nBy New Year's Eve everyone was on\nintimate terms and the Old Year was\nseen out in the conventional and some\nunconventional manners. Even the shy\nAmerican girl let her hair down on this\noccasion.\nThe large number of sprained knees\nand twisted ankles reflected the\nworsening snow conditions after\nthe New Year. Happily no one was\nseriously injured, but several\npeople can still be seen limping\naround the college.\nA comfortable journey back to\nEngland was marred by an extremely\nrough Channel crossing during which\nmost people lost their breakfasts.\nHowever a very enjoyable time had\nbe<m had by all and the standard of\nski-ing in I.C. has been greatly\nimproved.\nCLUB REVIEW/ fC AWEIGH Many members of the Sailing\nClub are to be seen discussing\nboats in the Union during the lunch\nhour. This is an indication of\ntheir interest in the College fleet\nof 5 Fireflies, which they sail, race,\nand maintain.\nThe Firefly is a light twelve foot\nracing dinghy which, for its size, has\naye ry high performance. In a strong\nwind it will lift up and plane over\nthe water like a speed boat, giving\nits occupants a tremendous sensation\nof speed and a generous cold shower;\nit will also give the unwary ao old bath when it is least expected.\nBeing a racing boat, comfort is not\nvery well catered for and there is\nlittle space for stowing more than\na bottle of beer and a packet of sandwiches (well wrapped up in something\nwaterproof). Although such a small\nboat, it will sail well on the sea,\nbut on such a trip the baile r is the\nmost important member of the crew.\nMost of the club's sailing is\ndone on the Welsh Harp, are servo Lr of dubious origin and use, near the\nNorth Circular and Ed^ware Uoads.\nIt is about three-quarters or a idle\nloop and wide enough for people to\nget lost in a mist.\nLast Summer most of the I.C. boats\nwere taken to Heme Bay to give members\nexperience of sailing on big waves.\nThis turn e.3 out to be quite some\nexperience and many tales will live on.\nThere was the time X gave a thrilling\nbut uncontrolled exhibition of aerobatics in a Firefly before disappearing\nin a cloud of spray. There was also\nthe ti:ne that Salome, a rather temperamental and very un ladylike lorry used\nfor carrying boats was apprehended by\nthe Police for having no silencer and\n\"no audible warning of approach\" - as\nif she needed one J The Polioe were\nmore friendly later: One constable\nhelped to push Salome along Southend\nPromenade to start her.\nTHE ISLAND SITE LATEST MODEL Last Monday the revised development scheme for the Island site was laid before\nthe Planning Committee of the L.C.C. The photograph above shows the model of the\nnew plan as viewed from the East. The Coleutt tower, set in a two-aere lawn figures prominently. As can be seen, it will serve as an excellent sundial. Perhapi\nthe Planning Offioe o an be induced to calibrate the row of windows facing it Salome's presence at Southend was\nthe result of The University attending\nthe Firefly championships at We3tcliff,\nall five I.C. boats being present\nDinghy racing is a very satisfying\n3port as it demands both physical and\nmental agility together with a sense\nof humour. Stephen Potter would, no\ndoubt, be able to write a good book\non racing tactics, especially those\nused in team racing, where it is the\naggregate position of a team of three\nboats and not an individual boat's placing which counts.\nSailing is essentially a sport\nto take part in and not to watch - a race is very hard for an onlooker on\nthe 3h ore to follow and is usually\nregarded as somewhat of a mysterious\nproceed ure by the general public.\nThe natives who frequent t ne shores\nof the 't fels h Harp seem completely amazed\nby the queer beings who go out sailing\nthe foulest of weather. All I can say\nis that we wouldn't risk a swim in\nJanuary if it wasn't worth it lSA DAP S MrBCozen3Wcruldbeextremelygratefulif\nthe per eon who borrowed the leg of hi a night commode w cul d return the same.

    "content": "FELIX5 BLOODY RUBBISH?\nDear Sir,\nPhoenix has received an abundance\nof vague censure of the \"bloody rub-b ish\" variety, and since the primary\nobject of any magazine is to satisfy\nthose who buy it we must admit that\nthere is something wrong. However,\nthe only really constructive comments\nwere tho so in p.4 of FELIX, and even\nthis rook fc. was ineffective through\nlack of guidance. The fifteen hundred\nagreed with every word as if it was\nsomeone else's can. Let us be quite\no lear as to where the blame lies or\nwe shall make no progress.\nThere seems to be a widespread\nimpression that the mag. has been\ncorrupted by a perverted editor or\neditors selecting only the worst for\npublication. In fact,'the activities\nand interests of the college' have\nbeen reflected only too well, and\nthey apparently do not include writing.\nWithout wishing to deny a hearing to\nany ari tio who is not also a contrib u tor, I would estimate that if one per\ncent of our connoisseurs of literature\nwould demonstrate their perfect taste\nby producing a few items as good as\n\u2022Short History of Space\", our troubles\nwould be over. If we want Phoenix to\nrise again we must first identify the\nashes.\nYours sincerely,\nFred Wheeler.\nLIGHTEN OUR DARKNESS\nDear Sir,\nIf The Phoenix should get the bird\nthen the students' magazines I have\nJust road, The Isis of Oxford University\nand Lucifer of Kings College London,\nshould get the brontosaurus 1\n. Neither\nhad even a single page about the societies and sport of their readers; indeed,\nThe Isis, w hio his a smaller magazine\nthan our own, had twice as many words\nabout Albert Camus than Ian Hill wrote\nfor The Phoenix. Who, in Imperial\nCollege, had heard about this writer\nwho had Just won the Nobel prize for\nliterature? Hardly anyone except Ian\nHill who wrote a brilliant readable\nbiography of him.\nNo, no, no Mr. P.H. L., The Phoenix\nis not another FELIX, it la not another\nRector's Bulletin, it is a platform\nwhere any students can express themselves\nin any way. And if Mr. P.H. L. oared to\nread the last edition of The Phoenix,\nand I sincerely doubt whether he has\nread even a quarter of the words, he\nwould then see what a variety of\nexpression there was. Yes, here was\noriginal thought reflecting the life and interests of a wide set of live\nand interesting students. The Phoenix\nhad for on oe ceased to grovel at the\nbottom of the Imperial College test\ntube; it had tried to breathe the\nfresh air of the university outside.\nThe last issue was the Autumn\nedition which is inevitably short of\nsociety and sports news as so little happens in the Summer term. Add to\nthis the extreme difficulties of\nproducing The- Phoenix last term be-o a use of the late indisposition of its Editor and the lack of 00-operation from\nsports writers, and you will realise\nhow it came about that The Phoenix had\nless of tii is kind of material than I had wanted. I am looking forward to\nreceiving contributions from all those like Mr. P.E.L. who were disappointed .\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR SCRAP IT\nI am glad to learn that there was\na spark of originality about Clotty.\nFor me it was a great pleasure to have\nencouraged a valiant band at writers\nwhose versatility and Originality was\na veritable beacon of light in our\ndarkness.\nYours sincerely,\nPeter Jarman.\nMr. Jarman appears to be reading\ninto my review things that I just did\nnot say. However, I fully comprehend\nhis inability to understand 3imp le English, and will therefore try to\nclarify matters.\nFirst of all, in maintaining that\nTHE PHOENIX should reflect the activities and interests of the College,\nand citing \"Light Metallurgy\" and the\nGuineas advertisement as examples, I was NOT proposing that it should\ncontain accounts of social and sporting\nevents.\nSecondly I emphasised originality.\nTHE PHOENIX should certainly be a platform for originality but not for\nIan Hill to stand up and recite quotations in praise of Albert Camus.\n(The profile in THE ISIS \u2014 twice the\nlength: ten quotations? \u2014 is obviously\nmore suited to an University in which\nthe Faculty of Arts predominates. How\nabout a profile of Professor Blackett\nor Sir Alexander Fleck for THE PHOENIX?)\nMr. Jarman makes the usual taunt\nthat those who criticise should con tri bute. I would g lady submit an editorial\nsaying exactly what his said and using\none fifth of his words to do so, did I think that it merited any words at all. We have the clue to Jarman's attitude in his letter. \"Who, in\nImperial College, had heard about\nthis writer who had just won the\nNobel prize for literature? Hardly\nanyone....\" Here is Jarman in a nutshell. Here is Jarman's opinion\nof his fellow men. HERE IS JARMAN\nTHE INTELLECTUAL SNOB, the in stiller of culture into the grovelling masses.\nI would surmise that it was the aura of\nintellectual snobbishness enveloping\nthe last PHOENIX that has irritated so\nmany readers. A beacon of light in\nour darkness? Hsj-dlya glow won ul P.H. Levin.\n0^\nDear Sir,\nWe wish to report that \"City and\nGuilds\" was successfully disinfected\non the 20th January. It was also\nnoted that Guildamen were seen staggering about with tears in their\neyes, probably weeping over a \"Lost\nSpanner.\"\nIt. CHE. MISTS.\nDear Sirs,\nIt seems reas oi,* Me to assume\nthat the Imperial Institute tower will have to remain in the new Imperial\nCollege, so as to satisfy the Victorian lovers of the Kensington Society. I wish, there-fore, to pu%\nforward the following suggestions for\nmaking the eyesore as un-noticeable\nas possible.\n1. Dig a pit 280 ft. deep and sink\nthe folly completely, providing\nhydraulic lifting gear for ceremonial occasions.\n2. Build a high parapet wall round\nthe top of the highest building to\nbe built on the island site, and re-erect the top part of the tower,\nincluding the bells, for sentimental\nand ceremonial occasions.\n3. Dig a long trench and bury the\nwhole thing in a horizontal position;\nthen convert the inside into a rifle range, so we can have shooting\npractice on the persons who want it retained.\n4. Sell the whole of Imperial\nInstitute to an American oil king\nfor \u00a3250,000, and then we could\nhave a new income for cultural purposes in the College.\nYours faithfully,\nK.G. Reader.\nHIGH FINANCE\nDear Sir,\nIn the last issue Nelson reports\nthat a cross-country runner suggests\nrunning behind a taxi to save the\nmaximum fares. This joke is, of\ncourse, well known, and as old as\nsome of the taxis. It may interest\nNelson to know that a similar amusing\nillogical it y is often put forward\nseriously, as an attempt at con versa tion. As a non-smoker, I often meet\nthe remark:\"How lucky I Think of the\nmoney you sive l\" However, Nelson and I know that\nthe amount is chicken-feed, compared\nwith what I save by not investing in\ndud gold-mines, and by not keeping\ntwo villas in the South of France.\nYours sincerely,\nR.F. Streater.\nWOT NO LIBRARY\nDear Sir,\nIn the October issue of the\n\"Rector's Bulletin,\" I read that\nthere is now a College General\nLibrary. Apparently this has been\nformed on the basis of the old Union\nLibrary wh i oh no longer exists.\nThis change has, to my knowledge,\nnever baen announced to a Union Meeting,\nalthough it is a matter of considerable\nimportance to all concerned.\nIt may well be that the Union will\nbenefit by the change, but should it not\nhave been discussed at a General Meeting,\ninstead of being presented as a fait\nac comp li? Yours faithfully,\nJohn K. Taylor.\n\n"

    "content": "4 FELIX VIEWPOINT\nGUEST MEMBERS OF THE UNION EDITOR: PETER LEVIN\nCIRCULATION ISOO\nZETA The control of the hydrogen-bomb\nreaction in Zeta, the zero-energy\nthermonuclear appliance,is a tremendous scientific accomplishment. It\n\u2022sill be recalled that a group in the\nPhysios Department here was working\non this project under Professor Sir George Thomson until 1950, when it became too hot to handle, and then\nremoved to Aldermaston, where\nSoeptre, a gadget similar to Zeta,\nis now In operation.\nIn contrast to the sputnik, this\nachievement is tremendously important\nin that it signposts the way directly\nto a rise in the standard of living\nof millions of Asians and Africans\nwho now dwell in mud huts and exist\non next to nothing. However, the\napplications of technology to the\nbetterment of man are very mu oh neglected nowadays, and our own\nsociety has fully demonstrated its inability to cope with automation,\nfor example. The moral is that\nwhile scientists and technologists\nmay produce these marvellous things,\nit is vital that we concern ourselves\nwith their application as well. Otherwise the benefits of Zeta may easily\nbe lost.\nThe third of the model study bedrooms\nfor the Prlnoo's Gardens Hostel is at\npresent under construction by the\narchitects, Richard Sheppard and\nPartners, and will probably be used\nas the prototype for the Hostel. It\nis due to be completed shortly. We\nhope to have a complete description\nin our next issue.\nMORPHY BOAT LAT \u00a3 ST The I.C. Boat Club light o linker eight, which was severely damaged on\nMorphy Day by a Wandsworth Borough\nCouncil lorry, is now being repaired,\nbut will be of no use as a racing eight\nin future; the boat builders cannot\nguarantee that the boat will be fit for\nuse at all. The loss of the club's be3t eight clinker at a time when our\nexpansion scheme is in operation, is\na severe blow.\nWandsworth Borough Council has\nbeen approached over the matter but\ndenies any liability. At an Extraordinary General Meeting the Club\nCaptain and Vioe-Captain were unanimously elected the plaintiffs for\nthe club, in the event of a court\no a se.A writ has been issued on the\nCotaaoil.\nAlthough the behaviour of the\nCouncil employees is not condoned\nit is to be hoped that in future a little more sense may be uae d in the\nthrowing of flour on such occasions.\nRecent visitors to Touchstone\nweekends may have noticed that it has\nbecome part of the Policy of the\nGeneral Studies Committee to invite\na small proportion of outsiders, from\nneighbouring colleges, to take part\nin our discussions.\nThis has proved very successful,\nour visitors have shown themselves\nvery able and interesting people,\nbringing with them new ideas and view-pointS'Which are unlikely to be encountered in a purely scientific\ngathering.\nWe are, without doubt, rather a biassed College from the point of\nview of education, yet our neighbours\nwith different backgrounds and\ntraditions might just as well come\nfrom outer space, so little do we see\nof them.\nI feel that this is a sad reflection on our organization, and I hope\nthere are none among us who are so\nnarrow minded as to think it an advantage. The Union and the College spend\nconsiderable amounts of money on ways\nand means of broadening our outlook,\nbut the ugly fact remains that I.C. is a specialist's paradise, with few\noutside interests apart from sex and\nbeer.\nOne of the causes of this, the\n9 to 5 student is being tackled\nenergetically, by both Union and\nCollege authorities by the provision\nof New Hostels and Union facilities,\nbut another, our complete subservience\nto the disciplines of science and its applications, has not been touched.\nThat we should remain the Imperial\nCollege of Science and Technology is an economic and administrative necessity and therefore is not feasible\nfor the College authorities to assist\nour education here.\nIt is true that Union fees might\nprove a stumbling block, but one\nwould hope it is hot beyond the ingenuity of Union Council, if so dire c ted, to formulate a change in constitution covering this.\nEducation has be. n said to consist\nmainly of o on tact between students -the older provincial universities are\ntypical examples.\nOur degrees may be on a par with\nthose of these institutions, but I beg to suggest we are not educated.\nEven when we reach the promised\nland of a residential College, the\nprospect of 2,000 half-fledged scientists in their cubby\u2014holes can hardly\nbe said to be alluring.\nIt has been suggested that to\nleaven this somewhat doughy mass some\nhostel rooms be reserved for members\nof, say, the Royal College of Art.\nThis seems an excellent idea but at\npresent of little use, because our\nSocieties are closed shops, and\ncliques would be inevitable. It is\ntime that the student body gave a lead\nin this matter. Our neighbours would\nprovide a welcome shot in the arm for\nmost of our societies; no one genuinely interested would mind competition and the difference in viewpoint\nwould prove most stimulating. Perhaps until such time as a new concept\nof our Union can evolve we could\ninvite our neighbours as Guest Members\nto our societies.\nAs I see it, the only losers would\nbe our narrow minded friends disturbed\nfrom their rut of self sufficiency.\nD. Bridgwater.\nFOREIGN COMPETITION\nDear Sir,\nI cannot agree with your remark\nin the issue of 17th January, in which\nyou state \"This seems unfortunate since\nmany I.C. men were turned away later\"\nin refer eno e to the entry of L.S.E. and King's men to the first hop of term.\nIf I.C. men wish to attend the hops\nthey have ample opportunity to purchase\ntickets in the preceding week. Do you\nsuggest that \"foreigners* should be\nturned away In case some I.C. men\nhaven't made up their minds?\nWe are frequently urged in your\ncolumns to mix more with non-scientists,\nand quite rightly so. However, unless\nmen are prepared to go to the trouble\nof seeking out fresh minds outside the\nCollege - by attending U.L. U. functions,\nor by joining a University Society - they\nare left with the Saturday hop as the\nonly alternative. I would suggest that\nmen who attend only I.C. functions are\nprecisely those who need to meet out-side rs, and who stand to gain most from\nthe conflict.\nBy all means let's hare I.C. hops\nfor I.C. men, but don't discourage outsiders just hon an so some I.C. men are\ntoo idle to think two days ahead.\nTours faithfully,\nTed Bates.\nVITAL STATISTICS\nDear Sir,\nAccording to a bank statement I have recently received, I have had\ntransactions with the following:-\"City Guilds College\"\n... That typist can't type ...\n\"City College\"\n... must be the one \"Felix\"\nemploys . . .\nand \"In peril a College*\n... 3he has a sense of humour\nanyway.\nShe also has a very nice figure.\nYours etc.,\nF. Peacock.\nAPOLOGY\nDear Sir,\nMr. J.K. Taylor is o or rect: the\nChurch Society is not yet entitled to\nprefix the name of Imperial College.\nWe apologise for this misuse,\nwhich occurs in the Prorisigial\nGeneral Studies programme for this\nterm.\nYours sincerely,\nPeter Swans.\n\n"

Conditions on the airfield\nwere fair iy good, although a cold wind\nmade a saloon car the most enviable\nprospect.\nSome light entertainment was provided before the start by John Thurston,\nwho decided to try out his brakes\nwithout realizing that he was on a patch of gravel. The result was some\nvery interesting circular motion\nculminating in a tyre burst. The start\nthen had to be delayed while he put his\nspare wheel on, which appeared to have\nthe air showing through in several\nplaces.\nThe first test was a forward and\nreverse wiggle w ogg le, in which the\nsmaller cars found that they had a definite advantage. It was followed\nMOCK PARLIAMENT At the first Mock Parliament\nwhich sat in Ayrton Hall on Thursday\na government provided by the Conservative Society was assailed and supported\nby about forty allegedly independent\nM.P.s. After a statement of policy by\nthe Prime Minister and a reply by the\nleader of the opposition, the house\ndebated a motion of confidence in the\ngovernment's financial policy. The\ngovernment was itself oozing confidence\nbut could not spread any of it to the\nopposition.\nA bill to rest riot the o a pital of\nTrade Unions failed to get its seo on d reading after a violent debate wh i oh served principally to expose the main\ndifferences between government and\nopposition.\ni he last item on the order paper\nwas a debate on foreign affairs, with\nparticular reference to the hydrogen\nbomb. All the our rent top ios received\nmention, some in great detail. Perhaps\nhowever, the suggestion of replacing\nthe Suez Canal by bicycle-borne water-ing-o an s was intended to be frivolous.\nThe debate was prolonged by many interjections on points of order and information of varied nature.\nThe opposition pressed for a division in wh i oh the government suffered\na major defeat.

Here\nspectators were treated to the sight\nof a T.R.3 disappearing into the distance with locked wheels. Next came\na garaging test, in which John\nThurston put up the fastest time,\nbald tyres notwithstanding.\nThe wheel changing test which\nfollowed really separated the sheep\nfrom the goats; T.

The best time\nwas put up by J. White, in a Morris\nspecial, at the expense of a good deal\nof rubber.\nThe next test defies description,\ninvolving a little bit of everything.\nThe final one was a sprint including\na figure of eight, in which W. Wiltshier managed to lift one wheel of his\nVauxhall 10 saloon at least 12 inches\nin the air.\nH.

He did not think that man1s concept of God could withstand such a rigorous examination.\nThe Rev.\nCleverley Ford thought Dr. Allan was\noff the point, and that when he had\nbeen on the point, his explanation of\nlife had been far too small. Mr. J.D. Cole spent his time in demonstrating\nitems of illogical it yin Mr. Ford's speech, while Mr. David New said that\nthe law of discovering the truth of\nthings also applied outside the labor a tory.\nSpeeches from the floor had to be\ncurtailed, unfortunately, owing to lack\nof time, but the Chairman, Mr. Peter\nJarman.had a distinctly realistic\napproach to this problem. The Rev.\nCleverley Ford in his summary pointed\nout that some Christians work as well\nas pray, while Dr. Allan, in sura i ing up, said that the number of ears deaf\nto religion was increasing. At this\npoint a frightful bearded gentleman\nentered the Geology Lecture Theatre\nand said: \"Time,gentlemen,please\"\nso loudly that not even the deafest\nears could fail to hear. The motion\nwas defeated by 16 votes to 10 with\na large number of abstentions.\nThe remainder of this term's debates will, it is hoped, be held in\nthe Concert Hall. On February 11th the College is being visited by a touring American team, who are said to\nbe first class.

From the moment\nwhen Solway put I,C. ahead with a cracking shot from the edge of the\nci role they held the initiative\nthroughout and might well have won\nby more than two goals.\nThe following day was a totally\ndifferent story. In the U.L. Cup\nmatch ( Znd. round replay ) U.C. beat\nI.C.51. Kewaon, an ex-U.L. hookey\ncaptain, was on top form for U.C. and\nopened the scoring with a hard shot\nfrom the right Just inside the post,\nwhen all the I.C. defence were expecting him to centre. I.C. drew level\nalmost immediately from a goal by\nHolmes after a goal-mouth scramble,\nbut before half-time U.C. scored two\nmore goals in quick succession. In\nthe second half U.C. rubbed in their\nlead in no uncertain fashion, and\nscored another two goals. One of\nthese was an amazing shot from Newson\nreverse-sti ok, on the run, into the\nroof of the net. It should be said\nthat at no time did I.C. give up the\nstruggle. It Just wasn't our day and\nwe were beaten by a superior team.\nIncidentally this is the first game in\nwhich the 1st, XI has had more than\ntwo goals scored against it. On Jan. 15th. I.C. entertained two\nteams from Beading University. The\n1st. XI lost 2 - 0 , in unfortunate\nei rou meta noes; the coach from the\nUnion being very late, I.C. started\nwithout Jim Carter in goal, and both\nBeading goals were scored before he\narrived. From then on, I.C. had far\nmore of the play, but Just could not\nso ore, although Holmes hit the post\nwith a good shot. The 2nd. team\nbeat Beading 2nd.41.I. C.1st. XI beat Old Creightonlans\n4 - 1 at Harlington on Jan. ISth.\nThe result never seemed in doubt, even\nthough the team did not show quite the\nform they had been showing earlier in\nthe season. It was particularly\npleasing to have the captain, Graham\nKing, back in the team, and on good\nform, after his enforced lay-off; he\nsoo red two goals. The 2nd. XI beat\nOld Creightonlans 4 - 1 , and have\nwon all their three games this term.\nThe 3rd. XI, drew 3 - 3 against the\nClub.\nHookey Club Record:\nPW D1st. XI 20 15 1\n2nd. XI 11 5 2\nSrd.

The 1st. team has suffered\ntwo successive defeats, to St. Mary's College and Southampton University.\nSome readers may be interested to\nlearn that good relationships with\nHook were well maintained at the\nDorohester Arms, on the way down to\nSouthampton. At Southampton, I,C. played much below standard and provided no answer to the home team' \u2022\ncontinuous attacks. I.C. were fin ally defeated 7 - 0 .\nThe 2nd. XI, at Christmas well placed\nin the League, have since lost two\nimportant League games, but improved\nat Southampton to hold the University\n2nd. to a draw.\nThe several defeats mentioned should\nhave provided some lessons to the\nplayers o ono er ned, and it is to be\nhoped that I.C.'a performance in the\ncoming matches will show the reo ent lapses to be only temporary.\nThe third team are still continuing\ntheir successful run, and in spite of\ndropping a point against Woolrlch,\nstill have a contending lead in their\ndivision.\nOn Saturday 25th. Jan., the long unbeaten run of the 4th. XI ended when\nthey were beaten by School of Pharmacy\nby 3 - 2, after a close gene.

Rubgy Football Cup when\nunable to field their full1 st XV,\ndue to injury, last term, it was\nleft to I.C. to fix the date of this\nmatch. The 15th January was decided\nupon. It was for this reason that\nthe match was played in conditions\nwhere a postponement would normally\nhave been made for fog reduced visibility to 15 yards at times, and the\npitch was waterlogged.\nHaving successfully appraised the\nconditions, I.C. decided that it would\nbe suicide to throw the ball around in\nthe backs and so left it to the forwards to slog it out, and it was from\nforward play that I.C.'s two scores\ncame. Right from the start the I.C. pack hammered away at its Westminster\ncounterpart and successfully held\nthe game in the Westminster half,\nonly long touch-kicking on the part\nof the opposing full-back bringing\nthe play into the I.C. half.whilst\nthe ball was reasonably dry, and\nvisibility allowed, the backs had\none or two runs, with Mil ward rna king one excellent break in the centre\nbefore being pulled down. It was,\nhowever, from a scrum infringement\nnear the Westminster posts that I.C. were able to open the scoring, with\na good penalty from He am, who played\nan excellent defensive game at fly-half.\nThe score remained 3 - 0 until half-time.\nARE YOU FIT? Physical fitness is a great asset,\nas a Cross Country Club member\nhas reo ent ly discovered. He had to\nout down his training because of a bad cold, then on visiting the Doctor\nhe was told that he was recovering\nfrom pneumonia. Obviously TOU ea a benefit from keeping fit. In the seo on d half the Westminster\npack decided to rough the game up a bit, but found the I.C. pack more than\nable to deal with their fist io efforts.\nThe I.C. front row, in the persons of\nEvans, Gibbons and Wronksi, played a tremendously powerful game, so much so\nthat their opposite numbers literally\ncracked, and the I.C. pack as a whole\nplayed so well together as to administer\na lesson in forward play to Westminster.\nOur second try was scored by Lanz, then\nfrom a difficult angle, and with the\nposts invisible in the fog, He am only\njust failed with the conversion, and\nafter a further period of forward battle\nthe final whistle went with I.C. the\nwinners by the convincing margin of\n6 points to nil.I.

The Organiser, Kike Barber,\n(Chem.P.G.) would be glad to hear\nfrom anyone - especially Cross Country\nor Athletio Club members - who is\nwilling to help with the work wh i oh is involved.\nThis year the Relay promises to be\nthe largest yet; we are expecting\nabout 45 Universities and Colleges to\nenter teams.\nLast year we had a large \"START &\nFINISH\" banner, which was erected at\nthe start of the Relay course.

VISITS REDHILL TRAFFIC CONTROL When sight members of the society\ncaught the 1.48 p.m. slow train to\nRedhill on Wednesday, the 22nd January,\nthey were luo ky to have a snowy day.\nThis caused certain delays to t raff io and mads the visit more interesting\nthan if everything had been going to\nplan.

The Club successively\ndefeated London Hospital, Westminster\nCollege, and Marjons, and provided the\nfirst man home in the Q.M. C.7 Jr mile\nrace.\nLondon Hospital was defeated on\nWed. 15th January. The Individual\nwinner was J. Collins with A. Brown\nand G. Tilly together third. The\nClub easily beat Westminster on Sat.\n18th with a triple tie for first\nposition between J. Jaeger, K. Wall,\nand A. Brown. The return match with\nMarjons was held over the old university course at Roehampton and a very\nclose struggle resulted in victory for\nI.C. with J. Collins winning, A. Brown\n3rd, and G. Tilly4 th. On Sat. January 25th, I.C. were\nthird in the important Q.M. C.7^ mile\nfixture, which was won by U.C. However\nJohn Collins did magnificently to win,\ndefeating Jackson of Bristol and\nGilligan of U.C. in a time only 1 sec\nmore than J. Evans' 1956 time, in spite of the heavy conditions which\nhave made this course notorious.\nThe team was unlucky when J. Conway\nand R. Landbeck went off course\nwhilst positioned 2nd and 3rd; nevertheless they did well to finish 5th and\n6th respectively.\nThe second team, competing away\nat Romford met strong opposition from\nWoodford, Plessy, and Romford Athletic\nClubs.

It was a day\nof heavy snowstorms in Kent resulting\nin the late running of trains from\nTonbridge, in particular the Margate\nand Brighton to Birkenhead express.\nThe Margate portion was badly delayed\nby snow-drifts and arrived at Redhill\nmore than three hours late. The\nBrighton section was only slightly\nbehind time. As a result a freight\ntrain had to be cancelled to provide\nan engine far the latter part between\nRedhill and Reading as it was sent\nahead of the more badly delayed portion.\nThese hitches,together with more\nminor ones resulting from frozen\npoints,among other causes,made the\nvisit one of exceptional interest. On\na normal day, the average lateness of\npassenger trains at their terminal\npoints is less than half a minutes.\nThis is in a district where the traffic is very heavy all the year round.\nOne late train can delay many others\nbehind it. Another hold-up on this day was\ncaused by a bent conductor rail near\nArundel. This meant that only one\nline could be used between two stations,\ncausing delays of up to half an hour\nto the Victoria-Bognor service.
