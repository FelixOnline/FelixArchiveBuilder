    "content": "ARTS\nFELIX\n22\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAs cold winds start to blow in the typical London\nwinter squalls and chills, many of us will no doubt\nget our moaning caps on and curse the unfriendly\nBritish winter. But, for the determined companions\nof the famous Arctic explorer Captain Scott, depicted in \u201cThe Worst Journey in the World\u201d, such\na trivial winter would have been yearned for. Written by one of the youngest members of the 1912\nexpedition to the Antarctic, Apsley Cherry-Garrard\u2019s\ngripping account records the fateful journey to the\nfrozen deserts of the South Pole. The first-hand account tells the human story behind the famously\ntragic race, as well as \u2018the worst journey\u2019, the equally disastrous scientific mission to collect penguin\neggs in the Antarctic midwinter.\nThe twin missions of Polar exploration and scientific advancement came at a time full of excitement\nfor British ingenuity and exploration, buoying the national mood. Taken up by this excitement, CherryGarrard was eager for adventure, but was not the\narchetypal explorer. Taken on board the mission as\na \u201czoological assistant\u201d, Cherry-Garrard was initially\nthought of as little use, with bad eyesight and only\nmodest experience at just 24. He quickly however\nbecame vital as a member of the core team, forming\nclose bonds with crewmates Captain Scott, \u2018Birdie\u2019\nBowers, Dr Wilson and the famous Titus Oates.\nAlong with Bowers and Wilson, he would undertake the challenge to collect penguin eggs for re-search, and this epic struggle, set in harrowing conditions and beset by bad luck, forms a significant\nportion of the book. Cherry-Garrard describes feats\nof unimaginable endurance; marching across ice,\ndragging sleds by foot, traversing ice-chasms, and\npersistent frostbite and snow blindness, all faced\nwith an earnestness and sincerity that reveals the\nnature of the human spirit when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges.\nThe courage and heroism that characterised this\nbrotherhood is what forms the heart of \u201cThe Worst\nJourney in the World\u201d, and is what lifts it from mere\ntravel account to a masterpiece that reflects on the\nfinest qualities of human endeavour and determina-tion. It also saves the book from melancholy when\nfaced with the fact that, despite the men\u2019s bravery,\nthere was no victorious conclusion. Through \u201cThe\nWorst Journey in the World\u201d, Cherry honoured the\nselfless British spirit he encountered, and, with it\nas a reminder of the possibility of such spirit, regardless of circumstance, we should be grateful\nthat he did.\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nGeorgia Hole chooses a book to put\nthe wintry weather in perspective\nThe Worst\nJourney in\nthe World by Apsley\nCherry-Garrard\nWhat\u2019s your favourite book, and why should we read\nit? If you want to see it in Felix, send 300 to 400\nwords to arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSam Whitcomb\nEvery now and again London will present\nsomething which will not only impress and astonish you, but leave you buzzing for the rest\nof the week! It\u2019s been a long time since this\nhas been the case, and I look back fondly at the\ntime I found out the IMAX was free for Imperial students, and someone told me I could\npair my student rail card to my Oyster. Well yet\nagain London delivers and this time it comes\nin the form of free alcohol, more art galleries\nthan you could shake a stick at, and a fantastic\narray of twee bars (that\u2019s twee not free). What\nI\u2019m talking about is an astonishing, somewhat\nmysterious event which takes place on the first\nThursday of every month at precisely 6.30pm:\nthe simultaneous opening of all the galleries in\nEast London.\nWe chose Redchurch Street as the focus\nof our visit which is just a short walk from\nShoreditch High Street tube station. The walk\nin itself is more than pleasant; passing by are\nthe charming frontages of the local bars, the\nwarm glow from retro chandeliers, and 1960\u2019s\ninteriors. For those who have never strayed out\nof South Kensington, a trip to the Shoreditch/\nBrick Lane area of London will quite literally\ntransport you from the London you know to a\nsomewhere so dissimilar you will need more\nthan a night to digest it all.\nThe galleries themselves were not disap-pointing. Bunched up together on that lone\nstreet were about ten, each one a disorientat-ing step from the other, and each one so distinctly different from the last. That\u2019s what was\nso great about the whole thing; you\u2019ll be in a\nphotography gallery following the fortunes of\nMichael Hess as he explores the \u2018BINGO &\nSOCIAL CLUB\u2019, then step into another world\nof vibrant Dulux painted spirals whilst listening to jazz, hip-hop or house \u2013 the choice was\nactually yours!\nI think it was this which was so fantastic\nabout the whole experience; you were pushed\nand pulled through a series of completely different ideas, squeezed into feeling happy, and\nstretched into re-understanding a fear of cats.\nSome of the exhibitions were weirdly appeal-ing, I mean who would have realised an angelic\nmonkey was actually a stand against animal\ntesting? Or that a school of fish in a sea of red\nsymbolised the desperate problem of overfish-ing, and more interestingly the human/animal\nequality issue?\nWhether you see faces in paint splatters, see\nyour sister in a melting cat, or toads in islands,\nthe experience is totally consuming and I was\nsad when the end came at 9 \u2013 far too early. Oh\nand I didn\u2019t mention the beer. Either go to the\nlarger galleries, or arrive early: confronting the\nweird and wonderful is easier with a complementary glass of white wine in hand.\nLate Night Art runs throughout Shoreditch\nevery first Thursday of the month. www.\nfirstthursdays.co.uk has all the details.\nLeonardo Fine Art and Photo-soc are running an open trip to the next, on Thursday\n2nd Dec. Join them (join their mailing lists\nfor information).\nOver one hundred\ngalleries before 9pm\nShoreditch is the hotbed of all London\u2019s most cutting-edge, original talent and a monthly evening of late night\nopenings promises to let you into its heart\nFriday 19 November 2010\nOh Art, I totally do not understand you at all. But you look pretty, which is fine for me\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX\n10\nScience Editors: James Goldsack\nKatya-yani Vyas\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nUncle Tungsten\nby Oliver Sacks\nAnd a few suggestions...\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s lolcat\nA boa constrictor has given birth without mating. ZZ\nchromosomes produce males and ZW produce fe-males, but these baby snakes have WW. She gave\nbirth through parthenogenesis (half-cloning) when\nthere were four courting males in her enclosure.\nIn this charming biography, Sacks gives a wonderfully vivid account of his earlier years and his fascination with chemistry. Evoking memories of his\nfamily and their fascination with science, he paints\na picture of the environment that fostered his curiosity and inquisitiveness. Sacks proves himself to be a\nbrilliant storyteller; his accounts of boarding school\nand the return to home life where he nurtured his\npassion for science are witty and endearing.\nParticularly poignant are his dry humour and careful comedy, a welcome addition to what is a highly\nemotive biography (apparently moving some readers\nto tears). What is most inspiring is the innocence of\nSack\u2019s early fascination with chemistry; he is now\na highly distinguished neurologist and a respected\nfigure in popular science. This innocence leaves us\nwith a sense of resolve; after all, this brilliant mind\nwas once a child too. Katya-yani Vyas\nThe retrovirus conundrum\nVictoria Bignet\nHow do retroviruses insert their genome into host DNA?\nImperial College researchers from the Department of Infectious Diseases have just succeeded in determining the mechanism of retroviral\nintegration, using x-rays to analyse the key molecular structures involved in this process.\nThe Diamond synchrotron in Oxfordshire\nwas the researchers\u2019 main tool to produce intense X-ray beams enabling them to observe\nmolecular interactions. \u201cThis kind of fundamental research is vital if we are to advance\nour understanding of the viruses and diseases\nthat affect millions of people around the world.\nKnowing the 3D structure of the mechanisms\ninvolved is like being able to see inside the engine of your car. If you can actually see what\nis happening, you get an idea of how you can\nfix it\u201d, says Professor Thomas Sorensen, who\nis Principal Beamline Scientist at the Diamond\nsynchrotron.\nA retrovirus relies on its host-cell machinery to replicate its genome. The latter is in the\nform of RNA, and is converted to DNA once in\nthe host cell. Viral DNA must then be inserted\nwithin host-cell chromosomal DNA. The way\nthis insertion is carried out has, up till now,\nbeen a biological enigma. The Imperial College researchers have managed to describe a\nkey agent in this vital step for the virus: the\nintasome, a nucleoprotein complex composed\nof an integrase tetramer (IT). Integrase is a formerly known enzyme which confines and fuses\nthe ends of viral and host DNA together.\nPrototype foamy virus (PFV) is very similar\nto HIV in its way of integrating its genome.\nWith the synchrotron, the authors analysed\ncrystal structures of host DNA in complex with\nthe intasome of PFV. That is, the 3D structures\nof integrase bound to both viral and host DNA\nin atomic detail. From this observation, the authors elucidated the confinement mechanism\nof target DNA before integration, as well as\nthe intermediary steps of post-catalytic strand\ntransfer. \u201cOnly 18 months ago we had a rather\nsketchy understanding of retroviral integration\u201d, says Dr Peter Cherepanov from the Department of Medicine.\nTwo integrase tetramers (ITs) come together\nto form a narrow cleft, which accommodates\nthe host DNA in a highly bent configuration,\nfacilitating access for IT active sites to the scis-sile phosphodiester bonds. For insertion into\nchromatin, the ITs are thought to interact with\nhost nucleosomal DNA , and/or the histone oc-tamer. Once this is performed, the phosphodi-ester linking viral and host DNA gets ejected\nout of the active site. As expected from knowledge on the relatively low degree of sequence\nselectivity of retroviruses for chromosomal\nDNA, interactions between IT and host DNA\nbases are sparse. Indeed, strong selectivity for\nchromosomal DNA would limit possible integration sites and thus reduce viral fitness. Yet\ntwo sites of close contact were identified.\nIn the context of gene-therapy, Cherepanov\nstresses that: \u201cone of the main problems with\nthe current method is that retroviral integration\nis too random. [...] Ideally, we want to insert\ntherapeutic genes in predefined, safe locations\nof the human genome\u201d. With these findings,\none could theoretically create site-specific\nretroviral vector systems by designing an inte-grase with higher selectivity for a wanted target\nDNA sequence.\nThe synthetic retrovirus could insert a functional copy of a desired gene into a human chromosome by greater certainty of insertion site.\nThis greatly improves the technique\u2019s safety by\nfor instance reducing the risk of activating an\noncogene, thereby avoiding the reoccurrence\nof former cases such as leukaemia in treated\npatients. The discoveries would also help improving existing antiviral strategies, facilitate\nthe design of better drugs to combat AIDS, and\nstimulate novel approaches to blocking viral\nreplication.\nHuge leap in quantum computing\nKelly Oakes\nDo you think you could make sense of this\nsentence if every fourth word was missing?\nHow about trying to hold a conversation when\nyou can only hear three quarters of what the\nother person is saying? Cutting out a fraction\nof the information being transferred in a given\nsituation may make life slightly difficult, but it\ncertainly doesn\u2019t stop the meaning being conveyed in most cases. This is because of the redundancy built into language. However, redundancy is not only useful for conversations on a\ndodgy phone line - it can also come in handy\nin the world of quantum computing, as two\nresearchers explained in a paper published in\nPhysical Review Letters last week.\nThe research was carried out by Sean Barrett,\nof Imperial College, and Thomas Stace, at the\nUniversity of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. They found that if a quarter of the qubits\n(the quantum equivalent of bits, which store information in a classical computer) are lost, the\ncomputer can still function as normal. Barrett\nand Stace looked at the remaining information\nand used a code that could check for errors to\ndecipher what was missing. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising,\nbecause you wouldn\u2019t expect that if you lost\na quarter of the beads from an abacus that it\nwould still be useful,\u201d said Dr Barrett.\nOne of the main differences between a classical bit and its quantum equivalent is that the\nFriday 19 November 2010\nFantastic phenomenon from the\nNatural World\nlatter can exhibit entanglement. This means\nthat, no matter how far away two entangled\nqubits are, if one changes so will the other - in-stantaneously. Quantum computers take advantage of this effect, as well as another property\nof quantum systems known as superposition,\nto perform complicated calculations much\nfaster than classical computers. At the moment,\nthough, the largest quantum computers have\nonly two or three qubits.\nIt had previously been thought that large\nquantum computers would be very sensitive to\nmissing information, but this research shows\nthat they should be much more robust than\nwe\u2019d imagined. At this stage, the work is theoretical and scientists must do a lot more in order\nto make quantum computers bigger than a few\nqubits in the lab.\nWhen large quantum computers are a reality,\nthey may have the potential to revolutionise\nfields as far apart as drug modelling, electronics and code breaking. However, we won\u2019t\nknow exactly what applications quantum computers will be best suited to until we\u2019re able to\nmake one.\n\u201cAt the moment quantum computers are good\nat particular tasks, but we have no idea what\nthese systems could be used for in the future,\u201d\nsaid Dr Barrett. \u201cThey may not necessarily be\nbetter for everything, but we just don\u2019t know.\nThey may be better for very specific things that\nwe find impossible now.\u201d\nSee? The future isn\u2019t \u2018orange\u2019 at all! Idiots... It\u2019s quite obviously blue and whooshy\n\n"

We had sped along\nthe recently burst banks of the Yamuna river\nand looking out across the dark red and green\nlandscape, barely illuminated by the metallic grey sky, we didn\u2019t think twice about the\nroad ahead. With a mere 100km by jeep left,\nthat we would cover in 6-7 hours, we realised\nwe had underestimated the destructive power\nof the monsoon rains. The \u2018road\u2019 we were to\nfollow to the road head didn\u2019t live up to its\nname. We found it was blocked in sections,\nby vast landslides of shale, saturated mud and\ntruck-sized boulders, or in the worst cases,\nreduced to a single precarious strip of earth,\nthe remnants of the highway strewn across\nthe slopes below. Three days later we finally\nmade it through, and now we were sat, hiding\nfrom the rain, next to a wooden hut, playing\neye spy, waiting to meet our in-country team.\nSilently hoping that the overall situation was\nabout to improve, it finally did. Norbu and\nDarwa had arrived, along with the rest of our\n9-strong base camp team. A series of clipped\ncommands from these two hardy Sherpas and\nhalf a ton of base camp supplies were unload-ed, tents erected and chai served.\nThree days of trekking later and we were\nsettling into our base camp, located beside a\nmeander in the glacial torrent of the Obra Gad\n(river). At just under 4,000m (13,000 ft) we\ncould feel the effects of altitude, although low\nclouds had so far prevented us from getting\na good look at our climbing objectives. A reconnaissance was needed and so we left camp\nto explore the valley floor and the access to a\nhigh glacier, which we believed would enable\naccess to the valley\u2019s highest peak \u2013 Dauru, at\n5,877m. After exploring a rocky spur and establishing a gear cache we left all but the essentials and returned to base to prepare a multi-day outing. Unsure of conditions higher up we\npacked loads to deal with any eventuality and\nonce again headed up the valley. Carrying a\nload up to 4,900m we made a second cache in\nwhat we considered to be a good campsite at\nthe edge of a glacier, a safe distance from crevasses and avalanche prone slopes. To aid ac-climatisation, we descended for a final night of\nsleep in the valley before moving our tents up\nto our high camp, rising early the next morning to make the first ascent of Peak 5,480m at\nthe back of this hanging valley. The going was\ndifficult in soft, fresh snow, mixed with the occasional rocky step but we were rewarded with\nour first peak of the trip and a fantastic view of\nthe potential route up Dauru \u2013 it looked entirely\nachievable!\nAfter a second night up high we returned to\nbase to spend a rest day bouldering and reconnoitering an approach to another mountain of\ninterest \u2013 Ranglana, 5,554m. With a resupply of food we made a push up to, and past,\nour previous high camp and pitched tents at\n5,175m, close to the valley headwall. An early\nstart the next morning and some cold climbing up the headwall gained a narrow col that\nwould give access to the upper slopes of Dauru.\nAfter a close call with a collapsing cornice (a\nwind-sculpted, overhanging edge of snow) we\ndecided that following the ridge directly to the\nsummit would be rather dangerous, and instead\nmade an ascending traverse of the mountain\u2019s\nNorth West flank. Reaching the 5,877m summit under clear skies we were afforded spectacular views across not only the Obra Valley, but\nof hundreds of snowcapped peaks (many still\nunclimbed) to the North, South, East and West.\nAfter many panoramic and group photographs\nwere taken we began the 2,000m (vertical) descent to base, pausing to clear our camp, returning just after nightfall to enjoy yet another\nexcellent meal.\nBy this point in the expedition our thoughts\nwere turning to the journey back out - our latest\nupdate revealed that since our arrival, conditions had worsened in the proximity of Jakhol\nand we would need to allow extra time on the\nwalk out. The consequence, fewer remaining\nclimbing days than we had hoped, and one\nmajor objective still unattempted: The majestic Ranglana. We knew the peak had been attempted at least twice previously and on visual\ninspection its northern aspect of steep face and\ncomplex ridges appeared to be a major mountaineering challenge. After studying the map\nof the area we believed the key to a rapid ascent was in accessing a col at the base of the\nmountain\u2019s West ridge. Leaving base camp in\nthe afternoon we approached the mountain and\nestablished a camp below this col (4,800m).\nWith the end of the day fast approaching, Andy\nand Phil ascended to the col and immediately\nrealised that the West ridge, although appearing\nclimbable, would require more time than we\ncould possibly commit. Disappointment? No,\nby descending from this point we could gain\nthe South face and from there follow a ridge-line directly to the summit! Another early start\nand we were on our way to the opposite side of\nthe mountain; baked by the sun we made slow\nprogress until gaining the ridge, and a breeze.\nSome steep snow slopes led to a few rocky\nsteps as we neared the narrow summit. After\nsome attempts we eventually found the line of\nweakness to the summit and Jonny led up to\nthe top across snow covered slabs, completing our Obra Valley hat-trick. With some light\nclouds building we took the obligatory photos\nand began a largely uneventful descent back\nto our camp. Uneventful, except of course for\nPhil managing to step into a deep hole filled\nwith powder snow. The consistency and effect was similar to quicksand and so a quick\ndigging operation was required to free him. A\nfinal night was spent in our cold mountain tents\nbefore we could descend back to the warmth\nof base camp and prepare for our withdrawal\nfrom the valley.\nOur retreat from the Himalaya was, thank-fully, much more straightforward than our ap-proach. With the assistance of about 15 porters\nwe carried the gear out on foot for two days\nbefore once again meeting our jeep, and on\nthe third day were able to make Dehra Dun. A\nday was spent sampling local fruit and greasy\ntreats, followed by a sleeper train to Delhi, giving us a full day to enjoy the track cycling and\nathletics at the Commonwealth Games.\nThe Imperial College Obra Valley Expedition consisted of Boris Korzh, Philip Leadbeater, Kunal Masania, Andrew McLellan\nand Jonathan Phillips and was supported\nby the Imperial College Exploration Board,\nMount Everest Foundation, British Mountaineering Council, Welsh Sports Association, Lyon Equipment Award, SIS (Science\nin Sport) Ltd, PHD.

The\ntournament report follows:\nOn Sunday 7th November we had\n9 keen dodgeballers meet early in the\nmorning in Waterloo station. We\u2019d\nfound out that 3 of the guys from the\nsecond team had dropped out for various reasons so it was not a great start to\nthe day!\nWe managed to get our tickets to Sholing train station and boarded the train,\nalthough Ben \u201cI\u2019ll happily miss the train\nfor a BK bacon double cheeseburger\u201d\nBell managed to cut it so fine that even\nAdam \u201cI never panic. I\u2019m the president.\u201d\nCutmore went a little pale.\nAfter a couple of train changes and\na \u201cshort\u201d walk from the station to the\nleisure centre, we finally arrived. We\nwere running a little late as Imperial were playing the first game of the\ntournament. After getting changed and\nquickly warming up, it was straight into\nthe action!\nThe way tournament matches work is\nthat you have five 2 minutes games and\nthe team to have won the most out of\nthat 5, wins the match.\nThe 1sts had their opening match\nagainst the best team in their group, the\nDerby Seahawks 1sts. After the first two\ngames, we were level at 1-1. This was\ndue to some brilliant throwing by Steve\n\u201cI\u2019m not too bad at running\u201d Ndumbe\nand about 37 catches by Alan \u201cCareful,\nor I\u2019ll drop you\u201d Soltani. After this, they\nAdam Cutmore changed their tactics and, catching us off\nguard, went on to win 4-1.\nFortunately, Imperial I then went on\nto win their next two matches 5-0 (So-ton Dodgettes) and 3-2 (Portsmouth\nB) with brilliant team play all round.\n(We\u2019re not going to mention that one of\nthose matches was against Southampton\nwomen\u2019s team... Ben Bell summed it\nup: \u201cEither they\u2019re all gonna be absolute dykes or amazing at Dodgeball. Or\nboth!\u201d).\nUnfortunately, they were neither.\nHence, the first team qualified second in\ntheir group and went on through to the\nquarters.\nDuring all this, dark horses Imperial\nII, plus some borrowed players from\nthe Derby 3rds, were steaming through\ntheir group as well. With Tom \u201cI refuse\nto catch anything\u201d Lowndes captaining\nthe team, Dan \u201cSuicide\u201d Price getting\nsomeone out with virtually every throw\nand Scott \u201cI\u2019m a goalie, therefore I can\ncatch\u201d Edwards catching, they managed\nto win matches against the Soton Pirates\n2nds and Winchester Reloaded, at times\nwith only 4/6 players on the team! Their\nthird match was against the reigning national champions, Jammy Dodgers, who\nhappen to have two England players in\ntheir team. Despite some of our 1st team\nstepping in to help out, we were demolished as expected.\nStill, the 2nds had qualified for the\nquarters as well and everyone was in\ngreat spirits!\nThe II\u2019s had their quarter final first.\nThey were up against the Southampton 1sts, whom were obviously in their\nhome ground. We borrowed players\nfrom Derby 3rds but could not overcome their experience and strength. We\ntook solace in the fact that the Soton 1sts\nwent on to be runners up of the whole\ntournament. The II\u2019s had fought a good\nfight.\nThe I\u2019s had their quarter final against\nMinotaur Dodgeball. Their captain \u201cthe\nworld hates me, so I\u2019m gonna moan\nabout every decision, even after I\u2019ve\nwon the game\u201d was their only decent\nplayer and we were looking for a result.\nWith some blistering throws from Rupert \u201cThese ****** balls are so ******\n****\u201d.\nSome brilliant catches from Adam\n\u201cThrow together, Dodge alone\u201d Cutmore saw us go 2-0 up. Unfortunately,\na change in mentality from the Minotaurs led to them edging the next two\ngames.\nThis left for a very tense final game.\nIn the last 10 seconds both teams were\ndown to two players each and the Minotaurs had all 3 balls. They threw one.\nAdam went for a heroic catch to wrap it\nup...and dropped.\nEveryone was gutted and felt very\nhard done by. We had definitely been\nthe better team and received nothing\nbut praise from the Derby 1sts who\nwould have been our semi-final oppo-nents.\nAt the end of the day it was a great\nperformance by all involved and we\nare looking forward to the University\nChampionships at Warwick University\non November 28th and a friendly against\nRoyal Holloway University pencilled in\nfor November 24th.\nAnd never, ever forget the words\nwhich will be forever imortalised\nby the legend of dodgeball, Patches O\u2019Houlihan; \u2018If you can dodge a\nwrench...\u2019\n\n"

Looks\nare an easy way to\ngauge the physiological and genetic\nstature of a potential mate (someone\nwith one non-functional eye and no legs\nprobably won\u2019t be any good at fending\noff savage beasts), and so evolution has\ndesigned human beings to judge other\nmembers of the species largely on their\nappearance. We all do it, however vehemently some of us might try to deny\nit. Why else would our favourite magazines be filled with advice from the arcane and mysterious world of fashion\nabout what to wear and, much more im-portantly, what not to wear?\nThousands of products designed specifically to mask the hideous blemishes\nand other imperfections that afflict us\nlitter the shelves of almost any pharmacy you could name. We strive endlessly\nto improve our appearance because we\nknow how important it is, with wonderful television shows like Extreme Makeover actively encouraging us to hack\nour repulsive faces apart in the name of\nbeauty.\nBlack Sheep\nFor both the less aesthetically pleasing\nmembers of the public and those semi-humans so unbearably hideous that they\nrefrain from most social interaction\n(among whom I sorrowfully count my-self), this almost universal preoccupation with the cool and sexy is fairly dis-piriting. Shows like Entourage do their\nlevel best to make you feel suicidally inadequate unless you happen to be a gorgeous billionaire actor, while the mere\nsight of the buxom beauties in Desperate Housewives sends most women into\na mad frenzy of jealousy.\nNew toothpastes, moisturisers, and\nhair products are marketed to the down-trodden, unsightly masses, and those\nmasses, motivated by sheer self-loath-ing, buy them in enormous numbers. We\ntry so insanely hard to make ourselves\nlook presentable that, paradoxically,\nmost of our efforts simply exacerbate\nthe problem, fueling an extremely powerful low self-esteem engine.\nDespite some minor successes in\nmodifying ourselves, we remain largely\nthe same, and, unfortunately, so does the\nimportance of our appearance. What a\nconundrum! What on earth is there to\ndo? Are you destined to become as un-healthily bitter and angry as it is becoming increasingly obvious I am? Well, as\nan unattractive individual myself, I find\nit productive and moderately therapeutic\nto channel my resentment and rage into\nsmall, barely read columns in university\nnewspapers. This somewhat alleviates\nthe crushing misery of my virtually intolerable existence. I jest, of course (but,\ndepressingly, only very slightly).\nThe search for a happy middle ground\nis the goal as far as this issue is con-cerned. The opinions of other people\n(be they respected friends or anonymous\nsimpletons) are rarely worth ignoring\nentirely or taking so seriously that they\nsend you into a spiraling depression.\nAppearance is important, and people do\nmake judgements based on it, but take\nsolace in the fact that different people\noften appreciate different looks, one of\nwhich may be yours (sadly for me, the\nscruffy, gangly student look isn\u2019t currently in vogue). There is much, much\nmore to you, and everyone else, than\nyour appearance, and if you\u2019re still\nnot convinced, there\u2019s always Extreme\nMakeover.\nI\nwas back home the other day,\nclearing out the attic, where, in-explicably, a great deal of my\ndearest childhood possessions\nhad wound up; cherished dolls,\nknitted by a late grandmother; industrious railway tracks by Brio and Tomy;\nand enough Lego to fill a skip. I was\nconflicted. On the one hand, relieved;\nmy parents had said they had all been\nstolen one night by goblins. On the other\nhand, betrayed; my parents had lied to\nme. And if they lied to me about this,\nwhat other pillars of my reality are built\non quicksand. Father Christmas? The\nTooth Fairy? Say it ain\u2019t so!\nBut parental deceit aside, I also came\nacross a set of photographs I had at\nSixth Form. Proper photography; with\ndarkrooms, heady chemical fugs, and\nbearded men swearing at size zero su-permodels. As I drifted from print to\nprint \u2013 out of focus, blurry and overexposed \u2013 I came to realise something. I\nlove photography.\nDespite centuries of bizarrely bedecked fellows in pulpits assuring them\nthat there is an afterlife of an eternal\npersuasion, men have sought immortality \u2013 usually vicariously through great\nworks. The Pyramids at Giza, defeating the French (at anything) or even A\nClockwork Orange. The gist of this be-Rhys Davies\ning that if someone remembers you, then\nin some way, you\u2019ll still be alive. Admittedly, not in the way that really counts,\nbut it\u2019s something.\nAnd that\u2019s what I like about photog-raphy. Photos are a window into our\npast. And it\u2019s not just the great and the\ngrand. You can look back in your family\nalbums, smile at relatives long-dead and\nrecall their adventures and anecdotes.\nPhotography has offered immortality to\nthe common man in far greater numbers\nthan any religious leader.\nBut there is a twist to this, a hellfire to\nthis eternity. Photos, especially now, in\nthe days of digital and disposable cam-eras, have become...repetitive. Open any\npacket of holiday snaps and I guarantee\nthat the majority of photos will be of\nfamilies smiling in front of each and\nevery minor landmark, with the occasional mother reclining on a sun-bed in\nthe shade.\nExhibit B, Facebook, that testament to\nour age. Select an album at a random and\nhave a quick e-flick through. You will\nsee a group of friends, with some variations and substitutions, in a club, bar, or\nparty somewhere, smiling, cheering, and\ngenerally indicating how they\u2019re having\na grand old time. Now, go to the next\nalbum. See anything different?\nI\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t record\nthe good times. But when our grandchil-dren, or scouts from an alien race (Or\nboth), go through these documents of\nour existence, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll reach the\nconclusion that we lived in a permanent\nstate of bliss and that the Eiffel Tower is\nonly a measuring rule for getting a photo\nstraight. It\u2019s repetitive, it\u2019s monotonous,\nit\u2019s boring. Of course we should remember times when we were happy, but we\nshould also recall when we were sad or\nangry, when we were lonely and sick,\nto complement and contrast. Only then\ncan we remember ourselves and be remembered as people, living, breathing\nhumans \u2013 not some horrible all-smiling\nmonstrosity from a Batman serial.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that photos should\nbe our biographies. And unlike written\nbiographies, they\u2019re notoriously easy to\nmake. All we have to do is live \u2013 something I find comes naturally to most peo-ple. The man with the camera will do the\nrest.\nThey\u2019re also more powerful. They say\na picture says a thousand words, and I\nthink they\u2019re right. Do you really need\nwords when you see photographs of the\nTwin Towers or 7/7? Or how about when\nthe Berlin Wall came down? Or that one\nwith Einstein sticking his tongue out?\nAnd with that, there\u2019s nothing left for\nme to say but \u2013 CHEESE!\nPhotos can make us immortal\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is\nthat photos should\nbe our biographies.\nAnd unlike written\nones, they\u2019re easy to\nmake.\u201d\n\u201cEvolution has\ndesigned human\nbeings to judge\nothers largely on\ntheir appearance\u201d\nThanks to the NUS\nrioters, we all look\nlike morons\nWe all judge people on looks\nAs a general principle I hate\nprotests. I would happily bet\nyou my life savings, the savings\nof my future children, and the\neternal souls of all of my ancestors that in a large enough\nsample of protestors, 50%\nhaven\u2019t got a fucking clue what\nthey are protesting about.\nThat is not to say that you\ncan\u2019t have intelligent protests.\nThe Science Is Vital protests\noutside Westminster in early\nOctober were intelligent, well-organised, and above all, real-istic. If protests were cars they\nwould definitely be of German\nmake.\nExtending the metaphor, the\nrecent NUS protest would be\nthe rusty old banger you buy\nfrom a man called Joe who\nperpetually squints at you,\nwhen your financial situation\nhas gone through rock bottom and is plummeting toward\nshit creek. This isn\u2019t because\nI fundamentally disagree with\nwhat the protests were about,\nthough for the record, I do. It is\nbecause I thought that as the\n\u2018academically elite\u2019, we could\ncome up with better placards\nthan \u2018Fuck Fees\u2019, and not resort to violence.\nIt is true that the rioters were\na small minority. But that\u2019s not\nthe point. The general public\nwill only remember thuggish\nstudents pictured smashing\nwindows and being morons in\ngeneral.\nThe NUS could have asked\nthe students to withdraw from\nthe Millbank building, to distance themselves from the\nextremists. Or you know, actually have adequate numbers of\norganisers to prevent this sort\nof situation.\nWe are all going to be tarred\nwith the same brush by the\npublic. The NUS march hasn\u2019t\nshown \u2018unity\u2019, or that students\nare \u2018serious about the issue of\nthe cap\u2019, but that a number of\nstudents are inarticulate, thuggish brutes. No doubt any day\nsoon the headline \u2018Students\nCause Cancer\u2019 will be an exclusive in the Daily Mail, and\nold ladies will complain to local\nradio stations about how \u2018students are dragging this country\ndown\u2019.\nIan Wei\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 15\ns on the extent of free speech?\nFriday 19 November 2010\nA Muslim perspective from Yasser Mahmoud\nThe Universal Declaration of Human\nRights says, \u201cEveryone has the right to\nfreedom of opinion and expression; this\nright includes freedom to hold opinions\nwithout interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas\nthrough any media regardless of frontiers.\u201d\nCutting through the jargon, most people understand that freedom of speech\nis the right to say what you want. The\nwording is often a source for disagreement but the notion in itself is laced\nwith hypocrisy; the way we conduct our\nlives, interact with others and raise our\nchildren is not in line with this. Children are taught that if they cannot say\nanything nice then not to say anything\nat all. In our interactions at work and\nour social lives we do not \u201cfreely\u201d express ourselves- our speech is limited\nby common courtesy and if we hold a\nbitter thought about our supervisor or\nco-worker we keep that to ourselves for\nthe fear of losing our jobs or upsetting\nour peers. Some may say you are still\nfree to say these things, when in effect\nyour freedom is limited by the fabric of\nthe society in which you live and so this\nidea of truly free speech is alien to us.\nSome may argue it should be a fundamental right that if we find an ideology,\nAs a student it is important to me to express my opinions and stand up for what\nI believe in, but with Judaism playing\na central role in my life what limitations does this make on my freedom of\nspeech, or is it a right?\nIn Judaism there is the principle of\nLashon Harah, negative speech, which\nis the principle of not speaking negative\ncomments about a person even if they\nare true. This is sourced from \u201cYou shall\nnot be a gossiper among the people\u201d.\nThis would generally encompass bitchy\ncomments, or gossip magazines which\ncause hurt to the celebrity.\nA Chasidic tale vividly illustrates the\ndanger of improper speech: A man went\nabout the community telling malicious\nlies about the rabbi. Later, he realized\nthe wrong he had done, and began to\nfeel remorse. He went to the rabbi and\nbegged his forgiveness, saying he would\ndo anything he could to make amends.\nThe rabbi told the man, \u201cTake a feather\nA Jewish\nperspective from\nCharlotte Levene\nion and holding decision makers to account is crucial to democratic function.\nConstant electorate feedback should\nform the basis of a responsible government\u2019s mandate.\nThe freedom of speech prevents the\nbuild-up of discontent in the society by\nallowing one to vent his grievances. Unvented struggles are prone to escalation\nand thus lead to the breakdown of so-ciety. Regimes that allow little freedom\nof speech are akin to a pressure cooker,\nbuilding up pressure until the destined\nviolent explosion.\nHistory shows us what freedom of\nspeech has awarded us. The abolition of\nslavery, universal suffrage and other humanitarian achievements were not gifts\nfrom above, but struggles from below.\nFreedom of speech allowed these pioneering social leaders to effect change\nand spread their message of revolution\nto their fellow citizens.\nIn the religious setting, freedom of\nspeech in our society is especially lim-ited. Many religious dogmas and practices are taboo subjects for believers as\nwell as others. Children or new converts\nare encouraged to accept things without\nquestion. If God says the Amalekites\nneed to be exterminated whereas the\nIsraelis are His \u201cchosen people\u201d, that\nis just the way it is. Douglas Adams\nquestioned at great length why \u201ccertain\nissues...we\u2019ve decided are holy, above\nquestioning\u201d unlike for say sports controversies or economic policies. We are\nespecially \u201ctolerant\u201d to religion. We\ntreat the criticism of religious practice as\n\u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d. However, our society\u2019s implied restriction of freedom of\nspeech to religious issues had incurred a\nSpeakers Corner in Hyde Park gives people a platform for their opinions\nhuge toll. Recent incidents of Catholic\npriests molesting children are prime examples of how silence and inaction create problems. Victims, overwhelmed by\nthe idea that priests are absolutely holy\nand that the Church has unquestionable\nauthority, were afraid to come forward\nto exercise their freedom of speech and\ntestify against their faith. That reluctance allowed perpetrators to remain at\nlarge and harm more individuals.\nHow about radical and hate speech\nmade by religious groups? Take the restriction of extremist preaching in the\ninterest of national security because\nof the hatred and anti-governmental\nfeeling it incites. Terrorist attacks are\nabominable. However, restricting the\nfreedom of speech meant that the requests of extremists are unheard and\ndiscounted by the society. That would\nlead to more discontent in extremists\ngroups and drive them to be even more\nextreme. Moreover, extremist organisations recruit members often by invoking\nthe restriction of their freedom of speech\nby the government and convince potential supporters that they are the victims\nand should be sympathised. By letting\nextremists air their views and rebut them\noutright in public, we can extinguish\ntheir major propaganda tool and show\npotential members of extremist organisation we are on the right side.\nNoam Chomsky famously said, \u201cIf\nyou believe in freedom of speech, you\nbelieve in freedom of speech for views\nyou don\u2019t like. Goebbels was in favour\nof views he liked. So was Stalin\u201d. We, as\ncitizens of a democratic nation, should\nstrive to remove all barriers to the freedom of speech.\npillow, cut it open, and scatter the feathers to the winds.\u201d The man thought\nthis was a strange request, but it was a\nsimple enough task, and he did it gladly.\nWhen he returned to tell the rabbi that\nhe had done it, the rabbi said, \u201cNow, go\nand gather ALL the feathers\u201d. The man\nprotested, \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible.\u201d \u201cOf\ncourse it is\u201d replied the Rabbi, \u201calthough\nyou may regret the evil you have done\nand truly desire to correct it, it is as impossible to repair the damage done by\nyour words as it is to collect everyone of\nthese feathers\u201d. This shows how careful\nyou have to be when speaking; a hurtful word may spread and not be able to\nbe recovered, as you never know who it\nmight reach. Lashan Harah isn\u2019t saying\nthat one can\u2019t voice an opinion, but not\na personal attack and respect for others\nmust be kept.\nJudaism also has a strong principle of\nlove your neighbour as yourself. One\ncan express one\u2019s opinions but why\nwould one want to hurt people\u2019s feelings\nor incite hate? This is one of the main\nproblems that are brought on by Freedom of Speech today.\nThe Talmud is the basis of Jewish\nLaw, however it also contains all the\narguments and thought processes that\ncaused the Sages to come to their deci-sions. The Sages often had completely\ndiffering opinions. The fact that all these\narguments are recorded shows how valuable the process of arguing and standing\nup for your beliefs are in Judaism. G-d\ngave the responsibility to man to choose\nthe law via a process of democracy \u2013 a\nmajority decision.\nHowever, even through all the argu-ing, one must have great respect for\ntheir \u2018rival\u2019. Two of the greatest rivals\nwho had differing views on everything\nallowed their children to marry in the\nend, being at peace with each other.\nSo, what has this shown me about my\nrole as a Jewish Student, am I allowed\nto stand with placards at a rally? If\nwe didn\u2019t live in a place with differing\nopinions, society would be quite boring!\nThere are different ways of publicizing\nmy views: I can cause hate and single\npeople out, or I can be composed and\ntreat people with respect. The Talmud\nshows that that standing up for beliefs is\nvery important, and as a student I have\ngreat power to make a change in society\n\u2013 and I should take it.\nJudaism gives me the tools of how to\nspeak. It is not freedom of speech - it is\nresponsibility of speech.\nstate or person that we have genuine\ndisagreement with we should be free to\nexpress our beliefs. This freedom to criticise is very important; the prophet Mohammed (pbuh) practiced this right with\nidol worshippers. It was a fundamental\npart of Islam to be able to critique that\nwhich you believed to be wrong, even if\nthe view was held by the vast majority\nof society.\nThis freedom to criticise constructively was very important, yet alongside\nthis there was a very careful line drawn\nin the Quran (surah 16, 125) \u201ccall to\nthe way of your Lord with wisdom and\nbeautiful preaching.\u201d Although there\nwas complete disagreement on fundamental issues between the early Muslims and their countrymen they did not\ntransgress beyond the bounds of good\nmanners. One of the sayings of the\nprophet (pbuh) was \u201cwhomsoever believes in God and the day of Judgement\nshould say good or stay quiet.\u201d The idea\nof freedom of speech being absolute and\nwithout bounds does not agree with Islamic tradition. Furthermore in Islam\nthere is a large weight given to what an\nindividual says as well as what he does,\nnot an arbitrary line drawn between actions and words where you can say what\nyou want to me but not physically hurt\nme. The prophet (pbuh) said \u201cA slave\nof God may utter a word without giving it much importance and because of it\nhe will be raised degrees of reward, and\nhe may utter a word carelessly which\ndispleases God without thinking of its\ngravity and because of it be thrown into\nHell.\u201d\nSo what is the solution? Disagreements stem mainly from interpretation\nof meanings; one individual may believe\nhe has a particular right and another may\ndisagree on what that right entails. As\nlong as there is no consensus on definition of freedom of speech, we cannot\nmove forward. When this definition is\nset, it must be protected by law so individuals that practice it are not subject\nto attack and those who go beyond it are\nheld accountable. In a fair society, double standards cannot continue; we invite\nBelgian M.P. Gurt Wilders to visit the\nHouse of Lords and show his film Fitna,\nyet ban another foreign national, Zakir\nNaik, from even entering the country.\nWe cannot use the excuse that we are at\nwar or under threat from terrorists- we\nhave to stand for justice for all. But principles of freedom of expression must\nalso be in line with the values we live by\nand individuals must not be allowed to\nchange that. Only then can we succeed.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 23\nARTS\nThe Notting Hill fabrication\nWhat do you do when your erotic obsession with your teenage son drives you to self-destruction? Let\u2019s see\nFABRICATION (AFFABULAZIONE),\nuntil 4th Decmber at The Print\nRoom, Notting Hill, \u00a312/\u00a316\nOften I find myself wondering why I\ndon\u2019t lead the life of a Felliniesque,\ncare-free socialite, generally whilst\ncarving the fossilized Crunchy Nut from\nmy cereal bowl or in those few moments\nwhen confronted by the awful reality of\ncapacitance problems. And whilst normally I painfully realize I have neither\nan Italian passport nor a bottomless supply of wealth nor a wardrobe full of dapper suits and accessories, Affabulazione\nindulged me with a glimpse of a dolce-er\nvita, served with a very Italian warning\nof such a life\u2019s pitfalls.\nThe play charts the downfall of a\nMilanese industrialist who destroys his\nwealth, respect and relationships as he\nis plagued by a debilitating sexual desire for his adolescent son. Driven to\nvindicative, devious sex with his wife\nand infantilisation of his son, we see the\nFather, played with gravitas by Jasper\nBritton, become ever more determined\nto reconcile his emotions with his off-spring. Catalysed by a visit from the\nghost of Sophocles during a fever, the\nenigma of his love is equivocally solved\nand spirals deeper into madness crippled\nby his jealous obsession.\nAffabulazione offers a strange mixture of tragedy, parody and sexual\npsychoanalysis, all dressed in a distinctively Italian glamour. The obligatory\nItalian-man-in-crisis-conversationwith-priest scene is given a perverse\ntwist, as we see the dirty Father distracted from the Holy Father as his son\nwalks back up through the garden of his\nLombardy summerhouse (the setting of\nmost of the play, commendably simulated in Notting Hill through the use\nof a cicada recording and turning the\nheaters up). Depravity is maintained\nthroughout, but nothing is trivialized.\nEven through the slightly bizarre climactic scene, the play retains a sense of\ngravity and the perverse desires of the\n\u2018Father\u2019 are never debased.\nThat said, the fact that it was at one\ntime adapted for an opera says a lot\nabout Affabulazione, big on emotion,\nWill Prince not so on plot. Whilst there is a narrative\nto the piece, the decay of the Father\u2019s\nsanity is somewhat clunky and consists\nmore a series of emotional crescendi,\nmeaning it is often more enjoyable to\njust bathe in the bouts of catharsis than\nto track the unraveling of the Father\u2019s\nmorals and mind.\nThe role of the \u2018Mother\u2019 is arguably\nunderplayed by Geraldine Alexander,\nwho it never seemed had quite grasped\nthe magnitude of her predicament, and\nMax Bennett, as the son, strikes a believable balance between young adult\nstallion and subservient teenage son, a\nsense of immaturity perhaps springing\nfrom the actor\u2019s own slightly undeveloped acting technique. Written by Pier\nPaolo Pasolini, a man whose exploits\nare so broad, that one would think had\nhe been alive a little longer, he may\nhave been the first Italian on the Moon,\nthe play is naturally going to be based\n\u201ca strange mixture\nof tragedy, parody\nand sexual\npsychoanalysis,\nall dressed in a\ndistinctively Italian\nglamour\u201d\naround extraordinary experiences, but\nAffabulazione tends at times to wander\noutside the realms of the believable.\nThe intimate nature of the new venue\n(basically a converted garage) makes the\nplay one of the most intense of recent\nmonths and the set, although minimal-ist, supports the actors whilst allowing\nthe fluency needed by such a fantastical\nplay.\nDue to the extremity of the situation,\nI question how much the standard the-atregoer can take from the piece in way\nof a moral, but Affabulazione\u2019s delicate\nstructuring of a man\u2019s desires consuming him makes for a high-tempo, enthralling spectacle. Not to mention the\nfact that it\u2019s cheaper than a weekend\nbreak in Pisa.\nFriday 19 November 2010\n\n"

It was also revealed that Alexander had not believed\nthat a coalition government with the\nConservative Party would have been\npossible, citing that it would be \"ex-tremely difficult to form without splitting [the Liberal Democrats].\"\nThe Liberal Democrats have stood by\ntheir decisions, with a spokesman claiming in response that they have fulfilled\nthe \"four key priorities which were set\nout on the front page of [their] mani-festo\", distinctly laid out as follows:\n'fair taxes that put money back in your\npocket', 'a fair chance for every child',\n'a fair future, creating jobs by making\nBritain greener' and 'a fair deal for you\nfrom politicians'.\nStudent organizations are likely to\ndisagree with the 'fair deal' aspect of\nthe manifesto, with various anti-Liberal\nDemocrat protests being organized next\nweek. The Education Activist Network\ncalls on its followers to 'target Lib Dems\nafter [their] new betrayal', planning a\n'day of mass walkouts to converge on a\ndemonstration outside the Lib Dem HQ'.\nThe NUS has planned a more physically\nrestrained approach, forming their own\n'Right to Recall' pledge for students\nto sign promising that they will vote\nagainst any candidate who broke any\npledge on university fees or Education\nMaintenance Allowances.\nThe initiative is named after a procedure suggested by the Liberal Democrats themselves, involving penalizing\nMPs who break promises or are found\nguilty of impropriety by forcing an immediate by-election.\nFurther blow to Liberal\nDemocrats\u2019 credibility\nN.U.S. threaten \u2018Right to Recall\u2019 as revelations\nquestion sincerity of Lib Dem pre-election pledge\nMatt Colvin\nA\nround 70 students from\nthe University of Manchester and over 170\nfrom the University of\nSussex have staged sit-ins and occupied university buildings in\norder to protest that government\u2019s near\n80% cut to teaching budgets.\nStudents at Manchester university occupied an \u2018admin\u2019 building on the 11th\nof November, the day after the N.U.S.\nmarch in London.

The day for mourning was earmarked for the battle between two past\ngreats; it was time for the annual C&G\nvs. RSM grudge match. A gloomy start\nsaw both teams arrive an hour after the\nscheduled kick-off time due to the ever\nreliable London Transport Network.\nAfter a quick jog from both teams\nand some imaginative lineout calls being thought of the game kicked-off. The\nengineers quickly took advantage of the\nRSM\u2019s lack of pace and Sasha Maitala\nscored his first of two tries punching\nthrough the gaps left by the props in the\nminer\u2019s back line. The engineers didn\u2019t\ngive the RSM time to think when a few\nphases later Rob Dowden slotted a kick\nthrough the eye of a needle and into the\nhands of Tom Beswetherick on the RSM\ntry line, the score line rose to 14-0. The\nengineers made it look easy. The RSM\npack hastily stepped up to the plate and\nproduced some fabulous forward play\ngiving RSM fly half Louie Barn\u00e9t a\ngreat platform to work off. A few phases\nlater the RSM were back in the game\nand the engineers looked worried.\nThe miners constantly used their Russian spawned battering ram Bogdan Golenkov to try and pierce the engineer\u2019s\ndefensive line; however the C&G had an\nanswer in the form of James Allan and\ndebut rugby player Lukas Michalitsch,\nboth of whom putting in some crunching tackles to stop the beast in his tracks.\nThe game was closely fought with\nregular tries from both sides. The RSM\nlooked like taking the lead on several occasions most notable after a well earned\ntry from Simon Fenton in the centres\n(one of six props in the starting line up\nfor the miners). Their organisation in the\npack was very impressive; however, due\nto some great upfront tackling and some\ngood old fashioned flare, the engineers\ntook the victory.\nThe final score: 38-24 to C&G. The\nlast time this happened was 17 years\nago. The RSM have definitely got some\nwork to do if they wish to reclaim their\nprecious bottle. C&G have offered some\ncoaching tips but are yet to hear back.\nMan of the match went to Rob\nDowden for his fantastic kicking game\nand special mention must also go to Sasha Maitala and Tom Beswetherick for\nsome great performances in the backs.\nA 6.30am start proved no hindrance to\nImperial College Ultimate at Indoor Regionals 2010 as dD once again secured\ntheir place at Nationals in Wolverhampton. Three teams were sent to compete\nin Sutton, south London; the first team\ncompeted against the best in the South\nEast, whilst two further teams of new\nplayers held their own to learn the game\nin a competitive environment.\nThe first game of the day saw dD play\nBrunel. The transition from the outdoor\ngame, having only five players and\ncompeting on a hardwood pitch roughly\nthe size of a basketball court, played in\nBrunel\u2019s favour as they played a zone\ndefence through which dD struggled to\nbreak. Despite better communication\nand flow, and a late resurgence, Brunel\ntook the game by one point.\nSublime, from the University of Portsmouth, were dD\u2019s next opponents. Last\nyear\u2019s national champions both outdoors and indoors, Imperial were proud\nto make them work hard for their points\nduring the game and managed to break\nthrough the Portsmouth defence on several occasions. Eventually Portsmouth\u2019s\ninherent quality shone through, leaving\nthe south coast team as deserved win-ners.\nThe match against HU?, from Royal\nHolloway, became a must-win game if\ndD wanted to qualify for Nationals 2010.\nStarting with the intensity that was lacking in the first two games, Imperial put\nenough points on the board to guarantee\nvictory despite a late HU? comeback.\nThis momentum carried through into the\nfollowing game against Chichester, who\nhad no reply to the improving Imperial\nteam which beat them comfortably.\nPlaying with confidence and flair, dD\nfaced up to local rivals UCL.

I recently\nhad a chance to test N.O.V.A. HD on the Samsung Galaxy Tab \u2013 a 7-inch Android tablet.\nAnyone who has played Halo will have a\ngood idea of what N.O.V.A. is like \u2013 you basically walk around and blow up aliens. A space-based first person shooter, the game is set on\nEarth in the distant future. The surface of the\nplanet can no longer support life so huge satellites (\u201cNear Orbitals\u201d) have been constructed\nfor people to live in. Those satellites are protected by the Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance. In\nthe plot of the game, a threat to the satellites\nhas arisen and you must play the role of a retired marine defending humanity.\nI was particularly impressed by the game\u2019s\nintuitive and novel control system. The game\nmakes full use of the gyroscopes available\non smartphones today: to look around and to\naim your gun, you actually have to physically\nmove and aim your phone! It basically turns\nyour living room into the game map - think of\naugmented reality applications such as Layar\nand Google Sky Map but applied to a first person shooter! Whilst playing the game with the\ngyroscope aiming mode enabled made it difficult to play when slumped on the sofa, it really\ndoes add an extra element which was really en-joyable. For those who prefer to play the game\nin a more relaxed setting, there is an option to\ndisable the gyroscope control system. Looking\naround and aiming is then performed using the\ntouchscreen.\nThe game occasionally requires you to interact directly with the map using your touch-screen. For example, doors are opened by placing your finger over the door and pulling it to\nthe side. Again, this was a really nice touch\nwhich sets N.O.V.A apart.\nThe game features 13 single-player \u2018campaign\u2019 levels and an online multiplayer deathmatch mode. The multiplayer mode can either\nbe played over your wireless network or online through Gameloft Live. The multiplayer\nmode would be a huge lot of fun to play over\na wireless network: imagine a bunch of you in\nthe common room walking about, cursing and\ndestroying each other!\nAt \u00a33, this game is definitely well worth a\ndownload. You could get away with playing\nthis on an iPhone or a HTC Desire but for\nthe best experience, it\u2019s well worth playing\nN.O.V.A HD on a phone with a large screen and\nfast processor: the Galaxy Tab\u2019s 7-inch screen\ngives a great immersive experience.\nis the darker, understated music, the torrential\nrain, the action packed vehicle sequence and\nthe presence -f Agent 006 to provide you with\nsome backup and some motivating chat over\nthe radio. New additions also include a regenerating health system and a melee system for\npunching enemies in the face with a flick of the\nnunchuck, to really make you feel like Daniel Craig. It\u2019s clear from all of these features,\nwhich are staples of console shooters such as\nHalo and Call of Duty, that Eurocom\u2019s GoldenEye is out to emulate current games rather\nthan influence them as the original did. Nostalgic as the game may feel at times, especially\nduring classic moments like dropping on a\nRussian guard having a cheeky number two, it\nBlaster\u2019) to put your Wiimote in for a more realistic experience, or play with the Wii classic\ncontroller.\nAs widely touted as the Wii controls are for\nGoldenEye, we didn\u2019t get on well with them.\nIn the fast paced world of online FPS, trying\nto turn 360 degrees and shoot your enemy in\nthe head is painfully slow as you have to hold\nthe Wii cursor at the side of the screen and\nwait. Naturally, after thirty minutes of gameplay things weren\u2019t going too well. I was\nawarded the \u201cQuantum of Solace\u201d award for\nfewest eliminations. It was, however, a lot of\nfun trying to sneak up on up to 7 strangers\nacross the generally well designed multiplayer\nmaps. Switching to the Gamecube controller\nnaturally makes things far more accurate \u2013 the\ngame handles like a conventional FPS with the\nfamiliar dual-analogue controls that everyone\nis used to. Throughout our session there were\nsome issues with lag, and there is no support\nfor WiiSpeak, but otherwise the mode compares favorably with its competitors. It would\nalso have been nice to have seen a larger influence from the franchise \u2013 you can choose to\nplay as a generic grunt but not as any of the\nBond series\u2019 many recognisable faces. \u2018Golden\nGun Mode\u2019 is the only thing that really differentiates the multiplayer.\nTake the multiplayer offline and the action\nslows right down. With only two people, the\nmaps are far too large and multiplayer quickly\nbecomes a bit dull in the regular mode. As there\nis no option for adding AI players, the multiplayer game reduces to just wandering around\nthe map on the off chance of bumping into one\nof your friends doing the same. The N64 may\nnot have been capable of providing some competent bots but the Wii is more than up to the\ntask. Surely it wouldn\u2019t have been too difficult\nto add in the option to have AI characters?\nAlthough the offline multiplayer perhaps\nisn\u2019t high octane enough for modern\nplayers, the finely crafted\nsingle player game is a\ndelight. The levels are var-ied, the shoot out and stealth\ngameplay are deep and the\ngraphics are fine for the Wii.\nThe online multiplayer is a lot\nmore fun than offline but doesn\u2019t\ndraw heavily enough on Bond\u2019s rich\nhistory to stand out against others\nFPSs. The reason it\u2019s worth playing is for the excellent production\nvalues, the all-star cast, the excellent\nNicole Scherzinger cover of the theme\ntune and the chance to experience what a\nBrosnan classic would feel like if it were given\na more anti-heroic Daniel Craig makeover.\nWhether you are doey-eyed with nostalgia for\n1997 or not, Eurocom\u2019s GoldenEye update provides one of the best FPS experiences on the\nWii and gives another great example of how\nmovie tie-ins can work well.\nGoldenEye 007 is available now for Wii\nand DS, retailing at \u00a334.99 RRP.\nW\nhen it was originally released on the N64, Rareware\u2019s GoldenEye 007\nwas hailed as one of the\nmost influential first person\nshooter games of all time and went on to sell\neight million copies. Unlike traditional movie\ncash-ins it was released a leisurely two years\nafter the film on which it was based and as a\nresult featured a painstakingly crafted single\nplayer mode and the perfectly balanced multi-player. Every video game fan and almost everyone else remembers a tense GoldenEye multiplayer battle far more vividly than Diana\u2019s\ndeath or New Labour\u2019s election. It was immensely popular and every subsequent 3D console shooter takes inspiration from it in some\nway. However, after 13 years of evolution in\nFPSs, is Eurocom\u2019s updated version for the Wii\nstill worthy of such praise? The short answer is;\n\u201cof course it isn\u2019t!\u201d But the real questions are:\nis it still fun? Does it work on the Wii?\nOne of the most recurrent problems with the\ngame becomes apparent before you even get a\nchance to don a tuxedo. The text in the menu\nand in-game is a real struggle to read. On the\nmenu, the text is light blue and, over the white\nselector icon, impossible to make out. During the training mission in single player mode\ninstructional text flashes up at the top of the\nscreen but, by the time you have discerned a\nfew of the tiny words, your time is up and the\nnext instruction replaces it. As student reviewers our TV isn\u2019t huge, and it\u2019s surprising so\nlittle attention to detail was paid in this respect\nwhilst production values are high elsewhere.\nHowever, once you have found your\nway to the single player game you\nwill be greeted by a Call of Duty\nstyle briefing from Judi Dench\nas \u2018M\u2019, on the payroll to create\nan authentic Bond experience.\nIt\u2019s clear after the first thirty seconds of gameplay that Eurocom\nhave taken the decision to create\ntheir own take on the 007 experi-ence, rather than simply replicate\nthe award winning formula\nRareware crafted back\nin \u201997. This new\ngame is a remake of\nthe classic, starring\nDaniel Craig as his\nJames Bond, and\nhas been updated\nfor the 21st century.\nIn keeping with\nCraig\u2019s films, GoldenEye 007 opens\nwith a far more\ngritty and brooding atmosphere. The\ncampaign kicks off atop\nthe iconic Arkhangelsk\ndam which should be\nfamiliar to all players of the original.\nWhat isn\u2019t familiar\n...while Jamie Gollings and Alex Gray review GoldenEye 007\nFPS in your\nliving room\nKin-Hing Lo\nsoon becomes apparent what the single player\ncampaign is all about. It isn\u2019t a duplicate of or\neven a tribute to the original game. Instead it\u2019s\na highly polished, slick and modern Bond game\nin its own right, designed to slot in right next\nto the popular shooters of today rather revive\nthose of the 90s. It feels more like some of the\nbetter Bond games of recent years, like Everything or Nothing.\nAfter finishing the training mission and a few\nsingle player levels, it was time to try out the\nbiggest addition to the game: the online mul-tiplayer. This would also give us the chance\nto put the different control systems through\ntheir paces. The two main options are to\nplay with the Wiimote or the Gamecube\ncontroller. You can also purchase a plastic\nholder in the shape of a gun (the \u2018Wii\n\n"

Held at Carbon,\nattendees enjoyed a free glass\nof champagne and a classy atmosphere for a good night. The\nCGCU Slave Auction saw our own\nChief Editor Kadhim Shubber\nsold for \u00a315 amongst others for\nquite a bit more. A cooking sale\ntook place on Thursday, and an\nACC pub-crawl the day after.\nThe most talked about event,\nhowever, was LOST \u2013 in which\nover 100 people participated,\na large contrast to the 27 last\nyear. 2 coaches carried them to\na small town on the coast in Dorset called Christchurch, about\n2 and a half hours away. Participants got free Ben\u2019s cookies,\nfood from Pizza Hut, free beer\nand much more. Over \u00a31000\nwas raised for RAG, and the fastest team to get back were Ben\nKrikler, Lorena Freitas and Simon Good, raising \u00a395.29.\nNew Pro-Rector announced\nPotential undergraduate maths students may find it\nharder to receive an offer from Imperial this year as a\nresult of the A*. Imperial\u2019s Mathematics Department\nhas the highest A level entry requirements in the UK,\nasking for A*A*A with the A*s in Maths and Further\nMaths. Although these criteria are much more demanding than those of other universities, they are\nonly a marginal change from Imperial\u2019s previous highest offer of AAA with As in each maths module. \u201cWe\nrely entirely on the UCAS form and A level results, so\nit is not surprising that our minimal entry requirement\nis higher.\u201d Prof. Alexei Skorobogatov, Imperial\u2019s Mathematics Admissions Tutor, explains.\nA College spokesperson said: \u201cThe College aims\nto identify, attract and develop students of the highest ability and the admissions criteria reflect this\u201d\nand added that \u201cThe A* grade for A levels is one\nway to help academic departments [...] identify\nthose who would benefit most from an education at\nImperial\u201d. However some students believe that the\ncurrent system is unfair. \u201cEveryone always drops\na few marks in exams,\u201d Navid Nabijou, a first year\nundergraduate mathematics student, states, \u201csome\npeople who have a clear knowledge of mathematics\nwill be ruled out because they make errors in cal-culations. Many students also find that they aren\u2019t\nused to the way university mathematics is. A good\nSTEP test mark shows a lot more about mathematical understanding than an A* at A level.\u201d\nThe Sixth Term Examination Paper, or STEP, is\nused by Cambridge University, which requires lower\nA level grades of A*AA. \u201cSTEP is a far better predictor of success in our mathematics examinations\nthan A-levels.\u201d Steve Siklos of Cambridge University\nAdmissions Office believes. \u201cThe questions are less\nstandard and less structured, which helps to distinguish between ability and good teaching.\u201d The STEP\ntest helps Cambridge to select students while preparing them for the sort of mathematics they will experience at university. Interviews are also conducted for all successful applicants, though only 1200\nstudents apply for Mathematics at Cambridge each\nyear. Interviews are logistically difficult to conduct\nat Imperial due to the sheer number of applicants:\n2000 students apply for only 220 places.\nThe current system of A*A*A without interviews or\nadditional tests has only been enforced for a year\nand so it is too early to tell whether it has any real\nfaults. The system is not yet fixed and Imperial may\neven consider an alternative form of testing in future\nyears. \u201cOur admissions criteria are reviewed every\nyear to make sure that we are selecting the best\nqualified students for our degrees\u201d Prof. Skorobogatov reassures.\nZainab Ali\nleadership and governance, we are making\ngovernance changes to become more inclusive\nand that will open doors to other potential associates in the AHSS.\u201d\nAdditionally, Professor Jeff Magee, currently Head of the Department of Computing,\nand Deputy Principal (Research), has been appointed Principal of the Faculty of Engineering\nand will commence his role in January 2011.\nWith over 30 years experience in the field of\nComputer Science research and extensive work\nwith BP, BT, Barclays Capital and others under\nhis belt, he will lead the Faculty of Engineering\u2019s activities and be a member of the senior\ndecision-making body of the College.\nProfessor Magee will succeed Professor Stephen Richardson, Principal and Deputy Rector since November 2009. Sir Keith O\u2019Nions\nwelcomed the appointment and said: \u201cthis is\na demanding job, requiring great energy and\nvision, but over his time at Imperial Jeff has\ndemonstrated these qualities many times over.\nIt is with great confidence and pleasure that we\nwelcome him to his new role.\u201d\nIn response to his appointment to the role,\nProfessor Magee said \u201cThe Faculty of Engineering at Imperial has a world-leading breadth\nand depth of engineering expertise and talent.\nIt is a very great honour and privilege to be\nappointed its Principal, a great opportunity\nto facilitate the application of its engineering\nexpertise to the serious problems that face our\nsociety and a great personal challenge to live\nup to the record of my predecessor.\u201d\nRegarding the senior medical leadership po-sitions, Professor Jenny Higham, Director of\nEducation for the Faculty of Medicine, said\n\u201cThis is an exciting and challenging time for\nImperial\u2019s Faculty of Medicine.

The departments and research groups conducting\nthese fascinating research and education programs are very diverse, encompassing distributed academic networks\nin the physical and biological sciences,\nengineering and business. Whilst this\nis a great strength, it means that finding out about energy-related projects\nand events can sometimes be challeng-ing. The ICU Energy Society seeks to\nprovide a portal for all students, including undergraduates, MScs, MBAs and\nPhDs, so that they may foster information sharing, collaboration and the\nbuilding of a vibrant energy community\non campus.\nCentral to achieving these goals is\nthe creation of a networking platform\nfor all students interested in energy.\nThe ICU Energy Society provides a\nwebsite digesting the energy-related\nnews and events from on- and off-campus and a free mailing list. A key\nprovision currently being developed is\na discussion forum on the IC network\nto facilitate cross-disciplinary discus-sion. In addition to aggregating and\nadvertising existing activities, we have\nbegun to organise our own workshops,\nseminars and social events. Themes of\nevents already being planned include\nprivate investment in renewable en-ergy; the challenge for offshore wind;\ncarbon footprinting; careers in energy\nand sustainability; Clean Development\nin China; business opportunities in en-ergy; a visit to Battersea power station\nand many more.\nThe Energy Society is always looking\nfor new members and new ideas, and\ninvolvement can be anything from attending one of our events to organising\none yourself. Find out more at www.\nic-energy.org or email info@ic-energy.\norg.\nImperial College experts took a key\nrole in the recently-published Roadmap\n2050, a study of the pathways to a low-carbon Europe in 2050 led by the European Climate Foundation. Alongside\ncollaborators McKinsey & Company,\nKEMA and Oxford Economics, the Energy Futures Lab at Imperial assessed\nthe technical and economic require-ments, and implementation challenges,\ntowards meeting the European Council\ntargets of an 80\u201395% reduction in CO2\nfrom 1990 levels by 2050.\nThe Roadmap focuses on the power\nsector, where a large share of the decar-bonisation must happen. The study analyses the potential impact of several technologies in which Imperial has a strong\nresearch profile, including flat-panel and\nconcentrated solar PV, nuclear fission\nand carbon capture and storage. The report concludes that Europe already has\nthe necessary skills, technology, capital\nand industrial capability to make the\ntransition to a low-carbon economy. It\nfound that, whilst the techno-economic\nchallenges will be great, the greatest\nchallenge may be to obtain broad, active\nsupport for the transition across regions,\nsectors and political parties.\nCurrent policies and regulations are\nshown to be well short of what is re-quired; the Roadmap concludes that an\nearnest decarbonisation effort must be\nstarted within around five years to make\nachieving the targets realistic. The good\nnews for policy-makers, the report finds,\nis that if efficiency improvements are\nmade alongside power decarbonisation,\nthe transition can lead to higher economic growth and net positive job creation up to 2050. The full report can be\nread at www.roadmap2050.eu/.\nThree years ago the Union passed its\nEnvironmental policy. It has achieved\nsome substantial gains, such as installing motions sensors on lights in the\nUnion, to turn them off and save energy\nwhen the room isn\u2019t being used.\nWe now use only recycled paper, and\nall publicity is printed on Forest Stewardship Council certified paper. Most\nClub, Society & Project forms are now\nonline, saving paper.\nThe new Environmental Policy for the\nnext three years should use these and\nother benchmarks to take the Union for-ward. It\u2019s up to you what we do, so get\nin touch. Options could be: getting rid of\nbottled water, stricter controls on leaving electronic equipment on overnight,\nor even biodiesel in the minibuses.\nGet in touch at president@imperial.\nac.uk and we can send you the updated\npolicy as it stands. Alex Kendall\nI\u2019m generally against people preaching\nabout vegetarian/veganism, it\u2019s against\nwhat Veg Soc is all about. So let\u2019s assume that you asked us why vegetables\nare awesome for the environment.\nTo keep it simple, red meat and dairy\nare pretty bad in terms of emissions per\ncalorie. It comes down to the inefficiency\nin converting plant foods into animal pro-teins, try and remember back to GCSE\nBiology here.

    "content": "SPORT\n45\nfelix FRIDAY 19 NOVEMBER 2010\nBefore we get on to the frivolities of\nSurfSoc\u2019s weekend, we\u2019d just like to put\nout a quick word of respect to one of the\nbiggest names in the surfing world, who\nsadly passed away last week of dengue\nfever. Andy Irons, 32, was widely regarded as being one of the most genuine,\nin-it-for-real big surfers, an admirable\ntrait in the commercial world of competitive surfing. As someone who represented the true spirit and love of surf,\nhis sudden death hit the community hard\nand we\u2019re amongst the tens of thousands\nwho wish his widowed wife and child-to-be our condolescences. RIP A.I.\nAwkwardly jumping from that sad bit\nof news, SurfSoc\u2019s first trip of the year!\nLondon did its best to discourage our 32\nkeen surfers on Friday, with classically\ngrey skies and droplets of rain giving the\nweekend a bleak prediction. Undeterred,\nmoods were high as our buses trundled\ntheir way towards the coast. A couple of\ntraffic accidents and speed restrictions\nmeant we arrived in Westward Ho late,\nmaking the scrum for beds in the hostel\nall the more vicious. Drinking games\nquickly started up and the rest of the\nnight became a blur of slaps, failed basic\narithmetic and excessive consumption.\nAs ever, people miraculously managed to ignore an epidemic of sore heads\nand shaky limbs the next day, somehow\ncrawling out of bed to hit the beach\nearly. Cold water and a bit of sunshine\nare still undoubtedly the best cure for\nhangovers, sorting out pretty much everyone except for the SurfSoc president,\nwho ended up lamely blaming a bout of\n\u201csea-sickness\u201d for his loss of balance.\nThe Irish contingency showed off their\nhigh calibre, letting Devon know how it\nwas done with a sweet weekend\u2019s worth\nof surfing. Massive kudos to John McGuckin for managing to pull off a cutback on a foamie. Hendrik Frentrup and\nJulius Klein brought about some new\nclass to our ranks with their considerable skill, and kindly lent assistance and\nadvice to the less experienced - good\nfellahs. Lanky James Pye looked like\nsome kind of lighthouse out there, 6\u20194\u201d\nof chilled longboard casualness. Roxy\nJourdain spelt out the opposite, blurring\nacross waves with her bodyboard and\nshouts of ecstatic joy, excellent stuff.\nDario Mazza, Will Hunt and Elliot Taylor and the rest of SurfSoc\u2019s regulars\nall had to be dragged out the water by\nthe day\u2019s end, testament to great waves,\nsunshine and good company.\nOver the afternoon, people trickled\nback to the hostel, hitting the warm\nshowers and beds for some much-need-ed napping. A bodged ginger/apple/or-ange roast pork concoction started off\nthe evening...our hungry surfers managed to polish off over 11 kgs of meat in\none sitting. Nice! Dessert (Tesco Value\ncider, 2 litres of 4.8% death for \u00a31.20)\nwas immaculately presented in a wetsuit\nboot courtesy of Tom Utley. It marked\nthe start of another long night, with Milana Shapira most definitely winning\nthe prize for \u201cLittlest Big Voice\u201d. Lizzy\nGriffiths became victim to the \u201cone girl,\ntwo cups [and a bit of duct tape]\u201d game,\nbut proved her status as our social secretary by leading the party with her smiles\nand giggles all night long.\nSunday\u2019s surf died down a bit, but\nnot enough to stop the extra-keen from\nheading out there before 9AM. Devon\u2019s\nsun came out to play once again, and it\nwas good to see everyone willing to don\ndamp wetsuits, boots and gloves in order to get back into the waves. Things\npicked up as the sun climbed higher, and\nwhen the time came to go, everyone left\nwith water with massive cheesies plastered across their faces.\nThe Darwin Award of the weekend\nhad to go to Serkan \u201cDuncan\u201d Karaagac,\nwho (after a few drinks) decided that\ntackling Ireland\u2019s Kickboxing champion\nextraordinaire, David Harkin, would be\na really, really good idea. It wasn\u2019t, Dave\nrapidly executed a couple of ninja death\nmoves that turned the rascal into some\nkind of mouldable, human-type putty\nrag-doll. He then proceeded to demonstrate with great flourish the various\nanatomical positions a human body was\nnever meant to perform. Once Serkan\nhad been abused enough, a pat on the\nback saw him off merrily in the search\nfor more booze and mischief, somehow none the worse for wear and still\ngrinning ear-to-ear. Additional Darwinian mention goes to Alex Bowers, who\nunsuccessfully attempted to bounce a\nsurfboard off his head (in retrospect, he\nwas quite successful but the board won).\n\u201cHardcore\u201d Harvey could probably use\nsome mention in the Darwin Award\nbooks, but we\u2019re just going to shake our\nheads sadly at him for now, and make\nthe poor lad put on some clothes next\ntime. A shout-out to fresher B.J. King\nfor having the world\u2019s worst initials.\nAll-in-all, the trip proved to be a massive success and the SurfSoc committee\nare proud to say we\u2019ve nabbed a great\nbunch of new Freshers and members.\nHope to see you all, and anyone else\nwanting to get in on the action, next\nmonth when we take on Newquay!\nWaterpolo travel to Aachen despite their sat-nav\nFollowing a prompt departure we began our journey and headed North to\nDover then, after consulting a compass,\nwe turned the map around and were on\nour way. Hydration was key for a successful tournament and to that end Tom\nBF provided the isotonic-like purple\nbeverage. After a brief encounter with\nCustoms, which included some inspired\nfuel saving measures, we were on our\nway to Calais. The inclement weather\nconditions during the crossing addled\nthe brains of some of the younger team\nmembers but a combination of support\nand advice from the more experienced\namongst us and a minibus journey\nthrough four countries with suitable refreshments rectified the situation. Following a brief loss of power to the Sat\nNav, we decided we would circumnavigate AAcen before heading into the City\nCentre for our big arrival. Before turning in for an early night, Jamie decided\nhe preferred a yellow pavement and Peter continued in the civic-minded nature\nof the trip by meticulously inspecting\nthe pavement for cracks. He reported\nfindings to the water department via a\nlarge porcelain telephone.\nWell rested and in high spirits we\nheaded off for our first game of the\ntournament. Our draw was a tough one,\nwe begun by facing last year\u2019s champions where, after a well meaning but\nultimately unsuccessful spell between\nthe posts Ian WP decided to show his\noutfield prowess, maintaining his previous form. Despite this, and after a hard\nfought battle, we were narrowly defeat-ed.\nAfter a light lunch we were ready for\nour next challenge. Some Harry Redknapp style negotiations in the transfer\nmarket brought some native knowledge\ninto the team and resulted in David\nMartinez grabbing our first goal, followed by a dramatic vindication of our\ntransfer dealings as Tim \u201cThe German\u201d\nDetert snatched a second. Unfortunately,\na late rally from the opposition saw the\ngame just slip from our grasp despite a\npowerful defence. Later in the afternoon\nthere were some dubious interpretations\nof the rules by Jack Ellis whilst refereeing a match. This severely damaged international relations with two countries\nand ended his otherwise distinguished\ncareer.\nAfter a brief tug of war, which the\nconscripted contingent assigned to the\ntask claimed was only lost due to \u201cwaterlogged conditions\u201d, we headed to the\nevening\u2019s main event with lofty expec-tations. Mysteriously titled \u201cThe Beer\nRelay\u201d we were hoping that the newly\nshortened course would be to our advan-tage. Fresher Will Stocker stepped forward to enhance his reputation by doing\na double leg which put us into the lead,\nwhich was held for most of the race before Jack was thwarted by the high pool\nsides for a solid 30 seconds. Rich Thoburn helpfully provided post race analysis by demonstrating the effectiveness of\na commando roll in Jack\u2019s situation.\nThe evening ushered in the renowned\n\u201cMid Tournament Party\u201d, arguably the\nhighlight of the competition. After several party games, David excelled at the\n\u201cFresher\u2019s Challenge\u201d, even going the\nextra mile by providing free childcare\nfor several of the parents at the party.\nCertain members of the team opted for\ndifferent ends of the age spectrum, our\ntour sec showing us how it\u2019s done by\nmeeting us at the pool the following\nmorning, bright eyed and ready for more\nWater Polo.\nAfter a team reunion we exchanged\nfragmented memories of the previous\nnight and a renewed sense of optimism\nset in as the team disposed of their\nhangovers as they plunged into cold\nliquid. Joe Gibbs defied the opposition\nand made his international debut on\nthe score sheet whilst Will celebrated\nhis birthday in style by following suit\nshortly afterwards. The second match\nwas presided over by Alex Ferguson,\nwho selflessly declined to play for the\ngood of the team, opting instead to\ntake on a managerial role. This was in\nsharp contrast to Thanasios Platon, who\nwas the only team member to survive\na whole match in the pool. With some\nmembers of the team feeling a little\nworse for wear, rolling subs took on a\nwhole new meaning.\nThe journey back was a welcome rest\nfor many although the game of leapfrog\nbetween the minibus (speed limited to\n62mph) and Nick Ball\u2019s car provided\nadditional entertainment. In the end they\n\u201cmanned-up\u201d to show us that the earlier ferry was not an unrealistic target\n(speeding tickets are in the post).\nThe team now begins training for\nnext year\u2019s tournament, having bravely\npromised to both win and learn German.\nResults: England 0 - 11 Germany;\nEngland 3 - 9 Belgium; England\n1 - 7 Switzerland; England 3 - 6\nGermany.\nIC Waterpolo\nSurfers brave the freezing waves of Westward Ho\nAshton Berry\nThis scene would be even more appealing the sun was blazing and every had a nice cold one in hand\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 19 November 2010 5\nNEWS\nShould international\nstudents plug the\nfunding gap?\nNumbers\ncant amount of money \u2013 but we should\nbe able to keep that [international tuition\nfee] growth under control\u201d.\nInternational students at Imperial currently pay over 7 times the amount that\nhome students pay per annum, though\nthe Higher Education Funding Council\nfor England (HEFCE) subsidizes some\nof the teaching costs for home students.\nInternational tuition fees are set by the\nManagement Board within College in\nthe previous year. When deciding upon\nhow much international students are\ncharged, a college spokesman stated\nthat \u201cImperial takes into consideration\na number of factors, including the fees\nset by its national and international com-petitors, and course demand\u201d.\nThe average tuition fees faced by international students have steadily risen\nsince 2005 and are set to rise by a further\n\u00a3430 for next year. The most noticeable\nexample of an increase in fees is for undergraduate medicine years 1-3, which\nhas been increased by around a third\nsince 2005. International tuition fees\nmust also be paid upfront and on top of\nthat, bursaries for international students\nare few and far between.\nWhen asked whether the current disparity between home fees and international fees was fair, the student reaction was mixed, though it was mutually\nagreed that the issue of international fees\nis controversial.\nOne student, who wishes to remain\nanonymous, believes that he can \u201csee\nthat high fees for foreigners may damage a prestigious university\u2019s ability to\ntake on only the very best students\u201d, but\nthinks that UK students are more likely\nto stay in the UK, which could potentially have positive effects on the UK\u2019s\neconomy and skilled workers base. On\nthis basis, he believes \u201cthe same benefits will not be seen from foreign stu-dents, and so perhaps it is justified that\nthey bear the brunt of university costs\u201d\nthough added that it \u201csounds to me as\nif more bursaries should be offered for\ninternationals \u2013 this would allow UK\nuniversities to acquire outstanding students\u201d.\nAnother difference for the international fee system is that tuition fees are\nnot frozen for the year of entry, which\nmeans that the fees paid by any international students who are currently studying at the university could potentially\nbe affected by changes in the economic\nclimate.\nThe instability of the international fee\nsystem is something that the union finds\nworrying. The union president, Alex\nKendall, believes that \u201cthe [international\nfee] systen needs to be transparent, [in-ternational] students need to know how\nmuch they pay each year\u201d. The union\nwill be discussing this issue with the\nCollege in the coming weeks.\nThe question of how much top universities can charge before overseas applicants are put off by the fees is a tricky\none. An international student, who wishes to remain anonymous, believes that\nfor more well off international students,\nincreasing fees would not deter them\nfrom applying to the UK, but added that\n\u201cfor another part of international stu-dents, maybe the fees will be too high.\nMaybe they will choose to go to other\nEuropean universities, like Germany\nwhich has some universities which don\u2019t\ncharge tuition fees at all\u201d. When asked\nwhether a rise in tuition fees would have\nstopped her from applying to the UK,\nshe answered that it would not have, but\nthat if she was offered a bursary else-where, such as the USA, she would have\nopted to go there instead.\nOn the other hand, raising tuition fees\nfor home students is also fraught with\ncomplications. Imperial student Rebecca Clarke, a 3rd year undergraduate\nphysicist, believes that raising fees for\nhome students would be \u201cmore fair for\nall the non EU students\u201d but she had\nreservations as to whether raising the\ntuition fees for home students would\nbe fair overall, \u201cbecause home students\noutweigh the numbers of international\nstudents, if not at Imperial then certainly\nacross the UK\u201d.\nNot raising the tuition fee cap will\nmean that overseas students may have\nto shoulder the burden of the shortfall\nin funding raising their already substantial tuition fees. Raising the tuition fee\ncap will double or treble the amount of\ndebt that home students leave university\nwith.\nAny increase in tuition fees for home\nstudents will undoubtedly reduce the financial burden faced by their colleagues\nfrom overseas. Nevertheless as the cap\non home tuition fees remains, it is likely\nthat the fees paid by international students will continue to play a disproportionate role in plugging the hole in the\nuniversity\u2019s funding.\n...Continued from Front Page\n\u201cAnother difference\nis that overseas fees\nare not frozen for the\nyear of entry\u201d\nInternational S\nt\nu\nd\ne\nn\nt\ns\nO\nt\nh\ne\nr\nH\no\nm\ne\n/\nEU\nStudents\n\u00a321,800\n\u00a33,290\nInternational\nStudents\n\u00a368.6 million\nHome/EU\nStudents\n\u00a327.2 million\nOther\n\u00a313 million\nTotal funding from fees\nAverage income\nto Imperial per\nstudent\nInternational Students\n\u00a321,800, average upfront international fees\nHome Students\n\u00a33,290 in top-up fees +\n\u00a38,925 (*approx) from\nthe government\nStudent\nratio\nTotal: 3:8\n(international\nvs home)\nUndergrad:\n1:3\n\u00a38925*\n\u00a312,215*\nGraphics by Veronika McQuadeova and Zulfi Khan\n\n"

    "content": "12 felix\nFRIDAY 19 NOVEMBER 2010\nTECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Samuel Gibbs\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nH\naving loved the Blue Yeti a\ncouple of weeks ago, we had\nhigh expectations for Blue\u2019s\nlatest webcam replacement, the\nEyeball 2.0. Featuring Blue\u2019s\nexcellent USB microphone technology, and a\nretractable 2MP webcam, on paper the Eyeball\n2.0 is an excellent upgrade to the stock web\nchat solution built into most modern laptops\nand monitors.\nOn the design front, the Eyeball 2.0 is a nifty\nlittle package, fitting neatly into a slide on hard\nshell for transport, while the pop-out camera\nis pushed into the side of the microphone out\nof harm\u2019s way. Connection to your PC is made\nvia an included mini-USB cable, which unfortunately is too big to be stored inside the case\nto save from losing it, and is worth replacing\nwith a slimmer third-party cable that\nwill.\nAttaching the Eyeball to a\nthin monitor or laptop screen\nis easy, simply looping the\nframe over the edge and letting it sit securely on the top\nedge of your screen. The\ncamera and microphone have\nadjustable angle and can turn\nside to side to point directly\nat you. If you want to put the\nEyeball on a thicker screen, Blue\nprovides a slide-on rubber wedge\nthat frankly looks a bit dodgy, but does\nthe job well enough as long as there\u2019s a sharp\nedge to the back of your screen.\nSo setup is easy, it\u2019s a nice and compact\npackage, but how does it handle? Well here\ncomes the kicker \u2013 the audio as you might\nexpect is spot on, a world above what you get\nwith your built-in mic, or even most headsets.\nThe video on the other hand is atrocious. Its\nslow refresh rate, poor low light handling and\nblocky artifact filled quality are truly poor.\nBlue boast HD video as one of the Eyeball\n2.0\u2019s selling points, and while it may be HD\nresolution, there\u2019s nothing high definition\nabout the quality of the video. The built-in\ncamera of my cheap Dell netbook was\nfar better. Frankly the Eyeball 2.0\u2019s\ncamera reminded me of something\nthat was available 5 years ago,\nover saturated and dealing\nextremely poorly\nwith motion.\nIt\u2019s real shame\nif I\u2019m honest,\nbecause the mic is really quite good, but the\npackage is marred by the rubbish camera, and\nfor that reason alone I can\u2019t recommend it, especially at the \u00a350 asking price.\nFree App of the Week\niOS - eBay for iPhone\nIt\u2019s almost that time of year again, and how better to\narm yourself for Christmas shopping than with the\neBay app for your iPhone. Sold!\n\u201cWhat on earth is that? It looks like\nyou\u2019ve run over a squid and put it on\nyour phone.\u201d My sickened friend was\nreferring to my tricked out Incipio Dotties iPhone 3GS case, complete with\ncustomizable \u2018dottie\u2019 inserts.\nOstensibly there to improve grip, these\ninserts offer little more than to horrify\nfriends and provide cynical cross-selling\nopportunities to Tweens, who want to\nmix and match them in various \u2018dazzling\u2019 colour schemes. Being in the\ngrumpy 30-40 demographic, this largely\ngoes over my head. Frankly, something\nthat\u2019s bobbly, looking like you squished\na tray of smarties onto the back of your\nphone isn\u2019t my cup of tea.\nHowever, bypassing aesthetics for\none moment, the Dotties is a superb\ncase. Excellent grip and sturdy moulding make it feel secure in the hand. Incipio have made it robust enough to not\nflounce out in the average male pocket,\nsomething that can\u2019t be said for some of\nthe cheapo silicon affairs.\nWhile the included screen protectors\nare a nice added bonus to keep your keys\nfrom scratching the screen, the case protrudes along the front edge of the screen\nenough to keep it off the deck when flat\non a table. All in all, thickish rubber with\ncoloured dotties isn\u2019t the most attractive\ndesign, but as far as flexible cases go, its\niPhone protection is excellent. It\u2019s available in eight different colour combinations and can be had for around \u00a325.\nWhat\u2019s that, an iSquid?\nAndrew McDonagh\nAndroid\u2019s not left out of the party.

On Wednesday 3rd they\nshook Heaven\u2019s foundations with the\nexcessive dub that incited chaos on the\ndance floor as they were joined on-stage\nby guests that included the likes of Katy\nB and Ms. Dynamite.\nMagnetic Man towered over the\nDaniel Oppenheimer grills the enigma that is...\nAn interview with\nMicah P Hinson\nM\nicah P Hinson\u2019s music combines lyrical\nwisdom beyond his\ntwenty-nine or so\nyears with the kind of\ndeep, reassuring voice your dad might\nuse to read bedtime stories to you in.\nHailing from Abilene, Texas he is often introduced as \u2018the guy who dated\nthe Vogue model and went to prison for\nforging prescriptions,\u2019 but in person, he\ncomes across as incredibly articulate,\ngrounded and open. Since 2006 he has\nbrought out several EPs and five albums\nthe most recent of which, Micah P Hinson and the Pioneer Saboteurs, just\nreleased.\nWhat was the trigger for your new record and where did the material come\nfrom?\nMost of my records come from the same\nplace. I had started writing half way decent songs around my seventeenth or\neighteenth year so you have a good five\nor six years that I was writing songs a\nlot before I got signed. There\u2019s a lot of\nstuff in the past that I can go back to and\nkind of re-live and bring to my modern\nand my present. I think that\u2019s a really\ngood way to keep solidarity or continuity\nbetween the albums, it\u2019s not just music\nrecorded between each release it\u2019s stuff\nthat\u2019s spanning my whole career.\nYour early records had quite a melancholy style, why did you choose to return to that in The Pioneer Saboteurs\nhaving deviated from it in its predecessor The Red Empire Orchestra?\nI did The Red Empire with a guy\ncalled John Congleton from The Paper Chase; a really fucking frightening\nband-amazing epic stuff. He was kind\nof the one and only producer I\u2019ve ever\nhad and been able to say to \u2018here\u2019s what\nI\u2019m doing, what do you want me to re\ndo, how do you want things to sound?\u2019\nThat\u2019s why that sounded so different,\nbut I still think that record has its hefty\nbit of darkness. I guess I see this new\nrecord as a culmination of the sound I\u2019d\nbeen gathering in all the different re-cords. It was good to head back in that\ndirection but I guess I never really went\naway from it because there are a lot of\nstrange, loud and haphazard things on\nThe Red Empire. It\u2019s hard to categorise things man, when you get down\nto the nitty gritty there\u2019s similarities\nbetween so many things you wouldn\u2019t\neven guess.\nYou\u2019ve been defined on many occasions by the dark stories of things that\nhappened in the past. Does that frustrate you?\nAs we were coming in to London this\nmorning I was telling a story about this\ninterview I did in Australia. This woman\ncomes up and is like, \u2018Hello! This morning we have Micah Hinson, drug ad-dicted, woman toting, complete ass hole\n\u2013 he\u2019s actually been in a mental institution!\u2019 Then she went on to ask me the\nsame question and I told her it\u2019s actually a good thing for me to speak about\nit because the more I speak about it the\nless real it becomes. Clearly, I need to\nremember things to learn from them,\nyou have to remember certain parts of\nthe past in order not to relay them in to\nthe future but it does help to talk about\nthem. I mean I was born in to a higher\nmiddle class family in Texas, my parents were church goers, there wasn\u2019t any\nreal reason for me to twist off and do\nthe things I did, whether that be drugs\nor going to jail and all this. I made those\ndecisions myself whereas some people\nin life they aren\u2019t given a chance, their\nparents are cock-suckers, their brothers are drug dealers et cetera et cetera.\nI was given much more of a chance and\nmade bad decisions that led me to hard\ntimes so it\u2019s kind of a strange thing to\nhave sympathy on any of those matters\nbecause they were my choice.\nThere are people with a similar modern folk sound to your own who\u2019ve\nbroken in to the mainstream. Does\nit bother you to see other people, for\nwhatever reasons, blowing up?\nOh no, no man that doesn\u2019t bother me\nat all! With the idea of a bomb blowing\nup, it has to go out. That\u2019s what I fear. I\nwould never want to be a bomb, I would\nmuch rather be the slow burning fuse\nlike four miles away from the enormous\nwarehouse full of gun powder, know\nwhat I\u2019m saying? It takes forever to get\nthere, I mean it may even only get there\nin my death but slow and steady wins the\nrace. Unless you\u2019re fucking U2 or The\ngoddamn Eagles, bands don\u2019t last. I\u2019m\njust thankful for every minute that I get to\nkeep doing this. You just hope that when\npeople go up they don\u2019t come down too\nhard. Some people can rise and they can\nstay but it\u2019s few and far between. The\nmasses are pretty unforgiving and the\ngods are pretty unforgiving too.\nMagnetic Man rumbles Heaven\ncrowd from a suspended cage plastered\nwith screens sporting images that had\neven the teetotallers tripping balls beyond belief. An impressive light show\nalways goes down a treat with this sort\nof thing and theirs was certainly flaw-less: they even hopped on the festive\nbandwagon producing Halloween imag-ery, which I hesitate to admit was pretty\nscary at times. They banged out all of\nthe greats from the album in perfect sequence in addition to some new mixes, a\nreal Halloween treat.\nA personal highlight was the live adaptation of \u2018I Need Air\u2019 which is by far\nthe best live dance tune I\u2019ve boogied on\ndown to for a while, if not ever, even in\nspite of the rushing, gurning mess of a\nguy stood next to me who insisted on\ncovering me in sweat through gritted\nteeth. People, eh? The set was a sequence of carefully interwoven melodies that quickly turned dirty and by\ncontrast made the drops seem much\nmore dramatic.\nIf you enjoy adrenaline-fuelled noise\ncoupled with temporary blindness and\na total inability to hear whatever your\nlecturers happen to be talking about the\nsubsequent morning (assuming you\u2019re\nalive) these are definitely ones to watch.\nGet in there fast because no doubt the\ntickets won\u2019t be \u00a315 for subsequent tours\nas they make a name for themselves as\none of the filthiest (apparently words denoting dirt are synonymous with \u2018good\u2019\nin this genre) groups on the scene.\nChristopher Richardson\nDrug addicted, woman toting, complete ass-hole...

Henry, the not-so-evilAmerican\nwho is replacing the most definitely evil\nAmerican former-owners of my beloved\nLiverpool. How romantic it would have\nbeen, after all, to celebrate Mr Henry\u2019s\narrival on these grey shores by engrossing myself in anything and everything to\nwith America.\nWe Liverpool fans love America, after all. We\u2019ve always loved it. I for one\ncertainly do not remember the hatred towards Messrs. Gillette and Hicks spilling over into anything untoward being\nsaid about their homeland. Any flags to\nthe effect of \u2018Yanks Out\u2019 that you think\nyou may have seen at Anfield over the\nlast number of years were probably a\nfigment of your imagination.\nHowever, rather than being the product of a definitely-not-xenophobic\nfootball fanatic, this article was born\nthrough far more mundane circum-stances. Somewhere between studying\nstochastic calculus and contemplating\nthe ramifications of my own withering\nHugh McDowell\nThis kind of move can get you to the nationals...in Wolverhampton\n...Continued from back page\nUltimate Frisbee\nqualify for Wolverhampton nationals\njob prospects, I received a timely and\ncheerful message from my editor/supe-rior, demanding I write something about\nbaseball. Being the obedient subordinate\nthat I am, I obliged.\nRelatively speaking, the Imperial Falcons are a young club. Founded in the\nsummer of 2009, the Falcons boast an\nimpressive record of success, and have\nalready won this year\u2019s Fall Cup, which\nfeatures the top six university teams\nin the country. The team remain undefeated this season and hope to follow\non from the Fall Cup by defending their\nSouthern League title.\nThe team trains every Wednesday,\nvarying between Harlington, Hyde Park,\nand Northwick Park batting cages. Work\non a baseball pitch at Harlington which\nwill allow Imperial to host matches\nis nearing completion. The team is\ncoached by the club\u2019s senior members,\nseveral of whom are accredited coaches.\nOne Falcon, Kevin Ling, is keen to\nstress the inclusive nature of the club:\n\u201cThe club welcomes all, irrespective\nof ability. A lot of returning members,\nwhich had no experience with the sport\nbefore joining, are now integral parts\nof the Falcons and have earned starting\nroles.\n\u201cThe team embodies the philosophy of\ncamaraderie and team work. One of the\nwinning factors the Falcons have is the\nencouragement that can be heard from\nthe field and dugouts. We play because\nwe enjoy being in a competitive team\nand have a collective interest in Baseball, whether acquired or not.\u201d\nThe club owes a debt of gratitude to\nSport Imperial, which it says have been\nvery supportive of the fledgling Falcons.\nIt provided the club with an equipment\ngrant as well as helping to construct the\nclub\u2019s first pitch and mound at Harlington. Ling also cites support received\nfrom the Union and from the Harlington\nGrant as instrumental in the club\u2019s suc-cess.\nAlthough the club is still considered\n\u2018new\u2019, Ling says that they have had little\ndifficulty in recruiting; there were over\nfifty attendees at their first ever training\nsession last year. He is keen to stress that\nthe club welcomes beginners. \u201cNo previous experience is necessary; the basics\nof the sport can be taught very quickly,\nall you need to do is turn up to sessions.\nEvery single person on the team is learning all the time.\u201d\nstructed their zone defence. Recording\na 9-1 victory, Imperial took their biggest win of the season so far. Despite\nthis rout, dD finished third in their pool,\nlosing on a head-to-head tiebreaker with\nBrunel. The final game of the day saw\ndD play a crossover against the University of Kent third team who, despite\nat one point being 2-1 up, proved little\nchallenge for Imperial, who duly took\nthe victory.\nSunday was a very important day, with\neach team that Imperial played knowing\nthat a loss could see them miss out on a\nNationals spot. The University of Reading provided Imperial\u2019s first opponents\nof the day and, with both teams evenly\nmatched, the game was gritty and tight.\nDespite a tough performance dD came\nout on top, grinding out a win on a sud-den-death point. Roehampton University, fresh from their defeat of King\u2019s College London, gave Imperial their next\nheadache, giving nothing away cheaply\nand forcing dD to play hard and smart.\nAnother close game saw Imperial win\nby a single point.\nThe mysteries of scheduling meant\nthat dD knew their opponents for their\nnext match very well, having played\nBrunel less than thirty-six hours ago.\nImperial were a very different team\nfrom the one that played the day before\nand competed with the confidence that\ndeveloped over the tournament. Winning by a solid margin, Imperial earned\na rematch against Portsmouth. With the\nwinner of the game qualifying for Division 1, and the losers Division 2, dD\nknew it was all to play for. In front of a\ncapacity crowd, Imperial played coolly\nand had the vast majority of possession,\nbut mistakes were forced and Sublime\u2019s\ntransition from defence to offence was\nfast and effective. Portsmouth took the\nspot for Division 1, but in qualifying for\nDivision 2 Imperial have the opportunity to defend the trophy they won last\nyear.\nImperial\u2019s other teams gave good performances and, despite having only a\nhandful of experienced players, matched\nup to several quality sides. The second\nteam, dD2, started the tournament with\na resounding win over the University\nof Surrey\u2019s Mohawks 3, followed by\na tough game against Thrown 2, from\nKing\u2019s College London. Even playing\nteams ranked up to thirteen places above\nthem, dD2 showed cool heads to score\nwell-worked points but, owing to the\nlack of tournament experience, could\nmanage only conciliatory scores in their\nfinal match against Kent 3. With an average of less than a month\u2019s experience\nacross the team, dD3 suffered a steep\nlearning curve but no loss of enthusi-asm. Overcoming the first-tournament\nnerves quickly, dD3 kept calm and\nplayed smart. Their team spirit shone\nthrough as they maintained the dream of\nqualifying for Nationals until, and even\nafter, it was impossible.\nOnce again Imperial College Ultimate qualified for Nationals, to take\nplace later this month. Gelling as a team\nand playing with confidence and style,\ndD displayed the qualities necessary to\nperform at the highest level and go to\nWolverhampton to defend their Division\n2 title. With both of the other Imperial\nteams holding their own at such a competitive tournament, the future bodes\nwell for this year\u2019s influx of new players\nwho, this time next year, could be looking forward to a place at Indoor Nationals 2011.\nThey were all so happy that they didn\u2019t notice the cheeky chap on the right, nicking their trophy\n\n"

Hilarity ensues\nWhen travelling turns trippy\nChris Richardson proves that there\u2019s hope for Imperial guys after all... Damn lucky bastard\nT\nightly nestled among the\nhappy snaps and hilarious\nanecdotes lie the problems\nyou\u2019re bound to run into\nwhile on the road. For the\nsake of saving your relatives a heart attack it\u2019s probably for the greater good\nthat these are reserved for the likes of\nmemories and private journal entries,\nbut I\u2019ll share a great one of mine with\nyou. I suppose my only real regret is\nthat my evening after getting my drink\nspiked was unfortunately nothing like\nThe Hangover.\nSo there I was on the beauty that is Koh\nPhi Phi in Thailand: I was sat with an\narm around my girlfriend Hannah (with\nwhom I\u2019d been recently reunited after\ntwo months apart) and a frosty beer in\nmy other hand, gazing up a blissful night\nsky from a sandy white beach thinking\nlife simply couldn\u2019t get any better. Little\ndid I know that my blissful illusion was\nabout to be shattered. Thankfully my life\nphilosophy is \u2018shit happens\u2019 so I wasn\u2019t\ntoo disgruntled.\nHannah is famous for (amongst other\nthings) her inability to withstand long\nnights out, so part of the recipe for disaster was her deciding to leave me on\nmy lonesome for the evening while she\ntucked in early (or ran off with a Thai\nman: who knows?). No big deal, right?\nI\u2019d been travelling solo for months so\nwas more than acquainted with the tiresome process of befriending total strangers and so on. And this party island was\nfull of people looking for good times, so\noff I set to the nearest beach bar.\nThankfully I had an accomplice by my\nside who I\u2019d bumped into en-route, so\nwe sat on some bean bags and ordered\n\u201cAt least my bank\ncard and anal virginity were kept intact\u201d\nlight show commemorating the half\nmoon (any excuse to celebrate, right?).\nBy the time I made it to the bathroom I\nknew that something was rotten in Denmark and proceeded to stuff my bank\ncard into my pants (classy), leaving but\na few tuppence in my dusty wallet to detract potential thieves.\nAs the paranoia gripped I decided that\nthe most discreet mode of exit from the\nbar would be via the Hollywood walkway that was the back alley. I suppose\nthe logic in my twisted head was that nobody would follow me and that I could\nget back quickly and get help. I escaped\nonto the main street with some minor\ninjuries and a light coating of mystery\nsludge on my shins.\nI\u2019d been on Koh Phi Phi for about\nfive days before this hilarious incident:\nI\u2019m not a moron when it comes to directions and besides, the island has one\nmain street and another branching from\nit, where my hostel was located. The fact\nis that I knew my way around with ease,\nyet in this stupor it was all a blur.\nI started being recklessly illogical\nwith my subsequent decisions on the\nway home: I was sort of in control but\ncompelled to do ridiculous things. At\nevery hotel I passed I demanded that\n\u201cit\u2019s an emergency!\u201d and that the security guards give me all of their pens,\nwhich I proceeded to run away with.\nCluster of pens in hand and staggering\nlike Frankenstein\u2019s beast I approached a\ngang of Thai youths on motorbikes and\nin true lad fashion demanded \u201clet\u2019s have\na go on yer bike son\u201d and was lucky to\nbe sent on my merry way by a push of\nhands rather than a torrent of fists.\nBy this point my stomach had started\nto disagree with whatever it was that\nwas slowly taking me over and I proceeded to \u2018chunder everywah\u2019 in true\n\u2018gap yah\u2019fashion. Ironically this was the\nonly time on my trip where I threw up,\nor so I remember. When you\u2019re walking\nthrough a party district leaving a Hansel and Gretel trail of vomit behind you,\nyou\u2019re hardly greeted with grins. You\u2019ve\nobviously had one (or ten) too many, are\nmaking a fool of yourself, and are unworthy of any help.\nI thought that good Samaritans only\nexisted in works of fiction but eventually one came to my aid. Through bile\ncoated teeth I managed to dribble the\nname of my guesthouse to my new best\nfriend who was apparently a walking\nLonely Planet \u2013 he knew the location of\nmy guesthouse and was eager to get me\ntucked up in bed. I could sense something wasn\u2019t quite right as he pulled me\ncloser to darkness and out of town, so\nquickly latched myself onto an elderly\nThai lady, waving some money in her\nface, just begging to be taken home.\nAfter two hours of wandering the same\n50 metre stretch of road, sicky and sob-bing, it turns out I\u2019d been approximately\noutside of my hostel the entire time. She\nled me the few paces to my door and\nsent me on my merry way, and refused\nto take my money. Meanwhile, a certain\nsomeone in the land of nod was about to\nbe woken by a pleasant surprise.\nAny movement or attempted sipping\nof water induced nausea, and my knight\n(nurse) in shining armour (nightie) ensured that I didn\u2019t die overnight. Eventually I made it to the bed and slept solidly\nfor a good few hours and when I eventually awoke I was severely disorientated\nand achy. For the few days that followed\nI struggled to navigate the streets that\nwere so obvious the previous day, and\noften had problems keeping up with\nconversation \u2013 my short term memory\nhad been totally shot.\nKoh Phi Phi is still one of my favourite Thai islands and this didn\u2019t detract\nfrom the fun times at all. I\u2019d heard tales\nof people having everything robbed, being held at gunpoint and being spiked\nby evidently much worse chemicals like\npetrol (which stopped a girl from taking\nher flight home), so by comparison I felt\nlike I\u2019d got off quite lightly \u2013 considering the circumstances I could have came\nout of that situation much worse off.\nGod knows what was in the drink, or\nwho was responsible, or what would\nhave happened had I consumed the entire thing. I guess I should have taken the\n\u2018watch all of your drinks being opened\u2019\nadvice I\u2019d had rammed down my throat,\nbut you live and learn.

Now, I\u2019m no heavyweight, but I\ndon\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so off my face\nfrom half a bottle of beer in all my life.\nSensing that something was up, I haphazardly staggered to the stinky men\u2019s\nroom to examine myself in the mirror.\nThat seemingly simple task was skewed\nby my seized up legs and the excessive\n\n"

Made with\nyoghurt, fresh mangos, crushed ice and\nmilk, it is healthy yet refreshing.\nThe Kebab Ke Karishma starter was\nspot on, with a mint sauce that was not\ntoo sour or minty but added zing to the\nmeat. The traditional dish, Dansak, was\nthe highlight of the night, with an initial\nspicy taste that progressed to a subtle\nsweetness before ending on a slight sour\ntaste! I yearn for it as I reminisce. Usually I steer clear of chicken and opt for\nsomething else instead because there\nis nothing worse than having a mouthful of dry chicken that you\u2019re trying to\nswallow down with as much saliva produce as possible. Nasty. But the chicken\nin the Dansak is tender, moist and soft.\nDipped with Naan bread, this is heaven\nin a curry house.\nThe King Prawn Malabar combined\ncoconut, spices and nuts in a puree as a\nthick sauce which is smothered over the\nprawns and presented to you in a steaming hot plate. Picking up the naan bread\nand then slowly dipping and savour-ing the smell and taste. Finger lickin\u2019\ngood. Did I mention that the naan bread\nhere is sweet? It\u2019s also smooth, soft, yet\nthick enough for scooping up those excess sauce puddles on the dish that are\njust too good to leave behind. I\u2019m salivating now just thinking about the dish.\nLocated close to Truman Brewery,\nSheba has been serving Londoners since\n1972 so I am not the only happy customer they get. What\u2019s better than sitting down to a splendid curry after a day\nof browsing vintage clothes and bargain\nhunting in Brick Lane. Although located\nin trendy East London, (as are all good\nthings, Shoreditch sigh), it is definitely worth the trek.\nSheba 136 Brick Lane, London E1 6RU.\nwww.shebabricklane.com Nearest tube:\nShoreditch High Street\nMasala Zone, Earls Ct\nby George McIntyre\nHow about this: instead of spending\nyour \u2018hard earned\u2019 student loan on an\nunfulfilling Domino\u2019s pizza, why not try\nout, very possibly, one of the best Indian\nrestaurants around, Masala Zone.\nThis place prides itself on authentic\nIndian cuisine at reasonable prices.

One particularly memorable section involves an ice lake cracking around your Aston\nMartin as you desperately pursue a dastardly\nvillain escaping by train. It most definitely puts\nElectronic Arts\u2019 interminable 2000 clunker 007\nRacing to shame \u2013 and the entire focus of that\nwas the driving.\nHowever thrilling these sequences are, they\ndo particularly rely on some trial and error \u2013\nthe fantastic visuals of these sections do help\ndraw some of your attention away from the incoming lake \u2013 and, in a similar style to Project\nGotham Racing, Bond\u2019s cars are remarkably\nindestructible and bounce off walls like a hyperactive child. Probably the main criticism is\nthat there isn\u2019t enough vehicle-bound action to\nbalance out the run-and-gun segments, especially in comparison to Everything or Nothing.\nAs with every modern shooting game released nowadays, there is an online multiplayer that tries very hard at being the \u2018next\nbig thing\u2019. Ranks and experience points feature\nheavily but sadly more time should have been\nspent on the ol\u2019 running around and shooting\nitself, as compared to the single player Blood\nStone\u2019s performance here is mediocre.

No,\nBoris Johnson hasn\u2019t won a\nsnap mayoral election, but instead Daniel Craig has stepped\nback into the shoes of James\nBond for two (count \u2018em) new videogame re-leases. 007 Blood Stone is an original adventure for the Bond series, not being based on any\ncurrent or future film, which mixes third person behind-the-shoulder shooting with classic\nvehicular chase sections. A departure from the\nprevious franchise entry Quantum of Solace,\nBizarre Creations (creators of popular racing\nseries Project Gotham Racing) takes over from\nTreyarch and Eurocom as developers. They\u2019ve\ndecided to return to a formula that feels a lot\nlike that from critically lauded 2004 console hit\nEverything or Nothing, but have the new kids\non the block struck gold(finger), or are they\nsimply dead on arrival?\nWith the next cinematic installment of the\nfranchise still a way off, Blood Stone is probably the closest you\u2019ll get to a new Bond ex-perience. Bizarre have produced a highly polished title with some slick graphics and have\nenlisted A-list voice talent including Craig\nhimself alongside Judi Dench as \u2018M\u2019 and song-stress Joss Stone (sans transatlantic twang) as\nthe obligatory Bond girl.\nOne thing Blood Stone gets right is that it really nails the feeling of Daniel Craig\u2019s Bond.\nDon\u2019t expect any world domination schemes\nby nanobot or platinum tank. This is nearer the\nknuckle stuff, involving a global biochemical\nconspiracy, copious torture and a villainous\nMongolian chap. If this all sounds a bit serious,\ndon\u2019t worry \u2013 the creators have added enough\nextravagant set pieces to remind you that it is\na game, including a hugely entertaining pre-credits sequence set in Athens which provides\nyacht bound espionage, a harbour speedboat\nchase, a shoot-out on land and a car chase all in\nthe space of the first 10 minutes.\nGameplay-wise, the shooting sections play\nssimilarly to Gears of War with a focus on cov-er-based shooting, though with cover feeling\na lot more natural, indestructible woodwork\naside. One of the unique features is a \u2018focus\naim\u2019 system: brutal melee takedowns earn up\nto three focus aims which allow the player to\nimmediately target and even link headshots, for\nuse either in dispatching difficult enemies or to\nspeed up progress.\nThe game manages to create a great sense of\nurgency through these mechanics, aided in part\nby a fantastic score by Richard Jacques. Gunfights are often tense, and while some may argue that towards the middle of the game many\nof the shoot-outs become repetitive, the combination of frantic shooting and mel\u00e9e action do\nhelp to create a uniqueness to each encounter.\nA standout battle that defines the \u2018be Daniel\nCraig\u2019 mentality of the game takes place on a\nhovercraft, where a corridor of heavily armed\nenemies lies in wait. You easily blast through\nthis, moving from person to person in a brutal\nseries of hand-to-hand takedown moves that\nleaves skulls cracked and legs broken, yet the\nDouble trouble from Daniel C\nMatt Colvin tries the new Bond title 007 Blood Stone...\n32\nPanda\u2019s Big Adventure\ntinyurl.com/pandasbigadventure\nThis point-and-click puzzle adventure sees the titular\npanda travelling through time in a somewhat familiar blue box. Although it\u2019s just your standard formula\nwith no weird time travel effects, it\u2019s still pretty fun\nfor a quick play and the puzzles, if a little odd, can be\ngenuinely quite challenging in places.\nall that good, and trying to beat big name titles\nlike Gears at their own game is unfortunately\ndoomed to failure. The controls become sluggish and don\u2019t seem particularly suited for\nmultiplayer. Trying to use cover is difficult,\nand the uninspiring multiplayer arenas are not\ndesigned well enough to accommodate it.\nAnd sadly the criticisms don\u2019t end there.\nThere is next to no replay value despite the\nstandard achievements or trophies. Scoring\nthe player and unlockable rewards have been\noverlooked in favour of a more cohesive and\ncinematic experience (which, it must be said, is\none of Blood Stone\u2019s strong points).\nWhile the game makes you feel like Daniel\nCraig, his in-game face ironically looks a lot\nless lifelike than fictional characters, and let\u2019s\nnot get started on Judi Dench, with an avatar\nwrinkled into oblivion. You\u2019re also slightly\naware that Craig is sitting in a voice-over booth\nrather than in several exotic locales, matched\nby a plot that, while suited to Craig\u2019s interpre-tation, doesn\u2019t exactly match the depth of the\nlast two Bond films.\nBizarre Creations have obviously taken\na lot of care in making sure that they do the\nfranchise the justice that it deserves, delivering a thoroughly cinematic experience that is\ndefinitely entertaining while it lasts, yet after\nit does end, it doesn\u2019t leave a lot to go back\nto. It\u2019s definitely a solid experience, though one\nthat\u2019s more akin to a DVD than a game \u2013 you\u2019ll\nreturn to it occasionally and certainly enjoy it,\nbut have little reason to return to it often.\n007 Blood Stone is available now on Xbox\n360, PS3, DS and PC.\nYeah, nice cool pose idiot, pity you\u2019re about to get punched in the face\n\n"

No one comes\nthrough the Father except through me.\u201d\nThis raises the question of whether Jesus\u2019 teaching, and consequently Christians\u2019 attitude towards human freedom,\nis fundamentally oppressive. I wish to\nshow how the teaching of Jesus is not\noppressive, but is actually in line with\nthe heart of the idea of human freedom.\nThere is a difference between engaging on an endeavour to truth openly, and\ndeviating from the existence of absolute\ntruth. To engage on a pursuit to the truth,\none accepts that there are absolute truths\nto be found, and it is human\u2019s task to\nseek evidence to arrive at them. That is\nfundamentally different to asserting that\nthere is no absolute truth in life, and one\nmust be willing to accept the possibility of many different mutually exclusive\npropositions being true simultaneously;\nit is not pluralism.\nAt the heart of desiring freedom of\nspeech, there is an underlying hope in\nwanting to arrive at absolute truth with\ncertainty. Often freedom of speech\ncomes to the spotlight when we think\nour perspective that we regard as true in\nlife is being suppressed. This automatically presupposes a belief that certain\npropositions about life are absolutely\ntrue. Thus, it is the engagement to a particular endeavour to truth that we wish\nto obtain through the freedom of speech,\nnot the denial of the existence of truths\nPOLITICS\nFELIX\n14\nPolitics Editors: Hassan Joudi, Rory Fenton\nJames Lees, Rajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nShould there be limits\nM\ninister for Communities and Local Government, Andrew\nStunnell visited Imperial last month to\nspeak at Interfaith\u2019s student led debate\non the right to freedom of speech.

Below are summaries\nof the speeches from each of the speak-ers. Please note, these are the views and\nreligious interpretations of the individu-als, not their respective societies.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nIraq\nThailand has extradited suspected arms dealer\nViktor Bout to the United States to face terrorism\ncharges.\nHe stands accused of attempting to sell arms to the\nFARC rebels of Columbia and faces a potential life\nsentence.

Viktor Bout\u2019s extradition\ncomes after months of legal wrangling in the Thai\ncourts the extradition request.\nThailand\nIraqi President Jalal Talabani has refused to sign\nthe execution order of former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.\nPresident Talabani has refused sign the order on\nthe grounds that Mr Aziz is a Christian, aging and\nreported to be seriously ill. Mr Aziz was previously\nsentenced to death by an Iraqi tribunal for persecuting Islamic minorities in Iraq which was classified as\na crime against humanity. Tariq Aziz was the international face of Iraq under Saddam but was not seen\nas one of Saddam\u2019s evil insiders.

South Sudanese living in the North have begun the long journey\nback to the South to register amidst fears of intimidation in the North and that their vote with be miscounted as part of an attempt to prevent the South from\nleaving.

Restricting it,\nespecially in religious settings, is inherently bad.\nIn our personal lives, we exercise\nour right to freedom of speech to be\nperceived as a unique individual with\npersonal thoughts and opinions. From\nthe rhetoric of politicians to the gossips\nof neighbours, speech is used by all to\nexpress their innate humanity and per-sonality. Constraining the freedom of\nspeech, therefore, is analogous to dehu-manising individuals.\nIn broader society, freedom of speech\nis essential to political and religious critique or dissent. Voicing the public opin-A secular view\nfrom IC Debating\nSociety\nA Christian\nperspective from\nEdward Ip\nThat poor chap doesn\u2019t look particularly healthy... Hey bro! Let go of him already!\nthemselves and consequently arriving at\nan ad hoc freedom of speech (ability to\nsay whatever we want.)\nTo summarise, freedom of speech\nmust mean a possibility to engage on an\nendeavour to arrive at the true proposition of life, rather than the acceptability\nof any feasible attempt to this task. Our\nend goal is to arrive at the truth via this\nengagement, which is an exclusive position (excluding propositions that are\ncontradictory to the supposedly true\nproposition), but where engagement is\nstill possible having arrived at this posi-tion. Further, this is to be done in harmony with each other, with mutual respect\nand care for each other.\nThe teachings of Jesus are of such a\nnature. He proclaimed his teaching is\nunique and exclusive. This means that he\nexcludes the possibility of all other teachings being true, apart from his own. But\nwhat is at the heart of this exclusive mes-sage? Firstly it is a message of love; that\nwe should love God\u2019s character and love\nour neighbours as ourselves. Secondly,\nit is a message of truth; the accessibility to the truth is possible through Jesus\nhimself. Thus at the heart of the gospel\nof Christianity is one that wishes man to\nlove each other and to pursue the truth,\nnamely, knowledge of God\u2019s personal\nand infinite nature. This is what is nonnegotiable and exclusive about Christianity, and whatever opposes that, Jesus\nclaimed, is a false description of life.\nJesus\u2019 teachings concur with the heart\nof why man desires freedom of speech.\nI challenge the reader to carefully distinguish the difference between promoting\nfreedom to engage openly in finding the\nway to truth and the seeming freedom\ncreated by the acceptance of any feasible\nclaims of truth, which is not freedom at\nall. For in doing so we have completely\nbetrayed the whole purpose of desiring\nfreedom of speech.\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nIllustration by Mitesh Patel\n\n"

But, in Annie Hall\n\u2013 before Allen got into slightly dubious Lolita-esque\nterritory - that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s so charming. This is\na film about a relationship that goes through all the\nregular things \u2013 bad advice from friends, clinging to\nsomething you know won\u2019t work, and the last-ditch\nattempts to give it one last shot.\nWoody Allen is perfect, playing a character who is\nessentially himself, alongside Diane Keaton as Annie Hall, alternately accelerating and trying to halt\nthe car crash that is their relationship. Keaton also\ndeserves a mention for portraying a brilliantly lov-able, New England oddball with an amazing sense\nof style. Also, cameos from younger versions of Jeff\nGoldblum, Christopher Walken and Paul Simon (of Simon & Garfunkel) are all pitch-perfect and very funny.\nIn a classic Woody Allen-style tone, his character\nAlvy Singer opens with a neurotic, twitchy monologue\ndirectly to the camera that perfectly encapsulates the\nnature of what is to follow in a couple of nervously-blurted jokes and stuttered statements. \u201cAnnie and\nI broke up,\u201d he says, \u201cand I still can\u2019t get my head\naround that.\u201d This is one of Annie Hall\u2019s many wonderful qualities \u2013 for a film that is a romantic comedy\n(albeit an off-beat one), it begins with the break-up.\nIt isn\u2019t a fluffy, skipping-through-fields-with-open-arms, kind of love story \u2013 it\u2019s a very human series\nof events. One of my own personal favourites is the\nlobster scene, which sees a near-slapstick fumbling\nwith live lobsters as Alvy and Annie try to stop their\ndinner escaping. This scene is endearing, beautifully\nexemplifying one of those perfect moments in a relationship where everything is going well. What makes\nAnnie Hall so great, though, is later in the film, after\nthe break-up, where Alvy shamelessly tries to reconstruct this moment with a new girlfriend. She leans,\ndisinterested, against the kitchen counter as Alvy\nfails to recreate that same charm Annie had. The\ndisappointment is almost palpable, and continues\nto be with the caricatures of girlfriends Alvy Singer\ndates, who never quite compare to Annie.\nOne of Allen\u2019s best, this film is warm, sharp and\nreally very funny. More than that, though, it is one\nof the most honest portrayals of a relationship I\u2019ve\never seen.\nJade Hoffman\nDown it, Allen.\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nMatt Allinson\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLast week I visited a preview of Sky One\u2019s new\nseries of Christmas specials, Little Crackers, as\nhosted by BAFTA. They are a part of a plan by\nthe channel to introduce more original comedy\nand make Sky One a \u201cwarmer, funnier place\u201d,\nwith the series consisting of twelve stand-alone\nshorts. Showing as a double bill every evening\nin the weeks leading up to Christmas, they give\nsome of Britain\u2019s best known comedic stars the\nchance to bring their vision to the nation\u2019s TV\nscreens.\nFans of Stephen Fry will be very pleased\nby his film, Bunce: A Christmas Tale, which\nis directed by Peter Cattaneo of Full Monty\nfame. An autobiographical work about his\nexperiences as an 11 year old at boarding\nschool, it details Fry sneaking out to the local\nvillage shop to buy sweets. Fry has stated that\nhe wanted this to represent our desire for \u201cthe\nforbidden\u201d, but in the safe setting of childhood and this is done brilliantly, contrasting\nthe shop\u2019s rich, bright colours and the dull,\ngrey school to emphasise young Fry\u2019s obses-sion. This short also examines his friendship\nwith the eponymous Bunce, a newly arrived\npupil who helps Fry with his escapades and\nis used to set up a very heart-warming end-ing. Above all, however, the film is hugely\nfunny, especially with Fry\u2019s measured, almost genteel, manner of speech being mocked\nrelentlessly.\nMy favourite short is probably Capturing\nSanta by Chris O\u2019Dowd, best known as Roy\nfrom The IT Crowd. It tells the story of young\nChris\u2019s hatred of Santa Claus, whose \u201cbreakins\u201d of people\u2019s homes O\u2019Dowd calls \u201ccreepy\u201d.\nHis opinion is not helped by never getting the\nChristmas presents that he wants: his relatively\npoor parents using two-for-one offers to buy\nthe same gifts for him and his sisters. Capturing Santa sees him engineering a plan to catch\nSanta using a number of inventive traps set\naround the fireplace and Christmas tree. While,\nfor a moment, it seems that this might degenerate into a Home Alone rip-off it is saved by\nits original humour and the exceptional child\nactors involved.\nNot all of the shorts are autobiographical. In\nhis film Car Park Babylon Bill Bailey plays a\nself-obsessed man on Christmas Eve, avoiding\nhis loved ones to buy himself an expensive new\nmobile phone in a large shopping centre. Unusual forces, however, conspire to prevent him\nbuying his present or even leaving, presumably\nas punishment for his selfish behaviour. There\nare some genuinely eerie moments in this one,\nespecially in the deserted car park, but Bailey\ndoes well to balance this out with his gentle\nbrand of humour.\nMany Little Crackers episodes showcase\nLucy Lumsden\u2019s (Sky One\u2019s Head of Comedy) desire to focus on family and real life\nsituations. She cites Outnumbered, which she\ncommissioned whilst at the BBC, as a source\nof inspiration for Sky One\u2019s new wave of com-edy. Though this works in most cases, some\nfilms do seem to be lacking innovation. Dawn\nFrench\u2019s Operation Big Hat, about the Queen\nMother visiting French\u2019s family when her father was an RAF serviceman, seems too content to simply tell the story. The archive footage of the real life event is interesting and the\nfilm itself is quite pleasant, but it loses out on a\nStephen Fry\u2019s quality Movember contribution\nChannel Sky One, Sky One HD\nProducer Yvonne O\u2019Grady\nCast Stephen Fry, Dawn French, Bill\nBailey, David Baddiel, Julie Davis, Victoria\nWood, Catherine Tate, Meera Syal, Chris\nO\u2019Dowd\nLittle Crackers\nFriday 19 November 2010\nsense of purpose and, in some places, humour.\nThrowing in a subplot about the young Dawn\nbeing afraid of the old Queen Mother after\nhaving been just read the story of Snow White\nand the Seven Dwarves does provide a few\ngood laughs, but not enough to equal the best\nshorts. Kathy Burke\u2019s piece about her meeting\nher favourite band, The Clash, suffers similar\nproblems.\nThere is, however, a lot to enjoy in Little\nCrackers. Other famous names to produce\nfilms include Julia Davis, Victoria Wood,\nCatherine Tate and David Baddiel. Meera\nSyal\u2019s short, which draws on some of her own\nexperiences to create a fictional story of an\nIndian girl who lives in England but whose\nparents don\u2019t celebrate Christmas, will be the\nfirst ever British-scripted program to appear\nin 3D on television \u2013 an impressively ambitious leap.\nThe almost surreal feeling of seeing so many\nof the shorts\u2019 creators appearing alongside\nchild actors portraying their younger selves is\nalso very enjoyable \u2013 the best examples probably being Stephen Fry appearing as his school\nheadmaster, Catherine Tate as her own mother,\nor Dawn French as the Queen Mother. Even the\nslower of these films are highly watchable. In\naddition to the humour and nostalgia, the series\ndraws further strength from its variety. There\nis something here for everyone and I guarantee that you\u2019ll stay riveted until the very end of\nthe last episode. I heartily recommend that you\nwatch Little Crackers over Christmas and keep\nan eye out for more of Sky One\u2019s promising\nnew comedic output.\nMasiej Matuszewski attends the BAFTA preview of Sky\nOne\u2019s latest comedy series of all-star Christmas specials\n\u201c\n\u201c Fren\nFr\nMo\nMo\nther\nther\ntent\nten\nage\nag\nfilm\nIn addition to the\nhumour and nostalgia,\nthe series draws further\nstrength from its variety.\nThere is something here\nfor everyone, I guarantee\nthat you\u2019ll be riveted\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 19 NOVEMBER 2010\n4\nIn brief\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSimon Singh speaks on libel\nsuccess and the road ahead\nOn Monday the 15th, Simon Singh announced that\nhe would deliver a talk at Imperial College. He was\ntalking at the Neonatal Update 2010 seminar taking place at the college for academics from around\nthe world. Dr Singh\u2019s talk was free for all to attend,\nbut sadly poorly promoted to the rest of the college.\nSince his packed-out talk last year, the author of\n\u2018Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem\u2019 has won the libel case that\nhas propelled him from being a brilliant science journalist to a crusader for the reform of Britain\u2019s byzantine and horrendously damaging libel laws and the\nde-facto spokesman for anti-alternative medicine \u2013\nwhile keeping the incredibly cool hair.\nA short history of the case of Singh vs. the British Chiropractic Association highlights all that is\ncurrently wrong with the libel laws in this country.\nFrom the almost worshipful tones that the audience\nphrased their questions to Simon, there was a real\nindication of how much the scientific community appreciates his efforts to tackle the libel laws head\non. After he published an article in The Guardian\nin 2006 criticising chiropractors for offering to treat\ninfant diseases such as colic when there was no\nscientific evidence to support their claims that it\nworked, Singh was personally sued by the BCA for\nlibel. If the fact that a person can be sued for libel\nby simply stating scientific fact makes you angry,\nthe rest of Singh\u2019s talk would leave you blind with\nrage. He outlined how incredibly easy it is to accuse\nsomeone of libel; how even legal victory can lose\nyou well over \u00a3100,000 in legal fees; and worst of\nall, how hard it is to defend yourself in terms of the\nlaw, even when science backs you up.\nA brilliant and entertaining public speaker, Singh\u2019s\nlecture was given with the effortless cool that we\nexpect from the only astrophysics professor to have\nwire-framed round glasses and a meticulous hi-fade, even in photographs of him having acupuncture to the face. Informative and funny, Imperial\u2019s\ncoolest alumnus since HG Wells convinced all and\nsundry present to sign up to his campaign at www.\nlibelreform.org.\nMatt Allinson\nAt the beginning of term, the Rector called for action to\nimprove coursework assessment and marking, so...\nThe start of term saw Imperial announce\na campaign to improve the assessment of\nstudents\u2019 work. Ahead of the end of term\nsurveys, Felix investigates the improvements that have been made. Has the college gone far enough or is there still more\nthat should be done?\nThe National Student Survey showed\nassessment and feedback were lagging\nway behind other areas in college which\notherwise scored exceptionally. The Rector, Keith O\u2019Nions called for \u2018strong and\nconcerted action\u2019and recommended a two\nweek feedback deadline.\nThis deadline is now being implemented in almost every department across\ncollege. If a piece of work takes longer\nto mark, lecturers must justify this to the\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies and inform the students.\nThe only department not implementing\nthe two week deadline is Civil Engineering, whose \u2018timetable did not permit the\nchange\u2019, remarked Alex Dahinten, Deputy President (Education). \u2018They have,\nhowever, reduced the average time to\nreturn feedback to students considerably\nover the past years\u2019. The department itself\nwas not available for comment.\nFrom my own experience in Biology,\nlecturers judge the new rules as fair to students even if they generate added pressure\nfor staff. Steve Cook, Head of first year\nBiology, commented that, \u2018For essays,\nbalancing the requirements for speed and\nconsistency in marking is tricky, but this\nhas always been the case.\u2019 In second year,\none exception to the rule has been permit-ted, a 20+ page bioinformatics project,\nwith one lecturer marking 150 pieces of\nwork. Students are very reasonable and\nunderstand the 3 week turnaround given\nto this project.\nHowever, general consensus among\nstudents across departments is that whilst\ntimeliness of feedback has almost certainly improved this year, the quality of\nfeedback is much the same. The main issue raised by students questioned by Felix\nwas that feedback remained \u2018impersonal\u2019.\n\u2018Quality of marking to me is far more\nimportant that the speed with which we\nget it back. Of course I don\u2019t want it\nback months later as happened in a few\ninstances last year, but a little more one-to-one interaction between lecturer and\nstudent would help tremendously\u2019, commented a second year biology student.\nBut students and staff differ in their criteria of what constitutes good feedback.\nWhilst students call for more detailed\npersonal feedback, many staff readily dismiss its importance.\nFrank Berkshire, director of undergraduate studies in Mathematics, told\nFelix that \u2018Personal feedback is deliberately not aimed to provide a full\nblow-by-blow account of what has gone\nwrong, but to indicate where and how, so\nthat students can find their way through\nto an improvement in performance.\u2019\nPerhaps students also need to broaden\ntheir ideas on what constitutes feedback\nand accept that it comes in a variety of\nforms, an idea suggested by Alex Dahinten, Deputy President (Education).\n\u2018A lecturer discussing the major issues\nin the last coursework is feedback. Red\npen annotations on your lab scripts is\nfeedback. Even verbal conversation\nabout the previous coursework is feedback.\u2019\nStudents take feedback very seriously\nand rightly so. \u2018If College wishes for\nImperial to be \u2018world-class\u2019 in teaching\nand learning, then it needs to be \u2018worldclass\u2019in feedback as well; lecturers have\nan obligation to ensure that the feedback\nstudents receive is of good quality\u2019, said\nAlex Dahinten.\nWhen students put a great deal of\ntime and effort into a piece of work,\nthey expect their marks to be justified,\nwrong-doings explained and methods\nfor improvement highlighted. Late and\npoor quality feedback not only dissatisfies students but prepares them poorly\nfor exams.\nWith tuition fees for international students of over \u00a320,000, and the prospect\nof UK/EU fees being trebled to \u00a39000,\nthere is growing consensus among students that they should still get value\nfor money. Rightly so, students should\nexpect nothing more than exceptional\nstandards in all areas of teaching including feedback.\nDissatisfied students have the right to\nchallenge their department over any issues by approaching their year or departmental reps. The rep system can play a\nvital role in seeking out those members\nof staff whose feedback does not live up\nto the standards students expect.\nImproving student satisfaction with\nassessment and feedback is going to be\nno easy task. Positive steps have certainly been made this term by strict implementation of deadlines and students\nshould recognise that. But they should\nalso not be afraid to speak out and voice\ntheir concerns over departments and\nstaff neglecting their obligation to provide decent feedback.\nPerhaps a significant shift in mind-set\nof students is also required of students.\nWe must forget the days of being spoon-fed in school and accept the different\nnature of university feedback. It is our\nresponsibility to pave our own way for-ward.\nHas feedback improved?\nSophia David\nPhoto by Slobodan Radosavljevic\nLook at her waste away her degree on Facebook.

(The company is based in the very exotic\nlocation of Fulham.)\nBefore my internship in India three years\nago, I thought that\u2019s all there was to cur-ry. Then, while visiting Delhi\u2019s legendary\nKarim\u2019s restaurant, my friend, Sajid, corrected my mistaken beliefs: \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between spicy and hot. Spicy means\nflavour, hot means chilli,\u201d he explained. Sure,\nthe Indians do love their chilli with just about\neverything. After months of encountering the\nfiery ingredient in seemingly safe foods like\npizza, sandwiches and burgers, I eventually\nmanaged to get past the overwhelming sensation of burning and learnt to appreciate the\nsubtle underlying differences in taste brought\non by the myriad of different spices used on\nthe Indian subcontinent: turmeric, cumin, fen-Lucie Jichova\u2019s internship in India allowed her to escape British curry houses and sample real Indian food (Photo by Lucie Jichova)\nChicken korma, cobra beer and Slumdog \u2013 made in U.K.\nugreek, coriander, mustard seeds, cardamom,\ncloves, cinnamon, pepper, fennel, asafoetida,\nmango powder, white poppy seeds, star anise\nand more.

The\nHousemaid, a taut, intricately-plotted\nerotic thriller, is the perfect example of\na suspenseful rollercoaster ride that creates its thrills with a central plot full of\ntwists, outstanding performances, sharp\ndialogue, evocative cinematography\nand, quiet but sensual atmosphere.\nEun-yi (Do-yeon Jeon) is a sweet,\ninnocent and vulnerable woman who\nmoves into the home of an incredibly\nwealthy, upper class family to work as\ntheir housemaid. As soon as she enters their marble-floored mansion, she\nrealises that they are living in a whole\nanother universe. Expensive bottles of\nwine and selection of cheeses are their\nmidnight snack, their wardrobes are a\nsight to behold and they listen to classical music on their lavish, state-of-the-art stereo. Their extravagance goes on\nand on. Her bosses are Hoon (Jung-jae\nLee) and his heavily pregnant young\nwife Haera (Woo Seo). Eun-yi also has\na mentor in the know-it-all, cold-faced\nByung-sik (Yeo-jong Yun), a prying old\nlady who has been serving the family for\nyears.\nPerhaps it\u2019s because his sex life with\nhis pregnant wife is proving to be too\nchallenging and unfulfilling, Eun-yi is\nlured into an affair with her boss. One\nsteamy and noisy night attracts the attention of Byung-sik and this of course\nleads to complications, which draw the\nwomen surrounding the handsome, narcissistic boss into a game of power play.\nHaera is furious with her husband\nand wants revenge, but her chilling,\nmanipulative mother (Ji-yeong Park) is\nmore interested in how much Hoon has\nto offer. Haera needs to stay married to\nhim, not just for money, but for power,\nand so should look the other way. It\u2019s a\nwoman\u2019s duty, the scary lady explains.\nFor these rich people, money is the answer to everything. Haera\u2019s mother tries\nto pay Eun-yi off with quite a sum, but\nthe pure-hearted girl cannot accept.\nByung-sik is the one caught in the mid-dle, and although she sympathises with\nEun-yi, she cannot do anything to help\nher. It doesn\u2019t matter that Byung-sik\nhas a long-standing connection with the\nfamily: she is the servant and dares not\nto speak out against her employers. As\nHaera and her mother\u2019s methods of trying to get rid of Eun-yi turn more and\nmore violent, Byung-sik can only stand\naside and watch with pain and guilt, as\nDirector Sang-soo Im\nScreenwriter Sang-soo Im, Kiyoung Kim\nCast Do-yeon Jeon, Jung-Jae Lee,\nSeo-Hyeon Ahn\nThe Housemaid\nJohn Park\nDirector Jorge Michel Grau\nScreenwriter Jorge Michel Grau\nCast Adri\u00e1n Aguirre, Miriam\nBalderas, Francisco Barreiro\nWe Are What We Are\nJake Lea-Wilson\nIn 2004 I was travelling in Australia\nwhen someone dared me to go to the\ncinema. The idea was to go to see Super Size Me, the Morgan Spurlock docu-mentary, whilst eating two super-sized\nMcDonald\u2019s Big Mac meals. I succeeded in the challenge although it put\nme off McDonald\u2019s for the duration of\nuniversity. I extend that dare to anyone,\nanywhere, to eat anything even remotely\nmeaty whilst watching the new Mexican\nhorror film based on a family of canni-bals, We Are What We Are.\nThe film starts off with an old dying\nman in a mall, gazing open-mouthed at\nsome partially naked mannequins.

Shocking as it is the film will eventually have\nyou rooting for Alfredo to catch his first\nvictim, whether that be a whore (like his\nfather\u2019s tactics) or a homosexual, who\nAlfredo finds much easier to seduce before dinner.\nThe real genius of the film, however, is\nnot in the raw flesh and shock-goretastic\nviolence, like most of the horror films\nout this time of year, but it\u2019s in the questions posed by the narrative. As you\u2019re\nwatching, you slowly begin to learn\nwhy someone would be eating someone\nelse in the first place. It\u2019s pretty slow\nmoving but that gives you time to ask\nShe\u2019s not looking forwards to getting those stains out...\nCannibals and modern family dysfunction\nSouth Korea\u2019s sharp, suspenseful thriller\nEun-yi\u2019s well-being is threatened.\nThe lavish set-design of the marvelous\nmansion, as well as the graceful cinematography that further amplifies the delicate and beautiful home further adds to\nthe tension. This is one fragile house,\ngleaming with perfection. Quite often,\nit\u2019s too perfect, and many dark secrets\nare hiding behind the perfectly hung\npictures, chandeliers and expensive fur-niture. When there is so much passion,\njealousy, lust, anger and devious back-stabbing, the house won\u2019t be able to take\nit for long.\nBut it is the truly outstanding actresses\nthat dominate the screen and portray\ntheir complex emotions exceptionally\nwell. Jeon is fascinating in the central\nrole, her doe-eyed, gentle nature remaining uncorrupted by the evil around her.\nShe does get in the middle of a marriage,\nbut never in the vindictive sense. Even\nwhen the affair is stopped abruptly,\nEun-yi is not at all angry, just slightly\nconfused as she goes back to her work,\ncarrying on with her life as normally as\npossible. Jeon is utterly convincing as\nthe victim, and as her character goes\nthrough major changes, everything that\nshe portrays \u2013 ranging from vulnerabil-ity, to sexy, seductive energy to vengeful fury \u2013 is impeccable. Rich supporting roles are also anchored by the three\nterrific actresses (Yun, Park and Seo).\nThe one who stands out is Yun, whose\ninitial bitter personality is simply a cunning mask for surviving under the rich,\npretentious family whom she secretly\nresents. Park\u2019s blunt words spoken in\nsuch self-righteous tones rounds off the\nexcellent cast.\nComplicated twists and exciting revelations keep this film going and the\nbuild-up to the melodramatic finale is\nundeniably gripping. The ending will\nnot satisfy everyone, since there is no\nmurderous, bloody rampage that gives\nthe feeling of fulfillment of revenge, but\nas far as Eun-yi\u2019s character goes, what\nshe does makes perfect sense. The subtle twists in camera angles, uncomfortable shades of dark colours and intense\nlooks from the characters don\u2019t cost a\nlot of money, but are certainly more than\nenough to get the pulses racing.\nyourself plenty of questions like \u201ccan I\never eat meat again?\u201d or \u201cwhy does the\nfamily have 500 clocks in their living\nroom?\u201d Although you don\u2019t actually see\nany human-sandwiches being consumed\nwe do get treated to the visible and audible feast of \u201cthe ritual\u201d. I can tell you\nnow that the Foley artists would have\nhad a great day when they got to make\nthese sound effects.\nHeralded as a social satire, the film\nexamines many issues in Mexico and\nworldwide. It touches upon corrup-tion, poverty, violence and centres on\nmodern day family dysfunction. Using\nfood, albeit people food, is an interesting way to highlight these points. (Isn\u2019t\nour government always saying we don\u2019t\neat enough meals as a family?) This is\none film that is definitely worth a view-ing, though watch out for the daughter\nin the family. Don\u2019t be fooled by her\nlooks and sense of family loyalty, she\u2019s\nhiding a nasty homosapien hunger under\nher cute white dress.\nSuspicious-looking lamps are only the beginning of her problems\n\n"

But even then\nI noted that at least it would offer a\nconvenient way of sorting you all into\ngroups that could be easily avoided.\nTo be honest, my feelings about Facebook have evolved around that point,\nthe idea that you\u2019re all now happily\npigeonholed and I can observe you,\nclipboard in hand, and pre-arrange any\navoidances and meetings.\nEarlier this month, some angry people\nburnt some red paper poppies and got\nonto the news. \u201cOh dear me,\u201d I thought,\nas I sipped my pureed copy of that day\u2019s\nSun newspaper prepared for me by Mrs.\nGeek, \u201cIt appears that some angry people have done something inflammatory\non these darling, Christian shores.\u201d In\na world without Facebook, a magical\nworld where farming is still a job, that\nis the end of the matter. At any time, I\ncould bump into someone and discover\ntheir opinion on that news story. The\nlittle opinion-laden buggers are every-where, lying in wait with their reckonings and thoughts.\nDespicable, isn\u2019t it? So I\u2019m thankful\nthat Facebook is here. I simply put down\nmy mug, saunter over to the computer,\nand begin taking notes on people\u2019s re-sponses. Linda thinks they should \u201cfuk\nbak off to their own country\u201d. Thanks for\nsharing, Linda. I\u2019ll make sure I take your\nnut allergy into account when choosing\nyour Christmas present, then. Chris has\nliked Linda\u2019s post. Nice to know, Chris.\nThat mouse click really carried a lot of\ngravitas. You\u2019ve earned yourself a oneway ticket to the Card And A Smile list,\ndeparting from Small Gift And A Man\nHug list immediately.\nSee? It\u2019s easy. You just get a pen and\npaper, scroll through your Facebook\nhome page, and make two lists. Twat-y\nand Nice. Would and Would Not Piss\nOn If On Fire. And it\u2019s not being vin-dictive, it\u2019s genuinely helpful. You\u2019re\npicking people you like based on the\nopinions they\u2019re willing to express\nonline.\nAlright, it\u2019s a bit vindictive.\nI\u2019m sticking by it simply because it\nnever ceases to wheedle out the particularly covert nutcases. The old schoolteacher who thinks that homosexuals\nbasically should be second-class citi-zens. The young art student you used to\nknow who believes America is being run\nby communists. Oh, hey! Your neighbours are complaining about students\nwho smell and suck the country dry of\nmoney. That\u2019ll be you they mean.\nIt\u2019s depressing, sure. Of course it\u2019s\ndepressing. Because the further you go\nthrough those news feeds, particularly\nthose of your younger siblings and their\nfriends, the more you realise not only\nthat most of the people you know are\ndicks, but that the useful 1950s habit of\nkeeping the crazy tightly nailed down\nunder a saucepan somewhere at home\nhas fallen out of fashion. People love\nthis shit!\nFacebook used to just be a terrifying\nwaste of time. Then it became a magical place where you could see the words\n\u201cOccupation: Judge\u201d and \u201cFukin ell the\nppl at work were shit 2day\u201d in the same\nweb page. Now it\u2019s just this morass of\npersonal confessions and unwanted,\nAntisocial Network\ntoo-much-information diatribes. We like\nthis. They like this. We think this.\nAs an Englishman, I just feel it was\nbetter when we refrained from discussing politics, religion or Justin Bieber\non public transport and in court. I wish\nthere was some way to retrofit more\nrepression of emotion into our society,\nto bottle things up a bit more and fight\nback any kind of release. How are we\nsupposed to get things done otherwise,\neh?\nBut as I say, that\u2019s not the world I\u2019ve\ngot. Instead I\u2019ve got a world where my\nbrother can lead a silent online revolution merely by stating that Justin Bieber\nis dumb and getting fourteen people to\nagree with him. You\u2019ll forgive me, then,\nfor indulging in the small mercy that I\ncan at least write down the names of\nthose fourteen people and append them\nto the end of the already arm-length gallows waiting list. Be warned, reader.\nThe streets of the internet are no longer\nsafe. A Geek is watching you.\nGot an opinion? See if I give a shit\nat anangrygeek@googlemail.com.\nFacebook is a great opportunity for me to extend my\nhitlist without having to leave the comfort of my room\nSo the Union\u2019s \u00a32.5 million refurbishment\nis finally coming to a close. The horrendous\nblue shed outside Metric will disappear and\nsmoking builders in high-vis jackets will no\nlonger grace Beit Quad. Even the decrepit\nlawn is being renewed. But as memories of\nasbestos grow faint in our minds and the\nconstant thud and screech of construction\nwork fades into the air, what will we think of\nour new Union?\nIn the past students have had good reason to complain. Queues in what is now\nFiveSixEight were unmanageable on busy\nnights and the decor gave little reason for\neither students or bar staff to respect and\nenjoy their bar. The club that came before\nMetric (we shall not speak its name) was\nbeyond salvation. It was a muddled mess\nand frankly an embarrassment. And that\u2019s\nbefore we get on to the service provided\nin these venues. Suffice it to say that the\nfood in FiveSixEight is much improved and\nthat the emphasis on live music in Metric\nshows that the Union is at last listening to\nits students.\nThe real test now, is less of the Union and\nits ability to deliver but more on the Imperial student. We shall now see whether it\nis actually possible to please your average\nImperial student. Is there a way to satisfy\nhis or her demands or will we be doomed to\nan eternity of: \u201cIt\u2019s still not good enough?\u201d\nOn balance, most students with any experience of other student unions in London\nwill recognize that they now own something\ntruly special. In fact, most students with experience of other bars and clubs in London\nwill recognize that the new Union is pretty\ndamn good.\nBut a few will continue to moan that the\nUnion is lame, or full of guys, or some\nother intellectually lazy gripe. They will try\nto perpetuate the myth that Imperial is a\nplace where it\u2019s impossible to enjoy music\nand art and where the chance of finding\nlove or adventure is virtually nil. It\u2019s time\nto say \u2018enough\u2019 to those people. We cannot expect to have life handed to us on a\nplate, we must grab all the opportunities\nwe encounter with both hands. And with the\nnumber of clubs and societies at Imperial,\nthe overflowing excitement of London and\nthe new Union bar and club, it\u2019s time to quit\nmoaning. The question \u201cWhy would anyone\nfrom UCL want to come to Imperial to hang\nout?\u201d is redundant. It should now be, \u201cWhy\nwould anyone from Imperial want to go hang\nout at UCL?\u201d\nFELIX\nAngry Geek\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nThe Union has done all\nit can.If you\u2019re still not\nhaving fun,perhaps it\u2019s\ntime to look inward\nWhat happens on Facebook doesn\u2019t stay on Facebook. It is used by me as comedy material\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cThe little opinion-laden buggers are\neverywhere\u201d\nnd\nnd\nok\nk\n-y\n\u201c\n\u201c\n\u201c\nay on Facebook.

If we stopped wasting this food,\nthe reduction in U.K. carbon emissions would\nbe equivalent to taking 1 in 5 cars off the road.\nAccording to FoodCycle, an estimated 400,000\ntonnes of surplus food can be reclaimed each\nyear from the food retailer industry to be made\ninto healthy and nutritious meals.\nFoodCycle tackles food waste and malnutrition in disadvantaged communities at the same\ntime by empowering local communities to\nset up groups of volunteers to collect surplus\nproduce locally and prepare nutritious meals\nin unused professional kitchen spaces. These\nmeals are then served to those in need in the\ncommunity.\nTo get involved in the Imperial branch of this\ninitiative, email foodcycle@imperial.ac.uk\nWalk \u2013 it sounds simple, but taking time out\nof your day to walk, rather than bus/train it,\nisn\u2019t just good for the planet, it\u2019s good for your\nhealth and your wallet.\nGo meat free for a day \u2013 like our VegSoc\nPresident says, going meat free for a day can\nreduce your carbon footprint without the health\nhomework of going fully veggie .\nBuy a reusable bottle \u2013 there are tons on the\nmarket now, from reusable plastic to steel, so\nditch the bottled water habit.\nStock up on reusable bags \u2013 if you\u2019re short\non space, get handy ones that fold up, eg.

Most packaged fruit and veg has\nthe country of origin on it. Buy locally to\nreduce your food miles \u2013 try local farmer\u2019s\nmarkets for a better range. When buying\neggs, meat and fish look out for labels saying\n\u2018Free Range\u2019 or that animal welfare standards\nare adhered to. With fish, look for a Marine\nStewardship Council logo which shows that\nthe fish has been sourced sustainably.

Give your junk to charity\nshops, freecycle or eBay it \u2013 make sure that\nanything that can be reused finds a loving home\ninstead of going to landfill.\nCharity shops \u2013 Go to charity shops the next\ntime you want clothes, a book or some music\n\u2013 you\u2019re recycling and giving to charity.

Or\nsome travelling planned ahead of the next break?\nJoin the discussion #FelixTravel on twitter for ideas.\nI\nrony simply cannot be expressed in a\nbetter way: I was attempting to explain\nthe concept of budget travelling to a PR\nguy representing Dubai Tourism.\nIn the previous week I was strolling\nthrough the aisles of stands at the World Travel\nMarket, a prominent travel expo which annually lures advertisers and clients alike to The\nDocklands, when the stark contrast of grandeur\nsmacked me in the gob.\nWhereas its neighbouring exhibitors squatted in booths drowning in brochures and give-aways, the United Arab Emirates had installed\na double-decker compound, an area dominating\nthe space equivalent to twenty of its counter-parts, completed with furnishings and artefacts and manned by cohorts of flamboyantly-dressed advertising experts.\nAnd I shall not forget to mention Emirates,\nUAE\u2019s national airline, whose presence at the\nexpo consisted of a separate gigantic edifice.\nWhilst ebbing closer to their star attraction\n\u2013 showcase of their latest onboard first-class\n\u201cBudget travellers do not\ntravel for the purpose of\nshunning companionship\nand social opportunities\n\u2013 they embrace them\u201d\nWhat really is budget travelling? Dylan Lowe discovers\nmore to it than counting pennies and baked-bean meals\ntels are sought after not solely for the cheap\naccommodation they provide; rather, their\nhosting of like-minded people, budget travellers and backpackers alike, and allowing them\nto congregate and mingle freely within their\npremises, appeals.\nAnd whilst luxury-seeking holidaymakers\nhave a great demand for seclusion, the budget\ntravellers tends to have a more casual need for\nprivacy \u2013 they compromise it by willingly stay\nin shared dormitories, for example. Many of\nthem do not travel for the purpose of shunning\ncompanionship and social opportunities \u2013 they\nembrace them.\nThe sharing of local knowledge also brings\ntogether budget travellers with the veterans\npassing on recommendations to newcomers,\nwho will in-turn transfer them to those who\nhave more recently arrived at the scene.\nWhich makes hostels effective advertising\nmediums \u2013 a word-of-mouth promotion vehicle\nthat propels itself.\nThe significance of travelling as a learning\n\u201cIn countries where the\nlucrative, legitimate\nscamming of tourists\nreigns supreme, locals\nare used to handling with\npseudo-fact finders and\ndismissing them with\ncondescension\u201d\nseats \u2013 the glamour could only repeatedly\nprompt the same question in my mind: will I\never be able to afford this?\nI backed off and swore the oath to never contemplate committing such financial atrocity\nlittle knowing that, in a week\u2019s time, I would\nreceive an invitation to lunch with representatives of Dubai Tourism.\nOver mint tea, I steered the conversation towards a field I could self-proclaim to be a specialist of \u2013 student travelling.\nReassurance was made to me that a form of\ntourism merciful to the visitors\u2019 wallet does\nexist in Dubai. Four-plus-starred hotels \u2013 mentions of three-stars or lesser rankers were virtually inexistent \u2013 designer-Barbie-doll shopping\nand snazzy wagons aside, there are apparently\nplenty of budget-friendly options and opportu-nities.\nI had to remind him that he was, in a way,\nmissing the point.\nOne dimensional as the etymology of the\nphrase \u2018budget travelling\u2019 may be, its notion\nand, indeed, its philosophy are a lot more complex than mere financial considerations.\nFundamentally it is a culture \u2013 one that bonds\ntogether budget travellers with the notion of\nmaximising their travel experience through\nminimal spending.\nTake the hostelling culture for instance. HosEspecially in countries where the lucrative,\nlegitimate scamming of tourists reigns su-preme, locals are used to handling pseudo-fact\nfinders and dismissing them with condescen-sion. Travellers \u2013 and myself most certainly \u2013\nfind it frustrating to not be treated with respect\nand helpfulness when being genuinely inquisi-tive.\nIn a way I was glad to have come away from\nthe event with better understanding of tourism\nin Dubai \u2013 for a country largely enshrouded by\nsecrecy and negative press, the United Arab\nEmirates has been regarded by many budget\ntravellers as unapproachable.\nWhen the culture of budget travelling is\nfirmly cemented to the UAE\u2019s tourism industry,\nwhen its attention on money-splashing hoteliers and tight-pocketed traveller reaches equi-librium, when budget travellers begin to perceive it less as a millionaires\u2019 playground and\ncongregate, perhaps its appeal as a destination\nfit for mere mortals may seize our hearts and\nunleash hordes of backpackers onto the streets\nin a scale akin to that in Bangkok. But until\nthen, despite its publicity efforts, reluctance is\nwhat it will receive from the budget traveller.\nCan you refuse to help two hot blondes?\nprocess, to many of its wandering advocates,\nbrings about a whole new level of curiosity \u2013\nwhere travellers lack the financial means they\ncompensate with doubled eagerness to absorb\nknowledge on local cultures, customs, etc.\n\n"

In\nMarch the motoring clique feverishly anticipated the return of the seven-times world\nchampion Michael Schumacher. Arguably the\nbest driver in the history of the sport was making an epic comeback, driving the car that was\noriginally intended for the then current world\nchampion Jenson Button. But the enticing combination did not work. What could have been\nthe fastest driver in the fastest car turned out\nto be a disappointingly mediocre mix, lingering\nfar behind the pace of Red Bull, Ferrari, and\nMcLaren. The legendary German just did not\nknow when to pack it in \u2013 Take That, take note.\nThat Sebastian Vettel, also known as \u201cBaby\nSchuey\u201d, took the 2010 crown on the weekend only serves to underline how the sport has\nmoved on from the days when the season results read: Australia: Schumacher 1st, Brazil:\nSchumacher 1st, Malaysia: Schumacher 1st\u2026\nwell, you get the gist. Or has it?\nBack in 2002, Ferrari manipulated the Austrian GP by ordering Rubens Barrichello to\nallow Schumacher, his teammate, to overtake\nEventual 2010 World Champion, Sebastian Vettel making his way around the spectacular Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi\nand win the race. The farce led to a ban on\nteam orders, that did not stop Ferrari repeating the same trick this year, when in Germany they asked Felipe Massa to let Fernando\nAlonso through. This was a direct breach of\nthe sport\u2019s regulations: article 39.1 states that\n\u201cteam orders which interfere with a race result are prohibited\u201d. Article 151.c reads \u201cany\nfraudulent conduct or any act prejudicial to the\ninterests of any competition, or to the interests\nof motorsport generally\u201d can be punished. Yet\nFerrari got away with a slap on the wrist and\na paltry (in F1 terms) fine of $100,000. That\nJean Todt, the president of the FIA, claimed\nthere was not enough evidence to convict the\nprancing horse was a complete kick in the\nteeth to all F1 fans who believe in racing. Sadly, Ferrari are still very much the darlings of\nthe FIA. It should be a PR relief to Ecclestone\nand Todt that Alonso did not win this year\u2019s\nchampionship \u2013 far from being a gallant prancing horse, the Spaniard would have resembled\na Machiavellian limping donkey. It is certainly\npoetic justice.\nThe other unpleasant boil on the face of F1\nis the teams that make up the back of the grid.\nAgain in 2002, Minardi were the comedians of\nF1, qualifying over four seconds off the pole\nsitter. Imagine a 100 metres race between Usain Bolt and a Zimmer frame yielding granny.\nMinardi have since disappeared from the sport,\nthough another three verrucas materialised in\ntheir place: Virgin, Hispania, and Lotus Racing. The latter has nothing in common with\nthe legendary team of the 1970s other than\nthe name. These teams are to racing what Ann\nWiddecombe is to dancing. Virgin were not\neven capable of designing cars with the right\nsize fuel tank to get to the end of races! What\nshould we read into Richard Branson\u2019s recent\ndisinvestment of his shareholding in the team?\nIs F1 not supposed to be the pinnacle of mo-torsport?\nLet us not detract from the wonders the 2010\nseason had to offer. It was as exciting as Angelina Jolie\u2019s bottom - five drivers were in contention for the championship right up until the\nlast races. Vettel had not lead the championship\nthis season until the moment it mattered most;\nat the chequered flag on Sunday. Next year, five\nworld champions will be in the hunt \u2013 Miss Jolie\u2019s posterior has some serious competition.\nPedal to the Vettel\nRugby slump to first defeat\nAny hopes that the Imperial College 1st XV\nhad of remaining unbeaten in the league this\nseason were quashed on Wednesday. They\nwere on the receiving end of a 39-13 drubbing\nat the hands of Reading on an overcast and\ncold afternoon.\nImperial had gone into the game knowing\nthat it was the most important of their season\nso far; Imperial and Reading both stood at the\nsummit of the league with both teams unbeat-en. As only one team gains promotion a victory\nwould have put Imperial above their closest rivals and in pole position to achieve their goal.\nThroughout the warm up Imperial had looked\nsharp and focused; team moves looked slick\nand precise. A solitary penalty was Imperial\u2019s\nonly contribution to the first half score line;\nReading had scored two penalties and a converted try. Their lead was minimal and had\nbeen gifted to them through Imperials own\nmistakes and inability to convert their hard\nwork and endeavour into points.\nImperial hit back in the second half with a\ntry finished by the forwards rumbling over the\ntry line.\nThe very next play resulted in a Reading\nscore from an interception pass. Further tries\nwere added from slopping play by Imperial resulting in a score line which not only flattered\ntheir hosts but gave them an impressive points\ndifference which may be influential in a promotion decider.\nThe game and the manner in which it was\nlost will hopefully serve as a wake up call to a\ntalented squad who now realise that they cannot expect to be gifted results; they have to be\nearned.\nDavid Wilson\nCharles Betts\n\n"

For\nthose who dare to recall dB\u2019s, it\nwas a pretty terrible setup, far\nfrom ideal for playing gigs. We\nshould now have ourselves a\nswag gigging venue, and that\u2019s\ngreat news for everyone from\nJazz n\u2019 Rock, to Music Tech Soc,\nto KnitSoc. Hopefully the opening of Metric will usher in a new\nera of Imperial home brew activity with many a live night ahead\nof us.

Obviously there\nwill always be the need to cater\nto as wide a taste as possible.\nBut when you\u2019ve spend gazillions\non a sweet-ass live music venue,\nyou want to do it justice with\nsome sweet-ass live music.\nFELIX Friday 19 NOVEMBER 2010 3\nMetric finally set to open\nNEWS\nAfter almost two months of delays, the new club opens its doors to students\nAfter almost two months of waiting, the\nUnion\u2019s new club, Metric, is set to open\ntriumphantly on Saturday 20th November. The launch marks the end of \u2018Phase\n3\u2019 of the \u00a32.5 million Union redevelop-ment, which included the refurbishment\nof the old Da Vinci\u2019s bar, now FiveSixEight, and a scrub up of the Union Bar.\nThe refurbishment, which began at the\nbeginning of the summer, has been beset with problems relating to the age of\nthe building, including the discovery of\nasbestos a month ago. In addition the removal of a central pillar in Metric, which\nthreatened to jeopardise the clubs\u2019 ability to act as a live music venue, proved\nto be a greater construction challenge\nthan thought. As a Union spokesperson\nput it, \u201cthe club would have opened for\nWelcome Week if it weren\u2019t for the pillar\u201d. The original opening date of the\n2nd of October was first moved back to\nthe 29th, but the discovery of asbestos\nmeant it was pushed back again to the\n20th of November.\nThe event is almost guaranteed to be a\nsell-out.

The tracks range\nfrom dull, generic folk-pop, to cheap\ncopies of other, better artists, \u2018I Saw\nYou Walk Away\u2019, could be a Morrissey\nfiller track. Aside from the obligatory\nacoustic guitar, the instrumentation is\ntruly bizarre, including repeated use of\na drum machine that adds nothing. Lyrically this is crammed full of clich\u00e9s and\nvague, meaningless phrases. This album\nis only the first in a series of three, I\nhope for his sake that the next two are a\nlot better. Stephen Smith\nBadly Drawn Boy\nThe pink lighting was the key ingredient to the success of the flamingo impression\nA\ns an Imperial student,\nthe Royal Albert Hall\ncan easily become a\nmundane and constant\nfeature of our university\nlives. It\u2019s by no means an ugly building\nbut, after almost three and half years\nat Imperial, I scarcely give it a cursory\nglance. Last Sunday, after experiencing The Cinematic Orchestra perform\nwithin its circled walls, I found a renewed appreciation for our illustrious\nneighbour.\nThe Cinematic Orchestra last performed at the Royal Albert Hall in 2007\nand the night had the air of a triumphant\nreturn (an extremely cold triumphant return but triumphant nonetheless). They\nwere as impressive as I expected, but\nbefore they took to the stage, we had a\ncouple of delicious appetizers.\nThe London Metropolitan Orchestra opened and, from my seat in Choir\nbehind the stage, for the first time I understood the complexity and skill of the\norchestra and the conductor. Strangely\nenough, I think because I was there of\nmy accord (instead of being coerced\nby my keen-to-be-cultured parents) I\nwas more open-minded about the classical music and more able to enjoy it.\nAlthough trying to explain to the stew-ard, as I waited to return to my seat after\nusing the bathroom, that there were two\nseparate \u2018orchestras\u2019 performing that\nnight but only one was an actual orches-Cinematic Orchestra\nIt\u2019s What I\u2019m Thinking\n(Part 1 Photographing\nSnowflakes\nPeartree Records\n\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\u2729\nThe side-project of Placebo drummer\nSteve Hewitt, this single is heavily led\nby the distorted, bassy misery-rock of\nhis day-job band, although it\u2019s much\nmore direct and a significantly less fey\naffair than you\u2019d expect from Molko\net al. The effects are straight out of\nthe 80\u2019s synth-rock box, which may\nor may not be your cup of tea, but the\ntrack suffers as it can\u2019t decide what it\nwants to be. It veers between aiming\nfor a claustrophobic, uncomfortable\nDeftones-esque sound and an indie club\njump-along rock track and as a result,\ndoes neither quite convincingly.\nDuncan Casey\nLove Amongst Ruin\nHome\nUniversal\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nThis week\u2019s prize for the worst abuses\nof auto-tune go to Skandal, who apparently hasn\u2019t learned the lessons of Li\u2019l\nWayne\u2019s recent crap rock album \u2013 and\nsubsequent jail term. Still, the South\nLondon rapper has an ear for a beat, and\nwith the addition of a singer that didn\u2019t\nsound like a voice-mail message recorded in a bucket, there\u2019d be a decent tune\nhere. He can rap, even if his rhymes\nare a little suspect every now and again:\nI\u2019ve never heard an enemy described as\nbeing \u201clike a bendy bus\u201d before, but I\nsuppose you\u2019ve got to work with what\nyou\u2019ve got.\nDuncan Casey\nSkandal\nGo\nHalal Beats/Kilamanjaro\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nAnother hazy dream pop band from Baltimore that are well worth your attention\nare Lower Dens, playing with fellow\nBaltimoreans Beach House this week.\nTheir debut record released on singer-songwriter and visual artist; Devendra\nBanhart\u2019s label. \u2018Gnomonsong\u2019 is raw\nand lo fi, but after a couple of listens\nthrough the shoegaze emerges some addictive melodies. Sometime the album\nis victim of its own downtempo pace\nand feels at times uncohesive, however\nit is clear that this band do have poten-tial, their sound just needs to become a\nlittle more focused.\nChristopher Walmsey\nLower Dens\nTwin Hand Movement\nGnomonsong\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nWhen two things of immense beauty combine, strange things can\nhappen.

I\u2019m rather embarrassed to admit\nthat, for me, his music was slightly\novershadowed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra\u2019s performance.\nCompared with the rich, multi-layered\nclassical melodies, his somewhat flat\npost-rock didn\u2019t play my ears with\nquite the same dexterity. Although\nthings turned for the better when he\nmoved to scat jazz his drummer unfortunately stole his thunder with his frenzied bebopping.\nThen finally, the main course.

Producing lustful\nand haunting blues-folk, their sound is\nat its best when it adds a touch of Americana to the classic English setting.\nThe lazy slide guitar stomp of \u2018Strange\nMoon Rising\u2019 conjures images of New\nOrleans swamps, and the distorted blues\nguitar at the end of \u2018Summer Fades\u2019\nhelps elevate the track about the rest of\nthe album. The songs merge together so\nwell that it\u2019s over just as soon as it\u2019s be-gun, fleeting but in a good way.\n-Christopher Dean\nIf you want to share a\nmind-blowing playlist send\nit in to music.felix@gmail.\ncom\nto convey (impossible actually) the effect of The Cinematic Orchestra\u2019s\nwistful music in the splendour of the\nRoyal Albert Hall.

The\nvocals fizzed with emotion and when\n\u2018To Build A Home\u2019 was performed at the\nend of the set, there was nothing to do\nbut close my eyes and self-indulge in\ntearful nostalgia.\nAs I left the Royal Albert Hall, I\nlooked back and realized even more\nstrongly, that although creative expression is subjective, there are some things\nthat are brilliant and no rational person\ncould disagree .

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 19 NOVEMBER 2010\n8\nStudent success\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial iGem team win in U.S.\nA team of 10 Imperial undergraduates presented a\nresearch project at MIT last week and took away an\nimpressive number of awards. The field was synthetic biolog-y; a groundbreaking approach to designing\nbiological systems using engineering practices.\nThere was some stiff competition between the 130\nteams taking part from all over the world, with each\nproject showing the incredible potential of this revolutionary field. From yeast designed to terraform\nMars, to using E. coli as a form of data storage,\nevery idea was both inspiring and original.\nThe Imperial project focused on a detection kit\nfor the waterborne parasite Schistosoma, which\ncauses schistosomiasis (bilharzia). This neglected\ntropical disease infects 200 million people around\nthe world, and is found in developing countries\nwhere sanitation is inadequate. In addition to discussing the biological processes involved, the team\ncontextualised the project by considering how the\ndetection kit would be implemented in the field. An\napplication has actually been put forward to the Bill\n& Melinda Gates Foundation, with the hope that the\nresearch may one day become a reality.\nThe team also ran a series of school workshops\naround London, explaining the concept of synthetic\nbiology to A-level students. They were encouraged to\ncome up with their own ideas for new synthetic biology applications, and then act out TV adverts to explore exactly how they would bring these products to\nmarket. The team hopes to continue this as a wider\npublic engagement program around the UK in partnership with other iGEM teams. Like many emerging fields, synthetic biology raises many ethical, social and legal questions. Addressing them requires\nscientists to fully understand and engage with the\nwider public, something that needs to improve in the\nfuture for people to find new technologies like synthetic biology socially acceptable.\nContinuing Imperial\u2019s amazingly successful string\nof projects at iGEM, the team won awards for Best\nWebsite, Best Human Practices Advance and the\npeer-reviewed iGEMers Award, as well as reaching the final 6 of the competition. This meant they\nhad to present the project to over 1500 people, an\nexperience most of them would like to forget. But\ndon\u2019t let that put you off! If you think iGEM might be\nfor you, check out their website at 2010.igem.org/\nTeam:Imperial_College_London.\nWhat\u2019s so unique about the iGEM competition is\nthe fact that it\u2019s the students who come up with\nthe ideas and actually put them into practise, something very few undergraduates have the opportunity\nto experience at university. So make sure you get\ninvolved in next year\u2019s team!\nBenjamin Miller and Harriet Gliddon\nActivists plan Lib\nDem HQ occupation\nThe dust has barely settled from the thousands\nof students who descended on London last\nweek to demonstrate against the planned rise of\ntuition fees, but plans are already being set in\nmotion across the country for further protests.\nWednesday 24th November has been proposed\nby several anti-cuts groups as the next significant occasion to bring the issue to the forefront\nof both the political and public mindset.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, following the media\nstorm produced by a minority of anarchic pro-testers, further aggressive action is being organized by radical groups, with the intention of\nthe next protest to focus on attacking the Liberal Democrats rather than the Conservatives\nwith the aim to have the same result at both the\nLiberal Democrat headquarters in Westminster\nand Downing Street as they did at Millbank\nTower.\nThe N.U.S. have not collaborated with plans\nfor next week\u2019s events. N.U.S. President Aaron\nPorter said: \u201cwe won\u2019t condemn non-violent\ndirect action where students support it, but I\nalso won\u2019t organise activities that will have no\nimpact, that rob us of influence and public sup-port, or that claim criminal damage is somehow\n\u2018legitimate violence\u2019.\u201d The N.U.S. has instead\nlaunched a new scheme, calling on students to\nvote against their MPs should they renege on\ntheir pre-election pledge to oppose any raise in\nfees. Aaron Porter has admitted that the new\nscheme is particularly targeted against Liberal\nDemocrats. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Porter\noutlined that \u201c[the politicians] need to be held\nto account and we believe this is the best way\nto do it.\u201d\nThe Education Activist Network (EAN)\nhelping organise the protests and run by a\nmember of the N.U.S. national executive committee Mark Bergfeld, has been in discussions\nover plans to not only target key locations in\nLondon on what they are calling \u2018Day X\u2019 but\nalso to attempt a raid on Clegg\u2019s home in his\nconstituency of Sheffield Hallam. They are\nalso encouraging schoolchildren to become involved alongside students and walk out of lessons on the day.\nThe EAN has based its attack on the Liberal\nDemocrats on \u2018revelations from the Guardian\u2019 suggesting that MPs planned to go back\non their tuition fee promises before they were\neven made.\nAnother group of activists, the National\nCampaign Against Fees and Cuts, also strongly\nsupport the planned walkouts on Wednesday. A\npress statement released by NCAFC states that\nthey \u2018expect over 1000 people\u2019 followed by\n\u2018direct action\u2019, though a disclaimer warns that\n\u2018all actions planned are of legal, non-violent\nnature\u2019.\nElsewhere across the country, other protests\nare ongoing, with 200 students occupying a\nlecture theatre at the University of Sussex on\nMonday evening. Those involved have fashioned a series of timetabled events alongside a\n\u2018quiet study space\u2019 (presumably for those who\nwant to put their prime location to use) in the\nroom, with debates and discussions hosted by\npolitical societies and open mic events taking\nplace. The protest has seen support from local\nMP Caroline Lucas, who became the first ever\nGreen Party candidate to be elected at the last\ngeneral election in May.\nThe repercussions from the demonstration on\nNovember 10th are clearly still ongoing across\nthe country. Whether the next set of protests\nwill achieve the same level of media coverage\nand public awareness, whether for the right or\nwrong reasons, will likely determine how the\nnext stages of the debate will proceed.\n\u2018Day of Action\u2019 planned for 24th November\nMatt Colvin\nStudent groups are seeking to recreate the scenes seen at Conservative HQ\nPhoto by Miles Robertson\n\n"
