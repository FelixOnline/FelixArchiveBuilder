    "content": "Azhar Ali Abidi tells the tale of his travels on his...\nJourney to Kashgar\nJourney to Kashgar Long journeys have difficult\nbeginnings. In the early morning the alarm pierces\nthrough your dreams and shatters your sleep. You eat\nyour porridge with a foul taste in your mouth. Look\nat yourself in the mirror and hate what you see. But\nslowly the apprehension of what is to come awakens\nyour senses. You make a last check of your backpack:\nwater purifying tablets, insect repellent, water bottle,\ncamera and films, change of underwear, diary,\nsleeping bag, passport, and two hundred dollars\nhidden in three different places. Everything in order,\nand ready to go.\n'Have you packed your toothpaste?' 'Yes mother.'\nAnd you put your toothpaste into an already bursting\nside pocket. 'Let us know when you get there son.'\n'Sure father.' I was on my way to China.\nI had first been on this route at the age of\nseventeen, when a group of us were taken\nmountaineering on the Rakaposhi. For the uninitiated,\nthis is an arrogant twenty seven thousand feet high\nmountain and rather difficult to climb. It also proved\na little bit too much for some of us, and our rag tag\nexpedition had to turn back at the base camp. We had\nrun out of water, one chap had lost his helmet after\nhe dropped his chocolate in a valley and went looking\nfor it, and I faced the wrath of the accompanying\nmullah who found out that I had been feasting on a tin of preserved pork meat. That was also thrown\ndown the valley. We had to content ourselves with\nclimbing some insignificant peaks, fishing in the river\nand eyeing the indigenous females.\nA bus took us to the Chinese border. While climbing\na steep hill, it momentarily stopped (we held our\nbreaths) and then started rolling downhill (we yelled\nand jumped out of windows). The driver muttered\n'Inshallah' and managed to stop the bus, a feat which\nhe sincerely ascribed to the help of God. We had to\nwalk a few miles uphill before a military truck gave\nus a lift to the Pakistan-Chinese border. A small\nreconnaissance team went with the truck to the\nChinese post five miles inside the border. I stayed\nback with some friends at the border where we took\n. pictures and stood in a row to relieve ourselves in\nChinese soil. An angry reconnaissance party returned\nafter an hour. Their frater ni sing with the Chinese\nsoldiers (who possessed wine) had been frustrated by\nthe diabolic mullah.\nCaught in the London rush hour traffic, or while\nwaiting in a supermarket queue, I look back upon\nthese memories with nostalgia. In the daily web of dull\nroutines, even the worst moments of exotic journeys\nseem bearable. Now I had returned to see if the Silk\nroute still held the romance that had captured me as\nan adolescent. This time however, I was travelling to\nthe Chinese city of Kashgar.\nOur odyssey started at Islamabad airport. A friend\nand I boarded a Fokker flight to Gilgit. We were flying\nPIA. A German gentleman in the cabin made an\nattempt at a joke, 'Zat means Please Inform Allah,\nya!'. My friend was not amused. The Teutonic sense\nof humour, unlike their beer, lacks ingredients. Flights\nwere heavily booked in early August and we were\nlucky with the American Express travel agents to get\ntwo seats. The in flight service was without a smile\nand purely functional. A waitress tossed us little trays\ncontaining sandwiches and tea-cups. These were\nPage 10\nPakistan\u2014Gilgit\npromptly snatched away after ten minutes. An English\nlanguage newspaper told of U.S. warships closing in\non Iran. My ancestors are Persian. Being a witness to\nthe game that politicians play with our lives often\nproves too much. Refraining from any expression of\noutrage in the small cabin (also lacking the tools\nthereof), I silently cursed all politicians to the seventh\nring of hell.\nFrom the plane I could easily see the Karakoram\nhighway running the length of the river Indus. Just\nbefore we touched down at Gilgit airport, we saw an\nawesome sight. The Nanga Parbat, a mighty\nmountain, stood no more than five miles away,\ntowering above us like a Queen of Titans. Tourists\nfumbled with their cameras and took many pictures.\nI merely gazed.\nGilgit is a hot and arid city. Small Suzuki vans\noperate a taxi service between the airport and the city\ncentre. They take you to a hotel of their choice, after\nhaving struck a deal with the manager there. Morever,\nthey give the impression of a Jong ride by driving\naround the town once and then demand a lot of\nmoney. We found that it was better to walk a little\nand settled in a pleasant inn run by a nice, plump man.\nA broad road runs through the city centre. There are\ndozens of roundabouts at junctions where narrow\nstreets join the main road. Traffic wardens hang about\nlazily and guide what little traffic comes their way.\nColourful buses and big lumbering trucks rumble past\nsmall shops, belching smoke and blaring horns.\nMy travelling companion suggested that we hire\nbikes and explore the surroundings. The landscape\noutside Gilgit is very beautiful. Little villages and\nhouses blend perfectly into the countryside. Little\nchildren rolled in dust amid laughter and tears.\nOccasionally a Suzuki van or jeep tore through the\nsilence. We stopped at a fishing spot called Kargah.\nThis area is off the beaten track and definitely a rock\nclimber's paradise. Nearby a large Buddha had been\ncarved in the rock face of a mountain by ancient\nBuddhist pili grim s. Our bus to China was a colourful body. Written on\nits backside were flowery verses that spoke of a maiden with long black hair. Hand painted also was\nthe maximum speed of the vehicle and its age. The\nformer beyond the machine's capacity, and the latter\nimpossibly tender. The bus reminded me of ageing\nbeauties who sit in the London Underground looking\nrepeatedly at their window reflection to make sure\nthat the wrinkles are hidden, the lips pout and their\neyes do not show their desperation. The luggage was\nbundled on the roof and tied down with ropes.\nBackpacks were tucked between our legs. A vicious\nlooking character claimed my seat and before I could\nargue intelligently, he pushed me in the chest. An ugly\nscene very nearly followed, but not quite. Some\nelderly gentlemen with flowing white beards\nintervened, and stopped a punch up. The Vicious\nCharacter later apologised and became very friendly.\nThat prevented me from giving him a good nose job.\nI shall always regret that opportunity in the crowded\nbus.\nWe were finally on our way to Karimabad, the\ncapital city of Hunza. Landslides on this route can\noften hinder progress, as happened to a Dutch student\nwhom I met later. He had to walk two days to get\nthere. Our bus took three hours. I must also mention\nthe kind tractor driver who towed us for a short\nstretch. The natives of Hunza drink water of grey\ncolouration, and encourage outsiders to do so, much\nto the latter's consternation. I met several emaciated\ntourists who fell ill after having drunk such liquid. They\nhad believed that it was the elixir of life. Yet people\nin Hunza do lead vigorous lives. There were some\nliving specimens sitting by the roadside, gazing at\nnothing in particular (undoubtedly performing mental\nacrobatics of Zen), and they were born before the\nGreat War. We chose to purify our water with chlorine\nbased tablets. I continued to do so all the way to\nKashgar. It tasted like swimming pool water but I never had any stomach problems. My friend stayed\nat Karimabad and returned home in a few days.\n\n"

The package, called\n'con voc ate', is a computer program designed to make\nthe allocation and running of residences more efficient\nand centralised.\nThe package was bought last March from 'Star\nComputer Services' with money from the college's equipment grant fund. It will be working fully by next\nOctober at the latest, according to Mr. John Rowe,\nSystems Manager of the operations group at I.C. Mr. Rowe said that the system has had to be tailored\nto IC's needs. It was going to be used in parallel with\nthe present system as from this December to ensure\nthat no problems would arise when the new system\neventually takes over from the old.'We aren't going\nto commit ourselves to any system coming down from\ncon voc ate in error', he said.\nHe added that the old system is rather inefficient\nand involves a lot of manual data hunting. The new\nsystem will speed up the booking of accommodation\nfor students and for conferences during the summer\nvacation.\nThere have been problems with the implementation\nof the system in Strathclyde (Glasgow) and Edinburgh\nUniversities, though both Mr. Rowe and Star\nComputer Services assured FELIX that neither of\nthese problems rested with the program. Mr. Dave\nBeer, of Star Computer Services maintained that\n'computers are only as good as those who operate\nthem.'\nFox bolts\nThe Chairman of ICU Conservative Society (Consoc),\nMs Nicky Fox, has resigned because of personal\nobjections to some of the latest Govemement policies.\nShe told FELIX that she felt compelled to resign\nwhen she realised she could no longer guide Consoc\nas since she was opposed to policies on Student Loans,\nthe Poll Tax and the charisma-cult of Mrs Thatcher.\nMs Fox will remain as political representative to\nSocial Clubs Committee, advising all political\nsocieties on funding and the Union.\nCaterpillar\nCafe\nTasty, hot vegetarian and meat\ndishes every day\nalso a stunning variety of\nsalads, pizzas, burgers and\npies\nRounded off with sandwiches,\nyum ny cakes and fresh coffee THE UNION BUILDING, BEIT QUAD\nBags and clothing were stolen from the Union\nBuilding changing rooms last Friday in the latest of\na series of opportunist thefts.

College Security Officer,\nTerry Briley believes that the thief or thieves know\ntheir way around the building and may even be\nstudents.\nIC Union Deputy President, Dave Williams is\nplanning an anti-theft publicity campaign and steps\nare being taken to make entry to the building more\ndifficult. People found in the building may be asked\nto show their union cards. College Security is\ninvestigating the possibility of installing a 'selective\nentry system' for the changing rooms.\nA student was taken to hospital after becoming\ninvolved in a fight in the Union Bar on Friday\nevening. The incident is being treated seriously by\nthe Union.

Some of the companies present\ncomplained and Mr De Silva asked security to ask\nthe group to move.

    "content": "My stop was the Pakistani immigration and customs\ncheck post of Sust. The bus arrived there in the\nevening. I had now joined up with an English student\nfrom Oxford. Calum was on his way to Bejing\nintending to take a ride on the Trans-Siberian. He was\nstudying Chinese at college and as things turned out\nlater, showed that he could also utilise it. He became\na very fine travelling companion.\nAt high altitudes, food is often not properly cooked.\nOur chicken curry was a Piece de Resistance.\nFeverishly we pulled and tugged at the dead bird,\ntrying to render it into small edible pieces. This proved\nuseless, so we returned it as if nothing had happened\nand asked for another dish. I had put some re hydrating salts in my water bottle, and the pure liquid had now\nacquired a sweet taste. Calum thereafter lived with\ndrinking very little water. We were always hungry and\nscavenging for food. This was also due to the fact that\nwe travelled light; I had a can of hard cheddar cheese,\nand Calum carried a packet of Peak Freans biscuits.\nThere was never enough clean water to drink. Once\na Chinese waiter filled my water bottle with hot green\ntea, which came as a shock. But these problems were\nminor and did not slow us down.\nAt 35pa night, our hotel room was the cheapest\nin the whole of Sust. The hospitable staff served us\nwith brimming cups of delicious hot Chai. Presently\nCalum dived into the sediment at the bottom of his\nrucksack and emerged with a copy of Viz. We flicked\nthrough it to catch up on the slimy jokes. As things\nturned out, the magazine became (as it ought to be)\nsubstitute toilet paper. We were asked to fill in the\nguest book. Previous entries included Dutch whores,\nEnglish plumbers, Japanese magicians and American\nastronauts. To this were added a Crown Prince\naccompanied by Dr. Indiana Jones. 'Good night your\nHighness', I croaked. Amid sensations of insects\ncrawling up our legs, we drifted into sleep.\nThe next morning we headed to the Customs post.\nA large crowd of Pakistani traders had gathered here.\nAmid excuses and abuses, we shoved and pushed our\nway to the front. Calum was to learn that in this part\nof the world, there was no concept of queues\nwhatsoever. Seeing that we looked like innocent\nbackpackers, the officials cleared us in no time. Now\ncame a bigger problem. We were to head to the\nChinese border in a red Toyota Landcruiser. Calum\nwanted to get the best view. The front seat had\nalready been taken by the Vicious Character. After\nmuch ado, Calum chose to sit behind the driver. This\ndid not work out as everyone had been given seat\nnumbers and ours were right at the back. Our view\nwas hence limited through the rear windows. Calum\nasked the Punjabi sitting in front if he would mind\nswapping seats. But he did not want a stranger to sit\nnext to his wife, 'Wot! Noo. I sit vith the la die z.' Calum was immensely displeased by this situation\nas he had no intention of seducing the fat woman. His\nacid reply remains unprintable. To compensate for the\nloss, we persuaded the driver to stop at all scenic\nspots, and promised to put him in a lot of pictures.\nEn route we passed several people who were walking\nand one odd American who was mending a puncture\non his mountain bike. The scenery was simply\nmagn if ici ent. The mountains were larger than those\nwe had seen before. Goats grazed in small patches\nof grassland. Out there somewhere, snow leopards\nlurked in the terrible wilderness. The Punjabis were\nplaying Indian pop music on the stereo. Calum was\nnot amused by this breach of the aesthetic and\nannounced so. I expressed our mutual disgust in\ngentle words, and asked the fellow passengers to turn\nit off. They were kind enough to turn down the\nvolume. The pass that connects China and Pakistan\nby road is called Khunjerab, or 'Valley of Blood'. The\nroad is dangerous in some places, and first time\ntravellers might be intimidated by the shear drops into\nthe river, or the constant hazard of landslides. Yet an\nElizabethan explorer had dismissed it as '...an\nexcursion for the ladies...'. We stopped there to fill\nour water bottles with virgin snow and took some\npictures.\nOur jeep arrived at the Chinese post of Pirali after\nroughly two hours. Officials stamped our passports\nand made a cursory check on our backpacks. They\nare usually quite lenient towards tourists. Their wrath\nshows itself upon the Pakistani traders who bring in\na lot of goods, and do the same while going out.\nOutside the Customs building we were met by a Chinese television crew. Obviously they were making\nfilms to show people that despite what happened in\nTianamenn Square, tourists were still coming to\nChina. Hating to find ourselves in pro pog and a newsreels, we stayed well away.\nThe Chinese monetary system is complicated and\nthose who hate finance should skip this paragraph.\nAt the border we changed our dollars into FEC (Foreign\nexchange certificate). It should be noted that dollars\nand FEC fetch a high value in the Chinese black\nmarket. The ordinary currency inside China is called\nChina\u2014Kashgar\nThe Abakh Khoja Tomb\nRimimbi. We exchanged our FEC for Rimimbi in\nTashkurgan and Kashgar. If you look foreign enough,\nshady characters are bound to approach you sooner\nor later and try to sell Rimimbi. These 'illegal' deals\nare negotiated with a pen and a piece of paper.\nExchange rates may vary between 1:1.6 to 1:2. The\nshady characters are seasoned con men. We always\ncounted the money before accepting it.\nKashgar is a long way from Pirali. Long bus drives\nain't no fun. When you sit for endless hours in a bus\nfull of pale foreigners, imposing Pathans, and babbling\nPunjabis, a musty smell of sweat and unwashed\nbodies can become quite overpowering. The absence\nof proper 'facilities' in these areas means that you\nhave to take your toilet roll (or Viz) and wander out\nto find a deserted spot near a river. Squat and\ncom template the waves. Or hide behind a clump of\nbush and observe insect life at close hand. Either way\nhope not to be detected and be quick.\nTashkurgan is the first settlement inside China. It\nis ninety kilometers from Pirali. The population mainly\nconsists of Central Asian Tadjiks. They are fair and\nhave green eyes, probably traces of early Aryan\norigins. Tadjik women are very attractive - almond\neyes in chiselled faces. They wear bright silk skirts\nand colourful hats, and walk with an elegant gait. A contingent of PLA soldiers maintains a constant\npresence. They fill their empty hours with tobacco and\nsnooker. On the furthermost end of town, the Tadjiks\nlive in mud houses, much as they have lived for\ncountless centuries. They are a quiet folk and do not\nshow much interest in outsiders. Indeed they regard\nthe Han Chinese and their protagonists as intruders\nupon their land.\nA thousand years ago, a princess of Cathay had\ncome this way and erected a fortress on top of a hill.\nLittle now remains of the fortress except mud walls\nin ruins. It is believed that beyond the northern\nperimeter wall ran the original Silk route.\nIt was getting dark and a thunderstorm was\napproaching from the east. Unperturbed we scaled the\nperimeter wall and landed a thousand years back in\ntime. Calum was ecstatic. 'Marco! Eat your heart\nout...' he yodelled and pressed his palms onto the flat\nground. We stood on a dust road that was bounded\nby a five foot high wall on its outer side. So this was\nthe silk route whereupon once turban ed merchants led\ncamel caravans to the golden cities of Samarkand and\nXanadu. What mighty kings and fearsome armies\nmust have trodden upon this path, and turned into the\ndust that now lay under our feet? We left when the\nrain turned into a hailstorm\nOfficially all China runs on Peking standard time.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "Hockey\nIC 1-5 LSE 1-1\nThe first UAU match of the year saw IC Men's1st team continue their unbeaten run with a51 victory\nover LSE.\nThe first half started slowly, but when IC managed\nto adapt to the bumpy grass pitch from the 'astro'\nwhich they were used to, they immediately looked the\nbetter side.\nIC's first short corner of the match just went wide,\nbut it wasn't long before the second 'short ie' was put\naway by Mike Marshall. Short corners proved to be\nthe decisive part of the game with all 5 IC goals\nresulting from them.\nThe combination of Mark Rayfield pushing out, Hari\nVamadevan stopping and Mark London striking\nworked extremely well with Mark getting 3 goals.\nMark Rayfield got the final goal after doing an\nimpression of a beached whale while flicking the ball\nover the keeper from a saved short.\nThe game may have been won on short corners but\nthey wouldn't have resulted but for excellent play in\nthe half back line.\nIC were unlucky to concede the single goal when\nan awkward bounce set an LSE player free. Until then\nthe defence had coped more than adequately with\nPaul Lowercombe marking their centre forward totally\nout of the game.\nHopefully this fine performance can be repeated in\nthe other UAU matches to come.\nIC 11-1 LSE II\u20140\nAfter waiting a considerable time for the 1st's game\nto finish, the 2nd's went into the game with great\nconfidence as the result last year was 8-0 to IC, but\nthey only ended up just beating them 1-0.\nThe game started extremely scrap pil y, partly due\nto the bad grass surface and partly the umpiring which\nwas generally very bad throughout the game. IC\nwould have done better but they lowered their play\ndown to LSE's worse level. A few chances were\nsquandered for IC but LSE never looked like scoring.\nIC started the second half with more vigour as they\nneeded a good score against LSE to win their group\nin the UAU. A hit was given to IC halfway through\nthe second half which was taken about 10 yards\noutside the LSE 'D'. Colin Wright struck the ball hard\nand Dave Millard poached a goal from almost nothing\nby creeping behind the defence and deflecting the ball\ninto the net to score a goal. A good win for IC?\nMixed Tournament\u2014Motspur Park\nWho ever thought of getting up on a cold, wet\nmorning to play a few games of mixed hockey after\na heavy session in the Bar the night before? Well, it\nwas Hassan Majid and Kevin Hill\u2014they were the ones\nwho organised the greatest mixed hockey event of the\nyear.\nIC managed to drag two teams from their beds and\na mad cyclist who didn't enjoy the ride there and back.\nDespite the sense of humour lost by several teams\nwho managed to take a full strength 1 st team, we all\nhad a good time by 'switching' positions on the field\nand getting seriously pissed off with the rain.\nStars of the day were Colin Wright who managed\na couple of magnificent saves in goal, Dave Millard\nfor a great comeback to his natural centre-forward\nposition by scoring twice and Lisa Preedy who took\nhis sexist comments all day.\nIC II brilliantly executed their ploy of lulling future\nopposition into a false sense of security with a21 defeat against LSE.\nIC went in with a10 half-time lead after N Leonard\nhad managed to get his fringe onto an A Pinto corner.\nHis delicate touch confused the LSE defence, and an\nensuing deflection was punched into his own net by\nthe keeper.\nThe second half was used to good effect to bring\nthe IC ploy into action-a more relaxed perform ace allowing LSE to score 2 goals midway through the\nhalf.\nWith opposition now suitably confused it is time for\nIC to respond and reveal their true excellence. Yes\nfolks, they lost 2-1.\nSix-a side\nTournament\nIC 1 sts fell at the last hurdle in the annual ULU six-a side tournament at Motspur Park, going down 2-0 to\nSt Thomas' in the final.\nIC finished top of their first-round group after\nbeating QMC 2-1, LSE 3-0 and going down 2-0 to St\nThomas', all the goals coming from Pat and Felix. The\nquarter final brought IC's best performance, against\na UC side that had yet to concede a goal. IC won 2-0\nwith one goal each for Pat and Felix.\nThe semi-final against LSE was a gruelling\nencounter with IC well on top but unable to break the\ndeadlock. At 0-0 after extra time the match was\ndecided on a sudden death penalty shoot out. Si\nHolden saved LSE's first effort and was off on a victory lap before being ordered back by the ref, who\nadjudged that the IC skipper had moved before the\nball was kicked. Justice was done two shots later\nwhen LSE hit the bar and Chris Burton cool y slotted\nthe winning penalty home.\nIC had the better of the first half in the final and only\na brilliant save from the St Thomas' keeper kept Pat\nFancokc out. However, in the second period the legs\nbegan to tire and it still took a cruel deflection off the\nboot of Chris Burton to give St Thomas the lead. IC\npressed forward in search of the equalise r but could\nfind no way through and St Thomas were able to grab\na second goal on a counter attack. IC's achievement\nin coming second was all the more remarkable as they\nonly had the minimum of 6 players instead of the usual\nsquad of 8.\nA spectacular thirty yard own goal by Ollie Guerkin,\nLSE's right back, in the first minute of the second half\ngave IC the points in this crucial UAU/ULU league\ngame.\nIC had fallen behind midway through the first half\nafter a long kick from the LSE keeper caused\nconfusion at the back, allowing one of their forwards\nto nip in and score. A period of confusion followed\nwhen IC, not finding their usual rhythm were unsettled\nby the blustery conditions. LSE nearly extended their\nlead when Stu Miller managed to put LSE clean\nthrough but Si Holden saved well. IC gradually settled\ndown and deservedly pulled level with a great goal\nfrom Femi Omatoya just before the interval.\nThe second half opened with Mr Guerkin's effort:\nunder pressure, he turned and smacked the ball over\nthe keeper's head from thirty yards. This bolstered IC\nand they pushed forward well, Tim Fisher hitting the\nbar with a beautiful free kick and Mike Patton the post\nin a goal mouth scramble. LSE continued to play with\nsome confidence but, despite some indifferent\ngoal keeping, failed to breach the IC defence.\nIC Vl-(0)1 St Thomas 11-(0)1\nIC VI struggled hard in the first half of this match\nagainst gale force winds with keeper Mike Potter\nmaking some excellent saves to keep the score 0-0\nat half-time.\nIn the second half, with the advantage of the wind\nbehind them, IC strode forward with some good\nmidfield work by Narhinda Sangha. Then, from a classy build-up, Phil Caldwell curled the ball past their\nadvancing goalie into the far corner of the net.\nLSE-3 IC-2\nThe IC Men's UAU Squash squad were narrowly\ndefeated last week by a traditionally tough LSE\nopposition. Nick See, our no. 5, put in a credible but\nnervous first performance and lost. Rawle Adams won\neasily 3-7, not as easily though as Joe Devereux who\nthrashed his opponent 3-0 (Joe was a draft-in from\nSt Mary's). Our Mauritian no.2 Colin Taylor looked like\ntaking the match for Imperial, but narrowly lost 3-2.\nThe match then hinged on Craig Robinson beating\nJason Fletcher. A tired and lacklustre performance\nfrom the injured Imperial no.1, Robinson, meant the\nmatch went to LSE.\nPage 15\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX interview...\nProfessor Colin\nBlakemore\nProfessor Colin Blakemore is one of that rare species,\nthe scientist-in-the-public-eye. His BBC2 television\nseries 'The Mind Machine' brought Neural Physiology,\nthe study of the mechanisms of the brain, to a wide\nand largely unscientific audience. IT brought HIM\nunwanted attention and a flood of defamatory articles\nin the tabloid press which stopped only after he\nsuccessfully complained to the Press Council.\nUnsurprisingly, he is a man with strong opinions as\nto how science should be presented to the general\npublic and how far science and politics must mix.\nFELIX spoke to him during September's British\nAssociation meeting at Sheffield.\nA manufacturing country such as the UK, he says,\nmust live off its 'wits and ideas' and its innovations\nin science and technology. Yet he believes that there\nis a nebulous unofficial 'anti-science movement' in\nthis country, though this is by no means an organised\ncampaign but more a willingness on the part of the\ngeneral public to treat science as a convenient\nscapegoat.\nThere are many reasons why such an attitude has\ndeveloped. It can be attributed to unfavourable\npublicity in the press who tend to concentrate on\nemotive issues such as animal experimentation.\nProfessor Blakemore especially criticises the 'knee-jerk, blame science' reaction of certain media hungry\npressure groups. Politicians, ever on the lookout for\nsomewhere to pass the buck, find research an easy\ntarget. There are, he says, only a 'handful' of\nscientists in the public eye and they are expected to\ncomment on every issue.\nThe Professors attitude to the press is obviously\ncoloured by its attitude to him. He admits that\nunfavourable publicity is a hazard of 'putting your\nhead over the parapet of your ivory tower', but it was\nthe bias and inaccuracy of the reports that incensed\nhim. He was accused, among other thing, of being\ninvolved in the use of animals for cosmetic testing,\na completely different field to the one he is working in.\nHowever, things are slowly improving, notably on\ntelevision. Professor Blakemore's 'The Mind Machine'\nand the regular science slots 'Horizon' and 'Antenna'\nare broadcast during prime-time, albeit on BBC2.\nTwenty-five years ago there was no science\nbroadcasting, now it represents 5% of the total BBC\noutput. But Professor Blakemore is still worried about\nthe future and deregulation which, he claims, can only\nmake things worse.\nHe is critical of science education. He thinks that\nscience learnt at school can soon become out of date\nand useless, and argues that more emphasis must be\nplaced on teaching people how science works, in\nwhat it 'can and can't' do. There is a tendency for\npeople, even when they have been bombarded with\nfacts, to ignore the scientific basis. Smoking is a good\nexample. The vast majority of people now accept that\nsmoking is harmful, yet many still smoke. They still\nprefer 'folk statistics' of the 'my father smoked 60\na day and it never did him any harm' school to hard\nscientific fact.\nProfessor Blakemore believes that the national\ncurriculum COULD have been used to improve things,\nbut the opportunity was missed. He dismisses the\nGovernment's City Technology Colleges as\n'insignificant'. He argues that it is impossible to teach\ntraditional Physics and Chemistry up to the age of 16\nwithout frightening people away.\nMuch of the malaise can be blamed on the attitude\nof the Government. The Government, Professor\nBlakemore says, is laying down a disaster. Assorted\ngroups, including the Confederation of British Industry\n(CBI), have openly complained that science funding\nis inadequate. Highly respected senior scientists talk\nof the 'intransigence' of the Prime Minister.\nThe politicians, he says, are far too interested in\n'fads and fancies'. They think in terms of 'flavours of\nthe month'; two years ago Interdisciplinary Research\nGroups were in, now after only two years the\nGovernment has moved on. Proper science needs\nproper consultation, good funding and a chance to\nprove itself.\nProfessor Blakemore argues that scientists must\ninvolve themselves in the politics of science. They\nmust exploit the few good Government ideas and\nemphasise the importance of un commercial 'blue-sky'\nresearch. They must fight against the un competitive salaries and the antiquated working conditions and\noppose 'ridiculous' monetarist funding policies. This,\nhe says,is the only way to stop the Brain Drain to the\nUSA.\nHe claims that science is losing respect.There can\nbe few high-flying academics who have not received\noffers of higher-paid jobs in America. Yet many\nremain; they still feel that they are doing something\nworthwhile and important. How long will they stay\non, he asks, while the Government now openly\naccuses scientists of being lazy and disinterested and\nof being uncooperative with Industry?\nColin Blakemore gave up a career in medicine to\nbecome a research scientist. He felt that the respect,\nthe job security and the freedom made up for the poor\nconditions. He believes that science teaching in this\ncountry is excellent-students from all over the world\ncome to the UK to learn. In fact, it is their money\nwhich keeps the Universities going.\nHowever Professor Blakemore believes that things\nwill improve; all the major opposition political parties\nhave better science policies than the present\nGovernment, and no party, not even Mrs. Thatcher's, can last forever.\n\u2022 Since the earthquake, all sorts of researchers have\nbeen to California, and many agree that the worst is\nstill to come. Theoretical models of the fault are\npredicting that the 'quake is only the first of many.\n\u2022 The Earth's atmosphere is never still: it wavers\nand shakes and distorts the light from the stars: This\nlimits the accuracy of Earth-based observatories; until\nrecently, the only way to avoid the problem was to\nlaunch telescopes into space. Now, astronomers from\nthe European Southern Observatory (ESO) have found\na way to counteract distortion at ground-level.\nThe ESO team have applied the technique of\n'adaptive optics' in which the mirrors in the telescope\nare physically moved to compensate for the vagaries\nof the atmosphere. The system relies on a computer\nto process the image that the telescope produces and\nto correct for distortion using a de formable silicon\nmirror just 1mm thick. The first test, on the 1.52m telescope at the Observatorie de Haute-Provence in\nSouthern France, is said to have raised the telescope's performance to near its theoretical maximum. It is\nestimated that an adaptive optics system could be\ninstalled in a ground-based telescope for around\n$270,000, many times less that the cost of one of\nits space based counterparts.\n\u2022 The nationwide survey of sexual habits, recently\nvetoed by the Prime Minister, is back. A medical\nresearch charity, the Wellcome Trust, has agreed to\nprovide \u00a3900,000 for work to start. The project is\npartially the brain-child of Imperial's Professor\nAnderson.\n\u2022 On 18th October, NASA finally launched its Galileo\nprobe to Jupiter from the shuttle Atlantis after\novercoming legal action by environmental groups. The\nenvironmentalists were worried about the plutonium\npowered probe crashing to earth if there was a second\nChallenger disaster (See 'This Week', FELIX 845).\n\u2022 'America has sub sidi sed the rest of the world too\nlong in science' claims Jim Watson, the DNA pioneer\nand now director of the Human Genome Office of the\nUS National Institute of Health. Watson has asked for\ninternational help in the project to map the Human\nGenome, the DNA which makes up mankind.\n\u2022 Accidents will happen, but it would appear that\nthey happen more often to left-handed people than\nto right-handed, according to recent work.\nStatistically, someone who is left-handed is 54%\nmore likely to damage themselves with tools and 20%\nmore likely to suffer from work- or sport- related\ninjuries. It is worth noting that in our rightist world\n13% of 20 year olds are left-handed but only 1 % of\n80 year olds.\n\u2022 Plans are afoot for the worlds largest ozone\nfriendly freezer. A scheme has been announced to\nstore seeds from the world's most important crops in\na disused mine-shaft under the Norwegian permafrost.\nIt is estimated that under these conditions, barley\nseeds could survive three centuries while certain elms\ncould last only 14 years.\n\u2022 For those interested in such things, there will be\na talk on gravitational lensing on the 7th November\nat 1 pm in Physics LT2. This column is always available\nfor plugs.\nPage 9\n\n"

To\nwrap all of this up there is the Monster Boat Race:\nWadworths have kindly donated afi rk in of 6X for\nwhich the CCU's will theoretically race against each\nother.\nIn the evening there is The RCS smoking concert\nwhich is a collection of interesting but somewhat\ndubious acts and anything amusing will be put in, so\nif you have any ideas please contact John St Hill or\nSyd in the RCS office.\nGuilds Carnival is the last really big event in Rag\nWeek on Friday the 17th. This is much like the other\ncarnivals, with The Man From Delmonte, Howlin' Wilf\nand the Veejays playing, films, videos. Discos, a casino and much more. At 6pm on Friday Dance Soc\nstart their Dance marathon for Children in need in the\nJCR which will continue on until Saturday evening.\nSaturday morning (yes it does and will exist) sees\nthe first half of the 24-hour collection also for Children\nin Need, but more importantly th fer e is the world's most wild and wa k ky sponsored event ever; namely\nthe sponsored nude kami kaz i parachute jump. The\nparachute jump itself is not the hard part: it being only\n2ft of free fall out the back of a mini bus. The mini bus\nis actually outside Harrods at the time and the\nparticipants are only wearing a crash helmet, a static\nline parachute, a reserve and a pair of boots as they\nexit the mini bus. The challenge is to get back to\nPrince's gardens without being arrested. As the saying\ngoes, you need balls to do something like this.\nIn the evening, as the second part of 24-hour\ncollection, there is the Leukaemia Research pub crawl,\nwhich they have got a door to door licence for. And\nso ends rag week, ten days of mayhem which might\njust kill me, then we can all at last catch up on all the\nsleep and work we've missed out on.\nEvents going on throughout Rag Week:\nGuilds Hitsquad will be operating Flanning so if you\nwant to get a shaving foam pie shoved in someone's face, take out a contract in the Guilds Office for \u00a32\n(contact lens wearers can get a badge that means\nthey don't get hit directly in the face). RCS will be\nrunning Grim Reaping and Gnoming: what happens is\nthat for \u00a35 your target will be followed around by the\nGrim Reaper or by a Gnome all day or until they pay\nthem to go and follow someone else. Contracts can\nbe taken out in the RCS office.\nKiller will be running from 12 midnight on\nWednesday the 8th after beer festival. What happens\nis that to join you pay \u00a32 and hand in 2 passport\nphotos of yourself and you get given a target and a set of rules on how you can legitimately kill them.\nOnce you have killed them you take over their contract\nand so the game goes on until there are theoretically\ntwo very nervous people stalking each other around\nCollege (or it just degenerates into gang warfare like\n2 years' ago). Either way it is a pretty good game if\nit is played properly. You can sign up at the beer\nfestival or earlier as advertised. The prizes for killer\nare pretty good and may involve a free game of\nSkirmish for you and your friends.\nRag will hopefully be running 'kidnap-a lecturer-a gram' whereby, the authorities permitting; a lecturer\nis kidnapped during his/her lecture and is held as long\nas possible, \u00a32 a minute is raised from the class (when\nno more donations are received, they are returned).\nPage 6\nPostscript:\nIt is past 10pm again and I'm still in College. What\nMonopoly proved to me is that if a lot of people just\ncontribute a small amount of time and effort, great\nthings can be done. I hope you go to some of the\nevents in Rag Week, I hope you go to all of them, but\nmore importantly I hope you enjoy them; because if\nyou're not enjoying things you might as well give up\nand become a tug boat captain.\nLove and damp mackerel,\nHal Calamvokis, Rag Chairman 89-90.\nThe\nCharities\nThese are the five charities that Rag is going to\nsupport: The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association\nobviously train and supply guide dogs to blind people.\nThis, however, is a lot more than it sounds. To its\nowner, a guide dog is much more than a surrogate pair\nof eyes, it is a means of self-reliance and\nindependence.\nThe Imperial Cancer Research Fund is one of the\nlargest charities around, ICRF conduct pure research\ninto the fields related to gaining a better knowledge\nof cancer and how and why it happens.\nThe British Insitute for Brain Injured Children\n(BIBIC) is based in Somerset and is an old favourite\nwith IC Rag. They are a small charity, with a turnover\nof less than \u00a3200,000. They give remedial help to\nmentally handicapped children, attempting to give\nthem back control of their bodies, teaching them how\nto use their muscles and limbs.\nThe British Bone Marrow Donor Appeal is a trust\ncommitted to supporting the compilation and\nmaintenance of a fully computerised tissue library\nfrom potential bone marrow donors. This is needed\nto provide help for Leukaemia sufferers and people\nwith other bone marrow related diseases.\nThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF) was established\nas a channel for popular concern about conservation\nto create effective action.

Tiddlywinks made \u00a32,000 for Action\nAid, monopoly made \u00a36,100 for MENCAP, the Rag\nRaid to Guildford on the 25th made \u00a3500 for BIBIC\nand \u00a3 1,000 was raised on Saturday in Covent Garden\nfor the World Wildlife fund. Rag now moves into\nserious overdrive for Rag Week:\nRag Week\nRag Week, which starts on the 8th November, is\nwhen the largest chunk of money is raised for the\nyear. Actually Rag Week is ten days long (we at IC\nlike to be different) and is the best excuse to have a wild time and do very little work, that anyone has ever\ncome up with.\nThe RCS beer festival in the JCR on Wednesday\nafternoon is the traditional start to Rag Week. Last\nyear 1,100 people consumed in the region of 700\ngallons of beer, cider and perry and this year around\ntwo and a half tonnes of beer has been ordered. The\nevent runs from midday to 11 pm and what you do is\nyou buy your official beer festival glass which has the\nRag Logo on the side and then you quaff your real ale\nfrom this. During the festival there are all the culinary\ndelights that you would expect at an event like this\nincluding curries and burgers.\nThe Beer festival is also when the now infamous\nIC Rag Mag comes out and this years' looks to be a real cork er even if I do say so myself. The Rag Mag\nwill be on sale at the Rag Stall where you can also\nbuy your Rampant Rhino 9-0 tee-shirt, Rag Week\ntickets and other delights, so be there or be a total\nand utter social dropout.\nOn the night of Thursday the 9th is the Rocky Horror\nDisco in the Lounge, so if you're a sweet trans vest ive, enjoy doing the time warp or being Janet this is a must. The hypnosis lecture, on friday the 11th in the\nGreat Hall is not to be missed. Martin S Taylor's act\nis constantly changing: Last year we saw Cosmic\n(a.k.a. Dave Clements) talking Martian and seeing\nelephants, so if you're sceptical about hypnotism or\njust want a brilliant night's entertainment Martin is\nyour man. If you're not sure about Volunteering as a \u2022 ll l l'iu u u u subject there is no need to worry as Martin has plenty\nof credentials that he would lose if he did anything\nnaughty and he doesn't make you do anything too\nembarrassing anyway. Please get there fairly early as\nit fills up quickly.\nSaturday is the Royal British Legion's collection day\nand we are going on a Rag Raid to Maidstone for the\nPoppy Day collection. If you want to go please come\nto a Rag Meeting or sign up at the Rag stall at the beer\nfestival. Back at home is the Sci-Fi marathon starting\nat midday in the SCR with films, games, videos and\nlots more to satisfy any intergalactic wanderer. SCAB\nV is on the night of the 11th and is totally\nev n iron mentally friendly. SCAB is the organisation\nthat encompasses all the producing societies at\nImperial like Dramsoc, Opsoc, Rocksoc, Jazz Club etc\nand they all put on one big production.\nSunday is traditionally a CCU day. First there is the\nthree way tug-of-war between the three onsite CCU's in Prince's Gardens and then there is the Raft Race\nacross the serpentine in Hyde park.\nOn the night of Monday the 13th there is the\ncomedy night in the concert hall: Malcolm Hardy will\nbe comp e ring Simon Bligh, Otis Canaloni and Lee\nEvans which should be a very good night.\nThe Guilds Slave Auction is on Tuesday the 14th in Mech Eng 220 and is well worth going to even if\nyou are not going to make a purchase. If you fancy\ndoing a bit of bidding for the more tastier morsels on\ndisplay remember that 'group bidding' gives you more\nspending power. Hopefully Rugby Club will be making\ntheir traditional sexist bid. Immediately after they have\nbeen sold, the execs of the three CCU's and ICU get\nbundled into a mini bus for Exec Initiative: where we\ndrop them off somewhere very poetic and they are\ntied together in pairs and they have to make it back\nto College in time for the Dirty Disco: which is\norganised by RSM and has got itself the reputation\nas being the wildest party in Rag Week. 'Dirty' is the\nkey word so, fundamentally, anything goes as long\nas it doesn't involve live/dead animals/children,\nvacuum cleaners or sharp kitchen utensils i.e. it's an\nawfully good evening all round. If this isn't your scene\nyou could go to the Sci-Fi Soc film in Mech Eng 220.\nWednesday the 15th sees Hit the hit squad in\nCovent Garden, they'll tell you more if you want to\nknow. In the evening there is the Bar Quiz in the snack\nbar which is fairly self explanatory.\nPage 5\n\n"

    "content": "Rebel natives however keep local time, and many\nothers simply do not care. We always synchronise d our watches with the bus driver, or the people in the\nticket office. It took us six hours to reach Kashgar.\nThe Central Asian landscape has a beauty which is\ntoo wild to describe. It is a measureless wilderness.\nThere are vast swamps, red mountains, sand dunes,\nand numerous boulders strewn like a million pearls.\nWild camels roam in the backdrop of the Pamirs.\nPeter Fleming undertook this journey in 1935. His\ntravel account is described in a classic book called\n'News from Tartary'. In those days, the journey from\nGilgit to Kashgar took something like thirty days.\nThanks to the Karakoram Highway, this has now been\ncut down to three. Fleming's Kashgar was teeming\nwith Russian spies, British agents, Swedish\nmissionaries and all other sorts of colourful characters.\nAmid intrigue and conspiracies, lavish ban quests were\nthrown by rival Powers, and people got killed. The\npresent day town is tame in comparison. You run the\nrisk of being run down by a donkey cart, conned by\na Shady Character, or falling victim to stomach\nproblems.\nKashgar is an Oasis town on the rim of the\nTaklamakan desert. The population is predominantly\nUyger by race, and Muslim by faith. This is a medieval\ncity with an extreme climate. We rode in a donkey cart\nto the Seman hotel. This used to be the Russian\nConsulate. A couple of stunning hostesses greeted us\nat the reception. In their native costumes they looked\n'...dressed to kill...' in the words of wide-eyed Calum.\nA man of good taste. I wondered at the nature and\nextent of their services but could not find out more\nas the room charges were quite expensive, and we\nhad to leave this charming place for a cheaper hotel.\nI changed into shorts and shot out of the hotel like\na bat from hell, straight to the 'Oasis cafe'. This is a Parisian style rest u a rant opposite Seman. There I ordered a beer and settled next to an attractive young\nlady who looked very colonial with a square green hat\non golden blonde hair. 'May 1 borrow your guide\nbook?', she asked. 'Sure.' I settled back in my seat.\nI finished my golden nectar and she ate her yoghurt.\n'So you lived in Notting Hill ?' She envied me. 'Yes\nI used to. Isn't it a nice place?' 'There are so many\ncosy little restuarants. Oh yes...' She hummed to\nherself. I ordered a yoghurt. 'Will you go back to\nLondon?' 'Yes I think I will.' She mused, 'But first I want to go to my parents' home in New Zealand. They\nhave a big house and.a garden, you know. A change\nfrom my gro tty flat in Ealing.'\nShe returned my book, and we ate our yoghurts.\n'Where do you plan to go ?' She asked. 'I am not quite\nsure. Maybe I 'll travel up to Turfan. What about you?'\n'Me and my girlfriend are thinking of going to the\nRussian border. There is a lot of raw beauty there you\nknow, and some sort of lake as well.' For a while I seriously considered including the Russian border in\nmy itinerary. A silence followed. She wrote something\nin her diary and finally got up. 'Are there any good\nplaces to eat around here ?' I asked. 'Try the shops\ndown the road. We do. They serve nice dinner.'\nThe Eidgah is a big mosque in the centre of town\nand forms the focal point of many activities. The\nfaithful sit placidly on the front steps and wait for the\ncall for prayers. Street hawkers sell bracelets, old\ncoins, and rings under the shadow of the minaret.\nLittle children dance gleefully around lone tourists and\nbeg them to take their pictures. Old men with chiselled\nweather-beaten faces and pointed beards, shuffle\npast in long boots, conical hats, and warm thick black\ncoats. There attire has not changed since the times\nof Genghiz Khan. In the dusty sun-lit alleys, \"... slant\neyed Kirghiz and bearded Tadjiks from the hills move\nwith a hint of swagger among the self-effacing Turkis.\nHere and there a stiff black horse-hair veil, a brightly\nstriped rope betrayed a woman from Andijan or\nSamarkand...\" Nearby is a medieval market that is a labyrinth of numerous narrow lanes. Bazaaris sit in\nPage 12\nlittle cluttered shops and sell curved knifes, fur hats,\njade, silk, carpets and hashish.\nThe next morning, we found to our disgust that\nthere was no water in the toilets and the loos were\nchoked. Indeed, in the sincere words of Gabriel Garcia\nMarquez; \"...a tender breath of human shit, warm and\nsad, rose above the city and stirred the certainty of\ndeath in the depths of ones so u!\". We hired bicycles and went to the bus-stop. It\nlooked more like a chicken farm. Calum plunged\nstraight into the mass of small stature d people and\nhad an animated conversation in Chinese with the\nwoman behind the counter. He succeeded in getting\na ticket to Turfan for the next morning. I bought a ticket back to Sust and asked what time the bus left.\nWe spent that evening at the Oasis cafe and chatted\nwith some French tourists and a couple of Pakistani\ngirls.\nMuch later I ventured out alone towards the Eidgah\nmosque. It was very dark and crowds were thinning\nout in bars and restuarants. But the Square bustled\nwith a thousand people: shadows in the night with\nno faces. This was a scene stolen from 'The Arabian\nNights'. Strange aromas drifted from dark alleys and\nmelted into the cool night air. Old men sitting on the\nground sold Turkish sweets. Little groups of\nphilosophers chatted at the mosque entrance. A few\nmen sat here and there, playing cards in the orange\nlight of lanterns. Women peeked secretly from green\nshutters, but vanished before one could catch a glimpse of their unveiled faces. Tired men sat on the\nsteps of their houses, their fingers round a cigarette,\nand the bright ember would light up their crinkled\neyes. Shish kebabs were being roasted on red hot\ncoal. A man practised the strings of his guitar. I stopped at a street vendor's shop and asked for Qulfi\n(ice-cream made from milk and sugar). The\nshopkeeper borrowed my camera and took a few\nshots at crazy angles. He also charged me for the\nQulfi.\nThe next morning Calum was up early and looked\nin poor shape. His lips were parched, and he kept\ncomplaining of a throbbing headache and a severe\nstomach upset. We bade goodbye and he hurriedly left\non a donkey cart to catch his bus. I had a quiet\nbreakfast. Half an hour later, on my way to the bus-stop, I heard noises in the hotel lobby. A heated\nargument was in full tempest. The hotel staff were\nmuttering apologies to Calum who was fuming and\nred in the face. The Chinese had assured him that the\nbus would leave on Sinkiang time. It had departed on\nBejing time and was gone for several hours. As things\nstood then, I believe he chose to hitch-hike. That\nwould have taken him through a part of the\nTaklamakan desert. Eager not to miss my bus, I left\nearly and could not find out how he managed.\nMy camera was stolen on the way. Luckily the\nprecious films had been kept separate and remained\nuntouched. I did not discover the theft until late that\nnight, and raised the alarm next morning. Everybody\nin the bus showed concern, including the thief,\nwhoever he was. My neighbour was an ignorant\npeasant who was baffled by my rage and wore an\nexpression of bovine stupidity. The Customs at Pirali\nsearched the passengers but found nothing. The\nChinese police also proved quite incapable of\nretrieving anything and were much frustrated by their\nimpotence. I told them not to worry and made my exit\nfrom their smoke filled room with a smile on my face.\nMy last roll of film was lost with the apparatus. It\ncontained few shots,,but among them were those\ntaken by the Qulfi seller in Kashgar.\nI had brought back with me a bottle of Chinese red\nwine (best drunk when dying of thirst). Taking liqueur\ninside Pakistan was of course illegal. However when\nthe Customs people heard my story of the stolen\ncamera, they were sorry and let me go without\nchecking my gear. I chose to hitch-hike from Sust to\nGilgit. The first jeep stopped after I had walked seven\nkilometers and dropped me off at a village between\nSust and Karimabad. They advised me not to go any\nfurther as it was getting dark. I nodded\nunderstandingly and left with an excuse to pluck some\napricots. Another jeep stopped after three kilometers.\nThe driver was a dubious character. He asked me\nnothing and spoke little. I felt slightly uneasy and lit\nup a cigarette. Soon he stopped the jeep in the middle\nof nowhere. I remembered my Kung-fu lessons well\nand slowly tightened my fists. Now here was a chance\nto give somebody a nose job, I thought. One move\nand I could land a punch in his face, and another\nbehind his ear, in rapid sucess ion. The chap opened\nhis glove compartment, took out a piece of newspaper\nand rolled up some dope. He lit up the joint and started\ndriving. This experience proved to be more hair-raising\nthan riding the roller coaster in the Munich beer\nfestival.\nI started from Karimabad the next morning. A bus\ndropped me off near Rakaposhi. I stared at my\nmountain for many silent minutes and longed to climb\nit. A dozen kilometers further down the road, a car\ngave me a lift. The land journey from Gilgit to\nRawalpindi is long and very tiring. Road conditions are\nregrettably poor. Buses take at least eighteen hours.\nThe scenery is monotonous - a wall of mountains on\neither side, and a river down below.\nWe reached the Swat valley at two o 'clock after\nmidnight, and were stopped at 3 police check post. Apparently bandits lurked in this area. So the\npolicemen who carried vintage Lee Enfield rifles\nassembled a convoy and we departed under armed\ngaur d.A scared driver in the car in front of us\nbrandished a Kalashnikov through his window. If the\nbandits were to strike, he was the first to go. We\nquickly established some distance between us. I took\nturns at driving and we did the stretch in fourteen\nhours flat. I was home in the morning of the twelfth\nof August.\nMost journeys seem to have abrupt endings. This\nrealisation came from all too familiar words. 'Son,' my\ndear mother started, 'you forgot to take your slippers.\nWhy do you keep buying things that you never wear?'\nAzhar AM Abidi\n1. 'News from Tartary'; Peter Fleming.\n2. 'Love in the times of Cholera'; Gabriel Garcia\nMarquez.\n3. After many adventures, Calum is back at college\nin Oxford, and can be found in pubs near Blackwell's. Exploring and sporting expedition leaving England July\nto explore rivers in dug-out canoe; Amazonia. Room\nfour more guns; highest references expected and\ngiven; contact writer via Elec Eng III pigeonholes.\n\n"

    "content": "Deputy Dai's timely warnings\nIllegal Timetabling\nThis is an issue which has generated a lot of publicity\nrecently. It is College policy that no lectures or lab\ntutorials or seminars should be scheduled between\n12.30pm and 1.30pm on Monday and Friday,\nbetween 12.30pm and 2.30pm on Tuesday and\nThursday and from 12.30pm onwards on a Wednesday afternoon. If you have anything\ntimetabled during this time, come and see me\nimmediately. This space is set aside so that you can\ntake part in sports, club activities or humanities\ncourses and, of course, to have lunch. This applies\nequally to undergraduate and postgraduate courses.\nIt has come to my attention that certain departments\n'ask' the class if they 'mind' moving classes to these\ntimes. If they ask you, stand up for your rights. Your\ndepartments cannot force things on you, just don't be afraid to say no.\nExternal Bank Accounts\nThis year I have discovered a number of illegal external\nbank accounts, which I am endeavour ing to close\ndown. There are a number of people who think that\nexternal accounts should be allowed. A tale about one\nof these accounts shows clearly one of the arguments\nagainst them.\nLast year a club closed their account which\ncontained nearly \u00a3750. This money was then,\ntransferred, not to the Union's account, but to the\ntreasurer's personal account. Luckily the treasurer\nwas honest enough to eventually pay the money back\nto the Union, but he could have easily taken a holiday\nin Rio with YOUR money.\nSecurity\nThere is a considerable crime wave hitting the Union\nBuilding and, probably, the rest of College. We are\naveraging two thefts per week of personal property.\nPlease keep your valuables on your person or in a secure place. If you see someone acting suspiciously\ntell security or a Union Officer. It is a problem which\ncannot be easily solved, it needs individual awareness\nand response.\nTo all ladies reading this article; if you have not yet\npicked up a rape alarm then please do so. They are\ncompletely free. If you had one last year; we have the\ngas re fils. Please note, the gas is ozone friendly!!\nDave Williams, ICU Deputy President.\nFiona\nknacker ed less Phew! What a month October was. I never thought\nit was possible to survive on so little sleep...\nParking Permits\nHere is the Appeal and Reserve list for parking permits\ncombined.

Tea and biscuits will be provided.\nThe Postgraduate Group has two objectives:\n1. The representation of postgraduates, at all levels,\nwith ICU and College.\n2, To provide social activities for PGs in College and\nto provide finance for departmental postgraduate\ngroups.\nMembership (free, of course) is open to all PGs\nregistered within College. If you are interested in being\ninvolved in PG affairs, please come along; there are\nseveral vacant positions on the Committee for\nenthusiastic members. If you want to organise some\nactivities within your department, come along and we\ncan give you any help that we can, and possibly\nfinancial assistance. If you have some problem you\nwould like to discuss or ask our help with please come\nalong and talk to us. The PG group needs people to\ncome and tell us about their problems as a PG student\nat Imperial or else we will never know and therefore\nbe unable to help. All are welcome: by helping the PG\ngroup you can help yourself and all the other PGs in\nCollege. Break the apathy and get involved.\nMartin Gans, PGAO.\nDave Williams, ICU Dept Pres.\nTurnip's twaddle\nRon: Two years ago, we went for a break to Guildford,\ndidn't we Ron?\nRon: Yeah, Ron, but there was as po' 'ov b ov ver, wasn't there, Ron?\nRon: There was, Ron 'ad a bi' ov' a run-in w iv' the\nOld Bill.\nRon: They said we were enjoying our Break too much.\nRon: Yes, Ron.\nRon: Who' this blok e in Guildford, then? Cox, I fink\n'is name is.\nRon: I 'erd he's' cox ed' things up this year so we can't 'ave a break in Guildford.\nRon: An' we don't like people who stop us enjoying\na break , do we Ron.\nRon: No Ron.\n-Ron: They seem to get breaks that they don't enjoy,\nRon?\nRon! Right, Ron. I 'erd he plays Rugby....\nRon: ....so they should soon be 'Coxless', an' I don't mean their 1st eight.\nSurrey University have misplaced their UAU spirit\nsomewhere, or someone drank it. More likely\nsomeone poured it down the sink 'cos it was only 5%\nby volume anyway.\nBut I think I 've worked out why this chap Jason Cox\n(their Athletic Union President) is so sore with us. It\nwasn't the sound thrashing doled out on them by\nImperial. It wasn't the boisterous singing in their\nUnion, even though that was awful. It wasn't the bar-diving from the first floor of their split level bar. And\ndo you think we would complain about a fight with\na barman or a shopping trolley through a refectory\nwindow?\nNah, what really p*** ed them off was the fact that\nwe shouted down all the correct answers during their\nUnion Bar Quiz, and then when they finally cottoned\non (which took them some time), we started shouting\ndown all the wrong answers!\nSo that's it. We can't go to their Union this year\nbacause it clashes with a bar quiz. I reckon they'll sort\nit out in two years time.\nAnyway, what sort of Union organises a bar quiz\nin the evening after a UAU game?\nBen Turner, ACC Chairman.\n\n"

    "content": "Kate Bush\nThe Sensual World\nThe first new material from Kate Bush since the\nHounds of Love album of 1985. This is definitely a progression in style. A whole host of musicians have\nworked on this album from ageing rock stars like Dave\nGilmore to young promising classical musicians like\nNigel Kennedy.\nThe result one might think, would be a masterpiece,\nunfortunately this is not. A definite Celtic influence\nis present within her music with instrumentation\ntaking in Celtic harps and Villean pipes. In places the\nmusic is confusing and difficult to follow with aten dancy to sound like it is droning on a little, this\ncould be due to poor production, which on this album\nis in the hands of Kate herself.\nHer childhood appears to be the subject of many\nof the tracks on this album like The Fog and Reaching\nOut and This Women's Work which is the only other\ntrack besides The Sensual World I can see making\nanother single.\nOverall this sounds like one might expect from Kate\nBush. However she does not seem to have captured\nthe magical moments of previous albums such as The\nDreaming or The Kick Inside. I feel this album could\nbe one of those 'better after a few plays' albums.\nWorth thinking about.\nNEML\nSugarcubes\nLast Friday the Sugar Cubes, Iceland's second name\nin entertainment played at the Brixton Academy. The\nsupport group played enthusiastically to a growing\naudience but were only saved from total banality by\nthe sheer volume of their music.\nWhen the Sugar Cubes first came on, things looked\nmore hopeful. Their songs were vibrant and well\ndelivered but then the male vocalist began shouting\nto the crowd in pidgin English which heralded the\ncollapse of the performance. The beautiful lead singer,\ndressed in a sixties mini dress, sang Birthday and\nsounded good, but then began flapping her arms and\njumping around the stage while the male vocalist, in\na vivid yellow shirt, barked into his microphone. The\nkeyboard player was good but her thoughts-seemed\nto be elsewhere most of the time.\nThere were a couple of good songs but it took the\ninspiring theatrical splendour of the Academy to make\nthe evening worthwhile.\nSimon Elliot\nMudhoney\nAll the way from Seattle to 'F**k Up' Mudhoney\nare a lively four piece with an ear for a tune and a penchant for guttural grunts and axe torturing which\nresults in a noise just the right side of musical. There's Blues in there but you'd never catch BB King playing it.\nFlat Out Fucked, Magnolia Caboose Bayshit and\nHere Comes Sickness exhibit a cheerful sense of\nhumour but there is nothing frivolous about the music\nwhich hits hard and fast without de gne rating into the\nwhite noise of hardcore. By Her Own Hand sounds\nPage 4\nlike REM at 78 rpm and there does seem to be some\nsort of songwriting prior to recording as the racket is\ntoo disciplined to be to ally improvised. However,\njudging by their recent gig at the London School of\nOriental and African Studies, when singer Mark Arm\ninvited the audience on stage with him and it promptly\ncollapsed, live performance is total chaos and great\nfun if you like anarchy.\nCDL.\nDe La Soul\nTown & Country Club\nThey're a strange beast, support bands. Sometimes\ntheir sheer energy and joy to be playing outshines the\nmain band and at other times you're gald you stayed\nin the bar, tonight being one of those nights.\nHip-Hop isn't normally my flavour, but at its best\nit's essential and at it's worse forget able. She Rockers\nand Third Base were to me all that Hip-Hop isn't. They\nlooked like they didn't want to be there and spent ten\nminutes each conveying this to the audience with their\nbland delivery, un originality and lame DJs, though this\ncrowd came to party and when told to 'wave your\nfucking hands in the air', they dutifully did so.\nWhen DJ Aitch B( of Soul II Soul) came to the decks\nhe didn't play records, he made the turntables sing.\nAnyone that can play Julie Andrews singing Do Re Me\nto a Stephanie Mills back beat is a serious talent.\nDe La Soul are to me the only Hip-Hop group to hear\n(exceptions being Big Daddy Kane and Ice-T). Their\nsongs are a breath of fresh air to a sound that buries\nitself in repetitive ness. Their sharp use of rap, melody\nand some of the best samples from sixties soul\nclassics lifts them feet above the mainstream. Their\nalbum Three Feet High and Rising being the\nbenchmark of the sound. Their live set conveyed all\nof this but was marred by the fact that one of the\nturntables continually refused to behave and ruined\nat least three of the songs, which out of an eight song\nset just wasn't up to scratch (pun intended), especially\nwith tickets at \u00a39.50 a throw.\nDominic Wilkinson.\nLemonheads\nLick\nThis LP has been reviewed and praised so much that\nit's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said.\nIf, however, you happen to have been sampling the\ndelights of a Mongolian holiday or waiting to get\nserved in Southside Bar it's like this.\nThe Lemonheads third LP nods it's head to the past\nglories of Husker Du and REM then skateboards up\nyour garden path through your bowl of Shreddies and\nstraight down your throat. Having been fortunate\nenough to see this band at the enormous, stylish Art\nDeco venue of the Fulham Gryhound (screams of stop\nbeing such an elitist g it echo around the living room)\nthey transcend the accusations of being plain copyists\nby sheer enthusiasm and lack of p retention. These\ngeeks look so much like geeks they could hardly put\non a 'rock and roll image' if they tried, and luckily they\ndon't( even their hari cuts are crap and we all know\nthis is crucial to success).\nThe only criticism of the Lemonheads is their failure\nto try anything new, but who cares when they sound\nlike they're having one hell of a time going nowhere.\nThe one major problem track on this record is an\nextremly dod gy cover of the Suzanne Vega 'classic'\nLuka. A song which deserves to be dragged screaming\nto the floor and soundly thrashed to within an inch\nof its life. Guess which track was released as a single,\nalthough fortunately rather limited?\nSo if you harbour secret desires to hang around in\nparking lots, chewing gum and watching the tumble\nweeds roll past the deserted petrol station, book a holiday in the USA. If you can't afford this buy the\nLemonheads LP instead. Lemon crush anyone?\nDick Savage.\n\n"

    "content": "HRH sees white elephant\nThe Chancellor of the University of London, Her Royal Highness Princess Anne visited Imperial College on Wednesday. The\nPrincess toured the College's Electrical Engineering department as well as the new Interdisciplinary Research Centres on the South\nKensington site.\nAfter a lunch attended by the Vice Chancellor and ex-rector of IC, Lord Flowers and other notables, she visited St Mary's Hospital Medical School. Princess Anne's last visit to Imperial College was for the celebration of the merger of the College with\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School.\nIRC \u00a30,3m underfunded\nThe most recent of Imperial College's three prestigious Interdiscipliary Research\nCentres (IRC) is already experiencing\nfinancial difficulties and may be over\nbudget by as much as \u00a3300,000.\nThe IRC, in Process Simulation and\nControl, is to be situated in the Chemical\nEngineering department. The costs of\nsetting it up have risen steeply after plans\nfor housing the Centre were changed. The\noriginal plans, which involved building an\nextension on the roof of the Aeronautical\ndepartment, had to be abandoned\nfollowing a surveyors' report which found\nthat the existing building was not strong\nenough to support the weight of an extra\nfloor. New proposals involve using more\nof the existing Chemical Engineering\ndepartment.\nProfessor Sargent, the director of the\nIRC, said that the College was negotiating\nwith the surveyors, Norman & Dobler, to\ntry to reduce the cost of the structural work\nthat was required. He said that he was also\ntalking to both the Science and\nEngineering Research Council (SERC),\nwho are providing the majority of the\nfunding for the IRC, and College\nAdministration in an attempt to obtain\nextra funds. Money is also being sought\nfrom organisations outside College.\nHe blamed the difficulties on the way\nin which departments were forced to apply\nfor IRCs. He said that the grant application\nwas made on the basis of rough estimates\nand a simple study, and that during several\nmonths of discussion about the grant level\nwith the SERC they had still believed the\noriginal scheme for housing the centre on\nthe roof was feasible. The grant was\nannounced in April of this year and the\nsurveyors' report was not received until\nabout a month later.\nBrian Dennis, Imperial College's Building Planning Officer, said that 'all\nthe works that were required were too\nexpensive' and that negotiations were\nprogressing on reducing the cost of the\nbuilding works generally. He said that he\nwas unsure what the final cost would be\nbut that the figure would be 'finalised\nwithin the next month'. He refused to\ndisclose the figure budgeted for the\nbuilding work in the application.\nSome ancillary work has already started\non the Centre, which officially opened on\nthe 1st August this year. Dr Rodney\nEastwood, College Planning Officer, said\nthat it was a 'six to ten year project' and\nthat it was 'expected to take a long time\nto set up'. He said that College was\n'always going to provide funding for some\nof the initial phases', but that SERC was\nproviding 'several hundred thousand for\nthe initial setting up'. The total value of\nthe SERC grant to the IRC is \u00a39.3 million.\nIn his speech at Commemoration Day,\nthe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, said that\n'having three IRCs centred at Imperial\nCollege is a marvellous victory...yet,\nbecause of the restructuring which it\nrequires, the initial impact is to add\nsignificantly to our financial difficulties.\"\nA recent government report has criticised\nthe way in which the IRCs have been\nawarded and set up.\nIssue 8 4 8\nFriday 3rd November\n\n"

    "content": "President, Neil McCluskey writes on the latest progress\non the loans issue and other more down to earth affairs\nBig Mac reports\nHere we have another lengthy report to describe what\nI 've been doing over recent days.\nExternal Affairs\nLoans-The Ongoing Saga\nAll the letters regarding the Price-Waterhouse affair\nhave been written and sent as instructed in the motion\npassed at the last EGM. For those people who did not\nattend, the decision was taken to refuse PriceWaterhouse admission to the Imperial College Careers\nFair. Writing to Price-Waterhouse had a marked effect;\nwithin 48 hours of them receiving a letter, myself and\nDavid Smedley were talking to two of their partners.\nThis meeting lasted 41\n/2 hours and ended with\neverybody having a fairly healthy respect for each\nother. Price-Waterhouse seemed pleasantly surprised\nthat we could conduct a rational, sound argument at\ntheir level. Now that one company has realised that\nwe are reasonable to talk to and hold genuine doubts\nabout the loans scheme working then maybe we will\nbe introduced to others and finally actually get\nsomewhere.\nThe last word on loans for this issue is...\nThe loans scheme will affect you. You will lose your\nrights to benefits. You will be the worst paid person\nin this country (including YTS people!). Get off your\nbottoms, find out about it and do something about it.\nQuestions can be asked of me on this matter at next\nweek's UGM. Thursday 1pm in the JCR.\nThe NUS will be persuading the constituent\nmembers to hold a week of action next week with\nregional demos on November 16th and the London\nRegional Demo on November 29th. Further details on\nthe demos will be available shortly.\nNUS Referendum\nI 've asked the NUS to contact me so that we can sit\ndown and talk to them about the pros and cons of\njoining the NUS. I hope they do eventually contact me.\nThe referendum is likely to be held some time in\nFebruary with a debate on the matter some time in\nlate January.\nPoll Tax\nGeneral Union Council (re reps from each London\nCollege Union) has brought to the attention of its\nmembers that some colleges may be in breach of the\ndata protection act in releasing students' names and\naddresses. I have checked with my sources and I don't think we have a case that will stand up against\nour College. General info on Poll Tax (and how to\nobstruct it!!) will appear shortly. In the meantime, if\nyou're being asked to register; ask as many questions\nof the CRRO as possible, smear butter on the bar\ncode, say you've lost the form, ask for your address\nnot to appear on the public register. Information on\nhow to deal with your landlord with respect to your\nrates element in your rent will be released in February.\nAccommodation\nCommittees concerning student accommodation are\njust starting, so things aren't really happening yet.\nWell, apart from the usual that is...Complaints have\ntaken the usual format ie rents are too high,\nallocations weren't altogether perfect, the halls aren't the best you've seen, Hamlet Gardens is even worse\netc etc. The aspect of rents will be coming up at\nCollege committees soon. I am of the opinion that if\nrents go up any further then students won't bother\nto apply to halls of residence and the residences will\nlose out even further. I also think Olave House is a complete waste of money losing over \u00a3100,000 alone\nlast year!\nFor those in the private-rented sector Yve Posner\nhas put together a housing rights information pack\nwhich is available from the Union Office. I have every\nintention of putting wheels into motion to improve the\nservices for students looking for private flats etc and\nwill be putting a full report to College on my ideas\nshortly.\nInsurance and Security\nOver the last few weeks there have been a number\nof thefts of personal property from the Union Building.\nWe have the difficult situation of students wanting\nsecurity to be better but not wanting want to have\naccess restricted: not an easy problem to solve.\nPersonally I would like to see entry to College and\nUnion premises by valid members and their guests\nonly; this would certainly improve security. A word\nof advice, however: students' personal property is not\ninsured under the Union policy so students should\nthink seriously about taking out their own insurance\nand/or looking after their property.\nVans\nI have received a number of complaints about one of\nthe Union vans (OLE-the big green one) being in a state of disrepair. It is, but this is the van that is due\nto go when the new van arrives. It is pointless paying\nout more money on repairs at this point in time. If\npeople are so unhappy about it then the van will be\nkept in the carpark and not used thus reducing the\nnumber of vans available. I am doing my best to speed\nup delivery of the new van but it's out of my hands.\nWelfare\nThe housing and benefits rights days went extremely\nwell. My thanks to Jackie Scott, Union Welfare Office,\nand Yve Posner, Union Welfare Adviser, for all their\nhard work. The next campaign is due in December and\nits aim will be to promote awareness of overindulgence in alcoholic excess!!!\nParking Permits\nThe permits awarded to those who appealed should\nhave been printed last week but they weren't! They\nappear this week. If I receive any more hassle I think\nI 'll go insane.\nInternational Student Conventions\nI have received information and invites to the\nfollowing student meetings:\n*ISFIT-90, Trondheim, Norway, 17-22 April 1990.\nDeadline for applications 10.12.90.\nENSTA, Paris 16-16 Jan 1990. Deadline asap.\nSemaine Europeene, Paris 19-23 Feb 1990. Deadline\n30.11.89.\n\"Individuals can also apply\nAll of the above meetings are organised free of charge\nand the only expenses to find are travel costs. The\nIndustrial Relations Committee has agreed to put aside\npart of the profits from the Careers Fair to sub sid is e the travel by 40%. In return for the subsidy all we ask\nis that you produce a report on the meeting and that\nyou attend in the capacity of a representative of\nImperial College Union. Applications are invited for\nwhich forms are available in the Union Office.\nInformation on the conventions is available for reading\nin my office but this cannot be taken away.\nFinally, I would like to say a public thank you to the\nCCUs for inviting me to their Departmental Freshers'\ndinners. Those I managed to attend I enjoyed\nimmensely and I appreciated the opportunity to talk\nto academics and students together. The biggest\nthanks must go to the organisers of each dinner, they\nmust have put in a lot of work to make the evenings\na success. On the subject of thanks, I must thank\nFiona Nicholas, the ICU Hon Sec for organising the\nCommemoration Ball, held in the London Dungeon.\nThe event was a storming success and I'm sure\neveryone must have enjoyed it.\n13 Page\n\n"

We already have\n120 paid up members after just two weeks of lessons\nand even more people have turned up to the classes.\nDue to popular demand a second beginner's Rock 'n' Roll class has been set up on Wednesday at 3.15pm in the SCR (Union Building). The jazz is now at 3.30pm in the Union Gym Isee What's On page).\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Dance Club we\noffer lessons in Social Ballroom, Latin American, Rock\n'n' Roll and Jazz at all levels.\nAs well as giving lessons we also offer you the\nchance to compete against other universities. Last\nyear the Imperial College Dance team came second\nonly to Cambridge at the inter varsity competition.\nOn November 17/18 we are hosting a24 hour\nsponsored dance to raise money for the BBC's Children in Need Day. The event starts at 6.00pm on\nFriday in the JCR. Anyone interested in participating\nor wanting more information should contact a member\nof the Dance Club committee. Sponsorship forms are\navailable at all the lessons.\nOne more date for your diary-the Annual London\nBall is being held on December 2nd. Details of this\nevent will be announced in a later issue of FELIX.\nIf you have thought about joining the Club but\nhaven't got around to it yet, it is not too late, just\ncome along to any of the lessons-we would love to\nsee you.\nDebating\u2014Afghanistan\nOn March 6th1989 the religious fanatic group, the\n'Mujahedin' declared 'jihad' (holy war) on Jalalabad.\nBetween March and July 40,000 of their troup s marched on Jalalbad, and the city was bombarded by\n5,000 rockets, causing 973 houses to be damaged\nalong with 150 government buildings, shops,\nmarkets, mosques and temples. The casualties\nincluded 1993 injured, and 1002 killed, half of them\nchildren. It all ended on July 7th, as thousands of\nAfghanistan citizens marched to celebrate victory over\nthe mu jah ed in chanting 'Afghanistan Zindabadl' Hong\nlive Afghanistan) and 'Marg ya Watan' (death or\ncountry). The front has now been pushed back to\nSamarkhel, some 12-15 km further east. Samarkhel\nused to be a tourist spot, renowned fort ts beauty, but\nnow the streets lay strewn with debris from the\ndamaged schools and shops. Could this devastation\nhave been avoided? The Sparticist League thinks so.\nThey argue that the USSR peace keeping force should\nnot have withdrawn from Afghanistan, and are\nprepared to debate their point of view with the British\ncommunist party. They believe that the Mujahedin are\nbacked by the CIA, and are also campaigning for\nwomen's rights to cast off the veil. The debate will\nbe on Thursday November 9th at 1.30pm in Huxley\n341.\nTen Pin Bowling\nLast Saturday (28th Oct), the Ten Pin Bowling Club\nteam played their second match in the University\nBowling League against Southampton University.\nDespite the fact that Southampton have a notoriously\ngood team, our team beat them 6-4. The match was\nvery close throughout but was finally decided on\npintail, over the whole 12 games played. The ladies\nteam especially did very well beating Southampton by\nover 300 pins. This was partly due to a very high\nPage 16\nseries by Katie who played better than most of the\nA team. The A team itself also won against, arguably\nthe best A team in the league. All the players did well\nand Southampton were more than just a bit miffed.\nThe B and C team both came extremely close to\nwinning on several occasions with a difference in one\ngame of only 3 pins. Finally Phil Wren (A team) must\nbe mentioned for the highest series of the match with\na500. Real Ale\nEnterprise\nBy the time you read this we will have had yet another\nsuccessful Real Ale enterprise, namely our trip to the\nGreene King Brewery in Bury St Edmonds. The\nexcursion commenced at the hideously early time of\n12.30pm. Two enthralling, bum-numbing hours later\nwe were in time to be a mere fifteen minutes late.\nThere followed a mind-blowing look at the brewing\nprocess which we all enjoyed. We then had an\nopportunity to sample one or two of the fine ales\nbrewed there except Jon who was driving (hee, hee,\nhee). After some heroic drinking by the rest of the\nexec and other members proving it was possible to\ndrink when standing, walking and talking.\nFilm Soc\n-Croc II\nThis Thursday IC Film Society is showing Crocodile\nDundee II with Paul Hogan reprising the role that made\nhim a star. Luckily this sequel does more than just\nreprise the script of its successful predecessor,\nhowever. This time there is a much better defined\nplot, with Mick and Sue taking on a gang of evil drug\nped d lars. Sure there are still plenty of laughs, but there\nis plenty of action too.\nThe film starts at 7.30pm in Mech Eng 220. 50p to members, \u00a31.50 others. Membership is \u00a35.00, a bargain considering that we will be showing at least\n16 more films before the year is out.\nTrain\nSpotting\nHave you ever felt that guilty thrill as a Greasly 462\nLocomotive thunders past drawing a full passenger\ntrain or the surge of arenal in as diesels shunt and\nthrust in the shadowy sidings of Clapham Junction?\nThen this club could be for you.\nWe are a small but growing group of dedicated\ntrains potters hoping to form a club in direct\ncompetition with Sci Fi Soc. Our aims are to promote\na greater understanding of the British Railway\nNetwork and its locomotives and rolling stock. With\na membership of 15 at present, we currently meet in\nthe Computing Common Room every Wednesday to\ncompare notes and look at each others anoraks. We\nonly need five-more people to form a Onion Society!\nIn the future we hope to visit the Kings Cross\nShunting Yard and the Signalling System recently\ninstalled at Ormskirk Station. With a bit of luck we\nwill be holding weekly spotting competitions; bring\nyour own Clearasil.\nSo far we have two rare Gunthorpe 20 diesels to\nour credit, and we hope to catch a sight of the even\nrarer Bradshaw 482, which uses the revolutionary\nWalschaerts valve gear, next weekend.\nIf you are interested, please give your name to\nMichelle Bigun in the Union Office, or leave a message\nin FELIX box 280.\n\n"

    "content": "Personal Exciting committee letter\nDear Dave,\nJust to prove that the Life Sciences Department\naren't horrible to all of their students, I thought I'd let\nyou know how nice they are being to one in particular.\nSecond and third year Applied Biologists have to do\nplacements, and last year they were forbidden to do\nthem overseas. Because some of the mid-year exams\nlast year were postponed due to the AUT action, some\nthird year Applied Biologists had to revise during the\ncourse of their placement and had to take days off\nto return to London for exams. Not everybody,\nhowever. One enterprising student decided to do her\nplacement in Gambia in spite of the warning from the\ndepartment, and obviously could not be expected to\ntake books with her to revise from, nor return halfway\nthrough to sit exams with the other students. When\nshe finally returned in the autumn (with a nice tan),\nthe understanding Life Sciences Department decided\nto allow her to sit her exams when she'd had time to\nrevise for them-after about a term of College and\nthen at approximately two-week intervals.\nSo may I suggest to all Life Sciences students that\nif you want to have the department on your side, you\nshould learn how to simper and flatter the male\nlecturers-I'm sure you'll be guaranteed a first, but\nwe'll have to check next year's degree lists to find out\nfor certain.\nName withheld by request.\nPlastic man\nDear Dave,\nDelaware not Tupperware!\nUROP really does exist; last week's article was not\na spoof I Opportunities at the University of Delaware,\nand UROP generally, will be described at a meeting\nin Mech Eng 342 at 14.00 on Wednesday 8\nNovember.\nYours sincerely,\nSinclair Goodlad.\nApathy\nDear Dave,\nWhen I came to Imperial I naively believed that\nstudent unions existed to help students, now I am not\nso sure.\nLike most students I did not attend the Union\nMeeting on student loans, I did not know about it until\nI read last week's FELIX, and I doubt that I would have\ngone to it anyway! I was even more surprised to find\nthe news that Price Waterhouse had been banned\nfrom the Careers Fair, tucked away in a sentence at\nthe bottom of the page.\nNow I don't particularly like the idea of loans, what\nsane person wants to be given less money? But there\nare both sensible and stupid ways to fight them. Do\nthe fools that thought up this little scheme really think\nthat banning Price Waterhouse is going to stop loans?\nOf course it isn't, it's only going to make it harder for\nus to get jobs.\nWhat brilliant ideas are they going to dream up\nnext? Ordering all students to cut off both their legs\nso that they become disabled and don't have to pay\nthe Poll Tax?\nYours,\nMichelle Codill, Chem 1.\nDear Dave,\nRe. In response to Editorial of 27 October, 1989.\nAs an ex-student member of the Undergraduate\nStudies Committee IUSC) I must set the record\nstraight concerning your editorial on departmental\nreviews by external assessors:\n1. The USC has 5 student reps (1 sabbatical and\n4 Academic Affairs Officers) out of a group of 16\npeople-the highest prop orton of student reps on any\nCollege committee.\n2. Of all the bodies in College it is the USC that has\nthe greatest commitment to the improvement of\nteaching standards-the very reason for its existence.\nSince its inception in 1985 all of its members have\nworked extremely hard to improve teaching standards\nthough out College and have achieved a great deal\n(though, of course, there still remains much to be\ndone). I am sure, like myself, that these people will\nbe grossly offended by your unwarranted and\nunjustified criticisms.\n3. To suggest that the USC is a censorship body\nis ridiculous. It is they who organise the whole\ndepartmental review process by eminent\nindustrialists, education a lists and academics (who\nduring their visit meet with groups of students to\ngather their opinions). It is an extremely worthwhile\nprocess, bringing many benefits to students in the\nlong run.\nNor is this review process carried out for the\nUniversities Funding Council as you stated-it is done\nto help departments to improve the standard of their\nUndergraduate courses and thus benefit us-the\nstudents.\n4. Yes, representatives of the department under\nreview (including the student Departmental Rep) are\ninvited to discuss the reports of the external assessors\nwith the USC. The purpose is for them to demonstrate\nways in which they are or will be taking account of\nthe assessors and USC's criticisms and suggestions,\nnot to censor bits that they don't like. The discussion\nalso pro v des excellent feedback to the USC on the\nattitude of the department to positive change and\ndraws out many 'problem areas' which the USC is\nable to highlight to the Board of Studies.\n5. Folowing the review process the department is\ntasked by the Board of Studies to go away and\naddress all the c iri tic isms of both the external\nassessors and the USC and to report back on\nprogress.\n6. Overall, the student body has a very significant\nand worthwhile input to the review process-probably\none of the most effective methods at our disposal to\ninduce change. However, this is not the only function\nof the USC-it is active in many areas.\n\u2022 Comprehensive assessment of lecturing\nstandards by College-wide questionnaire which, over\ntime, will have a great impact on teaching standards\n(in this respect we are the most advanced institution\nin the country).\n\u2022 Ongoing work on other forms of teaching\nevaluation and improvement leg tutorial/lab work, self\nassessment/peer review, training for lecturers etc).\n\u2022 Other areas of concern such as student\nworkloads, European qualifications, timetabling,\nde motivation and under achievement, assessment of\nnew courses, failure rates etc.\nThe USC represents a vital resource to which\neveryone, staff and students, should offer their\nwholehearted support.\nRichard A Spencer,\nICU Academic Affairs Officer 1988/89\nUnbiased? Party invite\nDear Dave,\nSince last Easter Joe Cartwright, the Warden of\nWillis Jackson House, has suffered much from\ncriticism voiced through FELIX. Whilst not, in a position to comment on the allegations of fina'nei al mismanagement, as ex-residents of Willis Jackson,\nwe feel that our views on Joe's warden ship are of\nrelevance.\nThe atmosphere in Willy-J was one of relaxed\ncooperation rather than deference to a distant\nauthority. Joe was genuinely concerned and friendly\nto all residents, offering advice and help whenever\nneeded.\nMany social events were organised in the House,\nending with the Willis Jackson Ball, a highly\nsuccessful event, to which Joe was particularly\nconcerned that all residents should come.\nIn short, we were very happy during our year in\nWillis Jackson and would be sorry to see the character\nof this house changed.\nYours sincerely,\nM Hewit-Booman, Grad S Smith, Phys 7\nG Neare, EE2 S Gamett, ME2\nP Wren, EE2 M Cudworth, Mat 2\nC Brown, EE2 A Gregory, Phys 2\nR Bestilleiro, Comp 2 G Bury, Phys 2\nI Morns, Phys 2 A Grace, Phys 2\nP Martin, EE2 S Kohol, Chem 2\nJ Lowther, Chem 2 U Pgial, Chem 2\nDear Dave,\nI note Sinclair Goodlad is operating a Tupaware\nexchange (Felix 847). I have two biscuit containers\nand a swing bin. Would anyone care to swap for a cake dish?\nYours sincerely,\nPaul Shanley.\nVery weird\nDear Dave,\nWith reference to your letter from Mark Whiting last\nweek, I think I clan help. The Guinness heir was the\nlate John Guinness, 2nd Earl of Moyne. He met the\nBeatles in the Cavern Club, circa June 1961.\nI was told that following a row with his father,\nViscount Moyne, he deliberately ploughed his car into\na Charrington's lorry delivering to the Hoop and Toy\nin South Kensington. The accident happened just\noutside South Kensington Station in Thurloe Place.\nWriting of the accident in 1972, John Lennon\nmentioned that 'My Sweet Lord' was dedicated to the\nlate Earl.\nI hope this is of some help.\nYours faithfully,\nSally Hupena.\nPage 18\n\n"

    "content": "Paul Shanley presents\nThe Delator Column\nThe future of education in this country has never been\nin as much trouble than the present time. A number\nof upheavals are taking place which will have far\nreaching consequences for both ourselves and the\nnext generation of students. These changes are a result of both national and local factors.\nA fundamental right of every person should be the\nright to be educated to the best of their abilities\nregardless of their sex, age or creed. This has been\naccepted for years. What has also been accepted has\nbeen the right to be educated irrespective of ones\nwealth. This is a principle that I would label 'free\neducation for all'. Britain, as it heads for the 1990s, is evolving into a society where this principle is slowly\nbeing eroded.\nThis is not necessarily an attack on the present\ngovernment (although my personal view is that they\nbear the brunt of the blame l. It is also an attack on\nmany other bodies, particularly the institutions\nthemselves in not facing up to this.\nThe introduction of student loans looks to be the\nfirst stage in a series of measures designed to make\nfurther education pay for itself i.e. with very little\nsubsidy from the government. In sight is the next\nproposal ; that students will not only pay their own\ngrants but will also be liable for their fees as well.\nOkay, so far no surprises. But let's extend the\nargument a bit further and look ahead.\nIf fees are to met by students, then industry will\nundoubtedly come to the rescue. To a certain extent\nthey do already, in the way of sponsorships.\nProspective undergraduates will look to large\nbusinesses to meet their full costs. It only has to take\none employer to innovate such a scheme and all the\nothers will follow. Once fees have been met, the\nemployers have quite a lot of leverage within the\nuniversities and polytechnics. Indeed, some of the\ncourses that are not so popular now will become even\nless popular. Industry will dictate to students which\ncourse they should major in. An undergraduate\nelecting to study in a course not vocation-related will\nexperience difficulty in finding a sponsor.\nThe next step is for industry to apply clout to the\ninstitutions themselves. Certain courses will end up\nbeing sponsored by large companies, it will not be\nuncommon for departments to have such items as the\nFerranti Solid State course appearing on their\ntimetables. This would be the beginning of the end\nas far as traditional syllabuses are concerned. Smaller\ncourses, like the Humanities options or very abstract\ncourses, may vanish altogether.\nBearing the main brunt of these radical changes will\nbe the arts based colleges. These are already suffering\nfrom smaller and smaller grants each year. In the\nfor see able future, unless a charitable sponsor can be\nfound (as with Sainsbury's endorsement of the arts),\nthese colleges may be forced to close. Alternatively\nthey will become establishments for the elite. Their\nacademic populace will consist of those students who\ncan well afford the fees and can contribute to the\nsolvency of the college.\nAnother financial dagger through the heart for\ninstitutions is the accommodation crisis. With rent\nlevels as they are at the moment in both London and\nmany other provincial cities, it is becoming\nincreasingly hard for institutions in these places to\nattract students. Their only hope is to find more\nresidences. One way is by merger. This has happened\n8 Page\nalready. It will happen again. How long wii l it be before\nLondon University means just that-a single university\nserving the whole of London with each intercollegiate\ncollege specialising in one very small area of study-Imperial College of Physics, Queen Mary School of\nElectrical Engineering etc., each with its student\nintake dictated by housing places available. The other\nhope is that industry provides accommodation for\nstudents. Anyone undertaking a course in Computing\nwill be housed in a purpose built hall courtesy of IBM.\nSound far fetched? It's happened already. Weeks Hall\nwas paid for by Vickers pic on condition that a proportion of their sponsored students be\naccommodated within it.\nThat is one possible scenario if governments (of any\npolitical persuasion) do not place a greater importance\non education and its associated problems in their\nfuture plans.\nBut is government to blame? Are the institutions\nthemselves entirely faultless? Let's now look closer\nto home-at what Imperial College is doing to attract\nmore undergraduates and better standards.\nMy main concern is that this college is becoming\nmore and more postgraduate orientated. There is no\nharm in this but is being done to the detriment of the\nundergraduate population.\nImperial has an abundance of bad lecturers. The\nyoung lecturers, and the ones who take their job\nseriously, are not at fault. By and large, the standards\nthey set are excellent. The worst offenders are the\nNobel and field medallist s who are so wrapped up in\nresearch, they have little or no time for\nundergraduates. They attract research contracts to\nthe college. They spend all their spare time on said\ncontracts, There is no onus on them to lecture\ncon scienc i ou sly because they act almost\nautonomously of the college structure. If the college\ndecides to reprimand them for bad lecturing ( and\nthat's pretty unlikely ), then they will take off to\nsomewhere else that wants them and is more tolerant\nof their teaching deficiencies. An incident of this\nnature happened in Electrical Engineering at the start\nof term. Two lecturers were in competition for a sponsored chair. The one who didn't get the\nappointment promptly left taking all his research staff\nand contracts with him. The section is now suffering\nfrom a severe lack of staff primarily because college\nupset one of its academics.\nThe research contracts recently announced in the\ncollege Gazette seek to back this up. One lecturer in\nBiochemistry has beer v given \u00a3470,000 for three years\nresearch work. That the college has been awarded\nsuch a contract is highly prestigious. Imperial would\nnot dare upset the lecturer involved for fear that he'll\nleave taking his precious work with him.\nWe attend a college which is geared to financial\ngain. The emergence of IMPEL\u2014Imperial College\nExploitation Ltd, IMPACT\u2014Imperial College Activities\nLtd, and the creation of the new post of college\nManaging Director reinforce this.\nWe have an accommodation service which is self-financing. The college insists that residences must pay\nfor themselves and will not be sub sidi sed. If some of\nthe more profitable areas of the college such as\nIMPEL, conference office and bars (all externally\ngenerated income) were made to cover some of the\ncost of accommodation, Imperial as a whole would\nseem far more at t active to prospective\nundergraduates.\nIn conclusion, government must look to education\nas an investment in the country's future-not as a commodity that can be quantified in material terms.\nEducation itself must look at itself in an objective not\nstagnant way. It must adapt and change. Without this\nsort of reform, the education in its present form, under\nthe ethos of 'free education for all', will become\nextinct.\n\n"

    "content": "'\u00a3>' is for Douglas and T' is for Turner. Next week, 'E' please.\nThe Calumny column\nThis week's initial is 'D'. We need look no further for\nscandal than the Royal School of Mines' very own\nMartin Douglas. Over the summer holidays, Mr\nDouglas got wind of an exciting offer that he couldn't let pass by. The Union Bookstore were giving the first\nvideo away free for everyone joining their new video\nclub before the start of term. Mr Douglas rushed off\nto the Bookstore and joined on the spot. The problem?\nMr Douglas does not possess a video recorder.\nRobinson Crusoe of ICU chess club has been\nrandomly selected to be picked on this week. On\nMonday week he disrupted a meeting of Publications\nBoard three times by walking in and out of the room\nto get chess sets. The sets were held in a locked\ncabinet. Undeterred by this, Mr Crusoe ripped the door\noff and helped himself to the contents, which included\na bottle of Grenadine and a packet of digestive\nbiscuits. The Union could do well to examine Mr\nCrusoe's credentials. He has never studied here and\nthe only union card he possesses is a bent one he\n'obtained' from Carl Burgess (ex-union president) in\n1985. Maybe he should be taken on as a crime\nprevention officer, since he has such a fine knowledge\nof lockers.\nNice to see that ICU Hon Sec Fiona Nicholas is\nplaying the field again. She has been spotted around\ntown lately in the company of one very eligible\nbachelor. The gentleman concerned wears 'sexy\nbicycle shorts'. FELIX conducted an interview with Ms\nNicholas on Tuesday regarding her recent sexual\nexploits. When pressed, she revealed that her Romeo\npossessed something that was 'wet at the end'. The\nidentity of Mr X is a closely guarded secret. Nick\nMarley is 19. Mylan Lester is 105 and has never\nplayed the 'biscuit game'.\nFollowing last week's news story of Elec Eng's Professor Turner and the exploits of a phantom\nphotographer, the culprit has crawled out of the\nwoodwork. FELIX has received a letter from 'Red\nGeorge'. This was accompanied by a photograph\n(reproduced here) and a very interesting story about\nthe aforementioned academic. We are currently trying\nto verify the tale, which concerns an incident at the\nstart of term. Watch this space for further\ndevelopments.\nPhysics Dep Rep, Andy Waller had one lemonade\ntoo many at the department's fresher s' dinner last\nweek. The normally reserved Mr Waller could contain\nhimself no longer when one of the speakers started\ngetting boring and promptly subjected him to a barrage of abuse. The speaker? Royal College of\nScience Dean, Professor Jim Barber.\nOn the same topic, a cautionary tale from the Civil\nEngineering dinner. Wendy Kite, Civ Eng Dep Rep,\ntried to get acquainted with everyone present. Her\ntactic was to rush up to unfamiliar faces and\nannounce herself. One encounter is worthy of mention\n:\"Hello, I'm Wendy Kite, Civ Eng Dep Rep, who are\nyou?\". \"I'm the head of department\", replied\nProfessor Dowling.\nACC Chair Ben Turner had an interesting experience\nover the summer. On a trip to a club specialising in\n'adult entertainment', he got involved in some\naudience participation. Live on stage, he performed\nan act of some contortion with a stripper, his mouth\nand a freshly peeled banana. It is rumoured that some\npictures are available of the event. Five pounds to\nanyone providing them.\nFinally, this week, back to Professor Jim Barber. He\nhas explained the reason why he was in such a confused state at the Commemoration day service.\nThe learned professor left his briefcase unattended\noutside his house in an act of uncharacteristic absent-mindedness. The local neighbourhood watch\ntelephoned the police to report a suspicious package.\nThe bomb squad duly arrived at the professor's home.\nIgnoring the protestations of his wife, they proceeded\nto make the parcel safe. Meanwhile, Professor Barber\nreturned home to collect his case and had to explain\nto the boys in blue exactly why he had tried to scare\nthe residents shit less. His appearance at\nCommemoration Day was thus under much duress,\nwhich probably accounts for his babbling state. It also\nexplains why he announced last year's RCSU\nPresident Stephanie Snell as 'Stephanie Snail' during\nthe ceremony. Allegations that the real reason was\ndue to the consumption of half a bottle of Bells\nbeforehand are believed to be completely unfounded.\nCaroline Toynbee\n* Ks: lv J**K s: lv J*7 Page\n\n"
