The thin rectangular lamellae, residue of the life of a myriad organisms, span\nno fewer than twenty five distinct Eons; each one indicated by\nthe unfailing recurrence of the Map of South Kensington. The\nfine-structure, too, has its own\ncharacteristically repetitive\npatterns. Few will be unfamiliar with reproductions of some of\nthose intricately varied forms,\nsuch as those technically-named Priscandal, Brytunrun,\nUgmeet, Sekscandal, Nusdem,\nEntscandal or Cupism.\nStratigraphists have found\nthat the platelets are of a remarkably constant area\n(0.073 m) throughout the first\neighteen Eons. This oc-phase\nwas probably a period of little\nclimatic change. In thep-phase\nthey are larger, but still\ncorrelate well with the associated financial deposits,\nwhich appear as coloured bands\nof faint pink or smudgy grey.\nThe <f phase (twenty-second to\ntwenty-fifth Eons) has exceptionally large lamellae\n(0.128 m), and the finance\nbands change dramatically to a brilliant red. This colour\npersists into the most recent\ndeposit, but the platelets\nrevert abruptly to the size of\nthe original oc phase. A detailed\nexplanation of these extraordinary variations may prove\nthe key to the past and future\nevolution of our planet.\nIncredibly, there is conclusive evidence that the\nFELIX sediments are byproducts of the activities of a quasi-intelligent species which\nis closely related to Man.\nPriests of the cult of the Cat,\nthey toil tirelessly so that it\nwill produce 'news' and\n'comment' for their adherents;\nand these artifacts make up the\nmatrix of fossilised detritus\nin the strata. Socioanthropologists are now sure\nthat there was a real founder-high-priest called Howe, who\nretired (repentant ly?) to a monastic order; and a real\nfounder-editor called Hughes,\nwho disappeared in an enchanted grove of the New Forest. The\nfolk-sagas tell of their\nsuccessors: the Presslords\nHargreaves and 'Curly' Kale;\n'Killer' Kerrod (who instituted\na notorious order of female\nacolytes in the temple of the\nCat); the warrior-editor\nBramley who roused the faithful\nagainst the wicked bird men of\nPhoenix; and many others,\ndown to 'Verbalcontract'\nDowson and 'Publicity'\nWilliams. They are not the\nimaginative creations of an\nunknown Tolkien, but real if\nshadowy figures in their own\narcane 'world.\nOnly the central problem of\nthe real nature of the CatOracle continues to baffle\nscience. What manner of beast\ncan keep on producing this\nendless snowstorm of sense\nand nonsense, triviality and\nprofound it y, information and\nmisinformation, cynicism,\nidealism, benevolence and\nmalice? Is it a Power of\nDarkness or a Child of Light?\nIs it the creature of the PriestEditors, or has it enslaved its\nkeepers? Why does it never age\nor mellow with time? Some say\nit has acquired the pseudo-immortality of a fundamental\nparticle, and could end only by\nthat chance encounter with an\nanti-Felix from outer space\nwhich would radiate its\nsubstance across the universe.\nOthers that one day it will\nfade quietly away, leaving the\nfeline grin behind. No one\nknows: and while the world\nwonders the sediment thickens.\nK.W.( who thus rebuts the\npremature obituary notice\npreserved in Eon II).\n\n"

Some\nwere men of words and little action while\nothers tried to be physically violent. However,\nthe editors, having cat like senses, somehow\nmanaged to zap them where it hurts. These\nbattles were numerous and as varied in vigour\nand style as one can imagine.

My faith in students' behaviour\nas regards the irrational and social responsibility\nwas restored on reading that 3,000 students\nturned out at a Union meeting in Leeds to show\ntheir disgust at the actions of the council\nmembers. By passing a vote of no confidence\nagainst these members and forcing them to\nresign, Leeds' students have set an example\nfor students all over the world. Hurray! lor\nLeeds* students and 'Beware student Leaders'\nis the message.\n*\nIt is rather by coincidence than design that\nthe present edition is coming out on exactly the\nsame day as the first, twenty-five years ago.\nThis is solely due to the fact that our\nvar i typist has been sick for two days thus\ndelaying this issue.\nI hope you enjoy this 'Twenty-fifth\nAnniversary' edition.\nI.

We now know\nabout 'the appropriate channels\nthrough which all sports reports\nshould go', and we now use\nthese channels.\nOur point however, is that\nthese channels were not known\nto us at the beginning of term,\nso we reasoned that the best\nidea was to give them to our\nfriendly sabbatical 'FELIX'\nEditor with whom overall\nresponsibility for this publication rests. It did not seem\nunreasonable that a sabbatical\nEditor should have the time to\ndirect all the articles and\nreports he receives to their\nproper destinations; but alas\nwe were sadly mistaken.\nWe are sure that FELIX\ndoes not take up so much of\nyour time that you cannot afford\na few moments to make the\njourney across the Beit Quad\nto drop a way>var d article in\nthe Union' letter rack.

Judging by the state of\nmany of the articles appearing\nin FELIX we certainly would\nbe unwise to imply any\nmalicious intent on your part,\nbut may we enquire as to the\nwhereabouts of several words\nand phrases missing from our\nletter; in particular that part\nwhere in we recorded your\nremark that sports reports had\nnothing to do with you.

    "content": "FELIX SPORT\nCROSS COUNTRY\nNovember 23rd and another cross country match; this time the\nQMC IV2, moved from January and bringing the rainy season with\nit: there mud was mud a mud lot mud of mud mud. Sadly, because\nof flooding, the course did not have its usual pair of vertical-sided seven feet deep ditches, but still managed to contain\nenough varieties of mud, field,\nroad (with and without mud),\nand mud to keep everybody\nhappy (except possibly the\nlocal farmer whose yield\nof winter wheat was severly\nreduced by some 200 pairs of\nfeet wandering twice across\nhis fields). The ditches having\nbeen removed, the worst\nimpediment to progress was a field of knee-deep mud which\nbrought all ordinary mortals\nnot equipped with snowshoes\nor size 17 feet down to a crawl.\nThe first for IC to complete\nthis IV2 mile course was Steve\nMudlark Webb in 56th place,\nfollowed not particularly\nclosely by Neil Boat at 106th and then Dave Jones, Dave\nHoulbrooke, Rich Harrington,\nWilf Welford (Mike had finished\nearlier), and Alf Gamett who\nhad done something to irritate\nSt. Crispin. A more photogenic\nversion of Ian Ellis finished\nat 176 employing an unexpected\nsprint finish to beat Pad\nDonnelly into 177th place.\nMeanwhile, some twenty\nmiles away in London, Rob,\nPete, Paul and Mr. Isherwood\nwere still awaiting the coach\npromised to bring them to the\ncourse. Their absence was\nenough to loosen our seemed ly assured grip on the John Banks\nTrophy for the first UL college.\nThis was eventually won by a slightly ineligible LSE team,\nalong with bottles of cider\nand other worthwhile mem-en toes. Wednesday saw revenge in\nthe form of crushing defeats of\nboth LSE and Brunei over our\nhome course at Petersham.\nRob Allinson showed the flag\nwell in first place with Paul\nClarke (sans flag) second in\njust over 30 min for the 5 1/3\nmile course: Steve Webb and\nthe real T an Ellis (not Bob\nIgnaciuk i his time) with some\nof the opposition were next in\njust under 31min. Other notable\nperformances were by Pete\nPayne whose return from injury\nwas unfortunately not marked\nby a time of 31min as promised\nfor his first run this season.\nAmong those with a hand in\nthe victory were Tim Davey,\nJ im Rushmer and Andy Fairhead,\nand sundry others.\nThis Saturday last, we just\nstole second place from the\nBank of England in a three-cornered race with HerculesWimbledon over Wimbledon\nCommon. This was all a conspiracy to get us fit for the\nUL Champs tomorrow (hint,\nhint), the IV2 mile distance\nhaving been concealed by\nSteve Webb and Mick Fuller\nwho is said to have left the\ncountry. Rob Allinson, who\nwas also in the know, finished\n4th in 42 min 21 sec with a less well-prepared Ian Ellis\n10th in 45-13. Fourteenth was\nPaul Clarke in 46-05 and 16th and 18th were Roman Halenko\nand Neil Boag in 46-37 and\n46-53. The two Daves J& H, Mike and Pete completed the\nteam in only slightly less\nrespectable times, and Pad\nDonnelly and John Shearer were\nleft to dispute who was first\nnot to finish. The team result\nwas: H W79, IC 190 and B of E196.* There will be a Ladies\nCross Country Race over 2V2 miles at Reading University on\nMarch 8th; anyone interested is\ninvited to contact us.\n*UL Champs tomorrow,\nDec 7, at Parliament Hill, 2p.m. start, everybody welcome.\nLast Saturday saw the return\nmatch against the Met. Police\"\nat Hayes where we fielded a weakened team; Rob Allinson\nwas away, being first score i for UL at Birmingham, and\nseveral others had gone home.\nThis allowed Steve Webb to be\nour first home followed by Ian\nEllis and Paul Clarke. We also\nhad some other runners there\nand were narrowly beaten by a measly 80 points.\nOn Wednesday we had the\nsecond London League race at\nSt. Marys, Twickers. Everyone\nimproved on their time for last\nyear's race with one notable\nexception - D. Payne esq. who\ndropped 6mins.22 sec. Pad has\nhis work cut out trying to race\na woman round from Barts.\nRob Allinson was first home\n(again) in 7th place followed by\nSteve Webb, Ian Ellis, Tony\nWeir and many more runners of\ngreat repute. After the race the\nresults were worked out in\nseveral Youngs Pubs around\nTeddington, Twickenham and\nRichmond (R. Allinson is\nleague secretary) ICI are now\n3rd in Div. 1, IC2 are top on\nDiv. 2 closely followed by IC3\nwho are 3rd. P. Donnelly and\nCo (IC4) are now 14th. The\nevening was rounded off by\nseveral multi colour yawns.\n\u00abocK>ry\nAfter a two week enforced\nlay off, the hockey club\nreturned to the battle field last\nWednesday. Inspired by their\npre-match pep talk IC leapt\nonto the field full of enthusiasm, only to find that our opponents\nhad not turned up. After a very\nlong wait Barts arrived and\nbattle was joined. Fired with\nenergy under the captaincy of\nTim Hansen (all the way from\nPutney), IC just had the better\nof a fairly evenly balanced\nfirst half. However, half-time\ncame with the score line still\n0-0.\nThe second half was only\nfive minutes old when Kim\n(whoops, there he goes again)\nHoulden allowed his winger a bits-too much room and Barts\nscored. At this stage IC faced\nan uphill struggle but Barts\nbegan on a course of self-destruction. They proceeded\nto argue with ever j umpiring\ndecision, argue with each\nother and preferred to mess\nabout rather than play hockey.\nKeeping their heads admirably\nIC quickly gained control and\nthe goal rush started. Dave\nLord scored the first. This\nwas quickly followed by further\ngoals from Jeh 'Sleepy' Bashar,\nTrevor 'Superstar' Tutu and\nIan Mclean (2). Barts did fluke\nanother goal, but IC ran out\neasy 5-2 winners.\nAlthough this was an\nexcellent team performance\nspecial mention must go to\nTrevor Tutu for a devastating\ndisplay at centre forward. The\nBarts defence had great\ndifficulty in marking him,\nparticularly in the second half,\nonce darkness had begun to\nfall.\nTeam: Roger Hutson; Jim\nMarshall, Richard Cameron;\nKim Houlden, Keith Arrowsmith\nChris Hodge; Dave Lord, Ian\nMcLean, Trevor Tutu, John\nAndrews (Capt), Jeh Bashar.\n2nd XI\nAfter a long respite, due to\nthe inclemency of the weather,\nHarlington's pitch G again\nsuffered the onslaught of the\n2nd eleven hockey sticks. Our\ngullible opposition was the\nNational Physical Laboratory's Nth team (where N is any\nnumber between 2 and 5).Our\ncaptain (Read I) had quite a lot of difficulty selecting the\nteam as we were equip ed with\nfive full backs, four wing\nhalves, two inside forwards\nand a goal keeper but eventually he managed to sort out\na more conventional formation,\nby persuasion, argument and\nforce. He, himself, delegated\nReed E. to Umpire the second\nhalf and decided to umpire the\nfirst half himself. A wise move\nas he was obviously still\nsuffering from the after effects\nof Linstead Hall party.\nAfter the usual, see how\nmany injuries you can inflict\non the goalkeeper before we\nstart session, play was commenced and IC went immediately\non to the offensive. Though\nNPL looked dangerous on the\nbreak IC always had the whip\nhand with Chris parker dominating midfield in the\nunaccustomed position of\ncentre half, and it came as no\nsup rise when Pete Nowell\nscored. NPL counter attacked\nbut John Huckle, Shane Mead\nand the inscrutable Tan held\non well in defense and our\nopponents were thwarted.\nAfter a half time team\nreshuffle the formation began\nto look a bit saner and once\nmore IC dominated the match.\nPete Nowell completed his\nwell deserved 'Jug' at the much\nmaligned position of left wing,\nafter a series of goal-mouth\nscrambles. At the other end of\nthe field IC conceded a short\ncorner from which NPL were\nlucky to score a goal after the\nball had ricocheted off a defender's stick over the\ngoal keeper's head and an\nincoming forward was able to\nknock the ball past the covering\nfull back. So the score at the\nfinal whistle was 3-1 to IC.\nThe after-match festivities\nwere much enlivened by Read I finally buying the jug which\nhe has owed since die first\nmatch of the season. With Pete\nand Bruno (yes, that is his\nname) Speed still to provide us\nwith jugs, next week's fixture\nshould be memorable.\nTeam (first half positions):\nN. Harrison, S. Mead. J. Huckle,\nE. Reed, C. Parker, Y. Tan,\nD. Balderstone, A. Cresswell,\nP. Nair, N. Bell, P. Nowe'll.\nUmpire: Read I. "

    "content": "FELIX1125 years of Residence\nDave Salisbury THE EDITOR of this illustrious publication now in Anno\nFelicis XXVI approached me with a view to extracting an article\nfrom my think-tank. Naturally my subject was to be nostalgic or\nat least about the life in a somewhat younger IC. Hence I decided\nto write about Selkirk Hall and Beit Hostel, these being the only\ncollege accommodation for\nstudents in 1949.\nSelkirk Hall to many\nprobably means that part of\nSouthside on the upper right\nlooking from Princes Gardens\nbut 25 years ago Selkirk Hall\nwas a house in Holland Park\nnumber 50 to be specific. This\nhouse was bought largely due\nto the generosity of a Mr.\nWilliam Selkirk. He had spent\nhis life in a mining en vi ro ment and had grown quite\nwealthy from his work. He\nwished to establish some\nmining scholarships and while\nMr. G.C. Lowry (the Secretary\nof the college at the time) was\ntalking to him the subject of\nresidential accommodation was\nbrought up. As a result of this\nMr. Lowry persuaded him to\ndonate \u00a317,000 to the Centenary\nAppeal Fund, In view of this\nthe house was named Selkirk\nHall and Mr. Selkirk later had\nan Hon. ARSM and FIC\nbestowed on him.\nThe Wardens of the Halls\nwere Mr. Lowry 1945-51, Mr.\nRSHG Thompson, Maths Dept,\n1951-59 and lastly Mr. C.C. Seaford (the Domestic Bursar)\n1959-1961 when the house was\nsold to Unilever for the sum of\n\u00a330,000 which was put to the\nSports Centre.\nSelkirk Hall had five single\nand five double rooms for\nstudents, the warden lived on\nthe ground floor. A cook for the\nfifteen students was employed\nexcept for Saturday nights.\nStudents signed a book for\nwhen they required a meal.\nThe fire escape system in\nthe Hall was rather rudimentary and consisted of coils\nof rope which students would\nhang out of a window and climb\ndown. This very convenient\nsystem was used only for late\nlate nights (or early mornings).\nThe Selkirk Hall tie incorporated a brick in its design.\nThis brick is due to some\nstudents permanently acquiring\nat least one from a building\nsite nearby. The brick was\npresented to wardens wives\nwhen they made a'fa use pas'\n(or to those who are ignorant\n'when they put their foot in it').\nThe tie has a gold brick\nalternating with the College\ncrest on a dark blue background.\nBeit Hostel, as it was first\ncalled, had its org in s in a pamphlet entitled 'Scheme for\nthe development of Residential\nHostels in connection with the\nUnion of the Imperial College\nof Science and Technology\n1924'. This pamphlet considered the lack of residential\naccommodation in universities\nand colleges to be an obstacle\nto the social life of the college. Even the UGC report of 3rd Feb. 1921 acknowledged this\nin Section 12 'Provision for\ncommon lite and intercourse is\na condition of the highest value\nin a University education'.\nOne wishes that they would\ngive the college some money\nnow to build Northside and\nfinish off Eastside so more\nstudents can live in, but that\nis present day not 25 years\nago.\nThe Hostel Committee of\nthe Governors decided to erect\na hostel 'between the western\nend of the Union and the new\n(at that time) Botany buildings'.\n56 students were to be resident with a weekly rent of 15\nshillings. The building was to\ncost \u00a316,000 which came from\nUnion events. RCSA, RSMA\nOld Centralians, UGC and Sir\nOtto Beit who gave \u00a310,000.\nThe Hostel was opened on\nTuesday April 26th,1926 by\nLady Beit with 20 C&G,15 RSM and 14 RCS inmates\naccommodated in 52 study\nbedrooms on seven floors.\nIn pamphlet in 1927 the\nHostel was judged to be a success and considered that\nmore accommodation should be\navailable. There were two\nschemes, one to add two floors\non to the Union building (which\nat the time was only ground and\nfirst floor), the other New Beit.\nThe former was abandoned (yet\nagain financial reasons) and\nNew Beit was erected.\nNew Beit was finished in\n1931 and occupied the first,\nsecond and third floors of the\nbuilding. The Union had some\nrooms on the ground floor for\nits use. The cost was \u00a387,945\n16s.6d. In 1957 twenty five\nextra study bedrooms were\ninstalled on the third and\nfourth floors.\nOld Beit, when originally\nput up, did not have any\nkitchens as the Union building\nprovided meals for the inmates.\nThe kitchen on the third floor\nwas for staff and the fourth\nfloor a sick bay. New Beit had\na Senior Common Room on the\nthird floor and finance and\narchives sections occupied the\npresent wardens flat. The sub-wardens flat was the wardens\nand before that the warden just\nlived in whichever room he was\nin at the time of appointment.\nThe second floor did not have\nthe present false ceiling and\nthe decor was a lovely dark\ngreen and cream throughout the\nbuilding. Still on how the\nbuilding used to be, the present\nlounge was the Union Bookstall run by a Miss Larkcom,\nthe Bot/Zoo common room a full-time snack bar, the small\nsecurity room used to lead\nstraight into what was the\nmiddle Union office, even the\nRector had an office on the\nsecond floor.\nStudents often used to be in\nBeit for two years and sometimes three because they were\nsuch an extrovert lot. Mr.\nIrving remembers police were\noutside Beit, (and therefore\ntargets for water bombs) which\nled to a Superintendent and his\nmean ie men chasing the\nstudents. The police were\nturned out of Beit on the promise\nthat Mr. Irving would stop the\nwater. Just as he was speaking f to a superintendent five gallons ^\nwere emptied on them! To quote\n'He was a bit more difficult\nthen'.\nThe Hostel was mixed but\nby floors rather than haphazardly as now, which led to\none student climbing up QA\nHouse to view the girls in the\nfloor above. He was subsequently flung out!\nIf you turned up late at night\nthe front gates to the quad\nwere locked but a night watchman on the front of Botany\nwould let you in and one\nemerged through into New Beit\njust by the telephone kiosk.\nBeit Quad in its present\nform was laid out by Mike Neale\nPresident of ICU in 1957, when\nthe hard tennis courts were\nfinally removed. Letters to\nFELIX at the time, often\ncomplained of the eyesore of\nthe rusty nee ting around them.\nBeit Hostel was run by Miss\nSherwood who was the Hostess\nand she performed the duties of\nhousekeeper and more with\nother College duties. Jahn\nOwen would clean shoes for\n6d., sponge and press suits for\n1/6d. What more could one want\non a rent of a couple of quid\nper week?\nMy thanks for help with this\naffront to decent English must\ngo to Mrs. Pingree of Arcnives\nand Mr. Frank Irving the\nWarden of Beit.\nSENNET UNDER PRESSURE\n(From FELIX No. 221. November 1965.)\n\n"

I 've never\ngone a bundle on their choreography but,\noh, those costumes. Clearly not for those\nafflicted by high blood pressure, the\ngirls' costumes for the first dance comprised topless black dresses with only\nstrategically placed stars to hide their\nblushes.\nTurning to the music, Fanny, the\nAmerican all-girl rock group, played a short but neat set lasting about 35mins. Their first album I liked, but the\nreplacement of two of the original band\nmembers by Patti CSuzi's sister') Quatro\non quit ar and Cam Davis on drums has,\nin my opinion, turned the band into\nsomething very ordinary and predictable.\nJune Millington (bass) and Nickey\nBarclay (keyboards), both of whom have\nbeen with Fanny from the start, played\nadequately but there i still seemed to be\nsomething missing.' Perhaps if Patti\npayed more attention to her playing and\nless to making erotic gestures with her\nguitar, then things might improve.\nOf course, most people only came to\nhear Tull, and they didn't leave dis-appointed. Surely Jethro Tull must always\nhave been one of the most entertaining\nlive bands around and this occasion was\nno different.\nTo be voted the world's best flautist\non five occasions is certainly no mean\nfeat, but lan Anderson always gives such\na superb performance. Ably supported\nby 'Stripey' Jeffrey Hammond \u2014 Hammond\n(to the power n) on bass, Martin Barre\n(guitar), Barriemore Barlow (drums) and\nJohn Evan, dressed in his eternal baggy\nsuit, on keyboards, the Anderson-led\ngroup are so much together. Their stable\nline-up must have a lot to do with this.\nThe band are heavily committed to the\nidea of the concept album (indeed the\nlast four have been of this type) but this\nseems to present few problems with their\nlive gigs \u2014 they are well able to condense\na long work into something more suitable\nfor a concert. Of their best works, Thic)<\nas a Brick must rate highly and a shortened version of this was warmly\nappreciated by the audience.\nI think most people were well satisfied\nw j th the large number of the old favourites\ninterspersed with some new songs from\nthe War Child album. The famous Anderson\ndirty jokes and cracks were appreciated\ntoo.\nTo those of you around a couple of\nyears ago who saw Tull at the Albert\nHall, this concert was just as good. To\nthose who missed it, bad luck.\n!C0AD8\nRi zSh a kir Link Wray: The Link Way Rumble\nPolydor Super 2391 128\nThe album kicks off with pounding\nguitar playing; has a distinctive style\nand rhythm which makes it 'Link Wray'.\nSide one initiates with_ 'It Was A Bad\nScene' which is rock '*h' roll with a difference in so much as that it has a rock and roll rhythm but has ingenuous\nguitar play integrated into it, thus adding\na new dimension to classical rock and\nroll. Incredibly so since he has been\naround for sometime now and has seen\nsuccess but has had his share of failures\nas well.\n'Good Time Joe' (the second track),\nin some ways portrays his life-story and\nis obviously the work of a man with\ntalent. This is followed by 'Walkin'\nBulldog' and '/ Gof To Ramble'.\nThese two tracks highlight the exceptional support by his back-up musicians. The\nlast track (on side one) 'Backwoods\nPreacher Man' features good mixing,\nwhich is not always apparent on superficial hearing, however, subsequent\nlistening underlines the necessity of this\nfor this extraordinary piece of music.\nThe second side continues in the\nsame vein with 'Super 88' giving yet\nanother surprise and showing the tremendous versatility of the musicians.\nMark Jordan's piano playing on this track\nalmost succeeds in attaining the same\nunique quality as Link's guitar playing.\nYet again Link succeeds in mustering a new quality into 'She's That Kind Of\nWoman', (the next song) this being the\npenetrating and perceptive lyrics which\nare so direct that at times one feels\nuneasy.\n\u2022Step This Way' and 'We Said I Do'\nare somewhat slower moving songs,\nhowever, this \u00a3>y no means is a retrograding statement and is in fact a compliment to Link's band. The album\nfinishes with Link's infamous 'Rumble'\nwhich has the effect of 'adding the cherry\nto the cake'.\nThroughout the record one cannot but\nbegin to imagine the formats of the\nfollowing songs. This does not imply\nthat the record consists of a random\nselection of songs and is in fact in no\nway incoherent. In addition to Link's excellent guitar playing there is some\noutstanding performances by the individual members of the band who by no\nmeans are overwhelmed by Link and\ncomplement his style. The musical\narrangement is extremely good (although\nnot the best in the world) and Mr. Wray\nis to be both congratulated and credited\nfor harnessing such a wide range of\nmusical ability in a controlled manner\nand utilising it exceptionally well.\nA record to be highly recommended.\nAndrew Osborne Chicago and All That Jazz (Verve).\nA DOUBLE album containing twenty\nnine tracks of what can loosely be called\ndixieland jazz. And fine stuff it is too!\nJazz standards such as 'Chicago',\n'Ain't Misbehavin\", and the omnipresent\n'Saints' are featured, but less familiar\ntunes are played with equal effect.\nThe records consist of three sessions\nthe first of 'Max Kaminsky All Star\nDixieland' recorded in 1953, the second\nof Eddie Condon and his boys recorded\nin 1958 and the last of Eddie Condon\nand the others recorded in 1961. Considering their age the recordings are of\nexceptionally high quality although, of\ncourse, they are in mono.\nThe tracks are of amazing variety,\nthe mood varying from tant ali singly sedate\nto completely riotous but throughout the\nthree sessions an incredibly relaxed\nfeeling comes across as though the\nmusicians were just amusing themselves\nin their own front room,\nmm lt is perhaps injudicious to single\nout any particular track or musician but,\nmerely to fill out this review, I 'll mention\nmy favourites. 'After You've Gone' from\nthe 1961 recording shows Jack Teagarden's trombone playing and singing\nat their best. 'China Boy' from the same\nsession features some excellent piano by\nJoe Sullivan and Pee Wee huss el's remarkable clarinet style runs throughout\nthe 1961 recording. Sr. Louis Blues from\nthe first session Is taken at breakneck\nspeed with Rex Stewart's cornet out-standing.\nI would recommend this album to\nanybody Jazz-buff or otherwise. It could\ngive you something to play at parties\nContinued on page 18\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 15\n'Twenty\u2014 FENCING G five\n^Years of...\nAS AN excuse to remind FELIX readers of Fencing Club's recent spectacular achievements, such as winning our section of\nthe London League, being awarded the Links cup for being the\nmost improved club in college, having had a most enjoyable tour\nof Paris last spring and having such notables as Julian Tyson,\nFencing on Beit roof before the gym was built.\nGLIDING G LUB IN 1949, at the age of 19, ICGC was already one of the oldest\ngliding clubs in the country and had achieved quite a good reputation for itself. However, 1949, heralded a m'ajor and very\nsignificant development in club history. It was the year we\nbought our first two-seater glider. Up and until this time all our\npilot training had been done\nby the 'solo method', i.e. you\nwere tied into the glider and\nthen towed behind a car while the instructor ran along side shouting encouragement and\ninstructions. With the advent\nof the two-seater T21 'Daisey'\nthe instructor was able to fly with his pupil and hence\ntraining was significantly\nimproved.\nThe club has thus continued\nsteadily, always trying to improve its fleet of aircraft and\nencouraging as many students\nas possible to be capable of\nflying them. Basic training and\nearly solo flying are done\nthroughout the year at our base\nairfield at Lasham, near\nBasingstoke. This site offers\nexcellent facilities including a club house, a bar, a TV room\nand a bunkhouse accommodation\nat 20p per night. For the more\nadvanced pilots we have\norganised summer expeditions\nto different parts of Europe,\nand we have flown in Austria,\nGermany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. This\nyear should see a Christmas expedition to Scotland and\nsummer expedition to France.\nThe club now operates\nthree single seater gliders all\nof which are capable of either\nlocal soaring or cross country\nflights in excess of 180 miles.\nTwo of the fli der s are also\nequip ed with oxygen for high\naltitude flying and last year\nsaw our 'Dart' climbing to\nover 17,000feet above Scotland.\nThe picture shown is quite\na typical example of a glider of\nthe late 1940's. At that time\nflights of over 100 miles were\ngreat achievements where as\ntoday 300 miles is quite\npossible and heights of over\n40,000feet have been achieved.\nThe gliding club continues\nto be very active and we\nusually go en masse down to\nthe airfield at weekends,\npreceded by meetings every\nThursday at 1745h in Aero\nEng 254 for lectures, films and\nto arrange transport.\nAlthough the price of\ngliders has gone up from \u00a3800\nin the case of Daisey to near\n\u00a34,000 for a Dart it is still\ncheap to learn to fly with the\nsubsidy from the Union.\nfinalist in two weapons in the\nBritish University Championships and Roman Gormez,\nwinner of the Lamington Spa\nOpen International and participant in the World Championships, we decided to look\nback at our achievements in\nFELIX'S lifetime.\nPaging through FELIX\nback numbers, ignoring Soccer\nclub moaning about having to\nplay barefoot on their tour of\nKenya, and the serious crosscountry club reports (not PA's like what Pad and his mates\nare), not to mention ideal\nbicycle contests, 'Your Hop\nDiary' and 'Nelson's Column',\nwe found, sup rise,s up rise \u2014 in\nthe spring of 1950 Fencing\nclub toured Paris. (The rather\nvague account of what actually\nhappened seemed to indicate\nthat tours of Paris have not\nchanged much over the years).\nThe following years saw\nvaried activity, including\nmatches against such exotic\nsides as the Cambridge Cutthroats (drawn\u2014not blood),\nSalle Paul (lost) as well as\nthe usual university rivals such\nas Kings and UC\nBut it was in 1955, the same\nyear as IC student, Frank\nIrving, flew the first ever two\nseater glider flight across the\nEnglish Channel, that IC\nFencing club, under Captain\nKnill (now President of the\nclub) boast of their best season\nfor a long while, with an\nunbeaten Sabre team.\nBut times .change. In 1956,\nVictor Mooney becomes\ncatering manager. Vickers\ndonates Weeks hall. The\nempire begins to crumble. And\nFencing club goes into a decline.\nOnly the election of Kay\nNickelson to the post of\ncaptain in 1970 saves the ci ub.( Causes much trouble, she\nbeing the first ever female\ncaptain of a ACC club. Her\npot in the union is untouched\nas she is not allowed in the\nunion bar, and she opts out of\njoining Stoats Club). The\narrival of Julian Tyson,\nLawrence Boyd and Steve\nThompson (remember the sheep\nfreak?) results in our winning\nthe B section of the London\nLeague in 1972-73, and thanks\nto their enthusiasm the club\nonce again gets off the ground\n1973-74, another good year,\nincluding a tour of Paris,\nsecond in the whole London\nLeague and numerous personal\nand club achievements.\nBut 1974-75 promises to be\nan even better year. Led by\nour gallant captain Richard,\nand having a record number of\nenthusiastic beginners as well\nas the tal anted experienced\nfencers, we should do well.\nAlready we have appeared on\nSTOIC \u2014 a very professional\nperformance from Julian with\nKay looking pretty, but not\nbeing able to get in much of a say. So an invitation to al\ninactive fencers to join us\neither in the Gym on\nWednesdays and Thursdays or\nthe Union Bar (?) on Friday\nevenings.\nFinally, it is only fitting,\nnow that we are once again\nestablished to thank those who\nsupported the club in its\ndarker days, especially Akos\nMoldovanyi, the Hungarian\nprofessional who has taught\nat the club for longer than he\nprobably cares to remember.\nMany thanks to them for\nkeeping the club alive and\nhelping it to what will\nmost certainly be an enjoyable\nand exciting future.\nA typical example of a glider of the late I940's.

A battle\nthen commenced between three Mihes men and one RCS man.\nSMOKING CONCERT\nRichard Waring\nAS USUAL those brave enough to venture onto the Concert\nHall stage had to face bar ages of heckling from the audience\nwhich, again as usual, contained a high proportion of Guildsmen\nfor an RCS event.\nThe show kicked off in high gear with a sketch from Maths II\n'Professor Laithwaite, you are\ncharged with breaking Newton's Third Law of Motion \u2014 how do\nyou plead guilty or very guilty'.\nThis was followed by the\nMagic Roundabout Sketch which\nwon the barrel a couple of\nyears ago. Not as polished a performance as before (witness\ncardboard not real guitar for\nDylan). Next was the Guilds\nsketch. I didn't catch the title\nbut it probably was something\nlike: 'Pooftahs (as fairies) in\nvague Shakespearian terms also\nusing as many Shakespearian\ntitles as possible'. Though I suppose Charlie Wrigley in\ndrag was some consolation.\nChemistry Seven (all one of\nhim) gave a commentary on a test-match. How many innuendoes did you spot? 1 lost\ncount but maybe it's my filthy\nmind! Then there was the\nstripper who was good.\nAfter the interval there was\nthe drag artist, who wasn't good.

The following\nsketch from Maths I was rarely\naudible above some very\npersistent heckling.\nSomewhere along the line\nI have neglected the Physics\nII Cinderella sketch and the\ninter CCU quiz sketch. Then\nthere was the RCS executive\nsketch and finally the tube\nstation innuendo from Chemistry seven again. Then the stripper\nappeared again for a final\nreveal all with able assistance\nfrom two other gentlemen.\nFinally, Pete (where's my\ny fronts) Teague led RCS in a Kangela which, for once, was\nnot drowned by the Boomalaka-r after all, it was an RCS event.\nPity then in a way half the\nbarrel went to Guilds while the\nother best sketch was judged\nto be Maths II.\nhowever, due to the overwhelming odds this was short\nlived and thus the oar was\nacquired by the RSM.\nMeanwhile the real battle\nhad begun in the foreground of\nthis almost unseen skirmish\nand missiles of virtually\nunaccountable types started\nto fly across the air. Initially\nlaunching a 'lightening' fast\nattack C&G caught the RCS\nand RSM ranks by surprise.\nFor a time it seemed that it\nmight be all over in a matter of\nminutes but RSM and RCS\nsoldiers started to offer increasing resistance.\nAt first they held their own\nagainst the onslaught from\nGuilds' forces, and then\n(having regrouped behind the\nI ines) they launched a concerted\ncounter attack. This caused\nchaos in the Guilds' ranks and\nthe order among their troops,\nbroke down. This was followed\nby a 'ding dong' battle; at one\npoint one side seemed to have\nthe upper hand but moments\nlater the opposition seemed\nto be getting a strangle hold.\nThe order was restored\nwhen the three CCU presidents\nagreed to have a ceasefire.\nProceedings were brought to an\nend with a' fu g of war' contest\nwhich the RSM and RSC\ncommandants won conclusively.\nJenny Jones claimed a victory;\nJohn Mortimer claimed a draw\nand Pete Teague claimed a victory, promptly adding that\nthe other two sides should do\nthe same.\nThe\nraces\necu. results of\nwere as\nRace\nthe boat\nfollows:\u2014\n1.

Nevertheless Dramsoc continued\nundaunted, occupying what is\nat present the Union Office and\nICWA lounge, for at this time\nthe Union building was only\ntwo floors in height. For the\nnext few years the musical\nside of the society declined,\nthe electrics were condemned,\nand in 1940 the society was\nreinstated as ICDS. In 1945\nthe stage was again modified\nand during the next few years\nthe society was brought into\nfull swing again.\nIn 1949 (at last!!!) Dramsoc\nproduced two plays: 'A Murder\nHas Been Arranged' (Emlyn\nWilliams) from March 21st to\n23rd and the Christmas show\n(7th10 th December) 'Much\nAdo About Nothing' (Shakes-pe are); chairs had to be\nborrowed from the Royal Albert\nHall and tickets were about\nsix shillings (30 noddy pence-which compares very well with\ntoday's price of 40 pence).\nWith in ten years the society's existence was again disturbed,\nfor the extension of the union\nbuilding, and a few productions\nwere held outside college.\nHowever, in 1956 the new\nbuilding was opened and the\nsociety occupied the new\nConcert Hall, which contains\nan extremely well equipped\nstage (compared with some\nWest End theatres), dressing\nrooms and a storeroom which\nacts as headquarters of the\nsociety. The first production\nunder the new. roof 'Loftur'\n(Sigurjonsson) reputed to be the\nfirst performance of the play\nin English. The production was\nin conjunction with the Comus\nPlayers (who are I believe\ncurrently in revival); the next\na double bill of 'Trial by Jury'\n(Gilbert & Sullivan) and\n'Sganarelle' (Moliere) was with\nthe Musical Society.\nMore recently technicians\nhave been continual ly modifying\nand improving equipment and\nthe Society has put on such\nplays as 'Arsenic and Old\nLace' (Kesselring), 'The\nTaming of the Shrew' (Shakes-pe are), 'Under Milk Wood'\n(Dylan Thomas) and more\nrecently 'Murder in the\nCathedral' (T.S. Eliot) produced in the Great Hall.\nLast Christmas we produced\n'Camino Real' by Tennessee\nWilliams which was an awkward\nplay both technically and\nartistically. Easter saw 'As\nYou Like It' (Shakespeare)\nwhich was also taken on tour\nlast summer (see an earlier\nFELIX). This term's is a complete contrast \u2014 a double\nbill of plays by Tom Stoppard\n'The Real Inspector Hound'\nand 'Albert's Bridge'.

Three\nmatches and three victories\nlater I see no reason to revise\nthis view.\nOur first match of the\nseason against Sussex University produced a51 victory.\nThis was a most encouraging\nstart as IC has not won so\nconvincingly as this against\nany side for over eight years.\nThe result could be construed\nas a reflection more of the\ndecline in Sussex University\ngolf than a great IC performance,\nthough anyone familiar with\nthe IC lineup of How Rosser\n(Capt.), Bill Calderwood, Bob\nAllan, Nigel Foster, John\nMendonca and Ed Clutton would\nappreciate the formidable test\nSussex faced.\nIf the reader doubts the\nquality of our win against\nSussex our second victory by\n4-2 over University College\nshould quash these once and\nfor all. Last year in one of our\ntwo defeats University College\nbeat us 4V41 V5 and this year\ntheir team was virtually\nunchanged. Bill Calderwood\nand Ed Clutton were our two\nvanquished members, in the\nformer case beaten by a brilliant display by the London\nUniversity Champion Robin\nEllis who started by going 3\nunder par for the first 6 holes\nwhich left Bill little chance\nof recovery. Two UC players\ngave up to IC's Bob Allan and\nMike Strickland whilst Nigel\nFoster and John Mendonca had\nto struggle to win 3 and 1 and\n1 up respectively.\nBy the third match with our\ntails in the air, the side now\naccelerated. Portsmouth Polytechnic were unfortunate to\nmeet us in this mood and were\nbrushed aside contemptuously\n6-0. It was hardly a match so I shall not discuss it except to\nsay that Richard Waddilove was\nrecalled to the team for this\nmassacre.\nOur London University\ncontingent this year must\nsurely persuade even the most\ncynical reader that this is a unique year. In my preview I described the fact that last\nyear no fewer than six of the\nLondon University team came\nfrom IC was a record for any\nindividual college. It is a source of amazement to me that\nalready this year twelve IC\nmembers have been capped for\nthe University doubling the\nrecord we established last\nyear. Indeed many of our future\nopponents have written to say\nthat they believe their team to\nbe exceptional with two\nUniversity players! Our reply\nthat we could field two teams\nof only University players\nthey have regarded as fiction.\nThat they are fools we hope\nthe remainder of the season\nwill prove as convincingly as\nthe beginning.\n\n"

Eng. ft.\nA typical example of their\nbenevolent thoughtfulness was\nrealised only in these past\ntwo weeks.\nThey saw a need and acted\npromptly, bringing a welcome\nearly cheer to IC lectures. The\nfortunate victim of this kindly\nact was none other than\nProfessor John f Hitch up-my-trousers) Brown, the Head of\nDepartment of Electrical\nEngineering.\nThe need was observed\nduring the first seven weeks of\nterm and at last our hearts\n(or sarcasm) convinced our\nheads that it was time to act.\nWith Christmas approaching,\na quick whip-round was made\nbetween two of our morning\nlectures (when it was mistakenly hoped that everyone\nwas present), and the appropriate Christmas present was\ndecided upon.\nWith the mission underway,\npractical and tutorial sessions\nwere overruled, and on that\nafternoon, a group of eight\nnoble Elec. Eng. stalwarts set\noff from the JCR on the long\ntrek southwards to Harrods on\nBrompton Road, armed with a case full of Vip, 1 p and2 p coins. After nearly turning into Princes\nGardens we finally corrected\nour bearings which took us on\na pleasant walk through the\nnews and around Brompton\nOratory and on to our destination where our numbers\nincreased by one (on his way\nto morning lectures ?!). A quick and direct march to the\nrelevant shelf was followed by\na rather less speedy purchase.\nAn article of the desired\nnature and price was chosen,\nwhereupon the already bemused\nshop assistant (having heard\nabout our Professor's indiscretion) had to count the heap\nof coppers laid one by one\nbefore him. We left the\ncongregation of shop assistants\nfor the pipe cleaner section,\nand then to the gilt wrapping\ncounter where we nearly\nobtained a third gift for our\nProfessor, the gift wrapping\ngirl herself. Unfortunately we\ndid not have enough coppers\nto afford the pink ribbon to tie\nher up. Hence part one of the\noperation was completed by\nwhisking the present back to\ncollege and into one of the\nlockers.\nThe next part of this epic\nconsisted of eighty bleary-eyed\nstudents dragging themselves,\nunaccustomed ly early, out of\nbed to make the following\nMonday's9.30 lecture on time\nin order to witness the final\nceremony. Having been kept\nwaiting for some ten minutes,\nan enquiry resulted in the\ndiscovery that our efforts had,\nfor the time being, been in vain,\nand by some quirk of the timetable the lecture was now to be\non Tuesday. So, by a super-human effort. we got to Tuesday's lecture at 9.30 and our\nhonoured Professor could evade\nus no more.\nAmidst a flurry of snap-shots, he soon realised that a neatly packed object awaited\nhim on the front desk. With\ncries of 'Open it' ringing round\nthe lecture theatre he duly\nobliged, and while the camera\nmen were busily working away,\nhe managed to tear his way\nthrough the ribbons and paper\nand reach the pri sed contents.\nRaising the items good\nhumour ed ly to the chant of\n'For He's a Jolly Good Fellow'\nhe came as near to blushing as\nhe ever will; but he always\nmaintained his dignity.\nSo a final message to all\nfuture Electrical Engineering\nstudents: remind Prof Brown\nthat it's 'Braces Before\nBreakfast!'.\nYes, it was a pair of braces!\nSOCIALISM AS THE\nBASIS FOR COMMUNIS\n- A TALK BY CHRIS BRYANT AT 7PM, TUESDAY\nDECEMBER 10TH IN THE ICVVA LOUNGE.\nORGANISED BY THE IC COMMUNIST PARTY\n0%\nImperial College Operatic Society\npresents\nA CHRISTMAS CONCERT\nof\nModern, Classical and Traditional Music in Holy\nTrinity Church, Prince Consort Road at 8pm, Thursday, December 12th,1974 Admission Free Collection for Charity\n*c eG+ CHRISTMAS UNION10 th MEETING dec.1o' clock "

    "content": "14\nFit IX\nChanging but\nChangeless\nyrs in\nJohn Mortimer CONGRATULATIONS, 'FELIX' on 25 years of invaluable\nservice to the IC Union. May the RSM add to the many wishes for\nthe paper's continued success.\n1949-1974 have been years of considerable change in our own\nsociety and throughout the world. Every institution has responded\nin its own way. The RSM has\nexpanded to meet the demand\nfor engineers, metallurgists\nand geologists, brought about\nby the significant growth of\nour industry.\nProudly the RSM stands\nahead of the field in the\ntechnical aspects of its dis-c ip lines, but tenaciously we\nhave held on to our traditions\nand spirit. The loss of some\ncohesion in the college'^\nactivities, remembered so welf\nby RSMA members of that time,\nwas a necessary sacrifice to\nthe need for expansion.\nThankfully our small and\nfriendly atmosphere has\nsurvived. At least ours is not\nto become a giant and im-personalised institution.\nLooking back into our past\nI found that during those\nmomentous days leading to the\ncreation of \"FELIX* .the Mines\nUnion was locked in seri oy s debate concerning the format\nof their Freshers Dinner. 5/-a head was the suggested\nprice and yards were 'naturally'\nto be consumed in the bar\nafterwards. The only controversy was whether to have\nthree or four free fir kin s of\nbeer!\nThe capacity of Minesmen\nto enjoy themselves was never\nin question, so much so that\nsuccessive Presidents had to\nwarn the members of the\ndangers of excessive festivities\non Guy Fawkes and Morphy\nDay. 'The police', they were\nwarned, 'would take strict\naction If there was any improper\nbehaviour on Morphy Day'.\nThe college assured them that\nbrawls on Bonfire night with\npolice and fire brigade would\nresult In the offenders being\n'send down'. I'm told it was\ntraditional to try to set fire\nto 'AlberfW-1955 the Union bought, and\nchristened, the first\n'Clementine', an immense 15\nton traction engine, as their\nfirst mascot. Realising the\nneed for a violate mascot as\nwell, they also a qui red 'Mitch'-the only Michelin Man in the\nworld to wear mines colours\nand a hard hat. Unfortunately,\nhe appears to have been\nviolated sometime between\nthen and now!\nThe first stage of expansion\ntook place in 1956. They lifted\nthe roof off the Mines building\nand built a new floor on top\nwhile the intrepid few continued their work beneath.\nUnfortunately Clementine's life was short but eventful. In\n1959 her boilers were certified\nas unsafe and she made her\nlast journey to that scrap yard\nin the sky. The enthusiasts\nwere not to be deterred,\nhowever, and soon they found a worthy successor in the form\nof our present 1926 Morris\nCommercial Lorry. Not ones\nto break with tradition,' the\nMinesmen named herC/e men f/ 'ne.\nBy all accounts 1959 was a humdinger year and not so\nunlike the present day. Even\nthen \u2022 the President observed\nthat 'the RSMU had no home of\nits own, only a small 'toilet-sized' office\", It wasn't the\nsame office, mind you, but we\nare little better off in our\npresent orf ice known as 'the\nbroom cupboard'.\nTypical with their deep\nsense of association with\nSouth Africa the 1959 RSMU\ndebated and passed, 108 votes\nto 14, the motion 'this Union,\nwhilst not condoning Apartheid\nshould dissociate itself from\nIC Union in the matter of\nboycotting South Africian\ngoods'. Even then people\nsought to sever the RSM's essential links with the most\nexperienced underground\nmining industry in the world.\nExpansion came again in\n1966 when the new Link and\nSpur buildings of the RSM were\nopened. At that time, Gealogy\nwas a part of the RCS, a disadvantage that they have\ndone well to overcome in the\nlast 8 years since their transfer\nto the RSM. This important\nstep meant that in one building\nand one college the RSM had\nthe technical facilities to\neducate engineers (difficult\nthough it may be!) and carry\nout research into the entire\nmining industry from exploration\nto the finished product. This, I believe, is one supreme advantage of the RSM and one\nreason for the strength' and\ncomradeship. which, once\ndeveloped in college, is so\neasily carried over into the\nindustry.\nTwo new departments have\nsince served to increase the\nscope of the RSM activities.\nMaterial Science in 1970 and\nPetroleum Engineering in\n1974 must make us one of the\nmost broad based mining\ncolleges in the world.\nFor all we have changed\nwith the times, in the technological field, we have\nmaintained our social style\nthroughout these 25 years.\nF Q Ram Richard War ing What has science brought us? For the vast majority of the\npopulation only more drudgery and less skill in their work:\nslavery to the machine. Is this a benefit? Shouldn't we revert\nto a simpler existance where a man made for himself all he\nneeded?\nO.K. So that's an extreme position, and not totally valid.\nWhat I really mean is: have we let technology advance\nuncontrolled in the wrong direction? We have never, in the\nadvanced western nations, had it so good materially, but are\n\"\nwe not now totally dependent on the technology we have\ncreated; a technology that cannot adapt and is beginning to\nmake us pay for its use of dwindling resources and energy\nreserves. A technology based on non-renewable fossil fuels\u2014\nthe reserves of which are shrinking fast.\nFrom this giant technological mushroom we have, of\ncourse, gained considerable material advantage. We have\nconquered many diseases, but have increased others: cancers,\nand heart diseases. Most of the annual consumption of\nresources is done by the advanced nations, whose citizens\nchase the ever receding goal of increased living standards.\nThese humans, ourselves, are over supplied. We have great\nchoice \u2014 cheese from England or Switzerland, cars from\nJapan or America, beer from Germany or Australia \u2014 unnecessary and energy consuming transfers of goods all\nsacrificed to the god of increased living standards. Meanwhile,\nwe allow half the population of earth to starve.\nMany of our much vaunted new technologies serve to\ncreate more waste which has to be disposed of somehow.\nPerhaps the most horrible example of this is the new generation of fast breeder reactors which have been hailed as\na panacea to our energy problems. However, what do we do\nwith Plutonium waste \u2014 it is going to hang around for a very\nlong time and it's very toxic. The Panacea may prove to be\npoi son.\nI don't suggest that we should stop advancing. What I do\nsuggest is that we search for better ways to advance. There\nhas already been a great deal of talk about the environment,\nbut little action. If we continue in our current ways, failing\nto face the problem, then within the next century at the outside there will be catastrophic results. It may be unpopular\nto a ay we must cut back \u2014 clean up \u2014 have a reduction in\nliving standards but it is a reality that must be faced. You\nmay believe humanity is destined to reach the stars, but\nhadn't we better clear up our own little sphere first.\nCOUP t f Richard War ing TWO IC STUDENTS were\narrested at 1a.m. on Thursday\nat Gloucester Road Tube\nStation after removing adverts\nfrom a tube train. The two:\nErica Graham, RCSU treasurer,\nand Steve Brightman, RCS\npublicity officer, were taken\nto a police station where they\nwere charged with breaking\nSection 2 of the Theft Act,\n1968, Later they were released\non \u00a350 bail which they did not\npay. On appearing in court the\nfollowing morning at 11a.m., they pleaded guilty. Both were\ndischarged with \u00a35 costs. Their\ncase took five minutes.\nThat at least has remained\nunaffected by the decadence of\nour age. But greater changes\nare forecast. A recession is\nwidely predicted and overseas\nmining is threatened by the\nemergence of the new and\nhighly nationalistic nations.\nWill the RSM graduate need to\nbe different to cope with this?\nMy guess is that he won't. Instead of being Empire\nbuilders (for what is a Empire\nfounded on if not on mineral\nwealth), they will become\neducators and consultants to\nthe developing nations and\ndiplomats in the politically\nhot climates of Africa and\nAmerica. Above all the sense\nof adventure, resourcefulness\nand enthusiasm of Minesmen\nwill be in constant demand for\nat least another 25 years.\nTo Minesmen I finish with\nthis plea:\nChange and decay in all\naround I see,\nO thou, who changes t not\nabide with me.\n\n"

However, I also\nsee no reason, or right, by\nwhich a few women in IC\nshould demand that the average\nIC student stop enjoying\nhimself. Surely the Union Bar\nis the place where the student\nwho wants to drink may do so\nTherefore, to stop him getting\npissed, drinking yards etc.,\nwould seem ludicrous.\nFinally, drawing Miss\nDunning's attention to an\narticle by Kate McKinnon in\nthe same edition:\n'The common outcry from girls\nat IC is that they do not get a fair deal, but how many are\nguilty of looking more like men\nmucking in with the lads and\nwalking along as if they had\njust stepped down from a horse'\nMight I suggest that the\nwomen of IC get their tactics\nfor the war of the sexes sorted\nout before they enter battle.\nYours,\nM. Earle.\nN. Salisbury.\nFUfiYrfT\nLEEDSNINE FORCED 10 RESIGN\nI by Richard War ing TWO WEEKS ago the Leed University Union council passed a motion by 10 votes to 9, paragraphs of which read: 'The nation'\na list population of Northern Ireland is quite right to employ\nphysical force to defend itself against British troops and\nsectarian assassination squads' and 'The Irish people have the\nright to use any means they\nwish, including the shooting\nof British soldiers and police,\nin order to try and drive British\nImperialism out of Ireland'.\nBesides the nineteen who\nvoted seven council members\nabstained and a further seven\nwere absent.\nPete Gillard, a member of\nInternational Socialists and\none of the proposer s of the\namendment pointed out that\nLeeds University Union had\nalready a definite Northern\nIreland policy having already\nvoted in 1972 in support of\nthe IRA.\nRoger Seddon opposed the\nmotions. He said he was\nconvinced the motions did not\nrepresent the feeling of the\nstudent community and it was\nwrong to support killings by the\nIRA.\nWhen the motion was made\npublic it caused fur ore among\nLeed's students and a General\nMeeting was called for the\nfollowing Tuesday to discuss\nand ratify the motion.\nOver 3,000 students\nattended the UGM which\ncontinued in a field after a bomb threat. At this meeting\nthe original motion was\ndefeated overwhelmingly. A motion calling for: opposition\nto terrorists, a withdrawal of\ntr pups as soon as possible,\nand the end of interment was\nwas passed in its stead.\nNine of the council members\nwho supported the motion, had\na motion of no confidence past\nagainst them and were thus\nforced to resign. The remaining\nmember who voted for the\nmotion, Dave Smith, was a sabbatical officer and had an\nexpression of no confidence\npassed against him (which in\neffect gives him one more\nchance).\nImperial College Union.\n28th November, 1974.\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to the IF article in\nthe last issue of FELIX, I should like to ask what gives\nMiss McKinnon the right to set\nherself up as judge and jury of\nan entire college about which\nshe obviously knows very little.\n<She believes herself and\nthe other women of IF are the\nCleopatras and Elizabeth Is of\nthe world (I should just like to\npoint out that Cleopatra for all\nher great leadership, fell foul\nof the typical female flaw of\ndying for the love of a man, and\nElizabeth I died the Virgin\nQueen \u2014 say no more!) and that\nwe of IC are guilty of bringing\nourselves nearer to a unisex\nsociety.\nAll I can say is,well done IC! Has, I wonder, Miss McKinnon\nany idea of the strength of\ncharacter needed by IC women\nto carry out their causes against\nopposition from their schools,\noutside employers, and worse\nstill from the attitude of the\nmen of IC.\nI admire every, and any\nwoman here who has tire willpower to go through with\nparticularly a Mining or Engineering course. So we don't all go around looking like\nParis models (did someone\nmention a student grant?),\nI feel we have more important\nday, to day battles than whether\nor not our make-up's patchy.\nIt is time we threw off the\nshackles of a society that\ndictates the shape of our\nbody, the colour of our hair\nand eyes, our only assets\nwhen voicing an opinion.\n' Perhaps it does flatter the\nego to win an argument by\nfemale charm and gain the\nadmiration of your male opponent \u2014 but it is admiration of\nthe body, not the mind.\nIf at present the only way\nto gain recognition is by\ndressing more like a man, then\nkeep to your jeans. You are,\nafter all, as much a woman in\njeans as you are in a dress.\nYours faithfully,\nJulia Dunning,ICWA President.\nImperial College,\n26th Nov., 1974\nDear Sir,\nDon't let us ever hear that\ncommunists believe in dem-oc racy. After seeing Mary\nAttenborough, an active member\nof the Young Communist\nLeague, removing from the\nCollege Block Lower Refectory\nevery copy of a political\nleaflet opposing the domination\nby communists of the student\nunions, I can only conclude\nthat for them democracy means\nthe freedom for them to go\nabout wrecking the country\nand no freedom for the majority\nof anti-communists to oppose\nthem.\nYours faithfully,\nAnita Hamilton.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX13 WAS NEWTON WRONG?\n\"No!\" Says the Prof\nRi zSh a kir Electrical Engineering\ndepartment has presented us\nwith numerous surprises to\ndate and Professor Laithwaite\nhas certainly had as much of a hand in these as any other\nsingle man. His latest brain-child, (a demonstration of\nwhich had been given at the\nRoyal Institution a few weeks\nago), sounded fascinating in\nmore ways than one. A request\nwas put in by FELIX that it\nbe allowed to photograph the\nmachine and be given some\nsimple explanations. Professor\nLaithwaite promptly obliged\nand a demonstration was put\non for us on Thursday, 28th November.\nThe twin gyro es were made\nto spin by means of compressed\nair, until the noise due to the\ninteraction of the compressed\nair and the surface of the metal\nbecame ash re ak( speed of\ngyro ca_1200 rpm). Professor\nLaithwaite then lifted the\ngyroscopes about six inches\nand released them; the motor\n(this makes the support of the\ngyroscopes spin in a horizontal\ndirection) was switched on at\nthe same time.\nWls/<SHT\nM \u00bbJT\u00a9\u00a3\nPlVCT\nF/G.1 As gyroscopes in turn ran\ndown the parabolic track, the\nmachine (see fig. 1 for position) started to lift. On reaching the\nbottom of the track, the gyroscopes immediately returned to\ntheir original position at the\ntop and subsequently ran down\nthe track. The up thrust thus\nproduced, although varied\nconsiderably due to there being\nonly two gyroscopes, but was\nun doubt ably present. The\nresultant motion was very jerky.\nThe explanation as to the\ncause of this up thrust is given\nby vector summation of the\nvarious intermediate forces as\nthe gyroscopes undergo the\nabove mentioned cycle.\nConsidering a gyro which is\nalready at the top of the motion;\nit is clear that as it goes down\nthe track it experiences both\naction and reaction. However,\nwhen it lifts from the lowest to\nthe highest point, there is\naction but no reaction. Thus\nvector summation gives us a resultant upwards force, and\nit is this force which produces\nthe lift.\nThe principle was demonstrated much more convincingly on a larger single\ngyro (fig. 2). With the gyro not\nspinning the manual handle was\nused to make the gyro and arm\nmove in a horizontal circle,\nthen on placing one's hand in\nthe way of the arm one\nexperienced considerable\nforce. On the gyro being made\nto spin it p recessed at a considerable rate, however if\none how placed one's hand in\nthe way of the p recessing gyro,\n'one experienced no force', all\none needed to do was take its\nweight. In fact, the gyro just\napproached . one's hand\ninstantaneously came to a stop; dropped down and on\nreleasing immediately started\nthe precession with a 'constant\nangular velocity'; in other\nwords there was 'no time of\nacceleration or retardation'.\nThis implies that the gyro has\nno angular momentum, this\nhowever, is not possible,\ntherefore Professor Laithwaite\nstates that the momentum must\nbe imaginary, i.e. it has square\nroot of negative one in front\nof it. Professor says it was\neasier for him to realise this\nbecause he is an electrical\nengineer and therefore has\nknown of similar cases with\ninductance s, where one has to\nintroduce imaginary numbers\nfor some properties.\nAbove will seem not to be\nin accordance with 'Newton's Laws' and indeed this case is\nnot covered by them. However,\nthe Professor points out that\n'Newtonian' consideration only\ncovers 'constant acceleration',\nwhereas this case involves rate\nof change of acceleration.\nHence Professor Laithwaite\nclaims to have made an\nextent ion to Newton's Laws and\nnot disproved any part of them\n(reports in some scientific\njournals that the Professor has\ndisproved these laws are false\nand unfounded).\nProfessor was at pains to\nexplain that his machine does\nnot violate the 'Law of Conservation of Energy' and that\nthe energy is supplied by the\nmotor.\nThis machine has countless\npossible applications, especially in space travel. I think the whole college will\njoin me in wishing, Professor\nLaithwaite, best of luck and\nevery success with this\nmachine and subsequent\nresearch.\n7/7/ f7*( Many thanks to Alan Atwood for his help and\nco-operation).\n\n"

    "content": "18 FELIX REVIEWS Continued from page 17\ninstead of Gary Glitter or make a nice\nchange from Pink Floyd any day.\nJohn Barry: Play It Again (Polydor)\nJOHN BARRY conducts some of his\ntheme tunes from stage, screen and\ntelevision. Good though it is, I find it\ndifficult to imagine an occasion when it\nwould be appropriate to play it. I have\nalways wanted to get hold of an album of\nmarches containing the Monty Python\ntheme music and play it, full volume, in\nSouthside, about fifteen minutes before\nMonty Python comes on television.\nSuddenly the deserted stairways would\nbecome a hive of activity as bespectacled,\npen clutching young men drop their\ntext-books and race towards the television. But none of the tracks on this album would\nhave the same effect.\nTheme music is very difficult to\nseparate from the film or programme it\nsupports, It summons up the atmosphere\nof the film and if the film was bad then\nthe music, however good it may be, will\nnot be received favourably. For example,\nJohn Barry wrote the theme music of\n'Juke Box Jury' and the thought of David\nJacobs' slimy manner could turn one off\nBarry's music for life.\nThe music on this album certainly\ndeserves to exist in it's own right. You\nmay think that film music has to be slosh y with masses of wai ling viol ins and chanting\nladies. This music is not like that: it is\npossible to create an atmosphere without\nresorting to sentimental sog. Barry's music is characterised by pizzicato\nstrings, simple production, frequent key\nchanges and subtle hints of piano.\nJohn Barry started out as a rock and\nroll band leader and later worked with\nAdam Faith as arranger and composer.\nThis led him into films and he now has\nan impressive list of film scores to his\nname including 'The Ipcress File', 'Alice\nin Wonderland', 'Dr. NO', 'Diamonds are\nForever', 'From Russia With Love' and\nmany others. If you want to hear some of\nhis music without getting hold of this\nalbum then listen to Lulu's new single\n'The Man With The Golden Gun' for which\nhe wrote the music. This album includes\nthemes from 'OrsonWells Great Mysteries',.\n'Walkabout' and my favourite, the title\ntrack, 'Play It Again' from 'The Tamarind\nSeed'.\nUnfortunately, I do not think there is a market for this kind of music. It is okay\nfor whiling away a hangover or as a substitute for Andy Williams at cocktail\nparties but presumably the main custom\nwill come from film-goers attempting to\npreserve memories of particular films.\nThe Hollies: I'm Down (Polydor)\nTHIS SINGLE is fairly typical Hollies\nstuff. They have hardly progressed at\nall since the days of my youth when\ntheir popularity was at its height. The\nsinger wails about some bird who's just\nchucked him and a full orchestra provide\nthe accompaniment for him to wail along\nwith.\nThe flip-side is a little better with a slightly more^ub tle production but the\nlyrics are just as inane and on the same\nsubject.\nMaybe it's time they gave up.\nJack Llewellyn\nElectric Light Orchestra: Showdown\n(Harvest)\nTHIS ALBUM, which features the\nextraordinarily diverse work of Roy Wood\nand Jeff Lynne, is basically a retrospective compilation of the magic that is\nthe Electric Light Orchestra. The best\naspect of it all is that none of the tracks\nare presented in their commer ical, single\nform \u2014 they are given the full treatment.\nOld favourites such as '10538Overture' 'Roll over Beethoven' and 'Showdown'\nsound as fresh as ever. There are also a couple of popular album cuts such as\n'Whisper in the Night', 'Queen of the\nHours' and 'In Old England Town'.\nPaul Ekpenyong\nWishbone Ash: There's The Rub\n(EMI MCF 2585)\nTHERE ARE only six tracks on this\nalbum and from the first 'Silver Shoes',\nan exhilarating rhythmic steady beat to\nit through to the last on side two 'FUBB'\nwhich is a truly incredible way out piece\nof music, there is not a single dud track.\nFUBB stands for Fxxxx Up Beyond\nBelief, a rather incongruous title though\nperhaps not altogether inappropriate and\nthe sort pseudo-psychedelic feeling now\npermeating the music industry. A touch of\nthe congas by Nelson 'Flaco' Padron\nadds the finishing touches to this\nDefinitely a collector's item which\nfaithfully captures the unique sound of\nthe Electric Light Orchestra.\nTangerine Dream: Phaedra (Virgin)\nTHIS IS a record which simply stands\nhead and shoulders above any other on\nthe market today. It is an incredible\nfusion of superb artistry, ex tempor is at ions on the concept of sound and fine stereo\nrecording technique. There are no other\nrecords around like it except for others\nby Tangerine Dream and possibly very\nearly Pink Floyd. Like, man, you just\ngotta let yu h lug 'ole s check it out!\nThe title track, 'Phaedra', takes up\nside one and is a multi-juxtaposition of\nsuperbly arranged track.\nThe other two tracks on side one are\n'Don't Come Back' and 'Persephone'.\nThe former features excellent guitar\nplaying backed by deep ed earthy bass\nand drums from Martin Turner and Steve\nUpton respectively. The latter is a slow\ntempo ed piece that drifts, cascades and\nflats almost as if on a surrealistic\njourney.\nOn side two there is 'Hometown',\nwhich would probably make a disco hit,\nand also 'Lady Fay', the lyrics of which\nare based on a Dartmoor folk legend.\nThe whole album is well arranged and\nthe production is good and the group have\ncertainly done well to produce an album\nmysteriously compelling themes which\nmentally conjure up visions of melancholy\ncosmic spirituality. The final sixty\nseconds are best described as odd: the\nsounds of squealing schoolchildren in\nthe distance broach ones ears. Too deep\nfor me, sunshine.\nOf the three tracks on side two,\n'Mysterious semblance at the strand of\nnightmares' is a absolute must to be\nheard on headphones. It is a basic texture\nof slow cade nti al sequences (reminiscent\nof Bach) played on the organ with decorative wisps of white noise thrown in\nwith stunning effect.\nThis album has to be one of the most\nsignificant around.\nof such high musical quality. Highly\nrecommended.\nJames Last: Golden Memories\n(Polydor)*.\nYET ANOTHER hit for James Last,\nHis Orchestra and Chorus. The combination of powerful melody, beautiful\narrangement, good solid rhythm and clean-cut brass \u2014 the last trade mark \u2014 have\nbeen applied to 27 pieces of music of\nvarious class and background to produce\na pleasant album. Some of the songs and\nmusic featured include 'Toreador's March' from Carmen, 'Sanfa Lucia', 'Hava\nNagilah', 'If You Know Suzie' and\n'Charleston'.\nHie\nCountry Life (Island\nRoxy Music:\nILPS 9303)\nTHIS IS the fourth Roxy Music album,\nfollowing in the tracks of the reasonable\n'Roxy Music', the good 'For your Pleasure',\nand 'Stranded' a truly fine album progressing steadily from initial experimentation and gimmickry to musicianship\nand consistency.\nThe guiding influence of Roxy Music\nis Bryan Ferry, who produced this album,\nbut although remaining 'num ero uno' the\nwriting has been shared in part by fellow\nmusicians Manzanera and Mackay. 'The\nThrill Of It AIT begins the album in\npowerful style combining inimitable\nvocals from Ferry with a harsh, complex,\narrangement and relentless beat. This\nhigh standard is maintained through\n'Three and Nine', the present single\n'All I Want Is You', and the excellent\n'Out Of The Blue' highlighting the\nsynthesizer effects of Eddie Jobson, and\nthe pounding rhythm section of John\nGustafson (bass) and Paul Thomspson's considerable percussive abilities, who\npropel all the numbers along with venom.\nAs on previous albums a number of\ntracks fall short of the overall standard.\nThese include the rather ordinary blues\n'If It Takes All Night' and the opening\ntwo tracks on side two 'Bitter Sweet' \u2014\nan interesting piece but one which tends\nto drag it's feet, and the rather poor\n'Tryptich' \u2014 Roxy Music play Steeleye\nSpan. From then on the music rises in\nquality, as 'Casanova' lurches away with\nan admirably magnetic riff, guitar swooping\nimaginatively around the nucleus of organ,\nbass and drums.\n'A Rea'll y Good Time' provides the\nrecord's most melodic number with the\nvocals in complete control, tastefully\nsung over a background of falling piano-,\nviolins and subdued drums. Closing with\n'Prairie Rose', this is an accomplished\nalbum, a good couple of notches above\nother recent releases, constantly Interesting and varied in it's approach,\nnotably the emergence of Phil Manzanera\non guitar, adding a further dimension to\nthe sound.\nOn the whole a well worthwhile LP.\n\n"

The left-wing\nmembers of the NUS, together\nwith those of the Trade Unions\nand of the Labour party, have\nalready been largely responsible for eroding much of\nthe freedom of individuals in\nthis country \u2014 viz. the ban on\nright-wing speakers of socalled educational establish-ment s, besides the curbs on\ninitiative and incentive in the\nfield of employment, and an\ninclination towards too. much\ndependance on the 'Sfafe'.\nSuch people as the former\nLord Stansgate have condescendingly taken upon\nthemselves to try to deny\nothers the opportunities from\nwhat they themselves have\nhave already benefitted.\nVERONICA SHEREWOOD, an\na untie from Ashford in\nMiddlesex, is in the Department\nof Geology and is studying in\nher final year.

Well,\neveryone has their price don't they? Seriously though there\nis no reason nowadays for\nanyone to subscribe to such\ngeneralisations.

Apart from\nhaving a very fine christian name, he has a humour which belongs\nin the ranks of the pioneering\nPython or the inimitable Goons.\nUnfortunately, though, after\na good start, and an extremely\nexpressive guitar solo on a3 necked-3 stringed instrument,\neven Mr. Spear, while interviewing the sweet young\naspirants to the title 'Drag\nQueen 1974', resorted to the\nstandard kind of predictable\nsexual innuendo gags that we\nassociate with the Miss World\nfiasco.\nPreceding the drag contest\nwas the rag contest; sadly\nirrelevant this year following\nthe abandonment of the Rag\nprocession.

    "content": "FELIX7 P.G AFFAIRS\nCORNER Tom Abraham\nWHILE BEING interviewed for the special FELIX feature on\nShould the PG Affairs Officer be on the Exec or not?, I was told\nthat some postgraduates were against having departmental groups.\nI would like to take this opportunity to state that the IC post grad group does not intend to smash the place up, have sit-ins,\nintimidate anybody, or carry\nout any acts of mindless\nmilitancy. All we wish to do\nis try and create the conditions\nfor a better academic and social\nlife for every postgraduate\nstudent. When, as happened\nlast summer, it is impossible\nto organise interdepartmental\nsoccer because of the lack of\ncontacts in many of the\ndepartments, then there is\nsomething obviously wrong\nwith the set-up. The ICPGG\ntogether with the departmental\ngroups provides the means\nwhereby the PG's at IC can\nbreak out of their self-imposed\nisolation.\nAt the moment we have\ndepartmental groups in Maths,\nGeology, Elec Eng and Chem\nEng and sectional groups in\nIndustrial Sociology and\nManagement Science. There\nare moves afoot to form groups\nin Civ Eng -and Chemistry.\nThis, however, still leaves a number of departments where\ncuts and the effect this was\nhaving on postgraduate dem-on st rating, and finally one\ndemanding that thesis costs\nbe met by college. While on\nthe face of it, our chances of\nsuccess with respect to these\nmotions seem rather gloomy, I think we have far rly strong\ncases with the first two, and\non thesis costs we should at\nleast (at a time of soaring\ncosts) be reimbursed for the\ncopies we have to give IC and\nthe . University. More about\nthese Issues in later FELICES.\nFinally, we are organising\na Christmas lunch on Friday\n20th December. It will cost\n10p and we hope you will all\ntry and make a special effort\nto come; there will be lots of\ngoodies for everybody.\nthere are no postgraduate\ngroups at all. If anybody in\nany of the departments not\nmentioned wishes to help form\nPG groups, then please get in\ntouch with me (Int. 3103). The\nICPGG gets money from the.\nUnion, and we will be only\ntoo glad to help departmental\ngroups as far as the financial'\nside is concerned. Finally, to\nthose individuals who scoff at\nthe PG group, let me point out\nthat this group was only formed\nabout eighteen months ago. We\nhave done remarkably well,\nconsidering that postgraduates\nare among the most difficult\nof student groups to organise.\nMany postgraduates totally\nignore the three constituent\ncollege unions. The CCU's although a lot of their\nactivities are undergraduate\noriented also organise a number\nof functions which would appeal to postgraduates. In view of\nthis, and because I feel that\nsomething must be done to\nbring postgraduates into the\nmainstream of student life, a joint letter by the ICPGG and\neach of the CCU's is being\nsent to every postgraduate.\nI hope you will respond, by\nparticipating in at least some\nof the CCU activities.\nThe ICPGG had a general\nmeeting on the 21st November,\nand the turnout was very\nencouraging. A number of\nmotions were passed, among\nthem one opposing the total\nban on tuition, another one\ncondemning the expenditure\nScience:S B Years tin Peter Glass \"WHEN TODAY'S IC graduate\nheads into the world of industry and\ngovernment, he will find attitudes to\nScience and Technology which have\nchanged markedly from those the IC\ngraduate of 1949 encountered'.\nIn the immediate post-war years there\nwas great optimism tor the future role of\nscience and technology. Recognising\ntheir contribution to the war effort,\nincreased support was given by both\ngovernment and industry. The Scientific\nCivil Service was established, industry\nbegan to Invest in R&D( Research and\nDevelopment) on a much larger scale.\nThe funds allocated to science grew\nsteadily and educational facilities were\nexpanded to meet the growing demand for\nscientists and technologists. Their status\nwas changing \u2014 they were no longer the\npoor relations of the other professions.\nThere was 'high public faith in the\neft ice n cy of science'. It was believed\nthat there was nothing man could not\nachieve through the power of science\nand technology.\nThis euphoria lasted throughout the\n50's and into the 60's. Science was in a 'Golden Age'. Funds continued to grow\nbut the emphasis on national security\nand atomic energy gradually gave way to\na more systematic allocation of resources\nJjased on the drive for economic growth.\nDuring the 50's Britian's economic\nperformance, measured in terms of\ngrowth, was poor compared with many\nwestern nations and it was held that\nour poor record in techno logi o al innovation in industry was a contributory\nfactor. In the light of this, technological\nprojects like Concoroe wsr t run ve ii ed, the Brain Drain scare began (1963),\nHarold Wilson spoke of forging socialism\nthrough the white heat of the technological\nrevolution and the Robbins report (leading\nto a massive expansion of higher ed-u cation) was published.\nAs the sixties wore on through this\noptimism began to fade and was replaced\nby a growing disenchantment with science\nand technology. They had failed to solve\nmany of the problems that it had been\nhoped would be overcome. The panacea\nfor all society's ills was not perfect. So\nin 1962 with the publication of Rachel\nCarson's high-impact quasi-poetic\n'Silent Spring', the issue of the environment began to emerge. This was\nclosely followed by a fiercer political\ncritique - 'The Technological Society'\nby Jaques Ellul.\nThe social costs of many scientific\nand technological advances are now being\nrecognised, in particular in terms of nonrenewable natural resources and pollution\nof the environment. The growing concern\nabout these social costs is reflected in\nthe attempt to develop Technology\nAssessment. This is 'the systematic\nstudy of the secondary or higher order\neffects or impacts on society of a present\nor proposed application of Technology'.\nWhile there are still difficulties in\nfinding and applying methods of analysis,\nhere is an important change in the\nrelationship between science, technology\nand society. The scientist and technologist will need to include new kinds\nof variables into their work to account for\nthese social costs.\nThere is a growing antagonism towards\nscience and technology. Antagonism is\nhardly new but the current wave is\nnotable for its intensity and extent. On\none level science is under attack for\nwhat it now produces, e.g. nuclear,\nbiological and chemical warfare give\nhumankind the capacity for self-annihilation several times over. Attacks\nof this kind are perhaps misdirected in\nthat it is the wider society which directs\nscience towards these goals via the\npro vis i orr of resources for research in\nthese areas. Thus science is not neutral,\nit is a powerful tool of those who can\nafford to finance it. On another level the\ncounter-culture attacks science itself,\nour culture is com in a ted by science, the\nonly acceptable mode of explanation is\nthe scientific mode. So we can experience\nthe world only in terms which scientific\nthinking permi.ts. The counter-culture\nreject this domination, they find it\nrestricting and believe that science\nshould be but one mode of experience\nand explanation, i.e. subjectivity should\ncomplement objectivity.\nGraduates from IC will come to work\nin a world where their activities are\nsubject to ever more careful scrutiny.\nBoth industry and government have begun\nto re-examine their use of science and\ntechnology. In industry this led to a much\ncloser questioning of the relevance of\nR&D to its needs. This resulted in the\nby now familiar story of the drop in\nrecruitment, redundancies etc. of the\nlate 60's and early 70's. Government,\nimp li men ting the controversial Rothschild\nreport, has sought to bring science and\ntechnology into closer service of the\nnations wider social and economic goals.\nSo the 'Golden Age' is over, though\nperhaps its passing should not be\nlamented. Science and technology have\nbrought humankind many benefits and\nwill continue to do so. Our recognition\nthat these benefits are won with certain\ncosts, and our desire to reduce or eliminate these costs should mean that we\nexploit the potential of science and\ntechnology more carefully. This will\nprovide the next generation of IC\ngraduates with a series of new and\nstimulating challenges.\n\n"
