    "content": "Sirs,\nIn this discussion I shall\nattempt to analyse as opposed to\ndescribe aspects of the structure of\nthis union. We are all aware that\nthe checks and balances which\nexist between different sections of\nthe Union makes for a relatively\ndemocratic institution in that no\nextreme view can predominate\nfor long. However, the very\nprocess ol particular sections of the union ensuring that their\nrespective positions are advanced,\nor at least not eroded, means that\nwe are distracted from observing\nthe existence ol attitudes common\nto many sections of the union. In this essay I hope to\ncorrect this imbalance to a certain\nextent. One of the attitudes\nprescient among various sections\nof the union is in my view what I shall call anti-intellectualism.\nThe most notable offenders in this\nrespect are institutions such as the\nCC Us and the Rugby Club; it has\nbeen realised for some time that\nthey attempt to degrade those\npeople who join them with such\nevents as their initiation ceremonies. Smoking Concerts pi\ndoubtful entertainment value,\nand. if the latest example is anything to judge by, rag mags which\ncan only be described as products\nof sick minds. But these are only\nsymptoms of a creeping disease\nwhich attempts to cast people,\nand pe op1 e at a very impressionable age. in the same\nmould, the people who belong to\nand run the CC Us are afraid of\nindividuality since this threatens\ntheir paranoid grasp of these\nreprehensible institutions. The worst example ol this desire lot\nuniformity is in their approach to\nthe intellect: they do not\nconsciously realise that they are\nanti-intellectual, since they are\nnot adult enough to do so. Anyone\nwho is seen taking an interest in\ntt i \"ir academic work, as opposed\nto the minimum amount required\nby the examiners, or some other\nactivity not approved by the\nCCL s. is viewed with great\ndistrust because that person\nrefuses to be taken in by the tribal\nholl c rings ol the CCl' s. Given\nthat intellectuals will not\nparticipate in the pernicious\nactivities ol the CCl s then it\nfollows that non-intellectuals and\nin many cases anti-intellectuals\nwill lake charge ol the CCl s and\nthus perpetuate the system to\nclone their own kind ol beers willing lout. They thus perpetuate the worst aspect ol the\nEnglish public school tradition\nbeing \" all chaps together\",\nsomething Freud would have no\ndoubt ascribed to a latent\nhomosexual desire, and at the\nsame lime despise the intellectual\nside ol the same public school\ntradition so that il is entirely\ndestroyed. The situation would\nnot be so bad Were il not for the\nfact that because they are so\nprominent within the college and\nappeal to the basest instincts of\npeople, people join them before\nthey have a chance of discovering\nthe CC Us true nature or the\nrange of available alternatives.\nOnce in a CCl' all chance of\ndoing something different is\nimmediately denied.\nIl is therefore evident that these\norganisations are detrimental to\nthe life of individual students\nwithin the college. I suggest that\nconsequently they are in breach of\nour bylaws and serious consideration should be given to\nthe abolition of the CCl s. Frank James\nSOCIAL CLUBS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN F.S.1 don't expect anyone 10\nagree with this since to do so\nwould be to break the CCl' s tribal (a lxi os: also they have a lot\nol votes at election lime. Copy Date for next\nFriday's issue\n.... you've missed it!\nLast Friday I went into\nSouthside Refectory for a meal. I had stuffed aubergine. According\nto the price list it cost 67p. With the aubergine you get a certain\namount of rice. I asked for extra\nrice. I then asked lor chips as well.\nI went to pay. I found I had\nsinned.Having rice means you\nhaven't really had the second\nvegetable which the menu says is\nincluded in the price. Therefor\nyou pay six pence less than the\nmenu price.. But rice is an extra\nvegetable over and above the two\nallowed which costs 14p. so you\npay 8p more than the menu price.\nFor this reason, my\"Mooney\"cost\nme 75p. IIT didn't have rice, but\npeas, I would have paid 67p. You may be utterly confused. The point is this; If, in Southside, you\nhave main course plus two ve g. vo u pay menu price. If you have 3\"\nve g. you pay Hp more. If you\nhave 1 ve g. you pay 6p less. If the\nmeal costs 70p, the ve g costs 28p, so the meat bit costs 42p. If you\ndon't have any ve g. at all you pay,\naccording to the rules, 6p less for\nevery ve g. you don't have, leaving\n58p. The meat costs 42p,a gap of\n16p. Dear Freshers, go and pay\nMooney 16p for no meal\nwhatsoever.\nSeriously, if Mr. Mooney can\nexplain this a nomo ly,I would be\nvery pleased.\nYours sincerely,\nNick Davies.\nDear Colin,\nPlease could you put\nthis information in the Freshers'\nissue of FELIX: Tuesday, 2nd. October at\n7.30pm. in the J CR there will be\nthe Life Sciences Freshers' Party\n(admission will be free for Life\nSciences Freshers - others must\nbring a bottle after the bar closes)\nII you need a space tiller please\nput the above somewhere else as\nwell (I'm terrified no-one will\nturn up!).\nKaty Tatchell,\nLife Sciences' Dep. Rep. Sir,\nHaving spent the late BankHoliday weekend in Paris mv\nthoughts have turned to banning\nall smoking on the Underground\nsystem. This would result in a cleaner environment for all. The Metro is an example, in many\nways to our tube system. The Metro rule ol no smoking is\nadhered to by all travellers and\nhas demonstrated the need for\nsuch a policy here.\nYours Faithfully,\nRoger Stotesbury.\nSirs.\nWhy, in the bottom right\nhand corner of the Letters Page, is\nthere always a letter pretending\nnot to be a space lille r:' Yours Esoterically,\nEric Jarvis.

My own recollection, of two\nyears ago, is one of endless queues,\nendless talks and an evening initially\nspent wit n one of my predecessors.\nLet me begin by introducing myself; I like Stanley Kubrick, Sloanes, the\nPurple Hearts, candlelight and breaking\ninto parent's houses. I hate the\nUnderground,\"Charlie\", tinned food,\nwatching television and Capital Radio.\nI'm living in Keogh Hall, Room 388.\nMy job in the Union is one of\ncommunication(! ed), planning, servicing and dealing with the ind'vi dual needs of Union members. I can be found\nin the Union Office, in the Beit building,\nso please come over if you think that\nthere is anything we can do for you. An\nespecially good time to come is during\nthe Fresher's Fair.\nThis is the first of a number of articles\nwhich will appear this year- hopefully\neven if they don't make your pulse\nquicken they will at least keep you\nactively involved.\nThe First Week\nHere's a list of things you should/must\ndo in the first week here:\n1. Register in College\n2. Get an IC Union card(you will need a passport photo) and donate 50p to the\nWU S Scholarship Appeal\n3. Collect Grant Cheque\n4. Take part in Departmental photograph\n5. Complete Medical Card & Medical\nHistory Card\n6. Get a locker in your department\n7. Give your address to the departmental\noffice\n8. Start a bank account\n9. (If applicable) Fill in Parking Permit\napplication form before 5pm. Friday\n10. Attend Fresher's Fair\n11. Attend the Union General Meeting\nThe First Union Meeting\nYes folks, don't be late, join the queue\nand rub shoulders with those who have\nlearnt that UG Ms are perhaps the\nultimate use of one's time. It all happens\nat 1pm on Thursday in the Great Hall.\nLast year saw an increase in the number\nof people turning up for UG Ms and I hope this trend will continue. After all, if\nyou want to make your voice heard, a really effective way is to turn up and vote\non the issues that affect you. Detais of\nUG Ms will be found in EXEC NEWS\nwhich is distributed to all departments.\nThe First Elections\nYes, you've guessed it, some of these\nare caused by exam failures(We wish\nAndy, John, Andy and Scott ah the best).\nThe posts open now are:\na) FELIX Editor- which will be elected by\nCollege wide ballot over two days.\nb) Elec. Eng. Departmental Representative- elected by a one day ballot in the\ndepartment\nc)M in. Re s.Eng. De p.Rep. d) Management Science Dep. Rep\ne)3 ordinary members of the Academic\nAffairs Commitee- elected during U GM on 16th Oct.\nf)2 ordinary members of the Union\nfinance Committee\ng)2 ordinary members of the Comunity\nAction Group\nh)3 ordinary members of London\nStudent Travel Committee\nThe papers for all these posts are up in\neither the Union Lower Lounge or the\nrespective department, so if you fancy\nstanding for one of these posts, find out\nwhat it entails and get a proposer and\nsecond ers. The First Duplicating Demonstration\nTo use one of the Union Gestetner\nDuplicators, which are situated in the\nFELIX Office, you must have attended\none of this year's demonstrations. The\nfirst is on Monday,8th October at 1pm in\nthe FELIX Office. So Secretaries of clubs\nand societies don't forget. On the same\nsubject, you will be able to obtain keys\nfor the duplicators(providing that you\nhave registered) and ink and paper from\nme in the Union Office.\nWell, that's all for now. Hope to meet\nyou soon and have a great time.\nRoger Stotesbury\nGERMAN MEASLES AND\nPREGNANCY\nAs part of a national campaign to\npromote rubella (German measles)\nvaccination and thus further to reduce\nthe number of congenially handicapped babies, the Health Centre offers\nrubella vaccination to all women under\n40 in College and particularly to\nstudents. All women are invited to attend\nthe Health Centre between 10 and 10.30\nam on Wednesdays in the Autumn Term\nfor an initial blood test to de term in if\nthey have immunity (whether or not they have had rubella vaccination already).\nThose who have no immunity will then\nbe sent an appointment for the\nvaccination.\nPG TIPS\nFor Fresher PG s. There is no better\nintroduction to the existing ones than to\ncome along to our bar night on\nWednesday, 3rd October, starting at\n6:00 p.m. in Stan's Bar, Southside. all\n'old' PG s are, of course, equally\nwelcome.\nAll Fresher PG s are automatically\nmembers of the IC Postgraduate Group,\nwhich exists to promote the welfare of\nPG s and to ensure adequate socialization amongst them. Ploughman's lunches, bar nights and a trip to Cambridge were part of our\nagenda last year.\nIt is important for Freshers to\nparticipate in activities outside of 'run-of-the-mill' research and, in addition, to\nthe PG Group, there are many other\nsocieties you may join. Look out for the\n\"Associated Studies\" booklet which\ngives details of many interesting films,\nlectures, concerts etc. - you should find\nsomething to interest you in that.\nIf, during your first weeks here, you\nfind anything puzzling, distasteful or\neven wonderful about postgraduate life\nhere, do not hesitate to let either myself\nor one of my colleagues know about it.\nWe will be available to discuss the\nactivities of the PG Group with you at\nour stall in Freshers Fair (Tuesday, 2nd October - Malcolm tells me it will be in\nSherfield Lower Refectory).\nIf you can't make it to that, then come\nalong to the bar night on Wednesday.\nSee you amongst the' London Pride and\nESB (drinks are sub sidi sed to the tune of\nlOp per pint).\nRICHARD EARL,\nPG Affairs Officer\n\n"

As\nyou should have gathered by now\nfrom the various handbook articles, Rag's main objectives are to\nprovide enjoyment for YOU, whilst\nraising money for our chosen\ncharities. Most of the money is\ncollected on the weekly Rag stunts,\nwt ii ch are organised by each CC Uso do watch out for their posters,\nlisten at their UG Ms and go out there\nand collect, you'll be surprised how\nmuch fun It is.\nWe also intend to hold Rag Mag\nselling trips every Wednesday\nafternoon, providing an excellent\nopportunity to visit other Universities and meet old friends or\nmerely sample their bars. However,\nat the time of writing we are having\ndifficulties persuading someone to\nprint our Mag-so it may not be\navailable immediately.\nBut the main job of the IC Rag\nCommittee is to organise that orgy\nof lunacy known as Rag Week,\nwhich stretches from 14th to 23rd November, and includes such\ntraditional events as Morphy Day,\nthe RCS Revue, Rag and Drag\nDisco, Rag Procession, raft race,\nfilm nigh f and Guilds carnival.\nHowever there are still many gaps\nthat need filling, especially for\nlunch-time events, and to produce\nan original and enjoyable Rag week,\nwe need YOUR ideas and enthusiasm in inventing and\norganising new events. So please\ncome along to our Rag Committee\nmeetings everyone will be\nwelcomed with open arms and free\nbeer to the first meeting-next\nMonday (6th October) at 7:00p.m. in\nthe Senior Common Room (1st floor, Union Building). After that\nthey will be held on Wednesday\nevenings in the ICWA Lounge.\nWatch for further details, both of\nmeetings and of Rag week, in FELIX\nand on posters (wherever you see\n'Superag' signs).\nNow the confusing bit: (if you\naren't confused already!) you'll have\nread in the handbook (I hope) that\nwe were collecting for kidney\nmachines, but we've since been\ninformed that they aren't needed as\nall patients get one from the\nNational Health Service. So we\nmade Kidney Research one of our\nminor charities, and looked around\nfor something else, which was, like a kidney machine, of permanent and\ndirect benefit to someone in need.\nWe decided to buy 'phonic'\nhearing aids for deaf children, as\nR CSU had bought one for the\nbrother of one of our students last\nyear, and this had demonstrated\ntheir great value in the education of\nthe deaf, as this child can now speak\nproperly and attend a normal\nsecondary school. The aid works on\na radio link which enables the child\nto hear his teacher or parent up to\nhalf a mile away, and also eliminates\nthe background noise which makes\nworking in' a classroom with a conventional aid difficult. We are\nbuying these through the National\nDeaf Children's Society, who said,\n\"It is really a tremendous project\nthat you are undertaking\"- they have\nno money available to buy such aids\nthemselves. We also hope to hold a joint event with them, involving the\ndeaf children themselves, aimed at\ngetting good publicity for both of us.\nWe also had a problem in that\nAlcoholics Anonymous apparently \u2022\nare completely self-financing and\ndon't accept outside contributions,\nso we had to drop them from our list\nof beneficiaries. Confused yet? Well\nto clarify the situation, the money\nraised will be divided as follows:\n70% National Deaf Children's Society (to buy 'Phonic Ears')\n15% National Kidney Research Fund\n15% British Heart Foundation\nIf you want to find out more about\nany of these, please come and see\nme and I can give you some leaflets.\nWell, after all that rambling, I think\nI'd better congratulate you on\nhaving got this far, and rush\nspeedily to the end. So remember,\nthe success of the Rag this year\n(can't we beat last year's net total of\n\u00a312,500?), depends on YOUR involvement; so come on the famous\ntiddlywinks stunt on Saturday\n(you'll hear all about it from your\nCCU), come to the Rag meetings,\nand you'll find it's all a lot of fun. ItS\nalso very worthwhile. See you\nSaturday.\nRae Snee\nICU Rag Chairman\nCITY & GUILDS\nWelcome to GUILDS( you'll hear this\nphrase a lot during the first week). This is the\nfirst of, hopefully, weekly articles in FELIX by your overworked Publicity Officer which\nwill let you know what Guilds' events you\ncould go to.\nThe first event is after a morning of tedious\nformal receptions, the GUILDS' Reception\nat 2.30 pm on Monday1 st. in the Union Building. You will-have the chance to meet a few of the people in GUILDS and drink some\nfree beer, followed by a free guided tour of\ndowntown IC.\nTuesday sees the first Union General\nMeeting of the year. This is at 12.45 in Me ch. Eng. 220. For those of you who want serious\ndiscussion go to the ICU meeting, however\nthe GUILDS Union meeting will show you\nhow a Union meeting should be run. There\nwill be examples of how to deal with boring\nUnion Officers, Aeronautical Engineering\nand paper folding ( paper darts to you) and\nabove all fun. Serious matters are also\ndiscussed such as Academic Affairs (Boo!\nHiss!). They are not just for Union Officers.\nWe rely on you to make GUILDS the best\nC CU at IC so make sure you're there so that\nwe can have the loudest BOO MALAK A( the\nGUILDS' chant) yet heard.\nTuesday afternoon is Freshers' Fair. You can wander round the stalls and see which\nclubs and societies you would like to join.\nDon't forget to visit the GUILDS stall where\nwe will be willing to part you from your\nmoney and give you sweatshirts and T shirts\nin various styles, sizes and colours in return.\nWednesday is left free for sports trials if you\nare at all a the let ic. Thursday 4th. is the first Bar Night of the\nterm at 7.30 in the Union Bar. This is an\nevent not to be missed at any cost. This is a chance to let your hair down and make a fool\nof yourself or just watch others doing so. An interesting evening of please nt in bi bing, community singing (songs for all tastes) and\ngames (Boat Races on dry(?) land). In all a worthwhile introduction to one of GUILDS many activities.\nSaturday 6th. is the first Rag collection of\nthe year. Be at the Union Office at 9.30 am to\ncollect your tiddlywinks and Rag cans and\nthen off to Marble Arch for a brisk wink to\nPiccadilly Circus extorting money from the\nshoppers for a good cause and stopping the\ntraffic. A dance round Eros at the end is\nfollowed by rel res hm ents in the Cockney\nPride. We are in competition with the other\nCC U's so the more people that turn up the\nbetter.\nThis has been a look at the fu st week from a Guildsperson's view and there is more to look\nforward to such as a Pub Crawl and a party in\nthe second week, so look out lor the posters\nand Wotzon to see what is happening. If you\nhave any questions or just want to see how\nGUILDS runs just drop into the Union Office on level 3 Me ch. Eng., we don't bite\n(with a few exceptions). We look forward to\nseeing you at these events.\nBryan,\nGUILDS Publicity Officer.\nmm\nicca gOne of the more obscure of the\nacronyms you' ll find at IC If you take the time to find out about us you' ll find us, at\nFresher s' Fair, in the room lab l ted \"concert hall (beit theatre)\"\non the Fair Guide.

Despite College's continued\nsupport of on-course students by\nHardship Fund the situation is very\nunsatisfactory. The rationing by price is\njust one of the Government's stated\ncutbacks in Higher Education and I feel\nthat it is something we must all concern\nourselves with.\nMalcolm and I both attended a conference in Bradford and are totally\ncommitted to take part in some\nnationally coordinated campaign.

I hope that her stay with the\nUnion will be long and enjoyable.\nINJUNCTIVITIS\nRegarding the FELIX Editorship, this\nmatter is still sub jud ice, this means that\nonly facts can be presented and that is\ndone elsewhere. I just hope that things\nsettle down and everyone lives happily\never after.\nWUS SCHOLARSHIP\nOnce again I must urge you to donate\nto the WU S Scholarship Fund, a really\nworthwile cause.\nOUTRO\nIf you read my report to the U GM there\nis plenty more heavy stuff to read and\nthere's hardly been a mention of kinky\nHon. Sex like the old days. I hope your stay here is long, fun and\nsuccessful.\nAnyway, there are three places where I can usually be confronted:\nUnion Office: internal phone no. 3519\nUnion Bar\n41 Evelyn Gardens: I live in 133 Bernard\nSunley House (just goes to prove some\npeople LIKE Student Houses). Please don't hesitate to contact me, for\nany reason.\nCheers CHRIS FOX\nICU PRESIDENT\nTHE BRAIN DRAIN\n(or Alky Malky writes again)\nTHE FRESHERS' BIT\nWelcome to IC! This the first of a series of intensely boring articles, which\na lot of people seem to read anyway in\npreference to paying attention to the\nfirst lecture on Friday mornings. I'm responsible for various odds and sods\nconcerned with running k the Union, if\nyou're interested in how we run things or\nhave any questions about the Union, do\ncome and have a word with me (I'm in\nthe Union Bar most nights). I don't bite!\nOne of the Union's main functions is\nto help cater for your social and sporting\nactivities. If you've ever wanted to take\nup a new hobby but never had adequate\nfacilities available, there's a good\nchance you'll find what you want at the\nFresher's Fair tomorrow, where well\nover 100 clubs and societies will be\nexhibiting in the Union Building and\nSherfield Lower Refectory. There's something for everybody, so do come\nand have a look round. Societies won't be collecting money from fresher s, so if\nyou're interested in any societies, give\nthem your name and they'll get in touch\nwith you. Don't be put off joining a society just because you don't think you\nknow enough about it to be a member,\nthe whole point of these societies is to\ng ivo you the opportunity and training to\ndo something different.\nCRASH PAD\nIn case you didn't know, we are\nproviding camp beds in the Union\nBuilding for 50pa night for people who\nstill haven't found anywhere to live-just\nturn up between 11:00 and 12:00. I expect this to go on for about 3 weeks,\nafter which we'll have to turf people out.\nFRESHER' FAIR\nDue to the work being done on Beit\nQuad, the outdoor stalls have had to be\nmoved to the Queen's Lawn, and I have\nalso decided to use the Sherfield Lower\nRefectory so that more stalls can be\naccommodated. Details of arrangements have been sent to all stall holders, so check your letter racks, and if you\nhaven't received a note, then come and\nsee me. With any luck, there should be a set of maps for the fair and an\nalphabetical list of societies in this\nFELIX somewhere.\nThe tour STARTS AT 2:30, PLEASE\nDO NOT COME BEFORE THIS TIME as\nsocieties will be busy setting up their\nstalls, which is made much more difficult\nif rooms are already crowded with\npeople.\nBAR AND REFECTORY LOSSES\nLast year, \u00a34,000 worth of glasses and\n\u00a36,000 of crockery and cutlery went\nmissing from College bars and refectories. These losses have to be paid\nfor by higher bar and refectory prices, so\ndon't take them away. If these sort of\nlosses continue, the Union may have to\nstart taking disciplinary action against\npeople doing so-remember, you're just\nmaking other people pay by the\nresulting higher prices.\nELECTIONS\nThere are some vacancies on two of\nthe committees which I chair; we need\ntwo ordinary members for the Finance\nCommittee and three for the London\nStudent Travel Committee (which may\nbe on the way to being changed to the\nServices Committee by the first Union\nmeeting on Thursday). Nomination\npapers for these posts are up on the\nCouncil noticeboard in the Union Lower\nLounge now.\n\n"

These are opportunities for\nyou to chat with your friends( or new\nfriends) over a cup of after-lunch tea\n(usually provided), play a game of\nChinese chess or even grip to the ever-present committee members to run\nthings better ... We also welcome any\nwild suggestions and const ruc it ve criticism. There will also be a wide range\nof magazines at hand; from the 'Ming\nPao Monthly' to 'China Reconstruct',\nand a Malaysian Literal monthly to a Hong Kong comic.\nThe emphasis is on good fellowship,\nyou can talk in Chinese, write in\nChinese, or even play in Chinese with\nfellow Chinese students when you want\nto. Of course, you can also learn about\nthe Chinese (we do have some members\nof non-Chinese students), as we hope to\nhave more non-Chinese members as\nwell as Chinese members!\nSo if you do fear that you will go nuts\nwith boredom during your spare time\nand would like to unwind with fellow\nChinese students, then please come to\nsee us at the Freshers Fair and at our\nprivate fresher's reception... and even\njoin us.\nPresident: Ella F.Y.

The final bow at the end of a Bowling\nclub production.\nIC TENPIN BOWLING CLUB\nThe IC Tenpin Bowling Club has a membership that extends from the\nbeginner upwards. Our bowling is based\naround a trios league every Wednesday\nafternoon in term time at the\nCharrington Bowl Tolworth (host of\nmany national and international\ntournaments in recent years.)\nMembers of the club also spend the\noccasional Sunday travelling to\ntournaments at other universities or\nparticipating in the UC TBA inter-universities competition. IC provides\nmost of the members of the University of\nLondon Bowling Team, consisting of up\nto 15 men and at least 5 ladies. Last\nseason the team did fairly well at this\nlevel of competition (the 'A' Team which\nwas comprised of the top 5 bowlers, did\nexceptionally well). Members of the\nteam took many of the individual\nhonours, the London team having a high\nproportion of the better bowlers in the\n\"competition. This year we hope to raise\nthe standard of the team as a whole in\norder to build on this success.\nWe meet outside the entrance to AeroEng (Opposite Beit Archway) to catch\nthe club coach at 2.30 on Wednesday\nafternoons.\nBowling will start on the second\nWednesday of term with casual party\nbowling, the league should start the\nfollowing week. So whether you have a180 average or just bowl for fun IC\nTenpin Bowling Club could be the thing\nfor you.\nIf you're interested (or could get\ninterested) come and see us at our stall\nat Freshers Fair, or contact me through\nthe internal mail.\nBrian MacGowan\nPhysics III\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE BILLIARDS AND\nSNOOKER CLUB\nOn the behalf of my committee, I would like to welcome you to IC ... but I won't: you fresher s' must be fed up with\nall these people you don't know\nwelcoming you to IC.

We are also one\nof the most successful clubs (we have\nwon the League every season, and one\nof our members has always won the\nannual London Colleges' Championships).\nThis year, we will be organising a trip\nto .go and see Benson and Hedges\ncompetition. We will also be organising\ntrips to go to Bennett's, one of the big\nsnooker shops: we have arranged with\nthem a10% discount on all purchases.\nLastly, we will be giving lessons in\nhow to play snooker;\nLesson 1.: For total beginners, to beheld\napprox. once a week during term-time.\nLesson 2: For those who have completed\nlesson 1, to be held approx. once a fortnight during term-time.\nThe object of these lessons is to\nimprove the standard of snooker at IC,\nand to introduce people to a great form\nof relaxation. These lessons are open to\nall members of IC; ie students and staff.\nYou do not have to be a member of the\nsnooker club to attend these lessons\n(though you will' have to join if you want\nto use the tables afterwards). These\nlessons are free, and tuition will be given\nby members of the first team and of the\ncommittee.\nLastly once again, the Freshers'\ntournament will be held within the next\nfortnight.

    "content": "REVIEWS The silene e of a deeps pae emission is\ndisturbed by a distress signal from a small planetoid. The new of the space tug Nost romo awake from hyper sleep expecting to be approaching Earth. Investigating the\nsignals they unwillingly encounter an alien, lifeform which is taken aboard as they head back into space.\nThis is the beginning of the recently released space horror epic ALIEN( X Dir. Ridley Scott). Unfortunately from this point onwards the script becomes more than a little\npredictable, as the monster proceeds to\ndispose of the crew one by one. But the movie has an important saying grace lhc excellent artists and designers involved. The star of the show is un doubt ably the\nalien, a rarely seen but truly horrific creation. It is the conception of Swiss artist Hans Rudi G iger who based it on a drawing from his\nbook Nc crono mi can a must for anyone who appreciates his style of mixing machine and animal until they arc almost one. This is\nevident in his alien, which, although the\nextent ol its intelligence is never made clear, demonstrates its lust lor violence using extendible'\" tongue\" with metallic teeth. It is\nan excellent monster, unlike the usual\" man in a rubber suit\". G iger also designed the\nsurface of the planetoid and the impressive space jockey, a victim of the alien( see photo). Equally as impressive are the design of the\ntug Nost romo and its interior. This was\nmainly. the work oi American cartoonist RonCo bbs, who designed the ship in Dark Star and also some of the can tina creatures in Star War s.He relied heavily on how believable his\nsets looked and succeeded admirably. TheN ostrom o is a tug towing a huge ore refinery some two miles in length. The alien has\nplenty ol places to lay in wait in the maze oll un lit corridors and store rooms. Power is\nreserved lor the modular living quarters and hyper sleep chambers, where the crew plan how to lid themselves ol the being. This darkness is deliberately employed to give a variation on the haunted house idea, and is\nused to great effect, especially during the final\nscenes.\nBack to the plot. The crew consists of a captain Dallas( Tom Sker it t), the heroine Ripley( Sigourney Weaver), navigator Lambert( Veronica Cartwright), science officer Ash.( tan Holme), Kane, Bret and Parker( John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton and Yap he tK otto). Their mission is a commercial venture and they arc depicted very well as casual, normal people just doing a job lor money. The idea ol departing from the usual super smooth astronaut image was\nthat ol writer Dan O'Ban non. cowriter and star of Dark Star. It is quite refreshing to see\nthe crew in casual, functional clothes rather than uniforms. John Hurt is as excellent as\never as the first victim of the alien, while the\nunknown Sig our n cy Weaver, the heroine, is\na little unbelievable. My criticisms of the film arc brie! but\nimportant. Too little emphasis was placed on the story keen scientists and science fiction fans will find a lew Haws. I hey always can. Also blood, gore and terror, even when used\nas well as they arc here, cannot exist alone. Alien tends to ignore mental stimulation and relies on hard physical reaction( it makes you jump quite a lew times). I personally enjoyed it very much and can certainly recommend it\nto those who enjoy being scared, the artwork involved is what will make this a memorable film though. Mark Smith In space noone can hear you scream. "

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Monday, October 1,1979 Issue no. 527\nWhat a rush .... A Freshers' FELIX produced in\nsix days! The photo is of Colin Palmer.\nWe apologise to readers that because Of a sub jud l ce rule; the Freihers' FELTX has had to\nbe censored and rewritten. In the rush some\narticles have had to be left out.\nINJUNCTION\nATTEMPT\nFAILS IN\nFELIX HIGH COURT DRAMA\nEXEC APPOINT COLIN PALMER ACTING FELIX EDITOR\nFollowing the failure of his second year\nMathematics examinations, John Shuttleworth, who was elected FELIX Editor\nlast March, was deemed by College not to be\nof 'good academic standing'. This means that\nhe cannot be registered as a student for the\nsession 1979/80. He is barred from taking up\nthe Sabbatical by a College Governing Body\nregulation, which has been accepted by a Union General Meeting but had not been\nincorporated into the Union Blue Book.\nAfter taking all things into consideration,\nincluding the fact that the Sabbatical is tied to\nthe FELIX Editorship, Imperial College Union\nExecutive issued a statement deeming John\nShuttleworth to be ineligible to take up the\npost of FELIX Editor, and appointed Colin\nPalmer Acting Editor, as he was the runner-up in the original election.\nIC Union Executive\n8th August, 1979\nSolicitors Anscomb Hollingworth wrote the\nfollowing letter to Chris Fox, President of\nImperial College Union, on August 15th1979. Malcolm Brain, Deputy President, also\nreceived a copy of the letter.\n\"We act for Mr Shuttleworth who has referred\na copy of the Union Bluebook to us together\nwith copies of correspondence relevant to his\nimproper removal as Editor of the Union\nnewspaper.\nParagraph 19 of the Rule Book states quite\nclearly that any amendments to the rules can\nonly be incorporated into the Book in\naccordance with rule Wand the Editor of the\nnewspaper can only be removed from office\nin accordance with rule 4b. Mr Shuttleworth has therefore been\nproperly appointed Editor and cannot be\ndismissed in the way in which you have\npurported to do.\nWe are therefore writing to you to require\nyou by next Monday 20th August to confirm\nto us in writing that Mr Shuttleworth will be\nallowed to continue as Editor and that his\ngrant be reinstated.\nIf you are unable to accede to our request\nthen our client will have no alternative but to\ninstitute proceedings against you and the\nDeputy President as officers of the Union for\nthe appropriate co uM order.\"\nOn the 7th September a writ was issued\nagainst Chris Fox and Malcolm Brain, (sued\non their own behalf and on behalf of all other\nmembers of the Executive Committee of\nImperial College Union), accompanied by a summons to attend the High Court of Justice\non the 25th September to defend an\napplication for an injunction to reinstate John\nShuttleworth as Editor of FELIX pending the\nfull hearing of the case. These were served on\nthe I9th September and affidavits from John\nShuttleworth, Sheyne Lucock and Mary\nAttenborough were collected by the Union\nSolicitors on Friday, 21st September.\nThe case was due to be heard by a High\nCourt Judge in Chambers (Q.B.11). At 12:30\nall those concerned trooped in and the\napplication by College to become joined as a party to the action was heard. The barrister\nfor John Shuttleworth opposed this but\neventually Imperial College was given leave\nto be joined as Second Defendants to the\n'on commenced by John Shuttleworth.\ne hearing adjourned at'1:00 p.m. and Mr.\nKing embarked on the plaintiff's case. This\nlasted some forty-five minutes during which\nthe Judge asked many questions. At this point the Union Barrister, (Colin\nManning), rose to reply but the Judge bade\nhim sit, having already decided on his\njudgement.\nIn his Judgement, Mr. Justice McNeill\ndealt at some length with the various issues\nraised by the case. The basic view taken by\nthe Judge, however, was that the Union's Bye-laws could not be read in isolation and\nmust be taken in context with the Union's relationship with the College. Moreover,\nmembership of the Union was restricted to\nmembers of the College and as John\nShuttleworth was no longer the latter then he\nwas not entitled to the rights and benefits of\nUnion membership.\nAllowing also for the balance of\nconvenience between the parties, it was\ninappropriate for the Injunction to be\ngranted.\nThe hearing ended at 4:30 p.m. "

Written and verbal reports\nshould be confined solely to a record of what\nhas happened so far. The sub jud ice rule, of\ncourse, applies equally to other members of\nthe Union and, in your capacity as President,\nyou must rule out of order any attempt to\nEnts apologise s for no Great Hall Gigs due\nto Gordon. Giltrap pulling out. There is a possibility of legal \u2022et lon. P.S. Ents desperately need people.\nPerks: Free Concerts, films, etc.\nSee us at Freshers' Fair in the Ents Room.\n(Stalers also welcome)\nIn the meantime it is important for the\nOfficers and Executive Committee of the\nUnion to appreciate that, theoretically at\nleast, the case is still not closed. John\nShuttleworth is quite entitled to pursue his\nclaim for damages for so long as the Law\nSociety will extend his Legal Aid Certificate.\nIf he does so then, in due course, a Statement\nof Claim will have to be filed with Defences\nserved by yourselves and the College and the\nmatter eventually set down for Trial. This\nprocess will take many months and the\nhearing would almost certainly not take place\nuntil well after the end of the current\nacademic year. In the meantime the issues\nremain sub j uc ice. This means, I'm afraid,\nthat the rights and wrongs relating to John\nShuttleworth's \"dismissal\" should not be\ndebated in the Union. Youarequite entitled to\npresent a report to the Union stating what has\nhappened both in relation to his dismissal\nand the subsequent Court Proceedings but\nyou are NOT entitled to discuss in open\ndebate the rights and wrongs of the case or,\ndebate the merits of the case and the present\nEditor of FELIX should carefully vet any\narticles or letters which appear in its columns.\nAs I see it, however, there is no reason why\nelections should not be held for the new\nEditor of FELIX unless Notice of Appeal is\nlodged within the next few days. It is quite possible, however, that John\nShuttleworth will formally file a Notice of\nDiscontinuance of the present action. If he\ndecides that further Court action is a waste of\ntime then he will probably do so as the\nsub jud ice rule would no longer apply and all\nparties are quite able to then indulge in a free\nfor all debate.\n\n"

An increasing number of\nour branches have Cashpoint outside, which means that\ncustomers can use the machine six days a week outside\nbanking hours.\nSimply slip your Cashpoint card into the dispenser, tap out your own private code number, and the amount you want, up to \u00a3100 a day provided your account can stand ir. Then your card and the cash arc\nreturned in under40 seconds.\nThe Cheque Card\nA Cheque Card carries your name, a specimen of\nyour signature and your card number. When you want\nto pay by cheque for shop purchases, travel tickets,\nrestaurant bills, for instance, or you want to cash a cheque for yourself in a bank branch other than your\nown, the Cheque Card confirms to the person taking\nyour cheque that Lloyds Bank will honour it-up to \u00a350\nfor any one transaction. It saves you having to carry too\nmuch cash.\nOf course, they're not issued to new customers\nautomatically. Being given one is purely at the discretion\nof your bank manager. But anyone over 18 can apply for\none at the branch where the account is kept.\n\n"

M.'S) Introduction.\nUnion General Meetings decide overall policy of the\nUnion and also provide the Union with the opportunity of \"checking up\" on its officers. UGM's are conducted according to a set of standing orders.\nThe Chair.\nIt is the job of the Chairperson to ensure that the meeting is kept in order i.e. that it is conducted according to the Standing Orders.\nIf you feel the t the meeting is not being conducted correctly you should:-a. Make a \"point of order'. That is to question whether a Standing Order is being properly complied with.\nb.If you disagree with the Chairperson's ruling then you should challenge\nhis/her ruling. Standing Orders.\nStanding Orders detail how motions and amendments should be taken.\nInformation.\nStanding Orders also define how to ask questions or give information. To do\nthis shout \"Information\" and if the speaker accepts your point of Information you\nwill be allowed to speak (These points of information are not allowed at all during a summing up speech).\nProcedural Motions. (See section 20 of Standing Orders)\nIf you get bored with a particular motion or if you think a wrong decision was\ntaken on a previous matter or if you want to do something that Standing Orders\ndoes not allow you to do or if you want the meeting to end and items on the agenda\nto go to another one or if you want to discuss a particular motion at a later\nmeeting or if you don't like a particular speaker or if you don't want to vote on\na_ particular amendment, you can move one of the procedural motions listed in Section 20.\nProcedural Motions can be moved at any time during a debate as long as someone is not speaking at the time. The acceptance of a procedural motion however is at the\nChairpersons discretion. It is no mal practise to take one speech in favour and one against procedural\nmotions and then a vote.\nAgenda.\nAgenda is usually in following order:\na. Minutes of t* tt Meeting.\nThis is merely to check that the minutes produced are a true record of the\nlast meeting.\nb. Officers Reports.\nOfficers reports are presented so that you can check that an officer is fulfilling the job as detailed in her/his job description and as previous\nUnion General Meetings have requested. Most reports will be in sections:\ni) Questions to reports: If you do not understand a section of the report,\nand feel it is not detailed enough you can ask a question to the\nOfficer concerned.\nii) Moving Back of Reports: If you are still not satisfied you can move\nback a section of the report. \"Moving Back\" simply means that the\nUnion does not accept that a report either because action taken was\ninappropriate or because it was insufficient. Reports sometimes\ncontain proposals which arc voted on seo e rate ly.c. Motions: Any member of the Union, who can find a second er ran out a motion\nto a Union Meeting.\nMotions handed in7 days before the meeting must always appear on the agenda.\nOther motions are only accepted at the Chairpersons discretion. After a proposing speech has been made to a motion ANYBODY (who can find\na second er) CAN MOVE AN AMENDMENT. Write the amendment down and hand it to the Chair then you will get the opportunity to sp^ak to amendments.\nOnly one amendment is discussed at any one time.\nIf an amendment is passed it replaces the original motion and becomes the\n\"Substantive\" motion. Amendments can continue to be made to the substantive.\nAfter all amendments have been taken there is discussion on the substantive\nmotion.\nOnly when the motion itself is passed has the Union adopted any policy. Any motion can be passed as long as it does not contradict tbe By-Laws,\nor its appendices or the Standing Orders. However all these documents can\nbe amended by procedures outlined in them.\nIF YOU ARE EVER CONFUSED, OR DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO,\nASK A QUESTION TO THE CHAIR.\nPhysics Building, level8 Thurs. Oct. 4th at 8.00 pm\n-A chance to meet Maths. &\nPhysics staff & other students.\nAdmission free to MOPSOC members\nMembership (only 50p) on the door.\nCOUNSELLING What? Who? Where? When? How? September\nThe Student Counselling Service is available to any\nstudent who is encountering problems of a social,\ndomestic, personal or other nature.\nIf the Counsellor cannot help directly, he may nevertheless be able to suggest someone who can.\nMr Don Adlington.\nThe Health Department, 14 Prince's Gardens. The\nStudent Counselling Service is, however, independent of\nthe health service, the administration and the academic\nstaff, and is strictly confidential.\nMondays to Fridays, between !0.00 and 17.00 hours,\npreferably by a ppi on t ment. If there is some urgency,\nhowever, Mr Adlington will see students on any given\nday without appointment - though this may entail a short wait.\nAppointments may be made by telephoning Interna!\nNo. 4205, or through the main College switchboard\n(ext. 1036), direct to Mr Adlington; or through the\nHealth Department receptionist (Internal No. 4271); or\nby calling in at the Health Department.\n\n"

II IMPERIAL COLLEGE YOUTH HOSTELLING ASSOCIATION\nAs stated in the IC Union Handbook,\nImperial College Youth Hostelling\nAssociation (ICYHA) is the recreational\nclub you should join if you wish to 'get\naway from it all'. One has only to look\nback over the preceding year's activities\nto see just how successful the club has\nbeen in it's aim to flee from London.\nDuring the autumn and spring terms\ntrips were arranged to the Brecons, Lake\ndistrict, Snowdonia, South Downs and\nYorkshire. A* Easter a party went to\nScotland, and for three weeks during the\nsummer another trip to the Austrian\nTyrol and the Alsace region of France\nwas undertaken.\nOn arrival at our various destinations\npeople are free to do as they please. In\nthis way we hope to appeal to the walker,\nclimber, skier, cyclist, canoeist, photographer and nature lover.\nTravel is by minibus, and the transport\ncosts incurred are sub sidi sed by the\nRC C. Whilst away, we stay in Youth\nHostels, 'huts' or tents and take our own\nfood with us. In this way costs are\nminimise d. In order to arrange our trips away, and\nalso to get to know other members of the\nclub, we meet on Thursday lunch times\nin Southside Upper Lounge for 'but ties'. In addition to these rather informal\noccasions, we do also visit some very\npleasant London restaurants to sample\n'haute cuisine'.\nHaving wetted your a ppe it it e then, we\nlook forward to seeing you at Freshers\nFair, where we will be only too pleased to\ndiscuss our activities in more detail.\nANNE LEECH\nICYHA Publicity Officer\nA MESSAGE FROM DRAMSOC\nImperial College Dramatic Society is a congenial group of people who sit at the\ntop of the Union Building, make props,\ndrink tea, and watch the College go.\nIn return for this privilege we put on\n2 1/2 productions a year, organise the\nlighting for numerous parties( everything from Fred's21st to the\nSilwood Annual Ball) and go on theatre\nvisits.\nDramsoc can be found on the Union\nEast Staircase (above the Union Office)\non the floor below the top.The door is\nusually open and tea is always brewing.\nIn particular we are short of people\nwilling to work backstage, no previous\nexperience needed.\nActors welcome.\nActresses particularly welcome.\nE.m mmm mmm mmm RAILWAY SOCIETY\nTo most people the mention of\n'Railway Society' immediately conjures\nup visions of spotty little kids in scruffy\nmacs standing on railway stations\nmaking a lot of noise and scribbling\ndown train numbers.\nIn ICRS this image is very far from the\ntruth, and to prove it the society\nundertook a continental tour this\nsummer.- It proved to be a veritable\ncultural feast incorporating such Meccas of the railway scene as\nBeauvais Cathedral, Eiffel Tower, Notre\nDame, Arc de Triomphe, a Jazz concert,\nvarious Spanish swimming pools and\nbeaches, Bastille Day celebrations and a considerable quantity of local vino. The\nwhole expedition was undertaken in a college minibus and we camped at a number of off-beat places. We ate like\nLords, enjoying Waitrose soup, ravi olli meatballs and marmalade deep in the\nSpanish interior. Among our major\ndiscoveries were that the Spanish don't call beer-beer, which caused not a few\nproblems early on.\nIn our spare time we even managed to\nvisit one preserved and two industrial\nrailways which were operated by steam\nlocomotives.\nIf you want to hear more about this\ntrip, and the events which have been\narranged for this session, including a talk on the first ever trip by British\nenthusiasts to China (they ended up\nvisiting a wide range of porcelain\nfactories), come along to our\nIntroductory Meeting at 5.40pm in Mech\nEng 640 on Tuesday 9 October.\nIC ISLAMIC SOCIETY\ninvites everyone to join\nthem at the FRESHER' FAIR\nThe Committee will be pleased to help\nanyone with difficulties in performing\nan Islamic way of life - see us at the fair.\nThe final bow at the end of a Dramsoc\nproduction\nBRITISH RED CROSS SOCIETYIMPERIAL COLLEGE DETATCHMENT\nThe Imperial College British Red\nCross Society is unique in that it is the\nonly such establishment within a University campus in the British Isles. It\nconsists of a Voluntary Aid Detachment\nand a Members' Group.\nThe Voluntary Aid Detachment is\nmade up of uniformed personnel\nqualified in First Aid and Nursing who\nprovide First Aid facilities as required\nwithin the London area.\nWe have recently acquired a Ford\nTransit Ambulance, furnished with the\nmost up-to-date equipment which is\nbased here at Imperial College and may\nbe found parked beneath the Sherfield\nbuilding.\nThe Members' Group primarily acts as\na social welfare volunteers group within\nthe local community: hospital visiting,\nescorting disabled and elderly persons\nand assisting with the mentally\nhandicapped.\nThe Society provides opportunities\nfor any member of the College, whether\nstudents or staff, to learn First Aid and\nNursing and invites You to come along\nand learn how to cope in the event of an\naccident or illness.\nWe are holding an Introductory\nMeeting on THURSDAY 4th OCTOBER\nat 6.30pm in the Botany/Zoology\nCommon Room (under the Union Arch),\nwhere you will have an opportunity to\nsee what courses are available, to meet\nwith existing members and to inspect\nthe Detachment ambulance.\nSee us at Freshers' Fair on the\nQueen's Lawn and in the Bot/Zoo\nCommon Room and watch out here in\nFELIX for future Red Cross announcements.\nFor details contact:\nDetachment Commandant: - Roger\nSerpell Int.
