    "content": "ARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 FRIDAY 28 SEPT\nArianna Sorba\nArts Editor\n5 POSTERS FOR YOUR BEDROOM WALL\n1. Chinese Girl\nNow one of the most popular art\nprints of all time, the original Chinese\nGirl recently sold for almost \u00a31 million\nin a London auction. It was painted\nin 1950 by Russian artist Vladimir\nTretchiko\ufb00 after he spotted the model\nfor the painting in a laundrette.\nhe quirky contrast between the\ngirl\u2019s blue skin, red lips and gold\ncollar, combined with that fabulous\nhair, mean the painting has come to\nembody the 1950s kitsch aesthetic.\nIn fact it\u2019s so iconic that if you\nlook carefully you can \ufb01nd it in the\nbackground throughout popular\nculture, from Father Ted to Monty\nPython to a David Bowie music video.\n2. Tennis Girl\nPopular for perhaps a slightly di\ufb00erent\nreason, Tennis Girl started life as a\ncalendar published for the Queen\u2019s\nSilver Jubilee in 1977. But it soon went\nthe 1970s equivalent of viral, and sold\nover 2 million copies across the world.\nIt\u2019s not just the impeccable timing\nof this photograph that makes it so\nsuccessful. It\u2019s very intelligently com-posed, with the afternoon sun beautifully framing the girl in a halo of light,\ncutting her \ufb01gure dramatically against\nthe soft greenery of the background.\nhere are, after all, plenty of posters\ngoing around that have a bum in them.\nNot all of them have stood the test of\ntime quite like this one.\n3. Lord Kitchener Wants\nYou\nLord Kitchener, or to give him his full\nname, Field Marshal Horatio Herbert\nKitchener the 1st Earl Kitchener, was\nthe British Secretary of State for War\nduring World War One. And he wanted you.\nAnd with that moustache, who could\ndare say no? he image, originally\ngracing the cover of the in\ufb02uential\nLondon Opinion magazine, became\none of the most iconic posters of all\ntime when it was used extensively -and successfully - to recruit millions\nof volunteers to \u2018Kitchener\u2019s Army\u2019.\nhe boldness and simplicity of the\nimage, with that terrifying pointing\n\ufb01nger, have since spawned countless\nimitations.\n4. Campbell\u02bcs Soup Can\nAndy Warhol produced his set of\n32 Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans prints in\n1962, at the very birth of the Pop Art\nmovement. Displayed together, the\n32 images are identical save for the\n\ufb02avour\u2013 but it is apparently widely\nknown that his favourite was tomato.\nhe mechanised printing method\nused for production and the\nbanal subject matter meant many\ncontemporary critics said that it\nwasn\u2019t even art, let alone good art.\nBut, 50 years later, people are still\ntalking about the clean lines, striking\nimagery and cultural symbolism\nof Warhol\u2019s work. So he must have\ndone something right. (Can you spot\nanother version of Campbell\u2019s Soup\nCan on this page? If so, you win \ufb01ve\npoints and an air of smugness. -Ed.)\n5. Nighthawks\nPainted in New York in 1942, Nighthawks is a real beauty of an Edward Hopper\npainting, and easily one of his most famous pieces of work.\nhe contrast between the murky gloom of the street and the harsh light\ninside makes the picture ooze a kind of mysterious, melancholy atmosphere.\nEerie shadows are cast onto the pavement by the same unnatural light that also\nilluminates the lonely \ufb01gures inside the diner. here\u2019s a sense of isolation in the\npicture, as all three guests seem to be lost in their own thoughts, but there\u2019s also\na sense of quiet dignity in their stillness.\nAnd the worst poster for your bedroom wall? KEEP CALM AND [insert\nsomething stupid here]. Just no.\nArianna\u2019s Offers\nNational heatre \u201cEntry Pass\u201d\nMembership for 16-25 year olds\nthat gets you \u00a35 tickets to all their\nproductions, access to exclusive\nworkshops and events, as well as\nthe usual discounts in the shops\nand cafes\nRoyal Opera House \u201cStudent\nStandby\u201d\nStudents can sign up to gain access\nto any unsold opera and ballet\ntickets a few days before the event\nfor just \u00a310, as well as advanced\nbooking periods for every single\nperformance\nCheck out these sweet deals from\nworld-renowned dance and theatre\nvenues that can get you cheaper\ntickets, better seats and more.

It helps that the QS League\nTables just got updated earlier this\nmonth to show Imperial rising to its\ngreatest heights ever \u2013 hats o\ufb00 to Civ.\nEng., how does it feel to be on top of\nthe world? \u2013 just as we all start/resume\nour college adventure. (A selection\nof up-to-date rankings is shown\nin a table if you want to feel good\nabout yourself while you still can.)\nAll summer, during and after waiting\naround for your offers and crapping\nyour pants on the eve of Results Day,\nyou\u2019ve probably done your fair share of\nputting down UCL and tried to publicly\nbelieve that Oxbridge don\u2019t know what\nthey\u2019re missing with you headed here.\nFurthermore, with the updated rankings\nshowing just where we purportedly\nstand in the world\u2019s grand scheme of\nthings, you might have started to believe\nyou\u2019re something special, headed for\nThe Chosen College, destined for\ngreatness and buzzing to meet other\nwhiz-kids/some legendary old people.\nYou might expect to be herded into\na factory of educational brilliance\nwhere you enter with A*A*A*A* and\nexit with a job at Google/JPMorgan\nlike clockwork. You might expect\nto command awe and respect from\nyour peers at other institutions just\nby telling them where you study. You\nmight expect Imperial to have all\nthe best facilities and most modern\ntechnologies implemented on campus\nand available for your learning benefit.\nYou might expect that everyone around\nyou knows just as much advanced\nmathematics and physics as you do.\nOf course, rankings are a vague and\ngeneralmeasureofhowwellauniversity\nis doing in a broad sense. But, the\nabove is not what these rankings imply,\nor are even necessarily a measure of.\nBy the time you read this, you may\nalready have figured that with such\na diverse and international student\nbody, not everyone has had a similar\neducational background. For instance,\nengineers may struggle with first-year\nMathematics topics because they hadn\u2019t\ntaken Further Maths like you had, or\nmaybe their country\u2019s Maths syllabus\nwasn\u2019t as content-heavy. Don\u2019t ever\nTop spot MIT/real life Tetris\nWiki Commons\nUniversity Rankings\nand what you should (not) make of them\nWriter\nShiladitya Ghosh\nmistake that for a lack of intelligence\n\u2013 they worked hard to get here, and\nare probably just as deserving as you.\nYou will notice that criteria such\nas \u2018Research Excellence\u2019 and \u2018StaffStudent Ratio\u2019, prominent features in\nseveral ranking methodologies will\nhardly have any bearing on how your\nfirst few undergraduate years go. The\ngenerous college endowment and\nbudgets will never really seem to be\ntrickling down to furnish your lecture\ntheatre (LT) with swiveling seats\nand touchscreen desks. For naming\nourselves the Imperial College of\nScience, Technology, and Medicine,\nyou will see sluggishness in unexpected\nplaces on the technological front \u2013 just\nkeep track of how many months it ends\nup taking for every department to have\na couple of LTs to finally be configured\nfor AV recordings of lectures.\nYou will come to realise that\nunfortunately, top jobs aren\u2019t being\nprepared to be handed to you on a plate\nonce you pass your degree. There are\nonly a handful of those jobs to begin\nwith \u2013 chances are you won\u2019t be getting\none if you sit around feeling entitled.\nThat\u2019s why we need, and have, regular\nCareers Fairs on campus, for you to find\nout that employers do like Imperial, but\nhailing from here isn\u2019t enough to make\nthe cut since they also like Oxbridge,\nLSE, the Ivies, etc. You have to do\nstuff. Partying twice every week will\nlook doubly distasteful to employers\nif you don\u2019t show you can handle\nresponsibility and make productive use\nof your free time by contributing to a\nfew Clubs/Societies during your time\nhere. (Incidentally while I was writing\nthis, Bloomberg just published an\narticle saying Imperial graduates now\nhave the best job prospects in the UK\n(89% employed within 6 months of\ngraduation,aheadofCambridge(85%)).\nyour year group there are people who\nare both smarter and better than you,\nwho will effortlessly breeze through\nexams and coursework in their sleep\nwhile maintaining a social life, and\nthere are also people slower than you\nwho will have to put in long shifts after\nlectures at the library, poring over the\nlecture notes to understand things you\nthought were easy enough. You may\nidentify with the latter group, and\nmay come to know brighter and more\nadmirable individuals at other colleges\nlike UCL or even King\u2019s, who will\ngreatly trouble your self-esteem and\nmake you wonder what you are doing\nhere. But you have to remember, no one\never said you\u2019re better than other people\njust because you\u2019re in Imperial, and it\u2019s\nnot necessarily true at all. The fact that\nyou\u2019re here means that the College/\nDepartment admissions team thought\nyou have great potential on top of your\nundoubted academic prowess. Don\u2019t\nforget to be humble and keep developing\nyourself all the time. Take chances to\nlearn from anybody and everybody.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019re surrounded by\npeople who don\u2019t necessarily seem\nall that amazing. It\u2019s because they\u2019re\nnot amazing yet, but by the time they\ngraduate, after they have interacted\nwith similarly amazing people, they\nwill be. And hopefully, so will you.\nSomewhat in contradiction, you will\nhave to realise that studying a top-rated\ncourse in a top-rated college won\u2019t\nautomatically make you awesome, but\npeople will expect you to be awesome\nand be doing awesome things all the\ntime anyway. You will feel pressurised\nto make full use of everything available\nto you. Which is when you will start to\ndoubt what you have around you: \u201chey\ncome to think of it, I don\u2019t really feel like\nI\u2019m in the world #1 place for my course.\nIt\u2019s great but\u2026#1? Really? I thought\nthere would be more than this.\u201d Reality\nis always underwhelming, isn\u2019t it?\nUnfortunately, the hard truth is that\nthe only major way you influence\nthese rankings are through your\nNational Student Satisfaction (NSS)\nsurvey (when you graduate), and how\nquickly you find a job upon graduation.\nMost of the score is contributed to by\nPostgraduate students and researchers\nat the College who are frantically\nchurning out theses and papers, and to\nwhom factors like \u2018Student-Staff Ratio\u2019\nare a whole lot more important in the\nhunt for a supervisor. At the end of the\nday, it\u2019s generally final-year Undergrads\nand more senior people who get to\nmuck about with the \u2018world-class\u2019\nfacilities the College has, and it\u2019s what\nthey do that\u2019s published to the world,\nand whose quality is judged to form\nthe main basis of our world rankings.\nBut all this doesn\u2019t mean Imperial is\na lousy place for an Undergrad to be at\n(though I did suggest to you earlier to\nfeel good about yourself while you still\ncould.) You\u2019re going to spend between\n3-6 years here; most Postgrads are\nonly here for either 1 or 4 years, plus\nyou outnumber them 3:1 \u2013 it would be\nfoolish for the College to fail to cater\nto you and your abilities\u2026and no one\u2019s\nsaying it does. This article merely\nserves to explain to you what the\ncurrently-published ranking systems do\nand do not imply about your Undergrad\nexperience at Imperial because\nthey do not factor in much about\nUndergraduates. There simply isn\u2019t\nany real ranking system for universities\nfrom an Undergraduate perspective out\nthere (or at least one that\u2019s not exclusive\nto US colleges) so we can\u2019t say for sure.\nCould Imperial be argued to\nbe the World #1 University for\nUndergraduates? Sure, it\u2019s possible\n(though unlikely). But no one\u2019s manage\nto agree on a set of standard criteria\nto quantify this. Maybe you can try.\nSam\nple of Rank\nings:\n\u2022 Q\nQS World Rankings: 2013-14\no Overall: 5th\no Engineering and technology-6th\n(w\norld), 2nd\n(UK)\no Life sciences and m\nedicine-14th\n(w\norld), 3rd\n(UK)\no Natural science- 9th\n(w\norld), 3rd\n(UK)\no Civil Engineering \u2013 1st\n(w\norld)\n\u2022 T\nTimes Higher Education Rankings: 2012-13\no Overall: 8th\no Engineering and technology-10th\n(w\norld)\no Life sciences \u2013 10th\n(w\norld)\no Physical sciences \u2013 17th\n(w\norld)\no Clinical Health/Medicine \u2013 5th\n(w\norld)\n\u2022 G\nGuardian University Guide: 2014\no Overall: 9th\n\u2022 C\nComplete University Guide: 2013\no Overall: 4th\nThese statistics,\nwhile very\nheartening and\ngood to know,\nalso perpetrate the\nmyth propounded\nupon at the start\nof this paragraph.\nJust keep in mind\nthat our seniors\nworked hard to\nget their jobs no\nmatter how easy it\nsounds now, and\nyou will have to\ndo so to match up\nto their statistic.)\nYou will come\nto grudgingly\nadmit (at least to\nyourself) that in\n\n"

    "content": "11\nFRIDAY 28 SEPT\nARTS\n@feliximperial\nfacebook.com/FelixImperial\nFred Fyles investigates the new Designers in Residence\nW\nhat makes us\nwho we are? he\nanswers that\ni m m e d i a t e l y\nspring to mind\nare personal, intimate in\ufb02uencesour parents and siblings, friends and\nteachers; but there is one unlikely\n\ufb01gure that has a profound and almost\ninvisible impact on our lives - the\nDesigner. From the clothes we wear\nto the cars we drive and the websites\nwe visit, the designer has an enormous\nrole in forging our individual identity.\nIt is this theme, one of \u2018identity\u2019,\nwhich has formed the basis of the\nDesign Museum\u2019s Designers in\nResidence programme. Running\nsince 2008, each year the programme\nselects four up-and-coming\ndesigners, exhibiting their work and\nexploring what design means to us.\nPerhaps the most direct link\nbetween designers and identity\nis found in the realm of product\ndesign. How things are made, and\nhow we interact with them, helps\nto form a sense of both individual\nand national identity. his idea of\ninteraction has been explored in the\nwork of Eunhee Jo who, after studying\nin her native Seoul, completed\npart of her Design Engineering\nMasters at Imperial College.\nFor the residency, Jo designed a\nspeaker system and lighting array that\nexamine what the future of product\nidentity may be. Rather than use the\nglass and steel that seem to be the\nprescribed vision of the future, she\nhas researched the use of fabrics as a\nform of technological interface. he\nlights and the front of the speaker,\nfor example, are both covered with\na soft fabric that responds to tactile\nin\ufb02uences \u2013 intuitive gestures such as\nswiping back or forth allow the user\nto change songs, lower the volume,\nor illuminate the lights. Jo has spoken\nabout the idea of \u2018emotional design\u2019\nin her work, and the fabric allows\nanother level of interaction with the\nproduct, creating a bond between the\nobject and the consumer. \u201cI imagined\nthe vision of the future to be very\norganic\u201d, says Jo of her work. \u201che\nfabric I use in this project is more\nlike skin\u201d. With current developments\nin smart textiles, it seems that this\nvision of the future may not be far o\ufb00.\nWhile designers have a strong\nin\ufb02uence in our lives, the most\npowerful in\ufb02uence on our identity\nover the last ten years has undoubtedly\nbeen the role of the internet in our\nlives. With over 80% of households\nin the country having access to the\ninternet, more people than ever before\nare using it as their own personal\nspace, to express, confess, and emote.\nIn our \u2018post-internet\u2019 world, personal\nidentity is con\ufb02icted - we constantly\nexperience a relentlessly intense\nbarrage of information, making\nit di\ufb03cult to know who we are.\nAdam Nathaniel Furman, the\nsecond designer in residence, was\nborn in 1982, placing him at the\nforefront of the millennial generation,\nand his multi-faceted work identi\ufb01es\nwhat it is like to be a young person\nin today\u2019s world. Alongside a collage\n\ufb01lm that bombards the viewer with\nimages, videos, and sounds, Furman\nhas created a \ufb01ctitious character who\nblogs about the anxiety of modern life.\nhese themes lead to his main work \u2013\na series of colourful, complex ceramic\nvases, produced using 3D printers.\nBulbous or angular, colourful or\nmonochrome, these vases display the\nwide range of in\ufb02uences that can be\nfound through the internet, and re\ufb02ect\nthe culture-mashing that has been\nbrought on through globalisation.\nEverything in Furman\u2019s work - the\nblog, the video, and the designs for\nthe vases - exist in a digital format,\nreinforcingtheroletechnologyplaysin\nforging our identity, and the shift away\nfrom handicraft in modern design.\nWhile Furman\u2019s pieces focus on\nwhat it means to emote and connect\nacross the world, there is a dark\nunderbelly to the internet that is not\nmentioned; everything we do on the\ninternet, every click and every \u2018like\u2019,\ncan be converted into valuable market\ndata. In this way our internet identity is\nmined by multinational corporations,\nwho can then deliver targeted\nadvertisements straight to our screen.\nhomas hwaites\u2019 work explores\nthis idea, but \ufb02ips it on its head and\nadds a delicious lick of black humour.\nHe has created a series of theoretical\nproducts that monitor our lives,\nand guide us towards better choices.\nNamed Nabu - after the Babylonian\ngod of wisdom and writing - the key\npiece in the collection is a wireless\nrouter that connects permanently\ninto a household\u2019s devices, gathering\ndata to form an idea of their identities.\nAfter a few weeks it begins to\nplace restrictions on the internet\nand television, forcing people to\navoid what Nabu decrees to be \u2018bad\ndecisions\u2019 - a bit like Richard haler\u2019s\n\u2018Nudge heory\u2019, taken to the extreme.\nhe instruction manual for Nabu\nemphasises the centrality the icon-like router should play in life, forming\nwicked parallels between the internet,\nreligion, and government control.

While these devices may\nseem outlandish, hwaites\u2019 work\nforces the viewer to question how\nwe make decisions, and whether free\nwill truly exists in the Internet Age.\nWhile these three projects are\nresolutely looking towards to future,\nChloe Meineck\u2019s work takes a di\ufb00erent\ndirection, instead going back in the\npast. For the residency she developed\na \u2018Music Memory Box\u2019, which\nlinks personal objects to sounds,\ncreating multi-faceted memories.\nMeineck is particularly interested in\nusing the device with Alzheimer\u2019s\npatients - since many studies suggest\nthat memories of music remain\nunimpaired in those with the disease,\nthe box can become a form of therapy\nfor the patient, their carers, and their\nfamily. he work uses Radio Frequency\nIdenti\ufb01cation (RFID) technology\nlinked to MP3 \ufb01les to transform\nmemories into something tangible.\nMeineck hopes that the box could\nplay an important role in helping\nthe family to cope with the e\ufb00ects\nof the disease; \u201cfor their families\nthere is a sense of capturing as\nmuch as possible\u201d, she says. \u201cAs the\ndementia gets worse the ownership\nchanges, and the family members\nstart owning the box\u201d. his work\nshows that, although most modern\ntechnology seems to be continuing\nits unstoppable march of progress\ntowards the future, there will always\nbe a role for re\ufb02ecting on the past.\nAs the world becomes more and\nmore connected, and we are assaulted\nwith more and more information,\nit becomes harder to keep track of\npersonal and national identities.\nhe designer tries to make sense of\nthis confusing world, condensing\nthe unstable miasma of modern\nculture into something tangible,\nsomething permanent. he four\ndesigners displayed at the Design\nMuseum are paragons of this idea\nof the \u2018new designer\u2019, and it is ideas\nsuch as theirs that help maintain our\nidentity in this post-internet society.\nAn Eye for An Identity?\nTHE DESIGN MUSEUM\nWhat: Designers in Residence 2013\nExhibition\nWhere: The Design Museum, London\nWhen: 4th Sept 2013 \u2013 12th Jan 2014\nPrice: \u00a310.75 Adults, \u00a36.50 students\nTHE DESIGN MUSEUM THE DESIGN MUSEUM THE DESIGN MUSEUM\nAdam Nathanial Furman\nProduces ceramic vases using 3D\nprinters.

    "content": "Spencer Bennett goes on a lads holiday (they even got matching shirts)\nT\nour began on the \ufb01nal\nFriday of the summer term.\nAmongst the celebrations,\nthat are usual at this time\nof year, there was a sense\nof trepidation amongst some of the\nyounger members of the touring\nparty. What lay ahead was the\nfootball club\u2019s summer tour to Poland\nby the end of which this feeling of\ntrepidation had been truly justi\ufb01ed.\nAfter a feast of Librarian\u2019s Michelin\nstarred Bizzquick\u00a9 the 22 of us began\nthe journey to Krakow. K.Arthur arrived just in time with another story\nto add to his growing anthology. he\nhostel sta\ufb00 in Krakow were treated to\nour unique culture of box (which the\nUnion\u2019s patrons enjoy week in week\nout) with the traditional tour addition\nof bong. Our \ufb01rst night in Krakow was\nthe scene for one of the great discoveries in human history. To the list of\nColumbus and the Americas, Newton\nand gravity, Fleming and penicillin,\nthe discovery of Shakers by ICUAFC\ncan be added. Georgia, who just hours\nearlier had been reduced to tears\nby a mop, was now delighted whilst\nS.Campbell and Marius formed a persistent wading team.\nSunday saw our \ufb01rst footballing encounter of the week against Poland.\nSpirits were high before kick-o\ufb00 and\nafter an extensive warm up we locked\nhorns with Poland. After a bright start\nby ICUAFC the experience and technical ability that is common at international level allowed Poland to gain\nthe upper hand. Despite Gayson\u2019s best\ne\ufb00orts ICUAFC found themselves 2-0\ndown at half-time. With some Spanish\n\ufb02air coming o\ufb00 the bench and Librarian taking 5 minutes to calm down\nthe second half performance showed\nsome signs of improvement with\nchances spurned by Reply all, Spaniard\n2 and (most impressively) Dr. Love. Dr.\nLove\u2019s maraud from centre back went\nunnoticed by the Poles and his gamble\nat the back stick so nearly resulted in\na headed goal. he e\ufb00ect of chasing\nthe ball began to show in the last 15\nminutes and a disappointing performance ended in a comfortable win for\nPoland. hat night the Spaniards\u2019 misery was compounded by their national\nteam\u2019s appalling performance. Napoleon\u2019s DJing was well received but\nShakers beckoned. Later, Emmanuel\nFrimpong watched on in disgust as\nSausage and Crab committed animal\nrights atrocities on Krakow\u2019s pigeons\nalthough Sausage\u2019s commitment to\nthis cause must be commended. he\nline \u201ccan you blow up my shark\u201d was\nsurprisingly successful until Spaniard\n1 decided this was dishonourable and\ncon\ufb01scated the prop.\nJewsuf de\ufb01nitely not completing the\nshooting challenge was followed by an\nafternoon of pint-seeing in the most\nbeautiful city in the world. K.Arthur\nabused a free-hug initiative and Sergei\nquoted his doctor more times than is\ndecent.\nhe next day saw ICUAFC\u2019s second match of tour this time facing up\nagainst some local street youths. A\nrousing rendition of the national anthems was followed by a cagey opening 30 seconds after which Sausage\nhad had enough and decided to give\nthe youths a head-start by throwing\nthe ball into his own net. Marius\u2019 selection policy was being called into\nquestion when Sausage produced another goalkeeping clanger to see ICUAFC 2-0 down early on. he massed\ncrowds watched aghast as Gruby Lysy\nproduced a spectacular overhead kick\nand Spaniard 3 took an unprovoked\ndive. In the second half goals from\nLibrarian and Marius, the \ufb01rst a deft\nchip over the keeper and the second\na casual pile-driver from range, were\nnot enough to earn victory against the\ntenacious youths. Live music helped\nus forget the day\u2019s defeat and our \ufb01nal\nnight in the most beautiful city in the\nworld saw Librarian bring dishonour\non his family as No stood watch from\nhis outpost in shakers and Georgia\u2019s\nsel\ufb01es reached new heights.\nhe coach journey to Wroclaw\nbegan with some shock revelations\nwhich Blue Steel found di\ufb03cult to\naccept. Napoleon was crowned the\nsecond most hated man in the club\n(Myles Jarvis just pipping him) and\n\u201c6/10, house party\u201d was repeated\nseveral times. A combination of\nS.Campbell\u2019s awful musical taste, a\nfour hour wait in tra\ufb03c and the necessity for Spanish penises never to\npiss alone meant that morale was low\nupon arrival in Wroclaw. his was not\nhelped by Spaniard 1\u2019s determination\nto shower his homeland in honour\nregardless of the accuracy of his tales.\nHowever, the beauty of Wroclaw combined with Shambolic\u2019s love of hotties\nled to a pleasant evening. he next\nday\u2019s dinner was rudely interrupted\nby some unwelcome visitors who were\nsuitably punished for the presence.\nCrab made a swift exit to propose to\nlocal children leaving a furious Blue\nSteel with the bill. By this point bowel\ncontrol was becoming an issue with\nK.Arthur and No retiring early.\nOur \ufb01nal encounter saw ICUAFC\ntake on Wroclaw Institute of Technology. As both teams felt each other\nout in the opening stages it was the\nhome side that were nearly gifted an\nearly goal by a hilarious misjudgement\nby Phone Shop in goal. Charging out\nof his area our stand-in keeper could\nonly watch as the ball bounced high\nover his head. Fortunately, \ufb01nishing\nability appeared not to be an entry\nrequirement for our opponent\u2019s team.\nWith Gayson pulling the strings up\ntop and Spaniard 1 having the game\nof his life ICUAFC gained the upper\nhand without ever threatening the\ngoal. On the stroke of half time the\nhome side grabbed a goal that proved\nto be decisive. Despite a late maraud\nfrom Phone Shop and goal line heroics from Georgia and Dr. Love a 1-0\ndefeat was the only reward for a solid\nperformance which was always going\nto have an end of tour feeling to it.\nHaving been mesmerized by Librarian for the previous 90 minutes the\nbumper crowd of 17 showed their ap-preciation, as did the rest of the team,\nand he was inevitably awarded player\nof tour. Honourable mentions to Dr.\nLove, Emma\u2019s \ufb01t, Georgia and Sausage\n(Sausage!) who also gave inspirational\nperformances over the week.\nhere was time for just one more\npiwo before the squad headed home\nto bask in the memories and pain that\nthe previous week had created. A wise\naeronautics PhD student once said\nthat by the end of tour you will want\nto go home. He was yet again proven\ncorrect.\nTour de Football: Poland Edition\nMACIEJ WITKOWSKI\n\u201cKeep the\nCat Free\u201d\n28/09/13\nIssue 1553\nfelixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nGame to edit?

Not a suicide this time like Mary Alice Young,\nbut a murder of a maid, Flora (Paula\nGarces), who was working for Adrian (Tom Irwin, effectively creepy\nand slimey) and Evelyn Powell (the\nexcellent, irreplaceable Rebecca\nWisocky who acts as comedy gold in\nevery episode she\u2019s in).\nHer friends Carmen (Roselyn\nSanchez), Rosie (Dania Ramirez),\nZoila (Judy Reyes) and Valentina\n(Edy Ganem) are devastated but\nhardly surprised, given what Flora\nwas really up to.\nBut life goes on. Carmen, working\nfor the famous Latin recording artist Alejandro Rubio (Matt Cedeno),\ndreams of one day becoming a pop\nsensation herself. Although working\nunder Odessa (Melinda Page Hamilton), a mean Russian who rules over\nhousehold with an iron fist is no easy\ntask.\nRosie is under tremendous pressure working in the household of\nPeri Westmore (Mariana Klaveno),\na self-absorbed actress and her has-been soap opera actor Spence (Grant\nShow) who she has an inappropriate\ncrush on.\nZoila also has her plates full, dealing with her hilariously ditzy boss\nGenevieve (Susan Lucciww). Further adding to her list of things to\nworry about is her daughter Valentina\u2019scrushonGenevieve\u2019sson,Remi\n(Drew Van Acker).\nThe arrival of Marisol (Ana Ortiz),\na new maid at Michael (Brett Cullen) and Taylor Stappord\u2019s (Brianna\nBrown) house, and her link to Flora\u2019s\nmurder is the season\u2019s long-running\nmystery. Why is Marisol asking\nquestions about her? Who killed\nFlora? What exactly was Flora doing\nthat put her in so much danger?\nBehind the expensive doors of the\nBeverley Hills mansions that are\nquite simply out of this world, these\nLatina maids work tirelessly, picking\nup on all the gossip and dirty laundry of their rich and famous bosses.\nLooking at the world through their\neyes, from the view of \u201cthe help\u201d is\ncertainly an interesting concept, but\none that is perhaps not utilised fully,\nas there are so many plotlines to juggle at once.\nWhen it deviates away from the\nmain murder mystery, the other subplots have a varying degree of suc-cess, mostly relying on the talents\nof its many stars to pull it off (all five\nLatina actresses are spot-on), and\nthey usually do, no matter how stale\nsome of the weekly scenarios turn\nout to be.\nThe big mystery of whodunnit is\nyet to be solved, but given the way\neverything is building up, it promises\nto deliver a season finale of shocking\nreveals. So stay tuned.\nFour successful professional career\nwomen, all of them in complicated\npersonal crises of their own - that is\nhow you describe Mistresses, the US\nremake of the hit UK show.\nSavi (Alyssa Milano) is a lawyer,\nKaren (Yunjin Kim) is a psychiatrist,\nApril (Rochelle Aytes) is a furniture\nstore owner, and Joss (Jes Macallan)\nis a real-estate agent.\nSavi and her hunky Australian\nchef husband Harry (Brett Tucker)\nare struggling to conceive and she\ncheats on him with Dominic (Jason\nGeorge), a colleague of hers.\nKarenhadanaffairwithaterminally\nill patient before prescribing him\nenough medication to kill himself.\nNow his son is distraught and seeks\nher help, not knowing the shady\nhistory between the two.\nApril\u2019s husband passed away a\ncouple of years ago and is struggling\nto be a single mother; also not\nhelping is her belief that her husband\nmay still be alive.\nJoss is the most liberated one\nof them all, decides to strike up a\nlesbian relationship, something\nwhich she\u2019s never done before, with\na client\u2019s girlfriend, even though her\nattractive foreign boss with an accent\nstarts pursuing her.\nHow these women have time for\nrelaxing coffee meetings and fancy\nlunches is anyone\u2019s guess, given the\nmagnitude of the problems going on\nin their lives, but the soapy, dramatic\ntwists are deliciously absurd at times,\nbut that is kind of the appeal of the\nshow. The characters have a knack\nfor not taking anything too seriously\nit seems, and as an easy-going drama\nthis sometimes works as a plus.\nEveryone makes bad life choices,\nand these women are experts\nwhen it comes to creating conflict\nand getting stuck in impossible\nsituations. Which is great news for\nthe audience, who only have to sit\nback and watch.\n\n"

    "content": "15\nFRIDAY 28 SEPT\nBOOKS\n@feliximperial\nfacebook.com/FelixImperial\navourite books from their library\nPicks\nAre you a seasoned veteran of the fantasy genre? Do you want\nto feel really confused even though you\u2019re more than half-way\nthrough the book? Do you want more characters than there are\nequations in your heavily theoretical dissertation? Are you crazy?\nIf the answer to any of these is \u201cyes\u201d then pick up the \ufb01rst book\nin Steven Erikson\u2019s Malazan Book of the Fallen series, Gardens\nof the Moon.\nIt takes some time to get into Gardens of the Moon, mainly\ndue to Erikson\u2019s way of exposing the story (which is throwing\nyou straight into the deep end and giving you very little help). It\nwas only when I got to part two of the book that I really started\nto appreciate the characters. here\u2019s Kruppe the consummate\nidiot who\u2019s simultaneously the smartest guy in the book; there\u2019s\nWhiskeyjack who just wants a peaceful life away from the\n\ufb01ghting; there are the immortal Ascendants with their power\ngames.\nWhilst the setting of the book is based far from reality as we\nknow it, and despite the in\ufb01nitude of sentient species, Gardens\nof the Moon and the books that follow are really quite human\nin nature. Strip away the magic and the complexity and what\u2019s\nleft is a story of human su\ufb00ering, the futility of war and quite a\ntouching story of loyalty and friendship.\nhe great thing about the Malazan series is that it\u2019s already\ncomplete. Unfortunately, it\u2019s ten books long and each book\nmakes War and Peace seem like an easy read. However, if, like\nme, you get a kick out of overcoming the challenge of reading a\nseries that has more words in it than atoms in the universe, then\nyou\u2019ve picked the right book.\nMeera Patel\nNeil Gaiman\u2019s latest novel for adults has already, quite rightly,\nreceived a great deal of praise. The book follows a young boy\ngrowing up in a large house in the country with his sister\nand their parents. However, when the suicide of their lodger\nawakens an ancient and dangerous spirit he must find help\nfrom the Hempstock family who live down the lane and are far\nmore than what they appear to be.\nWhile this may seem to be a rather standard and simple\npremise the novel, as might be expected from Gaiman\u2019s\nprevious work, goes far deeper. Told in first person and drawing\nheavily from the author\u2019s own memories of growing up this is\na highly personal work exploring how children perceive the\nworld around them. Juxtaposed with the simple rural setting is\nGaiman\u2019s well known fascination with myths and legends. These\nmore fantastical elements are masterfully used to emphasise\nboth the feelings of wonder and helplessness the protagonist, as\nall children, feels when faced with the world around him. The\nauthor is careful never to explain too much \u2013 leaving us with\nthe same feeling of wonder and strangeness. As in most good\nbooks we are left with more questions than answers.\nThis is a very short novel but not a word is wasted. Gaiman is\na master of both style and narrative. The prose instantly draws\nyou into the story and envelopes you with a incredible feeling\nof magical and melancholy nostalgia. This is an amazing book\n\u2013 one that you\u2019ll almost certainly want to read in one sitting.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nOne of Banks\u2019 stand-alone science \ufb01ction works, this is a novel\nof many facets. Set in the isolated but heavily colonised hrial\nsolar system the book follows Sharrow \u2013 an aristocrat and former\ncommander of a military \ufb01ghter squadron. Faced with a vendetta\nby a militant religious order known as the Huhsz, she gathers up\nher former war buddies to \ufb01nd the only artefact that will appease\nthe Hushz\u2019s anger \u2013 the deadly and mysterious Lazy Gun.\nhe \ufb01rst part of the book, as Sharrow and her friends scour\nthe solar system for clues to the location of the Lazy Gun, has\na wonderful feel of adventure to it \u2013 which has, in recent years,\nunfortunately become less and less common in science \ufb01ction\nworks. he novel\u2019s premise gave Banks full reign to exercise both\nhis imagination and writing skill. As the story progresses we\nencounter more and more strange and wonderful cultures and\nsettings \u2013 such a city built solely on abandoned naval vessels, a\nplanet almost entirely covered with a gigantic plant, or a millennia\nold castle inhabited by an order of monks forever chained to its\nwalls. However, Banks\u2019 main skill was making all these settings feel\nbelievable and \ufb01t together into a consistent picture.\nIndeed, soon the novel begins to paint a detailed and powerful\npicture of a complex yet decadent and near stagnant society. At the\nsame, thanks to Banks\u2019 well known mastery of characterisation, we\nget to explore how this society impacts on our protagonists \u2013 and\nhow they impact on it. his interplay between the two leads to the\nmore serious consideration of themes such as loss, the corrupting\nin\ufb02uence of power and the helpless that even the powerful feel\nwhen faced with a massive and complex universe. One could\ndescribe this novel almost as a character study \u2013 but one in which\nin which the characters include not only our protagonists but the\nvery setting itself.\nhis is a unique book \u2013 at times light and action \ufb01lled, at times\ndarker and more thoughtful \u2013 but always highly engaging. Even\namongst Banks\u2019 many other highly acclaimed novels, this stands\nout as one of the best.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nFind all of these, as well as 9000 other\nbooks, 2000 DVDs and 500 graphic novels,\nin the Science Fiction, Fantasy and Gothic\nHorror Society\u2019s very own library.

My\nday was 2008- Metric\nwas a box called DB\u2019s, Southside and\nEastside were building sites, Facebook\nwas a new thing and Justin Bieber\nwas still an embryo. It was amazing.\nBut as you prepare for the modern\nfreshers\u2019 week with your smartphones\nand status updates and hip-hop music\nand all that, there is one thing you will\nface that all freshers have faced since\nthe \ufb01rst freshers guzzled WKD from a\nhollowed out wooly mammoth tooth;\nsocial interaction.\nSocial interaction is a terrible thing\nand the less of it, the better. I think\nwe all agree on this. In fact, much of\nhuman existence is spent minimising\nthe horrors of interacting with other\nHomo Sapiens, as demonstrated by\nthe inventions of walls, monasteries,\nearphones and science degrees. But\nfor the next 7 days you will be forced,\ncajoled and conned into interacting\nwith he Other. Having now looked on\nin horror at not one but four Freshers\u2019\nWeeks, here\u2019s my guide to How Not To\nMake A Complete Idiot Of Yourself.\nDon\u02bct Buy A Kettle\nFor some reason everyone is told to\nbring a kettle with them to university\nso you can give out tea and make your\nneighbours love you. Don\u2019t. Just don\u2019t.\nI don\u2019t like tea and my Northern Irish\naccent makes me pronounce \u201ckettle\u201d\nin a way that makes English people\nlaugh at me. Obviously this only\napplies to me and not necessarily to\nyour new neighbours but my physics\ndegree didn\u2019t teach me to empathise\nso just leave that kettle at home.\nDon\u02bct Leave Your Door Open\nAgain, everyone seems to be told\nto leave their door open so new\nneighbours can just pop in to say hello\nand share stories and eat cupcakes.\nNo. People cannot be trusted and will\nlikely steal your stu\ufb00. Also they will\nlaugh at that Final Fantasy poster I\nhave. I mean you have.\nDon\u02bct Become A Lad\nCongratulations, you\u2019ve just left\nyour expensive private school and\nhave now met the \ufb01rst state educated\nperson of your life. his does not\nentitle you to put on an inexplicable\nEast London accent, call people \u201cmate\u201d\nand refer to your awful conversation\nas \u201cbanter\u201d or worse, \u201cban\u2019ah\u201d.\nDon\u02bct Give A Damn And Just Have Fun\nImperial is really bloody hard\nwork. Nothing you\u2019ve done so far\nwill prepare you for this. I went from\naveraging 98% across my A Levels to\nscraping 60% here. Imagine being\nrepeatedly and viciously beaten\naround the head by a thick metal bar.\nhat bar represents knowledge and\nthe sick bastard wielding it is this\nuniversity. his is what your next 3-4\nyears will entail. Imperial will now\nspend two weeks wiping the blood\nand tears of last year\u2019s students from\nthat metal bar. Take advantage of\nthe lull. Talk to strangers. Take shots\nfrom a cereal bowl. Join every club\nand society. Don\u2019t sleep. Steal a tra\ufb03c\ncone. Buy a top hat. Take one step\ninside an embassy and revel in the\nthrill of having one leg in Britain and\nthe other in Yemen. Return the tra\ufb03c\ncone out of social responsibility.\nhe world is your oyster. For two\nweeks. And then that oyster will be\ncracked open and swallowed whole,\nsliding slowly but inexorably down the\ngullet of this prestigious institution.\nEnjoy it while you can.\nColumnist\n@roryfenton\nRory Fenton\nUncle Rory and the rest of his \ufb02oor in Freshers\u02bc Week.

See you there!\nKOP\u2019s visit to Kenya\nKenyan Orphan Project\nKOP\nhis July Imperial College\u2019s branch of\nthe Kenyan Orphan Project set out for\ntheir annual trip to Kenya to see the\nwork that their efforts had made pos-sible. hroughout the year, the group\nhad been \ufb01nding new and novel ways\nof raising money for their cause, be it\nthrough nights out, tube collections,\nor a Valentine courier service.\nIt was with high expectations that\nthe students disembarked at Nairobi\nairport in the early morning of July\n5th. hey were not disappointed by\nany means, and extent to which they\nenjoyed the experience can be easily\nseen from the following accounts.\nhe students spent two weeks in\nwest Kenya in a town called Kisumu.\nhey had the chance to spend one\nweek in Ombeyi feeding centre and\nthe next week at Oasis of hope secondary school.\nOmbeyi Feeding centre\nhe Ombeyi feeding centre provides\nmeals regularly for orphaned or vulnerable children. It also provides a\nfresh water borehole and a water\nmanagement system on the site for\nthe whole community. his centre\nwas built by KOP funding and built by\nKOP students in 2007. Here the students helped with gardening, cooking and serving meals to children and\nthen later were able to spend time\nwith them. hey also had the chance\nto visit some of the children\u2019s\u2019 family\nand houses. his came as a big shock\nto many of the students who realised\nthe harsh realities that many of these\nyoung children face every day.\nOne of the students from the programme tells us about his experi-ences:\n\u201cI was lucky enough to visit Ombeyi\nfeeding centre in Kenya.\nhis centre feeds around 80 children who are have lost one or two of\ntheir parents or have parents who are\nunable to look after them. here are\naround 3 cooks who work very hard\nso that the children can have two\nmeals a day regularly.\nWe got stuck in straight away and\nhelped with cooking, gardening, and\ncleaning and helped with serving food\nto the children.\nWhat I enjoyed most was spending\ntime with the kids and singing and\ndancing to the games they showed\nus. I also realized how hard everyone\nworks in the centre to help these children and it was truly an inspiration..\nhe home visits made us realise how\nlucky and privileged we are. Seeing\nthe poverty and di\ufb03culties the children face made me even more determined to fundraise and stop children\nhaving to face such situations.\u201d\nOasis of Hope school\nOasis of Hope school offers secondary education at a low cost to very\nbright and motivated children from\nthe neighbouring slums who would\notherwise not have been able to afford\nsecondary education. New dormitories were built funded by KOP which\nthe students from the summer team\npainted and decorated. hey took part\nin lessons, taught health education\nand discussed gender issues with the\nchildren. Many of the KOP students\nwere very impressed by how intelligent the children were and how keen\nthey were to learn.\nAlex Lai a member from 2013 summer team had this to say:\n\u201cOasis of Hope is a huge inspiration,\nhaving 200 very talented students, the\nmajority of whom have had a tough\nupbringing. We were immersed into\ntheir daily routine from attending\ntheir lessons to doing scouts as their\nextra curricular activity. At the end\nof the week we were treated to many\nperformances from the students, such\nas poetry, drama, singing and danc-ing. hese performances showed how\ntalented these students are and how\ninspirational they could be to other\nstudents around the world.\nhe trip has had many thoughts and\nemotions from excitement and joy\nto the realization of the harsh reality\nmany face here, we only saw a small\npart of Kenya, but big changes can be\nmade to small parts. It is a trip I would\nencourage everyone to undertake, as\nnot only is it highly enjoyable but it\nopens your eyes more to the world.\u201d\nHOVIC\nhe students were also lucky to spend\nsome time in HOVIC. HOpe for Victoria\u2019s Children (HOVIC) is a weekend feeding programme for over 100\nstreet children. Street children in\nKenya face many hardships from lack\nof shelter to physical and sexual abuse.\nHOVIC helps these children by not\nonly providing meals but also helps\nwith their education development and\nmedical care. hey try and teach valuable vocational training to the children which can help them get jobs and\nbecome self su\ufb03cient so that they don\nnot have to go back to streets. KOP\nalso funds a number of street children\nthrough primary education and additional support for those within HOVIC in secondary education.\nTo ensure the children\u2019s safety KOP\nalso helped with the purchase of a\nproperty in Kisumu for \u2018night shelter\u2019\nwhere up to a 100 children can sleep\nat night safely.\nA student tells us of his experience\nvisiting HOVIC:\n\u201che HOVIC centre for street children really opened our eyes to a different side to the lives of children we had\nmet so far. he children here had been\nthrough some unimaginably traumatic lives and the centre was a way\nto allow them to be children again. We\nwere also lucky enough to be able to\nplay a game of football against them,\nwhich was actually quite a challenge.\u201d\nAfter coming back from the projects\neveryday students were able to wind\ndown and socialise at the rooftop bar.\nhey also had a chance to visit many\ncultural locations such as Kit Makai, a\nreligious place for the locals.\nA student from the trip said this\nabout the social aspect of KOP summer programme:\n\u201cAlthough in the daytime is extremely rewarding and enjoyable, the\nevents in the evenings and weekends\nare really fun and great way to get to\nknow everyone in the group. hese include karaoke and bar nights and visiting the equator and the Masai market.\u201d\nhis annual trip opens the eyes of\nmany of the students to the ugly face\nof poverty in developing countries\nsuch as Kenya and how the most vulnerable people of society suffer from\nit. he money raised is incredibly\nvaluable. he money raised by the students transforms the lives of so many\norphans and gives them a \ufb01ghting\nchance in life and to help them ful\ufb01l\ntheir dreams.\nBackground\nhe Kenyan Orphan Project (KOP)\nis a charity and society that supports\nvulnerable children and orphans in\nKenya through health, education and\nsocial welfare projects. KOP is supported by a number of UK universities including Imperial College (since\n2010) who each make a huge and valuable difference to the lives of hundreds\nof children.\nEach summer, a group of Imperial\nStudents form the summer team who\ntravel to Kisumu, West Kenya, for two\nweeks to directly work on the projects\nthat we support. You could \ufb01nd yourself teaching children about health-care, helping to build schools, playing\ngames with the children or helping\nwith the feeding programmes created\nfor street children, whilst also being\nable to explore Kenya. We place a big\nemphasis on welcoming all members\nand holding regular socials.\nWhether you\u2019re looking to personally make a difference to the lives of\nvulnerable children (whilst also seeing\nKenya\u2019s amazing wildlife, scenery and\nculture), an outlet for your creativ-ity, being involved with KOP\u2019\u2019s wider\nactivities (such as the Big Chill Music Festival) or being part of a growing society that supports extremely\nworthwhile projects, KOP has a place\nfor everyone.\nAll members are encouraged to join\nin, whether they choose to be a part of\nthe summer team or not, and we will\nhelp to support all possible fundraising ideas and challenges!\nTo \ufb01nd out more about us and how\nyou can get involved, visit our stall at\nFresher\u2019s Fair or send us an email at\ncag-kop@imperial.ac.uk\nYou can also visit the KOP website\nor follow us on Facebook by joining\nthe \u2018Imperial KOP\u2019 facebook page. he\nlinks for these respectively are given\nbelow:\nFacebook page\nhttp://www.facebook.\ncom/pages/KOP-Imperial/404156182982496?fref=ts\nFacebook group\nhttp://www.facebook.com/\ngroups/114706818558259/\nICRADIO.COM\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE RADIO\nEditor: VACANT\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

As well as giving\ndi\ufb00erent viewpoints on current\nevents, Comment showcases any\nother issues that are signi\ufb01cant to\nyour life. Whether you think that\nthe food in the JCR is actually pretty\ngood, or you feel strongly that lab\ndemonstrators don\u2019t get the credit\nthey deserve, there\u2019s always space for\nan opinion. Whether you think that\nthe Union could be doing something\nbetter, or you\u2019re pretty con\ufb01dent\nthat the Student Loans Company\nhas made it their personal mission\nto make you miserable, we want\nto know. I personally, am outraged\nthat all the paper towel dispensers\nin Blackett and Huxley have been\nreplaced with hand dryers over the\nsummer, and will quite happily wax\nlyrical about this for quite some\ntime. I think big, you see. Students\ncare what other students think, and\nso why not share your perspectives?\nAt Imperial, we\u2019re so accustomed to\nsuch diversity that it\u2019s easy to forget\nthat everybody o\ufb00ers something\nunique. Although you might not run\ninto the huge spectrum of people\nhere everyday, the variety means that\nthere are a lot of interesting things\nto be said, and Comment can be the\nplace to say them. Whether you had a\nmind-altering experience in hailand\non your gap yah, you\u2019ve just moved\nto the UK from deepest darkest Peru,\nor you spent the summer sleeping\nuntil noon and watching Jeremy\nKyle in your pyjamas; everyone sees\nthings di\ufb00erently, and everyone\nhas something interesting to say.\nEncountering other views, however\ncontroversial, helps to shape yours,\nwhether they alter your opinion, or\nclarify existing ideas in your mind.\nSome topics come up in Comment\nyear after year: sexism, TfL, and the\nworkload at Imperial, to name but a\nfew. As long as these issues persevere,\nit\u2019s important to continue to feature\nand discuss them, to stir up debate,\nrather than become complacent\nand let important topics fade into\nobscurity. If you think something\nshould change, Comment is your\nopportunity to tell people why you\nfeel strongly about it, and maybe\nTessa Davey\nComment Editor\navey\nEditor\nconvince them to feel strongly too.\nAs Freshers, we sit through dozens\nof introductory talks that tell us that\nwe\u2019re the pick of the educated litter.\n(Freshers, a game for you: send me\nan email at Comment and tell me\nhow many times in your \ufb01rst week\nyou were told you were the best. he\nsmuggest department gets nothing at\nall, but I will tell you which it is!) If\nsuch intelligent people won\u2019t stand up\nand put forward their opinions, who\nwill? We as Imperial students love to\ncomplain, but are generally reluctant\nto take action. Anyone who\u2019s ever been\nslightly dissatis\ufb01ed with their course,\nyet whined when the SOLE survey\ncame around is guilty of it (and that\u2019s\npretty much everyone).

It makes\nme feel like an old man, but I have to\ntell you Freshers, cherish your years\nat Imperial (especially your \ufb01rst year,\nthings only get harder from here).\nYes, you will be leaving behind old\nfriends and loved ones, but look at the\namazing opportunities you have here:\nLife-changing friendships, a chance to\nmake a real-life nemesis, a fresh leaf\nand a chance to really maximise your\nlife\u2019s potential. You might think you\u2019ve\nworked out your identity already and\nmaybe you even walk around thinking\nyou\u2019ve already sorted out your life\nplan, but don\u2019t be so certain. You\u2019ll\nmeet such a wide variety of people\nand be able to take part in so many\ndi\ufb00erent activities (we have over 300\nclubs for goodness sake!) that you\u2019ll\n\ufb01nd yourself changing into a new\nperson over the course of the year.\nNow, as much as you\u2019re here to\nhave fun, apparently you\u2019re also here\nto study as well, or so I\u2019ve heard.\nGranted, Imperial College is a place\nof learning, and, as you\u2019ll see in the\npullout we\u2019re doing pretty well for\nourselves in the worldwide rankings,\nhowever sometime we forget that\nlearning doesn\u2019t just have to take place\nin the library. Not to say that you\nshouldn\u2019t study but I hope that over\nthe course of the next few years while\nyou work towards your Geo\ufb00 Hurst or\nyour Trevor Nunn (or your Desmond,\nouch) you also take time out to do\nsomething fun, like write for Felix.\nhat\u2019s not shameless plugging, honest.\nhat said you\u2019ll \ufb01nd your time here\nat Imperial very stressful, but don\u2019t\nbe afraid to ask for help if you\u2019re\nstruggling, your department has\nexcellent support sta\ufb00 who are often\nvery friendly, and the Union also has a\nsupport service and is available to give\nadvice to students, as well as providing\ncheap cider and a place to hang out.\nIt\u2019s time for me to stop writing now,\nthe printer\u2019s about to call and I don\u2019t\nlike to keep him waiting. Especially\nsince he might not print the issue, look\nat what you might have missed out on!\nAnyway, I hope you have a fantastic\ntime at Imperial and on behalf of all\nthe students who work at Felix (see\nbelow), welcome to Imperial College!\nWehopeyou\u2019llenjoyreadingFelixeach\nweek and maybe you\u2019ll get involved!\nFRIDAY 28 SEPT\n\n"

Both sides are too\nbusy blaming each other for the use\nof chemical weapons. he Hu\ufb03ngton\nPost claims that 110,000 lives have\nbeen lost in this war but the exact\nnumbers are unknown. It\u2019s unfortunate to see how the revolt that started\nduring the Arab Spring has unfolded.\nhe chemical weapons dilemma:\nhe international community has\nbeen ambivalent about being involved\nin Syria due to its past failures in the\nregion.\nUS interference in Middle Eastern\ncon\ufb02icts has often ended up having\nthe opposite e\ufb00ect to what was expected when they went in. As a result,\nthe western public is against military\nintervention in Syria. Americans do\nnot want to see their country get involved in a war which does not improve the US standing in the region.\nFurthermore, after the Iraq war, they\nhave become suspicious about their\nThe summer in politics\nWell hello there all you freshers (and everybody else)! Here comes yet another year of Imperial. A small amount of us\ndo tend to have an interest in politics surprisingly enough. So if you are one of those people who likes to learn about\nworld affairs or likes to have a drunk rant, like I do, about how good or bad things are around the world, then read\non. Now is the time to empower yourself with every bit of information needed to thwart those who don\u2019t agree with\nyou. How? By reading up on the most important issues of course.\nJust an aside for all freshers: This year will pass way too quickly. No joke.\nPolitics Editor\nKartikeya\nRana\ngovernment\u2019s international interest.\nhis has caused a number of problems for President Obama. He openly\nstated recently that it would be \u2018the\nlast straw\u2019 if the Assad regime used\nchemical weapons against its own civilian population. However, now there\nseems to be \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 to\nshow the use of these weapons. As\na result, Obama has been trying to\ngather votes for an air strike in Syria.\nhis seems to be an uphill battle for\nthe president as there is overwhelming opposition to such a strike. he\nUK parliament has also voted against\nan air strike in Syria. his has made\nmatters even worse for him.\nRussia has also shown a \ufb01erce opposition to American intervention. he\nRussian president, Vladimir Putin, has\nasked Syrian o\ufb03cials to submit their\nchemical weapons to international\nagencies. As a result, Obama has\nstated that he would put an air strike\non hold if Syria submits its chemical\nweapons.\nMy Take:\nUS should not take part in air strikes\nin Syria. Assad already has enough\ntime to prepare for such an air strike.\nhe only way the air strike would be\ne\ufb00ective would be if there are ground\ntroops to support the air strike. Furthermore, there are worries within\nthe Syrian public that the air strikes\nwould result in further civilian casu-alties. Russian authorities, I believe,\nhave provided an alternative which\nthe international community should\nrespect.\nThe second important\nstory \u2013 Egypt after the\nArab Spring:\nA very rosy picture was painted about\nthe path towards which Egypt was\nheaded after the Arab Spring. However, people are becoming more and\nmore pessimistic about the future of\nthe country.\nMonths after Hosni Mubarak was\nousted from Egypt, democratic elections were held. he Freedom and\nJustice party, the political wing of the\nMuslim Brotherhood, came to power\nwith Mohammad Morsi as their lead-er. A new constitution was drafted\nwhich the West has not been in support of, as it gave he Freedom and\nJustice party immense power.\nMohammad Morsi was also losing\nsupport at home for the same reason\nas well as his inability to deal with the\neconomic issues. his resulted in a\nmassive protest around Egypt and re-sultantly military intervention.\nhe Egyptian military and democ-racy:\nhe Egyptian military took over the\nparliament on July 3rd. he head of\nthe armed forces, Gen. Abdul Fattah\nAl-Sisi, announced that the constitution has been revoked and an interim\ngovernment headed by Chief Justice\nAbdul Mansour has since been put\nin place whilst a new constitution is\ndrafted. his has led to widespread\nprotests across Egypt with Islamist\ngroups setting up camp in various\nsuburbs of Cairo. he military crackdown on these tents has also lead to\na loss of a number of lives. he BBC\nstates that according to eyewitness ac-counts, at least 40 people have died in\nthe protests.\nMy Take:\nI am quite worried about how this\nsituation will play out. It is necessary that the Muslim Brotherhood is\nmade part of the democratic process\nto prevent them from being dragged\nfurther underground. his could turn\nthem more fundamental in nature and\ngive them a concrete reason to act in\nsuch a way. However, the idea of having them in power is also dangerous to\nsecularism in the region.\nI\u2019m not against the military inter-vention, although I am against the\nmanner in which it is currently being\nconducted, but it is very important\nthat the Muslim Brotherhood remains\npart of the democratic process to\nmaintain stability in Egypt.\nThe third story \u2013 Scotland\nindependence debate:\nA referendum is to be held to see\nwhether Scotland should stay in the\nUK. he Scottish public will be asked:\n\u2018Should Scotland be an independent\ncountry?\u2019. hroughout summer, there\nwas an ongoing debate about where\nthe Scottish vote was headed. According to the BBC, the Holyrood parliament supports the vote. here is a\nstrong belief that the Scottish public\nwill be voting overwhelmingly to stay\nin the UK.\nMy Take:\nI am de\ufb01nitely in support of the refer-endum. It would give a reason for the\naggravated pro-independence protestors to calm down, regardless of how\nthe referendum goes. If the vote goes\nin their favour, then it would prove\ntheir point as valid. However, if the\nvote goes against what they expected,\nthen they would have no reason to\ncomplain. I don\u2019t understand the relevance of such a long winded debate\nabout this issue. Let\u2019s just have the\nvote and see how it goes.\nThe final story \u2013 Edward\nSnowden:\nEdward Snowden used to be a National Security Agency contractor but \ufb02ed\nto Hong Kong after revealing information about extensive phone and Internet surveillance by the CIA. he idea\nof having their privacy being breached\nwithout prior consent caused public\noutrage in the US and the rest of the\nworld.\nHe also recently revealed information about the US and UK government\n\u2018cracking online encryption\u2019. his has\nsparked further debate about internet\nsecurity. People question as to whether the technology could be grasped by\npeople outside the intelligence agencies and what implications that could\nhave.\nMy Take:\nhe case of Edward Snowden is one\nof civil disobedience. He believes that\nwhat he has done is something that\nwill uphold the liberty and freedoms\nof the US citizens. However, it is different in the sense that he has \ufb02ed\nthe country rather than staying his\nground for what he believes is right\n(as has been done by civil disobedience leaders of the past like Martin\nLuther King). What makes his departure more suspicious is the fact that he\nhas \ufb02ed to Russia. Now I don\u2019t know\nwhat his intentions are but I am rather\nsuspicious of them.\nAlso, the fact that he is losing support at home shows that not everyone\nbelieves that what he is doing is right.\nIt is one thing \ufb01ghting for a country\u2019s\nright and another to leak information\nthat can hamper the same country\u2019s\nsecurity.\nhat doesn\u2019t mean that these democratic governments have come out as\nthe good guys. It is quite scary to see\nhow much power this gives the gov-ernment. Any information could be\ntaken out of context by the government to prosecute their fellow citi-zens. his would weaken the power of\nthe democracy and it is essential that\nsomething be done about this.\nhat\u2019s all from me for now. If you have\nany comments, please contact Felix.\nMain Story \u2013 Syria\nor\na\n\n"

    "content": "43\nFRIDAY 28 SEPT\nTECHNOLOGY\n@felixtechnology\nfacebook.com/FelixImperial\nMax Eggl is dismayed after the Apple\u02bcs offering at the latest keynote\nY\net another Apple keynote has\ncome and gone, and once again\nthere is a sense of frustration\nin the air. At least that bitter taste on\nthe tongue is one I have gotten used\nto after Steve jobs died, along with\nall his intuition, drive and creativity.\nFor all the fancy technical terms that\nApple likes to throw around, they\nonce again managed to frustrate.\nEverything they revealed, was known\ntwo months in advance. Every cut\nand \ufb01nish, every new touted feature,\neven the name of the new products\nwere leaked friggin 2 months ago. No\nwow, no oohs or ahs, no wonderful\ninnovation that bowled us over. I\nremember in the past, the keynotes\nwhere something unexpected would\ncome up, and I would sit there thinking\nto myself \u201cHow epic is that?!\u201d. Now\nit\u2019s just like, \u201cYeah saw that already a\nwhile ago, and even then it was pretty\nboring.\u201d Apple used to innovate, now\nthey are just following the market and\nthis keynote proves it.\nLet us start with the two products\nthey released, the iPhone 5S and 5C.\nFirstly is the fact that they revealed\ntwo phones simultaneously a good\nsign or a bad one? One on hand it\nshows that they are ready to bow\nto consumer demand in a strange\nfashion, on the other hand it means\nthat they are willing to follow their\ncompetitors. Time will tell if this was\na good strategy.\nSo the 5C. When I \ufb01rst heard of\nthe 5C I thought that the C would\nstand for cheap, meaning that Apple\nwould \ufb01nally release a budget phone.\nBasically it a rehashed iPhone 5,\nwith very similar specs, and the big\ndi\ufb00erence being the plastic colour\npalette that the iPhone 5C utilises.\nhe colours add something new and\ninteresting to the iPhone and the\nvery fragile glass construction that\nwere used in previous constructions.\nHowever the \u201cpurpose\u201d of this phone\nis what has me so annoyed. Basically\nthis is Apple\u2019s attempt at a phone\nthat everyone could a\ufb00ord. However\ncontradictory to hopeful reports that\nthis may really be something truly\na\ufb00ordable, Apple decides to slap\nanother hundred dollars on the price.\n\u00a3469 for the 16GB and \u00a3549 for the\n32GB. You are really telling me this\nis your cheap phone? C\u2019mon people,\nthink realistically here. You can get a\ngreat phone in the Nexus 4 for half\nthat. Apple has decided that since they\nhave the fruity logo that they stick on\nthe back of the polycarbonate body,\nthat they can overcharge everyone. I\nmean why even do a cheap phone if\nall you are going to do is really make\nit unaccessible for those who really\nlooking forward to it. Either do it\nright, or don\u2019t do it at all. he sad\nthing is, probably a ton of people are\ngoing to buy it anyway.\nNow about the iPhone 5S. It actually\nlooks like a really good phone. he\nspecs are up there with the top\nphones. he 64 bit processor seems\nlike a really good new addition, and I\nreally would like to see how graphics\nintensive software runs, especially\nwith the next generation of games.\nhe \ufb01ngerprint sensor also looks like\na handy feature, and one of the only\nthings I got excited about. However\nthese two things really are the only\nstandout features of this phone.\nEverything else is just catching up\nwith the competition. When looking\nat this phone, all that was going\nthrough my mind was: \u201cYeah, well this\nis nice, but it would have been really\ninnovative and amazing if this would\nhave been the iPhone 5. And you know\nwhat the really sad thing is? It would\nhave even been possible.\u201d At least it\nisn\u2019t as much of a disappointment as\nthe 5C, and I can see it being quite\nsuccessful. However, what\u2019s up with\nthe \u201cChampagne\u201d colour? It just looks\ncheap bling. What happened with the\nunderstated beauty that Apple used\nto perfect?\nGenerally looking at the keynote itself\nyou can also see how precarious their\nposition\nhere used to be a time, were Apple\nstood impervious, invincible to\ndoubts or pressure from investors/\ncompetitors. he only time other\ncompanies or products were\nmentioned was in graphs or tables,\nillustrating Apple\u2019s dominance.\nHowever now snide comments and\njokes are needed for the Cupertino\ncompany to feel like the top dog.\nSounds like a schoolyard bully doesn\u2019t\nit?\nFurthermore, to gauge the hype\nand excitement surrounding this\nkeynote, all you had to do was look\nat the crowd, and compare it to the\nreactions of previous keynote crowds\nto tell that something has changed for\nthe computing giant. Laughing was\nrare, and cheering was even rarer and\nthat was because to be honest, there\nwas nothing to cheer about!\nAll in all its another disappointment\nfor me. I have been a loyal Apple user.\nI have bought several iPhones, own a\nmacbook, the whole shebang. I used\nthese, because the products you used\nactually were the bees knees, there\nwere things on these devices that\nother companies either didn\u2019t have or\nripped o\ufb00 from Apple. Now I watch\nin dismay as Apple falls further and\nfurther behind in anything remotely\nAre we seeing Apple crumble?\nThe News Bubble\nMaximilian Eggl\nYong Wen Chua\nTechnology Editors\nProbably the tightest partnership in the smartphone market today,\nNokia and Microsoft have gone even further by the latter buying the\nsmartphone part of the former. he Redmond based company hopes\nthat this acquisition will help the windows 8 phone compete against\niOS and Android with a tighter integration of software and hardware.\nEx-Felix Technology editor, Jason Parmar, who now works at\nMicrosoft (who predicted a similar outcome with his article on\nNokiaSoft in 2011) declined to comment on the tech giant\u2019s latest buy.\noriginal. iOS 7 was a step in a good\ndirection, but that\u2019s only a part of the\nexperience. I am so tired of looking\nat my iPhone and thinking how\nmany things would make this thing\nbetter. he thing I have learnt from\nthis, something I guess I should have\nunderstood a while ago is; empires\nnever last forever, even ones that seem\nso inexplicable great like Apple. Soon\nsomething else will come to push\nthis faltering giant of his throne, be it\nsooner or later.\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up\nto date with the newest, wierdest and most futuristic things\naround.\nNokiaSoft - MS buys part of Nokia\nSamsung watching the time?\nhe Korean heavyweight has released a new accessory to complement\nits existing devices. Featuring a 1.6\u201d LED screen which can play apps,\nmessages etc., this smartwatch sees Samsung jump ahead of Apple\nthe wearable tech world. However its low battery life and inability to\npair with non Galaxy devices, make this device a bit of a hassle to use.\nI wish it had, but among many things, brightening my day was not among them\n\n"

    "content": "27\nFRIDAY 28 SEPT\nFRESHERS\u2019 PULLOUT\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nLOCAL TRAVEL\nW\nalking around\nis a great way\nto get to know\nthe local area\nas well as\nnearby parts of London. You often\n\ufb01nd the best places to go while\nwondering around or walking to\nanother engagement. Great places\nto walk to near South Kensington\ninclude Hyde Park (obviously),\nFulham Road & Kings Road,\nKnightsbridge (and Harrods),\nBayswater and Osford Street. If\nyou do wander down to Kings\nRoad you\u2019ll \ufb01nd youself minutes\naway from the hames and aross\nthe river from Battersea and the\nbeautiful Battersea Park.\nOn the other hand walking is\nmuch slower than taking other\nmethods of transport (unless you\u2019re\non a bus during rush hour hut it\u2019s\nhealthy and refreshing!\nB\nuses! Hmm, a tricky\none! Buses can be\ngreat to get around in,\nproviding the speed of\na motor vehicle while\nstill giving you a chance to absorb\nyour surroundings. Even if you\u2019re a\nnative Londoner, you\u2019ll still have a\nlot of new things to discover, after\nall it\u2019s a big city! Buses do however\nhave downsides, they can be caught\nin heavy tra\ufb03c during peak periods\nand the seats can be hellish to sit in\nif you\u2019re above average height. Let\u2019s\nnot get onto the subject of how\ncavalier some bus drivers are when\nnavigating the roads.\nhe South Kensington campus\nhas fantastic links to the rest of\nLondon via buses, you can even get\nto Heathrow on a night bus! Buses\n9 and 10 go west to Hammersmith\nand east to Trafalgar Square and\nOxford street while other buses can\ntake you to places far and wide.\nT\nhe Tube is London\u2019s\nunderground transport\nservice, a bit like having\ntrains underground that\ncome every 2-4 minutes\n(amazing I know!), can often be\npacked full of people during peak\ntimes (I hope you don\u2019t mind\nstanding in awkward positions)\nand have a fewer number of chairs\n(bummer). However the Tube is an\nawesome way to get to places in a\nshort amount of time; travelling\nfrom South Kensington you can get\nto Charing Cross (Embankment)\nwithin 15 minutes, Hammersmith\nin 10 minutes, Heathrow in\n30ish minutes and Kings Cross\nStation similarly in 30 minutes.\nhe Tube does stop running soon\nafter midnight (or 1 AM on some\nnights) so it\u2019s not as helpful to get\nback from a night out, so if you\u2019re\nplanning a late night excursion\nyou\u2019ll probably want to check how\nto get back by bus.\nL\nondon is very well serviced\nby trains. As well as\ngetting trains to other\nparts of London there are\nalso several stations that\nhost trains travelling across the\ncountry, such as London Euston,\nLondon Charing Cross, London\nMarylebone and London Liverpool\nStreet. You can even get a train to\nScotland if you\u2019re willing to spend 5\nhours on a train. here\u2019s not much\nmore to say about train travel, we\u2019ve\nall been on trains and know how to\nuse them so here\u2019s a picture of a cat.\nC\nycling in London can\nbe a fun or dangerous\nand deadly. Many\npeople cycle to college\nfrom where they live\nand make the journey in one piece.\nHowever if you\u2019re not used to big\ncity tra\ufb03c maybe take it easy at \ufb01rst,\nmotorists can be rude, ignorant\nand just plain stupid at times. If a\ntaxi doens\u2019t want to stop to let you\ncross Prince Consort Road to get\nto the Union, do you really think\nthey\u2019ll be any better when you\u2019re on\na bicycle?\nOn the positive side, cycling at\nnight is really cool, the roads are\nmostly empty and you can cycle in\nfanatstic locations. Hyde Park is an\namazing place to cycle when it\u2019s not\nduring rush hour if you\u2019re planning\na leisure trip but you can also cycle\nacross it to make quick trips to\nPaddington or Oxford Street. And\nthere\u2019s always \u201cBoris Bikes\u201d.\nTravel Savings\n#1 Oyster Card\nhis is a key item, buy one as soon\nas you can! It\u2019s not really a saving\nbecuase it\u2019s the default travel tool\nfor the majority of Londoners but if\nyou don\u2019t have an oyster card then\nbus and train prices are much more\nexpensive.\nOyster cards have a pay-as-you-go feature that allows you\nto buy travel credit as well as\nlonger duration travel passes (or\n\u201ctravelcards\u201d) which are valid for\na week, a month or longer. If you\nplan to buy week or month long\ntravelcards, applying for a \u00a310\n18+ Oyster card will allow you to\nget savings of 30% on your week\u2019s\ntravel. Oyster cards are valid on\nbuses, trains, tubes, the DLR and\neven the River service, but can only\nbe used in London.\n#2 16-25 Railcard\nYou should already read about\nthis in the Business section, if you\nhaven\u2019t then tut, tut! he 16-25\nrailcard is the ultimate in discount\nrail travel, saving you 1/3 from any\ntrain fare as long as you travel after\n10:30 (you might want to check\nthat). For \u00a330 a year you can take\nadvantage of these reduced fares\nby travelling around England\nand visiting new places. he card\nalso works in London so if you\u2019re\nstaying with your parents make\nsure you pick one up sharpish!\nAnother awesome feature you\nmight want to know about, you can\nlink your railcard to the oyster card\nwe mentioned earlier in order to\nhave one card to save them all! his\napplies the saving to all Tube and\ntrain journeys across London.\nBarclays Bikes\nYou can buy a key or hire a bike with you r credit/debit card from the stand.\nI\nf you want to cycle as commuter\nto College or plan to cycle on the\nroads, it\u2019s probably best to get a\n\u201creal\u201d bicycle, and don\u2019t worry Felix\nwill let you know when this term\u2019s\ncampus bicycle auction takes place\n(oh, and if you ever abandon your\nbike around College, you might\n\ufb01nd it here a few months later).\nHowever if you\u2019re more of a\ncasual cyclist then maybe give\nthe Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme a\ngo. A\ufb00ectionally known as \u201cBoris\nBikes\u201d in tribute to the Mayor of\nLondon the cycle hire scheme let\u2019s\nyou hire a bike for a short period\nof time. here are lots of docks\nin Central London and the local\narea and if you didn\u2019t already\nknow they\u2019re represented by\nthe red circles on our map! he\nscheme seems daunting but it can\nbe really fun. My best experience of\nthe scheme has been cycling past\nBuckingham Palace at 1AM!\n\n"

Even if you don\u2019t feel like using\nscience chat up lines (that helicase one\nis a winner, by the way) you may still\nlearn some hints and tips to get you\nthrough this undoubtedly messy week.\nAlcohol \u2013 possibly the\nonly friend you may make\nthis week\nEthanol, that cheeky little two carbon compound, is what gives pints a\npunch- after being absorbed into the\nbloodstream it is transported to the\nliver, and then broken down by two\nsets of enzymes. It is \ufb01rst converted\ninto acetaldehyde by one enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, and then into\nacetate by another, aldehyde dehydro-genase. When these are imbalanced,\nand aldehyde dehydrogenase is less\ne\ufb03cient, acetaldehyde builds up and\ndelivers the Asian Flush some of you\nmight experience this week.\nEthanol is metabolised at a rate of\naround one regular drink every ninety minutes, so if you succumb to the\nusual calls of \u201cDown it Fresher!\u201d too\nregularly, your blood alcohol level will\nrise, and it will eventually e\ufb00ect your\nbrain. With ethanol being a depres-sant, meaning it enhances the e\ufb00ects\nof the inhibitory neurons whilst weakening the excitatory neurons in your\nbrain, it will at \ufb01rst make you relaxed,\nthen tired, then eventually will make\nyou pass out.\nPlease refrain from writing on your\nfriend\u2019s face if this happens, or at\nleast do it once you have put them to\nbed. No doubt one day (possibly even\nWednesday this week) it will be you in\nthe same position!\nHangovers \u2013 no pain, no\ngain, right?\nScience is still uncertain about what\na hangover actually is- the best guess\nis that it is a collection of symptoms\nwhich manifest due to the multiple\nphysiological e\ufb00ects from drinking al-cohol.\nWith alcohol being a diuretic it naturally increases urinary output leading\nto dehydration, causing thirst and dizziness in the morning. It is an irritant\nand can also stimulate a higher rate of\nproduction of gastric secretions, with\nboth resulting in nausea and the possibility of vomiting. Finally it can cause\nvasodilatation of blood vessels in the\nbrain, making the brain press against\nthe skull and delivering that characteristic hangover headache.\nIf you are smart enough to take painkillers before the onset of the hango-ver, only take aspirin as paracetamol is\nmetabolised by the liver too, which is\nunder enough strain as it is.\nFresher\u02bcs Flu \u2013 when the\ncough syrup replaces the\nJ\u00e4gerbombs\nhis blanket term is generally used\nto cover the run-down feeling that\ncomes from not sleeping enough, not\neating properly or drinking more than\nyou probably can handle, but can be\ncaused by infections too.\nUsually this \u201c\ufb02u\u201d is actually a manifestation of the common cold. With\nthere being 200 di\ufb00erent types of viruses that can cause a cold, and factoring in the many di\ufb00erent nationalities you will probably bump into\naround campus, it is inevitable you\nwill encounter a strain you are not already immune to.\nCombined with exhaustion, poor\nnutrition and excessive drinking,\nyour already weakened immune system doesn\u2019t stand a chance this week\nif that sni\ufb04ing guy in your intro lecture sneezes in your direction. he\nbeginning of the new academic year\nalso coincides with the beginning of\n\ufb02u season too, so even if you manage\nto avoid human contact for the whole\nweek (and I know full well some of\nyou will) you still may \ufb01nd yourself\nsneezing by Sunday.\nFreaking out about Fresher\u2019s \ufb02u?\nArm yourself with hand sanitizer, a\npacket of tissues (infused with that\nnice Aloe Vera to keep your nose\nfrom going all scaly) and a properly\ncooked meal every now and then. If\nyou still don\u2019t manage to escape it,\nyou will feel right as rain by November. Promise.\nSo, with your snakebite in one hand,\nyour hand sanitiser in another and a\nbrain full of fun fresher facts, I fail to\nsee just how you could not have a fun\ntime this Welcome Week. Relax, so-cialise, don\u2019t blow your whole student\nloan on a food shop in Harrods and\ngenerally enjoy your time as a brand\nnew student.\nLook out for us at Fresher\u2019s fair and\nwrite for Science too- we might just\naccidently tell your tutor your personal statement was all lies otherwise.\nSciencebehindFreshers\u2019Week\nSee this? This won\u02bct be you. See that guy with glasses sitting in the corner texting. Guess where this is going...\nWIRED\n\n"

Expect nights encompassing disco, house and twisted techno.\nOh, and dress to sweat.\nCoronet\nIf you like your club nights huge then the\nCoronet is a good place to start. Situated in the heart of Elephant and Castle\nthe Coronet is an ex-cinema that still has\nmany of its 1920\u2019s Art-Deco features. Due\nto its size the Coronet attracts big names;\nboth bands and DJs. Grab a bunch of\nmates, book a night and at 5am when the\nmusic stops you\u2019ll wonder where all the\ntime went.\nXOYO\nLocated just o\ufb00 the big Old Street rounda-bout, XOYO in Shoreditch is de\ufb01nitely\nworth the trip east from South Ken for a\nbig weekend night. Split over two \ufb02oors,\nthe main room is down in the basement\nwith the more chilled out second room\nand (very cramped) smoking area on the\nentrance level. Nights vary from live indie\nbands to monthly raves hosted by Bugged\nOut! and EYOE. he only downside is the\noften long queues coupled with the over\ntouchy bouncers, but once inside you\u2019re\nsure to have a good one.\nCorsica Studios\nWith the entrance through a small door\nunder the railway arches just minutes\u2019 walk\nfrom Elephant and Castle Underground\nstation, Corsica Studios is a small club\nwith a huge personality. Inside there\u2019s the\nmain bar, 2 nice size rooms with a great\nsound and a decent sized outdoor area all\ninterconnected with a maze of white brick\nwalls. he crowd is always friendly, drinks\nare reasonably priced and entrance rarely\ngoes above \u00a310, meaning if you want a big\nnight with great music without breaking\nthe bank this is the place to go.\nClubs\nCaf\u00e9 Oto\nCaf\u00e9 Oto is the jewel in the crown of\nLondon\u2019s experimental scene. Time and\nagain it has proved worth a 40 minute trip\nto Dalston. his is in no small part due to\nits civilized atmosphere, where good gig\netiquette is the rule rather than the excep-tion. More notable, though is its reputation\nfor presenting the upper crust of unknown\nartists as well as momentous collaborations and residencies from some of the\nbiggest names in free jazz and experimental music.\nBirthdays\nAlthough a bar which I\u2019ve heard has\nrecently entered the burger serving scene,\nthe basement makes for a rather ominous\ngig venue. I remember my \ufb01rst experience there; walking down into the dimly lit\nbasement to be enveloped by a pulsating\nwall of sound. In a way the venue lends\nitself to this, representing how live music\nwas meant to be: intimate, cramped,\nsweaty, intense and thoroughly enjoyable.\nUnion Chapel\nUnion Chapel is a fully operational church\nin Islington. It is a gig going experience like\nno other. Instead of a can of lukewarm Red\nStripe you can have a \ufb02apjack and choose\nfrom a selection of speciality teas. Instead\nof standing for hours waiting for the bands\nto start you sit in pews. In keeping with the\nenvironment they tend to have fairly folky\nor downbeat music and it\u2019s the perfect venue for such acts. So when your favourite\nfolk singer comes to Union Chapel, don\u2019t\nthink twice about grabbing a ticket!\nOld Blue Last\nhe Old Blue Last is the place to be seen.\nLocated in Shoreditch, this pub / live venue hosts the best in up and coming bands\nalong with some more esoteric favourites!\nhey\u2019ve played host to Arctic Monkeys,\nFoals and Hot Chip before they hit the big\ntime. You\u2019ll be able to \ufb01nd the freshest new\nacts in everything from hardcore punk\nto indie pop. here\u2019s something new and\nexciting on almost every single night. Best\nof all, the majority of gigs are free!\nRiaz\nMasson\nStocke\nmusic.felix@gmail.c\n\n"

Spotify o\ufb00ers\na music streaming service that allows\nyou to stream everything in their large\nlibrary for free during the \ufb01rst six\nmonths, after which some limitation\napplies. If you pay up \u00a310 a month, you\nget unlimited plays and you can even\nuse it on your phone. Google Music,\non the other hand, o\ufb00ers a free cloud\nstorage service for your music that\nallows you to store up to 20000 songs\non their servers to stream everywhere\nfrom your phone to your PC. If you\npay up \u00a310 a month, you get the ability\nto stream any song from their massive\nlibrary, similar to Spotify. Both\nservices o\ufb00er some sort of \u201cradio\u201d\nservice that plays songs based on\nyour listening habits. In this editor\u2019s\nopinion, Google\u2019s algorithms seem\nto o\ufb00er up better recommendations.\nIf streaming isn\u2019t your kind of thing\nand you prefer to \u201cown\u201d the music you\nbuy, Amazon and the iTunes store\nallow you to buy digital music from\ntheir stores. Amazon MP3 even has a\n\u201ccloudplayer\u201dthatallowsaccesstoyour\nsongs from anywhere. You might also\nwant to know that Amazon now o\ufb00ers\na free MP3 version of the CDs you buy\nfrom them through the new \u201cAutorip\u201d\nservice. This o\ufb00er even extends to CDs\nyou bought from them in the past.\nThere are several services out\nthere that will greatly simplify your\nlife at Imperial, especially when you\nneed to work with others. Google\nDrive is a very good tool to allow\ncollaborative editing of documents,\nspreadsheets, and even presentations.\nIf you are looking to \u201cwow\u201d people\nwith your presentation, try out \u201cPrezi\u201d.\nFancy not chugging around a\nportable hard disk with all your \ufb01les?\nIf so, you really need to try out the\nvarious cloud storage services. Google\nDrive, Dropbox, iCloud and Skydrive\nare just some of the most popular ones\non the internet right now. Use them --you won\u2019t have to panic if you forgot\nto bring your USB drive to college.\nApps\nApps are the heart of every\nsmartphone and, and a good set will\nmake your life much easier. Some\nusability and productivity apps I use\non a regular basis are the Barclays\nmobile banking account (which has\nequivalents for the other banks, is\nvery useful in checking my balance\nand doubles as a PINsentry),\nBuschecker (or any other highly rated\nbus time app, which is very useful\nfor getting around after a night out)\nand iFormulas (iOS) (which helps me\nremember those pesky formulas that\nhaven\u2019t been ingrained in my head).\nLastly, while not intrinsically useful,\nthe imperial mobile app should be\non every imperial students phone,\nwhich have reasonable prices for their\nsubscription. You could also subscribe\nto various cable services such as\nSky TV and Virgin Media some of\nwhich o\ufb00er student rates. (You would\nalso have to pay for a TV License,\nwhich o\ufb00ers a student discount.)\nOtherwise, you could always\nstream TV shows for free from BBC\niPlayer, iTV Player, or Channel 4 on\nDemand so long as they are not \u201clive\u201d.\nIf you are luck enough to have\nparents who suscribe to sky make\nsure that you install sky go on your\ndevices, use it on your PC. As long as\nyou haven\u2019t reached your device limit\n, you should be able to get free sports!\nApps\nApps can be very useful in terms\nof productivity, however they can\nalso add that extra element of\nentertainment that your gadget may\nbe lacking. The FML app, is a good\nport of call for a quick laugh, and cut\nthe rope is a very good game to have\neven if it is not free.

    "content": "45\nFRIDAY 28 SEPT\nCLUBS & SOCS\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nRobert Wright reports back from their latest contstruction project\nT\nhis summer, the annual\nEl Salvador Project saw\na team of 10 Imperial\nCollege students once again\nembark on a journey to\nCentral America. heir mission this\ntime was to upgrade a set of houses\nconstructed in 2008 that, following a\nstructural analysis by the engineering\nconsultancy ARUP, were deemed to\nbe dangerously unstable under certain\nseismic conditions. El Salvador being\na seismically active part of the world\nmeant that a retro\ufb01t was in order.\nhe retro\ufb01t was initially trialled in\n2011 in a small village in El Salvador\nknown as Costa Rica (confusing, we\nknow). Here, a total of 28 of these\nhouses were retro\ufb01tted. As part of this\nyear\u2019s project, the team visited Costa\nRica in order to check whether there\nhad been any earthquakes and more\nimportantly the condition of the retro\ufb01tted houses. hankfully all 28 houses\nwere standing despite some reported\nseismic activity, which, together with\nsome minor modi\ufb01cations, gave us the\ngreen light to continue with this year\u2019s\nretro\ufb01tting project in the much larger\ntown of San Jose Villanueva.\nSan Jose Villanueva is home to approximately 20,000 people so it naturally takes on a di\ufb00erent feel to the\nprevious village, which was mainly\njungle terrain with a very large lake.\nhe team stayed in the centre of town\nin a rented house that was equipped\nwith two rooms (an open plan kitchen and bedroom for ten), an outside\n\ufb02ushing toilet (the team were thrilled\nafter a week of the latrine in Costa\nRica), plumbing that only worked intermittently due to water shortages,\nand \ufb01nally a local shop worker Jordie\n(the other tenant and man-with-the-plan should anything in the house\nbreak). And oh did it break. Blocked\ntoilets, burst pipes, leaking roofs, this\nwas de\ufb01nitely not living the life of Riley.\nWhen we weren\u2019t battling it out with\nthe day to day di\ufb03culties of living in a\nthird world country, we were of course\nretro\ufb01tting houses. When we \ufb01rst arrived in town we had a meeting with\nthe community in order to \ufb01nd out\nwho wanted the work done and when\nwould be a convenient time for us\nto visit their home and carry out the\nwork.\nhe actual retro\ufb01t involved bracing the existing structure with timber\nbeams as shown in the picture. his\nis done by bolting the internal beams\nthrough the wall to external steel\nplates positioned at each column.\nIn addition, existing wall cracks are\n\ufb01lled with a local substance known as\n\u2018Cemento Plastico\u2019 , and the house is\npainted with waterproof paint to help\nprotect against the monsoon season.\nhe project is hands on, with the entire team practising their DIY skills\nthrough the use of power tools and a\ngood old fashioned hammer. We try\nto get the locals involved in the work\ntoo if they are willing, and this helps\nto promote information exchange and\nskills development. he o\ufb03cial language in El Salvador is Spanish and\nnaturally we had translators with us to\nhelp do all this.\nWhilst the weekdays were devoted\nto work, at weekends we went into\ntourist mode. he paci\ufb01c side of El\nSalvador is a famous surf spot and\nthe team spent some time here \u2018surfing\u2019 and chilling on the beach. Other\nweekend ventures included clubbing\nin the capital city San Salvador, tomb-stoning o\ufb00 10m tall waterfalls (there\nare taller ones though if you dare), and\na trip to ancient sites containing Mayan ruins.\nhis year\u2019s project has been a great\nexperience and we hope the work has\nbeen bene\ufb01cial. he project this year\nhas undergone a slight transformation\nwhat with a committee now in place to\noversee the running of the project and\nnew long term objectives that focus\non engineering, evaluation and educa-tion. As in previous years, we continue\nto work with the UK registered charity\nEngage for Development (founded by\nImperial College alumni) and the local NGO in El Salvador, REDES, who\nadvise and help out.\nRecruitment for summer 2014 will\nsoon be underway. Students in the\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering (where the project\nis based) will automatically receive a\nrecruitment email, but applications\nfrom students in other departments\nare also welcomed. If you\u2019d like to\njoin us, just follow us on Facebook\n(facebook.com/ElSalvadorProject) or\nTwitter (@IC_ESP) and look out for\nthe recruitment email. We\u2019re particularly interested in hearing from Spanish speakers. For information and\nenquiries, email us on elsalvad@impe-rial.ac.uk or check out our website at\nwww.elsalvadorproject.org.uk.\nThe El Salvador Project\nMy Speech, My Little story\nYi Liu reminisces about his first Toastmasters speech\nL\nadies and Gentlemen,\nImagine yourself standing\non the stage with a thousand\npairs of eyes staring blankly at\nyou, anticipating the glorious\nmoment when your mouth opens\nto push out the words that you have\nprepared for so long. Somewhere in\nyour heart, you reassure yourself again\nand again that it is all going to be okay,\nbut then what comes out is nothing\nmore than a struggling, noiseless\n\u2018pop\u2019. Does this sound familiar?\nPublic speaking is a little misleading\ndevil that haunts us in our daily lives.\nWhen we look our student presidential candidates running from lecture\ntheater to lecture theater to speak in\nfront of us before the lecture starts,\nit seems to be an easy, smooth, perhaps even enjoyable experience to\nthem. However, when these inevitable moments eventually come to you,\nit seems that even two to three audience members are enough to form a\nformidable wall in your heart. his is\nthe moment that you start to wonder,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d\nLet me share a little story. As a \ufb01rst\nyear Imperial undergraduate, I had\nthe fortune of discovering a young\nclub hidden in the Mechanical Engineering department called Imperial\nCollege Speakers. Amazingly, it is part\nof a global organization that dedicates\nitself to nurturing great speakers and\nleaders, Toastmasters International\n(a tip for the job-seeking students:\nHR departments know this organization well). I remember the \ufb01rst meeting quite vividly: the joyous, relaxed\natmosphere that illuminated the air,\nsandwiched with the slight nervousness from each member as they stood\nup on the stage and started speaking.\nYes, this is a club that asks you to make\na speech.\nI had my share of embarrassment.\nI stood in front of 20 people, legs\nslightly trembling and de\ufb01nitely feeling very anxious about my speech. So\nas I tried to make a desperate attempt\nto calm myself down, I began to shout\nin fragments: \u201cGO-OD EV-E-NING\nLA-DI-ES...\u201d. I sounded like a spoilt\nmicrophone that only makes a sound\nwhen you bang it on its corners. However, the amazing thing about Toastmaster is that immediately after the\nspeech, the audience gave me an approving glance that even I found it to\nbe unbelievable. Hey, all the members\nare just here to learn, so this is a challenge with no failure, it is just another\nexperience.\nAs I went down the journey towards\nbeing a speaker, I learn a few lessons\nand cleared a few misconceptions.\nFirst of all, speaking can be improved\nby experience. If you ever have the\nchance of audience a speech by Expresident Michelle, you will \ufb01nd her\nto be the most graceful lady on stage\n(o\ufb00-Stage too). You can\u2019t really believe\n(I still can\u2019t) that a human can be so\ncomposed on stage, even though the\nevidence is blatantly just in front of\nyou. However, behind this grace, behind the composure, behind all this\nunbelievable con\ufb01dence, is nothing\nmore than two years of public speaking experience. Trust me, if you are\nwilling to go that extra mile, eventually you will be a better speaker than\nyou ever dreamed yourself to\nbe.\nIt is through making one\nspeech after another that\nI learnt a lot about how to\ninspire people, how to be\nhumourous and how to\ncarry on a conversation.\nBut it is not\nonly about\nthe skills that\nI acquired, it is\nthe feeling of accomplishment, the\nsatisfaction that was imprinted on\nmy heart when people just cheered\nme on after a successful speech. It is\nclich\u00e9 but the truth is that every time\nmembers come to me and thank me\nfor inspiring them, I am proud of my\nspeech because it is changing people\u2019s\nlife one at a time.\nNow, it is time for me to end o\ufb00 with\na little scenario for you to consider.\nWhen we look at the professional\nspeakers standing in the limelight with\npeople cheering so loudly, there is\nidea that crosses our mind \u201cwouldn\u2019t\nit be great if one day I can speak like\nhim?\u201d(Admit it!) Well, maybe\nit is time for you to give this\nthought a little nudge.\nWho knows, maybe\ntwenty years down the\nroad, you will be thankful that little decision\nyou make here.\nTheir mums are going to be so angry at how messy their rooms are\nEl Salvador Project\n\n"

It\u2019s a \ufb01lm so powerful\nand worthy that the Cannes\u2019 Jury\nawarded the top prize not only to\nthe director (Abdellatif Kechiche),\nbut also to its two incredible stars\n(Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, L\u00e9a Seydoux).\nYou don\u2019t need a bigger stamp of\napproval than this. What\u2019s it about?\nWe follow the life of Ad\u00e8le (newcomer\nExarchopoulos), as she explores her\nsexuality and has her life turn upside\ndown when Emma (Seydoux) enters\nher life.\nMeek\u2019s Cuto\ufb00, although no-one saw\nit, was a critical hit back in 2010,\nand director Kelly Reichardt followup feature is Night Moves, leading\nthe \ufb01lms in the Debate section. Ecoterrorists Josh (Jesse Eisenberg) Dena\n(Dakota Fanning) and Harmon (Peter\nSarsgaard) execute what they believe\nto be an excellently planned act. his\nis until the media storm that sparks\nfrom their actions has unpredictable,\nunintended results. It\u2019s a slow-burning\n(much like Reichardt\u2019s other \ufb01lms), yet\ntaut political thriller that makes you\nthink and question each character\u2019s\nmotive and the blurred lines between\nright and wrong.\nBruce Dern won the Best Actor prize\nat this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival,\nin Alexander Payne\u2019s (Sideways, The\nDescendants) moving black-and-white father-son road-trip drama.\nWhen the forgetful, boozy Woody\nGrant (Dern) becomes convinced that\nhe won a million dollars and that he\nalso needs to travel to Nebraska (the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s title) from Missouri, his son\nDavid (Will Forte) reluctantly agrees.\nPayne has a knack for working his\nmagic in turning a touching narrative\ninto relatable drama minus the corny\ncheese, rather than resorting to over-the-top, sentimental melodrama.\nHe knew he was trouble when he\nwalked by\u2026but Franck (Pierre\nDeladonchamps), a handsome\nromantic enjoying his time at\nhis usual spot on a popular gay\ncruising beach in southern France,\nimmediately falls for the dangerously\nseductive Michel (Christophe Paou),\na mysterious stranger towards whom\nhe feels irresistible sexual attraction.\nhrow in a murder, and that\u2019s how\nwe get Stranger By the Lake, an eerie,\nprovocative erotic French thriller that\nembodies everything you\u2019re searching\nfor when looking at something \ufb01led\nunder \u201cDare\u201d. Like its characters\nthe \ufb01lm is full of risks and is all the\nmore shocking because of its direct,\nconfronting style.\nWith an all-star Australian cast\nincluding Aaron Pedersen, Jack\nhompson, Hugo Weaving and Ryan\nKwanten, director Ivan Sen\u2019s new\nthriller Mystery Road deals with racial\ntension and wealth gap, always a \ufb01rm\nstarting place for basing your grizzly,\ngrounded cop thriller on. Jay Swan\n(Pedersen), an Aboriginal cop, having\nreturned to his hometown after years\nof absence, is to investigate a brutal\nmurder of a teenage girl \u2013 this leads to\nnowhere pleasant, as corruption and\nconspiracy cloud the mystery even\nmore. It\u2019s a compelling, un\ufb02inching\ncop drama, which explains its place\nleading the hrill \ufb01lms of the Festival.\nVampires seem to be everywhere\nthese days but don\u2019t go in expecting\nthe norm when watching Only Lovers\nLeft Alive. Eve (Tilda Swinton) and\nAdam (Tom Hiddleston) are vampires\nreunited after some period apart.\nAll seems well, until Eve\u2019s sister Ava\n(Mia Wasikowska) turns up to spoil\nthe fun between the two. Basically,\nthe sister\u2019s acting as the third wheel,\nand no one likes that. here\u2019s a strong\ntheme of dark sensual gothic romance\nrunning through this off-beat drama,\nand the remarkably well-cast Swinton\nand Hiddleston put on impressive\nperformances.\nOther notable titles in LOVE:\nAdore, Gloria, On My Way, The Past,\nGrand Central, The Spectacular Now\nLOVE\nJOURNEY\nDEBATE\nDARE\nTHRILL\nCULT\nOther notable titles in THRILL: All is\nLost, Pioneer, Kon Tiki\nOther notable titles in CULT: Grand\nPiano, The Zero Theorem\nLAUGH\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt is just so\ntalented that he directed, wrote and\neven starred in the leading role of his\n\ufb01rst directorial feature \ufb01lm, Don Jon.\nAll Don (Gordon-Levitt) cares about\nis his body, his pad, his ride, his family,\nhis church, his boys, his girls, and his\nporn \u2013 which is \ufb01ne for him, until\nhe gets caught in a compromising\nposition by a girl who could be \u201cthe\none\u201d. he girl being played by the sassy\nand con\ufb01dent Scarlett Johansson,\nGordon-Levitt has assembled himself\nquite the cast, including Julianne\nMoore and Tony Danza, putting\ntogether a hilarious, emotional and\ncon\ufb01dent debut.\nOther notable titles in LAUGH:\nEnough Said (featuring James\nGandol\ufb01ni\u2019s last on-screen\nperformance), Drinking Buddies\nCan you handle the truth?

But\nMowry, like a wasp, can cause disproportionate trouble for his\nsize. Mowry makes criminal contacts, steals documents, and\netches extremist anti-government slogans on buildings.

Wasp thumbs the nose at censors and security-conscious states. One man wreaking havoc across a country\nappears ridiculous and the contrast between Mowry and his\nshadowy opponents, whose administration is crumbling under its\nown paranoia, is hilarious.\nhis book is fast paced. When taking breaks I had to exhale\nand wait for my pulse to stop racing before trying anything that\nrequired focus.\nFans of hard sci-\ufb01 might be disappointed. here is little very\nmodern technology and at some points it feels like Mowry could\nhave been dropped into Nazi Germany or 50s Soviet Union. here\nare typewriters. However, the alien phrases and names throughout\nmaintain the feel of the exotic. his is a book not to be missed.\nRosemary Ware\nHarry Dresden is the only Wizard in the Phonebook.

Without giving too much away they\u2019re great\nfun short reads for anyone that enjoys a little Urban Fantasy; the\nvampires are more interesting than Bu\ufb00y\u2019s let alone Twilight\u2019s\nsparkly buggers, the faeries are just hilariously conniving and\nHarry\u2019s sarcastic, Star Wars quoting, humour manages not to get\nold despite never really growing up.\nDon\u2019t go in expecting too many surprises at the structure though;\nHarry is going to get beaten up, repeatedly and increasingly\nseverely until he\u2019s an angry walking zombie (not literally, though\nthere are those too) of a man that just wants to get through the\ntrouble, rescue the girl and sleep for a few weeks. Despite this\nslightly predictable nature, the books always grab me and I \ufb01nd\nmyself sadistically wanting to watch Harry struggle through\nwith ever more ridiculous injuries and enjoying the entertaining\ncharacters that surround him. Some of these are shamelessly\nstereotypical, for instance Harry, who it turns out is not highly\nregarded in Wizarding circles \u2013 in part due to his chequered\npast \u2013 himself freely admits to being a bit old-fashioned when it\ncomes to women (but then if you\u2019re a wizard and anathema to all\nmodern technology you\u2019re allowed to be a little unenlightened on\nsome things right?). One of the main recurring characters Karrin\nMurphy is a diminutive Chicago cop with a black belt and an\nattitude. Oh, and Harry has a literal faery godmother\u2026 which as it\nturns out isn\u2019t generally a blessing.\nAnyway, I\u2019d highly recommend it as something fairly light but\nmassively engaging.\nAlex Savell\nAt \ufb01rst glance he Prestige doesn\u2019t seem like a science \ufb01ction\nstory. Indeed, most of it isn\u2019t. But the story of two stage magicians\nbattling to out do each other in a lifelong rivalry at the turn of\nthe twentieth century, as turned in to a \ufb01lm by Christopher Nolan\nin 2006, is a wonderful tale of stage magic, illusions, unreliable\nnarrators and Nikola Tesla. Tesla!\nUnlike the \ufb01lm, the novel has a section set in contemporary\nEngland, with the descendants of the two magicians meeting and\ntrying to piece together the events of a century ago. his serves as\na framing device for the story of the magicians, and also provides\na climax for the book as a whole. he magicians in question\nare Alfred Borden and Rupert Angier, and their stories are told\nthrough the notebook of the former, written many years after most\nof the events in it, and the diary of the latter, charting his life in a\nmore direct, in-the-moment way. he two accounts of their lives\nare given one after the other, making you check back to see the\n\ufb01rst\u2019s account of an incident the second describes, and wonder\nwhich version is closer to the truth. Although, of course, the lesson\nthe book tries to teach you is that neither narrator can be trusted\nfully.\nhe science \ufb01ction in the story is very muted, only appearing\nnear the end. And although it\u2019s something very far away from the\nrealm of possibility, it feels very grounded and real. Knowing the\nman Tesla was, really would it be too surprising to \ufb01nd out he\u2019d\ninvented a technology we don\u2019t even have today? hat said, the\n\ufb01nal scene of the book in the modern day does go a bit far. he\ntechnology Tesla invented is used at the end in a way that makes\nlittle sense in the context of the world previously established. And\nwhilst it does lead to a chilling \ufb01nal image, it is rather silly.\nOverall though, a good read. he style is very believable \u2013 the\nauthor has put thought in to how a notebook and a diary of those\nsorts would read. Anyone who enjoyed the \ufb01lm will love the book,\nand at a light 350 (or so) pages, it\u2019s perfect for devouring in a\ncouple of afternoons.\nTom Rivlin\n\n"

Similar molecules can be used\nas transistors to detect circularly-polarised light.\nCircular polarisation is the basis of 3D cinema\nand television, and this discovery could lead to the\ndevelopment of lightweight, e\ufb03cient 3D displays, such\nas for mobile devices. he use of circularly-polarised\nlight in \ufb01bre optic cables could double their capacity for\ncarryingdataandsuchlightcouldbeusedfortransferring\ndata in next-generation quantum computers.\nBird brains similar to mammal brains\nComputational neuroscientist Professor Murray\nShanahanhasdevelopedthe\ufb01rstevermapofabird\u2019sbrain,\nandcomparedittothoseofhumansandothermammals.\nSeveral bird species (surprisingly, including pigeons)\nshow high intelligence and ability for reasoning,\nproblem solving and use of tools. From anatomical\nstudies of the pigeon brain, Professor Shanahan\u2019s\nteam build a map of the key processing areas, and\nfound that the bird hippocampus is very similar\nto the mammalian one and that the nidopallium\ncaudolaterale plays a similar role to the hippocampus\nin decision-making, despite having evolved di\ufb00erently.\nProfessor Shanahan says, \u201cBirds have been evolving\nseparately from mammals for around 300 million years,\nso it is hardly surprising that under a microscope the\nbrain of a bird looks quite di\ufb00erent from a mammal.\nYet, birds have been shown to be remarkably intelligent\nin a similar way to mammals such as humans and\nmonkeys. Our study demonstrates that by looking at\nbrains that are least like our own, yet still capable of\ngenerating intelligent behaviour, we can determine\nthe basic principles governing the way brains work.\u201d\n\u201cDo you like\nwriting about\nscience? Or\nwatching\npeople write\nabout it? Then\nsend an email\nto our editors\nat science@\nfelix.imperial.\nac.uk to get\ninvolved!\u201d\nTired or drunk? You might\nbe feeling quite creative\nFiona Hartley\nScience Editor\nImagine: it\u2019s 9am and you enter the\nlecture theatre that will be your home\nfor the next year. Maybe you went\nout to Ministry or you had a few too\nmany pints in Metric. Perhaps you just\nstayed up late getting to know new\npeople in halls or from your course.\nEither way you\u2019re knackered. Maybe\nyou\u2019re even still drunk!\nIf you\u2019re su\ufb00ering from a vague feeling of guilt because this isn\u2019t the work\nethic you should be starting with for\nyour new degree at Imperial, then fear\nnot. Being tired or drunk doesn\u2019t have\nto keep you from getting your work\ndone. Here\u2019s why.\nCreativity\nConventionally, creativity is linked\nwith great literature, art and music.\nMany historic artists and musicians\nwere known to drink We\u2019re all scientists here at Imperial, so when research suggests that being tired or\ndrunk can improve creative thinking\nyou might think, \u201cSo what?\u201d But science depends on creative thinking for\nits advancement. Creativity is coming\nup with novel ideas, and that\u2019s how\nyou solve problems.\nContrary to what your intuition\nmight suggest, research published in\nhinking and Reasoning in 2011 indicated that people are actually at their\nmost creative during what the authors\ntermed their \u2018non-optimal\u2019 time of\nday. In other words, if you\u2019re a night\nowl \u2013 which many of us are \u2013 then it\nis during the morning that you\u2019re best\nable to solve insight-based problems,\ndue to your grogginess. Similarly\nthose who consider themselves early\nbirds answer such questions more effectively in the evening.\nhe research was carried out by\nasking 428 undergrads whether they\nthought of themselves as morning or\nevening people, and then asking them\nto solve six questions, three of which\nwere insight puzzles and three of\nwhich were focused analytical prob-lems. Furthermore, the students were\ntested at di\ufb00erent times \u2013 one group\nbetween 8:30am and 9:30am, the other between 4pm and 5:30pm.\nhe students\u2019 performance on analytical tasks like long division was\nuna\ufb00ected by time of day, but if they\nwere an early bird or a night owl then\nthey were more successful at solving\nthe creative puzzles at their least optimum time. Furthermore, students\nwith no preference for the morning or\nthe evening didn\u2019t show any di\ufb00erence\nin success at solving the insight problems between each time of day.\nWhy? Well, it\u2019s your inability to concentrate and your wandering thoughts\nthat allow you to work out creative insight puzzles. Here\u2019s an example:\nA man has married 20 women in a\nsmall town. All of the women are still\nalive and none of them are divorced.\nhe man has broken no laws. Who is\nthe man?\nhe answer is a priest. Did you get\nit? Sleepy students, whose brains\naren\u2019t entirely focused on the prob-lem, consider many more associations\nbetween ideas than alert students and\nare more likely to answer this puzzle\ncorrectly. Even being bored can have\nthis e\ufb00ect.\nhis is actually very similar to what\nhappens if you\u2019re mildly intoxicated\nand presented with an insight puz-zle. In 2012 Andrew Jarosz and a team\nof researchers from the University of\nIllinois at Chicago tested the link between alcohol intoxication and crea-tivity. heir inebriated subjects performed worse than sober subjects on\nworking memory tests (like driving\na car), but solved the insight puzzles\npresented to them both more often\nand in less time than their sober coun-terparts.\nNow, this isn\u2019t encouragement for\nyou to get absolutely wasted every\nsingle night or to always stay up really late. Getting those creative juices\n\ufb02owing via tiredness won\u2019t help you\nto copy down notes or grind through\na problem sheet, although a ca\ufb00eine\nboost probably will, as it deceives\nyour brain into thinking you have\nmore energy than you really do. But\nwhat tiredness and intoxication will\nhelp you produce is a good idea for\nthe projects, presentations, designs or\nessays you\u2019ll have to do over the year.\nSo you might want to take into account whether you\u2019re an early bird or\na night owl when you\u2019ve got creative\nwork to do. And you might as well\ntry to make going out and having that\ndrink work for you in more ways than\none.\n\n"

Already a smash-hit at Toronto, Chiwetel Ejiofor\u2019s\npowerful leading performance has been praised, as well as McQueen\u2019s frequent\ncollaborator Michael Fassbender\u2019s chilling portrayal of a ruthless plantation\nowner. Get your hopes up for this one.\nAmerican Express Gala: Philomena\nDame Judi Dench once again shows o\ufb00 her never-ending acting prowess in\nStephen Frears\u2019 new witty, touching drama about the titular character (Dench)\nlooking for her long lost son she had to give up for adoption decades ago.

A \ufb01lm that \u201cbreaks your heart and\nthen repairs it\u201d, it\u2019s no wonder the Weinstein brothers snatched this up to release\nin time for the competitive Oscar race.\nAmerican Airlines Gala: Gravity\nJames Cameron was reportedly floored by the technical marvel of Alfonso\nCuaron\u2019s new space drama, so it must be good.

Scandalous back during the\ntime of traditional values, their relationship had to be a secret which is why very\nlittle is known of the actual relationship. But Fiennes bravely tackles the theme\nwith strong performances and a potent period mood to mesmerise and captivate\nthe audience.\nCentrepiece Gala: Inside Llewyn Davis\nHaving already received quite the critical acclaim at this year\u2019s Cannes Film\nFestival, the Coen brothers\u2019 new hit will be screened in London.

Cut off\nfrom the rest of the world by this\nmysterious, indestructible structure\nthat encloses their town, it\u2019s not long\nbefore civilisation starts to shows its\ncracks and disintegrate into chaos.\nAt the centre of it all is Dale \u201cBarbie\u201d Barbara (Mike Vogel), a newcomer to the town who is seen burying a body when we first meet him.\nJournalist Julia Shumway (Rachelle\nLefevre) wants to know everything\nthat\u2019s going on (kind of a must for\nsomeone in her line of business), radio station workers Dodee (Jolene\nPurdy) and Phil (Nicholas Strong)\nare trying their best to make contact\nwith the outside world, Sheriff Linda\nEsquivel (Natalie Martinez) is na\u00efve,\nMayor Big Jim Rennie (Dean Norris) steps up to the position of power,\nhis son Junior (Alexander Koch) has\nan unhealthy obsession with Angie\n(Britt Robertson) who\u2019s clearly not\nthat interested, whilst Angie\u2019s brother Joe (Colin Ford) and his friend\nNorrie (Mackenzie Lintz) start having sudden onset seizures. Weird.\nEach character seems to have a\nstory to tell, and with an explosive\npilot episode the series seems to be\noff to a flying start. But as the show\nprogresses there is a notable quality\ndrop, failing to keep up with the momentum its early episodes set, which\nestablishes a threatening, uneasy\nmood, leaving the audience hungry\nfor more of what the dome and the\ncrumbling society will have to offer.\nBut by in large the dramatic ideas\nstill keep the suspense going, although it\u2019s now time for answers.\nA modern reimagination of a much\nbeloved classic film (Psycho) is never\na good idea; but the creators have at\nleast done an admirable job of not\ncompletely demolishing the original\nmaterial with their new tv series,\nBates Motel.\nIt takes a while for everything to\nkick off and reach the more interesting part of the season\u2019s story arc.\nNorma (Vera Farmiga - deservedly\nnominated for an Emmy for her fantastically brave performance) and\nher son Norman (Freddie Highmore\n- just as good) relocate to Oregon.\nHaving bought a motel, Norma\nwishes to renovate the place, and\nstart a new chapter with her son,\nleaving their horrific past behind\nthem. Enter Dylan, Norman\u2019s half-brother, and hello trouble.\nThe most intriguing narrative\nstrand here is the two distinctly different mother-son relationships\nbetween the three characters: with\nNorman+Norma there are subtle\nhints the audience is shown that the\nattachment these two share might\nnot be entirely appropriate. With\nDylan (Max Thieriot) on the other\nhand, Norma is someone else, which\nfurther highlights the strikingly\nstrangebondFarmigaandHighmore\nso skillfully portray.\nBut it\u2019s a shame the show decides\nto leave this theme unattended for a\nlot of the season\u2019s episodes. More interested in the close-knit surrounding townspeople and what they get\nup to, the season seems to be going\nsomewhere when they introduce all\ntheseshadycharacters,butintheend\nno big climax ever quite materialises.\nIt\u2019s slow, but certainly worth it.\nThe light goes off and a body\u2019s\ndumped on the Bridge of Americas\nthat serves as a crossing between\nEl Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Chihuahua in Mexico. Immediately taking charge of the situation is Sonya\nCross (Diane Kruger), an El Paso\ndetective. But as she discovers more\ndetails surrounding the case, the\nmore complicated everything gets,\nfor which she needs the help of Marco Ruiz (Demi\u00e1n Bichir), a Mexican\ndetective.\nYou\u2019ll never guess just how much\nof a can of worms a single body can\nopen up. Buried evidence, unsolved\ncases from the past, government\nconspiracy, red herrings, a mighty\nresourceful killer etc...the show\nreaches far and for the most parts it\nabsolutelysucceedsinsellingthesto-rywithcredibility,alotofitthanksto\nits grounded leads.\nKruger\u2019s Cross is a detective with\nAsperger Syndrome, making normal\nsocial interactions difficult for her.\nShe\u2019s a stickler for rules, and has a\nclearsenseofwhat\u2019srightandwrong,\nwhat\u2019s legal and illegal. And the awkwardness she feels even with close\ncolleagues of hers is oddly touch-ing, and her frequent bursts of blunt,\nfrank truths give room for laughter.\nMismatchedbutpartneredupwith\nher anyway is Bichir\u2019s Cruz, a more\neasy-going, rule-bending man from\nacross the border - and it\u2019s this bud-dy-cop angle that works so well.\nNo character is squeaky clean, they\nall have human imperfections, and\nwhilst the long-winded investigation\nas well as the large cast take up a lot\nofepisodestofullygelasawhole,this\nisafreshtakeonabuddy-copdrama.\nBefore Hannibal (a cool and suave\nMads Mikkelsen) met Clarice, there\nwas Will Graham (a brilliantly unstable Hugh Dancy), a story previously\ncovered in The Red Dragon, but\nNBC\u2019snewdramatakesalltheblood,\ngore,andgutstoawholenewlevelof\ngraphic sadism in their remake.\nGraham has the special gift/curse\nof being able to very accurately recreate a murder scene in the point of\nview of the killer. It\u2019s his skill to em-pathise with, and truly understand\nthe nature of the vicious, dangerous\npeople out there committing heinous crimes. Having an agent like\nWill as a consultant is great news for\nJack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne)\nof the FBI when hunting down the\nmost wanted men and women, but\nevery case takes a toll on Will\u2019s own\nsanity.\nConcernedforhismentalwelfareis\nhis colleague Dr Alana Bloom (Caro-line Dhavernas) and this is where\nHannibal Lecter comes in, a brilliant\npsychiatrist asked to treat Will.

But\nwith outstanding twists, turns and\ndownright horrific images, Hannibal\nstands out from the rest, as a must-see police drama, even if you have a\nlowtolerancelevelforunpleasantim-ages. Plus as a massive bonus there\u2019s\nGillian Anderson making wonderful\nspecial guest appearances.\n\u201cHow does it feel c***s*****?\u201d says\nMickey Donovan (Jon Voight, in his\nmightiest presence with peculiar ec-centricities), as he sticks a gun into\na priest\u2019s mouth, firing it shortly af-terwards. We just saw him released\nfrom prison a minute ago, and yet it\nseems he\u2019s back to his old habits.\nSoon after there\u2019s another body.\nThis time a female. The man lying\nnext to her, a sports star now in a\nflurry of panic, dials Ray Donovan\n(an excellent, excellent Liev Schreiber). And boy did he call the right\nperson; for Ray is a professional fixer\nfor the rich and famous of sunshine\nL.A. He\u2019s the taller, bigger, more\nbrutal, white, male, cable version of\nOlivia Pope in \u201cScandal\u201d\n. By \u201ccable\u201d\nit means there\u2019s more violence, more\nsex, more drugs, more swearing.\nRay Donovan is a fascinatingly cru-el, cynical family drama that packs\nin all the familiar dark and twisted\nevents of late and creates convincing characters to play out such sce-narios. It\u2019s certainly a show that will\nmake you feel better about your own\nfamily. What Donovan and his family have to face on a daily basis ring\nshockingly true to some of the top\nheadlines today.\nWhat complicates Ray\u2019s life further\nis the unexpected early release of his\nfather Mickey, who he despises for\nreasons unknown to the audience.\nHis wife Abby (remarkably fierce\nPaula Malcomson) warms to Mickey\u2019s presence, not quite knowing the\nfull picture, since Ray\u2019s the secretive\nkind of guy who keeps everything\nlocked up.\nEvery narrative advancement is\nperfectly judged and paced, with\nrich, layered characters played by the\nfaultless cast - simply unmissable.\nJohn Park reviews a few more summer television hits\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION Editor: John Park\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n16 FRIDAY 28 SEPT\nLong live The White Queen? Not quite\nJohn Park Television Editor\nThe White Queen\nLaughed at and ridiculed for its astonishing amount of historical inac-curacies, BBC\u2019s expensive production of The White Queen, based on\na series of historical fiction novels\nwritten by Philippa Gregory came to\na close on Sunday 18th August, with\na swift cancellation notice from its\nnetwork, which isn\u2019t all that surprising since a) this cost an absolute fortune and a heck of a long time to put\ntogether, b) the ratings and reception were hardly something to boast\nabout, and c) for the most part the\nmain stories were concluded satisfy-ingly with no loose ends left behind.\nWhat once looked and sounded\nso promising at the start became\ndishevelled and downright dull in\nthe period of ten weeks. There is so\nmuch to cover it seems, in this 10-part mini-series that the show often\nfinds itself warping through time,\nonly keeping the audience in check\nwith time-stamps at the bottom of\nthe screen. It powers through the\nsignificant historical events, ticking\naway at the boxes\nThe Lancaster and York families are at war for the control of the\nEnglish throne. When the mad King\nHenryVIoftheLancasterfamilyfalls\nand Edward IV (Max \u201cson of Jeremy\u201d\nIrons) of York takes over the throne,\nit\u2019s more challenging than ever to\nhave absolute power over the coun-try. There are hidden plots at every\ncorner, and in the day and age where\nyourownfamilymemberiswillingto\nbetray you for more money and au-thority, it\u2019s clear that you can trust no\none. Thus putting matters into further turmoil is the fact that Edward\nIV has not one, but two brothers:\nGeorge (David Oakes) and Richard\n(Aneurin Barnard), both with goals\nand ambition of their own, which is\nneveragoodsignwhentryingtorule\na peaceful kingdom.\nKing Edward IV\u2019s impulsive marriage to Elizabeth Woodville (Rebec-caFerguson,quitetherisingstar),lat-er dubbed The White Queen (their\ncourtship starts with attempted rape\nand later ends up as true love), is not\na popular one. They\u2019re from opposing families, plus there\u2019s a rumour\ngoing around that Elizabeth and her\nmotherJacquetta(JanetMcTeer)fre-quently practice witchcraft.\nThe sudden rise in ranks of ElizabethWoodvilleisnottakenlightlyby\nRichard Neville the Earl of Warwick\n(James Frain), known as the Kingmaker, for his instrumental role in\nhelpingEdwardIVsecurethecrown.\nBetrayalssoonfollow,andalsotossed\ninto this deadly ring of scheming and\ntreachery are his two young daugh-ters, Isabel (Eleanor Tomlinson) and\nAnne Neville (Faye Marsay) who are\nbound to be pawns in their father\u2019s\nviciuos games.\nBut wait, that\u2019s not all (still with me\nso far?). Praying and praying for her\nson\u2019s rightful claim to the throne is\nMargaret Beaufort (Amanda Hale),\nmother of Henry Tudor, a Godfearing, devout Catholic lady who is\nsingle-handedly trying to orchestrate\nher son\u2019s victory. Further messing\nwith your head is the addition of another Margaret, this time Margaret\nof Anjou (Veerle Baetens), the wife\nof mad King Henry VI (remember\nhim?), now exiled to France, quietly\nplotting a comeback with her young\nson.\nEven all that, doesn\u2019t begin to cover\nall the characters who eventually enter the picture for the many, many\nconflicts that ensue. Whereas Game\nof Thrones had a way of making everyone stick to our mind, The White\nQueen, despite some good performances in the ensemble doesn\u2019t\nquite succeed. Everything moves at\nsuch an awkward pace, sometimes\nploddingly, sometimes alarmingly\nquickly, that it\u2019s difficult to have a\nfirm grasp on who\u2019s who until at least\nquite a few episodes into the series.\nIt\u2019s no doubt intriguing, once you\ncan take the time to wrap your head\naround the setting and find yourself\ndeeply rooting for whichever character for whatever reason. It might be\nwise to brush up on your knowledge\non the War of the Roses to prevent\ngetting completely lost in this dense,\nmultiple story-arc costume drama.\nStaying faithful to Gregory\u2019s books,\na lot of the action takes place off the\nscreen,sodon\u2019tgointothisexpecting\nsome grand battles or big sieges, because where the action lies is in conversations and plotting that happens\nbehind closed doors, inside cham-bers, dark alleys and forests.\nAnd with every episode richly\npacked with facts and events, it is\nclearly a historical drama wanting\nto be taken seriously: a task compromised due to its many startling and\nquite frankly, embarrassing errors\nand goofs. Zippers on clothes and\nplastic clips may be easy to overlook,\nbut concrete steps and shiny metallic\npoles are not. Looking squeaky clean\nat every turn, the series\u2019 general atmosphere fails to really capture the\nlook and ambiance of the era, and\nthe sugar-coated, tidied up production doesn\u2019t resonate.\nBut despite the errors, this blood-less, sexless (a lot of the violent, racy\nscenes were edited out for English\naudiences since, you know, we\u2019re all\nprudes) show marches on, aware of\nthefactthatithasplentyofstoriesleft\nto tell. And the actors all do a decent\njob, although the best ones (McTeer\nand Frain especially) are sadly short-lived and don\u2019t last throughout the\nseries.\nThe series finds itself a neat point\nto finish off on, and although there\nare plenty more events that the show\ncould have focused on had there\nbeen a renewal, BBC made the wise\ndecision to put this costly, confused\nshow out of its misery.\nThe White Queen is out on DVD\n\n"

However early reception\nfrom the festival circuit has been\nmixed - with far too many characters\ntaking up room, not allowing each\nindividual \u201cvantage point\u201d to breathe\nand have a sustainable plot-line of its\nown.

    "content": "GAMES\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\nImran Rashid\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n40 FRIDAY 28 SEPT\nBroke and Bored?\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames Editor\nAhead of you, dear reader, be you\nfresher or a returning student, is\na substantial (or perhaps not so\nsubstantial) amount of work. To\nprovide some relief from the never\nending coursework and lab reports,\nthis article will try to introduce you\nto some games that will serve you\nwell this year, without breaking the\nbank. hese games, while not the\nnewest you will ever see, have a lot\nof replay value and are easily worth\ntheir money. In fact, comparing\nthem to some of the new stu\ufb00 out\nthere, I would take these any day. I\ntry to split these beauties into their\ndi\ufb00erent genres, so that you get a\nquick overview of the games on hand.\nGame: Minecraft\nPrice: 20\u20ac on the website (for PC/\nMac version)\nPlatform: PC, Mac, Xbox 360, iOS\nand Android\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Minecraft,\nthen you should get out from under\nthat rock you have been living\nunder. It has been the sensation of\nthe indie gaming world, propelling\nits creator Magnus (Notch) Persson\nto game-creator stardom. In fact it\nhas been so successful that several\ncharacters and features of the\ngame have entered popular culture.\nhe idea behind this game, is that you\nare a blockheaded character, who is\nstranded in a cube world and must\nsurvive in any way. Simple, right?\nAnd that is the greatest feature of this\nGame:\nCounterStrike\nSource/Global\nOffensive\nPrice: \u00a313.99/\u00a311.99 on steam\nPlatform: PC and Mac\ngame, it is easy to play and you can\nplay anyway you want. If you want to\nbe a rugged explorer, a creative artist\nor an ingenious redstone (electricity\nequivalent) engineer this game allows\nyou to do exactly that. his freedom\nand lack of pressure is liberating, and is\nagreatwaytowinddownafteranexam\n(or even before if you feel foolhardy).\nA great thing about this game is the\nfact that you get free updates pretty\nmuch from the point you bought it,\nwhich means every so often something\nnew will come in that will change\nyour game experience. Furthermore\nthe modding society is very active as\nwell, meaning if you do ever get bored\nthere are tons of things to look for!\nhis game is for all those casual\ngamers looking for a game that won\u2019t\nbreak the bank and that is relatively\neasy in terms of learning curve, yet\nvery engrossing. Even for all you\nIt is hard to believe that this game\nstarted out as a mod of half life. It\nwas so successful as a mod, that it\nmade it into its own game. his is\npretty much the big daddy of all\nmodern FPSs and really should not\nbe missed out if you are a fan of that\ngenre. With Valve\u2019s Source engine,\nthese two versions are really top\nnotch games that can perform at\ncomfortable levels for most PCs.\nhere is no story or anything of the\nsort. he only thing you do is sign\non to various servers (community or\no\ufb03cial) that have di\ufb00erent types of\ngame modes. It varies from the casual\ngun game, to the very competitive\no\ufb03cial hostage/defuse missions. hen\nyouplayroundsbasedonthosemodes.\nhis way of playing is very e\ufb00ective\nand entertaining, as you don\u2019t really\nneed to invest a lot of time for a lot\nof fun. At the start you may have to\nlearn the ways of the game, but after\nthat its all very well balanced. he\nfact that you can drop in and out\nof servers, as well as the fact that\neach round on average lasts about 5\nminutes max, means that this game\ncan be used perfectly for that short\nstudy break that you a\ufb00ord yourself.\nOne of the reasons that this game\nwill rack up the hours is the input of\nthe community, which is very vibrant\nin both GO (Global O\ufb00ensive) and\nSource, and has lead to multiple\nmodi\ufb01cations of the standard\nCounter-terrorist versus terrorist\ndefault modes. You can go from the\nmost casual sniper deathmatches, to\nvery intense zombie maps very easily.\nGetting one of these games is the\neasy choice, the hard part is deciding\nwhich one. Source has a bigger\ncommunity, as well as having bigger\nvariations on the defaults modes, and\nseems less buggy. Global O\ufb00ensive\n(cheaper one) is newer, has better\ngraphics, and handy o\ufb03cial servers\nas well as the community ones. Also\nthe learning curve is a bit gentler for\nthe initiate. However in the end it\ndoesn\u2019t really matter which one you\nget, you will pour a ton of time into it.\nGame:\nMount and Blade:\nWarband\nPrice: \u00a314.99 on steam\nPlatform: PC\nOf all the games I have talked about,\nthis one here is my favourite and\npossiblytheonethatmostpeoplewon\u2019t\nknow, which is quite a shame. Made\nby the turkish studio TaleWorlds, this\nindie game perfectly captures that\nadventure feeling. Basically you are an\nadventurer dumped in the medieval\nlands of Calradia, and you can do what\nyou like. Want to go and marry one of\nthe local beauties? Go ahead. Want\nhardcore battle\ufb01eld and COD players\n- try it, you may actually like it!\nGunning for a game? Have a look at these Crafty reviews which will\nLook at my horse, my horse is amazing!\n\n"

SFE\no\ufb00ers student loans and\ngrants which help cover university\nfees and living costs. Imperial\nCollege London also o\ufb00ers bursaries/\nscholarships which can be applied for.\nWhy open a student\naccount?\nWith the start of university, the most\nimportant preparation you should be\ndoing is to \u2018Sort out your \ufb01nances\u2019.\nhe \ufb01rst step to achieve this is to\nopen a student account at the right\nbank. here are many banks out there,\neach and every one of them o\ufb00ering\na variety of di\ufb00erent services and\nfreebies. he most important thing\nyou should be considering is cost-free\nborrowing (interest free overdraft).\nhis is the crucial di\ufb00erence between\nstudent accounts and standard\naccounts. Student accounts also o\ufb00er\nthe same functions such as internet/\nmobile banking, direct debit facilities,\ncontactless etc. hese accounts are\ndesigned for people who are attending\nhigher education, so open your\naccount now!\nInterest Free Overdraft:\nhis is the most important factor\nyou should be considering, as you\nmay be feeling \ufb01nancial constraints\nlater on in the year. he larger the\nInterest Free Overdraft the better, as\nsome banks could charge you more\nto increase your borrowing. Many\nstudents also use overdraft to add\nfunds to an ISA, this is a savings\naccount with a favourable tax status,\nthereby earning you interest on free\nborrowed money. Currently the\nbanks which o\ufb00er the best interest\nfree overdrafts with up to \u00a33000\nare HSBC and Halifax. Beware that\nborrowing past the free overdraft\nlimit will incur you heavy charges,\nalong with interest rates of up to 24%\nAER.\nBranches situated near\ncampus:\nHaving a bank branch near campus\nis very important for any problems\nwith your account, or lost cards after\na wild night out. here is a Santander\nbranch on campus, with Barclays,\nRBS, HSBC, Llodys TSB and Natwest\nwithin the South Kensington area.\n16 \u2013 25 Student Railcard\nhis o\ufb00er entitles you to a student 16-25 railcard available for up to 4 years,\nwhich o\ufb00ers 1/3 o\ufb00 rail fares. hese\ncards normally cost \u00a330 per year, but\nsome banks give this for free when you\nopen a student account. his is useful\nfor example when taking weekend\ntrips away to Brighton Pleasure\nBeach or when visiting friends in\nManchester (\u00a376.30 without railcard;\n\u00a351 with railcard). hese railcards\ncan also be added to your oyster\ncards to give a 34% discount of tube\nfares (o\ufb00-peak) and 34% o\ufb00 the daily\ncap. his card is an amazing deal and\nI would recommend you purchase\none if the bank you choose does not\no\ufb00er it for free.\nTaste Card\nNo doubt after coming to London\nas a student you will be doing a lot\nof cooking as a \ufb01rst year student.\nHowever for those of you who are\nlooking to try the various di\ufb00erent\nchain restaurants and cuisines in\nLondon, some banks o\ufb00er a free taste\ncard for every year of study when\nyou set up an account with them.\nhis card worth \u00a380 is o\ufb00ered by\nNatwest and RBS, and o\ufb00ers 50% o\ufb00\nor 2 for 1 deals at thousands of UK\nrestaurants (e.g GBK, Pizza Express,\nZizzi Restaurant). I personally have\nnever had a taste card, but in case you\nwant to try it out, they are currently\no\ufb00ering a 30 day free trial card.\nHeadline Interest Rate\nhis is the highest interest rate\n(gross/AER) paid on balances held\nin the accounts. Most of the student\naccounts o\ufb00er 0% headline interest,\nhowever some banks do o\ufb00er it,\nsuch as HSBC (2%), Halifax (0.1%),\nSantander (1%) and Bank of Ireland\n(0.5%). My recommendation is that\nif you do have spare cash in your\naccount, transfer it to a high interest\nsavings account.\nOther\nHSBC has teamed up with Sony\nto o\ufb00er up to 18 music albums to\ndownload for free.\nLLodys TSB o\ufb00ers free NUS Card\nand \u00a375 o\ufb00 a holiday booked through\nSTA travel.\nWhichever bank account you choose,\n\ufb01nd one that suits YOU.

    "content": "FRESHERS\u2019 PULLOUT\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nSTUDY HABITS: A Definitive Guide\nShiladitya Ghosh talks about the techniques and myths of studying\nY\nou\u2019re freshmen now.\nNo more school for you\n\u2013 all grown up! (Yeah,\nright. Still a teenager,\naren\u2019t you?)\nEver since you got your school-leaving grades and (congratulations!)\nyour Unconditionals, all everyone\u2019s\nbeen talking to you about is how to\nprepare for the \u201cbig jump\u201d from school\nto University: what laptop/tablet/\nMacbook you should buy, which self-help book (wait, no one reads books\nanymore\u2013morelikelytobeaBuzzfeed\narticle) contains the best tips you need\nfor strategically managing your time,\nhow to most e\ufb00ectively customise\nyour Spotify \u2018studying\u2019 playlist, which\nenergy drinks you should get used to,\nwhat are the best \u201calternative\u2019 sleeping\ncycles that might work for you, and so\non.\nHowever, all this clamouring about\ndetails doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to a\nsuccessful studying strategy \u2013 indeed,\nit can even back\ufb01re. People can work\nthemselves up and feel so daunted by\nthe seemingly-immense prospect of\ncollege studies that they unthinkingly\ngo with the \ufb02ow and throw money\naround in an attempt to embrace tips,\ntricks, and gimmicks \u2013 anything that\nthey\u2019re told will give them an edge.\nHowever, during your time here, you\nwill see that people religiously sticking\nwith these techniques, even when\nthey aren\u2019t working so well, will be\nkilled o\ufb00 by George R. R. Martin, start\nfalling by the wayside and struggle\nin the crunch period building up to\nSummer Finals. So, Felix shall attempt\nto disillusion you and clear up any\nmisconceptions you might have about\nthe art of studying at Imperial before\nit\u2019s too late.\nWhile studying in the College\nLibrary with your peers is known\nto have undoubted positive e\ufb00ects,\nit isn\u2019t for everyone. Furthermore,\nsitting with a latte in Starbucks with\nyour iPod and lecture notes before\nyou is inevitably going to result in\nyou fruitlessly doodling on the fruits\nof your free printing credit and\nInstaspamming people about how\nyou\u2019re getting no work done. Which\nthey knew 2 hours ago when you\nfrolicked o\ufb00.\nSo, the other option besides not\nstudying at all, is to try to study in your\nroom.\nHow to make it work:\n- Be blessed [citation needed] with a\nsingle room in Halls\n-Haveself-controlregardinginternet\nusage \u2013 including Snapchatting\n- Set a good personal deadline to\n\ufb01nish your assignment i.e. if you\nexpect to do the 3 assigned questions\nin an hour, aim to do it in 45 minutes\ninstead\n- Keep communicating with other\nstudious people working on the same\nassignment, to pace yourself/have\nsome troubleshooters handy\nHow to watch it all go up in smoke:\n- Have a roommate (they may be\nwell-meaning but they are a fount of\nopportunities for distraction)\n- Have leftover chores causing\nmental anxiety \u2013 like cooking dinner,\nor doing your laundry, oh wait you still\nhaven\u2019t cooked dinner yet, but now\nit\u2019s time to iron your clothes!! Maybe\nyou\u2019ll just copy the tutorial answers\ntomorrow morning.\n- Have a TV/gaming rig in your\nroom (\u2026just one more match on\nFIFA, I promise\u2026)\nhe average student boasts about\nhow many all-nighters s/he\u2019s pulled.\nhe better student boasts about how\nfew all-nighters s/he\u2019s pulled. While\nImperial is notorious for working you\nharder than most other places, and\npractice makes perfect, what you\u2019re\nstudying isn\u2019t rocket science (okay,\ntough luck, Aero Eng. crew), but it\ncan\u2019t be reliably mastered at 0430hrs\nafter you\u2019ve chugged 3 cans of Red\nBull just to \ufb01nish the introductory\nquestion of your project report.\nEventually you will \ufb01nd your\ntimetable to be scattered throughout\nthe day, with lectures and tutorials at\nany random time between 9am-5pm,\nand then clubs/societies meetings/\ntrainings anytime thereafter \u2013 in\nwhich case, you may not even get\nopportunities to have powernaps\nafter staying up late. And any peer\nI\u2019ve seen who\u2019s taken the gamble of\npowernapping at 11pm (to wake up at\n2am and continue working) has failed\nhilariously.\nSome of you might fancy yourselves\nto be night owls, which is great for\nyou, but unfortunately you do tend to\nhave lectures, tutorials, and exams in\nthe morning more often than not ->\nhaving sleep deprivation wouldn\u2019t be a\ngood start to the day.\nFurthermore, deliverables (that\u2019s\nwhat projects and submissions that\nare \u2018counted\u2019 tend to be called) are\ngenerally due in the evenings, so you\nmay well \ufb01nd yourself struggling\nto be productive on a sleepy Friday\nafternoon, rushing to complete and\nturn in an assignment after all your\nine\ufb03cient late nights\u2026 unless you\u2019re\nadept at being productive while the\nsun is out. Get some work done during\nthe day, folks.\nFirstly, regarding laptops: it really\ndoesn\u2019t matter if you use Windows\nor Mac. Whatever you\u2019re personally\nmore comfortable using, is the best\nbet. Period.\nSecondly, all you\u2019ll really need is\na decent computer with a decent\ninternet connection (Long Live\nImperial-WPA/LAN!) to access your\nlecture recordings (may/may not exist\nyet, depending on your department),\nBlackboard material, and lecture\nnotes/web resources.\nFancy-schmancy tablets, iPad\nMinis, Galaxy Tabs, all have the odd\ncircumstantial perk but they aren\u2019t\nnecessary in any way. Many \ufb01nancially\nless-well-o\ufb00 students do well without\nthem all around the world, and even\nif they had the money, a\ufb04uence\nwouldn\u2019t necessarily help.\nGood ol\u2019 pen(cil) and paper, coupled\nwith aforementioned computer\n(equipped with internet access) and a\nhandy printer (available in the College\nLibrary and your Department), are\nunbeatable.\nYou may have long-practised\nabsorbing academic information in\nyour headphone-generated enclave,\nbut according to recent scienti\ufb01c\nstudies, listening to music is little\ndi\ufb00erent from keeping your ears open\nto white noise in your surroundings \u2013\nin fact, the regular changes in pitch,\ntempo, timbre, voices etc. makes your\nbrain work harder to keep up with it\nall (albeit subconsciously) in addition\nto internalising the wisdom from the\ntextbook before you, thus draining you\nof energy. You\u2019re at Imperial; you\u2019d do\nwell to trust science. (Disclaimer: one\nof the studies referenced was done by\nthe University of Phoenix, so do take a\npinch of salt with this.)\nFrom personal experience though, it\ncan help to be plugged in to an aural\nlandscape while doing project work\nin the library for instance, as you\naren\u2019t distracted by friends constantly\nwalking by or chatting (because you\ncan\u2019t hear them), and when you\u2019re\ndoing project work, it\u2019s not so much\nmental acrobatics you need to do\nat this point (that should have been\ndone when you were working out how\nto even do the project) as much as\nstrategizing,formatting,summarising,\nand writing what you already know.\nAs you may have realized, all the\nabove is true to a certain extent and\napplies more to some and less to\nothers. However, it is worth being\nwell-informed about how things can\ngo wrong before you have to learn the\nhard way (by messing up your \ufb01rst\nyear grades \u2013 it ain\u2019t pretty to have to\nsee your batchmate have to leave the\ncollege so early.)\nLastly, one of the only good ways\nyou can take a break from studying,\nis by writing for Felix. Look at this\nsnazzy paper & pullout; wouldn\u2019t you\nwant your name on it too?\n#1: Studying Venue\n#2: Studying Time\n#3: Studying Gadgetry\n#4: Studying Music\nJOE LETTS\nFelix needs you!\nWant to join FELIX? Great! We need regular writers, section editors,\nphotographers, illustrators, copy editors and more! email me at\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk to get involved.\nTrying to revise for Fluid Mechanics, but hey it\u02bcll be \ufb01ne to doodle for a while right? I\u02bcm staying mentally active!\n28 FRIDAY 28 SEPT\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT Editors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n8\n\u2018The Imperial Thing\u2019: Why Comment Matters\nT\nhere are people out there\nthat are highly critical\nof the ethos of Imperial\nCollege and its approach\nto academic pursuits.\nSome individuals from outside the\ninstitution \ufb01nd it \u2018lacking\u2019 in certain\nqualities. hey often attempt to\ndraw parallels between ourselves\nand the University of Oxford or\nthe University of Cambridge. Be it\nthe lack of stunning architecture,\nthe skewed gender balance or its\nunrealised \u2018brand\u2019 they choose to\ndraw upon every negative fathomable\nand consider us gauche, unre\ufb01ned and\nimbalanced. his provides the Raison\nD\u2019\u00eatre of Felix Comment; Imperial\nCollege needs to utilise every voice\npossible in order to ward o\ufb00 and\nrise above these criticisms. Every\nvoice matters. Your voice matters.\nIn the coming academic year Felix\nComment (managed by my colleague\nTessa Davey and me) will publish a\nnumber of articles in line with the\ncontemporary developments a\ufb00ecting\ntheCollegeandindeedthewiderworld\non a weekly basis. It will be our task to\nconvey balanced credit and criticism\nin relation to any academic, sociopolitical or cultural developments\nwithin Imperial College; we cannot\ndo justice to this duty as an isolated\nentity. he newspaper is merely a\nfocus of the information relevant\nto over ten thousand students, sta\ufb00\nand academics. Felix Comment\nacts as their conduit, a platform\nupon which their opinions and\nconvictions can be revealed in the\npublic arena. Past articles submitted\nhave varied signi\ufb01cantly. Some have\nbeen casual in tone, others have\nsparked controversy but all have been\nequally valid; it is discussion and\ndebate that truly makes a university.\nWhen analysing Imperial College\nas a whole it appears to be more\nthan a school. It is a community.\nYou might care to draw parallels\nwith ancient Athenian democracy,\nwhich centred on the polis. It was\na world founded on variety and\ncontinuous evolution, where politics\nand theatre were considered equals.\nIts fuel was debate and discussion,\ncreating the cornerstones of sport,\nart, philosophy and medicine, to\nname but a few. A series of solitudes\nwere connected to create the\nrecognisable whole. It was a system\nthat ventured into new frontiers\u2026and\nyet it was more than that. To quote\nDr. Richard Miles, senior lecturer in\nClassics at the University of Sydney,\n\u2018he polis was something you\nbelonged to, the place that gave you\nan identity.\n\u2019\nhis is the chief strength of Imperial\nCollege; our thoughts, ideas and\nvoices will prove to be our enduring\nlegacy, our integral link between one\nanother. You may be an engineer, a\ngeologist or a medic but there are\nshared interests and ideals between\nus all. Any \ufb02aw in the university can\nbe overcome by interaction, which\ncan ultimately deliver progress.\nFelix Comment is just one of many\nEoghan J. Totten\nComment Editor\notten\navenues that can facilitate this.\nEach student inherits insane\nvolumesofwork(andifyou\u2019reafresher,\nbelieve me, you will) and are therefore\nsubject to common stresses and trials.\nIn many cases resentment spawns\nand it is often amassed on a Collegewide, rather than Departmental,\nbasis. A solution to a problem takes\ntime, working its way up from the\nindividual, through the Students\u2019\nUnion and into the upper echelons\nof Imperial College. his process\nof debate often needs a catalyst;\nFelix Comment has recurrently\nprovided this over the years.\nWhile students at the College\nhave common interests they are\nbalanced by a rich and dynamic\nmulticulturalism unrivalled by any\nacademic institution in the UK.\nhis, for me, epitomises the need\nfor commentary. he students and\nsta\ufb00 possess in\ufb01nitely many links to\nglobal issues and thus the need to talk\nabout them arises. Civil war, tyranny\nand poverty have often a\ufb00ected the\nfamilies of students and sta\ufb00 who\nstudy away from their homeland. he\nduty has often fallen to Felix Comment\n(and Felix as a whole) to galvanise\ncondolence, sympathy or support for\nthese people in their hour of need.\nhe previous academic year of\n2012-2013 was riddled with tragedy,\nwith the rapidly evolving Syrian\ncrisis a case in point. Such events\nserved to highlight that each and\nevery one of us has been attracted\nat Imperial College for a reason,\nunderpinned by an aspiration for self-betterment through the medium of a\ntechnical education. he buildings,\nthe people and the community are\nthe centrepiece of it all. Discussion\nin the direction of their improvement\ncannot fail be a good thing.\nFortunately Felix Comment also\ndeals with light-hearted matters.\nPrevious topics of debate have\nranged from that of climate change\nto the introduction of the \u2018Grade\nPoint Average\u2019 system. Such vast\nand extensive topics have provided\nsumptuous material for debate. he\ncomment section has repeatedly\ndemonstrated that the mechanisms\nof discussion, that vital threshing\nand contention, can provide more\nsatisfaction than the outcome itself.\nIn order to end on a positive note I\nhavecontactedanumberofindividuals\nfrom di\ufb00erent branches of life within\nImperial College, asking them to give\na brief synopsis of what has made\ntheir University opportunities truly\ngreat. hey bear witness to the many\nadvantagesawardedbyourCollegeand\ndemonstrate that we can be proud of it.\nIt is our very own polis. By\nenmeshing ourselves with its ebb\nand \ufb02ow it might just become the\nplace that forges our future identity.\nOne way of doing that is to keep in\ntouch with Felix. If you feel a need to\nvocalise any issue, no matter how big\nor small, e-mail the team at comment.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk and we will\nendeavour to help within our means.\nTo close I shall quote the\nNobel Laureate Seamus Heaney.\nBetween my finger and my thumb\nhe Squat pen rests.\nI\u2019ll dig with it.\nI\nmperial\nhas given me\nthe opportunity\nto encounter people from\na range of different and diverse\nbackgrounds, all of whom are united\nby a desire to excel\u2026The network I\nhave built will remain with me long after\ngraduation.\u201d\nAbdul, MPhil Nuclear Engineering from the\nUniversity of Cambridge and Imperial\nAlumnus\nT\nhe UROP placement has\ngiven me an insight into\nthe everyday life of an academic\nresearcher, increased my knowledge about\ntopics relevant to my degree\u2026It will be a good\nthing to have as experience when applying for\ninternships and jobs in the future.\nSimon, Materials Engineer and bene\ufb01ciary\nof the coveted UROP programme\nT\nwo years ago I did my Erasmus at Imperial and I was able to experience world-class research, meet fantastic people\nand live in one of the coolest cities in the world. And when you have the possibility to do your Ph.D. in this place, why\nwouldn\u02bct you?\nRichard, Prospective PhD student\nT\nhe opportunity to\nstudy for a year abroad\nis de\ufb01nitely something I\nwould recommend. Not\nonly do you get\nto taste a different\nenvironment, for\nacademia as well as\nfun times, but it does\nnot even delay your\ngraduation, which is\nboth rare and valuable.\nPierre, Aeronautical\nEngineering on a\nyear abroad in\nToulouse.\n@eoghantotten\nFRIDAY 28 SEPT\n\n"

    "content": "FRESHERS\u2019 PULLOUT\n26 FRIDAY 28 SEPT\nbit.ly/18MPeyr\nfelixonline.co.uk\nCAMPUS FOOD\nT\nhere are lots of places\nto stu\ufb00 your face like a\ngreedy pig (with glasses\non) around campus. Some\nare even super new so\nit\u2019s an adventure. Okay, not a good\nadventure like accidentally walking\ninto an all super model nudist colony,\nbut an adventure nonetheless.\nUnion (1)\nhey serve lunch and dinner food.\nhe food is cheap and almost cheerful.\nWell. It\u2019s more cheerful than a man\nwith vertigo standing on the top of the\nShard. hat\u2019s something. Nachos is a\ngood call and the bar sta\ufb00 are all nice.\nEastside (2)\nJust below Eastside Halls, it\u2019s a\nposh pub, although looks more like\nan American bar. Serves pretty good\nfood at lunch and dinner that is veggie\nfriendly and meat lover friendly too.\nhe prices are low enough that they\nprobably won\u2019t leave you o\ufb00ering \u00a32\nmassages on High Street Ken just to\nget by. So that\u2019s a plus.\nJCR\nhis is, realistically, where you\u2019ll\nend up eating most days. It has all\nyou could want and more. A bunch\nof sandwiches, a deli bar (which is\nactually surprisingly good) and even\na pie and mash/salad bar shop. Back\nin the day you could do the mash\nyourself, now they check, just incase\nyou scam them out of 5p\u2019s worth of\npotato. You\u2019ve been warned. here\u2019s\nalso a fast food counter, if you\u2019re into\nthat sort of thing. By that, I mean\nrejected KFC food. here\u2019s a pancake\nplace too, but they aren\u2019t proper\ncrepes really: it\u2019s essentially rubber\nwith some Nutella on top. Yum yum.\nQTR\nIf you want hot food then this is\nyour place to go. It always has a noodle\nbased option, and a meal deal. You get\na drink, dessert and a main for pretty\ncheap. Word of warning though: if\nyou get a hot dessert eat it \ufb01rst so it\ndoesn\u2019t end up going cold \u2013 made that\nmistake too many times. If you want\nto be a true pro, and piss o\ufb00 the chef a\nbit, ask for an omelette.\nLibrary Cafe\nWhy would I need to go here? I\nwon\u2019t be in the Library long enough to\nneed sustenance. I\u2019ll be out raving with\nTinie Tempah and the other freshers.\nFrom semester to semester. Where do\nyou think you are? UCL? Nah, you\u2019ll\nactually be doing work and stu\ufb00. So,\nsorry to say, but, this will become\na main eatery. It has all the energy\ndrinks you could want (and many\nyou don\u2019t want). Plus it has wraps\nthat probably won\u2019t kill you. here\u2019s\nalso the infamous jacket potatos. I\nheard tell of a couple breaking up\nafter sharing one in the Library Cafe.\nPossibly they broke up because he\nwanted beans and she wanted cheese\nand the two together just didn\u2019t work.\nhat became a metaphor for their\nfailing relationship and it had to end.\nOr one of them cheated on the other.\nEither way, at least they were full at\nthe end of it. he legends working\nthere pile on the cheese and beans to\nheroic amounts. So take advantage.\nDepartment Cafes\nLoads of departments have their\nown cafes. Essentially small counters\nwith tea, co\ufb00ee, sandwiches and\ndrinks. he SAF Cafe is pretty good.\nhe Business School one too. he\nothers are great for a cheeky chocolate\nbar to eat in lectures while you try to\nunderstand if it is maths or a foreign\nlanguage being written on the board.\nSCR\nhis is only for postgrads and\nlecturers, unfortunately. However,\nthe breakfast is for all. How liberal of\nthem. If you can drag yourself in early\nenough, give it a go. It\u2019s amazingly\ncheap and they have everything\nyou could want. he hash browns\nare gorgeous. You\u2019re missing out if\nyou don\u2019t go. Honestly, try this: pile\nyour plate with everything you could\nimagine eating. Go to the checkout.\nBe amazed at how it is still under \u00a35.\nOther\nCollege will be changing some areas\nby the time you get here so look forward to the new \u201cCollege Cafe\u201d near\nthe main entrance and a new outlet in\nthe JCR!\nNEAR CAMPUS\nFOOD\nB\nored of eating the\nsame rotation of three\nsandwiches and a Twix\nfor lunch and dinner every\nday? Well you should be.\nBut never fear, there are tales of places\nnot near the Library where one can\neat.\nThe Sandwich Shop (9)\nhis is like a mature student who\nsucks up to a lecturer: an old favourite.\nMore accurately, though, it\u2019s like a\nshop that has a bewildering amount\nof sandwich choices. here\u2019s also\nGreen\ufb01eld\u2019s near South Ken station\nfor an artisan sandwich. he goat\u2019s\ncheese one is a solid bet.\nCaffe Forum\nhis place has possibly the best\npizzas in London. hey are thin and\nyummy. Plus, between 4-7pm they\nare all \u00a35, no matter what size you\nget. Amazing right? Also have a large\nselection of pastas, quiches, and some\nsandwiches. If you want a morning\nperk, go for a co\ufb00ee and get a free\ncroissant. Near Gloucester Road is\nalso he Diner, and a Neros (23) with\nthe com\ufb01est sofas ever. Great for\ndoing work in a chilled environment.\nHigh Street Ken\nhere\u2019s anything you could want\nhere. Wagamamas (32) is a good\nshout \u2013 free green tea is a plus. Gira\ufb00e\n(31) are incredibly friendly and have\na special Imperial deal (they did last\nyear, don\u2019t kill me if it is no longer\nthere). Just show your College card for\na discount. Of course there\u2019s also all\nthe big chains around too.\nSouth Ken\nOriental Canteen (14) and\nChopstix (15) are great for a quick\n(erm, oily) snack.\nIMPERIAL COLLGE LONDON\n\n"
