    "content": "The Emotional Context\nIf I am being honest with myself,\nI became anti-relationship after a series\nof failed relationships and situationships\n- as do most people after having gone\nthrough a breakup. In the spirit of a\ntrue Imperial student, I turned to books\nabout relationships (I should note mainly books written by feminists), wanting\nthem to convince me further that relationships would not benefit me, and\neven go as far as to hinder me. It worked.\nSo now I am not only anti-relationship\ndue to heartbreak, but I also have real\nammunition behind my personal belief\nwhich I have attempted to articulate in\nthis article.\nThe Nuclear Family and\nHaving a Career\nAfter reading \u2018Why I\u2019m not a Feminist\u2019 by Jessa Crispin, I felt so enraged\nthat women were almost condemned to\nthis life of being born, educated, told to\ngetajob,thenexpectedtogiveallthatup\nto dedicate their lives to raising a family.\nJust because we have ovaries. I refused to\nbelieve that this would be the series of\nevents that describe my life because, as a\nwoman, I am \u2018innately more maternal\u2019. I\nwould like to quickly mention that I do\nnot see the issue with wanting that life\nfor yourself as a woman. It goes without\nsaying that being a mother is commend-able. But what I do not like, was the fact\nthat this was a \u2018given\u2019 in society. It is the\nexpectation of whatever man that I may\none day meet, that he will not give up his\ncareer to raise my children. Because why\nwould he? He is told that it is in his biology to be the strong, responsible provider in our nuclear family.\nI like the idea of the house-husband.\nWomen can be the providers, particularly as technology has developed i.e., the\ncontraceptive pill allowing women to\nprolong having children in order to pri-oritise their careers. But should the liberation of the working woman be at the\nexpense of her husband who has worked\nequally hard to get his dream career?\nNot if he doesn\u2019t want to. I cannot understand why anyone, regardless of gen-der, would willingly sacrifice all they had\nworked for to have a family. Why must\nanyone compromise? The formation of\nnuclear families, based on the argument\nof human biology, has historically benefitted men but even with these develop-ments, it is still oppressive to the parent\nwho must undergo the sacrifice.\nThe next argument is that you can\nhaveboth.Thisisthesolutionconcocted\nto prevent the dissolution of the nuclear\nfamily which is the basis for the whole of\nsociety.Toomuchchangewouldbescary\nso we need to tell the girls something\nthat will stop them from thinking too\nhard about it. That\u2019s it. We will tell them\nthey can be a CEO and then go home to\ntheir mansions to their gorgeous, rich\nhusband and kiss their straight A* children goodnight. Maybe this is possible.\nWith money and with help i.e., a nanny\nfor your baby or a private tutor to help\nyour child with their homework. Can\nthe average working woman afford this\nlevel of extra care needed for her to have\nboth? In 2021 the average salary for a\nwoman was \u00a328,305. So, let us say that\nthe average successful woman is on a\nsalary of about 20% more than that, so\n\u00a333600. Full time nursery care in the\nUK averages at about \u00a314,000 which\nis 41.7% of her salary. This is not taking into account the quality of the care.\nWould this be providing the best quality of life for your child? Even if it was,\nwhat about emotional care? Is it ethical\nto have someone else raise your child?\nFinally, what about having children in\nlater life? Maybe you are lucky enough\nto see an early retirement on the hori-zon.

At 25, the rate of\nan embryo having Down syndrome at\nweek 10 of pregnancy is 0.09%. At 35,\nthis rises to 0.42% and by 45, the Down\nsyndrome rate increases to 5.3%. It begs\nthe question of, commitment to success\nor commitment to survival? It is my belief that you cannot have both and do\nboth well.\nChildren and the\nEnvironment\nIt is almost trendy now to care about\nthe environment. Buying from charity\nshops is \u2018cool\u2019 and God forbid you buy\nfrom Pretty Little Thing. Look how fast\nMolly Mae gets attacked after benefitting from the capitalist structure which\nis slowly murdering the planet. These\nsame keyboard warriors that will turn\ntheir noses up at you for not going vegan\nor for shopping at Zara (mostly) do not\nrealise how hypocritical they are. Morgan Stanley analysts believe that having\na child is 7-times worse for the climate\nin annual CO2 emissions than the next\n10 mitigants at the individual-level.\nOverpopulation comes with overcon-sumption; one child equates to about\n58.6 tonnes of carbon each year. We do\nnot consider how our relationships may\nbe impacting the environment when we\nshame someone for not recycling.\nThe Biology of Monogamy\nJessa Crispin had convinced me that\nI do not want to sacrifice a career for a\nfamily. The next logical step for me was\nto challenge my perception of romantic relationships. So, I read \u2018Untrue\u2019 by\nWednesday Martin for an insight into\nthe alternatives to monogamy.\nAll of my family are monogamous. I\nhad grown up thinking this is what happens because it works in the best way.\nHowever, Martin hinted to me that this\nmight not be the case.\nGenerally, it is accepted that women\nare the more monogamous gender. Men\ncan \u2018spread their seed\u2019 and impregnate\nmultiple women at one time whereas\nwomen can only fall pregnant by one\nman at a time. By natural selection, we\nwant the best offspring and so women\nshould be more judicious in their choice\nof men to better their chances here. Stephen Fry even went as far as to claim\nthat women do not even enjoy sex. He\nbelieves they see it as \u2018the price to pay for\na relationship\u2019.\n\u2018Untrue\u2019 unveils the truth that this\nassumption is a lie. Between 2018 and\n2019, women were found to cheat 40%\nmore in monogamous relationships\nthan in previous years. A study by Meana concluded that familiarity of spouse\ndecreases the female libido as opposed\nto males who were likely to report sexual satisfaction from sex with a long-term\npartner.\nI encourage you to pick up the book\nfor more extensive statistics, but I had\nconcluded that women are not necessarily the monogamous beings that I had\ngrown up thinking. Women cheat just as\nmuch as men. Women like sex as much\nas men. But why are we so committed to\nthe idea of a happy ending in a monogamous relationship, if we are going to be\ndisloyal? As a 20-year-old, it is impossible for me to imagine how it feels to be\ntethered to one other human being for\n60 years. I have known my parents for\n20 years and that is my longest standing relationship to a human. One can\nimagine that after 60 years, you may get\nbored or look outside of your romantic\nrelationship for stimulation, may that be\nintellectual or sexual. This is where poly-amory offers a solution. We have infinite\nlove for multiple friends, parents have\ninfinite love for multiple children. Why\ndo we limit ourselves to just one romantic partner? Polyamory offers a logical\nsolution, yet it is not quite accepted as\n\u2018normal\u2019 by society.\nLove is Not the Problem\nI am not anti-love. Love is amazing\nand I love many people in my life. The\nproblem is the weighting that romantic\nlove has in the decision-making process\nthat young women undertake when\ncrafting the paths that will be their fu-ture.\nYou just have to open TikTok or Instagram to see pictures of happy couples\nwith millions of likes. Society values\nmonogamy, not love. It seems that if you\nare in a relationship, then you must be\ndesirable and therefore you are higher\nup the food chain. We envy people in\nhappy relationships, but we do not envy\nourselves despite having other forms of\nlove in our lives.\nOntheothersideofthecoin,thereare\nthe female influencers living their \u2018hotgirl summer\u2019. We love to see empowered,\nsingle women and we celebrate them as\nfeminists. But do we seek personal improvement in order to make ourselves\nmore attractive on the romantic market?\nIt is a pessimistic view, but a valid one.\nI worry that we place so much emphasis on the importance of romantic\nrelationships that we lose sight of things\nthat matter more.\nThis is my opinion, but I hope it made\nyou uncomfortable. I hope somewhere,\nyou felt angry that you slightly agreed\nwith me. We are convinced from a young\nage that this is what we need to do. Enter\na monogamous relationship and have a\nfamily. Do not think about it too much\nbecause you will be unhappy. Well, I am\nthinking, and I am unhappy. Thinking\nabout it and challenging the expected\nallows me to make decisions now, while\nI am in my 20s, that I hope will result in\nme living a happier and more fulfilled\nlife. If you disagree, please convince me I\nam wrong. Because that would definitely\nbe an easier fate to accept. It is the default after all.\nPhoto credits: Cottonbro on Pexels\nThe polyamorous \u2018throuple\u2019\nPhoto credits: Sasha Kim on Pexels\nWomen can find love, happiness, and fulfilment outside of monogamous relationships.\n\n"

Science gives us knowledge, but only philosophy can give us wisdom.\u201d\n- Will Durant\nWhat are the most important problems facing humanity today and how should we address them? These\nare, at heart, philosophical questions: they concern\nvalues, and ask how we ought to act. Imperial College\nLondon is one of the world\u2019s leading universities, and\nhence, one of the institutions that\nwe can depend on both to ask, and\nanswer, such questions. Yet, Imperial has no philosophy department,\nin fact, it has no substantial humanities departments at all. When conducting research on science which\naffects humanity, scientists need to\nbe aware of the long-term implications of this research.\nThe university focuses exclusively on science and technology and\nthe culture is one of productively\ncontinuing the march of scientific\nprogress. In addition, strong industry connections naturally focus\nresearch efforts on concrete appli-cations. What is often lacking is a carefully considered\nview of what we ought to do with the machinery of sci-ence. This is apparent in the day-to-day lives of many of\nthe researchers and students at Imperial. For students,\nthe workloads are heavy, the deadlines numerous and\nfrequent, and the focus is on training to quickly produce practical results. This is good training for a role in\nindustry but there is less time, under this regime, for reflection on what has been learned, and less encouragement to step back and evaluate one\u2019s long-term goals,\nor the goals of the society which these students will\nhelp to shape. The case is similar for researchers, many\nof whom fall prey to the \u201cpublish or perish\u201d game. Pressures to pump-out as many papers as possible naturally\nlead to those papers\u2019 focusing on safe, incremental re-sults; again, there is less room for reflecting upon the\npurpose of research, advancing riskier but more important directions, or covering new ground.\nThese issues surrounding the culture of Imperial are,\nat least in part, a consequence of the minimal humanities and a neglect of philosophical thinking. Culture is\ninherently a product of the individuals who make up a\ncommunity. Since the individuals who make up Imperial are, in the vast majority, scientists and engineers,\nthe ideas and norms of the community are technocrat-ic and technosolutionistic. If the Imperial community\nincluded more social scientists and philosophers, this\nwould expand its diversity of thought and broaden the\nrange of ideas under discussion. In particular, more\nphilosophical thinking would lead to an appreciation\nof the big picture questions such as \u201cwhat is our research for?\u201d.\nThis is not to disparage the brilliant scientists working at Imperial, nor their contributions. The latter are\nof very real value to the world and help improve the\nlives of many people (e.g., the work done at Imperial\non pandemic risk and climate change is evidently im-portant). But the incentives inherent in the culture\nstifle the abilities of researchers to\naddress the questions that we accept as important and prevent some\nquestions from being asked at all.\nHowever, at Oxford, Cambridge,\nand other universities around the\nworld, there is an emerging community of researchers who explicitly look to ask and answer the big\nquestions facing humanity. At the\nFuture of Humanity Institute, the\nCentre for the Study of Existential\nRisk, the Stanford Existential Risk\nInitiative, and a few other institutes\nin major universities, multi-discipli-nary teams of academics bring the\ntools of mathematics, philosophy,\nand social sciences to bear on big-picture questions\nabout humanity and its long-term prospects.\nAmong these communities there is a growing appreciation for the value of considering humanity\u2019s\nlong-term future, and a belief that the present may be\none of the most important time-periods in humanity\u2019s\nlifespan. Fuelled by technological progress, we are in a\nperiod of unprecedented power over the future. Nuclearmissiles,advancedartificialintelligence,andbiologi-calweaponsarejustsomeofthetechnologieshumanity\ncould use to destroy itself. Yet, our technological progress has not been matched by a corresponding growth\nin wisdom. We lack the moral and philosophical maturity to protect ourselves, and our future descendants,\nfrom irremediable mistakes.\nLuckily, it\u2019s not too late! Imperial\u2019s new initiative\n\u201cI-X\u201d is a multidisciplinary environment for research\nacross emerging digital technologies which aims to\n\u201cbuild a better future\u201d. But it has no philosophers! No\nsocial scientists! I-X is an opportunity for Imperial to\nchange its culture, to invite a wider range of voices to\nthe table, and to give genuine philosophical thought to\nthe future of humanity.\nIn short, Imperial College London is undoubtedly\none of the best scientific institutes in the world. But it\nis not enough to continuously turn the wheels of sci-ence; without a greater appreciation for philosophical\nquestions of the value and purpose of research, we run\nthe risk of driving an accelerating car without stopping\nto think about the direction in which we are headed.\nPhilosophy is not dead!\nFrancisRhysWard\nWriter\nTo answer the important questions, Imperial needs to embrace philosophy\nFUELLED BY\nTECHNOLOGICAL\nPROGRESS,\nWE ARE IN A\nPERIOD OF\nUNPRECEDENTED\nPOWER OVER THE\nFUTURE\n\u201c Photo credits: Unsplash, @nasa\nPlanet Earth from Space\nThis was the first Comment article I edited as Comment Editor in the Autumn\nterm, and it was a superb start to a year\nfilled with brilliant articles. Furthermore, Francis Rhys Ward\u2019s message is perhaps only going to become increasingly\nrelevant in the next few years and this is\nwhy I am bringing this article back. Imperial is home to some of the most intelligent\nand hard-working people I have ever met,\nbut I am often concerned about how this\nfast-paced academic environment does not\nfoster a culture of ethics. Ward explores\nhis concerns in this article too, which is\nwhy I believe it is a necessary read.\n\n"

Through the various\nencounters our narrator has\nwith Selwyn, we find him to\nbe a man disillusioned and\nwithdrawn. He no longer\nplays tennis, his great pas-sion, he says, as the court has fallen into disrepair. His\nkitchen gardens are similarly dilapidated, as are the\nVictorian greenhouses, tumbled down and overgrown\nwith fruit trees. \u2018More and more, he\nsaid, he sensed that Nature itself was\ngroaning and collapsing beneath the\nburden we placed upon it\u2019. Later, we learn that Selwyn had\nemigrated from Lithuania at\nthe age of seven. As he reminisces about \u2018the high seas,\nthe trail of smoke, the distant\ngreyness, the lifting and falling\nof the ship, the fear and hope\nwithin us, all of it\u2019, the source\nof Selwyn\u2019s malaise makes itself\nevident.\nAs we move on from Selwyn, the\nnarrator recalls the lives of his other protagonists; a teacher from his\nchildhood, an aviator\u2019s companion,\nand a German-Jewish painter sent to\nManchester by his parents before the\nSecond World War. The final story, focusing on the\npainter - Max Ferber - shares the elegiac tone of the\nothers, depicting post-war Manchester to be in bleak,\nterminal decline. Ferber, whom the narrator encounters twice, two decades apart, shows that same stagna-tion, as he is unable to finish his own paintings, repeatedly scratching off and\nreapplying paint. In\nthe latter stages of the\nsection, the narrator\nis handed a letter that\nFerber\u2019s mother had\nwritten to him before\nsending him off. It contains a depiction of an\nidyllic Bavarian life,\nthat his mother must\nhave led in her own youth. Though initially acting as a\nquiet form of respite from the enveloping moroseness,\nit is the context of the letter and knowledge of what is\nto come for its characters that exposes the true themes\nand emotional core of the novel, that is, the trauma\nafflicted to those dislocated by the World Wars, and\ntheir consequent feelings of alienation and disembodied nostalgia.\nFRIDAY 24TH JUNE 2022\n19\nBOOKS\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\u201c\nDEALING WITH\nTHEMES OF\nDECAY, MEMORY,\nNOSTALGIA\nThe Appeal\nJanice\nHallett\nEast of Eden\nJohn\nSteinbeck\nWhere\nRainbows End\nCecelia Ahern\nTreasure Island\nRobert Louis\nStevenson\nHow to Save\nOur Planet*\nProf. Mark Maslin\nGreat Circle\nMaggie\nShipstead\nThe Amur\nRiver*\nColin Thubron\nDune\nFrank\nHerbert\nThe Girl with the\nLouding Voice\nAbi Dar\u00e9\nStone\u2019s Fall\nIain\nPears\nH is for Hawk*\nHelen\nMacDonald\nMurder by the\nSeaside\nCecily Gayford\nLessons in\nChemistry\nBonnie Garmus\nAround the World\nin 80 Plants*\nJonathan Drori\nThe Island of\nMissing Trees\nElif Shafak\nLiquid Rules*\nMark\nMiodownik\nA Brief History\nof the Earth*\nAndrew H.

    "content": "Paul Ehrlich was a\nGerman scientist\nthat contributed enormously to the fields\nof immunology and\nchemotherapy, winning\na Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1908 for his\nwork with antibodies to\nfight against diphtheria.\nHe was a strong believer\nin the potential of science to help society and\nthis was reflected in his life dedicated to\nresearch. From his undergraduate days,\nEhrlich was obsessed with the idea that\ndifferent chemicals can effect microorganisms and tissue in a variety of ways.\nHe was the pioneer in connecting chem-istryandbiologyforamedicinalpurpose\nthrough the usage of chemical dyes. He\nwas a genius, without doubt, and earned\nthe nickname \u2018virtuoso of test tubes\u2019, but\nhe had some quirks such as smoking 25\ncigarettes per day or carrying very sharp\ncolour pencils in his pocket.\nAt the beginning of the 19th\ncentury,\nthere was not any synthetic drug\ndeveloped yet. Plant extracts were\nwidely used to cure many diseases but\nwithout knowing the particular healing\nmolecule behind them. Even though\nplant extracts could sometimes treat\nmild ailments, they were futile against\nmore serious ones like syphilis. Ehrlich\nthought that particular chemicals could\nact effectively against one disease in\nspecific without causing any side effects.\nThat is, the concept of magic bullet\nemerged. Imagine a bullet that could\nchange its direction, dodging different\nobstacles on its way, just to hit precisely\nthe target without harming anyone\nelse. Ehrlich thought this could real\nbut with a drug and the disease instead\nof the bullet and the target. The magic\nbullet of Ehrlich was too innovative\nfor his time and he was mocked by his\ncolleagues, but this did not\nstop him. His conviction\nwas much stronger than\nthe na\u00efve criticism of\nothers. He spent many\nhours testing different\nsynthetic chemicals\nfor their potential use\nin therapeutics until\ncompound 606, a game-changing discovery.\nBefore the 1900s,\nsyphilis, a sexually\ntransmitted bacterial\ninfection, was treated with mercury,\nwhich is extremely toxic. In 1909,\nSahachiro Hata travelled from Japan to\nGermany in order to work as a research\nassistant for Ehrlich. He discovered that\narsphenamine, discarded by previous\nassistants, was effective against syphilis\nby testing in vivo with rabbits. The\nreason for negative results in the past\nwas attributed to the poor methodology\nof the other assistants. Arsphenamine\nwas named compound 606 as it was the\n6th\nchemical test by Ehrlich and Hata.\nThe chemical was later commercialised\nas Salvarsan, which is considered the\nfirst magic bullet as Salvarsan kills\nmainly pathogenic bacteria and has\nfewer side effects compared to mercury.\nSalvarsan is also the first antibiotic ever\ncreated. Despite Salvarsan achieving\nthese two milestones, there were\nmany sectors, particularly religious,\nreluctant to accept Salvarsan in Europe\nbecause they viewed syphilis as a\ndivine punishment to sinners. Another\nimportant contribution of Salvarsan\nto science was the establishment of the\nmethodology to develop new drugs and\ninfluencedgreatlythecommercialisation\nof penicillin, discovered 19 years after\nlater by Alexander Fleming at Imperial,\nwhich substituted Salvarsan as a remedy\nagainst syphilis.\nThe objective of Ehrlich's magic bullet\nwas to kill pathogenic microbes whilst\ndoing the least possible damage to other\nbody cells. However, this is a problem\nwhen your own cells are trying to kill\nyou! This is cancer, the most infamous\ndisease in the world. 50% of people will\nget cancer at some stage of their lives\nand it is one of the major causes of death\nworldwide. The magic bullet inspired\nand encouraged future scientists to\ndevelop novel therapies to fight against\ncancer using chemicals, saving many\nlives.Thescientistsfollowedtheresearch\nand thinking principles of Ehrlich, who\nalso coined the term chemotherapy for\nthe first time.\nEhrlich defied the standard medicine\nof his time, which was tremendously\ninefficient and dangerous, for a new\nidea with more accuracy and fewer side\neffects. Now, 115 years since his ideation\nof the magic bullet, the magic bullet is\nmore alive than ever!\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nWang Guo Science Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\n115 years since the magic bullet\nScience Writer Wang Guo tells the story of Paul Ehrlich, who devoted his life to research and revolutionised\nmedicine with the first antibiotic and origin of chemotherapy\nPaul Ehrlich and Sahachiro Hata\nPaul Ehrlich\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia Commons, Hata Memorial Museum\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia Commons\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 24TH JUNE 2022\n15\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStupid Title, Enjoyably Stupider Music\nWritten by Hahyun Lee Environment Editor\nA look back at Music for Planets, People & Washing Machines by Randy Bernsen.\nAlbum Reviews\nJaco Pastorius is considered one of the greatest electric bass players of all time. From his debut record\nin 1975 to his death in 1987, he recorded with a wide\nvariety of artists, showcasing his impressive versatility\nas a bassist, whether it be through his use of harmonics\nand 16th note grooves as part of the jazz fusion group\nWeather Report, or his expressive fretless playing on\nJoni Mitchell\u2019s Hejira. If you scroll through his discography on Wikipedia, as I did the other day, you\nmay recognise some other names: Herbie Hancock,\nPat Metheny, Little Beaver (??), but one curious title\ncaught my eye. In 1984, Pastorius recorded bass for\n2 tracks on Randy Bernsen\u2019s debut album: Music for\nPlanets, People & Washing Machines.\nEven odder is the album art. A low resolution stock\nillustration of the solar system, with the Milky Way\nsplattered in the middle of it, surrounded by MS Paint\nquality lines depicting a television, I presume. Under\nit, 3 white stick figures, and Randy\u2019s name printed\ndiagonally in all caps. This album truly asks you not\nto judge a book by its cover. Nonetheless, press play.\n\u2018Sir Yellow Bird\u2019 kicks off with a sweet synthesizer\nrun played by Bernsen, which is promptly \u2018woooo\u2019d by\nMike Couzzi (credited as doing \u2018noises\u2019 in the album\ntracklist). After some chords, Bernsen enters a long,\nspacey funk solo over some tight drums with a possibly\nregrettable jagged synth patch. The track is mercifully saved by a smoother Rhodes solo, only for Bernsen\u2019s\nsynth to make a reprise at the end to see the 7 minute\ntrack off. \u2018Conehead Bop\u2019 follows a similar trajectory,\nthough a lot easier on the ears, particularly the vocals\ninterjecting with \u2018conehead bop\u2019 during the solos, making for a charming listen. Later on, a reggae version\nof the jazz standard \u2018My Funny Valentine\u2019, with a very\nmuch non-jazz guitar solo attached, because why not.\nPerhaps I have been too harsh. These compositions\nare strong, each track having an undeniable drive to\nthem, infectious rhythms and impeccably performed\nrhythm sections. A return to the album cover reveals\nthe other immense talents behind this project, such as\nthe aforementioned jazz legend Herbie Hancock and\nWeather Report\u2019s drummer Peter Erskine. In fact, it is\nin track 3, \u2018Olde Hats\u2019, that Erskine and Pastorius first\nfeature, and it was at this moment that I was convinced\nof this album\u2019s brilliance. Reminiscent of Pastorius\u2019\nown work with his big band (particularly of Liberty City), with its steel drums and Jaco\u2019s characteristic\nmuted bass accents and double stops, accompanied\nwith confident horns, this likely would be the most\nimmediate track for newcomers. I will also admit that\nthis is the only \u2018normal\u2019 track the album has to offer.\nI do think this album is worth your time. The musi-cianshipisexcellent,evenifitisinserviceof,admittedly,\nvery \u2018out-there\u2019 compositions. Whether you choose to\nlisten for Pastorius, Hancock, or whatever the hell the\nvocals are doing on \u2018Windsong\u2019, this album will at the\nveryleastentertainifslightlyconfuse.ButIwon\u2019tblame\nyou if you choose to not give the record a second spin.\nI\u2019m already kind of sick of listening to it for this review.\nMUSIC\nhad been unable to surpass the newly released songs.\nThis was due to a Top 40 rule to give newer artists a\nchance at breaking through the highly streamed clas-sics. In this, older songs require 200 subscription service streams (e.g. Spotify Premium) or 1,200 ad-fund-ed streams to make one \u201csale\u201d whilst newer artists\nrequire half as many. This rule was revoked for \u2018Running Up That Hill\u2019 by the Supervisory Committee in\na clause regarding percentage weekly sales increase. As\nthis playing field was levelled and the stream-to-sale ratios became the same, a rapid lead was seen with Kate\nBush receiving an additional 5,000 streams within a\nday compared to previous chart topper Harry Styles.\nAlongside this, Kate Bush now holds the records for oldest female artist to have a number one hit and the longest time for a single\nto reach number one \u2013 a whopping 37 years.\nThisgaphashighlightedtheimportanceofexploring\ngenres of music and being inclusive in usage throughout media as young listeners are now avidly working\ntheir way through her catalogue of work.

    "content": "This is a book about a man you\u2019ve never heard of; a\ncity you don\u2019t live in; and politics that happened\nbefore you were born. But even though The Power Brokercameoutalmost50yearsago,itremainsunmissable\nfor anyone interested in the inner workings of politics\nand corruption.\nThe Power Broker is usually described as a biography\nof Robert Moses, New York public official. While this\nis true, the word \u2018biography\u2019 fails to do justice to the\nbook\u2019s sheer scale. From the intricacies of civil service\nreform to the various promises and threats that can be\n(and were!) used to pass legislation, the book is a deep\ndive into the way politics works in the real world, and\nhow Robert Moses used and abused its systems during\nhis four decades in power.\nThe book has received praise from many modern\npoliticians, with a testimonial\nfrom Barack Obama featuring\nprominently on the back cover,\nand even had a brief stint during the pandemic as a Zoom\nbackground status symbol.\nAs you would expect from\na biography, it follows Robert\nMoses\u2019 life chronologically, but\nfrom the very start, author Robert Caro\u2019s attention to\ndetail is clear. He starts even before Moses\u2019 birth, with\na history of his grandparents and his mother. This level\nof context \u2013 memorably brought to life using storytelling techniques from the world of fiction \u2013 is a hallmark\nof Caro\u2019s work. Throughout the book, he devotes enormous amounts of time to explaining the systems - city\ngovernment, parks, the New Deal, public authorities,\nurban renewal \u2013 that Moses worked with and held\npower over.\nAll this detail makes the book extremely long. At\n600,000words,it\u2019sarealdoorstopper.However,it\u2019salso\nincredibly gripping. The Power Broker is a page-turner\nthat often feels like a political drama novel, but with\nthe gravity of being a true story. The main character is\nclearly not a good man \u2013 one can simply look at his\ncontempt for poor people and people of colour \u2013 but\nafter reading about his unparalleled feats of political\nachievement, it\u2019s impossible not to have a sense of awe\nfor his skill at playing the political game.\nIndeed, Caro is clear in his presentation of the incredible competence and intelligence of Moses. One\nstandout moment occurs in 1946, when he was involved in bringing the UN\nheadquarters to New York.\n\u2018Without reference to a single law book\u2019, he dictated a\nmemorandum with the details of the city\u2019s surrender of\nEast River bulkheads - which\nwould have taken teams of\nlawyers days to research.\nThey later found the memorandum to be correct down\nto the last comma. When Moses was brought in, there\nwere four days until decision day and the UN had\nlooked certain to be located in Philadelphia. Four days\nlater, everything had changed.\nThis doorstopper of a book is more than Zoom window dressing. It\u2019s more than a biography of a New York\npublic official. The Power Broker is nothing less than an\nessential insight into power, politics, and democracy.\nEdited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n18\nThe Power Broker: Robert Moses and the\nFall of New York\nBook Review\nTanuj Dhir Books Writer\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n\u201c\n\u2018BIOGRAPHY\u2019 FAILS TO\nDO JUSTICE TO THE\nBOOK\u2019S SHEER SCALE\nWG Sebald\u2019s style of prose, despite being quaint\nand even accessible on a sentence-by-sentence\nbasis, is wholly unique. His novels often consist of a\nseries of seemingly unconnected narratives framed\nthrough the recollections of the narrator. However,\nonce these novels are finished, the precision and deliberation with which he structures these narratives becomes more than apparent to the reader.

    "content": "Just over a year from the release of Wolf Alice\u2019s stellar album Blue Weekend, the Brit award-winning\nband are back with their own new take on acoustic\ncovers of their hits, an endeavour bands all inevitably\ndelve into. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions though, Blue\nLullaby is far from a regular acoustic album. As the\nname suggests the new takes on old songs are not just\nmeant to be covers that we expect with a stripped\nback acoustic guitar and vocals,\nthey are meant to be calming lullabies that soothe and nurture us.\nWhen I first listened to Blue\nWeekend, I was just finishing my\nfirst year of university in London\nand facing a move back home for\nthe summer. Just as the city was\nopening up again after lockdowns,\nI wasn\u2019t wanting to leave so I made\nthe most of my time here last June\nand those memories are solidly\nlinked to the music I was devoutly listening to at the\ntime \u2013 Blue Weekend. Now, a year later, Blue Lullaby\nhas made me reminisce with its intimate takes on\n\u2018Lipstick On The Glass\u2019, \u2018How Can I Make It OK?\u2019, \u2018No\nHard Feelings\u2019, \u2018Feeling Myself\u2019 and \u2018The Last Man on\nEarth\u2019.\nTo transform the tracks into lullabies fit to rock a\nbaby to sleep, Wolf Alice have traded booming drums\nand fuzzy guitars for fingerpicked rhythms, string\naccompaniments and laid-back percussion. \u2018The Last\nMan on Earth\u2019 and \u2018No Hard Feelings\u2019 already felt\nlike lullabies, so these changes are most noticeable on\n\u2018Feeling Myself\u2019 where gigantic synths in the bridge\nhave been swapped for elegant orchestral melodies.\nYou wouldn\u2019t expect there to be room for a string\nquartet to fit by a baby\u2019s bedside,\nso the most important part of a\nlullaby is usually the vocals and Ellie\nRoswell\u2019s angelic vocals fit all the\ntracks perfectly. These stand out in\nthe songs where the instrumentation\ntakes a back seat to exhibit Roswell\nherself. \u2018No Hard Feelings\u2019 is ethereal\nwith only a piano accompaniment\nand \u2018The Last Man on Earth\u2019 builds\nup to a particularly celestial chorus\nwith a choir of Roswell\u2019s belting out\nharmonies to end the EP.\nBlue Weekend was such a beautifully unique album\nand I think this is what makes everyone listening have\nsuch an individual connection to it. Nostalgia for a\nsummery London I was about to leave is mine and I\u2019m\nsure there are thousands of others that will be awoken\nby the even more personal Blue Lullaby.\n14 Music.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Tara Pal Chaudhuri\nJoe Riordan\nMusic\nView online here!\nBeabadoobee\u2019s iconic blend of unique\ninstrumentation\noverlaying a catchy\nbubblegum pop sound\nis always welcome to\nthe alternative ear in\nsearch of something\nwith actual melody.

    "content": "Accessing the internet is a\nfundamental part of modern life.\nAs technology has progressed, so have\nthe methods for delivering internet\naccesstoourdevices\u2013wehavegonefrom\nthe early days of dial-up to broadband,\nfibre optics, and five generations of\ncellular networks. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX\nhopes to disrupt the internet industry by\nproviding internet access via satellites.\nSatellite internet is not a new\ntechnology \u2013 the first launch of an\ninternet-capable satellite was in 2003,\nwith several launches from multiple\ncompaniesfollowingintheyearsthathave\nfollowed. These satellites have typically\nbeen launched into geosynchronous\norbits, where the satellite remains in the\nsame area of the sky above the surface of\nEarth. This has two main advantages;\na very simple antenna can be used, and\none satellite can service a very large area\nofthesurface.Thesideeffectofthisorbit\nis the large distance from Earth, which\nlimits speeds and causes any information\nto be delayed by around 250ms (known\nas latency) \u2013 this is the amount of time\nit takes light to travel to the satellite and\nback. While this does not sound like a\nlot, it makes many of the modern uses\nof the internet such as gaming and voice\ncommunications effectively impossible.\nSpaceX have solved this problem by\ndeployingmanymoresatellitesinamuch\nlower orbit than their competitors \u2013\nthey have deployed over 2,400 satellites\nin orbits around 550km above the\nsurface, compared to almost 36,000km\nfor geosynchronous satellites. This\nlower distance allows for comparable\nlatencies to traditional, ground-based\ncommunications such as fibre optics,\nandthegreaternumberofsatellitesallow\nfor a higher speed per user. SpaceX has\npermission to launch 12,000 satellites\nand have applied to launch 30,000 more.\nIn order for a stable connection to\nbe maintained, any antenna must be\nable to track a satellite accurately. For\ngeosynchronous satellites, this is easy \u2013\nasthesatellitedoesnotmoveinthesky,a\ndishcanbepointedintherightdirection\nand left there. However, at low altitudes\nsuch as those SpaceX is using, satellites\nappear to move very fast across the sky.\nThis necessitates an incredibly complex\nantenna capable of following the signal\ncoming from the satellite as it moves\nacross the sky. This is not attainable with\na mechanical system \u2013 the antenna must\nbe \u201csteered\u201d electronically.\nThis technology, known as a phased\narray antenna, has not been used widely\noutside of military purposes in the\npast, which leads to high costs. Despite\ncharging users $500 for the equipment\nrequired to connect to Starlink, SpaceX\nisstillmakingalossoneachuser\u2013experts\nestimated the manufacturing cost of the\nvery first units to be over $3000, with\nupdated models still costing over $1000\nper unit to manufacture.\nInternet in the US is often more costly\nandofalowerqualitythanincomparable\ncountries, due to a lack of competition.\nAs a result, in the US, Starlink is able\nto compete with traditional internet\nproviders, coming at a slight premium\nbut often with a better service. This,\nhowever, is very unlikely to translate to\nthe rest of the world.\nIn the UK, the landscape is far more\ncompetitive. Venture capital-backed\nstartups such as CityFibre compete with\nVirgin Media to install fast internet to\nhouseholds, driving down the cost for\ninternet access. Starlink in the UK costs\n\u00a389 per month, with a \u00a3529 set up fee.\nHowever, internet of a better quality can\nalready be had for a third of this price.\nThenumberslookevenworseforSpaceX\nwhen considering developing countries.\nIn India, for example, unlimited 4G\ninternet costs about $3 a month - the\nsetupcostofStarlinkalonecouldpayfor\nalmost 14 years of internet access. As all\nmanufacturing is conducted in the US,\nit is unlikely that SpaceX will be able to\nlower prices in areas with lower incomes\nby taking advantage of lower labour\ncosts \u2013 they will have to choose between\nseverelylimitingtheircustomerbaseand\nkeeping a profit margin.\nThere are several niches in which\nStarlink is currently unbeatable \u2013 for\nexample, when ground-based systems\nwere destroyed, Ukrainians were able\nto access the internet through donated\nStarlink terminals. The technology also\nhas the potential to greatly improve\ninternet access away from land or\ncivilisation, for example on planes\nand ships, and in cell towers in remote\nareas. Once fully deployed, the Starlink\nconstellation could send a message\nover longer distances than traditional\nmethods,aslighttravelsfasterinairthan\nin the glass used in fibre-optic cables.\nThis capability would be highly valued\nby large investment banks and hedge\nfunds, where a slightly faster system\ncould give their trading algorithms an\nedge over competitors. The military\nbenefits of an additional redundant\ncommunications method are clear, and\nSpaceX has already secured a contract\nwith the US Space Force.\nSpaceX are not alone in the satellite\nconstellation space \u2013 competition is\ncoming in the form of OneWeb (part-owned by the UK Government) and\nAmazon\u2019s Kuiper Project. It is unclear\nwhether the niches are wide enough to\nsustain all three companies. SpaceX is\ninvesting over $10 billion to complete\nthe Starlink constellation, and they\nare expecting revenues of over $30\nbillion by 2025. Even accounting for\nmilitary and industrial contracts, there\nare a significant number of individual\ncustomers that SpaceX will need to\nconvince to reach this goal.\nFRIDAY 24TH JUNE 2022\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nDoes SpaceX's Starlink make sense?\nShrey Bohra Tech Writer\nCredit: SpaceX, CC BY-NC 2.0\n60 Starlink satellites stacked together before deployment on 24 May 2019\n\n"

    "content": "Without a doubt, the most impactful story we\ncovered this year was the bullying scandal which\nembroiled President Alice Gast and ex-CFO Muir\nSanderson in 2020 and came to a head earlier in\n2022.\nThe saga was kicked into the public realm when\nan email was sent to all College staff, and later\nstudents, on the 4th\nof December 2020. The message,\nfrom Council Chair John Allan, could scarcely have\nbeen worded more cryptically. We learned that\n\u201callegations were made about senior colleagues\u2019\nconduct, including the President\u201d and that Allan\n\u201cimmediately commissioned an independent\ninquiry and report, to be undertaken by a leading\nQC\u201d. We were not told what the allegations were\nconcerning, nor what the outcome of the report\nwas, as it was being held \u201cconfidential to protect the\nidentities of those who gave evidence\u201d. Nevertheless,\nAllan was \u201cmore confident than ever that Imperial\nhas the right leadership\u201d.\nIt quickly became public knowledge that the\nallegations related to bullying, and requests to\nmake the contents of the QC\u2019s report public came from Imperial College Union, as well as multiple national\nnewspapers.\nThe College initially declined to release the report in order to protect the identity of those who gave evidence, a stance they reinforced through citation of the\nFreedom of Information Act. The Daily Mail challenged this decision, and in January this year, the Information Commissioner finished analysis of the case and found\nin favour of The Daily Mail, ordering the College to release a redacted version of the report.\nThe report was damning, and a number of factors, including a number of inappropriate comments made by Mr Sanderson, meant that he came off far worse that\nPresident Gast.\nOn February 22nd\n, Sanderson emailed all students and staff to announce his resignation, effective from the beginning of September, allowing him just over six\nmonths of what was widely assumed to be gardening leave. Alice made no comment on her leaving date, being already set to leave this summer.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n4 Felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\nIssues 1784 and 1788 - Dongoor Plaza\nThe most eye-catching subject that graced Felix\u2019s\npages this year was the revelation of the statue\nnamed ALERT, designed by Antony Gormley and\nset to be installed at the Imperial South Kensington\ncampus in Autumn this year.

It was only when I was able to double check everything with my Chinese\nfriends that I felt at ease.\nHowever, many people from other\ncountries who speak English as a foreign\nlanguage seem to prefer living with flat-mates of various ethnicities from a range\nof countries - and tend to adapt well to\ntheir new surroundings. This made me\nponder why there is a tendency for Chinese people to tacitly form a united and\nexclusive community of only Chinese,\nand if there is anything wrong with always drowning in a Chinese-only community in a Western country.\nThis phenomenon can be carelessly\ndescribed as a stereotype for Chinese\ngroups \u2013 is it because Chinese people\nare afraid of speaking out? Is it because\nChinese people are introverted? Or\nis it because Chinese culture is simply\nincompatible with that of its Western\ncounterparts?\nNo. I don\u2019t think these are valid explanations for a complex\nChinese community\nnor it should be regarded as normal.\n\u2018Stereotype\u2019, is already\na cliche narrative that\ncan effortlessly evade\nthe essence of the is-sue. Quantities of stereotypes can be seen\nover conversations,\nTV shows, films, and\nnovels, etc. and further self-reinforced in\nChinese people. Generations have been explaining and resisting\nstereotypes, but what\nif this time, we could\nescape this \u201cstereotype\u201d trap and reflect\non the authentic reasons behind it?\nFirst and foremost,\nthere is an indisputable correlation between the establishment of intimate\nChinese communities\nabroad and language\nbarriers. Sometimes, my foreign friends\nwould be curious and ask, \u201chow did you\nget to be fluent in English given that\nyou grew up in China for years?\u201d. I was\nsurprised by this question initially, as I\nknow I am not the most proficient English speaker among Chinese people who\nhave a similar background to me, and I\nalso wonder if they ask the same question to European-looking people who\nspeak English as a foreign language.\nNumerous Chinese people in Europe\nare both fluent in English and eager to\ndiscover more about their new communities through conversation. But\nsometimes their failure to speak natural\nEnglishresultsinbeingviewedinanodd\nlight, which only leads to a further loss\nof confidence about fully integrating\ninto their new environments. A friend\ntold me his imperfect English makes it\nharder to maintain\nclose relationship\nwith foreigners - he\nwas not bold enough\nto bother one after\nthe other to explain\nevery word he did\nnot understand in a\nconversation. It was\neasier for him to end\nup not bothering\nEnglish speakers and\nto fall back on social-ising with Chinese\ncompatriots.\nDifferences in cultures and political\nsystems between China and other coun-tries, in some cases,\nare reasons for such\nsolidarity in Chinese\ngroups, but we cannot overlook how the\noverriding factors of\ntrying to be a model\nminority and the inability to cope with\nthe awkwardness of\nlanguage barriers in\nsocial settings result in the seemingly\nChinese penchant for huddling togeth-er.\nLike my mom\u2019s perceptions in the be-ginning, ethnic and national networks\nmorph into unconscious safe zones and\ninevitably become a key impediment to\nparticipating in a diverse culture. I feel\nthe sentiments of many Chinese people\nwho strive to break out of their ethnic\ncommunities but are stuck in the natural\nChinese huddle. Presumably, these are\nhidden feelings that few people would\nexpress directly but are so critical that\nthey cannot be dismissed with a flippant\n\u201cit\u2019s just a stereotype\u201d.\nNot just the Chinese community, but\nmany other minorities in the UK might\nshare the same feeling whilst reasons of\nthis struggling have been barely told.\nI remind myself that such split feelings should never be ignored, and the\nidentity dilemmas should be visible in\nan explainable way. If all of us, no matter where we are from, can confront\nthe structural reasons behind the \u2018stereotype\u2019 of each homogenous group,\nthen enough of us may be able to break\nthrough the shackles of identity politics;\nsimply to treat each other with more understanding from a human perspective,\nand not to use any preconceptions to define any ethnic group anymore.\nA discussion on the reasons behind why some international students tend to stick within their ethnic or national groups.\nMy Thoughts on the Spontaneous Community of Compatriots and Why Reasons behind its\nFormation Cannot be Ignored\nWanqingChen\nCommentWriter\nThis article continues to\nstand out to me for the reason that Wanqing Chen spoke\non an experience that is shared\nby so many Imperial students,\nyet it is still a poorly understood experience by those who\ndo not relate. In fact, I recall\nthe relatively recent debates\non Imperial Secrets about the\nassimilation of International\nstudents and it is clear to me\nthat there is still a lot of dialogue to be had. As someone\nwho is a british student, but\nfrom an immigrant background\n- I understand the pain of lan-guagebarriers,andthefeeling\nof being hyper-visible to the\npoint where the extent of my\n\u2018assimilation\u2019 is always observa-ble. That said, I also appreciate\nthat the International student\u2019s experience is a unique\none and Chen\u2019s article does an\namazing job at explaining how\nthings that often seem so mi-nor, to home students like me,\ncan create social barriers.

If this name\nis unfamiliar to you, that\u2019s because they\nonly made two games on the original\nPlayStation, neither of which sold\nparticularly well despite critical acclaim:\nTombi! and Tombi! 2 - The Evil Swine\nReturn.\nAt first glance, it may appear as a\nbright, colourful mascot platformer,\nperhaps amusing and nostalgic, but a\nrelic of a bygone era. Upon any closer\ninspection, however, it reveals itself\nto be a unique best-of-both-worlds\nblend of Metroidvania and RPG, with\napproachable but constantly evolving\nmechanics. If you choose to play it,\nthis will be only the first of many an\nenjoyable discovery.\nStarring the titular Tombi, a pink-haired boy who stores all manner of\nthingsinhisstomach,gallopsaroundon\nall fours, and incidentally is absolutely\nshredded, this game sees him travelling\nand unravelling a world populated by\ndwarves, mouse people, and the evil\nKomabuta Pigs, who have placed a\nunique curse on each location, making\nthem perilous to navigate. Tombi\ndefeats enemies by jumping on them to\n\u2018bite\u2019 them and throw them across the\nscreen, and can knock them away with\none of many ranged weapons. Taking\ndamage subtracts from a segmented\nhealth meter a la Super Mario 64.\nThe world is substantially sized, but\nnowhere near being spread too thin,\nand can be navigated progressively\nmore easily as you discover the many\nhidden connections between them.\nThe game utilises many of the\nidiosyncrasies found in Japanese RPGs,\nbutinthemostingeniousandenjoyable\nways possible. \u2018Events\u2019 are bitesized\nobjectives or puzzles that are the main\nmeans of progression, encountered\nusually by stumbling upon them, at\nwhich point they take their place on\na 13-page list. Flicking through and\nseeing all the gaps representing quests\nyet to be found will soon have you\nhooked on exploring the world in a\nbid to find everything this game has to\noffer. Relighting the torch in the prison\nin the Dwarf Village prompts the\nprisoner to make his escape and you to\ncatch him; eating a crying mushroom\nhelps you convince the dwarf who\nguards the secret slide to let you have\na go on it, which spits you out at the\nback end of the Mushroom Forest, etc.\nBy populating this vibrant world with\nso many little interconnected things\nto discover and do, WhooPeeCamp\nhave simultaneously solved the biggest\nproblems with both the Metroidvania\nand the RPG. Fumbling around to find\nthe singular path forward using the\nitemyoujustgothasbeenreplacedwith\nsimply picking an event to complete, or\na character to talk to and seeing where\nit takes you.\nFor those who are put off by\ngradual, granular progression, Tombi!\noffers boss fights in the form of the\naforementioned Komabuta Pigs, who\nare hidden behind invisible doors and\nmust be imprisoned in Evil Pig Bags.\nEach imprisonment lifts the curse\nthat was afflicting the respective area,\ntransforming the world as you play. In\naddition, Tombi will encounter four\nprogressively older Old Men of Time,\nwho will each grant him a key to open a\ndifferent type of chest that he will have\nseen on his journey, blowing the whole\ngame wide open once again. Only a\ncouple of flaws detract from what is\notherwise a joyous experience; a couple\nof areas demand a bit too much of the\nplayer given the limited platforming\nmechanics, and the music tracks,\nalthough pleasant, are often too short\ndue to the limited storage space of the\nCD. After a while spent in an area they\nmight drive you a bit nuts.\nBut with how often this game put\na smile on my face, and how often\nI\u2019ve been coming back to it, these are\nmerely footnotes. The bottom line is\nthat Tombi! is a fantastically enjoyable\nexperience for anyone who may choose\nto play it, regardless of your experience\nwith games or lack thereof, and its\nimaginative timeless design deserves\nfar more recognition than it has ever\nreceived.\nChris Stone Games Writer\nTombi!

    "content": "Howard Shore, and the importance of score\nFRIDAY 24TH JUNE 2022\nEdited by: Jonah Hewett\nEva Borras\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 13\nJonah Hewett Film Editor\nArguably the most critical - and certainly the most\nused - component for generating audience emotional response in film is the score. The score, or the set\nof original musical pieces composed specifically for the\nfilm (in contrast to the soundtrack, which includes the\nuse of already existing music), is written deliberately\nto help evoke the appropriate emotional response for\nthe scene; if a nice character is dying, generally, you\u2019ll\nhear a sad song. And I can think of no better example\nfor a discussion of its importance than Howard Shore\u2019s\nscore for The Lord of the Rings, which in full disclosure\nis my favourite of all time. Shore\u2019s work for LOTR is\nnotable for its sheer length, its broad stylistic range,\nand the extensive use of leitmotif. If you aren\u2019t famil-iar, leitmotif is the name commonly given to a short\nmusical phrase that is repeatedly used to represent or\nallude to a specific idea, place, or character. Famous\nexamples include Darth Vader\u2019s famous \u2018Imperial\nMarch\u2019 theme \u2013 you don\u2019t even have to hear all eighteen notes of that refrain to know that a big, bad, cyborg dude with a red lightsaber will be arriving shortly.\nIn writing the music for LOTR, Shore endeavoured\nto focus on narrative to deliver emotion rather than the\nmood of the music itself, and his expert use of leitmotif\nis the thread that binds the massive thirteen hours of\nstory together. The Lord of the Rings is a fantasy epic,\nwith a plethora of distinct races each with their own\nlanguage, culture, and home \u2013 creations representing\nover thirty years of Tolkien\u2019s life. These cultures themselves are a mixture of invented ideas and influences\nfrom real cultures. All of this is represented in the individual themes that Shore writes for each main charac-ter, which themselves are formed from patterns present\nin the themes of their own culture. The music written\nfor the hobbits borrows largely from Celtic influences,\nusingconnotativeinstrumentslikefiddlesandtinwhis-tles. There is a more lively, cheerful version of the Shire\ntheme that is only heard in the Shire itself, and a more\nwistful, pensive version used for moments of reminis-cence.Themusicoftheelvesisregal,elegant,andmean-dering \u2013 following the forms of their architecture, and\ntheir immortal lives. It uses clear toned female choirs\nand its melodies often borrow from the Phrygian mode\n(acollectionofrelatednotescommoninAncientGreek\nmusic) to emphasise its ancient and foreign qualities in\ncomparison to the younger cultures of Middle Earth.\nThere are over a hundred distinct themes in the\nscore overall, and as much as I\u2019d like to, discussing\nthem all here isn\u2019t practical. But it\u2019s also the way in\nwhich the themes are used that makes Shore\u2019s work\nso special in the context of film. A good example is\n\u2018The Fellowship of the Ring\u2019, the main theme for the\nfellowship itself. This is a sweeping, orchestral, and\nheroic piece that frequently soars through the mix in\nthe first film. After Gandalf\u2019s death however, and the\nbreaking of the fellowship thereafter, the theme is only\nheard rarely and in fractured parts, woven into the\nthemes of the separate characters. Towards the end of\nthe final film, when the remaining members of the fellowship rally and charge towards the Black Gate, the\ntheme returns in style, this time sung by a full choir.\nShore\u2019s work is possibly the best demonstration in\nhistory of how the music of a film can be used to elevate\nthe narrative, and how important it is to the viewing\nexperience. There\u2019s a lot more that could be said, and\nI wish I had the music theory knowledge to do it. But,\nhonestly, it\u2019s just really, really, good. If I ever stop getting goosebumps at the charge of the Rohirrim in the\nBattle of the Pelennor fields, somebody euthanise me.\nOver its ever-so recognizable theme tune, the\nwords \u2018A Grand Day Out\u2019 are spelled out\nagainst the backdrop of a living room wallpaper, faded beige, patterned with little red flowers. Decorating the scene, a vintage camera hanging by its strap, a\nred and white beach chair, and a framed illustration\nof some swiss cheese. The camera then proceeds to\npan across a variety of holiday magazines sprawled\nacross the floor, a spinning globe and finally a familiar hand holding \u2018Picnic Guide\u2019, before finally introducing our main characters, Wallace and Gromit, lazily relaxing in their sofas on a quiet English evening.\nFor those of us already familiar with\nthe series, perhaps through repeat\nwatchings when we were young,\nthese few seconds will be like\nrevisiting an old friend, full of\ncharm and nostalgia, not requiring any lengthy reintroduc-tion. But it would be dismissive\nto cast all the qualities of this little gem as products\nof sentimentality. Rewatching this now, it is so evident the craft and creative talent that must have gone\ninto making this film. A Grand Day Out was made\nby Nick Park (with Aardman Animations) in 1989\nas his graduation project, using stop motion clayma-tion. The animation here so meticulous and beautifully human, the fingerprints on the character models\nstill visible, the sweeping landscapes shining pristine.\nWith a short runtime of 23 minutes, A Grand Day\nOut keeps things simple. Three characters, of which\nonly one can talk (voiced by Peter Sallis), and a tale as\nancient as time: Wallace and Gromit have run out of\ncheese to have with their crackers, so go to the moon to\ngetsome.Withthedialoguenecessarilybeingquitethin\n(itdoestaketwototango,afterall),alotisdoneinstead\nthrough visual storytelling and the combination of\nsoundtrack and sound effects. Following the tradition\nof the silent movies of the 1920s, a lot of jokes inevita-blyendupbeingtoldthroughslapstick,and,childishas\nthesejokesmaybe,itishardnottogetwonoverbythem.\nThe third character, a dormant robot (a police\nrobot of sorts) on the moon, is likely the most emotive\ncharacter here. When activated by Wallace, through\na ten pence coin, it cleans up after their mess, even issuing the rocket a parking ticket. As the robot looks\nthrough Wallace\u2019s picnic basket and finds a skiing mag-azine, we learn that the robot yearns to be on Earth,\nskiing away. In spite of its efforts to hijack the rocket\nto get to Earth, Wallace and Gromit jet off without it,\nleaving the robot back where it began, all alone, dispirited by its unrealised dreams. That of course is not the\nend of the robot\u2019s story, but I will not spoil any more.\nA Grand Day Out\nFilm Review\nHahyun Lee Environment Editor\nImage credit: Aardman Animations\nDirectedby: Nick Park\nStarring: Wallace, Gromit, Robot\nYear: 1989\nA practical guide on what to do if you run out of cheese.\n\n"

Allergies were invented by the British Empire to further their agenda of colonisation and white\nsupremacy.

They\nbegan teaching children that a superior, civilised,\nwhite human would have a visceral repulsion to these\n\u2018barbaric\u2019 substances, such as violent sneezes or puffy\nfaces. In fact, the allergic sneeze reaction is an allegory for the sexual violence of imperialism.

When she arrived at the\noffices, what she had previously assumed to be a pile\nof rubbish was in fact a cobweb shrouded picket line,\nmade up exclusively of people called Tom.\nTom, the head of the Imperial College Union Workers\nUnion (UWU), told NegaFelix \u201cWe have been sitting\nhere for six years now not letting anyone into the\noffice hoping that when the Union ceases to function,\npeople will acknowledge how vital the services we offer\nare and that we deserve a pay rise\u201d.\nThe conflict appears to have begun as a wage dispute\nthat dragged on after UWU employees appealed to\nrepresentatives of the student body to discuss a\npay rise.
