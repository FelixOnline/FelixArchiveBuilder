He had black\nwrinkled skin, draped about his misshapen\nbody like an ill-fitting overcoat. His eyes\nwere the size of soup plates, from which\npoured a waterfall of tears down through the\ngreat creases in his skin, forming a muddy\npool, in which he sat, sobbing sonorous ly. \"Don't tell me,\" said Ferocious, \"you,\nhuge sir, are the Tiny Twigworm.\"\n\"Yes,\" cried the Twigworm, \"and nobody loves me, and nobody wants me, and\nt'm lost and homeless, and . . . boo hoo\nhoo.\" He sobbed quietly, the ground trembling slightly at each sob.\nPhosphorous was genuinely moved.\n\"Please stop crying,\" he pleaded, \"Fero-cio us and I are here to help you. We'll find\nyour Twigwormery and take you home.\"\n\"Speak for yourself, dear boy,\" muttered\nFerocious under his breath. But the Twigworm had not heard him.\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" he shouted,\nsniffing violently, and causing a small sand-storm. \"You are true friends!\" He leapt forward to embrace Phosphorous. Luckily the\nnimble Jobrot jumped aside, just in time to\navoid being crushed to death.\n\"Hold it,\" shouted Ferocious, \" As you are\nour Adventure, so to speak, dear vast old\nperson, we will try to get you back to your\nhome. However,\" he held up his hand to\nstop the Twigworm, who was about to clasp\nhim in its arms, \"there will be the minimum\nof bodily contact. Do not even try to shake\nmy hand, O.K.?\" \"Oh, certainly,\" said the Twigworm, \"I 'll\ntry and remember, but I'm afraid I'm rather\nclumsy. Down at the Permanent Adventure\nReception Centre I did break rather a lot of\nthings.\"\n\"Well, there's not much you can break\nout here,\" said Ferocious, \"except Phosphorous and me. Just avoid treading on us and\neverything will be all right.\nSo Phosphorous and Ferocious stood clear\nwhile the Twigworm got to his feet, and the\nthree of them set off along the beach. Ferocious went first, striding along, Phosphorous\ntrotted behind him, and the Twigworm\nstumbled along on its great rubbery legs in\nthe rear.\nTime passed, and Phosphorous, who had\nstopped to examine an interesting shell,\ndropped behind. He was just starting to run\nto catch up, when two strange figures stepped out from behind a palm tree and accosted him.\n'Hey, sonny,\" said the first, \"You wanna\nearn a cool buck?\"\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Phosphorous,\nstaring in amazement at the creatures in\nfront of him. The larger of the two wore a belted trench coat, had a huge broken nose,\nand a scar on his cheek. A tiny moustache\ndecorated his upper lip. His companion was\neven shorter than Phosphorous, and apparently covered in short brown fur all over\u2014\nor at least on the bits that protruded from\nhis tiny trench coat. He wore a huge tr il by from beneath which stuck out a pointed\nnose, and a magnificent set of bristling\nwhiskers.\n'Don't play funny with me> kid,\" said the\nfirst one, \"This here is the undeniably nasty\nJoe (Whiskers) Stoat, and I have the honour to be the much-hated Dino (Washing-machine) Confetti. So there.\"\n\"Yeah, man,\" said Whiskers.\n\"What do you want?\" asked Pohophorous, a little shakily.\n\"Don't crowd me none, kid,\" said Dino,\n\"me and Whiskers got a proposition for\nyou. We works for Luigi Rabbit, maybe you\nheard of him, and he needs a bright lad\ntike you for his Incredible Floating Device.\nWhaddya say, kid?\"\n\"Yea, wh addy a say kid?\" said Whiskers.\n\"Well, it's awfully nice of you to ask\nme,\" answered Phosphorous, \"but you don't even know me, and actually I am on an\nadventure, so I'm afraid I 'll have to say no.\"\n\" Kid,\" said Dino, \"No-one says no to\nLuigi Rabbit\u2014least ways not if they want\nto stay healthy. You'se coming with us\nwhether you'se likes it or not.\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Whiskers, pulling a huge\ncarrot from the pocket of his trench coat.\n\"You stupid rodent,\" shouted Dino,\n\"what's that supposed to be; you gonna\npoison him if he makes a run for it, ha?\"\n\"Sorry, Dino, dat's my lunch.\"\n'Mamma mia, they send this idiot on an\nimportant job like this. Where's your gat,\nyou daft furry thing?\"\n\"I musta left it in the canteen, Dino.\"\n\"You want anything done, you gotta do\nit yourself.\" So saying Dino extracted a pistol from under his left armpit and\nwaved it at poor Phosphorous. \"O.K. kid,\nlet's get moving.\"\nPhosphorous had no choice really, so\nraising his hands above his head, he set\noff in the direction indicated by Dino's pointing gun. They had not gone very far before\nDino let out a shout.\n\"O.K. kid, stop right there.\" Phosphorous\nstopped right there. They had come to a halt by one of the larger palm trees. Dino\nreached forward and knocked three times\non the trunk. Nothing happened.\n\"Drat!\" said Dino. He knocked again.\nStill nothing happened. \"Whadda these guys\nthink they're playing at?\" he demanded.\nHe lean t his face close to the tree and\nshouted, \"Open this dor, you dim bo. It's me Dino Confetti, I gotta important guest\nfor Luigi.\n\"Yeah?\" said the tree, un believing ly, \"How do I know you're not an encyclopedia\nsalesman?\" Dino turned slowly purple.\n\"You dumb tree!\" he shouted, \"do I sound like an encyclopedia salesman? You\nopen this door immediately, or I 'll have you\npruned, you mouldy old plant.\"\n\"Dino,\" said the tree, \"you have just\nidentified yourself. Do come in.\"\nAs the arbor i al tones died away, a section of the trunk swung inwards to reveal\nan iron gate.\n\"Call the lift!\" ordered Dino.\n\"O.K.\" said Whiskers, \"LIFT!\" he shout-ed, \"here lift, nice lift, come to Whiskers.\"\nDino's huge fists clenched spasmodically.\n\"Push the button you hairy hedge-cr eat ure, do I have to do everything myself?\"\n\"Sorry, Dino,\" apologised Whiskers, and\npushed the button. There was a faint humming deep within the roots of the tree, and\nwith a slight clatter the lift arrived. The\nthree of them squeezed in and the lift began\nto drop. With it dropped Phosphorous'\nspirits. He was becoming distinctly worried.\n\"Where was he going? Where were Ferocious and the Twigworm? Who was Luigi\nRabbit? Don't miss next week's exciting\ninstalment,\" he thought; missing next\nweek's exciting instalment was fairly high\non his list of priorities.\nAs he worried and pondered, the lift\ncame to rest.\n\"Out you get, kid,\" said Dino. Ahead of\nPhosphorous lay a long curving tunnel, lit\nby candles, and smelling of damp earth.\nThe trio began to walk along the tunnel.\nEvery now and again a side tunnel branched\noff, but they kept to the main passage.\nPhosphorous felt that they had been walking for an age, when they rounded a corner and were confronted with a set of huge\nwooden doors. On a brass plate, in the\nmiddle of one door, was written \"L. Rabbit\n\u2014Boss.\"\n\"Here we are, kid,\" whispered Dino,\n\"now you act real respectful to Luigi and\nyou'll be O.K.\" He raised a fist and knocked\npolitely on the door.\n\"Enter,\" came a muffled voice from inside.\nThe doors swung open and Phosphorous\nwalked in.\n\"Oh, hello, how are YOU?\" asked Luigi\nRabbit.\nLuigi was not tall, even for a rabbit, and\nwore a beautiful scarlet smoking jacket.\nFrom between his two enormous front teeth\nprotruded an ivory cigarette-holder from\nwhich a tiny menthol cigarette was producing delicate puffs of blue smoke.\n\"Do come in, de a rie,\" he smiled, \"so\nyou're the lad that's going to work my\ndivine Incredible Floating Device.\"\n\"Well, actually\u2014no,\" said Phosphorous\nbravely, \"you see I'm on an adventure, with\nmy friend Ferocious Din, so I don't really\nhave the time.\"\n\"Oh, tut, tut,\" squeaked the Rabbit,\n\"there's no question of that, dear, you're\nworking for me now and no mistake. You\nwouldn't like me to hand you over to Dino,\nwould you? He's awfully rough when he's cross.\n\"Oh dear,\" said Phosphorous, \"I don't really know what to do.\"\n\"Just too tle along with Dino, sweetie,\"\nsaid Luigi, \"and get in the Device, like a good boy. Take him away with you, Dino,\nit's time for my little rest.\"\n\"O.K. boss\" growled Dino, \"Come on\nkid, let's go.\" So they went. Phosphorous\nand Dino (Washing-Machine) Confetti, with\nJoe (Whiskers) Stoat scuttling along be-hind, brandishing his carrot.\nThe floor of the tunnel began to tilt up-wards.\n\"At least we're getting back towards the\nsurface,\" thought Phosphorous. He would\nbe glad to get out into the fresh air, after\nwandering around in this dank rabbit war-ren. Suddenly the tunnel came to an end.\nAn iron ladder led up the earth wall to.a trapdoor. Dino went first, and heaved open\nthe trap door. A grey light brightened the\ntunnel, hurting Phosphorous' eyes for a mo-ment. He went up the ladder and out\nthrough the trap door. He seemed to be in\nsome kind of tent, the smell of soggy canvas was everywhere, and there was a great\ndeal of mud under foot.\nTaking up most of the space in the tent\nwas a large and complicated piece of mach-i nery. It was mostly constructed of polished\nbrass tubing, with great megaphone-like pro-tuber ances. It hummed quietly, and an occasional blue spark would jump, with a crack\nbetween the polished domes which surmounted the Device. A little old man\ncrouched at the back of the machine, squirting oil onto a silently spinning wheel. He\nlooked up, wiped his hands on a piece of\noily rag, and came across to where Dino,\nPhosphorous and Whiskers were standing.\n\"Good day to ye,\" he said, \"I'm Haggis\nMacPlumbing, the engineer here\u2014is this the\nnew laddie?\"\n\"Yeah, he's all yours,\" said Dino, \"We\ngotta be going now,\" he turned to Phosphorous, \"You behave yourself, kid and\nyou'll be O.K.\" He and the little Stoat\nopened the trap door in the floor, and with\na last wave to Phosphorous disappeared out\nof sight.\n\"Thank goodness they've gone,\" said\nHaggis, \"Id inna rate that Dino laddie at\nall. Have ye had any experience of this kind\no' thing?\"\n\"What kind of thing?\" asked Phosphorous.\n\"Why floating, laddie,\" replied the old\nengineer.\n\"Only in the bath, I suppose,' 'said Phosphorous.\n\"Och, ye'll take to it in nae time, d inna ye worry. In ye get\".\n\"Look\" protested Phosphorous, \"nobody\nwill listen to me. I can't get in your rotten\nmachine\u2014I have to go and look for my\nfriend Ferocious Din and the Tiny Twigworm. I just don't have the time.\" The old\nman was obviously moved.\n\"I appreciate your position,\" he said, \"but\nit's more than ma job's worth tae let ye go.\nLook, just get in the machine for a wee\nwhile and I 'll have a word wie that weird\nrabbit, and see what I can do.\" Phosphorous was getting tired of arguing.\n\"Alright,\" he said, \"but just for a little\nwhile.\"\nFocus, along with the Mahavishnu .\nOrchestra are for me the most exciting\nand original band to emerge this year\nfrom a stale and unimaginative rock\nscene. It is not surprising that they are\nfrom outside the established AngloAmerican dominated rock culture. For\nthe uninitiated, Focus are a four-piece\nfrom Amsterdam formed in '69 by\nThijs Van Leer, their organist and fl aut ist. All come from a good musical back-ground, Van Leer having taken up\nmusic at the tender age of three and\nhaving been awarded a degree on flute\nat Geneva Conservatoire. Jan Akkerman\nstudied guitar at Amsterdam Music\nLyceum for five years and Pierre Van\nDer Linden was taught for seven years\nby various top orchestral percussionists.\nBert Ruiter is the only member of the\nband that has not received classical\ntraining.\nThe only regret I have about their\nthird album is that it is not a live re-cording. Having had the pleasure of seeing Focus four times I think that a lot\nof their excitement is lost on a studio\nalbum. Still, perhaps the next one will\nbe live.\nThe most commercial track on the\nWell folks, that was the last concert\nat I.C. for 1972, and if you didn't see\nit you should kick yourselves. The\nKinks always have been a very polished\ngroup, and to go with their music, they\nproduced the best stage act I 've seen\nsince Brewers Droop, quite some time\nago. Ray Davies captured the audience\nwith his loose approach to the show, demanding applause for everybody and\neverything else on stage (including his\njacket). There were also some nice flourishes produced by the 3-piece brass sec-tion, led by Mike Cotton.\nInevitably they played several of their\ngolden oldies since their first hit over\n8 years ago, including \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\", \"Till the End of the\nDay\", \"Sunny Afternoon\" and \"Water-MacPlumbing led him towards the mach-ine.\n\"Stand between these terminals, laddie,\"\nhe urged, \"and I 'll turn up the field.\"\nPhosphorous stood where he was shown\nand old Haggis disappeared round the back\nof the Device. The hum of the machine rose,\nand Phosphorous felt a strange tickling sensation in the soles of his feet. He looked\ndown. He was floating about ten feet .off\nthe floor of the tent.\n\"Oooooh!\" he said.\n\"Och, lovely,\" cackled the old man, \"It's going like a dream, laddie, the new main\nsensors are running something beautiful.\"\nPhosphorous was still too stunned to say\nanything. He drew a couple of deep\nbreaths, and thought hard of dentists\u2014a technique he had used often in the past to\ntake his mind off things.\nSlowly he looked about, and took stock\nof the situation. He began to experiment.\nAlthough he could go neither up nor dow rT, he found he could move from side to side\nby waving his arms and legs.\n\"Dinna do that, ye daft sporran,\" shouted\nMacPlumbing, \"Ye'll get outside the field\nand break a leg.\" Phosphorous stopped\nwriggling. Just floating was not an unpleasant sensation, rather like being immersed in thick spongy mud\u2014not that\nPhosphorous had ever been immersed in\nthick, spongy mud. As the Jobrot was beginning to relax and enjoy himself, he saw\nHaggis MacPlumbing making for the door.\n\"Hey, where are you going,\" he shouted.\n\"Just popping out for a while,\" answered\nthe old engineer, craftily, \"I 'll be back in no\ntime at all.\" And he was gone. Phosphorous\nwas a trusting sort of person, but he had a distinct feeling that he was being duped.\nOn the beach Ferocious had finally\nnoticed his friend's absence.\n\"Where has that do zy twit got to?\" he\ndemanded.\n\"Well, you were going rather fast,\" suggested the Twigworm,\" perhaps he just got\nleft behind.\"\n\"Possibly, dear old hugeness,\" mused\nDin, \"but I surmise unlikely. The lad was,\nshall we say, fired with enthusiasm for this\nConf. p.9. double album is 'Sylvia' which surprisingly enough doesn't open the album. It\nis common practice to open an album\nwith the most striking track on it. (Re-member 'Moving Waves'). 'Sylvia' begins with a heavy repetitive chord sequence which then makes way for some\nvery melodic guitar creating a mood of\nfloating serenity that is a key to much of\ntheir work. There is peace and tranquillity too in 'Carnival Fugue', Van Leer's showpiece which finishes off side one.\nThis starts as a Bach-style fugue with\nVan Leer on piano and develops a Latin-American flavour, Van Leer playing piccolo and organ. Side Two is devoted to 'Focus III' and 'Answers?\nQuestions! Questions? Answers!' The\nlatter features some imaginative guitar\nfrom Akkerman.\n'Anonymous II' takes up the whole of\nSide Three and spills over into Side\nFour. This track is the best on the\nalbum. It features an excellent bass solo\nand more superb lead. The album finishes with 'Elspeth of Nottingham' which\ngives Jan a chance to play some Elizabethan lute music and 'House of the\nKing', a favourite from the first album.\nThis is rock at its best.\nloo Lily\" as well as their not so old\nmaterial such as \"Apeman\", which was\ndeliberately taken much too fast, and\n\"Lola\", in which Ray Davies had little\ntrouble in inducing audience part ic ipa tion. During \"Alcohol\" he emptied the\nremains of his beer mugs, which were in\nconstant use throughout the set, into the\nfront rows, though no-one seemed to\nmind, and for the last two, \"You Really\nGot Me\" and \"All Day and All of the\nNight\", most people took their seats,\nfrom the chairs and floor provided, as\nthe band pounded away to Ray's sing-ing. On its completion he dashed from\nthe stage to escape from several maidens\nwanting to kiss their hero.

Andy O 'Brien, Electrical Engineering messenger said that both the\nworkers and the students\nmust support the struggle\nagainst this happening,\nand said that NUPE staff\nother than cleaners were\nprepared to take industrial ar\u00bbion should the College proceed with this\nplan.\nIt was explained that\nthe College, through its\nDomestic Bursar, Mr.\nCarl Seaford, was putting\nforward the plan to reduce cleaning staff in an\nattempt to maintain the\nprofit ratio on Halls of\nResidence, and to keep\nrents down. Andy O 'Brien\nsaid that the College\nclaimed that wages took\n67 per cent of total hall re-venue; the college would\nprefer them to only take\n33 per cent like the student houses in Evelyn\nGardens. He pointed out\nthat the standard of cleaning was also correspondingly different, and asked\nthe meeting whether it\nthought it preferable that\nthe cleanliness of halls be\nreduced.\nHe and Ron Parker,\nBeit messenger, stressed\nthe importance of a joint\nworkers and students\nstruggle.\n(More detailed discussion of the problem appears in CEFE's \"Opin-ion\" column on page 9 of\nthis issue).\nBefore this, the meeting\nhad listened to a speech\nby Brian Grogan.\nMr. Grogan concentrated his talk on the \"Crisis\nof Capitalism\" in view of\n\"the falling profits since\n1962\". He said that this\ncrisis had thrown the rul-.\ning class into confusion,\nand they were trying to\nre-unite themselves, both\nTory and Labour Party\ncapitalists, through the\nwage freeze. Citing what\nhe called an attempt to\nde moral is e the working\nclass through the unemployment problem, he\nsaid that the working class\nhad never been more united and more self-conf id ent \u2014 the reverse of what\nthe government wanted\nhad happened.\nIn his view, the only\nway to get rid of the wage\nSUMMER JOBS IN THE SUN?\nWhy not work in the West\nCountry next summer? Send\ns.a.e. for full details of jobs\navailable. Tression Ltd.,\nTredrea Inn, Porthcothan\nBay, Padstow, Cornwall.\nare still in this strong and\nunited position.\nHe went on to a detailed discussion of the\nrelative policies of the\nCommunist Party, and the\n-International Marxist Group on the overthrow\nof capitalism. An International Marxist himself,\nhe attacked the CP's s it y was the defeat of\nthe Tories. He was also\nadamant that a campaign\nfor \"Labour Government\ncommitted to Socialist\npolicies\" as put forward\nby workers press was totally useless. His lengthy\ndiscourse on the latter\ndegenerated into a fierce\ndialogue with a member\nof another faction.\nThe main message agreed upon at Thursday's meeting was that there should be a hall\nrents strike for higher grants and against cutbacks in cleaners' jobs.\nThe proposed rent strike would\ndemands:\nhave four\n1) \u00a3100 increase in the grant now\n2) No cut-back in cleaners' jobs.\n3) No rent increases\n4) The DES must pay for all future halls.\nThe subject of rent strikes will be taken to\nthe first U GM of next term, and the meeting\ncalled upon students not to pay their hall bills\nuntil then.\nWe have 900\nlone girls here\"\nThat's the message of a letter from the Hampstead\nGarden Suburb Institute asking for virile young men\nto attend their dance on Saturday, December 16. The\nprice is dirt cheap \u2014 30p \u2014 and in their words they\nwould \"be delighted to see as marry men as possible\".\nPaul Wadsworth, I.C.

STIRLING LATEST\nThe first student to appear before the discipline\ncommit tu; was found guilty of \"Conduct prejudicial to\nthe good order and interests of the University by obtaining entry to a reception at the MacRobert Centre\nwithout having been invited\".\nHe is appealing against the verdict.\nThe nature of the committee is best described by\nMr. George More, the Solicitor representing the stu-dents. He describes the committee as \"unbelievably\nbiased\". Furthermore Mr. More stated \"Every defence\nobjection was over-ruled, every prosecution objection\nwas upheld and I was not allowed to call all the witnesses whose evidence I thought would be relevant.\"\nThe cases are likely to go on for many weeks, perhaps months. 23 more students including 15 council\nmembers were charged and the authorities are demanding expulsions.\nCommunity Action Group\nCHRISTMAS\nAPPEAL\nWanted:\nOLD CLOTHES\n(and shoes and boots)\nJUMBLE\nTOYS\nfor:\nFOOD\n(tea, coffee, sugar, powdered milk, tinned\nfood, cigarettes, sweets, chocolate . . .)\nETC.\n(paper cups, books, blankets . . .)\nKIDS\nMarylands Adventure Playground in North Paddington was originally set up with\nfunds from an l.C.

We hope to provide them with\njumble, presents to be distributed by Father Christmas, and a soup stall.\nDOSSERS\nEach year the St. Mungo Community Trust holds a Christmas Party for the\nvagrants on the embankment.

Records cost such a fantastic amount that the\nstudent has difficulty in\naffording the prices that\nare charged for records.\nTo counteract this the\nSounds Service in IC is\nbeing operated so that students may buy records at\n10\u201415 per cent off the\nrecommended retail price.\nThis means that a record\nthat normally sells for\n\u00a32.30 costs the student\n\u00a31.91 and \u00a32.50 records\ncost \u00a32.05.\nTo take advantage of\nthis great cost-cutting ser-vice, just drop in and see\nColin McCall or one of\nthe other people on the\nSounds Service stall in the\nJ. C.R., College Block,\nduring lunch break on\nTuesday, Thursday, or\nFriday every week until\nthe Union Room-at-the top is ready.\nOrders may also be forwarded through the internal mail to Colin MoCall,\nELEC, ENG 2 . . .\nThe records are ordered\nfrom a supplier of records to most of the universities and colleges in\nthe Home Counties, who\ncollates all his orders and\nbuys the records to order\nfrom a record dealer. In\nthis way, the records are\npurchased new and in better condition than one receives them from most record stores, at much less\nthan the full retail price.\nThere is no middle-man\nmaking a fortune out of\nthe record-buying public,\njust a group of students\nwho want to enable their\nfellow students to listen to\nthe music of their own\nchoice with the minimum\nof cost.\n1\n-1 ike-fruit-fresh felix-on-december-12-a tuesday-as-always-was-edited-by-Oliverdowson.

If there was a plot (or even vague direction of pur-pose), it is that the first named set of\npeople come together and \"behave\" in\nfront of the \"Audience\". Two of the\n\"Cast\" never appear on stage, but are\nplanted in the \"Audience\", and if\nthey were there to act as a catalyst\nfor audience reaction, they failed mis-era bly.

I thought it outstanding. Then came\n\"Canterbury Tales\", \"Company\" and\n\"Fiddler on the Roof\". I considered\nthem outstanding as well. After pinning that same label on another half\ndozen, I concluded \"outstanding\" was\nin fact the adjective for West End\ntheatre. \"Day after the Fair\" does not\nmeet this standard.\nThe play centres in a 'nineties drawing room, where a wealthy brewer\n(Duncan Lamont) is immersed in business affairs \u2014 trying to ruin his rival.\nHis wife of three years, Edith (Deborah\nKerr) was a peasant who he made a lady. Having no children, he brings a girl from her village, Anna (Julia Foster) to be her servant, and is busily\nmaking a lady of her.\nA fair comes to town where Anna\nmeets Charles (Paul Hastings), a London barrister in town for the day.\nNext day, - conveniently Anna's afternoon off, they spend the afternoon in\na sheltered glade, culminating their\nnew-found friendship in the manner\none might well imagine.\nA week later, a letter arrives from\nLondon; alas, being able to neither read\nnor write, Anna cannot comprehend\nits contents.

Although the\nsister-in-law, Netty (Avice Landon)\nthinks there's more than beer a brew-ing, 4he fails to make her brother\nunderstand. He seems blithely un cons it ion of pornographic film descriptions\nand bouts of interspersed Romantic\nPoetry. But these points shine despite,\nand not because of, the general con-tent.\nSo what was it (writes he rhetorically)?\n\"You're just a Device!\" shouted one of\nthe cast at one of the audience im-plante es.

Despite\nhis attitude many of the students in hall have heard\nrumours about the hall fees being raised, and the\ncleaners have heard rumours of sacking s. This is the\nway the College authorities would like it at the\nmoment, with these rumours spreading and without\nanyone stepping back and taking an overall view. So\nwhat better place tHan the \"Opinion\" column in\n\"Felix\" to start some clear discussion on the matter.\nWhat is the problem?\nAt the moment the College authorities want to\nkeep the same level of\nsurplus from hall fees;\nthis is being used to keep\na profit to finance the\nbuilding of new halls.\nThere are two ways open\nto them to do this, as\nthey look at it; these are\nto raise hall fees or to\ncut costs. The problem\narises when we see that\nthe students do not want\nhall fees to go up and\nthe workers do not want\nto lose their jobs as part\nof the cost cutting.\nWhat is happening now?\nThe rumours are\nspreading, and both\ngroups of people directly\naffected by this are discussing ways in which\nthey can minimise the\neffects to themselves.\nThe college authorities\nwould like nothing better\nthan to see the students\nand workers at odds over\nthis issue, each suggesting that the alternative\nwhich affects the others\nworst is the one the authorities should adopt.\nThe college authorities\nwould then step in and\nsuggest that both \"sides\"\nshould compromise. They\nwould like to see a few\nless workers and only a small rise in the fees.\nThey would then claim\nthat all were happy because a \"reasonable so lu tion\" had been arrived\nat. But in that case some\nworkers would have lost\njobs and students would\nbe paying more. It would\nbe only the college authorities that would be in\nany way happy. The only\nreason that workers and\nstudents might accept this\nis that there is no other\nalternative. The \" College\nauthorities are now actively trying to put the\nsituation to students as a straight choice.\nIs there any alternative?\nThere is. This involves\nboth students and workers identifying who are\ngoing to be worse off\nafter this and who would\ngain. Then to form a strong worker-student alliance so that students\nand workers fight on the\nsame side.\nThen we would fight\nfrom a position of\nstrength with no internal\ndivisions. Fight to keep\nhall fees the same. Fight\nto keep all the jobs there\nare at present. Fight to\nget the Department of\nEducation and Science\n(through the University\nGrants Committee) to pay\nfor all future hall build-ing.\nWe must at no time be\nput off by a statement\nfrom college authorities\nthat \"there would be no\nredundancies\". They still\nhave a system of natural\nwastage where the jobs\nof all cleaners who leave,\nfor any reason, are not\noffered for replacements.\nIn a type of work with a fairly rapid turnover of\nlabour this would allow\nthe authorities to reduce\nthe staff just as they like.-We must fight to get the\nauthorities to keep the\nsame overall number of\njobs.\nIt is absolutely essential that this is discussed\nby students and workers\nnow so that all the alternatives can be looked at.\nThis will avoid the situation which Mr. Seaford\nwould seem to like, when\nhe could bring a fait ac-comp li,a simple choice,\nhigher hall fees or less\nworkers.\nStudents and workers\nmust not be forced to\ntake any responsibility\nfor the running of the university under the present\ncapitalist system. It is\nneither the students nor\nthe workers who are going\nto benefit from it. The\nlarge monopolies and important industries who do\nbenefit is where the\nmoney must come from.\nWe must decide now to\nstop any action that is\ngoing to be detrimental\nto either workers or stu-dents. This present\nscheme would be detrimental to both. So we\nmust act as soon as possible to stop its implementation. Christmas Fast\nf ot*\nWorld Justice\nsupported by World Development Movement, Third\nWorld First, Oxfam, War on Want, etc.\nThis is a Nationwide Protest against the shameful\ngulf that divides the \"rich world\" and \"poor world\".\nWhether you guzzle or\nglorify or both at Christmas, it seems an appropriate time to bring home\nthe urgency of the problem of world poverty and\npoint out that it can be\ntackled.\nNo one really wants\nanother person to starve\nbut most people seem to\nbelieve that with the\namount of help Britain\ngives, the poor nations\nshould now be able to\nfind their own solutions.\nHowever, most development economists realize\nthat the trade and investment policies of the\nrich countries and big\ncompanies exploit the\npoor; that what we take\naway in profits and\npower from the Third\nWorld outweighs whatever real value our aid\nhas: and that the poor\nstay poor because they\ncannot force concessions\nas they have no power.\nThis fast is a step towards creating the necessary understanding and\ndetermination to make\nthe injustice of world\npoverty a live public is-sue.\nFasts are being held in\n28 different places throughout Britain and\nin London alone there\nwill be five centres. Most\nfasts fall between December 21 and December 25\nwith a24 hour minimum\nfasting period. During\nthis time tasters will be\nleafleting, question n airing and public ising through\nthe media of street\ntheatres, workshops and\nfilms with the aim of\ngenerating widespread interest and sympathy to\nour point of view.\nFasts aren't new, but\nthis is the first time that\nthe determination, enthusiasm and concern which\nexists over this issue in\nmany people throughout\nthe country will have been\ngathered up in a concerted demonstration of\ncommitment and as such\nshould make a significant\nimpact.

The area decided upon was the CORDILLERA REAL, a spectacular mountain\nrange, forming part of\nthe Andean chain in N.E. Bolivia.\nThe situation of this\nrange is very interesting\nas they form part of the\nboundary between the\nALTIPLANO on the\neast, a high plain of over\n12,000 feet, and then on\nthe west the ground\nslopes away massively\nproportioned, heavily\nwooded valleys to the\nAmazon basin. It is on\nthe alt i plano that the\nInca and pre-Inca cultures\nflourished; on Lake Titiana, the large inland\nlake on the plain, reed\nboats of the Ra 2 type\nare still used by the\nIndians for fishing, and\nit is here that the Indian\nwomen all wear bowler\nhats. In the valleys of the\nmountains Indians also\nlive at altitudes up to\n16,000 feet; they have to\nadapt specially to the\nlack of oxygen and the\nintense cold at night. This\nis the region of the llama\nand the condor. Beyond\nthese valleys are the\nsnow - capped peaks\nstretching up to 22,000\nfeet, as spectacular as\nhigh mountains always\nare.\nIt is against this background that the account\nof the expedition is set;\nthe journey across Peru,\nthe living in La Paz, a dust bowl scooped out\nof the alt i plano, waiting\nfor equipment Jo arrive,\nthe journey across the\nplain, up through the\nhigh valleys, and then,\nusing llamas jand local\nporters, to base camp.\nThere was then a period\nof climbing, an accident\nin which two of the party\nwere killed, and our rescue attempt, and finally\nthe return, bringing us\neventually back to London.\nThe,lecture, which will\nbe fully illustrated with\nslides, is tonight (Tues-day) at 7.30 in Room\n303, RSM.\nContinued from page 10\nadventure. I expected him to be trotting on\nahead not disappearing in the rear.\n\"Oh, dear,. I do hope he's all right,\" said\nthe Twigworm, \"I mean you've both been\nso good to me and everything. This is all\nmy fault really, oh, I am sorry, I don't know\nwhat to say . . .\" He began to cry.\n\"Let's not start that again,\" pleaded\nFerocious, \"It's not your jolly old fault, it's just typical Phosphorous. He cannot keep\nhis mind on one thing for more than ten\nminutes at a stretch. The dear boy will no\ndoubt re-emerge in the near future. I suggest we\u2014ah\u2014press on, so to speak, and\nhope for the best.\"\n\"Well, if you think it's all right,\" said\nthe Twigworm, \"he is your friend, I sup-pose.\"\n\"We all have our crosses to bear,\" said\nFerocious, and they trudged on along the\nbeach. They had not gone very far, when\nthe sound of music and laughter could be\nheard, coming down the wind.\n\"As a change from this endless beach,\"\nsaid Ferocious, \"I suggest we head for\nthese sounds of revelry.\" Reaching the top\nof a large dune they could see the source\nof the noise. Spread out beneath them was\na huge fair.\nGaily coloured tents covered an area the\nsize of Hyde Park, strange machines\nwhirled merry-makers up, down, round and\nthrough. Mechanical music filled the air,\nlights throbbed, whistles shrieked, men\nshouted. It was very noisy indeed.\n\"Hum,\" said Ferocious.\n\"Oooooh!\" said the Twigworm.\n\"That looks quite adventurous, does Jt\nnot, dear lad?\" said Ferocious, \"let us\nmingle with the gay throng, and see what\noccurs.\"\nSo down the side of the dune went Ferocious Din and the Tiny Twigworm. They\nwandered amongst the tents and sideshows,\njostled by the crowds, pulled here and there\nby stall holders, all their senses assaulted at\nonce. Unfortunately they had only 10p between them so they were unable to go on\nany of the weird and exciting looking rides\nand sideshows.\n\"With 10p we can have one go each\non one thing,\" said Ferocious, \"what's it\ngoing to be?\" \"Oh, I couldn't possibly say,\" said the\nTwigworm, \"you decide for me.\"\n\" A difficult choice, so to speak,\" spoke\nFerocious, \"I think the best solution is for\nme to spin round with my eyes shut, and\nthen open them very suddenly. The attraction which first catches my eye will be the\none on which we will blow our tiny wealth.\"\nThe Twigworm did not seem to object, so-Ferocious shut his eyes and spun round on\none leg. He fell immediately to the ground.\nAs he opened his eyes to examine his\ninjuries, he found he had come to rest at\nthe foot of a large sign.\n\"CREATURE FROM BEYOND MARS\nDEFIES GRAVITY\" it read, \"Doctor Rabbit's amazing Invention defeats Laws of\nNature. See Space Being float on air. He\nlives, he breathes. See him today\u2014only 5pa look.\"\n\"Not perhaps my first choice,\" said Fer- .\no cio us, \"but in we go.\" They paid their 5p each to the little old man on the door and .\nstepped inside the tent.\n\"Hello Ferocious, Hello Twigworm,\" said\nPhosphorous the Jobrot.\n\n"

DCL have a monopoly of\nwhisky production \u2014 they make or market 95% of all\nthe whisky bought, including names such as Johnnie\nWalker, Black and White, Dewar's, Haig, etc. \u2014 and\nhave a large share of the rest of the spirits market. A full list of their spirits appears elsewhere in this issue\nof \"Felix\".\nBeer boycotted also\nAn amendment from\nthe floor, tabled by Oliver\nDowson, Felix Editor,\ncalled for the boycott to\nbe extended to the beers\nproduced by breweries in\nwhich DCL have interests,\nand was equally overwhelmingly passed. Another amendment called on\nthe College to order other\nproducts, such as liquid\ngas, that they buy at present from DCL comp an ies, from other sources.\nCollege obduracy\nJohn Lane, Union President, explained that it\nwas going to be more than\ndifficult to persuade the\nCollege to implement this,\nand told the meeting of\nthe reception Rob Armitage's proposal of a College boycott of DCL\nspirits had got at a recent\nRefectory Committee\nmeeting. The College is\napparently loath to do\nanything that might upset\nDCL, since they run scholarships and give other\naid to the college.\nA shortened version of\nan article, \"Why Boycott\nDistillers?\" by Jeff Staniforth (NUS Treasurer),\nappears on page ?? of this\nissue of \"Felix\". This article explains the reasons\nfor boycotting DCL _pro ducts.\nDelighted\nRob Armitage, explaining to \"Felix\" that the\nboycott would be a voluntary one, since the College would not ban DCL\nspirits from the bars, said\nthat he was \"delighted\"\nthat the motion had been\npassed. \"I had completely\nmisjudged the mood of\nthe meeting\" he said, and\nwent on to say that he\nwould have gone further\nhad he realised how easily\nthe motion got through.\nMost other college\nUnions throughout Britain have passed similar\nboycott motions, and, in\nmany places where the\nbars are controlled by the\nUnion, DCL products\nhave been completely\nbanned\". Here they are\nlikely to be marked with\na red star to make them\neasily distinguishable.\" \u2022\u00abWHY? TEN YEARS AGO Distillers Company Limited\nmarketed the drug Thalidomide to expectant mothers.\nOver 400 children were born with terrible handicaps.\nDCL denies negligence. No newspaper can discuss\nthat question, for fear of prosecution by DCL. The\nenormous power DCL has because of its wealth is an\neffective deterrent. It does not occur to DCL that its\nenormous wealth would be better employed helping\nThalidomide victims.\nLast year DCL made a profit of \u00a364 million. Their\nlatest increased offer to the parents is a lump sum of\n\u00a35 million \u2014 provided the parents sign away any rights\nagainst DCL in the future. The sum, when divided\namong all the children, gives each child about \u00a3200\nfor each year of its life.\nDCL can prevent us from discussing publically\nwhether or not it was negligent. But this much we can\nsay. DCL marketed the drug. DCL is huge and rich.\nThe company could easily afford \u00a320 million from its\nprofits, and that is all the parents are asking for.\nInstead DCL has decided to fight the parents. It has\nconsistently made the smallest offer it thinks it can\nget away with. It has used threats. It has splashed\nmoney around to subdue those people, few of them\nwealthy, whose lives have already been blasted by the\ndrug DCL marketed. Faced with human suffering,\nDCL has reacted with writs. Faced with deformed\nchildren, it has reacted with attacks. It has fought\nand wriggled for ten years to avoid parting with one\npenny more of its enormous profits than it can possibly\nhelp.\nAnd what about the children? For ten years parents\nhave fought for the future of children without arms,\nwithout legs, with brain malformations, with a host of\ncrippling deformities, and without hope. Those children are now reaching what may be the most difficult\nperiod of their lives: their adolescence, when they will\nbegin to grasp the full horror of what has been done to\nthem.\nThey will reach it without sympathy from Distillers\nCompany Limited.\nThe worst may be to come. It has been suggested\nthat, with their parents to look after them, thalidomide\nchildren will be all right on DCL's \u00a3200 a year. But\nwhat happens when these children reach the age of\n40\u2014when their parents may 'be dead, or no longer\nable to work to support them?\nThey will have no arms, no legs, and \u00a3200 a year\u2014\nif the money hasn't all gone by then.\nWhat can we do? You could have a whip round\nnow, and raise a little money to help them. But are\nthose children to rely on charity all their lives\u2014or\nought we to try and make DCL dip into its huge\nprofits for them?\nBut what can we do to force DCL?\nIf the pharmaceutical industry were owned by the\nstate, and responsible to the people, the violence of\npublic reaction would ensure a little humanity. But\nDCL is responsible to no one but itself.\nA huge, rich, powerful combine can get away with\nanything \u2014 even pinching pennies from deformed\nchildren to swell its already massive profits.\nBut if enough people act together, we can achieve\nsomething. In Germany, after eight years of legal wriggling, the company which marketed Thalidomide there\nagreed to pay its total profits for ten years into a trust\nfund for Thalidomide victims. So far, Distillers' best\noffer is about 8\n% of its profits for one year.\nThe usefulness of appealing to DCL's better feelings\nseems remote, and that is why the NUS Conference has\ngiven its support to a boycott of all DCL products. The\nonly way we can help the parents of these children to\nget a settlement which will be acceptable to them is\nto show DCL that we can make a real dent in its sacred\nprofits.\nBritain's New National\nAnthem( For Susan W.,a brave and beautiful girl)\nThey failed to sing \"The Queen\" one day\nIn Britain's old traditional way;\nInstead of Princes, Queens and Kings\nThe British thought of other things.\nThey wrote an Anthem new and bold,\nOutside the monarchist ic mould;\nThey set a plaintive human plea\nTo music in a minor key.\nThen all the country rose to stand,\nEach one with empty glass in hand,\nTo sing the Anthem far and wide\nAs women wept and strong men cried.\nWhat British Anthem now was heard\nWhich made the other less Preferred?\n\u2014\"God Save the Kids . . .\" they sang and\ncried\n\"Whose mothers took Thalidomide\".\n\u00a9 Nigel Racine-Jacques, 1972\nThis is not easy. \u00a364 million is an almost unassailable\nprofit margin, and on hearing about iN US's boycott,\nDCL's press office told reporters they had \"absolutely\nno comment\" to make. One can see why. They own\n80% of the whisky market for a start. It's not exactly\na monopoly, but if you refuse to buy DCL's whisky\nyou may find yourself going without whisky in a great\nmany pubs. And it's not as though drink is DCL's only interest. The list of the companies it owns occupies two long columns in \"Who Owns Whom\". It has\nits fingers in pretty well every pie or soft drink you\nare likely to buy. Its assets are enormous, its interests\nextensive, its tentacles everywhere. The power of this\nenormous combine, both to do harm and to resist\nattack, is enormous. \u201e\nOver the next few months we must make sure we\nfind every single way in which we can hit DCL where\nit will hurt most. And the best time to start is now \u2014\nwhen this soulless Leviathan is trying to make room in\nits vaults for the traditional bonanza it makes out\nof Christmas the season of good will.\nSpirits sell in enormous quantities at Christmas time.\nWe have a very few weeks in which to out as far as\npossible into the huge profits that Distillers are going\nto make\nSO\nBE CAREFUL WHAT SPDUTS YOU BUY\nFOR CHRISTMAS.\nDO NOT BUY any of these brands of whisky:\nVAT 69; Johnny Walker; King George TV; Old\nScotch; White Horse; Black and White; Dewars.\nDO NOT BUY any of these brands of Gin:\nGordons; Booths; High and Dry London; Tanqueray.\nAND DO NOT BUY\nCossack Vodka; Pimms No. 1.\n\n"

The problem of student accommodation is a contentious subject about which almost everyone in\nthe land is aware. Last month, the National Union\nof Students' conference at Margate involved itself\nin some pretty fiery discussion about it, and saw\nthemselves splashed in the headlines by passing\nresolutions to stage rent strikes and so forth.\nYes, almost everyone is aware of the problem,\nbut that is not to say that everyone can define\nit.\nWhat it really comes down to is a difficulty in\nfinding a reasonable place to live at a reasonable\nrent \u2014 a difficulty made almost an impossibility\nas long as student grants remain fixed and the\ncost of living and the level of rents continues to\nrise.\nIn short, what is glibly referred to as the problem of student accommodation, is the personal\nanguish of a student trying to stretch his meagre\nincome sufficiently to pay the rent.\nAnd there's little comfort for him in knowing\nthat the problem can only get worse. The enormous\npressure of more and more young people leaving\ntheir parents' homes and looking for a place of\ntheir own is already swamping the pool of available\naccommodation. The inevitable effect is that rents\nare rising and will continue to do to.\nThere is only one way to get off this weary\ntreadmill \u2014 and that is simply to build more places\nfor students to live.\nOf course, it's obvious.\nBut perhaps it's so obvious that we get blinded\nto the possibilities of simple solutions. Of course,\nthere are enormous difficulties involved, and even\nto think of them is enough to make most people\nshudder and dismiss the idea as beyond achieve-ment.\nBut is it really impossible?\nYou may remember that last month in this col-um n, FELIX FINANCIALLY's consultant DEREK E. CUMMINGS promised to put forward a solution,\nsuggesting what could be done, how it could be\ndone and by whom.\nThis is his blueprint for action.\nSo you're thinking of a rent strike.\nYou, and the National Union of Students to\nwhich you belong, have grown impatient with the\nsituation that rising costs have dropped you into,\nand you are going to express your frustration and\ndissatisfaction by organising a protest.\nAll right, you have every right to be unhappy and\nhave every right to protest about it.\nBut in my view you are wasting your time.\nA rent strike may well make a good headline. A protest march with banners flying may well make\ngood television pictures. But in the end, what are\nthey likely to achieve for you?\nI think very little.\nBecause whatever you do to draw attention to\nthe problem of student accommodation does not\nalter the fact that there isn't enough accommodation to go round and that such accommodation as is\navailable will get more and more expensive.\nJust analyse the problem as it exists at Imperial\nCollege, among four thousand students.\nTwelve hundred of you live in halls of residence.\nAnother thousand or more 'live either at home or\nin apartments which might Just suit your pockets.\nThat leaves, say, fifteen hundred of you with a problem.\nThis sort of arithmetic can be applied to any\nnumber of other universities and colleges throughout the land, but let's concentrate on Imperial College just now.\nWhat would be the ideal answer to the dilemma\nof those fifteen hundred of you who have a struggle\nto pay the rent and thereby to live in reasonable\ncomfort?\nIt is simply to build more halls of residence \u2014\nwouldn't you agree?\nNo, I am not out of my mind. I know it could be\ndone, and I know how it could be done.\nWhat is required is the money to build them, and\nthe land to build them on. I know where both exist.\nAnd I have a very good idea how they can be\nbrought together for the purpose of creating three\nor four purpose-built halls of residence for the students of Imperial College.\nA pipe dream? Not at all. I say again, it can be\ndone.\nFirst, let's consider the land?\nThere are, between Imperial College and London\nAirport, vast chunks of land owned by the Greater\nLondon Council. Some of it has no kind of planning permission for any kind of development, some\nhas permission for the building of homes and some\nof it is designated for industrial purposes.\nLand which has planning permission for dwelling\nhouses attached to it is the cheapest. But you can\nget only 8 to 10 houses per acre and most of them\nwill be two storeys high, thereby wasting enormous\npossibilities for vertical development.\nIndustrial land is infinitely more expensive, but\nin either case, the GLC holds the trump card. It\nhas the land.\nOf course, the GLC is embarrassed by its failure\nto provide enough of the type of accommodation\nthat students need. But it is a great deal more embarrassed by its lack of money. Even with the land,\nit can't afford to build.\nSo now, let's consider the money. Who has it?\nWhy, of course, the banks.\nNow, all students know that these vast institutions spend a small fortune every year in trying to\npersuade students to open accounts with them.\nThey offer this facility and that advantage, and they\nthrow in credit cards on top, hoping, of course, to\nattract the potential top-income man while he is\nyoung.\nThe most the banks can hope for is to hang on to\na sufficient percentage of such accounts in later\nyears, to make the expenditure worthwhile.\nPersonally, I am always horrified at the stupidity\nof the banks. The National Westminster, for ex-ample, as we all know, has a virtual monopoly at\nImperial College and yet they do almost nothing to\nencourage their student customers to put their\nfaith and their money in their hands.\nAny of you who have ever had to queue for\ntwenty minutes to cash your grant cheque will know\nwhat I mean.\nThey're in a lovely position, and it makes other\nbanks green when they think about it. I went, for\ninstance, to the Midland Bank and found them\nbleating about not getting student accounts.\nBut the chance to get those accounts is entirely\nin their hands. They could get the lot, I should\nthink, if they stopped to think about how they\ncould really help the students they so badly pine\nfor.\nIf you're ever lucky enough to get a look at the\nvaults of any bank in the City, you'll find the strong-rooms littered with gold bars. They're just laying\nthere, doing nothing in particular except looking\nyellow and interesting.\nI'm talking figuratively, of course. Those gold\nbars represent the idle capital which all banks have\non hand, waiting to be put to good and profitable\npurpose.\nAnd that is the crux of the matter.\nI on'ly suggest that instead of leaving it there, the\nbank\u2014that is, any bank with sufficient imagination \u2014 take several cart loads of their gold bars\nand turn them into bricks and mortar, upon which\nthey would earn money.\nIn short, use them to put up the money to build\nhalls of residence. Now, we have a useful equation.\nThe land held by the GLC plus the money from the\nbanks equals more student accommodation.\nFurthermore, there is benefit to each of the parts\nof the equation.\nThe GLC can fulfil its obligation to provide accommodation for students: the banks will be\nputting their gold bars to use and earning money on\nthem: and the students will have somewhere to\nlive.\nAdditionally, it is very likely that any bank which\nhas the foresight to fund such an operation will\nreap the additional benefit of gathering the accounts of the students they are helping.\nIt seems to me there is logic in this argument\nas well as considerable advantage to everyone con-cern ed. How much would it all cost? Based on the\nestimates for the hall of residence now being built\nfor the college \u2014 roughly three-quarters of a million pounds for a block accommodating 300 students \u2014 I estimate that a new hall capable of housing three hundred students on GLC land would\ncost one million pounds. For four blocks, four\nmillion.\nThe accommodation would, of course, be\nrented, the rents to be collected and handled by the\nStudents' Union in much the same way as it now\nhandles rented accommodation elsewhere in London.\nThus far, then, we have an idea. The next question is how to translate the idea into action.\nAnd this is where we came in.\nImperial College students union would be well\nI believe the National Union of Students and the\nadvised to apply pressure where it is most likely to\nproduce a reaction.\nRent strikes? Demonstrations? Fine. But would\nit not be more useful and much more positive to\ntwist the arm of those who really could do something to ease the problem of student ac com moda tion?\nWouldn't it be better, in fact, to put pressure.on\nthe banks?\nFor example, you remember the terrible trauma\nwhich gripped Barclays at the time their colonial\ninterests were the subject of student indignation\nand thousands of students closed their accounts?\nOf course, it is not part of my interest to get into\nthat kind of political argument, but it was a clear\nillustration of the power students have and can\nuse.\nA concerted effort to persuade a bank to think\nalong the lines I have sketched out might yield concrete results. Even to get such an idea considered\nwould be a beginning, but I feel quite sure that a unified campaign to promote it would make it difficult for the parties involved to resist. For my part,\nI am perfectly prepared to assist any group which\nfelt strongly enough about the problem to try this\nsolution.\nOne thing is sure. Nothing at all will be done\nunless you, the students, get up off your backsides\nand make it happen.\nSo my advice is just this.\nStrike \u2014- by all means. But if you are going to\nstrike \u2014 strike at the right target.\n\n"

Having checked that his pea was working well, the umpire blew up and the game started.\nStraight from the bully R.V. C. attacked. Unfortunately\nI.C. were still asleep and allowed the Vets captain an\nopen goal. However, so surprised was this individual,\nthat he missed. At this stage Wonder Boy struck with a superb goal. R.V. C. fought back and from a short\ncorner, Richard Cameron, our star goalkeeper opened\nhis legs, the ball went through and the score became\n1-1. I.C. regained the lead when W.B. scored again and\nincreased their score when Alan Brown (at the third\nattempt) put the ball in the goal. Unfortunately R.V. C. scored again before half time from a penalty flick after\n-the I.C. left back-cum-captain-cum-cripple kicked the\nball off the goal line. At the start of the second half\nI.C. surged into the attack and increased their lead\nwhen another W.B. thunder bd lt trickled over the line.\nThe rest of the match was uneventful apart from W.B. missing many more open go all s and some most peculiar\numpiring decisions which seemed to get worse as the\nmatch progressed \u2014 thanks for making the match,\namusing Mike. The result of the match\u2014I.C. won 4-2.\nComment by W.B. after the match:\u2014 I want p ne female for bull ! ! ! !\nfo or ball Kings II 2 I.C. IV 3 (HT 0-1)\nA day of persistent rain and wind at Mitcham saw\nIC IV's achieve a splendid and well merited victory\nagainst Kings II in a ULU reserves cup l st round tie.\nCaptain Dave Wilbeck won the toss and chose to\nplay with the slope and against the wind. In the opening 20 minutes the exchanges were fast and furious with\nIC however looking the better side. Despite this they\nwere nearly caught out when Tim Ryan in goal lost\nthe ball at the edge of his area and an accurate shot\nwas headed off the line by Chris Pattison. Steve Hancock had also to clear off the line but on at least\nthree occasions Kings defenders had to perform the\nsame task in periods of severe IC pressure.\nThe game developed into a pattern where the IC\nmidfield of Higham, McConvey and Colbeck were inter-passing neatly and playing the ball wide with Bill\nJoiner on the right wing especially effective whereas\nthe Kings mid fic kl were prone to play the ball forward\ntoo early and their forwards made litt ft e headway\nagainst a determined and resolute IC back four.\nIC were creating good situations, but after their\nearly close misses looked unlikely to score until a through ball enabled the Kings right back to slide the\nball neatly past his goalkeeper to give IC a half time\nlead.\nThe second half opened with the pattern much the\nsame but on the hour a fortunate bounce from a tackle\nset a forward free on the Kings left and he scored a fine equalise r with a rocket of a shot.\nKings made their big effort now but the IC defence\nwere covering well and tackling strongly with plenty\nof assistance from the rest of the side at dead ball\nsituations. In fact at one corner Mike (Kamikaze)\nButterworth made a name for himself tackling Kings\nforwards with his head.\nThis pressure was lifted when half way through the\nhalf IC scored two fine goals in a five minute period.\nThe first of these came when Mike Selwyn fed Bill\nJoiner on the right wing whose fine run took him\nbehind the defence and his accurate cross enabled Colin\nHigham to strike home a fine goal.\nIC's3 rd goal came a few minutes later from a corner\nwhich was allowed to drop for Mick McConvey to\nsmash home a superb left foot volley.\nFrom then on IC maintained control until with the\nlast kick of the match Kings pulled back a consolation goal. All in all a fine victory. Team: Ryan; Selwyn, Davies, Pallison, Hancock;\nColbeck, McConvey, Higham, Joiner, \"Ranger,\" Butterworth.\nMike Selwyn\nOn Wednesday the 6th of December, the football club's tame historian pulled off a remarkable feat by having the\npitches at Harlington playable even after the storms of the\nprevious two days \u2014 thank you Arthur. Now back to bus i ness, the 1st team played Chelsea and despite the gale and\nthe rain the game would have been a good one to watch. It\nwas a very open contest with both sides playing good football at times. I.C. took the lead in the first-half when Mick\nMcConvey beat two defenders before sliding the ball (as\nopposed to rolling it) into the corner of the net. Later in the\nfirst half Chelsea were lucky to score when G.E.( full name\nand address supplied) dropped a very awkward cross into\nhis own goal. In the second half the game was less even and\nI.C: 'began to make more chances. However none of these\nwere converted, instead Pete Lonner scored with a diving-cum-falling header to give I.C.a win which they merited\nand also a margin of victory which reflected the evenness of\nthe first-half.\nAlso on Wednesday the 2nds beat Chelsea 2nds40 with\nlittle trouble. The 4th went down to Goldsmiths II 6-4 in an\nexciting battle. The 5th s avenged this defeat in beating Goldsmiths III 7-3, and finally in an undistinguished match the\n6th s took two more valuable points when they beat Chelsea\nIII 3-2.\nR. Kill\nI.C.3 rds arrived late for the kick-off in their first round\nU.L, cup match against Goldsmiths 2nds, last years winners.\nThis was to have its effect when the later stages were played\nout in gathering gloom. Early in the game I.C. slow to settle\nwere subjected to strong pressure by the Goldsmiths team.\nJust as I.C. were beginning to play more confidently they suffered a setback when Alan Wilkinson had to leave the field to\nreplace a contact lens. While down to ten men they also\nunfortunately gave away a goal. Alan Peterson, back covering\nfor Wilkinson, was dispossessed at the edge of the area and\nthe Goldsmiths' forward made no mistake with his shot.\nI.C: were jolted into action by this setback and once back\nto full strength they took complete command of the midfield\nand goals began to look very likely. Indeed, the first goal\ncame following a free-kick just outside the penalty area. Ian\nHyslop won in the air but his effort was blocked and Peterson\nfollowing in had a shot blocked before Russ Smith came on\nthe blind side of the defence to score a deserved equalise r with\na well placed shot.\nI.C. were now in complete control of what was a very hard,\nbut fair game and they went close- several times before a second goal eventually arrived. Alan Pearson cut in strongly\nfrom the left and a great cross field pass put Geoff Gilbert\nthrough to score with an unstoppable low shot into the far\ncorner. This was the score at half-time and I.C. were now\nvery confidence of victory. They began the second half as\nthey had left off in the first, allowing Goldsmiths very little\ntime or space. The Goldsmiths front line was well held by\nthe I.C. back four, Andy Jackson being outstanding in the\nmiddle while Rob Young and Adrian Johns gave their\nwingers no freedom at all.\nA third goal came just as things were beginning to settle\ndown in the second half. A superb run by John Miles came to\nan abrupt end when he was brought down inside the area\nand a penalty was awarded. .Smith volunteered to take the\nkick and he blasted a shot which the 'keeper dived to save.\nHowever, the referee judged that the goalkeeper had moved\nbefore the ball was kicked and I.C. were allowed a second\nchance. This time Smith adopted the 'cool' approach and succeeded in sending the goalkeeper the wrong way to put I.C31 ahead. From this point on I.C: merely had to keep things\ntight in midfield and the game was theirs. In fact most of\nthe subsequent action was in the Goldsmith's half and several times I.C. were unlucky not to increase their lead. The\ngame ended in near darkness with I.C.31 winners, and so\nGoldsmiths, who last year beat I.C.3 rds in the semi-final and\nI.C.2 nds in the final, were out in the first round to an I.C. side who must now have a great chance of lifting the trophy\nthemselves.\nTeam: M. Clark, A. Johns, R. Young, A. Wilkinson, A. Jackson, T. Hyslop (capt.), G. Gilbert, A. Peterson, R. Smith,\nJ. Miles, A. Pearson.\nAlso on Saturday the 6th played Westfield 2nds in the\nL.R. Cup at Harlington. The game was played in. an incessant drizzle and the small pitch and greasy conditions gave\nneither side the chance to play good football. The first half\nwas fairly even with I.C. just about having the advantage and\nalthough Johnny Black went close twice the score was still\n0-0 when the teams changed around.\nIn the second half Westfield looked more purposeful and\na mistake by Ian Bell followed by a goal keeping error gave\nWestfield a deserved lead. Another defensive muddle allowed\nthe lead to be increased shortly afterwards.\nAs the half wore on the 6th began to find their feet (in-tell i gent team, the 6th s), and Johnny Black pulled one back\nwith a fine goal after beating two Westfield defenders on the\n18-yard line. Inspired by this the 6th s forced a series of\ncorners and from one of these Dave Ivell picked up a half-clearance and shot home from 15-yards.\nTeams often claim they cannot win if the referee is on the\nopposing side and when Ron Kill picked up a ball (you mean\nthere were more than one, Rob?) on the right and strode\nthrough the dusk to hit a pile driver home from 30 yards,\nWestfield felt a little pissed off!\nAfter the match the 6th team manager, captain and supposed shirt washer Rob (call me Sir Alf) Carty refused to say\nwhat his team's chances were of winning the cup.\nTeam: R. Colston, I Bell, G. Gull, D. Crane, R. Kill (also\nthe unpaid ref.), A. Kang, R. Carty, I. Franklin, J. Black, D. Ivell, E. Heap.\nR.C./ R.K. cross e Pete shines in new boots\nOn a wet and blustery Saturday afternoon, IC Lacrosse team faced a formidable task in maintaining uT eir unbeaten record against Kenton, one of the strongest\nteams in the league. With his usual panache, Paul\nSpooner chose to start the game facing in the direction\nof the incoming flight-path to Heathrow, obviously\nhoping to distract their goalie.\nThat this was going to be no ordinary game was\ndemonstrated, in the first few minutes, when Bob\nStrangeway \"using\" his head for once, stopped a shot\nat goal, and was reduced to a mere shadow of his usual\nferocious (?) self. As usual IC insisted on presenting\nKenton with the first two goals, but Imperial soon\npulled one back when Tony Hallett was given the five\nminutes he needs to position himself and place the ball\nin the net.\nKenton continued to score regularly, but the IC team\nwas never more than two goals behind thanks to the\nefforts of Steve Norris, who produced some fine twenty yard shots (a pity he's not fitter).\nWith only a few minutes of play left it looked a hard task for IC to make up the two-goal deficit. However, continuous pressure from the IC forwards levelled\nthe score and when a shot rolled along the ground, hit\nan opponent's foot and bounced past their goalie's right\near into the top corner of the net, IC went into the lead\nfor the first time in the match. This goal provided Pete\nDrury, mercurial in his new boots, with his hat trick for\nthe match. > -Valiant play by Ian Gulliford, who had a magnificent\ngame in goal, could not prevent Kenton from just managing to score the equalise r in the dying seconds. Final\nscore 9-9.\nIC Team (signed at small expense): Ian Gulliford,\nJack Katzberg, Frank Craven, Bob (puff, puff) Strangeway, Pete \"the hoots\". Drury, Paul \"Whizz Kid\" Spooner, Ray Elms, Lionel Clarke (Asst. Secretary!!), Steve\nNorris and Tony Hallett.\nPaddy\nPathfinder\nPicture this: 'tis dead of night in the most inclement l) wit weather when a solitary appears out of the murk.\nSuddenly an un lit parked car looms up in front of the\nrider (our star runner) forcing him to swerve, and he\nends up sprawled across the road, viciously hitting the\npetrol tank with his ankle in the process. Thus did the\nFates rob IC of their chance of medals in the UL\nchampionships.\nDespite the loss of Joe Keating and many others of\nour best runners, we still managed to field a team (Pete\nJohnson, Dave Jones, Ian Isherwood, Stuart Littlewood,\nRob Allinson, Paul. Clarke and Rob Parker) when, after\na five mile slither through ankle-deep mud, finished\nfourth (\"narrowly\" missing 3rd place). Included in this\nrace was the intercollegiate championship which was\nwon by RCS: C&G had no runners, and RSM had one,\nand he was lost.\nLast Wednesday's race, the Osterley Park Relay, was\neven muddier. Our 'A' team finished27 th; positions and\ntimes after each 3 mile lap were: 16 Rob Parker 15m51s;28 Dave Payne L8m 10s; Chris Haines 16m17s;27 Rob Allison 17m.53s. The 'B' team was started off\nby Dave Jones (41st and not last) in 19m6s and he\nhanded over to Paddy Donnelly who returned 32 minutes later. Suddenlyfindinghimself on the M4, Paddy\nturned back before he reached Wales and proceeded\nalong the course by a highly skilful application of the\ninspection of footprints. Unfortunately the effect was\nsomewhat spoiled by his following them in the wrong\ndirection. Meanwhile, back at the start, Steve Webb\nhad become so damp and cold that he set off without\nwaiting for Paddy. One can only imagine the look of\nquestioning that passed between them when they met\nhalfway across a field of mud.\nOn the way home Steve had a hand-waving argument\nwith the driver of another vehicle \u2014 a strange way of\nexpressing his remorse at not being able to race.\n\n"

Sir,\u2014This letter, as your\noverwhelming perception will\nalready have noted, is coming to you from the frenetic\nprecincts of the U.S.A.,' known to its residents as\nAmerica or the most powerful country in the World.\nBoth these statements are,\nof course, open to the debate that their inherent discrepancies cause; however,\nbeing subject myself to a similar kind of paranoia as\npermeates the land, I find\nmyself temporarily lodged\nwithin its somewhat grossly\nmapped confines. Being also,\nas many within your institution can verify, somewhat\namericanized in style, I am\nalso forced into a position\nof believing fervently in the\nmaxim, \"when in Rome do as\nRome does\".\nWhich leads obviously,\nwhen residing with an American family in a small town in\nNew England, to passing the\nevenings lounging in gracious\nharmony in the sitting room,\nglued un relentlessly to the\ntelevision. Within this particularly remarkable little instrument reside some quite\namazing characters. Aside\nfrom their remarkable ability\nto be green one day and\npurple the next, their extreme\ntenacity in the face of continued odds, which incidentally would put any ordinary 22 inch tall person out\nof action in less than no\ntime, remain incredible feats\nof endurance to my meagre\nhuman eyes. Aside from\nthese superb qualities, and\nmany others un mentioned, there exists a kind of elevated status amongst these\nmass-produced mini-people,\nraising them above us ordinary whelks, in our ordinary\nview, of course.\nTake Mark Spitz, for ex-ample. His handsome face\ngraces the screen with monotonous regularity, enthusing\nover himself in various products which he uses; including approximately four\nmakes of aftershave and\ncologne, which has led to\nour presumptuously cynical\nsupposition that he must\nswim in the stuff. Another\nchap who appears, less regularly, is a sugar-tongued\nCalifornian with a genius for\nsaying nothing in more than\na thousand words, known as\nRichard Nixon. We are told\nthat he has a second job\nwhich has something to do\nwith running the corrupt ry; sorry, that should be co un try.\nAnother character who\nwe are here rather fond of is\na chap who works. for the\nLos Angeles police department (turn left at the drapery department) known as\nJoe Colombo, Colombo to\nhis friends. And he's just\nbeen on! Brightening up our\nSunday evening was an NBC\nmystery movie special with\nColombo helping good old\nNew Scotland Yard solve a murder. It was a pretty\nfunny show, with ; Colpmbo\nbeing the archetypal, 'over-zealous, camera - hugging,\nbrash, sleazy American tourist every Briton loves to hate,\nwhilst, as an incident, solving the murder'. It was sol:\nved, and this brings us close\nto the point, in the London\nWax Museum. i Having already passed an\nenjoyable two hours pointing\nout the landmarks to the\nlocals here (happiness is being the centre of attention)\nthe picture changed after a message from Big Wally\nabout a paint -and the scene\nwas the London Wax Museum. There follows the text\nof a conversation between\nWill, 14-year-old son of the\nfamily, and Ian, occasional\nfamily appendage (that's me)'-Will: \"We went there,\ndidnt we?\" i; Ian: \"Hell, no. You went\nto Madame Tussaud's \"\u2022\nWill: \"So Where's that?\"\nIan: \"On Baker Street\".\nWill: \"Jeez, are you ever\ndumb. I meant where's the\nLondon Wax Museum, st up id!?\"\nIan adopts musing pose,\nruminating simultaneously\nover the despicable quality\nof Will's vocabulary, and the\nvaguely familiar bastion\nhousing the London Wax\nMuseum. Then laughs.\nIan: \"Good grief! They\nfinally found a decent use\nfor it\".\nWill: \"For what?\"\nIan: \"The London Wax\nMuseum\".\nWill: . \"You said there\nwasn'ta London Wax Museum\".\nIan: \"That's what I said, I hope there is now\".\nWill: \"Why don't you ever\ntalk sense?\"\nIan: \"Listen, peasant. That\nbuilding with London Wax\nMuseum written on it\u2014\n/ went to college there.\"\nWill: (cracking up): \"You\nWhat? (helpless giggles).\nYou went to College?\"\nIan (with a feeble attempt\nat firmness): \"Yes I did. For\nseven weeks I attended the\nImperial College, London\".\nI did and am proud of it.\nAnd so the purpose of this\nletter is to wish everybody\nwell, for it was a warm\nfeeling seeing Prince Con-,\nsort Road again. Hope there's not still as much horn in ess as when I was there, bad for\nthe soul, don't you know.\nMaybe a little less logic\nwould come in handy too.\nGreetings to Mr. Cory and\nthe dude on the sixth floor of\nElec Eng with the pretty\nwife, the glasses, and the\nname I remember as being\nunforgettable but ' can't re-member; Phil, George, John\nHarding et al.\nLove,\nIAN STOCK.\nP.S. Pardon this stupidity,\nbut if Theresa had called it\nwouldn't have been necessary. Readers' Letters\nIn defence\nof NUS ,\nSir,\u2014Ross McBeath obviously did not enjoy what\nwas presumably his first NUS\nConference. . Most of the\nother IC students who were\nin Margate disagree entirely\nwith his report on this con-ference.\nConference was not just\na fight between the Communist Party and the Trotskyists\nas he states. Unlike at previous conferences, at this\nconference the Trotskyists\nwere very little in evidence\nand where they did put their\nline it was generally overwhelmingly rejected. The\nmain opposition to the exec\nuti ve on the grants motion,\nfor example, came from colleges such as UCL, IC,\nWhitelands and Sussex, who\nwere rejecting the Exec's vague and limited demands\nand instead putting forward\nclear demands which were\nmore likely to initiate a successful campaign on grants\nwhich is what all students\nwant. In proposing that we\nfight for abolition of the\nmeans test we were attempting to get the NUS Exec to\naccept an aim that most students have already agreed to\nso that in this case the CP\nwas being reactionary. (For a fuller report on this see\nCEFE No. 8).\nRoss McBeath complains\nthat the main motions were\nalways passed, and says this\nwas because the delegates\nhad actually forgotten what\nthey were. Maybe he, as\npress officer, was not paying\nproper attention but the delegates were perfectly well\naware of what the main\nmotion was.\nMain motions are often\npassed because of the way\nthey are put together: In the\ncompositing session which\ntakes place before the debate in conference, all the\ncolleges which have submitted motions on a particular\nsubject (and with subjects\nsuch as autonomy, grants,\nthere are very many) t^?t together and form one main\nmotion with several amend-ment s. Thus a main motion\nis an amalgam of the ideas\nof many people, is not very\ncontroversial and is bound\nto get a lot of support. This\nis very necessary because if\nmain motions were very controversial they would often\nbe rejected and NUS policy\nwould never be updated.\nThis also results in greater\ndemocracy as much of policy\nis decided at college level\u2014\nin the submitting of main\nmotions.\nIn future things will be\neven more democratic due\nto a motion passed in Conference Reform putting the\ndate of the November conference two weeks later so\nthat motions no longer have\nto be submitted before the\nbeginning of the Autumn\nterm \u2014 a very useful reform which Ross McBeath\ndid not mention when condemning the previous system.\nAny student has the right\nto submit a motion for NUS\nConference at a UGM in his\ncollege and if your union\nagrees with it, it goes forward to NUS. Thus you are\nperfectly at liberty to put in\nsome nice reactionary motions such as \"let's all have\na decrease in grants or a loans system, let's have\nMaggie Thatcher controlling\neverything the unions do,\nlet's pay higher hall fees,\netc.\". If your union has a large right wing element as\nR. McBeath seems to think\nthere is, then such motions\nwill get passed and go to\nconference. Would it be too\nmuch to say that this does\nnot happen because students\ndo not in general agree with\nsuch proposals?\nAs for the delegates to\nconference, one cannot get\naway from the fact that they\nare elected. If our union\nelects Piers Corbyn to go to\nNUS, it means that our\nunion wants to be represented by Piers Corbyn. If Tory\nstudents want Tory delegates they can elect them.\nFinally R. McBeath denies\nthat students have any power\nto achieve their aims. This\nis the argument continually\nput forward by the Trotskyists and is an excuse for not\ndoing anything more than\ngenerally supporting workers'\nstruggles. A \"national student strike\" cannot be compared (as he does) with a TUC General Strike, in the\nsame way as a strike by\njust postmen (say) cannot be\ncompared with a general\nstrike of all workers. It is\ntrue to say that students do\nnot have the same economic\npower as other workers in\nthat simply not attending lectures does not have the same\neffect as electricity workers\nnot turning up to work. But\neven boycott of lectures has\nbeen used successfully in\nsome colleges to achieve certain aims, particularly in disputes within colleges or departments rather than on a national scale. One does not\nhave the power to bring the\ncountry to a halt in order to\nachieve anything; a strike of\nteachers, cleaners, television\nworkers and many others\ndoes not bring the country\nto a halt but this does not\nprevent them from using this\ntactic successfully. Students\ncan and must use the power\nthey have to the best they\ncan. Rather than withdrawing their labour, students\nhave more power to withdraw\ntheir money, i.e. to not pay\nrent or high prices in re fec tories, etc. If this is properly\norganised nationally with\nstudents in each college taking the action most suitable\nto their situation, we will\nhave an effect on the govern-ment. Recently students have\nhad an important effect in\nforcing the government to\nwithdraw its proposals to\ncut union autonomy. R. McBeath simply \"does not include this\". Students in\nindividual colleges have had\nsuccesses by using the power they have. If you just do\nnot include the successes,\nbut only look at everything\nelse then you are bound to\ncome to the conclusion that\nstudents have no power but\nthis simply becomes ridiculous. It is through NUS that\nnational campaigns can best\nbe organised. NUS is our\nnational union and as such\nis very relevant. Of course\nsome people in any situation\nlike to sit back and watch\nothers fight for them and\nthen reap the ben q fits. I don't. Of course NUS has its\nfaults but it is up to us to\nremedy them rather than\nwithdraw and make NUS\neven less effective.\nFelix should certainly include personal minority opinions but not as the main\nnews report on something as\nimportant as NUS Conference. Students who were not\nthere should have the opportunity to judge for themselves rather than be presented with a set of arguments\nin favour of leaving NUS.\nYours sincerely,\nSON!A HOCHFELDER.\nJewsmore\nconfusion\nSir,\u2014In reply to Sonia\nHochfelder's letter, subtitled\n\"Jews, Jowitt and Jeneralisations\", I think we both\nmissed slightly the point of\nyour article and my letter.\nIf I conveyed the opinion\nthat I accused you of saying\nthe Israeli Government was\ninvolved directly with the\nMunich Olympics, then I am\nsorry.

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX December 12, 1972\nANOTHER LETTER\nI0HN LANE\nBrand new, out-this-very-week, came the Tory White\nPaper on education policy \"Divide and Rule \u2014 Part\n4\". You will be hearing lots more about this but the\nfirst point we have to note is that the increase in,\nnursery education (welcome but still inadequate) will be\nat the expense of further restrictions on higher education spending, in addition to those already operating.\nThe College authorities will, of course, make gentlemanly protests to the government and then will proceed to work within the (limits set. Student representatives on committees will be press uri sed into accepting\nthese limits \"in the interests of future generations of\nstudents\" and asked to agree to rent rises, food price\nincreases, etc., instead of fighting them. The result\nwould be confusion in the union, no fights against the\nGovernment cut-backs and the way left open to further attacks.\nA concrete example is\narising in this Union. Two\nyears ago I.C. Union, out\nof the goodness of its\nheart, agreed to a levy of\n35p on top of the hall\n9\nPresident's On\nCampaigns\nSir,\u2014Once again Dowson\nhits the nail right on the\nthumb! Firstly John Lane is\nnot the first political president that ICU has had for\nseveral years; of the three\nelected presidents up till\nthis year. Piers Corbyn,\nJudith Walker and John McCulough, only the last was\nnon-political. Piers needing\nno comment, and Judith\nhaving been elected on a Soc.Soc. platform. And incidentally John Lane is a Statistics postgraduate, one\nwould have thought that a full-time editor could get\nfacts like that correct.\nTo go over to McBeath's( sic) article on NUS confer-en ce, it should thirdly be\nnoted that there is not a majority of Communist\nParty members on NUS exec-uti ve, there are exactly 3 out\nof 15.\nMore importantly the\nauthor betrays a vast ignorance of the role NUS does\nplay amongst students, as\nwell as the role that the CP.\nplays in NUS. To say that\nCP. policies are adopted at\nNUS conferences because of\nclashes between a 'Commun-ist' Executive (already commented on) and extreme left\ngroups on the floor, is ludicrous and a slur on the delegates who belong to neither\nof these groups (i.e. the\nmajority; IC's delegation\nconsisted of one ultra-left\nand five others, and doubtless other delegations were\nmuch the same), the reason\nwhy CP. policies are frequently adopted is that they\nref lec j. the needs of the student body as a whole.\nMcBeath goes on to say\nthat the conference showed\nlack of consideration for the\n600,000 students NUS represents. Again this is rubbish,\nif NUS were not considering\nali students then there would\nbe no campaigns at all on\ngrants,: housing, Union aut-ono my, etc., instead the\nstandard of living of all students would be allowed to\nplummet, and Thatcher\nwould be able to run roughshod over the constituent\nUnions, without any opp osi tion. That would be true lack\nof consideration. Here it\nmust be remembered that\nConference lays down the\nbroad outline for action by\nNUS, it is up to the Executive to work out the details.\nThus conference called for a rent strike to keep down Hall\nfees, it is now the Executive's job to ensure that no\nstudent suffers for implementing this.\nMr. McBeath is correct to\nsay that there is a lack of\ninterest in NUS amongst a large section of students \u2014\nand this article seems deliberately designed to reinforce this lack of i pte rest! Of course NUS hasn't got\nthe economic power that\nTrades Unions have, however\nwe must be prepared to use\nwhat little we have, for example in the form of rent\nstrikes which put pressure\non College Authorities and,\nthrough them, on the Government. It must be remembered that we are not students for our own good, we\nare students primarily because Industry needs highly-trained people; and this too\ngives us some strengths.\nWhile we are students learning skills which industry will\nlater use to make large profits for shareholders, we\nshould and must demand\ngrants that give us a decent\nstandard of living, and only\nby combining our strengths\ninto one body can we hope to\nwin these rights \u2014 and that\nbody must be NUS. If the\naction of students up and\ndown the country led by\nNUS did not force the withdrawal of the DES Green\nPaper on Union Autonomy,\nperhaps Mr. McBeath could\ninform us what did. Certainly Thatcher didn't withdraw\nit out of the goodness of her\nheart! It was student action\nwhich forced her, and it\nshows what can be done on\nother issues if we try \u2014 and\ntry we must!\nThis particular issue demonstrates another aspect of\nthe power of students \u2014- and\nthat is their ability to win\nsupport in specific cam-pa ign s. The NUS mobil is a tion last year was able to\ngain support from sections as\ndiverse as Vice Chancellors,\nthe Parliamentary Labour\nParty and the National Union\nof Mineworkers (the possibility of further Trade Union\nsupport is potentially the\nmost valuable and reliable by\nfar). The key point is that\nthrough united national ac-tion, NUS got the Thatcher\nproposals (temporarily) with-drawn.\nFinally McBeath's comparison of NUS with Parliament betrays an incredible\nnaivety. Does he believe\nMPs really vote on 'con-science' grounds? If so,\nwould he like to analyse the\nthalidomide debate, or the\ncontinued Tory support for\nthe bestial war in Vietnam?\nAnd when he talks about the\n\"selection process that eliminates radical elements auto-mati call y\", one can only\nassume from this that he\nmeans left-wing (of any\nshade) and excludes the\nultra-rightists of the Monday\nClub, etc. To condemn NUS\nfor being more democratic\nthan Parliament is a weird\nargument indeed.\nOn behalf of IC Communis: Party Branch,\nYours hopefully,\nPAUL WATKINS.\nrents, to pay for now halls,\nbecause rents were comparatively low. Since then\nstudents' standards of living have fallen drastically owing to inflation\nand it is common for students to spend two years\nin bed-sits at \u00a35-\u00a36 a week\nrents (or even higher),\nwhich more than compensates for one year in Hall\nat a lower rent.\nThe College would like\nus this time to increase the\nlevy. As well as this, when\nthe Northside Hall is fin i shed, they will wan it an increase in all rents to help\npay for it. A sub-com-mitte e is being set up\nwhich Will deal with the\nlevel of rents next year.\nOur policy should be\nquite clear. It should not\nbe the responsibility of\ntoday's students to build\nhalls or refectories for\nfuture students. This is the\nresponsibility Of society\nas a whole and the money\nshould come from the rich\nand the big monopolies,\nwho instead are getting\ntax cuts (by the way, Distillers' Co. Ltd. Of thalidomide fame made \"only\"\n\u00a364,000,000 last year).\nWe must take no responsibility for doing the\ndirty . work for the Tory\nparty and its industrial\nbackers. We must state\nclearly that we will not\naccept any rent rises without a corresponding grant\nincrease.\nHall Cleaners\nRumours have been rife\nthat the college want to\nreduce the number of\ncleaners in halls. I have\nascertained that the Student Hall Committee including the wardens know\nnothing of this. It is up\nto us and the cleaners'\nunion, NUPE (National\nUnion Of Public Employees) to nip this in the bud.\nThis would be yet another\nattack on students' living\nstandards and would we\nget a rent reduction to\ncompensate? Not on your\nlife, it would go towards\nletting the government off\nthe hook on paying for\nnew halls.\nThis is a clear-cut example of how we can\nwork with trade unions to\ndefend each others' in-te rests. Grants Campaign\nNUS Conference launched a national grants\ncampaign with its main\npoints being a \u00a365 in-crease, an end to discrimination against married women and to discretionary awards, no rent increases and no refectory\nprice increases. Several\nmeetings in i the next few\nweeks will thrash out a plan of campaign for next\nterm. But, meanwhile,\nNUS regards the main\nspring board for its campaign as the rent strikes\nalready taking place all\nover the country where\nrents have increased or\nthe amount allowed for in\nthe grant, and which are\nspreading rapidly even into London where hall\nrents are sometimes lower.\nFor example, LSE go on\nrent strike next term.\nThe first UGM of next\nterm (Thursday 18th January) will discuss our\ntactics for the grants campaign including rent strike\nrefectory boycotts, demos,\netc.\nIn the meanwhile would\na,M students in hall please\nwait until after the UGM\nbefore paying the hall\nbills. I will ensure that all\nstudents in hall or house\nget details of how rent\nstrike could operate at\nthe start of next term before any decision is taken.\nHope you all have a fine\nChristmas and New Year,\nbut don't get drunk on\nDistillers' stuff and have a thought for all those poor\nScots fellow-students of\nmine go in Wi ou chur dram\non Hogmanay!\nCHARLIE CHflPUIl\nvS xs greater\nPRULETTE GQBDRR0\nJACK DRKIE\nWritten, Directed and Produced\nby Charles Chaplin\nDistributed by Black Ink Films Ltd.\nClassic BAKER STREET\nClassic HAMPSTEAB\nMARTINS BIT\nEE\nMartin's Bit this week was to have reviewed the term\nfrom my point of view.

One could\nfeel the tension amongst the Union Exec relax almost\ninstantly the news of the ratification came in. But relax\nis the one thing we can't do.\nImperial College Union has lost a lot of ground and\na lot of credibility in the last term. This has mainly\nbeen because it has been disorganised: at least, it has\nseemed so to the casual onlooker. The set-up of the\nbureaucratic background has been impeccable: it has\nbeen so good it has been invisible, which is really just\nthe way it should be. But since all we've had is the\nbureaucracy, the whole union activities have been just\nas invisible to the mass membership.\nNow we have a President perhaps we can get down to\nsome ACTION. The active side of the Union, the side\nthat the membership and the general public notice, is its\npolitical side. The clubs and societies fall into the\nbureaucratic sector \u2014 they just go on and on and on\nas long as the money's there. They might well be\nUnion activities \u2014 but the membership couldn't care\nless who runs them as long as they're there.\nThe Sovereign body of the Union is the Union General Meeting \u2014 the meeting of all its members, or a representative sample of them \u2014 a meeting of all of\nYOU. That's where the action must be seen to happen.\nTuesday's EGM proved that students here are interested in politics. Not necessarily the revolutionary\npolitics the public expects of us (only 15 people at the\nlast SocSoc meeting) but politics generally. It doesn't matter how conservative and reactionary our politics\nare (and I hope some conservative ad reactionary policies are passed by UGM's in the coming months, for\nthat is the general political feeling of ICU) as long as\nwe have some. For it is politics that makes UGM's, and,\nbeing really the only debating forum that exists in Imperial College since the sad demise of DebSoc, political\nUGM's should be encouraged.\nUGM's are not for the reading of long executive\nreports. These should be printed in \"Felix\" for everyone to read. UGM's are for the discussion of matters\nthat are important to students, and for the formulating\nof Union policy . . ; a policy that is representative\nof the Union's views \u2014 your views.\nNow we have a President \u2014 a political President \u2014\nperhaps we can move rapidly towards this kind of\nUGM. I certainly hope so.\nTwitching Whiskers\nWhile we're on the subject of politics, you will probably notice that, with this issue, not only has Felix\nbeen twitching his whiskers rather more than usual, but\nhas become decidedly political in one way or another.\nI hope this show of sudden virility in a23 year-old tabby\ncat does not alarm you: it was not deliberate, but just\nhappened.\nFor many weeks now the Letters page of \"Felix\"\nhas been unprecedented ly full. It would seem that,\neven compared to other weeklies Felix has a more active Letters page than other student newspapers. Let's keep it that way. I only apologise for having to print\nthem in such miniature type.\nAnd now it is truly heartening to see contributions\nin the form of articles also flooding in. There's some\npretty controversial stuff, by Felix standards, in this\nissue, and I hope there'll be some reaction.\nComing just at the right time, with the subject of\nRent Strikes being regularly mooted, is our \"Felix Financially\" feature on student housing. Derek Cummings' solution to this cardinal problem has certainly\nnever been raised or even suggested before. It bears\ncareful consideration. It's all very well to demand that\nthe Government pays for all new halls . . . but will we\never get any that way? We need somewhere to live, whoever pays for it SOON. We want your reactions to the\nscheme: do write and tell us what you think \u2014 NOW,\nwhile it's in your mind.\nEGM\nConfirms\nl.C. Gounci\nvotes to\nLane as withdraw\nPresident from SUK\nJohn Lane was once again ratified as President of\nImperial College Union by Tuesday's Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting. The meeting, convened as a result\nof the fiasco of the previous Thursday's Union General Meeting, reported in \"Felix\" last week, overwhelmingly voted to accept Council's recommendation that\nMr. Lane be confirmed in his post. Council had at\ntheir meeting the previous day voted to refer the motion\nback to the EGM with this recommendation.\nThe only question raised of the Union voiced their\nwas whether the College ,\u2022 , t, \u2022\n\u00b0 disapproval ot making\nwould agree to accept the\nratification: Martin Black, the sc changes after the\nUnion Secretary, said it eve nt, both at the Council\nwas very unlikely that they meeting and l heE GM would not.

The Rag\nChairman will once again become the Carniva* Coordinator, and IC Carnival will be res sure c ted. The main problems with USK Rag has been the\nlack of participation by other colleges. The City and\nGuild's Carnival Ball was cited as an example \u2014 95\nper cent of those attending came from I.C. Council\nconcluded that if I.C. were responsible for all the activity, it may as well be the I.C. Rag. Apparently USK\nRag has not been a financial success either.\nRag Chairman Paul Hosking revealed the accounts\nto an expectant audience. Income this term has been\n\u00a31,968.18, of which \u00a31.669.54 came from street collections. Expenditure came to a paltry \u00a355.62.\nCouncil News. m in\nA meeting is to be or- re fc ct0 ries and standards\ngan is ed to allow students of food,\nto question Mr. Mooney The Right Honourable\nin person, and to put their the Viscount Gough has\ncomplaints to him about become a life member of\n_ Imperial College Union.\nTwo Good Things Last Monday (December\n4th) there was yet another\nStudents' Representative\nCouncil meeting at which\ntwo useful events took\nplace. Firstly, a motion\nwas proposed to the effect\nthat there should be an\nSRC Murray Open Meeting held next term, to\nwhich every student in the\nUniversity should be in-vite d, and at which all who\nattend should be given full\nvoting and speaking rights.\nThis meeting will take the\nform of a discussion on\nthe Murray Report, and it\nis hoped that it will help\nthe SRC to formulate policy on the Report. In spite\nof an amendment which\nargued that non-SRC stu-dents' present should not\nbe given voting rights, the\noriginal motion was eventually passed. This could\nbe classed as the most representative decision the\nSRC has taken this term.\nThe second Good Thing\nwas the reaction of the\nSRC to the article in the\nlatest edition of \"Sennet\".\nThis points out that the\nCouncil is not at present\nrepresentative, in that\nmembers are rarely elected\nby their Unions, but are\noften appointed instead.\nOnce this had been demonstrated to the delegates\nthey appeared quite willing to consider Constitutional Amendments, which\nwill be presented formally\nat the next statutory meet-ing, to be held at Chelsea\nCollege on 17th February.\nThe Ents Committee is\n\u00a31,250 in the black. This\nis a result of booking big-name groups this year, a policy which has reaped\nrich rewards. All profits\nare to be ploughed back\ninto Ents next year.\nPOST-GRADUATE\nwanted for\nPart-time Teaching\nof O level Maths.\n1 morning per week.\nGood hourly rate.\nRing:\nIan Mackenzie, Int. 3887\n\n"
