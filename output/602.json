It\nremains to be seen whether our glorious\nPresident will pick up his hot-line to Keith\nJoseph and instruct the government to change\nits policy. Anyone who doubts ICU's ability to\nmount any sort of campaign against grant cuts\nwhile isolated from the rest of the student\nmovement is invited to get in touch with the\nLabour Club. We will be supporting the NUS campaign.\nComing Soon: Our first major speaker this\nterm will be Neil Kinnock MP, opposition\nspokesman on education, on February 2 in\nME220 at 1:00pm. A member of the Labour\nParty's National Executive Committee, he has\nbeen heavily criticised by the Bennite faction\nfor his crucial votes opposing the endorsement\nof Peter Tatchell and supporting an enquiry\ninto the militant tendency.

There are many seats still available,\nand the system operating is that seats on the\ncoach will cost \u00a33 per person with cash back\ndepending on sales of Rag Mags. Thus you can\nhave a cheap trip to see any pals in Cambridge, a free trip by selling lots of Rag\nMags, or a combination of both. Refunds will\nbe of the order of \u00a31 for 20 Rag Mags sold, and\nconsidering the vast hordes of suckers, sorry\nstudents, available, sales of 100 or more are\npossible.

The principal method remains the letter-writing campaign, in\nwhich letters on behalf of a person imprisoned\nfor non-violent adherence to his beliefs arrive\nsimultaneously from thousands of Amnesty\nmembers throughout the world. Many prisoners have testified that such a deluge of\nletters has caused a marked improvement in\ntheir treatment, and often their immediate\nrelease.\nThe group's adopted prisoner is a student,\nFirmin Awadon of Benin, who was arrested,\nbut not charged in 1979 after students had\nformed their own 'Action Group' to oppose\nthe government-controlled body which until\nthen was their only representation. Enquiries\nabout his legal position are not answered by\nhis government. The group is looking into the\npossibility of obtaining the help of firms which\ntrade in Benin.\nBefore adopting a prisoner Amnesty International conducts an investigation to\nascertain whether the person is imprisoned for\nhis beliefs and whether he has used or\nadvocated violence. The IC group is helping\nwith such a preliminary investigation for a prisoner in Sri Lanka.\nSnooker\nBoth the handicap and open tournaments are\nwell under way now, and the deadline for first\nround matches to be completed has been set\nat January 29. If you haven't played yet, put a notice up on one of the boards in the snooker\nroom (where the draws for each tournament\nare) for your opponent listing the times you\ncan play. If matches haven't been completed\nby the date, the winner will be decided by\nchosing the person who has made most effort\nto play the game. The B table will be set aside\nfor match play only on Tuesday26 and Thursday 28 January, and you can now book\ntwo hour slots (at any time) to play matches.\nBest of luck to everyone, but watch out for\nnosebleed specialist Jennings.\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir\nAndrew Lyall's reply to my\nletter was the predictable outburst of feigned hurt that I expected. His allegations are\nnothing short of slanderous\nand are no doubt the release\nfor the emotional strain imposed upon one who has\nlived in a building that is\ncollapsing around his ears for\nfive years.\nNot surprisingly he makes\nus scapegoats for the in competence of Weeks Hall residents and lays the ills of\nthe world at the doors of\nGarden Hall. He complained\nthat my letter was not based\non facts and then proceeds to\nmake wild and unsubstantial\nallegations himself.\nIt is more than likely that a Weeks Hall resident put\nwashing powder into the\ndrying machine. This would\nin turn explain Mr All Ly's observation that damp washing was removed from the\ndrier, as the average Weeks\nHall resident cannot distinguish between the washing\nmachine and the drier he\nprobably saw the clothes\nbeing removed from the\nwashing machine and mistook\nit for the drier!\nIndeed I myself can cite one\noccasion on which I removed\na combat jacket from the\ndrier and burnt my fingers on\nit because it had been left in\nfor far too long!\nThe state of Garden Hall's laundry is not the fault of the\npresent residents and indeed\nit could not possibly be as\nit has been out of action since\nthe summer. The damage was\ncaused by tenants to whom\nthe rooms were let over the\nsummer. Besides breaking the\nwashing machine and the\ndrier they also stole the iron\nfor good measure.\nAndrew Lyall has the nerve\nto suggest that we apologise\nfor damage caused by Weeks\nhall residents. I suggest that\nhe apologise to the residents of\nGarden Hall for the damage\nhe has inflicted upon our\ncharacters by depicting us as\nnothing more than vandals\nand criminals.\nJ ours oppressed\nDuncan Reid\nSir\nI read in FELIX601 Mr Twadowski's letter informing\nyour readers of my somewhat\nun social working hours and\nrem cm lier well the incident to\nwhich he refers.\nOf course I appreciate that\na bicycle is the most economical way to travel at 5:00am, and also that Mr Twadowski\nhad to unlock his bicycle\nbefore pedalling it off into the\nnight, but with a hacksaw?\nTour o he die nl servant\nBarney McCabe Dear Sir\n* Please could you include\nthe following letter which is\naddressed to all tutors. Students with tutors who do\nnot regularly read your columns could draw their\nattention to it:\nTo all tutors.\nEvery pound p roll t that the\nIC Bookshop makes goes to\nthe students union and thereby eases the demands on the\nCollege's finances.\nFor example, a lecturer\nwho recommends an undergraduate year to buy an ' A' category textbook priced, \u00a37.50 in the Bookshop supports the College with around\n\u00a3 0 0 -In these days of severe\nfinancial difficulties it is\nthere lb re of vital importance\n\u2022that everyone who will be\ngiving a lecture course during\nthe academic year gives the\nBookshop the chance to\nsupply the \"recommended\"\ntextbooks.\nTo enable us to do this, it is\nof the utmost importance that\nwe know what books you will\nbe recommending before the\ncourse starts, not as is happening now, telling us after the\ncourse has started. This is not\nfair to your students or to the\nBookshop. We try very hard\nto stock all recommended books, but we can only do it\nwith your help.\nRoy Hicks\nBookshop Manager\nDear Mark\nI would like to draw a small\nmatter to the attention of the\nstudent populace of IC. So\nhere goes\nDid you know that the\nUnion has been allocated approx \u00a3150 to buy fiction\nworks and magazines for the\nHaldane Librarv? I repeat,\n^750 of YOUR MONEY to\nbuy books for YOUR pleasure and perusal. So, if you\nwant to read the latest international bestselling blockbuster or something more literary such as \" My Friend, Mr Leakey\" (Barney\nMcCabe's favourite) without\nhaving to shell out for it, then\nthis is what you do. Either fill\nin a request form in the\nHaldane Library or drop a note into my pigeonhole. I await your requests with interest.\nTours hopefully\nAlun Griffiths\nChe mEng3 Dear Sir\nI'd like to make a few-observations about last week's 'Soapbox' article.\nFrankly, it seems to me that\nFrank James is contradicting\nhimself. He accuses the\nCreationists of meg lo mania( though for the life of me I can't see why!) and of in tolerance of deviation and pluralism of belief; and yet,\nwhile he grants the right of\nfree belief to all, he strongly\nobjects to the Creationists daring to state their unorthodox views.\nAs to the absurdity of such\nideas: has it ever occurred to\nhim to wonder why the\nbiblical order of Creation( Genesis 1 vs 1-26) is exactly\nthe same as the order of\nevolution of life that he holds\nas true? Remembering that\nthe Hebrew for 'day' may also\nbe translated 'age', and that\nthe Bible was never written as\na science textbook, the similarity is really quite remark-able.\nOf course, if such views are\nso absurd why suppress them,\nsince suppression will only\nstrengthen them. Why not\ngive the Creationists their say,\nsince surely noone will believe them.\nA point worth noting is tha:\nDarwin is probably not\nrevolving in his pine box. He was a Christian, and said\nhimself that he saw no reason\nwh v his theories should disturb a Christian's view-point, and I agree with him.\nFrank James may like to\nchoose to be an animal; but I believe that God made me,\nand that's really something to\nbe proud of.\n} ours\nL. Mercer\nDear Mark\nAmazingly I have just discovered an anagram for\nNick Morton that I am sure\nnobody else has noticed: Rector's doormat.\nAs you can clearly see it is\nonly a round dozen letters\nout.\nTours\nMichelle Wright\nChe mEng2 Dear Sir\nThe Wisden-like recall of\ngreat IC cricket events by\nKen Weale ( FELIX, Oct 23\n1981) should be extended in\nthe style of other noteworthy\nstatisticians such as Bill Frindall. Weale is correct in\nstating that Dwarf, Gnome\nand Stumpy Chimp have\nscored centuries on the Devon\ntour. But can he actually be\nunaware that of these elfin\nbatsmen one, Gnome, performed the feat twice \u2014 in successive innings? Surely a detail of immense significance.\nShould any aspiring centurion believe that the necessary\nprerequisite is to have acquired a similarly picturesque\nappellation, he will be discouraged to learn that in an\nera even more lost in the mists\nof time than that of Dwarf and Gnome, the magic score\nwas achieved by someone\nwith the lacklustre name of\nBland. Wisden' Weale will\ncorrect me if I am wrong.\nContinued on page 4\nPage 2 FELIX, January 22, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "Cutter's Way, Gate Notting Hill, X A description eludes me at present but the plot\nin its most basic (and perhaps incorrect) form\nis fairly simple: A rich and powerful magnate,\nJ. Cord murders a young cheerleader and it\nseems that he will get away with the crime\nbecause the only witness, Richard Bone, is\nalmost fatally apathetic. Bone has a friend,\nAlex Cutter, a Vietnamese war veteran who is\nheavily mutilated and seems to have one bodily\norgan where most people have two, and it is\nthis young man who makes for the vitality of\nthe film. By hook or by crook (the latter as it\nturns out) Cutter intends to get Cord for his\ndeed just like The Mounties always do. It is\nvery difficult to decide as to whether it is or is\nnot worth seeing since most of the few people\nwho have seen it like it, but I didn't. It was not as entertaining as Raiders nor\nas morally depressing as Christiane F. It is not\n\"light\", although it does have some amusing\nscenes, but then so do a lot of B movies.\nShezi Abedi John Heard as the horribly disfigured Cutter\nTranslations. A new play by Brian Friel.\nDirected by Donald McWhinnie. The\nLyttelton, National Theatre.\nA Ledge school in the year 1833 in the\ntown land of Braile Beag (Ballybeg), an Irishspeaking community in County Donegal, sets\nthe scene for the play Translations by the\ncontemporary Irish playwright Brian Friel. A hedge school, I was interested to find out, was\na place such as a barn or a loft where peasants\nstudied in the evening after a hard day's toil on\nthe land. They were taught by men drawn from\ntheir own stock and they often attained a high\ndegree of proficiency in such unlikely subjects\nas the classics. Learning was done entirely\nthrough the vernacular Gaelic.\n-Against this somewhat inconspicuous scene\na military deputation from the British government is stalking the countryside an gli c ising all the place names for the first\nOrdinance Survey of Ireland, and all this at a time when the hedge schools and the Gaelic\nlanguage they were keeping alive were being\nabsorbed into the recently introduced State\nsystem of education with English as the first\nlanguage.\nOn a superficial level the play is depicting a national and rustic way of life being wasted\naway by a temporal and political tide, and the\ntense relationship between the English and the\nIrish depicted in the play set almost 150 years\nago is still sadly relevant today. But the\nunderlying substance of the play is more\nuniversal and meaningful. Friel is building onto\nthe fabric of hedge schools and the Ordinance\nSurvey a masterful and beautiful exposition of\nlanguage\u2014both on the aesthetic and uplifting\nheights it can reach, but also on the frustration\nand even danger it can engender. These qualities of language are expressed beautifully\nin the play. An old, grey bearded peasant\nbecomes enraptured by Virgil. A dumb girl is\ntaught to say her name. The school master\ndelights in the Latin roots of Gaelic words. An English officer an gli c is es place names, but\nobliterates whole local legends in the process.\nAnd a peasant girl and an officer in love with\neach other can no more than embrace. All\nthese qualities and others are expressed in the\nplay in a dialogue of words which in themselves\nI found incredibly moving, heart-warming and\nincredibly beautiful. Even the acting was\nsuperlative.\nThe play was first staged on a tour of Ireland\nlast year but later appeared at the highly\nenterprising Hampstead Theatre where it was\ngreeted in The Times as a national classic. The\ndirector of the theatre upon reading the play\nsaid \"It was the sort of script you read once\nevery ten years if you are lucky\". The play is\ncertainly in a class of its own.\nNick Bedding\nStill Crazy The Bush (Shepherds Bush\nGreen). Presented by Bush Theatre Hull\ntruck. Runs until January 30.\nA play that trails through the swirling mi sap pre he os ions, assumptions and personal\nfall of those young in the sixties and their\ninability to come to terms with the notion that\nthey corrupted and betrayed the ideals of their\nnebulous twenties. Nick, who works for the\nBBC, and Libby, who brings up a child,\nattempt to unravel the eighties in clich es two\ndecades too late.\nThe play invokes the characters' guilt at the\nideals of youth, modified by middle class\naspirations, eventually degenerating into semi-detached homo geni ty. Whole food yogurt\nprovides the final, media-cultivated, corrupt\ntouchstone for those immersed in being forty\nwhose slogans have dissipated in a spasm of\nconsumerism.\nNick sees himself in Maddie, a frayed 'new\nromantic', and Tyle, who flirts with punk, and\nseizes the opportunity of conflict as a justifiable method of making the problems of\nhis past physical. By applying them to another\nhe ignores them in himself. The essential\ntragedy of Nick is the realisation and personal is ation of guilt.\nNick and Tyle are both created and crippled\nby basically the same concerns. They understand each other and the nature of their\nconflict totally. In the last resort they are inter-changeable. They are both safe in the rut of\nthe relationship between them.\nNick is the horror of Tyle as in him Tyle can\nsee what he will become. Each character\nlingers over their own terror in the relentlessly\nHabitat-inspired set.\nThe two aging, sold-out hippies, Nick and\nLibby, are able to develop within the\nrestrictions of role while Tyle, the obligatory\npunk y/ Bowie clone, and Maddie, the greying\nnew romantic, solidity in rather crudely\nimposed limitations.\nNick muses on the brave new world of the\nsixties that has passed by and it becomes\napparent that he is no different to any old man\nbrooding on his youth. The final confrontation\nwith Tyle is both painful and funny as both are\na mockery of what they express.\nDavid Gill\nShaun Scott and Bernadette Shorrt in Brian Fiel's \"Translations''\nFELIX, January 22, 1982 Page 10\n\n"

By October\n1974 it was the weekly, free FELIX you now\nknow, having undergone several changes in\ncost, size and particularly editorial style.\nThe 1967/8 FELIX was approximately twice\nthe size of the one before but still managed to\naverage ten pages under three different\neditors. It was a year of in qu or at eUG Ms, bitter Council arguments and heralded the\nambivalent attitude of wanting more women at\nIC yet simultaneously begrudging them access\nto the Union Bar.

    "content": "\"Why I believe RCS is going to\nthe dogs\"\nby S.J. Marshall, ARCS\nThe centenary year of the Royal College of Science seems an opportune time to ponder on the\ndownward trend in the reputation of this once reputable institution to such an extent that Mr Dave Thompson, RCS Union President, finds it necessary to consume his own excrement in\nthe Union Bar as a celebration of this achievement. May I offer some of my own personal\nthoughts on the matter, writing as a proud Associate of the RCS who is losing that pride rapidly\non over viewing the recent actions of the RCS Union, supposedly representative of the RCS as\na whole. 1 shall attempt to show that they are not representative and deserve no support but\nonly the contempt of those who are.\nThe trouble seems to stem from the\nunhealthy relationship between the higher\nechelons of the RCS Union and those people\nknown collectively as the \"22 Club\". This club\nis a \"private\" organisation which is intended\nfor people who have made a contribution to\nthe RCS Union in social and athletic spheres;\nelected membership. At this stage I should\npoint out that I have absolutely no desire to be\ndisrespectful to older members of the 22 Club,\nor indeed to some current student members; I am sure that they would not condone the foul\nacts of the few, in particular, Mr Dave Thompson, who I believe, as RCS Union\nPresident has acted outside the normal decorum afforded to such a noble position\nwithin the structure of the RCS. The 22 Club is not above public comment\nbecause it is a \"private club\"; its constitution\nmakes it an integral part of the RCS. It seeks\nto elect \"worthy\" members of the RCS and in\nso doing becomes representative of the RCS. It is unfortunate that the only tangible representations of the Royal College of\nScience, which excels in academic excellence,\nshould be the RCS Union heir arch y and the 22\nClub. Members of these organisations do not\nexcel academically because they are too busy\nexcelling at vomiting out of windows onto\npassers-by and consuming faeces in public.\nThis is a recent trend; a pity it should have\nreached such an unseemly climax in the year\nof the College's centenary, in fact the very\nweek!\nIf I lacked knowledge of the glorious history\nof the RCS and of its achievements in its one\nhundred years of existence and had only the\nRCS Union and 22 Club to look up to, I should\ncertainly not want to sustain any connection\nupon graduation; membership of the RCS Association is dwindling because it is\nunfortunately tarred by the same brush. Similarly, 1 could not feel proud to write the\nletters A.R.C.S. after my name. Luckily, I came to the RCS when the Union had leadership worthy of the college's reputation,\nstill socially orientated of course, but in an\namicable way; the union was united. Excesses, if indulged at all, were indulged in\nprivate. I would be happy for Mr Thompson to\nconsume bucketfuls of shit in the privacy of his\nown sty, but not in public in the week of the\nCentenary celebrations, the organisation of\nwhich he had shown minimal inter st. That is\nout of order.\nI believe this year's RCS fresher has been\nactively discouraged from showing any interest\nin the college's past history by these unceasing\ndiscreditable acts, presumably intended to\nimpress, coupled with narrative from this years\nRCS Union Officers, who are surely the most\nslow-witted, shallow and uninspiring bunch of\nmorons to emerge into the limelight in my four\nyears' personal knowledge of the RCS. I believe Mr Thompson is a quite genuine\nperson who believes he is working towards a great surge in the popularity of the RCS Union. But he is labour ing under the massive\nmisconception that his sole co prop h ago us contribution to the Centenary celebrations was\na great thing. I feel fresher s will not have\nreturned home this Christmas to tell their\nparents: \"Hey. RCS is a really great place, they\neat their own shit.\" Unfortunately, neither will\nthey have told their parents of the great men\nwho owe their greatness to the RCS, from T.H. Huxley and H.G. Wells of yesteryear to the\nnobel laureates of today. And this was simply\nbecause they took little interest in the\nCentenary and unfortunately missed out on an excellent opportunity to delve into history. It\nwas handed to them on a platter but Mr Thompson and his un savoury friends had\nalready seen to it that their first impressions\nwere the wrong ones.\nEncouragement for Mr Thompson emanates\nfrom the bowels of the 22 Club, an organisation\nthat has enough collective experience to know\nbetter. The very thing that the club was set up in\n1922 to safeguard, that is the preservation of\nsocial wellbeing within the RCS( from a respectable distance) is now being destroyed by\nthe mentally impoverished minority presently\nbeing deemed \"worthy\" of membership.\nIn the same way as decent members of the 22\nClub are degraded and tarnished by the acts of\nthe few, so too are ALL members of the RCS, those \"not privileged\" to be singled out as\nofficial representatives, but who nevertheless\nhave the right to be proud of their college, and\nits history.\nSense has not even permeated into the one\nmember of the RCS Union team who might\nhave been thought to possess it, namely Dr\nChris Bruton, Life Sciences lecturer, Senior\nTreasurer of the RCS Union (and member of\n22 Club). When I interviewed him on his\nthoughts about the future of the RCS, with\nparticular reference to Mr Dave Thompson, he\nshowed what a fine judge of character he was.\nHe said that Mr Thompson was \" a very nice\nchap\". But perhaps Dr Bruton was just\ntreading carefully, as he later admitted to'\nthinking he was \"as thick as two short planks\".\nIn summation, what RCS students must\nnever forget is that to be an Associate of the\nRoyal College of Science( A.R.C.S.) is\nsomething to be proud of. We must never\nallow the rubbish people who strut around in\nthe name of the RCS to take that away from\nus. In a nutshell, it simply means that the ones\nwho really are representative of the RCS must\nnot allow themselves to be conned by the\nintellectually inept few who believe they are the\nchosen race.\nFully Guaranteed\n1\nV1ENI E) BH CH MEND A BIKE1315 Park Walk, London SW10\n01-352-3999\nNew and Used Cycles\nSAME DAY REPAIR SERVICE\nWe've got some great bicycle bargains!\nNew: 5 - speeds British Eagle usually \u00a378 now \u00a370.\nClipper Lux us Sport usually \u00a379 now \u00a372.\nNew: 1 0 - speeds British Eagle usually \u00a392 now \u00a380.\nLux us Sport usually \u00a388 now \u00a378.\nPeugeot U01010 speeds alloy wheels, cotter less chain sets, etc., usually \u00a3145 now \u00a3124.\nFor the short distance cyclist secondhand small wheel cycles between \u00a320 and \u00a330.\nLimited number of ex rental cycles \u00a349.00.\nTrade-ins accepted, also credit facilities available.\nFELIX.

(FELIX\nEditor, a more delicate issue altogether, will be\nreserved for a later puzzle.)\nAs far as his job is concerned, an Exec\nmember should be dedicated, enthusiastic and\nversatile. Personal qualities are essential too:\ncheerfulness, friendliness and wit are all\nimportant qualities in a Union Officer. INo one\ncould consider himself suitable for an Exec\npost unless he was blessed with at least two of\nthe industrious qualities I have mentioned, and\nat least two of the personal qualities. In fact,\nfor a balanced Exec, each feature should be\nfound in just two of the three members.\nThe President, of course, needs to be witty.\nThe Deputy President, who must be versatile,\nshould be enthusiastic or witty, but not both.\nAnd the Exec should not contain more than\none person who is both dedicated and witty,\nnor should there be more than one member\nwho is cheerful and enthusiastic.\nWhat qualities are required in the Hon Sec?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office, please. There is a prize of \u00a35\n(donated by Mend-a Bike) for the correct\nentry randomly selected at 1:00pm on\nWednesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nMcOatup'sc aber has four perforations, and\nthere are three possible arrangements for\nthem along the length of the pole: 1+1+4+4+3\nor 1+3+1+6+2 or 1+5+3+2+2. Of the thirteen\npeople who found one or more of these, A. Shiekh, Physics 2, is the lucky winner.\nAnd now, the rest of the solutions to the\nChristmas puzzles.\nCall My Bluff\nan gek kok, mono tr och, mono st ich, pane it y, gia our, st, g ju and eu oi are all in Chambers'\nDictionary, and are perfectly acceptable in\nScrabble. Euoi, st and g ju are even useful on\noccasion. Posteeen is in the dictionary, and I suppose that makes it permissible, even though\nit is a misprint; it should read 'post een'. Nunatakkr is another misprint (should be\n' nun a tak ker') but this one is definitely\ndisallowed, since it is marked as Swedish.\nFinally,' swede' is not allowed since, Bert Schnick (Barry Humphries), the blind\nhost of a marriage counselling show. He convinces Janet to send Brad for treatment in\nDenton vale,a medical series run by the\nsuspect duo Cosmo and Nation McKinley.\nMeanwhile, unknown to both lovers, evil fast\nfood king Farley Flavors is plotting to make\nJanet a star and steal her from Brad to settle\nan old score.\nJessica Harper is well cast as Janet (as is the\namazing Barry Humphries as Schnick). She\nproves that she has a fine voice in the musical\nnumbers and also manages to always look\nentirely convincing. The film moves at a rapid\npace which can be confusing, but the variety of\nimages and the catchy lyrics holds the\nattention well. As a musical it is not perfect,\nbut it displays an inventiveness and wit which\nis all too rare nowadays.\nMark Smith\nrather surprisingly, it does not appear in\nChambers without a capital letter.\nMarches Two solutions are shown in the diagram.\nTaking Notes\nWriting ' U' for 'up', ' D' for 'down', etc.,the\nfollowing solution takes 83 moves.

For full review see back page.\nThe interview will be broadcast by STOIC on Tuesday at\n1:00pm and 6:00pm. The security of the Southside Halls of Residence has still not\nbeen adequately improved following the rape which occurred\nthere over one and a half years ago and numerous thefts. A new system of electronic locks has not yet been installed,\ndespite indications from the Estates section that they would\ndo so over the Christmas vacation.\nFollowing a rape in the basement of Southside in May1980 it was\ndecided that access to the halls was too easy and that a new system of\nlocks should be installed. The main problem was lire doors would have\nto be locked, so an electronic system was necessary with locks linked to\nthe fire alarm system which would automatically open if a fire broke out.\nA system was suggested and a quotation obtained. This proved \"too\nexpensive\" and was shelved when major structural changes were proposed to combat the same problem.\nA less expensive system was investigated last year which, at a cost of\napproximately/'3,500, would adequately do the job. The Chief Security\nOfficer, Mr Reeves, persuaded Estates that this system would be needed\nif the structural changes went ahead or not.\nUnion Pressure Last term the Union President. Mr Nick Morton, and Welfare\nOfficer. Mr Nick Pyne, pressed Estates for an installation date on\nStudent Residence Committee. The indication was clearly given that\nthis would be done over the Christmas vacation, but it was not.\nMr Don Clarke, Estates Secretary, told FELIX that he did not know\nwhy the system had not been installed. \" Most of my people are out\ntoday,\" he said, \"the rail strike, you know.\"\nThe reason for the delay is still not clear at the time of going to press.\nQE C Merger\nOff!\nThe proposed merger between Imperial College and Queen\nElizabeth College has been shelved for the time being.\nAt the end of last term the draft proposal horn Lord Flowers and Dr Barnes (Principal of QE C) was amended by IC's Board ol Studies. This\namended draft proposal was submitted to the Governing Body and\npassed. Alter such changes it was not surprising that the new proposals\nproved unacceptable to the Academic Board and College Council of\nQE C. The Rector, Lord Flowers, told FELIX that as far as he was\nconcerned \"the door is still open \" and that negotiations could still\ncontinue. It seems, however, that it is up to QE C to re-approach IC.\nNo. 602 Friday January22,1982 Free!\n\n"

You may like to explain to members of Imperial College Union the background to the newspaper stories about Princess Anne's recent visit to Nepal. Her Royal Highness did indeed visit a Game Reserve where strenuous efforts are being made to preserve the tiger population. This part of The Princess' s visit organised by the Nepalese Government was to see the local wildlife including, if possible, one of the small number of tigers. Buffaloes also live in the Reserve( together with other species being the natural prey of tigers) and are maintained there by the Reserve authorities as a matter of policy. If there was no Reserve the natural habitat of the tiger and its food sources would have already disappeared in Nepal( and hence tigers). There is not ruthin the story that one beast was specially staked for the benefit of Princess Anne, nor did she see a buffalo killed.4 aMa^ti rN S?

    "content": "ISLAMIC WEEK\nThe Creator and His Creation 1\nTheory\nIt has only been In the last\nhundred or so years that scientists have been able to the or is e with any authority about the\norigins of the earth and life on It.\nThat Is, In effect, only \"y ester day\", If the history of mankind Is\nthought of as having spanned a single year.\nAnd their discoveries have\nrevolutionized Western man's conceptions\u2014so that he is no\nlonger in awe of the untamed\nnatural world around him, and is\neven sceptical as to existence of a Supreme Being. Thus he considers it unnecessary to submit\nhimself to the will of God (except\nin a most limited and perfunctory\nway on a Sunday). For all the\nearth's greatest mysteries have\nbeen reduced by the scientists to\na material\u2014rational cause and\neffect which neutralizes the\nnecessity to submit oneself in\nfear and hope to any divinity.\nReasoning\nWe Muslims believe, and can\nprove using the valued \"reason-ing\" employed by the sciences,\nthat Western man's complacency\nwith regard to the Supreme\nBeing, God, is based upon a complete misinterpretation of the\nfacts about the universe which\nhave been discovered. Furthermore, it is due to the unwarranted\negoism which resulted from the\nadvances in scientific knowledge.\nIf one were to ask a scientist to\nopine about how our universe,\nour earth and the life upon it\ncame into being; his answer\nwould be that the consensus of\nopinion has it as follows:\nBillion BC\n\"Billions of years ago our universe\nwas a single piece of matter,\nthere was then a Big Bang in the\ncentre of this lump: the result of\nwhich was that a lot of energy\nwas produced. This coagulated\ninto the stars, which then themselves gave birth to the heavier\nelements. Thus our solar system\ncame into being as well as other\ngalaxies. Since there was no\nresistance in space to that\nprimordial momentum generated\nby the explosion, the stars and\nthe planets remained in regular\norbits.\"\nNote the materialist cause and\neffect that excludes the notion of\nSupreme Being or Creator or\nGod.\nBiology\nSimilarly, if we were to ask the\nbiologists about the origins of life\non earth, he would reply that the\nlatest scientific techniques have\nenabled scientists to hypothesis e with some authority that all life\nevolved from water. Thus (to>\npre c is the most consist ant ly expounded theory): In the young\nprimeval atmosphere of the\nearth there were a lot of elements\nlike carbon, oxygen and nitrogen\nfloating about along with a tremendous amount of electrical\nactivity. It is thought that the\ncombination of these with the\n\"Primeval Soup\" lying around the\nrocks and oceans of the young\nearth, produced ii fe; the primeval\nmatter in the sea generating the\nprotoplasm out of which came\nthe amoeba and then all living\nthings.\nBoth theories: of the origin of\nthe universe and origin of life on\nthe earth are regarded as scientific \"fact\" in the West, and indeed\nis taught as such in schools. The\nbiblical account of creation in\nGenesis is considered a myth and\nthe onus is on the believers in\nGod to prove the rationality of\ntheir faith\u2014something they have\nhitherto failed to do.\nIn Islam there is no dichotomy\nbetween faith and reason; thus to\nus it seems that the scientists of\nthe West have not in the past\nhundred or so years discovered\nanything new about the universe\nthat undermines a belief in God,\nin fact it is just the opposite; they\nhave at this late stage merely\nconfirmed what God revealed of\nhis creation to mankind 1400\nyears ago.\nHow? Well, if one was to ask\nthe astronomers who know so\nmuch about the universe's origins\nwhether it would have been\npossible for an illiterate Arab\nliving over 1400 years ago in the\nArabian Desert to know his\nscientific facts about the universe,\nhe would retort in the negative\nwith some vehemence. Yet look\nat what Muhammed (peace be\nupon him), born in 570AD was\nsaying under the inspiration of\nGod:\n\"Do not the Unbelievers (a e theists and agnostics) see,\nThat the Heavens and the Earth\nWere joined together (as one unit\nof creation)\nBefore we clove them asunder.\"\n(from the Koran/the Prophets)\nand:\n\"And it is He (God) who created,\nthe Night and the Day,\nthe Sun and the Moon\nAll move along; each in its orbit.\"\n(from Koran/The Prophets)\nAnd again, with regard to the\norigins of life on the earth, the\nbiologists whose theories about\nthe origins of life are regarded as\nfact, would not credit it that someone living over 1400 years ago\nwould know what he knows only\nnow; yet Muhammed (upon\nwhom be peace) said under the\ninspiration of God:\n\"And We made from water\nEvery living thing\nWill they then not believe?\"\n(Koran/Prophets)\nand:\n\"O Mankind\nIf you are in doubt concerning\nthe Resurrection,\nWe created you from dust\nthen from a drop of seed\nthen from a clot\nthen from a i it tle lump of flesh,\nshapely and shapeless\nthat we may make it clear for you\nAnd We cause what We will to\nremain\nIn the womb for an appointed\ntime.\"\n(Koran/The Pilgrimage)\nThus we can see that scientists,\nhave at this late stage merely\nconfirmed what God revealed of\nhis creation to man all those 1400\nyears ago. Thus there is no\nwarrant for the scepticism about\na divinity brought on in the West\nby these scientific theories rather\nthan the logical conclusion to be\ndrawn from the theories is that\nAuthor and Prime Mover of the\nBig Bang and the Water from\nwhich we came into being is\nworthy of our submission and\npraise. For otherwise we would\nhave to accept the preposterous\nimplications of the scientists'\ntheories: that random Chance\nOperation was the lynchpin that\ninstigated our universe.\n\"Life\" whatever your opinion of\nit, must be self-replicating\u2014be\nable to reproduce itself over and ,\nover again. DNA is the basis of\nlife and is an incredibly complicated structure, a double helix\nwith millions of atoms arranged\nin a special code of four letters.\nConsider the complexities of\nDNA' s self-replication \u2014 un winding, its intricate form to\ndivide into two seperate individuals which then each find exact\nreplicas to attach themselves to\nin what has been called a \"zipping\nup\" operation. This being possible because there was a yet\nmore infinitesimally intricate\nprocess at work, instigated by the\ncatalyst enzymes acting as a\" bio machine\" for the DNA. So\nintricate and infinitely complex\nare the forces at the basis of\nlife\u2014yet we are asked this was\nthe product of a random process,\nwithout external inspiration!\nIt is not an exaggeration to say\nthat it is like being asked to\naccept that a tornado blowing\nthrough a scrap yard could produce a typewriter in whose\ncarriage was a full instruction\nsheet describing how to make\nanother typewriter. And not only\nthat but the tornado produced all\nthe tools essential to make that\ntypewriter!!\nSurely this is too improbable\nand has to be dismissed. Then\nthere is the Sir Fred Hoyle theory\nthat evolution commenced in\ndeep space and then genes\nshowered onto the earth mixed\nwith the primeval soup to start\nlife. Sir Fred claims that a super\nintelligent computer in deep\nspace planning, executing and\ncontrolling all life. If that is so\nwho designed and made that\ncomputer in deep space. For a Muslim the answer is easy, it\nis\n\"God there is no God but He, the\nliving, the self-subsisting eternal.\nNo slumber can cease Him nor\nsleep. His are all things in the\nHeavens and the Earth. None can\nintercede in His presence except\nas He wills. He knows what\nappears to His creatures in the\npast, present and future. None\ncan encompass. His knowledge\nexcept as He wills. His throne\ndoes extend over the Heavens\nand the Earth and He feels no\nfatigue in guarding and preserving it, for He is the most High,\nthe Supreme in Glory.\nAl-Koran (ll;255)\nISLAMIC WEEK PROGRAMME OF EVENTS Monday, January 25\nIntroductory Talk on Islam, 6:00pm, ME542.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Ik Tuesday, January 26\nThe Brandt Report: An Islamic Perspective, 1:15, 542.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 it* Wednesday, January 27\nBookstall, JC R,1:002:30pm.

    "content": "IC\" Union is shortly to make a television programme for the\nBBC2 Open Door series. Following an unexpected phone call last\nterm. Union President Nick Mori on yesterday met the producer lo discuss the matter.\nThis ended a period ol silence on\nthe par i of Auntie Beeh; two\nyears have passed since the then\nHon Secretary Roger Stotesbury\nsubmitted the application.\nOpen Door will allow students\nhere to make a programme about\nvirtually anything. A film crew\nand studio facilities are to be\nused, with the BBC paying the\nbill. Seemingly, neither the\ncontent nor the style of the\nprogramme have definitely been\ndecided yet.\nOnlv six weeks between the\ndate of notification and the\nactual transmission is given by\nOpen Door. So IC should be\nbroadcasting to the nation at\nsome time this term.\nMedia\nEvening\nOn Monday evening IC Union Publications Board hosted the\nInst ever \" Media Evening\". The event, held in the College\nTV Studios, included displays by\nFELIX, It: Radio, The Phoenix.\nAlternative Prospectus and STOICS Members of the College\nadministrative stall'were invited,\nincluding Lord and Lady Flowers. The intention was to\ngive these people a chance to\nmeet the students who work on\nthe College media.\nIi was generally felt that the\nevening was a great success.\nLectures to\ncease?\nThere is a possibility that the\nTuesday lunchtime Humanities\nlecture programme will be\nsuspended for the next session.\nThe Humanities Committee\nhas been asked by College to\nsubmit a plan for a twenty per\ncent reduction in expenditure\nover a three year period. The plan includes suspension of the\nTuesday lunchtime lectures and\na reduction in language classes.\nHowever, I he plans have not\nyet been implemented and may\nbe avoided, if possible.\nNuclear War\nBeginning at the END\nLast Tuesday lunchtime, a crowd of about 200 gathered to hear\nProfessor Robert Neild, Prof of Economics, Cambridge\nUniversity give the first of a series of lunchtime lectures under\nthe title 'Nuclear War in Europe'.\nProf Neil d began by recalling the recent rise of interest in nuclear\ndisarmament due lo the non-ratification of SALT2, the planned\ninstallation of Cruise missiles in Europe, the Soviet invasion of\nAfghanistan, and the election of President Reagan.\nWhen NATO was originally formed in 1949 there was a big\nimbalance in conventional forces between the still heavily armed\nSoviet Union and the economically weak Western European states, the\nidea being that American nuclear forces would compensate lor this\nwith massive 'retaliation' in the event of Russian invasion of Western\nEurope. Since then, the United States has lost its nuclear dominance,'\nand smaller, tactical nuclear weapons have been developed\u2014both\nlac tors leading to the possibility that Europe would be sacrificed using\nsuch devices rather than the US mounting 'massive retaliation'.\nRussian threat There are two views of the Russian threat, according to the\ni roles s or. One is the ' Islamic' viewpoint \u2014 that the Russians continually want to expand by invasion, and the other the 'ripe fruit'\ntheory\u2014that the Russians wait for capitalist collapse and revolution to\nbring Communist governments to power, which can then be \"helped\"\nby intervention. The 'ripe fruit' theory, he said, is the more accurate,\napart from the case of E. Europe, which was occupied during WW2\nand is now a buffer zone against the West. In fact, the situation is\nrather reassuring in W. Europe, since these countries are prope rous, and there is little chance of Communist revolution. But in E. Europe,\ncentral planning and oppression has failed, leading Prof Neild to\nconclude that the Soviet forces there are lor garrison purposes against\nlocal revolt rather than for offensive anti-Western reasons. The only\nchance of the US and the Soviet Union coming to blows is over \"Third\nWorld involvement\u2014but even this would tend to be at arms length. Comparing the policies of deterrence and defence, he saw deterrence as\nbeing analogous to arming yourself with a sword, to frighten your\nopponent, and thus provoking him to arm himself Purely defensive\npolicies (as practised by Switzerland and Sweden, say) he saw as a shield, without threat to anyone but an invader, and this not sparking\nan arms race.\nNext Tuesday, Field Marshall the Lord Carver, is lo talk on\n\" Nuclear Weapons in Europe\" as the next part of this series.\nReactor\nfusion\nwith IC?\nThe third discussion document\npublished this week by the\nUniversities Committee on Academic Organisation otherwise known as the SwinnertonDver Com mh tee recommends\nthat the University of London Reactor Centre( UL RC) at\nSil wood Park should become part of Imperial College.\nThe committee, after looking\nat possible rationalization of\ncolleges in its first two discussion\ndocuments, has now examined\nthe central activities of the\nuniversity. These include UL RC. the Senate Institutes, the central\nlibrary facilities, UL U and the\ncentral administration, amongst\nother things.\nIn the case of the reactor centre which is already managed\nand mainly used by IC:, the\nsuggestion is for IC1\n. to take over\nthe centre entirely, receiving extra grant to cover running costs. It is hoped that costs could\nbe reduced by selling services to\noutside users. The current cost of\n,\u00a3220.000 per year could, it is\nsuggested, be 50% covered by\nsuch income.\nPraise for UL U ICON stops production\nEditorial Board decides\nThe Editorial Board of ICON, the Imperial College Review,\nhave decided to suspend publica-tion indefinitely due to the\ncurrent financial situation.\nIn the last issue, which will be\npublished on February 5, they\nstate that they no longer feel that\nthey are justified in asking for a subsidy from College funds and\nthat the decision was entirely\ntheirs. They were not forced to\ncease publication by pressures\nfrom College, they state.\nThe last issue contains, amongst other things, reviews of\nthe Alfred La mmer print display\nin the Consort Gallery, the RCS Centenary Concert given by IC Orchestra, the Operatic Society\nperformance at Saint James' Church, Piccadilly and the IC Choir Christmas Concert.\nThe section on student facilities is full of praise for the\nUniversity of London Union( UL U). After mentioning the\npart played by UL U in representing students on the Senate, ii\nexamines the trading activities.\nThe conclusion is \" The Union building seems to us one of the\nmost efficient and economical\ninstitutions in the University.\" Thus no further cuts are recommended for UL U. The document is also very\ncomplimentary to IC, whilst justifying the direct UGC funding, which the College alone\nin the University enjoys. \" For a generation it has been national\npolicy to buildup Imperial College to be one of the foremost\nscientific and technological institutions in the world\u2014to be\nBritain's counterpart to MIT.\" And, in the words of Lord Wi1 ber force,\" The nation, having willed the end, must will\nthe means.\"\nCopies of the discussion document are available for\ninspection in the IC Union Office.\nFELIX, January 22, 1982\n\n"

No.315 referred to the first election saying \"Abstain\".\n\" And They Did\" being the headline of no. 316.\nBack to Front\nHowever, not everything followed in a logical sequence: in no. 314 under the title\n\"Porn: A Communist Plot\" was a photo of the\nstripper of 301 before removing her bra, while\nno. 315 showed shots of Motor Show models\nfrom various illuminating angles. Copies of\nthese four photos will be on view in the FELIX\nOffice for a nominal charge during this week.\nThe front page of no. 336 had a\" FELIX Editor Threatened with Castration\" (by Union\nSec for leaking election results) caption, but\nmuch more seriously were the events reported\non the cover of no. 337: \"Where are our Rag\nMags? , FELIX Ed Censured\u2014But Resignation Bid Fails\". This described the blunders\nmade by Dowson in having Mike Williams' Rag\nMags printed. Council had made Dowson print\na letter from Williams on the front page,\nalthough in the accompanying report no\nelaboration was given on how P. Jowitt\n(Deputy President) had succeeded in dragging\nnumerous parts of Mr Dowson's private life\ninto the argument. Williams was later to follow\nDowson as FELIX Editor. This issue also\nincluded the following insert about an\nImprobable College.\nIn his epilogue Oily answered criticisms of\nhis FELIX by stating news was up to 25%,\nadding that the following Editor planned more,\nsuggested UG Ms be named Socsoc meetings\n( remarking how Socs oc no longer held meetings of their own) and claimed CC Us were destroying ICU. The1973/4 session FELICE S were dominated by Union news, the reason being A. Campbell's resolution to increase news content and his replacement by P. Wadsworth\nwho was both FELIX Editor and Hon Sec for\ntwo of the three terms of the session.\nWadsworth, in his 358 editorial, explained he\nonly wrote editorials when he ran out of copy\nand criticised several of his staff for being\nbiased. The session ended with D P,D. Sinclair, resigning his post near the end of his\nterm in office because he had not been\nawarded aUG A. During this time IC played host to many big\nname bands and solo acts, either in the Great\nHall or in Carnival gigs held at outside venues\nlike the Albert Hall. These included Deep\nPurple, Donovan (a real money-spinner), Elton\nJohn, Queen and Lou Reed. This last gig\ncoinciding with a pick-up in the drug scene.\nThis week's advert is for the first of two Pink\nFloyd gigs at IC.\nscandalous\nFELIX 337\nFELIX, January 22, 1982 Page 7\n\n"
