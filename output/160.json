The journey passed quickly, the only notable diversion being caused when Rushton stopped\nthe oo ach to explore a field and found an\nancient porcelain bowl of doubtful origin.\nWe were uncertain as whether or not\nEnglish was spoken as far a south as\nSouthamptonville, and it was intrepid ex-plo rer drummer-president Mike Smith who\nwas first to alight, as he is multilingual\n(i.e., he can say \"Like crazy, Dad\" in\nfourteen languages). On the suggestion of\nStan Salmons, he came back for some\nbeads, but the natives proved to be quite\nfriendly and these were not needed. The\nnative dwellings were constructed entirely of red cuboids, this building material lending them their unique aspect.\nNeither was there any form of heating in\ntheir habitations, so the natives must be\nquite hardy. After a simple meal, we adjourned to a nearby establishment where\nwe enjoyed the native drink \"Red\nBarrel\".\nThus fortified, we prepared for the\nmain business of the evening, which was\nto be a comparison of the relative merits\nof the music of both native and visiting\ntribes, viz. the Inter-University Jazz\nFederation Jazz-Band Semi-Finals. The\nmeeting was presided over by Big Chief\nBenny Green, of whom the natives say\n\"him face like Setting Sun\", and his\nWitch Doctor, Dill Jones ,of whom I.C. says \"him plenty tr ad.\", and was com-per ed by George Melly, of whom a lot\nof people say a lot of things. During the\nperformances, tribal dancing took place in\nadjoining rooms, and more familiar customs behind the stage.\nThe indigenous music was, as expected,\nmainly primitive'in form, since the local\ngods are King Oliver and Jelly Roll, but\n\"Group One\" was outstanding for its excitement and swing and took first place.\nIt comprised valve-trombone/trumpet, two\nmore trombones, clarinet, piano, guitar,\nbass and drums. Of the visiting tribes,\nOxford University's Jazz Band was undoubtedly the best. They were polished\nand very exciting, and the Hodges-style\nalto solos were a real pleasure to listen to.\nLine-up was trumpet, alto/clarinet, trom-bone, piano, bass and drums. They were\nplaced third bu ii deserved to win.\nThey received one of the best criticisms\nof the evening; Dill really slated everyone else. He talked of the \"neat piano\nand flute-playing\" and the \"polished and\nmusician ly sound\" of the group. \"But\",\nhe said, \"jazz content \u2014 rather small.\"\nHis definition of jazz is questionable.\nTo everyone's astonishment second place\nwas awarded to a trio from Reading. The\npianist was extremely good, but the solos\nwere obviously not spontaneous (from the\nway the drummer was phrasing with the\npianist) and if this constitutes jazz, Mr.\nJones' definition is highly questionable.-Whilst the judges were conferring,\nGeorge Melly sang us some suggestive\nsongs, and this was one of the high spots\nof a very entertaining evening.\nThe native drink probably has an accumulative effect, since the journey home\nwas a very lovely one. Judging by the\nhigh spirits, I.C. had won a moral victory if not a material one. To quote that\nlittle known sage Buskshot le Funky: \"A person should blow good that which he\nlikes to blow and dig good that which he\nlikes to dig.\" And that's what we did.\nCounterpoint\nExpedition\nReports\nThe following expedition reports have\nbeen deposited in the Haldane Library:\nIceland 1956; Arctic Norway 1957;\nGhana 1957 (Cargo section) ; Ghana 1958\n(Cargo section) ; Iceland 1958; Jan\nMeyen 1959; Apolobamba 1959; Spitsbergen 1960'; Africa and^Americas 1960.\nCopies of all but the first three are also\nrn the Lyon 3?lay fair Library.

Hill.\nWHY SOCIALISM 1\nby Dave Finney\nIn my last article I attempted to put\nboth the moral and corn m q n sense case for\nSocialism, my pr ft jn is e\\ being that man\nwill change if his environment is changed.\nI intend now to argue that any consequential change will only arise if changes\nare made at the crux of our social system\n\u2014 at the economic base.\nIt is often argued that no longer is there\na case for any radical change in the way\nwe conduct our economic affairs, and in\nsome circles to suggest public, as opposed\nto private ownership, arouses hoots of de-r is ion, This is quite un-justified, if only\nbecause if we take central and local government together with nationalised ind-us tries, public ownership accounts for two\nfifths of our investment spending and a quarter of the national product. Public\nownership is an essential part of our syst-em, and as such is doing excellent work\nin such spheres as education, nuclear energy and municipal housing. No one s ug gets that education should be put on the\nopen market and the thought of Mr.\nCotton bidding for I.C. does not bear\nthinking of.\nUnfortunately, not only is public ownership to be found in education, but it\nis also running the basic industries such\nas railways and coal at a loss and a great\nexpense to the tax payer. Why? Because\nboth the post-war Labour and Conservative Governments have allowed the pricing and investment policies of the nationalised industries, to be determined by, or\nvaried to suit, short term considerations\nin handling the economy. Essentially, the\ntendency for profit margins to widen in\nprivate mono polis ed industries has led the\nGovernment to hold down prices in nationalised industries so that private concerns\nmay still take high margins without causing too high an inflationary pressure,,\nBecause no margin is allowed, no account can be made of replacement depreciation. In a period of inflation cost is\nconsiderably higher at the end of the\nplant's life then at the beginning. In fact,\nin the 10 years between 1949 and 1958\nthe revenue of nationalised industries fell\nshort by JG1,295M. of what was needed\nmerely to provide for depreciation. Almost\nall of this had to be borrowed. Similarly\nall increases in capital equipment or stacks\nhad to-be borrowed, with the result that\nbetween 1949,- 58 the nationalised industries paid out \u00a31,419M. in interest I This\nmay please the moneylenders, but it is\nhardly the way to impress the public that\nstate industry is being run for the benefit of the community.\nOPERA\nby I.L. Gibson\nThat this has happened is not sur pris ing. As long as the private sector of the\neconomy remains dominant over the public sector, the short term profit motive will\nalways take precedent over desire for\nthe public good. No long term planning\nis possible and consequently the goods are\nusually in short supply, making necessary\nincreased imports which add further\nstrain to an already delicate balance of\npayments.\nIf public ownership \u2014 in a variety of\nforms \u2014 were made the dominant force\nin our economy, the above situation would\nbe reversed. A system of production for\nsocial needs could be established and a basis for sustained and balanced growth\nof the economy would exist. A remedy\nwould be found for Britain's shocking neglect of technical and social research, three\nquarters of which is either financed or\ncarried out by the state anyway. At present the money spent on technical research just equals that spent on advert-ising, while private profits accrue from\nthe selling, at negligible risk, of the products developed by the state at public ex-pens e. Only by making public ownership the\nking-pin of our economy can we establish\na much greater quality of income. Taxation is not enough; the need is to extinguish large, unearned and un taxed, capital gains which have their source in the\nprivate ownership of industry. Public ownership would mean that profits would be\ndiverted into public instead of private cof-fer s. Finally, only through a drastic change\nin property ownership will a move towards\ngreater democracy ever be made. The\ntrend under capitalism is towards mono-polis ation and thereby an irresponsible concentration of power. We need only to consider the disappearance of newspapers\nsince the war and how, as are s ulf, fewer\npeople control the minds of men and decide what we ought to think and know.\nAdvertising provides another example of\nhaw men's opinions are not asked for but\nmade. In the U.S. today there is 40 per\ncent overproduction of consumer goods, and\nif it were not for the good offices of the\ndepth-motivation ad. men the economy\nwould stagnate. Through them men and\nwomen buy things they don't need just\nbecause the profit motive dictates.\nPerhaps one day men will realise that\nit is more moral, more human, and obvious to co-operate rather than to compete in a wasteful, irrelevant way.\n\"With the Easter Vacation looming up\nfollowed by examinations for a fair proportion of the student body of Imperial\nCollege, it is perhaps rather an inopportune moment to extol e the virtues of London's resident opera companies. However, like many of the contributer s to\n\"Felix\", I can only entreat you, the average student, to make the most of your\nopportunities in College and support\nsome of London's many attractions in\nthe field of the Arts, whether they be in\nthe Cinema, Concert Hall, Theatre, or\nthe Opera House.\nFull details of the Summer season at\nCovent Garden are not yet available but\none of the highlights will almost certainly\nbe a new production of \"Falstaff\", with\nGeraint Evans in the title role. This is\nthe last opera that Verdi, a great lover\nof Shakespeare, ever wrote, and into it\nhe poured the experience of o v<?r.50y< wr\u00bb\nas sn opera composer. The resultant work\nis often considered to be his finest piece\nand is the composer's only successful\ncom ie opera. \"Falstiaff\" is to be produced\nby Franco Zeffirelli who was responsible\nfor the fine production of Paglacci and\nCavalleria Busticana.\nRigoletto is also to re-enter the repertoire after a lapse of some years. Newcomers to Italian opera would find the\n'action-packed' melodrama not far removed in style from Gilbert and Stallivan,\nalthough it must be admitted that the\nmusic is on far higher plane.

This year, on 24 April\nwe are to have the English premier\nof \"Volopone\" a new opera by Francis\nBurt as well as \"The Prisoner\" by\nDallapiccola and Bavel's\"L 'Heur Espagnole\".\nFROM THE RECTORS\nBULLETIN\nBuilding Progress.\nWork continues in the new building for\nCivil Engineering and the second instalment for Mechanical Engineering and on\nthe new Halls of v Residence in Princes's Gardens, although the contractors have-been hampered by the extremely wet\nweather of recent months.

In these series, sailed\nthroughout1 the two winter terms, the club\nhas also gained 3rd and 4th in the \"A\" and 2nd and 3rd in the \"B\" points. The\n\"A\" points was won by Graham Taylor,\nour oom m odore, in Fiasco F2168, by\ngaining 4 l st's and 2 2nd's.( The best\n\u2022even results are taken out of nine races).\nIn the last '-'A'' points race Graham was\nseen sailing backwards fast from the line\nat the start, while adjusting rigging; and\nfrom being lOO yards behind the fleet at\nthe start he caught up to 5th pla oe after\nthree laps.\nAfter sailing three successful races in\nthe \"B\" points in F2462 Fuff, Johr\nThewlis was made an \"A\" points helms\nman, and Nigel Hill ably took over Fuff\nto ensure victory in the \"B\" points.\nEarly in the term we had some very\nstrong winds oom pared to the calm of last\nwinter; but in the last two we lek s we\nhave had light to moderate winds, which\nhave given us some pleasant sailing. The\nCastaways' Cup races lor U.L. colleges and\nhospitals, were sailed in light weather.\nAs usual the Castaways' Hoodoo lay upon\nthe two Imperial College teams.

The Championship would be just a reward for the good\nfootball the first eleven have played this\nseason. Their consistency is illustrated\nby the fact that they have not lost a game this term. The second eleven should\nfinish third in Division I of U.L. league,\nbut stand a very good chance of winning\nthe cup against L.S.E. II. In order to\navoid relegation from Division I(R) the\nthird eleven must win their final game in\nthe league.\nThe fourth eleven unfortunately lost\ntheir vital league game against Goldsmith's seo on d eleven and other games\nmust be played off by their rivals before\nit can be seen whether or not they have\ngained promotion.\nwet sailors walked bao k into the club\nhouse shaking the ice off their o lot he s and\nwondering if it was worth it.

In blustery\nstrong winds and heavy rain we eventually got the boat B out; but as soon as\nthey left the pontoon, one mast broke,\ntwo boats capsized, and the rescue boat\nrammed a capsized boat, putting a hole\nin it. The match was abandoned needless to say, but the Reading team were\nmost hospitable and provided a large fire\nand a good tea.\nIn a three-cornered match against U.C. and Southampton.

One, as usual, will\nbe on the Broads, and the other will be\na sea cruise off the East Coast. At the\nend of the Summer Term there is to be\na West Country Tour in Devon and Cornwall in wh i oh we sail against a large number of clubs there with a team consisting\nof eight people.\nHAIL THE REVOLUTION\nby Jamenski Karterski\n1. Rugby and the Revisionist.\nComrades, it is necessary to look forward to the glorious day (long foretold\nby Marx), when the Revolution will be\naccomplished. It is also necessary to consider the re-organisation of several sports,\nthe first of which is rugby, a game containing elements of a subversive nature,\nnot to mention some capitalist, warmongering overtones in the rules. My committee and I have drawn up the following recommendations under two head-in gs. On the field of play, and entertaining after the game.\nI. On the field of play.\na. The rules should stand as at present,\nbut the emphasis should be changed. An\nexample is, perhaps necessary. Should\none of the hookers strike too soon, the\nreferee, (who will always be addressed\nas \"Commissar Referee\") will blow his\nwhistle and say, \"Foot up, Comrade\nHooker. Penalty.\" This offence, and\nseveral others of a somewhat technical\nnature, should be treated leniently, and\nonly for a second offence should the\ncomrade be sent off. However, for offences\nsuch as kicking, tripping and hacking, it\nshould be made clear by as alu tory term\nof voluntary labour in the Cheshire salt\nmine that such behaviour cannot be allowed in the People's Republic. It is unnecessary to add subversive shouts such\nas \"Get your bloody elbow out of my\neye comrade\" can no longer be allowed.\nMight I also suggest the the scrum\nleader should be looked upon rather as\nthe chairman of a committee than a self-appointed war-mongering capitalist who\ntakes it upon himself to tell the referee\nthat he must be related to the opposing\ncomrade scrum-half. I would also like to\nsuggest that in the case of any dispute\narising, the referee should immediately\norganise the linesmen and himself into\na court of inquiry. Any deliberate lie before the court will, of course, be punished\nmost severe lv. b. Any in f ring men to c curing which\nnecessitates a delay will not be wasted by\nthe comrade players. They will immediately take out their pockets their copies\nof \"The Communist Manifesto of Rugby\"\n(soon to published), in wh i oh they will\nfind endless information about the new\nspirit which pervades the game.\nc. Spectators, too, will have to re-or-ien tate their attitude. Any partisan sentiments wh i oh may be uttered in the form\nform of \"Go on, belt that comrade fly-half\" or \"Commissar ref., you need\nglasses.\" will be punished by immediate,\nexpulsion from the ground.\nII. Entertainment of Visitors.\na. Captains (who will be chairmen of\ni he team committee) will organise the\nsoft drink kitty. They should make sure\n'that each comrade does not hold any opinion of warlike nature. (They should pay\nparticular attention to the attitude of the\nteam's front row. All props must be made\nfully aware that tickling, biting, excessive\npushing and such anti-revolutionary cries\nas \"Do that again and I 'll knock your\nhead off comrade'-' will be dealt with most\nseverely.\nb. Singing of what are now known as\nRugby Club songs will be allowed with\ncertain modifications. \"In Mobile ' will\nbe changed to \"In Vladivostok\", \"The\nEngineer's Song\" to \"The Comrade\nEngineer's Song\", etc., etc. Certain recitations of a rather vulgar nature must,\nof course, be re-orientated in a similar\nway to the songs mentioned above.\n\"Daniel\" will be renamed \"Gorky'-'.\nc. It must be impressed on all comrade\nrugby players that beer (the opiate of the\nrugby playing masses) will no longer be\ndrunk. A certain amount of non-alcohol io cider, will however, be allowed.\nI might add, comrades, that these\nmeasures should be put into effect as soon\nas possible. We should all try our utmost\nto bring nearer that glorious day (long\nforetold by Marx) when no longer' will\nthe bourg eo us dominate the game of rug-by-Published by FELIX BOARD Imperial College, London, 8.W.7.

Before the kick-off\nthe teams were presented to Professor Sir\nDavid Hughes Parry.\nThe game opened with a goal scored\nin thirty seconds. Mousset-Jones broke\nthrough from the kick-off, and his shot\nrebounded from a Kings defender to Casemore, who drove the ball home for the\nfirst goal. This first goal important in a Cup-final, should have given the Imperial\nside great confidence, but Kings, inspired\nby their skipper Lowe, fought back. Luckily for Imperial tl he Kings shooting was\neither too weak to beat goalkeeper Ingram,\nor to wide. A fine move by the Kings\nforwards resulted in Sankey heading into\nthe net, but Be was off-side.\nThe second half opened with Imperial\nattacking, and after thirteen minutes their\nsecond goal was scored from the best move\nof the match, Olding heading in brilliantly\nfrom an accurate cross by Casemore.\nKings, however, did not give up and continued to play hard. Their tenacity was\nrewarded with a goal scored fifteen minutes from the end by left-back Swarbriek\n. . . . \u2022\nSkipper Austin holds aloft the U.L. Cup.\nfrom a corner.

Rugger Final by Dick Lewis I KINGS MISS THREE PENALTIES\nLast Saturday. I.C. playing at Motspur\nPark, virtually their home ground, beat\nKing's in the University Rugby Cup\nFinal to retain the Gutteridge Cup and to\nproduce the proud record of seven wins\nin nine years. They won by 1 try, 1 penalty goal-six points to nil and this was\na fair indication of a game wh i oh never\npromised many points.\nA good Cup Final is, in reality, a hard\ndour game with plenty of excitement;\nthe game fulfilled these conditions exactly\nand was as enjoyable as could be expected\nwith so much at stake.\nA large vocal crowd, with I.C. support es in the majority, made the atmosphere\ntense at the start, even the ball felt it\nfor it refused to stand up for the kick\noff. When the game at last started, the\nsides seemed evenly matched, and it\nKing's kicking had been better they would\nhave gone ahead, for they were awarded\nthree penalty kicks, two of wh i oh were\nin fairly simple positions. Imperial gradually got on top and pressed hard, mostly\nthrough the forward.\nBut the promised try came from a centre, Johnson, who after 25 mins, intercepted a pass on the King's10 yard line\nran well to beat the full back to score\n5 yards in from touch.

Guy\nLast Friday the Union was invaded by\na oo up le of hundred pseudo beatniks arrayed in a variety of clothing, and embellished with such odd ment s as beards,\nsunglasses, top hats and lavatory chains.\n\"Beat for Beginners'' lived up to the high\nstandard set by last year's Carnival, and\na great time was had, one hones, b v all.\nThe flats were exo ellen t. On entering\nthe Conoert Hall, one felt oneself wafted\n3000 miles ao rose the Atlantic to gaze\nupon the New York skyline that is if\none had the time or the inclination to\nstand gazing while such exhilarating music\nwas setting one's eardrums quivering and\none's whole body throbbing in an irresistible urge to \"get with it\". A change\nof surrounding and music could be had\nin the.Upper Lounge, and in a nearby\nroom a poetry (?) reading session took\nplace to spasm o tio bongo-drums accompaniment this satisfied the more intellectually minded. The Lower Lounge as\nusual, became a heaven for those whose\ntastes were simple and basic.\nThe only real criticism to be made concerns the \"eats for beats\". Food was to\nbe provided at 11.30; many people turned\nup at that time, to find nothing more\nthan a few sausage rolls and a litter of\nused cartons and squashed sandwiches.\nThe cabaret, produced by Chris Adams\nand others, was enjoyable to watch. The\nlyrics were clever without being obscene\nand the singing sequences were lively and\nwell rehearsed. The sketches were, how-ever, a little pointless (apart from a brilliant television advertisement for coffins),\nand some of the lines were inaudible. This\nwas not helped by the presence of a few\nloud-mouthed, drunken idiots at the back\nof the hall, who spoilt much of the show\nfor everyone else.\nAfter the cabaret, a basketball match\ni wil h rules apparently derived from Shrove\nu es day football) took place in the gym.\nMines gallantly'took on the rest, and lost\n2-0.\nAt four o'o lock, those hipster s who\nwere still awake , and not otherwise in-vol ved, saw the film \"We're no Angels\",\nset appropriately enough on Devil s Island.

Turning over the page\nwe see in the first line of the next article,\n\"Social Page'-', the word Felix. Obviously\nthis warrants further investigation. With\none hand on the telephone, ready to alert\nour solicitor (you never know; it might\nbe libelous), we read on. And we relax.\nThe writer goes on to expound his opinions of the purpose and usefulness of the\nCoustituent College Unions and what he\nsays may we'll be strongly at variance with\nthe views of others. Altogether an interesting dissertation which could well do\nwith, and in fact deserves further dis-cuss ion.A series of four items under the collect-ive, and very appropriate heading of\n\"Contemporary Amusements\" deal with\npop songs, politics, defence and advert-ising. Pop songs are a serious art form\nand are entitled to serious consideration\nsays the author of the first one. We are\nliving in a dying civilisation is the point\nwhich the second tries to make. The third\nwriter, however, starts off by Showing\njust how secure we are in this age of ballistic missiles. But his article ends in a broken word and a series of dots; a potent reminder of the gravity of the present\nsituation. Looking aga*in at the article we\ncannot help but notice that* the author's name is at the beginning, not the end;\nfor there is no end. Glancing through the\nremainder of the magazine we see that\nthe author's names appear variously at\nthe top and bottom of their contributions.\nIn this a sign of their state of mind? Pess\u00a3mists among them write their names\nat the top for fear that at any moment\nthey may perish and their work will go\nunrecognised. Conversely the optimists\nsign their names at the bottom.\nSo much for facetious diversions, how-ever, let us settle down again and continue our examination. \"No Hawkers\" is\na short story written in a style whe h is\nsometimes relaxed, sometimes rather\nstrained, but on the whole giving a very\nhuman picture of a very human situation.\nOn the other hand \"Imp'e rial College\n\u2014 A Criticism\" is something of a re-state-ment of much of what has gone before;\nsome of the \"problems\" stated are unduly exaggerated and no significantly new\nmethod of approach is applied to those\nproblems which are real. \"The Modern\nEpics\", in the eyes of most of its readers,\nmust present a well balanced view of\nthis rather recent in ovation in the cinema\nindustry.\nWe turn now to the presentation of the\nmaterial. Layout, so often overlooked by\nthe undiscriminating \u2022 reader, is of prime\nimportance in any magazine and a good,\neye-catching presentation will do much to\nenhance the publication no matter how unaware of this the reader may be. In this\nrespect the editorial staff of Phoenix are to\nbe congratulated. An im magi native layout\nhas been used which at the same time is\nnot wasteful of space. The advertisements\ntoo are lively and interesting but for\none exception. Could not the Imperial\nCollege Bookstall produce something more\nfanciful than a price list.\nTo wind up this article just a word to\nthose of you who have not bought a copy\n\u2014II.\u2014\nof Phoenix. To you much of what has\nbeen said above will be meaningless. However, if you can still find a copy laying\nabout then you are well advised to spend\nyour eighteen pence. Its worth every penn\nr r.f.c. Each year, about one hundred undergraduates of U.K. universities fall sick\nwith tuber cu lois is. The student tends to\nbe an easy victim for T.B. because of his\nmany late nights and the tendency to eu t down on meals when the grant starts to\nrun out. Medically, T.B. is now easily\ntreated, but the long convalescence which\nis vital part of the treatment (taking from\nthree months up to a year In serious\ncases) poses several problems to the sick\nstudent. He is probably extremely active\nby nature and mixing with people of his\nown mental ability is necessarily a large\npart of his life. Many months of confinement in a general ward, isolated from\nany serious academic activities, could kill\noff interest in his subject so that successful return to the university, after treat-ment, is difficult or impossible.\nTo meet the need 'for a special environment for students under treatment for\nT.B. the British Student Tuberculosis\nFoundation was formed in 1951 and since\nthat time has treated nearly 400 students.\nIt exists to provide treatment under the\nNational Health Service, and to provide\ntutors and amenities which would otherwise not be available. Bringing together\nstudents with this disease to provide the\nsocial environment that they require is\nprobably as important in the later stages\nof treatment as the medically necessary\nchemotherapy. Since the inception of the\nstudent unit at Pinewood, Berks, almost\nevery university faculty has been represented there, and about 50 percent of\nthe students have been from overseas.\nThe intimate contact with other students\nof such varied nationality and interest\nprovides something bordering on the ideal\nuniversity education: making up in part\nfor the misfortune of contracting T.B. Treatment on this scale is necessary and\nexpensive, yet it costs the sick student\nnothing. The Foundation is a charity, and\nits nature is such that appeals can be\nmade only to students and student bodies.\nThis year an appeal has been launched\nwhich it is hoped will realise about\n\u00a310,000, to ensure continuation of the\nwork for the next three year or so. Since\nthe Imperial College charity is this year\ndirected mainly towards the Oxfam cause,\nthe College contribution to this appeal\nwill not be massive. A collection will be\nheld in the College on a single day, Tuesday 21st March. Imperial College owes\nthe Foundation a considerable debt, since\n1951 at least one I.C, student has been\ntreated in its student unit every year.\nThat students here are generous with non-student charities is evidenced by the effort put into our annual carnival. It is\nnot often that we are asked to contribute\nto a purely student charity and this is a really worthy cause, so when a tin is\nshaken under your nose on Tuesday\nplease don't ignore it. Be a little more\ngenerous than you can afford.\n\u00a3et te> cd to the Zdttox,\nDear Sir,\nI should like to bring to the attention\nof the members of the College the fact\nthat there will be a Blood-Donor session\nin the Union Concert Hall on Monday,\nMay 8th. The session held last term was\nfairly well patronised but not well enough.\nFor a College of about 2,700 young ad-ul ts,a total of 140 donations was disappointingly low.\nReflect for a moment just how lucky\nthe majority of you are. Probably only\na few of you ever had serious operations\ninvolving transfusion of large quantities\nof blood, but there are a great many\npeople who owe their lives to such transfusions . For instance, the repair of a septa l defect (hole in the heart) involving the use of an artificial lung, requires\nabout nine pints of blood to prime*\" the\nmachine alone, let alone tih at required by\nthe patient during and after the opera t ion. One hospital alone performs about\n100 of these operations per year, and this\ncondition is relatively rare.\nIf you consider that the only pain a donor feels, if the pain it can be called,\nis the injection of the local anaesthetic,\nand that the complete donation (in clu d ing FREE cup of tea) takes about 40\nminutes, you will realise that the inconvenience involved is an extremely small\nprice to pay to help save the life of an-other. I therefore ask everyone of you to\nconsider seriously enrolling as a Honor\nat this next session. Can we realise 250\ndonations? I sincerely hope so.\nYours sincerely,\nD.P. McDermoU\njustice be done and arrange a \"champion-ship\" fight between Guilds and Mmes,\nwith adjudicators of course 1 Perhaps,\nhowever, Mr. Carter, Mr. Greaves and\nMr. Munro are not very keen on being\nthrashed again by a superior team.\nYours sincerely,\nA.S, Chalmers R.S; M. Dear Sir,\nThe result of the Debating Challenge Cup\nshows how ridiculous the rules are. The\nbasic facts are that:\na.R.S. M beat R.C.S. b. Guilds beat R.C.S. c.R.S. M. beat Guilds.\nA fiddle of adding up the points gives\nus the result \u2014 1st Guilds.\nI am all in favour of unbiassed adjudicators to decide on each individual deb-ate, and so prevent block votes influencing any result, but they could make the\nsystem much fairer by awarding points\nfor a win or a tie. The obvious result\nshould be corrected to:\nt.R.S. M.2. Guilds.\n3. R.C.S. In what other activities and sports does\nthis fiddle govern results? I can think of\nnone.\nFor heaven's sake let vis get rid. of these\nanomalous rules. It may even start to dispose of the apathy which led to only\n80 people being present at the debate.\nCome on Finlay, and Jim Carter, let\nDear Sir,\nBeing touched by a mixture of hot Arizona sun, and several cans of Fizzy Schlitz\nbeer (\"The beer that made Milwaukee\nfamous\"), I bethought myself to offer\na few words of wisdom to my younger\nbrethren.\nHaving moved around a little since\nleaving College, and sampled the delights\nof New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San\nFrancisco, and now cow-boy land, I come\nto the surprising conclusion that Imperial\nCollege is admirably situated for s a mpl ing:\na. The female sex.\nb. The best beer.\nc. The best food.\nPossibly the worst emotion of all is\nregret. I, myself even now find myself\nregretting how little use I made of the\nopportunities available in Kensington and\nenvirons, and I doubt if anybody would\nhave classified me as a brown-b agger. What horrible sensation must a brown-b agger experience once, he gets into the\nwide world and finds it quite barren. Make\nthe most of I.C. young man, you may\nnever see its like again\nWilf Corringhan,\nApt. 1\n1332 N.50th St.\nPhoenix,\nArizona.\nI am a normal British subject, able to\nstand up to most of the trials imposed\non a democratic society, but the last straw\nbreak es the camel's back.\nThe other afternoon, whilst sitting\nquietly in a corner of the Snack Bar and\nmeditating my meagre portion of bread\nand jam, I was assailed by what can only\nbe termed 'biologists'. They arranged\nthemselves in adjacent chairs and proceeded to discuss in detail such sights as\nthe shaving of a dead shrew by monster\nlice. After five minutes I made a hurried\nretreat to the Snooker Room,\nI forgot about the incident until late\nm the evening when, whilst reclining in\nmy armchair, I found myself scratching\naway at what gradually developed to my\nhorror, into a vicious looking gnat bite.\nHurriedly I immersed myself in a bath\nof hot disinfectant to oust the offending\nrascal.\nNow, I am open to correction, but I firmly believe that gnats do not appear\nat the end of February, and therefore logically deduce that the source of supply\nwas ip fact the aforementioned gentlemen.\nThat this event should occur is an out-rage, and I suggest that an efficient\ncleansing arrangement be devised for all\nbiologists. Alternatively, they could sport\nplacards proclaiming 'unclean', and have\na section of the Union set aside for their\nexclusive use, but for heaven's sake let\ninnocent people scratch in peace.\nIrritatingly yours,\nC, Mingo, Physics I. Dear Sir,\nIt appears that Felix is leading an almost aimless existence. For instance, in\nyour last but one copy (of February 17th) there were only four pages. About thirty\nper cent of these were taken in moaning\nabout the low attendance at Union meet-in gs, and included often nonsensical articles on the reason for it. The remaining\ncontent being one or two articles on 'in-tell ect u al is m' and the Carnival, and a page of sport. Is this all there is to write\nabout a supposedly first class college i.f2,700 members? Surely more of interest\nhappens in the College in two weeks than\nthis?\nAs stated in the editorial of February\nthe 17th, the principle aim of a college\nnewspaper should be to \"present the college to the college\" (adapting an extinct\nphrase). In this respect Felix falls down-There is not nearly enough factual and interesting material printed. I do not be-li eve, as the Editor himself has written,\nthat journalistic talent does not exist at\nthe Imperial College.\nThe lack of material in Felix cannot be\nblamed solely on the members of the College, but also on the Felix stuff. They\nshould never hope for a lot of evenly balanced material of a high standard to flow\nin for successive copies. They should approach members of sporting and social societies for accounts of the activities of\nthose societies, to a much greater degree\nthan at) present. They should preview and\nreview lunch th ne and other lectures and\nrecitals of general interest.\nAt the present, Imperial College is a very impersonal college simply because it\nis so hard to find out everything that is\nhappening. By making the material in Felix so much more informative and inter-e sting, this fault in the College could to\na great extent be remedied with little\nextra work for the Felix staff. Perhaps\nthe attendances at Union meetings might\nil so increase.\nYours faithfully\nR.S. Vines\n\n"
