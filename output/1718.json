The\nsmell of cookies in the\noven wafted in the air, and\nthe staff were extremely\nfriendly and helpful in\nhelping us choose what to\norder(seriously,thechoice\nis massive!). However,\nthe most interesting bit\nwas how cookie dough\nis served. Here, the raw\ncookie dough is freshly\nbaked right before your\neyes - but only enough to\nmake the outside crispy\nand the inside soft and\ngooey. All cookies are\nalso served with a dollop\nof soft serve - surprisingly\ngood at making the incredibly sweet cookies more\nrefreshing and delicious.\nThe choice of flavours was\nsimply amazing, and they\nalso offer cookie dough\nshakes, a twist on your\n\u201dThis place\nadds a\ncompletely\ndifferent\ntwist to what\nwe were\nexpecting\u201d\nclassic milkshake. With\nregards to the flavours we\ntried:\nLotus Biscoff\nJulia says: Having\nfallen in love with Lotus\ncookie dough in the past,\nI was extremely excited\nabout this. This flavour\ncertainly lived up to the\nBiscoff hype (did you\nknow they now have\nLotus Biscoff ice cream\nsold in the UK?), with not\nonly a deliciously warm\nLotus cookie, but also\na rich creamy topping,\nwhich paired with the soft\nserve was a match made\nin heaven.\nEva says: Lotus biscuits\nhave always been my\nfavourite so I had high expectations for this cookie\ndough, and My Cookie\nDough took those expectations and completely\nsurpassed them all. The\nflavours were delicately\nbalanced, and the ice\ncream on the side helped\nneutralise the sweetness\nand made for an overall\namazing experience.\nRating: 4.5/5\nRed Velvet\nEva says: This was not\nthe one for me, unfortu-nately. I felt very overwhelmed with the amount\nof sugar in the dough\nand didn\u2019t really taste of\nanything in particular.\nThe presentation was\nwonderful, though, and it\nlooked very interesting,\nbut unfortunately the taste\ndidn\u2019t match the looks.\nJulia says: Red\nvelvet has always been a\nmystery to me. Why does\nred dough taste different\nto normal dough when\nall that differs is the\ncolouring? Unfortunately,\nalthough ideal if you\u2019re\ncraving sugar, that\u2019s all\nthis tasted like - sugar,\ntopped with more sugar\n(diabetes is an understate-ment). Nevertheless, this\nis definitely the most interesting flavour we tried,\nso props for that!\nRating: 2.5/5\nCinnamon Bun\nJulia says: I love\ncinnamon in any shape\nor form, from savoury\ndishes to baked goods,\nso the prospect of having\na cinnamon cookie was\ngreat. A cool twist was\nthe cookie - instead of\nthe typical plain cookie\ndough you\u2019d expect, it\nwas actually made of\nthe scrumptious Lotus\nBiscoff dough - aka 2 of\nmy favourite things in one\n- #win! The frosting was\na little sweet, but when\nmelted with the ice cream\nwas completely edible.\nEva says: This was\nhands-down one of my\nall-time favourite cookie\ndough flavours. Anything\nwith cinnamon just feels\nlike a warm hug on a\ncold winter\u2019s day, and\nthis cookie dough was\nno exception. If your\ngo-to cookie dough is\nBiscoff, then you\u2019re in for\na treat - with cinnamon\non top. The frosting was\na fantastic addition for\nme (and everyone else\nwhose favourite part of\na cinnamon bun is the\nfrosting mmm\u2026)\nRating: 4/5\nThe Slutty Brownie\nEva says: This was a\nlovely palette-cleanser\nand made me feel all\ntypes of things. With\noreos sprinkled all over\nthe cookie dough, there\nwas a nice crunch to it and\nthe melted Nutella on the\ntop was to-die-for. Who\nwould\u2019ve thought you\ncould get so much chocolate goodness in one stack\nof cookie dough? Got a\nsugar craving? Chocolate\ncraving? Cookie craving?\nThis stack will sort you\nout like no other!\nJulia says: After trying\nso many cookies, it was\ntime for a stack, so obvi-ously, we went for their\nbestseller, a chocolaty\nmix of a triple chocolate\ncookie stacked onto a milk\nchocolate cookie,with\ncrushed Oreos, and coated\nwith a generous portion\nof melted Nutella. Sounds\nlike a sugar coma? You\u2019d\nbe absolutely right, but a\ndelicious one at that.\nRating: 4.5/5\nS\u2019Mores\nJulia says: Last, but\ndefinitely not least. This\ngooey and rich Lotus\nbiscoff, chocolate, and\nmarshmallow melt was\ncertainly my favourite of\nall the flavours we tried.\nNot only did it satisfy\nmy love for Biscoff (it is\nstroooong guys), but the\nchocolate cookie toned\ndown the sweetness, and\nthe marshmallow was the\nperfect quirky addition.\nThe ice cream wasn\u2019t\neven necessary, but made\nthe delicious experience\neven better.\nEva says: Though I\u2019m\nnot normally a lover of\nall-things-chocolate, this\nflavour was exceptional.\nThe marshmallows were\nmy favourite bit, and\ngave the dough a different\ntexture that completely\nbamboozled our taste\nbuds - we were so here\nfor it. This was one of My\nCookie Dough\u2019s \u201cstacks\u201d,\nwhich meant you got different doughs to try, with\nonly one order! It satisfies\nall your cravings but make\nsure you go on an empty\nstomach because it\u2019s a big\none!\nRating: 5/5\nMy Cookie Dough has\nexceeded our expectations and satisfied all our\ncravings,leavingusinabit\nof a food coma afterwards\nthat was 100% worth it.\nWith most of their doughs\npriced at a reasonable\n\u00a35-10, grabbing a yummy\ndessert doesn\u2019t need to\nbreak the bank. They are\nalso working on exciting\nprojects, one of which\nis developing some new\nvegan flavours, which is\ngreat for the environment\nand can make it so much\neasier for those that want\nto make the transition\ninto being vegan but are\nstruggling with missing\nthe variety of flavours\navailable. They\u2019re also on\nDeliveroo so no excuses\nnow!\nCinammon Bun Cookie Dough // Eva Tadros\nISSUE 1718\nFELIX\nFOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nDelicious cookie dough with soft serves // Eva Tadros\n\n"

They found that\nthe effects of inhibiting\nthe enzyme over longer\ntime scale reduced the risk\nof cardiovascular disease\nwith no obvious adverse\neffects of blocking this\npathway. The benefit was\nidentical to that expected\nas though blocking the\nenzyme targeted by statins\nwhen individuals were\nmatched for change in\ncholesterol.\nProfessor Ray added:\n\u201cOne of the key advantages of bempedoic acid\nis supposed to be that it\nshouldn\u2019tcausethemuscle\nside effects reported by\nsome statins users. It could\nbe an option for patients\nwho are unable to tolerate\nstatins at higher doses, or\nat all. Our genetic studies\nsuggest that the benefit\non prevention of heart\ndisease and strokes in\nongoing trials should be\nidentical to that achieved\nthrough statins.\u201d\n\u201cOverall, these latest\nstudies show that not only\nis the treatment generally\nwell-tolerated being\ncomparable with placebo,\nand potentially safe over\nlonger periods, but that\nwhen added to high intensity statin treatment it\ncan help to further reduce\nLDL cholesterol levels.\nThe ongoing trial, called\n\u2018CLEAR Outcomes\u2019, is\nspecially testing even\nlonger-term safety and\nwhether this approach\nreduces cardiovascular\ndisease in addition to\nlowering cholesterol.\u201d\nBoth bempedoic acid inhibits ACL, an key enzyme in cholesterol production // Esperion\nSCIENCE\nHenry Alman\nScience Editor\n\n"

You'd think, with\nonly eight issues left in\nmy tenure as Editor, I\nwould surely know how to\nwrite an Editorial by now.\nYou'd be wrong. As per,\nI'm just going to waffle\nand run you through my\nweek until I've filled out\nthis page. Feel free to tap\nout now.\nLast Thursday I attended the WE Innovate Final,\nto celebrate women's en-trepreneurship. The event\nwas particularly special\nfor me because my friend\nLauren's memory was\nhonoured with a \u00a35000\nprize being awarded in her\nname. Massive thank you\nto Liz Choonara and Professor Maggie Dallman\nfor such a fitting and\ntasteful tribute. Lauren\nalways said she \"didn't\nwant to be mourned, she\nwanted to be remem-bered\" and I think we did\nthat. It was also the first\ntime I'd seen her parents\nTim and Lorraine since\nthe funeral in November\nand we had a truly lovely\ndinner afterwards. I've\nbeen pretty happy since\nmy team overturned a 2-0\ndeficit in the Champions\nLeague last Wednesday\nand this just felt like icing\non the cake.\nSpeaking of Man\nUnited, for most of the\nyear I've successfully\nfought the urge to turn this\nEditorial into a weekly\nrun down of my team's\nperformance. Mainly\nbecause Mourinho left me\ncompletely apathetic to\n2\nfootball until his sacking\nin December. Also, I\nthought I'd developed\nmore of a personality than\n\"the guy that always talks\nabout football\". Guess I\nwas wrong...

Whether it was the\ninfuriating driving scenes,\ncreating the ultimate\ncustom character (bounty\nhunter helmet + lightsaber\nin my case), or saving up\nthe studs necessary to buy\nforce ghost Yoda, many\nof us have fond memories\nof that game. But in truth,\nthe game is simple, and\nnowadays it would be\nconsidered mediocre at\nbest and boring at worst.\nFeatures such as many\ncollectibles and repetitive\ncombat are now considered deplorable things and\nare mocked in the gaming\ncommunity today. So what\nmade LEGO Star Wars\ndifferent? My answer: the\npermanent existence of\nPlayer 2.\nFor many of us, this\nwas the game that you\u2019d\nplay at a sleepover or what\nyou play when you invited\nyour best mate round to\nyour home. It wasn\u2019t fun\nunless both of you were\nthere playing it together,\nunlocking characters and\nmaking mistakes. It was a\ntrue co-op game, a breed\nthat is unfortunately dying\nout.\nAllow me to first define\nthe difference between\nMultiplayer and Co-op.\nMultiplayer games thrive\nwith the more players they\nhave. Fortnite, Battlefield,\nWorld of Warcraft - these\nare games with vastly\ndifferent mechanics, their\nenjoyable nature coming\nas a product of the scale\nof their player base,\nwith a massive number\nof people competing in\nlarge teams or against\none another. Co-op on the\nother hand functions on\na smaller scale. Classics\ninclude Left 4 Dead,\nBorderlands, and Portal 2.\nA key difference between\nthe two is the attitude\ntowards the number of\nplayers and the gameplay.\nIn Multiplayer, the fun\nis focused on the shared\nexperience, but doing so\noften limits the immersion\nof the individual. There\nare exceptions, such as\nthe classic Star Wars Battlefront games, where you\nhad to earn your classes\nin the battle through\nracking up kills. Unlike\nmany of the current mul-tiplayers games, which\nhave various abilities and\naccessories, your skill was\nthe only thing that was\ncarried across matches.\nCo-op, on the other hand,\nis often optimised for a\nhandful of players. This\n\u201cThough\nthe triple A\nlandscape is\nbleak, luckily\nthere are\nsurvivors\u201d\n\u201cThe nature\nof gaming\nhas changed,\nand Co-op has\nevolved into\nsomething\nelse, MOBAs\u201d\ncan be seen by things\nsuch as mechanics where\na team member can revive\nanother, or where abilities\nfocus on improving the\noverall effects of the party.\nHowever, a growing trend\nhas me concerned.\nI\u2019m sure there will be\naccusations of gatekeep-ing, but I do not consider\ngames such as Destiny,\nThe Division and Anthem\nto be Co-op games. They\nare \u201cshared world\u201d singleplayer games, which\nis another way of saying\nMMOs done badly. The\noriginal hype of Destiny\nbecoming the new Halo\nwas rapidly lost, and\nalthough the game has\nimproved, it has failed to\ncapture the core fun that\ncame from games like\nHalo 2 and the fast paced\nclassic shooters it tried to\nmatch. Anthem is riddled\nwith problems, besides\nthe technical ones that\nare spreading across the\ninternet. The problem lies\nwithin the fact that these\ngames are based off of\nthe idea that Co-op and\nMultiplayer are the same,\nand that using Multiplayer\ngame design in a Singleplayer world achieves the\nequivalent.\nIt does not.\nThough the triple A\nlandscape is bleak, luckily\nthere are survivors.\nGameplay that is as fun\nas couch Co-op rarely\ngoes unnoticed. Indie\nstudios are keeping the\ngenre alive, and classics\nlike Magicka and Left 4\nDead will always be fun\nto play. But the nature of\ngaming has changed, and\nCo-op has evolved into\nsomething else, MOBAs.\nNow I realise that many\nwill say that MOBAs are\nMultiplayer, that just\nbecause you team up with\nyour friends to fight on the\nsame team doesn\u2019t make\nit Co-op. But for me, the\nfeeling I get when playing\nDotA or Overwatch or\nLeague is the same feeling\nof working towards something with a friend that I\nhad when I was younger.\nThough competitive, the\nfeel of a MOBA when\nplaying with friends\nin company to random\nstrangers online is not the\nsame as the equivalent in\nlarge scale multiplayer\ngames. In my humble\nopinion, I believe I know\nwhy this is.\nIn Battlefield, your\nsquad are a blip on a large\nmap. Your fun comes from\nwhen you each capture\na point or rack up your\nK/D ratio. In Borderlands,\nyou and your friends\nare wildly firing ability\nspamming your way to the\nboss fight. Your fun will\ncome from the utter chaos\nof the environment you\u2019ve\nthrown yourself into and\ngetting that sweet, sweet\nloot. In MOBAs, you and\nyour team depend on each\nother to successfully and\ntactically take the enemy\ntowers down, whilst\nholding their own in a\nfight.\nIn short, Co-op games\nare fun, because they\nare cooperative (No shit\nSherlock, right?). Your\nscore is irrelevant unless\nall of you survive; your\nvictory is short-lived if\nothers are failing; your\nsuccess is only thanks to\nthe combined efforts of\nthe team. In the end, it is\na team game, and team\ngames are always more\nfun if you know your\nteam.\nGood Co-op games are\nfew and far in between,\nand these big imposter\ngames that prioritise your\nown personal loot and\nsuccess over core fun\nteam gameplay fail to\nrealise the joy of winning\nwith a team, and what it\nmeans to have your Player\n2, your team. But gaming\nhas gone through many\niterations, and maybe\nafter the MOBA boom\nand the arena boom that\nfollowed it, a Co-op boom\nwill follow.\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ll\nbe branching out into 2D\nrogue-likes, those early\naccess Kickstarter games\naren\u2019t gonna fund them-selves!\nWhen it comes down to a test of quality who reigns supreme? // EA & 2K Games\n\n"

Politics\nand social agenda aside,\nCaptain Marvel is an\nentertaining, though not\nfully satisfying, chapter\nof the Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse (MCU).\nKickstarted by Captain\nAmerica: Civil War\nand to be concluded by\nAvengers: Endgame\ncoming next month,\nPhase 3 of the MCU\ncontains some of the best\nfilms produced by Marvel\nStudios, including the\nhilarious Thor: Ragnarok,\nthe ruminative Black\nPanther, and of course\nthe ultimate blockbuster\nAvengers: Infinity War.\nStanding among these\ncritical and commercial\ngiants, Captain Marvel,\na Phase 1-type superhero\norigin film through and\nthrough, manages to stand\non its own as a thoroughly\nenjoyable Marvel flick.\nThe story of the film\nis relatively generic and\nstraightforward, bar a few\nsurprises and told in a\nrather strangely convoluted way. There is also not\na huge amount of conflict\nor tension - all in all; it is\nnot vastly different from\nmost other MCU origin\nfilms. However, Marvel\nStudios understands\nthat its strength lies in\nits characters. Despite\nflimsy plotting, with 120\nminutes, this film has\nmade me grow attached\nto the new hero, and I am\nmore than happy to see\nher join the other MCU\nflagship heroes such as\nIron Man and Captain\nAmerica.\nBrie Larson\u2019s depiction\nof Carol Danvers was hard\nto put into words. It is not\nnecessarily emotionless\nor flat, rather, I think\nI would use the word\n\u201cdetermined\u201d. Without\nputting a whole range of\nfacial movements on her\nface, she successfully\nconveyed the charisma\nand strength that radiates\nfrom within. Samuel L.\nJackson reprises his role\nas Director Fury. His absolutely fun and enthusiastic\nperformance, with truly\ncompelling de-aging CGI,\nallows him to dominate\nevery scene he is in.\nThe chemistry between\nthe main cast, including\nGoose the \u201ccat\u201d, carries\nthe blander moments in\nthe screenplay.\nUnexpectedly, contrary\nto many MCU origin\nfilms, Captain Marvel\ndoes not suffer from an\nunenergetic and fatigued\nsecond act \u2013 the time\nbetween gaining powers,\nand facing the final villain.\nAs a matter of fact, I find\nCaptain Marvel\u2018s second\nact the most compelling\npart of the story. Captain\nMarvel\u2019s discovery of her\nown past and family is\nthe most emotional and\npoignant part of the film.\nAnd when the third act\narrives, along with the\ncacophony of explosions\nand punches, the film\nactually becomes rather\ndull.\nOverall, with lovable\ncharacters, dedicated\nperformances and a\nkiller post-credit sneak\npeek, Captain Marvel is\na mid-tier MCU film that\nserves as a sufficient, but\nfamiliar, origin story for a\nbrand new hero.\nBeing John Malkovich\nI\nrecently turned\ntwenty. After battling through the\nbittersweet feelings\nof aging, a newfound existential angst and a sudden realisation of one\u2019s\nmortality, I found it in\nmyself to truly cherish\nthis milestone and discover this treasure of a\nfilm from the year I was\nborn.\nBeing John Malkovich\nis exactly what it says on\nthe tin. An avid puppeteer,\nCraig Schwartz (played\nby John Cusack), stumbles upon a portal leading\ndirectly into the mind and\nbody of Hollywood actor,\nJohn Malkovich (played\nby John Malkovich).\nWhat follows is a queer\nride through the bizarre\nback alleys of humanity\nwith enough surrealist\ncontrivance to whisk your\nforesight of the plot into\nstiff peaks. Top performances are given by the\nrest of the cast, including\nan unrecognisable Cameron Diaz and the brilliant\nCatherine Keener. It\u2019s an\nimpressive debut from\ndirector Spike Jonze and\nwriter Charlie Kaufman,\nwho would go on to make\nmany other greats such as\nHer and Eternal Sunshine\nof the Spotless Mind.\nThis meta masterpiece\ncertainly seems to have\naged better than I. There\nis a refreshingly proud\nprogressive narrative that\nweaves its heavy-duty\nthemes of transfiguration\nwith absurdist humour.\nIs it a comedy? Perhaps\nin the Shakespearian\nsense. The sweet streak of\nsadness exists somewhere\nbetween the Coen Brothers and Terry Gilliam. It\u2019s\nan out-and-about feminist\nmovie that deserves more\nrecognition.\nWith the wackiness\naside, Being John Malkovich is strangely poetic\nand meditative. The\ncharacters\u2019 feelings of\nfrustration, self-loathing\nand childish desires draw\nparallel to the cusp of\nadolescent anguish into\nmillennial adulthood that\nthe film would experience,\nif indeed it was \u201cborn\u201d in\nthe year 1999. So relax,\nput your feet up and go\non this ethereal trip into\nthe mind and soul of John\nMalkovich.\nAvailable on Netflix\n(and on BoB).\nShare your favourite\nfilm from the year you\nwere born with Felix\nFilm!

    "content": "Kicking Up a Fuss Over Them/Us\nA\ns the curtain\nrises and faces\nstare with\nanticipation,\nfor the last time until you\nexit stage, you feel your\nheart beat through your\nchest. Countless hours\nhave gone into training,\nlearning, creating, per-fecting, and bonding with\nothers on stage. I am, of\ncourse, referring to how\nI felt back when I used to\ndance. If that\u2019s how I felt\nwhendancing as a hobby,\nI can only imagine how\nit must\u2019ve felt for the six\nmen I saw on stage last\nWednesday night.\nCreated by the dancers\nof the company BalletBoyz, the pressure for\nThem/Us was definitely\non as the reigns had been\nhanded over from the\nfounders Michael Nunn\nand William Trevitt. The\nshow was split into two\nparts: \u201cThem\u201d and \u201cUs\u201d.\nThe first act \u201cThem\u201d\nwas choregraphed solely\nby the dancers of the\ncompany and was done\nso simultaneously with\nthe score composition,\nby Charlotte Harding.\nYou can see clearly from\nthe choreography that it\nwas created by the people\nperforming it. The motifs\namplify the incredible\nstrength and fluidity of the\nperformer\u2019s movement\nability, and flow beautifully together like a well-oiled machine that created\nitself.\nThe movement was\nfabulously controlled and\nnever reached a fever pitch\n(I\u2019d describe it as \u201cdialled\nup to nine\u201d). There were\nno great leaps, falls or\nlifts. Instead, the majority\nof the half hour run time\nwas filled with large, bold\nmovements that stretched\nthe performers bodies, or\nclose contact work that\nmade it seem as though\nthe dancers shared one\nmind. While I could not\nsee any incredible innovation or presentation of\nflare, the show excels in\npresenting performers\nin complete harmony.\nThe choreography was\nmade by all members in a\ncontinuous collaborative\nway, the final product is\na demonstration of their\ncollaborative power.\nlike the choreography,\nfelt natural and weaved\ninto the performance\neffortlessly. Her minimal\nuse of instruments helped\nachieve the seamless\ncombination of sight and\nsound. With few string\ninstruments and the\nsimplest percussion, her\ncomposition managed\nto match the unbroken\nenergy of the dancers.\nIn a very Imperialesque\nmoment, the sound of\nHarding\u2019s composition\ncaused me to imagine the\ndancer\u2019s fibres of skeletal\nmuscle as the strings of\nthe cello I was hearing.\nNow I\u2019ve managed to\ngo this long without mentioning the elephant in the\nroom, or more accurately,\nthe giant cuboid frame on\nthe stage. This was my favourite part of the show as\nit led to some incredibly\ninteresting use of levels\nand space. As a frame it\nallowed the performers to\nmove in and out, treating\nthe space differently in\nrelation to one another\nand even going as far as\nto impact the demeanour\nof individual performers.\nAlternatively, as a transparent cuboid it produced\na kind of negative space in\nthe stage where you could\nsee through, but it felt as\nthough you shouldn\u2019t have\nbeen able to. I do think it\ncould\u2019ve been used more\nextensively and in different creative ways, but I\nmust remind myself that\nit\u2019s a ballet not a circus.\nThe frame also led to my\nfavourite moment in the\nentire show, hands down.\nAs Harding\u2019s score crescendos and the dancers\nbegin to take form, a\nsudden change in lighting\nleads to a stunning silhou-ette. I couldn\u2019t help but let\nout a small \u201cwow\u201d under\nmy breath.\nwas originally a duet\nchoreographed by Christopher Wheeldon for\nBalletBoyz. The company\nasked Wheeldon to come\nback and provide the\nstory to what happened\nbefore the duet. It is a\nfantastic piece of chore-ography, ending with the\nphenomenal duet which is\none of the most sensitive\nand compelling I have\nseen for a while. I will say\nno more about the second\nhalf because I don\u2019t want\nto spoil all aspects of the\nshow and also because\nI feel way more out of\nmy comfort zone talking\nabout Wheeldon\u2019s chore-ography.\nThem/Us is certainly\nnot going to become an\ninfamous, long-lasting\nballet. However, it is an\nutter joy to watch such\ntalented people create\nsomething purely from\nthemselves and their\nfriendship. I only wish\nthat I could ever be part\nof such a show and join\nthem(/us).\nTwenty years on since the conception of the company, BalletBoyz are still producing fantastic works of modern\ncontemporary ballet.\nDynamic, breathtaking: the BalletBoyz stun in this innovative production // Sadler\u2019s Wells\nISSUE 1718\nFELIX\n22\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nGuthrie Ruby\nArts Writer\nWhere?

The composition, just\n\u201cAn utter joy to\nwatch\u201d\nIf it weren\u2019t for spoilers,\nI\u2019d go on for another page\nabout all the moments I\nloved in that first half.\nThe second half \u201cUs\u201d\nThe beauty behind the monster of Frankenstein\nF\nrankenstein has\nlong borne the\nfalse title of a\nfrightening and\ntwisted tale. However,\nthe focus of this story is\nreally on the loneliness of\nFrankenstein\u2019s Creature,\nand its cravings for the\naffections of his master.\nUpon the loss of his\nmotherinchild-birth,Victor\nFrankenstein succumbs to a\ndeep and consuming grief.\nHe embarks on medical\nschool and is introduced\nto the idea of reanimation.\nWith the hope of a family\nreunited and more than a\nhint of madness, Frankenstein stitches together and\nawakens the Creature. Yet\nFrankenstein only feels fear\nupon sight of his creation\nand chooses to reject this\nlost and innocent being.\nThe sorrow of the Creature\nquickly turns to thoughts of\nanger and revenge and this\nleads to a series of harrowing tragedies. Despite it all,\nthe Creature continues to\ndesire the companionship\nof Frankenstein and shows\nus as an audience that the\nmost primal desire is that\nof love.\nLiam Scarlett\u2019s ballet\nis true to the moving\nnarrative of the original\nnovel but also striking in its\nown right. Every aspect of\ndelivery was polished and\nstunning, with the score\nof Lowell Liebermann\nperformed flawlessly on\nthe night by the resident\nOrchestra of the Royal\nOpera House. The fluid\ntones blended seamlessly\nwith the dancers, elevating\nthe emotion through tense\ncrescendo and complimenting the romance between\nVictor and his wife, Elizabeth, with soft melodies.\nThe dancers themselves were artful in their\nmovement. The Principal,\nVictor Frankenstein, was\nportrayed by Federico\nBonelli; William Bracewell\ndebuted as the Creature;\nLaura Morera shone as\nElizabeth.\nA particular strength\nof this performance was\nthe contrast between the\ncharacters and the manner\nthis was conveyed through\ndance. Bonelli carried off\nstrong and unhesitating\nleaps and lifts throughout,\ntelling of Frankenstein\u2019s\nseriousness and drive.\nBracewell was a true and\nparticular joy to behold.\nHe was elegant in a manner\nalmost feminine and the\nhope and longing of the\nCreature was palpable.\nThere were also occasions\nof self-loathing and fast,\nflighty movement that\ncaptured these spates of\noverwhelming emotion.\nThis is not to forget Morera,\nwho radiated beauty\nand joy. Her character is\ninstrumental to bringing\nhappiness and light to the\nstory and to Frankenstein,\nwho is plagued by fear of\nretribution and other night-mares.\nAnother impressive\naspect of this ballet is its\ndesign - every element\nof it. The scene when\nFrankenstein first enters the\nsurgical theatre is one of the\nmost powerful moments in\nits staging. The lighting by\nFinn Ross draws out deep\nshadows, producing an\neerie and serious atmosphere initially. This is also\nthe location of the machine\nthat animates the Creature.\nThe large, heavily lit\noperation table that lowers\nto centre stage only exacerbates the drama of this.\nHowever, all prior\nscenes pale in comparison\nto the masterpiece that is\nthe final act of Frankenstein. Gorgeous staging\nof a curling staircase and\nsweeping lights set the\nbackdrop to the twinkling\ngowns of the Royal Ballet\ndancers. The soft beauty of\nHow Eva von Schnippisch won WWII\nW\nho is\nEva von\nSchnippisch\nand what\ndoes she have to do with\nWWII? You might be\nforgiven for wondering if\nyou\u2019d fallen asleep one\ntoo many times in history\nclass, but Stephanie\nWare\u2019s one-woman cabaret has very, very little to\ndo with the actual affairs\nof WWII at all.\nIt\u2019s an unashamedly sala-cious, nonsensical and hilarious tale of how a certain Eva\nvon Schnippisch, a cabaret\nperformer in Weimar Germany, gets recruited by the\nBritish Secret Service and\nends up working her way\nto the very top of the Nazi\nParty. On the way, she goes\non missions in France and\nRussia (cue comically bad\nFrench and Russian stereo-types). Sex inevitably saves\nthe day! In France, she is\nworking with the French\nresistance when their headquarters are raided. I\u2019ll leave\nyou to guess where she hid\ntheir smuggled radio, but it\nleads to music issuing from\nher nether regions\u2026 a great\ndistraction while they grab\nthe hapless German soldier\nand do unspeakable things to\nhis body with a pair of curling tongs. In Russia, she falls\nin love with her target, the\nRussian colonel \u2018Vladimir\u2019,\nbut alas \u2013 his very strange\nsexual fetish leads to her discovering the secret code tattooed on his body (in a very\nstrange place) and she must\nleave to fulfil her duties. She\nis the best spy of the British\nintelligence, after all.\nNothing is taken too seriously here. As with any good\ncabaret, the aim is to shock,\ntitillate and scandalise. Orgasms on stage! Blowjobs!\nThongs! Hitler\u2019s bunker re-imagined as a sex dungeon!\nIt could have been incredibly weird, but Ware pulls it\noff with aplomb. She has a\ngreat sense of audience and\nreally knows how to play a\ncrowd. Before we know it,\nwe\u2019re chanting \u2018Ja, Eva, ja!\u2019\nand making airplane noises\nat her request. And she keeps\nit up even while she\u2019s changing costumes \u2013 military hats,\nFrench berets, feather boas\nand Bavarian Lederhosen all\nmake an appearance.\nThe quick-fire narrative is\ninterrupted from time to time\nby comedic musical num-bers, which Ware belts out\nin her surprisingly powerful\nsinging voice. As for stag-ing, it\u2019s pared-down but perfectly timed. Simple back-drops, cabaret-style music\nand quick lighting changes.\nWho needs stage accessories\nwhen we have Eva? For a\none-woman show, she certainly fills the stage. The 90\nminutes whiz by as she takes\nus through her hurly-burly\nadventures, climaxing (pun\nnot intended) in a love affair\nwith Eva Braun that ends\nwith her killing Hitler and,\nthus, winning WWII.

Psycho\nW\nhat a way\nto kick off\nthe album.\nA truly\nbuilding track, Dave\nand the instrumentation\nbecome one as the listener is guided through\nthe three main psyches\nthat Dave will expand on\nthroughout the album.\nNot only does he switch\nup his flow, content and\ndelivery with each transi-tion, but he does so whilst\ngiving us plenty of his\nsignature witty wordplay.\nHe sounds a fierce kind of\nbare initially, an energy\ncomparable to Stormzy\u2019s\n\u2018First Things First\u2019 over\nspacey moans and rattling\ndrums as he sharply spits:\n\u201cStop all the pain / Tell\nme how you stop all the\npain\u201d. This, as well as\nmany other bars in this\nalbum, serve as a reply\nto a therapist character,\nwhose conversational\nprompts appear between\nsongs, and at the very start\nof this one.

Dave has\nmany quotables throughout this album \u2013 such as\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do you\nand I (U-N-I), like I\u2019m\nin Leicester skipping my\nlectures\u201d \u2013 which will\nhave you screaming,\n\u201cRELOAD IT!\u201d - AD\n3. Black\nA single released\nbefore the album, \u2018Black\u2019\nis a thorough, nuanced\nand emotive delve into\nwhat it means to be black\nin Britain today. It\u2019s astounding how much Dave\nis able to cover in just\nthis one track. He goes\ninto social experience,\nheritage, history and\nmedia perception. - AR\nThis single is much\nbraver and hard-hitting\nthan some of Dave\u2019s\nearlier work. His reflections on race and identity\nare nuanced and mature.\n- SK\n4. Purple Heart\nThe production\ngoes super sweet here,\ncomplete with delicate\nbacking vocals and an\nacoustic guitar, as Dave\ndelivers a personal\nverse on his passionate\nyet mature approach to\nmatters of the heart. The\nwordplay on this track is\nparticularly impressive,\ncentering around star-signs, a deck of cards,\nand chess to conjure up\nthemes of chance, but also\nto accentuate Dave\u2019s point\nat the start of the track:\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking what it\u2019s\nlike to love, I told her\nlove\u2019s a game\u201d. - AR\nDave is really starting\nto open up now with\nreflections on his relation-ship. \u201cI\u2019ve got a Purple\nHeart / You\u2019ve got a\nPurple Heart\u201d he says, referring to accolades given\nto military who have been\ninjured in combat.

Drama\n\u2018Drama\u2019, though not\nexactly a bonus track,\nis a departure from the\nnarrative of the album, a\nself-contained stream of\nconsciousness addressed\ndirectly to Dave\u2019s brother\nwho is serving time in\nprison. The track starts\nand ends with a voicemail\nfrom Dave\u2019s brother,\nwhere he speaks about\nhow proud he is to have\nwitnessed Dave\u2019s rise to\nsuccess. He also implies\nthat Dave is destined\nto be the one to help\nhim through his mental\nsuffering (the therapy\nfocused theme of the\nalbum is in fact inspired\nby the therapy Dave\u2019s\nbrother is receiving in\nprison). Arguably the\nmost personal of a highly\npersonal album, the verse\non this song is divulg-ing, moving and highly\npensive. The bar that\nDave ends with succinctly\nbrings the entire album\nhome: \u201cI thank God for\nthe pain because it made\nme this\u201d. - AR\nThings get stripped\nback to a piano backing.\nThe vibe is smooth but\nthe subject matter sharp\nas Dave reflects on how\nhe is viewed by others.

You may have\nread in FT about how the\nFederal Reserve, the US\nCentral Bank has become\n\u201cdovish\u201d, due to its overly\n\u201chawkish\u201d stance last\nyear due to Trump\u2019s fiscal\npolicy. In this educational\narticle we will try and understand what this means.\ngrowth, such a case\noccurred in the chaos after\nthe 2008 financial crash.\nFiscal policy is largely\nbased on the ideas of\nthe British economist\nKeynes and involves the\ngovernment changing\nthe levels of taxation and\ngovernment spending\nin order to influence\nAggregate Demand and\nthe level of economic\nactivity. Keynes argued\nthat governments could\nstabilize the business\ncycle and regulate\neconomic output by\nadjusting spending and\ntax policies. Expansionary\nfiscal policy involves\nlowering taxes, giving\npeople more money to\nspend and invest. Firms\nwill hire more people,\ndecreasing unemployment\nand causing labour\ncompetition, thus raising\nwages. This has the\nsame effect as injecting\nmoney into the economy.\nIncreasing government\nspending means\nincreased investment\nin infrastructure, again\nincreasing employment.\nHowever, this will lead to\na deficit and often inflation\nand asset bubbles.\nFurthermore, while the\neffects of fiscal policy\nare usually profound, the\ntrickle-down time for the\ngeneral consumer is long\nand government spending\nis inefficient. Free market\neconomists argue that\nhigher government\nspending will tend to\nbe wasted on inefficient\nspending projects.\nOn Tuesday the\nWhite House released\nTrump\u2019s Fiscal Year\n2020 Budget Request. It\nfollows previous budget\nplans in lower regulation\nand tax on the financial\nindustry and increasing\ngovernment spending.\nThe record $4.7 trn annual\nbudget that boosts military\nspending and includes\n$8.6bn for US-Mexico\nborder wall.

If a central\nbank has a hawkish\nstance this has a positive\neffect on the country\u2019s\ncurrency, and prevents\nexcessive inflation but\nslows economic growth.\nThis is because increasing\ninterest rates increases\nthe cost of borrowing,\nincreasing the incentive\nto save rather than spend.\nA dovish stance has a\nnegative effect on the\ncountry\u2019s currency but\nstimulates economic\ngrowth and prevents\ndeflation.\nAnother tool a central\nbank might use is open\nmarket operations.

I didn\u2019t\nneed to labour\nthe point, and\nso kept the\nbook at under\n200 pages\u201d\nO\nn Monday\nMarch 4th,\nDr. Sunny\nBains from\nthe Department of\nBiochemical Engineering\nlaunched her new book\nExplaining the Future:\nHow to Research, Analyze\nand Report on Emerging\nTechnologies, published\nby Oxford University\nPress. The book \u2013 written\nfor engineers, physical\nscientists, consultants,\nand investors \u2013 focuses\non the how to determine\nand communicate the\nimpact of new processes,\nsystems, and devices.\nThe event itself was\nattended by more than\n70 people from across\nLondon and the South\nEast, including UCL staff\nand students, working\nengineers and consult-ants, tech journalists and\neditors, and academics\nfrom other universities.\nAccording to Bains,\none of the reasons she\nwrote the book was\nbecause she couldn\u2019t find\none to assign her students.\nBains remarked, \u201cthere\nwere lots of books writing\nreports on communication\nand a few on research,\u201d\nshe explained, \u201cbut I\ncouldn\u2019t find anything on\nhow to figure out whether\nor not a technology was\nvapourware. By putting\nall three of these elements\ntogether in one short book,\nI realized I could make a\nreal contribution.\u201d\nThe book starts with a\nchapter on the questions\nto answer when thinking\nabout whether a new tech-nologyislikelytosucceed,\nfollowed by chapters on\nvarious different types\nof sources \u2013 from online\njournals to conferences to\npress releases \u2013 and how\ntrustworthy they are likely\nto be. Chapter 4 focuses\non analysis and provides\na step-by-step process\nfor working through\napplications and potential\nsolutions.\nThe focus then shifts to\ncommunication, thinking\nthrough the audience, its\nmotivation, and the level\nof explanation needed.\nIn Chapter 6, Bains\nworks through the technical argument, a simple\nformula that can be used\nfor almost any applied\nscience or engineering\ndevelopment, as well as\nother layers of structure\nlike introductions and\nconclusions. The last\nchapter explains how to\nretain the audience\u2019s trust\nby providing the right kind\nof evidence and signposts.\nThere is also a case\nstudy (related to neuro-morphic engineering and\nmachine intelligence)\nwhere Bains works\nthrough all the elements\ncovered in the formal\nchapters of the book. She\nexplains in detail how she\napproached the research\nprocess and then includes\na final write-up at the end.\n\u201cIt sounds like a lot,\u201d\nsays Bains, \u201cbut I recognise that technical people\nare both busy and smart.\nThat meant I could say\nwhat I needed to without\nlabouring the point, and\nso to keep the book to\nunder 200 pages.\u201d\nBains is a Principal\nTeaching Fellow and\nteaches hundreds of\nstudents across various\nengineering departments,\nchemistry, natural\nsciences, and BaSc.\nIn particular, she has\nmodules on Technical\nJournalism for students\nat all levels, where she\nteaches all of the skills\ncovered in the book.\nBains worked as a tech\njournalist for more than\ntwo years herself, writing\nfor publications including\nThe Economist, Science,\nWired, EE Times, Laser\nFocus World, and many\nothers.\nAccording to Bains,\nshe has learned a huge\namount from teaching,\n\u201cKnowing how to do\nsomething is one thing,\nbut knowing how to teach\nit is something else. It\u2019s\ntaken me a long time to\nbe able to incorporate\nall of the questions and\nfeedback I\u2019ve had from\nstudents over the years so\nthat I can explain how to\ncommunicate in a simple\nand transparent way. I\ncouldn\u2019t have written this\nbook without them.\u201d\nAs well as teaching,\nBains is the Editorial\nDirector of Engineering\nInspiration, a mostly-cu-rated website that brings\ntogether the best technical\nnews from around the web\nand tags it so that users\ncan find what they\u2019re\nlooking for and customize\nit to their interests.\nSunny Bains talks about her new book, Explaining the Future, at the launch on Monday night // Dr Sunny Bains\nISSUE 1718\nFELIX\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10\nSCIENCE\nRosie Dutt\nScience Editor\nDinosaurs were thriving before asteroid strike that\nwiped them out\nSCIENCE\nHenry Alman\nScience Editor\nA\nnew analysis\nhas posited that\ndinosaurs were\nunaffected by\nlong-term climate changes\nand flourished before their\nsudden demise by asteroid\nstrike.\nScientists largely agree\nthat an asteroid impact,\npossibly coupled with\nintense volcanic activity,\nwiped out the dinosaurs at\nthe end of the Cretaceous\nperiod 66 million years\nago.\nHowever, there is\ndebate about whether dinosaurs were flourishing\nbefore this, or whether\nthey had been in decline\ndue to long-term changes\nin climate over millions of\nyears.\nPreviously, researchers\nused the fossil record\nand some mathematical\npredictions to suggest dinosaurs may have already\nbeen in decline, with the\nnumber and diversity of\nspecies falling before the\nasteroid impact.\nNow, in a new analysis\nthat models the changing\nenvironment and dinosaur\nspecies distribution\nin North America, researchers from Imperial\nCollege London, University College London\nand University of Bristol\nhave shown that dinosaurs\nwere likely not in decline\nbefore the meteorite.\nLead researcher Alessandro Chiarenza, a PhD\nstudent in the Department\nof Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial, said:\n\u201cDinosaurs were likely\nnot doomed to extinction\nuntil the end of the Cretaceous, when the asteroid\nhit, declaring the end of\ntheir reign and leaving\nthe planet to animals like\nmammals, lizards and a\nminor group of surviving\ndinosaurs: birds.\n\u201cThe results of our\nstudy suggest that dinosaurs as a whole were adaptable animals, capable\nof coping with the environmental changes and\nclimatic fluctuations that\nhappened during the last\nfew million years of the\nLate Cretaceous. Climate\nchange over prolonged\ntime scales did not cause\na long-term decline of\ndinosaurs through the last\nstages of this period.\u201d\nThe study, published in\nNature Communications,\nshows how the changing\nconditions for fossilisation\nmeans previous analyses\nhave underestimated the\nnumber of species at the\nend of the Cretaceous.\nThe team focused\ntheir study on North\nAmerica, where many\nLate Cretaceous dinosaurs\nare preserved, such as\nTyrannosaurus rex and\nTriceratops. During this\nperiod, the continent was\nsplit in two by a large\ninland sea. In the western\nhalf there was a steady\nsupply of sediment from\nthe newly forming Rocky\nMountains, which created\nperfect conditions for\nfossilising dinosaurs once\nthey died. The eastern\nhalf of the continent was\ninstead characterised by\nconditions far less suitable\nfor fossilisation.\nThis means that far\nmore dinosaur fossils\nare found in the western\nhalf, and it is this fossil\nrecord that is often used to\nsuggest dinosaurs were in\ndecline for the few million\nyears before the asteroid\nstrike.\nCo-author Dr. Philip\nMannion, from University\nCollege London, com-mented: \u201cMost of what\nwe know about Late Cretaceous North American\ndinosaurs comes from an\narea smaller than one-third of the present-day\ncontinent, and yet we\nknow that dinosaurs\nroamed all across North\nAmerica, from Alaska to\nNew Jersey and down to\nMexico.\u201d\nInstead of using this\nknown record exclusively,\nthe team employed \u2018ecological niche modelling\u2019.\nThis approach models\nwhich environmental\nconditions, such as temperature and rainfall, each\nspecies needs to survive.\nThe team then mapped\nwhere these conditions\nwould occur both across\nthe continent and over\ntime. This allowed them\nto create a picture of\nwhere groups of dinosaur\nspecies could survive as\nconditions changed, rather\nthan just where their\nfossils had been found.\nThe team found\nhabitats that could support\na range of dinosaur groups\nwere actually more widespread at the end of the\nCretaceous, but that these\nwere in areas less likely to\npreserve fossils.\nFurthermore, these\npotentially dinosaur-rich\nareas were smaller\nwherever they occurred,\nagain reducing the likelihood of finding a fossil\nfrom each of these areas.\nThis, the researchers\nclaim, is what initially led\nto the misinterpretation\nthat dinosaurs were on the\ndecline.\nSCIENCE\nFRIDAY, 15TH\nMARCH, 2019 FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nNew hepatitis C cases down by almost 70% in HIV\npositive men in London\nSCIENCE\nHenry Alman\nScience Editor\nN\new cases of\nhepatitis C\namongst HIV\npositive men\nin London have fallen\nby nearly 70 per cent in\nrecent years. The new\nanalysis of data from three\nclinics in London found\n256 men were diagnosed\nbetween 2013-2018. New\ninfections peaked at 17 for\nevery 1000 people studied\nin 2015 and fell to six by\n2018.\nThe researchers\nbehind the study, from\nthe Imperial College\nAcademic Health Science\nCentre, believe that\nregular screening and\nimproved access to new\ntreatments have contributed to greatly reducing\nthe transmission of the in-fection. They also believe\nthat if this progress can be\nmaintained London will\nbe on track to achieve\nthe targets set out by the\nBritish HIV Association\nto eliminate Hepatitis C in\nHIV patients by 2021.\nThe results were presented at The Conference\non Retroviruses and\nOpportunistic Infections,\na major HIV conference\nin Seattle, on Wednesday\n6 March.\nProfessor Graham\nCooke, NIHR Professor\nof Infectious Diseases at\nImperial College London\nand co-author of the\npaper, said:\n\u201cThe results from our\nstudy should give us great\nencouragement as we try\nto eliminate hepatitis C.\nThere is a risk that these\ngains might be reversed if\nwe can\u2019t retreat patients\nand we hope that soon this\nmight be possible through\nNHS services.\u201d\nPeople with HIV who\nget hepatitis C are more\nat risk of the disease\nprogressing and they have\na higher risk of cirrhosis\nand liver cancer. Hepatitis\nC is the leading cause of\nserious illness and death\nin people who are HIV/\nhepatitis C co-infected,\nattributing to six percent\nof all deaths.\nDespite this, under\ncurrent guidelines those\nrecently infected with\nhepatitis C have to wait\nsix months before they\ncan access DAA treatment\n\u2013 a recently-developed\ntreatment which is highly\neffective in 90% of\npatients. Also, if a patient\nis reinfected with hepatitis\nC they are not eligible for\na second course of DAA,\npotentially increasing the\nrisk of transmission.\nThe researchers suggest\nthat more screening,\nwider prescribing of hepatitis C therapies such as\nDAA tablets, and earlier\ntreatment of acute cases\nhave led to a decline in\nacute hepatitis C cases.\nHowever, the reduction\nof cases still falls short\nof the World Health Organisation\u2019s target of 90\nper cent and reinfections\nremain high. The team\nbelieve that there is an\non-going need to promote\nrisk reduction and design\nappropriate screening\npolicies for HIV positive\nmen.\nThe team is expanding\nthe study network to other\ncentres with the ambition\nof collecting data nation-ally.\n\u201cHepatitis C\nis the leading\ncause of death\nin people\nwho are HIV/\nhepatitis C coinfected\u201d\n\u201cDinosaurs as\na whole were\nadaptable\nanimals,\ncapable of\ncoping with\nenvironmental\nchanges and\nclimactic\nfluctuations\u201d\n\n"

The drums of war\nare at it again, this time in\nVenezuela, brought to you\nby the geniuses who also\nbrought you the Iraq war,\nsuch as John Bolton. The\nTrump administration and\ntheir lackeys in Europe\nhave defied international\nlaws and imposed an\nillegal embargo on the\nbesieged country. These\nneo-colonialist overlords\nwould have us believe\nthat their recognition of\nJuan Guaido as \u201cActing\nPresident\u201d is based on\ntheir commitment to\ndemocracy. What an outrageous claim! Western\ncountries have slobbered\nover one tyrant after\nanother \u2013 most notably\nMohamad Bin Salman\nthe crown prince of Saudi\nArabia who has launched\na brutal war on Yemen\nkilling hundreds of thousands of people. Britain\nandAmerica have not only\nrefused to condemn them,\nbut instead has facilitated\nthe Yemeni genocide by\nsupplying weapons to the\ntheocratic and totalitarian\nregime in Saudi Arabia.\nWhat election has the\nHouse of Saud won?\nVenezuela on the other\nhand is an actual imperfect\ndemocracy. Venezuela\u2019s\ncrime of keeping their oil\nwealth to themselves is\na crime the west cannot\nabide by. Since the\nBolivarian Revolution of\n1999, Hugo Chavez was\nelected to the presidency\nthree times with thumping\nmandates in the ballot\nbox. Each election has\nfaced tough scrutiny by\ninternational observers\n- from Jimmy Carter to\nthe United Nations - and,\neach time, the elections\nwere certified to be free\nand fair. In fact, in the last\npresidential election, the\nopposition implored international organisations\nto not come to Venezuela,\nbecause they knew it\nwould be certified and\nconsequently diminish\ntheir narrative.\nTo be fair, Chavez\u2019s\nsuccessor Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\nhas made many mistakes\nand has shown authoritarian tendencies. But\none cannot look at the hy-per-inflation, shortages of\nessentials or the political\ninstability in Venezuela\nin a vacuum. Britain\nhas seized 1.5 billion\ndollars of gold reserves\nthat Venezuela had in the\nBank of England. The US\nhas frozen the accounts of\nSITCO, the Venezuelan\nstate-owned oil company,\nand has diverted funds\nto American creditors\ninstead. The United\nNations official report\nhas said that the tactics\nemployed by this neo-co-lonial axis is nothing short\nof a \u201cmedieval siege -using starvation to obtain\nVenezuela\u2019s oil\u201d.\nFurthermore, if Venezuela is such a totalitarian\nregime then how was it\nthat whilst Maduro has\nbeen in power, the Venezuelan opposition gained\na super majority in the\nNational Assembly? What\nsort of dictatorship allows\nmass demonstrations?\nWhat sort of tyrant allows\na self proclaimed \u201cActing\nPresident\u201d to elicit foreign\nsupport whilst publicly\nadvocating the overthrow\nof the state? The Juan\nGuaido led opposition is\nnot a Gandhian non-vi-olent movement, but\nthey have thrown bricks\nand stones at the police\nand military, and incited\nviolence. Would any other\ngovernment allow a figure\nlike Guaido to walk the\nstreets with impunity,\nafter publicly conspiring\nto sell off the oil wealth of\nVenezuela to the highest\nforeign bidders, and\nopenly call for the military\nto commit treason and\nabandon the duly elected\ncivilian government.\nHistory may not repeat\nitself, but it does rhyme.\nIn 2002 the United\nStates tried to overthrow\nChavez in a coup. And\nnow, neo-cons like Elliot\nAbrams, who was a convicted felon due to his role\nin the Iran-Contra scandal\nand needed a presidential\npardon, are shepherding\nthis new regime change\nproject. And they have\nbeen greatly assisted by\nthe corporate media. Yes,\nrigging, but because the\nopposition didn\u2019t participate in them, knowing\nthey would loose.\nIt is clear that the government has committed\nmany economic blunders.\nIt is clear that there have\nbeen many arrests motivated not by justice but by\npolitical convenience. It is\nclear that Maduro has lost\nthe confidence of a significant section of the pop-ulation. But the Maduro\ngovernment must not be\noverthrown by the threat\nof a foreign sword at their\nneck. In the next election,\nthe opposition can not\nrefuse to participate. The\ninternational community,\nled by the United Nations\nmust be allowed to vigorously supervise the next\nelection, to ensure a free\nand fair process. And this\ncolonial alliance must stop\nthis immoral blockade of\nVenezuela.\nVenezuela communists back Maduro against pro-US right // Telesur\n\u201cTo be fair,\nChavez\u2019s\nsuccessor\nNicolas\nMaduro has\nmade many\nmistakes and\nhas shown\nauthoritarian\ntendencies\u201d\nthere have been large\nanti-Maduro demonstra-tions, but the media has\nconveniently ignored that\nthere were bigger concurrent pro-Maduro marches.\nThe media has failed to\nhighlight the reasons why\nMaduro had a sweeping\nvictory in the last election\nwas not because of vote\n\u201cThe drums\nof war are\nat it again,\nthis time in\nVenezuela\u201d\nPolitics Editor\n\n"

These are the\nthings that are occurring\nmore and more commonly\nin the rural areas of Japan.\nVarious methods were\nundertaken with varying\ndegrees of success, but\none remote village located\njust east of the mid-size\ncity of Wakayama came\nup with a brilliant idea\nthat would attract visitors\nfrom all around the world\nin numbers to this humble\nlittle village. So what was\nit that they did that was so\neffective?\nThey decided to put\na stationmaster at the\nterminus of the Kishigawa\nline, and a very special\none indeed. Why? Well\nfor a start, she\u2019s a cat.\nIt all started around\n2004 when the informal\nofficer in charge of the\nKishi train station, the last\ntrain stop served by the\nfading Kishigawa line in\nthe Wakayama prefecture,\nadopted a stray named\nTama and made her a\nlocal star. Since then,\nTama had been garnering\nattention and eventually\nhelped locals convince\nthe council to overturn the\ndecision to close down the\nline.\nThe tourism boost generated by the introduction\nof this feline friend only\ngrew bigger and not long\nafter, Tama was adorned\nwith gifts and honours\nfor her contribution to\nthe local society. Taking\nadvantage of Tama\u2019s\nfame, the Kishigawa line\nimproved its train services\nas well and as of today, the\nelectric-powered trains\nrunning along this route\nnow has 4 different quirky\ndesigns, where one of\nthem, the Tama Densha, is\ndedicated to Tama herself\nand contains a whopping\n101 Tamas drawn on the\nbody of the train.\nUnfortunately, Tama\npassed away in 2015,\npassing the baton of her\nlegacy to her understudy,\nNitama, or \u201cTama the\nSecond\u201d, to continue\ncarrying out \u2018super\u2019 sta-tionmaster duties. Tama\ncan rest assured that the\nstation is in safe paws,\nfor Nitama is not without\nexperience in this kind of\nwork, as she had already\nserved as the stationmaster\nof another small station,\nthe Idakiso station, which\nis 5 stops away from Kishi\nstation on the same Kishigawa line. Unlike Tama\nwho has short coat length\nand a rather dashing look,\nNitama is more on the\nfluffy side and exudes\nelegance, as shown in\ntheir respective adorable\ncartoon depictions.\nMost days, you would\nusually find Nitama\ndozing off in her spacious\nbox, rarely bothered\nby the flock of tourists\nadmiring her. You don\u2019t\nneed to worry about her\nwellbeing though as all\nshe\u2019s required to do is\nnap most of the time, like\nnormal domesticated cats\ndo, and every so often\nthroughout the day, she\nwould get a well-deserved\nfur brush and a tummy\nrub by the station officer\nwho is also in charge of\nthe merchandise shop.

On Tuesday she\nput her deal to another\nvote after getting further\nminor concessions from\nthe EU and still lost by\n149 votes. This was a\nhumiliating defeat. After\nslaving away all week-end, it was the attorney\ngeneral, the government\u2019s\ntop legal officer, who was\nher undoing. After tweaks\nto the Irish backstop, he\nwas still unable to say\nthat the backstop could\nbe left unilaterally by the\nUK. This was ultimately\nunacceptable to the DUP\nand Brexiteers in her party\nwho killed the deal.\nbut stated further that it\nwas still the legal default\nposition which could\nclearly be interpreted as\na way of trying to leave\nno deal on the table. The\nPrime Minister has used\nthe threat of no deal to\ntry and get remainers to\nsupport her deal at the\nrisk of falling off a cliff\nif they don\u2019t. Due to\nthis sting in the tail, an\namendment was tabled\nto the Prime Minister\u2019s\nmotion to remove this\nlast part to reinforce\nthat the Commons\nrejects no deal in all\nscenarios. Even though\nthe PM commanded the\nConservatives to vote\nagainst the amendment,\nit passed by a majority\nof a miserly 2 due to a\nrebellion by some Conservative MPs. This is\nwhen chaos descended.\nAt the beginning of the\nday, the government\nannounced the PM\u2019s\nmotion would be a free\nvote because of the\nobvious gaping chasm\nbetween those at the\ntop of her government\nwho think no deal would\nbe catastrophic, and\nthose who think it\u2019s a\nnecessary bargaining\nchip to be used with the\nEU. However, due to the\nsuccessful amendment,\nthe government told\nits MPs to vote down\nits own motion. There\nwere several senior\nministers who, rather\nthan vote against their\nconscience to remove\nno deal, decided to\nabstain on the motion.\nIn ordinary times, this\nwould mean that they\nwould be sacked immediately due to collective\nresponsibility. Collective responsibility is the\nidea that in government,\nall ministers agree to\nalways take the government line on any policy\nor vote in return for their\nposition as a minister\nto dictate policy. With\nthese abstentions this\nrejection of \u201cno deal\u201d\nwas approved by the\nCommons. Whilst this\nmotion has no legal\nforce and the UK could\nstill leave the EU on\nthe 29th March without\na deal, it is becoming\nincreasingly unlikely\nas it would require bad\nfaith on the side of the\ngovernment and the EU.\nThis vote was a clear\nsign of the PM\u2019s power\nslipping away further as\nshe can\u2019t even control\nher senior minister, let\nalone command a clear\nmajority in the House of\nCommons. Her authority has been shot and it\nis hard to see how she\ncan govern much further\nwith the total loss of discipline now within her\nown government. The\nonly quality Theresa\nMay appears to have as\na leader is her belliger-ence, and she will carry\non until she is removed,\nand she has now decided\nthe best course of action\nis to try and get her vote\nthrough for a third time.\nShe got her margin of\ndefeat down from 230 to\n149 between the last two\nas he poked and annoyed\npeople into submission.\nIn my opinion,\nTheresa May\u2019s Brexit\ndeal isn\u2019t that bad, all it\ndoes is set out the terms\nfor us leaving the EU and\nvery little, if anything,\nhas actually been\ndecided about our future\ntrading arrangements\nwith the EU. The Irish\nbackstop is a necessary\nmechanism to avoid a\nhard border between\nthe north and south of\nIreland, and most of\nthe opposition parties\naccept this, and this isn\u2019t\ntheir main contention\nwith the deal. The main\nproblem throughout has\nbeen trust, or a lack of\nit. If Theresa May had\nbrought Parliament\nalong at the very beginning of the process and\ngiven Parliament an opportunity to find where\na negotiated consensus\ncould lie, she could have\nnegotiated this with the\nEU and we would not be\nin this mess.\nTheresa May\u2019s\nstrategy may just about\nget her over the line\nby holding a gun to\neveryone\u2019s head in\nParliament, but I doubt\nit. In all likelihood she\nwill lose her vote again\nnext week perhaps by a\nsmaller margin of defeat,\nbut all this defeat will\nultimately do is waste\nyet more time. We are\nmerely 2 weeks from our\nplanned exit date which\nsurely has to be delayed\nnow, and we can\u2019t be\nwasting time on failed\nstrategies. The only\nthing that is becoming\nclearer by the day is this\nPM\u2019s ineptitude and the\nneed for her to go.\nTheresa May on the edge of disaster // Wikimedia\n\u201cThe main\nproblem\nthroughout\nhas been trust,\nor a lack of it\u201d\nvotes, so who can blame\nher for going again.\nPerhaps because what\nthe country needs isn\u2019t\nthe political equivalent\nof the \u201cdevil finger\u201d kid\nfrom CBBC, who would\nclaim his finger was\npossessed by the devil\nVanniasegaram\nPolitics Editor\n\u201cThe motion...\nstated that\nthe House\nof Commons\nrejects a no\ndeal Bexit\u201d\nOn Wednesday night,\nthere was a vote to \u201crule\nout\u201d no deal and this is\nwhere things got worse\nfor the Prime Minister.\nThe motion she put to\nParliament stated that\nthe House of Commons\nrejects a no deal Brexit,\n\n"

Its demo-like quality\nand cryptic lyrics may\ndiscourage new listeners,\nbut for fans of her previous work this serves as a\nfitting continuation of her\nmid-career reinvention.\nThe memory of listening to A Seat At The\nTable for the first time is\nstill vivid. Its cinematic\nquality and curated\ninterludes provided a\nlistening experience like\nno other as we drove\nthrough the boredom of\nthe swiss underpass. Its\ncultural significance to\nthe #BlackLivesMatter\nmovement cannot be\nunderstated, with tracks\nlike \u2018Don\u2019t Touch My\nHair\u2019 and \u2018Mad\u2019 piercing\nthrough the media noise\nlike a beacon in fog.\nCompared to her last\nLP, When I Get Home\ntakes a more languid\nand indirect manner to\nexpressing the inner\nworkings of her mind. If\nASATT\u2019s approach resembles the fast train at rush\nhour, this record is instead\nmore similar to a spacious,\nnocturnal journey on the\nOverground; from the\nopening track, the soul\nmaestro launches into a\nmelodic and beautifully\narranged cut, hypnotising\nthe listener with the\nlullaby-esque \u2018Things\nI Imagined\u2019. Moving\nforward, the album ma-terialises into a dreamy\nsoundscape, sprinkled\nwith puzzling samples\nand some very icy synths.\nStaying true to her\nroots is a key theme in this\nalbum, demonstrating Solange\u2019s insistence on not\nletting mainstream attention hinder her art. \u2018Down\nWith The Clique\u2019 serves\nas a PSA for not forgetting\nyour origins, with \u2018Stay\nFlo\u2019 commenting on the\nfickle characters present\nin the industry. Following\nup, she launches into\n\u2018Dreams\u2019, a standout\ntrack whose soothing\npiano melody overlays\na stunning vocal per-formance. This record\u2019s\nattention to composition\ncreates a wistful and\ntransporting environment\nthat is only heightened\nwith \u2018Almeda\u2019. A more\nrap-influenced track\nthanks to the work of\nPharrell on the boards,\nSolange\u2019s call to arms\nof the black community\ncombines a hazy instrumental feel with a more\nupbeat hook, although\nthis message is somewhat\ndiminished with one of\nPlayboi Carti\u2019s most\nuninspiring verses to date.\nAnother powerful track\non this album is \u2018Jerrod\u2019;\nThe lyrics are delivered\nmostly in disyllabic\nbursts, cutting through the\nstunning piano progression in the background.\nA lot of parallels can\nbe drawn between this\nrelease and Earl Sweatshirt\u2019s latest Some Rap\nSongs in terms of the use\nof samples. In both cases,\nthe vocal samples give a\nstream of consciousness\nfeel to the progression\nof the record, giving the\nsemblance of being one\nlong track. Moreover, the\nlyrics leave a lot to the\nimagination, but one can\u2019t\nhelp but feel that each\nword is carefully placed,\nwhich she alludes to with\nthe \u2018Nothing Without\nIntention (Interlude)\u2019.\nHowever, the repetitive\nnature of the album can\nsometimes take away\nfrom the listener\u2019s en-joyment, and the features\naren\u2019t capitalised on\nenough; Tyler the Creator\nand Sampha are only used\nbriefly and intermittently,\npreventing them from\nmaking a real impact on\nthe tracks they appear on.\nThe Gucci Mane feature\non \u2018My Skin My Logo\u2019\ncomes straight out of left\nfield and gives the song an\noddly duet-like feel.\nThe unpredictability of\nthis album really reflects\nthe soul singer\u2019s current\ncareer path, keeping the\nlistener guessing with\nevery move she makes.\nThe experimental period\nof her career is continuing\nto produce sonic gems\nand we can only hope for\nthe same with her next\nrelease.\nJustice has been served, and it sounds amazing\nS\no, I sit down in the\nWoodward study\nroom ready to sink\nmy teeth into some\nepidemiology, cut to three\nhours later and I finally\nstart working. This wasn\u2019t\nyour average YouTube/\nFacebook/ \u201creally\nneed to reply to these\nweek-old emails\u201d kind of\nprocrastination - this was\nJUSTICE!\nYou all know Justice,\nyou\u2019ve all heard\n\u2018D.A.N.C.E.\u2019 and you\u2019ve\nall enjoyed it. Every\nperson from everywhere\nloves that song, but did\nyou know they have other\namazing music too? The\nelectronic French duo\nhave produced a number\nof incredible songs over\nthe last decade that you are\nguaranteed to have heard\nat some point in your life:\n\u2018We Are Your Friends\u2019,\n\u2018Genesis\u2019, etc. I\u2019ve been a\nfan of their music for the\nlast few years but when I\nstumbled onto their 2018\nrelease Woman Worldwide\nI lost my tiny little mind.\nI\u2019m actually writing this\nwhile listening to the\nalbum for the first time, I\nhaven\u2019t even finished yet!\nI am certainly biased\nbecause I love them SO\nMUCH and this album is\na biggest hits type-thing.\nTake all their best bits over\nthe last ten years, have the\nperformers at the top of\ntheir game come hot off\nworldwide tours, and then\nconcentrate it down into\none continuous hour and\nhalf studio set - you get\nthis album.\nIt\u2019s fucking sublime.\nSorry but it\u2019s impossible for me to analyse this\nalbum with an objective\nlens. I refuse to do\nanything other than enjoy\nthis majesty of electronic\nenergy. If you want some\nactual proof that this is\ngood, then allow me to\ndirect your attention to the\nGrammy for Best Dance/\nElectronic Album of\n2018 \u2013 Woman Worldwide\n(duh). Yes, I know the\nGrammys are prone to\nbullshit (like how hell did\nMacklemore beat Kendrick\u2019s good kid, m.A.A.d\ncity in 2014 for Best Rap\nAlbum??) but Justice\u2019s\naward should at least be\nenough to convince you\nthat they\u2019re better than\ngood.\nThe French men work\nwith a foundation of\nvintage funk, disco and\nhouse, but also take influence from prog, metal,\nnew wave, indie, and a hell\nof a lot more. That\u2019s all I\nwant to say about them.\nNow go forth children!\nListen to this album, experience the beauty, and\nthen tell me how much I\noverhyped it.

But no matter how\nhot Ferrari are looking, in\nmy heart I doubt that the\naction on the black asphalt\nof Albert Park will be able\nto overshadow what\u2019s\nhiding in the grooves of\nthe new Pond LP. Here\u2019s\nwhy.\nThe sounds and stories\nof Australia\u2019s biggest\npsych rock bands have\nalways been intertwined.\nAs Kevin Parker, Jesus\nin Sandals\u2122 and most\nprominent representative\nof said bands, once noted:\n\u201cThere is no Australian\npsych rock scene, we\u2019re\njust ten people.\u201d For\nTame Impala and Pond,\nthe merging of sound has\nmuch to do with the fact\nthat they used to, and to a\nlesser extent still do, share\nband members. KP used\nto play drums for Pond,\nPond\u2019s Nick Allbrook\nused to tour with Tame\nImpala, Pond\u2019s Shiny Joe\nRyan does Tame Impala\u2019s\nvisuals, and Jay Watson\nis the last throbbing\nartery connecting these\nbands with crossover\nroots \u2013 and is a permanent\nmember of both bands.\nMost importantly, Kevin\nParker has produced all of\nPond\u2019s albums; all of this\nis crucial to understanding\nthe transition in Pond\u2019s\nsound that started with the\nrelease of Man It Feels\nLike Space Again in 2015,\nand has finally completely\nblossomed in Tasmania.\nTo me, Pond has always\nbeen the slightly wonkier\nlittle sister of Tame\nImpala. There are several\nreasons for that \u2013 from Albrook\u2019s dodgy hair colour\nchoices to their sometimes\noverdistorted sounds and\nflippant titles (calling an\nalbum Hobo Rocket and a\nsong \u2018Heroic Shart\u2019 might\nunintentionally give that\nimpression). Perhaps it is\nbecause Pond are more of\nan actual band than Tame\nImpala (where Kevin\u2019s\nsingular vision is the\ndriving force, resulting\nin a very homogenized\nmusical product) that their\nalbums have historically\nbeen a bit more all-over-the-place and in-your-face. This album changes\nthat somewhat, bringing a\nmore polished sound.\nin a land where \u201cit\u2019s spring\nand the cherry blossoms\nsprout,\u201d with \u201cfires\nbejewelling the South\nWest\u201d. All of a sudden,\nwe\u2019re told our subject is\n\u201csmiling like he has to for\nthe cause, for the tribe, for\nthe boys, for the lie\u201d and\njust like that the drums\ncome in and the rest of the\nsong unfolds as a combination of a punchy, upbeat\nmelody and lyrics that\nrange from slightly uncomfortable to borderline\nmorbid. \u201cMe and the men\nof the frontier stack the\nbodies in a heap / Jimmy\ngrabs a beer and we wash\nour hands in a creek,\u201d\nevokes the image of a\ndeath factory. It hints at\nthe reciprocal relationship\nof \u201cwe clean ourselves\nby implicating nature in\nour filth\u201d. Ah, that filthy\nblack soul of capitalism.\nI should also mention that\nwith the synths jumping\nup and down the chorus,\nthey have definitely taken\na leaf out of Currents\u2019\nbook. These elements are\na perfect prelude for the\nrest of the album.\n\u2018Sixteen Days\u2019 is not\none of the most noteworthy tracks on the album,\nbut it does contain a line\nwhich goes to show that\nthe band hasn\u2019t given\nup on shitstirring lyrics\ncompletely \u2013 \u201cnow I know\nhow a suckerfish feels,\nshit, I better call my Dad.\u201d\nLovely! Next, the title\ntrack gives us some clues\nas to the album\u2019s name.\nIn the first two verses, the\nrhymes are too obvious\nand lazy to be that way accidentally \u2013 perhaps critiquing sloppy songwriting\nand empty meanings in\nmodern music? Anyway,\nour subject wants a break\nin \u2018Tasmania\u2019: \u201cI left my\nphone in Sydney / All\nthe stress outdid me,\u201d\nsomething which he later\nwishes for again in \u2018Burnt\nOut Star\u2019.\n\u2018The Boys Are Killing\nMe\u2019, is one of my quiet\nfavourites on the album.\nThe tempo, Nick\u2019s\ndiction, and the thickness\nof sound mediated by the\neffects used, change so\nmany times that the song\nfeels like a ruler twisted\ninto the figure 8 \u2013 taut to\nthe extreme but remaining unbroken. \u201cDrunk\nbut overjoyed just to be\nemployed / By the boys\n/ The boys are killing\nme\u201d reads as if written\nby someone coexisting in\na toxic society but glad\njust to fit in \u2013 a paradox\nof wanting change but not\nwanting to be left out for\ninstigating it. Yikes!\nIn \u2018Hand Mouth\nDancer\u2019, the political\nnature of the album\u2019s\nlyrics is addressed, playfully acknowledging the\nhypocrisy that sometimes\ngoes hand in hand with\npoliticisation of music,\nand the people who\ndemand it. \u2018Burnt Out\nStar\u2019 is this album\u2019s epi-centre, the magnum opus,\nhaving been released as a\nsingle long ago (so long\nmany thought it would be\na standalone single). It is\na journey through sound,\nflashing some wonderfully poetic lines on the\nway. \u201cBurnt out star, no\nmatter where you are / try\nto understand you\u2019re only\na man\u201d suggests that mankind\u2019s collective strength\nshould come from a\nrealisation of individual\nweakness. A potent lesson\nhidden amongst woozy\nad-libs of the number 1917\n\u2013 I guess the burnt out star\nthey\u2019re thinking of is of\nthe RED variety\u2026 This\nis to be the first allusion\nto revolution as a possible\nsolution to the problems\nthe band perceive; the\nother solution (escape?) is\ncarnal desire \u201cOh perfect\nbody that they\u2019ll never\ntear apart / first they\u2019ll\nhave to tear my head from\nROOYGGGBBBII // Spinning Top\n\u201cLittle\nsnippets from\na daydream,\nfloating on a\nstark blue sky\u201d\nMUSIC\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Pond.

    "content": "The sun is setting on animal agriculture // Teri James Photography\nIs it the end of the road for livestock farming?\nProduction of animal products is responsible for over three quarters of agricultural land usage, a major emitter of\ngreenhouse gases and a key driver of deforestation\nSUSTAINABILITY\nElliot Dryer-Beers\nSustainability Writer\nC\no n v e r s a t i o n s\ns u r r o u n d i n g\nhuman contributions to global\nwarming are naturally\nfraught with confusion\ndue to the sheer enormity\nand complexity of the\nissue, but can also be\ntwisted by those whose\nproximal goals conflict\nwith the changes necessary to address it.\nOne such point of\nconfusion frequently\nused to mask the true\nconsequences of animal\nagriculture is its impact\non the emissions of\ngreenhouse gases (GHGs)\nincluding methane \u2013 an\noften overlooked but intensely important contributor to global warming.\nA recent example of\nthis was seen during\nan exchange between\nanimal rights activist\nEd Winters, \u2018Earthling\nEd\u2019, and Phil Stocker,\nCEO of the National\nSheep Association, on\nVictoria Derbyshire\u2019s\nBBC 2 show. During the\nsegment, Mr. Stocker\nnoted the longstanding\ncriticism of ruminant\nanimals including cattle\nand sheep regarding their\nproduction of methane\nas a by-product of diges-tion. However, he then\nproceeded to dismiss it,\nclaiming this production\nis simply \u201cpart of a natural\ngaseous cycle\u201d that the\nEarth has \u201cadapted to\ncope with\u201d over thousands of years. This was\nexemplified again during\na conversation on The\nBig Questions, also featuring Ed, when a butcher\nspeaking in defence of\nfarming practices skipped\nover the issue of methane\nemission entirely while\npraising the carbon-stor-ing properties of the\ngrasslands that constitute\nmuch of the land used in\nUK agriculture. The labelling of such emissions\nfrom livestock as \u2018natural\u2019\nand therefore not worthy\nof concern, or neglecting\nto mention them at all, is\nmisguided at best, if not\nnefarious when the true\nimplications considered.\n\u201cIn terms of\ntheir global\nwarming\npotential,\nmethane\noutscores CO2\nby a factor of\nup to 28 to 1\u201d\n\u201c80% of\ndeforested\nareas in Brazil\nis currently\nbeing used for\npasture\u201d\nGreenhouse gases often\nfall under the same rubric\nin debates concerning\nenvironmental issues, but\nare anything but similar\nin their effects. Methane,\nit is true, is shorter-lived\nthan CO2\nand makes up\na comparative minority\nof total greenhouse gas\nemissions, clocking in at\n16% of global emissions\ncompared to 76% from\nCO2\n, as reported by the\nIntergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change\n(IPCC) in 2014. However,\nin terms of their global\nwarming potential (a\nmeasure of the relative\ncapacity of a gas to absorb\nradiation emitted from\nthe Earth\u2019s surface, preventing it from escaping\nand thus warming the\nplanet) methane outscores\nCO2\nby a factor of up\nto twenty eight to one.\nConsider this alongside\nthe fact that agriculture is\nconsistently ranked as one\nof the largest sectors (if\nnot the largest sector) in\nterms of its contribution\nto methane emissions, and\nthe severity of the issue\nstarts to become apparent.\nAnimal agriculture\ncontributes to climate\nchange in numerous\nways, but among the\nmost notable is its status\nas a leading cause of de-forestation. This clearing\nof rich and diverse areas\nof plant life to make way\nfor land on which cattle\ncan graze, and where food\ncan be grown and fed to\nlivestock, is perhaps most\nfamed for its devastation\nof the Amazon rainforest.\nDeforestation in this\nregion hit its highest rate\nin a decade last year,\nwith nearly 8,000 square\nkilometres being cleared.\nCattle ranching is now\nconsidered to be its most\nsignificant cause, and\nnearly 80% of deforested\nareas in Brazil (which\ncontains approximately\n60% of the rainforest) are\ncurrently used for pasture.\nWhilst this is a potent\nexample of the motivations behind these activities and of the enormous\nproportions of land used\nfor nothing but raising\nand feeding livestock,\nthis is hardly an extreme\nexample when considered\nglobally. 77% of the\nworld\u2019s agricultural land\nis currently used for livestock farming purposes\nincluding growing crops\nfor animal feed, while in\nthe UK the production of\nanimal-based products\nmakes up 85% of the land\nfootprint.\nThis issue of land use\nreally takes us to the\nheart of the issue and\nhighlights the hypocrisy\nand near-sightedness\nof skimming over the\nnegative consequences of\nanimal agriculture including methane emissions,\nand of characterising the\nside effects of our massively overinflated livestock trade as something\nnatural. It is true that CO2\nemissions exceed those of\nmethane, but its removal\nfrom the atmosphere\ndepends directly on processes which are inherently compromised by the\nmass raising of livestock.\nThis occurs via carbon\nsequestration: the process\nby which CO2\nis removed\nfrom the atmosphere\nand stored by forests,\ngrasslands and other\nsuch areas, with forests\nhaving the advantage of\ngreater above-ground\nbiomass per area of earth,\nmeaning they may serve\nas better long-term carbon\nsinks than grasslands. A\nrecent study from Oxford\nuniversity concluded\nthat excluding animal\nproducts from one\u2019s diet\ncan reduce emissions associated with their food\u2019s\nproduction by 49%, and\nthat the land required for\nfood production could be\nreduced by 76% if such a\ndiet was adopted globally.\nAlongside this, a recent\nNature paper which was\nconsidered the most\ncomprehensive study to\ndate of the environmental\nconsequences of food\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 15TH\nMARCH, 2019 FELIX\nartur.donaldson15@imperial.ac.uk\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 15TH\nMARCH, 2019 FELIX\nartur.donaldson15@imperial.ac.uk\nproduction recommended\ndrastic decreases in our\nconsumption of meat,\ndairy and eggs, accompanied by increased consumption of plant-derived\nfoods such as beans, nuts\nand seeds to counteract\ndrivers of climate change.\nClimate scientists\nrecently warned that we\nhave around twelve years\nto backpedal our impact\nto cap the ongoing temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C \u2013\nthe maximum that can be\ntolerated to avoid the most\ncatastrophic projections\nof continued warming.\nEven assuming this target\nis met, however, the forecasts are grim. The World\nHealth Organisation has\nestimated a rise of 95,000\nchild deaths per year\ndue to malnutrition, and\n60,000 extra deaths from\nmalaria worldwide, while\nupwards of 100 million\npeople could be plunged\ninto extreme poverty\naccording to the IPCC.\nReports from these organisations and others including the Tyndall Centre for\nClimate Change Research\nfurther estimate that up to\n150 million people may\nbe affected by drastic\nsea level rises during the\ncoming century. Ocean\nacidification due to dissolved CO2\ncould also\nhave devastating effects,\nwith a predicted 70-90%\ndecline in existing coral\nreefs \u2013 a major source of\nfood and protection to\npeople as well as a host of\ndiverse marine life.\nDoing everything we\ncan to reduce our current\nimpact on the planet is\nimperative to minimise\nthese consequences to as\nlarge a degree as possible,\nand reducing our reliance\non animal agriculture is\namong the most logical,\nnot to mention ethical,\nplaces to start. And in\ncase the information\nabove isn\u2019t enough of an\nincentive, the benefits\nof making such changes\nare by no means limited\nto counteracting global\nwarming. Increased food\navailability resulting\nfrom the redistribution of\ncrops to humans instead\nof livestock, which results\nin a much lower yield of\nfood production, could\nmean an end to world\nhunger given a permitting political climate.\nAdditionally, a host of\npowerful medicines may\nremain to be discovered in\nthe diminishing rainforest,\nsupplementing the current\nlist including Quinine, a\nmedication used to treat\nmalaria, and Vincristine\nand Vinblastine \u2013 compounds used in cancer\ntreatments to prevent cells\nfrom dividing.\nOne thing is for sure \u2013\nthere is nothing \u2018natural\u2019\nabout the levels of emissions currently generated\nby raising livestock.\nRather, it is one of the\nmain factors endangering\neverything that is.\n\u201c77% of\nthe world\u2019s\nagricultual\nland is used\nin livestock\nfarming\u201d\nData from the UN shows the vast majority of agricultural land used around the world is either used for rearing livestock or producing food for livestock, not humans // UN, Our World in Data\n\n"

It also marks a\ngood time to address the\ncounselling service.\nbehaviours are explored\nand focused on at your\nown pace. The aim is\nto bring a greater understanding of current\ndifficulties and identify\nthemes or patterns that you\nwould like to change. You\ncan expect a counsellor to\ngive you time and space to\ntalk about your thoughts.\nYou can expect them to\nask questions and together\nyou\u2019ll think about what\ndifficulties you\u2019re having\nand talk about alternative\nperspectives of situations.\nCounsellors will talk with\nyou about what you want\nto change and together you\nwill look at mechanisms\nto change your behaviour\nand thoughts.\nCounselling is not\ngiving advice or attempting to sort out the\nproblems of a student, it\ndoesn\u2019t give a diagnosis\nor treatment. Counsellors\ndon\u2019t expect a student to\nbehave in any particular\nway and they won\u2019t get\nemotionally involved with\nthe student. Counselling\nwill not give you answers\nand fix the problem.\nInstead you work together to understand the\ndifficulties and talk about\nstrategies to change this.\nSometimes it can be\ndifficult to see what a\ncounsellor actually does.\nCounsellors are trained to\nlisten so that they listen to\nwhat is being said but also\nthe underlying subtleties.\nThey can identify pat-terns, themes or feelings.\nCounsellors don\u2019t judge\nand they want to help you\nunderstand. Counsellors\nare particularly valuable\nbecause humans are\nrelational creatures and\nthey are meant to interact\nwith other people and\nform a variety of relation-ships. This means during\ntimes of stress we need\na relational approach.\nTalking to someone who\nlistens and helps us to\nunderstand our feelings,\nthoughts and behaviours.\nPeople often prefer to\nspeak to counsellors than\nfamily, friends, lecturers\nor personal tutors. They\naren\u2019t biased and they\nwon\u2019t judge you. They\nwon\u2019t get emotionally\ninvolved, which family\nand friends tend to, but\nthey do care. They bring\na level of support and\nunderstanding that these\nother people can\u2019t bring.\nsome people and while\nit can be incredibly effective at helping people\nunderstand thoughts and\nbehaviours, it can bring\nabout different emotions\nin different individuals.\nFor many people counselling means letting go\nof thoughts or behaviours\nand that can be really\ndifficult. This is normal\nand everyone who visits\nthe counselling service\nshould expect a very personal experience from the\nsessions they attend.\nThis is not to say\nthat counselling doesn\u2019t\nmassively help people.\nMost students that use\nthe counselling service\nfind it hugely beneficial\nto have that time to talk\nand think. It allows them\nto cope with their daily\nlife and study effectively.\nThey go on to achieve\nthe grades they want to\nand participate in all the\nactivities that they wish\nto. Counselling really can\nmake a huge difference to\nyour life and I encourage\nyou to reach out if you\nneed support.\nIn fact, I should address\n\u201cWhat is\ncounselling\nand what does\nit mean for\nyou and other\nstudents at\nImperial?\u201d\nthe importance of asking\nfor help. Asking for help\ndoes not make you weak;\nit is one of the strongest\nthings you can do. As a\nchild we are often taught\nto do it by ourselves:\neating, getting dressed\nand brushing your teeth.\nWhen learning how to\ndo these things, someone\nguided you, told you\nhow to do it and helped\nyou when you struggled.\nAt university there are\nfurther pressures to do\nthings yourself: washing\nclothes, cooking, cleaning\nand studying. It is still\nfine to ask for help with\nthese things. Speaking\nto friends, family, tutors\nand support services may\nseem like a huge step but\nit is so important and will\nmake a huge difference to\nyour life.\nCounselling at\nThe Under Pressure campaign, which aims to give students strategies for coping during periods of heightened\nstress, returns on 18th\n- 22nd\nMarch\nCheck out what's on throughout the Under Pressure campaign // Imperial College Union\nThis session will give\nyou time to talk about\nyour concerns and think\ntogether about what your\nneeds are. You\u2019ll decide\ntogether if counselling is\nthe best option or be signposted to a service that\nsuits your needs more.\nYou may decide together\nsome strategies that\nyou can use before your\nnext session. You will\nthen get three ongoing\nappointments that last for\n50 minutes. After this you\nwill decide together how\nbest to use your remaining\nfour sessions. You may\nEveryone has seen\nfilms where someone\ngoes to a counsellor or\na therapist and lies on a\ncouch and tells their story.\nThe therapist asks \u201cAnd\nhow do you feel about\nthat?\u201d before \u201cfixing\u201d the\nindividual who then skips\nout of the room, to find the\nlove of their life and live\nhappily ever after. With\nimages like this floating\naround it can be difficult\nto really understand what\ncounselling is; so what is\ncounselling and what does\nit mean for you and other\nstudents at Imperial?\nCounselling is a confidential and non-judge-mental space in which\nthoughts, feelings and\n\u201cCounselling is\na confidential\nspace in which\nthoughts,\nfeelings and\nbehaviours are\nexplored\u201d\n\u201cPeople often\nprefer to speak\nto counsellors\nthan family,\nfriends,\nlecturers\nor personal\ntutors\u201d\n\u201cAsking for\nhelp does\nnot make you\nweak\u201d\n\u201cThe\ncounselling\nservice offers\nshort term\ntherapy,\nmeaning\na limited\nnumber of\nsessions over a\nshort period of\ntime\u201d\nand emotions. It doesn\u2019t\naddress how you interact\nwith other people which\ncan sometimes be a useful\nfactor to consider. Speak\nto your GP or visit the\nHealth Centre as they can\ndirect you to that service.\nThe NHS also offer IAPT\n(Improving Access to\nPsychological Therapies)\nwhich can have shorter\nwaiting times and can be\neasy to access. It can be\nreally useful and is worth\nexploring.\nAnother useful tool is\nMindfulness. Mindfulness teaches you to pay\nattention to the present\nmoment though breathing\nand meditation practices.\nEveryone benefits from\nMindfulness but it can particularly help if you feel\nstressed or overwhelmed,\nare struggling to concentrate or are feeling like\na failure. It can help you\nmanage your thoughts so\nyou can accept them and\ndisengage from negative\nthinking or worrying.\nThe Chaplaincy offers\nsessions on Mindfulness\nwhich can help you learn\nabout the practice. This is\nnot just for students who\nidentify with a religion or\nfaith.\ndecide to leave them\nuntil later on in the year\nfor stressful periods, for\nexample scheduling them\nto be just before exams.\nCounselling services\nintegrated into higher education are becoming increasingly oversubscribed\nand are being found to\nhave long waiting times.\nThis can be detrimental\nto students who need\naccess to that support\nbut in some ways it\u2019s an\nindication that the stigma\nof mental health is being\nreduced and students are\naware of their mental\nhealth and thinking about\nways to support it. To\neveryone that reaches out\nto the counselling service\nI\u2019m really proud of you,\nit can be a huge step to\nrecognise that you need\nhelp and then to actually\nseek it as well is fantastic.\nParticularly when there\nare long waiting times\nit can be worth thinking\naboutalternativesthatmay\nprovide some support.\nCognitive behavioural\ntherapy (CBT) can be accessed through the NHS.\nCBT largely looks at how\nyou process information,\nhow it is stored, used and\nhow it affects behaviours\n\u201cCounselling\nservices\nintegrated\ninto higher\neducation\nare becoming\nincreasingly\nover-subscribed\nand are being\nfound to have\nlonger waiting\ntimes\u201d\nUnlike many other\nuniversities across the\nUK, College has backed\nthe counselling service\nand has put extra funding\ninto the service in order to\nincrease the staff resourc-es. Staff numbers will\nbe increased throughout\nthe academic year which\nshould have an impact on\nthe waiting times. This\nis taking longer than it\nshould have due to limited\nspace, but the service is\ndoing all that it can to see\nas many students as possible and cut the waiting\ntimes down. It\u2019s massively frustrating for students\nnot to have access to this\nservice because there is\nnot enough space for them\nto use. The service has the\nresources to expand but\nthe College has not provided the space and this is\nunacceptable. Wellbeing\nshould be everyone\u2019s\nproblem so this is a call to\nCollege to find the counselling service the space\nso that students can access\nthe support they need.\nCollege also needs to\nunderstand the impact a\nfully functioning service\ncan have on the student\nbody as a whole. More\nfunding would give more\ncapabilities for group\nsessions and workshops\nto get students thinking\nabout their mental health\nearly on. Wellbeing\nshould be incorporated\ninto the curriculum so that\nall students learn about\nit, are aware of it and can\nput coping mechanisms in\nplace should they experience difficulties.\nCounselling can be a\npainful experience for\nImperial\nWhile this explains\ncounselling in general it\ncan be useful to understand what happens at\nthe counselling service at\nImperial. The counselling\nservice offers short term\ntherapy, meaning a limited\nnumber of sessions over a\nshort period of time. This\nis for two reasons. Firstly,\nshort term therapy can\nbe particularly effective\nfor the demographic at\nuniversity. This is because\ncounselling can require\npeople to be accepting of\nchange and open minded\ntowards alternative perspectives of a situation.\nStudents at university are\nalready experiencing a\nlot of change. This means\nthey can accept change\nmore willingly which can\nmake it particularly ef-fective. The other reason\nthat short term therapy\nis offered is to ensure\nthere is provision for all\nstudents at Imperial.\nThe service has also\nchanged the way they\noffer appointments. The\ninitial appointment is a\ntherapeutic consultation\nthat is up to 75 minutes.\n\n"

With runners wearily boarding\nthe convenient Oxford\nTube at Notting Hill or\nShepherd\u2019s Bush, the\nbanter slowly ramped\nup with Union and Club\npolitics dominating con-versation. In between the\npredictions and political\nmaneuvering, the Imperial\nteams were boshed out\ntactically for optimal\noverall performance (this\nwould later be proved to\nbe a wise choice).\nAs the avid competitors\napproached the famous\nRoger Bannister track\n(location of the first ever\nmile under 4 minutes), the\nweather started to look a\nbit British.\nThe wind was whipping\nup and some spray was\nbeginning to dampen the\nconfident mood of the\nrunners. Yet as the race\nstarted, the girthy support\nfrom ICXCAC\u2019s travelling fans left nothing to\nbe desired in the way of\nbelly-fire raising encour-agement.\nFormer Club Chair,\nAlex Mundell, started the\nMixed A team off with a\nbang, with a run just shy\nof the top men starting for\nother mixed teams.\nThe momentum continued with star runner\nGeorgia Curry running the\n3rd fastest female 7km leg\nof the day.\nAs the baton was\nhanded to Ollie Newton,\nOxford\u2019s Mixed A had a\nreasonable lead but had\nused a male runner on\ntheir second leg.\nOllie smashed out a\nfantastic leg - even if he\nwasn\u2019t completely happy\nwith it - to put Imperial\nin the lead by just over\na minute as the baton\nwas handed over to Niki\nFaulkner who would give\neverything to hold off\nOxford\u2019s sub-15-for-5k\nman on the last leg.\nAs it happened, he\nhad a massive leg and\nwon Imperial the overall\nmixed competition by 24\nseconds.\nIn the Men\u2019s competi-tion, Club Chair Fergus\nJohnson, James Millet,\nMisi Ormay and Henry\nHart all ran solid times to\ncome second in the overall\ncompetition, tactically\nover 6 minutes behind\nOxford A and just seconds\nahead of Oxford B.\nThe Imperial Women\nput in a valiant performance to finish 16th ahead\nof teams like Oxford\nBrookes and Abingdon\nAC A teams.\nParticularly of note\nwas Treasurer Nathalie\nPodder\u2019s successful\ncompletion of 7k having\nrecently graduated from\nWomen\u2019s Captain Charlotte Barratt\u2019s Couch-to5k program.\nAfter the race, the\nrunners descended on\nTeddy Hall\u2019s canteen for\nsome dubious sandwiches\nand the awards ceremony.\nInevitably, this led on to\na post-race Oxford spoons\n(fork handles?) and night\nout were well attended\nwith plenty of colourful\nbeverages and dubious\nrumours of sightings of\nthe notorious Wealdstone\nRaider.\nThe club\u2019s beloved\nmegaphone was also lost\nto a bush after it transpired\nloudspeakers were not\npermitted in club\u2019s. Ah\nwell, it had a good run.\nCross Country & Athletics bring home more silverware - this time from Oxford.\nLeading the way: Club Captain Fergus Johnson leads out the first leg of the Men\u2019s race // Barry Cornelius\nGone but not forgotten: The last known sighting of the\nclub\u2019s megaphone - a bush in Oxford // ICXCAC\nStrong start: Douthwaite\nbegins his lap // ICXCAC\n\n"

The\nwords of encouragement\nare moving, constructive,\nand, to me, show that the\nband realises that simply\npainting a picture of all\nthe shitstains present all\naround isn\u2019t the point of\ngreat art.\nThe point is to be able\nto point to a power of\nrenewal, a replenishing\ngreatness which is just\nwaiting to be found in\nthe nature that surrounds\nus, to give clues as to\nwhat might be able to\nmake everything better.\nAnd though in Daisy\nthey sing \u201csometimes\nyou gotta rock the cradle\non your own\u201d, the rest of\nthe album convinces us\nthat in that cradle there is\nhidden the potential for all\nthat\u2019s good in the world.\nAnd that it will come true.\n\u201cBut don\u2019t be defeated\nby the coming night / By\nthe wind that\u2019s blowing\nas cold as ice.\u201d Pond, I\npromise I won\u2019t!

Despite\nonly receiving my backing\nin earnest following their\nthird album (2013\u2019s Holy\nFire), they soundtracked\nsuch a pivotal part of my\nadolescence that for me,\nas far as British indie\nmusic was concerned,\nthey were everything.\nDropping in 2008,\ndebut album Antidotes\nfeatured angular guitars,\noccasional brass interjec-tions, and largely nonsensical lyrics (including\nsome in French), making\nit a bizarre but undeniably\nfun math rock piece.\n2010\u2019s Total Life Forever\nbrought a different band\nentirely. Crisp, funk-in-flected rhythms ushered in\na far more mature sound,\nand frontman Yannis\nPhilippakis showed\nthe full wonder of his\nvoice, particularly on\nthe record\u2019s epic centre-piece, \u2018Spanish Sahara\u2019.\nHaving won acclaim, they\ndecided to go big. The\nmuscular, anthemic rock\nof follow-up Holy Fire\nwas a chart success, and\npaved the way for huge\nheadline sets.\nThey\u2019d found their\nwinning formula and so\nthey, in what I imagine\nthey\u2019d thought was a\nsensible move, nigh on\nreplicated it for 2015\u2019s\nWhat Went Down.\nSadly, for many (myself\nincluded, just a month\nbefore starting university)\nsomething was lacking.

Given the\nmixed reviews, combined\nwith their reputation as\none of the best live bands\naround, it\u2019s no surprise\nthat they dedicated the\nfollowing few years to\nfull albums, Everything\nNot Saved Will Be Lost,\nparts 1 and 2, the second\nof which is anticipated to\ndrop in September.\nFrom the ethereal\nsynths that open the LP\nwith \u2018Moonlight\u2019, it\u2019s immediately clear that this\nis something new. Well\naware of the ever-loos-ening hold guitar music\nhas on today\u2019s musical\nlandscape, Philippakis\nand co. have allowed\nelectronic and experimental techniques to permeate\nthe record. At their most\nprominent, \u2018In Degrees\u2019\nis borderline disco, and\nwouldn\u2019t feel out of place\nin a Hot Chip set, while\nthe tinkling vibraphones\nand distant wails of \u2018Caf\u00e9\nD\u2019Athens\u2019are reminiscent\nof Moon Shaped Pool-era\nRadiohead.\nThere is some familiarity though; the throbbing\nstadium rock of \u2018White\nOnions\u2019 is sure to become\na staple of their live sets,\nafter stagnating for three\nminutes, \u2018Syrups\u2019 gives\nus that cymbal-crashing\nshift of gear that Foals\nare known and loved for,\nand the chirpy, textured\nbounce of \u2018On the Luna\u2019\nsounds like every song off\nTotal Life Forever played\nat once.\nIt all culminates in\nthe penultimate track\n\u2018Sunday\u2019, a two-part\nodyssey that swings from\nmelancholic slow burner\nto 90s rave, before lullaby\n\u2018I\u2019m Done With the World\n(& It\u2019s Done With Me)\u2019\nrounds off the album. It\u2019s\nnot without imperfections\n\u2013 the album version of\n\u2018Exits\u2019 lingers, making\nit somewhat less punchy\nthan its single counterpart,\nand despite its efforts, the\nradical change is not all\nthat extreme. But, for me\nat least, it\u2019s served as a\nstrong reminder of why I\nfell in love with them in\nthe first place. Bring on\npart 2.\nMUSIC\nAdrian LaMoury\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Foals.

Though\nunassuming both in the\nrecording studio and out,\nshe\u2019s managed to feature\ntwice on the list of the top\nten best-selling albums of\nthe noughties and wrack\nup four BRITAwards. Her\nfirst two albums No Angel\nand Life for Rent topped\nthe UK year-end charts\nin 2001 and 2003, and the\ntwo albums since, Safe\nTrip Home and Girl Who\nGot Away, were moderate\ncommercial successes\ndespite not reaching the\nheights of her early career.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that she\u2019s\nearned a spot amongst\nthe greatest British solo\nartists, but it\u2019s been\nsix years since her last\nalbum\u2013 does she still have\nthe hit-making chops, or\nhas the tea gone cold on\nDido\u2019s musical career?\nStill on My Mind,\nreleased last Friday,\ndoesn\u2019t deviate significantly from the Dido\nformula of signature\nwispy vocals on soft\nacoustic instrumentals\nthat has served her so\nwell. In fact, many of the\ntracks wouldn\u2019t be out of\nplace in her debut album\nNo Angel. Both place\ngreater emphasis on the\ninstrumentals, opting for\nparticularly percussion\nheavy numbers and\nextended breaks within\nsongs. Thematically,\nhowever, the two records\nare very different. No\nAngel, first released when\nDido was still in her 20s,\nhas a focus on the highs\nand lows of a relationship\nand accepting that she\nisn\u2019t perfect, with a few\nslides into narratives of\nlow points in her life\nand recognising the lack\nof permanence in these.\nComing two years later,\nLife for Rent also has\nmany titles about relation-ships, but Dido begins to\nexplore different themes.\nParticularly in the titular\ntrack \u2018Life for Rent\u2019, we\nsee a more retrospective\nand contemplative side to\nDido as she croons \u201cBut if\nmy life is for rent / and I\ndon\u2019t learn to buy / Well I\ndeserve nothing more than\nI get \u2018cause nothing I have\nis truly mine\u201d. This side\nbecomes more and more\nprominent as time goes\non; third album Safe Trip\nHome focussing heavily\non Dido\u2019s loss of her\nfather, while fourth album\nGirl Who Got Away deals\nwith her almost gleeful\nacceptance that she\u2019s not\n\u201cFollowing\nfour albums of\nrelationship\ntumult, it\nseems from\nthis track\nthat Dido has\nfinally found\nsome stability\u201d\nquite \u201csitting on the roof\nof the world\u201d anymore.\nThis trend continues to\nStill on My Mind. Opening\ntrack \u2018Hurricanes\u2019 is\nharrowing, yet oddly\nuplifting; lyrics \u201cLet me\nface the sound and fury /\nLet me face hurricanes\u201d\nare fitting as the song\nprogresses with various\ninstruments being added\nin succession to a cacophonous climax followed by\nsilence. Following four\nalbums of relationship\ntumult, it seems from this\ntrack that Dido has finally\nfound some stability in\nher relationship and is\nready to face hurricanes\nwith her husband. It\u2019s\nalmost a completion of a\nfive-album story arc, and\nmany of the later songs\nseem to be reflections on\nlife experiences rather\nthan of how she currently\nfeels.\nThe lead single \u2018Give\nYou Up\u2019 perhaps strays\nfurthest away from what\nwe traditionally expect\nfrom Dido. It\u2019s one of\nthe few Dido songs with\na piano led composition,\nand features backing\nvocals that put you in\nmind of Hawaiian folk\nmusic. With as much\nserenity and delicacy as\nwith all her lyrics, Dido\ntalks of breaking away\nfrom an unhealthy relationship and accepting the\nconsequences \u2013 \u201cI found\na way to let you go / It\u2019s\ngonna rip your heart out\u201d.\nThough maybe not quite\nthe relentless earworm\nof previous singles like\n\u2018White Flag\u2019 and \u2018Thank\nYou\u2019, \u2018Give You Up\u2019 still\ngets you humming for\nhours after.\nMore upbeat mid-re-cord tracks \u2018Hell After\nThis\u2019 and \u2018Take You\nHome\u2019 both deal with\npositive experiences in\nrelationships in a light\nsense. While far from\nbeing dancefloor fillers,\nthey\u2019re needed breaks\nfrom slower, more sombre\ntracks. The final few\ntracks are very familiar\nDido. Each of her albums\nfeature one sassy, musical\nversion of a subtweet\nsong and this manifests\nin \u2018Friends\u2019 which is a\nvery enjoyable, easy-on-the-ears pop ditty. Dido\ncloses the album with\n\u2018Have to Stay\u2019, a poignant\node to motherhood that\nmost directly reflects\nher current stage in life.\nThe instrumental is very\ngentle, allowing Dido\u2019s\nvoice (her greatest asset)\nto connect to the listener.\n\u201cI\u2019m here as long as you\nneed / When you show\nyou\u2019re / Okay on your\nown / I\u2019ll smile and leave\u201d\nperfectly encapsulates the\nfeel of the song, and the\ngeneral theme of content\nin the permanence of\nmotherhood.\nStill on My Mind was a\npersonal project for Dido\n\u2013 much of it was recorded\nat the home of her brother\nand long-term co-produc-er Rollo, and produced\nby the two of them. The\nproduction quality, none-theless, is one of the best\nfrom her albums so far.\nThe album holds up well\nto all releases across her\n20-year career and was\nworth the wait. Confident\nserenity permeates every\nsong, and Dido\u2019s delicate\nvocals are showcased as\nalways. How long will\nit be until Dido\u2019s next\nrelease? Who knows,\nreally. She\u2019s quite upfront\nabout not feeling any\npressure to create music\nand is driven by a love of\ncreating music with her\nbrother. But this album\nshows that Dido can still\nproduce quality records\nand achieve success in\nthe current market (it\u2019s\ntoo early to give a chart\nposition, but Still on\nMy Mind was 3rd in the\nmid-week update). She\u2019s\ngoing on tour for the first\ntime in 15 years this year,\nand I\u2019m looking forward\nto what comes next for\nDido, even if it\u2019s another\ndecade until we get some\nnew music.\nMUSIC\nShervin Sabeghi\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Dido.

    "content": "ISSUE 1718\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nSmash Corner - Lucas: basically Ness 2.0\nGAMES\nMichael Cognet\nGames Writer\nH\nave you been\nwaiting on the\nedge of your\nseat for us to\nfinally write a Smash\nCorner article on one of\nthe many famous Fire\nEmblem playable fighters\nin Ultimate? Well, you\ncan put your swords back\nin their sheath because\nwe are going, once again,\nto that obscure franchise\nEarthBound with character #37 of the roster,\nLucas.\nThat\u2019s right, the\nfranchise also known as\nMother has not only one\nbut two fighters representing it, even though\nprobably none of us have\nactually played it. Lucas\nappeared as the protagonist of the third instalment\nof the series, making his\nentrance to the Smash\nroster in Brawl, and has\nnow been in every game\never since, despite the fact\nthat they tried to get rid of\nhim in the Wii U version.\nHe persisted as a very\nlight, floaty and mobile\ncharacter with PSI attacks\nto dominate his opponents\nwithin a medium to long\nrange.\nThe heart of Lucas\u2019s\nmove set is his special, of\nwhich the most important\none being his neutral, PK\nFreeze. It is a slow long-ranged projectile that\nfreezes your enemy for a\nshort duration, launching\nthem off the edge of the\nscreen defenceless. Then\ncomes his side-special\nPK Fire, a medium-range\nlinear projectile which\nexplodes and knocks back\nenemies. Lucas\u2019s down-B\nis his PSI Magnet, a\ngreat defensive tool that\nwill absorb any of your\nopponent\u2019s energy-based\nprojectile to heal himself.\nAnd finally, his up-special\nis his PK Thunder, a\nhighly dirigible tool which\ncan be used as both a long\nrange attack or a recovery\nif you hit yourself with it.\nThe hardest part of\nplaying Lucas is mastering these specials. Firstly,\nhe has one of the weirdest\nrecoveries of the game,\nbut once you master your\nPK Thunder recovery, you\ncan also launch yourself\nat your opponent with it\nto obtain a devastating\nmeteor smash. Then his\nPK Freeze is also hard to\nuse, but once you manage\nto steer it and anticipate\nyour enemy\u2019s movements,\nyou have one of the best\nedge guarding tools that\ncan obtain a kill from the\ncomfort and safety of the\nstage. And even though\nit is not that complicated,\nyou will probably end up\nspamming PK Fire as it is\na great tool to simultaneously dish out the damage\nand keep the opponents\naway.\nLucas\u2019s normal tilt\nand smash attacks do\nstill fit very well with his\nplaystyle, as most of them\nhave a big knockback\nto keep opponents away\nif they come too close.\nTake the knockback to\nthe extreme and you have\na great killing tool; the\nprime example being his\nup-smash an attack with\na huge hitbox that will\nfinish anybody higher\nthan 80%. However, you\nwill easily be punished\nif you miss it is slow and\nhave a lot of lag time. If\nyou want a safer option to\nend a stock, Lucas has a\nvery good tether grab to\ncatch your opponent even\nat range and follow it up\nwith his forward, back or\nup kill-throw.\nAll in all, Lucas has a\nlot going for him, with his\nhigh mobility, powerful\nspecials, his killing\nthrows. This takes him up\nto a solid high tier, not too\nfar behind his Earthbound\nbuddy. But I personally\nprefer to play Lucas since\nhe relies more on his\nspecials than Ness, so I\nsuggest you try him out\nfor once instead of the\nusual basic-boy.\nIs it a bird, is it a plane, no it\u2019s ... a clone of Ness that has been around for way too long. Presenting Lucas the\ncharacter from that obscure series that not many people played!\nThis isn\u2019t an edited image or anything, the marketing team legitimately decided to have that as his tagline // Nintendo\n\n"

Throw in\na little fantasy, a little science fiction, and you have\nthe steampunk movement\n\u2013 a weirdly intriguing\ncombination of Victorian\naesthetics and industrial\nsteam-powered machin-ery. That\u2019s the world that\nartist Gary Nicholls is\nexploring in his ambitious\ntrilogy The Imaginarium,\na staged \u2018photojournalistic\u2019 series that offers us a\nglimpse into the fictional\nlife of Eva, a heroine and\nadventuress from the fan-tastical steampunk world\nof Nicholls\u2019 imagination.\nEach photo is a composite\nof multiple, sometimes\nhundreds, of images, with\nthe finished look seam-lessly stitched together\nin Photoshop. I had the\npleasure of speaking to\nNicholls at the Talented\nArt Fair this March to find\nout more about his work:\nWhy have you chosen\nto photograph\nthe models and\nthe background\nseparately, rather\nthan the whole scene\nat the same time?\nMostly because they\ncouldn\u2019t all make the\nshoot at once. I rely on\npeople who make time\nfor the shoot - I don\u2019t pay\nanybody for this because\nthey want to do it, they\nwant to be part of it. And\nit\u2019s consistent because all\nof those people in all of\nthe images are acting - I\ntell them what to do, and\nthey take on the character.\nTell me more about\nthe backgrounds.\nI\u2019ve taken 8 and a half\nthousand pictures just to\nget the hundred and fifty\nthat are in this book. It\u2019s\nnot just about picking\nthe best image, it\u2019s also\nbecause of the places I go\nto. (Points at photo) That\nplace doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s\nmade of all the different\nplaces I\u2019ve been to and\nphotographed. I take\nelements from each one\nand put them all together.\nDo you ever\nphotograph your\nsubjects in the\nlandscape?\nNo, always separately.\nThat way I can control\nthe light. I studied the\nway that Caravaggio\nand Vermeer used paintbrushes to create light. If\nyou look at any of their\nworks, the background\u2019s\nnot out of focus as it\nwould be with a camera,\nit\u2019s detailed. All my\nbackgrounds are detailed.\nThe only reason why you\nlook where I want you to\nlook is because of the way\nthey\u2019re lit.\nThat\u2019s very interesting.\nSo it would actually\nbe more detailed than\nyou were taking a\nphoto from the front,\nwith a camera.\nYes. I\u2019m known for my\ndetail. And again, these\nprints are printed on metal\n- it\u2019s called Chromelux.\nThe light goes through the\nimage and gets reflected\nback, making the images\nlook like they\u2019re backlit.\nAnd why steampunk?\nI was looking for a\ntheme, for just six pictures\ninitially. I actually read an\nmagazine article about\nhow to create a steampunk\nimage in Photoshop, and\nI thought: People must\ndo this for real. Googled\nit, found the Lincoln\nSteampunk Festival (now\nthe biggest in the world)\nand went there in 2012\nand met loads of people.\nWe created some images\ntogether and I thought,\nthis is bigger than just 6\nimages, maybe I\u2019ll just\nexpand it into a little short\nstory. And now it\u2019s ended\nup as a 450 image trilogy!\nWow, that\u2019s amazing.\nThere will be a film\nor a TV series at the end\nof it too. It\u2019s been mad.\nReally, it\u2019s about using\nyour imagination to create\nsomething that captures\nsomeone else\u2019s imagina-tion. Not everybody will\nlike this, that\u2019s for sure,\nbut if it makes them stop\nand think, then - at least\nit\u2019s got a reaction. It\u2019s also\nabout all the people that I\nmeet.\nYour models, are\nthey people from the\nsteampunk scene?\nYes. So every person\nin my story is a genuine\nsteampunk, that\u2019s my rule.\nCan\u2019t be in it if you\u2019re not.\nYou have to be a steampunk because if you are,\nyou get it. You understand\nwhat I\u2019m trying to do, and\ntherefore when you\u2019re\nacting, you take on that\ncharacter.\nAnd do you feel\nthat you\u2019ve joined\nthe steampunk\ncommunity yourself?\nOh yes. Absolutely! I\nwasn\u2019t, but amazingly, the\nPhotoshop magazine that I\nfirst read about steampunk\nin - they just did a feature\non me and my work. So\nit\u2019s sort of gone full circle.\nAmazing. And after\nthe trilogy is over, will\nyou still continue with\nsteampunk?\nYes. My next project is\ngoing to be a steampunk\npost-apocalyptic story.\nAnd even before that, in\nmy final book, I\u2019m going\naround the world to photograph 4000 steampunks\nfrom different countries,\nand combine them into a\nhuge Lord of the Rings\nstyle battle scene.\nWhat a massive\nproject.\nYes. I\u2019m completely\nmad. It is good though,\nI really enjoy it. It\u2019s just\nthat my art takes a long\ntime to produce because\nso much time goes into\neach image.\nAny final thoughts?\nIf you have something\ninside you that you really\nwant to do, whether it\u2019s\nto write a book, paint a\npicture, compose music\n\u2013 whatever it is, be a bit\nselfish about it and go and\ndo it. Because time passes\nby too quick. Be selfish\nwith yourself and go and\ndo it. It\u2019s never too late.\nIf you\u2019re interested,\nGary Nicholls\u2019 work can\nbe found at g-n-p.co.uk, or\non Facebook at @GaryN-ichollsPhotography.\n\u2018Samandiriel\u2019 // Gary Nicholls\nISSUE 1718\nFELIX\n24\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSomeone\u2019s watching: Nicholls\u2019work at Shoreditch station // Gary Nicholls\n\n"

Of the most\nwidely shared health articles published in 2018,\nless than 50% were rated\nhighly credible and of the\ntop 10 shared articles, 7\ncontained misleading or\nfalse information.\nDespite no evidence\nto suggest that the MMR\nvaccination causes\nautism, vaccination rates\nhave fallen in England\nfor the fourth year in\na row.

The onset of Brexit,\nas we rapidly approach\nthe 29th of March, has\nthrown my whole identity\ninto crisis. My British\ncitizenship, which I have\nproudly possessed for my\nwhole life up to this point,\nnow threatens the other\npillars on which I base\nmyself.\nI was born in Nottingham. My parents met\nat university due to an\nErasmus programme but,\nafter a few lovely years in\nthe UK, they took job opportunities in Geneva. We\nenjoyed a nice life, living\nin neighbouring France,\nhopping across the border\nevery day for school\nand work. For many, the\nadvantages of the EU\nmight be a little abstract;\nI reaped the fruits of this\nunion everyday as my life\nwas sprawled across it.\nWith nothing but a British\npassport to my name, I\nstill felt like I belonged in\nthis little corner of France.\nI may have possessed a\nBritish passport, and the\nlady next door a French\none, but we were both\nEuropean equals. This\ncommon identity was\ncomforting as beyond\nhaving the right to live\nhere in France, I genuinely\nfelt like I belonged. Nonetheless, after spending\nall my formative years\nlearning the language and\nculture, I still felt British\nand not French.\nI have no familial ties\nto the UK. My allegiance\nto this nation was due to\nthe values of tolerance and\nopenness that it stood for.\nThese values had allowed\nmy immigrant parents to\nstudy and work, providing\nthem with a springboard\ninto a successful life.\nWhen Brexit happened\non the 23rd of June, I\nwas in shock as nothing\nwould be the same again.\nTo think that my entire\nexistence could be ripped\nup, with my precious\npassport becoming blue\nas my country was turning\nits back on my beloved\nEU. Those leading the\ndebate see this as a purely\npolitical decision but for\nmillions of young citizens,\nthe European identity is in\ntheir blood.\nUltimately, I believe\nsome aspects of Brexit\nhave been exaggerated. I\nam sure my rights at home\nin France and the rights of\n1.3 million British citizens\nliving in the EU will be\nguaranteed. There might\nbe a small recession and\nthen business as usual.\nHowever, things will\nnever be the same again\nas the message sent by\nBrexit resonates in every\ncorner of the globe.\nBritain has always been\nan extremely multicultural nation where all could\nfeel welcome. This might\nnot change overnight, but\nleading up to the vote on\nthe 23rd of June 2016,\nup until Brexit day on\nthe 29th of March and\nbeyond these ideals have\nbeen and are continuing\nto be eroded. This whole\nordeal has unleashed the\nbeast of xenophobia and\ntoxic nationalism and\nnormalized it for many.\nIncreasingly being tarnished by these cancerous\nvoices, it is natural that\ninternational talent will\nlook elsewhere for oppor-tunities. Students, who\ncame to Britain on a wave\nof internationalism, like\nmy own parents, would\nnever dare under today\u2019s\nconditions. This prospect\nhorrifies me and so I no\nlonger wear the badge of\nBritishness with pride, if\nI could, I would no longer\nwear it at all.\nImperial pays working student late, again\nF\nor the third time\nin six months,\nImperial departments have failed\nto pay students who work\nfor them on a part time\nbasis on time. Students\nworking on all day workshops around the pay date\nwere informally told that\nthey may have not be\npaid on time, and that it\nCOMMENT\nAnonymous\nComment Writer\nwas their responsibility\nto follow it up with upper\nmanagement. Imperial\nOutreach, the department\nresponsible for science\ncommunication and\noutreach programs, was\nlargely affected, but have\nyet to put out any official\ninformation informing\nstudents they may yet to\nbe paid and what to do\nabout it.\nThis comes at a bad\ntime for the Outreach\ndepartment, whom have\nbeen struggling to recruit\nmore students to work\nin the new Outreach\nspace on the new White\nCity Campus. Students\nworking for Outreach,\nknown as casual-pay\nworkers, often rely on\ntheir wages to pay bills\nand rent. One student,\nwho was owed over\n\u00a3300 for work in January\nand February, told Felix\nthat they had to rely on\ntheir life savings to get\nby that month. Students\nwere also payed late just\nbefore Christmas, and in\nOctober.\nImperial Outreach\ndepartments run summer\nschools for London secondary school students.\nIt relies on about 100\nImperial students each\nsummer. Both students\nand staff were paid late\nand the wrong amounts\nin October, for work conducted over the 3 summer\nmonths. Some individuals were missing over\n\u00a31,000, causing stress and\nfinancial problems. With\nrent and bills increasing\nfaster than student loans\nin London, it is unacceptable for Imperial to pay\nstudents and staff late.\nPls pay me in real money // Flickr\n\n"

All the guests are\nhighly accomplished\nand inspiring women\nin STEM, deliberately\nkept anonymous with\ndisguised voices. This\nallows them to enjoy the\nfreedom to speak openly\nand honestly about their\npersonal journeys, and\nminimises how others\ncould judge them by their\nacademic achievements,\nwhat they look like and/\nor any other \u2018societal\u2019\nlabels and badges. Felix\nsat down with the host\nof Sci{l}ence, Dr. Shini\nSomara.\nCould you describe to\nme how the podcast\ncame to being. Firstly,\nhow long have you\nbeen doing it?\nLast weekend I released\nepisode 36. It came about\nreally because I studied\nMechanical Engineering\n[at Brunel] myself and\nthere were very few\nwomen on my course.\nAs a result of being at\nuniversity for almost\neight years because I did\nmy bachelors and then I\nwent on to do a doctorate,\nI spent pretty much eight\nyears never really talking\nabout my experiences\nin studying engineering.\nWhen I got into televi-sion, I was conducting\nreports on a really diverse\nrange of science and tech\nand innovation stories.\nOften, when the cameras\nwould be turned off and\nthey were just being their\nnatural selves, we would\nhave really insightful\nconversations about what\nit\u2019s like being a woman in\nSTEM. It really gave me\nan insight into their world\nas human beings rather\nthan scientists. It got me\nthinking about how to\nbring out this kind of truth\nwithout compromising on\ntheir identities and their\nreputations, and that\u2019s\nhow the podcast format\ncame about and then the\nname just popped into\nmy head out of nowhere.\nThere\u2019s so much power in\nsilence\nWhat are the biggest\nchallenges that you\u2019ve\nfaced in doing the\npodcast?\nThe biggest challenges\nhave been finding women\nwho are willing to get\ninvolved because anonymity is something that\nwe really are not familiar\nwith in this day and age.\nThe ability to truly trust\nanonymity on the podcast\nmakes women hesitate to\ncome on\nGoing forward, what\ndo you see as the\nfuture of the podcast?\nI\u2019m hoping that it will\nbe a place where it will\ninspire others. I\u2019m hoping\nthat the podcast will be a\nplace where people can\njustgetabitoftheabilityto\nrelate. I think also I would\nlike to change attitudes.\nI actually would prefer it\nif more men listened to\nthe podcast than women\nbecause I think what\u2019s difficult for women in STEM\nis male attitudes towards\nthem being in STEM. I\u2019d\nlove to have some kind of\nimpact, even if it\u2019s a small\ndent, on our perception\nof stereotypes, cultural\nand traditional values and\nbeliefs towards women\nin STEM. I\u2019d just like to\nmake a bit of a difference\nin uniting men and women\nin STEM because I think\nthere\u2019s such a divide.\nDo you think it\u2019s\npossible to affect\nmeaningful change\nwith regards to\nattitudes towards\nwomen in STEM if\nmen continue to\nnot engage with the\nmovement?\nIt\u2019s a really tricky\nquestion because, on the\none hand, a lot energy is\nbeing put into encouraging women. In order to do\nthat, I\u2019ve seen that they\nexclude men, just so that\nthey\u2019ve got a safe space.\nWe need to change the way\nwe\u2019re raising our men.\nFrom young, we need to\ndevelop a respect for what\nwomen can bring to the\ntable. A massive change\nis required. When we do\ninclude them, we should\nlet women take the stage\nand not be overshadowed\nby what men can bring.\nEither through the\npodcast or through\npersonal experience,\nwhat would you say\nare the biggest issues\nthat are faced by\nwomen in STEM?\nI think the biggest\nissues are self belief.\nI think another one is\nfighting the discrimination\nand how much energy that\ntakes; women getting to a\npoint where they\u2019re like,\n\u201cWhy am I bothering?\nI\u2019m already in something\nso hard and then I\u2019ve got\nto prove myself extra hard\nbecause I\u2019m a woman\u201d.\nThere are so many issues\nbecause there are so few\nof us and that can be additional pressure. There\u2019s\na lot of challenges that\nwe face and it\u2019s actually\nreally admirable how\nmuch we take on board as\nwomen in STEM. Of the\nwomen that I have spoken\nto, they just absolutely\nlove their job and so you\ncan see that satisfaction is\nwhat keeps them going.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m up\nto at the moment!\nH\ney guys! I am Laura Chen, the 18-19 International Officer. My role\nis to represent the international\nstudent body and to advocate for\ncultural diversity at Imperial College.\nImperial is a truly global community with\n64% of its students being non-UK students\nand from all over the world.

In\ntruth if you think about the\nconcept of a day to celebrate women, it sounds\nalmost absurd, women are\nso crucial to humankind\nthat a one-day celebration\ndoesn\u2019t even come close\nto acknowledging how\nimportant women are.\nThat\u2019s one way of seeing\nit, and there\u2019s also the\nviewpoint that argues that\nwomen are very well off\nin the present day and\nage, and that feminism is\nunnecessary, and that an\nInternational Women\u2019s\nDay is pointless.\nSo, what is Women\u2019s\nDay in any case? Do\nwomen just gather\ntogether and have\nsleepovers and watch rom\ncoms? No, wrong, that\u2019s\nValentine\u2019s Day. The 8th\nMarch is the day that\nacross the world women\nand men gather to bring\nattention to women\u2019s\nrights, and campaign for\nequality. For us as privileged first world citizens,\nit may seem strange. What\nmore battles are there\nleft to fight for women\u2019s\nequality? We\u2019ve seen\nit all now, from female\nsuffrage, to female pres-idents, CEO\u2019s and scien-tists. In fact, if feminism\nhas now boiled down to\nif my nipple is censored\nor not on Instagram,\nthen that either says that\nindeed feminism has lost\nits purpose, or that there\u2019s\nnothing more left to fight\nfor.\nBut I believe that there\nis much more left to do.\nI disagree that the main\nstruggle for women now\nis deciding how little\nclothes we get to wear,\nand I have noticed that\nthe women that are most\npassionate about this topic\nare famous women whose\nmain source of income\nrelies on their body and\nappearance. As such,\nI wondered if perhaps\nthere\u2019s a deeper meaning\nto their protest that may\nhave gone unnoticed.\nThe common underlying\ntheme seems to be a rejection of the established\npatriarchy\u2019s standards of\nwhat women should do\nwith themselves and their\nbodies? That is certainly\nsomething I agree with. I\nhave had the privilege of\ngrowing up in a country\nwhere deciding what I\nwanted to study was not\nan outrage, and where\nbeing a less agreeable,\nquiet and polite woman\nwas not a catastrophe.\nNonetheless, I have not\nentirely escaped the daily\njabs that are part of being\na woman.\nIt is here in Imperial\nwhere I have had my\nabilities questioned the\nmost. It is mostly by male\ncounterparts that seemed\nto think that they are\nentitled to interrogate me\nwith an air of examination\nto find out if I \u201cactually\nknow what I\u2019m talking\nabout\u201d. How am I meant\nto react to their patronising response when they\nrealise I do indeed know\nwhat I\u2019m doing? Am I\nmeant to be thankful,\ndespite the fact that they\njust insinuated that they\ndidn\u2019t believe I was smart\nenough to be their equal?\nOther examples include\nbeing told to go ask\nanother (male) friend for\nhelp, for the lack of belief\nthat I am capable enough\nof doing my own projects.\nEven the eyebrow raises\nof surprise when other\n(again male) individuals\nare shocked that I\u2019m\nworking on something\n\u201ccool\u201d or \u201cdifficult\u201d. As\nthough it is a surprise that\nI could work on anything\nmildly challenging.\nAnother serious issue\nthat a worryingly high\nproportion of men in\nImperial have is the inability to speak to females\nunless the motivation\nis romantic. However, I\nmust say out of respect\nto many other men that I\nknow, that it is unfair to\nclaim that all of them are\nthe same, because that\u2019s\nnot factually correct and I\npersonally despise gener-alisations.\nThese are just some inconveniences faced in the\ndaily life of many women\nin similar situations to\nmine, and whilst these are\nnot life changing and most\nof us have developed the\nsubtle art of not giving\na fuck, it becomes more\nworrying when you encounter situations in your\nlife where you fear for\nyour safety. Whether it be\nbeing followed in a car by\nstrange looking men, to\nrepeated unwanted sexual\nadvances, almost every\nanything in between. Take\nthis time to reflect on how\nyou can contribute to a\nmore equal world. It\u2019s in\nfact very simple. Be re-spectful, treat the women\nand men around you as\nequal. If you are woman,\nthen question yourself,\nare you doing something\nfor yourself or to adhere\nto a standard that was set\nby a patriarchal system?\nIf you are a man, question\nyourself too. Are you\ndoing something for\nyourself, or to prove your\nmasculinity? Sometimes\nit is hard to tell the differ-ence.\nSo back to my initial\nquestion. Why DO we\nneed Women\u2019s Day? The\nanswer is we don\u2019t. The\nconcept of having one\nday a year to remind us\nto be respectful towards\nall genders and to ensure\nthat all genders are equal\nis dumb, because we\nshouldn\u2019t need this day\nat all. The fact that we\nhave this is a clear sign\nthat we still have things\nto change. As a feminist,\nI will be happy when the\nday comes when having\nwomen\u2019s day is absurd\nbecause women and men\nare indeed equal.\nUntil then, I will\ncelebrate what I consider\nfeminist icons. Independent working women,\nsingle mums raising\nfamilies, mothers that\nteach their sons respect\nand not their daughters\nto not go out at night\nalone, fathers that call\ntheir daughters intelligent\nas opposed to beautiful\nand all the women that\nare silent revolutionaries,\nbreaking sexist rules one\nat a time. And maybe one\nday I\u2019ll be less annoyed\nabout the free the nipple\nhashtag being used as a\nfeminist slogan, although\nthe latter is very unlikely.\nWomen protesting in Madrid on the 8th March/ / Telemadrid\nwoman you speak to will\nhave some anecdote of\nunfortunate happenings\nlike the ones previously\nmentioned that they could\ntell you about. Were I\nto describe the ones that\nhave occurred to me and\nto women I am close with,\nthis article would be a) too\nlong and b) too graphic to\npublish. But please, if you\nare a man reading this,\ntake 5 minutes of your day\nand ask a female friend if\nshe would like to tell you\nabout any similar experiences she might have\nhad. You\u2019ll be surprised,\nbecause the likelihood\nis that anyone from your\nsister to your mother will\nhave experienced something very similar.\nBut the purpose of\nthis article is not to rant\nabout the sexism I face\nin my daily life because\nthe world doesn\u2019t revolve\naround me. The purpose\nis for you, the reader,\nto realise that you can\ndo something to change\nthis. It doesn\u2019t matter if\nyou\u2019re a woman, man or\n\n"
