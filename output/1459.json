There was no Mark Fast! What\na con!\nThen a helpful shop assistant came\nto my rescue. It turned out that Mark\nFast\u2019s garments have just arrived earlier that morning, and they remained\nin the back, unboxed.\nI described my dream skirt. Miraculously, the man agreed to go to the back\nand do a quick ransack for me!\nAlthough the skirt was non-existent,\na dress variation was available for pur-chase. I gingerly took the dress in my\narms, petting it. My imagination had\nperfected the dress in so many dimen-sions... I was looking for a silky and\nsoft texture. The reality was more of\na rough, strawy sensation. I was still\nelectrified, nonetheless.\nThe size 0 phenomenon hit home\nin the fitting room. I can barely fit my\nthighs into the dress. The dress was so\ntiny that I wonder how many women\nin real life can manoeuvre into it with\nease and grace?\nThe Erdem rail was disappointing\ntoo. But I was assured by the staff that\nthe designers send in new stock every\nweek, that I should keep coming back.\nShame I live about 100 miles away.\nAs I left the shop disappointed, the\ncredit card breathed a sigh of relief. It\nhas survived another battle.\nRid of the stress pimples\nN\no one likes facial indi-cators, especially when\nthey are stress induced\nand flare in a raffish\ncrimson colour plus the\nformidable pus.\nMany assail these unsightly spots\nwith an antediluvian regime \u2013 anti-blemish face wash, scrubs, benzoyl\nperoxide creams, toothpaste...\nI have experienced the cherry blossom before and I know that having\nacne can feel like a debilitating dis-ease.

So I\u2019m going to do\nwhat I always do when I\u2019m hungover and discover something\npeople dislike: I\u2019m going to go on about\nit even more.\nFirstly, let me declare my intent. I\ndon\u2019t think any one of the parties are\nparticularly amazing; yes, I hate David\nCameron as much as the next person,\nand the day I vote for him will be the\nday I get to sleep with Katy Perry. Actually, if you\u2019re listening Dave- set it up\nand my vote is yours (apparently saying I would \u201ccut off my left bollock to\nsleep with you\u201d just doesn\u2019t seem to cut\nit with the ladies any more). Now that\nwould be a fair future for everyone.\nBut I digress. Aside from the obvious points that everyone always moans\nabout with elections (such as \u201call politicians are wankers\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t know\nI actually had to register to vote\u201d) my\nmain problem is with these infernal debates that are on at the moment. I was\ngenuinely surprised that the blasted\nthings even went ahead; all three of\nthe main parties managed to resist the\ncries for so long, and then having realised that people weren\u2019t looking for an\nelection so much as they were looking\nfor Obama-esque election sexytimes\nrather than dependable democracy,\nthey caved in.\nSo what is my problem? The debates\njust don\u2019t work. In the UK we follow a\n\u201cfirst past the post\u201d voting system. In\nthe States, televised debates work a little better because the voters do (albeit\nin a slightly convoluted way) vote for a\nPresident rather than a party, and it\u2019s\nthe votes for that politician that gets\nthem elected as the President. Contrast that to here, where it\u2019s the leader\nof the party with the most votes who\nbecomes the de facto Prime Minister.\nWhilst an election will always have\nsome focus on the party leaders, the\nimportance of policies and local candidates I fear has been lost. When we\ncombine this with our tri-partisan\nsystem compared this to the USA\u2019s\npredominantly bi-partisan structure,\nwe\u2019re in big trouble. Because the winning party is decided by simple majority rather than an absolute number, a\nparty who technically wins still might\nnot have enough power to pass legislation without help from across the floor.\nSo what we end up with is a debate encouraging us to vote for the personalities and flair of a man, given we all have\na natural preference for certain styles\nof speaking and none of them are so\ndifferent or mad to be sufficiently\npolarising, the debates have just compounded this lack of a decisive vote.\nI\u2019m not saying this would be any better\nunder a Proportional Representation\nsystem, but at least we\u2019d know what\nwe\u2019re signing up for.\nSo, instead we now have a giant personality contest, but with none of the\npersonality, contest, or giants.\nEven if this wasn\u2019t true, the debates\nare so painfully boring, rehearsed and\ndowdy that they become politically\nirrelevant. Cameron, without fail (or\nindeed any sense of irony whatsoever)\ncracks out these incredulous anecdotes where he met an [insert ethnic-ity, gender and occupation] at a [insert\nlocation] who told him that [insert key\nvoting issue] was very important to [in-sert key demographic], whilst Brown is\npositively falling over himself to fallate\nClegg- who in turn is more interested\nin fallating himself for trying to do\nwhat everyone else wants to do now a\nfew months before. In the two debates\nI have watched at the time of writing,\nI struggled to find a single concise, ingenuous policy; seeing as we\u2019re voting\nfor a party and not a person it might\nbe considerate of their dear leaders to\nactually tell us what those policies are.\nMeanwhile, all three of them squabble over who said what and when to a\npoint where it is no longer funny but\ntiresome; if I wanted to see three middle aged, balding men almost come to\nblows over economic policy I\u2019d go to\na Soho brothel and watch the punters\ndiscuss who was going to pay for the\norgy. Perhaps that\u2019s just me. A mute,\nand by appearance clinically depressed\naudience reading questions from cards\nlike they\u2019re on day release into the\ncommunity really doesn\u2019t inflame the\npassion for democracy either.\nPerhaps the most dangerous prob-lem, however, is that now we have an\nelection that has lost its focus. It makes\nsense on paper to have these televised\ndebates in order to reduce voter apa-thy, and I concede that despite this\nbeing one of the less polarising elections in history it does appear that it\nmay well have one of the biggest voter\nturnouts for a fair while. For a reason\nI can\u2019t fathom people seem to be inexplicably tired of Brown, and Cameron\ncomes across as very sleazy; both of\nthem have come across as old school\npoliticians in these debates and certainly haven\u2019t come out of the whole\nthing very well. The Liberal Democrats, seemingly buoyed by the power\nthey hold over the major two parties,\nappear a real alternative, with a worrying lack of perspective on the real\nworld. Despite that, I\u2019ll be voting LibDem because my MP is pretty good\n(and not Tory). I\u2019m more Labour, if I\u2019m\nhonest, but let\u2019s not start on Tactical\nvoting\u2026\nIt is a worrying precedent; if we carry\non like this I can easily imagine that\nwe\u2019ll end up in an American system\nanyway (brought to you courtesy of\nPepsi and McDonalds). My prediction\nthis time round is a hung parliament-and the only way any of you can stop\nit is by ignoring these fruitless debates\nand reading up on the policies of the\nparties and your local candidate. If I\u2019m\ncompletely honest, however, I\u2019m holding out for a \u201cTotal Wipeout\u201d version\nof the debates hosted by Richard Hammond, with me sitting in my pants on\na Saturday evening eating Doritos as\nDavid Cameron is catapulted from a\ngiant red balloon in the middle of Argentina. Now that\u2019s voting for change.\nJaimieHenryontelevisedelectiondebates\n\u201cIf I wanted to see\nthree middle aged,\nmen coming to\nblows... I\u2019d go to a\nSoho brothel.\u201d\nW\ne all know that there\nis a general election\nin Britain, on the 6th\nof May.(if you didn\u2019t\nknow that, you know\nit now) And, I\u2019m another of those floating voters. According to the London\nEvening Standard, more than 40% of\nstudents in London universities are like\nme (as of last week), still not sure whom\nto vote for.\nI asked my Dad whom he thinks I\nshould vote for, and he told me to \u201cvote\nthe party which will devalue the pound,\nso that I will have to spend fewer rupees\nfor your studies\u201d\n. What selfless advice, I\nthought sarcastically.\nNow, I asked his cousin who lives here\nin Britain, and she said she\u2019ll vote conservatives because apparently Maggie\nThatcher had increased her salary by\nmany pounds, many decades ago. Fair\nenough.\nI then asked my dad\u2019s friend, who said\nhe\u2019ll vote Labour. Reason-\u201dWe\u2019ve always\nvoted Labour\u201d\n, he said. Which means\nthere is no reason. I asked my room\nmate and once again \u201cLabour\u201d\n. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n,\nI asked. \u201cMy uncle is a Labour Councillor\u201d\n. I asked at least five more friends,\nand all their reasons were extremely\npersonal, that is if they even had any\nreason to vote for a party.\nSince no party appeals to me per-sonally, I have decided to vote for\na party based on its policies, for\nthe benefit of all. After all, its my\nfirst vote in any election (general\nor council or whatever) and I am\nnot gonna \u201cwaste\u201d it. I arranged my\npreference in the order Con, Lib\nDems and Lab, Conservatives being\nthe most preferred and Labour being the least (I think because of Gordon Brown).\nIn this backdrop came the much anticipated first ever Prime-ministerial\ndebate on ITV. Less interesting than\nthe American debates, but, believe it or\nnot, it has had the biggest effect on my\nopinion about the main British parties\nand their leaders. Cameron simply did\nnot rise to my expectations; he sucked.\nBrown was less grumpy, but still boring\n(better than what I expected from him).\nThe star was of course Nick Clegg - that\ndude is a professional. He knew what to\nsay, and was very calm even when he\ncriticised the other two parties. At the\nend of 94 minutes, there was a huge shift\nin my political preference. Nick is now\nfirst, Brown next and Cameron needs to\nbe kept in the opposition.\nBut, wait a second, there is one more\ndebate left and my opinion is not yet\nsealed, it is always open for modification\n(if needed).\nNow, I wonder if debates are going to\nbe the most decisive factor in this year\u2019s\nUK election? Only time will tell.\nJehanPasanghaponderselectioncampaigns\n\u201c...no party appeals\nto me personally,\nI have decided to\nvote for a party\nbased on its\npolicies\u201d\n\n"

It was poignant\nthat the club operated at near to full\ncapacity for most of the night; it has\ncome up against much criticism by\nstudents in its lifetime and has seen\nmany a DJ perform to a sparse and\nstolid crowd over the years.\nAs part of the Union\u2019s Phase 3 project\nthat cost them \u00a32.4million, renovation\nof the venue started almost immediately after the Easter Carnival. da Vinci\u2019s bar will now only be available for\nuse until the end of the summer term.\nBeyond that, temporary replacement\nbars outside and in Activity Space 1\nwill open for the summer period.\nVisitors to Beit Quad will see the\nentrances to dBs boarded up, and in\nits current state, all furnishings have\nbeen removed and the walls and ceiling have been stripped down. The\nprominent structure left is a pillar\npositioned directly in front of the proposed position of the new stage. The\npillar has been the subject of much\ndebate over the past few months;\nUnion officials deliberated whether\nor not to take on the costly removal\nof the potentially stage-obstructing\nbeam.

EU ministers, both before and after the announcement by Greek president Karolos Papoulias, have\nstated that the EU would potentially be willing to lend 30\nbillion Euros to Greece at an interest rate of 5% per year.\nGreek ten-year government bonds are currently trading at over 11% on\nthe news of an S&P downgrade to junk status on Wednesday. Greek\ntwo-year bonds had a yield of 38% on Wednesday. The IMF is reportedly\nwilling to lend Greece a further 15 billion Euros at what would probably\nbe a lower rate than the EU loan. Adding to doubts over the success of\nthe package is speculation by analysts of whether 45 billion Euros will be\nenough to fix Greece\u2019s problems. German support, where 57% of the population is against a Greek bailout, is crucial for the success of the package.\nDominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the IMF, was set to meet with German\nchancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin this week to discuss possible options\nat the time of writing.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Tom Greany\nU\nkrainian lawmakers engaged in a sports day\nof sorts in their parliamentary chamber on\nTuesday.\nActivities included egg throwing,\nboxing, smoke bomb dispersal, and\ntug-of-war.

The reform was prompted\nby last year\u2019s conviction of four employees of Rio Tinto, a\nmining conglomerate, on charges of bribery and stealing\nstate commercial secrets.\nThat trial had created much concern in the international business committee because the twenty-year old existing laws on the subject were\nvague about what information constituted state secrets, especially with\nregards to commercial activity. The government moved to clarify what\ncommercial information could be considered a state secret.

The\n\u2018kitchen sink\u2019 dramas made famous by\nKen Loach and chums in the 60\u2019s come\nto mind and more recently, troubles in\nAfrica have been highlighted by films\nsuch as Hotel Rwanda and The Constant Gardener. The atmosphere of\nSamson and Delilah is certainly unpleasant and is at times almost overpowered by the bittersweet relationship at the heart of the story.\nThis debut from Australian director\nWarwick Thornton portrays the miserable existence some Aborigines have\nto endure in the outback, set against a\nbizarre love story between two youths.\nSamson awakes every morning with\nhis head inside a tin of glue; high off\nthe fumes, he endures his mundane life\nby irritating his brothers and throwing\nrocks at kangaroos. Delilah, on the\nother hand, has been entrusted with\nthe welfare of her grandmother and\nthey spend their days painting traditional canvasses only to be exploited by\nthe white shopkeeper who sells their\nwork for massive profit. Deliah soon\nbecomes the target for Samson\u2019s affections and though she initially reacts to\nthis with utmost disgust, her real feelings are much more mutual. After they\nboth endure brutality in their village,\nSamson steals a car and whisks Deliah\naway to Alice Springs where they tragically suffer worse treatment.\nThe strength of the film lies in the\nperformances of its two young stars\n(Rowan McNamara and Marissa Gibson). With no previous acting experi-ence, they manage to express all the\nnecessary emotions without a big\nscript. In fact the dialogue is so minimal that Samson only utters one word\nin the whole film \u2013 his name, which he\nbarely manages to do anyway.\nThornton, who is already a celebrated cinematographer, decides to let the\nfilm\u2019s visuals and sound track speak\nin place of the sparse screenplay. You\ncan almost smell the wretched heat\nof the desert which seems to burn a\nsense of hopelessness into its inhabitants\u2019 minds. The monotony of village\nlife is reflected in the steady Ska beats\nof Samson\u2019s brothers\u2019 band, who spend\nsunrise to sunset playing the same melodies every day. In contrast, the dangerous world of the city is further embellished by ominous sounds whereas\nSamson can only exhibit his rebellious\nspirit by listening to rock music.\nThe series of hardships and (out-rage) the pair encounter become ever\nmore shocking and intentionally never\nmake easy viewing. The only person\nwho shows the protagonists any compassion is a bridge-dwelling tramp\nwho shares his meagre food rations.\nThough an opportunity of hope is offered at the end, Warwick Thornton\ncompels the audience to feel disgusted\nThe most powerful film of the year\nDirector Warwick Thornton\nScreenwriter Warwick Thornton\nCast Rowan McNamara, Marissa\nGibson\nSamson and Delilah\nEdKnock\nEdKnock Film Editor\nExam Stress Relief\nand ashamed at what they are watch-ing. The suffering of Aborigines has\nlong been a controversial topic in Australian politics and Thornton, who is\nAborigine himself, presents a rather\nnegative picture of Aborigine life. He\nclaims it is a film of questions and he\ndoesn\u2019t present any answers.\nThe Biblical title is a reference to the\nA great slow-burning thriller\nDirector Roman Polanski\nScreenwriter Robert Harris\nCast Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan,\nKim Cattrall, Olivia Williams\nThe Ghost\nEdKnock\nEdKnock Film Editor\nInfamously finished whilst Roman\nPolanski was languishing under Swiss\nimposed house-arrest (perfect timing\nto break their tradition of neutrality!),\nThe Ghost is the latest in the recent\ntrend of political thrillers that prey on\nthe current distrust of modern politics\nand capitalism.\nAfter his predecessor dies in mysterious circumstances, a ghostwriter\n(Ewan McGregor) is hired to complete\nthe memoirs of ex-prime minister\nAdam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), who is\nunder suspicion for committing war\ncrimes during a \u2018War on Terror\u2019. The\nghostwriter (he is never named) soon\nfinds himself drawn into a conspiracy\nwhich could have far-reaching consequences for those involved.\nThe parallels between Brosnan\u2019s\ncharacter and Tony Blair are intentional with references made to Iraq,\nhis close relationship with the USA\nand his showman style of politics. This\ncould be used as a gimmick by a less-experienced director, but we are talk-Iron Man 2\nRobert Downey Junior dons\nthe crimson super suit in a\nsecond helping of high-tec\nass-kicking.\nPerfect for: comic book geeks\nRobin Hood\nRussell Crowe discards the\ntights for a serious take on\nthe legend...with WWII\nbeach landing craft?\nPerfect for: history buffs The A-Team\nFinally it has arrived.

Pierce Brosnan is perfect as the\narrogant ex-PM and Olivia Williams is\nwonderful as his seemingly innocent\nwife. Ewan Mcgreggor is on form as\nthe unfortunate protagonist, an average man who reluctantly unveils the\naforementioned mysteries.\nThe bleak landscape of coastal North\nGermany (substituting for New England) helps create an alien environment of politics and the dire situation\nthe protagonist finds himself in.

It\u2019s\nhard to understand Delilah\u2019s devotion\nto Samson and there\u2019s only so much\nmisery an audience can endure. If your\nfaith in human nature isn\u2019t ruined by\nthe end then you must be a saint. But\ndon\u2019t shy away from this film because\nof its difficult subject matter, it\u2019s challenging to watch and, once you\u2019ve\nrecovered, a thoroughly rewarding\nexperience.\n\n"

    "content": "11\nfelix FRIDAY 30 APRIL 2010\nCOMMENT\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nO\nn Thursday, the nation goes to the polls\nto decide its collective\nfate for the next four\nyears, more or less.\nWill we rally together and oust the\nincumbent, incompetent collection\nof crooks, clowns and codswallop-ers and sweep in to power...a pitiful\nparty of pedants, pissants and penny-pilferers? Oh dear. Will this be a case\nof out of the frying pan and onto the\ngriddle?\nOver the years, in an effort to appeal to more and more voters, the two\nmain parties have moved ever closer\nto the political centre with each passing election. If they were to continue\non their paths until Labour were conservative and Conservatives were\ndemocratically socialist in some Mad\nHatter\u2019s Boston Tea Party, I\u2019d be fine\nwith that. But no, instead they both\ngravitate in the unhappy middle such\nthat any real choice is rendered illu-sionary. Or maybe you could vote for\nRage Against The Machine. Sorry, I\nmean the Liberal Democrats.\nBut this isn\u2019t a diatribe on the woes\nof modern government. Goodness\nknows I\u2019m not up to offering piquant\ncritique on the probable outcomes of\nThursday\u2019s voting \u2013 without a swin-gometer, I wouldn\u2019t know where to\nbegin! And far be it from me to sug-gest, advise or command you who\nshould vote for. However, I do strongly suggest, earnestly advise and imperiously command that, whatever your\npolitical leaning, you do vote.\nSome people may say that suffrage\nis an essential human right and to exercise it is imperative. Some people\nmay say that, for all its faults, democracy is the best form of governance\nthat we have in this modern age and\nshould be supported. Some people\njust have an unhealthy obsession with\nsigning little crosses in boxes. But as\nfor me, I say you should vote for the\nvisceral thrill of having a good moan.\nComplaining is one of the great universal past-times and one we can all\nrelate to. How often has a friend from\nanother university asked after your\nwell-being at Imperial and, instead of\nenthusing about the plethora of clubs\nand societies, the scintillating social\nlife and the world-class education, do\nyou instead squeeze the pathos out\nof the mounting coursework, the minuscule free time and the suspiciously\nlecherous lecturers? It is perverse but\nwe only feel good when we feel awful.\nIt borders on masochism, the way\nwe derive pleasure from our own\npain. On any given topic, it is certain that someone can, and will, find\nsomething wrong. Their criticisms\ndon\u2019t even have to be logically or\nfactually correct. If whinging was an\nOlympic Event, we\u2019d send a clutch\nof Daily Mail columnists and come\nhome with gold, silver and bronze.\nMost of the time, we choose to\nmoan about the things we can\u2019t\nchange. Sport, the weather and public transport are all popular favour-ites. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with\nthis. A good gripe tends to stimulate\nconversation far better than a pleasant observation that everything\u2019s fine.\nEven if we disagree, we are spurred\non to talk, to communicate, to engage\nand the collective human experience\ngets just that little bit richer.\nBut when we start to complain\nabout things we can change, or could\nhave changed, things are not so pro-ductive. Dialogue is generated but it\nquickly turns sharp and accusatory. If\nwe feel so passionately, and if change\nor choice is possible, our opponents\ncry, why are we complaining over\na pint when we could be pursuing\nsomething better. Why indeed? The\nanswer is simple; action, any action,\nis difficult and vulnerable to failure.\nBut if we don\u2019t try then we can\u2019t fail.\nMoaning about our problems is infinitely safer than trying to solve them.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t be\nblow-hards and hypocrites.\nThat is why your vote is so impor-tant. It safeguards your unalienable\nand fundamental right to complain\nand the true satisfaction that only\ncomes from dissatisfaction. If you\nstand up and make a choice and it\nfalls flat, then oh well. At least you\ntried, and then any gripes, groans or\ngrievances that you may bear can be\nvented with impunity. No-one can resent you for complaining when you\u2019ve\nostensibly tried to change your world\nfor the better.\nReally, it is a win-win situation. If\nthe election goes against you, you\ncan rant to your heart\u2019s content in the\nUnion and if it goes for you then, hey,\nyou picked a winner! Personally, I\u2019m\nexpecting a hung parliament which\nwill mean, politically speaking, noone will be happy.\nSo really everyone can be happy!\nRhysDaviesreviews the art of complaining\n\u201cSome people say\nthat suffrage is an\nessential human\nright...\u201d\nA\nre the local Council out\nto get me? Are they deliberately reordering the\nlayout of Kensington\u2019s\nroads in order to flummox me as I move around the city? I\nstepped out into Exhibition Road last\nweek and found myself in a Tex Avery\ncartoon, being run over by an endless\nstream of buses driving in both directions down what had previously been a\none-way road. Taking the time to dust\nmyself down before having a piano\ndropped on me from a great height, I\nnoticed that this will be going on until cocking May 2011. What in Christ\u2019s\nname for! No-one looks at road markings anyway, you may as well just\nswitch the traffic lights off for a week\nand let the cars find their own equilib-rium. It\u2019s how nature intended.\nI could really give a toss how Exhibition Road is laid out, because I\u2019m about\nas likely to find myself careering down\nit in a Lamborghini next week as I am\nto replace David Beckham as captain\nat the World Cup. If they want to reverse the road markings, or make indicating optional on \u2018casual Fridays\u2019 or\nwhatever, then that\u2019s fine, but actually\ndirecting cars the wrong way down a\nroad so that they flank me like they\u2019re\nBoris Johnson\u2019s 3rd Motorised Division\nis just screwed up.\nAnd I know that won\u2019t matter soon\nbecause it\u2019s revision period and so most\nof us won\u2019t be seeing any cars for two\nmonths as we return to The Library,\nthe anti-Cheers where no-one knows\nyour name or gives a flying wazoo. And\nyeah, that\u2019s a little sad because the sun\nis out now, the clouds are bubbling up\nand the Wild Marquees are coming out\nof hiding to make their nest on Queen\u2019s\nLawn like a gigantic circus of bland-ness, but on the plus side it means I\u2019m\nless likely to be involved in a road traffic accident, and that\u2019s probably a proverb or something. It\u2019s definitely good,\nanyway.\nThe plan for this revision season is to\nhollow out part of the wall in the Science Museum library so that I can create a makeshift cocoon during the night\nusing old Richard Dawkins books and\nsaliva as a sort of improvised papier\nmach\u00e9. Then in the morning I can\ngnaw my way out, disgruntled at the\nsensation of awakening with my face\nthree inches from a copy of The God\nDelusion, ready to begin a new life as a\nfresh-faced student who is already dying inside.\nThis year will be particularly inter-esting, though, given that it\u2019s my first\nyear revising alongside my good friend\nCaffeine. Caffeine and I had been\ncasual, meet-up-once-a-week friends\nfor the most of my degree, but the last\nsix months have turned us into crazy\nOlsen-Twins-film-style best friends,\nand we now meet up several times a\nday to discuss earrings, makeup and\nwhy my life is now a pitiful drug-addled\nshadow of what it was when I started at\nImperial. Oh, and boys.\nSince most people seem to make\nlight of the fact that they can\u2019t function\nwithout caffeine, I suppose I should be\nmaking hilarious jokes about how completely incapable of thought or self-powered action I am without a cup of\noily despair every morning, but in reality it\u2019s actually a sad tale of dependency\nand having to sneak away to the burly\nmen and women dealing the drink\ndown the shady alleyways of the JCR.\nI\u2019m fairly sure it\u2019s going to cripple me\nover the course of the next six weeks.\nMe and my stomach lining are playing\nRussian roulette to see which one of us\ncaves in first from overconsumption of\nespresso.\nIn light of all this, don\u2019t be surprised\nif you find yourself outside the Business School in three weeks time playing chicken with the cars and the road\nmarkings while screaming fundamental theories to yourself, because after\na few days of solid note-reading you\u2019re\nprobably going to crave a bit of excitement in your life and nothing perks me\nup like making taxi drivers think they\u2019re\nabout to regret the last quip they made\nabout pedestrians.\nOn the offchance I don\u2019t make it to\nthe Comment pages in the coming\nweeks, remember - if they can\u2019t read\nyour handwriting, they can\u2019t mark you\ndown.\nAngryGeekonExhi-f*cking-bitionRoad\n\u201cYou may as\nwell just switch\nthe traffic lights\noff...let the cars\nfind their own\nequilibrium \u201d\n\n"

His recorded work is remarkably unre-markable, a kind of folk-rock, singer-songwriter mash-up that leaves a lot\nto be desired. Yet despite this, and the\nfact I did not know a single one of his\nsongs prior to the show, Frank Turner\nquite simply blew me away.\nMaybe it was the passion with\nwhich Turner performed \u2013 the\nA glorious London\nsummer for music lovers\nWhen & Where:\nWho:\nclouded over the festivals debut should\nbe completely ironed out. Aside from\nthe music, the festival aims to have\nsome sort of village fete vibe offering\n\u2018rural fayre,\u2019 which is all very quaint\nalthough one can hope that it won\u2019t\nsmell of manure. It\u2019s reasonably priced\nat \u00a333.33, which I guess is also nice if\nyou\u2019ve got a fetish for thirds.\nHyde Park plays host to this three day\nfestival on the 2nd-4th July, and boasts\nan eclectic mix of new and established\nacts. There is only one stage however,\nso some lineup scrutiny might be re-quired, although there are beer gardens and chill out areas to compliment\nthe music.\nWireless Festival\nFriday is a wholey poppy affair, headlined by Pink and other acts including\nthe Ting Tings, The Gossip and Plan\nB.\nSaturday is a traditionally more\ndance orientated day; this year it is\nheadlined by LCD Soundsystem with\n2manydj\u2019s, DJ Shadow, UNKLE and\nMissy Elliott also featuring. Snoop\nDogg is also listed as a special guest.\nSunday has the epic Jay Z along with\nLily Allen, Friendly Fires and Guitar\nlegend mophead Slash.

Whether\nit be Frank asking his good friend Dan\nto accompany him on stage while he\nsang a song written about the guy, or\nto tell us the story behind the song\nBombay Bicycle Club\nThe principle of \u2018Survival of The Fittest\u2019 holds as true for indie\nmusic as it does for the natural world.

    "content": "FOOD\nFood Editors\nFood Editors Chris Sim & Holly Cumbers\nChris Sim & Holly Cumbers\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 30 APRIL 2010 23\nfelix\nThe Pear Tree\u2019s welcoming exterior is definitely matched by its cosy interior\nWine and dine under the Pear Tree\nP\nub dinners. I don\u2019t do them\nthat often. Not that I don\u2019t\nlike the food. Nor is it that\nI don\u2019t like the atmosphere.\nIt just never occurs to me to\ndeliberately go to a pub for a proper\nsit-down meal. Combining the two\njust isn\u2019t my usual cup of Earl Grey.\nOk, once in a while when a big game\nis on I\u2019ll have some chips with a beer.\nAnd yes, I do love the places which\ndo proper hand cut chips complete\nwith skin and all. And once every blue\nmoon I\u2019ll have a burger with those\nfried potato accompaniments. But\nwith gastropubs around London receiving some well deserved praise I\nthought I\u2019d break this old habit and a\nvisit to a recently renovated pub by the\nname of The Pear Tree with some serious foodie intentions.\nTraditional British pub d\u00e9cor and an\nabsence of pretence were the first things\nthat struck me as I entered, features\nwhich agreed well with me. Slightly disappointing though was that our table\nwas situated in the main area of the pub\nand not the dining area, and whilst one\ncould say this gives an added element\nof atmosphere to a meal \u2013 it meant our\nconversations had to be conducted at\nslightly higher volumes.\nPleasingly, the menu is changed regularly by the owners and the dishes on offer appealed not only to those desiring\na heavy portion of red meat, but also to\nthose who wish to go for the healthier\noption of fish or vegetarian dishes. The\nstarters provided a prelude to what was\nto be a wholly satisfying meal. First\nPubs aren\u2019t the usual location for Chris Sim to have a sit-down meal, though this pub may have swayed his opinion\nYou\u2019d be surprised how interesting Canarian cuisine can be...\nChris Sim definitely did not regret bringing his tastebuds to these much-stigmatised Spanish islands\u2026\nB\nefore I left for the Canary\nIslands, or Las Canarias\nin Spanish, I must admit\nthat I considered leaving\nmy tastebuds at home. So\nwhat preconceptions led me to think\nof such radical action? I thought of\nWestern European tourists choosing\nto be imprisoned in their hotels or\nbronzing on the jam-packed beaches.\nI thought of cultureless bars eroding the Spanish flair and traditions.\nI thought of classic Spanish cuisine\nbeing carelessly adapted to the tastes\nof other Europeans. This last point,\nI thought, was surely too unbearable\nfor the sensory organs on my tongue.\nFortunately for my tastebuds,\neasyJet didn\u2019t charge extra for bringing them on the three-hour flight to\nthese picturesque islands northwest\nof the African coast. So I decided to\nbring them along. And upon leaving the overcrowded tourist zones\nand delving into the eateries of local\nCanarians, we were pleasantly surprised by a number of their foodie\ngems. First to entertain my tongue-mounted companions were what I\nthought are possibly the most interesting potatoes in the world. Known\nas papas arrugadas, or wrinkly pota-toes, they are simply seed potatoes\n(smaller and much sweeter than new\npotatoes, probably the first type of\npotatoes brought to Europe from\nthe Americas) slowly boiled, rubbed\nlightly with sea salt and casually\ndrizzled on with two delightful sauc-es. The first is mojo picante, a slightly\nspicy sauce containing olive oil, spicy\npaprika, cumin and lemon juice. Lose\nthe paprika and add some mild cori-ander, and you\u2019ve got mojo verde.\nThe former can really give a mild\nheaty kick, while the latter is a fantastic embodiment of fresh flavours.\nThese really do put our everyday\nroast potatoes to shame. Supremely\nsweet and fluffy in the middle, salty\non the exterior, and when combined\nwith the mojo sauces; well, it\u2019ll do\nyour \u2018mojo\u2019 a world of good. The next\nCanarian treat to dazzle my tongue-dwellers was a dessert, appropriately\nnamed as bienmesabe. It means \u2018it\ntastes good to me\u2019 and it really did\nlive up to its billing. It presented itself in the form of an almond cream,\nconsisting of Canarian almonds, sugar syrup, cinnamon and egg yolks.\nWhilst being too rich to eat on its\nown, its sweetness balanced by the\nnutty and earthy tones are great\nwhen smothered on plain foods like\ncrackers or toast.\nAnd the fun didn\u2019t stop there for\nmyself and my symbiotic travel bud-dies, for we were fortunate enough\nto visit a Canarian winery, where we\nwere treated to a memorable gastronomic experience. Our meal had too\nmany great dishes to mention, but\nmy favourite was a large plate lined\nwith sashimi-style octopus tentacles,\nthinly sliced and smothered with extra virgin olive oil, accompanied by\nthe perfect amount of local (much\ncheaper than the Russian) caviar.\nThe freshness of the octopus was in-credible, and its sweet flavour of the\nsea even more so.\nSo, after all, I guess my tastebuds\nwere pleased I brought them along.\nYours too would also be more than\nsatisfied, but it\u2019ll take just a wee bit\nof extra effort to go out, explore the\nlocal towns, villages and countryside and find the real flavours of Las\nCanarias.\nFood: 8.0\nValue: 7.0\nService: 7.0\nAmbience: 6.5\nOverall: 7.25/10\nup was a white onion tart with goats\u2019\ncheese and salad which was probably\nthe pick of the first courses. It possessed\na good balance of sweet caramelised\ntones from the onion, rich buttery notes\nfrom the pastry and an injection of saltiness from the cheese. The duck rillettes\nwith salami, red onion marmalade and\nbread was satisfying but a stronger\nduck punch was needed to compete\nwith the sweet marmalade. The mussels in a white wine sauce had the right\nflavour combinations, but the freshness\nof the shell dwellers was not quite up to\nstandard.\nThe mains were also of a pleasantly satisfying standard. Their Aberdeen angus\nbeef burger met my expectations, being\nfull of meaty tones and oozing gorgeous\nbeefy juices, and was also of a size which\ncould actually fit in my mouth without\nhaving to crush its environment of fresh\nbun, lettuce and tomato. Many of the\naccompanying chips were slightly over-fried; however those that were cooked\nto perfection possessed a harmonious\nequilibrium of fluffy centre and crunchy\nexterior. Also escorted with a side of\nchips was a sirloin steak with red wine\nsauce. The quality of the steak itself was\nof a pretty high standard and, whilst the\nred wine sauce had a level of richness, it\nwas slightly too sweet. Probably the best\nmain was the salmon fillet with crushed\nnew potatoes, fennel and purple sprouting broccoli. No faults were in evidence\nhere: well cooked potatoes, nicely seasoned vegetables and fresh, perfectly\npan fried salmon, though it could have\ndone with a touch more fennel to really\nbring everything together.\nTo finish off our meal, a couple of\nmemorable desserts made their way to\nour table. The home-made banoffee pie\nhad an excellent balance of sweet toffee\nand banana, held together by the dessert\u2019s delicious gooeyness. Even better\nthan this, however, was the chocolate\nterrine. It was pretty diminutive, but\nboth myself and my diners only needed\na small helping to experience the full on,\ndivinely rich chocolate-truffle-esque\nnature of this dish.\nThe portion sizes were agreeable for\nthe price, around \u00a35 for a starter, \u00a39-10\nfor a main and \u00a34 for desserts. We accompanied our meal with a refreshing\nbottle of Ros\u00e9, which, at \u00a315 I thought\nwas quite fair. Service was attentive by\npub standards though the courses could\nhave left the kitchen a tad quicker. So to\nconclude, I feel that the Pear Tree did\nhelp me to consolidate those two occasions which are normally separate in\nmy own eyes: a satisfying meal within a\npleasant pub setting.\nPapas arrugadas (wrinkly potatoes) with mojo picante (spicy, zingy sauce)\n\n"

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 30 APRIL 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nF\nor every Imperial student continuing in science after graduation,\nthere\u2019s an Imperial student looking for a lucrative job or internship in the City.\nBut what will come of the City\nunder a new Government? What\nwill happen to the City\u2019s graduate\njob market? Will there even be a\nCity to look for employment in?\nGovernment policies are a major\nfactor in business location \u2013 and\nrelocation \u2013 decisions for financial\nfirms. With strong bank-bashing\nrhetoric coming from all major UK\npolitical parties, concerns are being raised that they may flood out\nof London as regulations against\nthem tighten.\nA central idea for New Labour\nwas to limit penalisation of the financial sector to taxation, so that\ntheir loss would at least be Treasury\u2019s gain. At their peak, taxes\nfrom the City accounted fully for\none seventh of all Government\nrevenues. But that plan now clearly lies in ruins \u2013 with hundreds of\nbillions in bailout money going\nto the banks. All the parties now\nagree on a \u201cconsumer-protection\u201d\nagency, higher capital holding re-quirements, and tighter overall\nregulations, both domestically and\ninternationally.\nThe Conservatives are promising to give extra powers to the\nBank of England to supervise financial companies, ensuring that\nthey take on less risk. Labour\nwants to keep the current \u201cTripartite\u201d arrangement for financial\nregulation, consisting of Treasury,\nthe Bank of England, and the Financial Services Authority. In ad-dition, they will create a new body\nwith the power to tell banks what\nthey are allowed to include in their\nemployment contracts. The Liberal Democrats are swinging heavily towards the latter half of their\nname by demanding the toughest\nrules of all. They would break up\nbanks \u2013 even ones not owned by\nthe Government that performed\nwell during the crisis \u2013 and then\nforce the smaller banks to lend\nsubstantially more than they have\nbeen doing so far.\nThe question that many students\nin particular have been asking is\nwhether this will drive leading financial firms away from London.\nThere are a few relevant points to\nconsider. First of all, regulations\nare tightening almost everywhere,\nnot just in the UK. For example,\nthis is true of Switzerland, which is\nthe most common suggested destination for financial firms currently\nbased in London. Secondly, no one\nexpects the Government to be as\ntough as its talk, especially when\nit is itself such a big shareholder\nin leading banks. Thirdly, the last\ntime similar concerns where raised\nabout a major financial centre losing its influence was New York in\nthe late \u201870\u2019s. It did lose out slightly\nin relative terms, but not in terms\nof absolute numbers of employees,\nprofits, revenue and so on. And it\ntook well over a decade to recover.\nIt is natural for Imperial students\nconsidering a future profession\nin finance to factor in the parties\u2019\nview on the industry into their voting decision. There are two prevailing views on this. Some may\nfeel that more regulation will ensure greater long term success for\nthe City, and would favour Labour\nand the Lib Dems over the Conservatives. In particular, if they\nfeel the main problem is excessive\nrisk taking they may prefer Labour,\nwhereas if they are concerned that\nbanks are undermining their own\nposition by not lending enough\nthen they will find themselves in\nagreement with the Lib Dems.\nAlternatively, would-be financiers may consider the banks and\nother financial firms as the best-placed to be making the sort of decisions that regulators would prefer to make instead. They will feel\nthat fewer regulations will mean\ngreater success for those looking\nto start a career in the field. They\nmay therefore be disheartened\nto see the Conservatives often\nmatching the other two parties\u2019\nbank-bashing. However, even if\nthe Conservatives keep regulations as tight as they are, they are\nunlikely to tighten them further as\nzealously as the other two parties\nlikely will. They are therefore still\nthe best choice for advocates of\nlaissez faire, albeit with a massive\npinch of salt.\nVOTING TO\nSAVE YOUR BIG\nCITY DREAM JOB\nfelix did a little scouting to find out what the people voting actually thought about the General\nElection in respect to their current endeavours and future careers.\nf\nf\nE\nE\nE\nWhat are the students saying?\nPreviously a mildly-apathetic Tory, the progressive\nimprovements in the Liberal Democrat manifesto and\nmanner have gradually won me over. Employing ideas beyond\nrhetoric, with a message that actively supports my livelihood as\na student and scientist, the party under the stalwart leadership\nof Nick Clegg has come a long way from its period of wandering\nin the wilderness during the 90\u2019s and 00\u2019s. I feel content that the\nLiberal Democrats offer an authentic opportunity for me to do\nmore and live more happily, both as a scientist starting out in life,\nand as a Briton who cares about our collective wellbeing.\nThe PhD student\nMarcus Shepheard, Epidemiology\nWhen I graduate they will have changed the\nNHS for better or worse, and I\u2019ll have to work in\nit. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 policies seem to be showy without\nany substance - lots of talk about patient contracts and choice\nwithout addressing the big financial concerns we\u2019ll face. There\u2019s\nnot much between Labour and Conservative health policies, but\nthe Tories haven\u2019t done enough to convince me that their one off\n\u00a38000 for lifetime elderly care adds up - and their refusal to back\ncancer targets means I\u2019m voting Labour (tactically, at least).\nThe Medic\nJaimie Henry, 3rd Year\nSo much for Conservatives being the most pro-City party; I\nthink that their policy to go ahead with a banks tax without\ninternational cooperation would be detrimental to London\u2019s\nCity status \u2013 Labour has the right idea on this one. Having said\nthat, after the recent fraud charges against Goldman Sachs,\ninternational cooperation is probably not a mile off. The most\nimportant factor is the recovery of our own economy and\nGordon\u2019s \u2018tax on jobs\u2019 doesn\u2019t help here, so a Conservative\nvote for me! Oh, and Lib Dems \u2013 what are you thinking about..\nwiping out our defence system...?\nThe Aspiring Businessman\nBrad Jones, IC Finance Society President\nAlthough this General Election won\u2019t affect me too much for a\nfew years now, it is also my first time voting in one. I really do\nwant to make sure I come out of university with available jobs on\noffer, but I also don\u2019t particularly fancy looking at the sum of my\nstudent loans debts either. The Liberal Democrats are obviously\ntrying to tap into the student vote, and with Cleggmania aside\nfor just one moment, they are the only party of the three to\nannounce their plans to phase out student loans. This might\ninclude current undergraduates too, so I\u2019m in. David Cameron\u2019s\nright though, we can\u2019t go on like this, with suspicious minds.\nThis election could potentially decide the most\nimportant five years of my life, but as a foreigner, I\ndon\u2019t even have a say in the matter. I can\u2019t vote.\nI hope to stay here after I graduate, to work as a teacher.\nHowever, it\u2019d be unfair for me to just expect to be allowed\nto stay. I just hope whoever\u2019s voted in gives skilled migrants\na chance to prove ourselves in shortage occupations that\nno-one wants, like teaching or nursing, just as I\u2019d like to as a\nmaths teacher. Everyone loves a maths teacher.\nThe International Student\nFernando Revilla, 3rd year, Maths\nBUSINESS EDITOR SINA ATAHERIAN LOOKS INTO\nWHAT MAY COME OF THE CITY AND ITS JOBS\nThe Fresher\nLillie Baines, Biochemistry\nDo these Freshers actually care about the Election?\nGENERAL ELECTION\n\n"

manifesto\nNew research shows that \u2018Fuck\nOur Imperial Lives\u2019 is \u201cwhiniest\nfacebook group ever\u201d\nIn a paper to be published in the Lancet next week, new research has shown\nthat the amount of whining, bitching\nand moaning on the \u201cFuck Our Imperial Lives\u201d (FOIL) Facebook group is\n300 times the normal amount.\nThis startling discovery has given\nsignificant weight to critics of the\ngroup who have said that its members\nneed to \u201cget some fucking perspective.\u201d\nJoe Schnitzel, the author of the pa-per, said, \u201cWe accounted for a variety of different factors, for example we\nnormalised our results to account for\nexam time stress and depression. But\nthe levels of whining were still well\nabove normal.\u201d\nCommon gripes posted on the Facebook group include moaning about\nthe number of exams coming up and\none student even complained that they\n\u201cShould\u2019ve gone to Kingston.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to pass judgement on\nindividuals,\u201d Mr Schnitzel said, \u201cbut\nthey sound like a bunch of pussies.\nWell, more than a bunch; more like 829\npussies. That\u2019s a lot of pussy. Mmm.\u201d\nIn response to the group, Imperial\nCollege\u2019s Health Centre is taking extra\nsteps to ensure that Imperial students\ndon\u2019t get too worried or upset during\nthe exam period. The new measures\nare said to include: A weekly trip to\nEast London, speed-dating events in\nthe JCR and in extreme cases, encouraging students to \u201cman up\u201d, quit their\n\u201cjibber-jabber\u201d and \u201cpity the fools\u201d\nwho didn\u2019t get into university.\nS\neeing as we have decided that\nall of our options for voting\nin the General Election will\nmost likely end us up with a\ncompletely incapable fool in\ncharge of the country, not to mention\nthe fact that voting gives you cancer\n(see Daily Mail\u2019s list of things that give\nyou cancer - it\u2019s been recently updat-ed), Hangman has decided to run for\nelection within the Kensington con-stituency. Unfortunately, although we\napplied to join in the with the televised\nLeaders\u2019 Debate, we were rejected, with\nvarious different media establishments\nciting the problem as the fact one of\nour leader\u2019s aides was ginger. He\u2019s apparently desiccate within seconds under the studio lighting. Fair do\u2019s, we\nsaid. We sacked him and still couldn\u2019t\nget TV airtime, so we thought we\u2019d like\nto some of our best policies here:\nBurqa-wearing has had a lot of bad\npress recently, what with people trying to get it banned in public places\nand civil service jobs etc... We find this\ntype of discrimination appalling, and\nso should you. We intend to tackle this\nissue accordingly. I agree with Nick,\nwhen he says we need more policemen\non the streets. Policemen under the\nHangman government will take on the\nnew role of \u2018Ugly Patrol\u2019. Their job will\nbe to enforce a strict \u2018Non-Ugly Policy\u2019,\na law which will be passed as soon as\npossible. This will involve the compulsory darkened material covering those\nwho\u2019s facial features are just plain offensive to the rest of the world. All\npeople with a BMI of 25+ will also be\nfined for every calorie they eat and be\nrequired to wear large cardboard boxes\ninstead of clothes. The boxes typically\nfound next to households that have recently purchased a new fridge-freezer\nunit. We already have support from\nvarious members of the Tory party on\nthis issue; David Cameron agrees with\nthis policy, adding \u2018When I was on my\ngap yaaah there were some terribly ugly\npeople in Tanzanaaah.\u201d It has also been\nreported he \u201cchundered everywhere\u201d in\nsight.\nAnother policy close to our hearts is\nthe issue of immigration. Our immigration policy is perhaps not as strict\nas other parties\u2019, in the sense that we\u2019re\nnot going to limit the number of people who are allowed to move to the\nUK to live and work. We\u2019re not going\nto impose testing for English language\nskills, or a points-based system to allow\nonly skilled workers to enter the coun-try. Instead, all immigrants will have\nto enter the country via the delightful\ncity of Hull. Here they can spend some\ntime with the pregnant chavs, catch a\nfew STIs and possibly develop a heroin\n75%\nAccording to a YouC*nt poll,\n75% of voters like to see\nGordon Brown\u2019s prolapsed\nanus fed to a hedgehog\n53\nThenumberofordinarypeople\nthat David Cameron has met\nduring this election, which\nbringshislifetimetotalupto56\naddiction. Their media and TV exposure will be limited to watching Jeremy\nKyle, reading The Sun newspaper, with\nthe weekly treat of the Eastenders om-nibus. They can learn from experience\nwhat the UK is really like, and after a\nmonth\u2019s trial period, be given the option to go back to their war-torn home.\nWhen the Hangman Party comes to\npower (we will), we plan to scrap educational testing such as SATs, GCSEs\nand A-levels in favour of the new Wikipedia Proficiency Test. We, as a party,\nbelieve that a Wikipedia knowledge-based economy will put as top in the\nworld for inaccuracy and hilarious in-jokes that moderators have missed.\nWe hope to reduce the national debt\nby re-instating the debt owed by 18\nAfrican countries.

BY DAN WAN\nT\nhe manifesto launches from the three main par-ties, Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats,\nyielded some good news for all with an occupational interest in science. Unlike the two previous\nelections in \u201901 and \u201905, Labour and the Conservatives have\npushed scientific policies onto the forefront by featuring\nthem in a section, albeit limited, of their 2010 manifestos.\nThe UK\u2019s scientific industries certainly stake a claim that\nmuch more attention should be paid to policies directly affecting them. Businesses using elements of physics alone\ncontribute 6.4% of the UK\u2019s national economic output; this is\nas much as the finance, banking and insurance sectors com-bined. This figure doesn\u2019t include the business sector based\non biological, medical, engineering or chemical principles\neither. In stark comparison, one only has to look how much\npublic debate arises when the financial services sector is under scrutiny. To take it from another angle, The Campaign for\nScience and Engineering (CaSE) claims that there are about\nthree million people in the UK with a scientific background,\nor 7% of the electorate; that\u2019s more than enough to win or lose\nsuch a tight election as this.\nTo put it simply, the better corporate science and engineering is allowed to perform by the Government, the more jobs\navailable to those qualified, i.e. students graduating from institutions like Imperial.\nCaSE have lobbied the importance of science and its related\ndisciplines to the leading political parties in the run up to the\nGeneral Election, and even wrote to the leaders of the three\nmain parties asking them to set out their policies on science.\nDr. Hilary Leevers, Assistant Director of CaSE told felix that\n\u201cCaSE and others have worked to show that there is a science\nvote to be won.\n\u201cThe need for the parties to respond to the coherent demands of scientists and engineers has ensured that all the\nmain party manifestos covered these areas, and they even\nform the basis of the newly born Science Party.\u201d\nDr. Leevers stressed the fact there was a very important decision to be made by scientists and engineers.\n\u201cMany felix readers will want to know how the different\nparties intend to support education in science, engineering,\ntechnology and mathematics, and the careers in the academic\nand private sector that follow on from it.\nIt is up to voters to decide how they take this information\ninto account; they may choose to vote for the party they believe has the best policies or the candidate they believe will\nwork the hardest for science and engineering.\nHelp decide who will be working on policies affecting science and engineering in the next Parliament.\u201d\nA student scientist\u2019s vote\nA\ncademically, the British\ninstitutions\u2019 research\noutput comfortably\nsits in the \u2018world -class\u2019\nbracket. However, there\nare growing fears that without the\nright investment into academic science from the next Government,\nthe UK are at risk of falling behind\ninternational competition.\nEarmarked as the next international powerhouse, China\u2019s spending on research funding has increased 20% every year since 1999,\nand has overtaken the UK\u2019s equivalent spending. South Korea\u2019s \u201cUKorea\u201d programme has seen a surge\nin funding in the nanotechnology\nindustry, and overall spending on\nprivate and public research that exceeds \u00a335 billion. The USA already\nproduces globally-leading research,\nbut President Barack Obama last\nyear pledged a multi-billion stimulus package into science research\nfunding, hoping to achieve levels\nof scientific output \u201cat the height of\nthe space race\u201d in the 1960s.\nNeedless to say, the way the UK\u2019s\nacademic output rises or falls in the\ncoming years, the currently prestigious reputation of Imperial College,\nas a specialist institute for science,\nengineering, technology and medi-cine, will follow suit.\nThe overall budget for science and\nits associated research fields is set\nout the Government and divided up\nbetween the UK\u2019s seven Research\nCouncils according to their relative\nsize and importance. With their\nportion of the overall budget, each\ncouncil then goes about setting a\ngeneraldirectionofresearchintheir\nrespective field. This is done by allocating funding to projects proposed\nto them by research groups and departments from universities across\nthe UK. Imperial College, as an insti-tution, has a strong standing in the\nBritish scientific community, but\naccess to funding is likely to follow\nany national trends when budget\ncuts are concerned.\nEffectively, the larger the cuts a\nnew Government makes to overall\nscience and research budgets, the\nless PhD opportunities there will be\nfor those looking for postgraduate\nstudy in science.\nAcademically speaking...\nCaSE\u2019s invitation to elaborate\ntheir science spokespeople more of a\nchance to release a more detailed and\nspecialised manifesto for anyone who\ncares to read. Gordon Brown is the latest of the three to respond, but detailed\nanalysis of the situation was accompanied with an impressive specialised\nScience Manifesto.\nDavid Cameron\u2019s response expands\non his manifesto pledges and veers\ntowards a much wider vision of advancement in British science and associated industries. It is considerably\nshorter than Nick Clegg\u2019s response\nhowever. The Lib Dem leader\u2019s return letter demonstrates an intricate\nknowledge of the\nworkings\nbehind\nboth academic\nand corporate\nscience,\nmentioning\nissues surrounding post-doctoral opportunities,\ngender imbalances in the industry and\nthe importance of peer-, and not gov-ernmental, review.\nhe\n-round-t l t iti\nI\nf it hadn\u2019t quite clicked already,\nthis General Election is important;\nnotjustforthecountryasawhole,\nbut for you too. As Imperial stu-dents, under- or postgraduate,\nyou are the next generation of scientists,\nengineers, doctors and businessmen of\nthe UK (if not the world). Graduating\nfrom a \u2018world-class\u2019 university certainly\nsets your bar high for career aspirations,\nand the fields of academia or business\nyou\u2019ll be leading will either suffer or\nprosper under the new Government to\nbe formed on May 7th.\nHence, this General Election may have\na significant bearing on all Imperial students graduating in the coming years.\nAs much as you protest, your days as\na student will come to an end. Finding\nyourself knee-deep in the mire that is the\njob market may come as a shock to the\nsystem, but at least this General Election\nwill allow you to have some say in how\npainful or delightful this shock may be.\nMoving away from a generic comparison of the three main parties\u2019 manifesto\npledges, felix is looking into the policies\nand issues being discussed that will directly affect a fledgling workforce entering the industries of science (academic\nor otherwise) and City business. felix will\nadditionally inspect the policies that could change\nthe way you live\nout your remaining years as a\nstudent.\nherwise) and City business. felix will\nx\nare g\nright\nAc\nadditi\ncies t\nthe w\nout yo\ning ye\nstuden\nonally inspect the poli-ha\nwa\nour\near\nnt.\nnally inspect the poli-at could change\ny you live\nr remain-rs as a\n.\nT\nhe Campaign for Science and\nEngineering (CaSE) is a leading political advocate for science and engineering in the\nUK.

It was a mistake \u2013 anticipating\nthe camel expedition like some glorified amusement park ride \u2013 though it\nwasn\u2019t mine alone: carpet burns, aching\nscrotums, motion sickness, they were\nall symptoms of what my fellow excur-sionists would agree as a case of bad\ninvestment.\nYet there we were, sand dominating the\nterrain and filling our boots, smog enshrouding the Saharan skies and blinding us from a stellar spectacle on the\nprevious evening, I perching on a saddle\nperplexed over a crossword puzzle I was\nfailing to solve.\nSo I gave in: \u201cKing Lear\u201d, said the\nsolutions. I cursed myself for the\nfoolhardiness.\nCurious how, like guilt, regrets are the\nmotivation that send people achieving\nextraordinary things and visiting extraordinary places, if only in a redemptive kind of way. I like travelling with\nregrets, though in a more innocent man-ner: finding myself failing to go to a place\nI really wanted to visit, and sipping that\nbile of disappointment, propels me to\ndevote some time and effort in returning\nto the country for what I have previously\nmissed out. And one shard of regret, of\ndisappointment, had taken me back to\nMorocco, once again a hitch-hike from\nLondon for the charity Link Community\nDevelopment.\nIthadsproutedayearago:Iwasperched\non the customer\u2019s seat, in a room that\nnever ceased to impart a resemblance to\na hospital ward \u2013 even in memory \u2013 grappled by the figures the travel agent had\njabbed into a calculator.\nAnna, the Morocco Hitch partner as-of-2009, even gave a squeal at the sight of\nthe price tag.\nWith many more agencies eager to\npillage our wallets, which were pretty\nempty by that stage, the desert excursion\ndidn\u2019t quite happen.\nThis time, though, nothing was going to stop me. Even if it meant leaving\n\u201cFinding myself\nfailing to go to a\nplace I wanted to\nvisit propels me\nto return to the\ncountry for what I\nhave missed out\u201d\nbehind Tori, my new hitch partner, and\nventure into the Sahara among strangers.\nWe reached base camp after a two-hour\nride. The camel stooped as though bowing after a laborious yet lousy perform-ance, whose audience rose from their\nslumber and feigned a clap or two so as\nnot to hurt the producers\u2019 feelings. The\nBerber nomads, our guides and hosts at\nthe desert camp where we stayed over-night, produced a handshake and good-bye, as each of us descended from the\nmountainous mass of fabric that insulated the camel\u2019s hump, and fled gingerly\nfrom the final round of formalities.\nThat moment felt like an end to my\nthree-day excursion into the Sahara;\nsure, the full circuit which began/ended\nin Marrakech didn\u2019t conclude until after\na 13-hour drive through treacherous terrain \u2012 though the landscape did shape like\na geological Elysium \u2012 in terms of my redemption trip the conclusion was drawn\nupon the sand the moment I dismounted.\nThus, deliverance. Unshackled, unbounded from a repaid debt. But was I\ngoing to get away this time humming\nNon, je ne regrette rien with a clear\nconscience?\nNot exactly.\n*\nI couldn\u2019t have found a better refuge than\nunder the shade of a grocery store, just off\nthe car park - secluded, yet enough hype\nfor a small touristic town to distract myself from the soaring temperature and\nmigraine.\nAnd with most people from my tour\ngone astray and yet to return from the\nksar of A\u00eft Benhaddou, a pit stop en\nroute to the Sahara, I wasn\u2019t exactly going\nanywhere.\nAnd with every repetitive throb that\npounded against my skull, I felt more and\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to\ncontribute towards\nan already existent\nbegging culture\u201d\nmore susceptible to the minute details\nof observations I was absorbing, and the\nsentiments they represented.\nI reminisced idle Moroccans by the\nksar, or fortified city, touting and has-sling, and pondered on ways they could\nhave better made use of their youth.\nI remembered the Lonely Planet entry claiming that Moroccans regarded\nAsians as the most lucrative of nation-alities, and lamented that my skin colour\nwasn\u2019t exactly doing me any favours.\nI scrutinised the money-grabbing\ncamera posers in traditional clothing,\nthe shopkeepers, tour bus drivers, wait-ers, tourists, school children; their attire,\ntheir mannerism, down to the way they\nsaunter, meander, scuttle \u2013\nThe girl approached me. I had seen\nher earlier, an individual inconspicuous\namong the uniform-clad, backpack-slung\nchildren chortling in childly glee. The\ndramatics that followed was unworldly,\nunchildlike: the smile vanished, shoulders slacked, eyes watered as she steered\ntowards me just as her peers selected and\npursued their marks across the park.\nAnd before she could even reach me,\nshe had already extended her empty\npalm. She may have muttered something\npleadingly in French, but the gesture\nalone was lucid.\nI rattled a ritual response.\nLa. No.\nSafi. Enough.\nThere was little meaning those two\nmeagre words of Arabic could have con-veyed. They were the means to reject a\nplea and to rid of a nuisance \u2013 she did\nwince a little from the crudeness before\nThe desert camp at a visually disappointing sunrise\nThe breathtaking Dad\u00e8 Gorge\n\n"

    "content": "12 felix FRIDAY 30 APRIL 2010\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCOMMENT\nI\n\u2019ve been at home now for a few\nweeks; naturally I\u2019ve spent a disproportionately large amount\nof my time on the Internet. You\nhave the few standard sites you\ncheck when you come online. If you really have nothing else to do, you might\ngo through them a second time, just in\ncase you missed something. If you really don\u2019t want to revise, you might resort\nto opening them all in separate tabs and\njust refreshing them. As a result of this,\nI\u2019ve been able to keep alarmingly up-to-date with current affairs. During term I\nwouldn\u2019t know if a comet hit Scotland,\nbut over the last four weeks if a priest\nmolested a child half way around the\nworld I\u2019d have known in minutes.\nNaturally, I can\u2019t have failed to miss\nthe only two stories for the last two\nweeks, Icelandic Volcano and ELECTION FEVER!!!1!!11eleven. I\u2019m now\ngoing to fall into the trap of making a\njoke about the two. They could have\njust had the one headline for two weeks:\nThings eject hot gas. My mum thought\nit was funny\u2026 Anyway, as I have no real\nopinions regarding the Volcano (except\nits name, is there anyone at Imperial\nwho can tell me how to pronounce it?)\nI\u2019ll rant about the election.\nI want it to be clear that I don\u2019t care\nwhich way you vote. All I want to do\nis espouse my opinions on what I\u2019ve\nseen; by all means ignore them/write\na response telling me why I\u2019m an idiot.\nI\u2019m the first to admit I\u2019m not normally\nabreast of politics. I don\u2019t even really\nunderstand how our Parliament works,\nbut that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t scream\nopinions from the rooftops like everyone else.\nMy main gripe is the Liberal Democrats\u2019 current campaign strategy. Fair\nplay to them, they\u2019ve done very well to\nmake themselves a serious contender\nin the election. However, I saw Nick\nClegg on the news a few days ago appealing to the \u201cYoung people/First\ntime voters\u201d portion of the electorate.\nHe said repeatedly that young people\ncould shape the future of this country.\nSo by voting Lib Dem can we have the\ncountry as we want it? They\u2019re going\nto abolish tuition fees and make all\nstudent loans into free grants instead?\nStrange, I didn\u2019t find that in their mani-festo. Not that I looked.\nHe went on to lambast the \u201cOld Parties\u201d for telling young people that their\nvotes don\u2019t count and that they\u2019re wasted if they don\u2019t vote Tory or Labour. I\ndon\u2019t recall either Dave or Gordon telling me my vote didn\u2019t count. I think\nthey both just said \u201cVote for me\u201d. From\nmy point of view, it seems that Nick\nClegg is campaigning entirely on the\nfact that his party isn\u2019t \u201cOld\u201d. Does that\nmean they\u2019ll be any different? I suppose we can\u2019t really know unless they\nget into power, but as much as they\nensure me that they\u2019re different, they\nall look the same to me. Just because\nthey haven\u2019t had a chance to mess up\nyet doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t if we give\nthem that chance.\nI dislike this method of campaigning.\nWithout actually mentioning any poli-cies, Nick Clegg is manipulating people into thinking that he will genuinely\nbring change. I realise that this is essentially what all political campaigning\nis, but his way of making very vague\npromises but assuring us that his party\nis different really grates on me.\nAll of the parties are as guilty as each\nother though. David Cameron is being\nparticularly lazy; he looked at America, saw that promising change worked\nthere and has just adopted that. Of\ncourse the Lib Dems scuppered his\nplans by doing the same thing and becoming serious contenders. The Tories\nstill say that their change is the better one. To determine the difference\nwould actually require looking at their\npolicies, which I\u2019m trying to avoid at all\ncosts.\nI don\u2019t really know what Labour\nare saying. I watched the first debate\nthough and David Cameron made\na good point. After Gordon Brown\npromised some sort of reform (the\nhouse of Lords?) Dave pointed out\nthat they\u2019ve had 13 years to do that,\nany promises now just feel hollow after\nthat. Of course, all of the parties promises are just as much bollocks, but we\nknow that Labour are just saying theirs\nbecause of the election.\nAnyway, enough ranting. We are\nscientists so we should try to vote in a\nscientific way. Some sort of blind test\nwhere you just see policies and not\nwhose they are, that would be good.\nChances are you\u2019ve heard some policies by now so you might recognise\nthem, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\nI recommend everyone interested\nshould go to http://voteforpolicies.org.\nuk, which provides just that service. It\nincludes the policies of six parties: Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat,\nGreen, UKIP and BNP. It gives you 9\nissues, of which you can choose which\nare most important to you and those\nare the areas where you compare the\npolicies. The results are quite interest-ing, what have you got to lose? Revision time?\nAdamFalkrecommendsvotingforpolicies\n\u201cMy main gripe\nis the Liberal\nDemocrats\u2019\ncurrent campaign\nstrategy...\u201d\nCollege Hardship Fund 2009\nMoney worries affecting your studies?\nEU and Overseas students may be eligible for a grant from the\nCollege Hardship Fund (home students can apply to the\nAccess to Learning Fund.)\nWe understand that despite careful planning some students may face\nhigher than expected costs or a financial emergency.

Imperial I claimed the IM1\npennant (16th overall), Imperial IV\nwon the novice pennant (103rd over-all) and the elite lightweights came a\nclose second in category (8th overall).\nAn alumni reception was held at the\nclub with several VIPs in attendance\nincluding the Imperial College London\nRector Sir Keith O\u2019Nions.\nThe Imperial Lightweight 8+ consisted of Ole Tietz, Adam Freeman-Pask,\nOli Mahony, William Fletcher, Andrew\nCraig, Jamie Kirkwood, Benjamin Jack\nRowe & Tommy Junior. The head race\nwas the crew\u2019s second outing in that\ncombination, and only the seventh time\nthey had all been out in an 8+. Most of\nthe preparation and focus consisted\nof taking the piss out of Jamie Kirkwood who won the Sculler\u2019s Head of\nthe River in late November of last year.\nFreeman-Pask: \u201cHe got a lot of stick\nfor being shit, but when he switched to\nbowside\u2026 and being in the three seat...\nthis only got worse. \u2018Kirkwood to tower\nrequesting a flyby. Negative Kirkwood,\nthe pattern is full.\u201d The banter was re-lentless, complete with general retard\nelbow-licking impressions.\nFreeman-Pask himself offered motivational soundbites to the crew instructing them to \u201cDrop the bread in\nthe toaster and wait for it to pop.\u201d As\nfelixSport presents to you the\nfinal league table of the year\nImperial secure two top twenty finishes at HORR\nChristina Duffy Rowing for the race itself, cox Seb Pearce was\nthe hero. Coming under Hammersmith Bridge they approached another\ntideway crew and could overhear the\ncoxbox: \u201c150 years of rowing came\ndown to this day.\u201d Pearce: \u201c150 years\nof rubbish rowing, let\u2019s push off this\ndriftwood.\u201d Earlier while marshalling\nanother crew was having difficulty ma-noeuvring and the cox was yelling for\nmore room from other crews. \u201cShe\u2019ll\nneed a lot of room\u201d, murmured Pearce\nbefore mimicking the beeping sounds\nof a reversing truck.\nThe novice 8+ were delighted with\ntheir win and coach Ross Smitheman was close to tears at hearing of\nthe result after weeks of tough basic\ntraining. The crew were Tom Pearson,\nAndy Gordon, Will Laughlin, Finlay\nMcPhail, Sietse Braakman, Hal Bradbury, Luke Johnston & Tom Shaw.\nThey were coxed by WEHORR IC1\ncox Tom Fieldman. When asked about\nthe differences in coxing women he\nreplied: \u201cI recall none of the girls wee-ed at the start, whereas with the men\nI think the tide was rising before our\nrace, even though the river was going\nout to sea.\u201d The crew took the novice\npennant 16 places (103rd) and three\nseconds (18:48.78) ahead of Oxford\nBrookes (18:52.91).\nIn the first boat were Simon Steele,\nRory Sullivan, Jonny Rankin, Henry\nGoodier, Mark Mearing-Smith, Leo\nCarrington, Danny Bellion, Alex Gillies & cox Henry Fieldman they won\nthe Intermediate 1 category in 18:06.6.\nThe crew set off in 12th hot on the\nheels of the Durham first 8+ determined to take them doon, which they\nswiftly did. The club was hosting an\nalumni reception in the club room and\nafter the race strokeman Steele was\nreflective when speaking to the press\nofficer: \u201cThe stern three in that boat\u2026\nall freshers.\u201d *dramatic pause* \u201cThat\u2019s\npretty f-ing awesome. Give it two years\nand that\u2019s us right there.\u201d *points to\nvictorious Henley 2004 photo of Simon Hislop, George Whittaker, Hugh\nMackenzie, Ed Johnson & Seb Pearce*\nThanks to Imperial College London\nRector Sir Keith O\u2019Nions for attending\nthe reception and conducting a rather\nwet boat naming ceremony. Two new\nICBC St\u00e4mpflis were named; \u2018Martin\nKnight\u2019 after the College COO and \u2018Simon Archer\u2019 after Senior Lecturer and\nChair of the Boathouse management.\nA few weeks earlier the women\u2019s\nhead of the river saw ICBC\u2019s Mel Wilson, Lenny Kennedy and Ro Bradbury\nbecome Head of the River in a composite 8+ (Gloucester/IC/Marlow/Read-ing Uni./Thames/UL) at WEHORR.\nThey won by 20 seconds (18:10.67)\nover nearest rivals and hotly tipped\nLeander Club (18:30.39). The GB crew\nwas stroked by triple Olympic silver\nmedallist Katherine Grainger and have\nbeen training out of ICBC and coached\nby IC\u2019s Steve Trapmore in the run up\nto the Head. The Imperial club first\n8+ came 15th overall (19:31.16) while\nthe alumni composite came close-by in\n18th (19.34.9).\nA\ns we enter into the summer\nterm, the majority of the sports\nfixtures for this academic year\nhave been played. Although many will\nargue cricket and athletics seasons are\nonly just beginning, the number of results for these sports would not be as\ngreat as those sports which have com-petede over the previous two terms.\nfelixSport can reveal the final league\ntable for the 2009-2010 season. Standing at the summit of the table are Fencing Women\u2019s 1s and Volleyball Men\u2019s\n1s both of whom boast unblemished\nrecords and have won all of their\nmatches. Our female fencing team improved on their 4th place finish in the\ntable last year. Men\u2019s Volleyball team\nmanaged to outdo the performance of\ntheir female counterparts who finished\na promising 6th last year and improved\nto a 3rd place finish this time around.\nDavid Wilson\nT\nhursday night saw Fulham\nand Liverpool taking on\nHamburg and Athletico\nMadrid respectively in the\nsemi-finals of this year\u2019s\nUEFA Europa League. As felix goes\nto press on a Thursday evening I cannot write about the result, although it\nwouldn\u2019t be too optimistic to predict\nan all English final. Both teams are\nplaying at home, while Fulham enter\nthe game 0-0 on aggregate, Liverpool\nhave the harder albeit achievable task\nof overturning a one nil deficit from\nthe first leg in Madrid.\nThere is a strong chance that at\nleast one of the English teams will\nbe present in the May 12th final. An\nEnglish club has not competed in the\nEuropa League (formerly UEFA Cup)\nfinal since 2006 when Sevilla thrashed\nMiddlesbrough, who now play in the\nChampionship.\nWhile Fulham\u2019s achievement is notable and should be recognised, Liverpool\nshould not be contesting the Europa\nLeague. They are a team rich in history and last season finished second\nin the Premiership, this season their\ncampaign has been hit by injuries and\nindifferent form from key players. They\nwere dumped into the Europa League\nas a consequence of their limp performances in the group stage of this year\u2019s\nChampions League. Liverpool are not\nthe only English team to disappoint in\nEurope this year. Arsenal, Chelsea and\nManchester United were all eliminated\nat the Quarter Final stage of the Champion\u2019s League, destroying any dreams\nof another all English Final. The strong\npresence of English clubs in the later\nstages of the Champions league in recent years has disappeared; this will be\nthe first year that an English club has\nnot contested the final since 2004.\nThe reason, it would appear, is that\nother teams have caught up and have\ndevised tactics and strategies to beat\nthe English teams. Real Madrid spent\nover \u00a3200 million last summer, but even\nthis sum of money cannot buy success;\nresults only stem from a team performing together.\nBarcelona are the only team who\nhave prevented English dominance of\nEurope\u2019s premier competition in recent years with their tika-tak football.\nEven they were not worthy of a place\nin this year\u2019s final; knocked out by Jose\nMourinho\u2019s Inter in Tuesday\u2019s semi fi-nal. The other place in the final is occupied by Bayern Munich, the team\nwho ended Manchester United\u2019s run in\nthe competition. Both Inter and Bayern are teams which are rebuilding and\nreturning to prominence. Mourinho\u2019s\nstar performer is Wesley Sneijder who\nwas surplus to requirements at Real\nMadrid following the Galacticos II redevelopment scheme, while another\nReal reject, Arjen Robben sparks the\nBayern team into life when he\u2019s not on\nthe sidelines injured. European teams\nseem to be a more attractive option\nto top players with supposed interest\nfrom English teams in both Robben\nand Sneijder ignored.\nThere is no doubt that the Premier\nLeague has its fair share of World Class\nplayers, but it seems that \u2018the best\nleague in the World\u2019 has lost some of its\nallure. The poor weather is supposedly\nFranck Ribery\u2019s reason not to play in\nEngland. Could the reason be the high\ntaxes which hit the astronomic wage\nbills earned by top footballers. Andrey\nArshavin of Arsenal was left more than\na little annoyed when he found out\nthat Mr Brown takes away half of his\nreported \u00a380,000 wage packet.\nIt\u2019s not just in Europe that England\u2019s\ntop teams have struggled; the Premier\nLeague title race has been the closest it\nhas been for a while. While one could\nargue this increases entertainment, it\nwas still three familiar faces fighting it\nout for the title. Manchester United and\nArsenal only remained in the title race\ndue to Chelsea\u2019s ability to drop points.\nIt is encouraging that the gulf between\nfourth place and \u2018the rest\u2019 now appears\nto be closing or are the top four just not\nas good anymore? Only time will tell\nwhat is to become of the English game.\nBut for now, as the domestic season\ndraws to a close for another year let\u2019s\nlook forward to the World Cup which, if\npopular consensus counts for anything,\nwe are sure to win. Could it be that we\nall expect a bit too much?\nIs the English Premiership\nexperiencing a decline? Sports Editor\n\n"

I hope you had a\nrefreshing break or as so many of you were revising, your revision went well. It\u2019s back to the daily grind from now until the\nend of the academic year with the summer term punctuated\nby exams and projects.\nBut enough of that, what did we miss I hear you cry! Well the month of April\nheld a surprising amount of goings on in the consumer electronics space this\nyear, including a couple of things from Apple, a few tidbits from Microsoft and an\nabsolute deluge from Dell. So without pomp and circumstance, let\u2019s get on with\nit shall we? Roll the press!\niPhone\nW\nhilst the great majority of you\nwere hitting the books, Apple\nhas been quite busy. A week after\nthe iPad release the fruity company sent out\ninvites to an iPhone OS4 event titled \u2018Get a\nsneaky peak into the future of iPhone OS\u2019.\nNow of course, this wasn\u2019t really a surprise\nfor those keeping up, but what did strike\npeople in the know was that even though\nApple\u2019s mobile operating system is now\npowering three separate devices, the iPhone,\nthe iPod touch and the iPad, it\u2019s still called\niPhone OS. Still, Apple did its adoring fans\nproud with a show and release of the developer version of the OS.\nApple changed a lot of things in the\niPhone OS, most of them small or not user\naccessible, but here\u2019s what you need to know.\nFor all intents and purposes it\u2019s got\n\u2018multitasking\u2019. OK, in truth it\u2019s not real\nmultitasking, but on a device with a screen\nthat small, who\u2019s going to want to run two\nfull programs side-by-side, if just running\nthe important threads of the program can\ndo the job just fine? The dock has been\nmodified to allow rapid app switching\nbetween those running in the background\nand it\u2019s also gotten all 3D on us, just like the\nMac OS X dock you know and love. The\nspringboard now has Folders too, so you can\nbundle apps of your choosing into spring-loaded folders on your home pages. If you\u2019ve\never used Stacks on Mac OS X you\u2019ll know\nhow Folders work. iPhone mail has been\nupgraded with multiple Exchange profile\nsupport and a unified Inbox, plus you can\nnow have wallpapers on your home screen\nnot just lock screen. I bet you\u2019ve been longing\nfor that ever since you saw the iPhone right?\nMr. Jobs also unveiled iBooks for iPhone OS\nto bring it into line with the iPad, and like\niPhone OS4, the next evolution of Apple\u2019s mob\nApple iPad Launch\nW\nhilst you were out, Apple launched a little thing called the iPad. You\nmight have seen our feature on Mr. Job\u2019s \u2018magical\u2019 device last term,\nwhich was released in its WiFi only form to avid fans across the US\non April 3rd. Is it as amazing as all Apple fanboy\u2019s hoped and dreamed? Maybe.\nThe plethora of reviews have certainly been good, but unfortunately the\ninternational release of Apple\u2019s new market defining device has been pushed back\nto \u2018the end of May\u2019, with official pricing and availability due to be announced\non May 10th. So for the mean time, all I can tell you is what you can read for\nyourselves in the gazillion reviews that every Tom, Dick and Harry has rushed to\npublish. It\u2019s good, but it doesn\u2019t do everything you\u2019ve always wanted and we\u2019re not\nsure what you\u2019ll use it for. Apple put\u2019s this delay down to the iPad\u2019s unexpected\nsuccess in the US, with over one million estimated to have been sold since launch.\nOf course accessories for the slate device have been popping up left, right and\ncentre from every manufacturer. Some better than others, they range from basic\nstands to DIY keyboard cases that turn the iPad into a sudo-laptop.\nBut who\u2019s the iPad really for? Well this week there\u2019s been a story kicking\nabout the technology press of a woman who\u2019s been given back here passion for\nreadingby the iPad, becoming arguably the oldest early adopter ever. The 99 year\nold woman who\u2019s poor eye sight has prevented her from reading books, uses the\niPad\u2019s sizable and bright text to read again. The perfect computer for your mother\nthen perhaps?\nOh and for those who are interested, Blendtec confirmed it, the iPad will blend,\neven if you have to cheat a little bit to get it in the blender.\nBetter than\nEaster eggs\nW\nelcome back stran-gers, no need to\nhide away. I know\nit\u2019s a difficult time\nof year for quite a\nlot of you, exams and all, so this week\nI\u2019ve conjured up a brief \u2018I\u2019ve been hiding under a rock revising for a month,\nwhat happened\u2019 guide for you. Think\nof it as a little light relief from the tedium of study.\nActually, quite a lot has happened in\nthe weeks of college closure, a surprising amount really. We\u2019ve had a barrage\nof Apple news, which seems to be pretty much normal these days, but we\u2019ve\nalso seen Dell drop a mother load of\ndevices in one leak and Microsoft take\nits first foray into phone manufacture\nwith the Kin.\nThe Kin itself is quite interesting\nbecause unlike Apple, Palm or RIM,\nMicrosoft is an operating system seller,\nnot a device orientated company. OK,\nthe Kin isn\u2019t strictly part of Microsoft\u2019s\nWindows Phone series, but it\u2019s still a\nphone that Microsoft\u2019s selling themselves that could compete directly\nwith their licensee\u2019s phones. Google\nof course is doing the same thing with\ntheir Nexus One, but Google isn\u2019t selling the OS to its licensees as its open\nsource. You\u2019ve got to wonder what\ncompanies like HTC, Dell and Motorola think about operating system\nvendors selling their own hardware.\nPalm, a company struggling against\nAndroid and Apple, was put up for\nsale during the Easter break. The Pre\nand Pixie, although decent phones in\nthemselves, hadn\u2019t garnered the success needed to put the company back\ninto good financial standing. Although\nthe most likely suitor HTC ruled themselves out of a purchase, HP swooped\nin and bought Palm late on Wednesday\nnight this week for $1.2 billion. Let\u2019s\nhope that HP gets the company that\narguably started the smartphone revolution back on the winning track.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nM\nicrosoft, not to be left out of the party that was April, announced its\nfirst own-brand phones, the Kin One, a square slider and the Kin Two,\na more traditional landscape slider. Microsoft\u2019s aiming the Kin brand\nas a separate device category from the recently announced Windows Phone 7,\ntargeted at what Microsoft calls, \u2018Generation Upload\u2019, that\u2019s the youth of today\napparently. Essentially, the Kin phones are smart-dumbphones, or should that\nbe dumb-smartphones, either way, they\u2019ve got smartphone like features running\non a stripped out smartphone operating system that lacks critical features that\ndefine a true smartphone. There are no apps for the Kin; neither does the user\nhave to worry about multitasking or device management. But what the Kin does\nprovide is a streamlined way to get on the mobile web, life stream and connect\nwith friends. The Kin is the product of the Danger purchase that Microsoft made\na year or so ago and is the spiritual successor to the T-mobile SideKick.\nBoth Kin models feature social networking integration with direct pooling and\naccess to Facebook and Twitter built-in. The phone limits automatic updates of\nyour friend\u2019s statuses to every 15 minutes, which should allow the Kin to be sold\nwith cheaper data plans. Limiting network access has also allowed Microsoft to\ngive the Kin devices \u2018weekend battery-life\u2019. Not as impressive as the standard cheap\ndumbphone week-long battery life, but certainly a lot better than the standard\nbarely-a-day\u2019s usage you get out of the current generation of smartphones.\nIf either Kin pushes your buttons, look for them on Vodafone in the Autumn.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Kin One (right) and Kin Two (left) for \u2018Generation Upload\u2019\nMicrosoft Kin\nApple\u2019s iPad, available end of May 2010 in the UK\n\n"

    "content": "14 felix FRIDAY 30 APRIL 2010\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor\nBusiness Editor Sina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhe Conservatives\u2019 recently\ndiminished lead may not\nbe enough to overcome\nLabour\u2019s advantages in\nthe current electoral sys-tem. A key swing vote in recent elections has been that of small business\nowners. In 2010 they are a particularly\nimportant constituency because of the\nlikely closeness of the race. The Economist reported last week that \u201cabout\n6,000 voters in each constituency are\nsole traders or own small businesses.\u201d\nIn marginal seats, that can make all the\ndifference.\nLabour will need to recoup ground lost\nwith these voters by their proposed increase in national insurance tax. It is predicted to raise \u00a36 billion for The Treasury, but the Federation of Small Business\npredicts it will destroy 57,000 jobs.\nIt came as little surprise then, that\nShadow Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s\npromise last month to ditch the hike\nwas warmly greeted by business lead-ers. In fact, 23 heads of major UK com-panies, later joined by another 45, had\nalready written to the Daily Mail asking the Government to reconsider.\nThe Tories will still keep the tax\nhike for those earning above a certain threshold. This limits the appeal\nof their counter-proposal. But at least\nthey avoided patronising business\nleaders as Gordon Brown did two\nweeks ago by asserting that if only they\nunderstood national insurance tax,\nthey would support the hike. Labour\nhas however won some support by offering to cut business rates (a tax on\npremises) for some businesses as part\nof the 2011 budget.\n\u201c...none of this\nhappened by\naccident. It\nwas because\nof deliberate\nchoices made\nby this Labour\nGovernment\u201cAlistair Darling\nWith voters likely to take strong\nanti-political feelings into the polls\nwith them on May 6th, Labour has\nbeen struggling to use its incumbency to its advantage on the experience\nargument.\nIt has been trying to argue that since\nit has greater recent executive expe-rience, it is better suited to pull the\ncountry out of its current economic\nsituation.\nIn a speech in Edinburgh last\nWednesday, Chancellor Alistair Darling tried that narrative for one last\ntime before Election Day. He started\nby painting the scene, talking of \u201cthe\ndeepest recession for over 60 years.\u201d\nThen came the expected importance\nof experience pitch, \u201cGordon and I\nmade, the decisions taken, would have\na direct impact on businesses, on fami-lies, on jobs and incomes. Get them\nright and we had the chance of stopping the economy, here at home and\ninternationally, sliding to disaster. Get\nthem wrong and the cost would be\npaid by businesses and families right\nacross our country.\u201d\nNot one to leave his audience on a\ncliff-hanger, they were soon told how\nit all ended: \u201cI was right.\u201d Mr Darling\nput almost every major debate in modern political economy to rest, declaring that he had been proven right by\n\u201cthe record.\u201d He accused the Tories of\nbeing motivated by \u201cideology,\u201d holding\n\u201cembarrassing\u201d views and advocating\n\u201cpolicies which will put at risk the recovery the country has worked so hard\nto deliver. Policies which will threaten\nyour job, your living standards and the\npublic services on which millions of\nfamilies depend.\u201d\nBut some of his comments will prove\nless controversial, claiming, \u201cnone of\nthis happened by accident. It was because of deliberate choices made by\nthis Labour Government.\u201d You would\nnot have known it, but he was \u2013 with\na perfectly straight face \u2013 referring to\nthe strength of the Labour economy.\nThe Conservatives\u2019 Big Idea for this\nelection has come to be what they call\nthe \u201cBig Society.\u201d It is difficult to know\nwhat to make of it, for several reasons.\nFirstly, it is odd that they are taking such a risk by trying to introduce\nvoters to unusual thinking when they\nhave a clear lead in the polls. Also, this\nseems a distinctively un-Conservative\nvision. The Big Society idea comes\nafter years of internal disputes over\ncore philosophy, and seems aimed at\nthe contemporary middle classes \u2013 a\nfirmly Statist demographic according\nto polls, unlike say twenty years ago.\nSome of the more bizzare parts of\nthe Tories\u2019 Big Society include using\n\u201cthe latest insights from behavioural\neconomics to encourage people to donate more time and money to charity\u201d\nand setting up a \u201cBig Society Bank\u201d and\ncelebrating \u201cBig Society Day.\u201d But most\nof this plan is about the State taxing\ncitizens, but then letting charities and\n\u201csocial enterprises\u201d spend the money.\nThere are two main reasons offered\nagainst State interference in general:\nthe motivations of the interfering bureaucrat and the impossibility of rational decision making in the absence\nof price information. The Big Society\nmay be interpreted as the Tories understanding the former point but still\nbeing unconvinced of the latter.\nBig Society\nWhat\u2019s next for Britain\u2019s economy?\nIn felix\u2019s last business section before the Election, the Parties\u2019 economic and business policies are reviewed\nThe Business Vote\nAt a glance - comparing the three major political parties\nLabour\n- Increase income tax to 50% on earnings over \u00a3150,000\n- Pledge not to increase income tax\n- One-off tax on bankers\u2019 bonuses\n- Work internationally to introduce a \u201cglobal levy\u201d on financial services\n- Break up banks in which the Government currently has a controlling stake\n- Set up a fund to channel \u00a34bn of public and private investment into firms\n- Raise threshold of support for company takeovers to two-thirds of shareholders\nConservatives\n- Raise Inheritance Tax threshold to \u00a31m\n- Scrap Labour\u2019s planned 1% national insurance rise for people earning less than \u00a335,000\n- Scrap Stamp Duty for first-time buyers on homes up to \u00a3250,000\n- Two-year council tax freeze\n- Freeze public sector pay for one year in 2011\nLiberal Democrats\n- Raise the threshold income at which people start paying income tax to \u00a310,000 per year\n- Impose \u201cmansion tax\u201d on the value of properties over \u00a32m\n- Increase capital gains tax to bring it into line with income tax\n- Set a \u00a3400 pay rise cap for all public sector workers\n- Introduce a banking levy until banks\u2019 retail and investment arms are separated\n- Limit the length of \u201cnon-domiciled\u201d status to seven years\n- Force regulators to consider the \u201cpublic interest\u201d when assessing takeover bids\nBrown, Clegg (above) and Cameron (below) are going head-to-head\n\n"

This year\u2019s competition also\nsaw the first year of allowing video entries into the competition, which also\nshowed a large amount of enthusiasm\nand effort put into science-related\nmedia.\nThe Science Challenge Grand Final\nwas held at the Institute of Directors on\nPall Mall and was a very formal affair.\nWith a reception and dinner attended\nby Imperial students, the winners and\nrunners up from the schools competition and the prestigious list of judges\nfrom the competition, comprising of\nSir Keith O\u2019Nions, Rector of Imperial\nCollege, Mark Henderson, Science Editor of the Times, and Athene Donald\nFRS, UNESCO 2009 Woman Scientist\nof the Year, a distinguished physicist at\nthe University of Cambridge. Despite\nAndrew Harrison, Fuel Innovations\nManager at Shell, having put forward\na question for the competition, he\nwas unable to attend the presentation\nevening, and so another representative from Shell took his place, as Shell\nwere the main sponsor of the event and\nhelped to provide some of the prizes.\nAlongside the judges, guest speaker\nSimon Singh was present at the din-ner, and gave a very entertaining yet\nthought-provoking speech about his\ncurrent libel case. He spoke about\nthe importance of science being communicated to the public, and gave an\nexample of a scientific inaccuracy in a\nKatie Melua song which he corrected\nand re-recorded with her. He also\nspoke about his views on libel reform,\nwhich he is (not surprisingly) very passionate about, and encouraged future\nscience writers to campaign alongside\nhim to change UK libel law.

The Suunto Fitness solution\nworks by simply strapping a belt across\nyour chest and as you enter the gym or\nstudio and start exercising an electromagnetic signal is sent to the Suunto\nPOD receiver and your heart rate will\nbe displayed on the screen or projector.\nOnce you have got your heart rate\nmonitor belt it can only be beneficial\nto you if you understand the heart rate\nreadings you get when you are exercising and also knowing what the limits\nare. With the Suunto solution this is all\ndone for you. The Suunto system calculates your Heart Rate Zones and also\ncalculates your Training Effect.\nMaking sure you are exercising in the\ncorrect Heart Rate Zones will improve\nyour progression at that particular intensity and enable you to achieve maximal results. It is also a good way of\nkeeping you on track and maintaining\nmotivation to keep up your aerobic exercise sessions.

The early morning showers\nhad just about disappeared ready for\nan exciting game of cricket. Reading\nwon the toss and elected to field.\nImperial\u2019s openers Matt Tarr (73)\nand James Musgrave (78) attacked the\nnew ball to bring up a stylish and rapid\ncentury partnership in just 14 overs; a\ndream start. Both Tarr and Musgrave\npunished any poorly bowled balls with\nTarr hitting three sixes; one of which\nlanded outside the ground on a nearby\nroad.\nHowever, poor concentration was to\nlead to the downfall of both batsman as\nthey spooned catches in the off side. A\nsimilar story was to follow for most of\nthe Imperial batters.\nAfter a couple of quick wickets and\na slight dip in run rate, Ankit Patel\n(40) hung around producing a watchful innings, while short cameos at the\nother end brought Imperial up to a\ngood total of 280. Imran Zahid (26) in\nparticular dispatched several balls out\nof the park, including one monster six\ndown the ground. From 256-5 in 44\novers IC felt that they could have done\nbetter but were happy with the score\nnonetheless.\nNavin Surtani and Andrew Payne\nopened the bowling for Imperial and\nonce again gave the team a great start\nto the innings. Surtani, in particular,\nwas bowling a perfect line and length\nwith a brilliant balance of seam and\nswing; any opening batsman\u2019s night-mare. In contrast Payne utilised a\ncompletely different style who, with\nhis height was able to exploit some of\nthe demons in the pitch; one delivery\nbounced off a length and shaved the\nbatsman\u2019s head as it raced through to\nthe keeper.\nPressure was building which ultimately caused the initial wickets, one\neach for Surtani (1-16) and Payne (1-47), courtesy of a well judged caught-and-bowled. Wonderboy Rehan Ali\ngot the wicket of the day with a hidden\nbouncer that completely deceived the\nReading no. 4.\nIt looked like Imperial were on the\nhome stretch at the drinks break with\nthe score on 70-5 after 25 overs, but\nReading had other ideas. Number 6\n(Grindal) and 7 (Waterstone) were\npicking off the bad balls after the break,\nsteadily accumulating runs while Imperial kept looking for the next wicket.\nJoe O\u2019Gorman used the pitch to his\nadvantage with some leg-spin, but the\nodd loose ball kept the runs ticking\nover. Eventually O\u2019Gorman snuck one\nthrough and bowled Waterstone to get\nthe 6th wicket.\nGrindal kept going though, now\nstarting to accelerate with several\nmammoth sixes and a punishing attitude to anything slightly off line or\nlength, working his way to a century.\nSteady wickets at the other end kept\nthe pressure on, but you could sense\nthe game had become close with on-field tension increasing every over.\nPressure on the fielders led to a couple\nof difficult chances going down and\nsome misfields on the boundary.\nEhtasham Junaid bowled well from\none end to keep it tight, but at the other end Patel kept leaking runs.\nUmpires began questioning the\nover-rate and with Imperial were rushing through their overs, the score at\n268-9 after 48 overs and Grindal was\non strike: 13 runs required from 12\nballs. The first ball of the 48th over was\nshort; Grindal went for the pull, looking for the gap at the deep square leg\nI\nIm\nImpe\npe i\nri\nri l\nal\nal C\nC\nC l\nol\noll\nle\nlege\nge M\nM\nMen\nen\u2019\n\u2019s\ns 1\n1 t\nst\nst X\nX\nXI\nI\nI 8\n28\n280\n0 Al\nAl\nAll\nl\nl\nout\nUniversity of Reading 2nd XI 268 All\nout\nImperial won by 12 runs\nAndrew Payne Cricket\nI\nIm\nImpe\npe i\nri\nri l\nal\nal C\nC\nC l\nol\noll\nle\nlege\nge M\nM\nMen\nen\u2019s\ns 2\n2 d\nnd\nnd X\nX\nXI\nI\nI 14\n147\n7 Al\nAl\nAll\nl\nl\nout\nUniversity of Brighton 2nd XI 148 for\ntwo\nImperial lost by 8 wickets\nImperial cricketers begin their season with two promising performances\nEffect.\nZone 60 \u2013 70% helps develop basic\nendurance and aerobic capacity. It can\nalso help you lose weight by fat burning which is when your fat provides\nsome of the total energy you need to\nkeep going. This is most beneficial\nwhen exercising for a duration of 40\nminutes plus. The longer you exercise\nat this intensity the more fat you will\nuse up for energy. If the intensity of exercise is increased then the fat contribution will decrease.\nZone 70 \u2013 80% will help develop\nyour cardiovascular system. This is\nthe body\u2019s ability to transport oxygen\nto the working muscles and transport\ncarbon dioxide away from the working\nmuscles. As you get fitter you will improve your aerobic capacity.\nZone 80 \u2013 90% will help to develop\nyour lactic acid system and find out\nyour anaerobic threshold. During this\nzone the amount of fat being used as\nenergy is greatly reduced and the glycogen stored in your muscles is used.\nOne of the waste products of burning\nglycogen is lactic acid which builds up\nin the working muscles.\nYour anaerobic threshold is the point\nwhere your body cannot remove lactic acid from the working muscles\nquickly enough. There is only a certain amount of lactic acid, which the\nmuscles can tolerate before fatigue and\nsoreness sets in and the exercise must\nbe stopped. You can delay the onset of\nfatigue through correct training of the\nlactic acid system and you may be able\nto increase your tolerance to lactic acid\nbuild-up.\nZone 90 \u2013 100% is only possible for\nshort periods of time and can help to\ndevelop speed by training your fast\ntwitch muscle fibres.\nOnly the very fit are able to train\neffectively within this zone. It is recommended you seek advice about the\ncorrect way to train in this zone due\nto the risks associated with high heart\nrates.\nWhen you are complete your workout and you take your belt off, the system creates a summery of your workout including energy consumption and\nyour Training effect results.\nMaking sure you are achieving the\ncorrect Training Effect will improve\nyour progression and help you achieve\nyour exercise goals. It will help keep\nyou on track and maintain your motivation during exercise sessions. This is\nall done using the Suunto Fitness Solution so you no longer have to worry\nabout whether your are doing enough\nin your training sessions and if your\ncurrent exercise sessions have actually\nbeen making a difference to you. You\nshould also now have an idea of what\nintensity you should be training at for\ncertain results.\nNext time you are in the Energia gym\nspeak to one of the personal trainers\nand get yourself a belt for the special\nprice of \u00a320.\nboundary, but instead he top edged it\nstraight back to the bowler, handing\nImperial a tense victory.\nThe players, although shocked at\nhow close the game had become,\nshowed fantastic sportsmanlike beah-viour in commiserated Grindal (132)\non his brilliant innings.\nThe team knew that the game should\nnever have been allowed to get as close\nas it did and that improvements are\nrequired throughout the forthcoming\nseason.\n***\nAfter an unusually prompt meet by a\nscratched together 2nd XI, everyone\nset out for a \u2018home\u2019 game at Harlington. However, after deciding that the\nteam was lacking a bit of communal\nspirit, captaincy debutant Pete Swallow decided to take the scenic route in\nand around Heathrow (not helped by\nbeing told to get the wrong bus).\nFortunately everyone arrived on\ntime and a new team spirit had been\nformed by gently abusing the Captain.\nBrighton won the toss and decided\nthey would field first giving most of\nthe team time to sit down and chill\nout. The makeshift opening pair of\nSandeep Saha and new-boy Alex Tindale (40) started slowly and Sandeep\nwas soon out.\nThe second new player Raj S and\nAlex then developed a good partnership and runs started to flow until a\nhorrendous mix-up lead to Raj being run out. Wickets then were lost at\nregular intervals until Rohan Babla and\nAhsen Khan (20) came in and, to the\nsurprise of everyone, took the attack\nto the rather pathetic spinner put on\nto bowl with Rohan (33), who\u2019d probably not hit a ball in any of the training\nsessions, hitting two rather impressive\n6s that he will not forget (and won\u2019t let\nanyone who talks to him forget either).\nImperial ended up on 147 all out.\nBuoyed by a good finish to their\ninnings, IC set out to field with\nconfidence.\nPete decided to take responsibility\nand started off with a fast and hostile\nopening over, taking a wicket with the\n3rd ball; guided to an expertly placed\nAlex in the slips. Rajiv Bhar, the other\nopening bowler, was unlucky to not\nget a wicket as he had several chances\ndropped, something that plagued the\nteam and was ultimately responsible\nfor the loss as Brighton managed to\nget the 148 required for the loss of only\none more wicket.\nOverall, the team performance was\ngood within which there was a lot of\nenthusiasm and effort while many\npositives can be taken from the game\nas we look to improve over the forthcoming season.\nFinal congratulations to Alex Tindale\nfor his man of the match performance for scoring 40 runs and taking 2\ncatches.\n\n"

The image shows a\nsmall part of one of the main regions of\nstar birth in our galaxy. The section of\nthe nebula pictured stands three light\nyears tall and is set to become one of\nHubble\u2019s more influential images, placing it alongside the \u2018Pillars of Creation\u2019\nin the Eagle nebula imaged by the telescope in 1995. To date Hubble\u2019s mission of discovery has seen it aim itself\ntowards 30,000 celestial objects and\nproduce over half a million images for\nits archive.\nThe history of Hubble however is\nakin to the proverbial roll- er-coaster. Launched in 1990\naboard the space shuttle Discovery, it was a\nmatter of weeks before\nthe first in a line of\nproblems for the\ntelescope realised itself.\nAn error in the\nshape of Hubble\u2019s\nprimary mirror to\nthe order a fiftieth of\nthe width of a human\nhair produced an effect\nknown as spherical aberra-tion. This spherical aberration\ncaused significant image blurring and\nhad to be corrected in 1993 during the\nfirst of five servicing missions to the\ntelescope so far. In 1994 the entire apparatus was shut down due to the failure of four out of six gyroscopes which\nallow Hubble to aim and 2003 saw the\nspace shuttle Columbia (one in a fleet\nof shuttles which carried out servicing\non the telescope) break up upon reentry through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nAs a result, future servicing missions\nwere cancelled; being viewed as too\nrisky with the aging shuttle fleet. Even\nbefore its launch, the HST caused\ncontroversy. Robert O\u2019Dell, founding project scientist explained many\nastronomers at the time thought it\nbetter to build 20 larger ground based\nscopes than have one less powerful\norbiting telescope, despite the\nimage clarity Hubble would\nbe able to provide as a result of being positioned\noutside the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere.\nRegardless of\nthese and various other blips\nin Hubble\u2019s\nhistory, the\nproject has\nbeen largely successful at increasing\nour understanding of the\nuniverse and has revolutionised modern astronomy.\nOne of the main aims of Hubble\nO\nn the 15th\nof April Simon\nSingh, science writer\nand Imperial alum-nus, received the long\noverdue news that the\nBritish Chiropractic Association were\nbringing to an end the libel case they\nhad brought against him. His crime?\nWriting an article, originally published\nin the Guardian in 2008 and now back\nonline, which questioned claims made\nby chiropractors.\nChiropractors claim to treat illnesses by manipulating the spine and\nneck. In his article, Singh criticised\nchiropractors, and the British Chiropractic Association (BCA), for saying\nthey could treat childhood conditions\nsuch as colic, asthma and ear infec-tions, despite there being \u201cnot a jot of\nevidence\u201d. He also discussed the use of\nchiropractic techniques in curing back\nand neck problems, and the dangers\ninvolved. He cited the high incidence\nof adverse side effects and even fatalities associated with them in addition\nto the relative low rates of success. He\nhad recently published a book on the\ntopic with a former chiropractor, so\nshould have been considered to be in a\ngood position to criticise the BCA. In\nhis article, he referred to their claims\nas \u201cbogus\u201d, backing this up with references to studies and statistics. However, despite these credentials and the\nscientific basis of the article, the BCA\nlaunched a libel case against Singh, citing the damage he had caused to their\nreputation.\nIn May 2009 it was ruled that the\nwording of Singh\u2019s article implied the\nBCA were being knowingly dishonest.\nHaving launched an appeal, on the 1st\nof April this year the Court of Appeal\nruled that his article counted as com-ment, not fact, so he could use the fair\ncomment defence. If this hadn\u2019t been\nthe case, it would have had great implications for others questioning the\nclaims of companies and organisations.\nA precedent could have been set, making many more scientists and science\njournalists vulnerable to financially\nand emotionally draining libel cases.\nAlthough this case has cost Singh\ndearly, both in terms of the time it has\ntaken up and the amount it has cost\nhim personally (two years and over\n\u00a3100,000), some good has come from\nit. Over 50,000 people have now signed\na petition asking for libel reform, and\nthe issues surrounding libel law in this\ncountry have been brought to the forefront of discussion. Current British\nlibel laws consider a defendant guilty\nuntil proven innocent, in direct op-Libel case against Simon Singh dropped\nT\nhe recent spotlight on several libel cases\nbrought against scientists has generated\npressure for libel reform. In light of the\nincreased number of such cases and\nbearing in mind Imperial conducts research which\nmay call to question the actions of others, Imperial\nCollege Union is submitting a paper to Council\nregarding the action the Union should take in\nresponse to the demand for libel reform.\nThe paper, available through the Union website,\nwas proposed by the president and outlines the\nUnion\u2019s view on the current state of UK libel laws,\ntheir possible effect on students of the college and the\naction the Union is proposing to take. In particular\nthe paper notes the libel cases brought against Simon\nSingh and Ben Goldacre (The Guardian\u2019s \u2018Bad Science\u2019\ncolumnist) and also expresses concern that \u2018[current\nlibel law] has a chilling effect on scientific debate\u2019 and\nthe costs involved for anyone defending their wok in a\nlibel case. The Union even feels some students may fall\nfoul of these laws due to publications released from\nresearch courses they are on.\nThe Union proposes action be taken including\nthe lobbying for the support of MPs and College to\nsupport libel reform and making students more aware\nof the issues surrounding UK libel law.\nCloser to home\nposition to the rest of the legal system.\nCases can be long and costly, as Singh\u2019s\nwas, and incredibly difficult to win.\nThere are few alternatives to a full trial.\nThe laws don\u2019t appear to have moved\nwith the times, either, and do not reflect the presence of the Internet as a\nsource of comment and discussion. In\naddition, there is the phenomenon of\n\u201clibel tourism\u201d - where foreign defendants use British libel laws to silence\nthose who criticise them.\nIt is important to remember that\nthe case was won not through libel\nreform, but in spite of the libel laws\nstill in place, which Singh described\nin his statement on the Libel Reform\nCampaign website as \u201cthe most notoriously anti-free speech libel laws in\nthe free world\u201d. Currently, the system\nalmost encourages cases such as the\none brought against Singh, and thus\ndiscourages free speech and stifles sci-ence, which is by its nature a system\ndependent on criticism. This is why,\ndespite this victory, a great deal still\nneeds to be done before we can say\nthat our legal system truly allows free\nspeech.\nFor more information visit\nwww.libelreform.org.\nat the time of its launch was to accurately measure the age of the universe.\nNot only did it achieve this but Hubble\nhas also collected data for investigating galaxy formation and found evidence supporting the existence of dark\nmatter, dark energy, black holes within\ngalaxies and exoplanets \u2013 before, other planets orbiting other stars were a\npurely theoretical idea.\n175,000\nmph\nThe speed at which Hubble\norbits above the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere.\nThe HST was named after astronomer Edwin Hubble who in the 1920\u2019s\ninvestigated the motion of galaxies\nleading to the conclusion of an expanding universe.

    "content": "21\nfelix FRIDAY 30 APRIL 2010\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk FILM\nW\narwick Thornton\nhas sprung out of\nnowhere to become the new darling of the world of\nindependent film. With a bag full of\nawards from his native Australia and\na film short-listed for the Oscars, he\nlooks set to become a prominent director of this century. Samson and Delilah has created debate in his homeland\nand highlighted problems that politicians probably want to pretend don\u2019t\nexist. He casually enters the room,\nwhere a small group of journalists have\ngathered. \u201cOkay, how are we going to\nchange the World guys?\u201d He quips,\nrunning his hands through a shaggy\nmane of hair, \u201cDid anyone bring a potato salad?\u201d. The room laughs nervous-ly, everyone knows that the questions\nthe film raises have no room for light\nhearted humour.\nI could have been a\ncontender!\n\u201cHave you changed the World for\nthe Aborigine community with your\nfilm?\u201d Someone quickly replies. Warwick gazes contemplatively for a few\nseconds,\n\u201cYeah I dunno, its a film full of questions not answers. It was on purpose to\nyou know that\u2019s the beauty of World\nCinema, some of the most beautiful\nfilms have really made me a better human being. Films from Outer Mongolia and London, you embrace them and\nyou can use those films to become a\nbetter human being essentially.\u201d Warwick speaks inarticulately, he appears\nto be a true filmmaker - letting the film\nspeak for him instead of words. It is obvious that there is no pretentious motivation behind Samson and Delilah.\n\u201cWere you sad not to make it into\nthe final five [of the Oscar Best Foreign\nFilm category]?\u201d\n\u201cOh totally. I have to be truthful, you\nmake your first film and then you\u2019re up\nfor up for contention for an Oscar and\nit\u2019s had such a beautiful run whether\nwe got in or not. A lot of people have\nseen the film and liked it but that\nwould have been the absolute icing on\nthe cake wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d We receive the\nobvious answer.\nA little more\nconversation?\nWith questions on the film\u2019s success\nexhausted, another person asks about\nfilms content itself. \u201cThere is not much\ndialogue between the characters. How\ndid the story turn out, was that due to\ntheir performances?\u201d\n\u201cMassive amount, you know what\nI mean. It\u2019s still a ninety page script,\neven though it didn\u2019t have much dialogue so every little nuance, every little look, every step is written into the\nactual script and so it was a lot more\ndemanding on them in that respect. I\ncouldn\u2019t use words like \u2018Im happy, I\u2019m\nsad, I\u2019m angry\u2019 like we do a lot in cinema to get narrative plots across. They\nactually had to act angry, sad, happy\nwhich was incredibly demanding on\nthe two kids.\u201d\n\u201cHad they acted before?\u201d\nAn Interview with Warwick Thornton\n\u201cNo, first film they\u2019d ever done\u201d\n\u201cHow did you go about working with\nthem in terms of drawing out their\nperformances?\u201d\n\u201cYou can teach. If their mind is open\nenough you can teach anybody to act,\nyou know to find that character you\nneed. The first step is to draw along your\nown personal experiences and emotions.\nThat\u2019s the stuff you want to do on set\nwhen you\u2019re making the film. With Rowan; he actually is a cheeky, wiry little mad\nkid, so he kinda owns a bit of Samson it\nthat respect. Marissa in real life is this\nabsolute Mother Earth, nurturing type\nof being and that\u2019s what I was looking\nfor when casting the film. All I had to do\nafter that, was make them feel incredibly\npositive about who they are as Rowan\nand Marissa, not Samson and Delilah. So\nthat when they did stand in front of the\ncamera, they had the energy and respect\nfor themselves and they could play any\ncharacter.\u201d When Warwick talks about\nthe children, you can almost see the\npride shining from his face.\nAustralia, it\u2019s not\nall about barbies\non the beach.\nI was now interested in what experiences the film had emerged from.\n\u201cWas the film based on any of your\npersonal experiences?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYeh I grew up in that town, in Alice\nSprings and I left school when I was\nthirteen and I spent a lot of time at\nnight on the streets. There is nothing\nin Samson and Delilah I haven\u2019t seen\npersonally in the town. I made sure\nthat I didn\u2019t write anything I hadn\u2019t\nseen in that sense, so that no one could\ntell me that this film isn\u2019t true.\n\u201cSo is solvent abuse quite a big problem?\u201d I press on.\n\u201cIt was, its not that bad anymore.\nFilm Editor Ed Knock meets the new director who is causing ripples of excitement across the Film World\nWe\u2019ve changed from lead-based petrol to the one that if you try and sniff\nit, gives you a really bad headache.\nThere\u2019s a darker side to that now too,\npeople are bringing in lead-based petrol and selling them for about 10 dollars a litre to kids, like drug dealers in\na sense.\nWhen Delilah is beaten for her\ngrandmothers death, is that something\nthat goes on?\n\u201cYeh that scene I\u2019m kinda talking to\nmy own mum about. There\u2019s parts of\nindigenous law and culture in Central\nAustralia which I think maybe aren\u2019t\nrelevant today. In precolonial times,\nyounger kids were not given but connected to ailing older elders. Their\njob was to look after them because\nthey get to that point where they can\u2019t\nhunt. The elder would transfer all the\nknowledge, songs and all the secret\nlaws to that child. That\u2019s the traditional\nway and it still happens today as you\ncan see when Delilah paints with her\ngrandmother and learns the traditional\nsongs. But if you didn\u2019t look after that\nelder person and she died you received\na beating, that was the traditional way\n\u201cHow did you find Marissa and Rowan, did you go out looking for nonprofessional actors?\u201d\nAgain, Warwick talks about his talent cast with a sense of endearment.\n\u201cYeh, I wrote the film knowing I would\nbe looking in communities around\nCentral Australia for these two kids. I\nneeded back up, I needed two kids who\nhad experienced the type of story that\nSamson and Deliah go through. They\nwere both thirteen when we made the\nfilm and it\u2019s thirteen years of research\nand rehearsal for the part; they had a\ntotal understanding when reading the\nscript of what was going on.\u201d\nAn unpleasant date\nwith the hairdresser\nWe ask after what the children are\ndoing now. \u201cThey\u2019re both sixteen,\nthey\u2019re teenagers - I dunno what the\nfuck they\u2019re doing.\u201d He explains in a\ndeadpan manner. He elaborates fur-ther, Marissa is set on attending university and is learning Japanese, however Rowan is still getting into trouble,\nunsure what to do with his life. Warwick assures us though that they will\nbe supported in anything they want to\ndo .\n\u201cHow did you persuade that poor little girl to make herself ugly?\u201d Someone\ncheekily inquires.\n\u201cRight from the beginning I said\nMarissa, we\u2019re gonna have to cut your\nhair off and give you black eyes. She\nhad incredibly beautiful hair but right\nfrom the beginning she was like \u201cOkay,\nI don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to be the star of\nthis movie.\u201d Before the scene she asked\ndo I really have to cut my hair off. We\nsaid yep, and we\u2019re going to cut it really\nbad and you\u2019re going to look terrible.\nShe understood that you traditionally\ncut your hair off when you\u2019re grieving.\nWe compromised and gave her a \u2018Posh\nSpice\u2019 hair cut but she understood the\nprocess of the journey for Delilah and\nthat it needed to be done properly.\nSamson and Delilah shares aesthetics and subjects similar to previous\nAustralian films such as Walkabout\nand The Proposition and I was interested to hear where Warwick had taken\nhis inspiration from.\n\u201cWalkabout is way before my time,\nI\u2019ve never been much of a cinema goer\nin a sense (\u2018in a sense\u2019 appears to be his\ncatchphrase\u2019). I watched Walkabout\nwhen I was twenty five; I never watched\nit again so it\u2019s not like I know it back to\nfront. I take inspiration from all over the\nshop, Terrence Malick for example.\nThe interview soon draws to a close.\nAlong the way we had a small discussion about Australian politics, which\nI felt wasn\u2019t necessary for inclusion in\nthe interview (as did Warwick). Samson and Delilah is a provocative film\nbut it is a very personal one for Warwick, and I have learned that it wasn\u2019t\na piece of exploitation cinema to put\nhimself in the spotlight. He is a promising director with a bold vision and\nunique style. If Samson and Delilah\nwas his warm-up act, I can\u2019t imagine\nhow great the future films he will produce are going to be.\ndo that. I don\u2019t have answers, by creating questions someone might have an\nanswer. Its a step forward.\u201d His heavy\nAussie drawl carries an air of honesty.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the response been from the\ncommunity?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of shock, but everybody loves the film in that sense. It\u2019s\na hard film, a dark film but people kinda go: if that\u2019s the way it is, it\u2019s fantastic\nto have that door opened, to see it and\nthink about it.\u201d It\u2019s apparent that he\nfeels a little uncomfortable becoming\na new campaigner for the Aborigines.\n\u201cHow surprised have you been by the\ninternational reaction?\u201d Someone else\ninquires.\n\u201cVery, very surprised. We were very\nproud of the film when we finished it,\nactually having it screened, this is what\nwe set out to do. Every screening has\nbeen really positive and people seem\nto write really beautiful things about it\u201d\n\u201cAre planning on taking the film to\nthe States?\u201d\n\u201cA limited release, the last place to\nbuy it was North America. I don\u2019t\nknow if it sold because it got into the\nfinals of the Oscars. We\u2019re in negotiations about that kinda stuff at the mo-ment. It would be great to show them,\n\u201cEvery screening\nhas been really\npositive and people\nseem to write really\nbeautiful things\nabout [the film]\u201d\n\u201cWhen Warwick\ntalks about the\nchildren, you can\nalmost see the\npride shining from\nhis face.\u201d\nand still happens today. Delilah did\nlook after her grandmother very well\nand she still got a beating and that\u2019s a\ntragedy and travesty in the film. Is this\nstill right? Is this still current to who\nwe are today?\u201d\n\n"

Finishing 160th overall in\nthe race with a speedy time of 2:39:26,\n20-year-old, Alex was the fastest\nBUCS-registered runner to complete\nthe 26 miles.\nfelixSport caught up with him to find\nout more about his success, and what\ngoes into running a marathon.\nIt turns out that last week\u2019s success\nstemmed from a tragic accident three\nyears ago: \u201cIn 2007 a good friend of\nmine broke his neck on a trampoline\nand since then has been paralyzed\nfrom the neck down. I wanted to help\nJack out and decided that running the\nmarathon for him would be a great way\nto do so. I began training later that year\nwith just a few runs here and there. I\ngot a place in the 2008 London Marathon through the Spinal Injuries Association and managed to raise \u00a34000\nfor them and \u00a36000 for my friend Jack.\nThe run was lots of fun and I was one\nof the youngest runners (18 was the\nminimum age). I finished in an OK 3\nhours 30 minutes.\u201d\nThis initial performance encouraged\nAlex to take running more seriously\nand join a club. He gradually built\nup to the 2009 marathon, winning a\nplace through the ballot and aiming\nfor a sub-three-hour time. He finished\nin a \u201cvery disappointing\u201d 3 hours 22\nminutes.\nThis year\u2019s marathon, then, was a\nchance for improvement. \u201cAfter running really badly in the London Marathon last year, I wanted to do it properly this time. This meant training\nharder and I have currently run every\nsingle day since 22nd\nMay 2009.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve run over a thousand miles since\nthe beginning of 2010 and my highest\nmileage week (102) was 4 weeks before the marathon. The most important part of my training was the long\nrun, which I gradually increased until\nrunning the furthest of 24 miles. The\nruns around Hyde Park with the Cross\nCountry Club on Wednesday are the\nmost fun as they are with a big group.\u201d\nSuch grueling training could only\npay off: \u201cI was feeling really good up\nuntil 18 miles. I had stuck to the pace I\nwanted and the noise from the crowds\nwas incredible.\u201d But a marathon is\nnever plain sailing, and Alex had to dig\nvery deep into his physical and mental resources to keep going during the\nrace: \u201cMy legs started to feel heavier\nand the proper pain started at mile 20.\nIt got worse and worse, but I forced\nmyself not to stop. By the 26th\nmile I\nwas completely disorientated and felt\non the verge of passing out. Luckily I\nmade it over the finish line still standing and then collapsed!\u201d\nIt was done, though. After a year\u2019s\nhard training, he had crossed the finish\nline \u2013 although realizing what he had\ndone took a while to sink in as he recovered from his effort in the first aid\ntent. He is, however, delighted with the\nresult : \u201c I wanted to run under 2 hours\n45 minutes, so I was very happy with\n2:39:26\u201d.\nHappy he should be, as that time\nmeant he came 160th overall (out of\nover 36 000 participants) and first in\nthe BUCS championships. This surprised even him, though: \u201cI had actually forgotten that I entered the BUCS\nMarathon Championships, so it was\nonly on the evening after the race that\nI looked up the times of the other guys\nand found out I had won! I also saw\nthat one of the others who finished just\nbehind me had been 4 minutes ahead\nat halfway. This made all the pain\nworth it.\u201d\nAnother taste of success, then, to cap\noff what has been a rewarding year, as\nSecondyearMathsstudentAlex Milnerana\nblistering2:39:26intheLondonMarathonto\nwintheBUCSmarathonChampionships.\nIndy Leclercqfindsoutmore\nAlex also won the Herts Cross Country Championships and the London\nColleges Cross Country League, and\ncame second in the Berkhamsted half\nmarathon.\nHowever, when asked about running\nfuture marathons, he remains unsure.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tough question. I have now\nqualified for a championship place so\nit\u2019s tempting. However, I might give it a\nrest for a few years to focus on 5km to\nhalf marathon. My next main goal is to\nrun a half marathon in under 70 min-utes, as that would be getting me closer\nto the elite times.\u201d\nFinally, does he have any tips for\nthose of us who want to try running a\nmarathon for ourselves?\n\u201cI think everyone should run a marathon at least once in their lives. It is a\nunique challenge and if you want to\ntest yourself this is the way to do it. In\nterms of training, the most important\nthing is getting in some runs of at least\n20 miles at a fairly easy pace. It may\nsound like lots, but it will go by quickly\nand you (but not your legs) will feel\ngreat afterwards. In the race, the one\nthing you should not do is go out too\nfast. It\u2019s easy to get excited and forget\nyou still have a hell of a long way to go.\u201d\nIn any case, Alex showed a lot of grit\nin this year\u2019s run, and his words are\nsomething to ponder for the would-be\nmarathoner. Maybe future years will\nbring more Imperial participants in the\ntesting ordeal!\nAlex would like to thank the Cross\nCountry and Athletics Club for the\ngreat training sessions, and his girl-friend, Jessica Floyd, for supporting\nhim all the way.\n\u201cI was feeling\nreally good...I\nhad stuck to the\npace I wanted and\nthe noise from\nthe crowds was\nincredible\u201d\nLondon\nMarathon\n2010 :\nthe Lowdown\n\u2022 Number of runners :\n36,522\n\u2022 t26-mile course starts\nin Blackheath, goes\nthrough east London\nand the city and\nfinishes on the Mall\n\u2022 Top prize : $ 55, 000\n(for the first-placed\nMen\u2019s and Women\u2019s\nrunners (total prize\nmoney $295,000)\n\u2022 Course record : 2:05:10,\nset by 2009 winner\nSammy Wanjiru\n\u2022 The London marathon\nalso comprises a\nwheelchair race along\nthe same course\n\u2022 2010 winner : Kenyan\nTsegaye Kebede in\n2:05:19\n\u2022 1st-placed Briton\nAndrew Lemoncello\ncame 8th\n\n"

However, a crisis\nis brewing on campus after the ticket\nprices for the event were officially revealed online \u2013 prices that have been\nseen by many as \u201cextortionate\u201d.\ntertainments tickets for \u00a370.\nFreshers have been taken aback by\nthe pricing, despite many having little prior knowledge of previous ticket\nprices, with one noting that, \u201cit\u2019s pretty\nexpensive despite the acts going.\u201d\nAnother commented that, \u201cthe dinner tickets are too much really, considering the price of the entertainments\nonly tickets,\u201d before adding, \u201cbut people\nwould feel cheated if they didn\u2019t have a\nridiculously overpriced Summer Ball.\u201d\nThe sudden increase in price is only\nlikely to bring further disappointment\nto those who still find themselves in\nan examination period on 19th June.\nIn previous years, biologists and biochemists have been subjected to this,\nand this summer is unlikely to prove\nany different.\nEven those previously restricted by\nexams have been less than enthusiastic over developments, as the following student states, \u201cI\u2019m a 3rd year\nBiologist and hence I\u2019ve missed every\nSummer Ball the last two years due to\nexams. Finally I\u2019m free to attend, and\nI can\u2019t really afford it. \u00a390 is several\nweeks\u2019 food bill. Looks like I\u2019m not\ngoing!\u201d\nOrganisers have responded to critics\nwith the following statement, \u201cThis\nyear we are offering a much-improved\nline-up and so if you purchase your\nticket at the first-day discounted rate\nyou will be paying no more that lastyear\u2019s price of \u00a340. For dinner tickets\nwe took the decision to no longer sub-sidise the cost of the meal. This was\na difficult decision but one that was\ntaken so that all students attending the\nball could benefit from any reduced\ncosts, not just the diners. The Summer\nBall is a non-profit making event and\nis currently budgeted to break-even. If\nwe find ourselves in a position of having sold more tickets than budgeted\nour intention is to divert that profit\nback into making the event even better through free drinks or more acts.\nComparing our ball\u2019s prices to other\nLondon and equivalent Students\u2019 Unions \u00a345 represents great value compared to the line-up we have. I look\nforward to seeing you all there!\u201d\nImperial wins BP Challenge\nImperial\u2019s \u2018\u2019Meltdown\u2019\u2019 team has\nemerged victorious in BP\u2019s Ultimate\nField Trip Challenge.

The team competed against fifty-two entries in the\nUK in total and will now complete a\nsix to eight week paid internship with\nBP North Sea this Summer.\nBen Said, who was \u2018\u2019delighted to\nhave won the Ultimate Field Trip\u2019\u2019,\ncommented that they had \u2018\u2019worked\nexceptionally hard since the Autumn\nof last year\u2019\u2019 and that they are \u2018\u2019looking forward to starting the BP internship where [they] hope to learn even\nmore about the energy industry and\nthe challenges it faces.\u2019\u2019\nAlongside Meltdown, Hot Carbon\nfrom Imperial also made it to the\nGrand Finals and were another team\nto receive job interviews.\nDavid Eyton, Group Head of Research and Technology, BP, com-mented: \u2018\u2019We were really impressed\nwith the way Meltdown approached\nthe brief and their consistent performance throughout the competition.\nTheir concept has considered both the\neconomic and scientific challenges we\nface, whilst the entry was technically\nadvanced and well thought through\n\u2013 our industry is crying out for these\nbright young minds. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll\nbe hearing about Lizzie Riley, Chris\nHunter and Ben Said in the future.\u2019\u2019\nBP was so impressed with the level\nof talent at the Grand Final that they\ndecided to grant all fifteen finalists, as\nan unexpected bonus, an automatic\ninterview with BP upon graduation.\nAlex Karapetian\nAlex Karapetian\nFaculty Union election results\nT\nhe end of last term saw\nmany opportunities to vote\nfor your say in the way\nthings are run around here,\nfinishing with elections\nfor Faculty Union positions within the\nRCSU, ICSMSU and CGCU.\nThe RCSU elections showed many\nfresh faces willing to get involved in the\nfaculty union next year, including some\nfirst years running for positions. After\na successful year under the presidential\ncontrol of Katya-Yani Vyas, the RSCU\nhave held many popular events, including the Science Challenge, comedy\nnights, and the first-ever faculty union\nWelfare Week.\nAfter Vyas finishes her presidency at\nthe end of the year, she will be replaced\nby Scott Heath, currently a third year\nChemist. According to Scott, he has\n\u201ca great deal of energy and excitement\nabout becoming next years RCSU President and can safely say all of this enthusiasm will be well directed into providing a bigger and more noticed RCSU.\u201d\nThe ICSMSU elections saw the biggest turn-out of voters ever, with over\n1,100 students participating. David\nSmith will take over from Anil Chopra in the running of the faculty union\nwhich represents the medical students\nof Imperial. Currently a third year stu-dent, Dave will be taking a sabbatical\nyear in order to fulfil his (extensive)\nmanifesto points. Progressing from Entertainment Chair in the ISCMSU to\nPresident will no doubt be a challenge,\nhe hopes to encourage social events for\nmedics, continue the high standard of\nteaching within the faculty and maintain the \u201cfamily environment\u201d\u2019 present\non the Charing Cross Hospital Campus.\nAfter a turbulent year in the CGCU\noffice with the resignation of Kirsty\nPatterson and swift take-over from\nDan Lundy, Engineers will hope to\nsee a more stable committee for the\nCGCU this year.\nHe-in Cheung, currently a second\nyear Mechanical Engineering student,\nis to take over as Guilds President.\nThe election was a close one, with Hein narrowly beating Amaury (Frank)\nFastenakels in the third round of the\nsingle-transferable vote style of elec-tions. Unfortunately, RON (Re-Open\nNominations) had the most number\nof votes for thet position of Web Officer, but the position will be taken\nover by current Live! Editor, Lawrence\nWeetman.\nEach of the incoming presidents,\nalong with their committees will officially take over from this year\u2019s representatives on 1st August 2010.\nCharlotteMorris\nCharlotteMorris\nSummer Ball 2010 price hike criticised\nMatt Colvin reports on students\u2019 reaction to this year\u2019s increased prices, and how the Union have justified them\nDespite this, there appears to be a\ngeneral consensus across college that\nwhile the line-up is of a good quality,\nthe pricing is just too high, as summarised by this comment from another\n3rd year, \u201cThe acts are OK, but I\u2019m not\nsure how different the Summer Ball\nwill be from last year. It\u2019s got to justify\nthe price hike, and I\u2019m not sure I want\nto gamble my money to find out if it\ndoes!\u201d\nIt seems that the most expensive\nquestion Imperial students will be\nanswering during this exam period\nis whether the Summer Ball will be\nworth it or not.\nTouted as the centrepiece of the\nSummer Term, this year\u2019s Summer\nBall is promised by organisers to \u201cbuild\non the success of previous balls that\nhave cemented the event\u2019s reputation\nas the best night of the year at Imperial\u201d, featuring performances from The\nNoisettes, Tinie Tempah and Plan B.\nHowever, the pricing of the event has\nleft many disgruntled, with a significant\nincrease in ticket costs compared with\nlast year.

What I\nintended, what I could only wish to have\ndone, was to be more considerate.\nI wished I had told her that I didn\u2019t\nmean to chastise. I wished I had enquired\nabout her welfare, her studies, and encouraged her to work towards a better fu-ture.IwishedIhadexplained how Ididn\u2019t\nwant to contribute, by doling out the\nspare change, towards an already existent\nbegging culture, or her becoming a beg-gar. Above all, considering I\u2019m virtually\nilliterate in Arabic and French, I wished\nI had possessed a better understanding of\nthe languages within her grasp, in order\nto speak the then unspoken words.\nBut then, I didn\u2019t wish.\nI regretted.\n*\nThe High Atlas had a way of unfolding\nits life story, one rock formation at a time,\nas though the mountain ranges were\nplaythings of nature. The heaps of stone\nit constructed, and the landslides where\nit had trampled on like a sandcastle dis-favoured. The technicolour outcrops as\ncanvases upon which it had crayoned\nand painted. Riverbeds the trail of rubble it had left behind as it frolicked, layers\nof bedding blankets it had unfurled and\ncrinkled. Tears it shed on the boulders,\nboring and eroding them into the peculiarity the locals have affectionately named\n\u2018The Hand of Fatima\u2019. The Dad\u00e8 valley\nand gorge gouged out of a boyish rage.\nThe van took another bend uneasily\nas it raced towards Marrakech against\nnightfall. My gaze remained apathetically\nfixed on what lied beyond the window.\nI was reading the geology like a book. A\nchildren\u2019s book of unspeakable mischief.\nIt was then when I was hit by an unsettling feeling.\nUltimately, I had failed my purpose as\na traveller.\nI had failed to read the people.\nI had betrayed my humanity when\nmany more children swarmed us with\npleas and open palms, as we stopped by\nthe dilapidated Berber quarters of a small\ntown. I sent them away with scorns, with\nenough phrases of the lingo to banish\nthem back to the slums they belonged.\nI failed to understand them. Especially\n\u201c...my ignorance of\na place was simply\nreplaced by my\nignorance of the\npeople\u201d\nwhen, as I sneaked a glance before my entourage exited the mud brick ghetto, the\nbeggars transformed back to their natural juvenile form, seemingly immune to\nour aloofness.\nFor all my fondness and fascination\nfor the Moroccan people and culture,\nmy experience with them during the excursion didn\u2019t exactly leave me singing\npraises. Somehow I felt mistreated by my\ndriver, who would happily charge us for\nevery piece of information that parted his\nlips; I felt disappointed by the camel tour\nguides, whose drum beats in a fleeting\nsoiree couldn\u2019t be more short of enthusi-asm, whose dialogues couldn\u2019t lack more\nwarmth and sincerity.\nFor we were investors of rehearsed the-atrics and, not only that we didn\u2019t pay for\nit, we expressed no interest in taking the\nbackstage tour.\nIf only my French was up to scratch, my\nArabic sufficient to propel a conversa-tion. If only the way I acted had been less\ndetached, and more like that attitude that\nhave me welcomed, time to time, to the\nhospitality that Moroccans are famed for,\nthat I have received with gratitude.\nIf only I could cry \u2018No, I have no regrets\u2019\nto the heavens and not be struck down by\naccusations of hypocrisy.\nSensually, it had been a fantastic jour-ney: my appetite for natural beauty and\naction had been utterly quenched. It\nwas by no means closure since, stepping\nout of the van into the hectic nightlife\nof Marrakech, I now bore the burden of\na damaged conscience for my ignorance\nof the people that simply replaced my\nignorance of a place. Thus, which might\none day bring me back to Morocco once\nagain if I must sprinkle some optimism\nonto the wound, was what I got out of the\ndesert excursion \u2013 a regret.\nThough let\u2019s not forget about that\ndamned carpet burn that bugged me for\nmany days to come.\nClockwise from\ntop: the ksar of\nA\u00eft Benhaddou;\ncamel train\nacross sand\ndunes; signs\nadvertising for\nBerber carpet\nshops; the road\nto Tamddakhte;\nthe mud-brick\nmellah, or Jewish\nquarters, now\ninhabited by\nBerber families\nB\nonjour and welcome back to\nwhat is widely regarded as the\nmost dreaded semester of the\nyear. Best of luck to you all for\nthe exams you must endure,\npast and future; just try not to die of caffeine overdose.\nDepressing stuff aside, hope you\u2019ve all\nhad a wonderful Easter break. And may I\nextend my congratulations to those who\nsuccessfully hitchhiked to Morocco/\nPrague \u2013 36 of you from the London\nregion and some 1500 across the UK \u2013\nmany of which I had the privilege to meet\nalong the way. A massive thank you on\nbehalf of Link Community Development for your fundraising efforts as well.\nAnd speaking about the Easter holi-days, can there be a bigger scandal in the\ntourism industry than that triggered by a\nlittle bit of geological activity?\nIt has been estimated that, with more\nthan 100,000 flights grounded, over 10\nmillion passengers worldwide were left\nstranded throughout the six-day airport\nclosures.\nInconvenient, to say the least \u2013 what\nhad set out as a leisurely break acidified\nfor those who had to squander hours for a\nfutile wait, had to seek alternative methods of transport (should have hitchhiked,\npeople), had to spend extra cash during\nan extended, now bitter stay at their holiday destination.\nFor some, however, it wasn\u2019t merely\nexams that were missed and work left\nunattended.\nHundred of Britons are now reported\nto be caught up by the civil unrest that\nhad stirred up in Bangkok. With 27 people killed so far and many more injured\namid the anti-government protests,\nholidaymakers who obviously no longer\ntook pleasure in staying, besieged the\nairport as they attempt to secure flights\nback home. Such was the desperation\nthat travellers are prepared to employ\ndeception to get prioritised over the rest\nof those who are stranded, states BBC\nNews.\n\u2018Rescue attempts\u2019 have been mounted\nto bring stranded Britons home, especially when many other services, including the Eurostar and ferry firms, are completely sold out.\nMy personal favourite was the short-lived rescue effort set up by the TV presenter and historian Dan Snow, who\nplanned to travel across the English\nChannel with a fleet of speedboats. As\nwell as running a ferry service throughout the day, his intentions included paying tribute to the 70th anniversary of the\nDunkirk evacuation.\nThree boats and 25 passengers later, the\nendeavour was prematurely shut down by\nFrench officials for no apparent reason.\nBAA has estimated a \u00a328m loss as a result of the volcanic ash, with the total cost\nto the airline companies and tour operators estimated to be between 1.5 to 2.5 billion euros by the European Commission.\nThe effects of the Eyjafjallajokull eruption are by no means a thing of the past:\nits blow to the aviation industry, described to be a \u2018logistical nightmare\u2019 by\na contributing editor of Airliner World,\nwill take much more to resolve than the\nlifting of the air space ban. The disruption\nof intricately-designed flight schedules,\ncrew management, fixed operation costs,\nnot to mention the tsunami of claims by\nestranged passengers over expenses and\ncancelled flights: a crippling effect to an\nalready struggling industry.\nAnd with airlines such as Ryanair expressing reluctance in paying passengers\u2019\nhotel and food bills, and British Airways\nalleged to be preferring new passengers\nover those with existing yet delayed bookings \u2013 much to the outrage of the general\npublic \u2013 their financial desperation was\npretty transparent.\nWhich reminds me: I\u2019m meant to book\nmy flight ticket to New Zealand this after-noon. Heh, wish me luck.\n\n"

    "content": "8 felix FRIDAY 30 APRIL 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nReforming laws that will allow scientists the freedom of speech\nL\nargely thanks to an ongoing\nhigh-profile campaign led by\nlobbying group Sense about\nScience, all three parties have\nmade libel reform an issue worthy of\ntheir manifestos. The loud call for a\nchange in English libel laws came when\nfamous science author and Imperial College alumnus Simon Singh was\nsued by the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) for what they claimed\nwere \u201cdefamatory\u201d comments made by\nSingh in The Guardian.\nDespite the recent news that the\nBCA have backed down from the case,\neffectively handing Singh the victory,\nhe is still several thousands of pounds\nin debt. Current libel laws in England\nare stifling fair debate and effective\nfreedom of speech in scientific issues;\nit is the almost guaranteed financial\nburden that scares writers defending\nthemselves in court.\nThe issue has seen much media attention in recent times thanks to\nSingh. The fact all three leading parties are now using libel reform as campaign ammunition \u201cis a great tribute to\ngrassroots pressure on politicians\u201d said\nSingh.\nSpeaking to felix, he further emphasised the importance of libel reform to\nImperial\u2019s students.\n\u201cThis is an issue that should be close\nto hearts of Imperial College staff and\nstudents for a whole host of reasons.\nFor example, science can only progress\nthrough open and frank discussion, but\nEnglish libel law can chill and crush\nsuch debate. Also, unless scientists and\njournalists can discuss ideas freely and\nfairly, then the public will not hear the\nwhole truth on matters of serious public interest,\u201d he said.\nLabour\u2019s manifesto promises that reform will occur to \u201cprotect the right of\ndefendants to speak freely.\u201d The Conservatives follow suit with an outline\nexplanation of their proposed plans\nto tackle the troublesome libel laws:\n\u201cWe will review and reform libel laws\nto protect freedom of speech, reduce\ncosts and discourage libel tourism.\u201d\nThe Lib Dems have given a more\ndetailed description of changes to be\nmade in libel laws. They will protect\nscientists in open forums of debate\nagainst unfair libel action by \u201crequiring corporations to show damage and\nprove malice or recklessness, and by\nproviding a robust responsible journalism defence.\u201d\nDespite party promises, Singh is not\ncontent with what his court battles\nhave helped yield. He will continue to\ncampaign for the greater good of science in the mainstream media.\n\u201cIn short, it is generally acknowledged that we have the most oppres-sive, one-sided and anti-free speech\nlibel laws in the democratic world,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThe challenge will be to make\nsure that the next government acts on\nits manifesto pledge.\u201d Simon Singh, holding the scarf, after a court battle against the BCA\nS\nerving a region of communities that span right across\nthe spectrum is no easy job.\nWhoever takes up the parliamentary seat for Kensington\nwill have to contend with just that.\nThe Kensington constituency, previously Kensington & Chelsea under\nthe old constituency boundaries, has\nbeen a Conservative stronghold for\nmany years now. This is thanks to the\nlarge numbers of affluent residents living around South Kensington, Notting\nHall and King\u2019s Road. Amongst them\nhowever, sits North Kensington\u2019s more\ndeprived areas and also hubs of student residences.\nMP for Kensington & Chelsea, Sir\nMalcolm Rifkind, is a backbencher\nwith an illustrious political history\nwith the Tories. He served under Margaret Thatcher as Secretary of State for\nForeign and Commonwealth Affairs\nand Secretary of State for Defence,\nand even contested the leadership with\nher successor, John Major in the early\nnineties.\nRifkind is looking to scrap the Western Extension Zone by the end of this\nyear.\n\u201cExtending Congestion Charging to\nKensington was always about raising\nmoney, as opposed to easing traffic\nflows,\u201d he said.\nAddressing the student body so important to Kensington\u2019s locale was\nseemingly not a priority, failing to respond to felix\u2019s questions.\nIn comparison, Sam Gurney, Labour\u2019s PPC for Kensington was more\nin tune with Imperial students\u2019 strife.\n\u201cIf elected I will seek to represent\nall Kensington residents to the best of\nmy ability, but my focus will be making Kensington a fairer place for all,\nincluding Imperial students. One of\nthe central focuses of our campaign is\nthe need for more affordable housing\nin the area, many local students are\nforced to move away on completion of\ntheir studies and many other Imperial\nstudents have to commute long distances just to get to college.\u201d\nLib Dem PPC, Robin Meltzer, looked\nto draw on wider policies his party\nstood for: to address the financial burden all university students are saddled\nwith.\n\u201cThe first thing to say is that the Liberal Democrats are the only party committed to scrapping university tuition\nfees. University education should be\nfree and admissions based on ability\nnot bank balance. We will scrap unfair tuition fees for all students taking\ntheir first degrees saving them nearly\n\u00a310,000 each.\n\u201cWe have a financially responsible\nplan to phase fees out over six years,\nso that the change is affordable in these\ndifficult economic times,\u201d he said to\nfelix.\n\u201c[Libel reform] is an\nissue that should\nbe close to hearts\nof Imperial College\nstaff and students\u201d\nSimon Singh\nPOOR, POOR STUDENTS\nAs well as their future careers beyond university, there\u2019s also another concern for students:\nthe not-so-small number in red ink on their student loan statements.\nAn average Imperial student on a three-year course will graduate with approximately\n\u00a324,000 of debt, a sum likely to be more than a graduate scheme\u2019s starting salary.\nSo, who\u2019s promising what about the imminent dilemma that could see tuition fees rise\nonce again for students?\nLabour\nLabour will stand their ground on the basic policy their then Education Minister David Blunkett introduced. The party is likely to favour a lift of the cap that means students can only pay\na maximum of \u00a33,500 a year for tuition.\nSaying that, a third of Labour candidates including several prominent members have signed\na pledge organised by the National Union of Students (NUS) to oppose the lift on tuition\nfees. They could hold their weight in any future debates and keep any fee hikes in check.\nConservatives\nThe Conservatives appear to be taking the unpopular decision to not only keep, but also oversee a rise in tuition fees to a reported \u00a37,000 a year.\nRemarkably coy on their position on the matter, the fact is that only thirteen Tory candidates have signed the NUS\u2019s petition opposing the lift on tuition fee caps; this may be telling\nevidence on their official party line.\nThey follow Labour\u2019s lead in awaiting the outcomes that will be derived from Lord\nBrowne\u2019s Higher Education review before making any commitments to those in higher\neducation. The review, which commenced in November 2009, is likely to suggest that an\nincrease in tuition fees is necessary.\nLiberal Democrats\nNick Clegg has reaffirmed his position to scrap all tuition fees this General Election. Though\na party divide has seemingly arisen over the matter, the Lib Dem manifesto promises to phase\nout tuition fees for students by 2015. Under this radical plan, final year students will be alleviated of their debts first.\n\u201cStudents want to be treated like grown-ups; they know money doesn\u2019t grow on trees. That\u2019s\nwhy we have agreed together to lay out a financially responsible timetable to scrap fees, step\nby step, after the general election,\u201d said Clegg.\ner\nervi\nving\nng\ng\ng a\na\na\na r\nreg\negio\nion\nn of\nof c\ncom\nommu\nmu\nm -h h\nse\nseem\nem\nemin\ni\ningl\nl\ngly\ny no\nnot\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt a\na pr\nprio\niori\nrity\nty,\n, f\nfa\nfail\nil\ni\nilin\ni\ning\ng to\nto\nto\nto r\nr\nre\ne-e-d f l \u2019\nAround the corner\nCandidates running for Imperial\u2019s local\nconstituency, Kensington, speak to felix\nGENERAL ELECTION\n\n"

    "content": "25\nfelix FRIDAY 30 APRIL 2010\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk TECHNOLOGY\nest of what you missed over the break\nL\nove it or hate it, the iPhone is a pretty big part of the modern smartphone\nmarket, and as such is currently the phone to beat. Apple is expected to\nrelease a brand new iPhone in the summer, but normally it\u2019s legendary culture of secrecy keeps leaks to an absolute minimum, leaving the technology press\nto rely on assumption and rumour. This month however Apple\u2019s vice-like grip\nslipped and out popped an iPhone prototype. Encased in a custom cover to make\nit look like an ordinary everyday iPhone 3GS, the iPhone prototype was dropped\nby an Apple engineer in a bar in California, where it was picked up and promptly\nsold to Gizmodo for a purported $5000. When Gizmodo unwrapped the now\nremote-wiped and non-functional device, they found an iPhone without the curvaceous back of the current generation and a metal strip around it\u2019s edges. As you\ncan see in the photo above, the front of the device resembles that of the previous\ngeneration, but the rest of the device makes a distinct departure from what\u2019s currently available from Apple.\nD\nell\u2019s been pretty busy behind the scenes over Easter and on April 21st, the\nmother of all leaks landed in the laps of the Engadget crew. In the leak\nthere were details and photos of no less than five previously unknown\ndevices and more detail on two as yet unreleased gadgets. The bounty detailed\none Windows Phone 7 device, the Lightning, three Android phones, the Thunder, Flash and Smoke, plus the previously known Aero and a seven-inch Android\nbased tablet called the Looking Glass, which will join the previously detailed Dell\nStreak Android tablet. Whilst each device has its own merit and target market,\nlet\u2019s have a look at the two flagship devices Dell\u2019s aiming at your wallet.\ne OS4\nbile OS X based operating system\nLeaked iPhone Prototype Dell\u2019s Device Deluge\nDell\u2019s Thunder lights-up Android\nApple\u2019s iPhone prototype. Could this be the iPhone for you this summer?\nthe Amazon Kindle and iPhone app, it\u2019ll sync\nyour reading position between your iPhone\nand your iPad. Game Center was another\nbig unveil, which is aiming to bring you an\nXbox Live-like experience with multiplayer\nmatchmaking, achievements and all the\ngoodies you\u2019ve come to expect from modern\nonline gaming. Now all they need to do is\ngive the iPhone and iPod touch some more\nbuttons so the control schemes of iPhone\ngames don\u2019t suck.\nLast but not least Apple took a swipe at\nGoogle and its mobile advertising division\nwith the announcement of iAds. Essentially\nApple is building an advertising platform\ndirectly into its mobile operating system\nand you\u2019re going to love it! OK, I might be\nexaggerating just a tad here, I\u2019m as sceptical\nas you as to whether this is actually better for\nthe user, but Apple showed off interactive ads\nthat are unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before.\nLet\u2019s just hope it doesn\u2019t turn the iPhone an\nad-riddled mess like the internet has become.\nLike pervious iPhone OS updates, iPhone\nOS4 is going to be available as an upgrade\nfor previous iPhone models. The kicker here\nthough, is that original (2G) iPhone owners\nand iPod touch owners are going to be left\nout in the cold. iPhone 3G owners are going\nto get a lot of the newfangledness, but you\u2019re\ngoing to be missing out on multitasking,\nwallpapers and some other smaller things.\nOf course iPhone 3GS and iPod touch 3rd\ngeneration users are going to get the whole\nshebang, but it might cost you, we\u2019ll have\nto wait till closer to the \u2018summer\u2019 launch\nwindow to find out. iPad owners/fanciers,\nyou\u2019ll get your taste of iPhone OS4 but you\u2019re\ngoing to have to sit tight till the Autumn.\nOh and those living on the wild side will be\npleased to know it\u2019s already been jailbroken.\nApart from its looks, Gizmodo discovered that the prototype device was packing\na front facing camera, a larger camera lens on the back with an LED flash and a\nlarger battery. The screen itself was marginally physically smaller, but was said to\nhave a much higher pixel density, laying credence to the iPhone HD rumours. The\nvolume rocker had also been replaced with two separate buttons, possibly indicating some sort of dual functionality, a dedicated photo button in the Camera\napp perhaps. Those of you hoping to slap your current SIM in the next generation\niPhone will be sorely disappointed as it seems, just like the iPad, Apple has gone\nfor a micro SIM slot. Don\u2019t fret however; all current major iPhone carriers have\nannounced that they\u2019ll be supporting the new SIM standard.\nOf course this \u2018find\u2019 didn\u2019t necessarily have to have been an actual Apple\nprototype, but its authenticity was confirmed when Apple themselves asked\nfor the device back. Since then the saga of returning the iPhone and now just\nthis week, the Police raid on the Gizmodo Editor Jason Chen\u2019s house over the\npurchase of \u2018stolen\u2019 goods, has raged. What next will unfold and whether we\u2019ll see\nthis type of device come July is unknown, but I for one am itching to see the how\nthe rest of this story is going to unfold. Head on over to Gizmodo for full coverage\nincluding a blow-by-blow account of how the phone ended up with Gizmodo.\nSide-by-side: Grandad iPhone next to new and shiny.\nDell\u2019s top class entry into the Windows Phone 7 space: the Lighting\nSo what does the Dell Lightning have in store for us? Well as you can see above\nit\u2019s a pretty slick looking portrait QWERTY slider like that of the Palm Pre, with\nthe required three button Windows Phone 7 control scheme up front. Packing a\n4.1 inch WVGA OLED capacitive touch screen, the Lightning is powered by a\n1GHz Snapdragon processor, the QSD8250 for those keeping count. Dell saw fit\nto give Windows Phone 7 512MB of RAM to play with and on the storage front\n1GB of built-in flash plus an 8GB of MicroSD, plenty of space for your apps. Of\ncourse the Lightning also comes equipped with the usual array of toys including\nGPS, an accelerometer, a compass, an FM radio, a 5MP autofocus camera and\nfull Flash support. Looking decidedly\nlike a Windows Phone 7 launch device\nyou can look forward to getting your\ngrubby mitts on it in the fourth quarter\nof this year, with an LTE (read 4G) version scheduled for Q4 of 2011.\nIf Android is your thing, and let\u2019s be\nhonest, Windows Phone 7 has potential but it\u2019s starting to look a little outdated even now, and it\u2019s not been released yet, then Dell\u2019s got lots for you.\nThe Thunder pictured left does away\nwith the sliding keyboard that defines\nthe Lightning, for a sleeker package.\nLike the Lightning however, the Thunder packs a 4.1 inch WVGA OLED\nscreen, but the rest of the specifications are a little sketchy at this point.\nIt\u2019ll probably be running a similar\nSnapdragon CPU and storage; however Dell has upped the camera to an\n8MP shooter. With Android 2.1 Dell\u2019s\ngone all out on the customization with\nthe device running Dell \u2018Stage\u2019 UI tying into Facebook and Twitter for social networking and using Swype for its\nonscreen keyboard. It certainly looks\nclassy and has a similar feel to that of\nHTC\u2019s Sense UI.\nDell also claims that it\u2019ll have Flash\nand a Hulu app on the device at launch,\nnot that that\u2019s much use to us over here\nin Blighty. Give us iPlayer, eh Dell?\n\n"

The announcement made via Chancellor of\nExchequer Alistair Darling\u2019s pre-budget report is seemingly\na U-turn on Gordon Brown\u2019s earlier promise, in which he\npledged a ten-year commitment from 2004 in maintaining scientific funding and the continuation of ring-fenced\nbudgets.\n\u201cSome say that now is not the time to invest but the bottom line is that the downturn is no time to slow down our\ninvestment in science. We will not allow science to become\na victim of the recession but, rather, focus on developing it\nas a key element of our path to recovery,\u201d he said. Despite\nthe funding cuts attracting criticism from those within the\nscientific community, Labour are keen to point out that\nthey have doubled investment in research since 1997, the\nyear they came into power. However, the specifics of this\nstatistic have openly disputed by the Liberal Democrats.\nHowever, no one can rest on past laurels and it is the future\nfunding commitments that the scientifically-motivated\nvoter will be looking at come May 6th.\nSo what can Labour bring to the table now?\nLabour claim they are \u201ccommitted to a ring-fenced science budget in the next spending review,\u201d and this echoes\nLabour\u2019s science spokesperson Lord Drayon\u2019s call to hold\nonto current science budgeting levels. For a party with its\nhands already on the steering wheel, there is a distinct lack\nof figures and detail to their pledges. There is no written reassurance that their own 10-year commitment will be seen\nthrough to any extent.\nLabour\u2019s separate Science Manifesto states\nthey are keen to support \u201cexcellent research\u201d by \u201cexcellent individuals\u201d through\nlong-term fellowships from Research\nCouncils. \u201cMaintaining world leading research at our universities is a\npriority.\u201d\n\u2018Innovation\u2019 is big on Labour\u2019s\nagenda. They promise to provide\n\u2018focused investment for Technology\nand Innovation Centres\u2019, and to also\nutilise the Higher Education Innovation Fund to help support university\nresearch projects that have social\nand economic impacts. The Science\nManifesto states: \u201cOur future prosperity\nwill demand excellent science. It is critical in securing the recovery and delivering\nstrong economic growth. We are clear:\nscience will be placed at the heart of Labour\u2019s economic growth strategy.\nDespite this, no science policies or\nissues make it into their definitive \u201850\nsteps for a fairer Britain\u2019 featured in the\nmain manifesto.\nA\ndam Afriyie MP, Conservative\u2019s science\nspokesperson, has publically promised\na multi-year ring-fenced budget for sci-ence, should the Conservatives come to\npower. This ring-fence will only come into action\nonce the new Government has set a new Budget\nimmediately after coming into power. There was no\nassurance of maintaining current levels of research fund-ing, and hence a Conservative government could be ring-fencing a decreased level of funding.\nDespite this, David Cameron\u2019s\nrecently published manifesto,\nAn Invitation to join the Government of Britain, mentions future\nfunding budgets in even less detail,\npromising \u201ca multi-year Science and\nResearch Budget to provide a stable\ninvestment climate for Research\nCouncils\u201d. The more eagle-eyed critics\nhave noted that there is no mention of\n\u2018ring-fencing\u2019 specifically; whether this\nomission is extremely careful wording\nor unfortunate phrasing for the Conservatives is still under\ndebate. A science budget set for multiple years will provide\nthe Research Councils with a lot more stability and will allow\nthem to undertake more beneficial, longer-term strategies\nthan they could on single-year budgets provided to them by\na Government. A multi-year budget would definitely affect\ncurrent undergraduates, from 1st year to 4th year, looking to\na career in academic research.\nIn an overlap of academic and corporate science, the\nTories also plan to get universities and businesses to work\ntogether with the establishment of a focused research\nand development institute. Future PhD students may find\nthemselves with much more comfortable financial\nbacking if this plan comes to full fruition, and\nwill also allow a go-between for students unsure\nwhether to stay in academic science at university or to enter the science-based employment\nat for example, a pharmaceutical\ncompany.\nIn response to CaSE\u2019s letter\ninviting him to fully put forward his policies of scientific\nimportance, Cameron called\nscience and engineering in\nthe UK \u201can absolutely critical\nissue\u201d. He gave hints that the\nConservatives would look to\nadvance in corporate science\nable to underpin a currently flailing\neconomy.\n\u201cWe need to translate more of our world-class\nresearch into world-beating British products.\nAnd we need to secure the right economic conditions for businesses to create more well-paid\njobs,\u201d he stated. There is a feeling that a young\nscientific workforce, i.e. Imperial students,\nwould be preferred to enter innovative business than blue-sky academic research.\nC\nompared to the other two parties,\nthe Liberal Democrats have placed\nscience-based issues quite firmly\non their election agenda, claiming they want to move to a \u201cknowledge-based\neconomy\u201d if they find themselves as the next\nGovernment.\nJust for starters, their manifesto has a visibly larger section dedicated to policies based around science policies.\nScience is one of the fronts that the Lib Dems have attempted to capitalise on during this General Election, and\ntheir science spokesperson, Dr. Evan Harris is a popular figure in scientific circles and has undoubtedly championed\nmany of the ideas that have already turned many scientists\u2019\nheads. Nick Clegg was the only party leader to accept an\ninvitation by the prestigious Royal Society to speak on scientific issues.\nSpeaking to felix, Dr. Harris said that the Lib Dem\u2019s \u201chave\nrepeatedly stated that we think the economy needs to be\nbased on high-tech, green foundations, and not just on\nthe financial services.\u201d Though, much like the Labour and\nTory manifesto, the Lib Dems write that \u201cin the current\neconomic climate it is not possible to commit to growth in\nspending.\u201d\nDr. Harris also spelled out how the Lib Dem\u2019s policies\nwould benefit Imperial students.\n\u201cImperial College is one of the country\u2019s and the\nworld\u2019s top universities, and the Liberal Democrats\nwant to keep it that way. Unlike the Conservatives,\nwe\u2019ve already committed to not cutting the science\nbudget in the first year of the new Parliament.\u201d\nHowever leader Clegg conceded in a response to\nthe CaSE letter that \u201cit would be wrong in the\ncurrent economic climate to pledge that any\nsingledepartmentalbudgetwillbeprotected.\u201d\nThe Lib Dems have laid out some good\nnews for students looking to go beyond\nPhD level. Clegg noted that \u201cthere are simply not enough post-doctoral positions\navailable to provide adequate job security for young researchers\u201d and would\nlook to resolve this by several methods\nincluding the encouragement of \u201cindustry-friendly\u201d PhDs.\nOn a more basic level, The Lib Dems are looking\nto take a step back from a target-driven ethos. They\nclaim to recognise that the best way to use funding to its maximum potential is \u201cto enable scientists get on with their work, based on peer review,\nrather than using clumsy mechanistic ways to try\nto direct research into areas of high economic\nimpact.\n1\nTHE CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO 2010\nVE\nMA\nNI\nFE\nST\nO\n201\n0\nINVITATION TO\nJOIN THE GOVERNMENT\nOF BRITAIN\nLiberal Democrats science\nspokesperson, Dr. Evan Harris\nhas said that \u201cLiberal Democrats\nrecognise that Science, Technology,\nand Engineering have to be key drivers\nof our economy as we move out of\nrecession. A knowledge-intensive\neconomy is not only more reliable,\nbut also more rewarding and a better\nstrategic base in the long-term.\u201d\nGENERAL ELECTION\n\n"
