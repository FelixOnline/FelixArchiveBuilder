Sorry, but there it is. Do\nyou like our snappy slogan,\n\"Limbering up for Lent\"? Of\ncourse we cannot afford the big\nagencies yet but the time will\ncome . . . . .\nLet us look at suggestion (1)\n\"Private Prayer to be regular,\nmorning and evening.\" Well, this\nis good sound stuff, but if it does\nnot work, try a laxative. Suggestion (2). . . yes . . . May I expand\na bit on this New English Bible\nbusiness? We felt that the Grammar Schools were getting a little\nbehind in Bible reading mainly\nbecause they couldn't so we got\nsome chaps together (who hadn't even seen a Grammar school,\nactually) and told them to talk\ndown but with dignity so out\ncame this new thing and of\ncourse the people love it. Helped\nto sort out the wheat from the\ngoats among the clergy too.\n(3) Next, I think the greatest of\nGod's gifts to man is the Free\nWill to come to Church and it is\nyour bounden duty to come and\nthank Him for giving you this\nchoice. We will pass on to number (5) now because self-denial is\nparamount in Lent. A few hints\non how to get away with self-denial in company; I have found\nthat \"Doctor's orders,\" \"Throat\ntrouble\" or \"Just had an opera-tion\" are invaluable cover-ups\nagainst pagan curiosity. What's next? Oh yes; Almsgiving, as\nFather Ivor says, this is an integral part of self-denial especially\nas one has to wait so long for the\nThanksgiving. We do not mind if\nyou give the money to charity.\nAnd lastly number (7). Well,\nbeing a gentleman and an evangelist is a little difficult but some\ndiplomacy and some One-up man ship( we call it Holier-than Thou) should help to bring other\nsheep to the fold. Do make sure\nthey are sheep, it saves so much\ntrouble with the newspapers.\nCLIVE B. HEATH.

I 've joined the winning side. NUS is not worth\n\u00a3300 to ICU. I was rather disappointed in the President's speech\u2014he said nothing. In his\nfirst speech he implied that IC\nhas money to burn and that the\nACC is squandering money on\nbeer. He knows this is not true,\nbut I suppose it is fair debating\ntactics to say so if you can get\naway with it. In his summing up,\nhe glibly described Stacey as\nbeing glib, and Gardiner as sin-ce re. It is a pity that he was not\nmore sincere himself- It is all\nvery well advocating IC representation on outside bodies, but\nhow often does he represent IC\nin UL U Presidents Council ?\nLast week was UL U Rag Week,\nbut I'm afraid that IC did not\nmake any real contribution.\nSurely we could have organised\nsome sort of stunt with all this\nspare administrative talent that\nwe are supposed to have ?\nPerhaps ICU is not all one\ncracks it up to be. I hope that\nwe do better in our own Carnival.\nIC hops have not been too\ngood lately ; attendance seems to\nhave been dropping. Is it the\nbad weather, the lack of pub-li city, or the \" un dance able to \"\njazz bands that have kept the\nbirds away, or is it the un social able atmosphere induced by the\nlarge groups of men at the back\nwho just stand and stare. Whatever the reason, it is high time\nsomething was done to re-establish the IC hops as the best in\ntown.\nLETTER TO THE EDITOR\nDear Sir,\nDo we really have to put up\nwith reading the tasteless rubbish\npublished in \" Auntie Lopes\"\ncolumn ? The elegant ladies of\nICWA must be rather tired of the\nold, so called \" jokes,\" pushed at\nthem by the obviously sex-starved\ncompiler of the column, and most\nstudents at I.C. with an I.Q. over\n60 are not interested in Mr.\nAlison's wild oats.

ENTER BRISTOL PEDAL CAR MARATHON\nFor many weeks past the men of Physics III and II have been\nlabour ing behind locked doors to build the R.C.S. reply to the\nB.R.M.

But not only that. No industrial\nproject or problem stands In isolation. Its'roots rarely\nlie In Industry. So, research In Unilever also means\nresearch In a number of contrasting fields\u2014detergents,\nedible fats, foods, cosmetics\u2014and It means, further,\nresearch in surface chemistry, gly cer l de chemistry,\nprotein chemistry, and a host of equally fundamental\ntopics. It means a community of scientific Interest within\nUnilever, and continuity of academic contact outside it.\nIt can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction\nto the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.\nIt can provide satisfaction In the pursuit of it and\nfinancial reward In the success of It. There Is only one.\nminor hazard. Our standards of acceptance are high.\nWe Invite you to write to Dr. A.

This was eventually successfully repaired but all through\nthe night the tale of disaster con-tin u ed. Wheel spokes were broken\nin a collision, others snapped as\nthe race continued. Nine punctures were repaired before Dave\nJohnson, who had taken over at\nshort notice from 'flu-ridden Keith\nHocking, continued the race.\nSeven hours were lost during the\nnight and it was only due to the\nGuilds team (that had dropped\nout temporarily with a broken\nback axle) that the R.C.S. car\nwas kept going, with two 6 inch\nfront wheels off a pram, replacing\nthe original R.C.S. wheels.\nFrom then- until the end of the\nrace the team hammered round,\nengaging in duels with the leading cars and pushing the rest out\nof the way. Although we could\nnot win we felt we could provide\nthe thousands of spectators, who\nhad turned out to see the end\nof the race, something to talk\nabout; and I'm sure they will\nremember the sight of Emlyn\nJones lapping at speed with\nbeard flying behind him and Steve\nColgan's brilliant attack on the\nlap record which failed by only\n3 5 sees \u2022\nR.C.S. finished 13th out of the\nfield of 50 after 13\\ hours pedal-ling, and as the Guilds and\nR.C.S. cars completed their last\nlap, the combined teams rocked\nthe pits with a mammoth \" Hey\nVivo ! \"\nC. McCANN.\nFILM SOCIETY\nOn Friday, 15th March, at 7.0\np.m. in Physics Lecture Theatre\n2, the society is showing two\nfilms, \" The Navigator\" and\n\"Destiny of a Man,\" and these\nwill be followed by the A.G.M.\" The Navigator,\" starring and\nco-directed by Buster Keaton,\nmust surely rate as a classic of\nthe silent cinema. It is notable\nfor its elaborate staging, novel\nmechanical effects and continuous flow of humour (such as\nhis attempt to shuffle a pack of\nwet playing cards) which is just\nas funny to-day as in the mid-twenties when the film was a box-office success. The measure\nof Keaton's genius can never be\nbetter as sse s sed than in this\ncleverly made comedy, where he\ngets the laughs without apparently moving a single facial\nmuscle. Only once did he smile\nin one of his films but so effectively did this kill the joke that he\nnever tried it again. The piano\naccompaniment will be by Mr.\nArthur Dulay, resident pianist at\nthe National Film Theatre, who\nwill also introduce the film.\n\" Destiny of a Man \" is one of\nthe best films to come out of the\nUSSR in recent years. Directed\nand produced by Sergei Bondarchuk, who also plays the leading\nrole, the film tells the life story\nof a village carpenter, but is\nmostly concerned with war and\nhis experiences in Nazi concentration camps. It is intensely\ndramatic and imbued with profound philosophical reflections\n\u2014what is man's place in life and\nwhat is happiness in the noblest\nsense of the word ? Without\nbeing sentimental, \" Destiny of a Man \" shows the true meaning of\nthe traditional manly virtues of\ncourage, endurance and love, and\nreminds us of what the world of\nhuman beings is really like.\nMembers are reminded that\nnominations for next year's committee are due by March 14th. Also every consideration will be\ngiven to suggestions for future\nprogrammes, both for shorts and\nfeatures, so please bring them\nalong to the A. G.M.A question\nto be discussed then is the aims\nand objects of the society. In\npast years, the programmes\ntended to be of a specialised\nnature whereas now they cover\na wide range of film making.\nIf there is sufficient demand, it\nmay be possible next year to\narrange a series of films and discussion groups on the work of,\nsay, Eisenstein or Bergman on\nWednesday afternoons and to\nshow popular entertainment films\non Friday evenings. It is hoped\nthat as many members as possible will come to this meeting to\ndiscuss this.\nOn Thursday, March 21st, the\nsociety is arranging a General\nStudies lecture by Stuart Hall of\nthe British Film Institute. The\nsubject will be \" War Films \" and\nthe lecture will be illustrated with\nfilm extracts.\nR.S. ROBERTSHAW.\n\n"

    "content": "4 FELIX FELIX PROFILES \u2022\nThe Dean\nof\nMines\nPROFESSOR J.G. BALL, B. Sc, F. IM.\nComing to the Royal School of Mines in 1956 as Professor of\nPhysical Metallurgy, Professor J.G. Ball was, within two years,\nHead of the Metallurgy Department and was elected Dean in\nOctober 1962.\nHis career, since graduation from Birmingham, has been basically one of research, firstly with the British Welding Research\nAssociation and later with the A.E.R.E. at Harwell.\nProfessor Ball's attempts to brighten the sombre surroundings of\nthe Metallurgy Department with a selection of paintings are much\nappreciated, but this was not his first essay into visual stimulation.\nResearch reveals that he and the staff of the B. W.R. A. decided to\nbrighten up the office there and\nnc ing impatient for the appearance of skilled decorators tried to\ntackle the job themselves. On\nthat occasion, however, the untimely bursting of a distemper\nspray resulted in the then senior\nmetallurgist being so completely\nwhite-washed that it is said that\nthen he was able to.join the\nA.E.R.E. without any questions\nbeing raised.\nDuring his time in the Welding\nResearch Association Professor\nBall worked on the welding of\nlight alloys and structural steels,\nand the development of new alloy\nsteels of good \" weld ability.\" He\nwas particularly concerned with\nimprovements in the fabrication\nand welding of Baily Bridges,\nsections of which he somehow\nmanaged to construct and dismantle in a tiny basement room.\nAt the A.E.R.E. in 1949, Ball\ntook over re a search and development on plutonium. At this there\nthere was no collaboration with\nthe Americans and the properties\nof the element were an unknown\nquantity apart from the fact that\nthey were rather(?) dangerous.\nHe pleasantly recalls the great\nenthusiasm associated with this\nwork under very primitive conditions and certainly far removed\nfrom the multi-million, gleaming\nmo not lithic structures at Harwell\nto-day. As head of a research\ngroup. Professor Ball's first office\nwas in a lavatory, although he\ndid stress that there had been\nsome attempt at conversion. In\nspite of great experimental difficulties associated with the handling of this highly toxic\nmaterial(?) Ball's team was successful and their endeavours were\ncrowned in 1953, by the setting\nup of a production line for manufacturing the plutonium fuel elements required for the cone of\nthe Zephyr fast reactor. In his\nlast three years at Harwell, Professor Ball took charge of the\nReactor Metallurgy Group, which\nwas then responsible for all\naspects of reactor technology.\nAgain this pioneering work was\naccompanied by a great deal of\nenthusiasm and excitement indicated by agreeably working at\nthree in the morning. Asked\nwhat his wife thought of such\nbehaviour, the reply was, \" She\nsometimes brought us coffee\u2014\nwhich had to be inserted through\nthe fence.\"\nProfessor Ball's return to academic life was prompted by the\ngreater breadth of approach and\nintellectual freedom. His appearance at Mines was heralded by\nradical changes in the courses\u2014a necessity in the promotion of\nthe science and a reduction of the\nart. His opinions stem from the\nbelief that the cult of the amateur\nhas far outlived its British use-fulness.\nUnder his guidance the Metallurgy Department has one of the\nlargest postgraduate research\ngroups in Imperial College and he\nis part instigator of a new postgraduate course in Materials\nScience which is to start in the\nAutumn. Further expansion in\nthe form of a new chair in Applied Metallurgy is imminent.\nThese changes have brought\nopinions of distrust from the\ntraditionalists but Ball rightly\npoints out that the R.S. M. was\nfounded by innovators and one\ncannot live on their traditions.\nTo do so would mean that there\nwas no creation and with no\ncreation there is decline.\nProfessor Ball's administrative\nand committee capacity is illustrated by his sitting on over forty\ncommittees both within and outside the College. He classes,\nfrom his position as an academician, the most important as being\nthe General Studies and the\nLibrary Committees. Not merely\ncontent with agreeing that an\neducated student requires far\nmore than a knowledge of his\nnotes he has and is doing a considerable amount of work in this\ndirection. Apart from the paintings which have been hung in\nMines he has arranged for art exhibitions in the Haldane Library.\nProfessor Ball's phenomenal\ncapacity for work is possibly amplified by his leisure activities\nwhich include a voracious appetite for reading, cabinet making\nof a high order, music, photography and, when he has got the\ntime, designing other people's gardens. When taking his vaca-t ions, he and his wife delight in\nunorganised travel and especially\nenjoy touring the art galleries of\nItaly. In a few weeks' time he\nmakes his first visit to the States\nwhere he is going to investigate\nacademic developments in metallurgy and materials science.\nIn Professor Ball there is a man of very broad and developed\ninterests, a man who has the\ncapacity to brilliantly lead a research team and who possesses\nthe qualities of an aware education a list. A man Mines is glad\nmd proud to have as their Dean.\n>. R.W.S. IC\u2014RCM VERDI REQUIEM\n\"NO MORE LANDLADIES\"\nThis is the theme of a directive\nissued by the conductor of I.C. Choir at a recent rehearsal. Why\nshould they be ostr aci sed? Because of their treatment of students ? No ! Their looks ? No !\nTheir morals ? No again. But\nbecause they have formed the\nmajority of the audience at all\nthe recent concerts of the I.C. Choir.\nThe choir is a go-ahead organisation efficiently directed by Dr.\nEric Brown. During the past five\nyears it has increased its membership six fold and this is due to the\nenthusiasm of its conductor. The\nrepertoire is extensive and has included such works as the Monteverdi Vespers, the Mass in B minor by J.S. Bach, and the first\npublic performance of \" No Room at the Inn,\" a carol composed by Christopher Shaw, the\nchoir's accompanist.\nThe climax of the current year's programme will be a performance\nof the Requiem Mass by Verdi in\nthe Royal College of Music on\nMarch 20th. This has been described as one of Verdi's greatest\nworks, the music resembling\nlight opera rather than a sombre\ndirge, as the title suggests. Could\nanything be so dull with four\ntrumpets and two faggots as part\nof the accompaniment ? Control\nof a full orchestra and nearly 200\nvoices (over 100 of which are\nfemale !) will be in the hands of\nDr. Brown. During rehearsals it\nhas become apparent that the\nchoir's mastery of the intricate\ndynamics (f and p) of this work\nwill be the highlight of the public\nperformance.\n* The concert hall of R.C. N. js\nsmall and will seat only 700\npeople. Already, over 400 tickets\nhave been sold, we suspect to\nlandladies, despite the threat;\nhow pleasant it would be to see\nI.C. students filling the OTHER\nseats at this particular concert.\nRCS3 RD YEAR AND\nPOSTGRADUATES RCS ASSOCIATION A.G.M.

S. hall last Thursday, March 7th, and the motion \" that\nthis College join NUS \" was defeated by 315 to 254 with 14 abstentions. The debate might have been an empty anti-climax, or it\nmight have become a dull repetition of that which went before. In\nfact it was neither; it resolved info an exciting and humorous flow\nof rhetoric and occasional sarcasm. The opposers considered the\nproposer s irrelevant while the latter claimed the former were slan-de rous. The result was an hour's delightful entertainment.\nTWO MOTIONS one as small mm ded as the othe,.\nCONSIDERED\nPRESIDENT PROPOSES\nThe meeting opened in danger\nof sinking in its own medi or crit y.

Blackett.\nMr. Wilson, after first announcing that he did not intend to\nmake a political speech, launched\na scathing and often closely-argued attack on the Government's educational and economic\npolicies.\nHe expressed horror at Lord\nHailsham's complacency over the\nquestion of scientific education,\nand the loss of our graduates to\nAmerica. \"Britain not only produces far too few scientists, she\nwastes too many of those she has\ngot on abortive defence projects\nor on, dreaming up fresh gimmicks with which advertising\nmen persuade us to buy even\nmore of something we didn't even\nknow we wanted in the first\nplace.\"\nLabour would give first priority\nto the Ministry of Science. \"At\npresent the Minister, poor fellow,\nis weighed down with every gimmick a tired and beaten Prime\nMinister can lay on him.

In the\nall-important 2nd VIIFs race, a good start by I.C. gained \\ length\nin the first minute.

C.B.C. entering nine crews. The\nfirst eight home was the U.L. II,\nwhich does not qualify for the\nDixon Bowl, hotly pursued by\nthe I.C.I, which came in at 19\nmins. 52 sees. I.C. crews also\ntook 2nd and 4th places, and the\nfirst novice crew came second in\nthe maidens division, only 27\nseconds behind the winners,\nKings II.\nThere were several surprises in\nthe final placing: it was realised\nthat the I. C.Ill crew had beaten\nI.C. II to the finish by 6 seconds.\nThe much mocked Gentlemen's Eight showed their mettle by\npulling up from their starting\nposition of 20th to 11th, with a time only four seconds slower\nthan the I.C. IV \u2014 quite creditable when it is remembered that\nthey have not had any regular\ncoaching, and have been rowing\nregularly as a crew only this\nterm.\nThe only cloud on the horizon\nwas the navigational error on the\npart of the second novice crew at\nthe end of the course, which resulted in their coming in close\ncontact with one pier of Putney\nBridge with rather disastrous results to the front end of their\nboat.\nNot counting U.L.

The keynote of the tour is\nvariety, and a party of twelve will\nplay the Dutch teams at sports\nincluding swimming, badminton,\ntable tennis, hockey and squash.\nThe following have accepted invitations for the tour : J. Brown,\nJ. Brownlee, M. Bullock, M. Jones, B. Leslie, B. Milner, F. Oestreiches, M. Pleaden, Dr. E. Rhodes, S. Stapley, A. Sutherland\nand K. Tait.\nThe team is particularly strong\nin squash and tennis, and shou H give a very good account of itself\nin these events, and should provide keen opposition in the other\nevents. A few of the team will\nbe competing in several sports, so\nthat it looks like being quite a strenuous tour.\nDeparture date is the 24th March, and the team plan to\nspend a week in Holland, where\nthey hope to combine sport with\na full social programme. It is\nexpected that the result will be\na most enjoyable tour and a boost to women's sport in the\nCollege.\nANNUAL PANCAKE RACE ICWA VICTORIOUS AGAIN The ICWA team won the annual pancake race round the\nquad, mainly due to the lack of\nopposition from their opponents,\nthe Executive. President Oldfield\nlost his pancake, President Little\nhis trousers, Secretary Preece his\numbrella, and President Chandmal his NUS card. All credit,\nhowever, to ICWA for the brave\nway they submitted to ordeal by\nwater deluge and water bomb in\norder to reach their goal.

Among\nthose present were twelve IC\nrepresentatives, seven of these\nbeing from first year Metallurgy,\nmost of them sporting \" Freedom\nfrom Hunger\" posters and assorted clothing. Two of these\ntravelled all the way in the supporting car, their chief duty being\nto brew tea in obscure places for\nthe next 54 miles. The remaining\nten were all walkers, that is, to\nstart with at any rate.\nOf the ten, one dropped out\nwith blistered feet at the first\n.check-point,1\njoining the tea brewing party in the car. Another one\nretired with sore feet, and two\nmore dropped out before the\nthird check-point and were not\nseen again. The last one to give\nup was seen from the car walking\nin the wrong direction\u2014his knee\nhad gone stiff, and this presumably resulting in his turning\nround.\nThe remaining five won\nthrough to the 50 mile check-point, and three of these entered\nBrighton to roars of applause\nfrom assorted sadists and their\ncar travelling colleagues. Those\nwho had failed vowed in a moment of foolishness to try\nagain. In any case, the IC men\ncould claim a50 per cent, success\u2014-the British Army could not\neven claim this much. Of a party\nof eleven from the Royal Signals,\nonly one made it to the finish.\nThis could be an indication that\nthe average student is somewhat\nfitter than the Army.\nocc er( Hub\nMerrie England is green again,\nand soccer players are wearily\nemerging from their igloos pulling ham strings, muscles and\nfingers out in order to achieve the\nfitness weight of last term.\nThe first games of the restart\nwere the U.L.

Only the 1st and\n6th XI's survived this plunge into\nthe deep end, the former travelling to Sidcup on Sunday, March\n3 rd, to meet Goldsmiths' College.\nT.C. were.not at full strength and\ntheir optimism was not increased\nby the large number of opposition supporters.\nAs expected the game started\nvery fast, both sides fighting for\nan early goal. With Basil James\nback at centre-half, the T.C. defence efficiently broke down early\nGoldsmiths' attacks, each time\nthe ball being thumped out hard\nto either wing. These tactics soon\npaid off when Colin Casemore\nraced down the right wing and\nsent across the ball hard and low\nto Alex Crawford who ran it into\nthe net. T.C. then took advantage\nof their position and continually\npressed the slightly demoralized\nGoldsmiths' defence. After 45\nmins. I.C. were three up, Casemore having scored from a narrow ang'e and Crawford just\neluding the goalkeeper from the\nedge of the area.\nWith nothing to lose. Goldsmiths' started the second half in\nvery vigorous form, but the I.C. defence calmly held them in\ncheck safely backed by Dave'\nLoftus in goal. In general I.C. were superior throughout the\nsecond half, but a stalemate\nseemed to descend upon the\ngame. The fighting spirit departed from the home team and\nT.C. were contented to retain their\nlead.\nTn the League the 1st, XI recently beat Goldsmiths' 5\u20141 thus\neasing the relegation danger.

Man in Winning Team\nSpeculation ran high over the outcome of the fifteenth Annual\nHyde Park Road Relay, run on the 23rd February. Leeds, having\ncome close last year, were a popular choice with strong challenges\nlikely from several of the other Northern Universities, and a possible London victory was the burden under which U.C. started the\nrace. Manchester, however, confounded all the experts by winning\neasily in a very fast time, giving them the Sir Roderic Hill Cup for\nthe third time in five years.\nA record field of 78 teams came\ncame before the starter on a cold,\ndr v day on which underfoot conditions were far from conducive\nto fast times. C. Llewelyn-Smith\nof New College, Oxford, next\nyear's 'Varsity captain, was the\nfirst to move to the front of this\nimpressive bunch as they ran\nround the first of the six three-mile legs. He brought this minor\nCollege team to the 1st changeover ahead of the fie'd, including\ninternational T. Schofield (Lough-go rough) and several Blues.\nDespite the constant attention\nof the Sheffield University run-ner, New College managed to\nhold on to this lead until the\nbeginning of the third lap, when\nthey were sunk by the bigger\nguns of the fancied Manchester,\nSheffield, Leicester and Durham\nUniversity teams. Ron Hill, international marathon and crosscountry runner, stormed into the\nlead for Manchester with an impressive run of 13 mins. 37 sees,\nwhich brought them from 8th place to a commanding 160 yards\nlead, which they were not to lose.\nJeff Greenleaf, who never ran\nin this race while at I.C., took\nover from Hill and held the lead,\nwith Sheffield maintaining second\nposition. U.C., who had started\nquietly now lay in 10th position,\nbut their deficit of 2 minutes appeared too much even for their\noutstanding runners, Pete Yates\nand the redoubtable John Farrington. By now, it was evident that\nQueens' and Trinity, Cambridge\nand Bart's Hospital would be involved in a close fight for the\nminor Colleges' trophy, the Imperial College Union Cup.\nManchester's lead was made\nunassailable on the fifth lap by a good run from D. Nightingale\nwho held a50 second lead over\nDurham with Sheffield hanging\non to third place. J. Whitton ran\na fine lap of 13 mins. 45 sees, to\nbring Manchester home by a large margin from Durham, with\nSheffield third. Mike Turner put\nin an astounding 13 mins. 35 sees,\nto ensure the I.C.U.

After a lot of push-ing, cursing and good luck rather\nthan good management, they and\ntheir equipment were all fitted in\nthe van. Meanwhile to the consternation of some and the\namusement of many, other mem\nbe rs of the Club, not satisfied\nwith the normal amenities of the\nUnion had decided to climb from\nthe first to the third floor of the\nUnion on the wire ladders to test\nthem.\nFour hours later we found ourselves travelling between white\ncliffs of snow up to twelve feet\nhigh until at last we arrived at\nthe barn where we spent rather\na cold night under the stars.\nAfter a morning lazing around\nin the sun we found ourselves, at\nmid-day, in old clothes outside\nSwildon's Hole. Those who\nhadn't been caving before wondered what they were in for, the\nothers had a superior air, all were\ntrying to hide their nervousness.\nThe cave was rather narrow at\nfirst with a lot of crawling to be\ndone but it soon developed into\nlarge chambers and long canyons\nstudded with formations. Soon a dull roar could be heard ahead,\nthe first big drop which needed\nladders. The diverted water of\nthe stream hurtled over the edge\nto cascade 40 ft. to the floor be-low- One members fell off whilst\nSPORTS DAY1963, WEDNESDAY MAY1 st CLOSE CONTEST ANTICIPATED\nSports Day this year will be held at the University of London\nAthletic Ground, New Maiden, Surrey, on Wednesday, May 1st. An official College half-holiday has been granted, so that no-one\nwill have excuses for not being there to support his College, and\nenjoy a fine afternoon's entertainment.\nThis year's competition promises to be even closer than last,\nwhen the result hinged on the\nfinal event. Guilds have already\nwon the cross-country team event\nfrom R.C.S.. and at the moment\nseem all set to repeat their success in the 3 miles, to be held next\nweek.\nIn addition to the team contest,\nsome very close individual races\nare anticipated, and very good\ngood performances will undoubtedly result. Bill Wood (R.C.S.), who was placed 2nd in the Northern Counties 440 yd s. in 48.9s., and won the British Universities\n440 yd s. title last season, may\nwell come close to or even improve his College record of 49.1\nin this event. The sprints also\npromise to be good races, with\nHarrison and Wood (R.C.S.), and\nJo Smith (C.&G.) who has made\ngreat strides since last season.\nThe most interesting race may\nwell prove to be the mile, in\nwhich two of the rival skippers,\nColins (C.&G.) and Wilkins\n(R.C.S.) will meet.This year Dave\nColins has managed to avoid\nserious injury throughout the\nwinter, and we hope that he will\nnow realise some of the promise\nhe showed when finishing 3rd in\nthe All England Schools Mile\nChampionship. Wilkins should\nprovide ample competition, since\nhe has a personal best mile of\n4 m.18s. to his credit, and has\ndeservedly acquired a reputation\nas one of the best milers and\ncross-country runners in the University. Close finishes are also\nexec ted in the half-mile and the\ntwo relays, while in the steeplechase Wilkins (R.C.S.) can expect\na hard fight with Chris Janes\nC.&G.). In the field events. Turner\n(R.C.S.) and Martin (C.&G.) should have a keen tussle in the\njavelin, while Nicholson (R.S. M.) and Asekun (R.S. M.) are favourites for the high jump and pole\nvault respectively.\nIn addition to the athletic\nevents, certain other entertainment of a diverting nature will be\nprovided. I. C.W. A. will have\nsome of their more talented\nmembers competing in a \"netball\nmatch\" against a team of Presidents and Union Officials. A Staff race is also being organised,\nand a tug-of-war competition.\nTRANSPORT & TEAS\nCoaches have been arranged to\nleave the Union at 1.30 p.m., returning by about 6.00 p.m., and\nteas will be available at the\nground. The cost of the return\njourney will be 2/6d., and tickets\nwill be on sale early next term. '\nThis year's Sports Dav is going\nto be an event well worth attend-ing. Make sure that you don't miss it by getting your ticket\nearly.\nclimbing down the ladder, but as\nshe was \" life lined\" she only fell\nabout five feet before the rope\ntook up the strain.\nSoon it was decided to return\nto the surface as time was running out. The return journey was\nuneventful except for the amusement caused by one member leaning back on the 40ft. ladder and\ncatching the full force of the diverted stream down the back of\nhis neck. At four o 'clock the\nparty wearily emerged into the\nafternoon sunlight. Soon all but\none of the other parties had re-turned. This party had arranged\nto go through sump I as far as\nsump II. (Sump \u2014 submerged\npassage for diving through). At\n6 o 'clock they still had not returned so it was decided to alert\nthe rescue organisation. The\nnumber had just been dialled\nwhen they appeared ou tof the\nthe rescue organisation. The number had just been dialled when\nthey appeared out of the cave. It\nseemed that first one member had\ngot stuck in the sump and then\nthey themselves turned rescuers\nand had brought out three other\nexhausted cavers.\nThe evening was happily spent\nimbibing in the local and swopping experiences.\nThe next day again was warm\nand sunny and so the morning\nwas again spent sun-bathing in\nBurrington Coombe and drying\nout wet clothes. In fact it was\nso glorious that only 6 people decided to cave in the afternoon,\nthe rest going for a walk down\nCheddar Gorge.\nAfter an electrical fire in the\nvan, a puncture and snowdrifts\nblocking the road the cavers were\ndeposited at their caves only to\nfind that one was flooded and the\nother was like Blackpool on a bank holiday.\nThe party arrived back in London in the small hours, tired and\nweary after a good week-end's caving(?).\nN.
