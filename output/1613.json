The script is often too\ndated to be funny, the story drags\nand more than half the cast is alive\nat the end. How boring. Luckily,\nnot everyone is a dull Shakespeare\npurist, and for this production of\nMeasure for Measure, the Young\nVic have spiced it right up. In a\nfantastically current multimedia\nextravaganza, Joe Hill-Gibbins\ndirects Shakespeare\u2019s sauciest\ncomedy to remarkable effect.\nMeasure for Measure runs the\nfine line between comedy and\ntragedy. A biting satire of religious\nvirtue (at least in this production),\nAngelo, left in charge by the absent\nDuke of Vienna, condemns the\nwell-meaning adulterer Claudio to\ndeath. With the well-established\nwhoremongers of Vienna outraged,\nClaudio\u2019s oh so virtuous sister\nIsabella is drafted in from the\nnunnery to ease Angelo\u2019s hand.\nWith more than its fair share of sex\nand sass, and dozens of allusions\nto the sword and sheath, Measure\nfor Measure is a wonderfully sharp\nriposte to religious prudity and at\nleast in Joe Hill-Gibbins\u2019 eyes, a\nwell-rounded \u2018fuck you\u2019 to God.\nA progressive, attention seeking\nproduction, Hill Gibbins offers the\nviewer a remarkable variety in his\nchoice of staging falling somewhere\nbetween a sit-com and a sermon.\nRomola Garai is outstanding as the\nwonderful Isabella and Paul Ready\nis a dark and dangerous Angelo.\nThe production isn\u2019t faultless but\nit\u2019s about as good as Shakespeare\u2019s\ncomedies get.\nMeasure for Measure is at the Young\nVic until 14th\nNovember.\nAi Weiwei in his awesome studio. Photo Credit: Royal Academy of Arts\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\nGuess what! Shakespeare\u2019s\ncomedies are actually funny!\nAi Weiwei at the Royal Academy\nT\nhe Ai Weiwei exhibition\nat the Royal Academy\nof Arts is most certainly\nworth going to. The\nartist\u2019s work is deeply political but\nat the same time very aesthetically\npleasing. What really leaves an\nimpression though is the tenacity of\nthe author in his mission to expose\nthe wrongdoings of the Chinese\ngovernment through his art. His\ndetermination can be seen through\nthe thousands of metal beams\ncollected from the ruins of a school\nand methodically straightened\nto illustrate the corruption of the\ngovernment which caused the death\nof over 5000 children in the 2008\nSichuan earthquake. Ai Weiwei\ncan be seen through this exhibition\nas a man who will do anything for\nhis art. He even shows the room\nwhere he was illegally detained for\n81 days by the Chinese government\nand the atrocious conditions he\nwas kept in. The exhibit shows the\ncomplete lack of privacy that the\nartist was subjected to during his\nimprisonment. In all the scenes\nthe two armed guards never leave\nhis side. The viewer watches all this\nthrough tiny windows inside huge\nconcrete boxes. This makes them\nfeel almost as if they were spying on\nthe events occurring inside.\nThe exhibit does nevertheless have\nlighter moments. The exhibit as a\nwhole is a mixture of the modern\nand the ancient; the areas dedicated\nto a more recent history of China\nare very political and often verging\non the macabre. However, the parts\ndedicated to the history of the\nartist\u2019s country seem to show the\nartist\u2019s positive attitude towards his\nown country and his strong link to\nit\u2019s history. A whole section of the\nexhibit is dedicated to sculptures\nconstructed out of ancient Chinese\nfurniture, one of which, a wheel\nmade out of stools, appears to defy\ngravity. The work called \u201cBed\u201d\nresembles a large wooden carpet but\nif the viewer crouches down they\nwill notice that it is actually a rolled\nout model of the Chinese border.\nAt the same time though, the\nviewer will see photographs\nof Weiwei calmly destroying a\nHan dynasty vase. The complete\nimpassability of his face in those\nphotographs is striking. Similarly\nshocking is the room full of ancient\nvases painted in bright colours or\nAlicja Bro\u017cek\nArts Writer\ncrushed to dust and displayed in\njars. The artist appears to try and\ninvert the idea of value, defacing\nand destroying items that would\ntheoretically be considered of value\nand at the same time constructing\njade and marble sculptures of\nobjects that would be considered\nworthless or even lewd, like sex toys\nand butt plugs.\nThe exhibition is the largest show\nof Ai Weiwei\u2019s work ever held in\nBritain. You can see the artist\u2019s\nThe Chinese dissident returns to the RA with some of his most powerful work yet\nAi Weiwei\ncan be seen\nthrough this\nexhibition as a\nman who will\ndo anything\nfor his art\nfighting spirit from the moment you\nset foot in the gallery. Every piece\nof his work shows so much passion\nthat it can be a little overwhelming.\nEven if you are not particularly\ninterested in the political aspect of\nthe exhibition, I would recommend\ngoing just as a reminder of how\nmuch a person can take if they\u2019re\ntruly determined in their \u201cmission\u201d.\nAi Weiwei is at the Royal Academy of\nArts until 13th\nDecember.\nRomola Garai next to an inflatable penis.

For Brian Eno, these\nactions of choice are what define art\n\u2013 anything you don\u2019t have to do.\nThe composer, producer, artist,\ninnovator and all round genius,\nBrian Eno has been one of the\nforemost cultural figures in the\nUK over the last forty years. The\nreluctant keyboard player for the\nlegendary Roxy Music, Eno\u2019s\ninfluence on the British art scene is\nphenomenal. Described as Bowie\u2019s\nmuse, Talking Head\u2019s catalyst and\nU2\u2019s fifth man,the artistic polymath\nEno brings his unique vision to this\nyear\u2019s John Peel Lecture, in memory\nof music\u2019s greatest DJ.\nFor this year\u2019s lecture, Eno speaks\nwith great care and consideration\non the ecology of culture. A\nresponse to the capitalist view of a\ncreative \u2018industry\u2019, Eno questions\nour current approach to the arts and\nspeaks with poise on the importance\nof art in our lives. It is an odd\nquestion \u2013 for some art\u2019s value is\nso obvious and ingrained that it\nseems like a pointless question,\nyet there are countless people for\nwhom art offers nothing. With\nthe classic definition of art that is\nunderstandable,but Eno\u2019s definition,\nwhich includes activities such as\nsport, appreciates that art\u2019s effect in\noffering an outlet for thought and\na safe space to encounter complex,\ndifficult emotions is not unique to\nthe traditional artistic endeavours.\nI admire the openness to Eno\u2019s\napproach and dwelling on it, it feels\nincreasingly clear. In consuming art\nyou learn a lot about the world but\nyou learn a lot more about yourself.\nWhether you enjoy theatre like I do,\nmusic like almost everyone does, or\nadmire manhole covers like Corbyn,\nthere is an individuality and a space\nfor ourselves which I\u2019m not sure we\ncould live without.\nThere is of course a problem. To\nconsume great art society needs to\ncreate great art. Individual genius is\noften given credit for the creation\nof great art, but it\u2019s clustering in\nhistory suggests otherwise. Scenius\nis the word Eno gives it and it\ndescribes the genius of a community.\nAn environment in which art isn\u2019t a\nluxury but a hugely powerful and\ncherished force. The Renaissance,\nBritish Pop Culture and the early\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\n20th\nCentury Russians \u2013 none were\nproduced in a vacuum, all were\nthe result of a multitude of tiny\ncontributions, an ecosystem. This\necosystem develops constantly, but\nThe Roxy Music genius gives this year\u2019s John Peel lecture at the British Library\nBowie\u2019s\nmuse, Talking\nHead\u2019s\ncatalyst and\nU2\u2019s fifth man\nit still needs each of its individual\nparts to function as a whole. As\nneoliberalism has taken hold, parts\nof the ecosystems functionality have\nbroken down and the result, the arts\nare suffering.\nInasenseitfeelslikeI\u2019moverdoing\nit \u2013 here in London the arts are\neverywhere \u2013 but we could be doing\nThe\nRenaissance,\nBritish Pop\nCulture, early\n20th\nCentury\nRussians \u2013\nnone were\nproduced in a\nvacuum\nso much better. As Eno reminds us,\nit is surprising the number of core\nBritish social institutions without\nwhich he would never have made it\nas an artist. John Peel at the BBC\nwho gave Roxy Music their first\nradio spot, the NHS, the dole and\nmany more. All these institutions\nare under attack and the arguments\nfor their reduction are always\nvery direct, but it is important to\nacknowledge the wider effect of\nsuch actions. In Paul Mason\u2019s post-capitalist society where automation\nwill increasingly take over, we\nneed to carefully consider whether\npromoting STEM subjects over the\narts is really the way forward. There\nis a place for both, but getting the\nbalance right is crucial.\nI\u2019ve gone off on one, I know. Such\nis the power of Brian Eno\u2019s soothing\nvoice. Speaking for just under an\nhour on the ecology of culture, I\nonly wish he had gone on for a little\nlonger. His approach is evidently\none sided \u2013 so is mine \u2013 but there\nis substance to it. What Eno says\nis largely predictable from a figure\nlike him, yet he speaks with an\nenviable grace. Whether you agree\nwith his words or not, taking the\ntime to listen to this year\u2019s John Peel\nLecture is definitely worth it.\nThe John Peel Lecture is on BBC\niPlayer until 1st\nNovember.\nBrian Eno in the leopard print with Roxy Music flashing their stuff in 1972.

    "content": "PAGE 27\nfelixonline.co.uk FRIDAY 16th\nOCTOBER 2015\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nBUSINESS\nB\nack in June, Twitter\nCEO Dick Costolo (@\ndickc) tweeted: \u201cWelcome\nback, @jack !!\u201d. He was\nreferring to Jack Dorsey, one of\nthe co-founders of Twitter. This\nenigmatic tweet, short even by\nTwitter standards, signalled to those\nin the know that Dick Costolo had\nstepped down as CEO of the micro-blogging giant with former CEO\nJack Dorsey to return as interim\nboss.\nLast week Dorsey was appointed\npermanent CEO and took to\nTwitter himself, announcing the\nnews with the obtuse: \u201cHello! We\nhave some news to share!\u201d followed\nby thirteen tweets covering business\nplans, plugs for his other company\n(Square, a mobile payments\ncompany) and the importance of\nfree speech. Having been side-lined\nas CEO in 2008 for the technical\nissues the site was experiencing, Mr\nDorsey is returning to the helm of\na technically competent company\nbut one that is struggling to reach\nprofitability.\nThe challenges Dorsey will face\nwere best expressed not by him,\nhowever, but by his predecessor. Mr\nCostolo, announcing his departure\nfrom the board of Twitter, tweeted\na five-point list regarding the\ncompany. Along with paying lip\nservice to Dorsey, he sinisterly\ncommented that \u201cthose banging\npots and pans outside Twitter know\nthe least about what\u2019s going on\ninside Twitter\u201d.\nThe \u201cpots and pans\u201d are being\nwielded by the legions of investors\ndissatisfied with the company\u2019s\nperformance since its blockbuster\nIPO in November 2013. After\nsoaring to a high of $73.71 in\nDecember 2013, shares slipped to\na mere $30.85 by May 2014 and\nhave been stuck in the doldrums\never since. The case made against\nTwitter by its critics is simple: there\nis no overarching strategy in place\nto take the firm forward. Investors,\nanxious about the firm\u2019s inability to\nmake a profit, rightly want to know\nwhether the company can turn itself\naround. The tweets of the current\nand former CEOs reveal much\nabout why the firm will struggle to\nlive up to its initial, extraordinary\nhype.\nConsider first Dorsey\u2019s\nmessages. Following his official\nre-appointment last week he\nwanted to discuss his vision of\nthe future. Constrained by his\nmedium, however, he was forced\nto break down his case into ugly\n140 character soundbites. Costolo,\nsimilarly, had to use five tweets\nto convey his none-too-complex\nthoughts.\nSuch misappropriation of the\nmedium, writing paragraphs of text\nas multiple tweets, goes right to\nthe heart of Twitter\u2019s problem. The\nconcept was born nearly ten years\nago as a way of making haiku-esque\ntext messages public. It was not\nbuilt as a business. Like Facebook,\ninitial excitement centred on its\nstaggering growth: build the user\nbase first, monetise it later. Unlike\nplatforms like Facebook, Twitter\nconstrained itself severely with its\nunique selling point, the tweet.\nThis uniqueness has propelled\nthe word tweet into the dictionary\nand the zeitgeist but is now acting\nas a drag on user base growth,\nshown by the prolonged plateau\nin monthly active users (Twitter\u2019s\npreferred metric of success).Twitter\nhas primarily relied on a small\nfraction of users clicking on paid\nadvertisements (much like Google)\nto make it money. If the number of\nusers is constant and the revenue\nyou are making today doesn\u2019t offset\nyour costs then there is an obvious\nproblem.\nTo deal with this issue Twitter\nhas two choices. It can increase\nthe money it makes off its users or\nincrease user base. The first route is\na dangerous path for companies that\noffer esoteric services like Twitter;\nobtrusive adverts or shameless\nmoney-making ploys will simply\npush users onto other platforms.\nOther attempts to bolt on moneymaking services in the past have\nequally failed, for example a\npayment system called TwitPay was\nquietly sold for a mere $100,000 in\n2010.\nAlternatively, Twitter can increase\nthe number of active users. To\nthat end Mr. Dorsey announced\nlast week a new feature in Twitter:\nmoments. These are smartly linked\nup tweets, pictures and videos\ngathered under headings like recent\nsports events and the like. Wouldbe users, put off by the difficulty of\nfinding interesting tweets amongst\nthe dross will instead read tweets\nwithin these Moments. It is a smart\nservice and, aside from the bizarre\nchoice of not launching the service\non iOS in addition to Android and\nDesktop (presumably it will come\nin time), it will interest some people\nfor a time at least.\nYet it is highly derivative of\nother services that don\u2019t require\nsubscription to the arcane world\nof Twitter. Snapchat, an app for\nsending short-lived images and\nvideos to friends, has already added\njust such a feature. This almost\nidentical service, found under the\ncategory Discover in the app, offers\nSnapchatters the opportunity to\nread curated articles from news\noutlets along with video and\nimages. The service is effectively a\nTFW your hilarious tweet goes just over 140 characters. Photo Credit: Getty for Vanity Fair\nAlastair Heffernan\nWriter\nTwitter\nconstrained\nitself\nseverely\nwith its\nunique\nselling\npoint, the\ntweet\nOld dog, new tricks?\nCan Twitter\u2019s recently re-instated CEO, Jack Dorsey, do better this time?\nmore accessible multimedia Twitter\nfeed assembled by news outlets and\nwebsites themselves. This highly\nintuitive approach will draw in users\nto such paid content far more easily\nthan Twitter\u2019s Moments approach.\nThe fundamental issue of Twitter\u2019s\nrestrictiveness remains: formats\nlike Snapchat and Facebook have\nthe ability to create new features\nwithout alienating puritanical\nusers accustomed to a very narrow\nset of features. This not only\nmaintains user growth but allows\nthe developers to experiment with\nnew revenue streams. Twitter,\nby contrast, appears stuck in an\ninexorable Catch-22. Evolve and\nlose its key demographic; stay put\nand condemn itself never to turn a\nprofit.\nOf course theres a third way:\nif revenues cannot be bolstered,\nreduce operating costs. In fact\nMr Dorsey is planning to do just\nthat. This week, 336 job cuts were\nannounced. Such a move, ruthless\nbut seemingly necessary in the face\nof continued stagnation, suggests\nMr Dorsey may well have what\nit takes to improve Twitter\u2019s (and\ninvestors\u2019) prospects. The 2% share\nincrease in Twitter following this\nannouncement suggests the same. It\ndoes hint, however, that like me, he\ndoesn\u2019t think Moments will be the\ngame changer it was claimed to be.\nHe was\nforced\nto break\ndown his\ncase into\nugly 140\ncharacter\nsoundbites\n\n"

Eliot\u2019s 1949 play may\nhave started off as an\nordinary drawing room\ncomedy, but it soon\nbecomes clear that the cocktail party\nbanter hides more than just each\ncharacter\u2019s personal demons. The\nscene opens with a cocktail party\nhosted by Edward Chamberlayne,\nwho tries throughout the party to\nconvince his guests that his wife had\nnot simply left him but had gone to\nvisit her sick aunt. It was not until\nall but one of the guests had left that\nEdward reveals to a stranger that\nhis wife Lavinia had left him that\nmorning without an explanation.\nMore revelations follow, including\nthe tension between the couple and\nan affair between Edward and one\nof the party\u2019s other guests, Celia.\nThe stranger turns out to be a kind\nof psychiatrist which the couple\nand Celia visit in an attempt to sort\nout their choices. Each is presented\nwith a choice of either carrying on\nwith the status quo or going on an\narduous journey to seek something\nthat truly matters in their lives.\nThe couple chooses to continue in\nNot quite your usual cocktail party\nPrint Room\u2019s production of T.

There is always a dilemma\nbetween convenience and stepping\nout of one\u2019s comfort zone, and the\nchoice of the latter is a difficult and\npotentially hazardous one.\nWith a rather Absurdist colour in\na time before such themes started to\ninspire theatre, The Cocktail Party\ncelebrates the unexamined life in\nall its florid, Dior-clad detail. Said\nto be inspired by the Greek tragedy\nAlcestis, the play suggests higher\npowers at work,as we realise that the\nstranger-psychiatrist and two other\ncharacters, Julia and Alex, appear to\nhave known about the couple and\nCelia\u2019s struggles all along.

He went on record to\nsay that \u201cmost people could afford\nto pay \u00a310 if they wanted to\u201d. His\nstatements make it increasingly\nlikely that V&A will start charging\nfor entry. Currently, visitors are\nencouraged to donate \u00a34.50 each\ntime they visit the V&A, however\nthe average donation per person is\n\u00a31.\nThe V&A is not alone. Quietly,\nsome regional council backed\ninstitutions which previously\nwelcomed visitors for free are\nreintroducing entry charges.\nAmongst them are York Art Gallery\nand Brighton Museum and Art\nGallery. The former has introduced\na \u00a37.50 fee to grant access to its\ncollection which includes several\npaintings by L.S Lowrie.\nRegional arts collections, funded\nby councils rather than by the central\ngovernment have been feeling the\npinch for a while. In 2011, Bolton\nCouncil had to sell paintings from\ntheir collection to cover a \u00a360m\nshortfall in their budget. The\npaintings sold included works by\nMillais and Picasso. These works\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nAusterity means that places like the V&A could introduce \u00a310 tickets\nRarely do\nmatters of\nprinciple and\nideals hold\nmuch water\nin the world of\npolitics ... but\nfree admission\nmakes\nsense on an\neconomic level\nas well\nThe director of the V&A wants everyone to start paying to visit the museum.

Photo Credit: Huffington Post\nhave now entered private collections\nand are unlikely to be seen in this\ncountry again. At the time, Bolton\ncouncil\u2019s actions caused outrage in\nthe arts world. Bolton councillor\nStephen Pickup, argued at the time\nthat with public services threatened\nby cuts, and closures of care homes\nand youth centres imminent,the sale\nof art that would fetch thousands\nper piece was a credible option.\nChancellor George Osborne\u2019s has\nintroduced new plans to decrease\ndepartmental spending by 40%.The\nDepartment for Culture, Media\nand Sport is likely to be one of\nthe Whitehall departments to be\nmost hit. This will mean less money\nfrom the government going to the\ncountry\u2019s 700 national museums\nand galleries. These institutions\nwill increasingly be left in the fiscal\nwilderness to fend for themselves,\nrelying on money spent in gift\nshops, cafes and donations. In\nanticipation of budget shortfalls,\nnational galleries are unlikely to\nstart flogging away their collections\nto keep the doors open; for one\nthing, it would somewhat defeat\nthe purpose of opening the doors\nin the first place. In comparison,\nreintroduction of entry charges may\nseem the more sensible option.\nMuch like the NHS, which is\nfree at the point of care, having\nmuseums and galleries free at the\npoint of entry is something that is\neasy to take for granted. As with\nany generous policy, this leaves\nroom for abuse of the system. It\nmeans sometimes visitors go into\ngalleries to get away for the rain,\nand it means that some visitors\ndon\u2019t go the shop or don\u2019t donate.\nHowever, many more visitors do\ndonate. Most importantly, the\npolicy sends the message that as\nsociety we are saying, to quote\nJessie J, \u201cit\u2019s not about the money\n(money, money)\u201d. Free admission\nis investment in the positive effect\narts can have on young people,\nincluding broadnening horizons\nand improving mental health.\nCharging for admission\ndramatically reduces the likelihood\nthat students, young people and\nthose from more disadvantaged\nbackgrounds will become involved\nin the arts and may foster a lifelong\ndisllusionment and isolation from\nthe benefits that museums and\ngalleries can provide.\nRarely do matters of principle and\nideals hold much water in the world\nof politics,for all this talk on \u2018the big\nsociety\u2019, but free admission makes\nsense on an economic level as well.\nCurrently eight of the top\nten visitor attractions in Britain\nare national museums with free\nadmission. Three of the five most\npopular museums in the world are\nin this country.A visit to the Louvre\nto see the Mona Lisa will set you\nback \u20ac15; a trip to the Museum of\nModern Art in New York will cost\nyou $25. This country remains just\nabout the only place in the world\nwhere you can walk into a gallery\nor museum and look at a Picasso\nor Monet for five minutes or five\nhours and not spend a penny. The\nfree admission policy has made\na dramatic difference to visitor\nnumbers, in some cases by more\nthan 150%. Conversely, when Poole\nMuseum started charging entry fees\ntheir visitor numbers fell by 75%.\nWhen they reversed their decision,\nthe money raised from the caf\u00e9 and\nthe gift shop overtook the funds\nraised from ticket sales. The V&A\nfaced a similar situation when they\nflip-flopped on the issue a few years\nago,which should act as a cautionary\ntale for Alan Borg this time around.\nFree admission for national\nmuseums was established under the\nBlair government in 2001 and the\npolicy has become one of the few,\nalong with a free NHS, that has\nentered into political orthodoxy.\nSuccessive Conservative Culture\nSecretaries have supported the\nidea of free admission, and on his\nappointment the current minister\nJohn Whittingdale made point\nof saying it was not an issue the\ngovernment is looking to debate.\nAs the country faces five more years\nof austerity and the government\ncontinues to reduce the state, the\nidea of giving free reign to galleries\nand museums to charge what they\nlike will surely become tempting.To\ngive into that temptation would be\na mistake.\n\n"

I spend a lot\nof time helping clubs and societies\nout with their events,finance,or just\ngeneral admin.But I\u2019m also working\non improving the systems we use \u2013\nlike eActivities and the way that\nclubs get access to funding from the\nUnion, College and elsewhere.\nThere are a few Big Things. We\u2019re\nreviewing Student Development,\nand working with Sport Imperial to\nwrite a new sports strategy for the\nCollege.\nFELIX: How much do you love\nclubs and societies? As much as the\nnational anthem, or less than The\nGreat British Bake Off?\nBen: To quote my favourite\nchildren\u2019s book, \u201cto the moon and\nback\u201d. And if Vehicle Design have\ntheir way and get a cubesat built, at\nleast to space.\nAll seriousness, I can honestly\nsay that clubs and societies were\nmy favourite thing about Imperial\nwhile I was studying. They teach\nyou lots! Some things you didn\u2019t\neven know you didn\u2019t know. We do\na bunch of stuff (there\u2019s a statistic\nabout that), and it\u2019s really easy to\nstart new things.\nFELIX: Ben, if students want to\nset up a new club, how can they go\nabout that?\nBen: First thing is to contact me\nor India, the staff member who\nlooks after the new clubs. Then\nthere is a quick form to fill out so\nwe know you\u2019ve thought it through,\nhave plans, a budget etc. You\u2019ll meet\nwith the New Activities Committee\n\u2013 about five or six students from\ndifferent club backgrounds, and\nthen we\u2019ll put you into the New\nActivities Incubator. That\u2019s a thing\nwe use to offer you some more\nsupport as you get started, and it\u2019s\nset up so you should become a full\nclub within a term of going in.\nFELIX: Ben, what about if\nsomeone\u2019s having trouble with a\nclub they run? Who they gonna\ncall?\nBen: It depends! We\u2019ve got so\nmany clubs that there are quite\na few staff for different things.\nBut anybody out of me, Chris,\nthe Deputy President (Finance &\nServices), or the Student Activities\nTeam should be able to give them\nan answer \u2013 or be able to find one\nwithin a few days.\nEvery club who comes to one of\nour induction sessions meets a staff\nmember who\u2019s their assigned contact\nfor the year ahead and can help with\nany query \u2013 finance,democracy,how\nto make a claim.\nFELIX: Oh, okay, I thought you\nmight say Ghostbusters. Finally, why\nare you making me do situps while I\nconduct this interview?\nBen: It\u2019s important to do situps\nwhenever you interview. It helps the\nflow of questions by making sure\nyou have to break every so often.\nBesides, otherwise I\u2019d be lonely.\nSuper awkward to be doing situps\nby yourself when you\u2019re chatting to\nsomeone.\n\n"

The two current front-runners, Donald Trump and Ben\nCarson, have shown that a sizable\nproportion of right-wing Americans\nhave grown disillusioned with\nconventional politics and career\npoliticians. In this political climate,\nit wasn\u2019t massively surprising when\nKanye West announced he would\nrun for President in 2020, at this\nyear\u2019s VMAs.\nWhilst Trump and Carson\u2019s\ncelebrity appeal seems to have\nplayed a part in their success, it\u2019s the\n\u201chonest\u201d politics that they\u2019ve both\nbeen promoting that Kanye will\nhope to emulate the most. Whether\nhe has the ability to connect with\nAmericans in the same way that\nothers have done is questionable,but\nhe does have a certain confidence\nin himself (particularly in his\nimpressive body of work) that few\nof his future contemporaries could\never aim to reproduce.The tweets he\ncomes out with aren\u2019t far from the\nnonsensical and often contentious\nwords that are unflaggingly excreted\nfrom the hole in Donald Trump\u2019s\nleathered face \u2013 so it would be unfair\nto dismiss his candidacy completely.\nKanye has endorsed the\nDemocratic party a number of\ntimes in the past, so one might\nassumption that he would run on\nsome sort of progressive platform,\nalthough (confusingly) in recent\nweeks he has praised Ben Carson, a\npolitician whose views are somehow\nRace and Class\nI would once have argued that\nrace would be Kanye\u2019s biggest\ntalking point \u2013 it\u2019s a recurring\ntheme throughout his lyrics and in\nhis public appearances.He famously\nclaimed live on-air, during a benefit\nconcert for Hurricane Katrina relief\nin 2005, that \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t\ncare about black people.\u201d Yet now\nhe claims racism is no longer a\nproblem in America; in his opinion,\na single black president and his own\npersonal success (and the success of\nhis peers) prove that discrimination\nbased on race isn\u2019t really a thing.\nApparently, the real issue is class,\nand people inviting you to dinners\njust to laugh at your teeth. It\u2019s hard\nnot to feel sorry for a man with a\nfortune of over $100 million who\nisn\u2019t being included and respected in\nthe way he wants. Through his rise\nto the top he has grown incredibly\nself-absorbed, which he even\nadmits himself: \u201cI embody every\ncharacteristic of the egotistic.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worrying that he\u2019s starting to\nlose touch with the reality of Black\nAmerica; classism is obviously a\nproblem but deep-rooted prejudices\nagainst the black community\nmust be solved first rather than\ncompletely ignored.\nIncome Inequality\nYe has little to say about income\ninequality or the greed of corporate\nAmerica, which isn\u2019t surprising for\na man who charges thousands of\ndollars for torn grey sweaters. He\ndid once show up in support of the\nOccupy Wall Street movement,\nresulting in a rather awkward\ninterview in which he nodded along\nquietly as fellow activist Russell\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nSimmons explained his position.\nMore recently, he tweeted his\ndisapproval of exploitative mobile\ngames: \u201cFuck any game company\nthat puts in-app purchases on\nkids games!!!\u201d Just last year, the\nEuropean Commission introduced\nmeasures to protect children from\nin-app purchases \u2013 could we see\nPresident West doing something\neven more shameless and idiotic\nthan Trump\u2019s, saying: \u201cThis is the\nmost brilliant guy.\u201d Oh, Kanye.\nKanye\u2019s political positions are\nparticularly difficult to discern.

Maybe not if Kim has\nany say in the matter \u2013 with her\napp, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,\nbringing in over $200 million in\nrevenue last year.\nForeign Affairs\nHis position on foreign affairs\nis slightly less confusing.

Photo Credit: Cale Tilford\nKanye\u2019s first tweet as leader of the free world. Photo Credit: Not Actually Twitter\nOne Nation Under Yeezus \u2013 A Guide to the Politics of Kanye West\nFelix\u2019s deputy expert on the world\u2019s favourite rockstar predicts the possible policies of the 2020 West Adminstration\nHowever, there\u2019s the slight worry\nthat he might have a fetish for\nglobal nuclear devastation \u2013 as is the\nonly situation in which his weirdly\nwould have hoped, and last year\nhe even applied to fashion school:\n\u201cI wanted to go to Central Saint\nMartins, but Louise Goldin said\nthat I was too famous.\u201d Maybe he\u2019ll\nintroduce fashion school legislation\nto introduce quotas for self-loving\nmulti-millionaires.\nThe Political Class\nIt\u2019s also important to consider how\nKanye would fit into the political\nestablishment in Washington.\nMajor political figures haven\u2019t\ntotally dismissed his aspirations;\nboth Hillary Clinton and Obama\nmentioned him this week, with\nthe former recommending that\n\u201che might want to wait beause\nI\u2019ll be running for reelection.\u201d\nThe Democrat front-runner then\nwent onto suggest that she wasn\u2019t\ncompletely averse to Kanye running\nas her Vice President in 2020.\nIt\u2019s entirely possibly that Hillary\nwon\u2019t win next year or run for reelection in 2020, so Ye might want\nconsider who he would choose as\nhis running mate. Arguably, the\nmost obvious contender would be\nTaylor Swift. Their relationship has\ncome a long way since the infamous\n2009 VMAs. Last month, Swift\npresented West with the Video\nVanguard Award, and Swift took\nto Instagram to thank Kanye for\nflowers he had sent. A Swift/West\nalliance could be unstoppable.\nI\u2019m not sure that Kanye really\nunderstands politics, or what it\nmeans to be a politician in America.\nThe Citizens United case in 2010\nessentially legalised bribery, so if\nKanye is really serious he\u2019ll need\nto start making even more friends\npost-apocalyptic, hunger-games\ninspired clothes line would actually\nmake sense. Is this the beautiful\ndark twisted fantasy he\u2019s been raving\nabout?\nEducation\nEducation features prominently\nin Kanye\u2019s discography; his debut\nalbum The College Dropout reflects\non his decision to drop out of college\nin pursuit of his musical dreams\n(much to the disappointment of his\nmother).He\u2019s publicly advocated for\nthe modernisation of Arts education\nin the past, suggesting: \u201cPeople are\nso behind.There\u2019s poetry classes,but\nwhy aren\u2019t there rap curriculums?\u201d\nSo, it\u2019s likely that his presidency\nwould see some sort of overhaul of\npublic education.\nThe fashion establishment also\nhasn\u2019t been as inclusive as Kanye\nHe\u2019ll need\nto start\nmaking\neven more\nfriends with\nvery deep\npockets\nwith very deep pockets (he may owe\nJay-Z a few favours if he ever finds\nhimself sitting in the Oval Office).\nSo far this year over $400 million\nhas been been raised in political\ndonations,and in all recent elections\nthe candidate with most financial\nbacking has always won. After his\ninitial announcement that he was\nplanning to run in 2020, Kanye was\nquoted as saying \u201cI hate politics. I\u2019m\nnot a politician at all. I care about\nthe truth and I just care about\nhuman beings. I just want everyone\nto win.\u201d So far, so good.\n\u201cWhen I run for president, I\u2019d\nprefer not to run against someone,\nI would be like \u2018I want to work\nwith you\u2019.\u201d You\u2019ve got to admire his\noptimism, but in reality this naivety\ncould be his downfall. Everyone\nknows the Republican party won\u2019t\nplay nicely. If he does actually run in\n2020 (which I\u2019m sure will somehow\nbe aligned with the release of a new\nalbum), he\u2019s got a lot of learning to\ndo.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a world\nin which Kanye could win the\nDemocratic primary, let alone\nbecome become President of the\nmost powerful nation on Earth.\nThat being said, if Donald Trump\nwins in 2016 anything could be\npossible, and America\u2019s appetite for\nchange could be greater than ever.\nKanye\u2019s next album,Late Nomination,\nwill be released in 2020, probably.\nA Swift/\nWest\nalliance\ncould\npotentially\nbe\nunstoppable\n\n"

From next March we will\nsee a new design, which will still\nfeature women in provocative poses,\nbut unfortunately no longer fully\nnude.\nIs it unfortunate though? The\ncompany\u2019s chief executive, Scott\nFlanders,said the decision was made\nbecause we\u2019re all \u201cnow one click\naway from every sex act imaginable\nfor free\u2026 it\u2019s just pass\u00e9 at this\njuncture\u201d, and I tend to agree with\nIs it\nunfortunate,\nthough?\nhim. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019re not\nrunning short of,it\u2019s porn: a study by\n\u2018adult\u2019 website paintbottle.com found\nthat porn sites get more visitors each\nmonth than Netflix, Amazon and\nTwitter combined.\nAs iconic as Playboy is for\nbusty bunnies and barely-dressed\nbabes, this decision fits the trend\nof Playboy\u2019s pivot from their old\nreputation.Looking at their website,\nplayboy.com, you are greeted with\narticles like \u2018Check Out This Dude\nHandle This King Cobra Snake\nLike a Total Badass\u2019 and \u2018Someone\nTurned a 90s Sign Language Video\ninto 3 Minutes of Penis Jokes\u2019,under\nthe almost-too-self-aware heading\nof \u2018Clickbait\u2019.

Photo Credit: ITV\nJon Snow is known for several\nthings \u2013 his perennial presence on\nchannel four\u2019s news programming;\nhis eclectic and eccentric selection\nof ties worn during important\ninterviews; and his no-nonsense\napproach to interviewing.\nWhether it be annihilating an\nIsrael Defense Forces spokesperson\nfor defending the killing of four\nPalestinian children on a beach in\n2014, or seriously grilling Russell\nBrand on his view of UK drug\npolicy; Jon Snow is one of the\nfew journalists not afraid to tackle\nimportant questions even if they\nmake people uncomfortable. There\nwas also that one time he got high\nfor a documentary and had to\ncuddle a doctor.\nThe most recent display of this\nferocious tenacity was his interview\nwith David Cameron on Saudi\nArabia, migration and ISIS, in\nwhich Jon Snow brought up the\ncase of Ali Mohamed al-Nimr, a\n17 year old Saudi Arabian teenager\nwho faces death by crucifixion due\nto his involvement in protests when\nhe was 14.\nSnow confronted Cameron about\na deal done in November last year,\nin which the UK agreed to back\nSaudi Arabia joining the UN\nHuman Rights Council as long as\nthey reciprocrated and backed the\nUK.\nThis highlighted the hypocrisy\nof the Conservative government;\nsupposedlyagainstthedeathpenalty,\nand by extension the execution of al-Namir (although Cameron himself\nhas yet to personally denounce the\nsentence), whilst still consorting\nwith a country bent on carrying out\nsuch a punishment.\nIn response to Snow\u2019s question,\nCameron said this UN Human\nRights deal was struck because a\nfriendly relationship with Saudi\nArabia serves the interests of the\nUK. We \u201creceive information\nthat keeps us safe\u201d as a matter of\n\u201cnational security\u201d, and that more\nthan anything \u201cthe national security\nof Britain comes first\u201d.\nI\u2019m going to take a breath here\nand just emphasize this fact: our\ngovernment conducted a secret deal\nthat was only made public when\nthese documents were leaked and\nthen picked up by The Guardian.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s continued use of\nthe death penalty is far from the\nonly problem: It still uses extensive\ncorporal punishment, like in the\ncase of 64 year old Karl Andree who\nthis week has been sentenced to 360\nlashes for transporting homemade\nwine in his car. The country\u2019s\njudicial system still refuses to pass\nany laws to protect the rights of\nits 9 million foreign workers. The\nkafala system still in place grants\nemployers the right to prevent\nOur\ngovernment\nconducted\na secret\ndeal that\nwas only\nmade public\nwhen the\ndocuments\nwere leaked\nforeign workers leaving their jobs,\nor even the country, without direct\nwritten consent from their bosses.\nSaudi Arabia still places women\nunder a discriminatory male\nguardianship system which prevents\nthem from obtaining a passport,\nmarrying, traveling, or accessing\nhigher education without the\napproval of a male guardian. In\nshort, not generally a very liberal\nplace. Despite this, our government\nthought that they were a good\npartner to back for the UN human\nrights council.\nCameron\u2019s point, that we receive\nvaluable information from Saudi\nArabia that is essential to national\nsecurity,is one that neither I nor any\nmember of the public can know is\nvalid until the information is leaked\nor released in decades to come\nunder a Freedom of Information\nrequest.This justification seems like\na very thinly veiled excuse for what\nappears so obvious to this writer:\nMONEY.\nFirst of all, it\u2019s important to\nrecognize that Saudi Arabia is the\nlargest buyer of British-made arms.\nThe UK has sold Saudi Arabia 72\nEurofighter Typhoon aircraft for an\nestimated \u00a34.4bn, we\u2019ve upgraded\nSaudi Tornado aircraft for \u00a32.5bn,\nand upgraded 70 American made\nF15 combat jets for the Saudi\nArabian Air force in recent years.\nA large number of bombs originally\nintended for use by the RAF have\nbeen sold to the Saudi Arabian air\nforce to facilitate their ongoing\nbombing campaign against Houthi\nrebels based in Yemen.\nOur relationship with Saudi\nArabia is one that should be paid\nattention to - I personally cannot\nimagine a situation where as a\ncountry we can support these\nviolations of human rights in return\nfor whatever information we may\nreceive, or goods we can sell. At the\nmoment our government turns a\nblind eye, but I think that it is only\na matter of time before the British\npeople refuse to be part of this\npoisonous relationship.\nDespite\nthis, our\ngovernment\nthought that\nthey were\na good\npartner to\nback\n\n"

    "content": "PAGE 26 felixonline.co.uk\nTHE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FRIDAY 16th\nOCTOBER 2015\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nWELFARE\nI\nt\u2019s the time of year where,\nhaving just got back to uni,\nmost of us (especially Freshers)\nare seeking to let loose and just\nhave fun, partying and clubbing the\nnights away while figuring out how\nlectures work during the day. While\nthis is indeed the age-old student\nlifestyle,some aspects of it can prove\nchallenging.\nAll the social interaction, often in\nloud, crowded spaces with flashing\nlights and alcohol, can feel very\noverwhelming and sometimes\nlead to overstimulation or panic\nattacks. For those unfamiliar with\nit, overstimulation (also known as\nsensory overload),and panic attacks,\nwhile separate experiences,generally\ninvolve becoming overwhelmed\nby intense overlapping sensory\nstimuli, and can cause the person\nexperiencing them to become\nunresponsive, hyperventilate\nand freeze up, or shake violently.\nEveryone\u2019s responses are different,\nbut in general it is an unpleasant\nand unsettling experience, after\nwhich lots of self-care and calm is\nneeded.\nIt can be hard to accept that certain\nsituations, even ones in which you\nmay want to involve yourself, may\nmake you have that response. It\ncan also be hard to understand if\nyou haven\u2019t experienced it yourself,\nbut the key is to try not to become\nannoyed with yourself or others\nfor finding such atmospheres\ndifficult. We are all different, and\nsome of us just don\u2019t mesh with the\nstereotypical student atmosphere\nand lifestyle. And that is okay.\nAnyone who says differently isn\u2019t\nworth having around you.\nTo deal with my own social\nanxiety, I make sure I know most\nof the people I\u2019ll be with in the\ncrowded space, ensure that I have\na swift retreat if needed, and will\nleave as soon as I feel it getting a\nlittle too much. As the saying goes,\n\u201cThose who matter don\u2019t mind, and\nthose who mind really don\u2019t matter\u201d.\nIf you can, try to tell or bring a\nfriend who can help you get out of\nthe space if you need to; for some\npeople, if overstimulation gets too\nbad, it becomes difficult or even\nimpossible to speak.\nOften,though,writing or typing is\nmuch less difficult,so consider using\n\u2018Emergency Chat\u2019, a smartphone\napp that provides two-way text\ncommunication on a single phone.\nOriginally designed for specific\ncases of someone who experiences\n\u2018overstimulation\u2019 as a part of an\nAsperger\u2019s sympton diagnosis, it\nhas the capacity to help in the case\nof panic attacks, overstimulation or\nclaustrophobia.\nFriendly faces and crowded spaces\nHow to manage social anxiety when things get overwhelming\nAnother app, \u2018SAMApp\u2019, has lots\nof exercises to help get through or\npotentially fend off a panic attack.\nWhile these are good contingency\ntechniques and can help handle the\nsituation, it is equally good to use\nthe technique phrased by one of my\nfriends as \u2018flee, flee, run away\u2019. If you\nfeel like you are not up to dealing\nwith contingency planning and\nattempting to cope with crowds for\nthe sake of stereotypical socialising,\nknow that it is completely okay to\nsimply avoid the situation.Choosing\nthe time and way you interact with\nyour friends is absolutely okay,and it\nis often far more pleasant to interact\nwith friends in a environment that\u2019s\ncomfortable for you.\nIf you have a friend who has told\nyou they suffer from social anxiety,\npanic attacks or overstimulation\nthen it can be tricky to know what\nyou can do to help. From my own\nexperience, the most helpful things\ncan be simply listening to what they\nask and have to say, giving them\nspace when needed and reassuring\nthem that or wanting to leave a\nsituation is completely okay. Simply\nbeing there for them and letting\nthem know that it\u2019s okay to feel that\nway means a great deal.\nIf you are experiencing any social anxiety, friends can be there to support you.

Do we\nsmear our blood across some ancient\ncollege relic, like the plethora of\nalumni before us, so we are now\nblood bound to Imperial? Do I lose\nmy right to graduate if I fall over\non stage? These are all extremely\nimportant questions, which are\nkeeping me awake at night.The fact\nthat college hasn\u2019t clarified any of\nthese pressing enquires for me (not\nthat I\u2019ve asked, but seeing as they\npride themselves on being a top\ninstitution, they should really pre-empt), means I\u2019m literally walking\ninto a minefield, blind. Yes, literally.\nSecondly, I can\u2019t be arsed to see\n90% of my course mates again.\nNo, I\u2019m not being a miserable\ngit, but I just cannae be arsed.

I\u2019m\nso worried I\u2019m going to look more\nVoldemort\u2019s secret than Victoria\u2019s;\nthose three/four/six years boil\ndown to that one photo; tying the\nodd objects on the mantelpiece\ntogether.

I\u2019m totally\nfucking over it, yeah? I\u2019m sure you\nare too, so stop bringing it up.\nTangent noted, back on topic.\nWith graduation day round the\ncorner,let me highlight to y\u2019all a few\nof my woes, which I have no doubt\nyou share.\nSo you\u2019ve worked hard, and if\nyou\u2019re a medic, played harder.

Their\nloss to Japan would suggest not.\nAfter that initial setback they have\nimproved considerably, but I haven\u2019t\nyet seen a full 80 minutes of them\nplaying their best.\nWales have had an incredible\nnumber of injures to deal with, and\ncouldn\u2019t get through Australia\u2019s\ndefence in their last game. Both\nsides have game winners and\ngood packs. For Wales to win they\nprobably need to get an early lead\nand channel the spirit they showed\nin their game against England.\nSouth Africa need to be superior\nin the physical battle and their\nyoung players need to perform,\nwhile being led by some of the more\nexperienced players. I think South\nAfrica will win.\nNew Zealand vs France\nSaturday 20:00, Cardiff\nThese two teams have a history\nwhen it comes to Rugby World\nCup meetings. This will be a repeat\nof the 2011 final, when New\nZealand secured victory on home\nsoil. However, the Millennium\nStadium in Cardiff will hold better\nmemories for France, who toppled\nthe mighty All Blacks there in the\n2007 quarter-final. New Zealand\nare favourites, looked slightly shaky\nin their group stage games.\nFrance were playing well until\ntheir convincing defeat to Ireland,\nbut definitely have the pack and\nattacking threat needed to be able\nto beat New Zealand.\nMy prediction is that New\nZealand will win a close game,\npulling away as France tires towards\nthe end.They have many individuals\ncapable of moments of brilliance,\nand if Milner-Skudder and Sonny\nRugby \u2013 our predictions for the Quarter-finals\nHome fixtures: Wednesday 21st\nOctober\nBADMINTON\nMENS 1ST\nvs OXFORD\nWOMENS 2ND (MEDICS)\nvs KCL\nMENS 4TH (MEDICS)\nvs QUEEN MARY\nBASKETBALL\nMENS 2ND\nvs IMPERIAL MENS 3RD\n(MEDICS)\nMENS 1ST\nvs HERTFORDSHIRE\nFOOTBALL\nMENS 5TH (MEDICS)\nvs UCFB\nMENS 6TH\nvs TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR\nFOUNDATION\nMENS 3RD\nvs READING\nGOLF\nMIXED 1ST\nvs READING\nBill Williams have a good game\nthey should win.

They are a\nhard team to judge, beating South\nAfrica just before the tournament,\nand playing well in their defeat to\nNew Zealand. In addition, they\nthoroughly dispatched the other\nteams in their group, but they have\nplayed very little rugby against the\nNorthern Hemisphere teams.\nIreland also suffered significant\ninjuries, with captain Paul\nO\u2019Connell out of the remaining\ngames. If Sexton is able to play or\neven be on the bench it will be a\nmassive boost for Ireland.Argentina\nhaven\u2019t suffered badly from injuries,\nand their whole team looks\nimpressive. Although my heart says\nIreland,my head says Argentina will\nwin and break Irish hearts again.The\nteams are very evenly matched and\nit will be important for both teams\nto not fall too far behind, as neither\nteam has been in that situation so\nfar. I\u2019m struggling to come up with\na prediction for this game. In fact,\nI don\u2019t think I can even tell if the\nfinal score line will be close. Yes, I\u2019m\naware that that is a cop out.\nAustralia vs Scotland\nSunday 16:00, Twickenham\nAustralia should win this easily.\nThey looked very good when playing\nagainst top opposition, whereas\nScotland have only really impressed\nagainst a tired Japan and the USA.\nAustralia should have the advantage\nin the scrum, and in my opinion\ntheir back row has been the best in\nthis World Cup so far.

In a short article, that\ncould have come straight from an\naccomodation leaflet provided by\nImperial itself,the paper\u2019s \u2018consumer\nbusiness editor\u2019 described the halls\nas a \u201cstudent skyscraper\u201d, boasting\nof futuristic amenities like the film\nscreening area, kitchens with stone\nworktops and flat screen TVs.\nA whole paragraph was dedicated\nto the paint on the bedroom walls.\nDulux colours apparently, rather\nthan the \u201cusual white\u201d.\nThe article did, however, neglect\nto mention the 45 minute commute\nnecessary to reach Imperial or the\nfact that the building had been\nnominated by a local resident for the\n\u2018Carbuncle Cup\u2019,a \u2018prize\u2019awarded to\nthe year\u2019s ugliest building.\nNamed after Joan Woodward,\nImperial\u2019s second ever female chair,\nthe halls have been controversial\nto say the least, with the union\nbacking an \u2018#againstacton\u2019campaign\nprotesting the college investing in\nhalls so far from campus.\nOne victory of the campaign was\nthe reduction of Woodward room\nprices. Starting at \u00a392 per week\nand rising to a lofty \u00a3142, the rent\nis nothing compared to Beit (\u00a3216\nfor an en-suite single) or recently\nhiked Eastside rents (up to \u00a3262 for\na premium ensuite).\nWith the closure of Evelyn\nGardens and Weeks halls (and the\nformer re-opened at the last minute\ntwo weeks before term started) came\na need to house several hundred\nstudents.The college prides itself on\noffering all Freshers accomodation,\nand Woodward\u2019s 600 or so beds\nallow this.\nThe North Acton halls had their\n\u2018official launch\u2019 on Wednesday,\ndespite the fact that hundreds of\nstudents moved in several weeks\nago.

About as\nfar as possible from her predecessor\u2019s\n#AgainstActon campaign, the\nunion president was in attendance,\nunveiling a ceremonial plaque.There\nwas some confusion when students\nwere given restricted access to their\nhalls during the event, begging\nthe question why this wasn\u2019t done\nbefore students moved in.\nFELIX has also heard that some\nrooms directly overlook next door\u2019s\ngraveyard.

While those\naround grumbled about the length,\nworrying about whether they would\nget in, there was one question on\neveryone\u2019s minds: will it be worth it?\nIt certainly was. The Lobster is a\ntruly brilliant film, one that \u2013 with\nits stellar cast, exceptional script,\nand bold, idiosyncratic themes \u2013 is\nsure to rank as one of the year\u2019s best.\nTaking place in a dystopian world \u2013\none not futuristic, but wholly of the\nmoment \u2013 The Lobster postulates a\nscenario in which human loneliness\nhas been outlawed; those who\nfind themselves single, whether by\ndesign or accident, are sent to The\nHotel, where they have 45 days to\nfind a mate before they are turned\ninto an animal of their choice.Their\ntime can be extended by taking\npart in The Hunt, a bizarre ritual\nin which the besuited guests take\nup tranquilizer guns and attempt to\ncapture The Loners \u2013 a gang of of\ndefiantly-single renegades who live\nin the forest.\nOur point of entry into this world\nis Colin Farrell\u2019s character who,\nfollowing a divorce, finds himself in\nthe hotel \u2013 half summer resort, half\nprison \u2013 faced with the prospect of\nbeing turned into a lobster, a choice\ncommended by Olivia Colman\u2019s\nhotel manager (\u2018most people choose\na dog. That\u2019s why the world is full\nof dogs\u2019). Colman\u2019s character plays\nthe dual role of matchmaker and\ncorrectional officer, like Cilla Black\ncrossed with Nurse Ratched, while\nThe Hotel functions like some kind\nof Butlins from hell: newly arrived\nvisitors have one hand tied behind\ntheir back to remind them that\nthings are better in pairs, and bleak\nskits are organised to emphasise the\nadvantages of partner-hood.\nFarrell\u2019s character\u2019s time at The\nHotel is marked by a series of bad\ndecisions, culminating in choosing\nto pair with a woman with no\nemotions (Angeliki Papoulia),\nrenowned for her skill in hunting\nLoners.Of course,it is a partnership\nthat cannot last, and the ill-suited\nmatch leads to some of the most\nprofoundly brutal scenes of the film,\nbefore Farrell\u2019s character flees to the\nwoods and joins The Loners. But\neven being alone has rules.The gang,\nled by the mysterious Lea Seydoux,\nlive by a code of their own, one that\nemphasizes the need for solidarity\nabove all else: flirtation is punished\nby slicing open people\u2019s lips,\neveryone dances solo to electronica,\nand the highest punishment is\nknown as \u2018The Red Intercourse\u2019.\nUnfortunately, while in their\ncompany Farrell manages to fall in\nlove with a woman (Rachel Weisz),\nwhose major attraction comes\nfrom the fact that she, like him, is\nshortsighted. This is a world where\narbitrary common characteristics\nare a prerequisite for a well-made\nmatch, a fact underscored by the\nclosing credits: Ben Whishaw \u2013 The\nLimping Man; John C. Reilly \u2013\nLisping Man. While such a concept\nmay seem far-fetched,if we consider\nthat OkCupid, branded as \u2018the best\ndating site on Earth\u2019, operates\non the premise that a series of\nColin Farrell and Rachel Weisz in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 film The Lobster. Photo Credit: Picturehouse Entertainment\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nThe\nLobster is\na romance\nwith a heart\nof stone\nThe Lobster \u2013 A New Breed of Romance\nYorgos Lanthimos\u2019 latest gem is a postmodern love story with deadly claws\nquestionnaires fed into algorithms\ncan lead to a perfect match, the idea\nseems much closer to home \u2013 even\ntrue love can be systemised. This\nfeature comes back around in the\nfinal scene of the film, which leaves\nthe audience reeling from horrifying\nambiguity.\nLanthimos has proved himself\nadept at creating completely new\nworlds. Like his breakout film,\nDogtooth, The Lobster\u2019s environment\nis at once immediately familiar, and\ncompletely alienating. As dating\napps like Tinder become more\nprevalent in society, and the phrase\n\u2018we met on the internet\u2019 becomes\nmore and more acceptable, we\nare beginning to enter a phase of\nhistory in which there is no excuse\nfor singledom, and an increasing\npressure for those who choose\nto remain alone to justify their\ndecisions.\nThe Lobster marks Lanthimos\u2019\nthird feature with writer and regular\ncollaborator, Efthimis Filippou,\nwho injects his trademark deadpan\nhumour into the dialogue, which\noften spills over into sheer brutality.\nWith this being the director\u2019s first\nEnglish-language production, there\nis a fear that the script would lose\nsome of the energy of his previous\nThe Lobster\nDir: Yorgos Lanthimos. Script:\nYorgos Lanthimos, Efthimis\nFilippou. Starring: Colin Farrell,\nRachel Weisz, Olivia Colman, Ben\nWhishaw. 118 minutes.\nfilms. This proves to be unfounded\n\u2013 while there is a certain woodiness\nwithin the film, both from the\nactors and the script, this is part-and-parcel of the film\u2019s experience,\nakin to a Pinter play in terms of\nunsettling off-putting-ness. At\nmany points in the film, the silence\nof the auditorium was punctuated\nby incredulous laughter, as if to say\n\u2018how can I be laughing at something\nso grotesque?\u2019 But Lanthimos and\nFilippou tread the line between\nhumour and repulsion with great\nease.\nThe Lobster serves to cement\nLanthimos\u2019 well-earned reputation\nas one of the most exciting\ndirectorial talents working today.\nWhile the film dips in energy\ntowards the end \u2013 something that\ncould have been perhaps solved\nby a more decisive hand taking\nto the cutting floor \u2013 the scenario\nthe film sets up is nothing short of\nastounding. Straddling genres with\nskill, The Lobster is a sci-fi without\ntechnology, a horror film without\nscares, a romance with a heart of\nstone. It is a walking contradiction.\nIt is the most exciting thing I have\nseen all year.\nThe Lobster is released on Friday,\n16th\nOctober\nWhen Marnie Was There\nDir: Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Script:\nHiromasa Yonebayashi. Starring:\nSara Takatsuki, Kamusi Arimura,\nHana Sugisaki. 103 minutes.\nW\nhile Studio Ghibli\nhas gifted us\nwith a number\nof adaptations of\nchildren\u2019s tales, they have clearly\nnever come across The Boy Who\nCried Wolf. For the last few years,\nevery announcement of a new film\ncomes with it the warning cry\nthat this may be the last one for\na while. While the creative heart\nof the company, Hayao Miyazaki\nannounced his retirement in 2013,\nhe is still working to create short\nfilms, and \u2013 after all \u2013 he said the\nsame thing in 1997. So the news\nthat their latest release, When\nMarnie Was There, is to be their last\nfilm for the foreseeable future, does\nnot fill me with dread; or maybe it\u2019s\njust wishful thinking, optimistically\nkeeping the truth at bay, for \u2013 most\ncan agree \u2013 that Studio Ghibli has\nmade some of the most technically\nimpressive, emotionally complex\nanimated films of the last half-century.\nBased on the novel by Joan\nG. Robinson, the film concerns\nAnna, a young asthmatic girl who\nis sent from Sapporo to the rural\nseaside town of Kushiro for her\nhealth; as well as her breathing, it\nseems that Anna is suffering from\nsome kind of psychological strain,\nlinked to the strained relationship\nshe has with her well-meaning\nfoster parents. With a talent for\ndrawing, Anna simply wants to be\nleft alone, eschewing the company\nof local children in order to sit for\ninnumerable hours looking across\nthe salt marsh at the abandoned\nmansion, overgrown with gothic\nsentiment.\nRowing across to the mansion\none night at high tide, she meets\nMarnie, a young girl of the OldTime-Europe variety (golden curls,\nbright blue eyes, pretty ruffled\ndresses), whom she immediately\nbefriends. What follows is an\nexploration of the role of memories\nand the imagination: is Marnie a\nCensored Voices\nDir: Mor Loushy. Script: Mor\nLoushy, Daniel Sivan. Starring:\nAmos Oz, Avraham Shapira. 84\nminutes.\nM\nor Loushy is a lucky\nwoman. In being\ngranted access to\nthe source material\nof her feature film Censored Voice,\nshe scored a coup for truth-telling,\nuncovering something akin to\na documentarian\u2019s wet dream.\nCensored Voices is a literal title,taking\nits name from the tapes of interviews\nconducted by kibbutzniks Avraham\nShapira and Amos Oz immediately\nfollowing the end of Israel\u2019s SixDay War in 1967 \u2013 in which Israel\nscored a decisive victory against\nits surrounding countries, despite\nbeing greatly outnumbered, and in\nthe process expanded its territory\ninto and past Gaza and the West\nBank. While the phrases \u2018territorial\ngains\u2019 and \u2018Israel\u2019 may not sit well\ntogether for many of us, the SixDay War helped to form the Israeli\nnational identity, going down in\nIsrael\u2019s consciousness as possibly\nthe most momentous occasion of its\nshort existence.\nThe soldiers involved in the\nconflict,which left more than 20,000\nEgyptians, Syrians, and Jordanians\ndead,and thousands more displaced,\nreturned home as heroes, and were\nlionized in the Israeli media. Since\nthen the story has gone undisturbed,\nwith the government censoring any\npotentially damaging evidence,\nsuch as Shapira and Oz\u2019s tapes.\nMade with other kibbutzniks and\nreturning soldiers, the tapes paint a\nvery different picture of the army\u2019s\npsychological condition: battered,\nexhausted, forced to witness and\npartake in innumerable horrors,\nthe soldiers returned home broken.\nLike returning crusaders they\nwere welcomed back as liberators\nof Israel, who fought for access to\nholy monuments, but really they\nwere scared young men, a fact that\nLoushy\u2019s film delicately brings to\nlight.\nConsisting of the tapes playing\nover old footage from the War,\ninterspersed with clips of the\nsoldiers alive today \u2013 old men,\nwith paunches and squinting eyes,\ncompletely unrecognisable from\nthe strapping youth of the tapes \u2013\nthe documentary takes a scalpel to\nIsraeli history, revealing the truth\nthat lingers just below the surface.\nWhile the editing is certainly\neffective, there is the lingering\nfeeling that we still aren\u2019t hearing\nthe whole story; creating a film\nrequires cutting certain aspects\nof the speech, arranging it to suit\nthe trim 87 minute runtime, and I\nam sure that there are hours upon\nhours of extra tapes that Loushy\nwas unable to use. Understandable,\nsince to be crushed under the sheer\nweight of an untold history is not a\npleasant experience, but one hopes\nthat transcripts of the tapes will be\nreleased, allowing us to explore the\nentire story at our own pace.\nThere is also an imbalance, for me\nat least, in terms of what footage\nLoushy has used: while old news\nfootage is certainly invaluable in\nallowing us to understand how the\nsoldiers were lionised by the public,\nCensoredVoices is at its most powerful\nwhen we see the men listening to\nthe tapes, their facial expressions\n\u2013 nuanced in the way that only\ntrue reactions can be \u2013 revealing\nthe emotions going on inside. The\nsound of tired men being listened to\nnearly half a century later by those\nsame men, still tired, still fighting,\nshows perfectly the running thread\nof truth that stitches us neatly to our\npasts.\nWhile\nLoushy\u2019s\nediting is\neffective,\nthere is the\nsense that\nwe don\u2019t\nhear the\nwhole story.\nreal person?

These\nthemes, along with the strong\nindication that Anna has some\nkind of anxiety/depressive disorder,\nmakes this heavy-hitting stuff \u2013 the\nidea of exploring the mansion of\nher imagination makes me think of\na child-friendly remake of Jacques\nRivette\u2019s Celine and Julie Go Boating\n\u2013 but it is a pity that director\nHiromasa Yonebayashi doesn\u2019t\nfollow up this initial promise.\nInstead all the loose ends of When\nMarnie Was There are tied up very\nneatly, with a near-implausible\nfamily revelation discovered at the\nend of the film.

After\nthat, I taught Physics in a school\nfor two years and then spent three\nyears at a joint French-GermanBritish nuclear reactor in Grenoble,\ndoing research using neutron beams\nto investigate materials \u2013 mainly\npolymers. After that I was recruited\nto Imperial as a lecturer, and have\nbeen here ever since. That was back\nin 1976, and I\u2019ve never worked\nanywhere else, apart from a few\nsabbaticals.Whilst at Imperial,I was\nDean of City and Guilds College\n\u2013 (now the role is called Consul\nand City and Guilds is part of the\nEngineering faculty) I stood in as\nHead of Department in Chemical\nEngineering for a year, and then\nbecame Principal (now Dean) of\nthe Faculty of Engineering during\nmy last full-time year. I\u2019ve also\nbeen President of the Institute of\nChemical Engineering.\nFELIX:That\u2019s quite an impressive\ntrack record. So you\u2019ve mentioned\nthat you\u2019ve been doing neutron\nresearch \u2013 could you tell me a little\nmore about that?\nJH: I look at polymers using\nneutron beams. So polymers are\nlong-chain molecules and are\nobviously full of hydrogen, and it\nturns out that neutrons interact\nwith normal hydrogen differently\nthan they interact with deuterium.\nIt\u2019s a bit like how hydrogen and\ndeuterium produce different\nNMR signatures; except that here\nI\u2019m looking at scattering, that\nis, molecule shapes, rather than\nmovements.Think of it as something\nakin to Raman spectroscopy (where\nphotons bounce off molecular bonds\nand gain or lose energy),except here\nwe\u2019re looking at neutrons and nuclei\nrather than photons and bonds.\nThis was a really exciting field to\ngo into back then \u2013 no one had done\nthe basic research, in fact controlled\nsynthesis of polymers itself was a\nnew area of organic synthesis that\nonly emerged after the war. We\ndidn\u2019t know how these long polymer\nmolecules behaved. We knew that\nin a lump of plastic there was no\ndefined crystal structure, but not\nmuch more than that. By mixing\npolymer molecules containing\ndifferent amounts of hydrogen and\ndeuterium, we could examine how\nthey moved.\nEventually, it was realised that\nthese molecules were moving like\nsnakes do: following their own\ncontours. I had the opportunity to\nwork with Pierre-Gilles de Gennes\n[winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in\nPhysics] a little bit,who was working\non a mathematical description of\nthis motion.Whilst doing a postdoc\nin Manchester before going to\nFrance I had beenintroduced to\nSir Sam Edwards. Sir Sam was a\nvery important in my life, and was\nactually the person who nominated\nme for fellowship of the Royal\nSociety.\nFELIX: What about your time as\nPresident as the Board of Trustees\nof the Union?\nJH: When I was first asked to do\nthis, I really had no idea about how\nthe Union was run.They hadn\u2019t long\nhad a new constitution and Board\nof Trustees, and I spent a couple of\nyears feeling very confused. Then I\nrealised that it wasn\u2019t just me \u2013 the\nUnion itself was a bit disorganised\nmanagerially, and the new structure\nwas really feeling its way. But since\nthen, things have been transformed\nfor the better by new staff and a\nseries of excellent officers. I can\u2019t\ntake much credit for this, what I did\nmostly was calming down people\nwho were rather upset in meetings!\nFELIX: And as I understand it,\nyour time on that board is coming\nto an end \u2013 how did you end up\nbecoming IOP President-elect?\nJH: Well, I knew that my time at\nthe Union was coming to an end,\nwhich meant that there was a bit\nof workload reduction there. I was\nalso coming to the end of my time\non the Royal Society\u2019s Education\nBoard, and in December I got a\ncall asking if I might be interested\nin taking up the role. I was the\n\u2018Council Candidate\u2019, if you like \u2013 no\none else was proposed, so there was\nno election. I\u2019ll be the Presidentelect for two years, and then the\nPresident for another two.It should\nbe a bit easier than it was with the\nUnion, as I\u2019ll have more idea what\nI\u2019m doing when I take over.\nFELIX: Have you got any exciting\nplans for your time at the IOP?\nJH: Well, one of the big things\nwill be our move to a new building\nin King\u2019s Cross from our one in\nPortland Place. Making a successful\ntransition to this new building is\nimportant: it\u2019ll be more spacious,\nand there should be more room\nfor outward-facing exhibitions, like\nthey have at the headquarters of the\nWellcome Trust.\nI also want to try and work on\ngetting more people studying\nPhysics, and getting \u2018physicist\u2019\naccepted as a profession.There aren\u2019t\nenough boys studying it at A-level,\nlet alone girls! I want to make sure\nthat there is sufficient awareness of\nwhat you can do after university.\nWe also need to make sure that we\nare relevant to young people at the\nbeginning of their careers.\nOne other thing is supporting\nteachers who want to do more\nexperiments in their lessons. The\nFrench Academy of Sciences have\na great project that they have been\nrunning for twenty years now, that\nproduces hands-on resources for use\nby students. The focus is on making\nsure that teachers feel they have the\nsupport they need when it comes to\ndoing experiments, and that they\nfeel that they are part of the scientific\ncommunity. When I was a teacher\nI never really felt like I was part of\nthis community, and I want to make\nsure that teachers are embraced by\neveryone. At the moment they seem\nto be a group who often get bashed\naround by governments \u2013 of either\npolitical persuasion.\nFELIX: What about the\nupcoming referendum on Britain\u2019s\nmembership of the European\nUnion \u2013 does this worry you at all?\nJH: Well, science is an\ninternational endeavour and there\u2019s\na huge European community doing\nscience \u2013 there was even when\nEuropean nations were at war with\neach other. There\u2019s a famous story\nabout Captain Cook being allowed\nto sail to the Southern hemisphere\nto observe the Transit of Venus in\n1769 by the French, even though\nthey were at war with Britain.\nWhether we are part of Europe or\nJulia Higgins is kind of a big deal\nThe physics professor, chair of the Trustee Board and next President of the Institute\nof Physics talks polymers, the union and Britain\u2019s membership of the EU\nDame Higgins was also a trustee of the National Gallery. This is what we in the\nbusiness call being an all-rounder. Photo Credit: Martin Argles\nThere\naren\u2019t\nenough\nboys\nstudying\nPhysics at\nA-Level, let\nalone girls!\nnot,science will go on.Being part of\nthe EU is manifestly not necessary\nfor doing good science, and there\nare a number of highly successful\ninstitutions that exist outside of, or\neven predate the EU like CERN and\nthe ESA. However, I personally am\nvery strongly pro-EU. The country\nwould look a bit silly stuck on the\nedge of Europe without being part\nof it, and it\u2019s clearly easier to limit\nthe power of Brussels from inside\nrather than outside.\nScience is a global endeavour,\nbut it\u2019s also strongly European;\nand within that the UK gets more\nmoney from the European Research\nCouncil than any other country in\nEurope. One would not wish to\nmake any move to lose that, but to\nbe honest I\u2019m more worried about\nwhat would happen if Scotland\nwere to leave the UK.\nFELIX: So finally, would you\ndescribe yourself as a chemist or a\nphysicist?\nJH: I want to emphasise that\nI\u2019ve come full circle, from Physics\nthrough Chemistry to Physics. I\nbelieve I think like a physicist. In\nfact, I disliked Chemistry at school\nso I daren\u2019t describe myself as a\nchemist. I still have a huge gap in\nmy chemistry knowledge when it\ncomes to organic chemistry. I also\nhave to be careful not to describe\nmyself as an engineer \u2013 I think\nI have a different way of looking\nat problems to my colleagues in\nEngineering though we collaborate\nvery well \u2013 perhaps for that reason!\nFELIX: Well, thank you, and best\nof luck with the new job!\nBen Fernando\nWriter\nWhether we\nare part of\nEurope or\nnot, science\nwill go on\n\n"

The\ninitiative, championed by\nEmma Watson and other famous\nfaces, is doing a university campus\ntour across the UK and France. A\n#HeForShe branded tourbus rolled\nonto campus, outside the SAF\nbuilding, where Imperial volunteers\nin #HeForShe t-shirts told students\nmore about the campaign and\nencouraged them to sign up.\nLater, the union held a panel\ndiscussion on women in honour of\nthe event, with the UN\u2019s Head of\nthe initiative, Elizabeth Nyamayaro,\nin attendance, as well as Martin\nUpton, the head of Imperial\u2019s\nUndergrad Medical School, the\ngraduate admissions manager of a\nconsulting group and the union\u2019s\nown president. The panel was\nchaired by Imperial\u2019s Provost, James\nStirling.\nHeForShe was launched in 2014\nto promote gender equality and\nin particular to engage men in the\nconversation on women\u2019s rights. So\nperhaps the fact that there were\nmore men on the discussion panel\nthan women, was not such a bad\nthing.\nLaunched by Emma Watson in\n2014, the campain has gone on to\nengage with world leaders, actors\nand now Imperial students and staff.\nThis year is proving particularly\npromising in terms of female\nempowerment, with IC FemSoc\nhaving organised a visit from\nCatherine Meyer, co-founder of the\nnew Women\u2019s Equality Party.Meyer\nbegan the movement with Sandi\nToksvig, and will be discussing\ntheir aims next Wednesday in the\nPippard Lecture Theatre at 6pm.\nThis is part of FemSoc\u2019s Feminism\nWeek, the timetable of which is on\npage 21.\nThe HeForShe #GetFree tour will\nalso stop off at LSE and UCL.\nThe UN\u2019s Gender Equality campaign appeals for support from students\nNo bar staff were available for comment, so we took this picture instead. Photo Credit: FELIX\nStudents\nare unlikely\nto be solely\nreliant on\ntheir bar\nwages\nHeForShe hits Imperial\nA\nt last Monday\u2019s Union\nCouncil meeting, the\nquestion was raised as\nto whether the union\nshould be paying student bar\nworkers the London Living Wage.\nAt the moment, student bar staff\nare paid the compulsory minimum\nwage for adults aged over twenty-one, regardless of the student\u2019s age;\nthis is \u00a36.70 an hour. With holiday\npay at 12%, the actual hourly rate\nstudent bar staff recieve is more like\n\u00a37.30.\nThe London Living Wage is\n\u00a39.15, and a policy change could\nsee student pint-pullers getting a\nbumper 25% pay rise.\nA union insider told FELIX that\nsince the union funds its activities\non profits made at the bars, if the\nLondon Living Wage was adopted,\neither drinks prices would have to be\nraised or fewer students employed\nin order to avoid making a loss.\nIt is widely agreed that the national\nminimum wage is almost impossible\nto live on without subsidy, especially\nin London. However, money earnt\nfrom working at union bars is\nunlikely to be a student\u2019s only source\nof income, since most rely on loans\nor grants to support them through\nuniversity.\nThe London Living Wage is\ncalculated by the Greater London\nAuthority every year, and is\nsupposedly the minimum hourly\nrate required to survive in London.\nThis calculation takes into account\nincreased costs of transport,housing\nand other essentials in the capital.\nOutside of London, the living wage\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nUnion council asked about paying students the London Living Wage\nThere were\nmore men on\nthe panel than\nwomen\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nIf Emma Watson was here, she kept a low profile.

It\u2019s a\nvoluntary scheme, but many large\ncompanies are not on the list, and\nit\u2019s estimated that one in four jobs\nin London don\u2019t make the cut.\nAt the end of the discussion at\ncouncil, although no concensus was\nreached, the Deputy President of\nFinance and Services, Chris Kaye,\nsaid he was happy to look into the\nissue.\n\n"

This Tuesday though, we all\nhad the opportunity to celebrate the\nrapid expansion of science and the\nwomen that have pioneered in that\nfield.\nIndeed, this Tuesday we entered\nthe sixth year of celebrating Ada\nLovelace Day \u2013 a date dedicated to\ncommemorating the extraordinary\nachievements of women in Science,\nTechnology, Engineering and\nMathematics (STEM).\nIf by this point you\u2019re awkwardly\nscratching your head wondering\n\u201cWho on earth is Ada Lovelace?\u201d,\nfear not! I have put my honed\nresearch skills to use and am willing\nto provide you with an answer, but\nonly after I\u2019ve scornfully stared you\ndown and muttered something\ninsulting under my breath.\nSo who was Ada? Only a woman\ntrying to leave her mark during the\nmale-dominated Victorian era. Oh,\nand also the first programmer.\nOriginally born Ada Gordon in\n1815, she was the only legitimate\nchild of the poet George Gordon\nByron, more commonly known as\nLord Byron. Soon after Ada\u2019s birth,\nLord Byron separated from Ada\u2019s\nmother, who he\u2019d only married for\nthe money (plot twist!), left Britain,\nand eventually perished during the\nGreek War of Independence. The\nbitterness (who\u2019d have thought that\nwas the key ingredient to raising a\ngenius) of the separation ended up\nplaying a fundamental role in Ada\u2019s\nupbringing,as mother Anne Isabella\nNoel, in an effort to suppress the\ncreative \u201cinsanity\u2019\u2019 that she believed\ncharacterised Ada\u2019s father, infused\nher daughter\u2019s childhood with\nstrong doses of science, logic and\nmathematics.\nBut Ada ended up being so much\nmore than just her heritage.In 1833,\nshewasintroducedtointernationally\nacclaimed mathematician Charles\nBabbage and ended up developing\na long-lasting friendship with\nhim. She was captivated by the\nAnalytical Engine he had designed\nand, in 1844, contributed extensive\nnotes on its nature. Her humbly\ntitled \u2018Notes\u2019 (twice as extensive as\nthe original article they were based\non) contained algorithms that are\nnow regarded as the first computer\nprograms, as well as contemplations\non the true potential of the\nAnalytical Engine, extending to its\ncapability of producing music (yes,\nshe predicted Spotify, kind of).\nDespite Babbage being the\ndesigner of the Analytical Engine,\nAda\u2019s understanding of the machine\nand its capabilities, far surpassed\nthose of its creator\u2019s. Ada died\nat the age of 36 only eight years\nafter the publication of her notes,\nbut not before managing to attain\nnotoriety, with scandals including\na failed attempt at formulating\na mathematical model to ensure\ngambling success. I told you she was\na badass.\nToday we celebrate the 13th\nof\nOctober as Ada Lovelace Day, in\nhonour of not only Ada, but all\nwomen in STEM who, despite\nthe obstacles they\u2019ve faced, have\nmanaged to pierce through the veil\nof inequality permeating our world\nand still selflessly dedicate their life\nto expanding the island of human\nknowledge.\nFemale scientists were generally\nundermined, such as Rosalind\nThe famous Analytical Engine. And you thought MatLab was hard. Photo Credit: Science\nMuseum\nLef Apostolakis\nWriter\nAn Ode to Ada\nIn honour of Ada Lovelace Day, FELIX takes a look at the Victorian programmer,\ngambler and all-round badass\nFranklin, who was often patronised\nand called a fool despite her catalytic\nrole in the discovery of the DNA\u2019s\ndouble helix structure.\nWomen who sacrificed their\nlives for their science, such as Ir\u00e8ne\nCurie-Joliot, who like her mother\nMarie, earned a Nobel Prize in\nchemistry and paid the ultimate\nprice for her achievements, dying\ndue to exposure to radiation.\nThese are women who managed\nto accomplish amazing scientific\nfeats despite facing a discouraging\nenvironment deterring them from\nfollowing science; who refused to\nconform to the era\u2019s social norms\nand were smart, imaginative, and\ninnovative whilst doing so; who\ndecided to play with maths, science,\ntechnology and engineering.\nIf you forgot to celebrate the\n200 year long fight for equality in\nSTEM representation, worry not,\nfor there\u2019s still time. You can visit\nthe Science Museum every Friday\nevening for the next three weeks\n(16th\n- 30th\nof October) for a series\nof events aimed at deconstructing\nthe life of Ada, while having drinks\nwith writers, designers, scientists,\nmathematicians and musicians.\nOr, just recognise the contribution\nof women, not only in STEM\nbut across the social fabric and\nappreciate the challenges they still\nface today.\nLet\u2019s all drink to Ada Lovelace,\none of the first, but certainly not\nlast, mothers of science.\nAda ended\nup being so\nmuch more\nthan just her\nheritage\nProgramming on fleek.
