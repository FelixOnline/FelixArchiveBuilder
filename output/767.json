    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Wednesday March 11th1987 Howgate: Why I withdrew\nOver last weekend 1 went around the\nhalls asking students whether the\\\nwere aiming to \\ote. abstain or not\nvote at all.\nThe results 1 came up with,\ncombined w ith the calls I have heard\nwhen canvassing votes suggests to me\nthat there was a reasonable chance\nthat abstains could win in the\nPresidential election. The abstain\ncampaign was organised in such a way that neither Bill nor I were given\nthe time to fight it. or allowed to\nspeak out against it. I would at this\npoint like to protest to the election\ncommittee for allowing this to take\nplace at such short notice although I understand that their hands were tied.\nIt is m\\ opinion that the students are\nunaware of what a detrimental effect\nsuch a result or even just such a campaign can have. At present this\nCollege is overrun by apathy; a vote\nof a path\\( which this would be)\nmerely reduces the support, strength\nan j ability of the Union to motivate\nstudents into events and standing up\nfor themselves. A win for abstain\nwould mean that the election would\nhave to be rerun approximately 5\u20146\nweeks (note, this is very close to\nexams) into next term: any candidate\nlikely to stand would either know very\nlittle about the Union and hence be\nincapable of doing such a pressure job\nas President, or did not have the guts\nor commitment to stand the first time\n(obviously not presidential material).\nBill and I would be in no position to\nstand again having already been\nrejected once. The impression I get\nis that many students have decided to\nabstain either because they do not\nknow either candidate (unfortunately\nwe are not omnipresent) or because\nit is a trendy thing to do.\nSeeing that abstains could win\n(partial is my own fault for not\nanticipating this possibility and hence\ntaking the campaign too lightly) and\nknow ing what harm it would do to the\nUnion and the students I have decided\nto stand-down, effectively stopping\nthe possibility of this and handing the\njob oxer to Bill Goodwin. Having\nspent a lot of this year fighting for.\nworking for. and representing the\nstudents in this College I felt it was\nhypocritical for me to allow even the\nchance of this happening. 1 stood for\nthis post (whether Dave Jones\nbelieves it or not) because 1 felt I was\nthe best person for the job and could\ndo the most for the students. I would\nhave stood down had a better\ncandidate appeared or I had been able\nto persuade someone I felt was better\nto stand. Although I do not feel Bill\nGoodwin is a better candidate than I, he does know a lot about the way the\nUnion runs and how it might be\nimproved (even if he stood as a joke\ncandidate) because he has been news\neditor and an active student and hence\nwould do a competent job and at least\nbe better than any person who stood\nafter an abstention vote. I also feel Bill\nhas his heart in the right place. I would now like to apologise to. and\nthank all my friends and supporters\nfor all they have done in vain: they\nknow who they are: and say sorry for\ndisappointing anyone who was going\nto vote for me. Finally I wish Bill and\nthe Union the best of luck and success\nnext year.\nYours regretfully,\nIan Howgate.\nBitter experience of IC\nDear Editor.\nRecently, some civil engineering\nundergraduates wrote to the\n'Guildsheef to express their\ndissatisfaction about the way they are\ntreated in the department. We\nunderstand their frustrations very\nwell because we know the story from\nan insider's point of view, except our\nexperience is a lot more bitter.\nWe applied to study at Imperial\nbecause we were attracted by its\nruthless advertising which was so\nconvincing at the time. For those of\nus who came from overseas, we\ntrusted the image built up by this\nadvertising, because we had nothing\nelse to go by. some of us did not know\nany friends who had studied in this\ndepartment before. All of us now feel\nbadly cheated in many ways.\nFirst of all. we have to fight\namongst ourselves for office\naccommodation. I seems that they\ntake people on without considering\nthe problems of accommodation and\nfacilities. Once you are in the\ndepartment, you are commited to\npaying your fees and hence your value\nof being exploited has decreased, they\ncan start taking on more new comers.\nThe congestion got so bad that nobody\ncould work productively.\nSurprisingly, despite many\ncomplaints, nothing was done to ease\nthe tension. We put to a member of\nstaff that some students had already\nwarned their friends about the lack of\nresponsibilities shown by the\nauthority, and before long, people\nwould think twice about coming to\nthis department. Quite shockingly, he\nsaid lh at by the time this happened,\nhe would have become a professor in\nanother university.\nSome of the lecturers show no\nInterest in their students' work. Many\nof us do not get to see our\nsupervisors. For those fortunate ones\nwho do. they seldom get any advice.\nOften, the supervisor does not know\nthe subject. They claim they are\nworking on a fashionable field in\norder to attract funding. The lack of\naccountability comes about because\nthey know industry does not pay\nmuch attention to their fantasies\nanyway. All they want is to attract\nsome public funding to write a few\nacademic papers for their promotion.\nOf course there are those who are\nvery busy doing their private work.\nIt is a well known fact that the\nsections within the department do not\nhelp each other. Often, students are\ncaught in the political struggles of the\nstaff. Some of us are fortunate to get\nadvice from our good technicians and\nhence can complete the study on time.\nOthers may not be so lucky, they are\ncompletely helpless, it is unlikely they\nwill ever get their degrees, nobody is\ninterested in their work, nobody\nknows enough about their work. This\nis allowed to happen because there is\nno system to check on the\nsupervisors. They always say they\nhave got bad students, we don't know\nwhere or how to complain, we fear\nwe may suffer revenge.\nFor those of us on the MSc courses,\nlife is no better. We are faced with\nvery bad teaching skills. Some\nteachers like to use the projector so\nquickly that we cannot copy and listen\nat the same time. Projects are set and\nwe are left on our own without\nguidance. We never get a feedback on\nhow we have done in the project.\nMind you some of the courses don't do projects because the supervisors\ndon't bother to think of a title. On the\nother hand some projects turn out to\nbe consultancy work for the\nsupervisors and students are the best\nkind of free labour.\nAll these are only some of our\nproblems, but if they are kept secret,\npeople will suffer a lot more damage.\nWe hope the authority is doing\nsomething about it as a matter of\nconscience.\nA group of civil engineering\npostgraduate students.\n(Name withheld by request).\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nElection turmoil as Howgate pulls out at last minute\nWho cares wins!\nThe election for ICU President will have to be rerun next term.\nElection committee decided last night that the candidates for\nPresident had contravened election rules, and so the election\nwas invalid. In the contests for the other sabbatical posts, Chas\nJackson was elected as ICU Hon Sec and Judith Hackney is\nnext year's FELIX editor.\nThe decision to rerun the\npresidential election brings to an end\ntwo days of speculation, sparked off\nby the shock decision of Ian Howgate\nto withdraw. Mr Howgate pulled out\non Monday, leaving Bill Goodwin,\nthe only other candidate, returned\nunopposed as ICU President. Later,\nGrenville Manuel lodged an objection\non the grounds that Mr Goodwin and\nMr Howgate had each broken election\nrules by producing a joint poster. This\nwas upheld by a special meeting of\nelections committee, which was\nconvened late yesterday afternoon\nbefore the count took place.\nMr Howgate had pulled out of the\nelection in protest over the \"Abstain\nfor President\" campaign, which he\nfelt was detrimental to IC Union. He\nannounced his withdrawal in a press\nstatement which he circulated on\nMonday lunchtime. The news was\nbroadcast on IC Radio at 1.00pm, before most of the ICU Executive\nwere aware of his decision. Mr\nHowgate argued that the late\nemergence of the abstain campaign\naffected the way that both he and Mr\nGoodwin ran their campaigns. The\nfull text of his press statement is\nprinted on page 2.\nIn the objections he brought to\nelections committee, Mr Manuel said\nthat there was a clear breach of the\nrule which states that election\npublicity must not refer to any of the\nother candidates In his view both\ncandidates, by cooperating, had\ndevalued the election procedure.\nRepresenting Mr Goodwin to the\ncommittee, Sarah Allsop, his\nproposer, said that ICU Hon Sec\nDave Colley had permitted the joint\npublicity to be distributed, and that\nthe election had not been affected by\nit. The committee decided to uphold\nthe letter of the election rules, though\nthere was a general agreement that the\nspirit of the rules had not been\nbroken, and declared the election\ninvalid. Unless Mr Goodwin makes\na successful appeal to ICU Executive,\nthere will now have to be a second\nelection next term.\nIn an interview with FELIX earlier\nyesterday, Mr Howgate said that he\nhad discussed the position with Mr\nGoodwin when it became clear that\nthe abstain campaign could be\nsuccessful. He had suggested to Mr\nGoodwin that he (Goodwin) should\nwithdraw, hence negating the\nabstentions, and that if Mr Goodwin\ndeclined to pull out, he (Howgate)\nwould withdraw himself.\nMr Howgate said that if the election\nhad to be rerun he would be prepared\nto stand again. He added that he still\nthought he was the best candidate for\nthe job, and that if there was another\nNext year's sabbaticals (so\nfar): Deputy President,\nAlan Rose; Hon Sec, Chas Jackson; FELIX Editor,\nJudith Hackney Ian Howgate\nabstain campaign during the next\nelection he would run his own\ncampaign with a view to defeating the\nabstentions. Mr Howgate thought that\nhe had conducted his publicity in a proper manner, bearing in mind that\nhis only opposition had been a joke\ncandidate, Mr Goodwin. It was\nimportant, he felt, for the electorate\nto appreciate fully the significance of\nan abstention vote, and that this had\nnot been made possible because the\nabstain campaign had begun so late.\nHe concluded that he would like to see\nAB Stain made a full member of ICU\nso that he/she could be put forward\nas a candidate in any election, with\nBill Goodwin\nthe normal publicity rules applying.\nAfter the ruling of election\ncommittee had been announced\nyesterday, Mr Goodwin told FELIX\nthat he had not yet made a firm\ndecision over whether or not to appeal\nto the Executive. He confirmed that\nhe had discussed the effects of the\nabstain campaign with Mr Howgate,\nbut said that Mr Howgate had\noverestimated the support for it. He\ndid not think Mr Howgate had made\nthe right move in resigning. He was\nparticularly unhappy with the\nperformance of elections committee,\ncontinued on back page\nWednesday March11 th No.767 "
