    "content": "mE snBR fl in Tricky triangles\nConsider an obtuse triangle\n(that is, one with an angle greater than 90%).\nIs it possible to divide up any obtuse triangle into\nonly acute triangles( ones with all angles less than\n90%)? If so. how? If not.\nwhy not? \u00a35 prize for a randomly picked correct entry. Comments and crici sms welcome too, and all by Tuesday lunchtime please'.\nIt's confusing, man!\nLast week's committee meeting problem caused quite a lot of confusion. Most people claimed that\nthere was no unique solution or that there were ties, casting votes etc. Well those people were all\nwrong, the problem was quite easy if you went\nabout it the right way. I had two correct solutions and the winner of the \u00a35 prize\nwas Rachel Hill. Me chEng1. What most people missed was that if rule 2 is to be\nexactly adhered to, then\nthe seating arrangement must be such that the\nChairman( C) and President( P) can vote for\nanybody except each other.\nConsider rule 5, the P and C cannot sit opposite each other, since one of them would then have to sit next\nto the Ordinary Member( M) and would be unable to\nvote for him, thus\ncontradicting rule 2.\nSimilarly, they cannot sit\nnext to each other ( which a lot of people thought) since then one of them wold have\nto sit two places away from the Treasurer( T) and rules\n2 and4 would contradict each other. Thus they must sit with one person in between them. Following the rules through, this\nleaves two possible arrangements.1. Where0 stands for\nPublicity officer and S for\nSecretary, and the arrows point from who has voted for who.' In diagram1 it is not\npossible for anyone to get\nfour votes since P can't be\nvoted for by Can dT can't vote for himself or M. This leaves diagram2. Here P can't vote for C,an dT can't vote for M. Thus the only person who can receive four votes is O. The Publicity Officer wins the\nelection. Doors and Devils\nThe problem two weeks ago was to formulate a question to ask of a devil\nwho may lie or tell the\ntruth, so as to get the devil\nto point at the correct door out of four to go through. One of the restrictions was that the devil was only allowed to indicate one\ndoor. Several answers involved the devil pointing to three, and I disqualified these.\nMany of my friends claimed, at first glance, that\nthis problem was' impossible', but it really\njust becomes a problem in\nsemantics. The question must be phrased such that\nif the devil decides to tell\nthe truth it asks for the\ncorrect door, but if he lies\nit asks for the incorrect door so that his lie will\nreveal the right door. The only way to do this is to\nhave a self-referential\nquestion of some kind. Rather than go into more detail, I 'll give the answers, which speak for\nthemselves. Cave Canoe\nFootball\nThis is the second least-known sport played in\nBritain' said the President\nof IC cave canoe football\nclub ( ICC CFC) when he\ninvited me to join them for\na weekend's activities.\n'What's the least-known?'\nwas the obvious question.\n'Don't know.' He replied.\n' Nobody appears to have\nheard of it'.\nSo it was that early one\nFriday evening in January I found myself squashed into\na rather rundown Vauxhall\nViva heading along the M4\ntowards South Wales. It\nwas on this journey that I picked up gist of the rules\nof this curious sport.\nBasically, two teams of\nfive players carry canoes into a cave system to find a suitable underground lake\nor pool. They then mark\nout goals and compete with\neach other try ng to propel\na light plastic football\nthrough the goals using the\nblades of their paddles.\nLight is provided by\nt radi tonal caving head torches. The sport was\noriginated in South Wales\nby a pot-holing club from\nBrian who were becoming rather bored with simply\ncrawling around in the\nlocal caves. They founded\nthe Brecon Seals, easily the\nbiggest and most\ndominating club in the\nsport's short history. Our destination that evening\nwas Swansea University,\nhome of the only other\nstudent's team. It appeared\nthat this weekend was to\nsee the very fast U AU( unofficial) CCF Championship final. As our\ncars parked on the\nuniversity campus we were\ngreeted by gales of\nlaughter from our\nhosts/opponents.\nBAT Canoes( it stands\nfor Baths Advanced Trainers) are used by\npeople learning to canoe in\nswimming pools. They are\nonly half the length of\n'normal' canoes and look\nextremely silly. I hadn't noticed!\nCarrying the small and\nlightweight BATS was\neasier than I had\nanticipated. 'First\nadvantage' grinned Tony^ Payton-the man\nresponsible. After we\narrived at the lakeside , a couple of miner's lamps\nwere lit.' Only because you're a beginner' was the\nreason offered On my\nfirst attempt I lasted five\nseconds in the highly\nunstable BAT before I was\nhauled from the freezing\nliquid by Ian Pennington\n(President) and Andy Mason( Transport Officer).\nAfter five dips I decided\nto sit on the rock shelf and\nleave it to the 'experts',\nwhose minds are about as\nstable as their canoes.\nWhen Swansea arrived for\nthe match, bringing the\nreferee (a Brecon Seal) I looked forward to some entertainment. Alas no.\nJust prior to the 'flick off\nsomebody turned off all the\nlights except those\nstrapped to the heads of\nthe combatants (ref).Mike\n(Morris) Col clough, the IC\nsubst it ue tried to\ncommentate for 20 mins\nuntil he was forced to\nreplace Mark Turnbull (mild\nMarkO ram, of Chemistry1, explained to the devil\nthat a truthful answer has a value of 1, a lie has a value\nof 0, the correct door has a value of 1, and the\nincorrect doors have a value of 0. He then asked point to the door with the\nsame value as your truthfulness.' This question shows the logic of the\nproblem excellently and demonstrates that such a question is possible. It goes against the spirit of the\nproblem, since it involves\npreliminary definitions which the devil might\nignore, but these could always be made part of the\nquestion. James Dyer, of Me chEng1, and Neil Thornton, of\nMaths3, entered very\nsimilar questions along the\nlines of 'Indicate a door you would tell me not to go through, if you were the\nopposite in truth fullness to\nthat which you are now' The phrase' opposite in\ntruthfulness' is open to\ninterpretation, but the devil\nwill be merciful in this case. The randomly selected winner was MarkO ram, who now has to devise some cleverer questions to\nlocate who has his \u00a35 prize\nin the FELIX Office. The best question I could think up was 'if this\nquestion had been 'indicate\nany door not to go through' indicate any door you wouldn't have answered.' This avoids references to\nthe 'truthfulness' and the\ndevil has no choice but to\nindicate the correct door. concussion following a coll is on with as tale c tite). Ten minutes later came half-time when I discovered\nwe were losing 3-2 our\ngoals from Ian Pennington,\nwho was trying to impress\nthe ref a selector for the\nWelsh national squad). A series of test matches is\ndue to be played against\nthe touring Canadians this\nsummer.\nThe second half was less\nsuccessful. Ian scored\nanother but Morris was\nsent-off for dirty play\n(smashing an opponents\nhead torch). Meanwhile\nSwansea scored five times\ngiving a final score of 8-3.\nIC were jubilant however,\nthey expected to lose by\nten or twelve. The BATS were acclaimed as a great\ninnovation (by Tony), and Mark recovered in time to\norganise the ritual ducking of Ian in the water.\nAs we arrived back in\nLondon I found myself\nconsidering the minds of\nfellow human beings. Some people can find excitement\nin the strangest of ways.\n' It'll never catch on!....\nFELIX Friday 31 January 11\n\n"

His\nremarks afford me the\nwelcome opportunity of\nunderlining the general\ndifficulties facing this office\nover the maintenance and\nimprovement of College Residence Stock.\nThe un availability of\npublic funds, the dearth of\ncompetent contractors and\nskilled tradesmen , the high\ndensity usage of the\naccommodation coupled with the mis-use of\nproperty and equipment by\nthe residents are the main\nsources of the dilemma. An additional problem at\nEvelyn Gardens has been\nthe absence of the\nHousekeeper through\nillness which severely\naffected the on-site\ncommunication, co ordination and supervisory\nqualities. Given that this list\nis only partial, the question\nof priorities is in some ways the most vital one of\nall. The prime reason for\nconcentration on the\nexternal maintenance\nrepairs and re decorations of the Student Houses at\nEvelyn Gardens was to\nprevent further\ndeterioration of the\ncrumbling fabric. The\nsuggestion that external\nappearance is the priority\nfor expenditure is therefore\nsubstantially inaccurate.\nMay I also point out that\nthe observations made by\nMike Stone are typical,\nstandard criticisms which Iam happy to counter from\nexpenditure on Residence maintenance and\nimprovements. In 1984/85,\n\u00a3436,000 was spent on\nHouses as against \u00a3159,000\nspent on the Halls. The total spent on external\nworks was \u00a3130,000\n(Houses-Evelyn Gardens)\nand \u00a335,000 (Halls -Southside). The remaining\nsum was wholly expended on internal maintenance\nand improvements.\nConcerning the problems\nwith contractual labour,\nthere is little point in\nincreasing College supervision when we are\nsurrounded by so many\nself-appointed Clerks of\nWorks who appear to be\nexperts in just about every\ntrade in the building\nprofession. It is little\nwonder that the workmen themselves are so often\nconfused and bemused or\nshould I say amused by it\nall.\nI hope these few\ncomments, hurriedly\nwritten, will at least serve to\nencourage Mr Stone to\nspeak to his Warden, read\nmy reports on expenditure\nand improvements and also\nto follow the example of\nFELIX and visit this office\nto find out more thoroughly\nand fairly what constructive\nsteps are being taken to\nalleviate the concerns that\nclearly are so close to his\nown heart.\nYours faithfully\nPeter Hallworth\n2 Friday 31 January FELIX\n\n"

Nobody knew, so we just\nassumed that Martin, our\nwonder o us Captain, would lead the way. The weather\nwas perfect-well almost.\nThe sun shone brightly\nwith no clouds in the sky,\nbut it was a little cold. However, by the time we\ngot to the A3, a favourite\nCycling club venue, we had\nall warmed up and were\nstarting to enjoy ourselves.\nSo on along the A3 was it to be Guildford? Dorking? Nowe turned off\na few miles before\nGuildford and sped off\ntowards Woking. By now,\nthe traffic and carbon monoxide normally\nassociated with London had given way to fields and trees-lots of beautiful\nscenery. After Woking it\nwas off to Cobham where\nwe paused briefly to view a cy clo cross course, declining the invitations to\nride around the course. Then onto Chertsey, where\na friendly little newsagents\nshop was cleaned out of\nMars Bars and Coke in our\nquest to refresh ourselves .\nSoon we were off again through Sunbury and Kingston, arriving back\nhome at about 2.00pm. Overall, the ride was\nenjoyed by all, and we all\nnow eagerly await news of\nwhere we are going next\nSunday-if anybody decides before we set off!

    "content": "'Much More\nGenerous'\nBritain is much more\ngenerous' to its students\nthan other developed\ncountries, Sir Keith Joseph told MPs last week.\nIn response to growing anger at the announced2% rise in grants for 1986/87\nand the threatened loss of\nwelfare benefits, he quoted\nfigures produced by\nUNESCO, comparing amounts given out by\nseven countries as grants\nor loans for student\nsupport. The statistics\nshow that Britian pays\nsignificantly more (\u00a31367\nper full-time student) than\nany other country on the\nlist, ranging from Holland( \u00a3281) and the USA( \u00a3104)\nto practically no money\nhanded out by the\nJapanese government for\nstudent support. Also mentioned was the\npercentage of GNP spent\non student support.This\nvaried from 0.25% (Britain)\nto 0% (Japan). These figures, however, date from\n1982 at the latest.\nNUS Vice-President\nWelfare, Vicky Phillips,\nagreed that in many ways\nthe British system was relatively generous, but\nmade the point that 'This is\nsomething to be proud of\nrather than an excuse to go round chopping bits off it.'\nLeaders of the NUS have\nfor the first time been\ngranted a meeting with a minister from the\nDepartment of Health and Social Security, Mr Tony Newton, to discuss the lack\nof benefits. Previous talks\nhad been with ministers of\nthe Department of\nEducation and Science,\nand had been restricted to\nthe issue of grants\nregulations. TheN US has\nplanned protests against\nwhat it sees as Government\npolicy changes which have\nnot been fully debated, and warned that parents of\npresent and prospective\nstudents are being\nan tag on is ed. What Future\nWhat future can there be\nfor a country which won't invest in tomorrow?' was the question asked of over\n5000 Harrods shoppers\nwho were given leaflets by\nIC demon st;ator s last\nFriday. Around30 students,\nincluding ICU Deputy\nPresident Dave Kingston,\nattended the lunchtime\nprotest, which was organised by External\nAffairs Officer Grenville\nManuel.\nThe leaflets cited the cuts\nin lecturers pay and student\ngrants over the last six years\nand attacked the\nGovernments' proposals to\nprevent students from\nclaiming certain benefits. It\nwas stressed that money\nspent on higher education\nis an investment, essential\nfor the country's future\nprosperity.\nMr Manuel later\ndescribed the\ndemonstration as a 'general\nsuccess', adding that it had\nbeen very good humour ed and that there had been no trouble from the police.\nAlternative\nGreen\nPaper\nThe Comittee of ViceC han cell or s and Principals\nand the Committee of\nDirectors of Polytechnics have produced formal\nresponses to the\nGovernment's Green Paper\non higher education,\nexpressing deep opposition\nto the document. Both\ncommittees claim that the\nGreen Paper takes no\naccount whatsoever of the\nneeds of the nation in the\nnext fifteen years.\nThe Vice Chancellors' 'alternative' green paper\ncontains a wide range of\ngrievances, from the\nGovernment's 'blinkered\nview' and failure to realise\nthe scale of the problems\nbeing faced,to the difficulty\nof running autonomous universities while\nministerial and\ndepartmental intervention\nincreases. The paper points\nout that if funding is cut\nbelow a certain level the\nquality of the universities'\nwork will decline. It also\ncriticises the Government's judgement on many issues,\nfor example the raising of\nfees for foreign students.\nAnother item of concern was the low salary level in\nuniversities which leads to\nproblems of staffing and morale. The paper defends\nstudents' behaviour and rights, against adverse\ncomments in the Green\nPaper.\nBack To\nThe Top\nThe CB I is running a competition to find '21\ntwenty-one year olds with a strong point of view on\nhow to put the UK back on track to the top'.\nPeople who will be 21\nthis year are being asked to\nwrite 1000 words about the\ndirection British industry\nshould be going in. 21\nregional winners will be\nselected and each will\nreceive \u00a3500. An overall\nwinner will then be selected\nwho will win \u00a35000. Entry\nforms are available from\nany branch of Lloyd's Bank.\nFabulous\nFare\nHolders of the Young Persons Railcard will be\nable to get up to 80%\ndiscounts on 'Saver' fares\nas from tomorrow. British\nRail have introduced an\noffer designed to increase\nbusiness in a traditionally\nslack period.\nUnder the 'Fabulous\nFebruary Fare' offer, 'Saver'\ntickets which usually cost\nup to \u00a320 will be available\nat \u00a34, those up to \u00a340 will\nbe reduced to \u00a38 and any\nover \u00a340 will cost \u00a312. Low price tickets will be on sale\nevery day in February,\nexcept between 1200 and\n2000 on Fridays.\nFrom Sunday, BR is also\nreducing the charge for\ncarriage reservations on intercity 125 trains to \u00a33,\nand making more 125's available with this facility.\nExtra benefits are promised\nin May. Violence\nFree\nThe National Anti Vivisection Society has\nlaunched a 'Violence Free\nScience' campaign. The campaign aims to secure\nfor students the right to\nchoose whether they\nparticipate in dissection\nand vivisection. The campaign's organiser,\nLorraine Walker, explained\nthat many students were\nworried about the\nexperiments they were\nbeing forced to perform. At\npresent many students are\npenal is ed if they refuse to\ntake part in experiments on\nlive animals.\nRecord\nJump\nHigh Jumper Geoff Parsons broke the UK outdoor\nrecord by 4 cm last\nSaturday when he cleared\n2.30 metres in the Pearl\nAssurance National Indoor\nChampionships at Cos ford. Mr Parsons, a second year\nstudent in Mineral\nResources Engineering,\nwent on to attempt a world\nrecord of 2.40 metres and\nonly narrowly failed to\nclear the bar at this height.\n16\nFriday 31 January FELIX\n\n"

Why have those Christians\ngone to the trouble and\nexpense of making badges,\nprinting 2000 posters using\na small mountain of blu-tack etc? The idea is to\nmake CONTACT! With\nEverybody!\nWith non-Christians to\ntell of something that\nChristianity has to offer\nand to listen to criticism\nwith other Christians to\nlearn from other traditions\nand to grow together.\nTo do this 20 people\nfrom a large variety of\nbackgrounds are living and\nworking with students in\nCollege. They will provide a source to lead discussions and reflect on their own\nexperience to give help.\nThey will also be available\nfor people who wish to talk\nto someone they will never\nmeet again.\nThe hope is that as many\npeople will benefit as\npossible. As with anything,\nyou only get out of the\nweek what you put in-there\nis an open invitation to you\nall.\nThis week is organised\nby The West London Chaplaincy( Anglican).\nThe W LC represents the\nAnglican Tradition within\nCollege and caters for\nanyone within the Anglican or free Church communities. They have\ndiscussion groups in most\ndepartments and have an\ninformal service on Sunday Mornings at 10am in the\nConsort Gallery (ground\nfloor, Sherfield building).\nThe West London Catholic\nChaplaincy\nTheir aim 'is to build a Catholic community for\nstudents'. Like the W LC they are open to anyone who wants to take part\nusing the Catholic spirituality and Tradition to\ngrow as people and in the\nLove of God. Meetings\nevery Tuesday, Chemistry231 at 12.30 and on\nSundays at MoreHouse,53 Cromwell Rd. Also involved in Contact week is University Christian\nOutreach an inter collie gate interdenominational society\nset up to spread\nChristianity. Evangelical\nand friendly.\nBiathlons And\nTriathlons\nA little before Christmas a friend (sadist) suggested to\nme that I would like to\nenter a race. 'What kind of\nrace' It ent iv ely asked and\nbefore I knew what I had\nrashly signed my body\naway to the mercies of the\n-i rst Classic Biathlan'.\nHeld from a school near\nNew Maiden and consisting\nof a5 mile run followed by\na22 mile cycle, it was\nknacker ing. My exhaustion\nnot being helped by the\nlack of training (5-10\nminutes cycle to College and back each day of this\nterm.) and the days\nfreezing early morning\ntemperatures.\nHeld last Sunday, the day\nstarted well by getting up\nat 7.15am instead of a proposed6.00 am so that I had to forsake my relaxed\nbreakfast and relaxed 10\nmile cycle to the start for a quick bowl of cereal and a quick 10 miles cycle.\nOn arrival my hands\nbegan to warm up which meant extreme agony as I had no gloves on on the\nway down. Luckily though I found a sympathetic friend\nwith a spare pair to hand\nthat I could use during the\nrace.\nI laye d my bike down with the others, in the rows,\ntogether with the gear I needed^ o change into\nduring the transition\nperiod, leaving for the final\nbriefing 10 minutes before\nthe off. The run was an out\nand back route, along an\nA3 slip road, exactly\nretracing the outward\njourney after the half way\nmark. Because of this it\nwas relatively easy to judge\nhow far you had run and how much more effort you\nwould afford to put into the\nrun.\nBack at the school for\nthe transition point, it was\non with another tap and\ngrab the bike taking the\nleast possible time, before\nheading off on the second and last stage of the race.\nOver taking people at this\nstage as I did make me feel\ngood but can be a mistake\nit you're over zealous about\nit. As it turned out all\nworked well and with my\nego boosted to start with I came in 16th. Out of a field\nof about 250, the time on\nas yet unconfirmed 1 hour\n40-50 minutes compared to\nthe winners 1 hour 20\nminutes. He came in on his\nown and 6 minutes ahead\nof his nearest rival.\nEvents like this together\nwith triathlons (swimming,\ncycling and running) like\nmost sports are incredibly\nrewarding, especially when\nyou cross the finish line\nand collect your medal.\nThere is nothing quiet like\nthe feeling of crossing that\nfinish line after being such a masochist to yourself\nover such a time and\ncourse and it really is worth\nall the pain. So if you're\ninterested, whether\nseriously committed or not\ncontact me, Chris Stapleton\nvia the FELIX office or the\nAero1 pigeon holes leaving\na note if I'm not around of\nyour name, year, course or\nother means of contact\ntogether with an indication\nof your level of interest.\nJust What\nYou've\nBeen\nWaiting\nFor....\nRhino's Willies...(And other\nthings)\nLast Sunday saw the climax\nto the American football\nseason with Super bowl20. GREAT... go down the of fy, spend your last pennies on\na few bottles of Special\nBrew, sit yourself down in\nfront of the telly and enjoy\nthe thrills and spills of 'The\nRefrigerator' and the like.\nProblem; its 8.30, and it\ndoesn't start till 9.30. Well\nwhat's on now. Go for the\nevery popular 4 button-what s this?-some blok e in\na safari suit. 'Oh no-not\nanother Natural History\nprogramme!' No in fact 'Pet\nHates' in which some blok e rants on about how sordid\nand disgusting animals are.\nDid you know that when you over feed ducks, because they have so much time released from looking\nfor their own food, all they\ndo all day is copulate? It's a big problem for the\nfemale ducks to have\ntwenty horny drakes after\nher-(a bit like IC women!)\nDid you know that when a male preying mantis gets\nall keyed up and climbs on\nthe female praying mantis,\nsomething in his head\nforgets what to do? Solution-female bites his\nhead off, and the rest of his\nbody get on with it;-well\nthe bits that aren't being\neaten do anyway! (Which\nbit does she eat last??)\nBasically the program\nwas about this blok e who got incredibly pissed off\nabout Natural History\nprogrammes fascination\nwith copulating animals.\nWhich leads me to the long\nawaited bit about Rhino's willies...\nWell the point is, they're\nbig, VERY, VERY BIG. It's difficult to describe\nthe general dimensions without being disgusting,\nbut put it this way:- your\naverage female Rhino must\nhave receptive bits that run\nthe full length of her body.\nYou could stick your arm\nup there no problem. Oh this is sordid drivel-l 'll\nnever stretch it out to 400\nwords.\n10 Friday 31 January FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Ah me, the bracing wind\nand refreshing rain that this\nJanuary has brought are\nbeginning to lose their\nappeal, the enthusiasm with\nwhich I approached the\nnew term is beginning to\nfade, and my grant is, to\nput it m idly, dwindling.\nNevertheless, other people\ndo not seem to have lost\nheart. Instead of\napathetically accepting the\ndregs of the January blues\nsome( true IC students all)\nhave decided to make a little excitement for\nthemselves, by making\neven more ex c it ment for\ntheir (no doubt temporary)\nfriends.\nRose, Wilson and MelliarSmith seem to be the\nnames to watch if you want\nto see some tomfoolery\n(yes, the pun was\nintended). Within two\nweeks they have managed to bamboozle ICU President Carl Burgess, RCS Transport Officer\nPascale Carr and IC Radio Station Manager Cw is Martin.\nPete (I want some Durex,\nand I want it now) Wilson and Alan( you know I'm right really) Rose managed, after hearing about a similar offer from the\nAmerican Embassy, to\nconvince Mr Burgess that\nthe Russian Cultual Attache\nwanted a group of IC\nStudents to turn up for an\ninformal interrogation.\nWhat's worse, with the\nintelligence that made him\npresident, Carl readily\naccepted this offer from the\nmysterious Mr Du bly ok in, not finding it strange that\nhe should receive two such offers in the same day. Not\nonly that, but the cold war\nhot ted up as accusations flew from the Union Office\nthat the Soviet Embassy had bugged the Americans, inviting IC only because they thought the Yanks know something they\ndidn't. Luckily, an\ninternational incident and Third World War were\navoided when some kind\nsoul explained to Carl that\nhe had been (shock,\nhorror) deceived.\nUnfortunately, Mssrs\nRose and Wilson still did\nnot feel that they were\nreally fulfilled where\npractical jokes were\nconcerned so, to remedy\nthis, they teamed up with\nTom( sweetness and light)\nMelliar-Smith in upsetting\nMr Carr. Claiming that they\nwere from QM C and that\nthey had abducted Salty\nTom, they phoned the RCS office demanding Mary\n( Q MC's mascot) from Mr Carr. By bringing his\nbut this could not (like the\nNewsline story) be verified.\nPerhaps a nicer practical\njoke was played on a personage by the dubious\nlabel of Alkey. With\ncompliments of this friends,\nhe opened the door to his\nroom to find it had been\nwallpapered with pictures\nof the round wobbly things.\nA passing innocent\nbystander heard him ask\n(in astonishment rather\nthan anger, we think), 'Who\nwas the tit who put tits on\nmy wall?' But it is known\nthat (in order to catch the\ncriminals, of course) he has\ndecided not to destroy the\nevidence.\nAlso softened by\nwomanly wiles, Mines VP Chris Griffin was seen\nslobbering over an older\nwoman last Friday night.\nAfter meeting Kathy Tait's mother at the party to\nce lebar ate Kathy and John Inghams's engagement,\nChris was heard to whisper\nsweet-nothings in her ear.\nPersonally, I have always\nSimon Banton: Always the good loser!\nsweetheart (Jez) into the\ndiscussion however, they\nmanaged to offend him\ndeeply and like any\ngentlemen who has heard\nthe honour of his true love questioned, he sought to\npunish those rep on sib le. Indeed, after a particularly\nun enjoyable( sober) Firkin\nRun( yes, a Carr( ouch!)\nwas driving) Pascale went\ninto the Union Bar and\nthreatened the\naforementioned\nperpetrators of this\ndastardly crime with GB H( and we are not talking\nbeer). Undeterred, they\nproceeded to play the same\ntrick on Mr Martin,\nconvincing him this time the\nGuilds Hon Sec Dave Page had been kidnapped. After\nthe usual thorough IC\nRadio investigation, Cw is used this piece of\ninformation as a news story\non Newsline. Rumour had it\nthat he turned up at the\nappointed drop off point,\nthought that the older\nwoman/ younger man\nrelationship was a good idea (as long as it doesn't consist of my mother and\nmy boyfriend), but surely\nthirty years is a bit\nexcessive even for a sex-starved IC Student!\nAn old 'friend' of FELIX has reared his head in\ncollege again. An unsuccessful candidate for\nthe FELIX editorship last\nyear (who was so well\nacquainted with the post he\nwas standing for that he\nhad to ask a member of the\nFELIX staff.'How much work do you have to do for\none page?') was, while\nwatching the Super bowl in\nthe Union Concert Hall on\nSunday, helping an\nassortment of boorish\nmales to condemn FELIX as 'communist'\npropaganda. At the same time, he proceeded to\nextoll the virtues of FELIX as he would have edited it.\nFortunately for FELIX, IC\nstudents voted for someone who had seen a typesetter\nbefore and who knew the\ndifference between a paste\nup board and a scalpel. It\ndoes amuse me, however to\nthink of Mr B anton fixing a folding machine, changing camera chemicals, or even\nworking the FELIX editor's obligatory 70 hour week.\nNever in a month of\nSundays dear, never in a month of Sundays! John Sharp has apparently\nbeen letting things slip at\nQT. On hearing about\nAdam Jeffries (QT\nChairman) being attacked\nby Stoic's Sarah Alsop with\na bottle of vegetable oil his\ngirlfriend was heard to\nremark that the slippery\nstuff was getting\neverywhere. With a knowing look he said\nsimply ' Mmm, yes it does dear, doesn't it,' We can o ly assume that the oil in\nquestion was virgin olive oil\nor else something was up.\nA snippet from student\nservices now. Mr Christian,\nwarden of Hamlet Gardens, has pissed off one of his\nmanagers to such an extent\nthat the poor man has\nresorted to becoming sub warden of Holbein House. Of course it may just be\nthat he wanted a change...\nThe 'sporty\nmathematician' mentioned\nin last weeks column has\nfailed to recognise himself\nwhile a Holbein resident\nhas red faced ly been\ndenying that he was the\nculprit ever since FELIX was published. The real\n'droopy' was very\nsympathetic about the\n' unknown' mathematician,\nexclaiming that he had\nfound someone else who had his problem. Such innocence in a man is\nrarely found.\nWell, I 'll have to say ta ta\nnow as I have a pressing\nengagement (yes, it's the\nironing again)...sorry about\nall the pun-ish ment you've\nreceived, I guess I was just\nin the mood this week (for\npuns, dear, for puns).\nAnyway, lots of love kids:\nand remember..no one likes\na smart ass.\nFriday 31 January FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "RAG\nIn Britain students\ntraditionally help raise\nmoney for charity. As well\nas being great fun it also\nhelps to create a better\nimage for IC. Last year IC\nRag raised just under\n\u00a310,000 and it looks like\nwe're well on the way to\nbeating this figure by the\nend of the academic year.\nMost students content\nthemselves with supporting\none or two events in Rag\nWeek and forget about it\nfor the rest of the year but\nas Rag Chairman, Jon\nIngham, writes, there is still\nlots more you can do for\nRag.\nRag Committee\nSince those lazy, hazy days\nof Rag Week last term, the\nRag Committee have been\nrecouping their energies for\nthe coming months. Behind the scenes, one of our many enthusiastic first\nyears has been to the\nNational Rag Conference in\nAberystwyth over\nChristmas and has come back with loads of ideas for\nus to play with. So, to get\nback into the swing of\nthings this year, the\nfollowing events have\nalready be planned:\nParachuting\nMen cap are offering you\nthe opportunity to\nexperience the thrill of a life time. A2,000 foot\nparachute jump under\nexpert supervision and it\nwon't cost you a penny! At\nthe same time you'll be\nraising money which will\ngo towards the largest\ngroup of disabled people in\nthe country-those who are\nmentally handicapped. A chance that you really jump at! ( Excuse the pun).\nWhat's the catch, I can hear\nyou asking? Firstly you must obtain an application\nform from a member of the\nRag Committee. Then sign\na declaration of fitness and obtain a doctor's certificate.\n(Sorry all of you sufferers\nfrom epi lips y, diabetics\n(mellitus), py s chi at ric disorder, drug abuse and\nschizophrenia but you're\nnot acceptable). Then you\ngive \u00a360 bond money plus\nthe application form to the\nRag Chairman, Jon Ingham\n(The Rag Pigeonhole is in\nthe IC Union Office in Beit\nQuadrangle). When your\nbooking has been\nconfirmed then you've got\nto raise a minimum of \u00a3125\nin pledged sponsorship to\nmake a first parachute\njump. You can choose the\ndate of your jump so that it\ndoesn't clash with other\nevents in your calender and once you've completed the\nbasic training and made the\njump you can claim your \u00a360 bond back on handing\nyour sponsor money in.\nDon't miss the chance of a lifetime. Either come to\ntoday's Rag Commit te Meeting or see Jon Ingham\nbefore 7 February.\nRCS Rag Trip\nR CSU are planning aRag Mag Selling tour in March( probably Friday 7 to\nMonday10 March) which involves twenty people and\nabout 5,000 Rag Mags travelling around Britian in\ntwo vans. You need a great\nselling technique and a strong stomach. Likely\nuniversities to be subjected\nto the onslaught are\nManchester, Leicester,\nLoughborough, Nottingham, Bradford, Salford , Aston, Birmingham, Keele and\nWarwick. If you think you can sell 250 mags in four\ndays then all it will cost is\nyour food and missing 2\ndays in college. Don't be\nput off by the idea that this\nis just a 'hacks' tour. It\nwon't be if you come along\nwith a few friends. It's open to every student in College but priority will go to R CSU Members. Valentine's Day Message\nor Hit Squad with a difference. Are you madly\nin love with the brunette in\nthe third row of the lecture\ntheatre? Are you too shy to\nmake your feelings known? Well we've got just the\nthing for you! For only \u00a33\nyou can have a special\nmessage and a box of Milk\nTray delivered to your\nloved one by a dashing,\ndebonair, young enon y mou s parachuting ski i er!( All because the lady\nloves Milk Tray) All profits\ngo to Rag. Please book this 'never to\nbe repeated' offer with\nKathy in the IC Union office by Tuesday11 February.\nRag Fete\nThis year the annual Rag Fete will be held on\nSaturday 26 April and will\nbe opened by Anne Diamond so make a note of\nit in your diary. It's not too\nearly to start thinking about\nthis one and we will be\nespecially happy to hear\nfrom clubs, societies and hall committees who wish\nto take part.\nRag Meeting\nIf you're interested in any\nof the above events or in\nhelping us to organise much more-or you're aS oc Rep, then there's a meeting\nof the Rag Committee today at 12.30pm in the\nS CR, Union Building.

However, it was 15\nminutes before a twenty\nyard cross come shot from\nMartin Bradley dipped under the cross bar, taking\nthe lead for IC.\nIC's second goal came from a free kick taken by\nGuy Poppy and expertly\nnodded past the St Thomas keeper by Mike House by on the near post.\nDespite several attempts\nby the St Thomas defence\nto keep the ball out of their\nnet (including a hand ball,\nconveniently ignored by the\nref) Mike House by scored his second and IC's third\nwith a flick past the keeper\nfrom one yard after a shot\nby Dave Lynne bounced across the face of the goal.\nIt was this combination that saw IC go 4-0 up just\nbefore half time with Mike House by putting Dave 'go\nfor goal' Lynne through\nand Dave pushing the ball\npast the advancing keeper.\nThe second half saw\nmore attempts at the St\nThomas goal, including a25 yard curler from Alex Lung hi which hit the post,\nrebounded back into play,\nleaving IC flat footed as St\nThomas ran past the bored\nIC defence and slotting the\nball in the back of the net.\nIC were quick to retaliate,\nand were awarded a penalty after Guy Poppy was brought down after a thirty yard run. Mike House by showed the first\nteam how to take penalties\nand scored convincingly\nfrom the spot to put IC 5-1\nup.\nIC's sixth goal came from\na penetrating pass from\nGuy Poppy to Mike House by( again in the six\nyard area) who couldn't miss from that close!\nIC's seventh and Mike House by' s5 th was\nexcellently taken by Mike as he chipped the keeper\nfrom 18 yards after a searching pass from Chris Eng berg.

As chairman of the newly\nformed Undergraduate Studies Committee, he is\nclosely involved in the\nCollege's current review of\nteaching methods.\n'The meeting should be a valuable opportunity for\nstudent representatives\nfrom all departments to find\nout what this important\nnew committee is up to,\nand to put forward ther\nown views', said the event's organiser, IC Union Academic Affairs Officer J Martin Taylor. The meeting\nwill also consist of a training exercise for\nStudent Reps and a general\ndiscussion on academic affairs and the Union's work in this field. Mr Taylor hopes the event will\nbecome an annual one if\nthis first attempt is a success. The meeting will be held\nin Ci vEng201 from 1.45pm until about 5 pm, with\nProfessor Blow being\npresent for the first hour.\nAll Academic Reps are\nparticularly encouraged to\nattend, although the\nmeeting will be open to any\ninterested student.\nFacts And\nFigures\nThe Undergraduate Studies\nCommittee is sending questionnaires to various\ngroups in College as part\nof its review of teaching\nmethods. IC Union has\nundertaken to survey\nstudents on its behalf to\nfind out how much time\nthey spend doing academic A/ or k, both timetabled and private study, and on social activities. The questionnaires are being\nsent out to Academic Reps for a pilot survey, and a general survey of all\nstudents will be carried out\nwithin the next few weeks. It is hoped the information\ngained will enable student\nworkloads to be moderated\nsince some departments\nare felt to overwork their\nstudents.\nSlow\nResponse\nLiverpool University Guild( the students' union) are\nstill awaiting a definite\nreaction from NUS to their\nrefusal to pay their\naffiliation fees. They have\ncollected over 2000\nsignatures supporting their\naction. M rAndy Wilkinson, the Deputy President of the\nGuild, spoke to the NUS Regional Convenor on\nWednesday last week. He later told FELIX that he was\nexpecting to receive a final\ninvoice and felt there was a possibility that Liverpool's delegates might be refused\nadmission to the next NUS conference in April. Mr Wilkinson thought the\ndecision to withhold half\ntheir fees may become an\nissue in the forthcoming\nelection for union\nsabbaticals.\nSWAPO\nTalks\nShap u a Kau kung u a,UK representative of the Southwest African People's Organisation ( SWAP O) addressed an IC Anti Apartheid Society meeting\nin the UD Hon Tuesday. It was in 1966 that the\nUnited Nations terminated\nthe South African mandate\nto govern Namibia, said Mr\nKau kung u a, and this\ndecision was confirmed by\nthe International Court of\nJustice in the Hague, which declared the continued presence of South African forces in Namibia illegal.\nHe stressed the importance\nof the Western support in\nthe conti nu ed occupation of his country, pointing out\nthat Britain obtains about\nhalf of its uranium from\nRio-Tinto Zinc's Rossirtg\nmine in Namibia. Gossip\nObserver diarist, Peter\nHillmore, gave a talk for\nWell Soc on Monday. Mr Hillmore spoke for half an\nhour on the role of the\ngossip columnist, on journalism and on the\nnewspaper industry.\nRegarding the morality of\nthe gossip column, he said\nthat only people in the\npublic eye should be\nmentioned and ended with\nthe phrase 'never shoot a pigmy with a howitzer'.\nEight Of The Best\nIC Rector Eric Ash launched boat club's new eight on\nFriday. The boat, surprisingly also called Eric Ash, has\nalready won competitive races since its controversial\npurchase at the start of the academic year. In a short\nspeech the Rector told a small audience that he had done\nsome sculling during his time as a student at Imperial.\nBoat club qo ach Bill Mason also announced plans to run\nrowing courses for sixth former s in the summer vacation.\nIt is hoped that this will attract good rowers to the college\nand help with the club's attempts to attract sponsorship.\nIn On The Act\nStudents living in private\naccommodation under a licence may be able to get\ntheir rents reduced by up\nto 5 0 % following a ruling\nby a Sheffield judge last\nweek. Pete Mard on, a law\nstudent at Sheffield\nUniversity, argued that he\nand his two flat mates enjoy\nthe protection of the Rent\nAct even though a licence\nthey signed with their\nlandlord seemed to strip\nthem of protection against\nexcessive rents, unfair\neviction and bad housing conditions. The students\napplied to their local rent\nofficer, hoping that a 'fair\nrent' would be set below\nthe \u00a317 per week they had\nagreed to pay. Taking his\ncue from a House of Lords judgement last year, Judge Cottan ruled in favour of\nthe student's claim. Students living in London who currently hold licences\nare encouraged to apply for\na fair rent to be set at the\nRent Office of their local\ncouncil.

    "content": "Moonie Blues\nMembers of the Unification\nChurch, the Moonies, have been\ncanvassing in the College area\nthis week. Calling themselves\nthe 'Collegiate Association for\nthe Research of Principles'\n(CARP), followers of the cult\nwere seen trying to recruit\nstudents outside the Mechanical\nEngineerig Building on Tuesday\nand Wednesday. They have now\nbeen banned from College\npremises by security.\nThe Unification Church is an\numbrella organisation funded\nby the Korean millionaire Sun Myung Moon, and operates\nunder at least 60 different\nnames throughout the world.\nThe movement has been widely\ncriticised for using\nbrainwashing indoctrination\ntechniques and exploiting\nyoung people. The headquarters of the Unification\nChurch are at Lancaster Gate,\non the other side of Hyde Park.\nCARP also has premises near\nGower Street.\nNo other London College contacted by FELIX reported\nseeing the Moon ies in recent\nyears, although IC security\nconfirmed that they were\nsighted regularly in South\nKensington at this time of year.\nICU President Carl Burgess described the Moon ies as 'bad\nnews' when he spoke to FELIX on Wednesday. He said that\nMoonies outside Mech Eng\nthey were a highly dangerous\norganisation who professed to\noffer students a release from\nthe drudgery of work, but in\nfact only brainwashed them. He\nwarned that people who joined\nthe cult were separated from\ntheir family, deprived of their\nbelongings, and frequently\nended up 'psychologically\ndamaged'. Mr Burgess said that\nthe leader of the Moon ies was a con man who was feeding on\nthe insecurities of various\npeople to fill his own pockets.\nHe added that they were very\nadept at brainwashing\ntechniques.\nMr Burgess had spoken with\npeople who had attended\nmeetings, and said that they\nhad received a severe\npsycho lg ical battering. 'It is in\nour best interest to remove the\nmoon ies from our property' he\nconcluded. FELIX Move Latest\nCollege administration have still\nnot reached a final decision\nover the plans to move the\nFELIX Office to the north side\nof Beit Quad. FELIX Editor\nHugh Southey, Business Manager J Martin Taylor and\nUnion President Carl Burgess had further discussions with\nCollege Secretary John Smith\nlast Friday. Mr Smith accepted\nthe arguments against the\nmove, as presented in the paper\nsubmitted by Mr Southey two\nweeks ago. He was still\nconcerned, however, that to use\nthe kitchen area behind the\nLounge to accommodate the\nspace needs of the Biology department, instead of moving\nhe FELIX office, would put the\nUnion in a vulnerable position.\nMr Burgess later confirmed\nthat Mr Smith had agreed that\nto move the FELIX office might\nbe an 'expensive usage of\nmoney which would be better\nspent elsewhere'. Mr Smith is\nstill investigating the cost of the\nmove.\nProfessor Anderson, Head of\nthe Biology Department, spoke to FELIX about the move on\nWednesday. He said that he had\napplied to College for more\nspace for Biology, but added\nthat how this space should be\nallocated was not directly his\nconcern. He said that his\ndepartment was receiving\nexternal funding for research\ninto molecular paras it ology and\nspecifically into developing new\ndiagnostic techniques and\nvaccines to help combat\ninfectious diseases in the third\nworld. He explained that these\ndiseases are still the major\ncause of mortality in developing\ncountries.\nTo accommodate the new\nresearch program it will be\nnecessary to expand the\nexisting laboratory facilities.\nProfessor Anderson stressed\nthe importance of this research\nwork, and added that it would\nbe best to keep facilities\ntogether to avoid any need of\nduplication. He did not feel that\nfor Biology to takeover the\nLounge kitchen area instead of\nthe FELIX office and Beit Hall\nTV Lounge would be very\nsatisfactory. Professor\nAnderson added that in his own\nview the proposed move of the\nFELIX Office seemed like a good deal for the Union.\n3 3\nTJ A A_AU Oft A A1CS Free! Friday 31 January No 729\n\n"

    "content": "Faith\nDear Sir,\nI send my thanks to Mark\nAlder ton for co-ordinating\nan excellent Features page\nin last weeks FELIX. I should state now, however\nthat I a man atheist. Like\nAndrew Pettman I was raised by my parents and school to be a christian,\nbut when, at thirteen I rejected my teachings I did not set about to re find God. My faith was shaken by\nbecoming aware of the\nother religions to be found\nthroughout the world and history. Why follow\nChristianity when I have not\neven tried or thought about\nany of the rest? Obviously this is because I was born\nand raised in a christian\ncountry and a baby is not\ncapable of freedom of\nchoice. So now that I can choose shouldn'tI search\nfor and follow the 'best'\nreligion. The christian\nwould say that it does not\nmatter, that all religions\nbelieve in the same God and that it is only in the\npractise of worship and\nspecific beliefs that they\ndiffer. This is true. There is\na common thread running\nthrough nearly all religions,\nwhich is:-Don't kill, don't rape,\ndon't steal etc. These are\nideals useful to maintaining\na stable society and come more from man than from\nGod as I think Mark\nAlderton recognises. So far\ntherefore, I should be\nhappy as a pantheist.\nHowever, Christianity and in fact any religion does far\nmore than uphold the rules\nof society. For any\nindividual everyday life can be difficult to handle. There\nare times when everything\ngoes wrong and you have\nno friends at hand to help.\nIt is then that God, as a figurehead, provides the\nisland of stability to keep\nyou going, he is always\nthere to look after you and love you. In a way this is an\nextension of the way\nreligion is used to explain\nthe inexplicable. The world\nis a complex and possibly\nhostile place, but it all\nbecomes quite acceptable\nif a benign god is there to\nmake sure you don't come to harm.\nA regular place of\nworship is also\nParanoia?\nDear FELIX Editor,\nIt's not that I'm paranoid\nbut there are men in\norange jackets carrying\nbrushes following me about.\nIt appears that during last\nterm the Physics Blackett\nlaboratory was quietly\ninvaded by RB K and C road sweepers. There was a time when students would arrive each morning to\ncheck the letter rack, drink\ncoffee and generally\nsocial is e. Nowadays they\nnervously tiptoe about,\nleered at by hoard es of\nroad sweepers smoking coughing their guts up and pondering on the finer\npoints of 's hovell in' dirt'.\nNobody ever objected to\nan occasional outsider\ncoming in for a quick cup of coffee and the use of the\ntoilets. However, I believe\nthe situation is getting out\nof hand now that the\nPhysics building has\nbecome a regular meeting\nplace. The sight of up to\nnine or ten road sweepers is\nnot something I or many\nother students wish to be\ngreeted by each morning.I urge College Security to\nrectify this situation\nimmediately.\nO Smith\nPhysics 3\nPropaganda?\nDear Esteemed Comrade Southey,\nI write in disgust at the\nstate of our decadent\nimperialist radio station.\nI strongly believe that the\nideologically sound body\nthat was IC Radio is being\ntaken over by scheming, capitalist colonialists, lackeys\nof insidious Ronald MacDonald worshipping r otters from America. The station plays nothing but\ndecadent, boring and morally corrupting, so called 'middle-of-the-road'\nfilth such as R.E.O Speedwagon. And as for\nthe presenters, they are\neither cheeseburger eating\ncousins of emperor Reagan or wimp e ring stooges of\nthe bourg oise like Mr So called 'Automatic Barrier'\nwhose show is a carefully\ncalculated blow to our free\nand democratic cultural\ndevelopment. If matters do not improve rapidly (ie\nmore of that wonderfully\nprogressive and\nrevolutionary group\n'Hawkwind') I shall be\nforced to listen to the more\nculturally sound but\ndistinctly less funky radio\nTirane.\nYours sincerely\nEugene Zhog\n(Albanian Mountain cycling\nchampion 1962)\ncharacteristic. This not only\nreaffirms an individual\nbelief, but provides a focus and meeting place for the\ncommunity. Seeing the\nother people around you in\nchurch gives a sense of\nbelonging, particular y if\nyou recognise that the\nchurch extends to millions\nof other people. A friend of\nmine enjoys going to mass\nnot only for spiritual\nfulfilment, but also because she gets to meet her\nfriends and have a chat\nafterwards.\nThese then, are some of\nthe benefits of being a christian. Above all they\nmake you happy. So what\nis the problem? Why amI an atheist? Christianity is\nnot designed to be\nquestioned. Originally only\nthe priests could read the\nholy teachings and they\ntold the people what was\nright and wrong, heretics\nwere silenced. Even now there is the mysticism of\nexperiencing God, an event\nwhich we are told cannot\nbe described but which you will know when you've had\nit. So today, in trying to\nanalyse God, he appears\nconsistent in himself.\nHowever in analysing the\nevolution of religion from\nthe worship of inanimate\nobjects, God appears a logical creation of civilised\nman. This is a stark\ncontrast to man being the\ncreation of God. With this\nknowledge I cannot believe\nwithout worshipping a false\nGod. In recognising the\npurpose of God as a pillar\nto support me in times of\ndifficulty, the pillar\ncrumbles. A placebo will\nnot work if the patient\nknows he is eating chalk. I can believe in God as the\nvoice of my conscience( itself the result of my upbringing and hence\nsociety), but then Iam only\nbelieving in my own strength of character, not\nan external, all pervasive,\nall powerful being.\nPersonally I think life\nwould be happier with God, but I cannot choose to\nbelieve. In the light of this I had to answer an important\nquestion before writing this\nletter. Is it morally right to\ntry and spread atheism?\nThis is not my intention.\nHowever if Ido not voice\nmy ideas, they could not be questioned and criticised,\nand so would stagnate.\nWhat Ido think is\nimportant is that you do not just ignore God, whether he exists or not.\nYours (faithfully?)\nAndrew M Dunn\nPhysics 2\na93 It's Free!\nTRAVEL\n\u201e* Ft \u2022*\" t SIP\nMz0 \u2022ml\nTheWortdbeaters\nUL U Travel, Imperial College,\nSherfield Building,\nPrince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7.

The attitude\nvalent in this society Is\nlot dissimilar to that found\nin Ernest Hemingway' s adventure stories for big\nboys, which generally take\nthe form:\n'Captain Berty 'Big No b' Bulldog pushed forward\nalone, machine gun\nblazing, he had no fear, his\ncourage lay in his\nenormous cock...It was\ninevitable that he would die: his penis was so large\nthat the enemy could not\nhave missed. The captain\ndied knowing that he had\ntaken out at least fifty of\nthe swine with him.'\nLiterature is not the only\nart-form that has been\naffected by the scourge: Music is contaminated too.\nI refer principally to Heavy\nMetal: it is an insidious\nform of music that relies\nvery heavily on sexist\nattitudes. One could\ndismiss the lyrics as\nInspite of this blatant\nsexism, IC radio continues\nto provide air time to this\npornography. Thus sub con cio us ly we are being\nindoctrinated and\nconditioned into believing\nthat it is perfectly\nacceptable to molest cute,\nfurry, little creatures.\nThe gross turpitude of\nmusic is not exclusively\ncontinued to modern day\nartists, in fact, most of the\nheavy classics are genital ly orientated. For example, it\nis rumoured that the\norchestra and choir, both\nof who seem to be innocent\norganizations, were\n' coming in their pants'\nduring their renditions of\nthe ' Carmina Burana'. It is\nnot good enough to say\nthat because it is written in\nLatin then the lyrics are\nmeaningless'. To sing\nabout the rape of virgins in\na different manner makes it\nmore grotesque by turning\nit into some sort of fetish.\nThis example emphasizes my concern that sexism is\nprevalent throughout the\nwhole college since it has\npenetrated even the\nseemingly innocent\nsocieties.\n'Literature is not the only art-form that has been affected by this scourge'\nMichelangelo's original cartoon for the roof of the Pristine Chapel, entitled 'You\nwanna sign Adam, How's this?'\nsymbolism and revels in the\ntrue meaning of the 'joys of\nmotoring'. Moreover, all\nsports societies have sad oma soci stic overtones and\nmotives\u2014especially the\nmore 'physical' ones.\nAnother club which has\ncaught my attention for\ntheir flagrant sexism is the\nScience Fiction Society.\nOne can understand that\nlittle boys might experience\nsome enjoyment from\nzapping bug-eyed green\nmonsters but one must\nquestion the mentality of\nthose who extend this\nharmfully nauseating if they\ncontain themselves to their\npathetic fantasy imagery,\nhowever, they do not and\nare grossly objectionable.\nGenerally, they revolve\naround public ising the\nsinger's 'huge erect one'\nand how he lays fifty\nwomen a night. I quote the\nexample:\nI was a hobbit/ she was\nan elf/she turned me on/ so\nI abused myself/1 was a hobbit/ And my name's Bilbo/ She spread her\nlegs/ And I rammed in a dildo.\nI could continue listing\nother clubs and their\nactivities, however, lack of\nspace prevents me from\ndoing this. So, to conclude; these clubs will not change voluntarily, sexism will\ncontinue to flourish at IC\nwhen action is not taken.\nBoycott all social and sporting societies and picket the Haldane Library\nuntil all offensive material\nis removed from its shelves;\nthen perhaps we might\nhave a meaningful and equitable social life for all\nat Imperial.\n\n"

    "content": "Karate Karate-Do is increasing\nin popularity throughout\nthe world. However with\nthis increase in popularity,\ncertain misconceptions about the principles of\nKarate have arisen.\nMost people if asked\nabout karate, will think of\nthe breaking of bricks and\ntiles, or of simple\ncompetitions where two\npeople appear to attack\neach other savagely. Karate\nis none of these things in\nessence, and to practice it\nsolely as a fighting\ntechnique loses the\nfundamental discipline and\nself-control that must play\nthe predominant role. The training therefore\nencompasses etiquette and\nthe spirit of humility, as\nwell as dev lop ment of the\nfitness of both mind and\nbody. The essence of\nkarate techniques is 'Kime',\nmeaning an explosive\nattack to an appropriate\ntarget, using maximum power, and originally\ncomes from the Japanese expression meaning to 'Kill\nwith one blow'. Due to\nobvious danger though\ncompetition rules make\ncontact with an opponent\nillegal. How can this be\nreconciled? The target\npoint is established in front\nof the opponents vital\npoints, and hence the\ndevelopment of self control\nof forms a fundamental\nbasis for Karate.\nThe history of Karate is a development from an art\nknown as 'Tote', meaning\n'the hand', which was a fighting technique\ndeveloped in Japan a rou on d1429. The Japanese Empire covered\nmany of the islands in the\nSouth China Sea at this\ntime Karate originated on\nthe island of Okinawa. As no weapons were allowed\nby Japanese overlords, the\nOkinawan s used 'open\nhand' techniques as a method of self defence.\nThere are many styles of\nKarate. The Shoto kan style\nemphasizes 'power and\nspeed'. Within the style\nthere are three major\naspects: 'Kata', 'Kumite' and\n'basics'.\nKatu are 'formal\nexercises' which consist of\nlogical arrangements of\nblocking and striking in\npre-set sequences. The 'Kata' promote physical\ndevelopment of bone and\nmuscle. Additional benefits\nare fast reflexes and the\nability to move quickly.\n'Kumite' is the art of\ncontrolled free-fighting.\n'Basics' are the\nfundamental techniques,\npunches, kicks and blocks\nwhich form the basics of\nthe sport.\nProgression and standard\nin the sport is measured by\nthe colour of the belt worn.\nThere are nine belts or\n'ky n' prior to Black Belt (1st Dan). The changing of\nbelts is called 'grading',\nwhich is a formal\nexamination of an\nindividuals ability. Ability is\nmeasured by performance\nin a predetermined Katu,\nsequence of basic\ntechniques and fighting,\nthe exercises vary with the\n'Kyu' standard aimed for.\nIC Karate club has been\nrunning successfully for\nseveral years; training on\nMonday, Wednesday and\nSaturday in Southside\nGym. Cae ser Andrew is a permanent instructor for\nthe Bu do kwai Judo/Ka rate club on the Fulham Road. This was the first club\noutside Japan to teach\nJudo. It was founded in\n1918 and has produced a selection of Olympic, European and World\nChampions; for example,\nNeil Adams and Brian\nJacks. Caesar has recently\nbeen appointed instructor\nto Eton College; where a new Martial Arts centre has\nbeen built.\nThe club regularly\nparticipates in competition.\nIn the National Student\nChampionships, held at\nKeele University, the club\ntook 2nd and 3rd place in\nthe Men sTeam Katu\ncompetition.\nGrading s are held at the\nend of each term, examined by a top instructor. He is\nthe chief Instructor for\nShotokan in Great Britain\nand Europe, Mr KEn oed a(8 Dan); one of the highest\nranking Ka retch a in the\nworld and one time\nchampion of Japan. The; club is fortunate\nenough to receive top class\ninstruction and sponsorship for its Karate act ivies. Presently arrangements are\nbeing made for Geoff\nThompson, four times\nWorld Champion, to visit\nthe club.\nLasf Wednesday Mr Hazard visited IC to give instruction to\nIC Karate club. The training session saw Mr Hazard\nrunning the class through some basic techniques, placing\na strong emphasis on good control, technique and\nespecially 'Kime'.\nWhen performing basic techniques the body should\nremain relaxed and tense only at the end of a movement,\nwhen contact is made. This tension is know as 'kim e' or\nfocus.\nTowards the end, the techniques were put together into\ncombinations, with Dave Hazard demonstrating how fluid\nand easy the movements can be. To finish off, a truly\nspectacular display was produced by Dave and Caesar\nAndrews (3rd Dan), IC's regular instructor. Starting with\nstatic kicks and punches, both quick, free-sparing\n('Kumite'). This explosive aggression of their kicks and\npunches made you wonder if they were still friends!\nDave Hazard commented that: 'IC Karate club is one of\nthe better clubs I 've seen, and has an excellent display of\ndiscipline and attitude.'\nDave, 33, first achieved his Black Belt at the age of 20.\nSince then he has won many titles and medals as well as\ngaining overall third place in the World Championships in\nJapan (1977). He is now concentrating on teaching and\nsharing his experiences with his pupils not only in the UK,\nbut all over the World; in places such as Germany,\nHolland and Turkey.\nUnion Bar\nFebruary Guest Ale\nAdnams 74p/ pint\nHappy Hour\nTuesday 6-8pm Wethereds 50p/ pint\nThursday 6-8pm Fosters 50p/ pint\nSilwood Valentine's Party\nFeaturing The Millar Family'\nStarts at 8pm Tickets from Gareth Fish\nand Life Sci Reps\nFELIX Friday 31 January 7\n\n"
