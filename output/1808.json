Older\nstudents will recall that the Fair\nwas either held online or at\na reduced capacity over\nthe last two years, and\nthis meant that even\nsecond, third year, and\npostgraduate students\nwere seen making rounds\nat the fair, collecting\ntheir customary\nm e r c h a n d i s e .\nThis unique opportunity\nhas indeed brought many\npositives, as students have\ngotten a chance to rebuild their\nsocieties and replenish the ranks.\nHaving so many people roaming freely\nthroughout campus also meant that\nFreshers\u2019 Flu has had a chance to re-emerge. Certainly, attending Welcome\nevents through livestreams during the\nOctober closures did not hold a risk of\ninfecting anyone (being in lockdown\nfrom Covid had this added benefit!).\nHowever, this now means that neither\nsecond or third years are immune\nto the dreaded Freshers\u2019 Flu, and\nare likely to also suffer ill effects of\na sore throat, headache, and cough.\nA return to in-person lectures also\nmeans that students are more likely\nto attend lectures.

Indeed, today\u2019s\nyouth, though digitally connected,\nstill crave human, in-person\ninteraction, and this is evident more\nthan ever in the sizeable number of\n\u2018Give it a Go\u2019 events. When sign ups\nwere first made available, societies\nreported delays in confirmation and\nupdating of the Union\u2019s \u2018What\u2019s On\u2019\ncalendar. This was entirely due to\nthe (unanticipated) sheer volume\nof applications. Students across\ndifferent cohorts and departments\nare bright tier by their common\ninterests, and this innocuously opens\nthem up to increased exposure.\nWith temperatures continuing to fall\nas we approach winter, societies are\nincreasingly moving what outdoor\nactivities they had to indoor venues\nin favour of keeping warm. The\nCollege, in its October guidance, is\ncurrently recommending wearing\nface masks in crowded places and\nbeing fully vaccinated. All these\nfactors so far are equally relevant to\nCovid, which has also been making\na resurgence in recent weeks.

    "content": "The animal world will never stop\namazing us. Bats are the only mammals that can fly. Surprisingly, they are\nalso amongst the most populous mammals in the world, though the exact\nnumber of bats is unknown as these\nsneaky animals are small and nocturnal.\nDid you know that bats can live up to 40\nyears despite being such small creatures?\nOr that they are capable of resisting dangerous viruses inside their bodies, where\nother animals would die? Let\u2019s explore\nthese facts in more detail.\nHow can bats live for so\nlong?\nSmall mammals are usually highly active and have short lifespans. A perfect\nexample would be the common mouse,\nwhose heart beats ten times faster than\nh u - mansand\no n l y\nlive 1-2\ny e a r s .\nBats are\neven more\nactive than\nmice because they can\nfly, which is an energetically demanding activity - but unlike mice,\nbats often live between 30-40 years.\nEmma Teeling and her group have\nstudied the chromosomes of 493 specimens of four different species of bats to\nunravel this mystery. In particular, they\nfocused on telomeres, which are long repeating sections of DNA located at the\nends of chromosomes that protect the\nintegrity of chromosomes. Telomeres\nshorten with each cell division, up to a\npoint atwhichtheyareunabletoprotect\nchromosome integrity. This means the\ncells can no longer divide, and increases the risk of suffering irreversible DNA\ndamage that can lead subsequently to\ncancer. The cell enters into a non-divid-ing phase called senescence. The gradual\naccumulation of senescent cells leads ultimately to body deterioration and age-ing.Batsdonothavethecapabilitytore-generate telomeres, but they have more\ntelomere repair and maintenance genes\nthan other mammals. This allows bats to\npreservethelengthoftheirtelomeresfor\na longer time, prolonging their lifespans.\nMitochondria are the powerhouse\nof the cell, proving the latter with energy to conduct its metabolic activities.\nTherefore, healthy mitochondria are\nessential for the proper functioning of\nthe cells, which affects ultimately the\ngeneral health of the organism. Contrary to other organelles, mitochondria\nhave their own DNA that regulates their\nfunctioning. Over time, mitochondrial\nDNA accumulates mutations that disrupt the correct activity of mitochon-dria. The size of bat mitochondria\nDNA is smaller compared\nto other mammals,\nwhich means that\nbat mitochondria\nDNA suffer fewer deleterious\nmutations on\naverage. Therefore, the mitochondria of\nbats are\nable to\nfunction\nprop er-ly for a\nl o n g e r\ntime.\nHow do bats\nsurvive infectious\ndiseases\nwhich kill\nother an-imals?\nBats are\ncarriers of\nmany dangerous viruses such as\nSARS-CoV-2\nor the Ebola\nvirus that could\npotentially kill\nthem, but in reality\noften don\u2019t. The key resides i n\nthe immune system of bats, or more pre-cisely, in inflammation. Inflammation\nis the reaction of the immune system to\nthe entrance of pathogens into the body.\nInflammation is beneficial in a short and\ncontrolled manner, but prolonged inflammation is harmful and is associated\nwith diseases like diabetes. Futhermore,\nexcessive inflammation can be even\nworse than the direct effects of an actual\nvirus because it can irreversibly damage\ntissues and organs. Indeed, one\nof the major causes of\ndeath in SARSCoV-2 was\nn o t\nnecessarily\nthe virus itself,\nbut exces- sive inflamma-tion. Bats experience less intense\ninflammatory responses than\nhumans, so are not subjected to the\nsame level of damage. Subsequently, instead of eliminating viruses, bats have a\nhigher tolerance to them, finding a way\nto co-exist together. The immune system\nof humans is designed to eliminate viruses as fast as possible, which increases the risk of inflammation causing\nsevere damage.\nTo understand the mechanisms\nbehind inflammation in bats,\nresearchers at Duke-NUS Medical School studied the DNA of\ndifferent bats across the globe.\nThey found that the protein\nNLRP3 is less active in bats\nthan in other mammals\nlike humans. NLRP3 is a\nmajor inflammatory sensor,\ntriggering inflammation against\npathogen attacks. Bats from all over\nthe world have this less active form of\nNLRP, indicating that it emerged a long\ntime ago.\nThe parasitic dependence of the viruses on bats is incredibly fragile. Habitat destruction caused by humans\nhighly stresses the bats, weakening their\nimmune systems which keep viruses\ncontrolled. This causes the viruses to\nreplicate uncontrollably, allowing them\nto mutate faster, which unfortunately\ncould allow them to make the jump\nfrom\nbats to hu-mans.\nThe molecular\nbiology of bats is unique in the animal\nkingdom. Bats are of similar sizes to\nmice but live 20 times longer because\nof telomere maintenance genes. Viruses\nthat would be lethal for other mammals\ncause almost no harm to bats. These little flying animals are simply fascinating\ncase studies which demonstrate the diversity and beauty of nature.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nScience\nThe bat paradox\nStaff Writer Wang Guo explores the unique biology of bats, which are small but remarkably long-lived\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 14TH OCTOBER 2022\n15\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\npublic, a sense of hope in despair was clear to see in the\nincreased output of German sensual art and music em-bodiedbythemusichallsandcabarets;anorgyofscant-ilycladwomen,raucousmusic,cocktailsandsexuallib-eration all blurred in thick clouds of cigarette smoke. It\nwas the true artistic culture that would eventually succumb to the boot in the face by the brute, brute hearts\nof German nationalism. Schulhoff\u2019s works were targeted by Nazi censorship and Schulhoff himself would die\nincaptivityafterattemptingtofleetotheSovietUnion.\nThe \u2018Sonata Erotica\u2019 is perhaps the most raw musical work to come out of this movement. Written\nin 1919, it exemplifies the sexual lifestyle of most\npeople living within the Cabaret sector of society.\nIt is a piece written for Soprano solo in three move-ments, each characterised by a different portion of\nthe sexual act: foreplay, intercourse and post-coitus.\nLike most pieces of music for voice, there are clearly written notations, dynamics, lyrics, and phrasing.\nThe\u2026 \u2018prelude\u2019 if you will, consists of the woman\ninviting the man to have sex with her. The man, pre-sumably, pleasures her as the music directs her to give\nstaggered moans of varying dynamics with long pauses followed by sudden forte outbursts of moans again.\nThe second act, which is a segue from the first, is where\nthe man makes his entrance. The moaning now is directed to be more staggered but rhythmical. Glissandos\nfrom high to low pitches give her performance more\nflavour and occasional interjections of \u201cnot so rough\u2019\u201d\nor \u201cdo it faster\u201d cut across the texture as the dynamics\nbecome increasingly louder and louder. The segment\nis followed by her crying out \u201cfaster, faster, faster\u201d in\never-increasing pitch, tempo and dynamic, before she\nclimaxes with \u201cJETZT\u201d (\u201cNOW\u201d) at ffff dynamic and\nprestissimo. The notation on the score is wild and covers over three octaves of pitch while overall descending\nin pitch and dynamic before ending on a quiet note.\nThe last movement is very visceral. The woman\nin post-coital quivering tries to make conversation\nwith her lover while occasionally having aftershocks.\nShe asks questions such as \u201chow was that for you?\u201d\nfollowed by \u201cdo you really love me?\u201d The music directs a long pause while the woman makes mild agitated rustling at her lover\u2019s lack of interest. The man\nremains unresponsive. At the end she asks if \u201cthey\ncan be reasonable\u201d but to no avail. Instead, the score\ndirects the woman to piss in the toilet and leave.\nThe audio experience of this piece is very visceral (headphones would be a helpful recommendation\nwhen listening to it). Even though the entire piece is\nscored with every musical direction possible, the details post-coitus, for example, are so strikingly real even\nthough everything has been scored and performed; for\nthe soprano\u2019s character the performance is for her lover\u2019s pleasure, but for the soprano herself and the composer it is for the audience\u2019s pleasure. The audience,\ntherefore, is privy to the act itself and is entranced by\nthe vivid imagery conjured by this impressive score.\nWe are shown how even the act of average sex\nand how even roles like foreplay and the variations\nof sexual acts that ensue can be summed up in a disappointingly short ten-minute piece. This gives the\naudience a conundrum: the piece portrays a real and\ngenuine night of pleasure but is juxtaposed with the\nfact that, since it is a musical score, the noises coming out of the soprano are all composed; all fake.\nMeg Ryan showing us how a man couldn\u2019t always\nknow that a woman is faking an orgasm and proving\nher point was a piece of artistic craft. It requires one\nto convince your partner that you\u2019re having the time\nof your life when in actual fact it\u2019s mediocre at best.\nBut to be convincing, one must think about what\nwords to say, what sounds to make, how loud one\nscreams and at what pitch as shown in \u2018Sonata Erotica\u2019. Of course, during the act such thoughts are instinctive but when you see it phrased like this and\nwritten out, it is obvious that faking an orgasm is no\ndifferent to composing a well-crafted piece of music.\nAlbum Reviews\nAlvvays Rock On\nWritten by Neel Le Penru Music Writer\nThe band embraces a bolder, more energetic sound on their third album, Blue Rev, which might be their best yet.\nIt\u2019s been 5 long years since Canadian dream-poppers\nAlvvays\u2019 impressive sophomore LP, Antisocialites, in\nwhich the band very much proved that they were more\nthan indie/bedroom-pop one-hit-wonders, thanks to\nrefinements to the writing and production since their\nstrong 2014 debut. The question, after a troubled wait\n(that, along with the global pandemic, saw the band\nlose demos to a stolen recorder and gear to a flood),\nwas: could they do it again? The answer: most definite-ly.\nThe band\u2019s latest effort, Blue Rev \u2014 released last Friday\n\u2014isalreadybeingtalkedaboutasoneofthebestalbums\nof the year. Over the course of 14 fairly snappy tracks,\nthe album takes the best of Alvvays \u2014 the melding of\ngloriously jangly guitars and dreamy synths with singer\nMolly Rankin\u2019s ruminations on life, interspersed with\nenergetic riffs and punchy bass lines in a retro-nostalgic\nsound that never strays into stereotypical pastiche \u2014\nand turns things up a notch, quite literally in this case:\nthe band\u2019s energy is palpable throughout, starting from\nthe relatively (by Alvvays standards) frenetic guitar solo\non opener \u2018Pharmacist\u2019.\nPerhaps this dynamism stems from the fact that Blue\nRev was committed to tape in live takes over the\ncourse of just two days (with the band\u2019s signature\nfine-tuning afterwards). Where much of Antisocialites\ncould be characterised as the meshing of\ndelicate melodies and punchier moments\ndelivered with careful restraint, Blue Rev,\nthough not shy of some tranquil passages,\nfizzes boldly, often awash with droning\nand distorted guitars, almost like a more\ntender My Bloody Valentine record.\nThe same parallel came through on stage\ntoo: the band took to London\u2019s Islington\nAssembly Hall on Blue Rev\u2019s release day\nwith great zeal, playing a 20-song set\nspanning their 3 albums. Arguably a testament to Blue\nRev\u2019s writing as well as fans\u2019 dedication to the band,\nsongs both new and old proved to be crowd-pleasers;\nthe band\u2019s renewed vigour got the crowd moving \u2014\nwhich was disappointingly absent when I last saw\nAlvvays perform \u2014 and chanting along with them. I,\nfor one, had a stellar time \u2014 and I\u2019d highly recommend\nanyone with a taste for indie/dreampop/rock to check\nout/revisit Alvvays too.\nAlvvays continue rocking on (photo: Adrian LaMoury)\nThe trio at it again, back after a series of tragedies\n\n"

A folk-rock artist from Wales, Bryde\n(Sarah Howells) writes the kind of music I aspire to\nplay: rich, raw vocals accompanied by striking lead guitar riffs, heavy bass backing, and energetic drums. Her\nlyrics are moving and emotional, especially on the newest album Still, which speaks of love in all its unique,\nmessy forms. The title song \u2018Still (shadow)\u2019 and \u2018Hill\nI\u2019m Dying On (unrequited)\u2019 are two prime examples.\nThe concert on Wednesday 5th October, at the\nFolklore venue in Hoxton, was a very different experience from her performance at Latitude \u2013 intimate and\nwholesome. Folklore is a lovely little eccentric space\ndecorated in\na woodland\ntheme, with\nlots of greenery and colourful mood\nl i g h t i n g ,\nand I would\nd e f i n i t e l y\nrecommend\nlooking out\nfor gigs happening there (despite the slightly unsavoury location in North-East London).\nHowells\u2019 voice has a soulful clarity to it that, paired\nwith her stirring lyrics, is enough to bring tears to\nyour eyes. The band\u2019s renditions of \u2018Peace\u2019, \u2018Algorithms\n(cyber)\u2019, and \u2018Honey\u2019 were bold and ethereal, and\nmade me wish I had a breakup to mourn while listen-ing. Howells is also a master on lead guitar; her vo-cals-and-guitar-only songs \u2013 like \u2018Epilogue\u2019 \u2013 acted as a\nbreath of calm among the wildness of the other songs.\nI may be biased here, but a few rough starts with untuned guitars and wrong keys did nothing to detract\nfromthepurerevelryofBryde\u2019sset.Ifanything,Howells\u2019\nresponses to these slipups made the gig all the more en-joyable.Thecamaraderiebetweenthethreebandmem-bers pulled you in, like sharing inside jokes with them.\nHowells filled the interludes between songs with anec-dotesandquips,talkingabouthowsheplayedinaband\nat school, and about their drummer\u2019s recent engage-ment. The nature of Folklore also meant that we were\nable to meet the band and briefly chat to Sarah Howells after the gig had ended \u2013 no VIP tickets necessary!\nOne thing about live music that I realised I missed\nduring the pandemic was how different it sounds when\nwatching the band play in real life. Songs also tend to\nbe altered to fit into a set, which gives them a quality\ndistinctive from the recorded versions. One of my favourite songs that they performed on the night has to\nbe \u2018Flies\u2019, which manages to be soft, heavy, tranquil, and\nchaotic all at once, and is infinitely more enjoyable live\nthancomingoutofmyshowerspeaker.Eventhoughthe\nset was relatively long, clocking in at around 70 min-utes, it was still disappointing when it came to an end.\nOn the\nwhole, it was\nmesmerising to\nlisten to, and\nan excellent\nlive act to see\nas my first one\nin four years.\nSmaller gigs are\nincredible for\nproperly experiencing music, especially when you\u2019re familiar with\nthe songs, and I\u2019m looking forward to taking full advantage of the multitudes of artists that choose to tour\nin London and throughout the UK (now that we\u2019re\nfree of masks, hand sanitiser, and lateral flow tests).\nBryde was completely surreal in the best way possible,\nand if the other concerts I choose to go to are even\nhalf as good as this one, it will be money well spent.\nTakeaDipintheDiscographywithourSpotifyplaylist!\nBryde performs at Hoxton\u2019s Folklore\nBryde (photo: Zanna Buckland)\nBryde (photo: Zanna Buckland)\nFelix Recommends\nI\u2019ll Sing what She\u2019s Singing\nWritten by Gilbert Jackson Music Writer\nHow faking it makes you a great composer as well as a great actor\n\u201cOh...Oh God...Ooo Oh God...Oh...Oh...Oh...\nOh God...Oh yeah right there Oh! Oh...Yes\nYES\u2026\u201d \u2013 Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally\nAutumn is a wonderful time of year: trees wearing their finery of red and gold, crisp frosty\nmornings, woollen knitted jumpers, hot coffee during the day and hot chocolate during the night; a\nwonderful time of year indeed. It needs no explaining then, that after a hard day of work, coming home\nto a cup of tea, a warm bed, and the perfect movie\nis the best way to end the day. A fabulous autumnal watch would be the all-time classic Billy Crystal\n/ Meg Ryan rom-com that is When Harry met Sally.\nThe story pans out the collision between two per-sonalities. Meg Ryan\u2019s character wants to live the perfect life and often strives to find the perfect man to\nlive it with. Billy Crystal\u2019s character wishes the same\nthing, but despite the friendship that his character\nand Ms. Ryan\u2019s character have, he remains adamant\nthat a man and woman can\u2019t be friends since they\u2019ll always want sex at some point. Lo and behold, they do\nhave sex at some point, so he was right in some ways.\nOne of the most obvious scenes where we realise\nthey may not be friends all the time is the scene where,\nafter Billy Crystal\u2019s character boasts he knows when a\nwoman is \u2018faking it\u2019, Ms. Ryan gives the performance\nof the decade by exploding into an orgasmic fury of\nmoans and screams while beating the table. Of course,\nthis is proof of Ms. Ryan\u2019s supreme acting talent and\nshows that faking an orgasm is a dramatic art. However, art has a way of bleeding into different media\nand we can often find instances where drama, art,\nand music combine. Needless to say, faking orgasms\nis very much a musical art as well as dramatic one.\nThe proof for this statement can be found in a work\nof 20th century music titled \u2018Sonata Erotica\u2019 by Erwin\nSchulhoff. Schulhoff was an archetypal figure present\nin the Dadaist movement during the era of European\nReconstruction in the aftermath of the Great War; a\nman truly living la vie Boh\u00e8me. In the new Weimar Re\u2018When Harry Met Sally\u2019 starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal.\nCastle Rock Entertainment and Nelson Entertainment\n\n"

    "content": "Among the university student\ndemographic, it is undoubtedly\ntrendytobearepublican(seedefinitions).\nA YouGov poll in 2021 found that when\ngiven the choice between a monarch and\nan elected head of state, 31% of 18-24\nyearoldswentwiththemonarchy,whilst\n41% went with the elected option. I\nsuspect that if this poll was carried out\nwith university students aged 18-24, the\ndifference would be far more starkly in\nfavour of republicanism. In any case, in\nthis piece I hope to lay out my reasoning\nfor siding with the minority opinion\non the issue, and strongly encourage\nanyone who feels otherwise to write a\nresponse article for next week\u2019s Felix.\nProbably the most cited argument\nagainst the British monarchy is that\nthe institution reinforces class division,\nas members of the royal family acquire\nwealth and prestige through nothing\nbut birthright. This argument falls apart\nunder the most surface level scrutiny, as\nswathes of people are born into riches\nand elevated social status because their\nparents led prosperous careers, or are\nthemselves living off old, invested\nmoney. Furthermore, one should\nask what the effect of\nabolishing the\nmonarchy\nw o u l d\nb e ,\nrather\nt h a n\njust\nstating that it is unfair. It is vanishingly\nunlikely that replacing the monarchy\nwith an elected head of state would do\nanythingtohelpthosewhoarestruggling\nfinancially in the country. Sweden, one\nof the most aggressively egalitarian\ncountries in the world, is a monarchy.\nSouth Africa, meanwhile, is not.\nFar from increasing inequality,\nmonarchies can in fact decrease it, and\nthe UK monarchy is the prime example\nof this, owing to its global fame. The\nSovereign Grant, the total amount of\nmoney the Treasury gives to the royal\nestate each year, was valued at \u00a386.3\nmillion for 2020-21. It\u2019s worth noting\nthat after the relatively modest (I mean\nrelative to the whole grant, not to the\nlikes of you and me) living costs of the\nroyal family are accounted for, the\nvast majority of this grant is spent\nin ways that public money is\nspent more widely anyway. \u00a334.5\nmillionofthisgrantwastobespent\non servicing Buckingham Palace,\nproviding employment to builders,\nsurveyors etc, and amounts essentially\nto \u00a334.5 million in infrastructure\nspending. Dwarfing the grant, however,\nisthemoneygeneratedbytheroyal\ninstitution as a global attraction.\nThe consultancy Brand Finance\nestimated in 2017 that the\nmonarchy generates a gross\nuplift of \u00a31.766 billion to\nthe UK each year, or over\n20 times the value of the\nSovereign Grant. This\nuplift comes mostly in the\nform of increased tourism,\nwhich improves the revenue of all kinds\nof industries, from stalls selling royal\nbranded merch to intrigue causing\nmillions to tune in to shows such at The\nCrown. Any economic strain caused\nby the monarchy is far outweighed\nby the financial boon it brings in.\nCrucially, and often overlooked in\nsuch discussions, is the differing systems\nof government between the UK and\nsuccessfulrepublicssuchastheUSAand\nFrance. Recent travesty wreaked by the\nUS Supreme Court aside, republics with\napresidentialelectedheadofstateremain\nsignificantly protected from tyranny\nthrough the inalienable rights bestowed\non every citizen by their constitutions.\nDonald Trump could argue that the\nelectionwasstolenallhewantedtowards\nthe end of his tenure as President, but\nhe never had an inkling of power over\neach citizen\u2019s right to bodily autonomy\nor free speech. The Supreme Court\ndoes, though that\u2019s for another article.\nContrasting this with the UK system\nis actually quite stark. The Prime\nMinister of the UK has nowhere near\nthe technical power of a President, and\nhas historically been coined a \u201cfirst\namong equals\u201d, as all governmental\nministers have supposed equal authority\novertheirbriefs(thoughthisisnotreally\nthe case any longer). Furthermore, the\nUK electoral system elects a party rather\nthan an individual. Donald Trump was\nthe Republican candidate in the US\n2016 election, but was individually\nelected as President. Boris Johnson was\nthe leader of the Conservative Party, and\nthe Conservative party won the 2019\ngeneral election, not Boris Johnson.\nMost crucially, the UK does not have\na written constitution, a flaw in the\nsystem that Johnson and his government\nexploited no end during their time in\noffice. Priti Patel should have resigned,\nor been sacked by the Prime Minister, in\n2020 after having been found guilty of\nbullying her subordinates in the Home\nOffice, as this behaviour breached the\nMinisterial Code. Johnson simply\nignored this, and Patel remained Home\nSecretary for two more years. Similarly,\nthePolice,Crime,SentencingandCourts\nBill proposes massive curtailments of\nthe right to freedom of assembly. This\nright is enshrined in the US constitution\nand cannot be legislated against. No\nsuch protection exists in the UK.\nA redeeming feature of the UK\nsystem is, wouldn\u2019t you have guessed,\nthe monarchy. The PM is beholden to\nthe King, at least on paper. Bills have to\nacquire royal ascent to become UK law,\nand the King has the power to reject\nany that reach him. In practice, this will\nnever happen, as a monarch overruling\nthe will of an elected government would\nvery quickly find themselves no longer\non the throne, but the official sub-ordinance of the PM to the monarchy\nremains important in a soft, behavioural\nway. Every morning the PM should\nwake up in the knowledge that they\nwill carry out their duty to King and\nCountry, rather than to their own will.\nOf course, these principles can be\nerodedinpractice,asJohnsonhasshown\nin an exemplary fashion. The final form\nof this protection is, however, incredibly\nimportant, and cannot be curtailed. The\nBritish Army is sworn in allegiance to\nKingandCountry.Britishtroopsdidnot\nland on D-Day in the name of Winston\nChurchill. Were we to elect a more\ntyrannical government in the future,\ntheywouldneverbeabletocommandeer\nthe army to enforce military rule. This\nis perhaps the most crucial role of the\nmonarchasheadofstate-thatthosewith\ntrue power are beholden to those with\nalmost none. An elected head of state is\nsomewhatindebtedtothosewhoelected\nthem, the King owes nothing to anyone.\nFRIDAY, 14TH OCTOBER 2022\n5\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWhy I am a royalist\nSam Lovatt Managing Editor\nComment\nDefinitions\nRoyalist: A supporter of a particular monarch\nMonarchist: A supporter of the general idea of monarchy, rather than a particular\nmonarch\nRepublican: In this instance, a supporter of the replacement of a monarch with\nan elected/appointed head of state.

    "content": "Period poverty is a lack of access to\nadequate menstrual health manage-ment. This includes menstrual health\nproducts, health education, and hygiene\nand waste management facilities. It arises largely due to economic reasons, but\nsocial, cultural, and political factors also\nplay an important role. The World Bank\nestimates that 500 million women and\ngirls are affected by period poverty glob-ally. One such group is the women living\nin Dufatanye Organisation\u2019s Villages of\nHope in Nyanza, Rwanda, who are unable to go to school or work for several\ndays at a time due to period poverty.\nTo help combat this, researchers from\nthe Department of Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London,\nand sustainable development start-up,\nMinazi Consulting, are attempting to\nproduceenvironmentallysustainable,af-fordable, high-quality sanitary pads for\nthe women of the Villages of Hope, using the fibres of the banana tree. Central\nto the project is the challenge of making\nthe manufacturing process as simple as\npossible using locally available materials.\nThegroundworkontheproject,sponsored by Imperial\u2019s Professional Project\nFund, began in August\n2021 with lead researcher Naa Ayorkor Harding\nconducting market research to understand the\nwomen, their lifestyles,\nneeds and wants. Research\nwas also conducted into\nthe feasibility of extracting and using the fibres\nembedded in the trunk of\nthe banana tree to make\na sanitary pad. After this\ninitial four-week sprint in\nRwanda, development of\ndifferent layers of the proposed sanitary pad began,\nwith technical and project\nsupport offered by the Minazi Consulting team, and\nPhD Student and Minazi\nProjects Director, Aakeen\nParikh.\nOver the past year, the\nteam developed the absorbent core of the sanitary\npad, arguably its most important layer.\nBanana fibre was selected as a key material due to its relatively high absorbency,\nand its abundance in Rwanda; 90% of\nall households in Rwanda grow banana\ntrees.\nThe next big challenges are developing the top-most and bottom-most\nlayers, known as the acquisition and impermeable layers respectively. In 2022,\nover a seven-week period from July to\nAugust, researchers trained the local site\nteam, teaching them how to produce the\nabsorbent core, how to build a full-pad\nprototype, and how to conduct scientific experiments in parallel with work\ndone in the labs at Imperial. Additionally, there was further research and development of other layers of the pad, such\nas the impermeable layer, which is also\nexpected to be produced locally. Over\nthe coming academic year, the team will\ncontinue development of the key layers,\nmaking the production process cheaper\nand even simpler than it is now. All of\nthis will be part of Naa Ayorkor\u2019s final\nyear project in Mechanical Engineering.\nFRIDAY 14TH OCTOBER 2022\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nDesigning sustainable sanitary pads\nNaa Ayorkor Harding Science Writer\nMechanical Engineering student, Naa Ayorkor Harding, spent the summer in Rwanda, sponsored by Imperial\u2019s\nProfessional Project Fund, developing sustainable, affordable sanitary pads using banana fibres.

    "content": "On 18th October, the Deputy\nPresident (Welfare), Working\nClass Officer, and Union President will\nbe making recommendations to increase\nthe Imperial Bursary awarded to Home\nstudents. The recommendations will be\nmade to the Access and Participation\nCompliance Group, which monitors\nthe Imperial Bursary, and ensures\ncompliance with Imperial\u2019s Access and\nParticipation Plan. According to the\nplan, the College is aiming to \u201cequalise\nthe number of students in each quintile\n[of POLAR 1-5]\u201d. POLAR classifies\nareas across the UK into five quintiles\n- based on the proportion of young\npeople who enter higher education aged\n18 or 19 years old.\nBased on 2020-21 and 2021-22\nImperial Bursary Surveys, 6% more\nstudents currently on bursary reported\nworking part-time in the last academic\nyear. Of these students, the number\nreporting that they are working to cover\nessential needs like transportation,\nutilities and food has increased by 10%.\nAdditionally, bursary-receiving students\nhave spent 10.2% more in average\nmonthly expenditure since last year.\nAccording to this analysis, the\nUnion believes that, whilst helpful, the\nImperial Bursary has not been sufficient\nin cushioning the impact of cost-of-living increases on eligible students and\nis recommending a 10.2% increase to\neach individual bursary.\nThis survey did not consider the\nimpact of inflationary rises on currently\nineligible students. In 2012, the\nmaximum household income threshold\nfor Home undergraduate students to be\neligible was \u00a360,000. Today\u2019s equivalent\nwould be \u00a376,921.89, representing a\n28.2% decrease in the income threshold.\nThe Union is also recommending that\nthe threshold now be increased to\n\u00a377,000 in order to offset the impact of\ninflation over the last decade.\nStudents with a household income\nbetween\u00a325,000and\u00a330,000were20%\nmore likely to take up part-time work\nduring term-time; they are also 9% more\nlikely to do so to finance their essential\nneeds. This represents students in Band\nB, and each year, they receive:\n\u2022 \u00a3706 less in government loans\nthan those with a household\nincome below \u00a325,000 (A1-A2),\nand\n\u2022 \u00a31000 less from the Imperial\nBursary than those with a\nhousehold income below \u00a316,000\n(A1)\nCurrently, only those in Band A1\nreceive the maximum Imperial Bursary\nof \u00a35000, and those in Bands A2-B\nreceive \u00a34000. The Union recommends\nthat students in Band A1-B receive the\nmaximum bursary each academic year.\nOver the last 33 years, the average\nyearly inflation rate in the UK has been\ncalculated as 2.62%, and the Union\nrecommendsthattheImperialBursaryis\nincreased at a yearly rate of 2.62%. This\nwould ensure that students continue to\nreceive a bursary amount that benefits\nthem equally throughout their degree.\nCurrently, by their final year, a BSc\nstudent will lose a total of \u00a3396.43 to\ninflation, integrated Master\u2019s would\nlose \u00a3799.82, and a medic would lose\n\u00a32035.01.\nNathalie Podder\nDeputy President (Welfare)\nUnion recommends 10.2% increase\nin Home bursary\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n4 Felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\nCredit: Imperial College Union\nWrite for Felix!\nFelix provides an outlet for all students and staff to review, read about and report on whatever\nthey want.

    "content": "Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nAs we enter a new age of economic\nand technological advancement,\nwe are presented with a challenge unlike\nanything before: the impact of growth\non the world we live in. The climate\ncrisis is here, but whilst some call for a\ndifferent way of developing, others are\nbeginning to question the economic\ngrowth model. Is it sustainable to grow\nin the same way as before, or should\nwe be looking at new ways to progress?\nIn recent years, the term \u201cgreen\ngrowth\u201d has been increasing in\npopularity. In simple terms, as the\nOECD defines it, green growth refers\nto the continuation of economic growth\nwhilst ensuring natural assets to keep\nproviding resources. Therefore, some\nthink this strategy would be the best\nway to keep the economy growing\nwithout damaging the environment.\nHowever, Mike Joy, a researcher from\nthe Institute for Governance and Policy\nStudies, describes green growth as an\noxymoron. Joy highlights the fact that\n\u201cgrowth\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d cannot work with\none another. Joy continues to say that\nfor an economy to grow, extraction and\nusage of natural resources is necessary.\nTheprocessofdoingsowillthenincrease\nthe usage of energy. His question is: how\nis this environmentally sustainable?\nMany focus on the growth of the\nclean energy industry, and how this\nfactors into the green growth strategy.\nHowever, Mike Joy points out the vast\ndifference in the energy density levels\nbetween renewable energy and fossil\nfuels. Due to renewable energy\u2019s low\nenergy density level, we would need\nlarger areas to provide the same energy\nas fossil fuels. Joy continues to mention\nthat moving away from fossil fuels is\nessential. However, exclusively leaning\ninto the dependency of a clean energy\nswap is not ideal, especially in the short\nterm. Joy suggests a shift in focus to\nreduce consumption and waste instead.\nThis leads us to degrowth. The World\nEconomic Forum describes degrowth as\nawaytoscalebackontheusageofnatural\nresources. Supporters of the degrowth\ns t r a t e g y\nchallenge the\nGDP metric\nas a dominant\nway to measure\na growing\ne c o n o m y ,\nhighlighting\nhow the\nmetric lacks\nenvironmental\nand social well-being. Victoria\nMa s t e r s o n ,\nSenior Writer\nfor the World\nE c o n o m i c\nF o r u m ,\nproposes that\nd e g r o w t h\nwill focus\non shrinking\ne c o n o m i e s\n( h o w e v e r\nnot reducing\nGDP) by using\nless natural\nresources and putting environmental\nand social well-being ahead of profit.\nMasterson points out that if the\nworld continues to grow as it is, major\nclimate events will occur. However,\nopponents of degrowth argue that\neconomic growth has led to significant\nbeneficial findings to society, such as\nmedical treatments. Arguments of\ndegrowth are often from a very Westerncentric viewpoint, ignoring the fact that\ncolonisation and the spread of Western\npower have caused other countries to\nbe underdeveloped comparatively. The\nargument that all countries should now\nfocus on slowing GDP growth is seen as\na privileged standpoint, as developing\ncountries have not reached the same\ngrowth level as developed countries.\nGreen growth and degrowth both\nhave positives and negatives. Green\ngrowth is something which should be\nprioritised in many cases around the\nworld as it allows for the areas which\nneed further development to grow in\na more environmentally sustainable\nway without sacrificing future progress.\nYet there are fundamental issues with\ngrowth targets modelled by the past.\nIf we are to truly develop in a way that\ncreates a more sustainable future, we\nneed to consider the areas and sectors\nin which degrowth would be more\nappropriate. However, arguably every\ncountry and sector is different and\nshould therefore be considered on a\ncase-by-case study. Fundamentally,\nwe need to look at all the options to\ndecarbonise and develop sustainably,\nbutthisneedstotakehistoricalreference\nand climate justice into account\njust as much as climate solutions.\nNadia Nik Arif Environment Writer\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n8\nEdited by: Marie Mori\nEnvironment\nGreen growth or de-growth?\nCredit: Envato Elements\n\n"

    "content": "This may have been the best night of my life. No,\nseriously. Ever since her album Giving the World\nAway came out in April, I\u2019d been so excited to see Hatchie play at Village Underground. I spent the whole\njourney there practically wriggling with excitement.\nWhen we arrived, the spacious, industrial Village\nUnderground was scattered with only a handful of\npeople,includingamiddle-agedmanwithahandmade\nposter for his kid who was playing in the show. The\natmosphere was calm; generic pop music played in the\nbackground and the room was glazed with soothing,\nyellow light. It was beginning to fill up and the low\nhum of people\u2019s chatter started to build. Out of the\nshadows a tall figure emerged, dressed in a white shirt\nand a plain black dress. There she was. You could see\npeople\u2019s heads turn as she gracefully made her way\nthrough the room, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.\nAfter a few cans of some organic, zero-waste cider\n(which, by the way, I really don\u2019t recommend), the\nlights dimmed and there on stage was Winter, our\nfirst support act. She had her hair in space buns and\nwore black fishnet, it was giving goth girl. But when\nshe started to sing, to my surprise, out came a sweet,\nmelodious sound. With reverb for days, textures and\nlayers that were rich yet light, and a stunning bell-like voice, she set the bar high for the evening. My\nfavourite song was \u2018Violet Blue\u2019, featuring a deliciously\nchromatic bassline and perfectly-used whammy bar,\nshe created a sense of unease within a greater theme of\ncomfort. I loved her duality.\nThe second act was a complete contrast to Winter\u2019s\nsound. London-native Tatyana brought an electric\nenergy to the room with her harp and MacBook. As\nI write this,\nI\u2019m reading the\nnotes I made\nduring the gig:\n\u201cgiving charli\nxcx lockdown\nalbum, v\ntechno, so\nfabric\u201d (for all\nyou freshers,\nFabric is a\ntechno club\nin London).\nThat essentially sums it up. Her expert combination\nof glitchy vocals, complex harp solos, and interesting\nscales thrilled the audience and got us all dancing.\nIt was particularly interesting to hear electro-pop\nproduction go hand-in-hand with an R&B-style vocal\nquality, overall a very unique artist.\nAndthen,themainevent:Hatchieherself.Clutching\nawhitebass,shemadeherwayonstagewiththeband.I\nwas in shock at how loud the bass was, I could feel it in\nmy chest and throat. As the first song played, a strange\nfeeling rushed over me; I\u2019m not usually one to become\noverwhelmed\nb u t\nHatchie did\nsomething to\nmethatnight.\nI can hardly\ndescribe the\nemotions I\nwent through\nbut I\u2019ll do my\nbest here.\nF i r s t l y ,\nprops to the drummer - Hatchie leaves no bar unfilled\nsotheyweredefinitelysweatingbytheendofthenight.\nNotonlywasthedrummingsupertightandconsistent,\nbut it was also powerful without taking any attention\naway from the rest of the band. The guitarists and\nkeyboardist also played their part in recreating the\nmagic of the studio-recorded tracks, not a single note\nsounded different from the original versions.\nHatchie also did incredibly well to translate the raw\nemotion conveyed in the songs of her album into her\nlive performance. I genuinely feel as though this album\nwas *made* to be performed live. This was especially\ntrue during her performance of \u2018Quicksand\u2019. Ditching\nher bass for this number, you could really see her feel\nthe music and it really came through in the way she\nsang and performed it, it almost looked like she was\npossessed by it. I was genuinely mesmerised, so much\nso I started crying but that\u2019s just what her music will do\nto you. There was something so cathartic about getting\nto scream \u201cI used to think that this was something I\nwould die for\u201d with her, almost like my life was a movie\nfor 3 short minutes. It really shows that Hatchie writes\nbig, stadium dream-pop songs.\nShewasalsoincrediblycharmingwhiletalkingtothe\naudience, always thanking us and making it known just\nhow excited she was to be in London. A particularly\nheart-warming moment came after the crowd had sung\nalmost as loudly as her and she remarked: \u201cWow, I\u2019ve\nonly been playing shows like this in Brisbane\u201d.\nI felt a real wave of sadness after the show ended and\nIonlygetthatfeelingaftershowsI\u2019llrememberforever.\nIf you haven\u2019t already, listen to her album, and if you\nget the chance, catch her live.

She\u2019s alone, but not for long;\nanother girl comes in the shot and invites\nher to a sleepover. Maren\u2019s not sure, her dad\nwon\u2019t approve.

Her fleeing dad,\nfrightened of her desires for\nhuman flesh, left her with an\nenvelope of money, her birth\ncertificate and a recording.\nThat\u2019s where her journey\nof self-discovery begins.\nAs we watch the movie, we\ntravel and experience the world of\ncannibalism through her eyes.

He\u2019s\ngot the perfect creepiness to his\ncharacter, his crazy eyes and soft-spoken voice bring chills to the\naudience. However, the movie is\nnot dark. Its self-aware humor\nhelps overcome those eerie and nasty scenes.\nNot long after Maren gets into this world\nshe meets Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who plays\nLee, with whom the main romance in the\nmovie begins. They bond over their common\ndesires and struggles. Both wish to be nice, to\ncare, they don\u2019t want to harm innocents.
