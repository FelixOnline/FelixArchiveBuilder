Out is a comedy inspired by\nTom Hanks' Philadelphia Oscar\nacceptance speech, in which he\naccidentally outed his gay high\nschool teacher. In the big screen\nversion of events, it is Matt Dillon\nas Cameron Drake whose message\nof gratitude calls into question the\nsexuality of his old teacher Howard Brackett, played by Kevin Kline.\nWhat's more, Howard is about to\nmarry Emily (Cusack), his fiancee of\nsome three years, that very week.\nIn &. Out actively tries to distance\nitself from Hollywood 'issue' films\nand, left in no doubt that the\nsituation is to be played solely for\nlaughs, we are transported to\nGreenleaf, Indiana to witness the\neffect on Howard and his imp en ding marriage. The residents of the\nsmall town in America's heartland\nare initially sceptical, but the seeds\nof doubt have been s own. Mr Brackett always dresses so neatly,\nand he does adore Barbara\nStreisand. And so do all gay men, don't they? Of course, Emily is in no\nFILM COMPETITION doubt that her husband to be is\nhiding nothing. Then again, it has\nbeen an unusually long\nengagement, and yet their physical\nrelationship hasn't progressed far\nFILM COMPETITION beyond holding hands in front of\nthe TV. It's not only his friends and family who are studying his every\nmove, as America's lowbrow media descend on Greenleaf in\nsearch of a story. Among them is\nPeter M alloy( Selleck) a homosexual journalist who attempts to befriend Howard for\nthe sake of an interview.\nWe are used to seeing Kevin Kline\nin somewhat unhinged roles, so it\nis a relief that he doesn't overplay\nhis character'scamp leanings. It is\ndifficult to fault his performance as\na man desperately trying to 'blok e' up his prissy image. The film is\nserved well by its supporting cast,\nparticularly the female characters.\nJoan Cusack is very good as the\ndevoted Emily, whose self esteem\nis dented further by recent developments. However, the film is so\ndesperate to remain within the\nbounds of political correctness that\nmost of the reactions to the outed\nHoward are fairly predict i ble and safe. In &. Out is well executed to a point, but any charm it may have is\novershadowed by the truly\nappalling finale.

The inevitable havoc which follows provides plenty of laughs but\nnot as many as Bean's efforts to rectify the problems by going on a Bondstyle mission.

    "content": "10 COLUMNS 13 February 1998\nThere's nothing the press\nlike to do more than\nwrite about themselves.\nOpportunity to do so was recently given, when the press was\nbringing attention to the tactics\nRupert Murdoch, owner of News\nInternational, was using to maintain his control in the newspaper\nindustry.\nMurdoch had been engaging in\nvarious price cuts in the Times,\nsub sidi sing them from his Sky\nnetwork profits and running the\nTimes at a loss, his opponents\nsay. The Times countered that,\nsaying in its editorial that the\nTimes/Sunday Times ran at a very\ngood profit (although it didn't the\nTimes itself did - could the\nSunday Times be sub sidi sing the\nTimes?) and that what it was\ndoing was morally acceptable.\nMurdoch has many enemies - one\ndoes not get to become a worldwide press baron without making\nsome - and he is known as a bully, in the economic sense.\nWhat brought this issue to attention was the Competition Bill\npresently going through the\nHouse, to keep us in line with EU\nLaw. These are the occasions that\ndemonstrate the usefulness of\nthe Lords - since the Upper\nHouse are unpaid and cannot be\nfired, they only turn up if they feel\nlike it, and it seems that on this\noccasion, they felt like it. An\namendment to the bill in the\nLords, proposed by the Lib Dems,\nwas specifically aimed at\nMurdoch, or more specifically,\nthe Times, whose circulation has\nincreased to 800 000, partly at\nthe expense of the Telegraph and\nIndependent, and partly by\nincreasing the number of people\nreading broadsheets. The amendment passed by 121 votes to 93,\nand creates a headache for Tony\nMurdoch for all it's worth. The\nIndependent is present in dire\nfinancial straits, and the price-cutting at the Times will serve to\nfurther deepen its crisis. As they\nsaid, there is no point on having a loss-making title unless you\nintend to rid the market of a com-petit or. They are worried that this\nwill reduce press diversity, which\ncan only be a bad thing. Murdoch\nalready single-handedly ditched\nthe newspaper 'Today', for what-Hamish Common\nWestminster\nEye\nBlair. He will have no problem in\noverturning it in the Commons,\nbut it will look like he is riding\nroughshod over the will of the\nHouse (which he is). Labour and\nthe Tories both oppose the plan,\nmore out of fear than anything\nelse, but there are plenty of MPs\non both sides that would like to\nvote for the amendment.\nPolly Toynbee, a known opponent\nof Murdoch, has recently been\nwriting in the Guardian, calling on\nthe great and the good to oppose\never reason. This removed ace n tre-left paper, leaving only one,\nthe Independent left. Now the\nIndependent is under threat.\nMurdoch is known to have his\npapers espouse those views that\nare in his own best self-interest.\nHis opposition to the Euro is\nreflected in his papers' editorial\nline. The Sun has now got a reputation of winning parties election.\nIt is said you can't win one without them - a myth Murdoch is\nquite happy to keep going. The\nworry here is that there is a powerful media baron, who isn't even\nBritish, and may not have British\ninterests as his first priority. The\nLabour Government will remember well in the Eighties when\nLabour's planned policy of banning foreign ownership of the\nmedia was naturally ruthlessly\nopposed by Murdoch, with savage\neffect in the polls. He was sending a warning to anyone who dare\noppose him again.\nRecently, Ministers hinted at a deal that would get them off the\nhook in the Commons and prevent an embarrassing rebellion -since the single mothers vote,\nbackbencher s know that they\nhave the muscle to cause problems for the Government if they\nso desired. The Government may\nintroduce an amendment that\nwill deal 'more precisely' with the\nproblem of newspaper wars. This\nwill act as a compromise to diffuse the situation without losing\nface. But soon, Blair may have to\nmake a decision. Should he keep\nhis famed friendship with\nMurdoch going, or should he legislate in the interest of the British\npress and people? The two are\nsadly not the same.\n( MM As a special bonus this week, here\nare two recipes from the cook so\nwise, he almost makes preparing\ndinner parties enjoyable...\n1. Tarte a la Tomate\n\u00ae\" Vi lb ripe tomatoes\n\u00ae' 4 - 5 t bl dijon mustard\n\u00ae' Short crust pastry made\nwith 8 oz flour etc as\nexplained in a previous\nBurning Water\nPreheat your oven to 210\u00b0C, gas\nmark 7. Meanwhile roll out the\npastry to about 2 - 3 mm thick and\nplace it in you well greased tart tin.\nSpread the mustard out evenly\naround the pastry (like tomato on a pizza). Slice the tomatoes thinly\nand lay them out around the tart\nso that they overlap by about '/\u00bb a slice each. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and whatever herbs you have\naround .\nPut in the oven till the pastry is\nnice and brown, about 20 minutes.\n2. Chicken Cacciatore\n\u00ae\" 1 chicken, dead\nr JP1 onion\n\u00bb\u2022 5 cloves of garlic\n1 tin tomatoes\n\u00ae\" 1 glass of wine\nLoadsa olive oil\nHack the chicken to pieces. You should end up with 2 legs, 2 wing\nbits, 2 breasts and a carcass. Heat\nup about 1cm of oil in a frying pan\nuntil it's smokin1 hot. Fry all the\nchicken pieces until well brown.\nYou'll probably find it easier to do a couple of pieces at a time and I'm told it's better to fry the skin side\nfirst - it helps to retain the juices.\nChop and fry the onion and\ngat li c until they're also thoroughly\nbrown, adding some pepper and at bl of paprika near the end. Deglaze the frying pan with the\nglass of wine (we've been over this\nbefore) and combine everything in\na large pot. Heat up and leave to\nsimmer gently for at least an hour.\nA great carbohydrate accompaniment to this is pole nt a a golden yellow paste made from\nground up corn. It's available from\nmost market street stores and the\ninstructions on the packet are usually reasonable so follow them.\nAntoine\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 13 February 1998\nTeacher Training' News in Brief...\nfor Lecturers\nANDREW OFORI\nThere is a glimmer of hope on the\nhorizon for those who leave lectures more confused and worried\nthan when they entered. Plans to\nput new lecturers through a scheme of what is effectively\nteacher training are at a developmental stage within the college,\nand students are being encouraged\nto give input in order to enhance\nthe standards of education.\nThe requirement for a standardised system of training\nlecturers has been identified world-wide, with many countries currently designing national programmes.\nThe UK campaign has come about\nas a result of Sir Ronald Dearing's inquiry into higher education. A body known as the 'Accreditation\non Teaching In Higher Education'\nconsisting of 'key stakeholders'\nsuch as the NUS and the\nChancellor's Committee, has been\nformed to put a workable system in\nplace.\nThere already exists a course of\nworkshops and training sessions\nrun by Prof Sinclair Good lad for\nprobationary lecturers at IC, but at\npresent not all departments consider it mandatory. Preceding Government proposals, the college\nis now planning to construct a scheme that all new lecturers will\nbe required to take part in, and students are being asked to put their\nviews across.\nThe scheme will be a system of\naccreditation, including an assessment and a longer course than is\npresently the case. The College's two education development lect ur ers, Dr Caroline Baillie and Dr Rita\nVan de Vorst, will be instrumental\nin the implementation of the pro-gram me. Dr Baillie emphasised\nthat \"Lecturers have got to think\nabout why they're teaching the way\nthey're teaching and how effective\nthey will be in getting students to\nlearn\". She spoke of the 'world-wide realisation' that new lecturers\nneeded to be given instruction and\ntime to contemplate their\napproach to education. Dr Baillie\nfeels it vital that students take\nresponsibility for their own learning\nand channel their creativity into the\nbuilding of a system that benefits\nall concerned.\nThe college's Pro-Rector for\nEducational Quality, Prof Tim Clark,\ndescribed the importance of positively identifying objectives for the\ntraining in preparation for any\nGovernment proposals. He sees\nextensive consultation as one of\nthe essential elements of early talks\nand surmised \"The object of the\nexercise is to safeguard teachers,\nand most importantly safeguard\nstudents\"\nStudents are able to get\ninvolved through the Student LINK\ngroup (London Imperial NetworK)\nfor education development who will begin plans with the staff LINK\ngroup at a meeting on 9 March. It\nis hoped that the issue will strike a chord with students and they will\ntake full advantage of this opportunity: The student LINK group\nrequires a student representative\nfrom each department. Interested\nstudents should contact Kinishka\nSinha on k.si nha@ ic.ac.uk. For\nmore information and to comment further look at www.cvc p. ac.uk.\nC& GU 'BOTTOMING OUT'\ncontinued from front page\nconstitution, he commented, \"We need to completely re-st ruc ture the Union. This year has\nshown that the present system just\ndoesn't work.\" In addition, Mr Tylee-Birdsall highlighted the need\nfor a thorough assessment of\nC& GU's current financial position,\n\"We need to know what we're\ndoing and where we're going\". Finally, he pointed to com muni c ation between officers as one of\nGuilds' biggest failures this year,\n\"Exec try to stick to their own jobs\nand don't work together as a team... I don't even know who half\nthe Dep Reps are, and I didn't see\nthem at O&M C yesterday... we haven'ta clue what's going on half\nthe time\".\nHamish Common, Guildsheet\nEditor, sees Mr Tylee-Birdsall as\nthe ideal candidate; \"He's someone who' s not interested in politics\nand image... who doesn't sound-off or shout '1 want X,Y,Z'\", and\nSoren Dy mon d, Guilds Treasurer,\nwarmly endorsed him, adding \"He's a great poker partner\".\nSUSPECTS CAUGHT\nTwo men believed to be involved in\nseveral thefts on the Imperial\nCollege campus were apprehended\nby Imperial College security last\nThursday, and have subsequently\nbeen arrested by police officers.\nThe men have been caught before,\nbut there was insufficient evidence\nto detain them. Ken Weir, Deputy\nSecurity Manager, explained that on\nprevious occasions the men had\ngiven reasons for being on college\npremises. However when caught in\nBeit Quad they could not claim it\nwas a 'shortcut', and were detained\npending police investigation.\nMASSIVE MERGER\nThe news of a merger between\nGlaxo-Wellcome and SmithKline\nBeecham, two of the world's largest biotechnology companies,\nhas provoked fears that jobs will\nbe lost and funding for research at\ninstitutions such as Imperial\nCollege will suffer. Roger Lyons,\nthe Manufacturing, Science and\nFinance Union's general secretary,\nspeaking in The Times Higher\nEducation Supplement, commented \"This merger could have\ndevastating implications for university research and science graduate employment.\" However Dr\nChris Evans, formerly a microbiologist at Imperial, and now a millionaire biotechnology entrepreneur, commented in the same\narticle that he thought the merger\nwas \"extremely exciting\" and that\nthe new company would be even\nmore supportive of science in\nBritain.\nCANNABIS STUDY\nThe House of Lords has launched\na high powered investigation into\nthe legal status of the drug\ncannabis. Following the British\nMedical Association's November\nreport on the possible benefits of\nthe medical prescription of\ncan nabi noid s. Lord Chief Justice,\nLord Bingham, is calling for a \"detached, objective, in de pen dent\" consideration of the issue\nand the formation of a Lords\nSelect Committee. Chaired by\nLiberal Democrat Peer Lord Perry\nof Walton, a former professor of\npharmacology, the all party committee's terms of reference is said\nto cover \"the scientific case for\nand against relaxing the prohibition on the medical and recreational use of cannabis\". After taking evidence from 'expert wit-ness es', the Select Committee will\nhold public hearings after Easter,\nwith a report scheduled for completion in October.\nSPEAKER DEALERS\nBelgravia Police have released\ndetails of a second street trader\nthey are attempting to apprehend. The van, registration\nP415JP0, has been spotted near\nto both the South Kensington and\nSt Mary's campuses, and has\nbeen used to sell audio equipment to passers-by. The activities\nof these vendors, who have been\npresent in the area for several\nyears, is apparently becoming more furtive, leading to an\nImperial student being kidnapped\nlast week and forced to withdraw\nmoney from a cash point.\nAnyone seeing the van should\nreport it to Sherfield Security on\nx58900, noting the time, location,\ndescription of the vehicle's occupants and details of any conversation held. On no account should\nanyone enter into any purchase or\nget into the van.\nAIR DEADLY\nThe true cost of UK air pollution is\ncoming to light following a recent\nreport that values the damage at\n\u00a3 1 1 billion annually. The study,\npublished of ICS M's National\nHeart and Lung Institute,\nattempts to place a monetary\nvalue of the \"loss of quality of life\"\ncaused by the airborne toxins. The\nmodel employed, similar to that\nused by the Government when\nconducting fe as ability studies,\ninvolves quizzing the public on\nhow much they would be willing\nto pay to avoid the problems\nassociated with air pollution. Poor\nair quality is currently thought to\nbe responsible for health problems in millions of UK citizens,\nand the report claimed \"It makes\neconomic and health sense to\nclean up the air in our cities as an\nurgent priority.\"\n\n"

    "content": "20\nCLUB SCENE THE ELECTRIC CAFE MUSIC\nl/C< I '\u2022\n13 February 1997\n7s this close enough to\nthe camera for you?'\n- Dr. walker\nWelcome to another edition of the Electric\nCafe! First of all, many thanks to all of you\nwho entered the Reactivate Classics competition from last week. The response from the\nFelix readers was so good, that I have ordered\nextra CDs from the record label! As I am writing this column, I still don't know who won. I will have to wait until the response from the\nradio show (that went out on Sunday and\nTuesday this week) comes back.\nFor all of you who entered by email, I am\nthinking of starting up a mailing list so that\nyou will know what special features and competitions are coming up on the radio show\nand the Felix column. I will also tell you about\nclub nights in London, if I think something\nunusual or special is happening. It will be an\ninformal thing, decided by how often 1 can get\nto a computer to write it! If you would like to\nbe included on such a list, then please drop\nme a message (a. seth i@ ic.ac.uk) with your\nreturn address.\nThis week 1 want to tell you about a group\nof artists that have been making music out of\nCologne in Germany for a number of years.\nMany at Imperial will know Air Liquide as a French chemicals company. Only a few will\nrecognise the name as one of the most avant-garde German techno groups. But for those in\nthe know about the underground dance\nscene, Air Liquide have been consistently producing challenging, yet highly addictive music\nfor a number of years now.\nThree people make up Air Liquide; Dr\nWalker (Ingmar Koch), )a mm in' Unit (Cem\nOral) and singer Mary Applegate (who comes\nfrom a pop background, having written the\nlyrics to Jennifer Rush's hit single The Power\nOf Love'.). They have also built up a network\nwith other Cologne artists, including Khan\n(Cem's brother), Mike Inc and Jorg Burger. All\nthese artists are releasing material today,\nand all share a common vision and philosophy. So what is this vision? In an interview\nIngmar once said, \"I don't want to make\nmusic for people when they're washing dishes or cleaning their ap partments. It's boring,\nI hate this kind of thing. Music should touch\nyour heart, your fears, not make one sound\nfor half an hour.\"\nTo say Air Liquide's music is dark would\nbe an understatement. Whether they are\npumping out full-on techno, indulging in ele c tro, serving up rich, textured s oud s capes of\nambience or taking their new departure of\nbreakbeat s, you get the feeling they are right\non the edge of their abilities. If something has\nbeen done and put on the map of techno,\nthen you should understand that it is no\nlonger of any interest to them.\nI first listened to Air Liquide about three\nyears ago when I bought the album The\nIncreased Difficulty of Concentration. That\nexperience still lives with me today. In an age\nwhen music had to be \"uplifting\", the sound\nthey created was fresh. Air Liquide have a vast back-catalogue, scattered amongst a variety of labels. Check out Rising High, Sm:)e NYC, Blue, Djungle Fever, Blue Planet and\nHarvest. Albums such as Nephology (The New\nReligion), The Increased Difficulty of\nConcentration, Radiowaves and Air Liquide\nhave been pivotal moments in electronic\nhistory.\nOnce in the studio, Air Liquide follow no\nset rules or formulae. Their greatness comes\nfrom their unpredictability. You can't really\ntalk about pushing back boundaries when the\nboundaries don't exist in someone's head!\nIndeed, it does appear that the greatest\nexperimental artists of the electronic genre\nare the ones who don't think or create within\nset limits. Quite fitting for a form of music\nthat is inventing itself from totally new types\nof instruments and composition tools.\nAir Liquide was born of the school of hard\nknocks that was responsible for Ingmar's education. An electronics whizz from his\nteenage years, a load of new electronic\nsounds that he had invented were stolen by a synthesizer company at the age of sixteen.\nAfter that he produced a string of succesful\ncommercial hits for a Frankfurt house label.\nThree and a half million copies were sold, but\nthe company went bust before he could see a single penny of his cut.\nFrom that moment, Ingmar decided to\nmake only the music that he really liked. The\nresult is a new independent electronic music\nscene for Cologne, some of the most respected and admired music and artists of today, a multitude of labels and the highly succesful\nLiquid Sky parties. Yes! Liquid Sky was one of\nthe few club nights that I had a real longing to\nvisit. It was here that Air Liquide perfected\ntheir spellbinding live performances and DJ\nsets in front of a local crowd, and also discovered and nurtured new artists and DJs,\ngiving them the confidence and freedom to\ncreate their own music.\nTonight (13/02/97) will see a rare appearance by Air Liquide and the rest of the\nCologne collective in London at the 333 Club\nin Old Street (333 Old Street, London EC1)\nfrom \"10 till death\" as the publicity points\nout! 1 counted over ten named artists plus\nguests, so there will be something for everyone on two floors of teeming action. Look out\nin particular for live sets by Air Liquide, The\nBionaut, Khan and Frank Heiss. On the decks\nyou can enjoy the talents of Freddie Fresh,\nStrobocop, Kron and Thomas Thorn. This all\ncomes highly recommended from the Electric\nCafe.\nI leave you with the words of a journalist\nwho said, \" A recent single was charmingly\ntitled Don't Fuck With Cologne. Far better to\nlet Cologne fuck with you.\"\n\"There is no law except the law that there\nis no law\"\nAir Liquide - Twice Zero is Zero\n\"Nothing is true; everything is permitted\"\nHassan-I Sabbath, The Old Man Of\nThe Mountains\n(Excerpts from this article were taken\nfrom Trance Europe Express 3)\nHere are the times for the Electric Cafe\nthis week:\nSunday night: midnight till 2am Tuesday night: 10pm till 11pm Both shows are on IC Radio (The Student\nRadio Network). As usual, we'll be covering\nthe best in new and classic cutting-edge electronic music.\n@l; \u00a9k fammi n' Unit gets some\nlight in his eyes.\n\n"

It's always\nthe same old thing, one mop headed, swaying blok e sings, a sweaty one on the drums, two playing guitars, and some lig ger that plays the keyboard or tambourine or just sort of dances\naround, i.e. Bez and that's the\nPhiladelphia Bluntz * *\nAs the production of dance\nmusic becomes more pro l if ic, the emergence of what\ncan only be described as easy listening dance music grows. The\nmusic itself is thus a contradiction\nin terms, what should be making\nyou get up and dance, simply wafts\naround you, having little, if any,\neffect.\nPhiladelphia Bluntz are a clear\nexample of this. Their music is\ndrum and bass based, but even at\nits most involving moments only\nstandard five piece. Dawn are different, they piss around with their\nline up more often than President\nClinton shags his secretaries, and\nthat's a lot! One minute there's only two of them on a track, producing a minimal melody. Then the\nnext thing you know three people\nare singing, sometimes with scary\nBeach Boys like harmonies, three\non guitars, two on keyboards and\nthank God only one on the drums.\nFigure that one out with only five\nmembers!! Not only do they do\nthat but they also employ the most\ninnovative instruments this side of\nthe moon. Interesting noises are\nproduced by Phasers, Speedway,\nHollow-bone Nose Drone, MC303, HaH a, Numerics, Cigarettes, and\nfinally a Drone-Stick Squealer.\nHmm very interesting indeed.\nDown to the music, Dawn produce a pleasant, if not slightly dark\nsounding noise. They are not too\nheavily guitar orientated and can\noften sound like one of the better\ninspires the tapping of a foot. I suppose what we have is almost\nambient, but the feeling is generally less sleepy. The mood un sur pris ingly is quite neutral, but does\nshow at times potential to go\nwhere you' d never expect.\nStand out tracks are the funky\nBlue, and Hullabaloo which is probably the most involving track on\nthe album, if only for its slightly\ngrating vocal section. The album\nthen finishes with Intro, which suggests the album should be on\nbands of the early eighties. Tracks\nlike Windy Miller are sung in a mildly depressing monotone that adds\natmosphere and meaning to the\nwords. However at times their use\nof crazy instruments detracts from\ntheir essentially best material. The\nmore simplistic melodies are supported very capably by their miri ad of vocalists with lyrics being meaningful and full of emotion. On more\nthan one occasion I found myself\ncomparing the band and much of\nthe music they produce to the\nmaterial produced by Frank Black,\nformally of the Pixies. On tracks like\nSgt Crowley, Dawn sound more like\na mixture of The Cult and Soft Cell.\nMy personal favourite is Radars,\nwhich is a more modern sounding,\nup beat track very reminiscent of\nthe better, new, British bands\naround at the moment. Next big\nthing, who knows, this could be\njust the Dawn for the Replicants. El\nRamzi\nrepeat, the standard setting for all\nmy background listening.\nOverall a mediocre album that\ninspires little, but will help aid sleep\nfor spring term insomniacs. CI\nJames\nKRISTIN HERSH\nStrange Angels * * *\nThrowing Muse Kristin Hersh\nmakes beautiful music.\nSparse, precise acoustic\narrangements of articulate sopra-no, expertly picked guitar, arpeggio ed harpsichord and only the\noccasional tambourine providing\npercussion; the emphasis is direct-ed solely to each song itself.\nHersh's lively chord structures and\nlullaby melodies at first misdirect\nand then bring into sharp relief\nsome chilling libretto, much in the\nfashion of a more subdued and\nless world weary Kurt Cobain.\nThe first two tracks do little to\ninspire but then are followed by\nseven consecutive recordings of\nundeniable brilliance and understated power. Touching on subject\nmatters many artists shy from,\nStrange Angels is an uneasy listen.\nClever wordplay and pleading\nemotion combine well in the first\nhalf but the second leans toward\nself indulgence; the simplicity of\nthe arrangement. If this record had\nthe five weaker tracks removed,\nand with a more open-minded and\nless indulgent producer than\nHersh, I would have been so much\nmore gushing in my praise. With\nluck the forthcoming Throwing\nMuses album will be better. If, if, if.\nWhat might have been, what might\nhave been... El Mr.Trout\nPHILADELPHIA BLUNTZ\n\n"

Yes, master of\nchaos, chief of destruction and shat-terer of dreams is here to pl auge another batch of hopeful candidates.\nWhat? You don't know who I am? I am the all-powerful New\nElection, and it is within my grasp to\neliminate the weak and the stupid\nfrom these elections. I'm standing for\nall posts, so if you think that all the\ncandidates of that position are nothing but pitiful, unworthy retches, then\nvote for ME and I shall destroy them!\nBut greatest evil is yet to come -if I am victorious, the elections will be\nheld again. Ha ha ha! HA HAH A HAAAAAA!\nJames Carter Deputy President (Finance and Services)\nMeeting the needs of your Union\nNext academic year will undoubtedly\nbe the most important year in the\nmanagement of your Union. This is\nbecause for the first time in ten years,\nall the union clubs and societies, services and trading outlets will be financially supported from within the\nSouth Kensington campus. However,\nthere are bound to many teething\nproblems and I do not want anyone\nto suffer because of this. Not everything can be anticipated in this matter\nso the Deputy President of Finance\nand Services must be able to respond\nto problems both fast and effectively.\nFortunately, I know how to carry out\nwhat could be an overwhelming task.\nI have experience in the management\nof people and union finances from the\nclub and society level right through to\nmy current position as Recreational\nClubs Committee Chairman. I have\nlearnt that the only way to make sure\nthings don't go wrong is by implementing a system of proper instruction and effective communication\nthroughout the membership of the\nUnion. Believe it or not, much of this\nsystem is already in place. All it needs\nis a bit of forward thinking and the\nright person to implement it. You will\nall have seen what happens when this\nis not done.\nPlease remember that your Union is\nhere to support your needs and\nnobody else's. Better suited services\nincluding welfare, catering and\naccommodation support may well be\nneeded over and above what already\nneeds improving. I will be there as a member of the team to help implement suitable changes within the\nfinancial constraints of the union.\nSadly, all this is not guaranteed to\nhappen unless you vote for James\nCarter: Deputy President, Finance and\nServices.\nDave Wharton Deputy President (Finance and Services)\nExperience, personality, enthusiasm,\ncommitment. A good candidate\nneeds not only to have them all, but\nto show them too. It is my job in\nthese weeks running up to the ele c tion, to show you that I do.\nThe position of DP(F&S) involves the\nday to day handling of the Unions\nFinances. Although not described as\nsuch, it is a job, and one which\ndemands the same high standards as\nmy current one. As a computer consultant to BT I work in a team, and it\nrequires the four qualities above, and\nmore.\nThe DP(F&S) sits on, and chairs various committees, and has to keep in\nconstant contact with other Union\nstaff and members. You could have\nthe best accountant in the world, but\nif you can't approach him with your\nproblems, then you're wasting your\ntime. A club treasurer may not understand how to create a budget, or\nmight not understand what a Five\nYear Plan is. Hitting them with, what\nthey might see as mum bo jumbo\nfinance speak, is not going to help.\nThey're not going to learn, and they're\nnot going to go away and get it right,\nwhich makes the DP's job harder.\nWhy not just explain it properly to\nthem in the first place, and help them\nunderstand. That way things are\nmade easier for everyone, and it\nhelps the Union run like the well oiled\nengine that it should be.\nThis year we will have students arriving at IC who will be encountering\nfinancial difficulty with the introduction of tuition fees. 1 believe the\nUnion needs to cater for this new\nproblem, and provide information,\nand help about the fees, and any\nimplications they may have. 1 want to\nsee ICU services keep their high stan-dard, and offer more. I want the job.\nAdam Cherrington Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)\nImperial College will enter a new era\nin October with the arrival of the\nmedical students on the South\nKensington campus. This will\nundoubtedly effect the members of\nthe 200 or so clubs and societies of\nICU, whose interests are the responsibility of the DP(CS^). The current\nDP(C&S) is already dealing with the\nwell-publicised BUSA situation and\ncouncils decision for hybrid entry.\nThis is a position with which I am in\ntotal agreement as a means for\nsmoother integration before the\neventual, but seemingly distant, total\nmerger of all clubs competing in\nBUSA competitions. There has been\nconcern that other clubs and societies\nwill be forced to merge with their\nequivalent on other campuses, a situation I cannot see happening and,\ndue to the fact that many clubs may\nbe detrimental ly effected by a large\nincrease in membership and are not\nunder the restricting regulations of\nBUSA-like organisations, do not sup-port.\nSo why vote for me? I am currently\nthe Tour Manager of 1CU Rugby Club\norganising a tour to South Africa in\nJuly '98 for both medical and non-medical players. This position has\ngiven me the unique experiences of\nworking within the Union structure\nwhilst dealing with College Officials\nand students of all disciplines, as well\nas people and businesses from outside the education system. 1 also have\na keen interest in the theatre and outdoor pursuits, and although not a member of the relevant clubs in 1CU,1 have been a member of societies outside of college, hopefully proving that\nI am not what is generally referred to\nin the states as a Jock.\nMay 1 finish by saying vote 1 for Adam\nCherrington\n\n"

    "content": "3 February 1998 ARTS23 SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON IN CHE MENG EASY ACCESS (FOR THE BOYS)\nClaire Dowie\nT his is the new play by Claire\nDowie - hailed by some as\nthe female answer to the\n\"angry young men\" of modern the-at re in which she explores the delicate issue of childhood sexual\nabuse. The central character\nMichael is a prostitute who believes\nthat he was abused by his father as\na small child, and the play charts\nhis changing attitudes toward his\nfather and his actions. At first\nMichael denies that his father's treatment of him was abuse at all,\ninsisting that he still has a good relationship with his father.\nDuring the play, Michael is\nmaking a video diary containing all\nthe most intimate details of his life.\nHe spends a large amount of time\nspeaking out front to the camera,\nwith the recording being simultaneously projected onto a gigantic\nscreen on stage. As he relates his\nlife story, we see his attitude toward\nhis father gradually changing under\nthe influences of the best friend\nGary and boyfriend Matt. Michael\ngoes through the whole spectrum of\nreactions, from denial, through\nanger toward his father, to the realisation that his father's abuse of him\nhad somehow made him feel special and loved - exactly the opposite\nof what one would expect.\nThroughout the early part of the\nplay Michael's father Ed hovers in\nthe background, his constant presence symbolic of the far reaching\neffect he has had on Michael's life.\nWhenever Michael and Matt become physically close, Ed\nappears behind them and begins to\nact out the same kissing and touching that they are involved in. This is\nvery obviously intended only as a metaphor, but nonetheless a surreal effect. Do wie also uses the\ndevice of the juxtaposition of different scenes, so that the action\nmoves fluidly between separate\nconversations between Michael and others, and characters can be\npassively present without being\ndirectly involved.\nMichael returns to his father's home to find that he has taken on\nlive-in help for the bar which he\nruns, in the form of Ruth who now\nlives upstairs with her young son\nJake. Michael is immediately wor-ried, soon becoming terrified that\nhis father is now abusing Jake, so\nthat he makes every effort to persuade Ruth to leave. His father\nchooses this time to discuss with\nhim the events of the past, playing\non Michael's resentment towards\nhis mother, who left when he was\nsix years old, and saying that he\nnever really did anything, nothing\nsignificant, and that it only happened once, after all. After this\nMichael really begins to doubt the\naccuracy of his own memories, half\nbelieving his father's platitudes, but\nis also hurt at the idea of his\nfather's having found a substitute\nfor him, in Jake. The plot comes to\na horrifying climax, and only then\ndoes the full intricacy of the subject\nmatter become apparent, showing\nthat we can never be completely\naware of the nature of the abuse\nwhich is going on. After seeing the climax, the\nviewer's impression of the entire\nplay is dramatically altered, and it\nseems to me that Claire Dowie has\nwritten the play almost solely with\nthe intention of creating the situation in which such a climax can\noccur, with the result that many\nscenes appear lame or irrelevant.\nThe cast rise above this to some\nextent, in particular Malcolm James\nin the portrayal of the relationship\nbetween Matt and Michael, and\nPeter Marinker, who captured well\nthe mild menace inherent in Ed;\nalthough I was unimpressed by\nNatasha Langridge's somewhat stilted performance. Despite the\nfact that neither the potential of the\nwriting, nor that of the several\nclever devices used, is fulfilled, the\nplay succeeds in raising many interesting questions, and challenging\nthe accepted view of what constitutes sexual abuse.\nAbi\nDetails on diary pages\nHOT MIKADO\nCXWMS Light Opera Society\nALBERT HERRING\nBenjamin Britten\nY ou're in London, arguably the cultural\ncapital of the world and you think that,\nmaybe sometime you might possibly\nlike to see an opera. But you're in London\nwhich is famous for it's extortionate ticket\nprices and you can only just afford a pint or\nten down the bar. And then you remember\nthat you're a scientist at IC, so where did you\nget such a stupid idea from in the first place?\nFor those of you who might have even the\nslightest of cultural tendencies, here's your\nchance. Opera for \u00a33 and just across the\nroad from DaVinci's. The Britten Theatre is\none of the best opera venues in London and\neven the cheap seats are excellent.\nBased on Guy de Maupassant's short\nstory, Le Rosier de Madame Husson, the\nopera is set in the fictional East Anglian\ncoastal town of Loxford at the turn of the century. Those of you who are familiar with either\nthat area or who simply have a general idea of\nBritish small-town mentality will be able to\nrelate very easily to the characters and set-ting. Self-appointed moral guardian of\nLoxford, Lady Billows is discussing candidates\nfor the town's May Queen with a group of\nlocal representatives (schoolmistress, vicar,\nmayor, and policeman); however, the suitability of all the candidates is called into question by Lady Billows' housekeeper Florence\nwho's notebook is at the ready. Eventually\nthey have to settle for a May King instead and\nthe honour is to be given to Albert Herring - a rather simple chap who works for his mother\nat the grocer's shop. Unfort-un at ely for the\nmoral majority, the prize money and a practical joke where his lem-on a de is laced with\nrum, provide him with the conditions to break\nout of the stifling constraints of the village\nsociety: this opera is, in the end, a coming-of-age story.\nThis chamber opera can be appreciated\non many levels; Britten's character is ation is\nreminiscent of the Mozart comic operas: the\nvocal writing for each individual character perfectly portrays the particular neurosis and disposition of that person. Thus, Lady Billows'\nmusic is full of musical outbursts and arpeggiated figures which mirror her self-righteous\nmoral and patronising personality. There are\nso many other details which may go unnoticed on one's first hearing but that won't spoil one's appreciation of it; underneath the\nlight-hearted exterior there lies quite a profound message with music of equal depth,\nconfirming Britten as one of the greatest\noperatic composers of this century.\nStephen Tarlton\nDetails on diary page\nH ot Mikado\" is the famous operetta by\nGilbert and Sullivan, given a'40s twist. The\nsongs and settings remain the same, with\nthe only difference being the suits and some\nextremely poor American accents.\nThe story involves Nanki-Poo, a wandering min-st rel, travelling to Titipu in search of Yum-Yum, his\nlost love. On his arrival, he finds her engaged to\nher guardian, the Lord High Execut-i one r. After a lot\nof sing-ing and dancing, the lovers are reunited and\nlive happily ever after.\nThe set was minimal, and in a vaguely Japanese\nstyle. The Gentlemen of Japan looked like extras\nfrom \"Dick Tracey\" in their rainbow suits, whilst the\nladies were all Susie Wong in skimpy dresses. It\nwas all very colourful, with a fairly mixed quality of\nsinging from the chorus. The leads proved consistently excellent. The musical provided an evening\nof enjoyable, light entertainment, with some very\nfunny mom-ents. Shame you missed it, really.\nA. Griffin\n\n"

    "content": "13 February 1998 COLUMNS 9\n%*\nOriginally, I was going to have a rant about the par lou s state of the\nConstituent College Unions, but\nthe events of Sunday mean that\nthis will have to wait. Iam referring\nto the death of Enoch Powell. Even\nat a place as politically apathetic as\nImperial, this is a tricky subject to\nhandle. For many, he is remembered only for that speech in\nBirmingham on 24th April 1968,\n'The Rivers of Blood.' This was\nbranded racist by Ted Heath and\nled to his immediate dismissal\nfrom the Shadow Cabinet. An inflammatory and, it was later to be\nshown, overly alarmist speech, it\nsharply divided public opinion and\nled to the unusual spectacle of\nLondon's docker s marching on Westminster to defend a Tory\npolitician. However, it had the\nunfortunate effect of pushing one\nof the finest political mind of the\ncentury to the sidelines, leaving the\nrest of his work overlooked by so\nmany. He is widely credited with\ninventing Thatcherism, espousing\nmonetarism decades before it was\nembraced by the Conservatives.\nHe mooted the idea of privatisation in the early 1960s and laid the\nfoundations for the breaking of\nconsensus politics in Britain, the\nremorseless march to the left,\nwhich drove the country onto the\nrocks. His views on Europe, dismissed by Heath, were frighteningly accurate. 'The Community is\ndesigned to be a political unit, with\ncommon internal\nand external\npolicies, the\nsame currency,\nthe same treaties. All this\nmeans a single\ngovernment, and\ntherefore a com mon parliament\nbased on one\nelectorate.' He said this in 1970,\nand the full\nimpact is only now being felt. Such\nwas the strength of his feeling on\nEurope, he urged people to vote\nLabour in 1974. He was the\nsharpest mind in the Commons, who would ruthlessly crush opponents with his frighteningly powerful intellect, his principal strength\nbut possibly one of his weak\npoints. There will never be another.\nI find myself in the odd position\nof leaping to the Rector's defence,\nsomething which probably\nunnerves him as much as it does\nme. Once again, our friends in the\nICU Environmental Society are\nbleating on about Imperial's fund-ing. Suzanne\nAigrain states\nthat IC's funding\n'is increasingly\ncoming from Oil\ncompanies with\na reputation for\nappa ling environmental destruction [sic],\ndenial of Global\nWarming...' Needless to say,\nf\"\"+ this dubious,\nsweeping statement is rubbish. The\nhighly respected Worldwatch Institute in Washington has just\npraised the efforts of BP, an\nImperial funding source, in investing in solar and wind energy. The\nChairman of BP announced last\nyear that his company accepted\nthat the burning of fossil\nfuels was linked to changes\nin the Earth's climate. Yet the\nEnvironmental Society still saw fit\nto disrupt a BP lecture held at\nImperial recently in a manner that\ncan only be described as childish.\nMs Aigrain begins to reveal her true\nagenda when she moans about oil\ncompanies developing new fields.\nAs she well knows it is not the role\nof a supplier to suppress its own\nsales or fail to meet the demand\nfor its products. That is the role of\ngovernments. Perhaps she feels\nthat the battle against lung cancer\nwould be best served by Philip\nMorris deciding to stop the manufacture of cigarettes? The clincher\nis her preference for 'state funds'\nover industrial sponsorship. As with\nmany 'environmentalists', her real\ndisagreement seems to be with the\ncapitalist system, rather than environmental issues, which serve\nmerely as a vehicle for these cry p to-socialist views. You can best\nhelp save the planet by not clogging up Felix with these silly distortions. THE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO GETTING A FIRST with COLIN DALE\nAbstract\nAdmittedly it is less so than some work you\nJ will have to do, but that doesn't stop it being\n' aching ly tedious.\n' Introduction\nYou may be forgiven for thinking that the\ni purpose of writing lab reports is to give po ten It i al employees an idea of your ability to com I muni cate technical information clearly and pre-! c is ely. But these skills are only of marginal use\nI to most companies, who are looking increasing-| ly for employees who can deliberately mis in| form and distort data to their advantage. They\n| are also searching for soulless automatons who I can routinely perform the most mind-numbing-I ly boring tasks for very little reward. That is why\n\u2022 lab reports are marked by weight rather than\n\u2022 content. You don't seriously believe that any\u2022 one could be bothered to read them do you?\n| Theory\nYou are provided with up-to-date, well\n. maintained equipment with which to assess the\n! validity of scientific theory or improve your\n! practical skills, under the supervision of helpful\n' demonstrators. In science, a theory can never\n' be proved, only disproved (or something).\n' Basically, this means that anything that comes\nI under this heading is about to be proved utterly\nI false as soon as you walk into the lab.\nI Method\nI First of all, you have to find yourself a lab\nI partner. The choice must be made carefully. It\nI Part Four: The Lab Report\nshould be someone who will co-operate with\nyou, support you, and when the going gets really tough, someone on whom you can offload all\nresponsibility while you go down the pub.\nBasically, anyone will do as long as they're not\nbigger than you - that way you will sustain less\ndamage when things get violent. You may end\nup with someone who only turns up every other\nTuesday, invariably with a bad hangover (and\nyou don't even have lab on Tuesdays).\nAlternatively, you may get someone who is less\nconscientious than yourself.\nAfter three hours in the library desperately\ntrying to understand what the lab script is on\nabout, you finally give up and make a start on it\nanyway. After all, it never stopped Einstein, did\nit? Never mind the knowing smirk that crept\nover the technician's face when you told him\nwhich experiment you were doing; this is going\nto be OK. That illusion persists until you see the\napparatus. The diffraction grating / bubbling vat\nof chemicals / rat's testicles you are to be working on bear absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the description in the text. Instead, you\nhave a equipment that looks as if it was salvaged from the engine room of the Titanic, and\nfunctions equally well. After two hours of cursing at each other through clouds of black\nsmoke, you and your partner discover that\nyou've tried to connect a wire the wrong way\nround. Of course, you could have asked a demonstrator right at the start, but a couple of\nhours of futile effort is a small price to pay in\norder to avoid the humiliation of being patronised by a sad post grad who didn't manage to\npull while he was doing his first degree.\nDemonstrators are always around (usually a bar)\nto demonstrate how easy it can be to earn eight\nquid an hour.\nThings continue in a similar vein for several\nweeks, until you suddenly realise that it is the\nlast session. You haven't even got any results\nfor the first part yet, and your partner was last\nseen rolling around in a gutter singing 'I 'll Be\nThere For You'. So there is only one course of\naction open to you, the one that comes\nbetween blind panic and hard liquor, namely\nfabrication.\nResults\nThe University of London takes a very dim\nview of bogus data, but I think it's fine as long\nas you don't get caught. This is what statistics\nis for. No-one understands statistics, so any\nresults can look reasonably good as long as the\nerrors are justified in a completely incomprehensible way. Choose a formula (the bigger the\nbetter, it need n't mean anything) and churn\nthose numbers out.\nDiscussion\nThe less said the better at this stage.\nConclusion\nYour practical experiences may or may not\nagree with my theory.\n\n"

    "content": "MORE LETTERS 13 February 1998\nCONSIDERED\nOPINION\nDear Jeremy,\nHaving a foot in both camps, it\nwas interesting to see that Felix has\nfinally come out resolutely against\nthe CC Us. It appears that they are\nself-serving, irrelevant and misunderstand their role.\nAlthough I cannot agree that\nthe CC Us should be abolished, the\naccusations have some weight.\nThere is still confusion as to exactly what the CC Us should be achi ev ing, although there are signs of\nchange, with 2 sabbaticals in the\nICS M and wholesale structural\nchange in the RCS. CfkGCU's inactivity over the past year is not a reason for the abolition of the entire\nstructure. CC Us have declined slowly over the past 70 years or so,\ndue to much larger social changes\nin what people identify with.\nStudents apply through UC AS to\n'Imperial College' and only hear of\nthe CC Us when they get here.\nMany do not know which C CU their\ndepartment belong to. At the top\nend, the introduction of ProRectors even removed some of the\nduties of the Deans.\nCC Us now find that their role\ncovers academic affairs, some we l fare, social meetings, alumni association recruitment and career help.\nSome of these are covered by\ndepartmental societies - which are\npart of the C CU structure. Felix\nthinks that these jobs would be better done if 'properly run', (i.e. by\n1CU). It is also of the opinion that\nstudents can't be trusted to run our\nunions for ourselves. Who else is\ngoing to run them? The position of\nDep Rep, for example, is by its\nnature departmental. The existence\nof the C CU acts as an extra\ndevolved layer of academic sup-port, with certain jobs within its\nremit. The ICU s a bbs do not need\nto worry about Jim's unfair lab\nmark, but a Dep Rep/AAO could\nsort it out before some ICU drone\nstorms in, guns blazing. These people sit on plenty of high-level committees so that they can bring these\nproblems to attention. I cannot see\nthat ICU will be able to do that any\nbetter, and the idea that C CU academic representatives are not\napproachable or efficient is an\ninsult to those that work hard in an\nunpopular job.\nIt is said they shouldn't be\ncalled 'Unions' - again they are not\n- they are called 'Constituent\nCollege Unions', part of ICU. There\nis no doubt that the main student's union is ICU, and it does its job\nvery well. If this serves to create\nconfusion, then it is the job of publications like this to dispel that. The\nnames and crests, older than\nImperial itself, are not going any-where. The alumni associations and\nmany others wouldn't stand for it.\nIf the CC Us are shells of their former selves, than so be it. But let\nthem do the job that they are supposed to do, and can do properly.\nYours ever,\nHamish Common Felix columnist and Guildsheet\nEditor\nUNCONSIDERED\nOPINION\nbah, humbug and all that\nmalarkey. what a thoroughly crap\neditorial you seem to have written\nthis week.\nI mean, just cos C&.G are going\nthrough a rough patch (something\nwhich has admittedly been going\non for the best part of a year and a half, since they got some strippers\nin for their fresher s welcome) is no\nreason to call for the abolition of all\nthe CCU's and then well., lets just\nsay that your argue ment s range\nfrom the pathetic to the badly\nresearched.\nThe current roles of the C CU involves providing a network of\nsocial and academic support for\ntheir students, this doesn't involve\nattempting to run any bars (with\nthe possible exception of the RCSU\nbeer festival). Your e script ion of\nthe situation with a bad lecturer is\nabout right to be honest (though\nyou left out the year representatives) but then surely anyone who has done any reasonable amount of\nwork with the union (especially\nthose doing a sabbatical) must\nrealise that trying to get college to\nadmit they are wrong is nearly\nimpossible, and getting a lecturer\nto change their ways is nigh on\nimpossible, a year is a damn good result for most of the problems dis-cussed. Fortuneatly a lot of dep\nreps don't have this extremely narrow minded attitude, and are prepared to put in work for things\nwhich won't directly benefit them\nbut make life better for those who will follow in later years.\nas a final comment the situation\nwith any h of the CCU's can be readily compared with that of felix. The\nquality of this years news coverage\nhas., to be honest been crap, but is\nthis the esteemed editors fault...\nwell no, it;'s more the fault of the\nstudents woh don't get off their\narse s and write articles for felix\n(though an editor whose election\nupdate was obviously done long\nbefore the second candidate for DP\nF&S signed up yesterday morning\ndoes imply a certain laziness in the\nquest for ground breaking news).\nanyway thats about that.\nStuart Jenkins\nOrdinarily, I try to refrain from\nranting on in the letters pages.\nAfter all, they're supposed to be\nfor your opinions, not mine.\nHowever, I cannot permit such\nilliterate, ignorant twaddle as Mr\nJenkins has seen fit to make public to go unquestioned in Felix.\nFirstly, describing the C&C Union's current state of total\nineptitude as a 'bad patch' is\nrather like calling World War Two\n'unfortunate1. In researching the\nstory ('C&G Union 'A Joke\", Felix\n1106), one of my reporters\nattempted to contact the C&G Union fourteen times over three\ndays, both by telephone and in\nperson, and at no point was the\nC& GU office manned or even\nunlocked. Quite how they are\nsupposed to \"provide a network\nof social and academic support\"\nsolely by telepathy was not\nexplained in your letter. As for\naccusing me of bad research, 1\nwonder how much in-depth fact-finding you required before concluding that CCUs don't run any\nbars when, as most students are\nwell aware, ICSMSU currently\nruns two. The fact that control of\nthese bars will soon be handed\nover to ICU serves to highlight\nthe CCUs' increasing obsolescence. It is ironic that immediately\nafter damning my arguments as\n\"pathetic\" you then feel that my\ncomments on bad lecturers -which formed the bulk of my article - were \"about right\". Adopting\nthe fatalist attitude that dogs so\nmany at IC, you write that initiating change in the college system\nis \"impossible\". If so, then why do\nyou advocate continued investment of time and money into trying to do just that?\nFortunately, my own opinions\nare a little less cynical. I do not\nbelieve that changing the system\nand forcing lecturers to embrace\nthe wishes of their students is\nimpossible - though it is difficult.\nThis is why I argued to abandon\nthe sinking ship of C CU social\nprovision and concentrate on the\nfar more important aim of effective academic representation for\nstudents.\nIncidently sentences should\nbegin with a capital letter.

    "content": "13 February 1998 MUSIC 19\nSINGLES The Hybirds - See me through\nAlright tune, sounding a bit repetitive but the\nguitar drives the song on. Lilys - A nanny in Manhatten\nThis is the new Levis theme which lacks the\ncolour and energy seen in the ad. It's a bit too\np hunk y for me!\nDandywarhols - Every day should be a holiday\nHeard these guys on the radio a few times and\nthey seem to be getting OK reviews. But tome it sounds like an express train going nowhere\nfast.\nSimon Warner - The wrong girl\nUmm, the song starts off well but then the\nrespectability of it declines steeply when he\nstarts singing. Better leave this one alone!\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON1 Hinda Hicks - If you want me\nThis is Hinda Hick's debut single of ' 9 8 and is da\nlicks. She delivers ap hunk y flavoured track with\nthe sample Too Hot from Kool and the Gang.\nShe is going to blast on to the R'n B scene with\nthis tune. Lets hope she makes it big in '98, she\ndefinitely got the features-no doubt!!\nShelter - Whole wide world\nThis is an American alternative indie group with\nsome Hindu influences, Hare Krishna! Song\nsounds better as you listen to it.\nStereophonies - Local boy in the photograph\nQuite a good kick in' tune from the 'Phonics with\nsome blasting drum beats. Seems like this is\ngoing to be a popular one.\nAddict - Red Bird\nThis is a slow tempo indie track which we've all\nheard before. It grows on you after a few listens\nbut still is a little downbeat.\nStrangelove - Another night in\nStrangelove, strange boys, delivering a catchy\nyet annoying tune singing some really interesting lyrics about having 'another night in'. It'sO K. Save Ferris - World is new\nHow can 1 sum up this tune. It contains some\nreally corny crap trumpet work but gets a bit\nbetter when it stops. This new band have had\nlimited success in the U.S. and 1 can't see why?\nLets hope they do better here, yeah mate!\nMellowbac - Illusion\nThis is a slick mellow tune from a rap group\nbased in Germany. It consists of two laid back\nrappers spin n in' their web of wicked words\nbacked up by some smooth female vocals. It\ncontains some French rap verses sounding similar to Alliance Ethnik with their groovy sounds.\nInteresting to see how they do in '98, they definitely got the skill z! Deni Hines - Delicious\nRadio edit has ap hunk y laid back flavour with\nsome groovy piano and guitar back in' it up. There is also aC Swing remix featuring Don-E which does nothing for the track and also an\nupbeat Cold mix which houses up the track for\nthe worst.\nFinley Quaye - Your love gets sweeter\nThis is a more up tempo track from Finley who sings about the joys of a woman! It is not quite\nas good as what he has come out with before\nbut it is still a catchy little tune and sure of success. Chantal Kreviazuk - Cod made me\nShe is a23 year old Canadian pianist, singer,\nsongwriter with an Allanis Morrisette flavour but\nstill quite individualistic. She has a soft yet powerful voice and most of her tracks are heartfelt\nand moving! One to watch out for. Ohhhh,\nChantal!\nMm Primal Scream - If They Move Kill 'Em 1\n1\nThis is a groove laden track, with an\u00ab^l excellent bass heavy under-current. It is\none of the number of top class tracks off their\nmost recent long player, Vanishing Point. It's only going to be released for a week, so give it\na listen, it's worth it just to catch a listen of the\n'Scream's cover of Darklands by those ancient\nindie maestros, The jesus And Mary Chain.\nSix By Seven - 88-92-96\nUnfortunately this is depressing and boring,\nmuch in the similar vein as Portishead, with the\nexception of extremely whiny vocals. Apparently\nthis band has been touted as one of the breakers for '98, all 1 can say is don't believe the\nhype.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON2 Cornershop - Brimful Of Asha\nIf you've been listening to the radio recently you\nare bound to have heard this beautiful slice of\npop by the previously (nearly) unheard of\nCornershop. This is an ode to famous Hindi\nsingers (Asha and others) and much loved vinyl\n45s. It is essential to investigate the remixes on\nthe rest of the single, they're on another level\nfrom the original single edit.\nPitchshifter - Genius\nThis is described as a fusion of metal and tech-no, although it is more similar to a pathetic\nattempt at trying to gain some commercial\nground by introducing a dance y beat to some\npoor metal RAW W K. Grandaddy - Everything Beautiful Is far Away\nLo-fi-ness at its worst, it is bland, and uninteresting. It is advisable to avoid this record with a passion.\nJason\nTH A BOMB! Yeah, Yeah it's that time again Felix,\nFriday its must be the Tha Bomb. Sit back\nrelax and just read you know where it's at!\nComing up you got all the usual shit.... news,\nsingles, you know all that, but y 'all also got\nsome extra stuff and its all free of charge.\nNow for some news, the ooo ohs and the\naaaa ahs of the RnB world. 1 heard this story\nfrom one of my boys on Saturday, I don't know whether its true, but who cares about\nthe truth; Lil Kim and Foxy Brown are both\ntouring with the Puff Daddy crew over stateside and if my boy is right they got a little\npissed off with each other and it all ended in\nnails at 10 paces (every bad boy's perfect\nnight, two bad girls fighting it out in the\nmud...ooo ooh). Oh and by the way for those\nwho bought tickets for the Puffy gig in January\nit seems that the Puff Daddy was too ill to\ncome over here, but good enough to go over\nto the other coast and see Michael Jackson\nlast month. Rumours of a Jacko-Puffy collaboration started late last year, well they may\nnot just be rumours anymore. Jacko's kid sister has added an extra date to her tour in\nJune...my question is why?, the last album\nwas so fucked up I can't imagine anyone\ngoing to see the tour, only reason 1 can think\nto go is if she plays loads of old tunes.\nOn the album front the wicked Jay-Z album, In My Lifetime Vol. I, has just been re-released, the record company probably looking to generate more sales on the interest\ncreated by Wishing On A Star, you know this\nis gonna be a huge crossover hit...the British\npublic love the old remade classics. Just\nswitching to a Drum'n 'Bass groove for a sec-on d, the new Goldie album is at long last\ngonna get a release, titled Saturnz Return,\nthis double album includes the dope tune\nDigital with KRS1. The Ride, a film that will\nprobably never make it to our big screens has\na soundtrack that's already out and is in the\nprocess of blowing up on the underground.\nI 've only heard a couple of the tracks but I 've\ngot to say they were phat ness itself and if the\nrest of the album lives up to the hype surrounding it then we got some major shit on\nour hands. The Weekend is a wicked party\ntune and The Worst from Onyx and The Wu\nblows your mine....I don't wanna say anymore\ncause u got a review coming up next week.\nTo finish off 1 gotta mention a little story\n1 heard last week apparently while a friend of mine was now in IC radio he heard\nsomebody saying that while 1 start off writing\nlike some sort of rude boy my writing style\nslowly gets more and more normal towards\nthe end. Now I read thru' last weeks column\nand look at that it's probably true, but\nthat doesn't worry me...u worry me for reading my column and analysing the fucking\nthing. This little story encases all the shit that\ngoes with Imperial rather than props for the\nwriting the fucking thing I get shit because my\nstyle isn't consistent.\nShoutouts to the Chem. Eng. home girls,\nyou know who you are! I'm out. CT\nMilen\n\n"

Editor:\nEditor\nFeature \u00ab on Aiok Iha\nrout\nLetters to Felix...\nRECTORIAL\nRESPONSE\nDear Editor,\nIam writing to comment on the\nletter in last week's Felix about the\noil industry, and although there is a great deal to be said 1 shall confine\nmyself to just three aspects.\nFirst there are concerns that the\nassociation of the College with the\noil industry may be unhealthy or in\nsome way damaging. Since its earliest days the ethos of the College\nhas been to foster research and\nteaching across a full spectrum\nfrom the pure to the highly applied,\nand to establish mutually beneficial\npartnerships and strategic alliances\nwith industry, including the oil\nindustry. Indeed the Royal School\nof Mines was established with the\nprime purpose of supporting the\nex tractive industries and has for\nmany years worked closely with\nthem. Like your correspondent,\nmany of us in the College are nostalgic for the days when Government support of research\nwas stronger, but that view\nappears not to be shared by any\nmajor political party. On the other\nhand, we do not find ourselves significantly constrained by our industrial contracts. We work on the\ngeneral principle of deciding what\nwe would like to do, and then finding an industrial partner who has\nthe same objectives and is prepared to meet the costs.\nThe College has recently led the\ncountry, and possibly the world, in\ncreating a new academic depart-ment, the T.H. Huxley School, that\nbrings together both the disciplines\nnecessary for the extraction of natural resources and those that focus\non understanding and managing\nthe environment. This change has\nbeen welcomed by industry and is\nsimply an expression of the fact\nthat ex tractive practices that were\nacceptable thirty years ago on a planet with half its present population and based on the understanding available at that time, are not\nviable today. The world will continue to need to extract its natural\nresources, and I believe that the\nCollege can play a leading role in\nfinding ways to do this at acceptable environmental cost. To have\nany practical influence we need to\nwork in close collaboration with\nindustry.\nSecond, many undesirable consequences were attributed to the\nactions of major oil companies.\nWhether we like it or not, much of\nthe twentieth century prosperity of\nthe western world and much of the\nimprovement in standard of living\nthat has come about in the developing world is attributable to\nhydrocarbons, and in particular to\ntheir use in the internal combustion\nengine - a blessing that has in part\nbecome a bane. However, blanket\ndemonization of individual companies or industries because of particular perceived failures is not bal-an ced, sensible, or constructive.\nThat said, Ido not believe that\nthere is any large company in the\nworld, in the hydrocarbons field or\nany other, that with hindsight does\nnot believe that it could and should\nhave done things better. Overall\none has to look at a much wider\ncanvas than there is time or space\nto do here. But to take an example\nat an almost trivial level, 1 believe\n(but Ido not know for sure) that\nover the years Shell has been\nresponsible for financing the higher\neducation of more students from\ndeveloping countries, indeed of\nmore students overall, than any\nother private organisation in the\nworld. I also agree that inaccurate\nand misleading statements have\nbeen made by some oil-industry\nlobbyists. Sadly the same is true of\ntheir opponents who, all too often,\nalso seem to be unaware of the\npracticalities of running a business.\nFinally your correspondent sees\na conflict in interest between my\nrole as Rector and as a non-executive director of Shell. I see none. I would go further. It seems to me\nthat the aims your correspondent\nseeks to achieve may in fact be\nhelped by having people such as\nme contributing to discussions of\ncompany policy. After all 1 do bring\na fairly good knowledge of higher\neducation and research, have\nworked in climate change, and\nhave devoted around twenty years\nof my life to research into alternative energy sources etc. just a thought!\n\u2022\u2014-HI\nGERMAN SOCKED\nDear Felix,\nDuring my year out in Germany,\nI felt deprived of not having established enough contacts before\ngoing out there, and felt I lacked\nknowledge of German culture. I was then determined to set up an\nAnglo-German Society.\nHowever, when the forms were\nhanded in to the Union, the Union\npeople were confused - they did\nnot know where we belonged! The\nOSC thought we should apply to\nCSC [I think this should be SCC\n(Social Clubs' Committee) - Ed]\nsince our society was not solely for\nGermans. CSC on the other hand\ndid not want us because although\nsocial and cultural integration was\nour theme, our name strongly suggested links with OS C. Three\nmonths were wasted while we\nwere oscillating between these two\ncommittees, which clearly did not\nhave good communication between each other. In the end, we\nwere 'kindly' accepted by OS C under the condition that we had to\nchange our society's name to\nGerman Soc.\nDuring all these unnecessary\nprocesses, we have lost many\nprospective members because\nfirstly, we missed the Freshers' Fair.\nSecondly, the name German Soc\nstrongly suggests that this is a society primarily for Germans (like\nmost overseas societies), so non-Germans are put off.\nConsequently, some native\nGerman speakers are driven away\nbecause they have come to Britain\nto learn about British culture, rather\nthan have a regular 'let's get-homesick' gathering.\nTo be honest, we do not care\nabout the politics going on behind\nthe scene; all we wanted was to\nprovide a place for people who share the same interests to meet\nand gain mutual understanding of\neach other and have some fun at\nthe same time. So, can somebody\ntell me what's in a name? Co zI apparently don't know the answer!\nShin Yi Jeng\nPhysics 4\nRon Oxburgh [Rector]\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for\nlength, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.\nLetters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe\ncard when submitting them.\n\n"

    "content": "12 COLUMNS 13 February 1998\nTHOUGHT FOR THE DAY:\nChoo, choo...\nI went home this weekend, blazing a diagonal\ntrail up the country to my murky Liverpudlian\nabode. It may be an easy target for literary\nattack, but the ordeal has forced me to make\nanother negative comment about one of our\ngreat British traditions; the fantastic and historic\nrailway system.\nPrivatisation of the railways is here to stay;\nwith the government trying to make as much money as is absolutely possible, while craftily\nshifting the responsibility for incompetence onto\nthe likes of Richard Branson. Nice guy though he\nseems, a man who spends so much time in balloons is bound to be responsible for a lot of hot\nair; an assertion which seems to be confirmed\nby his promises to \"raise the standard of the rail-ways...\"\nMy sister told me recently that ol' Blighty\nhas the highest rail fares in the world. Having\npaid one score pounds and ten for a return tick-et, I was immediately given the pleasure of staring at an illuminated sign preaching a sermon\nfrom above along the lines of \"train not ready\".\nThis situation prevailed for half an hour, while\nmy seat-obtaining punctuality advantage slowly\nevaporated, like a cup of cold, un drinkable railway coffee. When we were finally given the privilege of seats, I was forced to sit in the smoking\nsection; it was either that or outside the malfunctioning toilets. Once1 had secured a seat\namongst empty ranks \"Reserved\" by seemingly\nWhy aren't they all painted red by law?\nphantom commuters, God's Mobius warped sense of humour made an appearance by inflicting a terrible plague upon me; hunger.\nLighting, it seems, is now reserved for the\nfirst-class customers, presumably to counter\nallegations of restrictive practices; I made it to\nthe buffet car, after passing through a carriage\nwhere the lights had decided not to work. This\nresulted in much stumbling, buffeting from side\nto side, occasional muttering s of \" O h,I'm sorry.\nI didn't see you there,\" and alleged cases of sexual harassment.. I then had to return to my seat,\nblinded by the bright lights of the buffet, clutching my limp sandwiches and scalding coffee\nwhile trying hard not to walk into any shell-suit-ed Samson-size Scouse sportsmen. And which\nsophist had the idea of affixing a full-length mirror to the wall inside the toilet? Watching myself\nperform a call of nature is not my idea of luxury\ntravel.\nOur one hope is that the money received\nfrom ticket sales might be invested to improve\nthese meagre services. The ultimate irony, how-ever, is that my ticket was not even stamped,\nand will be subsequently used by one of my\nfriends to come and visit me. Hark!

    "content": "SPORT 13 February 1998\nRugby Shenanigans Hockey\nICURFC Iv St BARTS ICURFC II v GREENWICH\nA surge by the Imperial pack\nresulted in a brace of tries before\nthe opposition front row had\narrived at Harlington. A drive from\nthe forwards resulted in pen et ra tion, allowing Lionel to score for\nthe first time. Continued pressure\nfor the remainder of the half\ncaused a climax of tries.\nAfter the half time mass\ndebate, several players slipped in\nand out of the side causing confusion amongst the IC defence. Two\nquick tries left Barts within sniffing\ndistance of victory but IC were\nsoon back on the rampage with\nDavo and Lionel splitting the\nmedics in two with a sleek pincer\nmovement resulting in a try.\nDan Colt's sharp eye spotted\nan unmissable opportunity with a press photographer on the sideline\nto put one over with a charming\nsmile. All in all, a spanking performance. ICURFC I3115 St Barts\nThe day started shit. By the time\nwe wanted to leave, we didn't have a full team or a kit. Then\nLogic, our club captain got the per-tol cap key stuck in the ignition of\nour mini-bus We were very late.\nThey immediately had us under\npressure, their pack was fat and\nheavy. Still, with great speed, our\nforwards set up an overlap for our\nbacks to take good advantage of.\nTom Selter scored and Chris\nDickinson converted. Then they\nbrought on a ringer at prop. Despite pressure on us we man aged two more tries.\nThe second half looked to be\ntough, but Kaisau had scared so\nmany of their players with his\nvicious tackling that their backs\ndidn't even want the ball.\nThey managed one score,\nwhich would have been more had\nit not been for excellent defence.\nThe final whistle blew and a great\nvictory for us was secured.\nICURFC II 17 - 7 Greenwich\nICURFC SEEKS SPONSORSHIP\nThis year has seen great changes to\nImperial's Rugby Clubs; RS M have\nreturned to the first team, a professional coach has been signed to\ntrain the team every week and now the clubs' latest venture is to find\nsponsorship.\nWith the arrival of professional\nrugby, ICURFC is having to take\nsteps to remain competitive with\nother clubs and unfortunately these\nsteps require extra funding for\ntraining and equipment. The club is\nalso looking for extra funding to\nsupport a three week tour to South\nAfrica this June. There exists only\nlimited subsidy from within college.\nThe first stepped is to\napproach companies with an interest in IC. By sponsoring one of the\nlargest clubs in college, firms have\na unique opportunity to raise their\nprofile and promote themselves\naround the campus. Advertising is\nnot limited to IC though. The\nKensington & Chelsea Gazette and\nRugby World magazine have also\nshown interest.\nContact m.ay re@ ic.ac.uk or\na. gil der@ ic.ac.uk.\nFirearm Fun\nOn Saturday, the Rifle and Pistol\nClub shot its first shoulder to shoulder match of the small bore season.\nIt was the first time for half the\nteam, so it was with some trepidation that we awaited the arrival of\nthe Oxford team, one of the top\nthree teams in the country. They\ncame late, having stopped off to\nshoot some paupers on the way.\nEventually we heard the distant\nchant of \"Rah rah rah, we're going to\nsmash the oi ks!\" that heralded their\narrival. Thus began the shooting.\nWhilst the unfamiliar pressure\nof match shooting meant that most\nscores were lower than usual, we did well, losing narrowly by I124( out of 1200) to 1 139. Top score\nfor IC was from ' Mad' Mike Eustace. To lose by such a small\nmargin to strong opposition in our\nfirst match does us credit and suitably emboldened we are ready\napproach our future matches with\nrelish.\nICUWHC v UMDS\nWe are great! We won and we played like donkeys, but we are\nlovely birds!\nBagpuss scored an intentional\ngoal that curved around the goal\nkeeper and in. Saboteur missed\n4 5 2 . 5 potential goals but lived up\nto her name and injured two IC\nplayers with her golf shots. Our\nwonderful captain, Snot Face, led\nfrom the front with some stunning\nplay however was goat-like in the\n' D'. Miss Miss kept everything in\ncontrol at the back and yelled\n'Dildo' all the time.\nP.S. We won101 last week.\nWe are special!!!\nICUWHC 1 1 - 0 UMDS.\nICUHC II v PORTSMOUTH II\nThe game got off to a bright start\nwith plenty of IC pressure and we were unlucky at least once if not\ntwice. The game then moved into a fast flowing end to end game With\nsix minutes to go in the first half,\nPortsmouth scored a breakthrough goal. Shocked by this 1C Results\nHockey\nICU HC II 0 -ICU WH CI14 Portsmouth\n0 UMD S Football\n1C UFC101 QM WI( Big scrap)\nICUFC II 1 - 2 Chester Sports\nCollege II (extra time)\nICUFC III 0 - 1 Leeds metro III\nICUFC IV 1 - 0 Royal Holloway\nICUFC VI 3 - 1 St George's III\n(Chirag had a fight)\nRugby\nICURFC II 1 7 - 7 Greenwich\nICURFC III 10 - 13 Portsmouth\nFencing\nICUFC 23 4 Northumbria\nwent into auto-destruct and let in\ntwo more quick goals.\nIn the second half, 1C were put\nunder pressure. We held out and\nthe game drifted into a swapping\nof attacks until Portsmouth scored\nagain.\nDespite the result, IC 2nds acquitted themselves well and can\nhold their heads up high\nICUHC II 4 - 0 Portsmouth II\nThe Grim Sweeper\nICUFC II v CHESTER ICUFC IV v RHUL\nChester were the opponents for\nthe seconds in the second round\nof the BUSA cup. We knew the first\nwas going to be tough, and it was.\nThe second half continued in\nthe same vein but with IC losing a little ground through inferior fit-ness. But Rob had another storming game at the back and saved us\ntime and again. The first half of\nextra time came and went with\nboth teams giving it their all. With\nseven minutes to go Chester went\nahead. With 120 seconds left on\nthe clock, IC equalise d with a superb Pistol Pete header. With 60\nseconds on the clock, however,\nChester went back in front and it\nwas all over. The best run for an IC\nfootball team in the BUSA cup in\nliving memory was over, but even\nso it was a magnificent performance by the boys in black and\nred. Hurrah!\nICUAFC 1 - 2 Chester\nHaving already lost to RH UL IV\ntwice this season, omens didn't look good, especially since\nHolloway said that they considered us as a 'bye' into the next\nround.\nBut our unmatched spirit, generated from years of camaraderie,\nshone through to such an extent\nthat the Fourths managed to dominate the game from the kick-off.\nLacking key players served to\nmotivate our players further,\nFrom the kick-off Chris took a shot and despite dribbling out for a throw-in it signalled our intent for\nthe rest of the game. 1 thought that\nperhaps it wasn't to be our day,\nbut the all important goal was created by Darren and calmly finished\nby Chris. The expected a Holloway\nonslaught never materialise d and\nImperial Fourths never lost con-cent ration. We fully deserved our\nvictory.\nICUAFC IV 1 0 RHUL IV\n\n"

Eight candidates have\nstood for the four positions, and to\nhelp you decide which to vote for,\neach have written their manifestos\n(below). You can also see them perform live at the hustings (6pm Monday 16 Feb in dBs, 6pm Tuesday\n17 Feb in the Reynolds Building,\nCharing Cross campus and 6pm Wednesday 18 Feb in Glady's bar, St\nMary's campus).\nVoting takes place 1 Oam - 5pm Monday 23 and Tuesday 14 Feb in all\ndepartments. VOTE!\nDave Hellard President\nDave Hellard: the Man, the Myth, the\nLegend\nThe question every voter should\nask as they step towards the ballot\nbox is who is David Hellard and why I should vote for him? I know I have. I am not the traditional Union 'stiff\nand I think that worries some people,\nthe fact that I'm not just a Union official who finds himself with no-where\nhigher to go, no more power to get\nother than to run for President.\nSo why am 1 different? Simply, I work in the Union, I live in the Union\nand I live for the Union. I have spent\nmy time in and around the Union and\nunlike many previous contenders,\nmerely CV seeking point pimps, 1 see\nproblems, I see issues and it's time\nsomeone stood for the right reasons,\nto make a change.\nNext year students will be coming to University with less money than\never before. The Union in turn will be\nrelied upon even more heavily. The\nmoney it provides through jobs and\nfunding, combined with the easy\naccess to cheap living could be the\ndifference between the students\nbeing able to afford to come to\nImperial or not. The added pressure\nof money on students will also see a need for our counselling services to\nbe even wider reaching.\nThis is why I must be president,\nto maintain the high standards\nalready set by the Union and to\nassure that the changes that need to\nbe made will be made.\nI work in the Union, I live in the\nUnion and I live for the Union. It's time for the students to make their\nmark.\nJon Lambert President\nFor nearly four years 1 have enjoyed\nbeing a part of ICU at various levels -through being involved with clubs,\nusing the bars and catering, as an\nemployee and more recently sitting\non ICU Council - last year as Chair of\nthe Community Action Group and\ncurrently as Council Chair. I now have\nthe opportunity to do more for ICU\nand all of its members.\nFacilities\nOctober will see a significant increase\nin the number of Students on the\nSouth Kensington campus. This will\nbring increased demands on facilities:\n\u2022 Beit Quad redevelopment - These\nplans need to be implemented as\nquickly as possible in order to provide\nsufficient facilities for the increasing\nnumber of students who wish to use\nthem.\n\u2022 The current trend within college to\nreduce the amount of social space\nprovided in departments must be\nhalted and, where possible, reversed.\n\u2022 Throughout this change, it should\nnever be forgotten that Imperial is\nnow a multi-campus university. I will\nfight to ensure that facilities at the\noutlying campuses do not suffer.\nRepresentation\n\u2022 Dep. Reps. - the current system\ndoes not always work and needs to\nbe re-examined.\n\u2022 Awareness - effective communication is required if ICU is to truly represent its members.\nAccommodation\n\u2022 It is important to ensure that the\ndebacle at the beginning of the year\ndoes not recur. Students have the\nright to expect a certain level of service from the Accommodation Office.\n\u2022 A vetting system for Landlords\nshould be encouraged.\nI am not going to promise things that\nI know I cannot achieve, but I can\npromise that if you elect me for ICU\nPresident, you will be electing someone who has the experience, enthusiasm and determination to lead your\nUnion effectively through this period\nof change.\nSimon Cooper Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)\nAs an MSc student, I 've had much\ntime in this college to appreciate the\nvariety of clubs and societies within\nthe college, and I think I 've got a lot\nout of them. So essentially the major\nreason behind my candidacy is to\nallow me the chance to see them\nimprove even further.\nNext year, as ever, we shall be\nfaced with further integration: the\nopening of the BMS building to new\nstudents will bring a whole load more\nstudents onto the campus, where\nthey will be much better placed to\ntake advantage of the facilities here.\nThese facilities will need to be\nimproved to cope, but not at the\nexpense of those currently off the\ncampus. Biology's move from the\nquad will also have major implications\nfor the union - plenty of expansion\npotential, meaning new rooms,\npotentially for clubs needing them,\nand more space for college nightlife.\nI come from a varied background\nwithin the college, encompassing\nsome CCU involvement in the distant\npast, occasional rugby playing, the\nodd cultural society and a hefty\ninvolvement running various recreational clubs, primarily the canoe club.\nWith this experience I feel I have a useful working knowledge with which\nto begin, and 1 learn quickly too.\nI intend to put my commitment\nand effort into improving all our clubs,\nnot just those based on the campus,\nand ensuring the facilities, such as the\nsports grounds, the resource centre\nand store spaces are continually\nmaintained at an adequate level.\nThat's all folks, vote for me.\n\n"

The intention of the\ndesign is to increase the total\ncapacity of the Union facility, to\naccommodate the new medical\nstudents, and to turn dBs into a stand-alone facility, with its own food outlets, bar and increased\nstage area.

As Imperial's campuses continue to merge, I feel it is increasingly\nimportant that students from all parts\nof the college contribute to the news-paper. To this end Felix will have a representative at each of the main\ncampuses, who would be in regular\ncontact for news and information.\nFelix is a newspaper, not a magazine,\nand its primary concern should be\nissues relevant to students. However,\nFelix should also entertain the reader-ship: The diverse features and review\nsections will stay, but I feel the layout\nneeds clarification to make them\nmore accessible.\nI want to improve the quality of\nwriting throughout Felix, specifically\nthe reviews and sports pages; articles\ncan be well written whilst retaining\ntheir wit and entertainment value.\nFelix is and will remain independent,\nand I will protect its editorial freedom\nfrom external influences. It will not\ntake any particular political stance,\nbut will reflect the opinions of all students at the college.\nFor Felix to maintain and improve\nupon its current high standards, it is\nvital that it has someone committed\nand organised in the position of edi-tor. Last year I successfully co-edited\nPhoenix, Imperial's arts magazine, as\nwell as running my own society with\nits own column in Felix. As News\nEditor, 1 am very familiar with how\nFelix is run, both technically and\nadministratively. I am committed and\norganised, and with your support I can ensure that Felix remains an informative, entertaining and excellent\npublication.\nAlok Jha Felix Editor\nFresh\nFelix is always in need of a constant\nstream of fresh ideas. This means\nthat it is important for people at college to get involved if their ideas and\nviews are to be expressed. I intend to\nmake Felix much more accessible to\neveryone who wants to contribute. I want to also include a regular new\nsection where clubs and societies can\ntell us either about their events or just\nwhat they do.\nImaginative\nAny publication lives or dies by the\nquality of its articles. I intend to make\nsure that next year the features and\ncolumns in Felix are not only innovative and interesting but also relevant\nto students here at Imperial College.\nDiverse\nThe most important part of Felix is its\ncontent, it is important to have current and accurate news to inform\nreaders of events not only at College\nbut also all the issues relating to students in London. To create a truly\ndiverse Felix, however, it is important\nto have a reviews section that is\nentertaining and informative as well\nas a sports section that is inclusive\nand up to date.\nRestyled\nFor a long time, Felix has been an\nunhappy compromise between a magazine and a newspaper. I intend\nto make next year's issue into a mag-a zine. This opens up a whole new\nrange of possibilities for the design\nand layout and, I guarantee, will result\nin the best looking Felix ever!\n1 care enough about the future of Felix\nnot to just let it become a 'rag' that\npeople pick up on a Friday morning -I want to give it a breath of fresh air.\nIf you want a Felix you can be proud\nof next year, make sure you vote for\nme.\nICU \u2022i eb is wee i; Keep T^^p Pr^^^^ i~*t vel come Tollraievo-Wcd IK1\n'1\nFe~\nas Boot: iJ fl B tor'i CWI-SMB 22'WK>\n\u2022 Mk i2.

    "content": "18 MUSIC 13 February 1998\nSINGLES j The Hybirds - See me through\n' \" HB Alright tune, sounding a bit repetitive but\nthe guitar drives the song on. Lilys - A nanny in Manhatten\nThis is the new Levis theme which lacks the\ncolour and energy seen in the ad. It's a bit too\np hunk y for me!\nDandywarhols - Every day should be a holiday\nHeard these guys on the radio a few times and\nthey seem to be getting OK reviews. But to me\nit sounds like an express train going nowhere\nfast.\nSimon Warner - The wrong girl\nUmm, the song starts off well but then the\nrespectability of it declines steeply when he\nstarts singing. Better leave this one alone!\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON1 Hinda Hicks - If you want me\nThis is Hinda Hick's debut single of '98 and is da\nlicks. She delivers ap hunk y flavoured track with\nthe sample Too Hot from Kool and the Gang.\nShe is going to blast on to the R'n B scene with\nthis tune. Lets hope she makes it big in '98, she\ndefinitely got the features-no doubt!!\nShelter - Whole wide world\nThis is an American alternative indie group with\nsome Hindu influences, Hare Krishna! Song\nsounds better as you listen to it.\nStereophonies - Local boy in the photograph\nQuite a good kick in' tune from the 'Phonics with\nsome blasting drum beats. Seems like this is\ngoing to be a popular one.\nAddict - Red Bird\nThis is a slow tempo indie track which we've all\nheard before. It grows on you after a few listens\nbut still is a little downbeat.\nStrangelove - Another night in\nStrangelove, strange boys, delivering a catchy\nyet annoying tune singing some really interesting lyrics about having 'another night in'. It'sO K. Save Ferris - World is new\nHow can 1 sum up this tune. It contains some\nreally corny crap trumpet work but gets a bit\nbetter when it stops. This new band have had\nlimited success in the U.S. and I can't see why?\nLets hope they do better here, yeah mate!\nMellowbac - Illusion\nThis is a slick mellow tune from a rap group\nbased in Germany. It consists of two laid back\nrappers spin n in' their web of wicked words\nbacked up by some smooth female vocals. It\ncontains some French rap verses sounding similar to Alliance Ethnik with their groovy sounds.\nInteresting to see how they do in '98, they definitely got the skill z! Deni Hines - Delicious\nRadio edit has ap hunk y laid back flavour with\nsome groovy piano and guitar back in' it up.\nThere is also aC Swing remix featuring Don-E which does nothing for the track and also an\nupbeat Cold mix which houses up the track for\nthe worst.\nFinley Quaye - Your love gets sweeter\nThis is a more up tempo track from Finley who sings about the joys of a woman! It is not quite\nas good as what he has come out with before\nbut it is still a catchy little tune and sure of success. Chantal Kreviazuk - God made me\nShe is a23 year old Canadian pianist, singer,\nsongwriter with an Allanis Morrisette flavour but\nstill quite individualistic. She has a soft yet powerful voice and most of her tracks are heartfelt\nand moving! One to watch out for. Oh h hh, Chantal!\nNim\nPrimal Scream - If They Move Kill 'Em\nThis is a groove laden track, with an excellent\nbass heavy under-current. It is one of the number of top class tracks off their most recent long\nplayer, Vanishing Point. It's only going to be\nreleased for a week, so give it a listen, it's worth\nit just to catch a listen of the 'Scream's cover of\nDarklands by those ancient indie maestros, The\njesus And Mary Chain.\nSix By Seven - 88-92-96\nUnfortunately this is depressing and boring,\nmuch in the similar vein as Portishead, with the\nexception of extremely whiny vocals. Apparently\nthis band has been touted as one of the breakers for '98, all 1 can say is don't believe the\nhype.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON2 Cornershop - Brimful Of Asha\nIf you've been listening to the radio recently you\nare bound to have heard this beautiful slice of\npop by the previously (nearly) unheard of\nCornershop. This is an ode to famous Hindi\nsingers (Asha and others) and much loved vinyl\n45s. It is essential to investigate the remixes on\nthe rest of the single, they're on another level\nfrom the original single edit.\nPitchshifter - Genius\nThis is described as a fusion of metal and tech-no, although it is more similar to a pathetic\nattempt at trying to gain some commercial\nground by introducing a dance y beat to some\npoor metal RAW W K. Crandaddy - Everything Beautiful Is Far Away\nLo-fi-ness at its worst, it is bland, and uninteresting. It is advisable to avoid this record with a passion.\nJason\nTH A BOMB) Yeah, Yeah it's that time again Felix,\nFriday its must be the Tha Bomb. Sit back\nrelax and just read you know where it's at!\nComing up you got all the usual shit.... news,\nsingles, you know all that, but y 'all also got\nsome extra stuff and its all free of charge.\nNow for some news, the ooo ohs and the\naaaa ahs of the RnB world. I heard this story\nfrom one of my boys on Saturday, I don't know whether its true, but who cares about\nthe truth; Lil Kim and Foxy Brown are both\ntouring with the Puff Daddy crew over stateside and if my boy is right they got a little\npissed off with each other and it all ended in\nnails at 10 paces (every bad boy's perfect\nnight, two bad girls fighting it out in the\nmud...ooo ooh). Oh and by the way for those\nwho bought tickets for the Puffy gig in January\nit seems that the Puff Daddy was too ill to\ncome over here, but good enough to go over\nto the other coast and see Michael Jackson\nlast month. Rumours of a Jacko-Puffy collaboration started late last year, well they may\nnot just be rumours anymore. Jacko's kid sister has added an extra date to her tour in\nJune...my question is why?, the last album\nwas so fucked up I can't imagine anyone\ngoing to see the tour, only reason I can think\nto go is if she plays loads of old tunes.\nOn the album front the wicked Jay-Z album, In My Lifetime Vol. I, has just been re-released, the record company probably looking to generate more sales on the interest\ncreated by Wishing On A Star, you know this\nis gonna be a huge crossover hit...the British\npublic love the old remade classics. Just\nswitching to a Drum'n 'Bass groove for a sec-on d, the new Goldie album is at long last\ngonna get a release, titled Saturnz Return,\nthis double album includes the dope tune\nDigital with KRS1. The Ride, a film that will\nprobably never make it to our big screens has\na soundtrack that's already out and is in the\nprocess of blowing up on the underground.\nI 've only heard a couple of the tracks but I 've\ngot to say they were phat ness itself and if the\nrest of the album lives up to the hype surrounding it then we got some major shit on\nour hands. The Weekend is a wicked party\ntune and The Worst from Onyx and The Wu\nblows your mine....I don't wanna say anymore\ncause u got a review coming up next week.\nTo finish off I gotta mention a little story\nI heard last week apparently while a friend of mine was now in IC radio he heard\nsomebody saying that while 1 start off writing\nlike some sort of rude boy my writing style\nslowly gets more and more normal towards\nthe end. Now I read thru' last weeks column\nand look at that it's probably true, but\nthat doesn't worry me. ..u worry me for reading my column and analysing the fucking\nthing. This little story encases all the shit that\ngoes with Imperial rather than props for the\nwriting the fucking thing 1 get shit because my\nstyle isn't consistent.\nShoutouts to the Chem. Eng. home girls,\nyou know who you are! I'm out.\nMilen\n\n"

    "content": "3 February 1998 NEWS\nArab Soc Fight\nTONY OFORI\nThree groups of security guards\nwere called to restrain an angry\ncrowd as a large scale fight broke\nout in the Sherfield building after an\naltercation over a mobile phone.\nThe incident happened two weeks\nago in the early hours of Saturday\nmorning. Following an Arabian\nSociety function, two students\nbegan arguing over the possession\nof the phone, and this escalated\nwhen friends joined in. Punches\nwere thrown before college security and Union stewards intervened\nto diffuse the situation. Clubsec, a security firm contracted by the\nUnion, were also brought in and the parties involved were led off\ncampus in opposite directions.\nHowever, the dispute did not\nend here. With emotions running\nhigh the two groups met again in\nExhibition Road where fighting\nonce more broke out. The violence\nwas such that the police we te called in, but the group soon dispersed and no arrests were made.\nCollege security passed on what\nthey knew to the police, but due to\nthe quick exit of the two sides not\nmuch information could be ga th ered. It is suspected that gang warfare could have played a part in the\nconfrontation, but the Arabian\nSociety's president Mar wa Hamour\ninsists that \"the incident has been\nblown out of proportion\". The\npolice are reluctant to comment\nbecause the incident is currently\nunder investigation.\nEcstasy Guru Dies\nJEREMY THOMSON\nNicholas Saunders, counter-culture\nwriter and alternative businessman,\ndied in a car crash last week aged\nsixty. Failing to complete his\ndegree, the former IC student\nworked initially as an inventor, producing one of the first working\nanswering machines. In the mid1960 s he became involved in the\n'psychedelic revolution', experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs\nwhile living in a Squat in Fulham.\nHe then moved into writing, producing the highly popular\n'Alternative London' series.\nMeeting with considerable success, he raised enough money to\nbuy derelict property and founded\nNeal's Yard in Covent Garden, home to alternative shops, restaurants and publishers. A firm believer in maximum information, he is\nwell known as an impartial expert\non modern drugs, writing the popular E for Ecstasy, Ecstacy and the\nDance Culture [Felix 1042] and Ecstasy Reconsidered [Felix 1097],\nFor more information, see the website www.obsolete.com/ecstasy.\nElection Update\nNEWS TEAM\nToday brings to an end the first\nweek of campaigning in the\nSabbatical Elections. There are two candidates running for each pos i tion; Alok Jha and Ed Sexton for\nFelix Editor, Adam Cherrington and Simon Cooper for Deputy President (Clubs and Societies),\nJames Carter and Dave Wharton for\nDeputy President (Finances and Services), and Dave Hellard and Jon Lambert for ICU President.

John\nPrescott has learned to speak fluent eco-jargon, but despite making\nall the right noises, even the simplest and cheapest policies have\nstill not been implemented.\nThe biggest problem with air\npollution is its invisibility; it can\nrarely be seen, the body quickly\nadjusts to the background stench\nand it generates no serious public\ninterest. People have developed a gung-ho attitude of total acceptance of the pollution. They stride\nthrough smoggy streets with their\nnose held high as if it was some\nsort of challenge, rather like\nVictorian alp in is ts who, frostbitten\nand dying, still greeted others with\na hearty \" Good Day\" rather than\nasking for help.\nEveryone knows what happens\nto the occupants if the exhaust\nfumes are fed back inside a car, but\nfail to realise the similarity between\nthis and the environment by a busy\nstreet. The fact is that air pollution\ndamages the health of everyone in\ncities, some times seriously, and\nsometimes fatally. To paraphrase\nDylan, how many cars must a man\ndrive around before he dies of lung\ncancer?\nBEHIND THE\nTIMES\n1 recently bought a copy of the new\nImperial College Calendar. This is\nessentially a college handbook\ncontaining facts and figures about\nall departments and services, and\nalthough Iam still none the wiser\nwhy it is called a calendar, it is\nlargely clear and accurate. 1 was,\nhowever, rather surprised to find\nthe following paragraph in the\nAdmission section:\n\"Woman Students\nApplications for women students are encouraged. Several\nhalls of residence and student\nhouses have places for women students.\"\nSmall Ads\nFeynman For Sale\nFeynman's Lectures on Physics\ntextbooks.
