In theory this should\nmake Christmas shopping cheaper and\nmake us all want to spend more and\nwhen we spend more it\u2019s good for the\neconomy. Economic theory calls this a\n\u201cstimulus package\u201d \u2013 i.e. a set of government actions that are designed to\nstimulate the economy. In real life we\ncall this a \u201cmistake\u201d or \u201cfail maneuver\u201d\nbecause whilst the stimulus package is\na good idea in theory, it doesn\u2019t work\nso well in real life. Here\u2019s why:\n1\nThe 2.5% cut isn\u2019t really\n2.5%.\nIt\u2019s actually more like 2.1%\nwhen you think about it. It\u2019s\nbecause a 2.5% cut in VAT\nisn\u2019t a 2.5% cut in the price of the whole\nthing. I know that may sound funny so\nhere\u2019s how it works.\nVAT or Value Added Tax is a tax on\ntransactions taking place, meaning that\nthe tax kicks in during the buying and\nselling of a product. So if something\ncosts \u00a3100, you end up paying \u00a3117.50\n(from \u00a3100 x 1.175) because the tax sits\non top of the price. Now at this point\nyou might be wondering about all the\nstuff you bought for \u00a3100. A common\nmisconception is that if you have to\npay \u00a3100 for something, then \u00a317.50\nof that \u00a3100 is VAT, but that\u2019s not true.\nIf you have to pay \u00a3100 for something\nthen the actual price is \u00a385.10 and the\nVAT is \u00a314.90. This is because \u00a314.90\nis 17.5% of \u00a385.10.\nSo what happens when VAT goes\nfrom 17.5% to 15%? Well, under the old\nlaw VAT at 17.5% meant that a \u00a3100\nproduct would cost \u00a3117.50 and now it\ncosts \u00a3115.00. The difference, \u00a32.50, is\nreally only 2.1% of the original price.\n2\nShops will steal the cut.\nBack in the day the NUS\n(National Union of Students)\ncampaigned long and hard\nagainst the government to\nreduce the tax on condoms. When the\ngovernment relented and reduced the\ntax rate, the NUS sat back thinking it\nhad won a victory for studentkind and\ncasual shaggers everywhere. But when\nthe government cut the condom tax,\nnothing changed. The condom companies simply absorbed the tax cut into\ntheir profit margins and students everywhere carried on as usual.\nThis time around with the new tax\ncut, things will probably be the same.\nBecause products are usually listed\nwith VAT included, it would be very\neasy for shopkeepers to just take the\nextra 2.1% for themselves. In fact, it\nwould cost them extra to change all the\nlabels in their shops to pass the saving\non to the customer.\nI know that when you went shopping\nlast the shopkeeper reduced the prices,\nbut not all shops are going to. Something that cost \u00a31 a month ago is still\nprobably going to cost the same today.\nThere are millions of transactions for\nsmall amounts every day, and they\u2019re\nall unaffected.\n3\n2.1% ain\u2019t that much.\nHave you ever ordered\nsomething from China? It\ntakes ages to get here. And\nI mean AGES. That\u2019s why all\nthe shops and large retailers ordered\ntheir products for Christmas months\nago, before they realised how bad the\nrecession would be.\nThe resulting oversupply is nothing\nnew, usually after Christmas you have\nthe January sales, where all the shops\ntry and sell of whatever leftover Christmas stuff they can. But because of the\nmassive oversupply this year there\u2019s\nno way the shops could clear all the\nleftover sock in January, which has led\nto some of the biggest Christmas sales\nwe\u2019ve seen for years. Compared to the\nreductions that the stores are offering,\nthe 2.1% cut is pretty paltry. In fact, a\nlot of people only notice the cut when\nthey\u2019re at the till, suggesting that the\nprice cut didn\u2019t even happen to come\ninto the buying decision.\n4\nWe\u2019re all saving for later.\nWe all know that the tax\ncut will have to be paid for in\nthe future using higher taxes.\nSo even though we\u2019re saving\na little at the till we\u2019re going to be hit\nsomewhere else. It\u2019s likely (because we\nhave a left leaning government) that\nthe people who\u2019ll be affected most of\nthe future tax burden will be the richer\nmiddle and upper class. But the problem is that these are exactly the kind of\npeople that the government wants to\npromote into spending. It\u2019s the richer\nclass who buy stuff they don\u2019t need,\nand it\u2019s that over consumption that\nour \u201cshop keeper\u201d economy thrives on.\nTelling these groups that they\u2019re going to face higher taxes will just provoke them into spending less on useless junk \u2013 the exact opposite idea to\nChristmas.\nSo what\u2019s the alternative? Well, David\nCameron has been smugly trying to\npaint the government plans as disastrous without suggesting any realistic alternatives and although his logic\nseems to be seductive, it\u2019s important to\nignore what he says. While he is a very\nskilled politician, his arguments in favour of slashing government spending\nare pretty silly. This recession is a classic stagflation case and if history has\nshown us anything, it\u2019s that active government is the best way through.\nOn the supply side of the economy,\nfood, oil, steel and credit became\nmore expensive. This rose the costs of\ncompanies, which rose prices, which\nscrewed things up. In the wake of the\nnews of the recession and a decreased\ndemand, steel and oil have dropped\ndramatically in price. The government\nstepped in to make credit more available and eventually it should ease the\nproblem. The only remaining problem\nis food, which the government can\u2019t\ntackle quickly anyway.\nOn the demand side there is a lack of\nconfidence in the economy. That lack\nof confidence is cutting back private\nexpenditure. Without that expendi-ture, the economy has less to produce\nwhich leads to job losses, which leads\nto even less confidence. So in this\ncase the government is stepping in to\nbuy up more. By adding to consumption (in classic Keynesian fashion)\nit\u2019s plugging up part of the gap left\nby people not spending. While the\ngovernment couldn\u2019t possibly save\nthe economy on it\u2019s own, it\u2019s better\nthat they do what they can rather\nthan nothing.\nAnd it works double\nbecause government\nexpenditure (by the\nvery nature of what\nthey spend on) generally helps people. It\nwould be insane to cut\nback on hospitals and\nschools and police when\nthe economy is in the pan.\nRight now people are most\nat risk and we need a large\ngovernment looking out for\nthem. It will sound contradictory but now the economy is shrinking, it\u2019s the\nright time to grow the\npublic sector.\nThe big problem is\nthat to fund the extra\nspending the government has to put itself\nin debt, and debt is bad. So it\u2019s\nimportant that the government shrinks\nafter the recession ends and pays back\nwhat it owes (because if the government fails to keep the public balances\nin order, it\u2019ll cause a recession). One\nof the biggest mistakes made by public leaders across the world is not cutting back public expense during high\ngrowth years. Blair and Brown certainly made that mistake and it pretty\nmuch destroyed the public finances.\nSo. Will the VAT cut help? Probably\nnot. But will the overall idea of government borrowing help the economy?\nYes, provided we pay it all back. And\nthat\u2019s the problem.\nS\no there\u2019s a recession on. The\nsky\u2019s falling, people are panicking and the world\u2019s going to end and stuff. But it\u2019s\nnot all doom and gloom you\nknow. There are good things to reces-sions, namely stuff gets cheaper.\nRight now house prices are crashing,\nand all the property people are very,\nvery upset \u2013 or are they? Property is a\nlong term game where you have to plan\nfor years and years ahead.\nFor example, the Imperial College\nproperty managers consider property\ninvestment over a 100-year term. That\nmeans that the college looks 100 years\nahead when considering whether to\nbuy or sell sites. Seriously. Over the\nsummer there was concern that the\ncollege was going to sell a certain piece\nof land off to a private investor. The\nland in question would be a prime development spot, but legislation means\nthat it can\u2019t be built on for the next 50\nyears or so. Any private landholder\nwould have sold the site in the blink of\nan eye but because the college has such\na long term view on the world, it kept\nthe site and in 50 years don\u2019t be surprised if Imperial gets a new building\nin South Ken.\nOld dogs in the building game will\npoint out to us youngsters that more\nbuildings are built during recessions\nthan during periods of growth. Sound\nsilly? It\u2019s because big projects start getting planned during the good times,\nbut by the time that the actual constructing happens, the economy has\nturned.\nRight now most property development firms are posting losses, with\nsmaller firms going out of business\nin droves. But the larger more stable\nfirms aren\u2019t too worried.\nIn fact, a lot of them are laughing\nnow. The best time to buy property is\nwhen a recession is at it\u2019s worst. And\nnow that property prices are falling\nthere are a lot of big players out there\nwaiting to buy up everything they can.\nDon\u2019t be surprised to see Chinese\ncompanies buying up huge chunks of\nAmerican cities, or private investors\ngobbling up troubled companies because right now, the recession sale is\non.\nBuy when the streets run red with blood\nThe recession isn\u2019t a bad thing for everybody, especially for some of the people who are worst affected\nAnd since the government is pushing hard to get credit into the markets\nagain, interest rates from government\nbacked banks will be nice and low in\nthe mid-future, making the whole exercise much, much easier.\nIn six months time, developers will\nbe able to buy up cheap property with\nrelatively cheap money and by the time\nthey\u2019ve built their investments up, the\nmarkets will have recovered \u2013 driving\nup prices.\nSo as soon as you get out of univer-sity, buy a house. Any house in London\nor a nearby suburb. Then get a fixed\nlow interest mortgage from a government backed bank and wait for the\nprices to rise. You won\u2019t regret it.\nBut Brown\u2019s plan will. Here are four reasons why:\n\u201cCameron has\nbeen painting the\ngovernment\u2019s\nplans as bad\nwithout suggesting\nany alternatives\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as you\nleave uni, buy\na house, any\nhouse in London.\nThen wait for\nprices to rise.\nYou won\u2019t regret\nit\u201d\nClubs & Societies Is your club cooler than the cat that\ngot the cream? Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nT\nhe 3rd of December was\nanother successful day for\nthe Teddy Bear Hospital n\nChelsea and Westminster\nHospital in Fullham.\nThe Teddy Bear Hospital is a project\npromoted by Medsin (a network of students interested in health care matters)\nwhich aims to diminish children\u2019s fear\nof hospitals and doctors along with\npromoting healthy living guidelines\nsuch as healthy eating and exercising.\nThe project has been running internationally since 2000 but only reached\nImperial College in 2006. The society who is in charge of TBH is EMSA\n(European Medical Students Association), which has its own branch here at\nImperial.\nThe last TBH organised by our medical students entertained more than 50\nlocal year 2 schoolchildren. What the\nschoolchildren had to do was to bring\ntheir sick teddies along and have the\nmedical students examine and provide\ntreatment for them.\nMedical students from all years had\nthe opportunity to interact with the\nchildren in a stress-less environment\nand therefore exhibited the fun perspective of medicine.\nHow does the Teddy Bear Hospital\nwork? Each child brings his ill teddy,\nas a responsible \u2018parent\u2019, to the hospital where he presents it to the students\nwho get to play the teddy-doctors.\nThis year\u2019s scenario even included an\nambulance setting which was basically\na tent which the teddies in need of urgent medical care were transported to\nvia a trolley!\nThe children further received education on various childhood illnesses\nsuch as chickenpox. And yes, there\nwere teddies with chickenpox (attach a\nfew red circular stickers on and there\nyou go!)\nThe A&E station proved to fulfil the\nchildren\u2019s curiosity about the instruments used by doctors as they got the\nopportunity to play around with the\n\u2018scary\u2019 stuff such as oxygen masks.\nTeddies that had broken bones had to\nof course be taken for an X-ray. At this\nstation, the medical students explained\nto the children what X-rays do stressing the fact that they are painless.\nThe children were encouraged to\ntry and locate organs on a skeleton.\nThroughout the stages the children\nwere actively engaged with the presentation of the medical techniques\nand were eager to use the instruments\nthemselves.\nNext was the plaster station. The\nteddy bears received appropriate treat-Teddy Bears Hospital\nRosie Americanou took her sick teddy bear to report for felix\nment by having bandages applied to\ntheir broken arms and legs. The children were prompted to apply the bandages to the teddies and therefore most\nof them enthusiastically covered their\nteddies in bandages.\nThe surgery station proved to be\nthrilling for most children as a muppet\nsurgeon operated on a critically injured\nteddy. Children got to \u2018scrub in\u2019 as well\nby wearing the appropriate gowns as\nsupplied by the students.\nBefore the children left, they received\ninstructions on healthy living habits.\nThe delivery of the teaching though,\nwas nothing but typical.\nExercising for a healthy body did not\nlimit to the students advising the children but also made use of the medical\nstudents\u2019 dancing skills. They danced\ntogether to the well known Macarena dance routine. Furthermore, the\nhealthy eating station provided fresh\nfruits and smoothies for the children\nwhilst explaining the benefits of a\nhealthy diet.\nThe children enjoyed the experience\nand curiosity and enthusiasm was substituted for the fear of hospitals all too\ncommon among children. Thanks to\ndays like these, who knows: perhaps\nsome of these kids will be qualified\ndoctors in 20 years time!\nHelp us feed the cat\nfelix is one very fat cat and is in constant need of new meat \u2013 please help!\n- a Clubs & Societies editor\n- a Webmaster\n- Features and news writers.\n- Fink U can spell betta than us? Come and help us copy edit.\nIn particular we need:\nA teddy bear with a damaged arm gets bandages to help him recover\nChildren from local schools learn about the joys of healthy eating and exercise, as well as letting the medical students treat their teddy bear\u2019s aches and pains\n\n"

These are aimed at\nnurturing outstanding doctoral candidates as they work and do research\nwith colleagues from a large number of\nfields, cultivating and fostering a spirit\nof intellectual and academic pursuit.\nThis is different to most PhD studentships that are usually focused on research that is not inter-disciplinary.\nThis grant is part of the EPSRC\u2019s\n\u00a3250 million announced by Lord Drayson, the Minister of State for Science\nand Innovation. This will fund not only\nthe Imperial Centres but, another 39 at\nother institutions.\nThe Rector is pleased with the award\nand sees it as a way to further Imperial\u2019s mission to provide \u201cexcellent and\nexciting research training\u201d. Three of\nthese centres are to be run exclusively\nby Imperial College, while another two\nwill be run jointly with the University of\nManchester and Cranfield University,\nThe three Imperial Centres will be\nled by the Department of Physics and\nwill focus on plastic electronic materi-als, materials theory and simulation as\nwell as controlled quantum dynamics.\nThe Plastic Electronics research will\nfocus on developing the superconductors on which the entire electronics industry is based. Professor Jenny\nNelson of the Physics Department\nwelcomes the development as the industry \u201cbadly needs a new injection of\nscientists\u201d. The Centre for theory and\nsimulation of materials will aim help\nscientists and researchers develop the\nskills and tools to understand how materials ranging from individual atoms\nto large-scale structures behave under\ncertain extreme conditions.

Professor Martin Pleno\nsees this as \u201crevolutionary\u201d and a way\nto truly bring the field \u201cinto the 21st\nCentury\u201d.\nThese new centres help bring the\ntotal at the College to six.

And\nthen there\u2019s a tree. It kind of sticks out\na bit\u201d. Josh Yerrell\u2019s strategic racecourse\nanalysis for the Wallingford Head gave\nImperial the upper hand from the off-set. Forty club members raced the 4.8\nkm upstream from Moulsford Railway\nBridge to the Oxford University Boat\nClub. There were eight boats entered\nin total from IC with wins from both\nthe men\u2019s and women\u2019s squads in freezing weather conditions.\nThe top result of the day went to the\nmen\u2019s coxed four of Adam Seward, Richard Winchester, Dan Cadoux-Hudson and Adam Freeman-Posh. Cox\nHenry Fieldman led the crew to a winning time of 17:51.72 in the S24+ event.\nTheir time was not far behind the Elite\n4- winning time. Dom Meyrick-Cole\nrecalls early concern for the crew: \u201cI\nbegan to worry before the race that\nDan \u20182 Crabs\u2019 Cadoux-Hudson wasn\u2019t\ngoing to turn up on time. Eventually\nI found him, trapped under a giant\nthumb\u201d. The sub-human temperatures\nand continuous splash from the race\nhad Cadoux-Hudson in dire straits,\nshivering in a near hypothermic state\nby the end of racing.\nIC also took second place in this\nevent with the crew of Cox Connie\nPidoux, Simon Hislop, Dom MeyrickCole, John Dick and Henry Goodier\ncoming 15 seconds later in a time of\n18:06.44. Photographic evidence later\nrevealed Hislop had raced wearing\npogies (special rowing gloves). This\nsymbol of weakness is highly frowned\nupon by the club and spectators were\nin shock at the two-time Henley win-ner. Seat 2 John Dick was pleased with\nthe race and made his way under Wallingford Bridge to escape the harsh\nweather. Dom Meyrick-Cole at seat 3\nwas unavailable for comment on the\nrace as he was busy looking for Dick.\nThe women\u2019s 4- (Hannah Rouse,\nNicola Smith, Erica Thompson, Christina Matteotti) convincingly won their\nevent (W.S2.4-) ahead of Henley RC\nin a time of 20:54.84. The coxed 4\n(W.S2.4+) of Louise Hart, Ro Smith,\nSelina Graham and Clarice Chung had\nto make do with second place. The\ncrew were going strong having overtaken a vets crew when a boat full of\nschoolboys suddenly stopped ahead.\nIt was too late despite Cox Larissa\nMatley\u2019s calls for easy and a crash was\nunavoidable. Precious time was lost\nbut the crew clawed back securing the\nrunner-up position in 20:54.35.\nAll crews executed new training\nthemes in a racing situation as directed\nby coaching staff. According to Head\nCoach Steve Trapmore, there is \u2018still\nplenty of work to do\u2019. Trappers delivered a passionate pre-race speech demanding crews to \u201crow your bollocks\noff\u201d. A lifestyle change for the women\u2019s\nsquad was suggested to fulfil the brief.\nGillies 4- in the S2.4- event suffered\nan early blow when seat 3 Will Todd,\nstill devastated from Kingston results,\ndiscovered his former partner Ole Tietz was in Sheffield with another man.\nThe continuous pining for Tietz caused\nbuilt-up rage throughout the boat and\neventually Stroke Alex Gillies snapped.\nIn a fit of rage the entire steering shoe\ncame off and the rest of the race was\nspent bouncing from one side of the\nbank to the other.\nNext week is Sculler\u2019s Head from\nChiswick to Putney where George\nWhittaker will be defending his heavyweight title. 20 scullers will be waving the ICBC flag and all support is\nwelcome.\nSimon Douglas\nMonday15thDecember\nSquash\nMen\u2019s 3s ULU vs LSE 3s ULU\nWednesday17thDecember\nHockey\nMen\u2019s 3s ULU vs Imperial College 4s ULU\nRugby\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs Imperial Medicals 2nd\nMen\u2019s 1st vs UWE Hartpury 2nd\nTable Tennis\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Middlesex University 1st\nChristina Duffy\nThis term sees only one competition\nfor the Imperial Dancesport Team\n(that\u2019s Ballroom and Latin \u2013 the dancing you see in Strictly Come Dancing),\nbut it is a big one. Despite there strong\nopposition at the Nottingham com-petition, the team came second place\noverall.\nHowever, that is only part of the\nstory. University Dancesport competitions comprise two parts: the individual competitions during the day,\nfollowed by the team match in the\nevening \u2013 and IC Dancersport\u2019s success ran through both.\nIn the first session, the Intermediate\nBallroom saw an Imperial invasion of\nmassive proportions, with members of\nthe team taking first, second and fourth\nplaces (William Chao & Roser Preuss,\nZheng Ruan & Iwona Pilch and Sherwin Cotta & Yun Wang respectively).\nSuccess continued in the Advanced\nBallroom, with Simon Douglas & Laura Bury taking second place \u2013 beaten\nonly by a couple whose combined age\nis surely in three figures \u2013 Retesh Bajaj\n& Erika Chan making the Novice Ballroom final and the beginners\u2019 team (in-cluding Guo Heng Chin & Jing Jing Yan\nand Jeremy Kalindjian & Katia Bouznik\nmaking the semis) acquitting themselves well against a very large beginners\u2019 turnout from other universities.\nThe Latin section saw slightly more\nmodest success, with beginner couples\nJanson Yi & Yuan Tian and Dex Hong\nand Rachel Demosthenous making\nsemi-finals, Garn Aiewsakun & Fern\nPrapascripan making the Intermediate\nfinal and Simon & Laura and Arman\nSahovic & Nicole Papaioannou both\nmaking the highly competitive Advanced final, finishing sixth and third\nrespectively.\nThe real drama, however, was saved\nfor the team match. In this competi-tion, it is more than five years since\nImperial has finished higher than third\n\u2013 but this year it was a close tussle between Oxford and us for the Title!\nImperial swept the ballroom A and\nB teams, with the successful Intermediate and Advanced couples carrying\ntheir excellent dancing through and\neach winning their dance.\nHowever, we came up against a very\nadept Oxford Latin side, who similarly\nswept the Latin A and B teams, leaving Imperial B team (William & Roser;\nSherwin & Yun; Jack Higgs & Sara Cesarec; Jason Lee & Sarah Ho) tied winners as both Latin couples held onto\nsecond places and the Imperial A desperately close to the same result in the\nFinally, faculty\nsports teams play\na match worth\nparticipating in\nRugby\nRoyal School of Mines XV 15\nCity & Guilds XV 0\nBen Moorhouse\nA team section.\nImperial C team (Max Tay & Soraya\nMerrylees; Leon Ooi & Charlotte\nBeastall; Retesh Bajaj & Ivy Jackson;\nYuen Tian Yi & Yvonne Liu) also came\nsecond with an outstanding performance from Yuen Tian Yi & Yvonne\n(both beginners) who managed an individual second place ahead of much\nmore experienced dancers. The D team\nincluded a strong performance from\nPaul Takla and Alice Wang who made\nan individual final in the ballroom, but\nthe numerous Oxford D teams pushed\nthe very spirited efforts of our beginners out of the team finals.\nThen, on the coach on the way back\nfrom Nottingham\u2019s competition, we\ncelebrated the team\u2019s best results in\nyears in ways that all the single-sex\nsports can only dream of. Roll on next\nterm\u2019s competitions!\nICUWFC continued their run of form\nwith a win against Roehampton two\nWednesdays ago. The team of eleven\nthat day (who needs substitutes?) consisted of Maria and DD upfront, Simran, Yoke, Emma and Ibis in midfield,\nJen, Laura, Cheryl and Steph in de-fence, and finally Genghis in goal.\nAs expected the game began violently with dirty tackles, blatant handballs\nand spastic throw-ins, fouls all committed by Roehampton. But even more\nof a crime was the manner in which the\nreferee refused to acknowledge more\nthan half of their heinous crimes. It was\nfrustrating for the IC team who were\nlooking to play some proper football.\nIC settled into the pace of the game\nquickly enough and it was not long\nbefore DD and Maria were wreaking\nhavoc in the Roehampton penalty box,\nonly being denied by the posts and on\noccasion the Roehampton goalkeeper.\nThe first goal came fifteen minutes\ninto the first half from DD who, from\nGenghis\u2019 goal kick, took the ball around\nthe entire Roehampton defence to create a one-on-one situation with their\ngoalkeeper. The goalkeeper then proceeded to slide in for a tackle with arms\noutstretched and grabbed DD around\nthe ankles to yank her down. Despite\nthe goalkeeper\u2019s best efforts to take DD\nout of the game, DD had managed to\nsqueeze in a shot which rolled into the\nback of the net much to the dismay of\nthe visiting team. Despite IC protests,\nthe referee gave the goal, wagged his\nfinger at the Roehampton keeper and\nwent on his way.\nThe rest of the half continued with\nYoke and Simran pushing down the\nwings giving IC good width, stretching\nthe Roehampton players. Emma, new\nto the central midfield role, looked to\nbe enjoying herself immensely now\nthat she had the chance to push up and\ntake shots. The Roehampton team had\na couple of chances that were mostly\ncreated by the fact that their striker\nblocked out the sun and obstructed\nthe view of the IC defence. While Laura and Cheryl handled the pleasure of\ndealing with said striker and also the\nRoehampton tactician of the century\nwho kept whispering, \u201clet\u2019s run past\nthe defence\u201d to her players, Steph was\nsuffering from inappropriate body\ncontact from an opponent player. The\nfirst half ended with IC in the lead by\none goal.\nThe second half began and IC were\nable to hang onto their lead. Jen and\nSimran abused the left side of the pitch,\nwhich was almost void of Roehampton\nplayers. The second IC goal came not\nlong into the second half from Emma,\nwho rinsed the entire Roehampton\nteam and took a top right corner shot\nfrom the edge of the eighteen yard box,\nmaking it look incredibly easy.\nA few minutes later Roehampton got\ntheir only goal, which was a lucky shot\nthat found its way into the back of the\nnet. IC spent the remaining half of the\ngame defending their lead while the\nRoehampton coach threw a massive\nhissy fit on the sidelines at his players.\nICUWFC sweep past Roehampton ladies\nFootball\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st XI 2\nRoehampton Women\u2019s 1st XI 1\nCheryl See\nLadies football yet again achieve the bare minimum numbers needed\nThe men\u2019s coxed eight from Imperial College Boat Club row in the Wallingford Head of the River\nStrictly Come Dancing eat your heart out!\nA new academic year and thus a new\nneed for the Miners to prove their superiority over the engineers, however\nit became rapidly apparent this was not\ngoing to be as simple as previous years.\nThe omens were coming thick and fast\nas the match approached. A miscom-munication had meant that the team\nwould be using public transport to get\nto Fortress Harlington, the referee had\npulled out injured a day before and the\nRSM Christmas dinner was the night\nbefore the game.\nThe odds were looking increasingly\nagainst the RSM when the opposition\nwere taken into account, with the engineers on paper with the majority of\nthe team being amongst the best that\nIC Rugby has to offer.\nThe players that did turn up were all\nhungover and some key members of\nthe team decided that their beds were\nmore important than playing rugby.\nAfter a lot of moaning and traipsing\nthrough the horrible weather the team\neventually made it to field.\nFrom the kick off RSM were on the\noffence clearly catching C&G completely off guard. They thought it would\nbe a walk in the park playing against a\nbunch of hungover miners, they were\nvery wrong. After the miners initial at-tack, C&G managed to clear the ball\nand started making yards into RSM\nterritory but some absolutely blinding tackling by the team kept the score\nline down to a minimum even though\nthe engineers were inches from the try\nline for at least twenty minutes. Adam\n\u201cthe exfoliator\u201d Foley and Lluis Guasch\nmakde a crucial tackle on the engineers\ncentre Nick \u201cTadpole\u201d Johnstone, to\nprevent the engineers scoring.\nHalf time score: 0-0\nThe second half started with some\ninteresting strategic moves from the\nRoyal Miners that involved taking off\na flanker due to injury and due to the\nteam\u2019s lack of substitutes, taking an engineer into the ranks. This combined\nwith Tim Chalke deciding he would\ntry out playing as flanker, instead of\nthe cold position of wing ensured that\nsomething big would happen this half.\nThe miners were instantly back on\nthe offence again after spending the\nmajority of the previous half defend-ing. After some beautifully flowing\nplay with the forwards making yards\nand off loading to each other, they were\nrewarded with a scrum 5m from the\nengineers\u2019 try line.\nThis was clearly an opportunity not\nto be missed and the team sensed it\nwith an amazing scrum that provided\na good platform for the back line to\ntear into C&G and eventually putting\nAdam Foley flying over the tryline for\nthe first points of the match! Although\nthe conversion was missed it was still\n5-0 to RSM.\nThe floodgates opened for RSM\nwith some continuous flowing play on\nthe offence and even when C&G tried\nto clear the ball, our fullback, fresher\nFraiser James brought it back straight\ninto their territory often knocking\nsome of their players out of the way.\nAfter continued pressure the Miners\nwere within 5m of the tryline when the\nbacks being a bit bored of the standard\ngame decided to mix in a bit of aussie\nrules football into the mix with one of\nthe centres dropping the ball on the\nfloor only for Lluis Gausch to catch\nit on the rebound and clatter over for\nanother try. There was uproar from\nthe C&G boys with them being understandably irate at the ref not seeing\nthe obvious knock on but the try was\ngiven, taking the score to 10-0.\nWith only minutes to go before the\nend of the match, it was starting to\nshow on the RSM front with the pack\ndeciding to have a coughing fit together\nand then Richard \u201cchumbley\u201d Simons\nasking if we could have a 2 minute water break. After this offset the team\ncontinued to play with vigour and this\nresulted in a final try from Adam Foley\nbefore the end of the match to make\nthe final score 15-0.\nOverall it was an absolutely stunning performance made by a team\nthat were all exhausted and hungover\nfrom the last few night\u2019s activities and\nas usual showed that the Miners spirit\nis something hard to beat; a spirit that\nwould be impossible to recreate in a\n\u2018superclub\u2019. The long road to the Bottle\nMatch has begun\u2026\n\n"

You should have been more considerate\nwhen you were taking the money from the\npoor and homeless on the streets of South\nKensington.\nGemini\nClearly touched by\nyour generosity,\nSanta gives you \u00a31\nmillion, but you\nhave to collect it in\nthe middle of the\ndesert. When you get there, you realise that\nyou were given it all in chocolate coins, which\nhas melted. In a fit of rage, you go around and\nkill all the poor people you gave the money to\nand take the money back. You go to hell.\nLeo\nYou blew it and you\nforget that Santa\nknows your name\nMike Squire! Instead\nof giving you the\ngift, he gives it to\nyour mum. Even she thought you were a twat,\nor at least that\u2019s what he thinks, he was behind\nher and there was something in her mouth so\neverything was a little muffled. Santa definitely\nfilled her stockings this Christmas.\nTaurus\nAlthough appalled\nhesee\u2019shopeyetwith\nyour honesty. You\nreceive the chance to\nredeem yourself, but\nwith all of Santa\u2019s\nrambling, you get bored and start taking some\nof the toys for yourself. He catches you. Do you\n1) lie and say you were going to put them in the\nsled or 2) do you tell the truth? If the first go to\nLeo, if the second go to Scorpio.\nAries\nSanta, still not\nconvinced with you\nkindness, makes you\ndecide between the\ntwo. He wants to\nknow what means\nmore to you, the poor or the homeless. If you\nrate raising money for the poor more that\nraising it for the homeless, go to Gemini. If\nyou think that the alternative is better, go to\nVirgo.\nPisces\nSanta looks at the\nlist of things that\nyou\u2019ve done that\nwere apparently so\ngreat. Two things\npop to your mind:\n1)You helped raise money for the poor and\nhomeless. 2) With your Imperial Investment\ngroup you raised \u00a310,000 for club spending. If\nyou think the first is better, go to Aries, if the\nsecond, go to Cancer.\nAnd Santa gave felix some ho-ho-ho-roscopes\nAquarius\nSanta was working\nlate last night\nmaking his list\nbefore checking it\ntwice. He needed\nto find out who\nwas naughty and who was nice, so as to know\nwhat presents to get for the boys and girls at\nImperial. So this is where you help him. If you\nthink you were naughty this year, go to Taurus.\nIf you think you were nice go to Pisces.\nSanta doesn\u2019t exist. I hope I have spoiled it for you.

    "content": "29\nFriday 12 December 2008 felix\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFashion\nFashion Editors \u2013 Dan Wan & Jade Littlewood (Layout)\nWho decides what I wear?\nCaz Knight reasons why the latest trend is actually the latest trend on the high street\nA\nfashion is merely a form\nof ugliness so unbearable\nthat we are compelled to\nalter it every six months.\nAnd wasn\u2019t Oscar Wilde\nright. But fashion is meant to be a\nbeautiful thing. Something that allures\nus, entrances us and helps us achieve\nanything from elevated self-esteem to\nmaking a statement, from making us\nmore attractive to the opposite sex to\ncompeting with the same sex. If fashion were not something attractive and\ntasteful then why would we buy it in\nthe first place and why would there be\na need for such sharp changes at the\nturn of every season? Of course, the\nwhy is a combination of keeping things\nfresh and to avoid the feeling that our\nclothes are stagnating on our backs.\nThe other, more obvious reason, is a\nmoney making one used by the fashion\nhouses and designers - for it is essentially these people who hold the fate of\nour apparel in their hands.\nThe return of plaid shirts to this winter\u2019s fashion landscape is an example of\na recent trend. But who decided it was\nto be a must-have?\nSome designer at\none or another brand\nwould have come up\nwith the idea, made it\na feature of the shop\u2019s\ninventory and a few articles and features in the\nmagazines later, we are\nall grappling for them.\nThis would apply to plaid\nas well as any en vogue\ncolour, style of trouser\nor shirt, shoe, ensemble\netc. Why did designers\nchoose to bring back long\ntops that drown anyone shorter than 5\u20197\u201d, making them look\npregnant at the same time? This question is pretty unanswerable and would\ninvolve traveling to the core of a particular designer\u2019s psyche to find these\nanswers (perhaps he saw some despicable celebrity wearing one at Mahiki.)\nThe point I am trying to make is that a\nseason\u2019s trends are essentially dictated\nDouble-Sided Tights\nThe effin\u2019 definition of SICK. I\nwish even I could wear them\nwithout looking like a ladyboy-tramp. Chanel showcased\nthese in their Fall/Winter 2008\ncollection, and I\u2019m surprised\nthey\u2019re not the big thing right\nnow. Before H&M or Topshop\nget their mass-producing\npaws all over these, snap up a\npair. Two-tone tights are stylish as fuck; YSL 60s style. Add\nthat little special something to\nyour newest outfit. Do it. Now.\nSimon Amstell\nThe Never Mind the Buzzcocks\nhost has been peddling the\nwhole indie-adult look since\nhe took over the show. He\u2019s\na little hit-and-miss. He can\nlook proper sharp in some of\nhis outfits, but 100% horrendous in others. I wonder if he\ndresses himself or a dresser\ndoes? Either way, his comedic\ntiming and nous makes up for\na rather questionable stye.\nMore sick then shit, if you like.\nUgg Boots\nIf you didn\u2019t think Ugg Boots\nlooked atrocious on girls, can\nyou now agree with everyone else that they look plain\nfucking hideous on men. I\ndon\u2019t care if Ben Affleck, Leo\nDi Caprio or Ronnie Wood has\nbeen seen in them. No shape\nand no style. Boys, do not\ninvest. From what I predict/\nhope, this Ugg-wearing phase\nis transient. Eskimos on the\nother hand, you lot are fine.\nSICK\nSHIT\nby the clothing shops, the people who\ndesign clothes for them and the subsequent \u201cfashionistas\u201d who expound on\nthese trends as law in the magazines.\nSo, we have our shops full of attire for\nour choosing and buying. Why do we\njust happen to like what is in the shops?\nA lot of us don\u2019t, such as I. I would love\nto pull off a plaid shirt as I have seen\npeople look gorgeous in them, but it\njust won\u2019t happen. I deplore the style of\ncoats around at the moment - a lot of\nwhich are a relatively good fit around\nthe chest and shoulders and then expand out like a triangle, again, making\nthe wearer look pregnant unless they\nhave a BMI below 10. I am in a position\nto comment on this season\u2019s coats having wasted a great deal of time on the\nhigh street only to find a long, green\ncoat, ten years my senior, in a vintage\nshop at a fraction of the price. And I\nlook amazing in it.\nA fashion then becomes fashionable\nbecause a substantial number of people adhere to it following indoctrination by the brands. Perhaps the small-minded nature of man is brought out in\nus when it comes to fashion as we go along and\ncopy how those around\nus are dressing. Maybe it\nis an inherent instinct to\nfit in and be accepted. I\nhope this is not the case,\nalthough, one would be\nforgiven for doing so as\nit is easy to underestimate the colossal pressure exerted on us\nby society these\ndays, thanks to\nan endless access to media.\nObviously, not\neveryone follows fashion.\nAnd there is not just one\nfashion, there are many tributaries of\nfashion along which to ride on and we\nare at liberty to switch on a daily ba-sis. The clothes I wear are entirely indicative of my mood, how I feel about\nmyself, and what sort of look I want to\nwork, not having found a niche I am\ncompletely comfortable with. I would\nfall more into the fashionista category.\nA rise in vintage shops means we are\nmuch more at liberty to choose our\nown fashion as we have access to those\nfrom yesteryear, as my recent shopping\ntrip demonstrated.\nWhat may be trendy and flattering\non one person could be a disaster for\nanother. Most cuts of top, trouser and\ndress at the present moment are all detrimental for my figure. At only 5\u20194\u201d it is\nsensible for me to wear short skirts and\ndresses to make me look less tiny. I am\nalso more comfortable baring my legs\n(not necessarily out of vanity). However, all the short dresses and skirts are\ndesigned for taller people and so fall to\nmy knees rather than mid thigh. Most\n\u2018normal\u2019 length tops fall well past my\nhips which is something else I hate.\nOne redeeming quality of Topshop is\ntheir \u2018petite\u2019 section which is a dream\ncome true for me as I am able to find\nthose short, tight tops I love.\nSo, why do a lot of us just happen to\nlike what is in fashion and what makes\nus look back on it with hindsight in\ndisgust? The 90s were abhorrent (not\njust in a fashion sense), so why did we\never sport greasy curtains (the men at\nany rate), denim jackets, baggy t-shirts\nwith leggings (of which I am guilty of,\nbut my eight-year-old folly should be\nexcused) and tie-dye? In ten years I am\npretty sure the thought of Ugg boots\nwill be recoiled at; I already do. Don\u2019t\neven get me started on Crocs. Fashion\nis a fickle thing but not as fickle as our\ntastes. Getting to the roots of what exactly it is that makes us like something\nis still an issue under much study by\nanthropologists and neuroscientists\nalike.\nIf we look at what the first cave men\nstarted to wear (fur mainly: I am a\nmassive fan, to hell with the ethics of\nit) up until what \u201ccivilised\u201d man wears,\nwe can look at it as a sort of evolu-tion. What influences this evolution?\nCertainly not survival of the fittest or\nfur coats would be in. Environment,\nthe weather (sort of), culture, popular\nculture influenced by everything from\npolitics, albeit perhaps very tenuously,\nmusic, art and, I am loathe to say it, famous people all play a part.\nAs much as I have disparaged fashion\u2019s fickleness in this piece, there is\nno denying the pleasure of appreciating the wider body of fashion \u2013 that is\nall the clothes, shoes and accessories\navailable to us in the world - just as\nwe might appreciate the craft and skill\nthat has gone into creating a truly glorious sculpture or painting.\nI\nf you think you haven\u2019t heard of\ndesigner Elie Saab, think again.\nIn fact, think back to when\nHalle Berry won her Oscar for\nMonster\u2019s Ball, you know, when\nshe cried like a pansy. She was wearing Elie Saab and was one of the first\ncelebrity endorsements the Lebanese\ndesigner had had at that point.\nThe dress had a completely sheer upper half with floral embroidery covering her breasts and a crimson taffeta\nskirt. Although not one of his best de-signs, it was undeniably controversial\nand raised his profile in Hollywood\nand internationally.\nHis dresses are some of the most\nflamboyant and ornate designs avail-able, though he has been slammed\nfor creating pieces that are over the\ntop; pieces that \u201cwear\u201d the wearer of\nthe garment. This may be down to an\ninherent snobbery in the fashion industry as he is self-taught and spent\nonly one year in Paris studying fashion\nbefore returning in 1982 to open his\nworkshop in Lebanon.\nTo me, his work is synonymous with\nluxury and fantasy and it is definitely\nthe style of the season. Many of his\ndresses are jewel-encrusted and would\nnot look out of place on a fairy atop a\nChristmas tree, and I mean that as a\ncompliment.\nOne of my favourite dresses from\nhis Autumn/Winter 08 collection is a\npurple taffeta-accentuated prom style\ndress. Its volume and colour give impact of theatrical standard!\nThis compares to the 07/08 collection that saw a more whimsical \u2018winter\nwonderland\u2019 and \u2018snow queen\u2019 inspiration come into play. I cannot wait for\nspring!\nWhy I love Elie Saab\u2019s creations\nVictoria Masding enlightens you ignorant fools about fashion\u2019s best-kept secret\nWho decided the lumberjacks were back in right now? Seriously, who?\nPicture\nof\nthe\nWeek\nCroatian\nSunset,\nby\nStephen\nGallagher\nWe\nwant\nto\nexhibit\nyour\nart.\nSend\nin\nyour\nphotographs.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

She says\nthat young female calves acquire the\nbehaviour by copying their mothers:\nit appears as if \u201cthey know this is what\nthey are supposed to do\u201d and think \u201clet\nme go out and do it!\u201d\nOnly a small number of animal species use tools: 30 bird and 10 primate\nspecies and only 0.01% of all other\nmammals. Some scientists believe that\nthis is because most animals lack the\ncognitive abilities to use tools. Others say it is because tool use simply\nis not advantageous to most animals.\nAlthough dolphins have been known\nto sometimes carry conical sponges\n(10-25 cm long) over their jaws, there\nwas no data to explain why they do this\nand whether it provides any advantage to the individuals that do it \u2013 the\nspongers.\nMann and her colleagues observed\na population of wild bottlenose dolphins at Shark Bay in Australia. They\ndescribed in detail the sponge carrying\nbehaviour. They found that spongers\n\u201cswam slowly along sand-bottom habitats with a sponge on, lightly and intermittently disturbing the seafloor\u201d. They\nwere clearly \u201cusing the sponge to ferret\nprey from the sea floor\u201d says Mann.\nThe prey they were after seemed to be\na small burrowing spothead grubfish\n(Parapercips clathrata).\nOnly 11% of the adult female dolphins used sponges to hunt. Nonspongers employed a variety of other\ntactics for hunting, but none of them\nincluded tool use. To investigate if\nspongers were at an advantage, Mann\u2019s\nteam compared the calving success of\nspongers and non-spongers.\nSurprisingly, they found no significant differences in calving success,\nan indication of biological fitness, between spongers and non-spongers. So\nthey could not say that hunting with\ntools is definitely more beneficial to\ndolphins. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything\nabout what the benefits are although\nwe presume that, since the behaviour\npersists, there must be some\u201d, says Alex\nThornton, behavioural ecologist from\nthe University of Cambridge, who was\nMico Tatalovic\nScience Editor\nnot involved in the present study.\nAlex Kacelnik, behavioural ecologist from the University of Oxford,\nwho has extensively studied tool use\nin Caledonian crows, predicts that\nlarger and longer-term investigations\nwill reveal some benefits to the spong-ers. \u201cIt would be a mistake to assume\nthat because this study fails to find a\nreliable difference in fitness between\ntwo groups, then the fitness of the two\ngroups must be equal\u201d, he says, adding\nthat \u201cthis fascinating study is on the\nright track but the fundamental question of whether tool use is particularly\nadvantageous is as yet unanswered\u201d.\nPhoto by Ewa Krzyszczyk\nPhoto\nby\nEwa\nKrzyszczyk\nWhat Happens to Science Graduates in the Times of Credit Crunch...\nGarlic, also good for passing the Breathalysers test, apparently\ntry to pick a wet-one up off the floor?\nIt\u2019s almost impossible.

The idea was simple; the\nMountain mayhem 24 Hours\nDavid Martin\nThe last six months have been busy for\nIC Kendo Club with various events and\nimportant guests. One evening in July\nsaw a group of eight 7th and 8th dan\nsensei, on a visit from Japan, and their\nequally graded hosts at Imperial to run\na training session. This included some\none-on-one coaching and a ji-geiko\nthat devastated even the most hardened participants.\nAlthough Kendo is not an Olympic sport, each country has a national\nteam. With a view to the upcoming\nWorld Kendo Championship in Brazil, on October 25th/26th the Greek\nnational team and their 5th Dan Japanese sensei visited London in order\nto practice and gain experience with\nthe British national squad. Both days,\nmembers of ICKC took part at the\njoint practice that lasted more than six\nhours and helped their teams during\nan unofficial but extremely competitive stand off.\nFollowing a very interesting five\nmember team shiai (match) between\nboth men\u2019s and women\u2019s national\nteams, a three hour normal practice\nled by the 7th Dan GB national coach\nalongside all the visiting higher grade\nsenseis, gave precious advice and encouragement to all the participants.\nFinally, on November 15th, the club\nsent nine competitors (and many vol-unteers) to the Mumeishi 3\u2019s, the largest and most important kendo taikai\n(competition) in Britain. This year,\nthe 35th of this prestigious competi-tion, featured contestants from as far\napart as Tel Aviv, Lithuania, Japan and\nMalta. ICKC had three members in\nthe morning Ladies\u2019 competition that\nall made it to the second round before\nbeing knocked out. Rachel Soon had\nthe misfortune to be drawn against the\neventual winner.\nThe two teams in the afternoon\u2019s\ncompetition were quickly dispatched\nin their first rounds, the A team by a\ntrio of Frenchmen only one of whom\nhad double the years of experience of\nall three members of the Imperial team\ncombined. The quality of some of the\nkendo displayed throughout the day\nwas incredibly high and Imperial acquitted themselves well.\nIC kendo club visited by world class fighters\nteam of that completed the most laps\nin 24 hours would win. Friday night\nwas spent prepping bikes and discussing team tactics around the makeshift\nbarbeque.\nRace day dawned overcast and damp.\nUnlike most teams we spent the morning fuelling up for the race and opted\nout of a quick lap of the course, figuring that we would know where to go in\nthe race itself. The team was divided\nover how best to prepare food wise,\nwith Roger and I adopting the \u2018eat loads\nof jacket potatoes and Jaffa cakes\u2019 ap-proach, and Dave T and James sticking\nto the scientific \u2018consume only energy\ngels\u2019 reasoning.\nAs two o\u2019clock approached, James,\nfull of weird nutrients and electrolytes,\ntook up his place on the start line. The\nrace began with a one-kilometre jog to\nget to your bike, and at 2 o\u2019clock the\nrace began. James delivered a solid\nfirst lap of 1 hour, 8 minutes, but reckoned that the traffic jams leading up\nto the snaking, off camber singletrack\nsections of the course had cost him a\nlot of time. And so the evening wore\non with all of us consistently lapping\naround the 1 hour mark. By the time\nRoger headed out for his 2nd lap, darkness had fallen, and tiny dots of light lit\nup the valley sides as riders made their\nway around the course.\nWe were holding steady around\n250th position overall, sandwiched between Dave and Gay Pride, and keeping pace with Oxford and Cambridge\nin the University class. The Loughborough A and B teams were a long way\nahead at this point, however just after\nmidnight the rain came.\nAt the hand over whilst waiting for\nDave T, riders were talking about parts\nof the course collapsing and turning\ninto rivers of slow moving mud. The\nfact that Dave was taking so long to\nemerge seemed to reinforce the fact the\nchaos had broken out on some parts of\nthe course. After a ninety-minute lap,\nDave emerged carrying his bike. A big\ncrash on the final part of the course\nhad sent his derailleur into the spokes,\ndestroying his drive train, thus ending\nDave\u2019s race. I set off into the night at\nabout one that morning, and experienced the worst two and a half hours\nI have ever had on a bike. The rain had\nstopped, but the mud had turned into\nsticky, wheel jamming gloop. Some of\nthe early singletrack had indeed fallen\naway into a greasy slope, generally with\na group of mountain bikers stuck at the\nbottom.\nThe 2nd part of the course was\ndrier, however I had only charged my\nlights to do two hours, and just when\nI thought things were improving, my\nlights failed a couple of kilometres\nfrom the changeover. When I finally\nmade it back, not only was Roger wait-ing, but James was there as well waiting\nfor Roger to hand over to him. Roger\nset off into the slowly drying night, for\ntwo more hours of hell.\nWhen Roger finally returned, dawn\nhad broken, and the course had started\nto dry out. Dave was up and frantically\ntrying to get hold of a new derailleur,\nand my bike had similar mechanical is-sues, not to mention the commitment\nto the race issues I was having after\nmy last lap. James, in a desperate bid\nto stay in the race completed a heroic\ntwo-lap stint in just over three hours.\nThe antics of the night had moved us\ninto the top 200 overall, and we were\nstill in the battle for 3rd place with Oxford and Cambridge. With Dave T\u2019s\nbike on the road to recovery, he and\nRoger put in a lap more each to bring\nus within a couple of hours of the fin-ish. Dave T handed over to me, only\nfor my bike to break before I even got\non the course. Roger stepped in getting another solid lap in the bag, before\nhanding back to Dave T, who put in\nthe fastest lap of the race to bring us\nhome only one lap off the universities\npodium, and a devastating 12 minutes\nbehind Cambridge in fourth.\nSolid start for IC futsal\nThank you very much for meeting\nwith felix sports today Catherine!\nFirst things first - how has your\nseason been so far?\nErr, so far in ULU it has been good -we have been doing really, really well.\nBut BUCS has been a different story it\nhas been difficult since we lost a lot of\nplayers last year. Three final years who\nwere key players graduated last year so\nwe now have a fresh young team. Everyone is doing really well and we are\nimproving match by match. I am happy\nat the moment\nSo as I understand it, you are in\nthe same league as the College\nnetball 1sts?\nWell we are in the same ULU league\nbut in one league above them in BUCS.\nI think Imperial got promoted last\nseason.\nSo how are you faring in BUCS?\nWe are currently bottom! We need to\nwin two out of the last three games to\nstay up basically. It is doable and everyone will have to play really well. But\nit is doable. However there are only six\nteams in our league and two go down,\nso it changes quite a lot every season.\nSo you have beaten IC already\nthis year I hear...\nLast Monday, yeah, a good game and\na good victory for us!\nAny more grudge match games\nagainst IC before Varsity?\nI think that is the only game and it is\nquite early on to tell to be honest. For us\nit was a nice boost. Everyone tends to\nimprove a lot as the season progresses\nand as both teams have very changed\nsquads it is very hard to tell.\nSo rate your chances, give me a\nscore line for Varsity!\nIf we can get a similar score as we\ndid on Monday I will be very happy!\n[Medicals won 28-8]. I think it will be a\nlot closer, due to the fact that Varsity is\none of those days when everyone feels\nthe pressure and everyone picks up\ntheir game. So anything can happen.\nLast year the first couple of quarters\nwere very close, but we are confident.\nSo at the moment you are obviously a cut above the College\nteam, but how would you say\nthat the ICSM netballers off-pitch\nantics compare?\nOff-pitch we have a really social club\nat the moment because as well we also\nhave four teams in the club. So we have\na massive range of abilities and they all\nturn up to the weekly socials. We have\ncircles every Wednesday and we have a\nclose mix with the ICSM football boys.\nWe do events with them including a\ntour, more of a drinking tour! This year\nwe hope to do more of a playing tour as\nwell. We are really sociable!\nWhere are you planning to go on\ntour this year?\nCardiff on the 20th of February. Just\nbefore Varsity! So if we don\u2019t play as\nwell that is probably why! Although it\nis definitely a warm up tournament for\nVarsity... we do always play the footballers at netball... and we always win!\nSo you have four teams? That\nmust be hugely beneficial for the\nfirst team to have that depth in\nthe club to bring players up if\nneeded?\nMassively so! The fourth team is new\nand we have only had it for a couple\nof seasons and they are only in ULU\nat the moment. Hopefully we will be\nable to push the thirds and seconds\nup in the BUCS leagues and then we\ncan hopefully get the fourth team into\nBUCS as well. That would really help\nup the numbers.\nWeek 4 in the build up to 25th February 2009. This week, Jack Cornish interviews the ICSM 1st XI Captain\nCatherine Atkin\nWhat would you say if there were\nplans to combine College and the\nMedical Schools sports teams\ninto one \u2018superclub\u2019?\nIt would be very good. But I also think\nit would be difficult. The timings for us\nto play with them would be awkward\nwith the differing commitments. Plus I\nlove being a medic, so I would say NO!\nSo moving on from Netball, who\nelse do you think are doing well\nthis season?\nErm... At the moment I think every\nteam, medics wise, are in quite tough\ndivisions and it seams that it is showing in BUCS. But everyone is working\nreally hard. Our seconds and thirds are\ndoing really well in BUCS at the mo-ment. I know that the rugby boys have\nhad quite a change this season in players so that they are having a tough sea-son. I am not really sure about the other teams to be honest. I think generally\neveryone is having a tough season\n- I don\u2019t think there is anyone top\nof their BUCS league at the mo-ment. I think that most teams\nare mid table maintaining their\nposition in the higher leagues.\nWho do you think will win\nthe rugby at Varsity?\nMedics...I think they will. Last\nyear was an amazing game, very\nexciting. But the Medics still won\nin the end. It is the end score that\ncounts. There was a tiny, tiny\nmoment of sheer panic for the\nmedics. But we were just lulling you into a false sense of\nsecurity!\nWhat is your favourite anti-IC chant for\nVarsity?\nI am not a fan of\nthe chants because in\nmy first year someone chucked a pint\nof snakebite on my\nhead from the top\nof the stands!\nDo you think\nthat once you\nhave gained\npromoted\nthat it is easy\nto maintain\nyour place\nand quality in that\ndivision?\nI think that\nif you have\nbeen promoted\nyou should be\ngood enough to\nbe in the league\nabove - surely\nthat is the point\nof promotion! But\nthen again you\nneed to sustain\nand improve within\nthat league. You can\nthen develop the\nskills needed for the\nleague above and\nyou should be able to\ncontinue going up.\nA true netball aficionado, Catherine has moved\nthroughout the top roles in the Medicals Netball Club\nand is now leading a young first team in a difficult\nBUCS league. A utility player, she fills the positions\nwhere there are gaps, allowing her team mates to\nexcel in their preferred roles. We spoke to her just\nbefore she took her team away to Chichester in an\nimportant BUCS South East 1A match.\nFACT FILE\nName: Catherine Atkin\nTeam: ICSM 1st Netball\nPosition: Utility\nDate of Birth: 11/02/1987\nHometown: Canterbury\nCourse: 4th Year Medcine\nHeight: 5ft 4ins\nWeight: N/A kg\nAsk the captain -Catherine Atkin\nDo you not think that depends\non the league you get promoted\ninto? The lower leagues seem to\nbe very similar, but when you get\nto the top do you not feel that\nthe higher leagues are for those\nuniversities that focus on sports\nso for us it is a lot more difficult?\nI would personally say, netball wise,\nI think we are in the highest division\nwe could realistically get to. We are in\n1A and there is only one division above\nus and those teams train five times a\nweek. That would near impossible to\nget ten people willing to do that or\neven able to do that while trying to get\na degree at IC. So in the premiership\nyou are competing against teams from\nsporting universities with players who\nare in the England development squad.\nIt is impossible to have seven players\nwho are that good with minimal\ntraining.\nDo you think the union should\nconcentrate on sporting excellence or purely on participation?\nAt our university participation is key.\nIt fills the social side of university life. I\nthink you need a mixture between the\ntwo. It is more difficult at a university\nwhere sport is not going to make you\nany better at your degree. Let\u2019s say you\nwere doing sports science, sporting excellence can be up to 20%-30% of your\ndegree. You would need to do that\npractical side.\nDo you think there are teams out\nthere that the College should\nstart focussing on?\nI think if you went through and found\nout who is high up on BUCS. Obviously it is difficult when you have so many\nteam sports to fund. I don\u2019t know about\nthe individual sports - squash, badmin-ton...? I\u2019m not really sure.\nDo you think there should be\nmore focus on other sports\nat Varsity rather than just the\nrugby?\nYes I do - ideally I think all the\nsports should be played at the\nsame place but obviously with\nnetball in Ethos you can\u2019t get\neveryone together. I think all\nthe advertising is good - I\nmade sure I was not in the\npromotional photos!\nI you couldn\u2019t\nplay netball on\na Wednesday\nfor whatever\nreason, what\nwould you be\ndoing?\nMy life\nwould be\nover! I\nwould\ndefinitely do\nanother\nteam\nsport,\nsomething\nlike hockey\nor lacrosse.\nDefinitely an\nall girls team\nsport.\nSporting idols?\nFemale: Dame Kelly\nHolmes. Male: Sir Steve\nRedgrave.\nIC Netball have stepped\nup to the mark this week and\nposed for page three...so give us\na date!\nWe actually did the naked calendar\nfor ICSM in my first year... I am sure\nsome of the girls would be up for it!\nAnd finally, the standard ques-tion: what is orienteering?\nThey have a map, a compass and\nhave to run around the countryside\nand get to checkpoints and stuff.\nWet, rainy and horrible.\nAnything else you want to say?\nI love netball...that\u2019s about all!\nIt all started on a cold Sunday morning,\nICUAFC setting off at 0700 hours trying once again to overcome its biggest\nadversity; injustice. Lion-O, actually\nfrom the Thundercats, drove the fun\nbus to their destination, the University\nof Sussex.\nWith a squad of just seven, having\njust one hours practice (albeit with the\nwrong players) 48 hours prior to Sunday, would prove a challenge to emerge\nfrom the BUCS South-East Regional\nFutsal Qualifiers with a positive result.\nThe tournament was set up with five\nofthetenparticipatinguniversitiespro-gressing through to the BUCS Championships in Sheffield taking place next\nMarch. In this first day Imperial had to\nplay Hertfordshire 1s, Surrey 1s and\nKingston 1s (the match against Buckinghamshire New University, our final\ngroup opponent will take place on the\nsecond day of the regionals in February\n2009), teams that currently reside in a\nleague above ICUAFC 1st XI.\nHertfordshire were our first op-ponents. They were well trained and\nwent one-nil up quickly with a quick\none-two down the middle and a tap in\nat the back stick. IC were quick to reply with a goal from Portuguese hero,\nGoncalo Pires, who decided dribbling\nhis man once wasn\u2019t enough so embarrassed the same player three times before smashing it in the roof of the net.\nIn the second half Hertfordshire\ncame back stronger. The referee decided to help them not once but four\ntimes in a row. Firstly, a dodgy free kick\nwas given on the halfway line that got\nplayed wide to a player who dribbled\nthe ball out of bounds. Though, the\nreferee chose not only to not to see it\nbut to give another suspect free kick in\na threatening position. Hertfordshire\nsmashed it wide, but that wasn\u2019t good\nenough for the referee and he decided\nto make them retake it. The goal was\nduly scored and unsurprisingly, play\nresumed.\nIC were 2-1 down and heads dropped\ndue to the flagrant refereeing. Hertfordshire, unfazed, took advantage and\nscored again on the counter. Irvine\n\u201cThe Pimp\u201d Howson then restored order by playing a ball down the left to\nPires who squared it to Gui who found\nhimself in front of an open goal. He\nthen took a touch to tee himself up\nbut unfortunately got tackled, but the\nfailed clearance landed on Irv who\nstruck it (first time) into the back of the\nnet to make the final score 3-2.\nNot the best of starts, but it showed\nthe IC had potential. Kingston, the\nnext opponents were more physical.\nThis didn\u2019t detract from the fact that it\nwas a must win game for IC. Squirrel\nput IC in the lead within two minutes.\nGui riskily played with possession at\nthe back and quickly lost it to the opposing striker who equalised after taking it round the keeper. A play by LionO down the left resulted in IC\u2019s second\ngoal of the match.\nAt this point it became clear that Imperial were the better side. They were\npassing it across the back doing nice\nrotations and adopting a strong 2-2\nzonal defence strategy. Things seemed\ngoing IC\u2019s way until a mix up in goal\nled to Kingston\u2019s equaliser. A long ball\nthrown by their goalkeeper into ICs\npenalty box caused panic with Milky\nand Z\u2019mon colliding leaving their striker to poke it in.\nAt this point the game became even\nuntil Irv came on and kept his \u2018Pimp\nHand\u2019 strong. After collecting Milky\u2019s\ngoal kick, he ran past all the opposition\nplayers and slotted it in to regain the\nlead. Kingston managed to equalise to\nleave the score at 3 apiece.\nAfter a few minutes of pressure Kingston lose it and start fouling IC players\nto stop the flowing champagne fut-sal. This led to the first penalty. Pires\nstepped up to the plate but hit the bar.\nIC get another penalty and this time\nGui punts it top left to make it 4-3.\nKingston looked completely out of\nplace and just couldn\u2019t handle the fitness and movement by the players in\nblue. Yet another penalty was given.\nSquirrel stepped up but also struck the\nbar. No problem though as Damian\nsoon after blasted in two goals and Gui\ncompleted his hat-trick to make the\nscore 8-3. Kingston recover and take\nit to 8-5 but Lion-O shattered them\nof any hope by scoring his second and\nmaking it 9-5, which is how it finished.\nImperial finished the day second in\ntheir group and wait to play their final\nopponents followed by the final playoffs in February 2009.\nGui Barbosa\nCycling club riding high...\nBefore late night problems set in\nImperial College Kendo Club with their high ranking guests\n\n"

Don\u2019t\nworry, this isn\u2019t a rant on religion. Well,\nit is to some extent, but it\u2019s more of a\nrant on the way people behave.\nA long time ago, some 2009 years ago\nto be precise, a miracle happened in a\nmanger. For several hundreds of years,\nthis time of year was a celebration\nof that miracle, despite the fact that\nit more than likely happened in the\nspring sometime, but again, let\u2019s not\ndeviate. So Christmas, for centuries\nand even still today is a celebration and\na time for friends and family to get to-gether. How this time is spent together\nhowever, has changed dramatically.\nTake this little family we have right\nhere on these two pages. Without a\ndoubt, these three columnists are, in a\nvery strange and slightly obscure way,\nmy family. You have the two children\nwho just won\u2019t stop bickering at each\nother, yet at the same time you don\u2019t\nwant to stop them bickering because\nyou find them highly entertaining.\nThen you\u2019ve got the more mature, yet\nstill younger than myself, brother who\nkeeps to himself and comments every\nnow and then on how badly the kids\nare behaving. You agree, but again, you\njust can\u2019t help it as it\u2019s just too fun.\nSo this little Christmas dinner we\nhave on these two pages is as dysfunctional as many other \u2018Christmas\nDinners\u2019. Maybe it\u2019s just me and my\nupbringing (in case you haven\u2019t figured this out yet, I\u2019m Serbian!) where\nChristmas dinner meant sitting with\nthe family and enjoying a nice meal.\nThen again maybe it is just all the hype\nthat these holidays seem to get over\nthe television and in films, although\nfor some reason, it aggravates me that\nso many people simply call any dinner\nthey have at this time of year a Christmas dinner, and then proceed to get\na little bit too merry, with the whole\nevening descending into chaos.\nSome of you out there might think\nthat I am being a bit of a hypocrite as\nI have organised several dinners at this\ntime of year where the evening has descended into a bit of a mess. But that\u2019s\nnot the point I want you take away\nhere. Let\u2019s try and not use this time\nas an extra reason to get that little bit\nmore drunk than we normally do, or\nif you are, let\u2019s not call it a Christmas\nDinner, maybe just call it a Winter Dinner so that we can keep those PC people very happy.\nBut what do I care, my Christmas\nisn\u2019t until January so this is just another month for me enjoying endless\nfilms and TV shows. So for now, Merry\nChristmas everyone, and I\u2019ll see you all\nin the new year as felix enters its 60th\nyear. Wow, that cat looks good for its\nage.\nSo this is\nChristmas?\nImperial Girl: Don\u2019t send the\nwrong message with perfume\nAnd I\u2019ll look down and whisper, \u201cNo\u201d\nT\nhe Christmas season is\nhere and with it comes the\nsometimes pointless buying of gifts. Among these\ngifts is bound be choco-lates, jewellery and almost certainly\nperfume. These are arguably the easiest of gifts to buy for a girl. Likewise\nguys might expect to receive a scarf,\ncuff-links and aftershave.\nI like to steer away from chocolates,\nas this is not a Christmas gift but an\nextra 2-3 hours in the gym. Jewellery\nis nice but I honestly tend to find even\nthe people that know me the best get\nmy jewellery taste wrong. It seems that\npeople tend to buy the jewellery they\nfind attractive for someone else, rather\nthan the jewellery the recipient would\nactually find attractive. Finally there is\nthe perfume which is more than likely\nto be brought for a girl by a guy.\nNow this is something of intrigue.\nScientific tests show that we are attracted to our mates via their natural\nscent. A perfume is often used as an\nartificial scent to impersonate what\nthe user deems as more attractive. My\nattraction to a guy has been increased\nten-fold if he smells good. And it\u2019s not\njust that it smells good, it\u2019s that this\nparticular perfume attracts me. I know\nit, every time I smell it. And every\ntime I smell it, I know that however\nI felt about the guy before I smelt it, I\nfeel closer to him afterwards \u2013 even\nthough I still don\u2019t know the name of\nit.\nIthinkit\u2019sthesameforguyswithgirls.\nA girl often becomes more attractive\nwhen she\u2019s not just wearing a nice perfume but the \u201cright\u201d perfume. So this\nbrings me back to the original point.\nWhen a guy buys a girl a perfume is\nhe trying to say this is what I want my\ngirlfriend to smell like, or is it he just\npicking anything up that he thinks is\npopular? If a girl buys a girl perfume\nas a friend, is it recommended that she\nuses that scent because it has been\npicked by someone who isn\u2019t trying to\nattract the girl as partner?\nOne can often find small versions of\nperfumes in a selection pack. Is that really helpful? Or have they blended the\nselection such that all the perfumes in\nthe selection carry at least a few of the\nsame base notes as each other. Or it\nis just a set of the most popular ones\ntogether hence throwing the end user\ninto a frenzy of confusing scents?\nI guess we should take heed this\nChristmas when receiving or buying\nperfume as a gift. We should understand what message we are literally\ngiving off when we use the power of\nthe perfume. I urge you to watch the\nfilm Perfume if you haven\u2019t already, it\nwill surely inspire you to learn more\nabout its importance in modern history to supplement the knowledge we\nalready have on ancient history; such\nas perfumes and the Egyptians.\nMore importantly, if you get in\nright you might be more successful in\nyour relationships!\nMerry Christmas everyone... and see\nyou in the New Year. Keep me posted\n\u2013 imperialgirl@imperial.ac.uk \u2013 over\nand out! x\n\u201cWe should\ntake heed this\nChristmas\nwhen buying\nperfume as a\ngift\u201d\nT\nhe definitive spoken version of the quote I\u2019ve\nmangled above is spoken\nby Leonard Nimoy, and\ncomes from the acclaimed\nvideogame Civilisation IV. It\u2019s originally one of those lost-in-translation\nFrench pieces, spoken by Louis The\nSomethingorother, explaining that he\nWAS the nation of France. It\u2019s spoken\nwith such arrogance and simplicity that\nyou get a feeling for what\u2019s being said.\nAm I an arrogant twat to use this title?\nOf course I am. What did you expect.\nYou know, I was offered the chance\nto face-off IG this week in a one-page\nshowdown, fancy layout and all. I de-clined. I declined because there was\nnothing I found noteworthy in her article last week \u2013 adoption is pretty okay,\nall said \u2013 and the drivel that preceded it\nmade so little sense that fanning a tiny\nember into a fire of argument seemed\ntoo much effort. But I did consider the\ndrivel itself. Because the strange thing\nabout it was, she hardly ever mentioned me.\nRemember the criticisms she had\nof my violent tone? I never said those\nthings. It was the women I spoke to,\nthe women who emailed me who had\nread her columns previously and were\ndisgusted and angry. Remember her\ndislike of my Wikipedia piece? I have\nno Wikipedia piece. Instead it was\nthe inventive and hardworking felix\ncontributor Gilead who had written\nthat; though I have to say that I\u2019m as\noffended by her insulting of his work\nas I would have been had she actually\ngotten her facts right. I found it amusing that she had confused me with so\nmany groups of people. But, on reflec-tion, maybe she was right.\nMaybe she was right, because there\nare a lot of downtrodden and ignored\ngroups of people at Imperial. A lot of\npeople who have to put up with being\nswept under a rug, buried beneath layer upon layer of festering, fermented\nbullshit, dried in the heat of a thousand\nburning egos. A lot of people who were\npromised freedom from stereotypes\nand social standards at university, only\nto find that the standards had followed\nthem along, this time gilded with a thin\nveneer of intellectual superiority. A lot\nof people who are tired of being used as\neasy targets \u2013 easy targets for mindless\narseholes in need of a quick ego boost,\neasy targets for passive-aggressive socialites looking for more worshippers,\neasy targets for pseudo-rebels who\nwant to claim they speak for all wom-en, when most women want to be seen\nas individuals rather than comrades-in-arms in some grand nouveau sexual\nrevolution.\nAnd I thought about these people a\nbit more. I thought about how most of\nthem probably feel quite disconnected.\nThey might have a few friends they can\nrely on, but most of them are broken\nup, kept apart from others out of the\nsimple fact that they are all so individ-ual. Foreign students who are maligned\nbecause people make assumptions\nabout their accents. People with personal principles who are shunned because they won\u2019t spend weekends looking for a quick fuck and a cheap high.\nThe enthusiastic people who slave long\ninto the nights to produce this paper,\nonly to hear it being shat on by every\n\u201cI-could-do-better\u201d dickhead showing\nAngry Geek dit, \u201cJe suis Imperial\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m happy\nto represent\nImperial\u2019s other\nside: I will be\nangry for them\u201d\noff to his friends in the JCR.\nFact is, it\u2019s time these people started\nmaking some noise. It\u2019s time these\npeople decided that University doesn\u2019t\nhave to be another four years of quiet\nendurance. It\u2019s time these people started to get Angry. Because you\u2019re right,\nEmo Girl. There isn\u2019t enough diversity in this paper. There are too many\nvoices chirruping the tired ideas of the\nstudent stereotype. Too many \u201caren\u2019t I\nright, girls?\u201d and \u201cknow what I mean,\nfellas?\u201d But until these people get Angry, I will be Angry for them. If Imperial Girl wants to make me the standard bearer of the ignored, the tired, the\nlonely and the underappreciated, then\nthat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m more than happy to represent Imperial\u2019s other side.\nYou know, because Imperial Girl\nbarely mentioned anything I had done\nin last week\u2019s comment, I found myself\ntaking offence at the illustration and\ncaption, showing a boxer beaten to the\nfloor. In reality, she\u2019d danced around\nme, spitting and swearing at the crowd\nbut never making a move on me. But\nif a fighter is needed, and no-one else\nwill step forward, then believe me - I\u2019ll\nknock my fists together, take a swig\nfrom the water bottle, and take any\nblows coming. But I won\u2019t be floored.\nCompliments of the season. I\u2019ll see\nyou all in a few weeks for Round Two.\nGilead Amit offers a vignette from daily life. Why not?\nW\ne should have a\nboardgameofsome\nkind in the flat\u201d, my\nflatmate said to me\nthe other day.\n\u201cMmm.\u201d I seem to remember\nreplying.\n\u201cI mean, something to play when we\nhave guests. You know, a quiet evening\nin.\u201d\t\t\t\n\u201cUh-huh\u201d, said I, extemporizing; \u201cI\nsaw a game of Anti-Monopoly in a\nshop window round the corner \u2013 \u2018the\ngame for the 21st Century\u2019, it said.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t that be Financial Risk?\u201d\n\u201cYeuch\u201d I smiled appreciative-ly. I turned to the next page in my\ntextbook.\n\u201cHow about a good game of Rummikub?\u201d he suggested.\n\u201cWhy the hell not,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re\nonly young once.\u201d\nLater on in the week, I walked\nthrough the door of our apartment to\nsee a large white bag marked \u2018Hamley\u2019s\u2019 hanging off the back of a chair.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag?\u201d I asked, the familiar sounds of Mario getting his denim overalls handed to him on a platter\nfloated through from the Wii station.\n\u201cBag. What is?\u201d I raise my voice as I\nhang up my coat.\n\u201cThis,\u201d it was revealed to me with a\ndramatic flourish, \u201cis the finest game\nof Rummikub available at Hamley\u2019s.\u201d\nThe comforting blue box was pulled\nout on to the table, the multicoloured\nnumbers grinning at us from the sides\nof the container.\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d I think I said. It may have\nbeen \u201cbrilliant\u201d. I somehow doubt I\nwent for either \u2018cool\u2019 or \u2018nifty\u2019 but the\nexcitement of the moment may have\ngotten to me.\n\u201cWe should play a game at some\npoint,\u201d the beep-beep-beep-bip-bip-beep resumed from down the hall.\n\u201cWell\u201d, said I, producing my girlfriend\nfrom beneath the mountain of clothes\nDecember saw fit to lay on our shoul-ders. \u201cWe could play a game now\u201d.\nA range of distinct sounds of approval came from both prospective Rummikubists. Mario excused himself and\nretired with dignity.\n\u201cHave you played Rummikub before?\u201d asked my flatmate.\n\u201cI love it. I used to play it all the time\nwith my family.\u201d My flatmate and I\nexchange a barely perceptible nod of\napproval.\nWe sit down at the table and within\nthe half hour have managed to remove\nthe cellophane wrapping.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d I remark, putting the\nStanley knife away, \u201cnot since the Tardis has a blue box proved that difficult\nto open.\u201d\n\u201cAre you comparing a multiplayer,\ntile-based board game to intergalactic\ntravel by the side of the Doctor?\u201d asked\nmy flatmate.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe snorts involuntarily. \u201cI like your\nstyle.\u201d Our third wheel was starting to look bemused and not a little\nembarrassed.\n\u201cRight,\u201d said the f.m, opening the\nbox. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d He threw himself among the small brown flaps that\nare somehow meant to support the\nnumber stands. \u201cYou try,\u201d he says petulantly after a while, throwing a tangled\nskein of brown plastic in my direction.\nSnap.\nNo, I didn\u2019t say it. No-one said it. It\nfalls in the same classification as the\nMario theme tune above (yes, that\u2019s\nwhat it was supposed to be). You see\nthe absence of quotation marks? That\u2019s\na stage direction. Important ambient\nnoise intended to lend artistic verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative. All right?\nSnap. Snap. \u201cThere you go.\u201d Snap.\nSnap. Snap.\n\u201cWe\u2019re only three\u201d, remarks my significant other.\n\u201cI got a little carried away.\u201d\nMy flatmate had by this point sunk\nhis teeth into the bag containing the\nnumbered pieces and sprayed them\nacross the table in a random act of sav-agery. \u201cSorry\u201d, he chuckled, his mouth\nstill full of erstwhile airtight plastic.\nThe three of us turn the pieces over\non the tabletop and move them round\nin broad, sweeping movements so\nas to shuffle them properly. In case\nyou haven\u2019t tried it before, it\u2019s difficult to have three people make broad,\nsweeping movements over one small\ntabletop.\n\u201cSorry\u201d I say again, after having\nfetched the antiseptic cream and the\nelastaplast.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she assures me with her\nremaining good eye. \u201cLet\u2019s start playing already\u201d.\nAs I ease back into the twenty centimetres of space left for me between the\ntable and the wall, my flatmate is finishing what seems to me to be a miniature replica of the Taj Mahal made out\nof tiles.\n\u201cVery attractive, I\u2019m sure, but is this\nreally the time for scale modelling?\u201d\nHe raises his eye from the plane of\nthe table and gets up off one knee. \u201cIt\nis time.\u201d He pauses to let the theme\nmusic swell in his imagination: \u201cTime\nyou learned how my family plays Rummikub.\u201d My girlfriend and I exchange\nglances.\n\u201cIn the tile bank\u201d, he says, pointing\nat his diminutive model of the White\nHouse, \u201care 105 of the 106 tiles, divided into fifteen piles of seven. We each\ntake fourteen tiles, which is to say two\npiles of seven, and leave the one tile\nleft over on top as the joker. This tile\ncannot be used in normal play but can\nbe added to your hand if you need it\nin order to complete your final move.\nA move consists either of tiles of different colours with the same face value\nor three or more same-coloured tiles\narranged sequentially from one to thir-teen. Your first move must total more\nthan thirty, in whatever combination\nor set of combinations you have on\nyour stand. You may interfere with the\ntiles on the field of play only after having made the first move. A blank tile,\nonce played, is locked in place and can\nonly be substituted for the numbered\ntile it corresponds to. The other joker...\nGili, where\u2019s the other joker?\u201d\nI hand him the two halves of the\ntile in question, having unintentionally snapped it halfway through the\nmonologue.\n\u201cIt fell.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, well, never mind. We\u2019ll just\nhave to do without it.\u201d\n\u201cWho goes first?\u201d As the baby in the\nroom, I and my two piles of seven have\nthe honour of beginning the game. I\nfiddle around for a few minutes on my\nhighly unstable tile-stand. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cHold on, hold on,\u201d I say with my\ntongue sticking out in concentra-tion. On closer reflection, it probably\nsounded more like \u201cHarnghd arghth\u201d.\nI triumphantly seize a handful of tiles\nand decisively lay them out on the glass\nsurface. \u201cThere. 11, 12, 13, 1 and 2. All\nblue.\u201d I raise my head for the praise\nand adulation I feel I deserve. The two\nlook at me disgustedly, as though I was\nsomething that had just climbed out of\nthe primordial ooze and onto the soles\nof their shoes. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask. A hand\ndescends and firmly hands me back the\n1 and the 2.\n\u201cNo. That\u2019s not how it works\u201d says\nmy flatmate, who looks pityingly at my\ngirlfriend. She edges her seat a few centimetres further away. I bite through a\ngreen eight in frustration.\n\u201cTake three more tiles,\u201d she says to\nme, prompting me to reach for the\npristine model village.\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d\nmy flatmate loudly enquires as he slaps\nmy hand.\n\u201cI was just filling up my stand.\u201d\n\u201cOh no. No reloading. This isn\u2019t\nScrabble. You play, you get through\nyour tiles, you win. Simple.\u201d My girlfriend breaks a nail squeezing the armrest of her chair as white smoke starts\nrising from my ears.\n\u201cSure\u201d she says through clenched\nteeth. \u201cMakes more sense.

Have a Happy New Year and we hope you continue\nto read us in the new term!\n24th\nThe Muppet Christmas Carol\nSongs, Muppets and Michael Caine\nas Scrooge: what more could you ask\nfor? Watching this on Christmas Eve\nwill make you think of the real reason\nfor Christmas, as well as give you a\nlaugh (especially when Tiny Tim gets\nwhat he deserves) and will make you\nsmile and feel merry. Everyone seems\nto love this film and it is clear to see\nwhy - Kermit and his gang give this\noverdone Dicken\u2019s story something\nextra, and the festive cheese level is\nextremely high, without being too\nsickening.\n1st\nDie Hard\nStart December off with a bang - literally - with Bruce Willis killing German terrorists atop a massive skyscrap-er. Filled to the brim with Christmas\nreferences - snow, Santa and annoying\nrelatives - you can sit back and laugh as\ngood ol\u2019 John McClane blasts his way\nthrough villains in bloody and hilarious ways. Who can forget Alan Rickman\u2019s brilliant demise at the end? And\nthen once the carnage is over, we hear\n\u2018Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!\u2019\nplay over the end credits! Awesome!\n2nd\nThe Associate\nWhoopi Goldberg plays a businesswoman whose partner steals all of her\nideas and then gets her promotion,\nbecause he is a man. The only way she\ncan succeed? By pretending to go into\ncommerce with a white businessman!\nHilarious and sometimes touching,\nthis film is guaranteed to put a smile\non your face - especially when Goldberg dresses up as her \u2018associate\u2019 - and\nyou won\u2019t believe the results!\n3rd\nIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life\nPossibly the most depressing film\never made, for those of you who haven\u2019t\nseen it and want to watch something a\nbit more upsetting, then this is the film\nfor you. Just make sure you don\u2019t watch\nthe final uplifting 5 minutes if you\nwant to stay depressed for the rest of\nyour life. But if you do want Christmas\ncheer, make sure you do watch the end,\nor there will be plenty of heads in the\noven this year!\n4th\nThe Back To The Future Trilogy\nFor some reason, I always feel Christmassy and/or happy when I watch\nthese films. Can Marty McFly (Michael\nJ Fox) save his own life when he is sent\nback in time? And what will happen\nwhen he goes into the future? Or into\nthe old West? Possibly the best trilogy\never made!\n5th\nAny or all of the Wallace and\nGromit films\nAny of these will do, or if you must,\nyou could watch all of them. They\nmay not be set at Christmas but they\nbring back the spirit of childhood and\ninnocence!\n6th\nWhile You Were Sleeping\nWhat happens when lonely tollbooth\noperator Lucy (Sandra Bullock) saves\na man\u2019s life, only to be thought to be\nhis fianc\u00e9e at the hospital? She gains\na family, friends, and also a love inter-est. This rom-com has some genuinely\nfunny moments - mainly involving\nthe family she adopts (\u201cThese mashed\npotatoes are so creamy!\u201d) and it really does encapsulate everything about\nChristmas: family, friends and love.\n7th\nMary Poppins\nOh come on! This had to be here!\nEveryone loves Mary Poppins! This\nisn\u2019t set at Christmas either, but who\ncares? What would Christmas be like\nwithout \u2018A Spoonful of Sugar\u2019?\n8th\nWhite Christmas (1954)\nFor those of you who love happy\nendings and cheesy musicals this is\nfor you - but for everyone else: reach\nfor your bucket, as this musical packs\nas much sap in as is humanly possible.\nWith many memorable songs you can\nsing along to, including \u2018White Christmas\u2019 and something about counting\nyour blessings instead of sheep (urgh!)\neveryone enjoys a happy ending in this\nfilm, even though it is about the Second World War.\n9th\nJumanji/ Beethoven/ Any film\nyou watched as a child\nI remember watching these films\nwhen I was really young - and I loved\nthem! Relieve your childhood by\nwatching something YOU cherished as\na child!\n10th\nHome Alone 1 & 2\nThese films are AMAZING. They\nhave everything in them about Christmas, as well as Macaulay Culkin before\nhe\u2026 well\u2026 you know\u2026 it hurts thinking about. Anyway, I personally prefer\nthe second one, Lost In New York, because it really shoves Christmas in your\nface and has a more funny and violent\nway of the villains getting hurt, as well\nas a Toy Shop and that bit in the hotel\nwhen he pretends his Dad is a gangster.\nJust ignore the bird woman.\n11th\nLittle Women (1994)\nIt\u2019s snowy and cold, and in post-Civil\nwar America, Jo (Winona Ryder) and\nher sisters struggle to make life for\nthemselves and everyone else a happy\nplace. Christmassy, life affirming, as\nwell as sad, I think everyone remembers the horrible sister Amy, the piano,\nand the saddest part of all when we realise that Beth isn\u2019t gonna make it\u2026\n12th\nGroundhog Day\nThough technically nothing to do\nwith Christmas, it still has a snowy atmosphere and someone learns life lessons about love. Also this film is just\nso darn brilliant I could watch it every\nday of the year anyway. When anchorman Phil (Bill Murray) gets stuck in the\nsame day, will he use it to his advantage\nor will he be driven insane? And will\nhe ever be able to get the woman of his\ndreams Rita (Andie MacDowell)?\n13th\nMiracle on 34th Street (1947 or\n1994)\nIf this film doesn\u2019t make you believe\nin Santa, then nothing will. Father\nChristmas gets taken to court. Everyone wins (in every way possible). This\nfilm is the equivalent to a big hunk of\nstinky Cheddar - extremely cheesy.\n14th\nBlack Christmas (2006)\nGetting sick of being happy? Then\nthis Christmas themed horror film is\nfor you! A psycho escapes from a mental institution and returns to his former\nhome - now a sorority house. Cue\nbeautiful and really sexy women being\nkilled in disgusting ways - eyeballs are\nplucked, heads roll and Christmas trees\nare decorated with body parts - liter-ally. I just love this film - it is brilliant at\nbeing truly foul in every way - but still\nmakes you feel Christmassy.\n15th\nThe Snowman (1982)\n[the following contains spoilers]\nIgnoring the song about Walking In\nThe Air, this film is really depressing,\nand is ultimately what Christmas is all\nabout. When the Snowman melts at\nthe end, I think all of our hopes and\ndreams melt with him (sniff\u2026). But the\nfilm is still great!\n16th\nThe Lion, The Witch and the\nWardrobe (1988 BBC Version\nor 2005)\nFinally - something with a bit of religion in! But it still has Santa, talking\nbeavers and an enchanted wardrobe\n- a magical Christmas treat! I would\npersonally watch both versions back\nto back - the BBC one with bucktoothed Lucy is just brilliant, but to\nget good graphics watch the modern\none, as there is only so much you can\ntake of flying cartoons mixed in with\nreal actors before you laugh uncontrol-lably. Although saying that, the wolf in\nthe old one still scares me - especially\nwhen Edmund goes to visit the witch\nat her castle and the wolf jumps out.\nAnd how happy was I when that stupid\nfawn got turned to stone - it\u2019s a shame\nhe comes back to life\u2026\n17th\nAn Affair To Remember/ Sleepless in Seattle\nThe first of my back\u2013to-back mara-thon! I would advise all men to watch\nthese with a female present. An Affair To Remember is about a couple\nthat meet on a cruise ship and fall in\nlove. But I don\u2019t think the male population get this film - it reduces women\nto quivering wrecks and leaves men\nconfused as to why. Women must be\npresent when men watch this so they\ncan explain (but I wouldn\u2019t recommend a man watching this unless he\nwas forced to anyway). The first film\nis mentioned a lot in the classic Sleepless in Seattle - will Meg Ryan and Tom\nHanks ever meet so that they can fall\nin love?\n18th\nThe Shop Around The Corner/\nYou\u2019ve Got Mail\nYou\u2019ve Got Mail is a modern remake\nof Shop Around The Corner, so they\nboth have the same story. Two people\nfall in love through letters (or email) but\nhate each other in real life. The original\nis more depressing - it has a suicide attempt in it, so for all of you who want\nsomething that is a bit \u2018gritty\u2019 but still\nhas a happy ending - this is for you.\nYou\u2019ve Got Mail reunites Meg Ryan\nand Tom Hanks to comical effect.\n19th\nStardust\nAwesome film. It is modern, but I\u2019m\nsure it will make its way onto many\npeople\u2019s Christmas rotations. Set in\na fantasy land next to the real world,\na young boy has to catch a star, who\nis now a woman, for the girl of his\ndreams, only to be chased by everyone\nfor it. An all-star cast and great script\nmake this film sparkle.\n20th\nCall Me Claus\nEvery 200 years, Santa must be replaced by a new person - this time it is\nLucy (Whoopi Goldberg), a workohol-ic TV producer who hates Christmas.\nHow will she cope when Santa tells her\nit is her destiny to be the next Father\nChristmas? Low budget, but Whoopi\nalways delivers.\n21st\nA Disney film of your choice\nChristmas is nearly there - treat yourself to a Disney classic! I would probably choose Bedknobs and Broomsticks\nor The Sword In The Stone - but everyone has their own favourites. How\nabout Toy Story 1 or 2?\n22nd\nSanta Claus The Movie\nThis film is shown every single year\non TV- and I\u2019m not sure why! You either love it or hate it - so watch it to\nbe entertained or watch it and laugh at\nDudley Moore and John Lithgow in all\ntheir 80\u2019s glory.\n23rd\nWatch something religious\nWell \u2018tis the season - right? Whether\nor not you believe it\u2019s always good to\nsee something about the real meaning\nof Christmas. The Nativity Story is a\ngood self-explanatory starting point,\nor you could watch The Passion of The\nChrist to get into the story a little bit\nfurther on\u2026\nA\nny excuse to watch more\nfilms is always a good\nexcuse and with all the\ntime off we get at this\ntime of the year, Christmas is such a great time to watch as\nmany films as possible! But just in case\nyou aren\u2019t sure which festive flicks are\nworth your time, I decided to make\nan advent calendar full of fun films\nall about Christmas (or they at least\nevoke what Christmas is all about). So\njoin an internet film rental site, get to\nyour local library, go to HMV or beg\nborrow and steal as many films as you\ncan and lock yourself into your house\n(with ample food supplies of course) so\nthat you can begin your festive movie\nmarathon instead of doing essays, lab\nreports, reading, and visiting dull rela-tives! Because, after all, isn\u2019t that the\nreal spirit of Christmas?\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\nFilm Editors \u2013 Zuzanna Blaszczak and Jonathan Dakin\nwith our movie advent calendar\n\n"

It\u2019s the party\nseason, which undoubtedly means\nattending multiple turkey-worshipping\nsessions, scoffing canap\u00e9s as if your life\ndepends on it and consuming more\nthan your fair share of port and other\nfestive beverages. Just like those poor\ngeese we are stuffing our bellies to the\npoint of discomfort and stretching our\nstomachs in anticipation of The Big\nOne on Christmas Day. Why do we do\nit to ourselves?\nI suppose such feasting and overindulgence is not a modern concept at\nall. At the slightest hint of their supe-riority, the Ancients feasted for days\non end on luxurious morsels and dormice while planning the building of a\nlarge phallic monument to themselves.\nNothing\u2019s changed then.\nThis Saturday, our flat is holding its\n2nd annual Beef Wellington Evening.\nIt\u2019s that one night of the year where\nAsda Smart Price gets abandoned and\nreplaced by the most expensive cut of\nmeat our butcher can offer. As a precursor to this feasting and gluttony\nI had to cleanse my conscience and\nease my lapsed-Catholic guilt by buying multiple gifts for relatives from\nOxfam Unwrapped. I couldn\u2019t afford\nto buy my step-dad a bog or a llama so\nhe will have to settle with a home improvement kit for a disaster area [and\nhopefully take the HINT]. My god-daughter-niece hybrid will receive 100\nSchool Dinners for African children,\nnot Turbo Princess Barbie. Conscience\ncleaned. Job done.\nAs a closet vegetarian, I would dearly\nlike to include more veggie recipes and\narticles in the food section. Reader, if\nyou swing the same way as me please\ndo get in touch with ideas. I don\u2019t\nknow how to come out! I think it would\nruin my relationship with my boyfriend because he is an out and proud\ncarnivore.\nI first realised I was a faux-vegetari-an when we were joined by the Vegan\nbranch of the family for Christmas last\nyear. The imagination that went into\nour planning of the day\u2019s meal was in-fectious. We had delicious Black Bean\nand Nut Roast, Cranberry and Cashew\nCroquettes and a vast selection of colA Very Merry\nVegan Christmas?\nourful vegetables.\nSounds delectable but the lifestyle\nchange that you incur when you become a vegan is large enough that you\nhave to go to that part of the supermarket where only hemp-clad people go...\nI could never do it. Also, the hassle of\nbuying soya based milk, cheese and\nice-cream is just too much. Vegetarianism is the way to go.\nHarking back to last week\u2019s food\ncolumn, Afonso needn\u2019t worry. Cafe\nForum/House of Coffees is safe. Well,\nthe Gloucester Road branch anyway.\nThose of you who frequent the aboveground route to South Kensington tube\nwill have possibly noted a new cafe at\nthe bottom of Exhibition Road? It\u2019s official \u2013 there is a new Cafe Forum!! The\nowners have indeed branched out and\nopened ANOTHER.\nBefore you doubt me, I have tried it\nout and it serves the same pizzas, din-ners, coffee cups, croissants... This is\nthe Gloucester Road version\u2019s younger,\ncleaner, South Kensington dwelling\ncousin. The decor is more farmhouse-kitchen than kitsch and the place was\nempty compared to the original. The\natmosphere will come with time, so\nnow you know about it go and fill the\nplace! All it needs is its student population and habitual old men playing\nchess at midnight.\nMy degree of choice (Chemistry)\ncombines quite well with my love of\ncooking. As my food simmers and\ncooks, I love to think of all those molecules diffusing, breaking down and\nchanging state in order to make me\na tasty dinner. The Royal Society of\nChemistry have also caught on to the\nexciting topic of Food Chemistry, so I\nleave you with a short riddle from the\nRSC to share with family and friends\nthis Christmas.\nIngredients:\n85g of polysaccharide powder, kitchen grade\n1g of sodium chloride, NaCl, table\ngrade\n1 egg (or 2 in areas of high altitude)\nSolution of 230cm3\nreduced-lipid\nbovine lactate\n20cm3\nH2\nO\n1-2 tbsp beef dripping\nAnswers on a postcard.\nThe Boys are Back in Town.\nBar and Grill\u2019 in Covent Garden recently opened the equally eponymous\n\u2018Gilmour\u2019s\u2019. Located on Park Walk in\nChelsea, just by the HSBC bank on\nthe corner of Fulham Road, Gilmour\u2019s\nis billed being the English counterpart\nto Christopher\u2019s, that is, contemporary\nyet understated food based on fine in-gredients. Resplendent in its ever expanding honours list, felix was lucky\nenough to be invited to make a welcome foray into the world of Chelsea\ndining. After wondering whether the\nclientele would realise our suits cost\nless than they would spent on a loaf of\nbread, we were greeted by the restaurateur himself. We were sat in the heart\nof the restaurant, and were able to observe the magic happening, with \u201cJeff\nthe Chef\u201d formerly of the Rex Whistler\nrestaurant at the Tate Britain keeping\nan impressively un-Ramsayesque cool\nhead when faced with a busy Friday\nnight.\nOn first glance, it may seem that the\nmenu is perhaps a little safe, uninspired\neven. However, after having eaten the\nfood itself it becomes apparent that\nthis is Gilmour\u2019s greatest strength. The\npurpose of the food is not to be overtly\ndelicate and ornate, but to give pleasure to the customers - the portions are\nrefreshingly large, and ridiculous garnishes are not to be found anywhere.\nThis is a whistle stop tour of the highlights of British cuisine, albeit tastefully modernised and with a few gems\nfrom abroad thrown in to give balance\nand variety.\nAlmost inevitably, given Gilmour\u2019s\nother culinary ventures, there is a\nstrong influence from across the pond.\nBeefburgers, cranberries, the Caesar\nsalad (technically a Mexican invention,\nfact fans) sit alongside shepherd\u2019s pie,\nOxfordshire blue cheese and cod and\ncockle fishcakes. Similarities continue\nwith the obvious emphasis and attenGilmour\u2019s HHHHand a half!\n9 Park Walk, SW10 OAJ\nPhone: 020 7349 6800\nwww.gilmoursparkwalk.com\nPrice: \u00a330 per head\ntion to detail placed on steak. Two\ndifferent sized rib-eyes are available\nat Gilmour\u2019s, both twenty eight day\nmatured Aberdeen shorthorn cattle,\nnaturally. In my infinite generosity, I\nallowed my not-so-glamorous date for\nthe evening, wannabe \u2018gastronaught\u2019\nMr. Gault, select the steak freeing me\nto instead choose the Suffolk belly\npork. Impressively this came with a\ngenerous portion of the most perfectly\ncooked crackling I have ever tasted.\nAlthough, to my heathen palate a little more of the slow gin gravy would\nhave been desirable, the feather light,\ncreamy mashed potato more than\nmade up for it. Seafood lovers are also\nexcellently catered for, with sea bass\nfillet and lemon sole with chips being\ntwo of the main courses on offer.\nThe dessert menu exemplifies all\nthat is good about the Gilmour\u2019s ethos.\nThat most classic yet maligned of British deserts, the knickerbocker glory,\nprovides the taste buds with a welcome\nnostalgia trip to the English seaside.\nThe walnut and cranberry tartlet I\nchose managed was certainly my personal highlight of the meal. And don\u2019t\nget me started on its accompaniment,\nCalvados cream. Calvados is a French\napple brandy that, as a drink, I can take\nor leave. But in cream it is transformed\ninto the food of the gods. The memory\nof it makes me salivate.\nSo there you have it: nice boutique\nrestaurant in Chelsea officially better\nthan the boxed noodle gloop in the\nSAF. Whilst Gilmour\u2019s is undoubtedly\ntowards the top end of the average stu-dent, you are certainly getting value for\nmoney. Expect to pay \u00a330-35 a head for\nthree courses, coffee, and a cheapish\nbottle of wine. It is definitely more of\na place to take a loved one rather than\na big gaggle of friends, and the warm\ncosy atmosphere is romantic but in a\nnatural, unforced way.\nFor lovers of food and drink one of the\nmost amazing things about studying at\nImperial must be the sheer variety of\nmarkets, caf\u00e9s, delis and restaurants\nthroughout London. From Bengali to\nFrench, Moroccan, Thai, Turkish or\neven the \u201cmodern fusion\u201d to be found\nin the SAF, the capital offers gastronomic choices in abundance; indeed\nyou could argue that the hardest part\nof eating out is deciding where exactly\nto dine.\nUndoubtedly the best way to find\nquality places to satisfy your ravenous\nstudent appetite and avoid some of\nthe utter shite out there is to get a recommendation from someone, at least\nthen the place is tried and tested. But\nwhere should you start if you are new\nto food scene, strapped for cash and\nyour friends are generally prefer lager\nto langoustine?\nFirstly do your research. Decide if\nyou are going out with friends or with\nsomeone special, have an idea of your\nbudget, scour the internet, read the\nreviews and check out the restaurant\nwebsite. Secondly in my experience\nyou can\u2019t go wrong with a well respected name. There are a good many\nrestaurateurs that own upmarket res-taurants, that also run smaller, less expensive places that are well on the way\nto serving exceptional food and are still\nwithin a student budget for that special\noccasion.\nChristopher Gilmour, owner of the\neponymous \u2018Christopher\u2019s American\nSo named because it originates from a woman in\nSwitzerland who passed this recipe onto my moth-er. Her name and relation to my mother have since\nbeen forgotten. Such information is deemed useless and irrelevant when pouring love and effort\ninto this cake and subsequently wolfing it down.\nAt school I used to bring this cake in every year on\nmy birthday and it was reduced to a small pile of\ncrumbs well before the bell to signal the end to our\nmorning break.\nAt first I resolved never to pass on this recipe but\nI thought I would for the sake of others who will\nhopefully fall into a deep cocoa/sugar intoxication\nafter eating a substantial portion!\nWhen it comes to baking the quantities are a rough\nguide: I like to add just a splash more of the \u201cricher\u201d ingredients (cocoa powder, chocolate sauce,\ncream) just to really make it more indulgent and it\nusually works wonders for the end product.\nGround almonds makes this a pricier cake to bake\nbut as far as I\u2019m concerned good food is worth\nspending money on as it is, after all, necessary to\nlive. This is best cooked in an electric oven. A fan\noven will make it ever so slightly drier.\nPre-heat the oven to 180\u00b0C.\nMix together in a bowl the dry ingredients:\n2 cups of self raising flour\n1 cup of cane sugar\n1 cup of ground almonds\n1 cup of chocolate powder (I use Green and Blacks\nHot Chocolate Drink)\nPinch of salt\nSwiss Chocolate Cake\n2 tsp baking powder\nMix together in a separate bowl the wet ingredients:\n1 cup of cream\n1 cup of milk\n2 eggs\n125g chocolate sauce (M&S Fair Trade Dark chocolate truffle sauce: heat the pot up in the microwave\nuntil its liquid and add just over half. Keep the rest\nto smother on top after the cake has cooled)\nCombine the wet and dry ingredients, folding them\ninto each other.\nPut into any cake tin you like. It is best to line with\ngreased greaseproof paper.\nBake in the oven for approx. 50-60 mins although all\novens vary. If you are using cupcake moulds, reduce\nthe cooking time by approximately half. The liquidity of the batter will also affect baking time so keep\nchecking the cake with a \u2018skewer\u2019 (a knitting needle\nor chopstick is perfect) after 45 mins, every 5-10 mins\nor so. Once the skewer comes out clean the cake is\ndone. If you notice the cake is getting a little burnt on\ntop half way through baking then lie tin foil over the\ntop. Remember, never open the oven before half the\nbaking time has elapsed or the cake will sink.\nIcing options: I usually pour over some of the remaining chocolate sauce and it let harden.\nA slice served drizzled (or doused!) with double\ncream is also delicious. NEVER taint this recipe with\npre-prepared icings or canned whipped cream.\nWrittten and Created by Caz Knight\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFriday 12 December 2008 felix\nFood\nJames Copley and Joe Gault salivate over tarts and [pork] belly\nA typical veggie Christmas dinner.

In addition, a one-day general strike \u2013which was\nplanned before the shooting by trade unions - added to the current strain\nbetween the Greek state and society.\nGreece has seen several one-day strikes during the year in protest against\nthe government\u2019s economic reforms in the midst of a worsening economy,\nand the striking workers have demand Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis\u2019\ngovernment be replaced. The government\u2019s call for calm has largely been\nignored and many fear the violence could last for days.\nGreece: Riots after shooting of 15 year\nold continue in major cities\nPakistan: Believed masterminds\nbehind Mumbai attacks captured\nPakistani police are questioning two militants captured in a raid, who are\nsuspected of being the masterminds behind the recent attacks in Mumbai.\nWitnesses reported seeing Pakistani military helicopters and troops approach a camp in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, before explosions were\nheard. Pakistan has been under intense pressure from India to act against\nmilitants on its side of the border after the Mumbai attacks which left at least\n170 people dead.\nAbout a dozen people are being held after several similar raids in the past\nweek, and Pakistani\nPrime Minister Yousuf\nRaza Gilani said the\narrests showed that Pakistan was doing all it\ncould to track down the\nattackers. Indian police\nare also investigating\nlinks to home-grown\nterrorism in their hunt\nto find those responsible for the attack.\nEdited by Hassan Joudi\nYes that\u2019s right, felix is one year older\nand has reached the ripe old age of 59.\nThe very first issue of felix was printed\non the 9th December 1949. Back in the\nolden days, felix was produced on a\ntypewriter; unconfirmed reports suggest that even without the help of a\nword processor and spell-checker, the\nnumber of spelling and grammar mistakes were lower than in felix of recent\nyears.\nTen years later, felix was edited by R.F\nKerrod, who had three typists (Sheila,\nLiz and Carol) at his disposal!

Nice.\nIs this math-rock? Math-pop? Indie-dance-math-punk? Whatever, its ace and you knows it. I once sat next to them in Durrr - does\nthat make me cool? Damn right it does.\nFlying Lotus\nLos Angeles\nWarp Records\nThis album is the definition of the underground L.A. sound, embodying the best of a new emerging scene that has come out of The\nAngels in the last few years - eclectic electro (eclectro) synth, bass\nheavy and floral.\nRelatively new to the music scene with only a couple of odd\nsamplers and EP\u2019s to this name, this release is Flying Lotus\u2019 first\nto achieve any amount of mainstream success, and hopefully not\nthe last.\nLos Campesinos!\nHold On Now, Youngster...\nWichita\nI still can\u2019t say it right, what kind of a stupid name is this anyway?\nLuckily for them our reviewers say that they\u2019ve got the tunes to\npull it off (that means, the music sounds good, not it is nice to\nmasturbate to). Personally, I\u2019m more of Jofo fan, not that the two\nare mutually exclusive, but for kind of similar sounding bands\nthere has to be a bit of favouritism.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a great album and anyone who don\u2019t like\n\u2018You Me Dancing\u2019 or \u2018My Year in Lists\u2019 don\u2019t got no brains.\nM83\nSaturdays=Youth\nEMI\nAn album looking back at teenage troubles in the 80\u2019s doesn\u2019t\nsound too appealing does it? Well you\u2019re wrong there, it\u2019s a great\nidea. A loving homage to the past, Saturdays=Youth manages to\nsounds fresh and exciting without ending up cheesy or clich\u00e9d as\ncould have happened if the album hadn\u2019t been masterminded by\nelectronic-shoe-party god Anthony Gonzalez.\nThere\u2019s no filler here \u2013 each song fits perfectly, meaning this\nalbum well deserves it\u2019s place in any end of year list.\nMGMT\nOracular Spectacular\nSonyBMG\nMGMT are pretty big up in the game right about now, but do you\nreally like them? Really? Don\u2019t you think they are a bit \u2018flavour of\nthe month\u2019? Will you be listening to this band in a year\u2019s time?\nWhen your kids search through your CD collection in 20 years and\nfind your copy of Oracular Spectacular, will you be able to say with\npride \u201cThat\u2019s what we used to listen to, not like that shit you and\nyour idiot mates listen to now\u201d or will you feel a pang of shame that\nyou spent your life listening to this emotionless vacuous drivel?\nPortishead\nThird\nUniversal\n\u201cIf I gotsta bring it to you cowards then its gonna be quick /All your\nmens up in the jail before, suck my dick / And all them other cats\nyou run with - get done with, dumb quick / How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit?\u201d It\u2019s Beth Gibbobs distinctive\nvoice and vocal style which makes this album recognisable as Portishead. Musically it\u2019s more experimental than their previous work\nwith a darker, more gritty atmosphere. With the support of nearly\nall our reviewers, Portishead must be doing something right.\nTV On The Radio\nDear Science\n4ad\nTV or \u2018television\u2019 is a popular entertainment medium involving\nboth visual stimuli and audio ones. Radio as a medium only encompasses the latter of these. For TV to be on the radio, one would\nmiss the visual part of the broadcast all together, only experiencing\nthe audio part. Thus, the band \u2018TV On The Radio\u2019 either have little\nconception of these two media platforms, or else are indulging in\nsome kind of ironic funny-business. Careful, boys! Irony can be a\nslippery adversary, but if you master her you will be rewarded.\nVampire Weekend\nVampire Weekend\nXL Recordings\n\u2018K\u2019 is an important letter to pronounce correctly when addressing\na Russian bartender. \u201cVoda\u201d is water, while \u201cVodka\u201d is a beverage.\nThe \u2018k\u2019 is equally important for Vampire Weekend, being the eleventh letter and beginning of the fourth syllable of their name.\nTheir s/t album was one of those records filled with summery\npop songs that can be heard everywhere constantly for the three\nmonths we have away from this godawful place. Something about\nPaul Simon having done it all before\u2026.\nYouthmovies\nGood Nature\nDrowned in Sound\nWith a dramatic change in sound to go with their new shortened\nname, Youthmovies\u2019 experimental pop album Good Nature made\na large impact on the blogging scene but didn\u2019t receive the mainstream success that it well deserves.\nMixing loads of genres up in one album normally leads to a dis-jointed, haphazard feel but Youthmovies manage to pull it all together crafting an excellent album of musical song rhythm/tune\ncombos.\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\nA retrospective: Top ten of 2008\nTwo plus eight equals ten. Top ten! 2008 has been a memorable year in music, and it is with a heavy heart\nand several crates of Lambrini Bucks Fizz that we will soon see it draw to a close. So what does 2009 have to\ncontend with? Here\u2019s felix\u2019s top ten albums of 2008 as voted for by the music.felix reviewing team.\nThe third single from The Shortwave\nSet\u2019s Danger Mouse-produced sophomore album sees these \u201cVictorian\nFunksters\u201d continue in their quirky,\npsychedelic-pop ways. \u2018Glitches \u2018n\u2019\nBugs\u2019 is a bouncy whirl of sunshine-y\nfluff with the kind of crunchy lo-fi production that\u2019s straight out of The Flaming Lips\u2019 school of not-quite-from-this-plane-of-existence whimsy. Pettitt and\nBjorsne take turns on singing verses\nbefore duet-ing on the euphoric cho-rus. I couldn\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re going on about and they very much stick\nto pop\u2019s \u201ceverything must rhyme!\u201d style\nof song writing, but I guess that only\nmakes the tune even more insanely\ncatchy. The single includes a club-ready mix, but it\u2019s Marshmallow Mike\u2019s\nremix that\u2019s worth noting as he piles up\nthe psychedelia, slathers on the synths\nand splatters chirping electronica all\nover the track. It\u2019s the kind of song that\nmakes you open your window in the\nmorning hoping to see people bouncing to work on space-hoppers while\nyour house functions with the aid of\nclunky Wallace and Gromit-esque con-traptions. Or something.\nJorge Costa\nThe music world\u2019s most impressively\nmoustached man (yeah, keep trying\nEugene H\u00fctz!) is currently touring\nthe U.K. in a welcome return to working with his band of 25 years, the Bad\nSeeds, who (in my opinion) boast the\nbest band name of all time.\nHaving turned his hand to writing\nsoundtracks, screenplays, and acting,\nNick is back doing what he does best:\nbellowing out his own poetic lyrics in\nhis distinctive deep, sexy growl.\nConstantly referred to as something\nof a goth-rock-postpunk-country-experimental-ballad-songwriter, I feel\nNick Cave has skated around such\ngenre labels with ease, and with a back\ncatalogue several pages long, carved\nhis own distinct and incomparable\nsound.\nTheir recent album: \u201cDig!!! Lazarus\nDig!!!\u201d is one of their best, raw and\nbeautiful from the first track to the\nlast, a sweeping landscape of deep\nbasslines, twangy scratchy guitars and\ngospel-like organs. It is good enough\nthat you will forgive them for the superfluous punctuation in the title.\nNick Cave has shed the tragic tortured soul crooning that reverberates\nthrough previous albums but retained\nthe dark humour, strong imagery and\nraw sexuality which have always been\nstrong themes in his music.\nNick Cave certainly seems to find\nhimself in a much better place these\ndays than his years addicted to heroin\nand frequently dropping acid could\nThe Hours, Antony Genn and Martin\nSlattery, already have a pretty impressive CV between them boasting working with the Joe Strummer, Pulp, and\nElastica. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have been\nquite so surprised when Ronnie Wood\nbustles past me to try and get a bit\nnearer the front. Also in attendance\nwas Serj from Kasabian.\nThe venue, Proud Galleries, tucked\naway inside the stables market in\nCamden is an amazing conversion\nof a stable block retaining most of its\noriginal features creating quite a surreal atmosphere. This continued when\nthe band took to the stage in front of\nTape Song is the latest offering from\nAllison Mosshart and James Hince\nas the Kills. Mossharts voice, initially quite understated, seduces you\nthrough the song to a more urgent\nchorus with simple repeated lyrics,\n\u2018You\u2019ve got to go steal ahead\u2019. The band\nhas always shown a tendency for minimalist lyrics, this being no exception.\nProduction seems to have stepped up a\nfew notches for the single version, and\nmakes it certainly one of their more\nradio friendly songs but at the expense\nof something very fundamental. The\nband\u2019s lofi charm and raw energy are\ndiffused by extra layers such as added\nguitars, and it makes the song sound\nbit too polished for its own good. The\nB Side \u2018London Hates You\u2019 on the\nother hand feels like the band are back\nin their natural environment. It\u2019s raw\nwith fuzzy edges and hints at influences such as The Velvet Underground\nand PJ Harvey. Despite perhaps being\noverdressed, Tape Song has a good\nskeleton underneath and if your intrigued I would definitely recommend\nchecking out the single\u2019s parent album\n\u2018Midnight Boom\u2019.\nIf you haven't already heard about Gaslight Anthem, chances are you will be\nhearing a lot about them in the next\nyear to come. Hailing from the home-state of Bruce Springsteen and the\nmore punkier likes of Bouncing Souls\nand Thursday, this young New Jersey\nquartet have managed to reference all\nthese diverse influences in a soul-stir-ring brew of soulful punk and bluesy\ntinges with their latest effort the \u201859\nsound\u2019. Having recently finished a giant US tour with Alkaline Trio, Thrice\nand Rise Against, Gaslight Anthem are\nin UK for a mere three dates as warm-up to their full European tour next\nyear, which is going to include a headline slot for the NME Awards Show at\nShepherds Bush Empire. The Astoria\nII show tonight is completely sold out,\nmost likely driven by the flurry of recent media activity surrounding the\nband, including rave reviews for the\nalbum and their previous gigs in the\ncapital and a coveted slot at Reading\nFestival from the likes of Rolling Stone,\nPitchfork and Kerrang to name but a\nfew magazines.\nThe two support bands for tonight's\nshow are the King Blues and Former\nCell Mates, both London-based hy-brid-punk bands that are part of a\nSingle Review\nThe Shortwave Set\nGlitches \u2018n\u2019 Bugs\nWall of Sound\nHHHHI\nIt is time that we wrapped up this year\nfor good. I\u2019m sure that Christmas is on\nyour mind. Mince pies, mulled wine,\nSanta and his little helpers dishing\nout presents, carol singing, Christmas music helping to get your feet and\ntoes moving and even hopefully being\ngranted with a white Christmas and\nsome mischief under the mistletoe. It\u2019s\nopen-ended for sure. Talking of Christmas tunes, Christmas hasn\u2019t officially\narrived until I hear my favourite which\nis the classic \u2018Last Christmas.\u2019 How can\none resist a bit of Wham? You might,\nbut I admit defeat on this one. \u2018Last\nChristmas, I gave you my heart/But the\nvery next day, You gave it away/This\nyear, to save me from tears/ I\u2019ll give it\nto someone special.\u2019\nFor me, like any reasonable being,\nChristmas is a time of reflection where\nI think, honestly, what has happened\nto me this year, if anything at all. Clich\u00e9d and all, but you cannot forget\nthe good, the bad and the miscellaneous that touched our lives this year. In\nterms of music, this last issue of the\nterm, we have a diverse array of the\n\u2018Top 10 albums of the 2008,\u2019 compiled\nby our lovely and faithful reviewers.\n2008 has brought us a mixed bag of\nmusical talents, from Duffy to Cage\nthe Elephant to Katy Perry. Personally,\nI have fallen for Bon Iver, not the usual,\nconventional type of mainstream pop/\nrock band that have catapulted onto\nthe scene this year. What captured\nme and many other listeners is probably their effortless beautiful, laidback\nindie rock/folk acoustic style of ambience and emotive soundscapes, devoid\nof complication, of artificialness and\noveruse of fancy technology, with only\nthe aching poignancy of the music dictating it all. Diverging from my roots\nin the so-called mainstream music, I\nhaven\u2019t regretted picking up this album\nand adding it to my Itunes library. Be\nbrave and try new things. That is one\nof my inherent mottos that I have adhered to as a kid and I shall continue\nto stick to it, regardless of outside in-terference. So, let\u2019s see if any of the finest records of the year has winded up\nin your collections or not, if not, some\nuseful hinting to Santa could well do\nthe job.

Bon Iver aka Justin Vernon\nChristopher Walmsley\nChristopher Walmsley\na large Damien Hirst designed psyca-delic skull whom is another one of the\ngroup\u2019s \u2018Famous Friends\u2019.\nTaking to the stage, the band played\nthrough a set of piano and guitar based\nBritpop starting with fan favourite,\nthe anthemic single from their previous album \u2018Ali in the Jungle\u2019 which sets\nthe room pulsating with energy. As\nthe evening progresses its clear some\nsongs are stronger than others. For example their new single, piano led \u2018See\nthe Light\u2019 contrastingly was far less upbeat and felt rather bloated. It seemed\nto meander around the point, trickling\nrather than flowing with the more ambient landscape of the song becoming\ngradually disinteresting.\nUnfortunately there are countless\nother bands with this sort of sound and\ntonight The Hours didn\u2019t really exhibit\nanything to distinguish them from the\npack. There was energy and the performance very technically very good,\nbut there wasn\u2019t really a spark in their\nmusic to entice me.\nUshnish Banerjee\nnow-burgeoning underground scene\nthat is on the brink of breaking out into\nthe mainstream. Former Cell Mates\nput on a decent show with their brand\nof good-time rock and just like a good\nappetiser when you're dining out, it\nmakes you itch for the main meal and\nthe crowd's anticipation for the headline act is already getting feverish. That\nthe gig is on a Friday night means that\ngetting slightly tanked is entirely justi-fiable, so the bars at the former Mean\nFiddler venue are being kept busy, as\nthe punters all join in for a few drinks\nto lubricate themselves for the night\nahead.\nNext up are the King Blues, a band\nthat have the makings of UK's very own\nBedouin Soundclash, they really get\nthe crowd going with their feel-good\nanthemic choruses and fusion of reg-gae, urban and punk in one passionate\nmix. The highlight of their set comes\nwhen they dedicate a song to the British Nationalist Party in one visceral\nand bileful reggae track which sees the\nsinger really coming into his own with\nbiting aggression and a palpable contempt towards the rascist ideals of the\nnotorious political party.\nWith the support bands out of the\nway, all that's left is for Gaslight Anthem to show if they're worth as much\nlive as they are on record. Opening\ntheir set with the Dickens-influenced\n\u2018Great Expectations\u2019, the band are absolutely on fire tonight and that the\ncrowd is singing back every word of\nevery song shows just how much impact this quartet is having on our capi-tal. Ploughing through a passionate set\nthat includes such gems as their latest\nsingle 'Old White Lincoln' and the title\ntrack of the album '59 sound', singer\nBrian Fallon shows just how much\nheart and soul a guy can put into his\nsongs as he has every member of the\n1000-strong crowd in the palm of his\nhand. At the bar, I even talked to a\nfew guys who trekked all the way from\nCornwall to come see 'their favourite\nband' just for the single show.\nI have been to a lot of gigs in my time\nand I must say that I have never experienced an atmosphere so friendly and\npassionate from a crowd as tonight,\nthis gig had the magical workings of\none which sees a band being propelled\nto the ranks of legends simply through\ntheir ability to just mesmerise audiences with an arsenal of intricate and\nsoul-stirring tunes. Just before the set\ncloser, Brian Fallon takes a humble opportunity to thank the crowd for showing them the intense love and support\nthey are receiving in the UK before\nclosing the set with the anthemic 'Say\nI Won\u2019t Recognise' from their first release from 2007. For those fortunate\nenough to have attended this gig, it is\ntruly a memory to embrace as this will\nprobably be one of the last opportunities to witness Gaslight Anthem at a\nvenue the size of Astoria, they are definitely destined for bigger things in the\nvery near future.\nGig Review\nNick Cave\nHHHHI\nAlexandra Ashford\nhave led to (Shane McGowan has not\nbeen so lucky\u2026).\nHis enthusiasm and love of performing shines through as he giddily darts\naround the stage in ways a skinny-jeaned indie front man half his age\nwouldn\u2019t keep up with.\nThe Bad Seeds consist of men with\nvarious degrees of facial hair ranging from clean shaven to full on hobo\nbeard, with a plethora of keyboards,\ndrum kits and musical instruments\nwhich they play with the incredible\nskill and relaxed ease that must only\ncome from decades of playing.\nThe Troxy is an interesting choice\nof venue, a pastel-coloured, art deco\nlisted building out on the DLR line in\nLimehouse, usually used for weddings\nand conferences.\nThe sound quality however, was\ncloser to perfection than most regular\ngig venues can achieve. Being slightly\nlate due to vague directions (3 minutes\nwalk from Limehouse, but which di-rection?) the band were finishing their\nopening song when I walked in, before\nlaunching into the title track of \u201cDig!!!\nLazarus Dig!!!\u201d which stirred up the atmosphere with it\u2019s punchy chanting.\n\u201cBlack Betty\u201d is an old American folk\nsong made famous by Leadbelly in the\n1940s, given fresh drive by tribal drumming and Nick Cave\u2019s deep roar. The\nhigh point of the set was \u201cThe Mercy\nSeat\u201d, a haunting rapturous anthem,\ntelling the tale of a man about to be\nelectrocuted by electric chair. (Which,\nby the way, is a song written by Nick\nCave that was covered by Johnny Cash,\nas many supposed Cash aficionados\nought to learn.)\nThe band finished by taking requests\nfrom the audience which included \u201cWe\nCall Upon the Author\u201d as well as \u201cI Let\nLove In\u201d and what Nick Cave sardonically called his most spiritual song,\n\u201cHard on for Love\u201d.\nGaslight Anthem just chillin\u2019, relaxin and all that stuff\n\n"

Hopefully my list of recommendations the week before had made your\nlife slightly easier, but if you were looking for something more special then\nplease read on.\nIf you recall my Stuff Live article a\nfew weeks back, I mentioned a cool\ncompany called DIGISKIN who offers\na revolutionary way of personalising\nyour gadget - it could be a computer mouse, a mobile\nphone, a laptop, a game\nconsole, a camera etc.\nIt caught my attention\nbecause not only\ndo they provide a\nskinning solution\nthat beats the\nordinary fugly\nsilicone (not to\nbe confused\nwith silicon,\nas most people\ndo) skins by miles,\nbut also the finish\nlooks as if the gadget was\ncustomised just for you by the\noriginal manufacturer.\nThe process is quick and simple, just\nas I had witnessed at the expo: starting with the customer selecting an artwork from the company\u2019s catalogue of\nnearly 2000 designs, or you can even\nsubmit your own high resolution picture and tell DIGISKIN how to resize\nand place it; the company then prints\nthe artwork out onto a thin foil of just\n0.05mm thickness - bear in mind that\nthe average silicone case is about 2mm\nthick; finally, both the skin and your\ngadget are placed in one of their ma-chines, which uses vacuum-forming\nmethod to tightly wrap the skin onto\nyour gadget; any excessive foil is then\ncarefully removed by their well-trained\nstaff. All this can usually be done within\nthirty minutes on the average phone.\nSoon after the expo DIGISKIN\u2019s\nManaging Director, Ricardo da Silva,\ngot in touch with me and generously\nprovided a sample for my beloved\niPhone, as shown in the above picture.\nAt first sight it really looked like a final\ntouch from Apple (who would never do\nsuch thing), instead of it donning some\ncheap, thick skin. Holding it in hand\nonly strengthened my above thought,\nas it is incredibly thin, and I also\ndiscovered another hidden\nbenefit: my iPhone\nis not as slippery as before.\nThe round\nedges below the\nsilver bezel were\nwellwrapped\ntoo \u2013 I don\u2019t\nknow how\nthey did it but\nthey certainly\ndid well. I also did\na key-scratch test -something that I never\nasked Ricardo about - and\nsurprisingly the DIGISKIN\nsurvived my strong strikes, as\nwitnessed by my felix colleagues.\nUpon showing off my beautifully\nskinned iPhone in front my colleagues,\nthe first reactions were all \u201cwow\u201d with\na smile. It definitely wasn\u2019t to do with\nthe artwork (let\u2019s face it: I could have\nchosen something better, maybe something that would display my heterosex-uality) \u2013 it was the fact that it looked\nlike the artwork was printed directly\non the phone. My friends were keen to\nlook at the phone up close to see how\nthin the skin was, and unsurprisingly\nthey were all very impressed. If you see\nme walking by on campus, feel free to\nask for a show-and-tell.\nSuch ingenious product and service could only come from one of the\nsmartest countries in the world, a\ncountry whose people I had always admired \u2013 Singapore. DIGISKIN is a relatively young company and has spent\nthe past five years mostly in research\nand development. Just two years ago\nthey opened their first store in The Cathay - one of the country\u2019s oldest shopping malls, and more recently another\nat the Bugis mall. Having just landed in\nthe UK, the ambitious company is also\nheading towards USA, South Africa,\nAustralia, France and Indonesia.\nDIGISKIN is now offering their debut UK service in the basement Electronics Department of Selfridges,\nOxford Street, which offers a one day\nturn-around service as well as same\nday, provided orders are placed before\n12:00. With same-day service customers will receive their devices back by\n19:30. Better yet, a flagship store is due\nto open in January next year, which will\noffer a much quicker service of as fast\nas half an hour, and mobile phone users\nwill even get a loan phone during that\nperiod. If your DIGISKIN somehow\ndoes come loose around the corners,\nthe folks at either store will be happy\nto reattach it for you free of charge, but\nlooking at mine I\u2019m sure it will stay in\nplace for a good period.\nOf course, the real question is \u201cHow\nmuch?\u201d Prices are size-dependant,\nstarting from \u00a325 for something like a\nmouse, but generally \u00a335 for small devices and \u00a355 for large. As of next week\nyou should be able to buy DIGISKIN\ngift vouchers from Selfridges, which\nwould make great Christmas presents\nfor the gadget lovers around you. Many\nof you will be visiting Selfies soon any-way, so do check out the DIGISKIN\nbooth while you\u2019re there.\nOptimus Prime owns my iPhone\nWant to personalise your gadget the special way? Richard Lai shows you what DIGISKIN can do for you.\nOptimus Prime is obviously way cooler than the dull silver apple.\nEXCLUSIVE 10% DISCOUNT\nFOR IMPERIAL COLLEGE STUDENTS\nUpon showing your valid Imperial College student card at the\nRegent Street DIGISKIN store (opening in early January 2009),\nyou are entitled to an exclusive 10% discount on all products.\nDIGISKIN\u2122 reserves the right to change the above offer from time to time with or without\nprior notice.\nDIGISKIN also does XBOX 360!\nMake your mouse more unique\nDIGISKIN Walkthrough\n1.

After a reasonable start, we have got into\nthe swing of things and hope you have\nseen the improvement in the sports\npages.\nWe have slightly tweaked the format to mirror that of the back page, to\nsome extent, and we have reduced the\namount of text-heavy articles, like we\nsaid we would!\nA room for improvement is the\namount of errors in the articles, be it\ntypos, grammar etc. As the copy editors of the paper have lives, and can\u2019t\nstay late to read our section it is down\nto us to spot mistakes.\nQuite hard after going to the union\nthe day before the issue goes to print.\nTherefore we would like to call all\nthose interested in \u2018copy editing\u2019 the\nsports pages to drop us a line at sport.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk, or come and\nhave a chat whenever you see either\nof us around so we can sort something\nout. It\u2019s not that hard of a job, the baThe netball 1s hadn\u2019t won a game all\nseason and as they headed off to Catford to face Kings Medics they knew\nif they were going to change that then\nthis would be the night\u2026\nWaiting in the changing rooms for a\ncaretaker to be found to switch on the\nfloodlights spirits were high. Perhaps\na little too high and cocky though as\nwhen we eventually got on court over\nhalf an hour late the first quarter was a\ndisastrous affair. No matter how many\nbeautiful interceptions kept being\nmade in defence the ball was continuously lost as the girls tried to bring it\ndown court. This lack of flow through\nthe team has been a recurring problem all term due to inconsistencies in\nthe squad and was the main reason for\nour continued defeats. We lost the first\nfour centres in a row. Along with some\nshocking umpiring that saw attack repeatedly being contacted as they tried\nto take a shot but it never getting called\nup and defence being pulled up for distance at 6\u2019 odd this saw the first quarter\nend at 7-5 to GKT.\nIC took themselves to one side for\na team talk looking a bit dismal. Keen\neyed Team Captain Rachel Dilley however had other concerns. She felt the\nquarter hadn\u2019t seemed long enough\nso questioned the umpires. Having\nfound out we\u2019d only played 12 minutes\ninstead of the required 15 due to the\nlate start she insisted we be allowed to\nget back on and finish the remaining\n3 minutes because we hadn\u2019t been informed before play began. This saw us\nlose another goal so the score became\n8-5 to GKT. It also caused an argument between the GKT Captain and\nthe umpires, which resulted in the silly\ngirl crying and taking herself off for the\nrest of the game!?\nThe Imperial girls all knew what\nthey had to do. Concentration wasn\u2019t\nthere, the aggression and want of the\nwin wasn\u2019t there. We came back on for\nthe second quarter more determined\nknowing we were the better team and\nwe just needed to start playing at the\nlevel we were capable of.\nFrustration with the refereeing\nstarted to get to several players including GK Kate Chapman, who slammed\nthe ball on the floor after yet another\nridiculous call causing it to hit the\nbase of the post and almost knock one\nof the umpires in the face, and GA\nColette Gregory, whose shooting was\ncompletely off. Nevertheless, IC still\nmanaged to pull it back to 12 all at half\ntime.\nRachel asked her team if they actually wanted to win a game this season\nand instructed Colette to \u201cgive it some\u201d.\nComing back on for the third quarter\nis when it all went wrong for Kings. A\nmiscalculated substitution of their GA\nlet IC pull away and our confidence\nColette Gregory\nJack Cornish &\nMustapher Botchway\nSports Editors\nMerry\nChristmas!\nsic job-description is to read articles\nand check for grammatical mistakes. I\nshan\u2019t mention the fact you could put\nit on your CV if you are struggling on\nyour extra-curricular section.\nAnyhow enough harping on about\nthe goings on of the paper and onwards\nto the future.\nJack and I have devised some ideas\nfor the sports pages next year, which\nhopefully will see fruition. This includes possible comments columns\nfrom prominent people within the\nACC.\nExpect more debates and more opinion pieces from us, including a possible\nresurrection of the \u2018superclub\u2019 debate.\nThe final week of college has slightly\nreduced the number of games taking place this week but we still have a\nhearty five pages for you to digest including Jack\u2019s interview with Catherine\nAtkin.\nSquash are still ruling things by the\nway.\nHave a merry Christmas and whatever you do, keep fit and don\u2019t suffer\nfrom the Christmas dinner pile on.\nsoar leading to successive goals. Defence kept talking to each other and\nthe Chapman-Dilley-Davies combination totally dominated the opposition\u2019s\nattack. Carolyn Sharpe (despite suffering from a two-day hangover after the\nepic Netball Christmas Dinner!) and\nNicole Evans, at C and WA respective-ly, started to work the ball down better\nwith support from behind. A change\nof tactics in the goal third saw some\nsneaky elbows off ball from Colette to\nteach her GD a lesson and movement\nout of the D by the GS Sam Westrop\nto create more space for her GA meant\nthe balls kept going in. IC came off 21-15 ahead.\nThe question was: were the girls going to let it go in the last quarter like\nthey had in so many other games? Not\na chance. Some say the play in attack\nin the final quarter was \u201cpoetry in\nmotion\u201d, but they might be twats, for\nexample twat of the match in Rachel\nDilley. This award was given for accidentally pulling her pants down along\nwith her skort in the changing rooms\nafter the game. I think it might have\nbeen in anticipation of the centre-fold appearance! Player of the match\nwas Nicole who has boundless energy\nand is fully devoted to every game. IC\nplayer was Kate Chapman who had a\ngreat game right from the start making \u201clovely\u201d interception after \u201clovely\u201d\ninterception.\nThe final score was 35-19 to Imperial resulting in a group hug and girly\nwhoops of delight!! We\u2019ll be coming to\na page three near you very soon!!\nNetball\nNetball Women\u2019s 1st VII 39\nKing\u2019s Medicals 2nd VII 15\nLooks like there\u2019ll be a\nnetball centrefold!\n\n"

The first question was simply asking the students if they have felt\naffected where it was found that there\nwas a fairly even split between those\nwho did (48%) and those who didn\u2019t\n(52%).\nWhen looking at the results closer\nand examining each age group, a more\ninteresting correlation was found. Just\nover 2/3 of the students who said that\nthey didn\u2019t feel affected were in their\nfirst and second year. Some might hypothesize that this is due the fact that\nthe students have only just started living independently and have not been\nexposed to \u2018the real world\u2019 of bills and\nrent.\nIn an expected contrast, of the students that did say they felt affected by\nthe current economic climate, again\njust over 2/3 were in either their third\nor fourth year. These students have\nbeen living independently for several\nyears now and have seen the change in\nfood prices, bills as well as rent, with\nthe increased rent being linked the increase in house prices and the inability\nfor first time buyers to purchase their\nown house. One fourth year maths\nstudent said that the highest cost they\nhave seen rise over the past few years\nhave been with bill. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that\nmy weekly shop has steadily been getting more expensive and the bills increase from year to year\u201d, he told felix.\nEd Miliband, the new Energy Secretary for Labour, told an audience at the\nImperial College Energy Future Lab on\nTuesday that \u201cWe have recently seen\nbig falls in wholesale gas and electricity prices, but I understand that because energy companies tend to buy\nin advance they won\u2019t be passed on\nThe credit crunch\non a global scale\nU\nnknown to many, the\nfinancial meltdown\nhas been a long time\ncoming. Although the\nwidespread panic and\ndramatic decrease in confidence\nis a relatively new ordeal, the crux\nof the issue can be said to have began in 2001 with the bursting of the\ntechnology/dot com bubble and\nobviously, the traumatic events of\nSeptember 11th. While the succession of events was not necessarily\ndeemed to have such far-reaching\neffects, it happened hastily, covertly\nand mostly, outside the scrutiny of\npublic eye.\nAfter these events, the US decided to cut interest rates to levels not\nseen in a very long time, resulting\nin a higher than average demand for\nhouses all across the country, obviously leading to an increase in the\noverall prices for houses. In hind-sight, it would not be unfair to say\nthat this particular moment defined\nthe markets for the years that would\ncome. Given the booming housing\nmarket, a lot of starry-eyed mortgage\ncompanies saw a supposed opportunity to get their pie share\u2019s worth and\nstarted a highly irresponsible lending\nfrenzy. This included not performing the most basic of credit checks,\nlending to people with bad credit\nand on incomes that were too low to\ncover the repayments should interests increase on variable-rate mort-gages. This is what is now known as\nthe subprime market.\nWhen inflation began to reach\nlevels that worried the government,\nrates were hiked to 4% meaning that\npeople who took out gargantuan\nloans suddenly found themselves\nunable to make monthly repayment\nand defaults shot through the roof,\nleaving many mortgage providers\nseverely wounded due to their own\nirresponsibility and lack of regula-tion. The result was a sharp decline\nJovan Nedi\u0107 tries to understand the impact, if any, the credit crisis has had on the students at Imperial. felix\nsurvey 160 students in an attempt to find out. Don\u2019t worry, hopefully Christmas won\u2019t be ruined this year.\nimmediately.\u201d\n\u201cBut they must be passed on as soon\nas possible.\u201d\nIn his speech, Mr Miliband was criticising the fact that energy companies\nwill not be lowering their prices as\nthey will be frozen, with one spokesman for Centrica, which has 16 million\ncustomers in the UK, saying that they\n\u201ccannot now sell this gas at a loss... we\nwill have to wait.\u201d\nIn a recent survey carried out by\nZebra Technologies, it suggested that\nroughly 54% of students felt that the\ncurrent student discounts were not\ncatering their current needs (felix issue 1,410). A similar question was\nput forward to the students that took\npart in the felix survey, where an overwhelming 93% of students said that\nthey would prefer to see discounts on\nliving essentials, such as groceries,\nthan on luxury items such as clothes\nand music.\nThe British government, in an attempt to ease the economy, decided to\nreduce the standard rate of VAT from\n17.5% to 15% as of 1st December 2008\nuntil 1st January 2010. VAT, or value\nadded tax, is the tax added onto any\nitem that is bought, with several different levels of VAT, including zero rate\nVAT that is charged on food, books and\nnewspapers. Only luxury food items\nsuch as chocolate and drinks, such as\nalcohol and fizzy drinks are taxed at\nthe standard rate.\nThe Catering Department at Imperial College, and Imperial College Union\n[ICU] have both released statements\nexplaining the effect these changes will\nhave on the goods that they sell. In a\nstatement in last week\u2019s issue of felix,\nICU said that \u201cThe Union Shop and\nNewsagent have reduced their prices\nand although some of the marked up\nprices have not changed yet, the price\nin house prices at a time when construction was at an all time high,\ncreating a massive disparity in supply and demand. This meant that\nlenders had a tough time getting the\namounts of the loan back by selling\nthe repossessed house, hurting their\nfinancials further.\nIn order to lend money, mortgage\nproviders repackaged their debt in\ncomplex financial products which\nthey sold to supposedly responsible\nbanks, ensuring the ratings agency\ngave these vehicles very high ratings,\nfalsely deeming them suitable and\na worthwhile investment. Because\nthis debt was not to be paid back\nby the borrowers, the institutions\nthat bought this collaterised debt\nwere then faced with a problem of\nbad debt that needed to be written\noff their balance sheet substantially\nreducing their capital and hence\nthe amount available for day-to-day\nlending to other banks (the money\nmarket), creating what we now know\nas the credit crunch.\nBecause of the money being hemorrhaged by banks, selling and short-selling of their shares started happening en-masse ferociously driving\ntheir prices down. This led to one of\nthe biggest problems in an economy:\ndecrease of consumer confidence.\nGiven the irresponsible lending of\nthe past combined with less available capital, institutions are now unable to lend as much, resulting in a\ndecrease in demand for houses further driving the downward spiral of\nprices.\nIt would be foolish to say that only\nbig financial corporations are affected by these unfortunate events.\nInvestment on the part of companies\nhas taken a downturn and consumer\nspending has dramatically slowed\ndown putting a lot of strain on the\neconomy that is likely to lead to further unemployment and even more\nlosses in the financial markets.\nStudents are not immune to this\ncrisis that is pointing more clearly\neach day to a global recession.\nyou will actually pay at the till has been\nreduced accordingly.\u201d\n\u201cThe Union Catering\u2019s prices will not\nchange as VAT is not applicable to our\nfood sales.\u201d\n\u201cThe Union Bars\u2019 prices will remain\nunchanged due to the rise in the duty\non alcohol cancelling out any change\nin prices that may be passed on to the\nUnion by our suppliers.\u201d\nIn a similar statement sent to felix,\nthe Catering Department said, \u201cAs\nyou are aware selling prices have not\nchanged since 1 December and a complete analysis of the first week\u2019s sales\nhas been undertaken.\u201d For some time\nnow there has been a different pricing structure in College, with students\nnot paying VAT on some items and an\nagreement with HR Customs and Excise meant that they could only reclaim\nsome rather than all of the VAT. The\nCatering Department went on to say\nthat \u201cFor this reason on a transaction\nbasis the implications of the VAT decrease are negligible (for example, 0.3p\nfor a Mars Bar) and it is therefore inappropriate to adjust prices.\u201d\nThey had calculated that, over the\npast week, figures show that the College profited by maintaining the published prices to the tune of \u00a3796 from\nstaff transactions and \u00a3151 from student transactions. Since the College\nCatering Department is \u201crun for the\nbenefit of the students and staff of the\nCollege on a not for profit basis\u201d and\nas such they have decided to reduce\nthe cost of dinners in the Senior Common Room [SCR] by 25p and have also\ndecided to donate \u00a32,000 to the 2009\nSummer Ball.\nThere are also plans from ICU to improve the services offered in the bars,\nwith the main plan being to revue the\ndrinks that are on offer. These changes\nare likely to occur in the New Year.\nThe effect the crunch has\nhad at Imperial\nA\nnew Imperial brand\nhas started to appear\nover the whole cam-pus, Taste Imperial.\nThis new unified catering service on campus is there\nfor the students and staff at Imperial\nand has taken control of all outlets,\nincluding vending machines. Many\nfound this change a surprise to say\nthe least as in some cases, all that\nwas left on certain vending machines\nwas a simple notice, as can be seen in\nthe image on the right.\nWith the new unification on cam-pus, which includes the removal of\nnine vending machines, the main\nfear from students was that there\nwould be an increase in costs. This\nwas the case and now there is a set\nprice across campus. The College\nalso reimbursed the departments\nthat may have incurred any financial\nloss over the new unification.\nThe main problem that remained\nwas the increase in prices, with some\nitems, such as coffee, doubling in\nprice in certain departments. However it is not only the College that\nhas been changing its prices. At the\nstart of this year, as well as bringing\nin a whole new range of drinks, Imperial College Union [ICU] decided\nto increase their prices by 10% per\npint. On the other hand, they have\nrecently managed to create a Christmas menu for less than \u00a35 a head\nfor three courses. This increase in the\nprice of goods, as is the case in all retail\noutlets, is partly due to the state of the\neconomy.\nAs expected, the results of the survey showed that the first year students\nhadn\u2019t even realised that there was a\nchange in price, but when told about\nwhat they thought about the prices of\nitems, they said that the prices \u201cweren\u2019t\ntoo bad\u201d and that \u201cchocolates and fizzy\ndrinks are cheaper, if not the same at\nsome other places.\u201d This rather expected result could be explained by\nthe sheer fact that this is their first year\nhere so it is not possible to observe a\nchange in the prices.\nIn contrast, the second year students that were surveyed did realise\nthat there was a difference in prices,\nwith approximately 2/3 of students\nasked thinking that the increase in\nprices were not good. The proportion\nof students having negative feelings towards the change increase in the third\nand fourth years as students had been\naround for longer.\nMany of the older students had\nsome string views about the increase\nin prices across the campus. One 3rd\nyear Biology student told felix that she\nfelt that \u201cthe increase in prices was not\nwarranted as there was not an equal\nincrease in quality.\u201d Another 3rd year\nstudent, from the Materials depart-ment, said that there was simply \u201cno\nneed!\u201d He then followed on by saying\nthat \u201cthe Sandwich Shop has barely\nput up its prices and they are the main\ncompetitors.\u201d\nPaddy Jackman, Director of Commercial Services at Imperial College,\nwhen hearing of the results, told felix that \u201cthese were the first rises in\n2 years, indeed some prices were reduced at the beginning of the 2007-08\nacademic year, and reflected the sharp\nincreases seen in the price of the vast\nmajority of food products in the early\npart of 2008. The Commercial Services\ndepartment recognises the constraints\nthat the vast majority of students have\non their budgets and seeks to provide a\nservice to students and staff that merely covers its costs.\u201d\n\u201cWe competitively shop against\nother universities and the high street\non a constant basis to ensure that we\nprovide a value for money service and\nour surveys indicate that we compare\nfavourably against other academic in-stitutions. We do try to offer additional\n\u201c74% of 2nd,\n3rd & 4th year\nstudents thought\nthe prices changes\nwere bad\u201d\nvalue through \u2018meal deals\u2019 and by\nclosely liaising with suppliers to ensure\nthat we get the benefit of any promotions they are running.\u201d\nClearly the effects of the crunch have\nreached our own student shores, and\nalthough many students are unhappy\nabout the change in prices, it seems,\nat least for now, there is not much\nthat can be done to alleviate the apparent burden that the students currently feel students.\nEmployment possibilities\nT\nhe current state of the\neconomy has also meant\nthat many jobs are at risk,\nespecially in the financial\nsector. In the past year\n1.9 million jobs have been lost in the\nUS alone and the number is expected\nto rise. Over the past couple of years,\nthe majority of Imperial graduates\nhave gone into the banking and financial sector, closely followed by \u2018other\nbusiness activities\u2019 as stated on the\nCollege\u2019s Careers website. More traditional employment opportunities for\nImperial graduates, such as engineer-ing, science and mining, have slowly\nseen a drop off in numbers.\nThese jobs now appear to be more\nsecure, with a recent survey by Monster.com suggesting that \u201cthe workers most in demand, even in a down\neconomy are those who excel in the\nlogical and mathematical skills.\u201d To\nmirror the expected decline in jobs\nin the financial sector, RBS told The\nEdinburgh Journal that \u201cas a result of\nthe current climate, we will be taking\non fewer graduates in 2009.\u201d In contrast to the statement made by RBS,\na HSBC spokesman said that: \u201cIn the\nretail and commercial banking, our\nstrategy in recruiting graduates is to\ntake into account our expected middle\nmanagement and senior management\nvacancies six to eight years after the\ngraduate completes their development\nprogramme.\u201d\nfelix has been made aware that there\nare several recent Imperial graduates\nwho have been affected directly by the\ncredit crunch, with many being made\nredundant after just 5 months of work.\nTo make matters worse for graduates,\nthe Student Loans Company has decided to change its rate of interest from\n2.4% to 4.8% and is currently set at 3%,\nmeaning students will have more to\npay off.\nIn the survey carried out by felix,\nwe asked the students if they were\nworried about employment after they\nfinish their degree. Rather unsurpris-ingly, 95% of first and second years\nstudents said that they were not wor-ried, with the main reason being that\nthey felt the economy would stabilise\nby the time they finish. The results\nfrom the third and fourth year students\nshowed a mixed bag of results. Of the\n80 students asked between the two\nyear groups, 69% said they were worried about the job, with the majority\nof them initially looking for jobs in the\nfinancial sector. Of the students who\nwere not worried, the main reason final year students gave (this includes\nthose on a three year course) was that\nthey had already secured a job with the\nmajority going to work in the science\nand engineering sector. 16% of third\nand fourth year students also said that\nthey will be carrying on their studies in\nthe hope to weather the storm.\nThe fact is that there are still jobs\navailable for graduates although these\nmight not be in the financial sector.\nAnd those who have worked in the finance sector have found other opportunities available to them. Below are\nsome case studies.\nCASE STUDY 1\nDegree: 1st Materials 2004\nJob: Consultant at Accenture\nOutcome: Took voluntary redundancy\nand has used the money to travel for a\nfew months before starting a new job\nin America.\nCASE STUDY 2\nDegree: 2.1 Chemistry 2005\nJob: BarCap Investment Banking\nOutcome:Convertedtoteachingscience\nafter working in The City for 3 years\nCASE STUDY 3\nDegree: 2.1 Mech Eng 2008\nJob: Dresdner\nOutcome: Position up for review with\nthe most likely outcome being redun-dancy.

As\nalways, both the Wellcome Collection and the exhibition are\ncompletely free to get into. While I am\nan enthusiastic supporter of the Wellcome Collection, I go in suspecting I\nam not going to like this exhibition. It\u2019s\ngoing to be depressing and gory. I can\nfeel amputations and post traumatic\nstress disorder coming on. I\u2019m going to\ncome out of it miserable.\nThe atmosphere once you step\nthrough the big glass doors is quiet\nand sinister, with distant clunking and\nwhirring sounds. I\u2019m drawn to the hum\nof a darkened room to my left where a\nfilm is being shown. This is \u2018Theatre\u2019\nby David Cotterrel, whose films also\nappear later in the exhibition. It\u2019s a\ncontinuous 60 minutes of panoramic\nfootage aboard a hollow military air-craft, where army medics tend to an\nunconscious wounded soldier strapped\nto a stretcher. I watch for 10 minutes\nor so, during which time nothing hap-pens, aside from a medic standing up\nand sitting down. I keep waiting for\nsomething unexpected and dramatic\nto happen, but it never does. It\u2019s oddly\nchilling, setting the mood for the rest\nof the exhibit.\nAn early criticism I have is that\n\u2018War and Medicine\u2019 is a little jumbly.\nIt bounces from triage to nutrition to\ntransport to disease prevention... all\nwhile also jumping between wars. You\nhave to pay some attention to whether\nyou\u2019re looking at an artefact from the\nFirst World War or the Gulf Wars. It\nencompasses the history of war from\nthe Crimea to modern conflicts in\nIraq and Afghanistan, with the world\nwars in between, though with little\nin between these major focuses. The\ncontent is an interesting, attention-holding mix of objects, painting, photographs and posters. A neat label\nexplains each item \u2013 major brownie\npoints here. While the order can feel\nirratic, the individual narrative of each\npiece is clear. Everyday medical equipment demands attention, and you can\u2019t\nhelp but admire the aesthetics of such\nthings as artificial limbs, first aid kits\nand syringes. One of the greatest accomplishments of the Wellcome Collection is the transformation of humble objects into art.\nContrary to my expectations, there is\nno blatant blood and gore. It\u2019s all very\ncivilised and tidy. However, the section on facial reconstruction is fairly\nhorrendous, with photographs and\npaintings of men barely recognisable\nas human. Holes in their faces, noses\nmissing, warped eyes, burning and\nblistering... and all of them after their\nreconstruction. But they\u2019re not here to\nshock us \u2013 the way they\u2019re respectfully\nportrayed means it\u2019s more saddening\nthan anything else.\nOne idea the exhibition puts forward\nis that a positive impact of war is the\nmedical advancement it brings. We\nhave war to thank for blood transfu-sions, penicillin, X-rays and so many\nother life saving technologies. This is\na thought-provoking realisation. But\nthe flipside to this is the use of war to\nDoesn\u2019t it look lovely and shiny, children? Don\u2019t step under the lights or you\u2019ll get beamed up\njustify the horrific, notably the experiments carried out by scientists of the\nNazi regime on human beings in concentration camps during the Second\nWorld War. A hall of shame of Nazis\nconvicted of such atrocities displays\ntheir personal defences and justifi-cations, which are chilling. I have to\nskim over much of the section on shell\nshock, with videos from military hospitals of men shaking and rocking back\nand forth as cold-hearted doctors look\non.\nI\u2019d advise anybody interested in going to check out Wellcome\u2019s calendar\nof events, which includes tours round\nthe exhibition. When I was half way\nthrough, a perspectives tour by an expert on the history of medicine kicked\noff. Had I known about this I would\ndefinitely have signed up. It sounded\nfascinating. Such a tour would probably succeed in revealing running\nthemes difficult to pick out on your\nown. All are, of course, free.\nAs expected, Wellcome portray\nwar in a satisfyingly neutral way.\nThey don\u2019t glorify it, but don\u2019t openly\ncriticise it. They offer wounded and\nscarred soldiers respectful recogni-tion, while also portraying conflict as\na catalyst for medical progress. At no\npoint is the short and concise exhibition preachy or out to shock. I very\nmuch like how factual information is\npresented in an art gallery style and\nsetting. The Wellcome Collection do\nsomething not done anywhere else,\nwhich is always admirable. Don\u2019t go to\n\u2018War and Medicine\u2019 if you\u2019re looking\nfor something fun and uplifting. This it\ncertainly is not. Go to \u2018War and Medicine\u2019 if you want to see a brilliantly put-together exhibition that will challenge\nyour pre-conceptions, and leave you\nbetter informed and with a head full of\nthoughts.\nWar and Medicine\nAt the Wellcome Collection until\n15th February 2009. Entry is free!\nLucy Harrold previewed Imagine This a few weeks ago, but does the real deal match up to expectations?\nWar is bad, but medicine is good...?\nPreview done, here\u2019s the review\nA\nfter having my sneak\npeak of Imagine This a\nfew weeks ago I was eager to see what the rest of\nthe show had in store and\nso off I trekked to the New London, despite feeling like death warmed up, to\nfind out. The New London theatre itself isn\u2019t pretty; it was built in seventies\nwhen concrete was the architect\u2019s best\nfriend and escalators were state of the\nart. They\u2019ve tried to make the best of\nthe interior with displays and posters\ndotted around the vast lobby and bar\narea. Unfortunately the toilets couldn\u2019t\nbe improved. I was slightly dismayed to\nfind so many empty seats on only the\nsecond night with at least eight just in\nour row. The main demographic appeared to be elder theatregoers who\nhave had enough of showy yet shallow\nmusicals and wanted to try something\nnew.\nThe show started with a plunge into\ndarkness; luckily we were ready for it as\nmy companion and I were saying how\nthe show should be starting just about...\nshit why is dark?! We were transported\nback to pre-war Poland where everyone wears their Sunday best and rides\non Merry-Go-Rounds only to be cruelly pulled out of this dream by a bunch\nof Nazis thus signalling the creation of\nthe Warsaw Ghetto. Thus the writers\nmanage to cram four years of history\nand most of the exposition in one song\nwithout making it feel rushed or on\npurpose. The rest of the action takes\nplace in Eugene Lee\u2019s vast set: a disused train depot and the space outside\nit. The space has such depth - it really\ndoes feel like a cold damp building that\ncould easily fall down with realistic\nsnow falling outside (my friend loves\nsnow so she was rather excited by this).\nEven if I didn\u2019t love theatre I would go\njust to see that set.\nI gave the basic plot to Imagine This\nin the preview article that I hope you\nall read and took note of (please say\nyes). I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil what\nturned out to be a rather gripping and\ntense plot that I wasn\u2019t expecting. In a\nnutshell Imagine This tells the story of\nDaniel Warshowsky, his family and his\nacting company putting on a production of Masada for those trapped in the\nWarsaw Ghetto. The tale of Masada\nreflects and ultimately influences the\nfamily\u2019s own story and is entwined with\nsecret love affairs. From what I\u2019d heard,\nI imagined the plot would be juvenile\nand embarrassing but, on the whole, I\nwas happily mistaken. It had sufficient\nplot twists to keep you guessing but\ndidn\u2019t require too much thought on\nthe audience\u2019s behalf, which I believe\nwould have detracted from the visual\nspectacle and the music. I was also\nconcerned that the Jewish mythology\nwould go over my head but, although\nit could have been a little clearer, most\nof the story of Masada was given in the\nexposition.\nOne review, although not entirely\npositive, decided that the Imagine\nThis cast is one of the most hardworking casts on the West End and I\nmust agree. To go through the trial of\nbeing ripped out of normal life and\nultimately deciding whether you live\nbut allow hundreds of others to perish or sacrifice yourself to save those\nothers must be exhausting. Yet the\ncast pull it off with ease and still have\ntime to have a song and dance about\nit. Peter Polycarpou was awesome as\nalways, his voice is so crisp and clear\nyet booming and his acting commanding yet loving. Leila Benn-Harris is\nsurely a name to watch out for in the\nfuture. Her portrayal of Rebecca (and\nTamar, the character she plays in Masada) was heartbreaking both through\nher acting and her amazing, distinctive\nvoice. I was also impressed by Simon\nGleeson as resistance fighter Adam\n(General Silva in Masada). He and\nBenn-Harris had a genuine connection that could be seen in their duets\nand romantic moments. The production team have really got together an\namazing bunch of performers - there\u2019s\nno real weak link. I wasn\u2019t too taken by\nNathan Attard, who played Leon (the\nsmall child), but I think this is because\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of child performers\nin theatre generally.\nI guess I should mention the mu-sic. Imagine This really takes musical\ntheatre back to the \u2018good old days\u2019 of\nfull chorus and large orchestral scores.\nAlmost everything the chorus sings is\nin harmony thus creating a lush, rich\nsound and making this writer very happy - she\u2019s a sucker for a good harmony!\nThere were many moments where I\nsat mouth wide open thinking \u201chow\ndid that sound just come out of that\nsmall cast?\u201d. My particular favourites\nwere the title song Imagine This and\nMasada, the battle song I had seen the\ncast rehearsing previously. Both could\neasily have been amazing finale pieces\nso it seemed strange that act one ended\nwith a soaring love song rudely cut off\nby the Nazis. I liked this break from the\nnorm. It really made the audience feel\nvulnerable and part of the action. It is\nlittle additions like the breaking of the\nfourth wall that make Imagine This an\nintelligent piece aimed at people who\ndon\u2019t just want fun and frolics at the\ntheatre but want to search for something deeper.\nTimothy Sheader\u2019s direction has left\nme in two minds; some of his work was\nabsolute genius. The way he took advantage of the revolve really impressed\nme on a visual level as did much of\nhis staging and on an emotional level\nI left the theatre almost in tears. I really felt for those characters. But some\nother parts of the staging just looked\nmessy and all over the place in particular dance numbers tended to have\ndifferent people doing different moves.\nNormally this would look \u2018cool and\nedgy\u2019 but it just looked like the actors\nhadn\u2019t quite learnt the dance yet. It appeared that Sheader felt he had to have\nsomeone on each part of the stage at\nall times making it difficult to focus on\na particular character, often I couldn\u2019t\nsee who was singing what.\nTo me the first act paled in comparison to the second act, for the last half\nhour of the show I didn\u2019t move from\nmy seat, transfixed by the tale unfolding in front of me. But the first act\ntook a while to get going. There was an\nuncomfortably long scene of dialogue\nbetween the company and the Nazis\nwhere they attempted to joke with the\nNazis. I felt uneasy as to whether this\nwould really have occurred or whether\nthe Nazi officer would have just shot\nthem all. Comedy is the main failing of\nthe show, especially with the character\nof Izzy/Pompey, a clown from Berlin.\nPompey was given an unusually long\ncomedy song in act one which just\nwasn\u2019t funny and took the audience out\nof the chilling atmosphere the actors\nhad worked so hard to create. I also felt\nthat the characters\u2019 backgrounds could\nhave been developed further. I was glad\nto have read the online synopsis just so\nI knew who was who.\nOverall I think Imagine This is something different that we haven\u2019t seen in\nthe West End for a while; a serious musical that\u2019s not trying to be pretentious\nor high and mighty. Everything seems\ngenuine and has a big heart. I laughed\n(although some of the jokes just didn\u2019t\nland with me), I (nearly) cried and I felt\nfor that group of characters - something that hasn\u2019t happened to me in a\ntheatre for a while. I sent a friend to see\nit last week and he spent the next afternoon frantically trying to phone me to\ntell me how amazing the show was!\nIn the current economic climate I\u2019m\nnot sure if Imagine This will last that\nlong, I really hope it does but just to\nbe sure go see it now! Luckily for us\nstudents not only is the theatre so vast\nthat the cheap seats further back give a\nbetter sightline but if you go on the day\nyour shiny student card will get you an\nawesome seat for \u00a317.50.\nImagine This\nAt the New London Theatre, tickets available now!\nHopefully nobody will notice that I stole the images from the preview to use in the review... whoops, spilled\nthe beans! But you noticed, right? You\u2019re a bright bunch, and who could forget this chap and his sexy hat?\nHere we have a lovey dovey couple looking all happy. Too bad the\nNazis are on their way to ruin things by, y\u2019know, killing everybody\nYes yes, you should have got the message by now. Imagine This.\nMusical. Bittersweet tragedy. Very good. Go see it now\nYou\u2019ll be glad to know that if you go to war and get a chunk of your\nface blasted off, you can get a chunk of tin to cover it up\nMoral of the exhibition: if you go to war, you will need medicine. Got that? Here is an image from one of\nDavid Cotterrel\u2019s films, which you can see at the Wellcome Collection exhibition \u2018War and Medicine\u2019\nAdvice all of us should live by: keep straight, keep sober, guard against\nVD. And they didn\u2019t even have SHAG week back in the 1940s...\n\n"

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 12 December 2008 felix\nArts\nHistorical delights from Babylon\nEmilie Beauchamp delves into all that Babylon has to offer in the British Museum\ngardens, the tower of Babel, the Belshazzar\u2019s Feast and others.\nThese stories come from the Bible\u2019s\nGenesis or from accounts of Greek\nphilosophers such as Herodotus, and\noften contradict the historical evidence\nfound by archaeologists. Indeed, there\nhas been up to now no artefact proving\nthe existence of the hanging gardens...\nHowever, the famous tower of Babel\nis known to portray the Etemenanki\nziggurat, the main temple of Babylon,\nwhich was used to worship the warrior\ngod Marduk. Many historians believe\nthat it was Babylon\u2019s desire to conquer\ntoo much territory, and its subsequent\noverstretch, that led to its fall. The\nmyth of the tower of Babel parallels\nthat story. In biblical accounts, Babel\nwas a city that tried to unite humanity and which was punished by God to\nhave been foolish and greedy. Babylon\nwas too much of an expansionary city-state and one of its greatest battles was\nthe capture of Jerusalem, after which\nthousands of Jews were forced to migrate to Babylon to serve as forced\nlabour. So goes the famous song \u201cBy\nthe Rivers of Babylon\u201d, signing the lament of Jews missing their native Zion.\nMany other legends such as these are\ndepicted in the exhibition, some of\nwhich still have significance today. The\nBritish Museum pictures the rationale\nbehind the legendary accounts of Babylon, disentangling the truth from the\ntales, and offers pieces of art that have\nbeen inspired by these to complement\nits explanations. Most of the pieces\ndisplayed are interesting, but some are\nweaker in their stance and one wonders if some of the interest stems from\ntheir intrinsic value or rather because\nthe topic of Babylon itself never fails to\ncaptivate.\nFurther on, the exhibition does a\ngood job at portraying the real Babylon. Here, rare artefacts from the British Museum, the Pergamon Museum\nin Berlin and the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in\nParis are rallied. From the architectural\ndetails of the most famous buildings in\nBabylon, to the presentation of a piece\nof the monumental Ishtar Gate, which\ntriumphed at the end of the royal procession path, the exhibition puts forward evidence which makes it almost\npossible to imagine the city standing\nI\n\u2019d wish you all a Merry Christmas, but I\u2019m feeling a little bah\nhumbug right now. I\u2019ve got a\nspectacular cold, complete with\nfever, shivering, hacking cough,\nphlegm\u2026 all this and a sore red nose\nRudolph would be envious of. I\u2019m desperately hoping it\u2019ll have cleared up by\nthe time you read this.\nIn the meantime I\u2019m armed with\nenough cold and flu remedies to open\nup my own branch of Boots. I spent a\nbewildered twenty minutes in a pharmacy trying to evaluate whether my\ncough was \u201ctickly\u201d, \u201cdry\u201d or \u201cchesty\u201d. I\nopted for chesty on the basis that the\nactive drug had a more chemically-sounding name.\nFor the record, Boots brand \u201csore\nthroat relief dual action lozenges\u201d are\nhalf the price of Strepsils Extra, but\nalso taste half as tolerable. In addition,\nI\u2019d like to offer a special shout-out to\nwhoever manufactures pocket packs\nof tissues infused with Olbas oil, because they are now my best friends.\nThey make your entire face tingle with\nmenthol-y goodness.\nThis is generally not the state one\nwants to be in at a job interview, which\nis where I found myself this morning.\nYou\u2019ll be glad to hear I survived without exploding with snot all over any\nexecutives. It did make the numerical test extra painful though. I won\u2019t\ncomment on how I think the interview\nwent, given that when this gets printed\nI\u2019ll have heard back (and, let\u2019s face it,\nprobably have been brutally rejected).\nEmily Wilson\nArts Editor\nEverybody knows that the main thing\nabout job interviews is that you must\nconsume as much free stuff as possible.\nToday\u2019s won bonus points by providing free coffee and biscuits. The best I\never had involved a three-course lunch\nat Strada for all candidates \u2013 woohoo!\nThat definitely softened the blow of\nrejection.\nAside from this, I\u2019m getting a little\npissed off with employment opportu-nities, or lack thereof. Goddamn economic crisis! I need a job so I won\u2019t\nhave to live in a cardboard box next\nyear!\nNo longer does going to a fine institute of learning like Imperial College\nguarantee you a cushy job in the city.\nNow you have to bow before the corporations and beg. The general competitiveness is soul-destroying. One\ninterview I went to recently, featured\nme and a bunch of bright young things\nwho\u2019d all had graduate positions at Lehman Brothers, and post-collapse had\nbeen bulking out their already-impres-sive CVs with charity work. Bastards.\nIn case you\u2019re wondering how this is\nrelated to arts and culture\u2026 it isn\u2019t. I\ncould talk about what\u2019s happening in\nthe arty farty world at the moment, but\nI don\u2019t actually know. I would hazard\na guess that Damien Hirst is making\nmore money in some way, but don\u2019t\nquote me on that.\nAs always, you can get free tickets\nfrom us for pretty much anything artsy\nthat you feel like seeing. Send us an\nemail and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\nJust call me\nScrooge\ntoday.\nThe British Museum also does not\nfail to provide a follow-up of the city\ntoday. All that remains from the grand\nBabylon, located approximately 55 kilometres from Bagdad in Iraq, is a pile\nof mud bricks scattered here and there\naround its old perimeter. Victim of its\nown success, the debris of the city have\nbeen stolen by neighbouring colonies\nover centuries as the enduring high\nquality of the bricks and materials used\nmake them valuable for looters.\nThe fall of babylon seems to continue\nover the age and carries on even today.\nTo the world\u2019s dismay, Saddam Hussein constructed in 1985 new buildings on top of the old ruins, destroying\narchaeological evidence. In this enter-prise, he even declared himself the son\nof Nebuchadnezzar II! Moreover, since\nthe invasion of Iraq by the Americans,\nthe situation... has only got worse! The\nUS military actually built an army\ncamp on Babylon\u2019s site and even built\na helipad on some of its ruins. In short,\nmost of the remaining archaeological artefacts of Babylon have probably\nbeen destroyed by now...\nThe British Museum therefore offers\na great chance to discover that famed\ncity and learn about its stories, even if\nthe exhibition is rather short and very\nbusy at any time of the day (you have to\nbook in advance if you do not want to\nwait an hour to get in)! But in any ways,\nBabylon will always be fascinating.\nBabylon: Myth and Reality\nAt the British Museum until 15th\nMarch 2009\nIt\u2019s all sex and drugs, as usual...\nCaz Knight goes to the Institute of Contemporary Arts and has the rare opportunity to write a bad review\nI\nreaped much from my trip to\nICA\u2019s Dispersion. It led me to a\nfew conclusions regarding how\nart is presented and the subsequent way in which the consumer digests it. It also gave me the opportunity to write my first bad review\nthus living up to my role as a critic, a\ncriticiser of art. Never having been to\nthe Institute for Contemporary Arts\nbefore, I was delighted by, as its name\nwould suggest, its interior modernity\nset in a neo-classical building, nestled\njust off Pall Mall in all its old money\ngrandeur. ICA combines gallery spaces\nwith a cinema, a theatre, a bar and a\ngeneral artsy yet down to earth vibe,\nquenching any and every sort of cultural thirst that might assail you.\nGiven that Dispersion is featured as\na must-see in more than just a few arts\nsectionsin-the-know,Iwasamazedand\nslightly appalled that it received such\nacclaim. Perhaps the fact that Mark\nLeckey, recent winner of the Turner\nPrize, is a contributor prompted such\npraise. (Leckey gives his \u2018lecture\u2019, a live\nperformance if his art, at ICA\u2019s theatre\nin January.)\nThe exhibition is spread across\nthree loci within ICA, making viewing a bit disjointed especially when the\nlast third must be reached following a\ntrawl through the bar (maybe not a bad\nthing?). Indeed, it lives up to its name.\nMaria Eichhorn, one of the seven artists which make up Dispersion, has\nconstructed a Film Lexicon of Sexual\nPractices, which is made interactive\nwith viewers at liberty to ask the projectionist to show any of the sixteen 3\nminute films: Ear-licking or Cunnilingus? Sex food play or Carezza? (That is\nprolonged sex minus the orgasm). The\nnovelty of getting to chose the film you\nwant is outweighed by them not having any of the good ones, and by the\nfact that the film was but a tiny square\non the white wall. Of course, 3 minutes of ear-licking, achieved the artist\u2019s\ndesired affect of making clinical and\nabstract these sexual practices, but at\nthe price of an anti-climax\u2026. instilling\nsome quasi-carezza in us, maybe.\nA slap dash collage of various gay\nand lesbian artists of the early last\ncentury, with an equally half hearted\nname, some gay and lesbian artist and/\nor artists relevant to homo-social cul-ture, would have disappointed a low\nachieving GCSE art student. However,\nthe work did introduce some post card\nexamples of the beautiful work of featured artists such as Jean-Frederic Bazille.Nevertheless,likeEichhorn\u2019swork\nbefore him, Olesen\u2019s piece is in keeping with the theme of the exhibition.\nAs far as I could make out from the\nwordy and indecipherable leaflet that\ncame with the exhibition, the artists\nare exploring the notion that identities\nare not given, but made by how they\nare represented. If this is true then it\nshould be possible to achieve what the\ncurator referred to as a \u2018critical\u2019 image.\nUsing found images - that is anything\navailable on the web and beyond - as\ntheir raw materials, they de-construct\nand then re-construct these images to\nproduce works that will comment on\nthe way in which they are presented\nto us in this age of relentless media.\nEach artist makes clear and interesting\npoints, but at the expense of aesthetic\nexperience.\nAll is not lost, the photograph of a\nfolded movie still featuring Jack Nicholson as McMurphy in One Flew\nOver the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, reminds us of\nhis youthful good looks. But best of all\nwas Hito Steyerl\u2019s documentary about\nher quest to find a young \u201cprot\u00e9g\u00e9\u201d, a\ncontemporary version of herself as she\nwas in her bondage model heyday of\n1987. The accompanying New Wave\nsoundtrack and retro Spider-women\nexcerpts made me stay and watch for\nthe whole length: possibly Dispersion\u2019s\nsaving grace.\nA lot of effort was expended reading\nthe supposed explanation and trying to\nrelate it to the subject matter. Try as I\nmight I could not find any of the alleged\nmeaning in a lot of the pieces, perhaps\nthere was none to be found. Not that\nart needs to even to serve a purpose or\nexpound a truth or message, although\nthe contrived bull shit in the booklet\nwould suggest otherwise.\nDespite what might be considered a\nharsh review, a quick walk round this\n(free!) exhibition will introduce you to\nanother very beautiful and different\nvenue and, who knows, what might be\none of your favourite artists. If worst\ncomes to worst there are always cock-tails. I will definitely be going back for\nthe Heroin and Cocaine salt and pepper shakers in the gift shop.\nDispersion is on at the Institute\nof Contemporary Arts until 1st\nFebruary 2009\nT\nhe British Museum already offers an incredible\namount of history to discover in its regular halls,\nbut also presents special\nexhibitions upon singular topics rallying artefacts from museums from all\nover the world. Until the March 15th, a\nunique presentation is showing on the\nlegendary Babylon, exploring the contrasts between the ancient metropolis\nfull of myths, and its modern representation discovered through archaeological evidence.\nBabylon started as a small town located in the fertile Mesopotamian\nplains near the third millennium B.C.\nand evolved through centuries as a\nfamed city-stated ruling over ancient\nSyria and more. It was the king Nebuchadnezzar II who brought Babylon\nto the peak of its glory, from 605 to\n562 B.C., mostly by further expanding\nits influence in Jerusalem and Egypt,\nbut also by reconstructing the city and\nmaking it one of the wonders of the ancient world. The exhibition therefore\nfocuses on the Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar II and its stories: the hanging\nThis apparently is a map of the world. On a rock. Impressive, huh? Felix Arts is so full of sex we\u2019re getting a little sick of it. It was this nipple or ear-licking or cunnilingus...\nThis image is entitled \u201cFelix gets broadcasted\u201d - so how could I not print the little guy?\nThis is a picture of Nebuchadnezzar by William Blake. Once I figured out to spell Nebuchadnezzar I\nWikipedia\u2019d him, and apparently he was a Babylonian king. Or a ship in The Matrix. So there you go\n\n"
