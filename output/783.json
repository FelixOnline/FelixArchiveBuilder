The street\ncollections are to\nsupport charities\nthat will not benefit\ndirectly from the\nmoney collected\nand put in IC Rag\ncoffers. Any money\nwhich is raised\nduring Rag Week\nwill be distributed\namong five national\ncharities which\nwere chosen by the\nRag Committee last\nterm.\nThe British Institute for Brain\nInjured Children (BIBIC)\nBIBIC was founded in 1972 and now\noperates from Knowle Hall near\nBridgewater in Somerset. BIBIC\nhelps children who have been\ndiagnosed as spastic, autistic,\nretarded, mentally handicapped,\nbackward, cerebral pals ie ld, mongoloid, slow, educationally\nsubnormal, epileptic or dyslexic.\nThese problems may stem from a brain injury which occured before or\nduring birth, through virus infection\nor vaccine damage, or as a result of\nan accident at home, on the road, or\nat play. BIBIC's goal is to improve\nthe quality of life of all their brain\ninjured children. To this end, they\naim for the day when they will\nfunction in every respect at the same\nlevel as their peers, and be able to\nsurvive independently in \u2022 the real\nworld.\nIt should be noted that after the age\nof about twelve the brain cells that are\ncontinually dying are no longer being\nreplaced, in this respect we are all\nbrain injured, it's just the extent of\ninjury that is different.\nThe Muscular Dystrophy Group of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland\nMuscular Dystrophy causes\nprogressive muscle wasting, and in its\nworst form leads to an almost total\nloss of voluntary movement. The\nMuscular Dystrophy group raises\nmoney to finance medical research\ninto the cause, treatment and cure for\nthe many forms of Muscular Dystrophy and allied neuromuscular\ndiseases. It also provides support to\nall those who are affected by these\ndiseases.\nQuest for a Test for Cancer\nQuest's research into early cancer\ndetection includes work at the Galton\nLaboratory which is part of\nUniversity College here in London.\nResearch is currently being conducted\ninto screening methods to detect\ngenetic predisposition to cancer. The\ncancers being studied include colon,\nthyroid and test cula r, some of which\ncan also affect children.\nShelter\nShelter is a charity that aims to help\nLondon's homeless, a problem that is\nincreasing at a rapid rate, especially\namong young adults. IC Rag's support of Shelter has been chosen to\ncoincide with National Homeless\nYear which begins in January.\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust is an\norganisation that gives advice and\ncou ncel ling to anyone, not just\nsufferers, about AIDS.

Initially set in the 50s the story\nstarts with Mike Shea (Timothy\nHutton) having a bad day. Having lost\nhis job and his girlfriend (who ran off\nto marry someone else), Mike sets off\nfor California to find happiness.\nBarely a hundred miles out of town,\nhe comes across a car accident and\nafter bravely saving a mother and her\ntwo children, he is unfortunately\ndrowned.\nHeaven, it turns out, is a great place\nto be. A late aunt of Mike's welcomes\nhim to paradise since the man in\ncharge is busy. Here he accidentally\nmeets Annie (Kelly McGillis) and\nthey fall in love. Everyone in Heaven\nis waiting to be born and soon Annie\ndisappears to be born on Earth.\nReluctant to wait his turn, Mike\nLive\nJohnny Mars Blues Band\nJohnny Mars and his band are\ncurrently playing the best blues to be\nheard on the pub and club scene since\nthe heyday of 77ie Blues Band (if you\nare old enough to remember them).\nFrontman Mars blows his fiery\nharmonica and sings with real\npresence\u2014when he says he's the\n'Number One Playboy' you'd better\nbelieve it!\u2014and he displays his talents\nin a varied rep e to ire, ranging from\nslow 12 bar through to ballads and\nrock-solid boogie.\nHis four-piece band is well\nrehearsed to the point that Mars'\ncomplex arrangements are tight, but\nnot so tight that the sense of invention\nand fun is gone\u2014their performance\npersuades Emmet, (he's not God he\njust runs things), to give him thirty\nyears on Earth to find Annie. Here\nwe move swiftly through the sixties\nwith Mike becoming Elmo, an\naspiring musician, while Annie has\nbecome Ally and married. The\nchances of them meeting when they\nknow nothing about each other are\nless than slim, but the opportunity for\nnear misses is cleverly explored.\nThe film does well to remain\nbelievable, with reliance placed on\nimagination and subtlety to good\neffect. Heaven really is fun, and here\nthe film scores admirably by creating\na realistic Utopia. Mostly the\ncharacters are convincing without\nbeing over-sentimental, but this is\nstretched at the end. There is plenty\nof scope for touches of wit with\nunexpected coincidences and timing\ntricks which result in an unusual\nromantic tale.\nA.N. WSI(T remains fresh on repeated hearing.\nNor do the players restrict themselves\nto the standard blues licks and\ntones\u2014the keyboards in particular get\naway from the clich ed piano/Fender\nRhodes sound employed by most\noutfits.\nWhether you've never listened to\nthe blues or you believe that blues\nstarted with Muddy Waters and ended\nwith Eric Clapton, you'll find the\nmodern approach of the Johnny Mars\nBand an education. Catch them in\nNovember at:\nPizza Express, Dean Street, 29th100 Club, Oxford Street, 16th Pied Bull, Islington, 10th,17 th and 24th R.C. mn/\nmama Roxanne\nRoxanne is the latest production\nstarring the talented American\ncomedian, Steve Martin. Also written\nby Martin, it is a modern portrayal\nof the classic Rostand character,\nCyrano de Bergerac, cast in the form\nof a small Northwest American town\nfire chief, CD. Bales.\n'CD' has everything, he is a popular and respected member of the\ncommunity, he has a nice house and\na good job (all this and he's hot a yuppie!). But he also has a problem,\nhis exceedingly large nose. Over the\nyears CD has learnt to deal effectively\nwith people who are unwise enough\nto make adverse comment, and this\ngenerates endless run, notably the big-nose joke-telling duel CD has with a drunken ta unter( 'Did your parents\nlose a bet with God?'). What he\ncannot deal with is his affection for\nyoung astronomy student , Roxanne\n(Daryl Hannah). Feeling that she will\nlaugh at him, he woos her through\nanother man, the hunk y and\nwonderfully dumb Chris (Rick\nRossovich), whose letters he writes,\nand even whose conversation he\ninvents (another hilarious scene).\nRoxanne, of course, falls in loVe with\nChris, believing him to be the\nintelligent and romantic author of the\nletters, and CD has no choice but to\nprolong the deception.\nAlthough the plot is reasonably\npredictable this is still a hugely\nenjoyable film. The atmosphere and\npace are relaxed and the comedy is\nnever forced. Steve Martin is faultless\nas the zany, sympathetic, loveable\nguy whom nature has cursed,\ncon jou ring up almost every emotion\nin the audience. Daryl Hannah is\ngorgeous, as ever, although I found\nit rather hard to believe her as a genius PhD student. Also along for\nall the fun is the wonderful Shelly\nDuvall, still without the starring role\nshe deserves, playing CD's friend\nDixie. Even if you've never seen\nSteve Martin before, I advise you to\nsee this film as it is Undoubtedly his\nbest yet. W Roxanne opens today.\"'\\\nit JI udi\nRory Curtis\nAaron Kotcheff\nAlex Noble pi if io db af ttt Bf lr jol L.'t, j tt s luft FELIX Friday November 6th1987 "

I have long been advising potential\nstudents to go for northern universities, unless they have\nspecial reasons for wanting to study elsewhere, because\nof the differences in accommodation costs. I find it difficult\nto get by in London on my research assistant's salary, so\nhow you students survive, I don't know.\nHowever, from the apathetic response to Mr Martin's letter, I assume you all either have rich mummies and\ndaddies buying you yuppie pads, or you couldn't give a toss if next year you're sleeping on the streets. As someone\nwho has several years experience comp aig ning on housing\nissues, I was going to go on and give some advice and\nsuggestions (eg why not link up with younger staff\nmembers like myself who have been squeezed out of the\nhousing market). But as you appa rend y can't be bothered,\nneither can I. Yours sincerely,\nMatthew Huntbach (Department of Computing).\nNo bigotry\nDear Judith,\nIn last week's FELIX, the letters page was dominated\nby the anti-abortionist point of view as expressed by PATA supporters. By asking a couple of questions of the authors\nof the letters in question, I would like to offer an alternative\nviewpoint that neither condemns, nor supports, abortion.\nWhen Paul Rice says... 'unless people are aware of the\ndestructive effects of abortion on mother and child...',\ndoes his use of 'people' mean parents, family, friends or\nsociety in general? Personally I would prefer the word\n'mother', for in the end, only she can decide what is best\nfor her, not 'people'.\nHugh MacKenzie asks, in an extremely condemning and\narrogantly self-righteous letter...'What concept of rights\nis in use that makes independence a clinching factor?'.\nTo Mr MacKenzie I would ask, 'Does a woman, on\nbecoming pregnant, lose the independence that gives her\nthe freedom to decide the course of her own life?\nThere are many people with strong views on abortion,\nand I suspect that the majority, both those for and against,\nare bigots, not willing to consider an alternative viewpoint.\nAfter all, how many women, especially here at IC, have\nhad to decide between life and death, how many men have\n'been there' during the deciding?\nSo, let's have less indoctrination, less bigotry and more\ncompassion and understanding.\nSteven Mercer, Physics III.\nNo imposition\nDear Judith,\nContrary to what was implied in a couple of last week's letters, I do not deny the dangers of abortion. However,\nI believe that rather than taking a stance which seeks to\nimpose one section of the population's moral views on\n. another by law, the following points should be addressed:\n1. Performing a late abortion is de human ising for both\nthe doctor and the mother, not to talk of dangerous. Rather\nthan make it illegal for the few desperate people who need\nlate abortions, the legislation should be changed so that\na woman who has considered her own personal\ncircumstances and has decided to have an abortion should\n| be able to get it within a week of her request. Such a speeding up of the system would substantially reduce the\nnumber of late abortions and make David Alton's Bill\nunnecessary.\n2. One source of late abortions is underage, girls who\nhave been too frightened to do anything about their\ncondition until it became obvious. This could obviously\nbe prevented by adequate sex education and also by doing\naway with the hypocritical morality that does not allow\na girl who is mature enough to realise that she may need\ncontraception to obtain it.\nOne of the last week's letters mentioned a talk organised\nby PATA on October 15. I fail to see the effectiveness\nof the chairman of the society advertising a cheese and\nwine in FELIX three weeks ago and the secretary\nrevealing, after the event, that it was actually a talk in\ndisguise! In fact, the only PATA event I have seen\nadvertised was some time last year and it was a talk given\nby a so-called 'victim' of abortion. I am afraid that a talk\ngiven by someone who denies responsibility for her own\nactions and allows herself to be called a victim is of no\ninterest to me. While we're on the subject, I didn't notice\nany dissenting voices from PATA at a pro-abortion talk\narranged by another society last week.\nFinally, I must apologise for the sexist assumption that\nonly a woman can feel empathy for a pro-choice stance.\nYours sincerely,\nKemi Adenubi, Civ Eng III.\nNot related\nDear Judith,\nI wonder if either of your readers have noticed the\nsimilarity between Moore Lyttle, ex-Union Bar Manager,\nand Norman Jardine, Union Catering Manager?\nNo? Well, I must confess that they do not look alike\nat all which makes it all the more surprising to discover\none of your ace news hounds conducting the en, r of his\nexclusive 'Norman Jardine' interview (Felix , oi) with\nnone other than Mr Lyttle. (He was sitting in the S^ack Bar after all...).\nOddly enough, Moore knows little about the price\nincreases affecting the Snack Bar as he has n* ver worked\nthere.\nShould you be planning any more in-depth probes into\nUnion pricing policies I would, of course, be more than\nhappy to answer any questions or even point out members\nof Union staff. However, I should hate for one of your\nhapless hacks to confuse me with Bryan Adams. *' e dreadful Canadian singer, to whom I am alleged to\na passing resemblance.\nI wonder if, by any chance, we are related?\nI think I should be told.\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Rose, Deputy President, Imperial College Union.\nFELIX Friday November 6th1987 IS\n\n"

Linzi\u2014\n\"Being photographed with my hair\nflat and no make-up on!\"\nJustin\u2014\n\"Missing a whole term of lectures THE BARON Whygate was going through one of his\ntemperamental phases. He was quite\ntemperamental all the time, of course, but\njust at the moment he was particularly bad-tempered. The reason was straightforward:\nhe could not find anyone to take him\nseriously over his plan to set up the\n'Whygate finishing school for new citizens'.\nWhygate was proud of this idea. (In fact\nhe was proud of all his ideas, especially\nwhen they involved his name). He was very\nconcerned that none of the Cheapskate\ncitizens knew how to behave proper iy at\npublic occasions, and thought that if any of\nthem did not know how to pass the port correctly it might affect them\nfor the rest of their lives.\nWhygate had been to a lot of formal suppers since the new citizens had\narrived in Cheapskate. All the citizens, he observed, seemed to take great\npleasure in drinking beer with salt in it and then vomiting all over the table.\nSome of them did not even know how to use a knife and fork properly.\nWorse still, some of the people from the Baron's castle were almost as bad.\nWhygate concluded that the citizens ought to be properly trained in table\nmanners and general etiquette so that they would be well enough behaved\nto have dinner with him. The first stage of his plan was to produce the\n'Whygate's guide to eating with the President; the dos and don'ts of formal\ndinners', which he would send to all the new citizens before they arrived\nin Cheapskate. This would give lots of useful information to the uncouth,\nbeer-swilling new citizens, including 'no smoking before the Queen's toast',\n'no footsie with the female citizen sitting opposite', and 'no pissing out\nof the window'. The guide would, of course, give the green light to\nremoving all clothes in the citizen's bar and spanking female citizen's bottoms, both of which Whygate did whenever he got the chance.\nWhygate had suggested that his special guide should be included in the\n'Citizen's guide to Cheapskate'. When he put this to the last editor, Pippa\nTrout, the citizen in charge of other citizen's happiness, she had said that\nshe did not think this was 'quite the right sort of material' for the Citizen's guide. Unfortunately, Whygate was too thick to realise that in anybody\nelse's language this would have been 'piss off, you moron'. (Trout was\nvery good at her job. She spent most of the day asking citizens if they\nwere all right, and was very upset and keen to help if anyone was feeling\nmiserable).\nBut Whygate was not very good at listening to any opinion other than\nhis own, and was not going to pay any attention to Trout or the other\nleading citizens. He was taking the same attitude over the Tis Soft and\nSell Spock dormitories. Whygate wanted to throw all the young citizens\nout of these two dormitories so that all the very old citizens could live\nthere. In fact this had not been Whygate's idea at all: it had been suggested\nto him by Arthur Michael, the good but not very useful fairy. Arthur Michael\nknew that Whygate was as much of a self-publicist as he was, and so\nhad convinced Whygate that the project was a good one by promising\nthat the name of the dormitories would be changed: they would be\ncollectively called the 'Michael-Whygate home for senior citizens\nWhygate thought that this would be an excellent bit of PR for himself\nand was not remotely concerned that several hundred young citizens would\nhave nowhere to live. It had not occurred to him that the only reason Arthur\nMichael wanted to turn the dormitories into an old folks home was that\nit would persuade lots old citizens from lands far away to come and live\nin Cheapskate, bringing lots of money with them. But then brains had never\nbeen one of Whygate's main assets....\nWill the senior citizens be able to cope with the stairs?\nWill Whygate bother to ask Dr Starsky, the guardian of the Tis Soft\nand Sell Spock dormitories, if he thinks it is a good idea?\nWill Dr Starsky be able to stop laughing?\nWhat does Whygate look like with no clothes on?\nFind out in the next episode of The Baron of Cheapskate.\nFELIX Friday November 6th1987 "

Although\nIC tried to play their usual flowing\nhockey, a poor pitch and inept\numpiring provided as much\nopposition as the inferior Surrey\nteam. Abusing the lax umpiring, IC\nset about the unprotected Surrey side.\nPaul Coleman, Mark Lewis (warned),\nSkipper Justin Brooking, 2nd team\nskipper Andy Lewis and goalie Simon\nChittendon (warned) were all lucky\nnot to get their marching orders.\nAlthough they only had two shots\nthroughout the game, it was Surrey\nwho led 1-0 at half-time, against the\nrun of play. With every player giving\n100%, IC fought back with Paul\nSkipworth equal ising from a Wright\ncross. He then scored the winner from\na penalty corner, giving IC an\nexcellent victory and Skipworth his\nsixth goal in five games.\nBoat\nIC 1st \u20142\nRSM 1st \u20142\nThe season has started slowly for IC\nwho have not been able to find any\nsort of form so far. This was a crucial\nmatch for IC who, after being\nknocked out of the Cup, needed a good win in the League to regain\nconfidence.\nRSM started the match determined\nand prepared to chase anything while\nIC did not show any such fire in their\ngame. The chasing and hassling paid\noff when RSM scored from a corner.\nAlthough IC created a few chances,\nthey were unable to hit the back of the\nnet. In the 36th minute RSM scored\nagain: a one-two combination which\nmanaged to beat the defence.\nIC started the second half in a different spirit, stringing passes\ntogether and creating space which was\nelusive to them in the first. The\npressure paid off when Edward\nCollision Head on\nWatney's Fours Head of the River\nOn Sunday, two Imperial teams raced\nat the Watney's Fours Head, a warm\nup for The Fours Head in two weeks\ntime. The crews were entered in the\nSenior A cox ed and cox less divisions\nin a field of some 45 crews.\nThe Senior A cox less four started\nfifth and after only about one minute\nwere in the process of overtaking a Thames Tradesman's crew when the\ntwo crews collided (not due, this time\nto the serpent-like steering of V Roper) losing IC over 15 seconds\nbefore they could continue. Despite\nthis IC finished second overall only\na few second behind the winners and\nwon the Senior A cox less fours\ndivision.\nThe Imperial cox ed four also rowed\nwell despite only just getting their\nboat repaired in time for the race and\nfinished a good fourth being the\nfastest cox ed four.\nCoates hit a volley from outside the\nbox into the top right-hand corner of\nthe net. With IC exerting even more\npressure on RSM's defence it looked\nonly a matter of time before another\ngoal.\nIn the 65th minute RSM's capt ian was pulled up for a foul and argued\nwith the referee. This lead to him\nbeing sent off which was a big blow\nfor a struggling team. With IC piling\non the pressure, RSM were defending\nwell until Nigel Collier was awarded\na penalty which he just managed to\nplace out of the goalies reach. With\nRSM defending well IC could not\npenetrate their defence until the dying\nminutes of the game when Adam\nThomas headed the ball home only to\nhear the final whistle go and the goal\nto be disallowed. Thefinalscore was\n2-2.\nCross Country\nBritish Rail win\nThis article was meant to give results\nfrom both York and UC relays.\nHowever after an abortive attempt to\nreach York thanks to British Rail, the\nYork team appeared on Parliament\nHill five minutes before the UC\nRelays. The start had to be delayed\nwhile a last minute entry was put in\nand the numbers reallocated to\nproduce first and second teams.\nOnce everyone was on the starting\nline though, the pre-race panic died\ndown and everyone had good runs\nover an undulating, but fairly short\ncourse. We have no official results at\nthe moment but the race was won by\nSouthampton with both Imperial\nteams putting up credible\nperformances.\nSailing\nAlternative men\nThis weekend we took a ladies and\nmens team to sail against UCA.\nThe first race, for the mens team\nwas quite eventful with Apostolos\nLeonidhopoulos proving he was\nworthy of his committee position,\nbefore the start, with help from his\ncrew Jenny Burton. The mens team\nthen went on to sail a very close race\nThe ladies team then went out for\ntheir first race of the season and\ndespite the fact that Carol Eastwick\nhadn'the l med for five years, went on\nto win.\nThe alternative mens team then\nwent on to beat UEA's mens team,\nmuch to the em baras s ment of the first\nteam.\nRESULTS\nFOOTBALL\nIC 1sts21 RSM-1sts IC 2nds22 \u2014IC 3rds IC 3rds \u20141 1-Surrey 3rds IC 2nds00 Surrey 2nds RUGBY\nIC 1sts712 Rosslyn Park 3rds IC 1sts320 Surrey Ists\nIC 2 nds419 Surrey 2nds BADMINTON-Mens\nIC\u20142 7-Surrey\nIC\u20149 0-Sussex\nIC 2 nd63 Surrey\nHOCKEY\nIC Ists\u20142 1-Harrow Ists\nIC 2 nd s06NP L2 nds IC 3rds24 UCL2 nds IC Ists\u20141 1-Surrey Ists\nMiddlesex Cup First Round\nIC 1sts \u20143 1-Meadowhurst\nLADIES HOCKEY\nIC\u20140 4-Surrey\nIC\u20145 7-Middlesex/UCH\nTABLE TENNIS\nIC 1sts \u20143 6-London Univ.\nIC 2nds54 Charter Diamond\nBadminton\nUAU matches\nOurfirstmatch was against Sussex\nUniversity and IC walked away with\nan easy victory 9-0. What was nice\nwas that our opponents gave all of our\npairs a good warm up for the coming\nseason, and a vital opportunity to get\nused to each other. This was\nparticularly important considering\nthat the crucial match against Surrey\nwas due to be played the following\nweek.\nAs it turned out we were well\nbeaten by Surrey who have again got\nquite a strong team. The deciding\nfactor was the pace at which the\nSurrey pairs played which was\nconsiderably faster than anyone at IC\nwas prepared for. However, our l sts, Sean Mulshaw and Simon Hughes,\ndid manage to win 2 rubbers, one Of\nwhich was a deserved victory against\nSurrey'sl sts. The rubber lasted 1 !4\nhours, Sean and Simon eventually\nwinning 14-18, 18-16, 18-16.\nDespite defeat for this 1st team, the\n2nds kept their heads up and managed\nto beat Surrey 6-3. Richard Langford\nand Alastair McMaster won all 3 of\ntheir rubbers and emphasised this by\nthe fact that there are more than just\n6 players capable of playing in the\nfirst team.\nRugby\nTechnical defeat\nIC 1st \u20147\nRosslyn Park 3rd \u201412\nIC's first run out against a club side\nresulted in a moral, if not points\nvictory.\nDespite playing against a massive\nbeer-sodden pack IC managed to win\na steady supply of ball for the backs\nIC backs adapted to the wet and\nwindy conditions better than the\nopposition and ran in the only try of\nthe match. Mike Anderson threw a xxx pass to the fullback, J F Blamo\n(ex-France, Barbarians under TK, etc)\nwho broke through the defence and\nsupplied Jimmy Sniffshark with an\neasy scoring opportunity.\nMarsh refereeing meant a stream of\ndubious penalties for Rosslyn Park\nfour of which were converted to give\nRosslyn Park a hollow victory.\n12\nFriday November 6th1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "UNDER B* THE\nMOOSJSCOPE\nby Steve Black\nI would like to thank Jason Lander for the article on the new Acorn computer.\nAnyone else is welcome to submit articles of a similar nature. If you are not\nconfident of your linguistic abilities, don't worry I can clean up whatever\nyou send. I am easy to contact via the FELIX Office, the letter racks in the\nChemistry foyer, or by phone (int 4642). I also welcome ideas even if you\ndon't have time to investigate them yourself, so if you want to see something\nexplained, drop us a line.\nNext week: is the earth a gas planet? and chaotic uses for pure mathematics.\nERRATUM: last week the labels on the chemical diagrams got confused\nduring the pasting up, it's not that my knowledge of chemical nomenclature\nis completely up the creek.\nThe influence of\ncars on wildlife\nThe car has com plei; hanged the\nway we live. Many .y cho logical studies have shown us ::hat we value\nthe car as a status sym ol and as an\noutlet for violent emc ns: getting\nfrom A to B is a relative minor use.\nThe influence of cars ii how we\nappreciate the environment has not\nbeen much studied; that is until now.\nAmerican Roger Knut on has just\npublished the definitive guide to how\ncars influence the environment and to\nhow drivers can appreciate the\nwildlife on the road. The book is\ncalled Flattened Fauna: a Field Guide\nto Common Animals of Roads, Streets\nand Highways.\nNormally, drivers miss e joys of\nnature on the road because a ey may\nhave the stereo turned up too much\nor they may not be watching where\nthey are going. Knutson's book offers\nthose drivers a chance to appreciate\nthe nature they would otherwise miss\n(or hit as the case may be). As he says\nin the book: ' A Sunday drive can\nbecome a safari into a new habitat\npopulated with animals unlike those\nyou have seen before.'\nThe book is filled with wonderfully\nclear silhouettes to aid with\nrecognition of the animals. There are\nalso some interesting zoological\nspeculations on the usefulness of\nmim mi cry in flat animals, however it\nis not clear how these fit in with\nconventional Darwinism: it is not, for\nexample, easy to explain the\nsimilarity of rusty hubcaps and the\npainted turtle in terms of convergent\nevolution.\nAll things considered the book\nmakes a wonderful departure from the\nhighly unnatural and contrived view\nof nature presented to us by the\nAttenboroughs of this world. I mean,\nwhen was the last time you saw a3D hedgehog? (Nature 329 p498) Jason Lander looks at RISC\nWhy less means\nmore for Acorn\nComputese, the language of computer\nbuffs, is laden with initials such as\nRAM, ROM,E PROM, and now\nRISC. RISC, standing for Reduced\nInstruction Set Computer, is a field\nin which Mike Mullen of Acorn\nComputers is deeply involved and\nabout which he talked to the Micro\nClub on 15th October.\nThe idea behind RISC is simple:\ndesign a computer chip that can do\nless but can do what remains much\nfaster. As always, however, the\nreality is different. Exactly what\nconstitutes a RISC machine is a subject of much heated debate. Purists\nhold that any machine capable of\ndoing more than the very simplest\ncomputing tasks is just not RISC.\nOthers, including Acorn, say that\nalmost any machine that has been\ntrimmed down should count. As an\nargument, this should run and run.\nBut just because a RISC chip has\nfewer instructions does not mean that\nit is inferior to any other type. A RISC chip can do anything other\nchips can do, but a RISC chip takes\nseveral instructions to do what other\nchips can do in one. However, most\ninstructions are simple ones, and the\nRISC chip is optimised for these. The\ngain in speed on the simple\ninstructions more than makes up for\nthe extra steps needed to emulate\ncomplex instructions. Since all this\nhappens at the machine-code level, all\nthe user notices is a faster computer.\nUsers working with FORTRAN or C or the much maligned BASIC( all of\nwhich do the dirty work of translating\nyour formulae into machine\ninstructions) will notice no difference\nexcept the increase in speed.\nAcorn's own RISC chip is called,\nun surprisingly, the Acorn RISC\nMachine or ARM (oh the imaginations\nof our computer designers!) and is nt\nthe heart of their new Archimedes\nmicrocomputer.\nThe Archimedes was designed\npartly as a replacement for the ageing\nBBC Micro, which is rapidly\nbecoming the computing equivalent of\nthe dinosaur. But Acorn also have the\nprofitable business market in their\nsights as they are releasing IBM emulation (software and hardware)\nfor the machine.\nThe original plan was to build their\ncomputer from other people's components, but they found this\nlimiting and expensive and so was\nborn 'Project A'. The main aims of\nthe project were to design their own\nchip (they had a lot of experience\nfrom designing the gate arrays on the\nBBC) and then to build a very fast\ncomputer around it. The Archimedes\nis the computer.\nIn terms of brute power the system\nis impressive. It is, at the moment,\nthe fastest micro in its class. It is\ncapable of handling three million\ninstructions per second (3 MIPS in\ncomputes e) on average, with a maximum of 8 MIPS. That is, one\ninstruction in the time it would take\na beam of light to cross London.\nThe graphics are good too. It can\ndisplay up to 256 different colours to\na resolution of 640 by 256 pixels, and\ncan produce animation at a sizable\nfraction of the speed of film. It can\nbe programmed to produce eight track\nstereo sound of Compact Disk\nquality. All of this is enough to turn\nthe average micro owner an\nunpleasant shade of green (which the\nmachine can probably display easily).\nBut the ARM is not alone. Other\nmore powerful RISC machines are\nalready on the market such as the\nInmos Transputer, which, unlike most\nother chips, can do several things at\nonce at RISC speed.\nThe Archimedes is, however, the\nfirst such micro to enter the\nmainstream computer market (Atari\nhave announced a Transputer-based\nmachine, but this won't be off the\ndrawing board before next June even\naccording to their estimates). The\nARM also has the advantage of being\nextremely cheap compared to rival\nchips. But the others may catch up\nand how long the Archimedes\nsurvives will depend as much on\nadvertising and luck as on its\nexceptional computing power.\nJason Lander, Physics 1\nFriday November 6th1987 FELIX\n\n"

The\nFootball, Hockey and Rugby teams were involved in the incidents, which\ntook place in the Student Union Bar at the University, in the evening after\nthe sports fixtures.\nAs the evening progressed some of\nthe students who stayed behind\ndisrupted Surrey's annual \" Union Quiz Nite\" by shouting out answers\nand heckling. Some also dived off the\nbalcony of the bar, and during a song\nmembers of the Rugby team\nundressed, offending some Surrey\nwomen students present. Plastic\nglasses were thrown, and Surrey\nclaim 200 glasses were broken during\nthe evening. They also claim that\nracist remarks were made to some\noverseas students present, and fights\nwere started, although this is disputed\nby the Imperial teams.\nThe President of their Students'\nUnion, Andy Young, decided to shut\nthe bar at 9.10pm because of the\ndisturbance. However, some of the\nImperial students then tried to force\nentry to a private disco going on in\nanother part of the building. Mr Young then set off the fire alarm in\norder to clear the building. Surrey\nclaim that some students still refused\nto leave, although the vi sting teams\nsaid they were only trying to reclaim\ntheir kit first.\nOnce outside the Bar, a further\n\u00a3400 of damage was caused by the\nImperial students when a shopping\ntrolley full of people was pushed\nthrough a plate glass window of a restaurant on the campus.\nA motion was taken to Surrey's Union General Meeting ( U GM) on\nTuesday by their President. It called\nfor the banning of all Imperial\nStudents from their building, and\nimposed conditions for allowing any\nvisiting sports teams into their Union\nbuilding. Due to strong opposition to\nthe motion by Surrey's own sports\nteams, the motion was defeated by a small majority.\nSurrey's President was very upset\nwith the behavior of the visiting\nstudents. He was quoted in Surrey's newspaper \"Bare Facts\" as saying\n\" No member of a visiting sports team\nfrom Imperial will ever set foot in this\nplace again while I'm here\". When\ncontacted by FELIX, he said he was\nnot sure of his next move after his\nU GM motion was thrown out. He\nadmitted that he had not contacted\nImperial officially yet, although he\n\"might do\" soon. The motion, had\nit been passed, would have mandated\nhim to write to Imperial \"deploring\nthe behaviour of our the students\"\nand sending them a bill for the\ndamage caused. He added that he\nwould like to see Imperial students\n\"banned from every College in the\ncountry\", and that he was in contact\nwith his regional NUS about possible\nfurther action.\nThe Surrey Deputy President,\nhowever, is very unhappy with the\nbad feeling that the incident is\ncausing. He told FELIX that \"it was\nhelping no one\" and that he was\nsurprised and sorry that their\nPresident had not been in touch with\nImperial yet.

She was arrested in 1979 and\nconvicted of editing A Chronicle of\nCurrent Events, the oldest Samizdat\npublication on human rights in the\nUSSR. Velikanova was sentenced to\nfour years imprisonment and five\nyears internal exile. Her imprisonment was spent in the Small\nZone, a special unit for women\npolitical prisoners in Mordovia.\nIt is a tribute to the courageous\nmutual support that has sprung up\nbetween the women prisoners that\nhunger-strikes and other non-violent\naction is used as a means to protest\nagainst ill-treatment of prisoners. In\nAugust 1983 Velikanova and Irina\nRatushinskaya, the poetess,\nconducted a hunger strike to support\na prisoner in 'solitary'. They were\nhandcuffed and force-fed by six men,\nthen left for five days in a window less cell to recover from the after-effects\nof the feeding procedure. Velikanova\nis now serving internal exile in a remote part of Kazakh SSR. She is\nnow fifty-five years old and suffers\nfrom hypertension, angina, arthritis\nand ischaemia. She is not due to be\nreleased until November 1988 unless\npeople appeal on her behalf.\nIf you wish to appeal, please send\ncourteous letters appealing for her\nrelease.

Our arrival at the red brick building\nset in attractive, though wind-battered, grounds was greeted with\ntea and biscuits but we soon got down\nto work with our first rehearsal in the\nschool gym. This term we are\npreparing the glories of Haydn's Four\nSeasons and the Bach Christmas\nOratorio for our concert on 11th December. (A date for your diaries.)\nLunch was followed by a free\nafternoon in which the bright sun\ntempted a lot of people outside to\nexplore the local village and country\nlanes. The abundance of pianos\nprovided some welcome relief from\nthe (may we hope, temporary) lack of\npractice facilities in College. Some\nmade a trip to Bodium Castle, whilst\nothers were content to soak up the sun\non the benches on the terrace.\nWe reconvened for yet more tea\nand Danish pastries and another\nrehearsal at which our sight reading\nwas sorely tested by Haydn's Summer\nStorm and our tongues grappled with\nthe German pronoun cia tion. Supper\nbrought back mixed memories of\nschool meals and then our evening\nrehearsal was followed by a party.\nYet more food and a magical punch\nconcoction sent us out to gather\naround a bonfire in good spirits. It\nwas a clear night and the bonfire\nburned magnificently sending\nglowing sparks high into the air.\nSpontaneous singing erupted of a very\nalternative nature to our previous\nexertions, definitely neither Haydn or\nBach and including some amusing\nimprovisations.\nThe Sunday morning rehearsal\nconsequently took off rather slowly\nbut we worked hard until lunch,\nbreaking, of course, for mid-morning\ntea and biscuits. Those who were not\ndrawn out into the sun after lunch\nlistened to a recording of our\nperformance of Handel's Dixit\nDominus last May. At our final rehearsal we went over\neverything we had learnt over the\nweekend. Another cup of tea\npreceded the return trip to London\nthrough the Sunday evening traffic\nand a hazy pink sunset. We look\nforward to sharing the fruits of our\nlabours with you in December.\nSOCIALIST\nFoot's talk\nThe Socialist Society present a speaker meeting with Paul Foot of the\nSocialist Workers Party at 1pm on\n13th November in the Senior\nCommon Room, Union Building.

All the clubs involved have\nsubmitted written reports of what\nhappened, which are being sent to\nSurrey. Union Officers at Imperial are\nunhappy that they still have not heard\nanything official from Surrey, and\nthat there has been no chance to put\nthe Imperial's side of the story\nforward.\nAthletics Clubs Committee Chair\nRobert Gee told FELIX that, once the\nfacts were sorted out, if anyone had\ndone anything wrong, the appropriate\naction would be taken against them.\nThe sports clubs claim that closing\nthe bar early, at 9.10pm, was \"asking\nfor trouble\" as the coaches booked\nto take the players home was not due\nuntil 10.30pm. In the past it has been\nthe practice to stagger the leaving time\nof the coaches, to give students a choice of how long to stay after the\nmatch. On this occasion, the coaches\nonly left at 5.30pm after the game,\nand at 10.30pm, prompting members\nof the Badminton team to catch the\ntrain home in the mid-evening. There\nwas a feeling that if the coaches had\nbeen staggered, some of the students\nwould have left earlier and some of\nthe problems would have been\navoided.\nThe first 'free chips' U GM took place\nin the J CR on Tuesday and was the\nfirst quo rate U GM of this academic\nsession.\nICU President Ian Howgate\nreported verbally that he was pushing\nfor an entertainments fund to be set\nup for the residents of Hamlet\nGardens who are getting a 'raw deal'\nat the moment. He wants \u00a3800 to\ncome from the residents' fund and\n\u00a3200 from College funds. He also\nreported that the Union does not yet\nhave control of the proceeds from the\nsale of Harlington gravel, although\nthe Union have stopped College\nadministration using the interest from\nany investments.\nDeputy President Alan Rose\nreported that Union Snack Bar prices\nwould be increasing as reported in last\nweek's FELIX.

Membership of the\nAssociation, the KCL A, costs \u00a35 and\nduring registration at the start of term\nthe college implied that membership\nof the Association was compulsory.\nThe students' union are angry as\nthis goes directly against an\nagreement which the college made\nlast year, they also point out that\nstudents are not given their grant to\njoin a graduate association.\nIn a poll of 130 students, 75 % said\nthat they had been told membership\nwas compulsory, 50% had actually\npaid to join, and % of these wanted\ntheir money back.\nAn edition of the K QC college\nnewspaper has been referred to the\ncollege solicitors as regards a possible\nlibel action, after they carried a cartoon depicting students dressed as\nsheep queueing at a KCL A desk with\na person reading a book titled 'Fraud\nMade Easy'.\nExtra cash\nUniversities are to get an extra \u00a361m next year, \u00a360m in 1990 and 1991,\non top of \u00a356m already announced to\ncover the increase in academics pay.\nMr Kenneth Baker, the Education\nSecretary, claimed that this meant an\nextra \u00a3131m for universities but the\nCommittee of Vice-Chancellors and\nPrincipals believe that the new money\nactually available will be only \u00a310m which would be swallowed up by an\ninflation increase.\nCollapse!\nResidents in a Hamlet Gardens flat\nhad a rude awakening last Friday\nwhen the ceiling of their shower\ncollapsed.

    "content": "; 3\nFirstly, I must apologise for the poor\nquality and lack of pages in this\nweek's issue. Our main printing press\nbroke down last week in the middle\nof printing FELIX782. This will not\nbe fixed until next week. Luckily we\nhave a very, very, very old back up\nmachine which got last and this\nweek's FELIXs out. But this machine\nalso broke down on Friday! This\nmeans that the Print Unit has been out\nof action since then. We managed a bod ge job on the old machine and\ndecided that it was better to get a bad\nquality FELIX out rather than no\nFELIX at all.\nAs regards the Print Unit, we are\nbattling to fulfil our printing\nobligations\u2014at least it means that our\nposters will be eye catching! Secondly, I must apologise to all\nthe people who submitted articles,\nreports, etc for this week's issue\nwhich we were unable to print due to\nthe lack of space.\nWHY ALL THE SECRECY? Over the weekend I was taken aside\nby the Selkirk sub warden and told of\nthe proposal to turn Selkirk and\nTizard into 'postgraduate only' halls.\nI was therefore exceptionally annoyed\nto find out that our President Ian\nHowgate had known of these\nproposals for at least a week before\nthis but had not thought to inform\nanybody. At the U GM on Tuesday he\nreported that it was to be decided at\nWednesday's Student Residence\nCommittee (SRC). He then asked for\ncomments from the floor! It was the\noverwhelming feeling of the U GM that not enough open discussion had\ntaken place and a motion was passed\nwhich asked Union reps to call for a de feral of any decision at the S RC meeting. It came as no surprise to me\nthat Mr Howgate is totally in favour\nof the College's plan for the halls. I think that it is scandalous that he tried\nto leave any discussion until the last\nminute and that he hasn't gone to the\nhalls to find out what postgraduates\nand residents of Selkirk/Tizard think\nof the plans. And why wasn't the\nstudent newspaper told of this until\nafter last week's issue came out?\nTHOUGHTS ON PG HALL SI'm not in favour of any sort of\nsegregation. However, most\npostgraduates I have spoken to have\nwelcomed College's idea. My only\nthoughts are that Selkirk and Tizard\nare better suited to undergraduates\nand their needs. Perhaps the newly\nacquired houses in Evelyn Gardens\nwould be a better choice?\nNEXT WEEK'S FELIX Remember it's the special Rag issue,\nprinting machines permitting, next\nFriday. All proceeds raised by\ncharging 20p for small ads and diary\nentries will go to Rag.\nFINALLY There are only a few sweatshirts left\nin stock and there's a staff meeting\ntoday at 1.00pm.

This was\nusually accompanied by a pitch battle\nthat took place between the CC Us on\nthe towpath. This battle has caused a lot of ill feeling in previous years so\nlast year the whole of Morphy Day\nchanged. The three C CU Execs\ndecided that a better Morphy Day\nwould be a race between the\npresidents to,see who could be the\nfirst to get a total stranger to go to\nHarrods for afternoon tea. This was\ngood fun for those involved but it was\na little restricted! This year the boat\nraces will again take place with the\nRugby Club's racing for the Morphy\nOar.

This\nyear many events\nhave been\nresurrected to make\nthe next few weeks\nthe busiest for\nmany a year.
