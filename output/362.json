    "content": "1 FELIX\nMike Williams\nAS THE Freshers inevitably begin to\ninvade Imperial College, the Union\nperfunctorily has to sit down and consider\nthe overwhelming multitude of problems,\nboth large and small, important and\ntrivial which it faces.\nThe majority of these problems have\none aspect ir re futa bly in common: They\nare recurrent. It is pretentious to consider\nthem as anything else. Looking back over\npast FELICES, there are a countless\nnumber of issues where the principal\ntopic is refectory prices, or student\naccommodation etc. Just as every year\nthese problems arise, so there is a new\nUnion administration to launch enthusiastically an attack on them. Proper\nsolutions are pie-in-the-sky stuff for they\nwould take too many crispy \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3's. The\nUnion's brief then is to search out the\ncommon ground that might exist between\nitself and the body that presents the\nproblem, and to fight for a compromise.\nDemanding a solution is a naivety in the\nextreme.\nNot surprisingly, the ICU Executive\nhave their own specialised problems at\nthe beginning of the year; each essentially\nhas his or her 'Baptism by Fire'. The\nPresident has reams of speeches to write,\ndialogues to maintain, protocol to suffer;\nthe Deputy President's piece de resistance\nis the Freshers' Fair; the Hon. Secretary's lot is undoubtedly the Parking Applications Committee where by it is her task\nto tell 193 applicants that they have\nbeen successful and to inform the\nestimated remainder of 400 that they\nhave been unsuccessful. Then there is the Parking Applications Appeals\nCommittee...\nOn the subject of Baptism by Fire',\nthis Freshers' issue of FELIX has been\na huge pain to produce, due to the\nsimple fact that material suddenly flooded\nthe office on copy day. Jeez, what a mess! I can only express my intense\nenvy of past Editors who simply had to\nget the copy together, edit it and send\nit off to the printers with appropriate\ninstruction. Period. End of commit t ment Nowadays one has to get the type actually set, cut out the master copy, glue\nit to a sheet (neatly and straight without\ngetting any glue smudges on it) and\n'composing' a lay-out to fill the pages.\nThen it's off to the litho-operator to make\nthe plate and run it off on the machine.\nFinally comes the folding, collating and\ndistribution. Still, what the hell.\nTo those fresher s who might be\ninterested in the production of FELIX, come along to either the FELIX Office\n(near the Union Archway) or to the stall\nin the New Union Office at Freshers.\nN.B. It looks good on any job application\nform to say that one has worked on a student's newspaper.\nN.B. We will be producing a mid-week\nFELIX SPECIAL, to appear next\nThursday. Copy date for this issue will\nbe Tuesday midday. The copy date for the\nnext FELIX proper will be Thursday\n3rd October. Small Adds can be accepted\nat ANY time depending on the space\navailable.\nWay Forward for the P.G.' s? Dear Sir,\nFor the benefit of new PGs\nwe'd like to fill in some of the\nbackground to the recently\nannounced demonstrating\nrates of \u00a32 per hour. Less\nthan 18 months ago most\ndepartments were paying \u00a31\nper contact hour. The exceptions\nbeing Physics \u2014 where many\nPGs belonged to an A.S.T.M. S. Union branch, and had negotiated a higher rate tied to\nthe Junior Lecturer's pay\nscale \u2014 and Maths who received\n\u00a31.50. Around this time the\nI.C. Postgraduate Group was\nformed with a policy of encouraging strong departmental\nand laboratory based groups.\nIt was these groups in Chemistry,\nPhysics, Maths, Metallurgy\nand Geology who provided the\nimpetus for the campaign on\ndemonstrating rates. Before\nthe general announcement of\n\u00a31.50 throughout the College,\nMetallurgy, in particular, and\nlater Geology were engaged\nin departmental struggles to\nwin higher rates. Only after\nMetallurgy Postgrads had made\nit abundantly clear that they\nwere prepared to withdraw\ntheir labour, did the department concede an increase to\n\u00a31.50. It was in this context\nof Postgraduate militancy in\nseveral departments that\ncollege wide increases were\nannounced.\nIn his article in the last\ncopy of Felix, Tom Abraham\n(Post. Grad. Affairs Officer)\nrefers to intermittent negotiations with the college \u2014\nhe should perhaps have put\nnegotiations in inverted commas Postgraduate students play\nvital roles in the running of\nthe college \u2014 a fact which is\nrecognised more clearly by\nthe Administration than by\nmany PG s. Where PG s have\norganised in their departments\nmany improvements' \"in conditions of work have been won.\nYour department probably\nhas aPG group \u2014 if not, why\nnot form one. Members of the\nestablished groups will be\nglad to help. Tom Abraham\nshould not accuse PG s of\napathy (even if it's true at.the\npresent), but should point out\nwhat they can achieve by\nconcerted effort.\nPete Canoell,\nMaths. PG. Joe Herbert son,\nMet.

This group is responsible for the welfare,\neducational and otherwise,\nof postgraduates in the college.\nIt is run by a committee consisting of chairman (myself),\nsecretary, treasurer, and\ndepartmental reps. We hope to\nmake Imperial College a better\nplace for postgraduates to live\nand work in. However, we can\nonly do this with the cooperation and active par-tic i|>f all the PG's at\nthe co.'t^e. So far this has\nnot been readily forthcoming,\nbut I hope you the fresher s will change this state of\naffairs, so that you can help\nus to help you.\nThe summer is over and our\npeace and quiet will soon be\ndisturbed by hordes of under-grads. On reflection it may not\nbe such a bad thing, as there\nshould be now an improvement\nin college facilities, which\nwere withdrawn from us in\norder to cater for conferences\nHATH AV OGA Weekly classes in Hatha Yoga, following the methods\nof Mr. Iyengar, author of 'Light on Yoga', will commence on Tuesday 1st October, 1974, from 5.30 to 7.00 p.m., in the Common Room, Department of Physics, Level 8.\nHatha Yoga is a practical way to attain a healthy body,\ntogether with a relaxed but disciplined mind, through\nthe regular practice of traditional Yoga exercises.\nFor further details, ring Int. 4064.\nand exhibitions.\nTowards the end of August,\nthe SRC in their infinite wisdom\ndecided, to postpone our grants\nfor three months. Rumblings\nof discontent reached my ears,\nwhereupon I reported to Trev\nPhillips (our beloved leader)\nthat there was unrest among\nthe 'peasants'. He took the\nmatter up with John Randall\n(our redeemer) who immediately\nwrote to Reg Prentice demanding\nthat this decision be reversed.\nUncle Reg did his conker s, because apparently neither he\nnor the DES knew anything\nabout it, and with an election\nin the offing and with postgraduates and others .(i.e. undergrads) able to swing the\nvote in certain marginal\nconstituencies (i.e. South\nKensington), this was just not\non. Within the hour the Research\ncouncils led by the SRC\nsur r ended. It was a glorious\nvictory in the battle against\nbureaucracy.\nFinally, on a more serious\nnote, it is union policy that all\ntur or ing and demonstrating\njobs be fully advertised to all\npostgraduates within each\ndepartment. If any departments\nare failing to advertise these\njobs, then the matter will have\nto be taken up with the college\nauthorities.\nNOWALLOVER LONDON\nWILLIAM PETER BLATT Y'S.

A week later ate tter from five first and second year students appeared in FELIX. Thus IC Campus Radio Society was launched, and now seven\nmonths later, we look forward\nto doing battle with the Home\nOffice \u2014 the final hurdle\nstanding between us and our\nradio licence.\nSo by next February we will\nbe broadcasting twenty-five\nhours a week of programmes to\nSouthside and Linstead Halls.\nA little later the service will\nbe extended to Weeks, Garden\nand Beit Hall. Eventually,\n(come a couple of years) IC\nRadio should cover the Student\nHalls and flats as well\n(hopefully!).\nIC Radio will be on the\nmedium wave band around 300\nmetres. You'll be able to pick\nit up on a radio anywhere in\nthe halls of residence.\nUnlike Felix IC Radio will\nbe able to provide an up to\ndate news service. Unlike\nSTOIC, ICR will be broadcasting in the evenings and at\nthe weekends when commer ical and BBC stations are not\nbroadcasting student-orientated\nprogrammes. Added to which\nit's much easier to produce a radio programme than a TV\nprogramme or a newspaper.\nWhilst IC Radio will not be\ntrying to drive either medium\ninto ob sole c en ce; it will fill a gap in the IC media which has\nup to now been lacking. One\nof its main tasks will be to\ngive SCAB organisations a cl.ance to introduce more\npeople to their activities. IC\nRadio will have close contact\nwith its listeners so that you\nget the service that you want.\nWe soon hope to get our\nlicence application back from\nthe Home Office. Then we can\nset up the aerial side of the\nsystem. Test transmissions\nshould start around November\nand the studio will be built as\nsoon as the Home Office gives\nus a full licence. To set up\nthe station we will need people\nto help. If you would like to be\npart of this new society or are\njust interested to see what\nit'll be like, come along to the\nFreshers' Fair tomorrow. We\nwill be there doing 'dummy'\nprogrammes, to give you an\nidea of what your radio station\nwill sound like. So come and\nsee us in the Union Concert\nHall. Or else, see either\nmyself (Linstead 528) or Mike\nElgey (Linstead 334), John\nAllen (Falmouth 113), Huw\nSaunders or Steve Brightman\n(both Physics 2).\nHALL\nRENTS\nJacqui Gerrard\nStudents who are residing in house or hall\nnext session have been sent a copy of the\n1974-75 Imperial College, Student Residence,\nHalls and Houses, Regulations and Information.\nOn page 10,11 it is written 'Subject to the\nterms of the Rent Act, the fees for 1974/75 will\nbe as follows:-'.

    "content": "6 FELIX\nSummer Trip To\nThe Dolomites\nMike Wright\nANYONE PASSING65 Evelyn Gardens\non the morning of August 3rd, may have\nwondered why the pavement was blocked\nby seven bodies, a large number of\nrucksacks, tents and a not inconsiderable\nquantity of dried curries and steamed\npuddings.\nEverything was ready for our annual\nsummer camping expedition\u2014everything\nexcept for the minibus, now boasting a new clutch, but sadly minus an exhaust\npipe.\nFinally with our own 'Jackie Stewart'\nat the wheel we arrived at the hover port in time to miss the flight by seconds.\nA fairly uneventful drive down\nthrough France brought us to a campsite\nat Annecy, not far from Chamonix. The\nfollowing day was spent struggling up\na hill in the blistering heat. The next\nstop was reached after an interesting\ndrive over the Petit St. Bernard Pass\ninto Italy, then via Turino and Milano\nto Nus near Lake Garda.\nTwo days were spent in Venice\nwhere our resident 'culture-vultures'\nsampled the delights of the Palazzo\nDucale and the legendary Ponte dei\nSospiri (Bridge of Sighs). By this time\nsome of the more energetic members\nof the party were craving for some more\nhills to climb, and so we set off for the\nDolomites.\nWe had our first real look at the\nDolomites after ascending the chair\nlift and cable car to the Rifugio di\nRosetta at 2581m in the Pale di San\nMartino. A pleasant day was spent\nwalking around the high plateau with\noccasional glimpses of the Fradusta\nglacier.\nWe camped at v^ prva ra for the next\nweek and from this base we were\ntreated to some of the most spectacular\nscenery that the Dolomites has to offer.\nA short drive from the campsite around\nan endless succession of hairpin bends\nled us to the foot of the Marmolada.\nThis is the highest mountain in the\nDolomites, the summit at 10,965ft being\nvisible for miles around.\nHalf of the party decided to walk to\nthe bottom of the glacier (an extensive\nglacier covers the northern slopes)\nwhile the others chose to ascend the\nmountain by cable car. A stroll across\nthe ice gave ample opportunity for the\ntaking of 'Look! Here I am climbing a vertical ice-field!' photographs. During\nthe first World War the Marmolada\nglacier was part of the front line and\nmany miles of tunnels were dug in the\nice. Another peak in the area the Col\ndi Lana gained such state gic importance\nthat the Italians finally blasted the\nsummit with five tons of high explosive.\nHaving seen the views from the\nMarmolada we knew that the nearby\nSasso Lungo would live up to all\nexpectations. The Sasso Lungo is one\nof the most impressive crests of the\nDolomites, stretching as it does for\nsome two miles above the Passo di\nSella. It was well worth the few\nhundred lire to ascend the lift to 2679m in order to sample the s cree on the way\ndown to the van.\nTo the north of Corvara, the mighty\nSellagruppe rises vertically from green\npastures to culminate in the Piz BoS\nat 10,339ft. This 1000ft rock pyramid\nwas reached after a sweaty climb in\nthe now customary blazing sunshine.\nThe descent to Corvara and the\ncampsite was no less spectacular. The\npath left the Rifugio di Boe and plunged\ndown into the Val di Mesdi at an\nalarming angle. An interesting slide\ndown a few hundred feet of ice and\nsnow led to firmer s cree slopes.\nThe next day we drove over the\nBrenner Pass into Austria and camped\nat Innsbruck. After stocking up with\nfood and booze we headed for Lermoos\nnear the border of Germany. A very\ngood day was spent climbing the\n6 000ft to the top of the Zugspitzethe highest peak in West Germany.\nThe summit was reached after an\nexhilarating scramble up metal foot\nstirrups and wire handrails over the\nshattered rocks.\nThe remaining days were spent\nswimming in the excellent lakes near\nLermoos and in visiting the castles,\nNeuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau,\nof King Ludwig.\nWe decided to return via Switzerland\nand France and were unfortunate enough\nto find a cafe in Boulogne which sold\nRed Barrel on our last night!\nIf you think that you would like to\nspend three weeks camping, walking\nand generally enjoying yourself \u2014\nall for about \u00a350 why not join ICYHA?\nDoes anyone fancy Scandinavia for\nnext summer?\nThe group is planning to visit\nCheddar, Dartmoor, Cader Idris and\nMalham in the Autumn term. There\nwill be a coffee evening and slideshow\nat the beginning of term to publicize\nthese events.\nThe following will be pleased to\nprovide further information about the\ngroups' activities:\nPhil Craven\u2014President\u2014Mech.

Friday\nSeptember 20th, saw the appearance\nof a far from retired Mr. Cohen at the\nRoyal Albert Hall.\nAfter greeting the backing music ian s \u2014 bassist John Miller (strangely clad\nin a bowler hat and black suit and\nlooking more like an undertaker),\nguitarist Jeff Layton, musical director\ncum pianist John Lissauer, and\nvocalists Emily Bindinger and Erin\nDickens \u2014 the audience warmly\napplauded the appearance of a grey-suited Mr. Cohen .\nHis more melancholic and sensual\nsongs, including 'Bird on a Wire',\n'Sisters of Mercy', and 'So Long.\nMarianne' were performed with a tuneful confidence and skillfully\nbacked by his musicians, although I thought the initial sounds were rather\nhol low.\nIt rather disappoints me that all\nMr. Cohen's songs are so depressing.\nA man of 40 should surely come to\ngrips with his problems (whatever\nthey may be). Many songs sti 11 contain\nan overdose of self-pity. Perhaps the\nanswer is that the audience reaction\nto such songs does nothing to\ndiscourage them.\nAfter the break we were treated\nto a Cohen solo which included the\nnew Chelsea Hotel' \u2014 an elegy about\na friend who he once met in this New\nYork hoteI.\nThe band's reappearance heralded\nthe start of a more healthy selection\nof new songs (from the recent album\nNew Skin For The Old Ceremony'),\nalong, of course, with the old\nfavourites. We were treated to a superbly mellow saxophone solo by\nJohn Layton. A weI come theme-change\ncame with another new song, 'There\nIs A War'. Written for the Israeli\nsoldiers in the Sinai Desert during\nhis 1973 visit, the song \u2014 with a catchy reggae rhythm \u2014 examines\nwhat it is to be Jewish.\nOnly the end of the set after 90\nminutes brought the appreciative but\nquiet audience to its feet. The scene,\nhowever, quickly became more than\na little ludicrous. Four encores and\neight songs later, when the auditor u im lights came on, it seemed that the\nconcert had finished. Apparently not\nsatisfied and possibly going for a new world record, Mr. Cohen reappeared\nfor the fifth time, (this time on his\nown), sang a final song and shook a few hands before finally leaving.\nTo me, all this seemed to be an\noverdose of ego-tripping.\nNevertheless, I am sure that Mr.\nCohen lost a few but gained many\nadmirers by this performance. I remain unconvinced.\nFOLIC\nMon30th Sept We d2nd Oct BAG?30 Union Lower Re fec \u2014 Adm.40 pC20p Mem) ft K CQ ADS Clive Dewey\nBEE GEES - CHARADE\n(R. S.O.

Despite the rumours that the academic\nwork-load is enormous, the College has maintained a tradition of\na high standard in sport. In\nfact, looking back over the\nyears, it is possible to see,\nalthough there have been\nlocalised fluctuations in\nfortunes, a continuous increase\nin the standard of sporting\nachievement in all of the clubs. The majority of students\nspend only three years at I.C.( though some manage longer\nstays; and it can be done both\nby passing and failing exams)\nand-of those three years, the\nlast one finds most students\nincreasing the work/play ratio,\nand so all sports clubs are\nheavily dependent on a large\nintake of fresher s every year\nto maintain their numbers.\nSo do not imagine that as a fresher you are trying to break\ninto some sort of established\nclique in the club or clubs of\nyour choice; all the sports\nclubs are desperately keen to\nhave you join, no matter what\nstandard you may personally\nhave attained.

    "content": "4 FELIX\n'PREC3 PUCE1\nAT THE start of every session, every\nPresident tends to burst forth in a rain of\nbanal platitudes, about the Union, urging\nall students to 'participate'more, to become\naware, etc , etc. It is difficult for him to\ndo otherwise. However, I believe that it is\nquite arrogant for any elected official to\nsay to his constituents 'Do as I say, and\neverything will be o.k.', and that 'You've\ngot rid of the last lot \u2014 it'll all be different\nnow'. I do urge you to participate in the\nactivities and the decision-making of the\nUnion, as far as you are able. That is your\nright and your duty, as a member of a democratic organisation. However, I recognise, and I think that the rest of the\nUnion's Officers do, as well, that we can\nonly expect you to participate if the Union\nis seen to be taking up the problems and\nissues that confront its membership. Above\nall else, we, the Union Officers, have a duty, not to the College or University, but\nto the membership of the Union \u2014 to inform,\nto organise, and to carry out, as best we\ncan, the wishes of the membership.\nThis is not to say that I think that the\nPresident should continually compromise,\nand pander to the whims and wishes of the\ncliques that surround and abound within\nthe Union. Certainly not. I hold definite\nviews and adhere to definite principles\nconcerning the issues confronting students;\nif I did not, it is unlikely that I would be\nPresident. Therefore, I shall always, try\nto put forward, in unity with the rest of the\nExecutive, a definite line on Union policy,\nand argue as strongly as I know how, for\nthe Union to adopt that line.\nThe issues and policies that I hope to\nsee the Union take up this year I will\n1 delineate below. However, it will be useful\nto look back over the summer (remember\nthat we have been in office since 1st August) and see what has been happening.\nLiving(?).\nThe accommodation crisis (and I use\nthe word advisedly) has been more acute\nthan ever, Despite, or because of, the fact\nthat IC is sited in the 'richest borough in\nBritain', Kensington and Chelsea, there\nis no kind of accommodation provided for\nnon-resident students. Many students are\nonce again trudging from their beds its in\nWandsworth, Clapham, even Uxbridge\nbecause of the high rents near College.\nA few lucky people find places nearby (and\nseldom realise how lucky they are), but of\nthe 65% of IC students living out of Hall\nprobably more than half live an unreasonable\ndistance from the College. In many cases,\nthe rooms offered are not of an acceptable\nstandard. Generally, though, the greatest\nproblem lies in actually finding suitable\nplaces i.e. where you can have a friend in\nafter 6 p.m., where you can play the radio,\nand, of course, where you can afford to pay\nthe bi Us\nRent Act.\nThe problem has been exacerbated by\nthe new amendments to the Rent Act,\ngiving students security of tenure. Many\nlandlords have, unjust if ica bly in my\nview, withdrawn their furnished flats\nfrom the student market, for fear that they\nwill not be able to shift students at the\nend of the year. When they want to put\nrents up, at this time, they cannot do so,\nunless they shift their tenants. Many are\nresorting to ruses such as giving some\nkind of 'bed and breakfast' deal, under\nwhich no-one has security; personally,\nI would have thought that students are\nmore likely to move out at the end of the\nyear than anyone else.\n/ discovered very early on that the\npeople suffering most in this respect are\nthose students who are married. There is\nno purpose-built or rented accommodation\nprovided for them; very te w married\ncouples will live with families, in digs,\nand given the introduction of the spouse's contribution to the student grant, not\nmany married couples can afford expensive\nflats. We have already contacted the\nCollege on this question, and we intend\nto press the case for the accommodation\nof married students in double/triple rooms\nin Student Houses and flats. This will\nnot be enough; first priority must be given\nto this in any future acquisition of property.\nThe Union Building.\nThe developments initiated last year,\nresulting in a transformation of the Union\nBuilding are nearly complete. Room at\nthe Top and the new Union Office are\nalmost ready, while NUS Travel has\nmoved downstairs into the Lounge.\nWe took the Executive and General\nOffices into the Union Building itself in\nthe hope that it would encourage people\nto use the Union and to relate the\nadministrative structure of the Union to\nthe rest of it. Similarly, all the Publications apparatus (including the dye line machine) is located under the Arch, to\nprovide a cohesive unit, under the aegis\nof the Publications Officer (who is also\nthe Editor of FELIX). New furniture has\nbeen moved in, and the old stuff thrown\nout. The Refectory is in considerably\nbetter shape than before, if not perfect.\nWe hope that, during this year, that\nthe Union Building will be the focus of\nstudent activity, and that all students\nwill regard it as their own building, where\nthey can sit, read, talk, or indulge in\ntheir own peculiar hobbies, and not as\nthe property of the groups that traditionally\nfrequent it.\nCC U's. Turning to the coming year, the role\nof the CCU's in student life cannot be\nignored. The function that they fulfill\nwithin the Union is largely social but\nessential, and will remain so. Large\nnumbers of students are involved in their\nactivities, and the CCU Presidents form\na link between the Executive and a section\nof the membership. Their attitudes and\nperformance are therefore, quite crucial\nto the organisational strength of the\nUnion. Without neglecting their duties to\nthe people who elected them, I expect\nthe CCU Presidents to play an important\npart, as members of the Executive, in the\nformation of policy and the forging of\nthat unity so necessary to the success\nof the Union's campaigns.\nMore Women.\nAmong the points that we have raised\nwith the College in the last year, one of\nthe most far-reaching is that of encouraging\nmore women to enter IC. On a purely\nsocial level, the effects of a ten-to-one\nratio is a 'closed' community like this\nare obvious.\nMore importantly, the fact that women\nare actively discouraged from taking up\ncareers in science and technology is a clear indication that even in the day of\nthe 'liberated' woman, the female sex is\nstill debarred, through the education\nsystem, from playing an important role in\nTrev Phillips\nour society and we must challenge this.\nAnother sector of our membership\nwhich still faces discrimination, nationally and locally, institution ally and\npersonally, and above all financially, is\nthe overseas students. The Union already\nhas extensive policy on this and we shall\nbe pursuing it throughout the year.\nEducation?\nOf all the questions raised amongst\nstudents, the most fundamental relate\ndirectly to the process of 'education'\nand the education system. The recent\nmassive cuts in the education budget,\nha vp had two m mediate ef fert s on stud p nts. The first is that the costs of services in\nthe College have shot up, e.g. Refectory\nprices and Hall fees rise (This is postdated however. See p.10 \u2014 Ed), thereby\nnullifying the effect of the grant rise.\nThus, it is wrong to argue, as some\npeople have, that the last award meant\nthe end of the Grants Campaign.\nWhat it did show was that we must\nnow concentrate not on the level of the\ngrant, but on putting an end to the\nanomalies and injustices in the system,\nparticularly the system of discretionary\nawards, and the Mean(s) Test.\nSecond, it is clear that the standards\nof education will drop. An indication of\nthis is given by the falling lecturer-student ratio and the loss of facilities,\nor even entire buildings. With the already\ninadequate teaching standards, it is clear\nthat the student's primary concern,\nattainment of a good education, is\nendangered.\nTeachers or Crammers?\nAlong with comp aig ning for better\nfinance, I hope that the Union will work\nfor an improvement in teaching, through\nproper training of new lecturers, and new\naudio-visual aids to teaching. One of the\nmost common complaints amongst undergraduates is poor lecturing; we have\nreached the stage where students skip\nlecturers simply because it would be of\nlittle use to go.\nCoupled with this, many members\nwould like to see the opportunities to\ntake Associated Studies expanded, without\nlosing the option to specialise. I agree,\nand will take this up very strongly,\nthough a few departments (who shall be\nnameless) still resist progress.\nThese are some of the policies that I will be pursuing during the year, and in\nfuture (shorter) (Thank God - Typist)\narticles will enlarge on them individually.\nIt is not enough for me to say, I shall\ndo this and do that. The President and\nExecutive are only influential by virtue\nof the fact that they speak for the Union.\nIt is only with the clear support of the\nUnion that their words or actions carry\nany weight. It is only with the hard work\nand commit t ment of the Union's Officers\nthat WP ran be successful: there must be\nno place tor the freeloaders and parasites\nthat continually refuse to work in the\ninterests of students while taking the\nbenefits of elected office. Finally, it is\nonly by unity in active campaigning that\nthe Union can improve the lot of its\nmembers.\n\n"

    "content": "No. 362\nMONDAY 30th SEPTEMBER 1974\nREFECTORY PRICES\nUP 17 PERCENT\nON THE last day of the previous College Session, the Board\nof Governors of Imperial College consented to rises in refectory prices across the board to the extent of a staggering 17Vi%. Despite urgent pleas for a subsidy by the Union delegation at\nthe meeting, the College felt that it had no choice in the matter.\nThe atmosphere at the Board\nof Governors was sympathetic\nyet uncompromising.\nCould College give the\nrefectories a subsidy? This\nwould be impossible under the\nUniversity Grants Committee\n(UGC) from which IC gets most\nof its money.\nDoes College have any\nmoney of its own that it could\nuse instead? 'College has\nsubstantial reserves, but they\nrefuse to use this money,\ndirectly in the interests of\nstudents, despite our (the\nUnion's) view that this kind of\ndemand should be a major\npriority', said the Union\nPresident, Mr. Trevor Phillips.\nThe two-point plan which\nthe delegation suggested was\nas follows:\n1. Short term. Let the increases\nbe only 10% and supply the\nrefectory with a subsidy.\n2. Lone term. The Governors\nshould lobby collectively and\nindividually the UGC for a relaxation of the imposing\nrestrictions regarding for what\nUGC money can and cannot be\nused.\nThe plan was countered by\nMr. M.J. Davies, Secretary to\nthe College, who firmly stated\nthat UGC rules are inflexible:\n'The books must balance;\nthere can be no subsidies'.\nThere was no area for\ncompromise. No Governor\nraised his or her voice in\nsupport of the Union's plan.\nNothing could be done.\nCopulation: A Discipline Offence\nZJZl^SW^i^SS! Tast \u00bb M*3 of HSMU Paul Gee clearly thought that ICU ought to clean up\n?ts hn a ee So in me early hours of Tuesday, 18th June, as one\nOT Jofnt Council was coming to a laborious conclusion, Paul\nproposed that Fornication on\nUnion premises should be a discipline offence\". Before\nmany of the steadily diminishing number of Council members\ncould awaken themselves, a speech for and against the\nmotion had been heard. In a last ditch effort to defend the\npermissiveness and personal\nfreedom of this modern society,\nMike Williams proposed an\namendment to the effect that\n\"Fornication should be enc our~ aged, not discouraged, on Union\npremises\".. This amendment\nwas tragically defeated, and on\na vote, the original motion was\npassed.\nCertainly, the implications\nof this motion are clear: To all\nbudding Romeos and egotists,\n\"If you want to do it, do it\nelsewhere, not on the Union\npremises \u2014 or the Deputy President will have it in for you\" .\nUndoubtedly, i^f dll be very\ninteresting to see vW at punishment is given out to the- first\noffending couple. Even more\n|,intriguing is that fornication is\nis an offence whilst presumably\ncopulation is not. No doubt\nthere will be some red\u2014faced\nwhen the first married couple\nis caught doing it in the Union.\nTO\n\n"

Humphries in 25 seconds)?\nYou may well ask.\nNow if a student can be\nroughly described as 'long-haired and between the ages\nof 18 and 25', it is not because\nmost students are long-haired\nand in that age range but\nbecause we create that\nimpression. The truth of the\nmatter is that university is a sort of shangri-la. How many\nstudents do you know suffering\nfrom old age? Which really\ngoes to prove my theory. Hair\nafter all, being a sign of youth\n(sadly admits my father, still\nmourning the loss of his last\nremaining strands). It is not\nuntil our bright university grad\nfinally leaves that age begins\nto show. With paper degree\nclutched in one clammy hand\nand ticket to what the French\nso aptly describe as 'metro,\nbou lot, metro, dodo' (bus,\nbusiness, bus, bed) in the\nother, he steps out into his\noyster. Wham, the clam closes.\nLines form, hair greys,\ncheeks sink. Mortgage,\ninsurance, teething, school\nfees: everything hacks away\nat his weak defences. Another\ngood man gone to the dogs.\nNever mind, close the ranks,\nbring in the fresher s. And\nso it goes on.\nI.F. \u2014' French Institute\nto the plebs and Institut\nFrancais to everyone else \u2014\nis situated in Cromwell\nPlace opposite a public\nhouse of equal ill repute\nknown as the Hoop and Toy .\nI.F. can be easily picked\nout by its peeling walls and\ngeneral look of neglect. Do\nnot be fooled. Inside are\n250 lovely ladies all doing\neither a one, two or three\nbi-lingual secretarial course,\nin some cases speaking\nSpanish, German or Russian\ntoo. All distinguished by\nthe fact that none of them\nintend to be secretaries\n(sit tapping at a machine all\nday and vowing undying\nsub service to a mere male,\nyou can't be serious!). Some\nbeing frustrated biologists\nand scientists, some frustrated archeologists and\nanthropologists and some\nfrustrated.\nDare to penetrate within\nthe imposing facade of 13a. Cromwell Mews (our Union\noffice) and you will have\nconquered an all-female\nstronghold \u2014 but will be\nvery welcome none the less.\nDrop in any time as long as\nit's between one and one\nthirty ('f raid so). Now you\nmust excuse me while I dash\noff. I have an appointment\nwith my ideological master.\n\n"

    "content": "a FELIX\ns TOP B FELIX 9\nThe Mascots and* he Presidents, Past and Present Having three Constituent\nColleges as well as IC Union\nmeans we have got three times\nas many mascots as other Col\u2014\nleg es i/ Universities, \u2014 and so\nthree times as many to be\nnicked . FELIX thought that it\nwould be a good idea to have\na mascots' get-together. The\nidea was to have all the C CU and ICU mascots and Presidents\npast and present on show. The\nfirst problem was that Guilds,\ndid not bring Spanner their\nmascot . They had had it nicked\nso many times that year and so\ndid not feel safe in bringing it\nalong . Instead thay brought a two-inch replica of Spanner\n(seen on Bo's bonnet).\nCity & Guilds had also been\nrepairing IC's long-lost mascot,\nMike. Claiming that it was not\nready and still bore scars of\nits visit to Queen Mary College\nthey had not brought Mike .\nC&G were not the only C CU to field a weakened team . Last\nyear's President of RCSU, M. Turner, had resigned the day\nbefore and had forgotten to tell\nthis year's President, Pete\nTeague to come along . Otherwise! all IC's mascots were\nthere.\nEven then the whole event\ndid not pass off as planned .\nWith all the photographs taken,\nC&G decided that Theta, an\nRCS mascot, should be nicked.\nLike many similar attempts\nlast year, it failed miserably.\nBut then mascot ry has always\nbeen characterised by things\ngetting nicked. IC's first mas-cot, a phoenix named Herbert\n(after Herbet G. Wells, who was\nonce a student at this college),\nwas no exception to the rule.\nChurchill College Cambridge\nhad managed to steal him in\n1964. Unable to recover him,\na Union meeting contemptuously decide to donate Herbert to\nthe same college.\nTwo years later ICU devised another mascot, Mike .\nIt is a four-foot long, 170lb working model of a micrometer\nscrew gu age. Designed in RCS, cast in Mines and machined in\nGuilds, Mike became regarded\nas one of the best mascots ever\nmade. Hence stringent (ho!\nho!) were made to ensure that\nit remained in IC's possession.\nAlas, Mike has been nicked\non many occasions. First by\nUniversity College in Dec em ber 1966, then by Kings in\nJune 1968 and most recently\nby Queen Mary College in\nJanuary 1970. Last year saw\nMike return to IC, thanks to the\nefforts of Dave Sinclair, and it\nwas on display at the AGM in\nJune.\nTurning to the CC U's, all three have vintage motorised\nand inviolate mascots. RCS have a1916 Dennis Fire Engine\ncalled Jezebel. This they have\nrestored to working order (des-pite last year's encounter with\na skip) and Jez makes many\ntrips each year \u2014 notably the\nRag Procession and the Commercial Vehicle Run.\nGuilds Vintage car is a1902 James & Browne tonne au called Boanerges, Bo for short.\nBo usually takes part in the\nLondon to Brighton run and last\nwon five cups in the Manchester to Blackpool run. Mines\nMines originally had a traction engine, Clementine I as their motorised mascot. This\nwas replaced several years ago\nby an old lorry painted in the\ncl leg e colours, called Clem II.\nAccompanying Jez and Bo\nare two lovely ladies, the\nQueen of Jez and Bo Belle.\nThe Q of J is the most beautiful\ngirl fresher in RCS( chosen at\nthe first RCS UGM) and Bo\nBelle is likewise in Guilds\nand is chosen in January.\nBoth these girls sit on their\nrespective vehicles and adorn\nthem everywhere they go. Both\nare also inviolate mascots.\nEach C CU has a number of\nviolate jn ascots, which \" d is appear\" every now and again.\nRCS have Theta, a giant 70lb thermometer, painted in RCS colours and this has so far\nproven to be un-nick able. Guilds have two very large\nand very heavy items called\nSpanner and Bolt. Spanner is raised above the President's head at the end of their Union\nmeetings.\nMines have perhaps the best\nviolate mascot in the form of\na large Davy lamp, seen left.\nLast year saw the revival of\nthe Wooden Horse Organisation\nand the Co-Ordinator this year\nis Dave Sinclair (Physics III).\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nInternational\nSocialists\nJoe Herbertson\nWho are we?\nThe International Socialists\nare the fastest growing and\nlargest revolutionary organisation in Britain today. A 'factory' branch exists in\nCollege with the main perspective of building a strong\nsocialist presence from within\nthe technical and manual\nworkers of the College.\nCurrent members are all active\nmembers of the College-based\ntrade unions, NUPE and\nASTMS, and are committed to\nfighting for militant policies\non wages and conditions, and\nfor extending democracy to\nachieve rank and file control.\nStudents .\nStudents are encouraged to\njoin or work with IS members,\nand in the past undergraduate\nmembers have committed\nthemselves to the main trade\nunion work. If sufficient\nstudents show an interest in\nstudent union politics, then\nan IS Society will be formed.\nA national IS student paper,\nthe Agitator, will make its\nappearance this term. Student\nwork in the Grants Campaign\nwill concentrate on the poor\ndeal Colleges of Further\nEducation received in the\nrecent grant increases. All students in and around IS\nwill be expected to sell\n'Socialist Worker' in the\ndepartments, to gain a personal\ncontact with College workers.\nThere is no place for student\nelitism. It will be up to student\nmembers to gain credibility\nfor socialist politics by serious\nand mature work, s uch c redi bi Ii ty has unfortunately been squandered by recent IC 'lefties'.\nBookstall.\nA regular books tall, with\nexcellent ordering facilities\nfor any left wing literature\nin print, will function on\nThursday lunchtimes in the\nJ. C.R., College Block.\nMeetings.\nRegular speaker meetings\non the politics of the International Socialists have\ncovered such topics as China,\nPortugal, Chile, Economic\ncrisis, rank and file trade\nunionism, and the National\nFront. Meetings in the near\nfuture should include industrial\nsafety, the Labour Party, the\nGeneral Strike, Portugal,\nracism and so on. Watch out\nfor leaflets and posters.\nOverseas Students.\nThe IS branch places\nspecial emphasis on involving\noverseas students, in particular\nthe older and more experienced\npostgraduates. Many of them\nknow from harsh experience\nwhat it means to suffer from\nimperialism, and these people\nshould provide a valid impetus\nfor solidarity campaigns. The\ncontinued domination of third\nworld countries has an important\ntechnological aspect and\nmoves to counteract this\nwithin this College should\nbe part of the political activities\nof overseas students in part-icu lar. Overseas students from\ncountries where the Church\nand the peasantry are still\nsignificant political factors\ncould gain useful experience\nby working inside British\npolitics which are directly\nthose of an advanced industrial\nsociety. Many overseas students\nwill want to make their\ninvolvement informal or even\nanonymous, and we clearly\nrecognise the seriousness of\ntheir positions.\nFINAL NOTE.\nThe potential for a strong\nrevolutionary socialist movement is great at the present\ntime in which Britain heads\nfor de eV economic and social\ncrisis. Big changes to the\nleft or right could come in the\nnext ten years. Make your\nchoice now, before it is too\nlate.\n\n"
