The views from this park over\nLondon are exquisite and breathtaking and on a clear day all the taller features (Gherkin etc) of central\nLondon are visible. The park itself is stunning and as well as being the home of several types of exotic trees\nit contains the Grove Garden and the Rose Garden which looks southeast over London. The main attraction of the park is technically Alexandra Palace, more commonly known as Ally Pally. This is named for\nPrincess (and later Queen) Alexandra of Denmark who married one of our Princes, Edward, and not for\nthe architect who designed the palace: Alexander Mackenzie. It was built as a \u201cpleasure ground\u201d with paid\nentry, housing some of the World Fairs, and today still serves that function in the form of exhibitions and\na wide range of music events.\nThe park is accessible via Wood green tube with the need for a bus journey too. However, for the more\nenergetically minded and bodied, Alexandra Park can be reached on foot from Finsbury Park via the Highgate Woods.\nSt James\u2019 Park\nThe park was first acquired by Henry VIII but has undergone many landscape changes since\nthat time. John Nash, of Regent\u2019s Park fame, helped in the process of landscaping which included the addition of the lake and scenic paths throughout the park. If Hampstead Heath is a\nlittle far to soak up some rustic flavour then St James\u2019 offers a more central location for some\nrural scenery if the right spot is found. Leafy plane trees inhabit the park and pelicans can be\nspotted lakeside. Situated to the east, St James\u2019 is a perfect green getaway after fumes of Picadilly Circus and if Green Park is heaving a bit too much with tourists and locals alike.\nRegent\u2019s Park\nRegent\u2019s park was an enclosed royal estate and hunting ground until 1835 but it was in 1811 that\nGeorge IV commissioned John Nash to reinvent the park which included the addition of terraces of\nfine houses on the east side, and the Grand Union Canal which flows along the north of the park.\nRegent\u2019s park is another immensely beautiful green addition to a city that has always been an urban\njungle and comes as welcome relief, breaking up the mayhem that would otherwise ensue between\nMarylebone and Camden Town. The location is perfect if one is out doing touristy things such\nas Madame Tussaud\u2019s, the Planetarium or going for a more \u201calternative\u201d alternative in Mecca (i.e.\nCamden). The park is home to our city\u2019s Zoo as well as the Queen Mary Rose garden that boasts at\nleast 400 rose varieties (another great opportunity for romantic ramblings). The boating lake, monuments and tree-lined walks are some of the things that await you here.\nKensington Gardens\nEveryone at Imperial will be familiar with these beautiful gardens. Home to the\nAlbert Memorial, in all its halcyon glory, the gardens are a welcome relief from\ntheir slightly more \u201cmainstream\u201d older sister, Hyde Park. The gardens have\ntheir own cultural offering in the form of the Serpentine art gallery and Kensington Palace - occasionally frequented by the Royal family. It contains two\nattractive water features, including the Italian water garden (commissioned by\nQueen Victoria) and lake, with deck chairs next to the lake. The presence of\ntiny green vans provide cool refreshment within easy walking distance of your\nchosen spot and a restaurant on the Lancaster Gate side of the park will provide something heartier. These gardens are a personal favorite of mine for their\ntranquility and beauty and the animals certainly seem to think so as the park is\nhome to considerably more wildlife than Hyde Park. Playground crashing opportunity also exists here.\nWritten by Caz Knight, designed by Rosie Grayburn\nNext time...\nIs there a particular guide you\u2019d like?

    "content": "Gilead Amit\n10 felix Friday 23 May 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nApologies, but I feel a rant coming on...\nSir,\nBetween Jaimie Henry's, \"A Geek\"'s\nand Matthew Kaufeler's assessments\nof Boris Johnson's election in their articles in the last issue of Felix, I think\none could possibly raise a question of\nbias in the Imperial student paper, especially as their attacks on the London\nMayor were all entirely gratuitous considering the unrelated points of their\nrespective articles. However, I am less\nbothered by the liberal leanings of a\nuniversity paper (who'd have thought?)\nand far more concerned by the suggestion presented by both Mr. Kaufeler\nand Mr. Henry that anyone who voted\nfor Mr. Johnson did so because they\nthought him a joker and a legend.\nThis view is not just myopic, but\nrather offensive to the majority of people who voted for Johnson for serious\nreasons; A few may have voted for Mr.\nJohnson because they were concerned\nwith the crippling taxes his predeces-Letters to Felix\nBias and Boris\nbashing\nsor charged the people of London (it is\nnot impressive to achieve a lot if one\nsimply overcharges everyone and then\noperates in a wasteful manner \u2013 see:\nMetronet). There were some who voted for Mr. Johnson because they would\nlike to see the police have the ability\nto deal with crime in a more effective\nmanner. Some perfectly reasonable\npeople were slightly concerned about\nhaving a Mayor who siphoned off\npublic funds to his friends' \"special\nprojects\" (also known as \"holidays\")\nand used vast amounts of tax money\nto retain unnecessary staff. And, of\ncourse, some actually admired Boris.\nThis scholarship-winning, Oxford-educated \"idiot\" has on many an occasion\ndisplayed an honesty that is virtually\nnon-existent in the political world. He\nhas shown a willingness not to toe the\nparty line over his own beliefs when it\nwould be much simpler to be a hack. It\nis a foolish mistake to confuse quirki-ness with a lack of intelligence, to mix\nup personal disarray with professional\ninability.\nIf the friends of Mr. Kaufeler and Mr.\nHenry only voted for Boris because\nthey liked \"Have I got News For You\",\nthen I would suggest that they find\nmore enlightened conservative acquaintances for debate.\nAbioye A Oyetunji\nJaimie Henry responds,\nWhilst I generally don\u2019t feel that I have\nto defend the views I write for a University newspaper column, there are some\npoints that Abioye A Oyetunji raised\nthat, rather unfortunately, grossly misrepresent the message I was writing.\nRegarding the apparent one-sided\nattack by Felix on Boris, perhaps you\nshould consider why the articles had\nbeen written by numerous independent\ncontributors, who no doubt have very\ndifferent ideals. Claims of bias would\nonly be true if Felix had declined to publish any anti-Ken articles (and indeed,\nconsidering the TfL photocard debacle\nthat has been extensively covered in the\npast, this can hardly be the case). Seeing as Felix probably received no anti-Ken articles [Correct \u2013 Editor], one can\nonly assume that the reason why the\npaper appeared anti-Boris was because\nmany students held genuine concerns\nregarding his ability as Mayor.\nI do not have a problem with people\nvoting for Boris. I thought I had made it\nblithely obvious that I am ecstatic that\ndemocracy is working in the general\nsense that people are getting out and\nvoting. And of course Boris will have\nnumerous supporters who truly support his ideals. My worry is that many\nvoters are becoming blind to what they\nare really voting for. Whilst this is less\nimportant for someone who could almost be competent, such as Boris, it\nis nothing less than horrifying when it\nspreads to extremist parties such as\nthe BNP, as I outlined in my article. I\nam not wishing to be too partisan here;\nif you felt that Ken was wasteful and\nvoted against him, then this is good. If\nyou think Boris will cut crime and you\nbelieve his manifesto, then even better.\nIf you chose Boris as a buffoon and a bit\nof a laugh, then you don\u2019t deserve your\nvote, because you run the risk of doing\nthe same for extremists.\nBut seeing as you did raise political issues, I will address some of them\nbriefly. Boris\u2019 policies, as yet, seem\nworthless. The RMT say that his \u201cno\nalcohol\u201d rule on public transport will\nnot be enforced by their members for\ntheir own safety; moreover it has been\nillegal to be intoxicated on the Underground for years. Generally people who\nare drunk and abusive tend to already\nbe drunk and abusive before they get\non the tube; any drinking they do on\nthe tube is comparatively insignificant.\nAs for the police, it is doubtful if Boris\nhas the power to overturn the recommendations of the Stephen Lawrence\ninquiry and remove Stop and Account\nforms, especially when racial tensions\nbetween police and ethnic minority\ncommunities are on a knife edge. I can\nsee plenty of empty promises on the ho-rizon, so I probably shouldn\u2019t need to\nsay that Boris has been proven to have\nlied to his own party leader and has\nbeen involved in some very questionable activities (including attempting to\nassist a known thug in assaulting an investigative journalist). Noble qualities\nin a \u201cserious,\n\u201d albeit \u201cquirky\u201d politician,\nI\u2019m sure.\nBy the way, I do not select my friends\non the basis of their political ideals,\nhowever well informed they may be.\nThis is mainly because I don\u2019t want to\nturn into Harry Enfield\u2019s \u201cTory Boy.\n\u201d\nI\n\u2019m finding it hard to get started\nthis week. The noise you can\u2019t\nhear in the background is the\nrabid chanting of thousands of\nfans in a Moscow stadium waiting for the final of the UEFA Champion\u2019s League to begin. By the time you\nread this, you\u2019ll know what the result\nis. What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll probably care.\nWell, I suppose you\u2019re entitled to. For\nmy part, the only reason I\u2019m sitting\nwithin earshot is because I\u2019ve got nowhere else to write.\nAh, ITV have courteously informed\nme that there are ten minutes till kick-off. Well, let\u2019s see if I can get this done\nby the time the endless succession of\nbeer adverts finish.\nOh look, a half-naked lady was in\nthat one. Surprise surprise.\nIt\u2019s beginning to occur to me that this\nis coming across as a touch snobbish.\nI\u2019m sorry about that, this is just my\nill-tempered reaction to the increasingly pathetic quality of the television\nadverts my eardrums are being pierced\nby. I\u2019m not an elitist. Well, I suppose\nI am, but not when it comes to football or any related activity. If my elitism exists at all, it\u2019s when it comes to\nthought.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; I have no objection to people voicing opinions I disagree with, or even to people voicing\nstupid opinions I disagree with. The\nonly thing I ask for is that people keep\nthem away from me. Is that too much\nto ask?\nSome people develop allergies to pol-len, others to various animals, foods or\nchemicals. I\u2019m allergic to most cats, the\nheat, and, for some inexplicable reason,\nnickel. In addition to that, I\u2019m allergic\nto stupidity.\nI feel a strong inclination to vomit\nwhen I get in close proximity to fuzzy\nthinking, incoherent rambling and the\nmind-warping ignorance that some\npeople believe passes for valid opinion.\nAs a result, of course, I\u2019m mildly allergic to myself.\nThe biggest curse for people with my\ncondition is the omnipresent YouTube.\nLike everyone else with a computer\nand time to kill, I spend a great deal\ntoo much time on that infernal web-site. No matter how hard I force myself\nto only look at the videos, however, I\noccasionally find myself glancing at the\ncomments section underneath.\nThese experiences inevitably result\nin the same questions flashing through\nmy mind. Where do these people come\nfrom? In what filth-infested slime do\nthese cretins that people the web make\ntheir home? Where are they all? Is\nthere a baboon colony somewhere that\nhas been granted internet privileges? If\nanything in the world is likely to bring\nme out in hives, it is the sheer, unadul-terated, moronic idiocy that displays\nitself in the dank recesses of the Net.\nAnonymity is, of course, the greatest\ndisinhibitor. As a result, the internet is\na fertile breeding ground for bigotry\nand general insanity. A few choice moments on the right websites can bring\nyou face-to-url with some of the greatest charlatans, freaks and idiots that\nare out there.\nThe offers to send money to West\nAfrican generals, the endless stream\nof (fairly insulting) e-mails implying\nthe inadequacy of my manhood, the\nconcspiracy theorists, the more disconcerting brand of political zealot;\nall these are to be found in the world\u2019s\nlargest arena. Usually, I can laugh it off.\nOccasionally, though, something tips\nme over the edge. And it\u2019s a long way\nto fall.\nStill, as I make a superhuman effort\nto cool myself down, I admit that I have\nno objection to these evolutionary\nthrowbacks eking out their miserable\nexistence wherever they do. They can\nspout their unspeakable bilge to anyone they know who has the ability to\nunderstand English. But please, please,\nfor God\u2019s sake, keep it away from me.\n\u201c\nI have no\nobjection to\npeople voicing\nstupid opinions\n... The only\nthing I ask for\nis that people\nkeep them away\nfrom me. Is that\ntoo much to\nask?\n\u201d Oh, one day to be able to rant like Angry Geek\nThis article contains frustration of an adult nature\n\n"

About 1 in 5 of these\ngraduates earn at least \u00a390,000 a year,\ncompared to 1 in 20 from ex-polys.\nThis is very likely to be linked to the\nfact that graduate recruiters tend to be\namongst the highest paying employers\nand they happen to recruit almost exclusively from top ranked institutions.\nThe universities previously mentioned\nhave a very high proportion of students\nentering graduate employment at places like investment banks, management\nconsultancies and companies such\nas Proctor and Gamble, GlaxoSmithLittle Timmy can\u2019t work out what the hell is going on either...\nA myriad of police officers arrived outside the Sir Alexander\nFleming building on Wednesday afternoon when security guards\nstumbled upon a suspicious bag. Four police cars turned up\naccording to one onlooker, and the entire building had to be\nevacuated for approximately 30 minutes to secure the area.\nThankfully, the offending item was no more than a suspicious bag.\nAlthough the incident proved to be a false alarm, police officers\nreassured the security guards that they \u201cdid the right thing.\u201d\nKline, etc.\nAccording to the survey, roughly 1 in\n3 students who left these universities in\nthe mid \u201890s own the house they live in,\ncompared to 1 in 5 for graduates from\nother universities and just over 1 in 10\nfor non-graduates.\nThese findings are likely to bring\ncomfort and distress to Imperial stu-dents. Comfort to those who are already certain that they will sell their\nsoul to the city when they graduate\nand distress to those who will sacrifice a large pay-packet for a career in\nscience.\nEarlier this term Felix reported on the\napparent success of former writing-up\nstudent, Matthew Yong, in his battle for Council Tax exemption against\nCamden Council. Mr Yong was requested to attend court on 20th March,\nbut literally before entering, Camden\nCouncil withdrew the summons. A\nfew weeks later he was issued with an\nofficial Summons Withdrawal Notice,\nwhich Felix even printed a copy of in\nissue 1,401.\nMr Yong was set to sell his story to\nthis paper, but he was stopped in his\ntracks when Camden Council took a\nU-turn on their decision. After writing\nto his council for confirmation that a\nline could be drawn under the ordeal,\nhe received a letter on 6th May stating:\n\u201cI regret that the Council stands by\nits decision not to award you full exemption between 4 July 2007 and 5\nJanuary 2008.\u201d\nAccording to Camden Council, Mr\nYong owes them \u00a3804.52 despite being\nissued with the Summons Withdrawal\nNotice.\nFelix contacted Camden Council in\nan attempt to determine what the hell\nis going on, but this author was met\nwith cries of \u201cData Protection Act.\u201d\nMr Yong says that he doesn\u2019t have\ntime to keep dealing with the Council.\nHe has written to the NUS (National\nUnion of Students), the NPC (National\nPostgraduate Committee) and the Union seeking funding to help him pay for\nany further legal costs.\nThe trial continues...\n\n"

Somehow though, she managed to overcome any memory loss and write us this review\nT\nhis was my second visit to\nthe Duke of York\u2019s theatre\nsince I have started writing for Felix, the first being\nto see the ill-fated \u201cRent\nRemixed\u201d, and it appears they have not\ndone much to the theatre since then as\neven the set seemed very familiar. After having to run to the theatre to get\nthere in time, due to an uncooperative\ntube, I just had time to flick through\nthe program to find that a) the friend\nI was with had seen Lindsay Duncan\n(Martha) on stage before and b) Hannah Murray (Mia) was the anorexic\none in Skins.\nThat Face was originally performed\nat the Royal Court, Sloane Square, one\nof the forerunners for original play-wrights. It has helped to develop pieces\nsuch as East is East and Shopping and\nFucking and has gained much acclaim\nin nurturing new talent. The talent in\nthis case is Polly Stenham. That Face is\nStenham\u2019s debut play and an incredible\ndebut at that, a remarkable feat given\nthat she was only nineteen when she\nwrote it (I only found this out whilst\nwriting this review and am now thoroughly depressed as I\u2019m nineteen and\nall I\u2019ve got to show for my life is a rather large debt). After its well-received\npremiere at the Royal Court Upstairs\nlast year, That Face has now arrived at\nthe Duke of York\u2019s theatre with a bang:\nor perhaps a loud guitar riff would be\nmore fitting.\nMany plays I have seen have a tendency to be wimpish about informing\nyou of the actual plot - not here. The\nfirst scene is the catalyst for everything\nelse you are about to see. We are taken\nto a private school-girl\u2019s dorm where a\nbalaclava-wearing girl is being given\nher \u201cinitiation\u201d. However, we never see\nthe initiation as she has been drugged\nwith valium and is hence unconscious.\nWhat makes this worse is that she has\nbeen drugged by an incompetent fifteen year old. We learn that this fifteen\nyear old is Mia (Hannah Murray), the\ndaughter of Martha (Lindsay Duncan)\nan incompetent drunk/pill pusher\nwho is being provided for by her son\nHenry (Matt Smith). Henry is trying to\nkeep his family together and also keep\ntheir life a secret from his father Hugh\n(Julian Wadham) who is with his second wife in Hong Kong. The first two\nscenes showed the contrast between\nthe lives of mother and daughter. Mia\u2019s\nboarding school life is orderly, even\nbordering on the military with Izzy, her\nhouse leader, as sergeant, in contrast to\nher mother\u2019s tiny trashed house strewn\nwith wine bottles and books. The whole\nsituation is real life turned on its head,\nHenry acts as both mother and father\nto Mia and Martha, Martha being the\nuncooperative stubborn teenager and\nHugh the prodigal son.\nAs the play progresses we see the effects that Mia\u2019s impending expulsion\nfrom school has on the family: everyone except Martha who does not seem\nto care on account of being drunk.\nStenham ensures that each character\ntreats the situation in a way that belies them - Mia does not think it\u2019s a\nproblem, Henry nearly falls apart and\nHugh just throws money at the prob-lem. Throughout this Martha appears\nto be in her own world where it is just\nshe and Henry, who she treats as both\na young boy and a soldier although he\nis an eighteen year old art student. The\nsituation comes to a head in the final\nscene where (for once) the storyline\nis actually resolved (I won\u2019t say how,\nyou\u2019ll have to see the play for yourself).\nIn my experience this is a rare but good\nthing for a play to do; having paid to\nsee a play, it is nice not to have to make\nup the ending myself. The play moved\nat such a pace that I had no time to look\nat my programme (something I usually\ndo when bored) and so I expected I\nwould have time to do that during the\ninterval. But by the last scene as all the\nends were being tied up and there was\nnowhere else for the play to go I got a\nbit suspicious. When the cast came out\nfor their bows I realised there was no\ninterval, thus proving that Wikipedia\nis wrong, as it claimed the play was in\ntwo parts. Oh well, at least it meant I\ncouldn\u2019t waste my money on wanky ice\ncream.\nI thought That Face was an incredibly\nintelligent and astute look at a family\nin turmoil, Stenham\u2019s writing was fresh\nand up-to-date without losing the classic feel of a West End play. Her observations of life as a teenager were witty\nand shrewd, obviously it helps that she\nwas still one herself whilst writing it.\nAlthough I have never been faced with\nthe problems addressed by the play I\nfelt that the writing was realistic and I\ncould understand and sympathise with\nall the characters and their emotions.\nOf course this could not have been\nachieved without the efforts of the director and the actors.\nJeremy Herrin\u2019s use of the space (the\nDuke of York\u2019s is a rather more square\nspace than the deeper and narrow\none that you would want) was really\ninventive, storing the main bed set at\nthe back so that you are constantly reminded of the state of Martha\u2019s world\nand the looming chaos and having the\nbed slide down the set as if being thrust\nback into the audience\u2019s mind. I also\nloved his scene transitions, as the set\nwas very minimalistic with no backgrounds as such and everything happening in this white space. The characters from the last scene would stay in a\nslight blackout as if observing the next\ncharacters\u2019 lives. The next characters\nwould bring on the scenery for their\nscene, as though bringing their emotional baggage with them.\nThe quality of acting was astounding\n(or as I put in a text to a friend afterwards \u201cIT WAS FUCKING AMAZING!!!\u201d). The only weak link I found\nto be Hannah Murray, she seemed\nHannah Murray. Yes, the anorexic one in Skins. Also known as Cassie\nat times to not quite understand her\ncharacter\u2019s motivation for her actions\nalmost saying the lines but not taking\nin their meaning. I think this will come\nwith time and as she plays the role\nmore will become more confident and\nmore aware of herself as the character\nof Mia. Someone I haven\u2019t mentioned\nyet is Catherine Steadman as Izzy, the\nschool bully and posh totty. Although\nthis is only a small part she stole every\nscene she was in as this nonchalant,\nselfish bitch who only cared about\ngetting out of trouble and getting laid\n(both of which she achieves). Lindsay\nDuncan, as expected, was outstanding\nas the out-of-her-head Martha. She\nmade her character loveable despite\nwhat she had done to her family but\ncould turn her emotions at any point\njust as a real drunk would. Her relationship with Henry varied from absolute adoration to sheer hatred and in a\npseudo-sexual Freudian relationship,\nMartha gives Henry a lovebite in an\nattempt to mark him as her territory.\nLook out for her \u201cconversation\u201d with\nthe talking clock - absolute genius! The\nindividual that stood out most for me\nwas Matt Smith as Henry. At first I was\nnot too sure about him - his accent\nwas funny in a stuck-up posh way and\nI could not work out why he seemed\nto be acting like a small child. This was\nall part of the character playing up to\nhis mother to keep her reality alive. As\nthe play progressed Smith\u2019s character\nstruggles to hold his family together\nuntil he finally snaps. The final scene\nwas harrowing and heartbreaking as\nHenry loses it whilst dressed in his\nmother\u2019s nightgown and pearls. Smith\nmade his pain accessible to the audi-ence, opening himself up completely.\nI was truly disturbed by his transition\nfrom normal teenager to a character\nmore like his mother.\nThat Face is a genuine, freakish\nlook at modern family life and essential viewing for anyone who likes to\ndrink lots of alcohol or know someone who does. It\u2019s a harrowing tale\nof what alcohol can to do to you and\nthose around you; ultimately it is not\nthe drunk whose life is ruined but the\npeople who care for them. That Face is\nan extraordinarily powerful play and is\ndefinitely worth a visit to before it ends\non 5th July, tickets start at \u00a310 with\nthe Royal Court offering an allocation\nof top price tickets for \u00a325 if you book\nthrough their box office. Plus we were\nout by nine leaving plenty of time to do\nlots of *cough* revision.\nFor more information about the\nplay and how to get tickets, log\nonto www.dukeofyorkstheatre.\nco.uk\nThe alcoholic Martha, played by Lindsay Duncan\n\n"

Write for us\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nG\nreetings, erudite Imperialist! As I write this the sun is\nshining and I hope you are\nprocrastinating revision to\nenjoy the weather and give\nthe left side of your brain a rest from all\nthose numbers, rules and facts while indulging the right side of your brain with\nsome art, creativity and randomness.\nRid your cluttered mind and indulge in\nsome fantasy created by artist H.R. Giger,\nthe man my article to the right is about.\nIf his work is a little too far out for you,\nthen perhaps both Derren Brown\u2019s hypnosis and artistic skills will provide more\nsuitable relief from the Nernst equation.\nThose dreaming of the approaching day\nwhen they can cease their abstinence and\ngo on an alcohol rampage, take heed: read\nour theatrical review about the detriment\nof alcohol.\nFor now, though, let us talk of \u201cpsychogeography\u201d. As exciting as it sounds, psy-chogeography creates playful, inventive\nstrategies for exploring new cities. That\nis, getting one off the beaten track, allowing oneself to be drawn into our environ-ment, meandering into the unknown and\ngoing with our spontaneity through the\nact of d\u00e9rive (drift).\nOne example of this is The Naked\nCity, a reconstructed guide to Paris featuring areas which its authors (Jorn and\nGuy Debord) felt had not been spoiled\nby capitalist redevelopments. Another\nexample is our weekly Tube Map, where\nwe hand-pick anyting from theatres to\nmuseums to book shops to parks. In this\nissue I have selected a few of London\u2019s\nmore pleasant and attractive parks . Perhaps on your ramblings you will embark\non an adventure you never thought possi-ble, meet your celebrity crush or even the\nmother/father of your children. If you are\ndissatisfied with the nature of the modern environment and want to make the\neveryday world more interesting look no\nfurther than Felix!\nSummer is a time for festivals, with\na plethora of them available. However,\nthe excessive crowds at many of them\nand pounding music may be a little off-putting. Extend your psychogeographi-cal jounrey outside London by taking in\nsome of this summer\u2019s more quirky op-purtunities such as the Secret Garden\nParty at the end of July. The theme this\nyear is \u2018Revolutions, past, present and future\u2019 where you are encouraged to take\npart in theatre, performing Shakespeare\naround fire circles, parades and much\nmore. With only 5000 capacity it promises to be a much more intimate alternative\nto some of the other gatherings. Equally\neccentric is the August-time Green Man\nfestival in Wales: psychedelic ramblings\n(?), literature and music from Super Furry\nanimals are some of the things going on.\nMore mainstream and closer to home\nis the Hampton Court Palace Festival\nthroughout June where you can enjoy\nconcerts and picnics at the same time..\nOur advice at Felix is to indulge yourself\nby buying a ticket to the festival of your\nchoice to keep the moral up until it\u2019s all\nover. No more exams? Buy one anyway!\nHans Rudi Giger is revealed\nGenius to some and a cause of offense to others. Caz Knight tries to scratch the\nsurface on one of the most important, albeit at times unheard of, artists of our time\nM\ny purpose, through\nthe medium of this\narticle and adjoining\npictures, is to convert you to the art,\nthe genius and pure astounding talent\nof H.R. Giger. \u201cArtist\u201d is a term that\ndoes not even scratch the surface of\nwhat Giger is and what he has done for\nmany dimensions of culture and fan-tasy, too. Painter, sculptor, architect,\ninnovator, genius, fantasist, creator of\ndreams and nightmares would come\na little closer to describing who he is,\nand yet still leaves much to be desired.\nHe is recognised as one of the world\u2019s\nforemost artists of Fantastic Realism,\nand fantastic is truly what his artwork\nis. \u201cFantastic realism\u201d: Giger brings\nfantasy to life and makes it so real one\nhas trouble believing his creations\nhave not existed, or do not exist some-where. The slightly oxymoronic nature\nof the phrase captures Giger himself\nbrilliantly: his work escapes definition\nby having a seemingly \u201csplit\u201d personality and this reinforces the beauty and\noriginality of his artistic endeavours.\nThe Swiss artist was born to chemist\nparents in Chur, Switzerland in 1940\nand had an educational grounding in\narchitecture and industrial design from\nthe School of Applied Arts, Zurich. His\nfather, when interviewed, remarked at\nhow a man with no knowledge of art\ncould bring into this world an artist\nof such immense talent. From science\ncomes art, and from art comes science:\nmany of Giger\u2019s works are a cause of\npure ecstasy to science-fiction fanat-ics. One of his most notable offerings,\nwhich transcends artistic disciplines,\nis his work on Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien\n(1979), cinematic masterpiece. Ridley\nScott was \u201cnever so sure on anything\nin my life\u201d when he saw Giger\u2019s third\n(and most famous) book Necronomicon (1977), which served as the inspirational fodder for the film in designing Alien as well as in the landscape\nof planet LV-426 where the crew first\nencounter the alien eggs. His work\nearned him the 1980 Oscar for Best\nAchievement in Visual Effects. However, it is saddening when the majority\nof fans of the film have not even heard\nof the mind and imagination behind its\nsuccess. Alien fans reading this; make\nit your business to educate yourself\non the man who is about to become\nyour favourite artist and \u201cdreamer of\ndreams\u201d.\nBegoetterung IX, acylic on paper (1979)\nGiger works his magic on top of Brian Aris\u2019 photo of Debbie Harry for\nher cover of Koo-Koo\nUnfortunately, the UK is not the best\nplace to go in search of Giger exhibi-tions. Culturally abundant in most other areas of art, the country lacks access\nto what artist Ernst Fuchs believes is\n\u201cone of the most important creators of\nfine art of our time\u201d. At present Giger\u2019s\nwork can be viewed in Vienna, New\nYork, Prague, Zurich (the artist\u2019s cur-Mutanten ink on transcop on wood (1967-8)\n\n"

It\u2019s a shame\nthat the sun has ducked\naway, leaving everybody\nbereft of her benevolence and sweet charms. You know\nwhat, who cares if the sun ain\u2019t shining\nno more, because at the end of the day,\nwe are talking about the British weather and when it comes to this, there are\nno surprises in store for any of us here.\nAt the back of my mind, I\u2019m thinking,\nhang on a minute, we still have f***ing\nimmense music to console ourselves\nwith. All is not lost. All is not lost.\nTwo weeks ago, I had the pleasure of\nattending Moby\u2019s new album launch\nparty at club Indig02 inside the O2\nArena. Moby performed a smashing DJ\nset, with guests Mylo and Trentemoller\nbrandishing their DJ dexterities alongside the master of electronics. With\n\u2018Last Night,\u2019 Moby grants us dance\nfloor killers; some would say he\u2019s back\nwith a vengeance, others are not so\nsure, this being the general consensus\namongst the critics. For me personally,\nI have to admit, I do prefer his old stuff,\nwith \u2018Play,\u2019 his sixth studio album still\nstanding strong as an unforgettable\nsensation. \u2018Last Night\u2019 does however\noffer us with a range of timeless tracks,\nfrom rave anthems, old school, cosmic\ndisco-pop, hip-hop, underground to\ndown-beat chiller ambience. You certainly can\u2019t say that Moby doesn\u2019t like\nto spice things up somewhat. Seemingly, \u2018Last Night\u2019 is a dance music tour\nde force to be reckoned with.\nThis week, there is an interview with\nCut/Copy who are prominent in the\nelctro-indie scene, as well as a catch-up\nwith Ty at Jazz Cafe and many singles\nthat need your undying attention!\nWe got a mountain of CDs sent to\nus over the holidays, and there\u2019s\nalways gigs that need going to. If\nyou fancy getting some free stuff,\ngive us an email at music.felix@\ngmail.com\nT\nhis trio from Melbourne,\nAustralia, are known for\ntheir dance/electropop,\ntaking influences from\npost punk genres as well\nas 80s new wave. A few weeks ago, Felix spoke to drummer Mitchell Scott to\nfind out a little about what makes these\nfellows cuting edge talent.\nYou\u2019ve got the full album \u2018In\nGhost Colours\u2019 on your MySpace\npage. Why did you decide to do\nthat?\nI think that was actually something our\nlabel did. For us, we just want people to\nhere the music really so it\u2019s good as far\nas we\u2019re concerned. I think it doesn\u2019t\nstay up there for ever, maybe it\u2019s up for\na couple of weeks around the release\ndate of the record and then it\u2019s pulled\nback down to the regular number of\nsongs. But the label doesn\u2019t mind, and\nif they don\u2019t care, we don\u2019t care.\nWhat are the main differences\nbetween the new album \u2018In Ghost\nColours\u2019 and your debut \u2018Bright\nLike Neon Love\u2019?\nWe just kept doing what we\u2019re doing\nreally. It\u2019s been a little while since our\nlast record so maybe our tastes have\nchanged and we might have been subtly influenced.\nI guess one of the main things though\nis that we had more time to spend in\nthe studio working on the record so it\u2019s\nprobably a little more developed in that\nsense. And we\u2019ve also come a long way\nin how we play music in that we\u2019d never been a band before the last record.\nIt was all totally new to us really \u2013 we\nbarely knew how to play our instruments \u2013 so maybe we\u2019ve come along in\nthat sense as well. With the first record,\nwe only had half a day in the studio to\nrecord the live elements, and there was\nalso some dodgy bedroom recording.\nThis time we had about six weeks in\nthe studio.\nWhat kind of music were you listening to when you were writing\nthe album?\nLoads of stuff, I mean you have your\nold favourites that you always come\nback to. I guess this time there was a bit\nmore psychedelic electronic stuff, like\nTangerine Dream, Krautrock, things\nlike that. Things like Animal Collective, Sleepy Jackson.\nHow have you seen the \u2018Indie\nElectro\u2019 scene progress since the\nrelease of your debut?\nIt\u2019s definitely come along like crazy.\nWhen we made that record there\nwasn\u2019t really a scene for what we were\ndoing at all. Our first record sold nothing much, although gradually people\nbecame aware of it and started coming\nto our shows. But this album debuted\nat number one, so there\u2019s a pretty large\ndifference. The scene\u2019s grown to a huge\nextent.\nWhere do you see it going in the\nfuture?\nThere\u2019s a lot of different ways you can\ngo with it. We\u2019ve gone for a bit more\nof a live, more guitar-driven direction,\nbut there\u2019s other bands doing really\nwell who are going in a much more\ndance floor friendly direction.\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to say \u2013 a\nscene is usually made up of people\nwho aren\u2019t really conscious of being\npart of a scene. Ideally it\u2019s just a lot of\npeople doing their own thing which\ngets lumped together to a certain ex-tent. But for us, we just try to not be\ntoo conscious about what\u2019s going on\naround us and just try and make music\nwhich we care about.\nWhat kind of bands are there\naround at the moment that you\u2019re\nlistening to?\nThere\u2019s always quite a bit of stuff.\nWe\u2019re going on tour with Black Kids,\nI think they\u2019re quite cool. The Presets\nhave just got a new record out. Ladyhawk, Joakim who just did a remix for\nus, Nightlife. It\u2019s just across the board, I\nlike a pretty broad range of music.\nAre you playing at any festivals\nthis year?\nYeah, definitely. I\u2019m not sure which\nones. We\u2019re looking at all the offers and\nlocking them in at the moment, but we\ndon\u2019t actually know which ones we\u2019re\nplaying at. People have been saying to\nus \u201cOh, I see you\u2019re playing at this festival later in the year\u201d and we actually\u2026\ndon\u2019t know. We\u2019re definitely going to\nbe playing at some summer festivals\nthough, I can\u2019t wait to get back to that.\nHow do you find your music is\nreceived at festivals as opposed\nto clubs or smaller venues?\nIt can be really good, there\u2019s a lot of energy at festivals. People are there with\na definite aim to enjoy themselves so\nwe can often get the crowd involved.\nWhen that happens it\u2019s really cool.\nThere\u2019s a different kind of vibe at festivals \u2013 you\u2019re playing to people who\nmight not necessarily come to your\nown show. It\u2019s a large new audience,\nand it\u2019s often there that people find out\nabout new music. People who go to see\nyou might not have heard your music\nbefore, or they might have just heard\na song on the radio, so they may not\nbe people who\u2019d like to hear some obscure track from your back catalogue.\nWe\u2019d probably play some of our better\nknown stuff or more recent stuff.\nIt took you a while to find a producer for the new album, eventually settling on Tim Goldsworthy.\nWhat was it about him that made\nyou want to work with him?\nWe\u2019ve got a very healthy respect for\nPSA and pretty much everything\nthey\u2019ve done. More recently they\u2019ve\nbeen taking their remixes and production and putting a more psychedelic\nbent on things, and Tim\u2019s good at that\nas well. He\u2019s drawn out like ten minute\ncosmic synth epics, we really liked\neverything that he had his hands in up\nuntil now. Having conversations with\nhim, he really seemed to get where the\nmusic was coming from. He could pull\nout the key references and was bang on\nwith everything he had to say about the\nrecord \u2013 where it\u2019s coming from and\nsome of the things he though he could\ndo with it. Getting over there and getting on with the process, we became\neven more happy with the decision. We\nhave a really good working relationship\nwith him. A surprising fun fact is that\nhe dropped out of high school to follow\naround My Bloody Valentine on tour,\nso he really took to a lot of the guitar\ndriven songs which was not what we\nexpected, we though he would be more\ninto the disco dancey stuff as opposed\nto the guitar songs.\nCut/Copy all adorning copycat smug expressions... could they be clones of one another?\nThis photo was taken moments before some gnarly dude grinded the\nphat rail on the right taking the young man\u2019s head clean off\n\n"

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFriday 23 May 2008 felix\nComment\nI\nenjoy ranting, but normally I\ndon\u2019t feel the need to publish it.\nIn this case, however, I make an\nexception.\nIn spite of the fact that the\nphoto to my left makes me look despicably smug and that I am slowly, but\nundeniably, losing my hair, I have a\ngirlfriend. She (rather selfishly, I might\nadd) decided to get an education at Oxford University. I now have the gross\nmisfortune to need to travel there. I\ndon\u2019t have anything against Oxford or\nmy girlfriend (for the most part) but\nhaving to get the train ranks in enjoyment somewhere between smallpox\nand drowning in your own excrement.\nIf I may, esteemed readers, I should\nlike to construct a ridiculously over-elaborate metaphor to explain my last\nexperience on the trains. Most trains to\nOxford look, sound and feel as if they\nwere put together by a one-legged,\nno-handed man, who has lost several\namateur arse-kicking contests. He has,\nhowever, come back for that one final\nattemptatthe\u201cbigtime\u201dbeforeretiring.\nIn a completely unpredictable twist, he\nhas had to remortgage his house to pay\nfor his grandchildren\u2019s education as his\nson and daughter in law were killed in\na tragically comic accident involving\nDidcot Parkway station and some Brie.\nDue to an ill-advised option from the\nbuffet cart on the free train journeys\nhe gets (in an insulting reminder of the\nlack of any real pension) to the compe-tition, he has suffered a poorly-timed\nbout of explosive diarrhoea. As you\ncan imagine, the rubbery cheese they\nput in those sandwiches doesn\u2019t make\nfor particularly abrasive faeces, and\nso slipping on his remaining leg, his\nface implodes for some reason I cannot back up with conventional medical\nscience. Finally, in a last act of revenge,\nhe uses what he has left of his distem-pered, mutilated body to bludgeon the\nremainder of the train together and\nsends it off to the depot.\nHaving now sold you on the idea of\ntrain travel, I\u2019m giving you some firsthand advice on how to make your journey bearable.\n1) Take a deckchair and some duct\ntape.\nAs we all know, you will be unlikely to find a seat anywhere. Your seat\nreservation means about as much as\nsensible transport policies do to Boris\nJohnson. Apparently, according to the\nconditions of travel (and this is actually true), your ticket entitles you to get\nfrom A to B; it doesn\u2019t guarantee you\na seat, the ability to move, or even the\navailability of oxygen. If you can manage to find a seat, use your deckchair\ninstead. The train seats are for some\nreason designed so that you cannot\nsit in any non-sciatica-inducing posi-tion, whereas any slight movement on\nthe \u201ccushion\u201d will tear you a new set of\nhaemorrhoids. Hence the duct tape \u2013\neither tape them back in or strap yourself to the roof and pray to whatever\nor whoever you want that there are no\nlow bridges.\n2) Don\u2019t play the Generation Game.\nIf you are waiting to use the toilet facilities on the train to avoid paying the\n20p at the station, I sincerely suggest\npaying as an astute investment. Thanks\nto the Disability Discrimination Act,\nall trains now have these ridiculous\ngameshow toilets. Featuring some\nkind of star trek door is all very well\nand good, but not when the buttons\nmean bugger all. I discovered it\u2019s not\nenough to close the door; apparently\nyou need to be acquainted with bomb\ndisposal to press the correct combination of buttons to lock the damn thing.\nIf you don\u2019t, then you and everything\nyou are doing are revealed as the sorry,\nnaked prize of the next unsuspecting\npassenger wanting to use the toilet a la\nthe cuddly toy on the generation game.\nThis can create unprecedented levels\nof awkwardness, but if you can watch\nthis happen to someone else it\u2019s a nice\nway of forgetting what a crap place you\nhave found yourself in.\n3) The train staff are your enemy.\nI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that I\nfelt like I was being treated as a terrorist in an American internment camp.\nWhen the world\u2019s most incompetent\noaf had attempted to lie to us about\nhow we would shortly be on our way\nseveral times, he made the decision\nto leave his microphone on. We were\nthen treated every 3 minutes to large\nbursts of ear-piercing white noise\nwhich I assume was interference and\nnot an attempt to get us to confess to\nspurious national security charges,\nbut they could have quite easily been\nconfused. My fellow passengers and I\ntried to make light of the situation with\nsome bemused eye contact. Although\nit was comforting to know that I wasn\u2019t\nthe only one on the path to complete\ninsanity I nonetheless felt ripped off at\nhaving to actually pay for sleep depri-vation. Out of interest, I\u2019d love to know\nwhat kind of assessment centres these\npeople attend for these jobs; somewhere along the line lying and inducing mental health issues in passengers\nbecame measureable skills.\nThe buffet and its consequences\nhave already been alluded to, but suffice to say that if you try to associate\nthe terms \u201ctrain buffet\u201d and \u201cfood hygiene,\u201d the universe will implode.\n4) Be ruthless.\nSell your fellow passengers down the\nriver. The atmosphere on a train is always tense, helped along by the gentle\nbut frequent reminder of impending\ndeath and the necessity of watching\nfor any \u201csuspicious bags or behaviour.\u201d\nSeeing as the train-operating companies are attempting to create a police\nstate, why not use this to your advantage and try reporting that guy in the\nseat opposite you to the guard? Before\nyou know it, he will be removed without warning and may be destroyed,\nleaving you to return your legs to a\nsemi-natural position.\n5) If you value your digestive tract,\nI reiterate that the buffet cart is a bad\nchoice.\nTo conclude, I highly recommend\ntrain travel if you enjoy unexplained\ndelays, poor service and intestinal dys-function. Otherwise, walk to your des-tination, even if it is the other end of\nthe country; it will still be far less pain-ful. I don\u2019t expect, nor really want, anything to change though. A little part of\nme lights up inside when I see that everyone can adopt that famed stiff upper\nlip, as it would be a shame for people\nto actually complain. That would be\ncrazy, because someone might try and\nfix it, and we can\u2019t have that.\nJaimie Henry\nWelcome to Purgatory, next stop Hell\nA. Geek\nWelcome to Purgatory, next stop Hell 2\n\u201c\nNothing can\nmake it any less\nweird \u2013 I shouted\nat someone in\npublic\nI\ncame close to assaulting someone this week. I\u2019m not a violent\nperson, as the wife-beaters say,\nbut I actually managed to lose\nit sufficiently on the Tube during the rush hour to shout at a woman\nas she flailed around on the edge of a\nVictoria Line train. If you were there,\nwearing a trenchcoat and acting like\na tosser, just be glad your ridiculous\nhairstyle made it home intact.\nI\u2019m not bringing that up because I\nthink violence is great fun, or a facet\nof manliness, though it might well turn\nout to be. I\u2019m bringing it up because I\nwas actually a little disgusted with myself that I managed to shout Captain\nInept down as she fought desperately\nto delay me in every way she could.\nYes, she was hanging onto the top of\nthe train so as not to step off the train\nwhile others were leaving. Yes, I was\nhaving thoughts of genocide. Yes, there\nwas some pisskidney trying to barge\ninto the train at the same time, despite\nthe obvious trouble I was having with\nthe hair-wearing freak. But nothing\ncan make it any less weird \u2013 I shouted\nat someone in public.\nReflection and confession can go\nscrew themselves on an island holiday in the Med, however, because as\nmuch as I\u2019d love to go on about how\nit made me think about the role of\nanger in modern society, my day trip\nonly progressed to get worse as I journeyed along the District Line towards\nthe ominously-tennis-less Wimbledon\nstation. I\u2019d been standing up for all of\nthirty seconds when four suits barged\nin, inserting all manner of leather-clad\nobjects into my back and talking loudly\non their mobiles phones in broad Scottish accents. What was worse was that,\nas the journey went on, I was increasingly under the impression that the\npeople they were phoning were actually on the same carriage.\nAt this point, I came to the realisation\nthat we\u2019re taking the knife-crime thing\nin the wrong direction. Having knife\nbarriers and the like is a total waste of\ntime \u2013 instead, have knife dispensers.\nJust give everyone on the Tube a knife\naround the time of rush hour, and you\nsolve most problems. First of all, you\u2019ve\ngot a level playing field right off the\nbat. If Old Man War Veteran has a flick\nknife as well then everyone\u2019s on the\nsame page when it comes to confron-tations. It also means I can slit throats\nwith gay abandon without feeling too\nbad that I was attacking essentially defenceless members of the public.\nBest of all, though, is that it removes\nthe culture of knives altogether. Instead\nof being something cool, they\u2019re really\nordinary. As soon as the middle-aged\npricks are whipping out whetstones\non the Northern Line services each\nevening, it\u2019ll become really boring and\nsuddenly the London Lite sudoku will\nseem edgy, and rule-breaking.\nReverse psychology \u2013 the approach\nof kings and the king of approaches?\nThis might mean that I\u2019m a violent\nperson at heart after all, or it might\njust mean that I get extremely angry\n\u201c\nMost trains\nto Oxford feel\nas if they were\nput together by\na one-legged,\nno-handed man,\nwho has lost\nseveral amateur\narse-kicking\ncontests\n\u201d\nabout things like this. The wanderers,\nthe meanderers, the uppity, five-o-clock pillocks who clog up every right\nof way they can \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that\ngang violence is borne out of frustration incurred on public transport, but\nit wouldn\u2019t surprise me if sometimes\nthose armed youths weep for the children of tomorrow and the stressful\nmorning commutes they may have to\nendure. I like that idea. It makes them\nless intimidating when they\u2019re drunkenly swaying around Seven Sisters at\nthree in the morning.\nAnyway, that\u2019s basically my manifesto for 2012. Recruiting campaigners\nnow \u2013 CVs on a digestive biscuit to the\nusual address.\nWay out... Mind the door doesn\u2019t hit your arse, trenchcoat woman\n\n"

One of the more remarkable polling figures in\nKentucky has shown that two-thirds of Clinton\u2019s voters\nwould prefer to see McCain in office, rather than Obama.\nFears of a united Republican party eventually defeating\na Democratic party in disarray seem ever more realistic.\nBack to the Table\nIsrael/Syria\nFor the first time since 2000, Israel and Syria are holding\npeace talks. Mediated by Turkish Prime Minister Recep\nErdogan, spokesmen from both governments have now\nconfirmed that negotiations are underway. The two\ncountries have officially been at war since 1967, when\nIsrael captured the Golan Heights during the Six-Day\nWar. Experts say that Syria will be asking for a return\nof the heights, a demand that led to the breakdown of\nthe talks eight years ago. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud\nOlmert appears to be willing to agree to the withdrawal,\nbut is likely to insist on Syria\u2019s cutting its links to Iran,\nHezbollah and other militant groups in the area.\nI\nreceived a well-placed criticism last week with regards\ntominorinaccuraciesonthe\naid response to the China\nearthquake.

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n20 Friday 23 May 2008\nfelix\nArts\nIt is an Evening of Wonders indeed\nMustapher Botchway experiences a night of suspended boxes, mind reading and twin gorillas\nT\nhis guy/thing/alien/weir-do needs no introduction,\nfor seeing his acts on the\ntelevision should tell you\nhe/it is something special.\nMonday 12 May was the day a couple of\nfriends and I went to see Derren Brown\nperform Mind Reader: An evening of\nWonders at the cosy Garrick theatre.\nThe aimless and farfetched postulating\nof what subliminal messages Brown\ncould have planted on the tube and in\nour newspapers was probably a signal\nthat we had let Brown mania consume\nus even before the show started.\nHowever, more intriguing was the\nmysterious-looking box suspended in\nmid air: More on that later. The show\nstarted in great fashion, fooling sixty\npercent of the audience within two\nminutes. The phenomenon of Change\nBlindness and not magic was used in\nthis instance. I shan\u2019t bore you with the\ndetails (it was a psychological study)\nbut the aforementioned sixty percent\ncould not notice a pair of table tennis\nplayers exchange places with a couple\nof gorillas. (\u2018Wiki\u2019 it!) And all this before Brown had appeared. Good use of\nforty pounds then.\nThe act itself was nothing short of\nbrilliant. More so, a refreshing retreat\ntowards the early Brown work, mental-ism. I sense he is taking a break from\ntelevision, which he regards as \u201cfatuous\u201d and \u201cless fun\u201d. Indeed one detects\nthis lack of passion in the second series\nof Channel 4\u2019s Trick or Treat. Like this\nnewspaper, the new series has flirted\non a more sensationalist approach,\nwith the \u2018will she or will she not kill the\ncute kitten\u2019 and the upcoming \u2018ambush\u2019\nepisode highlighting such views. Nevertheless it should still not be missed.\nWithout giving the act away, Brown\nmanaged to \u2018mind read\u2019 the words six\npeople were thinking of. And no, they\nwere not \u2018cat\u2019, \u2018dog\u2019, \u2018house\u2019 or \u2018mouse\u2019.\nThe serial number of a ten pound note\nwas also \u2018guessed\u2019 by the father of one\nof the audience. As could be expected,\nanother example of Change Blindness\nwas performed by Derren Brown and\nhis \u2018twin gorilla\u2019 before the interval,\nfooling almost everyone this time.\nOne of Brown\u2019s endearing qualities is\nhis scepticism of the paranormal. He\nopenly admits what he does are tricks\nand he has not been bestowed with an\narsenal of abilities by Tom Cruise or\nanybody else from Planet Glong. The\ntable turning exercise demonstrated\nthis view.\nHaving seen a multitude of his television shows I have longed to become\nthe subject of one of his tricks, just so I\ncan use my alleged intelligent mind to\noutwit him. In spite of this, it was my\nfriendwhoreceivedthisprivilege(mind\nfuck). Before the interval Brown asked\nfor two hundred volunteers to submit\na personal question into an opaque en-velope, with only their initials and seat\nnumber on the visible side. This was in\npreparation for Brown\u2019s re-enactment\nof a magnificent trick, first performed\nin the 1920\u2019s.\nThe customary embellishment and\nconvolution preceded the trick with\nBrown wrapping himself in hospital\nbandages to facilitate the seeing of the\naudience\u2019s words and not their faces,\nas well as the disregarding of about one\nhundred and eighty envelopes as the\nfeel of their handwritten initials was\nnot \u2018right\u2019. He correctly guessed that a\nnineteen year old woman had suffered\nan alcohol-induced kidney infection\nafter a heavy night out drinking (on a\nWednesday, in dB\u2019s perhaps?). Another answer to one of the two hundred\nquestions was that a forty three year\nold man had once had his ear almost\ntorn off by a fishing line. More fascinating was that Brown had correctly\npredicted the same guy had recently\narrived back in the UK from a flight.\nThis was not in the envelope.\nTo further convolve the trick he asked\nthe audience, whilst still covered in\nbandages, to think of a fact about\nthem and \u2018aim\u2019 them towards his chest.\nBrown then asked a twenty year old\nmale sitting in the dress circle to stand\nup. The sudden rush of blood to my\nhead subsided when this guy\u2019s name\nhad to begin with the letter A. My\nfriend, engrossed in aiming his fact\ntowards Brown\u2019s chest had not noticed\nthat he fitted this profile prior to my\nD to the erren Brown himself. Legend polite nudge. The trick continued after\nanother member of the audience from\nthe dress circle was identified. Brown,\namazingly or not, predicted that they\nboth had a pet; that both pet\u2019s names\nbegan with \u2018sh\u2019; that the pets were a\ncat and a dog. Finally, and extraordi-narily, he had correctly identified that\nthe cat and dog were called Shelley and\nShadow respectively. I will leave you to\nguess which donut decided to call their\ndog after an optical phenomenon.\nThis left my friends and me awestruck,\nto the applause of the rest of the audi-ence. This ended the show. Now the\nbox suspended in mid-air. Brown performed yet another trick in the encore\nto select the \u2018most psychic\u2019 member of\nthe audience. The lady then opened the\nbox and revealed a scroll with a collection of words, apparently written by\nBrown forty five minutes prior to the\nshow. The words included some of the\nwords that the six people had thought\nof, and other notable words and objects from the show. Extraordinarily,\ncompleting the scroll were the words\n\u2018lady, long blond hair, grey trousers\u2019.\nIndeed this was a fitting description of\nthe lady holding the scroll. And on that\nnote we were shown the door.\nThe show was astounding and for the\nthree days following it, my revision\nhad ceased and my mind was focussed\non working out how each astonishing\ntrick was performed.\nIndeed I seem to have deciphered most\nof the tricks, but it is still a privilege to\nwatch this guy use \u2018magic, suggestion,\npsychology, misdirection and showmanship\u2019 to perform his tricks in real\nlife. I certainly was one of the 100% of\npeople who were eventually fooled in\nhis show.\nAt forty odd pounds for the best seats,\nit is not cheap. However, the Garrick is\na relatively small theatre and I envisage those paying \u00a330 for upper circle\nseats not suffering a great deal. It is\ndefinitely value for money as the two\nhour performance is full of tricks, audience participation, flashes of comedy\nand is definitely more captivating than\nwatching him on TV.\nA selection of Derren Brown\u2019s portraits. For the extra-keen, you can buy prints from his website\nDerren doesn\u2019t just come in disturbing monochromatic shades, honest\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nFriday 23 May 2008 felix\nPolitics\nbeing a Class C drug.\nI agree, and think that just emphasises\nthe fact that this appears to have been\na political decision.\nSince cannabis was declassified,\nhas there been a change in drug\nculture?\nUse has gone down; there has been a\nlong term fall in use. You could say it\nhas gone down because of the declas-sification, people thinking it is not as\ngood. I wonder if it is partly education.\nAlso maybe skunk is less pleasant to\ntake. Maybe it is because less people\nsmoke, it\u2019s harder to take cannabis\nwithout smoking so reduction in smoking could mean a reduction in cannabis\nuse. Cocaine use is increasing. I don\u2019t\nthink there is necessarily a link but it\nis a possibility. Fashion is probably the\nbiggest influence on drug use. Maybe\npeople want to be different from their\nsiblings. If your brother smokes dope\nand you want to be different, you take\ncoke. To some extent cannabis use may\nbe becoming \u201cuncool\u201d.\nDo you think there is a place in\nsociety for alcohol, tobacco and\nother, illegal drugs?\nDrugs are drugs and they ought to be\ntreated fairly as far as possible instead\nof the peculiar position we are in today.\nTobacco is a very interesting example;\ntobacco use has fallen quite a lot, driven by public dislike for smoking and\nthe smoking ban in buildings. I think\nif you want to stop drugs being used\nit helps to make them unfashionable.\nThere are other ways, e.g. taxation, and\none of the problems with illegal drugs,\nas you know, is you don\u2019t have access to\nsuch proven methods of control. Most\ncountries in the world have accepted\nthat taking drugs is a personal choice\nand that we should not penalise people for drug use but dealers should be\npunished for selling drugs. I am quite\ninterested in the Dutch model where\ncannabis is available in coffee shops\nlegally in a controlled fashion in a safe\nenvironment. I think it\u2019s a very interesting idea and I don\u2019t know why other\ncountries haven\u2019t explored it as a way\nof protecting kids who want to try cannabis from street dealers of other harder drugs. That type of approach might\nhave some benefits.\nCan you see it working for other\ndrugs?\nIt potentially could. It is an interesting\napproach that should be explored as an\noption.\nRecommendation 7 advises\nschools to develop policies relating to substance abuse. Do you\nsee this including universities?\nWhen we talk about that we talk about\neducation establishments including\nuniversities. I think they should have\nexplicit policies on all drugs and that\nshould include alcohol. Alcohol probably does more damage to students\u2019 progression than cannabis. They should\nbe educating kids but also encouraging\nthem to seek help if they get into prob-lems. I think kicking people out is, particularly at schools, a hugely dangerous\nthing to do. Once kids are kicked out\nof school what else have they got to do\nBUT take drugs? I think it\u2019s disproportionate to exclude people from university for taking drugs. If you applied it\nfairly, then you\u2019d exclude most people.\nEven this government now has a policy\nof harm minimisation so that\u2019s what\neducation establishments should try\nto do, to make sure that whatever they\ndo doesn\u2019t cause more harm than the\ndrugs. That\u2019s absolutely the first rule.\nIf you could start from scratch\nwith alcohol and tobacco, would\nthey be illegal and if so, which\nclass would you put them in?\nThere\u2019s no question. Alcohol is similar\nto GHB, currently class C. But in the\nLancet paper, alcohol comes up with a\nlot of other class B drugs. Tobacco is\nprobably C because it doesn\u2019t actually\ncause damage through intoxication\nlike alcohol, the main costs\nare health costs to the people\nwho smoke it and it is addictive.\nIn the report, cannabis\nis said to be less\nphysically harmful\nthan tobacco.\nWhat are the\nreasons for\nthis?\nIt is actually quite complex. The main\nreason is lifetime consumption of cannabis is much less than tobacco con-sumption. So people generally smoke\nbetween 3 and 6 joints a day as opposed to up to 40 to 60 cigarettes a day\nso there is actually less consumption.\nBut harm per inhalation is harder to\nknow: I wouldn\u2019t have thought there\u2019s\nmuch in it frankly, they\u2019re all toxic substances that are burnt. Actually, cannabis burns at a lower temperature\nso probably slightly less toxic per unit\ninhalation.\nAre there any psychological or\nbiological reasons for the prevalence of cannabis in certain age\ngroups?\nThat\u2019s an interesting question. We\ndon\u2019t really know why people stop using cannabis in their 30s. It\u2019s one of the\nresearch questions that needs addressing now. Why do some kids use can-nabis? I think many want an alternative\nto alcohol, they don\u2019t want to be out of\ntheir head, they want to be mellow. In\nmany ways it\u2019s a very sensible choice.\nYou have slightly more control over\nyour life than if blind drunk. Why do\npeople give up? I would like to know.\nI don\u2019t know if the law has much of an\nimpact. I think some people get paranoid when they smoke more. Maybe\nyou can ask your readers who have\ngiven up cannabis,\nwhy did they stop?\nIs there a medical reason\nwhy taking cannabis should affect job prospects? For exam-ple, Boris Johnson is known to\nhave been a drug user.\nWell I think this is a really interesting question that has never been\ndiscussed in relation to drugs. It\u2019s\nbeen discussed in relation to al-cohol; should reformed alcoholics\nbe allowed to take public office? Boris\ndoes seem to have used a range of drugs\npossibly including Class A ones. Jacqui Smith and many other cabinet and\nshadow cabinet ministers have smoked\ncannabis. That\u2019s why I think this whole\nbusiness of penalties is ridiculous. If\nfor instance, the current Home Secretary had been caught in possession of\na joint when a student and then got a\ncriminal record, she almost certainly\nwouldn\u2019t now be Home Secretary. As\nshe\u2019s potentially quite a good Home\nSecretary this would have been a waste\nof talent. It\u2019s quite pointless to lose\nyour opportunity to fulfil your talents\nfor such a minor transgression. I think\ndrug use \u2013 including alcohol - gener-allly doesn\u2019t impinge on people\u2019s func-tionng if they\u2019re not dependent or misusing the drug currently.\nAre there long term physical effects on the brain from cannabis\nuse?\nIt does change the brain but it doesn\u2019t\nappear to damage the brain. That\u2019s true\nof any addiction, addictions change the\nbrain in the sense that you behave dif-ferently. In general drugs don\u2019t physically kill brain cells but they do change\nthe chemistry of the brain. Everything\nyou do changes your brain, this conversation has changed your brain.\nThere is no evidence of irreversible\nchanges with cannabis. With meth-amphetamines, alcohol and cocaine,\nthere may be long term changes after\ndependence which means you can argue that addiction lasts forever. But\nwhether you really get addicted to cannabis in the same way as to alcohol or\nheroin is actually quite an interesting\nquestion. I\u2019m not sure you do. We don\u2019t\nknow whether aging \u201cdope heads\u201d still\ncrave cannabis. There is withdrawal\nand physical dependence, no question\nabout that but cannabis doesn\u2019t seem\nto control people\u2019s lives in the same\nway as heroin and alcohol.\nThe report states that \u201cto prevent\none case of schizophrenia in men\naged 20 to 24, about 5,000 men\nwould have to be prevented from\never smoking cannabis\u201d. How\nstrong is the link between cannabis use and schizophrenia?\nThereisalinkbutit\u2019sweak.Ithinkthere\nmust be some genetic sensitivity. Anyone can get psychotic just like anyone\ncan get drunk but schizophrenia is dif-ferent. We suggested in the report that\nthe enzyme COMT might be a common cause because COMT is weakly\nlinked to schizophrenia and weakly\nlinked to cannabis psychosis. The\nweakness of the\nlink of cannabis\nand schizophrenia is\nwhy the move to class\nB is not proportional to\nthe harm of cannabis. The\nimpact on schizophrenia of stopping\neveryone smoking cannabis would be\nrelatively trivial. We shouldn\u2019t be inappropriately penalising cannabis users\n- even locking them up - to stop other\npeople getting schizophrenia, which is\nof course what some hard liners sug-ggest. Arguing that stopping cannabis\nuse will stop people getting schizophrenia is quite wrong.\nAccording to a study by Frisher\nand Crome, there has been a\ndecrease in schizophrenia in\nthe past 10 years. However, the\nTelegraph reported that mental\nhealth hospital admissions due\nto cannabis have risen by 65% in\nthe past 5 years. How true is this\nevaluation?\nSchizophrenia is slowly disappearing.\nCannabis really doesn\u2019t cause schizophrenia but it can make schizophrenia\nworse. If you\u2019ve got schizophrenia and\nsmoke cannabis, you are going to stay\npsychotic. So it doesn\u2019t help if you are\nschizophrenic and I think that\u2019s what\nthe issue of cannabis and schizophrenia is about, if you\u2019re schizophrenic\nand go and get stoned then you get admitted to hospital because you become\nmore psychotic. So it\u2019s not about causing schizophrenia, it\u2019s about making it\nharder to treat. We don\u2019t know if there\nis a reverse causal link, there is some\nevidence that schizophrenics like can-nabis. It may be helpful to them, perhaps moderating the voices and other\npsychotic symptoms. We don\u2019t have\nenough evidence.\nMarjorie Wallace of Sane was\nquoted as saying: \u201cUrgent action\nis needed to prevent an epidemic\nof drug induced psychosis\u201d. Is\nthis an over exaggeration?\nThere is no evidence of anything\nchanging. They are all just facets of the\nsame fear. It is possible that next year\nsuddenly the evidence will change. But\nright now there is no good evidence to\nsupport what she said.\nThroughout the report the\nsimilarity in severity of effects\nbetween cannabis and Class C\ndrugs was drawn out. Based on\npurely medical and scientific evi-dence, should cannabis be a Class\nC drug?\nIt should, yes. Based on the medical evidence it should definitely be Class C.\n\u201cArguing that\nstopping\ncannabis use\nwill prevent\nschizophrenia is\nquite wrong\u201d\n\u201cBased on\nthe medical\nevidence,\n[cannabis]\nshould definitely\nbe class C\u201d\nDespite Recommendation 3, the government chose to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug\n\n"

    "content": "music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n25\nFriday 23 May 2008 felix\nMusic\nMiddle of the road tunes\nfrom Royworld and Pigeons\nThese guys formed at Goldsmiths College back in 2006, the London quartet\nare tipped to conquer the music industry in 2008 and beyond, currently venturing into the music scene with their\nsecond single: \u2018Dust.\u2019\nPinched from Royworld\u2019s forthcoming debut album \u2018Man In The Machine,\u2019\nto be released on 2nd June, \u2018Dust\u2019 is an\neasy number to locate on the musical\nbarometer. As far as the soundscape is\nconcerned, Royworld\u2019s memorably layered keyboard driven melody, soaring\nguitar lines, thumping drums, along\nwith frontman Rod Futrille\u2019s crooning\nvocals will easily entice old fans and\nnewcomers alike.\nThe song is definitely crafted in a\nhighly sophisticated manner and one\ncertainly gets the impression of the\nband\u2019s confidence through the way\nin which everything is put together,\nstrangely, an epic, dynamic feel suffuses this track.\nDust is a paradigm of Royworld\u2019s immensely fine songwriting talent. One\nto watch out in the future.\nSusan Yu\nRoyworld\nDust\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nWe are Scientists\u2019 new single has been\nhailed as \u2018a wave of pure charm...\nf*cking awesome\u2019 by NME. Couldn\u2019t\nagree more!\nThis emotionally charged stormer\ntaken from their chart topping second album \u2019Brain Thrust Mastery\u2019 that\nplunged into the UK Album charts at\nnumber 11, sees the duo sizzling with\ndeliciously raw, edgy sound, a concoction of sirenesque melodies, roofrock-eting vocals, thrashing drums and\nguitar franticness. The wholesome picture of indie rock and roll. Mind you,\nthe video for \u2018Chick Lit\u2019 is worthy of\nWe Are Scientists\nChick Lit\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nIs this really an emergency?\nThe Pigeon Detectives certainly\nclaims so with their new single from\ntheir novel album \u2018Emergency.\u2019\nIt seems that bands aren\u2019t immune to\nthe \u201cbus law\u201d either. You wait ages and\ntwo come along at once: noisy guitars,\nfast paced hi-hat rhythms, and simple\nshouty choruses; and I can\u2019t help but\nfeel The Wombats do it just that little\nbit better. The momentum of the track\ncarries you through to the riff-rich\nchorus and the singer\u2019s continuous reiteration of how urgent the situation\nis. It\u2019s the kind of infectious song that\nwill probably get a reasonable amount\nof Radio 1 airplay, but I\u2019m not sure\nwhether it has enough sustenance or\noriginality to make it last beyond a few\nweeks.\nIf you\u2019re after a loud sing-a-long\ntrack and liked their previous songs,\nsuch as I Found Out, then this might\nbe for you. However it\u2019s a simple song,\nwith a simple outcome: all right.\nStuart Higgins\nThe Pigeon Detectives\nThis is an emergency\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nAfter a three-year gap, Coldplay are\nback with their latest offering \u2013 Viva\nLa Vida or Death And All His Friends\n\u2013 and if their new single is anything to\ngo by, it might not be too bad either.\nViolet Hill is the first single to be released off the album and is a rousing\nintroduction, with reverb-laden vocals\nand thick electric guitars. You might\nbe forgiven for thinking \u201cOasis\u201d when\nfirst hearing the track, and whilst it\u2019s\ndefinitely Coldplay, there is something\noddly reminiscent of the Mancunian\nband in the overall sound. It\u2019s a far better offering than their last lead single,\n2005\u2019s Speed of Sound, which was essentially their 2002 hit Clocks with a\nslightly re-phrased piano riff.\nSinger Chris Martin leads us through\na tumultuous journey of snow and ri-fle-wielding priests, interspersed with\nthe lyrical hook \u201cIf you love me, won\u2019t\nyou let me know?\u201d I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 I\u2019m\nstill trying to understand what he\u2019s going on about, but in reality it doesn\u2019t\nmatter. It works, and you soon find\nyourself singing along.\nColdplay\nViolet Hill\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nT\nake any stereotypical impressions of a rapper and\ncast them aside when you\nthink of Ty, arguably one\nof the most underrated\nartists of his genre in the UK. Notably\nabsent from his three albums, released\nwith the pioneering hip-hop label Big\nDada, are the obnoxious bragging, delinquent potty-mouth, and paranoid,\nyawn-some obsession with \u2018the haters\u2019\nthat seem to blight the majority of his\npeers. In place of all this we find an\nupbeat, soul-and-jazz-inspired blend\nof thoughtful hip-hop that you find\nyourself tapping your foot and smiling\nas your head nods along in contented\nagreement.\nHis lyrics are pensive yet witty, mature while retaining a refreshing element of playfulness. Neither is he\nafraid to dabble in the political, drawing references to topics ranging from\nthe 1994 Rwandan genocide to the\nmurder of the young Damilola Taylor.\nIndeed, his long and active involvement in London\u2019s poetry and spoken-word scene provide further testament\nto his wordsmithery.\nHis live performances don\u2019t disappoint either. Whether performing with\na full live band or DJ, Ty establishes\na rapport early on with the crowd\nthrough his energy and humour. At the\nJazz Caf\u00e9 in Camden, he was joined by\nnot only a DJ, but also welcomed to\nthe stage an R&B singer, a soul singer,\nBritish and Nigerian rappers and even\na lad playing the harmonica over the\nhip-hop beats. Even the DJ couldn\u2019t\nresist stopping the records and joining\nTy in some impressive beat-boxing.\n\u2018It\u2019s all about people having a good\ntime\u2019 said Ty after the gig. \u2018I want\npeople to enjoy themselves, enjoy the\nparty. I don\u2019t care who I bring on with\nme, as long as I achieve that.\u2019 True\nenough, considering that he played a\ngig with Damon Albarn only a couple\nof days before and has recorded with\nartists ranging from Albarn himself, to\nsaxophonist/rapper Soweto Kinch, top\nLondon DJs Scratch Perverts and hiphop heavyweights Roots Manuva and\nDe La Soul.\nA week before the Jazz Caf\u00e9 gig\nsaw the annual Brit awards and Ty\u2019s\nopinion was rather frank: \u2018It\u2019s simple,\nthey\u2019re killing music. All this pop-mu-sic-industry back-slapping takes away\nthe focus from artists who take risks\nand are innovative. UK hip-hop artists\nare struggling to get the recognition\nthey deserve because the only way to\nget recognised is to conform to the industry\u2019s expectations.\u2019 It is worth noting that his inspirational sophomore\nTy\nLive at Jazz Caf\u00e9\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nalbum Upwards was nominated for the\nprestigious Mercury Music Prize in\n2004, eventually missing out to Franz\nFerdinand\u2019s influential debut.\nPlans for 2008? \u2018Recording.\u2019 Trying to\ntease out some juicy information about\nstyle, timeline and collaborations was\ndifficult: \u2018I\u2019ll be recording but I don\u2019t\nhave a particular agenda for it at the\nmoment: it\u2019s still in the early stages. I\nlike to just take my time, make music\nthat I really feel, take the best tracks\nand put it on a record.\u2019 Judging from\nhis three previous outings, the new instalment of the Ty musical saga will be\ninteresting listening indeed.\nDavid Kaye\nThe return of Coldplay\nThere is something very catchy about\nViolet Hill, be it the pounding drums\nthat carry you until the penultimate\nchorus or the well-placed guitar riff\nhalfway through. Either way, it\u2019s a solid\nsingle at the start of what promises to\nbe a great album. Coldplay fans rejoice,\nand music listeners enjoy.\nStuart Higgins\nattention too, funny entertainment to\nsay the least. Seemingly, it pays tribute\nto \u2018A Nightmare on Elm Street, Part III:\nThe Dream Warriors,\u2019 and \u2018The Good,\nthe Bad, and the Ugly,\u2019 with both Chris\nand Keith embracing the role of cattle\nherders in the Old West. These musi-cians, they really do just have a kind of\nfetish for weird and wonderful backdrops don\u2019t they? I guess a change of\nscene does no harm...\nHaving just finished the \u2018Back in\nStyle\u2019 tour across the country, the duo\nare set to headline a night at Ibiza\nRocks in July, which promises to be\na real firecracker. Scientists have yet\nagain enlightened us with their dynamite inventions.\nSusan Yu\nThe Pigeons looking tough\nRoyworld calmly sits in Dust\nColdplay, showing how pensive indie poses should be done...\nThese mad, mad Scientists have many, many tricks up their sleeves\nScientists\u2019 heady concoction\nTy vry mch 4 ur awesum gig\nTy\u2019s friends are such jokers\n\n"

However the show went on and\nthe hockey started with a bang\u2026 and\na siren\u2026and a horn! Some surprisingly decent hockey was played with\nmany nursing hangovers and the rest\nhaving not picked up a stick for a few\nmonths (or a few years in the case of\nthe old boys). With the tournament in\nfull swing and the roasted pig and lamb\narriving courtesy of The President the\nrain started\u2026 after a week of scorching\nsun the typical British sun had been\nsubstituted for grey clouds and a brisk\nbreeze. But the club members (new\nand old) have been hardened week in\nweek out playing at the barren-wind-swept landscape that is The Fortress\nHarlington. The play went on and an\ninteresting mix of spritely youngsters\nand clapped out old gits had reached\nthe semis. The youngster team, The\nRingers, were to play the all granny\nGaol Pie!, while the mid-aged All Stars\ntook on the great-grandfathers of the\ntournament Imperial Strangers\u2026 but\nfirst it was time for a spot of lunch!\nThe hog and the lamb were devoured\nby the hungry players while Nedic led\nthe way in hacking up the meat.\nThe Semi-Finals resumed and the\nyouthful teams pulled through to the\ngrand-final. By now most had drunk\none or two pints and the club\u2019s most\nrecent member Mr. M. Phone was at\nhand to amplify any abuse the merry\nsupporters had to give. Even though\nboth teams were still trying to digest\nthe copious amount of meat consumed\nat lunch, the pace of the game was high.\nThe Ringers went up by two goals but\na dramatic substitution by the All Stars\ncaptain meant the score was all back\nsquare at the final whistle. Extra time\nand sudden death penalty flicks could\nnot separate the teams, and in a dramatic announcement by The President\nthat, it was decided that the winner of\nthe tournament would be decided by a\nboat race, which was agreed upon by all\npresent. Back up at the bar, the FA Cup\nFinal finished and the selected members from each of the finalist teams\ngot ready for a swift coxless five race\u2026\nthe competition was certainly not as\nclose as the hockey with The Ringers\nseeming to sink even before they had\nstarted, and the All Stars cruised in for\na 2 length victory!\nThe evening saw even more fun back\nat the Union Bar where generations of\nICHC Legends discussed their times\nat the best club in College! The Club\nwould like to thank Mark Roberton\n(ICHC President) for hosting such a\ngreat day and we will all be back next\nyear for more beer, meat and hockey!\nHockey Club President, Mark Roberton\nThe hog and lamb roast ready to be devoured by the hungry mob\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n4 felix Friday 23 May 2008\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 Li-Teck Lau and Kadhim Shubber\nCannabis review: \u201cnot necessary\u201d\nChair of the Technical Committee of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and Professor of\npsycho-pharmacology David Nutt speaks to James Goldsack, sharing his views on the reclassification\nI\nn July 2007, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith called for a review of\nthe classification of cannabis, at\nthe time a Class C substance, in\npart because of public concern\nbut also due to the increased use of a\nstronger form of cannabis, skunk.\nThe review, undertaken by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs\n(ACMD), was published last month\nand recommended that cannabis remain Class C. In the face of this recom-mendation, Jacqui Smith has decided\nto push for a reclassification, moving\nthe drug up to B.\nShortly after this decision was made,\nI met with Professor David Nutt, a psy-cho-pharmacologist at Bristol University and Chair of the Technical Committee of the ACMD, to find out more\nabout the decision, drug culture and\nthe classification system.\nWhat is your position on the\nACMD?\nI am one of 3 psychiatrists on the Council and I think I have been a member of\nthe Council for about 8 years now. I am\na psycho-pharmacologist and my main\nresearch is into addiction and anxiety disorders. As I know about drugs\nand the brain I am the chair of what is\ncalled the Technical Committee that\ndoes the technical assessment of drugs\nand tries to understand their risks\nand harms. The Technical Committee comprises some technical experts\nfrom the Council, all with a scientific\nor technical background. The Committee did not do a separate analysis\nof cannabis this time. It did before for\nan important paper published in the\nLancet journal last year which was the\noutput of many years assessment by the Technical Committee on\nthe harms of drugs.\nWere you a\nmember\nwhen cannabis was declassified?\nAt that time were you for the\ndeclassification?\nYes that is right. I cannot speak for the\ncouncil but I can tell you this: the first\ndecision was unanimous, in 2004 there\nwas 1 dissenter and in 2008 there were\n3 dissenters. The Council is 31 people\nso you can see the proportion. Yes, I\nbelieve cannabis should be Class C, always have and have always agreed with\nthe council.\nWhy was there a review into the\nclassification of cannabis and was\nit necessary?\nWell, the beginning of the report refers\nto a letter from the Home Secretary\nsaying why she wants it reviewed. The\nkey issue, what people worry about, as\nfar as I understand is that cannabis is\nnow mostly skunk, and skunk is different from resin. However, is it possible that skunk is more dangerous\nthan resin? Is it going to cause more\nproblems in the long term? That is why\npeople are more anxious because the\nconcentration of tetrahydrocannabi-nol (THC) has gone up probably 2 to 3\nfold on average of what people are purchasing in the past 15 years. We don\u2019t\nknow if that changes how much people\ntake, whether they get more THC in\ntheir blood or not. The main concern\nis that stronger skunk might be leading\nto more problems. There is a slightly\nodd thing about cannabidiol (CBD). It\nmay be a red herring but CBD is another constituent of resin which is not\npresent in skunk. Some people think\nthat it is anti-psychotic so the theory is\nwhen you take forms of cannabis other\nthan skunk, the THC and CBD work\nagainst each other. It\u2019s just a theory,\nthere\u2019s no strong evidence. So some\npeople think that is why skunk is more\nlikely to make you psychotic. However,\nthis time I do not think the review was\nnecessary; the evidence of new\nharm isn\u2019t based upon very\nmuch.\nBased upon the evidence\nyou have seen, what is the\npublic\u2019s view?\nIt was somewhat disingenuous of\nthe home secretary to say that the\nmajority of the public surveyed by\nthe ACMD were in favour of class B\nas she did not say 80% wanted\n2 year or less penalties with\n27% wanting no penalty!\nThere\u2019s a mismatch and I think this is\na really important point \u2013 the public\ndon\u2019t want to penalise people for using\ncannabis but they do want to warn and\nscare people off it. I actually think, to\nbe honest, that the government don\u2019t\nactually know what they are going to\ndo about punishments. They seem to\nwant Class \u201cB\u201d as a scare tactic but it is\nridiculous that people could face being\nin prison for 5 years for possession of a\nsingle joint. What would be the point?\nPrison is hugely expensive and I don\u2019t\nthink the majority of the parents who\nare against cannabis actually want their\nkids locked up. Probably about a half\nof the younger population have used it.\nMany people use it regularly and they\nargue, why should it be illegal anyway?\nCannabis is\na health is-sue, not a legal\nissue.\nIs there any reason to\nscare people off cannabis\nmore than other Class C drugs?\nYou will have to ask the\nHome Secretary! I presume there is a feeling\nthat some people are harmed; some\ndrop out of university, some become\npsychotic, a few might become schizo-phrenic. There are harms associated\nwith cannabis use, that\u2019s true. The\nquestion is whether they\u2019re sufficient to\nmake it Class B. We didn\u2019t think so because although the harms are well rec-ognised, they\u2019re relatively rare. So you\nrisk criminalising a lot of people more\nseverely to protect a few who might\ncome to harm. As well as that, I don\u2019t\nthink there\u2019s any evidence to show that\nthe popularity of a drug depends upon\nthe class. Ecstasy is Class A yet lots\nof people use it. The question is, why\ndoesn\u2019t class change people\u2019s attitudes?\nOne of the arguments we have always\nbeen pursuing is that if the anomalies\nof classification are taken out, maybe\npeople would take notice. That is what\nwe are trying to push towards, a proper\nevidence-based classification.\nSo should the classification criteria or methodology be changed?\nOr is it just that some drugs are in\nthe wrong category?\nThat is what is in the Lancet paper.\nClearly, a lot of drugs are anomalously\nclassified; Ecstasy, LSD and mushrooms for example. These should certainly be less than A. Maybe C, B or C,\ndepends. But definitely there are some\ndrugs which are Class A but shouldn\u2019t\nbe. That I think undermines the whole\nclassification system. Class A should be\nHeroin, cocaine, methamphetamines,\nother strong opiates.\nThe Times reported that before\nthe report came out, Jacqui Smith\nwas prepared to override the\nCouncil\u2019s decision if necessary.\nWas it a surprise that Recommendation 3 was rejected?\nWe elect the government to do what\nthey think is best for the country but as\nwe all know quite often they get things\nwrong! There is a peculiar ground\nswell of political opinion which is very\nold fashioned in respect to drugs. They\nseem to feel that punishment and interdiction - the very hard line approach -is actually going to somehow solve the\nproblem which of course it never has\ndone and probably never will do. People will get caught in the cross fire of\nthat. It\u2019s actually quite a naive position.\nThe Home Secretary did accept 20 of\nthe 21 recommendations but what we\nneed to know is whether she is going\nto deliver on them or not.\nMany of the other recommendations appear to support cannabis\n\u201cCannabis is a\nhealth issue, not\na legal issue\u201d\n\u201c[The\nreclassification]\nappears to have\nbeen a political\ndecision\u201d\nChair of the Technical Committee of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, Professor David Nutt\n\n"

However it was their nervousness\nwhich was predominant. Manchester\nUnited were playful, relaxed and com-fortable, probably because they have\npreviously been to the final.\nThe teams were evenly matched,\nwith Chelsea having a slight advantage with their recent form. United\nhad stumbled in run up to the climax\nof the Premier League and Chelsea had\ndone their best to capitalise on this, to\nno avail.\nPleasantries from both managers\nwere exchanged and the stage was set.\nTacky Olympic-esque opening ceremony aside, the spectacle began.\nBoth teams started off nervously\nwith early long ball strategies deployed\nto test the quality of the reported crap\npitch. Lubo\u0161 Mich\u0115l stamped his authority with frequent stoppages in play\nfor feeble tackles. We were in Europe\nand not England of course.\nThe first half was dominated by\nUnited with Ferdinand and Vidic keeping out the dangerous Drogba and\nRonaldo causing Chelsea stalwart, Essien problems. Scholes and Makelele\nclashed heads in the twentieth minute\nleaving both players with a booking\nand Scholes a broken nose. Ronaldo\nsilenced his critics six minutes later by\nscoring in a big game. A slick one-two\nby Scholes lead Wes Brown to deliver\na cross in which Ronaldo escaped Essien to head past Petr Cech. After a\nmasterclass in goalkeeping from both\nsides producing fine reaction saves\nChelsea drew level. Lampard caught\non the end of a deflected Essien shot\nand sloted home past Van der Sar after\nhe slipped.\nThis gave Chelsea confidence and\nthey were by far the dominant team\nin the second half. Essien and Ballack\nfoiled half chances after a good spell of\npossession by the Blues. United were\nalmost silenced further with twelve\nminutes to go when Drogba superbly\nspun and unleashed a Kraken off the\npost.\nUnited hung on and forced the game\ninto it\u2019s third half. After excellent but\nunconverted chances from Lampard and Evra, the game went into the\nfourth half unchanged. This was largely uneventful except for Drogba getting sent off for slapping a brick wall. A\ndisappointing end to his rumoured last\ngame for Chelsea.\nA penalty shoot-out was to decide\nthe winner for the fourth time in seven\nyears. Champions League top scorer\nRonaldo almost suffered \u201cthe worst\nday of his life\u201d after he could not help\naiming his shot at the scientifically\nenhanced fluorescent orange jersey of\nCech. But that title went to John Terry\nafter he slipped, sending his penalty off\nthe bar.

    "content": "business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness\nBusiness Editor \u2013 Afonso Campos\nAn ageing population issue\nWhat happens to the economy when states cannot take care of those that need it\nAfonso Campos\nBusiness Editor\nThe ageing population is a highly complex issue posing monumental challenges\nnotonlytotheUnitedKingdom,butmost\nEuropean territories as well. Alongside\nthe increase in the number of the elderly,\nis a juxtaposed near-stagnation of teenagers and children. Projections scarily show\nthat in the very near future, this age-band\nwill actually suffer a decrease. Two things\nare absolutely essential; on one hand, it is\nvital to unify all possible efforts to invert\nthis trend, while on the other, facing this\nnew demographic reality and solving the\nconsequences that with it follow is no less\nof a need.\nThere are countless factors that drive\nan ageing population, that is, an ever-increasing number of old people facing\nan ever-decreasing number of youths.\nFirst and foremost, advances in science\nand medicine in the past few decades\nhave provided the world with an increase\nin life expectancy at birth. According to\nsome of the most recent data, this is currently at 78.5 years. Radical changes in\nthe population\u2019s lifestyle are also a major\ncontributor to this. The most evident,\nhowever, was the change in the status of\nthe woman, for whom being a housewife\nis no longer the only option or mother\nhood the only domain; women are fully\nintegrated in the workforce. This almost\n\u2018forces\u2019 the woman to conciliate her professional activity with maternity, leading\nher to have children much later.\nRegarding principal consequences of\nthis change, the most obvious of all is a\nvisible decrease in the active popula-tion. Another, a result of the latter, is a\npossible collapse of social security in its\ncurrent form-factor. From this it follows\nthat there must be a significant change in\nthis paradigm. This proves much harder\nto do than to say, given that in current\nmoulds, governmental spending on geriatric health care is mind-bogglingly high.\nA diminishing quality of life of the elderly\nalso means that, legitimately and rightly\nso, the active population must take care\nof this age band. After reaching a certain\nage, some people desperately require\nconstant and permanent care and homes\nfor the elderly are many times the only\noption and optimal solution. Ideally and\nutopianly, everyone should have access to\ntrulydignifiedhomeswiththeconditions\nnecessary for the provision of help on all\nlevels, including medical and social.\nThe great majority of these homes are\nof a private nature and are not accessible\nto all those that may need them. Thus, the\nonly \u2018solution\u2019 remaining is that of public\nretirement homes. In fact, the term \u2018solution\u2019 is nowhere near to the most adequate word for the scenario, given that\nthese homes are invariably bursting at\nthe seams and thus without any vacancies whatsoever. The official government\nresponse that we are used to seeing\nand hearing around us through\nindividuals and institutions,\nis that it is very possible to\nincreaseinstantaneousva-cancies. Even in this case,\nthe supposed solution is\nnot minimally useful or\nhelpful to those who\nneed a solution the\nmost as this method\nof vacancy creation\ncomes in the form\nof a \u2018voluntary donation required\u2019.\nIn actuality how-ever, this donation is anything\nbut optional or\n\u2018voluntary\u2019. It is\nsomewhat un-derstandable, but\nfar from accept-able. It is also\nunderstandable\nthat if possible,\nthe elderly or their\nfamilies will do what\nthey can, within their\nconstraints and possi-bilities, to put forward\nthe roughly \u00a310,000 to\n\u00a315,000 as they consider\nthis preferable to the otherwise long wait they would\nhave to endure.\nThe government currently participates\nAfonso Campos\nwith roughly \u00a3370 per OAP, when their\nspending can at many times be roughly\ntwice this almost pathetic amount. This\nis not an acceptable practice on the government\u2019s part given that it is neither just\nnor egalitarian. If a retirement home is of\na public nature, it must offer access conditions that are the same for all that may\nrequire them. The role of the\ngovernment must be on one\nhand, to assure the existence of necessary vacancies through a change in\nthe policies of contribution\nto homes on the behalf of\nthose that need it, and on the\nother, to incentivate the creation of new homes through\nstate-private partnerships.\nIn a country the claims to\nbe one of the most developed in the world, it is not\nacceptable that a low form of\nbribery may exist, especially\nin public institutions.\nThe government is\nable to play many\nroles in this are-na; firstly, it must\nassure the coverage of costs\nincurred by the\nhomes, and after this, create\nan incentive\nplan for new\nhomes. It must\nalsochangeits\nown participation plan,\nin which the\nreal costs\nof the retirement\nhome and the\neconomic and fiscal situation of its users are taken\ninto account.\n13\nFriday 23 May 2008 felix\nT\nhere hasn\u2019t been a column\nin a relatively long time.\nSorry about that, devoted\nreaders. Today, I shall give\nyou something a little dif-ferent. Instead of incessant rambles\nabout how crap you are at making your\nmoney work for you, or how much of a\nhippie you are, I shall try to give a small\ninsight into how I think about the markets every month. It\u2019s not a magical\nformula \u2013 it might not work for you;\nin fact it most probably won\u2019t, but it\nmight give you a whisk of inspiration\nif you will. It isn\u2019t analysis of the past,\nhowever, that makes money for some-one; it\u2019s the prediction of the future.\nThe idea here is that you make a sort\nof educated guess where you try to understand where in the market are there\nmore gaps in knowledge. The way I see\nit, if you are able to gather more information than anyone else on a very specific topic, you are single-handeledly\ncontributing to the \u2018perfect knowledge\u2019\nthat markets supposedly have. That in\nitself is epic. Knowing that you have\nalmost single-handedly outsmarted a\nbunch of other people is a monumental feeling. Rant over.\nFor weeks the subject of commodities has been newsworthy and has featured in both finance and non-finance\npublications alike. The increase in the\nprice of food has a great impact in the\nbudget of families whose resources are\nstretched the most to begin with. At\nthe same time, the stock market and\nthe US dollar have been recovering\nfrom losses from early on in the year,\nremoving some polish from the metals,\nespecially gold. In the field of fuels, oil\nhas remained at very high levels, leading to some investment professionals\nspeculating $200 barrels in the medium term. I am still pretty bullish in the\ncommodities market. However, new\ninvestments will be treated with caution given the crazy ride they\u2019ve been\nhaving, gaining almost 30% per month\nto date with ridiculous amounts of\nvolatility. It\u2019s good if you can stomach\nit and don\u2019t care about your Sharpe ra-tio, otherwise you might want to hide\nin a corner and look at it pass you by.\nDo you have enough balls for months\nof 12% gains even if it means a month\nof 6% loss? While quantitative inertia is\nlooking pretty dandy, the volatility, like\nI said, is killer.\nIf I were you, I\u2019d be looking (I am) at\ngold, silver and sugar. The easiest way\nfor you to go about buying these sexy\ncommodities is through any instruments that have these as their underlying vehicle. You\u2019d be foolish to look anywhere else but futures, really. The idea\nof buying and keeping massive bars of\ngold, like some still do in the East, is\nheavily outdated. Why not go all exotic\nand make what I believe to be a killer\ntrade? I would buy gold and hedge your\nrisk with a long USD position. Don\u2019t\ntrust everything I say. You want to be a\ngood trader? Quit your crappy degree,\ndo something quantitative, subscribe\nto The Economist, put your money on\nthe line and learn to not feel the pain\nwhen it all goes to shit.\nThe increase in life expectancy has led to several logistical problems for governments\nA high proportion of the elderly tend to end up alone and unhealthy\n\n"

An ability to clone itself, it seems...\nFree will and independent thought\nmay be considered superior traits in\nsome circles, but for the welfare of a\ncommunity, consensus-based decision\nmaking may be smarter.

While quorum responses have been observed for social\ninvertebrates like ants and bees, Dr\nWard and his collaborators believe\ntheir experiment is the first time that\nsuch behaviour has been documented\nfor animals with more complex nervous systems.\nThe study observed the behaviour of\nfish in the presence of danger (a model\nof a predator) and their reaction to\nleaders, in this case, replica fish.

No, this wasn't how Leif\nKullman found out his spruce tree's age: he used carbon-14 dating. Hmm, Leif... Was he destined to work on trees?\nA new contender for the world\u2019s oldest\nliving tree is a 9,550 year-old Norway\nspruce found in the Darlana province\nof Sweden last month. The spruce had\npreviously been assumed to be a fairly\nrecent arrival to the Swedish mountain\nregion.\n\u201cOur results have shown the complete opposite, that the spruce is one\nof the oldest known trees in the mountain range\u201d, says Leif Kullman, Professor of Physical Geography at Ume\u00e5\nUniversity.\nSpruce trees survive the harsh\nmountain weather conditions by reproducing via clones, a feature which\nalso explains the long life expectancy\nof the tree. The main trunk is usually\nonly 600 years old, but when it dies a\nnew trunk can grow up from an underground root system to replace it.\nThe tree can also clone itself in winter,\nwhen heavy snow pushes the low-lying\nbranches to the ground, allowing them\nto take root and become new trees, genetically identical to their parent.\nThe research team led by Kullman\nused carbon-14 dating on bark and\ncone remains under a spruce in Fulu\nMountain which revealed four \u201cgenerations\u201d of tree: 375, 5,660, 9,000 and\n9,500 years old. The remains were\nfound to be genetically identical to the\ntree above them, and so are clones of\nthat tree.\nKullman believes that these spruce\ntrees may provide a useful insight into\nclimate change. As well as having been\naround for a long time, the Norway\nspruce also seems to respond to temperature changes. It originally grew\nin a shrub formation in the Swedish\nmountain region, but has since evolved\na more upright trunk in response to\nrising average summer temperatures\nover the last 100 years.\nWhether the spruce is the world\u2019s\noldest tree is contentious. Previously,\nthe oldest recorded individual tree\n(not a clone) was a 4,768 year old bris-tlecone pine tree in the White Mountains of California, according to the\nScientists have announced a novel\nmethod of attacking the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the cause\nof AIDS.\nThe study, a collaboration between\nBoston University and the National\nHuman Genome Research Institute\n(NHGRI), investigated the targeting of\na protein located on human immune\ncells. Once targeted, the virus was unable to infect these cells. Eric Green, the\ndirector of the NHGRI, said that \u201cThis\nnew insight represents an important\ncontribution to HIV research,\u201d and\nspoke of the discovery as \u201can exciting\nmodel for deriving potential new HIV\ntherapies.\u201d\nThe human immune system is made\nup of white blood cells, a large proportion of which are known as T cells.\nIt is these cells that the HIV virus attacks when it infects the human body.\nThe researchers interfered with inter-leukin-2-inducible T cell kinase (also\nknown as ITK), a signalling protein on\nthe surface of these cells. The protein\nis responsible for the activation of Tcells, required for the body to mount\nan efficient immune response.\nSchwartzberg, one of the lead re-searchers, explained that \u201csuppression\nof the ITK protein caused many of the\npathways that HIV uses to be less ac-tive, thereby inhibiting or slowing HIV\nreplication.\u201d\nDrugs in the past have targeted proteins present on the virus itself. This is\nproblematic, as a process called genetic mutation means these proteins can\nrapidly alter in composition, allowing\ndrug-resistant strains to appear. The\nhuman cells, however, have a much\nlower mutation rate, thereby making\nthem an optimal target.\nThe inactivation of ITK was carried\nNovel findings in the fight against HIV\noverrule its own instinct, and follow, in\norder to stick with a 'friend.'

Set along the Thames, it is home to a huge range of flora in and out of doors. The formal garden setting\nprovides an aesthetically pleasing and botanically organised way of displaying such beautiful plant life. The houses,\nsuch as the Lily, Palm, and Temporate Houses, are architectural delights unto themselves and contribute to the\nfeatures of note at Kew. The gardens include Japanese, rose, knot and rock varieties and there are other features\nsuch as the introduction of limited and temporary areas of farm crops to illustrate farm ecosystems.\nAnyone who has lost the will or ability to perambulate can jump on the Kew Explorer, a small road train which\ncomes at an additional cost. Unfortunately there is an entry fee to pay. However, the Old Deer Park at Richmond\nborders the Gardens which makes for a more relaxed and economical alternative, where beachwear and Frisbees\nare more appropriate.\nHolland Park\nAlthough it may be the Royal Borough\u2019s largest, it is one of the smallest public parks in London\nas a whole. Taking its name from Sir Henry, Earl of Holland, the park is essentially the grounds\nof Holland House which was occupied by Cromwell\u2019s Parliamentarian army during the Civil War\n(1642-1651). What is left of the house after bombing during WWII is now a youth hostel and\nalso houses temporary exhibitions. For those not content merely basking in the May sunshine or\nstrolling around the formal and informal gardens and woodlands, there are tennis courts, cricket\nnets, a golf bunker, netball and football courts. The park is home to the Kyoto Japan Garden, an\neco garden, which was developed for the 1991 London Festival of Japan. What better way to woo\na loved one then by meandering through the rose gardens as the peacocks only add to the beauty\nof your surroundings. Alternatively you can gate crash the adventure playground!\nDuring the summer one can return to Holland Park in the evening for a wide range of operatic and\ndramatic events. If you go along please do send us a review!\nHampstead Heath\nThe infamous playground of the rich and famous, this is another north London offering with superb views over\nLondon which some of the more central and southern parks do not have. The heath is made up of hilly terrains\nas well as bogs, streams and ancient woodlands which were saved from development by residents during the\n19th Century. The heath boasts the largest variety of wildlife of any other London open space and this is due\nto its more rustic and \u201cuntouched\u201d feel as a result of the absence of tarmac roads, signs and formal plantings,\nalthough there are increasing signs of modernisation such as the possibility of installing CCTV. One hopes that\nnotion will be abandoned like the move to ban the swimming in the ponds. Thankfully, swimming is still allowed and so strip off and cool off if you don\u2019t mind a bit of mud and dirt! The heath spans Highgate in the east\nand Parliament hill in the south east. This location is perfect for those missing their more rural home settings\nor for those in need of escape from the South Kensington bubble.\nChapter Ten \u2013 Pretty Parks in London\n\n"

The\nfour-level building complex in the his-toric, medieval walled city is the permanent home to many of the artist\u2019s\nmost prominent works and also home\nto one of the Giger Bars. The Gothic\narchitecture of the 400-year old space\nis mirrored by the designs for the bar\nwith giant skeletal arches covering the\nvaulted ceiling, stony furniture and a\n\u201cchurch-like\u201d feature which contrast to\nthe interesting-looking, body jewellery\nadorned bar staff.\nOne film work that truly pays homage and does justice to Giger is David\nN. Jahn\u2019s H.R. Giger Revealed which\ncombines a documentary with a 3D\nOne view from inside the spectactular Giger bar in Gruyeres, Switzerland\nanimation of some of Giger\u2019s work\n(paintings, drawings and sculpture).\nAnd Jahn certainly is in a position to\ngive an insider\u2019s view on Giger, having\nworked as his assistant for a number of\nyears (a position many thousands of art\nstudents and fans alike would adore to\nbe in). The documentary seeks to illustrate just how magnificent Giger is as\nan artist instead of providing an insight\ninto his history or personality. Giger\u2019s\nreluctance to give interviews nowadays\nis due to the belief that he has said everything he has wanted to in undoubtedly countless previous interviews following his work on Alien, Species and\nalbum covers including Debbie Harry\nand ELP\u2019s, and does not wish to repeat\nhimself. Certainly, Giger seems to be a\nsomewhat shy and reclusive character,\nif not absent minded, still exuding per-sonality. As often with genius, he has\nthe quirks and desire to exist basking\nin and exploring the wonders of the\ndepths of his imagination. What Giger\npossesses is the \u201cHOW\u201d, the technical\nskill in realising the plot of the stories\nhis mind unfolds and the \u201cWHAT\u201d,\nthat is the imaginative power to create\nsuch intricately detailed images.\nHowever, this detailed surface textures\nof his paintings in no way detract from\nwhat it is he is presenting to us. The\nsheer fact that Giger can propel one\ninto the abyss of our own imagination is something many artists lack,\nalthough in the case of Giger\u2019s works\none can be equally spellbound by abandoning that imagination and taking a\nfree ride on what we see before us.\nOne psychiatrist remarked that never\nhad he seem anyone who manages to\nextract the experiences of the psyche\nand portray them so amazingly, and it\nis hard to disagree with him.\nBy watching Giger\u2019s Art in Motion, one\nbegins a forty minute journey of awe\nwith the 3D animation of his art married perfectly to sound effects and mu-sic. The aural dimension mirrors the\nobscurity, enhances and heightens the\nexperience edging the mind to go further into the realms of fantasy. Ten of\nGiger\u2019s work are brought to life as the\ncamera scans over them, allowing the\nviewer to appreciate in minute detail\nthings they might otherwise overlook\nwhen presented with it as a static image in a gallery or on paper. It begins\nwith Atomic Children, an ink drawing\ncompleted in 1967 when the threat of\nnuclear war inspired Giger to present\nhis idea of the potential horrors\nand mutations to human beings. So\ngroundbreaking and previously unseen\nwas his work that it was reacted to with\nshock. Yogurt tubs and dog excrement\nwere hurled at the showcases. What\nthose objectors were overlooking was\nan attention to detail nothing short of\ngenius: the stuff of dreams, nightmares\nand maybe even drug trips. The real inspiration for Giger\u2019s creations were the\nnightmares he had as a young boy and\nhis penchant for day dreaming. His will\nto overcome his fear manifested itself\nas the realisation, the \u201cmaking real\u201d of\nhis nightmares. His art will not appeal\nto all, with many paintings being quite\nsexually explicit in content. Here is a\nman with a profound understanding\nand interest in the human form. The\nart does not come off as seedy, pornographic or distasteful and is presented\nin a rather matter-of-fact way. The\nsexual content of the art pales in significance next to their visual impact. A\npersonal favourite is Erotomechanics,\nanother example of where Giger\u2019s concept and attention to detail baffles. The\nbeings in his art seem preconceived as\nif made my God Himself.\nFrom looking at one work, Biomechanical Landscape, it is clear where the inspiration for many subsequent films,\nsuch as The Matrix, came from. He has\ncreated the notion of the biomechani-cal. We live in a world of technological dependence and Giger illustrates\nthis in his work by conjuring a world\nwhere the living have become part of\nthe mechanical world around them.\nOther \u2018snapshots\u2019 from his works in the\nfilm include phallic trains in New York\nCity, grey landscapes not dissimilar to\nthe Mine of Moria in Tolkein\u2019s Lord of\nthe Rings, as well as a demonic, goat-like creature surrounded by svelte,\nsnake-skinned beauties in his work,\nThe Spell. One recurring paradox in\nso much of his work is, in a sense, the\n\u201cmasculine\u201d versus the \u201cfeminine\u201d. On\none hand many images in his creations have a dark, aggressive, demonic,\ncold and even satanic feel. Many of the\ncharacters could be intimidating but\nGiger depicts them in a still and serene manner where they always look\nat peace: horror so beautifully pre-sented. It is the industrial, mechanical\nand masculine versus the svelte, gold\nand goddess-like beings. It truly is like\nmagic and it is no wonder that Giger\nwill appeal to so diverse an audience:\nscience fiction fans, fetishists, S&M\nlovers, fans of heavy metal and even\nthe girly girls who dream of fairies and\nnymphs. Some may accuse Giger of Satanism, given the dark nature of some\nworks, or a pervert because of the naked forms and sexual connotations.\nAlthough an interest in the occult, that\nis, \u201cthe hidden\u201d, could understandably\nlead to people believing so, it has been\nconfirmed by many sources, including\nJahn, that Giger is no such Satanist. Or\npervert for that matter. Interestingly,\nhe was recently married to the director\nof the Giger Museum in Gruyeres.\nWith so much emphasis often put upon\nthe \u201culterior motive\u201d of a piece of art in\na lot of modern art, it is a joy to merely\nenjoy art for how it looks and for its\nbeauty. Even if, aesthetically, Giger\ndoes not inspire something magical in\nyour mind, his pure technical skill will\ndazzle you.\nIn the words of New York artist, Pet\nSylvia, \u201call we have to do is sit back and\nenjoy the work.\u201d\nThe Dark Island\n\n"

When asked: \u201cWill the government\u2019s reclassification of cannabis\nfrom a class C to a class B drug change\nyour smoking habits?\u201d 25 out of 26 IC\ncannabis smokers answered \u201cNo\u201d and\nthat they will continue as usual.\nFelix conducted the survey this week\nfollowing the Home Secretary, Jacqui\nSmith\u2019s recent decision to strengthen\nlaws on cannabis use, despite a government commissioned report recom-mending: \u201cCannabis should remain a\nClass C drug.\u201d The report, which was\npublished in April and written by the\nAdvisory Council on Misuse of Drugs\n(ACMD), should never have been commissioned in the first place according\nto committee member Professor David\nNutt. The influential ACMD member\ntold Felix in an exclusive interview: \u201cI\ndo not think that the review was necessary \u2026 But if asked to review, we have\nto review.\u201d\nJacqui Smith authorised production\nof the report last July, in a bid to reverse\nTony Blair\u2019s downgrading of cannabis\nto a Class C drug in 2004. The downgrading was intended to cut police\ntime spent enforcing cannabis laws.\nSince then, worries about the effects\ncannabis has on users\u2019 mental health\nhave caused the Home Secretary to\ncall for the drug\u2019s reclassification. In\nparticular, Ms Smith is concerned that\na much stronger variety of the drug,\nnamely skunk, is dominating the cannabis market.\nSeemingly, the government was set\non reclassifying the drug and in May of\nthis year, when the ACMD published\nits review stating: \u201cCannabis more\nclosely equates with other Class C substances,\u201d Ms Smith chose to ignore the\nadvice. Cannabis is now set to return\nto Class B status in early 2009.\nEarlier this week, Felix surveyed 143\nmembers of the student body to find\nout how the reclassification would affect current cannabis users; whether\nstudents think the reclassification is\na good idea; and whether cannabis\nshould be illegal.\nThe 26 smokers were almost unanimous in their comments, with 98%\nstating that they would continue using cannabis in 2009, raising serious\ndoubts about the effectiveness of the\ngovernment\u2019s latest policy. Recent\ncomments from the Association of\nChief Police Officers (ACPO) have\nalso undermined the government\u2019s\nintentions. The ACPO said it will continue to police personal cannabis use\nwith the same tactics employed since\nthe drug was downgraded. \u201cShould the\ndecision be taken to reclassify cannabis to Class B,\u201d an ACPO spokesperson\nstated in early May, \u201cACPO believes\n[police should] retain flexibility in dealing with instances of possession on the\nstreet, including the discretion to issue\nwarnings,\u201d rather than to arrest.\nThe student body was split on cannabis\u2019 status, with a slight majority\nfavouring the drug\u2019s legalisation. 57%\nof students surveyed felt that the re-classification is a bad idea, whilst 54%\nfelt that cannabis shouldn\u2019t be illegal at\nall. Many referenced the Netherland\u2019s\nmore relaxed stance on cannabis use,\nbelieving the UK should follow suit.\n\u201cAll drugs should be legal,\u201d commented\none liberal student, \u201cit\u2019s my body and\nI should be allowed to do what I want\nto it.\u201d\nYet, for every argument against\ncannabis\u2019 reclassification, there were\nalmost as many opposing views. \u201cIt\nwasn\u2019t enforced properly as a C drug,\u201d\nasserted one anti-cannabis student. \u201cIf\nit\u2019s going to be illegal, then do it properly.\u201d Whereas another put it simply:\n\u201cdrugs are bad, mm\u2019kay.\u201d\nAccording to the survey, approximately 1 in 5 (18%) Imperial students\nsmoke cannabis. This comes in lower\nthan the national average of 27% for 18\nto 24 year olds, found in 2004. If these\nstudents are caught with cannabis on\nCollege property, Imperial will resort\nto its \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 policy on drugs\nuse. Students face eviction if found\ntaking drugs into halls, and in more severe cases they can be forced to leave\nuniversity.\nNationally, they currently face up\nto two years in prison for possession,\nhowever, after 2009 the maximum jail\nsentence will increase to five years.\nThat\u2019s if the police force actually embraces the government\u2019s changes; in\nreality, they could simply face a tick-ing-off and be sent on their intoxicated\nway.\nFor the full interview with the\nAdvisory Council on Misuse\nof Drugs committee member,\nProfessor David Nutt, turn to\npage 4. For comment on the\nreclassification of cannabis, turn\nto page 8\nOur survey says...\nDo you smoke cannabis?\nNo:\n72%\nYes:\n18%\nWill your smoking habits\nchange with the reclassification\nof cannabis to a Class B drug?*\nDid you know cannabis is being\nreclassified to a Class B drug?\nDo you think it is a good idea to\nreclassify cannabis as Class B?\nDo you think it should be\nillegal to smoke cannabis?\n43%\n57%\n36%\n64%\n98%\n2%\n54% 46%\nFelix surveyed 143 people in\nthe Junior Common Room, the\nUnion and the Sir Alexander\nFleming Building dining area\nduring two lunchtimes.\n*26 cannabis smokers were\nasked this question\nOur students say...\n\u201cThere\u2019s better stuff to do with police time than arrest cannabis\nusers, like stopping people get stabbed!\u201d\n\u201cAny drug use is most definitely wrong.\u201d\n\u201cThe entire classification system is flawed: many surveys say it\u2019s\nless dangerous than alcohol.\u201d\n\u201cWith the reclassification to Class B, there\u2019s more incentive for\ndealers to use crazy ingredients in cannabis and thus it will be more\ndamaging to society.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely no harm in making it illegal, but if it is legalised,\nI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\u201cIt should be illegal along with alcohol because they\u2019re both a\ndetriment to society.\u201d\n\u201cPeople need to be told not to smoke cannabis; they don\u2019t need to\nbe put in jail though.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s become a Class B drug again not because of its health\nrisks, but because of its prolificacy.\u201d\n\u201cProhibition doesn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t work with alcohol. You\u2019re just\nputting cannabis in the control of gangs if you make it illegal.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s useful in a medical context, but I don\u2019t think it should be on the\nstreets where you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blanket change to deal with those smoking skunk.\u201d\n\u201cIn Holland, it impresses no one if you smoke a spliff.

You don\u2019t?\nOh you didn\u2019t have any friends, so that\u2019s why\nyou\u2019re heavily involved in the Union... cunt.\nH to the o, r, o, sizzle copes \u2013 it\u2019s the Horoscopes\nAquarius\nThis week, the guy\nwho writes the\nhoroscopes overhears you discussing\nhis work with those\nvapid imbeciles you\ncall friends. He decides to use your conversation for material. making you extremely\nparanoid. When was that? Where did I have\nthat conversation? OMFG I\u2019m being watched\naren\u2019t I? Yes... yes you are.\n28 felix Friday 23 May 2008\nNeedy McNeedy: tweaking nipples since \u201878\n2\n4yo F, GSOH, masochist,\nenjoys laughing at others\u2019\npathetic problems and then\npublishing said problems in\nstudent newspaper, seeks\ntroubled M for future columns. If interested email agony.felix@imperial.\nac.uk. I\u2019ll tell people we met at your\ntherapist\u2019s.\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nMy flatmate and I are doing a PhD in\nthe same research group. I see him all\nthe time, at home, in the office, in lab,\nin the Holland Club...\nAll aspects of my life are now linked\nto this guy who can\u2019t help talking about\nscience all the time. I knew being a\nPhD student was uncool, but I had\nnever imagined it would be totally de-pressing. Is my social life condemned\nfor the rest of my time in London?\nPostgradInDistress\nDear PostgradInDistress,\nNo. Your relationship has clearly\nreached saturation point, and your\nflatmate, being the kind of person (they\nare oh-so-common at Imperial) who\ncan only just distinguish between the\nfacial expressions of the insanely jubilant and the clinically depressed, needs\nto realise this.\nGiven how hard it is to explain the\nconcept of emotions to the uninitiated,\nI suggest you take matters further and\nsubtly get him to decide to hang out\nwith you less. A few ways you could\ndo this are: make a move on him (if\nhe isn\u2019t gay, find out first or this could\nbackfire), get a girlfriend with some really annoying characteristics, or take\nup strict religious practices which coincide with his daily routine. He\u2019ll soon\ndecide that he\u2019s better off without you,\nand you\u2019ll be free to continue your life\nunabated. (Doing a PhD is, in fact, not\ncool. You might want him back at some\npoint.)\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nMy best friends have finished all their\nwork and keep asking me to go out\nwith them and get drunk, but I\u2019ve got\nloads of stuff to do. They make me feel\nlike such a loser. How can I study and\nstill keep up my cool image?\nUpsetMedic\nDear UpsetMedic,\nWanting to spend time studying automatically makes you pretty uncool.\nWriting a letter about your \u201cproblem\u201d\nto fictionalised agony aunts in your college paper has pretty much pushed you\noff the scale of cool and into a slag pit\nwith croc shoes and people who watch\nBig Brother. You might as well just put\na bit more effort in and get a degree.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nI\u2019ve been on a couple of dates with this\ngirl from my hall, and things are going really well, she\u2019s really pretty and\nfunny and we\u2019ve had a really good\ntime. I\u2019m quite traditional, and even\nthough some of my mates have taken\nthe piss out of me for not sleeping with\nher yet, I\u2019m standing by my decision to\nwait for a bit and get to know her first.\nThe trouble is, the longer I leave it until we have sex, I get increasingly nerv-ous, and I don\u2019t get turned on thinking\nabout it. How can I make sure I don\u2019t\nlose my nerve (and my hard on) on the\nbig night?\nFrightenedFresher\nDear FrightenedFresher,\nThis is why it is always best to get the\nwhole sex thing out in the open as early\nas possible in a budding relationship\nbefore issues like this build up. Always\nput out on the first date, girls!\nYou\u2019ll need to drink heavily on the\ndate in question to make sure you\u2019re\nless worried/numb the pain when\nthings inevitably go wrong. Also, try\nand find your most arousing sexual\nfetish so that if you start getting floppy\nyou can close your eyes and think of ex-ams/men/the Rector and wait for the\nresults\u2026 Good luck!\nNeedy xxx\nShe\u2019s squeezing humanity\u2019s pimples for your benefit.

    "content": "8 felix Friday 23 May 2008\nComment, Opinion\n& Letters\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of Felix\nKadhim Shubber\nOn the reclassification of cannabis\nSome of Felix\u2019s finest give their views on the government\u2019s decision to regrade cannabis as a Class B drug\nT\nhe Advisory Council\non the Misuse of Drugs\n(ACMD) exists to advise\nthe government on illegal drugs. Specifically, its\nmandate requires it to consider whether the use of certain drugs constitutes\na social problem. So I ask you, readers,\nwhy does this body exist if government ministers, including the Prime\nMinister, are going to ignore its well-informed opinion?\nIn a report recently published by the\nACMD, which specifically considered\ncannabis, the conclusion was made\nthat cannabis should not be classified\nas a Class B drug. Look to pages 4 and\n5 of Felix, Professor David Nutt, Chair\nof the Technical Committee of ACMD\nstatesunequivocally,\u201cbasedonmedical\nevidence, cannabis should definitely be\nClass C\u201d: he further says that believing\ninterdiction will solve the problem is\nactually quite a na\u00efve position. These\nstatements largely sum up the view of\nthe ACMD in its report.\nWho is on the ACMD? 6 Professors,\nfocused in the general field of pharma-cology, 8 Doctors, a Reverend, a Judge,\nthe Assistant Comissioner of the Metropolitan Police and several other high-ranking police officers. I apologise for\nboring you with that long list, but the\npoint is that this body is made up of\npeople who have first-hand knowledge\nabout drug safety, enforcement and\nthe effects of drugs in society; in short,\nthey know a lot more about this issue\nthan Jacqui Smith or Gordon Brown.\nWhat, therefore, could motivate the\ngovernment to ignore the reasonable\nand intelligent recommendation of the\nACMD, considering that they\u2019re the\nones who asked for the report to be\nmade? Of course I am not suggesting\nthat government should be controlled\nby unaccountable experts (although I\nshould hope you are not na\u00efve enough\nto think that government policy originates from ministers), though that is\nnot the issue in this case. The government has chosen to ignore the advice\nof experts because there is another factor that the council did not take into\nconsideration, both because it would\nbe illegal for them to do so, and also\nbecause it is right for them to ignore it.\nThis factor is the public image of gov-ernment. Jaqcui Smith told the House\nof Commons that she had to take public perceptions into consideration.\nIt\u2019s not a case of the government\nmaking a difficult decision, rather, Jacqui Smith has decided to listen to the\nportion of society that has reactionary,\nuninformed views of drugs and who\ndo not come into regular contact with\ndrugs, instead of scientists, policemen\nand legal experts whose views are fully\ninformed and well thought out. The all-important question of why she did this\ncomes with a simple answer of num-bers, and by numbers I mean votes and\nby votes I mean the next general elec-tion. Labour is already being thrashed\nin the polls, the last thing they want to\ndo is allow the Conservatives to appear\ntough on drugs uncontested. In short\nJacqui Smith is sending a message to\nvoters that Labour is tough on crime,\nthough the only thing most people\nhear is \u201cI\u2019m doing what\u2019s best for my\npolitical career, not what\u2019s best for the\npeople of this country\u201d.\nIf you read the report, which I\u2019m certain nobody in this university will, you\nwill find that the Council are keen to\ndo away with the technicalities of the\ndrug classification system and consistently advise that cannabis should\nbe dealt with as a health issue rather\nthan a criminal issue. The evidence\nshows that the changes since the de-classification have been positive, with\na reduction in use while fears about\n\u2018skunk\u2019 are ummm\u2026 just fears. Instead\nof making a decision that will benefit\nthe health of the nation and reduce the\ndamage that cannabis does to society,\nthis Labour government has done the\nopposite and ensured that we all take\na collective step backwards away from\nan effective policy on drugs in this\ncountry.\nRule of the ignorant\nAndrew Turley\nThe politician\u2019s right to choose\nT\nwo weeks ago, the long-awaited report on cannabis from the Advisory\nCouncil on the Misuse\nof Drugs (ACMD) finally\nappeared. After nine months of careful deliberation, the expert panel, from\na wide range of professional back-grounds, and boasting an impressive\narray of degrees and distinctions, concluded that cannabis should not be reclassified as a Class B drug \u2013 relatively\ngood news for anyone \u2018puffing the\nmagic dragon\u2019 on a regular basis.\nHow did the government respond?\nThe same day, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that \u2013 wait for\nit \u2013 cannabis would be reclassified as\na Class B drug \u2013 bogus news for those\nusers (who presumably felt they were\nexperiencing some sort of \u2018bad trip\u2019)\nand on the face of it rather distressing\ntoo for anyone concerned about the\nrole of independent advice in government decision-making. But predicta-bly, there\u2019s more to the story than that.\nThe media was quick to clarify the\npublic\u2019s concern, lamenting the flagrant disregard for expert analysis. The\nmore vociferous outlets (you know who\nthey are) criticised the government for\ncommissioning an independent report\nto gain legitimacy for a controversial\narea of policy, and then choosing to\ndisregard it when the whole scheme\nspectacularly backfired and the report\ncontained the categorically \u2018wrong\u2019\nanswer.\nWhich is a pretty fair\nassessment of what hap-pened, but it isn\u2019t necessarily a problem. It\u2019s no\nbad thing that the government isn\u2019t blindly obeying the edicts of experts, but is instead\nmaking its own decisions. That is, after\nall, the politician\u2019s defining preroga-tive: to consider the advice and weigh\nit against the myriad other factors before moving one way or the other. Ours\nwould be a sorry state of democracy if\nour chosen leaders simply passed all\nthe tricky decisions onto groups of\nunelected and unaccountable experts.\nSuch groups undoubtedly provide\nvaluable analysis, but they shouldn\u2019t be\nallowed to run the country.\nBut whether the recommendations\nwere indeed carefully considered is de-batable. Was the government genuinely informed by the process? If it wants\nto overrule the experts, it\u2019s obliged to\nprovide adequate justification, evidence that it thought about what was\nsaid.\nThe Home Secretary has stressed\nshe was happy to acquiesce to the vast\nmajority of the report\u2019s suggestions,\naccepting 20 of its 21 recommenda-tions. But there is little there binding\nthe government to specific, meaningful action. The usual calls for more\nresearch, inquiries and monitoring,\nas well as campaigns aimed at raising awareness, all feature highly. But\nthe one recommendation with clear\nand direct implications, the recommendation to leave the classification\nunchanged, was the one rejected. The\nrest were mere window-dressing.\nThe report also allowed the government a curious degree of flexibility on\nthe specific issue of classification, hinting at a worrying level of negotiation.\nThe Council was required \u201cto consider\nonly [the harmfulness of cannabis] to\nindividuals and society\u201d and not \u201cto\ntake into account matters such as the\nmessage that is conveyed to the public,\nor the consequences for policing priorities\u201d. It is surprising, therefore, that\ndespite mentioning both these factors\nthe Home Secretary\u2019s main justification was the rise in the availability of\nskunk and the suspected link between\ncannabis use and mental illness. Both\nthese considerations fell within the remit of the report.\nBut this talk about skunk and the\ndangers of its purported potency begs\nanother question: if skunk is a distinct form of cannabis, which does\nindeed pose a significantly higher danger to society, why is it not classified\nseparately?\nThe answer is because the classification simply doesn\u2019t relate to actual\nusage. It\u2019s a smoke-screen obscuring\nmore pressing problems, specifically\nthe critical state Britain\u2019s drug laws are\nin.\nThe system of classification which\nforms the basis of the Misuse of Drugs\nAct has for some time been considered\nwoefully inadequate. The March 2007\nreport of the RSA Commission\non Illegal\nDrugs, Communities and Public Policy\nstated that Britain\u2019s current drug laws\nare \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d and that decisions are \u201cdriven by moral panic\u201d\nrather than evaluations of the potential\nfor harm.\nThe reclassification puts cannabis\nwith drugs such as amphetamines and\nbarbiturates, and from 2009 users will\nrisk up to five years imprisonment. But\nthis will matter little if policing and\nsentencing practices don\u2019t change, and\nearly indications suggest they won\u2019t.\nFirst time offenders will escape with a\nwarning. Those caught a second time\nwill receive an on-the-spot, \u00a380 fine.\nOnly those caught a third time will be\narrested and face the possibility of a jail\nsentence. This is not a grand departure\nfrom how the laws governing cannabis\nare currently interpreted. At present,\nas a Class C drug possession of cannabis is not an arrest offence and most\nincidences result in nothing more than\na warning and the confiscation of the\ndrug, although police can take stronger\naction against repeat offenders if public\norder is at risk or children are deemed\nvulnerable.\nThe reclassification of cannabis,\ntherefore, has allowed the government\nto appear tough on drugs without having to genuinely engage with the difficult and divisive issue of recreational\ncannabis use. Whilst the government\nfiddles with drug labels according to\nsuperficial party fashions, the crippling\nflaws in the legislation remain. We\nshouldn\u2019t worry that the\ngovernment rejected the\nACMD\u2019s recommendations,\nbut that the recommendations were destined to miss\nthe point from the outset.\n\u201c\nThe system\nof classification\nhas for some\ntime been\nconsidered\nwoefully\ninadequate\n\u201d\n\n"
