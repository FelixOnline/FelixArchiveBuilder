    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\n22\nTom Ravalde\nWhat would Jesus do?\nFor nonbelievers to properly engage wth Christians, they must\nlearn about the life of Jesus, says Tom Ravalde\net the dialogue begin.\u2019\nSo began Rory Fenton\u2019s\nthoughtful piece last week\n(\u2018Faitheism: the importance of dialogue\u2019) \u2013 encouraging the religious and irreligious\nalike to \u2018look for the common ground\u2019\nand \u2018work together\u2019 against extremism\nfor a better society. As a Christian, I\nwelcome this engagement from the\n(so called) \u2018faitheists\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s certainly\na refreshing change from the hostile\nrhetoric spouted by Dawkins et al.\nThe purpose of this response is to\nsuggest that we need to broaden the\nhorizons of much of our atheist-be-liever-interfaith dialogue, in order to\nhave a meaningful discussion. What\ndo I mean by that? My worry is that\nthe \u2018dialogue\u2019 is always on the terms\nof the faitheist. The faitheist (under-standably) de\ufb01nes the world\u2019s problems as they see them, and then wants\nto work with religion to oppose them.\nBut what if we view the world\u2019s situation in very di\ufb00erent ways? Solutions\nrequire a correct understanding of the\nproblem (ever misread an exam question\u2026?!) The Christian world-view\nhas a far deeper explanation of the evil\nwe experience than faitheism allows.\nThe hatred and bigotry described in\nlast week\u2019s article is undoubtedly rep-rehensible, but it is a manifestation of\na more fundamental predicament \u2013 a\nworld that\u2019s turned its back on its loving Creator \u2013 this is (broadly) what\nChristians mean by \u2018sin\u2019.\nAllow me to illustrate what I\u2019m saying with an incident from the life of\nJesus Christ \u2013 surely any meaningful conversation between atheist and\nChristian must try to understand him?\nIn Luke\u2019s Gospel, a paralysed man is\nbrought to Jesus \u2013 a man who in First\nCentury Israel would have had very\nlimited prospects. At this point, the\nfaitheist would call on people of all\nreligions and none to work together\nto improve this man\u2019s well-being and\nlife-chances. Shockingly, Jesus sees a\nneed greater than just the physical \u2013\nsaying, \u2018My friend, your sins are forgiven\u2019! Jesus tells us our biggest problem is to stand unforgiven before God.\nHis same words also tell us something\nstaggering about himself. The religious leaders are outraged \u2013 they consider Jesus a blasphemer: \u2018Who can\nforgive sins but God alone?\u2019 But Jesus\nis ready to prove his identity by healing the man: \u2018I tell you, get up, take\nyour mat and go home.\u2019\nThus, any honest dialogue with\nChristianity must conclude that Jesus\no\ufb00ers a solution in an altogether different category than that o\ufb00ered by\nhuman endeavour, meeting a more\nfundamental need than that which\nconcerns most of us. Whilst conversation remains restricted to faitheist\npresuppositions, one could be forgiven for thinking that all this talk of\n\u2018dialogue\u2019 and \u2018listening\u2019 is merely a\npretence. Could it be that faitheism\nelevates itself above religion, and uses\nit for its own ends?\nSo what form should \u2018dialogue\u2019 take?\nLet\u2019s be bold enough to take discussion to the \u2018uncommon ground\u2019, ask-L\n\u2018\ning questions about where the heart\nof humanity\u2019s problem really lies.\nLet\u2019s dare to allow the possibility that\nthe solution lies outside of our own\nabilities, and is found in a supernatural Saviour. Only then can all wrongs\ntruly be righted. If you think that dialogue surrounding these huge questions important, then why not engage\nwith the Christian Union? Friendly\ndialogue is at the forefront of their\nagenda. Starting next Monday, they\nare hosting \u2018What if \u2026\u2019 \u2013 a week for\nanyone to explore the life and claims\nof Jesus, and ask any questions (www.\niccu.co.uk/qr). We\u2019d love to see you\nthere.\nLet the dialogue continue.\nJesus is\nyour buddy\n\u201c\u201d\nLet\u2019s be bold\nenough to\ntake discussion to the\n\u2018uncommon\nground\u2019\nRead this and more on this \u2018internet\u2019 thing\nfelixonline.co.uk\nFollow us @FelixImperial \u2013 We have inane things to tell you\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail: felix@imperial.ac.uk \u2013 please.

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\n10\nt is hard to believe that I am\nover half way into my term\nas Deputy President (Wel-fare), elections still only feel\nlike they were last month!\nFollowing on from Paul\u2019s article last\nweek I am doing a manifesto review,\nbut also talking about all of the other\nprojects I have been involved in that\nI hadn\u2019t even dreamt up at the point\nof writing my manifesto. It has been a\nwhirlwind so far and I have genuinely\nreally enjoyed the job. Whilst doing\nmy degree I was constantly counting\ndown to the weekend with the general\nfeeling of WHAT IT\u2019S ONLY TUESDAY?!? This year Friday always seems\nto appear out of nowhere with all of\nthe meetings I have to go to and the\nprojects I\u2019m working on. It is hard to\nknow if the role has involved what I\nthought it would when I started out,\nI really enjoy the mix of representing\nstudents on welfare related committees and also having time to peruse\nwelfare campaigns and projects working with Union sta\ufb00. I would have to\nsay that the role is more varied than I\never imagined, which is a huge positive from my point of view. The biggest learning experience for me has\nde\ufb01nitely been having patience and\nrealising that I can\u2019t make things happen alone. When starting a new project you often need help and support\nfrom other sta\ufb00, other sabbaticals and\nCollege departments; and your priorities hardly ever match. That said, I will\ndo a manifesto review and then a brief\noverview of some of the other things I\nhave been involved with over the past\nyear.\nOn the right are\nthe main points\nfrom my mani-festo, but here\nis a quick overview of all the\nother projects\nthat I am\ncurrently involved with.\n\u2022 Mental\nHealth Campaign Planning \u2013 working on developing a campaign group of students to\ncarry out mental health campaigns. I\nam also working with other London\nbased Welfare Sabbs to hopefully carry out a London wide campaign.\n\u2022 Developing a Green Network as a\nlaunch pad for green campaigns and\ninitiatives \u2013 much more to come on\nthis soon. Watch this space.\n\u2022 New student led campaigns, no\nneed to write much about this here,\nturn to the Union page in Felix (page\n17) to \ufb01nd out more about this!\n\u2022 Exam stress \u2013 this will be a big\ncampaign in the summer term where\nthe Union will be trying to \ufb01nd quick\ninnovative ways for students to take\nlittle breaks and distress during revision period.\n\u2022 Unseen Imperial \u2013 campaigns\nabout underrepresented student\ngroups at Imperial. This also focuses\non destigmatising mental health.\n\u2022 Student Experience Survey \u2013 along\nwith a team of sta\ufb00 I am currently\nanalysing the data, and reading every\nsingle one of your free text comments.\nKeep a look out for the report, which\nwill be appearing over the next few\nmonths.\n\u2022 Pop up STI clinics in the Union.\nThis will hopefully happen over the\nnext few months.\nThat\u2019s just to mention a few. If anyone wants to get involved in any of the\nabove projects \u2013 then feel free to drop\nme an email! I really want to give some\npersonal advice if you are thinking of\nrunning for a sabbatical position (es-pecially DPW), don\u2019t let anyone tell\nyou that you aren\u2019t quali\ufb01ed/need\nto have experience. The less previous involvement you have had,\nthe steeper the learning curve;\nbut that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad\nthing. The Union needs new\nfaces to bring fresh perspectives and outlooks to problems\nand projects. If I had listened to\neveryone that told me I wouldn\u2019t\nwin my election campaign, then\nthere is no way I would be sat in\nmy o\ufb03ce writing this article right\nnow. GO FOR IT! If you have\nany questions about\nbeing Deputy President (Welfare) or\njust spending a\nyear as a sabbatical drop me an\nemail and I am\nalways happy\nto meet up\nfor a chat.\nThe Manifesto Review\nBecky Lane, Deputy President (Welfare) dusts the cobwebs off the\ncampaign material and sees what she thinks she has and hasn\u2019t done\nThis is a point that I am finally getting to work on! The way I envisage this working is to have something akin to a personal\ntutor logging system. This is an ICT based project that the ICT department can\u2019t begin until the previous project is finished.\nThe current ICT project is developing a new survey platform, which is hopefully coming to an end soon. I will be putting my\nproposals for this system to a board in a few weeks time. I am pushing for your personal tutor to be aware of your exam and\ncoursework marks also within this system. This hopefully means your personal tutors will be more aware of your general\nprogress and both senior tutors and personal tutors will be able to step in to help much earlier when problems arise. I also\nwant to tie this in with improved personal tutor training to ensure your personal tutor can effectively and sensitively support you and signpost you to college services.\nThe mums and dads system has been a joint project between myself and Doug Hunt. There are challenges; however the\nuptake has been better this year than previous year. I still believe that a centralised Union allocation system is the way\nforwards. This year, we held a mums and dads event called The Great SOCOFF in November, and we are planning for this\nto happen in the first fortnight next year. We are holding another night in March which will be bigger and better than the\nlast one \u2013 more to follow on this soon. We are going to deliver better training to departmental societies so that they can\nprovide better mums and dads events. We also hope to lobby departments to give more support to the mums and dads system meaning that going forwards it can be more effective. It was never going to be perfect in one year, but we are moving\nin the right direction.\nThis is of course a case of working jointly with/lobbying College. In the past year the counselling service has expanded, with\nthe hope that another counsellor will be appointed soon bringing us in line with the national average. How this support\nis communicated to students still needs to be improved and is something I am definitely working on. I am also lobbying to\nprovide increased support hours outside of the College day for all of the College welfare provisions. When you are stressed\nand down about work, the last thing you need is to miss lectures or labs. Hopefully by next year, the Counselling Service,\nthe Disabilities Advisory Service and the Health Centre will all be increasing their out of hours provision without cutting\nany existing hours.\n\u201cThere needs to be an effective feedback\nmechanism regarding personal tutors\u201d\n\u201cI think there also needs to be a more uniform\npeer support service from department to\ndepartment. Some faculties have buddy\nsystems; I think there needs to be a robust\nmodel rolled out throughout College.\u201d\n\u201cI will campaign to further increase the\nresources of the Student Counselling Service\u201d\nOver summer the amount of bike storage available in Beit Quad was doubled. Further long term solutions to bike storage\nneed to be investigated by the College.\n\u201cIncreased bike storage around College\u201d\nI\n\n"

    "content": "LOLCAT OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nLost in Translation\nhe Translation Unit of Imperialisunderthreat.There\nis currently a \u201cconsultation\nperiod\u201d going on. This will\ndecide the fate of the Unit.\nThe idea being that it doesn\u2019t fit with\nCollege\u2019s strategy. Maybe it doesn\u2019t, but\nhow is anyone supposed to know given\nthat when you ask them they refuse to\nsay what that even means.\nMany of you will not know about this\nUnit. Maybe some of you don\u2019t care. But\nwait, who will be next? Given that a Unit\nthat makes money can be axed, what\nabout anyone else, especially those\nthat are losing money? I fear that they\nwill go the way of the Life Sciences:\nthey will be cut like a DJ\u2019s sampler from\nthe 90s (that\u2019s one for all you \u2018old school\nravers\u2019 out there \u2013 sorry, I\u2019ve been playing a lot of Oxide and Neutrino in the office recently).\nYou may think this is rather presumptuous to say it is closing. Well, there\ncertainly is international support for it\nto remain open. Just look at the petition\nto keep it open and you\u2019ll see how many\nsignatures, and where they are from, it\nhas accrued in such a short space of\ntime. When was the last time you managed to get 10 people to do something,\nlet alone nearly 5000. That\u2019s impres-sive. I worry that this \u201cconsultation period\u201d is going to not really be that. I think\nit will be one of those consultations\nwhere it turns out the original suggestion is what happens in the end after\nconsulting with people just because\nyou need to show everyone that you\nare asking about. One of those studies\nwhere you stick your finger in your ears\nand scream \u201cLALA I\u2019m not listening, sor-ry, was working on my excellent (appar-ent) leadership skills\u201d when people reply\nto you. Just in case College are wonder-ing: look, you\u2019ve consulted, people have\nsaid your idea sucks, sorry to have to\nbreak the news to you.\nMaybe you will think that you don\u2019t\ncare about all of this as you don\u2019t think it\nis important. If not, that is fine. You can\nhave a reasoned debate about why you\nthink that, but you can\u2019t deny that many\npeople all over the world think the op-posite. As well as this, consider the fact\nthat it isn\u2019t losing money. This is what\nmakes the decision strange.\nPerhaps you still don\u2019t care. In this\ncase, put yourself in the lecturer\u2019s\nshoes. Image you have been told all of\na sudden that you are possibly going to\nbe made redundant when you thought\nit was all going well. It\u2019s a bit like walking into lectures one day and being told\nthat there is a consultation period on\nwhether or not to kick you out. You may\nbe a bit concerned and think that perhaps they have already chosen to get\nrid of you.\nI asked College if the staff are going to\nstay on until all current students are fin-ished, as they will need them to supervise the projects. The answer I received\nwas a non commital \u201cwe\u2019re in consultation before any final decisions are taken\nso aren\u2019t at that stage.\u201d That sounds like\na \u2018possibly not, but, for now, we have to\njust say something incredibly non specific\u2019. Surely that would be somewhere\non the agenda when discussing this. I\nmean, the people who made this decision are all accomplished individuals\nwho have words like \u2018professionalism\u2019\nand \u2018expertise\u2019 flying around their bios.\nWouldn\u2019t one pipe up and say \u201cerm, you\nknow how we say no students will be\naffected, well, what about the staff supervising them through their PhDs? Will\nthey stay on to keep supervising them?\nLet\u2019s discuss this and make an informed\ndecision on that outcome to not cause\ndistress and uncertainty\u201d.\nLuckily, there is hope that it will be\nable to at very least move to a different\nuniversity. However, the heavy emphasis on science is what leads me to believe that this is a good place for it, but\nI could be wrong. It will be interesting\nto see how this develops. I think that\ntranslation is important and hope that\nCollege reverses this decision and at\nleast finds a new home for the Unit.\nSEX SURVEY DRUGS SURVEY\nCLUBS AND\nSOCIETIES\nTalk about sex Chat about drugs I Night...\nYep, as you probably saw on the front page, the Felix Sex Survey is back.

Like\nBrian Cox\u2019s smiling, wistful\nface, science itself is increasingly entering the public consciousness. Every\nhaunt of internet culture \u2013 Reddit,\n4chan, your Facebook friends, etc.\n\u2013 discusses and valiantly defends science against the evils of false belief.\nThere\u2019s a newer, more insidious evil\narising, though: the many people who\nclaim to \u201cfucking love\u201d science without the slightest clue of how science\nworks. These are not mere na\u00efve spectators interested in science \u2013 I have\nno qualms with them \u2013 but those who\nuse their warped understanding of\nscience to win arguments and further\ntheir own misguided agendas.\nNow that scientists are cool, everyone wants to be one. Much like a\npriest wears robes to signal his being\npart of the clergy, scienti\ufb01c beliefs\nsuch as evolution, the bene\ufb01ts of nuclear power and even logical fallacies\nare held without understanding as a\nmeans of signalling being part of the\n\u201cscience\u201d group. They\u2019re wearing lab-coats, but without a science to do in\nthem.\n\u201cCorrelation does not imply causation,\u201d is a very useful phrase to scien-tists, but one that\u2019s become co-opted\nwithout the critical \u201cdoes not imply\u201d\nclause in online arguments. All too of-ten, any debate and discussion arising\nfrom the suggestion of a possible causal link is shot down with \u201ccorrelation\nis not causation!\u201d said with the smug\nself-righteousness of someone who\u2019s\nmemorised a few fallacies. I\u2019ve even\nI\nA shoutout to all so-called \u2018science lovers\u2019: go hard or go home.\nseen this said in response to peer-re-viewed, fairly-tested and statistically\nanalysed studies. These people don\u2019t\nlove science, in fact they\u2019re damag-ingly anti-scienti\ufb01c. They just love to\nsound smart.\nThis is further shown in the worrying meme of dismissing scienti\ufb01c\n\ufb01ndings as being \u201cobvious\u201d \u2013 the\nidea that something which is \u201ccommon sense\u201d doesn\u2019t need to be tested.\nCritically, common sense often turns\nout to be wrong, and any real scientist will know that there\u2019s great value\nin accurately quantifying things which\nseem obvious. A recent article on Fox\nNews and Hu\ufb00Po, \u201c12 Obvious Science Findings of 2012,\u201d lists the com-mon-sense \u201cfact\u201d that \u201csmoking a lot\nof pot can make your mind fuzzy.\u201d The\npaper, in fact, was a detailed cohort\nstudy, showing that marijuana use\nonly causes irreversible brain damage\nif used regularly by under 18s, measuring change in IQ and other tests of\nbrain function in several users. It\u2019s unlikely the journalist ever read the full\npaper \u2013 they just wanted to show how\nmuch smarter they are than those silly,\nwhimsical scientists by pointing out\nhow obvious their results are.\nWith creationism as one of the most\neasily-falsi\ufb01ed religious beliefs, evolution has become the biggest poster\nboy for science. Darwin\u2019s travels, collection of evidence and formulation of\na theory which has since been veri\ufb01ed\nand improved upon by fossil data is\nan almost perfect example of the scienti\ufb01c method in action. Evolution by\nnatural selection is GCSE-level sci-ence, but most people aren\u2019t willing\nto learn even the basics \u2013 they just\nprofess belief in evolution to signal\ntheir atheism. This leads to people\nlaughably talking about how creatures\n\u201cchoose to evolve,\u201d but more dangerously to racist beliefs supported by\ncrackpot theories about how humans\nhave \u201cevolved\u201d recently.\nI love science so much that I\u2019m\ndedicating my life to it and getting\npeople interested in it, but subjective opinions seemingly backed up by\nlogic and fact and the memorisation\nof a few intelligent-sounding phrases\nare not science. The work that people\nlike Neil deGrasse Tyson and Brian\nCox do is great \u2013 increasing public\nrespect for and interest in science is\nas important as actually explaining\nthe concepts. I\u2019m not asking that all\nnon-scientists understand science,\njust that they stop pretending to, and\nstop wearing the attire of scientists in\norder to win arguments on the inter-net.\nfa\nte\nh\n4\n\u201c\n\u201d\nThese people don\u2019t love\nscience, in\nfact they\u2019re\ndamagingly\nanti-scientif-ic. They just\nlove to sound\nsmart.\nOnline\nIn response to \u201cNUS: A Pottered History\u201d, 11th January:\nGood God man, nobody at Imperial cares! Don\u2019t force a referendum on us just because you couldn\u2019t think of anything better to\ndo with your time.\n- Anonymous\nThis is pre-campaigning.\nIn saying you\u2019re calling a referendum on this issue, you\u2019ve immediately said you\u2019re not going to express your opinions, and\nthen you do.\nAnd on admitting that you came across as a bellend at the con-ference, way to represent Imperial!\n- Anonymous\nWhy shouldn\u2019t the President have a view on NUS?\nShame that the vote will distract from the Sabb elections. The\nNUS is a bloated organisation sta\ufb00ed by under occupied third\nsector types, some of whom will be dispatched to campaign at Imperial so their employer can trouser \u00a360k of our money. I hope\nICU makes sure they are prevented from doing so as there is no\nequivalent resource for the No campaign.\n- Anonymous\n---In response to \u201cReligion for Atheists\u201d, 11th January:\nThanks very much for coming. I am so glad you liked it in the\nmain. We were delighted by the turn out and overwhelmed with\nthe response. So many great things were said afterwards, with so\nmuch help o\ufb00ered.\nYou totally hit the nail on the head when you said it is a work\nin progress. We went for this format because it was something\nwith which everyone was familiar, and to save time.\nWe could have wasted years coming up with some totally new\nthing that was just right. Or, we could start with the something\nthat worked, then improve it every week, with feedback from the\ncongregation.\nYep. It\u2019s a peer reviewed service.\nThe main thing that I have to answer is the whole \u2018pseudoscience\u2019 and \u2018self-help\u2019 things you wrote about. I will go into the\nspeci\ufb01c details later, but what I have to say is this: we will try to\nensure any tool, tip or way of thinking we put forward is evidence\nbased and transparent.\nScienti\ufb01c atheists, do not worry. This is a safe place for you.\n- Sanderson Jones\n---In response to \u201cBusiness School Set Exams in Breach of College Rules\u201d, 18th January\nThe comment from Laura McConnell is clearly a cop-out, if\nthe exams managers in the BS did their job properly and followed up available space from other departments they would\neasily find an appropriate room on Campus. I also understand from my fellow students that at times the BS has conducted its exams off campus during the day which is allowed\nunder College rules. This really shows the lack of professionalism the BS show for their own students and of those for other departments. Sad really considering the amount in fees us\nstudents pay. It\u2019s about time the School put more emphasis on\nthe needs of it\u2019s students.\n- Anonymous\nhttp://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1777\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\nThe Manifesto Review\nwarn you now that this article\nis a bit dry but that is just the\nway I am.\nI ran for the Deputy President (Education) role as I really enjoyed the Chemistry Dep Rep position and loved voicing the students\u2019\npoint of view. I also found the subject\nof higher education very interesting\nwhen reading random articles on BBC\nnews.\nFrom being DPE I have learnt how\nto use Microsoft Outlook extensively,\norganise my time between soooo many\nmeetings, committee meeting eti-quette, how a world leading university\noperates and coordinating a team of\ndevoted academic reps.\nThe one thing I wasn\u2019t expecting\nthough was the large number of long\nmeetings I had to attend so there is student representation and the national\nQuality Assurance Agency is happy\n(they decide whether an institution can\naward degrees or not). However it is\ncrucial that a student representative is\npresent at these meetings and I do get a\nbetter oversight of what is taking place\nacross the College.\nMy manifesto review is on the right\nand hopefully you are glad you voted\nfor me and not RON.\nDoug Hunt , Deputy President (Education) wasn\u2019t a mug and\nvoted for Doug. He sees what he has and hasn\u2019t done this year...\nAutumn SOLE got a 67% overall turnout across the College, which is the highest it\u2019s been in years. Departmental staff across the College are taking SOLE\nmore seriously now, than they did a few years ago and in every department\nthey push you to fill it in.\nHowever, the academic rep system also did its part to increase the participation rates, as I sent out daily year by year breakdown of participation rates to\nthe Dep Reps and sent this information to the year reps three times a week. I\nalso worked with ICT to get pop-ups appearing on login for those students who\nhad not started SOLE in the second week.\nHowever, I feel the participation rate can be improved upon for spring and\nsummer SOLE, so I will be finding more inventive ways for this to happen.\nTo make sure the results are shown to academic reps, I will be producing a\npaper on Staff Student Committees, which will go to the College\u2019s Quality Assurance and Enhancement Committee and this will state whether SOLE is being discussed.\n\u201cIncrease SOLE participation rates across\nthe college and make sure the results are\nacted upon.\u201d\nI\nI am still planning on doing this but with an added feature for all students to\nuse to help them study.\n\u201cImprove graduate prospects by creating\nan Imperial student forum for internships and year in industry placements.\u201d\nI initially submitted a paper to Faculty of Natural Sciences (FoNS) Teaching\nCommittee, as I was invited to give a presentation, as all departments in FoNS\n(apart from Chemistry) only have year abroad partners in Europe. This paper\nmeant that the Director of Postgraduate Studies in Physics also attended the\nRector\u2019s trip to the USA and she asked the universities they attended about\npotential studying abroad schemes.\nI also ran an International Mobility survey in November and the report\nshould be available in the next few weeks, which I plan to submit to interested\nparties and the College\u2019s Strategic Education Committee.\n\u201cEncourage faculties and departments to\nset up exchange programmes with other\nworld class universities outside Europe.\u201d\nIn November 2012 I coordinated a Rep Week, which saw academic reps wearing\nbrightrep\u201cLoveyourrep\u201dt-shirtsandwemanagedtocollect448suggestions,which\nwerethensenttotheirrepstobringupatstaff-studentcommittees.Thisallowedyou\ntoeasilyidentifyyourrepsinperson,ratherthanjustbyemail.Ialsogotpersonalised\npolosforyourDepRepsandFacultyUnionAcademicOfficersatthestartoftheyear.\nInadditiontothis,IaskedeachDepartmentalSocietycommitteetosetupaFreshers\u2019 Facebook group in Easter 2012, in order for there to be a greater sense of community within each year and allows your academic reps to communicate with you\nviaadifferentmedium.\nThe A-Z reps system was also launched in November, which allows any student\nto find any academic rep in any department and is regularly updated. If you log into\nImperial College Union\u2019s website it will even show you who your rep is on the \u201cYour\nUnion\u201dpage.\n\u201cRaise awareness of student\nrepresentation\u201d\nIn the 2011 student experience survey 87% of undergraduate respondents\nstated they wanted exam feedback via their personal tutor. This already\ntakes place within life sciences and I stated this as good practise in the 2012\nNSS Response.\nAs part of the Pro Rector (Education)\u2019s consultation process for Imperial\u2019s\neducational strategy, she is including the academic representatives\u2019\nopinion on the Education and Representation Board (both UG\nand PG). Within this group I have given them the chance to\nsay whether they think the College should adopt this level\nof exam feedback and the Pro Rector (Education) can take\nthis into consideration.\n\u201cWork towards achieving personalised\nfeedback on exams through personal\ntutor meetings.\u201d\nLecture podcasts\nSo at the end of the last academic year, the College publicly stated that it plans\nto roll out audio and video lecture podcasts. This is taking place over the next\nfew years but students are generally disgruntled by the speed this is happen-ing. ICT are rolling it out at a steady pace as they wish to ensure the quality of\nthe service e.g. make sure they can handle the large amount of data uploaded\nevery day. Paul and I both gave the College silver with respect to this in the NSS\nresponse for the slow rolling out pace and have had a meeting with ICT regarding this issue, reiterating that students aren\u2019t happy with it taking so long.\nMums and Dads\nThis year the buddy scheme was rebranded as Mums and Dads, which saw the\nhighest percentages of Freshers entering their data and the highest number of\nparents signing up to the scheme. This was accomplished by me working with the\nDepartmental Societies and Dep Reps over the summer. This also would not have\nbeen possible without the Union System Administrator, Philip Kent setting up the\nonline matching system and showing the live percentages by subject (this proved\nvery useful for the Dep Socs and Dep Reps).\nAtthestartoftermIattendedtheICSMSUMumsandDadseventtofindanygood\npractise, which I found a lot of.

    "content": "Issue 1537\nSPORT\nWolverine 1s Smashed by 2s\nSteve Ndumbe Dodgeball President\nFelix Sport learns of the strange goings on at IC Dodgeball...\nOn Sunday 13th January, the Wolverines set o\ufb00 for Essex with 3 teams\nready to hit their \ufb01rst tournament of\n2013 in force. In a \ufb01rst in the club\u2019s\nhistory, there were no delays in setting o\ufb00, nor incidents on the way\nthere (minus Scott Esnouf\u2019s typical\nminibus stalling, mind).\nThe day started o\ufb00 with a shock re-sult, as the Imperial 2nds wiped the\n\ufb02oor with one of the best teams in the\ncountry and the club\u2019s newest rivals,\nThe Meteors. The 2nds had achieved\nwhat the 1sts had failed to do in their\nprevious 4 encounters against The\nMeteors; was this a sign of things to\ncome? Aided by the insane throws\nof Jan Kosco, coaxed out of dodgeball retirement with a \u201cparticularly\nlawyer-ish Facebook message\u201d and\nZain Abbas\u2019s tremendous catching \u2013\nreaching the club record of 4 catches\nin one game \u2013 the 2nds triumphed\n4-1 and ended up progressing to\nthe quarter \ufb01nals at the top of their\ngroup.\nDue to one of the clubs pulling out\nat the last minute, the 1sts had to play\nthe UCL Pumas twice in the group\nstages. Rest assured the inferior university team was duly beaten not only\nby the 1sts twice, but also by the 2nds\nin the quarter \ufb01nal. The 1st team then\nfaced The Meteors in the quarter-\ufb01nal. Fuelled with the con\ufb01dence that\nif their 2nd team could beat The Meteors, then surely they could too, the\n1sts eventually managed to progress\nto the semi-\ufb01nals, thanks to some\nsolid catching from Edmund Teo.\nThe Imperial 3rd team were unluckily in a group of top tier teams,\nunfortunately losing all three of their\nmatches against strong opposition.\nHowever, they showed impressive\nperseverance through the group\nstages, even if Scott Esnouf decided\nit would be a good idea to tell them\na few days before that they were basically screwed. Their \ufb01nal match of\nthe day, the positional play-o\ufb00 was\nagainst a new team called \u201cThe Special Bus\u201d, appropriately dressed in\npyjamas. This match served two pur-poses: the \ufb01rst was to show how peer\npressure can easily a\ufb00ect the referee\u2019s\ndecision. In one of the games, despite\nthe \ufb01nal opposing player being clearly hit on the foot, repeated calls from\nthe ever-growing crowd (including\nthat of the Imperial 1st and 2nd team)\nthat \u201cit bounced\u201d caused the referee\nto simply allow play to continue. The\nsecond was to show how bad the 3rd\nteam are at \u2018suicide\u2019 throws. Notably pitiful attempts included Kunal\nSharma literally walking through the\ndeadzone area in the middle of the\ncourt, and Iacopo Russo getting good\nelevation in a jump, and then failing\nto displace the ball further than a few\ninches from himself. Their e\ufb00orts\nwere initially so bad that in the penultimate game all 6 players suicided and\nall 6 players missed, causing them to\nconcede that game (admittedly this\nwas the same game that the crowd\ndecided they would referee instead,\nbut let\u2019s skip over that). Thankfully\nCyprien de Saint Guilhem sorted out\na half-decent technique, and \ufb01nally\npulled o\ufb00 a successful suicide in the\nnext game to end their day.\nBoth the 1sts and the 2nds lost\ntheir semi-\ufb01nal matches, and so the\n\ufb01nal match of the day for the Wolverines Club was the 3rd/4th playo\ufb00 between the 1sts and the 2nds.\nThis was easily the most anticipated\nmatchup of the day, as this was the\n\ufb01rst time the two teams had ever\nmet in a tournament before. Previous\nfriendly matches in training had seen\nthe 2nds put up a strong \ufb01ght against\nthe 1sts; even then, no one could have\npredicted how strong the \ufb01ght they\nwould be putting up this time. Even\nThomas Delteil, who had gotten so\nbored with the day\u2019s proceedings that\nhe decided to crack out some classic\nFrench literature, was enthralled at\nwhat happened next.\nIt all started with a simple catch\nfrom Nuno Cunha, e\ufb00ortlessly silencing Steve Ndumbe\u2019s e\ufb00orts to take\nhim out. This was swiftly followed by\nWill Robinson\u2019s cries of \u201cshit shit shit\u201d\nas Jan Kosco unleashed a blistering\nthrow in his direction. Despite this,\nthe 1sts went 2-0 up, only needing\none more game to secure the Bronze\nmedal. However, the 2nd team then\ntook the next two games to make it\n2-2, helped with some strong words\nof encouragement from ex-2nd team\nVice-Captain Zain Abbas, and top-class leadership from 2nd team Captain Justin Ioanna. What happened in\nthe \ufb01nal game can only be described\nas magical. More speci\ufb01cally, James\nStrang\u2019s mid-air mid-court catch of\nThomas Peake, easily the pivotal moment in the whole match, could only\nbe described as awe-inspiring. It was\nthen and only then that the 1sts knew\nthey had been beaten. Despite last-gasp e\ufb00orts from Steve Ndumbe and\nScott Esnouf to bring the game back,\nthe 2nds eventually picked o\ufb00 all\nsix fellow club members, with some\nstrong throwing from Kennard Seah,\nto secure their \ufb01rst ever Bronze medal in an Open tournament.\nMan of the tournament for the 3rds\nwas a draw between Iacopo Russo\nand Digant Tyagi for their superb\ncatching. Man of the tournament for\nthe 2nds, and easily for all 3 teams\nwas Jan Kosco, whose fearsome\nthrowing capabilities had been sorely\nmissed. There was no similar vote for\nthe 1st team, but it probably wouldn\u2019t\nhave gone to Alan Soltani for spending 20 minutes almost crying in the\nshower after the fatal loss, or to Scott\nEsnouf for coming up with every excuse under the sun as to the unbelievable result.\nAnd as much as I would love to rewrite this report and claim that the\n1sts beat the 2nds after all, I daresay\nThomas Bell\u2019s thorough documentation of the day via the Imperial\nWolverines Twitter account would\neasily hamper my e\ufb00orts. After all,\n#thebesttruthisanembellishedone.\nNot even Zain and Nuno could save the day for the 1\u2019s....\n*Send us a different picture dodgeball!\nNo medals for Steve.\n\u201cKeep the Cat Free\u201d\nfelixonline.co.uk\n25/01/13\n@SportFelix\n\n"

In fact\nmost large companies now either actively support young entrepreneurs,\nor at least perceive entrepreneurship\nas a desirable trait. Being involved in a\nsocial enterprise at university doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily tie you to a career path\nin entrepreneurship and more likely\nthan not is likely to aid your application to any job! The key message here\nis that social enterprise at university\nis not just something that those wanting to \u2018become entrepreneurs\u2019 should\nexplore. It can be fun, interesting and\nrewarding for everyone.\nThe Venture Catalyst\nChallenge \u201813\nUniversity is a great time to get involved in new projects and experiment with things that may be outside of your comfort zone. Maybe\nyou can\u2019t fail your degree, but you\ncan certainly try to learn a new\nsport, a new language or join a new\nsociety with absolutely no pressure\nto be good at it. Trying to start your\nown social enterprise should be no\ndifferent.\nThat\u2019s why this year ICStartup\n(a collaboration between Imperial\nHub, Imperial Innovations and Imperial Entrepreneurs) is bringing\nyou the Venture Catalyst Challenge,\nyour chance to develop an enterprise idea. This year the focus is\non digital and social enterprise. It\u2019s\noffering students the chance to win\nanything from \u00a3500 to \u00a3250K to develop their idea, as well as providing\nexpert support and advice via free\nworkshops and masterclasses.\nImperial Hub is responsible for\nthe social enterprise aspect of the\ncompetition. Entrants are encouraged to submit an idea for any UK\nbased social enterprise and to be\nas creative as possible. However,\nImperial Hub has highlighted three\nsocial issues in the following areas\nthat may help spark your imagina-tion.\n\u2022 Food\n\u2022 Consumption\n\u2022 The Elderly\n(See poster (right) for more de-tails.)\nAll you need to do is submit an\nidea by the 28th January to www.ic-startup.com/vc and then ICStartup\nwill help you develop it!

    "content": "A Damn Fine Cup of Coffee\nEdward Bals takes us back to the 90s with Twin Peaks\nwin Peaks manages to\ndo the almost impos-sible; mixing sex, vio-lence, mystery and even\nthe odd dosage of the\nsupernatural into a heady whirlwind that is sure to draw you in to\nits strange world. The series itself\nis from the early \u201890s and has been\nrecommended to me time and time\nagain by my family and other people\nof that same, shall we say, \u2018mature\u2019\nage.\nThe show is set in a small town\nclose in North America called Twin\nPeaks, opening with the discovery\nof the body of the local homecoming queen, Laura Palmer. The question of \u2018who killed Laura Palmer?\u2019\nbecomes the driving force behind\nthe story, slowly unravelling the\nfibre of the seemingly idyllic small\ntown life. The show doesn\u2019t play out\nas a straight up whodunit, but rather as a sort of surreal soap opera,\nwith its fair share of love triangles\nand intersecting storylines.\nThe idea for the series came from\nthe minds of David Lynch and Mark\nFrost. Lynch was the mind behind\nfilms like Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, and in Twin Peaks his\nsurrealistic touch is apparent, with\nTwin Peaks mixing this surrealism with small town American life.\nThe combination doesn\u2019t necessarily sound like it should work but it\nmakes for compelling watching.\nThe show also brings us the brilliant Kyle MacLachlan (former star\nof Lynch\u2019s Blue Velvet and Dune)\nas FBI special agent Dale Cooper\nwho is called in to investigate the\ndeath of Laura Palmer. MacLachlan\nmanages to walk the knife edge of\nstraight faced acting even whilst\nexploring some of Cooper\u2019s odder\ncharacter quirks. Cooper\u2019s inherent\noddness is best displayed by his explanation of coming by a new crime\nsolving technique, which also made\nhim aware of the plight of the Tibetan people. I did say that the show\ndoes become a bit surreal at times.\nThe music is excellent as well,\nwith its haunting themes and cool\njazz perfectly complementing the\nmood of the series. \u2018Laura\u2019s Theme\u2019\nis suitably haunting and is used, re-peatedly, to great effect throughout\nthe series, and the fact that this can\nbe reused to evoke so many different feelings is a testament to the genius of the composer of the music\nfor the series, Angelo Badalamenti.\nJulee Cruise also deserves a mention for her ethereal vocals, complementing Badalamenti\u2019s music.\nThe show remains engaging\nthroughout the whole first series\nwith the most cliff-hanger filled\nending to a series that I have ever\nseen, and the second season, despite a small dip in quality during\nthe middle, is generally very good,\nwith the last few episodes being especially noteworthy.\nThe best format in which to get\nthe show is its Gold Box Edition,\nwhich contains the two series, both\nversions of the pilot episode and a\nbundle of special features for all of\nyou people out there who have too\nmuch time on their hands. \u2018A Slice\nof Lynch\u2019 is one of the better offerings from the special features,\nbringing David Lynch together with\nsome of the main cast characters to\nreminisce about the series.\nT\nThe end of January is \ufb01nally approach-ing, bringing with it two wonderful\nthings: 1. exams are almost over and\n2. all of our favourite shows are back\nwith new episodes after the winter\nbreak!\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy continues to be\nmelodramatic and entertaining. I can\nalways rely on the doctors from Seattle Grace Hospital to be annoying and\nendearing at the same time. Regular\nviewers of the show know that the episodes are driven by the relationships\nbetween the characters and I\u2019m happy\nto see Callie and Arizona, as well as\nCristina and Owen being happy together again.\nHow I Met Your Mother has been\nrenewed for one more, \ufb01nal, season \u2013\nyay! There is a light at the end of the\ntunnel as we get ever closer to the big\nreveal. The latest episode sees Barney\ngoing through \u2018one night stand withdrawal\u2019 and Lily and Marshall looking\nfor ways to spice up their sex life after\nthe birth of their \ufb01rst child. Overall it\nwas a very enjoyable episode.\nSmash is back \u2013 kind of. The actual\nseason premiere isn\u2019t until the 6th\nof February but the \ufb01rst episode was\nleaked and the second season looks\nlike it\u2019s going to be just as good as, if\nnot better, than the \ufb01rst one. The music and singing continue to be amaz-ing.\nThe Big Bang Theory takes the top\nspot yet again. I know many people\nhave tired of this show, but I still really enjoy it and the latest episode\nwas one of the best this season. It was\nwonderful to see Penny, Bernadette\nand Amy read comic books to understand why their boyfriends love them\nso much. I can de\ufb01nitely relate to the\nheated discussion that follows.\nA deep vein of surrealism\nMy Top 5 Episodes of the Week\nLucia Podhorska\nTELEVISION Television Editor: Lucia Podhorska\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\n34\nWelcome back to my weekly feature\nTelevision Editor\n1.

The all sta\ufb00 count excludes\natypical sta\ufb00. 181,385 (48.0%) were\nacademic professionals compared to\n181,185 (47.5%) in 2010. In 2011 the\npercentages of female sta\ufb00 remained\nconstant from last year, with 46.9% of\nfull-time sta\ufb00 and 67.0% of part-time\nsta\ufb00. However, there was an increase\nin the number of females with managerial positions, with 8,740 in 2011\nand 8,770 in 2010. In addition, there\nwas a decrease in the number of females employed as laboratory, engi-neering, building and IT technicians.\nAcademic Staff\nDespite the overall decrease in higher\neducation sta\ufb00, there was actually a\n0.5% increase in academic sta\ufb00, with\n200 more than the previous year.\nThere was an increase in female academic sta\ufb00 from the previous year;\nwith 80,775 (44.5%) female academic\nsta\ufb00 in 2011 compared to 80,090\n(44.2%) in 2010. There was a 5.7% increase in the number of academic sta\ufb00\nemployed as professors, with 18,465\nin 2011 and 17,465 in 2010. The most\nnotable change was the 9.7% increase\nin female professors, there were 3,790\nin 2011 and only 3,455 in 2010. Consequently, the proportion of women\nwho are now professors is 20.5%. This\nincrease seen by female professors is\nmore than double the rise seen by the\nprevious year (2010-2011 from 2009-2010) at 4.1%.\nFurthermore, in comparison to\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIncreaseinthenumberoffemaleprofessorsforthesecondyearinarow\nNida Mahmud News Editor\n2008-2009, there has been a 5.3% increase in professors, with 930 more\nprofessors now employed in UK\nhigher education institutions. Additionally, there has been a 16% rise in\nthe number of female professors from\n2008-2009, with their currently being\n520 more employed in UK higher edu-cation.\nTaking a look at the academic sta\ufb00\nresponsibilities, it can be seen the\nlargest increase was for employment\nin solely teaching roles, this sector\nshowed an increase of 820 employees\nto 45,825. There was also an increase\nin research sta\ufb00 and those employed\nfor both teaching as well as research.\nBBC News reported that the \u201cgeneral secretary of the University and\nCollege Union, Sally Hunt, welcomed\nthe increase in female professors but\nsaid there was more to be done\u201d. She\nsaid she is \u201cpleased that there has been\na rise in the number of female professors in the sector. However, universities still have more to do to ensure that\nsta\ufb00 are promoted on merit irrespective of their background or gender.\nStudents want to be taught by the best\nand brightest, and sta\ufb00 want to work\nin universities where gender is not\nan issue when it comes to career advancement.\u201d\nThe number of Non-EU postgraduate applicants has fallen for the \ufb01rst\ntime in 16 years. In previous years\nthe numbers had risen annually by an\naverage of more than 10%. Figures released by the Higher Education Statistical Agency (Hesa) shows a 1% drop\nfuelling ideas that the government\u2019s\nimmigration crackdown is deterring\nstudents continuing their education in\nthe UK.\nThe drop, from 174,225 to 173,560,\nwas the \ufb01rst fall since such Hesa data\nbegan in 1995. The total number of\nuniversity applicants for 2012 has decreased by 7.4% compared to the previous year along with a decrease in the\nnumber of EU applicants by 11.2%.\nJo Beall, British Council Director of\nEducation and Society, said \u201cthe sector\nwas expecting a decline in growth, but\nthe actual reduction in postgraduate\nnumbers is of real concern as international students make up the majority of numbers in many postgraduate\ncourses and research teams in science,\ntechnology engineering and math-ematics.\n\u201cAttracting the brightest and most\nambitious postgraduate and research\nstudents is critical if the UK is to\nmaintain its quality reputation for research and innovation,\u201d Beall said.\nThe government aims to cut down\nnet migration to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d by 2015 and there are fears that\nthis will a\ufb00ect international students\nthat want to study in the UK. Mark\nHarper, the Immigration Minister, denied calls from universities to remove\noverseas students from the net migrant count. He said there is no \u201clogical reason\u201d to make the change.\nUniversities UK has told the government that they should remove international students who are sponsored\nby universities from the net migration\ncount so that these universities are\nspared from the government\u2019s plans.\nHowever, when asked if he could\nenvisage a situation where the government could make this change, Mr\nHarper issued a \u201cno\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThe international de\ufb01nition that\u2019s used is that if you change\nyour country of residence for more\nthan a year, you are a migrant. Frankly,\nif we weren\u2019t going to count students,\nit\u2019s not obvious why we wouldn\u2019t count\nlots of other people.\u201d\nYes, [the students are] paying fees to\ncome here, but in the same way someone coming here to work for a private\nsector employer is contributing to that\ncompany\u2019s economic success. I don\u2019t\nsee any logical reason why we would\ntreat them [overseas students] di\ufb00erently\u201d.\nEven though there has been a continual increase in the number of students coming to the UK from China,\nthere has been a drop in the number of\nstudents applying from both India and\nPakistan by 25% and 13% respectively.\nBeall said: \u201cThese statistics for the\n\ufb01rst time provide real evidence that\nthe changes to UK visa regulations\nmay have dissuaded many students\nfrom applying to the UK, and in particular postgraduate students who are\nso important to the UK\u2019s research out-put. The UK enjoys an excellent reputation around the world for the high\nquality of our education system, so\nthe government needs to ensure that\ninstitutions have all the support they\nneed to attract international students\nwho make a tremendous academic,\ncultural and economic contribution to\nthe UK.\u201d\nInternational PG applications down\nApplications have fallen for the first time in 16 years\nAemun Reza News Editor\nArrivals gate as\ninternational\nstudents arrive.

    "content": "Quadruple DNA? Go home\nDNA, you\u2019re drunk\nSCIENCE\nA treatment for women vulnerable to miscarriages?\nKeir Little Science Writer\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\nPhilippa Skett thinks DNA are now causing a scene and need to be sent home in a taxi\nhe traditional double helix con\ufb01guration of every\nbiologist\u2019s favourite acid,\nDNA, is a common sight\nin the media. It\u2019s on textbook covers, in adverts and even in\nlogos attempting to convey scienti\ufb01c\nsuperiority, but which are really playing on the naivety of the general public (anti-aging creams, I am looking at\nyou). The dual swirl has been incredibly romanticised since its discovery\nby the biology big shots James Watson\nand Francis Crick, but new research\nis showing that this structure may not\nbe all that DNA has up its molecular\nsleeve.\nChemists at Cambridge University,\nwhere the classical double helix structure was discovered almost 60 years\nago to the day, have \ufb01nally identi\ufb01ed\nthe quadruple helix structure of DNA\nin human cells. These structures,\ncalled the G-quadruplexes, form when\nfour guanines (one of the four chemical groups that make up DNA) lie in\na planar arrangement between four\nstrands of the DNA backbone.\nData published this week in Nature,\nby the wonderfully named Dr Shankar\nBalasubramanian and his researchers\nshows how they have targeted \ufb02uorescent antibodies to the G-quadruplex\nand identi\ufb01ed them in genetic regions\nthat have high proportions of guanine,\nmaking this the \ufb01rst time these have\nbeen visualised in human tissue.\nBut what do these structural wonders do, if anything? They have previously been found in telomeres, the\nend of the chromosomes that shorten\nwith each cellular division. Telomeres\nare sort of like the genetic countdown\nto death, and are part of the reason we\naren\u2019t immortal. As each cell divides, a\nlittle bit of each chromosome doesn\u2019t\nmake it to the next cell due to the enzymatic limitations that allow cell division to occur.\nTelomeres are the cleaver little non-coding genetic martyrs that sacri\ufb01ce\nthemselves to ensure precious coding\nDNA doesn\u2019t disappear, as they shorten instead. This shortening actually\nleads to a limitation in life span \u2013 as\na telomere shortens to a certain point,\ncells may enter a state of \u201cold age,\u201d or\ndie completely. When many cells do\nthis, it can lead to organ deterioration\nor cause many of the diseases associated with old age.\nOne idea is that G-quadruplexes\nmay stop enzymes accessing the telomere after replication. Telomerase is\none such enzyme \u2013 this replaces any\nDNA lost at the end of the chromosome and almost reverses the genetic\ncountdown as the chromosomes no\nlonger shorten. With this in mind, inhibition of telomerase could be seen\nas detrimental to cellular longevity, although too much of telomerase activity can also lead to cancerous growth.\nIt may be therefore that the G-quadruplex acts a mediator between too\nmuch or too little telomerase action,\nand maintains healthy growth levels.\nOther functions are being discussed\ntoo such as the role they have in controlling gene expression, but such\nspeculation is in need of some hard\nevidence to prove once and for all\nT\nResearchers at Imperial College and\nthe University of Warwick have identi\ufb01ed molecular signals produced\nby cells in the womb saying whether\nan embryo can implant there or not,\nand suggest that drugs a\ufb00ecting these\nsignals could be used to treat women\nvulnerable to miscarriages.\nA fertilised embryo must embed itself in the uterus during a speci\ufb01c few\ndays in the menstrual cycle for proper\ndevelopment. Previously, it was unclear how endometrial cells control\nthe time during which they are receptive to embryos, and how they signal\nthis receptiveness. A recent investigation into the chemicals produced\nby endometrial cells has found that\na molecule called IL-33 is secreted\nduring the receptive period, which\nregulates in\ufb02ammatory and immune\nresponses in nearby cells.\nUsually, this molecule is secreted\nbrie\ufb02y, allowing embryo implantation\nonly during the correct time in the\nmenstrual cycle. However, the study\nfound that in women who had suffered several miscarriages, IL-33 is secreted for up to 10 days, showing the\nendometrium is receptive even when\nit is not ready for embryo develop-ment.\nThe study also investigated the effect of these molecular signals in\nmice. Mouse uteri were treated with\nhuman endometrial secretions, which\nincreased the period during which the\nmice could become pregnant while\nalso increasing the likeliness of mis-carriage, supporting the theory that\nthe signals are responsible for multiple miscarriages in humans.\nFurther research into the IL-33 molecule and drugs that block its action\nmay lead to new treatments for women who have su\ufb00ered miscarriages.\nThe researcher leading the study, Professor Jan Brosens of Warwick, said,\n\u201cthe molecular signals we identi\ufb01ed\nare known to be involved in a range of\ndiseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, asthma and heart disease. Our \ufb01ndings\nsuggest that targeting these molecules\nmight also be a promising strategy\nfor developing treatments that would\nprevent miscarriages in women who\nare especially vulnerable.\u201d\nDude, I swear, that\u2019s totally the\nnerd gene right there\nwhat these quadruple helices actually\ndo. For now, it seems that Dr Shankar\nBalasubramanian and his researchers\nwork is not over. Although we have\ncome a long way since Watson, Crick\nand their Cavendish chums poured\nover their draft structures at the Eagle\npub in Cambridge, we still have a long\nway in understanding the more intricate details of the genetic code.\nDOI: 10.1038/nchem.1548\nQuadruple DNA\n\n"

Encouraging people\nto sign the petition Dr Diaz-Cintas\nemphasised that, \u201cWith a track record of 12 years of large-scale MSc\nteaching and PhD provision, the\nTSU has established itself as a strong\nplayer within the College, with very\nhealthy recruitment, particularly of\noverseas students, at both MSc and\nPhD levels, and a strong provision\nof further complementary activities\u201d.\nArguing against any proposed move\nof the unit he claimed out that with\nits \u201cstrongly technical and scienti\ufb01c\npro\ufb01le\u201d the College was the \u201cmost\nnatural home\u201d for a department specialising in technical translation.\nThe petition attracted over 2,500\nsupporters in its \ufb01rst 48 hours and,\nat the time of going to print, was\njust over 260 signatures o\ufb00 meeting\nits target of 5,000. Signatories have\npraised the Units \u201cunique contribution\u201d to technical translation and\nhave called it a \u201cfundamental point of\nreference\u201d of the \ufb01eld.\nIt is unclear what would happen\nto PhD students\nin the middle\nof their degrees\nshould the TSU close and these students have been particularly vocal in\ntheir concerns. Lindsay Bywood told\nFelix of her disappointment at how\n\u201cPhD students and part-time MSc\nstudents are being cast adrift by the\nCollege in the middle of their courses\u201d, asserting that \u201can award of an Imperial degree is pretty meaningless\nwhen I have no idea what sort of su-pervision, library, and facilities support I will receive for the next three\nyears of my research\u201d.\nThis is a view shared by Renata\nMliczak, who believes that \u201cthe plans\nof the Management Board at IC are\ntruly inconsiderate of all the TSU\nstudents\u201d. She added that while it\nwas clear that \u201cacademics around the\nworld see the importance of the work\nand research conducted by IC TSU\nscholars, it is a big shame that IC\ncannot see and appreciate\nit\u201d. She asserts that the\nproposed closure acts\n\u201cas a message to the\nworld that IC is not\ninterested in disseminating (through trans-lation) the great research that is done here\nin medicine, engineering\nand natural sciences,\nbut doing it for its own sake\u201d with\nSoledad Zarate, another PhD stu-dent, further questioning how \u201can institution of such high calibre, home\nto students coming from all over\nthe world, [does] not recognise that\ntranslation is vital for the transferral\nof knowledge and research between\ncultures worldwide\u201d.\nConcerns have also been raised\nabout how the closure might devalue degrees that have already been\nawarded, with Emmanouela Patiniotaki fearing that after the TSU\u2019s\n\u201cclosure or transferral the validity of\nour degree in the translation industry will be questioned\u201d. Yuan Long\nconcurs, adding that with \u201ccurrent\ngloomy picture of economy\u201d employers might consider a quali\ufb01cation\nfrom a \u201cTranslation Unit at Imperial\nwhich no longer exists\u201d to have been\ndiscredited.\nIn a statement given to Felix\nthe College\u2019s communication\no\ufb03ce said: \u201cThe consultation\nfollows a review by Imperial\u2019s\nManagement Board, which\nregularly evaluates the strategic \ufb01t of all parts of the College. Following the review of the\nTSU, Management Board agreed\nthat the Unit\u2019s activities are\nnot core to Imperial\u2019s strategy.\n\u201cIt also proposed that the\npossibility of the Unit becoming established in an alternative academic\nenvironment be explored, with a better institutional \ufb01t where the TSU\ncould form part of a larger and therefore more sustainable department.\n\u2026 The Management Board agreed\nthat a priority would be to protect\nthe position of students currently\nregistered in the Unit. Regardless of\nthe outcome of the consultation, all\nTSU students will be able to continue\nto work towards an Imperial College\ndegree.\u201d\nDr Diaz-Cintas, Head of the\nTranslation Unit is strongly\nopposed to the closure\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nEoghan J Totten Reporter\nThe petition to keep the Translation\nStudies Unit in Imperial College\nA filler image of The Mingle this year.

It\u2019s balanced out by the\nfact that the aliens can attack from any\nangle, so it\u2019s a little harder than it \ufb01rst\nseems. The earlier missions feel like\nyour run-of-the-mill tower defence,\nbut quite soon you\u2019re having to alternate between dragging your satellites\ninto range of the UFOs, and away from\nenemy \ufb01re.\nSome tower defence games, such as\nRevenge of the Titans, keep your re-search/upgrade choices throughout\nthe cam-paign, which\ncan be a bit of a\npain, when you realise\nyou\u2019ve been barking up the wrong\n(research) tree, for the last \ufb01ve mis-sions, because the whole thing is con-fusing. TUG makes you work for your\nrather simple upgrade points \u2013 they\naren\u2019t handed out like some sort of intergalactic candy \u2013 instead you\u2019ll need\nto place research stations around your\nplanet to \ufb01ll up your research bar. If\nthe mission \ufb01nishes and the bar is full,\nyou get the medal and the point, to use\nas you wish. Finish all of the missions\nobjectives (i.e. none of your satellites\nare destroyed) and you\u2019ll unlock the\nmission for the challenge mode.\nThe well-balanced di\ufb03culty modes\nwill keep you playing for a long time,\nand it\u2019s not too gimmicky to bore you\nbefore you \ufb01nish.\nUnusually for a tower defence game,\nthe cut-scenes are really fun to watch\nand actually bring something to the\ngame. It adds a sense of 50\u2019s immer-sion, akin to Fallout 3 & New Vegas. I\u2019d\nheartily recommend this game to anyone who\u2019s interested in tower defence\ngames.\nWell, now that\u2019s over. Let the probing begin.\nA\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\n42\nA bit that will really drive you a long way\nHah \u2013 you thought that you would escape my zombie fanaticissm this week,\nbut you haven\u2019t! This week\u2019s selection\nis Zombie Driver, the spiritual sequel to\nZombie Chau\ufb00eur, the game adaptation\nof the BAFTA winning Driving Miss\nZombie.\nDisappointingly, your exploits are\nnot narrated by Morgan Freeman as\nyou crush zombies under your wheels,\nbut hey, I expect he was too busy recording the voice of Gordon Freeman\nfor Half Life 3. Oh wait, there was an\nNDA about that. Oh well.\nSooo... Zombie Driver? Another\ngame from Excalibur Publishing, but\nunlike Zombie Chau\ufb00er, you\u2019re not a\nsauve, rotten corpse, taking customers to their BDSM parties, but instead\nyour job is to drive around a zombie-infested city.\nYour goal? To rescue school kids,\ndrunken sailors, paramedics, engi-neers, etc from the zombies in the\nstreet. The city is completely open\nplan, so you can drive anywhere you\nwant at any time you want, spending your time shooting zombies with\nmachine guns strapped to your cars,\nimmolating them with \ufb02amethrowers, and adding their \ufb02esh to your radiator with the nitro boost. As a slight\nnote, the survivors can get eaten by the\nawaiting horde if you take too long, so\ndon\u2019t enjoy the scenery too much.\nAs you progress through the \u2018story\u2019 you earn more and more money,\nthrough cash bundles throughout the\ncity, kill streaks, destruction of property and completing objectives. Each\nmission has a primary and secondary\nobjective, for example a primary mission would be \u201cRescue 4 paramedics\u201d\n,\nand the secondary would be \u201cRescue all\n6 paramedics\u201d\n.\nWell. this can be a bit of a dilem-ma, as your original car was not once\nowned by a clown, and has a limited\ncapacity for bodies. As you complete\nmore missions and more extra objec-tives, you unlock new weapons, upgrades and vehicles. The taxi, in which\nyou start, has a moderate capacity for 4\npassengers, and has okay stats (speed,\ndamage resistance and ability to keep\nyour inertia as you plough through the\nzombies). Soon after, you can unlock\nthe white limo \u2013 slower and tougher\nthan the taxi, but with a capcity of 6, so\nfor a bunch of missions, you might not\nhave to return to base in the middle, to\ndrop o\ufb00 the \ufb01rst survivors.\nMoney might seem to be a problem,\nbut once you\u2019ve picked up your sur-vivors, you can drive around the city,\nwithout a timer. As such, you could\nRoss Webster Oh God, it\u2019s CandlejThe Unstoppable Gorg\npossibly gather a horrendously large\npile of money that would put a dent in\nUS debt. See, I managed to throw politics into this week\u2019s games.\nThe graphics for the game are actually quite good, but we\u2019ve found a few\npeople who get motion sickness from\nthe game. I\u2019m assuming that this is a VSync (or rather a lack of VSync) issue, as\nthe game can move quite fast at times.\nI\u2019d recommend a decent computer if\nyou want nice visuals, without the barf\nbag. For those of you who don\u2019t know\nwhat VSync is, it\u2019s nothing to do with \u2018N\nSync. That would be horrible.\nIn-game sounds are \ufb01ne (it\u2019s hard to\ngo wrong with groaning, and screeching\ntires) but the voice acting leaves quite a\nbit to be desired, but hey, that\u2019s probably\nnot why you bought the game.\nSo, if you can \ufb01nd this game any-where, I\u2019d pick it up, as it\u2019s a feel-good,\nendorphin pumping game, that requires\nlittle thought, but is still kinda tricky to\npull o\ufb00 perfectly.\nUntil next week, it\u2019s bye bye bye from\nthe Games team! (FYI, I made up the\nZombie Chau\ufb00eur thing. And I\u2019m a spy.)\nTurn it off, TURN IT OFF!\nNow that\u2019s just cheating.\nImagine a mixture of Sins of\na Solar Empire, and this...\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBillie Piper and Dr. Who James\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY 29\nScience and art rarely seem to collaborate in popular culture (and we are not\ntalking about science \ufb01ction here). It is\na shame, because science is inherently\nintriguing without requiring the embellishment of artistic and creative in-put. So, when they are combined, they\nare a strong force of entertainment.\nThe E\ufb00ect is a play that brings together Connie and Tristan (Billie Piper and Jonjo O\u2019Neill) during a trial to\nunderstand the e\ufb00ects of a new dopa-mine-based treatment for depression\non healthy adults. They are under the\nsupervision of Dr James (Anastasia\nHille) who is battling against a de-pression, triggered by the immorality\nof both her present situation and her\npast history with ex-partner, Toby\n(Tom Goodman-Hill. This is the man\nwho has developed the drugs that are\nbeing used in the trial that she is over-seeing.\nThe strong cast was well suited to\nthe staging at the intimate Cottlesloe\nTheatre, the audience entirely surrounding the action and looking down\nupon the actors, who had no room for\nerrors. In any case, they did not commit any. Even Tristan\u2019s tap dance in an\ne\ufb00ort to woo Connie was perfect.\nWhat was more impressive, though,\nwas how thought-provoking the play\nwas. As the participants begin falling\nfor each other, Connie begins to question the love she feels for Tristan. Dr\nJames begins to question the ability\nof the drug, and both begin to question the signi\ufb01cance of the increased\nlevels of dopamine in the participants\u2019\nsystems.\nSpeculation is rife: which is the\ncause and which is the e\ufb00ect? For\nConnie, does it even matter?\nWhen Tristan ends up with transient global amnesia, he is no longer\nthe same man Connie fell for, and, although she still loves him, she begins\nto question what the basis of a human\nidentity is.\nAlthough this was a slightly obvious\ntack to take, the writing (Lucy Prebble) was easily the highlight of this\nplay, even more than so than the high\nquality acting and directing (Rupert\nGoold).\nEspecially intriguing was the character of Dr James. Her kind and genuinely caring and open\nnature towards\nTristan and Connie, doing everything she\ncould to reassure them\nas well as\ntaking responsibility\nfor Tristan\u2019s\namnesia, made\nher very easy to\nsympathise with.\nAfter building up such a strongly\npositive opinion of her, digesting her\ncontroversial opinions on the delicate\ntopic that is depression was particularly entertaining.\nTo her, depression is not a disease.\nMildly depressed people have a more\nrealistic view of the world, and are\nonly a\ufb00ected because they are freed\nof the delusions which keep healthy\nindividuals happy. Drugs cannot treat\ndepression because the underlying\n\u201cchemical imbalance\u201d causing it has\nnot been elucidated. The general public is not su\ufb03ciently educated on what\nlittle understanding has been gleaned\nfrom research. Drug companies exploit the relative ignorance of su\ufb00erers by o\ufb00ering drugs which inevitably\ncannot treat their depression. The idea\nof administering drugs for depression\nis as ridiculous to Dr James as the notion of the four humours.\nIt was controversial because these\nwere the opinions of a \u201cprofessional\u201d,\nwhich led to the audience pondering over how relevant they are to the\nthoughts of actual professionals on\nthe same topic.\nIt is interesting to note that such an\nopinion, and many other aspects of the\nplay are a freeze frame on the current\nattitudes, social and medical, towards\ndepression. More than most contemporary plays, The E\ufb00ect highlights a\ntopic of great signi\ufb01cance to our society today. By exploring depression,\nPrebble explores its re\ufb02ection of soci-ety. Whereas in a lot of contemporary\nwriting the present is conveyed via the\npast, or modern societal values are\nexplored in very obvious ways, Prebble\u2019s The E\ufb00ect is de\ufb01nitely something\nunique.\nIt was disappointing that the love\naspect of the storyline did not seem\nto be as carefully considered. It was\nonly a matter of days before the lead\ncharacters \u201cfell in love\u201d, which seemed\na little too Hollywood. Although I had\nno qualms with the idea that such\ncharacters felt strong infatuation,\ntheir process of falling in love was incredibly unbelievable and annoyingly\nunoriginal.\nFurthermore, if Connie is a student\nwho lives in a \u201cshit hole\u201d, how does she\nhave the capacity to bring home and\nsupport another adult with amnesia\ndue to last an inde\ufb01nite amount of\ntime?\nAside from the few\nblips, if anything (for\nscience students es-pecially) it is de\ufb01nitely worth going\nalong for the \u201cpsychology is not a\nreal science\u201d jokes.\nThe Effect is on at the National Theatre. Tickets from\n\u00a312. Until 23rd February.\nLily Le Writer\nWait... you\u2019re not\nChristopher Eccleston\n\n"

Yes\nLittle Miss Sunshine (2006)\nPrevious nominee? Yes\nThe Russians Are Coming! The\nRussians Are Coming (1966)\nThe Heart is a Lonely Hunter\n(1968)\nWhy he will win:\nHe is almost single-handedly\nresponsible for the comedy\naspect in Ben Affleck\u2019s thrilling\nnew critically acclaimed\nfilm. As a snarky Hollywood\nproducer who declares that\nif he\u2019s making a fake movie,\nit will be a fake hit, he is an\nabsolute pro in delivering his\ndry, sarcastic one-liners, giving\nthe film a lot of breathing\nroom.\nWhy he won\u2019t win:\nHe has not been winning any\nmajor awards for this role, just\na list of respectable noms.\nRobert De Niro\nSilver Linings Playbook\nPrevious winner? Yes\nThe Godfather: Part II (1974)\nRaging Bull (1980)\nPrevious nominee? Yes\nTaxi Driver (1976)\nThe Deer Hunter (1978)\nAwakenings (1990)\nCape Fear (1991)\nWhy he will win:\nDe Niro has been starring in\nsome terrible films of late,\nbut here is a role that is finally\nworthy of his name and talent.\nWhy he won\u2019t win:\nAgain, he hasn\u2019t been winning\nmany awards for this, and\nthis Oscar nomination was a\nnice surprise, but a surprise\nnonetheless. And he\u2019s a\ntwo-time winner already.\nRemember how long it took\nMeryl Streep to score her third\nOscar? De Niro might have to\nwait a few more years.\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman\nThe Master\nPrevious winner? Yes\nCapote (2005)\nPrevious nominee? Yes\nCharlie Wilson\u2019s War (2007)\nDoubt (2008)\nWhy he will win:\nThe Master was a big hit at the\n2011 Venice Film Festival, with\nboth Hoffman and Joaquin\nPhoenix jointly winning the\nBest Actor Award \u2013 both\ndeservingly so. In contrast to\nPhoenix\u2019s more intense, showy\nrole, Hoffman here puts on a\nvery much humble, intelligent\nperformance, with plenty\nof charisma, too, perfectly\nplausible as a man leading\na dodgy cult with complex\nphilosophical ideas.\nWhy he won\u2019t win:\nThe Master had fantastic buzz\n\u2013 back in September. But now,\nnot so much, next to nothing.\nTommy Lee Jones\nLincoln\nPrevious winner? Yes\nThe Fugitive (1993)\nPrevious nominee? Yes\nJFK (1991)\nIn the Valley of Elah (2007)\nWhy he will win:\nWith an immensely fun role\nin which he screams and\nshouts racial equality and\nstands out amongst a crowd\nof conservatives, Jones is a key\nsupporting player that makes\nLincoln work to its fullest\npotential. He has a number of\nrousing speeches to make, and\nis effective in delivering them.\nWhy he won\u2019t win:\nSnubbedbytheCritics\u2019Choice,\nhe didn\u2019t pick up the gong at\nthe Globes either. This is one\nheck of a competitive field\nthis year, and a general lack of\nsupport so far is not looking\ngood for the actor.\nChristoph Waltz\nDjango Unchained\nPrevious winner? Yes\nInglourious Basterds (2009)\nPrevious nominee? No\nWhy he will win:\nHe has a knack for playing\nhysterical anti-heroes and\nsnarky villains. He also seems\nto have been designed to\nstar in many, many Quentin\nTarantino productions, as\nhe competently rolls off the\nlengthy lines of dialogue the\neccentric director gives him.\nHe has a meaty role here, and\nhas won a Golden Globe so far.\nWhy he won\u2019t win:\nIs he a bit of a one-trick pony?\nPerhaps. He plays very simliar\ntypes (although incredibly\nwell) in a lot of his films (which\ncould also explain why he\nmakes such a good match with\nTarantino) \u2013 and maybe the\nvoters will pick up on that.\n\n"

Bigelow has managed to condense ten\nyears of complex, never-ending information and events regarding the hunt\nfor Osama bin Laden into a mere\n150-minute running time, whilst\nkeeping the pace healthy, suspense\nhigh, and realism intact. Instead the\n\ufb01lm has generated, and continues to\nstorm up its ever-growing number of\ndetractors and haters, most of whom\nhaven\u2019t even seen the \ufb01lm, criticising\nBigelow\u2019s portrayal of the use of torture sanctioned by the government\nto gather intelligence. Anti-Obama\npoliticians who supposedly have\nnothing better to do than to attack\nan innocent \ufb01lm, accuses the narrative of showing political bias towards\nthe Obama administration.

Oh, and\ndid you know that Bigelow is now a\nstrong advocate for torturing and\nabusing military captives? That Bigelow had to go so far as to pen an\nop-ed piece to defend herself and her\nexcellent \ufb01lm is beyond absurd. In\nfact one of the \ufb01lm\u2019s most distressing\nparts is its opening, in which a completely blank, black screen is shown,\nwith a background audio feed of various victims of the 9/11 attack in 2001.\nThis makes bin Laden the number\none target.\nBigelow bravely opens with a series\nof scenes where a prisoner is beaten,\nwater-boarded, humiliated and quite\nliterally treated like a dog. Does this\npromote torture? Of course not. If\nanything, it strongly stands against\nit. Again, if the politicians and pundits had taken the time out of their\nprecious schedules to actually see the\n\ufb01lm, they would realise that. Plus the\nwhole point of the sequence is that\ntorture doesn\u2019t lead to any substan-tial, usable information. Worn down\nand beaten to within an inch of his\nlife, Ammar (Reda Kateb) isn\u2019t quite\ninclined to give up his answers, and\nhis physical and mental deterioration\ndoesn\u2019t exactly help with the process.\nUncomfortable in being a witness\nto such brutal methods but stern\nin her overall approach to the most\nimportant investigation of her life is\nMaya (Chastain), a CIA o\ufb03cer who\nbecomes the \ufb01rst-hand operative in\nhunting down the leader of Al Qaeda\nstarting all the way back in 2003. As\nan initial freshman still coming to\ngrips with active \ufb01eldwork in Pakistan, she isn\u2019t the one in charge im-mediately. But over the years and\nwith thorough observation, she becomes convinced of a single lead that\nshe believes will lead straight back\nto bin Laden and his whereabouts.\nOf course, it sounds too good to be\ntrue, very few people are talking, and\nvery little support is shown from the\nhigher-ups. But she intelligently and\ndiligently marches on, pulling out all\nthe stops, gathering the appropriate\ninformation, interrogating the long\nlist of suspects whilst also running\ninto trouble of her own.\nThe 2005 7/7 London bombings\nand footage from the attack have\nher more frustrated than ever, she\nsurvives the 2008 Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing, she almost gets\ngunned down by angry terrorists who\nhave made her their target, she loses\na close colleague in the 2009 Camp\nChapman attack due to bogus intelligence from an unreliable source,\nbut she perseveres. As the \ufb01lm pro-gresses, as it jumps from one year to\nthe next, you see the impact these\ndead-ends are having on Maya. It is\nobvious to see that she is very much\nalone \u2013 sure she has co-workers, very\ntalented and reliable ones. Jennifer\nEhle excels even in her relatively brief\nrole as the vibrant Jessica genuinely\nconcerned for Maya\u2019s welfare, Jason\nClarke is the un\ufb02inching, rugged Dan\nwho leads a lot of the enhanced inter-rogations, whose techniques Maya\neven learns and employs herself when\ntimes get tough. Dan also develops\ninto something more interesting in\nthe second half of the \ufb01lm, suiting up\nto work in Washington, closer to the\npolitics away from the frontline. But\nultimately we see her isolated, with\nvery little connection, if at all, to the\noutside world, outside her o\ufb03ce, as\nshe spends a decade looking for the\nworld\u2019s most wanted man.\nWith someone like Chastain, who\nhas given so many versatile performances over the last couple of years\nthat one can only look forward to\nwhat comes next for this amazingly\ngifted actress (up next is the Guillermo del Toro-produced horror movie\nMama), the \ufb01lm \ufb01nds itself a strong\nand con\ufb01dent leader, one who doesn\u2019t\nlet anyone undermine her steely con-viction. \u201cI\u2019m the motherfucker that\nfound this place, sir,\u201d she says point-blank to the Director of the CIA, a\ncoldly delivered line. A U.S. Navy\nSEAL Team Leader (Joel Edgerton)\npoints to Maya, and cites \u201cher con\ufb01dence\u201d as the reason why he believes\nthat bin Laden is hiding out in a suburban compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. And by the time you reach the\n\ufb01nale, you will have every bit of faith\nin Maya, with Chastain well deservedly on her way to Oscar glory. \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to smoke everyone involved\nin this op and then I\u2019m going to kill\nOsama bin Laden\u201d is another classic\nline of dialogue that will have you\ncheering her on.\nClosing the \ufb01lm is the 30-min-ute long action footage, seen mostly\nthrough the eyes of the Navy SEALs\nthemselves with their hi-tech visual\nkit, carrying out a relatively stealthy\nassault on the compound. In an operation like this, there cannot be neat,\ntidy camera angles or loud, big-scale\nshootings, which is exactly what is\ndone here, with hardly any use of a\nmusic score, purely relying on what\nis shown on the screen, nothing less,\nnothing more.\nFor a \ufb01lm with an ending we all\nknow well, and a lengthy, wordy process that comes before it, Bigelow has\nmanaged to create an insanely suspenseful piece of work with heightened realism and her focus in all the\nright places. Perhaps adding to the\nfascination and interest is the actual\ndetail of how everything unfolded,\nand the little strands here and there\nthat made all of this possible. So bin\nLaden was killed, but what were the\nactual events that came before that?\nAnd that is where Bigelow\u2019s keen\neye for speci\ufb01c facts becomes handy.\nZero Dark Thirty is as much about\nbin Laden as it is about Maya, and the\nplot revolves around the one woman\u2019s\nquest to bring down the villain. It\u2019s\nabout the e\ufb00ect this manhunt has on\nher, her moral compass, her world,\nand her relentless passion for doing\nwhat she deems right. As for the negative attacks, one can only hope they\nwork as free publicity for the \ufb01lm in\ngeneral.\nZero Dark Thirty\nDirector: Kathryn Bigelow\nScreenwriter: Mark Boal\nStarring: Jessica Chastain, Jason\nClarke, Jennifer Ehle, Kyle Chandler,\nMark Strong, Joel Edgerton\nBin Laden? Bitch, please...\n\n"

    "content": "Our pick of 2013\nMaciej Matuszewski recommends five great upcoming SF books\nI don\u2019t read much modern literary \ufb01ction so Jos\u00e9 Saramago\u2019s Blindness is\nnot something that I would usually\npick up. I am, however, always looking\nto expand my horizons and so, having\nheard good things about the book, I\ndecided to give it a go.\nSet at an unspeci\ufb01ed time in an\nunspeci\ufb01ed country the novel begins\nwith an outbreak of a mysterious illness that makes its victims blind.\nThanks to a health minister more incompetent than Andrew Lansley and\nJeremy Hunt combined the blindness\nsoon spreads throughout the country\n\u2013 plunging it into chaos.\nThe novel, however, does not focus\non the large-scale consequences of\nthis disaster, instead choosing to stick\nwith a small group of people. We see\nthem deal with their initial shock and\nconfusion and try to adapt to the almost insurmountable obstacles that\nthey face, only to witness the fabric\nof society to begin to collapse around\nthem.\nThe confusion inherent in universal blindness is brilliantly expressed\nby the style of the novel itself. Most\nnoticeable is the lack of any speech\nmarks \u2013 with dialogue being integrated with the rest of the text. The reader\nis forced to concentrate to distinguish\nbetween speakers, or even between\ndialogue and narration.\nFurthermore, none of the characters\nare given names, instead being referred to by descriptions like \u201cthe doctor\u201d or \u201cthe \ufb01rst blind man\u201d. This helps\nto add to the universal and timeless\nfeel of the novel. Blindness presents a\nvivid portrait of both how important\nour sense of sight is and how easily we\ncan begin to lose our humanity when\nfaced with an impossible crisis.\nIn the kingdom of the blind...\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\n30\nDead Ever After\nCharlaine Harris\nReleased May 7\nThe \ufb01nal novel of the Sookie Stackhouse \ufb01nally hits the shelves. While\nthe series could never claim to be\nintellectually satisfying it has always\nbeen good fun as a guilty pleasure and\nthis book looks set to be a \ufb01tting con-clusion. With the sixth season of True\nBlood, the hit TV show based on the\nseries, set to begin in June this is the\nperfect opportunity to catch up with\nthe books that started it all.\nThe Unreal and the Real\nUrsula K. Le Guin\nReleased January 3\nThere are few SF authors who could\nclaim to be most in\ufb02uential than\nUrsula Le Guin. Including both\nacknowledged classics, like the award\nwinning The Ones Who Walk Away\nfrom Omelas as well as less known\nworks, this two volume set is great for\nboth fans and Le Guin novices. Each\nstory beautifully displays Le Guin\u2019s\nskills, both in characterisation and\nplotting as well as in writing style.\nThe Republic of Thieves\nScott Lynch\nReleased July 13\nThe long awaited third novel in Lynch\u2019s\nGentleman Bastard series. Lynch is\nrightfully acclaimed for having created\nan intricate and unique fantastical setting heavily in\ufb02uences by Renaissance\nItaly. While the previous novel was let\ndown by poor characterisation it was\nstill one of the best 2007 fantasies. The\nperfect opportunity to get your epic\nfantasy \ufb01x \u2013 at least until the latest\nPatrick Rothfuss novel is released.\nThe Human Division\nJohn Scalzi\nReleased May 14\nAcclaimed author and Science Fiction\nWriters of America President John\nScalzi returns to his Old Man\u2019s War\nuniverse with an experimental \u2018episodic\u2019 novel. Each chapter is partially\nstand-alone and will be released individually in the months prior to the\nfull book\u2019s release date. Having been\nfavourably compared to the works of\nRichard Heinlein and John Campbell\nthis is certainly worth checking out.\nThe Ocean at the End of the Lane\nNeil Gaiman\nReleased June 18\nAfter eight long years genre favourite\nNeil Gaiman is \ufb01nally set to return to\nadult \ufb01ction with The Ocean at the\nEnd of the Lane. Gaiman has been\nrelatively quiet about this book but, as\nwith his previous work, you should expect a well written and deeply atmospheric gothic tale. Gaiman has won\nmore awards than I have space to list\nand, in my opinion, has never written\na bad novel so this book is a must.\nMaciej Matuszewski Books Editor\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n33\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\nA Doomy Night With Katatonia and Alcest\nFollowing the release of their sumptuous ninth album, Dead End Kings, the\nSwedish doom metal quintet Katatonia\nreturned to London, for another evening of great music and melancholia.\nThis time they were accompanied by\nthe French shoe-gazing concept band\nAlcest and an American rock band,\ncalled Junius. As a fan of both Katatonia and Alcest my expectations for this\nshow were high and, of course, I de\ufb01nitely was not disappointed.\nI was rather impressed by Junius;\ntheir sound was intellectual, emotional\nand as described by Rolling Stone as\n\u201ca perfect hybrid of Neurosis and The\nSmiths.\u201d What could be a more appropriate choice to set the dispirited\ntone of the evening? Their music had\npower and was easy to listen to, but\nI felt their songs lacked variety; each\none remaining too faithful to the same\n\u2018slow and bleak\u2019 formula. Having said\nthis, I thought that \u2018Betray The Grave\u2019\nwas a great song (and it has a stunning\nmusic video). Unfortunately, Joseph\nMartinez\u2019s vocals lacked clarity as they\nwere being overwhelmed by the guitars\nand drums (a problem also experienced\nlater by Alcest).\nNext up were the dreamy Frenchmen.\nAlcest never fail to create an atmosphere of pure calmness and tranquillity,\nwhich could be felt as soon as they started playing the enchanting song \u2018Autre\nTemps\u2019\n. I was disappointed at how short\ntheir set was, but at least this was made\nup for by the setlist, which was mainly\ncomposed of songs from their most\nrecent album Les Voyages De L\u2019\u00c2me.\nThis glorious masterpiece, released\nin January 2012, is the most concept\nabiding-o\ufb00ering out of all their albums;\nportraying the \u2018fairy land\u2019 of the warped\nchildhood memories of vocalist, Neige.\nI am delighted to discover that not only\nare Alcest working on their fourth al-Jemma Pilcher Writer\nbum, but this will feature the stunning\nvoice of Billie Lindahl, of Swedish band\nPromise And The Monster, who I also\nhighly recommend.\nFinally, Katatonia took to the stage,\nopening with \u2018The Parting\u2019 from Dead\nEnd Kings. This chilling song was perfectly complemented by the icy-white\nbackdrop, adorned with \ufb02ocks of black\nbirds taken from the album artwork. I\nwas surprised at how many songs from\nthis new album they played, yet from\nwhat I could tell, that was a great deci-sion, as it seemed to be well-received by\nthe crowd. Along with their new work,\nthey performed a varied selection from\ntheir back catalogue. And, of course, no\nKatatonia set would be complete without those predictable classics \u2018My Twin\u2019\nand \u2018July\u2019\n. For me, the highlight of the\nsetlist was \u2018Omerta\u2019 from Viva Emptiness. This song is made beautiful by its\nsimplicity, but the lyrics are weighted by\na sense of foreboding darkness, as the\nomerta has been broken. The song suddenly ends to depict an untimely death.\nJonas Renkse\u2019s voice sounded as\nstrong and clear live as it does on re-cord, which is impressive considering\nthat he has su\ufb00ered from severe vocal\nissues in the past. The music was tight\nand it\u2019s always great to see guitarists,\nAnders Nystr\u00f6m and Per Eriksson, running around manically. Unfortunately,\nJonas was not blessed with charisma. I\nwould love to see him interacting with\nthe audience more, instead of shyly hiding behind his limp, black hair.\nIt seems like a rare experience to\nenjoy the entire line-up of a gig; I\u2019ve\nbecome so used to being subjected to\nterrible support acts. From start to \ufb01nish, however, this show was incredible.\nIt was such a privilege to witness three\ngreat bands, who have the ability to\nmove an audience with their beautiful\nmusic. And now I\u2019m very intrigued and\nexcited to see what they do next!\nFear in a Handful of Dust\nRiaz Agahi reviews Hacker Farm\u2019s new album, UHF\nhere is a scene in Fitzgerald\u2019s novel The Great\nGatsby, where he describes a valley of ashes,\na wasteland in suburban New York, full of dirt, decay,\nash, and poverty. If such a place\nhad a soundtrack, it would probably be Hacker Farm. Such is the\nintimidating, disconcerting nature\nof the soundscapes of this year\u2019s al-bum, UHF. Perhaps as a result of\nthis comparison, I can\u2019t help but feel\nthat there is something very modernist about the atmosphere their\nmusic creates. Their sound is a mix\nof the very darkest elements of electronica (see the broken down beat of\n\u2018Grinch\u2019), noise and maybe a dash of\nindustrial. Unlike the valley of ashes,\nthis dystopian mix provides the cultural backdrop of modern Britain,\nself-styled \u2018Broken Music for a Broken Britain\u2019. \u2018One, Six, Nein\u2019 is one\nexample, with an almost punk-like\ndissatisfaction with society re\ufb02ected\nin a sample. Unlike some punk and\nmany other merchants of a dystopian\nsound, this leads them to new and\ninventive ideas of music production.\nWhile some may say there\u2019s no\nsuch thing as an original idea, it appears to me that Hacker Farm are\ndoing something truly revolutionary.\nThe Hacker Farm collective operates\nout of a farm near Yeovil, but as alluded to before, doesn\u2019t quite offer the serenity some associate with\ncountry life, but rather the poverty\nand dissatisfaction that brews there.\nMy personal highlights include the\naforementioned moments, along\nwith a most depraved bassline on\n\u2018Konrad\u2019 and the foreboding rumble that slowly builds up in \u2018Engine\nRoom\u2019.\nTheir musical ideals revolve\naround stepping away from the modern world of computer production\nand laptop sets to create something\ntruly cutting edge. They attempt to\nreturn music to the physical world,\nwhich is demonstrated by, for exam-ple, giving out Rubick\u2019s cubes which,\nwhen solved, reveal a QR code leading to downloadable content. This\napproach extends to their music,\nwhere the sounds are made from\nlargely discarded materials, such as\nhousing speakers in a variety of unusual places, from a bird-house to a\nmilk churn, giving them a range of\nfrequencies. In a way, it\u2019s like a more\nfully realised Holy Fuck, but they truly stand for something.\nBehind the dystopian disgust, there\nis a very real and positive message to\nreuse and recycle rather than simply\nreplacing. Their music serves as a\nwarning to the consumerist society\nwe currently live in. While the mainstream of music focuses on creating more disposable, arti\ufb01cial, more\nslickly produced and unimaginative\nhits, it\u2019s nice to know that Hacker\nFarm\u2019s latest e\ufb00ort, along with perhaps Prinzhorn Dance School\u2019s\nClay Class, may be one of the few albums which truly give future generations a look into the despair, uncertainty and turmoil of Britain during\nthe recession. Hacker Farm seem to\ntake it a step further though, o\ufb00ering\na directive to their listeners. Since\nthis is a truly excellent sonic assault\non society\u2019s bloated commercialism,\nusing equipment most of the target\naudience view as rubbish, it\u2019s hard to\nreally argue with them.\nT\n\n"

The celebrations\nbuild up to Saturday 9th Feburary\nwhere the 11th annual International\nNight will take place. With performances varying from traditional\ndances to traditional plays adapted\nto original modern day themes; this\npromise to be a hugely entertaining\nevening.\nHere we answer some questions and\nhear from the societies taking part\nand their plans to overload your senses with a cultural explosion that will\nleave you oozing happiness and truly\nin awe of the wealth of culture around\nday in day out at Imperial College.\nWhat is I Night?\nI-Night is a colourful variety show that\nhas been running for over a decade.\nOriginally a haven for international\nstudents to express their various tra-ditions, it has grown into a major\nevent in Imperial\u2019s calendar and is the\nlargest of its kind at the College. The\nevent takes place in the Great Hall of\nImperial College (9 February) and has\nproved to be a successful channel for\nthe cultural vibrancy within the College time and time again. Favourite\nperformances are the Japanese society\u2019s \u2018anime-style\u2019 pantomime and\nCypriot society\u2019s cultural dance and\ncomedic sketches. Unsurprisingly, the\nlaughter and harmonious atmosphere\nproduced by I Night has invited participating groups beyond the overseas\nsocieties including Funkology, Belly\nDancing society and Wushu to get involved in the celebrations.\nI Night is a tradition between all\nparticipating societies and spurs a\nfriendly air of competition encouraging everyone to give their all. As a re-sult, the energy given o\ufb00 by the night\nattracts over 500 students each year\nto attend the event. We are proud to\nunite all of the students of Imperial\ntogether and donate the proceeds to\nour chosen charity. \u2013 Wasim Khouri\nOSC Chair\nWe now hear from IC Belly Dancing, Cypriot society, Hellenic society,\nJapanese society and IC Funkology\nabout what they have in store for us\non the night as well as words from\nthe Co-Chairs of this great event.\nIC Belly Dancing\nThe IC Belly Dancing society would\nlike to present to you a medley of\nchoreographs ranging from classical\nbelly dance to a more modern twist.\nDance is our way of expressing the old\noriental culture and this year\u2019s chore-ographies are an expansion upon last\nyear\u2019s repertoire at I Night: we aim to\nimpress the audience with the shear\nvariety that belly dancing has to offer and can\u2019t wait to see you there!! \u2013\nLydia Lilis\nHellenic Society\nThe Hellenic Society brings to you\nan amazing spectacle right from the\nheart of Greek culture.

Taught from one person to an-other, it cannot be captured in books\nor mastered through studying. With\neach person dancing each dance, the\nunbreakable chain of teachers and\nstudents expands in time to link all\nthose who have danced and have carried it with them over the centuries.\nThese dances bear tales of strength\nand bravery but also of love and pain.\nWe will embody these dances and\nbring the tales back to life for I Night\n\u2013 Michael Dinalexis\nFunkology Society\nFuNkoLoGy began in 2003 as a simple\noutlet for a group of students at Imperial College to train and develop their\npassion for urban dance and push the\nboundaries of hip-hop dance performance across the UK university com-munity.

    "content": "NEWS\n4 FRIDAY 25 JANUARY\nStudent makes racism complaint to College\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe paradox of Paragon: Imperial\nstudents pay more for the same halls\nStage 3 of the Complaints Procedure.\u201d\nDue to the di\ufb00erences between com-plaints, it is sometimes unclear in the\nCollege Ordinances (the documents\nthat govern how College must be run)\nexactly what stage the complaint is at.\nIt seems as though the complaint has\nnot reached Stage 3, the \ufb01nal stage, yet.\nThe student noted that Terry Branch\nand the o\ufb03cers who stopped him behaved very professionally.\nIn the letter to College the student\nhighlighted the reason for being upset.\n\u201cI \ufb01nd it incredibly stressing, especially\nat this point in the term, that I can invest loads into a University and have\nfolks think I do not belong, especially\nwhen I am using a public space for\nUniversity students!\u201d.\nThe incident started with the student\ngoing about their normal routine. In\nthe letter to College this is explained\nas \u201cI entered the Alexander Flemming\nbuilding and brie\ufb02y stepped into the\nmedic\u2019s student union to heat up my\nfood as I have done daily for the term.\nImperial College London students\nare paying more for the same room\nin the same halls than students from\ntwo other London universities. Freshers from Imperial pay \u00a3155 per week\nfor a room in Paragon. Students from\nWest Thames College London (West\nThames) and University of West London (UWL) both pay \u00a3133.55 a week.\nWhen questioned, College gave multiple reasons to Felix to explain the dis-crepancy.\nThe students from the two other\nuniversities have a 44 week contract,\nwhereas the Imperial students have a 39\nweek contract. This means that overall\nImperial students pay a total of \u00a36045,\nwhich is \u00a3168.80 over the total paid by\nthe other students. However, at the 39\nweek mark the Imperial student has\npaid \u00a3836.55 more than the students\nfrom West Thames and UWL. The \ufb01gures were shown to Felix after a Union\nemployee looked into the matter.\nFelix contacted Paul Noke, Head of\nResidential Services and GradPad, to\nexplain the discrepancy in cost. He said\nthat \u201cCollege is, in fact, subsidising to\nbring the weekly rent in at \u00a3155 per\nweek for our students\u201d\n.\nNoke told Felix that there were many\nreasons for the price being as it is.\nHe stated that they had to \u201cnegotiate\nquickly\u201d with providers due to the decision by College to refurbish and redevelop Wilson House being \u201cfairly late\u201d;\na refurbishement that left hall seniors,\nsub wardens and wardens in limbo as\nto their living arrangements. Noke said\nthat the decision by College \u201cdidn\u2019t\nleave us with very much time to get an\nalternative option online ready for the\nUG accommodation application process early last summer\u201d\n. He also noted\nfurther delays saying :\u201cWe looked at a\nnumber of sites and our preferred option was actually in Elephant & Castle\n(in zone 1, not too far from Xenia in\nWaterloo) which would have allowed\nus to keep all of our students under one\nroof with one Wardening team (and\npossibly some of our own sta\ufb00) at more\na\ufb00ordable rents.\u201d The option was dismissed as a number of those in College\nand the Union were uncomfortable\nwith Imperial freshers being located in\nElephant & Castle.\nNoke stated that the length of the\ncontract that College wanted (39 rather\nthan 44 weeks) was a contributing factor to the increased rent saying \u201cthe\nCollege had to pay a slightly higher rate\nto secure the rooms for Imperial College students.\u201d\nWardening increased the cost but\nwas considered \u201cvitally important to\nthe welfare of our students\u201d\n. The team\u2019s\ncosts were initially thought to have\nbeen from the welfare budget, however\nthis was denied by Noke saying \u201cthe\ncosts... are not being covered by the\nwelfare budget this year\u201d\n.\nNoke added that the College also\n\u201cpay a small contribution to allow our\nstudents access to the UWL shuttle\nbusses between 7am\u20138pm each weekday\u201d\n. This is to South Ealing, on the Picadilly line in Zone 2 and is for students\nto travel in to College.\nParagon is a temporary halls that\nis being used by Imperial this year to\nhouse some freshers, it has also been\nused to house freshers before \u2013 an example of this is in 2008 when the College was oversubscribed. Noke said\nthat the decision to house students\nthere was because \u201cthe facilities and\nservices had been \u2018tried and tested\u2019\u201d\n. It is\nin Brentford, which is a long way from\nthe main South Kensington campus.\nThere are 839 rooms in Paragon, which\nis owned and managed by Notting Hill\nHousing Trust. There is an agreement\nwith UWL, which means that they\nmust give their blessing for rooms to be\nreleased to other parties, such as Imperial. West Thames College have a longstanding agreement to use some of the\nrooms for exactly the same terms and\nrates as UWL.\nWilson House redevelopment was\ngranted planning permission on 6 November 2012, and Noke told Felix that\nthey will re-open it for the 2013-14 in-take.\nA black student has raised a complaint\nof racism after being asked to show\nidenti\ufb01cation by security o\ufb03cers following a call made to College by a\nmember of sta\ufb00 who thought the student may not be a member of Imperial.\nThe complaint was raised near the\nend of last term, and to Felix\u2019s knowledge the student has not received a reply to the letter he send via email \u2013 it\nis now over 6 weeks since the original\ncomplaint was raised. The student\nsaid: \u201cIt has now been over a month\nand I have not heard from anyone.\nClearly this matter is not being taken\nseriously.\u201d\nThe student was asked to show identi\ufb01cation, and believes that the reason\nthat they were picked out as not belonging to the university was due to\ntheir skin colour.\nFelix contacted Terry Branch, Head\nof Security, who gave the following\nstatement: \u201cGiven how accessible parts\nof the Campus are to members of the\npublic, the Security team routinely ask\nto check sta\ufb00 and students\u2019 College ID\ncards in restricted areas as part of their\nduties. On this occasion, security o\ufb03cers responded to a call from a member\nof sta\ufb00 who had seen someone she\ndidn\u2019t recognise in her building. The\nsta\ufb00 member was on alert for people\nshe didn\u2019t know following a number\nof thefts in the building recently. As is\nroutine following a call like this, security attended, checked the individual\u2019s\nID card and apologised for any inconvenience caused. The complaints procedure isn\u2019t managed by our team so I\ncan\u2019t advise on this.\u201d\nFelix also contacted Denis Wright,\nDean of Students, who con\ufb01rmed that\nhe was aware of the complaint. He\nsaid: \u201cSecurity have discussed this with\n[the student]. If the student has made a\nformal complaint and it is not resolved\nat the initial stages it will come to me to\nconsider together with the Academic at\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nLizzy Griffiths\nI noticed, however the room was being set up for interviews, so I was\nmore prompt than usual in using the\nmicrowave and ate outside the medic\u2019s\nunion in the common cafeteria since\nthe medic\u2019s union was soon to be oc-cupied. After having my lunch I reentered my home department\u2019s lounge\n(Skempton building) waiting for my\nafternoon lectures to begin.\u201d At this\npoint the student was stopped by two\nO\ufb03cers and asked to show identi\ufb01cation. At the time the student was with a\ngroup of peers who were all white and\nEuropean. In the letter, the student\nsaid: \u201cI even considered the way I was\ndressed and concluded it did not draw\nunnecessary attention to me\u201d.\nIn the letter, the student also expressed dismay at how di\ufb03cult the\nprocedures in place were, saying: \u201cI feel\nit is unfair Imperial College of London\nwith all of its accolades require that I\nsee multiple personnel, set up number\nof appointments and wait an undetermined amount of time for someone\nwho might be able to a\ufb00ect change see\nme. As I write this, I am missing lectures because of the message our policy\nsends not only to me, but to my peers\nand anyone who may be randomly vis-iting: if you do not look like us, you are\nsubject to harassment. I do not know\nhow many others in our community\nhave been negatively impacted by our\npolicy.\u201d The letter \ufb01nished with: \u201cSuch\nnegative impact may lead to Alumni\nnot wanting to donate or volunteer\nwith Imperial at all after their time is\ndone. I urge you to consider making a\nchange. I have not o\ufb00ered a solution,\nbut have only stated the problem. My\njob as a student is to be a student. I\nbelieve the solution should come from\nSta\ufb00 and Administration.\u201d\nThe student did not wish to be named.\nHowever, they asked for a note at the\nend saying that if anyone has been affected by a similar issue contact Felix\n(felix@imperial.ac.uk) to be put in\ntouch.\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\n32\nhe aptly titled album \u00a1Dos!\nis the second instalment\nin the rapid-\ufb01re trilogy\nthat Green Day now has\nreleased. This album is\na bit less clean than \u00a1Uno!, playing to\na garage rock style vibe. Armstrong\nwent as far to describe this as a second Foxboro Hot Tubs album. If you\nhave heard of the Foxboro Hot Tubs,\nthen you will know that they have a\nraw musical style, which can be quite\neasily applied to \u00a1Dos! as well. In fact\none of the songs \u2018F*** Time\u2019 is actually\noriginally a Foxboro Hot Tubs song.\n\u00a1Dos! was released roughly a month\nafter \u00a1Uno!, and one can clearly see\na link between the two. A fast paced\nstyle, with strong power-chords and\na lack of ballads are common traits to\nboth albums. One can best describe\n\u00a1Dos! by being the music when you are\nin full \ufb02ow of the party, while \u00a1Uno!\nprepared you for the party. Thus it has\na bit more bite than before. Another\nAMS album of the week\nHow many bands can say they have their\nown posh burger named after them?\nDutch Uncles can, at least. The Godboy\nBurger Flexxin Out In The Wilds Of The\nNorthern Quarter was created to honour the release of their third album, Out\nof Touch in the Wild. It\u2019s a wonderfully\nconstructed album, albeit short, as I found\nmyself disappointed it had ended so early.\nI really enjoy how Dutch Uncles manage to\ntake their eclectic influences and formulate them in such an unpretentious, easy to\nlisten to way. There\u2019s none of those dodgy interludes, nor those rubbish slow\nsongs you always skip. It\u2019s a treat for the ears, with a lot of interesting percussion such as xylophones, vibraphones and marimbas adding to the jangly\npop vibe.\n\u2018Pondage\u2019 starts as a slow piano ballad-esque piece, until the familiar rhythmic guitars kick in. Almost as soon as it comes, though, the song finishes. I\nnever had Dutch Uncles down as being such teases! In comes \u2018Bellio\u2019, an initial favourite of mine on first listen. Some of the more heavy synth usage can\nbe heard on this song, with a driven grumbly rhythm section to compliment.\nThe album\u2019s first single, \u2018Fester\u2019, was released in November, with an absolutely wonderful video made by director and photographer Isaac Eastgate,\nwho has also produced excellent videos for Django Django and Egyptian\nHip Hop. I urge you to check them all out as they\u2019re some of the best videos\nI\u2019ve seen in ages.\nOut of Touch in the Wild is upbeat, and a real pleasure to listen to. Odd time\nsignatures reminiscent of progressive rock still remain, with \u2018Threads\u2019 sounding heavily influenced by the likes of King Crimson and Japan.\nAs far as the aesthetic of the album, something I particularly enjoyed was\nthe intriguing song names. All a bit weird and only one, two, three syllables\nlong, but they reflect the unity and flow of the album as a whole.\n\u00a1Dos! \u00a1Uno! \u00a1Tres!\nMax Eggl reviews the second installment from Green Day\ncontrast between this album and the\nother two of the trilogy, is the fact that\n\u00a1Dos! has 13 songs on it, instead of 12.\nThis last song to be added is a stunning song in homage to Amy Winehouse, which I will discuss later.\nThe only single released from this\nalbum was \u2018Stray Heart\u2019. A great song,\nwhich lives o\ufb00 the great bass and addictive lyrics, to say it simply, it\u2019s a\ngreat piece of music. Sadly, Armstrong\u2019s trip to rehab due to substance\nabuse cut short any kind of promotional tours or opportunities to bring\nthis single as well as the album to as\nmany ears as possible. This may explain the relative sparse airplay this\nsong has received.\nJust like the previous article on\n\u00a1Uno!, I will be dissecting the songs\nthat I feel that really de\ufb01ne this album\nand give it its character. The \ufb01rst song\nthat really struck me when I \ufb01rst listened to the album was \u2018Lazy Bones\u2019.\nIt starts o\ufb00 in a manner not usually\nassociated with Green Day, in fact the\nsong is not like their style. They own\nthe song though. The chords power\nthrough you, and the lyrics \u201cI\u2019m too\ntired to be bored. I\u2019m too bored to be\ntired\u201d and strangely (as well as sadly)\nseem to apply to my life. The whole\nsong is piercing and was my favourite\nsong for quite a while. The next song\nthat really seemed to talk to me was\n\u2018Nightlife\u2019. It features Lady Cobra of\nthe band Mystic Knights of the Cobra. Among all the high-powered\nguitar chord based tracks of the other\npieces on the album, this song really\ndoes stand out. Musically, it\u2019s slower,\nwith a James Bond-esque bass line/\nguitar ri\ufb00 throughout the song, Lady\nCobra raps parts of her lyrics making\nfor an intriguing musical mix as well\nas Armstrong\u2019s vocals sounding as\nif they came through a faulty micro-phone, which adds to the aura of the\npiece. This combination makes for a\nvery interesting song, which makes\nlistening to it a pleasure.\nHowever the theme of the song is\nalso totally di\ufb00erent from the album,\nif not the whole trilogy. The lyrics\nare peppered with words like \u201cdevil\u201d,\n\u201cblood\u201d and \u201cangel of death\u201d. This really gives the impression of the character of Lady Cobra being \u201cevil\u201d, and\nArmstrong\u2019s a hapless drunk. The song\nis much more heavy-hearted compared to\nthe usual Green Day\nfare. In fact the vibe is\nso dark, that it a\ufb00ects\nthe whole album, giving it a darker tinge\nthan \u00a1Uno! or \u00a1Tre!.\nThe last song on \u00a1Dos!\nthat I would like to talk\nabout is \u2018Amy\u2019. As mentioned before, it is an\nhomage to Amy Winehouse, who passed\naway in 2011. It is the\nmost emotional and\nsincere song of the whole trilogy. A\nsimple chord progression, that would\nsound amazing unplugged, as well as\nreally heartfelt lyrics make this song\nan absolute masterpiece. It ends the\ntrilogy on a sad note, and yet I could\nnot imagine a better way to end \u00a1Dos!.\nPlease look up the song on YouTube or\nsomething, as I promise you it really\nwill be worth your while.\n\u00a1Dos! may be a garage rock album,\nyet the addition of Nightlife and Amy\nadd a little something special, and it\nis this special touch that makes this\nalbum worth listening to. Even without those two, the other songs also\n\ufb02ow nicely into each other, and would\nmake an good album on their own, if\na bit repetitive. If the album would be\nonly songs of that calibre, it would be a\nabsolutely stunning album worth 5/5.\nHowever I found on the whole \u00a1Uno!\nto be stronger and more enjoyable to\nlisten to, while \u00a1Dos! is a bit weak on\nsome songs. Thus I give this album\na 4/5. Like in my last article, I would\nencourage any Green Day fan (in fact,\neven if you are a music fan) to buy this\nalbum, as there is enough good material on it to make it worth your while.\nUTR:HelmandTropaMacaca\nPromoters and record label Upset\nThe Rhythm have really been having\na good run so far this year, throwing the phenomenal Pete Swanson\n(of Yellow Swans) and Mark Fell (of\nSND) event last Monday, and last\nnight putting on a small show in The\nSebright Arms for hot-topic Helm\n(on the hot-topic label PAN, which I\nonly recently realised is the same label that put out Sewer Election\u2019s fantastic Vid\u00f6ppna S\u00e5r in 2010) and the\nobscure Portuguese synth and guitar\nduo Tropa Macaca.\nThis was the \ufb01rst time I had ventured to Bethnal Green, and I must\nsay, The Sebright Arms seems to be a\npretty cool venue. The large upstairs\nis sadly full of standard East London hipster types, but after winding\nthrough some small staircases and\ntight corridors you come to a tiny\ndingy basement with a barely raised\nstage; just the way I like it.\nHelm, whose fantastic 2012 album\nImpossible Symmetry was a highlight of the year, opened proceedings\nwith his inde\ufb01nable noise-ambient-drone crossover sounds. That\u2019s about\nas much of a pigeon holing as I can\nreally give it as this stu\ufb00 has to be\nheard to be understood. Numerous\nsound sources were pushed through\n(surprisingly few, I thought) pedals\nto produce soundscapes that varied from rhythmic and somewhat\ndanceable to light noise, with crushing drilling sounds that I particularly\nappreciated. This was certainly my\nhighlight of the evening and anyone interested in current experimental music that doesn\u2019t neatly\n\ufb01t in boxes should really make\nan e\ufb00ort to see Helm live (or\nwatch his live boiler room\nset I guess).\nTropa Macaca were massively di\ufb00erent to what I\nhad expected from the one\nincredibly lo-\ufb01 recording I\nhad heard: Ectoplasma, released on Software, the label Oneohtrix Point Never\nRoss Gray Music Editor curates. From my single listen to this\nI was expecting a Roll The Dice style\nset up, with two bo\ufb03ns and a modular synthesizer. Instead we were met\nby a guitarist with a minimal pedalboard alongside a keyboardist with\ntwo keyboards and a fair amount of\npedals. Opinion was split on their\nperformance through our group: I\nfelt it wasn\u2019t quite what I expected\n\u2013 I really would have liked a denser\nsoundscape \u2013 which somewhat reduced my opinion, whilst my \ufb02atmate\nfelt that they managed to successfully\nincorporate a huge range of in\ufb02uences (ranging from Black Dice to free\njazz) to produce an unique sound.\nEither way, it\u2019s clear from the\nfact that opinion was split that\nboth of these artists are strong\nlive performers. I look forward to seeing Helm playing\nlive around his native London and am interested in how\nTropa Macaca\u2019s sound\nwill develop as they get\nolder and more expo-sure.\nYasmin Malik\nDutch Uncles: Out of Touch in the Wild\nT\n\n"

Much, much more.\nne of the most ba\ufb04ing\nthings I\u2019ve come across\nconstantly when talking\nto British people is their\nuse of the word \u201cEuropean\u201d to mean \u201cBeyond The Channel\u201d\n,\nas if sharing strong political, historical,\ngeographical, economic and cultural\nties weren\u2019t enough to make the UK part\nof the continent. Rule Britannia, God\nSave The Queen, and all of that, but isn\u2019t\nit time to put the nostalgia for the 19th\ncentury away in favour of some common sense?\nI get it that you used to be an awesome\nnation. I still hear people boast that the\nBritish Empire covered a quarter of the\nworld, and that you civilised (read: op-pressed) countless people around the\nglobe, despite it being as much of a relic\nas your grandfather\u2019s racism and antisu\ufb00ragists, and equally relevant today.\nIt\u2019s understandable: Britain had a pretty\nsweet gig, calling all the shots for more\nthan a hundred years, and it\u2019s good to be\npart of the winning team; but we can\u2019t\ncling to this faded past while the world\nhas changed. We were all heartbroken\nwhen Europe had to relinquish its status as continent of superpowers to the\nUSA and the USSR, but the truth is that\nit could not and cannot compete with\nthem and it cannot exert the same kind\nof in\ufb02uence \u2013 or, at least, it can\u2019t while\nit stands divided, squabbling amongst\nthemselves.\nI believe in a strong, united European\nstate, a United States of Europe, if you\nwill. Perhaps this is only a dream of\nmine, but I have hopes that it will happen one day. After all, the peoples of\nEurope share far more than most re-alise: the British like to concentrate on\nthe di\ufb00erences, like bidets and funny accents and the ability to see the sun more\nthan three days a year, and yet we have\ncommon cultural experiences that make\nall of us the same. Our governments,\ndespite small local variations, all work\nin the same way; we grew up in similar\nenvironments, going to similar school\nsystems, watching similar TV pro-grams; our calendars are largely identi-cal; the goods we buy and the foods we\neat come from the same tradition. Now\nthat we have the internet, we can be ever\nmore alike. Sure, there will be discrepancies here and there, but people across\nthe continent will be able to strongly relate to one another because we have all\nlive similar sorts of life. And, of course,\nthere is an international political organisation that has kept us together for the\npast half a century.\nAh, the EU: a reviled bunch of corrupt\nbureaucrats busy determining the correct curvature of the banana when they\naren\u2019t taxing and obstructing; or the seed\nof a more just state that will represent\nEurope on the global stage without getting mired in squalid local diatribes, depending on who you ask. It has its \ufb02aws,\nof course, because trying to get governments so stubborn to agree on common\nmeasures can lead to ine\ufb03ciencies and\neven injustices. The British public likes\nto rag on when the EU has problems in\ntrying to manage twenty-seven countries\nworth of economies, obstinate nationalism and partisan politics, and yet it soils\nitself with excitement if the Royal Family\nas much as farts, proving that the noblest\ngoals of the others merit mockery if they\ncomewithe\ufb00ortanddi\ufb03culties,butyour\nnation\u2019s idiosyncrasies are important and\ncherished traditions. Because that\u2019s what\nthe European Union is: a noble goal, the\nideal that people that share so much can\ncooperate to do great things instead of\n\ufb01ghting for crumbs amongst themselves.\nThere was a lot of grumbling when the\nEU got the Nobel Peace Prize, as many\nclaimed that it hadn\u2019t done anything\nto deserve it; you know, as if it hadn\u2019t\nguaranteed the lack of war of more than\n\ufb01fty years. People take it for granted\nnow, but Europe has never enjoyed this\nunity and stability in its history. From\nthe Middle Ages to WWII, being in Europe meant that at some point during\nyour lifetime you could be sent to war\nor that your country would be at war.\nMaybe you\u2019re an Austrian sent to conquer Italy, or you\u2019re a German \ufb01ghting\nfor your religion against the Swedes, or\nyou\u2019re an Englishman trying to prevent\nthe French from conquering Spain, but\nthe longwinded point is that European\nnations fought a lot. It was pretty much\na given that con\ufb02icts would eventually\nerupt over this or that issue: the history\nof the continent is one of near-perpetual\nbattle. Today, it would be unthinkable\nand impossible for any two EU member\nstates to come to arms.\nEconomically speaking, it has created\nprosperity and wealth and it has made\nthe Euro, an experiment that is bringing Europe closer and assuring that we\ngrow together. Like it is possible with all\nexperiments, not everything has gone\nperfectly, but the advantages outweigh\nthe disadvantages, and the negatives are\nreasons to better the system and make\nit more just.\nIt is still more of a supranational organisation with limited power rather\nthan an actual political entity, but things\ncan change. They won\u2019t, however, if\nBritain clings to its outdated and unfeasible Splendid Isolation (Britain and all\nthe other countries. The UK, as bad as it\nis, is not the only obstacle on the way to\nintegration). The notion that a country\nthe size of the UK can still be a superpower or at least not be dependent on\nsomeone else\u2019s power is as prevalent as\nit is wrong: Britain has not been able to\ncompete on the global scale, and will be\nable to do so even less if it abandons its\nonly way to relevance short of becoming the 51st US state. And if you say that\nthe UK aims at being left alone and independent even at the cost of not being\nable to have a say on international mat-ters, then I guess I haven\u2019t learned much\nabout the British.\nMy motive for the United States of\nEurope is one of brotherhood, unity\nand freedom. I want it because it makes\nsense, economically, culturally, histori-cally, but if I can\u2019t convince you, then\nperhaps I can bribe you: if the EU were\none, united country, it would be the\nlargest economy in the world by a vast\nmargin; it would represent more than\n500 million people; it would be able to\nexert more in\ufb02uence than any other and\nit would be able to push international\nagendas, from climate change to social\nequality, that no country on its own\ncould hope to achieve: wouldn\u2019t you\nwant to be a part of that?\nO\nWe\u2019re all the\nsame really.\n\u201c\nAfter all, the\npeoples of\nEurope share\nfar more than\nmost realise\n... we have\ncommon cultural experiences that\nmake all of us\nthe same.\nFollow us @FelixComment\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLike us facebook.com/FelixComment\nWrite for\nComment\n\n"

    "content": "Turning the heat back on?\nShiladitya Ghosh guides you through a novel way to manipulate heat\nA\nRoyal Institution may sell its Mayfair Home\nArianna Sorba Science Writer\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\n18\nresearcher at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT) has,\nthrough his self-devised\ntechnique, managed\nto successfully exercise control over\nheat the same way we enjoy control\nover light through mirrors and lenses\n(most disappointingly falling short\nof developing a giant heat ray, for\nthe time being). This new technique,\nwhich utilises semiconducting alloy\ncrystal nanostructures and similar\nmaterials, manipulates the physical\nseparation between atoms so that\nthey correspond to the wavelengths\nof heat phonons.\nTo elucidate how heat and sound\nphonons are di\ufb00erent, Martin Maldovan, the researcher in question,\ndirects us to consider their associated frequencies: sound phonons are\non the order of kilohertz, while heat\nphonons vibrate in the terahertz fre-quencies. Sounds simple enough.\nIn developing this technique, the\ninitial step was to manipulate the heat\nphonons\u2019 operational frequency so it\nwould be reduced and similar to the\nrange of sound phonons, described\nas \u201chypersonic heat\u201d. For this to be\npossible, germanium nanoparticles\nof a particular range of sizes were integrated with silicon alloys, with the\nresultant crystals having the desired\natomic separation needed for this hypersonic heat. Furthermore, the frequency range was narrowed through\nthe creation of thin \ufb01lms on the edges\nof the material, utilising optical principles to \u2018concentrate\u2019 the frequencies\nof the phonons. Not nearly as simple.\nAs a result, about 40% of the total\n\ufb02ow of heat is not only streamlined to\na range of several hundred gigahertz\n(considerably closer to kilohertz than\nterahertz was!), but also focussed to\ntravel in one general direction, similar to the \ufb02ow of photons in lasers.\nThat is de\ufb01nitely no mean feat!\nWith this end-product, the heat\nphonons can be controlled in a variety of ways using analogs of sound-controlling phononic crystals that\nhave already been developed. Some\npotential important applications\nhighlighted by Maldovan are the\nimprovement of thermoelectric devices (which output electricity from\ntemperature gradients), and the development of thermal \u2018diodes\u2019 which,\ncrucially, \u201ccould be useful in energye\ufb03cient buildings in hot and cold climates\u201d \u2013 now that\u2019s de\ufb01nitely something I\u2019d honestly appreciate and be\nvery grateful for.\nPerhaps the fanciest application he\nmentions is the creation of invisibility\ncloaks for heat: for objects to become\nperfectly undetectable by heat sensors and the like. Honestly though, I\ncan only foresee how something like\nthat can be misused in the future\nfor non-peaceful purposes on international scales. Nonetheless, this is\nmerely the \ufb01rst breakthrough of this\nnature in heat-manipulating materi-als; soon, we may well be channelling\nthe excess heat in the atmosphere\nback out into space to counteract\nglobal warming. Or building that giant heat ray, of course. Just in case\nwe get embroiled in The War of the\nWorlds.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.025902\nThe Royal Institution in Mayfair\nhas been a centre for scientific research and communication for over\ntwo centuries.

    "content": "No vampires or zombies in this one\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n37\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\nJohn Park Film Editor\nLincoln\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\nScreenwriters: Tony Kushner, Doris\nKearns Goodwin (book)\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally\nField, Tommy Lee Jones, David\nStrathairn, Hal Holbrook, Lee Pace,\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt\nIt\u2019s a story we all think we know so\nwell. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th\nPresident of the United States, abolished slavery. Yay, he\u2019s a hero and\nhurrah for Lincoln who remains an\nAmerican icon. But Steven Spielberg\nis here to tell us that it wasn\u2019t a simple\ntask by any means. Passing the 13th\nAmendment in the last few months\nof his Presidency, Lincoln achieved a\nmilestone in American politics banning slavery outright \u2013 that\u2019s the end\nresult. But what came beforehand\nwas a whole heap of ups and downs\nthat threatened its smooth course.\nFor international audiences not familiar with the details and intricacies of the event, Lincoln can seem a\ndaunting, information-heavy movie\nexperience. But here is a \ufb01lm so well\ncrafted, cleverly written and brilliantly acted that it forms as much as\nit entertains. Essentially this is a \ufb01lm\nwhere we see a lot of talking, between\nimportant individuals behind closed\ndoors, but how Spielberg keeps every\nsingle minute of it all so fascinating is\na real wonder.\nOne of the best, most deservingly\nrespected and admitted actors of our\ngeneration, Daniel Day-Lewis, steps\ninto the role of Lincoln. And it\u2019s in\nhis cool, digni\ufb01ed and surprisingly\nwitty interpretation of the character\nthat we are immediately drawn into\nthe drama of his tumultuous months.\nDelicately \ufb01nding the balance between the many di\ufb00erent aspects of\nhis role, his leadership position as\nthe President of his nation, as well\nas the more private, family-oriented\nside as a husband and grieving fa-ther, Day-Lewis once again shows\nthere is virtually no limit as to what\nhe can achieve. His performance is a\ndeeply moving and a\ufb00ecting one, in\nhis tight, rigid, tall frame, with his\nsoft-spoken, eloquent voice, drifting\nfrom one scene to another, always\ngrounded, concentrating in his many\nthoughts, and yet remaining entirely\naccessible to everyone watching him.\nPolitics has never been this exciting or gripping, and courtroom-style\nscenes have never been this overwhelmingly fun to watch. Of course,\nwhen Lincoln proposes this Amendment, there is as much support as\nthere is harsh criticism. Within his\nown Republican Party, Lincoln manages to secure enough support, mostly\nthanks to Francis Preston Blair (Hol-brook), a highly in\ufb02uential member\nwho can guarantee support from the\nconservative Republicans. The catch\nwith Blair is that he\u2019s keen to start the\npeace talks between the Union and\nthe Confederacy, hoping to end the\nCivil War that is destroying America. Peace is never a bad thing, especially when so many lives have been\nlost, but complicating matters is that\nLincoln will no doubt lose a certain\nlevel of support for the Amendment\nshould the War end before it is actually passed. If there is a real chance\nthe War will end without this new\nAmendment passing, a lot of people\nwill just not bother. This puts Lincoln\nin a precarious position of having to\nhold o\ufb00 on the peace talks as long as\npossible, whilst getting a move on\nwith gathering enough votes.\nUnafraid to voice their opposing\nviews is the Democratic Party, led\nby Congressman Fernando Wood\n(Pace) who is vehemently against\nthese changes. End of slavery would\ninevitably lead to racial equality, and\nthis is something even most members in the United States House of\nRepresentatives (all white) aren\u2019t willing to accept. So Lincoln must again\nwalk a \ufb01ne line between pushing his\nanti-slavery agenda whilst keeping it\nclearly separate from further racial\nissues. Another hiccup here \u2013 a vocal\nsupporter for the Amendment, Radical Republican Congressional leader\nThaddeus Stevens (Jones), again quite\nthe in\ufb02uential man in the govern-ment, is a staunch supporter of racial\nequality. If this Amendment has any\nchance of passing, Stevens needs to\nkeep a lid on his enthusiastic views,\nto not lose anyone already on board.\nHaving to win with a majority, it\u2019s\nnot enough just to have the backing\nof his own party. He needs to convince the Democrats, and in order\nto do so he needs to step into the\nrather dirty pool of politics \u2013 quietly\npromising federal jobs to persuadable\nDemocrats for their votes. And so begins some intense lobbying, headed\nby William N. Bilbo (James Spader)\nand his fellow lobbyists Richard\nSchell (Tim Blake Nelson) and Robert\nLatham (John Hawkes). A lot of comedy ensues here, as not all of their attempts are entirely successful. Who\nsays a two-and-a-half-hour-long political drama can\u2019t be funny?\nAnd it\u2019s not just the politics keeping Lincoln busy: his family life is\nalso given its share of meaty running time. His wife, Mary Todd (Sally\nField), often su\ufb00ering from terrible\nmigraines and still reeling from the\nloss of their son, provides support\nalthough she herself sometimes requires some hand-holding of her\nown. More so when their eldest son,\nRobert Todd (Gordon-Levitt), upon\nreturning home from his studies at\nHarvard Law School, announces that\nhe wants to join the \ufb01ght in the Civil\nWar. Abraham respects his grown\nson\u2019s wishes, almost appearing un-interested, whereas Mary Todd, at\nthe thought of losing another one of\nher children, cannot believe her husband\u2019s shockingly relaxed response.\nAlready emotionally unstable, this\npushes Mary over the edge, leading to\na heated argument between the cou-ple, which provides one of the \ufb01lm\u2019s\n\ufb01nest scenes in which these two outstanding actors have at it with their\nbuilt-up \ufb01ery emotions.\nSpielberg reportedly spent almost\ntwelve years in preparation for this\nmovie, and it shows in his meticulous\nstructure and authentic-looking sets,\nas well as the general atmosphere he\nplaces his actors into. Everywhere is\nappropriately dampened down with\nwooden furniture, smoke-\ufb01lled and,\nwhen required, in complete and utter chaos, most notably in the House\nof Representatives, where hot-headed\nindividuals mouth o\ufb00 and start attacking one another. There are plenty\nof elaborate set decorations and designs to marvel at, and the technical\nachievements are extremely vast.\nThere are lots of facts to be relayed\nto the audience \u2013 everything needs to\nultimately make sense, and we must\nunderstand why various characters\nare doing what, with what intentions.\nAnd nothing could be made clearer in\nTony Kushner\u2019s script. It is immediately clear that Lincoln had to go to\ngreat lengths to gain enough support,\nperhaps venturing into places he may\nnot have been most comfortable with.\nHeatedly arguing, smartly bribing,\ncalmly persuading, raising his voice\n(although very rarely), he\u2019s had to do\nit all, and the many fragile complexities that could either make or break\nthe ambitious plan are told to us in a\nvery logical step-by-step manner that\nall the dense material is told compe-tently, whilst not confusing the hell\nout of anyone.\nThen there is the cast \u2013 the phenomenal cast in roles both big and\nsmall who shine in every supporting\npart there is. Sally Field is typically\nstrong, sturdy and feisty, Tommy Lee\nJones has a lot of fun arguing his way\nagainst his opposing party (both actors thoroughly deserving their Best\nSupporting Oscar nominations) and\nLee Pace provides the healthy op-ponent. Another stand-out is David\nStrathairn, as Secretary of State William H. Seward, a loyal friend and\ntrusted advisor to the President, who\nstands by him as Lincoln faces one\nof the toughest, most unpredictable\ntimes of his Presidency.\nWhat an incredible feat Spielberg\nhas accomplished here \u2013 it\u2019s a \ufb01lm\nthat is both intelligent and wholly\ncomprehensible, an utterly enjoyable\nexperience from start to \ufb01nish, based\non the unlikeliest subject matter.\nDon\u2019t like this review?\nWrite your own!\nfilm@imperial.ac.uk\nWhen will top\nhats come back in?\nWhat do you\nmean the Library\nis closed on\nFriday nights?\n\n"

This\nwinter the bitter English weather has\nbeen brutal but this gave the team\ntime to heal up and, in some cases, fatten up. A very strong squad took the\ntwo hour trip to Eastbourne, home of\nsun seeking pensioners and apparently\nBrighton rugby. We travelled through\nrain and snow to be greeted by a pitch\nthat had seen better days.\nKeen to avoid the arctic temperature we ran out for only a quick warm\nup. Although Brighton play in the\nleague below they had beaten table\ntopping St Barts meaning they were\nnot to be underestimated.\nCaptain Jack, returning after injuring his ankle earlier the season, gave\none of his inspiring team talks punctuated with blood curdling screams\nof \u2018This is Sparta\u2019.\nGeorge Lane kicked o\ufb00 the game\nand the team got o\ufb00 to a great start\nwith strong tackling leading to a\npenalty. This dominance continued\nfor the next four minutes where we\nsaw the \ufb01rst yellow of the game. Toby\nSpittle\u2019s jovial behaviour around the\nbreakdown landed him with a well\ndeserved, albeit poor, headbutt, giving the Brighton loose head a much\nneeded 10 minute breather. His\nclaims of vengeance left Toby quaking in his boots. The resulting penalty left Imperial with a line out on\nthe opposition 22. A well executed\nline out lead to an unstoppable maul,\nwhere the pack jogged to the line\nleaving Michael \u2018Maurice\u2019 O\u2019Connell\nan easy \ufb01nish. George Lane converted from the touch line to make it\n7-0. As the temperature dropped we\ncould see the opposition struggling\nand Captain Jack capitalised with a\nstrong ten metre juggernaut through\nthe opposition line. A \ufb02u\ufb00ed conversion left us 12 points clear. Keeping\nup the pressure, Imperial earned a\n5 metre scrum just minutes later,\nand an already tired Jon \u2018Team Talk\u2019\nHardisty picked and popped to man\nof the match Scott Fraser who made a\nslick pass to Nathan \u2018Brucie\u2019 Fitzpatrick leaving him with a simple \ufb01nish.\nAfter a quick kick return, IC again\nfound themselves within touching\ndistance of the Brighton line.\nHowever, after a taste of glory, Nathan got greedy and decided to leach\nonto the back of a rolling maul and\nclaims to have scored the fourth try\nof the match. Another quality strike\nfrom George Lane led to a missed\nconversion leaving the score 22-0 at\nhalf time.\nDespite the domination Imperial\nshowed in the \ufb01rst half, the team\nknew they had to raise their game in\nthe second half in order to deliver the\nperformance they knew they were\ncapable of. Impact subs included\nPierre \u201cGross\u201d L\u2019Bour who replaced\nTom \u201clean mean one-\ufb01fteen\u201d Hansen\nwho had made a slightly above average contribution in the \ufb01rst half. The\nsecond half started with Imperial\nnow playing up-hill, but determined\nto maintain their clean sheet. After\na lengthy exchange of tactical kicks\nfrom both teams, ending with a sliced\nclearance kick from Scotty \u2018Too Hotty\u2019 Fraser, prompting jeers from the\nspectators and resulting in Brighton\nputting much of the pressure on Imperial. After winning a penalty after\na huge defensive performance Imperial found themselves with a line\nout 35m from the opponents try line\nand again the maul was called upon.\nImperial nailed another line out and\nhad the maul going forward; time\nafter time the forwards hit the maul\nforcing the Brighton pack into a fast\nretreat. An awesome surge of power\nfrom Imperial propelled the maul\ninto the 22 and eventually over the\nline for impact sub L\u2019Bour, who was\nalready pumped from the \u201ccafe\u201d from\nhis thermos, to complete a devastating display of dominance from the\nImperial pack to extend the lead to\n27-0.\nBrighton\u2019s kick o\ufb00 preceded another spell of pressure from them.\nAlthough Imperial\u2019s discipline was\nhurting them it was made up by relentless tackling. Eventually a turnover was forced and a box kick from\nScott Fraser was recovered by Brucie\nand again Imperial found themselves\nin Brighton\u2019s half. Imperial applied\npressure and found themselves once\nagain inside the 22 setting J Flan up\nfor a carbon copy of his \ufb01rst try as he\nthrust once again through the Brighton defence. Notable mentions must\nalso go to \u201cmassive\u201d Mike O\u2019Connell\nfor looking like he was mounting a\nhorse and for Big George Lane\u2019s \ufb01rst\never low tackle. A satis\ufb01ed but not\necstatic Imperial left the \ufb01eld happy\nwith the win but knowing improvements need to be made. The major\nachievement was managing to \ufb01nish\nwith a nil score (34-0) against a team\nthat put 2 tries past the Medics...\nBring on Varsity.\nWith the highest number of members in the history of the club, it has\nbeen one of the most successful years\nfor ICSM Badminton in both team\nperformance and social events.

There was a\nlack of consumer interest, save the\nenthusiasts. The phone had great\nhardware, at that time, but it failed to\ncapture the attention of consumers.\nOn the software front, stock or vanilla Android was an ugly mess \u2013 other\nmanufacturers had to slap on their\nown \u201cskins\u201d to bring some kind of\naesthetics to the user interface (UI).\nThe next two iterations were not\nthat great either. The Nexus S and\nthe Galaxy Nexus had pretty standard hardware at their release, and\nweren\u2019t that exciting. Nexus 4 is their\nlatest attempt and it has achieved\nconsiderable success on many fronts,\nwhile failing on several others.\nThe Nexus 4 was designed in collaboration with LG, a manufacturer\nwho is not that well known in the\nAndroid ecosystem, leading at least\ninitially to some scepticism with\nthe device. It featured the top of the\nline hardware at the time of release,\nand even now at the time of writing.\nPhones of early 2013, at least, will\nbe matching the speci\ufb01cations of\nthe Nexus 4. It features a Quad-core\nQualcomm Snapdragon System-onChip along with a generous 2 GB\nof RAM. The phone looks stunning.\nAt just \u00a3279 for an unlocked phone\nbought directly from Google, the\nphone is very competitively priced.\nBut the hardware is also where the\nphone fails, in some ways.\nThere are three ways in which the\nphone\u2019s hardware falls short. Firstly,\nthephonehasanoticeablelackofsup-port for Long-term Evolution (LTE),\nthe 4G technology that is widespread\nin the US and is becoming more\navailable in the UK, and elsewhere.\nGoogle has (in)famously decided to\nexclude LTE support to prevent issues with carrier lock-ins and other\nlicensing shenanigans. Secondly, the\nphone has limited \ufb02ash memory sup-port, coming in at only 8 GB and 16\nGB. Finally, Google has opted to cover the back of the phone with glass.\nWhilst this makes the phone look\ns l e e k ,\nhaving\na glass\nb a c k\nc a n\nlead to\ncracked\nphones.\nW h i l e\nt h e s e\nhardware\ni s s u e s\nmight be\nmere minor\nannoyances\nto some people (and the\nauthor, admit-tedly), there\nexists a larger\nissue: availabil-ity.\nGoogle has had\nsevere issues with\nfuture. This will\nbe nothing, but\nhelpful to grow the\nnumber of Android\nusers, and make more\nmoney for Google.\nThe phone availability\nNexus 4, a real beaut! The Glitter does put me off a bit though\nThe News Bubble\nA phone, a phone, my degree for a phone. Of course if you are still\nreading this box, your phone is very important to you! Well, as you\nnoticed, we have done a pure smartphone-based issue. So the news\nbubble will also be all about one of the fastest tech sectors around!\nSony Xperia Z\nAt CES, Sony showed off the Z. This quite well designed phone also\nhappens to be waterproof. Admittedly this includes plastic coverings\nfor all openings, like charger and earphone plug. However it was still\nvery impressive when the phone was dunked in a fish bowl. However\ndiving with your Z is still not on. Shame!\nBendy Phones\nAlso at CES, Samsung showed off its first prototypes of their bendy\nphones. While Nokia was the first to be linked with this technology,\nSamsung has actually done something. The screens, based on flexible\nOLED tech, are quite impressive. The implications of this are quite\nprofound - I mean, a wearable phone!?!\nCheaper 4G?\nFor all you who read this title, expecting a good deal, I am sorry to\ndisappoint you. EE did announce cheaper contracts for their 4G data\ndeals, but for most of us (i.e. Cash-strapped students) \u00a321 a months,\nsim only for 500mb (which you will blow through before you can\nsay EE) seems a bit much. However this move by EEs is apparently\na preemptive strike against release of the 4G networks of the other\nproviders. Hopefully the added competition in this new area, will lead\nto cheaper prices, and a possibility for even the poorest of us to blaze\nthrough the internet on our phones.\n\u201d\nThe Nexus 4\nis simply a joy\nto use\nJelly Bean\n(Android 4.2)\nis the best\nversion of\nAndroid so far\nsince launch day has been low.

Sure, you could\ngo to Carphone Warehouse or opt\nto purchase the phone on contract,\nbut you would be paying more than\nnecessary. The software front of the\nphone, however, is admittedly pretty\nperfect, in my opinion.\nJelly Bean (Android 4.2), is the best\nversion of Android so far. The UI has\nbeen polished and looks aesthetically\npleasing and modern. This puts\nthe rather dated UI of iOS on\niPhones and iPads to shame.\nI would argue that the stock\nversion of Android is now\nthe best version of Android\nto use. Skins that manufacturers like HTC and\nSamsung slap onto the\nUI now feel extraneous\nand seem to bog down\nthe performance of the\nUI.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editors: Jason Parmar\nMaximilian Eggl\ntechology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nn terms of iOS, 2012 was the\nyear of the iPhone 5. After a\nrather disappointing iPhone\n4S, the anticipation had been\ngrowing under the surface for\na long time. When the iPhone 5 was\nrevealed on the 12th of September\nof last year, it sported a radical new\ndesign, a better graphics processor,\nnew A6 chip as well as LTE technology and \ufb01nally Felix Tech has one to\nreview.\nBefore diving into the heart of the ar-ticle, I would like to \ufb01rst give a negative point, not to the iPhone 5 but\nactually iOS 5 instead. Yes, I know\nthat was almost 2 years ago, but I feel\nI have to get this o\ufb00 my chest. A feature which was not widely announced\nwhen it was revealed, was the fact\nthat you need a sim card to activate\nyour phone. While not actually det-rimental, it was annoying to say the\nleast. Perhaps it is understandable,\nbecause in e\ufb00ect a phone cannot be\nused without a SIM card, however I\nthought the iPhone was supposed to\nbe so much more than a phone. Nevertheless, after a trip to the Apple\nstore to get myself a nano sim (which\nwas less stressful than I thought), I\nhad a perfect working model of the\nlatest version of the iPhone.\nThe actual design of the new phone\nis quite, for lack of a better word,\nbeautiful. Thinner than the iPhone\n4S, it looks like the luxury item it is\nsupposed to be. The black version has\na grey bezel on the back which makes\nit elegant, and I personally feel that\nthe move from steel, that was used\nin the previous two iPhone models,\nto an aluminium composite makes\nthis phone feel more like a piece of\nart than a utility tool. This change is\nexempli\ufb01ed by the sides of the phone,\nwhich are composed of a grey matte\narea as well as two bands of highly\nbu\ufb00ed material, which could almost\nact like mirrors. Apple has also managed to make the iPhone signi\ufb01cantly\nthinner as well as lighter than its pre-decessors, which comes with a bit of\nsurprise, as not only is the iPhone 5\nlarger it also includes the LTE tech.\nThe screen of the iPhone 5 is, to say\nthe least, amazing. Even better than\nthe 4S, which was purported to be the\nbest screen on the market, it is razor\nsharp and the colours are vibrant.\nAlso in line with the general smartphone competition, the iPhone 5 has\na larger screen now. Even though this\nis the \ufb01rst iPhone with a 4\u201d screen, it\njust felt right. In comparison previous\niPhones seem short and ill-\ufb01tting.\nApps which are optimised to utilise the whole area of the screen, are\nbeautiful to behold and really do use\nall those extra pixels. Even apps that\nare built for the smaller screen size do\nnot su\ufb00er any disadvantage, as black\nbars are added to the top and bottom\nof the iPhone 5 screen. In fact, due to\nthis phone being black I did not even\nnotice unless I really concentrated on\nit (although probably on the white\none it would be more noticeable).\nIn terms of processing power and\nactual speed the iPhone 5 kicks ass.\nFaster than any previous iteration of\niPhone, I also pitted it against a Nokia\nLumia 920. Although the Lumia was\nslightly more reactive with certain\nactions, in most of tests I did, the iPhone held its own. The new A6 chip\nreally does feel miles better than the\nA5, and A5X and in the future I will\nbe attempting to max it out as much\nas possible. The graphics processor\nis also amazing, and when playing\nFIFA 13, not only did it play and \ufb02ow\nextremely nicely, the graphics performed admirably.\nCameras and photos are a big part\nof what makes a smart phone, as the\ndigital camera slowly fades into ob-scurity. The iPhone 5 has the same\n8MP camera as the 4S in the back,\nand now has a upgraded 1.2 MP front\ncamera. The back camera was quite\ngood in all lights, being sharp and fo-cused. Also the rather rapid capture\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\n40\nI\nrate impressed me, as the picture was\ntaken almost instantaneously. In addition to that, the new panorama feature is quite impressive, it\u2019s easy to use\nwith great panorama pictures coming\nout as a result. The only thing that\nannoys me is the digital zoom. Apple\ndeclared this was such a good camera,\nand yet when you want to zoom onto\nsomething everything turns blurry.\nSomething that could maybe be improved on with iPhone 5S/6.\nThe operating system of the iPhone\n5 (iOS 6) is Apple\u2019s latest software.\nWhilst not without some \u201cscandal\u201d,\nit is a good OS nonetheless. You have\nprobably heard all about the horrible\nmapping app, so I won\u2019t bore you with\nit. However keep in mind not only\nhave Nokia released Here Maps, but\nthere is now a Google Maps app in\nthe app store which works really well.\nPros of iOS include iMessage, the\ngreat app store and iCloud services.\nHowever the most bene\ufb01cial part\napart about the software is that Apple\nmakes both it and its corresponding\nhardware. This means that the full capabilities of the phone can be utilised.\nThus the OS is fast, responsive and a\npleasure to use.\nOther signi\ufb01cant features on the\niPhone 5 are the new Lightning connector and usage of the nano sim\ncard. Firstly the Lightning connec-tor. Released to mixed reviews, it has\nbeen one of the big talking points of\niPhone 5. It is much smaller than the\nprevious connector, which allowed\nApple to \ufb01t more into the new iPhone\nand still keep it thin and light. Yet it\nalso renders any previous accessory\nuseless. Admittedly for me it was not\nmuch of a deterrent as I do not have\nthat many accessories, however I can\nimagine for someone who did splash\nout on the stereo system, car plugs\netc. that this would be quite annoying.\nApple\u2019s handling of this new technology was unwise to say the least, as\nmany people who would have bought\nthe iPhone 5, hesitated. Perhaps\nthey should have included converters for iPhone buyers. However they\nwouldn\u2019t make that much money that\nway. The nano sim, just like the micro sim was used to make more space\nfor tech. Apparently you can cut your\nmicro sim to nano sim proportions,\nhowever for those of us who do not\nhave such steady \ufb01ngers, a rather annoying wait to use the phone starts.\nThe battery of the iPhone 5, like\nmost other smartphones, is not the\ngreatest. Often not making it past a\nday and a half. However I had not expected much more, so I wasn\u2019t really\ndisappointed. Sadly I cannot comment on the LTE capabilities of the\nphone, as at the time of writing of this\narticle a contract had not yet been ob-tained.\nAll in all this phone is a wonder to\nbehold. Apple have really released a\ngreat phone, combining a beautiful\ndesign, powerful chip, cutting-edge\nscreen and a great OS to create one\nof the best user experiences of the\nmarket. The price may be a bit eye-watering but you will get everything\nthat you paid for.\niPhone 5, review is finally here\nMax Eggl tries his best to give you the low down on the newest Apple phone\ndesign of the\nnew phone is\nquite, for lack\nof a better\nword, beautiful\n\u201c\u201d\nNew Apple EarbudsBetter than expected\nThe lightning\nconnector,\none of the big\ntalking points\nof the iPhone\nThin, light and powerful, just like what the Apple iPhone 5 should be\n\n"

Everyone is extremely\nconcerned, including his boss who pays\nhim a personal visit for a personal\nreprimand. Instead of opening the\nbedroom door to find Gregor, his\nfamily and boss are surprised and\nsubsequently disgusted by the huge\nbeetle-like creature which has replaced him.\nBooks with obvious metaphors\nare sometimes some of the most\ndifficult to interpret, a personal\nopinion extending to Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis. It is always interesting\nto see how such works are translated to the stage and it is great when\nthey contribute to personal understanding of the literary classics.\nWith this in mind I was excited to\nsee a limited run of the \u2018Smash Hit\u2019\nproduction at the Lyric Theatre.\nThe obvious question that anticipated any viewer was how the\nUngeziefer is depicted, and it was\nprobably inevitable that a man in\na huge bug costume clambering\naround on stage would have been a\nbit too tacky. Opting for a salesman\nclambering around on stage slightly\ndetracted from the mystery of what\nhe has transformed into, contributing to the interpretation that he has\nnot physically transformed at all.\nThe music (Nick Cave and Warren\nEllis) was also a definite highlight,\nand was more noticeable compared\nto many other plays. However, this\ncould have merely been a positive\ncompared to the quality of direction\n(David Orr and Gisli Orn Garoarsson) and acting which was embarrassingly pantomime-esque.\nOf course, acting on a stage requires large gestures, exaggerated\nspeech, and audience-directed ac-tion. In this production however\nthe cast\u2019s performance was so intense that it made the play difficult\nto believe or meaningfully identify\nwith in any kind of realistic manner.\nPerhaps this was an attempt to\ncapture the strangeness of Kafka\u2019s\nworld. There was no direct mention\nof any bug or transformation, this\ncould have been a way of reminding\nthe audience of the surreal event\nby distancing the play from reality.\nThis definitely seemed the case as\nthe play opened with unnecessary\nand annoying dramatic poses during the Samsa family\u2019s breakfast at\nthe table.\nHowever, as the play progressed,\nsuch a defence for over-exaggerat-ed acting seemed too far-fetched,\nand if this effect was a purposeful\nby-product, it did not manage to attain its intended effect. It was not\nenjoyable.\nFor certain scenes though, such\nas Grete\u2019s freakout and Gregor\u2019s\ndeath, the comic relief interspersed\nthroughout the darker and more\ndistressing events, was entertain-ing.\nOverall Metamorphosis was well\nproduced. The open plan family\nhouse was a clever way of allowing\nLily Le metamorphoses at the Lyric\nTaking the carapace\nG\nus to see Gregor\u2019s behaviour as his\nfamily grew increasingly ashamed\nand separated from him. The relatively small stage prevented the\noveruse of a single setting becoming boring and negated the need for\nmessy changes between scene.\nMetamorphosis is on at the Lyric\nHammersmith. Tickets from \u00a312.50.\nUntil 9th February.\nGangnam Style and acid day at\nthe office considered a success\n\n"

(Though that could work too... sort of...)\nhe term \u201csocial enterprise\u201d was \ufb01rst coined\nduring the late 70s. The\nidea is simple. A social\nenterprise is a business\nwhere social aims come \ufb01rst, and\npro\ufb01t comes second. Yes, you read\nthat right \u2013 social aim \ufb01rst, pro\ufb01t sec-ond. Social entrepreneurs are business minded people who are a little\nbit warm and fuzzy around the edge.\nThink Alan Sugar meets Mother Theresa, or Donald Trump meets Florence Nightingale. It\u2019s all about business acumen being applied to doing\ngood.\nSocial enterprises have been popping up all over the place since the\nstart of the new millennium. They\nare a growing trend that\u2019s showing no\nsign of slowing, and for good reason.\nSince social enterprises generate their\nown income, and don\u2019t rely on grants\nor donations (like charities do), they\nare often hailed as a more sustainable\nmechanism for social change. This\nmeans that when times get tough (hel-lo \u2018\ufb01nancial crisis\u2019) and charities su\ufb00er\nfrom lowered levels of funding, a social enterprise can retain the ability to\nkeep on solving social issues.\nThere a loads of social enterprises\naround. You probably think of many as\njust normal businesses rather than social projects. Take Jamie Oliver\u2019s restaurant Fifteen, for example. Here, unemployed young people are trained as\nchefs and are thereby given the chance\nto have a better future. Another good\nexample is The Big Issue, where homeless people are given the opportunity\nto take some control of their lives and\nto re-join mainstream society by selling a magazine.\nThere are so many di\ufb00erent kinds\nof social enterprises, set up by di\ufb00erent people for di\ufb00erent reasons. Teach\nFirst, Divine Chocolate and The Good\nGym are three di\ufb00erent examples.\nT\nFRIDAY 25 JANUARY\n8\nTeach First\nEveryone has heard of TeachFirst. They\nhave an innovative business model\nwhere they entice bright graduates to\ntackle educational disadvantage by\nteaching in schools for two years or\nmore. Once they have completed the\nscheme, graduates choose whether to\ncontinue teaching, assume positions\nwithin government or industry or even\nwork on their own social enterprises.\nIt was set up by an ex McKinsey em-ployee. Brett Wigdortz took a planned\nsix-month leave of absence from McKinsey to develop a business plan for\nTeach First. He had no experience of\neither public policy or teaching when\nhe started and had never managed\nanyone. Teach First is a great example\nof how anyone with a great idea, some\nbasic business knowledge and true\ndedication can make a real positive dif-ference.\nThe Good Gym\nA lesser-known social enterprise is the\nGoodGym. Operating in East London,\nthey take exercise out of the gym and\nmake it useful. In their words \u201cgyms\npurposefully waste energy. There are\nmany neglected tasks, and people in\nour communities that need that energy.\u201d For example, in order to tackle\nloneliness amongst older people,\nGoodGym members adopt an elderly\nperson as their coach and run to their\nhouse to deliver a newspaper, or some\nfruit. Pretty neat, huh?\nIt was set up by Ivo Gormley, a\nClore Social Leadership fellow and\ndocumentary \ufb01lm-maker and seems\nas though it\u2019s growing in popularity\nacross the big smoke.\nYour turn?\nSo as you can see, there are loads of\ngreat social enterprises around. But\nwhat about student-run social enter-prises? There are a few initiatives run\nby students, E.quinox is a brilliant\nexample of a student led social enterprise at Imperial. However, shouldn\u2019t\nthere be more? After all universities\nare full of bright, creative people\nwanting to involve themselves in interesting extra curricular projects.\nSocial enterprises should be bursting\nout of the seems of our campuses. So\nwhy aren\u2019t they?\nLast Friday Imperial Hub met up\nwith Year Here (another Social Enterprise challenging gap year students to\nspend a \u201cyear here\u201d in the UK tackling social issues in their own back-yard) to consider this exact question.\nOne interesting point raised was\naround failure. University teaches us\nto fear failure. As students, we are\nconstantly trying to avoid failing our\nexams, lab reports and/or projects.\nHowever, in real life, and especially in\nthe \ufb01eld of entrepreneurship, failure\nis essential to learning, re\ufb01ning and\nthen improving.\nFailure is conducive to good ideas\nand the term \u201cfail fast\u201d is a rapidly\nspreading piece of wisdom for budding entrepreneurs. We talked about\nhow opening up a space where failing\nis OK, and even encouraged, could\nhelp students be more experimen-tal, adventurous and ultimately more\ncreative in their social entrepreneurship initiatives.\nAnother challenge discussed was\nDid anyone else used to think\nthat The Naked Chef was\nabout Jamie cooking naked?\n\n"

It is much more than that as\nit creates memories and brings people\ntogether!\nRemember the smell of your favourite food your mum used to make for\nyou when you were a kid? Or how excited you were about your huge birthday cake? Or the cookies you used to\neat at your friend\u2019s house?

It is\nprobably the only thing that can bring\nmemories back!\nAnd of course, food is more enjoyable when it is shared with other\npeople. So when you cook invite your\nfriends too. Is there a better gift you\ncan give to your friends than cooking for them (except maybe some nice\nFrench liqueur\u2026)? I don\u2019t think so.\nCooking requires e\ufb00ort and that\u2019s why\nI appreciate people who would cook\nIt really is simple, cheap and absolutely divine. It will take you about 10\nminutes to make and it only needs 15\nminutes in the oven. So, in less than\n30 minutes and with minimum e\ufb00ort\nyou can also have this amazing des-sert.\nYou will need 6 ramekins.\nIngredients:\n1 1/2 cups all purpose \ufb02our\n1/3 cup good quality cocoa\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n1/3 cup sun\ufb02ower oil\n1 cup (preferably almond) milk\nSeeds of 1 vanilla pod\n2 tbsp vinegar\n1 tsp baking soda\n1/2 cup chocolate chips\n6 ramekins\nProcedure:\nPreheat your oven at 180 degrees.\nPlace parchment paper in 6 ramekins\nand lightly grease them.\nIn a bowl mix the almond milk, the\noil, the vinegar and the vanilla seeds.\nSet aside and leave for about 15 minutes or until it curdles.\nIn a separate bowl sift the \ufb02our, cocoa\nand soda.

Manchester\nUniversity, academic home of Professor Cox, seems to agree that the science populariser is at least partially\nresponsible, as internal surveying of\ntheir students suggests.\nBy the start of 2012 the application\ncount for physics degrees has had a\n50% increase compared to 8 years ago\nand estimates show that this rise continues even against the backdrop of\nfalling numbers of university appli-cants. Many people, including prominent academics and public \ufb01gures,\nattribute this to the rise in popularity\nof Brian Cox. Professor Peter Main\nof the Institute of Physics agrees with\nthis assessment, saying that Brian\nCox \u201cdemysti\ufb01es\u201d physics.\nSpeaking to The Telegraph last\nweek, he said, \u201cAbout 10 years ago\u2026\npeople used to say \u2018If only we could\nget a face of physics\u2019 like David Attenborough for biology\u201d.\nManchester University\u2019s own physics course has increased in popularity with last year\u2019s \ufb01gures breaking\nthrough the 1000 \ufb01gure in 2012,\ncompared to 850 in 2009. We have\nlearned from a Manchester physics\nstudent that this led to an internal\nsurvey being sent to all 1st year physics undergraduates. The students\nwere asked whether Brian Cox had\na\ufb00ected their decision in applying\nto the university. The responses may\nhave been signi\ufb01cant in the decision to assign the Quantum Physics course for this year\u2019s students to\nBrian Cox.\nManchester is also capitalising on\nits position by being the \ufb01rst University to include two A*s in the entry\nrequirements for Physics degrees.\nThere are of course other reasons\nmooted for the increase in physics\napplications, and plausible to suggest that Brian Cox\u2019s popularity may\nbe the e\ufb00ect, rather than the cause,\nof a renewed interest in physics. Prof\nSir Peter Knight, president of the Institute of Physics, has even discussed\nNiall Jeffrey Reporter\ncontributing factors such as geek-chic and The Big Bang Theory.\nUnfortunately for Imperial stu-dents, if we want a Brian Cox for ourselves we will have to get our own,\nas the man himself has on multiple\noccasions declared his love of Manchester and his reluctance to leave.\nOf course you\u2019ll apply\nto Manchester with\nthose \u201ccome hither\u201d\neyes. Touch my\nhadron now Brian\n\n"
