Hufllet) was unable to play, which caused\nsome team pair rearrangements. However, S. Willis was able to play and contributed\ngreatly to the team's win. The li rst pair\n( H. K.Wong and I. Bull) again continued\ntheir 100% record winning all three ol their\nmatches, though they did drop a set against\nthe QM C first pair\u2014don't do it again!\nThe second pair won two out ol three,\nwhich is a good start lor the newcomer to the\nteam G. Adamson.\nThe third pair won only one out ol three,\nprobably due to complacency brought by the\nsuccess of the li rst two pairs.\nThe final result was 0-3 to IC. The Mens 1\nhave now won the first four matches of the\nseason and look strong enough to win the rest\nprovided the team can be consistent in their\nattendance (yes, Chris!).\nTeam:/.. Yap, H.K. Wong, 1. Bull, G. Adamson, T. Lai, ,V. Willis.\n& Rugby\nGutteridge Cup\nA lethargic Imperial XV played an equally\nlethargic Royal Holloway XV in a game\nwhich must have bored the pants of all the\nkeen supporters. Considering the importance\nof the game, the lack of urgency, particularly\nin the backs, was worrying.\nThe forwards, especially the Iront row of\nMan zon i, de Rohan, always keen in the\nloose, too, and Richards were in line form. As\na result the pack provided more than a fair\nshare of clean ball going forwards, but the\nball was invariably lost or wasted by a back\ndivision which still hasn't learned the art of\nrunning onto a ball.\nThe lin al result was 7-0 in favour of IC,a result which could have been much greater\nhad the IC \"kickers\" been in any sort of\nform\u2014only one kick was successful out ol\nmore than ten attempts. The only try ol the\nday came from R. Downs, the right wing.\nTeam: P. Eastland, R. Downs, A. Davies, P. Hardee, O. Miles, G. Fazakerley,. S. Johns, J. Manzoni, C. de Rohan, P. Richards, A. Warhy\n(Capt), P. Verity, D. McGee, W. Aston, W. King.\n(fj Football\nFirsts\nFollowing a\" tactical\" reshuffle of the \" crap\" midfield, IC First XI strolled (?) to a30 win\nat Kings. The team were treated to an ind ep th analysis of their deficiencies by\nStephen 'Gielgud' Ward. The first half was very/extremely/pretty\nunexciting( Phil rose and headed the\nball/man). The one incident of note was Aled\nWilliams' destruction of the opposing forward with the efficiency of a Panza Division, \"dislocating\" his shoulder in the\nprocess. (Phil headed the ball again!) No one realised that our keeper had concussion,\nhe knew little about the second half! Carr and Rick ard scored.\nfn the second half, Rick ard began challenging Niccoll's domination, heading\nthe ball twice, proving that the ball is softer\nthan the head. Phil finally established his\nsuperiority with....\" Phil' s ball.... No, it\nisn't!\", as he drifted a good two yards\nunderneath it! Steve \" Well he kicked me\nearlier on\"Ward practiced euthanasia on\ntheir forward and then collected a superb\nstraight right from Williams.\nFinally, Dean turned on a manhole cover\nand squeezed it in, to prove that the net does\nstop the ball....why does he always fall over?\nTeam: Same as usual.\nQ Sailing\nThe IC team were at the \" Harp\" on\nSaturday to sail two teams from Surrey\nUniversity.\nThe morning races started in very light\nwind but despite this the somewhat heavier\nIC team beat the Surrey ladies team in two\nraces.\nOver lunch the wind strengthened and was\nnear ideal for team racing by the time the\nli rst race against Surrey's first team was due.\nShowing overall greater racing ability they\nfinally won being li rst, third, and fourth.\nThe second race also saw IC in defeat\nbeing in fourth, filth and sixth places\nrounding the final mark and despite a marvellous lin al beat by Kennedy taking him\nfrom fifth to second place. The team again\nlost being second, fifth and sixth.\nTeam: Dalton, Kennedy, Mills, Redman,\nToslevin, 1 o ung husband. Squash\nLast week saw the Seconds and Thirds maintain their unbeaten records (just), while\nthe Firsts and Fourths both suffered bad\ndefeats.\nIC 1 vs London Hosp 1 1-4(A) IC 2 vs LSE22'/,2'>, IC 2 vs Westlield 3-2(A) IC 3 vs London Hosp 2 2' j2'. IC 4 vs Middlesex Hosp 3 0-5(H)All four courts at the Sports Centre have\nnow been repaired and members should find\nthat bookings are available for Monday and\nWednesday evenings.\nHockey\nLadies\nOn Wednesday, November 4, IC Ladies\nHockey team played a league match against\nChelsea College. There were several long\ncorners given to IC yet they did not succeed\nin scoring. Fortunately Chelsea College also\ndid not score and at half-time the score was\nan exasperating 0-0.\nIC, determined to put the ball past\nChelsea's goalie, kept the pressure going and\nmanaged to score. Unfortunately the\nopponents also scored and so IC had to leave\nthe pitch with a11 draw.\nMany thanks to Chris Tily who had the\njob of umpiring for both sides.\nFirsts\nIC began this game with high hopes or\nretaining their 100% record on Wednesdays.\nIt was soon apparent, however, that the team\nwas intent on lowering its standards to equal\nthose ol the opposition. Thus, despite much\nterritorial and possession al advantage, and\nwith dubious umpiring, the Firsts failed to\nannihilate the opposition. In the end a disappointed Imperial team had to settle for\none point.\nTeam: Butler, Coaleswor/h, Riley, Franklin,\nParker, Clarke, Rao, Ayers, Bell, Bateson.\nUL Mens 6-a side\nAfter meeting early on a cold Sunday morning the IC hockey six-a side squad\nheaded lor Motspur Park somewhere down\nthe A3. The competition took the form of seven\ngroups to play as a league the winners of each\ngroup going through to quarter-finals. The\nother colleges in our group were Bedford,\nMiddlesex, Wye and Guys, of whom Bedford\ndid not turn up, leaving only three games for\nIC to play in the group. IC won their group\nwithout conceding a goal, beating Guys 6-0,\nMiddlesex 2-0, and drawing with Wye 0-0.\nThe opposition in the quarter-final was\nGoldsmiths who we beat easily 3-0, while\ntrying to conserve energy for the semi-final.\nHaving sensed the possibility of winning\nthe tournament, the IC team quickly dispensed of Westminster in the semi-finals\nby beating them 2-0.\nThis took us into the final against QE C, the match being played immediately due to\nfading light. Both teams were tired and IC were under some initial pressure during which time QE C scored, the shot being\nsqueezed past a defender on the line. IC then\nbegan to use the full width of the pitch and\ntook command of the game, keeping the ball\nin the QE C half. The aggressive play was\nrewarded by a goal from Bansal to even the\nscore line at 1-1. Although keeping QE C under pressure IC were unable to capital is e and the score at the final whistle stood at 1-1.\nUnder the competition rules an extra period\nof up to five minutes was to be played with\nthe first team to score being the winners. IC\nresumed the game in an energetic manner\nand sustained pressure on the QE C defence\nwas rewarded by a well-taken goal from Bell.\nHence IC won the competition scoring a total of fifteen goals while conceding only\none. The squad was Ayers, Riley, Coatesworth, Clarke, Franklin, Rao, Bansal, Bell.\nPage 10 FELIX, November 13, 1981\n\n"

Jezebel was built in191 GAD which by no st ref ch of the imagination is post\n1 9 6 5 ( unless1965 BC was meant).2. We were not any less\norganised than Guilds, merely that being the more mature element in College, we get less\nexcitable about these things\nthan Guilds men( the kiddies\nmust have their fun we suppose).\n3. The number in the RCS contingent was 19, not the 10\nstated, but since the article\nwas probably written by a Guilds man this is only to be\nexpected. We all know that\nmost Guilds men have difficulty in counting above seven,\nso allowances must be made. We hope this clears the\nmatter in your reader's mind. Tours sincerely\nAndy Smith, RCS Motor Club Chairman PS: Incidentally J ez returned to London under her own power, unlike certain plastic-bodied li at s we know. Ed's note: I must admit that\n19G5 was a misprint, but am assured by my correspondent that the sources of his information were yourself and lazy\nDP Barney McCabe. So it seems that the pair of you were\neither too drunk or too stupid to remember! Tour Honour and everyone else\nI arrived home today to\nfind my friend Caroline( we\nlive together you know)n early in tears. \" Why?\", you may ask. Well, I shall enlighten you \u2014 she'd been to\nthe Launder ett e.Yes, that\nrevolting, over illuminated, noisy, seat deficient, dirty establishment at the end of\nthe road. Not only was it\n1000% demoralizing it was\nalso extremely expensive (this\nalso added to the\" near suicidal\" state, although the\nthe price of a coffin these days\nshe thought again \u2014 how considerate!). Anyway, why can't we have some kind of\nnice launder et te in College? Or, to put it another way: how do we go about getting\none, if at all possible, please?\nDoes anyone put there agree\nwith me?\nl ours devotedly, desperately, and\nmoi I' sincere! yJ org in a Pertegas Plans Me chEng3 Sir\nI had just bought a brand new mechanics book from the IC Bookshop, and after\nlovingly removing it from the\npaper bag and care lull peel-ing off the I CB price tag, for\n\u00a38.50, I found to my disgust\nthat underneath the price tag printed on the back cover of\nthe book, was the UK recommended price of \u00a3 7 . 5 0 . Is\nthere any explanation as to\nwhy I CB charged SI more than the recommended price?\nAdrian Harris\nDear Sir\nI have always regarded the\nlute use Young Men of the IC Christian Union with a somewhat paradoxical mix ture of pity, contempt, and admiration. Surely one must\nadmire the determination ol the IY M\" spreading the Word\" in the face of seemingly\nin assailable apathy. However, alter hearing the curiously entitled \" Black Pink Square\" one canon lv conclude that\n\u2022\nthey approach their daunting task with a dedication of spirit\napproaching the sublime. Having made the not inconsiderable effort ol listen-ing to the recording, Iam impressed by its remarkable consistency \u2014 it is equally appalling in content, humour and quality( both artistic and technical). It has helped me reach the now obvious conclusion that Satan worship is\nthe only tenable doctrine available to the thinking man. No doubt many others think likewise; perhaps there now exists a demand for anIC Satanic Union, complete with a room in the Union or Southside for daily Black Mass. It is most likely that the\nIG CU Mission will pass unnoticed by most; however, the thought of the Thespians' Cornerstone' wandering about IC, resembling a pack of rabid, penniless minstrels,\nis one too horrible to eon-template. To think I had always considered Rag to be\ndull!' l ours, ek.,\nLeo Her mac in ski Dear Sir\nImperial College Conservative Society believes it is\nnow time for realism. The balance of power between NATO and the Warsaw Pact is growing ever\nmore precarious. Multilateral disarmament negotiations have been going on for years\nwithout success. Both East\nand West have the ability to\ndestroy each other several times over, yet they continue to stockpile nuclear weapons.\nPeople are starving and dying of disease in Third World countries, while dev eloped nations argue that\nthey must reduce their aid in the current economic climate. The arms race has escalated\nbeyond the point of Mutual Assured Destruction and the\nold fashioned policy of deter-rence. Reagan has admitted that America is prepared to\nlight a\" limited\" nuclear war in Europe. The potential destruction ol the entire human race is at\nstake, but it is refreshing to see\nthat a computer error was\nspotted while American bombers were in the process\nof beginning a nuclear war. It is ironic that members of\nConservative Society consider\nthis situation to be realistic:\nreal it may be, but it is also\nabsurd. Tours sincerely\nRobert Kelsey Ci vEng2 Dear Mark\nLast week you asked for letters about\" anything which really gets your goat\". Well so-me one's got my goat an dI'd like it back please.

In a very short time a134 lead had been built up. Unfortunately Peter\nRong e injured an ankle preventing him taking any further part in the game. After the\nsubstitution IC went on to finish oil the first\nset 15-4. In the second set the absence olT C's centre smasher became apparent as they\nstruggled to reorganise themselves. This resulted in the set being the closest of the\nmatch, the score 15-9 to Imperial. In the final\nset Imperial showed a marked improvement\nto win comfortably 15-4. The most notable\naspect of this set was Peter Walker winning\nten consecutive points on his service. In the\nend the score line was probably more impressive than the performance merited and\nthe fact that IC were never in any trouble\nwas mainly due to the d is organisation of the\nopposition.\nThanks this week go to Caroline for\nmastering the score sheet and Silvana for the\nphotography.\nTeam: P.

Team selection was very\ntricky but was solved by combining the mens\nand womens teams, leaving the crippled Pete\nHoldsworth as team photographer.\nRussell Weston made a valiant el fort on\nthe first leg against stiff opposition. Robert\nMorrison ran a good leg to pave the way for\nCaroline Walton to make her debut for IC.

The\nblues beat the reds 3-2 with Rickard scoring a hat-trick for IC. Phil kept passing to the lovely\nred shirts, pity he had a blue one on. Kev passed to Graham with the efficiency of\nArnold Palmer with a sand iron, and he\nscored. Then it was half-time, but I didn't get a piece of orange again.\nThe reds scored two goals. It looked like\ncurtains, but it was just the pretty kits. Then Rick ard scored and scored again. The blues\nwere smiling, well it could have been the sun\non their super-sheen shirts. Then the nice\nreferee blew his whistle (shine y, not plastic).\nPP S: Can you make me some nice pompoms for my socks? By the way the team was\nthe same as usual, but different.\nSeconds\nA well-turned out (thanks Dave) IC team\nstarted with an unfair advantage as Captain Ron Wiggins had to referee, thus reducing IC to ten men and eliminating our midfield\nweakness. IC got off to a good start when Jim Beer and Andy Hartland combined to\nscramble the ball over the line following a corner. With Martin Armstrong marking the\nentire LSE midfield, IC went further ahead\nwith a well-taken Hartland goal. LSE then\nreplied with a goal that was only twenty\nyards offside (thanks Ron).\nThe second half started with IC under\ntremendous pressure but the defence held out\nand a break down the left led to yet another\ntap-in (sorry Jim, brilliant goal) from J. Beer\nEsq. This was quickly followed by the goal of\nthe season from Andy Hartland who made\namends lor missing ten open goals on Wednesday by smashing the ball in from\nwide on the right.

Only ten players\nturned up and Kings took the lead after two\nminutes.\nHowever the tide soon turned when new\nboy Will Faull didn't on three occasions and\ncompleted his hattrick inside tw:\nen ty minutes; his first and third goals being of the\nhighest quality. Unfortunately two defensive\nerrors allowed Kings to equalize before half-time.\nMidway through the second half Kings scored again and then lost a player themselves through injury.\nFinally with about three minutes left Tom Donovan received the ball eighteen yards\nfrom the Kings goal and after what seemed\nan age released it to Pete Fishwick who\nperformed the honours and secured another\nlate draw with a line shot to the net.\nTeam: R.

Body.\nFootnote: Quote from Rob Bird, Manager and\ngoalie \"Does anyone know any goalies?\"\nft Hockey\nFirsts\nThis match being a friendly, the Captain decided to experiment with a few positional\nchanges. After settling down, the team completed well, and Sonning were a bit\nfortunate to.take the lead midway through\nthe first half.\nAfter the interval, we increased the\npressure on the opposition keeper, and eventually gained a der ved equalise r scored\nby Rao.\nThanks go to Phil Webb for umpiring.\nTeam: Bullet, Coalesworth, Riley, Franklin,\nClarke, Bell, Ayers, Bansal, Rao, Cray, Galley.\nSeconds\nA tremendous performance by the Seconds\nwho, despite being forced to play with only\nnine men, totally outplayed a strong Sonning\nteam. Our work rate was never matched by\nSonning and it paid dividends early in the\ngame when one of Gordon Wylies many\nfine runs brought a short corner.\nAndy Whitehead brought all his defensive\nskills to bear in striking the corner; executing\na clean stop and then making a total cock-up\nof the shot! The ball trickled forward to Mike Pitkethley who chipped it past the goalkeeper\nfor Tim Mitchell to sweep home. Sonning\nthen tried to lilt themselves and finally got a goal from a long corner when our lack of\nnumbers told against us.\nAt half-time the Sonning captain offered to\nlet us have one of their players, to which we\nwere tempted to reply that he could have one\nof ours! This attitude was firmly vindicated\nin the second half as we continued to put the\nopposition under pressure. The winner came\nthrough Andy St roomer who, having convinced the goalkeeper that he had totally\nlost control, finally managed to score from\nthe narrowest of angles.\nThe defence hung on superbly to give us a deserved victory which was enjoyed by\neveryone (even Sonning!).\nTeam: Jones, Roessink, Ramplon, Whitehead,\nPilkethly, Slroomer, Farmer, Wylie, Mitchell.\nThirds\nIC would have won this game but for a lew\nproblems. These problems arose in the last\nquarter of the game consisting of three goals\nscored by the opposition. Despite the fact\nthat three goals were conceded the defence\nplayed well with Chris and Steve holding the\nattack well and then supporting our own\nattack with some good passes. The first goal\nwas unfortunate as it was scored when the\nball was thought to have been cleared. The\nother two goals came as IC pushed forward\nthrough the midfield with some good play by\nBrian, trying to get the draw we deserved.\nThe frontline of Tim, Martin and Ed created some good chances but were unable\nto convert them into goals. Over a few jars\n(40pa pint) after the game it was decided\nthat we all played well and there was much\ncomplementing and praising by the IC Thirds sell-appreciation group.\nMany thanks to Andy Purdy, who is still\ninjured, for doing a good job as umpire.\nTeam: M. Taylor (Captain), T. Allen, E. McGuire, E. Mahers, G. Shindler. S. Witter, S. Williams, C. Pound, C. Callell, P. Sharpe.\nUmpire:.1. Purdy.\nFELIX, November 13, 1981 Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "An American Werewolf in London Cert X Director John Landis Starring David\nNaughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny\nAgutter. Now showing at the Odeon\nLeicester Square.\nDavid and Jack, two young American hitchhikers, brave the moors of Northern\nEngland on the first step of their European\ntour, but are attacked by a savage animal\nunder the full moon. Jack is killed and David\nwakes up three weeks later in a London\nhospital. He is visited by the undead spirit of\nhis friend who tells David that he will become a werewolf in two days time and must kill himself\nin order to release the undead from limbo and\nprevent further deaths.\nNow all this may sound fairly ridiculous and\nthat is what director John Landis exploits to\ncreate a unique and horrific \"comedy\" film.\nBeing visited by a wise-cracking corpse is\nenough to make you think you've lost your\nmarbles, but turn into a werewolf and eat\npeople? Never.\nWhat follows is one of the most unusual and\ntechnically sound films of recent years. The big\ntreat is, of course, the transformation sequence. This was pre-emp ted a little in The\nHowling (which Landis admitted \"pissed me\noff\" and \"stole our thunder\") but Landis' film is\nin a completely different class, using the\ntransformation as part of and not just the\nclimax of action. Full credit must go to Rick\nBaker for an amazing two minute sequence in\nwhich bone and skin are stretched and\nsnapped as David becomes a werewolf before\nyour eyes. There are only mechanical effects\nA big hand for David Kessler, or more appropriately for director John Landis and Rick\nBaker (who created some extraordinary make-up and effects). The film was first shown\nat the London Film Festival and premiered on Wednesday... .under the full moon.\n(not special optical s) which are particularly\nimpressive when David's hand elongates to a paw and a snout bursts forward and sprouts\nfangs.\nAdmitted the film has its faults: the\ncompleted werewolf runs around on all fours in\na most unconvincing manner (the upright\ngiants in The Howling being more impressive)\nand for a wolfman movie which avoids all of the\nnormal clich es, it is sad that the ending is so\nappallingly predictable.\nNevertheless, I cannot remember a film\nwhich actually scared me and made me laugh,\noccasionally at the same time. Oh yes, and\nwait around for the final credits as there are a few funny lines there too. (Any resemblance to\nany characters living, dead or undead )\nOne for all you old-time horror buffs (as well\nas Animal House fans) but not for the\nSqueamish Mark Smith\n: , _ i aw\n\u00a9\nCitizens Band Cert AA Director Jonathan\nDemme Starring Paul la Mat, Candy Clark\nNow showing at the Paris Pulman\nThe concept of silicon narc is sm embraced\nwithout question or contradiction. The films\nplural plot, structured about twentieth century\ntechnology, offers the opportunity for an\nexploration of individual relationships within a society under stress. Instead the vestige of a promising story crumbles into a monogamous\nm ish mash. The only real hero to emerge\nfrom this film is the corporate individual\ncelebrating his isolation in an act of\nignominious masturbation. This is glory.\nThe films st acc at to, minimal, opening scenes, that promise much that is not fulfilled,\nare bound together by the disembodied sensual lit y of 'Electra' whose voice alone is\nenough to cause the virginal 'Warlock' to\nejaculate amidst his soft focus, soft music\nfantasies. The twist is that Electra herself is\nfrustrated by her jumbled affairs with Blaine\nand Dean, two brothers who represent the\nacceptable opposites of behaviour. Blaine, the\nrebel down to his open shirt, is eventually\ngiven the civic seal of approval for rescuing a hapless lorry driver, Chrome Angel, while\nDean is the coach on a school team who\ncompetes for the prettiest prize but loses her\nto Blaine whom he finally forgives from the\nentrenched safety of an American nuclear\nfamily.\nIn fact all the conflicts are eventually\nresolved within a manifestation of the\nAmerican dream. Even Chrome Angel, who is\ndiscovered to be a bigamist, does not cross the\nbounds of male sexuality within the family and\ninstead practices a form of duplicate monogamy while the technical and physical\nseparation of Blaine and Electra is deified by aCB wedding ceremony. No contact, no illusion\ndisturbed. You are left with the impression\nthat Electra is closer to Warlock and his lonely\nmasturbation than to her future husband.\nHowever, once she is married she is of no\nmore interest to any other character and even\nWarlock is seen disappearing after the doyen\nof female sexuality, a prostitute named Debbie\nand the one woman in this film who is allowed,\nto some extent, to express herself without a man. but even she has a pseudo-husband in\nChrome Angel, who flaunts the decayed ethos\nnl male promiscuity.\nThe promise of this film, however, apart\nfrom the schizophrenic interest generated by\neach character having two names, a normal\nand a CB handle, is lost in a vapid reenactment of ethics given wheels and the\nanger in loneliness of the characters and the\ndichotomy of a dual plot are never fully\nexploited.\nDavid Gill\nVicky and Bert y go Fishing Time and Place Sunday, November 15, 10:30 after IC Bar\nNight.

This time\nwe took to wheels and spent last Saturday and\nSunday cycling around the Chilterns. We\narrived in small groups during Friday evening\nat Ffenly Youth Hostel close to a delightful\nstretch of the Thames. On Saturday we cycled\nwest and north through woods and open\nhillsides along the ridge of the Chilterns. Return to the hostel was down a five mile long\nhill with very little traffic and no sharp bends.\nThis hill l and the flat stretch at the bottom\nmeant the last seven miles were covered in\ntwenty minutes.\nOn Sunday we headed north io West\nWycombe along one of the many valleys in the\narea. At West Wycome we walked up a small\nhill to a viewpoint and also descended into the\nhillside in the old chalk workings. We then\nmade the mistake of following Dave Marshall\nto the station at High Wycombe. His answer to\na road closed in the centre of town was to lead\nus up a very long one in seven hill and then\nstraight down again to a point not far from\nwhere we started.\nAs to the future, tonight a group is off to the\nCotswolds, in two weeks there is a trip to\nSnowdonia and on the final weekend before\nthe break its the Yorkshire Dales. For information about any of these come along to\nour weekly meetings in Southside Upper Lounge on Thursday, 12:30 till 2:00.\nConsoc\nLast Friday's visit to the House of Commons\nwas a success. After a quick visit to St.\nStephan's Tavern the party went to the\nvisitors' gallery in the Commons for about an\nhour. The session then finished and we met\nPeter Brooke, the local MP, and then had a guided tour of the Houses of Parliament.\nA few tickets for the Anyone for Denis\ntheatre trip on November 24 are still available.\nIf you would like to go, contact Geoff Knox c/o Chem Eng letter-racks, and include \u00a33.50 (by\ncheque) per ticket required.\nOn Tuesday, November 17 we have our\nfirst speaker meeting of the year: William\nWhitelaw MP will be speaking about his post\nas Home Secretary in Mech Eng 220 at\n1:00pm. Seats are reserved for members at\nthe front until ten minutes to one.\nJohn Pattison\nIndustrial\nMore propaganda from the \"Industry is Great\"\npublicity machine.\nFollowing the tremendous success of the\nBritish Gas and Unilever talks, on Monday,\nNovember 16, a top executive addresses a no-doubt-packed Chem Eng Theatre 1 on the\nsubject \" Education and Industry \u2014 How it\naffects you!\" The action begins at 1:00pm, so\nbe there early to be sure of a seat!\nThe Amazing Arthur Anderson Business\nGame is held on Wednesday, November 18, so\nthose budding Arnold Weinstocks who are\nindulging had better not forget!!\nOn Friday, November 20, a posse of motor\nfiends leaves at 12:45 from Beit Arch for the\nFord Production line at Dagenham, so hurry\nout of lechers! Also, if you can't go on a trip,\nplease cancel (Mark Skeates, DoC2) as soon\nas possible so that our reserves can step in; our\nMark often rips to shreds those who turn up\nlate to cancel!\nAction Group\nSoup runs as usual\u2014details in What'sOn column.\nNext draught proofing session is on\nNovember 25 (Wednesday afternoon) which\ninvolves going to about two houses and\nblocking tbe cracks in windows and doors for\nelderly people. Come to the meeting at 12:30\non Monday at the top of the Union Building for\ndetails.\nAnyone interested in helping with hand i capped children on Saturdays in Action please\ncome to the meeting as well.\nAnyone interested in helping battered\nwives? This can be done by taking their\nchildren out for trips to museums, etc. This is\ngreat fun for the children and helpers and also\na big help for their mothers. Please, if you are\ninterested contact Loraine Weeks, Falmouth\n228 or ICCA G, meeting at 12:30 at the top of\nthe Union Building on Monday. No regular\ncommitment needed.\nAmnesty\nThis week IC Amnesty launched its campaign\nin earnest; for the release of our adopted\nprisoner. Mr Firiman Awadon, who has been\nheld without change since November 1979, in\nBenin.\nWe wish to thank everybody who participated in the letter-signing yesterday, and we\nhope that this will help to improve Mr Awadon's conditions in prison.\nThe letter-writing was arranged to coincide\nwith Benin's National Day (when we hope that\nthe letters will arrive) and this should greatly\nhelp to improve the chances of his release.\nIf you are interested in helping to secure the\nrelease of prisoners of conscience around the\nworld please come to the Amnesty meeting,\nevery Tuesday, 5:30pm, Green Committee\nRoom (top floor of the Union Building).\nSF Soc\nAll the Soc events for the rest of this term will\nbe on a completely different plane from last\nTuesdays film (shaggy-god story or diabolical\nLigeti as some prefer) apart from the maybe\nevents (the famous not yet revealed). Next on\nthe agenda is a live event, namely 'Super-heroes What's My Line?' a bona game for\npeople with ab of fo sense of humour, last won\nby Adam Adamant. This occurs on Tuesday,\nNovember 17 in the Green Committee Room.\nPossible unconfirmed events I'm allowed to\ntalk about include a visit from SF author\nBarrington Bayley (not a pseudonym), the man\nresponsible for the strangest short story I 've\never read, and a showing of Sex Pirates of the\nBlood Asteroid about which more some other\ntime. Material wanted for NME3, the world's worst fanzine. No \u2014 I take that back. Previous\nissues have contained articles on: the bra in\nSF; how to be hip in a post-street society; the\nchocolate cake in SF; and how to make a Moebius postcard. Just imagine it! A nSF Soc\nBulletin 28 pages long! But be warned, we\nwon't accept any old rubbish. Just most old\nrubbish (illustrations, reviews, articles, poetry,\nminutes, cartoons, sediment from your subconscious smeared on a page (fiction),\napo the gm s, incriminating photos, music, used\nsafety matchboxes, etc.) 10-10 till we do it\nagain.\nJasperodus and Boffin the Golden Dustmnn\nAngling\nLast Thursday (Nov 5) at our regular meeting\nin Southside Bar, the club committee was\nformed consisting of: Chairman Dave Kelsall;\nSecretary Victor Batorijs; Treasurer John Davies; Freshwater Captain Steve Edlridge;\nand two auxiliary committee members Andy\nChapman and Dave Johnson. The post of Sea\nCommodore remains open. We now also have\na constitution which is in the process of being\nsubmitted. As for our next outing, this will be\non Saturday, November 14 (any enquiries ring\nDave Kelsall on int 2594) and hopefully there\nwill be an outing every fortnight from now on,\nIf you want to know more about the club come\nto Southside Bar at 6:00pm any Thursday and\nmeet some members.\nYacht\nSixteen members, mainly beginners, travelled\ndown to Lymington for the IC Yacht Club's second outing this season.\nContrary to the weather forecast of gales\nand rain, Saturday provided surprisingly\nwarm, sunny weather and a15k nt following\nwind. Some very energetic fore deck work\nenabled the OOD34 to arrive at our first\nscheduled stop \u2014 Cowes, on' the Isle of\nWight\u2014just before the Red Admiral 37. The\nappearance of a man demanding money for\nmooring combined with the fact that the pubs\nhad closed, prompted a quick decision to sail\nimmediately for Gosport, our port of call for\nthe night.\nThe evening was misspent in an elusive pub,\nthe name of which has been washed from our\nmemories by Gales Best.\nWith the arrival of Sunday morning it was\nsoon apparent that the weather and both the\nskippers had deteriorated. The beat back to\nLymington in 25-35kn t winds and poor visibility\nwas very exhilarating and gave the crews of\nthe boats a taste of real sailing.\nThe next Yacht Club meeting will take place\nin the Botany Common Room at 12:30pm on\nThursday.\nDave Martin\nBookshop News\nAs you know, so long as there is a demand, the\nBookshop will stock most things. Often we are\nguided by requests from students or tutors. As\nthe main request the past week has been for\near plugs I would be grateful if the tutor\nconcerned could get in touch with me, so I will\nhave some idea as to the number of students\nwho will want them.\nNext week Open University Press will be\nexhibiting a wide range of their titles, both in\nthe shop and in the window.\nNew Titles\nLy/e Antique Review, 7.50\nLy/e Arts Review, \u00a37.50\nLy/e Arms and Armour Review, \u00a37.50\nAntique Dealers Pocket Book, \u00a32.50\nBasic Astronomy by H.

    "content": "Rag MagI personally couldn't give two hoots about\nwhat happens to the Rag Mag now. I can see\nthat it might have caused offence and as a majority of people agree to banning it, then\nthat's fair enough. I trust now that efforts will\nbe doubled by those who voted to ban it to\nrecoup the lost money.\nHowever, I doubt that this will happen. The\npeople who turned out en masse to vote\nseemed to be the religious groups in College. I doubt whether many of these people will\nbother putting in extra time to collect money.\nThis brings me on to the two things which\nhave really annoyed me over the whole affair.\nFirstly, the Chaplaincy have deliberately\ndisobeyed the Council motion (restricting\nsales of the magazine to IC students) by\nsending it out to several charities, such as\nLe pra( the British Leprosy Association). What's the point in banning it to preserve the\nso-called \"good name\" of Imperial College\nwhen the Chaplaincy have done their best to\nspread the word all over the country? These\nself-righteous prat s should have waited until\nafter the U GM before trying to apply external\npressures, if it was at all necessary. However\nthey jumped the gun and have caused much of\nthe damage they claim they were trying to\nprevent.\nSecondly, the proposer of the amended\nmotion to ban the Rag Mag, Stephen Goulder\nsaid \"I worked in a pathology lab over the\nsummer, which was next to a spastics home. I certainly don't find spastic jokes funny.\"\nWhat he failed to mention was the reason\nfor his credit in the magazine. His contribution:\nHow does a burns victim pick his nose?\nOut of a catalogue.\nHe failed to mention that on the other side of\nthe pathology lab was a burns unit. Do I smell a hypocrite?\nThe highlight of Rag Week at Primelia College\nis the celebrated d wile fl on king competition. In\neach round, each of two contestants tries to\nfl on k the other'sd wile before his own is\nfl on ke d.As soon as the judge decides that\nthere has been a valid fl on king, the loser retires\nand the winner stays on to meet a newcomer in\na new round. The entire process is repeated\nover and over until seventeen rounds have\nbeen fought.\nThis year there were seven contestants,\nnone of whom ever played as many as three\nconsecutive rounds. Crumble, the reigning\nchampion, suffered the humiliation of being the\nfirst of all the competitors to have his d wile fl on ke d, although to his credit, he didn't lose a round thereafter.\nWho played whom? Well Bumble and Drudge each played a round with each of the\nothers. Amble' played two rounds with Eager\nLinks Cup I received the following letter from some of\nthe College members of the Links Club.\nDear Mark\nThe Links' Cup was taken from the Union\nBar last Thursday evening and a forfeit trail has\nbeen set for its return. The Cup is not a violate\nmascot, it is simply a Club possession. If we\nwere to comply with the demands of those who\nhave the Cup, this would set a precedent that\nany grudge against a club or society could be\nsettled by stealing possessions of that club or\nsociety and demanding such forfeits. For this\nreason we must decline the Treasure Trail and\nask those who have taken the Cup to arrange\nfor its return. We invite those who criticise the\nClub to express their views in the pages of\nFELIX, but beg that they consider the many\nmembers no longer at College who value the\nCup greatly and against whom they can surely\nhold no personal grudge.\nYours sincerely\nThe College members of the Links Club.\nPenthouse Flat\nVery soon after I started asking questions\nabout the empty pen thous flats above Southside (which were formerly occ up pied by\ntwo wardens) the miraculous decision was\nmade to rent them out from January.\nHowever, this means that a term's rent has\nalready been lost (amounting to over \u00a32,000)\nfor no good reason. Why weren't the flats\nready for use in October? It seems that\nFalmouth/Keogh Warden Dr Paul Jowitt is\nbeing particularly greedy in demanding a bigger flat, supposedly because of his family\n(but, more likely I think, because he wants a flat as big as Dr Hutchinson's, the Tizard/\nSelkirk Warden). Not only this, but his new flat\nmust be redecorated before he moves in, so he\nis effectively holding on to two penthouse flats.\nAgain it seems that nobody took a decision\nuntil embarrassing questions were asked. This\nmust be true, because the final decision on\nrenting out the flats was left until last\nWednesday. Would someone care to explain\nwhy?\nCredits An awful lot of my time has been saved by the\naid of the following: Lesley, Martin, Christine,\nPeter, Paul, Eddie, Shams, Caroline, Jes.\nI must lastly point out that Dave Wetzel, the\nGLC Transport spokesman (who is partly\nresponsible for the Fare's Fair scheme) will be\nat College on Tuesday.\nand one with Crumble. Eager fl on ke d the\nd wiles of Fumble and Grumble.\nNow if you count up, you will see that I 've\nnamed the two contestants in sixteen of the\nrounds. The missing round (which may have\ninvolved contestants who had met on another\noccasion) was played between whom?\nSolutions, comment, criticism to me at the\nFELIX Office by Wednesday 1:00pm, please.\n\u00a35 (donated by Mend-a Bike) to the correct\nentry randomly selected at that time.\nLast Week's Solution\n61181 which, by an astounding coincidence, is\nthe date on which the puzzle was set. Chris\nBrannick, Maths 1, can collect his fiver on\nMonday afternoon.\nLast week's hero, Weatherspoon, is based\non a character in a children's puppet series\nwhich was shown on television when I was\nabout eight years old. ' featured a jolly\nking/duke, a snooty queen/duchess with an\nequally snooty pet dragon called Pongo, and in\nthe cat-infested basement of their home lived a dodder y mad scientist called Weatherspoon.\nCan anyone remember more about the series\n(e.g. its title)?

    "content": "EXEC VIEWS\nThe response at the U GM to the demonstration on November 18 was\nnot exactly overwhelming. The day of action is important to show the\ngovernment that lecturers, non-academic staff and students are strongly\nopposed to the cutbacks in the university sector. Please consider going\neven if you were not attracted to the idea at the meeting.\nThe day of action was actually initiated by the Association of University\nTeachers ( AUT). The other university trade unions and NUS decided to\njoin in. Staff and students are coming from all over the country. They will\nbe lobbying MPs and holding meetings at Westminster.\nIn London, the issue was specifically taken up with relation to hard hit\ncolleges, specifically Chelsea College. So, all involved in London are\ngoing to march from Chelsea to Westminster.\nIf you want to take part in the march and lobby simply turn up in the\nUnion Office at 12:30pm on Wednesday, November 18. However, it\nwould be a help if you gave me your name and address in advance as our\ncampus trade unions have a plan to organise people into constituency\ngroups.\nNick\nInsuring a fair deal?\nThe seasonal epidemic of salesman in the IC Halls selling Life\nAssurance is probably almost over, but for anyone who may still be\nwithin the ten day 'cooling-off period, or has not yet been\napproached, here are a few facts and comments that may effect a cure or provide some immunity.\nThe main reasons put forward for taking out Life Assurance seem\nto be as an investment and/or to protect any dependants. For most\nstudents these ends may be best achieved through separate\narrangements such as a building society account plus term insurance\nfor life cover only (this can cost as little as \u00a310-15per yr for \u00a310,000\ncover). For a clear analysis of the benefits and disadvantages of life\nassurance, life insurance and various investment schemes try Money\nWhich (Sept and June 1979, available from the Haldane Library). The\nmagazine does not recommend any type of whole life assurance for\nanyone, but finds that life assurance linked to a building society\nscheme and index-linked save-as-you-earn investments are worth\nconsidering, depending on your circumstances.\nIf you are approached by a salesman or seek advice from\ninsurance brokers, or insurance company agents, such as\naccountants, solicitors and estate agents, it is worth remembering\nthat these people may receive a very substantial commission from\nyour policy, depending on the type you choose. On a whole life policy\ncosting \u00a320 a month this could be \u00a3144 the first year, \u00a372 the second\nyear and then \u00a36 a year for the next 18 years, whereas on shorter-term policies (where the tax subsidy still applies) commission may be\nas low as \u00a310.\nInsurance salesman must also abide by various legal requirements\nand certain codes of practice drawn up by their trade associations, at\nrisk at losing their agency. The most important of these is their duty\nto ensure that you understand the long-term nature of such a policy\nand what will happen if you stop it before the agreed term. The ten-day cooling-off period must also be clearly indicated, in writing; this\nmay be done by letter after you have agreed to take on a policy which\nin effect gives you longer than ten days from the original decision.\nOther codes of practice require salesmen to call at a reasonable time,\nor by appointment, to tell you which company or companies they\nrepresent, and not to make unfair criticisms of other insurers.\nIf you have already accepted a policy which you are not happy\nabout and feel that you were inadequately informed by the salesman\nit could still be possible to wriggle out of it without any loss of\npremiums. The Student Services Office may be able to assist in this\nFor anyone else considering such policies: if in dou bf don't! Sue Telling\nH.G.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nRag Mag Banned\nNo to NUS!\nA motion banning this year's ICU Rag Mag was passed and\none proposing a referendum and re-affiliation to the NUS\ndefeated at Tuesday's UGM. The meeting opened at 1:03pm in\na fairly packed Great Hall.\nFollowing the U GM Chairman' s example we shall say\nthat items1 to5 on the agenda almost passed without elaboration because those concerned just referred to\nExec News( where items 1 to 5\nwere to be found); no quest ions were asked and the reports passed.\nHowever, President Nick Morton added that something concrete should emerge from the IC/Q EC talks soon (per-hap s the IQ College) and urged the members to support\nthe Association of University Teachers' Day of Action on November18. Barney McCabe couldn't even include a report in Exec News and was asked no questions, although because\nMike was present his current report (!) and the one referred\nback from the previous U GM were accepted.\nChris Webb( Man Sci) and Martin Bellamy/ Tony Sym mons ( DoC) were ratified as\nDc pReps and the following posts were also ratified: AP Editor Dave Rowe; Publicity Officer Rich Archer; Ents Officer Simon Shaw;2 ord in ary members of ICCA G Ruth Moses and Jane Camp bell; FELIX Business Manager Caroline God in; Academic Affairs Ct tee ordinary member Neil Martin. There were no other candidates lor\nordinary members of the Academic Affairs Committee. Elections were held for four\nmembers of the Permanent Working Party and two members of Union Finance Committee. A procedural motion was\npassed which moved NUS President Dave Aaron ov itch' s speech until after the motion on a proposed referendum. Bill D uro die then outlined financial reasons for selling the Rag Mag. After a vote to allow the\namendment banning sale to\nreplace the original motion to\nsell the maga card vote was held and the amended motion passed. The mag will now be withdrawn from sale.\nA motion to hold a referendum on whether or not lo re-affiliate to NUS was proposed\nby J. Stanley, opposed by N. Morton and defeated on a vote.\nDavid Aaron ov itch then gave a forceful speech mostly\non what the NUS has achieved and hopes to achieve( although most of his figures\nhave appeared in FELIX several times this year) rather than saying that ICU should join. Although be was rather' surly' at the start he should be given credit for patience,\nhis delivery and sticking to\nthe point.\nThe meeting adjourned at\n2 : 2 4 pm. Dave Aaronovitch, NUS President, addressed the UGM on Tuesday.\nSticking their oars in\nThe non shit flinging part of Morphy Day went as follows:\nLowry Eights (mens novice): 1st Guilds,2 nd Mines,3 rd RCS. Ladies Fours: 1st Mines,2 nd RCS,3 rd Guilds. Rugger Eights: 1st Guilds,2 nd Mines,3 rd RCS. Morphy Eights (senior men): 1st Mines,2 nd Guilds,3 rd RCS. After sell o taping their boat back together to make it\nwaterproof, the Guilds Lowry Eight were late at the start, but\nwent on to win easily with RCS trailing in third place at the\nfinish.\nThe starting line of the Ladies Race was moved in order to\navoid an oil tanker(?) anchored in the middle of the river. After a closely contested race the Mines crew repeated last years\nvictory. The Rug ger Eights drifted for the greater part of the course,\nbeing unable to line up correctly until opposite the boat house. The eventual winners were Guilds after a close race.\nThere was an exciting finish to the Morphy Race; Mines and Guilds were neck and neck until Guilds stroke man lost his oar due to a faulty gate. Mines went on to win. RCS upheld an ancient tradition by coming last again!( Except lor the ladies!)\nThere is some dispute over the towpath goings-on. Guilds claim that they won the Morphy Oar by pulling it over a previously designated ' line', but then allowed Mines to retake it.\nWhereupon the Miners put it in their vanand drove away. Stop Press!\nOn Thursday the College branch of the ASTM S passed a resolution supporting\na national directive with regard to redundancies. They feel that it has become\nobvious that the current cuts in Government expenditure, coupled with the\ninternal priorities of the Rector, will result in many redundancies next year and\nsubsequent industrial action on their par*. They hope to be joined b v the\nCollege ACT, NAL GO, and N UP E members on a rally and lobby next\nWednesday afternoon. Any students wishing to join them will be welcome.\nFurther information on the meeting at College next Wednesday will be\nadvertised soon.\nNo. 596 Friday, November 13,1981 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "Jo witt's second home\nPotential student accommodation in Southside is being left\nvacant because of a strange sense of priorities on the part of the\nStudents Residents' Committee, headed by Dr Don Mon ro. The retirement of Simon Perry( ex Selkirk Warden) and Frank Potter( ex Keo gh Warden) has made available this new accommodation, which consists ol two luxury, three bedroomed penthouse flats, each providing places for four students, at a suggested rent of about \u00a3100 per flat.\nDr Paul Jo witt( Falmouth/ Keo gh) has decided that he wants to move into one of the flats since it is larger than the one he lives\nin now. However Jo witt has insisted that the flat be renovated before he and his family move in. Until the Jo witt s do move in, their flat will not be available to let to -students.\nAs if this delay isn't enough, neither flat will be offered to\nstudents until the beginning of next term at the earliest, in spite\nof the fact that no conversion of the flats needs to be undertaken. The only excuse given for this delay is that the surveyor for\nHalls and Houses has left College and if he is not replaced, a further delay will result.\nAs usual, rents for College accommodation will be reviewed in January. Is it, therefore just a coincidence that the\" completion\" date for the two flats also happens to be January? Mon ro has expressed a belief that \" FELIX isn't really into making constructive remarks.\" The points being made are: in view of the present need for\nexpenditure cuts; why does Jo witt' s flat have to be redecorated at all? Why can't Jo witt live in the flat while re decoration is in progress? Why leave two flats vacant, when they could be\nearning extra rents for College( amounting to at least \u00a3200 per\nweek)?\nMost importantly, what is the priority of the Student Residents' Committee? It is obviously not the provision of\nCollege accommodation for the use of students \u2014 a contradiction in terms?\nFELIX may well be accused ol not really being\" into making constructive remarks\" \u2014 if the above comments can in anyway be seen as unconstructive That \"awfully embarrassing\nrefectory flat\"\nSo, that \" awfully embarrassing refectory Hat\" in the Union Building( pictured below) is \" designated for refectory staff who work un social hours\", according to College Secretary, John Smith( see letters page). This UGM: FELIX Comment\nAt the UGM last Tuesday two important issues\nconcerning ICU were discussed, namely whether ICU\nshould re-affiliate to the NUS and also whether the\ncontroversial Rag Mag should go on sale.\nAs for the Rag Mag,a very active discussion took place\nconcerning the contents of this Union publication. Andy Rush ton( Guilds President) delivered a well received statement\non the subject, stating that there was no point in producing a magazine primarily designed at collecting money for disabled people when that very same magazine 'took the piss out of them'. It was very clear that Mr Rush ton had captured the crux of the\nissue since the ensuing vote was in favour of stopping the sale of\nthe Mag. As for the question of ICU's status with respect to the NUS,a debate took place in which Nick Morton opposed the motion of\njoining and a somewhat feeble speaker spoke in favour.\nIt was evident that the consensus of opinion in the audience was on Nick's side. He was very clear to point out that the\nextraction of money from other areas of the Union's activities\nnamely, clubs and societies, as well as the Student Services was\ncertainly a price that ICU was not prepared to pay for joining a\" largely ineffectual organisation\". In this respect FELIX stands\nwith Nick in that we cannot give any kind of support for mpv es towards area f lili ation of ICU with NUS. Having said this-we would also like to point out that we are\ncertainly not impressed at the way the NUS issue was discussed.\nIt is recognised that Mr Aaron ov itch did not come to speak\non the motion( and also that he is a Com mie). However it was\ndefinitely quite rude of the meeting not to allow Mr Aaron ov itch to speak before the motion. In fact, he should have\nbeen allowed to in form the audience about the activities of the\nNUS, what it stands for, etc., before the motion concerning the\nproposed referendum. We also believe that Nick( Action Man) Morton should have spoken out strongly in favour of letting Aaron ov itch speak his case at the appropriate time.\nwould not seem to be what it\nis actually used for if the people who regularly enter it\nare anything to go by.\nFor the past few months those members of the refectory\nstaff who have been seen using the flat have normally been\naccompanied by an array of\nyoung ladies. It seems that the\nflat is more of a\" knocking shop\" used, presumably, to\navoid wives and girlfriends rather than because of un sociable hours.\nIndeed, at the end of the\nsummer holiday when the flat\nwas genuinely required by a temporary worker in the refectory, it was revealed that\nDomestic Secretary, Captain Lindley had the key and the\nflat was not available. Captain Lindley can hardly be desc ribe d as \" refectory stall\" and certainly is not required to\nwork unsociable hours.\nThe fact remains that there\nare two flats in the Union Building which remain empty for long periods and have dubious usage at present. They could( and should) be\nused for a better purpose or at\nleast redecorated and used for\ntheir stated purpose. Surely the College should not provide \"free hotel room\" for \" needy\" couples?\nBrandt Report\nMr Qu lu budd in Aziz, Mini ster of Information( Embassy of Pakistan) came to IC two\nweeks ago to address students\non the Brandt Commission's Report. The Report concerns\nthe responsibility of the Rich North towards the Poorer' South. In short Mr Aziz typified a Western career diplomat in his very feeble ad vocation of\nthe Report. Despite a question concerning the fact that Mr Heath( who was intimately involved with the preparation of the report) had condemned the recent meeting in Kanko on of the rich and poor country leaders as a complete waste ol '\nopportunity, Mr Aziz simply stated that he considered the\nmeeting as a movement forward and everyone was\nentitled to his own opinion. Although Mr Aziz presented his talk very eloquently his argument was very bland and superficial. FELIX, November 13, 1981 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "8.8. Wotflf\ne's Va Slack 8o ok It appears that there's some confusion\nover exactly what I write about. People\nseem to think that I make up stories-not\nso. Every/thing included is based on actual\nevents, even if I embroider a little for\nadded effect. Donations still generously\nreceived, although in-jokes and other\nsuch rubbish will be ritually burnt.\nJust good friends\nLazy Deputy President, Barney McCabe, has\nissued a challenge to me to give any\ndocumentary evidence that he lived at 1\nWharfedale St. last year. Of course, I should\nhave explained that Barney was not a rent\npaying resident, merely a freeloading vagrant\nwho always slept there. The landlord, no\ndoubt, was unaware of the extra inhabitant.\nHe claims that last year he lived in a Streatham room in Wavertree Road: true, that\nis the address which he shared with RC SUV P Phil Green street and from where he and several other people (who were actually living\nin Earls Court) claimed fic it io us travelling\nexpenses from their LEAs. Oh yes, and if there were five men claiming\nto live in the Streatham room, how come it\nonly has one double bed? Mr McCabe and Co are obviously very good \"friends\".\nBaron's Books\nBaron Flowers of Queensgate in the City of\nWestminster, Rector of Imperial College (Bri)\nis indeed a man of the world. Why only the\nother day, while browsing through his well-laden bookshelf, I discovered a marvellous\nbook on social sciences entitled\" The Professionals\u2014An in-depth study of pros-t it ute s, their lives and clients\".\nBut on the shelf of his wife Mary, the\neffervescent first lady of IC, I found a real gem:\n\" How to Live with a Neurotic Husband\". Well\nthere's a turn up for the books!\nFlaming success\nHaving mentioned Lady Flowers I must\nrelate the story of her performance at a recent\nGuilds dinner.\nAfter the meal, some blindfolded clown or\nother was performing magic tricks to amuse\nthe new intake and help them forget the\ninevitable indigestion which grips you after one\nof Victor Mooney's delightful dishes. Anyway,\nhe handed an envelope to her ladyship and\nasked her to burn it. Lady F( obviously in a bit\nof a flap h avn g not donned the normal sequined leotard of a magician'sass it ant) didn't do what you or I might and catch one\ncorner alight in the candle flame. Instead she\nthrust the envelope directly above the candle,\nwhich caught fire in the middle and burnt\nrapidly outward towards her fingers. Being a smart old coot she then dropped the flaming\nmass....onto the paper tablecloth. Meanwhile\nthe blindfolded magician was getting a little\nsuspicious as he could smell burning and heard\nthe clattering of people beating back the\nflames.\nThe moral of the story? You may be able to\ntake a horse to water, but you can't necessarily teach it new tricks.\nSilly; Secretaries\nIt has always been a constant source of\namazement to me that secretaries are so\nwilling to lie about the whereabouts of their\nbosses. The Editor assures me that most of\nCollege block are either \"in meetings\" or \"at\nlunch\" for ninety-five per cent of their day, if\nwe believe their secretaries. Particularly bad\nwere the hags who work for Refectory Manager Mr Mooney and Bookings Manager\nMr Schaffner, whose aim would seem to keep\ntheir bosses as rested as possible and be very\nobstructive to any callers.\nAnyway a more amusing incident occurred\nthe other week when the Chairman of the\nOrchestra telephoned the Sil wood Park\nWarden about the annual orchestra weekend\nat the field station.\n\"He's in a meeting\" she was told at first, but\nafter explaining her enquiry the secretary\nmelted: \" Oh, I 'll go and see if he's really at a meeting then\".\nRubber reminder\nMy good friend Arnold Sc rote, Union dustman and well-known socialite, passed me\nthe following memorandum from Nick Morton's bin the other day. It is nice to see\noffice practice extended to debts of honour.\nQuotes\n\"If I don't get any action on the education cuts\nby Christmas, I 'll resign,\" Nick Morton, ICU President.\n\" This Executive will take some beating,\"\nBarney McCabe, ICU Deputy President.\n\" Are you taping this?\" Captain Lindley, Domestic Secretary (to FELIX Editor).\n\"There are going to be some drastic changes in\nthe refectories before Christmas,\" Nick Morton at first U GM of term.\n\" He was even more boring than I am,\" Martin\nTaylor, E AO( about David Owen).\n\"Consoc are having a big go at IF. Trying to\nstick ourselves in there,\" Tim Lawes, Consoc.\nBroken vow\nGuilds President Andy Rushton vowed not to\ndrink too much on the lunchtime before the\nCivil Engineering Freshers' Dinner, despite the\nfact that it was his initiation into the Links Club\n(a sort of boozy ex patriots association).\nHis resolve soon broke and he began to swill\nback rum and blacks like there was no\ntomorrow. Before long he leapt up on the bar\nand (being 6ft6 in with the roof only 6ft above\nthe bar) began to lose his balance. With a sideways fall he connected with a wooden\nbench and was rushed, bleeding, to the Health\nCentre.\nHere he remained for three hours and could\nnot remember being very concerned how Dr\nAddenbroke was putting in his three stitches.\nHe kept wanting to know whether she was\n\"putting the knots in properly\".\nStill in a state of semi-consciousness he was\ntaken to St Stephens Hospital in the IC\nambulance and came around on the way. He\nwas released from hospital at 10:30am the next\nday.\nIt would have been quite amusing to take\nhim along to the dinner anyway\u2014he would\nhave been much quieter than usual and could\nhave laye d, spark out on the table along with\nSpanner and bolt.\nPage 8 FELIX, November 13, 1981\n\n"
