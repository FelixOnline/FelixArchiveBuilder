This particular report was the Government's long awaited formal response to the'\noriginal report, taking the form Of a White Paper. On the outset it seems very\npro missing; gone are the demands for\nloan financed postgraduate funding (for\nthe time being); gone are the demands\nof previous reports for central funding\nand control of postgraduate training; gone\nare the assertions that manpower planning\nshould be the sole governing factor (now\nrelegated to being merely the overriding\nfactor).\nHowever, on removing all this, one\nis merely left with a tacit ad vocation of\nthe status quo with a few un savoury overtones.\nApprenticeship to a career\nin scholarship\nThe paper does recognise that personal\nsatisfaction and the contribution made\nby research students to the advancement\nICWA\nWe are now over our first major hurdle\nof the term \u2014 the Annual Freshers\nD 'nner. Despite the long delay \u2014 the\nport had gone astray \u2014 the meal went\ndown very well( pun!!). All in all people\nseemed to enjoy the whole evening.\nMany thanks to all who helped in any\nway to make the whole evening so successful. Discos\nOn Sat 30th Oct there shou id be the\nfirst in the series of ICWA Discos. The disco will be held in the Union from\n8pm \u2014 midnight and entrance is FREE. Thereafter every second Saturday there\nwill be a disco but. the charge will be a mere 10p. Practical matters\nNow for a few practical details about\nICWA. We are the proud owner of three\nsewing machines. These can be borrowed\nby any young lady for a nominal sum for anything up to two weeks. If the\nmachine takes longer to return home then\nthere is a fine imposed. So if you want to\nmend your jeans or start your dress for\nthe ICWA Ball then you can borrow one\nof the machines from Rm 98 Beit Hall. Also if you live in Beit then you can borrow a hair dryer. The only condition\non borrowing this is that it is returned\nthe same day \u2014 hence it really only\napplies to people in residence.1\nElections once more Now that you know what ICWA can do for you, why don't you do something for\nICWA. In the near future nomination\npapers will be going up for the posts of\nHon Sec, Treasurer, Ents Officer,\nBiology Rep and Mines Rep. If you are\nInterested in helping or criticizing in\nany way then please stand for one of\nthese posts. The only way we know what\nyou want done is if you tell us and this\nis your chance.\nIsobel Donnelly\nPresident\nof knowledge, are important factors.\nFurther more it recognises, that \u2022 an\nexact fit to the social and economic\ndemands of the society are impossible\nand that we must settle for a very 'loose\nfit'. However it goes on to say that a system designed for individual demands\nwould be a very haphazard way of\nsatisfying manpower needs. At last,\nthankfully, the Government recognises\nthat a PhD is not a piece of abstract\nresearch, but is,' an apprenticeship to a future career in scholarship', and notes\nthe application of this to a wide variety\nof future vocations. The Government appa rant ly believes\nthat the content and balance of PG training are too complex for central\ncontrol, and is content to exercise\nsuch control only over the overall scale\nand development.\nFinance: Central control out\nOn the finance side again, central\ncontrol is out, but the award making bodies should control both the numbers\nand distribution of PG s throughout the\nsubject range. It is appa rant that the\nGovernment is seeking to increase its\ncontrol, through these bodies, by ensuring\nthat more PG s are dependant on them for\nfunding. The recent and proposed fee\nincreases are shown to be just one small\npart of this plan and are shown clearly\nfrom the report to be an attack on the\nThis week's article is supposed to be\na short summary of the political groups\nwithin student politics, but | must stress\nthat it is only a personal view and may\nappear to some of you to be biased and\ninaccurate - if you do feel this way let\nthe editor know, he' s desperate for\ncontroversy.\nStarting from the left we have the\nrevolutionary socialist parties such as the International Marxist Group (IMG) and\nthe Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP).\nThese groups are essentially revolutionary but each preach their own particular\nbrand of revolution. The WR Pisa very\ninteresting party, their obsession is to\noverthrow the Labour Government (no\nalternative stated); this theme occurs so often in their speeches that it has been\nsuggested frivolously that they are\nfinanced by the Tory party.. All these\ngroups are small but consist of very\nactive members, so that they often\nattract a disproportionate amount of\nattention.\nMoving to the right we come to a very\nlarge, in terms of NUS conference\ndelegates the second largest group, and\nwell organised group \u2014 the International\nSocialists organised into the National\nOrganisation ot International Socialist\nSocieties, abbreviated to NOISS (pro-noun ced noise). They are a basically Trotskyite party, that is ner>c pm munis t and have very strong support in many\nPolytechnics( except Strand).\nSlightly to the right again are ICU's' be te noir' the Broad Left \u2014 a mixture of\nCommunist, left wing Labour and non13.5% of PG s at present self-financed.\nThere are also vague references to a change in structure of PG awards as a further step in increasing this control.\nThe present Research Council funding\nscheme is upheld for the time being on\nthe grounds of minim ising bureaucracy.\nOn the whole the report is disappointing\nand possibly dangerous in its support\nfor the increased fees and the status quo\nin PG Education. The recommendations\nare inane and innocuous but the undertones\nin the body of the report are disturbing. It\nis hoped that the NUS's own report on PG education will contribute to what the\nWhitepaper calls, 'far-reaching public\ndebate' ,both by countering these undertones\nand by making some positive and constructive suggestions for the PG of\ntomorrow rather than leaving him to sink further into the present bog of be u roc racy. ill\nRC SELECTION for Honorary\nJunior Treasurer on Monday 25th October.

Their are three small parties in this .\nspace, firstly the Union of Liberal\nStudents a group which is very much to\nthe left of the Parliamentary party and\nconsequently is in a state of political\nbankruptcy. There are also the Students\nfor Representative Policies, a small party\ndedicated to changing the structure of the\nNUS and bringing in more representative\npolicies. Despite it's small size it is well financed and well publicised. Similar in aims but even smaller is the\nSocial Democratic Party.\nFinalfy we come to the Federation Of\nConservative Students (FCS) - politically\nslightly more moderate than the Tory\nparty but since they are financed by it,\nstill in agreement with most of their\npolicies. The FCS is the third largest\ngroup at NUS conference after the Broad\nLeft and NOISS. It has grown from very\nsmall beginnings to its present size in\nthe last couple of years \u2014 its main areas\nof support are the big Universities.

    "content": "12 - FELIX, OCTOBER21 MI.\nTHE LSO DEBATE\nAt a forthcoming UGM IC Union will decide whether to remain within the London Students Organisation. To help\nelucidate the debate FELIX asked Hugh Barrett and Trevor Phillips to present the pros & cons of staying in LSO.\nThere are several good\nreasons for not re-affiliating\nto the London Students\nOrganisation and I will briefly\nrun through a few of the more\nimportant ones:\nFinance\nThe main reason is purely\nfinancial \u2014 Imperial College Union is in a very tight\nfinancial position after having\nits grant from the Governers\nincreased by only 10% last\nyear \u2014 which represents a dec f ease in real money terms.\nICU has thus been forced to\nreduce subsidies and, in some\ncases, curtail activities\n\u2022 completely.\nICU is due to pay \u00a3500\n\u20223 to LSO this year in affiliation\nfees; that might not seem an\nexcessive amount when set\nagainst \u00a380,000 - ICU's income\nfrom the Governors \u2014 but a large percentage the Union's grant goes on fixed expenditure\nsuch as maintain ance of union\nareas, sabbatical and office\nstaff salaries etc, so the \u00a3500\nis reducing the activity of the\nunion by a substantial amount\n\u2014 it would for example keep\nFELIX going for half a year\nor take 100 sports people out\nto Harlington and back every\nSaturday for a term.\nit doesn't cost us anything as a union. UL U Students\nRepresentative Council is the\nPolitical side of UL U and\nperfectly able to run campaigns\non issues that effect all the colleges within the\nUniversity.\nHow about at National\nlevel - isn't that what NUS\nis for? We all ready pay \u00a3400\nto NUS every year and one of\nthe things we expect (and get)\nin return are national campaigns\non national issues such as\nstudent grants, housing,\noverseas students etc.\nSabbatical career prospects\nFfhally one of the main\ncriticisms leveled at LSO over\nthe past two years is that it\nprovides a comfortable\nsabbatical year for an up and\ncoming NUS politico. Last\nyear it was John Webster\n(ex-NUS vice-president) and\nthis year it's our very own\nTrevor Phillips( ex-ICU\nsabbatical President, e xUL U sabbatical President,\npresent LSO sabbatical\nsecretary, next year NUS sabbatical ? Fill in your\nanswer and send it on a postcard to: Broad Left c/oN US, Endsleigh St). The one\nargument in favour of LSO that\nWe're already in the\ncheaper alternatives,\nso why bother\nwith LSO\nSo we pay \u00a3500 of our\nincreasingly scarce cash to\nLSO every year and what do we\nget in return?\nULU cheaper and\nmore effective\nWe are supposed to get\ncampaigns run on a local\nbasis but, as far as I can see,. LSO is failing in this job and\nI'm not the only one who feels\nthis way. To quote Pete Phillips( no relation) who was last\nyears LSO Western Area\nConvener '...the sheer size of\nLSO itself prevents any real\nlocal action...' So even aLSO officer agrees that LSO is not\nproviding any significant\ncampaigns at a local level \u2014\ncampaigns which could be run\njust as easily and mud h more\nefficiently by a large college\nsuch asIC. With LSO failing\nto provide real local action' what about an all London \u2022level?As far as IC is concerned\na well established and fairly\nwell run organisation already\nexists - the University of\nLondon Union ( UL U). This has the added advantage that\nI have any time for is that it\nenables small colleges to share\nin the resources of larger\ncolleges. This is a good point\nbut I feel that it is better\norganised on a far more local\n\u2014 for us S Kensington area \u2014\nand informal basis.. Hugh Barrett,\nExternal Affairs Officer\nTHE LSO DEBATE IC UNION GENERAL\nMEETING\nGREAT HALL\nThurs. 2nd Dec. 1pm The Editor welcomes\ncorrespondence on\nthis topic\nLSO-the reasons\nwhy ICU needs\nto stay in\nThere are two questions\nto be answered in this brief\narticle. Firstly, what is the\nLondon Students' Organisation?\nSecondly, what can it do for\nstudents?\nTake the first question first.\nOver the past few years, it has\nbeen widely- recognised that\nNUS,a s a national body of\n700,000 students could not\nhope to handle all the issues\nthat affected students locally,\nor of organising campaigns or\nservices locally, thus the\n54 NUS areas, based on towns\nand counties developed,\nshould provide a smaller,\nlocal focus for students.\nFirst year of existence\nLSO is the area organisation\nrecognized by (but independant\nof) NUS National Conference.\nThere are over 160 colleges in\nLondon, and last year, in its\nfirst year of existence, about\n105 joined LSO. The ones who\ndid .not were mainly small\ncolleges with no function in\nUnions, to which LSO is\nextending services anyway.\nA few others wanted to wait and\nsee what .happened to LSO. This\nyear some have already joined\n(Kingston Polytechnic for\ninstance) and others are on the\nverge of doing so.\"\nNeed for all-round London body For some years, it has\nbeen widely recognised that\nLondon students collectively can have a massive influence\non NUS, and on local educational. bodies. There are 120,000\nfull-time students in London,\nand a quarter of a million\npart-times. However, beyond\nUL U, U LIES A( the student\nteachers organisation), there\nwas no all-London body.\nPrevious attempts had failed\neither because they were\nunco-ordinated, or else built\nup bureaucratic structures\nwith no relation to student\nneeds, and provided havens\nfor aging Student Union hack s.ULU' and U LIES A were\nlimited in their roles. So 2\nyears ago . the process of\nbuilding the LSO was started,\nand the LSO itself car ft e into\nbeing in May 1975.\nSince then LSO has begun\nto develop the kind of\norganisation that can defend,\nin advance, students' interests.\nWith the weight of London's massive concentration of\nstudents, the largest in\nEurope, we can hope to have\nan influence on questions of\ngrants, housing, welfare and\nservices for students.\nWhat LSO does\nLSO itself has provided\ninformation and research\nmaterial on many of the issues affecting students: cuts, overseas students, and the rio using manual, for instance. Posters\nand broadsheets have been\nproduced. Last year, plans\nto cut the number of overseas\nstudents in London were\ndefeated by campaign co ordinating by the LSO. Not\nleast, LSO has been responsible\nfor producing the new London\nStudent Handbook.\nIn services, LSO, is hoping\nto convene meetings for\nwelfare, entertainments and\nsports officers to exchange\ninformation, ideas and to\ndevelop the effectiveness of\nlocal Student Union Officers,\nroles and services. Representation\nIn ter rps of campaigning,\nwe are .now seeking to gain\nrepresentation on educational\nbodies in London, and are on\nthe verge of a breakthrough\nwith the largest, the Inner\nLondon Education Authority.\nWhy ICU needs LSO\nThe LSO operates largely\nthrough its sub areas. Imperial\nfalls in the west area in which\ncontext it can play a role in\nrelating LSO' s activities even\nmore directly to the needs of\nIC's students. It can also\nhelp in the vital task of\nbui.lding smaller and weaker\nStudent Unions in the locality.\nMost Students Unions in\nLondon have recognized the\nimportance of uniting and\nworking together for the good\nof students. No Student Union\nin London can afford to stand\noutside this process. The way\nthat LSO works, campaigns and\nprovides services is for those\nUnions to decide through the\nLSO conference \u2014 but they\nmust take part in decision making if they are to do their\njobs. As an ex-member of\nICU I hope that IC's students\naccept trie responsibility and\ntake the decision to play an\nactive part in the London\nStudents Organisation.\nTrevor Phillips Secretary LSO "

After all, politicians in this country\nare elected democratically\n(despite the need for electoral\nreform) and they span the whole\npolitical spectrum from Left to\nRight. The politicians are\nin a far better position than\nany IC student to adopt a global perspective on foreign\naffairs \u2014 so let us leave it up\nto them for a change. For an\nIC Union Meeting to adopt a positive stance on a particular\nforeign issue may appear very\ngrandiose. But I consider it\nto be irrelevant.\nSo the questions of Rhodesia and South Africa are important,\nI agree. And I can read all about them in the national\npress thank you very much,\ninternational issues are\nimportant, but discussion of\nthem at an IC Union Meeting is\nnot!!\nAnother thing is this: when\nSoc Soc scurry about calling a recent U GM amendment\n' vicious', the intemperance of\ntheir language cuts them off\nfrom a large majority of IC students.

That is a dangerous practice which\nstarkly silhouettes Soc Soc as\na group of well-intention ed but naive dilettantes.\nOne of Soc Soc's warhorses\nis the altitude that racists and fascists must be 'stamped\nout'.

    "content": "THE BENEFITS OF THE NATIONAL STUDENT\nFor the last umpteen years the National Union of\nStudents has been fighting for higher student grants. Their\nindifferent success here has led them to investigate.other\nways of extending your grant.\nHence the National Discount Scheme which, amid the\nusual mass of publicity, made its entrance less than two\nmonths ago. Once you have purchased the discount card\nyou are entitled to the full range of discounts listed in the\naccompanying handbook (which comes with the \u00a3 2 you pay\nfor the card). These usually amount to 10% and do not\nnormally apply to items which have already been reduced\nby the retailer.\nBeing the first year of operation NUS Marketing has not secured too many discounts. The scheme is heavily\nreliant on the Countdown discount card, printed on the\nstudent discount card, and its discounts. Considering the\nCountdown card usually costs \u00a3 7 . 5 0 , its addition to NSDS\nis a great boom.\nFELIX has tried to list the range of discounts available\nin and around IC. Discounts available in Chelsea, Earls Court and Knightsbridge are also listed. This guide is certainly not exclusive and retailers or restaurants outside\nthe student budget have been deliberately excluded.\nFull details of all discounts are available in the NSDS\nHandbook. FELIX is indebted to NUS, NUS Marketing and\nCountdown for permission to publish this guide.\nDiscount is 10% on all\nproducts at the retailers\nlisted unless otherwise\nstated.\n1\n^\n1 ei\nNUS discounts\nNational discounts negotiated exclusively tar the NSDS\nW.H.

    "content": "1976 FELIX, OCTOBER21 st 1976 - 13\nFELIX SPORT\nPolo team waddle their\nway to success\nThe IC Water-polo' team has\nmade a further step towards\nthe Middlesex league water-polo\nfirst division championship,\nwith a sensational 11\u20145\nvictory over Penguin. Despite\nthe weakening of the team, due\nto the absence of the ' Animal' and Andy Smith, this was indeed one of the finest ever\nperformances by the IC team.\nIn fact it was only last year\nthat we were promoted after\nwinning the second division, and we now require only one\nfurther point to clinch the\ntitle.\nKo staR i bar had flown in from Abu Dhabi especially for\nthis critical match and started\noff playing in goal. We were\nglad of his presence, as the\nexperienced Penguin attack\npeppered the IC goal with shots\nThe IC defense however stuck\ntogether, and the Penguin players began shooting wildly from too far out. Kos ta, using\nhis vast experience plucked\nthese long shots out of the\nair easily, and fed the ball out\nto the IC players.\nThe first goal came from a long pass to Cliff Spooner\nwho was playing in the 'sitting\nforward' position. The referee\nwasn't giving' very much\naway, and after a bit of a wrestling match, the yellow water-polo ball eventually\nfound its way into the corner\nof the net. This was a remarkable feat for Cliff, whose hand\nflicked the ball in; as his head was three feet below\nthe water, and the degree of\ncontortion involved for this\nman ou vre would have done\njustice to any Yoga student.\nHis' bad leg' seems to have\nmended.\nGood defensive work by\nDave Lowther usual game\ngave Penguin no breathing\nspace at all, and gave ICa20 lead at the start of the\nsecond quarter.\nBrutality\nPenguin, however, were\nno pushover and they came\nback strongly at the start .of\nthe second quarter to level the\nscore. IC quickly replied with\nthree quick goals, one each\nfrom the two McCartneys and one from Paul Hindle. Soon\nafter one of the Penguin\nplayers was ordered out for\nbrutality; Rory Lewis then\npro ceded to score from a 'man-up' position. This put IC\nfour clear at half time.\nFor the rest of ^the match\nIain Bales came into play in\ngoal and Kosta played out. Although very experienced,\nthe Penguin team were not\nquite as fit asus, and relentless IC pressure proved too\nmuch for some of them, who began to tire.\nHat-trick\nMichael McCartney finished\noff his hat-trick and Peter McCartney got one of his typical flukey goals, from a long-shot. Penguin, however,\npenetrated the IC defense\nquickly with two long shots in reply; the score was thus\n9 - 4 at the end of the third\nquarter.\nThe match was rounded off\nwith a goal each from Cliff and Paul, and a consolation\ngoal near the end to Penguin. By that time the IC team were\nsetting their sights on the\nnext match in the championship,\nat which they hope to clinch the title.\nThe club meets Mondays\nand Fridays7 \u20140pm, in the\nsports centre, just bring your\ntogs and turn up.\nX Country\nTraining: vital for a good season\nThere are two short words\nwhich strike terror into the\nlegs of the members of IC Xcountry club \u2014 ' Par ly Hill'. These refer to Parliament Hill Fields on the southern part of\nHamstead Heath. The first\nSaturday of the term saw the\nfirst of seven races to be held\nthere, University of London\n( U L)vs Blackheath. This incorporated the UL trial.\nIC turned out in force with\nboth refreshed stalwarts and exuberant fresher s. The field of forty seven\nincluded two young ladies, who whilst surviving only\nhalf of the 5V2 miles, led over\nhalf the IC team. Conditions\nfor the race were perfect and\ntimes' were fast considering\nthis was the first race of the\nseason. Dave Rosen ran well to finish 5thin the creditable\ntime of29 mins20 secs, Paul Clarke was next in, coming 9th with the new Andy Davey\nfollowing in a disappointing 19th. The following Wednesday,\nIC entertained a number of\nLADIES ROWING For the first two Wednesdays\nof term an enthusiastic group\nof ladies gathered down at\nat Putney to start the rowing\nyear. With both Morphy Day and aUL regatta this term, the\nclub aims to get as many\nladies as possible rowing\nsoon.\nNew members received\nbasic coaching from experienced\noarsmen both on a rowing\ntank and on the river; and\neverybody seemed to enjoy\nthis. Once again prospective\nmembers seem to be predominantly Scientists, Mines being\ncompletely unrepresented\nRS M where are you?\nWhere are you RSM? Come to\nPutney and learn to row, if\nonly for Morphy Day. We're\nsure you'll love rowing!\nThe club meets at the\nboat house on Saturday at\n10.00am or on Wednesday\nunder the Quuens Tower at\n1.00pm, Further details from Sue\nSmith (capt) Maths III or Sue\nJames (vice capt) Ph ys II L colleges on our home course\nat Petersham. Again, considering the early stage of the\nseason, times were fast \u2014 as were the opposition's. Paul Clarke (although on this\noccasion beating Dave Rosen)\ncould only finish6 thin a personal best of 29mins21 sees. Dave was not far behind in8 th overall. IC finished in 3rd place out of six*\nLADIES HOCKEY\nGood friendly\ndespite result\nIC Ladies Hockey started\nthe season fairly successfully with a friendly match against\nMiddlesex Hospital. Although we narrowly lost\nthe game, the team performance was encouraging, as it\nwas the first time that many of\nthem had played together.\nPlay in the first half was evenly matched and the score\nat half time was2 \u20142. At the\nstart of the second half IC suffered a bad patch and Middlesex scored 3 fairly\nqu cik goals. But we recovered\nagain to add two more goals to\nour score and finish 5\u20144 down.\nThe IC goals were scored by\nKathy Snook (2) Diana\nMounsey and Janet Cox age, with several other people\nputting up good performances.\nTeam:- Lucy Vella, Rosalind\nBaker, Lorraine Couchman,\nChristine Forsyth, Debra Bean,\nKaren Pollack, Carol Fraser,\nJanet Coxage (capt) Diana\nMounsey, Kathy Snook, Elaine\nHammersely.\nC FORSYTH MIXED HOCKEY:\nPASSING CHANGE\nREVIVES IC\nCONFIDENCE\nWestfield vIC\nImperial College Mixed Hockey Team got the season off to a fine.start with a2 \u20141\nvictory over Westfield College. However it was Westfield who took the initiative early on, when the IC defense was caught in* a mess and allowed\nthe Westfield forwards through\nto score.\nAfter this initial lapse IC began to get on top, as passing became more accurate. This brought both increased confidence and the equalizer, a fine\nindividual effort by Tim Marshall. He also had a hand\nin the second goal, drawing the\ngoal-keeper out before passing the ball to Tariq Sethin, who had no difficulty putting it\naway.\nThe second half was end-to-end stuff, with some fine\ngoal-keeping by Roger Hutson\nthat kept the opposition out in the frantic last ten minutes.\nTeam: Roger Hutson; John\nHuckle; Kim Houlden; Chris\nForsyth; Debra Bean; John\nSpear; Janet Coxage; Tariq\nSeth in;C has Hardy; Jim Mars hall\nJane Masters.\nFresher gains\nOn Wednesday 13th October,\nthe Orienteering Club travelled\nto Richmond Park for a small beginners' event. The long\ncourse of7 Vi Kilometres\nattracted only a few entrants\nas most people preferred the\nshorter version.\nFresher success\nAndy Q utc k fall and Mark\nEvans, both fresher s, did well to complete the long course in53 mins20 secs and 66mins lOse cs respectively. Andy is a very welcome addition\nto the IC Orienteering scene, as he has been orienteering\nfor several years now.\nCheating rules OK!\nOn the short course, Keith Sugden was the easy winner,\nfive minutes clear of France sLum b from Royal Holloway. The rest of the IC contingent\nformed a loose bunch by about\nhalf way round the course and were rarely out of sight of one\nanother. This slightly defeated\nthe object of the course \u2014 for\nonce one person found a con tr61 point, the rest all piled in after\nhim. Nevertheless, it was very pleasing to see everyone\nfinishing the course in under\nan hour, and it looks as though\nUE club has gained quite a number of talented fresher s this year.\nD.L. Rosen\n\n"

Well,\nCtive put about the story that there were\ntechnical problems in the first week but\nreally he spent all week floating back\nto earth after the compliments he received\nfor the Freshers FELIX. Having managed\nto squeeze his head back into the office,\nhe duly managed to edit my article last\nweek. Not only did he edit it, he also didn't print it!\n...So this week we get a bumper edition...\nNUS Travel Office\nFor those old lags who remember that\nthere once used to be a travel office, and\nfor those Freshers who wonder why it\nisn't open, here is the unabridged version\nof what the f...k' s going on. Firstly, the NUS Travel Office is situated in the\nUnion Lower Lounge next to the pinball\nmachines, but you may have noticed the\ntotal lack of sales assistants in the\nOffice. Now NU STS are on a7 year\ncontract (until 1980) to use that room as a Travel Centre and up to now, ie since July, they haven't opened it. A constant\nstream of phone calls to the NU STS headquarters has failed to get them to\nto provide us with the necessary staff\nalthough a couple of swift reminders\nabout the room hire (\u00a3200 p.a.) fell on\nmore fertile soil. So the present position\nis that the Union is raking in \u00a3200 p.a. for a room which is never used and you have to go to Victoria to get your rail cards, etc. Finally, to quote a let t pr from Chris Morgan, ( NUS National\nTreasurer) . . . 'the Board (NUSTS) and\nthe Exec, NUS) have been concerned . . . to\ndefine a means for preserving NU STS Ltd. so that it can continue to offer its services to our membership.' Seems\nquite simple to me, Chris r. OPEN THE OFFICE!!!

Any clubs who have life members'\nas Captain, President or committee\nmembers should inform me in the Union\n(int 3915) so that we have a comprehensive list before we start discussions. Keep on Trucking\nDue to a very generous offer from a teaching member of the Physics staff, the\nUnion may well find itself in possession\nof a truck. The truck hasn't been M.O.T' d for four years but it is in good nick\n(honest). If anyone has a need for a large truck and is willing to look after it\nthen get in touch with me. The truck will be free to the most worthy cause( after\nslipping me a couple of quid).\nSt. Catherine's, Cumberland Lodge.\nThis is an organisation which holds\ndiscussion weekends at their lodge in\nthe Great Park, Windsor.

    "content": "Tuition fee increase worries Rector\nRector rejects Green\nShield stamp idea\nStudent\nnumbers\nup\nAt a Board of Studies meeting\non Wednesday it was revealed\nthat undergraduate admissions\nto IC are up by over ten per\ncent on last year's figures,\nbringing the (provisional)\ntotal numbers in the college\nfrom 4100 to approximately\n4250. A consistent boom in\nadmissions over the past two\nyears has reduced the percentage by which intake falls short of target levels from\n14% to a mere 1%.\nThe increase reflects a nationwide rise of 4.6%\nestimated by UCC A \u2014 in other\nwords 3,500 more university\nstudents throughout Britain. And even this increase is small compared to the 8 . 7 %\nincrease in applications from\nschool-leave r s,un deter ed by\nfears of graduate unemployment.\nPoly figures good In general the admissions\nincrease is not thought to\nrepresent a lowering of\nstandards, and it is likely to\nbe felt mostly in scientific\nand engineering departments,\naccording to a THE S report\nlast Friday. An even greater\nincrease in admissions has\noccurred at polytechnics with\na20% rise at Sunderland, and\nthis is in spite of government\ncut-backs on teacher-training.\nUniversities chiefly affected\nare Bradford, Birmingham,\nStirling, City, Hull, Manchester\nand Southampton.\nAndrew Evans\nCOPY-DATE FOR NEXT\nISSUE: 2\npm TODAY;.\nby\nDavid Hopkins &\nClive Dewey\nTHE RECTOR, Sir Brian Flowers, last Thursday warned\nof the dangers of Government imp rad tuition fee increases,.\nIn his Commemoration day adc ir. tie foresaw this producing\na dramatic drop in university applications, such that\nRegistrars might offer 10-fold Green Shield stamps on\ncompletion of a registration form. He hoped that IC would\navoid this era of promotion gimmicks. 'A panic scramble\nfor students' was, thought, a real possibility said the\nRector.\nAlready the Government has\nforced universities to increase\ntheir tuition fees, whilst at\nthe same time decreasing the\nmoney available to them from\nthe University Grants Committee.\nThe Rector believes that an\nincreasing proportion of\ncollege finance will therefore\nhave to come from tuition fees. However he did not make\nclear in his speech how a drop\nin student numbers would be\nspread between home and\noverseas students.\nJobs in jeopardy\nThe UGC grant to universities\nfor 1977\u20148 has already been cut\nby 4% compared to this year's amount. However, some\nobservers believe that the\nUGC cuts in real terms will be around 1 0 % and that a cutback of this magnitude\nwould inevitably lead to\nredundancies. Some campus\nunions even voice the view\nthat a real cut of 4% would\nput some jobs in jea por dy at\nIC.\nHuddie report\nNevertheless the Rector\nthought that Imperial College, as a science and technology\ncentre, would be less affected\nthan most by the increased\ntuition fees. If not in a position\nto expand, there were plans to\nbroaden the scope of courses. Sir David Huddie's report, on\nthe non-technological academic\ndevelopment of IC, recommends\nthat several new subjects and\nnew combinations of existing courses be offered. The College intends to establish a new chair in Economics and\ndevelop activities in Industrial\nPsychology. These plans, though, may well be tempered\nby present economic factors\nsaid the Rector.\nAlthough post graduate\ncourses are losing popularity,\nthere, was an increase in undergraduate applications (see\n'Student numbers up', this\npage). .Over '6,000 were\nreceived.^ over a thousand being\nadmitted; this is the highest\nnumber for ten years. The\nRector went on to welcome\nthe recent White Paper on PG education (see page 2).\nHis speech was in the\n'spirit of optimism', and Sir\nBrian hoped that in the future\nIC would produce students\nwith a much broader outlook.\nOverall he felt that academic\nstandards at IC were as high\nas ever.\nIndividual initiatives\nTalking about a notable\nnon-academic achievement he\nsaif i, 'With generous financial\nsupport, a broad combination\nof Imperial College talent came\ntogether to produce a revolutionary design aimed at\nstiffness and lightness'. He\nwas of course referring to the\nnew boat designed by the\nLubrication Laboratory that\nwas to have been used in the\nMontreal Olympics. RAG GOES\nLEGAL Collecting moe ny for charity\nduring this year's Rag Proc es sion will have an air of\nlegality that it has lacked in previous years.

    "content": "14 - FELIX, OCTOBER21 st1976 STUDENT WORLD\nEDITED BY ANDREW EVANS\nFrankenstein Turns Industrialist\nWhilst Havard and the local mayor\nargue about the dangers of recombinant\nDNA research, Professor George Wald, a leading scientist at Harvard, warns that\npublic attention is misdirected and that\nit is from industry that the greatest\ndanger comes. University research was, he stressed, dependent on government\nsubsidy, whereas industry did not have\nthis rein.\nDr Henry Ros ov sky, Dean of the\nDepartment of Arts, emphasised the\ndifficulties of government control of\nbiological research, owing to the divisibility of.the subject into small units.\nThe industrialist and the back-street\ngeneticist are not likely to be so scrupulous as Dr Har Gobind Khorana who recently synthesised an artificial gene at\nMassachusetts after nine years' work.\nFight At Middlesex\nA legal dispute is likely to occur between\nMiddlesex Polytechnic's Joint Edu cation Committee and the Nursery\nAction Group, following the JE C's decision to withdraw its funds from the\npolytechnic's nursery. The decision was\nmade on the basis of aDES ruling.\nThe nursery, which students regard\nas an ' essential service', was born of a sit-in 1974 and another sit-in occurred\nwhen fees were raised last year.\nA meeting is to be held between the\nNAG and the J EC this week and if no\nagreement is reached, legal action will be taken by NAG. LLvetpool\nTrouble is brewing at Liverpool University between students and dons\nabout the fact that more than 200 first\nyears are living out in lodgings, some\nmany miles away, whilst Hall is by no\nmeans fill. Meanwhile the \u00a31!4 million\narts library, containing about half a million books, was opened on September\n6th. The library is named after Sydney\nJones, Lord Mayor of Liverpool from\n1938 to 1941 and benefactor of the\nuniversity.\n'Right Approach' To Education\nThe Conservative Party devoted ten\nlines to higher education policy in their\nnew pamphlet 'the Right Approach' this\nweek. In it they recommend a review of how polytechnics are financed and better\npublicity at schools concerning higher\neducation opportunities.\nSit-in peace formula found\nThe threat of Government cut-backs\nin education expenditure has forced the\nAssociation of University Teachers to\ncome to terms and declare a 'Geneva\nConvention' for s it in s, according to a THE S report last week. The convention\nrecommends regular contact between\nstudent unions and local associations, advance warning to staff of direct action, and \"reasonable conduct during any\ndisruption\".

The debate will\nbe shown live at 1pm at TV sets in the J CR, Southsitte &\nthe Union.\nFine all-round\nrugby\nThe game began with IC having slightly more of the\nplay than QM C; However after\nabout !4 hour a set piece\nresulted in a QM C overlap\nwhich sent\" their wing over for\na try which was converted.\nIC responded strongly and\nwithin ten minutes the pressure\nwas rewarded when Robins\npicked up from the base of the\nscrum and went over for a fine try. Cotter converted to\nlevel the scores. The remainder\nof the first half was played out\nwith some exciting rugby by\nboth teams but with no addition\nto the score line. In the second half IC attacked from the whistle and\nwere unlucky not to take the\nlead when Cotter attempted a40 yd dropkick which dipped\nunder the bar at the last\nmoment. Five minutes later\nWilliams was too unlucky not\nto score. His patience was rewarded soon after when he ran\nin a try from 30 yards. The try\nwas un converted( score 10\u20146).\nQMC replied strongly but\nIC countered with a fine try\nfollowing as erg ing burst of\nspeed by Asp den, who laid the\nball off to the eager support of\nscrum-half Price-Step hens.\nCotter again converted.\nIn the last !4 hour IC defended some fine tackling\nfrom both backs and forwards\nthe most \"outstanding, being\ndue to West.

The same\nwarden later admitted that he had not\nseen the detailed plans and that his remarks were somewhat partisan ly aimed\nat his own residents.\nNevertheless his remarks, all be they\nflippant; do highlight the general ignorance\nand lack of college discussion on the\nnew extension. College and Student Union\nleaders have thrashed out the plans for\nthe building and are in the process of\napplying for planning permission. That\ncould be granted next Thursday; yet how\nmuch do hall residents and college\nemployees know about the scheme \u2014 I believe very little.\nAlthough late in the day FELIX intends\nlooking at the College proposals and at\nthose put forward by the local residents\nassociation.

This device allows you to buy a lOp\nticket (You must have a ticket,\nit is illegal without one) and\nfill out the slip for the balance\nof the 'offical fare'.\nThe onus is then on London\nTransport to collect this\nbalance off you. The group\nhope these tactics will pressure\nthe authorities into providing\na better service and lower\nfares, with the service being\norientated towards the user\nmaking excess student appeal\nrather than\nprofits.\nThe present policy of\nLondon Transport of higher\nfares and reduced services is, according to a Fare Fight\nspokesman doing more damage\nto the transport system than\nFare Fights tactics. (There\nhave just been cuts On the\nCentral line and ones are\nplanned for the Bakerloo).\nTo: LONDON TRANSPORT EXECUTIVE\nI have today travelled from_ Date.\nto\nand tendered a ticket for p. Should you wish to recover the\noutstanding sum, my name and address is:\nName Address.\nSigned.\nIt is quite simple to use Deferred Payment Slips\nlike the one printed here. Simply buy a ticket\nfor less than the \"official\" fare - - whatever you\nthink is reasonable. Present it at the other end,\ntogether with a completed slip (you may need to show\nsome identification). Then it's up to LT to chase you\nfor the extra money. It is illegal to get on a train\nwith no ticket, so get at least a lOp one. Full\ndetails are on the FARE FIGHT leaflet \"Dragging It\nOut\" which is available free with books of 24 slips\n(2p per book, plus p&p) from FARE FIGHT, Flat 3,\n76 Sidney Street, London E.l.(7909965).

OCTOBER21 st 1976\nT SHIRTS\nnow\navailable\nfrom the\nFelix office\nONLY \u00a31.50\nWorth seeing again\nFirst things first \u2014 the support band.\nThey were called Blue Angel. Within\nthe confines of their setup \u2014 black\nguitarist with left-handed stratocaster,\nplaying in a Hendrix Experience type\npower trio \u2014 they were reasonable.\nThey were very loud, of course. The audience applauded.\nBy half past nine the Hall began to\nlook pretty full, and I began to wonder\nwhy. Graham Parker and his band have\nbeen getting considerable coverage in\nthe music press recently, but do people\nreally take any notice of that? However,\nas soon as the band embarked upon their\nfirst number, all such doubts were swept\naway on a tide of superb good-time rock.\nGood time for all\nThe sound was clear, powerful, and\nvery pleasant \u2014 a little loud perhaps,\nbut I wouldn't have had it any other way.\nThe band were confident, ex huber ant, and enjoyed every minute of the gig, as did the audience. The Rumour have a great asset in guitarist Brinsley Schwarz,\nwhose own band, of that name, had a similar sort of good time rock and roll\nfeel to that of the Rumour, but the\nlatter win hands down on vitality, freshness, and energy.\nGraham Parker's excellent vocals\npresented a fitting contrast to the\nband, giving a rough edge to the sound.\nThey played about thirteen songs in all, including their new single 'Hotel Chambermaid'. The most notable of these songs\nwas 'Pouring it all out', from their\nforthcoming album, a magnificent song,\nwith a superb hook-line.\nEarly risers\nThis was followed by 'Back to\nSchooldays', a powerful rocker which\nhad the whole crowd on their feet by the\ntime it was over \u2014 only halfway through\nthe set! Also of note was the lament-like\n'Don't Ask Me Questions', and then 'Heat\nTreatment', the title track of their\nforthcoming album. The set closed with\nanother neat rocker, 'Soul Shoes', from\nthe 'Howlin' Wind' album.\nLive vs Vinyl\nAs with many bands of this type, one\nmust always wonder if they can match\nthe live performance on record. I reckon\nthe new album will be worth a listen to\nfind out!\nThe evening finished with two well deserved encores from the band, who by then had the audience begging for\nmore. Yes, it was certainly an enjoyable\ngig. You can still catch them at the New\nVictoria this month - do yourself a favour and see them.\nMathew Palner\nlite?**\nSATURDAY 2\n3\nRD OCT\nRj g Collections Gui las Si i ly Sports outside Harrods.

    "content": "FELIX, OCTOBER21 st19767 Punk Rock exposed\nWith the news last week that the Sex Pistols have just\nsigned a contract with EMI, that includes the largest advance\never paid to a relatively unknown group (rumoured to be around\n\u00a340,000 \u2014 that's almost twice as much as Oueen were given, and\nlook where they are now) I think it's worth taking a quick look\nat this phenomenon that has built up over the last twelve\nmonths which has come to be called 'punk rock.'. For a start,\n'the new wave', as it has come to be called, is so far solely confined to the London area, disregarding groups like the\nFeelgood and Hot Rods who, no matter what people tell you, are a different bag of balls altogether, than ? ay the Strang ler s, Clash or even the Pistols. Whereas bands like my favourite\npunk ster s the Stranglers for instance, have no trouble filling reasonable sized halls in London \u2014 in the provinces they are\na ln iii silo i ally unknown and to a greater extent misunderstood.\nVibrators sell out in Forty minutes\nTake last week for instance, 1 was present on Sunday night\nwhen the Stranglers together with the Vibrators, completely\nsold out the Nashville, London's best pub gig. People were\nqueuing for a. good hour to get in the joint, and within forty\nminutes of opening, the 'House Full' signs were up, Also just about every lig ger around was out to catch the band, from\nJohnny Rotten of the Pistols, most of the Hot Rods and even\nRay Davies to name but a few. Now its two days later. The stage has changed from the\nriotous triumph of West Kensington to the Top Rank Suite in Card ilL An abysmal crowd who don't really know quite what\nto make of the band in front of them, who must seem (to the\ncrowd) to have just crawled out of a sewer. As the Stranglers go\nfurther into their set, with its brilliant Door/ V. Underground\nobservations, the inevitable cat calls get louder. This is not\nhelped.by the equipment problems that beset the band on almost\nevery gig (unbelievably, although the PA is quite modern,\nsome of the amps date back to pre Vox67' s). The Stranglers\nlimp off to lick their wounds, no doubt thinking about next\nweek's two sell out gigs at Hammersmith Odean with Patti\nSmith\nOr take the Sex Pistols, they're bigger than any of the new\nwave in London.'It's no good going to a Pistols to queue for a couple of hours before the doors are opened. Three weeks ago they played the unlikely Stow Away Club in Newport, Gwent, a sort of over 21s nightclub, where 'gentlemen' must wear a jacket at all times and jeans are a no-go.\nIII Obscure record labels\nNot many of the punks have recorded yet, those who have\nare to be found on obscure labels like Stiff Records and Chiswick These are available from Bizzar e Record s,33Pread St, London\nW2:\nThis week To come to the present, tonight's best gigs are at City University, where Meal Ticket are playing; String Driven Thing\nshould provide fireworks at the Marquee, On Saturday Welsh\nrock ' n' rollers Crazy Cavern supported by ll ell raisers should\nbe good at the Nashville, If you feel like digging deep into\nyour pockets then Cado Belle are at the Rock Garden, Covent\nGarden on Monday; at the Nashville on the same night are\nFrench rockers Little Bob Story \u2014 with their dwarf lead vocalist \u2014. sure to pack them in, Tuesday sees S B&Q at Hammersmith (check the ticket\nsituation) and Graham Parker at the New Victoria. The other\nmain attractions are the Groundhogs at the Marquee (their\nfirst of two dates). At the Collegiate Theatre, Gordon Street,,\nBert Jansch will be on. Best gig on Sunday will be Frankie Miller's appearance at\nthe Roundhouse, Chalk Farm; the supporting act Shanghai is also quite hot. They feature Cliff Bennett and ex\u2014John Kidd\nguitarist Mike Green; Meal Ticket open the bill. What' s On entries\nThat's all for now; if you've any suggestions as to what I should feature in these columns please send them to me c/o FELIX office.\nIt would also be appreciated if a few more college clubs sent in details of their activities to FELL X., WW\nWelsh rugby team Among the army of bouncers the club employ, the Stow\nAway boasts two of the infamous 'Pontypool front-row', who\nform part of the Welsh rugby team. Can you imagine the response\nthe Pistols got when they played numbers like Anarchy in the\nIK'' The fallacy music papers perpetrate\nSo while the three bin niu su weeklies laud their praise on these bands, and record companies make the inevitable rush to\nsign any group of degenerates who happen to know two chords\nand sniff glue, it's worth remembering that the so called 'new\nwave' is only but a small ripple confined to London, with no\nreal signs that it will spread to any great degree, and it is not\nthe most revolutionary thing to happen since the other revolution,\nas those misinformed scribes of 'Sounds' would have us believe. Apart from the Patti Smith/Stranglers gig this weekend, if\nyou'd like to sample some of the new bain ds playing this week\nthen I suggest the ICA off the Mall on Saturday night where\nthe Clash, Subway Sect and Snatch Sound can be heard. On Thursday the Dammned play at the Red Cow in Hammersmith\nRoad, and also support Graham Parker and the Rumour at New\nVictoria on Tuesday,\nFRIDAY 2\n2\nND OCT\nFilm Films oc: Sugarland Express.
