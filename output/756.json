Festival Director Sean\nKeegan has been scouring other\nfestivals and colleges for months for\npotential participants and\neventually seventeen shows have\nbeen chosen. They will be\nperformed in the Bloomsbury\nTheatre itself in the specially\nconstructed festival studio, which\nprovides a more intimate\natmosphere for smaller-scale\nproductions.\nApart from the main shows there\nare lunchtime discussions and talks\nfrom members of the RJC and NT,\nDerek Jacobi, Maureen Lipman\nand Michael Green on 'The Art of\nCoarse Acting'. In the afternoons\nthere are workshops for potential\nactors, directors and scriptwriters.\nThe evenings are filled with cabaret\nacts including students and highly\noriginal performers such as Jenny\nLeCoat and the Joan Collins Fan\nClub. The price of these tickets are\nalso available at \u00a315.00, and so all in\nall it is a very cheap way to finish the\nterm off in a cultured manner.\nThe performers are drawn from\ndrama and university colleges and\npolytechnics from all over the\ncapital, and before you think that\nwe scientists are being left out again\nImperial College Dramatic Society\n(or rather its touring group, Beit\nTheatre, to be more precise) is\nrepresented oy the play 'The Lucky\nOnes' which was a great success this\nyear in Edinburgh and sold out\nwhen it was performed in college for\nthree nights earlier this term. It is on\nat 2.30 pm on Friday 14th and at\n5.30 pm on Saturday 13th. Although the festival is effectively\nrun by UCL, members of all\ncolleges, including I.C., are being\nencouraged to join in.

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday November 28th19862 No Fairy\nGodmothers\nHere\nDear David,\nIn your last issue (FELIX 754,\nFriday November Nth) there were\nmisleading reports and comment on\nsupposed College policies\nconcerning student numbers and\nresidence.\nThe College has not been asked to\nincrease its home student numbers\nby 10%, but last year and this the\ntarget for home undergraduates was\nnot achieved by about that\npercentage. Policy is, therefore, to\nget back on course as defined in the\nCollege Plan.\nIn 1977/78 there were 4,470 full-time students. The provisional\ncount for this year is 4,890. There\nwere 1,342 student places in College\nmanaged residences in 1977/78.\nThere are 1,840 this year. Residence\nplaces have therefore more than\nkept pace with the increase in\nstudent numbers over the past\ndecade. 1982/83 was the best year\nfor residence places. There were\n2,064. It has not been easy to obtain\nso many head tenancies since then,\nbut we have greatly increased\ncompany lets which facilitate\nprivate sector renting. If what your\npredecessors wrote about some of\nour head tenancies is to be believed\nthat is just as well. We also had a better supply of short life property a few years ago. Because of difficulties\nin clearing some students out when\nre-development was possible,\nowners have become much more\nwary of student occupation. The\nCollege has, in resp nse, made an\neffort to increase the availability of\nfamily flats because short life\nproperty was primarily of interest to\nmarried students. We have 28 now\nand another 7 under construction.\nThe hall proposed for over the\nswimming pool is not the College's solution to the problem. There is no\nsingle solution. There need to be\nmany. A hall on land we own for\naround 175 will help but known\ndemand would absorb another\n1,000 places. There are two major\nconstraints in obtaining more\nplaces. Past surveys (and there have\nbeen many) and advice from ICU\nand SRC have indicated that\nstudents will not be prepared to live\nmore than a mile or two away\n(Hamlet Gardens has been quoted\nas too far) and the argument has\nalways been that rents should be\nkept well below those in the private\nsector. There are no public funds for\nstudent residence and fairy\ngodmothers are thin on the ground\nin Knightsbridge. You cannot loan\nfinance residence places in the\nneighbourhood of the College on\nrents of \u00a330 per week for 38 weeks of\nthe year. Accept rentals of \u00a340 and a5 mile cycle ride and we can be in\nbusiness.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Smith\nCollege Secretary\nDouble\nPrinciples\nDear Sir\nI would like to make a point\nconcerning the letter by John\nMartin in last week's FE1IX (755).\nHe states: 'It is, in my opinion,\ncowardly and dishonest to\ndistribute leaflets with no name on',\nconcerning the Anti-Nuclear Power\nleaflets that were handed out at the\nCareers Fair. May Iremindhim that\nat the last U GM, at which Mr\nMartin opposed the Barclays Bank\nmotion, leaflets were handed out\nwith Barclays Bank propaganda,\nbut with no name of an IC society.\nHas Mr Martin got double\nprinciples? At the previous U GM, there were leaflets handed out with\nthe name of an IC society that\ndoesn't exist yet. (IC Anti NUS, a ConSoc by-product).\nMay I also say that I find it ironic\nthat Barclays Bank are to sell off\ntheir South African subsidiary,\nBarclays National. It was said at the\nstart of IC Anti-Apartheid's motion\nagainst Barclays Bank that Barclays\nwould take no notice of IC Union.\nWith the result of the U GM vote,\nBarclays already having privately\ndecided to pull out of South Africa,\nthe critics of the motion were\ncorrect.\nYoursfaithfully\nAdrain Grainger\nChair I.C. Socialist Society\nGay\nTerror\nDear Editor\nI was astounded to read in\nFELIX today (Nov 21) a letter by\nJonathan Davies commenting on a supposed inference in Christine\nTaig's letter (of the previous week)\nthat John Martin was homosexual.\nRe-reading the letter by Christine\nTaig, I really could not see how he\ngot this impression. As Christine\nsaid in her defence, all she was\nsaying was that John Martin had\nprobably never been harassed for\nbeing gay. Whether or not he is is\nirrelevant. People can be accused of\nthings which aren't true with\ndamaging consequences. (Jeffery\nArcher?)\nA more important issue of this\nexchange is that it points out very\nclearly the terror induced in IC\nmales at the slightest insinuations\nthat they might be homosexual. This\namounts to a major repression of\nfreedom for those people at IC who\nfeel they are gay\u2014but also feel that\nthey would be socially unacceptable\nif they \"came out\". As an example, a friend of mine who was gay felt he\nhad to drop out of college in order to\n'come out'.\nDerek Hill\nIC Physics III\nFree Chips\nDear FELIX,\nI'm writing to congratulate\neveryone on their efforts in Rag\nWeek\u2014it was a good success this\nyear de site a bumpy start. Nearly all\nthe events raised more money than\nlast year and when all the monies\nhave been collected, Rag Week itself\nwill have raised just over \u00a37,000 for\nour charities. Well done!\nOf course, the success of Rag\nweek lies mainly on the people, but\nthe hard work of all the 'backstage'\nworkers did'nt go unnoticed. Please\ncould you convey my thanks to the\nRag Publicity Team; Mike\nCondon(!), Abraham, Mike\nCopperwhite, Robin, Simon and\nRobert for their amazing\nenthusiasm; the Rag Committee;\nRachel, Nigel, Judith, Bridget and\nSinion and everyone who helped in\nGuilds, RCS and Mines; the Rag\nReporter Emma (the guinea\npig\u2014did you spot her at the beer\nfestival?); my own helpers Aiden,\nBenjamin, Mike and Kal and lastly\neveryone I 've managed to miss out.\nYou were all great and if you're ever\nin Liverpool, you can have some\nfree chips fr m my dad'sc hippy. Thank you to you also FELIX for\nputting up with me in your office\nand surviving my barricade of jokes\nday after day.\nMan Tai Tseung\nRag Chairman\nNo\nVictory\nDear David\nI believe that I put the view of the\nmajority of Imperial College\nstudents when I express my\ndisappointment that Barclays is to\npull out of South Africa. I have\nheard it said that this sell off is a victory for the 'Anti-Apartheid'\nmovement; that it may be, but it is\ncertainly no victory against\nApartheid.\nI hope that Barclays National\nunder its new name and ownership\nwill continue to actively oppose the\nApartheid system as it and many\nother British companies have done\nfor years.\nYours sincerely\nSimon Jarvis\nMech Eng 3\nRip Off\nDear Ed,\nI am a resident of Hamlet\nGardens, living in a flat that costs\n\u00a3175 per week. Beneath me, in an\nidentical flat, the occupants are\nasked to pay \u00a345 a week less. The\nonly difference between them and us\nis that their flat is not rented through\nImperial's wonderful Student\nServices, who quite obviously are\nknowingly ripping off a very large\nnumber of the College's students.\nAcross the passage from my flat is a woman who pays \u00a390 A MONTH.\nI, and a good number of other\npeople, would like to know how the\nCollege can get away with this\nextortion. As if the costs of living\naren't high enough without this\nofficial blackmail.\nAlso , what has happened to the\nso-called security improvements.\nAdmittedly locks have been put on\nthe main entrances to the flats, but\nwe are not allowed to lock them\nuntil entry-phones are installed and\nGod only knows when that will\nhappen. We were given keys for\nthese locks, which were\nsubsequently recalled when it was\nrealised that our front door keys\nwould open these locks, all of them\nthat is. In fact the key I was given for\nthese new locks, which was identical\nto all the others given out, opened\nmy flat's front door. If this is\nimproved security, then the College\ncan stick it where it belongs.\nSteven Mercer\nPhysics 2\nThank\nYou\nCliff\nSir,\nMay I take this opportunity to\nthank Cliff Spooner of the Sports\nCentre for his help and enthusiasm\nin renovating the Fives' courts.\nYoursfaithfully,\nDavid Nicolson\nHon. Sec. Fives\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday November 28th198611 Korjball\nPotential\nOn Sunday 23rd November, the\nUniversity of London Korfball team\ntravelled to Oxford for the second\ntournament of the season as\nreigning champions. Four of the\nplayers were from Imperial College.\nBeing severely weakened by a low\nturnout, U.L. struggled to their first\nvictory over Brighton B,2 \u20141, and\nSheffield, 3\u20140. Hence for the\nsecond successive tournament they\nqualified for the final against\nBrighton Polytechnic.\nThis time however, U.L. had an\nextremely inexperienced team and\nsuffered another blow when one of\ntheir more competent players\naggravated an old hand injury.\nBrighton took an early lead, and\nwith a solid looking defence, seemed\nto have the title in their grasp-but in\nthe last two minutes, U.L scored a deserved equalise r to force the game\ninto a penalty shoot out in which\ninexperience from U.L. showed with\nBrighton winning 3\u20142.\nDespite losing the title, this was a creditable performance from a team\nwho have a lot of potential for the\nfuture.\nWindpower\nOn Sunday 23th November IC\nsailing club were hosted a match\nagainst Essex University. The\nweather conditions, with a strong,\ngusting wind, looked likely to\ncreated exciting competition. In the\nfirst race IC had a commanding\nstart but Essex clawed back to have\noverall lead at the first mark.\nHowever, disaster struck at the gybe\nmark with half the fleet capsizing,\nleaving IC to coast home with a2 boat to 1 advantage, it was decided\nto reef for the second race but this\nstill did'nt stop one of the Essex\ncrews going for a swim again and IC\ncapitalized on the advantage.\nAfter lunch the wind moderated\nand it was back to full rigs. The IC\nstarts fluctuated as much as the\nwind but the poor starts were\ncompensated by superior team\ntactics which made for close and\nexciting racing with races going each\nway. In all, the success of the IC\nteam, under the guidance of acting\nCaptain Apostolos Leonidhopoulos, proved to be the best\nperformance of the season.\nTeam:Apostolos Leonidhopoulos,\nRichard Brimelow, Richard Jarman,\nGareth David, Charles, Adam\nStork, Andrea Burrows, Daniel\nLucas-Clements.\nFootball\nUnbeaten\nIC continued their unbeaten start to\nthe season in all competitions to 12\ngames in a very tough, bruising\nencounter against a very physical\nEssex side.\nIC, as usual, started slowly\nagainst a very fit Essex outfit, but\nchances were very few and far\nbetween. Essex, against the run of\nplay, took the lead, when weak\ntackling on the edge of the IC box,\nallowed their centre-forward to\nscore. IC's response was swift, and\nPaul Olden rose above the crowd to\nhead the equalise r from a Simon\nCole free-kick. The half-time score\nremained at 1-1.\nEssex took almost complete\ncontrol in the second half, once\nagain show ig IC the fitness value of\na full-time trainer, but their pressure\ngenerally amounted to nothing.\nParadoxically, perhaps, the best\nchance in this period fell to Nigel\nCollier, whose lob went over the\ncrossbar. IC's lot seemed to be up\nwhen Essex took the lead with 15\nminutes to go. But again IC showed\ntheir character and equalise d within\na minute, Alex Lunghis shot was not\nheld by the Essex Keeper and Paul\nOlden again on hand to bundle the\nball home. The score remained at\n2\u20142 till the end.\nThe replay is on Tuesday, again at\nColchester.\nTeam.A. Allen, M. Bradley, P. Ewart, P. Dyson, L. Covill, B. Wood, S. Cole, P. Olden, A. Lunghi (Capt), D. Lynne, N. Collier, Sub:N. Campbell.\nPoetic\nJustice\nDarkness had almost com let ely fallen, and with 15 seconds of extra\ntime left IC won a corner. Keelin\nfloated the ball beautifully, the ball\nskimmed over Wilson's head, and\nthen suddenly from the darkness leapt\nthe IC skipper Mark Barrow. The ball\nwas headed firmly and after a deflection it was in the back ofthe net.\nThus penalties were avoided and IC\nIPs were through to the next round of\nthe UAU.\nAlthough in overall play IC were\nnot up to the standard they showed on Wednesday, they again showed guts\nand determination to come from\nbehind twice. Russ Hardy (the ITs\nleading goalscorer) scored an\nindividual goal to tie ti at 1-1. But\nearly in the second half they were a goal behind again. Then the IC spirit\nreally showed as they pushed forward in desperation to stay in the\ncompetition. Their just reward came\n7 minutes from full time when a goal mouth scramble fell to J. Wilson\nwho hammered the ball home from7 yards, much to the delight of the\nplayers and the fans.\nHall v Hall\nSpectators in Hyde Park were\ntreated to a mind-boggling display\nof skill and pace as the two foremost\nSouthside teams did battle on a greasy pitch on Sunday. Selkirk\nquickly took advantage of superior\nplay to take the lead through\nskipper M. Birmingham. FLK, however instantly struck back with\na back-header by A. Haines (own\ngoal!) Selkirk used a strong\nfollowing wind to their advantage to\ngo in at the interval 2\u20141 up.\nWith the wind at their backs,\nFalmouth produced two quick goals\nby use of good lofted balls at the\nstart of the second period (3\u20142).\nBirmingham rallied his team and\ndue to some good work in midfield\nby J. Martin and C. Morris, Selkirk\nequalise d with the best goal of the\nmatch-A diving header by I. Charlton.\nThe game was decided when J. Street, surely the most outstanding\ncentre back I.C. has seen in years,\nwas forced to handle the ball on the\nline. The penalty was converted to\nsettle the score.\n3rds On Saturday the 3rds gained an\nimpressive draw against LH2 nds. Dominating the early stages with\nsupport from a strong following\nwind, some good attacking moves\nresulted in several efforts. Wendel\nCharles put the 3rds ahead\nout pacing the home defence and\nlobbing the advancing'keeper.\nWendel fired wide a few minutes\nlater and Mark Woodgate just failed\nto meet Martin Lake'sf lighted free\nkick, after a well-timed run.\nThe home team equalise d when\nMike Kemp, injured from a previous collision, could only palm\nthe ball onto an opposing player's head, who was unmarked at the far\npost. As the pitch deteriorated,\nsome heavy tackling and muddy\nconditions meant 8 ofthe 22 players\nwere down injured in the second half\nat some time. Chris Budgen limped\noff with twenty minutes left, made a token but somewhat ineffective reappearance before retiring his\nservices. The remaining ten players\ngrafted for the remainder of the\nmatch, securing a draw. Thanks to\nJohn Galloway for turning in a solid\nperformance in place of Kevin\nGraves, who had offered his\nformidable bulk for the needy cause\nof the Ists.\n3rds Again\nLast Wednesday IC 3rds travelled to\nCollier's Wood looking for their\nfirst league win. Only half the\nopposition turned up and when the\nother half arrived, the match was\nonly allowed to be 30 minutes each\nway.\nIC seized the early initiative\nqueueing up in threes to squander\nearly chances due to dithering when\nshooting would certainly have been\nmore effective in the wet swirling\nconditions. A somewhat surprising\ngoal put the 3rds ahead when Mike\nPlummer wrestled with the K CH goal keeper and Martin Dixon\nbundled the- ball, and himself, into\nthe net.\nThe opposition launched counter\nattacks swiftly, but a gritty team\ndefensive display in the second half\nsecured the victory\nThe 3rds held out to secure their\nfirst win, encouraging since they\nwere not playing at their best. Mike\nKemp the ex-6th team goalkeeper\nmade a solid debut, commanding\nhis defence well and making three\noutstanding saves.\nTeam:M. Kemp, C. Gordon, M. Woodgat (C),M. Lake, K. Graves,\nC.

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday November 28th1986 theatre\nJULIUS CAESAR: THE YOUNG\nVIC\nAmidst accusations of falling\nstandards in British Shakespeare, a new production of Julius Caesar\narrives. This production is set in civil-war England, using a parallel between England's revolution and that which\noccurs in Caesar's Rome as the\nreason for this setting. The effect is\nnot strong or contrived, the civil-war\nclothes leaving for me more of a Shakespearian-era feel to the\nproceedings, enhanced by the simple\n'Globe Style' ampitheatre at the\nYoung Vic.\nJulius Caesar is known as\nShakespeare's great piece of political theatre and a myriad of\ninterpretations have been wrought\nfrom its intricacies. It is unclear\nexactly what interpretation is\nintended here, other than the old one\nof the inter changi bil it y of theatre and\npolitics the power of 'acting' in\ncontrolling people.\nPick of the cast is probably Corin\nRedgrave as Brutus 'the noblest\nRoman of them all'. And Frank\nGrimes, whose voice is weak, but\nwhose swagger is Roman, is perhaps a very accurate Mark Anthony. Brutus,\nafter all, is the great orator, Anthony\nis the one who manipulates the crowd.\nOnce again, one is absorbed into\nhis classic story of ambition, idealism\nand fate. Again the brilliant intrigue\nand scale of the play becomes\napparent. Though this production\ndoes not break any drastic new\nground, it remains pleasingly\nfaith f idly to the play's tradition and is thus enjoyable Shakespeare.\nMcNeil\nGaudete, Almeida theatre Islington.\nGaudete is a seriously brilliant\npiece of theatre; unfortunately it\nfinished on Saturday.\nThe opening scene-dark bodies lie\non the stage in black plastic macs,\nclothes stitched together cover all\nthe scenery, a bale headed minister\nwakes and stumbles. This is the\ndarkness, the priests world inside his\nschizophrenic breakdown. Clothes\nrepresenting the link between the\nreality of the action just committed\nand the psychotic state.\nSubsequently he is chased from far\noutside his world by ten eb riou s characters who whip and kill, the\npriest caught between two\nimaginary worlds is said to a magical changeling.\nThe vic a is played by two actors in\nthe first half, a normal vicar who\nperuses cars and cameras and the\nschizoid double who humps all the\nlocal women, tries mystical charm\nto get them all pregnant\u2014\"There is\ngoing to a messiah born in this\nvillage\"\u2014no virgin birth here, but it\nseems this may be his deluded truth.\nWomen fall in love, refuse to\nbelieve p hot gr phi c evidence of\ninfidelity. A suicide results after a sibling love is requited.\nThe vicar struggles with himself.\nNormality loses, humping gets more\nfrenzied, local women become more\nflushed wide-legged and horny.\nFinally there is to a 'virgin' sacrifice\nat a W.I. meeting, but the village's men awaken.\nAt the meeting a ph roda is ical tea\nis consumed, a joint passed round as\nthe women wait for the vicar who\ncan't find his knife. The men per sue but too late, the vicar arrive w with\nsacrifice just in time, murder, blood,\ncomplete breakdown, the women lie\n'naked' and drugged in the state\nthey are at the beginning of the play.\nThe vicar runs and runs,\narraigned\u2014he is shot. At the end the\nvicarage, complete with all evidence\nis burnt down by the natives.\n3 and a half hours seems long but\nthe directors Julia Bardsley\n(assistant director on the\npromenade production 'Road' at\nthe Royal Court) and Phelim\nMcDermott, who also act, have full\ndramatic hold of their experimental\nformula. They do use commonplace\nimages of schizophrenia but this\nplay started life as poem by Ted\nHughes which has other depths;this\nis irrelevant to inspired drama.\nAshes: Bush Theatre at Bull and Bush Shepherds Grn\nThis play is grim, sordid, and as\nhard as nails. The plaudits,\nhowever, would indicate that the\nrevival of David Rudkins's work,\nthe first for ten years, is important.\nWould that it were not so. Such\nharsh realism as this can be\nunpleasant.\nThe striving s of a couple\ndesperate to conceive forms the\nplay's subject matter. Its style\nconsists of graphic and merciless\nobservations on parenthood, sex\nand life; humane and compassionate at times, but never, ever\ntouching.\nDennis Lawson plays the\nhusband, again teaming up with\ndirector, Rob Walker (they worked\ntogether on the remarkable TV\nseries Deadhead). Sheila Fish is his\nwife. The four-person cast is\nexcellent; the play is one of\nundoubted and unrestrained power,\nthe effect of which totally belies the\ncosy intimacy of it's Fringe venue\nabove a pub.\nA vague background to the play is\nprovided by the Ulster troubles.\nWhat sort of world is this to bring a child into anyway?, Lawson is\nwondering as he relates the gory\ndetails of a bomb attack in which a relative has been killed. Somehow\nthis is a relief compared with the\nharrowing details of his wife's pregnancy.\nThere is sharp humour\nsometimes, but it gets blacker.\nSomewhere there is optimism,\nsunlight in the park, but this\ndeparts. At the end there is nothing\nbut bleakness. Philosophical\nmuttering s inevitably turn into\nnihilism and despair. Serious\nstudents of real life may appreciate\nthis play. Others may find it horrific.\nMcNeil\nbooks\nWith a heavy thud like a slab of\nundigested plum pudding The\nChristmas Reader dropped onto my\nreview desk. I was considering\ngiving it to an Oxfam shop, but\nbearing in mind most of the articles\ninvolve over-eating and over-drinking, that would be a bit of a tasteless thing to do.\nGodfrey Smith compiled this\nbook by asking readers of his Times\ncolumn to send in their favourite\npassages and poems about\nChristmas. The result is a conglomeration of interesting and\ninspiring bits, boring bits, and bits\nthat were once interesting and\ninspiring, but now divorced from\ntheir original context are a touch\ndull. When you have read a story\nabout an American Grandma\nmaking puddings, a French\nChristmas fish dinner, Welsh roast\nhare, turkeys stuffed with truffles,\nthen another tale about Billy Bunter\nstuffing himself and ordering\nservants about, one isn't particularly interested in George\nand Martha Washington's Christmas Dinner menu.\nTo be fair, there are some good\nbits; a detective story by Arthur\nConan Doyle, where Sherlock\nHolmes finds a precious stone of\ngreat beauty and value inside the\ncrop of a Christmas goose. There is\nalso the slightly twee account of\nTiny Tim's Christmas from ' A Christmas Carol', the carol singing\nfield mice in 'The Wind in the\nReviews FELIX, Friday November 28th19868 Willows', the German and Allied\ntroops celebrating together the\nChristmas truce of 1914, the birth of\nChrist from Luke, poems by T.S. Eliot, and Walter de la Mare, and\nthe best of all, comment from\nGeorge Bernard Shaw; ' An Atrocious Institution' where he\nsays; 'like all intelligent people, I greatly dislike Christmas...we must\nbe gluttonous because it's Christmas. We must be drunken\nbecause it's Christmas. We must be\ninsincerely generous because it's Christmas; we must buy things that\nnobody wants and give them to\npeople we don't like...all because it's Christmas.\nThe morality of consuming vast\namounts of turkey, fed on grain\nimported from developing\ncountries, when we need neither\nturkey nor stuffing nor cranberry\njelly is something that killjoy\npuritans like myself worry about.\nWorld trade certainly\u2014exploitation\nis slightly more dod gy. How many\npeople in hospital after drunken\ndriving accidents this New Year will\nfeel any peace or goodwill? And will\nmost people be happily ensconced in\nthe cosy bosom of the nuclear\nfamily, as this book implies.\nBy all means buy this book if you\nwant to\u2014it casts \u00a35.95 and it may\neven come in handy as a Christmas\npresent. It's just the kind of book\nwe'll need when suffering\nindigestion and food poisoning.\nSarah Kirk\n'Labyrinth' is a fairy story, a whimsical fantasy flavoured with\npy than esque humour, sure al art and\na large dollop of David Bowie. It\ntells the story of Sahra, a headstrong\nteenager who finds herself whisked\ninto a mystical land inhabited by a plethora of strange creatures.\nTo her chagrin Sahra is told that\nshe has only thirteen hours to solve\nthe enormous labyrinth before the\nevil King, played by Bowie, turns\nher baby brother into a goblin. She\nis helped on her quest by a cuddly\ngnome and rather cute eight foot tall\nyeti with a per su cut ion complex and\na voice like Bob Dylan.\nThe sickeningly pretty Jennifer\nConnelly plays Sahra in a style\nwhich parodies Julie Garlands\nperformance in the Wizard of Oz.\nAs ever Mr. Bowie, manages to\nappear suave and sophisticated in\nspite of looking like something from\nthe cover of a science fiction book.\nThe musical numbers written and\nperformed by Bowie seem to fit in with the fabric of the film but taken\nout of context they can only be\ndescribed as weak and watery.\nThe puppetry work is excellent, as\none would expect from Jim Henson,\ndirector of the \"Dark Crystal\", and\nto a large extent it masks, what is at\nheart a one dimensional story line.\nStill, the film has some nice\ntouches and contains all the\ningredients to ensure that it will be a mega Christmas hit.\n'Round Midnight' takes its name\nfrom Thelonious Monk composition and, in case that doesn't give\nany clues, concerns jazz. It\nparticularly concerns a jazz\nsaxophonist, a fictional Dale\nTurner, played by the very real\nDexter Gordon. The film is based\non the relationship between Bud\nPowell and Francis Paudras and it\nportrays the way in which the\nFrench graphic artist saves the great\njazz musician from his self\ndestructive influences and gets him\nback composing again. This is not a wholly altruistic act on behalf of\nFrancis, Francois Cluzet, as he finds\ngreat inspiration through the music,\nin fact much more than through his\nformer wife, much to her\nunderstandable regret.\nThe story documents the life of\nthe musician through a series of\nclaus troph ic hotel rooms and jazz\nclubs and skillfully framed close-ups\nwhose oppressive ness is not really\napparent until there is a dramatic\nchange of scene to the seaside which\ncomes as a breath of fresh air so\nstrong you can almost smell it.\nDexter Gordon paints a very\nconvincing portrait of his character,\nso believable in fact that you\nsuspect, with some justification, that\nhe is merely reliving some moments\nof his own life. In spite of this\nimpressive performance the\nscreenplay itself does not really\nprovide enough insight into the\nmotives of Mr Gordon, particularly\nreasons for his self destructive\nbehaviour, and for this reason the\nfilm, in spite of its inforced intimacy,\nhas a remote feeling a certain\ndetachment that prevents real\ninvolvement. It is nevertheless a rather lovely film that brings a smile\nto the lips with every note that drips\nfrom the sweet saxophone. Sigh.\nI suppose it's a reflection on the\naverage cinema-goer, but\nscreenwriters seem to be getting\nyounger and younger (no it's not\nmerely a rapid ageing in the reviewer\nthat forces him to comment on the\nyouth of the police force, it's an\nunrelated phenomenon, an absolute\nrather than relative observation). So\nit is with 'Critters' a film that owes\nnot a little to 'Gremlins' and which\nwas written when the author was\nstill at college. In this case the origin\nof the Krites/Critters is not some\noriental curiosity shop but another\nplanet, they are in fact criminals\nwith voracious appetites, eating\neverything that moves.\nIt is a fairly predictable story\ninvolving a mid-Western nuclear\nfamily, a local crazy that no-one\npays attention to, an overnight\nsheriff, screaming roles for women\nand an inventive child (male). But\nwithin this formula there are some\nnice uses of subtitles for the critics\nand some imaginative editing and a wonderful scene where a Krite eats\nan ET doll after failing to engage it\nin conversation. Quite fun, in a puerile sort of way, but not an\nabsolute must.\nNor unfortunately is 'Psycho IIP\nthough it does come fairly close. It\nwas directed by it's star Anthony\nPerkins because he felt no-one else\nwould do justice to the Norman\nBates character that has virtually\nbecome his life's work.\nIt is difficult to say much about\nthe plot without giving too much\naway but basically it continues off\nwhere 'Psycho IP left off and it\nmakes several references to both\npredecessors. Though a knowledge\nof the second 'Psycho' is probably\nnot necessary, a large number of the\njokes would probably be missed if\nyou haven't seen the first one. In fact\nit is in the use of humour that Mr\nPerkins shows a fine understanding\nof the work of Hitchcock, for\nexample the modern leniency in film\nallows him to show a scene that\nHitchcock would have enjoyed, a murder whilst someone is using the\ntoilet. A flavour of the film is given\nby Norman Bates' reply to an\napology of one of his guests about\nleaving the bathroom in a state, 'I 've\nseen it worse'.\nFinally and very briefly is an\nimmensely silly, but entertaining\nfilm from John Carpenter, who\ncertainly knows how to make action\nfilms, 'Big Trouble in Little China'.\nKurt Russell, doing his best John\nWayne accent, is a truck driver who\nruns across an ancient Chinese who\nrequires a green-eyed bride (I told\nyou it was silly). It's all good wet-afternoon escapist stuff, leave your\ncynicism and prejudices at home\nand enjoy.\nSee you all at the movies!\n\n"

If it does\nprove to be a viable proposition the\nmerger will not go ahead for at least\ntwo years. The Union is heavily\ninvolved in one official working\ngroup, looking at the effect of the\nmerger on student unions and\nstudent affairs. No major decisions\nare being made by this working\ngroup; its aims are to identify the\nareas where there are likely to be\nproblems, with a view to finding\nfirm solutions during the next\nacademic year. At present Jackie\nPeirce and I are the Union reps on\nthis group, but it's intended to call in\nother people once we get down to\nfiner details. There will also be\nstudent representation on the group\nlooking at the effect of the merger\non undergraduate and postgraduate courses.\nSo where are the main problems\nlikely to occur?\nThe effects of the merger on\nordinary student life at Imperial are\nunlikely to be very great. St. Mary's students appear to have much more\nto worry about. As a small college\nwith one hall of residence around\nwhich much of the social life\nrevolves; they have justifiable\nworries about losing their identity,\nbeing swallowed up by a large\ninstitution where it is no longer\npossible to know everybody, at least\nby sight; and losing control of\nstudent-run facilities.\nThe question of identity, seen\nfrom this end, seems a minor\nproblem. The fact that IC consists of\nConstituent Colleges, each retaining\nits own identity, and the fact that St.\nMary's is across the park at\nPaddington, mean that the medical\nschool is likely to remain very much\na separate body within the College.\nThe question of facilities and\nclubs is more complex. If the merger\nproceeds, the St. Mary's students\nwill no longer be able to rely on the\ngoodwill of their college\nadministration over bars, catering\noutlets, sports facilities and so on.\nSteps must be taken to ensure that\nthose students do not lose control of\nthe facilities they have, for some\ntime, been running for themselves.\nAs for clubs, St. Mary's has no clubs\nthat IC doesn't already have. Some\nof St. Mary's clubs, for instance\ntheir renowned rugby team, will\nwish to remain as separate entities;\nothers would probably be better to\namalgamate and pool resources.\nRelevant club captains at IC and St.\nMary's will be contacted soon so\nthat we can identify potential\nproblems and sources of conflict\nearly on.\nThis brings us on to the really\nthorny question\u2014Union finance\nand administration. St. Mary's Union would have to claim to ICU\nfor funds as our Constituent College\nunions do\u2014this could well cause\nresentment. It seems likely that in\nthe event of a merger the college\nwould guarantee a supplement to\nour sub vent ion to allow for level\nfunding of St. Mary's Union\n(adjusted to take account of clubs\nwhich have amalgamated), for a period of a few years, to allow time\nto sort out the problems of an\nintegrated finance system. This is\nprobably the area where most\nconflicts will occur\u2014and it will take\ntime to iron them out.\nOther questions of Union\norganisation after a merger include\nthe need for adequate representation of St. Mary's students within\nboth college and the Union;\nprovision for St. Mary's students to\nattend Union meetings and to take\npart in all activities...these are, in\ntheory, minor constitutional\nproblems easily overcome by a bit of\ncommonsense. What is less\nstraightforward is the host of\nadministrative problems we will face\nif we are to become a fully integrated\nsplit-site Union\u2014problems it is\ndifficult to identify as yet. The\nmerger proposal comes at a time\nwhen the structure and administration of the Union is already\noverburdened; it gives us yet\nanother reason to think seriously\nabout our long-term aims and how\nbest to achieve them.\nBEIT HALL\nTwo Subwardens are required for next term. The\nSuccessful applicants are likely to be Postgraduates\nwith at least one year left at College.

The fall in the real\nvalue of grants, estimated at\nbetween 15% and 20% since 1979,\nalso meant that talent in the\nworking class was not being fully\ndrawn on - mature students from\n' lower income families being among\nthe hardest hit. 60% to 70% of\nstudents whose grant was calculated\nto include a parental contribution\nwere not receiving the proper\namount.\nThe Committee of University\nVice-Chancellors pointed out that\nthe stress caused by financial\nworries can result in under-performance and health problems.\nThey also said that the social\ncomposition in universities made it\nclear that not all the country's talent\nwas utilized.\nThe Committee of Directors of\nPolytechnics was highly critical of\nGovernment plans to deny students\nthe housing and supplementary\nbenefits which they felt 'were a vital\npart of the support system'.\nA Funny Story\nBy Alan Rose\nThere were raised eyebrows at the\nUndergraduate Studies Committee\nlast Tuesday when the ICU Hon.\nSec. regaled the assembled\nacademics with stories of his father's garage, which he claimed to be\nanalogous to the state of higher\neducation today.\nC& GU A AO Hugh Southey was\nheard to hiss loudly 'For god's sake\nshut him up Pete!' to RCS A AO Peter Hartley, a task Mr. Hartley\nwas unable to perform.

Dr\nChari g of the Museum's Four members of the City & Guilds\nUnion braved the elements this\nMonday when they performed a sponsored streak around the Albert\nHall to raise money for Rag.

These take into account\nthe steadily increasing number of\nhome students, the proportion of\n18-19 year olds entering full-time\nhigher education, and the growing\nnumber of mature entrants.\nProportions of women students are\nalso expected to continue rising.\nThe total number of 18-19 year\nolds will fall by one-third in the\n1990's so a fall in numbers is\npredicted, followed by a rapid\nincrease.\nIf present proportions remain\nconstant student numbers should go\nfrom 693 thousand in 1985 to 700\nthousand in 1989, 616 thousand in\n1996 and 633 thousand in 2000.\nHowever, if the trends towards\nincreasing proportions entering\nhigher education continue, student\nnumbers could be 723 thousand in\n1989,691 thousand in 1996, and 723\nthousand in 2000. Mr. Baker said\nthat the projections should not be\ninterpreted as statements on\ngovernment policy, but that he\nwould carefully study the\nimplications for the future funding\nand planning of higher education.\nPhoenix Hits\nThe Streets\nThis week marked the centenary of\nthe Phoenix, the annual literary\nmagazine of Imperial College. The\ncentenary edition was launched\nyesterday lunchtime at a party in the\nOld FELIX Office, Beit Building.\nBut the week's celebrations\nstarted with a lecture from John\nMaddox, Editor of Nature\nmagazine, held on Tuesday. A packed Read lecture theatre listened\nto Maddox argue that 'Scientists\ncannot write to save their lives'. He\nillustrated his argument with\nexamples of scientists who have\nfalsified their results, as well as\nexamples of poor writing.\nMaddox also argued that\nscientists write too much, in a frantic\neffort to save their careers by\namassing as many papers as\npossible.\nA lively question and answer\nsession followed the talk. One\nmember of the audience questioned\nMaddox's constant use of the\npronoun 'he' to refer to scientists,\nand suggested that this may put\nwomen off science. Maddox\nchallenged the questioner to\nproduce data to support the\nargument that this convention had\nany effect on recruitment of women\ninto science.\nA careers seminar, for students\nwho wish to become journalists, was\nheld on Wednesday in Mech. Eng.\n220. The audience was able to fire\nquestions at Wynford Hicks,\nfreelance journalist and lecturer in\njournalism; Nina Hall, science\ncorrespondent of the Times Higher\nEducation Supplement, soon to be\nphysical science editor of the New\nScientist;aad Shiona Llewellyn,\ncareers advisor at IC, and sometime\nmanaging editor of Radio Times and\nTime Out.\nTonight is the climax of the\ncentenary week celebrations, the\ngrand centenary dinner at the\nRector's residence, 170 Queen's Gate. Guests will be treated to fine\nwines, food and music, with string\nquartet and jazz band.\nMany ex-editors of Phoenix will\nbe present, including Prof. Sir\nGeoffrey Wilkinson, editor of\nPhoenix in 1942, and the only editor\nto have received a Nobel prize (so\nfar).\nThis year's editor, like many of\nhis predecessors, is a chemistry\nstudent. Christopher Edwards'\nedition of the Phoenix is available,\nprice 50p, from the bookshop,\nlibraries, and FELIX Office.\nDinosaur Discovered\n\n"

It is through UL U that students are effectively represented in the decision making processes of the Central University. on\nUNIVERSITY\nCOMMITTEES\n^ on\nACADEMIC\nSTANDARDS\nWithout this representation students would have no say in the policy decisions of the Federal University that affect every aspect of the education they receive. Without UL U as a representative voice the University Authorities would be able to dictate regardless of the needs or wishes of students on everything from the levels of College Funding to Academic Appeals Procedures. At a time of increasing pressure on academic standards and educational resources the need for students to be effectively represented and have the ability to organise is paramount. Both come through UL U. Without such an input into decisions the Westfield College site would probably have been sold off two years ago! "

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday November 28th19864 Union Services\nPresident Christine Taig enthuses\nabout special events in Services\nWeek.\nImperial College\nUnion will be 75 years\nold next month. In\ncelebration of this\nmomentous occ as sion ICU is organ is iona series of events to\npromote the Unionrun services; the Bar,\nthe Snack Bar, the\nBookshop and the\nSports Shop.\nAsk any old past student of Imperial\nCollege (and you'll generally find\nplenty hanging around in Southside\nor the Union Bar) and they'll tell\nyou that the Students' Union has\nchanged beyond all recognition over\nthe last decade or so. The major\nchange has been the provision of\nservices as a prominent feature of\nthe Union...from being little more\nthan a conglomeration of clubs and\nrepresentatives on various college\nbodies, the Union has developed\ninto quite a trading venture, running\nits own bars, snack bar, bookshop,\nsports hop; with a host of rooms and\nfacilities for students to use.\nThe changes continue; the\nUnion's75 th anniversary falls in the\nyear when we are having to look\nseriously at our organisation, trying\nto make ourselves more efficient in\norder to cope with the increased\npressures of running our trading\noutlets. The probable inclusion of\nSt. Mary's Hospital Medical School\ninto the Imperial College fold' is\nanother big change on our horizon,\nwhich will probably precipitate even\nmore expansion of the aims and\nservices of the Union.\nTo mark the 75th anniversary of\nthe Union we have decided to\nconcentrate on the Union's trading\noutlets with a 'Services Week'. The\nUnion's trading outlets are vital to\nits existence; not only are they low-cost, good value services run by\nstudents for students; but also any\nprofit made goes straight back into\nimproving Union facilities.\nThose who see the Students'\nUnion as a hotbed of radicalism full\nof shifty individuals trying to further\ntheir political careers couldn't be\nfurther off the point (you're\nwelcome to come and spend a day in\nthe office if you don't believe me!) -the majority of the time seems to be\nspent rushing round trying to\ncoordinate the activities of over a hundred clubs, ensuring that the\nbills get paid and trying to stop the\nbuilding falling apart\u2014all on a very\nlimited budget\nHowever I don't think we do so\nbadly\u2014and now's your chance to\nfind out for yourself.\nThere's a special event in the\nUnion building every day from\nTuesday to Friday\u2014starting with\nthe best birthday party around with\nlive music, discos, videos...not to be\nmissed. Wednesday's Australian\nnight should be mind-blowing\u2014and\nexpect to see a few St. Mary's students around that night. On\nThursday we have a touch of\ntradition with a combined C CU night in the bar; and on Friday the\nmore sophisticated amongst you\ncan book a table for a meal in\nNorman's with impeccable service\nand cocktails to boot. Then on\nSaturday we take over the Sherfield\nbuilding (now there's an idea;..) for\nthe Great Anniversary Carnival\nwith Sandie Shaw and Zeke\nManyika. All in all a week not to be\nmissed \u2014 and you thought\neverything stopped after Rag\nWeek...\nServices week extends further\nthan the Union building though;\ndon't forget the special offers in the\nbookshop and sports hop. And we\nstill have a trick up our sleeve; to\nliven up the Birthday U GM on\nTuesday, 2nd December, there's a special appearance by Martin S Taylor who'll be performing a few\nmagic tricks.\nWell, enjoy the week; and if you\nfeel like a75 year old by the end of it,\nI don't suppose you'll be the only\none...\nthere's the\nUnion Sports Shop\nInternal Services Officer Alan Rose\ngoes on a bit about his job and\nrepeats a few things Christine said.\nIn addition to its many other roles,\nICU runs four trading outlets, all\noffering goods to students at knock-down prices. The Bookshop, which\nhas been around for over ten years,\nhas more recently been joined by the\nSports Shop (also on the Sherfield\nWalkway) the Union Snack Bar\n('Normans') and, most recently, The\nUnion Bar.\nAlthough primarily a service, all\nfour are run as profit-making\nconcerns in order to cope with their\ninevitable slack periods of business.\nThere is no other sensible way to\nmanage a \u00a3'/2 million annual\nturnover.\nAny profit that is made by the\noutlets can go either on improving\nthe quality of the service offered (eg\nthe video recorder and music system\nfor the Union Bar or the\nrefurbishment programme in\nNorman's) or directly into Union\nFunds (eg the dividends paid by the\nBookshop to ICU and the three\nCCU's). Each outlet is run on a day-to-day\nbasis by a full time manager who is\nanswerable to a management\ncommittee. These committees are\nco-ordinated by the Internal\nServices Committee which also\nhandles interaction and long term\nplanning. The ISC is answerable to\nthe IC U GM through the Internal\nServices Officer.\nThe last year, 1985/6 was a very\nsuccessful one for Union Services\nwith all four trading outlets showing\na surplus (profit). Therefore, to\ncoincide with ICU's75 th birthday\nnext week, there will be a number of\npromotional events which you are\nall invited to take advantage of in\nrecognition of the great support that\nyou have given to your trading\noutlets.\nFeature FELIX, Friday November 28th19865 Week\nHUH\nWbewm\n1\n111Will 'IIIIIIIIIII\nBar Manager Kev\nBuckley tries to grab\nsome custom.\nAt the start of term, when the new\nlounge bar was opened, it was hoped\nthat the comfortable seating\ncombined with food and beer\noutlets would draw people back to\nthe union building and re-establish\nit as the main social centre for\nstudents at I.C. Some people expressed the\nopinion that the 'rowdy' image\nwould keep people away, while\nothers quite rightly felt that the\ntoning down of the bar by this year\nsab at ical s would make it\nunacceptable to the rowdier, heavy\nspending elements, leading again to\na loss of trade.\nMost of the feedback received,\nwould indicate both sides of the\nargument well catered for. Yes there\nhas been standing on tables, loud\nsinging, and some naked-yard-drinking, but it has been done in\nsuch a way than no-one to my\nknowledge has been offended. The\nrowdy image 'too much or not\nenough?' issue would seem to have\nbeen settled.\nAs for the hope of a new thriving\nsocial centre, well...we've tried\nputting events on, but the lack of an\nI.C. Publicity Officer has hampered\nattempts to make people aware of\nthem. Those that have turned up\nhave had a great time, eg...\nBert and family Scrogg on Sat\n22nd, one of a series of cheap beer,\nlate disco, live music Sat nights.\nMost people came because they\nwere led to believe it was 'a name\nband', very few were disappointed\nby the act put on by a mere college\nband though. Some were even 'well\nimpressed mate'. Nearly every Sat\nnight this format of entertainment\nhas been used, but because everyone\nknew it was 'only a college band' noone turned up. What does it take to\nmake students walk from the\nSouthside Halls to the Union?\nRegular happy hours Tues and\nThurs? Sat entertainment? videos\nmost nights?\nIf the answer is yes well all this has\nalready been happening, where are\nyou?\nIf the answer is no, then what?\nAre most students so idle that the\ntwo minutes they save by using\nSouthside's facilities is a prime\nfactor? Let's hope not.\nSERVICES BONANZA\nTuesday\nBirthday U GM followed by....75th birthday party in the Union\nBuilding live music, videos.\nWednesday\nSwan Lager Promotion Western Australian's favourite lager\n(export & lite) at the ridiculous price of 60p per can.\nThursday\nUnion Barnite.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nMore Money For\nImperial\nA new venture is being set-up to\nmarket the results of research\ncarried out at Imperial. The move is\nexpected to provide a major\nfinancial contribution to research at\nthe College.\nInvestors In Industry pic and\nResearch Corporation Ltd will join*\nwith the College to set up a research\ndevelopment company called\nIMPEL (Imperial Exploitation\nLtd). IMPEL will survey the\nresearch at Imperial for commercial\npotential when it is set up in\nDecember. It will also compile a register of academics who wish to\nact as specialist consultants and will\nencourage industry to use the\nCollege's research facilities.\nImperial currently earns \u00a320m each year from research work and\nIMPEL will encourage more\ncommercial applications by seeking\nout inventions and advising\nresearchers on patents, selling\nlicences and setting up new\ncompanies. \"I will be disappointed\nif in three years we haven't doubled\nour \u00a320m\" said Dr. David Thomas,\nDirector of Industrial Liason. The\ninvestors are expected to receive\n60% of the profits on their ideas,\ntheir departments taking 20% and\nCollege 20%, although this is\ncurrently under review.\nUnion Plans\nFor Parties\nThree working parties are being set\nup to look at medium term planning\nfor IC Union. The scheme was put\nforward by U GM and Council\nChairman Hugh Southey when the\nUnion Planning Group met for the\nfirst time this year on Monday. Mr.\nSouthey suggested that there be\nsmall working parties to look at\ntrading, building and general\norganisation within the Union.\nSabbatical officers Christine Taig\nand Jackie Peirce told the meeting\nthat the workload on the sabbaticals\nand permanent staff in the Union\nOffice had been greatly increased\nsince the take over of the Snack Bar\nand the Union Bar. The staffing\nstructure of the Union deserved\ncloser attention, it was explained.\nMr. Southey's proposals were\nreceived with general agreement by\nthe meeting, and members of each\nworking party chosen from amongst\nthe 12 students present at the\nmeeting. Pete Hartley, Pete Higgs\nand Hugh Southey were chosen as\nchairmen of the working parties for\nTrading, Building, and Organisation respectively. Anyone\ninterested in any of the above\nsections should contact the relevant\nChairman.\nNo Penalties\nFrom UGC\nUniversity maths and physics\ndepartments that lower entrance\nstandards will not be penal is ed by\nthe University Grants Committee.\nSir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer,\nchairman of the UGC, confirmed\nthis when asked to comment on a consultative document from the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience on Teacher Supply. He\nassured university departments that\nthey will not lose money by\ndropping admission standards for\nstudents who intend to become\nteachers.\nThis move comes in the face of\nincreasing difficulty in recruiting\nteachers in these subjects.\nOn Monday this week, the\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors and\nPrincipals (CVCP), organised a one-day event at the Royal Institution to\ndisplay ideas for meeting the\nshortage of teachers in maths,\nphysics and technology.\nThe CVCP joined with the\nprincipals of polytechnics and\ncolleges to put on the event, which\nproposed ideas for helping schools\ncope with the shortage now, and\nmaking the subjects more\ninteresting so that the supply of\nstudents and graduates is increased\nin the future.\nKey Thieves\nRaid Linstead\nCollege Security Officer Geoffrey\nReeves is appealing for information\non the series of burglaries in\nLinstead Hall, following the theft\nlast Thursday of \u00a32,000 of\nphotographic and music equipment.\nMr. Reeves is certain that the thefts\nare connected with the dis-appearance, only a year ago, of a master key for Linstead Hall. This\nkey went missing during the\nSummer period, when the Hall was\nbeing used to accommodate guests\nstaying with the Summer\nAccommodation Scheme. Since\nthen there have been several\nincidents where rooms have been\nburgled and then left locked.\nThe items stolen on Thursday\nincluded three cameras, two Sony\nwalkman s and a compact disc\nplayer. Mr. Reeves told FELIX that\nthe thieves had to have a thorough\nknowledge of Linstead Hall, and are\nalmost certainly present or former\nstudents or staff of the College.\nSecurity are particularly keen to\nspeak to two men who were seen\nleaving Linstead Hall at the time\ncarrying a blue holdall. One of the\nmen is described as 6 feet 2 inches\ntall, of Indian appearance, with very\ndark straggly hair, but \"lacking a beard and moustache\". He was\ncarrying a carrier bag with a thick\nyellow stripe. The other man was\nabout 5 feet 10 inches tall. Anyone\nwho saw these men should contact\nSecurity immediately, in confidence\nif necessary.\nMr. Reeves said that there* had\nbeen at least three \"sets of\nincidents\" since the disappearance\nof the Linstead master key, and in\neach case a number of bedrooms\nhave been entered. He is confident\nthat the crimes can be attributed to\nthe disappearance of this specific\nkey, since it is the only master which\nalso covers the Linstead extension\nto have gone missing. He explained\nthat the master key in question had\nalmost certainly been stolen, rather\nthan simply gone missing, since it\nhad been removed from a housekeeper's bunch in a locked\ncabinet.\nReeves\nAttacks Rag\nStunts Outside\nCollege\nCampus\nChief Security Officer Geoffrey\nReeves is worried that there may be\n\"a serious accident\" as a result of\nHit Squad type Rag Stunts which\ntake place outside the College\ncampus. Mr. Reeves' warning was\nmade after the incident last week\nwhen three students wer flagged\ndown and 'held at gunpoint after\nloading a car with toy guns outside\nthe Iraqi Embassy. Mr Reeves said\nthat because South Kensington was\na sensitive area, \"anyone with any\nkind of gun was going to be\nsuspicious\". This applied\nparticularly in the vicinity of\nembassies of countries such as Iraq\nwhere specific threats had been\nmade by terrorists.\nMr Reeves is hoping that there\nwill be an arrangement that no\nstunts which involve carrying guns,\nwearing balaclava s or blackening\nfaces, will take place outside the\nCollege campus.\nFree Friday November 28th No. 756\n\n"

I do not want to return to an\nargument which has so inelegantly\nfd led the FELIX letters page over\nrecent weeks, but it is impossible not\nto be struck by the irony of the\nsituation. Students Unions all over\nthe country have been campaigning\nagainst Barclaysfor years, and even\nthe most cynical observer would not\nuphold the Barclays statement that\nthe decision to sever links with South\nAfrica was made on economic\ngrounds only. The public feeling\ngenerated against the bank was the\nmajor factor. Here at Imperial\nCollege we 'almost had policy' on\nBarclays a couple of weeks before\nthey pulled out.\nBefore provoking another rabid\nselection of letters I should stress that\nI am not arguing over the crime any\nmore. The matter for concern is that\nit seems almost impossible for IC\nUnion to be mobilised into any\nconcerted political action. Many\nwould say that this is a good thing; I do not. Iam not attacking the famous IC apathy here. There are many\nstudents at this College who make full use of their free time, and are happy\nto support Union events. Rather,\nthere is a widespread phobia of\npolitical debate at Union level, and it\nis not because the student body is\ntruly 'apolitical'. Even the more\nliberal-thinking members of Council\ntend to come over as rather cynical,\nand I cannot avoid the conclusion that\nit is the burdens of internal\nadministration which effect many\npeople's attitudes. I can guarantee a post bag full of poison pen letters if I suggest that IC Union should a ffd i ate to the NUS; I shall suggest it anyway.\nThe ancient argument that the cost to\nthe Union, in terms of the inevitable\ncutting of clubs, is too high a price just doesn't wash. If it costs the Union a couple of high spending clubs, then so\nbe it; it is not un affordable if ICU\ndecides it has an opinion to express.\nFELIX\nThere will not be an issue of FELIX\nnext Friday (December 5th), nor on\nFriday December 12th. Instead there\nwill be a Christmas issue on\nWednesday 10th. Hopefully this will\nbe an extra-large FELIX, and there\nwill be a staff meeting today at\n12.30pm to discuss articles for this\nissue.

She\npointed out that the Union would\nbenefit from the move in any future\ndebate on rejoining the NUS.\nA delegate is also being sent to the\nWorld University Service (WUS)\nconference on the 16th and 17th December. The WUS is supported\nby Imperial which holds a number\nof collections on its behalf. The\nservice provides financial help for\nforeign students to study in the UK\nand Europe.\nSelf-Defence\nA specially designed self-defence\ncourse for women is being held in\nthe Union Dining Hall. Twelve\nstudents are being trained for three\nweeks by special police, to be able to\ndefend themselves against attackers.\nIt is hoped that more courses will be-run in the future.\nOnly Two Turn Up\nOnly two people turned out to\ncollect for Voluntary Services\nOverseas last Saturday. The\ncollection, organised by RCSU Rag,\nwas cancelled due to lack of interest.\nIt was hoped that the collection, the\nonly street collection of Rag Week,\nwould raise in the region of \u00a31,000.\nRCSU VP, Judith Hackney,\nexpressed disappointment at the\nlack of collectors, blaming it on the\nRag & Drag Disco which took place\non the previous evening and left\nmany people in bed on Saturday\nmorning unable to make it to\nSouthside for 10.00 am. There was\nalso some uncertainty as to the date\nof the event, many people believing\nthe collection to have been on the\nprevious Saturday. Ms. Hackney\ndismissed this as being the major\ncause of the lack of response as\n\"most, if not all, of the posters had\nthe new dates written on them\".\nThere is a similar stunt proposed\nfor next term on another VSO\nlicence.\nBad Teeth All Round\nA211b solid chocolate sculpture\ntitled \"after all, chocolate is our\nbread and butter\" by Colin\nWillroum, which was cast by\nRowntree Mackintosh pic for the\nrecent 'Art, Science and Industry\nExhibition' has been kindly donated\nby Rowntree to be raffled for\ncharity.\nProceeds of the raffle will be used\nto provide new toys for the Day\nNursery in 8, Prince's Gardens.\nTickets will be available from the\nNursery, the Reception of the\nHealth Centre, 14, Prince's Gardens, and the Messengers Desk,\nEntrance Hall, Sherfield Building,\nat lOp per ticket or 50p for 6 tickets.\nOrganisers: Jacqueline Faridian\n(Health Centre) and David Price\n(Safety Unit)\nTickets go on sale today, and the\ndraw will be made on Friday\nDecember 19th. For further\ninformation contact Jacqueline\nFaridian or David Price.\nMemorial Tree\nAn unusual tree was planted in\nCollege grounds on Tuesday in\nmemorial of an ex-student. The tree,\na Ginkgo Biloba (maidenhair tree),\nis a deciduous conifer and was\nchosen due to the long history ofthe\nspecies on this planet, fossil remains\nhaving been found in coal measures.\nThe responses at the ceremony were\ntaken by Dr. Findlay's son. The\nDoctor's wife smoothed the earth\naround the tree after a speeches by a member of the British Wood\nPreservation Association. It is\nhoped the tree will become an\nornament to the Imperial\nenvironment.\nNo Freedom\nOpposition peers will fight the\nfreedom of speech clause in the\nEducation Bill next week. They\nbelieve that there has been too little\ntime for discussion fo the\namendment. This section of the Bill\nwould outlaw any kind of 'no\nplatform' policy at educational\ninstitutions, giving any group the\nright to speak on any subject at any\nmeeting. Staff are concerned to\nknow whether the Local Authority\nor the educational institutes will be\nresponsible for the campus.\n\n"

Obviously, IC Film Society\nwill not be looking towards this\nextreme end - Southampton has\n\u00a34,000 of projection and sound\nequipment,our facilities are rather\nmore limited. Anything, though, is a start. With a bit of time, effort, and\nenthusiasm, who knows what might\nhappen?\nThe first Film Society event will\nbe a screening of 'Clockwise' on\nThursday 4th December at 7.45 pm\n(doors open 7.30 pm) in Physics\nLT1, and everyone is welcome.\nTickets will be \u00a31 and are available\nbeforehand or on the door.\n'Clockwise', starring John Cleese, is\na recent masterpiece' of British\ncomedy, and definitely well worth\nseeing. Please come along - this\nevent must pay for itself, since Film\nSociety has no proper Union\nsubsidy this year, and if you want a Film Society to show the films you\nwant to see next term, you must give\nit your support.\nIf you have any ideas, or would\nlike to help run Film Society,\ncontact Richard Squire via Elec.\nEng UG pigeonholes. Otherwise,\ncome along on Thursday, where I will discuss the future of the Film\nSociety with those people interested\nafter the show.\nConsoc\nLobby\nLast Friday, fifteen members of IC\nConsoc visited the Houses of\nParliament on invitation of our\nlocal MP (Mr. Peter Brook). The\nGroup watched the closing twenty\nminutes of a debate in the House of\nCommons, on AIDS. The chamber\nonly appears to hold 400 or so MP's( so where do the rest of our\nill us tiro us leaders spend their days?)\nThere followed a tour of the\nPalace of Westminster beginning\nwith the Chamber of the House of\nLords.\nThis intricately decorated room\nprovides the luxurious setting for\nthe state opening of Parliament. The\ngroup then moved into the House of\nCommons where attempts to\noccupy the front benches were\nthwarted by ever mindful police.\nSecurity microphones hang down\nfrom the ceiling, making MP's speeches audible throughout the\nchamber-even in public galleries\nwatching from above with no need\nfor shouting /banging of fists etc.\nThe tour finished in Westminster\nHall, the oldest part of the complex.\n(Having survived bombing\nattempts, air raids, fires and floods).\nThe original lice ridden woodwork\nis till standing, and the vast hall has\nbeen the scene of many great show-trials through history including\nCharles I and Sir Thomas More.\nThe visit finished mid-afternoon\nleaving some of the group at a loose\nend until opening time. It is our plan\nto make the visit an annual event.\nBible Bashing Ents\nTHE BIBLE (King James Version)\nprophesies the sound of weeping,\nwailing and gnashing of teeth. The\nBible! (Hewerdine-Shepherd\nVerson) signifies the hearing of\ncelestial harmonies allied to a heathen beat...\"Patti Smith's 'Horses', Televisions's 'Marquee\nMoon'...now add to the list of greats\nThe Bible! 'Walking the Ghost back\nHome'....(Music Week)\" \"The\nfreshest pop sound I 've heard so far\nthis year\" (Melody Maker).\nSee them live in the Lounge on\nFriday 28th November (tonight,\nobviously) with support from The\nFleshpuppets and disco 'til late, at\n8.30 pm, only \u00a31.50.\nOrchestra\nConcert\nOnce again we approach the end of\nthe first term, and what better way\nto celebrate this occasion than to go\nto the Orchestra Concert (Friday\n28th November, 8pm in Great\nHall)?\nThe programme, ambitious as\never, includes Saint-Saens' Organ\nSymphony, providing an occasion\nto use the new Great Hall organ to\nits full potential. This triumphant\nwork has been an inspiration for\nmore 'popular' works in recent\nyears, so why not come and try to\n'Name that tune'?\nAlso in the programme is Bruch's first violin concerto. The soloist,\nHideko Udagawa, is performing the\nsame work with the London\nSymphony Orchestra at the\nBarbican in February, so we look\nforward to a truly spectacular\nrendition of this beautiful piece.\nThere will, of course, be a bar\nopen at the interval and after the\nconcert in the JCR, so come to\nGreat Hall for a spectacularly, nay\nsensationally, entertaining evening.\nJazz Club\nBuzzing\nThe Jazz and Rock Club is buzzing\nwith brilliant bands right now. They\nare showing that they can contribute\nsignificantly to the entertainment\nscene around the College and\nintercollegiate halls. Recently,\n\"Stagefright\" and \"Blue Blue Ice\"\nappeared in Rag Week events\nincluding, the Smoking Concert and\nRag and Drag. So too did\n\"Schroedinger's Cat\", a folk band\nfrom Physics, who are also reputed\nto play in the Pearly Queen in\nWhitechapel. \"H2S04\" deserve a mention since they are a new band\nto the College, making their first\nEuropean appearance at SCAB\nNITE and snowing that they can\nadd a new dimension to Pink\nFloyd's \"Another brick in the wall.\"\nLook out for this three-piece from\nthe Middle East.\nThose of you who were anywhere\nnear Beit Quad last Saturday will\nhave witnessed \"Bert and the\nFamily Scrogg and the Scrogetts\"(!)\nthumping out their lively beat music\nto a packed snack bar. Meanwhile\nthe \"Beat Bandits\" are boasting a new horn section ready for their first\ngig this year.\nBut what of the jazz in Jazz and\nRock? I hear you ask. The list of\njazz-related bands is almost as long\nits rock counterpart, \"The Good,\nthe Trad and the Ugly\" are a competent 5 piece who offer their\nservices on business cards while the\nestablished jazz club traditional jazz\nband (as yet nameless, Jon Wood!)\ncan be seen at various times around\nthe College on special occasions.\n\"Chaz'n 'Dave\" (where did you get\nyour name from) are still going and\nI suspect should now be called\n\"Chaz'n 'Dave'n 'somebody else\".\nPractising on Thursdays, the \"Big\nBand\" represents a partnership of\njazz and rock, covering such songs\nas \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" and \"In\nthe mood\" (Glen Miller).\nI have tried to include all the\nbands that I know of and I'm sorry if\nI have missed any out. The really\nimportant news is that a selection of\nthe bands above will be playing in a special night of music on Thursday\n4th December-the \"Jazz and Rock\nClub Christmas Hop\". This will be\nan absolutely capital event with\nsomething for everyone. Look out\nfor advance tickets at \u00a31.00.\nLatest news of the Christmas\n...Sandie Shaw plus her backing\nband, who coincidentally are Joboxers all (remember Boxer-beat,\nanyone?) will be on stage early, so\ndon't hang around outside or you'll\nmiss...\nZeke Manyika and Dr. Love.\nZeke Manyika, ex-player with\nOrange Juice, The The, Style\nCouncil and Kate Bush, has a new\nbacking band consisting of\nmembers of The Cure, Hugh\nMasekela and Working Week - if he\ndoesn't sound good with that lot, he\nnever will!\nThe price is still only \u00a34.50, \u00a33.50\nwith ents card, in advance. The date\nis 8.30 prompt on Saturday 6th December. You'll also get free\nmince pies, disco until late, a bar\nuntil 2pm, and films like David\nBowie's 'The man who fell to earth'\nand a light Christmas fantasy story\n(and why not?). Hope to see you\nthere, and have a happy Christmas.\nRag Week has finally come to an\nend and things are beginning to get\nback to normal. The most successful\nevent of the twelve days had to be\nthe Beer Festival, raising nearly\n\u00a32,000. The only disappointment\nwas that only two people turned up\nto go collecting for VSO on\nSaturday (Well done Dave and\nMike). So we had to cancel the\nballoon-walking. It's a good stunt\nso we may try it again next term\nbecause we've got 3000 balloons\nleft.\nAs for the rest of the term, there's the R CSU Rag Mag being\nproduced, carol-singing in Covent\nGarden and the RCSU Rag\nChristmas Party on the 11th December.\nNext term we will be touring\nEngland again on the legendary\nRCSU Rag Mag Tours. The\nprovisional dates are Friday 16th Sunday 18th January for the South\nand West Tour, and Friday 30th January - Sunday l st( or Monday\n2nd) February for the Midlands and\nNorth Tour. Between these dates we\nwill probably do a mini-tour of the\nColleges within the University of\nLondon. If you fancy joining us on\ntour then note the dates in your\ndiary and leave a note in the RCSU\nOffice or physics pigeonholes for\nJudith Hackney with the tour you\nwish to join plus your name and\ndept.\nAlso watch out for the Rag Magthey will be available next term from\nthe RCSU Office.\n\n"
