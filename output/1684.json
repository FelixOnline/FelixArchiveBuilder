That\nis the question that Robert\nMenasse asked himself (in\n2010) and without further\nado moved to Brussels in\n2010 to find out about the\npeople who run the EU\nand to be at the heart of\na machinery that defines\na whole continent. The\nresult of all this was the\nnovel The Capital, which\nearned him the German\nBook Prize in 2017. It\ntruly is a unique novel,\nwhich circles around\nBrussels, Europe, nationalism and politics.\nBrussels is the heart\nof the European Union\nand it is also the heart of\nthe story. Actually, there\nare five different, loosely\nconnected stories, which\nrun parallel to each other.\nEach one has its own protagonists and sheds light\non everyday life in the\nEuropean capital from a\ndifferent perspective. The\ncentral story follows bureaucrat Martin Sussman\nwho works at the EU\ncommission\u2019s head office\nfor culture. His ambitious\nboss Fenia Xenopoulou,\na young Cypriot greek\nwoman,wantstoriseinthe\nhierarchy of the European\nCommission and is determined to demonstrate her\ncompetence by organising\na celebration to honour the\n60-year anniversary of the\nEuropean Commission.\nHowever, very soon all the\npeople involved in project\nhave to realize that things\ndon\u2019t come their way and\nthat there are some forces\nwithin the EU working\nagainst them, which they\ncannot control.\nAnother story follows\nDavid de Vriend, a Jewish\nAuschwitz survivor,\nwho has just moved into\na retirement home. He\nstruggles with the past\nand the present, especially\nas the past slowly slips\naway from his memory\nand he appears to be a\nlone survivor of a long\nlost past. The other three\nstorylines introduce the\nreader into the world\nof a polish hitman of\nthe Catholic church, a\nrenegade police officer\ntrying to solve a murder\ncase off his own bat and\na Viennese professor of\neconomics, who comes to\nthe realisation his generation born in the fifties and\nsixties is more revolutionary than today\u2019s youth.\nThese stories are perfectly\nchosen to provide a very\npersonal inside view of\nhow the EU and Brussels\nwork.\n\u201cMenasse is\nnot afraid\nto point his\nfinger at all\nthe political\nissues on\nthe Europen\ncontinent \u201d\n\u201cCaution \u2013 Tories can\ncontain traces of pork!\u201d\nThis is one of the many\npolitical references\nlittered all across the\nbook. Menasse is not\nafraid to point his finger at\nall the political issues on\nthe European continent.\nHe manages to span an\narc over nations, cultures\nand history, but at the\nsame time presents an\ninside view of the EU and\nits people with all their\nstrengths and weaknesses.\nA special role is played by\nBrussels itself, the place\nwhere the bulk of the story\ntakes place. There are\nhardly any descriptions of\nplaces in the book, instead\nstreets, squares and tube\nstations are just called by\ntheir name, which makes\nit hard for anybody who\nhas never travelled to\nBrussels to form a mental\nimage of the scenery.\nNevertheless, the one\nmental image of the city\nthat manifests itself is that\nof a huge mess, a maze of\nconstruction sites bathed\nin noise, where incessant\ndemonstrations and an\noverwhelming presence\nof the police create\nan atmosphere which\noccasionally resembles\ncivil war scenarios.\nBrussels is a modern day\nBabylon, where people\nfrom all over the conti-nent, speaking dozens of\ndifferent languages try\nto create something truly\ngreat in the midst of an\nenormous confusion.\nMenasse illustrates this\nby using characters from\na variety of backgrounds,\nrich, poor, old and young.\nHe throws quotes and\npassages in Polish, Greek,\nFrench, Dutch, Czech\nand many other European\nlanguages.\nOne symbol stands out\nabove all and runs through\nall the storylines: the pig.\nThe book starts with the\nmysterious sighting of a\npig roaming the streets\nof central Brussels. Like\na ghost the pig shows up\nagain and again. This pig,\nwhich is so out of place\nin a city like Brussels,\nbecomes a sensation,\nespecially as not even the\npolice are able to catch\nit. Menasse also uses the\npork industry to tell a\nstory about the dealings\nof agricultural lobbyists in\nthe EU.\nMenasse draws\nconcrete conclusions\nout of the current state\nof the Union, albeit not\nalways positive ones. It is\nparamount for the EU to\nimprove its public image\nand to reconnect with\nthe European population.\nHe puts a human face on\nthe European Union and\nattempts to build a bridge\nbetween the personal\nEurope, which we experience in our everyday\nlives, and the impersonal\ninstitution that is the\nEuropean Union. One of\nthe themes that define the\nbook is a recollection of\nthe original values of the\nEU, written down in the\nfounding contracts of the\nEuropean Commission,\nin particular the absolute\ndetermination to prevent\natrocities akin to the ones\nthat tore Europe apart in\nthe first half of the 19th\ncentury from happening\nagain. Menasse urges the\nreader to think carefully\nabout the past, the present\nand the future and to\nnot be blinded by short\nsighted interests. The\nfuture can be bright, if we\ndon\u2019t forget the past.\nRobert Menasse, author of The Capital and resident of Brussels // DPA\n\n"

The\nHackathon is essentially\nthe culture that built the\ntechnological titans of\ntoday - Facebook, Google\nand Microsoft. And the\nannual hackathlon organised by DocSoc keeps up\nthat spirit with IC Hack\n18, which returned bigger\nand better than ever.\nIC Hack 18 only saw\nthe list of sponsors grow,\nwith Microsoft being\nthe title sponsor. Over\n300 students, both from\nImperial and other universities got together to\ncome up with something\ncool, something neat,\nsomething awesome. The\nonly condition was that\nthey had only 24 hours\nto work on their projects.\nSome (including me)\nwere participating for the\nfirst time, whilst others\nwere regulars.\nGracing the opening\nceremony was Theo\nBlackwell, London\u2019s first\nChief Digital Officer.\nHe shared about his role\nin realising the Mayor\u2019s\nambition to make London\nthe world\u2019s smartest city,\nensuring that the capital\u2019s\nstatus as a global tech\nhub helps transform the\nway public services are\ndesigned and delivered,\nmaking them more\naccessible, efficient and\nresponsive to the needs of\nLondoners.\nAt the end of the\nOpening Ceremony, after\nall the sponsors had shared\nabout their companies and\nwhat they do, the hacking\nbegan.\nThe designated hacking\nspaces were all over Sherfield Building, and groups\noccupied the Senior\nCommon Room, Junior\nCommon Room and the\namong participants were\nthe Crepes, Waffles and\nCandy Floss stalls that set\nup on Saturday evening.\nNolessimpressivewere\nthe several workshops\nthat were held over the\nweekend - when participants weren\u2019t busy trying\nto fix their code, they were\nkept busy by Microsoft\nteaching them how to\nuse their Azure Cognitive\nServices APIs, or hearing\nfrom Ocado Technology\n(a Gold Sponsor) about\nScala and functional pro-gramming. However, the\nmost popular workshop\ndidn\u2019t involve any fancy\nAPIs or even any code.\nNext Jump\u2019s Sleep Class\nwas by far the most\npopular workshop, with\ndemand so high that they\nhad to have a third run\nof the workshop to meet\nthe demand. Next Jump\nstaff walked participants\nthrough a 20 minute\nsession of Yoga Nidra,\nwhich left participants\nfeeling refreshed enough\nto keep them going for the\nQueen\u2019s Tower Rooms.\nThe energy started of\nreally high - with a variety\nof music blasting, thanks\nto the crowdsourced\nmusic suggestions that\nwas run using a Slack\nchannel.\nThe scale of IC Hack\nis hard to wrap your head\naround. How much drinks\ndoes it take to keep over\n300 students awake and\nactive for 24 continuous\nhours? Your guess is\nprobably nowhere near\nthe actual 2 tonnes of\ndrinks that was brought in\nfor the event. The amount\nof soft drinks is not as\nimpressive when you start\nconsidering the thousands\nspent on food - the menu\nfor the weekend included\nNando\u2019s, Domino\u2019s Pizza,\nPretAManger and Farmer\nJ. (Unconfirmed reports\nstate that American\nExpress called up one of\nthe organisers to confirm\nthat they did really use\ntheir credit card to spend\nover \u00a32000 on Nando\u2019s.)\nAlso highly popular\nrest of the long weekend.\nLater in the night, Morgan\nStanley hosted a Bar\nNight for the participants\nin the Imperial College\nUnion Bar for participants\nto take a break from\nsquashing bugs to social-ise and enjoy a free drink\non them.\nSo where did all the\nfood and the hundreds of\nRed Bull cans consumed\ngo? It went into some\nawe-inspired projects that\nsurprised both students\nand sponsors. The teams\nsubmitted the projects that\nthey worked tirelessly for\n24 hours on into different\ncategories, and 2 finalists\nfor each category were\nselected. Each finalist\ngroup then spent no more\nthan 2 minutes presenting\nand demonstrating their\nidea to the audience and\njudges, and the winning\nteam for each category\nwas chosen at the end of\nthe Hackathon.\ngame built with Queen\u2019s\nTower as it\u2019s primary\nsetting. Fascinatingly, all\nthe art used in the game\nwas drawn up by the team\nwithin those 24 hours,\nwhich was definitely a\nsurprising feat. Winning\nthe best Mobile Category\nApp was SugarHoneyIceTea, a hilariously\nnamed app that helped\nindividuals track their\nconsumption by asking\nthem to take pictures of\nthe food and drinks that\nthey consumed. Winning\nBest Game/Augmented\nReality Hack and taking\nhome Nintendo Switches\nwas iSpyAI (which I was\npart of), a hyperlocal AR\ntreasure-hunt game where\nmultiple players would\nrace to find objects in\ntheir immediate vicinity\nto gain points. There were\nalso sponsor-categories,\nsuch as the TPP Greatest\nImpact on Healthcare\ncategory and the Accenture best Ethical/For Good\nHack category.\nThe logistical sophistication and the level of organisation that IC Hack 18\nrequired to run smoothly\nwas well satisfied by\nDocSoc and it\u2019s volun-teers. Every event during\nthe weekend started on\ntime with very little\ndelays, and the smallest\ndetails weren\u2019t left untouched (toothbrushes,\nslippers and blankets were\nprovided for participants\nwho wanted to catch\nsome sleep during the\nweekend). The cooperation of the sponsors and\nthe impressive lengths\nDocSoc went to make\nthis event smooth-running\nwas evident from how enjoyable IC Hack was. As a\nfirst-time participant at IC\nHack 18, I truly applaud\nthe spirit behind the\nevent, and I only wish that\nDocSoc organises more\nsuccessful hackathons\nover the years.\nExhaustion crept in as most worked around the clock to put their ideas into practice // Tom Mrazek\n\u201cThe scale of\nIC Hack is hard\nto wrap your\nhead around\u201d\nTaking home 3D\nPrinters was FPS Galloper\n3000, the winner for The\nBest Hardware Hack\ncategory. They used Microsoft\u2019s Kinect to build\na motion-controlled way\nto play Counter-Strike.\nWinning the Best\nNewcomer\u2019s Hack was\nFeedbacker, an app that\nuses Microsoft\u2019s Emotion\nRecognition Service to\ngauge the excitement\nlevel of the audience\nduring a lecture, using it\nto provide feedback to\nthe lecturer. Winning The\nBest Web App category\nwas Queen\u2019s Treasure,\nwhich is a web-based\ninteractive adventure\nThe future of medicine \u2013 edible QR codes?\n\u201cData about\nthe medicine\nand dosage\ncan be stored\nin the pill\nitself\u201d\nI\nf you are ill, chances\nare you would book\nan appointment\nwith your doctor.\nThey would listen to\nyour heartbeat, do some\ntests and then prescribe\nsome medicines based on\nyour symptoms. A trip\nto your local pharmacy\nwould result in a bag full\nof medications, some of\nwhich being the ones that\nyour doctor prescribed\nand some that you were\ntold worked in the same\nway as the prescribed\nmedicines that weren\u2019t in\nstock. A week or two into\nthe treatment, you might\nrealize that you are still\nsick - the antibiotics don\u2019t\nwork. You aren\u2019t alone -many people around the\nworld face this problem.\nThiscouldbebecauseof\nmany reasons. One reason\nis the overuse and misuse\nof antibiotics. Some types\nof bacteria, single-celled\nliving organisms, cause\nmany bacterial infections.\nAntibiotics are effective\nagainst such infections\nbecause they kill the\nbacteria by stopping their\ngrowth and reproduction.\nNowadays, people are\nmisusing antibiotics by\nover consuming them or\nnot taking medicines for\nthe full duration of the\ntreatment. This results in\nthe bacteria developing\nresistance against the\nantibiotic, rendering it\nuseless.\nAlso, it is possible that\nthe prescribed drug just\ndoesn\u2019t work as effectively as it does in other\npeople due to genetic or\nenvironmental factors\napart from the overcon-sumption of drugs. This is\nwhy scientists are looking\ntowards medications that\nare personalized to an in-dividual, so that the illness\ncan be treated properly\nand more accurately than\nit is now.\nAnother reason is the\nconsumption of \u2018fake\u2019\nmedicines in developing\ncountries, which could\ncontain incorrect doses,\nwrong ingredients or no\nactive ingredients at all.\nEven some authorized\nmedicines fall in this\ncategory because they fail\nto meet quality standards.\nThis might be due to\nimproperstorage,amongst\nother issues. According\nto the World Health\nOrganization (WHO),\nthese bogus medications\nare a growing threat as\nincreased pharmaceutical\ntrade, including via the\ninternet, allows opportunities for fake drugs to\nbe distributed. National\nhealth organizations are\ntrying to find ways to stop\nthe spread of these drugs.\nScientists and engineers\nare trying to find different\ntypes of solutions towards\nmore personalized medications and combating the\ndistribution of fake drugs.\nLast Friday, a research\ngroup from University\nof Copenhagen and Abo\nAkademi University in\nFinland shared how they\ncreated a new way to\nindividualize treatment\n- printing medicines in\nquick response (QR) code\npatterns onto an edible\nmaterial.\nlike websites, emails and\ntexts. They were invented\nin Japan by Denso Wave\nIncorporated to address\nthe main limitation of\nbarcodes - only being\nable to hold around 20\nalphanumeric characters\nof information. After it\nwas developed, it was first\nused by the automobile\nindustry. Now, engineers\nare testing medicines\nprinted in that pattern.\nThe medicines were\nprinted using inkjet\nprinting (IJP) technology\nto allow for greater flexibility in manufacturing\ndoses tailored to each\nindividual. The ink used\nhad the active pharmaceutical ingredient and it was\nprinted in the pattern of a\nQR code onto a newly developed porous, flexible,\nedible and mechanically\nstable substrate with a\ngood absorption capacity.\nThe mechanical properties\nof the substrate weren\u2019t\naffected by the printing\nprocess. The QR code had\ngood print definition and\nit didn\u2019t have significant\nedge bleeding.\nProfessor Jukka\nRantanen working in the\nDepartment of Pharmacy\nsaid: \u201cIf we are successful\nwith applying this production method to relatively\nsimple printers, then it can\nenable the innovative production of personalized\nmedicine and rethinking\nof the whole supply\nchain,\u201d\nDue to the shape of the\nQR code, data about the\nmedicine and dosage can\nbe stored in the pill itself.\nUsing an app, a quick scan\nof the QR code would\ngive all the information\nabout the pharmaceutical\nproduct, which could\npotentially reduce cases\nof wrong or fake medication being used. The QR\ncodes are still readable by\nsmartphones even if the\npills are stored in harsh\nconditions.\nResearchers hope that,\nin the future, the medical\ndrug can be applied in\nthe pattern of a QR code\nonto the edible material\nusing a regular printer,\nwhile the material would\nbe produced in advance\nto allow on-demand\nproduction of drugs. Not\nonly does the technology\ntake a giant step towards\npersonalized medicine, it\nalso proposes a feasible\nsolution to the problem\nof fake drugs. Should\nthis technology be refined\nand used on a widespread\nbasis, informed decisions\ncan be made from the\npatient\u2019s side in taking\neffective medication in\nthe future.\nEdible QR codes can definitely be tasty, but can they help too?// The Land and Water co.\nTECH\nKrithika Balaji\nTech Writer\n\u201cA week or\ntwo into the\ntreatment, you\nmight realize\nthat you are\nstill sick\u201d\nQR codes are a type of\ntwo-dimensional barcode\nthat are read using a smartphone or other devices\nprogrammed to read\nit. These devices, after\nreading the code, connect\ndirectly to other things\nCould the humble QR code form part of the medicine of tomorrow?\n\n"

But\nwhat made\nthis week a bit different\nwas the return of one of\nmy favourite parts of this\ntime of year: daffodils.\nWhen I was passing a\npetrol station on the way\nhome last week, I noticed\nbunches upon bunches of\ndaffodils, their flowers\npressed tightly closed\nagainst the roar of traffic,\nstanding upright in a\nbucket, like regimented\nsoldiers. I bought a bunch,\nwhich have been slowly\nblooming on my desk as I\ntype up articles.\nI don\u2019t know why I like\ndaffodils so much, but it\nmight be because they are\nreassuring. We know they\nare coming, every single\nyear \u2013 and yet, when they\ndo finally appear, they\nstill seem to be something\nof a surprise. This is my\nsixth year at Imperial, so\nstudent elections have\nbecome a bit like these\ndaffodils too \u2013 regular\nand expected, although\nnot as pretty. This is the\nfirst year where I\u2019ve really\nbeen involved with the\nelections, though, or with\nthe Union as a whole.\nWhile I\u2019ve been involved\nwith Felix since coming to\nImperial, it\u2019s never been\nwith an eye to checking\nout what\u2019s going on at the\nUnion, or seeing what the\nCollege has invested.\nThis year has provided\nsomething of a rude intro-duction, therefore, into the\nworld of Union hackery.\nWhile I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve not\nenjoyed having a peek\ninside the inner workings\nof Imperial, I think a year\nwill be enough for me \u2013\ndon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll only\nhave to put up with these\nfor a few more months.\nThis issue we\u2019re looking\nat something that I\u2019ve\nbeen thinking about since\nI ran for the role: how we\nhold our elected officials\naccountable. Each year\nwe elect a set of officer\ntrustees, who all run on\nmanifesto promises; and\neach year they end their\nterm with a list of things\nthey have achieved,\nwhich \u2013 though admirable\n\u2013 is often different to what\nthey set out to do.\nWhile they\u2019ve still got\nquite a bit of time left to\ndo things, we thought\nthis week would be a\ngood time to check in\nwith what they\u2019ve been\nup to, perhaps giving\npotential candidates an\nidea of the kind of things\nOfficer Trustees might\ndo on a day to day basis.\nWe\u2019ll be doing another\none at the end of the year,\nwhen time\u2019s really up, to\nsee what\u2019s fallen by the\nwayside.

I won\u2019t blame you.\nAs I said, Union hackery\nisn\u2019t for everyone.\nWhen I first started\nthis role, I was expecting\nthe most exciting and rewarding aspects of the job\nwould be holding people\nto account, and reporting\non the news that really\nmatters to you. While\nthat\u2019s still hugely important to me, what I\u2019ve come\nto realise is the part of the\njob I find so incredible\nis getting to work with\nthe group of wonderful\nindividuals who make up\nthe Felix team.

The average\nhearing threshold for a\nyoung adult lies between\n18 to 20 kHz, but can fall\nto as low as 15 to 16 kHz\ndue to long exposure to\nsound above 85 decibels.\nAt full volume, a typical\nearphone can reach above\n100 decibels, able to cause\nlong-term damage to the\near after exposures of just\n15 minutes.\nOver-ear IEMs (in ear\nmonitors) differ from\nyour \u201cregular\u201d earphones\nby being worn with the\ncable going over around\nthe back of the ear and\ninserted deeper into the\near compared to earpods\nor regular earphones,\nwhich sit at the opening of\nthe ear canal. This comes\nwith several benefits:\nDepending on the tip,\na well fitting over-ear\nIEM can reach between\n30-40 decibels of noise\nisolation, reducing the\nnoise of a car going at\n50 mph (~ 70 dB) to the\nambient noise of an empty\nroom (~ 40dB). While\nANC (active noise-can-celling) headphones can\nalso achieve this, they are\nbulkier, require charging,\nand work best with\n\u201cwhite\u201d noise; constant\nnoise such as the sound\nof a plane engine. They\nare much less effective\nagainst sudden changes,\nsuch as loud conver-sations, whereas IEMs\nreduce all noise equally\nby physically blocking\nyour ear canal.\nDue to the noise\nisolation, IEMs allow\nyou to listen to music at\nlower volumes, thereby\nreducing the risk of ear\ndamage. Volumes at 70\ndecibels and below are\nrated safe for constant\nexposure, but as typical\nadvice, it is recommended\nthat you turn down the\nvolume as low as possible\nwhile still being able to\nbe noticeable in critical\nlistening, this difference\nis extremely obvious\nin certain songs (for\nexample Lorde \u201cRoyals\u201d\nand Hans Zimmer \u201cWhy\nso serious?\u201d).\nMany new models\ncomewithmodularcables,\nallowing a replacement if\nthey are damaged. They\ncan also be attached to a\nbluetooth module to turn\nthem into wireless IEMs.\nHowever with all their\nbenefits, over-ear IEMs\nalso come with certain\ndrawbacks:\nGetting a proper fit can\nbe difficult and time-con-suming, but usually it is\neasy to tell when you have\nachieved it, as the amount\nof noise isolation and\nsound clarity jumps to a\nnew level. To achieve this,\ndifferent tips may have to\nbe tried until the best one\nis found. A popular (but\nmore expensive) option\nis using memory foam\ntips (In the below picture,\n3rd from left), which\ncompress to fit in the ear\nand then expand to fill\nthe ear canal. These often\ncome standard with higher\nend IEMs. Some IEMs\nmay also be too physically\nlarge for smaller ears and\nthis can be difficult to tell\nwhen purchasing online.\nA deep fit using triple\nflanges (below, 3rd from\nright) may be uncomfortable to those with sensitive\nears, and a shallower fit\nwill provide a smaller\n(but still good) amount of\nnoise isolation.\nhear the music.\nReduction of \u201cmicrophonics\u201d, which are the\nvibrations transmitted\nthrough the wire of your\nearphones when they are\nmoved, resulting in those\nannoying rustling noises.\nBy wearing IEMs over\nthe ear, the vibrations\nare dampened by a great\namount.\nImproved sound\nquality can be achieved\nwith a proper fit. The\nwavelengths of frequencies in the range of 10 to\n13 kHz are short enough\nthat acoustic resonance\ncan occur between the\nearphone output and\neardrum when inserted\ninsufficiently deep,\ncausing the symptom\nknown as \u201csibilance\u201d (a\nharsh spike in volume\nat higher frequencies).\nIn addition, subbass (the\nrumble at frequencies\n< ~100 Hz) quantity is\ngreatly improved by a\nproper seal. For example,\nthe apple earpods lose\nup to 25 decibels in the\nsubbass due to their more\nopen design. Given that a\nchange in 2-3 decibels can\nPersonally over the\nlast 6 months I have been\nusing the Shure SE846\n(RRP: \u00a3829) along with\ndual-flange silicone tips\n(below, 2nd from the left),\nresulting in incredible\nnoise isolation and sound\nquality on the go. Without\ngoing too much into the\ntechnical details, the\nspecial feature of these\nIEMs is that they have\ncertain technology which\nallows a clearer delivery\nof sounds below 90Hz,\nresulting in a feeling of\nhaving miniature sub-woofers inserted into your\nears, in addition to filters\nwhich can vary the sound\nby a small amount.\nWhen they are properly\nin place:\n\u2022 The ambient noise\nof an empty room sounds\n\u201cloud\u201d in comparison\n\u2022 With music\nplaying, a busy street is\ninaudible, and the underground is barely audible.\nPlane noise is virtually\ninaudible and only the\nvibration can be felt.\n\u2022 Roads have to\nbe triple checked before\ncrossing.\n\u2022 Annoyed parents\nhave to be dealt with for\nnot responding to calls\nacross the room.\nNow, good IEMs don\u2019t\nhave to cost an arm and\nleg, as they can range\nfrom as little as \u00a310 to\nas much as \u00a33000. At a\npremium cost, you can\nalso get IEMs that are\ncustom silicone moulded\nto the shape of your ear,\nfor increased comfort.\nHowever, these require\na visit to the Audiologist\nand can take weeks to\nmake and deliver, and\nmay not fit anymore\nwithin a few years as the\nears are still growing and\nchanging in the majority\nof young adults.\nSeveral companies in\nthe past year have been\nworking on creating 3D\nprinted custom moulds\nout of 3D scans, or even\nphone pictures, in order\nto speed up the process,\nbut this is still a relatively\nnew technology.\nIf you\u2019ve come this far,\nand are willing to give up\na few days worth of coffee\nfor an improved listening\nexperience, unfortunately\nthere are few universal\nrecommendations. Each\nperson\u2019s sound and fit\npreferences vary. It can\nbe worth visiting one of\nLondon\u2019s audio shops\nand see what they have in\nstore to demo.\nOtherwise, many new\nbrands from China have\nbeen offering great value\nIEMs for around \u00a310 to\n\u00a330, but delivery from\nAliexpress can take a few\nweeks.

Woman\naggressively dealt with\nthe softer parts of life and\nlove. Bold in its message,\nbut delivered with a fragile\ngentleness, almost soft to\nthe touch; Woman did little\nto avoid the comparisons\nto Sade.

Music you could,\nwithout much thought,\nnod your head along to\nin moments of vacuous\nserenity, with little to\nno engagement of any\ncritical faculties.

Lage\nthrows up strange chord\nvoicings and makes great\nmelodic jumps in rapid\nsuccession, stopping only\nfor an incidental bend or\narpeggio, before whisking\naway on yet another\nlovely jaunt deep into the\nrealms of music theory I\ndon\u2019t understand.\nColley and Wollesen\nare no slouches either.\nYou might recognize\nthem: Wollesen has toured\nwith Tom Waits, Norah\nJones, and Sex Mob,\nwhile Colley has spent\ntime with Herbie Hancock\nand Jim Hall.

When I\nwas in LA, I went to the\nJimmy Kimmel Live show\nand it was indeed one of\nthe highlights of my trip!\nSomewhat surprisingly,\nyou can\u2019t really buy tickets\nto such shows \u2013 instead,\nyou enter a competition\nby registering your details\nonline and telling them\nwhy you\u2019d like to win.\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll\nreceive the tickets to your\nemail account for free.\nWe applied for a couple\nof shows on different\ndays and won 2 tickets to\nJimmy Kimmel Live, but\nonly found out the line\nup a few days before the\nrecording \u2013 actor Larry\nDavid and animal trainer\nDave Salmoni.\nOn the day of the\nshow, we received an\nemail saying we had\nbeen upgraded to priority\ntickets. That meant we\nwere one of the first\npeople to enter the venue,\nwhich is located in the\nvery centre of the Hollywood Boulevard, with\nJimmy Kimmel\u2019s star\njust at its doorsteps. As\nwe were waiting outside\nin the queue, the staff\nmembers approached us\none by one to check our\ntickets and explained\nsome basic rules \u2013 from\nthe moment we entered\nthe venue, taking pictures\nor videos was strictly\nprohibited. We were also\nasked to leave our bags\nat the entrance. Besides\nthe priority and regular\nticket holders, there were\nseveral people without\ntickets, waiting to join the\naudience should any seats\nremain unfilled.\nUpon entering the\nactual studio, the audience\nmembers were seated by\nthe crew based on their\npreference.Therulesofthe\nshow were then explained,\nand we soon realized\nthat all the clapping\nand chanting from the\naudience is staged: we\nwere asked to follow two\nsigns \u2013 \u201cApplause\u201d and\n\u201cStop clapping\u201d \u2013 that\nwere hanging from the\nceiling and would light\nup throughout the show.\nWhen Kimmel entered the\nstage, our clapping and\nshouting was supposed\nto be so loud that it was\nimpossible to hear him\nfor the first 15 seconds.\nWe were then asked to\ngradually fade out when\nthe \u201cStop Clapping\u201d sign\nlit up, rather than ending\nsuddenly, to make it sound\nmore realistic on TV.\nBell, who was helping out\nelderly people who had\nbeen relocated from a retirement home to her hotel\nin Florida. News reports\non the hurricane were\nthen shown, before Jimmy\nmoved on to interviewing\nthe guests \u2013 Larry David\nintroduced his upcoming\nTV series, while Dave\nSalmoni brought some\nextra-venomous snakes,\nand a few other animals.\nDuring one of the breaks\nbetween filming, Kimmel\nremained on stage and\nhad an off-the-record\nconversation with an\naudience member who\nhad fled Florida to escape\nthe hurricane. He seemed\ngenuinely interested and\nconcerned with the situa-tion. During other breaks,\nanother crew member\nchatted with the audience,\nkeeping us entertained\nby asking questions and\ngiving out some prizes.\nFinally, after the show,\nwe were invited to listen to\nthe rapper 21 Savage, who\nperformed on the stage\noutside the studio. Not\nbeing huge fans, we left\nafter two songs, but there\nwere people outside the\nvenue, peeping through\nthe holes in the fence and\ntrying to get a glimpse of\nthe performance.\nIt was very interesting to see how such\nsuccessful shows work,\nwith everything being\ncarefully planned, down\nto the last detail. It was\nalso surprising to realise\nthat the show needed\nthe audience more than\nthe audience needed\nthe show. So if you\u2019re\ninterested in showbiz or\nfind yourself in LA with\n\u2018nothing to do\u2019, I would\nstrongly recommend\nvisiting one of these talk\nshows \u2013 you\u2019ll get a sneak\npeek of how things work\nbackstage and might even\nsee some of your favourite celebrities.

Researchers\nare therefore keen to understand how these cells\ncommunicate in order to\ndevelop novel tools to\ndefeat cancer.\nA recent breakthrough\nwas reported by a group\nin Germany, where they\nfound Hedgehog signalling was required for the\nsurvival of colon CSC.\nWhilst the name\nHedgehog signalling may\nremind you of cute household pets, in developmental biology it is known\nto be a crucial cellular\ncommunication method\nthat regulates cell growth,\ndevelopment, and tissue\nhomeostasis. In fact, the\nmajor signalling molecule\nin this pathway, Hedgehog\n(Hh), was named by the\nscientists who discovered\nthat the larvae of fruit\nflies that lack (Hh) had an\nabnormal spiny appear-ance. This highlights the\nHedgehog\u2019s role in development across species, as\nwell as the lack of creativity among scientists!\nAnother important\nsignalling pathway is\ncalled Wingless-related\nintegration (WNT). In\nthe intestine, WNT helps\nto maintain the plasticity\nor \u2018potency\u2019 of intestinal\nstem cells, allowing these\ncells to replace dead intestinal cells with new ones.\nGiven the importance\nof WNT and Hedgehog\nsignalling in both development and stem cell\nmaintenance, it is not\nsurprising that mutations\nin WNT signalling can be\nfound in 90% of colorectal cancers. Unexpectedly,\nHedgehog genes are not\nmutated in most cases,\nbut are often upregulated,\nsuggesting that both WNT\nand Hedgehog signalling\nplay a major role in the\nprogression of colon\ncancer.\nBased on this hy-pothesis, researchers in\nGermany used cancer\norganoid models, a 3D\nculture of tumour cells\nobtained from patients,\nto study the relationship\nbetween these pathways\nand colon CSC.\nBy comparing the gene\nT\nhis year,\nImperial College\nNeuroscience\nSociety held its\nfourth annual conference\n\u2013 \u2018Meeting of the Minds\u2019\n\u2013 hosting prestigious clinicians and neuroscientists\nfrom across the UK.

Having commenced\na BSc in Neuroscience at\nUCL in 2014, I have been\nfollowing this conference\nsince its inception. On\nevery occasion it explores\ncurrent themes, with many\nstudents having the opportunity to watch a live\nbrain dissection by the\nexceptionally experienced\nProfessor Steve Gentleman. This year\u2019s themes\nincluded neurodegener-ation, neuroadaptation,\npaediatric neurology, and\nmany more.\nThe day started with\na warm welcome at\nregistration from the committee of Imperial College\nNeuroscience Society,\nand a keynote speech\non primary progressive\naphasia from Professor\nPeter Garrard. Later in the\nday, Imperial\u2019s own Dr\nAmin Hajitou discussed\ndelivery of genes to the\nCNS to help treatment\nof neurodegenerative\ndiseases and cancers such\nas glioblastoma. To date,\nmethods employing ret-roviruses, adenoviruses,\nadeno-associated viruses,\nand herpes-simplex virus\nhave had significant\nlimitations. However, Dr\nHajitou described why\nthe use of bacteriophages\nmay be a more favourable\napproach. Bacteriophages\nare viruses which only\ninfect bacteria and are\nfound in water and food\noffering us protection.\nThey can naturally cross\nthe blood-brain barrier,\nand once they have\ncleared their target they\nare removed by microglia.\nThey work by targeting\na ligand, and can be\nmanipulated for selectivity to various molecules.\nThe talk finished with\na poignant quote: \u2018the\nenemy of my enemy is my\nfriend\u2019.\nThe second part of\nthe day hosted a choice\nof several speakers,\nincluding Dr Patrick\nGrover from the National\nHospital for Neurology\nand Neurosurgery, and\nDr Bianca Jupp from\nCambridge University.\nDr Grover discussed his\nresearch investigating\nfunctional and structural\nconnectivity (tractogra-phy) with implications\nin neurodegenerative\ndisease. His work has\ninvestigated the roles of\nthe brain\u2019s default mode\nnetwork (introspective)\nand the salience network\n(outside world). Dr Jupp\nspoke next about her\nresearch on the implication of impulsivity in\naddiction, elucidating\nwhich neurobiological\nfactors may influence this.\nDr Jupp\u2019s findings have\nimplicated D2 receptors,\nneuronal spine density,\nand myo-inositol as\nfactors, and have brought\nus one step closer to understanding the neurobiology beneath addiction.\nThese were a few of\nthe many talks on offer\nthroughout the day,\nending on a keynote\nspeech from Professor\nSven Bestmann from the\nUCL Sobell Department\nof Motor Neuroscience\nand Movement Disorders.\nProfessor Bestmann\nspoke about potential for\nprecision in non-invasive\nbrain stimulation, and the\nlack of disease specific\nmodels of stimulation.\nThis year\u2019s inspiring\nconference finished with\na relaxed networking\nsession. With so much\nto offer, this is an annual\nevent that is not to be\nmissed. We eagerly await\nto see which speakers will\nbe on the jam-packed programme next year.

By genetically knocking out the\ngene (PTCH-1) that is\ninvolved in non-canonical\nHedgehog signalling,\nthis group showed that\nnon-canonical PTCH-1\ndependent Hedgehog\nsignalling is necessary for\ncolon CSC survival. More\nimportantly, Hedgehog\ncontrols WNT signalling\nto maintain the pluripo-tency of CSC by inhibiting differentiation.\nThis is exciting because\nthese pathways could\npotentially be targets for\nfuture development of\nanticancer drugs. Furthermore, two independent\ngroups have already tried\nto target these pathways\nin Hedgehog-dependent\npancreatic and breast\ncancers cells in 2005, with\nsome degree of success \u2013\nproviding evidence for the\nfeasibility of this concept.\nThough we are still far\nfrom obtaining a cure,\nthere is still hope, and it\nwould also be interesting\nto see if this applies to\nother forms of cancer too!\nAn inner look at the working of the brain // Wikimedia\nSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nM\nost people\nare aware\nof the\na m a z i n g\nability dogs have to\nsniff out targeted items\nor substances they\nhave been trained for.\nAlthough more commonly known as \u2018sniffer\ndogs,\u2019 the correct term\nfor such trained canines\nis detection dogs. They\nare frequently used at\nairports and other international gateways to\ndetect illegal narcotics,\nbut may also be used to\ndetect explosives and\nother contraband that\nwe ourselves are unable\nto detect. Recently,\nhowever, there has\nbeen a growing use of\nsuch well-trained dogs\nto detect endangered\nspecies which have a low\ndetection probability. This\nhas worked well in the\ncase of certain amphibian\nspecies and can easily\nbe replicated across the\nboard for other such taxa.\nsity\u2019s African Amphibian\nConservation Research\nGroup have been investigating the potential use\nof detection dogs to find\nfossorial frog species.\nFossorial species pose a\nnumber of problems in\nterms of conservation\nparticularly when considering their low detection\nrates as they spend a\nmajority of time buried\nunderground, especially if\nthey live in a hostile envi-ronment. Using detection\ndogs was successfully\ntrialled recently to find\nmembers of the giant\nbullfrog \u2013 a species which\nis locally threatened.After\ntheir success they hope to\ntrain detection dogs to\nfind additional species\nand even to detect traces\nof diseases, which so far\nhave been promising!\nThere are examples\ncloser to home that\nhighlight the versatility\nof detection dogs, particularly for an infamous\namphibian species: the\ngreat crested newt is\nloathed by developers all\nover the country due to its\nlegal protection and the\nwork required to make\nsure they are moved out\nof harm\u2019s way when land\ndevelopments takes place.\nUnfortunately, when pond\nor terrestrial habitats containing newts are levelled,\nnot all of the individuals\ncan be removed. That\nis where detection dogs\ncome in! Recently, a\ncocker spaniel was used\nin Norwich to find newts\nstill lurking in potential\ncracks and crevices before\nthe construction of an important bypass. This effort\nproved quite successful\nand there are hopes that\nsimilar work will occur\nto help clear the way\nfor the proposed HS2\nroute.

The application of this technology is\nvast \u2013 from drug discovery\nto studying developmental biology. Not only can\nthese models reduce the\ncost of research, because\nfewer cells and reagents\nare needed, but they can\nalso decrease the number\nof animals required in\nresearch.\nA recent example of\nhow organ-on-chips can\nbe used is demonstrated\nby a multi-national group,\nwhich engineered blood\nvessels on silicon chips\nto understand the progression of cancer.\nCancer, similarly to you\nand I, requires oxygen and\nnutrients to grow. They\nsecrete chemicals into the\nlocal environment, which\ninduce new blood vessels\nto grow towards them\nthrough a process called\nangiogenesis, thereby\nbringing nutrition to their\ndoorstep. If we can understand the mechanism\nby which they feed them-selves, scientists may\nbe able to starve them to\ndeath.\nThis concept is old, and\navailable cancer drugs on\nthe market try to achieve\njust that, but their efficacy\nis disappointingly low.\nFurthermore, traditional\nmodels used to study\nblood vessel growth have\ntheir limits, and hence\nbetter models are needed\nfor developing new therapies against cancer.\nA microvessel-on-chip\nhas been devised for this\npurpose, and scanning\ntechnologies have shown\nthese vessels can faithfully mimic the process of\nblood vessels sprouting\ninside the body. On top\nof that, they demonstrated\na key pathway that is\nknown to regulate angio-genesis, suggesting these\nengineered vessels are of\ngreat biological relevance\nto studying cancer.\nTo investigate whether\nthis model can be used\nfor drug testing they\ntreated the vessels with\nanti-cancer drugs that\ninhibit angiogenesis,\nSorafenib and Sunitinib,\nas a proof-of-concept.\nTheir result confirmed the\neffectiveness of such a\nmodel and implicated the\npotential use of microves-sel-on-chip for drugs\nscreening in the future.\nNevertheless, there\nare drawbacks to this\ntechnology. Firstly, due to\nits simplicity the direction\nof angiogenesis cannot be\nstudied. As mentioned,\ncancer cells often release\nmolecules to direct new\nblood vessels to grow\ntowards them. This\nmodel can only mimic the\ndevelopment of vessels,\nbut not the directional\nmigration of angiogenesis\nsprouting. Therefore, it is\nlikely that this technology\nwill be used in pre-clini-cal models but may not\nfully eliminate the use of\nanimals in research.\nNonetheless, this\nmodel is an improvement\nfrom traditional 2D-cell\nculture, and other diseases\n\u2013 such as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetic retin-opathy \u2013 can potentially\nbe studied. Hopefully,\nin conjunction with high\nthroughput technologies,\nmore effective drugs can\nbe developed to cure\ncancer and these related\ndiseases in the coming\ndecade.\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nMicrovessel-on-chips are helping fight cancer // CC\n\n"

Last\ntime these teams met\nSussex won comfortably,\nso Imperial were keen\nfor this not to be a repeat.\nImmediately, Imperial\nimposed themselves on\nthe game and held most\nof the possession in the\nfirst ten minutes. Sussex\nwere constantly under\npressure. Windy conditions meant kicking for\ntouch was difficult for us,\nand Sussex were able to\ncounterattack effectively.\nThey would have scored\na couple of times, had\nJosh Pope not been there\nto make some try saving\ntackles. Not all heroes\nwear capes. Eventually,\nvia some lucky offloads,\nSussex were able to run in\na try down the wing.\nColonel\u2019 Ustaran-Anderegg and try-saver Josh\nPope to make some yards.\nMounting pressure and\nstrong carries from the\nlikes of Jerome Hallett\nand Ali Zaboronsky led to\nSussex giving away penalties on their try line. We\nopted for the corner, and\na lineout maul was easily\ndriven over Sussex\u2019s line\nwith Toby Simpson at the\nback of it. Toby later made\nit clear to me in the union\nbar that he likes it when I\nmention his tries in match\nreports. After forcing his\nway over the try line, Toby\neloquently placed the ball\ndown in Sussex\u2019s try area\nwith the precision of a\nsurgeon and the elegance\nof a ballerina, to earn five\npoints for his team. Still in\nawe of Toby\u2019s try, a lapse\nin concentration from\nImperial meant Sussex\nwere able to score another\ntry on the stroke of half\ntime, making the score\n9-5 to them.\nImperial were very\nbusy in defence for the\nmajority of the second half\nand did everything they\ncould to find a way back\ninto the game. Sussex\nkept possession and did\nnot let us find a rhythm.\nMartin Head, at this point\nstill undefeated in an arm\nwrestle (RIP), consistently knocked Sussex\nback in defence and\ndragged players down by\ntheir ankles. Toby Daniels\nalso put in some big hits\nand Oli Parker made some\nimportant tackles on his\nwing. Unfortunately,\ndespite fighting until the\nvery end, Imperial were\nunable to hold off Sussex\nin attack and conceded\nthree tries in the second\nhalf. The final score was\n36-5. Whilst disappoint-ing, the score line did\nnot reflect the true nature\nof the match, which was\ntightly contested for all\n80 minutes, and Imperial\nleft with their heads held\nhigh.

With\nthe classic bitter cold\nwind swirling in the\nFortress, the anticipation\nof that night\u2019s ACC on\neveryone\u2019s minds and\ncoach LJ with his standard\n\u201cwin this and go out and\nget smashed later\u201d team\ntalk, the scene was set.\nThe match started perfectly for IC with some strong\ncarries across the gain\nline sucking in the RUMS\ndefence and leaving space\nout wide for Ifan Dafydd\nto go over in the corner\nfor the first try of the\nmatch. Not long after,\nHarold Pinter crossed the\nwhitewash after hitting\na beautiful line through\nthe midfield and with the\npace of a back, second\nrow Gianluigi Tosti also\nbagged a meat pie. By\nhalf time, Imperial were\nleading 19-0 and just one\nmore try would secure\nthem the bonus point.\nEarly on in the second\nhalf, after some pressure\nin the RUMS 22, it looked\nlike Imperial were about\nto get this bonus point\nwhen Jack Fraser threw a\nbeautifully weighted flat\npass straight into the arms\nof a RUMS player who\nthe IC men though and\nthe bonus point try was\nsecured shortly after-wards. Tries came in thick\nand fast in the second half\nand at times it felt as if the\nRUMS defence was like\nIfan\u2019s hair \u2013 non-existent.\nHarold Pinter teased the\nRUMS defence further as\nhe ran through the middle\nof three players, ball in\none hand, and placed the\nball right underneath the\nsticks. The second half\nalso saw some big replacements come on and\nmake an instant impact.\nAndreas Jesperson, who\nrecently claimed he could\nplay any position, showed\nthat he could at least play\non the wing by scoring\na 50m try with his first\ntouch of the ball. Later on\nthat evening, he would tell\nthis tale to a female in the\nUnion bar and she would\nfall in love with him. A\nsmall drop in concentration in the final minute\nof the game meant that\nRUMS got their second\nand final try in the match\nbut that did not hamper the\nspirits of the IC boys too\nmuch who could already\ntaste the victorious post-match port and pints.\nGianluigi Tosti completed\na hat-trick of hat-trick\navoidances whilst Wilbur\nSandoe and Andreas\nJesperson got a meat pie\neach too. (Paddy) Jackson\nFraser certainly brought\nhis kicking boots with him\ntoo, successfully landing\n6 of the 8 conversions in\nless than ideal kicking\nconditions. Coach LJ\nawarded two man of the\nmatch performances that\nday, one to Rob Lawrence\nwho proved that turning\nup to trainings is actually\npointless and the other to\nIfan Dafydd who proved\nthat you\u2019re never too old\nto play.

The Overwatch\ncompetitive pool has\ngrown rapidly over the\nyear, with four Imperial\nteams (of 7-8 players\neach) looking to participate in the coming season\nof the National University\neSports League (NUEL).\nPart of this increase in\nnumber is due to the\nstandard of playing\ndemonstrated at Varsity\nby the 1st team, who\nare currently comprised\nonly of players ranked\nMaster or Grandmaster\n(top 3% and 1% of the\ngame). They train quite\noften and rigorously,\nand discuss strategies\nin detail. Clearly, their\nefforts did not go to waste\nas they showed UCL who\nwas boss. The MVP was\nRaymond \u201cLood\u201d Li, the\ncaptain of the team.\nIn the Starcraft 2\nImperial came into\nthe League of Legends\nmatches with a sense\nof having something to\nprove, after their team was\nplaced lower than UCL\u2019s\na few months ago in the\nNUEL. They seemed\nto take UCL\u2019s team by\nsurprise when they won\nthe first two games within\nan hour \u2013 a rather speedy\nturn of events considering\nmatches usually last 40\nminute apiece. Imperial\nshowed a great deal of\ncoordination and overall\nskill, going for a vi-sion-oriented strategy that\nsaw them placing more\nthan double the number\nof wards placed by UCL.\nThe MVP went to Chris\n\u201cCarniflexin\u201d Swain for\nhis stellar performance\nacross Ryze and Azir.\nChris and his team will\nalso be participating in a\nLoL tournament against\nCambridge this coming\nweek.

Only one\nmatch was played this\ntime, but that was long\nenough for Imperial to\nstake their claim, playing\na solid terrorist side in the\nfirst half, and facing down\na UCL side reluctant to\nbe defeated in the second.\nOverall the match went to\nICL, with the final score\nstanding at 16-8.\nThere was less of a\nsense of needing to prove\nsomething in the Rocket\nLeague matches, but nev-after the first match went\nconvincingly to UCL.\nTwo close games ran into\novertime, but the players\nwere all very friendly,\nhelped out by a great\nshoutcaster highlighting\nevery \u201cCalculated\u201d shot\nand whipping the crowd\ninto a frenzy.\nThe matches across the\nrest of the day highlighted\nsome of the skills of\nthe highest-performing\nplayers at Imperial and\nUCL. Both teams had\na top-1000 player in\nEurope for their Hearthstone matches, which\nwere carried by UCL\nafter an unlucky turn of\nevents. The casters again\nmanaged to get everyone\npumped, and there was a\ngreat energy among the\nspectators. This energy\ncould also be found in the\nSuper Smash Bros Melee\nmatches, in which UCL\nentered with an advantage,\nhaving had more frequent\npractice in tournaments.\nAfter not taking the first\nmatch too seriously,\nhowever, UCL realised\nwhat a threat Imperial\ncould be, and carried the\nnext two matches. The\nfinal match delivered a\nraucous turn of events,\nas Imperial very nearly\nmade a comeback, taking\nnone continuous stocks \u2013\nnot quite enough to win\nthe match, but more than\nenough to leave us on the\nedge of our seats.\nThere was only time to\nplay one match of DoTA,\nbut both teams made sure\nit was worth watching.\nUCL entered the match\nwith two top 1000 in\nEurope players, while\nImperial had one former\ntop-1000 on their side.\nPicking hero, Imperial\nmanaged to hold their\nown at the beginning of\nthe game, but a couple of\nbad choices meant things\nsnowballed, and the\nvictory went to UCL.\nWhile naturally\nhighlighting the skills of\nplayers across both sides,\nthe eSports varsity also\nwent a long way in showcasing the importance of\ngetting in great casters,\nand how the audience\nmembers really made the\nday one to remember \u2013 no\nwonder tickets were sold\nout!

From\nthis, Alan\u2019s analysis is\nprecisely right; Imperial\nsimply isn\u2019t offering equal\nopportunities to prospective students from every\nbackground.\nHowever, what I do\nhave to take argument\nwith is Alan\u2019s suggestion\nthat we need to \u2018sacrifice\u2019 Imperial\u2019s current\nlocation in order to tackle\nthis problem. I fail to see\nhow simply moving the\nImperial campus from\none of the most expensive\nboroughs to a slightly\ncheaper borough whilst\nremaining in one of the\nmost fantastically expensive cities in the world\nwill make any substantial\ndifference. Prospective\nstudents will still be\nfaced by the perception of\n\u2018London Prices\u2019 whether\nwe are based in White city\nor Kensington. Further to\nthis, the chances are that\nthe college would struggle\nto attract the same talent\nit does now because, let\u2019s\nbe honest, unless you are\nreally into dual carriage-ways, the A40 is hardly a\npatch on Exhibition Road.\nBut with all this negativity let\u2019s take a moment\nto consider something\nthat Imperial already does\nreally well. The Imperial\nBursary scheme is one\nof the most generous\nschemes of its kind in the\ncountry, with the most\ndisadvantaged students receiving up to \u00a35k on top of\nthe \u00a311k that they already\nreceive from the UK\ngovernment. This is easily\nenough to live a comfortable student existence in\nKensington without even\nconsidering potential\nearnings over the 3-month\nsummer break that most\nstudents get. If finance\nreally is the problem, the\ncollege should promote\ntheir bursary more. It\nwill almost certainly go\nmuch further to tackling\nthe inequality problem at\nImperial than decanting\nthe physics department\ninto Zone 12.\nNot only do I think\nAlan\u2019s solution would\nbe ineffective, I feel it\ncompletely misses the\nreal point here: dropping\npeople\u2019s rent by a few\nquid a week isn\u2019t the\nissue. The issue isn\u2019t that\ndisadvantaged students\nperceive Imperial to be\ntoo expensive, but that\nthey perceive themselves\nto be unlikely to attain\nthe A*A*A average\noffer. For real change\nthe problem needs to be\ntackled twofold, with\npolicy revised by both\nthe government and the\ncollege.\nFirstly, the College\nneeds to wake up and\nrethink its admissions\npolicy in order to ensure\nthat it makes offers to the\nmost talented students.\nAccording to the Institute of Fiscal Studies,\nin the academic year\n2015/16 the mean average\nspending per head on state\nschool A-Level students\nwas of the order of \u00a35k a\nyear. In contrast, in 2015\naverage fees for private\nday schooling in the UK\nstood at a little over \u00a313k,\nwith some of the leading\npublic schools charging\nsubstantially more than\nthis. This vast difference\nin spending results in\nstudents from less well-off\nareas receiving a considerably inferior education\nthan those from the more\nadvantaged backgrounds.\nThis is particularly true\nof applicants to Imperial\nfrom state schools. STEM\nsubject specialists are\nparticularly hard to attract\nand retain at state schools\ndue to the significantly\nhigher salaries which\nthese staff can attain in\nother professions.\nBy the time UCAS\napplications come around,\nthis vast discrepancy in\neducational backgrounds\nas likely to excel as those\nwho scored top marks in\ntheir A-Levels but paid\nfor the pleasure.\nI concede there are\ndifficulties in identifying\nwho these talented, but\neducationally under-nour-ished students are, but it\nappears Oxford and Cambridge have managed to\nsucceed in doing so. The\nratio of students admitted\nfrom the most advantaged\nto most disadvantaged\nbackgrounds at the\nOxbridge universities has\nfallen significantly over\nthe last seven years.\nPersonally, I am of\nthe opinion that the best\nway to identify the best\nstudents is not through\nA-Levels, but through\na rigorous and broad\ninterviewing process.\nAdmissions tutors, in a\nface to face environment,\ncan much better probe\na student, see how they\nunderstand things and\njudge their suitability for\nan Imperial degree pro-gramme. We should not\nbe making offers to prospective students based\non how many Saturday\nclasses they have had and\nhow well they have been\nspoon fed A-Level exam\nanswers.\nAlthough we appear\nto be the worst for it, this\nisn\u2019t a problem that exists\nat Imperial alone. The\nproblem of the UK\u2019s universities being dominated\nby the privileged few is\na nation-wide problem.\nThe government needs\nto act, investing more\nmoney into state schools\nto ensure that all students\nhave access to the inspiring and well qualified\nteachers that they deserve.\nSolving inequality at Imperial is an issue the university will dodge for years // Flickr\n\u201cStudents from\nless well-off\nareas receive\na considerably\ninferior\neducation than\nthose from\nprivileged\nbackgrounds\u201d\nleads to an equally vast\ndifference in the quality\nof applications between\nthese students. But\ncrucially, this difference\nin the quality of the applications is not the same\nas a difference in quality\nof the applicants! On the\nwhole, students in state\nschools are not any less\nintelligent, hard-working,\nenthusiastic or driven\nthan those who have\nhad a private education.\nGive these state schooled\nstudents access to the\nsame excellent quality\nof education (at Imperial\nCollege) and they are just\n\n"

One of the team members, Georgios\nChatzitheoklitos, shares their experience of getting the funding and preparing for the adventure.\nGeorgiosChatzitheoklitos\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\nHow it all started\u2026\nB\neing an overly\nexcited prospective student,\nI was reading\nall the emails sent by the\ncollege. There I stumbled\nupon the Imperial College\nExploration Board and\nlearned about all the\nstudent expeditions to\nvarious exotic places that\nthe Board had previously\nsupported. Any Imperial\nstudent can present a proposal for an adventurous\nexpedition abroad and if\napproved, the Board will\nprovide financial assis-tance. The Board consists\nof senior academics from\nall departments who meet\ntwice a year, in December\nand February, to consider\nstudent proposals. The\nproposals have to include\nthe budget, itinerary,\ntraining schedule, and\nrisk assessment, and are\nthen judged based on their\nviability and preparation.\nDream team search\nIn winter 2017, the\ntime was running out\nas the deadline for the\nproposal submissions\nwas approaching, and\nmany ideas were floating\naround. But since\nGeorgios had recently\nbeen to a Corsican restaurant and Max was reading\nabout the toughest trail\nin Europe, the decision\non the destination came\nabout naturally: the\nGR20, a 180km 15-day\ntransverse in Corsica, a\nFrench island. It was the\nperfect choice: safe, cheap\nto travel to, and most importantly would grant us\nhuge bragging rights!\nNow we just had to find\npeople that were willing\nand able to spend three\nweeks of their summer\nin the rugged mountains,\nthen plan everything,\nand write a report! Even\nthough we were introverted freshers and didn\u2019t\nknow our coursemates\nvery well, it wasn\u2019t hard to\nassemble the team. Carla\nwas sitting next to the\nboys in lectures and was\nfascinated by the beautiful\npictures of the mountains\nthey were google-search-ing. Georgios had heard\nrumours that Diane was a\nkeen climber, while Carla\nsuspected that Harry\nwould be into it because\nhe wore really cool hiking\ngear to lectures every\nday. Max invited Jake\nand Albert as well who,\nafter helping us with the\nproposal, were informed\nby their doctors that they\nweren\u2019t allowed to put\nthat much stress on their\nknees.\nBut finally, the\ncombined efforts of seven\nstudents who were very\nclose to the deadline\nproduced, as always,\nspectacular results. We\nwere pleasantly surprised\nto learn that the Board\nwanted us to present our\nproposal to them. The\nsurprise turned into stress\nas we learned who the\nBoard was composed of:\nlots of senior academ-ics, with two of them\nfrom our department,\nand students who led\nsuccessful expeditions\nin the past. After being\ngrilled for 20 minutes\n(which felt like ages), all\nwe had to do was wait.\nOur reaction after seeing the mountains we were to climb // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos\nThe team met in Toulon, Southern France // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos\nKicking off the year with the toughest trail in Europe\nWe were slightly disappointed as we didn\u2019t think\nwe\u2019d convinced them\u2026\nHowever, in spring 2017,\nthe long-awaited email\nfinally arrived, and it was\npositive! They were going\nto cover almost half of our\nexpenses, including insurance and first aid training.\nWithout such a massive\namount of support, it\nwould\u2019ve been impossible\nto do the GR20.\nPreparation\nEven though we were\nalmost half a year away\nfrom the trip start date,\nthere was a lot to prepare\n\u2013 equipment, plane/ferry/\ntrain/bus tickets (since all\nof us were going to leave\nfrom a different place),\nandaccommodationonthe\nisland. Also, in summer\n2017, to ensure our new\nkit was up to scratch\nand the group\u2019s fitness\nwas good enough, Max\norganised a weekend trip\nto the Brecon Beacons, a\nmountain range in Wales,\nwhere he had planned a\n50km route over two days.\nUnfortunately, on the first\nday, Max\u2019s leather boots\ncaused him problems\nto such extent that we\ndecided not to continue\nthe hike. Instead, we tested\nout the tents, sleeping\nbags, and sleeping mats in\nCarla\u2019s back garden: we\nwere then confident that\nour kit was fit for the trail,\nsince it survived a night\nin the rainy wilderness of\nSwindon. The attempted\ntraining weekend in Wales\nwas still a useful experience because Max bought\na new pair of fabric boots\nwhich didn\u2019t cause him a\nsingle blister during the\nentire length of the GR20.\nOff to Corsica!\nIn September 2017,\nstarting from all around\nEurope, we began our long\njourney to Corsica. After\n36 hours of travelling and\nfour means of transport,\nwe finally arrived. We\nwere all annoyed after\nsleeping on the ferry but\nlittle did we know that it\nwould be the most comfortable sleep for the next\n15 days! We visited the\nlast affordable supermarket we could find (where\nwe forgot to buy cooking\ngas\u2026) and went to our\nAirBnB to prepare for the\nbig day. The first thing to\narouse our curiosity was\nthat Diane\u2019s rucksack felt\nlike a sack of bricks. This\nwas closely seconded\nby the mystery of how\nGeorgios\u2019s bag with six\n(yes, 6!) t-shirts, seven\npairs of underwear, and\na glass bottle of Cognac\ndid not feel like a sack\nof bricks! And although\nthere was excitement and\nanticipation in the air, we\nwere also anxious as we\ndidn\u2019t know how the hell\nwe\u2019d manage to walk the\ntoughest trail in Europe!\nFurther adventures\nIn the next article:\nthe team steers off the\ntrail to climb the highest\npeak of the island and\ngets followed by 80\nBelgian paratroopers,\nand the reason behind\nDiane\u2019s heavy rucksack is\nrevealed! So stay tuned.\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFRIDAY, 9TH\nFEBRUARY, 2018 FELIX\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nPhantom Thread: A haunting masterpiece\nSir Daniel Day-Lewis bows out on a high as Paul Thomas Anderson returns with the best film of the year.\nT\nhough he excelled as a young\nactor in the\nNational Youth\nTheatre, in 1975 Daniel\nDay-Lewis made a decision that almost deprived\nus of some of the very\ngreatest performances\never seen on screen. Then\nan unruly 18 year old,\nDay-Lewis elected not to\npursue the arts, instead\napplying for a five year\napprenticeship as a cabi-net-maker. Fortunately for\ncinephiles everywhere, he\nwas rejected due to lack\nof experience. Instead he\nwas accepted at the Bristol\nOld Vic Theatre School,\nand the rest is history.\nDay-Lewis\u2019 passion for\nthe crafts is well known \u2013\na dedicated woodworker,\nhe also once worked as a\nroad-cobbler in Tuscany\nfor 18 months during\none of his notoriously\nlong lay-offs between\nacting jobs. He uses this\nlove to aid his portrayal\nin Phantom Thread of a\nfastidious haute couture\ndressmaker in the high\nsociety glamour of 1950s\nLondon as he heads into\nhis longest lay-off of all:\nretirement.\nThe couturier at the\ncentre of this tale is\nthe wonderfully named\nReynolds Woodcock.\nHe operates a fashion\nsalon from his towering\nGeorgian townhouse\nin Fitzroy Square that\nvery closely resembles\nthe Saville Row house\nof Sir Hardy Amies, the\nman behind the crisp,\nunderstated looks of the\n\u201cAnderson\u2019s\nscreenplay\nis endlessly\nsurprising,\nweaving in\ndirections one\nnever predicts\u201d\nQueen\u2019s early reign. As\never with Anderson, his\nlead is an amalgamation\nof a number of fascinating true life figures. In\nThe Master, Lancaster\nDodd was a mashup of\nL. Ron Hubbard and\nJohn Steinbeck; here,\nWoodcock is drawn from\nthe likes of Crist\u00f3bal\nBalenciaga, Christian\nDior, and Charles James.\nAs Reynolds goes about\nhis day with extreme\nroutine and superstition \u2013\nincluding silent breakfasts\n\u2013 his sister Cyril, played\nby the wonderful Lesley\nManville with icy aplomb,\ntends to both his pernick-ety needs and the logistical\nside of the business. Early\non, Reynolds takes a trip\nto the country for some\nrest from his exhaustingly\nprocedural life, where he\nmeets young immigrant\nwaitress Alma, giving\nher the sexiest breakfast\norder ever on screen. He\nis instantly taken by her,\nearly on telling her \u201cI\nfeel I\u2019ve been looking for\nyou for a very long time\u201d,\nand whisks her back to\nhis London lair after a\npeculiar first date.\nTo delve into the plot\nany further would be a\nmiscarriage of justice.\nAnderson\u2019s screenplay\nis endlessly surprising,\nweaving in directions\none could never predict\nas Reynolds and Alma\nbattle for control over\ntheir lives, with Cyril \u2013\nReynold\u2019s old so-and-so\nas he affectionately refers\nto her \u2013 watching over\nwith an eagle eye. The\nfilm ensues like a dark\nfairy tale, most closely\nresembling Rebecca, but\ncomparable in different\nways to Sunset Boulevard,\nAll About Eve, and The\nRed Shoes. It is haunted,\npaying tribute to the likes\nof Kubrick, Hitchcock,\nand the Brothers Grimm\nat different times, and\nyet it is incredibly funny.\nIn particular Manville\ndelivers her put downs\nwith a razor sharp tongue,\nin some of the most\nmemorable lines of an\nastonishingly quotable\nfilm, especially considering Anderson\u2019s intense\nappreciation of moments\nof quiet and silence.\nThe whole picture sees\ntechnical masters at the\ntop of their game. Aside\nfrom Anderson\u2019s writing\nand directing, and the remarkable performances of\nDay-Lewis, Manville, and\nrelative newcomer Krieps\n(who commendably holds\nher own against one of the\nfinest actors ever to grace\nthe screen), Anderson also\nserves as his own cine-matographer, conjuring\npristine shots from the\nshadowy corners of the\ntown house, adding to the\ngothic feel of the picture.\nJonny Greenwood\u2019s score\nis a thing of beauty, mixing\nmuted, creepy piano\nwith soaring, romantic\nstrings; meanwhile\nDylan Tichenor\u2019s editing\nis clean and rhythmic.\nThe costume design and\nproduction design, from\nMark Bridges and Mark\nTildesley respectively, are\nsimply sublime.\nAnderson, like\nDay-Lewis, was a tremendous young talent, having\nachieved more in his\ntwenties than many great\ndirectors do in their entire\ncareers. He is a filmmaker\nsynonymous with great\nAmerican stories, particularly those set in his home\nstate of California: a megalomaniac oil baron going\nhead to head with a young,\ncharismatic preacher\nat the turn of the 20th\ncentury; the beginnings of\na scientology-like cult in\na United States suffering\nfrom an identity crisis\npost-war; a young man\ndesperately crying out for\na family and finding one\nin the Los Angeles porn\nscene in the late seventies.\nDeparting his home state\nfor the first time ever, he is\nat the peak of his powers,\neschewing the vast landscapes of the Valley for\nhis most intimate film\nyet. Both Anderson and\nDay-Lewis are obsessively driven, reclusive men,\nonly focused on the work,\nand never seeking fame\nor celebrity, making their\ncombination the only one\nthat could have worked so\nwell in bringing the world\nof Reynolds Woodcock to\nlife. Where they differ is\non their desire to continue\nworking. Day-Lewis\nis quite possibly burnt\nout from the undeniably\ndemanding way in which\nhe becomes the great men\nhe portrays. On the other\nhand, Anderson, who has\nnever held another job\nthan being a filmmaker,\ninsists that he will go on\nmaking films as long as he\nis allowed to. Long may\nhe continue.\nEverywhere you look, there\u2019s a hem // Universal Pictures\nFILM\nAshley Luckyram\nFilm Editor\nDir: Paul Thomas Anderson.\nScript: Paul Thomas\nAnderson.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFRIDAY, 9TH\nFEBRUARY, 2018 FELIX\n8\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nPoor use of statistics is undermining our faith\nin public institutions\nPoliticians have been misuing statistics for too long, and it\u2019s paved the way for the rise of fake\nnews.\nPOLITICS\nDivyen\nVanniasegaram\nPolitics Editor\nT\nhe rise of statistics has led to\nmany benefits\nin everyday\nlife: we use statistics\nin medical research to\ndetermine what the best\ntreatment; they inform\ndecisions from stock\nmarkets through to how\nmany pop tarts Walmart\nstocks; and, perhaps most\nsignificantly, statistics\nshape decisions made by\nmodern governments such\nas which levels of taxation are required to meet\nspending demands and\nstimulate the economy.\nThe kind of Brexit the\nUK government should\nseek has been thrust into\nthe spotlight with the\nleaking of the statistical\nmodels produced by\nthe civil service. These\nsuggest that all forms of\nBrexit would harm the\nUK economy and the\nUK must have as close a\nrelationship with the EU\nto save it from the worst\nof these consequences.\nSeveral individuals and\ngroups have lined up to\ncriticise the work as misleading and politically\nmotivated, including\none of the government\u2019s\nown Brexit ministers.\nRecently there\u2019s been\na growing backlash\nagainst statistics, at first\nfrom the public, and now,\nmore worryingly, from\npoliticians. However,\nthis is the fault of politicians themselves.\nPoliticians of\nall stripes hide behind\nmisleading statistic\nafter misleading statistic\nto justify their policy\npositions. This can be\nmost evidently seen at\nPrime Minister\u2019s Questions (PMQs) every\nweek. During PMQs on\nthe 25th\nof January this\nyear the Prime Minister\ntrotted out the following statistic in relation\nto A&E services: \u201cIn\nEngland 497 people\nwere waiting more than\n12 hours, but the latest\nfigures also show that,\nunder the Labour Government in Wales, 3,741\npeople were waiting\nmore than 12 hours.\u201d\nWhat the Prime Minister\nfailed to mention was\nthat these figures aren\u2019t\neven comparable. In\nEngland, the clock starts\nonly once a patient has\nhad an initial assessment\nby a doctor, while in\nWales the clock starts\nthe moment someone\nwalks through the door\nin A&E. The intentional\nmisuse of statistics such\nas this causes several\nproblems.\nAt PMQs, neither the\nPrime Minister nor the\nLeader of the Opposition spend any time\nanswering questions. All\nthat appears to happen\nis Corbyn throws a\nquestion wrapped up\nwith some statistic at\nTeresa May, which she\nwill entirely fail to\nanswer, instead retorting with contradictory\nand apparently equally\ntruthful information.\nThis does nothing to get\nto the nub of the issue\nor inform the public,\nleading to poor governance and poor policy;\nflaws and criticisms are\nnot given the careful\nconsideration needed to\nensure the best outcome\nas politicians swat away\nany issue with the use of\na few facts and figures.\nThis undermines the role\nof Parliament and the\ncrucial work it must do\nin holding the government and the executive\nhas been a push back\nagainst \u201cexperts\u201d which\nhas been seen in the\nvote for Brexit, Trump,\nand even in medicine,\nwhere experts have been\nportrayed as out of touch\nand callous. Cases such\nas Charlie Gard and\nAlfie Evans, which has\nitself spawned \u201cthe Alfie\nArmy\u201d to help fight off\nthe nasty clinicians who\nare apparently out to kill\nAlfie, are indicative of\nthis trend. The rise of\nalternative therapies,\nsuch as homeopathy\nand Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s\nGoop, fits with the\npattern. When the\nveracity of fact has been\nabused so abundantly it\nbecomes increasingly\neasier for fringe groups\nto release information\nthat is intentionally\nmisleading or \u201cfake\nnews\u201d, as the ability to\ndecipher the truth from\nfiction has already been\nundermined by the mainstream media and politi-than what might garner\nthem more support at\nthe polls according to\ntheir spin doctors and\nfocus groups. Ideally\npoliticians should utilise\nall the information at\nhand to make the decisions they see fit. The\nhonest use of statistics\nwould lead to better\noutcomes for govern-ment, allowing it to\nreact and develop policy\nto clearly tackle the\nreal challenges the UK\nfaces. The government\nand politicians could\nlead from the front,\ndemonstrating the good\nwork facts and figures\ncan and should do. They\ncould roll back the tide\nof \u201cfake news\u201d and the\nwar against experts. Unfortunately, politicians\nappear unable to do this.\nIf they left statistics\nalone the purity of fact\nwould be restored for\nthe rest of us to enjoy\nand prosper from.\nWhy have we had enough of experts, Mr Gove? // Wikimedia\ncians. This sorry state of\naffairs is epitomized by\ntools such Channel 4\u2019s\nFactCheck, which nobly\nattempts to explain the\ntruth behind some of the\nstatistics politicians and\nothers use. Its utility and\nexistence highlight the\nfact that statistics are\nnow unfortunately often\nhalf-truths, mis-truths or\nentirely untrue.\nPerhaps statistics\nshould be taken out\nof politics altogether.\nThey very rarely appear\nto inform the debate,\nbut are rather utilized\nas a smokescreen to\ndeceive the public.\nStatistics should be used\nto inform government\npolicy rather than be\nmanipulated and misrepresented to justify\npoor policy after the\nfact. Politics devoid of\nstatistics would see politicians make decisions\nbased off of what they\nbelieved to be right by\nmoral principle rather\n\u201cMisuse of\nstatistics\nerodes the\npublic\u2019s faith,\nnot just in\npolitics, but in\nother areas of\nlife too\u201d\nto account.\nThis behaviour erodes\naway the public\u2019s faith\nin statistics, which has\nramifications, not just\nin politics but other\nparts of life too.

Looking back\non 2017, the good news\nis that ten more countries legalised same-sex\nmarriage. However, the\nLGBT+ community also\nsuffered severe attacks\nin countless parts of the\nworld, with an extreme\nexample being the abduction and torture of over\n100 men, at least three\nof whom were killed, in\nthe Chechen Republic\nof Russia on the basis of\ntheir perceived sexual\norientation. This was not\nan isolated incident, as\ndiscrimination against\nLGBT+ people is insti-tutionalised in Russia\n\u2013 activists\u2019 requests to\nhold rallies are frequently\nrejected by officials and\nwhen these events occur\nit is not uncommon for\nparticipants to be targeted\nby homophobic attacks.\nIn October, Human\nRights Watch reported the\narrest and torture of gay\nandbisexualmenbypolice\nin Azerbaijan. Similar\ninstitutional crackdowns\noccurred in Indonesia\nand Egypt only last year.\nFurthermore, the widespread misunderstanding\nof transgender people, and\nthe lack of recognition of\nthe separation of gender\nidentity and sexual orien-tation, imply that the trans\ncommunity is also very\nlikely to be persecuted or\notherwise abused under\nsuch anti-gay laws.\nNonetheless, it must be\nthe LGBT+ community,\nbut to attain fundamental\nhuman rights.\nSince the decriminali-sation of homosexuality\nin 1967, the UK has implemented further laws to\nadvance LGBT+ rights,\nincluding protection\nagainst discrimination in\nemployment, allowing\ntransgender people to\nchange their name and\nlegal gender, and the\nlegalisation of same-sex\nmarriage. However, improvements still need to\nbe made. For example, the\nUK\u2019s Gender Recognition\nAct still involves a highly\nmedicalised process and\ndoes not recognise non-bi-nary people. Moreover,\ntrans youth are extremely\nunder-represented in\nsociety and are frequently\nattacked in the media to\nthe point that almost half\nof trans pupils in the UK\nhave attempted suicide.\nIn fact, schools are still\nnot safe spaces for trans\nand LGB people, and\ncurrent sex education is\nnot inclusive of LGBT+\nissues. According to\nrecent data from Stonewall, many LGBT+\npeople face significant\nchallenges in all areas,\nwith 45% of LGBT+\nstudents facing bullying\nfor their sexual orientation or gender identity\nand 25% of transgender\npeople feeling obliged to\nswitch jobs as a result of\nharassment and bullying.\nThere is no place in the\nworld where full equality\nhas been reached. It is\nan ongoing battle where\nrollbacks often happen.\nThis is why it is so\nimportant to acknowledge\nthe contributions LGBT+\npeople have made to\nsociety in the face of\nsystemic oppression and\nto honour those who have\ncommitted their lives to\nsecuring a better future for\nthe LGBT+ community.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m up\nto at the moment!\nA\ns part of LGBT History Month,\nIQ (Imperial College LGBT+) and\nI are running a series of events\nthroughout February.\nThis weekend you can join IQ at the\nNational Student Pride, one of the biggest\nstudent events of the year, featuring\nCourtney Act.\nIf you would like to learn more about LGBT\nhistory, Lola Phoenix is coming to Imperial\non the 13th\nfor their talk on the Stonewall\nRiots, Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and\nmore. IQ will provide snacks, and there will\nbe an opportunity for a Q&A at the end!\nAlso, don\u2019t miss out on the very first LGBT+\ncareers fair at Imperial on the 22nd\n.\nHave a look at imperialcollegeunion.\norg/lgbthm for upcoming events later this\nmonth.\nIn the last few months, through\nconsultations with students and staff from\ndifferent departments, I have identified\nseveral things College should be pushed to\nimplement to improve the LGBT+ student\nexperience. Besides more gender-neutral\nfacilities \u2013 which is an issue I have been\nworking on this year and that is currently\nbeing considered by College \u2013 these include\nspecialised wellbeing and careers support\nfor LGBT+ students and the use of inclusive\nlanguage in lectures, resources, and\ncommunications. A major long-term goal\nis trans-inclusive training for senior tutors\nand key members of staff. Considerable\nsteps in the right direction were made this\nyear with the drafting of a College policy\naimed at supporting trans students. Transinclusive training is something I am raising\nwith College senior members of staff at\nthe moment, but that will probably require\nfurther lobbying efforts in the next years.\nLIBERATION\nAlessio Incitti\nLGBT+ Officer\n(he/him/his)\nQueen\u2019s Tower all lit up // Imperial\n\u201cThere is no\nplace in the\nworld where\nfull equality\nhas been\nreached\u201d\nrecognised that LGBT+\npeople worldwide face\nextreme daily oppression\nthat goes unreported. This\nis reflected by the fact that\nengaging in same-sex relations remains criminal-ised in 72 countries, and\nis punishable by death in\nat least four of these. Most\ncountries do not allow\ntrans people to change\ntheir name and gender\nfrom those assigned at\nbirth and only a few recognise non-binary people.\nIt is estimated that a\nquarter of the world\u2019s\npopulation believes that\nbeing LGBT should be a\ncrime.\nIn light of this, it is\nevident that there is still\nan enormous amount of\nwork left to do, not only\nto achieve equality for\n\n"

There was\nexcitement from the first\nwhistle, with captain\nAlex tapping the ball in\nfrom Ife\u2019s cutback in the\nfirst opening seconds.\nThis quick goal was only\nbettered by the eleven\nseconds it took Christian\nEriksen to score against\nUnited the same evening.\nBefore London Met\ncould get into the game,\nfutsal stalwarts Barry\nAllen (fastest man alive)\nand Ife had both added a\ngoal each to their tallies\nin the race to become our\ntop scorer. Daniele de\nRossi-wannabe Tommaso\nand vice-captain Josh\nMendes both fired in\nfrom distance, and Alan\nfinished off after a neat\n1-2 with Alex, who got his\nsecond goal by lashing in\na rebound. Pleasingly, in\nthis match we addressed\nour ongoing problem of\nnot taking our first-half\nchances, leading 7-2 at the\nbreak (iz great success).\nWe were not playing the\nexpansive, rapid passing\ngame (for comparison see\nBarcelona 2010-11) that\nhad been so effective in\nprevious matches, because\nwe simply did not need\nto. Klopp would have\nloved our gegenpressing,\nOur magnificent keeper\nAlejandro (please don\u2019t\nleave us x), a futsal nat-ural, was being worked\nhard as they pulled it back\nto 8-6, at which point\nwe woke up again. Josh\ncompleted his hat-trick,\nand Will justified all the\ntime spent trying flicks\nin training by finally\nscoring one in a match.\nEd and Keidi got stuck\ninto tackles and kept them\nat bay for the rest of the\ncontest. For Ed\u2019s excellent defence he was award\nman of the match along\nwith Josh whose hat-trick\nsecured the game. The\ndeserved victory puts\nus on five wins from six\nleague matches, and we\nnow await our final match\nagainst Queen Mary\u2019s.\nBy the time that comes\naround, it is likely to be a\nhead-to-head title decider.\nSPORTS\nPatrick Brandl\nICS 1st\nTeam\nSPORTS\nAlex Godfrey\nFutsal Captain\nDiverse Men\u2019s 1st team (from left to right): Puvendren Subramaniam (MAS), James McCouat (ENG), Marco Alves (POR), Seigo Masuda (JPN), Patrick Brandl (GER) // ICSC\nDavid Newman\nICS 1st\nTeam\n\u201cJapan\u2019s Seigo\nMasuda (World\nRanking 315)\nwas able to\njoin IC\u201d\nthe order.

Let me assure\nyou, this game is literally\nnot what you expect; if\nyou choose to experience\nit, you\u2019ll be in for a wild,\nfreaky and mind-bending\nride.\nFirst, let\u2019s get two\nmajor points down.\nFirst of all, this game is\nshort, it\u2019ll only take you\naround four-five hours to\ncomplete; maybe three\nif you\u2019re a fast reader.\nSecond of all, this game\nis absolutely free. Yes,\nyou read that right. The\nproducer was well aware\nmost people like yourself\nwould probably dismiss a\ngame that appears cute and\ninnocent on the surface.\nHence why he made this\nfree to download from\nboth steam and the game\u2019s\nwebsite. Hopefully these\nreasons are enough for\nyou to at least begrudgingly install the game and\nsee for yourself what it\u2019s\nabout.\nOnce you load up the\ngame, you\u2019re greeted to a\ncontent warning, advising\nyou not to play if you\u2019re\nbelow thirteen or are\nemotionally sensitive.\nGiven the home screen\nand the charming music,\nthis seems unusual and\ncurious. You dismiss it for\nthe time and start playing.\nFor the first two hours or\nso, the game plays like a\nfairly light-hearted and\njoyful visual novel. You\njoin a high school literature club and yes, you\nhave the option of \u2018dating\u2019\nsome of the characters.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, this\npart of the game is sweet\nF-\u2019 moment, made brilliant by the fact that it just\nshows up when you\u2019re not\nreally expecting it.\nAfter this point, the\ngame shows its true\ncolours and begins to take\na more dark and trippy\ndirection. The game does\na great job showcasing its\ntrue nature with features\nlike visual glitches,\ncharacters acting stranger\nand the music becoming\ndistorted, all of which\nput you on the edge. At\none point, you even lose\ncontrol of the mouse\nand the game forces you\ntowards a certain option.\nThings begin to go more\nand more out of control,\nliterally and figuratively,\nwith almost psychotropic\nplot developments which\nboth haunt and intrigue\nyou.\nAnother noteworthy\nthing is the clever way the\ngame breaks the fourth\nwall at times. At various\npoints, files show up in\nyour game\u2019s file directory\nwhich reference events\nthat have happened or\nforeshadow developments\nto come. At a certain\npoint, you actually have\nto delete a file in order to\nprogress in the game. The\nstory also develops in a\nway that you\u2019ll need to\nreinstall it to play again.\nThis is a psychologically thrilling game that\nno one was expecting, but\nall its players enjoyed. It\nmight be actual game-play-lite but that only\nmakes it more accessible\nto people and doesn\u2019t\ntake away from the experience in the slightest.\nI thoroughly recommend\nplaying this game, especially if you like a unique\nstory; just make sure you\ndon\u2019t do it on a bad day.\nJust Monika // Team Salvato\nGAMES\nSaad Ahmed\nGames Editor\nStudio: Team Salvato.\nDirector: Dan Salvato.\nGenre: Visual-novel\nPlatforms: Microsoft\nWindows, macOS, Linux\nDOKI DOKI LITERATURE\nCLUB\nand charmful, making you\nlet your guard down and\nget involved in the story\nand atmosphere.\nThen, almost out of\nthe blue, an event takes\nplace which I guarantee\nwill shock you.

    "content": "ISSUE 1684\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nA brief, mostly wrong history of the lo-fi aesthetic\nI\nn a world far before\nthe age of high-fidel-ity recording, there\nwas the gramophone.\nRecordings from the era\nare near-inaudible; the\nband plays as loudly as\npossible, so as to make\nthe recording as clear\nas can be. The sound is\nmarked by tinniness and\nan unmistakable crackling\nsound, as the needle sensing the audio encoded on\ncylinders of wax skated\nover random bumps and\ndips that weren\u2019t supposed\nto be there.\nFast forward forty\nyears. Barriers were\nfalling. A \u2018lo-fi\u2019 hit had\nalready charted; Johnny\nAce\u2019s\u2018MySong\u2019,recorded\nin 15 minutes in a radio\nstation, hit #1 on the R&B\ncharts in 1953. And, as\npeople began to gravitate\ntowards new genres that\neschewed studio time, the\nnecessary compromises of\nrecording in less-than-ide-al circumstances caused a\nsea change in aesthetics\npalatable to the common\naudience.\nWell, maybe not to all\nthe ears of the time. The\nBeach Boys released a\ntrio of albums in 1967\nand 1968 (Smiley Smile,\nWild Honey, and Friends),\nrecorded in Brian\nWilson\u2019s makeshift home\nstudio. Now packaged\nin the \u201cBedroom Tapes,\u201d\nthe albums were the first\nproperly lo-fi (as far as\nproduction is concerned)\nin existence.\nIn the ensuing decade,\nlittle headway was made.\nArtists like Paul McCartney and J.W. Farquhar\nrecorded on portable\nequipment, but such\nprojects saw little cultural\nacclaim. The lo-fi aesthetic belonged to the punks\nat this point \u2013 nobody else\nwas too bothered about it.\nBut the lo-fi aesthetic\nlived on. The rise of punk,\ngrunge, and shoegaze in\nthe 80s and 90s brought\na revival to the sound,\nwith renowned bands like\nOperation Ivy, Slowdive,\nand Nirvana all experimenting with low fidelity\nproduction to some extent\nor another. And oddly\nenough, there was some\nfolk around, too.\nThe late 80s saw the\nformation of Neutral\nMilk Hotel, arguably the\nmost recognizable act in\nthe genre. If you haven\u2019t\nalready, treat yourself to\n1999\u2019s In the Aeroplane\nOver the Sea, a disorienting barrage \u2013 nay,\nmasterwork \u2013 of eclectic\ninstrumentation, abstract\nlyricism, and a raw, distorted passion. The album\nhas become a cultural\nicon, a touchstone among\nfellow music nerds when I\nlived in the States. Largely\na continuation of their\nearlier work (their 1996\ndebut On Avery Island:\nfantastic btw). Neutral\nMilk Hotel blended a\nfolk-punk sensibility with\nsomething more profound,\nand that magic glue is the\nlo-fi aesthetic that allows\nsuch abstract lyrics to feel\nclose, personal, confes-sional.\nSpeaking of personal,\nconfessional lyricism,\nthere\u2019s more folk to bring\nup. Through the 80s, John\nDarnielle was recovering\nfrom a rough home life,\ntaking methamphetamine,\nworking as a psychiatric\nnurse, and playing guitar.\nIn 1991, he went off to\ncollege, studied English,\nand started recording his\nguitar playing into his\nboombox. These tapes\nbecame the first Mountain\nGoats releases; since then\na fecund poet, Darnielle\u2019s\ndistorted voice can be\nfound nurturing disgrun-tled, literary-minded\ntwenty-somethings late\ninto the night, lyrics\npeppered with pathos.\nEmo came into its own\nat about this time, and boy\ndid they pick up big on the\nsound. Bands like Sunny\nDay Real Estate and\nModest Mouse took the\nsubtle grit and ran with it.\nNay, emo became lo-fi, to\nthe point where even relatively new acts like Elvis\nDepressedly connect\nto the genre essentially\nthrough their down vibes\nand lo-fi sound, breaking\nnearly entirely in terms\nof instrumentation and\nlicks. And while I\u2019m still\n(obliged to be) talking\nabout emo, I must mention\nBrand New, whose later\nalbums dip into the\naesthetic quite readily. I\nshould also mention Jesse\nLacey allegedly jerked\nit in front of teenagers\nover Skype though, so\ndon\u2019t give them your ad\nrevenue. Or, really, don\u2019t\nlisten to emo, because\nthere\u2019s nothing more\naggravatingly grating to\nme than listening to music\nwith the emotional depth\nof a wet rag. Hate mail\nwill be forwarded to my\nrecycling bin.\nThen, the 2000s\ndawned. Godspeed You!\nBlack Emperor made\nselective use of lo-fi to\nadd texture over their\nrock-kitted orchestra,\nfeaturing field recordings\n(and a chilling bagpipe\nrecording off F#A#). Indie\nwent down a lo-fi rabbit\nhole, as did the rap game\n(El-P and the Def Jux\nguys).\nAnd electronica. Chillwave and glo-fi emerged\nin the late noughts, and\nwhile it was hype for a\ntime, it soon died down.\nOr did it? An offshoot of\nthe above revolves around\nJ-Dilla or Nujabes-style\nbeats, oft referred to\nsimply as \u201clo-fi hip hop,\u201d\ntaking samples of jazz\nsongs and looping them\nover a funk break. Cop a\njhfly album, it\u2019s worth it.\nOh, and vaporwave, I\nguess. But that\u2019s a meme\nanyways, so whatever.\nLo-fi techniques are\nvaried. Many artists will\nblend the hiss of vinyl\nback into their music for a\nwarm and nostalgic mood.\nOthers roll off the highs,\nyielding a mellower,\nmuted sound. Some crank\ngain and seethe white\nnoise. Punk bands go for\na DIY sound to match\nthe ethos of the music;\nGodspeed uses it to build\na setting. Folk bands use\nrough equipment to cultivate an air of honesty and\nsincerity. When contextu-alized, the lo-fi aesthetic\nlends the artist a powerful\ncreative tool \u2013 and its\neffect on the listener.\nSo, um, why? What is\nit exactly that makes lo-fi\nso appealing, from Mac\nDeMarco to FIDLAR? In\nmy pretentious opinion,\nlo-fibreaksthefourthwall.\nMost music is recorded to\nremove any imperfection\nin the process of record-ing, to capture the music\nand nothing else. The specifics of the recording are\ninconsequential. Contrast\nthis to lo-fi, which confronts the listener with the\nnitty-gritty of the album\nbeing assembled in the\nvery fabric of the album;\nthe experience becomes\nmuch more personal\nand raw. This closeness,\noften bolstered by room\nacoustics, gives lo-fi its\nintimacy.\nFuck it, let\u2019s all go back\nto the wax.\nHow can something that sounds so bad in principle sound so very good in practice? Felix investigates.\nMUSIC\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\nShockingly, this is OG lo-fi. // Capitol Believe it or not, this is the OG // 4AD\nI saw this art painted on a pair of sneakers once. // Merge\n\n"

About five minutes\nafter this, students in\nthe Wolfson Suite reported hearing demonic\nvoices coming through\ntheir computer sound\nsystems, while several\nCentral Library cafe staff\nmembers spontaneously\ncombusted. By midday,\na hole had developed in\nthe fabric of space-time,\nthrough which effluxed\nrivers of blood.\nWhile the majority of\nthe library staff fled and/\nor were sucked into the\nportal, a few remained\nworking, despite the rising\ntemperatures, which\nrendered the new climate\ncontrol measures ineffec-tual. \u201cI told them not to\nopen both sets of doors,\u201d\nCaroline Foley, Head\nof Library Maintenance\nServices, told Hangman,\n\u201cit\u2019s written in the new\nemployee handbook that\ndoing so establishes a connection with the demonic\nrealm, but I know some\nstaff never bother reading\nthrough the fine print.\u201d\nKieran Laughlan, Vice\nProvost (Purgatorial Services), spoke to Hangman\nabout the incident:\n\u201cearlier this week, staff\nmembers accidentally\ncreated a portal to a hellish\ndimension. The College\nquickly got the situation\nunder control, and have\nerected a cordon around\nthe area.

Theodor\nVidenberg, a postgraduate\nstudent, cited a number of\nconcerns over the move\nto cashless transactions:\n\u201cCash is a valid and\nlegal tender, and I see no\nreason to prohibit it at the\nCollege. The College has\nnot provided any statistical or scientific evaluation\nof the reason for the long\nqueuing times they cite.\nThey have not shown\nthey are due to the paying\nprocedure itself, rather\nthan more fundamental\nissues [with the catering\nsystems]\u201d\nStudents and staff are\nable to leave feedback\non the trial through an\nonline form.

The launch-date\nof Autumn meant there\nwas \u201cnot sufficient time\nto consult with College\nstaff\u201d, who had expressed\nconcern over a lack of\ntrialling.

So many\nstudents dealing with sensitive issues were unsure\nof their roles, meaning the\nNetwork is hard to handle\nlogistically. Ultimately\nwhile the wellbeing of\nstudents is something we\ncan campaign about, the\nmain issue is a poorly\nequipped counselling\nservice.

The\ncost of the development is\nexpected to total between\n\u00a32 to \u00a33 billion.\nThe masterplan, which\nhas been submitted to the\nA\ncademics at\nU n i v e r s i t y\nC o l l e g e\nLondon this\nweek backed a motion\nof no confidence in the\nuniversity\u2019s leadership,\namid concerns over\nplans for expansion.\nOn Wednesday\nevening, at a meeting of\nUCL staff have no confidence in expansion plans\nacademics, 94% voted\nthey had no confidence in\nUCL\u2019s governance, which\nhas been pushing aggressive expansion over the\npast few years.\nThe meeting came just\ndays after one of the UK\u2019s\nmost senior judges asked\nfor an investigation into\nthe alleged managerial\nmisconduct. Terence\nEtherton, the master\nof the rolls, has asked\nbarrister Charles Bourne\nto look into complaints\nthat members of UCL\u2019s\nruling council have been\nexcluded from decisions\nover the expansion. In a\nletter, Sir Terence said that\nProfessor Michael Arthur,\nUCL\u2019s provost, and Dame\nDeAnne Julius, chair of\nthe ruling council, were\n\u201cintent on driving through\na programme of rapid expansion of UCL, exposing\nnecessary due to financial\nconcerns. It was reported\nthat plans may be underway to increase the size\nto 60,000 students in the\nnear future, as universities\nstruggle to keep up in in-creasingly-global league\ntables.\nRex Knight, UCL\u2019s\nvice-provost for opera-tions, told the meeting\nthat dropping student\nnumbers to 20 or 30,000\nwould have \u201cpretty appalling\u201d consequences for\nthe university.\nA key aspect of this\nexpansion is the development of a new campus in\neast London, located on\nthe Olympic Park. \u2018UCL\nEast\u2019, which will cover\n4.63 hectares, is due to\ncomplete its first phase\nby 2021, and will provide\nresources for 4,000 stu-dents. The total cost of\nthe project is expected to\nreach \u00a3483 million.\n93 days. Last year The\nGuardian revealed that\nmorale among UCL staff\nwas at \u201can all-time low\u201d,\nwith nearly 70% of staff\nsurveyed feeling it was\nnot well-managed. Less\nthan 10% of staff felt that\nthe increase in student\nnumbers would improve\nUCL.\nUCL, a member of the\nRussell Group, is regularly ranked among the\ntop higher education institutions in the world. In\nthis year\u2019s Times Higher\nEducation rankings they\nplaced 16th\n, down from\n14th\ntwo years ago. Many\nsee the move to expand\nas indicative of increased\npressures being placed on\nhigher education institu-tions.\nLondon Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham\n(LBHF), comes following\na year-long consultation\nwith businesses and local\nresidents.\nThe southern site will\ninclude a number of new\nfeatures, including a hotel,\nretail space, and new\nhouses. It will also feature\nconnections between the\ntwo sides of the campus,\nincluding a new land\nbridge over the Central\nLine railway tracks.\nUp to 370 homes will\nbe built on the site, in two\nbuildings of 17 and 32\nstories, the latter of which\nalready has planning per-mission. A portion of the\nhouses will be provided\nat below-market rates to\nImperial key workers,\nwho include early career\nresearchers and Imperial\nNHS staff.\nThere are also plans\nto build a 9,000m2\nhotel,\nwith up to 150 bedrooms,\nand provide 13,500m2\nof\nspace for retail, leisure,\nand food and drink outlets.\nThe majority of the\nspace will be used for\nresearch and business\nspace: 178,000m2\nwill be\ndedicated to both College\nresearch projects, and\nbusinesses who \u201chelp\ntranslate this work into\ncommercial applications\nwhich benefit society\u201d.\nProfessor Neil Alford,\nAssociate Provost (Ac-ademic Planning), said\nthe campus was \u201can\nexciting new chapter in\nthe College\u2019s history\u201d.\nHe said the masterplan\n\u201crepresents a long term\ncommitment to the White\nCity community.\u201d\nImperial College first\nbought land in White City\nin 2009, and the northern site has been under\nconstruction since 2012.\nThe Molecular Sciences\nResearch Hub, which is\ndue to open in 2018, will\nprovide the new home for\nthe Department of Chemistry.\nChemistry students are\ndue to make the move\nover the coming year.

Most of the\nteam members hopped\non the minibus at 5 am\nSaturday morning, with\nthe mission to beat the\nremaining members\ncomfortably driving by\ncar. Those on the minibus\nwere instead graced with a\nfantastic music selection,\nthe continuous chat provided by Aidan (our social\nsailor and second team\ncaptain, out of action due\nto being punched in the\nface by a Chelsea fan), but\nmost importantly, a taste\nof Fraser\u2019s exemplary\ndriving.\nUpon our arrival to\nDraycote Water, we\nsaw the morning breeze\npicking up. The wind\nconditions however were\nthe least of our concerns\nwhen we realised one of\nour second team\u2019s crews,\nMichal Wojnowski, was\n\u201cThe cocktail\nmasked a\nsubstantial\namount of\nspirits under\nthe flavour of\norange squash\nand\u2018Blue Bolt\u2019\nenergy drink\u201d\n\u201cICSC finished\nin a highly\nrespectable\nsecond\nposition\noverall\u201d\nnowhere to be seen. It\nlater transpired that he had\na fun night out at Oxford,\nattempted to climb\nover the fence of Christ\nCollege and missed his\nride to Warwick with the\nOxford sailing team.\nDespite this, racing\nhad to go on. Third team\ncrew, Radhika, temporarily joined second team\n(Imperial White) to race\nagainst our first team\n(Imperial Blue) in the\nfirst race of the whole\nevent. Luck wasn\u2019t on\nher side, however, as\nboth her and Ariane from\nImperial White ended up\nthe water after capsizing\nsoon after the rounding\nthe second mark of the\nrace. This was more than\nenough of an advantage\nfor the Blues to finish in\na winning combination\nwith boats in 1st, 2nd and\n3rd places. Apart from\ntemperamental winds, our\nteams were also dealing\nwith a biased umpire \u2013\nAidan, our injured second\nteam captain was also\numpiring the event, and in\nour opinion, did not do a\nvery good job of it!\nThe day progressed as\nthe teams battled strong\nwinds and got used to\nracing in different conditions and competing\nagainst different teams.\nThe racing finished for\nthe day around mid-af-ternoon, when the sun\nhad already set, and our\nsailing kit was sufficiently\nwet from hiking out on the\nboats, the persistent rain,\nand earlier capsizes.\nAs per usual, the\nevening social demanded\nthe participants to show\nup in attributed costumes.\nOur teams brought their\nmost improvised game\nin the disguises of; the 3\nlittle pigs, blind mice and\nPinocchio. The traditional\ncurry meal served both\nas comfort food from an\nexhaustive day, and a\nplace to start pre-ing for\nthe night ahead. Shout out\nto Warwick University\nSailing Club for providing\nus with copious amounts\nof their famous beverage\naptly named \u201cEliminator\u201d.\nDespite each sailor being\nallocated a generous 1 litre\nportion of the drink, many\nbottles were stolen from\nother teams and could be\nfound hidden under the\ntable. The cocktail masked\na substantial amount of\nspirits under the flavour of\norange squash and \u2018Blue\nBolt\u2019 energy drink and our\nsocial sec, Aidan, made\nsure every sailor had a\nsufficient quantity of it\nbefore we left the curry\nhouse. The rest of the\nnight comes in separate\nflashbacks to most of\nthe team members, but\neveryone was sure to have\nhad a splendid night out at\nWarwick.\nSunday morning didn\u2019t\nallow any time for a\nhangover, as the 3 teams\nhad to wake up at 7.30\nam for a bright and early\nstart to sailing. The results\nfrom the previous day\nre-distributed our teams in\ndifferent fleets; Imperial\nBlue were in Gold fleet\naiming to get into finals,\nwhile Imperial White\nand Red were sailing\nin Bronze fleet and had\nmore room to play new\ntactics whilst still getting\npositive results. With\nlonger waits in between\nraces due to even stronger\nwind conditions, some\nof our sailors were keen\non getting more time\non the water by joining\nother teams with missing\nmembers. Toby Freeland,\none of Imperial White\u2019s\nhelms, decided to sail\nwith the Swansea alumni\nteam. We unwittingly\ndiscovered on the water\nthat he was sailing against\nImperial Blue in the\nsemi-finals match of the\nwhole competition. This\nprompted calls of \u201cyou\nbetter capsize Toby\u201d and\n\u201cif you win a race you\u2019re\nnot getting a ride back to\nLondon\u201d from members\nof Imperial Blue. Luckily,\nImperial Blue easily\nbreezed through the\nsemi-finals but unfortunately lost to Magdalene\nCollege School in a\nclosely fought finals with\nvery strong winds and\ndubious decisions from\nthe umpires to finish in a\nhighly respectable second\nposition overall.\nThe event was a fantastic way to get ready for\nBUSA Qualifiers (more\nabout that next week),\nand overall a weekend\nfull of great sailing and\nsocialising.

Accompanying\nthem was Coach George\nBurton, ex-GB Olympic\ntrainer, who has provided\na tremendous support, discipline and passed down\na heck of a lot of boxing\nwisdom to everyone he\nhas trained.\nThe event began on\n\u201cCooney has\na distinctive\nstyle, bursting\nwith energy\nand fire\u201d\nFriday the 2nd followed\nby semi-finals and finals\nover the following two\ndays. Burridge and\nCooney made it through\nto semi-finals and finals,\nrespectively, and an unfortunate disqualification\nmade Song unable to\ncontinue through to the\nlater stages.\nCooney, 24, from\nLondon/Ireland brought\nhome Gold after an\noverriding win against\nBirmingham\u2019s Mairi\nKerin in the semi\u2019s and a\nfiery, adrenaline-fuelled\nin the last 10 seconds of\nmadness.\nThe judges made a\nMiss Universe style\nmistake, announcing the\nwrong winner before\nre-crowning Cooney as\nthe true overall champion.\n(She was tremendously\nmodest about the whole\nordeal, even though it was\nindisputable that she had\nwon the first two rounds).\nBurridge, 19, from\nChalfont St. Peter, Buckinghamshire, took home\nBronze after stepping\nup his game in a tough\nfight against 25-year-old,\n3-time BUCS boxing\nchampion, Adinoyi Ozigi,\nfrom Nottingham Trent\nUni. Burridge put up a\ngood fight going toe-to-toe against such a formidable fighter.

    "content": "ARTS\nFRIDAY, 9TH\nFEBRUARY, 2018 FELIX\n20\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGandhi opera Satyagraha returns to London\nT\nhis year brings\nwith it the highly\nanticipated third\nrevival of Philip\nGlass\u2019s iconic Satyagraha, an epic opera based\non Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s\nmemoir My Experiments\nwith Truth. Since its UK\npremi\u00e8re 11 years ago,\nwhich broke box office\nrecords for 20th\ncentury\nopera, Satyagraha, which\nfollows the beginnings\nof Gandhi\u2019s political\nactivism based on principles of civil disobedience\nand non-violence in South\nAfrica, has sustained its\nstatus as the most popular\ncontemporary work to\nbe performed by English\nNational Opera.\nThe production is\ndirected by Phelim McDermott and designed by\nJulian Crouch, co-found-ers of theatre company\nImprobable. The scenery\nand puppetry on stage is\nmanipulated with mastery,\nhowever conductor Karen\nKamensek, a Glass spe-cialist, commands her orchestra with precision and\nsteadiness, which at times\neclipses the happenings\non stage.\nThe libretto is sung\nin Sanskrit, based\non excerpts from the\nBhagavad Gita, without\nsurtitles. Occasionally,\nquotations are projected\nonto the stage, providing\nintrospective material for\nthe audience rather than\nnarrative guidance. Undeniably, it is a work that\nrequires you to rewatch it\nin order to peel back the\nlayers of meaning.\nGlass composed a\ntrilogy of operas based on\nindividuals who changed\nthe world, of which Satyagraha is one. Einstein\non the Beach (1976) is the\nfirst and Akhnaten (1984)\nthe last.\nSet in South Africa\nbetween 1896 and 1913,\nSatyagraha \u2013 the truth\nforce \u2013 explores Gandhi\u2019s\npeaceful resistance\nagainst the discrimination\nhe observed. In a world\nwhere violence and social\ndiscrimination remain\never-relevant, we turn to\nGandhi\u2019s idea of \u2018truthforce\u2019 and Tolstoy\u2019s \u2018universal love\u2019 for solace.\nThe concept of satyagraha is often misunderstood to be limited to\npassive resistance. One\nof the first scenes in the\nopera is at Tolstoy farm,\nwhere Gandhi and his\nallies form a commune\nand commit to not only\nwork on the commune, but\nalso on their own spiritual\ndevelopment. They vow\nto resist the enemy, but do\nso from a place of love,\nthis commitment, they\ndeclare, is the spirit of\n\u2018satyagraha\u2019.\nStillness descends over\nthe London Coliseum,\nonly to be interrupted by\nthe repeating motifs of\nthe cello. Toby Spence\u2019s\npowerful voice adds to the\ncrescendo and the stage\ngradually comes to life.\nThe distinguished tenor\nis a worthy successor to\nAlan Oke who retired\nfrom the role of M.K.\nGandhi, one he had held\nsince the 2007 premi\u00e8re,\nToby Spence, distinguished London-based\ntenor flawlessly preserves\nthe legacy. His grounded\nvoice provides constancy\non the ever-changing\nstage. In his role as\nArjuna, the prince at the\nheart of the Hindu epic\nMahabharata, Eddie\nWade\u2019s booming baritone\nvoice harmonises beautifully with Spence\u2019s as\nthey meditatively chant in\nSanskrit.\nEach act is inspired by\none of the three icons of\nSatyagraha \u2013 Gandhi\u2019s\ninspiration Leo Tolstoy,\nhis contemporary and\nconfidante Rabindranath\nTagore, and the man who\ncarried Gandhi\u2019s legacy\nduring the American Civil\nRights movement, Martin\nLuther King Jr. In grounding the opera in these\nindividuals, Glass is able\nto appreciate the continuity of the principles of\nsatyagraha through time,\nplace, culture and person.\nThe first act, aptly\nnamed Tolstoy, reminds\nus of the essential bond\nbetween Russian novelist\nand a young Gandhi, who\nfounded his ideas about\nnon-violence on Tolstoy\u2019s\ntheories on universal love.\nTolstoy\u2019s letters to Gandhi\nwere a source of reassurance and counselling to\nthe young leader. This\nrelationship defines the\neternal nature of \u2018truth\nforce\u2019 that spans across\nnations.\nThe second act is\ninspiredbyIndianpoetand\nphilosopher Rabindranath\nTagore, who earned the\n1913 Nobel Prize for\nliterature. He sits in an\nalcove above the stage,\nallowing the audience to\nacknowledge the long\nrelationship between\nhimself and Gandhi. Act\nII is filled with pivotal\nscenes that give it a more\ndramatic tone than the first\nact. The presence of Mrs\nAlexander (Sarah Pring),\nthe wife of the Durban\npolice superintendent who\ndefended Gandhi from a\nmob, provides the most\nclimactic scene of the\nact. The mezzo soprano\nPhilip Glass\u2019 iconic work offers a unique opportunity to experience contemporary opera at its finest.\nENO chorus// Donald Cooper\nARTS\nAnmol Patel\nArts Writer\nWhere?

The collection\nwhich won Siken theYaleYounger Poet\u2019s Prize\nin 2004 was lauded by the competition judge\nLouise Gluck as the kind of book that\u201crestored to\npoetry that sense of crucial moment and crucial\nutterance which may indeed be the great genius\nof the form\u201d. From vivid, visceral imagery rooted\nin fast motorbikes, handguns, pills and violence,\nSiken crafts a series of poems that explore\ntenderness and gayness in a world of murderous,\nFelix recommends Valentine's reads\u2026\nThree suggestions for books to set the tone for the holiday through their depictions of romantic love in its many\nforms.\nT\nhe first question is, who is the narrator?\nShe or he is never named, and their\ngender never revealed. \"Why is the\nmeasure of love loss?\" asks the opening\nsentence, and throughout the book we are taken\nthrough the narrator\u2019s clandestine relationship\nwith a married woman, a passionate, convention-defying love affair. As might be expected, their\nlover\u2019s husband, a doctor, comes in the way,\nand reveals to the narrator that their lover has\nleukaemia, a fact that she has been concealing\nfrom the narrator. Using his status as a doctor,\nhe forces the narrator to leave his wife by saying\nthat he cannot have them around while he\nsupervises her treatment. The narrator leaves,\nand we are taken through the whirlwind of her\ngrief and ways to cope, with the text interspersed\nwith narrative descriptions of anatomical body\nparts as an extended metaphor for love and\nloss: \"Shuttered like a fan no-one suspects your\nshoulder blade of wings.\" Written on the Body is\na (sometimes excessive) lyrical journey through\nthe anatomy of passion, love and loss. \u2013 Jingjie\nCheng\nW\nritten when he was 21, Alain de\nBotton\u2019sclassicmusingonromance\nand relationships is an insightful\ndissection of the anatomy of a\nromantic relationship. The story follows the\nunnamed narrator and his relationship with\nChloe, from the point where they met sitting\nnext to each other on a plane to infatuation,\nto the gradual decline and breakdown of their\nrelationship.Ontheway,thenarratormusesabout\nvarious aspects and theories behind romantic\nlove and its associated pitfalls, illustrated with\nspecific events that appear insignificant but are\nultimately telling and uncomfortably familiar to\nanyone who has been in a relationship before.\nFor example, the narrator writes about the \u2018Jesus\ncomplex\u2019 - the tendency for one to feel virtuous\nin the face of suffering, the feeling of superiority\nover one\u2019s oppressors. It is with this attitude that\nhe faces Chloe\u2019s eventual rejection, as a way to\nmove beyond his helpless, needy state before.\nThisisabookthatmaybeuncannytopeoplewho\nhave experienced relationships, but therefore\nalso incredibly enlightening. \u2013 Jingjie Cheng\nWritten on the Body by Jeanette Winterson\nsuicidal homophobia and toxic masculinity\u201cYou\u2019re in a car with a beautiful boy...And you\nfeel like you\u2019ve done something terrible, like\n...shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt...and you\u2019re\ntrying not to tell him that you love him...but he\nreaches over and he touches you, like a prayer\nfor which no words exist, and you feel your heart\ntaking root in your body\u201d. Alternating between\nthe first and second person, Siken\u2019s writing is\nferocious with a vital force; these are poems that\nlinger in the mind long after you\u2019ve turned the\nlast page. \u2013 Indira Mallik\nCrushbyRichardSiken\nEssays in Love by Alain de Botton\n/\n/\nP\ni\nc\na\ndor\n/\n/\nV\ni\nn\nt\nage\n//Yale University Press\n\u2026or the books to help you to forget about romance\nFor those who are content with their own company, or just want to avoid all the sentimental nonsense on the 14th\nthis year.\nT\nhis recommendation is a shout-out to the folks out there who have\nnormalised their loneliness, those\nwho on Valentine\u2019s day are no longer\nbitter about their relationship status, but are\njust having a quiet evening by themselves.\nUnpublished at the time of his death, Jean Jaques\nRousseau, through a series of ten \u2018walks\u2019 (both\nphysically and contemplatively), documents\nhis musings and introspection during his last\ndays of life, attempting to derive some catharsis\nfrom his perceived ill-treatment and disregard\nE\nveryone gets lonely sometimes, and\nholiday periods with their ubiquitous,\naggressive marketing geared towards\ncouples, or families can feel isolating for\nmany. Part memoir, part thesis, Laing wrote The\nLonely City after a break-up. She travelled to New\nYork alone to seek solace in the work of artists\nwhose work to different degrees have been\ndefined by the particular brand of loneliness\nthat arises in metropolitan cities, where despite\nphysical proximity to millions, one can easily go\ndays without having a conversation - let alone\none that is truly meaningful or fosters kinship.\nIn this lyrical, life-affirming book Laing explores\nthe complex factors that lead to urban loneliness\nusing the work of Edward Hopper, Andy Warhol,\nand David Wojnarowicz amongst others as a\nfoundation - it is an ode to their art, and a call to\narms to forge a more connected world. Laing is an\nempathetic, thoughtful author with a talent for\ncrafting perfect, deceptively simple sentences.\nNot only does The Lonely City deal with important\nissues, it is a joy to read - it should be required\nreading. \u2013 Indira Mallik\nT\nhere is romance in A Thousand Splendid\nSuns and it is both heart-warming and\ngut-wrenching, but nowhere near as\npowerful as the friendship of the two\nfemale protagonists.

When Mariam\u2019s abusive\nhusband takes Laila as his second wife, it seems\ntheir situations may never improve. As if matters\ncouldn\u2019t be any worse, they live in war-torn\nAfghanistan. The plot sometimes seems like a\nnever-ending barrage of hardship and pain. Still,\nthe joyful moments would not be so momentous\nwithout the suffering. Even when they seem\nbroken, any love-life unobtainable, equality a\nmyth, the women help each other to persist\nthrough their mutual love of Laila\u2019s children and\neach other. Without Mariam, the novel would be\na normal romance or lost love and longing. But\nMariamexistsandcannotberemovedfromLaila\u2019s\nbeing. She is a reminder that true love need not\nbe romantic and that great strength can be found\nthrough friendship; her character has stayed with\nme for many years. \u2013 Alice Peberdy\nThe Lonely City by Olivia Laing\nfrom others. We start with a bitter and lonely\nRousseau, expressing his despair at the way his\nwork and person was perceived by his fellow\nmen. This morphs into an elegant review of\nhimself (introspection) and of society at large\n(nature of people) and the tension between\nthe joy and sorrow of isolation. Whilst it can be\npainful to vicariously engage with these reveries,\nit sheds light on how Rousseau and by extension\nthe reader engage with the nexus between\nactions or inactions and our inner thoughts and\nunhappiness. \u2013 Pavan Inguva\nReveries of a Solitary Walker by Jean Jacques Rousseau\nA Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini\n/\n/\nB\nl\no\no\nm\ns\nb\nury\n/\n/\nP\ni\nc\na\ndor\n//Penguin Classics\n\n"

This made\nsome moviegoers unhap-py. So, they put down their\npopcorn, picked up their\npicket signs and marched\nover to Hollywood\nBoulevard demanding\nthat film studio executives increase the racial\ndiversity of characters in\ntheir films. The executives\nlistened and over the next\nfew years, racially-diverse\nclassics such as Lawrence\nof Arabia, To Kill a\nMockingbird and Guess\nWho\u2019s Coming to Dinner\nwere greenlit by film\nproducers. Hollywood\nhad increased the heterogeneity of characters on\nthe big screen and so the\nprotesters put down their\npicket signs and went\nback home.\nAnd for a while, people\nwere happy. But then they\ndecided that even though\nHollywood had widened\nthe representation of\ndifferent ethnic groups on\nthe big screen, they often\nportrayed these groups in\nan unfavourable light. So,\nin the early 1970s, they\nonce again decided to take\ntheir anger to the streets\nof Hollywood. One of the\nactivists at this time was\nMarlon Brando \u2013 regularly regarded as one of the\ngreatest actors of the 20th\ncentury and particularly\nfamous for his portrayal of\nVito Corleone in The Godfather (1972). Having just\nwon an Academy Award\nfor his performance in the\nfilm, Brando declined to\naccept his prize \u201cowing\nto the poor treatment of\nNative Americans in the\nfilm industry\u201d. Instead, the\nNative American activist,\nSacheen Littlefeather,\nwho represented Brando\nat the awards ceremony,\nused the opportunity to\ndeliver a fiery rebuke of\nthe Academy of Motion\nPictures and Arts.\nThat speech was not an\nisolated event, it sparked a\nwave of diversity protests\nthat have been troubling\nthe Hollywood elite\never since. Much of the\ncriticism regarding the\nportrayal of non-white\ncharacters in Hollywood\nproductions began to\ncentre around the concept\nof the \u201cwhite-saviour\u201d\nfilm \u2013 a cinematic trope in\nwhich a white protagonist\nis portrayed as a messianic figure who attains\nmoral enlightenment after\nsacrificing a comfortable\nlivelihood in order to\n(physically or morally)\nrescue characters of\ncolour.\nDespite the protests, the\nwhite-saviour narrative\ngained popularity amongst\naudiences. The film that\nkicked-off the genre was\nthe 1962 cinematic adaptation of Harper Lee\u2019s\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\u2013 a story where a white\nlawyer unsuccessfully\ndefends unfairly accused\nblack clients but nonethe-less, receives praise for\nhis efforts. Even though\nthe film was successful,\nit was only until the late\n1980s and early 1990s\nthat the genre really took\noff. During this period,\nwhite-saviour stories\nwere released frequently\nenough for almost every\nfilm in the genre to be recognized as an instance of\na more specific narrative.\nThere was the story\nabout the white coach\nthat leads inner-city sports\nteams to championship\nsuccess (Wildcats [1986]\nSunset Park [1996], Glory\nRoad [2006]); the story\nabout a white teacher that\nsacrifices a comfortable\nlife in order to educate underprivileged non-white\nstudents (The Principal\n[1987], Dangerous Minds\n[1995], Finding Forrester\n[2000]); the story about\nwhite adventurers that\nrescue a benevolent\nsociety from hostile\ninvaders (Dances with\nWolves [1990], Gran\nTorino [2008], Avatar\n[2009]); and in homage\nto Harper Lee\u2019s epic, the\nstory about the white\nlawyer that defends\nunjustly accused African-Americans (A Time\nTo Kill [1996], Amistad\n[1997]).\nNot all these films\nsucceeded, but the ones\nthat did were often\nbranded by film critics\nas earnest attempts to\nstart a conversation on\nrace in an industry that\nthroughout its history,\nhad failed to capture the\nreal-life experiences of\nnon-white communities\nin the United States.\nNonetheless, a few critics\ncontended that while\nsuch films did succeed in\ncrafting more racially-di-verse landscapes, they\noften did so at the expense\nof the very characters that\nthey were meant to be\nabout. The claim is that\nby depicting non-whites\nas dependent on whites,\nsuch films only reinforce\nthe preconceived bias\nthat non-white characters\ncannot be the agents of\ntheir own destiny. To\ngive an example, in her\nreview of the Academy\nAward-winning film,\nThe Blind Side (2009),\nin which a white woman\nrescues a black teenager\nfrom an impoverished\nchildhood and supports\nhim throughout his high\nschool and college years,\nMelissa Anderson, former\nsenior film critic at The\nVillage Voice, stated that\n\u201cthe movie peddles the\nmost insidious kind of\nracism, one in which\nwhiteys are virtuous\nsaviours, coming to the\nrescue of African-Americans who become superfluous in narratives that\nare supposed to be about\nthem.\u201d\nThat view seems\nto have become more\npopular over time, so\nmuch so that it is now the\nnorm amongst the liberal\nintelligentsia of Hollywood. This being the case,\nthe white-saviour genre\nseems to be slowly going\nout of fashion in favour of\nfilms that portray people\nof colour as their own\nheroes \u2013 for instance, in\nAva DuVernay\u2019s Selma\n(2014), Theodore Melfi\u2019s\nHidden Figures (2016)\nand Marvel\u2019s upcoming\nfeature, Black Panther\n(2018).\nIndeed, the backlash\nagainst white-saviour\nmovies has been so intense\nthat even the seemingly\ninnocuous musicals, La\nLa Land (2016) and The\nGreatest Showman (2017)\n\u201cPeople generally see what they look for\u201d// Universal International Pictures\nMoonlight, starring Janelle Mon\u00e0e and Mahershala Ali, was the first all-black cast to\nwin Best Picture // Wikimedia\n\u201cHollywood\ndidn\u2019t make\nmany films\nabout\nrace. This\nmade some\nmoviegoers\nunhappy\u201d\n9\n1\n%\nw\nh\ni\nt\ne\n\u201cThe Oscars\nseem to\nbe overly\nconcerned\nwith whether\na film director\nis black or\nwhite, female\nor male, Asian\nor Hispanic,\nyoung or old\u201d\nhave been accused of belonging to the genre. Last\nyear, La La Land was the\nearly front-runner in the\nrace for the Best Picture\nOscar at the 89th\nAcademy\nAwards, but after a few\ncritics lamented the lack\nof African-Americans in\na film that sees a white\nman save jazz, the movie\nquickly lost momentum\nand eventually, the race.\nInstead, Moonlight\n(2017) became the first\nfilm with an all-black\ncast to win Best Picture;\nand even more notably,\nthe ceremony had the\nmost black winners of\nany Academy Awards,\never. That is partly a\nresult of the fact that over\nthe previous two years,\nthe Academy had come\nunder a new wave of more\nintense scrutiny for the\nlack of racial diversity\namong the nominees in\nmajor categories. It wasn\u2019t\nsomething new to them;\nthe Academy \u2013 largely,\nwhite old men in their 60s\n\u2013 had weathered this type\nof storm before.\nBut unlike previous\nwaves, this time, the\nyounger, conventionally\nsuccessful, yet disenfranchised Hollywood actors\nand directors leading\nthe charge had armies of\nTwitter followers behind\nthem to champion their\ncause. As soon as the\nnominations for the 87th\nand 88th\nAcademy Awards\nwere announced, hashtags\nlike #OscarsSoWhite\nand #WhiteOscars began\nmaking rounds amongst\nthe keyboard activists of\nthe Twitterverse. Though,\nthan a game of identity\npolitics that ignores\nartistic masterpieces and\ninstead rewards the most\nvocal identitarian move-ments. Take, for example,\nthe newly-minted hashtag\n#LatinosLeftOut. The\nhashtag, coined in\nresponse to the lack of\nHispanic film-makers\namong the recently announced Oscar nominees,\nis yet another example\nof how representa-tion-through-Oscar-nom-ination is damaging the\nfuture of film. By shaping\nthe entire conversation\non film industry diversity\naround the metric of Oscar\nsuccess, the Hollywood\nelite have constructed a\nzero-sum game that is\ntrapping them in a vortex\nof never-ending diversity\nprotests. For a black actor\nto win, a Hispanic one\nmust lose; for a female\ndirector to win, a male\none must lose, for a the-matically-familiar film to\nsucceed, a more contemporary one may have to\nfail. It\u2019s getting to a point\nwhere future awards nomination processes may\ndepend more on activism\nagainst under-representa-tion than the artistic merits\nof a film.\nWhen Ava DuVernay\u2019s\nSelma missed out on\nBest Picture at the 87th\nAcademy Awards and\nF. Gary Gray\u2019s Straight\nOutta Compton wasn\u2019t\nnominated for the same\nprize the following year,\nseveral liberal media\noutlets castigated the\nAcademy for ignoring\nblack actors. However, the\nproblem with such an assessment is that it appears\nto fly in the face of the\nnumbers. African-Americans constitute 12.6% of\nthe U.S. population and\nsince 2000, 10% of Oscar\nnominations have gone\nblack actors. Assuming\nthat most black actors in\nHollywood are indeed,\nAfrican-Americans, then\nit appears that black\nactors are not really being\nignored by the Academy.\nThe media pundits protesting under-representa-tion of different groups\nat the Oscars seem to be\noverly concerned with\nwhether a film director is\nblack or white, female or\nmale, Asian or Hispanic,\nyoung or old. An artistic\npurist would say that\nsuch factors shouldn\u2019t\nhave much to do with a\nfilm\u2019s chances of Oscar\nsuccess. Ava DuVernay\u2019s\nomission in the Best\nDirector category at the\n87th\nAwards should not be\nviewed through the lens\nof whether the academy\nignored her because she\nis black and female but\nshould instead be recognized as a unique instance\nof a good film-maker\nthat was not awarded the\nrecognition she deserved.\nNot unlike several other\nactors, screenwriters, and\ndirectors that have been\nsnubbed by the Academy\nafter producing outstanding work. And this leads\nto my last point. There is\nno industry on the face of\nthe Earth that celebrates\nitself as much as Hollywood. Awards season\ntypically kicks off around\nNovember with the\nGotham awards and then\ndrags on for a further three\nmonths, culminating with\nthe Oscars at the end of\nFebruary. Between those\ntwo events, the eventual\nBest Picture winner can\nexpect to acquire well over\na hundred nominations\nat major and semi-major\nawards ceremonies,\nwinning roughly half of\nthem.\nBut what is it about\nsuch films that make them\nworthy of that coveted\nprize of Best Picture?\nWhat magic lies between\nthose opening and closing\ncredits that is strong\nenough to draw the universal admiration of the\nacademy? Well, almost\nby definition, artworks\ndo not lend themselves\nto objective assessment;\neverybody will have\ntheir own unique opinion\nregarding the best films\nof the year and those\ndifferences in opinion are\nlikely to result in some\nheated argument among\nfilm critics, professional\nfilm-makers and media\npundits, alike. Some will\npraise the summer staple\nof superhero-heavy block-busters, others will brand\nthem infantile garbage;\nsome will sing the praises\nof avant-garde novelties,\nothers will dismiss them\nas fashionable nonsense\n\u2013 there is rarely consensus\nin art. Even as I write this\npiece, there are about\nfour films that still have\na realistic shot at this\nyear\u2019s Best Picture prize,\nso perhaps the best way\nof determining whether\na film is Oscar-worthy,\nis to simply try to make\nthe Academy more representative of the wider\nHollywood film industry.\nOnce that\u2019s done, let the\nchips fall where they may.\nCurrent make-up of the Academy // Felix\ngoing by the triumph\nof Moonlight at the last\nyear\u2019s awards, it appears\nthat this brand of crowd-sourced criticism has left\na mark.\nCertainly, there is\nnothing wrong with\nhaving a more diverse\npool of nominees at the\nOscars, but if that comes at\nthe expense of artistically\nsuperior films, then in a\nway, it is a loss for the art\nof film altogether. In such\na world, the Oscars are\nreduced to nothing more\n9% non-white\nEthnicity\nGender\n2\n4\n%\nw\no\nm\nen\n76%\nmen\n\n"

Fintan initially\npromised to continue working towards this aim, but\nthe Union has since shifted focus to the Wellbeing\nRepresentation Network (WBRN).\n1Implement student \u201cteaching\nconsultants\u201d who will be paid to work\nwith lecturers and improve performance \u2013\nIN PROGRESS\nWhile students at Imperial have a number of\nways of making their views on their teaching known\n\u2013 speaking to their academic reps is one way, as is\nfinally filling out that SOLE feedback you\u2019ve been\nputting off for weeks \u2013 but this year has seen the beginning of a new development. Called StudentShapers, and similar to the UCL Changemakers scheme\nthe project will be a partnership between College and\nthe Union, aimed at allowing students to help shape\neducation at Imperial. A director has already been\nrecruited \u2013 on a salary of around \u00a360,000 \u2013 and the\nscheme is scheduled to launch next year.\n2Extend the undergraduate teaching assistant role outside the Physics Department \u2013 SUCCESS\nUndergraduate Teaching Assistants (UTAs) are\nthose helpers you might have seen in your labs,\neagerly giving you advice on why your experiments\naren\u2019t working, or \u2013 in some cases \u2013 desperately\nfighting off a hangover. This year has seen the UTAs\nrolled out to a couple of other departments: EEE and\nBioengineering students can now look forward to\nseeing them in their labs.\n3Ensure coursework is returned within a ten\nworking day period \u2013 IN PROGRESS\nThis year\u2019s NSS results highlighted a number of\nproblems with assessment and feedback at Imperial.\nThe most common benchmark at Imperial for getting\nmarks back for coursework is ten working days, but it\nis not clear how often this has been met. Since October,\nNick has been running an audit on all Year 1 assessed\nwork, seeing when feedback was supposed to be\nreceived, and when it was actually received. The report\nfrom this is scheduled to be presented this month.\n4Ensure that students are consulted\nduring the design, implementation, and\nevaluation of major changes to education \u2013\nIN PROGRESS\nAt the end of the last academic year, the College\nlaunched their new Learning and Teaching Strategy,\nled by Professor Simone Buitendijk, Vice Provost\n(Education). The Strategy will prioritise \u201cthe review\nand redesign of our curricula\u201d, and, as such, restructuring education will take a top priority this year. It\nis vital, therefore, that students are consulted on this.\nSince coming into office, Nick has been working with\nDepartmental Reps and Academic Affairs Officers to\ndraft a framework for how students should be consulted\nduring this review, which is scheduled to be presented\nto College this term.\n5Improve communication between\ndepartments and academic reps through\nexisting channels \u2013 SUCCESS\nThis year, attendance at ERB (Education and\nRepresentation Board, for those of you not knee-deep\nin Union hackery) has sharply increased from 30\nattendees to 49, with three meetings remaining in the\nyear. Nick might argue it\u2019s because of his sparkling\npersonality, but attendance of senior members of\nthe College, including the Vice Provost (Education),\nmight have something to do with it\u2026\nNick Burstow\nDeputy President (Education)\n//Nate\nMacabuag\n//Nate\nMacabuag\n//Nate\nMacabuag\n1Review the Union's room booking\nsystem \u2013 IN PROGRESS\nTom Bacarese-Hamilton\nDeputy President (Clubs & Socs)\nAnyone trying to navigate the system through\nwhich Imperial deals with room requests, will\nhave faced familiar problems. Reforming the\nroom booking system has been on a priority for a\nnumber of DPCS, stretching back to at least 2014.\nTom has been meeting with the College, who\nare also looking at reforming the room booking\nsystem. A pilot group for the new system is due to\nbe launched later this year.\n2Ensure that Union jobs and roles have\nclear descriptions \u2013 STILL WAITING\nOpenness was one of Tom\u2019s big manifesto\nareas, and while the Union has done work towards\nbecoming a more open organisation \u2013 the new\nsection of the website for the elections is an\nexample \u2013 there can still be confusion about who\neveryone is. Going on the \u2018Contact Us\u2019 webpage\nstill results in a list of names and roles, leaving\nyou to figure out the difference between Student\nActivities and Student Development. This will be\non Tom\u2019s to-do list for later this year.\n3Generate recommendations for\nsponsorship costs based on size \u2013 IN\nPROGRESS\nHow much is your time worth? What about the\nback of your club hoody? Your email signature?\nFrom the sponsorship review that has been com-pleted, Tom and the Student Activities team plan\nto develop a system so that clubs know exactly\nhow much they should be charging KPMG et al.\nwhen they hit them up for sponsorship. A report\nhas been produced, but we\u2019re waiting on it to be\nincorporated into a new training package.\n4Create a new reporting system for\nminibus damage \u2013STILL WAITING\nThe Union\u2019s fleet of minibuses are an invaluable resource for clubs who need to shuttle around\nLondon (and beyond) \u2013 heading to matches, going\non camping trips, and even delivering issues of\nFelix! Tom\u2019s plans for a reporting system have\nnot got off the ground yet, but he is looking into\npossible options for delivering it.\nMatt Blackett\nDeputy President (Finance & Services)\n1Bring in pre-poured pints to ACC nights\n\u2013 GOAL SHIFTED\nPre-poured pints have become something of a\nUnion legend, as people envision an ACC night\nfree of queues, but full of lager. Matt trialled pre-poured pints at the first ACC night of the year, but\nit didn\u2019t work for a number of reasons \u2013 staffing\nissues, problems with drink choice. He is now\nlooking into other ways of speeding things up as\npart of the tender process.\n2Establish a coach service to Heston and\nHarlington \u2013 IN PROGRESS\nMatt was one of the three OTs who promised to\nlook into establishing a Heston coach service, and\nthe task has now fallen to him. He has spent last\nterm looking into usage of minibuses, and running\na trial service on Monday evenings. The rest of\nthis year will be spent reviewing the proposal, and\ncoordinating the service with pitch bookings for\nnext year. It will feed into an overall examination\nof the minibus system, as the coach service takes\npressure of minibuses.\n3Improve range and quality of food on\noffer \u2013 STILL WAITING\nFor those who think curly fries and beef burgers\naren\u2019t enough, prepare to be disappointed\u2026 there\nhave been no substantial menu changes as of yet\nthis year, and the ongoing tender process is looking\nat beverages on offer only.\n4Increase external income to the Union,\nincluding centralised sponsorship \u2013 IN\nPROGRESS\nAs part of his remit as DPFS, Matt is responsible for looking at the cash flows in and out of\nthe Union, including income from external sources\n\u2013 sponsorship and investments, namely. He has\nbeen working with Rhidian Thomas, the Union\u2019s\nEthics and Environment Officer, to ensure the\nUnion begins to divest from fossil fuels, while also\nmaintaining returns on investments. Plans for centralised sponsorship got off to a rocky start, after\ndelays to the recruitment of a new Sales and Sponsorship Manager, but someone should be coming\ninto the role shortly. There\u2019s also the money they\ngot from including Bud Light in the bars\u2026\nAlex 'Chippy' Compton\nUnion President\n1Commit to establishing staff and\nOT time at non-South Kensington\ncampuses \u2013 SUCCESS\nThe majority of this year\u2019s OT team are medical\nstudents, so you might think they need no incentive\nto head over to Charing Cross, or other campuses.\nThis year student-facing Union staff and OTs have\nbeen spending more time at other campuses, with\nan estimated 7-8 trips out to Reynolds, and more\nscheduled for the rest of the term.\n2Create a buddy scheme for students\nreturning from Interruption of Studies\n(IoS) \u2013 IN PROGRESS\nIn October, it was announced that a scheme\nhad been launched parallel to Mums and Dads,\nwhich would pair students returning from IoS with\na parent from their new cohort to facilitate the\nreturn to study, which can often be daunting. The\nscheme has thus far been quite small, but Chippy\nis planning on developing it further, and launching\nit at the start of the next academic year.\n3Ensure counselling triage\nappointments are available within ten\nCollege days \u2013 IN PROGRESS\nAs previously mentioned, the College counselling service has long been a sticking point for\nstudents at Imperial, who are highly likely to\nreport mental stresses and mental health problems.\nWhile counselling isn\u2019t the only solution, improving resources to the counselling service is a must\nin the coming years. While it is College procedure\nto have an appointment within ten working days,\nthis still isn\u2019t being met. The ongoing wellbeing\nstrategy will aim to address this.\n4Protected lunchtimes when timetabled\nacross two sites \u2013 IN PROGRESS\nIt\u2019s a familiar problem for some students: how\ncan you go from one campus to another, while still\nhaving enough time to queue up for Tanpopo in\nthe JCR? A classic dilemma. Students should have\nat least an hour of lunch, which is kept separate\nfrom time needed for travel. The curriculum\nreview, which is part of the Learning and Teaching\nstrategy, should address this issue with timings.\n\n"

Initially\nintended to last until the\nend of January 2018, it\nhas since been extended\nto the end of February.\nDuring the trial period\nthe involved catering\noutlets do not accept\ncash payments, but only\npayments by credit cards,\ndebit cards, and Yoyo.\nThe College says that the\ncashless trial is intended\nto reduce queuing times.\nIf this trial is not opposed\nby significant numbers of\npeople, it is highly probable that the College will\ninfinitely extend the trial\nand thus permanently ban\ncash from its premises.\nAn avid and passionate\ncash payer myself, I vehemently oppose any means\nto impair my freedom\nof choice. That goes for\nstandard things like pro-fession, hobbies, friends\netc., but also extends to the\nmethod of payment. Cash\nis a valid and legal tender,\nand I see no reason to\nprohibit it at the College.\nEvery year, many people\nfrom outside Imperial \u2013\ncontractors, visitors, and\nfreshly-started students\nand staff \u2013 attend the\ncollege and might not yet\nhave a bank account or\ncredit card (for whatever\nreason). They would be\ndenied the opportunity to\nbuy a coffee or snack.\nOn a bigger-than-Col-lege perspective, I believe\nthat \u2013 amidst global financial upheaval, banking\ncrises, and rising debt \u2013\nthe removal of cash would\nfurther virtualize money,\nand could lead to unpredictable consequences and\nbubbles. Bitcoin seems to\nbe a precursor.\ndesbank is that cash is still\nrequired, and the freedom\nof choice for users should\nbe upheld. The World\nEconomic Forum also\nagrees that cash is a direct\nlink between people\nand central banks and\nserves to establish trust\nand public acceptance of\ncentral banks.\nOther problematic\nissues of cashless societies are employment\nopportunities. A recent\nreport by PWC examines\nthe likelihood of job\nlosses due to automation.\nIt shows that disciplines\nlike retail, food service,\nand manufacturing are especially endangered. It is\nhighly likely that \u2013 amidst\na move toward cashless\nImperial \u2013 several cashiers\nand other catering staff\nmight be laid off. While\nthere is not enough space\nto cover all the problems\nwith going cashless \u2013 and\nI could go on forever \u2013\nthere are other issues,\nthink it is very disappointing to see that a College\nwhich prides itself on\ndiversity and freedom,\nand celebrates events such\nas LGBT History Month,\nis willing to take away the\nfundamental freedom of\npayment choice.\nI hope that I made my\narguments clear, and that\nstudents \u2013 irrespective\nwhether they prefer cash\nor cashless payments \u2013\nwill join me in opposing\nthe ban on cash payments.\nAs a cashless payer, it\nmight not be directly\nrelevant to you, but the\nimplications are bigger\nthan you might think.\nFeedback on the\ncashless trial can be\nsubmitted at the following\ncontact form until the\nend of February: http://\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/food-and-drink/contact-us/\nfeedback/\nMoving to cashless can have a large impact on many areas of life // CC\n\u201cThere are\nconcerns\naround privacy\nand security\nin giving the\ngovernment\nand central\nbanks\ncomplete\ncontrol of\nassets\u201d any statistical or scientific\nevaluation of the reason\nfor the long queuing\ntimes. They also have not\nshown that the reason is\nthe payment procedure\nitself, rather than more\nfundamental issues like\ntoo many customers\narriving at the same time\nor time lost due to having\nto wait for a certain dish.\nIt is also unlikely that\nthere will be any significant improvements of the\nqueuing times by squeezing out the remaining\n20% of cash customers,\nwith College claiming\nthat 80% of payments\nare already cashless. It is\ndifficult to comment on\nthe College\u2019s arguments,\nsince they have provided\nvirtually none, other than\na claim that some people\nhave complained about\nqueuing times.\nOn a personal level, I\nAvocados and drugs? Yes, they are related \u2013\nand in a very toxic way\nThe West\u2019s thirst for these sweet, buttery fruits should be contrasted with the potential\nconsequences millenial food fads can have on producers.\nCOMMENT\nJennifer Eden\nComment Writer\nT\nhis week I was\nsupposed to\ntalk about the\nImperial College\nEndowment Fund. But\ngiven the post mortem\nhas been carried out and\nImperial students have got\nback to thinking about the\nscience stuff, I thought\nI\u2019d write about drugs and\navocadoes.\nLet\u2019s start with the\nlatter. They\u2019re green,\nthey\u2019re clean and a fruit,\nnot a vegetable. They\nalso contain approximately four grams of\nprotein and have helped\nfacilitate surging trends\nin veganism, \u2018raw\u2019 eating\nand all round healthiness.\nSome talk so highly about\nthem you would think they\nare the underlying cause\nof this generational shift,\nsuch are their properties.\nIn the UK alone avocado\nsales increased by \u00a329.8m\nfrom 2016 to 2017 and in\n2015 the US consumed\n4 billion of the damn\nthings. The Hass Avocado\nBoard (real thing)\nrecorded 92,535,729 kg\nof avocados produced\nworldwide in 2018 so far,\nthis being estimated to hit\n405,195,664 kg by July.\nIn short, our increased\ndemand for them in the\nWest has seen prices soar\nand the profits roll in. So\nfar, so good for consumers\nand exporters alike.\nOne such exporter,\nMexico, produces 45% of\nthe world\u2019s green gold. It\nis also a country plagued\nby drug cartels. For all\nthe millions and millions\nthat have been invested in\nthe war against drugs, organised crime still seems\nto hold Mexico in a state\nof terror. In fact, last year\nwas the country\u2019s most\nviolent on record as homicides totalled 29,168. Of\ncourse not all these deaths\ncan be attributed to the\ncartels, but an alarming\nproportion are.\nWhat\u2019s the link\nbetween avocados and\ncartels? Well, that\u2019s\nsimple. Whenever hardworking people are evidently prospering, there\u2019s\nalways a parasite wanting\ntheir slice of the action.\nMichoac\u00e1n, a province\nknown to be the avocado\ncapital of Mexico, is the\nprime example, having\npreviously been burdened\nby the parasitic tendencies\nof cartels. On noticing\nfarmers\u2019 lucrative activ-ities, cartels would force\npayments upon the crop\u2019s\nproduction, taking their\ncut as a sort of protection\nmoney. If payments failed\nto be met, threats, kidnap\nand murder would follow.\nThus a tense, fractured\natmosphere pervades in\nmany parts of Michoac\u00e1n,\nand all to keep the shelves\nof our supermarkets sufficiently stocked.\nOn a broader spectrum,\nit does seem to be a recurring pattern that whenever\na new superfood, new fad\nor even new must-have\npet emerges, with the huge\neconomic prospects come\nunforeseen problems. Unforeseen because demand\nbecomes so intense so\nfast that the whole nature\nof the suppliers\u2019 original\nbusiness has to aggressively evolve or itself be\nhijacked. In Peru there\nwere rumblings that the\npopularity of quinoa in\nwealthy countries may\nbe outpricing Andeans,\nfor whom it has been a\nOprah says it\u2019s good on\na Monday, there\u2019s world\nconsensus by Tuesday\nmorning. And so my\npoint is this: there\u2019s\nno time to think of the\nconsequences. Suppliers\nknow that demand must\nbe met immediately,\nmoney needs to be made\nand the opportunity taken\nbefore our goldfish brains\nturn to the next exciting\nthing. Many suppliers\ncan, for a time, fare well\nby catering to these wants.\nBut often the pressure\nis too instantaneous, too\nunsustainable. Authorities\ncannot plan for such rapid\nrises of industry and are\ntherefore unprepared for\nany unsavoury effects that\ncan come with the boom.\nHence Mexico, cartels and\nthe avocado\u2019s potential to\ncause violent conflict at\nany given moment.\nBut before you start\nworrying that even\navocados do more harm\nthan good and before you\nstart contemplating that\nanything you like is bound\nto be causing destruction\nsomewhere along the line,\nlet me offer some hope.\nResidents of Tanc\u00edtaro, a\ncity in Michoac\u00e1n, have\ntaken matters into their\nown hands by setting\nup self-defence groups\nbacked by government\nforces. They have effectively driven the cartels\nout and for the most part\npeople live in safety, no\nthanks to any of us importing countries.\nMichoac\u00e1n therefore\nlives to fight another day.\nHipsters up and down the\nnation can breathe a sigh\nof relief that their avocado\nsmoothies and face masks\nare still bang on the\nmoney.\nIn Spanish, avocados are called ahuacates (Aztec for testicle) // Flickr/ quinnanya\n\u201cMoney needs\nto be made\nbefore our\ngoldfish brains\nturn to the\nnext exciting\nthing\u201d\nstaple for generations. It\u2019s\nknown that demand for\n\u2018designer dogs\u2019 \u2013 pugs,\ndachshunds, French\nbulldogs (or whatever\nthe new look this season\nis) \u2013 has meant barbaric\nindustrial-scale puppy\nfarming. To note a less\nextreme example, think of\nevery time a new incredible holiday destination is\ndisplayed on Facebook,\nencouraging you to tag\nyour \u2018travel buddy\u2019. You\ncan almost guarantee that\nnext year, car parks will\nbe overflowing with minibuses and someone has\nprobably thought to bring\nin a KFC.\nNow we have instant\nconnectivity, a trend can\nspread like wild fire.\n\u201cWhenever\nhardworking\npeople are\nprospering\nthere\u2019s always\na parasite\nwanting their\nslice of the\naction\u201d\nMoreover, I have\nprivacy and security\nconcerns in giving the\ngovernment and central\nbanks complete control\nover my financial assets,\na view shared by several\nexperts. In a cashless\nsociety, a government\ncan introduce negative\ninterest rates and thus\nforce the citizen to spend\nmore. This is not possible\nwith cash. Or think about\ndictatorial regimes, which\nare essentially untouchable if they have complete\ncontrol over financial\nassets. According to an\nunpublished study of the\nEuropean Central Bank\n(ECB), about 80% of\npoint-of-sale transaction\nare done with cash. The\ngeneral standpoint of\ncentral banks like the\nECB or the German Bun\u201cOther issues\ninclude giving\nmoney to\nhomeless\npeople, which\nis significantly\nreduced in\ncashless\nsocieties\u201d\nsuch as giving money to\nhomeless people, which\nare significantly reduced\nin cashless societies.\nComing back to College\u2019s arguments, the\nCollege has not provided\n\n"

Strikes are set\nto take place over 14 days\nat 61 universities in the\nUK, including Imperial.\nThe strikes will occur in\nescalating waves, with the\nfirst week seeing strikes\nfrom 22nd-23rd February\nand the second week from\n26th-28th February; there\nwill then be a week\u2019s\nbreak, before a four-day\nstrike from 5th-8th\nMarch, and finishing with\na five-day walkout from\n12th-16th March.\nThis will result in the\nloss of almost three weeks\nof tuition, estimated at\naround \u00a3675 per undergraduate student.\nThis puts us students\nin a difficult position.\nEither we stand beside\nthe striking academics,\nwho are only defending\nthemselves against an\nunjustified attack on their\npensions and their live-lihoods, losing hundreds\nof pounds worth of our\neducation, or we cross\nover and support UUK.\nI can only foresee and\nexpect solidarity with the\nlecturers.\nThis is a choice that\nstudents should not have to\nmake, and it is a choice we\ndo not have to make. We\nstudents are now treated as\nconsumers, so we should\nbe given the same rights\nas consumers: we should\nbe given a refund for each\nday of strike action.\nRail companies like\nNorthern Railway and\nSouthern Rail already\noffer refunds to commuters\nwho decide not to travel\non strike days. Airlines\nalso offer compensation\nto travellers whose flights\nare cancelled or delayed\ndue to strike action. These\nrefunds benefit both the\nconsumers and the striking\nworkers: consumers get\ntheir money back and\ntherefore strike-breaking\nby consumer pressure is\nlessened.\nRefunds focus the\nimpact of a strike squarely\non service providers\nand offer consumers the\nfreedom to stand with\nstriking workers. You\ncould argue that students\nare not normal \u2018consumers\u2019, but by examining the\ncurrent model of higher\neducation, especially the\ngovernment\u2019s Teaching\nExcellence Framework\nplans that increase\ncompetition between uni-versities, you\u2019d struggle\nto see students in any\nother way. Students are\nalready internalizing this\nfact: according to a recent\nsurvey by ComRes, about\nhalf the students in the UK\nnow view themselves as\ncustomers.\nAs scientists or science\nstudents we often see ourselves outside the realms\nof political interaction. We\noften think of ourselves\nas remote and unaffected,\nusing science as a shield.\nHowever, science is not a\nshield. It is not a unit, it\nis made of different parts\nthat proceed in radically\ndifferent ways, all shaped\nby the outside political\nworld.\nWe need to embrace\nthis outside political\nworld, and open our\neyes to the forces that are\nchanging higher education - because these forces\nwill not stop with the dismantling of our lecturers\u2019\npensions, they will gnaw\naway at the very heart of\neducation and science.\nThey will turn universities\ninto factories that exploit\nresearchers and students\nto \u201cadvance knowledge\u201d,\nno matter the human cost.\nI say we should be more\nconcerned in the support\nof people than the advancement of knowledge\nfor profit.\nI ask you to support\nthe lecturers by writing\nto registry asking for a\ntuition fee refund that\ncovers the period of the\nstrike. If universities see\nus as consumers, we need\nto act as consumers. Hurt\nthem where it hurts, their\npockets.\nThis week, Grumpy Bastard has been getting ads from states and would really like it to stop\nplease\nT\nhis week, I\u2019ve\nbeen getting\nsome wonderful adverts on\nYouTube.Nomoreadverts\nfor Muslim singles in my\narea or why Grammarly\nis the solution to all my\nwriting problems. I particularly miss being told\nthat now is the best time\nto invest in Bitcoin or\nhow I can make $10,000\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\na day with a simple trick\nthat involves a spatula.\nInstead, these bits of\ndrivel have been replaced\nwith advertisements from\nbrands that get me, like\nthe Turkish and Polish\ngovernments.\nIt\u2019s not that these governments have authoritarian streaks so wide it\u2019s as if\nthey\u2019ve let a toddler with\ncholera loose in their un-derwear, and it\u2019s not that\nthey have a fetish for rewriting history that makes\nBig Brother look like the\nonly thing he enjoys is\nlights-out eyes-closed\nmissionary; as always, the\nthing that makes me em-pathise with these brands\nis their product.\nFrom the Turks, it\u2019s\nthe invasion of Kurdish\noccupied Afrin. This is\nmy jam. It\u2019s the continued\noppression of one of the\nlargest and unfortunately\ngeographically incoherent\nethnic groups in the whole\nof the Middle East that\nhave taken a kicking from\nevery single one of the\ncountries in which they\nare resident. In Turkey\nthey\u2019re arrested, in Iraq\nthey were gassed, and in\nSyria they were massa-cred. Luckily, whoever\norganises the YouTube\nadverts is happy to ignore\nthis and ram on something\nthat would only appeal to\nrabid Ottoman fans.\nThe Polish are, of\ncourse, doing wonderful\nthings at the moment.\nI\u2019m a big fan of taking\naway freedom from the\njudiciary, but what they\nadvertised on YouTube\nwas right up my alley:\nthey have taken the\naction of denying that any\nPoles were involved in\nthe wholesale slaughter\nof Eastern European\nJewry. Finally, someone\nis approaching this topic\nwith the sensitivity of an\nartillery barrage on the\nSomme, and completely\nignoring the complex\nmoral problem that occupation and collaboration\nposed, just like the rest\nof occupied Europe! A\nwhole section of history\nthat is completely ignored,\nall for the benefit of the\nmoral scruples of a new\nblind generation.\nWhy am I getting these\nadverts, YouTube? I am\nquite frankly not interested in these petty tyrants\nattempting to justify\nthemselves in the face of\nwidespread condemnation\nfrom the West and indeed\nanyone with a brain.\nPlease remove them and\nbring back Poppy the\n\u201cHurt\nuniversities\nwhere it hurts,\ntheir pockets\u201d\nUUK and the universities that make it up are responsible for this strike. It\ndoes not fall on the UCU,\nwho are merely defending themselves.

The parts\nI use for systematic\nproblem solving take a\nbreak and instead it is\na desperate rush to find\nthe most sticker-coat-ed, cheapest and most\nappealing supplies for\nthe week ahead. It is\nimpossible, it seems, to\ntruly understand what it\ntook to create the fruits\nof modern agriculture\nand technology lined up\nalongside their identical\nsiblings. How were they\nmade? Where were they\nmade?\nThis is something\nwhich goes undiscussed\nwhen we talk about\nshopping. We talk about\nshopping very much on\na personal level \u2013 \u201cI like\nyour new trainers\u201d, or \u201cI\nfound a bloody bargain\u201d\n\u2013 but we don\u2019t discuss\nthe value of how things\nare made or the implications on a societal level.\nThis article serves as a\npersonal confession and\na challenge to all of you\nout there who also silently\nturn over similar thoughts.\nLet me set the scene.\nJust like millions of other\npeople, here I am on\nTuesday evening foraging\nalong white-painted\nshelves in an LED-dappled cornucopia of abun-dance. Items sitting above\npaper labels yell out to\nour primate brains their\nlow prices or multi-pack\noffers \u2013 and only as an\nafter-thought, mention the\nfact it may have travelled\nhalf the globe to get\nhere. The question nags\nme \u2013 what impact do I\nhave on the environment\nand the people where\nthese products are made\n\u2013 people and places with\nwhom my only interaction\nmay be my selection of\nsome exotic \u2018superfood\u2019\nor yellow-stickered ready\nmeal that are the fruits\nof their labours, and to\nwhose troubles I give little\nthought? What gives me\nthe right to make choices\nabout which things are\nmade? What gives any of\nus this ability, other than\nthe privilege of sitting at\nthe top of the planetary\nfood chain?\nThese questions are not\neasy to answer and may\ntake a backseat when in\nthe midst of a shopping\nfrenzy. It is however precisely these irrational de-cision-making processes\nwhich collectively cause\nmany of the problems we\nface as a species \u2013 from\ninequality to environmental damage.\nFor instance, when\nchoosing stuff do we\nbother to read the ingredients on the back of the\npacket? You might be\nsurprised, like me, to find\nthat your lunch has a more\nfantastic origin than you\nmight expect. Consider\nthe simplest sandwich you\ncan get in Library caf\u00e9 \u2013 a\nBLT or cheddar ploughman\u2019s. That sandwich\ncontains palm oil which\nreaches you now thanks to\nenormously sophisticated\nsupply routes spanning\nthe globe. Moreover, you\nmay ask, why are there\npacks of blueberries in\nbloody January? And\u2026\nwhen are tomatoes for\nthat mozzarella panini in\nseason exactly?\nI do not worry that\nsuch and such ingredients\nbeing in my bread means\ncompanies are conspiring\nto poison us, or that\nforeign migrants are infringing upon the plastic\nthrones of blue-blooded\nBritish blueberries in their\nseasonal absence.\nI do worry that it is\nonly in recent history that\nhighly energy-intensive\nprocesses, such as international transportation\nand manufacturing, have\nbecome intrinsic to every\npart of our lives since our\ndiscovery of fossil fuels.\nIt is not a sound plan for\nour future to increase the\nenergy intensity of the way\nwe sustain ourselves. Renewable energies simply\nwill not be able to support\nexponential growth like\nfossil fuels were able to in\nthe past century and a half.\nFormer-banker turned\nenvironmentalist Nate\nHagens remarks that our\ncontemporary economy is\npredominantly \u201ca measure\nof how fast we can burn\nthrough fossil capital and\nconvert it into immediate\nneurotransmitter responses\u201d.\nMy second concern\nis that this level of consumption is not something\nenjoyed by everyone\npartaking in our society\u2019s\nfood web. Just last week,\nOxfam published a report\nestimating that 82% of\nthe wealth generated\nworldwide last year went\nto the wealthiest 1%.\nThe poorest 50% saw no\nincrease. Is it possible our\nglobal food chain actually\ndepends on exploitation?\nThis being said, I\nbelieve with our bonanza\nof energy unlocked by\nour discovery of coal and\noil, and our intelligence,\nwe have achieved a great\ndeal, such as providing\npeople with more time,\na higher level of societal\norganisation and truly\nremarkable scientific and\ncultural achievements.\nSo what can we do to\nremarkably successful\ntool for fulfilling them.\nSecondly, we need to\nlearn habits to help us\nmake the best decisions\nwe can in the shop, just as\nwe have learnt to switch\nlights off when we leave\na room. For instance,\nreducing meat consumption is a simple way of\nhugely reducing environmental impact. The\nNew Scientist reports this\nweek that a medium-meat\ndiet of 50g-100g per day\nproduces 2600 kg of CO2\nin a year \u2013 the equivalent\nemissions of four return\nflights to Majorca. For\nmeasure, a typical ham\nsandwich bears about 40g\nof pig.\nThirdly, at the same\ntime as our environmental\nfootprint has worsened,\nwe have been equipped\nwith the tools to make\nmore informed decisions\nwhen it matters. Today,\nmany of us carry smartphones everywhere we\ngo. The smartphone\nbrought us Fruit Ninja,\nbut it could also let us\nlook up how much energy\nit takes to fly real fruit\nfrom the other side of the\nglobe and slash our real\nenvironmental footprint.\nBut while I have often\noverheard people in shops\nsay \u201cturns out it\u2019s cheaper\non Amazon\u201d, I have never\noverheard someone say\n\u201capples aren\u2019t in season\nat the moment\u201d, or \u201cturns\nout this brand has better\nworking conditions than\nthat one\u201d.\nAs individuals we\nshould use our choices\nand technology to make\nbetter, more democratic,\nmindful decisions about\nwhat we want and truly\nneed, rather than just\ntaking what is on offer.\n\u201cWe have\nmany choices\nin what we\npurchase and\nhence a power\nto decide what\nis created, by\nwhom, and by\nwhat means\u201d\nsave this? Firstly, we have\nmany choices in what\nwe purchase and hence a\npower to decide what is\ncreated, who it is created\nby, and by what means.\nMoney is a token which\ngives one a way, though\nnot the only way, to\nexpress our values \u2013 what\nwe care about. Let me be\nclear \u2013 spending more of it\nis not going to make your\nchoice more ethical. Nor is\ngoing for the things which\nare perceived by others, or\nby the claims on the label,\nto be better. However, we\ndo have needs, and one\nof our achievements as a\nspecies is to develop this\nYour cherry tomatoes might not be as harmless as you think // Flickr/patkuhhl\nFlickr/\n\n"
