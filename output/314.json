    "content": "Page 2 FELIX October 19, 1972\nTHE UNION\nHIERARCHY\nPAGE\nIan Mackenzie talks about AUTONOMY\nLast year about this time, the government, in the\nform of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, Secretary of State\nfor the Department of Education and Science, produced a\" Consultative Document\" (known as the\nGreen Paper) on the subject of Ithe financing of\nStudent Unions. It heralded probably the greatest\nstudent campaign ever.\nThe situation at EC. is that everyone is automatically a member of the Union and that the L.E.A.'s( Local Education Authorities) pay \u00a36 per student to\nthe college, who pass it on to the I.C.U. together with\nan extra \u00a32.50 per head as a sub vent ion. The amount\nreceived by Unions (Union Fee) varies widely throughout the country, largely depending on which \" sector \"\nof higher education the college belongs to, e.g., Universities get more than Teacher Training Colleges, who\nget more than Technical Colleges. If you want to see\nthe effect of this, compare the facilities of our Union\nwith those of West London College.\nPrior to the Green Paper, N.U.S. was co-opera-ting with the D.E.S. to try to remove this anomaly.\nHowever, the government seemed more concerned\nabout the L.E.A.'s displeasure at having to pay whatever Union Fee the Governing Bodies and Student\nUnions agreed upon, and the very few cases of\nUnions \" giving their money away \" to outside organisations un constitutionally or acting un constitutionally. Their proposals were thus aimed at exercising\nsome form of control over what Unions do with their\nmoney, and the amount of money that they get.\nThe main proposals were:\u2014\u2022\n(i) The abolition of automatic membership;\n(ii) Split-financing, i.e., part of existing Union\nFee would go direct to colleges for providing\nessential student services, and part would go\non the grant for joining clubs, etc.;\n(iii) Union constitutions must conform to a model constitution and have some form of\noutside control.\nThe effect of voluntary membership would be to\nmake almost impossible the representation of students'\nopinion both at a college and on a national level,\nwhile the split financing would greatly decrease the\namount of income to the Union and make the current\nrange of activities impossible. Worse still, the Union\nwould be in competition with other departments for\nits share of the total income to the colleges, and this\ncould easily cause unnecessary friction between the\nadministration and the Union. The \" small increase\nin the grant\" would probably not even be noticed\nby students, and most would be put off by the much\nhigher club membership fees required under the split\nfinancing scheme. On part (iii), one of the other\nproposals suggested by the D.E.S. was that a REGISTRAR of Student Unions, with rather\nundefined (unlimited?) powers would ratify constitutions, etc. At I.C., our Governing Body ratifies out\nconstitutional changes (this may be raised at the next\nU. G.M.). All in all, the va!st majority of students saw the\nproposals as greatly damaging the strength of Unions\nand limiting their power to \" do what they want with\na Guaranteed Income\" (AUTONOMY) (wondered\nwhen you were going to get on to that.\u2014Ed.).\nPerhaps, not surprisingly, most college authorities,\nand even L.E.A.s( though for different reasons) didn't like the proposals, and back in January, Mrs. Thatcher\ndeferred the implementation of\" any new scheme until\nOctober 1973 in order to think things over!\nAs far as we know, she's still thinking, but be\nprepared . . . it may not be long before a further set\nof proposals comes out . . . only this time it might\nnot be a relatively tame \" consultative document\" \u2014\nit might just be a White Paper!\nMARTIN'S BIT on\nelections\nElections\nAt 5 p.m. on Wednesday last when I, as Returning\nOfficer, took down the Nomination Papers, the following candidates were proposed and fully seconded:\nFloor Representative on Council:\nK.

The new smaller page\nsize is because we can't afford\na larger oriel SI And anyway, we\nare now saving space by not\nhaving, any ego trips, following severe criticisms from other\nhi-ego publications in the col-\u00a9\nleg e. And, to stress the point of our new look even more, we've\ngot a new head. But we're still here with the purpose of bring ing FELIX up to date. SCANDAL SPOT VERY ENT--ERESTTNG\nKeen FELICITY and FELIX readers will note with amazement that the\nre cc rd breaking news from Ents committee this week is that they have actually ra.de a profit and a large one - from the first two of their f \"ve \" Spring Thing\" concerts, i.e. America and Stone the Crows. Informed sources put the\nprofit figures at \u00a3180 for the Stone the Crows concert and nearer \u00a3250 for the other. Last terra, fr ll owing a motion of no confidence in Ents Committee,\nthe whole committee stood for reelection, and all except one, the publicity officer, got in again. Congrats on the profits keep it up ; !\nTHE BLUE LIGHT\nOn Tuesday evening McClooge received a friendly visit from the local fuzz, ostensibly to complain about the soot f ting sounds that regularly emanate\nfront the Union Building. However, it seamed that the visit was more c once r ned with recent mascot raids, which the boys in blue think should shortly come\nto an end. Notable was the attempt by certain Nobility of I.C. to unbolt and\ndig up a lamppost from Prince Consort Road (doubtless to save fe\u00bbr posterity) and transplant it in the Be it Quad. The gang got as far as the quad, eagerly clutching lamppost, before they were given a\" friendly warning\".\nI CAN SEA(****) YOU I On Tuesday last, the day of Piers' E.G. M.( see FELIX) , the al might Mr, Car lS*****d was seen in College Block muttering \"So there'sa Union\nMeeting is there? It's in here is it''\", whilst vaguely heading in the direction of the Press Box. Here, our scout informs us, there is a one-way glass, so that anyone in the box can see anything in the Great Hall without actually be ing seen. Suggestions that Mr.S***** d was spying would be uncharitable. UGM TODAY CANCELLED\nToday's UGM has been cancelled because, quote I.C.

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX October 19, 1972\nAPPLY IN WRITING! I by Chris Perrott\nof Curriculum Vitae\nService and W.R. Price,\nM.A. Looking for a job is a job in itself. It should be\napproached as a marketing operation with yourself as the product. In any\nmarketing operation the\nfirst step is to make the\nproduct known to the\nmarket \u2014 both that it\nexists, and what it can do.\n\u2014 in other words to ad-vert is e. Your letter of application and your Curriculum\nVitae are your self advertisement. Their purpose is\nto inform the prospective\nemployer of your existence\nand your availability for\nemployment, and to set\nforth sufficient of your\nqualities and experience to\nconvince him that he\nshould investigate you\nfurther by inviting you for\nan interview. If you are invited for an interview then\nthe first stage of your marketing operation has been\nsuccessfully completed.\nAs with any marketing\noperation you will start by\nmaking a plan of com-pa ign and budgeting for it.\nFirst, decide how much\ntime you can spend on\nyour search. If you are\nwithout employment, the\nanswer will be \"at least 8\nhours a day\". Secondly,\ndecide how much money\nyou can spend. Remember\nthat however tight your\nbudget, the expenses of\njob hunting must be given\na very high priority. They\nwill include telephone, pos-t age, stationary, printing,\nsecretarial services (unless\nyou can use your wife!),\ntravel, entertainment, and\nperhaps the expense of\nstaying away from home.\nIf you are without em-ploy ment, time is of the\nessence. Not only will you\nfind that the longer you\nare out of a job the tighter will your budget be-come, but you may also\nfind that prospective employers seem less interested in you. Several months\nwithout employment may\nbe taken, rightly or\nwrongly, to indicate that\nyou lack initiative.\nIf you are employed,\nbut looking for advance-ment, budgeting for time\nwill be one of your main\nproblems. Your search\nwill involve considerable\nreorganisation of your\nlife, especially to make\ntime for interviews, and\nmay even mean cutting\ninto your annual holiday.\nThe first time consuming job is RESEARCHING THE MARKET.\nRead regularly the advertisements. Make out a list'\nof companies to approach\ndirectly without- waiting\nfor them to advertise. Get\nyour name on the books\nof as many Employment\nagents and Management\nConsultants as you can.\nIf you decide to approach a firm, ring it up,\nfind out its precise field\nof activity and ask to be\nsent any literature pertain-The first of two articles in which Chris Perrott\nand W. Price explain the technicalities of applying for a job.\ning to its activities. Above\nall, find out the name of\nthe person who will read\nyour application, and address your letter of application to him personally.\nThe second time consuming job is APPROACHING THE MARKET. You will need\nto submit a Letter of Application together with\nyour Curriculum Vitae.\nYour Letter of\nApplication\nThis should be designed\nto advertise you and your\nsuitability for the appointment for which you are\napplying. It should contain\nsufficient information\nabout you to make the advertiser want to know\nmore. Never allow it to\nrun to more than one\npage. The detailed information should be contained in your Curriculum\nVitae, which should be\nattached to your letter.\nTry to keep your letter\nof application to three\nbasic paragraphs:\n1. Say what position\nyou are applying for and\nhow you know it is vacant,\n(i.e.\"I am applying for\nthe position of Branch\nManager which was advertised in the Daily Telegraph on September 7th\"). or\n(\"I have been advised to\nwrite to you by Mr\nwho tells me that you will\nshortly be looking for a new Branch Manager\")\nor\n(\"I am writing to you in\nthe hope that you may be\nable to help me. I am\nlooking for a position as\nBranch Manager to an established firm, and hope\nthat this opportunity may\nexist within your organ is a tion\")\n2. This is the main paragraph of your application.\nIt should be firm and to\nthe point, designed to\nprove your suitability for\nthe position by way of\nqualifications and experience, as well as demonstrating your determination and confidence in\napplying. Try to keep it to\ntwo main points.\n(i.e.\"I have been employed as Manager of several major organisations\nover a period of x years,\nand my background and\nexperience would appear\nto match your requirements exactly.. ,\")\nor\n(\"I took the opportunity\nof telephoning your office\nto determine the details of\nPORN: A Communist Plot?\nAre the very roots of our society in danger of being eaten away by yet another\n\"communist\" plot? According to Mrs. Mary\nWhitehouse, the answer is yes. Mrs. Whitehouse was speaking at a General Studies\nlecture last Tuesday entitled \"The Assault\non Freedom\". Mrs. Whitehouse, for those\nwho are not in the know, is the Secretary\nof the National Viewers' and Listeners'\nAssociation.\nShe would have us be- a supposed ability to un-li eve that pornography is d ermine our moral fibres,\nan instrument of com mun The suggestion that por-\\t infiltration, because of no graph y is a \"powerful\npolitical weapon\" was met\nwith hoots of derision\nfrom an unusually large\naudience \u2014 Mech Eng\n220 was full to capacity.\nUntil this point, Mrs.\nWhitehouse held the respect of the audience with\na well-presented speech\nwhich appeared acceptable to the main body of\nlisteners. It was only when\nconfronted with such\namazing statistics as that\n55 per cent of all rape\ncases in the United States\nof America are in some\nway a direct result of por-no graph y, and thus the\naforementioned communist plot, that her arguments appeared to possess\na false basis.\nHowever, even should\nher hypothesis be proved\ncorrect, we may all sleep\nsafely in our beds tonight.\nThe plot has, after all,\nbeen now uncovered, and\nwe are all in the secure\nand omnipresent hands\nof our guardian angel and\nGood Shepherd, Mary\nWhitehouse.\nyour requirements, and my\nexperience and qualifications appear to fit very\nwell\").\nIt is always a good idea\nto make a telephone approach as well as writing a letter, as this demonstrates\nyour initiative and deter-mi nation. Wherever possible you should find out\nthe name of the advertiser\nand address him person-ally, and when you telephone to do this always\nleave a message to say who\nhas phoned and that you\nwill be writing. The\nchances are that this message will be passed on to\nthe man concerned, and\nwhen he sees /our letter\nof application he'll say to\nhimself \"This is the fellow who went to the\ntrouble of telephoning\n. . .\" You are immediately\none up on other app li cants.\n3. The final paragraph\nshould simply state that\nyour full details are contained in your Curriculum\nVitae, which is attached,\nand that you will be available for interview at a mutually convenient time.\nYou should also state\nwhen you will be available\n\u2022to take up the appoint-ment. (This is a positive\nstatement which illustrates\nyour determination and\nconfidence).\nLetters of application\nmay be typed or hand writ ten. The important point is\nthat they should be clear,\neasy to read and imp res sive. Use good quality\nnote paper, and make sure\nthat your signature is\nlegible. (If not print it out\nunderneath). Make sure\nthat your address and\ntelephone number are\nclear.\nYour Curriculum Vitae\nA Curriculum Vitae\nshould be a clearly written\nand well kid out summary\nof your personal history\nand experience. The prospective employer, having\nhad his basic interest\naroused by your letter of\napplication, uses the Curriculum Vitae to confirm\nin his mind whether you\nare in fact the type of employee he is looking for. It\nshould be concise and to\nthe point, and contain the\nbriefest possible details of\nyour background. As long\nas your Curriculum Vitae\nindicates your suitability\nin the broadest terms, you\nwill have the opportunity\nto elaborate at the inter-view. Try and make the\nprospective employer say\nto himself \"This man\nlooks interesting, I'd like\nto know more about him\".\nNext week, we will be\ntelling you how to compose and prepare your\nCurriculum Vitae in detail.\nIt's importance warrants\na separate article.\n* The Curriculum Vitae\nService is a company operating as a specialised\nsecretarial service to employment seekers, including preparation of\nyour Curriculum Vitae\nand letters to employers.\nIt charges surprisingly\nlow prices for what appears to be an excellent\nservice. For further de-tails, write to the service\nc/o Felix... we will\npass your letters on\nwithout delay.\n\n"

But don't worry. The footsteps we're\nconcerned with are not such as will cause\nyou to search your conscience. We refer,\nas it happens, to the insurance salesman.\nHe'll be doing his level best to sell\nyou an insurance policy. No doubt, he will\ngive you many reasons why you ought to\nbuy. So many, in fact, that you may feel\nyou cannot go on another day without getting insured. But before you run for cover,\ninsurance wise, it might be as well to find\nout if you really need it. Ask yourself one\nor two questions. Or, better still, ask him.\nWe suggest the conversation might\ngo like this...\nStudent: Before we\ngo any further, may 1\nask a direct question.\nWhy should I buy in sur ance?\nSalesman: For some\ngood reasons. For one\nthing, it's cheaper when\nyou're young. Sooner or\nlater, you'll be thinking\nabout buying a house.\nInsurance now will help\nyou with that later. You\nmay have a family.\nYou'll need to protect\nthem with insurance.\nWhy not start now? Our\ncompany views the\nproblems of students\nvery seriously. We design flexible policies\nparticularly for the\nyounger man.\nStudent: Yes, I'm young. But I'm single\nand have no depend-ents. More important, i have no money. How\nmuch cheaper will it be\nto buy insurance now,\ncompared, say, to three\nyears' time, when I'm earning? Would you say\npounds\u2014or pennies?\nSalesman: Well, pen-nie s. But there are many\nother reasons for buying\nnow.\nStudent: Yes, you\nmentioned that. One of\nthe reasons was house\npurchase. How, exactly,\nwill insurance help me\nthere?\nSalesman: You can\nborrow against the policy at a future date \u2014\nthat is when you're\nready to buy a house.\nStudent: But I'd like\nto know how much I can\nborrow. Suppose I buy\nan endowment policy\nwith profits, which is\ngoing to cost me five\npounds a month. How\nmuch can I borrow on\nthat in three years'\ntime?\n. . . said the\nstudent to\nthe salesman\nSalesman: The loan value.\nStudent: How much\nis that?\nSalesman Ninetyfive per cent \u2022\u2014 sometimes even 100 per cent\nof the cash surrender\nvalue.\nStudent: Sounds great. But what will that\namount to?\nallow me to borrow\n\u00a3135 of my own money\n\u2014presumably subject to\ninterest \u2014 to help me\nbuy a house? That wouldn't even buy me\nthe front doorstep,\nwould it?\nSalesman: I merely\nsaid it would help.\nThere are other types of\npolicy. But even if we\nThis is the first of a regular series of\narticles on financial matters by DEREK\nE. CUMMINGS, an incorporated insurance broker who is known to students\nand faculty at Imperial College for his\nlectures on similar subjects over the\npast five years. In his financial page\narticles, he will expound his own forthright views on the mysterious subject of\nmoney\u2014and how to hang on to it.\nSalesman: About three-quarters of the\npremiums paid.\nStudent: Hold on a moment. Three-quarters\nof the premiums paid.\nThat's... let me see\n. . . about \u00a3135 of my\nmoney. Are you saying\nthat your company will\nstick to this endowment\npolicy, there are many\nbenefits for you. It\namounts to a long-term\ninvestment. It will be a tidy sum for you in later\nlife, or for that rainy\nday.\nStudent: Alright, let's consider that. Just how\nlong will it take your\ncompany\u2014as you say,\none of the most competitive in the land \u2014 to\ndouble the value of my\npremiums?\nSalesman: With bonuses calculated on a compound basis, you\nwill see the value of\nyour policy growing\nrapidly. According to\nmy calculations, we\ntake only 15/17 years\nto double your money.\nThats' worth thinking\nabout.\nStudent: I agree. But\nI'm also thinking about\na report by Mr. Terence\nHiggins, Secretary of\nState to the Treasury,\nwho recently stated that\nthis country is taking\nonly 8/10 years to\nHALVE the real value of\nmoney.\nSalesman: Who?\nStudent: It doesn't matter. The point is that\nif I buy a policy from\nyou to save for a rainy\nday, all I shall get is\nwet.\nSalesman: Alright,\nbut you'll agree, surely,\nthat when you are married and have a family,\nyou are going to need\ninsurance to protect\nthem?\nStudent- Yes. But I'm not married now, and to\nthe best of my belief, 1\nhave no children. In the\ncircumstances, I think\nI'd be wiser to think\nabout insurance when II do have those responsibilities. Why don't you\nleave me your card?\nSalesman: My card?\nStudent: Yes. I 'll call\nyou when I need you.\nSalesman: Oh yes .\n. . . my card.\nStudent: Look, all I'm saying is this. You're\nobviously a man who is\nwell aware of the present situation regarding\nhousing, the economy\nand so on. Don't you\nthink I'd be better employed putting whatever\nlittle money I can spare\ninto a building society?\nAfter all, with more and\nmore young people like\nmyself coming into the\nhouse buying market\nevery year, the building\nsocieties are going to be\nunder pressure, aren't they?And they are going\nto be a little more careful who they lend\nmoney to, meaning that\nthey are going to give\npriority to their own\ninvestors. And if that's true, I think I'd be foolish to start buying insurance before I need\nit. Don't you agree? I mean, really?\nThe next article in this\nseries will appear on\nNovember 6th. ELECTIONS\n. who needs them ?\nI suppose that to ail those of you who\nare seasoned salts of Imperial College, the\nforthcoming elections must seem quite as\ncommon place and necessary as a visit to the\nwater closet. Certainly, none of you seem to\nbe in a frenzy of excitement over them . . .\nwhich is hardly surprising since hardly any\nof you are standing for anything.\nYou will therefore consider it strange for me to\ntell you that I find them\nrather interesting. About\nas interesting as an anticlockwise corkscrew would be to a barman.\nWho, pray tell me,\nNEEDS all these elections\n\u2014and, more relevant still,\nwho needs people to do\nall these jobs anyway?\n(M.C. B., of course \u2014 who\ndid you think wanted\nthem?\u2014Ed.)\nI would be quite prepared to believe that there\njust might be a perfectly\nsane answer to this ques-tion. You probably think\nme a twit for not knowing\nit. You are perfectly right,\nof course. I suppose that\nI should have knocked up\nthe Rector and requested\nan explanation, or gone\nand seen M.C. B. and\nasked for an oration, or\nshould have waded through either the I.C. Archives or the Union\nGreen Blue Book (what's the difference, please?) in\norder to find out. but I didn't find I doubt if\nI'd have been any the\nwiser if I had. Come to\nthink of it, I doubt if\nmany of the other 1,700\nfresher s bothered to find\nout either.\nSo please come on,\nshake a leg in whatever\ndepartment should shake\na leg, and INFORM us\n(Sorry, they have n't elected the I.C. Union\nLeg Shaker yet \u2014 any nominations?\u2014Ed.). We\nare the masses, susceptible to whatever you put\nout for us to see, so use it.\nDon't just ask for nominations for the Presidency or whatever it is,\nfor all I know it might\njust be another lo lite name for a lavatory\nattendant (and we've got\nenough of those in our\nfamily as it is!)\u2014tell us\nabout the post and what\nthe job entails. Maybe\nthen somebody might stand to do something.\nTo get anywhere you need\nAction AND Words\n- : \u2022 says Mike Doherty, Academic Affairs Office\nNow that Freshers' Week has passed\nand most of you have settled down into\nanother academic (?) year, it seems\nappropriate that I should mention a few of\nthe more important issues concerning\nacademic affairs (wot are they?\u2014Ed.).\nWithout doubt, the\nmost important method\nof communicating with\nthe staff, at an influential level, is via the departmental staff-student\ncommittee. High-level\ntalks with the College\nadministration are necessarily important but of\nno practical use whatsoever if the results don't filter into the depart-ment s. Quite apart from\nthis, the departments\nare so independent of\nthe college administration about domestic\nmatters that decisions\nreached at college\nlevels can, in many\ncases, be completely\nignored by the depart-ment s. Of course, exactly\nthe same reasoning can\nbe applied to the stud-ents' side. Policy dec is ions made at\nU.G. M.'s and council\nmeetings are\\ of |;f 'ttl;e value unless they are\ntaken into the departments and discussed in\na departmental context.\nExperience shows that\nalthough a principle\nmay be accepted by\nmany departments,\neach department applies\nit in a different way\u2014an\nexample being the principle of continual assessment.\nIn order to have a~ well balanced cross-section of opinion, staff-student committees are\nusually made up (of\nseveral staff with varying positions) together\nwith the academic year\nreps, the department\nrep. and a representative from the Union Council. Quite clearly\nthe year reps, are the\n\" nitty gritty \" of the\nstudent representation\nand in many cases the\nsuccess of the staff-student committee depends on the enthusiasm of the year reps. If\nthe year reps are in\ncontact with their year,,\nthen the staff-student\ncommittee is a meaningful institution and not just tea and biscuits with the head of\nthe department.\nIf anybody ever feels\nstrongly (which is\ndoubtful) about a matter\nconcerning himself or\nhis department (if\nyou're the other kind read \"her\") then go\nand tell your year rep.\n\u2014make sure that your\nopinion is at least\nheard (it may be the\nonly one).

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX October 19, 1972\nEDITORIAL\nIt is Sunday afternoon. It is 5.45 pj n.I am sitting\nat a typewriter. By precedent, I am now required to\nwrite of the order of six hundred words entitled \"Edi-to rial\". But what about? There seems little point in\nwriting of the burning issue of the day (the forthcoming\npresidential election, if you were not aware), since\nthere are already six hundred or so words on the subject on the front page.\nOkay, let's write about Representation. Oh hang'\nthere are already 1100 words on that elsewhere in this\nissue. What else is happening? Nothing?\nApathy. That's a good idea. I can write lots about\nthat. No I can't,I'm too apathetic.\nYou've heard it all before. Or rather, you've read\nit in innumerable FELIX editorials about this time\nof year every year since the world and I.C. Union be-gan. The terrible thing is that things DO happen here.\nMaybe they are not of world-shattering importance, but\nevents of interest occur every day in IC alone. Apathy\nis, honestly, much less evident than is usually made out.\nThe problem is that of information. I have been\ncriticised over the last week or two for not reporting\nmany of the happenings in and around I.C.I am prepared to take part of the blame, but most of it is, I consider, unfair. So things DO go on in IC . . . but\nwho gets to know about them. Not FELIX, for one.\nFELIX will print reports on just about anything. If\nthey're printable. But we have to know about them\nfirst. If you're concerned, please tell us, so that we can\ndo something about it. It would be most unfortunate\nif, come next Spring, the same criticisms of communication within the college are levied once again. The\nmedia are now here. A weekly FELIX, more STOIC,\nEven a regular weekly CEFE . . . but where's the\ninformation to put into them?\nStudent news item of the week was obviously the\nheckling of Her Majesty the Queen at Stirling University on Friday. This despicable act will certainly\nnot further the aims of students. Their objection to\nthe astronomic expenditure for the Queen's visit was\nquite justified. All their actions did was to gain them\nthe major headline in every newspaper of any importance (with the notable exception of \"Felix\") and gang\npublic opinion against them. As they will have read in\nFriday's \"Evening Standard\" survey of the \"Men and\nWomen in the Street\", their only support now comes\nfrom 22-year-old punch card operators from Willesden.\nIt was doubtless as a result of this that they tendered\ntheir apologies on Sunday to the Queen. This will not,\nhowever, heal the wounds incurred by the British Public. It may be many years before Universities are again\nhonoured by the presence of Her Majesty and pomp\nand circumstance return to formal occasions in these\nauspicious institutions of higher education.\nREPRESENTATION\nCONFERENCE\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nSir,\u2014May I encourage\nthe Editor of Felix to\nwithhold from publication any letters not bearing the identification of\ntheir author.\nIt seems a pity that\nwhat might easily be a useful College publication\nof high standing allows itself to be used as a shield\nof anonymity by those\npeople who choose to\nwrite derisive and denigrating letters, more often\nthan not ill-informed and\nmildly libellous.\nThe refusal to publish\nsuch letters would in no\nway discourage those with\na valid point of view who\nhave the common courtesy\nto put their name to their\nopinions, while those who\nseek to sneer and disparage with the cowardly use\nof esoteric pseudonyms\nwould be forced to seek\nelsewhere a platform for\ntheir dull wit.\nI am dear sir yours\nfaithfully,\nDAVID ROSSELL\nLinstead Hall,\nPrince's Gardens,\nLondon SW7 1LU Sir,\u2014With reference to\nthe letter headed \"Let us\npray\" which appeared in\nthe current edition of\n\"Felix\".\nI wish to point out that\nthe implication that members of the Linstead Hall\nBar Committee are given\n\"unconditional ^-admit-t ance\" for services to the\nBar is false. It is at best\ninsulting, and at worst\nlibellous, to the Bar, Hall\nand re-selection committees of 1971-2. and to the\nWarden of the Hall, for it\nimplies that they were all\ncorrupt.\nFor my own case, for\nyour information, my extra years in Hall were\narranged by Dr. Grey of\nthe health centre. There is\nonly one other person on\nmy committee who is in\nHall for a third year, and\nthat is also on the recommendation of Dr. Grey.\nI am saddened by the\nfact that the Editor of the\nnewspaper \"Felix\" should\nallow members of his\neditorial staff to produce\nsuch wild accusations\nwithout first ascertaining\nthe facts of the matter.\nTrusting that you will\ntake such action as is\nnecessary, I remain Sir,\nYours faithfully,\nA.R. TREASURE\nChairman, Linstead Hall\nBar Committee.\nSir,\u2014I am amazed, flab-berg as ted, outraged, infuriated, astounded, and\nsomewhat put out.\nReading \"Felix\" today\nI come across an article\nwhich I was pleased to\nthink was a precedent in\nthe turgid history of your\ndistinctly silly little paper.\nHere was an article that\nmade sense. Sentences\nwith verbs constructed into lucid paragraphs\nformed an oasis, a veritable Eden in the barren\ndesert of Felix's literary\nworth.\nPerhaps, I thought, here\nwe were witnessing the\nbeginning of Felix's slow\ncrawl from the primeval\nswamps of prehistoric\njournalism.\nBut wait, the article is\nfamiliar. Was there not\nsomething similar in\nGuildsheet on Monday?\nIn fact was there not\nsomething EXACTLY the\nsame in Guildsheet? Sir,\nthere was!\nI am amazed, flabbergasted, outraged, infuriated (save us, Ed.), astounded and somewhat put\nout.\n\"Chris\",\nEditor, \"Guildsheet\".\nEditor's Comment: Presumably your amazement,\nflabbergast ment, outrage,\nin furia tion, astonishment\nand somewhat put-out ability were caused by discovering that you had\nwritten something sufficiently printable to publish\nin this fine journal. Thank\nyou for your kind comments about FELIX. Remind me to write a letter\nto Guildsheet some day.\nBy the way, if you had\nread the credits box on\nthe back page, you would\nhave found that Guildsheet\nhad actually been credited\nwith the article I Dear Sir,\u2014It has come\nto my notice that my\nname has 'been advanced\nas a candidate in the\nforthcoming Presidential\nelection. I should like to\nmake it clear that I am\nnot, and never have been,\na candidate in the aforesaid election. I had no\nknowledge of said nomination which I believe was\nperpetrated in jest by a person or persons un-known. I regret that I did\nnot discover the hoax until \u2022 last Friday morning\neven although my name\nhad been on the papers\nfor some time.\nFinally, I feel it necessary to apologise for unwittingly misleading the\nmembers of I.C.U., especially anyone who may in\nall innocence have seconded by nomination.\nYours,\nJOHN A.D. HARDING\n(cont. from Page 1)\nrepresentation on staff /\nstudent committees. He\nargued that he considered\nthis now inadequate, and\nhoped as a result of this\nconference a debate would\nbe held at Margate conference in late November\nwhich would alter NUS\npolicy. \"Representation\"\noften ended up as \"consul-t ation\", he pointed out,\nand although this was a step it was by no means\nenough. Higher Education\ninstitutions are oligarch ian heir archies, he said, and\nthis must be changed.\nMost of the questions\ncame from and were concerned with universities\nand poly s where there is\nalways a degree of representation and their\nUnions want more. Mike\nBaxter, formely of the\nNUS Exec, brought the\nconference back to earth\nwith an impassioned\nspeech, reminding delegates that in the vast majority of small colleges there\nis no representation at all,\nand the Principal tends in\nthese cases to be completely dictatorial. He\npointed out that many of\nthe students in FE colleges\nand Technical Colleges are\ntrades unionists, and that\nlarge numbers of the\ngovernors of these colleges\nare also TU people. He\nsaid that the TU governors\nshould be made to care\nmore about their fellow-unionist students.\nIn the second session,\ndiscussion groups were\nformed from the various\nfactions represented, i.e. Universities, Polys, Colleges of Education, FE Colleges and minority\ngroup colleges (e.g. Art\ncolleges). Views and experiences were exchanged\nby delegates under a discussion leader.\nThe discussion leader\nfor the Universities sector,\nJim Hancock, the President of The University of\nManchester Union, produced an excellent paper\ndetailing a review of student representation since\n1968. Very little was raised\nby any of the speakers at\nthe conference that did not\nappear on this brief but\nvery comprehensive do cu ment. It pointed out the\npitfalls of representation,\nsuch as the standing committees with no student\nrepresentation that tend to\nget set up to take the real\ndecisions when students\nare put on to a major\ncommittee, and the fact\nthat students sitting on\ncommittees tend to become\nregarded as individuals\nnot as representatives of\nthe student body as a whole. Many other points\nwere raised, and an annotated version of the\npaper together with a brief\nsurvey of representation in\nImperial College will be\npublished in the next issue\nof FELIX.\nAt the final plenary ses-sion, the conference was\naddressed by Digby Jacks,\npresident of the NUS. H \u00a9\noutlined seven major problems in dealing with representation :\n1. Students are almost\nalways outnumbered on\ncommittees.\n2. Administrations consider that students are on\ncommittees as individuals.\n3. Student unions have\nfound that, two or three\nyears after getting on to\nthem, they are on the\nwrong committees.\n4. Student representatives often have inferior\nstatus to other members of\nthe committee.\n5. Much of the matters\ndiscussed are \"confidential\" and not open to discussion amongst students.\n6. Students need to be\nmore professional and\nbetter organised if they\nare to be on committees.\n7. There are often reserved areas of business\nwhich students are not\neven allowed to observe\nthe discussion of.\nDigby said that student\nrepresentation is not an\nend in itself. It is about\ndemocracy, and representatives must be both man-da table by Union General\nMeetings and accountable\nto them. The fight for\nrepresentation, he holds, is\none of the greatest battles\nthat the NUS has to fight,\nand one of the most important ways of democrat ising higher education.\n\n"

    "content": "19th October, IS 72 FREES ISSUE No. 314\nTHE TWENTY-FOURTH IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\nCOMMEMORATION BALL Thursday, 26th October, 1972\nTickets, \u00a34.50 double, from Union Office\nbefore 18th October, 1972\nWOULD YOU BUY A USED CAR FROM THESE MEN?\nor rather, would\nyou vote for them?\nWhat do you think the President of Imperial\nCollege Union does? \"Who's he? \" \"A good\nquestion\" \"We . . . ell, what's the union? \" are\nthe usual replies.\nThis is made even more relevant by the j imminent elections which are due on 23rd*24 th October. The theory and reality differ'\nfrom year to year making any positive definition difficult, but here goes.\nThe President is the\nconstitutional head of the\nUnion and as such is on\nmost of the sub-committees\nin existence, including the\nBoard of Governors, where\nhe is assumed to speak for\nthe students. Traditionally\nhe is considered to be the\nmost politically minded of\nthe Union officials and is\ntherefore responsible for\nintroducing external politics into the student's diet.\nAs the constitution\nstands he is, however sur-p rise, surprise) accountable to the students in the\nUnion. He is obliged to\nfollow the wishes of any\nUnion meeting and if he\nappears not to be doing so,\nhis resignation can be de-mande d. The process of voting\none's rights away is inherent in a stable democracy\nand I.C.U. is no ex c ep tion. This means, there-fore, that the job is much\nmore important than is\nexplicitly stated. The order\nof discussion and the subjects brought up at a Union meeting invariably\noriginate from the Union\nExecutive of which Mister\nPresident is the chairman.\nOf course, this need not\nbe the case, but it needs\na good memory to remember the last time a \"non Exec, originated\nmotion\" was passed at a meeting.\nIf the Executive is sufficiently trustworthy then\neverything runs smoothly,\nwith the majority taking\nthe minimum amount of\neffort necessary. Therefore, the election of the\nPresident determines how\nlittle you have to do during the coining year.\nNow, if you are new to\nthe college you might be\nwondering why we are\nhaving any elections at all\nthis term. This has been\nexplained once or twice\nbefore, but a potted version is forthcoming any-way.\nThe original President,\nChris Sheppard, duly\nelected last term, resigned\nover \"an issue of principle\", leaving a slightly\nchaotic mess. Ian Mackenzie was appointed as acting President until elections could be held.\nTwo candidates are\nstanding for the post, these\nbeing Rob Armitage and\nAdrian Smith. Rob Armitage can be loosely classed\nas belonging to the Union\nEstablishment. Last year\nhe performed as Rag\nChairman and is now External Affairs Officer.\nHis opponent Adrian\nSmith stood at the previous\nelection and tried hard,\nthough without much success. Although it was not\ngenerally known at the\ntime he was, and still is,\na member of Socialist\nsociety, who have a reputation for doggedness.\nUnfortunately, this determination and conviction is hard to reconcile with the idea that the\nPresident can be told what\nto do. Just as an apolitical President does very\nlittle, an actively radical\none does too much! The\nhope always is that he\ndoes not have too many\npolitical convictions but\nenough to cause some in-te rest. Remember that you are\nresponsible for the choice\nof the next President. You\ncan either indirectly affect\nthe result by not voting or\nmake the effort, just this\nonce. If the poll is less\nthan 25 per cent of the\nstudent membership a reelection must be held, and\nnothing is more boring.\nUnder the present system\nit is possible to register an\nabstention and if these result in gaining half the\npoll, the nominations are\nopened for another ten\ndays. (See Union green\nBlue Book).\nBoth candidates would\nmake good Presidents, but\nin very different ways. If\nyou feel that revolutionary\nchange is due and you are\nwilling to support your\nchoice of candidate at\nUnion meetings, then vote\nfor Adrian Smith. If you\naccept the system as it\nstands, but like conscientious leadership, then vote\nfor Rod Armitage.\nThe choice is yours!\nREPRESENTATION\nSCANDALS\nREVEALED\n\"Student representation on the committees\nand councils that make most of the decisions\nrelating to higher education is insufficient and\nmust be increased so as to give students equal\nsay\" was the message of the one-day NUB\nconference on Representation held at Birkbeck College London on Saturday.\nThe conference opened\nwith a plenary session attended by all of the hundred or so delegates from\nUniversities, Polytechnics\nand all other kinds of institutions of higher education around the country.\nThe conference was addressed by Professor John\nGriffith, the Chairman of\nthe Council of Academic\nFreedom and Democracy,\nRichard Briginshaw, the\nGeneral Secretary of\nNATSOP, a printing\nUnion, and David Wynn of\nthe NUS Executive.\nProfessor Griffith recounted his personal experiences as \"Counsel for\nthe defence\" in numerous\ndisciplinary cases in Universities. Towards the end\nof his speech, he began to\nrecount his experiences of\nand. recommendations on\nRepresentation. He, in\ncommon with later\nspeakers, stressed the importance of adopting the\ncorrect tactics if students\nare to go in for representation. The other members\nof the committees would be\nprofessional bureaucrats,\nand unless the students sitting on the committees\nwere equally professional\nand did adequate back-up\nwork prior to the meeting\nit would be useless their\nattending. He pointed out\nthat the cards were\nstacked against students\nanyway.\nRichard Briginshaw\nwas meant to be speaking\nabout \"Democracy in Industry\" and how it related\nto student problems, but\nconcentrated on the point\nthat Trades Unions were\nvery much dependent upon\nand answerable to the law,\nwhereas Student Unions\nare not. He made no reference to representation\nuntil the end of his speech,\nand then uttered only\nguarded \"solidarity with\nthe students\" titbits. One\nwas left doubting even\nmore than ever before\nwhether the Trades Unions\nhad any sympathy whatever with students and\ntheir cause. Perhaps the\nonly point he made on the\nsubject of representation\nwas that TU representatives on management\ncommittees in industry\nhave greater permanence\nthan student reps and thus\ntend to get further in the\nlong run.\nDavid Wynn for the\nNUS Executive elaborated\non the history of representation of students in\nBritain. Demands by students for representation\nhad been made as early\nas 1820 in Scotland, and\nthe 1920's and 30's are\nlittered with examples of\nsuch demands from all\nround the country. The\nNUS passed a resolution\non the subject in 1940 that\nis hardly dissimilar from\nthose passed since the late\nsixties. He explained that\nNUS policy at the moment\nis to campaign for one-third staff, one-third student and one-third outside\ninterests representation on\ngoverning bodies and similar committees and 50/50\n(continued on page 4)\n\n"

They\nwere Dave Steel, aged 24, who completed his degree\nin Electrical Engineering last year, and Rog Scull,\nalso aged 24.\nDave was an active member of the College Mountaineering Club for several years, a rock climber of\nexceptional ability, who had several notable first and\nearly ascents to his name, especially in the Avon\nGorge area; he was also an experienced mountaineer\nwith several successful Alpine seasons behind him.\nRog was not a member of the college, but had\nbeen a close friend and usual climbing partner of\nDave's for many years, and was invited to take part\nin the expedition for his ability and experience as a mountaineer.\nClog gies?

Its plans were to spend some\nsix weeks climbing in the Caucasus mountains during\nJuly and August, but after a short time in Russia, it\nwas realised that the local restrictions and controls\nplaced upon the party in the mountains would prevent\nthe-group from achieving any significant climbs what-so ever. After two weeks, the members of the expedition\ndecided to leave Russia and travel to the French Alps.\nThe group had been in Chamonix for about ten days\nwhen the tragedy occurred.\nOn Saturday, 29th July,\nGraham Groarke and\nKeith Skelton left Chamonix for the Argentierre\nHut about five miles up\nthe valley from Chamonix\nThey planned to do two\nclimbs from the hut, both\npopular and well frequented routes. The first on the\nSunday was to be a route\nknown as the ENE buttress and NE slope of Les\nCourtes, The second which\nthey intended to climb on\nMonday was to have been\na. traverse of Le Tour Noir\nThey were expected back\nat camp in Chamonix on\nMonday evening.\nThey did not return on\nMonday evening, but\nthose left in camp were\nnot unduly worried by\ntheir non-appearance The\nweather had become\ncloudy during the after-noon, and it was assumed\nthey were spending another night in the hut and\nwould come down the following morning.\nThe alarm was raised at\n2 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon (1st August) when\nthey had not arrived. The\nspecial high mountain\nbranch of the police were\nnotified. They telephoned\nthe warden of the Argentierre hut, who said that\nGroarke and Skelton had\nleft at 2 a.m. on Sunday\nmorning to climb Les\nCourtes (3,800 m) and had\nnot returned to the hut.\nThe warden has assumed\nthey were going on down\nthe other side of the mountain to a different hut, the\nCouvercle, after completing their climb. He said\nthat a French party had\npassed them about half\nway up the climb and reported that the two Englishmen were going well,\nif a little slowly. The\nFrench party who had not\nseen them again after passing them completed the\nclimb and returned to the\nArgentierre Hut.\nThe Warden of the Cou.\nver cle Hut was then tele-phoned, and said that he\nhad seen no sign of the\npair. Both Wardens reported their areas in heavy\nmist.\nThe police said that\nthey would send their helicopter to search as soon\nas the mist cleared up a little.\nThe helicopter went up\nat first light on Wednesday morning. The bodies\nof Graham and Keith\nwere found almost immediately at the foot of the\nENE buttress of Les\nCourtes, and were brought\ndown to Chamonix. It\nwas judged that the pair\nhad fallen a long way,\npossibly from near the top\nof the climb which was\n1,800 feet from start to\nfinish. There was no obvious reason as to the\ncause of the accident.\nBoth Keith and Graham\nwere experienced climbers\nand the route was well\nwithin their capabilities. It\nis felt that the most likely\nexplanation of the cause\nof the accident is that the\npair had taken an unduly\nlong time on the early rock\nsection of the climb and\nfound themselves on the\nupper snow field in the late\nafternoon when the snow\nwas soft and unstable. It\nis almost impossible to belay or perform an ice axe\narrest in soft wet snow.\nThey would by then have\nbeen quite tired and one\nslip would have been enough to pull both men\nfrom the face.\nWhatever happened, the\nloss of two good friends\nwas a severe blow to the\nexpedition and the Mountaineering Club.\n\n"

This is your roving reporter ALJ\nbringing you the up-to-date match reports from IC\nff lug by Football Club M XV.\nThe 1st XV began the front of the posts kicked\nseason in fine style by defeating arch rivals UC on\ntheir own ground by 40-3\nWednesday, 11th Ocon\nto be r.UC won the toss,\nand elected to play with a strong wind in the first half\nThis who ever was to no\navail because from the\nkick off IC were immediately on the attack.\nHowever, with the aid of\nthe wind UC managed, on\nseveral occasions, when IC\nlooked like scoring, to\ndrive the IC back with\nlong kicks. It was from\none of these sorties into\nthe UC 25 that IC scored\ntheir first of seven tries.\nFrom a superbly won\nru cke d ball near the posts,\nFlanagan made the initial\nbreak for the ball to travel\nout along the three quart ers and McDonough\ntouched down in the corner The conversion failed.\nUC briefly came back into\nthe game with a penalty in\nfront of the posts when an\nunknown IC outside half\ninfringed. Their success\nwas short lived however\nwhen Flanagan again\nmade the initial break to\nsend Jim (thank god for\nthe new law) Hunt over in\nthe corner. A penalty in\nby Rimmer completed the\nscoring in the first half and\nIC turned round 11-3 up.\nIC now had the wind in\nthe 2nd half, and it even\nproved to be quite an ad-vantage. From a position\ndeep inside the VC the\nball came over to James,\nwho dropped a goal which\ndid NOT go over off the\npost. This opening'score in\nthe second half proved to\nbe the basis of an avalanche of points, five more\ntries being scored in the\n2nd half by IC. The best\nof the day was a combined handling movement\nbetween backs and forwards and ended up with\nMatthews (last as usual)\ngoing over wide out.\nA superb start to the\nseason then, with many\nUC players close to tears\nat the end having been run\noff their feet by a rampant\n(pardon!) IC pack. UC had no answer even after\nOssie had left the field\nmidway through the second half.\nTeam: D. Rimmer, J. McDonough, R. Stern, T. Bradbury, J. Hunt, A. James, C. Flanagan, B. Bradley, P.

Although\nattended by both the Union President and Seeretary(!)\nthe talk failed to attract many other people. The\nreason for this may very well have been that the\nmissing thousands expected a treatise on \"How Not\nto Get Busted for Drugs and Other Offences Not Normally Associated With The Average Straight Student\".\nIn fact it was nothing of the kind, to my immeasurable\ndisappointment\u2014oh what a giveaway !\nHe opened the lecture of the talk was virtually\nby informing us that of\n70 queries he had received in the year ending\nJune, 9 were concerned\nwith goods and services,\n21 were motoring of fen ces, 15 were miscellaneous, which ranged from\nnaturalization problems to\none concerned with student demonstrations \u2014 I wonder who? The remaining 25 were to do with\n\"Landlord and Tenant\"\nand this was I suppose a good enough reason for\nthe greater part of the\ntalk being taken up with\nthis subject. Indeed, it\nmight well have attracted\na few more people had it\nbeen titled \"Problems\nwith Landlords\".\nUnfortunately this part\na recital of facts which\ncan be found in the excellent \"Alternative London\" although he did\nemphasize several times\nthat people in lodgings or\nin a flat belonging or rented singly by another student can be kicked out at\nany time without four\nweeks notice or a court\norder. Then there was the\nusual jibe about Accommodation Bureaux being\nparasites and how it was\nillegal for them to charge\ntenants, and how you can\nget your deposit back by\nnot paying the last month's rent, and other tips most\nof us had heard before.\nMr. Gregory then\ncee ded to motoring\npro-and\nadmitted that a 'palm-tree justice\" prevails in\nthat even when vo u think\nyou're innocent it's cheaper to plead guilty, \"act\nsweet\" and get off with a five quid fine than to lash\nout 50 guineas hiring a barrister to prove that\nyou're in the right, a situation which seems to put\nmotorists at the mercy of\nthe police (and barristers).\nFor more serious cases the\nInsurance Company will\nprobably pay for your defence as they will be paying your damages if you're\nfound guilty. (The Union\nSecretary was seen to\nlaugh at this point). He\nalso raised the problems\nof losing the hallowed \"no\nclaims bonus\".\nOver the problems of\nCriminal Proceedings and\nlegal aid \"Alternative\nLondon\" was again quoted extensively and 1\nwould advise those people\nwho regret missing the\ntalk to consult that worthy\ntome. I found the talk\nrather disappointing.\nFeeling\nLiterary ?\nl.2.3.

It is a collection\nof short stories in the narrative. This is the type\nof book that is probably a little difficult to read\ninitially but with such a variety of stories and\nstyles that it is possible to come back to the\nbook time and time again, in different moods\nand with varied demands. It is difficult to know\nwhere to start in trying to describe to you what\nto expect, since most of the stories are truly\nexcellent. In particular Leonard Cohen's contribution deserves mentioning. His story, ' A i ong letter from F' is written in his typical earthy,\nJewish-Canadian style. The description of his\nafternoon with 'F' in a hotel bedroom leaves one\ntense and frustrated . . .\n'We both leapt for the vibrator at the same\ninstant. Her fluids made her slippery. For a second in our struggle, I wished we were making\nlove, for all her nozzles were stiff and fragrant.\nI grabbed her around the waist; before I knew it\nher bum popped out of my bear hug like a wet\nwatermelon seed, her thighs went by like a missed train, and there I was with empty lubricated arms, rose squashed against the expensive\nmahogany floor'.\nStory contrasts with story; some frightening,\nothers exciting while LeRoi Jones in 'Answers in\nProgress' even uses the layout of the print in\nhis story to enhance it. One has a feeling that\nas you read through any particular story that the\nwriter is right there in the room performing the\nvery actions that he describes to you from the\npages of his book. The actions seem very vivid\nand very, very real. Smells and sounds surround\nyou\u2014in Franz Kafka's' A Country Doctor', the\nintense fear as the doctor rides out into a blizzard from a deserted country village to answer\nthe urgent call of one of his patients is very\nstrongly felt by the reader. Perhaps this is it,\nthis is what these writers have attempted to\nproduce, a feeling of involvement and real is a tion. If it is, then they have succeeded in their\ntask.\nThis book is a brilliant vision into the minds\nof many good writers. Highly recommended.\nDick\nHeckstallSmith\nand\nSunshine i On Saturday night a somewhat small audience were treated to a presentation of Dick\nHeckstall-Smith's first\nsolo album by a band he\nhas gathered for live\nwork. This band features Jim Litherland on\nguitar, ex of Colosseum\nand Mogul Thrash along\nwith the latter's rhythm\nsection John Dentith\nand Bill Smith. Dave\nRose completes the lineup on keyboards. All\nare accomplished musicians but the vocals\nwere rather disappointing apart from Litherland whose distinctive\nvoice was featured on\nthe last two numbers\n\"Same Old Thing\" and\n\"The Pirate's Dream\".\nThe band opened with\n\"Moses in the Bullrushhoursus\" a number reminiscent of the collaborations that Pete Brown\nhas had with Colosseum.\nFollowing \"What the\nMorning Was After\"\nthey played \"Crabs\" &\n\"Future Song\" featuring\nexcellent solos by Rose\nand Dentith on wah-wah\nelectric piano, and\ndrums respectively. Then\ncame \"Same 0 Id Thing\", a slow number\nwith a blues feel which\nwasn't restricted to the\nusual twelve or eight\nbar form. Litherland's solo in this showed how\nhis playing has improved\nsince the days of \"Val-en tyne Suite\". The number also included some\nnice sax by Dick, e spec i( continued on p.3) Reviews\nICS THE HEIST\n(Richard Brooks)\nWarren Beatty, Goldie Hawn, Gert Frobe\n120 mins.\nTHE GODFATHER\n(F.F. Coppola)\nMarlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Cain\n175 mins.\n(ABC 1, Empire, Paramount,\nUniversal).\nVariety is the spice of\nlife, we say with a smile,\nbut the smile soon fades\nwhen we discover that\nthe variety is from good\nto bad. First the bad\nnews\u2014THE HEIST. I will try to be polite.\nThe acting is not exceptional\u2014either way.\nHow Goldie Hawn has\nearned the reputation of\na natural actress must\nremain the well guarded\nsecret of Goldie Hawn\nand even the fine performance by Gert Frobe\nas the overweight, over-anxious, overzealous\nbank manager cannot\npull the film through.\nWarren Beatty is in an\neasy role\u2014good guy\n(but bad really although\nwe all love the little dar-ling), who is security\nconsultant to Herr Jessel's bank in Hamburg.\nHe sets up an emerge n cy, gets himself locked\nin the strong room, all\naccording to plan, and\nremoves large quantities\nof cash from the deposit\nboxes of narcotics smug-gl ers. When he is freed\nhe is a hero until the\nsmugglers come to get\ntheir money. They can't go to the police but nor\ncan he so they chase\nhim, etc., etc., etc.\nThe only good line\nof the film (I can't even\nbe nice about the script)\nis when Goldie Hawn,\nthrough the gasps and\npants of delight at seeing so many million dollars enquires whether\nthere is a connection\nbetween crime and sex\n\u2014-very subtle.\nThe photography is\nstandard in line with\nlighting and special ef-fec ts. It seems amazing\nthat anyone should make\na film about a bank robbery as though it was an\noriginal idea. Stay away.\nIt is difficult not to\noverreact to a film like\nthe Heist when seeing\nthe next cellulose pro-duct ion, but a film like\n\"The Godfather\" does\nseem to warrant a great\nmany superlatives.\nIt has been said that\nthe story includes the\nlife of Frank Sinatra and\nit is fact that the original\nlead choice was scared\nof playing the part; I refrain from comment.\nThe story is about the\nMafia as it was in New\nYork post W.W. II. Five\nfamilies are involved,\nmostly it seems from\nSicily and the film follows events from one\nfamily's viewpoint. It is\nall too easy to strongly\nidentity with the Corlsone family and to sym-pathis e. Even their violence\none excuses (or at least\nit doesn't register that\nthe violence is of their\ndoing). It made me sad\nthat there has to be a good guy in any tale,\nand the film was made\nall the more powerful\nwhen the last good guy\nwas turned sour. The\nmost moving, the most\nsickening moment in the\nfilm is not when a man\nwakes up with his\nhorse's head in his bed\nbut when a single word\nis uttered a single den-i al. Marion Brando is\ntruly superb and brilliantly supported. The\nGodfather is a film of\npower, and a powerful\nfilm.\n\n"
