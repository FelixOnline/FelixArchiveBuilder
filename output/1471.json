Halloween thriller The Insti2ute\nis no exception to the trend, being poles\napart from your West End night out in\nboth setting and, sadly, in substance.\nAs an audience, we are taken on a\npromenade tour of a defunct genetic\nresearch facility, the Avernus Institute,\nrecently the site of a \u201ctragedy\u201d - a reference to last year\u2019s prequel. Now acquired by the Coalition Government as\npart of its campaign to rebuild broken\nBritain, the delightfully servile civil\nservant James (the superb David Reed)\nand his hapless, blue-rosette-wearing\nMinister Hector (capably played by\nPaul Foxcroft) invite us to inspect the\ninstitute firsthand. Swiftly however the\nscene shifts from satirical Government\npublicity event to a hair-raising bid to\nescape the laboratory that forces us to\nconfront the walking, groaning mysteries that abound in its corridors. Brilliant use is made of its semi-industrial\nsurrounds, easing the audience\u2019s near\ntotal immersion in the warped world of\nThe Insti2ute. Had I not failed in my attempts to pick up an Evening Standard, I\nmight\u2019ve missed the show entirely, such\nwas the subtlety of the cheap-suited\nlackey entering the foyer and calling all\nthose there for \u2018the tour of the Institute.\u2019\nSadly such finesse was not constant\nthroughout the performance: whilst the\nshow had some ingenious moments (the\nTory MP taking time out to check the\nlegality of everyone\u2019s presence in the\ncountry springs to mind) elsewhere the\nperformance seemed at times wooden, a\nfault of the script or the acting, it\u2019s hard\nto tell.\nWhilst I don\u2019t want to get bogged\nWill Prince\nAs one of the film editors of this beloved rag, it\u2019s a\ntad embarrassing that I haven\u2019t seen the film version of this infinitely re-readable and mind-blow-ingly touching tour-de-force of mid 20th century\nAmerican literature. British librarians voted To Kill\na Mockingbird as the top book you should read in\nyour lifetime. Having worked in the mighty Maidenhead public library in my teenage years, I shall in\n400 words or less attempt to explain why my fellow\ncomfortably shoed and perennially be-cardiganed\nbrethren feel this way.\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nTake some time out from ghouls;\nMatt Allinson really loves this book\nand you will too, we promise.\nTo Kill a\nMockingbirdby\nHarper Lee\nWhich book deserves to be read next week? Tell us\nwhy in 300 to 400 words and send them to\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNow, let me make one thing clear \u2013 I\ndon\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 horror. As in, it doesn\u2019t work\non me. Those twin girls in The Shining?\nWhatever. The wild-eyed clairvoyant in\nDon\u2019t Look Now? I encounter scarier\nreligious nutcases every morning outside Brixton Tube. Ringu? Boringu,\nmore like. You get the picture. All brilliantly imaginative entertainment, of\ncourse, but collectively about as scary\nas a cheddar ploughmans. This, coupled\nwith the well-known fact that anyone\nwho believes in ghosts is a gaspingly\nincredulous dumbo of the highest order,\nmeant that I was slightly disdainful of\nthe warnings accompanying the posters for Ghost Stories: \u201c\u2026CONTAINS\nMOMENTS OF EXTREME SHOCK\nAND TENSION\u2026 WE STRONGLY\nADVISE THOSE OF A NERVOUS\nDISPOSITION TO THINK VERY SEBone-chilling\nWest End Ghost\nStories\nEccentric drama horrifies in Islington\nJack Jelfs\n\u201cI was driven by a\ngenuine, tingling\nsense of terror\u201d\n\u2018Til Sunday at The Pleasance\nTheatre, Islington. \u00a315\nSet in depression era Alabama; this first person\naccount of 6 year old Scout Finch centres around\nthe major events of the small town in which she\nlives with her brother, widowed father and maid.\nThroughout the book, Scout\u2019s candid observations\nof her surroundings combined with a precocious\nbut endearing child\u2019s interpretation of events build\na complete but unforced picture of the town, its\nresidents, and their interactions with each other.\nThe believable and amusing scenes of childish antics build within the reader a connection with their\nown memories of childhood and the connotations\nof trust and truth that come with them. As a result,\nwhen the story passes through its darker or more\nmenacing passages, for example the night before\nthe Tom Robinson court case and Scout\u2019s own response once the Verdict is given, the reader sym-pathises immediately and unreservedly with scout,\nmaking the novel incredibly emotionally engaging.\nThe book\u2019s other strength is its characters. It has\nbeen said that no real-world lawyer has done as\nmuch for the reputation of the legal profession as\nAtticus Finch, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. The bastion of truth, honesty and diligence in his daughter\u2019s\neyes, Atticus\u2019 reputation is cemented in the readers\nmind by the occasionally begrudged but as near as\nuniversal respect from the rest of the town. While\ndegrees of his character are hidden from the reader\nby the perspective of the narrator, it is easy to build\na complete picture of the man from what can be\ngleaned. The same can be said of almost all the\nmain characters, with the only possible exception\nbeing Aunt Alexandra, whom I find a bit underdevel-oped. Faint criticism indeed for a book that, within\nits commuter friendly size and font will constantly\nand bountifully re-reward you each time you visit. So\nlisten to your librarian, and borrow this book.\ndown in debating what\u2019s theatre and\nwhat isn\u2019t, it was evident that The Insti2ute is sailing close to the wind. As a\nplay, the plot seriously lacks depth, but\nas an intensely interactive and involved\nhouse of horrors, it fits the bill perfectly.\nNever did I find myself distracted and\nthe only time I wondered how much time\nthere was left I was driven by a genuine,\ntingling sense of terror. A little suspension of disbelief is necessary \u2013 the props\nand set still retaining an air of fringe \u2013\nbut the resultant fruits are plentiful.\nAt a fast-paced forty-five minutes,\nthe show is a little on the short side\nbut the maxim of quality over quantity\nclearly reigned supreme in the minds\nof David Puckridge, Dave Scullion and\nBrendan Dodds. The latter\u2019s involvement in \u2018Pappy\u2019s Fun Club\u2019 suggested\ngreat things, the show being described\nby a friend as the funniest thing he\u2019d\never seen. And whilst I wouldn\u2019t hurry\nto beckon George A. Romero over the\npond for a viewing, it certainly makes\nfor a satisfying night out, if more in gore\nthan in profound thought. I don\u2019t want\nto give too much away, but before The\nInsti2ute I had never been in a situation\nso eerily (and fantastically) reminiscent\nof the tunnel scene in 28 Days Later; just\nsubstitute Cillian Murphy and that girl\nfor me and a bunch of North London\n20-somethings. It makes a highlight of\nthe show that nearly singularly justifies\nthe admission price.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 29 October 2010\n10\nNo matter how frustrated I get from watching science television shows I will always watch them in\nthe hope that they manage to explain an interesting concept in an entertaining and accurate way.\nOften, I\u2019m rewarded, but sometimes I find myself\nscreaming at the TV. Unfortunately, with Horizon\u2019s\n\u2018What Happened Before the Big Bang?\u2019 (BBC Two,\n11/10/10) it was the latter.\nThe program took us through a number of different\ntheories about what might have happened before\nthe Big Bang, but there were far too many to really\nstimulate any afterthought about their consequenc-es. One described an eternally rebounding universe\nwhereas another said that since time didn\u2019t exist\nbefore the Big Bang it was rather a moot point.\nSurprisingly, the only shot of the public face of\ntheoretical physics Stephen Hawking was of him sat\nat the back of a lecture theatre, perhaps pondering\nnot what happened before the Big Bang, but what\nwas happening to the sales of his new book. However, Hawking\u2019s pal Roger Penrose was featured in\ngreater depth as was his theory, the most interesting if not the most realistic of the night: something\nabout time ceasing at the end of the universe as we\nknow it being the catalyst for a new universe. He\nalso has a book out now.\nImperial College\u2019s own evolutionary biologist\nArmand Leroi has presented a number of TV programmes including Channel 4\u2019s \u2018Mutants\u2019, based\non his award winning book of the same name, and\nmore recently \u2018What Darwin Didn\u2019t Know\u2019 on BBC\nFour. This show was a fantastic exposition of modern biology with a really interesting perspective on\nevolutionary development.\nYes, the graphics were good and the subject matter was unquestionably timely given the Darwin celebrations of last year, but what really made it work\nwas the personality behind the production. Leroi is\na communicator just as much as he is a scientist\nand this shines through with passion. He\u2019s not the\nonly one though.\nImperial actually has a good track record for getting its scientists in front of the cameras. Olivia Judson, now working in Berlin, was the Dr Tatiana of\nher eponymous book and Channel 4 show highlighting the sexual diversity of the tree of life. And then\nthere\u2019s Lord Professor Robert Winston and Professor David Nutt.\nScientific discovery doesn\u2019t occur in isolation, but\nin the thick of a culture of passionate investigation,\namong failed and successful experiments, grant ap-plications, intrigue, infamy, boredom and creativity.\nIt happens in the natural world and the worlds that\nscience has created for itself: a hundred metres below the Franco-Swiss border at the LHC, high up on\nMount Kea in Hawaii for the Keck telescopes, or in\nthe solutions lab of the nearest chemistry depart-ment.\nAs Leroi pointed out to me \u201cthere\u2019s not one science that fits all\u201d, but there are two fundamental\nqualities that a successful popularisation of science must have: \u201cfirstly, it must be new and excit-ing, and secondly, it must be really, really true\u201d. The\nbalancing act between these two will inevitably lead\nto compromises and as Leroi says, \u201csometimes it\nworks\u201d. Sometimes, it doesn\u2019t.\nDavid Carr\nMadeleine Staple\nStirred but not shaken\nQuick Comment\nScience on TV\nAs I sat down in the lecture theatre, I slowly\nbecame aware of a feeling that I was surround-ed. I looked around. The audience was a mass\nof white and grey hair, glasses, and suits. As a\nwhole, it was summed up by a rather elderly\nman who passed behind me, shouting to his\nwife: \u201cSorry dear, I was stuck behind a buffoon!\u201d I was slightly worried for my safety.\nProfessor Christopher Andrew was to talk\nabout \u2018Science, Technology and Secret Intelligence\u2019 as part of the Vincent Briscoe Annual\nSecurity Lecture. He was introduced to us as\nthe Official Historian of MI5, and he talked to\nus mostly as a historian, of times past.\nHe spoke of the ingenuity of the Soviet Union\nduring the Cold War \u2013 they gave the US a present of a replica of the Great Seal, which hung\nover the ambassador\u2019s desk for a few years. It\ncontained a tiny microphone; it had no battery\nor power pack, no wires, and was therefore\nvirtually undetectable. It was also ridiculously\nsimple \u2013 it worked just like a diaphragm. Quite\nembarrassing for the US, really.\nIn the midst of the Cold War, reports about\nthe weaponry of both sides were being greatly\nexaggerated. Each side worried about the oth-er, and at one time the tension was so high it\nseemed certain that one side would strike first\nin \u2018self-defence.\u2019 Professor Andrew put forth\nthe idea that it was intelligence \u2013 the spy kind,\nnot the witty kind \u2013 that stopped a nuclear\nwar. With imagery intelligence taken from spy\nplanes, each side could see that actually, it was\nnot as bad as they\u2019d thought, and there was no\nneed for a pre-emptive strike. With imagery in-telligence, the situation never escalated.\nThe spy plane that gave this information took\nseven months from the first contract to the first\ntest flight, according to Professor Andrew \u2013 a\ntrue testament to the scientists behind it. Some\nof the greatest codebreakers, although they\nmay not have always studied the sciences, certainly displayed very typical eccentric-scientist\nbehaviour. Dilly Knox \u2013 who broke an Enigma\ncode \u2013 was well known for doing all his best\nthinking in the bath. \u201cEureka!\u201d\nIt seemed that Professor Andrew was always\ntrying to move away from the image of James\nBond; as the Official Historian of MI5, it\u2019s important to remember that what he talks about\nis true. The man himself seemed completely\nbelievable. Compared to what he referred to as\n\u201cthe unconvincing plots of James Bond films\u201d,\nthe Professor knew what he was talking about.\nHe did seem to find the Ian Fleming spy quite\nfunny...he called Bond a \u201cbrand leader\u201d, and\nlater a gadget from \u201cFrom Russia With Love\u201d\na \u201chigh-tech homicidal briefcase.\u201d I feel he enjoyed quietly taking the piss.\nHe almost resembled a typical English spy,\nnow I think of it: he was distinguished, well-spoken (Cambridge, anybody?) and had an air\nof definite knowledge. He might be a Historian, but that\u2019s no reason for us to judge him. I\nthink the best way to describe him is just very,\nvery genuine... unlike the audience member I\nespied afterwards wearing a black overcoat and\nlarge black hat. I think he thought it was a spy\nconvention.\nIt was a shame that the average age of the audience was about 57 and that the most popular\nhair colour was grey, because Professor Christopher Andrews also talked about the future,\nand our role in it as scientists. He perceives\nthe two biggest security threats right now to\nbe \u201cInternational Terrorism\u201d and \u201cCyber Warfare\u201d.\nEven now, the Iranian nuclear programme is\nsuffering from hostile cyber attacks. A new US\ncyber command unit is being set up this month\nto tackle cyber threats. The 2006 attempted\naeroplane bombings, in which planes were\ntargeted leaving Heathrow for the US, were\naverted through constant surveillance. This\ncould not have happened without the technical\nsupport of many scientists and engineers. We\nprovide the technology, and without the tech-nology, there\u2019s not really a lot of point.\nProfessor Christopher Andrew ended his\nexplorative and very relevant lecture \u2013 with a\nrousing round of applause, old chap \u2013 with the\nwords, \u201cthere is a lot for Imperial College to\ndo.\u201d\nAnd I agree with him.\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: James Goldsack\nKatya-yani Vyas\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial\u2019s \u2018Green Team\u2019 dream big\nAlexander Karvelas\n\u2018Imperial College Green Dream\u2019, lead by\nundergraduate geology students Alexander\nKarvelas, Tom Wesby, Edoardo Borgomeo and\nCarmen Pinto, has set out to promote awareness of environmental issues within Imperial:\nits students, staff and campus.\nIn May earlier this year, Npower launched\nthe Npower Future Leaders Challenge 2010, a\nnationwide competition that challenges university students to conceive, develop and deliver\na project that will positively impact living sustainability within their local community with\na legacy. The two teams with the best projects\nwill be taken on a fortnight trip to the Arctic.\nThe initial task for the teams applying to the\nChallenge was to produce a 4-5 minute video\noutlining their proposals and goals for their independent projects. The competition attracted\napplications from across the country and Imperial College Green Dream was one of the 8\nteams to reach the final. Each team was then\ngiven a \u00a3400 cheque to put towards starting\ntheir project and an invitation to attend a weekend at Derwent Water in the Lake District.\nThe weekend involved a mixture of physical and mental exercises to test the physical\ncondition of the team but also their ability to\nwork together. The main physical challenges\ninvolved a 20km hike on and a canoe orienteering race on Derwent Water. The Imperial team\nshowed a lot of enthusiasm and made great\neffort throughout the weekend, obtaining the\nsecond highest score and demonstrating their\ndetermination to do well in this competition.\nLeading the \u2018Imperial College Green Team\u2019,\nAlexander Karvelas said: \u201cOverall a thoroughly enjoyable and challenging weekend! Scrambling around one of the most beautiful and scenic landscapes makes you comprehend what\nyou\u2019re trying to save! The inspiration we built\nup together as a team will push us to create and\nsustain a legacy with our campus projects. It\nmakes us want to look further and wider into\nLondon and beyond!\u201d\nThe team say: \u201cSpending time in such a\nscenic untouched part of the country has emphasised the importance of looking after the\nenvironment and the need to make positive\nchange. It is also worthwhile to mention that\nthe four team members travelled from London\nto Derwent Water by train and then by bicycle,\ntrying as much as possible to minimize their\nemissions.\u201d\nFollowing the weekend, the remaining finalists are now setting about working on the underlying purpose of the Challenge: to put into\npractice their proposals for making some contribution to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas\nemissions of their university.\nImperial College Green Dream, intend to implement a whole package of ideas by working\nwith their university as an institution as well\nas organising events with the aim of increasing awareness amongst the student body as a\nwhole. The university have given us massive\nsupport and now it\u2019s time to pay them back.\nAt the heart of these efforts will be setting up\nmechanisms to streamline and intensify the\ncreation of environmental policy for Imperial\nCollege London.\nGeology students save the environment\nMI5\u2019s official historian on science in the security service\n\n"

    "content": "I\nsn\u2019t it about time that everyone gave Wayne Rooney\na break? Let\u2019s get things\nstraight from the off. I am\nnot going to try to defend\nsome of Rooney\u2019s actions over\nthe past few months: some of his\noff-field behaviour is quite simply indefensible.\nAs for his form, just go easy on\nShrek. The age old saying that form is temporary and class is permanent\nwill certainly stand up in this case. Yes, Wayne had a bad World Cup,\nyes, his form for Manchester United since his injury against Bayern Munich in March has been questionable. But he is the most talented English\nfootballer of his generation and he is carrying a United side as weak as\nany since they first won the Premier League under Ferguson. Carrying\nnot only the nation\u2019s hopes, but one having the additional weight of one\nof the world\u2019s biggest clubs on your shoulders is enough to wear anyone\ndown.\nIt is important to remember that not only is Rooney no Ronaldo (in\nterms of pure footballing ability \u2013 Rooney more than makes up for this\nin his dedication and work rate) but in this weak united team there is no\nRooney or T*** from Argentina to support him.\nLast week, after announcing he wanted to leave Old Trafford for pastures new Rooney made a miraculous reversal and signed himself a new\n\u00a3250,000 a week contract. Should this make him Public Enemy Number\nOne? No. All he has done is negotiate a fair deal for a player of his qual-ity. In comparison to \u00a3250,000 a week for Yaya Toure of Man City, it\nseems a bargain. At the \u00a390,000 a week he was on before, Rooney was\narguably the best value for money player in any major European league.\nNow for United fans. Should they be getting up and shouting abuse at\nhim for his apparent disregard for their club? Again, almost certainly not\n\u2013 Wayne Rooney has arguably done the club a huge favour. With Giggs,\nScholes, Neville and Van de Saar set to retire in the near future significant investment in the squad is essential to keep up with the likes of\nChelsea and their noisy neighbours. Rooney has single handedly forced\nthe Glazers to cough up some money to invest in high quality replacements who are ready to win league titles now and for this United fans\nshould be singing his praise.\n20 felix\nFRIDAY 29 October 2010\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor: Anna Perman\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA\ns we enter the\nthick of the winter job application season, final\nyear students will\ndoubtlessly be vying for a lucrative starting salary in investment\nbanking. One 25 year-old has\npipped the lot, however, by securing a ludicrous \u00a3250,000/week deal.\nAnd whilst budding bankers will be working 16 hour days, sacrificing\ntheir weekends, and experiencing skyrocketing levels of stress, all this\nbright lad has to do is kick a ball for 90 minutes per week.\nTo be fair to Wayne Rooney, he will also be required to attend the\noccasional training session when he is not busy spending valuable time\nwith his \u00a31,000/night prostitute. Well, come on, give the guy a break - he\ndoes have a moaning pregnant WAG to deal with.\nPoor Wayne has had a difficult few months. The prime reason he is\npaid is to score goals. Yet he has not managed to net one from open play\nin all competitions this season, and tallied zero in the World Cup. But the\nfans were so unfair, being disloyal and booing him in South Africa \u2013 it\ntranspires that the deprived chappy was demoralised and concerned that\nhis counterparts at Manchester City were earning more than him. How\ndare we be so disrespectful, and how dare we intrude on his questionable\nout-of-hours habits\nWayne got so depressed recently that he threatened to leave Manchester United. Why? Didn\u2019t they pay him enough? Oh, no. Sorry, my mis-take. \u201cThe club lacks ambition.\u201d Come again? A club that has won the\nPremier League and FA Cup 11 times apiece, and the Champions League\n3 times lacks ambition? Well Wayne, you better leave \u2013 why not go to\nManchester City, a club whose greatest achievement was the FA Cup\nback in 1969.\nBut Wayne, why did you take such a radical U-turn and stay at your\nclub? Was it because they doubled your pay check? Oh, sorry, that\u2019s\nme being cynical again. It\u2019s because \u201cthe manager\u2019s a genius and it\u2019s\nhis belief and support that convinced me to stay.\u201d Wayne, your excuses\nare as thin as Michael McIntyre\u2019s comedy routine. And the next time\nyou accuse your fans of being disloyal, take a look in the mirror \u2013 you\nmight just see an adulterous, club-hopping, bald ape staring back at\nyou.\n\u201cAll he has done\nis negotiate a fair\ndeal for a player of\nhis quality\u201d\nTom Welch\n\u201cHis excuses are\nas thin as Michael\nMcIntyre\u2019s routine\u201d\nFreshers\u2019initiations are a\nchance to do something\nspecial that we should\nembrace\nCharles Betts\nA couple of years ago, at some rather remote University in England, a student died\nas a result of an initiation ceremony, apparently involving physical activity and alcohol.\nThe details were never quite made clear, but\nit left many Universities and Colleges across\nthe land with no option but to ban such ceremonies formally.\nThis of course, no one could argue with\n\u2014 it would seem dangerous and futile at\nbest, to attempt to. Our own College was\nparticularly clear on the matter. As one may\nexpect, Imperial students were able to adhere to this but retain a pervasive sense\nof celebration. Thus, I am pleased to say\nthat welcoming parties do still continue, despite the excesses reported of other places\nwhich would have otherwise damaged this\ntradition.\nIt does, however, raise the question of\nwhat they could or should be, instead.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 29 October 2010 11\nSCIENCE\nCan we live forever? Why do we age?\nAnd if a starfish can regrow its limbs,\nwhy can\u2019t we? These were the monumental questions addressed by Professor Nadia Rosenthal in the first of this\nyear\u2019s Friends of Imperial lecture series.\nAt first sight, \u2018The End of Ageing\u2019\ncould seem like a hubristic title for a lec-ture. But as Professor Rosenthal would\nexplain in an eye-opening hour, we are\nalready winning (aided no doubt by her\nground-breaking research) the battle\nagainst aging.\nBut the curiously modest (lecture\ntitles aside) professor explained, at the\nstart of her lecture, that the inspiration\nfor much of her research stems from her\nchildhood. Recalling her summers playing in rockpools on an island off Maine,\nshe said that it was the starfish, with\ntheir incredible regenerative ability,\nthat inspired her and her life\u2019s research.\nWatching these wonderful creatures,\nfrom summer to summer, caused her to\nask the question \u2018Why can\u2019t mammals\nregenerate?\u2019 And while she is yet to answer that question (she says we\u2019re just\nevolutionary losers), her research has\nshown that mammals can regenerate, if\nonly with a bit of genetic engineering.\nThe elusive goal is a world where humans could regrow their limbs. A world\nwhere that extraordinary ability isn\u2019t just\nthe preserve of the newt and the starfish.\nThe long and winding road to that goal\nbegins with a seemingly magic ingredi-ent: IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor\n1). This substance comes into play when\nthere is tissue damage. It promotes regeneration and regrowth and tellingly\nkids, who are much better at regeneration than adults, have a lot of IGF-1, and\nsteadily lose it as they age.\nArnold Schwarzenegger: Governor of\nCalifornia, film star and also, a mouse -one of Professor Rosenthal\u2019s genetically\nmodified mice. It\u2019s bigger and stronger\nthan your average mouse. Its muscles\nage slower, heal better and faster and\nhave a highly reduced tendency to atro-phy. Why? The Schwarzenegger mouse\nhas been genetically modified to produce more IGF-1 in its muscles.\nInterestingly, as Professor Rosenthal\nexplains, this miracle-like substance is\nlinked to white blood cells, specifically\nmacrophages. These cells which help\nform our formidable immune system,\nand perversely cause inflammation and\nhealth problems, have a Jekyll-and-Hyde\ncharacter. M1, the Mr Hyde in our anal-ogy, comes into play when we are injured and it bulldozes away any bacteria\nto protect us from infection. It then gives\nFighting the never-ending battle against ageing\nway to M2, the Jekyll of the macrophage\nworld, which encourages tissue regeneration and crucially secretes IGF-1. The\nflourish at the end of this process is that\nIGF-1 in turn stimulates more M2.\nAh now, we\u2019ve solved it, IGF-1 is the\nanswer, the solution to bald hair, wrinkled skin and age related degenerative\ndiseases. An injection of this Elixir of\nLife should do the job right? Wrong. It\nonly works when it has been released at\nthe site of the injury, immediately after\nthe injury. It stimulates chemokines,\nwhich act like molecular microphones\nand call other cells to help heal an in-jury. But not just any cells, bone marrow\nstem cells. The challenge is to engineer\ncertain cells to deliver IGF-1 in the right\nplace, at the right time to stimulate the\nprocess of regeneration.\nWe haven\u2019t traversed the entire length\nof the road towards regrowing our own\nlimbs (or more prosaically, repairing\ndamaged heart tissue) but thanks to Professor Rosenthal and her team, we do at\nleast have a road map.\nKadhim Shubber\nDiscover\nKing Abdullah University of Science and Technology\nA research university unlike any other.\nScholarships for Science and Engineering students\nComplete a Master\u2019s or Ph.D. programme with:\n\u00e0\u0144&ULL\u01444UITION\u01443UPPORT\u0144\u0144\u0144\u0144\u00e0\u0144,IVING\u0144!LLOWANCE\u0144\u0144\u0144\u0144\u00e0\u0144&REE\u0144(OUSING\u0144\u0144\u0144\u0144\u00e0\u0144-EDICAL\u0144)NSURANCE\u0144\u0144\u0144\u0144\u0144\u00e0\u01442ELOCATION\u01443UPPORT\u0144\n&OR\u0144MORE\u0144INFORMATION\u0144ABOUT\u0144APPLYING\u0144TO\u0144+!534\u0144PLEASE\u0144VISIT\u0144OUR\u0144WEB\u0144SITE\u0144AT\nwww.kaust.edu.sa\nDiscover bold, collaborative research initiatives in science, engineering and technology with state-of-the-art\nfacilities, globally renowned faculty and students from over 60 countries.

Go to the Puzzles section >>\nJ\nohn Matthew Stafford. That\nname is likely is likely to mean\nsomething to only a very select\nfew. Stafford was the number\none draft pick for the NFL in\n2009. That is to say that in 2009 Stafford was seen as the best young football\nplayer in America. NFL rules require\nplayers to be out of high school for to\nfull 2 years before they are eligible to\ncompete; the NBA and NHL have no\nsuch requirements and thus players including LeBron James are drafted from\nhigh school whilst the number one and\ntwo picks in the NHL draft were Taylor\nHall and Tyler Seguin, both of whom\nare 18. American sports are a huge deal\nfrom high school through college and\neventually the professional leagues. The\nAlamo and Memorial Stadia are both\nhigh school stadia; they seat 23,000 and\n20,000 respectively. The importance\nplaced on sport suddenly becomes clear.\nDue to the eligibility rule associated with the NFL, aspiring football\nplayers tend to target a college sports\nscholarship where they can showcase\ntheir talents by playing for their col-lege. Top collegiate teams have their\ngames broadcast on American television networks. At first glance a system\nwhich encourages emerging sport talent\nto progress through college allowing\nthem to hone their skills, play in front\nof crowds of up to 100,000 as well as\nproviding them with an education is a\ngood thing. However, all that glitters is\nnot gold. Many college football players\nplaying in the top tier divisions are not\nat college for an education, they\u2019re using\ncollege as a stepping stone towards the\nNFL. Therefore, top collegiate football\nteams are extremely professional in their\nstructure and how they\u2019re run; many\ncoaches go back and forth between the\nNFL and top college football teams. The\nfootball players are thus under extreme\npressure in order to train, attend analysis of games, attend team meetings, play\nmatches and then spend time on their\nacademic studies. In order to be eligible\nto play, the members of the squad are\nrequired to maintain good grades, with\nmany players having private tuition in\norder to produce the necessary grades.\nEven so, the demands of the collegiate football means that many players\nchoose relatively easy classes in order to\nachieve the grades they need and focus\nintently on their sporting progress.\nMany believe that American colleges\nare being transformed and it is coming\nat the expense of the players; official\nfigures suggest that around 70% of football team members ftom the top division\ngraduate from college. However, only\n53% of the Varsity team of the University of California, Berkley, an Ivy League\nschool graduated last year; such a low\nnumber was blamed on the demands\nwhich are put on young athletes.\nIndeed, Michael Orland who played in\nthe NFL and at Notre Dame University\nbelieves that his experience of collegiate\nfootball is much different than that experienced by youngsters today. Orland\nfeels he got the best type of education\non offer at Notre Dame as well as playing football at a very high level. According to Orland, the televised games\nand analysis on the television program\n\u2018Sports Centre\u2019 provides an opportunity\nto over scrutinise the players and that the\ndemands placed on the players is just\ntoo great with sporting gains coming at\nthe expensive of academia. But, if you\nmake it to the NFL, if you are a John\nStafford does it matter? Well of course\nnot, providing you prolong your career,\navoiding serious injury and continually\nplaying at the highest level in what is a\nvery fickle sport. The figure that do that\nis very small; 2.4% of college football\nplayers make it to the NFL, of those\nsome will succumb to serious injury or\nwill be end up being released from their\nteam. So what becomes of those who\ndon\u2019t fulfill their dreams and don\u2019t make\nit to the NFL; some graduate although it\nwould seem with questionable qualifications others don\u2019t graduate at all. And so\nthe years of both studying and training it\nwould appear, come to nothing and the\nfuture doesn\u2019t look so bright.\nMany are asking if such a system\nmakes sense? For the colleges it does; the\nUniversity of Texas made a revenue of\n$87million in 2008 with many suggesting that college players should be paid.\nOthers believe athletes becoming profes-sional, earning large sums of money so\nyoung can be detrimental and college\npromotes maturity. Could the structure\nof English sports be used to help, whereby young athletes progress through academies affiliated with professional clubs\nfor football, rugby and cricket among\nothers. Such a system may encourage\nonly those who are likely to succeed to\npersue a career in sport and turn profes-sional. Such a system has its own pitfalls\nand is open to scrutiny. Surely something needs to be done, afterall there are\nonly so many high-school coaching jobs\navailable for those talented athletes who\ndon\u2019t make the grade for the NFL.\n\n"

Lembit Opik gets some early practice\n\u201cBuilding a Fairer Britain\u201d \u2013 the slogan\nof the Liberal Democrat manifesto. Is\nthis just another promise that the Liberal Democrats have compromised on in\ntheir frantic grasp for power? A question\nnot only being asked by Liberal Democrat MPs, but one that is also at the forefront of public interest.\nThe announcement of the Conservative-led coalition government just 6\nmonths ago is still fresh in the memory\nof the public, and the question from\nthem still remains, can there be any gain\nfor the Liberal Democrats from this?\nEven at the very outset of the coalition\nit seemed plainly obvious to everyone\nthat it was the Liberal Democrats who\nwould, and have conceded nearly all of\ntheir manifesto promises. Comments\nlike these are often made in the media,\nbut what has the Liberal Democrat Party\nreally conceded in this coalition agree-ment?\nLet\u2019s address the long-nosed fat grey\nanimal in the room first, tuition fees. It\nhad been Lib Dem policy for some time\nnow to scrap tuition fees. With this being the case it would have been expected\nthat Vince Cable, Business Secretary\nand big campaigner against tuition\nfees, would have had a whisper in the\near of Nick Clegg before endorsing the\nBrowne Report. So concession number\n1, endorsement of possible tuition fee\nrises.\nThe comprehensive spending review announcement last Wednesday is\nequivalent to taking a lightsaber to the\nLiberal Democrat manifesto. First and\nforemost it increased the rate at which\nthe Liberal Democrats believe cuts to\nthe deficit should be made. Along with\nthis Nick Clegg endorsed and applauded\nthe chancellors announcement of a 50%\ncut in social housing budget, reduction\nof the police budget by 16% over 4 years\nand 490,000 public sector workers becoming unemployed. All of which are\nunthinkable compromises from the Lib\nDem manifesto promises of 3,000 more\npolice on the beat, only minor cuts in\n2011/2012 and a government that helps\nthe poorer in society. So that\u2019s concessions 2 \u2013 Lib Dem values 0.\nRight back at the start of this saga in\nMay, the Liberal Democrats made possibly some of the most damning U-turns\non their electoral promises. One of the\nmost decisive policies during the election was the commitment to not build\na new generation of nuclear power stations within the UK.\nThis U-turn on policy took no more\nthan a week after the formation of the\ncoalition, announced by Chris Huhne,\nwho described it as \u201cfailed technology\u201d. At the emergency budget in June\nit was announced that there would be a\nsteep VAT increase to 20%, something\nwhich Vince Cable and the Liberal\nDemocrats were unequivocally against.\nThis U-Turn should have spelled out\nto the Liberal Democrats that taking\nsuch compromises wasn\u2019t in the nature\nof their grass-roots members, with a\nYouGov/Brand Democracy survey, announcing that 48% of those who voted\nLib Dem were less likely to vote for\nthem again primarily due to the VAT\nincrease to 20%. Along with this, Harriet Harman\u2019s announcement that \u201chalf\nthe 30,000 new recruits are previous\nLabour supporters but regard voting\nas not enough to change things. A third\nare former Liberal Democrat supporters angry with the way in which Nick\nClegg formed a coalition government\u201d\nis a sure sign that things aren\u2019t all that\ngood for them.\nIt seems that the only real thing the\nLiberal Democrats appear to have got\nout of the bargain is a vote in commons\non a referendum on electoral reform, a\nbill which includes specific policies that\nare contrary to the their manifesto, such\nas reduction in the number of MPs. A\nreferendum in which Conservative MPs\nare able to campaign against it.\nThe question in all of this is not whether this coalition will survive, but rather\ncan the Liberal Democrats survive this\ncoalition?\nNick Brown argues Lib Dems have lost support\nShe\u2019s probably uneducated and unful-filled. Captive to her religion, subservient and invisible. These are just some\nof the inherent stereotypes that are embodied in our modern society, obscuring the Islamic female identity under\nthe guise of oppression and inequality.\nBut did Islam really intend to undermine\nthe female existence? If so, are Muslim\nwomen victims of a chauvinistic spiritual ideology or simply a misrepresentation by an unchanging historical label?\n\u2018Women in Islam \u2013 Dispelling Stereotypes\u2019, held by the Imperial Ahlul Bayt\nIslamic society, sought to unmask and\nchallenge this 3-dimensional debate, addressing and teasing those very stereotypes that are classically conditioned in\nour society. The event, held on Monday\n18th October, attracted an audience of\nmany demographics, faiths and ethnici-ties. Led by world-renowned speakers,\nthe audience were captivated in an interplay of historical and modern referenc-ing.\nAmina Inloes, who has an MA in Islamic Studies and currently teaches at\nthe Islamic College for Advanced Studies, London, resurrected the silenced\nvoice of the Muslim woman who was\nproactive, influential and well established even at the advent of the life of\nProphet Mohammed, the rebirth of\nwhom is testament alone to the strong\nfemale presence in Islam. Similarly,\nShelina Janmohamed, named by The\nTimes as one of the UK\u2019s 13 most influential Muslim women, challenged the\nmyths that stem from this polar debate.\nAs this award-winning author, journalist and blogger explored the levels of the\nIslamic gender hierarchy, and the presumed absence of female autonomy, it\nbecame evident that the roles of men and\nwomen in Islam were never intended to\nbe consanguineous but rather complementary to one another, in perfect syn-chrony. Thus, to argue that the only escape for a Muslim woman is to abandon\nIslam, is unethical and misguided.\nThe discussion was topical, current\nand academically debated, exploring\nthe many avenues of this tentative topic\nin an innovative and intricate manner.\nWhether or nor the stereotypes that arguably define Muslim women have been\neradicated is difficult to ascertain or\njudge. However, in all matters of stigma,\nit is indubitable that open discussion and\nfreedom of speech are far more effective at uprooting and remoulding misconceived ideas, and it is fair to say that\nthe Ahlul Bayt Society\u2019s event achieved\nthis.\non the journey towards acting on their values?\n\u201cThe audience were\ncaptivated\u201d\n\n"

The\nold lady used to live in an old and expansive country house in the remote reaches\nof England. The Actor plays a young Mr\nKipps and the other acts out the characters that he meets. The house sits beyond\nsome quicksand and that in turn lies by a\ntidal body of water that prevents visitors\nfrom reaching the property for most of\nthe day. Add to this a frequent and thick\nfog and the viewer starts to picture that\ntypical haunted house so often depicted\nin horror films.\nDon\u2019t let this deter you from experiencing a first rate show though, the play\nis far from an imitation of anything you\nwould likely have seen before. The success lies in the show\u2019s simplicity; for\nmost, a dark room and torch conjure\nup images of campfire amateur dramatics but hell this scene will turn even the\nmost hardened of people into insomni-acs.\nThe fortune is a claustrophobic the-The Woman in\nBlack\nJordi Brown\n\u201cblends classic\nhorror-film elements\nwith a twisted\nnarrative\u201d\n\u2018Til February at the Duke of York\u2019s\ntheatre, special performances this\nweekend, from \u00a315.\nThe Woman in Black has run for\n20 years, and is currently at the\nFortune Theatre, from \u00a316.50\nLike this earlier work, the play blends\nclassic horror-film elements with a\ntwisted narrative and blacker-than-black\nhumour. Production-wise, it\u2019s highly inventive - much of the play is set in near\ndarkness, with the actors often illuminated by a single spotlight. The clever\nset designs, surround-sound effects and\na host of other technical tricks all serve\nto keep the audience\u2019s senses in a state\nof heightened and nervous awareness. (I\nwon\u2019t give anything away, but suffice to\nsay I\u2019ll never view a bottle of TCP in the\nsame way again). The acting by the five-man cast is excellent throughout \u2013 special mention must go to co-writer Andy\nNyman as the intense parapsychologist\nDr Goodman..\nDiscretion prevents me from revealing\nany details of the plot, but it\u2019s an intelligent and engaging piece of writing that\nweaves several separate stories together.\nAlthough I had a feeling that the sense\nof apprehension could have been ratcheted up further in some of the earlier\nslow-moving sections, when the shocks\ndo come they are sudden and effective.\nAfter a while, the pervading gloom and\nunease begin to have a genuinely unsettling effect, which slowly grows as the\ndrama progresses. When the plot eventually starts to fold in on itself, the tension is brought to an almost unbearable\npeak until the final, sudden climax.\nAt which point, dear reader, I got a bit\nscared.\natre, the seats pact tightly together and\nthe upper levels near head height. This\nlends a hand in drawing the audience to-gether; a creepy nervousness resonates\nthrough the rows as everyone anticipates\nthat next fright. The simple ingredients\nof a small cast, humble set design and\nfew sound effects really lay the foundations for what is a superb ghost story.\n\u201cthe most terrifying\nnight out in a\ntheatre you will ever\nexperience\u201d\nIt is a wonder whether the actors are\nthemselves scared to death as they act\nout this play within a play or find it\nhard to not laugh. Both are very adept\nand put in a solid performance, Mears\u2019\nability to jump from character to character is especially noteworthy as is Wells\u2019\nemotional mastery. This is a good thing\ntoo, as the play relies on the grasp of the\naudience\u2019s imagination and emotional\nvulnerability throughout. Wells\u2019 char-acter, shut out by the inhabitants of the\nlocal town, depends on his spectators to\naccompany him on his journey through\nMrs Drablow\u2019s past. This works to great\neffect when, at one time in the play, he\nchooses to go back into the house and\nmy friend beside me, turns around, cries\n\u201cwhy, why?\u201d and grips my arm with\nsuch intensity that it shows it is really\nscaring her.\nThis is director Robin Herford\u2019s 21st\nyear in charge and The Woman in Black\nis still the most terrifying night out in a\ntheatre you will ever experience.\nThis is the Woman in Black - obviously this is actually a man.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 29 October 2010 9\nSCIENCE\nImagine an electric car powered by its\nchassis, with no need for a battery. This\nmay sound like an environmentalist\u2019s\nwet dream, but Emile Greenhalgh and\nhis multidisciplinary team of collaborators across College and Europe, might\nmake it happen sooner than you\u2019d ex-pect.\nThe largest problem facing manufacturers of electric cars is the issue of\nweight. Currently, an electric car, such\nas the Tesla Roadster, weighs 1200kg,\nof which 500kg is battery. A vast 76%\nof energy expenditure in electric cars\ncomes from having to move its own\nweight about. This figure rises to a staggering 98% when considering city driving alone.\nClearly the way forward for electric\ncar manufacturers is to reduce the car\u2019s\ndead weight. If the chassis could be\nused to help power the vehicle, carmakers would be killing two birds with one\nstone. Other than at Imperial, the majority of the research into structural batteries is being conducted in Sweden with\nSwerea and their composites division,\nSICOMP working alongside car manufacturers Volvo. They are all a part of the\nSTORAGE programme, a Europe-wide\ninitiative led by Imperial College, focusing on meeting the energy demands of\nfuture hybrid vehicles.\nA major issue to be considered when\ndealing with any battery-powered technology is the power spike. This is where\nDr Greenhalgh and his team in the\nComposites Centre come in, working\nin partnership with SICOMP. When an\nelectric car accelerates it draws a vast\namount of power in a short space of\ntime, draining the stored chemical energy of the battery. This sudden increase\nin the battery\u2019s output is detrimental\nto its overall performance. To get the\nmost out of a battery, the output should\nbe constant. In order to overcome the\ndamaging effects of these power spikes,\nEmile Greenhalgh et al have devised a\ncomposite material, made of layers of\nwoven carbon fibre seperated by glass\nfibre mats, which acts not only as a rigid\nmechanical structure, but also as a su-percapacitor, in order to level the load\non the battery.\nWith a large number of engineering\nobstacles involved in the manufacturing process, it\u2019s hardly surprising that\nGreenhalgh\u2019s team is multidisciplinary.\nDr Greenhalgh himself trained as a\nphysicist at Imperial. We also spoke to\nMilo Shaffer, a Materials Chemist who\nnotably is one of Imperial\u2019s youngest\nprofessors.\n\u201cThe timing is great,\u201d said Dr Greenhalgh. What started 5 years ago as a\ncommission from the MOD could see\nthe group\u2019s members rocket on to the\nrich list, according to Wired magazine.\nHowever, a fully integrated structural\nbattery is still some way off. That\u2019s\nnot to mention the hurdles that must be\novercome to get such a car approved\nfor commercial use. \u201cNot only would it\nhave to pass extensive crash-worthiness\ntests, it would also have to pass electri-Imperial Profile: #2\nDr Emile Greenhalgh\nComposite Materials\ncal safety tests\u2026There\u2019s a lack of specialists trained in both areas.\u201d\n\u201cIn nine to ten years time we could\nget rid of the battery altogether.\u201d Applications of this technology are wide-spread, ranging from aircraft to laptops.\nBasically anything that needs to be low-weight and/or portable.\n\u201cWe are still a long way off on power\nstorage,\u201d says Dr Greenhalgh. The prototype they have produced has caused\na stir and earned them larger grants for\nfurther research.\nIlse Daly\nAdam Falk\nCharlie Harvey\nM ini x-ray\nmadness\n\u201cLaser Technology is\nadvancing rapidly \u2013\nwe are optimistic\u201d\nWhen one mosquito becomes two\nA new study from Imperial College London has suggested that, in our race to\nbattle Malaria, a new threat has emerged.\nThe Anopheles gambiae is responsible\nfor about half of the 500 million Malarial cases in sub-Saharan Africa. It has\nbeen found that two physically identical\nstrains of mosquito are becoming separate species, known as \u2018M\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019.\nThere have been recent developments\nin combating mosquitoes and the diseases they carry. From new insecticides\nto genetic technology, much hope and\nmoney has been invested in new control\ntactics. However, this new discovery is\npotentially problematic for researchers.\n\u201cFrom our new studies, we can see\nthat mosquitoes are evolving more\nquickly than we thought and that un-fortunately, strategies that might work\nagainst one strain of mosquito might not\nbe effective against another. It\u2019s important to identify and monitor these hidden\ngenetic changes in mosquitoes if we are\nto succeed in bringing malaria under\ncontrol by targeting mosquitoes,\u201d said\nDr Mara Lawniczak, a lead researcher\nfrom the Imperial College London Division of Cell and Molecular Biology.\nPrevious research had indicated that\nthere was a genetic difference between\nthe two strains localised to specific parts\nof the mosquito chromosomes. However, in this, the most extensive analysis of both strains\u2019 genomes, it has been\nrevealed that the genetic differences are\nmore numerous and widely dispersed in\nthe genome than previously thought.\nIt is believed that the \u2018S\u2019 strain is the\nancestral species as it is found over all of\nBenjamin Good\nA next generation of table-top X-ray\nmachines could soon be made available,\nthanks to research from Imperial College.\nScientific and medical advances depend on the development of better diagnostic and analytical tools. Sources\nof high quality X-rays are in huge demand for scientific research, yet few\ndedicated synchrotron facilities exist\nworldwide due to their huge size and\ncost. The study, published in the journal\nNature Physics, outlined a future where\nthese high energy X-ray systems could\nbe housed in a chamber only 1 metre on\neach side. The Diamond Light Source\nsynchrotron, for comparison, is half a\nkilometre in circumference.\n\u201cThis is a very exciting development\u201d, said Dr Stefan Kneip, from Imperial\u2019s Department of Physics and lead\nauthor of the study. \u201cWe have taken the\nfirst steps to making it much easier and\ncheaper to produce very high energy,\nhigh quality X-rays.\u201d\nThe new technology uses a process\nsimilar to what happens in other synchrotron sources, but on a microscopic\nscale. A high power laser is fired into a\nstream of helium gas, creating a jet of\nionised plasma. A bubble of positively-charged helium ions forms, causing\nsome of the electrons in the plasma to\nform an energetic beam that \u2018wiggles\u2019.\nAs the electron beam wiggles it produces a high quality source of X-rays. While\nprevious laser driven X-ray sources ex-isted, this new technology will result in\nX-rays 1000x brighter.\nDr Zulfikar Najmudin, the leader of\nthe experimental team for this research,\nsaid: \u201cwe think a system like ours could\nhave many uses. For example, it could\neventually increase dramatically the\nresolution of medical imaging systems\nusing high energy X-rays, as well as enable microscopic cracks in aircraft engines to be observed more easily.\u201d\nDue to the high cost and complexity of high power lasers today, this new\ntechnology won\u2019t be on our laboratory\nbenches any time soon. Dr Nahmudin\nremains hopeful that his research will\nlead to cheaper sources of high quality\nX-rays soon, adding: \u201claser technology\nis advancing rapidly, so we are optimistic that in a few years there will be reliable and easy to use X-ray sources available that exploit our findings\u201d.\nsub-Saharan Africa; in contrast the \u2018M\u2019\nstrain is localised to more central and\nwestern areas of Africa. As well as this\nthe \u2018M\u2019strain seems to be better evolved\nto laying its eggs in rice paddy fields.\nThe next stage of the investigation\nwill involve the use of a specially designed genotyping chip which will help\nto detect whether or not these genetic\nvariations affect their inclination to become infected with malaria and other\nparasites.\nDespite this new development and the\nmosquito\u2019s well-deserved reputation as\na significant threat to human life, there\nis still plenty of hope and optimism that\ntreatment and control is heading in the\nright direction. Another lead researcher\nin the project Professor George Christophides concludes, \u201cOur studies help us\nto understand the makeup of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, so that we\ncan find new ways of preventing them\nfrom infecting people.\u201d\nNew mosquito strains have been found by researchers from Imperial\n\n"

However initial optimism quickly turned to\nnerves and doubt as the weather and our opponents\nmade their presence felt.

    "content": "\u201c\nFELIX Friday 29 October 2010 33\nGAMES\nit\u2019s written. The writers understand that sometimes morality is not just black or white, that\nthere is ambiguity and that it can be subjective\nwhich I feel is a great addition to role playing\ngames. You are forced to make awful decisions\nfor a greater good or to decide the better of two\nhorrific options. The central conflict between\nthe New California Republic (NCR) and Caesar\u2019s Legion sometimes hides this morality,\nand although it may seem like a simple fight\nbetween lawmakers and barbarians, it is impossible to say that either is a force for good and in\nthe entirety of the game you quite easily see the\nworst of both factions.\nBlack humour is very prevalent in New Vegas. On one corner of the map NCR Rangers\nare slowly changing into Ghouls due to overexposure to radiation without noticing. The absolute preposterousness of the situation forces\nyou to laugh despite the darker undertone running beneath it. The game leaves the depression\nof the apocalypse to express itself via the ruins\nand the landscape, which the writers play to\ntheir advantage to bring a more realistic feeling\nfrom the characters. They don\u2019t portray their\n\u201cFuturistic laser guns\nalong with old themed\nclothes and music give\nthe game a very surreal\natmosphere.\u201d\nF\nallout: New Vegas brings us back to\npost-apocalyptic America to travel\nthe vast wastelands once again. The\nstory begins with you awaking in a\nroom to discover you\u2019ve just gone\nthrough surgery after being found shot and left\nfor dead.\nYou immediately are given the option to design your character. The options here are very\nlimited \u2013 you are forced to start from a small\nnumber of presets with little room for change.\nTrying to create a character resembling you is\nnigh on impossible or at the very least extremely time consuming. Next you choose what style\nof character you wish to be by varying your\nstats, skills and perks. There is an extensive array of choices for what style you want to use: a\nconfident speaker, an agile thief, a technological expert or a raging semi-automatic wielding\ngunman. The possibilities really are endless\nand I feel this is an integral part of the game.\nThis whole chapter of the game is essential.\nIt very quickly closes off doors you may wish\nto follow in the future \u2013 you can\u2019t be a heavy-gunner shooting down every enemy in sight\nwhilst charismatically charming your way into\nmassive discounts at stores. The vast amount of\nchoices you have makes New Vegas feel unap-proachable. You must play to your characters\nstrengths and it\u2019s impossible to fulfil every role\nin one playing of the game. This can, of course,\nbe considered a positive as you can return to the\ngame hundreds of times, each playthrough ending up with a completely different character.\nGameplay will easily be recognised by experienced Fallout players yet is also easy to\npick up for newcomers. The tutorial teaches\nyou all the basics and is very easy to follow,\nand thankfully it\u2019s possible to skip if you\u2019re\na veteran Fallout player. While you can carry\nstraight on to the main story, the game allows\nyou to explore for yourself and find the quests\nthat interest you. I personally love the fact that\nI can wander through the wasteland exploring\nnew areas without feeling pressured to stick to\nthe main plot, which can often be a problem in\nmodern games.\nIt is easy to see that the game shows many\nsimilarities to the earlier Fallout 3, for example:\nthe combat, with the same VATS (Vault-TecAs-sisted Targeting System) allowing you to target\nlimbs or gun arms to cripple the enemy\u2019s ability\nto fight back. The aesthetic follows the same\nidea of crumbling buildings and vast amounts\nof dusty wasteland with the occasional shrubs\nand ruins giving a glance into a happier past.\nThe PIP-Boy still organises all your weapons,\narmour, quests and allows you to see the map.\nThe theme remains in a 50s style with many\nold songs which give an eerie atmosphere to\nthe game as you wander the far-reaching waste-land. The bizarre mixture of futuristic laser\nguns along with old themed clothes and music\ngives the game a very surreal atmosphere.\nNew Vegas is, however, a very different game\nfrom it\u2019s predecessor and that\u2019s due to how well\nNew Vegas comes up trumps\nFresh out of his Vault, Sean Harbinson is bowled over by Fallout: New Vegas\ndepression through their words but through\ntheir actions. This gives room for much darker\ncharacters to develop.\nThe greatest part of Fallout: New Vegas, as\nwith Fallout 3, is that you are never forced to\nfollow the main story line. It is possible to play\nthe game for hours whilst completing only side\nquests. The immeasurable wastelands give you\n400 locations to visit with 163 individual quests\nto complete. The Mojave Wasteland, where the\ngame takes place, is incredibly realistic and\nnot only through the impressive graphics. It\u2019s\na continuous mystery with so many unexpected\nturns. Unprompted by the main storyline you\nmay stumble across a terrible event that it\nwould have been easy to miss. Merely a side\nstory in the game, and yet so striking. Simply\nby exploring the ruins of Nevada you might find\nthe most interesting part of the game despite it\nnot being part of the main quests. The pure attention to detail of the smallest characters and\nthe areas to explore keeps the player interested\nthroughout. The clever dialogue returns along\nwith great writing and quest design. Characters\nare desperate, deceitful, suave, crude, or a mixture of all these features. This produces a more\nin depth story and a much more relatable game.\nThe voice acting has also improved allowing\nyou to connect to the game\u2019s hundreds of interlocking stories.\nThe new hardcore mode forces you to become a true wastelander. You must follow a\nnormal sleep pattern, keep hydrated and fight\noff hunger. You will end up collapsing onto\nwhatever roadside mattress you can find, lapping dirty water from toilet bowls and going\nthrough every bin and abandoned building to\nfind scraps of food just to survive. Skills which\nyou would normally ignore, such as Unarmed\nand Survival, end up being a necessity. It\u2019s not\nlike a \u2018Hard mode\u2019 which ends up giving your\nenemies vast amounts of ammo and infinite hit\npoints \u2013 it changes the way you play the game.\nAmmunition has weight giving you more reason to explore the improved variety of melee\nweapons. Stimpaks (the health packs) heal over\ntime rather than immediately and crippled limbs\ncan only be healed by doctors. Instead of focusing on your next quest you are forced to hunt\nfor water, food, a bed, or a \u2018doctor bag\u2019 to fix\nyour wounded appendages. This is a great new\nidea for the game and I thoroughly enjoyed it as\nit forces you to think outside the box in order to\ncomplete even the most basic of quests.\nThe combination of realistic graphics, great\nstoryline, in-depth characters and massive variety of choices make Fallout: New Vegas an\nimpressive game. It would easily be possible\nto play hundreds of times over without getting bored, especially with the new hardcore\nmode. Despite the similarities to Fallout 3 the\ngame reinvents itself with the style of writing\nand clever quests. If you enjoyed Fallout 3 then\nFallout: New Vegas is definitely a game for\nyou. Anyone who hasn\u2019t played Fallout before,\nI suggest that you start now!\nThis guy\u2019s meant to be dressed up as Darth Vader for Halloween. Oi mate, you\u2019re doing it wrong!\n\n"

The\nlive band has expanded to five mem-bers, replete with multiple keyboards\nand synths to aid the move away from\ntheir folkier debut to the \u201880s influenced\nprog-pop of the new album, and the light\nshow is suitably slick, complementing\nthe band\u2019s natural stage presence.\nOpening with a slow pulse and red\nlighting that segues into a seamless\nrendition of \u2018Madder Red\u2019 to rapturous\napplause, Yeasayer know they have the\ncrowd on their side and play with the\nforce and precision that they have been\ndutifully praised for. After this storming entrance however, an early lull occurs when the band overindulge on too\nmany weak album tracks. The switch to\nolder songs, reconfigured and reworked\nto better reflect their new sound, has\nmixed results; while the approach strips\n\u2018Red Cave\u2019 of its intimacy, the stunning\n\u2018Tightrope\u2019 remains unblemished and is\nMUSIC\nFELIX\nFriday 29 October 2010\n26\nMusic Editors: Greg Power\nLuke Turner\nChristopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nAlbum of The Week\nSteve Skaith\nLatin Quarter\nRevisited\nWestpark Publishing\n2010\nThis album is a re-working of much of the back catalogue from the 80\u2019s band Latin Quarter, released with\nnew technology but the same old message. Latin\nQuarter have something important to say, and they\u2019re\nnot afraid to do so through music, with their political activism ranging from racism, to man\u2019s dominion\nover animals.The songs keep the old themes echoing\nharmoniously 25 years on, with their african touches\nand folky guitaring, the music is diverse but simple,\nthe lyrics however hit a harder note. Ideas of morality\nand fainess highlighting some pressing issues this\nworld we live in has decided to neglect in an act of\nselfish ignorance. The point is that although released\n20 odd years ago, the change has been minimal, this\nis coming from a band that predicted the abolition\nof the apartheid.

After public outcry, John\nTerry was stripped of\nthe England captaincy\nbecause of his infidelity. Can you imagine getting chucked out of university\nbecause of your personal life?\nAnd speculation about whether\nBrangelina got together before or after\nhis split from Jen dominated the press\nfor what seemed like an age. Does it\nmatter? Does it affect you?\nI\u2019m not saying anger is unjustified, or\nthat being betrayed doesn\u2019t hurt like hell.\nJust that the punishment doesn\u2019t quite fit\nthe crime. Many of us have done it. And\nif you are sitting there thinking you have\nnever even been tempted\u2026well I\u2019m sor-ry, I simply don\u2019t believe you. When a\nrelationship is on the rocks, we reach out\nto someone who can give us what our\npartner cannot. Making spurious judgments about the lives of others is such\na waste of time, perhaps understanding\nmight be a bit more productive.\nWeirdly, my mother told me that when\nshe was young, her relationships had a\ntendency to overlap. As you can prob-Black Sheep\nably tell, my upbringing was quite a\nliberal one. Her \u2018experience\u2019 illuminates\nan important point. We all follow \u2018patterns\u2019 in our relationships, even people\nas lovely as my mum. Many of us will\nleave our boyfriend or girlfriend only\nwhen we find another person worth the\neffort. It takes a great deal of courage to\nend a relationship as soon as you realize\nyou are unhappy. Is it any wonder that\nsome of us will cheat before we realise\nexactly what we want? For some, infidelity is a sign of inner turmoil. Not only\nshould we avoid judgement, perhaps we\nshould even be sympathetic to these lost\nsouls.\nI can just hear you now. \u2018You wouldn\u2019t\nsay that if it happened to you\u2019. Yes, fair\nenough, I\u2019ve never been unfaithful, nor,\nto my knowledge, been cheated on my-self. But I have felt my eye wandering. I\ncan understand how angry my boyfriend\nwould have felt if he found that out, how\nhurt, how disrespected. In a sense, my\nattitude is actually more judgemental.\nI consider wanting to cheat as much of\na betrayal as actually doing it. But I\u2019m\nsure if we could see everything our partners were thinking, there would plenty\nto get angry about.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I do have a con-science, there are some things that are\njust plain wrong. Repeatedly lying to\nsomeone, either to maintain an affair or\nto have a lot of little ones, deserves our\nscorn (step forward Wayne Rooney).\nBut there are so many good people who\nhave done this. I fully admit to being capable of doing it.\nI guess it comes down to a sense that\nstaying with someone you don\u2019t care\nabout is just as hurtful as cheating on\nthem. If you feel your relationship getting stale, either work on it, or end it.\nIn my opinion, if people actually act on\ntheir adulterous impulses, it\u2019s a sign of\nweakness, or drunkenness, or both. It\nis not necessarily a sign of an immoral\ncharacter.\nTo assume that you would never, ever\ncheat given the opportunity is a big\nclaim. And one I think few people could\nhonestly make. So why waste time judging those who do?\nI\ndecided I\u2019d sit down and watch\nChannel 4\u2019s latest purchase, \u201cThe\nEvent\u201d, last week. Partly because\nthe advertising campaign had\ncaught my eye, but mostly because it didn\u2019t look anything like Lost.\nThis turned out to be wrong on a level\nso fundamentally obvious it was only\nmatched by the crushing inevitability of\nthe show\u2019s own plotline. The Event is a\npile of turgid poo-poo.\nLet me summarise for you. A computer games programmer has\u2026NO. WAKE\nUP. You see? You were beginning to\ndrift off already, weren\u2019t you? This is\nwhat this entire genre of television relies on - being so vague you just start\ndreaming up the missing sixty percent\nof the narrative so the writers don\u2019t have\nto bother.\nThe first episode was a horrific mishmash of plotlines which were presumably supposed to be excitingly open-ended - why is a plane being crashed\ninto the President\u2019s summer home? Who\nare these crow-faced aliens with strange\nabilities to distort the laws of physics?\nWhy is the saucepan-faced actor playing\nthe protagonist incapable of expressing\nemotion through facial expressions?\nYou\u2019re supposed to \u2018ooh\u2019 and \u2018aah\u2019 at\nthese, and then immediately mash the\n\u2018Record Series\u2019 button on your remote\nAngry Geek\nbefore the first ad break.\nExcept, as we all know, most of\nthese shows are written in episode or-der, with little or no idea how half of\nthe plot strands should end up. Lost\u2019s\nlaughable attempt at \u2018closure\u2019 in its\nfinal series turned out to be a hasty\npatching of plot holes and then a shrug\nof the shoulders in the direction of anything they couldn\u2019t explain sufficiently\nwith a flashback. The Event will be no\ndifferent.\nOf course, it looks like it might.\nThere\u2019s some edgy storytelling that\nflicks back and forth between timelines,\ncunningly re-using the same footage\nover and over again to pad out the epi-sodes. There\u2019s a shady military advisor\nhiding a secret project from a sceptical\nand honourable president. It\u2019s all pretty\ngroundbreaking.\nBut at the end of the day, you won\u2019t be\nwatching it because of its vacuum-like\nabsence of acting quality; or because\nthe dialogue ever makes it beyond sum-marising everything that is going on\naround the actors; you\u2019ll be watching it\nbecause it\u2019s failing to tell you the whole\nstory, and that has somehow become a\n\u2018technique\u2019.\nIt\u2019s not a technique. It\u2019s just a lazy way\nto avoid doing anything that would require a full arse of effort. Half of the reason people play videogames nowadays\nis that the dialogue and plot structure is\nno worse than the nonsense on TV, but\nat least there\u2019s the opportunity to jump\non people\u2019s heads while they\u2019re spewing the pointless plot advancement out\nat you. And if it gets too mysterious,\nyou can always just shoot the nearest,\nmost confusing thing until it explodes.\nIt\u2019s like being Sherlock Holmes, if the\nstories had been written by Quentin\nTarantino.\nAnyway, this leaves me at a loss for\nwhat to watch while I spike packs of\nHaribo with laxatives in preparation for\nthis Sunday\u2019s festival of reminding people why children are a bad idea, so this\nweekend I imagine I will just borrow\nthe CCTV tapes from a few local shops,\nswitch between them every ten seconds\nor so, and try and work out a plot from\nthe people coming and going. It\u2019ll be\njust as vague and equally enticing. Plus\nif I really come onto something, I might\nbe able to pitch it to Channel 4 in time\nfor next October\u2019s schedules.\nIf you\u2019d like to bang on endlessly\nabout the nuances of modern\ntelevision, don\u2019t forget that my\ninbox is always open to useless\ntwaddle - anangrygeek@gmail.com.\nKeep watching the skies.\nThe Event went off with a \u2018pfft\u2019\n\u201cThis genre of\ntelevision is so vague\nyou dream up the\nmissing narrative\nso the writers don\u2019t\nhave to\u201d\n\u201cCan you imagine\ngetting chucked out\nof university because\nof your personal\nlife?\u201d\nIntroducing...\nBlack Sheep\nIs infidelity really such a crime?\nHave your say on this article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nBlack sheep is our new anonymous column, giving you the\nchance to vent opinions which\ngo against the common wis-dom.

    "content": "SPORT\n45\nfelix FRIDAY 29 OCTOBER 2010\nJapan gets its\nsecond dose of\ntourists, this\ntime IC Judo\nThis summer saw three players of IC\nJudo visiting Japan in the frame of a\nBritish University Judo Association\ntraining tour. Wilhelm Kleiminger, Ben\nBrowne and Edouard Desclaux, all part\nof the team who secured a Bronze at the\nBUCS Team Championships in March,\nwere the three College representants;\nwith the rest of the delegation including\nUCL, Cambridge and Oxford players.\nShortly after landing in Tokyo, we\nrapidly realised we were not the only\ngaijin (understand foreigners) in town.\nPassing the door of our very first hostel,\nwe encountered our fellow IC Rugby\nBoys, recovering from what had seemed\nto be a very intoxicating night.\nAfter a week of travelling around\nthe mainland Honshu , including sake\nbrewery and temple visits in Takayama,\nSumo tournament in Nagoya, Gion traditional festival in Kyoto, we got back to\nTokyo, all set for the start of the training\ncamp.\nEdouard Desclaux Tokai University, just outside Tokyo\nwas our first stop. Tokai was renowned\nfor excelling in Sports and most importantly had recently won the National\nUniversity Championships, which represents the biggest of all team championships in Japan.\nThere we also met the rest of the\ncoaches and players, most of whom we\nknew from previous competitions.\nAfter a warm welcome by our Japanese host we got to settle down in our\nstudent accommodation were Portuguese and Swiss nationals team were\nalso headquartered; in preparation for\nthe Judo World Championships held in\nTokyo the following month.\nWe were then guided to the dojo\ngymnasium for our first training. Upon\narrival, we were not disappointed by\nthe training facilities: 1600m2 of mat\nsurface area filled with hundred of coli\nflowered eared bust most importantly\nstocky and very well trained Japanese\njudokas. Gym training started every\nmorning from 7am, followed by three\nhours of Judo in the afternoon, 6 days\na week on top of their university course.\nTechnically, it seemed like they came\nfrom another planet. They use a very\nsupple and explosive judo. Their very\nupright stance allows them to combine\nsweeps, hip and shoulder throw with\nstyle and elegance. What we were mostly amazed by was probably the culture\nof respect. On and off the mat, people\nalways minded great respect and dig-nity, especially towards the older senior.\nThis didn\u2019t prevented us, from time to\ntime, to end up getting thrown in the\nwall by the youngsters who wanted\nto show what they were made and establish themselves in front of the head\nsensei (understand ex-world champion\nCoaches).\nSlowly we got used to the intensity\nand technical level of the training, even-tually, managing to give the Japanese\nsome good fights.\nOur next stop was at Tokyo University, number one academically speak-ing, which were not as physically tough,\nalthough the quality of Judo and intensity was unchanged: 10 times 4 minutes\npractice with no rest killed more than\none of us. Highlights of our time spent\nin Tokyo also included a formal reception at the British embassy as well as\na memorable night in the Keio University old boys\u2019 members club. Finally we\nheaded to our final destination, the International Budo University near Chiba,\nsouth east of Tokyo, which marked the\nlast 5 days of our two week trip.\nThe very modernly designed university was based on the top of a hill and\nthe block of concrete reminded us of a\nprison. The intensity of training was the\nsame, although this time we could enjoyed some technical session with their\nex-World Champion head coach.\nAt night, the delegation found comfort in a delicious local tempura fried\nfood restaurant, before ending at the\nlocal convenience store for ice cream\nfor some and cold Asahi beer for oth-ers. Sometimes we were joined by a\nfew Japanese players to go to some local Isakaya, Japanese typed pub , who\ncould escape from their daily routine, although everyone was up at 6.30 the next\nday for the morning jog...

Already, it is a topic that\nhas been endlessly deconstructed and\nanalysed and which every student in Imperial and the UK feels strongly about.\nTwo weeks have passed since then and\nImperial College Union Council will\nformally meet on Monday to debate and\ndecide the Union\u2019s Higher Education\nFunding Policy.\nFirstly, the policy put forward recognises the need for a shake-up in the\nway universities are funded.

The reshuffling of the Life Sciences\ndepartment at Imperial is another way\nuniversities have been trying to deal\nwith this shortfall.\nThe Union is largely supportive of\nLord Browne\u2019s recommendations. It\nbelieves that raising the threshold for\nrepayment to \u00a321,000 means that most\nPhD students will not have to repay their\nloan while working towards their PhD.\nIt backs the raising of maintenance\nloans and grants, resolving to increase\nbursary and scholarship provision, and\nto promote opportunities for these more\nreadily. It will also try to encourage businesses to provide their own bursaries for\nstudents. Together, these will hopefully\nreduce the amount of loans that all but\nthe richest students will have to repay.\nOn this subject, the Rector has formed\na new committee to look at how the\nuniversity provides bursaries, with the\nview to increase them. The Union has\nbeen invited to take an active role in this\ncommittee. If an improved endowment\nscheme is drawn up, the Council will\nconsider whether commercial revenue\nfrom the Union (from FiveSixEight and\nICU Shop, for example) should be fed\ninto such a scheme.\nHowever, it also backs the Review\u2019s\nsuggestion of a levy after \u00a36000 per\nyear on the price of a degree. This will\nincentivise universities to only charge\nthe real cost of a degree. It is also hoped\nto discourage universities from selecting\napplicants based on their bank balance\ninstead of their personal statement.\nThe Union feels that the Browne Review lacked details towards postgradu-Rhys Davies\nGet there faster.

It also welcomes the realisation\nin the Review that universities are in\ndire need of more investment. In asking\nstudents to shoulder more of the cost\nbut recommending the spreading of\nrepayment, it believes the Browne Review has struck a fine balance and has\npointed the direction for fairer funding\nfor universities. Thus, the Union has\ndecided to support Lord Browne in his\nproposals.\n\n"

You need the iOS version of the goto media player, VLC, on your iPhone. Sorted.\nRockPlayer for Android can play virtually every format\nunder the sun, and with aplomb. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to play video files, the free RockPlayer is a must.\nAndroid - Rockplay for Android\nThe iOS App Store: over 250,000 apps and\nmore than 6.5 billion downloads onto 120 million iPads, iPhones and iPod touches, which\nare themselves growing, at a rate of 230,000\ndevices per day.\nThe numbers are staggering, even more so\nwhen you consider that the store is only two\nyears old; the App Store concept has been tremendously successful for Apple\u2019s mobile plat-form, but what\u2019s next?\nLast week Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple, announced the new Mac App Store \u2013 a place to\ndiscover, purchase, and install applications for\nyour Macintosh computer.\nThe obligatory technology blog coverage\nsurrounding the Apple press event made the\nnew store sound like a potential game chang-ing, maybe even revolutionary, new way to get\napplications. Imagine thousands of applications available to purchase and install at the\nclick of the mouse. No serial numbers to type\nin, no installers to deal with, just instant grati-fication. But is this just another example of the\nJobs \u2018reality distortion field\u2019 causing the media\nto applaud every word that he utters?\nPerhaps it is best to start with what appears\nto be wrong with the Mac App Store. It will\ninevitably become the de facto place for developers to sell their applications, and the go-to\nplace for consumers.\nJobs said that it will not be the only way to\ninstall applications, but the average first time\nconsumer will click on the Mac App Store icon\nwhen prompted, as they turn on their shiny\nnew computer for the first time, and think that\nit\u2019s the only way. The iOS App Store is often\ncriticised for being overly restrictive, with\nApple explaining that this is to improve the\nconsumer\u2019s experience by preventing \u2018buggy\u2019\napplications and \u2018questionable content\u2019. The\nnewly published review guidelines for the\nMac App Store specifically prohibit games,\n\u2018Russian Roulette\u2019for example; perhaps Apple\nhave had some bad experiences in their Californian headquarters?\nAt any rate, inside the iOS Store, there is a\ndefinite \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 with application\nprices. There appears to be an emphasis on\nquantity, not quality, and this could make its\nway across to the desktop. Developers could\nspend less time developing good quality applications if they can only get a small amount\nof money from the consumers, especially once\nApple has taken its cut of the proceeds.\nThey must also write their applications using Apple\u2019s own developer tools, which may\nnot mean much to the average consumer, but it\nwill make it harder for developers to sell cross\nplatform applications such as Matlab, in the\nMac App Store. Also expressly prohibited are\nplug-ins, such as Adobe Flash, although given\nApple\u2019s resistance to Flash on iOS devices it\ncomes as no real surprise.\nMaybe I am being overly harsh, and simply\nobjecting to change. In my opinion, the process of installing applications currently within\nMac OS X can be confusing for new users,\nwith applications coming with or without in-stallers, simply packaged within virtual disks\nor just compressed straight into a ZIP file.\nUsers will never have to deal with installers\nor dragging applications into the application\nfolder, if the only source of applications is the\nMac App Store. Yet I haven\u2019t even mentioned\nwhat could become one of the most important\nbenefits of only installing applications from a\n\u2018walled garden\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m referring of course to\nsecurity.\nMacintosh users are currently not the main\ntarget for malicious attacks, with only a small\nproportion of computers worldwide running\nMac OS X, but this will likely change one day\nonce it becomes \u2018profitable\u2019 to attack Macs.\nThe Mac App Store would provide a place to\nget applications that are not infected or mali-cious, and if there are any security holes in ap-plications, they can be updated with a single\nclick.\nAdditionally the potential to have every\nMacintosh user see your application on their\nnew computer will attract new developers to\nthe Mac platform; therefore the variety of applications will increase (if the large number of\ncompeting applications, and likelihood of low\nprices do not put off developers). The concept\nof being able to install proper desktop applications with a single click is certainly appealing;\ncheap applications that are easily accessible\nlead to impulse purchases (I\u2019m looking at you\nSuper Monkey Ball!). You may even be able\nto purchase and install Adobe Creative Suite\nMaster Edition or the newly announced AutoCad 2011 for Mac OS X with a single click,\nalthough with the former being almost 30GB\nin size I would not recommend downloading it\nat College or in halls.\nImagine if Microsoft were to implement a\nsimilar idea on Windows? Ignoring the accusations of a monopoly, and the likely EU antitrust lawsuits, it could make software more\nsecure if every application has to be individually reviewed, allowing consumers to easily\nkeep applications up to date and patch security\nholes.\nWill the Mac App Store change the way we\ndiscover applications on our personal comput-ers? It opens in less than three months; until\nthen we can only speculate.\nThe Mac App Store\nCraig Buchanan\n\n"

The recurve and compound bows.\nRecurve archery is the more familiar, since the\nbow most resembles a traditional bow, and uses\nthe same basic principles. However the equipment\nhas become consideraby more advanced in the last\n40 or so years. The riser, or handle, is usually made\nfrom aluminium and the limbs (the bendy bits) are\nmade from carbon fibre or laminated woods. Arrows\nhave also come a long way, and are now made from\nextruded aluminium or carbon.\nTarget archery in its current form has been an\nOlympic sport since 1972, where it was reintroduced after a 52 year absence from the competi-tion. This year saw the successful reintroduction of\narchery into the commonwealth games, where the\nEnglish team won a total of seven medals, with four\ngolds! There are over 250 archery clubs in the South\nEast of England alone, and over 40 university clubs\nactively competing.\nDespite the technological advances in archery, the\nfundamental principles of accurate shooting remain\nthe same, which may explain why long after the bow\nand arrow\u2019s use in warfare is over, it still remains an\nenduring sport.\nJordan Muscatello\nWhat is Archery?\nWant to be Robin Hood?\nThen go to IC Archery\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s social, it\u2019s different\u201d are the wise\nwords of this year\u2019s archery club captain Stephen Wood when asked why people should\ntry archery. Founded in 2000 when it split off\nfrom the rifle and pistol club, the IC archery\nclub is a highly successful university archery\nteam that welcomes both experienced players\nand novices. The club competes against nine\nother teams in the south east archery league\nand are current indoor and outdoor champions.\nThey also compete in BUCS, where uni teams\nfrom all over the country turn up to compete\nagainst each other. \u201cIt\u2019s a very inclusive com-petition, we take as many competitors as we\nwant, there\u2019s no A and B team; everyone who\nwants to can shoot\u201d. The club did well finishing fourth in the indoor competition this year.\nIn terms of new members, the club had an\nexcellent freshers fair with 265 people signing\nup- something of a record for the club. \u201cTurn\nout has been great, at the first have a go session there were 60-70 people, it was manic.\nThe freshers are showing great enthusiasm\nand everyone\u2019s integrating really well which\nis nice to see\u201d. Their new captain is also keen\nto emphasize that no previous experience is\nneeded: highlighted by the fact that they kindly\n(or foolishly) let me have a go at one of their\nnovice sessions. Having managed to avoid\nshooting my fellow archers, I can also confirm\nthat it\u2019s not a problem if you\u2019ve never done it\nbefore.\nThe novice training course has now been\nrunning for two weeks and allows the novices\nto shoot on their own, receiving coaching from\nthe senior members of the club. The sessions\nseem to be fairly relaxed and flexible (you\ndon\u2019t need to attend the whole two hours if you\ndon\u2019t want to) and focus on a specific area of\nthe shot each week. With sessions on a Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday night (8-10pm) at\nWilson House it\u2019s quite easy for anyone who\nfancies giving it a go to fit it in one night a\nweek.\nSessions in the hall seem to be followed by\nsessions in the pub but the social side of the\nclub is something that the current committee\nare trying to improve. With the appointment\nof a social sec for the first time this year the\nclub is looking to add another string to its bow\n(apologies) by introducing more social events\nlike curry nights and a presence at ACC bar\nnights.\nSo how much will joining set you back? \u201cIt\u2019s\n\u00a339 to join and this includes all your equipment and all your tuition for the year\u201d, says\nStephen, \u201cif you want to buy kit you can but\nyou don\u2019t have to\u201d. Pretty reasonable then really compared with other ACC clubs. If you\nfancy giving it a try pop along to Wilson house\nor email archery@imperial.ac.uk for more in-formation.\nCarina Carter\nWhat you don\u2019t see is the next image, where his arrow splits the winning arrow in\ntwo! Oh, wait, no, that was Robin Hood, my bad...\nEd Lacey\nMen\u2019s Hockey\nImperial 1\u2019s 2 - 4 Hertforshire 1\u2019s\nIn the first game of ICHC 1st XI\u2019s BUCS cam-paign, confidence was riding high, on the back\nof a solid fresher intake into the 1st XI and the\nimproving JD making his 1st team debut. Having been relegated at the end of last season,\nICHC are looking for an immediate return to\nthe top flight of south-east BUCS hockey.\nThe first half was a hard fought affair, with\nmistakes on both sides leading to plenty of\ngoals. With seemingly any offence in the \u201925\nwarranting a short corner, it was a battle of\nthese much practised routines, a battle in which\nHerts came out on top, scoring 3 goals from\nshort corners, despite some heroic (read sui-cidal) defending from Matt James on the line.\nAs IC pressed in the early stages, a 60 yard\naerial from the herts defence caught IC nap-ping, as the herts forward rounded the keeper\nto slot in. The IC response was emphatic, with\nHockey: Slow start to\nseason for hockey men\u2019s\n1sts against Hertfordshire\na deadly break from midfield from Tom Koch,\nwhich ended with him rifling the ball into the\nbottom corner past a helpless goalkeeper. A\nherts short corner saw the home team take the\nlead again, but within minutes IC had equal-ised as captain Ewan Quince selflessly passed\nacross goal to leave a sitter for veteran Nick\nJones. With the scores level at 2-2 after 15 min-utes, a high scoring game looked likely. After a\ncouple of defensive errors from IC, herts converted another 2 short corners, leaving IC trailing at half time 4:2.\nAfter the break, with IC backing themselves\nto turnaround the 2 goal deficit, the dominance\nof IC was clear. With the majority of possession and a series of clear cut chances, the herts\ngoalkeeper was the only obstacle, making save\nafter save as IC ripped through the defence. As\nthe last 10 minutes dawned, with IC still failing\nto find a breakthrough, the start of season lack\nof fitness began to tell, and IC became more\nand more desperate. The second half ended\ngoalless, a rare occurrence in hockey, and herts\nwalked away 4:2 victors.\n\n"

Apparently amoebas simply don\u2019t care\nabout the amazing science behind barcodes\nand laser scanners, LOOK WILL YOU JUST\nGIVE ME THE BISCUITS AND LET ME DO\nIT!!!?\nSo how do we go about breaking down complex theories into simple digestible facts for\nsimple detestable people? Well firstly we need\nto be aware of the universal stupidity grading\nsystem. There are three grades of stupidity that\nyou should be aware of when approaching the\nsticky challenge of communicating with the\nmentally-inferior.

They tend to think\nthat they have a heightened understanding of\ntheir surroundings and an ability to see things\nthat others do not. This means that you can\ntell them absolutely anything and they will believe it. They will then try to make their own\ninterpretation and find some way of applying\nit to \u2018the human condition\u2019 or a pretentious\nphilosophical statement, e.g. \u2018If the gravitational force simply brings us closer together,\nthen perhaps love is also a force.\u2019 You can\nwrite that in your facebook quotations if you\nwant.\nAvoid any word that is even vaguely scien-tific. You will have to turn every theory; every\nformula into some really tenuous analogy\ninvolving elephants and mon-keys. They only understand\nspatial dimensions in\nunits of football pitches\nor buses and you should\nalways try to involve\nfriendly talking animals\nin your analogies. They\nhave an average attention\nspan of about three seconds,\nso try to bring in a new talking animal every time you see\nthem switching off.\nIt is futile even trying to explain anything\nto these people. This is because everything\namazes and confounds them. They wake up\nand go \u2018Wow, I just woke up! That\u2019s awesome!\nHow do we wake up? What is waking up?\u2019\nAfter thinking about this for an hour they will\nwalk down stairs and open the fridge, \u2018Wow!\nHow is it so cold? Everything inside here is\ncold! Fridges are awesome\u2019. After grabbing a\nbottle of milk and marvelling at its unworldly\nshape, they sit down and have some cornflakes,\n\u2018Oh my God! Cornflakes! What? What are\nthey? What are cornflakes? What? Who am I?\nAm I a cornflake?\u2019 As of yet, no-one has successfully managed to explain anything to a\nGRADE 3.\nThe Hangman Gradient of Stupidity\nGRADE 1 (Ignorant Stupid) GRADE 2 (Stupid Stupid) GRADE 3 (Clown Stupid)\nHow to explain the Large Hadron Collider to these people... well, I say \u2018people\u2019...\nGRADE 1 \u2013 (just regurgitate some Wikipedia\nand make up the rest) The large hadron collider\nis the world\u2019s largest particle accelerator with a\ncircumference of 27 kilometres. This synchrotron is designed to collide opposing particle\nbeams of either protons or lead nuclei, with the\nhope of answering some of physics\u2019 most fundamental questions. The collider operates on a\nquasi-symmetric dipole oscicalliminator and\nthe protons travel in a Guassian-Einsteinian\nvector-matrix formation. Analysis of the collision residue should determine the existence\nor non-existence of the Higgs\nBoson and quasi-anti-quasi-su- per-string-symmetric dimensions.\nGRADE 2 \u2013 Ok, the elephants are having a big\ncycle race. When the starting gun blows, half\nthe elephants cycle in the opposite direction.\nThe circuit is about the length of 270 football\npitches, so when the elephants meet half way\naround, they\u2019re travelling near the speed of\nlight \u2013 elephants are really good cyclists. Because they\u2019re travelling so fast, there is no way\nof stopping the gruesome collision. There are\nelephant limbs and bike wheels flying in every\ndirection. The scientists \u2013 who are monkeys \u2013\nare observing the horrific crash scene. Why? Because they\u2019re looking for something special; the\nHiggs Bos- err \u2013 a special key, which holds the\nanswers to many questions. They think the elephants have swallowed the special key and that\nsmashing them up is the only way to find it. No,\nthey can\u2019t just ask the elephants, or X-ray them,\nor make a duplicate key \u2013 LOOK THIS IS THE\nONLY WAY! No, the monkeys haven\u2019t found\nthe special key yet. No, that doesn\u2019t exonerate\nthe elephants. No the monkeys aren\u2019t working\nfor anybody. What do you mean you think the\ngiraffes are behind this? It\u2019s an analogy. An\nANALOG- ok, yes the giraffes are behind it all.\nGRADE 3 \u2013 The LHC, sorry the large hadron\ncollider, sorry the large proton collider, sorry\nthe large particle collider \u2013 the large really\nreally small football collider \u2013 What\u2019s a col-lider? Ok, the large really really small football\nsmasher-upper. Imagine a big race track and\nall the elephants are having a big cycle race.\nWhy? I don\u2019t know, to raise money for dying\ngazelle or wounded zebra or something. Because they all got shot by the giraffes. What?\nI don\u2019t know, because one of the zebras was\nhaving a secret love affair with one of the\ngiraffes. It\u2019s like Romeo and Juliet, but with\ngiraffes and zebras. I DON\u2019T KNOW WHY\nTHE ELEPHANTS GOT INVOLVED, GODDAMNIT CAN WE JUST GET BACK TO\nTHE FUCKING RACE!? Right ok, so it\u2019s\nthe big day and the elephants are getting their\nbikes ready. However, half of the Elephants\nthink it would be funny to race in the opposite direction. Of course it\u2019s not that funny\nwhen they meet halfway round the track and\nsmash into each other. There are limbs and\nbike chains flying in every direction; a truly\ngruesome scene of blood and entangled guts.\n\n"

By Chris Richardson\nDrifting Through South Central \u2019Nam\nI\nwas already well\u2013acquainted\nwith Vietnam\u2019s somewhat inconvenient electricity shortages\nand Facebook firewall (hey, who\nneeds an international social networking site when you\u2019ve got access\nto \u2018go.vn\u2019, where the Communist Party\nare more than happy to be your \u2018friend\u2019)\nby the time I arrived in Nha Trang, a\nquaint little town in the South Central\nCoast. Unfortunately this place is often\ntwinned with Koh Phangan, Thailand\u2019s\ninfamous full moon party island, when\nin actual fact it has a lot of hidden pleasures beyond the cheap beer and easy\ngirls (and/or guys).\nNight buses and trains are the way\nforward: not only do they save you\nmoney that you\u2019d otherwise fork out\non accommodation (negligible as that\namount may be), but they also allow you\nto maximise your exposure to sunlight\nin these exotic places. I relied on them\nhand and began to set the agenda. After soaking up some rays we hopped\non some bikes and headed for the mud\nspa. The mud spa was the beginning of\nthe end of my camera but did my skin\nwonders: obviously its claims of healing powers weren\u2019t at all mythical. It\nwas quite the hotspot for Asian tourists\nwho all wanted photos taken with me for\nsome reason, which kind of killed the\nmellow atmosphere, but whatever. We\nsmothered ourselves in tepid, creamy\nmud before showering and heading to\nsome good old temples.\nBy this point I wasn\u2019t \u2018all templed out\u2019\nand the novelty of all things old was still\nglistening. The Po Nagar Cham Towers,\nbuilt by the Cham civilization sometime\nbetween the 7th and 12th century, were\nquite spectacular. I guess it\u2019s a little like\nAngkor Wat but much more condensed\nand placed on a hill. The intriguing ar-chitecture, lively dancing from performers and agreeable aromas from incense\nsticks made the climb well worth it. I\ndon\u2019t know why but I still find it a little\nweird when Buddhist monks ride around\non choppers and whip out their digital\ncameras to take some cheeky snaps \u2013 it\njust doesn\u2019t fit the image at all. Anyway,\nthe hill offered a superb view of the\ntown below.\nIf you haven\u2019t tried Vietnamese\ncuisine I\u2019d highly recommend it, particularly the obvious choice of \u2018pho\u2019,\n\u2019nam\u2019s national dish. Like most of the\ndishes in this part of the world, such\nsimple ingredients somehow manage\nto conjure up amazing flavours that get\nyou craving for more. It was also here\nthat I developed my undying passion\nfor Vietnamese coffee, best mixed with\na drizzle of condensed milk and poured\nover ice. But the real gem is Bia Hoi,\na pitcher of mighty fine beer that\u2019ll set\nyou back a whopping 50p and get you\nabsolutely tinselled. We indulged in all\nof the above and checked out the allegedly booming nightlife. Unfortunately\nthe punters were mostly disillusioned\nAussie diving instructors and their\nnewly-found Vietnamese wives: isn\u2019t\ntrue love magical?\nThe next day was a little more cultured as we got well off the beaten track\ncheery I\u2019ve come across to date. It\u2019s a\nshame that a lot of travellers don\u2019t do\nthis more often: the breeze in your hair\nas you zoom around on your bike is a\ngreat substitute to bus air-conditioning\nand you get to converse with the local\npeople so much more. It may seem intimidating to do this kind of thing but\nin reality, you\u2019re probably a lot safer\nin these kinds of places than walking\nthrough Central London.\nA few of the characters I\u2019d met decided to head over to Vin Pearl, a water park\nmuch like the ones you can find back\nhome. I\u2019m still not sure why you\u2019d jet\nacross the world to get involved in this\nkind of thing when there are so many\nbetter things at your disposal. Instead I\nwent on a mission in search of the Ba Ho\nwaterfalls, famous for their crystal clear\nwaters \u2013 the perfect place to unwind and\nget away from the clutches of the water\npark. Two hours and a bucket of sweat\nlater and I was stood atop the ultimate\nwaterfall gazing into the distance, admiring the forest and the lack of people\nin the vicinity.\nAfter an unexpected encounter with a\nbloody massive (and probably harmless)\nspider I took another little trip to Bia\nHoi, quickly guzzled down a few glasses\nof beer, and headed further up the coast\nto Hoi An. A far cry from the anticipated reclusiveness induced by a bitter\nregime, fun-loving Vietnam was quickly\nturning out to be a favourite destination:\nmy only real regret is that I didn\u2019t stay\nfor longer. Next time, next time.\nInspired by Aussie divers, we set off in search of wives Little did I know that my camera was in my pocket all along\nA bit of strategic photo\u2013cropping and you\u2019re left with paradise\nheavily throughout my travels and got\nused to the sleep deprivation induced by\nthe stench of nearby feet. In retrospect\nthe smell was probably coming from\nme. So I hopped off of the bus and was\nin sunny Nha Trang. I wandered aimlessly attempting to find a guesthouse\nbased on a recommendation from back\nin Cambodia, and eventually stumbled\nacross it, only to find that single and\ndorm rooms were full. Thankfully the\nextrovert within compelled me to have a\ntwo\u2013minute icebreaker with a guy in the\nlobby who was also looking for a room:\nafter a quick assessment I decided that\nhe wasn\u2019t going to kill me and he\u2019d be a\nsuitable room buddy for the time being,\nand we checked into a twin.\nFor some reason we were charged the\nfull amount for an air-conditioned room\n(an extra 50p \u2013 big whoop) despite the\nfact that the power was set to be off for\na couple of days for reasons I still don\u2019t\nfully understand. So we took off to the\nbeach with Lonely Planets and beers in\n\u201cWho needs an international social\nnetworking site when\nyou\u2019ve got access\nto \u2018go.vn\u2019, where the\nCommunist Party is\nmore than happy to\nbe your \u2018friend\u2019\u201d\nand motorcycled up the coast and into\nthe mountains. Travelling by bike certainly beats the bus, and I\u2019ll be bearing\nthis fact in mind on my next trip. We got\nto interact so much more with the places\nwe visited: every time we rode through\na fishing village we\u2019d slow down to soak\nup the atmosphere a little, and every so\noften we were greeted by local children\nwho just wanted to say \u2018hi\u2019 or wanted us\nto join in on a ball game. In spite of the\nhorrors imposed on them, these people\nare still amongst the most hospitable and\n\u201cIn spite of the horrors imposed on\nthem, these people\nare still amongst the\nmost hospitable and\ncheery I\u2019ve come\nacross to date\u201d\n\n"

But I was here for their steak. I\u2019m not\nreferring to the sort offered by the typical Aberdeen Angus Steakhouse chain littered around\nmost tourist hotspots. Nor am I alluding to the\nwholly unsatisfying, thin-cut variety served\nslathered avec une sauce-we-cannot-pronounce.\nI\u2019m talking about the no-nonsense, unadulterated steak - and the Argentines are the experts.\nSo, does the product live up to its reputation?\nAbsolutely.\nEl Gaucho\u2019s selling point is flavour backed\nby authenticity. On tasting a selection of their\nmost popular cuts, neither was compromised.\nRib-eye, Sirloin, Rump and Fillet are all on\nthe menu, and the staff are more than happy\nto explain the differences between them with\nregard to flavour, fat and texture to those of us\nwho are not yet aficionados on such epicurean\nsubtleties.\nBife Angosto A Caballo (\u00a316.90), twelve\nounces of prime Argentine sirloin, arrives on a\nsizzling hot-plate, served the authentic way \u2013\ntopped with two fried eggs.

The taste did not disappoint\n\u2013 perfectly seasoned on the outside, allowing\nthe natural flavour of the succulent pink meat\nto follow through. This is a steak that speaks\nfor itself. No need for sauces, no elaborate gar-nishes, just a cut of Argentina\u2019s finest export,\nserved in the traditional manner.\nThe waitress,Anna-Maria, tells me their meat\nis imported weekly from Argentina, from cows\nreared on open ranges, fed on rich green pas-tures. In short, bovine mecca. As we emerged\ndiscreetly from the basement of this hidden\nestablishment, satiated from our meaty fix, we\nsmugly yet seamlessly blended back into the\nthrong of the crowd.

Opening hours 10am-6pm.\nwhich, on second thoughts, it probably is.\nBeing a newbie to IC means I didn\u2019t have the\nprivilege of enjoying the old menu, but I\u2019ve\ndone my extensive research (asking the boss) to\nfind out what\u2019s new and most improved.\nMost of the snacks are new to the menu like\nthe samosas and haddock and spring onion fish-cakes and you can even get yourself some wasabi tempura vegetables, all these bringing a bit\nof much needed diversity to the menu. Nachos\nreturn as an old favourite, now with a combination of three dips and they even comes in sharing size! Nice. For the healthier of you, there are\ntwo new salads to choose from. A simple \u2018bistro\u2019 salad or a pretty decent Caprese. However,\nif you\u2019re normal, like the rest of us, you\u2019re going to be focusing on the right-hand side of the\nmenus looking at pizzas and burgers. The new\nTexana pizza has been an instant best seller as\nwell as the classic Napolina, both of which are\njust \u00a35.50 for 12\u201d. However, winning the award\nfor best newcomer has to be the FiveSixEight\nburger. Having not actually had one myself, I\u2019m\nbasing this on the fact the entire stock was eaten\nin two days. As they\u2019re made out of bison, the\nenvironment side of me is slightly worried at\nthis. To top it all off they also do desserts now\ntoo! A lemon tart, chocolate fondant and pecan\nand maple cheesecake. Come on, you must be a\nlittle tempted?\nAnyway, I just want people to know, there\u2019s\na new menu and it\u2019s fairly cheap. It\u2019s not Michelin starred dining and yes the menu is made\nfrom greaseproof paper, but who cares? It does\nthe job. The menu is well-priced so even if you\njust fancy a few (12) onion rings with some\nsweet chilli dip, you can get them for just \u00a31.50.\nSo, if you can\u2019t be bothered to cook (or mi-crowave) get down to the Union have a cheap\nyet ultimately satisfying meal and possibly (as\nI heard one guy, who I won\u2019t name, call it the\nother day) a \u201ccheeky snakey B\u201d too. Ouch.\n\n"

Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nLaurence Pope\n32\nSo we all know the zombie apocalypse is coming at some point, most likely arising from\nsome combination of a genetically modified\nvirus, a dodgy business venture and a mad Imperial graduate. When it does strike, what on\nEarth do you do? No idea? Well, after days\nof careful thought I\u2019ve come up with a list of\nfive important things you need to take into\nconsideration when you\u2019re battling though the\ninfected hordes, with additional notes supplied\nby my celebrity guest Chuck Greene, star and\nsurvivor of Dead Rising 2 and true zombie killing expert.\nMoving about in a zombie infected world is\nperilous on foot, yet most roads will be locked\nup with abandoned cars and trucks. If travelling\nalone, a motorcycle or dirt bike may be your\nbest bet. If in a group, finding a heavy truck to\nplough through the vehicular blockade would\nbe a shrewd decision. Don\u2019t forget to scavenge\nfor petrol and diesel as both will become very\nsought after resources. Let\u2019s get Chuck\u2019s word\non this:\n4. Start your engines\n\u201cWhen fighting off the zombies in malls or\nclose quarters, gasoline based transport is im-practical. Two wheeled bicycles are too unsta-ble, so my preferred method of transport is the\ntricycle. My favourite one was a pink kiddie\u2019s\nbike \u2013 others laughed, but they weren\u2019t the ones\nsmugly pedalling their way to safety.\u201d\nCHUCK GREENE\u2019S TRANSPORT TIP:\nA vitally important issue, trust me on this one;\nwhat you wear determines how long you\u2019ll last\noutside in the cold, cruel world of the undead.\nBody armour is probably a sensible bet, as is\nany form of protective headgear. A belt or two\nto hook weaponry onto wouldn\u2019t go amiss ei-ther, but let\u2019s see what Chuck has to say on this\npoint.\n5. Dress to impress\n\u201cComfort is extremely important when trying\nto survive. Since there are very few people\naround to judge you, feel free to wear whatever the hell you want.

He gave the reason\nfor this expansion as increasing volatility in currency\nprices incentivising investors to be more active in\nmanaging their foreign exchange exposures.\n\u2018Inflation assult\u2019 on China\nChina\u2019s commerce minister has criticised the US\nfor pursuing anti-competitive policies. Speaking at a\ntrade fair on Tuesday, Chen Deming praised Chinese\nexporters but said that they face unfair obstacles\n\u201cbecause the United States\u2019 issuance of dollars is\nout of control and international commodity prices are\ncontinuing to rise.\u201d\nHe further claimed that \u201cChina is being attacked\nby imported inflation. The uncertainties of this are\ncausing firms big problems.\u201d\nThe comments follow weeks of heated exchanges\nas the US and China accuse each other of currency\nmanipulations and other infringments on prior agreements to liberalise their bilateral trade.\nBA criticises US on airport security\nThe Chairman of British Airways, Martin Broughton,\ntold the annual conference of the Airport Operators\nAssociation in London this week that some security\nmeasures at US airports were redundant.\nSingling out the requirements that passangers\nremove their shoes and have laptops separately\nchecked in particular, Broughton argued that the UK\nshould not \u201ckowtow\u201d to US demands on UK security\nprocedures, \u201cAmerica does not do internally a lot of\nthe things they demand that we do. We shouldn\u2019t\nstand for that.\u201d \u201cWe should say, \u2018We\u2019ll only do things\nwhich we consider to be essential and that you Americans also consider essential\u2019,\u201d he added.\nUK GDP growth boosts Coalition\nAccording to figures released by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday, the UK economy has\ngrown by 0.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2010.\nJust hours after the announcements, the ratings\nagency Standard and Poor\u2019s said that the spending\ncuts of the Coalitionmean that the UK will keep its\nAAA rating. The government has taken the news as\nencouraging to its bid to eliminate the record budget\ndeficit by 2015 through cuts that have so far slashed\n490,000 government jobs.\nAfter their meeting in Seoul, G-20 finance\nministers expressed optimisim that a much-hyped global currency war may yet be avoided.\nThoughts have now turned to the longer-term\nmotivations for countries to manipulate their\ncurrencies to help exporters, and measures that\ncan be taken against this.\nThe main focus of these concerns is the seemingly intractable dispute between the US and\nChina over capital flows and the exchange rate\nof the Renminbi (RMB). The US has accused\nBeijing of keeping its currency artificially low\nin order to boost its exports. US Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner hit the headlines recently\nwith his comments on China\u2019s currency ma-nipulation. China, on the other hand, remains\nimmutable in the face of protests from the West.\nDespite modest appreciation since September,\nthe RMB has hardly moved since July 2008.\nIn a floating rate system, currency values are\nallowed to fluctuate according to the demand\nand supply forces in the market. For example,\nwhen Chinese manufacturers sell their products\nin the US, they need to convert their earnings\nin US Dollars into RMB. This drives up the\ndemand for RMB and increases the amount of\nUS dollars available, hereby causing RMB to\nappreciate against the dollar.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China, however, can\nbuy USD and convert the excess Dollars into\ndollar-denominated assets such as US Treasury\nbonds, effectively preventing the currency from\ncirculating back into the market and propping\nup the value of US dollars. This offers Chinese\ngoods a price advantage overseas, boosting its\nexport-fueled growth. Estimates put the under-valuation from 15% to as much as 40% with\nrespect to USD.\nChina is not the only currency manipulator\nin the world. Almost every country controls the\nfluctuations of its currency to some extent to\ncreate a stable currency. Thailand, for instance,\nplaced capital controls to stem the volatile inflow of \u201chot money\u201d in October, in an attempt\nto prevent excessive appreciation of Thai Baht.\nThe US is hardly a helpless victim - it is weakening its own currency through a process called\n\u201cquantitive easing\u201d, which essentially involves\nprinting more money to buy government bonds.\nFurthermore, if history is anything to go by,\nChina can hardly be reassured by the possible\nrevaluation of its currency. In the last instance\nof a country demonstrating \u201cresponsibility and\ncommitment to an international monetary system\u201d, Japan ended up with a decade of deflation\nand stagnant growth.\nThe Plaza Accord of 1985 led to a deliberate\ndecline in the value of US Dollars, while at the\nsame time causing the Yen to almost double in\nvalue against USD. In the 1980s, Japan shared\nmany of the characteristics of present day China: a strong export-dependent economy, a relatively cheap exchange rate against the dollar,\nand a booming housing market.\nStrengthening the Yen is argued by some\neconomists to have indirectly led to the bursting\nof the asset price bubble in Japan that caused\nmisery in the years following. The US, on the\nother hand, used the same agreement to reduce\nits current account deficit and help its economy\nout of a recession. In the light of Japan\u2019s \u2018Lost\nDecade\u2019, China\u2019s reluctance to cave in to the\ndemands of the US Congress is understandable.\nThe wider implications of exchange rate policies have added twists and turns to the issue,\nsuch that the two countries are tangled up in\nan intricate web of interdependence. The US\ngovernment is running a large deficit for the\nstimulus program during the recession, which\nis mainly funded through government issued\nbonds. China, concerned about keeping its\nexport-oriented businesses open, swallows up\nlarge swathes of US government debt.\nHerein lies the paradox of the Sino-American dispute: the ability of the US government\nto run large deficits depends on the actions of\nChinese Central Bank to strengthen the Dollar.\nIf the Chinese no longer need to prop up the\nUSD, a Greek-style crisis may loom ahead for\nthe debt-ridden US government. Moreover, if\nRMB corrects for a 40% undervaluation, the\nmade-in-China goods in Walmart will receive a\nsimilar price hike. For a populace used to cheap\nRMB, changing its old habits will involve\nrather painful adjustments. A re-evaluation of\nRMB, therefore, may not have a happy ending\nfor everyone after all.\nThe competitive edge gained from an undervalued currency is often short lived and unsustainable in the long run. This is especially so\nwhen others soon follow. Trade advantages are\nderived from cheapening a currency relative to\nall others, but this is no longer possible when\nall the currencies devalue at the same time.\nBoth developed and emerging nations, from\nJapan to Colombia, have recently tried to drive\ndown the value of their currencies. A general\nweakening of currencies is now threatening the\nglobal economy, which has just begun to show\nsome signs of revival.\nSo far, there is more rhetoric than action in\nthe currency war between China and US, but if\nthe skirmishes continue to escalate, unpleasant\nmeasures such as a return to trade protectionism may soon follow.\nMuch of the progress made through years of\nexpanding international trade could be swiftly\nundone by belligerent states attempting to give\ntheir own exporters an edge. In the end, redressing the currency problems may prove to\nbe the art of choosing between the disastrous\nand the unpalatable.\nConcerns about the implications of a Sino-American\ncurrency devaluation race continue to rise\nG-20 finance ministers gather for a group photo at their recent meeting in Seoul\nLingxi Huang\n\n"

This is\nnot the case for this bizarre 70s murder mystery\nhorror, where the only mention of a lizard is a\npassing reference. That\u2019s not to claim that it\u2019s\nanything less than genius: with an eerie score\nto rival Psycho, blinding performances from\nthe cast and twists and turns in the plot, Lizard is sure to be a great addition to your horror\nrepertoire.\nThe trippy opening scene introduces our disgruntled protagonist, Carol, a corridor of nude\nhippies and a torrent of lesbian lust with a mysterious mistress. Needless to say this is possibly one of the most engaging openings I\u2019ve\never seen and sets the standard for the rest of\nthe film.\nIn a dream Carol butchers her mistress.\nStandard, were it not for the fact that the woman was also murdered in reality, which sets up a\njamboree of questions as the whodunnit keeps\nyou guessing. Action, suspense, and emotion\nthroughout, it\u2019s sure to make you leap from\nyour chair in surprise at several points. My\nonly criticism of this masterpiece would be that\nprobably the scariest thing in the whole film\nis the abundance of unkempt seventies pubic\nbush on display.\nChris Richardson\nClassic Cinema\nDonnie Darko\nThe eponymous character of Donnie Darko is a mentally disturbed, but in many ways distinctly average,\nteenager who barely escapes death when a jet engine crashes into his house while he is out sleep-walking. Aided by Frank, a hallucination of man in\na Halloween rabbit costume, he realises that this\nstrange event has created a time loop which will lead\nto the end of the world unless he can stop it.\nThis is a rather absurd concept but this is a story\nwhich thrives on the unusual and confusing. While\nsome might find this infuriating it gives the film a\nunique feel and perfectly mirrors the uncertainty and\nfear of the main character as he tries to figure out\nwhat is happening around him. Leaving things unclear forces the viewers to come to their own conclu-sions, a sure sign of a good movie. The atmosphere\nis helped by the striking visual imagery. Particularly\nmemorable are the scenes of Donnie\u2019s eye overlaid\nwith other images, such as Frank\u2019s hideous mask.\nWhile the film has a number of very unnerving mo-ments, such as Frank\u2019s sudden appearances and his\nunearthly voice, I particularly enjoyed watching Donnie\u2019s interactions with his family. Heartfelt moments\nsuch as his talks with his parents make us believe\nin, and care about, these characters. Fortunately\nthis complements, rather than clashes with, the\nmain themes and makes the tragic ending especially\npoignant. While not contributing to the main story\nthe moments of humour in the story were also very\nenjoyable, with Donnie\u2019s innovative use of swearing\nwhile arguing with his sister and his gym teacher\u2019s\nunbelievable naivety being particular highlights.\nSurprisingly the film also manages to touch on\nsome very serious issues. The best-developed is that\nof religion, as the characters realise that perhaps\nthe time loop cannot be explained by science alone\nand that there may be some force guiding them. On\nthe other hand we see the problems of authoritarian religious systems in Donnie\u2019s highly conservative\nschool, where personal and educational development is often stifled by a rigid system of values.\nThis film rightly deserves to be called a cult classic\nand, if you want to see something that makes you\nthink, I thoroughly recommend it.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nThe Heath Ledger jokes had gone too far this time\nFilm Editors: Matt Allinson\nJade Hoffman\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe title really gives most of the plot away before you\u2019ve begun. I sat down fully expecting\na cheap copy of every other zombie movie out\nthere, with visual effects rivalling those of the\noriginal Dawn of the Dead (some poor introductory camerawork, a trashy critique on city\nlife and some full frontal nudity in the first five\nminutes). This was going to be a long hour and\na half. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. In\nthis scenario, the dead, true to form, come back\nto life, but this time it\u2019s thanks to a parasite killer that uses \u201cultrasonic radiation\u201d to make creatures with simple nervous systems attack each\nother. Now I\u2019m not a scientist, but I thought\nmost types of radiation were ultrasonic, however we\u2019ll let the ambiguous science slip. Also\ntroubling was the questionable ethical committee that approved something which could enrage anything in a 5 mile radius, but then it is\njust a film. Apparently babies and the departed\nhave simple nervous systems, with predictable\nconsequences. Quite upsettingly, they didn\u2019t\ncash in on the mad baby swarm front. The\neviscerations looked convincing, as opposed to\nsomeone bursting a balloon of ketchup (which\nhas been tried before), and further bonus points\nshould be given to the plot, as it held together\nwell, and I did actually enjoy watching it, and\nnot in a \u2018it\u2019s so bad it\u2019s good\u2019way (think \u201cMega\nShark versus Giant Octopus\u201d). They had some\nnice self-parody with our protagonist stating\nthat the dead come back to life only \u201cin very\nbad paperback novels\u201d, and some comical\nscenes involving boobs being torn off. What\nmore could you ask for?\nThe acting was adequate, the effects and plot\nwere good, but the camerawork could have\nused a little oiling, and the sound-man was\nreally quite capricious. Worth a watch all the\nsame.\nJonathan Messing\nThe Living Dead at\nManchester Morgue\nThe Woman\nWith Lizard\u2019s Skin\nH\nalloween parties are like sex:\neither a dark, lusty and twisted extravaganza enhanced\nby elaborate costumes; or an\nover-hyped and disappointing\ncharade we do once a year because we feel socially compelled to.

The film\nin question is Zombies of Mass Destruction, a\nsatirical comedy/zombie horror set in the small\nAmerican town of Port Gamble. The main\ncharacters are the token gay couple, the hippie,\nthe god-loving preacher, the fit Iranian girl and\na shit load of wobbling, brain-eating, moaning,\ngroaning Zombies.\nWhen we first meet the Zombies, the thing\nthat comes to mind is \u201cThriller\u201d by Michael\nJackson, then she/it gets pinned to a wall by\nthe gay couple and a fire poker (insert pun\nhere).

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 29 October 2010\n4\nGovernment ministers have confirmed\nthat university tuition fees will be\ncapped in England, meaning that the\ngovernment is rejecting a key element\nof the Browne report.\nThe report, led by Lord Browne, suggested universities should be allowed\nto set their own fees but face a levy\non amounts over \u00a36000. Speaking this\nweek, the universities minister David\nWilletts dismissed Browne\u2019s proposal of\nunlimited fees as \u201cneither sensible nor\nsustainable\u201d.\nMeanwhile, business secretary Vince\nCable said that the government was still\nconsidering its reform of higher education and nothing could be ruled out yet.\nHe did, however, add that \u201cI think that\nparticular approach [of unlimited fees]\nwas one we\u2019re not going to pursue\u201d.\nThis news comes as great relief to students who already face substantial debts\nof over \u00a330,000 upon leaving university.\nIt has been argued that if elite universities charge fees of upwards of \u00a310,000\na year, applications are more likely to\nbe based on financial means rather than\nambition.\nThe Russell Group, representing the\nUK\u2019s top universities, has objected to\nthis latest news. \u201cRowing back from\nBrowne and re-imposing a cap would be\na real waste of an opportunity to allow\nour leading universities to provide the\nhigh quality education that their students\ndeserve,\u201d said Dr Wendy Piatt, the director general.\nThe government is aware that imposing a cap on tuition fees may leave\nuniversities no better off. A minimum\nof \u00a36000 for the cheapest degrees is\nrequired to replace the \u00a32.9 billion cut\nin government funding to universities.\nThey will therefore generate no extra\nincome than before. In order for universities to benefit from a reformed system,\nDavid Willetts has suggested reducing\nthe levy proposed by Browne on fees\nabove \u00a36000: \u201cYou could have a lower\nrate of levy or no levy and that would\nenable universities to hold onto more of\nthe resources that they collect\u201d.\nThe arguments against the proposed\nsteep rate of the levy are reinforced by\ntop universities. An institution seeking to receive \u00a39000 per student would\nhave to charge about \u00a313000. Malcolm\nGrant, of UCL, said it was \u201ca disincentive to invest in the improvements to\nfacilities and staffing support for an excellent student experience that globally\ncompetitive universities simply must\nmake\u201d.\nEvery university is likely to end up\ncharging the maximum tuition fees.\nWhen top-up fees of \u00a33000 were introduced in 2006 we were told a market would be created where competition between universities would drive\ndown the fees. However, only two\nuniversities, Leeds Metropolitan and\nGreenwich),currently charge less than\nthe maximum amount. So when the cap\nis potentially doubled, Browne\u2019s proposal that a market will be established\nis unlikely considering past experience.\nWilletts hopes that measures of fee\nlevels will be put before parliament \u201cbefore Christmas\u201d, in order for changes to\nbe introduced in 2012.\nGovernment rejects\nBrowne Review\nSophia David\nRead this article\nonline at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nIn brief\nRecord number of students miss\nout on university says UCAS\nAfter record numbers of applicants to university this\nyear, figures released by UCAS have shown that a\nstaggering 30.4% of students have not managed to\nsecure a place.\nA total of 688,310 people applied, whereas only\n479,057 have been accepted, leaving 209,253 people who have missed out. Of these, 188,697 were\neligible for clearing but received no offers, 18,081\nhave withdrawn their application, and the final 2,475\napplicants are still waiting for a decision.\nThe increase in demand for places was partly due\nto the recession, with many workers opting to return to education to avoid the job cuts or to improve\nemployability. There were also around 60,000 re-applicants from 2009, which is just under 10% of\ntotal applications, pushing the amount and level of\ncompetition even higher.\nThis \u2018flux\u2019 of application numbers also happened\nin 2005 because of the proposed introduction of top\nup fees in 2006, but the major difference between\nthen and now is that there now exists a government-imposed cap on the number of UK and EU students\na university can take, which was introduced by the\nprevious government in 2008-2009. Universities\nwhich \u2018break\u2019 the cap have to pay a hefty fine of\n\u00a33700 for every student taken over the limit.\nThese recent figures from UCAS will make universities even more cautious with their offers in the\ncoming year, not eager to splash out money on fines\nwhen resources are already stretched, perhaps one\nof many reasons why entrance requirements have\nincreased dramatically for next year. A noticeable example at Imperial is mathematics, which has seen a\nstandard offer of AAA with A\u2019s in all maths modules\ngrow to an offer of A*A*A, within the space of one\nyear.\nThe statistics reflect a growing level of competition\nfor University places, and with the coalition government\u2019s plans to increase the tuition cap or to remove it entirely, and potentially around 190,000 applicants from this year reapplying, next year\u2019s cohort\ncould be in for a particularly rough ride.\nIan Wei\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDr Judit\nNagy\nkilled in\ncar crash\nElection Results\nResults of the Autumn Elections were announced\nahead of the Council debate on Higher Education\nFunding on Monday, though several postgraduate\npositions and the S.H.A.G.

It\u2019s not everyday that you dine in the Knightsbridge area,\nso I made every chance to boast about it!\nHome to Harrods and resident restaurants\nsuch as Zuma, Petrus and Ottolenghi, it is not\nuncommon for students to have the \u2018Look,\nDon\u2019t Touch\u2019 view on eating in Knightsbridge,\napart from say, Wagamama and Yo! Sushi\nalong Brompton Road. Well, fear not, The\nRembrandt answers to the problem of having\na decent lunch without jeopardizing the meagre\nstudent bank balance.\nLocated on the doorstep of the Victoria and\nAlbert Museum, the hotel prides itself on its\nEdwardian style architecture and furnishings,\nin particular the 1606 lounge in which guests,\nlike me, are able to have their G&T before being served in The Palette Restaurant. Of course,\nthere\u2019s plenty more than just gin and tonic on\nthe menu.\nLunch here is a relaxed affair and can be\nserved as a three-course carvery, in which\nguests first help themselves to an overflowing\ncounter of platters that include salmon terrine\nand various cured meats as well as countless\nvegetarian options with grilled aubergines taking my fancy, and other vegetable salads. There\nare usually two meats available for the carvery\non the day, with tender roast beef and a very\nbrilliant pink gammon steak on the day that I\nvisited. The best thing is that what you choose\nto put on the side of your mains is entirely up to\nyou, portion-wise and selection-wise: and with\nthat thought in mind I loaded three Yorkshire\npuddings, slithers of grilled salmon, spinach in\nthe most brilliant form unlike the normal boiled\nLet\u2019s talk about coffee - what else?\ngreens I frequently find myself eating\u2026 and a\ndozen more sides I could bore you to death with\nthe mundane details of. As for the best course\nof the meal, that is, if you aren\u2019t bursting at the\nseams from the two previous ones, is a choice\nof dessert cakes and other miniature fancies.\nOn quieter days, lunch is the more conventional 3 course set menu, with an impressive\narray of choices that changes with seasonal\nproduce. Lunch and dinner is priced at \u00a324.95\nincluding service charge, a steal when you\ncould think about Zuma along the road charging \u00a318.90 for one prawn. I exaggerate not.\nThe Rembrandt also serves as a brilliant choice\nfor evening functions with its location being just\nfive minutes walk from the South Kensington\ncampus and tube station as well as its superb\ndining facilities. Whether it is simply a drinks\nreception, Christmas dinner for the residence\nhalls, or an annual sports club function \u2013 The\nRembrandt has an answer to any Imperial College student\u2019s needs with a special evening function package, prices from \u00a330.00 per person.\nThe Rembrandt, 11 Thurloe Place, Knightsbridge SW7 2RS. 020 7589 8100\nHighly unreflective of The Palette Restaurant, it isn\u2019t normally empty...\nThis Knightsbridge hotel doesn\u2019t do snooty or pretentious\nCharles Betts snubs George Clooney\u2019s Nespresso for coffee at the EEE caf\u00e9\nDark, very intense, balanced, unique, mysteri-ous, delicate and smooth with a strong charac-ter, body and deep sensual aftertaste. Or at least\nthat\u2019s how the ladies in the Nescaf\u00e9 Nespresso\nadverts put it (much to the disdain of George\nClooney). Indeed, not much compares with the\npleasures of an early morning espresso.\nSadly, Taste Imperial generally miss the mark\nwhen it comes to coffee. A good espresso requires employees who are experienced in handling a traditional espresso machine and a ceramic cup. Cardboard, whilst great for people\non the go, will taint and destroy a coffee. Yet\nthe Mechanical Engineering caf\u00e9 doesn\u2019t seem\nto know what a ceramic cup is and the chaps\nin the SCR hate serving coffee in one, sighing\nheavily if you ask for a proper cup. It\u2019s as if you\nhad personally asked them to go to John Lewis,\nbuy a cup, bring it back, wash it, and serve your\ndrink. And the Business School always makes\nthe coffee too strong.\nSurprisingly, then, there is a place on the South\nKensington campus where you can find a decent\ncup of coffee. Laura, Barbara, Paulo and Driss\nof the Electrical Engineering caf\u00e9 are all well\nversed in the subtle art of handling an espresso\nmachine, and manage to consistently make a cup\nof java that\u2019s not too strong or weak and with\njust the right level of bitterness. You get a perfect\ncoffee everytime, served in a posh cup by enthusiastic and cheery staff that take pride in serving\ngood quality beverages to its customers.\nHopefully Taste Imperial learns from this\nbrilliant microcosm of coffee loveliness, and\nimprove the other caf\u00e9s around campus. \u201cWhat\nelse?\u201d as Mr Clooney would say.\n\u201cNot much compares\nwith the pleasures of an\nearly morning espresso\u201d\nThe awesome staff at the EEE caf\u00e9\n\n"

    "content": "31\nfelix FRIDAY 29 FEBRUARY 2010\nFILM\nErin Brockovich, eat your heart out. We\nhave another tough-as-nails, hard-work-ing single mum who is going to court to\nfight an unfair, losing war. This time, it\u2019s\nBetty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank), who\nis determined to put herself through both\ncollege and law school to argue for, and\nhopefully free, her wrongly-convicted\nbrother Kenny (Sam Rockwell). This\nis sibling love at its most powerful. Ms.\nBrockovich was up against a massive,\nevil corporation with Ms. Waters on the\nother hand facing the government and\nits judicial system. Take your pick on\nwhich is more challenging.\nKenny is not a nice guy. He is hot-tem-pered, foul-mouthed and rude, which is\nwhy it\u2019s hard to suspect something shady\nwhen he is pinned for murder and armed\nrobbery. All the evidence is against him,\nand with no plausible alibi, he is sent\nstraight to jail. Rockwell plays this character to perfect precision. He may be\nviolent when under the influence of alco-hol, but he can also be a genuinely nice\nguy as quite clearly shown in the touching scenes he shares with BettyAnne and\nRockwell\u2019s beautifully nuanced performance is undeniably excellent.\nSwank seems to have a knack for\nplaying real-life characters and there is a\ndoes have some help from a fellow\nclassmate, \u201cthe other old lady\u201d, as Abra\n(Minnie Driver) so charmingly puts it.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Abra is so willing to\nhelp \u2013 she is even willing to get up at\nfive in the morning for our heroine \u2013 but\nDriver provides some excellent, comic\nrelief that we don\u2019t mind whenever she\ntags along by Betty Anne\u2019s side, supporting her like all loyal gal-pals should.\nNot much is told about Abra, apart from\nthe fact that she has a heart of gold and a\ncracking sense of humour.\nMany crucial details are rushed past\nfor the sake of pushing on with the core\nplot. Betty Anne\u2019s supposed struggle\nat law school is only very briefly addressed with everything becoming so\nmuch clearer to our heroine in a sudden jump of several years in time. It\nreportedly took the real-life Betty Anne\n18 years to crack the system. The fact\nthat it only takes Swank two hours is\ninevitable, but because the film moves\nso frantically, both backwards and for-wards, some of its focus is lost. Director\nTony Goldwyn tends to use flashbacks\nwhenever he is trying to make more of\nan emotional/dramatic impact on the\nscreen. The problem is, he uses one\nWhile Roberts eats, prays and loves,\nSwank outclasses with Conviction\ntoo many of those, and places them in\nawkward moments. Yes, we understand\nthe fact that Kenny and Betty Anne depended on one another ever since they\nwere young. The child actors (Tobias\nKendall and Bailee Madison) portray\nthis to impressive standards, but do we\nreally need several individual episodes\nthat mirror the various circumstances of\nthe adult siblings?\n\u201cConviction\u201d is your typical, conven-tionally-told autobiography that could\nhave worked just as well as a TV movie.\nBut how does it manage to be so memo-rable? And how does this cheesy story\npack in such a strong emotional punch?\nThe flawless performances. Aside from\nSwank, Rockwell and Driver, the two\nactresses who have very brief moments\nto shine make the most out of their key\nroles. Juliette Lewis, playing a low-life,\nwhite trash with the scariest set of teeth\nis an unforgettable scene-stealer. Melissa Leo\u2019s character, the vengeful cop who\nhas it out for Kenny, remains shockingly\none-dimensional throughout, but Leo\nmanages to bring a touch of humanity\nout of the otherwise unrealistically soulless character.\nNot as courtroom heavy as \u201cErin\nBrockovich\u201d but with as much emotion and a set of actors who have been\nperfectly cast, \u201cConviction\u201d feels manipulative at times, but as the film crescendos to the grand finale, you can\u2019t\nhelp but being swept up by the sustained\ndrama, no matter how predictable.\nreason why she keeps getting these difficult parts: her dramatic performance\ntruly draws the audience in. Looking\nmore seasoned and modest than Julia\nRoberts ever did in Brockovich, Swank,\nat the heart of the story, instantly wins\nthe audience over to her side, and her\nmagnetic performance makes us cry\nwhenever she does.\nDespite the growing tension in her\nmarriage and the difficulty she faces\nwhilst balancing law books, a part-time\njob and raising her two children, it\u2019s her\ndetermination that gets her through.

Apple announced two new models:\na thinner successor to the 13.3\u201d version\nand a brand new 11.6\u201d notebook.\nThe MacBook Air is now even more\nknife-thin at 17mm at its thickest edge,\ntapering down to an minute 2.8mm.\nThe 13\u201d model also sheds a little\nfat, bringing it down\nW\nikileaks is in the\nnews again this\nweek after releasing approximately\n400,000 formerly\nclassified documents relating to the war\nin Iraq.\nThe biggest revelation from the document dump is the fact that the American\ngovernment has seemingly admitted to\nfar fewer civilian casualties than they\nactually knew about, and looked away\nfrom torture they knew the Iraqi army\nwas committing. The document release will come at a welcome time for\nWikiLeaks, as it will likely help divert\nattention away from their other prob-lems.\nCurrently WikiLeaks is suffering from\nissues regarding its finances, and the\nlegal problems relating to the sexual assault allegations recently levied against\nJulian Assange, the public face of the\nLess Air. More lust\nChris Fonseka\nAmerican embarrasment as more\ndocuments leaked about Iraq war\nFrom sexual assault to frozen funds, WikiLeaks is under attack from all sides, but\nwill the whistleblower\u2019s friend survive? Feroz Salam continues his investigation\nMiles away from the cringe-worthy\nlaunch of Windows 7, almost exactly\na year ago to this day, Microsoft have\nkick-started or \u2018rebooted\u2019 their vision\nof an operating system for the modern\nsmartphone. The developers say they\nare \u201cproud\u201d of what they\u2019ve achieved\nand so they should be \u2013 it\u2019s not often that\na new Microsoft product opens to such a\npositive reception.\nQuite a few new Windows Phone 7\ndevices were launched at an event in\nLondon, including models from HTC,\nLG, Dell and Samsung, with two currently available for purchase in the UK\n\u2013 including the impressive HTC HD7 on\nO2 (shown right).\nMuch consideration has been given\nto the graphical user interface in WP7,\nand this gives the new phone OS a\nclean, crisp feeling. It\u2019s almost like\nthey\u2019ve taken the best features of the\niPhone (swiping, pinch-to-zoom and\nother multi-touch gestures), and mixed\nthem with their own ideas (moving\nbackgrounds, colourful menus, infinite\nscroll), to make something greater than\nthe sum of the two.\nWindows Phone 7 lands in the UK\nJake Lea-Wilson to 1.32kg, while the new 11.6\u201d model\nweighs in at just 1.06kg.\nThe biggest developments however,\nare in the internals. Both models feature\na low-voltage version of the Core2Duo\nprocessor, coupled with a decent battery,\nproposing seven hours of usable life. In\nthe interest of shrinking the design as\nmuch as physically possible, Apple has\nabandoned off-the-shelf components\nand opted for a custom flash-based SSD\nstorage system, similar to that used in the\niPad, iPhone and iPod touch. While this\nallows for much faster memory access\nand near instant-on boot up, it brings the\nprice to \u00a3849 for the base model 11.6\u201d,\nwhich is still cheaper than the starting\nprice of the previous iteration.\nThere is no doubt that the MacBook\nAir is a lust-inducing laptop, the question is: will this be a hit with the\ngeneral public? Or will it suffer the\nsame fate as the last Air, simply to\nbe used to help Senior Managers\nshow off?\nwebsite.\nAs various mainstream news outlets\npore over the documents published in\nthe latest leak, Wikileaks itself has quite\na task on its hands in trying to release\nfunding, which has been frozen the\nlast two weeks, since its account held\nwith an Internet payment company was\nclosed down. This appears to be a direct result of Wikileaks recently having\nbeen placed on a blacklist of organisations maintained by the Australian and\nAmerican governments, and makes it\nunlikely that many other popular Internet payment services will want to\ndeal with them in the near future. This\nwill cause some serious issues for\nWikiLeaks\u2019 progress, but a quick look\nat the website shows that you can still\ndonate to fund their operations. It\u2019s\nunclear however, whether they will\never be able to access funds from the\nblocked account.\nThe funding problem seems to match\nthe regular escalation of issues that occurs every time WikiLeaks is poised to\nrelease a large amount of data to the\npress, and now comes off the back of\nallegations of sexual harassment levied\nagainst Assange in Sweden.\nThe investigation has taken some puzzling twists and turns \u2013 starting off as a\nrape and sexual assault case, before being hurriedly downgraded less than 24\nhours later to a harassment investiga-tion.\nAfter eight weeks of relatively little\nnews about the investigation, Swedish prosecutors are yet to formally file\na case based on it. This has lent some\ncredibility to Assange\u2019s claims that he\nis the victim of a particularly callous\nsmear campaign. Assange is understandably refusing to discuss the matter with the press, storming out of an\ninterview on CNN recently as the interviewer attempted to press him into discussing the implications of the charges\non Wikileaks.\nWhen I wrote about Wikileaks for\nFelix last year, I ended my article with\na grim prediction \u2013 that it would take a\nlot for them to stay in business for any\nsizeable amount of time, considering the\nwide range of governments they seem to\nhave upset.\nRoughly six months on and a fair few\nscoops later, they are still hanging on in\nthere, but the question marks over the\nfuture of their organisation remain just\nas prominent.\nWith the curious rape allegations, it\nlooks as if Assange might be up against\npeople who are willing to stoop to remarkable lows in an attempt to keep\nhim under control, and only time will\ntell whether his resourcefulness will be\nable to keep Wikileaks (and himself) in\nsafe hands.\nThe default apps have been designed\nby designers and not just developers,\ngiving a new element of style, rather\nthan just functionality. The main empha-sis, however, seems to be on integration\nand this is, frankly, fantastic. Finally\nMicrosoft have understood that they are\nnot just making firmware for generic,\nfaceless office workers \u2013 they\u2019re making it for social animals, for people with\ncharacter. Right on the home screen,\nyou can see posts from Twitter, Facebook, messages, calls and any other information apps decide to give you.\nBut what\u2019s miss-ing? Inevitably\nthere are shortfalls in the system and surprise\nsurprise, they\u2019ve\ndecided not to include Flash, not to\nmention copy and\npaste. Furthermore\nthere\u2019s no HTML5,\nwhich is supposed\nto be the future\nof the Internet, so\nthere may be trouble looming.\nWhat does this mean for the mobile\nphone space though? Is Microsoft just\nentering a crowded market place, or is\nit pushing the boundaries of mobile\ndevices further? Now with Android,\nBlackBerry OS, iOS and Windows\nPhone 7, consumers have never had\nmore choice, and better quality. Even\nthe self-proclaimed \u201cdork-talk\u201d man\nhimself, Stephen Fry, is a convert.\nSurely his endorsement can only mean\ngood things for Microsoft\u2019s newest mobile OS.\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX\nFriday 29 October 2010\n16\nPolitics Editors: Hassan Joudi, Rory Fenton\nJames Lees, Rajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDebate whether Lib D\nThe Lib Dems put their country before\nparty politics, believes Hassan Joudi\nThe accusations that the Liberal Democrats have\ncompromised or \u201cbetrayed\u201d their principles has\nconstantly been levelled at them since their rise to\nshared power in May 2010. These have only intensified with the recent comprehensive spending\nreview and the announcement of a higher cap on\nuniversity tuition fees. But is it fair to judge them\nso harshly?\nThe Liberal Democrats have found themselves\nin a very unique situation. The wrangling and\nnegotiations between British political parties has\nnot been seen since 1940, when the pressures of\nWorld War II forged the last coalition government\nled by Winston Churchill. Thus few people in living memory have experienced a British coalition\ngovernment, certainly none of the middle-aged\npoliticians in the Conservative or Lib Dem parties\ntasked with forming it.\nTo emphasise this uniqueness, in May 2010, on\nthe day David Cameron was finally ushered in to\nNumber 10, Nick Robinson, the BBC Political Editor sighed in front of the camera as he presented\nBBC News live and said he\u2019d simply \u201crun out of\nsuperlatives\u201d to describe the day\u2019s events in London.\nBefore the election none of the political parties\nseemed to consider too seriously the possibility\nthey would be working alongside one another to\nrun the country. Campaigners employed na\u00efve\nelection tactics like demonising the enemy and\neagerly signing pledges, the most high-profile of\nwhich is the Liberal Democrats \u201cpromising to vote\nagainst any increase in tuition fees\u201d at an NUS\nevent.\nBut no one has the benefit of hindsight and it\u2019s\nobvious this pledge has put them between a rock\nand a hard place. However it is rash to roll out pre-election examples like this in order to accuse the\nLib Dems of \u201cselling out\u201d because no one could\nforesee how the election results and negotiations\nwould play out in the coming weeks. Few people\nthink the Lib Dems intentionally made that promise with malice, intending to break it once they\nwere in power with the Conservatives. They have\nnow matured as a party, gained experience of coalition politics and know better next time not to\nmake such promises.\nThe issue of pre-election and post-election\nmindsets is intriguingly wider than this. Before\nthe election, everyone was clamouring for change,\nprobably greatly influenced by the 2008 Obamamania across the Atlantic with his five-word slogan \u201cChange we can believe in.\u201d Britons wanted\nsomething different from 13 years of Labour gov-ernment, we were told. The expenses scandal was\nstill fresh with the electorate.\nThat is what the Conservative Party slogan \u201cVote\nfor Change\u201d appealed to. The Lib Dem slogan\nproclaimed \u201cChange that works for you, building\na fairer Britain\u201d, and Nick Clegg\u2019s appeal to the\nBritish populace at the end of the first televised\ndebate was to \u201ctry something different.\u201d\nWell now we\u2019ve got change! An unprecedented\noccurrence in British politics! Three-party politics is here and the \u2018blue vs red\u2019 regime is gone.\nBut complaints flew in left, right and centre. \u201cEverything is so different!\u201d or \u201cThe Lib Dems have\nbetrayed us! Sold out!\u201d were some of the typical\ncomments blaring out on the airwaves in radio\ndebates or filling the inches of newspaper opinion\ncolumns. Complaining it seems is a favourite past\ntime for many observers.\nTo those who argue the Lib Dems got the worse\nend of the deal, it is wise to remember that Britain operates a representative democracy system.\nTo summarise this in one sentence: we the people\nvote for our representatives in parliament which is\nthe body with most direct influence on our government\u2019s policy. Thus if your political party doesn\u2019t\nget enough votes, it has less of a right to influence\ngovernment policy. Be that outside the government as a party in opposition, or inside the government as a partner in coalition.\nThe Conservative and Lib Dems parties were\nnever on equal footings. The former received 1.5\ntimes more of the votes cast (10.7m to 6.8m), and\nowing to the First Past The Post (FPTP) system\n5.4 times more seats in the House of Commons\n(307 to 57). And this difference is duly reflected in\nthe 8-page Coalition Negotiations document they\npublished on 11 May 2010.\nManifestos have been chopped and spliced, and\nunderstandably Britons are not used to this. Capital Gains Tax was the first issue to crop up in June\n2010, with Conservatives giving way to Lib Dem\nmanifesto policy, and the pupil premium is another\nrecent example. The Lib Dems have in turn acknowledged that coalition government policy takes\npriority over their party manifesto policy in a plethora of other areas, most painfully on tuition fees.\nSuch issues are at the essence of coalition government politics. Which do you put first, your party or your government? To use a crude sporting example it is like a football player torn between club\nand country match commitments. Because few of\nus in living memory remember a British coalition,\nit may seem an extraordinary or a special situa-tion. But take a simple glance at other nation states\nwith frequent coalition governments, and it soon\nbecomes apparent that our club and country analogy is very common. It is not fair to criticise the\nLib Dems for often choosing their country. Soon\nwe Britons won\u2019t be so surprised when similar issues arise again in future.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nIran\nIndonesia\u2019s Mount Merapi has erupted, killing at\nleast 25 people and prompting thousands to flee\nthe local area. This eruption comes after a tsunami\nstruck the Mentawai Islands following a magnitude\n7.7 quake leaving at least 100 people dead. An area\n10km around the volcano has been declared a danger zone and residents have been ordered to evacu-ate. Many residents however, refuse to leave their\nproperty and livestock behind, in case of a false\nalarm. Mount Merapi is Indonesia\u2019s most active vol-cano, erupting most recently in 2006 in an eruption\nwhich killed 2 people. Indonesia is located on the\nPacific Ring of Fire which is one of the most geologically active areas on Earth.\nIndonesia\nIran has begun loading fuel into its Bushehr\nreactor according to the Iranian state media. 163\nfuel rods will be loaded into the reactor which is\nexpected to start generating electricity in 2011.\nFuel for the reactor will be provided by Russia,\nwhich will also receive the spent fuel rods from\nthe Bushehr reactor, reducing the chance of\nproliferation. This marks a milestone in Iran\u2019s\ncivilian nuclear programme which was hampered\nby UN sanctions and there are suspicions that\nWashington has\nagreed to the\nfuelling of the\nBushehr reactor in\nreturn for Russian\nsupport for more\nsanctions against\nIran.\nCuba\nCubans have begun queuing outside Government\noffices to apply for business permits following economic reforms on the island. Cubans will be allowed\nto apply for self-employment licenses for 178 job\nclasses including taxi driver, restaurateur and elec-tricians. Cuban will also be allowed to hire staff\nother than relatives in 83 of the approved job classes for the first time since 1968 when small businesses were nationalised. The Cuban Government\nhave also introduced income tax on the island for incomes of over 5,000 pesos (\u00a3142) and hope these\nreforms will improve the Cuban economy which is in\nthe midst of a severe crisis.\nDo the Lib Dems need to regrow support fro\n\u201cFew people think the Lib\nDems intentionally made\nthat promise with malice\u201d\nHave the Liberal Democrats lost their way o\n\u201cWhich do you put\nfirst: your party or your\ngovernment?\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "18\nCOM M ENT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 29 OCTOBER 2010\nI\nt was a very ordinary day when I\nrealised I was a superhero.\nI was walking through Hyde\nPark with nowhere in particular to be. As I was by myself, I\ngranted my tongue the freedom to do\nas it wished. It entertained itself with a\ndelightful series of clicks and clucks as\nI walked.\nI stopped \u2013 I had company. There was\na squirrel in my path, watching me ex-pectantly. My tongue\u2019s merry rhythm\ncontinued, unaware of its audience. My\nsciurine friend began to dance about me\nin rapture because of my lingual acro-batics. I then realised the power I held\nover squirrel-kind. It is my gift and my\ncurse. Who am I? I am\u2026the Squirreler!\nAhem.\nThe reason I am not currently cavorting about the Royal Parks in my underpants is that, as a super-power, communicating to squirrels is over-rated.\nAll they ever talk about are acorns of\ninterest. That, and whether peanuts are\nnuts or not. (To any squirrels reading\nthis: they\u2019re legumes \u2013 deal with it!).\nNo, global conquest will not come in\nsquirrel-form.\nBut watch out for the pigeons. Squirrels are very obvious. When you see a\nsquirrel, you remember the encounter,\nperhaps even using it as a talking piece\non social occasions if you happen to be\nthat conversationally challenged. Conversely, when did you last see a pigeon?\nCan\u2019t remember? Of course not; they\nbarely flicker on your perceptual regis-ters. And why would they? Pigeons are\njust so commonplace.\nBeing hidden in plain sight allows pigeons greater room for manoeuvre. Are\nthose in Trafalgar Square milling about\nor are they reconnoitering the strategic\nentries and exits into key tactical loca-tions? Are those flocking about Big Ben\ntrying to roost or are they clocking the\nsecurity shift changes at Westminster.\nWhat better cover is there than being too\ninnocuous for suspicion?\nWhat\u2019s really worrying is that the leaders of this pigeon army may not just be\namong us \u2013 we might be training them!\nExhibition Road is a geat academic and\ncultural hotspot and plenty of pigeons\ncall it home. With so much information passing back and forth, a pigeon\ncould eavesdrop all it needs to know in\nno time. After all, who would consider\ncensoring themselves because of a mere\npigeon? How many times have you seen\na pigeon flying about in the SAF build-ing? It\u2019s there for a reason.\nYou might scoff at this and say that\nthe average pigeon is no smarter than a\nscatter-brained squirrel. This is a mistake you make at your peril \u2013 never underestimate your enemy. B. F. Skinner\ndemonstrated that pigeons show an uncanny capacity for operant conditioning.\nThrough trial and error, they can quickly\nlearn and adapt to their environment.\nPigeons of prey\nThus, they can take the fight anywhere\nwithout going on the back-talon. The\nSAS, the Taliban? Amateurs compared\nto a pigeon with a grudge.\nThere are 7.5 million people in London. Do you know how many pigeons\nthere are? No? Neither do I. No-one has\nan accurate grasp of their numbers. How\ncan we develop counter-strategies when\nwe lack such basic intelligence? We are\nwoefully under-prepared for a pigeon insurgency \u2013 a certain leaked government\ndossier indicates that London could be\nburied under their guano in as little as\nforty-five minutes.\nThe big question surrounding this\ncolumbine coup for total domination is\nnot \u201cif\u2026\u201d but \u201cwhen...\u201d We are living\non borrowed time. If we don\u2019t do something soon, it will be too late. There is\none thing I know for certain.\nWe won\u2019t be getting any help from the\nsquirrels.\nThe next threat to British security could be coming from\ncloser to home than you think...\nImperial is proud of referring to itself as the\nuniversity of the future. After all, few universities can boast graduates who predicted\nthe 20th Century as keenly as H.G. Wells\nor who contributed to our advancement\nthroughout it as significantly as Alexander\nFleming, Dennis Gabor or James Ellis. It is\ntherefore deeply disappointing that a university so keen to promote technical innovation\nin all fields should be neglecting an area\nmuch closer to home.\nOne of the most tired and overused clich-es that new Imperial students are exposed\nto is that their departments do not care\nabout them. Their priority, we have all been\ntold, is to perform cutting-edge research.\nStudents can come to the lectures, pick up\nthe handouts, attend one or two tutorials\nand then find themselves shoved into the\nexamination room. If they somehow manage\nto come out of the process with a high-qual-ity degree, the system will suck them into a\nresearch position and force the next year\u2019s\nintake to run the same gauntlet.\nWhile the truth may be nowhere near this\nbleak, students are given little reason to\ndoubt the received wisdom. Teaching methods in most departments have changed little since they first opened, whereas the capacity for innovation has increased beyond\nmeasure.\nWe need look no further than our own\nMathematics Department for proof of this.\nProfessor Richard Thomas is embracing\nmodern technology, not simply for the sake\nof it, but as an effective tool to improve\nlearning and understanding. His students\nare full of praise for his techniques; again\nand again they say that the mobile app approach is helping them engage with the\ncontent instead of simply skimming through\nlectures, mindlessly scribbling down notes.\nOne would be tempted to ask \u201cWhat\u2019s\ntaken so long?\u201d if the answer weren\u2019t so ob-vious. There is a lack of ambition and creativity when it comes to teaching at Imperial.\nAnd innovation is often not taken seriously,\nas Professor Thomas knows all too well.\nThe College believes that it can retain its\nreputation through high quality research\nand ruthlessly high entry standards. It\ndoesn\u2019t hold itself to the same standard of\nexcellence and innovation in teaching as it\ndoes in research, and it thinks that this has\nlittle effect on its image. The pitifully poor\nlevel of donations from Alumni is sure proof\nof their folly. Had H.G. Wells been told, over\na century ago, that blackboards and chalk\nwould still be used in today\u2019s lecture theatres \u2013 would he not be disappointed?\nFELIX\nRhys Davies\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nImperial is woefully\nunambitious when it\ncomes to teaching\nThought the biggest threat to Britain was from human terrorists? Think again\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cWe\u2019re living on\nborrowed time. If we\ndon\u2019t do something, it\nwill be too late\u201d\n\u201c\u201d\nA leaked government dossier\nindicates that London could\nbe buried under their guano in\nforty-five minutes.\nC omment Editor: Anna Perman\nIllustration by Mitesh Patel\n\n"

Likewise\nwith skydiving, hitchhiking, sandboarding,\nanything involving overdoses of adrenaline \u2013\nthrill-seeking essentially provides me with the\nmotivation to un-hang my rucksack and trot.\nWhich isn\u2019t that dissimilar to other travellers\nout there.\nThe evidence lies with the positive feedback\nthe \u2018fear\u2019 tourism industry has been enjoying\nfor the past decade: with ever-increasing num\u201cThe \u2018danger biz\u2019 works because it allows people to\npush their limits and conquer their worst fears\u201d\nHow far will the tourism industry go to empty our bowels\nand our coffers asks Dylan Lowe\nminutive, yet distinguishable.\nYet, we still jump for things for that extra\nkick of excitement.\nThe \u2018danger biz\u2019 works and receives popular acclaim because it allows people to stretch\ntheir limits \u2013 limits often imposed upon them\nin normal-day lives of which travelling is a\nop as, unlike the horror-movie industry, sparks\nof imagination and innovation are in no short\nsupplies. Nor are would-be entrepreneurs. Are\nwe descending from the status of holidaying\nadrenaline-junkies to that of voluntary lem-mings? I certainly hope not.\nWhat is certain is that our society wouldn\u2019t\nbeg to have all the action rebuked and condemned like a Class-A drug. The element of\nthrill-seeking is too firmly incorporated into\nour nature as humans \u2013 it\u2019ll continue to urge\nus to discover new ways to test our capacity\nfor danger.\nIn the meantime I\u2019ll stick to what is already\navailable \u2013 mind you, the \u2018already-availabilities\u2019 still translates as an endless list of oppor-tunities, enough to shower me with adrenaline\nfor a lifetime.\nbers of adrenaline-junkies looming from the\nhorizon the market is expanding at an unprecedented rate, giving rise to popular adventure\ndestinations like New Zealand and Namibia as\nwell as new inventive ways to entertain oneself\nwhile on the very brink of death.\nAnd, whilst I may bemoan about how squeamish the modern-day tourist has become, given\nthe right circumstances and safety procedures\nthe holiday-makers and vagabonds can display\nsome admirable boldness.\nBut then, the whole point of danger-lusting is\nthat it\u2019s not entirely safe \u2013 one may even take\nrisks for granted.\nUrban legend has it that, while the jet boat\nhe was on was speeding through a crevice, a\nJapanese tourist disregarded instructions to remain seated and \u2013 rather predictably \u2013 stood\nup to take a shot at photographic perfection.\nHorror ensued when the remaining passengers\nwere splattered with crimson and found a decapitated body in their midst.\nAnother equally as far-fetched, yet frighteningly practical, story depicts a female bungy-jumper slipping out of her harness mid-freefall\nand tumbled, concluding her near-death experience with a few excruciating breakages.\nAnd I\u2019ve recently been told that doctors have\na way of identifying bungy jumpers by looking at an X-ray of their spine \u2013 the recoil could\nleave behind a signature dislocation that is di-liberation \u2013 in the somewhat-full-but-not-quite\nknowledge that their wellbeing is safeguarded\nby regulations and constraints. And much to\nthe delight of post-activity \u2018phobes\u2019, they find\nthemselves having conquered their worst fears.\nDespite the sequential warnings the Jaws\nseries has beseeched its audience, despite the\nnumber of swimmers and surfers recovered\nfrom beaches mauled and dismembered, shark\ncage diving remains a hit because of the metal\nbars which separated spectator and beast \u2013 by\nall means still an alarmingly close encounter\nwith the infamous big-whites.\nThough how far will our affinity for \u2018fear factor\u2019 stretch?

To virtual novices, this is practically\nsuicide.\nAnd with characters like Dean Potter continuing to put their lives at risk to achieve nail-biting yet awesome feats, little wonder that the\ngeneral public would seek to mimic them.\nI cannot predict how the industry will devel-Yup, this is what you think it is \u2013 bungy jumping from a helicopter\nDean Potter highlining in Yosemite\n\n"

Friday marked the beginning\nof the BUCS annual surfing championships\n\u2013 the biggest surfing competition in Europe \u2013\nand we had four surfers ready to do it justice.\nThe long minibus journey was soon forgotten\nas we jumped in the sea to catch some waves\nand get some practice in before the first heats\nthe following day. After showers and sup-per, drinking ensued, but the four entering the\ncompetition (Will Hunt, Elliot Taylor, Adam\n\u2018Hardcore\u2019 Harvey and Dario Mazza) packed\nin early to get some sleep before the big day.\nThe rest of us (supporters and reserves) decided the night was still young and headed to the\ncampsite bar. A few pints later, the Sambuca\nshots were on. Unfortunately, Serkan \u2018Duncan\u2019 Karaagac couldn\u2019t handle this and opted\nfor a safe vodka and coke, prompting Thom to\nempty all the shots into his glass. Serkan was\nobliged to Down It, and imminently became\nthe first casualty of the weekend. Luckily he\nwasn\u2019t wearing his \u2018pulling shirt\u2019.\nThe next day, the competition started at 9am\nand we only just made it in time. Our surfers were in the first heats, and we\u2019d been misinformed about the start time! We arrived at\nFistral Beach to final calls for Elliot, so some\nsuper-quick wetsuit changes were required.\nFortunately, our surfers held their nerve and\npulled off some very respectable surfing. They\nhad 15 minutes to impress the judges; each\nwave they caught was marked out of 10, and\ntheir two best wave scores were added together\nto give a final mark out of 20. The two best\nsurfers in each heat went through to the next\nround. Unfortunately, none of our team got\nthrough, despite their best efforts. Frustratingly, Will and Elliot were both third in their heats,\nso came very close. The competition was fierce\n(it is a national contest) and they didn\u2019t get a\nwarm-up, so for a first attempt we were not\ndisappointed with the result. With the pressure\noff, we retired to the other end of the beach and\nhad an enjoyable afternoon\u2019s surfing, followed\nby complementary massages provided by the\ncompetition organisers.\nThe upside of not getting through to the next\nround was that no one had to worry about getting a good night\u2019s sleep that evening, so we\ncould all enjoy the nightlife in Newquay. Our\nstomachs lined with spagbol and Doritos, we\nbegan a customary game of Ring of Fire. After\nround 2, we stumbled to the camp entrance to\ncatch the last student-packed shuttle bus into\nNewquay town. The official party was in Sailors Club with Nero headlining, so we followed\nthe crowd there. Needless to say, the rest of\nthe evening was a glorious haze of dubstep and\ndrinking.\nThe effects of the previous night did not hamper Saturday\u2019s surfing potential, with a morning trip to a beach we call \u2018Thom\u2019s Secret Spot\u2019\nand an afternoon surf at Watergate beach, all\naccompanied by perfect sunshine. The evening\nled to some unequal and controversial pizza\ncutting, and more alcohol consumption, with\nsome vicious variations on the game Spoons\nand obligatory fines, including one for Serkan\u2019s\npick-up line \u2018it\u2019s illegal to have an ass like that\u2019\nthe previous evening. The night took us to the\nclub at the campsite, and on our return, culminated in setting the fire alarm off cooking garlic bread, decorating an unconscious Adam and\nSerkan with socks, and discovering someone\u2019s\nregurgitated supper in the sink.\nThe next morning, Dario owned up to the\nmess in the sink, and we missed our checkout\ntime by two hours. Slightly jaded, we packed\nup and made for Fistral beach to watch the finals of the competition. The waves were tiny,\nbut the finalists still managed to pull off some\ninspiring moves. After the presentation, we\nstopped off at a pub for a much-needed Sunday\nroast before returning to London. All in all, it\nwas an amazing few days, and we\u2019ll definitely\nbe back next year to build on this year\u2019s result.\nIC Surfers head to the\nwarm beaches of Newquay\nfor BUCS Championships\nSuns out , guns out.

He had a wide range\nof interests from a fascination with Mickey Mouse\nto an unlikely soft spot for Cher.

Leading us through Dirac\u2019s life from his strict\nand protected childhood which he came to resent,\nthrough to his glory days of achievement and then\nhis later days where he struggled with the pace\nof new physics.

Professor\nThomas writes out a rather complicated looking question for the students, which means\nnothing to me but looks impressive. The students seem to know what it means though,\nwhich is good! These examples are not prepared in advance: Professor Thomas just\nwrites down questions \u201con a whim\u201d and gives\nmultiple choice answers.\nOn the screen in front of me I am given a\nlist of different options. Each member of the\nclass then chooses which option they think\nis correct and \u2018vote\u2019 by \u2018pressing\u2019 the button\nnext to their option. I decline from voting and\nlet the person sitting next to me vote in my\nplace. After a short delay a simple bar graph\ndepicting the lecture hall\u2019s answers pops up in\nfront of me of the screen. It\u2019s very basic but\neffective. When I ask Professor Thomas about\nthis straightforward process he says that something \u201cas simple as possible meant that [he]\ncan use it at the same time as writing on board\nor visualise without disrupting the lesson.\u201d\nProfessor Thomas believes that the use of\nthis technology wakes up the students in the\nroom. It \u201cdisrupts the \u2018copy down lecture\nnotes\u2019 mentality and has [the students] think\nhard for a minute about something.\u201d I can see\nfrom the undergraduates sitting around me\nthat this method provokes discussion and also\ninduces a competitiveness to get the answer\nright. But for the shyer members of the class,\nit allows them to contribute without having all\neyes on them. Professor Thomas explained,\n\u201c[I] can use one example to illustrate a whole\npiece of theory, and be sure [the students] really thought about it because they answered a\nquestion on it.\u201d\nThis interactivity is not new: the class had\npreviously used physical \u2018clickers\u2019. It had\nhowever turned out to be a logistical nightmare and so the use of devices that the majority of the students already carry round with\nthem seemed like a logical step.\nAlthough I am no expert in education practices and theories, the ability to actually experiment and test ideas just learnt in reality surely\nmust provide each student with immediate\nfeedback about how well they have picked up\nwhat is being taught. Interaction may be beneficial but when there are over 200 students in\na lecture, it turns into a challenge.\nIn the maths department, Professor Thomas\nis the only lecturer to be currently using the\nonline technology and I believe it is no coincidence that he is one of the younger members of Imperial\u2019s faculty. Professor Thomas\nassures me that his efforts are being closely\nwatched. Some others may soon follow but\nothers remaining dead against it. He explains\nthat there is the occasional playful joke by other members of the faculty, teasing him about\nthe technology use, but most of the faculty are\nvery supportive.\nTechnology now invades every single place\nin our lives and has revolutionised society. Although thus far technology in education has\nlagged behind the rest of society, surely it is\nonly a matter of time before it fully invades?\nThe fact that the internet is now portable gives\nus the ability to access our digital world and\nintegrate it with our physical one. It seems\nprudent for Imperial, as one of the UK\u2019s leading universities, to start integrating it now and\nlead the way.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically one big experiment at the moment,\u201d Professor Thomas said. What is the future for Imperial? It\u2019s a tricky one. Although\nthe influx of technology into teaching seems\nboth inevitable and positive, have a one size\nfits all approach may actually be detrimental.\nEach lecturer is unique in the methods they\nemploy and style of teaching. The ultimate\nquestion therefore is what method should Imperial adopt to being greater technology integration into the classroom?\n\u201cOf course [other technologies] get forced\non us all the time, and various people have\nvarious incentives to get us to use as many\nas possible as soon as possible. But usually\nthey\u2019re not ready for easy robust use,\u201d Professor Thomas explains, \u201cIf they\u2019re good and\neasy to use then we\u2019d use them. The problem\nis that education seems not to be a big enough\nmarket for them to get developed properly.\nSo they\u2019re often clunky/unusable/etc. It\u2019s\nonly when business or ordinary people have a\nuse for something that it gets developed well\nenough to be useful.\u201d\nInteractive technology is widespread at Imperial. The old style clickers that Professor\nThomas used to use are in use amongst a large\nnumber of departments. John Conway, senior\nlearning technologist at Imperial says that researchers are getting excited about using different types of technology more. In fact, he\nhas heard that the Business School are interested in developing an iPhone app!\nThere are, however, many considerations\nthat need to be made when trying to introduce\nthese technologies. For example, what kind of\ndevices can access it, and what ICT support\nis needed. Mr Conway says that pilot studies\nneed to be done to tease out these problems\nearly on but that there is much promise. He\nalso commented that in the economic times\nwhere more people are vying for a smaller\nfunding pot, it will be interesting to see how\nuse of more technology in education could\nhelp improve financial efficiency without\njeopardising quality.\nBack in the Clore Lecture Hall, the lecture\ndraws to a close. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t\npicked up any more mathematical knowl-edge, but I am excited about this development\nwhich is encompassing modern technology. I\nask some students around me who had been\nvoting what they think of the \u2018voting system\u2019. \u201cIt gives us a break and time to think,\u201d\nsays one. Others explain that it gives them\na chance to check they understand everything as they go along, both things Professor\nThomas is aiming to achieve! The consensus\nis that it\u2019s definitely a good thing, and it will\nbe interesting to see if the rest of the Maths\nDepartment and even other faculties will develop their own version.\nDespite teasing from his\ncolleagues, Professor Richard\nThomas is embracing new\ntechnologies to help engage with\nstudents.
