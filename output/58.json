    "content": "' 1\nPROFiLE O.CK ALE In the past it has been customary to profile the\nRetiring Editors of Felix; however, recently the Editors\nhave proved to be 'retiring' in more than one sense, so\nit is with great pleasure we enclose this Profile of our\npresent Editor Emeritus, Mr. D.C. Kale.\nDinesh Chintaman Kale was brought up and received\nhis early education in Poona,' (yes, really-) His education there proceeded to the point where he received his8. So. (Poona) in Chemistry. Since then he has slightly changed his interests, so when he came to England in3 \u00abp tomb er,'52, it was to enter the R.S. M. as a Fresher.\nAlthough concerned with finding his feet in a strange fie cm try and getting to grips with Mining Subjects,\n.he found plenty of time for Union activities. He played\ni Hockey and Boxed (once) for the R.S. M.( mainly to get them?\npoints, he says). He Joined FELIX in his first term and\nworked up to Editor, which post he took over in May '53 -i this still surprises him since it was only his first year:\nat I.C. to other achievement in his first year with which he\nwas quite pleased was that he learned to dance and has\nsince settled down to a steady I.C. Hop standard - which\nhe doesn't want to ha prove. An incidental fact about\nhis first year at I.C. is that he got through his First Mining Es^m. In Oct >55 he entered 1.0. 004 Hostel, ana is st*A., in residence there on the top floor. It is generally\n- It that he has added even more distinction to that\ngust body of Hostel lte s, who have re christened hi\u00bb\nDanny'.\nThe first month of the present Session was spent in getting Felix back on to its fe pt again after the long\nVacation. He was so successful with this that he had to spend the second month of the Session resting, and then\nthe vacation working.'\nHe still plays Hockey; and recently he has helped\nto start the newly formed International Relations Club.\nIn cora non with most busy people Dinesh proved very\nreticent, when asked exactly what he does with his spars\ntime.\nHis particular likes include, Hops, Peter Cheyney,\nBeethoven^ Shocolate and Jung. His dislikes, Mathemati cs, modern composers, tobacco and Shopping.\nFraa the point of view of an Indian in England\nhe flays that he finds the climate warmer than ha\nexpected, that English people talk more than he expected,\nand that he certainly does more work than he expected.\nDuring vacations he ha3 worked in Scotland and\nWales; he likes Scotsmen better than Englishman, and\nhas no comment on Welshmen.\nTECHNICAL TRENDS CAVING IN KENSINGTON In view of the porous nature of the terrain tn South Kensington and the neighbourhood, it is not sur pris in a that a considerable number of caverns, rot boles, often of large size, are to be\nfound .\nWith a view to classifying thera and describing their great beauties ana wonders a hardy group of s pele o logi sts have recently explored their ramifications and here publish their report. I. The Long Whits Echoing Cavern This beautiful cavern is one of the easiest of access, either by the northern or southern mouths or by a pothole a short distance from the southern end. This cavern Is very nearly straight and, of those accessible on foot, one of the longest. Its walls are covered with a clear, white glaze probably of, rock salt. Originally this must have been very dazzling, but its full glories have been irreparably lost due to tourists who have written inscriptions on\nthe walls. The dust stirred by these aforesaid tourists has dimmed the glory and full intricacies of the vaulted roof and makes them difficult to decipher. For those who have an interest in geology some remarkably horizontal strata may be\nobserved through the white glaze. A short side tunnel has been made so that visitors to the Victoria and Albert Museum can\nreadily see this natural beauty. Due to the glazed surface a fine e oho exists in the cavern. For this reason visitors are not'\nallowed to take their dogs inside as the sudden-mess and power of the echo of their barks would cause them ( the dogs) to lose their reason( if any). The origin of this masterpiece of natural sculpture is a mystery. Some suggest that it is part of an underground river bed and to farther \u2022 their case point out that in wet weather water,' sometimes shows near the tortuous southern entrance and northern portal. The presence of th\u00bb\nglass a and the peculiar nature of the rook make\nth if lta pro hab ii L.II. The Black Bole The nearest entrance to this complicated maze\nadjoins the southern portals of the Long White 'Echoing Cavern. This is probably the most popular of the local caverns; in fact it is so popular that a railway has been installed to cope with. the number of visitors. In an attempt, vain as\nit may be, an admission fee is charged to cover the cost of the train service. On account of the trains the intending visitor is not allowed to walkin the tunnels. An unfortunate oversight in the design of the carriages has resulted in the proffered views not being all that could be desired. Moreover, the speed a t'h ich the trains are run makes many\nvisits necessary to appreciate the subtler features of their mysteries. In an attempt to remedy this 'the company running the train service now slows\nand frequently stops the trains when the visitors \u2022 are most numerous. In the shallower tunnels roth ol93 have formed In the roof giving the visitor \u2022a welcome glimpse of the sky. Such is the depth of these places that the sun Is often totally obscured and indeed it is only in the height of summer that the sun penetrates\n\u2022to the lower recesses of these canyons.\nThe inside of the tunnels carries a peculiar deposit of a friable substance which analysis shows to be mainly graphite, hence the adjective black. Its origin is obscure and it Is a debatable point as to whether it is diamond in the 'process of decay or formation. Research into this phenomena Is being contemplated as is the \u2022 exploration of the remoter caverns of Kensington. Reports of the activities of fellow cavemen in this direction would be welcomed.\n\n"

SOCCER The reo or d of the1 st XI does not make very exciting reading., Ii DC r\"59432P18 Against46 In spite of the a e dismal figures, the team\nhas at times played exceedingly good football, but all too often the forwards nave been ineffective near the goal, with the result that no goals were scored when the team waa on top. All the blame does not lie with the forwards since the tally of goals against speaks for itself. The 2nd and3 rd XT's are having extremely good seasons, especially the latter, who are way ahead at the top of Division IV of the University League; and if the2 nd XI can manage to win Division III( they are2 nd at the moment)\nthe two teams will each be promoted. On Saturday, January28*. h, the1 s tH braved the o old weather and made along poach journey to Cambridge. St. John's College were to be\nthe opponents. The ground conditions turned out to be quite reasonable, although the frozen ruts in the surface made the ball a lively obJ ep t to control. Before the match waa a minute old St, John's went ahead with a simple goal. It was as though the I.C. team had not realised that the match had begun.\nA further tragedy occurred for the visiting side when a few minutes later R. Robins had to leave the field with as trained knee. This brought out all the fighting spirit in the I.C. team, who battled gamely to reduce the arrears. Yet another injury hit the I.C. team, and for the whole of the second half R. Burrows had to va o ate the left bao k position and play left wing. This handicap was too much for the visitors and St. John's won by that first minute goal. TECHNICAL PHOTOGRAPH COMPETITION. The I.C. Photographic Society invites retries\nfor a technical photograph competition. Pictures of research apparatus, specimens and\nindustrial processes are ese cia i ly we lc or a e. Prints, half plate and above should be sent\nto the Hon. Sec. I.C.P. S., via the Unions\nrack by 28th February 1954\nSHOOTING If he sounds out of date -with match results,\ndo not blame your reporter, for the results of\nleague matches arrive by post a week or a fort night after the last shot is fired. Unsatisfactory in many ways, but cheaper than travelling to Birmingham, Durham, Liverpool, Cambridge,\nJrford and Manchester in successive weeks.'\nThe Inter-University League table after three\nrounds 3tarts as follows:\nS WDL Points Aggregate\n1. Cambridge \"A\"3300623642. Imperial College\n\"A\"3300623423. Liverpool 3 2 0 1 4 2348\n* 3 I write, the \"A\" team is in a state of suspense over its match against Liverpool, and by the\ntime this account is read most of the cards will have been shot in the needle match against Cambridge. Without wishing to chafe the sore of\nrelations with the University, the Rifle Club\ntrumpet must be blown: U.L.\" A\" are running 5th, having been soundly beaten by Imperial College as\nwell as by Cambridge. However, in the 2nd Divi sion I. C.\"B\" lies4 th with U.L.\" B\"3rd and the\nresult of the match between them is in the post.\nGood luck, I.C,: your score looked good enough,\nbut no doubt London said the same about theirs.'\nNearer home. Imperial College is still holding\non to the Engineers' Cup. In Division1 I.C.\"A\" leads the field with U.C.\" A\" \u00bb close second and\nBattersea Polytechnic not far behind. I. C.\"B\" is fifth but have a good aggregate and should soon\nrise. The \"C team were leading Division 2 after\nthe second round, but have 3ince had a bye and no\nfurther information is available for a few days.\nThey cu st beware of U.C.\" B\", but otherwise seem\nfairly safe.\nA notable friendly match was shot r \u00ab s ntl y when Wimbledon Park R.C. were hosts to I.J.\"A\". On a strange and bitterly cold range Imperial\nCollege did not shoot well and were heavily\ndefeated by the quietly competent home team. So\nquiet was their competence that the names and\nheavily-emblazoned shooting Jackets were not at\nfirst connected with the two stocky little men who\nchatted easily as the teams prepared to shoot. It was Ernie Spirit! and H.R.\"t fall y\" Hammond, British Internationals, who scored the only two 200's that\nevening and quietly supplied as many points-worth\n5f advice after the nat ch. An enjoyable evening,\nonly curtailed by the approach of the last train home.\nSo much for the teams. On our own range,\nthe annual Club Competitions have started.\nEntries are open until February 19th, and all cards must be completed by February 26th. There\nis a competition for everyone from the worst shot\nupwards: prizes will be presented at the Annual\nDinner on March 25th. Some cards have already\n'been shot, but it is too early to make predictions.\nPistol enthusiasts are competing for the first ti7 \u00ab\ne for the Club Pistol Championship. Some\nexcellent scores have been returned, foretelling a healthy start to a new venture.\nThe first match between the three Colleges\nfor the Courtman Shield is fixed for 7/ed nes day February 17th. Since 1P323 Guilds have won the\ntrophy eleven times, the R.C.S. nine times, and\nthe Mines not at all. The donor, 2.0. Courtman,\n\u2022Jsq., A.R.S. ll., might feel he has been let down,\n\u2022ut on present form the l lines are unlikely to\nore ak tradition this year. A critical eye reveals\nthat the Guilds and R.C.S. teams are once again\nwell-matched: the \" tail\" will win the trophy this\nyear and decide whether or not the R.C.S. will hold\nit for the sixth successive year. R.W. G.U. LHJ. NEWSPAPER.

I.I. RECORD REVIEW.\nSo many long-playing records are being issued these days\nthat it must be difficult for the average music lever to\nchoose records which will give reasonable pleasure. I will try to give reviews that will help classical\" gram ophile s.\" Delius' \"The Mass of Life\" was first performed under\nSir Thomas Beecham in,1909 and it is he who conducts the\nreally magnificent set issued recently on Columbia 33CX1078/9. This set has given me much pleasure and the performance and recording are extremely good. There are a few\nmoments at the ends of sides when there is slight distortion\nbut 6ne has only to play the first side to realise what\ns uber b Delius it is. Four soloists and large choral and\norchestral forces are employed in a typically Delian manner,\nand the work is sung in the correct language - German,\naig h ly recommended.\nBeethoven'3 5th Symphony has just suffered a resurrection, for KLeiber has recorded on Decca LST 2851 a super-lat ive performance. The only other performance which can\ntouch it is the one of Karajan on Columbia, but the Decca\nrecording is so much better that I can safely say that if you want this symphony then buy KLeiber. On same gram a phones it may seen a little harsh, but that will be the\nfault of improper L.P, correction. This recording I would\nrank as one of Decca'- best.\nAt last that monumental Symphony Ho. 3 of Saijit-Saens\nis available in a wonderful performance on Columbia 33CX1116. This symphony is written in memory of Liszt and was\nfirst performed in1886. The work is scored for a mammoth\norchestra which includes two pianos, an organ and a large\nwoodwind section. This work is stated as having two movements but there are many sub-divisions in these. Hi fi enthusiasts will note a lack of frequencies above about\n8 Kc/s, but in view of such a thrilling performance it is only a small \"con.\"\nExtracts \u2022 from some of these recordings will be played\nat the Monday lunchtime gramophone recitals.

Council is to inaugurate a new scheme for organising hops. \"his action has been influenced by the\nview that there has been a steady deterioration in the\nstandard of the Saturday informal dances. Articles and\nletters in FELIX have shown that this view is widely held\nin I.C. and the Councils' move is an attempt to raise the\nstandard.\nAt present, clubs can only run hops on alternate\nSat'ir days as the other weeks are reserved for the informal\ndan css. organised by the Entertainments Committee. With an\nincrease in the number of clubs hoping to run hops, it was\nobvious that, unless the terms were made longer, there would\nnot be enough Saturdays to satisfy the demand.\nAlso, and contrary to a Council Itlnute concerning this matter, the clubs organising dances have been disposing of\nthe profits at their ov rr. discretion. Due to the scramble\nfor a Saturday tc run a hop, it is not possible to enforce\nclubs to budget for this in coa e in their estimates at the\nbeginning of the year.

Circulations1200 ise that our readers have had more\nthan enough in the way of apologies from us for bad standard in the printing of recent issues. Most people would like to see a college produced by letterpress. They quote KINGS NEWS and if as examples but our method of printing has enabled FELIX to run at the minimum\na\"( which has easily been made good by the\nannual dance) whereas the other college newspapers have had to receive heavy subsidies from the irrespective unions. This argument has been often heard in the past but even allowing for the style of printing, the' appearance of current issues still leaves much\nto he desired when compared with the FELIX of earlier years. The remedy lies partly with FELIX in doing its utmost to ensure that the typing is really black, in using photographs of the maximum\ncontrast and in using the correct technique in our drawings. The effect of deviation from these requirements is more marked since the printer recently started to use a different film in his reproduction process. But our efforts in producing a satisfactory a aster FELIX are wasted if the copies come on sale ari th great splurges of ink across their pages or with the pages stapled on the wrong side or in the 'wrong order. Although we accept the fact that our responsibility covers every sphere of the production of FELIX, such untoward happenings are outside our direct control. However, we assure our readers that we are making every effort to prevent ft recurrence of these accidents. If our efforts are successful we should have\ne clean and readable FELIX, but to give satisfaction, FELIX must be full of news and views of interest to its readers. This is only possible with the cooperation of all in1.0. FELIX reporters are present at all advertised functions but\npeople are also interested in the un advert is sd \u00abad\nunexpected events. We welcome reports of any of these activities and extend an invitation to all perpetrators of rags, stunts etc. to give us\ni \u2022\u2022\u2022 fi Vi oh things as soon as they bars Moat ed the so ene of their activities. The mention of rage usually brings s MM* nt* \u2022 childish conduct from some of our community.\nBut this divergence of thought about rags is only one Instance of opinions differing and there are countless other topics w nl ch provide some on* or nith alias of argument against the usual \u2022 of the student body, t f you give, your views to FELIX we are certain that many will dl s.. ir. you, j usl aa we are certain that% r \u00bbTT\u2022 ' tag rfc bat y K LIX is as good as it could be. It's up to everyone to let us know what\nthey don't like and what they do like and perhaps l iLl X will bs more truly representative of I.C. VIEWPOINT The formation of a women's boat club has recently been\ndiscussed between members of I.C. Vf.A and boat club officials. The need for more women at I.C. is clear, since at least two\ndozen active members and a coach would be necessary to produce two racing crews, including the necessary reserves.\nBoat Club diehards may think that woman's place Is on\nthe towpath, or even elsewhere altogether, but if sufficient and lasting support could be guaranteed for such a venture,\nthen I.C. should have a women's boat club. I. C.W. A. must\nrealise, however, that it is unreasonable to expect the\nconsiderable alterations to the boat house necessary to\ncater for a handful of their members who might not row reg-ul a rly after all. It would be impractical to maintain\ntheir ac como dati on solely for occasional pleasure outings.\nThe solution is surely for our Amazons to Join U.L. women's boat club, which has good facilities. The Boathouse Committee should give the matter further attention when the boat house extensions are being planned in the next\nfew years. By this time firmer support for the club should\nbe assured, as college membership will be larger, and I.C. could well have a ladies' VTII which would be the scourge\nof the river. \"Belle-note.\"\nft\u00ab<:w \u00ab< M \u00ab , WHICH WAV \u00ab* Tie fit\nFELIX congratulates the following on their MVUMIWWtt tOll ff Jnaes to Cynthia Fondrous (of Royal\nHolloway College)\nDoug Hykin *to Joan Vi'int'er\nM PERSONAL\" ADVERTISEMENTS FOR SALE a pair of motor cycle waders - fi to yer size 9 or 10 shoes - offers?

RECORDS\nKindly apply\nA SOBERING THOUGHT It has been very noticeable in the last few rears which we may more generally call the post war years that the number of suicidal attempts i ents of Oxford, Cambridge, London and other of the larger Universities, is increasing at an\nalarming rate. Last year's total number was so\nhigh, that it has been decided to hold an\nenquiry into their possible causes. This survey is now carrying on its investigations, and their results are expected to be published in the near future. The possible causes which are always given are mental instability as a result of financial and\nscholastic worries, but more recently the whole University system has been attacked. The time therefore seems ripe to' stand and\nstare, in this world of troubled care', and decide whether the present University system is the best possible. It ensures that a student may leave the sol leg e with an imposing degree, but does it mat ure that student so that he may face the prospect of fighting. for his place in this world of speed and efficiency, and ultimately maintain a position as a self supporting, decent living citizen? The University system of'fend for yourself \u2022 undoubtedly helps to develop any strong minded\nstudent, who would however get on under practically any circumstances. To the weak minded It can often lead to disastrous results \u2014 and does. These\nstudents find it difficult to keep up with the\nwork necessary, and leave all that is not compulsory. This is very prevalent among ' fresher s'. The result is that when exams loom ahead of them,\nthey prey heavily on their subconscious minds. If all work was made oom pul so ry they would do as well as any student, and could start off in life with a good University foundation behind them.\nInto this class fall the' underlings' or 'back-room boys' who do efficiently and willingly all that they are told, but who would fail hopelessly if put in a position of responsibility. They are the many who do not join any University societies; and keep themselves strictly to themselves. They\nareas important in this world as any Einstein or Churchill. Should,, therefore, the University system be\ndrastically revised, to gain results from all students and not only the stronger willed, or is it better as; it is? "
