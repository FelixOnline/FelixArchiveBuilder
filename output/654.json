    "content": "The Cults\nMembers of the Unification Church have been seen around College in the past week,\ndiscussing religion, God and life with anyone who stops to talk to them. While you are in\nLondon you will doubtless be approached by at least one of the hundreds of religious cults\nwhich are kicking around offering peace, tranquility and self-awareness. These cults have\nbeen described by church leaders and the mass media as dangerous homewrecker s, needlessly\ndestroying lives and have been accused of employing brainwashing techniques to undermine\nsociety. However Duncan Campbell investigating cults for City Limits f round them to be on\nthe whole quite harmless organisations in which some people have unhappy experiences and\nother people have enlightening experiences. He described the new religions as a form of\nspiritual jogging: \"You look a bit silly, you feel better and you really benefit yourself. The\nChurch's condemnation of them seems hypocritical, the chain store defending itself against\nthe Oriental street shop which stays open later and offers a more convenient service.\"\nIn this special FELIX investigation we attempt to find out what these cults are about, how\nto recognise them and whether they are as dangerous as is often made out.\nHare Krishna\nEveryone must have met Hare Krishnas at some\ntime. They used to be conspicuous in their saffron\nrobes and shaven heads. Now they are more likely\nto be seen dancing gaily amongst shoppers in\njeans, inviting you to make a donation in turn for\na 'free' book or record. They might invite you\nback for a free meal at their place.\nMembers of the sect are required to live in\ntemples and submit themselves completely to\ntheir temple leader, to the extent of having their\nmarriages arranged. Members are strict vegetarians and do not drink, smoke, gamble, or play\ngames. Life is full of prayer and services and\ncollecting on the streets with only five hours of\nsleep. The cult believes that men are superior to\nwomen. Sex is only allowed for married couples\nand only for procreation. A Moonie preaching the Gospel according to Rev Sun Myung Moon outside\nMoonies\nPerhaps the best known of all the cults, especially\nsince losing the largest libel action in British legal\nhistory, the Moonies specialise in approaching\nlost or lonely young people. They will seem very\nfriendly and will invite people back to their\nLancaster Gate headquarters and give them the\n'loving treatment' over a cup of coffee. People\nwho show an interest in the sect are invited back\nfor a meal and are persuaded to go on a 'course'\nfor a weekend, where they are given 'intensive\nteaching' consisting of physical exhaustion, sleep\ndeprivation or incessant lectures and pressure to\nconfess faults. People who wish to join are encouraged to give up their jobs, home, possessions\nand live at one of the Church's centres.\nThe School of Economic Science\nYou may have seen the School's advertisements\nin tube stations for philosophy courses. They run\na twelve week lecture course for just \u00a316, \u00a38 for\nstudents. The philosophy they teach is their own.\nOne of the first things the school*will tell you is\nnot to tell your friends about the lectures otherwise the importance of what they tell you will be\nlost. They will tell you that the school is the most\nimportant element in your life. If you decide the\nSpecialFeature\nschool is not for you and decide to leave they will\npester you with letters, asking why you have left.\nThey sometimes make personal calls too.\nA number of students are persuaded to stay on\nat the school as 'helpers' doing menial tasks at the\nschool free of charge and running the school.\nScientology\nYou will probably come across Scientologists\nalong Tottenham Court Rd or Portabello Rd\noffering free personality tests. The results will\nreveal that you are really quite an awful person\nand that salvation can only be gained by taking\none of their very expensive courses.\nScientology was founded by the well-known\nScience Fiction writer L Ron Hubbard, and\nclaims to be able to effect dramatic improvement\nin the mental and physical well-being of its ad-he rents. In his book Dianetics, the modern science\nof mental health, Hubbard describes how one\nmight advance through a series of grades by\nundertaking a course of training and tuition,\npayment for which may amount to hundreds,\neven thousands of pounds.\nit's not only your money they' re after......

Gate, LondonSW7 SAB,(lei: Oi-373 or when1 you first attend., THE SCHOOL OF ECONOMIC SCIENCE\nThe advertisement of a philosophy course interested me immediately. I felt that purely scientific training left undesirable gaps in my\nknowledge of culture and my ability to look at the world from a 'mature' standpoint. I'm normally as apathetic as the next man, but\nthese lectures were in Queensgate. What a piece of luck, I felt!\nI would not have followed up a classified ad, but this double\ncolumn looked impressive and respectable. The descriptions: \"the\ngreat philosophic teachings which have enabled men and women\nthroughout the ages to discover direction and purpose in their\nlives...etc\" are compelling and, even as I re-read them, beautiful.\nWhat now seems strange is that an organisation I had never heard\nof, the School of Economic Science, should list nineteen schools all\nover England and repeat the lectures every evening of the week\n(when other adult e duct ion classes frequently teeter because the\nnumbers don't justify one evening). This advertisement even\ninvites us to vary our day of attendance.\nTo my surprise, the lecture went slowly. After ten minutes the\nlady lecturing hadn't said anything at all. But she was obviously well\nprepared and soon coaxed the class into a discussion about\nwisdom. Somehow our result was-a general agreement on a verbose definition which meant nothing. I was disappointed, but at\nleast I had contributed to the discussion. Since the rest of the class\nhad all beer, involved in formulating our definition, I assumed that I was more illiterate than I had supposed. The rest of the time until\nthe break was more useful. We studied a diagram about conscious-ness. It wasn't very scientific, but who was I to object to the ideas of\n(as I thought) the great philosophers? The teacher was a beginner,\nbut I could hardly fault her after she told us that she and her\ncolleagues worked unpaid, for the love of it. It never occured to me\nthat this was strange.\nAfter tea we heard some soporific passages and then learnt how\nto isolate ourselves from our surroundings by deep concentration!\nI know that this is supposed to help philosophers, but I had not\nknown how important it was.\nThankfully, I never went back (despite the letters). This happens -in many cases, and the falling register causes the daily classes to\nmerge. In the remaining cases, students may never leave. There is\nno problem in persuading them all that one evening is convenient\nbecause they are taught that the School is the most' important\nelement of their lives. I have seen how full the school is of\nhelpers\u2014continuing students who run the place.\nWhilst the organisation's philosophy may be of a quasi-religious\ntype and the followers may never go out and do any harm, they are\ndangerous because of their method. They believe that recruits\nbenefit most from the course, by having their personalities rearranged and 'improved'. This task is initiated secretly, although at\na later date the student always agrees that what happened was for\nthe best. He has no choice: they all believe that it is for the best.\nThe only reason why I did not go to the second lecture is that I described the course to some friends. They were rather impressed\nby my description, but another overheard our discussion and\nenquired about the name of the school. He told me about the real\nnature of the course which I was so proud to be attending. I did not\nwant to believe him: the people there were so pleasant. Yes, he\nreplied, that was why he stayed for a year. His teachers pestered\nhim to come back when he left, though the 'treatment' had only\nfailed for his group because he became a trouble-maker after\nbecoming suspicious. The staff are so pleasant that they never\nreact strongly, even if you tell them that they are in a Mooney-like\ncult. They wii l try to convince you that it isn't so, which is what you\nprefer to believe anyway.\nTHE MOONIES\nWell, despite being warned by just about everybody, last week I was\npicked up by a Moonie. I had a few hours to kill before the Clint\nEastwood party and was wandering very much aimlessly past Mech\nEng. Fatal! A sweet and quite innocent looking Japanese girl sidled\nup to me with a few questions. New from the Orient she was ever so\ninterested in learning about English students. Her simple aim in life\nwas to become a perfect person. What an appeal to my vanity! She\nthen asked me over to see her friends.\nI had told her I must leave promptly at 7:00pm so I was rushed\nupstairs to watch a lecture on video. Had I waited for the live\nversion the psychological pampering might have kept me spell-bound. The title flashed on \"The Divine Principle\" by the Rev\nMoon.\nThe Divine Principle offered apparent perfection. All through\nhistory, it began, religion had been advancing. From Adam and Eve\nto Moses and the stone tablets. From the commandments to\nJesus. Well now the Rav Moon has appeared as the progression on\nfrom Jesus. Take the step and follow Moon and your character\nwould reach perfection.\nThe first video lecture, as an introduction to the cult, offers an all\ntoo simple route to success. The reality though is a life of devotion\nto Moon. You no longer think for yourself as your mind becomes\ntrapped and the Moonies milk you dry.\nAfter the video it was question time. The Japanese girl and I sat\ndownstairs and talked about famine and world hunger. She had an\nanswer to all my questions. On a slightly different level though, was\nhow comfortable and relaxed I was made to feel. The Japanese girl\naddressed me always by my first name and was intently interested\nin me. I was made to feel important. There was no group. The\nJapanese girl was there to talk to me and me alone. This above all\nelse is their trick.\nPerhaps the reason established\nreligions are so very critical of\ncults is that they see them as\nrivals. The fact that the hundreds\nof cults that have sprung up in the\npast twenty or thirty years are so\npopular indicates the failure of\nestablished religions to communicate with the public, especially\nthe young.\nThe new religions certainly\nfulfil a need. The grassroots\npeople involved with them are kind\nand sincere and feel they have\n\u2022 something important to offer.\nHowever it is the motives of some of the people running the organisations that are a cause for\nconcern. These people are very\ndevious, peddling religion in con-veni ent, novel paca k ages and\nmaking a lot of money from it. Be\nwary of religions that are secret or\nwant your money or won't let you\nout, becuase they aren't after your\nmental and spiritual develop-ment-i hey are after you!\nPage 10 Friday, October 21, 1983\\ Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nCoffee\nCome Home\nDear Pallab\nMany of your new readers\nwill be unaware of the sad story\nof the Biology Common Room.\nThe Common Room was open\nevery morning and afternoon\nand served very reasonably\npriced cups of tea and coffee to\nmem be A of the Biology Department, although many\nothers frequently used it. It was\nextremely popular and served\nas a meeting place for staff and\nstudents alike.\nHowever, one fateful afternoon the coffee service was\nclosed due to staff sickness. It\nstayed closed for the remainder\nof last year due to a series of\nproblems principally concerning staffing. Eight months later\nit is still shut. This is despite the\npresentation to the Head of the\nBiology Department of a petition of over 200 names asking\nthat the coffee service be reopened as a matter of urgency.\nAlthough individuals on the\nDepartmental staff have devoted a great deal of time and\neffort to the matter, the Department as a whole has still been\nunable to find a solution to the\nproblem. Meanwhile an ,ir ren uj\n1\n2\nplace able part of College social\nlife has been lost.\nStudents in the Biology Department have certainly not\nforgotten their coffee service\nand are very eager for it to be\nreopened as soon as possible. In\nthe meantime we would very\nmuch welcome a statement\nfrom the Head of Department\nexplaining his plans for the\nfuture of the coffee service.\nYours thirstily\nPeter Burt\nCon Man\nReplies\nDear Pallab\nI was shocked and dismayed\n(!) to read Martin Attwell's letter of last week. How could\nhe possibly describe Conservatism as \"outdated\"? It is\nSocialism which has reached ars\\ r*v state of ideological bankruptcy.\nWhat new ideas do the Left es-po use? Just the same stale old\ndiet of nationalisation, conformity and rabid anti-Americanism.\n\u2022 Oh! And a 'National Economic\nAssessment' (oldest political\ntrick in the book\u2014if you don't have a workable policy, invent\nan impressive name for it). We\nneed only look as far as France\nto see that Socialism has failed\nagain, as it has always failed in\nthe past.\nMr Attwell seems to think\nthat Consoc is remiss in being\nmore interested in having par-ties, listening to speakers, going\non theatre trips and generally\nenjoying ourselves than in\nputting motions on Nicaragua\nor South Africa to UGMs and\nboring everybody rigid. Such\nmotions have no relevance to\nstudents, and it should therefore come as no surprise that\nthey are not interested in them.\nSurely there are many issues\nwithin the College that would\nbe better subjects for debate\n(for instance the state of student\nac como dati on, refectories etc).\nOn a lighter note, I am\ndelighted that our badges are so\nfamous. We have a wide\nselection, all very reasonably\npriced, and posters too! If you\nwant one, get in touch with us\nvia the SCC rack in the Union\nOffice!\nYours right-of-centre\nRichard Monkhouse\nPS: What is a 'coordinate\ncampaign'? Is it a Cartesian\nCause or a Polar Plot?\nAbsolute\nPower\nIt is inevitable that those\npeople in power will make\ndecisions which are advantageous to both themselves and\ntheir friends but it is to be hoped\nthat the Union Office will be\nmore subtle in future since\nGaynor Lewis' receipt of a parking permit, considering\nthat she lives in Linstead Hall,\nindicates an all too obvious\nper suit of self-interest.\nN Shackley\nJAN P KAKE RlSrWX WI HP S OF( THEMSELVeS T fci lU Gr To MAINTAIN | T\\ THE^ o/0 OF OS OR.IMNAB.Y ICS Tot>eM TS BORE OF TAU KK DS OWN TO VE.Ry<3 oic x uv1( SO IT* LIKE.\"1 ATLEAST THC VO.N SMELL.

I was\nabout to tuck in when I heard an urgent whisper\nbeside me \"Don't eat it!\" I turned and saw a frightened face. \"Haven't you heard?\" asked the owner of\nthe face. \"Heard what?\" I asked. \"About the\nMooneys,\" he said, his face ashen with fear.\nHe went on to tell me, in hushed tones, how the\ndreaded cult, the Mooneys, had infiltrated the refectory at Primelia College. For those of you who don't know, the Mooneys are a cult who are attempting to\nkill off the human race by poisoning the food, and\nare named after Victor Mooney, a name to make\neven the strongest stomach turn.\nI went into the kitchen to investigate and found the\nchef, Sam O 'Nella, lying among some empty bottles,\nhe was rather the worse for wear, so I propped him\nup and attempted to get the full story from him while\nhe was drunk.\n\"We have five cooks,\" he said. \"Abdul, Zorba,\nPedro, Juan and only one woman, namely Donna\nKebab. Each one is assigned a certain meal to ruin\neach day. I 'll tell you what today's tasks were:\nAbdul ruined the moussa ka if Zorba ruined the\nlasagne.

Mikki is a potter, reasonably ambitious and in need of\nthat elusive, lasting affair. Billie is a junior\nexecutive, on the way up the ladder of success who is also in need of a lasting relation-ship, so their meeting at a disco inevitably\nleads to friendship and love. Yet, as the play\ndevelops, Billie's confidence is seen to be a veil covering his sexual inadequacy and his\nneed for psychoanalysis. So Mikki discovers\nTom and the resulting actions and reactions\nof the protagonists provide the basis of the\nplay.\nMuch of the humour derives of the verbal\ninterplay between these characters and the\njargon used by them. Such phrases as \"I think I'm going through are virgin ation\", \"and\nto the world I'm just an unemployed social\nworker\" and even Billie's statement \"I think\nthat I 'll kill myself\" cause laughter through\nthe inherent nature of jargon and the excellent delivery of the cast. The production\navoids overplaying the lines and lets their\nintrinsic humour do the work resulting in a sympathetic and warm response from the\naudience. The jokes directed against\nAmericans and the obsession with psychotherapy are not overstated, so that even a hardened American patriot can laugh without feeling guilty.\nThe acting of all of the three of the cast is of\na high standard. Nikki Scott portrays Mikki's desire for independence, coupled with her\nneed for love, with skill and conviction. The\nportrayal of Billie (by Mike Bridgeland) is no\nless skilful as an initially precocious, shallow\ncharacter is both apt and well performed with\nBillie's insecurities becoming apparent as the\nplay develops. Dave Simmon's character is a tion of the macho, experienced Tom is no\nless appropriate with Tom's fear of a com-mit ting, lasting relationship indicating his in-securities.\nThe show and the script are not without\ntheir faults. The script drifts into areas that\ncause embarrassment to the audience\u2014\nalbeit for a very short time\u2014and the script is\nsomewhat shallow in its character is at ions. Also, as ever with amateur actors, the\nAmerican accents prove something of a stumbling point altho ug this des tracts little\nfrom the humour it is occasionally annoying.\nHowever, beyond these somewhat minor\nfactors, the play is very well performed with a part of the somewhat monolithic Union\nConcert Hall having been transformed into\nan appropriately intimate theatre, providing\nan excellent venue.\nWhat Do You Say Before You Say Goodbye is being performed tonight, having originally being performed by Dramsoc at 1983\nEdinburgh Fringe Festival where it was very\nwell recieved, and tonight's performance at\n8:00pm in the Concert Hall is thoroughly\nrecommended.

So here is a delayed 'welcome' both to new students and returning ones.\nStudent Services is based on the Northside of Princes Gdns,\nat number 15, next door to the Health Centre. The office\ncomprises of a residence office and a welfare centre.\nOn the residence side, we look after all the Halls of Residence, allocating places and, of course, sending out bills. We\nalso have a private sector accommodation service maintaining\nlists of private addresses, nearby hostels and hotels, and a guide to some of the local accommodation agencies. We periodically produce two accommodation guides, one regarding College accommodation, the other private accommodation\u2014to\nhelp you through the maze of application procedures and\ntenancy agreements.\nOn the welfare side, we are able to offer legal advice on any\ndifficulties you encounter during your time here, as well as\nproviding information and help with social security benefits,\ncovenants, grants, tenancy problems, insurance, etc, etc. We\nalso maintain comprehensive stocks of leaflets on everything\nfrom cycle insurance to VD.\nThe all-important point to remember about a welfare office\nis that it is only any good if you are prepared to use it. Please\ndon't fall into the trap of believing that you have to let a situation reach crisis point before you seek help, when an early\nvisit to Student Services could prevent the crisis arising. We are\nalways happy to see people who are just interested in finding\nout more and with today's complex network of laws and\nbenefits it is always an advantage to be informed of your rights\nand entitlements in advance.\nWe hope to see you soon!\nMichael Arthur and Karen Stott\nStudent Services\nMONEY!\nHow to Claim Your Rent & Rate Rebates\nAl the beginning <\n>\nlA| \u00bbi il I!1''.1.1u*; \u00bb\nHousing Brniiit M 'IleuH ian iru iu \u00bbo ije ration a( Toss tuc IK.1 In- -che nic ha- replaced i he old tiu ii|> lua let! mil and r; tlc rebate -che nic ami removed\nIrv s| tonsil>iiii> lot\" meeting housing\ncn-l| ni l hoe oil - Up pl t'U1C I11aI\\ unc ni|) Io\\ nie nl bench) lio in the\nI)HS S in the local, authorities.\nTill' che nic introduced I wo new\nl\\ pes ol housing\u2022 ben el it and a bureaucratic nightmare that will keep town\nhalls in (i irn it> il it ir m< mi lis.\n1.

    "content": "...To Eat or Not to Eat: Is That Your Question?\nFor those of you who are new\nto College life at IC, let me\nintroduce you to the various\nrefectory outlets around the\ncampus, with the following list of\nopening times and a resume of\nservices provided. For those of\nyou who have returned to IC for\nyet another academic year, I should like to point out some of\nthe new innovations to be found\nin the refectories this year:\nRefectories\nFirstly, the JCR Buttery has been\ncompletely refurbished over the\nsummer vacation. Even if it's not\none of your regular eating places,\nwe hope that curiosity will entice\nyou to visit the 'new' Buttery. A greater choice awaits you at the\nSandwich Bar, including a variety of filled french bread rolls\n(substantial enough to satisfy the\nlargest of appetites!).\nFor those of you who want a quick, hot snack, the cafeteria in\nthe Union Lower Lounge is now\nserving pitta bread filled with\nbeefburger and salad.\nIn the Southside Refectory, a wider range of evening meals has\nbeen proposed, with a new\n'called-to-order' service from\n5:30 to 6:30pm daily, for dishes\nsuch as freshly cooked omelettes.\nSouthside Shop\nAll ICU regalia has now been\nmoved to the Walkway, Sherfield, leaving more room in the\nshop for extra consumables and\nhardware, such as kettles, for the\n'self-caterers' amongst you. It is\nalso envisaged that longer opening hours may be introduced this\nyear. Yes! Late-night shopping at\nIC!\nCollege Wines\nMany of you may be unaware that\na large selection of table wines\nand port may be purchased direct\nfrom the Collge cellar at reasonable cost. There's a variety of\nboth classical and less well-known French and German\nwines, as well as some American,\nSpanish and Italian vino. If\nyou're looking for cheap plo nk, forget it; but, with a discount of\n7'/2\n% for six. or more bottles (of\nany type), Common Room Claret\nand Burgundies are excellent\nvalue for money. Orders can be\nplaced with the Refectory Office,\nGround floor, Sherfield; price list\non application.\nFELIX mw m niH^ MKmmm\nHave you eaten in a College refectory or bar this week? If not,\nwhy? Is it the food? the service? the cost? or, what? Remember that\nthe refectories sited around the College'campus, are provided as a Service for you. Consequently, if you are dissatisfied, don't bore\nyour colleagues with complaints, but make your grievances known\nto us. The Suggestions and Complaints Committee is one of\nseveral sub-committees of the College Refectory Committee (with\nboth staff and student representatives), which reports directly to\nthe Rector.

There's a Suggestions and Complaints box\nin each refectory, and regular\ncommittee meetings ensure that\nany problems are promptly dealt\nwith. However...if your hot dish\nis cold, or your meat pie, empty,\nwhy go hungry? These are the\ntype of problems which can\n(usually) be sorted out immediately. Try a quiet word in the\ncashier's ear! If you are still\ndissatisfied, contact us. Remember, be positive. These are your\nrefectories; if you don't like them,\nthen perhaps you'd like to tell us\nwhy. We can't promise miracles,\nbut we'll do our best!\nNJ Barrett\nChairman,\nRefectory Sub-Committee\nWhy not pay a visit\nto the Regalia Shop?\nPage 5\n\n"

By avoiding the use of speakers\nfrom both the major political parties we hope\nto avoid a party political slang ing match and\nlook forward to a more purposeful and considered debate on the actual issue. The event\nis open to anyone and is in Mech Eng 220\nstarting at 1:00pm. The debate will provide you with an opportunity to make your opinion, and criticisms of\nthe main speeches known as vo u will be given\n1\nan opportunity to make a short speech from\nthe floor, which the speakers can reply to in\ntheir summing up.

My\nfirst request is for any ladies who would like\nto play football against Digby Stewart College, strictly on a friendly basis, one Sunday\nafternoon. Drop me a line if you're interested,\nit should be good for a laugh.\nSecondly, if any of you have any complaints such as bad changing facilities, lack of\npractice times, no opposition, let me know\nand I 'll see what I can do.\nBye for now.\nGabby\noc key Old Merchant Tailors 3 IC l sts0 Once again the Hockey Club set off to a far\nflung corner of the empire. Thanks to a rather\nhazy geographical knowledge of the Watford\narea and some dubious organisation the team\narrived minus three players and their shirts.\nThe gallant eight who did arrive, defended for\nabout 25 minutes and managed to hold off a near constant attack despite the force 8 gale\nand driving rain. Just as OMT scored their\nfirst goal, two of the missing players turned\nup, and both Margaret and Matthew made\ntheir .presences.\nThroughout the remainder of the first half and the second half, the game was very evenly\nmatched but OMT managed jto convert two\nof their chances whilst IC were unable to\nfinish off their attacks successfully. Nick\nHope and Geoff Ayers both came very close\nto scoring, but a combination of bad weather\nand bad luck kept the ball out of the OMT\nnet. This report is not for the acrostic\namongst us. (Or far anyone else either!-Ed)\nIC 2nds3 Harrow Swans 0\nA reformed 2nd XI arrived at Harlington in\ndrizzle, which soon developed into driving\nrain and sleet. Despite this the 2nds played\nsome fine hockey throughout both halves,\nresulting in a10 lead at half time due to a deft\nChas Eldridge lob and quick execution by\nChris Akers. The second half pressure was\nrewarded with another two good break-away\ngoals by Chris and Roger Roesink, to give a hopefully not too rare win. The only flaw in\nthe team was perhaps the goalkeeper, who\npicked the ball up outside his 'D', proving he\nhas difficulty keeping tack of where he is, let\nalone the goal!\nIC 3rd2 Old Creightonians 2\nNine green bottles sitting on a wall,\nFrozen to death out in the squall,\nWaiting for the opposition nowhere to be\nseen,\nNo need to mention that we were very keen.\nOff to the bar to fill us with sap,\nHelp this report is absolutely \u2014\nWe drew 2-2\n(I agree!-Ed)\nBasketball\nThe season starts in a couple of weeks, so\nserious training must start now. Training\ntimes are 5:30pm Mondays and 12:30pm Thursdays in the Volleyball Court. (We hope\nto obtain better facilities in the, near future for\nleague fixtures and training.)\nWe would also like to start a second team if\nwe have sufficient interest. Don't worry if\nyour standard of play isn't high, our coach\nwill soon put that right, and if you're a seven\nfoot tall American then we want to hear from\nyou!\nOur performance in the League last year\nwas poor to say the least, the main problem\nwas lack of commitment from many of the\nplayers. So there's plenty of room for im-prove ment, and the Boss says we'll do better\nwith the right sort of team spirit.\nFinally we may start a women's team to\nparticipate in a league or just play friendlies if\nthe interest is there.\nFor more information about the basketball\nclub contact me via the letter-racks or turn up\nnext Monday.\nRifle &\nPistol\nAs usual the first few weeks of the year have\nbeen very hectic for IC's top sporting club.\n(If the Badminton Club is libelled again there'll\nbe trouble!-Ed)\nWe are still looking for new members, and\nyou are more than welcome if you have done\nany target shooting before. For those of you\nwho were put off by the crowds on the first\nWednesday, the congestion is nowhere near\nas bad now, so come back and have another\ngo.\nThis year's most promising newcomer\nGareth Jones is already beating members of\nthe A team, and club treasurer Steve Harrison\n(contact via Elec Eng letter-racks) is fighting\nhard to retain his place in the first team.\nGordon Bowser, Club Captain, has already\nshot his first 'ton' this term, and looks set to\nmaster the sport by emptying his bank account on more and more esoteric equipment.\nIs there any limit to this man's madness?\nThe ICRPC Sloane Ranger pub crawl is\nthis Wednesday. Meet at the Sports Centre at\n7:00pm for our tour of the Admiral Cod,\nAustralian and a few others to find out what\nreally matters in the Sloane cet n re of the\nworld.\nOn Sunday October 30 we have our first\nBisley trip to shoot full-bore rifle at 300 and\n600 yards. Cost is approx \u00a36 and very worth-while.\nSport\ng by IC 10 Met D Div 6\nFor the team's first outing of the season,\nImperial College forced a rather hefty police\nside. Their pack contained many a hundredweight of prime bacon with a front row whose\ncombined centre of gravity must have been\nonly inches from the ground. However the IC\nteam soon took command and with' adventurous rugby, tries were run in by John Davis\nand Steve Philips. This new style approach\nwas not to everyone's satisfaction. Wingers\nNeil Hargrove and Steve Craig complained of\ngetting too much ball and Charlie de Rohan\nsorely missed his usual gentle stroll between\nscrum s. After the game the team all enjoyed\nseveral cans of Tango before dispersing to the\nCollege libraries to solve a few problem-sheets\nIC 2nds3 Met Police A Div 28\nWe set off for the annual season-opening\nfight with the police, who usually use this\nstudent confrontation to get their own back\nfor all the hassles we cause them during the\nrest of the year! Instead of the usual, older\nand more lethargic outfit than ourselves, we\ncame across a large, fit and young side, which\nwas to lead to our downfall. We took the lead\nwith an early penalty, and led 3-0 until the last\n20 minutes, but were never really on top.\nFinally, size and weight took its toll, and they\nran in their points in the last quarter. Apart\nfrom a blow that would have done a certain\nPC Finch* proud, it was a clean game and a promising start to the season.\nMark Hudson\n*If this is libellous, since the case is being\nheard at the moment, then please insert\nFrank Bruno.\n2nds vs QMC won 9-10\nShadows of bent old children hug the pus\nstrewn pavement. Noses kiss .the heavy scent\nof musty tenements, looming tyrants in black\nand brick poses of abandoned gaiety. The sun\nsets and rises in five minute bursts of purple-red glory, illuminating the crimson stars, and\nthe black moon festooned with paper\nstreamers.\nBlack uniformed giants stride rapidly up\nand down the cats-eyes in the road, glaring\nand winking knowingly at each other.\nMeanwhile, at QMC, a shuttle flies over the\nnet. It is not returned. This appears to be the\nreason for the hilarity described earlier, as the\nnow dormant shuttle signifies, in its own\nquiet way, that the seconds have won and are\nstill unbeaten since 1981. Oh, I forgot, the\nyear is 3272.\nPS: There is no Badminton practice tonight,\nas the Volleyball Club have a match. Back to\nnormal next week, don't forget there's coaching from 6:30 to 7:30 on all Fridays that we\nhave the court.\nFELIXi I Friday, October 21, 1983 IPage 15\n\n"

    "content": "Guilds\nWinkers\nTwenty Imperial students,\nmostly from City & Guilds Union\ninvaded Capital Radio last\nFriday to give a demonstration of\nwinking.\nAfter a short practice at South\nKen tube they descended upon\nthe unsuspecting Capital Radio\nstudio.\nEd Braman, the producer/\npresenter of the news, was\namazed when informed that 400\npeople would be winking down\nOxford Street.\nMike Stuart, President of City\n& Guilds Union, in characteristic\nstyle hogged all the publicity and\nsucceeded only in making a total\nBaldy Mike Stuart hogging\nthe publicity.\nwally of himself, as usual, to the\nnation's capital and was given a demonstration by Charles Relle,\nthe London Open Tiddlywink\nChampion.\nMusic While You Eat?\nThe smart new Royal College of\nMusic refectory, which at the\nbeginning of term proudly displayed invitations to all IC\nstudents from its windows, is now\nintroducing a30p surcharge on\nall meals to anyone not producing a RCM Student Association card.\nThis has become necessary,\nPetra Dargan, Vice President of\nthe Student Association, ex-plaine d, because of the extraordinary number of IC students\nusing the canteen. The students\nwhen questioned by the SA as to\nwhy they were using RCM's facility explained, in rather un-savoury terms, the difference that\nexists between the food served at\nthe RCM canteen and 'the food\nserved in the College canteens.\nThe RCM has only one can-teen, the previous one in the old\npart of the building now being\nused as a library, and this is\nintended for RCM staff and\nstudents alike. But staff and\nstudents are now reluctant to use\nthe canteen as the queues are\nalways very long, and the Student\nAssociation Office has been\nflooded with complaints from\nangry and hungry professors.\nThe Student Association feel the\n30p surcharge is the only fair and\nfeasible solution to their overcrowding problem.\nThe SA denied that Victor\nMooney, Imperial College's Refectory Manager, has press uri sed them to levy the surcharge to make his prices more\ncompetitive.\nParking Barriers in Operation\nThe new traffic barriers on\nImperial College Road will come\ninto full operation at 5:00pm on\nFriday 28 October 1983. From\nthat time onwards vehicles driven\nby members of the College will be\nable to enter the main site as\nfollows:\nA. Imperial College Rd (main\nentrance)\n1. 7:00am to 5:00pm Mon to Fri\n(inc) through card-operated barrier or through warden-controlled\nbarrier.\n2. 5:00pm to 7:00am and\nthroughout Sat, Sun and periods of\nCollege closure through card-operated barrier or on Sundays\nthrough a coin-operated barrier.\nFELIX \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 BB1B.

As soon as they set\nfoot on the pavement the robbers\npounced, seizing the loot.\nThey then ran through the\nstore, brandishing .their\nhandguns as stunned staff and\nshoppers looked on helpless. The\nWaitrose manager and Securicor\nguards followed the thieves hot\nfoot as they ran up Gloucester\nRoad towards Kensington High\nStreet.\nThey soon had to give up the\nchase, as the villains made off in a fast car.\nFELIX reporter Dave Rowe\nwas in the store during the raid.\n\"I went rigid when Is aw the theft\"\nsaid David. \"It was like a bolt\nfrom the blue.\" He abandoned\nhis groceries to run to a nearby\ntelephone box, where he informed the nation's press of the\ntheft. (There goes another FELIX\nexclusive-Ed.)\nSilwood: More Balls\nThe Silwood Ball which was\nbanned last academic year will\nhappen again this year.\nThis extremely popular annual\nevent, run by the Royal College\nof Science Union, was prohibited\ndue to the mess and d is organ is a tion after last year's event. An\nexpensive oak table was\nscratched and several lawns were\ndamaged by the coaches which\nferried people to and from the\nball.\nThe RCSU had its grant cut\nthis year as there was no expected\nexpenditure for the Silwood Ball.\nBut ICU President Gaynor Lewis\nnegotiated at length with\nProfessor Way, the Ex-Director,\nof Silwood Park' and other\nmembers of the Silwood Park\ncommittee to get the event\nreinstated.\nShe managed to persuade the\nSilwood residents to allow the\nball to take place provided that\nRCSU undertakes to clear up\nafterwards, that ICU helps in the\norganisation and that there is\nmore satisfactory communication between RCSU and Silwood\nPark Committee.\nYecfi/-Dirty old Mooncy\nThe appalling state of the ser very adjoining the Union Dining Hall was\nrecently brought to the attention of FELIX. Dirty food containers,\nseveral part full of mouldy food, were discovered and are pictured above\n(although the black and white photo doesn't do justice to the vivid colours\nof the mould). The floor is covered with rubbish and several large puddles,\nwith filthy shelves holding rock-hard bread rolls and old food. There is a pervading smell of decay. The ser very is used whenever dinners are held in\nthe UDH and, although the food is prepared elsewhere, the disgusting\nstate of this food serving area must raise serious questions about Mr\nMooney's standards of hygiene in his other refectories.\nI Friday, October 21, 1983 II Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Zelig (Warner West End) This\nfilm underlines Woody Allen's reputation as one of the finest\ndirectors in the world. Zelig is a technical masterpiece.\nAllen has covered the themes\ncontained in Ze/ig many times\nbefore, but this time he has\nsucceeded in making them integral with the plot\u2014his themes\nare less clumsily introduced and\nso more hard-hitting when you\nrealise what he's trying to say.\nZe/ig is the totally faked documentary biography of a 'human\nchameleon' who becomes a world-wide celebrity in the 1920s and 30s. There are clips of old\nnewsreel with Woody Allen\nmagically inserted, grainy home\nmovies, faked newspaper\ncuttings and interviews with\nsupposed survivors of Zelig's era\nand real life intellectuals like Saul\nBellow who provide false 'social\ncomment'. The care and detail\nput into creating it all is over-w hel ming, as is the cost: over\n\u00a320m for just 79 minutes of film.\nLeonard Zelig is a second\ngeneration Jewish immigrant and\nlike so many in the US (a nation\nof immigrants) desperate to fit in,\nbe invisible. He has no identity,\nno character to call his own, so\nhe has unconsciously become an\nexpert at mirroring other\npeople's personalities, both\nphysically and mentally.\nAmongst rabbis he speaks Yiddish and grows a beard, amongst\nnegroes he turns black, with fat\nmen he grows a paunch. Zelig is\n'discovered' and thrust into\nstardom, as psychologist Mia\nFarrow trys to cure him whilst\nfalling in love with him.\nThe jazz era is the perfect\nsetting for Allen to comment on\nthe meaningless distractions and\nsuperficial i ties of American soci-e ty, and on the loneliness, fears\nand personality traumas it can\ncause.\nYet Allen knows that everyone\nhas occasionally wanted to be\nlike Zelig and fit in perfectly, so\nthe film is not just pretentious\nsd fci al comment. He temporarily\ncures Zelig, makes him 'normal',\nsaying you mustn't be all things\nto all men, but be yourself.\nThe film, however, doesn't try\nto force anything down your\nthroat. It is witty, technically\nbrilliant and a delight to watch,\nhaving the rare ability to make\nyou laugh and make you think.\nWoody Allen psycho analysing psychoanalysts.\nMerry Christmas Mr Lawrence (on general release) is an\nin trui g ing film. I was not looking\nforward to it at first, suspecting a one-man David Bowie show. But\nBowie has a fairly small role, in\nterms of emotional impact.\nAlthough he tries too hard to be\nmeaningful and profound in\nevery line he speaks, he makes a reasonable job of an embittered\nsoldier torn with guilt. Bowie\nsticks out like a sore thumb from\nthe rest: he is so different, too\ndifferent, and is best in the more\nsurreal scenes of the film, out on ,\nhis own.\nThe film portrays the brutal life\nof a Japanese POW camp, with\nall the violently shifting emotions\nof supposed enemies cooped up\ntogether over a long time.\nLawrence, excellently played by\nTom Conti, tries to mediate\nbetween the Japanese and\nBritish. But they are so different:\nthe former so passionate and\nself-destructive, the latter either\npompous or jokey and cynical.\nBowie arrives, and everyone\nchanges. The best performance\nis by Ryuichi Sakamoto, the\ncamp commandant who finds\nhimself falling in love with Bowie.\nThe Japanese do not like to think\nthemselves gay.\nViolence occurs roughly every\nfive minutes, and ritual hara-kiri\nevery ten, until the film set is\ncovered with bodies. But despite\nthis Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence is well worth seeing,\nespecially to hear the music by\nSakomoto. I was humming it all\nthe way home.\nMy Tutor is not worth the\ncelluloid it's filmed on. It's an\nawful film. It's only value was to\nmake me realise how good Zelig\nis. A17 year-old male virgin has\nto pass his exams, and a beautiful\nFrench teacher (female) is hired..\n....blah, blah, blah. Only go and\nsee it ii you are offered money, or\nif you have multiple orgasms over\nan occasional bare breast.\nThere's a nipple too.\nTony Atkins\nBetrayal (at the Curzon St\nCinema) is an attempt to adapt a Harold Pinter stage play onto\nfilm. Unfortunately it shows.\nBetrayal is very English, very\narty and not very cinematic.\nThe theme, as you might\nexpect, is betrayal: of other\npeople and of yourself. The story\nanalyses an affair between a wife\nand her husband's best friend,\nmoving backwards in time from a husband and wife punch-up in\n1980 to 1972 when it all first fired\nup. The people are a smart\nHampstead set\u2014the literary sort\nwho watch films like Betrayal.\nPinter wants to show how the\nEnglish hide their feelings despite\noften surging resentments\nunderneath, and how although\neveryone knows what is going\non, they are more concerned\nwith keeping up appearances.\nAs a result the film concentrates almost exclusively on\ncharacter. The plot is rather thin\nand the affair seems sordid, dull,\nuncommitted\u2014it is difficult to\nsym pathis e with the characters.\nThis does not mean they are\nuninteresting, because the acting\nis superb. Ben Kingsley as the\nbetrayed and passionate hus-band, cool brittle Patricia Hodge\nand Jeremy Irons as her elegant\nyet emotionally clumsy lover are\nexcellent character actors. They\nknow how to use Pinter's dia-logue, which is taut, crisp and full\nof nuances of speech, meaningful\npauses and so on. The acting is\npleasant to watch and to listen to.\nThe main problem with the film\nis not the plot, with its gimmick of\n'scenes' like acts in a play, which\ngradually develop on the theme\nof betrayal. It is the camera-work\nthat is wrong. Pinter's intense\nclose-up action is ideal for the.\nstage and TV, but\u00bbfilm needs\nmore movement, av lder sweep.\nDirector David Jones tries to\nopen out the play by lots of\nstandard exterior shots and\npeople getting in and out of cars.\nThe camera is a mere recorder,\nand it looks ugly and clumsy at\ntimes. There is one ghastly scene\nin a pub, with the camera shifting\ncontinually from one talking head\nto the next, back and forth, like\nwatching a tennis match.\nIf you ignore the occasional\nbad camera-shot and concentrate on the script and the acting,\nBetrayal always keeps you interested in what happens next (or\nwhat happened before). The arty\nin tell i gens i a it portrays are not\nparticularly nice people, so you\nend up watching it quite d is past sion at ely. Like Ian McEwan's The Ploughman's Lunch,\nBetrayal is essentially a comment on 'how we live now'.\nPage 8 Friday, October 21, 1983 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "\\Music\nLes Chevaliers-ICI!\nIN THE EARLY HOURS OF LAST SUNDAY PETER RODGERS VENTURED UP TO A WELL KNOWN NIGHT SPOT IN\nFASHIONABLE CAMDEN TO SEE THE CHEVALIER BROTHERS. HE'LL BE WATCHING THEM AGAIN TONIGHT IN\nTHE J CR WHEN THE ADMISSION WILL BE \u00a32 CHEAPER( ONLY \u00a31.50), BEER ABOUT HALF THE PRICE AND THE DISTANCE NOT SO FAR. MIND YOU, THEY WERE STILL\nWORTH GOING UP TO CAMDEN TO SEE THE SUPPORT WILL BE THE WEBSTERS A TEN PIECE TUMBLING JUGGLING AND SINGING ACT.1983 has been a remarkable year for\nreviving old songs, usually with great\ncommercial success but a reaction from\ncritics and artists which is aptly summed\nup by Carmel's comments on Wherever I lay my hat: \"What can you say but you\nprefer the original.\"\nHowever covering a musical style or\nera lock, stock and barrel generally\nreaps the opposite results. Tom Waits\nand Ry Cooder have been producing\nquality album ns for as long as I remember without ever threatening to deplete\nworld vinyl stocks due to their sales.\nNow let me introduce the Chevalier\nBrothers who have a distinct advantage.\nIn this country at least, they have been\ngigging solidly for almost two years\u2014\nthey started by busking at the markets in\nPortobello, Camden and Covent\nGarden, moving on to the pub circuit and\nnow they are venturing into prestige venues like Dingwalls. It is not clear into\nwhich of these categories Imperial\nCollege fits. The band have received a universal thumps-up from the critics and\nwere one of the bands chosen by the\nNME to play at that paper's night during\nthe ICA's press gang week.\n' Currently the band has five members:\nMaurice Chevalier (yeah?) on guitar,\nRaymondo Gelato on saxophone, Roger\non vibraphones (metal xylophones) and\nthe rhythm section of Clark Kent on\ndouble bass (yeah, yeah?) and Pete\nFairclough on drums. They all wear zoot\nsuits, braces and terrible ties whilst belting out some superb 40s Jump Jive.\nMaurice's guitar playing ranges from the\ntight sound of Django Reinhardt thru to\nsome wonderful 'fat' chords and rock'n 'roll runs, whilst Raymondo's sax\nplaying is totally different from the\nsound we have become accustomed to\nhearing in the past five years\u2014he just\nblows and does it sound good. The\nrhythm section is tight having discarded\nthe gimmicky tea-chest bass although\nMaurice and Raymondo\nFELIX\nvibraphone solos are so unique that I don't think I 've ever heard one before.\nThe band cite Louis Jordpn, Count\nBasie, Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton\nand Benny Goodman as influences\u2014\nartists whose names are well-known but\nwhom I 've always associated with those\nawful big bands featured regularly on\nRadio 2 and hence occupy little space in\nmost students' record collections, but\ntheir music is neither aimed at Jimmy\nYoung/Terry Wogan land or 40s jazz\npurists; it mixes rhythm'n 'blues, jive and\nswing in with the jazz to form a highly\nenjoyable and dance able mixture and it\nisn't very serious or highbrow\u2014take the\nlyrics of the superb set-opener Three\nHanded Woman for instance: \"She's right handed, left handed, and underhanded too.\"\nOther numbers include well-known\nsongs like Caledonia and Reet Petite and\nalso the hilarious Open the (closet) door\nRichard.\nThe Chevalier Brothers are not for\neverybody although severe doubts could be expressed about anyone who\nfails to tap a toe or swing a hip during\ntheir set. If your taste extends beyond\nany one type of music you'll enjoy them.\nWkWoM Friday. October 21, 1983 t MW mW SINGLES\nRADIO SILENCE - THE PRIMARY\n(GOLD FISH)\nReleased on the College-based Goldfish\nlabel Radio Silence is a remarkably\nprofessional first single. The elaborate\nproduction allows scope for a wide\nrange of influences\u2014unfortunate ones\nlike ELO rub shoulders with Louise's excellent Souixsie sound-alike delivery.\nObviously written by the drummer and\nkey boa d player (the bass and guitar\nhardly get a look in) it rocks along\nnicely\u2014the keyboards are really quite\ngood although the drummer hasn't fully\nmastered the song's many changes of\npace. For further information contact\nPete Skelly, Chem Eng 3.\nREVENGE-THE GENTS (POSH)\nThe Gents are a group of angry young\nmen drawing parallels between the\nmurder of a young man who beat some\nsmall-time hoods at poker fifty years ago\nand the treatment they've received from\nrecord companies. The song starts with\na piano riff (like the one in Kim Wilde's View from a Bridge) which is repeated\nthrough the song and this coupled with\nrasping vocals and Lizzy-like guitar\nsound makes for a fine record spoiled\nonly by double-tracked vocals on the\nchorus\u2014Revenge is sweet\u2014which is too\nsmooth for the questionable motive of\nrevenge which the song advocates.\nTHE CAPTAINS AND THE KINGS\n-PHILIP CHEVRON (IMP)\nThe second release on Costello's pet\nproject label IMP delivers another attack\non British history and social values.\nLyrically only poking fun at the English\nupper class and the playing fields of\nEton the song is not a diatribe like Pills\nand Soap and its string quartet and cor\nanglais (nice touch) make it sound more\nlike a BBC period drama theme tune\nthan the latest from Philip Chevron,\nformer leader of excellent Irish punk\noutfit the Radiators. The Captains and\nKings is a truly remarkable and different\nrecord and even if it didn't involve three\nof the artists I respect the most (Costello,\nChevron and the song's composer Brendan Behan) the B side, Faithful\nDeparted, would still make it an essential\npurchase.\n\n"
