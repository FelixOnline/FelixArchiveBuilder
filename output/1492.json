In\nSlovenia and Croatia, there\nwere Roman ruins, sun, and\nenormous cocktails \u2013 Malaysia seems more likely to\nprovide jungles, beach and\ntemples.\nWith the help of our contacts in Malaysia, matches\nwill be played at Universiti Putra Malaysia, in Kuala\nLumpar, and Nur Insafi\nhockey club in Penang. Universiti Putra Malaysia have,\nworryingly, described themselves as semi-professional,\nand will doubtless provide a\nchallenging start to the tour.\nThe touring group, as is\ntraditional for ICHC, is a\nmix of all teams and abili-ties, ladies and men. A third\nof the party will have just\ncompleted their first year at\nImperial, and just less than\nthat will be about to leave us\n\u2013 what better way to finish\nthe year!\nAs many of us will be\ntravelling to that part of\nthe world for the first time,\nsome culture-shocks are\nsure to be had. The club\u2019s\nlast tour so far afield took us\nto India, where we struggled\nto fit into rickshaws, and\nwere stunned (mostly) by\nsome of the world\u2019s most\nfamous sights.\nThis time the trip will take\nin sights of Kuala Lumpur,\nsuch as the Petronas towers\nand the Batu Caves, before\nmoving onto the hill territories of the Cameron Highlands.\nPenang is our last stop,\nplaying hockey on the mainland (where our opposition have kindly agreed to\naccommodate us), before\nmoving out to the island\nwith its reputedly fantastic\nbeaches.\nIf reading this has you en-vious, join ICHC and make\nsure you don\u2019t miss out on\nnext year!

    "content": "FELIX Friday 10 june 2011 17\nCOM M ENT\nD\neleting people is a growing form of therapy. Perhaps happily, this is not\nthe latest jargon for serial-killing, but is a synonym\nfor a re-appraisal of \u2018Facebook friends\u2019.\nFacebook friends \u2013 those people you like\nor love, but also those people who have\ngot married and not told you, even after\nthe event. If those two categories are indistinguishable to you\u2026 oh dear.\nThe fact that we use the word \u2018Facebook\u2019 as an adjective for something like\nfriendship instantly devalues it. Think\nof all those films in which friendship\nis a strong theme: The Dam Busters,\nPeter\u2019s Friends, Bridge over the River\nKwai. Quite apart from them being from\nthe wrong age, the idea that the characters could be described as something so\nflimsy as \u2018Facebook friends\u2019 seems an\nalmost perverse comparison.\nThat is not to say I do not use, or dislike\nFacebook \u2013 it is good fun. Though I must\nadmit unless you are careful (or para-noid) about your settings, it is a way for\neveryone you have ever met to find you.\nProblem 1 with the system is the\npoint at which one \u2018adds\u2019 a friend. How\nPietro Aronica\nSamuel Furse\nEmbrace your mediocrity\n\u201cDeletion is referred\nto by many as the\nultimate smackdown\u201d\nFlimsy Facebook friends\n\u201cSo I urge you, be\nlazy. Be satisfied\nwith your simplicity.\nBe average. Be\nmediocre\u201d\nfrom her since, needless to say.\nI suppose one could restrict Facebook\nfriendships only to those one is in regular\ncontact with. But what would be the point\nof that? I know people who use Facebook\nonly for the opposite reason \u2013 for people\nthey never see frequently because they\nare overseas. Seems sensible, though if\nyou are in different time zones and doing\ndifferent things, communication for anything more than correspondence chess\nseems as unlikely as it is unworkable.\nFor myself, I use it for a mixture\nof these two reasons, and much else\nin between, as do most of my Facebook \u2018friends\u2019. In practice this is rather\nlike having my current friends, school\nfriends, ex-girlfriends, drinking pals, and\nmy mother in the same room, with social\netiquette preventing anyone from introducing themselves to anyone else. Just\nputting that list together has made me\nmore concerned. The sum total is that I\ncannot say what I think as there is always\na \u2018friend\u2019I would rather not hear about it,\nbut I can get in touch with virtually anyone of my acquaintances. Well, unless I\nhave deleted them for not knowing what\nnot to say at parties, that is.\nmany times have you added someone\nvia your phone after a bottle of wine\nand have never really met or spoken to\nthem since? This is also serious factor in\nproblem 2: at what point do you remove\nsomeone? In real life both of these seem\nfar easier: if you want to talk to someone and spend time with someone, you\ndo. If you do not, you do not. Not deleting someone because you might want\nto talk to them or know them has some\ncredence, but no more than keeping\nsomething expensive with no immediate use for but you do not want to have\nto replace. Having said that, removing\nsomeone and even blocking them can\nbe a punishment: deletion is referred to\nby many as the ultimate smack-down.\nFair enough, but if someone deleted\nme and I found myself unable to recall\nwho they were, smack-down it would\nnot be. However, deleting someone you\nsee regularly is dangerous. I was once\ndeleted by a (now ex-) colleague who\nhad not bothered to check who she was\ndeleting. The awkwardness on her part\nwas delicious, though no apology was\nforthcoming. I have not re-added her,\nnor have I accepted a friend request\nG\nreatness is overrated.\nBeing awesome, epic,\nor whichever other adjective you want to use\nto describe superior-ity, is not worth it. It\u2019s too much effort,\nspurred by exaggerated accounts of\nothers who will fail to recognize your\nachievements. We\u2019ve spent our entire\nlives being indoctrinated to aim high\nand attempt to emulate great people, to\nreach success in any way we can measure it. Whether you want to be a skilled\nscientist, a powerful politician or a respected artist, you have to work hard for\na long time and invest a lot of resources\nto achieve your goals.\nAnd for what? Immortality? Wealth?\nWhat are you exactly going for? Do you\nwant to become the next Churchill, the\nnext Newton, the next Picasso? Good\nluck with that. The Nobel prize is widely regarded as the highest achievement\nin the fields it rewards; and yet, how\nmany winners can you recall apart from\nthe obvious ones? Hundreds have been\nawarded the prize, but most are only remembered by specialists in their sector\nand Wikipedia articles.\nBut even if you do manage to become\nthe next Big Thing, eternal glory is not\nsomething you\u2019ll achieve. Even if your\nname goes down in history along with\nthe other great ones, there will be a day\nwhen all of what you have achieved is\nas relevant as the professional life of\nthe gas station attendant down the road..\nNothing lasts forever, if I\u2019m allowed a\nclich\u00e9, and the human race makes no\nexception.\nDo you do it for the wealth and benefits that greatness entails? Maybe I\u2019m\nspeaking only for myself, but I worked\nhard at school to get into a good univer-sity, where I\u2019m working even harder to\nget a good PhD placement, where I\u2019ll\nwork to get a good job, where difficulty\nwill go hand-in-hand with achievement,\nand so on. We live in a society that rewards hard work with the possibility of\nmore, harder work. Any material gains\nare mostly accidental, and always conditional on your ability to keep up with\nthe fruits of your labour. If you have\na magnum opus, any future effort will\nalways be overshadowed by your previous one; if you\u2019re establishing an excellent track record, you\u2019re setting ever\nincreasing high standards for yourself,\nand you can\u2019t afford to slip.\nBesides, who said that you\u2019re going\nto succeed? There\u2019s always someone\nbetter than you, and this is true for all\nbut one person on earth. If you think\nthat your skills alone are going to carry\nyou to the top, you\u2019re probably mistak-en. You\u2019ll need a healthy dose of luck,\nwhich is, by definition, uncontrollable.\nKnowing the right people, being at the\nright place, catching the right opportu-nity. How much of this can you influ-ence? \u201cMaking your own luck\u201d is all\nwell and dandy, but after a certain point\nfate might just be ignoring you.\nYou keep working harder and you\nget all the lucky breaks, and you finally\nmake it to whatever personal parameter\nof greatness you have. Now you can\nwallow in your awesomeness as you\nare barely rewarded for the monumental quantities of effort you put into it,\ncarefully avoiding the fact that it will,\ninevitably, amount to nothing. Was it\nworth it?\nSo I urge you, be lazy. Be satisfied\nwith your simplicity. Be average. Be me-diocre. Ignore your potential for great-ness, and be one in the amorphous mob\nof society. Pleasure yourself with vicarious joy, be it in the so-called achievement of eleven strangers on a football\npitch or the foibles of self-proclaimed\ncelebrities. Never mind that you\u2019d be\nlittle more than an animal with some in-tellect, caving in to your basest desires!\nNever mind that there\u2019d be nothing to\ndistinguish you from virtually any other\nhuman being on the planet! Be medio-cre, for it\u2019s too hard to be great.\nSurprise! A funding gap has\nemerged in universities. If you\nwere in charge of estimating\nhow many universities would\nask for as much money as\nhumanly possible and you predicted less than 100%, I feel\nlike you have only yourself to\nblame.\nSo many universities are\ncharging the full \u00a39000 that\nthe loans system is going to\nimplode under the weight of\nall the stupidity that was involved in bringing this about,\nand the only options available\nare really appealing things\nlike reducing university places or just cutting funding in.\nHooray!\nNUS president Aaron Porter\nsaid some words to a man\nwith a microphone, as per\nusual, but I\u2019m beginning to\nwonder if a Harry Potter lookalike is the best representative here. Not sure if that\u2019s\nsending the right message.\nNot that the message is being heard by anyone. Obviously, no-one gives a shit about\nwhat the National Union of\nStudents thinks because it\u2019s\nreally only one step up from\na Year 7 Student Council.\nBut if the best we\u2019re going to\nget on BBC News is \u201cthese\npoorly conceived funding arrangements blah blah yawn\u201d\nthen yes, we need a change\nof tack.\nSo what I\u2019m thinking is that\nwe club together and start up\na militant wing of the NUS.\nWe\u2019ll do all the cool militant\nwing stuff like pixelate our\nfaces when we go on the\nnews, and claim responsibility for any errors found in ex-ams, that sort of thing. Then\nthe next time someone wants\na comment about where it\nall went wrong, we\u2019ll say we\nwarned them and then laugh\nmanically while Aaron Porter\nclaims he has nothing to do\nwith us.\nAgain, no-one\u2019s going to listen to us. But if our university\nis going down the drain, a\ncareer in white-collar terrorism is a neat horizontal step\non the career ladder from\ndisgruntled student. Viva la\nrevolucion.\nAngry Geek\nWho wants to\nget militant\nwith me?\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n22\nhangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 10 june 2011\nHangman\u2019s Finest College News Source\nthe turnip\nTime travellers revealing exam answers \u2013 but\nnot to arseholes, twats, or Medics...\nDepartments across the College have reported\nunusually high average marks in exams taken\nsince 19th May, when boffins in the Physics\ndepartment confirmed that they now have a\nfully-functioning time machine that goes back\nas well as forward in time. All attempts up to\nthis point have left volunteers stranded in random points in the future, lumbered with having to explain to friends why their hair grew 5\ninches overnight and tracking down their other\nselves to challenge them to a duel, Highlander-style. This also accounts for the numerous\nsightings of students acting as if they don\u2019t\nhave exams to revise for.\nAll evidence points towards students using\nthe time machine to obtain the exam papers\nwith solutions in advance, avoiding the obvious route of obtaining next week\u2019s lottery\nnumbers or stock market data because Imperial students aren\u2019t renowned for their common\nsense. Alarm bells first rang when invigilators\nnoticed that everyone in the Modelling in Biology exam finished within 45 minutes, apart\nfrom one student who has no friends at all and\nevidently was left out of the loop. Examiners\u2019\nsuspicions were confirmed when it came to assessing their answer booklets, which contained\nnot only the full solutions but also various\nspelling mistakes and in some cases even the\naccompanying footnotes such as \u201cThese are\nthe marks the examiner anticipates giving\u201d.\nNot to be outdone, various examiners disgruntled by the fact that the impossibly hard\nexams they\u2019ve set have just been undermined,\nare considering using the time machine to\nchange the paper set, resulting in an endless\nback-and-forth battle until the space-time continuum finally has enough of their bullshit and\ncollapses into a singularity.\nHave you ever wondered exactly how fit you\nare? Have you ever thought that your Facebook stalking is unfocused? Have you ever\nwanted to know if you were the more attractive\nmember in the couple?\nWith FitFinder having, like a super hero\nwith the power of superspeed and premature\nejaculation problems, come and very swiftly\ngone, the website with the word fit in the name\nwas roughly like Imogen Thomas\u2019 legs \u2013 wide\nopen.\nIf the answer to any of the questions in the\nfirst paragraph were yes, then we have a revolution for you. It\u2019s called fitsort. Unlike FitFinder,\neveryone at Imperial is automatically applicable\nto be on it. Basically it\u2019s where you do what you\ndo in the pub with mates, but via the Internet.\nYou rate all of the girls and guys you know. Except the twist is that it\u2019s a one-on-one situation.\nIt\u2019s a bit like a boxing match, if a boxing match\nconsisted of two peoples\u2019 poser profile pictures\nput side by side and the audience rating them.\nThis can cause some David vs. Goliath situa-tions. Usually occurring when someone you\nknew from school who now goes to Durham is\nup against someone you met at Imperial.\nResults are shown in the form of a bps (bang-able points system). Then you get your friends\nlist all ranked from hottest to decidedly nottest.\nA lot of people have been worried about pri-vacy, seeing as it\u2019s an opt out system. To be\nhonest, fuck privacy, who cares about that shit\nwhen you can instantly know how (un)attrac-tive you are.\nObviously this isn\u2019t going to help revision\nin any way, as you will constantly be checking it waiting for the moment when your stats\nchange. This will most likely end up in spending the entire night sulking as you haven\u2019t got\nthe win to lose ratio you deserve. I mean come\non, you have long hair in a side parting, what\nthe fuck else do these people look for in a guy?\nThe most interesting thing is when you spot\na large disproportion in a couple. Pointing this\nout to the couple is obviously the way to go.\nI\u2019ve found it can only strengthen a relationship if one of them knows that they have been\npunching above their weight.\nIf fitsort isn\u2019t exciting you as much as you\nthought it would, there\u2019s always sexymp.com.\nThis is where mps go head to head in a contest\nto see which one you\u2019d rather force legislation\nthrough. Then the MPs are ranked in order of\nhotness. There are obviously some problems\nwith the system. For example, Eric Pickles is\nnot actually last. So we can only assume Eric\nPickles goes on there everyday to vote for\nhimself.\nAre you fitter than your MP?\nAn artist\u2019s impression of what he wishes the time machine looked like. What\nwe all wish it looked like\nDRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK\nSend your photos to felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nAs the former head of the IMF will tell you,\nasking for permission, is a good idea.\nHANGMAN\nSpoilt for choice. Look at that blue steel. Oh baby I want you to reform my system\nMedics said to be angry\nand drunk...\nThis week Editor Kadhim Shubber was able to announce exclusively, via Felix\u2019s Facebook and Twitter feeds, that Colin Firth would be at Imperial. The\nexposure meant he had to pull out, and not in the\ngood way \u2013 or so Kadhim says. The excuse given has\nbeen that \u201cdue to the uncertainty principle; the more\nI knew about one thing the less I knew about another.\nAlso I was trying to get the record for most likes and\nretweets on a single post.\u201d\nThis week he has upped the ante, and told us that\nScarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley will be filming\na nude lesbian scene on campus. Apparently they will\nalso be filming an orgy scene and need \u2018horny male\nstudents\u2019 to act as extras. It has been reported that\nthey decided to film at Imperial as horny male students would be in plentiful supply. Applicants should\nturn up on the day wearing geek chic (so basically\nwhatever you usually wear.) Hangman has been informed that the extras \u2018will not need to be able to\ndifferentiate\u2019 and so even Medics can take part. Although as it is exam season Medics are likely to start\nreciting anatomy, completely ruining the mood.\nStudents at Imperial were so excited to see a Hollywood movie star that they almost stopped revis-ing. One student was overheard saying: \u201cUnless it\u2019s\nfilmed in the library and contains scenes that include\ndetailed mathematical explanations of Quantum Mechanics I\u2019m not interested.\u201d\nIt has been suggested that it will just be body doubles and minor characters. However, this is being announced in the fourth paragraph, as it\u2019s more fun to\nget your hopes up. Kadhim has defended his decision\nto release the news before knowing whether or not it\nwas bullshit by saying \u201cHey, even if you\u2019re just a body\ndouble for Scarlett Johansson you are likely to still\nbe fuckable\u201d. The Physics department has refused to\nconfirm or deny that the body doubles will be \u201cdefinite\neights, borderline nines\u201d.\nIt is thought that angry Imperial students will protest\nby picking up Felix, flicking straight to the centrefold,\nscanning for talent, and when they inevitably find\nnone, reading the horoscopes and throwing it away.\nAs this is the way that most people indulge in Felix it\nmay prove hard to perform the reverse operation of\nintegration (differentiate \u2013 keeping you on your toes,\nyou guys have exams to revise for) between protestors\nand innocent students. Although innocent bystander\nand vicious protestor is a distinction that the police\nnever bother making, and if it\u2019s good enough for them\nit\u2019s good enough for anyone.\nWe here at Hangman believe that the Felix Editor\nshould be held accountable, and needs to be deposed immediately. Reports suggest his stranglehold\nover the Facebook page has become unworkable. The\nother day he was even seen wearing a military uni-form, contemplating growing a moustache, insiting he\nis referred to as \u2018General\u2019, and calling Sepp Blatter a\n\u201cgood man, with a kind heart\u201d.\nH A N G M A N\nMultiple movie stars will\nDEFINITELY be at Imperial\n\n"

The most spectacular of\nwildlife will populate the land, seas and\nskies but will not harm a single person.\nMeanwhile, people will be free to engage\nin deep philosophy, charismatic sports-play and, a weakness of your own, a\nlibrary with all the books there ever was\nand ever will be \u2013 with no late fines. This\ncreation will be populated by all your,\nno, their loved ones and there will be no\nageing, pain or death.\nIt is a good start, you admit, but, if it\nwere you, you might be a bit disappointed.\nIt still feels a bit uptight, a bit stuffy, for\nParadise. You bite your lip and add a few\nfootnotes. Women will be irresistibly hot,\nwith none of their earthly inhibitions or\npreferences \u2013 the men too! And while pain\nwill be gone, pleasure will be multiplied a\nthousand-fold. The most blinding orgasm\non earth will be like a faint tickle in this\nHeaven. As your grip on morality loosens\nfurther, you decree that people will be able\nto do what they like with absolutely no\nconsequences. All the things they wanted\nto do on Earth but were too scared to, and\nmuch more besides.\nYou are not struck by a thought but two\nat once. First, if Heaven grants people\ntrue freedom and they use that freedom\nto do bad things, is that really Heaven? Or\nmerely some ghastly parody? Secondly,\nthis bliss is supposed to be for your\nworst enemy. You have no idea what you\nyourself might be getting \u2013 there is no\nguarantee you will get anything anywhere\nnear this nice. Why should he get a better\nafterlife than you, you argue jealously.\nYour vision of Utopia is consigned to the\nbin and you begin again.\nYou are not certain who your worst\nenemy is but there is no way he deserves\nbetter than you, so you begin to rein in\nyour largesse. You imagine something a\nlot like Earth but only a bit nicer. Traffic\nlights will go his way, and people will\ngenerally like him. He will not win the\nlottery but he will not catch any nasty\ndiseases either. You think of a particularly\ngood day you had when you were alive.\nHe shall have an eternity of them.\nBut that is not fair, you realise. Clearly,\nyour worst enemy is a bit of a prick \u2013\notherwise, he would not be your enemy. Is\nit Bartridge from the office who had never\nliked you since your first day? That guy at\nthe pub who always resents your help on\nthe quiz machines? The playground bully\nwho probably lived the rest of his life\nin nameless frustration? It could be any\none of them and none of them deserve a\ngood day, let alone a lifetime of them if\nthey are just going to be mean and ornery\nto everyone they meet. Another potential\nhereafter scrapped.\nYou are a good person, or so you\nbelieve, so your worst enemy must be\nbad. So, if they did not receive any\njustice for their crimes on Earth, you\nwill make sure they get it now. You\ngrin malevolently as thunder rolls and\nlightning strikes over jagged mountain-scapes. Sulphurous fumes billow into the\nblack air from raging fires that will never\ndie. These will be bonfires, funeral pyres\nfor everyone and everything your enemy\nhas ever loved. Even his memories will\nburn. His family will burn last, just after\nthe last of his favourite books has turned\nto ash (you hope he can appreciate the\nhorror of book-burning \u2013 to you, it is\nan abomination). But that is only the\nstart; mental, emotional, physical \u2013 he\nwill be tortured without limit. Flesh\nstripped from bone, haunted by monsters\ngrotesque and barbarous, every feeling he\never felt twisted and betrayed \u2013 he will\nsuffer without end, you declare with no\nsmall amount of glee. And here is the best\npart, you note down, when he is finished,\ncompletely spent, dried up to the husk\nwith pain and anguish, it will start all over\nagain, repeating until time itself dies.\nYousitbackwithafeelingof satisfaction.\nIt is cruel, yes, maleficent, definitely, but\nyou convince yourself that this is what\nyour worst enemy deserves. Though their\nnature and identity still remain a mystery to\nyou, he must be your enemy for a reason.\nConfident that this is the final draft, you\nrise and search for John.\nHe is standing by a door \u2013 a fire escape?\n\u2013 in the corner of the room. It is filled\nwith a myriad of cubicles much like your\nown, unending, with people beavering\naway at a thousand different versions of\nElysium and Gehenna. As he sees you,\nJohn checks his watch.\n\u201cI didn't expect you to finish so soon.\u201d\nhe remarks, faintly impressed, \u201cwell, let's\nhave a look at it, shall we?\u201d\nYouhandhimthefinishedblueprintand\nhe examines it. He frowns to begin with\nbut says nothing as his eyes scan over it.\nYou feel the seconds tick by intolerably as\nhe silently critiques your work. He pauses\nonce or twice for clarification on some of\nthe finer points. You sigh, relieved, when\nhe finally nods and rolls it up.\n\u201cVery good. It's not my cup of tea but\nit will do. Are you sure this is what your\nown worst enemy deserves?\u201d he asks.\nYou nod with not a trace of doubt. \u201cFair\n\"If Heaven grants\npeople true\nfreedom and they\nuse that freedom\nto do bad things,\nis that really\nHeaven?\"\nOpposite: by Roc\u00edo Molina\nAbove: by Michael Sahyoun\n\n"

Becoming Real, is one of\nthe most promising young\nproducers around today,\ngiving birth to strange new\nmusic that tends to melt faces and scar\nminds. It also turns out he\u2019s a really nice\ndude. He answered a few questions of\nmine in anticipation of his headlining\nset at BONED, the second Felix Music Night, taking place this Saturday at\nMetric (Imperial College Union).\nHow would you describe your music\nfor readers who might not have heard\nof you?\nEski / Footwurk / House.\nIn interviews, you seem to refer to Becoming Real in the third person, implying that you as an artist separate\nyourself from the music you\u2019re pro-ducing. Do you have any other current projects, musical or otherwise?\nYeah we, there is me and Becoming\nReal, we ain\u2019t the same person. I\u2019m just\nthe guy that makes the music, he\u2019s the\nentity. Just doing Becoming Real right\nnow, that\u2019s my main project. I do loads\nof filming and walking, I have kinda\nlike a team of people who I\u2019m creative\nwith, but musically it\u2019s just me myself\nand I.\nAny plans for a full-length album?\nNot right now. I\u2019ve pondered it, but I\u2019m\nFuture sounds at BONED\nGreg Power talks to Becoming Real about his music, collaborations, future projects\nand Samurai movies in anticipation of his headlining set at BONED this Saturday\nbusy working on other shit: two EP\u2019s,\ncouple films. Full-length is gonna have\nto wait.\nDo you think that the album just\nwouldn\u2019t work as a format for Becoming Real?\nI\u2019ll make it work for me I guess. It\u2019s\njust a blank CD I gotta fill with music\nso I\u2019ll just do my own thing, but yeah it\ncertainly ain\u2019t gonna be some 12 track\ndance compilation. Fuck that. All I\nknow is it\u2019ll be epic.\nI really dig the tracks you did with\nTrim, as his voice and flow really\nmatch your music in an interesting\nway, in a similar way to how Kode9\nand Spaceape complement each oth-er. Do you plan on working with Trim\nagain?\nTrimbal, yeah, maybe in the future.\nWe\u2019ll see. I\u2019m giving the straight up\ngrime ting a rest right now.\nAre you interested in working with\nother vocalists, and not necessarily\ngrime artists?\nMaybe. I used to think some R\u2019n\u2019B\nthing would be cool, but seriously, fuck\nthat. I don\u2019t wanna be some guy who\u2019s\ngot some American chick over the top\nof my stuff. I\u2019m British, my music is\ninformed by what\u2019s around me. I love\nR\u2019n\u2019B and all that, but really, I ain\u2019t on\nthat bandwagon, if you feel me...\nYou are an Imperial student. Your brain\nand body require intense stimulation.\nThanks to exams, you now have free\ntime and money, are still in the vicinity of Metric, and are dying \u2013 craving,\npraying \u2013 for a chance to have your jiv-ing, drunken body pounded with bass-heavy, cutting-edge dance music. Your\nprayers have been answered. This Saturday, I\u2019ll be running the gamut from\ngarage and dubstep to full-on neo-rave\nfrenzy, dropping in 8-bit chipstep treats\nthroughout.\nChipstep is something of a fondness\nof mine, you see \u2013 it\u2019s the nostalgic love\nchild of old-school video games and\nmodern dance music, and my production focus. Remember how abrasive and\ngritty those games used to sound? Our\ntop bass scientists have harnessed its\nplutonium-like power and are now putting it to use manufacturing weapons of\nmass booty destruction.\nChipstep encompasses any dance music with a retro game flavour, from remixes of old game music to tunes that\nmerely incorporate the characteristic\nbloops, razzes and buzzes. In my tracks,\nthis works particularly well for genres\nlike bassweight dubstep and electro,\nwhere a raw, primitively digital sound\nis what\u2019s needed. The target audience is\nemerging just about now \u2013 we\u2019re looking to get into clubs and listen to serious\ndance music, and we\u2019re older than the\nnew generation that won\u2019t say \u201caha!\u201d\nwhen they hear \u201cha!-ha\u201d. I\u2019ve noticed\na little chip influence in a lot of recent\ndance music releases now, and some\nbig names have gone all out and made\nproper chipstep releases, a notable one\nbeing Bop - The Amazing Adventures Of\nOne Curious Pixel.\nPromoting the good cause is a night\ncalled Nintendisco, for whom I\u2019m an\noccasional DJ. These guys run monthly\nevents where you can come on down to\n93 Feet East in Brick Lane for a combo\n\u2018Bloops, Razzes and Buzzes\u2019: DJ Niceberg on his neo-rave madness\nWilliam Berg\nWhat would be your dream collabo-ration? You can pick anyone, living\nor dead.\nHmm, I could get Dizzee back on track.\nI recently heard your remix of \u201cKissing You\u201d on The FADER Soundcloud,\nwhich is hypnotic and eerily soothing,\nand really quite different from the\nmore visceral material you play at\nyour live shows. Are you more interested in pushing sonic experimentation than writing songs?\nYeah, this a good point. I certainly started off by just pushing sounds and seeing what I could make with my cheap\nass equipment, how far could I reach or\nwhere could I stretch my equipment and\ntools to. But nowadays I\u2019m just trying\nto make otherworldy dance music, music that\u2019s been remembered incorrectly.\nI want them to be left with something\nafterwards to make people time travel\nwhen they come see me live, I guess...\ndurr.\nYour ghost-step has its roots in grime\nand dubstep, but could you see yourself moving away from dance music\naltogether?\nI was never really into dubstep to be\nhonest, grime and footwurk for sure.\nAnd I think there\u2019s always been traces\nof house, more and more that\u2019s coming\nto the forefront actually... I\u2019m doing my\nbest to make dance music come closer\nto me, to inject my set of sounds and\nprocesses with more swing and that.\nI find that there\u2019s a real cinematic\nquality to your music, in the way\nit evokes images of dark, desolate\nback-alleys and seedy city under-bellies. What with Trent Reznor\u2019s\nOscar for The Social Network\nsoundtrack, the Chemical Brothers\u2019\nHanna soundtrack and the awesome\nsoundtrack Basement Jaxx wrote for\nAttack The Block, it seems like the\nsoundtrack is becoming an increasingly attractive way of getting your\nmusic out there, reaching crowds outside of club nights, whilst remaining\nan artistically challenging endeavour.\nHave you ever thought about doing a\nsoundtrack?\nYeah man, I\u2019d love to do a soundtrack.\nI\u2019d like to make a sound track to places\nin London, or make a soundtrack to my\nmemories of places I\u2019ve been.\nWhat are you listening to these days?\nAny recommendations?\nYeah, the new Anti-G record on Planet\nMu is the shit. Seriously awesome. A\nlot of older stuff on Kompact... Kassem\nMosse is pretty good. I\u2019m working on a\nremix for him right now.\nFinally, I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re quite\nthe samurai movie geek. I would like\nyou to tell us about your favourite\nsamurai movie.\nYeah sure. I like \u2018The Bride With White\nHair\u2019. It\u2019s a bit more comical, but it\u2019s\nincredibly well edited. Any Akira Kurosawa is a sure fire classic, the texture\nof his films are so silky... Been watching\nThe Kingdom recently though \u2013 the Lars\nVon Trier series. I\u2019d recomend that also.\nCome see Becoming Real at BONED\non Saturday 11th (that\u2019s tomorrow!)\nBecoming Real is next level dance\nmusic for the cybersoul\nChip music characteristically involves the coolest fucking set-ups ever\nevening of SNES and boogying. Do you\nget better or worse at Street Fighter with\na couple of pints in you? Come along\nand find out. This comes especially recommended for those of you who need a\nfun pre-lash or who don\u2019t go for longer\nnights, as it starts and ends relatively\nearly.\nIf you want to learn more about anything I\u2019ve mentioned here, just search\nSoundCloud, where you\u2019ll find my artist page, the chipstep group and Nintendisco\u2019s mixtapes, among other things.\nCheck out Niceberg\u2019s sick chiptun-age on soundcloud.com/dj_nice-berg.\nCome support Niceberg and the\nrest of the Imperial musicians performing at BONED, the second Felix\nMusic Night, this Saturday at Metric.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 9\nSCIENCE\nFriday 10 june 2011\nEver find sex horribly disappointing?\nFinding it difficult to get those teenage\nkicks? If it\u2019s any consolation, according to a recent study from the School of\nPublic Health, you are not alone.\nThe rather raunchy study probed\n15,000 young adults on their previous 7\nyears of sexual activities and ratings of\ntheir sexual enjoyment. For many, recalling so many sexual exploits may be a\nstruggle, but it would seem rating pleasure was another matter. Remarkably,\n87% of men compared to 47% of women\nreported to having orgasms most of the\ntime. This shocking disparity might be\ninterpreted as a lack of male performance\nbut perhaps the real issues lie with the female psyche. In the study, regularity of\nfemale orgasms and sexual enjoyment\nwas linked to three psychological fac-tors: autonomy, self esteem and empathy.\nAutonomy is the ability to follow personal convictions, even if this means\ngoing against social norms and is supposed to represent sexual explora-tion. Self esteem, on the other hand is\nthe sense of self worth and is aligned\nwith the ability to communicate sexual\npreferences. Finally, empathy is linked\nto understanding the partner\u2019s needs\nand knowing how to satisfy them. It is\nthought this empathy may then inspire\nthe partner to return this \u201cfavour\u201d.\nUnsurprisingly, it was shown that\nwomen score higher on empathy but\nlower on self esteem compared to men.\nThe co-author of the study Adena Galinsky said \u201cthese developmental assets\nmay be more important to young women\u2019s sexual pleasure since they help them\nbreak down impediments to sexual communication and exploration\u201d. So maybe\nit\u2019s time to take the pressure away from\nmale sexual performance and work on\nfemale confidence for a change.\nPoor performance, or low self-confidence?\nKatie Tomlinson\nIt\u2019s ok, I\u2019m sure Colin Firth will visit Imperial one day...\nLow self esteem may\nhinder sex life\nEYFastTracks\nApply in July andget ahead faster\nApplications for 2012 Ernst & Young Internships and Placements open on July 1st\nwith opportunities in Advisory, Assurance, Corporate Finance and Tax.\nAct now and you could sort out your plans for 2012 before the university year begins.\nFind out more and apply at www.ey.com/uk/eyfasttracks\n\u00a9 Ernst & Young 2011.

You will never see them again.\nYou turn to John, \u201cIs this Heaven?\u201d\nA thought dawns on you and you gulp\nharder, \u201cor is this Hell?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone always asks that as well.\u201d\nJohn rolls his eyes. He sighs, before\nshrugging \u2013 might as well get on with it,\n\u201cThis is neither Heaven nor Hell...for you\nat least. Your final destination is currently\nin design. We would have had it ready on\ntime but we didn't know you'd be joining\nus so soon. While you wait, you can help\nus by designing the afterlife for your\nworst enemy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why? Why me? Why my worst\nenemy?\u201d your mind floods with questions\nand the dam of your mouth cannot hold\nthem back. You did not even know you\nhad a worst enemy but that thought\nremains unvoiced.\n\u201cWe like to personalise eternity, to\nprovide custom-fit endlessness the\ndiscerning consciousness.\u201d John explains.\nYou see now the group manager pin\non his collar and the precise architect's\ncreases around his eyes and forehead. \u201cAs\nfor your worst enemy, they died recently\nas well and we can't think of anyone who\nknows what they deserve.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d you ask, rapidly\nacclimatising to the rather bizarre next\nchapter of your existence. The revelation\nthat there is an afterlife is eclipsed by the\nrevelation that your long-forgotten GCSE\nin Design and Materials will actually be of\nsome use at last.\n\u201cWe will provide you with pens and\npaper.\u201d John the manager explains as he\nlays down rolls of blue schematic paper\non your desk. You did not see them when\nhe came in but your mind seems very\nat ease with spatial abnormalities at the\nmoment. \u201cTake as long as you want. Call\nme when you're finished or if you have\nany questions.\u201d\nWith that, he exits the cubicle and\nleaves you to it. At first, the task seems\noverwhelming. An entire afterlife?

    "content": "her mother have similar falls many times over\nthe years; it had been a normal occurrence,\nthat is, until she had resigned herself to her\nbed. Sophie had no disease to blame for this\naccident, however, and no mother to console\nher. And so, with a determined grimace, she\npicked herself up, gathered the scattered debris\nand hobbled back into the kitchen.\nReturning to the corridor to clean up the\nmess, she reached for the light switch \u2013 for\nnow it was almost completely dark \u2013 and, as\nshe flicked the switch, the light bulb above her\nhead flickered violently for a second and then\nextinguished. The wiring in this old house was\nin tatters; every other day there was something\nshort circuiting on Sophie, or at least it seemed\nthat way.\nThe ceilings in their Victorian house were\nunusually high, and Sophie was quite short\nfor her age. Normally, changing a light bulb\nwould have been in the realms of dad-territory,\njust like mowing the lawn or accompanying\nmum to the hospital had been. Circumstances,\nhowever, have the frustrating ability to change\non you with very little notice. Dad was no\nlonger here and so, once again, the burden\nwould have to fall on her. There were no\nspare bulbs in the house and she couldn\u2019t\nreally be bothered to run to the shops to get\nmore. She had already replaced two bulbs this\nweek, and money was pretty tight these days\nanyway. Her father\u2019s cheques might come as\nregular as clockwork, but they were small, and\ncould barely meet the household\u2019s monthly\nobligations, certainly not any frivolous\nexpenses like reliable artificial illumination.\nWandering into the kitchen, she walked over\nto the windowsill and turned the radio up\nagain.Sophielikedtheradio,itwascomforting;\na character always ready to entertain her when\nshe was bored, a presence to accompany her\nwhen she was lonely. Her father, many years\nago now, had explained how it worked. How\nelectromagnetic waves could, invisibly, carry a\nvoice, uttered hundreds of miles away, through\nthe air to be decoded by this small box on the\nwindow sill. It was fascinating. And, moreover,\nhow these radio waves were made of the same\nthing as light, so even in the darkest room one\nmight be illuminated by the soft, comforting\nvoice of a stranger.\nShe looked up from the radio, staring outside\nat the deserted road. The streetlamps had\nbegun to light now; the sodium glow turning\nthe landscape monotonous and flat, like an\nold sepia photograph. Standing on her toes\nand straining her neck, she could just see the\nentrance to the dusty strip of land, supposedly\na garden, shared by the estate. She could see,\nvery faintly, a young child with its mother on\nthe swing set, a rusting monument to the slow\npassage of time. It was barely useable these\ndays, but despite its dilapidated frame, the two\nlooked happy, together.\nSophie turned away, and collapsed into one\nof the rickety kitchen chairs. With her head\nin her hands, she closed her eyes and tried to\nimagine what it was like before she had been\nreduced to this state of simple servitude. Was\nthere even a time when she was happy, she\ncouldn\u2019t be sure, it had been so long. Looking\nafter her mother was all Sophie did now,\nwhether it was fetching prescriptions from\nthe chemists, walking her to the bathroom,\nor changing the sheets if she couldn\u2019t help her\nin time. There was hardly any time for herself\nanymore. Of course she knew she had to be\nthere, no one else was going to do the hard\nwork. And on a good day, she was happy to do\nit; after all, her mother had done pretty much\nthe same things for her. But today \u2013 Sophie\nexhaled \u2013 today she just didn\u2019t have the energy.\nA bit ironic, she thought, as this was exactly\nwhat mum had been fighting for decades. She\nhad first gone to the doctors over 20 years ago,\ncomplaining that she felt like she had just ran a\nmarathon, only this feeling would not go away.\nSophie found it hard to imagine what it must\nfeel like to find out that lethargy, something\neveryone feels from time to time, could be a\nportent of such a devastating future.\nLater on, when Sophie had accompanied\nher mother on one of her frequent hospital\nvisits, a doctor had tried to explain exactly\nwhat was happening, and what was going to\nhappen. The doctors said they didn\u2019t quite\nknow what caused the condition, only that it\nwas partly genetic, and that because her mum\nhad it, she was quite likely to get it. And if\nshe did \u2013 God forbid \u2013 it probably wouldn\u2019t\nstart to show for a fair few years. Something\nto look forward to, she thought cynically; the\nslow, painful transformation into the relic that\nnow inhabited the small bedroom upstairs.\nIt had taken 23 years for her mother to self\ndestruct into her current state; for her own\nbody to slowly destroy her very essence, her\npersonality, her very being. How long would\nSophie last?\nEnough time to start a family perhaps? She\ndidn\u2019t even have time enough for a boyfriend\nas it was, if you could call Adam that. When\nwas the last time they had seen each other? She\ncouldn\u2019t remember. All she knew was that it\nwasn\u2019t fair, so many opportunities missed, so\nmany chances taken away.\nHow much time she had passed in that\nsolitary doze, Sophie didn\u2019t know, but by\nthe time she had come to her senses, it was\ncompletely dark. The radio in the corner was\nsoftly murmuring to itself once again, a voice\ncontent to be heard, but never truly listened\nto. Sophie sympathised: whenever she would\nexplain her problems to someone they would\ngive all the signs of real human concern, but\nshe knew they would forget just as soon as\nSophie was out of sight. It was a tragic situation,\ncertainly, but not life threatening quite yet.\nShe was sure that, when the time came, she\nwould be inundated by offers of support, but\nat present she was stuck in a torturous state of\nlimbo; and Sophie was at once dreading and\ndesiring the end to come.\nThere wasn\u2019t much point starting dinner\nnow, her mother wouldn\u2019t eat this late, and\nbesides Sophie wasn\u2019t that hungry any more.\nShe picked up the radio, extinguished the\nremaining lights in the house and climbed the\nstairs for bed. Passing her mother\u2019s door, she\npaused \u2013 just to listen. No cries could be heard\nnow, just her slightly laboured breathing.\nShe carried on to her bedroom, closing the\ndoor behind her. Placing the radio on her\nbedside table, she undressed and got into\nbed. Without looking, she reached out and\ndetuned the radio to static, the white noise\nbetween stations that was not one thing or\nthe other, and could drown out all other\nsensations. With an empty mind, she drifted\ninto a dreamless sleep, a carefree expression\ndescending on her features \u2013 one that would\nnever be seen.\nOpposite: by\nRafael Benitez-Cabral\nAbove: by Jane Seok\n\n"

    "content": "5\nFELIX Friday 10 june 2011\nFEATURE\nAn eloquent\nspokesperson\nfor science\nKadhim Shubber\nmeets CaSE director\nand Imperial\nalumnus\nImran Khan\nI\n\u2019m standing outside the offices\nfor the Campaign for Science and\nEngineering (CaSE) on Gordon\nSquare, near Euston Square tube\nstation, trying to stop sweating\n(summer showers tricked me into wearing a coat...) when I notice something.\nWhile our university recently took the\ncontroversial, and in my opinion fool-ish, decision to cut ties with CaSE, their\noffices are actually situated in an UCL\nbuilding. Our closest London competitor\nembraces this influential lobby group,\n\u201cputs their money where their mouth is\u201d\nas UCL vice-provost David Price puts it,\nand we do the exact opposite. I\u2019m not\nsure whether to be surprised or not.\nOnce I\u2019ve cooled myself down, I go inside and I\u2019m buzzed through into CaSE\u2019s\nmodest office. The two rooms seem to\nperfectly capture a sense of \u2018punching\nabove your weight\u2019. CaSE is an organisation that has successfully lobbied the\ngovernment at the highest levels, spearheaded national campaigns, and won\nfront page headlines on major national\nnewspapers; and all from an office that\u2019s\na little smaller than the Union bar.\nImran Khan, the director of CaSE, rath-ershinesinthissmallspace.Policypapers\nare stacked around his office, and there is\na heap of placards from the Science is Vital campaign, which helped spare science\nfunding from the worst of the cuts back\nin October, stacked up against one of the\nwalls. He\u2019s extremely well spoken, possessing the rare ability to speak quickly\nin properly constructed sentences without\n\u2018umming\u2019 and \u2018ahhing\u2019, and also disarm-ingly charismatic \u2013 not characteristics\nthat one would immediately associate\nwith an Imperial alumnus.\nHe studied on Imperial\u2019s Science\nCommunication masters course in\n2007/08 and during his time at Imperial,\nwrote articles for Felix and had a couple\nof shows on IC Radio. Gareth Mitchell,\nwho lectures on broadcast and written\njournalism on the course, remembers\nhim as enthusiastic, saying that he \u201creally threw himself into the course\u201d.\nHe calls Imran \u201can aspirational figure\u201d for students on the course today.\n\u201cEven though he is doing really well\nfor himself, he still comes back to\nImperial, to give seminars to our\nstudents, to give them direction and\nadvice,\u201d says Gareth, \u201che has had\na big impact by being a role model\nfor students interested in science policy\u201d.\nAs we start our interview it quickly\nbecomes apparent why. He has a deeply\ntechnical grasp of the issues affecting\nscience and engineering research in the\nUK, but also the skill to explain them\nin an easy-to-understand manner. Why\ndon\u2019t politicians \u2018get\u2019 that investment in\nscience is important, I ask him. He rejects my premise, \u201cI think that is a bit\nof a misapprehension. All the political\nparties understand that science and engineering is really important.\u201d But the real\nquestion, he says, is how important is it\nin relation to other challenges.\nA perfect example of this was shown\nthe Comprehensive Spending Review\n(CSR), where CaSE and others argued\nsuccessfully that research funding needed\nto be prioritised and protected, which it\nwas to an extent. Is rising inflation chipping away at the \u2018generous\u2019 10% cut\nthat we were given? Yes, he says, but\nhe also points to U.S. research that\nshows that inflation for some scientific research has often been higher than\ngeneral inflation, warning that we are\nstill yet to see \u201chow stringent these cuts\nare going to be.\u201d\nI ask him about the 50% cut to research capital expenditure, the \u2018sting\nin the tail\u2019 after the success in the CSR.\n\u201cYou had people saying \u2018oh we\u2019re fine\u2019\nand then reality hit.\u201d He says that the\nscience community has a job to do in\nnot only adapting to the cuts by sharing more, \u201cit\u2019s not like the old days, we\ncan\u2019t just compete against each other,\nthere\u2019s got to be a mixture of competition and collaboration\u201d, but also in convincing the government of the folly of\nthe capital expenditure cuts: \u201c[We\u2019ve\ngot to say] actually here\u2019s the impact of\nthese cuts, here\u2019s the world class reser-ach that\u2019s not being done, here are the\nworld-class scientists that we\u2019re losing\nto Singapore or the States because they\ncan afford the equipment that we can\u2019t.\u201d\nAlthough I\u2019m enjoying his careful deconstruction of the research landscape,\nwe both know that the reason that I\u2019m\nthere is to discuss Imperial\u2019s decision\nto leave CaSE. Given the the successes\nthat scientists have won since the last\nGeneral Election, but also the huge\nchallenges that we continue to face, it\nseems a peculiar time for Imperial to be\ndisengaging from the science community in this way. Does he think Imperial\ncan speak for itself, I ask him.\n\u201cAll institutions will want to speak for\nthemselves. UCL are very kind in that\nthey\u2019re not only members, but they also\nhouse us here. However, it\u2019s not as if all\ntheir science lobbying comes through\nCaSE,\u201d he says. But Imperial doesn\u2019t operate in a vacuum, he goes on to argue:\n\u201cWhat [Imperial does] impacts of the rest\nof the community, and what the rest of the\ncommunity does impacts on Imperial.\u201d\nThe only other institution to end its\nsubscription to CaSE since the last\nGeneral Election is the British Library,\nwhich given their financial problems\nImran says \u201che would have been astonished if they had stayed on.\u201d Imperial on the other hand recently emerged\nfrom its \u2018phoney war\u2019, so called by the\nformer Chief Operating Officer Dr Martin Knight because it had come through\nthe financial crisis with a \u00a340 million\nsurplus. During the same period, around\n20 new members have joined CaSE. \u201cI\nthink if you just look at those numbers,\n20 new members vs. one drop out excluding the British Library...\u201d says Imran, who pauses before adding, \u201c[The\ndecision] surprises me.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no resentment or anger towards\nImperial, however. This is partly pragma-tism, \u201cWe\u2019re a tiny organisation, we can\u2019t\nafford to stick our noses up at Imperial\u201d,\nbut also a focus on what is important. Of\ncourse CaSE will still need to engage\nwith Imperial, and Imperial staff and\nresearchers, even if it isn\u2019t as straightforward now \u2013 \u201dyou can\u2019t do anything related to science communication or science\npolicy in London without dealing with\nImperial at some point,\u201d he told me on\nthe phone before the interview.\nAnd of course there\u2019s the personal\nconnection to Imperial. He remembers\nbeing part of a very close-knit department and says that he loved being close\nto the Science Museum and the V&A.\nHe speaks very highly of the Science\nCommunication and Science Media\nProduction courses, saying that they are\n\u201ca real training ground for science communication policy professionals.\u201d\nWhen I met his former lecturer Gareth\nMitchell, he was setting up the IC Radio\nstudio for his current students, much in\nthe same way that he would have done\nfor Imran when he was here. He says\nthat he finds students initially start out\nwith a strong interest in the media side\nof science communication, but more and\nmore get drawn towards the policy side,\ntowards directly improving the state of\nscience through influencing govern-ment, and other institutions\u2019 decisions.\nHe says that Imran followed a similar\npath. It\u2019s obvious when you meet Imran\nthat he could have had a go on the media\nside, he\u2019s got the charisma for it.\nBut when you hear the passion that\nhe\u2019s got for the work that he does, I\u2019m\nhappy that, in the nicest possible way,\nhe\u2019s not on our TV screens. It\u2019s while\nwe\u2019re talking about whether Imperial\ncan lobby on its own. He points to the\nCaSE\u2019s work during the \u2018Science is Vital\u2019 campaign: \u201cIt\u2019s not a scientific ex-periment, we can\u2019t run it again and say\nhere\u2019s the difference that we made, but\nwhat we can say is that we left no stone\nunturned. Everything that we could do,\nwe did. We lobbied everyone from the\nPrime Minister down. We lobbied civil\nservants, journalists, the research com-munity, people on the streets. People\nwho weren\u2019t scientists turned up [to\nprotest] to make sure that the UK [con-tinues] to lead the world in research.\u201d\nHe adds, \u201cOf course that will have\nall benefited Imperial, I hope,\u201d but I\ndon\u2019t pick him up on what could be the\nunderstatement of the year.\n.\npin\ni\ng\ns\nar\nsea\nin\n\u201cYo\nand\nsci\nt\nCaSE\u2019s letter, published in The\nTimes and signed by eight Nobel\nlaureates, helped to influence the\ngovernment\u2019s migrant cap policy\nCharles Poon\n\n"

The latest iteration\nbrings many features available on competing platforms to Apple devices. Notable among them are\niMessage, a BBM-style messaging utility, an Androidesque notification capability and update over-the-air\nwhich should allow you to update your phone without\nhaving to plug it in to a desktop. Don\u2019t hold on to any\nhopes of showing off to your Android and Blackberry\ntoting friends in the near future though - the update\nis only going to be pushed to users in the fall. Apple\nwill no doubt do a solid job in bringing their excellent\ninterface design skills to the fore, but the update\nseems to be a small step rather than a giant stride.\nWait for the iPhone 5 for bigger and better things.\nFacebook has apologised after yet another priva-cy-related furore this week. This time the uproar\nrevolved around their roll-out of facial recognition\nfeatures meant for use in tagging photographs. The\nbiggest complaint about the new feature centred\naround the fact that it was opt-out and not opt-in:\npeople were startled to discover that Facebook could\nnow recognise their friends and family without having subscribed to such a service in the first place. In\nFacebook\u2019s defense, the technology was merely suggesting possible tags for photos from your friends\nlist and not tagging them automatically, using data it\nalways has had access to. The intention behind the\nrelease seems to have been harmless, yet the implementation bears Facebook\u2019s usual heavy-handed-ness. It\u2019s clear that Zuckerburg and co. have some\nwork to do before they win anyone over with their PR.\nFacebook in privacy row (again...)\nLaunched in London last month was a new\nonline game called Chromaroma. The game is\nplayed on the London transport network and\nutilises your Oyster travel card to gain information regarding your commuting. Players\ncan get points by many different actions but\neach swipe of your card contributes to your\nteam\u2019s tally. You can go on personal missions\nto set record times between stations or venture\nto parts of London that you might not have visited before.\nThe developers of the game describe is as a\n\u201ctype of location-based top-trumps. You collect places, identities, modes of transport and\npassengers as you travel around the city; discover and investigate mysteries attached to\ndifferent locations and build alliances with fellow passengers that share your journeys. It\u2019s\na game you can play on your own, or part of\na team.\u201d\nIt sounds like an initiative by TFL to coerce\nthe weary Londoner into increasing their Oyster card usage and decrease their bank account\nfunds but it\u2019s actually a new interactive form\nof gaming that has been taken up very quickly.\nMost games of this nature would require you\nto use your GPS smartphone to \u2018check-in\u2019 at\ncertain locations (like Foursquare) but this\ngame is based entirely online allowing anyone\nwho owns an Oyster card or a Boris Bike key\nto get involved.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a bank, if you deposit money then\nyou have the right to remove it and count it. If\nyou create data then you have the right to take\nit out and look at it\u201d says Toby Barnes who\u2019s\nresponsible for the development of the game.\nIt\u2019s the data that\u2019s the fascinating part of the\ngame and the biggest reason to sign up is to\nsee your journeys round London visualised in\nan interesting and engaging way.\nThe exciting part of the game arises when\nyou align yourself with a certain group and\ntry to take over stations. The game revolves in\n\u2018seasons\u2019 (lasting a few months each) and the\nteam with the most swipes of the season has\nownership of that particular station. The busier\nstations: Victoria, Waterloo, Liverpool Street\netc. all seem to change hands daily which\nopens up the game.\nThe data used does raise some ethical questions about tracking people\u2019s whereabouts and\ncreating a log of everywhere you\u2019ve been. The\ngame designers, Mudlark, get around this with\na forty eight hour delay on your information\nbeing updated online. This does seem to remove some of the immediacy of the game as\nyou can\u2019t always remember your whereabouts\ntwo days previous and if you\u2019re involved in a\nvicious battle to takeover your home station\nthen you\u2019ll want to see your results straight\naway.\nBut it\u2019s not all about rushing between stations to secure more points and records. The\norganisers say that they are looking to introduce new features to the game which might\ngive you more points for getting off one stop\nearly and walking. Using the Boris Bikes currently scores you points but you may be rewarded with more points if you switch from\nthe underground to the bikes. Mudlark are\nalso considering sponsorship opportunities\nwhich would give users discounts to services\nalong their favourite routes and players with\nmore points might receive special offers from\ncompanies.\nIt\u2019s well worth a try, the visuals will keep\nyou enticed more than anything else although\nI\u2019m not sure the game has enough to keep people coming back for months.\nThe game best played on the move\nWindows 8 preview promises app bonanza\nAfter weeks of speculation and leaks regarding\nthe next version of Microsoft\u2019s flagship soft-ware, Windows 8 was previewed this week at\nthe Computex Expo.\nMost striking about the new operating system was the user interface, which has dropped\nthe traditional Start menu and desktop combination in favour of a Windows Phone 7 style\ntile layout. The interface has won plaudits\nfrom many reviewers of their mobile devices\nand Microsoft has obviously attempted to\nchannel this into their desktop software.\nThe OS is very touch-oriented, having obviously been designed keeping tablet compat-Jake Lea-Wilson\nFeroz Salam ibility in mind. With ARM based Windows 8\ntablets on preview as well, it\u2019s clear that the\ncompany is betting on demand for touch technologies at least equalling the market for devices with physical keyboards.\nThe preview revealed very little about\nchanges under the hood, however. While the\nmajority of new programs (or \u2018apps\u2019 as we\u2019re\nnow meant to call them) will be designed for\nthe new interface, all the traditional programs\ncan still be opened in the old interface should\nyou require it.\nMicrosoft should be commended for making their first truly bold move in years, but it\nremains to see if their stodgy but vital business\nclientele appreciates it as much as they should.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 21\nTRAVEL\nTravelEditor: Chris Richardson\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 10 JUNE 2011\nTrekking to Machu Picchu\nC\nusco (or Qosqo in the native Quechua) is the historic capital of the Inca\nEmpire in South-Eastern\nPeru. It consists of windy\ncobbled streets, black whorled iron\nfences, spacious plazas, expansive and\nluxurious fountains, ceramic plant pots\nand is home to a constant whisper of\n\u201cInca Trail Senorita?\u201d floating the grin-go-way. Reaching the Plaza D\u2019Armas\n(the central square) you are mobbed by\nPeruvian companies trying to get you to\npurchase their specific trail, \u201chow much\nchica?\u201d to the awe-inspiring Inca palace\nof legends, cloaked in mythology, sitting high above the clouds, the mystical\nand enigmatic \u2018Machu Picchu.\u2019\nWe booked an \u2018Inca Jungle Trail\u2019, an\nalternative route to the historic trek taken by many travellers, in which they beat\nthrough jungle to reach the \u2018doorway to\nthe sun\u2019 spying in the sunrise, the first\nview of this UNESCO world heritage\nsite, a smattering of stonework aligned\nin a vast array of doorways, windows,\nouter frameworks of temples and houses\nfor Inca royalty. Our route took us over\na disused railway track, past waterfalls,\nhot water springs, a hydroelectric power\nplant and several kilometres of bumpy\nground before arriving at the base of our\nmuch anticipated end-point.\nOur first day involved jumping on\nto racing bikes and freewheeling our\nway down 3000 feet of Andean moun-tain-side. At the very top the wind was\nharsh, whistling through our jackets as\nwe bent round corners. The \u2018peloton\u2019\nstarted pedalling together as a line, then\nbundled closer as a pack with finally a\nfew adrenaline-seekers bursting free\nfrom the ranks to speed down the circular asphalt road, with a spectacular drop\ndown to the lakes and hills below and\nbefore us. Several travellers suffered the\nconsequences of this reluctance to use\nthe brakes with one girl careering off\nher bicycle to graze her chin, and one\nSpanish man landing on his arm in a\nditch. However, we were lucky enough\nto spin through the waterfalls, across\nthe bumps, glide past the villages on the\nPriya Garg takes the \u2018Inca Jungle Trail\u2019 route to this iconic site\nway and race up to the finish line a few\nhours later. Our efforts were rewarded\nwith a meal of warm empanadas (local\npastry) and slices of gateau as we rested\nupon a sacrificial Inca mount, rolling\ngreen hills in front of a sheer blue sky\ncradling us in a circular fashion.\nThe next day involved the unglam-orous (walk seems the wrong word to\nuse for this gruelling march) trek over\nrough terrain in the searing heat to\nreach our second lodge at the base of\nMachu Picchu. Sixty minutes hanging\nin a hammock, and three minutes being pulled over the tempestuous waters\nof a rough lake on a pulley-bridge provided a welcome respite to the cushions\nof blisters padding my feet as I arrived\nseven hours after we started, limping to\nthe town where we would set off for one\nof the wonders of the world. The words\n\u20183am wakeup call\u2019were not music to my\nears. Brutally, that hour of the morning\narrived all too soon, and hauling ourselves out of bed, we trudged towards\nthe bridge where at 5am the Peruvian\ndoors would officially swing open for\nus to begin our ascent to Machu Picchu. Flashlights, trekking pants, energy\nbars, hiking poles and sun-cream galore,\na scrum formed to charge up the thousands of slippery steps.\nPuffing and panting through the\nflora and fauna as the mountains arose\naround us, the clouds quickly disappearing from far above us, to below us, and\nthe oxygen levels thinning with every\nstep, we finally made it, all 1480 ft, to\nthe official entry to the ruins of Machu\nPicchu after fifty minutes of hill climb-ing. \u201cBloody steps\u201d (or something\nless polite) was the general consensus.\nRather than a momentous sprint to see\nthe magnificence of the sights that we\nwere to behold, it was more of a 6am\nstagger up to the entry of citadel, as llamas picked at the grass, and bus-loads\nof tourists appeared, clean and fresh to\nthe world, as if to taunt our weary and\nsorry state.\nHowever, as the first few travellers\nhanded their tickets in, we were rewarded with a view of terraced fields,\nsoaring luscious green peaks and a me-tropolis, a labyrinth of tiny stone hous-es, coming together to form a dramatic\nand astonishing view of Inca life, evoking the grandeur of a lost empire from\ncenturies ago. As Becky made the horrific climb up a neighbouring mountain,\n\u2018Waynapicchu\u2019, the local Inca meeting\npoint for the high priest and the chosen virgin sacrifices to the God of the\nSun, I nursed my feet and sat at the\ntopmost viewpoint on the peak itself,\nthe \u2018Guardian\u2019s Hut\u2019, watching as thousands of tiny people milled their way up\nand down the steps, awe-struck at the\nmagic of this now defunct and absent\ncity, imagining its sounds, scents and\ncolours.\nIn summary, it was an honour, an en-chanting, unbelievable, inspiring, stupendous sight. But, Machu Picchu, you\nwere a real bitch to get to...\nLeft to right, the route to Machu Picchu: Cross a river (the Peruvian way), cross some abandoned rail tracks, take a left at the sheep, and voila!

I\u2019ve just mopped up and I\u2019m\nnot having you making a right old\nmullock of the place. Not after last\ntime. I don\u2019t know how you did it but\nyou got bits of skin and guts all over\nmy nice clean floor. Picking shrivelled\nup pieces out from behind the cooker\nfor days after, I was. It\u2019ll attract rats,\nyou see if it don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAh, quit your bellyaching woman,\nit\u2019s a beautiful day, I\u2019ll cut it up in the\nyard. Got that nice new workbench\nset up there. This\u2019ll be a good time to\nmake use of it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I hate seeing them wriggle\naround like that. Wouldn\u2019t it be\nkinder to just put it out of its misery?\nYou could do it when you make the\ncatch. Save you the bother of having\nto keep it alive all the way back.\u201d\n\u201cOh love, you know it\u2019s best if it\u2019s\ncooked as fresh as possible. A rub\ndown all over with the grater to get\nrid of the skin, rub in some salt, a\nquick gutting with the fillet knife to\nget rid of them nasty insides, then\npop it in the oven. I\u2019ve got it so I\u2019m\nright quick now. The last one were\nstill moving around when it went in,\nand it were the best tasting meal I can\nremember. When it comes time to\neat, meat\u2019s meat, no matter what it\u2019s\nfeeled.\u201d He paused from his flow, and\nsome sympathy came into his voice.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch if you don\u2019t\nwant to, duck.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think I will. It\u2019s the only\ntime I get to see you do any work,\nyou messing about with your catch.\nThe window\u2019s right above the sink\nanyway, and those dishes aren\u2019t going\nto do themselves.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be quick love. You\u2019ll see. You\nput the oven on soon as you see me\nget back.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me how to run my\nown kitchen, Tom. Now be off with\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be off. Don\u2019t forget to work\nup an appetite. Them as eats most\npudding gets most meat.\u201d\nWhile he said this, the old man\nshrugged on his jacket, and crammed\nthe bait into the inside rabbit pocket.\nThen he picked up the fishing rod\nwith one hand, a car key from a\ncracked cow-creamer with the other,\nand walked out of the door.\nThe day was even warmer than it had\nseemed from inside the house, and the\nold man immediately knew that he was\ngoing to be too hot with the jacket on.\nThe thought suddenly came into his\nhead of undressing in the yard while\ncleaning the catch. One of the benefits\nof having a house out in the country:\nno nosey neighbours for miles around\nto look over into your yard. He\u2019d take\nhis clothes off and pose for her like\nhe sometimes did before they went to\nbed. Wouldn\u2019t she be surprised! And\nthe catch too of course. He chuckled\nat the thought. His jacket was a\nmedium green tweed, with matching\nwaistcoat, brown flannel trousers, blue\nbow tie, and grey flat cap completing\nthe rest of his ensemble. When he\nwas young he\u2019d worked down at one\nof the steel mills like most of the\nmen his age, and none of them would\nhave countenanced walking around\noutside without a hat and jacket. Now,\nthough many years had passed, he\nsaw no reason to change, certainly not\nbecause everybody else had. The old\nman worked as a security guard at the\nshopping mall in the city now, and it\nhorrified him to see the things grown\nmen walked around wearing: crumpled\ncotton T-shirts that looked like the sort\nof things they\u2019d sleep in. No respect,\nthat\u2019s what it was. Children grew up\nnot being taught any respect, and\nwhen they got to be adults they\u2019d no\nrespect then either. He\u2019d been working\nas a guard for fifteen years now. He\nwas a few years past retirement age,\nbut he was a good worker who knew\nevery inch of the shopping mall inside\nout, he could spot a shoplifter just\nfrom the way they walked through the\nstores, and he was a valuable source\nof experience to the younger security\nguards. The management knew this,\nand were happy to keep him on as\nlong as he wanted to stay. For his part\nhe enjoyed walking around all day. It\nkept him fit and healthy, even though\nhim and his wife ate a lot these days.\nThe fat settled on her, but he stayed\nlean and wiry. He\u2019d gained a lot of\nmuscle from shifting metal around\nthe steel mill for over twenty years\nin his youth, and even now he was\nstronger than many men half his age.\nThe bow tie and waistcoat he wore on\nweekends, to make a change from the\nnavy suit and tie he wore at the mall all\nweek. He didn\u2019t have much of chin, so\nhis neck seemed to stretch up to his\nmouth. Combined with a loose dewlap\nand pronounced Adam\u2019s apple, this\nleft him bearing a slight resemblance\nto a turkey.\nHe walked round to the side of the\nhouse, where his white Honda was\nparked up, and a minute later he was\ndriving carefully along the macadam\ntrack, before pulling onto the tarmac\nof the main road and speeding away\nacross the dales.\nHe drove for upwards of thirty-five miles before coming to a river.\nIt wasn\u2019t the nearest river, but one\nthat was perfect for fishing, and one\nthat he hadn\u2019t visited before. He\nnever liked to fish in the same place\ntwice. A small track led off from the\nmain road, roughly parallel to the\nriver margin, and he drove along this\nslowly, looking for a likely spot.\nWhen he had found the spot he\nwanted, the old man parked the car\nunder the shade of a clump of trees\na little further along, then took the\nfishing rod off the front seat next\nto him, and walked over towards the\nriver. For about a ten metre distance\nalong a bend in the river, the bank\nwas free from bushes and trees. One\nof those places along rivers kept clear\nby the regular attentions of anglers,\nbut today, the only angling was being\ndone by a young boy. The day was\nso good, that the middle-aged men\nwho make up the bulk of anglers had\nbeen press-ganged into picnics and\noutings with their wives and children,\nleaving only those with no family\nresponsibilities free: the young boy,\nand now, the old man.\nThe young boy was about ten years\nold, with lank blond hair down to\nhis shoulders. He obviously didn\u2019t\nsee the point of hairdressers and\nhis parents saw no reason to force\nhim to go too regularly. He had a\nsnub nose and blue eyes that were\npresently surmounted by a furrowed\nbrow as he concentrated on the point\nwhere his fishing line dropped down\ninto the water, willing a fish to take\na bite. He started with surprise when\nthe old man sat down next to him,\nbut was quickly distracted by envy\nfor the old man\u2019s fishing rod, which\nwas an expensive new one, gleaming\nsilver and outshining the boy\u2019s own\ncheap red rod that he had saved up\nhis pocket money to buy.\n\u201cNice day,\u201d said the old man.\n\u201cGood to meet a fellow member of\nthe noble angling community.\u201d\nThe boy grunted and returned to\nconcentrating on his fishing line. He\nhad caught one small roach so far,\nbut that had been over forty minutes\nago, and he was beginning to feel\nfrustrated. This was his first fishing\ntrip, and he\u2019d imagined himself astride\nthe bank, flicking his line into the river,\nand reeling out dozens of fat carp.\nAfter the initial excitement of his first\ncatch, the reality was disappointing,\nand now he felt that he hadn\u2019t a chance\nof catching another now that the old\nman had arrived with his superior rod\nthat would be obviously preferable to\nany passing fish.\nThe old man reached into his\njacket\u2019s rabbit pocket, searching for\nthe bait. For one moment he thought\nWhen it comes\ntime to eat, meat\u2019s\nmeat, no matter\nwhat it\u2019s feeled\n\u201c\nOne of the benefits\nof having a\nhouse out in the\ncountry: no nosey\nneighbours for\nmiles around\n\u201c\nhe\u2019d forgotten it, but then his fingers\nclosed around it, and he drew it\nout. The boy saw the man take it\nout from the corner of his eye, and\nimmediately whipped his head round.\nClutched in the old man\u2019s hand was\nthe very latest handheld PlayStation\ngames console.\n\u201cIs that a PSP Go?\u201d the boy said,\nhis eyes widening.\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know the name, but\nit\u2019s the latest model. You can have a\ngo if you like.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d said the boy, snatching\nthe console from the man\u2019s proffered\nhand and starting to press on the\nbuttons. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought\nsomeone like you would have one of\nthese.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone so old you mean?\u201d\n\u201cNo offence, mister.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken, young sir. Enjoy\nbeing young while you can. This\nbelongs to my grandson. He\u2019s up\nat my car now. He\u2019ll probably join\nus once he\u2019s stopped sulking about\ngoing on a fishing trip. Wanted to\nstay cooped up in the car playing\nwith that thing, but I said, no, you can\nplay those pocket games any day you\nwant, but going fishing on a day like\nthis is something that comes around\nonce in a month of Sundays, and I\u2019m\ntaking this electronic nonsense with\nme. Do you enjoy the game?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Bit boring, though. Just one\nof those card-collecting games, you\nknow.\u201d\n\u201cTell you what. My grandson\u2019s got\na heap more games over in the car.\nLot of those fighting games with lots\nof blood in them. You like those?\nWell, come and pick out whatever\nyou want, and we\u2019ll see if we can\u2019t\nget my grandson to come down and\nfish with us. I dare say a young man\nlike yourself will have a much better\nchance of persuading him than me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll come. I could help him\nfish if he\u2019s not done it before.\u201d\nThe boy leaped to his feet and\nstarted jogging towards the direction\nthe old man indicated. The old man\nkept pace behind him, walking quickly,\nand taking his fishing rod with him.\nPhotos by Zoltan Varga\n\n"

The\ncollaborative website is built upon the\nsame technology behind Wikipedia.\nIt\u2019s fully integrated into the Imperial\nsystem, such as logins and email alerts,\nand by using open-source software, the\nwhole thing hasn\u2019t cost the department\na penny.\nSince its launch in November, the\nsite has amassed hundreds of pages of\ncrowd-sourced lecture notes and past\nexam paper solutions. As well as allowing students to easily download mate-rial, they are able to make their own\nchanges and improvements too. An\nonline forum has been used by students\nto share helpful hints and to help coordinate the bidding for MSci projects.\nStudents seemed to agree that the\nwiki was transformative to the way they\nstudied. This has been most evident in\nthe third-year \u2018comprehensive\u2019 exams.\nThird year physics student John Selby\nsaid, \u201cThe third year comprehensive exams are a nightmare, I don\u2019t know what\nI would have done if I didn\u2019t have the\nwiki\u201d. The comprehensive exams page\non the wiki has received over 14,000\nviews and features annotations of past\npaper questions as well as summary\nnotes that have been produced by students in the department.\nDeep believes that the wiki will grow\nas a resource and become an invaluable resource for physics students in\nthe coming years. \u201cEvery year students\nspend loads of time making notes, collating information, doing past papers,\nand trolling the web for information. Yet\nas soon as the year is over all this information just disappears into the ether.\nI always wondered why we didn\u2019t have\na central place where we could collect\neverything so every student would not\nhave to repeat the work each year.\u201d\nDeep is excited about how quickly the\nwiki has taken off and has pushed for a\nsimilar solution to be rolled out across\nCollege. \u201cThe vast majority of students\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDeepka Rana\nPhysics students create\npopular revision \u2018wiki\u2019\nUnion could join CaSE\nPresident \u2018discussing possibility\u2019 of affiliating\nafter College decision to leave\nLife Sciences head Ian Owens to take\nup post at Natural History Museum\nThe Union has criticised the College\u2019s\ndecision to cut ties with the science\nlobby group CaSE, calling the decision\n\u201ccynical\u201d and suggesting that the Union\nitself could affiliate with the group in-dependently.\nIn a statement to Felix, later posted\nonline, Union President Alex Kendall\npraised the Campaign for Science and\nEngineering (CaSE) and said that the\nUnion was \u201cgrateful\u201d for the work it had\ndone to support science research funding and to promote a \u201cpositive portrayal\nof science in the media.\u201d He said that he\nwas \u201cdiscussing the possibility\u201d of the\nUnion joining CaSE so that the students\nof Imperial would still be represented\nby \u201cthe main lobby group for science\nand engineering.\u201d\nCaSE is regarded as having a pivotal\nrole in the government\u2019s decision to\nfreeze and ring-fence the science research budget after the Comprehensive\nSpending Review, instead of cutting it\nin cash terms. It also led a campaign to\nwin a generous settlement on immigration for researchers, meaning that although there is a cap on the total number\nof migrants, researchers are favoured\nsignificantly over other applicants.\nAlex Kendall said that Imperial\u2019s decision to \u201cditch\u201d CaSE after the hard\nwork they had done for the science\ncommunity in the UK was a \u201cvery cynical move\u201d that would \u201cdamage the unity\nneeded to present a single voice on science and engineering funding.\u201d\nIt is currently unclear as to whether\nthe Union will be able to affiliate with\nCaSE. In an interview with Felix,\nCaSE director Imran Khan said that the\nUnion\u2019s gesture was \u201cvery appreciated\u201d\nand that it was \u201chumbling\u201d that students\nwished to support CaSE. However, he\nwas hesitant of setting a precedent of\nStudent Unions affiliating instead of\ntheir parent universities. He said that\nthey were still considering whether such\na model could be sustainable as student\nunions. He was unable to shed any further light on Imperial\u2019s decision, saying\nthat there were no personal disagreements that he was aware of and that all\nof the feedback, prior to the decision,\nin the department regularly use the wiki\nand a growing number of students are\nbeginning to contribute their own con-tent. Over 700 students have registered\nto use the wiki and the site was receiving in excess of 1,500 page views a day\nduring the exam period. I hope the website will continue to grow as a resource.\nWe\u2019re currently working with Alex Dahinten to give the wiki some additional\nbacking and to roll it out a similar solution to the rest of college.\u201d\nDeputy President of Education Alex\nDahinten had nothing short of praise for\nthe wiki. \u201cThe Physics Wiki has been\none of the really outstanding initiatives\nthought of by reps this year. A great\nthing about the Physics Wiki is how it\nis student run. Although staff members\ncan access it and contribute, the day-to-day running is done by selfless students\nwho wish to get others to interact online\nabout their learning.\u201d\nKin-Hing added, \u201cIn the future, we envision that the department could move\nto a wiki system for lecture notes and\nlab scripts. This would allow students\nto add their own improvements such as\nlinks to useful resources or alternative\nways of deriving a solution to a prob-lem. Lecturers would play an important\nrole in producing the basic content and\nmoderating the page but I feel this could\nmake undergraduate teaching a more\ninteractive experience for both parties.\u201d\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies\nProf. Angus McKinnon said that the\nPhysics department is supportive of the\ninitiative but is \u201cslightly nervous about\nunforeseen circumstances\u201d which could\narise \u2013 in particular the challenge of ensuring coursework problems are not too\nsimilar to those which have been set in\nthe past and for which solutions may\nbe available on the wiki. \u201cIn a subject\nlike Physics, where coursework tends\nto involve solving mathematical prob-lems, the effect is very different from\nanother subject in which coursework\nconsists mainly of essay writing. You\ncan feed an essay through \u2018turnitin\u2019 (a\nprogramme to detect plagiarism) but not\na solution to a physics problem.\u201d\nThe Imperial Physics Wiki can be\nfound at rcsu.org.uk/physoc/wiki/.\nWebsite is \u201coutstanding\u201d says\nUnion Deputy President\nPolice appeal for Royal Albert Hall death witnesses\nOn the 23rd of May, a ten-year-old\nboy was hit and killed by a coach\noutside the Royal Albert Hall.

Professor\nDavid Begg, Principal of the Business\nSchool, has stood in since the departure\nof Sir Peter Knight from the position\nlast autumn. When the Times Higher\nEducation supplement first reported\nImperial\u2019s decision to cut ties, they\npointedly referenced Imperial\u2019s Prorector situation. A reporter for the Times\nHigher Education, told Felix that it was\nunclear whether the reshuffle had anything to do with the decision, but added\nthat he understood that the reluctance\nto renew membership came \u201cright from\nthe very top.\u201d\nThe College did not add anything\nnew to their previous statement, which\nexplained that they felt the \u00a33,000 subscription could be better directed to\n\u201ccore activities\u201d, except to indicate that\nthe decision was taken \u201ccollectively\u201d\nand that it was up entirely up to the\nUnion if it wanted to affiliate or not.\nKadhim Shubber\nProfessor Ian Owens, the current head\nof the Department of Life Sciences, has\nbeen announced as the Natural History\nMuseum\u2019s new Director of Science.\nIn his new role, Professor Owens will\nbe responsible for setting the strategic\ndirection of its scientific activities and\ntaking responsibility for the collections\nof over 70 million scientific specimens\nfrom around the world.\nProfessor Owens attracted controversy earlier this year for his role in the\nthe restructure of Life Sciences. The\nrestructure faced fierce opposition and\nprotests from the Union and students.\nThe Natural History Museum has expressed its \u201cdelight\u201d at Owens\u2019 appoint-ment, remarking that, \u201cIan\u2019s leadership\nwill give our progress greater momentum.\u201d\nUnion President Alex Kendall wished\nProfessor Owens well in his new job\nand acknowledged that despite their\ndifferences in the past year, \u201c[Professor\nOwens] remained courteous and polite\nthroughout, where others may have not.\u201d\nProfessor Maggie Dallman, Head of\nthe Faculty of Natural Sciences, wishes\n\u201cwarm congratulations\u201d towards Professor Owens, adding that, \u201cthanks to\nhis careful and professional leadership,\nthe Department of Life Sciences is in an\nexcellent position to grow and develop.\u201d\nResponding to his appointment, Professor Owens has highlighted the connection between the College and the\nMuseum.\n\u201cIn my new role I hope to strengthen\nthe relationship between Imperial and\nthe Museum\u2026working together I hope\nwe can do even more to inspire the public and tackle major challenges in natural sciences.\u201d\nProfessor Owens, who has served as\nHead of Department since 2007, is expected to embark on his new appointment in the autumn while maintaining\naffiliation with the College. The selection process for his successor is ongo-ing.\nMatt Colvin\nNatural History Museum\n\n"

The news\ncomes with just a week to go until this\nyear\u2019s Ball, which features headliners\nLaura Marling and Ian Brown.\nThe Union\u2019s plans for the future include further collaborations with other\nuniversities, building on this year\u2019s joint\ninvolvement of King\u2019s and Goldsmiths.\nThe Union say that they have \u201can expression of interest\u201d for collaboration next\nyear with UCL.

    "content": "FELIX 13\nPOLITICS\nPolitics Editors: Rory Fenton\nJoseph Letts\nRajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 10 JUNE 2011\n\u201cWe win or we die\u201d\nThe \u201cArab Spring\u201d has changed the Middle\nEastern map beyond recognition. Sparking\noff in Tunisia, after a fruit vendor set himself\nalight in protest at the way he was treated by\nthe police, protests have spread like wildfire\nthrough Algeria, Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, Libya, and Syria.Although each country is unique,\nall these protests point towards the discontent\nand dissatisfaction many Arabs feel after living most, if not all, their lives under the same\ndictatorial, autocratic, and oppressive regimes.\nFor many political analysts the uprising in\nSyria, which started on the 15th of March,\nwas a huge surprise. The Syrian regime is one\nof the most oppressive regimes in the Middle\nEast and the people knew that any rebellion\nwould be met with brutal force.\nRuling since 1963, the Baath party came to\npower through a military coup and quickly\nplaced Syria under emergency law. This took\naway the Syrian people\u2019s human rights and\nruthlessly protected the position of the ruling\nBaath party. Hafez Al-Assad, father of the current president Bashar, took over through another military coup in 1970. He started his reign\nby clearing the scene of any perceived threats\nto him. During the late 1970s, when the Syrian\npeople rebelled against his rule, they were met\nwith vicious attacks to control them and keep\norder. However, things began to get out of control and his brother Rifaat destroyed the city of\nHama in 1982 during an army operation which\nkilled over 40,000 people. Hafez, driven by the\nfear he installed in the Syrian people, wanted\nto make himself the ultimate and eternal ruler\nof Syria. Statues and pictures appeared all over\nSyria and children were made to chant slogans\nat schools. By the time of his death in 2000,\nHafez had killed, imprisoned, and expelled\nhundreds of thousands of Syrians and left\nthose who survived scarred for life.\nMany people thought Bashar Al-Assad\nwould be different to his father, having lived\nand studied in London. But it fast became apparent that he was truly his father\u2019s son. Although he began opening Syria up to the world\nthis was done for financial gain, which is\nevident looking at the ownership of all major\ntechnological, oil and trading companies.\nSeeing the effects of the revolutions across\nthe Middle East installed a sense of hope in the\nSyrian people. This led a few children, all under 11 years of age, to paint anti-government\nslogans on walls in the city of Deraa. They\nwere all arrested and spray cans were made\nillegal by the government. The parents of\nthe children went to ask for their release but\nwere told to forget about them and make new\nchildren. Unsurprisingly this sparked protests\nacross the region, protests that were met with\nviolence from the Syrian security forces resulting in the death of many of the protesters.\nCities all over Syria, outraged at the killing\nof peaceful protesters, came out to protest in\nsupport of Deraa, but they too were repressed.\nDoma, a suburb of the capital Damascus was\nthe first area outside Deraa to feel the wrath\nof the security forces. They killed and injured\ndozens of its people and have had installed a\nlarge security presence there since.\nJust as they rose to support Deraa, the Syrian people rose again to support Doma. This\ntime Homs, Latakia and Banyas were the areas\nworst affected by the security crackdown. The\nmost shocking footage came out from Bayda, a\nvillage near Banyas, where the security forces\ngathered the men in the village square and began stepping on and humiliating them.\nAs ever, the more repressive the Syrian security forces became the more determined the\npeople became. The people of Homs rose to\ndefend the people of Deraa, Doma, Latakia,\nand Banyas. They were met with great oppression over three days, the last of which saw a\nlarge death toll, which led to a large open ended protest that turned bloody when the security\nforces attacked at 2 am on the 8th May. The\ndeath toll for that night is unknown as security\nforces took the bodies to hide their crimes.\nUnder pressure from the growing waves of\nprotests, the government began an army offensive on areas with heavy protests, this led\nto Deraa being placed under siege and anyone\ntrying to break it, even to supply people with\nfood, was killed. Other areas that have also experienced increasing military presence include\nHoms, Banyas and some of the suburbs of Damascus including Doma and Moudamya.\nHowever these plans, rather than scare people into submission, have made them more\ndetermined than ever to overthrow the re-gime. Which has led it to its final option- all\nout war on its own people. This led to military operations in Deraa, Banyas, Homs and its\nsurrounding towns, Hama, Jisr Al-Shogour in\nIdlib and many other cities, towns and villag-es. Mass graves are being discovered all over\nSyria and soldiers who refuse to obey orders to\nkill protesters are killed themselves by the cold\nblooded security forces. No one has escaped\nthe brutality of the security forces. However,\nthe most shocking and heartbreaking case is\nof the 13-year-old Hamza Al-Khatib who was\nkidnapped by security forces during a protest.\nA month later his body was handed back to his\nfamily, neck broken, knees shattered, penis\nsevered, body beaten badly and covered with\ncigarette burns. However, sadly he was not the\nonly case of torture among children.\nThese operations have fuelled the protests\nand helped them spread to areas which the\ngovernment thought were out of reach- the\ncentres of Damascus and Aleppo, the second\nlargest city in the country. Furthermore, the\nprotests that were once weekly are now a daily\noccurence.\nRather amusing in all of this, is the Syrian\nstate channels who have blamed these protests\non anyone but the government.

    "content": "In 1887 a humble undergraduate, studying at what would\nlater become Imperial College London, founded an arts\npublication called the Science Schools Journal. That\nstudent\u02bcs name was H. G. Wells, and he was to become one\nof the most celebrated writers of the twentieth century.\nToday, 65 years after Wells\u02bc death, his creation lives on,\nthough transformed beyond all recognition. The rather\nlacklustre title was soon abandoned in favour of something\nsnappier, and for more than 60 years The Phoenix served\nas the premier student publication on campus, until the\nestablishment of Felix in 1949.\nIn all those years, though, one thing never changed: every\nsingle piece published in Phoenix belongs to a college\nmember. The incredible popularity and longevity of the\npublication are a testament to the sheer volume of artistic\nactivity at Imperial.\nA huge number of clubs and societies, covering all forms\nof art, are to be found at Imperial. Lunchtime and evening\nconcerts run constantly. Nearly every week, it seems, the\nBlyth gallery is invaded by some intriguing new exhibition.\nWe truly are blessed by the range of events going on\naround College.\nWith all this in mind, we had high expectations when we\nbegan to receive submissions. We were not disappointed.\nThe quantity of moving, truly beautiful work received was\nstaggering, and in fact humbling. This publication would\nnot have been possible without the great talents and e\ufb00orts\nof all those who submitted their work.\nA great many of the contributions relate to the idea of\nfreedom. Allowing this common link to guide the process\nof production, we have divided the publication into three\ndistinct acts. Each act explores the concept of freedom\nfrom a di\ufb00erent perspective.\nWe hope you enjoy this year\u02bcs edition of Phoenix.\nPhoenix 2011\nActI\n04. attack from within\n06.

Sophie\ncontinued with her routine, putting the\nshopping away, unloading the dishes; making\nsure everything was in its rightful place.

She still had the whole of\nthe downstairs to vacuum before she could\neven start dinner and, with a small sigh,\ncrossed into the dimly lit corridor towards\nthe cupboard under the stairs. It took a while\nfor her eyes to adjust to the dark, and while\nshe was scrabbling to find the door handle,\nthe abrasive noise from upstairs registered\nagain. Realising she could no longer put off\ngoing to see her, and with no small measure\nof trepidation, she ascended the staircase and\ngently knocked on the door at the end of the\nlanding.\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d muttered Sophie, not\nreally wanting to be heard. A moment or two\npassed in silence before Sophie could gain the\ncourage to enter. The room was even darker\nthan downstairs; with only a faint corona of\nlight penetrating past the thick curtains.\nQuietly, she crossed the room towards the\nwindow and slowly drew open the curtains,\njust a small amount, to allow the now overcast\nday to filter through. Though the room\nbrightened only a fraction, it was enough to\ndisturb the hunched figure resting beneath the\ncovers on the bed. The figure coiled tighter,\nand let out a quiet murmur of disapproval, or\npossibly pain.\nSophie felt annoyed and, although she\ninstantly regretted the feeling, that small surge\nof adrenaline racing down her spine could not\nbe subdued. It had been this way for almost a\nyear now. She sat herself down at the end of\nthe old, iron bed, which juddered noticeably\nas she did so. A hand was protruding out\nslightly from beneath the sheets. Sophie had\nan overwhelming urge to grab the hand, to\nshake it violently even, to do anything to get\nher to react.

She\nhad spent too much time sitting here anyway;\nshe had more pressing things to do. Sophie\ncollected the used plates and mugs from the\nbedside table, and slipped out of the room. As\nshe closed the door behind her, she could hear\nher mother stirring once more. She had been\ngoing through another relapse for the past few\nweeks, and obviously, the pain was once again\ngetting too much for her.\nAs she rushed down the dark staircase, hands\nladen with the remnants of yesterday\u2019s meal,\nshe somehow lost her footing \u2013 stumbling\ndown the last three or four steps \u2013 collapsing\non the floor at the bottom.

    "content": "Mango and rice? It can only be Soho...\nFELIX\n20\nFOOD\nFood Editors: Dana Li\nVicky Jeyaprakash\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 10 JUNE 2011\nA r e you MADD?\nDana Li visits MADD, Soho\u2019s hottest caf\u00e9 and\nbrainchild of a Business School alumnus\nR\nupert Street. It\u2019s not exactly a street name that\nshouts out \u201cFood Mecca\u201d,\nsuch an honour usually\nreserved for the likes of\nBrick Lane, Old Street and Borough\nMarket. But think again. I visited Rupert Street, located in the centre of\nSoho, three times within a period of two\nor so weeks. Not for the X-rated sex\nshops as some would relate Soho to, but\nfor the relatively newly opened MADD,\na mango dessert caf\u00e9.\nThe brainchild of an Imperial alum-nus, Ralph Monthienvichienchai, its\ncreation was stemmed from an unwillingness to study a PhD and a passion\nfor mangoes. Of course, it isn\u2019t every\nday that an equation like that results in\nopening your own mango caf\u00e9 in the\nheart of Soho. A Masters degree from\nthe Business School may have put him\nin good stead for the theory behind busi-ness, but Ralph believed the only way to\nlearn was to get out there and take each\nhit and fall as they came.\nMADD initially opened back in February with little furore, preferring to test the\nwaters and taking time to listen to their\ncustomers. After renovation and ironing\nout the creases, MADD has had its foot\non the accelerator with recent articles in\nthe Evening Standard and more close to\nhome, in the Reporter attracting attention\nto the caf\u00e9. And the publicity definitely\nbears fruit, the weekend following the\nEvening Standard article, MADD was\nbursting with customers up until its midnight closing time on Friday and Saturday. Ralph also mentions a food blogger\nwho brings a fair share of his custom-ers, mostly students, who make it their\nmission to leave with a photo with the\ndashing young entrepreneur. It certainly\nwould be hilarity if all Imperial students\nBe honest now. You love this exam\nperiod. It\u2019s the ultimate trump card, a\nsuper-charged get-out-of-anything free\nexcuse accepted by everyone. Exercise?\nCan\u2019t, exams. Important favours? Can\u2019t,\nexams. Washing? Can\u2019t, exams.\nBut the best guilty self-persuasion is\na culinary one. Spending time cooking\neconomically sensible, easy-to-prepare\nlunches at home? Can\u2019t, exams. Eating\nout is the order of the day, and the South\nKensington station area is the place to\neat.\nSo how come everyone goes to Subway, when they could go to Chopstix?\nYou know, Chopstix? I would say \u201cit\u2019s\nthe Chinese place near to Little Japan\u201d,\nbut can\u2019t for two reasons: 1) I don\u2019t\nwant to blow their cover and start some\nYakuza/Triad turf wars in the genteel\nheart of London. But more importantly\nbecause 2) I don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s\nChinese. Especially because 50% of the\nchoice of dishes are called things like\nThai Red Curry or Malaysian Chicken.\nAnd the internet reliably informs me\nthat these are not actually boroughs of\nChina but whole separate countries! Seriously, I\u2019m not joking!\nSo I can only assume they call it Chopstix as a catch-all temptation for people\nfrom all Chopsticks-using countries.\nAnd of course for people like me who\nuse chopsticks to imagine themselves\nas a kung-fu master/wandering samurai/\nimpossibly trendy Japanese school-girl\nand so forth. A smart move, like calling\na restaurant Forx to appeal to all those\nsavages from outside the west who still\neat without them. I say \u2018the West\u2019, but\nof course do not include Obese America in that as everyone knows they\u2019ve\nevolved teeth between their fat rolls and\nnow just plough food straight into their\nabdomen.\nTo be fair, I can\u2019t talk. That is to say,\nI can\u2019t talk because I\u2019m eating, unlike\nthose guys who chat happily whilst their\nfat rolls munch away.\n\u2026Did someone say Fat Rolls? Then\nthey must be talking about Chopstix\nwhich has the fattest spring rolls allowed before they become Spring Logs.\nBut tasty as they are, they\u2019re just the\nside-show to the main courses.\nSure, they\u2019re probably not Authentic\nChinese Cuisine. They don\u2019t have delicious dumplings from Guangdong, or\ndelicate, crispy Peking duck. There is\nno Sichuan spice or the stretched ribbon\nnoodles of the people of Uighur. There\nisn\u2019t even any tea; green, bubble or oth-erwise.\nThere are however several vaguely\neastern dishes packed with flavour.\nThere are the soft potato-and-skin\nslices in the creamy vegetable curry, or\nthe bright bell papers in the Malaysian.\nThere\u2019s succulent nuggets of meat if\nyou get salt-and-pepper chicken or the\nbright orange gloopiness of its sweet\nand spicy sister. I especially appreciate the goblets filled to the brim with\nred-hot Lya-Jyao sauce, to sate those\nof us who treat a spice as a nutritional\npriority over protein and carbs and to\nsweeten the deal they have those awesome cardboard cartons to eat from,\nafter they\u2019ve been stuffed generously\nwith grub.\nBut best of all? It\u2019s spreading around\nLondon. Now Chopstix (and its identical siblings Wox and Noodle Box else-where) is my first point of call for a reliably tasty meal that you can order and\nstart stuffing into your mouth within a\nminute. It\u2019s not so much fast-food as\ninstant-food but no less tasty for it.\nMaybe though I\u2019m too easily pleased,\nand am sullying Felix\u2019s food pages by\nreviewing a cheap, unauthentic, over-flavoured eatery frequented by people\nlike me with a bi-polar palette-gauge of\ndelicious and sub-delicious. So I asked\nNicole Ahmed, who is instead someone\nwho describes eating Thai food as like\nwalking into a garden of scents and fra-grances.\nAnd she likes Chopstix too.\nChopstix 28 Thurloe Street London\nSW7 2LT\nTry Chopstix\nOmar Hafeez-Bore\ndescended on MADD demanding the\nsame service, albeit not so amusing for\nRalph. But hey, it\u2019s an idea.\nMADD bears a striking resemblance\nto the other more familiar yoghurt\nbrands like Snog, Yuforia and Frog,\ncapitalizing on clean white d\u00e9cor complete with quirky colours and a slogan\nhere and there; but its unique dedication\nto the mango is one unheard of amongst\nLondoners. When asked, \u201cWhy the\nmango?\u201d Ralph is animated in informing us that the fruit bears plenty of\nhealthy vitamins and is one of the most\neaten fruits in the whole of Asia. His\nexperiences whilst travelling there have\nprovided much of the inspiration for his\nextensive desserts menu. And the results\nare sublime.\nOur Mango Sago bowl combines\nmango with sago pearls, a starch ingredient originating from New Guinea but\nrarely presented to the Western palate,\nand is one of the best representations in\nLondon of a Mango, Sago and Pomelo\ndessert I often seek in Hong Kong. Next\ncomes the Mango MADDness, a jumbo\nplatter featuring sticky glutinous rice\nwith mango, a mango pudding and a\nPanna Cotta that was created especially\nfor MADD with a chef from Le Cordon\nBleu. You\u2019d be challenged to finish that\nall on your own, which is why MADD\nis a place to visit with friends. Jenga\ntowers, Connect 4 and UNO cards complete the experience where you can just\nbe a bit... MADD.\nRupert Street is also home to the\nheavily publicized Bubbleology, which\nserves Taiwanese bubble tea, a beverage containing tiny tapioca pearls which\nslide up into your mouth as you sip. In\nmy opinion, it\u2019s overrated, definitely\nnot original (although its PR says other-wise) and I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re opening a pop-up store in Harvey Nichols\nnext month. Try it if you\u2019re not used to\nhaving balls in your mouth.\nFinally, you can also find the food\nblogger\u2019s favourite, Spuntino, serving\ncomfort food with an Italian-American\ntwist, on this street.

Did you put the bait away\nsomewhere, duck?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the biscuit tin on the shelf\nby the window. Next to the spice\nrack. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\u201cWell what in God\u2019s name did you\nput it there for?\u201d\n\u201cIf you will leave it lying around on\nthe table, I\u2019ll put it away wherever I\nsee fit. If you want to know where it\nis, then next time you make sure you\ntidy it away.\u201d\nThey argued in the friendly\nbantering tones of a couple who\u2019ve\nT\nhe old man walked into the\nkitchen, carefully holding his\nfishing rod in front of him. He\nwas manoeuvring it gingerly to\navoid knocking anything off the\ncluttered kitchen shelves with the\nswaying tip, before finally propping\nit against the jamb of the front door.\nWhen she saw him come in, his wife\npaused from wiping a damp rag over\nthe table, and stood back to observe\nhim, fixing up a few strands of long\nhair back into the tight bun they had\nescaped from. Like the table, she\nwas plain and roughly cut, heavy and\nsturdy. Her hair was sparse and grey as\niron, contrasting with her husband\u2019s\nthatch of downy white hair as her soft\nfeatures did with his angular ones.\n\u201cBeautiful day, today,\u201d said the old\nman in his broad Yorkshire brogue.\n\u201cThought I\u2019d go out and see if I\ncould catch something.\u201d\n\u201cAgain? Seems like I saw you going\nout with that fishing rod only a few\ndays ago. There\u2019s still quite a bit of\nthe last catch left.\u201d\n\u201cThat were two weeks ago, duck.\nBesides, we mayn\u2019t get a day like this\nagain till next year. Got to make the\nmost of it while we can.\u201d He turned\nand looked out of a window, blinking\nat the brightness of the day. If he\nexpected to see any sign of impending\nstorms, he was to be disappointed.\nIt truly was one of those days that\ncome around only a handful of times\nevery summer in Yorkshire. A day\nwith hot sun, dry air, and a slight\ncooling breeze. The dales rolled away\ninto the distance from the cottage,\nwith the only sounds being the slight\nrustling of the grass, and a faint buzz\nfrom cables strung between a line of\npylons that crossed an adjacent field,\nvanishing into the distance in opposite\ndirections. There were a group of\ncows on the far side of the field, who\nhad decided to shelter from the heat\nof the day in the shadow of an oak,\nchewing cud and lapping water from\na stream. The cows were beef cattle;\nwhite-faced Black Herefords; so the\nfarmer who owned the fields there\nabout came only rarely to lead one off\nfor slaughter.\nThe cottage had once belonged to\na gamekeeper when the fields were\npart of an estate, but the estate\u2019s\ngrounds had been parcelled off\nfor farmland fifty years ago to pay\nvarious debts, and as the current\nfarmer\u2019s father had had no use for\nthe cottage, it had been sold. First\nto a family who were enchanted\nby the beauty of the countryside,\nbut when the enchantment of the\ncountryside paled in comparison to\nthe convenience of the city, it had\npassed into the hands of the old\nman and his wife, for whom the\nconveniences of the city had long\nsince been recognised as unnecessary\nnuisances. It would have been lonely\nfor most, but the old couple had\neach other, and they saw no need\nfor any other regular company. The\ncottage itself was a typical affair for\nYorkshire, built of the dun-coloured\nchunks of stone that characterise the\nhousing of that district, two stories\nhigh and roughly cubic in shape,\nwith a shallowly-sloped slate roof. At\nthe front of the cottage, a macadam\ntrack led between two fields until it\nexited onto an A-road where cars\nzipped back and forth, too far away\nfor any engine noise to disturb the\ncottage occupants, and at the back\nthere was a cobbled yard surrounded\nTHE\nFISHING\nTRIP\nBY\nCHRIS\nREYNOLDS\n\n"

There have been various attempts over the years demanding that\nthe church tries to put right the hideous\ncrimes performed by its members, including a high profile effort to have\nthe Pope arrested on his trip to Britain\nlast year, headed by prominent atheists Christopher Hitchens and Richard\nDawkins. Their lack of success comes\nas no shock to me; the Catholic Church\nhas, after all, built its defenses tall and\nstrong, impenetrable to the opposition\nit faces.\nWhat I do find shocking, and detest-able, is the absence of support by those\nin power for the people who have been\nbrave enough to stand up to the church.\nIf you care to examine our own govern-ment, for example, you will notice that\nnot only have they failed to provide\nanything resembling encouragement\nfor those seeking justice, last year they\nactually rolled out the red carpet to the\nman at the centre of the scandal. All at\nthe expense of the tax payer, of course.\nHow can we as a nation feel comfortable with this? How can we, on the one\nhand, send our troops to far off countries to emancipate those worse off than\nus from terrible tyranny, and on the\nother, show an unflinching solidarity\nwith an organisation that fails to move\naway from its arcane beliefs in subjuga-tion? The covering up of child rape and\nmolestation is a heinous crime, which\nshould be met with appropriate disgust\nand animosity. In this particular case,\nit does not seem to have elicited this\nresponse from those who could really\nmake a difference.\nWhat makes matters worse is that the\nrot in the Catholic Church that allows\nthese crimes to continue has spread all\nthe way to the top. It was, after all, the\nfuture Pope Benedict XVI who in 1985,\nwhilst still a bishop, refused to defrock a\nCalifornian priest with a known history\nof sexually molesting children, citing\n\u201cthe good of the universal church\u201d as his\nexplanation. It was Pope Benedict XVI,\nthis time in his current position, who offered immunity and safety in the Vatican to Cardinal Law, former head of the\nArchdiocese of Boston. Law resigned\nafter it was revealed that he approved\nthe transfer of Rev. John Geoghan to\nanother parish under the knowledge that\nhe had raped at least 7 boys. These are\njust two examples of the conniving that\ngoes on amongst those who hold lofty\npositions in the Vatican.\nEven if child molestation was the only\nissue towards which the church has displayed a loathsome attitude, the mutual\nfriendship it has with governments of\nthe world would surely cause us all to\nraise an eyebrow at the very least. The\nfact that these attitudes stretch across\na manifold of issues make the respect\nit enjoys nothing short of nauseating.\nFor example, the church preaches that\npeople such as these disgusting paedo-philes can, merely through the act of\nasking for forgiveness, experience an\neternity of bliss in heaven after they die.\nThe same generosity is not offered to\nthose who experience love with someone of the same sex. This is viewed\nas, to quote from the famous Leviticus\nverse, an \u201cabomination.\u201d To see this as\nanything other than hateful babble is to\nsurrender your own integrity as a moral\nhuman being.\nThe Pope, as an individual, deserves\nno more respect than the organisation\nhe governs. I would ask you all to es-Mass deception\ntimate how many lives you think have\nbeen ruined directly by the Pope\u2019s stand\non HIV, which as he has preached in the\npast \u201ccannot be overcome through the\ndistribution of condoms, which even\naggravates the problems.\u201d I would challenge anyone to come up with a more\ndestructive, divisive statement. It has\nundoubtedly led to the deaths of thousands of people at the hands of this terrible illness. For a man who is meant to\nbe a beacon of morality to those in need,\nthe Pope certainly has a lot of questions\nto answer.\nThe church\u2019s reluctance to budge\nfrom a set of archaic beliefs derived\nfrom a book written by second hand\nauthors nearly 2000 years ago should\ngive us pause for reflection. It has, in\nmy opinion, become impossible for any\nself-respecting government to associate\nitself with this administration without\nexperiencing palpable cognitive disso-nance. It is not until we start to question\nthe actions of religious leaders ruling as\ndemagogues that we can truly start to\nclaim we are moving in the right direc-tion, and fighting for freedom the world\nover.\nThe Catholic Church is not a force for good in this world\nSam Horti\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\u201c\ne\n\u201d\nThe Pope, as an individual,\ndeserves no more respect than\nthe organisation he governs\nA great number of controversial decisions\nhave been taken at Imperial this year. Some\nhave been taken by departments, some have\nbeen taken by central College management,\nothers have been taken by the Union. The one\nthing that unites them, something that Felix\nhas always been pleasantly surprised by, is\nthe willingness of the decision-makers to put\nforward their argument; to answer questions\nabout their motivations; and to make themselves accountable. Of course this has occurred to varying degrees, and we have not\nalways agreed with their arguments or moti-vations, but the story of the past academic\nyear is of people accepting the accountability\nthat must come with authority. Which is why\nwe are disappointed that this accountability\nhas not accompanied Imperial\u2019s decision to\ncut its \u00a33,000 subscription to the Campaign\nfor Science and Engineering (CaSE).\nThere has been no explanation given for\nthe decision. Well, no proper explanation. To\nsay that it was felt the \u00a33,000 would be better directed towards \u201ccore activities\u201d doesn\u2019t\nexplain why somebody thought CaSE\u2019s lobbying efforts weren\u2019t already benefiting Imperial\u2019s core activities. (We would truly love\nto hear the reasoning behind this, it is self-evident that helping to protect our research\nbudget from more stringent cuts and lobbying successfully to improve the lot of our\noverseas researchers in the visa system\nbenefits Imperial\u2019s core activities.)\nBut even if the argument was made, who\nwould make it? The person normally responsible for Imperial\u2019s relationship with CaSE\nwould be the Pro-Rector for Research. But\nthis role is currently unfilled; Professor David\nBegg of the Business School is standing in\ntemporarily. Did he make this decision? Is\nthe decision linked to the departure of the\nprevious Pro-Rector for Reseach, Professor\nSir Peter Knight? The College have refused\nto shed further light, saying only that the\ndecision was made \u201ccollectively\u201d, which essentially means that no-one is going to take\nresponsibility for the decision.\nWhy is it important that somebody be held\nresponsible? The answer is not complicated:\nthis decision affects a large number of people\nat Imperial. Researchers at Imperial are now\nleft without a formal voice in the UK\u2019s most\nprominent science and engineering lobby\ngroup. At a time when the science and engineering sector faces great challenges, this is\nvery alarming.\nPeople across Imperial have been willing\nto stand by their decisions, make their ar-guments, and be held accountable for the\nchoices that they have made in the past year.\nFelix too has done so, and has apologised\nwhen it has made mistakes. We believe the\ndecision to leave CaSE is stupid and a step\nin the wrong direction, but if there\u2019s a good\nargument for doing so, whoever made the\ndecision should have the decency to stand\nup and make that argument.\nFELIX\nAccountability is needed\n\u201cWhy are they booing? What do you mean \u2018they were expecting Colin Firth?\u2019\u201d\n\n"

It might be a\nstretch, but ideas like this may soon be a reality\nthanks to a technique called atomic layer deposi-tion.\nThe technique involves coating woven cotton or\nplastic bags with conductive nanocoatings, such as\nthose found in solar cells or microelectronics. Atomic layer deposition is capable of coating a textile\nfabric so that each fiber has the same nanoscale-thick coating that is thousands of times thinner\nthan a human hair. The research shows that common textile materials could soon be used for complex electronic devices.\n\u201cResearch like this has potential health applications since we could potentially create a uniform\nwith cloth sensors that could track heart rate, body\ntemperature, movement and more in real time. To\ndo this now, you would need to stick a bunch of\nwires throughout the fabric \u2013 which would make it\nbulky and uncomfortable\u201d, says Dr. Jesse Jur, lead\nauthor of the paper published in Advanced Functional Materials.\nFELIX\n8\nIn brief\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nCharlie Harvey\nThea Cunningham\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 10 june 2011\nKermit-ted to helping out\nScientists at Queen\u2019s University Belfast have discovered proteins in frog skins that could be used\nto treat cancer, diabetes, stroke and transplant patients by regulating the growth of blood vessels.\nThe research identified two proteins that can be\nused in a controlled and targeted way to regulate\nangiogenesis \u2013 the process by which blood vessels\ngrow in the body. The proteins, found in secretions\non the skins of the Waxy Monkey Frog and the Giant\nFirebellied Toad, have the ability to either stimulate\nor inhibit the growth of blood vessels.\nMost cancer tumours can only grow to a certain\nsize before they need blood vessels to grow into the\ntumour to supply it with vital oxygen and nutrients.\nBy \u2018switching off\u2019 angiogenesis and inhibiting blood\nvessel growth, the Waxy Monkey Frog protein has\nthe potential to kill cancer tumours.\nMeanwhile, a protein from the Giant Firebellied\nToad is able to stimulate blood vessel growth.\nThis has the potential to treat an array of diseases\nand conditions that require blood vessels to repair\nquickly, such as wound healing, organ transplants\nand strokes.\nIt\u2019s a strange feeling when you first step into\nan Alzheimer\u2019s care home. What hits you\nimmediately is the smell of urine and cheap\nschool dinners, but the far more unnerving aspect is the sea of blank faces that greets you.\nI\u2019m here to see my grandma, who has been\nsuffering from Alzheimer\u2019s for a number of\nyears.\nAs I progress down the thick-carpeted hallways towards her room, my gaze catches a\ngroup of people sitting in easy-chairs in a loose\ncircle, facing each other as if to facilitate con-versation. But they\u2019re not here to talk; instead,\nthey mumble away to themselves, uncertain of\nwhere they are, forced out of their own homes\ninto one that\u2019s been chosen by their children\nfor convenience.\nWhen I finally get to my grandmother\u2019s\nroom, I gingerly loiter at the door: she\u2019s tucked\nup in bed, being carefully fed by a nurse. I feel\nlike a voyeur, like I\u2019m watching something I\nshouldn\u2019t, witnessing the cyclical nature of\nlife, and death, as my grandma is fed like a\nbaby. At first I\u2019m not sure if this is the right\nroom, as her complexion shocks me. This is\nnot the person I knew before, who helped me\nbuild sandcastles, and fish in rock pools on\ncarefree school summer holidays spent in Dorset. Instead, her weathered skin loosely wraps\nher toothless skull, her thick-rimmed glasses\nmagnifying tired, confused eyes.\nAt first I just stand there, rudely staring, but\nthe nurse catches my eye and smiles, gently\nmoving closer to grandma, \u201cThere\u2019s someone to see you Betty.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to see\nanybody,\u2019\u2019 comes the curt response, but I enter anyway and sit on a chair in the corner of\nthe room, as the nurse helps her out of bed and\ninto a chair. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t want to see\nme, I tell myself, it\u2019s just that she\u2019s probably\nscared, and doesn\u2019t know who I am.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1906 that a German doctor called Alois Alzheimer first identified the\ndisease that came to be named after him. Despite this, it was only much later that it was\ncharacterised as a neuro-degenerative disease,\ncaused by the misfolding of certain proteins in\nthe body.\nIt is the misfolding of two proteins \u2013 amy-loid and tau \u2013 which causes them to clump and\ntangle inside brain cells. The continual buildup of plaques and tangles eventually causes the\ncells to die, explaining the progressive loss of\nbrain function that characterises Alzheimer\u2019s.\nDespite the fact that Alzheimer\u2019s has been\nknown about for over a century, treatment is\nstill relatively primitive. But researchers at the\nUniversity of Cardiff have uncovered a new\nmolecular interaction that may help us understand what causes Alzheimer\u2019s in the first\nplace, and design better treatments.\nInstead of looking at traditional targets of\ntau and amyloid in isolation, the team led by\nProfessor Trevor Dale, looked at the interactions between amyloid and nucleic acids \u2013 the\nbuilding blocks of DNA. Together the two\ncan combine to form Amyloid-Nucleic Acid\n(ANA) fibres, which can also cause deadly\nplaques in the brain.\nAccording to Professor Dale, the findings\ncould have \u201cimportance for Alzheimer\u2019s disease because it may be that we can find a way\nto stop the ANA fibres forming and protect the\nbrain from harm.\u201d\nWhile long-term drug development prospects for Alzheimer\u2019s are poor, Professor Dale\nsaid that \u201ccontinued funding and basic research\nwill be essential\u201d, especially as the number of\nsufferers in the UK will continue to rise to an\nestimated 1.7 million by 2050.\nThis is something Dr Simon Ridley, Head of\nResearch for Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, ech-oed, as \u201cresearch is the only answer to heading\nthis off, giving us hope of new treatments and\nbetter evidence for prevention. We must invest\nin research at all levels now to avert a dementia\ncrisis in the next generation.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a sobering sight to see my grandmother,\nonce close to six feet tall, now huddled, diminished and shrunken in a chair. But when her\nweathered face breaks into a toothless smile as\nshe recognises me for a few brief moments, I\nrealise how important it is for more money to\nbe pumped into research, in the hope that a potentially breakthrough treatment can be made\navailable to help ease the suffering of patients\nsuch as grandma.\nGeorge Wigmore\nGrandma, Alzheimer\u2019s and me\nAlzheimer\u2019s causes neurons like these to become tangled by proteins, killing them\nAlzheimer\u2019s could affect 1.7 million people in the UK by 2050\n\n"

In the past three\nyears there has been a doubling in the\nnumber of hives registered \u2013 from 40,000\nin 2007 to 80,000 in 2010 \u2013 and with it,\na doubling of UK bee numbers.

The garden isn\u2019t very well\nknown (hence the \u2018secret\u2019bit) but is open\nto all Imperial students and staff. An\ninitial bee stock has just been put into the\nhive, with the hope that the population\nwill multiply, perhaps filling a second\nhive.\nStudents from the Environmental\nSociety, who will be going on a\nbeekeeping course to learn how to keep\nthe bees happy and healthy, will manage\nthe colony and will train future members\nto do the job, adding the position of\nApiarist to their committee.

Environmental\nOfficers Stef Piatek and Reuben Gibbons\nAcolony of bees is made up\nof a single queen, several\nhundred male bees or drones,\nand up to 50,000 female worker\nbees. The queen bee can live for\nup to three years and in that time\ncan lay more than 500,000 eggs.\nBeekeepers can start out with a\nnatural colony, an artificial one\n(packed in a box) or a nucleus,\nwhich is a core colony with fewer\ndrones and workers. Colonies\nalso vary in temperament, so\nwe as beginners obtained docile\nones unlikely to swarm. We also\nhave the traditional suits and a\nsmoker, a device used to surround the hive with smoke, making the bees think that there\u2019s a\nforest fire and focus on eating\ntheir honey rather than swarm-ing, allowing us to work in the\nhive without mass attack. Next\nspring we\u2019ll be checking that the\nqueen is laying eggs, and clearing\naway debris from the winter like\ndead bees and cobwebs. Over\nthe summer the colony will be\ngrowing quickly and could reach\nup to 50,000 bees. If space for\negg laying and honey storing runs\nout, the queen leaves the hive\nwith some workers to start a new\ncolony and the bees feed a larva\nwith Royal Jelly to make a new\nqueen. In August, we\u2019ll be collecting the honey \u2013 a good summer\ncan produce around 40lbs. In Autumn, this honey will be replaced\nby feeding the bees with a sugar\nsolution, and then the whole cycle can repeat for another year.\nBee-keeping explained\nBees introduced to Imperial\u2019s\n\u2018Secret Garden\u2019\nwere excited about the opportunity: \u201cTo\nget the chance to take part in beekeeping\nis not something many students,\nespecially those living in central London\nget to do \u2013 it\u2019s almost unimaginable. It\u2019s\nreally exciting that we start off with one\nhive out of about a quarter of a million\nthat are in the UK, and with years\nwe aim to expand our apiary to two.\nSomehow the name \u201cImperial Apiary\u201d\nsounds like we should have little flying\nstormtroopers, and we like both of those\nideas a lot. Ideally we\u2019d make things like\nDrambuie or Mead along side one of the\nfood societies with any excess honey.\nThe hives are part of Imperial\u2019s long\nterm sustainability strategy, known\nas StepChange. Recent achievements\nhave included the Student Switch Off\ncampaign, which saw a 3% reduction in\nHalls\u2019electricity usage, and the ComPod,\nan on-site composter that turns Imperial\u2019s\nfood waste into compost rather than\nsending it to landfill.\nFor the latest updates on the bees\u2019\nprogress, visit ESoc\u2019s blog at http://\nunion.ic.ac.uk/scc/esoc\nVisit ESoc\u2019s\nblog at\nunion.ic.ac.\nuk/scc/esoc\nImperial College London\nImperial College London\n\n"
