In southern Sweden some time ago I visited the only rubber cow shed in the world.\nHere 150 cows lived in a building where the\nfloors and walls were lined with rubber,\ncarefully designed to keep the animals comfortable without the use of straw, and allow\neasy and thorough cleansing. The cows were\nnot allowed to graze in the fields as that\nwould have trampled down too much fodder,\nbut the grass was cut and brought to the\ncow shed by lorry, and a small electric overhead railway carried round the shed, appropriate quantities being dropped in front of the\nanimals. Behind the stalls ran a continuous\nrubber-lined trough which received the byproducts of bovine metabolism, to be collected\nand stored in a vast underground tank beneath\nthe shed and in due course pumped back on to\nthe fields. To prevent contamination from this trough\neach eow te tail ws s attached by means of a spring-loaded wire to an overhead hook so\nthat when the animal lay down on its rubber\nbed, its tail was hoisted clear of the ground.\nTo make certain that the products of bovine\nmetabolism reached the trough, a metal rod\nwas suspended horizontally in each st sll and\nadjusted to the height of its occupant. If the\ncow's shoulders were too far forward when\nabout to defecate, the rod was touched, the\nanimal received an electric shock and moved\nbackwards to the correct'dropping point'.\nIn this way, and with a very small labour\nforce, the dairy farmer, an enterprising\nSwedish industrialist, had succeeded in producing milk that was almost germ free, although\nI believe it was then sent from the farm to\nthe local co-operative dairy where It was mixed\nwith infected milk from 'normal' farms and\npasteurised.\nYours etc.,\nFrederick E.

Injuries? A few bruises,\na damaged finger nail and a broken hockey stick.\nThis follow esa hockey record of 2 won, 2 lost.\nIn squash we have won only one match this\nterm due to lack of experienced players. The\nNetball team has lost only one league match,\nand beat the men of the Zoology Dept. by 14-5.\nTable Tennis has just lost two matches and had\nde old ed wins in its other two matches.

Potentially the l st. team is the\nstrongest since the days of Kenyon and his men.\nHowever through one reason and another this\nstrength has not been born out in practice.\nWe have lost twice to our greatest non Hospital\nrivals, Kings College. The second of these\ndefeats took place on Dec 9th.w he m we lost by\n2 ties to 1 in the l st. round of the University.\n3 a side Cup.

ROWING\nDuring the last two weeks the club has been\nin active competition. On Dec. 1st. the 4th. and 5th. eights went to Chiswlck to compete in\nthe University of London Winter Eights Regata.\nThe results of the days rowing ware that the\n5th. VIII won the Junior Division but the 4th. VIII were unfortunately disqualified In their\nsecond heat. The cox had certainly moved too\nfar over into the Guys Hospital crew's water\nbut a disqualification seems to be a harsh\ndecision in a race between two real at iv ly inexperienced crews. Congratulations must be\nextended to the 5th. VIII who won their final in a faster time than the final of the Senior\nDivision.\nOn Sat. 8th. Dec. the club were hosts to\nLincoln College, Oxford l st. crew. The IC\nl st. VIII raced over a Murphy course and\nfinished victors by 10 sees.

Twentyfive mem bei joined in with ULMC who sent two coaches to the\nOgwen Valley.\nDue to the weather any climbing of a really\nhigh standard was out of the question but many\npleasant rock climbs were completed. 4 o 'clock\nSaturday afternoon saw most of the IC party\nmaking their way towards the tents or the hut.\nOthers, however were less fortunate, having\nrun out of daylight whilst still climbing on\nthe East face of Tryfan. Rescue parties were\norganised to help,the unfortunate ones and the\nVery Lights signalling from one party to another\nreminded one of Nov. 5th. Sunday morning waa gloomy with that persist ant drizzle that is so common in Wales. Most people\nhowever did some climbing and the three ICWArlan\n\u2022embers of the club apparently enjoyed their\nclimbing on the Idwal Slabs in spite of the\nlarge excess of water on the rocks.\nSunday night provided much the same story\nas Saturday night. Quite a few people found\nthemselves half way up a climb when the a un(?) disappeared.

Good luck to him 1\nOver the past few weeks there have been\napparent in student uttering s more manifestations of acrimony than usual. Some clarification of the present situation should be\nattempted.\nBasically there are four factions making\nup this college. Firstly there is the academic staff. Their function is primarily to\ncontribute to the advancement of present day\nknowledge of science and technology, and\nsecondarily to teach students so that those\nalso may eventually contribute. Secondly,\nthere is the student body, whose function it is primarily to study - social and athletic\nactivity being only a necessary subordinate.\nThirdly there is the non-academic staff,\nunderpaid yet most necessary..Lastly, there\nis ths Administration. Their function is to\nsee that the first three factions work together smoothly. They are not paid to interfere\nwith the affairs of the other three sections\nin cases when this is not necessary for admin-is t rating purposes.\nThe Union holds no brief for the staff,\nacademic or otherwise. It holds no brief\nagainst them either. But in shouting for\n'student rights\" one has to be careful. Be\nwho pays the piper calls the tune - and,\nfurthermore, although a bitter pill to s wall ow, a university exists for its \u2022sabers the graduates and staff. Undergraduates are\na ee an s to an end which has to be tolerated.\nYou have the whole Christmas vacation to\nthink this over - please do not flood us\nwith hastily written hot-ten per ed letters,\nthat section of the college is being most\nexpended in the present scheme ?\nOn the other hand, the undergraduate is en investor* He Invests three years of his\nlife In en education his country wants\n85,000 to have in the next ten years.

Arising out of the minutes\nof the last meeting the President reported that the\nRector had disbanded the Commemoration Day Committee\nan the grounds that the main lines of the ceremony\nwere now well established and that he saw no reason\nfor prolonging the life of a oom mitte e that had\nfinished its work. At the previous Counoil Meeting\nwe were informed that the Rector had also altered\nthe Hall Dinner Committee and had red u oed the student\nrepresentation from 5 to 2. However, he has since\nagreed to re-include the 3 Vice-Presidents on the\nCommittee and it ia hoped that they will take the\nopportunity to get Hall Dinner well and truly sorted\nout.\nIt had been pointed out that the U.L. U. were\nable to produce meals similar to those at I.C. for\n3d. or 4d.a course cheaper because the salaries of\nthe permanent staff there were not charged against\nthe Refectory but were in fact treated as a charge\nagainst the Administration.\nThe following so he dule for Christmas o losing was agreed: (a) Ayrton Hall and Bar: Closed after\nlu noh on 21st Deo. until lunch on Jan. 2nd.( b) Union: Closed after lunch on 21 at Dso. until\nlu noh on Jan. 34th.(o) Snack Bar: Closed.after\nlu noh on 21st Deo. and open for breakfast only from\n2nd to 14th Jan. and thereafter as before*\ndeserves some respect even if he does not\ndeserve all the hostel ac como dati on etc.\nthat he claims.

It makes me, the first Editor,\nfeel even more ancient than the stresses and strains\nof nine years at the College have made me look; ancient,\nbut rather smug that the paper we started in 1949 has\nbecome a regular feature of College life. It also\nprovides n ve with the novel experience of being dunned\nby the Editor for an art iole the biter bit.\nOf what o an one write on such an occasion? Of\nthe perfidy of Governments (various, according to\ntaste), the iniquitous oost of practically everything desirable,the dil a tori ness of union contractors,\nthe deplorable absence of present day Links in the\nbar on Thursdays, the antics of the most explosive\nPresident since Dai Nicholas left to get Big\nBusiness 30r ted out - these and many more such\nsub j eot s would seem to be more properly the province of the present staff of Felix. I think the\nbest thing to do is to recall the early days of\nFelix.\nIt is axiomatic that the Golden Age of any\nactivity is that age in which one took part per-son ally; the Age of Giants is that immediately\npreceding it. Thus, the Age of Giants in the Onion\nwas the period immediately after the state of armed\no on fli ot we knew as The War. The Golden Age was the\nlate IfO's and early 50's. In both these Ages a vast reorganisation of\nUnion affairs took place, from which has emerged\nthe Union we know today. Moat of the students at\nthat time were ex-servicemen, mostly off io ers, wise beyond their years in the ways of this\nwicked world. It was particularly fortunate that\nthis influx of administrative experience should\noo in oi de with Dr. Hoyle becoming Treasurer; I suspect that few people now at College realise\njust how mu oh we owe him .(not literally - read on)\nfor his tremendous efforts in putting the Union\nfina noes on their present sound footing.\nIt was during a discussion in the bar (the\nright pla oe for discussion, and not just bawdy\nsc rig) under the general heading \"what o an bo done\nto make the Union mare oo he sive?\", Derek Howe suggested a College newspaper. This seemed a Good\nIdea, and still did next day.\nAt that time Derek was Resident of- the Guilds\nand a tower of strength in the Hookey Club, the\nDramatic Society and I. C.W. A. He is now a monk of\ngreat renown, having wearied of the sordid life we\nlead and joined a Roman Catholic teaching Order.\nWhen I last heard from him he was about to take\nhis final vows.\nWe got promises of support from what we\nregarded as the key points in the Union, the\nAthletic Clubs and the Mines (the Guilds we knew\nwould support Derek, who was a very popular\nPresident. The R.C.S. would follow tamely enough,\nbut the Mines oo ul d have wrecked it). Jimmy\nBooth and John Taylor of the Mines joined us,\nand Council voted a loan of, I think, \u00a320 to\ncover the fir3 t issue on the understanding that\nit would then be self-supporting.\nLooking back on those early issues leaves\n.'\u2022<\u2022\u2022' ' \u2022\nliterary standard of many of our contributors,\nand the often naive but essentially undergraduate flavour of the articles.

    "content": "Newspapers often remind UK of the strain\nimposed by rush-hour travel on London Transport\nbut personally I find tube journeys stimulating\nto the mind. Coming to S. Ken. from Putney the\nother day, my train, bound for Mansion House,\nPulled in at Earl's Court Station. Here I was\nquick to observe an Upminster train on the\nopposite side of the platform. Now, being a clever sort of a blok e,I waited in my Mansion\nHouse train until I saw the signal light for\nthe other train turn to green. I then dashed\nacross the platform, having deduced from observations on previous occasions that the Upminster train would then go off first. However, even the sharpest of us - and as\nI say, I'm quite a clever chap myself, are\nliable to slip up and on this occasion some\ncontrary little man at the back of the train\nshut the doors sharp ish like, so that, as I was proceeding with considerable forward mom-ent um,I was obliged to leave my teeth marks on the door paintwork. Keeling my loose incisors I turned round ruefully and was suddenly\nconscious of a second green light ln!\nthe corner of my eye and the doors of the Mansion\nHouse train were sliding to.\nUomentarily frustrated, I swore. I decided\nto cut my losses and take the Piccadilly Line,\nto S.iCe n. Now, escalators are dashed delightful diverse devices f for not only do they save\npoor old ladies from walking upstairs but by\nvirtue of their adverts, they provide amusement (and a certain amount of stimulation) for\nyoung chaps like me. (Incidentally it is gratifying to note that dog owners are required\nto carry their pets so that they can look at\nthe pictures and so learn about the facts of\nhuman life.) The advert, by U SS BK-S. attracted my attention. These gentlemen try to give you the\nidea that their hired evening suits will somehow give you confidence if you are obliged to\ngive a speech at some formal gathering. But a clever chap like me can see through them. It\nis not really their evening dress which gives\nthe chap in the advert, confidence, he's got\nhis twin brother sitting on one side of him\nand his elder brother on the other.

The first\npart of the concert began with Puree11's 'Chaoony\nin G Minor', rendered with due solemnity by the Jaoques\nOrchestra conducted by Imogen Hoist. Then f11 owed the\nwork commissioned for last Commemoration Day, 'The\nShepheard's Wonder', by Christopher Shaw.

In Benjamin Britten's 'Antiphon' (first London\nperformance), and in the setting by Puroell of Psalm 3\nin Latin, the Choir was very ably ba oke d up by professional soloists.

    "content": "FELIX HALL DINNER - ITS PURPOSE ?\nKail Dinner was instituted a few years ago\nwith the object of providing staff and students\nwith an opportunity to meet informally at as oc if ll function. A subsidiary purpose was to\ngive people a suitable chance to entertain\nguests in their college. These aims (especially\nthe first) were considered worthy of a handsome subsidy in order to encourage people to\ns<t tend. One might expect from the rapid bookings\nfor Hall Dinners that tn ese aims are being\namply fulfilled. A more thorough in ves tigHt lon shows that this is by no means the case,\nfo me recent Hall Dinners have reduced the\nalleged objects to a farce. On December 11th. Hall dinner was arranged early so that diners\ncould go on to the play. In other words, ao he up meal for those going to the play. Anyone wanting to go to Hall Dinner in the usual\nway was swamped out. There seems to be no\njustification for sub sidi sing such a function\nas this, and even less justification anyway\nfor perverting an alleged Hall Dinner out of\nall recognition.\nEome weeks ago the Chemical Engineering\nDepartment presented some silver to the college at a Hall Dinner. This Dinner, too, was\nbooked out in record time, almost entirely by\nmembers of the Chem. Eng. Department. This\nwas,in fact, a Departmental occasion marked by\nceremonies and speeches which could have been\na pleasant addition to the Chemical Engineering\nSociety's dinner a few weeks later but were\nwholly out of place at Hall Dinner, which was\nnot really a Hall Dinner at all. Block bookings by large groups within the\ncollege were BAMIXD at the last Union meeting\nby an overwhelming majority. Block bookings,\nof, for instance, a group old boys from a certain school means simply that the college\nis sub sidi sing an Old Boys' reunion, and an\nend to these block bookings should certainly\ngive more people a chance and lend more significance to the true purpose of the function.\nUnfortunately block bookings in considerable numbers seem to be the order of the day\namong the staff. Gone ore the days when prof6. took it in turns to take the chair. In fact\nthe character of Hall Dinner has become that\nof an official college dinner at which student ts provide s pleasant chattering background to\nthe entertainment of official college guests.\nSome members of staff valiantly entertain their\ntutorial groups or other students and sometimes\nmembers of staff are invited by students. THAT\nis the true spirit of Hall Dinner, but this\nwill never be completely recaptured until\nthe Dinner is held for its own sake and not\nperverted into an\"official college dinner\",\nor into special occasions interesting only\na fraction of the community. - Food for\nthought for the Hall Dinner committee.\nHubert K.

KNOW YOUR KENSINGTON \"Proceeding down Exhibition Road, we come to\nthe Charming group of Lowther Gardens, two red\nbrick buildings by Mr. J.J. Stevenson. Next is the 'City and Guilds of London Institute'. What are the guilds of London ? The Institute, apart from its situation, for it ought to be\nin the City, and its absurd name, will prove\na great boon to the working man when its advantages and objects are known; but it is too\nmany miles from the dwellings of those for\nwhom it is intended. The building is dark red\nbrick with carvings in lighter brick, and has\nno merits that can be mentioned, unless perhaps that it is convenient for its purpose.\nThe India Museum and other collections fill the galleries adjoining the old Royal Horticu lt ural Society's gardens. They present no\nfeature of architectural or historic interest\nas buildings. A new road and new buildings\nare to be made across part of the site for\nthe Imperial Institute. So far as plans have\nbeen made public they seem to rival even the\ncity institute in its ugliness, and to form a mean between that and Mr. Waterhouse's still more unfortunate Natural History Museum with\nwhich, to borrow a heraldic term, the building will be 'add or sed'.\" an extract from a book by W.

It commemorates, the departure from I.C. of Douglas M. Gilbey\nafter a period as aP.G., during wh i oh, lik,e most P.

May his talents flourish under\nGovernment Service. His like are to be found in all research laboratories, and of them, as of him, this poem\nis an appreciation and a memorial.\nElegy Written in a Chemistry Laboratory\nThere's the bench where Gilbey, many years ago\nWatched the moonbeams creeping o 'er the C.R.0. Watohed the dawn's faint whisper fade to evening's blur,\nWatched the moon slide up the sky, and still he did not\nstir.\nThere's the bench where Gilbey (lads, it makes me weep)\nPassed the days in slumber and the nights in sleep,\nThere's the chair he sat an when his work was de ne. Where's the apparatus? Lad, there wasn't one.\nThere's the Roy. Soo. Paper: it's unfinished yet.\nThere's the heap of crosswords that helped him to forget;\nThere's his coffee beaker, damp and thick with slime,\nStill unwashed as ever (never had the time).\nWhen the work is done, Tads, when the lamps are low,\nWhen the dawn's faint promise fades to evening's glow,\nWhen the apparatus is in a steady state,\nThat's when Gilbey's ghost comes, twenty minutes late.\nThen the ghost of Gilbey rustles through the room,\nLights along the benches, whispers in the gloom\nPonderous dilemmas, deepest ever set:\nThere's no doubt about it, Gilbey's with us yet.\nA.R.

A presentation to Miss\nHarrison solved the mystery of the BLUP, when\nshe was given a water-filled balloon with\ninstructions to drop it out of the window. This\nshe did- missing Kitch by inches and sending\nour resident photographer crazy because he hadn't his carne ra ready.\nJust before the film show, the Editor and\nVitch retired'(to the bar, of course) to judge\nthe limerick competition; two of the winning\nentries Eire printed below. As usual with FELIX\nfilm shows, the comments of the eu dien ce were as\nfunny as the films. We seemed to have an entire\nGoon Show at the back. (Shut up, ScclesJ)\nAlthough the evening wore an, the dancers did not seem to wear out, and a session of Rock 'n' Roll was held to satisfy the more energetic. Just\nbefore 11.0pm. the band played the last waltz,\nfollowed by half of \"God Save the >iu een\". Fortunately, the evening was remarkably free\nfrom incidents. Only one gentleman(?) tried to\npersuade us he was drunk- we didn't believe him.\nMost people seemed to have enjoyed themselves -we certainly did.\nLimerick Competition:\nWinning entry in the 'printable' section:\nThere was a young student of Rheims\nWhose attempts at love-making, it seems,\nWere accompanied by moans v Hot breaths and loud groans\nAnd maidens' hysterical screams.\nRunner-up:\nThere was a young student of Rheims\nWho had the most Freudian dreams\nHe became quite frustrated\n' Til his Bgo was mated\n- And now he's found out what\n\"Id\" means.\nThe winning entry was, submitted by Mr. Hen\nNotman (Room 97, New Hostel), and the runner\n-up by (Miss?) M.A. Stripp of Canterbury Hall. The winner in the 'unprintable' section was\nKeith Duckworth (C&G). Gflfje Jftrsft Vacation\nIn a few days' time many of this year's fresher s, now a little staler, will be returning home after their first prolonged break\nfrom home life. Their first days at college\nwere doubtless marked on the one hand by the\nusual sermons on the need to give one's utmost\nin one's academic studies, and on the other\nhand by the frantic attempts by the club officials to shepherd them into their own particular fold. After'this onslaught they will be left in no doubt that a full college life demands\nthat you work hard and play hard.\n\"Work hard and play hard.\" - is indeed a good slogan for a successful college life and\nlater they may consider this year, spent learning to live at this hectic pace, was not used\nto its best advantage. For students away fr on ri home there is always a tendency for the college to become the be all and end all of life; they work there, they play there and their\nfriends belong there. As time goes on they\nwill find that one way or another the college\nwill demand more and more time of them, with\ncourse work and carnivals, general studies and\nsocial studies in the bar, not forgetting hops\nand more athletic types of sport on a Saturday.\nSuch is college life. In the years to come\nwe will look back on it, and it may seem unreal\nto us - for it is unreal. We are learning how\nto make the most of our lives in an environment\noffering opportunities galore to broaden our\nminds and extend our range of activities, though\nthis is overshadowed by a sense of urgency,\ncompetition and insecurity. The people in our\neveryday lives are students and there is an\nunconscious tendency for us to regard them as\ntypical young men and women, and to regard our\ncollege life to be a natural one. This is not\nthe case and hence nobody should underestimate\nthe value of those periods when we are back at\nhome or working in industry, for it is then\nthat we are living a more normal life among\neveryday people. It is then that we realise\nthat life is not always like it is at college\nand we can take the opportunity for relaxation\nin readiness for the next term.\nBut I do not for a moment suggest that in the years to come we should content ourselves\nwith the humdrum existence which many others\nlive I do not think that many ex-students\nwould be able to. They should live a full and\nactive life, but without that hectic uncertainty which one finds at college.\nFor myself, I really enjoy college life but thank God for the vac s1 Fred Peacock\nScraps\nThou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife,\nHis ox thou shalt not slaughter;\nBut thank the lord it does not say,\nThou shalt not squeeze his daughter.\nI bet adults in adultery have far more\nfun than infants in infancy.\n\u2022 too - \u2022 IO O**mi oo \u00ab \u00ab * - .\u2022 too loo*** "

    "content": "FELIX NOT OU\nFelix the Cat has now romped through Impe rial College for seven years. He has remained essentially the earns since his birth on\nthe 9th, of .December 1949 when the first Edit or, S.U. Hughes, announced in Issue No. 1:\n\"the need has been felt for some time for a frequently published journal to comment\nupon the affairs of the College whilst they\nare stil J topical, and to bring to the attention of its:' members the activities of Clubs\nand Societies of which people at present know\ni it tl'i, and knowing little, tend to care even\nless. This IF a function which clearly cannot be performed by THE PHOENIX, particularly sir vc is that estimable bird ie now to appear\nonly twice a year, and eo FELIX has come to\nmeet the need. We do not Intend to be complementary to that journal, sven if not always\ncomplimentary. Neither are we in any way\nconnected with it, nor are we its offspring,\n(in any case, this unfortunate bird is presumably unable to produce any offspring,\nsince only one bird exists at any one time,\nrising from the ashes of its predecessor.\nPerhaps this Recounts for its doleful appear-ance). No, THE PHOENIX will remain an\nessentially literary magazine, whereas we\nshall content ourselves with providing a commentary upon events and personalities.\"\nMr. Hughes then went on to says\"The success\nor failure of this paper depends principally upon you, our readers. In the first place we\ndepend upon you to produce many of our articles and reports, since our st n ff cannot them ml nes attend and report every College <*vent. Secondl y........ lively correspondence air your\nopinions...... Thirdly buy your own copy\n\" - all of which still holds.\nThe 10th. issue appeared in the now familia\nstyle. Only four pages, the reduced size of\ntype enabled the inclusion of the same a mou m of subject matter as before. This was the C& rs\nFreshers' Issue and contained the map of South\nKensington last reproduced in No. 95 (with\nmodifications) The next issue had six pages,'\nwhich became the usual size up to Issue 94. It was notable for \" Felix Hoad Test No. 1 - The\n1926 Morris Cow]ey.\"\nAnd so we could go on; picking gems from\neach Felix. Regretably space does not allow\nthis. Beginning to flip through the fl ics in stead, one notices that No.17 was printed on\nbuff paper. Successive editions were pink, blu\nmauve, white and then buff. That experiment\nster tad and ended for no apparent reason. The\nimpression one gets from .tha earlier iesu e sie that the college was more \u2022alive' then than\nnow. The Influence of the fact that a large\nproportion of the undergraduates were mature\nex-servicemen ir reflected in the columns.\nHumour in Felix war more adult - which IF to\nbe expected. Thlr was but a phase in the pap-er's evolution - a modification to the under-lying lightheaded ness of spirit which has\nremained essentially the pane since 1949.\nThis Spirit of Felix is always evident.\nSome Editors produced \"stodgy\" issues, po me were very frivolous.
