RCS won Class 1, for cars with under 14 inch diameter wheels. The two Guilds cars, both in Class 2 for up to 20 inch\nwheels, broke down, one with a broken crankshaft, and the other with\na collapsed frame. After repair, the latter completed the course and\nfinished about 12th. Guilds were also robbed last year because of\nmechanical failure of their cars.\nLAM LEY'S AM for your\u2014\nI BOOKS\nLF ART MATERIALS\nmY PAPER SACKS\n\u2022\nSTATIONARY\ns \u2022\nOP1 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7 DEVALUATION\nESCALATION\nRACIAL SEGREGATION\nDo you need\nInformation or\nSimply Edification?\nExercise your own\ndiscrimination by\nvisiting the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\nOpen 10-7\n(10-5.30 Wednesdays)\nQUIET COUNCIL\nMEETING\nThe meeting of Council a week\nlast Monday was a quiet affair,\ncertainly by the standards of the\nprevious one. Nevertheless, due\nmainly to arguments over such\ntrivia as whether part of the\nwording of the new policy on\nUnion places in Hall should\nread \" The editor or assistant editor of FELIX \" or \"The editor\nor failing him the assistant editor\nof FELIX \" or \" The editor or if\nhe is ineligible the assistant editor\nof FELIX \" or \" The editor or in\nthe event of his not accepting a place the assistant editor of\nFELIX,\" the possibilities are\nlimitless. Everyone knew what\nthey wanted to mean, but they\nspent at least five minutes expr es sins such a simple idea.\nThe President disclosed information on the Appeals Board\nfor the Halls (see separate story),\nthat the Secretary of the College\nhad compiled a report for the\nRector on careers advice and that\nthe Registrar had written to firms\ntaking vacation trainees to try to\nimprove their wae es. New Boards\nA Union Publications Board\nwas set up, amalgamating the\npresent Felix and Phoenix Boards\nand taking in the Union Handbook. Any other Union publications which may be produced will\ncome under this Board as well.\nA constitution for the Carnival\nBoard, formal ising the present\nset-up and admitting the Chairman of Ents was accepted.\nA new policy on Union Places\nin Hall, which recommends an\nincrease of five more Union\nplaces: for the External Affairs\nand Welfare Officers and the constituent college Vice-Presidents,\nwas approved and will now be\npresented to the Halls of Residence\nCommittee for acceptance. None\nof these places will be in Student\nHouses, since it was felt that the\nreason for ha vine Union places\nwas that the people should be ac-ces sib le. JUD CO An examination of the College\nCharter by the Rector and a working paper written by the\nRector recommending the setting\nup of JUDCO\u2014the Joint Union\nand Deans Committee\u2014consisting of Council plus the Deans of\nthe three Colleges, the Rector,\nPro-Rector and Secretary of the\nCollege, were studied. A pilot\nmeeting of JUDCO is being ar-ranged.\nMr. Ruhemann, in a letter,\nbrought up the plight of overseas\nstudents who are able to register\nfor College awards and not for\nUniversity degrees, because they\nonly deal with the College when\napplying and College and University regulations are sometimes\ndifferent. The College is to be\nasked to provide information\nabout University regulations as\nwell as the College information.\nBob Fryer, the Halls of Residence rep had his jurisdiction extended to cover the residents of\nstudent houses until they can\njustify their own representative.\nExec uti ve\nPowers\nPete Ruhemann tabled a motion noting that the powers of the\nexecutive in the Union bye-laws\nare limited to domestic and urgent matters which, incredibly,\nwas defeated. Afterwards no\none seemed sure of exactly what\nthey had voted on, Keith Guy\nclaiming that the executive were\nnow not able to act on any\nmatters.\nBarbara Hedge, the External\nAffairs Officer, was instructed to\norganise IC participation in the\nTrafalgar Square rally, a motion\nthat discipline should be entrusted to the executive was voted\nfor by the executive and Rog\nChappell and defeated and the\nmeeting closed after 3| hours of\ntruly breathtaking in consequence with a suggestion that Council\nIC MEN\nBEATEN UP\nIn a so-called \" civilised \" city\nsuch as London it is surprising\nthat people are attacked and\nbeaten up for no apparent reason.\nA week last Friday Bob Mackman, RCSU President, Rob\nCollinpe, a hopeful candidate for\nCouncil, and two others slopped\non Chelsea Bridge for a hot dog\non their way back to College from\na party. After Rob Colhnge had\nbought his hot dog he vanished\nbehind the stand and when Mackman followed him a few moments\nlater. Collinge was being attacked\nb v about eight men, aged around\n30, who were trying to throw him\ninto the river. Mackman manfully strode un to this scuffle and\nbegan to explain that such dealings were not really in the rules of\ncricket. For his efforts he was\npunched five times in the face and\nrendered unconscious. Collinge\nseems to have passed out after receiving a few punches and kicks\nto the face, and would have been\nthrown in the river if the men had\nnot returned to their senses. The\nother two in the students' party\nsplit their efforts\u2014one joined the\nfight, the other, more sensibly,\nran to 'phone the police.\nThe, three warriors were taken\nto hospital where Mackman and\nCollinge were detained for two\nnights. Their recovery seems to\nhave been speeded by a lady doctor whom Mackman claims he\ntried to chat-up. The standard of\nnurses at St. Stephen's Hospital is\nnot supposed to be very high, but\nas to their nursing ability there\ncan be no doubt for Mackman\nand Collinge recovered at such a rate that they weren't discharged\nfrom hospital, but \"chucked out *\nin time for Monday lectures.\nmight meet on a Sunday after-noon, defeated because Stew\nBarnes would be seeing his girl\nfriend and ICWA were making\ndecorations for their Formal.\nThe next meeting will be 5.45\np.m. on Monday, March 18th, in\nthe reading room of the Union\nwhen once again FELIX will\nbring you exclusive coverage of\nthis mammoth spectacle.\nLRO LAUNCHES\nCAMPAIGN\n\" I'm sure my sums are right,\nI can't do mental arithmetic in\nmy head,\" said Patrick Gordon\nWalker, Minister for Education,\nin a recent Commons debate on\nthe impending cuts in education\nfinance. So claimed Graham\nSearle of King's, challenging the\ncompetence of the Government\nwhen he chaired a meeting on the\nStudent Grants Campaign at the\nInstitute of Education on Friday\n23rd. In harness with last Sunday's Trafalgar Square Rally, this\nmeeting was the launching pad of\nthe Grants Campaign in London.\n23 pc increase\nThe London Regional Organisation of NUS, of which Searle is\nChairman, called the meeting\nwhich heard representatives from\nNUS, LRO, the Association of\nTeachers in Technical Institutes\nand the Liberal Party support the\ncampaign and hammer the Education Ministry for the dictatorial\nattitude they were taking in proposing grant cuts.\nAfter reviewing the position\nthat whatever increases the independent advisory committee rec-om mends, the Government will\nslash these by half, Searle was at\npains to stress that the campaign\nwas primarily an unselfish one\nbecause the NUS were only asking for a23 per cent increase to\nrestore the 1961 purchasing power\nof the grant. The crunch will\ncome for students following us,\nas the next review is not until\n1971, when rising costs will have\ndevalued the grant even further.\nEric Robinson, of the ATTI,\nsaid his personal view was that\nthis government would go down\nin education history as conservative and backward, not realising that in a time when we were\neconomically deprived of basic\nresources we would have to depend on the skill and resources\nof our people. In this context,\nstudents become very important\npeople. He also stated that to\nwin the campaign, students would\nhave to make coherent and explicit statements of their case and\nof its consequences, not merely\nrely on rabble rousing and he was\nglad that NUS seemed to be\nadopting this line.\nNUS Position\nGeoff Martin, president of\nNUS. following Mr. Robinson,\nsaid little that hadn't been said\nbefore, but appeared to convince\nmost of those present that NUS\nwasnt the inefficient, bumbling\norganization that it had sometimes appeared to be. He mentioned we should be ingenious in\npointing out ways the government\ncan make savings within the present system, such as abolishing\nthe \u00a350 minimum grant which\nwould result in a saving of nearly\n\u00a3500,000.\nChristopher Greene, from the\nLiberals, the only party speaker\nat a meeting which advertised\nspeakers from all parties, thought\nthat it was a pity the issue had\nnow become a political one, but\nnow that it was it should be\nfought to the finish.\nSLL slam NUS\nComments from the floor came from members of the very vocal\nSocialist Labour League, who evidently believed Geoff Martin was\nleading a sell-out to the govern-ment. They were sure that the\ncampaign would fail unless the\nleft wing MPs were \" made to\nstand up and fight Wilson.\"\nWhether or not the S.L.L. forecast of the result turns out to be\ncorrect, they gained a certain\namount of qualified support from\nGerry Johnson, president of UC,\nwho thought the NUS approach\nwas laughable in its timidity.\nAnother floor speaker was\nDigby Jacks of RSA who mentioned the possibility of raising the\nmeans test starting limit from\n\u00a3700 to \u00a31100 p.a. and applying\na bigger squeeze on the richer\nparent. In answer to this Martin\nsaid that they had already put\nbefore the Minister a scheme\nwhich would do this, cost parents\nwhose income was \u00a34,500 a year\nonly an extra \u00a316 per year and\nsave the country \u00a31 million a year.\nUNIVERSITY\nOF BIRMINGHAM open day Saturday, April 27th1030a.m. \u2014 5 pj n.

Despite Martin Lack attempting to\nshut off all the fire hoses and bar\nall ways of access to the roofs\nsurrounding Beit Quad, we had\nour Shrove Tuesday feast of banal\nablution to prepare us for the\nabstinence of Lent. Unlike\nMorphy Day and the Swimming\nGala, the Pancake race did get\noff the ground and gave a few\npeople the chance to sling water\nat each other. In spite of the ab-sense of your hydrophobic pre si dent, Ray Phillips, ICWA executive and prominent members of\nICU threw their pancakes with\ngreat abandon ,and amongst cascades of pure undiluted water\nICWA won by a distance.\nCouncil\nDiscipline\nAt the Council meeting a week\nlast Monday three members of\nthe Union were suspended for\nshort periods.\nTwo gentlemen who had spent\nthe night in the 1CW A lounge and\nwere discovered early the next\nmorning by a security guard were\nsuspended for one week. The\nsecurity guard claimed that obscene language was used at him\nand that beer had been spilt on\nthe floor. The miscreants denied\nthese charges but admitted taking\na jug of beer into the lounge,\nwhere they played cards and decided to stay the night when it\nstarted raining.\nAnother person who was seen\nto throw a chair on to the stage\nat the end of the Smoking Concert, and was stopped by Mike\nTait, Vice-President of RCS from\nthrowing another, was suspended\nfor ten days, a second one who\nadmitted throwing beer but no\nchairs, glasses or bottles was cautioned. These two were unfortunate in that they were the only\ntwo out of a fair number of\npeople who were identified.\nAlthough discussion of the\ncases was in camera it is reliably\nreported that some members of\nCouncil tried to have the sentences of the two who slept in\nICWA lounge postponed because\nit might prejudice the chances of\nIC Rugby Club (people under\nsuspension are not eligible to\nplay for IC teams or take part in\nthe activities of clubs).\nRSM RUGBY HITS PARIS\nThe R.S. M. Rugby Club were\nin Paris for the weekend of the\nFrance-England International, as\nguests of the Ecole des Mines de\nParis.\nThe short tour began in Southside at 9.00 on the Friday morning somewhat surprisingly with\nnobody late. Having boarded the\ntrain at Victoria, except for one\nor two incidents, the party of 21\nMinesmen and one distinguished\nmember of the RCS\u2014who for\nthe sake of anonymity will hereafter be referred to as Mr. Smith,\nproceeded to quietly drink its wa,y down to Newhaven, whilst playing\n500.\nAround 12.00, the boat sailed\nfrom Newhaven for Dieppe, the\nentire party by this time being\nwell established in the bar. The\nFrench Beer was going down very\nwell, but not as well as the Ricard.\nAs the crossing lasts about four\nhours, one can fully imagine that\na good time was had by all, including the gentleman who gene-rou sly, but rather stupidly, surrendered his trousers into the\neager hands of Mr. Wells.\nThe first major incident of the\ntour occurred at Dieppe when\none of our number, who shall be\nnameless, struck a member of the\nlocal gendarme rie in the region of\nhis lower abdomen. The claim of\nself-defence was not accepted,\nand our much maligned comrade\neventually rejoined us in Paris on\nthe Sunday afternoon.\nDespite the distraction of a rather randy Russian Ladv the remaining 21 arrived in Paris at\nabout 6.30. Our hosts met us at\nSt. Lazare station, and quickly\nsettled us in at the Maison des\nMines. At this junction, Mr.\nWells retired to bed.\nAllez\nThe early part of the Friday\nevening was occupied with a tour\nof one or two of the loc a i1 bars.\nIn one particular bar, Mr. Smith's experiments with hard-boiled eggs\namused all but the good landlady who somewhat bluntly asked\nus to \" Allez.\"\nThe latter part of the evening\nwas spent at a dance given in our\nhonour. Everyone thoroughly\nenjoyed this, but none more than\nMr. Smith, whose exhibition on\nthe Billiard Table remains a priceless memory. So, too, does\nhis rapid disappearance to bed\nshortly afterwards.\nAbout this time, the episode involving \" Le phantom piss eur\" is thought to have occured. Subsequent investigation and reconstruction of the episode revealed\nlittle except that Mr. Smith, for a change was not involved.\nRumour has it that by 3.30\non Saturday morning, everyone\nwas in bed.\nRugby for some\nSaturday morning saw 18 very\ntired Minesmen attempting to\nplay rugby, against an enthusiastic if not over talented Paris side.\nFor the record, in an uninspiring\ngame, Mr. Greetham led his side\nto victory by 11 points to 9. It is\nalso worth noting that having\nbeen sent off the field, after ten\nminutes, by both captains, and\ndisowned by the spectators, Mr.\nBurgess retired to the sanctuary\nof some nearby bush, where he\nproceeded to sulk.\nIn the afternoon, the international was watched. This was\nfar and away the least entertaining part of the weekend, despite\nMr. Smith's valiant efforts.\nand Gaol\nSaturday evening was an event\nin itself, but one weighed down\nwith one hilarious incident after\nanother, the \" hard core \" of the\nparty again being to the fore. We\nwere very well entertained by our\nhosts, who laid on a very good\nmeal for us in a\" downtown \"\nrestaurant. They also supplied\na little red wine. The meal was\nrounded off with a lively sing-song, and carrot, expertly controlled by Mr. Smith.\nOur hosts then left us to explore Pigalle and Montmartrc. A great night was had by all, despite\nan outstanding bill for a round of\nRicard, a slightly damaged ladies\ntoilet door, and a game of 500\nplayed in a gaol in Montmartre.\nOn this occasion Mr. V. K. and\ncompany did not go to bed at\nall.\nSunday morning saw a rather\nchaotic return journey start at\n9.00. Everyone was a little tired\n(at least) and heartfelt thanks\nmust be extended to Mr. Gunnell,\nwho performed the near-impossible task of getting everyone\nsafely onto the train.\nTo say the return journey was\nuneventful would be stretch in ea point but everyone arrived safely\nin London at about 7.00 Sunday\nevening, to have a quiet drink in\nSouthside. Concratulations are\nextended to Mr. V. K. who\namazed us all between Saturday\nevening and Sunday Evening.\nIt is the considered opinion of\nall members of the party that the\nweekend was one of the finest, if\nnot the finest, ever experienced by\nRSM Rugby Club on tour. Very\ngrateful thanks are due to our\nhosts in Paris, but also to Messrs.\nGreetham, Gunnell and Smith, for\nall they contributed towards such\na magnificent weekend.\nDAD.\nDancing\nIC Dancing Club won two\ntrophies last Friday evening at the\ninter-University Ballroom Dancing Championships at Porchester\nHall, Bayswater, when UL U were\nthe hosts.\nIC had entered three couples:\nKim Shim and Giselle Marriner\nreached the semi-finals of the foxtrot and individual rhum ba, Karen Gott and Nigel danced in\nthe cha-cha and Derek Southgate\nand Ann Everard won both the\nwaltz and the individual rhum ba. Two further successes were a bottle of wine won by an IC committee member in a raffle and the\nabduction of the Manchester University Mascot which may be\nviewed by appointment with a committee member.\nfi\nf1t Walk\nWalk\nWalk\nfor SHELTER\nDo you like walking? On Friday March 15 a party of walkers\nfrom IC will be doing a27mil c all nia ht marathon in aid of\nSHELTER. March 2-10 is walk\nweek for SHELTER, the national\nen mpa ign for the homeless.

    "content": "6 MARCH1968 FELIX 9\nLONDON SCENE\nSCOUT AND GUIDE WEEKEND\nThe weekend 24th25 th Feb.\nwas the date of the Westminster\nDecathlon, a24 hour assault\ncourse for venture scouts run by\nI.C. Scout and Guide club.\nActivities for the club began\nearly on Saturday morning when\ncamp was set up at Chalfont\nHeights, near Slough. Due to over\nefficiency rather more tents than\nrequired were borrowed from\nWestminster Scouts\u2014almost one\nper head. After lunch a number\nof lethal obstacles were erected\nfor Sunday's activities.\nSaturday night was taken up\nwith a rather hectic and supposedly friendly wide game. Only\none person was taken to hospital,\nand then only briefly.\nStlnday morning started cold\nbut very late due to the failure of\nthe only alarm clock in camp.\nThe morning was occupied with a number of incidents such as ab-sailing down trees, swinging on\nropes and pioneering in mud baths. After lunch came the ultimate\ntorture\u2014a wire cable aerial run-way. Rumour has it that part of\nthe unique braking system is part'\nof the infamous Guilds pedal car.\nCamp was finally struck in sub-zero temperature by the light of\nthe moon. The coldness of the\nweek-end was emphasized when\nsomeone tried to wash down a table\u2014the water froze before it\ncould run off. The hunt r rv masses then proceeded to \" 129.\" the\nflat of one of the club members\nwhere 2\\ dozen eggs, un account, ably unbroken in one of Sunday's incidents were consumed. It is\nfair to say the real winner was the\nweather.\nThe London club scene is\ndying as fast as the word hop\nat IC. Where can you now find\nscenes to match Georgie Fame\nud the Blue Flames at the\nFlamingo, Zoot Money's Big\nRoll Band at Klook's Kleek, Cyril\nDavies and Alexis Korner, the\nYardbirds or tie Rolling Stones\nat the Marquee, or, more re-cent ly, the Pink Floyd or Tomorrow at UFO ? Whatever\nhappened to the Scene, Scotch of\nSt. lames, Tiles, UFO, the\nRoundhouse or Bag o' Nails ?\nWhat has killed the London\nclub scene\u2014braces, flat-topped\nhair styles, flared trousers, Vidal\nSassoon or just apathy? The real\nanswer lies in the fact that the\ndemand for genuine music has\ndied out. Each club has its own\nlittle in-set of gro o vies: the Bluesville mod dies, the Flamingo colo-ni als, the Middle Earth hippies\nand the Marquee drudge. The\nmod dies killed UFO, the hippies\nkilled the blues clubs, they joined\nhands to kill the Marquee and all\nare now hammering at the doors\nof the Speakeasy.\nLondon Dead\nA leading A.&R. man once\nsaid to me \" the London scene is\ndead, I'm going back to America\nwhere the small groups are worth\nwatching.\" This just is not true.\nFantastic groups are springing up\nevery week\u2014Ten Years After,\nAynsley Dunbar Retaliation,\nDantalians Chariot, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Spooky Tooth, the\nFairport Convention, to name but\na few. Why are these groups not\ngetting the wild receptions they\ndeserve? Simply because the average person's comprehension of\nanything more profound than the\ncolour of the lead guitarist's trousers is practically non-existent.\nRemember five hundred people\nswinging with Georgie Fame?\nYOU'RE A GOOD MAN\nCHARLiE\nBROWN\nReviewed by\nJohn Mullaly\nTruly Charles M. Schulz of \" Peanuts \" fame must be a wealthy\nman. In addition to appearing in newspapers throughout the USA\nand Britain, his strip cartoon has fathered two smash-hit records\n(remember \"Charlie Brown\" by The Coasters?) and a series of coffee-table books (Happiness is\u2014, Security is\u2014, et al). Finally the ultimate\nhas appeared\u2014a musical entertainment, no less! and given the chance\nto review it, FELIX could hardly refuse. So.\n\" You're a good man, Charlie Brown \" is presently appearing at\nthe Fortune Theatre and I must, in all honesty, report that nothing\nin the show matches the excellence of the strip cartoon to any degree.\nThe same dry line in humour, gently probing the weaknesses and\nfoibles of Schulz's six characters is still there, for the story line is\nnothing more than a sequence of the cartoons acted out on the stage,\ninterspersed with a little song and dance. Charlie Brown never gets\nto talk to that cute little red-head, never makes it to home base;\nSnoopy curses his Red Baron from the top of his kennel; Lucy\nscreeches romantic love at a piano-playing Schroeder. Yet the wit of\nthe cartoons has vanished in the transformation to the stage. The cast,\nafter all, consists of a group of adults masquerading as a group of\nchildren masquerading (very often) as a group of adults. Without as\nmuch as a tail as a prop, masquerading as dog Snoopy is an even\ntougher assignment. In trying too hard to make contact with the\naudience the show loses the subtle quality of Schulz's humour. Neither\ncan it offer the appeal of \" the cute way kids have with them.\" Even\nthe music fails to bring the show to life, being a series of forgettable\ntunes around moderately interesting lyrics. Nourished by the Daily\nSketch on hi-grade \" Peanuts,\" I found \" You're a good man, Charlie\nBrown \" disappointingly tasteless.\nYet there were some good moments. Snoopy's duel with the Red\nBaron comes off well, mainly because the whole thing has already\nbeen fully documented. From time to time Charlie Brown and Lucy\nscratch and pick at a sore of great amusement in the apparent compulsion of Americans to analyse one another. Unfortunately the show\nends on a note of sch lopp y schmaltz with the song \" Happiness\" (is\na thumb and a blanket). Curiously enough the audience quite appreciated this sugared curtain-closer, on the night I went. As far as I could\nmake out it was, like the show, almost entirely American.\nNow a titter might arise from\nthe stalls when Alvin Lee shatters\nhis seventy-ninth plectrum. Remember an Eric Clapton solo\nwith the Yardbirds? Now, a fifteen year old teeny-bopper collapses in ecstasy as Carle Wayne\nof the Move rams the microphone\nstand into his crotch. A group\ndoes not stand a chance now\nunless they are called Aluminium\nMargarine, feature two sitars and\na boog lie and the lead singer has\nbeen out with Twiggy.\nAre the clubs doing anything\nabout this state of affairs? In the\npulsating depths of a San Francisco summer the Flamingo, one\nof the all time great blues clubs,\nchanged its name to the Pink\nFlamingo and closed the lid over\na great tradition of music. As\nthe teeny-bopper s bought their\nbells on the winkle stands of\nSouthend, UFO went back under-ground, the rent collectors seized\nTiles and so on.\nOne can count the successful\nclubs on the fingers of one hand.\nThe Marquee continues to put on\nattractive groups but even they\nhave lost the knack of turning\nyoung guitarists into professional\nmusicians. Supreme at the top\nreigns the Speakeasy. How do\nthey do it? Simple\u2014restrict the\nmembership.\nPETE NICHOLLS\nWIZZ \u2022\u2022\u2022\n\" Don Partridge used to bottle\nfor me.\" So said Wizz Jones,\nlast Wednesday's guest at the\nFolk Club. Ha plays contemporary tunes and is concentrating\nmore on his guitar playing than\non his singing at the moment. In\nfact in the first half he played\n\" the only ' folk song' of his\nrep e to ire\" which he had written\nhimself. He has been a professional artist for ten years. He\nbegan his career in 1957 busking\noutside the Warner cinema. Then\nafter a summer in Cornwall toured\nEurope and North Africa bus k ing. He gave that up because of\ntoo much \" student competition.\"\nWhen he returned to Europe he\n\" discovered \" the folk clubs and\nhas been playing at them ever\nsince. He now plays solo but\nused to play with Pete Stanley,\na blue brass banjo player. Unlike\nDon Partridge, Popdom did not\ncome his way although he and\nPete Stanley did make a Bob\nDylan single\u2014before anyone had\nheard of Bob Dylan!\nHe performed in the first half\nto a small and quiet audience. By\nthe second half however, this had\nincreased in both number and\nvolume. The performance of\nWizz, and of the resident performers improved as audience\nparticipation became more lively.\nThe standard was perhaps no jt as\nhigh as is normal at Fell. Club but\nit was none th\" less enjoyable.\nHe was ably supported by the\nresident artists and a good time\nwas had by all.\nDrug;\nat IF j0 The International Ft ions Club held a poorly attend' ne et ing on Drugs on Mondi.\u201e -22nd February, with William Deedes\nMP, speaking and with a showing\nof the American film \" Hooked.\"\nMr. Deedes began his talk with\na run-through of the various kinds\nof drugs at present in use and\nwith an outline of the new\nDangerous Drugs Act. According to him, the main anomaly of\nthe drugs legislation at the moment is the way marihuana is\nclassified under the 1965 Dangerous Drugs Act whereas LSD, a far more dangerous drug, is\nmerely mentioned in the less\nstringent 1964 Misuse of Drugs\nAct. Informed medical and social opinion leads him to believe\nthat these two drugs should be\ninterchanged.\nSocial Problems\nMore important, however, is\nthe social problem presented by\nthe taking of drugs. T'ier e is a point, as Mr. Deedes said, beyond\nwhich you can't legislate against\npeople doing something they\nreally want to do, so education\nmust undoubtedly start to fill a larger role in the fight against the\ndrugs menace.\nNew problems always present\nthemselves to the social worker.\nRecently there has been an upsurge of people only \" fixing \" oc-casio n ally. It is a relatively\nlittle-investigated topic as to\nwhether occasional taking of the\n\" hard \" drugs heroin and cocaine\neventually lead to addiction. Then\nagain there is a social t work unhelpful to doctors and che-mists, etc., where addicts 1\ntogether and sell narcotics\namongst themselves. Mr. Deedes\nbelieves that there are about 4000\ndrug addicts in London at the\nmoment, and unless the new act\nhas an immediate and profound\neffect, this number \u00abill be as ron om ical by Y71. COUNCIL The election for the vacancy n Council caused by Malcolm\n\" Spooks \" Duckett's resignation\nwill be held at the next Union\nmeeting on Thursday, larch\n14th. Favourite at the moment\nis Rob Collinge, who stood at the\nend of last year and was defeated.\nIt is believed that Ian Wells is attempting to get a Miner to stand.\nNominations close on Tuesday.\nBusiness to be discussed include the Boothman/Duckett\nre-or<Mnis;''i or> of the whole\nUmuu struct,\u201e and l?r wr tv, motion to have another Constituent College rep on Council.\nAIRPLANE, DOORS FOR I.C.? Continued from page 1\nThe Jefferson Airplane are the leaders of the folk-rock type of\nmusic and feature the incredible voice of .Grace Slick, an ex-folk\nsinger. They have had three singles released in Britain : \" White\nRabbit\" (which was a big hit in the States), \" Somebody to Love,\"\nand the \" Ballad of You and Me an Pooneil,\" and an LP, \" Surrealistic Pillow.\"\nWhile the Airplane are trying to adapt and fuse together the\nidioms of folk-music and rock-'n roll, the Doors are trying, both\nlyrically and instrumentally, to evolve something completely different\nfrom pop music at present. Their lyrics and singing, full of poetic\nimagery, may leave something to be desired (although infinitely better\nthan the lyric of the standard pop love song, which is at last fading)\nbut they have few peers in their superbly imaginative instrumental\nimprovisations. On their first LP, \" The Doors,\" the addition of a three-minute instrumental passage to the million selling American\nNo. 1, \" Light My Fire,\" transforms it from a well above average pop\nsong to some of the best pop music at present available. In addition\nto \" Light My Fire,\" which had small success, they have had two\nother singles released here; \" Break on Through,\" also from their\nfirst LP and \" People are Strange \" from their latest LP\" Strange\nDays,\" which was released recently.\nEnts expect the hop to cost them about $1,000 (\u00a3417) and if they\ncan bring one or both groups to IC will scoop all London colleges and\npossibly all Universities as well\nThe two groups are booked to do one concert to ge. jr in the\nAlbert Hall on Easter Saturday, March 13th.

    "content": "FELIX6 MARCH1961 A series in which articles are\ninvited on subjects dear to the\nwriters' hearts.\nThe Parkinson\nCorbyn Laws\nEntropy is on the increase, or more precisely the entropy id is or d cr) of any closed system tends to increase. This law applies to\nhuman as well as thermodynamic systems.\nUntidiness and \" disorder\" are declared undesirable by many\npeople. The reasons for this are not obvious except of course in the\ncase of room-cleaners who frequently suffer from the increasing\nentropy of books.\nIs there anything wrong with apparent disorder ? When the\nfanatical proponents of tidiness say \" tidy \" they do not mean well-ordered. It is quite possible for a room, a filing system or indeed\nsomebody's whole life to be both tidy and in a muddle. When a system is in the state of a tidy muddle it appears tidy\u2014neat (e.g. all\nother books and papers are arranged in nice piles perpendicular to\ne ich other) but is not in order\u2014not organised\u2014illogical\u2014difficult for\nthe \" controller \" to find anything in it. The meanings of tidy muddle\nand the converse, untidy order, are illustrated by a set of lecture notes\nwhich if randomly jumbled up and put in a folder would be a tidy\nmuddle, but if they were sorted out into sets for each course, and\nthen the clipped-together sets were spread all over the floor, they\nwould be in unti dv order.\nAs far as a person's life is concerned it might be true that the\npeople who live in a\" tidy\nmuddle\" are those who, considering neatness above all else, place\ngreat importance on their appear-ance, manners, and general\nfacade, they are pretentious.\nClearly it is more efficient to\nkeep systems in untidy order than\nin a tidy muddle but because so\nmany people are so superficial,\ngeneral social pressures dictate\ntidy muddle to be the form of\nlocal, national and international\nchaos.\nWhat about Parkinson's law ?\nHis original law said something\nlike \" In any system of humans\ninteracting in an organisation the\nwork to be done is spread over\nthe available time.\" This law is\nthe first of what I will call the\nseven laws of organisational behaviour and is Parkinson's Time\nLaw. The Space Law states \"The\ngoods associated with any person\nor group of persons tend to become distributed over all available space.\" The Communication Law states that \" In any\ncommunication the information\ntends to be spread over all the\nwords (bits to computers) which\nare increased in number to fill the\navailable space\" (this applies\nvery well to the Sunday Times\nand politicians. The Decision\nLaw says that \" Decisions are\nmade with the greatest possible\nindecision (as many options as\npossible are left open) in the\nmaximum possible time\" (wit-ness most Civil Service depart-ment s). Parkinson's Inertia Law\nis \" Human systems are implicitly\nconservative, changes being made\nas late as possible.\" (This is the\none that drives Leftists crazy.)\nWe have all met the Spending\nLaw which states \" The quantity\nof goods purchased is only limited\nby the amount of money avail-able.\" The Seventh Law sum-m arises all the others : \" All\nhuman systems tend towards\nmaximum inefficiency,\" or more\nsimply \" Organisational Entropy\nis on the increase.\"\nSystems become more efficient\nafter efficiency drives (putting\nthings in order) when organisational entropy is removed,\nwhether or not this is the most\nefficient way of counteracting the\nSeventh Law is debatable. I think it is more efficient than trying to maintain super-order (ig-more the irrelevant super-tidiness)\nall the time ; if we accept this we\nsec that the most effective systems (effective from the point of\nview of doing something) are not\n100 per cent efficient, that is to\nsay, no systems can continuously\nconvert ideas into reality without\nwastage.\nWhy on earth we should convert ideas into reality at the\ngreatest possible rate I will not\ncomment on except to say something (modified quote) in the true\nspirit of Waste Paper :\nDon't run if you can walk.\nDon't walk if you can stand.\nDon't stand if you can sit.\nDon't sit if you can lie.\nDon't lie if you can curl up.\nDon't live if you can die.\nPIERS CORBYN.\nMackman exposed\nIC Li F.

Is it just a cheap bed, or\na vital, integral part of a university education\u2014the answer is that\nas in any other sphere, living in\nHall is not just what you make it\nbut to a large extent what other\npeople make it for you.\nIf you insist,, your room can\ntake on the lonely isolation of an\nunfriendly bed-sit but with just a little effort from either or both\nyou and your neighbours it may,\nand often does, become the\ncentre of an active social life. It\nis for this reason that I feel it\nimportant that as high a proportion of First year students as\npossible should be in Hall, as this\nis a prime method of involving\npeople in social activities early in\ntheir university careers, when most\nof us have a larger proportion of\ntime to spend in specific non-aca-demi c activities or just sitting\naround drinking coffee\u2014or hot\nwater in the case of one of my\nFirst year neighbours.\nOf those fortunate few who do\nget into Hall as fresher s, the ones\nthat make full use of this privilege\nare often in a position by their\nfirst summer to reapply for a second year \" in,\" with a fair\nchance of being among the 15 per\ncent of residents who are usually\nre-admitted. However I feel that\nit may often be a mistake to use\nthe lever of newly won committee\nposts to effect a second consecutive year in Hall because having\nusefully used your first year you\nhave a ready-built circle of friends\nthrough which to maintain contact with the College during a year in the wilds of\u2014say\u2014Clapham, while still being eligible for\na second year in Hall as a Third\nyear or PG student when the pressures on your social and academic\nlife are liable to be greatest.\nWhen filling in the Hall application (see footnote) the inevitable\nquestion arises as to which of tii e ever increasing number of Halls\nto apply for. With one or two\ngeneral exceptions there doesn't seem to be much in it as they all\noffer similar facilities, if in varying degrees of modernity, at comparable prices.\nGarden Hall (with its proportion of double rooms), which once\nused to be the province of those\nwho \" wanted to live in a closed\ncommunity of men \" as one application form put it, is joined\nthis year by the new student\nhouses which promise to be very\ngood value for money at \u00a32 10s. for a fairly small single room or\nabout \u00a33 10s. to live in larger\nrooms shared by two or three\npeople.\nJoining student houses in the\nnew swinging Hall scene is the\nnew East Side Hall, Linstead.\nStructurally similar to Southside,\nthis will run as a cross between\nOxbridge Halls and the freer\nsystem at present prevalent at 1C The cost will be about \u00a349 a term\nwhich will include a compulsory\nevening meal 5 days a week, compared with the \u00a328 termly charge\nfor Southside and Weeks res i dents; this again seems to be an\neconomic addition to IC's Halls.\nWhile for those less well off the\nbasement of Old Beit seems the\nbest bet at \u00a323 a term, if you have\naspirations as a future president\nof 1CU it may be as well to get\nused to the atmosphere of Weeks\nwhere, for some obscure reason,\nyou will inevitably want to be\nwhile in office.\nAs food for thought, I finish\nwith the interesting fact that for\nthe sufficiently ambitious a place\nin Hall becomes increasingly easy\nwith time and probably cheaper\nas well and so recommend the\nfollowing stages as the optimum\npassage through College :\nFirst Year\nGet in by telling the interviewer\nthat you will accept place at IC\nif he guarantees a first year in\nHall of Residence. Once in, get\non Hall Committee.\nSecond Year\nHall Committee place might\nease you in but play an active\npart in some \" in\" club as a preferable bonus.\nThird Year\nChairman/Secretary of ACC/ RCC/SCC : this gives automatic\nplace in Hall.

    "content": "6 MARCH 1968 FELIX 5\nNATIONAL INSULA.< iCE\nAND THE SV DENT Delving deep into the complicated hand-outs from our Ministry of Social Security I believe I have at last found an investment\nthat could appeal to at least a few of the students here; namely\nthat of contribution to the\nNational Insurance scheme.\nMost students will have partaken of part or even full-time\nemployment at some time during\ntheir life. All such people will\nhave had, or certainly should\nhave had, a National Insurance\ncard. This card, the organ of the\ncontributory scheme, is also used\nto make the payments while at\nUniversity. Students undertaking full-time study need not, it is\nstressed, pay towards the scheme\nat all, unless they wish to do so,\nbut there are certain advantages\n\"And on the first day of that\nweek (referred to as last week in\nthe unauthorised version) the six\napostles, in the heavenly forms of\nthe brotherly executive, clashed\nmightily with the fourteen disciples, who were resurrected as the\nrest of council. When the six\nasked for more powers ,they were\nturned on with a sound as of a rushing wind. And they were not\nallowed the keys to heaven and\nhell. When ye shall sin, ye shall\nbe heard by the disciples, not by\nthe apostles alone. For the apostles are unlike the disciples. They\nare not typical of disciples in\nthese affairs.\nBut in some affairs, the apostles were in concord with the\ndisciples. For when Brother Pete\nRuhemann asked the gathered\nthrong to note the commandments that rest in the ark of the\nUnion Blue Book, the throng said\n\"Nay.\"\nAnd the day after the gathering,\nthere was a great clam our ing and the heavens opened above\nthe heads of the apostles in the\nBeit Quadrangle and they became\nexceeding wet. They and the\nwomen that were gathered with\nthem at that time. For they that\ndisobey the commandments of\nthat great God. the general student body, shall be s hewn the\nwrongness of their ways.\nAnd on the day after the Pancake Race, there came forty days\nof abstinence. And it was rumoured abroad, yea, even unto\nthe World's End, that Ray\nPhillips would give up the Presidency for Lent.\"\nIt seems to me that last week's council meeting she wed up well\nsome of ICU's problems. The\nmembers of the executive often\ndisagree with the majority of\nCouncil, a body which one would\nhope is more representative.\nCouncil often misses the point.\nThey spent too long discussing\nthe rewording of a working re-port, though all present were\nagreed what the sense of the\nwording should be. But they\ndealt well with the disciplinary\nmatters. It was unfortunate that\nthey deliberated on these matters\nin camera. Council took these\ndecisions on behalf-of ICU\u2014this\nwas a responsibility members took\non when they were elected\u2014and\nit is unfortunate that the Union\nwas not allowed to see how the\ndecisions on the punishments\nwere taken.\nin paying, and the decision to\nmake is whether the sacrifice of\nabout \u00a340 a year (about \u00a330 for\nwomen) is worth the slightly increased benefits gained thereby.\nBenefits\nThere are five main benefits to\nbe had from the NI scheme. These\nare: Retirement pension, sick-ness, unemployment, widows and\nmaternity benefit. Normally students do not immediately benefit\nfrom retirement pensions, or even\nsickness and unemployment bene-fits. This leaves Widows and\nMaternity benefits which could,\nand I can see nothing to the con-tr ary, be claimed by a student still\nat College. So we will deal with\nthese first.\nThe working report I mentioned was about Union places in\nhall. Perhaps it should have\ncovered a wider range of allied\ntopics. We have good halls of\nresidence\u2014good in a lot of ways.\nAnd a lot of the complaints that\npeople have about them have\nbeen put right. As an example,\nthe system of appeal against\npunishment from a hall committee\u2014a matter in wmi chI had\nsome personal interest last year\u2014\nis being changed. Previously the\nCourt of Appeal was the Rector.\nNow there is a lesser one consisting of the Senior Warden, one\nMr. Stephenson of Civil Engineering, the Halls representative\nand one independent warden. But\nstill there are not certain necessary protections for the culprit.\nWhen I, with others attempted to\nappeal to Stephenson last year,\nwe were warned that our party\nin hall\u2014described as unruly because of a trilling fire alarm\u2014\nwould be investigated from top to\nbottom. We had no wish to bare\nthe perversions of our particular\nparty to public inspection and we\nbacked down. But does the new\nsystem change things?\nAnd then there are the hall\ncommittee members who almost\ninvariably get back into hall for\na second year. Why? Most of\nthem contribute a lot less to the\nIC student community than a host\nof club members, hop runners,\nBow Street attenders and others.\nThe hall committees must accept\nthat there is no justification for\nthis discrimination.\nFinally, there is the question of\nwarden's places. The Senior\nWarden has one place in each hall\nand each warden has a few places\nin his own hall. The distribution\nof the individual warden's places\nseems to be done mostly on a basis of personal contact. There\nis no reason to connect the number of gliding club members in\nBeit or of Wells Society members\nin Tizard with the allegiances of\nthe respective warden and sub-warden. But it is/ bound to cause\nspeculation when certain members\nof these clubs got into these halls\nwhen they were not selected by\nthe hall committees. There is an\nobvious and very good case for\nwarden's places : they are necessary for medical reasons and for\ncases of financial hardship. But\nit might be better to give them all\nto the Senior Warden who could\nthen distribute them in consultation with the wardens.\nWidowhood\nThe Widows benefit can only\nbe claimed if the widow's husband had paid 156 flat rate\nweekly contributions, and also to\nget the full benefit, had paid an\naverage of 50 a year since the\nage of 18. Not many students\nin this class, I fear. Whether this\nlengthy trial period is to discourage recently immigrated\nPakistanis from dying on us, I don't know; maybe the Ministry\nis just short of money. But to\npersevere, the advantage with\npaying for this benefit lies in mar-r ying, and possibly dying, within\nthree years from now, even after\nleaving university. Your payments while at University will\nthen count towards the three year\nminimum and if contributions\nhave been conscientiously paid\nsince your 18th birthday, your\nwife would get the maximum al-low ance. Is that worth the\nmoney? Probably an insurance\nsociety could give you more favourable terms.\nMaternity\nAs for Maternity benefits, if a woman (or her husband) has been\ndiligently paying the contributions\nfor over a year before actual con-fine ment, the Ministry honours\nher with a lump sum of \u00a322. A simple reference back to the beginning of this dialogue will indicate that Maternity grants too are\na loser.\nBut before any would-be\nmother turns away there is a maternity allowance which is paid\nto those who have been in full-time employment for at least a Or, if one happens to be\n18 years 6 months only six\ntb our is required. If this\nther obscure, and it un-doubt e is, this , is how the\nMinistry words it:\n\" Fk ite contributions cou.\ntowards ,ne conditions for maternity allowance. Where, as is usually\nthe case, the allowance is claimed\nbefore confinement, it is payable\nat the full rate of \u00a34 a week if in\nthe 52 weeks immediately preceeding the 13th week before the\nMonday of the week in which the\nconfinement is expected . . .\" So\nit goes on.\nDole\nSickness and unemployment\nbenefits are only paid if about 18\nmonths of full employment is\nundergone first. The voluntary\ncontributions while at university\ndo not count towards these benefits at all. If, however, an ex-student becomes sick or unemployed after leaving university\nbefore 18 months of work are\nundergone, a\" special rule \" allows him or her to get the benefit\nanyway. The Social Securicorps\n\" pretends \" that the contributions\nhave been paid as long as at least\nsix months' work has been com-ple ted. A\" special inducement\"\nto enter university, perhaps?\nRetirement\nThis leaves us with the Retirement Pension. To qualify for full\npension at the age of 65 (60 for\nwomen) one must have paid contributions for at least three years.\nNo problem there. However, to\nqualify for the full flat-rate retirement pension, an average of 50\ncontributions per year from the\nage of 18 must have been paid.\nQuick arithmetic will show that\na three years deficit in contributions will never normally be made\nup to the correct average before\nretirement age.\nThis point, I feel is the only\nserious encouragement to pay\ncontribution at University; but it\nis not very serious L shown by\nthe following considerations.\nFirst, as well as a flat-rate pension one also receives a graduated\npension which is related to one's previous income. The loss of a few shillings in the flat-rate pension >ld hardly be noticed\nwhen .. j? duat ed pension is\nadded on. Second, a' probably more important, is i he fact\nthat most university graduates\nwould probably not be relying too\nmuch on their state pensions after\nretiring.\nGrants\nIf there are any other advantages in the N.I. scheme, they\nmust be very well-disguised. Even\nif these benefits are enough to\ncause serious consideration to\npaying while a student, \u00a340 a year\nis far too much. The Ministry of\nSocial Security cannot really expect the average student living\neven on a full grant, to be able to\nafford to spend \u00a340 a year for\nsuch vague benefits.\nAn extra item on grants would\ncover the cost but a simpler\nsolution would be to give all students free credits with similar\nbenefits and conditions to fully\nemployed people.\nThe R.S.A. policy of wages for\nstudents would also go part of\nthe way towards solving the\nproblem. Students, then being\nfully employed would have to\ncontribute to the N.I. scheme and\nthe size of the wages would have\nto be taken into account, the payments being compulsory.\nBack to the present system.\nFor anyone who wishes to find out\nmore about the N.I. system, you\nare urged to go to your local\nbranch of the Ministry of Social\nSecurity. There you will be given\nthe appropriate leaflets to take\naway and study. Read them and\nthen the choice is yours. The\npayment is surely a luxury, and\nis it worth it?\nEspecially with 6 years to pay off\ncontributions after leaving coll e2e CHRIS SLEE\nReading Mathematics?

A fantastic achievement considering the number of women at IC compared\nto UC, Bedford, Kings, etc.\nHowever, they did not win easily, UC were on top for most of\nthe first half which was goalless, being unlucky in not scoring on\nseveral occasions.\nIn the second half, after being a goal down, IC gradually took\ncommand and scored three times, a rather eager Miss Paluch knocking out the goalkeeper in scoring the first.\nMixed Hockey Victory\nThe U.L. Mixed Hockey tournament IO OK pi ace on Sunday 25th February, and after about 2\\ gruelling hours of competitive hockey\nthe I.C. team emerged victorious.\nPlaying on the very hard, fast pitches and in such cold winds was\nvery tiring, and it was obvious the team would have to pace themselves\nwell, in order to get to the final.\nIn the initial league IC drew two matches and won the third, thus\nensuring themselves of a place in the semi-final league.\nNow, the XI were playing well together, and they easily won this\nleague drawing one match and winning the others convincingly. Thus\nthe team arrived in the final against Royal Holloway College. Despite\npoor umpiring the result, a20 victory for IC, was entirely satis-factory.\nIn conclusion it may be said that the whole team played well,\nwithout any of the continual bickering that characterised most of the\nother teams. The defence did not concede a single goal, and the\nforwards had a field day.\nTeam : \u2014R. Webb, M. Burtt, Janet. Linda, C. Woolley, Gay,\nSue, I. Tasney, Dorothy, M. Ramsey, D. Roger, M.

CHA 6081\nA Microcosm of Apathy? PHILLIPS'\nINTEGRITY\nKIN SELL A FELIX Dear Sir,\nThe two letters you published\nlast week concerning apathy did\nnothing except underline the inability of these writers to produce\na scathing letter and the fact that\nthey don't like C.J. Kent. It is\na pity that the arguments were\nnot presented in a more mature\nfashion.\nI have always been led to believe that the selection procedure\nfor university was quite rigorous,\nespecially at I.C. How, then, can\nuniversity be a microcosm of\nsociety? Perhaps S.P. Chambers\nshould take a look at C. Tuxford's copy of Cassell's Concise Oxford\nDictionary.\nIs the problem of apathy as\nreal as we are led to believe? I think not. The majority of students only have time to attend a few functions of any one type\neach term, and are thereby\nbranded as being \" apathetic \" by\nthose who attend any given type\nof function continuously throughout the term. It is not a matter\nof indifference, it is a matter of\ntrying to fit everything in.\nThere is, however, a feeling of\napathy towards the Union. This\nis surely due to the feeling that\nI.C. Union is just a club run by\na clique, in this case I.C. Exec.\nOne way to reduce this would be,\nas C.J. Kent suggests, to have the\nI.C. President elected. In this\nway interest in the candidates\ntheir policies and the function of\nthe Union would be stimulated.\nIt is important that the students\nof I.C. feel united to their Union,\nfor it is only as a united body that\nI.C. can express its views with the\nsame force as N.U.S. or R.S.A. B. HAINES\nPhysics 2\nDear Sir,\nI personally have always been\nprepared to believe that when the\nPresident of the Union acted in\nthe Union or as its representative\nhe sincerely believed that he was\nacting in the interests of the\nUnion as a whole. On several\noccasions I have questioned his\ninterpretation of those interests,\nbut neither I nor, as far as I know, other members of Council\nhave questioned his integrity.\nI also believe that the same\napplies to other members of\nCouncil and other officers ol trie\nUnion and its various organizations : their many differences on\nUnion policy have always appeared to me to be sincerely held:\nand those differences have provided the debate which is going\non and must always go on about\nthe future of our Union.\nIt was, therefore, with considerable shock that I read the\nattack on (unspecified) members\nof Council and (unspecified) officers of the Union launched by\nPresident Phillips in the last issue.\nIn it he saw fit to accuse those\nwho differ with him of name-making and egoism, and effectively refused to recognize that\ntheir ideas might j be motivated\nsimply by a different interpretation of the Union's interests.\nThis unsubstantiated allegation\nappeared next to the \" Felix\"\nsurvey in which 60 per cent of\nthose interested said that they\nwere not impressed with the\nUnion Executive or Council. I would hardly think that assault\nby the President on the integrity\nof (unspecified) members was the\nbest way to improve this sad situation\u2014I personally would prefer\nthe method of open debate in the\nUnion on the Union\u2014a debate I have tried to encourage both on\nCouncil and in Union meetings.\nIt is perhaps unfortunate that\nyour interview appeared two\nDear Sir,\nOn behalf of IC Union Members\nSo 150 people attended the last\nUnion meeting? So 150 people\nare interested in the affairs of the\ntwo-dozen or so politicians whose\nnames were liberally scattered\naround the last Felix?\nHas it not yet occurred to Felix\nthat a potentially powerful student newspaper is devoting itself\nto a very small minority?\n1 have no wish to disparage ine\ninteresting and often highly entertaining personalities of the \" poli-tic ian s.\"(I am acquainted with\nseveral of them), nor do I say that\nthe Union does not play a vital\npart in the organisation of student\nlife. I do say that the majority of\nIC is socially lively and the\nvery reverse of apathetic (a word\nso frequently bandied around by\nthose who consider that anyone\nwho is not interested in themselves is living the life of a recluse).\nIC has around 80 clubs and\nsocieties, their leaders all very\nactively keen on extending the interests and broadening the horizons of the students of this College. Would you know this from\nreading the last Felix? No. You\nwould have the impression that\nIC is 200 highly discontented\nbureaucrats.\nUnion officials are necessary to\nrun and coordinate the student\nbody as a whole, when required.\nweeks after Mr. Phillips' friends\nwho believe that the power of\nCouncil is increasing and ought\nto be diminished\u2014opposed a constitutional amendment at an I.C. Union Meeting designed to have\nthe President of the Union elected\nby the general student body. I would have thought that this\namendment would have not only\ngiven the Union as a whole the\nfinal say in one of the most important decisions of the year, but\nalso made Council more responsible to the Union : aims which\nMr. Phillips (and his friends?)\nclaim to embrace.\nYour interview also appeared a week before the President (and\nhis friends) opposed on Council a motion aimed at bringing before a Union Meeting, Council, or the\nrelevant Council sub-committee\nall correspondence addressed to\nthe Union\u2014a motion designed to\nkeep both the Union and Council\nmore informed of what was being\ndone in their name.\nThis has, so far, been a hard\nyear for the Union and a harder\none for Council. It has been a year in which personalities have\ninevitably intruded into debates\nabout issues and *here, until Mr.\nPhillips chose to open the subject\nin \"Felix,\" debates about personalities have been avoided. I feel\nthat while the Union allows the\nPresident, Executive and Council\nto govern the Union and act in its\nname\u2014subject only to the few\nquo rate Union meetings which it\nsuits them to adequately publicise\n\u2014personality clashes will con-tin ue.I only hope that in future\nail members of the Union\u2014ana\nits officers\u2014will recognize that\nserious differences can exist on\nthe future of the Union, and that\nonly by debating these differences\nhonestly will progress be made.\nYours sincerely,\nPETE RU HE MANN( Meteor. P.G,) SLAMS They are naturally interested in\ntheir own personalities. No-one\nelse is.\nFor two years I have been prominently associated with a social\nclub that typically represents what\nIC Union means to the vast majority of students. The Union is\na vast selection of activities to\nwhich the student can devote\nevery ounce of his energy if he\nchooses. Through these clubs\nlifelong friends are made and lifelong interests are fostered. This\nis a unique opportunity that can\nonly be met in a highly active\nCollege such as our own. The\nonly shortage is three years of\ntime; the field is tremendous.\nAlmost any activity becomes\nfeasible to a fresher when he\nenters this College. Because the\nnumber of truly interested people\nis so large, these activities cost\nfar less than their counterparts\nin town or factory structures.\nBy all means keep the front\npage of Felix to affairs that are\npresumed to concern every student to an equal extent, j But\nplease don't devote the inner\npages to a minority of 150.\nI quote : \" The majority of\nstudents are happy.\" Why not?\nA large number of people are\nquietly concerned with making\nthem so.\nYours faithfully,\nSTEPHEN J. KINSELLA\nItOP\nThe editor reserves the right to\nwithhold all or part of any letters\nfrom publication. The views ex-pre awd in these letters are not\nnecessarily those of the editor.\nUN FED Dear Sir,\nThis is in the nature of an informative appeal.\nThe United Nations Students\nAssociation is beginning a non-organisation called the Universities Fight for Economic Development (UNFED). The aims of\nUNFED are a bit diffuse at the\nmoment except the broad one of\nhelping in the effort of underdeveloped countries to increase\ntheir rate of development. This\nhas stagnated seriously over the\npast few years and is causing\ndeep concern to everyone con-cern ed. UNFED wants to help in\nfinding out the reason for this\nstagnation, and, possibly, in suggesting ways of rectifying it. We\ndo not want people to say that\nthey are \" interested \" in the subject and that they want to join\nthe organisation, because we hope\nthat it will not be an organisation.\nIt will merely bring people with a common aim together from all\nUniversities and provide a central\nsieving and distributing agent for\nthe information.\nIf anyone is interested in contributing something to it would he\nplease contact me and I will put\nhim (or her) in contact with\nUNFED. You need n't think of\nanything of cosmic significance :\neverything helps, even if it is a small project on a very limited\nscale. I would also be interested\nin hearing from anyone conducting research in something which\ncan be applied directly to anything that would be of help to an\nunderdeveloped country; also\nfrom anyone who can suggest a subject worthy of research in the\nCollege which can then be applied\nto the needs of an underdeveloped\ncountry.\nCould I be more vague?\nRAKESH MOHAN Apathetic Orangutangs Sir,\nDuring my three years at Imperial College I have been too\napathetic to attend Union meetings\u2014I only heard of the Union\nlast week and was surprised to\nhear we had a president. Today\nhaving read FELIX I am a wiser\norang-u tang. Contrary to the\nopinions of most council members\nand Union addicts, I am a happy\nperson. During this year 1 have\nfelt no need for the Union and,\nsurprising as it may seem, I know\nthree people and one of them is a friend ! We have spent the whole\nday discussing this article and I have after much deliberation decided not to stand for next year's President for the following\nreasons : \u2014\n(a) Tfiare is no election.\n(b)I am un photogenic and would\nnot look good in FELIX.\n(c)I don't think ICU has any\naims, policies or ideals\u2014only\nmoney.\n(On second thoughts I think I will stand).\n(d) Because I do not need the\nUnion to bolster my ego.\n(e) Because I am not a power or\nglory seeker and consider myself a complete enough rer son without needing a Union\noffice.\n(f) Because the Union has become\nan authority against which to\nrebel and not part of my fight\nagainst authority.\n(g) It is too far to walk to the\nUnion.\nYou may ask why I am not\ngoing to do anything, about the\nUnion. The truth is\u2014I just don't care. _\nAPATHETIC CHEMIST\n\n"

He noted the Liberal\nParty were on the students' side, but said that NUS were still awaiting an official Conservative policy\nThree representatives of the student political organisations wound\nup the meeting : Fergus Nicholson on behalf of the Communists,\nPhil Kelly for the Liberals, and Victor McColl Chairman of the\nFederation of Conservative Students.\nAbout two-thirds of the people who attended then joined the\nmarch organised by the Union of Liberal Students down Whitehall,\nfrom which the NUS executive were careful to dissociate themselves.\nThe Action\nProposed\nAlready the NUS has organised\na number of activities in the\nGrants Campaign. The meeting\nin Birmingham on 7th February,\nreported in the last issue, press\nconferences, the LRO meeting at\nthe Institute of Education reported on page 2 and the Trafalgar Square rally last Sunday ;\nas well as a large number of\nevents staged by individual Colleges and Universities and the\nother regional organisations.\nThe first phase of the campaign will be completed by students and their parents writing to\ntheir MPs and by the lobby of\nParliament next Wednesday Details of this are given below and\nmore will be available around the\nCollege. Another meeting is\nplanned with Gordon-Walker just\nafter this, and if no satisfaction is\nthen obtained, the campaign will\nmove into its second phase, in\nwhich activity will be gradually\nstepped up until the final announcement in May\nThe NUS executive say that\nthey are not ruling out any action\nduring this stage of the cam-pa ign. Parliamentary\nLobby\nThe London Regional Organisation of NUS are organising a mass lobby of Parliament next\nWednesday, 13th March, at 2.30\np.m. Stewards are being provided\nand students will queue by alphabetical order of constituencies to\nsee their MP Each Student will\nfill in a green card saying why\nhe wishes to see his MP before\nhaving the interview in groups\nof six to eight at a time.\nFor more information see the\npublicity around the College.\nIC won six inter-College competitions last week. See pages 2,\n11 and 12.\nWhat the\nCuts Mean\nThe increase in grants necessary to bring them up to the 1961\nlevel was cut in 1965 by 40 per\ncent. Therefore, with an 11 per\ncent increase in the cost of living since 1965 an increase of 23\nper cent is being asked for If the \u2022\ncuts are allowed to stand until\n1971 then an increase of around\n60 per cent will be necessary to\nbring them back to the 1961 level\nand when faced with this situation the Government cannot be\nexpected to keep the grant structure as at present Several people\nare convinced that the Government will try to introduce a system of loans this summer. An\nincrease of poverty amongst students is bound to result (yes, many\nstudents live in conditions of\npoverty now).\nMore students will be unable\nto complete their courses as a result of enforced economic hard-ship. This means a greater waste\nof public money At the moment\nwe have one of the lowest wastage\nrates in the world\u201414 per cent.\nAt IC this figure is even lower\nIncreased barriers to child..t: from poorer homes from encoring Higher Education and receiving the education they deserve\nwill result\u201425 per cent of the\nstudent population are from\nworking class homes, a, fact\nproudly presented by Shirley\nWilliams at a Conference of\nEuropean Education Ministers re-cent ly. WHAT NUS ARE\nASKING FOR\nNUS are asking that:\n1. The other 50 per cent of the cut will be restored at a specified\ntime (next year) not when \" for the time being \" comes.\n2. Hall, refectory and other University charges are meanwhile\nrestrained (as they were during the prices and incomes freeze j usl over a year ago).\n3. Raise the Means Test floor from \u00a3700 to \u00a31,100 in line with\nthe increase in the average wage from 1962 to 1968.\n4. Remove anomalies in the present system, specifically\u2014\n(a) Discretionary Awards\u2014some local authorities will give a grand to a student who fails and is offered a repeat year\nwhilst others will not.\n(b) Postgraduate Awards\u2014graduates studying for a Diploma\n-\u00bb in Education after completing their degrees will receive a grant on the same terms as postgraduates students in Dili\nvarsities, instead of, as now, being subject to the same conditions as for undergraduates.\n(c) Married Students\u2014NUS asks that the ban on a dependant's allowance to students who marry or have children during\nthe course be lifted.\n(d) Mature Students\u2014NUS asks that the Department of Education and Science makes strong recommendations to LEAs\nthat they give Major Awards with full allowances to mature\nstudents; dependants' allowances be brought into line with\nwith Ministry of Social Security supplementary benefits, and\nthat previous earnings allowance rates be rational is ed.(e) Widowed and Divorced Students\u2014it is possible for a student\nwho becomes widowed or divorced during a course to\nreceive less grant than previously.\nNUS recommend the following levels of grant for students in\nLondon:\nIn Hall \u00a3450 ; In Lodgings \u00a3460 ; At Home \u00a3345.\nThey have been designed as a bare minimum to live in London.\nFor instance, in the case of a hall of residence the purely maintenance part (accommodation, food, laundry, etc.) accounts for \u00a3240,\n\u00a370 for personal expenditure (1/- a week repair and cleaning ol\nclothes 1/6 chemists goods, 10/- entertainment), \u00a355 for clothes\u2014\u00a37\nless than a recent Courtauld's Market Research indicated was the\nminimum necessary for a female undergraduate; \u00a335 for expenditure necessary for the course ; \u00a335 vacation allowance (as at present) j and \u00a315 travel allowance (\u00a33 more than at present to facilitate LEA\nadministration).\nIC LOSE\nMIKE AGAIN\nOn its first public appearance\nsince Freshers Day last Saturday\nMike, the IC mascot was removed from a crowded bar at\nMotspur Park, the ULU sports\nground, by Kingsmen, after helping IC win the ULU rugby\nSevens and Hockey trophies\nThe Wooden Horse Club will\nhe holding a full meeting in the\nGuilds Union Office 361 Mech.\nEng. at 1930 on Thursday to\nformulate plans for its recovery.\nAIRPLANE,\nDOORS FOR IC?\nThe Jeiferson Airplane Photo courtesy Decca Records Ltd.\nEnts are trying to book the Jefferson Airplane and/or the Doors\nfor a hop early next term, probably on Friday, April 26ih, when both\nare expected to be in England.\nAfter the Monkees and the Beach Boys these are currently probably the most popular groups in the USA, with big record successes behind them, although they have yet to attract the following\nthey deserve in this country.

He quoted one\nsuch report, which members\nfound difficult to believe was written seriously, though he assured\nhis audience that it was genuine.\nHe explained that many reports\ncan easily be shown to be astro-nom ical, often due to Venus or\nthe Moon. Failing this explanation he suggested that more rare\noccurrences were due to meteors,\naurora or even clouds. A fair\nnumber of reports can be accounted for by man-made objects,\nsuch as aircraft, balloons, helicopters and such rare but fascinating effects as aircraft flying\nwithout lights in order to bring in\ncontraband goods.\nParticularly interesting were his\naccounts of phenomena caused by\natmospheric effects like ice crystals in the air scattering sunlight.\nThis can produce memorable illusions particularly just before or\njust after sunset when the phenomena due to the sun could be\nobserved but the sun itself could\nnot.\nMr. Durham described his speciality on this subject, the investigation of effects due to lightning\nor tornados and during the lecture\nshowed some interesting slides\nthat could have convinced one\nthat UFO's really existed, but he\ngave a plausible explanation for\neach.\nPerhaps the only conclusions\nthat can be drawn from his discussion is that what we think\ncontains green men from Venus\nmay well do so\u2014being the planet\nitself.\nFind out first-hand what life is like as a Patent Examiner*\nYou would be surprised to learn\nhow interesting a career as a Patent\nExaminer can be.

    "content": "6 MARCH1968 FELIX US Universities \u2014\nChemical\nWarfare\nA public meeting on \" Joint\nAction for Peace \" was held at\nCaxton Hall on Thursday as a supplement to a conference held\nlast week on chemical and biological warfare. The speakers\nwere Dr. Victor Sidel, a physician\nfrom Boston, Mass. (representing\nthe \" Physicians for Social Responsibility), speaking on chemical and biological weapons; Dr.\nStephen Rose of our biochemistry\ndepartment, on the use of these\nweapons in Vietnam; Miss Eleanor Langer, a US. journalist, on\ndefence research in the U.S.; Prof. Eric Burrocks, Professor of\nPhysics, University College, London, on the social function of\nscience; and Dr. J. H. Humphrey\non the peace movement.\nMost of what was said has been\nheard in IC this term; Dr. Stephen\nRose talking earlier to the IRC\nand Dr. Humphrey to Wells Soc;\nbut new information was brought\nto light.\nDemonstrations\nMiss Langer narrated the recent incident at the University of\nPennsylvania when a student accidentally discovered that the Uni-'\nvers it y was conducting classified'\nresearch on delivery systems of\nchemical and biological weapons.\nThe result of this was mass demonstrations by students which\nthen rapidly spread to other uni-ve'si ties and exposed the vast network of classified defence contracts in many universities\u2014\nMichigan, Cornell, etc. At Penn.\nUniversity itself the faculty divided into three broad groups :\n(i) A minority which wanted to\nget rid of all defence contracts on\nthe grounds that it was misuse or\nabuse of science; (ii) a majority\nwhich said that defence contracts\nshould not be accepted by the\nuniversity purely because they\nwere classified; and (iii) the rest\nmost of whom were engineers,\nwere in favour of keeping the contracts because of the financial\ngains they accrued. (Later the\nPresident revealed that in fact the\nuniversity was losing $^m. on\nthese contracts per year.)\nAs a result of the students'\nagitation and the support of some\nof the staff, most contracts relating to chemical and biological\nwarfare at that university are\nlikely to be terminated shortly.\nMiss Langer had described this\nincident in detail to show how student demonstration had brought\nattention to a wide problem, and\nhow it was a great help to the\npeace movement in the US.\nAlthough it seems generally accepted that no classified defence\nresearch is carried out in universities in this country, Mr. Wedgewood-Benn, the Minister of Technology, replying to pressing\nquestions in Parliament recently,\nrevealed that the Ministry of\nTechnology is spending \u00a3900,000\non 525 \" aerospace\" research\nagreements with 51 universities\nand CATs. The contracts cover\nevery field of basic research, from\nchemistry to cybernetics and some\ncould have both defence and civil\napplications: 37 contracts for\npure research for defence purposes placed last year were classified. Mr. Benn said that it was\nnot in the public interest to reveal\nthe number of university staff 'ind\nresearch workers subject to security clearance. The Minister\nalso said that for the last 5 years\nthe U.S. department of defence\nhas been paying \u00a3395,000 p.a. to\n27 British universities for research : all for unclassified pure\nresearch. British exports to the\nU.S. of defoliants and her bic ida is have quadrupled in the last 5\nyears and are now at the level of\n\u00a32m. per year.\nJust Cause?\nProf. Eric Burrock propounded\nthe controversial view that he\nbelieved scientists were right in\ndeveloping weapons if the cause\nthey were fighting for was i ust He gave the example of the belief\nwidely held that the allied scientists were right in developing the\natom bomb in World War TI for\nthe cause was \"obviously just.\"\nHe even said that he thought that\nif North Vietnamese scientists\nwere developing weapons they\nwere right in doing so because\nthey were fighting for a just cause\nwhile American scientists should\nnot be doing this because they\nwere helping an unjust cause.\nWhile I believe that the Americans should not be in Vietnam\nand that the North Vietnamese\nare largely fighting a just war, I fail to see the logic in Prof. Burrock's argument. It seems to me\nobvious that scientists should not\nbe helping in developing anything\nfor destructive purposes.\nAnyway, let us hope that IC is\nnot aiding this country's( or any\nother's)\" defence \" effort in any\nway except in supplying scientists\nto the U.K. A. E.A. and to Porton\nDown.\nRAKESH MOHAN\nsoc sex:\nH ITS OUT\nA week last Monday evening, the Socialist Society met to consider\nUnion affairs. A report by their Union Affairs Study Croup was\naccepted without opposition. This is printed, with a few omissions,\ndue to lack of space, below.\nGeneral Dissatisfaction\nWhen there is general dissatisfaction with a Collepe Union which\npersists over a number of years it indicates that something is organically wrong. So it is with ICU. It is the structure that needs reform-ing. The time has come when our interest in palace revolutions and\ncoups which have produced the last two presidents, and numbers of\nother leading Union Officers acquires another dimension. The very\nstructure of the Union enables the top people to gain power by discouraging the active participation of tii e average Union members and\nrefusing to educate or inform him ol essential matters concerning\nhim.\nThe executive as at present formed is undemocratic without\nparallel. Those few Unions where the President was elected by Magic\nCircle have now changed to more democratic procedures. Of the\nmembers of 1CU executive only the Deputy President can pretend to\nhave any mandate from ICU and it can be said no executive member\nacts as if he need have a mandate from 1CU. The present incumbent of the highest post our Union affords was elected without questions being put to him, or even a proposal speech being made for\nhim . The election of the Secretary is a similar charade.\nThe three constituent college presidents also sit on Exec. This\nis a hangover from a bygone age which unfortunately still lingers on.\nAt the present time two of these three persons were elected in the\ntraditional manner\u2014because they were good chaps and could hold\ntheir beer. The third was elected on a purely const it u u ent college\nplatform and rarely mentioned ICU, if at all, during his election.\nOn council only 6 ordinary\nmembers are elected democratically.3 represent notorious sectional interests and 3 the old\nboys' association ! Another 4\nare involved largely with finance\nand do a useful job in this respect\nbut in little other.\nICU general meetings are\nnotoriously in quo rate. The numbers constantly amaze, and embarrass an Exec blatant in its contempt of UGM's. They fail to\ncall UGM's to decide important\nissues, attempt to cover up important information, mislead,\ngerrymander and generally attempt to pass the whole affair off\nas a joke. Mrs. Robb should present each new President with a copy of \" Citrine\" and a statement from the college solicitors\nexplaining what the abuse of\nUnion bye-laws entails. Still,\nICU Exec has one final weapon.\nNo other comparable Union has\nsuch a high percentage quorum,\nno other Union would regard\nhaving the quorum the limit of\nthe seating capacity of the Hall In\nwhich the meeting is held as anything but a joke. Unless the\nquorum is lowered, and lowered\nsubstantially, the Union will continue to be run by a few in their\ninsular ways.\nIt must be specifically stated\nthat the Union General Meeting\nis supreme and the number of\nUGMs per year should be increased to a minimum of five.\nBlame for Crisis\nThe old executive set-up must\nbe given the lion's share of the\nblame for the present crisis. The\nthree constituent college Presidents can be replaced by three\nnew Vice-Presidents, on the lines\nof the vast majority of other Students' Unions, who will h \u00abad\ntheir own democratically elected\ncommittees. The new vice-pre si dents would be Internal Affairs\nV.P.( doing the growing internal\norganisation work now managed\nby the Deputy President), External Affairs VP.( ii ea ding an\nExternal Affairs Committee of\ngreatly increased usefulness) and\na Welfare V.P.( working for\nbetter student welfare). It will be\nup to the ladies of the college if\nthey should wish to be represented by a Lady V.P., but we\nmust all recognise that the day\nwhen ICWA was needed to\nhelp the girls of the college to\nsettle down is so far passed that\nICWA tends nowadays to hinder\nthis process. It should be remember cJ that this Executive of 5 or\nC) will, like the theory of the present Exec, be only a sub-coin-mitt cc of Council and safeguards\nmust be built up to ensure this.\nThe reform of Council is\nequally urgent and can take c it her of two paths : (a) we can call for\na Council of similar size to our\npresent Council but require it to\nbe elected and to act more democratically ; (b) we can call for a radical change in the nature of\nCouncil and ask for a Council\nrepresenting most facets of Union\nlife and larger than committee\nsize. Many Unions have chosen\nthe latter alternative and we\nwould suggest a Council comprising :\n(1) The Executive (5 or 6 to be\nelected by referendum of the\nwhole college);\n(2) The thirteen department reps,\n(to to be mandated regularly\nby their departments);\n(3) 'l he Executives ol the Clubs\nCommittees (the big spenders\n\u2014about 20 persons in all);\n(4) Reps, of important sectional\ninterests, e.g. Halls, Overseas\nStudents, Sjlwoot!, treasurer\nand three constituent college\npresidents (if cot iiii iq cnt colleges arc thought to be worth\npreserving).\nThese then arc the recommendations of the Study Group :\n(1) The pie rent undemocratic nature of ICU be exposed and\nattacked\n(2) Union members be encouraged to participate in. and allowed to run. their Union ;\n(3) Executive and Council to be\nradically reconstructed as detailed above;\n(4) 1CU to join NUS as a fir*t step to aiding l he welfare of\nIC students and students as a whole ;\n(5) Th* quorum for ICUGMs to\nbe lowered :\n(6) At least 5 UGM's to be held\nevery year;\n(7) Ultimate authority to be\nvested in UGMs;\n(6) At least 5 UGMs to be held\nevery year;\n(7) Ultimate authority to be\nvested in UGMs;\n(8) All elections to Executive to\nbe by referendum of the\nwhole college;\n(9) ICU constitution to be altered\nso as to bring these changes\nabout.\nIt is only by fundamental\nchanges of this nature can we acquire a useful Union we can be\nproud of instead of a petty in-crowd we try to pretend does not\nexist.\n\n"
