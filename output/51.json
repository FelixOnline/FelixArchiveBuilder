In 1948 he claimed to\nhave won tha Golf Championship finishing in two strokes less\nthan the winner though he tore his card up in disgust at the\nninth hole.\nOutside College he has played for the East Lancashire\nClub at Cricket, his favourite and best sport, representing\nthe Lancashire League on Tour together with such notables\nas Constantine, Pope and Jim Smith of England and Middlesex\nfame.\nJeff's talents are not confined to the Sporting field \u2022\nhis mime of Gigli singing \"The Barber of Seville\" at the\nPresident's Ball in 1952 will long be remembered together\nwith his Sand dance at this years Mines Carnival.\nA staunch supporter of Lancashire he follows closely\nthe fortunes of the Duchy - his dialect stories being known\nto many.\nBeing a Mining Engineer Jeff, has large interests abroad\nand at the moment these are centred in South Africa.\nIf Jeff, t eaves college this year his friendliness,\ncompanionship and good nature will be missed by many people,\nhot the least of tUe.se vail be hi opponents or. this Sjicrting\nfield.

I can see no end to this sort\nof thing; artificial, synthetic, processed factory\nmade substitutes not only competing with the real article, but assuming its very name. We find it with our cheese, our coffee, our wines. All is \"processed\", \" specially combined with\" , \" specially blended\", \"homo genis ed\",\" consist ens l zed\", \"de- .\ncaffeinated.\"( I could even bring in the Nation's Daily 'read, hut since I have never gone berserk on\na genis ed flour, nor found myself exactly a package\nof concentrated energy on whole wheat flour I feel incompetent to comment).\nThe distressing side to this business is the\nway it is increasing, and it increases by appealing to the basest instinct in man - his damned\nlaziness. Our factory fresh food products,\ndissolve instantly, spread smoothly, are lump-free,\nscum-free, require no boiling,s training, overnight\nstanding.

From the sixteen crews entered, including two fast\ncollege boats from Oxford, the Royal Air Force end I.C. rowed their way to the final. At the start the R.A.F. went\nslightly ahead and maintained this position throughout the\nrace despite a determined effort by I.C. to row through\nthem. The result being a win for the R.A.F.a remarkably\nfit crew, by \u2022\u00a7\u2022 length.\nThe Junior crew unfortunately had a \"shipwreck\" in their race after going off well from the start and lost to the\nNational Provincial Baik.\nPreparations for examinations are felt to have had their|\naffects on the crews.

The lunchtime\nscore was 18 for 6, but the enormous luncheon was too much\nfor I.C. and Hook amassed 67. Hitchen and Willmor, a perfect combination between the rackets, opened for I.C. but there was a collapse and we were all out for41. Another immense meal, combined with a short bowling spell by K.

They\nwill, until the summer, be dwelling in Lancaster\nGate, and then go for a honeymoon in Switzerland.\nAfter the wedding they only took a weekend in Folkestone due to pressure of exams.\nFor the benefit of the ladies, the Bride\nwore (as far as the correspondent can remember)\na white wedding dress with a net veil. The two\nBridesmaids (aged 21 and Si) wore varying shades\nof blue. The principal men were resplendent in morning dress! An excellent reception was given\nafterwards at which the Best Man was kissed by the\nelder but not the younger Bridesmaid. The happy\npair were sent on their way to the station in a oar whose decorations rivalled those for the\nCoronation. A really enjoyable wedding; all best\nwishes to Neil and JacquiJ\nHugh C.

If you -re looking for as much humour or interest as you Can\nget from l/6d. worth of Punch, then you will be disappointed.\nPHOENIX cannot and does not pretend to literary eminence; it provides a training ground for young scientists who need a medium of self expression. That scientists need to express\nthemselves is incontrovertible, and is lucidly amplified in an article \"The Way \\head\", in the PHOENIX under review.\nJ. A. Lusher and 3.R. Edwards, who contribute short\nstories, display a high order of technical ability, but they\nshould both note that to tell a bad story well is only half the battle. Nevertheless, since neither of them falters until the closing lines, each produces what a more fashionable\ncritic might call\" a rewarding experience.\" Ken Glover, in a very readable fragment, puts in se me very effective\npropaganda for washing machine shops. That he obviously\nwrites from the heart adds poignancy to his observations.\nFor good measure, there is a Staggers Story, but not vintage.\nPeople seldom look for poetry in PHOENIX, but this time\nthey will find it. There -\\re two pages of pseudo poetic composition, but three lines of it, towards the end of the\nsecond page, are worth reading more than once.\nThe outspoken essay, \"The Forbidden Knowledge\", which\nappeared in the Spring Edition, has provoked a reply, complete\nwith a formidable array of references, in which Pschycology is torn down from the pedestal on which \"Rufus\" set it, and\nReligion substituted instead. Unfortun t ely, the destruction\nis done more effectively than the substitution, and we are\nback where we sta.r ted. But high power controversies like this make excellent reading, if only you would bother to read\nthem. They are the best c fall possible material for\nPHOENIX.\nA comparison between life in America and England makes an\ninteresting article by Pamela. Fry.\nLouis Cohen, in \"Science and the Press\" deals with the\nactivities of the Scriblerus Club, who spent a month cutting\nout science news from the newspapers. The results are\nsurprising and (to use an \"O.K.\" word) \"revealing.\" The\npopular press is too much concerned with unimportant things\nto have spa.ee for science. The blame lies largely on our\nside, since we insufficiently ej oper ien ced in letters to make\nour work intelligible to the non scientist.

Unim\nto tha grossly unfair and altogether Insulting way in which\nthe \u00ablast i< ais \u00abP the I.G. Jresidont is being carried out this j w.I should explain that I am the proposer of W. F.( Welly)\ntan, for tha pout mentioned and Is hall say at the outset\nthat It m vw vary good reas css s for doing so. Wally has been\nin a no oe a alva year* Secretary and Chairman of the I.

L.A.C.195253.H \u00a9 has had, therefor\u00ae, ample experience\nof Union affairs why then the unpleasantness of the\npant few days? Is hall enumerate the reasons which I have\nbeen given and sy answers, ( l) Although tha majority of\nhi a opponents like hist personally, they do not think that\nhe would make a good president - this is not a concrete\nreason, it is only a matter of opinion and mine differs.(2) Be spends too much time doing U.L. Soccer Club business\n- I as a Eugby Club man and an sufficiently broad minded to\nadmit that Soccer is also a good gao\u00bb and worthy of very\nactive support. (3) His eligibility to stand whan nominated - tally was, on the 11th June, a full member of I.C. Union and therefore eligible. There has been a lot of\na^w Val tng in t also which, by its very nature, is not worth\nrepeating. It is my opinion, however, that Wally is unpopular in certain o irc les because he is not the type to\nsay \"yes\" just because everybody else does.\nHaving, to my mind, amply justified my proposal, I \u2022 hall outline the very questionable \"goings oa\" in what,\nin my opinion can only he described as the \"Anybody feat\nWally for President\" campaign. The elector!*! notion\n**\u00bb put up a full sixteen days before the U th Juo*, m&it had typed on it that the noH&n& tien list would clow s at 5 p.m, on that day. However,the Lords of the Union\nhad no \"pet\" Candidato en the crucial day so, although\nWally -mm fully proposed and seconded, they altered, fan\"o leal ng date to Tuesday, 16th June, ( I put it to y \u00aba that\nthere can be no other reason for doing this). StSa.\nalter at i em was made just JKPTEK tha Union Annual General\nHsotiag (were the Powers that Be Afraid of awkward\ne^ Mtiena?) The reason given for this action is that\nthey have interpreted a vague passage in I.C.U. Bye-Lawa\nkh \"not loss than 2 days' passage\") to Man that\nthey were entitled to do so. I put it to you that it ww not a coincidence that the Lords discovered this era\nthe 11th June after all, the notice had been up a full lt>\nfay s! A seo on d candidate has bean proposed a full day\nafter the advertised closing date and I put on record a \u2022t* wtc objection to their interpretation of the passage\na eat loa od. It is the habit of lawyers in this country to baa o their arguments on previous ra linga in similar oases -Is hall do the same. First read C& CAr tio loa of\nConstitution, page 6 \"at least one woe*\" passage. In eff a ot, both references I have ma do swan that the\nnew in eo a fe a. ll he proposed and fully soo on ded at least a certain time before the election. Now let me refresh your minds, or tell yon about the Guilds elections\nef only a year ago. The nomination list was due to\nol oho at 5 p.m. on & Friday for elections a we ok hence\nla this case also, the Lords were unable to got a \"satisfactory\" candidate to stand IN TIME - but the list o looe d. Being of an inquisitive nature, I asked a Lord\nwh s.* tha position was m& his answer was quits definite there was, according to the Constitution, NO CASE AT ALL\nfar putting up a candidate after the closing tint on the\nclosing day. An interesting point, here, is that the list was closed when one candidate was not fully seconded -his second soo on d sr arrived a few minutes after5 p.m. At\nthe Union Meeting at which the elections were held, the\npro go J Mr a of the other two candidates were ASKED if they\nhad any objection to the other \"irregular* nomination,\nand, finally, the Union amber s we roi w ike d to accept the\nexcuse of the second second er that he arrived lat adua to\ntransport trouble or something. Front the o a so quoted\nabove I can only conclude that the alteration of the\nclosing time of this year'sI.C. election is out of order\nand that the list did actually ole se at 5 p.m. on June 11th,I consider that the whole \"date altering\" business is a questionable \"frame up\" which is not legs! within our\nUnion Constitution, and a thing to be deplored by all tha\nUnion ness ber a whether for Wally or not. A point w hio hI feel more strongly about, however, is that the whole sordid\nbusiness amount a to nothing less than a public insult to\nWally for no better reasons than \"matters of opinion\" - a tM.Bg wh i oh does not fall within my code of decency.\nTwo more points which should be recorded, both of which\nswell of high ps we rod dirty work - whether dirty work was\nin tea i ad or not. The first point is that I, as Tally' s pre^e ser, was not asked whether I had any objection em\nbehalf of my candidate, to the \" date-*!ter in \u00ab5* - I was left to find eat myself. The second point has far more serious\nimp lio at i aaa. I stress hare that I only suspect this te ha\nt nM, although ray grounds for suspicion are vary strong*\nDm decision to carry out the \"date altering\"Mist have boss\nwade before the Annual General Meeting,because the business\nwas mentioned to Wally (very indelicate) as soon as the\nMeeting was over. The dates wore then altered, unknown to s \u00bb. My sneaking suspicion than is that I have been\n\"silenced\". I am not a member of the Union Council, so\nthat I cannot voice my opinions there, except by let te rand where would that get me when the Council, I suspect,\nis hopelessly biased? The only way then in w hio hI could\nhave voiced my opinion in public before the elections\nwould have been at the A.G.M. and I was not told of tha\ndate altering decision, so that I could not ask questions.\nHowever, I do not intend, to stand back and witness a grass\ninsult to Wally - hence this letter to Felix. Unfortoaatol y, Felix will not be on sale until after the elections,\notherwise I should have had another means of stating ay\nease*\nI have heard much discussion from Wally' a opponents\nabout the wording on page kk of the I.C. Union Bye-Laws,,\nbut why discuss more wording when there is an obvious\nbreach of the Constitution staring them in the face?\nThere is written in black and white a passage which moans\nthat tha President shall be elected before tha 12th June\neach year - these elections will act be hold until13 th Juno. WILL THREE BE AN I.C. HRESIBENT AT THE BEGINNING OF\nNEXT SESSION?\nTours disgustedly,\nD.H. WALTERS.\nPresident I.C. Union to Editor, FELIX\nJune 15th. Dear Sir,I am grateful to Mr Walters for giving me the opportunity of seeing his letter and of replying to it im a edi at ely. The joint meeting of Council was delayed to June\n18th, six days later than the constitutional date, principal ly because of tha Coronation Celebrations j+. his is unfortunate, but would not seem to be relevant to the controversy\nover e leo tio as. The nomination list should have gone up 14 days\nbefore the joint Counoil Meeting and should have come down\n2 days before the meeting. The turtles was in fact put up for convenience with ths ether nomination sheets on 27th May.\nNevertheless I decided that nominations should ho\naccepted up to 2 days before the meeting.(Constitution*\nParagraph 7).\nThe proposer of any other nominee would in fact\nhave had the strongest grounds for complaint had tha not is s been taken down early. This decision involved alteration ef\nthe notice, wh i oh was done after consultation with ths Searotary, and should in courtesy have been oom muni cate d to Mr\nWalters as proposer of a presidential candidate. This was\nnot done, an omission for which I have already apologised i a private to Mr Walters and now wish to do in public By the time this letter is published a decision oa\nthis matter will have been reached by Counoil and the election carried out, and I trust that any ruling by this elected\nbody will have the full support ef tha Union.\nTours faithfully,, R.A.B. MAOFIE.\nPresident.\nD.R. Walters to Editor, FELIX June 15th. Dear Sir,I also an grateful to Mr Maofie for giving aa the\nopportunity of seeing his letter and of replying to it immediately and for agreeing for m* to have the \"last word\".\nI also take off ay hat, in pub lio, to the ether presidential\nproposer for preventing a very embarrassing situation. Everything mentioned in Ron's letter has its answer\nin my original epistle but I would like to stress one point.\nRon has decided to a ot strictly according to the wording of\none part of the Constitution ( his interpretation) so I contend that he should a ot strictly ao cording to ths whole\nConstitution, i.e. the President shall be elected before\n12th. June. This loaves a large query in my mind as to the\nvalidity of next Thursday's elections. I should also like to repeat my previous statement that it was rather in deli cate to mention this \"date altering\" business to Welly before\nit was mentioned to ae.\nBefore I close I should like to stress that al th on gh no punches have been pulled in this matter the whole business has been conducted in a very friendly Banner. There\nhave been long discussions but they have never been heated\nand there has been no loss of temper.\nHowever, I remain,\nTours as before,\nD.R. WALTERS.\nDear Sir,..... Having come to the Autumn of my academic career, and\nbeing desirous of resting s. while ere Duty calls, I find it extremely nerve-racking, when dozing in the lounge, to be\nwoken by noisy children. It is'. veil known that bridge is a rowdy game, and an exciting one, but some of our enthusiasts\noverstep the mark at times.\nRecently another disturbance has been caused by. flannelled fools at the radio receiver, anxious to hear the la test from the Test in the loudest possible volume.\nMay I appeal, Sir, on behalf of the o pressed minority\nin the lounge, for a little of the quietness which one\nexpects to find there?\nTours etc.,\n\"Pro Bono Whatsitsnaaa.\"\n\n"

    "content": "EVERY\nFORTNIGHT\nNo.SI. 19 th JUNE1953. IMPERIAL COLLEGE GUILDS SMELL TROUBLE R.C.S. IN THE SWIM\nMembers of R.C.S. who walked past Guild's just after\nlunch on 29th \u00bb\n.\nr.y were not surprised at the horrible smell\ndrifting through the doors, for it was known that the Guilds\nwere holding their A. G.l!. and Presidential Elections; and\nwhen you get several hundred of them together\nPhilip Allsopp, presiding over the meeting, sniffed\n\u2022\u2022delicately -nd expressed the opinion that \"Gentlemen,\nj thc reis a member of R.C.S. here somewhere.\" Mr. Allsopp,\n'retiring President, was presented, in token of his services,\nwith two books. Lest worse befall, suffice it to toy that\nthe;- were printed in English in France, -nd are bru t what\nyou expect.\nCORONATION CAPERS\nImperial College celebrated the Coronation in its own\nway. A large contingent chose to greet the Great Day from\n,( the e tree ts of London, with a heap of papers under one arm,\nand th outing \"Daily Hr.il. Everest Special Coronation\nEdition.\" Our reporter, up all night, describes the thrill of \"being a link in the chain which started with a brief wireless message, then a youth with a banner, running down\na mountain to the North of Khatraondu, then another wireless\n'message, then a printing press, then rae.\" Everybody in the\ncrowd was mad keen to buy a paper - one lady bough' two dozen\nto s it on. The police, brawny countrymen with a glorious\nvariety of accents were, of course, not supposed to read on\nduty. Nevertheless, \"Fold one up, son, and slip it under\nmy cape\", was heard more than once. Another paper seller reports how he entered a grandstand at Marble Arch at\n6 a.m., sold all his papers, end decided to stay there.\nAfter waiting seven hours a. steward came up and demanded to\nsee his ticket. The inevitable happened and he watched the\nprocession from a dreadful position in the street.\nThe whole idea of selling newspapers was to have enough\nmoney to go to the Ball. Excitement ran fever high, for those who were in the Union on Coronation Eve saw the\nfrantic and very noble efforts ra a. de by a group of enthusiasts in transforming the Lounges, Gym., and Dining Hall into appropriate arenas. The tennis courts too were\nequipped with dance floors, floodlighting and beer garden.\nPrior to the ball, a host of very tasteful and witty\nadvertisements had appeared, and a specimen ticket was\nshown. These tickets were master pieces of art and print ing, and the world flocked to buy them. We were also told\nthat we were to be allowed to keep t nem, but that, lest any\nv hould be used twice, they were to be franked on the back\nwith \"a specially made stamp.\"\nWith Borne eagerness,'then,I handed in my ticket at midnight on Coronation Day, and it was handed back to me,\nstamped. And how delightful to find that the special stamp\nwas a signature of I.C. Hon. Secretary W.P. Goss.'\nThe rain made a mess of ten niB court plans, and the\nUnion was very crowded, resulting in a little chaos,\nespecially when several hundreds had to stand for a quarter\nof an hour holding glasses of wine, waiting to toast the\nQueen. Mention should be made here of the Cad who set off\na firework in the Upper Dining Hall, causing wine to be\n\u2022pilled over many dresses.\n^ The supper, fresh sala on or ham salad, and wine, was\nvery good. In fact, a good time was had by all. In the Elections, Ron George became President, and Tony\nGill Vice- President, with Edward J. Taylor Hon. Sec. A clay pipe was presented to i. ir. Selby, oldest established\nmember of the Union, leaving this year. The previous day,\nin the R. C.3.H.A. C.U., Jim Anderson ha.d taken his place as\nnew President amid tumultuous cheers, with the new Vice\nPresident, John Hathaway.\nAfter the Union Meeting, Guilds assembled outside\nR.C.S. to start the Field Cup Race. Each department had tc\nmake a crown, and carry it in procession in a pal an quin to\nthe Serpentine, where a waiting boat bore it, like Iting\nArthur, to the other side, thence to be disembarked and\nrushed to Knightsbridge where Derek Crossley, disguised as\nan Ex Eastern Monarch, was waiting to be crowned, seated of\ncourse on the Coronation stone. None of the boats sunk th\nthis year (c.f. Field Cup 1950), although a number of\nswimmers did their best to cause a maximum of chaos,\nChemical Engineers won for the first time ever, Civil s being\nsecond.\nFollowing the base instinct of revenge, Guilds then\nmarched to R.'C.S. A witness who was inside R.C.S. at the\ntime tells us, \"The first sign that anything was wrong\noccurred when I \u2022** the porter rush to the main door, and\nbar it. In a few minutes time it became clear that the\nrabble outside was in a dangerous mood. We tried to\nquiet en thorn down with a hose pipe, sticking out of the\ncloakroom window, but water pressure was low and we only succeeded in wetting ourselves. Then the Guilds discovered\nthat they could enter R.C.S. by a side door, and in a few\nminutes a dreadful scene was displayed before me. Women\nand children were fleeing along corridors hotly pursued by\nthe ravaging hordes who brandished spurting fire extinguishers. Guilds also managed to get hold of a large\nhose-pipe, and they used it to great advantage on the R.C.S. corpses which were lying around. The building was almost\ncompletely wrecked.\"\nA V.I.P. who was in conference at the time in R.C.S. is understood .(FELIX Underground Hews Service) to have said,\n\"There must be some changes here.\"\nAnd the soaking multitudes agreed.\nLOST HOURS In connection with the FELIX exposure of a fila which\n(we alleged) libelled R.C.S.( sea FELIX 45 ), after\nprolonged negotiations between the distributors of the\nfilm and the Royal College of Science, a number of R.C.S. officials have been invited to a private viewing of the\nfilm. The distributors claim that the film \"Lost Hours\"\ncontains nothing which can be considered in any way\nlibellous. We await further developments with interest.\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nSo for, there are two%, fully seconded nominations for\nI.C. President.\n1. Iff.P. Goss, present Secretary of I.C.2.J. S. Harding, present President of R.C.S. The election of President, held at the I.C. Council\nmeeting on the day before this edition appears. If the\nresult is not stamped in the space below, readers are\nentitled to complain to the Editor, who will supply details.\n\n"

Circulation! 1200.\nAs the session draws rapidly to a close, we begin to\nthink of the sum.-r. er holidays} some of you might still be in the thick of exams, and as yet unable to dream away your\ntine. While we are all looking eagerly ahead, a quick glance\nbackwards in time will do a lot to encourage us.\nIn sports, the triumphs of I.C. are still fresh in our\nmemory. Amongst ourselves, Guilds took the lion's share of\nthe various athletic Cups\u2014 a pity ner hap s, but there it is. For the people without two left fee o, the three Carnivals \u2014\n.Fiesta, Nightmare, Gold Hush-- together with the Coronation\nBall provided excellent opportunities. We ourselves remember\nthe FELIX birthday Dance vividly. Though Nov. 5th was considered by many to be too gentle,\nall its shortcomings were more than wiped out by the Victoria rag. After all the tears shed in November, after laments\nabout \"successive Presidents presenting the Union with\nfait sacco mpl i\", it was a worthy demonstration that there\nis still some spirit left in I.C., that we are still capable of energetic Rags.\nIn January came the momentous announcement that I.C. is to be expanded to roughly double its present size.\nThough this will take time, we must start thinking now\nabout our future strength, for it is going to have considerable effects on the running of the Union.\nWell, all that is past. We hope you have pleasant\nholidays in many lands, and return to the Union full of new\nideas and energy; also, we hope, something to feed FELIX.\nIf this is your final year, may we discreetly remind you\nthat FELIX will keep you in touch with I.C. wherever you\ngo? FELIX is now feeling sleepy, and for once he can\nafford to relax, to ignore the goings-on. Just hear hi* purr . . .\n_\n.\n, The Editor wishes to express his thanks to the staff\nof FELIX for their excellent work.

Hookey Secretary!\nDerek Hughes is Rugger Vice-Capt.\nMike Piggott denies that he is taking out an expedition to try and scale the Sinkiang mountains, some of them\nsaid to be taller than Everest.\nThe FELIX Society reporter spent Coronation Day\nsipping cocktails end locking at T.V. in the t.'o or chester. A waiter in a hurry spilled a tray of drinks over him.\nCur reporter remained calm and unruffled, his only comment'\nbeing \"Thank heavens they were all dry Martirtis\".\n',000 students are enrolling, on the average, at the Law\n.faculty of Paris University every year; however, only 800\nstudents graduate from this Faculty per year (by obtaining\nthe \"licence\"). Similar ratios of students said graduates\nprevail at the Philosophical and Medical Faculties of the\nUniversity. (Le Figaro, Paris)\n\"Studium general e\" lectures at Wagenlngen have so far been\nattended, on the average, by five to six students only.\nIt is envisaged to shift these lectures to morning hours,\nas obviously the competition of other events is too strong\nLn the evenings.

AG.M. The A.G. II. of I.C. Union was held on 11th June, with\nnot many people present. ~ ie first important matter was\nthe rejection by the Union of a Motion for sending n Imperial College representative to the Bucharest Festival. On a show of hands, the Motive was defeated by a small\nmajority, but the meeting did not divide, since the President\nannounced that a majority of 100 would have been needed to\npass it. Presenting his Report for the year, the President,\ntalking about proposed expansions, said, \"The Student\nPresidents were given the opportunity of stating their we\nhope - representative views on necessary Union and resident i al accommodation, to the Governing Body. As a result we\nhave an undertaking that the addition of two extra floors to\nthis building is viewed only as providing the extra space\nnecessary for the present number of students and will not\nprejudice the fuller scheme proposed. This addition should\ncommence some time after next Easter.

Hughes, Chairman of the A.C.C. had an\nenviable job at the I.C.U. A. G.U. when he delivered his Report, for Session 1952-53 has been the greatest even\nin the history of Imperial College Sport. Ten U.L. Cups\nhave been won.\nHr. Hughes dealt with the increasing support of U.L. Sport by I.C. He regarded it as good policy, pointing out\nthe experience it gives, as well as the opportunity of\nbeing spotted by County selectors. The Rifle Club are\nexceptional, in not providing men for U.L., since if they\ndid the U.L. Rifle team would be the same as the I.C. team.\nEntering in the Inter University Rifle Championships, I.C. won, as well as winning the U.L. League Trophy.\nAt the opposite extreme, another team with a brilliant record is the Boxing Club, with one cancelled match to\ntheir credit. The opponents, of course, were the defaulters\nHockey, weakened by having 5 men in the U.L. team, were\nonly once able to turn out their strongest team. They\nfailed in the Cup semi-final, casualties of over loyalty to\nU.L. Rugger, permanent custodians of the U.L. Cup, scored 62\npoints, with 6 against them in this year's competition. On\nthe morning of the Cup Final an I.C.\" first team\" just missed\nwinning the University 7-a side tournament.\nThe Boat Club are in the middle of a very a icc ess ful.a son, and are considered to have a chance in the Thames\nCup at Henley. Fourth in the Head of the River, they have\nnow em bex ke d on a successful pot-hunting tour of th\u00a9 summer\nRegattas. Their successes are too numerous to relate.\nSquash, sinning 27 out of 20 matches, are at their zenith. At Torquay in their West Country Tour they beat a team consisting of an England player, 3 County players, and\nanother.\nCross Country and Athletics have both pulled in their quota of U.L. Cups, they are eclipsed by the Women'n Sports\nClubs, whose successes have been honoured by the announcement\nthat Miss Janet Findlater has been invited to join British Universities in the International Sports in Germany this sum-mer.\nGolf, not mentioned in Mr. Hugheta summary, have been\nbeaten three times in25 matches.\nA good season.\n\n"
