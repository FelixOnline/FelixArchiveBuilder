You have made\nthe messenger department and me very\nproud indeed. The messengers are always\nwilling to help and co-operate with\nStudents at all times.\nIt may be debatable as to whether I Realty earned this high honour. Perhaps\nyou are leaned a little towards me as I retiring to pension and a life of ease\n(wife permitting), on the 21st June,\nNearly five years I have worked in the\nBeit Complex. Receiving and despatching trunk cases. Showing mums and dads\nwhere to go when visiting. Opening doors\nwhen locked out of rooms. Re-directing\nmail e and a host of small things, done\nwillingly to help your stay at the\nCollege perhaps a little more please nt.I admire yo yr campaigns for Charity.\nParticularly the Cancer Research of\nwhich I am particularly interested as I was once, like John Wayne the actor.\nI beat the \"Big C\". During my28 years service in the army\nI was the recipient of 2 honours, but I class your Social Honour grandest of all.\nWhen visiting the College, which I shall\ndo, I will proudly wear your tie.\nBless you all\nYours faithfully\nG. Stroker\nDear Sir.\nI read with great interest your letter\nto Mr Wilson concerning fish and chip\nshops which appeared in Felix no.359.\nThe nearest c hippie known to me is at\nthe top of Elystan Street SW3(see\naccompanying map) which is only four\nminutes walk from South Kensington\nStation. The c hippie itself is actually\nin Elystan Street and is not to be confused with the attached fish restaurant\nwhose entrance is in the Fulham Road.\nPrices have risen somewhat in the last\ntwenty years since I first patronised the\nestablishment, and I suspect the quality\nof the product has not been maintained\nunder its new management - things have\nnever been the same since they stopped\nusing newspapers - but the shop is open\nlate on most nights of the week except\nfor Sundays.\nYours sincerely\nR. Halle\nAttention all you Felix readers who\nhave a flair for writing!' Felix needs\nall manner of people next year to\nwrite all manner of articles, reviews,\netc\".' for insertion next year'.' If yon\nthink that you are capable of pouring out column inch after column inch\ncontact either myself or Mike, me\nin the Union office, Mike care of\nLinefeed Hall'.' English is not a necessity as you can easily see from\nie rubbish that I write'.'\nUrgently needed is an Assistant\nEditor (Advertising)'. This job entails\nconning as many people as possible\nto pay for adverts in Felix.\nSorry but I 've had to\nfinish there because\nthe new type-writer\nhas run out of ribbon.\nWooden Horse\nOrganisation\nwould like to announce its reformation\nunder the co-ordination of\nMR DAVID SINCLAIR\nto whom any prospective\nmembers should address their enquiries\nc/o the Union Office. The objects of\nthe Society are to protect MIKE, the\nsupreme mascot of Imperial College\nUnion, and to persuade other Colleges to\ndonate monies to Rag by borrowing\ntheir mascots, such as they are. The\nobjects are to be carried out to the\nentertainment of the Union membership.\nDEATH I make no excuses for printing the fo low ing article in full from the Sun newspaper.\nStudent teacher Keri Hughes \"drowned\"\nin drink after a college initiation\nceremony. i. He drank a bottle of vodka to celebrate\nhis 21st birthday with 17 members of a group. And he choked to death as he\nslept off the effects.\nAn inquest at Barry, Glamorgan, was\ntold yesterday that Keri was presented\nwith a silver tankard by the group and\nwas expected, by tradition, to drink a bottle of spirits.\nBefore drinking the vodka he had eight\npints of beer at several pubs. Coroner,\nMr Williams Adams said:\"This was a sadistic, stupid, and un civilised practice,\nIt is extraordinary how easily and\nfoolishly a life can be lost.\nThe coroner was told the tankard club\nat Glamorgan College of Education had\nbeen banned by the authorities after\nKeri's death.\nA report showed Keri's blood alcohol\ncount was three or four times above the\nbreath aly ser level.\n\n"

    "content": "ESSEX Lord Annan, provost of University\nCollege, London, has started his enquiry\ninto the troubles at Essex University\nOfficially, the students' union is boycotting the inquiry. Many students,\nhowever, are ignoring the boycott and\nLord Annan has received \"an enormous\ncorrespondence from students\" as he\nstated last week. Lord Annan has had\nnotes distributed around the university\ninviting students to submit written\nevidence.\nHe has already seen trade union officials\nand chairmen of some of the depart-men ts.A meeting with h the university\nsenate has also been arranged.\nThe report will probably be published\nduring the summer vacation.\nSQUAT! Students were urged to squat in empty\nhouses awaiting demolition by John\nRandall, president of the National Union\nof Students last week, to alleviate the\nhousing crisis that would start at the\nbeginning of the academic year next\nSeptember.\nHe was speaking at a conference in\nLondon on housing for overseas students\norganised by the United Kingdom\nCouncil for Overseas Students Affairs.\nHe advised students to lok k around now\nto find empty houses in the path of\nproposed road schemes or waiting\nredevelopment. They should offer to\nre-wire and re-plumb homes that had been\ndeclared unfit by local authorities.\nAn expenditure of about \u00a3200 on such\nproperty could provide a home for five\nor six students for up to three years, he\nsaid. This had been done in Portsmouth\nand Southampton. The authority received-rates and students unions would provide\nthe initial capital to repair and renovate.\nMr Randall called for a single mim is try for housing to end the split responsibility between the Department of the Enviroment and the Department of Education,\nwhich is concerned with student\nresidences.\nMr William Roe, director of ac como dati on at Edinburgh University, said it was\nirresponsible for universities to accept\noverseas students on a course and not\naccept the responsibility for finding\nthem somewhere to live.\nNext year (1974 - 75 session) there will\nbe a darts competition sponsored by\nArthur Guiness & Sons, lie whole of IC\nis eligible being split into the following\ngroups:-C&G, RCS, RSM, Administration,\nHolland Club, Technical & Apprentices,\nMaintenance, Refectory Staff, NatWest\nPersonel, Union Bar, South-Side Bar,\nAcademic Staff, M.E.T.S. If you think an extra group(s) should be\neligible please contact the people\nmentioned below.\nThe competition consists of a knock-out\nsystem. Each group finds its best side\nto put forward into the grand final.\nThus we urgently require people from\nthe above groups to act as administrator\nfor that group. If no-one comes forward\nfrom a particular group then they are\nineligible to take part in the final.\nIf you are interested please contact\nM. Carey, room 133 Falmouth or Stan in\nthe South-Side bar for further details and\na copy of the rules.\nCUTS IN\nSTUDENT NUMBERS\nSevere cuts in the expansion programme\nfor polytechnics, which will keep the\nprojected number of students in British\nhigher education below 700,000 by 1981,\nare envisaged by the DES.\nThis has come to light from a letter sent\nby the DES to Dr Eric Briault, education\nofficer of the Inner London Education\nAuthority. The letter warns that the\nnumber of teacher training places in\nLondon must be more than halved by\n1981.\nThese proposals greatly affect a number\nof colleges with which IC has associa-t ions. Namely Southlands, Whitelands,\nDigby Stuart, Froebel, and, nearest\nto us, Maria Assumpta College.\nIt is proposed to completely close down\nMaria Assumpta by amalgamating the\ncollege with St Mary's, Twickenham.\nThe valuable site would then be\nredeveloped.\nPARKING Information was given in the last is sua of Felix on tha arran jam ents regarding\ncar-parking in the student areas during\nthe vacation.\nThe majo-it y of tha information was\ncorrect, however, th are is an important\nadditional piece of information.\nSTUDENTS WISHiN\u00ab3 TO PARK <\nN THE STUDENT AREAS DURING THE\nVACATION MUST CONTACT THE\nTRAFFIC WARDEN FIRST AND LEAVE\nCONTACT DETAILS WITH HIM\nIt is most important that students leave\ndetails of where y hey may be contacted\nat short notice. It is occ aisi on ally neccessary to move a car in case of an\nemergency. The traffic wardens will also\nhave up-to-date knowledge on the\navailability of spaces.\n\u2022\nAt last it's arrived! A Felix printed in\nthe college itself. However, it was done\non the col leg e, litho unit as ours is not\nin operation yet. It has arrived, however,\nand is, along with other items of the\nprinting unit, making life almost unbearable in the office by taking up most of\nthe available room. Talk about swinging\nths proverbial cat, you couldn't swing\na proverbial Moonay cockroach in the\nspace.\nI apologise for the lack of pictures in\nthis issue. It needs a special piece of\nequipment which we don't possess yet.\nIt is on order, however, and should\narrive in time for the next Felix.\nIt is rather difficult to compare this\nlitho ed Felix with the product which\nwill emerge from our own press. There\nis the lack of pictures to start with. Also\ninstead of being stapled, as in this copy,\nFelix will be produced on a sheet just\nlarger than twice this sheet. It will\nthen be folded to provide a tabloid type\nformat. Headings will be done with a spacial headlining machine instead of\nby iet tra sett and electric type-writer.\nAnother improvement will ba a trained\ntypist!!\nThere's not much else to say in this\nedit rial other than to wish everybody\nthe best of luck in whatever you\"I be\ndoing next year.\nGoodbye, P.A.W.

In\nthe season 1972 - 73 which was affected by the extensions the\nfollowing facts and figures will give you some idea of the usage\nof our sports ground. There were 51 acres which used to accomodate 5 rugby pitches, 8 football pitches, 4 hockey pitches\n1 lacrosse pitch, 4 cricket squares and 9 tennis courts. During\nthe '72 - 73 season these were used by 137 rugby teams, 217\nfootball teams, 103 hockey teams, 11 lacrosse teams, 55\ncricket teams and 15 tennis teams. These teams had 26\nchanging rooms plus 2 for ladies.\nHarlington has now been extended by 9 acres for several\nreasons such as to allow for better spacing of the various\npitches which tended to be rather cramped, and larger pitches\nwhere necessary. There has been an increased use of the\nsports ground by teams other than I.C. sides, although many\nof these have been from within the college e.g. st ucf ent house,\nsides, P.G. teams. This has necessitated the expansion of the\npavi I lion itself. An additional 12 changing rooms have been\nbuilt. The tea-room area has been doubled by the removal\nof two balconies which were rarely used. The kitchen has been\nextended and new equipment introduced. The extensions to\nHarlington cost about \u00a330,000, the majority of the money coming\nfrom Queens Gate Trust (for which we are very grateful)\nFinally a word of thanks to the numerous teams that have used\nHarlington and put up with the inconvenience which the\nextensions have caused. Also a special mention to Mr. (Arthur\nto all sportsmen) and Mrs Loveday, without whom Harlington\nwould not be the same.\nSoviet Railways\n40% DISCOUNT\non rail fer es to Moscow\n(for groups of 10students or more)\nHere's a special bargain rate! A real chance to visit the\nhistorical capital of the Soviet Union and its friendly people. This\nreduction applies to students travelling in groups of 10 or more.\nOrganised groups other than students are entitled to a discount of\n39%. These reductions are far greater than those offered by other\nrail companies operating from Hook of Holland.\nThis substantial discount amounting to \u00a340 or more gives you\nthe opportunity to have a memorable holiday. Remember too that\ninexpensive and comfortable ac como dati on is available at student\nhostels in Moscow, Leningrad and other cities.\nNormal fares for ship and rail travel are approximately as\nfollows.\nLONDON TO MOSCOW 2nd class \u00a3100-26\nVIA HOOK OF HOLLAND 1st class \u00a3139-42\nLONDON TO MOSCOW2 nd class \u00a3103-76\nVIA 0S TEND1 st class \u00a3145-58\nAsk your travel agent for details, or book direct with Thomas\nCook and Sons Ltd.\nSoviet Railways\nF LIX BO\nR OUCH As a result of recent disastrous events such as the explosion\nand fire at the Nypro chemical plant at Flixborough, and the\ncontinuing introduction of new technologies, the rector.

Hopefully\npeople w 'll stand na xt term.\nMy main concern since Xmas has been\nre lix. I have tried my best and I hope\nyou wore satisfied with it.

Every bopper\nin London phones me at weekends and\nevenings only to ask me about ENTS\nconcerts.\nRESIGNATION\nI feel that I 've done a fair sized job\nwhich was quite beyond me. As an undergraduate (Physics 2) it was very hard\nto fit in the dozens of meetings and time-consuming business such as chasing\nMr Mooney and Mr Seaford simultaneously. In my Council report I made some\ncon ment s that are rel event here.\nFirstly, I am still of the opinion that\nth are are too many hangers-on on\nCouncil, there purely for their own\ninterests (normally political) and with\nno interest in representing the actual\nviews of the mass of students that they\nare supposed to represent. Also, too\nmany people, both on Council and in the\nUnion as a whole are willing to criticise and complain, but will offer\nneither constructive com ro ants or any\nactual physical help.\nI should point out that th a seco mm ants apply just as much to the piss-artists\nwv\n\u00bbo spend most of th air time disrupting meetings by their useless comments\nstubborn ess and downright rudeness as\nit does to so-called \"lefties\".\nI was therefore shocked to hear that\nthe President did not consider my\nefforts sufficient to merit the Union\nGeneral Award which is the traditional\nmark of thanks from the Union. To add\ninsult to injury, rather than tell me\nstraight out the President sent me a letter.\nI had intended to get a job in London\nfor the summer so that I could continue\nas Deputy President until July 31 as I should and so that I could build a plinth\nfor MIKE and order next year's furniture with my successor.\nTffis was quite a sacrifice to make as I have had only three weeks out of col leg e since the end of August when I came up.\nAfter receiving what I consider aki q k in the face from the President I am\nfeeling a bit pissed off and therefore\nasked the Annual General Meeting to\naccept my resignation at Joint Council J on Monday 13 June. The purpose of\nhanging on till then is to give Ron Kill\nwho has most kindly agreed, with the\nAGM's approval, to take office from\nthen, some chance. As it is even though\nhe will have my Council reports to help\nhe will be being thrown in at the deep\nend and I would ask that you bear with\nhim if he takes a little time to work\ninto the job.\nFinally I should like to thank all the\npeople, both students and college staff,\nwho have helped me throughout the year\nand I would like them to know that it has\nbeen much appreciated.\nDavid Sinclair\nThis year has shown just what can be\ndone with reasoned discussion and\nnegotiation. We live in a world where\nthe ability to \"meet in the middle\" is an ecce s s it y to good relations bat wa en the Union and College.\nI leave the Union soon with few reg-ets.\nI have enjoyed my time here, had a good\ntima, made a lot of friends. Howaver,\nI'm glad that it'll soon be over. The\nUnion has still not got over its problems\nof lack e of active participation and is, I feel, unlikely to do so in the immediate\nfuture.\nIt is in your hands to change this.\nYour es team ad executive-elect\ncan't do it, however high their\naspirations may be. Only you,\nthe Union's members, can increase the participation'.'\nPaul Wadsworth\n\n"

He then came\nto a section whereby he informed the meeting that the president, Mr Sayles,\nhad decided not to give Mr Sinclair a Union General Award. Hence Mr\nSinclair has tendered his resignation. This was accepted by the meeting.\nFor the first time for a considerable number of months, MIKE, the Union\nmascot, was present at the meeting having been restored to something like its original condition, by some helpful Guildsmen.\nThe ballot for the selection of rag charities was also held at the\nmeeting. Ten charities were represented, and as a result of the ballot the\ncharities for next year will be Guide Dogs for the Blind, the British Polio\nFellowship and the Leukemia Research Fund.\nAs usual at the Annual General Meeting, there was the official hand.over\nbetween the old and the new executives. This was executed in the usual\nlight-hearted manner. Mr Phillips, the incoming president, had his position\nchallenged before he had even had a chance to say anything. The challenge\nwas defeated on a vote.\nBefore the meeting closed the new executive attempted to lift MIKE to\nshoulder height and sing s Hey Vivo (the college chant for those that don't know). T here failure at one was equally as bad as their failure at the other.\nMr Phillips nearly suceeded in closing the meeting due to lack of business\nhowever, a timely call of \"OuorumJJ stopped that idea.\nFor further details on Mr Sinclairs resignation see the deputy president's report inside.\n\n"

The net result of the debate was\nthat the NUS President was censured\nfor his conduct in issuing statements\nprejudicial to ths interests of the NJS\ngrants campaign, and that ths present\nNUS policy is now very close to that of\nthis Union (UGM June 13, 1974). The\ng ants campaign fo* next term is to be\nconsidered during ths summer by the\nNational Executive.\nThe Free Speech debate was held in the\nafternoon session (after a15 minute\nlunch break). In the opinion of the\ndelegation the substantive and am mend ment s2 and 3 were in line with IOJ\nPolicy (UGM June 13 1974). We accordingly voted against amendment 1, which\nwould have permitted violence and\nd is re up tion to bs used in opposition to\nfascists and racists. We voted for\na mn end ment2, wh'ch was passed b/a large majority.

This is to provide a list of\naddresses that IC students can go to at\nthe beginning of next term (if you're still\nhere then) in the hope that they may find\nac como dati on for the next academic\ntear. It will also help in giving an\nindication of the types of ac como dati on that IC students live in, the sort that\nthey would like to live in, how long they\nhave to spend travelling eye.\nPlease ignore the instruction on the\nfront asking you to return the questionnaire to the Union office by the 1st May,\nbut it would be appreciated if you could\nreturn it before the end of term ie this\nwe el if possible. As much rel event information as you can supply would\nbe a great help as this will enable me\nto give students more information about\nwhere they ought to try.\nI shall be resident in Beit Hall (examiners\npermitting) for the three weeks before\nthe beginning of term to sort out the\nquestionnaires and give out the addresses\nto people who wish to take advantage\nof this service. I shall probably be\noperating from the Union Office which\nshould by then be where the present\ntelevision room is. The service, however\nwill be much better if I get all the\nquestionnaires back, not just 10% or\n20%, so even if the answers to yours\nand your flat-mates are nearly the same\nreturn them nevertheless to Paul\nWadsworth or any of the Union Officers\nc/o the Union Office.\nDave Salisbury\nStudents Residence Officer Elect\n\n"

Hellyer Half\nA.H. Carus, J. Emerson, G. Kolbe.\nV. Phillips. C. Waldron. M. Williams\nThe fortunes of the cricket club have\nbeen rather mixed this season. At the\nstart of the season, three teams were\nrun every Wednesday and Saturday, but\ntowards the end of the term, examinations and apathy reduced our numbers\nuntil it has been a struggle to raise one\nteam. Surely in a college of 4000\nstudents, more than 33 people can afford\nthe time to play cricket!\nThe first eleven has suffered from\nrather variable opposition. They have\nto date, played 13 matches, winning 5\nand drawing 6. Only Hurlingham Oddfellows, whom the first's have played\nwith monotonous regularity, have beaten\nthem, thanks to one batsman who has\nscored centuries in two of the three\nencounters. The sides from other college\nhave generally been weak - its nice to\nknow that we are not the only college\nhaving trouble maintaining standards.\nFor example, L.S.E., once a cricket\nstronghold, could not even field a team\nwearing whites!\nThis season has seen our first attempts\nat league cricket, with our inclusion\nin the third division of the South West\nLondon League. Our record so far has\nnot been encouraging, having drawn two\nmatches with a third rained off. The\ncompetition runs to the end of July so\nhopefully we will have time to improve\nour standing.\nThe first eleven, though exceptionally\nstrong in batting, has generally not\nshown its full capabilities. Our\ncaptain's inability to win the toss more\nthan once a month has put the pressure\non the batting to make difficult totals\nbatting last, often with time running out.\nRon Gibbs has made the only century\nthis season ( v LSE ) though Russ Smith\ncame close with 98 against Wembley\nTradesmen. Gerwyn Edwards, Geoff Tate\nAndrew Hall and Max Taylor have all\nplayed useful innings. The lack of quick\nand penetrating opening bowlers has\noften been felt, though Gerwyn Edwards\nhas frequently bowled well with performances 6 for 21 ( v LSE - including a hat-trick) and 7 for 33 ( v Hook &\nNewham). Spin bowling has been more\nconsistent with the captain, Ian Menzies,\nRuss Smith and Geoff Tate sharing the\nhonours. Even our vice-captain, Rob\nYoung, is showing promise as a potential\nmatch-loser in this department of the\ngame. Rob Young and Max Taylor have\nkept wicket with great efficiency.\nThe Sunday eleven has had similar\nfortunes, winning three of its seven\nmatches so far, without a defeat. The\nbowling has usually been dependable\nthanks largely to the evergreen Roger\nMarriot, whose feat of bowling throughout the innings of the Harts bury match\nfor figures of 6 for 46 deserves mention.\nJohn Kelly has also performed well with\nbat and ball until injury and work\novertook him.\nThe Second eleven has usually been\nvery disappointing. None of the ten\nmatches have been won, and five have\nbeen lost. The bowling has been generally steady, with Ian Simpson being\nthe main workhorse, but the batting, \u00ab\n'\nthough potentially strong, has always\ncontrived to make few runs. The (captain,\nBrian Callender, with 56 v Air India,\nAndrew Hall with h86v Arnold and Nalin\nKulatilaka with 61 v Kings II made the\nonly major innings. If this side is to\nimprove, a great deal more application\nand solidarity must be shown by the\nbatsmen. With the loss of Nic Treen to\nthe first 11, the bowling often lacked\npenetration. The last few matches were\nruined by poor turnout of players, the\nlast game again s Kenton Traders being\nplayed with only 7 men.\nDuring their few matches, the third\neleven played some excel ent cricket\nwinning 4 of its 6 matches and remaining\nundefeated. The batting was strong with \u00ab\nJohn Andrews showing us some attacking\nshots that those of us who have played\nwith him over the past ??? years never\nthought him capable. Paul Newell and\nDave Faldon bowled well with little\nsuccess. Max Taylor celebrated being\ndropped from the firsts by hitting the\nside's top score of 63. Geoff Thompson\nand T im Hurst also put in good perform-ances. Generally the all-round performance of the captain Graham Webb, proved\na fine example to the rest of the side.\nI should like to thank the captains of\nthe sides for putting in so much effort,\noften for little reward, especially the\nclub captain. Ian Menzies without whose\nenthusiasm, effort and car, we would\nnever have ache i ved the results we have.\nPete{for-heavens'-sake-s pelI my-surname\n-correctly) TotterdeU.\n\n"
