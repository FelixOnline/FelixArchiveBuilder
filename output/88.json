The Commemoration Ball will be held on the evening of the\nsame day, in Claridge's. November 5th. Complaints had been received from the Athletic\nGround Committee that after each year's celebrations much\nbroken glass, china and even pieces of jagged twisted\nmetal had been found strewn across the rug ger pitch.\nSome fragments were extremely difficult to find and might\ncause serious injury to players. Most of this had been\ncaused by a few irresponsible individuals who had exploded home-made devices and fireworks.inside bottles\nand glasses. It was agreed that special precautions\nshould be taken if November 5th celebrations were held\nat Harlington again, including a printed reminder on\neach ticket.\nPhoenix\nPhoenix lias been discussed a great deal on Council\nthis year. It is felt that Phoenix should he regarded\nas an outlet, or club, for those in the college who feel\nthe urge to do creative writing. All clubs meet periodic fluctuations in membership, and Phoenix has passed\nthrough a particularly lean phase recently. It was\nagreed that Phoenix should be continued provided the\nfinancial loss which it incurred did not become prohibitive. An annual report to Council on the state of Phoenix\nis to be submitted by the editor each summer.\nOverseas Freshers\nOverseas Freshers are to be invited to the ordinary\nFreshers' Receptions, but after the usual speeches they\nwill be invited to a separate room to hear talks about\ntheir particular problems. This year's special reception for overseas fresher s was too sparsely attended to\nmake its repetition worthwhile.\nMew Union\nMost of the Union's recommendations for the interior\ndeo oration for the nev r Union were completed last session.\nHowever, one or two details and problems have been con-side red. The combined recommendations of several committees\nwith regard to the new Bar have been amalgamated and th\nlatest plans and drawings from the architect are considered satisfactory.\nWooden panelling of a suitable nature has been obtained for the Upper Dining Hall. The floor of the\nUnion entrance hall and the stairs will be made of.\ntar razz o, an artificial stone, and not wooden blocks as\nrecommended by the Union.\nThe enlarging of the absurdly small windows un the\nnorth-east side of the first floor will be oom ple ted without delaying the work as a whole.\nReciprocal Union Membership\n( The question fo I.C.'s reciprocal membership with\nother.college and university Unions in the British Isles\nwill be fully reconsidered before the end of the session.\nIt ia felt that I.C. should make its own arrangements for\nreciprocal membership, independently of U.L.

The people tend to be\nprovincial in outlook whilst they are also internationalists\nand have rejected in tem ation rj. resp on sibi lites yet have had\nit forced on them; they have had no desire for world power\nyet have attained it. The discussion, was thrown open to the .louse and the\n\u2022speaker was attacked by questions covering a wide range of\ntop los. Later the company divided into two groups and\nthe Americans present were called upon to defend their\nway of life, this they managed to do without conceding a single point. It was decided that both sides of the\nAtlantic had far to go to attain mutual understanding;\nin the summing up as tuc jy of 'Marx and Lftvin dogma was\nrecommended to obtain understanding of American foreign\npolicy. This was the first Touohstoae Weekend that the\nsubject was of a polit io al nature.\nLC, CXROTTT HUB\nThe Film Society has been living up to its reputation\nthis term in presenting an interesting and varied se leo tion of films.

But none of these can hone to challenge X U.C.L., who provided 4 of the 6 London men who finished in the firs*9 out of ,a field of 140.

ANOTHER EVANS VICTORY Once again this season has John Evans been\nvictorious in the battle of the giants. The occasion this time was the London Colleges Trophy Race,\nheld at Walthamstow under the auspices of SJV.E.T.C. The going was treacherous, and a Slow time\nwas anticipated.

LOSE IN EXTRA-TIME\nThe sera i final of the jU.,L', cup was played on\nWednesday, Feb. 15th.,, against i,.S. R. at Shenley,\nthe U.C. ground. The gro uh$ was frozen underneath\nbut had thawed out on the surf j ace, which u aide the\nplayers look like budding ballerinas with, tack e ty boots.\nPlay was very even to start with, but was more\nrobust than clever, owing to the conditions under-foot. L.S.E. scored first with a well-taken goal\nfrom a corner. Better marking by the I.C. defence\nwould have prevented this'goal'.\nBeing a goal down spurre/d I.C. to greater\nefforts, as usual, and gradually became just \"on\ntop\" of L.S.E.. For the remainder of the first half I.C. looked dangerous and goals were well\ntaken by Holgate and May, MANY MORE .VERE MISSED.\nThe second half commenced with I.C. in cont r ol with a21 lead. However, L.S.E. took advantage of a not uncommon habit of I.C. sitting back when in the lead. The L.S.E. half-backs took\nmore control of the game and soon scored after out skating the I.C. defence in one of the many\npas de deux,scenes. From then on the game was very\neven again, play swinging from end to end and neither\nside looking like scoring. Cup-tie tension built u if the game proceeded and several players tended\nto kick blindly rather than think ingly play the\nball. In this situation I.C. would have benefited\nby a seasoned player like Jim Anderson in the side.\nJ in had a set of tartan kittens on the touch line!\nTwenty minutes of extra time were o laye d much\nin the, same vein and T..S..E. scored a well taken\ngoal a few minutes before the end.\nPlay throughout was typical cup tie robustness\nand never reached a spectacular level. The, I.C. team was very disappointing as it did not play u o to standard. Unfortunately, Les Locke who had\nplayed in an international trial in Scotland the\nprevious e \u00abe ning did not strike^ torn and was a \"marked man\" by L.S.E. Hope springs eternal and perhaps next year\nI.C. will surmount the semi-final hoodoo- if only\nthey will put more \"guts\" into their football. Congratulations to Les Locke who has been capped\nfor Scotland against Ireland.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College Union, London. S.W.7.

    "content": "FELIX MtrUers U ike &di i**t City and OnCbto\n\u00ab_ _ \u00ab, 1 7 th f*1^n tir Sic According to your BditoriaJ in the last number of Felix,\nyou seem to share the view held by a numb eir of other people,\nthat I.C. should keep out of H.F.3. at all costs because of\nthe \"politics\" of the latter body.\nI fail to find in your art i ola any details whatever of\nthe alleged political affiliations of the N.U.S., although,\nby saying that \"The Union Officers have always felt it their\nduty .... to avoid connection with anything bearing a polit i es! tag\" you oe rta in ly imply that the N.U,S. has a definite\npolitical colour, although the possibility of this colour\nchanging abruptly is not ruled out either.\nTo support this view, you give precisely two instances\nof \"political activity by the N.U.S. The first is that, at\nthe outbreak of the last war, it advised all students: to\navoid! Military Servioe by becoming Pacifists. Pacifists\nare not members of any particular political party, as you\nprobably know. The second instance you quote is that the N.U.S. defied the Cold War by \"sending its officers to Mosoow\".\nApparently, by this you mean that it sent a delegation to\nMoscow. I think I am right in say in,\" that several bodies,\nincluding nearly all the polit io al parties of this country,\nfrom the Conservatives to the Communists, have also sent\ndelegations to Mosoow. Whatever can have prompted I.C. to\nleave N.U.S. because of this attempt at promoting international understanding Ioan not \"imagine.\nlorn mention the advantages of being a member of N.U.S. although, because of your fear of the \"polit io al\" bogy, I feel that you belittle these .advantages. The excuse that\nother travel bureaux also offer cheap tours and travel is a pitiful one. N. II.S. offers the chan oe to meet STUDENTS\nfrom other parts of the wor la. Xou consider that the Vacation Work Scheme is unnecessary because most of us do technical work in the summer vacation,anyhow. I would point\n3ut that jobs in the Christmas and Easter vac s, are also advertised and these are by no means in sign if ioan t. The\nonly other criticism you can make is that it \"appears to be\nbureaucratic\". I think this shoves how hard-Tjressed you\nare to find fault with the scheme.\nThe most important reason.why I.C. should join N.U.S. is that it is the only recognised representative body of\nstudents in the United Kingdom. In my view, this overrides\nall other considerations, as it means that this College can\nmake its voice heard, through official channels, in any matter af footing students as a whole. Take the question of\ngrants as one example. Our I.C. Union President could only\nattend are oen tN. U.S. conference on that subject as an observer, and although he expressed the opinion that the Conference fulfilled no useful purpose whatever, I feel that \"sour\ngrapes\" entered into that viewpoint.\nIf the R.S. M. Union wishes to remain outside N.U.S. if I.C. joins it, let them. After all, their job includes\nputting themselves ( and their heads ) into the ground.\nl ours faithfully,\nPrank Thilo\nI.C. Union.\nDear Sir, Our personal experience of N.U.S, has led us\nto reply to certain points in your editorial of Felix No. 87. We would like to draw attention to the\nfact that the N.U.S. constitution forbids discussion\nof political or religious questions not connected\nwith student affairs. In our own personal experience we several times\ndisagreed with certain aspects of N.U.S. policy, but\nwe were satisfied that by d is affiliation we would\ndo nothing to improve the policy of the National Union\nBy re affiliating I.C. Union could exert our considerable influence to ensure that through N.U.S. the real views of the students of this country are\nmade known. It is for this reason that we consider\nthe policy of N.U.S. at a particular time to be\nno valid reason for non affiliation. The true issue\nis that a strong national union is essential and the\nabsence of Imperial College is hampering its. effectiveness.\nYours sincerely, Henry C.Ell is Be.

Sj,\nthe other from Guilds, entered the library of the College of Estate Management. The\nother two occupants looked up and left the\nroom, leaving their cement owl undefended\non the mantel piece. It was promptly\ncarried out under a coat, long before the\nofficial party of twenty I.C. men could\narrive, complete with wedges to jam the\nswing doors and spare trousers for any\ncasualties sustained.\nThe, two students who took the owl\nwere members of the Dramatic Society\nwho have taken a great interest in other London Colleges this session.\nThey decorated the owl in appr opiate colours and crest to display at the\nnocturnal frivolities the following\nnight when the Royal School of Mines\nwere holding their Carnival \"Dreamland\"\nAmericans Debate with Imperial\nIf \"Love should always come before duty\"\nis a good debating motion, it almost certainly is even better when discussed on St. Valentine's day, and I.C. were even luckier in that they\nhad a chance to see and hear the two-man American\nUniversities debating team, at present touring\nUniversities and Colleges in this country.\nThe American pair, Joseph Trattner and Philip McCellan, opposed each other, Trattner beginning\nhis speech by doing an impression of a\" terri bi y> terribly, English voice, don't you know'' and\nproceeded to present to the Chairman (Les Alien)\n'as representative of the house' with an American\nflag, a bright red tartan golf cap (cheers as\n\u2022the Chairman put it on), a pair of multi coloured socks, ('ideal, for evening Wear') and last but by\nno means least a full length picture of La Monroe.\nThe cheers for this turned to cries of, disappointment\nchagrin or possibly frustration as Mr^ Trattoer\nrolled up the picture again and put it back into\nhis nag.\nHe and his opposite number? then settled down to talk and show just why they were picked\nfrom the many American1\nUniversities, both pleading\ntheir cause sincerely and at the same time\nliberally backing their speeches with anecdotes.\nThe second proposer, Raphael Berenbaum, showed\nas always that he was no mean speaker, and he too\nwas successful with such remarks as \"The other day\nI drove into an American car \u2014 had to drive out\nagain though, there wasn't enough room to park.\"\nHe achieved the neat balance of putting a case and\nat the same time being pleasantly amusing. Michael\nBe'rn stein seconded the opposition, proving on his way that even speakers of Sanskrit understood a Certain motto with reference to a dinghy, a ladder\nand a gent named Jacob.\nThere was only time for four short speeches\nfrom the floor. John Bingham's was the best, but\nMr. Webb and one other who pleaded for abstention\nhad their reward when the vote came, the motion being\ncarried by 110 votes to33 with no less than 35\nabstentions. It was an entertaining debate even if it was not a particularly stimulating one.\nTO CARNIVAL\nRAGGING ENSUES\nPress publicity reached the College\nof Estate Management telling them that\"\nI.C. had their owl long before most.\nImperial College students knew of its existance. ,\n_ \u2022\n\u2022\nThe Royal School of Mines was the\nfirst target of those hoping to regain\nthe owl, but the cooperation of the\nPresident, Secretary and Clerk of the\nUnion provided an adequate information'\nservice as to the marauders' where-about s. Chief of Staff Kitchener, \\\ntelephone in, each hand, sat in the\nUnion office directing operations.\nGroups of students accumulated inside\nthe entrance halls of various parts of\nthe College and routed the estate men.\nOne Guildsman who pursued them too\nfar went for a ride in one of their cars.He was redeemed for two of' their own men and two pairs of trousers, this reflecting the current market value of\ntechnicians.\nThe owl has since been displayed\nin various parts of the College. _ _ _ _ _ Imperial Win U.L.

The front\npage reports a debate, the first one in London\nin which the touring American debaters took i part. An account of the Touchstone weekend its\ngiven elsewhere at which the U.S. Cultural \u2022\nAttache was guest speaker. i The American people have a sense of humour.\nThey realise their position in the world today\nand expect to be taunted a little, especially by\nEuropeans, about their way of life.They even\nmake jokes about themselves, local ising the\nregion of boasters to Texas. This is hardly a reason for baiting our guests continuously, and\nthis did occur in a few instances recently.\nIf proper hospitality had been extended to' the visit ers by the Union, instead of leaving it to those with an axe to grind, our guests might\nnot have left Imperial College with the\nimpression that it was a hot bed of communist\nagitators.!? Plain (J~ ane thinks\nSince, because of\ntheir rowdy behaviour generally, men are not fit to\nOe in residence, the Hostel should be entirely inhabited by women. Strange men would then be welcome in strange places.\nContinuing in this\nvein, we might well ask\nwhy some of the males\nof this Institution of\nLearning manage to be\n8d nice whilst others\nare little better than\n1\nteddy-boys1.

Let us hope the new\nbar is ready by then as there is hardly room to eat a pancake in the present bar. Nevertheless the usual\nelbow-bending would appear to be drying up the supply\nfaster than ever: on Saturday night' the bar ran out of\nbrown and Worthington and at the extension upstairs\nthere was so little choice around ten o 'dock that I had\nto (try to) drink ginger beer. It was also unfortunate\nthat the Carnival bar was very nearly dry at one o 'clock\nand it was impossible, to get a drink without first finding a glass. As there were very few glasses in the hall\nit was obvious where most of them were and it was easy to\ndeduce where the drink had got to from the fact that a far smaller proportion of people than usual lasted the\nnight out in good form. Last year it was left to R.C.S. to show that a Carnival does not need to be a riot; let us hope that this year they can show that you do not have\nto be drunk to appreciate it. This year has seen the appearance of noticeable numbers of attractive secretaries on the college scene. It is generally accepted that Guilds leads in quantity \u00ab+\n,\nleast. Any offers for running a survey - or a competition?\nThe mountaineering community was very much in evidence\nat the Carnival following a dinner which many of them had\nattended. Ascents were made on the front of the Union\nand on the Albert Hall. Some men from C.E.M. thought :\n.\nthat the former climb was to hide some kind of owl. While\ntackling the Albert Hall they observed a young lady running away from the Carnival pursued by an agitated-looking\nfellow with a red beard.\nCongratulations to the men who painted Reggie a fortnight ago.\nAny form of attack on this, perhaps the most famous of college\nmascots, is always news, even in \"Sennet\". Reggie was acquired by a group of King's women some years ago when they\nsawed it off a pub in Chiswick, Perhaps Herbert could achieve such fame,, Ifw e could persuade the rest of the University that he came out of an egg laid by a member of I.C.?.A. Incidentally Herbert, who disappeared mysteriously last Maroh,\nis expected to re-appear shortly.\nA contingent of R.C.S. men made up a highly successful\ntheatre party to Chelsea Palace last Friday night to cheer\non Phyllis Dixie, who is still performing the same old antics.\nAll were sufficiently well oiled to approve highly of the show,'\nbut the' management, for some reason or other, appeared somewhat\nill at ease. .Afterwards, as a reward for livening up a certain\nChelsea coffee bar normally noted for being rather dull, seven\ncops, the Maria and a rather disinterested looking Alsatian\nhonoured the company with their presence.\nFrom the \"News of the World\"report an the court case\nfollowing the recent rag at Liverpool:\n\"Assaults occurred whe h students resisted arrest or\nwhen others,acting through misguided loyalty,went to the\naid of those being arrested.\"\nI.C. GOES MIDDLE EASTERN\nThe Israeli .evening organised by the International\nRelations Cltib and the Jewish Society begun et th a tourist\nfilm on Israel-They Met is Galilee. This film was good with\nits vivid contrasts of old and new. Then came an interesting\ntalk by Mr L. Savir, the Israel Embassy's Prase Attache.\nEveryone had been waiting for the free produce, and at\nthe interval there was a rush to the tables with requests-peanuts- more oranges- lets try that sherry- what about another glass. The liberal supply of nuts, fruit and wine was\nall gone in ten minutes.\nA group of young dancers pounded the floor of O^ia eni es accompanied by two hundred pairs of stamping feet, most of\nwhose owners were loudly singing to the music, and afterwards the display of Israeli handicrafts was carefully\nexamined.\nThis was one of the beet attended social meetings so\nfar this session.\nm. CS. MOTOR CLUB.\nAbout JO men turned up at a meeting in the R. CS. last\nFriday to di sous s the formation of a Motor Club. Derek Toms,\nin the chair , emphasised that the fire-engine was in need\nof ce re end ne in ten eno e and it sounded as tb cuf h. another big-end was em the way out. Furthermore, the three at j ree ent qualified to drive it would Be leaving at the end of the\nyear, so i two s necessary for more go learn.\nIt was decided to form a Motor CU_ with the primary\npurpose of looking after the fire-engine, but which would\nalso organise rallies, visits and other s twH sr create.
