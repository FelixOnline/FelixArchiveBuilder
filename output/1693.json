The\nCollege is also one of\nthe worst institutions for\nenergy consumption and\nwater waste.\nImperial was responsible for almost 75.8\nmillion kg of CO2\nreleased\nin 2016/17, data from\nthe Higher Education\nStatistics Agency (HESA)\nshows. This figure includes emissions from the\nCollege\u2019s direct fossil fuel\nuse (such as heating and\nthe shuttle bus service)\nin addition to the CO2\nreleased in the production\nof electricity, which the\nCollege then uses.\nImperial consumed\nnearly 236 million kWh of\nenergy, making it the third\nlargest consumer among\nUK universities. This\nis an improvement on\n2015/16 when Imperial\u2019s\nconsumption of almost\n260 million kWh topped\nthe list of worst offenders.\nIn its latest sustainability\nreport, the College claims\nits energy consumption\nin 2016/17 was \u201cparticularly high\u201d because of\nmaintenance work which\nleft the South Kensington\ncombined heat and power\nplant \u201cout of commission\u201d\nfrom August 2015 to February 2017. The system\nhas since been moved to\nthe \u201cmore energy efficient\u201d Slough.\nImperial\u2019s production\nof more than 60.5 million\nkg of waste also puts it\nin the bottom three. The\nmanners in which this\nwaste was disposed of\nare unknown but College\nfigures claim only healthcare waste \u2013 representing\n11% of Imperial\u2019s total\nwaste \u2013 is sent to landfill.\nbe much larger than the\namount of greenhouse\ngases it produces directly.\nImperial College\nUnion's Ethics and Environment Officer Rhidian\nThomas told Felix: \u201cThis\nis yet another disappointing performance from Imperial in terms of sustaina-bility, in a year that's seen\nplenty.

On the\nsurface of things, over the\npast few years things have\nonly been getting more\npositive for the two thirds\nof us who will experience\na mental health problem\nin our lifetime: we\u2019re now\nspeaking about mental\nhealth more than ever, and\nwhile there is certainly\nstill a stigma attached to\nmental illness, it\u2019s slowly\nbeing broken down.\nHowever, our main\narticle this week, on the\nImperial Counselling\nService, shows one of\nthe main problems with\nthe goal of this week:\nawareness is not action.\nAnd while it\u2019s brilliant\nfor people in power \u2013 pol-iticians, CEOs, College\nmanagement \u2013 to encourage us to speak openly\nabout mental health\nissues, it cannot replace\nreal-world resources for\nthose who are in need.\nI have been at Imperial\nsince 2012, and each year\nI hear horror stories about\nhow long the wait times\nare for the Counselling\nService. This month, we\ndecided to start looking\ninto the situation on the\nground, to see whether\nthese rumours had any\nfactual basis. Reports\nfrom the Counselling\nService showed where the\nroot of the problem lies:\nthe number of students\nwho need counselling is\nincreasing every year, but\nthe supply of counsellors\nis only being increased\nretrospectively, resulting\nin rising waiting times.\nThis, however, only\nshows us one aspect of\nthe problem. Over the\npast couple of weeks,\nwe\u2019ve spoken to a range\nof people in and around\nthe College, from students\nwho have accessed counselling in the past, through\nto student-facing staff\nmembers, senior man-agement, and the head of\ncounselling herself.\nWhat we found was a\nsituation that was complex\nand nuanced: student\nmental health is becoming\nmore of a problem for a\nwide variety of reasons,\nincluding both internal\nand external pressures;\nthis is having an increased\nburden on staff members\nwho want to support their\nstudents, and who are\nthemselves facing threats\nto their wellbeing; people\nacross the College are\ndoing great work, but in\nthe absence of a unified\nstrategy their efforts\nremain atomised.\nWe\u2019veputtogetherwhat\nwe learnt in this exclusive\nreport on mental health at\nImperial. Journalism will\nalways aim at a true representation of the world,\nbut on a topic as fuzzy and\nbroad as mental health,\nanything we produce will\nonly be able to cover\na small fraction of the\ntopic. I hope this serves\nas a catalyst for people\nat Imperial \u2013 not only to\nstart talking about mental\nhealth, but to actually do\nsomething about it.\nNobody we spoke to\nhad any bad words to say\nabout the Counselling\nService itself \u2013 I, and\nmany others, recognise\nthat they are a small team\nof dedicated staff, doing\nwhat they can with the\nresources available. But\nthis needs to change.\nAwareness, while it\nmight be welcome, does\nnot a functioning support\nservice make. Reminding\nus to look out for each\nother cannot make up for\na lack of student coun-sellors. Encouraging us\nto open up to one another\nis not a replacement for\nfunding. Mental health\ncannot be on the agenda\nfor one week out of the\nyear; it needs to be at the\nforefront of the College\u2019s\nthinking at all times.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWewantyou\u2013yes,you!We\u2019relookingforwriters,photographers,editors,illustrators,reporters,\ncomputer experts and grammar nerds to join our team.

While\nthe number of students\naccessing the counselling\nservice has increased by\nnearly 40% over the past\ntwo years, the service has\nhad no increase in funding\nsince 2016, meaning the\ncurrent counsellors are\nbeing stretched thin.\nEarlier this week, Oscar\nMurricane, Vice-Provost\n(Making Ends Meet),\nannounced contingency\nplans to help the service\ncontinue to provide counselling to students until\nthe College runs out of\nexcuses.

Alongside\nreasons like \u2018bereavement\u2019 and \u2018mental health\nproblems\u2019, students will\nnow be able to apply for\nmitigating circumstances\nbecause of: \u2018the ending of\nInfinity War being ruined\nfor me by some jackass\non Reddit who didn\u2019t use\nthe spoiler tag\u2019; \u2018extreme\nstress following having\nto explain who everyone\nin Infinity War is to an\nelderly relative\u2019; and \u2018too\nmuch time spent catching\nup on all the Marvel films\nI missed and not enough\ntime revising\u2019.\nThe move followed\nan increasing number\nof students approaching\nstudent services with\nInfinity War-related con-cerns. William Dablay,\nVice-Provost (Ambi-tious Crossovers), told\nHangman about some of\nthe rationale behind the\ndecision: \u201cJust following\nthe release of Infinity War\nwe had a number of students cite existential concerns over Thanos obtaining all infinity stones as a\nreason for potential poor\nperformance in upcoming\nexams. I presumed they\nwere all experiencing\nsome kind of break with\nreality, until my son\nexplained, at length, what\nthe film was about. Given\nthe sheer volume of Infinity War-related complaints,\nwe decided to alter our\npolicy mid-term.\nThe changes to the\npolicy have some notable\nomissions, however:\nNathaniel, a third year\nImperial student, was\nupset the policy made no\nmention of Black Panther.\n\u201cIf I fail my biomaterials\nexam, it\u2019s not going to be\nbecause of Spider Man or\nany of that bullshit,\u201d he\ntold Hangman, \u201cit\u2019s going\nto be because Wakanda\ndoesn\u2019t exist in real life.\u201d\n\u2018Siri, find me a picture of a Thanos\u2019// Marvel\nImperial to include Infinity War spoilers as mitigating\ncircumstances\nThis week you\u2019re excited\nthe weather has improved\nenough to break out your\nsummer short-shorts.

It was during\nthe revision period for\nmy January exams in 2nd\nyear, when I got the idea,\nwhich seemed so crazy at\nthe time, to just pack my\nbags and go to Paris after\nexams. The last exam was\non aThursday, and the new\nmodule was scheduled for\nthe following Monday,\nwhich left us with only\nthree days to relax and re-juvenate. But since Paris\nis so close to London and\nvisiting it had been my\ndream for a long time (and\nalso I was running out of\nways to procrastinate), I\nquickly organised transport and accommodation,\nconvinced a friend to\ncome with me, and finally\nwent on this spontaneous\nthree-day trip that ended\nup being one of the most\namazing things I\u2019ve\ndone during my time at\nImperial.\nDay 1\nOur trip started on\nThursday evening as we\ntook the overnight bus\nfrom London Victoria.\nThe journey took around\neight hours and was\naround \u00a315 one way (ob-viously, a train or plane\nwould have been quicker\nand more comfortable\nbut also much more\nexpensive). We crossed\nthe English Channel from\nDover to Calais on a ferry,\nwhere we had to get off\nthe coach and sleep on\none of the sofas inside.\nPro tip: you literally have\nto run to get yourself a\nsofa, else you might be\nstuck sleeping on a chair.\nUpon arrival to Calais,\neveryone was thoroughly\nchecked at the customs,\nespecially people from\noutside the EU. Needless\nto say, we didn\u2019t get much\nsleep that night, but hey, it\nmade the travel experience\neven more adventurous\nand unforgettable.\nWe arrived Paris at\n5am, way too early for\nour Airbnb check-in.\nWithout any data on our\nphones or a plan on how\nto travel around the city,\nwe wandered around until\nwe found an underground\nstation. Luckily, they\nhave maps all across the\nunderground system that\nclearly indicate where\neach landmark is. So the\nfirst thing we did at five\no\u2019clock in the morning\nwas visiting the Eiffel\nTower. Since it only opens\nat 9am, we first went for\nbreakfast at a cute French\ncaf\u00e9, where a lovely local\nlady gave us some sightseeing tips.\nWe came to the tower\njust in time for sunrise,\nwhich looked absolutely\namazing! The tower has a\nfew floors, with different\nticket prices \u2013 the very\ntop floor was closed so\nwe could only get student\ntickets for the middle\none. We spent some time\nadmiring the city from\nabove, did some souvenir\nshopping inside, and\nfound an ice rink on one\nof the floors. Never had I\never thought I would ice-skate above Paris!\nWe then continued our\njourney along Avenue\ndes Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, a\nlarge famous street full\nof shops and restaurants.\nWe had to stop at one of\nthe clothes shops to get\nsome warm gloves and\nsocks since the Parisian\nwinter was much colder\nthan that in London. Then,\nafter a \u2018lavish\u2019 lunch at\nMcDonalds (I usually opt\nfor super cheap food and\naccommodation whilst\ntravelling and spend more\nmoney on sightseeing\ninstead), we reached\nthe Arc de Triomphe.\nBut since we were still\ncarrying our heavy bags\nand tired after only four\nhours of sleep on the bus,\nwe headed straight to our\nAirbnb to drop off our\nstuff and have a nap.\nIn the evening, we\nvisited the Mus\u00e9e du\nLouvre (tickets are free\nfor people under 25) to\nsee the original Mona Lisa\nand other famous works\nof art. On our way home,\nwe caught a glimpse of\nthe beautifully lit up Eiffel\nTower in the distance.\nDay 2\nWe dedicated this day\nto Disneyland, located\noutside of the main city\narea but still accessible\nby direct trains. We got a\none-day two-park ticket\nfor around \u00a360 (mind you,\nthis was two years ago and\nwas also cheaper since\nwe went during off-peak\nseason), but only managed\ntovisitoneparksincethere\nare so many things to do.\nWe went to all of the kids\u2019\nrides and were the only\n20 year-olds standing in\nline (ain\u2019t even ashamed,\nI paid too much to skip\nall that). Adult attractions\nwere a bit more daring,\nlike the House of Horrors\nor high-speed roller\ncoasters, which altogether\nadded up to an amazing\nexperience. We concluded\nthe day by watching the\nfirework show above\nthe main Disney castle,\nthe last attraction of the\nday.

We climbed up the\nArc de Triomphe which\noverlooks the city, with\ntwelve streets projecting\naround the Arc in all\ndirections. We also visited\nthe Notre-Dame Cathedral and Montmartre to\ncomplete our Paris expe-rience. The only thing we\ndidn\u2019t have time for was\nthe Palace of Versailles,\ncontaining a museum and\ngardens, situated in the\nsuburbs of Paris.\nFinally, we took our bus\njourney back to London\n\u2013 having just arrived at\n8am, we were already\nsitting in the lecture\ntheatre that afternoon.\nHowever sleep-deprived\nI was, my happiness with\nthis trip was over the top\n\u2013 that\u2019s when I realised\nhow awesome travelling\nis, and it might be even\nmore fun when you get to\ndo that spontaneously.\n\u201cInside the\nEiffel Tower,\nwe spent some\ntime admiring\nthe city from\nabove and\nfound an ice\nrink on one\nof the floors.\nNever had I\never thought\nI would ice-skate above\nParis!\u201d\n\n"

But the next\ntwo \u2013 \u2018Dive\u2019 and \u2018Dark\nSpring\u2019\u2013 seemed like they\nsignalled a slight departure from the sound I have\ncome to know and love.\n\u2018Dive\u2019 seems to me to be\none of the most aggressive\nsounding Beach House\nsongs yet. Alex Scally\u2019s\nguitar has a surprising\nfuzz and an edge to it and\nthe final flourish kicks\nthe drum machine into\noverdrive. \u2018Dark Spring\u2019\ndid not make sense at first\neither. Their songs usually\ntend to envelop your soul,\nto attempt to slowly coax\nyou to resonate with their\nmelancholy.Their practice\nspace is entirely coated in\nwhite fur for fuck\u2019s sake,\nyou can\u2019t expect this band\nto force any feelings on\nyou. But that is how I felt\nabout what would turn out\nto be the album opener \u2013 it\nfelt forced.\nall of their songs sound\nthe same but their sound\nhere is much denser than\nin any of their previous\nwork. Listening to their\nolder songs I could always\nimagine my thoughts\nand feelings bouncing\nbetween the stratospheric\nsynths and the grounded\nrhythm of the drums, they\njust felt like they were a\nmile apart. This album\ndoes not let you do that.\nThere is much more going\non. There are more layers,\nthe production is cleaner.\nWhereas they previously made incremental\nchanges to their sound,\nhere they have taken a\nbigger step. The duo may\nhave taken a chance with\nthis change but it was not\nonly in sound where they\nchanged things up.\nMany question the\nrelevance of art, especially in today\u2019s world,\nwhere recycled political\nmessages permeate\neverything in order to\nassert the work\u2019s rele-vance. But art need not\nbe relevant in a way that\nmakes it obvious for\neveryone. It must protest,\nit must placate, and it\nmust be some sort of\nshining light for someone\nout there. It must simply\nbe true to life. And there\nis something about the\nextra pinch of darkness in\nthis album that sums up\nthe disillusionment that\nmany feel today without\nactually saying it.\nI don\u2019t want to just\nramble on about the\nabstract feelings I get\nwhile listening to the\nmusic. I have their words\nfrom the album to back\nit up. First of all, there\nseems to be a running\ntheme of the number\nseven in the story of this\nalbum. The first single\ncame out on 14/2, and\nthe total number of songs\nthe band have recorded\nwas brought to 77 after\nthe album\u2019s release. The\nsong \u2018L\u2019Inconnue\u2019 speaks\nof seven girls, and lastly,\nof course, the name of\nthe album. As seven is\nconsidered to be the queen\nof lucky numbers, at least\nin western culture, you\nwould expect there to be a\ntheme of the supernatural\nin the album. I feel it only\nserves to act as a contrast\nto the very real stories that\nVictoria\u2019s beautiful voice\ntells. Likewise, I perceive\nthe gloomy lyrics as a way\nto highlight the beautiful\nin their songs.\nThe contrast of \u201cStrawberries in springtime /\npretty, happy accidents\u201d\nand \u201cOn a hillside, I\nremember I am loving\nlosing life\u201d wants to\nground us. To remind us\nthat life has a bright side,\nthat we should not get\ncaught up in the bad, that\nevery melancholy must\nserve as a springboard for\nhappiness, and that this\nimagery to highlight the\nbright and beautiful, this\nbrilliant lyrical chiaroscuro is best encapsulated in\nthe lines: \u201cLittle girl, you\ncould be loved / Little\ngirl, you should be loved /\nThe moment you say you\nknow / Is the moment you\nare.\u201d\nOne of my friends\nmade a joke once that\nBeach House is driving\nmusic for the heavily\nsedated (if this were true,\nwe\u2019d probably see Tiger\nWoods endorsing them)\nand I feel that this album\nchanges that impression.\nIt probably went under the\nradar due to Tranquility b\nBase\u2019s release the same\nday. Beach House aren\u2019t\nabout that though. They\nkeep it on the DL.

Sh\u00f4!, let\u2019s get\nto the nitty-gritty.\nSh\u00f4! is a band from\nMarseille, on the southern\nsh\u00f4!re of France. From\nwhat I can tell, there\u2019s not\nmuch of a scene there;\nprobably just some venue\ncalled Le Jam or something (side note: I actually\nlooked it up, and there\nreally is a place called\nLe Jam in Marseille, and\nyes, it\u2019s a jazz bar). Either\nthe jazz revival is going\ninternational now, or\nthese guys were just some\noddballs that came out of\nnowhere. Either way, I\u2019m\nhappy the album landed\nin my hands. I\u2019m no\npush\u00f4!ver when it comes\nto music, but this left me\nsh\u00f4!ok, dazed and amazed\nlike a kid in a toysh\u00f4!p.\nThere are two threads\nthat run through the\nalbum, \u201cJust a Beginning\nPart x\u201d and \u201cSpatial Night\nPart x\u201d for x in 1, 2, 3 (last\nterm zonked me, friends).\nJaB is the start and the end\nof it, but it always shows\nup with its counterpart,\nisolating the two singleton\ncuts, \u201cCloud Drummer\u201d\nand \u201cSho!\u201d. The album is\ncohesive; the surprise cuts\ngive a rhythmic sh\u00f4!ve\nafter the spaced-out (uh),\nmellow \u201cspatial night\u201d\ncuts. JaB sh\u00f4!ws off more\nactive, driving melodies\n- some even sounding\nnearly math-rocky in their\ntone and construction, and\nproviding a nice counterpoint to the sh\u00f4!egaze.The\nsingletons build off both\nthese themes, displaying\ndifferent dimensions of\nthe band\u2019s burgeoning\ntechnicality.\nAnd the band have\nchops. While some\nmight jump ahead or fall\nbehind, nobody ever feels\nish\u00f4!lated from the jam.\nThere are some great\nchords laid down on\nCloud Drummer; \u201cSho!\u201d\nhas a wonderful shifting\ngr\u00f4!ove with a fantastic\ncross-section of layered\ninstrumentation - the\nmusicians duck in and out\nof phase with each other\nin a polyrhythmic jumble\nthat nearly respects a 4/4\npulse. And the sh\u00f4!cking\ntempo drop 3 minutes\nin kicks ass - the sloshy\nguitar reminds me of the\nlast Fleet Foxes album - at\nnear 5 minutes, it\u2019s slowly\nenveloped by a gorgeous\nkeyboard harmony slowly\nswelling up from the\nguitar\u2019s shadow; when the\nkeys dominate, the song is\nover.\nThe EP did feel a little\nsh\u00f4!rt. But for a first sh\u00f4!t\nat an album from the (ap-parently fresh) group, it\nwas remarkably cohesive\nand nicely technical;\noverall, a very enjoyable,\nvery promising piece\nof work. See you at the\nsh\u00f4!w!\n\u00d3lafur Arnalds at his absolute best\nW\nhat a\nwonderful\nevening at\nthe Royal\nAlbert Hall! \u00d3lafur\nArnalds, one of the most\nsuccessful artists signed\nby a minimalist record\nlabel\u2013ErasedTapes\u2013gave\na memorable performance\nto a sold out crowd at the\niconic London venue last\nMonday.\nThe concert was\nopened by Manu Delago,\nan Austrian Hang player.\nEphemeral sounds of three\nHangs, complemented by\nsome subtle electronics,\nresulted in a perfect\nopening act for what we\nwere about to experience.\n\u00d3lafur Arnalds brought\nwith him on this tour a\nstring quartet, a drummer,\nand two self-playing\npianos that play sequences of notes generated by\nan algorithm in response\nto the chords played by\nthe Icelandic musician\non another piano. The\nalgorithm also controlled\nsome of the lights on the\nstage. Pretty cool! The\nkey element in Arnalds\u2019\nmusic is his sparse piano\nplaying, with long notes\ncoming from strings and\ngentle electronics. This\ntime the sonic landscape\nwas extended by the\nsound cascades from\nself-playing pianos, and\ndrumming, which added\nnice dynamic to the show.\nThe concert was rather\nquiet and sometimes\nrequired the audience to\nstay absolutely silent and\nfocused to be able to hear\nbarely audible murmur\nelicited from the violin.\nThe atmosphere in the\nmajestic Victorian auditorium was very intimate.\nNot only was it due to\nbeautiful tunes played by\nbrilliant musicians, but\nalso Arnalds\u2019 charming\npersonality. The minimalist composer seemed to\nbe flabbergasted by the\nlegendary status of the\nplace and humbled by\nthe enthusiastic reception\nfrom the audience. Things\ngot emotional when he\ndedicated one song to the\ncouple in the crowd who\ngot engaged that evening.\nIt culminated at the end of\nthe concert, when, after\nthe first encore the band\nleft the stage, Arnalds,\nwith a trembling voice,\nthanked his family who\nflew over from Iceland\nto watch his performance\nand dedicated the very last\nsong to his late grandma.\nHe then sat behind one\nof the pianos and started\nplaying a very quiet\nand moving piece \u2018Lag\nFyrir \u00d6mmu\u2019. Halfway\nthrough, he was joined\nby the strings played by\nhis bandmates backstage.\nThe sound was kind\nof muffled, as if it was\ncoming from a different\nworld.\nThat was a magical way\nto end a great concert.\nI had tears in my eyes.\nNothing else could be\nplayed after that. Arnalds\nproved that evening\nthat he deserves all the\naccolades he receives.\nHe showed that he is a\nmature artist who is aware\nof every single sound\ncoming from the stage\n\u2013 or even from behind\nit \u2013 and is not afraid of\nexperimenting. We were\npresented with a lot of\nnew material on Monday\nand it made me truly\nexcited about the new\nalbum. The whole performance was probably the\nbest thing I have heard\nfrom him so far \u2013 it was\n\u00d3lafur Arnalds at his best.\nThat guy looks sh\u00f4cked.

Instead, they\nreturned home with the\nnews that their daughter\nhad leukaemia.\nKaiya, who was\ndiagnosed a little over\nsix weeks ago, is one of\nthe roughly 400 children\nwho are diagnosed with\nAcute Lymphoblastic\nLeukaemia (ALL) in\nthe UK each and every\nyear. Now, after several\nweeks of chemotherapy,\ninvasive procedures, and\ntesting, she is in desperate need of a stem cell\ntransplant. Unfortunately,\nher family hasn\u2019t been\nable to provide a match,\nand now are appealing to\nthe general public to help\nthem find one.\nALL is a form of blood\ncancer. While it can\naffect people of any age,\nit predominates in those\nbetween two and five\nyears of age, with three\nquarters of cases occuring\nin those under the age of\nsix.\nWhile the cause is\nunknown, there are a\nnumber of different\nfactors that can lead to\nthe development of ALL;\ngenetic factors are those\nmost closely associated\nwith the disease, and in\nKaiya\u2019s case a genetic\nabnormality has been\n\u201cBAME\npatients make\nup only 15%\nof the donor\nregister,\nmaking it\nharder to find\nmatches\u201d\n\u201cKing\u2019s\nCollege NHS\nHealth Centre\nare holding\na drop-in\nsession where\npeople can get\ntested\u201d\ndetected, with two chromosomes swapping part\nof their genetic informa-tion.\nEuropeans.

There is an exisiting\nonline community called\nWILDLABS.NET (found\nat the web address of\nthe same name).

It is now, more\nthan ever, that technology\nis needed if we are going\nto solve the most pressing\nconservation challenges\nof the modern age.\nThe community itself\nis run in association with\nUnited for Wildlife, a\ncharitable organisation\nthat is the collaborative\nefforts of multiple\nnon-governmental organisations such as WWF and\nZSL. The great thing is\nthat whether you are using\na new piece of kit that\nhas already been built, or\ndesigning your own from\nthe ground up, you should\nbe able to find a member\nof the online community\nwho is able to help! I have\nfirst-hand experience of\nthis: I designed a passive\nacoustic monitoring\nsystem for amphibians\nto use in Borneo. It had\na few teething issues,\nand I was not sure if the\ncomponents I tested the\nsystem with would stand\nup to the elements in the\nrainforest. Thankfully,\nmultiple members of the\ncommunity were able to\nhelp and, if it were not for\nthem, the project would\nprobably not have gone\nahead.\nIt is not just advice and\nguidance that the community provides, but also an\nopportunity to collaborate\nand network. Every scientist knows that the key to\nsuccess is a combination\nof these two things, and\nnetworking with people\nfrom all over the world\nwith the same technological problems or solutions\nis a great solution!\nThus, WILDLABS.NET\nprovides the conservation community with\na much-needed tool to\nfacilitate future partnerships between individuals and groups.\nTechnology is providing new options for conservationists // ConservationDrones.org\nInformation Conservation Technology\nScience at the gym: the molecular basis of metabolism\nE\nxercise is good\nfor you, we all\nknow that. You\ndon\u2019t need to\nread an article on it \u2013 or\ndo you?\nI guess the main\nquestion is, do you know\nhow to exercise effective-ly?\nThe standard answer\nabout the effects of exercising is that it trains\nheart muscles to become\nstronger, enabling it to\npumpeffectively,resulting\nin better blood pressure.\nHowever, these effects\nare on the macro-scale,\nand scientists have yet\nto identify the molecules\nthat bring about the health\nbenefits of exercising. In\nparticular, how exercise is\nable to elevate metabolic\nrate.\nSince metabolism is\nessentially the rate at\nwhich our bodies process\nchemicals, understanding\nthe molecular factors is\nimportant for us to combat\nmetabolic diseases and\nobesity.\nA recent paper demonstrated that a molecule\nnamed 12,13-dihy-droxy-9Z-octadecenoic\nacid (12,13-diHOME)\ncan influence metabolism.\nThis lipid molecule is\nreleased by the liver and\nfat tissues, and it belongs\nto a class of molecule\nscalled lipokines\u2013 \u2018lipo\u2019\nrefers to fat, and \u2018kine\u2019\ndenotes kinesis or\nmovement, suggesting\nthe molecule assists in the\nprocess of fat transport.\nPrevious studies have also\nreported that the lipokine\ncan improve skeletal\nmuscle insulin sensitivity,\ntherefore lowering ones\u2019\nrisk of diabetes.\nIn human studies,\nresearchers have found\nthat 12,13-diHOME\nlevels increased after\nexercise, compared to\n13 other lipid molecules\nthat were measured. This\nconfirmed the theory that\nthis lipokine is induced\nby exercise, with levels\nincreasing regardless of\ngender or age.\nNot only that, but they\nalso showed that 12,13-diHOME negatively\ncorrelated to fat mass and\nbody mass index (BMI).\nIn other words, you are\nlikely to have a higher\n12,13-diHOME level\nif you have a lower fat\ncontent, or a lower BMI.\nTo study the mechanism of 12,13-diHOME,\nscientists used mouse\nmodels to mimic the\neffect of chronic exercise.\nThey found that, indeed,\nthe lipid molecule in\nquestion increased after\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nexercise, and those mice\nthat were working out had\na lower fat mass as 12,13-diHOME can increase\nskeletal muscle fatty acid\nuptake.\nTo investigate the\nsource of 12,13-diHOME,\nthe scientists removed different types of fat tissue,\nand measured the level\nof 12,13-diHOME in the\nblood thereafter.\nThe results indicated\nthat mice that had their\nbrown fat removed do\nnot have an increased\nlipokine level, even after\nexercising in the same\nmanner. This experiment\ndemonstrated that 12,13-diHOME released from\nbrown fat is essential\nfor an exercise-induced\nincrease of the molecule\nitself.\nInterestingly, brown\nfat tissue is the type of\nfat that is responsible for\ngenerating heat when you\nare feeling cold. Funny\nenough, in another paper\nby the same research\ngroup, mice had an\nenhanced cold tolerance\nwhen they were exposed\nto a cold environment, or\nwhen 12,13-diHOME was\ninjected.\nIn the future, with sufficient understanding of the\nentire process, a synthetic\nform of 12,13-diHOME\ncould be developed as a\ndrug to treat metabolic\ndiseases and obesity.\nAt present, it is best to\nstick with your exercise\nroutine and eat healthy.\nAlternatively, perhaps,\nyou can be experimental\nand expose yourself to the\ncold and see if you lose\nweight faster!\nBe warned though,\nclearly, a larger human\ncohort is required to\nconfirm effects, and\nfurther studies are essential to understand the role\nof lipokines in metabo-lism. Enjoy your food and\nappreciate your body \u2013 as\nbeauty comes in all forms!\nTrainers hate it! Scientists identify new molecule implicated in exercise and weight loss!\nMmmm, feel that 12,13-diHOME! // CC\n\n"

Their quests are am-bitious, but it\u2019s dangerous\nto go alone.\nTheir Union has\ndevised Imperial Club\nExperience Project\n(ICXP) to equip clubs\nwith the tools they need\nfor development and to\nenhance their members\u2019\nexperience. By completing a set of goals, clubs\ncan gain the experience\nthey need to level up. Club\nthat opt in will be richly\nrewarded.\u2019\nAt this point anyone\nwith a penchant for 80\u2019s\narcade games should get\nthe (dubious) references,\nbut the real challenge is\nextracting meaning from\nsuch an abstract concept.\nICXP \u2013 what is it and\nhow does it affect clubs at\nImperial?\nICXP is a new reward\nand recognition scheme\nfor Clubs, Societies, and\nProjects (CSPs). The\nidea is that clubs can\ngain points for meeting a\nseries of goals related to\nthe management of their\ngroup. For example, by\nrunning a Give it a Go\nsession \u2013 essentially a\nfree or low cost taster or\nbeginner\u2019s class \u2013 a club\nwill gain five points.\nClubs can build points\nspread across five different themes to reach\na total score. Points are\nthen calculated to define\na clubs\u2019 overall \u2018level\u2019 and\nthe associated rewards.\nMany of the goals link\nto existing club activity,\nlike running an AGM or\nmeeting a minimum of\n20 members, while others\nrecognise clubs that are\nexpanding their activities,\nsuch as running large\nevents, trips, or tours.\nBenefits to clubs range\nfrom priority location\nat Freshers\u2019 Fair to\nexclusive development\nopportunities and grants.\nAs a minimum, clubs\nwill be afforded a unique\nbadge displayed on the\nUnion website A-Z; with\nnearly 17,000 hits during\nWelcome Week, virtually\nspeaking this is the place\nto stand out. Clubs will\nalso receive certification\nand consideration for the\nICXP Award at this year\u2019s\nUnion Awards on 15th\nJune. For those that need\nextra support, ICXP offers\nclubs 1-2-1 development\nplanning to help map their\nlong term growth, and\nlevel up to reach the juicer\nrewards in the future.\nYou may be thinking\n\u2018that\u2019s all fine and dandy,\nbut why now, and what\u2019s\nthe purpose?\u2019 With such a\ndiverse range of CSPs it\u2019s\na minefield for students\nto understand the ins and\nouts of all 370-something\nof them, and more impor-tantly, those which are\nwell run. From a member\nperspective, if I join a club\nwill it a) be good value\nfor money, b) provide a\ngood experience, and c)\neven be \u2018alive\u2019 still? ICXP\ngives students a way to\nnavigate the maze of clubs\nat Imperial, and sets apart\nthose focused on their\ndevelopment, and those\nsimply existing (looking\nat you Croquet)*.\nCSPs that join now will\nhave all points backdated\nto 1st\nAugust 2017 so\nthere\u2019s no excuse not\nto get involved and see\nwhere you stand in the\nleaderboard. In all truth,\nwe all just want to know\nwho wins the game of\nclubs\u2026\nReady player 2?\n*Now dormant, RIP.\nTo sign up your CSP\nbefore the deadline (21\nMay) go to imperialcol-legeunion.org/icxp.

The most\nrecent edition kicked\noff on Friday 20th\u00ad\nApril,\nfinishing on Sunday 22nd\u00ad\n.\nThe weekend got off\nto a good start, with\nLeague Captain Ben\nNevett conceiving of a\nnovel table-arrangement\nto maximise the hall\u2019s\ncapacity, blowing the\nminds of all present and\ncasting doubt on the necessity of years of turning\nplayers away from supposedly full tournaments.\nRound one opened\nto an entry list of 95 in\nthe Union Concert Hall.\nOrganisation was led by\nalumnus John Sargent,\nand play officiated by\nthe legendary FIDE International Arbiter Adam\nRaoof. Entrants were\nsplit into three sections\n(Minor, Major, and Open)\nbased on ability, with five\nrounds to separate them.\nThis edition saw the\nclub\u2019s President-elect\nFIDE Master Aron Teh,\nincumbent Thomas\nDonaldson, VP Francesco Salerno, and\nesteemed-member Aluna\nRizzoli brave the Open\nsection, with shock-en-trant superstar (formerly\nninth in the world\nrankings) and prolific\nauthor Grandmaster John\nNunn, raising the average\nrating of the section sub-stantially. International\nMaster Richard Bates and\ntwo-time Bangladeshi\nWoman\u2019s Champion\nAkter Shamima rounded\noff a remarkably strong\ntournament (much to the\nauthor\u2019s dismay).\nThe President started\noff well but saw his performance rapidly combust\nand crash in a microcosm\nof his academic career\nat Imperial, failing to\nconvert against WIM\nShamima and then losing\nto a welcome visitor from\nFrance, Jules Brunier.\nAron suffered a shock\ndefeat in round one,\nbefore storming into third\nplace with a streak of four\nruthless wins\u2014including\none over Aluna, who held\nonto two points out of five.\nRock-solid as ever, Francesco ended his time on the\ncommittee on a high with\ntwo wins, two draws, and\na single loss. First place\nwas shared by Dr Nunn\nand IM Bates, surprising\nno-one, after they paused\ntheir respective massacres\nof the opposition to agree\na quick draw in round\nfour.\nFor another incredibly\nsmooth weekend, we\u2019d\nlike to thank: Kristie\nThacker and the SAC\nteam for providing the\nvenue and access to the\nSAC kitchen; Adam\nRaoof for taking up the\nmantle of Chief Arbiter;\nJohn Sargent for returning\nas Chief Organiser again\nand doing everything that\ntitle entails.\nThis is IC Chess signing\nout for the year, we look\nforward to seeing you all\nagain in October!\n- Thomas Donaldson\nIC Chess showing off their new table arrangement // IC Chess\nIs your club ready? // ICU\n\n"

Each\nyear works by amateur\nartists, those still looking\nfor their big break, are\nexhibited alongside the\nwork of the established\nAcademicians: artists\nelected to the Royal\nCollege of Art (much like\nscientists are elected to\nthe Royal Society). It is an\nexhibition like no other,\nwith visitors guaranteed\nto see work by artists that\nthey would have never\nheard of otherwise.\nThis laudable support\nof emerging artists has\nbeen historically absent\nfrom the rest of the RA\ncalendar. This is because,\ndespite being one of the\nmost prestigious postgraduate art schools in\nthe country, beyond the\nannual RA Schools Show,\nthe Academy has rarely\nallowed the public to be\nprivy to the contemporary\nart being shaped within its\nwalls. As a result, outside\nof the blockbuster shows,\nthe RA struggled to draw\nin visitors.\nAll this is about to\nchange. From next week,\n250 years since the Royal\nAcademy was created,\nthe New RA is set to be\nunveiled.\nFor the first time, two\nRA buildings in the heart\nof Piccadilly \u2013 one in\nBurlington House, and\nthe other in Burlington\nGardens \u2013 will be joined\ninto a unified campus in\nwhich the public are free to\nwander. The merging has\nbeen designed by architect\nSir David Chipperfield,\nwho, rather than overhauling the historic buildings,\nhas staged \u201cdiagnostic,\npunctual interventions\u201d: a\nconcrete link bridge here,\na space-transforming\nskylight there, to create\na whole that is fiercely\nmodernist and respectful\nof its considerable history.\nThe expansion will put\nthe Academy\u2019s collection\non display for free to the\npublic for the first time.\nVisitors will be able to\nsee works that include\nMichelangelo\u2019s Taddei\nTondo, the only marble\nsculpture by the sculptor\nin Great Britain.

Normally based at\nJoe\u2019s Pub, an affiliate\nof New York\u2019s Public\nTheatre, Scott came to\nLondon earlier this year\nto perform Thirsty at the\nVault Festival.\nThirsty is an hour-long\ncabaret performance\ndetailing exploits from\nScott\u2019s life: from her\nteenage discovery of\nvodka and their subsequent lifelong love-story,\nthat one time she ended\nup in prison, and the\ntrials and tribulations of\neveryday New York life,\nshe\u2019s ready to share it all\nin this comic confessional.\nIt\u2019s all powered through\nwith classic songs from\nold musicals and subverted takes on modern\nhits. Scott\u2019s escapades are\nfunny to be sure, but what\nreally brings it all together\nare her powerful vocals\nand natural self-deprecat-ing humour.\nA running thread\nthroughout her interactions with the audience are\nher references to America\nand its political situation.\nWhilst we\u2019re all probably\ntired of the go-to references that make easy fodder\nfor comedians, Scott\nbrings a uniquely funny\ntake to it by drawing parallels to her own drunken\nmisadventures. America\nis that good friend who\nhas had one too many and\nlost control. It makes big\nissues shallow, but this\nsort of thing is in keeping\nwith the atmosphere of\nScott\u2019s storytelling.\nIt\u2019s not just the jokes\nand funny stories that\nstand out in this perfor-mance, though. Scott is a\ntruly talented singer and\nyou can\u2019t deny the power\nof her vocals. There are\ntoo many great numbers\nto name them all, but\nher rendition of Hozier\u2019s\n\u2018Take Me to Church\u2019 and\nJanelle Mona\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Tightrope\u2019are amongst the best.\nHer performance really\ncomes to a head in its final\nmoments with an amazing\nversion of the criminally\nunder-performed \u2018Wig\nin a Box\u2019 from rock\nmusical Hedwig and the\nAngry Inch, followed by\n4 Non Blondes\u2019 classic\n\u2018Whats Up\u2019. Ending on\nthose two stellar per-formances, there is no\nway the audience could\ndo anything but demand\nan encore. It wasn\u2019t just\nScott who\u2019s amazing: she\nis backed up by a three-piece band \u2018The Shame\nSpirals\u2019, consisting of\nmusical director/ pianist\nAdam Wachter, drummer\nLisa Martin, and bassist\nJamie Wilkins. They are\nthe perfect foils for each\nother, and together they\ncreate a brilliant show.\nThe Vault Festival\nis the perfect place for\nScott, although the particular stage used, \u2018The\nCrescent\u2019, isn\u2019t an ideal\nchoice. Its standard stage\nlayout with the audience\nin rows facing the performer seems too conventional for Thirsty which\nmight have felt more at\nARTS\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nARTS\nVaishnavi\nGnananthan\nArts Writer\nA visualisation of the RA link bridge // David Chipperfield Architects\nhome taking over one of\nthe Vaults\u2019 large bars.

The only\nsound you can\nhear is the rhapsodic music of your game.\nSleep is trying to lure you\ninto its pull. You try to\nresist its charms. You have\nlectures in the morning.\nYou know the smart thing\nto do is to shut down the\ngame, and go to sleep. But\nyou can\u2019t bring yourself to\ndo it. Just one more level\nup, one more turn and it\u2019ll\nall be over.\nThis is a scenario a lot\nof gamers are familiar\nwith. We all give ourselves a limit, we all say\nwe\u2019re not going to cross\nit, but before we know it,\nwe\u2019ve already gamed our\nnight away and are feeling\nsomewhat miserable, or\nat the very least, utterly\nexhausted when it\u2019s over.\nUnless of course, you\u2019ve\nbeen downing Mountain\nDew like a madman. I\u2019ll\nkeep going until I hit the\nnext level, you think.\nWhy do we do that?\nDo we really get any\nadvantage over doing\nsomething there and then\nas opposed to doing it\nlater, after we\u2019ve done\nmore important things?\nNo we don\u2019t; it\u2019s the\ngame, or maybe yourself,\nfooling you into thinking\nyou need to keep going,\nfor some kind of artificial\nendpoint. You may feel\nlike you have something\nto complete before you\ncan stop, but you really\ndon\u2019t.\nAs an example of this,\nimagine you\u2019re reading\na book. You\u2019re about to\nclose the book and go to\nsleep only to realise you\nhave eight or so pages left.\nYou decide to forgo sleep\nforthemomentandplough\non. It\u2019s understandable\nwhy someone would do\nthis; you\u2019ve just invested\neleven or so hours into\nreading the book, and you\nthink another half an hour\nwon\u2019t make a difference.\nBut remember, at this\npoint, you\u2019re already half\nasleep, and the ending\nwon\u2019t have the same\namount of impact on you\nnow as compared to when\nyou\u2019re wide awake.\ncall it quits while you\u2019re\nstill ahead. But then you\nfind out you\u2019re only a\nfew more achievements\naway from levelling up.\nSo you decide to slog\nyourself through it and\nget the achievement. But\nonce you do, you don\u2019t\nreally feel any better for\nit. In fact, you might look\nat your current gaming\ntime a little less fondly\nthan before. Why is this?\nSimply put, you stopped\nplaying for the fun of it.\nYou were now playing to\ncomplete a task. Worst\nstill, it was a task with no\nreal benefit, at least not\nin the real world at that\nmoment. It was a task you\ndecided to put on yourself.\nPeople, in general, love\ncompleting things: it\u2019s\nhuman nature. Whenever\nyou decide to finish\nplaying a game, you\ndo so out of your own\nvolition, after you\u2019ve hit\nsome sort of goal. Game\ndesigners make sure\nto add in some kind of\nmarkers or indicators that\nmake us feel some kind of\nprogress or completion.\nThese can take the form of\ncheckpoints, rewards after\ncompleting challenges or\nfinishing a level.\nFor the most parts,\nthese types of endpoints\naren\u2019t bad. They give a\nsense of game advance-ment, or, in the case of\ncertain achievements,\nencourage you to play in\na different and interesting\nway. The real issue is with\nmeaningless endpoints,\nwhich players create for\nthemselves. Civilisation\nis the biggest game where\nplayers create hollow\nendpoints for themselves.\n\u2018Finishing\u2019 a game of Civ,\ninvolves several hours\nat the fastest and several\nweeks at the slowest. You\njust cannot finish a game\nof Civ in a short timespan,\nso you settle for stopping\nat the next turn, which\nleads to the next turn and\nso on. And thus, people\nfind themselves unable to\nlet go or stop a game.\nFree-to-play games,\nespecially, mobile games\nin particular, are usually\ndesigned in a way to give\nyou some arbitrary end-points. They usually have\nseveral types of progression bars or achievements\nlist to show you how much\nyou\u2019ve been playing and\nhow much you serve to\ngain by playing further.\n\u201cGain\u201d is a bit of a loose\nterm, it\u2019s really the game\nconfusing your brain into\nthinking there are things\nto be gained.\nHopefully, now that\nI\u2019ve spelt things out a\nbit, it\u2019ll be become easier\nto drop games at the first\nopportunity. Recognise\nwhy you\u2019ve been playing\nup until a certain point\nand whether you\u2019re doing\nit to meet some kind of\nartificial endpoint. If you\ncan learn to let go at the\nright time, you\u2019ll be all\nthe better for it and enjoy\nthe game much more as a\nwhole.\nMore often than not, we keep on playing a game even though we know we should\u2019ve stopped a while ago. What\nexactly is the reason behind this?\nThat infamous\u2018one more turn\u2019. Who needs sleep when you can build an empire! // 2K Games\nIn a more gaming\nrelated example, imagine\nyou\u2019ve been playing a few\ngames of Dota. You\u2019ve\nbeen doing really well\nand feel like it\u2019s time to\n\u201cThe real\nissue is with\nmeaningless\nendpoints,\nwhich players\ncreate for\nthemselves\u201d\n\n"

The increased\nawareness of mental\nhealth has been reflected\nin his training, but he\nreports reductions in\noverall support for war-dening teams: \u201cThere may\nhave been more resources\nput into the whole support\nnetwork across College,\n[but] wardening is possibly the exception, where\nwe\u2019ve seen a reduction in\nnumbers.\u201d\n\u00a7\nIt is important to highlight these problems with\nmental health are by no\nmeans unique to Imperial.\nRather, it is a problem presenting across the board\nat universities and within\nthis age group. Professor\nBuitendijk told Felix the\n\u201cconcerns about waiting\ntimes for the student\ncounselling service,\nwhich have increased due\nto rising demand\u2026are a\nchallenge faced by all UK\nuniversities.\u201d\nIn the past five years,\nthe vast majority of\nuniversities have experienced a sharp increase in\nstudents seeking support,\nwith nearly 90,000 students requesting counselling services in the UK in\n2015/16. The number of\nstudents dropping out of\nuniversity due to mental\nhealth problems has also\ntrebled in recent years,\nwith Norman Lamb,\nformer Health Minister,\ndescribing the situation as\na \u201ccrisis on campus.\u201d\nIt is a problem noted at\na national level: Universities UK last week released\na report on mental health\nin higher education,\nwhich revealed nearly\n60,000 students disclosed\na mental health condition\nto their university this\nyear, compared with under\n10,000 ten years ago.\nproblems in the last five\nto ten years, the academic\nenvironment at Imperial\nwas a contributing factor.\n\u201cI think the academic\nenvironment is a strong\npart of perpetuating\nissues people had before,\u201d\nMartyn tells me, \u201cbecause\nof this environment students perceive we have \u2013\nand I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true,\nI think students conform\nto it \u2013 they put silly\npressure on themselves.\nIf you have mental health\nissues, or a predisposition\nto them, the chances are\nyou\u2019re going to accelerate\nthat process by putting\nall this extra pressure on\nyourself.\u201d\nHe tells me a story\nabout changes made to the\nfirst year labs within the\nDepartment of Materials:\na few years ago, students\nwould have around a week\nto complete a comprehensive lab report, whereas\nnow they submit a much\nshorter piece of work the\nnext day. The submission\nis electronic, so tutors can\nmonitor how many people\nare turning it in at what\ntimes: the results showed\npeople handing in work\nthroughout the night, up\nuntil 7am. He asked his\nstudents to raise their hand\nif they\u2019d spent more than\nan hour on it, two hours,\nthree hours\u2026 by the time\nhe reached the eight hour\nmark most of the class still\nhad their hands up. The\nindividual reports contributed around 0.01% to\ntheir degree, but \u201cbecause\nthere are marks associated\nwith it, they put so much\ntime and effort into it,\ndisproportionate to the\nmagnitude of the task\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a story that calls\nto mind the institutional\nculture review carried\nout at Imperial, in which\nthe words \u2018competitive\u2019,\n\u2018ambitious\u2019, and \u2018driven\u2019\nwere among the most fre-quently-cited descriptors\nof the College. The report\nsuggested there was a\nlack of community spirit\nwithin the university,\npartly due to a lack of\ncommunal space, and that\nthe \u201ccompetitive, individualistic pursuit of research\nexcellence often comes\nat the expense of other\nvalues.\u201d Students and\nstaff, the report argues,\n\u201cfelt that there was an\nall-consuming focus on\nacademic performance,\nand negative attitudes\ntowards those who did not\ndo well or who were not\nas driven as others.\u201d\nfrom speaking to friends\nthat so many people are\nreally struggling\u2026unless\nyou tackle this culture,\nalmost independent of\nhow good the services are,\nnobody is going to seek\nthem out.\u201d\n\u201cIf I wanted to send\nout one message, it\nwould be that asking for\nhelp is not weak.\u201d Helen\nMoney-Kyrle, the Royal\nSchool of Mines Union\u2019s\n(RSMU) Welfare Officer\ntells me, \u201cit shows that we\ncan be open to change, and\nit allows us to improve.\u201d\nThis inability to seek out\nhelp has been identified\nby many at Imperial as a\nmajor stumbling block for\nstudent support.\nAt the end of my conversation with Martyn,\nhe takes me down the\ncorridor from his office\nto show me the Materials\nCommon Room \u2013 a lecture\ntheatre the department\nconverted into a shared\nspace, and given back to\nstudents. The handful of\nstudents present \u2013 sitting\nat sofas, gathered around\ntables looking at laptops\n\u2013 sit up to attention when\nMartyn enters, but quickly\nrelax back into their usual\nroutine. \u201cIt has caused us\nissues with timetabling\nand with management,\u201d\nMartyn says, \u201cbut I think\nthe benefits are good.\u201d\nThe space, which encourages students from\ndifferent years to spend\ntime together, forming\ninter-year groups, is\nsomething of which he is\nclearly very proud. \u201cTo\nsay \u2018I found that difficult\u2019\nor \u2018I wasn\u2019t prepared for\nthat\u2019 is seen as a sign of\nweakness\u2026having other\npeople say they went\nthrough the same thing [at\nthat stage of their degree]\nmakes you think you\u2019re\nnot alone, which I think is\nhugely beneficial.\u201d\n\u00a7\nAt the end of my\nconversation with Rosie,\nafter we have discussed\nthe need the Counselling\nService has for more re-sources, I ask her one last\nquestion: how does she\nfeel about the future?\n\u201cI will be a lot more\npositive if I hear we\u2019ve\ngot the additional resourc-es, and space to put that\nadditional resource in.\nThat we\u2019ve got a waiting\nroom, and there are plans\nto look at mental health\nacross Imperial in a joined\nup, integrated way. Then I\nwill be very positive.\u201d\nNames have been\nchanged.\n\u201cStudents\nsaid an echo-chamber of\nmyths drove\ncompetition\u201d\nThe UUK report also\nhighlighted the number of\nsuicides among students,\nwhich they say have been\nincreasing steadily since\n2013. In the run-up to this\narticle I received emails\nfrom a number of staff\nwho have been informed\nthat three Imperial undergraduates have taken their\nown lives this academic\nyear \u2013 significantly higher\nthan would be expected\nfor the age group or\ngeographical area. The\nCollege told Felix their\nrecords showed only one\nstudent who had taken\ntheir own life since 2016,\nas judged by a coroner as\npart of an official inquiry.\nThey are not able to\nspeculate on past student\ndeaths, or ongoing inquir-ies.\nWhy has there been\nthis increase in mental\nhealth problems? Martyn\nbelieves there has been a\nchange in what it is like to\nbe a young person, and \u201cat\nthe point of entry students\nseemtocomeinwithmuch\nmore baggage than they\ndid historically\u201d, while\nothers identify increased\nacademic, financial, and\nsocial pressures.\nWhile most people\nI spoke to felt Imperial\nhad become a lot better at\nrecognising mental health\n\"To say 'I found that difficult' is seen as weakness\"\nCont. from page 5\nStudents reported a sense of pressure among their cohorts // Imperial\nWhere to get help, on and off campus\nIf you're having problems, you shouldn't suffer in silence.

After waiting a\nfew weeks for an initial\nassessment, she went\nalong to the counsellor's\noffice at her appointed\ntime, ready to talk to\nsomeone about why\nshe needed help. The\nproblem she had come\nin with, however, turned\nout to be the tip of the\niceberg: as the counsellor asked her questions,\nfurther issues were\nidentified, which Claire\n\u2013 consciously or unconsciously \u2013 had pushed\nto the back of her mind.\nShe then waited another\nten weeks before accessing regular counselling\nsessions.\n\u201cI was disappointed,\u201d\nClaire tells me, \u201cThat\nappointment made me\nfeel worse, because I had\nto talk about my past and\nother deep stuff \u2013 there\nwere all these problems I\nneeded to work through,\nand then I was told to wait\nfor two months.

The number\naccessing counselling\nhas been increasing\nevery year, up from 552\nhalf a decade ago. The\nCounselling Service is\nlocated in a nondescript\ncorner of the third floor of\nSherfield Building, above\nthe hustle and bustle of\nthe main walkway; along\na quiet corridor, a series\nof wooden doors lead into\nrooms where a small team\nhelp students who are in\nneed. These calm sur-roundings, however, belie\na service that is coming\nunder increasing pressure\neach year, as more students seek out support.\nThe Counselling\nService is run by Rosie\nSummerhayes, a chartered\ncounselling psychologist\nwho first joined Imperial\nin 2003. Prior to that, she\nhad experience within the\nNHS and another higher\neducation institution.\nRosie is the kind of person\nyou probably imagine\nwhen you think of the\nword \u2018counsellor\u2019: relaxed\nand softly-spoken, with\na voice that is both calm\nand calming, she answers\nmy questions about the\nstate of the service with a\nquiet precision.\nThe service is divided\ninto two branches: the\nStudent Counselling\nService, and the Student\nMental Health Advice\nService. Counselling can\nbe made available for\nany registered student,\nwho will have an initial\nmeeting with a counsellor\nto determine what they\nneed. Following on from\nthis, the student will,\nif deemed appropriate,\nreceive counselling.

For the first eight\nminutes, Jeff Humphrey,\nthe interviewer, speaks to\nRachel Dolezal, president\nof the local NAACP chap-ter, about hate crimes she\u2019s\nexperienced living as a\nblack woman in the USA.\nIn the last 30 seconds,\nhowever, he goes for the\njugular, asking her: \u201care\nyou African-American?\u201d\nShe walks away.\nDolezal, the chair of the\nOffice of the Police Ombudsman Commission and\nan instructor in Africana\nstudies at Eastern Washington University, is not\nAfrican-American. She\nwas born in Montana,\nto white parents, and, at\nsome point after leaving\nher parents\u2019 house for uni-versity, began presenting\nas an African-American\nwoman. The revelation\nover her identity birthed\na short-lived cycle of\nthink-pieces and online\ncommentary, before\nher image was simply\nrecycled into a series of\nmemes, which still crop\nup from time to time,\nwith Dolezal becoming a\nby-word for the inauthen-tic appropriation of black\nculture and suffering by\nwhite individuals.\nFor Asad Haider,\na founding editor of\nViewpoint Magazine,\na publication centred\naround Marxist theory\nand analysis, Dolezal\u2019s\nstory is emblematic of a\nmuch wider issue within\ncontemporary political\ndiscourse: the problems\ncontained within identity\npolitics. Dolezal exercised\nher \u201csovereign right as an\nindividual working within\nthe framework of identity\u201d\nwhen forming her public\npersona, and \u2013 if we are\nto look at why her case\nmakes us uncomfortable\n\u2013 we need to analyse what\nwe mean by identity.\nMistaken Identity:\nRace and Class in the Age\nof Trump attempts to do\njust that, neatly dissecting\nthe current issues with\nidentity politics, and\nlooking to a black radical\ntradition to see how the\nleft can move forward\nin the future. In a series\nof short chapters, Haider\ntakes us through the formation of identity politics,\nthe current problems it\nthrows up for organisation\nand solidarity, and how it\ncame to develop in this\nway.\nHaider writes from\npersonal experience: he\ndescribes his difficult relationship with the terrain of\nidentity, with a childhood\nthat left him \u201cconvinced\nof the impossibility of\nsettling on fixed territory\u201d.\nBorn in Pennsylvania, he\nwould spend every other\nsummer visiting relatives\nin Karachi \u2013 split between\nthese two experiences of\nthe world, he settles on\na world-view that does\nnot fit into the American\nparadigm, left without\n\u201canything resembling an\nidentity\u201d. This confusion\nintensifies following the\nevents of 9/11, which saw\na \u201cculture of condescending and exclusionary\nreactionism\u201d mutate into\nan \u201cundercurrent of open\nhostility\u201d.\nHaider is at his best\nwhen neatly skewering\nthe most unproductive\naspects of today\u2019s discussions around identity.\nHe takes umbrage with\nhow theoretical ballast\nunderpinning sociological\nand political concepts\nhas been eroded over\ntime \u2013 intersectionality,\nfor instance, which\nlegal scholar Kimberle\nCrenshaw based in materialistic reality, \u201cnow has\nan intellectual function\ncomparable to \u2018abracadabra\u2019 or \u2018dialectics\u2019\u201d.\nThose who read the\nsubtitle of the book and\nexpect an analysis of how\nrace or class really operate\nunder Trump, however,\nwill be disappointed.\nHaider very rarely touches\non Trump, or the reason\nhe managed to take the\nWhite House, and only\nmentions Hillary Clinton\nas an example of where\nidentity politics becomes\ndisconnected from a fully\nrealised revolutionary\nagenda \u2013 a politics wholly\nconstituted by the idea\nof identity, rather than\nformed through it.\nAny discussion about\npolitical concepts needs\nto examine their founda-tions: you cannot have a\ndebate about the current\nrefugee crisis without\nasking what we mean by\nstatehood or borders, and\nidentity politics should not\nbe mobilised without an\ninterrogation of what we\nmean by identity. Haider\nis aware this can be tricky,\nsince, in the absence of\n\u201cother practical organisational efforts to combat\nracism, any questioning of\nthe framework of identity\nseems like an attempt to\ndeny the validity of the\nantiracist struggle.\u201d\nHaider compares\nidentity politics to religious fundamentalism,\nsaying \u201csome choose the\nconsolations of funda-mentalism. But others\nchoose the consolation of\nidentity\u201d. But he doesn\u2019t\nseem to go far enough in\nidentifying what these\nconsolations are. He\ntracks the emergence of\nidentity politics in its\ncurrent manifestation as a\nresult of both a black elite\nprioritising racial unity as\na means of preventing solidarity among the working\nclass, and a neoliberal\nagenda that divorced progressive language from its\ngrassroots base, leaving\nit hollow. This is all well\nand good, but the popularity of identity politics\nwithin online discourse\nmust have more to it.\nUltimately, what\nfrustrates Haider about\nidentity politics seems to\nbe how it has become a\nsubstitute for real-world\norganisation and action.\nActivists have \u201callowed\npolitics to be reduced\nto the policing of our\nlanguage\u201d while \u201cthe\ninstitutional structures\nof racial and economic\noppression persisted.\u201d\nThe turn away from a revolutionary nationalism,\nwhich Haider identifies\nin the work of mid-cen-tury black radicals, has\nallowed the capitalist\nstate to absorb their\nchallenges. To fight back\nagainst Trump, we need\nto \u201cprovide alternative\nvisions, languages, and\npractices\u201d. Unfortunately,\nwhile this book is a good\nstart to the conversation,\nHaider is unable to offer\nus a practical vision of\nwhat this new reality\nmight be.\nRachel Dolezal sparked a debate about identity // Wikimedia\nBOOKS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nVerso. 144 pp.\nMISTAKEN IDENTITY\nby Asad Haider\nJesse Jackson put forward his\u2018Rainbow Coalition\u2019in the\n1980s // Wikimedia\n\n"

The most\nprevalent instrument is\nthe keyboard, contrasting\nthe guitar-laden approach\nthey had taken thus far.\nIt\u2019s stripped back; across\nmost tracks only simple\nmelodies accompany\nTurners vocals, which\nhave also undergone\nan upheaval, almost\nsounding like spoken\nword. Largely discarded\nalso are single-ready\ncrowd pleasers with memorable chorus\u2019 and riffs;\ninstead they have made a\nconcept album.\n\u201cHouston, Tranquillity\nBase here. The Eagle\nhas landed.\u201d Neil Armstrong declared during\nthe 1969 moon landing,\nwhich would be the site\nwhere humans walked\non a different celestial\nbody for the first time.\nThe album\u2019s concept is a\nvery literal translation of\nthis, setting up a resort\nupon the moon with\nTurner playing a character\nlooking introspectively\nat humanity and himself.\nIndeed, the opening lyric,\n\u201cI just wanted to be one\nof The Strokes / now look\nat the mess you\u2019ve made\nme make\u201d, shows how far\nfrom their roots they have\ntravelled, a world away\nfrom playing to small\ncrowds in Sheffield bars.\nAnd this is one of the\nissues that many fans are\ndivided over. These cocky,\nfunny, and unabashedly\narrogant young men\nstarted out uncaring of\nsuccess, shunning awards\nshows, and looking down\nupon crowd-pleasing\nartists. Eight years on\nfrom their debut, the\nrelease of AM showed\ngrown rock stars, a completely different front to\nthe one they portrayed in\ntheir earliest days, leading\nto shouts from some fans\nthat they had sold-out.\nAnd now with the new\nrecord, we have a new\nface again; relatable in its\nloneliness and vulnerabil-ity, but more remote than\never.\nIt would be na\u00efve to\nthem to still be singing\nabout slipping past the\nbouncer into a club.\nListening to their debut\nthough, it is hard to\nbelieve that they would\nhave turned to social commentary and politics for\nnew musical inspiration.\nBut here we are. In nearly\nevery song, Turner sings\nabout his mistrust of the\nrapid usurpation of technology and social media.\nHis character sits in\ntheir lunar hotel, looking\nat humanity viewing\neach other through their\nscreens, as it changes how\nwe interact and emote,\nbefore ironically turning\nto the internet himself to\nhelp answer his questions:\n\u201cI want an interesting\nsynonym to describe this\nthing / that you say we are\nall grandfathered in / I\u2019ll\nuse the search engine\u201d.\nIn 2005, Alex Turner\nwas taking a \u201cTopshop\nprincess\u201d home, now he is\nstaring at his \u2018Batphone\u2019,\nwaiting for it to light up\nwith a message from the\none he is falling for.\n\u2018Golden Trunks\u2019 delves\ninto the political world;\nit includes the quite fantastic lyric \u201cthe leader of\nthe free world / reminds\nyou of a wrestler wearing\ntight golden trunks / He\u2019s\ngot himself a theme tune\n/ they play it for him\nas he makes his way to\nthe ring\u201d. In a sense this\nechoes their previous\nstyle, comedic and witty,\nbut more poncey - this\nnew flowery cynicism is\nshown again in \u2018American\nSports\u2019. Turner bemoans\npoliticians \u201ctaking the\ntruth and making it fluid\u201da round-about way of\nsaying \u2018fake news\u2019.\ndoes it become too much?\nThis new prose-like\nstyle contains so many\nreferences to famous\nworks and some lines\nare so pompous it makes\nyou wonder if he had a\nthesaurus beside him as\nhe wrote. It is an issue he\naddresses throughout the\nalbum, that it may \u201cend\nup too clever for its own\ngood\u201d. And despite the\nflooring arrogance, it\u2019s\ndifficult to disagree.\nUndoubtedly, the\nhardest thing to swallow\nabout the album is its lack\nof instrumental prowess.\nThis bare sound is not\nwhat they are known for,\nand this latest venture\nfeels as though the rest of\nthe band have been sorely\nunderutilised. When imagining it live, I struggle\nto see anything other\nthan Turner taking centre\nstage, with Nicholas\nO\u2019Malley, Jamie Cook,\nand Matt Helders lurking\ntentatively behind him,\ncontributing infrequent\nchords or the occasional,\nlonely drum.\nBut on reflection, I\nreally do enjoy the album.\nI didn\u2019t expect them to\nrecreate an old sound, but\non first listening I did experience the shock felt by\nso many. It is incredibly\ndifferent; and although\nit was a pleasant expe-rience, I did not feel any\nof the emotional response\nthat their music usually\ninduces. However, on\nevery subsequent relisten,\nI have taken away something new from it. It\u2019s\nsubtle, complicated, and,\nwhile a bit pretentious,\noddly endearing. But\nthen, what else would you\nexpect from someone at\nTranquillity Base Hotel\nand Casino, observing\nus from their detached\nexistence?\nThe new Central Library design looked a little odd // Domino\nMUSIC\nHannah Cudmore\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Arctic Monkeys.\nLabel: Domino.

Their debut,\nWhatever People Say I\nAm That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not,\nwhich became the fastest\nselling debut in British\nmusic history, is a fast\npaced, highly charged\nrecord. Moving away\nfrom this style, they\nexplored more melodic\ndescriptions of love and\nheartbreak before arriving\nat AM in 2013, which\nenjoyed a huge commercial success with its dark\nand lustful tones. Five\nyears on, they have finally\nreleased something new\nand the main questions\nthat preceded it were how\nthey would sound now?\nWould they rehash AM\u2019s\nwinning formula? No, of\ncourse not.\nThis album is a far\ncry from any that the\nArctic Monkeys have\n\u201c\u2018It is hard\nto believe\nthey would\nhave turned\nto social\ncommentary\nand politics\nfor inspiration.\nBut here we\nare\u201d\nAlex Turner is a clever\nman, some of his lyrics\nare truly beautiful and\nresonate with the listener.\nHowever, at what point\n\n"

This\nservice can link into other\nsupport networks, such as\nthe Disability Advisory\nService or the personal\ntutor system, should the\nstudent desire.\nAt its most basic level,\nthe current problems with\nthe Counselling Service\ncan be reduced to simple\neconomics: the supply\nhas not increased in line\nwith demand. While the\nnumber of students registered has increased by\nover 80% since 2012/13,\nthe number of sessions on\noffer have only increased\nby 60%. The results are\nwaiting times that have\nslowly been creeping up\nevery year, and which now\nstand at over seven weeks\nbetween first contact and\nregular counselling.\nThese are just average\ntimes: students have an-ecdotally reported waiting\ntimes of up to 15 weeks,\nwhile the longest anyone\nwaited from assessment to\ncounselling last year was\nover nine months. These\nfigures can represent the\nextremes \u2013 students who\nrequest specific counsellors or can only attend at\ncertain times will need\nto wait longer \u2013 but the\nwaiting time is far above\nthe average 15 working\ndays most universities\nreport.\nincreased financial pressures associated with\nliving in London; the rise\nof social media; greater\ndemands on students to\nperform academically.\nThe list goes on. In reality\nit is a combination of all\nthe above driving the\nincrease in demand.\nNevertheless, for the\ntime being the Counselling Service is stuck in\nlimbo. The College, which\nlast year made nearly\n\u00a3120 million in surplus,\nare currently undertaking\nrounds of financial plan-ning, after which Rosie\nwill know how much, or\nhow little, she will have to\nwork with.\nProfessor Simone\nBuitendijk, Vice-Provost\n(Education), who is\nresponsible for a number\nof aspects of the student\nexperience, including\nwelfare, told Felix the\nCollege were planning on\nincreasing the support to\nthe Counselling Service:\n\u201cIn the short term we are\nplanning to increase the\nnumber of contact hours\nwe can offer each week.\nIn order to provide the\nbest service we can, we\nwill continue to prioritise\nthose in urgent need.\u201d\n\u201cOur investment in\nstudent counselling will\nbe increased significantly\nin the next financial year.\nIn parallel the College is\nworking to put in place\na new student support\nstrategy which will pro-actively help to reduce\nstress. This includes\ntackling issues related to\nthe academic experience\nwhich we know can\nexacerbate pre-existing\nmental health problems.\nIt also includes initiatives\nto help students maintain\na healthy lifestyle \u2013 both\npersonally and academically \u2013 with the aim that\nwe will reduce the need\nfor counselling as a consequence.\u201d\nThere is frustration\namong students, however,\nthat any increases in\nfunding are coming too\nlate. Imperial advertises\nthe Counselling Service\nwithin its prospectus, and,\nin the words of one student\nwho has done work with\nrecruitment, \u201cit\u2019s sold\nas part of the package\nof being an Imperial\nstudent.\u201d For Claire, this\nlack of comprehensive\nsupport was one of the\nmost frustrating aspects\nof her experience: \u201cWe\npay so much, but then we\ndon\u2019t get anything for our\nfees \u2013 I\u2019m paying around\n\u00a310,000, but others can be\npaying \u00a330,000. Students\nbring in money and a\ngood reputation for Imperial, and then we don\u2019t get\nbasic things like proper\nmental health support.\u201d\nShervin Sabeghi,\nWelfare Officer of the\nRoyal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU) says he\nhas experienced more\nstudents speaking to him\nabout external private\nservices, as \u201cthey have no\nconfidence that they\u2019ll be\nseen quickly enough by\nthe Counselling Service\u2026\nin the very short term\nCollege should be ensuring all students who need\nit can access counselling\nin a reasonable time.\u201d\nunacceptable. The Union\nis firm in the conviction\nthat student wellbeing,\nin particular counselling and mental health\nsupport services, are not\nan optional extra, but a\ncore requirement of any\nuniversity. The Union\nis pleased to see that in\nmany meetings, staff are\nopenly making the same\nchallenges, however we\nare aware we cannot\nbecome complacent.\u201d\n\u201cThe Union\u2019s role\nin supporting students\u2019\nwelfare is one of passionate advocacy. In line with\nOur Strategy 2017-20,\nwe have been lobbying\nthe College to review the\nway it approaches student\nsupport, and provide a\nmore comprehensive of-fering. Our objective is to\nwork in partnership with\nthe College to improve\nstudents\u2019 wellbeing and\namplify the student voice,\nand that\u2019s exactly what\nwe\u2019ve been doing. The\nStudents at Imperial are requesting more counselling than ever before // Imperial\n\u201cImperial\nreport seven\nweeks' average\nwaiting time\u201d\nof Earth Science and\nEngineering, tell me they\nare spending more time\nspeaking with students\nfacing difficulties than\nthey usually would; \u201cwe\ncan\u2019t emphasise enough\nhow we don\u2019t mind this\nas far as our own time\nis concerned, but we\u2019re\nnot mental health professionals\u201d \u2013 they only have\ntraining in Mental Health\nFirstAid \u2013 \u201cand inevitably\ncan\u2019t even pretend to give\nsome students the support\nthey need.\u201d\nthe Union\u2019s Wellbeing\nRepresentation Network\n(WBRN), a new body\nof student volunteers responsible for signposting\nstudents to appropriate\nresources and feeding\nback wellbeing-related\nconcerns to staff, said the\ncurrent situation made her\nfeel helpless: \u201cWhere do\nyou send them? You get\nthese situations where\nthere\u2019s nothing you can\nsay, there\u2019s no service\nwe can send them to. In\nan ideal world the NHS\nwould pick up the slack,\nbut I do think the Counselling Service provisions\nneed to be better.\u201d\nShe recognises a similar\neffect on staff: \u201cIt\u2019s not\ngreat [for them]\u2026to feel\nthey\u2019re not doing their\njob\u201d. It\u2019s a sentiment\nechoed by Rosie: \u201cWhen\nyou feel like you\u2019re not\nmeeting the needs of\npeople who are looking\nto you, that\u2019s stressful, no\nmatter what role you\u2019re\nin.\u201d\nDr Fred Marquis,\nSenior Tutor of the Department of Mechanical\nEngineering, says: \u201cit is\nfrustrating to find out that\nwhen a student plucks\nup the courage to seek\nhelp\u2026the waiting times\nare either long internally\n(Counselling Service)\nor externally (their own\nGP).\u201d Furthermore, due\nto the transient nature of\nstudent life, a number\nof students will begin\ntherapy and not complete\nit, as they go on holiday or\nmove away.\nStaff are also vulnerable\nto mental health problems.\nOne name that repeatedly\ncrops up in my conversations with academics\non the pressures they\u2019re\nfacing is Stefan Grimm,\na professor of toxicology\nat Imperial who took his\nown life in October 2014.\nAn inquest later in the\nacademic year heard how\nProfessor Grimm was at\nthe informal stage of the\nCollege\u2019s management\nprocess, following difficulties in obtaining more\ngrant money; while it is\nimpossible to say whether\nor not action taken by\nthe College would have\nchanged the outcome, an\ninternal review concluded\nthere should be increased\nsupport for struggling\nstaff members.\nWhen I speak to Dr\nMartyn McLachlan, Director of Undergraduate\nStudies (DUGS) in the\nDepartment of Materials, he says Professor\nGrimm\u2019s case brought\nattention to \u201can issue that\nhad been going on for a\nlong time, and possibly\nstill continues in some\nplaces.\u201d\nChanges may have\nbeen made on campus\n\u2013 Rosie tell me the idea\nof a work-life balance\nis embedded in a way it\nwasn\u2019t a decade ago \u2013 but\nthe whole landscape of\nhigher education is chang-ing, from the introduction\nof government initiatives\nsuch as the Teaching\nExcellence Framework,\nto the pension changes\nthat triggered industrial\naction last term. The\nresult is more pressure on\nstaff \u2013 both internally and\nexternally.\nMartyn tells me about\nhow the ever-increasing\nstudent numbers can\nhave an impact on staff\npressures: more students\nmeans more teaching,\nmore examinations, more\nmarking, more conver-sations; and the increase\nin taught postgraduate\ncourses, which run over\na 12-month period, mean\nstaff are often under\npressure consistently\nthroughout the year.\nHe also cites the\nincrease in data available about academics:\ninformation on how many\nstudents an academic\nteaches, how many PhD\nstudents they supervise,\nand how many papers\nthey publish is collected\nby the College. While\nthere is \u201cno direct pressure from the institution\u201d,\nhe says \u201cthere\u2019s always\nthe thought at the back\nof your mind that thinks\n\u2018well, if they have that\ndata, and they organise\nit\u2026what happens to the\nperson who\u2019s underperforming?\u2019\u201d\nMore generally, there\nis the impression that \u2013\nwhile staff and students\nare doing a lot of work\nto address mental health\nproblems \u2013 efforts are\nbeing hampered by poor\ncommunication. \u201cThere\nis a lot of good energy\ntowards increasing student\nand staff support,\u201d Rosie\nsays, \u201cit\u2019s just putting\nit all in one place, and\nmaking sure it\u2019s under a\nproper strategy.\u201d She tells\nme her request to have\nStudent Space \u2013 an advice\nhub for students \u2013 on the\nfront page of Imperial\u2019s\nwebsite was denied by the\nCollege, who said it was\nnot possible\nme, \u201cI'd love to do social\nanxiety as well, which I\nthink is rampant, but not\nspoken about. I\u2019d like\nto do sleep hygiene. I\u2019d\nlike to do a mood boost\nprogramme. I\u2019d like to do\na transitions workshop for\nstudents who are coming\nin, and going out. I\u2019d like\nto go into departments.\nThere are lots of things I\u2019d\nlike to do. But we don\u2019t\nhave the resources. We\u2019ve\ngot a waiting list. We\u2019ve\ngot people waiting for\nthree months. We can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a7\nWhile it may be tempting to think of waiting\ntimes as an issue for only\nstudents, the lack of comprehensive mental health\nsupport can have a knock-oneffectonstaffmembers,\nparticularly those who are\nin student-facing roles.

The number of students accessing the counselling service increased\nby roughly 80% since\n2012, but the number of\nstudents at Imperial has\nonly increased by 12.14%\nin the same time. There\nare various theories to\nexplain the increase: a\nreduced stigma around\nseeking help; an increased\natmosphere of openness\nwithin the College; an\nuncertain and anxious\npolitical environment;\nCont. from front\nCont. page 6\n\u201cThe lack of\nsupport is\nfrustrating for\nstudents\u201d\nFintan O\u2019Connor, the\nUnion\u2019s Deputy President\n(Welfare), told Felix:\n\u201cThe Counselling Service\u2019s capacity is clearly\ninadequate and Imperial\nCollege Union consistently voices this fact to\nthe College.

There\nis one argument, amidst\nthe many banded about,\nwith which I take issue,\nand that I wish to try\nand address here. Whilst\nthe argument is one that\nis used to advocate a\npro-abortion rights stance,\nI want to be clear that I\nam not arguing against\nhaving the right to have\nan abortion, but against\nthe logic, and claimed\nimportance, of a specific\nargument used for it; each\nside retains legitimate and\nlogical arguments, and I\nam not coming down on\neither side.\nThe argument in\nquestion, used by\npro-abortion rights activ-ists, is this: \u201cI believe that\na woman has the right to\nchoose what to do with\nher body\u201d.\nIn my opinion, although\na woman\u2019s choice certainly comes into the issue to\nsome degree, it is not the\ncentral point on which the\ndebate rests, and its continued inflammatory use\nsuggests you are either for\nwomen having any right\nto choose anything, and\nso pro-abortion rights, or\nagainst women having the\nright to choose anything,\nand so against, creating\nan unnecessary stifling of\nopinion and discussion.\nThe debate of abortion\nultimately rests on at\nwhat stage one believes\nan unborn foetus is alive,\nsuch that its termination\nis considered either an\ninnocuous action, like\nremoving a small growth\nof cells, or such that its\ntermination is considered\nequivalent to killing\nanother human being.\nFor instance \u2013 do we\npropose that the child is\nentirely not alive before\nbirth, even a few seconds\nbefore delivery? I doubt\nthat most people would\nagree with that. Similarly, I doubt most people\nwould describe a day-old\nzygote as being alive; so\nthe answer must lie in a\ngrey area somewhere in\nbetween.\nIf you believe that the\nunborn foetus is not alive,\nthen the expectant mother\ncan do what she likes\n(subject to my second\npoint later on), much as\nwe wouldn\u2019t care if she\nelected to have plastic\nsurgery, or get a tattoo. If\nyou believe that an unborn\nfoetus is alive, then it isn\u2019t\nsimply another part of\nthe woman\u2019s body, and a\nmore nuanced approach\nmust be taken. Is the\nfoetus fully alive, such\nthat no one has a right to\nterminate it, in the same\naround whether or not a\nfoetus is alive. Current\nrhetoric, however, seems\nto place the burden of the\nargument solely around\nthe issue of women\u2019s\nchoice, conflating the\nissues and fuelling pithy,\nvirtue-signalling arguments that don\u2019t really\ndeal with the complexity\nat stake.\nA pro-abortion rights rally in Dublin, in 2012 // Flickr/William Murphy\n\u201cCurrent\nrhetoric places\nthe burden\nof argument\nsolely around\nwomen\u2019s\nchoice, without\ndealing with\ncomplexity\u201d\nway you can\u2019t murder\nsomeone? Or is the foetus\nalive in some diminished\ncapacity? If so, what are\nthe ramifications of this?\nCan we terminate the\nfoetus if there are medical\ncomplications with the\nmother? What about when\nthere aren\u2019t any, but she\nsimply doesn\u2019t want to\nhave the baby? It is only\nat this late stage that we\ncan begin to discuss a\nwoman\u2019s right to choose,\nand thus a woman\u2019s right\nto choose is very much a\nsecondary consideration,\nplaced firmly in the\nshadow of the debate\nNow, I hear you say,\nsurely a woman has a\nright to choose for herself\nwhether she thinks the\nfoetus is alive or not,\nand act accordingly? I\nwould counter with this:\nMoral relativism, rightly\nor wrongly (a little joke\nthere), is practised in most\nsecular countries by way\nof democratic consensus:\nwe all largely agree that\nit\u2019s wrong to murder\npeople, so it\u2019s against the\nlaw. In this framework,\nI as an individual don\u2019t\nhave the right to decide\nfor myself whether killing\nis wrong, and I can\u2019t\ntake action \u2013 such as\nkilling them \u2013 based on\nmy personal assessment.\nAbortion shouldn\u2019t be any\ndifferent. With abortion, a\ncountry makes a decision\nas to how it views the life\nof a foetus, and at what\nstage, and what the laws\nshould be in line with that\nview; they thus vote on\ntheir view of morality, and\nits place in the law, in the\nsame democratic process\nthrough which all our\nlegislation is enshrined.\nIndividuals don\u2019t have the\nright to choose their own\nmorals and apply them\nin contravention to law,\nlaw that has canonised\nthe moral consensus of\nthe people. Abortion is no\nexception.\nFurthermore, the\nimplication of the binary\nnature of this argument \u2013\nyou\u2019re either pro women\u2019s\nchoice, or against it \u2013 and\nthe proxy this seems to\nplay for your stance on\nabortion also seems to\ncruelly ignore any rights\nofthefather.Afoetusisnot\nthe exclusive property of\na mother simply because\nit resides in her womb.\nBabies have fathers too.\nJust because the DNA\nof the father resides in\nthe body of the mother,\ndoesn\u2019t remove the fact\nthat it exists, and, by right\nof paternity, belongs (in\nthe way that any child\nbelongs to a parent) to\nhim. Where is his say?\nThat is not to demand that\nthe male voice overpowers or vetoes that of the\nfemale \u2013 but, as parents\nof a child, together, they\nshould be respected and\nconsulted. What does\nwomen\u2019s choice have to\ndo with the decision of two\nparents, made together?\nAgain, there is plenty of\nscope for debate around\nownership, and at what\npoint a bundle of cells\nbecomes a child, that has\nparents, who have rights;\nmy point is that, even as\na secondary argument in\nthe issue, women\u2019s rights\ndo not stand alone as a\ndeciding factor.\nTo be unequivocally\nclear: my argument is not\nfor or against actually\n\u201cThis is a\ndangerous\ngame of proxy,\nthat blurs\nlines and plays\npolitics with\nsignificant\nissues\u201d\nhaving the right to have an\nabortion. What I\u2019m trying\nto demonstrate is that\none particular argument,\nthe right of a woman to\nchoose what to do with her\nbody, is far less relevant\nto the actual issue at hand\nthan activists are making\nit. In my opinion, this is a\ndangerous game of proxy,\nthat blurs lines and plays\npolitics with serious and\nsocially significant issues.\nIt\u2019s time to repeal the 8th\nonce and for all\nIreland\u2019s abortion laws are regressive, cruel, and out of place in the modern world. It\u2019s time\nthey finally go.\nO\nn May 25th\n,\nIreland will\nbe holding a\nr e f e r e n d u m\non abortion laws, more\nspecifically on whether\nto repeal Article 40.3.3\nof its constitution (also\nknown as the 8th amend-ment). The amendment\nstates that foetuses and\nwomen are to be given\nthe same right to life, and\nhence renders abortions\nillegal \u2013 except in cases\nwhere women\u2019s lives\nare at risk. This makes\nIreland the only country\nin Europe with such tight\nlaws on abortion, with the\nexception of Malta, where\nabortion is illegal in all\ncases.\nThe referendum mainly\nstems from the death in\n2012 of Savita Halappanavar, and the following\nprotests and mobilisation\nto repeal the amendment.\nMs Halappanavar, a\n31-year old dentist, died\nfrom septic shock and\nmulti-organ failure as a\nresult from complications\nfrom a miscarriage, as she\nwas repeatedly refused\nan abortion. Her case\nCOMMENT\nLisa Hey\nComment Writer\nhighlighted the thin line\nbetween defining risk to\na pregnant woman\u2019s life\nand risk to a pregnant\nwoman\u2019s health, which\nis one of the many\ncontroversial aspects of\nIreland\u2019s current law. At\npresent, any pregnant\nfemale in Ireland apart\nfrom the circumstances\nmentioned previously \u2013\nlet her be victim of rape,\nof those terminations:\nIrish women in particular\nresort to ordering abortion\npills online, and unsafely,\nshamefully, taking them\nat home, or travelling to\nBritain where abortion\nis free under the NHS.\nAround 5,000 women a\nyear travel out of Ireland\nto abort, but it comes at\na cost that not all women\ncan afford, including of\ncourse a heavy physical\nand mental toll.\nIn some cases, women\nare forced to carry a\ndead embryo to full term\nand deliver a stillborn,\nas would have been the\ncase for Lupe, originally\nfrom Spain, who had been\ncarrying a dead embryo\nfor two months and flew\nback to her home country\nto get an abortion. In other\ncases, they are forced to\ncarry out pregnancies that\nresult from rape or incest.\nIn 2014, an asylum seeker\nwho was kidnapped,\nbeaten, and raped in her\nhome country was forced\nto keep, then prematurely\ndeliver, a baby by caesarean at 25 weeks, after\nshe threatened to go on a\nhunger strike in response\nto being repeatedly denied\nan abortion. The United\nNations and UN Committee Against Torture have\nstated in the last decade\nthat denying abortion for\na pregnancy due to rape\ncan be recognised as a\nform of torture. Similarly,\ndenying abortion in cases\nof severe and fatal foetal\nimpairment is considered\na violation of human\nrights.\nAbortion is undeniably an on-going debate\nand sensitive topic, but\nthis referendum is a\nmuch-needed step for\nIreland to bring its legislation up to a modern,\nand humane standard. The\nstrong rallying of citizens\nfor the \u2018Repeal\u2019 campaign\nshows the importance and\nrelevance of this vote.\nWhile polls were giving\na clear \u2018Yes\u2019 vote for the\npast few months, they are\nnow narrowing and giving\na less defined outcome.\nWhile every person\nis entitled to their own\nbeliefs and opinion, it\ndoes not seem empathetic\nto deny \u2013 and punish \u2013\nabortion in all but one\nunclear case, on the\nbasis of one\u2019s individual\nopinion. Repeal the 8th\nis merely about moving\non from forcing decisions\nand punishments upon\nwomen, to giving them\naccess to a possibility and\nchoice they have been so\nfar denied, that results\nfrom deeply engrained\nmentalities and religious\nvalues.\n\u201cThis is a\ndangerous\ngame of proxy,\nthat blurs\nlines and plays\npolitics with\nsignificant\nissues\u201d\nincest, undergoing a\ncomplicated or unwanted\npregnancy \u2013 incurs up\nto 14 years in prison for\nterminating a pregnancy.\nHowever, as statistics\nhave shown in various\ncountries, the number\nof abortions does not\ndecrease where abortion\nis illegal, instead having\nan impact on the safety\nIreland goes to the polls next week // Flickr/Edson Chilundo\n\n"

The guerres du\njour are served as drawn\nout, low-intensity meat\ngrinders across land, sea,\nand air, augmented by\na generous portion of\nideological \u2013 and perhaps,\none could say, memetic\n\u2013 disinformation warfare\nwaged both conventionally across mainstream\nmedia and asymmetrically on one of the most\nsophisticated pieces of\ntechnology devised by\nhumankind: the Internet.\nIn the information age,\nthe collective power and\ninfluence wielded by the\nWestern establishment\nin the government,\nmedia, intelligence, and\nmilitary spheres form the\nmost powerful arsenal\nin the battle for public\nopinion. The lionization\nof the YPG, the Kurdish\nguerrilla which form the\nbackbone of the US-supported Syrian Democratic\nForces (SDF), in the\nWestern psyche as \u201can\norganization which has\nan ideology that combines\nlibertarian socialism,\ngender equality, respect\nfor ethnic minorities,\nsecularism and green\npolitics\u201d\u2013 as described in\na recent Felix comment\npiece \u2013 is one of the most\nrecent showcases for the\npower of this propaganda\nmachine. The narrative\nfrom the Western mainstream media about this\ngroup is structurally\nsound only when supported by cherry-picked\nexamples which distort\nthe facts on the ground\nby presenting half-truths,\nor, in some cases, outright\nfalsehoods. The YPG\ncommit acts which are as\nreprehensible and against\nthe ideas of the \u201cWestern\nliberal consensus\u201d as\nany other group in this\nconflict, examples of\nwhich include:\n\u2022 The use of female\nchild soldiers under the\ninfluence of drugs\n\u2022 Admitting to use\nof civilian clothing by its\nmilitants which is a war\ncrime per Article 48 of the\nAdditional Protocol I to\nthe Geneva Conventions,\nblurring the lines between\ncombatants and civilians\n\u2022 According to the\nUN, preventing civilians\nfrom leaving Afrin and\nhence utilising them as\nhuman shields (a tactic\nalso used by ISIS)\n\u2022 Inciting and\nsupporting attacks on\ncivilians in Europe \u2013 think\nabout what the headlines\nwould have been in the\ncase of similar Molotov\nattacks backed by ISIS\nSifting through popular\nmedia outlets such as\nCNN or The Guardian, it\nis nigh impossible to find\nany reporting on these\ndeeds which would tarnish\nthe YPG\u2019s credentials.\nSuch selective reporting is, of course, not\nunique to the internet\nage. The most harrowing\nexample of this behaviour\nis The Independent\u2019s\nheroic portrayal of Osama\nbin Laden soon after the\nend of the Soviet invasion\nof Afghanistan, when his\nfighters were still useful\nCIA assets. However,\nwhether delivered by\nthe far more pervasive\nplatform of the Internet or\nvia the ancient-yet-proven\nmedium of newspapers,\nthe main objective behind\nsuch pieces is often\ndrumming up support for\ninterventionist foreign\npolicy objectives. These\npolicies have already\nled to disastrous consequences not only in the\nwarzones themselves\n(attacking Afghanistan\nto destroy a regime led\nby militias who staged\n9/11 but were previously\nsupported by the CIA;\noutright lying about Iraqi\nchemical weapons as a\npretext for invasion; \u201chumanitarian interventions\u201d\nA child in a Syrian refugee camp // Flickr/Mustafa Khayat\nin Syria and Libya) but\nalso in Western countries\nas evidenced by the recent\nstring of Islamist terrorist\nattacks across Europe and\nas in Libya and Syria\nwhich accelerated rad-icalization of Muslims\nliving in the West and\nworsened the refugee\nwaves. The second step\nis the radicalization of\nthe Euro-American right\nwhich leads to further\nforeign interventions.\nThe most tragic manifestation of this causation\nloop in the UK was the\nManchester bombing in\n2017, where the attacker\nwas trained by the Libyan\nIslamic Fighting Group \u2013\nan organization funded by\nthe MI:6 in the 1990s to\nassassinate Gaddafi.\nIn response to the Manchester bombing, Jeremy\nCorbyn faced excoriating\nresponses for suggesting\nthat failure in foreign\npolicy played a central\nrole in the propagation\nof extremist ideologies,\nand that the war on terror\nwas a failure. Upon closer\ninspection, it is painfully\nobvious that whenever\nWestern groups support\nforeign armed groups, it\ninevitably amplifies suffering for both the people\nin those countries and the\nWest itself. The world is\nnow teetering on the edge\nof a war in Iran following\nUS President Trump\u2019s\ndecision to withdraw from\nthe nuclear deal. To break\nthis cycle of madness, it\nis increasingly important\nto write to your MP, vote\nfor non-interventionist\ncandidates, and oppose\nall foreign intervention \u2013\nwhether that intervention\ntakes the form of a supposedly Icelandic Pirate\nParty-esque militia or of\na conventional invasion.\nOtherwise, the tragedies\nof Iraq, Libya and Syria\ncould repeat in Iran in\n2019.\n\u201cIt is painfully\nobvious that\nWestern\nintervention\namplifies\nsuffering\u201d\nthe USA.\nIn fact, a feedback\nloop created in the wars\u2019\neffects in Europe is the\nmost peculiar \u2013 it is a\ntwo-step process initiated,\nironically, by Western\ninterventions, such those\n\n"
