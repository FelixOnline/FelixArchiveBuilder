    "content": "ISSUE 1703\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nPieces of a Man is introspective, indulgent, and\ninaccessible\nDespite lavish production, the latest effort by Mick Jenkins never really gets off the ground. Loosely narrating the\nfragments and facets of a person\u2019s life, Jenkins\u2019 jigsaw seems to be missing a piece.\nT\nwo years after\nhis ambitious\nbut inconsistent\nand occasionally preachy release The\nHealing Component,\nMick Jenkins has dropped\na new album, Pieces of a\nMan. Four singles were\nreleased prior to the album\u2019s unveiling, but the\nbest two of these were\ninexplicably not included\non it. This is frustrating,\nas these (\u2018Bruce Banner\u2019,\n\u2018What Am I To Do\u2019) are\nfar more compelling than\nany song that actually\nmade the cut.\nMick is known for\nintricate wordplay and\nsmooth, jazzy production,\nwhich Pieces of a Man\nhas in spades, along\nwith a more organic and\nlaid-back sonic palette\nthan found on any of his\nprevious work. However,\nwhat is missing from this\nalbum, which was an\nimportant component of\nwhat made his previous\nworks great, is compelling song structures and\ncatchy, memorable hooks.\nWhat is presented on this\nnew album is a set of\nfourteen tracks (and three\nsupposedly profound skits\nthat seem unfocused and\nfail to combine into a\ncoherent message), which\nare, compared to his\nprevious effort, extremely\nlinear and uneventful.\nThirty seconds into most\nsongs, you will have heard\neverything the instrumental is going to do; there\nare no interesting beat\nswitches or compelling\nchoruses.\n\u201c53 minutes of\nsongs that all\nhave the same\ntone really\ndrag\u201d\n\u201cIt really can\u2019t\nbe overstated\njust how linear\nand repetitive\nthese songs\nare\u201d\nThis is the primary\nissue with Pieces, and the\nreason it feels even longer\nthan its 53 minute run-time: a lack of compelling\nsong structure. Mick still\nbrings incredibly precise,\nhoned flows and smart\nlyricism, but the songs\nboreyou.Halfwaythrough\nthe album I felt exhausted\nand in desperate need of\na standout moment that,\nsadly, never came. This\nis in stark contrast to his\nlast album, where songs\nlike \u2018Drowning\u2019 and \u2018The\nHealing Component\u2019\nfeatured layered and\nclimactic structures, and\ngave the album a sense\nof unpredictability and\nvariety.\nWhilst his previous\nalbum had a few bad\nsongs, which Pieces\navoids by having a consistent quality, its highs\noutstripped anything\noffered here. There are no\nstandouts. \u2018Plain Clothes\u2019\noffers a change of pace\nfrom the linear beats as\nMick swaps his rapping\nfor soulful singing, but it\nis nowhere near as good\nas his best sung tracks\n(see: \u2018Drowning\u2019, \u2018Spread\nLove\u2019).\nAdding to the tedium\ncreated by a lack of\nchoruses or beat switch-ups, every rapped song\nadopts a very similar\ntone and tempo. Unlike\non his breakout mixtape\nThe Water[s], which\nhad tracks where Mick\nspanned various emotions\nand levels of intensity,\nhere every song adopts a\nlaid back, quietly bragga-docious style, as if he has\nnothing to prove. Whilst\nthis fits the smooth jazz\nrap production and makes\nthisalbumrelaxingtohave\non in the background, 53\nminutes of songs that all\nhave the same tone really\ndrag if you\u2019re paying\nattention.\nPerhaps most disappointing of all is the\nlack of interesting topics\nand motifs. It\u2019s hinted\nat occasionally that the\ncentral theme is that you\nonly ever see pieces of a\nperson (which is intuitive\nhim), b) how he brings the\ntruth, or c) how hard he\nworks on his writing. But\nin no song does this hard\nwork and truth-bringing\nseem evident; despite his\nbrags about educating\nus, I can find no solid or\nprofound messages in any\nof these songs. This is in\nstark contrast to his last\nalbum, where songs like\n\u2018Spread Love\u2019 delivered a\nsincere and brave message\n(sentimentality not being\nsomething you often find\nin modern hip-hop), or\n\u2018What Am I To Do\u2019, a\nsingle released before this\nalbum which addressed\npolice brutality and is far\nmore hard-hitting and\nthought-provoking than\nany song that was actually\nincluded here.\nIt really can\u2019t be overstated just how linear and\nrepetitive these songs are,\nand how the complete\nlack of standout moments\nmakes the album feel\nthis isn\u2019t what I look for\nfrom Mick. I want songs\nthat make me stop and\nthink, interesting and\nleft-field production,\nand choruses that I can\nsing in the shower. The\nHealing Component was\na slight step down from\nThe Water[s], but still\ncontained some excellent\ntracks, whereas there\nisn\u2019t a single cut on this\nalbum that could stand\nshoulder-to-shoulder\nwith Mick\u2019s best. Whilst\nundeniably well produced\nand performed, the lack\nof a coherent theme,\nengaging song topics or\ncatchy melodies leaves\nthe album feeling hollow\nand ultimately forgettable.\nThat\u2019s seven years bad luck // Cinematic\nMUSIC\nAlex Large\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Mick Jenkins.

In fact,\nmost songs centre around\nMick a) bragging about\nhow real he is (compared\nto all the fakers around\n\u201cSmooth and\nundemanding\nbackground\nmusic\u201d\nlike a slog. Whilst every\nsong is technically well\nperformed and produced,\nthere isn\u2019t a single one\nthat I would pick out and\nplay on its own; they all\nblend together, creating\nsmooth and undemanding\nbackground music \u2013 but\n\n"

A\nbit early, I know, but it was\neither this or some of you\nwent without your weekly\ncrosswords (and all the\nother high quality articles\nwe write over here).\nNow some of you\nmight be wondering - why\nis this edition of Felix a\nbit light? A wise man once\nsaid, \"size doesn't matter\".\nSometimes the best things\nin life come in small\npackages.\nAs I'm writing this,\nHalloween ACC rages\non upstairs. Surprisingly\nnot as rowdy as I was\nexpecting. Not that I'm\ncomplaining, though if\nthere were a massive fight\nthat'd give me one more\narticle to fill up this issue.\nHalloween is a good\npoint to look back at how\nsettled into the new year\nwe are. Personally I'm not\nfor the whole thing, but I\ncan respect the time and\neffort people take into\nfashioning each costume.\nSo far in these six\nissues I've overseen as\nEditor, I've taken a completely new perspective of\nthe Union than I had as a\nstudent. It's a bit mad - it\ngoes from being that place\nyou go to after your last\nexam or when your room\nbooking falls through to\nthis whole almost-polit-ical system you have to\nnavigate. In light of the\nmany different articles\nI've had to write on it\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you! We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed \u2013 we\u2019ll teach\nyou everything you need to know. If you\u2019re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk\n(since I do get paid to do\nthis), I thought it'd be wise\nto give my hot take on its\ngeneral direction.\nI must admit, it's a bit\nnice to get away from\nwriting about facts for\nonce and just giving my\nopinion this week - you'd\nthink being a newspaper\neditor, you'd get to fill\n32 pages with whatever\nyou're thinking: not the\ncase unfortunately (bear\nthis in mind if any of you\nare thinking of running for\nFelix Editor in the future).\nEven more exciting is\ngearing up to write for\nmy old section once again\n(Music fztw); keep a look\nout for that in next week's\nedition.\nI can't end this without\nthanking my incredible\nFelix team: every single\none of the contributors\nwho've helped get this\npaper out even with one\nday less to work with\n- can't say that I ever approached my degree with\nthis level of dedication but\nI'm glad you're here to help\nout! This week the paper\nis shorter and is being sent\nto print on a Wednesday\nbecause tomorrow I will\nbe at my friend Lauren's\nfuneral.

Some, for how\nconvoluted the story has\nbecome from the original\nKingdom Hearts, but\nmany\u00adhave come to love\nthe franchise due to the\ncrossover between the\nFinal Fantasy and Disney\ncharacters, and how they\ninteract with the original\ncharacters and settings\nwithin the world of\nKingdom Hearts.\nNow, on the topic of\nDisney films, who doesn\u2019t\nlove a good Disney film?\nFrom the films that you\u2019ve\nwatched growing up, to\nthe films that you still\nwatch now, each film has\na special place in everyone\u2019s heart.

Enter\nSora, Donald and Goofy\n(those names can only be\nsaid in this order, don\u2019t\nbelieve me? Then play\nthrough any game in\nthe franchise and keep a\ncounter). Our loveable\nprotagonists have been\ntransformed into toys\nand are hunting down the\norganisation and doing\ntheir usual job of freeing\nhearts.\nUpon being thrust into\nthis world, it\u2019s immediately apparent the developers\nhave fully recreated the\nlook and feel of the Toy\nAfter the Toy Story\ngang get acquainted with\nSora, Donald and Goofy,\nwe set off to explore why\neveryone has disappeared.\nGameplay and\nMechanics\nThe core aspect of\nthe combat of Kingdom\nHearts 3 is still relatively\nthe same as the other\ntitles in the series. We still\nhave Sora mixing strong\nand fast melee Keyblade\ncombos as well as using\nhis magic abilities such as\nBlizzard and Fira.\nAn interesting\nmechanic which has been\nintroduced is that you\ncan now swap between\nthree keyblades whilst in\ncombat without having\nto go into the menu.\nWith real-time weapon\nswitching, the range of\ncombat options available\nto you has been expanded\nimmensely.\nIntroduced in Birth\nby Sleep, we see the\nShotlock mechanic return.\nThe Shotlock feature has\ntwo options, one is the\nfamiliar magical blasts\nand the other option is to\nShotlock into a flow-mo-tion attack (flow-motion\nwas introduced in Dream\nDrop Distance). Now\nback on to the point of\nkeyblade switching; with\nthe ability to change\nkeyblades in real time,\nyou have the option to\nchange your Shotlock\ncommand depending on\nthe keyblade.\nThere are new transformations introduced in\nthis game which change\nthe way Sora moves and\nfights within the game.\nThe different keyblades\nhave unique transformations which were explored\nin the Toy Box demo. The\nToy Story keyblade transforms into yo-yos and can\nsummon tea cups to attack\nthe heartless with. The\nMonsters Inc. keyblade\ncould transform into\nclaws for a range of melee\nattacks and the Tangled\nkeyblade offered a range\nof magic-based attacks.\nThe key to drawing out\nthese transformations\nwas to build up a meter\nabove the actions menu.\nYou build up energy quite\nquickly, so feel free to\nspam your special moves.\nIn the final section of\nthe demo, Sora hops into\na toy mech and battles\nother mechs. With a first\nperson camera angle, you\nfeel as if you\u2019re in control\nof an actual mech.

It offers\na new \u201cUSB-C connector,\nGigabit-class LTE, and\nup to 1TB of storage to\nenable powerful new\nmobile workflows\u201d.\nRemember how you\nhad to charge the Apple\nPencil with the charging\ncord and you sometimes\nweren\u2019t sure whether it\nwas charging or not? Well,\nthe second-generation\nApple Pencil attaches to\nthe iPad Pro magnetically\nand charges wirelessly\nwhile doing so. Now,\nyou can also tap with the\npencil more easily than\nbefore thanks to a new\ntouch sensor built into it.\nThere is also a new Smart\nKeyboard Folio with a\nstreamlined design that\u2019s\nadjustable for increased\nversatility.\n\u201cThe new iPad Pro is\na huge step forward for\npowerful, creative, mobile\ncomputing... There has\nnever been a mobile\ndevice anything like the\nnew iPad Pro; it has a\ngorgeous edge-to-edge\nLiquid Retina display that\ncurves into the corners\u2026\nand more, all packed into\na thinner device that has\nall-day battery life and\nis 25 percent smaller in\nvolume.\u201d\nThe new Liquid Retina\ndisplay in iPad Pro is made\nof precision-milled glass,\nadvanced pixel masking,\nnew backlight design and\nsub-pixel antialiasing.\nThis makes it the brightest\nand most color accurate\niPad display, with wide\ncolor support, True Tone\nand anti-reflective coating\nfor a natural, accurate\nviewing experience.\nFace ID, which is\nthought to be the \u201cmost\nsecure facial authentication system in any tablet\nor computer\u201d, has been\ninstalled in the new iPad\nPro for the first first time.\nIt is designed to work\nin any orientation, no\nmatter if you are sitting\nor standing while using\nthe iPad. This is because\nit takes advantage of the\nTrueDepth camera system\nto accurately map and\nrecognize the face. It also\ncan be used for Apple Pay,\nto gain access to secure\napps and enable Animoji\nand Memoji.\nThe iPad Pro, Apple\nPencil and Smart\nKeyboard Folio are\navailable to order starting\nfrom the 30th of October\nand are set to hit the\nstores from Wednesday,\nNovember 7th.\nArtificial Intelligence for Social Good\nG\noogle.org is an\narm of Google\nthat aims to\nsupport nonprofits through grants and\ncontributing employee\nvolunteer hours. The $25\nmillion pool announced\nrecently aims to support\nany ideas of situations\nwhere AI could be realistically applied. Winning\norganisations would not\nonly receive funding, but\nalso support in implementing their ideas. This\nsupport would be tailored\nto the organisation and\ncould include coaching\nfrom Google employees\nwith expertise or experience in AI, and credit and\nconsulting from Google\nCloud.\nA wave of ethical\nambiguity has recently\nswept over Silicon Valley,\nas Google and other tech\ngiants have been faced\nwith scenarios where it\nis difficult to tell how\nresearch in AI may be\nused in the future. For\nexample, the military\nhave shown interest in\nartificial intelligence for\nautonomous weapons, in\ninitiatives such as Project\nMaven. Facial and image\nrecognition powered by\nAI may have applications\nin surveillance.\nWhile these topics are\nrelatively controversial\nfrom their very nature, AI\nhas its doubters in other\napplications as well where\nhuman judgement plays\nan important role. This\nis because of the nature\nof AI as a black box\nthat does something the\nuser doesn\u2019t necessarily\nunderstand. Biases within\nthe training datasets used\nmay lead to implications\nin the outputs, and this\nmakes use of AI in law\nor medicine, for example,\nworrying to many experts\nand organisations.\nPublishing data and\nalgorithms involved goes\na certain distance in addressing this concern, but\nwith recent more powerful\nmachine learning tech-niques, the inner workings\ncan tend to be spun into\na more opaque web that\nwould be impossible\nto decipher even with\ntransparent data. New\nmethods are being tested\nand developed for giving\nsome kind of an insight to\nend users on the workings\nof these systems.\nThe AI for Social Good\nprogram, announced on\nMonday, would hope to\naddress these concerns,\nwhile not compromising\non Google\u2019s commitment\nto the advancement in use\nof AI, which it sees itself\nas having an important\nrole in. As Jeff Dean, the\nhead of Google\u2019s BrainAI\ndivision said, \u201cIt\u2019s really\nimportant for us to show\nwhat the potential for AI\nand machine learning\ncan be, and to lead by\nexample.\u201d\nThe new iPad pro // wccftech\nISSUE 1703\nFELIX\nTECH tecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nWelcoming the most powerful iPad Pro yet\nWith it\u2019s all-screen design, Face ID, second generation Apple Pen and more, this is said to be the most advanced\nversion of the iPad Pro\nTECH\nKrithika Balaji\nTech Editor\nHaaris Asghar\nTech Editor\nTECH\nGoogle.org, the charitable arm of tech giant Google, has launched a call for ideas to bring impact out of Artificial\nIntelligence\n\u201cThe second-generation\nApple Pencil\nattaches to\nthe iPad Pro\nmagnetically\nand charges\nwirelessly\nwhile doing\nso.\u201d\n\n"

When\nyou last tuned in in 2016,\nthe Ur-fascist narrowly\nbeat out the neoliberal\ncancellation of the future,\nand we\u2019ve been on a wild\nride for the last two years\nas Republican majorities\nin Congress and a stacked\nSCOTUS run rampant.\nIn this piece, Felix\npicks apart the whys and\nwhens; candidates and\nraces to watch, forecasting\nand polling, and what this\nall means down the line.\nFirstly - where do we\nget this stuff, anyways?\nThe Cook Political Report\ninveryhighregard,aswith\nSabato\u2019s Crystal Ball and,\nobligatorily, FiveThirtyEight (and if you\u2019re a fan\nof satire, good ol\u2019 Chapo\nTrap House). Felix only\ngets one issue a week,\nfolks; best hunting for up-to-date info elsewhere.\nFirst up: I\u2019m endorsing\na straight-Dem ballot.\nThey\u2019re practically Tories\nanyways - at least the bad\nones (i.e. most of them).\nDon\u2019t @ me, have you\nseen the news lately?\nAs always, send all\nangry correspondence to\ncomment editor Charlie\nTitmuss, please (and,\nwhile you\u2019re at it, get a\nlife).\nSo what\u2019s happening\nanyways?\nCongressional and\ngubernatorial elections.\nGovernors in a handful of\nstates are up for election,\nas are some locals (town\nselectman, or whatever -nobody cares).These folks\noften turn into presidential\ncandidates, but there\u2019s not\nmuch interesting (at least\nsince Cynthia Nixon lost\nher bid in the primaries to\nAndrew Cuomo in NY).\nThe really spicy races\nare for the House. 35\nSenate seats are up, but\nthey\u2019re mostly held by\nDems, and hence there\u2019s\nnot much chance at all to\nbreak the majority (538: 1\nin 7 chance as of writing).\nHowever, Democrats\nare projected to take the\nHouse (538: 6 in 7).\nHow\u2019s it been going?\nInterestingly. Candidates like Beto O\u2019Rourke\nhave given candidates like\nTed Cruz (R-TX) runs for\ntheir money - literally.\nO\u2019Rourke raised lots of\ndosh, and Republicans\nended up spending more\nin the state than they\nanticipated (remember,\ntwo years ago Cruz was\nthought to be presidential\nmaterial, or at least by\ndegenerates). The race\nis a toss-up. Others,\nlike Andrew Janz (v.\nincumbent Devin Nunes,\nR-CA-22) have run fairly\ncompetitive races (though\nNunes\u2019s real opponent\nis the Fresno Bee). Unfortunately, Janz doesn\u2019t\nsee to be able to pull off\nthe balance - the district\nis currently forecast as\nlikely R.\nThe Republicans are\ntheir same loathsome\nselves. \u201cDON\u2019T INTERRUPT ME, JASON!\u201d\nCruz snapped at a debate\nmoderator asking him\nabout civility in politics.\nThey\u2019re dog-whistling\nracists and are more decidedly pro-Trump than\never. I guess this is how\na cult of personality is\nestablished?\nMore macro-view plz.\nOkay; Democrats need\nto pick up 23 seats for a\nmajority in the House.\nThe NY Times estimates\n(among races in districts\nnot dyed in the wool) 15\nseats that lean Dem, held\nmostly by Republicans,\nand about 30 tossups - all\nRepublicans. There are\nanother 29 lean-R seats\nthat are already R; the\nDems should then have\nthe mileage they need\nto pick up the majority.\nFiveThirtyEight is calling\na +39 seat gain for the\nDemocrats on average,\nwith an 80% chance of\npicking up anywhere\nbetween 19 and 59 seats.\nThis will get us there.\nRepublicans, on the\nother hand, are expected\nto pick up a seat or two\nin the Senate. This is\nsomewhat unfortunate -slim margins are always\nbetter when whippping\nvotes isn\u2019t really a thing\n- but as long as the gain\nis small, it\u2019s manageable,\nespecially with control of\nthe House.\nWill the blue wave\nactually come about?\nThere\u2019s the regular ol\u2019\nopposition surge (folks\ncontent with the status\nquo are not as motivated\nto vote as those who\ndon\u2019t like what\u2019s going\non). Couple this with\nanti-Trump sentiment and\nyou have a storm on your\nhands.\nRemember: this is a\npresident who hit his-torically-low approval\nratings (he\u2019s hovering at\naround 40% now - higher\nthan usual, but most of\nthe people pulling that\nlever foam at the mouth,\nso take it with a grain of\nsalt). His administration\nis objectively the worst in\nAmerican history. We\u2019re\nliving a nightmare that\nnever seems to end (has it\nreally been near two years\nalready?).\nConsequently, there has\nbeen a massive surge in\nearly voting. Early voting\namong young people is\nup 500% in Georgia, with\nhistoric highs hit around\nthe country; turnout is\nprojected to be up 150%\nover the 2014 midterms\n(mirroring the 2016 elec-tions, 50% of the 18-to-29\ndemographic voted, as\nopposed to the pitiful\n19.9% turnout in the 2014\nmidterms) - a good bell-weather for turnout here,\nconsidering anti-Trump\nsentiment is concentrated\nin young voters.\nAnother factor is the\nprevalence of identity\npolitics in the current\npolitical climate - with\njust cause, considering\nthe present administra-tion. For example, trans\nrights do not matter in\nthe slightest to the current\nadministration. Coupled\nwith fiery rhetoric, the\ncurrent political climate is\nexperienced as an existential threat to trans people.\nExtend that - do you guys\nremember Mike Pence as\nthe guy who wanted to\nelectroshock gay people\nKick the assholes out 2018. // Wikimedia\n\u201c538 is calling\na +39 seat gain\nfor Democrats\n[in the House]\non average,\nwith an 80%\nchance of\npicking up\nanywhere\nbetween 19\nand 59 seats.\u201d\n\u201cSend all\nangry letters\nto comment\neditor Charlie\nTitmuss,\nplease\u201d\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY, 2ND\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n7\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\ninto being straight with\nfunding taken from AIDS\ntreatment? Maybe we\ncould bring back lynching,\njust this one time.\nPeople are still sensitive to the id-pol case\nagainst Trump; it\u2019s a valid\nargument worth listening\nto, and it\u2019s gonna move\nvoters to the polls.\nThen again, there\nare some not-so-good\nfeatures of the election\nthat definitely don\u2019t work\nin the Dems\u2019s favor. For\nexample, voting machines\nin Texas have been\nchanging Beto votes to\nTed Cruz (and somewhat\nvice versa, though\nmost of the reports I\u2019ve\nheard suggest it\u2019s going\nmajority towards Ted).\nElection machines are\nludicrously compromised;\nGeorgian infrastructure\nisn\u2019t even supported by\nthe vendor any more. Gerrymandering also affects\nHouse races, providing\na systemic disadvantage\nto Democrat voters (to\nthe extent that they need\n~55% of the popular vote\nto take the House).\nAnd there\u2019s the usual\nvoter suppression efforts...\nWhat\u2019s this about\nvoter suppression?\nVoter fraud is not a\nbig deal. There were four\ncases of voter fraud in the\n2016 elections. Unfortunately, this does not stop\nFox News from adopting\nthe concept into their\nrhetoric. This is a pretext\nto carry out broad vot-er-suppression efforts - in\nthe form of stringent and\nsurprisingly-early voter\nregistration deadlines,\nludicrous voter ID laws,\nand closing ballot boxes\nin cities with majority-mi-nority individuals (e.g.\nDodge City, Kansas - a\ntown with 30,000 Latino\nfolks and not one single\npolling place).\nObviously, these\nefforts are kept somewhat\nhush-hush (nobody\nwants to be known to act\nanti-democratically, after\nall), but the idea is to\ngive an edge in marginal\ncases. If you\u2019re working\ntwo full-time jobs to make\nrent, do you have the time\nor energy to drive an hour\nto the next city over just\nto pick up your special\nvoter ID (in some states,\nnot even your driver\u2019s\nlicense is sufficient). This\nbrings about a disproportionate turnout - the few\npercentage points needed,\nin many cases, to eke an\nelection (or at least to\nimprove your odds).\nTake the race for\ngovernor of GeorgiaDemocrat Stacey Abrams\nis subject to the rules set\nby secretary of state Brian\nKemp. Her opponent?\nBrian Kemp. One bus full\nof black seniors heading\ntowards the polls was\nintercepted by the police.\nOne \u201cexact match\u201d ID\nlaw he passed threatens\nto suppress 50,000 voters.\nJimmy fucking Carter\nstepped out of retirement\nto tell Kemp to resign.\nKemp\u2019s response has\nbeen to dogwhistle about\n\u201coutside agitators\u201dfamiliar to anyone who\nstudied the Civil Rights\nMovement, because this\nis how leaders would\nspeak about black people\nwithout really speaking\nabout black people. So\nmuch so, in fact, that the\nterm has its own fucking\nWikipedia article.\nHow is Trump\nreacting?\nWell, Trump\u2019s new\nthing is promising to\ncancel the 14th amendment - jus soli, or citizenship from birth in the\ncountry. This has been\nwell-established (and\nwell-tested) law since\nthe 1890s and has its\nroots in being one of the\nones passed because of\nthe whole slavery thing.\nObviously Trump doesn\u2019t\nlike the position - so, he\nthinks he can write an\nexecutive order to trample\nthe Constitution (hahaha -it doesn\u2019t work like that).\nThere\u2019s also the\nbullshit caravan story. It\u2019s\nbetter as a jazz standard,\nIMO. God, I hope this\ngasbag implodes.\nAnd the rest of the\nRepublicans?\nCowardly. Absolutely\ncowardly. Apparently\nthey\u2019ve been begging the\nDemocrats not to do any\ndigging, because they\nknow in their hearts the\nDems will pick the House\nback up, and it\u2019ll be a\nbad time for Rohrabacher\n(R-CA) and anyone like\nhim. They have skeletons\nin the closet and that\ncloset will be pried open.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nThe Republicans will\ntake the Senate.\nBesides the obvious\nmaintained control over\nevery branch of govern-ment, a Republican House\nwould be a nightmare;\nit will be read as tacit\napproval of the status quo,\nand McConnell, Trump,\n& Co. will be more emboldened than ever, and\ngive even more license\nto those working in bad\nfaith to prevent meaningful investigation into\nthe wrongdoings of the\npresent administration.\nCurrent forecasts say this\neventuality is unlikely,\nbut the prospect alone is\nrather bleak. Additionally,\nthe success of voter suppression tactics remains\nto be seen - the AbramsKemp race, for example,\nis currently in a dead heat.\nIf the Dems take\nCongress, though - all\nof a sudden, committee\ncontrol will be passed to\nSanders cheering the wrecking of the neolibs. Blessed image. // Wikimedia\nthe blues, and it becomes\nmuch more difficult for\nRepublicans to impede\ninvestigations (into, for\nexample, emoluments\nclause violations - of\nwhich Trump is very, very\nguilty).\nIn terms of the Democrats - bellweather\nprimaries in MA and NY\nshowed that the progressive wing of the party\nis gradually picking up\nsteam; as the districts are\ndyed-blue, we will greet a\nsmall but growing cohort\nof millennial candidates\n- who even describe themselves as socialists! While\nthe libs on top (Pelosi,\nSchumer, et al) want to\nmaintain their neoliberal\nhegemony, the narrative\nis shifting, as it must;\nrunning another centrist\nneoliberal in 2020 would\nbe suicide. Candidates are\nbeginning to posture for\nthe race already; Sanders\nis the clear frontrunner,\nwith others (Biden,\nBloomberg, Booker)\nlining up.\nThe Dems will oppose\nTrump; that much is\ncertain. Whether or not\nthey\u2019ll split like bad mayo\nis another. We\u2019re in for a\nraucous few years, folks.\nWhat\u2019s this about the\nDems?\nObviously the centrist\nposition has hit the\nbumpers. Nobody takes\nid-pol rhetoric without\nsupport for socio-eco-nomic programs and\nprojects such as nationalized infrastructure\nbanking, Medicare for all,\nexpanded Social Security,\nand free/cheaper university tuition. Without these\nprograms, individuals are\nleft living precarious lives;\nthey become isolated,\natomized - they begin to\nbelieve that there is no\ncoherent policy option to\nrectify their woes, as none\nare seriously discussed in\nthe upper echelons of the\npolitical establishment.\nThis is the standard\ncritique of neoliberalism.\nThis is not to say the\ncultural positions are bad;\nthis is only to say that the\npolitical basis is incom-plete, and the cancellation\nof debate on these issues\nforces individuals to seek\nalternatives - like Trump.\nTrump\u2019s nomination\nwas a perfect storm; the\nelection could\u2019ve been\nhad if Clinton had put\nforth better ideological\nprojects, as opposed to\nher bullshit appeal to\nrealpolitik. Not exactly\ninspirational.\nThe point is that we\u2019re\nlooking at a very different\npolitical landscape in the\nnext few months, one\nwhere the Dems will have\nmuch more ground for critiquing Trump, and much\nmore power to enforce it.\nBut if they make the same\nmistake as in 2016, they\nare bound to lose in 2020.\nAny parting words?\nThis is bullshit.\n\u201cThe point\nis that we\u2019re\nlooking at a\nvery different\npolitical\nlandscape\n[...] but if [the\nDems] make\nthe same\nmistake as in\n2016, they are\nbound to lose\nin 2020.\u201d\n\n"

The\nwords invoke\nan atmosphere\nof secrecy and\nevil, harkening back to\nmyths of murky waters\nand ancient terrors that\nlurk within. Throw in\nthe modern element of\ntrading and most imagine clandestine deals\ninvolving dubious characters straight out of The\nGodfather. The reality is\nless intimidating.\nDark pools refer\nto non-public stock\ntrading platforms where\nshares can be traded\nanonymously, in which\ndetails of the transaction\nand parties involved are\nnot made public. They are\nonly accessible to large\ninstitutional investors\ntransacting large volumes\nof shares, allowing both\nparties to deal at desirable\nprices. To understand dark\npools better, it is important\nto understand how the\nmodern stock exchange\nfunctions.\nFrom bustling coffee\nshops in the 17th\ncentury,\nwhere merchants and\nbrokers haggled, the\nmodern stock exchange\nhas not veered from its\nmain function: matching\nbuyers and sellers.\nCompanies listed on the\nstock exchange have\nshares being bought and\nsold regularly. Buyers\nand sellers submit orders\nthrough a broker and an\nelectronic system matches\norders to complete the\ntransaction. Whilst\nstock exchanges have\na minimum order size,\nknown as a lot size,\nthe sheer volume and\nbreadth of participants\nfrom large hedge funds\nto individual investors\ncreate a spectrum of order\nsizes: from eye-watering\ninvestors. Therefore,\npublic knowledge of large\ntransactions can influence\nthe share price of the\ncompanies involved as the\nwider market scrambles\nto profit alongside the\ninstitutions.\nFor instance, Fund B\ndecides to sell 1,000,000\nshares in Company A at\n$100.00/share on a regular\nstock exchange. The\nsell order is submitted,\nand the exchange begins\nto break down the sale\ninto smaller chunks and\nfind matching buyers.\nTraders and other market\nparticipants will notice an\nincrease of sell orders for\nCompany A, arriving at\nthe logical conclusion that\nthe \u2018smart money\u2019 have\neither; decided to take\nprofit at the current share\nprice or have knowledge\nof negative developments\nand are anticipating a\ndrop. They would proceed\nto sell the stock as well,\nplacing \u2018pressure\u2019 on the\nshare price and causing\nit to drop further. This\ncreates a ripple effect, as\nmore market participants\nget wind of price\nmovements and join in\nthe selling. This effect,\ncombined with the large\norder being broken down,\nresults in orders being\nfilled at ever decreasing\nprices, resulting in a lower\nnet price for the entire\norder of 1,000,000 shares.\nIf Fund B gets an average\nsale price of $95.00, 5%\nlower than intended,\nit represents a loss of\n$5,000,000 in potential\nprofits. The effect would\nbe similar for a Fund C\nbuying 1,000,000 shares\nat $100.00/share, as\nbuying pressure drives up\nshare prices, resulting in a\nhigher net price. Here is\nwhere a dark pool comes\nin handy for Funds B and\nC.\nIn the dark pool,\nthe electronic system\nmatches buyers to sellers\nanonymously just like a\nstock exchange. However,\norders are secret, as\nparticipants do not know\nthe price and size of\ntransactions happening\nwithin. Crucially for\npublic funds, knowledge\nof the transaction will\nonly be released after\nthe deal has happened,\nensuring the ripple\neffect from the wider\nmarket will not affect\nthe transaction. If two\nnon-public companies,\nsuch as private equity\nfirms, are involved in the\ntransactions the wider\nmarket may never hear\nof the deal as they are\nnot required to announce\nit. Trading fees in dark\npools are also cheaper\nthan exchanges. It is\nimportant to note: dark\npools are not illegal, their\noperators are registered\nand regulated by financial\nauthorities like a regular\nstock exchange. Dark\npools were initially used\nby brokerages to ease\nthe processing of large\norders and have grown in\npopularitysincethe1980s.\nOperators include banks\nsuch as Credit Suisse,\nGoldman Sachs, Citi,\nand Morgan Stanley and\nindependent brokerages\nlike ITG and LiquidNet.\nEven the London Stock\nExchange operates dark\npools: Cboe Europe and\nTurquoise Plato.\nDue to the large orders,\nexchanges are concerned\nabout the volume of\ntrading being drawn away\nfrom regular exchanges,\nresulting in lesser fees\nfor exchanges and lower\nactivity for the wider\nmarket. According to\nThomson Reuters, over\n45% of daily traded\nvolume in Europe occurs\nin off-exchange platforms\nlike dark pools. With\nsecretive deals the public\nis deprived of knowledge\nand are less empowered to\nmakeinformedinvestment\ndecisions, which breaks\ndown the trust of public\ninvestors. Subject to less\nreliable prices and lower\nliquidity, it seems unfair\nfor institutional investors\nto profit from a separate\nplatform at the expense of\nthe public.\nThe days of dark\npool trading may be\nat an end with the\nintroduction of the Mifid\nII (Markets in financial\ninstruments derivative)\nregulations by the EU\nin early 2018. Meant to\nbring transparency and\nefficiency back to the\nEuropean markets, this\nregulation seeks to drain\nEurope\u2019s dark pools and\nforce transactions back\ninto the light. Under Mifid\nII, dark pools face a twin\ncap on the amount of\ntrading that can be done.\nJust 4% of the total trading\nmillions to the lowly tens.\nIt is hard to match orders\nof the same size and it\nbecomes near impossible\nas the order size increases.\nLarge orders are broken\ndown into smaller chunks\nto be matched to sellers,\nand this happens over\ndays.\nFor example, a seller\nsubmits a sell order of\n10,000 shares in Company\nA. Should there not be a\nconcurrent buy order for\n10,000 shares of Company\nA, but instead ten buy\norders to buy 1,000 shares\neach, the larger sell order\nwill be broken down into\nten blocks of 1,000 shares.\nAn important\ndistinction with a\nstock exchange is price\ntransparency; the total\nvolume of shares in buy\nand sell orders are made\npublic along with the bid\nand ask price (i.e. the\nhighest price the buyers\nare buying or \u2018bidding\u2019\nfor a share and the lowest\nprice the sellers are selling\nor \u2018asking\u2019 for a share are\nvisible)\nPrice transparency\ncan undermine the\nprofitability of large deals.\nParticipants dealing in\nlarge volumes of shares\nare often institutional\ninvestors, whose dealings\nare closely monitored as\nan indication of \u2018smart\nmoney\u2019 movement. It\nis assumed the people\nhelming these institutions\npossess deep knowledge\nof businesses and\nvaluable insights about\nfuture potential, giving\nthem an edge over smaller\nDark Pools: Evil place or a market place?\nin any stock is allowed\nin a dark pool over a\ntwelve month period.\nSimultaneously the\ntrading of an individual\nstock across all dark pools\nis limited to 8% of the\ntotal volume in that stock.\nAccording to the Financial\nTimes, upticks in the\nmarket share of some\nexchanges were noted in\nthe week following the\nimplementation of Mifid\nII.\nHowever, as with any\nnew rule, firms have\nfound ways around\nthem. An alternative less\nregulated trading platform\nsharing numerous features\nwith dark pools, known as\nsystematic internalisers\n(SI), are gaining\npopularity. Some 24\ninstitutions have already\nadopted a SI status,\nincluding prominent\nbanks, proprietary trading\nfirms and market makers\nlike Tower Research\nCapital, Citadel Securities\nand Virtu Financial.\nWhile policy makers in\nthe EU have made clear\ntheir desire to clamp down\non dark pools, there is no\nintention to eliminate\nthem, accepting the need\nfor institutions to transact\nwithout shifting the\nmarket price. There are\nexceptions for unlimited\ntrading in dark pools for\nlarge orders. SIs with\ncheaper fees and lower\nstandards for quote sizes\nand trade reporting will\nfill gaps not big enough to\nmatch the EU\u2019s large order\nexemption rule, but large\nenough to affect market\nprices. With the UK set\nto leave the EU the matter\nof Mifid\u2019s enforcement\narises. Policy makers have\njumped into the deep end\nof regulating dark pools.\nMonster-sized transactions exist in dark pools // Imgur.com\nOff-exchange platforms makes 50% of trading // FT\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1703\nFELIX\n5\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe State of the Union\nEditor-in-Chief, Andy Djaba, gives his take on the state of the Union and the problematic\nculture at Imperial\nCOMMENT\nAndy Djaba\nEditor-in-Chief\nA\nfew weeks ago,\nI wrote a News\narticle about\na concerning\nimage that emerged\nshowing Jarlath O\u2019Hara,\nthe Managing Director of\nImperial College London,\npictured beside a man\ndressed in blackface. I was\nfirst made aware of the\nimage on 27th\nSeptember\nIf I\u2019m honest, my initial\nreaction to the picture\nwas to laugh. Not because\nI found anything particularly funny or didn\u2019t\nappreciate the seriousness\nof the situation but be-cause, unfortunately, this\nsort of problematic behaviour from people that\nshould know better has\nbecome all too prevalant a\nfeature in our daily lives. I\noften feel so helpless that\nall I can do is laugh. I was\npresent at the 5th\nOctober\nmeeting between Jarlath,\nRob Tomkies, the Union\nPresident, and concerned\nstudents who had seen\nthe image; six of whom\nare BME students. At this\nmeeting, Jarlath was repeatedly urged by almost\neveryone present to extend\nthe apology made to\nthose present to the wider\nstudent body through the\nrelease of a public state-ment/ acknowledgement.\nHowever, Jarlath declined\nto do so and, subsequently,\nthere was a general air of\ndissatisfaction following\nthe meeting.\nI have no qualms with\nJarlath\u2019s refusal to issue\na public apology; he is\nwell within his rights to\ndeal with the situation\nas he sees fit. However,\nI thought the official\nresponse of the Union\nand the Board of Trustees\nto the emergence of the\nimage was particularly\ninteresting. Jill Finney,\nthe Head of the Board\nof Trustees, began her\nstatement on behalf of\nthe Board of Trustees by\nsaying: \u201cIt is deeply unfortunate that Jarlath found\nhimself photographed in\nthese circumstances over\n12 years ago. Compromising historical images\nare increasingly a feature\nof our daily lives and it\nis incumbent upon all of\nus to ensure we do not\nparticipate or fall victim\nto them.\u201d\nI would argue that this\nresponse was inadequate\nand even bordered on tone\ndeaf. I think it\u2019s particularly telling that Jarlath is\nbeing painted as a victim\nin this situation. Although\nit is an unfortunate situation that Jarlath has found\nhimself in and it could be\nargued that there is a conversation to be had about\ncompromising historical\nimages, this should not\nbe the Union\u2019s primary\nfocus. It screams to me\nthat the Union is missing\nthe point.\nHowever, I can\u2019t say\nI\u2019m surprised. From my\nexperience, the Union\noften misses the point. My\nopinionsoftheUnionhave\nprimarily been formed\nby the four years I spent\nhere as an undergraduate\nstudent, as opposed to the\nfew months I\u2019ve spent as\nan employee of the Union.\nAlthough I would say my\nopinions are changing,\nI\u2019ve generally had a quite\nnegative view of the\nUnion, especially when\nit comes to issues of inequality and, in particular,\nrace.\nThe statement from\nthe Board of Trustees\nended with, \u201cthe Board...\nhave satisfied themselves\nthat Jarlath has no racist\nintent whatsoever\u201d. I\u2019m\nactually keen to move the\nconversation away from\nJarlath because I feel that,\nwhen discussing issues of\nrace, too much energy is\nfocused on the individuals\ninvolved rather than the\nwider issue at hand. This is\nwhat I feel the Union has\ndone with their response\nhere and it should be\nnoted that the Union is\nnot in the best position\nto judge \u201cracist intent\u201d.\nRacism is not binary. As\nwe have seen here, having\n\u201cno racist intent\u201d and even\ncommitting yourself to\nequality does not preclude\nyou from being part of or\nbeing complicit in a racist\nact.\nIn the past, College and\nthe Union have benefited\nfrom having a somewhat\napolitical student body\nand, as a result, problematic behaviour seems to\nrepeatedly go unchecked\nor is excused away as\nbeing\u201ctradition.\u201dWhether\nit be the Rugby team\u2019s\n\u201cfiesta dash\u201d fiasco, the\nfact that, as recently as\n2016, the Royal School of\nMines held fresher \u201cslave\nauctions\u201d or the fact that\n\u201cThe 15s\u201d, the Women\u2019s\nTie Club, is so-called\nbecause it was founded\nin 2015 (in contrast, \u201cThe\n22s\u201d, a male Tie Club, was\nfounded in 1922), there\nare far too many examples\nfrom recent memory of\ntimes at which the Union\nhas aligned itself with\nfrankly unacceptable be-haviour. I think it is telling\nthat, following the public\nfallout from the \u201cfiesta\ndash\u201d event, ICURFC\nfelt aggrieved enough\nto appeal the ensuing\npunishment. It says to me\nthat they felt somehow\n\u201chard done by\u201d and that\nthis punishment was too\nharsh. I\u2019m not suggesting\nthat the punishment was\ntoo lenient but, if I were\nthem, I would be counting\nmy lucky stars that the\npunishment wasn\u2019t more\nsevere. That, and the fact\nthat so little of the conversation was geared towards\nthe racist aspect of the\nincident, is indicative of\na culture of acceptance\nof problematic behaviour\nthat is festering in the\nUnion.\nHowever, it\u2019s not all\ndoom and gloom! College\nand the Union are launching multiple initiatives to\ntackle the problems with\nthe culture at Imperial,\nincluding the Race\nEquality Charter and the\nEquality, Diversity and\nInclusion Act. However\nthese initiatives require\ndifficult and often uncomfortable conversations\nand open discourse about\ninequality and attitudes\nat Imperial. With Black\nHistory Month drawing\nto a close, now is as good\na time as ever to have\nthese conversations and\nto address exactly why\nso many BME Imperial\nstudents feel disillusioned\nand disenfranchised with\nthe Union.\nIn the next phase of\nthe Union\u2019s development\nwe have to consider the\nfuture. Otherwise the\nUnion runs the risk of perpetuating a culture of in-differnce which is counter\nproductive to their ideals\nof inclusivity.\nThe Union faces a crucial period // Imperial College London\n\n"

I\nwas there, praying that\nit would add more than\nadvertising value to the\nshow.\nThe play explores\ndifferent stages of marriages from Bobbie\u2019s\nperspective through a\nseries of vignettes. It\u2019s\nBobbie\u2019s (Bobby in Sondheim\u2019s original play) 35th\nbirthday, and her friends,\nher \u201cmarried friends\u201d, as\nBobbie (Rosalie Craig)\nlikes to put it, throw a\nsurprise party to celebrate\nthe occasion. All her\nfriends want to know the\nsame thing, though. When\nis Bobbie going to get\nmarried?\nThanks to the reversal\nof genders, there is\nmore at stakes than just\npeer-pressure; female\nBobbie\u2019s biological clock\nis also racing throughout\nthe play. This is no longer\na show about a man with\ncommitment issues. It is\nso much more. Just this\nalone makes this change\nworthwhile. It is not a\nground-breaking change,\nbut it makes the play feel\nfresh.\nBobbie is not the only\ncharacter whose gender\nhas been changed. Amy\nhas now become Jamie,\nintroducing a gay couple\ninto the play. This works\nwonderfully, as it makes\nthe play beautifully\ninclusive without feeling\nforced. Bobbie\u2019s three\nlove interests are also\ngender-swapped, paving\nthe way for interesting\nyet valuable commentary\nabout dating, and the\ndifferent dating behaviour\nthat is (but should not be)\nexpected from men and\nwomen. The couple of\nDavid and Jenny is role-flipped, portraying the\nimage of a bread-winning\nwife and a stay-at-home\ndad, once again, complicating the previously stereotypical picture of the\nroles of men and women\nin marriages.\nCompany is credited to\nbe one of the first \u201cconcept\nmusicals\u201d.

Originally written\nfor a female character, it\nis refreshing to watch a\nmale character get cold\nfeet before a wedding.\nThe lyrics are hilarious,\nbut Bailey\u2019s performance\ntruly elevates the song.\nHowever, it is worth\nnoting that, at times, the\nnumber relies heavily on\ngimmicks, which make\nthe number even funnier,\nbut rather distracting.\nRosalie Craig makes\na great Bobbie, whose\nsubtle performance makes\nit clear that the show isn\u2019t\nabout Bobbie, but about\nlove and life through her\neyes. She is relatable,\nand not for one second\ndoes she seem greedy or\nunsatisfied.\nThe overall cast is also\ngreat. Mel Giedroyc and\nGavin Spokes, who have\namazing comedic timing\nand brilliant chemistry,\ncarry the roles of Sarah\nand Harry perfectly.\nThe play is directed\nskilfully by Marianne\nElliott (Angels in America,\nWar Horse, The Curious\nIncident of the Dog in the\nNight-Time), who transforms the play from being\nsimply through Bobbie\u2019s\neyes, to being in her mind\nas she explores, examines\nand compares her current\nlife to what could be if she\nwas married.\nOne particular scene is\nworth mentioning here; a\nwritten yesterday.\nThe staging matches\nthe colourful posters that\nadorn all of the walls, with\nmoving giant set pieces\nforming rooms for the\naction to take place. They\nalso make way for some\nvisual illusionism with\nclear Alice In Wonderland references, driving\nhome the point that it\u2019s\nall, in fact, in Bobbie\u2019s\nhead. Speaking of which,\nBobbie clearly stands out\nin her red dress, reinforcing how different she is,\nand how different she\nfeels from all her friends.\nHer married friends.\nIn summary, Company\nnot only matches the\nexpectations, but,w for\nthe most part, massively\nexceeds them. It is both\nentertaining and heart\nbreaking, with music to\ndie for.

    "content": "Man Booker Prize winner: Milkman a \u201cchallenging\u201d read\nBOOKS\nKambhampati\nBooks Writer\nT\nhe first thing one\nnotices about\nAnna Burns\u2019\nMilkman is the\nlack of names. The closest\nthing our protagonist gets\nto one is \u201cmiddle sister\u201d,\nand the setting is only\never referred to obliquely,\nand its characters by\nsobriquet. There is one\nparticularly fantastic early\nscene in which middle\nsister\u2019s maybe-boyfriend\nis accosted on charges of\npossessing a bit of a car\nwith a flag from \u201cover\nthe water\u201d on it. That was\nwhen the penny finally\ndropped for me, but I\nmight just be slow.\nThe second thing you\nnotice is the language.\nThe novel is almost\nentirely middle sister\u2019s\ninner monologue, and the\nlanguage is not what one\nwould expect from an 18-year-old girl growing up\nin working class Belfast\nduring The Troubles. Her\nthoughts are bizarrely\nprosaic, and Burns\u2019 style\ndisorientating. Her characters are difficult to distinguish from each other\n\u2013 throughout the dialogue\nall the characters speak in\nthe same oddly stilted and\nlong-winded manner.\nKwame Anthony\nAppiah, Chair of the Man\nBooker Prize panel, called\nit \u201cchallenging in the\nway a walk up Snowdon\nis challenging\u201d, and it\nis \u2013 it truly stretched the\nlimits of my suspension of\nbelief.\nHowever, through this\nstyle, Burns has managed\nto make every word,\nevery paragraph, every\npage feel overwrought\nand overthought, which\nperfectly captures the\noutstanding tension of her\nsetting. Her attention to\ndetail and the vernacular\nconveyed a sense of place\nto an extent that would\nbe unachievable by mere\ndescription.\nThis comes at the cost\nof making Burns\u2019 novel\nlargely impenetrable.\nAppiah said that his time\nspent reading academic\npapers on philosophy\nwere good preparation.\nFor the reader attempting\nMilkman without such\ntraining, it is easy to\nimagine the book being a\ntough read. There is more\nor less no plot for the first\ntwo-thirds of the novel,\nbut when the tension escalates and things come to\na head, Burns handles the\nnarrative deftly.\nIn the buildup to the\naction, we are treated to\nover two hundred pages\nof tension-building and\ncharacterisation. There\nare, of course, flashes of\naction (such as the aforementioned scene with\nmaybe-boyfriend\u2019s car\nbits), but these are more\nor less glossed over by\nBurns as she rushes to introduce the next character\nor drop the next nugget of\nsetting-related exposition.\nTo some extent, this\nis also part of the point.\nMiddle sister wants a\nquiet life: she reads 19th\ncentury literature whilst\nwalking to avoid having\nto interact with people,\nand would rather not have\nthe \u2018future talk\u2019 with may-be-boyfriend. When plot\nhappens to her it is always\nan inconvenience, and the\nprose treats it as such.\nThis wouldn\u2019t matter\nso much if the tension\nbuilt to a satisfying pay\noff, but it does not. We\nare, in principle, told what\nthe climax of the novel is\non page one: Somebody\nMcSomebody is going\nto assault middle sister\nand her IRA stalker, the\neponymous Milkman, is\ngoing to die. In actuality,\nthe climax of Milkman\nfeatures an assortment\nof minor side characters;\nwhen you finally reach\nthe bit you\u2019re promised\nat the start, you could\neasily miss it in that haze\nof action you\u2019ll almost\nAnna Burns is the first Northern Irish writer to win the prestigious award for her Troubles-era novel Milkman.\nNo names and no setting \u2013 Anna Burn\u2019s Booker prize-winning Milkman is a\u201cchallenging\u201dread // The Economist\nISSUE 1703\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n16\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly\nworth a read\nif you\u2019re a\nfan of seeing\nthe English\nlanguage used\nin new ways\u201d\nGautam\ncertainly be lost in.\nThere\u2019s probably a\nway in which this, too, is\nintentional, but really it\njust makes the novel feel\nunsatisfying to me. I think\nthis generally sums up\nmy position on Milkman:\nit\u2019s an incredibly clever\nnovel that is overflowing\nwith literary merit, and\ncertainly enough to justify\nthe Man Booker prize.\nHowever, it is also impenetrable and occasionally a\ntouch boring.\nIt\u2019s certainly worth\na read if you\u2019re a fan\nof seeing the English\nlanguage used in new\nways, and a book on\nNorthern Irish issues\ngetting publicity right\nnow is probably not a bad\nthing.

Analysis suggested that the move could\ncost members up to 60%\nof their pension value.\nFollowing an agreement\nbetween the University\nand College Union (UCU)\nand Universities UK\n(UUK) a panel was set\nup to review the valuation\nprocess that incorrectly\njudged the USS to have a\n\u00a37.5 million deficit.\nReleased last month,\nthe report of the Joint\nExpert Panel (JEP) set\nout five adjustments to be\nconsidered in future valu-ations. Chief among these\nis a \u201cfuller consideration\nof the employers\u2019 ability\nand willingness to bear\nrisk\u201d.\nResponding to a\nconsultation on the\nJEP\u2019s findings, a College\nstatement said: \u201cThe\nCollege is supportive of\nretaining the current...\nUSS if this is sustainable\nfrom a financial and\nregulatory perspective.\nWe are willing to increase\nour employer contri-butions...to support the\nscheme.\u201d\nLast November, the\nthen-provost Professor\nJames Stirling said the\nplanned changes were\n\u201cnecessary\u201d as the USS\nwas \u201cnot likely to be\nsustainable\u201d. UCU representatives told Felix at the\ntime that the College had\nacknowledged it could\nafford to continue with\nthe USS but had chosen\nnot to.\nAccording to one UCU\nmember, the reaction\nto the report has been\n\u201cbroadly positive\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said all along\nthe valuation is flawed and\nfinally someone is agreeing with us,\u201d they said.\nHowever, they added:\n\u201cThe only snag is making\nsure the recommendations\nAny suggestions that\nImperial cannot afford to\nsupport its staff border on\nrisible given the College\u2019s\nspending habits.\nContinuing with the\ncurrent USS plan would\ncost Imperial no more\nthan 10% of its operating\nsurplus, which 2016-17\nfigures put at almost\n\u00a3120 million. In the year\nprior, the College paid\n\u00a380 million into pensions\nfunds. Its profit over the\nsame period was \u00a378\nmillion.\nSince then, staff\nexpenditure (i.e. the\namount spent on salaries\nand pensions) has fallen\nfrom 55% to 53% of\ntotal expenditure. Failure\nto keep up with the rate\nof inflation has seen the\naverage salary at Imperial\nfall 1.1% each year since\n2005 and London living\ncosts have risen twice as\nquickly as pay. Senior\nstaff however are the most\nhighly paid of any Russell\nGroup university, averaging salaries of \u00a3280,000\neach.\nImperial is rapidly\nexpanding its property\nportfolio (already one of\nthe largest in London)\nand the College\u2019s fixed\nassets total more than \u00a31.5\nbillion. Other investments\ninclude \u00a33.5 million in\nthe tobacco industry, \u00a39\nmillion in fossil fuels,\n\u00a33.1 million in the arms\nindustry, and \u00a316 million\nin pharmaceuticals.\nThe College also benefits from controversial\ndonors such as the Sackler\nTrust \u2013 linked to the US\nopioid crisis \u2013 and the\nAtomic Weapons Establishment.\nImperial has withheld\nat least \u00a3280,000 from\nstriking staff. Deductions\nacross all Russell Group\nuniversities totaled over\n10 million. More than\n5,000 students, represented by legal firm Asserson,\njoined a class action\nlawsuit calling for partial\ntuition fee refunds as\ncompensation for missed\nteaching time. Over 3,000\nImperial students signed a\npetition to the same effect.\nThe UCU estimates that\nstudents missed almost\n600,000 hours of teaching.\nWhile many universities\nringfenced the withheld\nmoney for student support\nservices or hardship funds,\nImperial is diverting the\nmoney to the departments\nof those involved in the\nstrikes. There have been\nno guarantees that this\nwill be used to benefit\nstudents.\nUCU members are optimistic about the recommendations but will they be implented? // Joseph O'Connell-Danes\n\u201cThe College\nis supportive\nof the USS if it\nis sustainable\nfrom a\nfinancial and\nregulatory\nperspective\u201d\nof the JEP are implement-ed, which is not guaranteed at present.\u201d\nLast week, the Financial Times reported that 39\nfinance experts had urged\nthe USS to reject the JEP\u2019s\nproposals or face \u201cpernicious consequences\u201d.

We\nhad concentric circles\n(Paolo Ceribelli and Chris\nWood), origami circles\n(Caroline Preston), folded\nconcentric circles (Peter\nMonaghan), slightly\noff-centric circles (Geoff\nCatlow), a sculpture of\nconcentric circles on a\nsphere (Dee Stanford),\nand even a collection of\ncoloured circles from\nDamien himself.\nYour author isn\u2019t\nentirely sure why the\ntheme of circles is so\nstrong this year but is\nconvinced it\u2019s possible\nto somehow link it to\nBrexit and leaves this as\nan exercise for the reader.\nOther themes from this\nyear included lone trees,\ncartoonish cities, and\nvarious combinations of\nall of the above.\nIt probably hasn\u2019t\nescaped your attention\nthat all of the artists\nmentioned so far have\nbeen white and Western.\nIn general, across the fair,\nas in art in general, some\nmore diversity in both\nthe subject matter and\nthe provenance of the art\nwould have been appre-ciated; particularly when\nstaring at the 10,000th\ncityscape of New York,\nParis, or London.\nIt was refreshing to\narrive at the stall of\nArtBlue Studio from\nSingapore, one of the few\ngalleries from outside\nthe Western world,\nwhich featured such eye\ncandy as Bui Van Hoan\u2019s\npoignant monochrome\nVietnamese riverscapes\nand Lieu Nguyen Huong\nDuong\u2019s breathtakingly\npretty cherry blossoms.\nAll in all, the AAF\nremains an excellent way\nto spend a Saturday after-noon; particularly if you\nwant to learn more about\nart beyond the somewhat\npretentious headline\npieces that win the Turner\nPrize (second group plus-plus).\nThe evolution of the\nart at fairs such as this is\nalways much more rapid\nthan at static galleries and\nso it\u2019s also a good way to\nkeep up to date with the\ncutting edge. Entry was\n\u00a311 (student advance),\nglasses of champagne to\ncelebrate your affordable\npurchase were \u00a39.50, and\nthe fair will be back in\nBattersea next spring.\nLandscapes, cityscapes and concentric circles are all the rage this autumn at the Affordable Art Fair in Battersea.\nLook into our paintings... you will love art // Caroline Preston\nISSUE 1703\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cLandscapes,\ncityscapes,\nriverscapes,\nbeachscapes,\nand seascapes\u201d\n\u201cIn general,\nsome more\ndiversity in\nboth subject\nmatter and\nprovenance\nwould\nhave been\nappreciated\u201d\nHypnotic circles...?// Paolo Ceribelli\n\n"

It was nice to\nsee that the other team\nactually showed up on\ntime after the 40-minute\ngame last week. After\na quick but intense and\nserious warm-up, strong\nmotivation came for\nthe banned players who\nwanted a last win with\nthe boys to end their\nseason. This meant Imperial came firing in the\nfirst 20 minutes of the\ngame with strong carries\nand a dominant scrum\nregularly shoving back\nUCL\u2019s.

After a tough loss\nthe previous week, some\nchanges to the squad, and\nonly a few substitutes, it\nwas integral that everyone\nplays to their best form.\nOn arrival at Fortress\nHarlington, we eyed\nup the eager opposition\nalready warming up. It\nwas hard for some of their\nlarger players to not catch\nour eyes, yet this sight\nfeared no-one. We got\ninto our pristine, matching\nIC shirts and proceeded\nto warm up and prepare\nourselves for the fixture.\nIt was our kick-off, and\nas Marco Violet-Vianello\nlofted the ball into the\nair, the pressure from our\nboys was apparent. Within\na couple of minutes, a big\nhit from James King had\nsent him into a concussed\nstate. With one less substitute to support the team,\nthe start didn\u2019t seem to\nlook too hopeful. Then, lo\nand behold, some simple\nhands led the ball to the\nright-hand side of the pitch\ngiving William Ridge the\ngolden opportunity of an\noverlap to secure his first\ntry. This try set fear into\nour opponents, and surely\nthe regret of the big warm\nup session loomed after\nthey had discovered their\ncardio fitness was not up\nto scratch.\nShortly after, with\nsome great pressure\nand defence, a double\ntakedown tackle from\nskipper Michael Rudman,\nand Will Cox, had caused\na head collision for Will.\nAfter feeling a bit dizzy\nand allowing the bump on\nhis head to make its ap-pearance, it was decided\nthat a substitution was\nrequired. Some may argue\nthat an alternative reason\nhad caused this substi-tution, however I beg to\ndiffer. With now a less\nHis aggressive and determined driving technique\nhad surely translated onto\nthe rugby pitch to help\nhim score an 80m try,\nafter picking up the ball\nfrom an error of our opposition\u2019s. With Arnaud\u2019s\nenergy high at this point,\nhe managed to \u201csmoke\ntheir winger and fullback\u201d\nin the last 20m, to earn\nhimself his first IC try.\nWe now had the con-fidence, and this allowed\nus to show our skills to\nthe utmost. Tries from the\nmighty 3s were flooding in\nby now. Olivier Doustaly\nmanaged to use that\nchemistry with his fellow\nFrenchman Marco as they\nexecuted an S-pattern off\nof the back of a scrum to\ngain those last 10m past\nthe try line.\nOnce again, William\nRidge managed to get\nhimself another try,\nafter a dropped ball in\nour 22. This allowed\nfor the fresher to show\nhis worth by running\nthrough, stepping the 15\nand getting that ball down\nquick thinking and true\nflair on the blind-side\nfrom scrum half Valerio\nmeant that 2XV veteran\nIfan was over the line\nunscathed for the first\ntry of the game. Unfortunately, errors in defence lead to a scrappy\ntry by UCL shortly af-ter. The boys kept their\nheads up because we\nknew that if we played to\nsystem we would end up\nsteam-rolling them with\nour fitness and flair.\nSecond try of the\ngame came very handy\njust before half time as\nMcConkey dove over the\ntry line after a sick inside\nball from Kirrane. Second\nhalf began just as the first\nhalf did and after a couple\nphases it was decided to\ntake the 3 points to ensure\nthe victory. After the successful kick on the restart,\nthe ball went wide very\nquickly, and fresh prop\nED (@debesh) believed\nfor a moment that he was\nRieko Ioane and tore the\ndefence apart with a filthy\nstep before offering the\ntry to Sochi who ran the\nperfect support line. The\nend of the game was very\nscrappy but Jespersen\nproved to us once again\nwhat he\u2019s capable of.After\nbreaking a couple tackles\nunder the sticks.\nThe opposition utilised\nour lack of energy after\nrunning circles round\nthem to earn themselves\na few tries; however,\nthis would not destroy\nthe momentum of the IC\nboys. More tries came in\nfrom Tom Watson, and\nJack Martin-Halls with\nthe excellent assistance of\nIgnacio Manzur.\nMarco Violet-Vianello\nhad decided that he\nwanted to get himself on\nthe scoresheet. A lineout\nin our favour gave Marco\nthe chance to show his\nflair by getting past the\ncentres and follow it with\na disgraceful dink of the\nball towards the try line\nwhere we he would meet\nto secure that try.\nWilliam Ridge had\ndecided that he wasn\u2019t\nfinished. The greedy\nfresher didn\u2019t like the\nthought of having a\nsmaller percentage of the\ntotal amount of tries. He\nused an overlap to earn\nhimself the hat-trick. But\nthat still wasn\u2019t enough\nfor him! Mr Ridge had\ncertainly got himself an\nappetite for tries, so much\nso that he saw an opportunity to take a try from\na cheeky grubber kick of\nMarco\u2019s.\nAfter Marco Violet-Vianello had lost that\nopportunity to earn that\nprevious try, he decided\nto piss off the opponents\nsome more. With a few\nsteps, a twirl and some\nlarge angry UWL props,\nMarco was in the try zone.\nWith a few converted\ntries from UWL, the score\nat full time came to 59-21\nto IC. A great overall\nperformance from the\nboys, with our man of the\nmatch being Marco Violet-Vianello. A thoroughly\ndeserved W, and I hope\nthat the team can carry\nthis momentum through\nthe training sessions and\ninto the games to make\nthis a good season.\ndown the touch line with\npure pace and strength,\na definitive try therefore\ndenying him a meat pie\non his last appearance\nof the year. Thankfully,\nfines were awarded for\nthis incident. Final score\nwas 20-7 with IC 2s\ncontinuing their sublime\nform despite moving up a\nleague in what should be\na very exciting year once\nagain. On a more personal\nnote, I would like to\nthank all the boys for the\nunbelievable effort in the\npast two games, it was a\npleasure to lead you guys\nand I\u2019ll be back next year\nwith you for more flair\nand big Ws.\nICURFC 3rd\nXV\u2019s fresher Ridge builds up an appetite\n\u201cHis driving\ntechnique\nhad surely\ntranslated\nonto the rugby\npitch to help\nhim score an\n80m try\u201d\n\u201cafter a couple\nphases it\nwas decided\nto take the\n3 points to\nensure the\nvictory\u201d\nexperienced pack, as a\nresult of the previous head\ninjuries, it was decided\nthat uncontested scrums\nwere in play.\nNext up to put their\nname onto the scoreboard\nwas none other than our\ntame racing minibus\ndriver, Arnaud Tournier.\nhe went on to forget his\ncaptain RDB on the inside\nfor what would have been\n\n"

The\npolicy states:\n\"All staff (agency, permanent and student) are\nentitled to a discounted\nstaff meal whilst working\na shift of at least 6 hours.\"\nThis immediately\nraised concerns given that\na standard morning shift\nruns from 11:15 am to\n5:00 pm, which falls 15\nminutes under the 6 hour\nthreshold and, thus, leaves\nstaff with no break and\nno food following a shift.\nSeveral staff members\nvoiced further concerns\nabout what they perceive\nas unfair treatment,\nlamenting the fact that\nthey are no longer entitled\nto a free drink during\nthese morning shifts \"even\nthough they have to do a\n3 hour delivery, which is\na lot of heavy lifting and\nit takes up a lot of time\nand is very intense.\" An\nanonymous Beit bars\nstudent staff member\nadded, \"so they do a lot in\nthese morning shifts but,\nbecause it\u2019s under 6 hours,\nit\u2019s not considered hard\nwork.\" In reality, a stipulation of this policy is that\nstaff will no longer be able\nto eat unless they work an\nevening shift, which will\nthen pass midnight.\npolicy has also been\ncriticised. The policy\nstates that workers will\nbe considered guilty of\ntheft or gross misconduct\nif they breach the policy.\nOne Beit bars student staff\nmember explained:\n\"On particularly busy\nshifts, kitchen will make\nsurplus curly fries because\nobviously everyone is\ncoming in and ordering\ncurly fries and burgers,\nwhich come with curly\nfries. At the end of the\nshifts, sometimes there\u2019s\na box or two, not even a\nridiculous amount, and\nthey\u2019re saying that the\nkitchen aren\u2019t allowed\nto give that to staff; they\nhave to throw it in the\nbin. Even if the kitchen\nis closed. You can\u2019t take\nit, it would be stealing.\nIt\u2019s theft if there\u2019s surplus\nchips and you want to\neat them... all food that\nisn\u2019t eaten will have to be\nthrown away.\"\nOne of the Union's\nalleged justifications for\nthis is that \"the kitchen\nmade a 40% profit margin\ninstead of 60%- that\u2019s not\nan acceptable difference\nand, because of that, we\nneed to toughen up on it\".\nIt has also allegedly\nbeen claimed that the\nreason for the lack of\nmargin is because \"staff\nare basically not following the rules with food\".\nThe Union allegedly\nfurther justifies this policy\nby claiming \u201cit obeys the\nWorking Time Directive\u201d.\nOne Beit bars student staff\nmember commented: \"It\nsets the minimum possible break time you can set\nunder the Working Time\nDirective. The reality is,\non a 13 or 14 hour Sports\nnight, I\u2019ll get a half hour\nbreak, if that! Which is\nthe minimum amount they\ncan give... the fact that the\nUnion, which is notionally\nan organisation that cares\nabout welfare, is going\nfor the bare minimum it\ncan offer its staff in terms\nof a break is dubious.\" It\nshould also be noted that\nthe Union has violated the\nWorking Time Directive\nfor years, since the directive requires a minimum\nof 11 hours between the\nend of one shift and the\nstart of the next. The\nanonymous member\nof staff added: \"if the\nUnion is going to go 'the\nWorking Time Directive\nis really important', they\nshould actually follow the\nWorking Time Directive\nand not just the bits that\nbenefit them for profit.\"\nA concerned student\ntold Felix: \"It underscores\nsome of the hypocrisy of\ndiscussions around the\nbar... should the Union\nhave to be dragged into\ntreating its staff fairly?\u201d\nIn staff welfare\nmeetings, there has\nbeen \"general unrest\".\nA member of staff com-mented:\n\"There are very limited\nbenefits and the staff\ngenerally feel unheard\nand underappreciated. A\nbig thing is that the people\nwho are upstairs in the\nUnion and on this board\nthat make these kinds of\npolicies don\u2019t discuss it\nwith any of the student\nstaff. They don\u2019t discuss\nit with the casual staff\nor the supervisors or the\nmanagers and so these\nchanges just get implemented without thinking\nabout how it\u2019s going to\nimpact us at all. No input\nwhatsoever. There\u2019s been\na lot of upset and this is\njust going to be a massive\nkick in the teeth.\"\nThe growing unrest\ncomes amongst claims\nof alleged manipulative\nabuse, emotional manipulation and work place\nbullying within the Beit\nbars staff and following\na dispute surrounding\npaying Beit bars student\nstaff the London Living\nWage, which is afforded\nto student bar staff at\nevery other London\nuniversity. Last year, Ella\nRice (one of the student\nbar managers), started a\npetition on this which got\n900 signatures.

However,\nthe study of its impacts\nbeyond Earth is very\nrecent and could play a\nmajor role in improving\nmodern technologies. In\na study published last\nmonth, professor of astrophysics Chris Scott and\nhistorian Patrick Major\nfrom the University of\nReading reveal that the\nshockwaves produced by\nAllied bombs dropped on\nEuropean cities during\nWWII reached the edge\nof space, and temporarily\nweakened the ionosphere.\nThe ionosphere is a\nthick band in the outer\natmosphere situated\nbetween 80km and 580km\nabove the surface of\nEarth. It is formed due to\natmospheric absorption of\nX-raysandultravioletlight\nfrom the sun, and is very\nsensitive to solar activity\nsuch as the emission\nof particles carrying\nenergy, high-speed solar\nwinds and coronal mass\nejection. These events\ncan cause variances in\nthe concentration of ions\nand electrons in the ion-osphere, and thus cause\nit to become electrified.\nThe study shows that\nthe bombing raids were\npowerful enough to\nperiodically decrease the\nconcentration of electrons\nin the ionosphere, which\ncould have interfered with\nthe radio communications\nat low frequencies during\nthe conflict.\nThe researchers\ncompared daily measurements of the ionosphere\ncollected between 1943\nand 1945 by the Radio\nResearch Centre in the\nUK city of Slough, to\nthe time and dates of 152\nimportant Allied bombing\nraids over France and\nGermany during the same\nperiod. They found that\nchanges in the ionosphere\nwere occurring after\nthese raids, which were\nmeticulously recorded by\nthe German authorities\nand in the Royal Air Force\nmission logbooks. Its\n\u201ccritical frequency,\u201d or in\nother words the frequency\nof the radio waves reflected by the ionosphere\u2019s\nconstituent particles, decreased \u2013 which lead to a\ndrop in the concentration\nof electrons. To describe\nthe process mechanisti-cally, energy released by\nthe shockwaves heated\nthe ionosphere, which\nthen enabled the electrons\nto gain enough kinetic\nenergy to escape from the\nionosphere.\nAlthough temporary\nreductions in the concentration of electrons\nis usually due to the sun,\nor are caused by natural\nphenomena on Earth such\nas earthquakes, volcanic\neruptions and lightning,\n\u201cit is astonishing to see\nhow the ripples caused\nby man-made explosions\ncan affect also the edge\nof space,\u201d say the authors.\nThe paper reminds us that\nover the course of the\nwar, the Allied air forces\ndropped more than 2.75\nmillion tons of TNT \u2013 the\nequivalent of 185 Hiroshima H-bombs \u2013 and\nthat \u201ceach raid released\nthe energy of at least 300\nlightning strikes.\u201d\nOne may wonder why\nthe study didn\u2019t focus\non German bombing\nraids which occurred\ncloser to Slough, where\nthe measurements were\ntaken, such as the well-known \u201cLondon Blitz\u201d\nwhich took place between\nSeptember 1940 and\nMay 1941. As C. Scott\nexplains, \u201cthis bombing\nwas more or less contin-uous, making it difficult\nto separate the impact\nof wartime raids from\nthose of natural seasonal\nvariability.\u201d Furthermore,\nthe Allied four-engine\nplanes could carry bombs\nfour times heavier than\nthe two-engine German\nplanes, which caused\ngreater disruption and\nproduced a clearer signal.\nThis research may also\nhave a significant impact\non solving present-day\nscientific problems.\nUnderstanding the effect\nof manmade atmospheric disturbances could\nimprove communications\nand global positioning\nsystems (GPS) technol-ogy, which rely on the\nionosphere. For example,\nairplanes had to come\nback to their base in\nOctober 2003 due to GPS\ninaccuracies, which were\ncaused by disruptions in\nthe ionosphere after an\nintense storm on the sun.\nMore accurate knowledge\nof the ionosphere and the\neffects of disturbances\ncould thus help develop\nprediction models useful\nfor our modern technolo-gies.\nWhile the effects of\nthe bombing raids on the\nionosphere resulted in no\nlong-term consequences\nfor the atmosphere, the\ndestruction they caused\non the surface of Earth\nremain indelible marks\nin the world\u2019s landscapes,\ntowns, and also in the\nmemory of survivors. The\nhistorian involved with\nthe study, Patrick Major,\nreminds us of some of\ntheir experiences, such\nas \u201caircrew involved in\nthe raids reporting having\ntheir aircraft damaged by\nthe bomb shockwaves,\ndespite being above the\nrecommended height\u201d\nor \u201cresidents under the\nbombs routinely recalling\nbeing thrown through the\nair by the pressure waves\nof air mines exploding,\nand window casements\nand doors would be blown\noff their hinges.\u201d\nStudying the past to\nunderstand the present is\none message to take from\nthis pioneering work. We\nshould never forget \u201cthe\nimages of neighbourhoods\nacross Europe reduced to\nrubble due to wartime air\nraids, lasting reminder of\nthe destruction that can\nbe caused by man-made\nexplosions\u201d.\nThe bombing of Le Havre, France, on 10th September 1944 // British National Archives\nSCIENCE\nFRIDAY, 2ND\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nAn ionogram recorded in Slough at 8.30am, the morning after the Blitz began // UK Solar System Data Centre\n\n"

With the increasing popularity of self-driving cars, the famous\n\u2018trolley problem\u2019 has turned from a philosophical riddle into a real issue awaiting a solution.\nSCIENCE\nPaula Rowi\u0144ska\nScience Writer \u201cPreferences\nare for sparing\nhumans over\nanimals, the\nlives of many\nover few, and\nthe young over\nthe old.\u201d\nR\nesearchers from\nthe MIT Media\nLab\u2019s Scalable\nC o o p e r a t i o n\ngroup have surveyed over\n2 million citizens from\nover 200 countries about\nmorally difficult decisions that autonomous\nvehicles might have to\nmake. Participants played\n\u2018Moral Machine\u2019, an\nonline game designed by\nthe researchers. In a series\nof potential situations on\nthe road (mostly sudden\nbreak failures), they had\nto choose the lesser of two\nevils: for example, if it is\nmorally more acceptable\nto kill a man in the car\nor a woman with a child\ncrossing the street.\nAs well as about 40\nmillion recorded choices,\nscientists gathered a lot\nof demographic data\nsuch as the age, gender,\nor education level of the\nparticipants. However,\nthe only patterns in moral\ndecision making they\nfound were geographical\nand cultural. For example,\ncitizens of \u201ceastern\u201d\ncountries (a term defined\nby the researchers, referring broadly to Asia) were\nless likely to save young\npeople over the elderly\nthan participants from\nelsewhere.\n\u201cThe most emphatic\nglobal preferences in the\nsurvey are for sparing the\nlives of humans over the\nnorms in an emergency.\nMoreover, public engagement is the key to\nbuilding up the public\u2019s\ntrust in the new technology \u2013 a necessary condition\nto adopt autonomous\nvehicles on a large scale.\nSo far \u201cpublic interest in\nthe platform surpassed\nour wildest expectations,\u201d\nreported Iyad Rahwan,\nthe leader of MIT Media\nLab\u2019s Scalable Cooperation group.

This discovery has important implications for predicting sea level rises under climate change \u2013 rises that\nwill impact the lives of billions of people.\nSCIENCE\nPhotini Knoyle\nScience Writer\nB\ny now, many\nof us are aware\nof the 5th\nIntergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change\n(IPCC) report, which\nhas attracted a storm of\nmedia attention since its\npublication last month.\nThe report considers the\nenvironmental consequences of many possible\nclimatic scenarios. These\nconsequences include\nglobal warming-induced\nsea level rises, a product\nof the thermal expansion\nof sea water and melting\nland-ice running into the\nseas. However, there is\nmuch discourse over the\nextent and rate of future\nrises, partly due to insufficient knowledge of the\nmechanisms underlying\nmelting land-ice. Recent\nresearch from Stanford\nUniversity provides\ninsight into a possible\ncomplexity with land-ice\nmelting: the phenomenon\nof liquid water trapped\nwithin glaciers. This\nmore accurately predict\nhow melting land-ice will\nimpact our planet.\nThe researchers from\nStanford used ice-pene-trating radar to identify\ndensity variations within\nthe Store Glacier in West\nGreenland. Regions of\nhigher density indicated\ntrapped water, and higher\ndensity regions correlated\nwith glacial areas that had\nrecently been melting.\nFrom this correlation, the\nresearchers inferred that\nmeltwater had trickled\ninto, and become trapped\nwithin fractures in the ice.\nMeltwater is known to\nimpact glacial movement\nby flowing to the base\nwhere it contributes to\nbasal lubrication and a\nsubsequent increase in\nglacial sliding. The si-phoning-off of meltwater\ninto pockets within the ice\nmay modify this process,\nby either delaying or\nentirely preventing the\nmeltwater from reaching\nthebase.Howtheicemelts\nand where the meltwater\nflows will contribute to\nhow a glacier responds to\nfuture climatic conditions,\nwhich will impact the predicted timeline for future\nsea level rises.\nPrevious research\nhas focused on surface\nchanges to glacial land-scapes, whilst the Stanford\nstudy offers insight into\nmore diverse glacial melt\nmechanisms. With around\n40% of the global human\npopulation living within\n100km of coasts, the need\nfor accurate sea level predictions has never been\ngreater. The Stanford\nstudy demonstrates that a\nmore in-depth approach\nto studying and modelling\nland-ice melting will be\nrequired for climate scientists to make better predictions of future sea level\nrises, and help us prepare\nfor what the future brings.\nmechanism has not been\npreviously studied, and\nshould be considered in\nfuture models to help us\n\n"
